I have to close the deal now
Over and above 5,700,000,
you get 25% of the gross
until you recoup
what you're owed
No way! Then the film is amortized
including an overhead of 7%
plus the 300,000
for the line producer
Yeah, he's paid too
What is it?
Can't you see I'm busy?
It's an art movie, yeah
It's cultural,
along the lines of...
You'll have
all the guarantees you need
No, there's no need to worry
He's a good director
You've heard of him
I don't know
I don't know who said so
I'm not authorized
to negotiate the rent
Don't worry
There's no problem
No problem
They'll call you, stop by...
I'll ask a few question
Let's try to keep this short
So, first name and last name
- Height?
- 6 feet
- What have you done recently?
- I was in a show
- I have the 3 guns
- 1st door on the right
- Is René in?
- No, he's out
- Where's Maïté?
- Scouting the sewers
Maïté said to bring her here
from the airport
Have her wait in Maïté's office
She just got off a 12-hour flight!
I don't know. It's up to you
Why are you here?
- Maïté said...
- Said what?
- To bring her here
- Maïté's out for the day!
René has to see her
- He's out too
- Maybe he's coming
He said he wasn't
You're all so fucking incompetent!
I'm up to my ass in work
Get your shit together
Can't you get organized?
Niama Films, good morning
Oh, you're the guy
from the warehouse...
I know something was decided,
but I can't say what
I'm not authorized to...
Call the first assistant
- Are you with Maïté?
- No
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's Maggie
Where's René?
No one's here for her
It looks bad
She said she was fighting frogmen
You're not at René's yet?
At René's?
- He's been waiting for an hour
- No one told me
I left a message on your beeper
You didn't pick it up?
What about our talk?
I haven't forgotten you
Drop her stuff at the hotel
I'll be right back
Warm-up just now. Ready?
Be careful!
It buckles up here. Everywhere
It's the right size though
So what do we do?
We can take in the sleeves
even more
There's not much else to do
It's crazy. We've already cut it
and it still buckles up
We'll do it again
- Don't get upset
- I'm not upset
I need the line to be sleek
When she walks,
it keeps buckling up
It's not shiny enough
There's a spray for that
It has to be incredibly feminine
That's the thing
Can I see the masks
and hoods again?
I want latex from head to toe
This is a double-layered mask
There are two zippers
When you unzip the one in front...
you can see the face
with holes for the mouth and eyes
Not bad, huh?
There was a simpler one
The one I showed you last time
This one
With the zipper,
the mouth, the eyes...
What if it doesn't work?
Does it hug the face tight?
You can tuck it into the collar
of the cat-suit
You want to try?
Why not?
Will you hold this?
Freaky
How does it feel?
Not bad
Not bad!
Excuse me,
can I borrow your salt?
It works real well
Do you have a second?
Come on! We're waiting!
I can take my time
like everyone else!
- Not now! Let's go!
- Fuck off!
We're coming down the corridor
I read you loud and clear
Why did you tell her that?
She's under hypnosis in the scene
I thought it was important
It's best to insist
I'm not sure
she understands everything I say
Do you think she does?
Can't you smoke outside?
This is the third time! Are you deaf?
Go smoke outside!
We're shooting!
You find it funny?
You find it funny?
25 takes and you're still laughing?
It doesn't work
Help me, Zoé
Can't you put on a hood
by yourself?
What's wrong with the bonnet?
Show me
We tried tons of times
The thing is,
you have to stretch it out first
Yeah, give it a try
If you stretch it and pull it down
fast, then it works
It worked before
But it's backwards
Not at all
I did it once and I got it right!
Everyone, into position!
Ever think about changing jobs?
- That take was no good for me
- It was no good for anyone
Come here
The candelabra...
down here...
It wasn't too great
Make the sign up here
And put on the hood like I did:
Simply!
He's laughing
It's no laughing matter
Is it okay now?
Yeah, I'm done
Concentrate. Get back in the box
And let's forget
this wax museum stuff
How's it going?
Are we on schedule?
We're way behind
What?
Will we wrap on time?
I have no idea
Where's the stunt woman?
She's in wardrobe
What? Go get her!
- You promised me extra help
- I know
- I did all the packing up!
- We'll talk later!
Not now! It's too late!
Stop barking orders at me!
We have to work in an orderly way!
You're just a tidiness freak!
I certainly am!
You keep things so tidy
that your movies suck!
It's the truth!
You're part of the team
Not for much longer!
Then pack your bags!
Why should I be bossed around
by watchdogs like you?
Me, a watchdog?
You can breathe down
someone else's neck!
Don't say things now
that you'll regret later
I just want to do my job
and fix up Laure's costume
You had time to do it before!
Hands off, hands off...
Let her fix up Laure's costume
I'll murder that bitch
Keep it under control
Listen to me!
She's always the same!
Say something
We worked.
We're entitled to your opinion
I couldn't even hear you breathe!
Enough's enough!
Fuck you!
You want my opinion?
It sucks. It's shit
It sucks!
Fuck you!
That was a barrel of laughs!
He's worse than ever
- What's the problem?
- Hurry up!
The movie's at 10
Everyone left
Can I have a ride?
Hurry, get in
Finally!
I know, we're late.
After the rushes, René had a shit fit
I brought Maggie, okay?
No problem
She plays the lead role
She speaks no French
What about Markus?
Where's Markus?
He's not here yet?
He'll be late
He got in a fight with René
I bet they're still screaming away
Roland and Maurice are here
I'll have a whiskey
Hi there. You're watching this?
Meet Maggie, our leading lady
She speaks no French
It's great stuff
Don't repudiate it now
Cinema is not magic
It's a technique and a science
A technique born of science
and at the service of a will
The will of the workers
to free themselves
Tell me what happened
Don't brood all night!
There's nothing to tell.
We talked
It was... pretty heavy
He was looking daggers
the whole time
I tried turning on the radio,
and I thought he'd slaughter me
He said I didn't understand him.
That I was a mere technician...
Yeah, that's what he said
You can imagine
how well Markus took it
I was totally livid
I've been working with him
for 15 years now
Can it be that lousy?
He definitely has an eye
No, it's fine
I think so too
He got what he wanted.
It's his movie
He's pissed because it's pretty
He'll muck it up
in the editing room
- It's not as good as Feuillade
- Enough of Feuillade!
Feuillade's a drag
Unless I just don't get it
Even "Les Vampires"?
I saw two episodes on video.
Thank God I could fast forward!
It's pretty flimsy stuff
It's like serialized novels
There's a poetry to it
Well, serialized novels
were never my thing
Whatever
It's been done. Why do it again?
You know what I mean?
I told him it wasn't a good idea
It's a trap
He knew that
No, he's just starting
to realize it. I swear...
That's why he's so down
Obviously. He feels trapped
Let's change the subject
and have a drink
He takes out his problems
on everyone else
He's always been a hypocrite
That's why I told him off
He didn't like it,
but he needed to hear it
Directors thrive on hypocrisy
Yeah, but sometimes
they go overboard
I went too far railing on Feuillade
Too late now
So what's the Chinese girl like?
Not bad
I don't think she knows why she's
here or what René expects of her
She shuts up and does her job
- Does she talk about it?
- Not much
She keeps to herself
Is she bored?
I don't know
During her costume fitting,
she seemed to get into it
Her costume is...
pretty tight. All latex
It's like she was poured into it
We were in a sex shop
for God knows how long
It's the usual,
but no zippers at the breasts
There are even zippers here
But she's pretty,
so she wears it well
She's pretty all right
Is she into girls?
I don't know
I tried hitting on her
And?
I didn't insist
I don't want to fuck up
But I like her a lot
Go for it. What's there to lose?
She seems game
René will make my life hell
He's interested in her too?
If he finds out, he'll get jealous
He'll torment us
You don't have to tell him
Take her home tonight
and tomorrow on the set...
mum's the word
I don't know if she'd want to
You said that...
No, Mireille
I was talking about the costume
The costume. The tight fit,
the latex. It seemed to turn her on
It seemed to or it did?
It did. In fact, she asked
if she could buy it after the shoot
She asked you that?
When?
Here. Just before dinner
And you like her
dressed as Catwoman?
Yeah, she's great-looking
In fact...
you want to touch her.
Play with her. She's like a plastic toy!
If she asked for the costume...
- Am I that funny?
- No, go on!
Then you should go for it
You think so?
Why else would she have come?
They left her stranded at the lab
I was the only person left
She could have gone back
to her hotel
She's all alone in Paris
She has no one
If she has no one,
make the most of it
I think she likes me
And wanting the costume...
is a way of telling
you she wants you
Stop! You're wrong about
the costume! It was cut to her size
That's all it means
Analyze the situation
She follows you. She's in there,
surrounded by strangers
She can't speak a word
She's totally dependent on you
She wants to be here. It's 1 a.m.
She's shooting tomorrow
If she wasn't "into it",
she'd be in bed already
What's more, she takes you aside
to ask to buy her costume
It's obvious
It means: "I'm into it."
"I'm into wearing my costume."
Stop it! You're crazy!
Maurice, pour me a glass
I don't know which glass is mine
Your wife's a pain in the ass
What did she do?
I told her Maggie turned me on...
Now she's throwing her into my bed!
Just to screw things up
Changed your mind?
I don't know. I drank too much
She's screwing things up!
Look how she's smooth-talking her!
You'll keep quiet next time
Live and learn
Thanks, but who has to work with
her for a certain lapse of time?
I do
Louder, Jessica
He'll tell René
It'll all turn against me
You're acting like kids
Turn it down, Jessica
Room 612, please
You have several messages
- Are you okay?
- Yeah...
Can't we drive you to the hotel?
No thanks, I have my car
You sure you have a room?
I reserved it. There's no problem
I'll call you tomorrow
Here's the story:
the doctor's examining him
The tranquilizers
seem to be working
On the surface, he's calm enough
But all the same...
If he stays here,
I'm going to need a discharge
What's a discharge?
I need two people to vouch for him
Or else I'll take him in
He was rude. Wasn't he rude?
Was he or wasn't he?
I understand very well
But he's a very fragile person
Okay, forget it
The doctor said to take 2 now
and 1 tomorrow
Obviously
We should let him get some rest
Let him rest up
Half an hour to get a skeleton key!
Who knows
what may have happened to her?
- I can open it
- She's always on time
I know you can open it
That's why we're here
Turn on the light, please
Everything's okay,
so I'll go
Okay, cut
Very good. Are you okay?
We'll do it once more
I felt you were forcing it
It should come across as effortless
I was too much of a pro
I'll try to be more instinctive
You have to be even more supple
A little more... what's the word?
Feline. More feline
What are we doing?
We'll do it one last time
Positions, please!
You were supposed
to be here at 8:30
- She overslept
- Why didn't you call her?
I did call. She didn't answer
I let it ring and ring!
I bet you did!
What do you know? Anyway,
she won't start shooting until 11
That's not your problem!
Don't bother picking her up anymore
You're unreliable!
Where's René?
How should I know?
Maybe this is him calling!
Here she is
Are you ready?
- Let me take a look
- Come see
Move in closer
She's gorgeous
I'll sit here
Let me open this
How's that?
Ready?
You can announce it
Maggie Cheung. Take 1
René is a pain in the ass!
- Has he really disappeared?
- Zoé says Maïté can't find him
He's not at home
His wife is clueless
We're screwed!
Wait. It's happened before
Yeah, sometimes he's late,
but he never just vanishes
He better get back soon
Today's my last day
Tomorrow we take "Polyeucte"
to Héning-Lietard
Did "Polyeucte" do well?
Yeah. It's a 3-month tour
Incredibly well paid
Laure, follow me
I can fix your costume now
Don't iron now
Get me the costumes from the truck
- Where's René?
- No one knows. Maybe Maïté
But if she does,
she won't tell me
What do we do? Just wait?
We'll try shooting without him
If that doesn't work...
if he doesn't pop up,
we call it a day
Shit, it's all wrinkled again
What a pain
Fuck! It's ripped
It's incredibly fragile
What did you do?
I don't know. I didn't notice
Jesus Christ. What do I do now?
- You really slept with Maggie?
- Says who?
Maïté
She's telling everyone
you took her home, not to the hotel
and scored her
Those were her words
I don't fucking believe it!
What a bitch! That's total bullshit!
I never even touched her!
Don't tell her I told you
Fuck that bitch
Do you know José Murano?
Hold on. Don't move
I did a movie with him
This material really sucks
Is he a good director?
Yeah, not bad...
This isn't working
Let me try something else
Get undressed
I'll stick gaffer tape inside
He left me 3 messages this morning
He must have a role for me
Call him back for sure
Am I bothering you?
Actually, we're rehearsing
Forget it. It's a wrap
How do you know?
I know
And what about my scene?
I don't get it. What is this?
There's no call for tomorrow
Are you José Murano?
I'm sorry
- I'm late
- No problem
What will you have?
- What are you having?
- A beer
Me too
A beer for her
and another for me
We've never really met
I'm happy to get to know you better
We've never really...
spoken together
I've seen all your films
Excuse me for insisting so much
It's something of...
an emergency
Do you know why?
No, not really
Then I'll tell you
René can't finish the film
Is that definite?
The truth is,
he's had a sort of...
nervous breakdown
He's in a rest home. No need
to panic. It's in the country
There's a big garden
He agreed to it.
His doctor decided
What a disaster
We'll stop shooting
I was asked to take over
You?
It's touchy
Can I really accept?
René is a friend
Wipe the foam off
Don't let it get around
I don't understand something
Why a Chinese girl? Do you know?
René said that...
Whenever René opens his mouth,
people stop thinking!
You saw the state he's in!
Who am I to say?
He must have had a reason
I'm serious! Why a Chinese?
He said
he'd seen Maggie in a film
and it seemed self-evident
But why?
Come on... I saw "Les Vampires"
30 years ago at the Cinémathèque
Irma Vep is Paris
She's the Paris underworld
She's working-class Paris
She's Arletty!
Irma Vep
is street-thugs and slums!
"Les Vampires"
isn't Fu Manchu, right?
It's not Fu Manchu
I don't know
I don't know anymore
Can I have a light?
I've seen Maggie in the rushes
She has a nice body. She's graceful
That's totally besides the point!
I'm sure she's great
I saw her in that Jack Chan movie
What was the title?
What a piece of crap!
She was fine
But she's not Irma Vep!
I understand
I see what you mean
Anyway...
I told them I'm not working now
Things are slow
My welfare's running out
I said... I need to think. A little
They said to think fast
I said okay
But only
if I could change actresses
That Chinese girl...
she's really not for me
You'd be much better
Me?
Yes, you
Are you offering me the role?
What about Maggie?
She'll understand
She'll go back to Hong Kong
For me, this is really...
really difficult
How is it difficult. Why?
I wouldn't want people saying...
Saying what?
That I plotted to steal her role
It would be great
to play Irma Vep, but...
people talk and rumors spread fast
The "Hooting Owl" cabaret
one of Paris'
most disreputable joints
Here's fine
So we head towards Le Bourget
We have to go to...
Towards the industrial park,
but we turn off before
It's not far from Carpet Emporium
and the Decathlon warehouses
At the corner of Bricomarché,
where there used to be
a Family Furniture Outlet. You see?
Not at all. I don't know it
I'll tell you as we go along
Go towards Le Bourget
Can you wait 5 minutes, please?
After the screening,
we'll go to the production office
Okay. Will this take long?
No, it's what René edited
He did it himself?
When did he edit?
At night.
He always works that way
I see
Hi, José
I faxed you the insurance claim
Did you get it?
What? No, not over the phone
I'll come and see you. Thanks
- Where's Maggie?
- I have no idea
She said she'd come
Then she should be here
Where's Maggie?
She wasn't at the hotel
She left no message
I got her a ticket for 6:00 tonight
To be at the airport by 4:30,
she should leave her hotel at...
- Who's driving her?
- I don't know. You!
Are you crazy? I can't
I sure as hell can't! No way!
I'm meeting with the insurers.
It's urgent!
It's incredibly urgent!
Go ahead
Her ticket is for Hong Kong?
I even got her upgraded
into first class
She's not going to Hong Kong
She's going to New York
No, Los Angeles
She's meeting Ridley Scott
You got it all wrong. Totally
After seeing Ridley Scott
in New York
she's meeting her agent
in Los Angeles
It was so obvious
Since when?
She told me yesterday
She spoke to Ridley Scott yesterday
Jerome...
The screening's about to start
Come on...
We're starting now
You'll have to find someone
to replace Laure
To replace Laure?
Oh, yeah. Shit...
Are you free after the projection?
- Of course
- I need to see you
Okay
