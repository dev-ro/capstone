All good.
Kevin, can you say your name
and sport for me?
Yeah. Kevin Pearce,
and I'm a snowboarder.
What are you thinking about
Vancouver?
Are you getting excited yet
about being an Olympian?
You know, it's cool to have people
saying that you're an Olympic hopeful.
I think it says a lot and super
excited to be going for it this winter.
Now the new 22-foot wall at
the compound, how's that going?
Will it affect your performance?
The new 22-foot half-pipes have kind of
changed the way that we get to snowboard...
and the way that there's
so much more airtime...
and there's so much more, you know, just
overall time because the walls are bigger,
that you really have more time
to think about what you're doing...
and being able to do bigger
and cooler tricks.
And it's definitely
changed snowboarding.
It's gonna be the first time that we see
it in the Olympics with the 22-foot walls.
And I think people are gonna be
blown away at what they get to see.
- Bring it!
- Oh, it's a battle today.
All right, come on.
Let's get going here.
Okay, now this looks good.
I'm getting thrown down.
Oh, watch this.
Fabio's here.
Fabio.
Get in here.
Join us. Yeah.
Our parents believed in us really.
They've given us a sense of...
Belonging.
Yes. Thank you, David.
First day of practice.
Hey, what up? Kevin Pearce.
Just hanging. Frends Crew.
It's day one. Aspen.
We got the pipe to ourselves.
Are you ready?
Are you scared?
Yes! Ohh!
There's a curb
in the bottom here.
How is it?
Oh, a bit frustrating.
There's a curb.
It didn't feel as good
as I was hoping, to be honest.
Curb your enthusiasm
at the bottom?
Yeah.
It's a little bumpy
on this wall, but...
We're out here training
for the Winter Games 2010.
Road to Vancouver right now.
This is the road.
This is the road we're taking.
I don't know if it's
the correct road, but...
Fly out to Colorado, get
word it's the best pipe ever cut.
It's a pretty big disappointment
when you show up.
Are we going or are we staying?
I really don't think there's
any point of staying here.
Let's just decide right now.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
We're going to Park City.
Going to Park City tomorrow.
Yee-haw!
The conclusion of the one-day
Aspen trip... the pipe sucked.
And we're out. Peace. Whoo!
Oh, fucking happy!

How old are you, Shaun?
Nine.
Now, Shaun, every time I've
seen you ride the half-pipe,
which I saw you at camp,
and I've seen you...
I saw you boarding last year
at the U.S. Open.
You absolutely amazed me.
Now I want to know specifically,
how do you do those lovely 360s?
Well, you got to
crank your arms back,
and then once you, um,
hit the wall,
swing 'em forward.
And then once this goes,
then your legs will follow.
I was born with a heart defect.
So I had a couple of surgeries
when I was just one years old.
They said I wasn't going to
be good at sports.
But, um, you put that obstacle in
front of me and I want to overcome it.
I was competing
in the amateur events,
and I was winning everything
every single year.
And it got to the point
where I was getting, like,
vibes from the families and the kids
and the people I was competing against.
And it wasn't fun anymore.
I went pro when I was 13 and
everybody was in their, like, mid-20s.
I was trying to, like, play Pokémons
and stuff while everybody's out partying.
And I just didn't fit in.
I met Kevin when I was
about nine, 10 years old...
at the U.S. Open in Vermont.
It was, like, this tradition.
And it was myself, Kevin.
And this was a basketball game
that would take place.
And it just became,
like, our thing.
Every single year, we'd all get
together and just have a great time.
We'd go to the candy store...
sugar plums. We'd do those things.
I was always focused
on Kevin's brother.
'Cause I thought his brother
was the one to beat at the time.
And Kevin just kind of
came out of left field...
and did the younger-brother
move and became the better rider.
Yeah.
That's so easy.
So what do you think about that?
I didn't even think I flipped.
I would say Shaun was much
quicker to kind of get...
get the recognition
and the success.
Whereas Kevin didn't have that
at an early age.
So he was purely doing it
for the love of the sport,
and because he saw his
older brothers doing it.
At just eight years old,
Kevin point-blank confronted...
board-making pioneer
Jake Burton.
I asked him if they'd
make me a kids' board...
because there was
no such thing at the time.
And then, uh, a couple of weeks
later, he came back with this.
When I was 18 and he was 15,
he persuaded my parents...
and somehow got his teachers to allow
him to move out to Mammoth with me.
And that really allowed him
to snowboard full-time.
In eighth grade, I started
taking the winter term off.
And for the last three years,
I was able to homeschool,
where I did a lot of school
in the summer...
and all winter I was able
to just snowboard.
He would be up before everyone,
out the door before everyone,
and sometimes riding whole days
without us,
because it wouldn't be
good conditions.
And he would continuously
do that, day after day.
And he worked harder
than anyone.
And I think that
paid off for him.
Kevin Pearce, raised on
maple syrup, sharp cheddar,
weaned on the hills of Vermont.
This guy right here
is slaying it.
Seventeen years old
in snowboarding.
It's all about what
you're able to deliver.
And, uh, Pearce is man-size
on his delivery.
Kevin Pearce came out of
nowhere taking the win there.
Kevin Pearce, you're 17 years
old, out here doing the slopestyle.
You went up against some
big competition today.
The last couple of years it was,
like, you'd go on these trips...
and, like, you gotta
pull out your schoolbooks.
And it's so hard to be focusing on
snowboarding and focusing on school.
And so it's a big weight off the
shoulders to be done with high school...
and just, like, to have
that part of your life over.
Here he comes.
Very accomplished slopestyle,
half-pipe as well.
It's a quarter-pipe rider.
Whoa!
- Oh, shazam.
- Wow!
Great 540 right here.
Yes!
This is the tightest run
we've seen yet.
This whole year's been pretty
insane. It started off in New Zealand.
I won that.
And then from there
it got pretty crazy.
Another of the new crew
dazzling pipe fans...
all over the world
this season...
is Kevin Pearce.
Pearce has it all... the McTwist,
a 900, a 1080
and astonishing amplitude.
There's definitely
a lot of danger in it,
especially when you start getting
these 22-foot half-pipe walls.
You get rewarded by the judge
by the higher you go.
'Cause it's so difficult
to do those spins high and...
The first time I came here, I
didn't make it through pre-qualifiers.
And last year
I made it to finals.
So I've been happy on how far I've
come since I've started with the U.S. Open.
Let's give it up
for Kevin Pearce!
This whole Frends Crew...
it's just this group of kids...
that we got rolling together.
Traveling
and having a great time.
Danny, Mason, Jack, Luke,
Scotty.
Shaun's with us a bunch of
the time, which never hurts.
Took the "I" out of it. Kind of
makes sense. No "I" in "Frends."
Having that group of kids that
really get along makes it a huge help.
Come on, Kevin!
You're Snowman! Yeah!
Frends.
Back to the men's
half-pipe finals...
here at the second event of three
stops for the U.S. Snowboard Grand Prix.
What are you all doing up here?
The final standings...
Kevin Pearce... Yes!
When I was 19, that was the Olympic year.
It's 2006.
And, uh, everything I competed in
I won. I had an undefeated season.
Whoo!
Shaun White gets that much closer
to realizing his gold medal dreams.
And this is where
Shaun wants to be.
Shaun lighting it up
with a frontside 1080.
All he needs to do
is land this last trick.
An immaculate run
from Shaun White.
Shaun White...
incredible execution.
And a visibly elated
Shaun White.
Competing against Shaun is
basically competing against a robot.
It's like playing chess on the
computer and setting it to "expert."
You know, you'll never win.
And he proved that by winning every
single contest of the Olympic year.
And then the following year at the Nippon
Open in Japan, the miracle happened...
and Shaun White was not
on the top of the podium.
It was Kevin.
Shaun White from
the United States on course.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Kevin Pearce from
the United States on course.
And when I heard Kevin
beat Shaun,
it was just like,
"Wow! Did Shaun fall?"
It was like, "No, Shaun landed his
run and Kevin landed a better run."
That was just, like,
"Wow. That's insane."
Well, I thought that
there was only two runs,
so I gave it my everything
in the second run.
And-And, uh, that's all right.
Shaun got salty about it.
He was all wasted, like,
after the contest.
And, like, me and Danny and
Kevin were all, like, sharing this room.
Shaun kind of got a little pissed
off with a fire extinguisher...
and a little beer out of the
vending machines in Japan.
We get up there and, like, both
the rooms are, like, cracked open,
and there's just, like, fire
extinguisher shit, like, everywhere.
Like, dude, on my, like... I
had, like, a relatively new Mac...
that was just, like, fucked.
So, Shaun, if you see this,
you owe me a fucking computer.
So at that time,
Kevin was actually living
at Shaun's house,
and Shaun called up his mom, and he told his
mom to put Kevin's stuff on Shaun's front porch,
including $30,000 in yen.
And so after that, it was just this kind
of competitive blood between the two.
It was like, "All right, you want to
kick me out of your house?"
I'm gonna take this out
on you in snowboarding.
Are you guys...
You guys are friends?
Let's not... Let's not talk
about that part. All right.
That side of things. We
don't need him in the show.
It's all good.
No, we don't...
I don't want to talk shit.
Moving on. Um...
No, we're not very
good friends at this point.
Oh, really? Okay. That's
cool. We can skip it.
I was just trying
to get a feel for...
Just grab... Just...
I'm just talking.
Yeah.
It's cool.
I'm not trying to, like, pick...
No, no, no. No, I know.
Kevin Pearce versus...
Shaun White.
So Kevin started winning
all the big-air contests,
slopestyle contests,
half-pipe contests.
He beat Shaun. It was kind of
like this miracle year for Kevin.
And we were just kind of like,
"Where did that come from?" You know.
'Cause he was always, like... You
know, we were all neck and neck with him.
And then all of a sudden, he
kind of just flipped a switch...
and was like,
"All right. Game on."
I remember going to
Munich Air & Style.
And we were paired up
the first round.
I landed, like, the best
trick I could do.
And then Kev outdid me.
And it was just, like,
Kev's gonna kill it.
Gravity!
He was making so much money. He was making,
like, 400 G's or something like that...
in, like, three months,
you know.
It's like... It's sick.
I couldn't... I'm...
Kevin Pearce, U.S.A.
Heavy drop. Then after Shaun,
he did that front 12.
So I knew I had to step it up,
and it worked out.
Kevin Pearce,
Burton European Open winner.
Look at this... style, amplitude
and technical perfection.
For a while there, it was just
this, like, back and forth.
We would see each other
at competitions.
And it was just great to know
that he was pushing it as well.
You know, we both had...
We shared the same talent.
It was such a rare thing and
such an exciting time for us.
Bottom of the European Open,
half-pipe finals.
Just finished up the third run.
I was able to put that one down.
Shaun was in first and just, uh...
just snuck in there.
Whoo! I'm happy, man.
Great day. Great day.
8,248.
Holy shit.
All right.
Holy shit! Did you
read the caption?
"This is not Shaun White, but
Kevin Pearce might be just as good."
Ha!
What?
That is so sick.
This kid, he has given
Shaun a run for his money.
Here we go.
Giant frontside air.
Here's a big McTwist.
Stomps that down.
Cab 1080. Beautiful stomp.
The crowd is starting to
ramp up in volume.
♪
The bar has been set.
Shaun White, right now
about to take his final run.
Kevin Pearce trying to stay
calm, cool and collected.
But he knows that Shaun
is out for blood.
Here he goes. Here comes
10. What he had problems on.
There it is.
Pearce's 10s were bigger.
Yeah, he did not go as big.
What is it going to be here,
ladies and gentlemen?
It's gonna be a nail-biter.
There's Pearce's reaction.
Here's the score.
A 91.66.
I don't agree. I don't
agree with that at all, but...
I just think Kevin's
was a little bit better.
You know what, though, we were
so gunning for you, man.
So gunning for you.
Thanks.
When's the next time
you can just beat this guy?
Hey, I beat him last week.
That's not good enough for you?
I know. I want you to beat
him week. Come on, he's good.
The week after? I know...
I'm working on it.
Going into the Olympics,
Kevin was the main rival
for Shaun.
That's... That's, I think, what made
Olympics so important for Kevin,
was that he was the guy
to beat Shaun White.
Shaun took it
to that next level...
and had an entire bowl from the
mountains that they avalanched.
So all the snow
came to the bottom.
They flew everyone out there in a
helicopter, dug this pipe in the middle of...
I mean, it was
the radest thing ever.
Like two million dollars' worth of snow
moving and avalanches and heli costs.
And then no one was allowed
to ride it but Shaun.
I knew that I was gonna be expected
to do so much media and so much stuff,
that I'm, like, "Hey,
we should build a half-pipe..."
Where I can actually go ride
without dealing with people.
And the very last minute,
we're, like,
"Hey, let's get some sort of
foam pit or something like that."
Let's just try something new.
'Cause a lot of the guys in the
motorcycle world are doing that.
As soon as we heard about it,
we're just like, "Oh, great."
Like as if he wasn't
good enough.
Shaun takes it very seriously.
He had his girlfriend sign
a nondisclosure agreement...
to not let anybody know about
the tricks he was learning.
Then Kevin was, like, "Well, now we
need to go build a private half-pipe..."
And learn all this tricks if we want to even,
you know, be on the same level with him.
And then Kevin signed with Nike.
They promised, like, "Okay,
we'll make a pipe happen for you."
And Kevin invited all of us.
And that was the really big
difference between him and Shaun.
Kevin is, like, a friend,
and Shaun's this machine athlete
who has one goal only, and that is to win.
We're out here in our
little secret location...
building a half-pipe
for Kevin Pearce.
Kevin was the first person to
bring the air bag to snowboarding.
What I was imagining
is we just cut it...
cut that right there... Mm-hmm.
And just set the bag there
so these are 22.
He had this vision of building a half-pipe
and then cutting off the end of it...
and putting an air bag
at the bottom.
The way progression is
and evolution,
the sport has evolved to the point where
it's getting so ridiculously dangerous...
that it's necessary to have
a foam pit and an air bag...
to be able to learn these tricks
without getting seriously injured.
Every mountain has one now, but that
was a crazy concept to us at the time.
It was literally a Chuck fest.
And, you know, like anything you could think
of in your head, you would try on this air bag.
It just opened up
a whole new spectrum of tricks.
There's a trick me and Kev were trying to
really dial down was that cab double cork.
Moving forward in this year,
it's gonna be...
it's gonna be crazy seeing, you know,
how much half-pipe riding changes.
And it feels like if you don't
have one of those double corks,
that you're not really
gonna have a chance.
Kev tried the cab double corks
into that air bag...
probably a hundred times before he felt like
he had the motion to try them in the half-pipe.
And then he tried it
in the half-pipe...
and, like, fell super hard
but went back up.
That whole week was just
dedicated to learn new tricks.
You know, the goal was
to learn some double corks.
And, you know,
we got a couple down.
And then, you know, this was one
of the last days that this happened.
As you can see here,
it was, uh...
it was pretty bad,
but I was lucky.
You all right?
It ended up being
a pretty severe break.
You know, I had all these plans
trying to get ready for the Olympics,
and it's kind of slowed it down,
but we still got some time,
so it shouldn't be a problem
moving forward.
So then, from that summer, you know,
that was just all, like, recovery for Kev.
So Kev was, like,
biking a bunch.
He was down to, like...
like three percent body fat.
Ah, it's not gonna happen.
Like, he looked, like,
a crackhead, you know.
He was just, like... Ahh...
Just, like, so strong.
The whole pressure of the Olympics
and the hype that was on Kevin, like,
as the top pick for the Olympic
team, was just getting to Kevin's head.
So Kevin, instead of getting a
snowboard coach, he got a mental coach,
because he figured he knew snowboarding
more than any other snowboard coach did.
So he'd be fine on his own
without one.
His mental coach would
get into his head...
and just make Kevin feel like he
is Hercules and can do anything.
We all wanted to do well,
but not like Kev did.
Like, he really wanted it, and
he really was working for it,
with everything he ate,
he was just, like...
I would eat a pint of ice cream at
the end of the night or something.
- Kev might look at me, like...
- nope.
You fucker...
I'm really packing it on.
Oh, look at the fat kid.
I'm all stressed out. I-I eat
when I'm stressed out, okay?
How do you deal with pressure?
I guess I try to block it
out as much as I can and...
focus on the things
that matter...
and...
try and not focus on...
worrying to much about
beating everyone else or...
falling.
Don't like to
think about falling.
I think Aspen's going to be
a huge opportunity for us...
if we can make that pipe happen
and just have our crew riding there.
I've been trying
those double corks.
They've just been giving me
the hardest time.
I don't feel that confident yet, so,
uh, that's kind of been a battle for me.
There's a curb
in the bottom here.
We're going to Park City.
From Colorado, we ended up
driving to Park City.
It was perfect.
The pipe was great.
The weather was great. It was my brother's
birthday. Everyone was feeling great.
Ohh!
Jack's not going to want this.
So it's New Year's Eve.
It's a sunny day.
Everything's perfect.
Did our stretching.
Kev rode his bike.
I'm on the bike. And, uh,
it feels good, you know?
Everyone woke up a little
hungover, except me. I was training.
And, uh, yeah,
the pipe was good.
Way better than Aspen. Sorry,
Aspen. But it sucked over there.
And, uh, the day's only
gonna continue to get better.
I was sitting at the top
of the half-pipe with Kevin.
It was the first doubles that
we were gonna try in a long time.
I remember both of us
being super nervous.
And, uh, we were just nervous.
You know, it's always scary to
do the first double cork, you know.
So me and Kevin do, like, a
little rock, paper, scissor, shoot.
And Kevin lost,
so he dropped in.
Kevin tried the trick.
Came very close.
We look up and I see Kevin
do his cab double cork...
and just not catch anything
but his face.
And I happened to look up,
and I'm just like,
"Oh, my God. That was so bad."
It was a perfect storm of a fall. It's,
like, it couldn't have been any worse.
I started hollering
for a ski patrol.
I said, "Hey, like, we're gonna
need a helicopter up here."
I'm up there at the top
of the half-pipe,
and I'm like,
"All right, Kevin, get up."
He was just out.
You know, he was...
Blood coming out of his mouth, his nose.
Kevin is just like shaking, like
when you pull a fish out of water.
So we all just started
talking to him.
"Stay with us, Kevin. We're here.
We're here. It's gonna be all right."
We had to, like, put a tube down
his throat so he could breathe...
'cause he wasn't breathing
on his own.
Do you know...
What are they saying?
Well, we went up there.
His eye was totally swollen.
Uh, they said they blew...
he blew his pupil out,
which is the sign of
a massive head trauma.
Um...
it's... it's just
not looking good, man.
He's... He's been out for
30 minutes, knocked out.
I was in our house in Vermont,
and the phone rang.
And it was my friend Ty. And
he was at the pipe, and he said,
"Kev had a bad fall."
And he was like,
"You need to be here."
The worst was the doctor called
while I was still in Norwich and said,
"We need to put an extraventricular
drain in your son's head,
and we need your permission
to do that."
And I had no idea
what he was talking about.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Thank you so much. Bye.
So they say that he...
They're gonna do the hole,
and then they put, like,
a thing that, like, sucks out all
the blood and the fluids or whatever.
Yeah.
And then they're gonna
take him out of...
They're gonna...
The sedation will be off,
and they're gonna
try to wake him up.
They don't know if he will
wake up or if he won't wake up.
And then they won't really know how
much damage is done to the brain...
for another three to five days.
So we won't be able to see him
till his family gets there.
We flew through the night.
We got into Salt Lake...
I remember driving through the street to
the hospital, and it was New Year's Eve.
Walking into his room...
you could just tell from... I mean, he didn't
look like... he didn't look like Kevin.
He had 30 tubes in him,
and he looked like he was dead.
Just seeing him there
lying there was...
was by far the worst thing that's ever
happened... that I've ever seen or...
It was just...
There was no... It was
just numbing. It was just...
That... You know, that boy
who could do anything.
And the nurse said, "It's
really okay to touch him."
And it was really lucky
that she said that...
'cause I wouldn't have known if
that was okay or not to touch him.
I remember the doctor saying, "Do
you want to come see the scans?"
So we sat down in the middle of the
night looking at these computer images...
that really
didn't mean anything.
We had no idea
what was gonna happen.
Whether he was gonna live or die. Or if
he did live, what his life would be like.
I would constantly watch the drip
which monitored the pressure in his brain.
And, you know, the doctors had
said if the fluid is clearer it's better.
And I would just for weeks
just watch that fluid.
I think it was an e-mail
from somebody saying,
"You need to be prepared...
for the Kevin who comes back
not to be the same Kevin."
Get well, Kevin. Snowboard as
soon as you can. You're great.
And I'm a good fan of you.
A big fan.
We're holding your sign during
this competition. Let's go.
Holding it proud.
This is Shaun, Kevin.
We miss you here, man.
We're all pulling for you.
Hard to ride the pipe
without you.
Just want to tell you
I love you, buddy.
- This one's for Kev.
- Miss you out here.
- We love you, Kev.
- - Kevin, stay strong.
So I hope you get well soon.
We know you can pull through.
We're rooting for you.
- We love you tons.
- - I love you, buddy.
After how many days?
Making moves.
Making progress.
As he started to
make any recovery...
I mean, I'll never forget when I was sitting
with him and I was holding his hand...
and he moved his finger
in the palm of my hand.
And we were like, "Yes!" Like,
"He just... He moved his hand."
You know, and then
he'd open his eyes.
But you could tell,
like, he wasn't...
He'd open his eyes, but it was
as if he wasn't even looking at you.
How you doing?
You know, and then he would pinch with his
right hand, but his left hand wouldn't work.
So then we were, like,
you know, is he paralyzed?
And then he'd get
a blood clot in his arm.
You know? So it was just
constantly new hurdles to get over.
There was very little change.
And then after that, it felt like there was,
like, this amazing ladder of progression.
He still wasn't talking, but I would
play a few of his favorite playlists.
And then I played
"The Believer" by Neil Young...
and he started mouthing
the lyrics.
We were like, "Yes!" Like he's
somewhat aware of what's happening.
Like he's... he's able to sing this song
which we didn't even know he was listening to.
Do you really take precautions?
You learn how to crash. You
wear helmets. You wear padding.
You wear... You know,
you do what you got to do,
but you kind of learn along
the way how to handle it.
Okay, but sometimes
accidents happen.
Right. Absolutely. And we're
all thinking about Kevin Pearce.
We actually heard that there was
a little bit of movement there.
Uh, that he was able to do some
movement today. That was the latest word.
Show that you can stand.
Push up. Extend, extend, extend.
Good. Tighten up
the bum cheeks.
Hold your head up.
Chest up. Chest up.
This part, Kev. Up. Yep.
Up. Look up.
Now don't overextend. Just
stand up nice and tall, okay?
We were there
at the hospital, and...
another family, very like our family,
had a son who had a skiing accident.
So they were constantly asking us
questions about where Kevin was...
and what he was going through
and was he improving here and there?
And we were fortunate to always say, "Yeah,
like, every day has been an improvement."
Unfortunately, um, he didn't
make it. His name was Mark.
It's... I... It's just a total
luck of the draw, I think.
There's no reason. I mean, he was in
the same hospital with the same team...
and had a wonderful family.
He had all the same things
that Kevin had.
Oh. You know, we were sharing
the same waiting room with them.
We were sharing food with them,
you know. And then...
Kev, another great day, huh?
Did you have a great day today?
A good day.
A good day. Yeah.
It's been a great day.
A great day.
Kevin Pearce is a miracle man.
Look at this, Kev.
"Pearce be with you."
Pearce be with you.
You got some fans, don't you?
These boys.
These boys?
These boys.
You got some fans.
Do you have a nickname?
Do you know your nickname, Kev?
I don't.
You don't?
K.P.
K.P.
Yeah, I would be
completely lying...
to say that Kevin's injury
hasn't affected me.
I mean, I think about it
quite a bit.
I mean, I was standing there before
the Olympics trying to learn these tricks,
and Kevin's in the back
of my mind.
I couldn't...
I couldn't shake it.
And everywhere you would look there was these
stickers, like, you know, "I ride for Kevin."
You know, I just...
You know, I couldn't really
escape this... this feeling of, like,
you know, "Well, what if?"
What if I'm gonna crash
on this next hit?
Last night, there was
a heart-stopping moment...
when America's snowboarding superstar
Shaun White endured a scary crash.
Snowboarding superstar Shaun White,
on a practice run at the Winter X Games,
launching a double McTwist 1260
and coming up frighteningly short.
It's been a wild night for me.
I mean, hitting my head didn't help
anything. And I've been seeing stars.
How are you feeling?
You want to cry?
How come?
You do.
How are you?
After David was born,
the midwife said, "We need to tell
you that your baby has Down syndrome."
And I just didn't know
if I could do it.
Say "Hi, Rosie.
This is David."
I remember a doctor
coming in and said,
"You know, kids with Down syndrome
do really well in the Special Olympics."
And I remember thinking
that is so great.
And that was, like, so important
to me to hear something positive.
Good morning.
What morning is it?
So David is going to be
competing in the...
What events today
in the Special Olympics?
Downhill... Downhill
on the chairlift. Yep.
Whoa! This is Pia Pearce,
the mother of the Olympian.
Good morning. It is my pleasure to
be with David Pearce this morning...
as we prepare for the Special
Olympics of the year 2000.
This is the great skier in the
history of the Quechee Club.
My roly-poly... Poly.
Very strenuous.
Here we go.
David's coming down. He's doing
great. Flying down the mountain.
All right, Dave!
That was a great run...
46 seconds, Dave.
Yeah.
Very fast.
I'd say you have a medal.
David Pearce...
a post-race special.
From Upper Valley, David Pearce.
All right, David!
All right!
The incredible thing
about David...
is you have to put out
an enormous amount of energy.
We always said it was like
he was equal to five children.
But you always got back
exactly what you put out.
I wouldn't have David any
other way than the way he is.
I mean, I wouldn't swap him
for any child in the world.
He is absolutely perfect.
More medals! Yay!
Having David has been
incredibly valuable and important.
And the same thing
when Kevin was first hurt.
It was really... I needed to hear all
the things that were gonna be good,
not for people
to feel sorry for us.
Hey, everyone. Thanks for all
your support. I'm feeling better.
I'm walking around. Uh, I appreciate
everything that you guys have done.
And, uh, keep it up.

I dropped everything
I was doing. I quit my job.
And I was determined
to be by his side...
for as long as it took
for him to get better.
It felt really good, because a
lot of the times in the hospital...
I'd see other patients
without that support.
I knew what worked for him, and
not necessarily all the therapists did.
So it was easy for me to say "Let's just
turn this, like, to a competitive game,
and he'll want to do it."
Is that the best fingering? I think
you go that way it's bigger, right?
Oh, get in there.
Okay, let's talk about
Shaun White and his tricks.
We've all... We've seen the
back-to-back double corks so far.
Representing the United States
of America, this is Shaun White!
But the opener of his run, well,
that's not gonna be too shabby, either.
- Oh!
- Huge straight air for Shaun.
Setting the momentum
for the rest of his run.
Massive double cork.
Shaun's moves right now are so
much higher than the other riders.
This is unbelievable.
Shaun White just set a new bar
here in the half-pipe finals.
What are we doing, love?
We're watching
the Olympics, angel.
What's Kevin doing?
He's snoozing.
It's very exciting.
And Shaun White, of course,
back-to-back gold medalist.
Repeating his feat from Torino.
Reaching new heights
in his sport...
and enjoying every minute
of the ride... Shaun White.
Life in the hospital.
Kevin's really sick.
He's having a really hard time.
And Ellery's being
such a martyr helping him out.
Let's get up.
I want you to get up.
There was a skier... C.R.
Johnson... who'd contacted me.
He had had a traumatic
brain injury.
And all he wanted to do
was talk to Kevin.
But Kevin was still in his coma.
And so C.R. would just send
me, like, page-long e-mails,
just repeating himself
and trying to be, like,
"I want to talk to Kevin. Nobody
understands this unless you go through it."
And then while Kevin
was still in the hospital,
C.R. got another traumatic
brain injury and died.
Professional freeskier C.R.
Johnson was killed yesterday...
in a horrific fall
in California.
He was 26. Johnson had
competed in the Winter X Games.
He had a remarkable return to
skiing after suffering a brain injury...
in another skiing mishap five
years ago that left him in a coma.
I couldn't believe it.
This is real.
It's real again.
But that could happen
to Kevin in an instant.
Right after the accident,
all Kevin would talk about was,
"I want to be a pro snowboarder. I
want to go do a cab double cork."
The trick he fell on. And that really
bummed me out, because I was, like,
you don't know
what you've put us through.
♪ I see problems
down the line ♪
I mean, I'm a professional
snowboarder,
and I didn't want
Kevin to snowboard again.
It would just make me cry, because I
was like, "I don't want you to do this."
♪ Was a dirt

On February 22, I asked
Kevin to draw a person...
with all the parts
doing anything.
I don't know if you can
see this person down there.
It's not his best artwork
piece let's just say.
On the 13th of April,
draw a person,
and this guy's got a body now.
Hands that go where hands go,
legs that go where legs go.
There's still some things
we're working on.
Definitely not more aware
of your left side.
Your drew the right side of this guy's
face, and some things are a little off.
But he's getting better.
He's getting there.
Kevin, that was excellent.
I think pretty much just your toast
just shows the progress you've made.

He was so good about it.
He fully understood.
He's one of the greatest
guys I know.
He's inspirational, hard worker.

I wouldn't change
what went on between us.
I wouldn't really wish it
upon anyone.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
And I'm here to talk to you guys about
the importance of wearing helmets.
I was training for the Olympics
and hit my head really hard.
I'm very thankful that I was wearing
one of those, and that saved my life.
And after it first happened, I really
couldn't see anything out of this eye.
So it was kind of scary. I thought I might
be blind out of that eye for a little bit,
but now it's been coming back.
I still have to wear glasses
that are kind of funny looking.
I think that
is a great question.
I think that in a stage
where you're recovering...
your brain isn't at a place where it
can tell you what the right decision is,
it's good to take
advice from family.
How long am I gonna take
this advice for?
Um...
I don't know.
How much am I gonna have to
take this advice...
or until you guys will just let
me do my thing and trust me?
I feel like there's no trust in
this family of what you guys...
Whoa. of what you
guys think I can do.
And you look at it as trust,
and we look at it as risk.
And they're very,
very different, Kevin.
If you do injure yourself,
is it fair on your mother...
and the family...
to be put in a position of taking
care of you for the rest of your life?
Concentrate.

This is the wake surfing.
So this was my first time
ever doing it, and...
Boom! I can't let you do that.
I will not let you do that.
I mean, I can't advise you to
do that. You can't take the risk.
So you've been hurt
for one year.
Your brain is healing, but your
brain can't get injured again.
And the major inefficiencies
from your injury...
come from this white matter.
These wires
can only handle so much force.
The harder you whip your head
into the water,
that's a concussion.
You actually could die.
You could have brain bleeding
that's fatal for you.
But I kind of don't understand what
you're saying because I felt totally fine.
And a lot of things that I'm gonna continue
to do with my life are gonna be risky.
I understand that part of this
reevaluation may be disappointing.
You came here because you wanted
to get permission to get your life back.
And, you know,
we're not there yet.
Your primary concern
was your memory.
And what I saw
in our appointments...
was that even during
those hour times...
you forgot what you said.
So, one of the approaches,
as a trial, is gonna be...
putting you on
a memory-enhancing medicine.
My memory obviously
doesn't suck...
It could be your memory pill. It
obviously doesn't suck that bad.
If I want to remember it,
I'll remember it. That's true.
If I don't give a shit about
it, I won't remember it.
That's exactly right. So I would say
the other thing about this medicine...
is it makes you give a shit.
Last time we were together
you were like, "Yeah,
at the one year mark it's gonna be
fine for you to have a beer and whatever.
Just obviously
don't get drunk."
Then I kind of also felt like...
Well, I obviously don't remember
correctly from what you guys are saying.
It was a total one-year rehab,
and now it's clearly
a two-year rehabilitation.
Is that my brain not working... You guys telling
me that it was a one-year deal to have a beer?
Or is that... Is that something I
thought, or is that something you told me?
I think it was something
you thought.
Ladies and gentlemen, make some
noise for our brother, Mr. Kevin Pearce.
Because of all you,
because of all what you've done,
so you should be very proud of yourself,
and thank you for all the love and support.
♪
I'm Jamie Little, joined now
by the man, Kevin Pearce.
Hey, you're becoming
like a veteran announcer now.
Thanks for having me. Yeah.
It's been awesome, you know.
I can't snowboard, so I need
to stay occupied in some way.
Well, we've watched Shaun White grow up
before our very eyes here at Winter X Games.
Shaun White is to snowboarding
what Tiger Woods is to golf.
Oh! Right there,
it's a Double Mickey!
Putting it down
into the backside.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
What about that run?
Every single trick is a double
cork or a 1080 or a 1260...
or just something beyond belief.
I mean, I was
down and out for a year,
and none of that stuff was
happening two years ago.
And to come back and see how
far the sport has been progressed...
in one year
is just unbelievable.
Snowboarding is my true love.
And it's really hard to understand...
why I would ever want to get back on
a board after what I've been through...
unless if you really understood
the feeling I had for snowboarding.
It's just so exciting
that I'm gonna get back to it.
It was a couple years ago
that you got a silver medal.
I cannot wait to see you back at it
again. I can't wait. Don't tempt me.
I'll get back at it,
take him down.
Tired of this shit yet?
Oh, I'm so tired of this shit.
Let me go party. I haven't gotten
to do any fun shit this weekend.
All I've had to do is... interviews
the whole goddamn weekend.
Welcome back to ESPN 3D.
I'm Jamie Little.
Sarah Burke... She's gonna
come back for the big air final.
It's pretty cool how all these action
sports have progressed off each other.
All the tricks came from
surfing and then skating.
We've kind of all
inspired each other.
Skiers now want to be doing what all the
snowboarders are doing in the half-pipe.
And it's cool to see that after we've
followed in the skiers' footsteps for so long.
Kevin Pearce, you've been
awesome. Congratulations, buddy.
There we go. Another great
night. Thanks for your insight.
Here we are.
We're at my new house...
down here in Carlsbad,
California... Southern California.
And I just got this house
right before my injury,
and then I came back to life
and don't remember getting it,
and so it was very exciting when
I came out here for the first time.
And then I got
my roommate Haley,
and she's really helping me out with
just everything... just my whole life.
I'm not really...
It's hard to tell,
but I'm not really ready or able
to live on my own yet.
Shoot. My meds don't have
enough in 'em.
Hey, Haley.
Yeah?
Could you come in here
real quick?
I need you to help me out.
I need more meds.
Okay.
CVS Pharmacy.
How can I help you?
Hey, man. I was just calling to see if
my prescriptions were eligible for refill.
Do you know what medication?
Yeah, I got Vimpat,
Lexapro and Lamotrigine.
Do you think you can go
pick 'em up? Yeah. Of course.
The Lamotrigine is the main
seizure medication.
I'm pretty sure the Lexapro
is an antidepressant.
I'm kind of bummed that
I'm on the antidepressant...
because I feel like
I'm not depressed, but...
I'm not the doctor.
The continued rehab, you know, a
bunch of deficits that I'm dealing with,
whether it's my memory, my
attention, the confusion I have so often,
the fatigue,
the naps I take every day,
the "impulsitivity,"
the organization,
the sensory overload...
They're just kind of endless
stuff that I'm dealing with.
We have something going on here.
I have these full-on seizures
that are happening in my arm.
The doctors have been very worried
about it turning into a grand mal seizure,
because then the risk is
falling and hitting your head.
Okay. After our visit, did you notice
anything else about your vision?
Or not really?
No, not really.
To be completely honest
with you, I don't remember that.
Oh, okay.
And that's not good.
What did you tell me?
I want you to tell me
if the images...
are getting farther apart
or closer together, okay?
Look at the letter "D."
Do you see a single?
No, it's two.
Two of it.
So what we're gonna do
is surgery on both eyes.
He has a lot of things going on. There's...
When he looks up, his eyes are shaking.
When he looks down,
his eyes are shaking.
That's called nystagmus, and
the surgery can't fix that problem.
And because of the brain injury,
his brain might have a little more trouble
adjusting to the new position of his eyes,
and it might be more difficult for
his brain to fuse the two images.
I think probably this is gonna
need to be more than one surgery.
Um, because of the way
that the eye was injured,
it's not realistic to expect single
vision in every direction of gaze.
Hmm.
It's all right.
You're in the recovery room.
Relax. Kev. Kev.
Kevin? Lay back, Kevin.
Thank you.
Surgery's over. It's done.
This young man was similar to
you. He's a Boulder college student.
Hi, Grant.
This is Kevin Pearce.
How you doing, dude?
You hanging in there?
Grant's had an injury.
His family's very involved.
He loves snowboarding.
Oh, yeah?
He's a C.U. student, right?
You used to snowboard?
Yeah, brother.
Me too.
Snowboarding's good stuff,
isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're looking good. You got
a nice little bear there, dude.
That's chill, huh?
It's hard for him right now.
He's just had some surgery,
but he's gonna get a lot better.
Nice, man.
You come see him in a year.
You stay positive, all right?
Keep working hard,
and you'll get better.
No.
Right.
Wow.
It's been two years.
So let's go over this.
The M.R.I... Right here...
Do you see this black dot right here?
Oh, yeah.
This is an area...
that has left a scar
in that part of the brain.
This affects your vision. It
affects the left side of your body...
and your coordination
and your balance,
but also that's why you feel
so forgetful.
That's why you notice
your memory is impaired.
How much will those go away?
I don't believe the scars
are ever going to go away.
You still want to snowboard.
Yeah, I still want to snowboard.
I want that feeling back.
Medically and neurologically,
you cannot afford...
to hit your head.
It's interesting because
I feel like I know so well...
what I should be doing
and what I shouldn't be doing.
You do. And to know it
and think it is one thing.
To be in the moment and
disconnect thought and action...
that's a vulnerable area
for your type of brain injury.
And you take risks.
You live on the edge.
And that's where
the high risks come.
If somebody gets a concussion,
they're six times more likely
to get another concussion.
And the reason is just because a person
has some impairment in their abilities,
and their lifestyle's not made any
adjustments for that, and accidents happen.
Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate
everything that people do for me...
and all the support I have and all
the help I've gotten from doctors,
but it comes to the point where
I'm just ready to release from it all.
Just get me out of here.
Enough's enough.
And I feel like I'm coming
to that point. And I feel like...
I'm looking at you.
What your family's been through.
This is what you think about. You
use your intelligence and your love...
to make good decisions.
It doesn't come without injury.
I'm 24 years old right now, and
I've broken, you know, 23 bones.
♪ ♪ You've fallen once
You'll fall again ♪
A couple years ago I broke
my back and shattered my pelvis.

And I fell from like 45 feet.
I completely blacked out halfway down.
I woke up in the ambulance, and they
were like, "Jason, can you hear me? Jason!"
And I was just like,
"My name's Mason!"
I fell 30 feet
into a sitting position.
And then my hips
kind of shifted like this.
The worst crash I've ever had would
probably be when I ruptured my spleen.
I fell off the rail and landed
pretty much directly on my chest.
Travis doesn't clear it.
Watch. Takes it to the gut,

I mean, for me, I've had
maybe nine concussions.
I've had plenty of crashes
where I've cracked helmets open.
I would have been dead
if it wasn't for my helmet.
So there's a wire
inside my head,
'cause I'm on six head injuries.

I mean, what I've been telling
myself ever since Kev got hurt...
was that shit happens.
There's just no apparent
reason sometimes for it.
Well, we're here because we really want
to talk seriously together as a family...
about the fact that Kevin feels like he's
really ready to start snowboarding again.
I'll never forget
when we got to the hospital.
It was the one time
I kind of broke down...
and felt sort of a deep sense of
responsibility for what had happened.
Because the pressure, once
you get into it at that level,
it's very hard to get out of it.
I mean, you get caught up in it.
And then there's the expectation,
and then there's all the sponsors.
And everybody's expecting and wanting you
to do better and better and more and more.
And so you push the limits,
and the only way to be successful
in that sport is to push the limit.
Everybody's having bad falls,
and it's just luck whether you have
what happened to Kevin or you don't.
So I think we should have a
conversation with Kevin here.
Yeah. I think we'll all have
our own feelings about it.
I do think if Kevin hears
our feelings...
more than our advice...
But I do think he cares
about how we feel,
'cause he knows how much
we've been through with him.
And how much
we love him. Exactly.
So I think if we can focus on our feelings,
that probably would be the best thing.
Look at who is here.
Look at the new glasses.
How they feeling? They're
good. They're really good.
Are they?
Wow. It is a family dinner.
Thanksgiving. Yeah. Our first
Thanksgiving dinner of the year.
Thank you, guys.
Welcome back, K.P.
Wow. Welcome back, Kev.
Back from the dead.
I think the conversation
needs to start with...
what your plans are
about riding on snow.
I feel 100% confident.
Not you?
Calling a spade a spade,
isn't it, David?
I don't want to
die either, Dave.
I don't want you...
I...
That's not what I want.
I think those are all things...
that I could have happen
if I fall,
if I hit my head
really bad again.
It is pretty scary.
You don't want me to? No.
But that's the bottom line, and
that's what it comes down to...
is I'm going to snowboard again.
But I have to do it
so I don't get paralyzed...
and so I don't die
and I don't get hurt.
I think you see what has
happened to some other people...
who have had
more than one T.B.I.,
and I think...
I was so surprised at Craig...
when they told me they do see people
with a second one and a third one.
I was like... I think I just never...
I thought if somebody had one,
why... how could they ever put themselves in
a situation where they might have another one?
It's really hard
for you guys to know,
and, I mean,
it's unexplainable...
to say the amount that snowboarding
does for me and the amount I love it,
and just the feeling it gives
me to get to be on a snowboard,
and I just feel like no one else in this
room has that feeling about anything.
Maybe Dad does
about blowing glass, but...
it's so different than blowing
glass, 'cause it's just...
It... You know what it feels like to
me, Kev? It feels like an addiction.
I mean, if I was
smoking every day,
you wouldn't feel good about me.
And if I said, "Well, I'll cut it
back to one cigarette a day,"
and then it would be
two cigarettes a day,
and it goes... you know, you...
And when can you realize
that you're clumsier?
And for me it's hard, because
I don't see your awareness.
See, and then that gets
right back to my point...
that you guys
just have no faith.
Where this is coming from is
that the more you had to deal with,
the worse your tremors got.
And when we jumped in,
or Mummy jumped in...
and made you rest more and
take it easy and get more help,
the tremors started to get less.
So it was... it was... We let you
go as far as we felt was really safe,
'cause the tremors are not good.
You know, after I got...
After I broke my back,
I can't do a lot of the tricks
I... that made it as fun for me.
So, snowboarding
isn't as fun as it was.
There's also the scenario I
just sent these guys a video of...
it's a guy that had one...
he's a dirt biker...
He was like,
"No way I'm gonna stop."
He had a second. Second time,
"Not a chance I'm gonna stop."
Third time, got another one.
He's forced to retire. He said, "I
guess I have to say I'm gonna retire."
But he can't... He's paralyzed.
He can't even say his name.
Yeah. He can hardly talk.
How many professional
football players...
that have had a traumatic brain
injury go back and win the Super Bowl?
How many is it?
None. Never happened.
My sense about you is you just
want to do what you want to do,
and you have a lot
of confidence in yourself,
but I think we're all talking about
this 'cause we love you so much.

Nope. Didn't make it.
When you blew it up, you

There's no thickness left.
It's like paper in the bottom.
In school I was like a failure,
and at home I was a success.
School was really hard, but
my parents just believed in us,
and my father never opened
a report card.
My philosophy was exactly
the same as my father's.
He really believed in the child's
ability to know its boundaries.
But after the accident,
I felt very responsible.
There's all the money involved
and all the sponsorships.
It wasn't just Kevin.
There should be limits, I think,
just like there is in car racing.
And finally they had to limit the
size of the engines in the racing cars...
because people were
killing themselves.
And it's the same
in the half-pipe.
If you make the walls higher, which makes
it more dramatic for the spectators...
and the television and the
media, the athlete will go.
I mean, he'll push it
to the limits.
It's in the athlete's makeup.
I felt that, at some level,

Is that three-inch?
Yep.
All right. Cool. I got

For both snowboard and helmet.
Yeah, and Burton gets one too.

Two and a half years later, hearing
that your memory is at a four percent,
I'm not even close.
The worst about me now
is kind of my filter...
and how I come across in such a bad
way when I'm really not meaning to...
be mean or negative.
You know, I really want to be
happy, and I want to be positive,
and I feel like there's times that,
you know, it comes across that I'm not,
and I just really hate that.
My double vision is so bad.
I'll go running
on the trails out back,
and I will start
running into stuff.
And I can't, like, see where
these different trees are.
I just feel like,
whether it's the NFL, skiing,
snowboarding, skateboarding,
just like all these different sports,
people are hitting their heads, and
they're having serious repercussions.
Now to champion
freestyle skier Sarah Burke.
She is in critical condition right now
after an accident on a training run...
left her with
a traumatic brain injury.
It happened
on the exact same course...
where snowboarder Kevin Pearce
suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2009.
This morning, Sarah
Burke is in critical condition...
with her husband, Rory Bushfield,
also a freeskier, by her side.
The very hardest part...
Well, I guess, of all the...
was just getting the news.
Just was like... I just
did not want to believe it.
You know, I turned on my phone,
and I had a bunch of missed calls...
and a bunch of text... like,
"Call me now." "Call me now."
And it's all, like, the
people that are with Sarah.
I'm just like,
"No, no, no, no, no."
And I call, you know.
Felt like smashing
my cell phone, you know.
And then I just... I just went
as quick as I could down there.
She was doing an alley-oop
flat spin 540.
It's one of the most beautiful tricks
you can do in the half-pipe really.
I can't do it.
It's like a super-hard trick.
She had it dialed.
She'd done lots.
She was skiing really well,
landed one perfectly just before.
Like, hiked up and went and
then did another one and just,
I think... I think she just maybe
pushed off the wall a little too much,
and super unlucky crash.
I talked to her mom
when they were in the hospital,
and I knew it was
really, really serious.
Same half-pipe, same place.
I know. And then I was like,
"Why?" you know.
"Why would it turn out
the way it does?"
Common sense tells you
that there's real risk here.
When the sport first started,
those courses that they were on,
the top of those was only
six to eight feet high.
Now it's 22 feet high. So you
could be falling as many as 40 feet.
If you're falling that far, you could
reach speeds of 30 miles an hour.
Now, recreational helmets will
protect you up to about 17 miles an hour,
but as we saw with Kevin
Pearce, he just went snowboarding.
Yeah, Kevin gives us great hope.
Just saw him recently.
And... To have him back. And
as Sarah's husband, Rory, said,
she is gonna fight to recover.
We had a lot of hope.
It was like... It was
a really slow process.
And we had... Yeah, we were,
like, all 100% sure, you know,
she would come through.
Like, it's Sarah, you know.
Just so tough.
Yeah. And... Oh.
The doctors coming in.
Just the bearers
of bad news, you know.
You could tell... I could tell
right when the doctor walked in.
That day he told us,
I knew... I was like,
"Yeah, that guy is not
telling us good news."
You know.
He didn't have
to talk me. I knew.
It was like
as soon as he walked in.
It was hard to hear
those words. So hard.
Sarah Burke, a champion
freestyle skier...
who's been seen
as an early favorite...
for a possible gold medal
in the next Winter Olympics,
has died tonight, nine days
after a training accident.
Snowboarder Kevin Pearce
suffered a traumatic brain injury...
on the same course in 2009.
There's nothing mellow about
the sports that we're doing...
and kind of the tricks
we're doing.
Burke's family
is said to be grateful...
for the support
and messages honoring her.
They are also dealing with the
medical bills from the Utah hospital.
Initial estimates put the cost of her
care at more than half a million dollars.
Many have questioned why
Burke wasn't covered by insurance.
The Freestyle
Skiing Association says...
its coverage only applies
to sanctioned competitions.
But when she was injured, Burke
was participating in an event...
for one of her sponsors,
Monster Energy drinks.
Despite those concerns, this
morning, one thing is clear:
No one is questioning
the legacy of Sarah Burke.
And speaking of that legacy,
thanks largely to Burke's efforts,
freestyle skiing will be
an Olympic sport in 2014.

I just feel bad. I mean,
you get in a scenario...
where you see
something unfortunate.
It really shocks the community, and it puts
this weird, strange light on the sport...
where people are questioning
the safety of the sport.
But you don't have to do what
I'm doing to go have a good time.
I don't sometimes like
what I'm doing.
I do it because I need the
satisfaction and the fulfillment...
to make me feel better
about myself,
like I've achieved some new
level that I never dreamed of.

A perfect 100!
The first time ever!
So I've been doing
these scans for a long time,
and as I watch ESPN,
you see the highlights, and then
you see who got arrested that day.
And it's totally connected
to brain trauma.
Your brain's involved
in everything you do.
I mean, when you hurt it, it hurts
your ability to do everything in your life,
especially control
your impulses.
Did I show you
some of my NFL brains?
So these are running backs.
So look at this guy.
So your brain looks
so much better...
than this guy.
Last time you said you can
be a little bit irritable with others.
- How is that?
- Still irritable with others.
But I always have been for
the last two and a half years,
so it's nothing new.
Is it different
than before the injury?
You would say so. I wasn't as irritable,
was I? I would say it's different.
Do you start getting down
on yourself...
and start getting into sort
of negative thought patterns?
I was just thinking, like,
not that I'm a failure,
just, like...
just, like, that I can do
something so stupid so often.
So, whenever you get
the thought "I'm an idiot,"
you globalize it, and it totally
trashes your self-esteem.
Our goal is to get you to
the best place you can be.
It'll only happen if you
have disciplined thoughts.
Mm-hmm.
Oh!
Yeah!
I'll do a little exercise with you.
Okay, Trevor, touch your elbow.
Where's your elbow?
Can you touch it
on your other side?
Point to just your elbow.
Elbow?
Yeah. Just your elbow.
This one?
Okay.
So, there are certain things
that are a little off.
For instance, the other day,
Trevor and Peyton,
who is Trevor's
12-year-old brother...
they all went golfing.
And they got a golf cart, because, of
course, Trevor has a hard time walking,
and all of a sudden, snap,
no control of impulses,
and Trevor ran Peyton over
on the golf course.
- Directly over?
- He knocked... So, here's Peyton. Here's the golf cart.
Ran... Whipped him down and
ran... The entire golf cart was over...
And the craziest was is that
Trevor's facial expression...
was just like, "Yeah. Yeah."
- Just like, it was pretty funny?
- Yeah.
It was classic, just running
over your brother in a golf cart.
Just like cruising
right over him.
Yep.
Yeah.
These brain injuries are
pretty crazy in a sense that...
See, Kevin... Like,
it's totally, totally...
invisible.
Exactly. It is invisible.
Completely.
And the sad thing is is...
I watched that day you went back and
snowboarded again, and I wasn't smiling.
I was crying, because this
second injury has not been fun.
Kevin, you had a great life before,
but you're given a totally different brain.
And so you can't go back
to who you were before.
You have to go
with what you have now.
And part of being here, for me,
is for you to be able to hear
what Tammie's talking about.
Right? 'Cause she has the experience...
and Trevor does too... that we don't have.
And, to this day, Trevor,
what do you want to do?
Snowboarding.
Yeah.
And where do you want to go?
Utah.
It has not been an easy thing,
because... Trevor, what
do you always tell me?
Shut up.
Yeah. I mean, he... When people
are around, he talks, he communicates.
But when it's just
Trevor and I...
You gotta be nicer to mom. No.
Come on! Why not?
I don't know. Mom's... No,
you should be nice to mom.
I know you're brain injured. I
know what it's like to be brain injured.
I'm brain injured.
Yep.
It sucks. But you can fix it. You
can change. You can work on it.
But being mean to them
is not helping. Nope.
And it's not funny.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not kidding with you. You
gotta help 'em out a little bit.
And I know snowboarding
is good, man.
Snowboarding was awesome
when we used to get to do it,
but, you know, life's changed,
and things are different now, and...
And it's the last thing that you ever
wanted was to have a brain injury.
Mm-hmm.
And you did not want to
screw this thing up like we did.
'Cause mine's screwed up
too, man, but you gotta love it,
you gotta realize that
things have changed now.
Yep.
You can change this.
You can get better.
You gotta work hard
and love them.
Shit's gonna get
better. Trust me. Yep.
You keep working,
we'll get better. All right.
You got a good life. You got a
good house. You got a good family.
You got it all, man.
Yep.
It's no easy road to go down
to try and get into that brain.
Right.
But I feel...
But I do think
he was listening to you.
I feel like it could
be worth it. Yeah.
I feel like I could change their lives, and
that's been something for me about this.
It's like this has changed my life, and I
can help now change other people's lives...
It's a good thing. Almost
could make it, you know...
Try and make it feel
like it's worth it. Right.
A wake-up call. It's just kind of
like waking up and realizing that,
you know, my life
has changed, you know,
that I am brain injured, and, you know,
that's kind of how things are gonna be.
And it's a whole
new life for me.
I used to be waking up
every morning...
in a new country going to
a big snowboard contest,
and now it's waking up every morning
and just being so happy to be here.
Kevin, I have a friend
who had a waterskiing accident,
and it left him with
a serious head injury,
but your story has inspired him.
And I just
want to say thank you.
Kevin, for sharing
your lessons learned,
for your spirit
to conquer adversity...
and for personal triumphs
small and large,
thank you from Passages,
presented to Kevin, October 10, 2012.
Thank you so much.
I used to win a lot of contests,
and I used to win a lot of
trophies, and, you know,
since this, I haven't
won any trophies, so...
I got the feeling back.
For so long, it's like
you have that false reality,
and it's like there's nothing telling
you that it just can't happen anymore,
and then, you know, it was really, I
think, when I first got on my snowboard...
and first tried doing things, it was like,
"All right. You don't have it anymore.
You've lost...
You've lost that."
A couple months
after the accident,
I remember so clearly
being like,
"Oh, I wonder if I'm gonna be
able to ride in the Olympics."
You know, I was in the hospital
there for another four months.
I was two years
away from snowboarding,
and I thought that I might be
going to the Olympics.
Like, I was so far gone, and, like,
now I don't know how far gone I still am.
David... he looks at pictures of
you from when you first got hurt,
that he has on his computer,
and he watches videos,
and I think he gets...
Dave, I want to be there for you
now, and I want you to be okay with it...
that I'm not gonna do
that stuff anymore.
You know, I understand
that I can't do double corks.
I've come to terms with the fact
that that's not gonna happen anymore.
So you should try as hard as
you can not to worry about that.
You know, I think the hardest
thing for me to come to accept,
and, you know, that I've been so
fortunate because I have accepted,
is how much my life
has changed...
and just how different things are now
and how different things will be forever.
So I'm curious, David,
when you're listening to Kevin
talk about that,
if you could learn something about
accepting your Down syndrome.
Dave, there are definitely
a lot of hard things in this.
There's definitely a lot of
things that aren't that good,
but we have a lot of good things, and we've
got a really good family here to help us...
and a really good
support system.
You know, I think that's the
biggest part is to understand...
that things are different,
but things are good,
and things are okay.
So, can you know that,
and will you understand...
that I am gonna be safe, and I'm
gonna be able to make the right decisions,
and you don't need to
worry about me?
Okay.
Let me ask you
this question, Dave.
Do you feel like you're happy right
now and things are going well for you?
What you said about him... about what he
said that he's not gonna do double corks.
That's making you feel
happier in your life?
Yeah. You know, I think that would
help... not to look at the pictures.
Have a picture of him
how he is now. Yeah.
That's what you want a picture
of. You don't need pictures...
of where I was
and remembering the old times.
You need pictures
of remembering now.
We are about to feast.
You have to cut it here.
This is my first carve.
Dave, happy Thanksgiving.
Kev is home.
