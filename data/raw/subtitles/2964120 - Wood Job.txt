Sorry!
So did you make it?
Sorry.
Yeah, so I failed this year.
Wait for me. I'll study for a year
and try the entrance exams again.
Maybe we should give each other
a little more space for a while.
Just do a make-up year!
I got in because I just applied
to easy universities.
There's lots of better girls
than Reina, right?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Go wild!
Go!
I'm going to major in dancing!
You? Dance?
Group dating!
Tennis and skiing.
That's the way to meet girls!
School clubs or dating parties?
Which works better?
Join the Self Defense Force!
Aw, shit!

What about the exam next year?
I don't want to spend next year
in a cram school.
But why forestry?
Why?
Well, you know...
...it's a man's work.
And it's green.
It's good for the planet.
Oh yeah?
I'll call you back.
Hello? It's me.
Hi.
Hello? You're breaking up.
I get off here. Hang on.
Huh? Hey!
I'm looking for a signal.
Hello? Hello?
Nothing!
Aw, come on!
Hello?
No Service
Give me a break!
To hell with this.
No more trains for six hours?!
Oh, no!
Hey, come on!
It's wrecked!
Shit! Shit!
Mr. Hirano?
Yes.
I'm from the 'Green' Cooperative.
Um...
Pit viper.
It's poisonous. Don't get bit.
You get three meals a day.
And your lodging.
Nothing to worry about.
Everyone's a beginner, just like you
You're all pretty much the same,
if I can put it that way
There'll be different instructors
every day.
Listen to them all,
and learn from them.
They're forestry workers,
so they talk a bit rough.
But don't let that bother you.
This is a one-year program.
Your first month is
basic training here.
Among you we have...
...people changing careers,
people right out of high school...
...former military,
lots of different people.
For the next 30 days
you will all be like teammates.
After that you'll be sent
to your different workplaces.
Any questions?
Um...
...where's the woman in this picture?
Look down here!
Come work in the woods with me!
Illustrative purposes only
Let's see... 'thinning',
if that's how it's written.
Is that right? OK...
Why do we thin forests
every so often?
Let's see... Hirano?
Huh?
Uh... I don't know.
All right.
Periodic thinning
leaves the good trees.
Better sunlight results in improved
ring formation and trunk thickness.
Very good! Have you studied this?
I majored in Forestry.
Do you mind? There's more.
Go ahead.
Leaving the forest without thinning
worsens the soil.
Run-off and weaker roots
thus encourage landslides.
Securing of safety ropes.
If you need to secure yourself
in a tree with only one hand...
...then you do...
...this...
...and this.
That's called the bowline knot.
Try it.
Just once around.
You, too. Just pass it once.
Very good!
Thank you, sir.
Is that some kind of voodoo doll?
Chainsaws are dangerous.
Always wear these chaps
when you use one.
If you would...
First, you make a face cut
in the direction you want it to fall.
Now comes the backcut.
Leave the middle part as a hinge...
...and drive in a wedge like this.
The trunk pivots on that hinge
and falls in the opposite direction.
Timber!
We don't say that any more.
You don't?
Now to the danger of kickback,
on page 8.
When the chain is coming round
and changing direction...
...the rotation can make it
bounce back towards the operator.
This is called 'kickback'.
Do you have any wet wipes?
No.
Or deodorant?
No, I don't.
You!
What are you doing?
Ow!
Respect the forest, or it'll kill you!
Sorry.
Come out here and see kickback!
I'll show you!
I'll get a band-aid.
What do you do when that happens?
You've learned that.
Uh...
Direct pressure. Push downward
on the wound, and elevate it.
Isle of Yew
OK?
The guy's anemic!
Sorry!
Hang onto it.
All that for a scratch?
What a wimp!
You OK?
Here...
What?
Your finger?
Hello?
It's me.
What's the matter?
It's Yuki.
Nothing's the matter.
I just wondered how you were.
Oh, same as always.
You're going to laugh, though.
Your dad threw out his back again.
It's no big deal, I told you!
Get the stew! It's boiling over!
Are you OK?
Careful!
Oh, no!
'I'm not cut out for this.
'Mentally...
'...or physically.
'I just can't do this.'
I'm not cut out for this.
I can't do it.
Weil, if you really want to quit,
there's nothing else to say.
I'm sorry.
Take care.
Can you go a little easier on them?
They're all going to quit.
The woods are no place
for a big-city wimp!
Don't be like that.
We don't want them
to leave after a year.
We want them to stay,
to live here, and raise a family.
That won't happen.
Right?
I'll be on my way.
This is all of them?
All of this year's.
I'll toss them.
Don't use this picture ever again.
I said I'd just do it once.
Hey!
It's cold out there. Take this.
Wait! Take me with you!
Thanks a...
If this is why you came,
then I'm glad you're leaving.
We get a lot of posers like you.
They take the course,
then quit after a week of real work.
That's the real problem.
Nakamura Lumber Co.
Good morning.
Let's all do our best again,
and have a safe day.
Fujishima Kazumasa.
Congratulations.
Mirano Yuki.
Congratulations.
Hirano...
You hung in there.
To tell the truth,
I thought you'd be the first to quit.
See you in the woods.
Yamamoto, you hung in there.
To tell the truth...
You have a ride?
Uh, yeah.
Where are you working?
Nakamura Lumber.
You mean that Nakamura?
In Kamusari?
Where?
It's way, way up in the mountains.
You really picked a tough place
to start wording.
Hirano! Is Yuki Hirano here?!
He's calling you.
Here.
Deer Crossing
Doer, huh?
Come on.
We're taking it?
Yuck!
It's sticky!
Quiet!
Are we going to a vet?
No, thanks.
Iida
Hey, Gran.
Who's this?
This young lad.
He's the trainee forester.
We'll have him for a year.
What?!
Is that true?
You got a problem?
No. It's just that it's only
335 days now.
The boss lives over there.
Go say hello.
Gotta hurry!
Yeah, I'll go say hello.
Be right back!
Um...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
I said no and I mean no!
Oh, hi.
You're Hirano?
Yes.
Ah, you're here...
How do you do?
You just got here?
Have you seen the village yet?
No.
Stop that!
Santa!
Smarten up
or I'll feed you full of bugs!
We're clearing old cedars
away from the forest road.
Are you coming?
He just got here!
So what?
Sure!
Yoki!
There.
Be careful!
That's a real mess.
You OK down there?
Come and help!
No, over there!
Move!
Just let him go.
Let's get this done today!
This is Hirano, a Green-Trainee.
He'll be with us for a year.
How do you do.
My name is...
Huh?! What the...?!
Excuse me.
Leeches.
What?! Hey!
Don't be shy.
Don't pull them! You'll bleed!
So now what?!
Heat. Get a lighter.
Hey, wait!
Ow!
Let me get this one in front.
I'll get that one, thanks!
Stand still!
Is she mad again?
She's always like that.
Leave me alone.
Again?
It's that New York girl.
He'll never learn.
So Miki found out
and last night you had a real battle.
Noo troockin' nu thee domp.
Sorry?
'Er bay vakes.
Huh?
Sae it gaes.
Would you know this girl
at Nakamura Lum...
Huh?
'We cut down the trees
and we drink our dinner down
'Dine to our hearts' content
'And snore
'Like a cow...'
I had to hurry to get back
and bleed it.
Great!
This is that deer from the road,
isn't it.
That's what it gets
for chewing on our trees!
Don't eat it
if you don't want to!
Let's have a drink!
I'm under-age...
It'll perk up your seeds.
Eat up.
Don't give it all away.
There's lots here.
Give him yours, then,
it your seeds are so perky.
Are you still mad?
I said I was sorry!
Are you serious about this?
Do you want a baby or not?!
Who said I didn't?
I give up!
Ovulation Chart
I'll be excused, then.
Agh, these teeth!
My false teeth don't fit right.
Damn these teeth!
They just don't fit right.
What am I doing here?
Hello?
Hello?
Is there a bus stop near here?
It's the leech guy!
Good morning.
We have a lost item.
That's my mom!
Coming!
Damn it!
Excuse me,
is there a bus stop around here?
My hearing's getting really bad.
He wants to take a bus.
There's one, uh, you know...
The roundabout by the supermarket.
Oh, that's right!
It's just down the road.
Right by the supermarket.
Really? Can you walk it?
Into town?
We always go by car.
But you're young.
You can do it.
Off you go.
How far is it by car?
About two hours.
It's not far.
No, it's not.
What are you doing here?
He says he wants to go to town.
Oh yeah?
Why?
Uh...
Oh... to got this fixed.
Why? Out here there's no...
Wait! Perfect timing!
We're going shopping. Climb in.
I didn't lock the house.
No one locks their house here.
So it goes.
I wanna come!
Loveland Motel
Say 'bye-bye'.
I'll take him to the phone place.
See you soon.
Here we are.
Fill out this form,
and we'll call you when it's done.
Wait here.
And no running away.
'Club New York'
That 'New York' girl...
- Already?
- I'm hungry.
It's better cold.
This is fine.
Try it.
Go on!
Naoki!
Naoki!
Trees... you gotta love 'em.
Who's she?
Naoki, Yuko's sister.
What?!
Oh, really?
She doesn't work for Nakamura?
No.
Why?
Hey...
You mean this?
Get serious! No!
She's divorced.
She is not!
So which is it?
She fell in love with a trainee
from the city, a guy like you.
They moved in together there.
Everyone expected them
to get married...
...but suddenly, he left
and it was all over.
It was big news in the village.
Why? They just broke up,
that's all.
Maybe that's how it is in the city,
but not out here.
He was a good worker,
and a decent guy.
What happened?
Well, men and women...
things happen
Don't they.
Now it's like
she's past her sell-by date.
Once you're past the age,
it's a crime here to be single.
Ow!
The guy's in that picture, too.
There.
It was his idea to use Naoki
for the recruiting picture.
It hurts to see how happy she was.
What's the use of bringing in
all these city wimps all the time!
Don't lie there all day!
How much do we have to plants?
This whole mountain.
What?!
How much land is that?
About 2,000 square meters.
8 or 9 hundred seedlings.
All by hand?!
How else would you do it?
Help!
You handle it!
Not yet!
Have you eaten already?
Getting used to it?
Sort of.
Think you'll stay in the job?
I'm still thinking about it.
A year goes by pretty quick.
258 days to go.
Yeah?
Black?
Looks like today's Yoki's day!
For eel?
Snake. It perks up your seeds.
Thanks!
Good night!
I forgot! Gran's going
to a hot spring tonight!
Thanks for the car!
Your Senior's sticker!
We'll see you!
The truck's still being fixed, right?
Yuki, could you do us a favor?
What?
Stay somewhere else tonight.
Today's the day.
But where?
What, you want to watch?
Go hit on Naoki. Speed things up.
It's not like that!
Take these.
Oh, come on!
What?
Uh, nothing...
They're just, uh...
Let's get going.
You have a girl?
The guy with leeches in his pants.
The guy with leeches in his pants.
Here.
Wait a minute...
Come on.
Here we are!
Sensei!
Bring it here!
OK! Don't pull!
Hey? Look who's here!
The guy with leeches in his...
Pump it more!
Me, too?
You won't beat me!
This isn't fair!
There's Leech!
You play, too!
Come on, Leech!
Leech! Leech!
Don't call me that!
Go, Sensei!
Go, Leech!
Go! Go!
I hear there's a new trainee
in the village.
He hasn't come to see me.
Does that mean something?
No! I'm sorry.
Yuki!
Yuki, come here!
OK, kids. It's time to go home.
Grandpa!
This is Yuki Hirano
He's working for us this year.
Mr. Yamane, the Council Head.
How's it going?
An old maid...
...and a kid with no manners.
Kenji! We're going.
It takes all kinds, I guess.
Stupid!
You're too big for that!
You'll break my back!
What brings you here?
Uh...
Oh, right! Can I stay
at your place tonight?
Watch me!
Watch you do what?
And what's this?
The Boss...
Iwao, Saburo...
And Yoki.
What are these?
Nameplates for the men
in the Mountain Goddess Festival.
'Mountain Goddess'?
Santa! Aren't you in bed yet?
I want to sleep with Leech.
That's enough!
Say good night
Good night.
'Night.
Are you here in your underpants?
Good night!
'Night.
A computer, here?
Of course.
These are our woods?
Yep.
We survey it with GPS.
The 'Geographic Information System'
gives us a forest management map.
We used to have to walk it all
and draw marks on the map.
Are you listening?
Sorry.
Excuse him. When he starts talking
about trees, he's lost to the world.
Why are you dressed like this?
That's my great grandfather.
He looks just like him,
doesn't he.
Let's see...
This was 105 years ago,
back in the Meiji Era.
Meiji?
So their seedlings...
Are the trees we'll be cutting now.
Do you want to do one?
That's big for that age.
They put it in good soil.
It should go down that way.
Hey!
What?
Aren't I cutting that one?
Stupid! We're not letting you cut
a 105 year-old tree!
That one's in the way.
You take it down.
Get to work!
Clear above
Fall path clear.
Retreat path clear.
Which way's it falling?
This way.
Yeah.
Pay attention!
Don't get a big head!
Those are ours.
Fewer knots than the others...
...and rings as even
as they'd be on a record.
That's what you get from 105 years
of proper trimming and thinning.
It's Nakamura.
Those are good trees!
That's a nice grain.
Very nice!
Nakamura's next!
Here we go!
¥160,000!
¥300,000!
¥310,000!
Too high.
Yeah, I give up.
¥340,000.
¥350,000.
¥360,000.
It'll go higher.
¥800,000 for one log!
So counting all of them...
Clear the mountain
and you'd be millionaires!
Maybe so.
Why are you driving this?
You could have a Mercedes!
Are you stupid?
It's not just your lifetime, you know.
It's not?
What's left for the next generations
if we sell all our ancestors' trees?
What'll our kids do then?
We keep planting seedlings
and nursing them along.
It's strange business.
A farmer knows every fall
if his crop's any good.
But not us.
When the time comes
to judge our work...
...we'll all be dead.
So it goes.
Hello.
I'm all out of breath!
Hello!
Hello.
Can you run me an errand?
An errand?
This.
I'll give you lunch.
How high are we going?
Stupid!
Don't look down I said!
The seeds are all way up there!
Hey!
Guys!
It's just about lunch time.
Put a rope on mine, will you?
You'll eat up here?
Sure! I'm not climbing
back up here again.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Don't tell me...
I'm telling you.
You stupid bugger!
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I feel the same way.
You do, huh? Smarten up!
How can I work without food?!
No excuses!
Thanks a lot!
You tell her thanks, too.
She saved your life!
Stupid!
Wait!
Look.
So this was lunch?
Naoki's
He'll be fine.
He was raised by wolves.
Here.
'Isle of Yew'
It's not dirty.
Thanks.
I'll wash it.
That's OK.
No.
It's fine!
There.
I'll wash it.
Why did you break up with
your old boyfriend?
No service on his cell phone.
The toilets stank.
No trains!
No bus!
No convenience store!
Then why not just move into town?
It's not that simple.
Why not?
We've always lived here.
So what?
I guess I was wrong.
You are from the city.
What do you mean?
You'll never understand.
I don't know how to take that.
Say what you mean.
You'll leave the village, too.
Don't get everyone's hopes up.
What?
I'm saying if you're going to leave,
hurry up and do it!
Ow!
Well? Did you get to first base?
Your cell phone is ready.
Check and see if it's working.
Aren't you going to 'New York'?
Aw, shuddup.
One call Reina
Voicemail
Hi, it's Reina.
How's the wood job going?
I have a favor to ask.
These are the people from the...
...'Slow Life'...
...Research Group.
For a few days we'd like to observe
village life and forestry work.
How do you do.
Do you have places to stay?
We've got hotel rooms in town.
So you're rich.
Hwa bae thee 'slay leaf'?
Sorry?
What's 'Slow Life', he means.
A slow life, I guess.
Like Gran Shige, the way she walks.
It's all on our home page.
Wha'ar bay tha?
'Iz ame, methink.
Possin' fehr bay may.
Let's just get going, OK?
You've filled out a lot
in these few month?
I have?
Don't take that!
That's great!
Stop it!
This is wild!
You'll cut yourself!
Could we take a picture?
Sure.
There's a good shot over here.
Hey, that's great!
Don't you say 'timber!'?
No!
Never!
They don't cut them down
with axes?
Like 'I'm a lumberjack... kchunk!'
No, no!
That's like...
'Never!'
That's hilarious!
You eat those?!
Hornet larvae.
What?!
When Reina said a high-school friend
had suddenly gone into forestry...
...way out in the country...
...I wondered what we'd find.
So it goes.
It's amazing where people
can manage to live.
I couldn't do it.
You have to stay a year, right?
When do you get out?
This isn't a jail!
But without these people,
we wouldn't have houses.
It makes me want to bow...
...and say 'thank you!'
No!
What are you doing?!
Go away.
Yuki!
Go away!
'We cut down the trees
and we drink our dinner down
'Dine to our hearts' content
'And snore
'Like a cow...'
'Sing in time, A B C D E.'
'Sing in time, A B C D E.'
'I want to draw, A B C D E.'
'I want to draw, A B C D E.'
It's snowing!
Hey!
Tonight's the festival meeting!
Let's call it a day!
Festival?
Why?
You come, too.
Let's get packed up!
That's cold!
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.
We were just talking about
Mr. Nakamura's trainee.
What was your name?
Hirano.
Well, Hirano...
...we're wondering about whether
someone from outside...
...should really take part.
I don't mind if I don't...
Ow!
Hold on here!
Yes, Yuki's a trainee,
but he's one of us.
Nothing says he can't join in.
Mr. Nakamura...
...I understand
where you're coming from.
But this next time is
the 48th year Great Festival.
I'm not sure if...
...beginner should be in
something that important.
What if he brings the curse
of the Mountain Goddess down on us?
A 'curse'?
Yeah, that's possible.
The Nakamuras are the chief celebrants
and he'll be there as a Nakamura man.
He's got to be committed to becoming
a real mountain man.
He'll probably leave the village
after his year.
Right?
He can't trim worth a damn.
He's slow at planting
and he can't fell...
...or run equipment.
He's not much use...
...but he's a real mountain man.
There!
Ow!
Why are we taking a nice day off?
Going into the woods today is taboo.
Why not?
Today the Goddess counts her trees.
Not that again!
Go  into the woods today
and you got counted among the trees.
People vanish that way.
Yeah, right!
So what happens to them?
You've never heard it
when you're cutting a tree?
'Ow! It hurts!'
And when, you look down
at your chain-saw...
Damn it!
Stupid!
What are you doing?!
Don't play with fire, I said!
Why not? I'm here.
And what if they start a forest fire?!
Relax!
Yeah!
I said not to!
You'll never get married
if you act like that.
Yeah!
That's what Yoki said.
I did not!
My grandpa says so!
You made her mad.
Go say you're sorry.
OK!
Why do we have to say sorry
for telling the truth?
Sensei, wait!
A jewel beetle!
I bet that's what it is!
No more playing with fire.
Yuki, wake up!
Wake up!
Kenji Yamane has been lost
since lunchtime today.
If you see him,
please call Nakamura Lumber.
It's my fault!
That doesn't matter. Let's find him.
He can't have gone far yet.
Where's Mr. Yamane?
They're all at the next village
meeting about the Festival.
They're coming back now.
The poor boy!
If he's been spirited away,
they'll never find him.
I'm going, too!
No!
You have to watch the kids!
Don't worry...
Leave it to me. I'll find him.
Here we go!
Where are you?!
Kenji!
Answer us!
What's this? Fog?
The Goddess is telling us
to stay out.
Naoki? Is that you?
Hey!
Kenji!
I've found him!
Hey!
How did we get way up here'?
Carry me.
How can you fall asleep now?
It's getting a bit dark.
Where did Yuki get to?
Hey! He's got him!
Is he hurt?!
He's just sleeping.
Kenji! Where did you get to?!
I'm hungry.
You had me worried sick!
Sorry.
Kids are really heavy!
My arm's gone numb.
Hey!
What's that hanging on your ear?
A viper!
Naoki... goodbye.
Perfect timing!
The ambulance is right here.
Get the ambulance!
Come on! Don't pass out!
We'll come back.
Wish him our best.
Thank you for coming.
I told them you were asleep.
Thanks.
They asked me to give you this.
So...
You're in.
It's the Greet Festival this year,
so everyone's all worked up.
Yoki and the Boss are happy.
Make sure you do your part.
Then you'll be a real mountain man.
'My part'?
Oh, right...
There's someone else here.
Should I send her away, too?
So Kenji said he met
a beautiful woman in the forest?
No one knows what really happened.
But it's strange.
Hey! It's not funny!
Sorry!
I wish this would heal up.
So...
...how long now?
What?
Your year.
Yeah, how many days?
Stupid! It's 16 days.
Oh, yeah.
That's all?
Hirano Yuki
Over here!
Stop it!
Don't!
Stop it!
More sweet saké. And pepper.
Sweet saké?
Here!
Stop admiring yourself.
Ow!
This decides
if you're a mountain man or not.
What do we do
after we climb the mountain?
Did thy ghost maid no tell ye?
No! No one will tell me!
Wait and see.
Can't we use hot water?
Just do it!
It's the leech!
Stop that!
Hirano!
Hey! How are you!
You've stuck it out?
Hang on.
Yamamoto! Naito!
What's that?
You'll see.
Let's go!
Don't forget this.
Hurry up!
Ow! What's that?!
Yuki?
Yuki?
Excuse me.
Yuki!
Yuki Hirano!
Yes?
Your mother's on the phone.
She said it was important.
Something about your father!
Dad?!
Go on ahead. I'll catch up!
Just make sure you get up there
before sunrise.
Don't be late!
Late for what?
It's me! What's wrong?
Yuki?
You finish next week, don't you?
And your father says to make
that minced steak you like.
What?!
Did you prefer it with ketchup
or with gravy?
Is that all you called for?
I thought Dad was dead!
Excuse me...
Not that way, buddy.
I'll never make it!
Well? Are you going or not?
Well?!
I'll never get there by sunrise!
Something's rubbing.
I can't help it!
All I've got on is this sash!
What's that kid doing?
He'll never make it!
Sorry!
You've got your nerve.
Right. Women wait down below.
Right!
Now it begins.
What begins?
And this sash
is riding up on me.
Sorry.
Up here.
'I tremble in awe to speak
'O Great Goddess of the Mountain
'O Great Goddess
'Before the Great Goddess of the Trees
'We speak in reverence
'On this first Great Festival
in 48 years
'The mountain men of Kamusari
gather before you.
'We speak not for ourselves
'May your spirit flow
in smooth tranquility...
'...for evermore.
'This we most humbly ask.'
It's looking good!
Yuki!
Me?
Hey!
Go!
That's one big woodie!
Once it's on the ramp,
the ladies are waiting!
Come on!
May our children prosper!
May our crops grow!
Go!
It's huge!
Wow!
Here it comes!
Get back!
Somebody stop it!
Hold the tree!
We can't!
Climb on it!
Are you serious?!
Higher! Get on top of it!
A bowline! Tie yourself on!
I did it!
I'm dead!
What's' that?
Someone's riding it!
That's Yuki!
What's that fool doing?!
Are we OK?
No!
Hero it comes!
I'm alive!
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!
Let me through!
Your blessing be upon me!
You get in there, too.
Naoki!
Naoki!
Go on!
Naoki!
Thank you for everything.
I'll keep this for you.
Take this.
Yuki's going away.
Bye-bye.
Sorry.
That's OK.
Here's a lunch.
There's no snake in it.
Are you crying?
Ow!
Naoki didn't make it.
She said she'd come
when she tidied up after school.
'Bye, now.
Take care.
Look after yourself.
OK. OK!
Isle of Yew
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Why is that kid so late?!
What can he be doing?
I guess I'll tidy up.
What?
What's wrong?
What's that?
What?
A snake?
