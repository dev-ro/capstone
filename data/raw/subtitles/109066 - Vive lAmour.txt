You like stealing other people's keys?

It's definitely for life.
This is for couples.
Correct, it's very large.
It's for a husband and wife.
Once a couple bought one.
They brought their friends here to buy one.
I asked,
"Why did you bring your friends here?"
They said it's a fun to play
Mahjong with neighbors.
All you have to do is knock.
Family size is over there.
Thank you.
3,000 copies.
Got it.
Hey.
Sir, buy one for your girlfriend?
What are you doing here?
Couldn't sleep so I came out for a stroll.
Have a look and see anything you like.

If you like,
you may have it with cheaper price.
Hot sauce?
Just a little bit.
Together?
O.K.
