Yuri!
Yuri, come on!
Ah!
Yuri!
You're not going anywhere!
Going somewhere?
This wasn't the deal.
Ray was supposed
to be here in person!
I'm sorry,
I thought I made myself clear.
We represent Ray's interests.
Now, uh... key, please.
Ah, Yuri.
Ah!
No!
Didn't have to be that way.
Here.
Holy fuck!
If... if you kill me,
you're never going
to get what you want.
You want to make a deal
with Ray face to face?
Here's is your chance.
Hey, Tommy.
I got a whole box of them
in the car for you.
Come on! Yeah!
Oh, yeah! Come on!
Hey!
Oh!
Whoo!
How you doing? All right.
- Hey, Ray.
- How you doin', Bobby?
I thought you quit.
- I thought you quit.
- I did.
Back on the floor.
I got it from here.
Okay, Ray.
- You can't make me talk.
- We'll see about that.
What do you two
think you're doing?
I'm doing what you said.
What the fuck?
Did I say to kill anybody?
Maybe I did.
Sorry, pal.
This is all a big
misunderstanding.
Perhaps I didn't make it clear
I had no intention
of being present
during the handoff.
We had a deal, the case
in exchange for the money
that you lost gambling
in my casino.
I'm a self-made man,
Yuri, just like you.
You made it clear you wanted to
leave your-your father out of this.
So I give you high marks
for your...
gallant attempt
at doing what's right.
I'm aware your father is not gonna
make good on your gambling debts.
So I brought you here
to renegotiate.
Man to man. Mano a mano.
So... I'm listening.
What?
What the fuck did he say?
He said you're a dead man.
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I am very much alive.
I'm not that easy to kill.
We're all friends here.
So I'm sure you're gonna tell me
where the real case is.
You do that,
and I'll let you live
to see another day.
Yeah.
Boka, Boka, Boka, Boka!
Basta, basta.
The case is in a safe
in the mausoleum.
622 West Tomas Street.
See? That wasn't so hard,
was it, huh?
Yeah?
I'm listening.
What's he saying now?
Even if we get past the men,
we'll never get in the safe.
We'll see about that,
won't we?
Dispose of the body,
make it look like a robbery.
You said you'd let me go.
You misunderstood.
I said I would let you
live for another day.
Get me Lombardi.
Let's have some fun,
shall we?
- Hey, hey!
- What? Shit.
Sorry.
Did I wake you again?
I mean,
who needs an alarm clock
when I have
this every morning?
Yeah.
- What time's your shift today?
- No.
- No, what?
- No free food.
Who said anything
about free food?
Reyna...
Besides, I can't make it
to the restaurant today anyways.
I got some work
to take care of.
Work?
I thought you were done
with that shit.
You know Mom would be rolling in her grave if she
knew you were still doing that type of work.
I know.
But just remember
why I'm doing this, Reyna.
- Marcus...
- Just...
Just don't.
I'm gonna go put
some clothes on.
Jeez.
Is it just me?
I'm cold.
- Detectives.
- Hey.
What do we got?
Male. Caucasian.
I gotta take this, I'm sorry.
- What?
- I'm gonna be back in the car. You got this.
- Dobbs here.
- This way.
I'm at
the crime scene now...
The victim was found
about five hours ago.
- I thought you quit those.
- Oh. I haven't smoked for six months.
Doesn't count as long as you
don't light the damn thing.
Yeah, right.
What do we got?
Oh, yeah, it's
a run-of-the-mill mugging.
Poor sap got shot
in the stomach.
But look, there's no blood.
That's weird, right?
Oh, and look, there's-there's
restraints on his wrists.
What do you think?
He was dumped, meatball.
Sorry.
Hey, excuse me.
- Hi, Officer...
- Burke.
Burke. Yeah.
Can you take him
to the pathologist
and get the DNA run for him?
Thanks.
You got it, Detective.
Let's hope you do a better job
than Detective Walsh here.
Walsh.
Smoke that, man,
your mind's turned to mush.
Detective, we'll let you
know what we find.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- I do.
Hey!
Is that your, uh,
is that your pal Walsh over there?
- What'd he do now?
- It's nothing.
Just Walsh being Walsh.
Don't ask, don't tell, okay.
I like the guy.
He tries really hard, but...
just not good at it,
like my pops.
That's not why
I'm upset, though.
- No?
- No.
Mikhail Zoltoff is over there.
Ah.
So immediately your mind
goes into overdrive
and you jump and...
I mean, you've had that Ray Barren on your
dart board for as long as I can remember.
Let me remind you, Blake,
nothing sticks to that guy.
Not now, not last time...
What was the name
of that girl last time? Rihanna?
- Reyna.
- Reyna.
Ooh, she's a pretty girl.
Wonder what she's doing now.
Why don't you,
uh, let this all go.
Take the file, you put it in a box on
a shelf underneath a lot of other boxes
and you...
you forget about it, all right?
Listen, I need your car.
It's nice and warm in here.
And I'm gonna need it
for a little bit.
We don't need anymore
manic spells from you, okay?
'Cause, buddy,
you go kinda nuts.
Thanks for your help.
- Mr. Barren?
- Yeah?
Keep an eye on table two.
Yes, boss.
Marcus, my boy,
how are you?
What do you want?
Come on.
Is that the thanks I get
for taking care of you
after the military
fucked you up?
- What do you need, Ray?
- I've got a job for you.
It's a little complicated,
but nothing you can't handle.
I need you to bring me
this... this case
that's locked in a safe.
I'm not a safe cracker, Ray.
You were
an extraction specialist
with the Delta Force,
weren't you?
I mean, if something needed to be
retrieved using unconventional means,
you were the man to call.
At least you were.
By the way...
Marcus!
How's that lovely
sister of yours?
- Don't fucking mention her.
- Stop.
You're embarrassing yourself.
You... you act like your hands
are clean, but they're not.
You act like the hero,
because you're not.
You think I'm reasonable,
but I'm not.
You work for me, that leaves
nothing off the table.
- That includes your sister who I seem to remember...
- Ray...
...laid with me once or twice
on some table.
Well, should I ask Boka
to go grab her?
Huh? Third time's the charm.
Just tell me
where the fucking case is.
That's where things
get complicated.
Of course they do.
- No way.
- I told you,
- it's complicated.
- It's suicide!
Or freedom. For you.
For her.
Better choice.
You'll probably die anyway.
But what better place, right?
Take the car out back.
You are going to love this place.
They have the best corned beef and cabbage.
- It's 7:00 am.
- Yeah, it's a great time to start having meat.
- What're you doing?
- Hey!
It was your idea for me
to start smoking again.
I was kidding.
Oh, you're a meatball.
What if your wife finds out?
She gonna totally kill me.
Yeah, but if I'm going down,
I'm bringing you with me.
The fuck you are.
Yeah, yeah.
- She's gonna get you.
- Hi, welcome to Crossroads Cafe.
Uh, can we have a table?
- Uh, just... just two?
- Yep.
Uh, no Rhonda today?
No, she's visiting
family overseas.
Oh, good for her. Have you
been working here long?
Just a couple of months.
Get ready to see my mug a lot.
- Nice to meet you.
- Right this way.
Goddamn it.
All right, here you guys go.
And Miss Tina will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
So... you gonna eat,
or are you gonna stare
at the pretty host?
I'm, um, I'm actually gonna
use the bathroom.
- Oh.
- Order me something healthy, please.
I make no promises.
Where's my honey biscuits?
Tina!
God, it's that honey biscuits
guy at table 12 again.
Hey, you okay, Reyna?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Thanks, Tina.
Okay. I'm gonna go
check on five.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
How did you find me?
Coincidence. This is Walsh's
favorite place. I swear to God.
Oh, really? Whatever.
That's bullshit.
You think I'd eat here?
I didn't mean it like that.
You think you're special.
You're just
a disappointment like...
You think you just put on a uniform
and do whatever the hell you want.
Well, your words mean shit.
You used me to get to Ray
and then you left me there,
like a fool.
I didn't leave you there.
There was nothing I could do.
I've checked on you.
Oh. Well, while you
were checking on me,
did you see that I had
to give everything up?
I had to leave everything
behind because of you.
Everything.
Reyna, I'm sorry.
Grow up, Blake.
I have to work.
622 West Tomas Street?
No, bro, that's suicide.
That's Russian mob down there.
I know it is, buddy.
I just need the layout.
- You need the layout?
- Yeah.
What exactly do you
think this is, Marcus?
You just walk in here,
say you need something, and bam!
I drop my vape, solve my Rubik's
cube and pull a detailed schematic
of a Russian mob hideaway
out of my ass?
Yeah.
- Fuck.
- Give me that.
- 622, not 266, right?
- 622, Auggy.
- Come on, stop fucking around.
- I got it, I got it.
It's a mausoleum.
It's a mausoleum,
you know that, right?
Full of Russian guards. I mean,
I'm not one for foreshadowing,
but it doesn't really get
much clearer than this, dude.
Yes, I have blueprints
of the entire city.
You're a smart guy,
you know that?
Are you sure
you want to do this?
We're talking alarms,
armed guards.
I mean, hell, I don't even know if
I'd make it out of this place alive.
Don't expect any cameras, 'cause Russians
tend to veer more on the analog side,
which could play in your favor,
but could also lead to your death.
I mean, it's an abyss,
a black hole.
You go in there, we have no idea
the horrors you might face.
Dude, I'm just getting the case
and getting the hell out.
Well, if it's in this place, it might as
well be the Ark of the fucking Covenant.
Was the Ark inside of a safe?
- How dare you.
- What?
No. It's... it is the safe.
It's a gold box
with bars to lift it...
Wait, wait. Are you telling me right
now this thing is inside of a safe?
Marcus, no! No,
this is getting a lot harder.
Auggy, buddy, listen to me.
I'll be fine.
I just gotta get the safe open.
All right,
this is Margherita.
It's an advanced password cracking
program of my own design. Okay?
As long as it's digital, the
safe, we can crack it remotely
and tell you where to place it
and we'll do it.
Wait.
What if it's mechanical?
Right. Um...
Let's see...
Ah! This will
take care of that.
- Really?
- Yes.
So I will be able
to tell you where to go
accordingly to my action cam.
All right?
It's right here, you put it in your
pocket and put it on your chest later.
Perfect.
Looking good, you ready?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
This'll, uh, this'll work, right?
Yeah, I'll be your set of eyes
and ears beyond that wall. Okay?
I'll be able to see what you see and
point you in the right direction.
But this shit is illegal, okay?
And it's dangerous.
If something goes down,
I'm completely powerless.
- Marcus.
- I'll be careful, Auggy.
That's great, but I was
gonna say don't get caught.
I won't.
And if you do,
you don't know me.
Love you too, Augustus.
I tell you never
to say that name!
He's dead.
Hey, sis,
it's nice out here today, huh?
Wanted to say hello before I head
over to the mausoleum and see Annie.
I need to fix these glasses.
You're not
answering your phone.
My oncologist likes to talk.
He saying anything good?
Oh, yeah.
It's all good.
Hunky dory.
I need you
back at the station.
I can't get you
to drop this case?
Drop this case?
I've been working this case
for six years.
Hey, Dobbs.
We all got problems.
Everyone.
But we fucking
deal with them.
We deal with them...
I like it here.
I like it here!
I can... I can complain
and no one talks back.
Right?
Dobbs.
Mm-hm. I'm still working on it.
I'll head there after it's done.
All right?
Okay. Yeah, I got it.
All right. You ready, Marcus?
Because it is showtime.
Ready as I can be.
All right,
we're up and running.
All right, action cam is up
and we are live.
How's the baby earpiece?
Can you hear me?
Why is nothing going on?
It's actually pretty boring.
Shut the fuck up, Auggy.
I'm just saying.
You're just standing there.
When are you gonna "Van Damme"
leg split someone,
do something,
we don't got all day now.
I know, I'm working on it.
Dump a plant! Real clever.
You're so dead.
What're you waiting for?
All right, you got him. Okay, uh,
grab his key card, you're gonna need that.
Take your time, big boy.
It's not like we're in a hurry or anything.
I got it, I got it. Come on.
- Parkour!
- Shut up, Auggy.
All right, now use his key card
at the front entrance.
On your right.
On your other right.
Good.
All right, I guess it's lunch time so
there's less people than I thought.
This is good.
Bogey coming at your noon.
All right, act casual.
Just super casual.
Not that casual.
You're clear right now,
but sneak faster.
Gen Z. Always on their phones.
Wait here. Let me see the whole
area before you take him out.
All right.
Okay, we're clear up top
and down both hallways.
I'd take him to pound-town
right about now.
Like a cheetah!
Yeah! Get him! Give him a...
Give him the-the Nelson!
The full... Yeah!
Let's go.
All right, now grab the body, take him down
in that little back room, that little cellar.
Yeah, make it quick.
We don't have much time.
Dude, can you drag him any slower?
He's like the size of a child.
Come on. Go, go, go.
You're clear.
All right, all right.
Now head west.
Go through the hall, all the way
down, third door on the right.
Take that hallway down, two
lefts, and then another right.
What the fuck?
Marcus, you hear me?
Marcus! Shit!
Marcus, you hear...
- Mar...
- Auggy. Auggy, can you hear me?
Marcus! Marcus!
Shit!
Shit! Fucking Auggy!
I'm down. I'm fucked!
Auggy! Where the fuck are you?
- Auggy!
- Scott, is it clear down there?
Clear at the safe entrance.
Copy that.
Auggy!
Auggy, where's the fucking safe?
Come on! Come on, baby.
Let's go.
What's going on?
Come on, come on, come on.
Auggy, I found the safe.
What do I do?!
Uh...
Auggy.
Huh!
God!
Come on, what... Yes!
Marcus, you alive?
Marcus! You hear me?
I'm alive.
Where the hell were you?
Thought I lost you there
for a second there, buddy.
You look so cute
when you struggle.
- Nice timing, asshole!
- I'm trying my best.
Okay, now, where's Margherita?
Give me a clear shot, Marcus,
I can't do this without it.
I'm fucking trying!
Ah!
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Marcus.
All right, I got it.
Let me put it in.
Okay. It's almost there.
Five more seconds.
I don't have five seconds,
Auggy.
Got it!
- It worked!
- Success!
Whoo! Let's go!
- Yeah!
- Never doubted you for a minute, buddy.
Oh, thank God. That big bag
strictly for confidence.
- Yeah?
- You're still alive.
Does that mean the job is done?
Yeah. I'm on my way to you.
No, don't. You may have a tail.
Well, then,
where do you want me to go?
I'm gonna have someone meet you
in the mannequin warehouse
next to the abandoned
Jormon building.
Yeah, I know it.
You did good, Marcus.
Just don't forget
our fucking deal.
Hey.
Want to put your hands on
the wheel there for me, please?
Detective, by the way.
All right.
Just get out of the car
for me, would ya, please?
Come on. Slowly.
Come on. Come on.
Step out. Come on.
Come on.
Slowly.
Move around to the back
of the vehicle, please.
- Slow it down.
- Just calm down, Detective.
Okay, hold it right there.
Pop the trunk.
Going slow.
Well, well, well,
look at this.
How about that?
Put your hands behind your head.
Come on, right now.
Amber City Police
Department, this is Officer Locke.
Locke, this is Dobbs.
Hey, I got a 2-17 in progress.
2212 Western Avenue,
it's in the warehouse district.
- Send somebody ASAP.
- Right away, Detective.
Good deal.
Got an old Beretta
right here, huh?
How about that?
Safety's off too.
- What the fuck?!
- How about that?
Huh. I'm gonna clean this off a
little bit right now. Don't move.
All units, there's a
217 in progress at 2212 Western Avenue.
32 responding.
- Let's go, 2-17, come on.
- What?
Yeah, 2-17! Let's go!
Where exactly do you intend
to go from here, Detective?
Your prints
are all over this car,
and there's a bullet from that
Beretta in poor Yuri right there.
So I'm the fall guy here?
You're a career thief,
you're not a saint.
And, hey, it's nothing personal.
I'm just cleaning up
some loose ends for Barren,
including you and your sister.
If it's any consolation,
Arkadi's guys are probably
gonna kill you.
It's not like they can let the
murder of his son go unanswered.
Come on, turn around.
Turn around! Come on!
This is gonna look bad, Marcus.
Oh, shit!
Hey!
Hey!
Go check on Dobbs.
I'm after Marcus.
- Motherfucker!
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Holy shit. That's Yuri Dubkova.
Go. Go!
Fuck!
What the fuck is this place?
Where's my gun? Oh, shit.
Blake, I didn't kill him, man.
I was set up.
Yeah, except for
the dead body in your car.
I didn't do it, man.
It was Dobbs. He's dirty!
Really? Of all the names
you can possibly give me
and fucking Dobbs is the one you
think I'm gonna believe is dirty?
Blake. Think about it, man.
You know him better than anyone else.
What does he have to lose?
The only reason why I'm working
for Barren is to protect my sister.
Bullshit.
Blake, you know
I'm not a fucking liar.
None of that matters now.
On your knees.
I know you're not dumb.
I said on your
fucking knees!
What're you gonna do, huh?
You gonna kill a cop?
Fuck this.
Just remember how this could've
ended if I was a different man.
Finning!
Finning!
Are you okay?
What happened?
Where'd he go?
- Dobbs?
- He's fine, he took off.
Let's go.
Where's Ray?
- Ray?
- I'm back here.
I fucked up.
You know, sometimes I wonder,
is what I ask of people too much
or are some people just
incapable of doing what I ask?
It got complicated.
Finning showed up
before we thought, and...
I fucked up.
I'm not mad,
I'm just disappointed.
You're my main guy.
I have Boka
working on a contingency.
Go to Arkadi and let him know
that Marcus killed Yuri.
Yo, Reyna.
I got her.
Bring him in.
Mr. Dubkova.
- Arkadi Dubkova.
- Oh.
Is there a chance
that we could speak privately?
What did my son do now?
- May I...
- Sit down.
Thank you.
You policemen are all alike.
Same style.
Guy's eating his supper,
by himself, the way he wants it,
and you always interrupt him.
I am so sorry, sir...
Your son has been killed.
My son?
Yes, sir.
You sure you
got the name right?
Yes, sir.
Sir...
- I want a name.
- I can't give you a name.
How much? How much?
- Uh...
- How much money?
I didn't come here
for the money.
I came here
because I wanted to tell you.
I lost my wife
two Christmases ago, all right?
She passed before I had
a chance to say goodbye.
Cancer took mine.
You-you can't kill cancer.
Really?
And I should give a shit about
your wife died from cancer?
You got a name,
and that's why I want a name,
and you understand
that's why I want a name.
So that's why one more time
I'll ask you, how fucking much?
Do you have a pen?
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
You know why
I appreciate this?
Because you
didn't have to do it.
And I'm sorry I said
what I said about your wife.
But I actually
feel you care.
How long
before I can see my son?
Well, he'll be moved
to the morgue within the hour.
So...
You're done, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you for this.
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.
Sit down.
One million dollars dead.
Two million dollars alive.
Now, go get it done.
Yes, sir.
Goddamn it!
Come on, Reyna,
come on, come on. Pick up.
Pick up.
Come on, Reyna, please.
Please, pick up.
Hey, it's Reyna
Lombardi. I can't get to phone right now,
but just leave me a message and
I'll call you back. Have a good one.
Reyna, it's me, Marcus.
Call me as soon as you get this.
Marcus,
I was hoping you'd call.
You set me up,
you motherfucker.
Well, I just
needed to do something,
and I had to get your sister
out of the equation.
You know, two birds, one stone.
So I saw you
picked up your truck.
You should've come inside,
would've loved to see you.
I mean, you're the one
with Yuri's blood on your hands.
When Arkadi finds out,
you'll be as good as dead.
One less piece of the puzzle
I have to worry about.
- Where's my sister?
- She's alive for the moment.
I'll tell you what.
Get me the case, and I'll make
sure her she stays that way.
But you got to hurry.
Time's running out.
Ray!
Ray! Fuck!
Think, think, think,
think, think...
What is this?
Auggy, it's Marcus. Let me in.
Come on, it's me, man.
I know you're in there.
I know! I got silent triggers
and hidden cameras everywhere.
- I'm a genius, remember?
- Stop fucking around, man. Let me in.
What did I tell you if shit went sideways?
I said you and I never met.
Auggy, I'm gonna break your fucking door
down if you don't let me in right now!
You will do no such thing.
Go away, Marcus.
Okay.
Holy shit! You broke
my fucking door down!
I told you I was gonna
break your door down!
Well, I hope you brought
new door money.
I'm sorry, man.
Listen, I just
really need your help.
- Please.
- Fine. I'll help you.
- Thanks, man.
- Just don't break any more of my shit. Please.
I'm sorry, man.
- I'm really sorry, man.
- You're like a bull in a china shop.
What's up?
Ray set me up,
man, that motherfucker.
He framed me for the murder
of Arkadi's son and took Reyna.
Shit. I figured
something was up.
Arkadi put a massive bounty on your head.
It's all over the wire.
- What?
- How much you think you're worth?
- How much?
- A million dead, two million alive.
- I almost took the job.
- Thanks.
Dude, you are in
some massive shit right now.
The hit's been out for less than an hour
and guess who's lobbying for your head.
- Who?
- Ballista Grey.
I heard she once decapitated
a guy
for stealing candy from a baby.
Hello, sister.
Get on your knees.
No, she didn't.
Oh, yes.
She is beautiful and deadly.
Oh, and don't forget
Walt and Rudy Pachinko.
You could say Walt is the brains,
while Rudy is definitely the brawn.
They'll do anything
for the buck.
They're not the best,
but they get the job done.
This is gonna be
a big payday for us.
Like shooting fish
in a barrel.
I really like fish.
I know you like fish, Rudy.
You're a Pisces.
You take the three on the right,
I'll take the two on the left.
- Grenade?
- I don't even wanna know where you kept that.
They'd, like,
shoot your grandma on the cheap.
- Yeah.
- Jesus.
Go. Ears.
- Grenade?
- Huh?
And topping off the list,
a hitman that goes by the name of Phoenix.
Ooh, he looks like
a tough son of a bitch.
I mean, you gotta be
with a name like Phoenix, right?
Dude, this guy is like
the real life Jason Bourne.
He's the guy all those hitman
movies are based on.
This guy can kill you
with a gun, a knife, a brick,
a bat with a rusty nail sticking out of
it, anything really.
- One.
- Hello, boys.
I mean, with a list like this after
you, I'd start writing my eulogy now.
Yeah? And who would show up?
Ouch.
I would come, Marcus,
if it didn't implicate me in
a major crime and mob cover-up.
Besides, man, I can't leave.
They have Reyna.
That's true. Look on the bright
side, man, no one knows you're here.
Take a nice nap before you
engage in super murder kill hour.
Auggy, I didn't come here to take a nap.
I need you to help me find her.
Take it easy,
I'm not Houdini.
Okay? I don't have a magic wand that
can just "poof" people into rooms.
Auggy, you're the closest thing
I have to a friend, man.
Are you just gonna
sit here and do nothing?
I need you to help me
find her, please.
I mean, I guess
as your best friend,
I might be able
to find her location.
If I can track the last
cell phone tower she pinged.
Wait a second. I might be able to
do the same thing with Ray's phone.
- Yeah.
- And that will help find her?
I mean, it's something, man.
You'll still have to get clues
and break her out of whatever
prison she's in, but...
- Oh, that I can do. That's...
- That's right.
- Extractor man to the rescue.
- Yeah.
- Marcus.
- I know, I know. I don't know you if shit hits the fan.
I was gonna say
be careful, man.
Thanks, man.
Listen, I'm gonna run
to Doc's real quick.
I have an idea
that can speed this up.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
And, uh, I'll call you if I get
any more info on your sister.
- And that's a big if.
- Thanks, man.
- Just... careful.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it. I got it.
Yeah. Don't forget
my door money!
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me! I'm in here!
Okay, okay.
Doc.
Doc!
Doc!
Doc.
Oh, shit.
Doc.
Oh, my God. Doc.
Ow! What the fuck, man?!
You fucked up my dream! Shit!
What do ya need?
Want some fried bologna?
No, I don't want
any fried bologna, Doc.
Oh, my... mm.
Listen, you still
have this place rigged up?
What do I look like,
Chubsy Ubsy?
Who the... Never mind.
Hey, man, I got myself in a bit of a
situation, and I really need your help.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah? Just like that?
You're in?
Yeah! I'm in the minute
you walked in, kid.
I just gotta make
a phone call then.
Do what you gotta do.
The fuck don't know
who Chubsy Ubsy is?
It's the fucking Little Rascals.
Oh.
Amber City Police Department,
this is Officer Locke. How may I help you?
- Detective Finning.
- Hold on one second, please.
Finning.
- It's Marcus.
- What do you want, Marcus?
Listen, I have something
that Ray wants.
Now, I don't have time
to fuck around.
I could sit here all day
and tell you that I was set up,
but you would never believe me.
- Ray took my sister.
- What do you mean he took her?
Oh, don't act like you give a
shit about her all of a sudden.
Oh, that's bullshit, Marcus,
and you know it.
Then prove it.
Meet me tomorrow morning
at 8:30 at the junkyard
off the old highway.
All I'm asking
is that you hear me out.
Whether you choose
to believe me or not,
I'm yours to take in.
Okay, Marcus.
I'll be there at 8:30.
But you fuck with me, I'm out.
Evening, Dobbs.
Hey. Was just coming
to get you.
- What's up?
- Go get Walsh, Locke and Burke.
Bring them in here, I gotta talk to
them, but keep it on the low.
Please.
- Uh...
- What?
Burke.
Locke, we need you.
Where's Walsh?
Donuts.
Hey! Walsh!
- Hey.
- Come on.
Oh, okay.
Hey, donuts.
What about "on the low"
did you not understand?
What're you doing?
It's donuts. Sorry.
You okay? Okay, good.
Now, I got a strange call
from Marcus Lombardi.
The guy who killed
the Russian's kid?
Yeah. He wants me to meet him at
the junkyard at Old Town Road.
What for? You're not gonna
cooperate with this thug, are you?
Deal with a thug?
He's the number one suspect.
Yeah, we're gonna deal with the
thug, that's what we do, we're cops.
I want to see what kind of intel
we can get out of him.
- Does the captain know?
- No.
And I don't want him to, okay?
We have no idea
who's on Barren's payroll.
Are you sure about this, Blake?
I... I just know
that Marcus isn't a liar.
- When's the meeting?
- 8:30 am.
- You guys good?
- Yeah.
On the low.
Enjoy your donut.
I'm in private.
You passed that information
on to our people?
- No, sir, I didn't.
- Why?
I wanted to run it
by you first, sir.
Well, did you think
that was what your job is?
- Tell them right away?
- Yes, sir, it is.
Why don't you go get it done?
- Now.
- Yes, sir.
Why?
Doc, you got me?
Yeah, kid.
You got cops
coming in from the east.
You got sensors
going off in the north
And you got maybe one of your assassin
friends roaring in from the south.
A mean looking one. She just took
out two of my cameras with knives.
Whatever you're gonna do,
kid, make it fast.
Make sure you get them
to the middle of the yard.
This way, ya got
the upper hand. Capiche?
Copy that, Doc.
I'll do my best.
All right. Chop, chop.
Let's go. I ain't got all day.
- About fucking time.
- What're you gonna do?
I'm not saying shit
in front of him.
It's all right,
I'll wait right here.
Ray is obsessed
with this case I got for him.
I don't know what's inside it, and to be
honest with you, I couldn't give a fuck less.
The only thing I care about is to use the
case as leverage to get my sister back.
We'll do the best job we can.
- How do I know that?
- You don't.
But we're your last option.
Fine.
Cuff it to your wrist.
I'm serious.
Cuff it to your fucking wrist. It does not
leave your hands until you get to the station.
- Do I have to do this, Detective?
- Locke...
Burke, you and Locke
take Dobbs back to the station.
Walsh and I will follow.
No stops.
All right.
Meet us down by the small road
by the junkyard.
All right.
- Where's Finning and Walsh?
- They're behind us.
Ah. That's what
we came for, yeah?
- Yeah.
- This is a huge waste of time, if you ask me.
The guy's a criminal,
simple as that.
Yeah.
Come on. Get in the car.
I'll drive.
Yeah. The sooner we get
this off, the better, right?
Yeah, come on.
Cuff him.
- Finning!
- Ah!
I got you dead to rights.
I'm here for Marcus Lombardi.
No one else needs to die.
Tell that cop to drop his gun,
slide it in my direction.
Walsh, put it down.
I don't have time for this.
Walsh, don't be fucking stupid!
Put it down to help Finning.
I got this!
All right, hang on, hang on.
- Get this thing off me!
- Here we go!
Oh, yeah, baby.
Showtime.
Move forward.
You're worth more
to me alive, Marcus.
I know.
Ready?
Ah! I gotta get leverage!
- I got it, I got it.
- Hurry up!
Watch your foot.
All right.
Come on!
Whoa! What the fuck?!
Ah!
We're wasting time here,
Marcus.
I can break both your knee caps
and carry you out of here.
I'll still collect
the two million.
Ahh!
Anything else to say?
I stole your knife.
So you're supposed
to be the best, huh?
I'm a little disappointed.
Fucked him up.
Didn't need this baby after all.
Ah! Don't!
What the fuck was that?
I don't like this.
You two stay here.
Fuck
Ray wanted to keep
a card up his sleeve,
just in case you
couldn't come through.
Well, I appreciate
the assistance.
I really do, but I got this.
Ah!
Fuck, Dobbs!
This whole mess is your fault
because you couldn't
keep Finning at bay.
You got sloppy, Dobbs.
You got too soft.
Once Finning gave us the case,
there was really
no need for you.
It's just business, Dobbs.
But it's also a little personal.
I hope the money is worth it.
Finning's a wrecking ball.
He won't stop
till he gets what he wants.
He'll have his hands full.
Boka, let's go.
You know, it's funny...
how some things just...
work out.
Have fun dying, Dobbs.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I gotta call Dobbs.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...
He's not picking up.
Try Burke.
Here.
Fuck.
Come on, Burke.
This is Ellen Burke.
Leave me a message.
What the fuck was that?
An assassin. Arkadi put
a bounty on my head.
- Oh, 'cause of Yuri?
- Is he dead?
Very.
How many more?
I don't know,
two, possibly three.
Grab this fucking guy.
We gotta get to the station.
Goddamn it!
Bingo.
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa. Things just got
a little more interesting.
I haven't had a blade this close
since '82, sweetheart.
And she bought me dinner first.
Take it easy.
Phoenix?
Yeah. He's dead.
So, what're you gonna do? Huh?
What're you gonna do?
You gonna
use this thing or what?
I'm not gonna kill you,
old man.
- Hey.
- But I am gonna use you.
I'm not that old.
All right, all right.
Take it easy.
- Officer Burke.
- Barren.
I see you have my case.
You got the payment?
Don't I always?
Next time you need another inside guy, can you
make sure he doesn't develop a conscience?
I don't like having
to clean up in-house messes.
But you do it so well.
- Right now, I'm all you've got.
- Hm.
So you should remember that.
Good luck opening it,
didn't come with a key.
You know, the Russians are so cheap
when it comes to the small details.
The keys from the other case.
If this doesn't work,
a well-placed bullet
should do the trick.
You gotta love the Russians.
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you, Barren.
No, no, no, no, no.
The pleasure is all mine.
Trust me. It's all there.
You can never be too sure.
- You can't kill a cop.
- No? Just watch me.
All this chaos
for two small pieces of silver.
Money can make people
do strange things.
Just like the rug,
I bought it just for you.
Just get it over with!
People are so easy.
You just have to know
what buttons to push.
Yours was greed.
Your price was too high.
And you think
too much of yourself.
Now you're gonna realize
what you're really worth.
Boka.
Clean up this mess.
And, uh, Marcus' sister,
take care of her.
Got it.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Doc, are you okay?
Am I okay? I haven't been
this excited since '95.
Let me guess, another one
of your fucking friends?
Hey, what are you doing?
Just trust me.
No one else
is dying because of me.
Let him go,
and I'll go with you.
You don't look like much,
but you handled
Phoenix pretty fast.
He always did get the best hits.
Well, this is awkward.
Can I go? 'Cause I got business
to attend at the trailer.
You two should come with me because
things are about to get crazy.
- We're good here.
- Just go with him.
I've never had cops
in my trailer.
This should be interesting.
So how do you
want to play this?
It's your call.
But one way or another,
I'm taking you in.
You have the wrong guy.
The money's telling me
I've got the right guy.
Doc! Doc!
Yeah, yeah, we're here, we're here.
Hold your horses. All right.
Fuck!
Well, it looks like we're a little
late for the party, brother.
You know, I fancy myself
a reasonable individual.
So as a professional courtesy,
I'm gonna give you one chance
to hand him over to us.
Before I let my brother here
squish your head like a grape.
Sorry, boys, he's mine.
I was hoping you were gonna say that.
Now, do me a favor
and go step on that tomato.
Did you know the tomato
is a fruit, Walt?
I know tomatoes are fruit, Rudy!
I know!
Now, she's the tomato,
go stomp on that tomato.
Oh!
Whoo! Whoo!
Doc, now's a good time
for that show.
- Anytime, Doc. Anytime now!
- Yeah, yea, yeah, yeah.
This better work.
You know I love the thrill
of the hunt,
but are you really gonna
make me chase you, Marcus?
Whoo!
- Anytime now, Doc.
- It's about time to show off your talents, Betsy-girl.
Here we go. Stay behind a car
because it's gonna get loud.
Wait. That's your plan?
To blow everybody up?
Hey, hey. Yes, Detective.
Come on.
Shit!
Son of a bitch!
This shit ain't working.
What do you mean
it's not working?
I don't know.
It's been sitting too long.
Man, I got a trip wire
in the car pit
with a bunch of explosives.
Lead them there and then get
the fuck out of there, quickly.
- You hear what I'm saying?
- Copy that, Doc.
- How's the bologna?
- Oh, it's very good. Thank you.
You know...
I could just kill you.
A million bucks is a lot
of pizza bucks for Rudy.
Shit!
Walt? Walt!
Brother! Are you okay?
I'm fine!
Did you squash the tomato?
I lost the tomato.
She rolled away.
Get your ass over here,
he's getting away!
Brother, are you okay?
That way!
Oh, shit!
- You're not taking me in.
- Watch me.
Come on, Walt. Come on, Walt.
Come on, Walt.
- Walter?
- Rudolph.
Fuck!
Ah!
Nothing personal.
Oh!
Look who it is!
You're not dead, kid!
Yeah. Thanks, Doc.
- What do we do with her?
- I'll take care of her.
- Oh?
- Yeah, don't worry. I'll hold the fort.
You guys finish whatever convoluted
adventure you were on. Go on.
Let's get
the fuck out of here.
Wait, wait.
What about my car?
Take his car.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- Good luck, kid.
- Thanks, Doc.
All right. Good job.
Just me and you, darling.
Where the fuck is the case?
Locke is dead,
the case is gone.
What the fuck happened?
Blake, I'm part of this.
I-I bugged Ray.
Burke is part of it too.
She has the case.
Blake, I don't have time for this shit,
my sister's in danger! I got to go!
Shut the fuck up.
I've had enough.
You want to shoot me?
Fucking shoot me, Blake!
Do it!
The tapes are behind
Annie's plate at the mausoleum.
Your sister... Rey...
Balboa...
Get the fuck out of my way!
I'm sorry.
Call it in.
This is Detective Walsh.
I have two officers down,
Locke and Dobbs.
About a quarter mile
west of I-42...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Shit won't come out.
It went back in. Jesus.
Gotta relax.
Here we go! Now we gotta open
the fucking window.
Ooh! Smells like gasoline
in here.
Gotcha.
What the fuck, Houdini?
It's all right.
He's all right.
He'll be all right.
Five minutes
till Bachelor in Paradise.
Oh, baby.
Gotcha.
Thanks, Annie.
Dobbs, throw Yuri in the
trunk of the car and get Marcus.
Once Marcus gives you the case,
we'll kill Yuri
and frame Marcus for it.
That motherfucker.
Hey, what's up, man?
You been sitting there too long,
man, you can't stay there.
No, no, listen, I'm sorry.
Can you just tell me
- where Sarkisian Street is?
- I don't care, man.
You got to move your car,
you can't stay there.
Oh, come on, man,
can you just tell me
- where Sarkisian Street is?
- It's probably over there!
- But you cannot leave... Ah!
- There?
Ahh!
Ah!
How many are there?
- Ah!
- How many?
It's just me, man.
It's just me.
Take me to my sister.
You want to fuck
with my family? Huh?
Motherfucker.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
Couldn't make this easy,
could you?
Where's Reyna?
You... you shot me.
Bobby, where the fuck
is my sister?
- I'll show you.
- Yeah, you will.
- Stay away from me!
- Reyna!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Put your shoe on.
- Okay.
Bobby?
Here, get behind me.
Grab this! Grab this!
Run back to my place! Go!
He went this way.
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!
Fuck!
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
Ah!
You look like you've been busy.
- Doc?
- He's alive.
You want to take me in,
but that's not gonna happen.
Do you really want
to die today?
Don't you have something
more to live for?
We can do this your way
if you want, but just remember,
it hasn't worked out great for the
others, or we can do it my way.
I'm listening.
I have to go
in to Arkadi's alone.
That is the only way I can clear my name.
Now, listen to me.
I promise you,
I will get you your money.
You have a week.
If I don't have
that money by then,
I will find you
and we can finish this my way.
Deal.
Detective Finning.
To what do I owe this honor?
We need to talk.
You look like
you're living in a dumpster.
Can I offer you
something to drink?
I've got some
really good whiskey.
Macallan, single malt.
Got a new rug, Ray?
Yep, the other got soiled.
I had to get rid of it.
How's it feel?
How's what feel?
Knowing this could be
your last free breath.
The wisdom of uncertainty.
In there lies the truth.
Hey, listen, Finning.
Before you start
with all your accusations,
let me give you a tour.
You know, I'm sure you're-you're
dying to look around.
Nothing but some-some gaming tables
and the smell of dancing ladies.
Hm? It's all legal.
I've got permits.
Come on. Come on.
The funny thing is...
I really like you, Blake.
Do you mind me
calling you Blake?
I like you
because you're simple.
Like how I offered
to give you a tour,
and at the same time managed to
walk you right through to the exit.
Well, thanks
for stopping by, Detective.
I enjoyed
every moment of it.
By the way...
I'm sorry about your partner.
There's one more thing, Ray.
Scout's honor?
Remember that case you caught?
Turns out you violated
all sorts of laws,
including framing
an innocent man,
and multiple...
multiple cases of murder.
Sounds like
a conspiracy theory to me.
You're a great
manipulator, Ray.
You get those people
that are desperate,
or you threaten
their families.
You know, then you
have them do your bidding.
Then you just fucking
toss them aside.
The problem with that way
of thinking, Ray,
is that eventually one of them
is smart enough to realize
what the end game is.
So they start doing things
like bugging your office.
Gathering evidence
when you're not around.
You know, like a...
like an insurance policy.
And then when they're
laying on their death bed
from the bullet
that you put in them,
and they ask you to lean in
so they can tell you all
their dirty little secrets...
The bullet
you in my partner...
- sealed your fate.
- Hm.
Ray Barren, you are under arrest
for corruption, fraud, and murder.
You have the right
to remain silent.
This ain't over.
Oh, Reyna! Thank God.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Oh, my God. Is it over?
- It is for you.
- What?
- Listen to me, listen to me.
I just got to do one more thing
and we'll be safe. Reyna.
- I promise you. Okay?
- Okay.
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.
- Okay.
- Hey. Just do me a favor.
Don't open the door
for anyone. Okay?
- Okay.
- Be careful.
Thank you, sir.
Oh...
Oof.
What happened to your nose?
You don't want to know.
So you're my son's killer.
No, sir.
You remind me of a story.
Have you ever heard the story
of Vasilli the Unfortunate?
Enlighten me.
Vasilli was
the seventh of eight
of a very poor farmer
out in the country.
And the king of all that area
decided to give all
of his riches to the farmer.
And the king decided
that he wanted to be
the guardian of Vasilli.
So after the king had given all
of his riches to the poor farmer,
he didn't think
he made the right decision.
And he was unhappy about it.
So he took Vasilli
to the edge of the cliff
overlooking the big harbor...
and pushed him off.
But this is the luckiest prick
you ever knew.
Because he fell
in a fishermen's boat.
The fisherman's name
was Marco.
And all Marco did was he
kept trying to kill Vasilli
again and again and again.
And he couldn't do it.
And the sickest thing
about it is...
the son of a bitch kept
coming back again and again
because he didn't know
what else to do.
Now what can I do for you,
my Vasilli?
Sir, I didn't kill your son.
And why should I believe a man
that I've paid a good deal
of money to have killed?
At the end of Vasilli's story,
he uncovers an oak tree
and discovers riches.
Dobbs,
throw Yuri in the trunk
of the car and get Marcus.
Once Marcus
gives you the case,
we'll kill Yuri
and frame Marcus for it.
Your son was working
with Barren.
He wanted to cut you out to prove
to you that he can be his own man.
Unfortunately for Yuri,
Barren doesn't
play well with others.
Ray is incarcerated, but, um...
that shouldn't be
a problem for you.
And what might
a person have to pay
for that information?
I want my name cleared...
and my bounty.
I've brought you
Marcus Lombardi alive.
Sure.
Do we have a deal?
Barney. Bag.
How does it look to you?
Like a new beginning.
A deal's a deal.
Don't go poetic on me.
I gave a guy with a limp
a gazillion dollars.
Am I an asshole or what?
- Hey! Oh!
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry we're late.
- It's okay. She sleeping?
Yeah, she slept
the whole way here.
I mean,
traffic was just terrible.
Don't even worry about it.
I've got all the time
in the world.
Look at this. Sonny boy
knows what he's doing, right?
Right?
You know what I mean, Lumpy?
That's why you
help your friends out.
I don't fuck around.
Look at this shit.
- We got it. Home free.
- Thank you so much. Have a nice day.
Hello, welcome to Crossroads Cafe.
How can I help you?
I got it, I...
- What?
- What?
That's how you're
gonna talk to your brother?
What do you want?
- How 'bout that free food?
- No.
