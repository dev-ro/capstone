You know what... i dont care what other people think
and i think you should
We are thank full of america and CIA
Who reminds us jihad
At that time the mujahideen are together
in afghanistan from all over the world
And more are coming
You are very late... interview is started... the maulana sahib
abusing to english peoples
Television has make ourjob easy
Allover the world the fame of islam
They them self automatically conveinced
for these jihadi activities
Where from you get money forjihad
and who train them
The CIA Sent me the dollar and weapons
for kill russians
At that time our fighting was jihad
CNN call us mujahideen at that time
Now we are terrorist
May be the drug money helped you
forjihad?
You are reporter but if you won't to see something
you will not see till you are not intrested...
and drug is not allowed in islam
therefore the taliban destroyed the hemp field
But you cant see that!
If i have the previlage to make drug so i want to
make drug and sent to west
Oh My God Your thinking is very bad!
My dear lady i wish you knew little bit of history
also... about great british war on china...
Thank you maulana for having us here and
speaking to us
Greetings!
He is my friend sermat... he live here in lahore
He is very good singer of tv...
he is not beliving that i gave up singing cause of you
Where do you live in lahore?
Sir we have farm house near drivin!
We born in village... so we make our way islam.
You are birth of farm houses... so you must be a singer or like that
No... no maula sahib... He's not that kind a person
even he wants to meet with you...
I think Shaer shah told you that i spent my
first 15 days in punjab
And next friday in shahi masjid i'll
speech! Will you come there?
Yes sir i'll come!
This mosque was made by my grand grand father
wazir khan!
Therefore we never think about to leave the mosque
Marry!
Yes daddy!
Come down darling i want to show you something
What happend
They'r your cousins... my elder brother's sons
My God they are gud looking!
Their face similar to me!
What is their names?
Names? I dont know!
These are all weapon that we are using
to defeat west
The white people only respect those
who have own identity!
What was the reason that nusrat fateh name person
made own identity in white people's country
and others cant made same type of identity
here!
If you want to impress white people's
to look diffrent
I taken his name only for example
but whatever he did... there is no space like that in islam
Good bless him!
Whatever he did... in the sight of God it was bad work
Singing and music are prohabited in islam
like lying is prohabited...
like gambling is prohabited
like flesh of pig is prohabited
It will take whole day and night
to tell you about hadith of prohabiting of music
there several hadith are valid to prove that
there's no space for music in islam
How was your meeting with maula?
Is that maula gave you any comments
against music?
No... but i just was thinking that there's
some reason therefore they'r against music!
Leave it!
They are against even laughing
Sarmat are you gone mad
what are you talking like that
Why are you guys yelling?
I dont know... you ask him!
Sarmat what happend son?
He's saying i am not going to show!
Why?
I just dont want to go!
The maula tought him all that!
Brother is yelling on metter
i am just not in mood!
I just researched that the music is
prohabited in islam
lts just he's choice!
Are you gonna force him
Son get fresh... why are you not shaving?
I think he is growing beard!
If he want to keep beard so what?
Come lets go!
If you stop him so he will react
take it easy
How long he can leave the music
I hope so dad!
I hope so too!
Listen... come here
Sit here
I gonna miss you!
Ohh... but dads promise me to meet you parents!
Sarmat you are doing big mistake. If this Proffesion
is bad so why mom and dad are allowed us.
Are we not muslim?
Try to take it logicaly!
Lying, gambling, stealing, wine, everything is
abviously harmfull for human!
You tell me what is harmfull in music
what is wrong with it?
Tell your brother that gambling, lying, stealing, wine,
are minor harmfull than music.
Because their harm only who get who did it...
but music ruined everyone who listen it...
To sing rubbish in such song like that...
are too much harmfull
Why dont you tell him that his real objection
is on poetry but whats wrong with music.
Use your mind
What i do maulana my brother make
me silence, i got confused again
Dont listen your brother
take desicion by heart
If any wise charistain silence you
so will you be christian? Or hindu
Take desicion from heart
not from brain for giveup music
And its matter about your brother
keep distance from him for few days. And come here
Marry are you awake darling!
Yes daddy!
Is it ok if sit with you for a while!
I have suprise for you
i accept your desicion
you can marry with dave!
Are you serious?
Yes!
You and me going to pakistan next week

Thank you daddy
I spent lots of years to thinking about if
mom was with us... but i have'nt complaints now!
Now i can proudly say
my father is great
I am going for 10 days
what's the matter with you
Why he is going so sudden
he never goes pakistan before
He is going to meet his mother
And he's gonna buy me a flat in london
What will you do with flat in london
What happend where these painting gone
You can think what has happend!
Sarmat did?
Dad he is doing to much overact
you are worried about painting
but your mom worried about something else!
Whats wrong mom
He is forcing to wear hijaab! What?
I cant belive it
He has very sweet voice!
Sweet voice only has singers... Say great voice
But this generation is very bad
to make it god... do practicle something
Mom... sarmat is here...
What oh my God

How are you?
I am marry remember i talk to you on the show?
Come here
This beard looks good at your face!
I lied to marry and brought her here!

Look cause of this unforgiving attitude
i leave from here
I am the first man who did mistakes
everybudy do pray at old age
Forgive me... my girl will got married with
non muslims my next generation will ruined
Hussain if you care's about you previous
generation then you never worried about next...
let me tell you clearly
in this house no one force to another!
I'll ask to mansoor if
he is agree... so i am agree!
Why dont you brought your wife with you?
Because you will feel bad to coming her here!
Why
Because she is not my wife...

Look i knew that you will react like that
Here is bad thing but there is'nt
Eventhen... you dont feel shame

Who is the lucky man?
Well his name is dave
and he is the one i am get married to
Is he white boy? Yes
Will you come at my wedding?

because i am going to america after two week
i am sorry to say it uncle
i can not be a party of such crime... this is lying!
But that white boy is christian.
You want that you uncle's next generation will christain
Dont black mail me at the name of islam
you are very far from islam.
Its ok i came here depends on you
you were my last hope!
Marry will stay here
weather at you home or grave yard

To stopping a innocent muslim girl

Then what if i dont... suppose i am the craziest
girl that nothing is more important for...
compromising for your relationship!
Will you take me for ride after marriage
What about kids?
What we have kids? As many as you like
Yes but what will their name a muslim name
or a christian names... what culture they would belong to
What faith they would follow the muslim faith
or christain faith?
You forgot something... when they die
they will go to muslims hell or christians hell
You are making fun of me?
No... i am not but i dont like your negative attitude
You have no rights to insult my feelings
I am feeling that i am beging you to marry me
I hope its a boy

You know the man sarwat?
Yes... His wife lodge the case for raping
Wife lodge the case on court?
Whats that mean?
Mulla sahib was anger for your running away from ship
But i convience him to forgive you. So he forgave you...
Now you will bail soon
and you will won the case definetly!
Mulla sahib will come in court himself
for you
Just sign on it
whats this?
We will lodge the case about the childs
owning
We can kill the child but let her out with her
Dad... have you got any news about brother mansoor?
In the front of court the two case are present
But both are too attached so we decided...
that we will hear both togheter!
We need answer of two questions!
1 rst that without of wishing of girl
her wedding is capable or not
And 2nd is that if its not capable so
who is the hare of this kind of child
1 rst witness is maula tahiri who will come from
the side of culprit
I'll tell the truth
i am here only for your honor
Maulana do you agree with that you
provoke sarmat to marry with maryam forcely?
Yes i agree
Tell me the jihad is a good work huh?
So why you collect the money from everyone?
Just rob the bank...
because its good work!
You profession is arguement
come to the point!
A saving of girl from being a non muslim
was neccesery or her desire
being a muslim girl to marry a non muslim boy
its prohabited!
So tell me if a adult muslim girl wants to marry
with nonmuslim so what should she do?
Should she leave the islam?
If she leave the islam she will become Murtid!
And punishement of death is for Murtid
So thats mean there's no way?
Yes ofcourse!
Wrong... wrong... there is no such thing in islam
Is that right to ask the girl about her marriage
Could be ask but the previlage
of taking desision only have parents
So what need to ask?
This crowd is getting happy on my
abusing
Their parents never interfare in their life
and they too
after marriage the girls informed their parents
Mom i got married yesterday!
The court respect you maulana
but keep remember you are not giving speech.
Maula we are coming on another subject!
You make his singing stop
Yes... the painting and the music is
prohabited
But any muslim boy wants to be a painter
or a musician... so what should he do
Do nothing... there is'nt any another work
for do?
You hav'nt written anything yet!
Listen... i want to meet with
maulana wali?
You go upstair and wait there
he will come
lts time to pryer if you have short discusion
so you can otherwise after pryer?
Pryer is just exercise
do now or later nothing matter?
Very intresting... To calling my pryer to exercise
you look hurted
God will never happy if you hurt his
mankind
You are right but whom to i hurted?
The high court calls you to give statement in a case!
But you refused... ohh yes...
i dont want to get in this troubles
If the court punished the innocent
but the break should'nt come in your pryer
Are you a journalist? Or a advocate
or from N.G. O
Who i am is a relevant
Why women goes to N.G. O for take support?
I am sorry you will feel bad to hear...
Reading books and prying is very easy in the room
But saying truth and to take pain
for truth is very hard
You know what ill hold you coller
upthere... and i'll tell to God that...
this man had time to pray for
but has'nt time to support innocent!
Mansoor its me janie
Greetings
