TEL AVIV
Excuse me !
Excuse me !!!
It's hard to order a drink around here
Let me try !
Hey bro !
Not bad at all !
Hold on !
Just a sec.....
Anyway....
You can have this one !
- What's this ?
- Try it !
It's too strong !
- Are you trying to get me drunk ?
- Is it so obvious ?
Quiet, quiet please !
Hey DJ lower the volume !
How are you doing girlfriends ?
Having fun ?
Well, it's almost 11:00 pm and
we'd be leaving soon....
...at least those who do not want
to be conspicuous at home....
...and therefore want to stay
out of trouble.....
Next month, our divine Iman will be
with us again, here !
- By the way, my name is Roy
- I'm Nimer
Ah, you made it !
- I missed you !
- Missed you too !
-They almost caught me at the borders
- Who ?
How do you mean "who" ?
I'm not gonna take this risk again !
You won't last that long
away from us......
Have found a place to stay ?
I found the perfect place !
You'd come and see it !
- Where is it ?
- Near by....
Aren't you afraid that they might
arrest you ?
Who ? The Israeli secret service ?
These dogs bark a lot but
they do not bite
The rooftop house that I've found
is absolutely safe
- Your drink
- Ah Roy, thank you !
Who's this gorgeous man ?
Roy, this is Mustafa
- Delighted I'm sure !
- Nice to meet you
And...how do you keep busy Roy,
when you're not in my parties ?
I'm a lawyer
Oh my God, a lawyer !
Roy, don't bother with Nimer !
He will leave to the US one day !
You need a nice wife like me !
Hi darling !
- You're amazing !
- Thanks sweetheart
- How are you ?
- Good ! And you ?
- Let's a take a picture together ?
- Sure !
I had a great time
Shall we dance ?
- Maybe later
- Bye bye boys !
- What kind of law do you practice ?
- All kinds....
In fact I work with my father
- What ?
- That's nice
- Are you making fun of me ?
- No, no ! I do think it's nice !
-Do you work with your father also ?
- No, no !
My father died when I was 12 years old
That's why I think it's really
nice that you work with your dad
Yeah, it's true !
I didn't mean to spoil our mood !
- Let's start all over again...
- OK
- Hi !
- Hi !
I'm Nimer and I'm
a student of psychology
- Look at these two poofters !
- Disgusting !
Did you hear that ?
Let's go get them !
- Are you serious ?
- Just to scare them a bit ?
OK, let's do it ! Let's go !
Hey you, s.o.b !! Come here
and I'll show you !
You small-dick wankers !
Oh boy, I'm out of shape
Unbelievable ! They were
scared shitless !
I should had been screaming
to them in arabic
That'd be great !
Well....
You want to study in the US.....
Not necessarily the US.....
but that's my plan !
-The important is to get outta here, huh ?
- Yes
Sometimes I too want to leave, to go
to some place else.....any place....
...and start from scratch
Leave your father's firm ?
Leave everything back ?
Without hesitation !
So, what's stopping you ?
I have no idea !
Excuse me ?
I'm sorry to ruin your wedding plans...
Nimer, Hamada is leaving now and he
can give you a lift home
- Tell him I'm coming
- OK
What happened ?
-I'm leaving. I'll get a lift home
- Wait ! I can drive you home !
- To Ramallah ? (Palestinian city)
- Ah, that......
Is there a problem that I'm from there ?
No ! Really no !
I'm serious ! I can drive you there !
Maybe next time
Fine....
But...
....there has to be a "next time"
Roy Schaefer, Attorney-at-law
RAMALLAH, PALESTINE
10 Km north of Jerusalem
She's got to start
treatment with medication
She must not be hospitalized
Her depression is  treatable
- What about her children ?
- Social Services could take them
It would be a mistake to remove
the kids from their mother
I'm only a student, but....
...her depression is related
to our political situation
Dead husband, one son in Israeli prison
she's completely alone.
Instead of rummaging her past
we must give her prospectives
If we remove her children, it'd be as
if we're stealing them from her
We need to think the welfare of the kids
She's no danger to anybody
The kids said so themselves. There's
no need to put her in a hospital
-But the mother can't take care of them
- Let the kids stay with the grandparents
Let them stay with the grandparents
until she's stabilized
The mother will be able to
withstand this compromise
OK. We'll give her medication....
And she'll be allowed to visit
the children ever 14 days.....
....until her situation slowly improves
OK ?
- Tomorrow is my last interview
- Well done ! Congratulations !
What does this mean ?
- Then, I'll be allowed to go over there
- Over there ? Meaning Tel Aviv ?
- Only once or twice a week
- "Only" ??
God will help you !
- You're very silent...
- You know my views !
Nabil !!!
We're calling for an Academic boycot
on Israel....
....and yet he wants to go and study there !
This is a great chance, with this
famous professor !!!
Yeah I know, the one from London !
And he could refer me to Princeton,
Cambridge or Stanford
-Who will pay for Stanford ?
- They give scholarships
And you'll get one....
but do you know why  ?
Because you're clever and
God gave you a bright mind !!
- Not because you must serve the Jews !
- Nabil, cut it out !
- You don't know how the system works
- I know pretty well !
Enough ! I'm off to the market
Are you coming ?
- Bye mother
- God bless you son !
-I'll keep my finger crossed....
- Thanks !
.....that you won't pass the exams.
I don't want you to leave !
Taste it and tell me your opinion
Much better !
But it still needs more salt ?
TEL AVIV
-Hey !
- Hey !
What a nice surprise !
I can't believe it !
How are you ?
-Well, what do you think of the place ?
- Fine !
-Avi let us live here
- For free ?
Darling, in this life.....
there's nothing free
Wait ! I brought you something
from home.....
I can't believe it ! I haven't
eaten this for ages !
Sit down ! I'm preparing tea
- How many persons live here ?
- Two more
One is from Bethlehem and the
other one from Ramallah
You just missed them
Thanks !
What's this ? You know that
I can't read Hebrew !
- It's my free movement Pass for Israel
- You're kidding me ? !
I want one too. Whom did you fuck with,
in order to get it ?
If only it were that easy !
But then.....this means that
you passed the exams ?
Congratulations ! This is great news !
We need to toast to that !
It's a pity we don't have any Vodka
- But we'll get some....
- Yes
- I'm very proud of you !
- Thanks !
Ah...before I forget !
Guess whom I saw last Saturday ?
Whom ?
Do you remember that cute lawyer ?
- He was asking me about you....
- Really ?
Look at him ! His cheeks turned red !
Why didn't you give him a call ?
Should I ?
What's your problem ? It's only a date !
-I don't need distractions right now
- You're very serious !
We do not meet men like him
every day
I know that he likes you
And now with your classes,
you'll be in Tel Aviv every week
Roy ?
We're here, at the end of the corridor
Sign here......
...and here...
Come on in !
We're almost done
Good !
Thank you very much Roy !
Don't mention it !
If you ever need anything, call me !
Thank you ! We're just
doing our job here
I mean it !
- For anything !!
- OK Roman !
He's trying to be modest !
But I owe him my brother's life
Come, I'll escort you to the elevator
I'll be right back
-It's so nice that you're here !
- What was all this ?
Who ? Roman ?
An important client of the firm
Not the kind of people I want to
deal with every day but....
....he's important for our office
His brother was in serious troubles
With this job of mine, I work
constantly, all the time.....
....and I've simply given up on myself
I don't think it's because of your job
Life is like that !
It happens to everyone
- You don't seem to have compromised
- You think so ! ?
- What are you doing there ?
- You better go back to your books
- Hey Nimer !
- Hi !
Are you now studying in Tel Aviv ?
- Leave him alone !
- OK, I'm off
You bring arms in our house ?
Don't you think this is too much ?
- Forget it, alright ?
- Are you playing it serious now ?
Nimer, your studies consume you
and you forget where we live !!
You were fighting for better education
and for human rights !
You'll tell me the values we're fighting
for ?  This is for you too, Nimer !
- Violence is not a moral value !
- What's happening ?
- Found something to argue about ?
-No, it ends here
What's the point of arguing ?
- Good night !
- I don't understand what you're doing !
I'm going to bed
Mustafa !
Why are you doing nonsense ?
I didn't do anything ! I promise you !
They wanted to bully me !!
- Are you trying to fool me ?
- No, no I give you my word !!
-I lost the number and couldn't call you
- You lost my number ?? !!
-Yeah, seriously !
- You lost my number ?? !!
- Yes....yes..
- Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !
Mustafa is of no use to me here,
anymore.  He's burnt !
What...what does this mean ? Burnt ?
I'm not burnt ! I promise you
I'll do anything you want !!
Give me your number again, I'll report
everything, I'll do anything you say !
Please !
His family has been notified.
Send him back to them !
No Gil please !
Don't send me back !
They'll arrest me !
Gil please !! They'll murder me !!
They'll arrest me and kill me !!
Don't send me back there !!
Sit down !
When I say "Shut up",
you shut up, do you hear ??
I'm sick of you all ! Sick !
I'm disgusted ! I had enough !
You didn't want my help.....
well now shut the fuck up !!
You bust my balls ! What
exactly didn't you undestand ??
- You faggot !
- Gil please !!
Don't leave me here !
They'll murder me !
- Get lost !
- They'll murder me !
Where are you going ?
I must take care of something.....
Take me home first
It's very urgent !
- Wait here ! I won't be long !
- Leave the car engine on !
-Peace upon you !
- Peace upon you too !
Why does he need to beat him up so bad ?
To make an example of him....
Who can say that he hasn't revealed
our Statesecrets ?
- Hi ! What are you doing here ?
- Give this traitor a lesson !
You should had waited in the car !
Why is he considered a traitor ?
He lives in Tel Aviv and
works as a male whore
Do you think the Jews let him live there
because of their good will ?
But this doesn't prove anything !
Free him !
Nimer !!
Are you trying to save him ?
He was giving head to Jewish dick !
- Who says he's a traitor ?
- I do !!
Amer !!
Nimer, you'll get in trouble !
- Do something !
- There's nothing you can do !
He's a poofter and lived in Tel Aviv !
The Israeli secret service
has sent him back !
-Therefore, you need to free him !
- Nimer, are you mad ?
Think a little bit !
Nabil, come on ! That's enough !
No !! Don't !! No !!
But why so far away ?
Who else is going to be there ?
Who else is coming ?
What kind of friends ?
OK, may I call you back in a while ?
OK, fine. Bye now !
What a nice surprise !
This is great ! What brings you here ?
What's wrong ?
Mustafa is dead
What happened ?
They arrested him here and deported
him to our side of the border
His kinsfolk murdered him
I'm very sorry !
But how are you ?
May I stay here tonight ?
Sure ! Of course ! You need  not ask !
Here, give me your rucksack !
Sit down !
- Would you like something to drink ?
- Just water
Hey !
Good morning !
Good morning !
How do you feel ?
You know that you can stay here
as long as you wish
Thank you !
And I'm saying that not just because
I'm a sweetheart....
I just....
...I don't want you to leave !
I don't want to leave either
When shall I see you again ?
On Sunday ?
Yom el-ahad ?     (= in arabic)
Youm el-ahhd !!
...ahhd !!
To the memory of Mustafa !
How did you meet Mustafa ?
The first time that I came to Tel Aviv
to check things out....
I was outside a night club...
I was really too scared to go in
I walked around
the building block ten times
There were a lot of boys at the entrance
I had the feeling that everybody
was staring at me
And then suddenly Mustafa noticed me
His face was smeared with red lipstick !
And he tells me.......
"Taal shu Khayef"    (=in arabic)
"Come here ! Don't be afraid !"
He got me inside the club. That night
he was performing there
And we became friends ever since....
- Hey Nimer ! What's up ?
- Hi !
What's your problem now ?
My problem ? You're putting
our family at risk !!
You're ungratefull ! I'm doing
all this for the sake of our family !!
Because you study in Tel Aviv !
- People here are gossiping about it !
- Let them gossip !
In order to build a State, we need
more than just soldiers !!
And you do not have the
monopoly on patriotism !!
Right ! My little brother can
discuss politics too !
True !
And I'm not talking about Palestinians
or Jews, about Fatah or Hamas !
I'm talking about a human being that
you have murdered !
Are you defending the poofter ?
It was his fault !!
How can you say that ?
Nimer it's time you grew up !
Yes "father" !
You better go to your room
and your studies
Go on ! Leave !
- Hi !
- Hi !
Don't you ever get tired
of reading so much ?
No, not really. Why ?
Just asking ! I never see you,
you're never home !
I also miss the old times, when
I had fewer things to do
Mother asked me if she could arrange
my matchmaking with Saeed
The grocer ?
- Seriously ?
- Yeah
The one with the freckles ?
Not so loud ! You'll wake up
the neighbours !
Mom, why aren't sleeping yet ?
You wanted me to iron your shirt
for tomorrow !
-What's happening tomorrow ?
- An event at the University
You go there on weekends too ?
Let's go to bed. It's late
- Mom....?
- Yes ?
Do you really want to have
freckle-faced grandchildren ?
How can you make such jokes ?
Let's go to bed !
When I was a small child,
I used to swim here
Here, I fell in love for the first time
Whom with ?
His name was Ofer
We were 13 years old
He was the fastest swimmer
Once, we used a stopwatch to see
how long we can kiss underwater
How long was it ?
36 seconds
- Did you always know that you are....?
- Gay ?
Yeah, more or less
You ?
When I started coming to Tel Aviv....
...I was sure I'll never
be accepted here because.....
....I'm from the other side....
Very soon I realized that
it didn't matter at all
True ! You know....a dick is a dick !
- Have you come out to somebody ?
- Nobody knows at home
Have you told them about me ?
You should be worried more
about my mother's cooking....
I'm joking ! I'm sure they'll love you !
- Hold on !
- What ?
- What's this ?
- Open it !
Roy, this is wonderful !
Look at the back side
of the wristwatch
'Love always finds a Way"
(engraved in arabic)
I asked somebody to translate it for me
Thank you !
How do I look like ?
Stunning !
Come ! Let's go !
-Nimer ! That's a beautiful name
- Thank you !
- Does it mean something in arabic ?
- "Tiger"    (in hebrew = namer)
My parents had a very good friend who
got killed just before I was born
So they named me after him
Really ?
- I didn't know that
- You never asked about my name
Roy told us that you're doing your Master
in Psychology at Tel Aviv University
Excellent faculty !
I'm still a student at the Palestinian
University Bir Zeit
In Tel Aviv I'm just doing a course
A course about psychology
in countries in war conflicts
- Impressive !
- Indeed !
It's very difficult but
it's certainly worth it !
Roy darling, will you help me bring
more things from the kitchen ?
Excuse us !
- Haven't you drunk enough already ?
- It's Ok. Nimer will drive us home
What ?
You wanted to meet my boyfriend, right ?
Couldn't you have informed us,
at least ?
- Why ? Would this change anything ?
- I don't know ?
You know....
I was serving in Ramallah as
a reservist soldier....
....on 13/September/1993....
It was the day that....
...Rabin, Arafat and Clinton shook
hands in front of the White House
We were all very excited....
....with what was happening on that day !
Palestinian kids were coming out of
their houses, giving us olive branches
- How old were you back then ?
- In 1993 ? I was five
Well, then, maybe you remember all that.
Maybe you were amongst the kids who
were giving us olive branches
What are you trying to prove
with these games ?
- What games ?
- Do not pretend !
Ever since you came out, you miss
no opportunity to rub it on our face !
Just because I invited my friend
for a Sabbath dinner ?
It has nothing to do with your friend !
Maybe you won't believe it
but I always support your choices !
Mom, this is my choice !
Will you ever stop waving at us
the Rainbow flag ?
Never !
I'm sorry !
I didn't expect the evening
to be like this
Tell me something.....
Does this make sense to you ?
You mean the two of us ?
Yes
Why ?
What kind of sense are you searching ?
Do you think we're making a mistake ?
I don't know
I don't feel that this is a mistake
You know.....I've done some research...
...and there is this guy....
....who specializes in cases like ours ?
What "cases" exactly ?
Palestinian gay men
What will you do when you finish
your studies here ?
A PhD in Princeton (US)
And what if they don't accept you ?
This is not debatable......
We could.....meet this man......
.....hear what he has to say.....
Even though you're a lawyer
you do not sound very persuasive
- How's your father ?
- Pretty good ! Busy....
-Is he still handling this Goldman case ?
- Yeah, we'll close it in a while
Good, nice !
Well, on our subject.....
Roy told me on the phone that you have
a free movement Pass in Israel
- Yes, a temporary Academic Pass
- OK.....
And your family......
do they know about you ?
Of course not !
I understand !
Look, we know this is
a complicated case...
We just want to know our options about
a residence permit in Israel
Most of the cases that I deal with,
concern young Palestinian men...
Their family kicked them out, they can't
go back there and they're hiding here
-You act for them before the Authoritiies?
- Exactly
What about political asylum here ?
The status of political refugee for them
is no option here
Why ?
It could create a legal precedent.
A "Law of Return" for Palestinians
You were friends with Mustafa, right ?
Yes
- I was very sorry to hear about him
- Thanks
I tried to obtain a temporary
residence permit for him, but.....
...it's time consuming and it includes
house confinement in the meantime....
In short.....it's a mess !
Well, OK....for the time being Nimer
is settled with his Pass...
...and later on we'll see
What "later on" ?
We need to start the process
today already !
Do you really think they give out
passes and free permits just like that ?
- I'm not referring to his Pass
- Roy !
Look ! A few years ago,
things were  much easier...
In the Academic field too !
It's impossible to foresee how quickly
things change for the worse
- What's wrong ?
- A perfect waste of time !
This ? With Daniel ?
- What did you expect he'll tell you ?
- What options we do have or do not have
He could have told us all that
over the phone !
Roy be realistic !
Nimer don't you understand that if we're
not prepared, this will be our reality ?
It's you who doesn't understand !
I live in this shit every single day !!
If I could do anything to change things,
do you think I wouldn't have done it ?
Nimer, I am Israeli. My father has
connections here....there are options
And I know the reality. Even if we
succeed, we won't change the system !
- So, you simply give up on us ?
- I'm not giving up on us !!
So what do you want ?
Do you think I planned
to fall in love with you ?
I only want to be with you.....
I don't want anything more than that.
Nimer Mashrawi ?
Nimer come on in !
Sit !
Thanks for coming. Are you hungry  ?
- No
- Good. Let's go straight to our subject
Your Academic Pass for Israel....
.....has expired !
What does this mean ?
You can't enter Israel any more
What do you want from me ?
-I want you to help me ?
- Help you ?
Listen.....
The Palestinian University Bir Zeit
is very big
Lot's of students and a lot of activity
It won't be difficult for you.....
What do you think ?
You're asking the wrong person
- There's also Nabil Mashrawi...
- What do you want from my brother ?
Nimer.....?
- Do you like living in Tel Aviv ?
- What ?
How will react your family, if they find
out how you spend your nights here ?
How I spend my nights ?
Nimer.......
They will kill you instantly
not just only for being gay....
How long do you think you'll
manage to survive from them....?
.....if  "by chance they suspect"  that
you work for us ?
Nimer, you're not stupid.....
You seem like a decent lad.....
You're not like the rest of the losers
that I handle.....junkies and whores
This is a good deal for both of us
Just a bit of information
for a lot of freedom
Go home and think about it
I'll call you.....
-Hey darling ! Where are you ?
- At my home
- They've revoked my Pass
- How is this possible ? Why ?
Your fucking government does not
want me over there !!
Nimer, tell me what happened ?
Roy, I don't know what to do....
Everything will be alright !
No more course, no more Tel Aviv....
it's all over !
Calm down ! I'm sure there's a mistake
What mistake ? Don't you get it ?
That's it, it's finished !!
Nothing is finished, OK ?
I will never see you again....
Let me look into the matter.....
- I can't really talk right now...
- Wait ! Don't hang up !
- What ?
- I'll take care of that !
I promise you !
I can't think clearly right now
I'll call you later
What the hell are you doing ?
- Take the guns far from our house !
- Don't shout !!
- These are not games !
- Have you lost you mind ?
They know everything ! They might
come here any moment !!
Should I be worried ?
If you haven't talked.....
they know nothing !!
- You ruined our family !
- I....saved our family !!
Remember all the things
you've been through !!
You ruined my life !! My life !!
I'll break your hands next time !
Get lost !!
- You don't understand....
- I had enough of you !!
- I can't stand him anymore !
- He's your brother
Things will get better from now on !
How do you mean ?
Going to this infidel country
was no good for you
- You know what this meant for me.....
- I do...
We'll overcome this together
- I have no one to talk to....
- Don't say that !
I'm goin' in
"Call me asap. The man who loves you"
- I talked to Yossi, as you requested
- And what did he say ?
He can't do anything, this is a
national security matter
What does this mean ?
That they revoked his Pass for
national security reasons
Did you ask what these "reasons" are ?
- That's all he knew....
- Right
-Roy, how well did you know this lad ?
- Dad, cut it out, enough already !
Even going to a prostest, is reason
enough to brand him as "security risk" !
But how did he get a Pass
in the first place ?
Because they wanted him
in the course ? How do I know ?
You'd agree with me though, that
there  is something fishy here
- Do you want a drink ?
- No
Roy, do not forget where you live !
What do you mean ?
-You know what cases we're handling
- So, you're worried about your firm ?
I'm worried about you Roy !!
Do you ever think what you're doing ?
Do you think about your future ?
- Your career ?
-No, I don't think about my career !!
I don't see how you'll succeed in your
job, if you too are branded security risk
Dad, this is my boyfriend that
I'm talking about !!
If you don't want to help me, fine !
Just give me Yossi's number
- Roy, stop acting like a child !
- OK !
- All is cool, dad !
- Roy !
I'll take care of this on my own.
Thank you !
- Hello ?
- It's me....
- Is something wrong ?
- No....I just miss you terribly !
I miss you too !
- What will happen with us ?
- I have no idea
I'm thinking about our problem
all the time
Have you found out anything
about your Pass ?
No
- I think they'll never return it to me
- How do you know that ?
I just know it
I want you to know....
...that no matter what happens,
I love you !
I love you too !
- Hi !
- It's good to see you
We caught a guy who was
hiding in Tel Aviv
-Have you interrogated him ?
-He had this with him !
- Let me see !
- Hold on !
- Do you recognize anybody ?
- The faggot we had caught....
I'm talking about the one
in the background....
You see it with your own eyes....
Does anybody else know ?
Not yet !  But you must act quickly
You can't be sure of what our prisoner
will tell under duress
- Are you alright ?
- Yes......
You take care of that !
- I'm off now....
- Bye !
How are you ?
Why are you crying ?
Why are you all gathered up here ?
You tell us.....why are we all
gathered up here ?
What ?
Enough ! I'm sick of your lies !
All this time in Tel Aviv,
what where you doing there ?
I want to hear it from you !
Answer me !!
What shame have you brought upon
our family ?
You know that I was studying in Tel Aviv
- What's going on ?
- Answer to your mother !
It's the truth ! I was at
professor Stein's course !
Professor Stein ? Professor Shit !
An arse professor !
Were you whispering to him on the phone
under your bed covers ?
- Answer !!
- Let me explain it to you !
It's  not what you think....
Where did you find this
expensive wristwatch ?
Answer !
The watch you've been hiding
in your rucksack....
...and has the engraving about "Love" !!
Whom is it from ?
Why hadn't you shown it to us ?
-It's from a fellow girl student
- Do not lie !!
It's not his fault !!
Haven't you thought about
your own sister Abir, at all ?
- Answer !
- I'm sorry !
If this thing leaks out,
Abir is ruined !
Mom I'm sorry !
Abir you know that I would
never harm you !
-Abir, look at me please !
- Get up !
Get out of our house !!
-Get lost !
- I didn't mean it !
Stop whining ! You brought
shame upon us all !!
- I need you !
- Didn't you hear what mom said ?
- I'm your brother !
- Get out !
- Mom I beg you !
- Out !
- Mom !
- Nabil !
Shut up ! I don't want the neighbours
to hear you !
Get out of the car !
You wait here !
Nabil please !
Do you know what you've done
to our family !
- I didn't mean it !
- Didn't you ? Whore !
-We'll never get rid of our shame !
- I'm sorry !
Nabil ? I'm sorry !
I beg you, don't !
I should had killed you at home !!
How can you say that ?
No ! Don't !
- Do you see this tunnel ?
- Yes
It ends at the other side of the border
Follow it and do not ever
come back here !!
Do you understand ?
If you ever come back,
you'll leave me no other choice.....
Do you understand me ?
- Say you do !!
- I do understand you !
Get inside !
Tell mom.....
Nimer ?
What are you doing here ?
When did you come ?
Are you drunk ?
A little bit.....
What's wrong ?
My family found out....
It will be OK
How are you feeling ?
Terrible !
It's difficult, right ?
Well, here are the forms that
you need to fill in.....
Since your family threw you out and as
you were already a student here....
...we'll apply for a residence permit
in Israel.
But our chances are very slim
OK
Just a minute....
This is time-consumming.....
....and even if he gets the permit it'll
only be for 3, maximum 6 months !!
What will happen afterwards ?
When you needed me to clear your shit
I was good, right ? Give me a break !
Leave it, leave it ! I have another call
Hello ? Yes, residence permit....
I'd like to know how long
it'll take to get one ?
Yes, call me on me cellphone
Thank you very much !
It will be alright !
I promise you !
Israel will not let me stay here....
You'll stay, don't worry !
Shabak took my academic pass
(Shabak = Israel Homeland Security)
OK...
They threatened me that unless I work
for them, they'll out me to my folks
- Why didn't you tell me ?
- It couldn't have changed anything
- Surely it could have changed things !
- My family found out anyway
But why did they pick you up
specifically ?
Because I had a lot to lose
So, there are things that you know ?
- I don't get why Shabak came to you ?
-  How would I know ?
I'm just telling you what happened
They will never let me live here..
Hello ?
Mom ?
I'm sorry I'm late. I just had.....
-Shall we stop for dinner, on the way home?
- No
Let's go home. I shouldn't be out
in the streets anyway
Tomorrow night, after work,
how about.....?
...I bring take-out, we rent a video...
....and we stay home for a quite evening ?
What do you think ?
Let's get out from this country !
What ?
Pack our stuff and get out of here !
Where to ?
Europe, the US, I don't know !
There are Human Rights groups that
can help me
You really do mean that !
I can't see any other solution
-I won't surrender that easily
- Roy, enough already !
It's only a matter of time until
they expel me from Israel
And for many many years I won't
be able to go back to my folks
- Let's just escape from here !
- How will you leave without passport ?
I don't know. But you told me
that your father has connections....
It's not fair what you're asking of me
Roy, all these mafia guys
that you know ?
I can't just get up and leave !
I've nobody left here but you !
I must get out of this place
and you know it !
Roy, please help me !
Help me !
- What happened ?
- They planned to move the arsenal
- Whom have you caught ?
- Mashrawi and two more
-Have you caught his brother, Nimer ?
- Why ? Is he involved too ?
- Where's Nabil ?
- In the yard
Where is Nimer ?
Fuck off !
Where is the faggot ?
Last time I saw him,
he was with you !!
To me, he's dead !
- Search everywhere. I want the brother
- What has happened ?
They know he's gay.
His life is at risk....
-They'll kill him for the family honour
- Keep me posted when you find him
Do you want me to bring you pitta bread ?
(=flat, unleavened bread)
(News on TV: An Israeli soldier was
injured tonight  in Ramallah....)
That's my house in Ramallah !!
- What ?
- My house is on TV
Following info, our security forces found
a large arsenal hidden in a house .....
...and arrested several men wanted
by the Authorities....
When our soldiers were returning to Israel
terrorists opened fire at them and....
Where's the telephone ?
They're not picking up !
Please ! Answer the phone !
What was that about
the hidden arms ?
Nimer ? Nimer !
Talk to me !!
It's all my fault !!
Your fault ? Don't talk nonsense ? How
could you know about the hidden arms ?
Or.....you did know about it ?
And you didn't say anything to me !
- What are you saying ?
- What am I saying ?.....I'm saying....
...that your brothers.....
-......are terrorists
- They are not terrorists !!
- Then how do you call all that ?
- You don't even know them !!
You can't even understand !!
How am I supposed to understand
when you hide such things from me ?
Not now, please !!
Not now ? Do you want me to shut up ?
To sit quietly and accept all this ?
Who are you ? I don't know you at all !!
I can't take it anymore !
I need to leave from this place !
Go !
There's no one holding you here !
- Good evening !
- Good evening !
- Are you Roy Schaefer ?
- Yes
May I help you ?
We're looking for Nimer Mashrawi,
we think he lives here....
You think right, but.....
-...you're late. He's not here anymore
- Not here ?
No
Some time ago, certain people took
back his academic Pass and....
....hence, he returned home. Why
are you looking for him ?
-How do you know he returned home ?
- How do you know he lives here ?
May we enter and take a look around ?
- Don't you need a D.A.'s order for that ?
- Let's call it a "friendly visit" !
Fine, as long as it is a "friendly visit"
come on in.
Thank you !
When was the last time that
you talked to Nimer ?
I'm not sure.....a few days ago ?
Is it important ?
Nice wristwatch !
I have the same
Excellent !
OK, I didn't find anything.
We can go now
If you hear from Nimer,
contact us, whatever the time.....
Is everything in order ?
What happened ?
Don't worry !
Just keep us posted,
if you speak with him
-He wasn't at his boyfriend's home
- Shit !
But the watch he was wearing during
his questioning, was there....
Fine !
The boyfriend is hiding something !
I can't have a fucking Palestinian free,
roaming the streets of Tel Aviv
Gil, listen up !
He can't be far away.
He must be still near this area
Right. I want to close the case
this very night
Issue a search warrant by the Police
And you stay near the lover's house
in case Nimer comes back
- Copy that ?
- Copy !
Hi ! I'm Nimer, leave a message
Hi ! I'm Nimer, leave ......
What ?
What should I do ?
What the fuck should I do ?
Roman is that you ?
I'm sorry I'm calling so late.
This is Roy....
Yes, Roy Schaefer....
I need your help
Unit 613, do you receive ?
Unit 613 is listening
The suspect has been seen in your area
Copy that, we're on our way
Sorry !
Look, this one matches the desciption
Go, go, turn right, right !
Nimer Mashrawi ?
Stop ! This is the police !
We're chasing a suspect
with Mashrawi's description
Alex do you copy ?  Where are you ?
- Roy !
- Nimer, thank God you're here !
I've been calling you and
you never picked up
I am very sorry !
So am I !!
I don't know what happened to me....
I shouldn't have..
Roy it's OK
You know that I would never hurt you.
I should had told you everything
Homeland Security came to my house
looking for you
I thought they would do that
- Don't worry. We're leaving Israel
- What ?
We'll go to the marine. There's a yacht
waiting for you, ready to sail
A yacht ?
- What are you talking about ?
- I did what you wanted.....I did it !
I called Roman, talked to him
and he arranged everything
You're sailing tonight !
- To France, the best option you have
- To France ?
Are you joking ?
- How come France ?
- Roman sends illegal immigrants there
Believe me, I know all his dirty business !
Are you serious ?
You sail tonight. It'll take
5-6 days to arrive....
I'll fly there and wait for you to arrive
You are serious !!
I've never been more serious
in my life !!
We'll go to Human Rights groups
just like you said it...
Nimer....
I'll be there when you arrive !
I won't let you go through all this
on your own, alone !!
- What about your own life ?
- I cannot lose you !
- Shit !!
- What happened ?
- They've followed you ?
- And I brought them straight to you !
-Is there a second exit here ?
- No
Give me your jacket. I'll trick them
and you'll go to the marina
- Out of the question !
- Nimer, there's no other choice !
- Wait two minutes and then leave
- I can't put you in danger !
Forget about me. I'll be fine with them
You need to be onboard that yacht !
I'll see you there in six days
Mashrawi !!
OK ! OK !
Look whom we got here !
- Get in !
- Very amusing !
I see you have a new jacket !
Let's save time for both of us.
Where is your whore ?
Tell me something Roy Schaefer !
Don't we have enough Jewish faggots
here ? You wanted to fuck Arabs ?
Asshole !
You will not catch him !
-He's already far away !
- Far ?
Your daddy bought him a yacht passage ?
Fuck off !!
I'll notify the Coast Guard immediately !
And you'll get what ? Get him killed ?
He has no place to return to !!
Thank you !
You'll mobilize patrol boats, waste
state money..... for what purpose ?
We both know that he's not dangerous
to our national security !!
- Don't tell me what my job is !!
- He's no more your problem !!
He's just a hole, an empty spot
in this case
You already caught his brother, right ?
Nimer is no longer a problem for you,
I give you my word on that !
He's no longer wandering in Tel Aviv,
preparing a hypothetical attack, OK ?
He'll never come back here.....
You can close the Mashrawi case
permanently !
Close the Mashrawi case permanently ??
Should I also thank you for this ?
Schaefer, you crossed our red lines here !
You had to chose between us or them...
and you have chosen them !
I'll bury you alive in a jail !
And this time, neither your dad nor his
connections will be able to help you
I wish you a lovely day !
