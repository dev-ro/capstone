LOVE SONGS
Part One: The Departure
One for ''Pardonnez-moi'', please.
Excuse me, I was just after him.
It's me. I'm seeing a movie.
What are you seeing?
Seriously, what are you seeing?
I'm sick of movies alone.
Julie, I'll be offended
if you see that movie.
Do you love me or not?
That's a dumb question.
You're not alone. Is Alice there?
Not at all. No.
Ismael, I just thought of
something: you piss me off!
Caught you napping?
What?
Is it love or what?
You knock me out, Ismael.
You can read me like an open book.
I'll take back that question!
No, don't say anything, please.
Yes, I'm napping,
undeniably proving I'm in love.
Therefore, you deduce
I'm in love with you
and I resort to daydreams
to avoid expressing it...
I can't hear you clearly.
Get to work!
I want to go home.
- Julie yelled at you?
- Shut up!
- You scare me.
- Julie annoyed you?
Julie asked questions?
I know! She didn't disagree
when you moaned
you were the world's worst fuck?
I'll cut your tongue out.
It'll make life easier.
You'll thank me later, sweetie.
You're not even circumcised!
Why say that?
You're a mini-Jew, in fact.
Kiss my mini-Jew yarmulke
and get to work!
Excuse me, have you got a light?
Your barrage of questions
On the wherefore and why
Of my heart's reasons
Simply finds no reply
I can't deny
I have reasons to love you
I don't see why
The reasons why I love you
So the answer's no
Is it your pretty bum
Could it be fear of loneliness
Sheer luck or am I humdrum
Or is it just laziness
I can't deny
So tell me now
I have reasons to love you
I don't see why
I should let you know
The reasons why you love me so
So the answer's no
My angel sweet
Wants me to sing praises at her feet
Gloria
My holy dove
Demands to hear my song of love
Hallelujah
Is it your scent when you're near
The way you curl under the covers
Maybe it's even your sister dear
Your money or even worse
I can't deny
So tell me now
I have reasons to love you
One lost promise
Two careless words
Three pairs of panties
Left on the floor
Your lips are sour
Your smile sweet
Four pubes in the shower
I'm under your feet
Your mistakes
My professions
My curses
Your transgressions
And then?
After, you dream of before
Everything fades, it's an open book
Just tell me how we look
When we weigh up all we took
Just tell me how we look
Just tell me how we look
Five minutes flat
Not our best
Six pics if that
Of a sex or a breast
Seven calls from your mum
Every hour today
You should answer some
She won't go away
I'd make it better
If I could
Too much hurt
For the good
When you add it all up
Love, you love me how much
Everything fades, it's an open book
Just tell me how we look
When we weigh up all we took
Just tell me how we look
Just tell me how we look
Eight years of love
One Thursday
In my school pack
Your sole letter that day
Nine, will I make it
I can't lie
I know you're mine
But can love die
What memories
Do you have of me
Maybe we'd better
Leave it at that
Come on, tell me
We were too noisy?
It's Alice.
I've got my pyjamas.
Perfect Happiness
Voluptuous Pleasures
Politics
I'm not sure we're in the right order.
Excuse me, Ismael.
You agree, Julie?
Lights out?
Did I take my pill?
You took it.
Which one is it?
Diane 35. Did I take it?
- It suits you?
- Yes...
- The pill makes me depressed.
- It does?
You're on it?
I was but I've bought this thing,
it's like...
It's like a coil.
It replaces the pill, see.
- Why are you on the pill?
- It's not the pill!
Whatever.
You don't sleep with guys.
I'll check anyway.
What sex are you into?
Me? What sex?
I'm into non-sex, you know that.
That's the sex I'm into.
Thanks a lot!
You're different.
You're like my sister.
It's not really sex...
This is sick.
Why are people so against egoism?
Egoism can be moral.
That's really sick!
You should be guiding me.
We were supposed to sleep, remember.
I really think you're very pretty.
I'm not sure you really thinking that
reassures me.
You think you could?
What?
Tell me you love me a little.
Do you love me?
Are you in love with me?
No, I don't love you.
You don't love me?
Of course I love you!
Except that I...
Screw you!
That's pathetic.
It's pitiful.
By staying with you, am I supporting
something that sickens me?
This soppiness...
You started, with your non-sex.
Non-sex isn't an open door
to such idyllic romanticism!
I'm anything but romantic.
You're anything but what you say.
Anything but a boss, a Jew...
Give me a break!
I never laid claim to being Jewish.
I can't even locate Tel Aviv
on a map of Palestine!
You start with mad joy.
Concentrate.
Tranquillity.
Surprise.
And?
That's not surprise. What is it?
- What is it, Julie? Help us.
- No idea.
Amazement!
Sorrow.
Sorrow, far from moderate.
Despondency, Dad.
Yes, despondency.
Fear.
More than fear...
- Dread.
- No, watch.
Terror?
Not terror? What then?
It's horror.
Well done, Jasmine.
Despair?
In other words, I take him
from joy to despair.
Thanks a lot.
Ismael annoys you a little?
Yeah, he annoys me a lot.
Have you seen Cedric again?
I suppose you could say that.
He's married. He'll never leave her.
I know that.
Maybe when his kid
changes schools in two years.
Unless the idiot repeats a year.
What's going on, Julie?
We're involved in a dumb scene
and Ismael's useless.
So what else is new?
He's forcing me
to break up for him.
You're leaving him?
Not break up with him...
We've started this threesome and...
the third person's taking root.
Who is it?
It's a girl.
Alice.
Was that Ismael's idea?
No, it was mine.
I'm into threesomes.
Jeanne, let me help Julie.
To do what?
Let me, okay.
You're needed in there.
Go and sit down.
No arguing.
Don't let dad drink too much.
What's going on?
It's really complicated.
A threesome with Ismael?
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
I didn't need to, I guess.
How long have you been three?
A few weeks.
A month.
A month?!
- I don't want to pry...
- So don't pry.
I'm surprised in any case.
So is this threesome over or not?
Nearly.
Does this Alice have your key?
Mum...
You were spying!
What's it like?
Sorry, I shouldn't ask that.
I don't mind.
So what's it like?
Weird, okay.
And it's hard to sleep.
All three of you sleep together?
And it's hard to sleep?
Yes, Alice has nightmares.
That can't be easy.
And she's in the middle...
We shouldn't talk about this.
I agree,
but we are talking about it.
I am quite intrigued.
Only natural, Mum.
I don't get it...
This Alice,
is she for Ismael or for you?
For both of us.
Both of you?
Not together?
Yes, sometimes.
But it's tricky.
It takes effort.
Yes, of course.
I can believe that.
Did it come naturally?
What? The sex?
Yes, the positions...
I...
Did you know
where to put yourself naturally?
That's the easy part.
How do you decide?
On what?
Well, do you talk about it first or...
No, not really. It just happens.
It's not embarrassing?
No, not at all.
I thought it'd be complicated.
It's tricky enough for two as it is.
- Had you done it with a girl before?
- Me? No.
Do you like it?
It's weird. It's...
It's funny. It's different.
But Alice likes it!
I'm not answering that.
We've talked enough.
Yes. Thank you, sweetheart.
It's good to confide
in your mum, baby.
The cake's going to burn!
I want you to know
I'm still in love with Ismael.
You do it to make him happy?
Bring the cups.
Ismael's doing his cushion thing.
Not so loud. He just dropped off.
The jerk does it well.
Let's go and see Jeanne now.
Let's see Auntie Jeanne.
Do a little burp for Auntie Jeanne.
Dirty bugger!
Are you crazy?
I loved that cushion!
I'll get it.
Cut the cake first.
You'll only say we cheated after.
Who's going to hide?
For God's sake, Dad!
My little sweetie-pie...
''Who's this piece for?''
That's not very funny, Dad.
She doesn't want to.
Come and give your dad a kiss.
Now close your eyes.
Who's this piece for?
For Mum.
Make room for me.
Give your old father a cuddle...
Move up a bit.
There's no room.
You too.
- Mum, take a photo.
- Not now...
This is so embarrassing.
I'll get the cushion.
Jealous...
I thought Ismael worked Sundays.
He still does. Every other Sunday.
Why are we doing the dishes?
The washer's dead.
I mean why are we cleaning up
for the men?
It pisses me off!
We ate too, Julie.
Doesn't Dad ever do a thing?
He's revising.
That degree's a joke, Mum!
He'll never sit the exams.
I'm not so sure.
He'll do it just to piss me off.
The rain falls without a care
On the angel of the Bastille Square
The sky is so grey up there
As the rain's needles pierce the air
The rain falls without a care
The grey clouds, heavy and solemn
Bring water for Paris so fair
For the naked angel on its column
Nothing moves on the street
Outside the window pane
Paris seems draped in a sheet
Bathed in drops of rain
Against the broken sky
The angel spreads its wings
I'd love you till goodbye
In this rain and all it brings
Shit!
I'll go.
Rain falls again without a care
On the angel of the Bastille Square
A pot of tea that we share
In the camomile Sunday air
The rain pours down without a care
Who'd have thought a drop of rain
Would make people flee the square
Leaving the angel to its disdain
Nothing moves on the street
Outside the window pane
Paris seems draped in a sheet
Bathed in drops of rain
Against the broken sky
The angel spreads its wings
I'd love you till goodbye
In this rain and all it brings
The rain still falls without a care
On the angel of the Bastille Square
An early night we both share
In sheets free of wear and tear
The rain falls without a care
Over family meals we have to bear
The angel in the floodlight's glare
Spreads its wings on the Bastille Square
You bought a new ring?
I gave it to her.
That's a serious breach of contract.
- What contract?
- The gentleman's one.
- No rings for my wife.
- I'm not your wife!
I know what you're up to.
You think
I can't figure out your plan?
You'll eliminate me by beguiling me
with your kisses...
What do you mean?
This is no three-ring circus.
With me as your horse?
A real gift-horse.
With your heart.
And your teeth.
You're sure?
Touching her means fucking me.
You're sick!
Send in the clowns...
I don't want to go.
We won't stay long.
Slowly...
Watch the cars.
Look out!
Thank you.
I know your game
You think you've won
Your cake and the baker's dame
Two for the price of one
Little bitch, that's so cheap
It makes a nasty sound
Your jealousy won't make me weep
After all, you sleep around
I'm the bridge between your banks
Running from side to side
Cross over and give me thanks
Kiss and let me be your guide
I love no one but you
I love no one but you
Little shit, you think you're so swell
I smelled your fingers, swine
Where did they get that odd smell
It's definitely not mine
Little bitch, go to hell
You're just as bad as me
In adultery you dwell
She touches you, I see
I'm the bridge between your banks
Running from side to side
Climb on top, I'll say thanks
Why not give me a ride
I love no one but you
Little shit, make your choice
We'll be two, no longer three
That's all over, let's rejoice
Come on, it's her or me
Little bitch, I'll make my choice
You know better than all of us
Let's hear your pretty voice
In this circus
I'm the bridge between your banks
Your quarrels leave me cold
Trample me and rub my flanks
I'll stay here and grow old
I love no one but you
Paris is already so far away
Paris so petty and petit
We'll be happy every day
Enveloped in the city
Who cares anyway
If it's raining at JFK
I'm scared during landing
But you hold my hand tight
Like a kid so understanding
I wept there in my plight
Who cares anyway
As long as with you I stay
Crossing from the Brooklyn side
Touch my hands.
My love so sweet and mild
I'll be right back.
Was laughing happily, wide-eyed
Like a happy child
April brings Manhattan
Sunshine and blue skies
Like an eternity in satin...
- His name's Gwendal.
- I don't care.
Who cares anyway
I'll get Julie.
If the wind carries your scarf away
As Broadway turns on the heat
We're dancing on the rooftop
Of 218 Adam Street
You're my Liza and I'm your Bob
Excuse me.
You're here?
I don't feel good.
I'm going home.
- Stay if you want.
- Are you crazy? Come on.
Let's go home.
Just a second.
Where did I put the damn stub?
Got it.
You fetch it. I'll go on up.
We can't go out.
- Stay inside.
- That's my girlfriend.
What's going on?
Julie. Stand back.
Good evening.
I called because a lady collapsed.
This is her boyfriend.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie. Julie Pommeraye.
P-O-double M
E-R-A-Y-E.
And your relationship to her?
I'm her boyfriend.
- And you are?
- Ismael.
Benoliel.
B-E-N-O
L-I-E-L.
Were you here when it happened?
A young woman, 28,
heart and respiratory arrest.
GCS 3.
I'm fitting the scope.
Hook up the drip.
The sat rate is 95 for now.
During the concert,
she felt faint,
she went to the bathroom.
I joined her.
I went to get our things.
When I joined her outside...
she was lying on the ground.
Did you consume alcohol?
Did you use drugs?
How long were you apart?
I don't know. Two minutes.
Would you mind
waiting in the car, please?
Take her shoulders.
Watch the gear.
When you're ready. Head to foot.
Shoulders ready.
Prepare to lift. Lift.
Prepare to lift.
Lift.
200 joules loaded. Step back.
Watch out for the charge.
Charge!
No pulse. No pulse at all.
She's in total AV block.
No reaction at all?
Forget the bicarb,
prep a shot of adrenalin. 20 mg.
Carry on ventilating.
Keep her on manual.
- Still no pulse.
- One more charge.
Prep another shot.
I'm the doctor.
TN 10, 10 Quebec Foxtrot.
Delta Oscar Sierra
for 59, rue du Chateau d'Eau.
My final tune just began
My last song along this road
A single for a single man
My terror summed up in a code
Delta Oscar Sierra
The police code like a breath
Delta Oscar Sierra
The song of approaching death
It's Ismael.
This song of mine's a real must
But you fall before it passes
It's all dust to dust
A mean little mound of ashes
Delta Oscar Sierra
The flashing of the ambulance
Delta Oscar Sierra
The song of death's dance
Your father says you're asleep
Your mother wants to touch your brow
The wood around you makes us weep
And tells us now that you're now...
Delta Oscar Sierra
You dance against the walls
Delta Oscar Sierra
As death calls
Do you need help?
Delta Oscar Sierra
The police code like a breath
Where did I put it?
My book...
The song of approaching death
Delta Oscar Sierra
The flashing of the ambulance
The Night Stirs
Many people have a soul
that loves to swim.
They are commonly known as lazy.''
Part Two: The Absence
Ismael.
Okay?
Going to my place?
Of course.
Why didn't you let me know?
I left a hundred messages.
I know but my phone is...
out of order.
I'm going to the paper.
I've taken half a day off work.
Let's do it now.
I can't!
Give me the keys. I'll do it.
The place is a mess.
- Put them in the mailbox.
- I won't snoop.
Of course you will.
The sandwich in the fridge...
Don't throw it out. Or eat it.
First insert, Sarkozy's son's scooter.
Three suspects arrested...
Are you listening?
Arrested has an ''r'' missing,
third line.
DNA, there's an extra space.
Last line, after ''policeman'',
add an exclamation mark.
You're not the materialistic type,
are you?
No.
Clothes and stuff
don't really matter to you.
Is this some twisted way
to say I have no dress sense?
No, it's a ploy.
You won't see
stuff left at my place again.
- What have you done?
- Nothing.
Jeanne's gathering Julie's clothes
for a bonfire.
Shit, what a bummer!
I told you 20 times.
You confiscated my key.
But I spend all day there.
- Couldn't you sort my stuff?
- I open a closet, I break down.
- So sorting things...
- If only you could break down.
- Open the closets. Wide!
- Shut up...
I can help you.
You can help me too.
Leave me be.
I can see you're bothered
but I don't love Gwendal yet.
I don't love you either,
so calm down.
But I need you. You're surprised?
Be quiet
You've said so much
nothing surprises me now
We make
A silent promise, a speechless vow
The words
In excess
We must
Be quiet
Our tongues are weary, let them rest
To have
Tongue to tongue
A dialogue of the deaf
Sometimes
Believe me
We must
Be quiet
Keep your saliva as an antidote
Let it
Trickle like sweet venom down my throat
The words
In excess
We must
Be quiet
Our lips are dry
and our mouths don't need
To get
Caught up in the words
Of this play we read
Sometimes
Believe me
We must
Be quiet
At last
Be quiet
In the end...
It's my kid brother's.
- He's a clean guy.
- Not with the dishes!
For the remotes...
You have cable, TV and DVD.
There are earphones if you want.
For the PlayStation,
unplug the lead.
Thanks.
Good night.
It's you then?
What is?
The draught...
Sorry.
It's not a problem.
But since we haven't paid the gas bill,
we sleep with the window closed.
You don't like my sleeping bag?
It's fine, but I can't sleep
so I'm not using it.
Yeah, I know. I was told.
Whatever you were told,
I can be alone.
It's six o'clock.
Usually, I get up at seven.
I'll make us some coffee.
Why get up so early?
To go to school.
Shit...
The bastards.
It's too early for their crap.
My name's Erwann.
Shit, the bastards,
they're all Bretons.
You said it.
Shelves full of Anatole Le Braz,
crepes every Monday night
and our motto: ''Treat a sailor well
and he'll shit in your hand.''
Very nice...
Isn't it?
Unfortunately, the buds are out.
A lot of maples are opening out.
The Japanese roses are in flower...
A frost will kill them.
To avoid that, go out to the garden
and prune all these tiny branches...
Morning TV is bad
for your mental health.
Use my room.
It's the first on the left.
The sheets are clean.
Sleep well.
Thanks!
- Okay?
- My day's off to a good start.
How do you experience things
before 8 AM?
It'll be a glorious day.
Done your English?
No, but I've read Aragon.
''Le Cri du butor''.
Don't spoil it!
It will be a glorious day
Unnatural weather
Like a painterly sky
Weather strong as a woman
Weather to sell your soul
It will be a glorious day
Weather to laugh and run
Weather to stay alive
To fear the worst
Stop it! For pity's sake, stop!
On the banks of the Seine
Young people at midday
Michel with Madeleine
Pierre with Jeanne and Germaine
Who walks with Jean
If the sky is full of birds
What do you care
The fire that burns in hell
Where are you going
The swallows ask
Is April here at last
Paparazzi!
You're the first guy
to sleep in my bed.
I am?
I got you some...
some... from the bakery.
Croissants?
Not croissants, raisin buns.
They're better with tea.
- Tea? What time is it?
- 5:15 PM.
No time to stop off at home.
Is Alice here?
No, there's no one here.
- I can lend you clean clothes.
- Yes, please.
I smell a bit funky.
What?
Very Breton.
Give me a break.
Can you lock up?
- Good night.
- Good night, Yvette.
Good night, Alice.
You know, Alice...
Julie's parents
have had the autopsy results.
And?
It was cardiac arrest.
A small blood clot lodged itself
in an artery.
Nothing caused it.
It's like a cot death.
Let's have a drink.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Okay, see you.
If you can't sleep, call me.
You will?
You promise?
Stop freaking me out.
- Hi!
- Shit, are you crazy?
You finish late.
Why are you here?
This is my neighbourhood too.
Posters for Communist Workers?
Exactly.
What do you want?
Nothing. I just came to say hi.
At three in the morning?
If I'm a pain, I'll go.
You're not a pain
but how did you find me?
I don't really know.
I'm going.
To your place? Can I come?
No.
Should I insist?
Wait at your office tomorrow?
I'm sorry, Erwann. No.
You have no doubts?
You don't need anyone?
Did I ask you anything?
Okay, I'm splitting.
Why are you here?
I was worried.
You didn't come home last night.
You're not my mother.
You could have called.
I left messages.
You spoke to my parents?
You heard about the autopsy?
- You slept here yesterday?
- Yes.
Don't you have a home?
I thought we could help each other.
Support each other.
Together.
It's just as hard for me, Ismael.
You could make an effort.
An effort how?
Respect my sorrow.
- You respect me, moving in here?
- It was my sister's place too.
What's the dog doing here?
I was scared here alone
so Mum let me borrow her.
Got a light?
You got the issue finished?
Sorry, I can't go on like this.
I just can't.
I'm not interested.
It doesn't help.
Have Julie's keys.
I'll take mine and say good night.
No questions.
Give me the door code.
7 A20.
Make yourself at home.
You're working late, young man.
I'm not working.
What's a Breton library like?
The Beautiful Room Is Empty
This isn't on the programme.
Mad About Vincent
Don't mix them up.
Salinger though...
Have you ever loved
For the sheer sake of it
Have you ever taken
A bite of the apple
For the taste of the fruit
Its sweetness and its zest
Have you often lost your way
Yes, I've already loved
For the sheer sake of it
But the apple was hard
And I cracked a tooth
Those unripe passions
Those indigestible loves
Often made me feel sick
But a true love that lasts
Leaves lovers exhausted
And their overripe kisses
Rot on our tongues
But fleeting love affairs
Know such futile fevers
And their kisses so green
Chafe against our lips
For if you wish to love
For the sheer sake of it
The worm in the apple
Can slip between our teeth
It eats away at our heart
Our brain and all the rest
Slowly bleeding us dry
But when we dare to love
For the sheer sake of it
This worm in the apple
That slips between our teeth
Can make our heart fragrant
Our brain too and leave us
Its perfume inside us
But fleeting love affairs
See such futile efforts
Their passing caresses
Can wear out our bodies
But a true love that lasts
Makes the lovers less fine
Often the test of time
Gets the better of us
Time for bed, you runt.
It's only 4 AM, it's not late.
Tomorrow morning at 7,
you have mathematics,
chemistry, algebra...
I can sleep in the lounge.
Make yourself at home.
Okay.
I took Scarlett
to the Pepiniere Park yesterday.
I hadn't been back since Julie died.
It was our park.
You took us there when we were kids.
It's good you were able
to go back there.
I think so, yes.
Right...
Shall I make my salad?
Anyone for cheese?
No, thanks.
I'll have some salad.
Help me make it.
I'm not doing it for one.
Jasmine, no hysterics...
You're crazy.
Ismael, since we're all here,
I want to tell you
that Mireille and I
want you to have Julie's money.
There's not much
on the current account
but there are savings
on two other accounts.
I don't know if Julie told you...
but, after she was hired permanently,
her salary included life insurance.
We've asked for it to be paid to you.
There.
All in all, it should amount
to 20,000 euros.
No, thank you.
I don't want the money. Sorry.
No one wants the money.
It should go to the guy who needs it.
I didn't pay for the funeral.
It wasn't up to you to pay.
Haven't you got
any revision to do today?
Is this a new resolution
to help your mum with the dishes?
Xmas is over. You still have hope?
Has someone mentioned driving lessons
in this family?
And the old sister here...
Got anything to say?
Anything at all?
A bit jealous, is she?
Were you offered
driving lessons at 20?
Look at me when I speak!
Look at me when I speak!
Look at me.
And give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Because I love you.
I've loved you for ages.
Disgusting...
I'm glad you're okay.
It helps us all.
My eyes gaze
At the sky
The white clouds against perfect blue
No sign of God
In the sky
Slow clouds in the broken blue
Sunlight floods
The sky
My winter days
are spent forgetting you
And every second
Is a fistful of soil
Every minute
Is like a sob
See how hard I fight
See how much I lose
In blood and tears
In blood and tears
I hurl up
At the sky
Those pebbles that you painted green
But there's no reply
From the sky
No rebound on the sea's glassy sheen
Sunlight floods
The sky
My days in hell spent burying you
And every second
Is a fistful of soil
Every minute
Is like a tomb
See how hard I fight
See how much I lose
In blood and tears
In blood and tears
I hope
That in the sky
Sly little devils
The angels' wings will bend
So that you will fall
From the sky
To my arms,
Iike a gift, a true godsend
But every second
Is a fistful of soil
But every second
Is a fistful of soil
Every minute
Is like a tomb
See how hard I fight
See how much I lose
In blood and tears
In blood and tears
Maud...
Can you give me... a shot of vodka?
With your lamb curry?
Wake up...
There's someone here.
Hi, Ismael. It's past midday.
It's okay.
What are you doing?
Any coffee left?
I'm Julie's sister.
Julie's sister?
You're Alice?
No...
Work.
What are you doing?
- I came to see you. Where are you?
- Behind you.
Don't you have classes,
revision, essays?
The best thing I can do
is wait for you.
That's kind. You're sweet.
But I'm like a huge mystery for you.
You have no idea.
What does that mean?
It means you don't know me
and shouldn't wait for me.
The mystery of your weary gaze
A mystery that keeps you in a haze
The secret of this daze
Secrets are my true craze
This barrier between you and me
This barrier, who holds the key
Cross the border, leave your daze
Stand on your land, see my gaze
You need to advance
To cover the distance
Between you and me
You'll have to be bold
If you want to hold
Onto me
A chill grips your land these days
What to do in this winter maze
You're caught up an icy daze
Everything's frozen
Start a blaze
You need to advance
To cover the distance
Between you and me
You'll have to be bold
If you want to hold
Onto me
The mystery of your weary gaze
A mystery I try to appraise
The cheap mystery of your daze
Doesn't need your arms these days
Asshole!
Gwendal sent his brother?
- What did he say?
- It's not about you.
C'mon, I'm not stupid.
He sends his brother to lecture me.
He wants to move me.
I dumped him. Badly.
The guy's an emotional psychopath!
Gwendal's great.
He's already corrupted you!
I swear, the guy scares me.
- Gwendal?
- I don't want to see him again!
Give the keys to his little brother.
I'd been warned.
Bretons are dangerous.
Especially in love!
Here.
- No way...
- He'll send Erwann back.
Give them to him when you see him.
What?
Nothing.
- What's up?
- They just changed the front page.
New trainers?
- Like them?
- No, they're ugly.
Well, well...
I gave Ismael the keys.
You can keep the stuff I left,
it's okay.
Tell your brother sorry from me.
Want a ride home?
- Want a ride home?
- I'm okay.
You're sure?
See you.
Part Three: The Return
Hey you
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's a lie
And we stand no chance
Life is so sad
Tell me that you love me
Good evening.
I have to sit outside with the dog.
It's so late.
I waited till my husband dozed off.
That's okay.
I only just left work.
You didn't tell Ismael you were coming?
Jeanne searched his things
to get your number.
Something to drink?
No, I'm okay. Thank you.
Ismael told me
about the autopsy results.
Why did he tell you?
Is that important for him?
I think so.
It's important to understand.
I'm not so sure.
We expect doctors
to clear up every mystery,
to unearth the secrets
that explain them...
I reject that illusion.
Mystery is part of life.
And it merely adds to the horror
of Julie's death.
But that's not why I called.
It may sound silly but I'd like you
to take care of Ismael.
I'd like you to watch over him.
I'm asking you that.
I called because I heard
you'd moved out.
I'm worried. He's all alone.
He's not alone.
I see him every day.
And emotionally?
Emotionally what?
Are you still together?
That's a really weird question.
I only wish him well.
I believe you.
But I don't think you can help people
if they don't want that.
What are you doing here?
Dad sent me.
He woke up?
You weren't there so he woke me.
I'm only here...
I told him you'd taken Scarlett out.
I'm sorry. Alice.
Go on.
Thank you so much for coming here.
We're counting on you.
You're one of the family.
Can I give you a kiss?
Coming?
I'll give you ten minutes
to yell at each other first.
Can I sit down?
Got a cigarette?
My exams are stressing me out.
Want to keep the pack?
No, I have to sleep.
I mustn't smoke all night.
Don't take this badly, okay.
Look on it as kindness on my behalf.
I don't thinkyou're one of the family.
Thank you.
I don't think you need to be
one of the family to feel grief.
Okay.
Are you getting over it?
No.
Objectively,
I'm not getting over it at all.
And you?
A little.
I think so.
I'll be going.
See you.
Wash
My soiled memory in its muddy stream
With your tongue's tip lick me clean
And remove every single trace
Of what has been
Of what binds me
Of what comes to pass
Alas
Stalk
Hunt her down for within me she fights
And when you have her in your sights
Do not heed her pleas and cries
You know
That she has to die
This is her second demise
And so
Kill her
Again
Weep
I've done that before, all in vain
More sobs just wet the pillows again
Despite my tries
Despite my tries
I have
A dried up heart
And swollen eyes
I have
A dried up heart
And swollen eyes
So burn
Burn when you sink into my bed of ice
It melts when you hug me like a vice
There's no more sorrow
No more gravity
If I have
Your body like a flow
Of lava washing over me
My soiled memory in its muddy stream
Wash
Did Scarlett wake you?
I've brought croissants.
What's going on?
I don't think
I can offer you breakfast.
Shit...
Can we talk?
I don't have much to say.
So let's walk. We're on a street.
No one will criticize us.
- I'm not criticizing you.
- That's not what I meant.
We deal with grief the way we can.
I'm not judging you.
But your way is a bit violent.
- You're judging me.
- I'm trying to understand.
Understand what?
What went on between Julie and you.
That's a challenge. A real challenge.
Understand...
why you never wanted kids...
why you were in a threesome...
my sister's life before she died.
And a boy in my bed
explains everything, is that it?
You have the right handbook.
You're lucky.
She must have had reasons
to be unhappy.
I won't say anything.
It's for the best, right?
No, it's not for the best.
No one stops you speaking.
Far from it.
People need to hear you.
My parents especially. Talk to them.
- To say what?
- I don't know. What you feel...
Give me a break.
I already have parents of my own.
You're so self-centred.
You're ungrateful, selfish...
Sure, I'm thoughtless, I'm idiotic...
And I'm a faggot on top of it.
It's terrible...
That's not what I said.
Don't make me look like a dumb bitch!
The same winter sun
The same snapping twigs
Icy fingertips
Frost on the railings
The same smell of soil
Of earth gone to earth
It'll all be there
It'll all be there
Except for you
The Pepiniere Park at the week's end
One more hour, one more hour if that
One more hour before nightfall
The same temperature
Down to freezing point
Melancholy beasts
At the gates of the zoo
The same hurried parents,
their children wrapped up warm
It'll all be there
It'll all be there
Except for you
The Pepiniere Park at the week's end
One more hour, one more hour if that
One more hour before nightfall
Even if I stay
And walk where we walked
Follow the same paths
At the same time of day
Even if I'm the same
Even if I'm beautiful
It'll all be there
It'll all be there
Except for you
The Pepiniere Park at the week's end
One more hour, one more hour if that
One more hour before nightfall
Night will fall
And then
Nothing more
Good luck.
Hi, you're back?
Your brother sent you?
Tell him to stop, it's a real drag.
I'm looking for Ismael.
- Gwendal didn't send you?
- No.
He didn't tell you we split up?
No. But I noticed.
- He's seeing someone?
- Yes. Where's Ismael?
He's got a nerve.
No, I don't know.
But I'd like him to help
with the layout.
- He's not answering his phone.
- I know.
- You're not worried?
- Should I be?
I like Bloc Party too.
What's going on, Erwann?
I hoped he'd be here.
Why do you want Ismael?
I won't hurt him. I'll go.
I have a mock exam tomorrow. Bye.
Tell me something...
This may sound crazy
but I just thought of it.
Are you and Ismael together?
I hope so.
See you.
See you!
The dirty devil...
Why have you come so late
Couldn't you cope
I'd decided not to wait
I'd given up hope
Why have you come so late
What brings you here
What bizarre twist of fate
What sudden desire or fear
Why have you come so late
Didn't your mother say, dear
You shouldn't arrive late
For an invitation sincere
Without flowers, fine
But it's only polite
To arrive on time
When time is tight
Why have you come so late
When it's all over and said
And your brand new date
Takes my place in your bed
Why have you come so late
You don't have an excuse
No story to relate
No way to make a truce
Why have you come so late
I can't, try as I might
The tales you create
Of a future bright
Where for now it's not so late
My angel, it's all so bizarre
If you could face your fate
You'd see how much older we are
BRITTANY
Hey there, kid, all day long
I've sung an idiot's song
You kept us waiting...
Crawling in the gutter's flow
From Montparnasse to Chateau d'Eau
Are you okay?
One drink after another,
God knows where
I'm melancholy.
Zubrowska, Riesling and Piper
At a loss, not knowing what to do
I've come back here to find you
I run to your arms
To get off the streets
Any noise, I'll kill you.
The delight of your charms
In your soft, warm sheets
But, alas, instead of that
I thought I heard
''I love you''
That's his problem, true
I thought I heard
''I love you''
That's his problem, true
So what if you do believe
So what if I can't be naive
However lost I may be
None of that between you and me
You want a body, that's okay
A pair of arms, why not
In my bed you can stay
Getting the sheets in a knot
But if you want to have all that
You need to hear
''I love you''
You need to hear
''I love you''
I'm old, a widower and sectarian
A poor, idiotic vulgarian
I'm handsome, young and Breton
I smell of rain, the ocean
and crepes with lemon
Be quiet now, you little jewel
Once again you're wrong, you fool
I'm precious if you save me, see
Okay, but none of that
between you and me
You want a body, that's okay
To get off the streets
In my bed you can stay
In your soft, warm sheets
But if you want to have all that
You need to hear...
Love me less
but love me a long time.
