Now, the Book of
Revelation tells us
the Rapture is the literal,
physical
bodily coming of
Christ in the clouds
to snatch out of this
world all believers,
the dead and living
who were in
Christ our Lord, amen.
Those sinners
who remain on Earth
shall face torments and suffer
beyond their
wildest nightmares.
Who are these people?
Well, we all know them.
Musicians,
gays, gay musicians,
the entire 1997
Denver Broncos,
and all of Hollywood.
LINDSEY:  Um,
it was incredibly freaky,
to me, anyway.
I always say that Ben
sort of saved the world.
He's that amazing.
Well, he says that
I saved the world,
but he's probably
just being nice.
It doesn't matter.
That's me,
looking fairly shocked.
But honestly,
not that shocked,
because the truth is,
a lot of crazy stuff
had already gone down.
Wow.
Maybe I should
back up a little.
See, it all started
with the Rapture.
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)
It was league night.
I had just gotten a strike.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God!
And Ben was even
more excited than me.
He usually is.
Which is why I love him.
Anyway, um...
Then, all of a sudden,
half the world was
totally gone.
(BLUES SONG PLAYING)
LINDSEY:  The people who went
to church and prayed
and missed out on
a lot of fun stuff
got sucked
straight up to Heaven.
And the rest of us,
well, we were screwed.
We weren't believers,
so I guess that's
why we weren't taken.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(SIREN WAILING)
Both my mom and Ben's mom
went to church religiously.
Well, that's the only way
you can go to church.
The point is,
they both got raptured.
(WHOOSHES)
But, in the only recorded case
of such a thing happening,
my mother was sent
back the very next day.
Mom?
Oh.
Laura.
(STUTTERS)
What happened?
I don't know.
I was in Heaven.
CLARK: Wait.
You got sent back?
So God, like,
returned you?
(SOBS) Well.
I guess so. Yes.
Aw!
I was just in line.
Uh-huh.
And they were
giving out massages.
And a guy
butt in front of me.
He probably
didn't butt.
He barged right
in front of me,
and he said,
"I need something
in the shoulder."
Were you in the
right line?
I was in the right line.
Honey, you are almost
never in the right line.
Listen to me.
It was unprofessional.
It was poorly organized.
You have this backwards.
You go up there to be judged.
You don't do the judging.
(WAILING)
Mom. Aw!
(SOBBING)
I don't want to be here.
I'd hug you,
but you smell like shit.
Did anybody vacuum
while I was gone?
We all vacuumed.
(CONTINUES WAILING)
We all vacuumed
all the time.
Lots of vacuuming.
LINDSEY:  And then
the torments started.
First came these
little locusty things.
(CRUNCHING)
Ow!
(GRUNTS)
I hate those little things.
Suffer! Suffer!
I am suffering,
you little buttwipe!
Suffer!
You're not going anywhere,
you little fucker!
If you're wondering,
they were impervious
to most bug sprays.
(INSECT YELLING) Suffer!
(SCREAMING)
I got an idea!
How about you suffer?
Suffer!
Suffer!
MR. LEWIS: (YELLING)
This apocalypse is killing me!
MRS. LEWIS: (CRYING)
Why? Why?
I don't know why,
you Jesus freak!
Why don't you ask God?
Oh, yeah, I forgot!
He doesn't like you!
That's my parents,
you guys.
I can't stand it
any longer!
Good times.
Then God,
in his infinite wisdom,
did this really gross thing.
It just seemed so unsanitary,
you know?
What is that?
Is that...
I think it's raining blood.
Blood? It's raining blood.
That's not disgusting.
What the fuck is
the point of that?
There's no point!
I know.
Wipers don't work for shit.
Try the sprayer thing.
Sprayer thing.
Well, that's great.
Now it's all smeared.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The wraiths showed up
about a year ago.
They went all around the world
wrecking everything,
and killing people.
Holy cow!
Monsters, man.
Real monsters.
Without the costumes.
Because the costumes
are real, you know.
LINDSEY:  So, a lot of people
died during the apocalypse.
The only one I know who
came back was my neighbor!
Mr. Murphy.
(GRUMBLING)
We all thought
it was weird that
instead of chasing us around,
trying to eat our
delicious brains,
all he did was mow his lawn.
Maybe it was on his
mind when he died.
Uh, I don't know.
(GRUMBLING)
Finally this neighbor
got so sick of it
that he stole the mower.
But then Mr. Murphy
just walked around
without the mower.
This is sad.
Hello, Mr. Murphy.
(GRUMBLES)
Your lawn looks
really nice.
Have a good day,
Mr. Murphy.
And just as
the Bible predicted,
the Antichrist
finally showed up.
Nobody thought his name
would be Earl Gundy, though.
Certainly not that
he'd be from Idaho.
I might take you
to rock bottom,
but I'm going to
bring you back up...
And I guess not
really a surprise
that the Antichrist
was a politician first.
...because I'm Earl Gundy,
and we can make it.
And then he gets
invited to the White House.
He poisons
everyone's sandwiches,
and then just
starts using our missiles
NEWSCASTER:  ...evacuation of
Chicago has not been
fast enough.
LINDSEY:  He blew up
a bunch of cities.
Chicago, Tokyo, London.
You know, just to make
everybody scared of him.
NEWSCASTER:  We go now
to Orlando.
(EXPLOSION)
MR. LEWIS: Oh, come on!
Not Orlando!
Oh, man! Come on!
Think of all
those ride operators.
They're just kids!
LINDSEY:  Oh, and he makes
everyone call him "The Beast,"
because he thinks it
makes him sound cool.
Everyone thought
he was going to live
in some palace in
the Middle-East,
but he settled right here.
In my home town.
Not biblically referenced,
Seattle.
Overall, I'd say
the Book of Revelation's
got most of what has happened
pretty much right.
There were some
things that happened
that weren't predicted.
Like the foul-mouthed crows,
for instance.
Strawberry jam.
Oh, nice.
That's right.
CROW: Hey, you!
Yeah, you.
Fuck you! Caw!
Ben, baby,
just ignore that.
Man, I hate those guys.
I mean, why do we
just let them
insult us like this?
I know.
Eat shit, fucker.
Hold on.
No. Mmm-mmm.
Not worth it.
Hey! Blow me!
And don't forget
my balls. Caw!
Yeah, don't forget my balls,
you stupid crow.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
It's not worth it.
Yeah! Walk away, pussy!
Caw!
Felch me! Caw!
I just don't think that that
bird knows what he's saying.
Yeah.
It's just a noise
coming out of their mouth.
(CROW CAWING)
Fuck them!
No, no, no.
CROW: Fuck, fuck, fuck! Caw!
LINDSEY:  Ben and I had
this idea of starting
our own sandwich cart.
Because people appreciate
a good sandwich,
even when the world is ending.
Maybe, especially
when the world is ending.
That one is better.
That's the horseradish.
Mmm.
I couldn't find
any mustard, so...
I think it goes
well with it.
Yeah, it's really...
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Kind of makes up for it.
Stay calm.
It's okay.
(SIGHS)
After a while,
you just get used
to the locusts and
the blood rain, and...
Oh! And the fiery rocks
falling from the sky.
Is that Trevor Burdick?
Oh, yeah.
I think it is.
Trevor, get inside, man.
I ain't scared!
Bring it on!
Wow, he's so dumb.
An idiot.
Trevor...
Mmm.
That was horrible.
Yeah. Well...
What?
No, it was horrible.
It's terrible.
What were you
going to say?
Nothing.
What were you
going to say?
I mean, come on,
the guy is standing there
with his hands up,
yelling, "Bring it on."
He's stupid.
He's an idiot.
Am I wrong?
No. That's not funny.
That's a...
It's human life, you know.
Dumb, dumb human life.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
No, that's not funny, Ben.
That's sad.
He's a dummy.
(GIGGLES)
You want to, uh...
Yeah. Later, baby.
My parents are going
to be home any second.
Later, like...
No.
No?
(DOORKNOB CLICKS)
See. Home.
Kill me.
(MRS. LEWIS YELLING
INDISTINCTLY)
Is the therapy
helping your mom at all?
Yeah. She seems to
be crying a lot less.
She still says
"why" a lot, though.
Oh, that's good.
Rocks. Baby.
Come on.
Sounds close.
MR. LEWIS: You go up there
and he kicks you
right back down.
You might as well
have had the sugar.
(THUDDING)
Dad!
(SCREAMING)
(WAILING)
No!
Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why?
My eggs.
My eggs.
LINDSEY:  That day was
the worst day of my life.
Which is saying something
in the apocalypse.
(MRS. LEWIS WAILING)
I didn't know how to feel.
(DOOR SLAMS)
(TV PLAYING)
The apocalypse was hard
and stressful for everybody.
My brother Clark
and his idiot friend Fry
were actually into it.
But I think that's
because they were idiots
before the Rapture, so...
Where are you
going, Clark?
Oh, uh, Fry and I are
gonna kayak the blood river.
I don't think that's
a good idea, Clark.
Whatever.
Clark!
(EXHALES)
Hey, Clark.
Hey, buddy. Be careful
out on the river, okay?
Because your mom
could seriously
not handle anything bad...
Dude, suck it.
Keep any open wounds covered.
Later, asswipe.
(SOBBING) Asswipe!
(DOOR CLOSES)
Be careful of the
wraiths, Clark.
The wraiths have
been here a while now,
and they're still bad,
I guess.
Like, some of them still
work for The Beast.
But a lot of them are
basically unemployed,
and they don't really
have anything to do.
So, a lot of them
have become serious potheads.
You know,
joints or a bag.
Dude, forget it.
You still didn't
pay for the last bag.
Look, I'll pay you.
No. Forget it.
I will destroy you.
We will destroy you.
Wow, I'm so scared
right now.
Just one joint, man.
Fuck! Fine, here you go.
Thanks, man.
POTHEAD WRAITH:
Thanks, bro.
Do you ever fucking bathe?
Are you still
seeing Catherine?
Yeah, she's intense.
You shouldn't let
bitches push you around.
LINDSEY:  Everyone was
struggling to get by now,
except the people
who made a deal
with the devil.
I mean,
they were on his payroll.
And you've recently split from
your wife of eight years,
Kimberlee, why?
Well, she's kind of a stupid,
vapid whore, Liz. (CHUCKLES)
I'm just kidding.
And now she's
off in Los Angeles
trying to be an actress.
(SNIGGERS)  Good luck.
I prefer to be
right here in Seattle.
Go Mariners.
Are there any
romantic prospects
for The Beast?
The problem with
most of the women
I meet is that they
are all sluts, you know.
And I'm looking
for somebody who is, uh,
old fashioned.
The girl next door.
With a nice rack
and a nice round...
(BEEPS)
See. Right there.
BEN: I can't see you.
I'm right there
behind him.
Right there
with the mustache.
Oh, yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
Not bad, huh?
Your old man's on
global TV there,
Benjamin.
If you ask my opinion,
the guy has gotten a bad rap.
He's the Antichrist, Dad.
"He's the Antichrist.
He's the Antichrist."
I'm just saying, he has done
a couple of good things,
so sue me.
Like what?
Seriously, like what?
Okay, well,
for instance, um,
He is the most evil individual
who has ever lived, Mr. H.
"The most evil individual
who has ever lived"
is paying the bills
around here.
I'm just saying, he's not
as bad as everybody says.
That's all.
He blew up Chicago, Mr. H.
I am not saying
I support everything
he has done, Lindsey.
I was totally against that,
and I said so at the time.
There is no good reason
to blow up Chicago.
Except for the food,
the weather,
and the people.
Okay. Now, you are defending
him blowing up Chicago.
No, I'm not, Ben.
I'm just providing context.
(CHUCKLES)
You know what?
You guys should
come work with me.
Then, you would see the deal.
No, we are not going to be
Beastly Guards, Dad.
You don't have to
be a Beastly Guard.
You could work in the shop.
And you could do the kitchen
with the other gals.
Yeah,
a couple of guys just quit.
Well,
they didn't quit, per se.
They were laid off.
Let go. Killed.
Look, they were
working against him, Ben.
I mean,
what's he supposed to do?
Give them a raise?
You are so morally lost.
Hey! Kiddo, I'm just saying
that's the way
the world works,
and you are not exactly
raking in the dough
at the homeless shelter.
Somebody has to help
those people, Mr. H.
Are you trying to
be good or something
so that you get raptured?
Because,
I'm telling you, kids,
that was
a one-time dealy, okay?
(CHUCKLES) And this one
up here, forget about it.
You are not going
anywhere with all
the carrying on in your room.
You'd think masturbating
powered the lights
around here. (CHUCKLES)
Hey, I'm not going
anywhere either, Ben, okay?
Your mommy is
going to be up there
all by her lonesome.
I miss you, babe.
We are going to work
on the sandwich cart.
Uh-huh.
Hey, health insurance.
Dental.
They cover acupuncture,
Lindsey.
Thanks for the pizza.
(MOCKINGLY)
"Thanks for the pizza."
I never liked you.
Kids.
World's Most
Embarrassing Raptures.
Ha! The rapture show is on.
What the fuck?
This guy is on a toilet.
(CACKLING)
I saw it coming
and I still laughed.
LINDSEY: You know, I was
thinking, if this goes well,
and we make a little money,
I think we should
move out of our parents'
and get a place together.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Maybe get married
and start a family.
I mean, would you really
want kids?
In a world like this?
(WHOOSHING)
Things are bound to get better
at some point, right? So...
Maybe that point is right now.
Just humor me.
I'll humor you.
Come on.
Come inside.
BEN: Are you kidding me?
What the fuck?
I'm fucking done
with this shit!
No. Come on.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
I really, really loved that
food cart idea, Ben.
I did, I did. I did.
I very much wanted
to see you kids
succeed at that,
but let's not
kid ourselves here.
It is not easy to
make money these days.
Well, we're only going
to do it until we have
enough money to
rebuild the cart, Dad.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
A month, max.
SHORT WRAITH: But people
will tell you cardio
all the time. And...
There he is. Hey.
How is it going today?
Oh, let's see.
Oh, this is yours.
Yeah.
"Dickhead."
Says it right there.
No. That's not
what it says.
Who are these?
This is my son
and his girlfriend.
Just bringing
them to work today.
Your father's an asshole.
Just so you know.
(MR. HOUSE CHUCKLES)
We have fun.
No, we don't.
He's just having fun.
No, I'm not.
A real joker this one.
Not with this guy.
We've got a minivan
coming in.
It's not a minivan.
Soccer mom coming through.
Not a minivan.
(BUZZES)
Okay. Well, fuck you.
Oh, really? Fuck me?
Fuck you!
A real asshole.
MR. HOUSE: Now, The Beast
isn't here, so everything
is kind of chill.
Pretty cool of your old man
to be showing you
around on his day off, huh?
I am going to put you
kids by the pool area.
It's a very kick
back assignment.
You are going to love it.
Hey, Margie,
flowers look great.
Don't look anybody
in the eye, okay?
I'm serious.
Don't look anybody
in the eye.
This is it. This is the pool.
Gorgeous, huh?
Now, you gotta be careful,
because there are landmines
all over the place.
(GOLF CARTS APPROACHING)
Holy dick and balls.
BEN: What is it?
The Beast.
He's coming down.
What for?
I have no idea.
Okay, but listen.
Whatever he says,
you just say yes.
MORGAN: Let's go, guys.
Line it up.
So, don't say anything.
Don't even say yes.
Okay, I'll say yes.
Walt.
Hey, Morgan.
No matter what happens,
you say yes.
I know the deal.
(MOCKINGLY)
"I know the deal."
All clear here, boss!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Well, what a treat for me.
Delightful to meet you,
young man.
A real chip off the old block.
And you are handsome
and intelligent...
Little Beast has some
special requirements
for the pool area.
Uh... I'm sorry?
The pool area.
You heard me say
pool area, right?
Yes.
Where are we
standing right now?
The pool area.
Yeah.
The motherfucking pool!
Shut up!
Okay.
But I'm not...
Yeah.
Are you dumb or just stupid?
(STUTTERS) Yeah, of course.
The pool area.
What can I do you for?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Tell him what you want,
Little Beast.
The Beast.
KIMBERLEE:  Hey, Earl!
(GRUNTS)
You never call me back!
Kim. Slow down.
Tell him what you want.
I want a big slide.
Okay.
Hey, Earl...
My name is not Earl, okay.
It's Beast.
I don't give a shit
what you call yourself.
You're still an asshole.
I will fuck your shit up!
Goodbye, Kimberlee.
Don't you fucking
hang up on me! Don't you...
(EXHALES)
I hate you!
I wish you were dead.
(CHUCKLES)
Very funny.
Right back at you, kid.
We need this done by
next week. You got it?
Yes. Of course.
Go back to the cart,
Little Beast.
Next week.
Who's your assistant,
contractor?
MR. HOUSE: Huh?
Oh! Nobody.
That's my son, Ben.
No. Not Rachel Maddow.
That is his girlfriend,
Lindsey.
(WHISPERS)
I'm a pool contractor now?
Shut your mouth.
(WHISPERS) What am I
supposed to do? This is
what I deal with every day.
Welcome, Lindsey.
Uh, thank you.
Can I get you anything?
Some iced tea?
Mocha? Latte?
Hot dog?
Corn on the cob? Sausage?
Other dick-shaped food?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Yes. Yes, you are.
Mmm.
He's a children's asshole,
but he's an asshole.
(WHISPERS) You son of a bitch.
Thanks for leaving me out
to dry.
Do you want to go for a walk
around the premises?
Oh...
I just...
I'm not a man
you want to say
no to, my dear.
Oh.
Come on.
Come. Come. No pun intended.
Okay, pun very much intended.
(CHUCKLES)
I won't bite you. Come on.
Okay.
Back to work, contractor.
Yes, sir.
Back to the house,
Little Beast.
But, Dad!
Get the fuck back in
the house now! Fucker.
Fuck!
We are traveling.
We are traveling.
Fuck!
Fuck!
No, this is bullshit.
Don't.
Don't.
No, but...
Don't.
Listen,
these people will kill you
as soon as look at you.
I'm not going to
let the Antichrist
steal my girlfriend, Dad.
Oh, come on.
What are you going to do?
Challenge him to a fight?
I don't know.
But I'm going
to do something.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
Look, they're just talking.
You need to
believe in me, Dad.
Oh.
Believe in you, Ben?
Really?
Yes!
Come on!
THE BEAST: You are delicious.
You know that?
I bet your vagina tastes like
pistachio mint ice cream.
Low fat.
Tell me, Lindsey,
what's a gorgeous girl
like yourself doing
in a job like this?
Well, my boyfriend,
Ben, and I...
Ex-boyfriend. (CHUCKLES)
I'm just kidding.
Not really. Go ahead.
Yeah, we were starting
this sandwich business
and, um, our cart got crushed
by one of those falling rocks.
Ooh.
Bad luck.
Right. So, now we're just
working with his dad.
Bad luck for you,
but good luck for me. Huh?
You look like a cross between
Scarlett Johansson
and Hilary Swank.
Did anyone ever
tell you that, Lindsey?
No.
You got to be kidding me.
What did you say?
Scarlett Johansson,
Hilary Swank. Fucking, yeah...
Shut up.
Both lovely ladies
with lovely racks,
like yourself.
I have a wonderful,
spontaneous idea.
Let's have sex in
these bushes right here.
What?
Yeah. What do you think?
Don't fight
the impulse now, Lindsey.
Uh... No, I don't...
That's okay. No, thank you.
I really don't
want to do that.
What?
I don't want to do that.
Why not?
I think you do.
No, I don't.
Come on. Why not?
So many reasons. I, uh...
I just don't do that.
You don't what?
What are you, a virgin?
(CHUCKLES)
You are?
Really?
Well, yeah.
Whoa! A virgin?
Whoo! Did you hear that?
(CHUCKLES)
They are hard to find.
Winner! You a virgin?
That's great.
Honey need a little slap.
Girl's going to
give it up to you, sir.
Shut your mouth!
I'm so sorry.
Where are your sunglasses?
Mine fell in the koi pond.
It's not a big deal.
No, it is to me. Yeah.
You got to take it
to the hole, sir.
Mmm-hmm.
I probably shouldn't
have said anything.
No, I get it. You want
your first time to be
special, beautiful.
Yeah.
And so it will be.
I promise you,
your first time, no anal.
This way, my dear.
I don't care, Dad.
I'm going to punch
that guy in the face.
Ben, come on.
Be reasonable.
No, I am.
Ow!
(GASPING)
Oh, shit.
We just met though, so...
And at first,
I swear, I thought you were
just another hot piece of ass,
but a virgin! Ohhh!
That is really something.
Fuck you all.
That's rude.
You know, I'm no good
at this type of thing, but...
Fuck it. Marry me, Lindsey.
Marry me and become the mother
of my evil offspring.
What?
I know!
Call me impetuous.
Call me an incurable romantic,
but something in
my gut tells me
you're the one for me.
Okay, you already
have a son, though.
Little Beast is a dud.
I need more children,
a mini-bus full, you know?
(BEN GROANS)
You all right, Ben?
You hit me with a shovel?
Only a little bit.
You are having reservations,
aren't you, my dear?
Yes.
I can tell.
This is a horse.
It's big.
I want to show you
something, Lindsey.
Not that. Not yet.
You will see my penis later.
Oh.
I am going to get that guy.
Ben, come on!
What? Are you
going to hit me again?
Shit. Shit.
I gotta get him out of here.
I know exactly
what you are
worried about, Lindsey.
You do?
"But, Mr. Beast.
"As much as I'm
attracted to you, and I am.
"The truth is, I'm scared.
"If I marry you and
become your evil queen,
"won't people despise me?
"Won't I become a target,
just like you?
"And unlike you,
if I'm killed,
I won't return as 'Satan.'"
Why am I using air quotes?
I will be Satan.
Yeah, um, actually...
Hey, hey, hey...
You will become a target,
but there is a weapon here
that very few people
know about.
That's a...
Yes.
A real live
XGLTLGL laser beam.
Or something.
All right.
See, there's this
rumor going around,
this prediction of sorts,
that before long,
someone who shall
remain nameless,
Jesus, is going to come down
from the sky and vanquish me.
Oh.
Yeah. But I don't think so.
Oh! Oh, wow!
Do you see that crow?
Hey, fuckers. Toss my salad!
Okay.
Primer set.
(BEEPING)
Whoo!
Yeah! Bam!
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah! Toss my salad,
crow! Suck my balls!
That big motherfucker up there
has no idea who
he is dealing with.
I call it my
you-know-who buster.
Uh-huh.
Excuse me.
Oh.
So, you see, my dear,
you will be perfectly
safe here with me.
(SIGHS)
So, what do you say?
No!
Thank you.
Fine. All right.
I understand. Um...
Of course, I've got to kill
everyone you know,
starting with your boyfriend
and his father.
What?
Your choice, my dear.
No, wait! Uh...
If I could just
have a little time
to think about it.
(SIGHS)
Of course.
You have eight hours.
And in that time,
if you are not back here,
ready to marry me
and bear my evil children,
I will kill everyone you know.
Sound fair?
Okay.
Ohhh! I feel so good
about this, don't you?
Take the rest of
the day off, Lindsey.
Get ready for tonight.
Paint your toenails,
trim your bush,
bleach your asshole,
douche, whatever.
Eight hours, remember?
Ohhh.
Don't trim your
bush too much now.
Okay.
Adieu, Lindsey,  adieu.
Bye.
Toodle-oo!
Slow this bitch down!
It's fucking
with my vertigo,
motherfucker.
BEN: Jesus, Dad.
MR. HOUSE: I'm not saying
it's good or right, Benjamin.
I'm just saying
he's the Antichrist, here,
and you are you.
Thank you.
You know what I'm saying.
He's like a god.
Which is ironic,
if you think about it.
Maybe Lindsey
will like it. Huh?
Lindsey is not
going to like it.
How do you know?
Because she likes me. Right?
You don't like him.
Hey, how do we
know anything?
No! I know she likes me!
MR. HOUSE: (MOCKINGLY)
"I know she likes me."
That's what you
sound like right now.
Why would you mock me?
You are such
a terrible father.
Hey, Linds.
Um...
I just wanted to say that
you know, ever since
your father was squashed
by a big giant rock,
I feel like a father to you.
You know?
And as your father,
I feel like
I just have to say
I just think
you have to go
with The Beast here.
Thanks for the advice.
And of course,
if you don't,
and he kills Ben and I,
and not to mention your mom
and your brother,
and who knows who else,
then as long as you
are happy with that,
that is all that matters.
You know?
(CHUCKLES)
Because that means your honor
was more important
to you than we are.
She is not going to
go with The Beast, Dad.
I know, Ben.
I know.
Your mom is going
to have a meltdown.
(WAILING) We're cursed,
Lindsey! Cursed!
Why! Why, Lindsey?
Why are we so cursed?
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Maybe because you
are so annoying?
I am not annoying, Clark.
I am a woman with feelings.
(IMITATES MRS. LEWIS)
Oh, my God! I'm going to be
in-laws with the Antichrist.
Poor me.
I like to cry all the time.
I hate Clark.
Mom, just deal
with it, okay? God!
Why!
(DOOR SLAMS)
Clark, be nicer to Mom.
Okay, Linds,
what's your problem?
This is what you gotta do.
You go with this Beast guy,
you have a great night out,
and at the end,
you fucking knife
the shit out of him.
If I knife him
he comes back as Satan.
Okay, then fucking
knife Satan, too.
I don't know.
Just keep on knifing him,
don't stop.
That's not going to work.
Oh, uh, my sister's supposed
to marry The Beast.
Oh, congrats, Linds,
that's great.
No, we're going to kill him.
Yeah, I just said that.
She should fucking knife him.
Fucking knife him.
Just grab a knife and...
(GRUNTS)
Just fucking
knife him in the chest
and watch his
insides pour out.
(BOTH BABBLING)
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Vick, I told you not to
come here before 2:00.
You got a serious
problem with pot.
You know that, wraith?
What? Me? Come on, guys.
(CHUCKLES) It's me! Vick!
When was the last time
you went one day
without weed?
Um... Yesterday.
Really?
If you are going to do
this much you should
get a vaporizer.
Okay. I know.
It's a cry for help
and you know it.
(SOBBING)
Mom, are you okay?
Honey, I just...
Do it, Lindsey.
Go with The Beast.
Please. Please. Please.
Mom!
Please. Please.
I can't stand
another bad thing
happening to this family.
I can't stand it.
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!
I am not marrying
that evil idiot, okay?
He's not killing
everybody I love.
There is a plan
to deal with this
and Ben and I are
going to think of it.
Okay.
Okay. If you're
going to stand there
at least do it while you're
making us coffee, okay?
Okay.
I love you.
I'm sorry I hit you.
Bye, Ben.
I'm going to make coffee!
BEN: What about
that guy you knew?
Uh...
The mob guy,
Gina Pagano's cousin.
LINDSEY: It's a good idea.
He got raptured, though.
He did?
I'm starting to
think that maybe
we should have
just gone to church
with our moms.
Believed. You know?
Yeah, but if you don't,
you don't. You know?
What if we
really are cursed?
We're not.
But what if we are?
We're not.
We have gotten through a lot.
We are going to
get through this.
Uh-huh.
Because we just are.
kick the Antichrist's
ass myself, I will.
I know. I know.
I'll do it.
Did you find anything?
We definitely
can't kill him,
because of the whole
"possessed by Satan" thing.
Right. The only ones
who can kill-kill him
are Jesus and God, right?
Right, but it does seem
like he could be locked up.
Yeah. That is what's going
to happen, apparently.
He is going to be locked up
for a thousand years.
By God.
Yes.
Why for just
a thousand years?
Why not forever?
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.
It makes no
fucking sense at all.
You have him,
why would you let him go?
I don't know.
This shit!
It just seems so
pieced together.
Did anyone think it through?
Wait. Why couldn't
we do this?
Do what? Lock him up?
Sure.
How?
Okay, well,
do you remember how Buster
was a total escape artist,
and my dad had to build him
that completely
escape-proof kennel?
Yeah.
Wouldn't he yell?
Fuck you!
You will suffer forever!
Even if he did, you know,
nobody likes him,
he's the Antichrist.
Who would help him?
That's true. That's true.
What if he got out, though?
We'd just have to
be incredibly careful
that he didn't.
Remember to always, always
keep the Antichrist locked up.
Yeah.
Maybe over time
we could turn him good.
How?
We could get him
a little pet.
Oh.
Have you been
chewing on my books?
You adorable little scamp.
I think after 50 years,
he's not even
going to be that bad.
Chocolate chip
cookies, kids?
ALL: Thank you, Uncle Beast.
You hungry little
motherfuckers. (CHUCKLES)
Wait, Linds, no.
How are we going to do this?
What do you mean?
Think about it, I mean...
I'd have to get on to
the property, right?
Past all the wraiths.
And the Beastly Guards.
Right. And the Beastly Guards
kill everybody they see.
Everybody! We'd need someone
who couldn't be killed.
And who can't be killed?
(GRUMBLING)
Excuse me, Mr. Murphy.
Hi.
We were wondering
if we could just talk
to you for a minute?
I'm just mowing
my lawn here.
Right, and it looks great.
As always.
But, we were wondering...
Well, we actually
need your help, sir.
What?
Yeah, see,
you're really the only one
who can help us,
because you're dead.
Dead?
Who is dead?
Nobody.
He doesn't...
Aw!
I'm just mowing my lawn here.
Right,
but we were wondering...
Just mowing my lawn here!
Dude, you're dead.
You're dead.
Plus, you have no lawnmower.
You're pushing nothing.
(GRUMBLES)
Mr. Murphy?
Okay?
LINDSEY: I don't think
it's helping.
MR. MURPHY: You're dead,
if anybody's dead...
Wait. Stay here.
I have an idea.
(MUMBLING)
Hi.
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?
Can I borrow
the truck, Dad?
Yeah. What for?
To take Lindsey
to The Beast's.
Yeah. She's going with him.
(LAUGHING)
Ohhh!
Ben!
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so relieved.
I'm so relieved
she is going to fuck him.
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
Good for her.
So, uh, what's all this?
Oh.
The thing is,
he's demanding a dowry.
A dowry?
Yeah, isn't that weird?
Yeah, well,
it's old-fashioned for sure.
Uh... But nice in a way.
Exactly.
Hey, Ben?
Yeah?
So, you're going to
give him the mower?
Well...
What do you get the guy
who has everything?
Yeah.
What's really going on here?
Nothing. Like, I mean...
The dowry.
Yeah, I don't believe you.
We are going to fight him.
Oh, God! Ben!
Don't be ridiculous!
No, listen. We have a plan.
Aw...
Aw! Aw!
You have a plan!
What is it?
We are going to
lock him in a kennel.
You can do that.
You can keep him prisoner
for a thousand years.
Aw!
(CHUCKLES)
I didn't know.
I didn't know
that you could lock
the Antichrist
in a fucking kennel
for a thousand years!
You dumb, empty,
retarded, mongoloid,
idiot child!
What if it doesn't work? Huh?
Do you have a backup plan?
It won't work.
You don't have a backup plan!
I don't need one.
Stupid!
I can't let you do this, Ben.
You are going to have to.
I'm going to have to, huh?
Yeah.
Put down the shovel, Ben.
Are you going to hit me
with a rake now?
Come on. Put it down.
(IMITATES MOWER MOWING)
He got really freaked out
after you left and
just started doing that.
Mr. Murphy, sir.
No. Not talking to you.
Can I show you something?
Nope.
I think you will like it.
Nope, nope, nope.
Fuck it.
Nope, nope, nope.
He smells really bad.
Do you like it?
It's yours if you want it.
All you have to do
is keep mowing.
Oh. Nah.
(GRUNTS)
Unnecessary.
Oh, he's super gross.
He's really gross.
LINDSEY:  This was our plan.
Number one,
Clark and Fry
help Ben get past
the wraiths with their pot.
Number two,
I use The Beast's obsession
with my lady bits
to distract and drug him.
Ow!
Number three,
get our zombie neighbor
to draw away the guards.
And number four,
bring the drugged out
Beast back
and lock him up
in Buster's kennel.
(GRUNTS)
Good plan.
Almost nothing can go wrong.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Oh, my God!
You look so slutty.
Thanks.
Wow. Okay.
Um...
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Well... (SIGHS)
What else are we
going to do, Ben?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Are we sure
this is a good plan?
Yeah. It is.
And it's the only one we have,
besides me having
sex with him,
which is not
going to be the plan.
No.
You know.
So, I'm going to take care
of him and the guards.
All right.
I'll deal with the wraiths,
and, um, we will use
Mr. Murphy to deal with
the perimeter guards.
By 9:00, for sure.
Can you handle
him for that long?
Oh, yeah. Totally.
He is so dumb, Ben.
Good.
(EXHALES)
Okay. We can do this.
Right?
Yeah, we can.
Right?
I love you.
I love you.
I'll see you in
a couple of hours.
Okay.
(CAR HORN HONKING)
Awesome.
I love you, Mom.
I love you too, honey.
Have fun. (CHUCKLES)
Call or text if you're
going to be really late.
Yeah.
So when do we leave,
Benjamin Franklin?
Five minutes.
If we run into a problem,
here's what we do...
Let me guess. Knife him?
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, totally.
Stab him in
the fucking gut, right?
Or in the back
of his neck.
(BABBLING)
Can't you guys
fucking stop?
This is extremely important,
and you are acting
like morons.
Revelations tells us
what's going to happen next.
Spoiler alert.
Jesus is going to
come down on a white horse
and smite the Antichrist
before God
sets up his kingdom
here on Earth.
(CAWING)
CROW: Blow me!
Assholes! Rim job! Fucker!

I'm going deep tonight.
Oh, shit.
You want to do it?
Did that get you wet?
My pussy's so wet.
What?
I didn't say that.
I didn't say anything.
THE BEAST: Wow.
Lindsey, you look...
Look at those titties.
So lovely.
Thank you.
Did you, uh...
(IMITATES RAZOR BUZZING)
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Yup.
Trim bush!
Aw!
(IMITATES WHIRRING)
Sorry?
That was me
getting an erection.
Oh.
That's nice.
Thank you.
Service it? No!
Now is the time
for romance.
These are from him.
Carnations.
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.
You have such good taste.
I know.
Lindsey, I cannot imagine
a lovelier receptacle
for my evil seed than you.
So much seed.
(CHUCKLING)
(MORGAN BLABBERING)
Just wait here
for a second.
If you break his heart,
I'll be super pissed.
All right, let's go.
He will join you
in the parlor.

Oh! Actually, I would love
to pour this for you, sir.
Of course, my dear.
So, you like eggs?
I fucking love eggs.
They remind me of titties.
Good to know.
Chocolate eggs, Easter eggs.
Any type of eggs.
You put some eggs in that,
I am eating that shit.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I love jelly beans, too.
But I hate Peeps.
I despise them.
I'm putting those assholes
out of business. I promise.
Sure.
I fucking hate them.
Put them out of business.
Tomorrow, as a matter of fact.
Marshmallow ass chicken.
Feel the power
of the fucking Beast.
Peepco.
I kick so much ass
my feet need condoms.
So, how's the gay boyfriend
taking all of this, my dear?
You know...
Badly. Like a bitch.
"Please don't leave me."
"No. I'm with The Beast now,
tiny, little, tiny boy."
"But please, I love you."
"Get away from me with your
chicken baby penis."
"Oh! Lindsey, please."
"I want Beast cock."
"Please." "Beast cock!"
"Please." "Beast cock!"
Something like that?
It was just like that.
(CHUCKLES)
What can I say?
I'm The Beast.
I know these things.
(CLEARS THROAT)
This is for you.
Thank you much.
I...
I feel so silly,
this is so embarrassing.
What?
I was hoping that...
Yes?
Maybe we could get
all the Beastly Guards
in here.
Freaky.
Anyway, and have
them come in this room
and propose
a toast to me, please.
(SNORTS) I thought
you had a challenge.
Beastly Guards.
You will now come to me
and join me in
toasting your new queen.
This is Morgan
on the PA system.
All Beastly Guards
please report
to the dining area.
I'm not drinking
any of that shit.
SHORT WRAITH:
I tell you one thing.
Noxzema...
Well, well, well.
The prodigal asshole returns.
Uh, I'm here to make
a delivery to Walt House,
the asshole.
Yeah, well,
you are not on my list.
He promised me
that I would have
no problem getting this in.
Oh, God, that is so sad.
That's a sad story.
So, you're just going to be
impossible about this.
We are. Get your vehicle,
turn it around
and get the fuck
out of here.
All right. Fine.
Wait.
What's that smell?
What smell?
You know that smell?
(R & B SONG PLAYING)
What's happening, bros?
Do you want some?
No.
How much of this
do you have?
I got a fucking pillow.
He's got a fucking pillow.
Come with me.
Leave the car running.
Come on.
Come on.
Come, Beastly Guards.
Get your fat asses in here.
Drink the nectar of eggs.
Toast your new queen.
Make sure everybody gets some.
Go, go, go.
(SIGHS)
To you, my dear.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
God damn it!
I promised Little Beast
I would go say goodnight.
He will be crying
all night if I don't.
Don't you want
the drink, though?
It looks so good. I made it.
Don't worry.
We will fuck soon.
Duty calls.
THE BEAST: Get your fucking
ass into bed, Little Beast!
No!
Don't be a dud,
little fucker.
Kids.
Did I say anything
that deserves that?
So much.
What a dud.
That's not a nice thing
to say about your son.
Oh, my sweet,
protective, mother hen.
He's still a dud, though.
He won't be like our children.
Here's a naughty idea.
Let's have sex
on his bed right now.
Let's wait until after dinner.
Of course.
Okay.
(STOMACH GROWLING)
I gotta take a poop anyway.
(GRUNTS) Oh!
This is going
to be fantastic.
TALL WRAITH: Aw!
That's excellent weed, guys.
Fuck!
(ALL LAUGHING)
Are you sure I can't
make that delivery?
Really quick.
Hold on one second. I forgot.
What did you want to do?
You are so high.
I am.
What do you think?
Yes.
Yes?
No, I think that's a bad idea.
No, dude, don't be so
fucking paranoid, man.
Am I being paranoid?
Yeah, what if it's
a fucking great idea, man?
That's what I'm saying.
(STAMMERS)
I'm saying
it's a good idea.
Get out of here.
Yes. Do it. Just do it.
Okay.
Do it.
Do any other wraiths
want to party, man?
You should call them up.
Let's go to highville.
(ALL LAUGH)
Do you want to
blow up something?
Let's blow up Helsinki.
Um.
Buenos Aires?
Listen, I want to blow up
the whole world tonight.
How do you
feel about that?
What?
Kind of.
Ooh. That is sexy.
It is sexy.
You're not the girl
I thought you were.
No.
You little vixen.
You gonna blow up
the world with me?
Yeah, I'm going
to do that tonight.
(CHUCKLES)
We are going to
the bust the world up.
Hell, yeah.
I'm going to bust
all over your face.
Uh-oh.
Was that too much?
(GRUNTS)
Are you ready to
cut some grass,
Mr. Murphy?
Yup.
Now remember,
there is a lot
that needs to be cut.
So don't stop until
you get all of it.
No.
And don't let
anybody stop you.
No.
You do know how to drive
one of these things, right?
No.
(ALARM BLARING)
THE BEASTLY GUARD:
Hey, you!
Shit!
Shit.
All right, just mow.

Go check him.

What was that?
Did you guys hear that?
Dude,
I don't hear anything, man.
Yeah, dude,
you are being paranoid.
Am I being paranoid?
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Dude, turn the fucking
music up.
(VOLUME INCREASES)
(SINGING)
Damn, this is good. Shit!
Nothing like a shrimp
and mushroom omelet,
am I right?
Um...
Where was I, my dear?
Your ex-wife.
God, I can't even
believe I did that.
I was young and stupid
and seduced by
a natural blonde.
Do you know what I mean?
I think I do, yeah.
Her pubes were blonde.
My pubes are black.
As you will find out.
You know
the secret to shrimp is
to take out
the dark line
in the back.
That's their poo.
Three to four times a day.
That's why I'm so healthy.
Good. That's impressive.
I'm glad you told me.
Thank you.
Uh...
Do they have any more
of that eggnog left?
I'm so thirsty.
So, where do you want to go
for our honeymoon?
Um...
Not that it matters,
because you'll be
getting face fucked
the whole time,
am I right?
Hey.
Let's stay here
and just have intercourse.
And watch movies.
I love intercourse.
I love movies.
Are you a Vin Diesel fan?
I love Vin Diesel.
Fucking
The Chronicles of Riddick,
are you kidding me?
It's the best.
It's so underrated.
See. You see?
I do.
We are connected.
Right here with you.
Let's go make
the beast with two backs.
(CHUCKLES)
Get it?
The beast with two backs,
because I'm The Beast
and I got a back
and you got a...
It's not that funny.
Come on, let's go.
Um, yeah, we could...
We should...
We should go to the Jacuzzi.
Jacuzzi?
Sounds sexy.
It's going to be.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
What the shit?
Dude, what the fuck
are they doing?
I think I saw them
take some 'shrooms, bro.
(GUN COCKS)
What is going on
with your hands?
(CHUCKLING)
We should
fucking knife them.
Fucking knife them?
Yeah.
Fucking knife
the shit out of them.
(MR. MURPHY YELLING)

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
MORGAN: Stop your vehicle!
Oh, shit!
THE BEAST: Ah!
If I was a dinosaur,
guess what kind
of dinosaur I'd be.
What?
A Lickalottapuss.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Do you get it?
That's so funny.
I do get it.
Because I would be
licking your
vagina all the time.
Ohhh.
What are you
looking for, baby?
I'm right here.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Um...
Ben?
Are you calling
your boyfriend?
Come on, Ben.
Baby!
I thought we had something.
This hurts.
I thought we had a moment.
Ben!
That's cool.
I didn't really
like you that much.
(CHUCKLES) Whatever.
Okay, Ben, seriously!
Ben!
Let her go, Antichrist!
This is who you
are screaming for?
This Frodo-looking
motherfucker?
He even walks gay!
I'm The Beast, baby!
Beastly Guards.
Most of them are
chasing a dead guy
on a lawnmower.
Okay, what does that mean?
Wraiths, come to me.
(FAINT R & B MUSIC PLAYING)
(DISTANT LAUGHTER)
Fucking useless potheads.
Just let her go, man.
Or what?
Or I will kick your evil ass.
Baby.
(CHUCKLES) That's...
That's a good one.
Hey, I got a good one, too.
How about you do like this
(SPUTTERS) to my booty-hole.
I'm warning you, Earl.
My name is Beast.
What are you going
to do to me, anyway, huh?
What, you going to kill me?
I'm going to lock
you in a dog kennel.
I don't even know
how to respond to that.
But you know what?
Seeing as how I have
better things to do,
like make it
with your lady,
how about I shoot you?
No!
God damn it.
Back off.
Give me that.
(YELLS)
Fuck!
I killed Jimmy Neutron.
Baby.
Back up.
What?
What are you
going to do, huh?
You don't want to shoot me.
Unless you want me
to come back as Satan.
Don't push me. Okay, Earl?
I'm really sick of this crap.
And honestly,
you in particular.
You are so lame.
I'm lame?
You're dating Peter Brady.
I've been letting you say
this gross shit
to me all night.
The fact that
anybody is afraid of you
is incredible.
If they knew what a child...
It doesn't matter,
I will shoot you.
I will totally shoot you.
Whatever.
(GUNSHOT)
(GROANS)
That's for being an asshole.
Let's party, baby.
(GASPS)
(GUNSHOTS)
Fuck!
(GROANS)
See you later, baby.
Oh, shit.
Oh! Baby.
Baby, wake up.
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
Why do I keep
getting hit in the head?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, baby.
I shot him.
Hmm?
Baby, I killed him.
Where?
I'm serious. Right here.
(THE BEAST GROANING)
(GASPS)
Fuck. I am unstoppable!
Ow!
Now what do we do?
Just keep killing him.
Until what?
Maybe it will
take at some point.
Baby, I'm going to
need more guns.
Okay, I'm on it.
That really hurts...
Damn!
(GUNSHOTS)
Ben?
Yeah.
Will you stop shooting...
(GUNSHOTS)
Fuck you!
This can't be legal.
Ben?
Yeah.
I know what you're thinking.
(GUNSHOTS)
Ow! Bitch!
Quick question.
(GUNSHOTS)
I'm getting pretty
good at this, baby.
I'm coming!
Motherfucker!
(LAUGHING EVILLY)
What are you
going to do now, fool?
What time is it?
You don't seem like the type.
No.
No, that won't work either.
Go to bed, Little Beast.
Little fucker.
But I have an idea.
How does this go down?
I need a screwdriver
or something.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
What is that?
BEN: It's coming right at us!
Ben, wait!
Ben, wait!
(YELLING)
(HORSE WHINNYING)
(THUDS)
BEN: Oh, no!
Oh, no.
This is so bad, baby.
I didn't know, Linds.
I thought it was a rock. Fuck.
This is incredibly bad, Ben!
Okay, okay.
Can we do CPR? Maybe?
You laser-beamed him, baby!
I don't think CPR
is going to work.
I can't believe
I did this.
Aw!
How could I have been
so fucking stupid?
I feel really sick, Ben.
My dad's right!
I'm a fucking idiot!
(LIGHTNING CRACKLING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Is that...
What?
Is that him?
Idiots!
What have you done?
(STUTTERS)
Um...
Okay.
Well.
Yeah.
Answer me!
We sort of killed
the Antichrist at first.
We did.
It was not nearly as
hard as you might think.
Right. Yeah. We just shot him
with a regular gun,
and then Ben was
hitting him with a shovel.
Just bonked him.
That was it.
You barbecued my son.
I...
I saw this thing
coming from the sky,
I had no idea what it was.
It could have been bad.
He didn't know.
It could have been bad.
I panicked...
And I...
Yeah. I laser-beamed him.
I beamed Jesus.
I'm so sorry.
It was a total accident,
though.
Yeah, total.
Do you two have any idea
what you have done here?
Um...
Well...
No.
There was a plan.
A rather detailed
and specific plan
involving the final chapter
of all human existence!
Do you understand
that that plan
is completely ruined?
We didn't mean to.
We are so just
incredibly sorry, sir.
It was a gaffe.
Ugh!
It was a mistake.
(IMITATES BELL RINGING)
It's all I needed to hear.
You're sorry.
I forgive you.
It's kind of what I do.
(CHUCKLES)
It's all good.
We will just start over.
It's no big deal.
It's not like I spent
a lot of time on this.
Only 4,000 fucking years!
You proud of yourselves?
You pathetic little shits.
Fuck you, dude!
Don't, no.
You don't have to be so mean.
I'm sorry,
but you don't
have to be so mean.
What did you say, whore?
You heard me, man.
I said, "Fuck you."
You are being a dick.
(SOFTLY) Not to God.
You're a dick!
You're like a bug to me!
You made her.
Yeah. Good call, baby.
(MOCKINGLY)
"You made her, so..."
He doesn't talk like that.
I'm not Southern.
You talk exactly
like that, Ben!
That is how I made you!
He doesn't have
a pinched nose.
What is that?
You sound exactly
like that.
No, I don't.
Give me that sweater.
Don't do it.
Just give me
the fucking sweater!
Because I'm fucking God.
Give it to me.
Don't do it, baby.
Do it!
Don't, he has a jacket.
Don't.
I want a sweater!
God, wait.
Look behind you.
You actually expect me
to fall for that trick?
(CHUCKLES)
No, no, it's not a trick.
"It's not a trick."
You're so stupid.
Argh!
Oh! Earl!
What the fuck, man!
That's right, big boy!
This isn't about you, Earl.
Okay?
Oh, it's all about me.
And my official name
is Satan.
So, none of this
"Earl" bullshit.
Okay, let me smite
these fuckers down
and then we can talk.
All right?
Do you think I want to talk?
No, no, no.
All I want to do is
kick your candy ass.
What the fuck
did you say?
You want to go,
Fat Prince?
Let's do it.
Thou shalt whoop your ass!
It's on.
(GRUNTING)
Ow!
Come on, bitch.
That's all you got?
You want some? Happy Meal?
Happy Meal...
You like that?
Whoo-hoo!
Bitch.
Time-out?
No, you're fresh out
of time-outs, bitch.
Who are we rooting for?
They both want to kill us.
Right.
Revelations, bitch!
It is a pretty unusual
thing to be watching,
when you think about it.
Yeah!
You win.
Ow!
THE BEAST: Get the fuck
off me, Tattoo!
Who the fuck do you think
you're fucking with? Abraham?
I am the Lord!
(CRUNCHING)
Ow!
Suffer!
Not me, you little fucker!
I'm gonna fuck your shit up!
Come on, Confucius.
I'm gonna bottle you,
motherfucker.
I'm gonna fuck you up.
Argh!
(YELLING)
Fuck you, Earl!
Almighty, my ass!
You are a terrible father!
You are one to talk.
Touche!
Earl...
My name is Satan!
I had enough of this shit!
(CRACKLING)
Shit!
(EXHALES)
BEN: Wow.
(SIGHS)
I definitely didn't think
that was possible. Right?
You would have
thought that God
would have seen that coming.
Yeah. Maybe he did?
His plan was to get
electrocuted in a Jacuzzi?
Most of it didn't make
a lot of sense to me,
so it's possible.
(MR. MURPHY GRUMBLING)
(PANTS)
They shot at me!
You fucking idiots!
I should spank you both!
Wow! You did it!
You killed him.
I knew you could do it.
No, you didn't.
You just had to
apply yourself, Benjamin.
That's all.
You're not a loser anymore!
Good for you.
And who's that right there?
Is that...
Yeah.
He's tiny, huh?
So...
Wow.
I mean, huh, right?
A lot of questions.
MORGAN: There he is!
Dead zombie motherfucker.
Stop that fucking
lawnmower!
Stop it!
What the fuck?
You killed him?
Oh, thank God.
It's over.
Right.
We did it! We killed him!
(SIGHS)
No more beatings.
No more rapings.
(SIGHS)
I guess that means
I'm in charge.
I wouldn't take that leap.
That's a big leap.
I'm the leader of the world.
Bow down before me!
No.
MR. HOUSE: What? No.
How come all of a sudden
you're in charge?
There's as much
reason for me to be
in charge as for you.
You? Fuck, no!
He thought you
were the pool guy.
He used to rape you.
You have a massive head wound.
That is a brain injury.
So what?
You look like a jerk.
You guys. Um...
(CLEARS THROAT)
Look at your mustache.
Most world rulers
look like jerks.
Who cares? What?
You guys, um...
Um, I just feel like,
probably, nobody is in charge.
Or, well...
Everybody's in charge.
Everybody's in charge.
So, it's a good thing.
Uh...
We're all in charge.
We can be grown-ups.
Everybody okay
with that?
Yeah.
You are definitely
not in charge, though.
So what do we do now?
Just live.
That's what we're gonna do.
Right?
That's deep, baby.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Yeah.
Just live.
Let's go make out.
All right.
You kids be safe.
We're gonna live.
Yeah. I might, uh...
I might go back to school.
MR. HOUSE: Yeah!
Yeah.
I never went to college.
(CHUCKLES)
I know. I know.
It's over.
(CHUCKLING) Okay!
It's so nice to be held.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, you're so strong.
Okay.
I like those big arms.
Don't make this into
something it's not. Okay?
Huh?
Don't make this into
something it's not.
You didn't feel
anything there?
No. Let's just live.
Live our lives.
Right.
All right.
Okay.
I thought with the mustache
and everything, you...
No.
No.
You're sending
a real message there.
No.
"Put a dick in here."
Ohhh.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Hmm.
Life goes on, man.
Ohhh!
Life goes on.
LINDSEY:  After that night,
things went back to normal.
Good Sandwiches went
from a smashed lunch cart
to a popular
lunch destination.
Overall, I'd have to say
the future looks really,
really bright.
Okay, that sounded
really corny, but...
Whatever. I killed God
and the Antichrist, man.
I'll do whatever I want.
The rocks stopped
falling out of the sky.
The wraiths were still around,
but Mom made some new friends
and calmed down a little bit.
If you guys are hungry later,
I made an amazing pot
of beans last night.
It's, um... They've been
hanging out in a Crock-Pot
for almost 12
hours at a low setting,
and I'll tell you what,
I soaked those
guys overnight, and, uh...
It's better than
the quick soak.
Some things didn't
go back like before.
Like Mr. Murphy.
Still dead... Undead.
But Ben and I stole
his lawnmower back for him.
He loves it.
Doesn't seem to notice
we broke the motor, either.
This used to be
the Devil's mansion!
It's ours now!
(LAUGHS)
Ben's dad now lives
at The Beast's mansion.
I'm not sure that he should,
but who's gonna kick him out?
(GUNSHOT)
(ALL GASP)
I put PCP in the salsa!
(CHUCKLES)
This is gonna
get fucking crazy!
Fucking crazy!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
Let's go to Mexico!
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)
