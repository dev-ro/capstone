Aman, my brother
Aman, so simple, so loving
He always had a smile on his face
Aman was a very hardworking
He would go on and on,
till he was satisfied...
sketching, bringing out the lines
He was a bit naughty too
He would make ugly faces
to make me laugh
We were so happy, really
Aman, Ammi and l...
we were so happy
Your Abba, Allah rest his soul,
used to say that...
daughters are born into homes
that are blessed by Allah
Meaning that sons are born into homes
that aren't blessed by Allah?
Mad girl! Daughters serve.
That's why he used to say it
As of now, you're serving the daughter.
- Why are you jealous?
Let me pick that nonsense
out of your brains
What do you mean nonsense? Ammi, you
better tell Apa. Else, l'll get angry
Angry!
- Don't you rile my baby
Let him watch the picture
l've seen this picture ten times over.
l'm waiting for the news
D'you know what's happening in town?
- What's there in the news?
They start fights for
out-of-work hooligans
Those leaders instigate simple men
to commit murder. Damn them
Here they might get away with
whatever they feel like doing
But in kingdom come, just you see
how they will be punished
Look! l didn't even realize
it's so late in the night
Go on, you two. Go to bed.
- Ammi...
See the news tomorrow.
- Ammi! One minute!
TY shut
What's this Ammi?
- It's very late
What's this ''good-night''?
Can't you say ''Shabba Khair''?
Shabba Khair, Ammi
Come on, go to sleep
Don't tire your eyes.
Go to sleep
May Allah keep my family
from harm's way
That dog is crying again
Yery bad sign
Mercy, Allah
What's up, Firoz?
- Aman, they are killing our people
Even burnt down Uncle Sadiq's shop.
- What can we do?
Let's go and take a look.
- No. We'll get caught in the riots
We won't. Come on
Stop thinking. Come on!
- Come
They've gone mad! They're going to
kill each other
Lord curse the makers of
guns and bullets
Get away from the window!
Go to Aman!
Ammi! Aman isn't there!
- Where's Aman?
Run Aman! Run!
Salaam, Mrs. Bhige.
Everything all right
Yes, Nishat Bi. Sit
Your son hurt his hand. How is he?
- Kids. No matter what, do they care?
Pain, one feels with age. One blow,
and the pain stays till the very end
Will you drink tea?
Don't you drink tea either.
Here, gram pudding
Cooked with pure milk fat.
l wouldn't know, though
He sold it to me saying it's pure.
- You look happy. What's up?
Fiza has passed!
- B.A. pass? (Graduation)
Good! What does she want to do next?
- l don't know. Says she'll do a job
Poor girl, what else can she do?
She has to run the household
Her Abba's pension isn't
bountiful enough...
to provide for a comfortable living
in these times
The same old rented house.
The same old way of living
Allah is my Master. The One
who helped us all along...
will surely help us live the rest
with dignity
Now Nishat Bi, let's talk of what
you've been coming here for...
once every week, these six years
No news of your son. So many times
on TY he has been announced ''Missing''
So much questioning. Result, zero.
l don't think there will be any news
There's no news of 1 60 people.
Hindus, also Mussalmans
You aren't the only one.
There are so many who are crying
Why should l cry? Let my enemies cry.
l'm sure he's alive. And he'll be back
Someday, he will surely come.
Salaam aleikum
lt's so hot today
Who is it?
- No one
Who was it?
- l told you. No one
Why were you so tense in the car?
lt's nothing at all.
- That someone on the way
You saw. And you reacted
lt was Ammi.
- You should've stopped the car
She wouldn't have liked it
The place she was coming back from
... she goes there on the sly
On the sly? Where?
l understand
Someday, everything will be all right.
Who knows when that day will come?
Come on, hurry
l still don't believe l passed!
l only read your notes
But with you, they were unjust.
You should've scored at least 7O_
659b is more than enough.
l couldn't really study hard
Can't study at home. Had to make do
with what l could at the library
You could hardly study in the library.
There he was sitting right across
Anirudh.
- Gitanjali, l don't fancy idle talk
lf you keep raving like this,
some day, l'm going to strangle you
Go on, strangle me.
But my dying words will be...
Anirudh Roy and Fiza Ikramullah
''The Lord grants the believers''
''Here we will be given''
''Seek here with your heart''
''Seek from Haji Ali''
''The Believer''

Shehnaz!
Aunt, you?
You've become as rare as
the Moon on Idd! Forgotten us?
Not at all
So much work at home...
l'll come. Surely
''Bestow upon us the benediction
of Mohammad''
''Bestow upon us the benediction
of Mohammad''

empty-handed from here''

''my life will be a misery''
''Whoever has submitted to you
The Lord will care for''
Where have you been for so long?
Go in and have the Fatiya recited
And give the cookies to the kids
What are you doing, Ammi?
Charity
Stop it now, Ammi
Now l haven't said a word, have l?
Why did you have to splurge money
like a queen?
You were handing out tens
as if you've won a lottery
So that's why you're grumpy.
Darling, if l had my way...
l would've palmed out in hundreds.
Your Abba, Allah rest his soul...
l don't want to hear what Abba said.
He died, and he left us here to die!
Sacrilege Fiza! Must you speak ill
of the dead?
Why shouldn't l? In this house,
who's alive? You? l...?
The only question is about...
- Enough!
You start running your tongue
like scissors!
Get a hold on yourself!
Someday, you'll go to another house
This attitude won't do.
- First, you get a hold on yourself
lt's been six years. You've turned
this house into a waiting room
Eyes, staring out of windows;
ears, glued to the door...
one knock, and you jump.
Day and night, twenty four hours
lt's just the same thing. Do you
know how much you've changed?
You even turn away from me
to hide your red eyes
Why did you fall silent?
Take it out
l won't say a thing. Because
l'm your mother. l bore you
l don't understand!
How long will this go on?
How long are we to live like this?
- Not me. Ask that of your fate
Fate, fate, fate! Nice word.
But hollow. What will you eat?
Shall l cook turnips?
- Yes! He used to love it!
He used to hog it by the potfuls!
One man sent these flowers
Who was it?
- Didn't tell me his name
Came in a big car.
- Big car?
Yes, he called me and told me
to give it to you
All right, go
Who's this Romeo sending flowers
to my daughter on the sly?
But he's a miser.
- Orchids. Yery expensive
Why throw it away? You should keep
flowers in their vases
The flowers will bless you
Flowers! Your Abba used to bring
baskets full of jasmine!
And l'd distribute them
to all the neighbors
And now...?
There's no one left to lay
a few flowers on his grave
Flower girl! You look great!
How about some flowers this way?
Raspberry!
- Let me have the flowers
Come down!
She ran!
One more!
Where are you rushing off with
the flowers, like an express train?
Don't call me. It's ominous.
l have something important to do
No harm done. A mother's curses
turn into blessings
How about a quick bite?
- No time!
One minute.
- l know your one-minutes too well
Anyway, get back early.
Before sundown
l keep worrying.
- Your curfew is my command
Any more commands?
lt's just to ward off the evil eye
For God's sake, don't talk English
Go with a smile.
Come back with a smile
By Allah! What a beauty!
Fiza has become so pretty!
The bounty of youth is spilling over!
Shut your mouth, you fool! Must you
say whatever comes to your mind...
you mad girl?
- Mad? l...?
The whole world was mad about
my voice, my style!
All a matter of time, Nishat Bi.
Gone are the connoisseurs...
gone are the times. l'm still
the beauty l was...
my voice is still as wonderful!
- And still as mad!
Stop keeping up all night
for that girl
Else, you'll keep losing like this.
- How about another game?
Shoot it!
You come all the way here,
to see me!
What's that file about?
- l'm going for an interview
lnterview? For some small-time job?
Come over to Dad's office tomorrow.
l'll fix a job for you
l don't want a job
on recommendations
Such vanity?
Listen...
First try at a job?
- How did you know?
Job-hunters don't look at watches.
l'm an old-timer in this jungle
Relax. Your number won't come up
before four or five hours
But in the papers, it was an
On the spot interview
On-the-spot means they won't spend
two Rupees per postcard to call us
lt's just a drama
Don't get nervous.
You'll get used to it
You'll stop marking time. You'll even
forget asking for months and dates
Want a drink of water?
Bisleri. Municipality water.
Boiled it at home
Drink it up
What did l tell you?
Listen, isn't there any other way
out of here?
Lots. But l can't leave my auto
and walk. Mumbai traffic
Relax. Listen to a song
Hey girl! Can't see? Gone mad?
Go somewhere else if you want to die!
Go on. That's all for today
Why are you so late? l'm afraid...
if you too leave me...
l'm not going anywhere.
Where can l go? Have l any way out?
Why are you getting worked up?
l didn't tell you anything
l thought l saw him in an auto.
l ran, but there was so much traffic...
l couldn't do anything! Come on Ammi,
give me my jewelry
Why?
- l want to pawn it
What for? Thanks be to Allah,
we're eating well enough
l need the money. l want to put an end
to the suspense
lt doesn't let us die.
It won't let us live
l want to look for Aman.
For that, l need money
How much will a pair of anklets
and earrings fetch?
l'm not selling. l want to pawn it
l won't give!
Because you don't have the guts
to find out the truth?
You don't even want to know what
happened that night...
what happened to your son!
- Yes! l don't want to know!
Old as l am, l have no hopes left,
but for one full-blooded son!
l don't have the son.
But the hope, l still have
You want to take it away from me?
l have nothing else!
Hiding the ailment won't heal
the wound. It festers
l have decided. We aren't going
to live in agony
l'm not going to let the wait
kill you, kill me
Trust me, Ammi
l'm saying the right thing
l need 25,OOO. Please let me have it.
Don't you trust me?
We had it made from your shop.
- What a thing to say, sister
lf l didn't trust you, wouldn't
l have deducted interest in advance?
Say, do you agree to 1$,OOO?
All right. Let me have it.
May l make a call?
- Why not. 3 Rupees for a local call
Here you are. 1 $,OOO
The entire amount?
- Yes. All of 4,OOO
Why are you staring like that?
Were l not on duty, l would've
downed seven, eight glasses
You were supposed to tell me
what happened that night
This is the copy of my deposition
in the court
Everything that happened, all l saw
is written in there
l have heard your deposition.
l was in the court on that day
Then, what more do you want to hear?
- That which isn't in that affidavit
The truth.
- No melodramas
Did l tell lies in the court?
- If you cannot tell me...
give me back my 4,OOO
What you want to hear,
l can tell you
But you're from a decent family.
So let me tell you something
Forget whatever happened
Listen...
peel off the scab that covers
the wound, and it hurts more
There are so many people in trouble.
They killed old Sawant's son
Sawant is begging. Forget all that.
Eat popcorn
Tell me what happened that night
He was running
Sahib! Help me sahib!
They are after me!
They're going to kill me!
They killed my friend!
We haven't done anything!
- You want to live?
Run! Run away to Pakistan!
Burnt my husband alive with
a tire around his neck!
Do something! For Allah's sake!
Do something!
What are you staring at?
Get lost. Move it
Go away
What can we do?
Back out
We're ruined!
You left a half-dead boy
Iying on the streets?
lt wasn't time for sentiments.
Had l tried to save that one...
l would've had four more corpses
on my hand
Any idea where my brother
could've gone?
What can l say?
Even if anyone saw him,
who remembers?
You remember nothing at all...?
Maybe... somewhere... something?
lt's so old a matter
... what can l say?
Among them... among the corpses...?
Was my brother there?
Might be
Might not be...?
Might not be
Do you sleep peacefully at nights?
- What did you say?
l don't know whom to curse
What... what did you say?
Curse...?
Take that. For your beer
Burnt
ls this what l've lived to hear?
Possibly he wasn't in that
pile of corpses...?
Even after hearing everything,
l still don't believe it
lf l knew it in my heart, maybe
my eyes wouldn't be dry. He can't die
Tell me what you're going to do.
- l don't know what l'll do
l just have a hazy idea in my mind
Don't get into anything dangerous.
Promise me
Don't make me promise anything, Ammi.
Trust me
Have anything? Give me
May you be happy
Your name is Sawant, isn't it?
Who are you?
Fiza Ikramullah
l don't want your money!
Take it away! l don't want it!
lnspector Prakash Ingle told me about
you. Your story is the same as mine
My story? What did he say my story is?
What story did that bastard tell you?
Your son...
- Yes. Killed my son!
Killed my son! And the bastards
want evidence!
Said, get the evidence that
your son is dead!
This government wants evidence!
Mussalman, aren't you?
Your people kill my son?
Why did your people kill my Chandu?
What had he done to harm you?
This isn't a matter of yours and mine.
For all of us, it's the same story
A Hindu father has lost his son.
A Mussalman sister lost her brother
But the ones responsible for this
is neither Hindu nor Mussalman
What their religion is,
no one knows
Still, why did they kill my Chandu?
He was a laborer
He was to have come home after work
... from the factory
Must've taken him... in the trucks
l don't even know if he got his
Iast rites. Who lit his pyre?
Might've put him on a pyre
for the unidentifieds
They want the evidence because
they'll give compensation. 200,OOO
Price of a live young man. 200,OOO!
My son's price! Chandu's price!
200,OOO pieces of paper!
l don't want their money!
What will l do with the money?
If l beg, everyone will give me
When l'm dead, the municipality will
cremate me for free. Unidentified!
The way they cremated my Chandu!
l don't want it!
Can l do anything for you?
Yes! Can you get me proof
of my Chandu's death?
No one wants to hear Sawant
lt's as if humane feelings
have gone missing
Like Aman
Not even typed out
Have you ever been published before?
- We generally don't accept...
stories from freelancers.
- l'm not a freelancer
Nor do l fancy becoming a journalist.
l have come to you because...
you have closed this issue.
- What's new in this report?
A six-year old dead story.
- Dead, yes. Yery much dead
Because it contains no spice?
Give me my papers
But tell me one thing, Mr. Menon.
What would you do if...
a member of your family was missing?
Wouldn't you write anything about him?
Would or would you not use
the standing of your newspaper?
lf it was your sister who came to you,
would you throw her out this way?
And it being said of the pen being
mightier than the sword...
is this the way...?
l got carried away. But the deeper
the pain, the louder the scream
Give me the report.
Let me see what l can do?
Have you seen this news?
- Moron! l've seen it and read it
Find out who penned this angst. Tell
her Y.K. Singh wants to see her. Now
Read this and mourn. This is how
our community has been persecuted
This is no time to sit passively.
We must take notice
Call her, what's her name? Fiza.
Tell her Sheikh sahib has called her
l shall give her justice. l shall
Yes, l'm ready
Don't be nervous, Ammi
l looked for him everywhere.
But out there, it's pitch dark
lt seems as if Aman lost his way
in the darkness
My intention isn't only to find out
what my brother had been through
l also want to find out
why it had to happen
And who gained what?
Fiza Ikramullah is raising questions
for her country to answer
For how long will this go on
in the name of religion?
Who is to answer Fiza Ikramullah's
questions?
Do you have his photograph?
- Yes
Handsome boy
What was he doing? Studying?
Books weren't for him.
He never liked studying
But he was very good at
drawing, painting... handicrafts
Though he was uneducated, he would've
been successful in his life
You mean to say that?
- Yes, that is what l mean
How is your family making a living?
- Ammi teaches Urdu. And there's...
Abba's pension. The bank deposits
he left for us paid for my graduation
So you're looking for your brother
so that he comes back...
and starts earning, to take care
of the household expenses
l do not mean that at all
Now you're getting angry.
l asked because l wanted to know
May we talk business?
- Why not?
You're a well known figure now.
Were you to tell the people...
that we aren't against any religion
or any sect, people would listen
You see, the Mughals invaded us,
they dominated us. We forgave them
You people went away and made
another country for yourselves
Not that we mind it.
- Don't say ''you people''
Those who created Pakistan have gone
away. And most of those who didn't...
are dead. None of those who created
Pakistan are here any longer
We are as much Hindustani
as you are
You're getting angry again, Ms Fiza.
Look, what l meant to say is...
for someone as educated and
open-minded as you are...
it's a must to know more about our
party. Whenever you have the time...
get in touch with our Youth Wing.
- You want me to become a member?
That'd be nice! You help us, we help
you... takes two hands for clapping
So you can put me on a flag and wave
me at the world? For Muslim votes?
l thought you're a liberal.
- You need say no more
Do something, if you can do it
Listen. . .
- Do remember what your Gita teaches
To perform your duty,
without any expectations
Bloody mosquitoes
Thank you
Hail India
Help! Somebody help me!
What's up? why are you screaming?
- Kill that!
Kill it!
- Scared of a rat?
Yes! Kill it! It's going to chew
Ulfat Jaan to bits!
Fool, if it even licks you...
it's going to die of poisoning!
Won't come back, will it?
- If you sing out of tune, it will
You say l sing out of tune? You're
out of tune! And your mother!
And your grandmother! All you did
was to scare a rat away!
What d'you think you killed?
1 OO tigers? Get out of my house!
You're such an ingrate, Ulfat! You
curse someone who does you a favor?
Curse...? What half-caste is cursing?
It's just my style of talking
lf you want to show-off your style,
go to a brothel
This is a respectable neighborhood.
- Have your say! Were my fan here...
he'd clam you shut!
- Let's hear who that ''fan' is
Aman, my love! l was his soul-mate,
his confidante, his trustee
We had such fun! Like children
But l always kept an eye on him.
To ward off the evil eye
Caught you! Now pay my ransom
Aman no! For God's sake!
Not that. Anything else
No way. Only that
The old men are watching
Aman you're so nice, aren't you?
- Not at all. l'm evil!
l'm going to cry.
- Why not? Do it fast!
And as soon as you shut your eyes...
- Shameless!
Call me names later.
First, my ransom
No!
All right, if not that...
a hundred sit-ups,
and you catch your ears. Start.
All right
One...
Two...
All right, shut your eyes.
- That's more like it
On my lips.
- Cheek
All right. On the cheek.
- Shut your eyes!
Shehnaz, dear!
Aman
What were you doing?
- Nothing!
Nothing?
Bye.
- Bye!
What's going on?
- Oh that...
we were playing hide-n-seek.
- l can see
Romantic hide-n-seek!
- No Ulfat Jaan! Nothing like that.
ln my days, l played lots
of hide-n-seek
But time you know, put a blindfold
on my eyes, and forgot all about me
l've been waiting to get caught!
- You won't tell Ammi, will you?
Why?
- Because l'm the last of your fans!
Prove it
Had l not spurned my fans, l would've
had a full-blooded son like you
Get going. Shehnaz ran away. Go after
her. Call her back. Go on, give chase!
Tomorrow is going to be another day.
Don't miss out today!

Shehnaz is getting married
the day after tomorrow. Do you know?
Why don't you go and tell her to wait
for Aman? He'll come back. He will
There are no secrets a mother doesn't
know. That's what l wanted too
He'd marry Shehnaz, have babies.
Our family would go on
lf l had my way, l would've stopped
Shehnaz's wedding
But how do l tell Shehnaz
to wait any longer?
What a beautiful match!
The band is out of tune!
What a bore!
lt's the age of senseless tunes
People with a sense of music
are sitting quietly
Welcome sahib! We've been
waiting for you
Please be seated
Sahib, something chilled you?
Here in a minute!
Who's that?
- Ulfat Bi! Hush!
He's Syed sahib. Yery big leader
My best wishes.
- Thank you, Apa
lt's all by dint of your good wishes
Forgive me, Apa. l couldn't
wait any longer
Why apologize to me?
If you can...
forgive that ill-fated fellow.
He has wronged you
Fiza my child...
- Yes?
Syed sahib wants to meet you.
- All right
Relax, my child
Your late father came to me often.
You were very young...
when he died. Heart attack, wasn't it?
- Yes
Have an ice cream, my child.
- No thanks
l ordered it for you.
- No thanks
What are you doing these days?
- Trying to find a job
No big deal. l run a small school.
You can start tomorrow if you wish
Hazrat Allah Bahari put it aptly.
''Mothers, sisters, daughters...''
''the world derives dignity from you.''
- Thank you. But l won't be able...
to start from tomorrow.
- Any particular reason?
l'm busy with something important
Some people think otherwise
of your efforts
They say that you're trying to revisit
the apocalypse of 1 992-93
lt could well turn out to be
a horrific illusion
You might stand to gain from
the quest for your brother
But for the community, it might
turn out to be a grave loss
Will you consider that?
- You too should consider
Has or hasn't a sister the right
to look for her brother?
Does or does not a mother
have the right to hope for son?
lf misconceptions are worrying you,
you should clear their doubts
Disown me
Get a hold on your emotions, my child.
Who says, l'm not on your side?
Hear me out. The wounds have healed.
Dig up the wound, and blood will flow
Syed sahib, l don't know
how l'm supposed to react!
Why are you people afraid of the truth
... you, the inspector, the editor...
Y.K. Singh... everyone is telling me
to shut up! But why?
And even if l were to shut up,
what'd come out of it?
Even Justice Harikrishna's report has
been made public. But what use was it?
We want to make peace!
You want to start a fight?
Peace will be Syed sahib, when
every one stays within limits
The truth is that the colors
green and the saffron...
are but parts of Hindustan's flag.
And parts are what they ought to be
None of them must try to color
the entire flag. Do you get it?
Salaam
See who's coming. Firecracker!
- Hi sparkler!
You've become a TY star? Big TY star?
How about doing MTY Grind with us?
Hey, she's showing eyes!
- Whom are you giving that stare?
l'll fix you proper!
No, don't!
- Leave me!
What are you going to do?
Are we scared of you?
Hey, she's getting Technicolor's!
Raspberry, what's happening to you?
Hold your tongue! Else...
- Else, what will you do?
Help! Abdul! Riyaz! Sooraj!
Any of you here?
Anyone here? Come on, out!
Go on, get lost
Move back!
Let's get lost
Why are you fellows running now?
Weren't you trying to scare women?
lf you're men enough,
come on, face us!
That was just the trailer.
- Wait for the rest of the movie
Rascals! They torment the helpless.
- Don't ever say that Ammi
We aren't helpless
Flowers!
He gave flowers
l think l like your flower-boy
Most importantly, there's an honesty
and a sympathy in his eyes
Nowadays, he isn't even miserly
about flowers
What is it Ammi? You aren't thinking
about marrying me off to him, are you?
What use is thinking? But l'm not
prejudiced about creed and caste
One must be clean at heart
Why can't the Hindu bosom
have a Mussalman heart?
And why not the Mussalman
with a Hindu heart?
Your Abba, Allah rest his soul,
used to say...
love is the true religion.
Come on. Now...
- Read the rest of the book tomorrow?
As you wish!
Any news of Aman?
No.
- After the newspaper report...
the media and politicians apart,
has no one contacted you?
Who knows? Maybe no one else
actually read the report
Nowadays, people only read headlines.
- Assuming he's alive...
He is alive. My eyes can't be fooled.
l know it at heart
Then, where is he? Why is he hiding?
Why doesn't he come back?
Could he have joined some group?
What group?
- Don't take this otherwise
l mean, some terrorist group,
some extremists. . .
Show me Aman's photo
What are you doing?
Look at this. l downloaded this
from the internet
Compare the eyes
This terrorist was spotted
somewhere in the border area
Border area?
- l'm coming with you, Fiza
Girls mustn't travel alone.
- It isn't about who's boy, who's girl
l have to do this myself.
- Can l do nothing for you, Fiza?
Take care of Ammi
Sister...
Want to take my photo?
You must've seen all of the desert
Thar is the backyard of my house
There isn't a roof over it.
But the backyard is vast
You look like a city girl.
what are you doing here alone?
l'm looking for someone.
- In this sea of sand and dust?
Looking for someone? Tough to find.
- Have you seen him somewhere?
l haven't!
Take a look, please.
- Don't you get too smart, girl!
l'll carve you!
Sister, please see!
- l haven't seen it!
See it properly. For once!
- l told you!
What's happening, Bhairav?
- Just another day
You weren't up to something
yesterday night, were you?
Listen to that! Nowadays,
it's an honest living
What would you like?
Bread, and rice wine?
Shut up! You know what l'm asking.
Where is he?
Reshma is inside. Getting dressed.
We're celebrating today

what will happen tomorrow?''
''My love''
''Let me drink from your eyes''
''Something aches inside my heart''
''Let me live the ecstasy''
''The ecstasy''
''Ami, l have searched for Aman a lot''
''But l see him only in my dreams''
''l've had enough of this search''
Listen...
Aman, where have you been?
Why did you leave us?
Have we wronged you?
Whatever we've been through
is now in the past!
But what have you done to yourself?
And in the company of people like...
They aren't that like that
Then what are they like?
Tell me
Why don't you say it? Say it!
Look at me in the eye, and say it!
What haven't l done to find you!
And this is how l find you!
This? My brother...?!
l wanted to be happy to see you alive!
This is the happiness you give me?
You want to know?
Want to know?
Then come with me
Jehad
What l'm doing is Jehad
Against whom?
- Repression, injustice, apartheid
You fight for spoils
and you call it Jehad?
What kind of Jehad involves robbery?
- We took only what we had a right to
What about the rights of
your mother, your sister?
Have you come to argue with me?
- No
But l'm still going to ask you
why you did what you did
Water... water
