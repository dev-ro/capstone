It's the big house on the left.
"Casa de Porter"!
Hello?
See ya, Porter!
Just the one.
It's not five o'clock yet.
I beg your pardon, little pig.
What d'ya say?
Sandy? - Yep.
- Thought you were comin' Thursday.
It is Thursday.
- Looks like I missed your boat.
Don't worry, buddy,
Uncle Paul will make it up to you.
What is this place anyway?
- It was an abandoned fishing camp.
It was a real dump when I got here.
Come aboard, I'll show you around.
Hey! Heel!
Here, boy.
We're in the poo, mate.
You like spaghetti this much?
- I'm quite a bargain hunter.
When the cruise ships are in the area,
you can do some terrific deals.
Any passengers that want Spaghetti-os
are out of luck.
I'm sure.
They're not exactly Dmaha steaks,
but you won't go hungry.
There's gotta be some mistake.
You cannot be my uncle.
You know they say: You can choose
your friends, but not your relatives.
Why don't you unpack?
I'll rustle us up some grub.
How much did she pay you
to take me off her hands?
I resent that. When your mother
called, I didn't hesitate.
If anyone
knows about divorce, it's me.
I mean, family's very important.
You guys are all I've got.
How much?
A hundred dollars a week.
Just for the summer.
Dh boy, she really low-balled ya.
Story of my life, kid.
This concert's history.
All aboard!
Come on, sailor! Shake a leg!
You don't get up, you don't eat.
Time to rock and roll!
Spaghetti-os with or without?
- Without what? - Pee-wee franks.
Suit yourself.
But out on the ocean,
you can't order a pizza.
You ever been fishing?
What d'ya catch? - A whale.
But I threw it back.
Most people think fishing's
a bamboo pole and a 6-pack of suds.
But it's tougher than that.
- Dh really.
What about seasickness?
Look, I can handle it.
Sure ya can.
Where's the bait, sailor?
Bait my butt!
You okay?
At least it floats!
Funny. Buck-faced wombat!
Just keep your eyes on the horizon.
- For how long?
As long as it takes to keep it down.
Damn dolphins stealing all the bait.
- They're scaring the fish away.
That's not fishing, kid.
That's murder.
It's pathetic.
Hey, kid!
You see where that dolphin went?
Yeah.
That way.
You sure?
Alright, Dirk!
Come on!
Go on, get outta here!
Go on. Go!
Go!
You gonna be at this concert?
- The Chili Peppers are mine!
You're splitting?
- Am I splitting!
Hey, Tommy.
You returning to the mainland?
I can't make it with no fish.
Fish are gone, I'm gone.
What, you givin' up the good life?
Good life's ancient history. I can't
feed a cat with what I catch.
Don't worry.
I'm on the 5 A.M. Ferry.
Pick me up, we'll be at the concert.
Gotta go, it's the hippy!
Thought you might
like a change. - Why?
I dunno.
Yo, Marvin!
Aren't you a bit warm?
What's with him?
- Marvin's a little shy.
Give him a spring and a wire,
he'll make an outboard motor.
I don't want to hurt him.
- But sweetheart...
Dkay, we'll put him back
in with his friends,
and we'll use this guy.
He won't mind at all.
Have fun fishing!
- Dkay.
Become a marine biologist
and you can bait hooks too...
In Boston you wouldn't get to see me.
Just my luck.
This must be Sandy.
Hi, I'm Cathy.
He probably told you about me.
No.
Can you get my stuff?
So, how's he doing?
- Like a pizza, but upside down.
I'll straighten him out.
You cooking dinner tonight?
Why? You tired of Spaghetti-o's?
You heard Tommy's leaving the island.
We haven't had a decent catch
since spring. - I know why.
The fish are loaded with dioxin.
What's dioxin?
- It's a by-product of herbicide.
How's that getting in our water?
Careful!
Will he ever take off that raincoat?
Maybe we could get it cleaned
with him still inside.
You never take me seriously!
That's not fair!
Hit me with your best shot.
When are we getting married?
Gotta go fix the net.
- Porter Ricks!
Think he'll ever grow up?
What are you doing?
Hey, Sandy. Do I look cool or what?
Dr what.
It's the shirt. It was given to me
by Brian Wilson. - Who?
Brian Wilson. Beach Boys.
What are they teaching you kids?
I'm tired. Gonna hit the hay early.
Good. Cathy's number's on the wall.
There's spaghetti if you're hungry...
- Yeah.
I'm late. See ya in the A.M., kid.
See ya in the A. M... not!
FERRY DEPARTURES
Hello?
Is that you?
Come on!
Cool!
Sorry. Gotta jet. See ya!
Shake a leg, sailor!
You don't get up, you don't eat.
Sandy?
Earthquake!
Jeez!
Storm's comin'. Board up the windows.
I can't, Russ.
Looking for a runaway nephew.
Call off the search.
He took the first ferry out.
By the way, I'll need $22.50.
He put it on your tab.
He's so cute!
Sandy?
I am by nature a gentle soul.
However, I can crush a coconut...
with my bare hands.
Hold that thought
as we make our exit...
with dignity.
Get that rope!
Sandy! Get the line!
Damn! Nice going, kid!
- You know what you just did?
I probably saved your life.
- You made me blow Chili Peppers.
Next concert's in Drlando.
I don't have tickets. - I don't give...
Great! Bloody great.
"Yeah, I'd love to see Sandy.
Send him down. It'll be great."
It'll cost me
my house and my boat, but...
I should give up
and join Tommy on the mainland.
Why didn't you just let me go?
- I'm not finished with you yet.
Don't talk like my father.
I'm not looking for another father.
Good.
Make's us even.
'Cause I'm not looking for a son.
Especially
a screw-up teenager like you.
You don't know me.
You know nothing about me.
Tell you what I do know, kid.
This here is the earth.
This is the great big ocean.
Here's our tiny island. Your mum
is way over there.
No matter how you scream,
she can't hear ya.
You got no friends, no money,
no malls to hang around. You're stuck.
All you have is me.
So get used to it.
And relax. Got a long, ugly
day ahead of us... and night.
Gonna use that pillow?
Thanks.
He snored all bloody night!
Dh man!
Is nothing sacred?
Jeez!
Get off there!
Look...
Since I know you love being here,
I'll make a deal.
You work for me,
help clean this mess up,
and I'll get you
to that concert in Drlando.
How?
I don't even have tickets.
Kid, this is Porter Ricks.
If it exists, I can get it.
We'll make that show.
We?
- Think I'd let you go alone?
Besides, I can dig the Chili Peppers.
Not the Beach Boys, but who is?
Is it a deal?
Haul her in!
Start with the fish pan netting. Mast
and stuff's in the shed or in town.
I'm gonna have to stay
with the boat on the mainland.
You gonna be alright?
- I'll be fine.
Cathy will drop in on you.
You can reach me through
the coastguard station.
But nothing's gonna happen, right?
- Right.
Right.
You...
Like my dolphin?
- Your dolphin?
That's right. I found him.
What's his name?
His name's Flipper.
Never seen one alone like this.
Alone he'd be no match for Scar.
- Who's Scar?
The hammerhead that stalks
these waters. Big and ugly.
They say he took out a tourist boat.
He likes those out-of-towners.
That jerk tried to kill Flipper.
He was shooting at him.
That's Dirk Moran, a bottom-feeder.
What are you doing?
- I'm hypnotizing him.
It's not working.
You make him do something.
Dkay. Sure.
Alright.
Alright, Flipper...
What do you wanna do today?
Jump!
Awesome!
You know...
- Where did he go?
I'm Kim.
- Sandy.
He's hungry.
- Really?
Where d'you get fish to feed him?
- Feed him?
He's your dolphin.
- Well, yeah...
Come on, I got an idea.
Lookin' good, Porter.
- Thanks.
Did most of it myself.
Most of it.
Now I just have to pay for it.
Take a lesson from your nephew.
He's becoming quite a businessman.
What's he been up to?
- You'll see!
Fish go in the bucket. Dne dollar
to see Flipper, the Wonder Dolphin.
FLIPPER THE WDNDER DDLPHIN
Dne dollar. Did you put your fish in?
Dne dollar. In there. Wow!
TDSS A QUARTER. FLIPPER RETURNS.
DRDP 25 CENTS HERE
PENNIES
Don't ask me,
I can't explain how he does it.
What's this, a penny?
It's a Lincoln penny!
Vintage, man! Enjoy!
Marvin! Come on in. No charge!
1 dollar, thanks. Fish in the bucket.
1 dollar, thanks.
Fish go in the bucket. Excuse me!
You need a fish to get in.
I don't have to pay, Kim.
I own this circus.
What's going on here?
- Dh, hi!
My best havanas! - It's the
Flipper Show! - Who's Flipper?
Alright, the Flipper Show is over.
All you kids go home, now!
Come on.
- Sorry.
You can have your fish back.
Give me my fish!
- Now!
See ya, Sandy.
Go easy on him, Mr. Ricks.
You were gonna fix the house!
- I did it so Flipper could eat.
Who do you think you're dealing with?
You did it to turn some coin.
I didn't do too bad
for myself either. Hey!
Half cut!
As for you, you oversized guppy...
I'll have to bring out the heavy guns.
We're gonna try a new approach.
It's called "Dealing with your crap."
This is how it works. Number 1:
You're gonna take responsibility for
your actions and the consequences.
Number 2: You're
gonna start getting up on time.
And at work,
you're gonna hump, not gripe.
You'll have to use your brain,
the weakest muscle in your body.
And as fo the dolphin:
If the damn thing won't go away,
you'll feed it. In your own time.
And stand up straight!
Dh, and you wanna be
a big man with a cigar, right?
Fire up that puppy!
Keep it stoked! From now on,
when I smoke, you smoke.
Washed your hands? Sit down.
Stogies down.
Let's eat.
Mom, when are you picking me up?
- In 2 weeks. What's in your mouth?
Cigar.
- A what?
I've been smokin' up a storm.
Uncle Porter lets me drink beer.
He also knows a lot of
loose women. - Put your uncle on!
Yeah, Porter.
- He can't smoke. He's just a kid!
Hang on a sec, love...
It's DK,
he' s about to kick the habit.
Ready for another?
Dh, please,
I'll never smoke again!
Good. Now go and
take care of that poor little fish.
Good boy. Thanks.
Bring it to Sandy. Go on!
Porter!
I can't find Marvin anywhere.
I'm really worried. - Jump in.
1 minute 20.
Hey, Sandy!
Marvin, what's up?
Cool, huh?
Come on down.
Careful on the dock, Marv.
It's kinda slippery!
Alright, Marv. Meet Flipper!
Marvin!
- Flipper!
Way to go, Marv!
Are you guys telling secrets?
We were wondering what the deal
is with you two? - What d'ya mean?
You in for the long haul,
or is it just a fling?
Sorry, is that the wrong question?
Not at all, Sandy.
I'd be interested in the answer.
Eat up, it's getting cold.
Well, the gang's all here.
Word has it you have a pet dolphin.
I wouldn't call it a pet, Dirk.
No? The way fishing's been,
we don't need a dolphin...
to tear holes in nets and steal bait.
But you know that, don't you?
We're talking about one dolphin.
- You stay out of this.
Dne dolphin is one too many.
Bad smell around here.
What's his problem? - He resents
anything smarter than he is.
That includes about everything,
even these clams.
Get him!
- Dut of the way!
What are you doing?
You're hurting him!
That's enough!
You've had your fun. Let him go.
- It's the Greenpeace Warrior!
The animal means something
to the kid. - It does?
Well, isn't that sweet?
Isn't that sweet, boys?
The kid and the fish are pals.
I'd watch how I make friends.
- Enough!
