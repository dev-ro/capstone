My legs, my poor legs! Why
are they striking?
- Because you don't have a social
conscience. - And you? - I do.
- Don't your legs hurt ?
- Sure they do!
- Good evening. The elevator
is broken. - It's hardly a surprise!
(DOORBELL)
(THE DOOR SHUTS)
Damn ! It's really late !
- How are you, Michel ?
Is he in ? - Yes, Mrs.
- Is everything all right ? - I believe so.
- I'll have a look at the dinner table.
Yes, very well.
Take this, please.
(IRENE SIGHS)
- Did you do your homeworks ?
- Yes.
What's going on ? Come here !
(IRENE WHISTLES)
- Listen, I need to talk to you.
- Yes, Michel.
- Hello, George ! - (George) What
happened to you? It's so late !
Oh, yes, I know ! Blame the strike !
There was a big mess in Largo Argentina* !
* (large square in the center or Rome)
They rerouted me through
an endless series of alleys !
I wanted to tell you that I had
to invite aunt Margareth and her son.
- Tonight ? - She called me
once you went out.
(Irene) She'll be in Rome just for
three days, I didn't know what to tell her.
There won't have been
another occasion.
(George) You're really sympathetic
towards Andrea and his ideas.
Maybe in front of his mother
he'll avoid to raise the crowd.
At least you, try to be fast,
I need to change my dress!
- Tell me: what did you do
all day long - Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing ?
It's ringing, call Cesira.
- Can you listen to me, now ?
- Sure, but be fast.
(KNOCKS ON THE DOOR)
Come in!
(Irene) Cesira, I don't know if
I already told you, in the kitchen...
..to cook something light
for Mrs. Casati.
Mafalda boiled some of the fish
she bought for the child.
Fine. Thanks. You may go, Cesira.
Mom, can you listen to me ?
Go ahead. But turn around,
I need to undress.
- So, what did you want to say ?
- I'm not gonna say anything anymore.
You really want to make me
mad. Come on, what's up ?
I've been alone all day
in this house.
- (Irene) Didn't your support teacher
come ? - No, not even today.
(Irene) Probably because of the strike...
There was no public transportation.
Even last week he missed
two days in a row.
You knew he wasn't feeling fine.
I'll call him tomorrow and
we'll send a car for him. Happy ?
- No.
- So, what is it that you want ?
I don't like my support teacher,
he talks a lot and he's always too close.
He sweats, he laughs... I don't like him.
You wish you could be with
your nanny again, don't you?
But you are a man now,
you need a man like you.
Oh, God, that Cesira !
Cesira, get my white dress and
my shoes ready ! Quick !
- I'm sorry, with all this confusion...
- Good evening. - Good evening, Mrs.
- Is the champagne cooling in the fridge?
- Yes, yes.
(Doorbell)
- Go get it. - Sure.
George, go ahead in the meanwhile.
I'll be ready soon.
- Good night, Michel.
- Bye.
- (Irene) Where were we ?
- Where have you been today ?
(Irene) I've been... What do you mean,
''Where have you been today'' ?
(Irene) Should you ask such questions
to your mother ?
(Irene) We really need
to talk:...
..It's completely unproper for a guy
like you, who owns everything...
..to be always nervous and unhappy,
like a crybaby.
- (Irene) We'll talk about it later.
- Where's mom ? - (Irene) Here.
- Hello. Quick, the Orange are
already here. - (Irene) I'm coming.
(Luciana) I have to tell you what
happened at the Antonelli's place !
(Luciana) You look so good !
(JAZZ MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER)
(Irene) Good evening ! How are you ?
- Dear ! - Hello !
- Good evening ! - Good evening !
Look what Richard brought
for Michel !
Thanks ! He'll be very happy !
So kind of you, Richard.
- Here's aunt Margareth.
- Aunt Margareth ! How are you?
- Good evening, Irene.
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- She's better, don't you think ?
- Yes. She lost a little weight, maybe.
- Let me introduce you to Mrs. Orange.
- How do you do.
- Mister Chandler.
- How do you do.
Mister Orange.
Do you remember Luciana ?
Mrs. Casati
and her son Andrea.
Come sit down, aunt Margareth.
- Let's show Michel his toy.
Call him, he has yet to make it to bed. - Yes.
- What do we want to drink?
You already have something. - Yes, thanks.
Aunt Margareth, care for a drink ?
No, thanks.
Or maybe a vermouth, a little bit.
- A vermouth. Andrea ?
- (Andrea) Nothing, thanks. - Nothing ?
- Here. And me ? Luciana, what do you want?
- (Luciana) A dry Martini.
Good idea, I'll go along with it !
Ah, Michel !
Look what Mister Orange brought
you ! Say hello to aunt Margareth.
You grow up so fast !
Last year you were like this !
But you're a bit pale, my dear.
Maybe too much study, eh ?
- Yes, it's true. He looks tired.
- (George) Michel ?
- Did you say hello to Mrs. Orange ?
- Hello, dear. - Good evening.
- Do you remember your cousin Andrea ?
- How are you, Michel ? - Fine.
Say thanks to Mr.Orange.
Thanks.
Ins't it wonderful ?
Are you happy ?
Say goodbye to everybody, now.
Go and be nice, ok ?
- (Irene) Did you all get served ?
- (Luciana) yes, thanks.
(Irene) How long are you staying,
Aunt Margareth ?
(Margareth) Up until my husband will
be done with his businesses.
- Do we want to try the train ?
- Why not ? - Let's go.
What are you doing, there ?
Do you want to have fun all on your own ?
Do we want to go and see ?
- Let's stop it.
- Your glass.
- Thanks. Now, rear motion !
- It's really funny ! It seems true !
- Mrs., the meal is served.
- Lunch is ready !
Do we want to go ?
- It's funny even for adults.
- Do you want to sit down ?
Aunt Margareth, Richard:
are you hungry ?
You're here, Richard here,...
..Andrea to my left,
then George...
No, I'm wrong,
aunt Margareth will sit right there.
Richard to her right
and George there. Let's sit down.
Sorry, I'm always wrong.
(LAUGHTERS)
Aunt Margareth.
(Irene) These things make me confused,
I always make a mess.
(LAUGHTERS)
- How long have you been in Italy?
- Many years.
I studied in Florence
with my sister, George's mother.
Then I married an italian,
Vladimiro Casati.
- Does your son work in Italy ?
- Yes, here in Rome.
- What does he do ?
- He's a journalist.
A journalist ? Then he might be able to
tell us if there will be peace or war.
I'd say peace.
You're very optimistic, bless you.
I'll believe there will be war.
- I hope for peace.
- I can't see how. Am I wrong ?
I have some particular ideas
in this regard.
You're so keen on politics !
I don't get any of it !
- Have you been to that horse contest ?
- Excuse me a sec.
I would like you to tell me
why you are so optimistic.
Because there's so many of us, in the world,
wishing for peace, my lady.
Yvonne dear, maybe it's
better to change topic.
Andrea is a leftie.
- (Yvonne) A socialist ?
- Worst than that, I'm afraid.
Mrs., Michel told me to
call you. You'd better go.
Excuse me, I'm going to
check on my son.
To peace ! Cin cin !
I solved many problems,
but this boy is an enigma.
- What's up ? - I feel sick.
- Your stomach ? - yes, it hurts.
- Where does it hurt ? - All over.
- Here ? - Ouch ! - Here ? - Oh...
You're fine. Stay put, do not put
on the same show.
- You're not a child anymore!
- I can't sleep. Stay with me for a while.
I can't, we have guests.
Don't be silly, sleep now.
- Go away, I dont want to see you !
- Be nice !
Aren't you ashamed ? You're naked !
(MICHEL CRIES)
(DOORBELL)
It's Michel again.
(DOORBELL)
Go to see if you can calm him.
(DOORBELL)
Cesira, tell him I said to be
nice and sleep.
He's so nervous since a while...
He had a nanny since he was born,
up until six months ago,...
..then George decided to send her away:
maybe that's why he's so nervous.
Boys that age would better
stay in a college.
Michel is not like the other
boys, he's very sensible.
Even for me it's difficult to
understand him. And I'm his mother.
Just imagine how little
would others understand.
Nowadays educational systems
are very, very forward.
It's true. Our Switzerland
colleges are wonderful.
I think it's isolation that
makes children perky.
That's my thought, too.
Look at Chandler's son: he's in
a college and perfectly ok.
Really.
(George) He's just one year
older than Michel and a while ago...
..he flew in from Boston all on his own
and he left to go back nice and smooth.
Over the Atlantic on a plane ?
Weren't you scared to send him ?
Not really !
He had a lot of fun.
I understand.
Keep in mind that while George was
fighting at the front, during the war...
..Michel and I stayed in England
during the bombings.
Lady, the child hurt himself !
- Where ?
- (Cesira) Down the stairs !
- (Irene) Michel !
- Don't worry, it's nothing serious !
- Michel ! But...
- Easy, lady.
Cesira, give me the car keys !
The keys are in the fur coat
pockets !
(George) Ahead ! Keep going ahead !
Santo Spirito Hospital,
towards Castel Sant'Angelo !
Nothing serious:
his femur is lightly fractured.
He threw up, but I guess we
can exclude cerebral commotion.
He's now in the operating room.
He's sedated. They're almost done.
I would like Alessandrini to visit him.
I'll try calling him again.
He would like to make a phone call.
Can you escort him ?
Poor Irene !
Michel !
- Doctor...
- Everything is fine, Mrs.
(IRENE CRIES)
Don't cry, everything will be fine.
(IRENE CRIES)
I'm sorry.
These things happen to childrens.
- Call the doctor on duty.
- His femur is fractured.
Recovery will be long,
but you shouldn't worry.
- Cassiani.
- Nice to meet you. No complications?
- Just a light shock state - Ah...
- Can't we bring him home ?
Not yet,
he's still sedated.
Can't we at least find a
room to rent ?
It's impossible for tonight,
maybe tomorrow.
But tomorrow
you might bring him home.
(Irene) When did they inject him ?
(Nurse) I've just put him in bed.
Can you see how calm he is ?
- Morphine to so young a child...
Isn't it dangerous ? - No.
And it's not morphine, it's Pantopon,
a weaker sedative.
- Wouldn't it hurt him ?
- No. Don't worry.
Fractures like that are very painful
during the first days.
Yes, I understand.
(whispering) Lady...
Mr. Casati is here.
(whispering) Let him through.
I'm outside.
- Please, sit down.
- Good morning, Andrea.
- How are you ?
- Not that fine.
- It might have gone worst.
- I'm very confused.
Try not to think about it.
- I just came to say goodbye. I'm going
away for a few days - Yes ?
- Is there something I might
do for you? - No, thanks.
I don't know if it's a good idea,
to be telling you this.
The hospital doctor, which is a
friend of mine, told me that...
..he had the impression that
the fall was voluntary.
- What do you mean with "voluntary" ?
- Nothing. Stay calm, Irene.
Apparently Michel said some
things while still sedated...
..and so my friend thought he
needed to let you know.
He told me so that I could find
the most proper way to...
(IRENE CRIES)
It's absurd !
Maybe, but my friend said
that sensible children...
..are capable of everything,
even of such extreme gestures.
- It's impossible ! Andrea !
- Stay calm, at times children are...
(Michel) Mom ? Mom?
I'm coming. Excuse me a sec.
- So basically he attempted
suicide ? - Not exactly.
Maybe he just wanted to hurt himself
to attract some attention.
But go now, don't make him
wait, stay close to him.
We'll talk when I'll be back.
Don't think about it. All my best.
You've been very dear. Goodbye.
Mom ?
Here I am. Excuse me, my dear.
- How do you feel ?
- Hm...
Don't move.
Please, stay still.
Do you want me to stay here, like this ?
Go in the other room,
I'll stay with the child.
Sit wherever you want.
Happy now ?
Here... Let's stay close
like when you were wee.
Do you remember, during the war
when you came to sleep with me...
..with your frozen feet ?
It felt nice, crouched
under the covers !
Do you remember hearing the sirens ?
You said: ''Bombs'',
and then you fell asleep.
You didn't even realize when we
descended in the basement.
I carried you
all wrapped up in covers !
Do you remember that wonderful sunny
day, in the contryside...
..when that soldier was rude to me,
for no reason at all.
- What did you tell him ?
- I don't remember. What did I tell him ?
You stood up like a grown man
and told him:...
...''Do you want me to punch
you on your nose?''.
My man !
And do you remember when daddy came
back from war ?
Then you weren't with me anymore.
(IRENE CRIES)
(crying) I'll be with you again !
I'm here with you !
- Like when I had my appendix done ?
- Yes !
(crying) Yes, like that time,
just like that time !
I'll be forever with you !
Forever and ever and ever !
(A DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- Michel did not have an accident.
- What ? What are you saying ?
Michel, I'm saying...
It was no accident. He tried
to kill himself.
Come on dear, stop your imagination.
No, it's true, he tried to kill himself.
It's impossible !
It's absurd, there are no reasons.
- Who said that ?
- The hospital doctor told Andrea.
He's crazy! They're both crazy!
No... no, dear, it's true.
I understood it by myself.
And he told me.
In his way, but he told me.
Oh, George, we should change everything
in our life !
We must !
We can't continue like this !
George ? George !
- What happened ?
- No !
- Let me in ! What happened ?
- You can't get in, it's too late !
- Let me in !
- He's dead !
- He's dead ! He's dead !
- Michel ! Michel !
Quick, Lady's mother want to see what
we have prepared.
Put it here.
I can't take it anymore !
Three sleepless night in a row.
Is it ok, Mrs. ?
It's fine, Cesira.
Bring it in.
One cannot survive on
orange juice alone !
I'll go to see her.
- Good evening, dear. How do you feel ?
- (Irene) Fine enough.
Why didn't you eat anything ?
I didn't feel like. I'll eat later.
(George) You can't go on like this...
..ten days without moving
or even eating !
You need to shake yourself off.
(Irene) Please, I'm fine.
I'll get better.
Don't want to bore you, but i need to
insist, for your own good.
- Oh, George...
- Please, let me finish.
Even against our will,
we must go on with life.
Life goes on and...
we have to follow it.
Think about your mother.
At her age, she flew in from
America just to see you !
And in three days
you almost didn't speak to her.
If you don't want to think about
yourself, think about her, at least.
(crying) No, George, I can't.
Try to explain it to her.
I need to stay alone.
I need a lot of rest.
(KNOCKS ON THE DOOR)
Come in.
It's from London.
Hello ? Hello !
Can you speak louder?
I can't hear.
Ah, yes... Thanks.
(George) Good.
I'll send you a cablegram.
(George) No, call me at the office
tomorrow morning.
(George) Thanks. Goodbye.
Don't worry for me, George,
it will pass, but I need time.
- Why don't you take one of these
sleeping pills ? They might help. - Yes.
- You'd sleep. You need rest
more than anything else - Yes.
Sleep would do more
than any cure.
Yes, yes dear, don't worry,
don't worry, but...
Please, don't leave mom alone.
Go to her, then come back to me
after you've had lunch.
- Should I turn off the lights ?
- (Irene) Yes, please.
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
Hello, who is it ?
Oh, Andrea, it's her!
Yes, I called her many times,
I wanted to talk.
Yes... It's urgent.
Won't tonight be fine ?
Ah, excuse me, but it's so
important for me !
No, no, I'm coming to you.
Yes, right now. Where's the newspaper office?
Sure, right now. I'll be there
in a while. Yes.
- Irene dear...
- Did you know ?
- So sudden...
-It was an embolism.
Tell me:
what can I do for you ?
Nothing, I'm afraid. Nothing.
- Where are we going ?
- Wherever you want. I don't care.
I don't know. A quiet place,
where we could talk.
Oh, I was anxiously waiting
for your return !
Had I known all the details
beforehand...
- I called the newspaper so many
times ! - They told me.
And now that I can ask you
all the questions,...
..I feel that it's useless.
Irene, don't be like this.
Try to be strong, please.
- At times I don't know what I'm doing.
- I understand you, dear.
- Where are you going now ? Back to the newspaper ?
- No, not yet.
I might stay a bit more with you,
if you wish. Turn left.
I'm not very entertaining.
Why don't we step outside ?
Let's breathe some air
and talk a bit.
- This square is impressing, isn't it ?
- Yes...
Michel must have said rather painful
things, during the anesthesia,...
..to make so that the doctor could
understand it was a voluntary gesture.
Listen to me, Irene,
don't torment yourself.
Ah, Andrea, what a fatality !
If things had gone otherwise !
Had I said a word, made a gesture
rather than another...
Do you understand how atrocious it is
that a word one can't delete...
..resulted in Michel's death ?
(crying) I can't take it anymore,
I can't live, I can't !
Irene, torment is useless.
Useless to repeat: ''Had I said...
Had I done...'' ?
Things are what they are.
It was destiny, then.
Why such a destiny ?
(Andrea) I never mentioned
destiny. What destiny ?
Then, if it isn't destiny,
I'm the one to blame.
No, Irene, it's not your fault.
Blame society, as it allows
such horrors to happen.
What's society role in this ?
A children whose first impressions
of the world around him...
..were fear, bombings, war...
Who's to blame ?
Why should children be the ones who pay ?
It isn't right.
Then, God isn't right.
Think about this:
maybe a children must die...
..because parents can't afford
the needed medicine.
(Andrea) It happened today,
at the newspaper:...
..a mother came to beg us to do
something to help her.
She has four childs, her husband
is a miser and cleans the streets,...
..he earns just about enough
to buy food.
The medicine costs so much, it's
a new product, made in America.
Is it possible for the child's life
to be bound...
..to the money quantity needed
to buy the medicine ?
Why didn't you tell me earlier ?
I can provide the needed amount.
How could we do it ?
We can go there right now.
- No, tomorrow will be ok.
- Yes...
- We'll go there together, eh ?
- Sure.
- Oh, George...
- Where the hell have you been ?
Sorry, but I had to go out.
Didn't the doorman tell you ?
Yes, he told me, but you didn't
have to go out like this.
I've spent the last hours walking from the
door to the window like a wolf in a cage.
Why didn't you tell me you were going out ?
I was afraid horrible things
happened to you.
- Do you understand that my nervous
condition... - You're right, I'm sorry.
You must be patient with me.
At times... I think I'm going crazy.
- Can you at least tell me where you've been ?
- I've been with Andrea.
- Andrea ? What did you wanted from him ?
- I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm unable to explain it, even
to myself.
Irene, you must find the strength...
to keep on living.
We are despaired,
let's try to help each other.
It will pass, don't worry.
We'll find a way out.
We'll find a way out...
together.
Nobody could help you,
not even Andrea.
You need me
exactly as I need you.
Yes, George, everything will be fine.
(Indistinct buzzing)
- Excuse me, Where's the third lot ?
- Over there. Come, I'll escort you.
- There it is.
- Thank you.
Here we are.
- (Andrea) Does Galli family live here?
- (Man) Please, get in.
I escorted them here.
- Please.
- Galli, there's someone for you.
- May I ?
- Is it you, Sir ? Good morning !
- I brought that stuff.
- Oh, Jesus, thank you ! - Here.
This will be enough for both medicines
and hospital expenses.
If you'll need something else in the future,
we'll try to help.
(Galli) Thanks.
Do you see the state we live in ?
(Galli) We are sub-renting
this room. We are six.
Without Bruno, the house feels empty.
- Well, goodbye. Best wishes.
- (Wife) Goodbye. Thank you.
- (Galli) Thanks so much.
- Youre' welcome. Have a nice day. - You too.
- Is there anyhting for me ? - Yes, doctor,
there's a letter for you. - Thanks.
Ah, I was looking for you.
- Mister Pisani,
Mrs. Gerard. - How do you do.
- How should I write it?
- I'll think about it. Wait.
Please.
Sit down, Irene.
So... This must go.
This one, even.
Write : ''The state department
initiative...''
''..must be put in relation...''
''..with the clear attempt
of american financiary entities...''
''..to surpass England
and appropriate Persian oils.''
''The english government follows
the U.S. Initiative...''
''..with extreme diffidence.''
And how should I title it?
Write: ''Panic among London finances...''
''..for the new U.S. Persian manoeuvre.''
- Over two columns ? - No, over three,
in the first page.
- Well. Good morning, lady.
- Good morning.
- Can you wait a bit ?
- It's better for me to go, I'm tired.
- I'm sorry that you have to go on your own.
- Don't worry.
Irene, listen to me: don't close yourself
shut in your own pain.
Yes.
I was thinking: it's strange how
that people seems resigned.
It is our duty to wake them up,
shake them up, give them a conscience.
- Or just give them hope. - A conscience,
a conscience. We must help them.
- Yes, we must help them.
- Beside us they might learn many things.
- Take it. Are you interested ?
It's a good book. - Thanks.
Let's have a coffee.
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
- Mister Casati is calling.
- Ah, Yes.
Mom, can you do it, please?
(Irene) Yes ? Ah, the baby
is back home? Is he fine ?
(Irene) Thanks, Andrea. No, don't worry.
I'll go there if you can't.
(Irene) Sure, I remember which
bus I should take.
(Irene) I'm going today.
Thanks, Andrea. Goodbye.
- You're happy, eh ?
- Yes, it's good news.
Tell me, Irene: I saw some books,
some magazines around...
- What are you planning?
- I'm doing nothing wrong, mom.
Listen to me... Give me the knit job.
Do you know that in the States
they arrested all communists ?
I understand,
after what happened to you...
But to get to the point to
forget who you are...
(Hamilton) Do you want to end up in a
concentration camp, in case of war ?
(Hamilton) Listen to me:
come with me in England.
- Mom, please...
- What's this got to do with anything?
Listen to me, you who might, mom.
I know what my duties are.
But, see, I'm looking for something...
Don't you understand ?
Well.
Why don't you tell exactly what
you think ? That I've gone crazy !
Don't talk to her like that.
Irene is an intelligent woman.
We can't stop her,
we have to meet her halfawy,...
..wrap her in warmness and care,
as if she was sick and recovering.
(INDISTINCT BUZZING)
- Good morning ! - Good morning !
- Good morning ! How are you ?
- Fine, thanks.
- Bruno, come here.
- Look, he's almost fine now,
- Yes !
- Thank the lady. - Thank you.
- What do have I got to do with it ?
(together) Tell her to thank
all those who helped you !
Lady, how about a glass of wine?
It's good, genuine stuff.
- I believe it. - Really.
- Please have it, lady.
If you wish, I'll introduce you
to many of my good friends.
- Mister Manzetti, responsible
of the consultation. - How do you do.
- This is another dear friend of mine.
- Lady !
He's now jobless, but he used to
work with the railroad police.
- This is my lady.
- How do you do.
- (Galli) Please have a seat !
- Thanks. - Have a seat, Mrs.
(Galli) Be silent now,
Gigetto is going to sing.
# Turn and do the wheel... #
Since I can't sleep with
all these songs in the air,...
..I've come to join the party.
Have a seat.
# Let my friends
listen to my voice. #
She's a prostitute,
she lives around here.
Such things worries those who have

- Please !
- Have a seat ! Goodbye!

I'm glad that she went away !
# Turn and do the wheel... #
- What a voice, eh ?
- He's very good.
#The joy of singing naturally. #
# We're partying for Brunetto

that's my son training.
He's very good,
very promising.
Very promising, but in the meanwhile
he's destroying everyone's ears.
- Just another sip !
- It's time to go.
- Lady, please !
- No, I must go. Goodbye.
- If you really don't want...
- Goodbye. - Thanks.
- Goodbye, dear Manzetti.
- Ciao, Bruno.
- Happy, eh ?
- (Galli) Thanks to all of you.
Nice peole ! But the baby looked
a little tried.
He was always a bit like that,
sick for all these years.
But he'll be fine with some further care.
I was so moving,
all those calm, simple people...
(DRUMMING)
What are you doing ? Stop it !
You must go to play to the ball !
Go ahead !
I'm not gonna eat your son !
Farewell, blonde !
If you knew how many worries
these boys give us !
See, most people here is despaired
for too much misery.
In the seventh lot there's a house
with twelve people sleeping in a room.
Other houses have five, eight,
one on top of the other !
There's everything that's needed
to turn this into an industrial neighoborhhod.
Water, electricity.. There would be work
for everyone. And "Work makes man noble".
Instead they are all farm
and construction workers...
..that find jobs for one or two days
on end in a while.
That's what makes them despaired.

Oh ! Where the hell have you been ?
- And the others ? Where are they ?
- They went to the football match.
What did they do? You, blow your nose, come on!
Daniela, show your brother how.
Yes! Like this !
- Here. Have a seat, lady.
- No, thanks, I don't want to disturb.
Don't worry, please !
Sit down here.
Where did you find them ?
Along the river's edge,
I stepped in because they...
How many times do I have to tell you
that you can't go there ?
Next time I'll beat you !
Sorry, but they always make me live
in anxiety !
You're older and you should have more care !
- They ran away, I tried catching them...
- You should have called me !
Bring him home
and go call yuor brothers.
No, wait, let's give him some bread and
cheese too.
Isn't this child beautiful?
I'd steal him from my mother !
Here, dear! Have a kiss !
Come on, bring him away and call
your brothers ! Tell them to come soon !
- He's beautiful, eh ? - Yes, very much.
How many child have you got ?
- Six. - Six ?!
- They aren't all mine.
- Three are. The other three
I've found them around. - How ?
Found. How do you say ? They were
orphans and I took them with me.
- You like children !
- I'm crazy for them !
I understand. Childrens are beautiful.
You can't understand, but
I have fun with them, that's what.
Look at the state of yours !
Here's the bread !
Take your sandwich, Daniela !
Now go play outside !
Go, dear, go ! Outside !
Come to your mom, dear Daniela !
- Look at her eyes ! Show your teeth
to the lady ! - She's beautiful !
She has the same eyes as her
criminal father !
- Where is he ?
- Gone. - Is he dead ?
Dead ? No, I hope not !
Why, poor him ?
You said: ''Gone''
and I thought...
- No, no. Do you want some ricotta ?
- No, thanks.
Don't be shy, take some !
- Are you separated ?
- You don't understand.
I was in Capranica
for the grain harvesting season.
I met him there,
and you know how these things goes...
- Then he... - He stayed there.
- Did he leave you ?
No, he's a very good man !
But I'm a crazy woman !
I know myself, you know ?
I don't want to be a pain to men.
Men are like babies.
You have to submit because
they believe they are who knows what !

- Is she from the exiles camp ?
- Yes... - I had a friend that came from there.
She worked in a circus.
Ah, here it is !

- I don't want to see you like this anymore.
Promise me. - Yes, don't worry.
I want to see you strong and calm.
In these last days I have discovered
and understood many new things.
I'll hold on to everything I can
in order to forget.
I know, dear.
You must do whatever you wish.
(Andrea) Irene ! Finally !
- How are you, Andrea ?
- Nice to see you !
- I need you.
- What's up? Tell me.
I met a young woman,
with six childs.
She's brave, strong,
calm and intelligent.
She's always able to make it. No luxuries
and no frills, as she says.
She needs a job,
any kind of job.
I think having a job might
fully satisfy her.
Well, I'll do everything I can
in order to have you satisified.
I'm so happy hearing you
talking like this !
Do you remember when you first
arrived in Italy ?
It was in... '47, no ?
Many things happened since
and many things changed.
It was one of the best periods
of my life.
There was so much enthusiasm
and we were always together.
Dear Irene, I would really
like to help you.
(Andrea) And you always knew, Irene,
my feelings for you.
I'll take care of your protegee.
You'll give me her name and address.
Is she working now ?
No. She just defends herself. She tries
to help, she invents hundreds of things.
She's full of dignity, full of life,...
..and she has this great desire
of finding a job.
But her quest is a bit vague
and uncertain.
And so I, with my cool
northern blood,...
..I'm struggling to find a job for her.
It's called a conscience,
a class conscience.
You don't know how important it is
what you've tried to do.
Do you think about it?
A day will come when men
will have absolute faith...
..in an uninterrupted progress,
that might make them...
..masters of the laws of
the universe, masters of life...
It will be paradise, the paradise
of man, wanted by men.
The true paradise.
- Good morning !
- Good morning ! - Oh, you're having lunch !
- No, we're done.
How are you ? - Fine.
I'm a bit late,
I've been very busy!
They ate three kilos of bread
while waiting for the soup !
- Have a seat ! - Maria, come here !
- Go out ! I have to tidy a bit !
Maria, help Daniela
getting down from the seat.
- Be comfortable, Mrs. May
I offer you anything ? - No, thanks.
- A coffee ? A glass of liquor ?
- I've found a job for you.
- Really ? - On wednesday.
- Oh, the chance !
- Now that I've found a job,
such a thing happens... - What ?
See, I met a boy, he was working
here, at the bakery.
- You, go away !
- No, mom ! - Air ! Air !
A small man, with so beautiful
eyes ! A true wonder !
He got called back by the Army.
They sent him to Turin, with the Artillery.
- Well, you know how it goes...
- No, how does it go ? - Wait.
He wrote me they are going to send him
to Bracciano for a couple of days...
..to retrieve the flour
for his battalion.
He can't stop in Rome,
He has to leave immediately,...
..and I would like to go
and visit him.
(Passerotto) I'm entitled
to it, aint' I ?
Sure, none's gonna stop you,
but you'll lose the job !
I should find a remedy
for that:...
..someone should go to the
factory instead of me.

George, I'm starting to worry.
Shouldn't we do something ?
- There's no reason, she knows
very well we're going to the theatre - Thanks.
I don't know, I don't
understand her anymore.
(George) Oh, finally!
What happened ? It's so late !
- Sorry... - We won't make it
to the theatre in time.
- Good evening. - If you don't rush,
we'll lose the first act.
I'm so sorry,
It's late and...
- Oh, Irene ! - You knew
they were coming, didn't you ?
Yes, I did. I forgot all about it.
I hope you will excuse me.
May I ?
- So ?
- Oh, George...
How long should we keep
playing this comedy ?
Sorry. It will end soon.
Just be patient.
No, I have to explain !
I've put up with everything !
I justified
your behaviours,...
..I defended you against your mother,
against your cousin, against everybody !
I said yes to whatever
you told me, but not anymore !
Everything it's perfectly clear now !
Everything you do is a rehearsal,
even your way of dressing !
- (George) You got like this
in order to be liked by him ! - Oh, George...
Those men are masterful when it
comes to conquer troubled souls !
Why do you avoid me ?
You're afraid of even being touched by me ?
If you're in love with Andrea,
why aren't you brave enough to say so ?
It's not honourable for you
to try and deceive me !
For a long time I thought
It was just about Michel,...
..but now I know it had
only been an excuse !
- What are you talking about ?
- Ah, stop, stop, stop !
Oh, no, George ! No !
(GEORGE EXHALES)
- Shut up, stop it !
- George...
(George) Stop it, if you don't want
me to throw a scandal, tonight !
- (George) Don't you dare
saying a single word ! - You're wrong if...
(George) Stop it !
Don't make me lose control !
I don't want to drive you crazy,
but you have to listen.
(George) STOP !
- Stop !
- (Irene) George...
(Man) Sadly people leave
their homes.
Animals start their path
to the new lands.
The objects of cult, witnesses
to the village life,...
..are carried with love.
The strong waters,
sources of enormous energies,...
..are running now into the 
channels made by men,...
..towards the new, great basin.
And these immense natural
forces, ruled and contained...
..will give man
the energy needed to...
..run their industries,
their factories
The sacrifice of few
created new and endless...
..chances of a job>/i>
for many others on end.
I had to feel it, see it,
this job! And I'm terrified !
I know, it's an horrendous
condemnation !
Come on, Irene, ease up a bit
and do not exaggerate.
Belive me, Andrea, I'm not exaggerating.
I saw very well what's it all about.
And to think they want to raise work
to a godlike status !
Don't you suspect you're being
a victim of your first impressions ?
What did you see about work ?
How's the true work life ?
You saw
the slavery of work,...
..but when we'll have
a full working humanity...
The one you dream about
is a monstrous humanity !
I saw them !
They're just slaves in chains !
How could you think
they would be happier ?
At least they would be less unhappy
and there would be more justice.
And nobody will die from fatigue anymore...
..while others are sitting still
watching him.
It might even be true,
but if everybody would understand...
..that work is not just a duty,
but a condemnation...
''You'll earn your bread
by the sweat of your forehead.''
Then, probably,
we'll feel closer,...
..equal, humiliated
in the same way,...
..and we'll search for salvation together.
But I thank you, Andrea,
after all, it was you that brought me to this point.
I know I've been wrong all my life
and there's so little time...
Oh, Michel !
I want to be certain that he knows
how great is my love for everyone.
And this love belongs to him!
I'm sure that, if he could
see his mother...
It might be a tender illusion,...
..but trying to strive,
to see this... How should I call it ?
This heaven on earth more
concretely, I assure you that...
No, Andrea. I would like to have
a faith, an impregnable faith.
In this heaven on earth
there would be no place for Michel,...
..for he isn't alive anymore.
The paradise I dream about it's not just
for the living, but for everyone.
It's eternal.
This is my paradise.

Yes.

- So you helped him escape.
- (Irene) Yes.
It's a crime.

I'm sure the boy will come to be
arrested spontaneously..
He's a poor man. He'll admit his crime.

A mysterious woman
helps robber escape
- Have a seat.
- Dear doctor !
- Good morning, lawyer.
- Mister Gerard.
- How do you do.
- Have a seat.
- Did you have time to study her case ?
- Yes, sure.
On the newspapers somebody insinuated that...
..there was a relationship of sort
between the lady and the boy. What a shame.
I guess that after the boy
spontaneously went to the police,...
..all of this thing just lost
its monumentum.
- (Doctor) Go on.
- But there's another aspect.
The social position of the lady
and her family.
As I told you earlier, after the
death of her child, the lady...
How can I say ? She lost herself,
she did some strange things.
Keep in mind Mister Gerard's
position in Rome.
He's the representative of one of
the most famous american brands.
Him, the lady's mother coming
from America, the family,...
..they did everything they could
to help her...
..up until she, of her
own volition,...
..abandoned her husband.
Is it true that since she went away,
you had no news form her...
..up until today, when you read
about this on the newspaper ?
- Yes, it's true. - Didn't you think
about the idea I told you earlier ?
The hypotesis of putting the lady
in a psychiatric hospital...
..for a period of observation ?
Yes. I alerted the authorities
about that.
I believe it all falls under
the realm of prevention, on your side...
..and in the interest
of lady Gerard.
Maybe then we'll have the chance
to ease this scandal a bit.
Why should I get visited ?
- because the doctor advised you to.
- But I'm fine !
I know. Don't talk now, please,
try to stay calm.
(CAR HORNS)
- (George) Gerard.
- There, at the end of the road.
Good morning. Have a seat.
Come, lady. One moment, please.
(Doctor) I'll soon be there,
don't worry.
Come, lady, come.
- And my husband ?
- He'll reach you in a while.
Help yourself in, please.
Please.
- Is my husband not coming ?
- He'll come, don't worry.
- Is this my room ?
- Yes.
Lady, I brought you a room vest
and the toilet essentials.
If you let me know what you need...
I'll do everything you need.
Cesira, don't act like a child,
i'm perfectly fine.
And I'm counting on you
for the house to run smoothly.
Oh, lady, why is this happening !
You've always been a good woman !
(crying) They didn't have to
close you in here !
Cesira, don't cry.
See, I'm fine enough, here.
Maybe it will be good for me
to be alone with myself, isolated.
I'm calm here. Don't think
that somebody harmed me.
Now that I'm not at home anymore, I'm
trusting you for everything to run smoothly...
..and that Mr. Gerard might
have everything he needs.
Cesira, may I trust you ?
(crying) Yes, sure !
Oh, Lady !
(CESIRA CRIES)
- Where are you taking me?
- The doctor wants to see you. Come.
Everything is normal.

I'll show you some inkblot cards.
Please tell me whatever comes through
your mind, when you see them.
It's vital that you
collaborate actively...
..and please try to give me
as many answers as you can.
Also, do not omit anything
that comes through your mind.
- But this... I don't know, it's nothing.
- What do you mean with "nothing", lady ?
A fierce jumping beast.
A totem.
- And then ?
- A vertebrae.
A bat.
Yes, probably a bat.
(IRENE SIGHS)
Nothing.
Nothing. I don't know.
They're just blots.
I don't know what to say.
(sighing) It's so ridiculous.
I don't know how to reply.
Please, stop it,
it's really ridiculous.
(whispering) Something happened
to me and I can't solve it.
(whispering) I would like
a word of advice.
- Good morning, reverend.
- Good morning.
(whispering) So if I...
- But I must talk to the father !
- Stay calm.
- It's important.
- We'll talk later. I'm staying.
- Is that the new patient,
Mrs. Gerard ? - Yes.
- May I speak to her ?
- Sure. Go on, please.
- What do you want from me ?!
- What's up ?
- I don't want anything to do with you!
Who are you?! - Don't you know me ?
- Good morning. - Good morning.
- How are you ? - Fine, thanks.
I would like to talk to you.
Nobody told me to do it.
I met your husband.
You know, he comes everyday
to have news about you.
We spoke for long, it was
really enlightening.
- So, I thought of visiting you.
- Yes...
In our clerical practice we learn
to understand many things.
Don't think I want to judge you
for leaving your home,...
..or for being interested
in another man.
No, you are wrong.
I know my husband believed it,
but it isn't true.
Let me explain:
there comes a time when...
..love for our dearest ones
is not enough anymore.
I felt it was too selfish,
shabby.
And i felt compelled to get
close to the others,...
..the humbles, any of the humbles,
and love them.
This goes to prove yours is a christian feeling.
Anyway, even love has rules that
need to be respected.
Surely you ain't sure you need
to abandon your husband...
..for the sake of a feeling,
as vast as it might be.
We must do good, but carefully,
as God's will dictates.
No, love has no measures.
Evil sprouts from the fact that
we don't give all our love...
..to those who mostly need it.
We must love them for what they are
and help them the best we can.
God created us as such.
How sad it is to be suddenly aware
that in life...
..we have been deserters towards
others and towards ourselves.
So you would like to...
be a reformer.
Did you think about it? Do you
you think you could have such a strength?
I don't know.
All I know is that I've been, and
still am, too selfish.
I try to give others all the love
I have. Which isn't mine.
Only then a great light
descends within me.
An immense good possesses me
without me invoking it.
Just then mountains could
really be moved.
Do you firmly believe
in God and his own Grace ?
What I know is that we need to
live full of love for everyone else.
What matters is that men might
save themselves,...
..that the whole world might.
''I came not on earth to lose sinners,
but to save them''
This is the miracle
of Christianity.
Where did you read those things ?
Who told them to you ?
- Nobody.
- These are words from the Gospels.
I've been a sinner myself.
I... am in turmoil.
Aren't you afraid of the
life you are choosing ?
(KNOCKS ON THE DOOR)
Why should I be afraid?
- Stay calm.
- Why is everybody afraid ?
Why are  you afraid, even ?
Do you think I'm crazy?
- Ester ! Maria ! Help !
- What happened ?!
(PANIC SCREAMS)
Wait !
(SIGHS AND MOANS OF THE WOMAN)
You're not alone.
Stay calm. I'll be with you.
I'm here with you.
- May I ? Good morning, Lady.
- Good morning. - You may go.
How are you ?
Do you feel fine here ?
Is there something we might
do for you ?
See, in here we like to...
..establish calm and serene
relationships.
I know what happened
earlier today.
That poor woman attempted
suicide... An unfortunate thing.
Despite the most severe precautions
it's hard to predict...
..what lenghts might
an obsessed woman go.
Anyway, I would like to thank you.
You're a very brave woman.
No, I'm not brave at all.
Tell me: how could you do it ?
Did you feel a strength within ?
That mysterious strength that pushes us
towards the suffering ones...
..with the most exact, lovely
and strong desire...
..to help them,
free them, save them ?
Do you feel such a strength ?
No... no...
I don't know, I don't know...
If my informations
are correct...
That criminal, the one from the robbery...
I can't recall his name.
He has been led by
the same strength...
..a strength common between
the greater souls.
Had I believed myself
to be a great soul,...
..I would have been crazy.
And so is love, love
towards others, true love.
- No, it's hate.
- Hate ?
Love towards others springs
from the hate I feel towards myself.
For everything that is and have been mine.
It isn't anything else.
- Good morning, judge.
- Good morning. Have a seat.
I have come to talk to you
about Mrs. Gerard case,...
..she has been interned in
a psychiatric clinic.
- How is she ?
- Well...
- I brought you her medical file,
so you'll see. - Well.
(Lawyer) I think it's time
to take a decision.
I think we should see to
her definitive internment.
- (Lawyer) Then, with time...
- In the meanwhile, please leave the files here.
Anyway, I'll need to meet her,
and her relatives...
..her doctor, whoever has been
around her since her child's death.
- Sure you should.
- We could meet all of them at the clinic.
It would be the best thing to do,
to avoid further annoyances.
I've read your perusal,
I've spoken with her relatives...
..and to all those involved...
..with her life during
the last few months.
Please explain me your diagnosis.
We're facing one of those cases
for which maybe we'll never find..
..an organic, physical analogue
for her mental sickness.
One might think that the strange
products of those brains...
I'll try to be simpler.
Eeven in the absence of organic wounds,
the thoughts of these individuals...
..are doubtlessly to be considered
exceptional anomalies.
Even geniuses are
exceptional anomalies.
Sure, but there are distinctions
to be made...
..one of them fundamental,
and we must take it into account...
..for the decisions we
need to make.
It is based on a concept of value.
Such anomalies are to be
considered damaging,...
..when they disrupt the normal
life of a person...
..diminishing the capacity to
adapt to social life.
When social and religious ideas
are discussed...
..it's difficult to give
absolute judgements.
Especially today... there's no truth anymore!
Everything is seduction and propaganda!
So, are we in front of a missionary
or of an exhalted person?
Had the lady followed,
even with a fanatical fervor,...
..a religious or
a political creed... but as such...
Should we opt for Mrs. Gerard
to be right,...
..we should then strip of our
professional clothes, and follow her.
Sure, but then maybe we
won't be brave enough.
How many men that society condemned
as rebels in their days...
and burnt at stakes were right ?
Sure, but our call is to
defend society as it is...
..with its laws,
within its actual asset.
If wrong, we'll be judged
and condemned.
Lady, Irene is coming. Try not to
display your emotions, when you see her.
Daniela !
- Good morning !
- How are you, Mrs. ? - Fine, thanks.
- Good morning, Mrs. !
- How are you ?
Take the child.
George...
Please, would you sit down ?
Good morning, Mrs. Please have a seat.
Mrs., we are here to look
after your interests...
..we are here to protect you.
(Judge) You can speak freely,
don't be afraid.
- What do you want to know ?
- Are you a communist ? - No.
- (Judge) Do you wish to be a nun?
- No.
(Judge) So,
what are your ideals ?
- I know you worked in a factory.
- Yes.
(Judge) So, tell me: what are
your feelings, your reactions?
(IRENE CRIES)
(crying) Stop it...
Don't cry. It's important for
you to tell me everything.
Be exact, please. What are
your programs, your ideals ?
The ideals of those who need me
day after day.
Help me understand. What kind
of feelings move you?
(Judge) If going back to your house,
to your husband...
No. What good would it be,
to be back home ?
It won't save nor me nor the others.
It would be really easy
to return, really easy...
But I'll be back being what
I was before all of this.
Instead, I want to share the joy
of the happy,...
..the pain of the suffering,...
..and the anguish of those who despair...
I'd rather lose myself with others,
then saving myself on my own.
Only the one who is completely free
might blend in with all the others.
Only the one who is bound to nothing
is bound to all human beings.
This is what I feel.
And now I've told you everything.
I have nothing to add.
I spoke freely.
And now, you'll freely do what you
believe you should, for your own good.
Please help me to my room.
- Irene ! - Here's the lady !
- What happened to her ?
Nothing. Don't worry.
- Go away, childrens.
- Lady, but...
- What happened ?
- Unluckily, it's like we thought.
I want to see my daughter !
Mrs. Hamilton wishes to see
her daughter.
The lady wishes to see
Mrs. Gerard. Please, lead her there.
Please, Mrs., come with me.
- Dear judge...
- Eh...
Irene, Irene...
It's all for your own good, believe me !
- We only care for your own good.
- Yes, I know, but stay calm.
- (crying) My heart is breaking !
Irene, dear daughter ! - Stay calm, mom.
Farewell, George.
Farewell, Irene.
- (Man) What did you do ?
- (Woman) Will you leave her here ?
- (Man) What are you doing ?
- (Woman) She is not crazy !
(''Passerotto'') She's a saint !
A saint ! Lady ! Lady !
- (Man) It's an injustice !
- (''Passerotto'') Poor dear !
(crying) She's a saint,
she's a saint !
