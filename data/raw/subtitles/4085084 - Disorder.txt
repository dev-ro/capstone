Right.
Left.
Look straight ahead.
Left or right?
Left... I mean right.
Left or right?
Right.
How many tranquillisers are you taking?
I stopped taking them.
So you're sleeping better?
- No more nightmares or migraines?
- That's right.
Do you have a girlfriend at the moment?
No.
What about sexual relations?
Everything OK?
Just fine.
Then everything's great!
So why are you bleeding?
I don't know.
Listen. We've gone over your test results.
You have hearing loss.
Cardiac stress test,
concentration... not good.
I'm not sure we can take responsibility
for sending you back out.
I want to go back.
You'll receive the final decision by post.
Don't take it that way.
Your anxiety, the hallucinations...
It's the after-effects.
What's happening to you
happens to lots of men who come back.
- Let me off here.
- Wait for the next stop.
No. Stop here, please.
Thank you.
Mum?
Where the fuck were you?
- Hey, dude.
- Chill, we're on time.
What's the guy do?
- Who?
- The place we're going.
- No idea. He's Lebanese.
- Lebanese?
- Yeah. You got a problem with it?
- No.
Protecting Arabs will be a nice change.
It's 500 a day.
- It's better than the first gig.
- Yeah.
Nothing to write home about.
- Remember Malta?
- How much did that pay?
800? 800 a day?
Yeah, something like that.
- Is that it here?
- That's it.
Hi. We're the security staff.
You can get ready in here.
I'll let you get changed. I'll be back.
Everything got screwed up last time
cos of him.
What happened?
They fucked up the logistics.
We were stuck out there like idiots.
Who's on your team?
Same guys as last time.
- Michael's the field leader.
- Shit, good luck!
Yeah, he's a real arsehole.
Did anyone get smokes?
No.
What's that ugly tie?
You look like shit in civvies.
Check out Vincent.
He looks like he's getting married.
Gentlemen, if you're ready,
it's time to go.
- Where do we start?
- In the garden?
- Franck and Vincent, you got the house?
- OK.
- Vincent, you get the upstairs?
- Yeah, I'm coming.
Guys, the place is big.
Make sure you check out
every nook and cranny.
I've got five extra men on the grounds.
We'll need them.
Who are they?
Just backup.
We'll be in charge of the house.
Has anyone checked the staff
for new employees?
Yeah.
- Vincent?
- Yeah?
- Vincent!
- Yes, I'm here.
- Where are you?
- I'm in the living room.
The living room with the big sofa?
I don't see you.
- You see me now?
- No, I can't see you. Move.
- Here?
- OK, I see you.
- OK.
- Too many fucking blind spots.
OK. The hallway looks good.
Vincent, you there?
Vincent?
Vincent, can you hear me?
Mummy, what time is it?
What's the big hand for?
I'm on the phone, honey.
Didn't Franck check that?
Come on. It's time for the briefing.
This shit's good.
Come on, guys, let's start. You listening?
You saw the stairs
leading down to the storeroom?
- That'll be our assembly point. OK?
- OK.
The emergency exit route
is through the back.
Left after the courtyard.
Tom, here's the guest list.
You take the main entrance.
- Look, the Prime Minister!
- No, that's the Minister of the Interior.
OK, guys. Radio check.
- Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Copy.
- Copy.
- How's the front gate?
- People are still coming in.
- You need backup?
- No, it's cool. Kevin's here.
The VIP parking area is almost full.
So what do I do?
Don't forget to save
spaces for the politicians.
Is the minister here yet?
No.
You see the bleached blonde
with the boobs?
- Which one?
- Two o'clock.
You think they're fake?
Is that his wife or daughter?
Knock it off with that crap. Stay focused.
Oh, we are!
Did you hear Duroy's speech?
It was great. Absolutely amazing.
He's sitting right over there.
How do you expect me to pay them
if I haven't been paid?
Excuse me.
Could I have some ice?
- Some what?
- Ice cubes.
You see the villa? Whalid's doing well.
Better than you, for sure.
Yeah, he's made a big pile of cash.
Lebanese style.
Hey, he's French.
Yeah. He might be French.
He'll soon get on Duroy's nerves.
You sure Whalid won't screw us?
- Why?
- I don't know.
If anything leaks about Qatar,
the presidential elections are dead.
Relax. Duroy's Minister of the Interior now.
We can handle shit like this.
Did you see? The polls keep rising.
Yeah, the legislative list looks good.
Our platform is popular.
Duroy's candidacy is imminent.
Vincent, it's Denis.
- Vincent, it's Denis.
- Come in.
Come to the front gate, would you?
What for?
- Hurry up, I need you.
- OK, I'm coming.
Good evening, sir.
- Mr Duroy.
- Hello, Mr Minister.
You can go to the VIP parking area.
It's around the back of the house.
Someone will be waiting for you.
Have a nice evening, sir.
Take the list. I'll be right back.
- Good evening.
- I'm with the minister.
- Your name, please?
- Derradji. Tarik.
Your name isn't on the list.
I'll have to ask you to clear the way.
Yeah. Call me back.
I have a problem
with some moron at the gate.
Clear the way, please.
Yes? I'm right out front.
Yeah, I'll pass you over. It's for you.
Hello?
Fine. Understood.
Go on, it's cool. Go ahead.
Hey, Vincent!
What's wrong with you?
Take this. I'll be back.
You think everyone's been paid?
Our people over there
haven't received their share yet.
Only in the contract clauses.
Our agreement clearly stipulates
that you're paid last,
once all the commissions have been paid.
Which is not the case.
What are you saying? Is this a threat?
I wouldn't advise that.
Change your tone.
Everything all right, sir?
Yes. Wait for me outside.
Of course.
How much did you overhear?
Nothing, sir.
Go and find my wife.
- Go on.
- Of course.
Vincent for Denis.
- What?
- Whalid's looking for his wife. Seen her?
- Vincent, you arsehole, where are you?
- I'm looking for his wife.
- What's she like?
- Blonde.
They're all blonde. What else?
I don't know, a blonde
in a dress with flowers and no back.
Oh, yeah,
I know who you're talking about.
Have you seen her or not?
- I saw her by the pool earlier.
- OK, thanks.
Ghost! Come here. Are you hungry?
Excuse me.
Your husband's looking for you.
All right.
- Did you find her?
- Yes, it's cool. She just left the kitchen.
Here you go.
What's wrong with you? Huh?
Come on.
Come outside with me.
Vince!
Come on.
What's up?
Whalid's leaving for two days.
He needs someone for his family.
3,000 euros a week.
900 euros for two days.
Why are you asking me?
Why ask you?
You need money and you're my pal.
You don't think they'll send me back, huh?
Cut the crap. You'll see.
Why don't you do it yourself?
Make up your mind or I'll ask Franck.
It's baby-sitting, it's nothing.
You chat, play chauffeur,
take them shopping...
- Yeah.
- Take them to the beach...
- I said OK.
- Then you'll stay here?
- I'll be back around noon, is that OK?
- Cool.
Vincent?
- He's over there.
- Thanks.
You're looking good. OK?
- And you?
- Fine.
- You got the Ultram?
- Yeah.
Some Acupan too. It's the same thing.
Go easy on the Rivotril.
Ten drops, no more.
Yeah, I know.
- There's no more Lyrica?
- Nope, I'm out.
Come back tomorrow afternoon.
I'll ask around.
- I can't, I'm working.
- You're working tomorrow?
That's cool.
- Yes?
- Hello. Home security, Vincent Loreau.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- Here's your room.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Is there anything to eat?
There's some leftover spaghetti
on the stove, if you like.
Thank you.
And you, eat!
Imad!
I'll call you when I get to Geneva.
It's only 48 hours.
That does not reassure me in the least.
Why do you have to go again?
I'll be back in two days.
What's going on?
Don't worry.
Excuse me, I need to lock up.
What I want
is to set France in motion.
And I want to do it
with the support of all,
in a modern country where
people do not occupy factories
or burn cars.
Mr Duroy, there are rumours
concerning your campaign funding
and foreign accounts.
Listen. I understand
that my candidacy might be disturbing.
But we mustn't stoop this low.
I know who's behind these accusations.
But when you've nothing to reproach
yourself with, it can't affect you.
Do you foresee an alliance
with the centre?
Today, right, left, centre...
These political concepts are outdated.
What matters is the desire
to unite the French people.
French people who want to change things
without ideologies
or preconceived notions.
Hello?
Is there a problem?
No. It was a wrong number.
Don't worry, I'm here if anything happens.
- Go on up to bed.
- Mummy!
What's wrong with you?
You hungry?
Sorry to disturb you.
Do you mind if I get some coffee?
Go ahead.
Would you like some?
I'll have a cup.
Thank you.
It's cold, don't you think?
Coffee doesn't keep you up?
I don't sleep much these days anyway.
I wake up every three hours.
In the army, it's two-hour increments.
- You were in the army?
- I still am.
Then what are you doing here?
We always pick up odd jobs
between missions.
Are you going to leave again?
Yes.
Do you hear that?
What?
The birds.
You don't hear them?
No.
Would you like some?
Yeah. Thanks.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Come on.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
We're going to the beach.
We'll wait for you in the car?
What about running for president?
You know, the French people
are weary of speeches.
What they want
is to stand on their own feet.
- They want jobs.
- Go on, get in.
It's time to take radical measures.
You got your seatbelt on?
Turn right onto the road.
Excuse me?
Turn right
at the end of the driveway, please.
What are you doing?
Stop the car!
Stop the car now!
Are you deaf or what?
- Someone was following us.
- Who?
Get out.
Shit.
4-8-8-9.
Come on now.
Go on, run ahead.
Ali!
Leave him alone.
Come on, Ali. We're going home.
What do you want Souad
to make you for dinner tonight?
I don't know.
Would you like pizza?
- Chips?
- No.
Are you tired?
Go on, get in.
- Can you get it?
- Yes.
Fasten your seatbelt. There.
Ali, get down!
No!
Don't move, OK? Look at me. Don't move.
Get down.
She says she doesn't know anything.
I'll take care of him.
Please follow me.
What exactly do you do for Mr Whalid?
I told your partner.
I watch his family when he's gone.
He didn't leave you anything?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
OK. That'll be all.
There's no statement to sign?
No.
That's all. You can go.
- Can I have my gun?
- No, we'll keep it for now.
OK, come on.
Don't worry. We'll provide surveillance.
You'll be fine.
Why did they question you so much?
- Mummy?
- You OK, sweetheart?
Are you warm?
Want me to open the window?
Let's count the red cars.
Why did they question you so much?
- They were asking about my husband.
- Oh, yeah?
They only asked me questions
about him, too. Strange, huh?
You don't find that strange?
They didn't give a damn
about us being attacked.
No one's answering.
Come on.
Wait for me here.
Souad? Souad!
No one's here.
- Where are Souad and Hassin?
- No idea.
Maybe they let the guys in.
Hello? Yes.
But why?
When?
Is there anything I can do?
How long will they keep him?
OK, but... Yes.
Of course, I'll stay here.
You'll call me back?
Yes.
My husband was arrested
at the Swiss border.
- Who was that?
- His lawyer.
We should go somewhere else.
No, we'll stay here.
It's not a good idea.
I said we're staying here. OK?
The police are coming.
As you wish.
There's a car outside. I'll see who it is.
OK.
Roc, come here!
- It's nothing. Just the police.
- OK.
Ali, wash your hands.
Ali, right now!
Come on.
When your mum says do something,
you do it. OK?
Use the soap.
Eat while it's warm.
I'm not hungry.
You have to eat.
You'll get weak if you don't.
My name is Vincent.
I'm Jessie.
What does your husband really do?
Want me to tell you?
He's an arms dealer.
He negotiates arms contracts, right?
Ali, it's time for bed.
What are the papers you were looking at?
You have to tell me what's going on.
Otherwise I can't help you.
Do you understand? Look at me.
I want to help you, that's all.
Go and get them.
Stop poring over them.
You won't understand anyway.
You think it's too complicated for me?
Don't look at me like that.
You think I'm stupid?
Your husband put you in deep shit.
- I don't get involved in his business.
- No.
But you make the most of it, all the same.
Do you make the most of it or not?
What's wrong?
You're afraid of me?
I'm the one who frightens you?
Answer me.
It's OK.
I said it's OK.
- Do you need anything?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
OK.
Excuse me...
Yes?
If things go wrong,
do you have anywhere to go?
Family? Friends?
No.
Don't tell me you only have your husband.
- I have a girlfriend in Canada, but...
- But what?
All you need's a plane ticket.
What are you doing here?
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- I can't sleep.
Let's go.
Think of nice things.
Like, maybe you could
imagine a big lake?
You're swimming happily.
Have you ever been to Canada?
No, I've never been. And you?
I think you'd like it.
- Why do you say that?
- I don't know.
I can picture you there.
Not in the cities, in the nature.
It's big. There are lots of lakes.
I can see you hunting bears.
It's true.
I'm sorry.
What did you say the name was?
Imad Whalid.
Please hold.
Hello?
I'm calling about Mrs Whalid's
police protection.
We were with you this afternoon.
Yes, my partner told me.
But what's this about protection?
The report doesn't say anything.
What do you mean? There was
a car outside the house. It just left.
Hang on.
Her protection was removed.
When?
I can't tell you anything else.
Those were our orders.
Hello?
Hello?
Your protection was called off.
- Hey, Denis, it's me.
- Yeah?
I need you.
What's wrong? You sound funny.
- I'm telling you, I need you. It's serious.
- Why?
Can you come over right now?
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later, OK?
Yeah?
You're sure no one was out there?
- You got a good look?
- I said yes.
This is Denis.
- Hello, I'm Jessie.
- Hello.
Have a seat.
What's your name?
- His name is Ali.
- Ali? Hi, Ali.
I'm Denis. You want something to drink?
I've got Coke, orange juice, water...
Whisky?
Here, eat your cornflakes.
- That's not my usual cereal.
- What?
That's not my usual cereal.
That's all there is. It'll have to do.
You want something else, sweetie?
Some toast?
You eat what there is!
- You hear me?
- That's enough.
Don't talk to him like that.
What's the deal with her?
She said she wants to stay here.
You keep saying the same thing.
What do you care?
You think people leave
papers like that lying around?
You need to get a grip.
Go and get some fresh air.
Please open the door.
We have to get out of here.
Trust me.
Could you take us to the airport
tomorrow morning?
She's going to see a friend in Canada.
I thought I might go with them.
- You're going with them?
- Yeah, why not?
What'll you do over there?
Take care of her and the boy.
You?
What's so strange about that?
I don't know. Did she ask you to go?
I don't know.
Did she ask you or not?
I said, I don't know.
We were in Afghanistan together.
I came back sooner cos I was wounded.
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.
Then you know him well.
Yeah, I know him well.
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?
Coming back isn't easy, you know.
You're not the same as before.
What do you mean?
In his head, he's still over there.
- I see.
- That's the way it is.
What about you? You're American?
- No. German.
- German?
- No big deal, it could happen to anyone.
- Thanks a lot!
You don't have an accent.
Sure I do, a little.
Barely.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- So you're German?
- Yep. Hasn't changed.
- And you speak German?
- Sometimes.
- Fluently?
- Yes.
That's wonderful.
I know how to say...
Of course, what else?
You're so lame.
Jessie is short for Jessica?
Yes. Jessie is short for Jessica.
I've got something for you.
Now what?
- You know this song?
- Nope.
- You like it?
- Very much.
- It's cool.
- Oh, yeah, you like it?
That's enough.
No way!
OK, stop it. That's enough.
I'm a dickhead?
- Am I a dickhead?
- No.
Go and see if the kid is sleeping.
Go on.
I think I'll see if the kid is sleeping.
Stay here.
Stay with me.
Follow me.
- Are you with the kid?
- I don't know where he went.
Stay upstairs. I'll call you
when I have the cameras.
- Yeah?
- It's me. Someone's in the office.
- Ali!
- Stay here!
Look at me. Calm down.
Here, it's loaded. Hold it with two hands.
If anyone comes,
you shoot without thinking.
I'll get Ali and come back.
Lock the door, OK?
OK.
- Go back inside.
- What's going on?
- Go back inside.
- What?
Get inside!
Stay in there.
This is Denis, please leave a message.
Ali!
Ali, it's me.
Come here.
Come on, hold on tight.
Hang on.
Look at me. You stay right here.
Come here, hold on tight.
Hey, come on.
Everything will be fine.
Everything's clear.
You stay here, OK?
Hey, Vincent.
We gotta go. There's no time to waste.
It's OK. Take them to the airport.
You're not coming?
OK.
I'll put your bag in the boot.
Where's Vincent?
- He's not coming with us?
- No, he's not.
Come on, it's time to go. Grab your bag.
Vincent.
