"I just have trouble understanding
how truth, all by itself...
...could be enough for a person."
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
We meet at last, dragon herder.
You've finally found
someone from our family.
I expect they'll give you
a fat promotion now.
I have nothing personally
against you or your family, son.
You commit crimes and
I try to hunt you down.
Looks like the love of your
profession has softened your brains.
You haven't been
doing anything...
...but sniffing the trails of
our father for the past 17 years.
But I got you, didn't I?
Now calmly, turn around and
put your hands on the car.
What are you accusing me of?
Drug trafficking, extortion,
political blackmail...
...murder, ordering killings.
Shall I go on?
Don't you know what my family
will do to you if you arrest me?
Nothing will happen.
I'll arrest them too.
You've been singing the same song
for years like a blind beggar.
You have no idea
where my father is.
Well, I got you, son.
And I shall get your old man, too.
I thought only prophets could see
from the back of their heads.
Commit no more sins, son.
Turn around, put your hands
on the car.
You can't arrest me.
You have no evidence whatsoever.
Now, how's that as evidence?
Is that good enough?
No, Musa Rami. It's not!
You will from now, walk
arm in arm with the Grim Reaper!
My family will hunt you down!
They'll make you pay it bitterly!
You will pray to die!
Surprise!
Happy birthday, dad!
Haluk, my son.
What a lovely surprise!
- Dad...
- When did you get here?
We landed two hours ago.
You came all the way
from London just for me?
I would do anything
for you, dad!
Oh, son! My dear son!
Dad, this is Yo Yo Ma.
You mentioned her
in your letters.
How do you do, sir?
She speaks Turkish, too!
Very well my dear, how do you do?
Oh, come on, that's enough.
It's our turn.
Daddy... Your crazy daughter
is here, give us a kiss.
Give a hug to grandpa, Ece!
- Happy birthday, grandpa!
Ece, my love... Thank you!
I told them we should go out and
have a picnic or something.
It's been a long time
since we had one.
I said dad loves it,
he likes fries...
...boiled eggs and
all that picnic stuff.
Protein, dad.
Lots of protein.
Mum!
- Oh, for Allah's sake!
- Oh dear! What is this, honey?
Nothing. Just a stupid tie.
You can open it later.
Thank you, sweetheart!
Happy birthday, dad!
Thank you, Nihat!
Shouldn't you be on duty tonight?
He got two hours off by giving
your name, dad. Happy birthday.
Thank you, my dear!
Come on, tell him.
What does she have to tell?
Come on then.
- Speak or I'll pistol-whip you!
- Nihat, don't do that!
- Ý am scared, grandpa.
- Don't scare the kid.
Your dad is just teasing you.
Didem has drawn a picture
for you, dad!
But she dropped it on the way here,
and it got smeared with mud.
It's even better like this...
It gives it a realistic touch.
Oh, everyone's here!
You really surprised me!
Daddy! Happy birthday!
Thank you, my dear!
Daddy, what happened to you?
Was it work?
You must be tired of this.
Derya, stop it, leave him alone!
Happy birthday, dad!
Why should I stop, Dündar?
See how old he is?
And he has blood on his shirt.
It's alright. He'll take it off now
and put this one on.
Thank you very much!
If you don't like the color, pop in
the store and we'll exchange it.
I'm sure I'll like it, Dündar.
Come on Can, you give
your present to grandpa, too.
- Take it!
- Be polite!
- What is inside?
- Shit.
Don't, honey!
He is just a kid!
We don't tolerate
that kind of language, dad!
He's become obscene!
Come here, don't cry! Come here!
Ah, she's taking a photograph!
Yes. It's ready.
Everybody say cheese!
As you all know, Volkan Izmitli,
the youngest son...
...of the notorious
Izmitli mafia family...
...was taken dead last night.
This is the first time
an Izmitli was taken red handed.
We found 8 kilograms of cocaine
in his car...
...7 guns,
6 of which were unregistered.
The cocaine and guns
strengthen our case.
This also marks another achievement
to the successful career...
...of Detective Rami which
as always, he will undoubtedly deny.
A detective attempting such a job
on his own is unfathomable...
...even if that detective is
Musa Rami.
Now let's hear
what the detective has to say.
Yes detective, is there
anything you'd like to add?
I don't have anything to add,
thank you.
Maybe you'd like
to share with us...
...how you obtained the
intelligence for this operation.
Not really.
Everything I had to say,
I've already put in my report.
I am tired, I want out, I have
other things in mind right now.
Detective...
Why did you do this?
I just followed up a piece of
information I obtained, Captain.
Detective, everybody in the
department respects you...
...no doubt about that.
But you have shoved us all
in a snake pit.
Don't you think
that requires an explanation?
Funda shall be here shortly.
Detective, we deal with death,
not muses.
That's why we have to be
a little more reasonable...
Yilmaz, listen, son. I am a cop,
I don't need to be reasonable.
I sense, I smell, I trace and
I do whatever has to be done.
But if the department cannot
live with that, then tell me...
...and I will retire immediately.
Detective, no one would even
think of asking you to retire.
But I am under tremendous pressure.
There was no need
for this Izmitli operation.
You've waved a cape awashed
with blood to a herd of bulls.
Payidar Izmitli,
has lots of connections.
He controls key bureaucrats.
And you have hit him
where it hurts most.
My advisor is very pleased with
the two files you have submitted.
I'll include them in
my thesis exactly as they are.
I am glad it helped, Funda.
But he told me
he has some doubts...
...concerning the authenticity
of the reports.
But those are post-operation
reports, Funda. They are all real.
Really? For example that body
with fourteen bullet wounds?
Fourteen? Ýt should be eighteen,
as far as I remember.
Because I had two guns.
According to the report,
you fired at close range.
Meaning, two shots
should have been enough.
I shot him fourteen times, yes.
I had to be certain. You take
your coffee with one sugar, right?
- No, with two sugars please.
- Alright.
At times you have
to be certain, Funda.
And to kill is
to be certain.
In fact, theoretically, it is not
possible to kill someone with a gun.
Knowing this,
you keep on shooting...
...to ensure
you carry it through.
Now...
You can never get
zero by halving a number.
You get smaller pieces each time,
but they never diminish.
This is also valid
for moving objects.
Just think about it for a second.
A bullet, fired from a pistol and...
...traveling gracefully through
the air towards a certain target...
...always halves the
distance it has to travel.
Since you can never get zero
by halving a number...
...theoretically, a bullet
can never reach its target.
You get it? This creates panic
and so, you keep on shooting.
And, the guy is shot, literally...
Or the woman...
Or the woman... Sure.
Great professional reflexes.
Once, we got a call.
"Servet Pembe's corpse is lying...
...on the 6th floor of the
Samandira Business Center."
I thought I was going
to find the fat body...
...of a middle aged trashy
accountant, but Servet Pembe...
...turned out to be a 22 year old
blonde with appreciable looks.
The killer must have been
a woman hater.
The killer was his wife...
His wife?
I never said Servet Pembe
was a woman, I only said blonde.
What happened to your
sociologist's reflexes?
I am going to graduate soon,
so I left them at school.
You think grave-diggers bury
their shovels when they retire?
What do you mean?
Imagine a novice grave-digger
digging a hole somewhere.
He suddenly comes up...
Trucks! Ýt amazes me how
those giant things with...
...those heavy loads
can run that effortlessly.
If I retire one day, I'd like to
become a truck driver and...
...travel on international roads.
Have you ever been overseas?
Yes... I have been to Moscow.
Stayed there for six months.
Really?
Yes. But it was extremely cold,
so i came back.
What did you go to Moscow for?
To attend a chess class.
In high school, I won...
...the 1st Prize in the Balkans
High School Chess Championship.
I have also won many prizes and
medals in national tournaments.
Goodness! Really?
Yes, and now I attend
tournaments at university.
It is a nationwide tournament
but there is a Kazakh guy.
- He is really good...
- Kazakh?
I mean from Kazakhstan.
He is an exchange student.
He thrashes everybody.
I believe we'll meet in the final.
I'll be graduating this semester.
So this is my last chance
to win the University Championship.
But it looks as though
he's going to beat me, Mr. Musa.
It scares me.
Mr. Musa?
I'm surprised to see you here.
How are you?
You left your pen on my desk.
Why did you bother?
It could've waited until
our next meeting.
But we didn't plan to
meet again.
That's true. And you have
so many other things to do, too.
Why don't we meet somewhere
outside next time.
Sure, why not? Well...
Where would you like to meet?
- Ýt doesn't matter.
What about Taksim?
In Yesil Cafe.
Tuesday, 2 o'clock,
how does it sound?
In Taksim, Yesil Cafe.
Tuesday, 2 o'clock... Sounds fine.
And I'll bring along
new dossiers for you.
Alright, then.
My thesis will be terrific.
Well, I have got to go,
I have a class.
Have a good class.
May Allah give you wisdom.
Has anything happened lately
that really agitated you?
Three things happened: I killed a 25
year old man named Volkan Izmitli.
And another one with him.
I caused one person to go blind
and another one deaf.
And a fourth one, if lucky,
will not be able to talk anymore.
I heard all that on the news.
Anything else?
Haluk came from London.
I wasn't expecting him.
I was really excited and elated.
Three things, you said.
Yes, and there is Funda.
I'm in love with her.
What?
She is a student. She's 23.
She has huge, beautiful eyes.
I am sure she has.
I am planning to marry her.
But I haven't told her anything yet.
Why don't you put your shirt on?
Has nothing happened
that bothered you lately?
Heart burn, nausea, vomiting,
anything like that?
Yes, a few times but
I didn't take it too seriously.
You have a large brain tumor, Musa.
You have cancer.
- And am I going to die?
- We all are.
How much time do I have left?
Two months, at most.
You have to rest...
Am I going to live
three months if I do?
No. But you'll suffer less.
Am I going to lose consciousness?
Maybe towards the end.
But, you will still feel the pain.
- She has lovely eyes. Huge eyes.
- What?
Her eyes... Funda's eyes...
They are beautiful.
You were scared.
You were scared to even listen.
With the death of his uncle,
the Prophet Muhammad...
...was left with no one
to protect him.
He was no longer safe in Mecca.
Oh, what is this, a waiting lounge?
Is this a patience testing lab
or what?
My son, Haluk...
Dad... I wanted to see you
before I left.
Are you leaving? But you
only just came yesterday!
I must go dad.
I only managed to take two days off.
I wish you had attended
Friday prayers while you were here.
How are you, my dear?
Thank you...
Your son is here. I'm sure
you couldn't care less about us.
Hold this, will you?
I'll be back in about
an hour and a half.
And don't forget to get
my prescription on Monday.
Those medicines
are very expensive...
...I can't even afford to buy a bra.
You wouldn't want
your daughter's breasts to sag.
They are really expensive, dad.
Now, take her home right away.
She's starving.
There is some pizza in the fridge,
heat it up!
You can have some, too.
See you later, love.
When will you come again?
Bring this sweety along again.
She is so sweet!
Dad, baby... Ciao!
My sister, she does not look
good to me this time.
I guess she has probably stopped
taking her medication.
Ece, my love, will you go and
play with Yo Yo Ma?
Come on.
- Come back in two months.
- Ýn two months? Why?
It's my turn, to have a surprise
for you. You have got to come...
Alright. I'll try my best.
Try and come...
And marry this girl.
You can't go on like this
for long.
Look, grandpa! A fish!
Let's throw it back to the sea
so it'll find its mum.
Find its mum?
Of course. Its mum must be
worried about it.
Okay. Let it go to its mum.
Grandpa?
- Go and get another one.
- Ok!
We'll pull your soul out of you.
You messed with Izmitli!
You are in deep shit!
Be polite, son...
Why all that dirty talk?
Ece... Come here, my love.
Yes, grandpa?
Let's see you
hit this gentleman.
- How do you mean?
- Like this, look!
Hit him! Like that! Yes!
That's good!
Hit him, my little one...
Hit him...
- Grandpa...
- Yes, my dear?
That man, did he go to
his mum as well?
Which man, sweety?
You know, the man that
we threw in the sea?
Ah, that man.
- He's gone back to his mother's...
- To his mother's what?
He's gone to his mother. Yes.
His mother is actually a jellyfish.
Jellyfish? What's that?
We went to Antalya
last summer, remember?
There were those things in the sea...
...that we squeezed in our hand,
all gooey, remember?
They left our hands all sticky.
Oh yeah. I remember.
Like slime, they were...
Yes. Those were jellyfish.
Yuck! Disgusting. Just like Gorkem.
Gorkem? Who's Gorkem?
He is a stupid boy in our class.
Never leaves me alone.
Pulls my hair all the time.
What do you mean
he is in love with me, grandpa?
Why does he pull my hair
if he is in love with me?
Now, that's a tough one, sweety!
A tough one?
Difficult, I mean. A difficult question.
Maybe I'll understand when
I grow up, right, grandpa?
Maybe, honey...
What if I become like mum when I grow up?
What do you mean like mum?
You know, she is crazy.
What if I go nuts as well?
Where did you get that idea?
She's not crazy or anything...
I know, she is crazy.
My friends say so, too.
She takes lots of drugs all the time.
I'll be like mum, I know that.
I'll go crazy...
Ece, come on, my little one.
Don't say things like that.
Chase that away from your mind.
We'll go and have some pizza
right now, how about that?
Ece...
Come here.
Ece... My dear... Don't be scared.
You are going to be all right.
And your mum is not crazy.
She is a little unstrung these days,
but she'll get well soon.
- She'll get well? Really?
- Of course she will.
We'll go and have picnics together
like we used to.
You promise, grandpa?
I promise, sweety... I do.
Mum?
She took drugs. Psychiatric drugs.
In excessive amounts.
Excessive?
Too much Yilmaz, lots of them...
You mean she committed suicide, doctor?
She used to take those drugs regularly.
That doesn't prove she committed suicide.
But detective, she jumped from the window.
She was not pushed.
She just threw herself out of the window.
All the evidence indicates that.
Yes, it doesn't look like
she was pushed but...
...maybe someone
kind of prompted her to.
Because she was open to
this kind of inculcation.
A weak girl, she was, Sevgi.
What do you mean, detective?
Someone told your daughter
to jump down, and she jumped?
She did not decide to
commit suicide herself but...
...was persuaded to,
is that what you mean?
No one can resist the
fatal attraction of death, captain.
We all live to die one day,
are you not aware of that?
Have you never thought about
your own death?
I have, yes, many times,
but I've never longed for it.
Not everybody is
as successful as you are...
...in keeping their desires
under control, captain.
She really liked the dress
she was wearing when she died.
You will be cross with me but...
...this increases
the possibility of suicide too.
Some kind of a ritual.
Dying with her favorite dress on.
She used to wear it when
she would see her psychiatrist, too.
Could it be that she liked
her psychiatrist a lot, too?
What would you say, doctor?
Captain could be right
about it, detective.
We see that often in suicide cases.
A sort of preparation.
Little gestures blessing suicide.
It is not easy for
one to take one's own life.
It takes a lot of persuasion.
I guess no one would know a patient
better then one's psychiatrist.
Look doctor, you have to assure me
about my daughter.
I believe in science.
And I want to believe you.
I plan to run the rest of
my investigation accordingly...
...unless my daughter has committed
suicide because of your...
...nonsensical inculcation.
So, tell me the truth.
Your daughter was
definitely not suicidal!
And the drugs she was on, were all
supposed to heighten her spirits.
I am ready to conduct
any scientific research...
...you would like me to, to prove that.
I trust you, doctor.
And I trust you, captain.
I am not a captain.
I am just a detective.
I have nothing to do with titles.
- Ý see.
- Ý hope you do, doctor.
May Allah bless her soul. Poor
thing, she was such a nice person.
She was ill, but she was kind.
She never hurt anyone.
She was harsh to Ece sometimes,
but that's all.
Aren't we all like that? When I
think of all the times I beat Can...
Have you called Haluk?
Not yet dad. You told us not to.
Ok, you can tell him now
but tell him not to come.
Ok, dad, I'll tell him.
But dad, Haluk really loved our sister.
When he hears that
she has committed suicide...
Shut up, Nihat!
Don't use those words again!
Sevgi has not committed suicide.
I'll have nobody ever say that again.
You lied to me, grandpa.
You lied...
You told me mum was going to get better.
You told me we were going to
have picnics together.
Here, pick one.
Any of them should do the job.
Are they clean, Hayri?
Clean as a new born son of a bitch,
I'm telling you.
Is it for work or
have you been hired?
Hired?
I mean, have you become
a hired gun like me now?
I knew you would give in one day.
Nobody can resist the money
in this business.
Why did you quit, then?
You arrested me so many times,
I got sick of you.
I want this one, Hayri.
Good luck.
I knew a cop would need
my services one day.
But it makes me feel especially
proud that this cop...
...turns out to be Musa Rami.
You lied to me, grandpa.
You lied.
Detective...
Are you alright? You look pale.
I am alright, Bekir.
I'm alright, son. Thank you.
I'm on your side, detective.
I don't believe your daughter
Sevgi has committed suicide.
I believe she was killed.
I believe you.
It's so kind of you.
Someone has to stand up to them.
And we shall, Bekir.
Do not worry.
And we'll make ourself clear.
As you know,
killing is making yourself clear.
But it is theoretically impossible
to kill someone with a gun.
I know that one, detective,
you told me before.
A bullet, fired from a pistol always
halves the distance it travels.
I looked it up.
It is called Xenon Paradox.
But it's been invalidated.
- What do you mean?
There is a concept called
particle physics.
I mean, it can now be proven that
the bullet moves in the air.
I wouldn't be so sure.
You know, nothing in the universe
is what it looks like.
Once, we received a call saying
Servet Pembe...
I know that one, too, detective.
Servet Pembe turns out to be a man.
- How about the grave-diggers?
- What grave-diggers?
Never mind. Have a good day.
Don't miss the Friday prayers.
In the name of Allah.
I forced the Kazakh boy
to make a mistake, Mr. Musa.
You know Bobby Fischer?
The great chess master?
You know, once, he withdrew
from a tournament because...
...there was a lady competing.
Quite irritating, really.
He gets on my nerves.
The guy hates women.
He says he'd beat any woman
even without his knights.
But you know what happened to
Mr. Bobby-Arrogant-Fischer?
His record of the youngest
grandmaster was broken by...
...Judith Polgar, a woman.
Yes. And Kasparov used
to call her a "Circus Puppet".
But she defeated him
on the 42nd move.
And so I defeated the Kazakh guy.
But, I heard that people are
gossiping about my championship.
Not that I care about
all the hallway gossip but...
...they say the Kazakh boy could've
beaten me but he chose not to...
...because he loves me, bla bla bla.
I think maybe the kid was high...
...because he was shaking like
jelly while we played.
Really?
Actually, it's sad to see a chess
genius falter and fall like that.
On the other hand, if your victory
depends on that, then it hurts less.
Oh, whatever. I'm sorry I've been
talking about myself all the time...
...like a stupid career obsessive.
Why don't you tell me
how you've been since we last met?
Anything interesting?
That day, at the university,
after you'd left...
...all of a sudden
I started vomiting blood.
I went to see a doctor
who's a friend of mine.
And he told me I have brain tumor.
I have at most two months to live.
I am dying.
The same day,
my daughter Sevgi was killed.
My colleagues think
she has committed suicide but...
...I know she was murdered.
And because I am sure of that,
I am after those who killed her.
I cornered one of them but
I shot an innocent guy.
Many others got shot.
Kids and all...
That's life, Funda. One day
you are invited to a feast but...
...when you get there
you see your name on the menu.
I love her Haluk,
I love her so much.
It keeps growing in me.
But I just can't reach her.
I understand those who kill
themselves because of love, Haluk.
I understand them.
I love Funda so much, Haluk.
I love her so much.
Please calm down, Miss Funda.
He must have been joking.
What?
Mr. Musa must have been
teasing you.
But, this can't be true.
He told me everything.
He told me he'd shot the wrong guy.
He told me others had been shot
as well. It was in the news.
It said someone, a freak...
...had opened fire and
innocent people had been hurt.
You think Musa Rami is a freak?
I think... He is not.
He is a very kind man.
Then, he cannot have done
such a thing, right?
That's exactly why I am shocked.
Musa Rami likes playing
little games like that.
He'd convinced me once that
he was working for KGB.
It turned out
he worked for the Hungarians.
- Then he is not dying, right?
- Dying?
He told me he is dying and that
he has less than two months left.
Come on Miss Funda,
the detective has been teasing you.
Have a nice day, then.
- You too.
Keep on loving Musa Rami.
You too.
What is that for?
Here, let me show it before you ask.
But I was not speeding.
I didn't say you were.
Can you step out of
the vehicle please?
What is happening?
You remember me?
You were seeking an advisor
for your thesis.
Yes. I talked to you first.
And I sent you to Musa Rami.
I remember, yes.
I wish I hadn't.
You wish you hadn't done what?
I wish I hadn't sent you
on to Musa Rami.
I wish I had been your advisor.
I am happy to be working with
Musa Rami.
What is he telling you?
Nothing personal.
Nice things but nothing personal.
What could he have to tell you
that is personal?
What is with you?
Musa Rami is a fine man.
What do you want from him?
I don't want you to make a mistake.
I couldn't bear it.
Officer, could you please
tell me what it is that you want?
This is ridiculous.
What is this?
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?
Please think carefully.
No, nothing. I am tired of this,
I want to leave.
Detective... Can we talk?
Yes, Yilmaz.
I am listening to you, son.
Well, then, let me start.
I am going to die Yilmaz.
We are all going to die.
No, it's not the same.
I have a brain tumor.
Doctor Demir told me
I have two months left.
And that was more than
a month ago.
I haven't been able to tell my kids
yet, I don't know what to do.
You'd like some lemonade?
Why not?
Two, please.
Detective...
Yes Yilmaz,
I am listening to you, son.
Well, then, let me start.
Yilmaz... My daughter
did not commit suicide.
The Izmitlis murdered her.
- That's what you think, detective.
- Ýt is the very truth.
I killed Izmitli's son, and
his other son wants revenge.
It is that simple.
There is no other explanation.
And they won't stop yet, Yilmaz.
What can I do?
You'd like some lemonade?
Why not?
Yes, Yilmaz.
I am listening to you, son.
Well, then, let me start.
Yilmaz, I don't understand gays.
I'd say, if you are not gay,
you can't understand them.
- That's what you think, detective.
- Ýt is the very truth.
Just imagine two big guys in bed,
together, and naked, too.
How can I possibly understand
this without experiencing it?
You'd like some lemonade?
Yes?
I come home around
six o'clock in the evening.
You might want to include
that in your notes as well.
Your brother was also as confident
as you are, Tayfun Izmitli.
But he died.
And now it's your family's turn,
Musa Rami.
They are going to die, too.
No, nothing will
happen to my family.
I wouldn't be so sure.
You see the corn guy approaching?
No, you are looking
the wrong way.
When he lifts
the lid of the boiler...
...all your grandchildren
will be blown up.
You are bluffing.
You thought I was bluffing
about your daughter Sevgi too...
...but then she died.
- You are bluffing.
Your grandchildren are sweet,
Musa Rami.
I am sure they will
turn out to be the...
...most beautiful angels
in heaven. Especially Ece.
Come on.
Will you not get out of that car...
...and try to save your family?
He is about to open the boiler,
you old rake.
You are bluffing.
I can not possibly do
what you are asking me to, captain.
Are you disobeying
my orders Bekir?
You want me to arrest Musa Rami.
How could I do that?
We have lots of evidence
against him.
Come on, captain. What evidence?
What you call evidence is all fake.
We both know that.
To boot, no one knows, except
you and I and some other cops...
...that Musa Rami is
among the suspects.
He is innocent.
Even if he is not,
we can easily cover it up.
No one has been killed anyway!
People were shot, but by
divine decree, no one has died.
Do you want me
to cover up the truth?
No, captain. What I am saying
is there is no truth in sight.
Except your love for Funda...
What are you talking about?
You see Musa Rami as an opponent.
You are not concerned
about solving the case...
...you are only scheming
to get rid of Musa Rami.
Do you hear
what you are saying Bekir?
I do hear, captain, I'd rather be
deaf than hear what you are saying.
You give him up for a girl.
Shame on you!
Shut your mouth, Bekir!
What if I don't?
Are you going to make me?
Shut up, you jerk! Shut up!
I am sorry that you are
so scared of me, boys.
I am your mentor,
I won't kill you.
It's over Yilmaz. I quit.
I resign.
Are you quitting or
are you running away, detective?
Captain... Watch your language
when you speak to our mentor.
Will you teach me how to talk,
Bekir? Shut your damn mouth.
Whatever you say, captain,
but Musa Rami does not run away.
Yes, he does, too.
But not this time. I simply quit.
I'm tired. I want out.
At least, not until
some facts come to light.
You want to finish me
while I am on the job? So be it.
Butjudge it well.
Yes, I love Funda.
But I am innocent.
I have committed no crime.
Therefore be careful
what you accuse of.
I'll see you in the afterlife.
I love Funda
more than anyone does.
I hold his head down like this,
but he still struggles...
...the son of a bitch.
I say don't struggle, or...
...you will get it on the head,
you asshole. But he won't listen.
I had to hit him on the head
with the back of my gun.
Blood gushed out of his head.
Nihat.
Dad?
Yes, dad.
How is everybody, son?
As you'd expect them to be, dad.
They are all miserable.
How is Ece?
She is the same.
She misses her mum a lot.
Dad, have you been crying?
I'd promised Ece that
her mum would get well.
She thinks she will become insane
like her mum.
That she'll go insane and
kill herself.
That is what she keeps saying,
poor child.
I told her
we would go on a picnic.
Our sister, was she murdered dad?
I said "your mum would come too".
I promised.
Why don't we do anything dad?
What if they kill us all?
What if they kill you?
We'll all be ruined.
We will go on a picnic, Nihat.
What picnic, dad?
Talk to Derya and her husband.
Come and pick me up on Sunday.
WORLD IS STRANGE
WORLD DRAPERY
Musa Rami, the cop
in the escalator of death.
Now, this time,
you got your ass stuck...
...in a barrel of gunpowder,
Musa Rami. Boom!
I don't believe you. Really.
Your stupidity amazes me.
You killed my brother.
You are like a butcher
who cuts off his own arms and...
...puts them in display.
Your imbecility has by far
surpassed your mastery.
Pick one.
Pick one, you dirty old bag!
You can save one of your family.
We will kill the rest.
You get it, dumb sucker?
We will slaughter your family
one by one, in a row.
Kill me. Right now, right here.
Leave my kids alone.
They have nothing to do with this.
But you killed my brother...
...not me.
Now, we are not going to kill you...
...but those in the picture.
Now, pick one.
Whom should I not kill?
Go on.
Pick one.
Do it!
Haluk... Don't kill Haluk.
I pick my youngest son, Haluk.
Good.
Now you can leave and
start funeral preparations.
You will have seven people
to bury in a week.
We are running out of time.
We have to move the girls and
the kids away from here.
Bastards! Dad.
Why don't we ask for protection?
We could ask our police friends.
No, son, it won't work.
There are things you don't know.
We have to move the kids out
of town. There is no other way.
Let's take them to Mardin,
to my folks.
They will be safe there
in the village, with my father.
I'll take care of this.
I'll take them with the van.
We will take a couple of days and
wander so they can't locate us.
Does anybody know that
we are here?
Yes. Haluk knows.
He will be here shortly.
Haluk? He'll be here shortly?
What's he got to do in Istanbul?
He just suddenly came last night.
But, didn't you tell him not
to come? He'd be safe in London.
We told him dad. He senses that
there is something wrong here.
He wants to be with you.
He won't listen to us.
What do you mean he won't listen?
Son! Haluk... My dear son!
You told me to come in
two months, but I couldn't wait.
That's good, son.
Come on, boys.
We'll do as we planned.
Now, go make your preparations.
Dündar, you set out at once and...
...don't you come back,
whatever happens!
Nihat, you wait for my call.
Where are they going, dad?
I'd rather you don't know.
How are you dad? Are you well?
When a father buries his child,
when destiny backfires like a gun...
...when a man past sixty ends up with
a beauty named Funda in his hands.
I don't know what to say dad.
When you called the other day...
...it broke my heart to hear
the tone of your voice.
I had to come and see you.
My dear son. Don't tell anyone,
not even your sisters...
...not even your girlfriend,
but you are like no other to me.
You are the one person on earth
that I love most.
And Allah willing,
you'll be spared, Haluk.
You are like a butcher
who cuts off his own arms and...
...puts them on display.
You're talking to me?
Pardon me?
You're talking to me?
Pardon me?
You're talking to me?
No, son. I didn't say anything.
You're talking to me?
No, I am not going out tonight.
I have to study.
I'll look into
the Sicilian Defense.
Oh, come on, you should
know these things...
...it's a certain
defense pattern in chess.
There is a tournament
in Strasbourg next month.
Yes, there is a prize.
I don't know yet.
Yes, I am excited.
But I'll win.
I feel like I can beat anyone
since I defeated the Kazakh boy.
No, I am not being big-headed.
This is not the first time
I defeated someone.
But I'll tell you something,
once you win, it gets easier...
...to win the next time.
You can never tell, though.
Nothing is
what it looks like to be.
I'd told you
Musa Rami's stories, hadn't I?
Yes. It turns out Servet Pembe
was a man. I could not believe it.
I was so embarrassed.
They say he is always like that,
kidding around.
He's really kind, yes.
He knows everything.
At times I even suspect that
he reads my mind.
I am not being ridiculous, if you
knew him, you would understand.
I am now cooking up
a tough question for him.
You know they fire in the air
sometimes in games and stuff, right.
I'll ask him how high the bullet
rises and where and when it lands?
No, no, he won't lie.
If he doesn't know the answer,
he'll say so.
But if that's the case,
I have a nice reply.
Whatever,
tell us about your gown.
Musa Rami.
Detective, I hate doing this but...
This is one of the worst moments
in my life but I have to arrest you.
Are you sure, Yilmaz?
And what are you accusing me of?
Causing people to get injured
in the mall while...
...attempting to shoot Tayfun Izmitli.
But you are making a mistake.
I did no such thing.
You did.
Don't lie to me.
Huseyin.
Excuse me, detective.
Why did you do that, detective?
Why wouldn't you listen to me?
I didn't do anything, Yilmaz.
Don't fool yourself.
You don't know Funda,
she's not that type of girl.
She will ignore you.
You're arresting me for no reason.
Pray, detective,
you are humiliating yourself.
I arrest you for the
slaughter in front of the mall.
Don't call that a slaughter.
Nobody died.
Yilmaz!
Leave Musa Rami alone.
Leave him alone. You can't
make him pay for your incompetence.
Stop it. It's over.
You couldn't get the girl.
Bekir! You are dead.
You are a history now.
What are you going to do? Kill me?
Boys, that's enough.
Don't be stupid.
What do you think you are doing?
What did you do Bekir?
Why did you come here?
I wanted to save you.
I think you deserve this.
You are a great man.
I believe you are innocent.
But I am not, Bekir.
I did the mall shooting.
I knew it, Musa Rami.
I knew you were guilty.
But I am not, Yilmaz.
I didn't do anything.
So, you want me to take care of
Tayfun Izmitli? Ý don't believe you!
You won't do it?
Oh, I will. Just show us the money
and don't worry about the rest.
All these years
you were after me...
...you kept pestering me all the time...
...you put me in
jail time and again and...
...now we'll do business together.
Anything else?
Maybe one day we'll write
ourjoint memories partner.
Come on, Hayri. Don't exaggerate.
Here, I got all the
information you'll need.
Here is where he'll be
in the next four hours.
Finish him within the next four hours.
You are a great employer, Musa Rami.
Get rid of that dirt bag for me, Hayri.
Consider it done, Musa Rami.
Hello, Dündar? How are you, son?
Are you there yet?
Nearly, huh?
Where exactly are you?
Okay. Be careful.
Now, don't wander too much.
And call me in the morning.
Alright? Ok, then.
Get rid of that dirt bag for me, Hayri.
Consider it done, Musa Rami.
Allah damn you!
Allah damn you! Allah damn you!
Allah damn you!
Yes?
Hi, Funda.
Thank you.
You got 85? Ý'm glad to hear that.
Not at all, it's your own achievement.
Pardon me? Your graduation ball?
I'll be more than happy to come.
If I can. Where is it? Okay.
I'll try and make it. Thank you.
Good night.
Sir? Ý think you've got
the wrong address.
The elders meeting is not here.
I have to go in.
You have an invitation?
I am invited.
It's a graduation party.
Old man, it looks like
you graduated a long time ago.
I suggest you go back to your bed
in the nursing home and sleep tight.
Maybe you'll see this place
in your dreams.
Mr. Musa!
Hello.
Looks like fighting is an
occupational hazard of yours.
I wish it was the only problem
I have, Funda.
- Ý am sorry, what a faux pas.
- Never mind.
Would you like a drink?
Anything.
You don't seem to like drinking much.
I don't like drinking when I am sober.
That's why I can't get drunk.
I was very happy to hear
you got 85 for your thesis.
Yes, thanks to you.
That is the reason
I invited you here, to thank you.
How nice of you to think
of that, you are honoring me.
You are an extraordinary man, Mr. Musa.
If I were a sculptor, I would
make a massive statue of you.
I guess you'd need a lot of clay.
I lost another one of my children, Funda.
What? Ýs this anotherjoke?
No. I wish it were, but it is not.
Haluk died. Really.
I am so sorry.
So am I. I can not handle it anymore.
I lost the track of things.
I'm getting old, I guess.
And that huge thing in my head.
I think it's growing larger by the hour.
It is huge. Like your eyes Funda.
You have such lovely eyes. They are huge.
If shot with a 45 degree angle,
it lands in about 57 seconds.
Depending on the wind,
it may travel up to 300 metres.
But don't try testing it.
Just ask me and I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything, Funda.
Funda!
Yes, Leyla?
Come on. You promised.
They want me to sing.
Really?
Yes. That's my talent.
Since I was a child
they make me sing on every occasion.
Then, why don't you sing?
Really?
I'd love to listen.
But I'd feel embarrassed.
Please sing. Please.
I would like to sing this song
for my dear friend, Musa Rami.
I love you.
Will you marry me?
- What?
Marry me, Funda. I love you. Marry me.
Mr. Musa, are you crazy?
Do you realize what you are saying?
It was so decreed.
What do you mean?
Son, your father has brain tumor.
You mean... Dad is going to die?
Yes.
Let's go.
Alright. We will keep him
under watch here.
Maybe you can stop by later
to say goodbye.
He proposed to me.
What?
Musa Rami was in love with
Miss Funda, Nihat.
You whore.
What?
You are a whore!
You killed my father.
- Nihat, don't.
- Fuck off!
Aren't you ashamed of having
proposed to a girl younger than me?
I am not.
But I am ashamed of you!
The Izmitlis will
kill you too, Nihat.
What do you mean?
I made a deal with them.
I could save only one of you.
But I didn't choose you.
And who did you choose?
I can't say that.
But it was not you.
Why dad?
Don't you love me?
Of course I love you, Nihat.
You are my eldest son.
Thank you, dad. Now, dad,
we have to stop these motherfuckers.
I tried. It won't work.
Then we use force.
That doesn't work either.
Let's go to the police.
There has to be a way out of this.
Let's do something.
I am the one
who did the mall shooting.
They'll put me in jail if I talk.
We can't go to the police,
they won't be any help.
It's alright, dad. If they put you
in jail, I'll fight outside.
You are going to die
in a week anyway.
I didn't mean that.
Dad.
Don't die, dad.
You are a great man.
You shouldn't die.
Please, don't die.
What am I going to do without you?
Please, don't die.
Please don't on me.
Let me take these back.
You stay here, and don't you die!
37 deaths occurred in
traffic accidents countrywide.
In the abominable accident
that took place near Nizip...
...city of Gaziantep...
...six members of the
same family were killed.
In the accident that
took place around 23:00...
...a van with the plate number
34 OU 5746, tipped over.
The names of the people who died
in the accident are as follows:
The driver Dündar Dünya...
...his wife Derya Rami Dünya,
their children Can Dünya...
...Perihan Rami, Didem Rami and
Ece Bilgen.
No eye witnesses
have reported to the police.
The police investigation continues.
When the sun is folded up,
When the stars fall, losing their lustre,
When the mountains vanish,
When the she-camels, ten months
with young, are left untended,
When the wild beasts are herded together,
When the oceans boil over with a swell,
When the souls are sorted,
When the female infant
buried alive is questioned,
For what crime she was killed,
When the scrolls are laid open,
When the world on High is unveiled,
When the Blazing Fire is kindled
to fierce heat;
And when the Garden is brought near,
Every soul will know what it has done;
So verily I call to witness the
planets that recede,
Go straight, or hide;
And the Night as it dissipates;
And by the morning as it brightens,
Verily this is the word of a most
honourable Messenger,
Endued with Power, respected
before the Lord of the Throne,
Endued with Power, with rank before
the Lord of the Throne,
With authority there, and
faithful to his trust.
O' people! Your companion is not one
possessed;
And without doubt he saw him
in the clear horizon.
Neither doth he withhold grudgingly
a knowledge of the Unseen.
Nor is it the word of an evil spirit
accursed.
Then whither go ye?
Verily this is no less than a
Message to all the Worlds:
To whoever among you wills
to go straight:
But ye shall not will except as God
wills, the Cherisher of the Worlds.
Nihat, my son.
Forget the hospital. Now, listen.
We shall take our revenge
on the Izmitlis.
Are you ready for that, son?
We will finish them all.
Okay. We'll meet
tomorrow morning at 9:30.
Yes, there. Don't you come to my
place, or you'll be noticed at once.
Prepare as many bombs
as you can...
...take all the guns that
you can find, and pray.
Allah is with us son.
Of course I do love you son,
you are my eldest son.
Go ahead.
Thank you for not
turning me down, Funda.
You are welcome, Mr. Musa.
But should you not be
in the hospital.
Why should I spend my
last few days in the hospital?
Instead of being here with you?
Please, Mr. Musa,
don't say such things.
But why Funda? Ý love you.
Please don't leave.
You are scared of me, aren't you?
You are scared of me.
Up until the last few months,
everybody used to like me.
Allah knows, I liked them too.
And I loved you and Haluk the most.
Then my children
died one by one.
And my grandchildren...
Everybody around me keeps dying.
Now whenever someone talks about
love, my hand flies to my gun.
You don't need to be
scared of me, Funda.
I know, you find me harsh but...
...if I lean to violence,
grief is the cause.
Before I die, could I ask you
to do me a favour?
A tiny wish.
Alright. I'll do it.
Thank you.
Will you please say
you love me just once?
Say you love me.
Say you love me!
- Ý love you.
- You are lying!
Dedicated to my mother and Kitano...
