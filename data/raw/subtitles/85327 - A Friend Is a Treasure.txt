I don't care whether
you believe it or not
but this map will lead
you to a hidden treasure
in the Pacific Ocean.
[Man] I know, on the
island of Bungo Bungo.
On the island of Bungo Bungo.
[Man] It's not even on a map.
Neither was Australia once.
If your boat was
read then find it.
[Man] It's ready, all
I need is another 2,000
for the last installment.
Yeah, the plain ol' horses.
Me?
Never.
(laughs) They know
you better than I do.
Look kid, I caught six
tropical diseases guarding
that treasure, I'm
telling you it's there.
Here's your 2,000 but I want it.
No sweat, Uncle Brady.
I'll set sail first
thing tomorrow morning.
Yeah.
At the crack of dawn.
There's a treasure
there kid, like (mumbles).
It's sitting there,
waiting for ya.
Yeah, yeah.
(upbeat tropical music)
Hello, Alan.
Hi.
You want another drink?
No thanks, I'm broke.
The wheels of luck
aren't getting you, huh?
I'm afraid so.
I mean, I just
dropped 2,000 dollars.
Couldn't care less except
that, it wasn't my money.
You interested in
a little tip from me?
A fixed race, get some money
and put it all on Big Phil.
Borrow, do anything, if you
put all your money on Big Phil,
you'll make a fortune.
Big Phil?
Chocolate's the
favorite, he's gonna win.
Alan, they're
hoods from Chicago,
they don't fool around.
They'll beat up the jockey.
They've got their
money on Big Phil.
On Big Phil.
Yeah, thanks Linda.
What for?
I didn't tell you anything.
That's right.
[Man] Man in Chicago
surely thinks Chocolate
is gonna break a leg, huh?
Yeah, they put a whole
pile of bread on Big Phil.
Instead we got 30,000
simoleons on Chocolate.
Wait, you know what?
What?
Another 15 grand on Chocolate.
But they said he
ain't gonna win, Frisk.
I say the winner's Chocolate.
You can take care of
Big Phil's jockey.
What do those idiot's
know in Chicago?
I'm with you Frisco.
I don't like taking orders
from guys that don't know.
How are the girls
gonna get to the jockey?
Follow them.
Hey, hey.
Hi.
What are you
doing here, Grubby?
Still betting your money on
horses that come in last?
No, I'm with a bookie
now, I learned my lesson.
You betting on Chocolate?
Naturally, he's a sure thing.
15,000 bucks, that
makes 30 grand.
So long.
Hold on.
Chocolate's up for the money
but I know a guy
who's paying double.
So if you place
your bet with him,
we can split the difference.
You're boss will never know.
Okay, let's go.
Well wait a minute.
I've got to handle this alone.
This bookie wants it on the QT.
You can trust me, right?
Sure, unless you prefer
to die with head bashed in,
huh metal head?
Careful.
Deliver the money to the table.
[Horse Race Announcer]
Nice breakaway.
El Figor takes the lead
followed by Calamity Jane,
Ravatin, Chocolate and Big Phil.
Can you imagine
that, giving us double?
Two to one on Chocolate.
Yeah, okay.
Fantastic.
Okay, here's to our benefactor.
A toast to Chocolate.
[Horse Race Announcer] As
they come into the last stretch.
Come on boy.
Where's Big Phil?
I put a lot of money on him.
Well Big Phil is back there.
He's the last one.
Come on, get with it
Chocolate, come on.
Come on!
[Announcer] Winner,
fourth race, Chocolate.
There he is, go get him.
Move it.
(tropical music)
Uncle Brady, open.
Hey Brady.
Uncle Brady, come here.
Come on, wake up.
Good news.
Oh it's you.
I'm ready to move out
but you gotta finance me.
50,000.
And of course, you're mad
but I'll pay you back,
what's a matter?
Don't you trust me?
Trust you?
[Alan] Exactly.
I don't trust anybody.
Least of all, you.
Don't come back
without any money.
Uncle Brady, wake up.
Everything's set, you
can't pull out now, right?
Yeah.
Hi.
What did you do with
the 15,000 dollars?
The what?
What are you
deaf or something?
The 15,000 dollars.
15,000.
What do you want?
Who are you?
Don't play games
with us, buddy.
Now I get it,
you think I'm Alan.
No, I'm Johnny,
his twin brother.
Oh really?
Really, this
happens all the time.
It's a cross I have to bear.
Don't worry, we'll
just put your little name
on your brother's tomb.
(crashing)
(groaning)
No wait a minute,
no wait, no wait.
(groaning)
Listen boy, this don't
look too good for you.
Take this here and go.
I already had breakfast.
No, the map's inside.
Take it and get the
hell out of here.
Gee, there's a lot of water.
I need a boat.
You need a boat?
I was only kidding.
I've got a great boat.
Don't lose the map.
Don't worry.
There really is a treasure.
(yelling)
Come on, keep
your eyes on him.
You see him, you see him?
No.
(horse galloping)
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honor
and privilege to present to
you, Mr. Charlie O'Brien.
(clapping)
Get out of the way.
Do you think you can
make it around the world?
Well of course I can,
thanks to delicious,
homemade marmalade
by Puffin Brothers.
Not to mention the
20,000 dollars prize money
they'll pay you if you make it.
There's a lot energy and
vigor in Puffin marmalade
but you mean, they
don't pay you?
Charlie O'Brien,
you're something else.
Seriously though, how do you
feel about sailing around
the earth all by yourself?
What do you think you'll
miss most after days
and days out at sea
without ever sighting land.
With a bottle Puffys
sister, I can circumnavigate
the whole wide world.
Well you won't really be
sailing all this time alone.
Ladies and gentlemen, a
beautiful parrot, Paquito,
will be going along too.
Does Paquito enjoy
Puffin's Marmalade also?
Why you asking
the little critter?
Paquito do you also
enjoy Puffin's Marmalade?
Marmalade man, marmalade man.
(laughing)
(yelling)
Go Charlie, happy sailing.
(upbeat music)
(tropical music)
(parrot cawing)
Marmalade men, marmalade men.
Jam overboard.
Marmalade overboard.
Puffin overboard.
[Paquito] Marmalade men.
Shut up or I'll jam this
marmalade, you know where.
Another two minutes
and they're done.
Don't you stretch your neck
on my beams, you understand?
(parrot cawing)
Huh, they're finished?
How is it possible?
You parrot or a
winged rhinoceros.
Hey buddy, look me in the
eye when I talk to you.
Marmalade mate.
Your going in this frying pan.
I'll pluck every
feather in your body.
You'll be a bald parrot.
(snoring)
Waba, waba.
Waba don't allow
no bean stealer.
Paquito's a liar, there
isn't a brick for you.
(parrot crying)
(mumbling)
[Man In Helicopter] Hey
Charlie, Charlie come on out.
(helicopter whirring)
How you doing, boy?
How's it going you old buffalo?
I saw you knock your
sponsor overboard, huh?
Hey Charlie, when you gonna
quite saying solitary?
[Charlie] When I
get a bigger boat.
There's never enough room.
[Man In Helicopter] There
never will be with you,
old boy. (Laughs)
Need anything, Charlie?
No just come around and
pay me a visit if you can.
[Man In Helicopter]
Okay Charlie.
How's your radio?
Everything's ship shape.
Loud and clear all around.
[Man In Helicopter] Okay,
over and out, sea bird.
Roger.
Well then Paquito,
the thief ain't you.
There's a, some bean
eating thief here.
Alright, where are you?
Parasitical skunk, I'll
make you eat your own liver.
Where the hell are you?
Come on out, let's go.
Your punishment is
gonna be commensurate
with the time you
keep yourself hidden.
(tropical music)
Go on, hide you sewer rat.
I'll find you sooner or later.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, Paquito, this
steak's big enough
to choke a draft horse.
Looks more like a shank
of hippopotamus to me.
Let's slap down over
here for a little air.
A perfidious thief
might be attracted
by a mammoth overgrown
beef steak, right?
[Paquito] Right.
Good bird.
Okay, now I'll fake being
distracted and play the radio.
[Paquito] Up yours.
Yeah up yours too.
Here we go.
Hallelujah.
Sailing Puffin to Coast Guard.
Puffin to Coast Guard, over.
[Man On Radio] Coast Guard
to Puffin, what's up Charlie,
over.
Ain't nothing in
particular, just calling
to say that I'm hooked
and know that is
the bait that's found it's mate.
[Man On Radio] We
don't dig you Charlie,
you say the bait
has found it's mate?
Yeah more or less.
[Man On Radio]
We're not authorized
to take coded messages
from private sailing.
Sorry, you'll have to (mumbles).
It's already clear to deck
and the fish is jumping,
roger, over and out.
Okay parasite.
(crashing)
Yeah, here we go.
Well, a stowaway, huh?
Hi.
The name's Alan.
No, no, look.
There's a reason for everything.
And I came here to tell
you how it happened.
Get down.
I as running away
from these hoods,
they were out for blood.
So am I.
They thought I
was somebody else.
Yeah.
And your boat
was my last chance.
The only place to hide.
Miserable.
Wait, I listen, if you like,
I can pay my way.
Pay your way?
A boot in the pants.
No, can't we talk this over.
(laughs)
Careful, it's cold.
Hey wait, get me out.
It's criminal, you
can't leave me here.
Oh yeah, well I
couldn't care less
and nobody's gonna
bother anyhow.
(laughs)
Criminal!
You'll be sorry.
This guy's death is gonna
be on your conscience.
Forever.
Oh no.
Hey, company, three o'clock.
Huh?
[Charlie] That's even
more criminal than me.
Holy.
(tropical music)
You on?
Yeah.
Almost as big as
you are, Captain.
[Man On Radio] You're
authorized to drop him
off on Rabbit Island, Charlie.
Okay, roger out.
That's it.
I'll put you there with the
other rabbit's and fly away.
I hope you know, you're
gonna have to give me bread
and water supply, for
30 days, that's rough.
You'll have to do without.
Here.
Here.
That's hard.
We're under regulations.
If I wanted to, I could've
dumped you overboard
like rotten fish.
No look, I feel,
I didn't get dumped.
Besides, you saved me.
Which attenuates the blame.
Instead of a stowaway, I'm
the one who was shipwrecked.
It's that simple.
Okay, stowaway or shipwrecked
makes no difference.
Gotta clean the
galley, the decks,
the dolehouse, the brass
and keep the ship on course
and check the sails.
Navigating is not allowed.
I mean, a stowaway
can't navigate.
Right, but you're shipwrecked,
get your ass over here
and start cleaning.
Snap to it, sailor.
The blanket is mine, I'm
getting some shut eye.
Aye, aye, sir.
Do we stay on this course?
Yeah.
And wake me up at five.
(mumbles)
Only if you should sight
a flying whale. (Snores)
Yes sir.
(snoring)
(upbeat music)
O'Brien, I'm sailor Puffin.
Atmosphere condition
don't coincide
with latest weather bulletin.
Puffin to California two,
come in please, over.
Come in California
two, over. (Knocks)
California two, califor,
what are you.
The clouds are
better than the radio.
I mean, it looks like a storm.
I'll decide who's to
look at the clouds or not.
You just do as I tell you.
Come in California, California
two to Puffin, come in.
(sighs)
Something wrong, Captain?
No, it's just that
the radio doesn't work
and suddenly we have trees
sprouting in the ocean.
Nah, looks like a wave to me.
Get me the binoculars.
The what?
The binoculars.
Oh like field glasses?
Uh huh.
The...
Here you go, catch.
(splashing)
You lost your
binoculars, Captain.
I lost 'em, yeah.
A pair of binoculars
ain't required to tell me
that that there is an island.
It just might be a mirage.
What mirage?
You see it too.
It's an island with trees on it.
Oh yeah, I can see it now.
It's an island.
Hey, you sure can see
without binoculars, Captain.
The only trouble
is, it ain't booked.
There's only water.
In a radius of over 200
miles, ain't one island.
You know what, maybe
the wind's were favorable
and that is Rabbit Island.
Yeah, alright, shut up.
Course is right.
Yet there's land there
when it says here
there shouldn't be land.
So it's either the compass
or me that's crazy.
But if it's what I think it is,
stowaway, you better
start praying.
Can I be fixed?
Oh no.
Huh, that's not
good for the compass.
How many prayers do you know?
Well there's
the Lord's prayer,
the hail Mary,
act of contrition.
No, don't do something
you may regret.
First I know.
I was shipwrecked.
We'll see if I regret it.
Come back here.
Listen Captain,
let's talk this over.
I have something
important to tell you.
It could change your life.
Captain change your life.
(groaning)
Now wait, I'm serious.
What's ducking huh?
A shipwrecked person
must be turned over
to the authorities.
I'm turning you
over to the sharks.
Shipwreck or stowaway makes
no difference to them.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
(yells)
My boat.
That's it Captain,
you can make it.
You're almost there, keep going.
Forget it Captain, that's life.
Thanks a lot.
Our only chance is
that island, follow me.
(groaning)
(parrot cawing)
(upbeat music)
(birds cawing)
(groaning)
Charlie, I mean
Captain, I'm sorry.
Captain.
I've gotta tell you
the truth about why
I ended up on your boat.
Come closer?
Okay.
As I was saying.
Closer, yeah?
Okay.
Hold on.
I'm sorry about the compass.
I goosed it, you're right.
And it's my fault
if we ended up here.
But I had a real good reason.
See this island?
It's deserted.
And you can't find
it on any map.
Understand?
I sure do, you weasel.
Hold it.
Come here.
Relax.
Relax?
I lost a boat in
a contract I had
with the marmalade company,
only to end up on a deserted
island with a sneaky side
of a side wind up.
Easy, easy.
No not the coconut, you
wouldn't use it anyway.
You're too nice a guy.
There ain't nobody around here
with loathing and
pure hatred than me.
Miserable parasite.
Hey cool it.
You left the steer in gear.
That's why you lost your boat.
I should of let shark in.
Now how will we
get back once we find
the treasure, huh?
Treasure?
How'd you know?
A hidden treasure.
And it's worth
millions of dollars.
On this island.
You mean it's true?
Look, I'll prove it.
This here is my uncle's map.
He's got meningitis
and the French curse,
otherwise he'd be here himself.
And I'm supposed to believe
in a treasure map drawn
by your uncle who's got
the curse and meningitis?
No, calm down,
Charlie, I mean, Captain.
Okay, okay, I'm calm.
Calm down, let's get our wits.
We've been cast
on a desert island
and if I don't kill
you, it's only because
I might have to do
it later for food.
Now I'll go here
and you go there
and if this island
ain't no fairy tale,
we'll meet up on the other side.
Otherwise, we'll
never meet again
which is my fondest hope.
I got it.
You miserable
coniving galleywag.
(tropical music)
(yelling and buzzing)
Get out of here.
(shooting)
Where'd he find that gun?
(birds chirping)
(shooting)
He found a gun.
Hey Captain, are you crazy?
(shooting)
You sneaky, you were out
to kill me, weren't you?
You're the one who
started shooting.
Where'd you find that gun?
I don't have a gun.
Don't have a gun.
There's only two of
us on the island.
Alright, where's that gun?
Don't you understand.
There's somebody
else who's looking
for the treasure.
(shooting)
They're onto you, Charlie.
They're not aiming at me.
We better get out of here.
Uh huh, the shots
come from the west
so we go east.
Hey, that's south, not east.
You're looking
at it upside down.
Charlie.
Hey Charlie.
Shouldn't we stick
together from now on?
As much as the
idea is obnoxious,
I'm afraid it makes
pretty good sense.
Yeah, okay, let's
move out of here.
Hey, I'm giving the orders.
Give the orders.
Let's move out of here.
To the east?
Yeah.
If somebody's shooting at us,
it means the treasure's
here, Charlie.
Old Brady was right.
Who'd you say old Brady was?
My uncle.
Oh great, it
runs in the family.
Look, I'm sorry
about the boat.
And my parrot.
And your parrot.
And the marmalade contract.
Yeah.
But I've got
Brady's map and that's
the answer to our
troubles, Charlie.
You're getting on my nerves.
Stick with me Charlie boy,
I'll lead you to a
treasure that'll make
you go down in history.
(yelling)
Charlie?
Charlie?
Hey Charlie, where are you?
Shut up will you?
Telling me I'll go
down in history.
Well how did you
get down there?
(mumbles) Wasn't an idiot.
I'd like to know why
anybody would build
an underground deep hole in
the middle of the jungle.
To hide the treasure.
Oh yeah, well your uncle
Brady forgot his helmet.
And yet, you know,
according to Brady's map,
this might be the place.
Uh huh, this is military.
US Army came through here.
Lookie here.
Uniforms, equipment,
miskits, cigarettes.
(laughs) Without filters.
Hey, this outta be good.
[Charlie] What outta be good?
Well, this says,
only Puffin can give
you energy, strength and health.
Want some?
Chuck it out.
Why?
Move that outta here.
Oh, I forgot, sorry.
Let's take a look
down there and see where
it leads to.
Are you still going east?
Shut up.
Looks like a door.
A door.
Me first?
Yeah.
Okay.
(birds chirping)
Hey Charlie.
Huh?
We got visitors.
They American?
Uh, Aliens.
Requires diplomacy.
(yelling)
(speaking foreign language)
Hi.
(yelling)
(mumbles)
To me they look like
a bunch of jubonies.
Hey.
Come on.
(speaking foreign language)
What's that he said?
Either he talks or you talk.
(speaking foreign language)
Invadoors?
I don't understand why
you pick out one word.
No speak, you no
speak, I speak, silence.
You two invader, invader.
Oh, we're invaders.
Oh.
But who is he?
Anulu, skit Mama.
Oh us two have a mama.
No Anulu's not Mama,
Mama's the queen.
Queen of island, Bongo Bongo.
Your prisoner, come out.
Come out prisoner.
Oh he's saying
we're his prisoners.
Yeah, okay, we're prisoners.
(yelling)
They coming, they
coming, they coming.
(yelling)
(bong ringing)
(drumming)
(yelling)
(speaking foreign language)
Oh he's like his poor
father, he's war-like.
He like war.
But you look friendly.
You're my guest.
And my daughter's guest.
(laughs)
Yeah.
Your highness, madam,
I imagine you're the queen.
Oh what do you
know, you imagine.
Yes and my name is Mama.
You're American.
How you reach Bongo Bongo?
Oh well that's a long story.
The captain went off
course and perhaps
I better not bring
the matter up.
We almost got a bullet
in the head as soon
as we set foot on the island.
We don't shoot.
We got no guns.
We peaceful people.
Unless.
Unless what?
Kamasuka, the
Japanese soldier.
American and Japanese fight war.
Then one day, all Americans go
but one Japanese
still fight war.
He lives in fort.
And no one ever bothered
to tell him the war was over?
He don't believe it.
But he don't bother us,
we don't bother him.
Where you going?
What are you doing?
May I ask you a
personal question
just out of
scientific curiosity?
Tell me boy.
Could you tell me if
there's been any talk
about hidden treasure
on this island?
No treasure on Bongo Bongo.
Nothing hidden here.
Satisfied knucklehead?
There ain't no hidden treasure.
So let's knock it off.
This is our
treasure, Bongo Bongo.
Full of happiness, joy and love.
(groaning)
(speaking foreign language)
I'm very sorry but
witch doctor war-like too.
I nothing can do.
Ancient tribal custom.
Tribe only excepts stranger
if they win test of strength.
Well who is we
supposed to beat?
Fight chief of tribe.
I would never do that.
Go and test my strength
against you, Queen Mama.
Not me, him.
(speaking foreign language)
(upbeat tribal drum music)
(laughs and claps)
(singing)
May I have a word, please?
He says that, the fat man
there, that you couldn't beat
your way out of a grapefruit.
Him.
(yells)
He's saying he'd like
to take you on first.
Uh huh.
(groaning)
(laughs)
(singing)
(screaming)
(clapping and laughing)
(yelling)
What's going on?
Bad men, pirates from Barcuda.
They make slave
labor of our people.
They come and steal
boys and girls.
They'd steal two
beggars like you two.
Go, quick, quick, run.
Save yourself.
[Pirate] Okay, remember
boys, only beautiful chicks
and macho men.
[Pirate] I'll choose the men.
[Pirate] I don't want no
rejects this time, understand?
[Pirate] I'm
choosing the girls.
[Pirate] Who's
choosing the girls?
[Pirate] I'm
choosing the girls.
[Pirate] He's
choosing the girls.
(yelling)
Where'd they gone, huh?
They're here.
Where they gone, idiot?
How come there ain't
a chick in sight?
You got a point there, huh?
Take a look in the huts.
Okay, get on with it.
Onto the women.
Shame on you.
Get the witch
doctor (mumbles).
(yelling)
Okay, dog, let me
hear you repeat that.
Oh yeah?
(groaning)
What's that groove
you got playing there?
(upbeat music)
(mumbling)
(groaning)
This is our gig.
I'm gonna have to tell
these sods, zackatom.
Zackatom.
Hey, try with both.
Zackatom.
Zackatom.
(groaning)
Let me help you,
I'll show you.
With both feet, zackatom.
(groaning)
(groaning)
(upbeat rock music)
(groaning)
Zackatom, zackatom,
zackatom, zackatom. (Laughs)
I'm gonna tell Mama you
break, sword got no point.
(laughs)
Okay jellyfish.
(groaning)
Zackatom, to you.
(cries)
(crashing)
(cheering)
Hey boss.
Don't touch me.
It's me, it's me.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
(yelling at once)
Come on hurry.
We come back next
time, we'll show you.
(yelling)
(talking at once)
[Alan] This could be the spot.
[Charlie] So could
the whole island.
We've covered it six
times in two days.
Don't you know when to quit?
[Alan] Listen Charlie,
according to Uncle Brady's map,
the treasure should be
somewhere along the line drawn
from shore to shore,
indicating a spot
with 11 coconut palms
and two midget palms.
[Charlie] So what do we do?
Draw up a map of
palm tree clusters?
[Alan] Why not?
There aren't that many.
[Charlie] 11 palms,
you gotta be kidding.
The only thing we
can do with 11 palms
is make a raft and
clear out of here.
[Alan] You know what
you're trouble is?
You've got no faith.
Oh sure.
Maybe we'll run into a
sign that says there's
a treasure here.
Why not?
It could happen.
(thundering)
Doesn't seem like the
rain is gonna let up.
Don't you think we
outta take a break?
Take advantage you mean.
The rain makes digging easier.
You gotta have faith.
Right, Anulu?
Good job, fast, shove, shove.
Shut up.
Shut up, shut up.
(thundering)
Hey, I found it.
I found it.
Look, look, I found it.
I found it.
You found a tombstone
that sank in the mud.
See what it says.
Oh it's voodoo, voodoo.
[Charlie] Cut that out, Anulu.
Here lies Jonathan
Foster who searched
for treasure with Brian
Culpepper and died,
March 16th 1950.
You see what happens to you
when you search for treasure
that doesn't exist?
Yeah but, this proves
there are other people
who believe the treasure exits.
Just because Foster died,
that doesn't mean
Culpepper died too.
(laughs)
Hm, Brian Culpepper,
died March 17th, 1950.
He went the very next day.
Anulu.
Catch.
You know what?
I prefer the rain.
When it rains,
it's too wet for you.
When the sun shines,
it's too hot for you.
Come on Charlie.
It's not that easy to
find a buried treasure.
Yeah, dumb suckers
like you though
are pretty easy to find.
Keep digging.
We're close, I can feel it.
Have faith.
(shooting)
Get down Anulu.
[Charlie] He ain't
shooting at him.
I told you not to go
by the fort, Captain.
Japanese no like, he shoot.
How much ammo does he have?
Oh, very much ammo.
Japanese ammo.
We're in trouble.
[Anulu] Boom, boom.
Get down boy, he might
just take a pot shot at you.
Anulu know, Anulu know.
According to my
uncle's map here,
you know where the treasure is?
It's right under the
fort with Kamikaze.
His name is Kamasuka.
Anyway, I'm not interested.
It's all yours.
You mean you're quitting?
Now that we're so close?
I thought you were made
of better stuff, Charlie.
Yeah, I ain't
particularly fond
of a bullet in the head.
Poor guy still thinks
the war is going on.
I'm not about to disturb
somebody who's been hating us
for 30 years or more.
Couldn't we just say
that the war is over?
He'd probably kill us,
talking to a guy who
peppers you with bullets
is plain suicide.
I know way to reach Kamasuka.
You save us from pirates, we
give you war car with cannon.
(speaking foreign language)
It's good banana.
Yeah, great.
Where is he taking us?
How should I know?
He keeps talking
about bananas.
Relax, Charlie.
(speaking in foreign language)
Look here, a Japanese tank.
There's no way
Kamasuka can stop us now.
Oh yeah?
And who's gonna get
this tin can running?
That's not the
problem, Charlie.
Who knows how to drive it?
That's the easy part.
Get inside and do as I tell you.
Aye, aye sir.
Shut up.
(speaking foreign language)
Yeah, that's
called Tango boys.
No Tango, Kamasuka.
[Charlie] Will you shut up?
How's it look in there?
Huh?
The steering wheel's gone.
[Charlie] It's not a
wheel, there's sticks.
[Alan] Oh yeah, here they are.
Let's hope the jets
haven't fizzled out,
otherwise we'll never make it.
[Alan] How can
a jet be in here?
Is the gyropin in there?
[Alan] What's a gyropin?
[Charlie] It's a crank
to turn the motor over,
knucklehead.
Couldn't you say crank?
No, it's gotta be
called by it's right name.
Anulu?
That's me.
Yeah, take this.
For Anulu.
Get going.
Ready now?
You in the drivers seat?
I'm sitting in it.
Now what.
Open up the fuel line.
[Alan] Where is it?
Okay, okay.
[Alan] Everything is
written in Japanese, Charlie.
Yeah.
You ready?
[Alan] For what?
(exploding)
(speech drowned out by motor)
Take your foot off the brake.
(yelling)
(screaming)
(crashing)
(yelling)
(singing)
Good thing it ran out of gas.
It just wouldn't stop.
[Charlie] You could've
tried putting your foot back
on the brake.
Ah, you drive.
I intend to.
That's enough Anulu.
We're at war now.
See my war hat.
Patton, General Patton.
Hey, get over there.
Okay, Captain,
you give the orders.
You're the boss.
Yeah.
This here's a cannon.
What do you know, I
thought it was the horn.
These start the engines.
One and two.
Okay.
(engine humming)
Well, okay.
War, General Patton, war.
Oh.
(laughs)
(talking in foreign language)
Anulu, Anulu,
open, open, open.
Hey, Anulu's on
top of the tank.
He wants us to open up.
We got to right,
we got to right.
He's saying we gotta go
right, we gotta go right.
You going right?
Yeah.
(singing)
(speaking Japanese)
(laughing)
That's it, that's
probably the so-called fort
that Brady charted.
But how do we get that
kamikaze out of there?
Hey Anulu.
What's in the fort?
(mumbles)
(beeping)
[Charlie] What do you see?
Nothing yet.
He's coming out now.
I can see the
whites of his eyes.
(speaking Japanese)
And he can see ours.
[Charlie] What's he doing?
[Alan] He's
going up the tower.
Why doesn't he
shoot at the tank?
Because he thinks
it's Japanese.
[Alan] Oh yeah.
(shooting)
What happened?
I don't know.
(shooting)
Wait, I come too, I come too.
(shooting)
Why is he shooting?
I don't know.
(shooting)
(exploding)
He's throwing grenades.
(screams)
Pull the string,
start using the cannon.
What?
Go on, go on.
The cannon.
Yes, sirie.
(exploding)
Hey Captain?
Yeah?
Which one?
This one.
Okay, here.
(crashing)
- Hey Captain.
- Come on.
Stop yelling.
I'm ready, tell me when.
Now.
(singing)
All clear.
[Alan] Okay.
Hey, a grenade.
Be careful.
[Alan] Huh?
(exploding)
(yelling)
No ammunition,
yankee. (Laughs)
Woah.
Bonzai.
Bonzai.
No I say bonzai.
Bonzai.
Bonzai.
Hey.
Quit playing war now.
Where go, where go Kamasuka?
Where go Kamasuka?
(mumbling)
So I great warrior
but I defeated because
they attacked me
with a tank.
How did they get it Anulu?
Who gave it to them?
My Mama tank.
Well Mama told me
to give the tank.
What, he's your son?
Unfortunately, yes.
40 years ago Mama still
beautiful princess.
Not like today.
When I was left alone on island,
I search for company
like all honorable men.
We used to meet every
evening, Mama and I.
Beneath the tall palms
near the river and...
And Anulu's the result.
But I disowned him.
(speaking foreign language)
And now, I am dishonored too.
I ask your pardon to
leave your presence.
Yeah, if it'll
make you feel better.
(mumbling)
Okay Charlie, let's
start digging.
No, you're better at it.
Would Kamasuka try to
commit harry carry?
He just might.
No, hold it.
What you do, I must.
Cut that out for
crying out loud.
Still playing tin soldier.
The war ended 36 years ago.
Now the US and Japan get
along pretty good together.
I have fallen in disgrace.
I come from a long
line of warriors.
Your boys are finished,
they got new warriors now.
With up to date weapons.
Like watches, look,
with music inside, look.
Oh my god. (Electronic music)
I was always crazy
about watches.
(mumbling) Kawasaki.
Oh kawaski yes,
miniature motorcycle king.
Those teeny motors.
Captain Fujiama.
No kasamjama is a comic strip.
Or no...
Well, anyway.
Japan today, they say, is the
most important industrialized
country in the world.
They'll make anything.
Radios, transistors,
cars, you know Toyota?
Toyota?
She's my auntie.
She's a great lady of the night.
Yeah, well, I
got an Aunt Honda.
(crying)
Come on, don't say that.
You probably are
crazy. So is my friend.
(grunting)
Well, you hit a spring, I see.
Hey knucklehead.
Hey Kamasuka, I've been
digging for a hidden treasure.
Would you know
where it is exactly?
Hidden treasure?
You see?
Never heard of it.
There is no hidden treasure.
No, no, come on Kamasuka.
Don't hold out on us.
I know it's here.
Is that why you come here?
You can bet on it.
I think I know what
you're talking about.
Follow me.
Many years ago, this
door always kept locked
with two guard on duty
but now, guards not here
anymore so I go one, two, open.
You follow.
My god.
Here, is this what
you're looking for?
Wow.
Hey.
The treasure,
look, the treasure.
The treasure!
The treasure.
The treasure.
Oh, now that you
found the treasure,
you're gonna faint on me?
All this loot, hundreds
of, no no, thousands,
millions of dollars.
Millions yes but
of no use to you.
No use to us?
We could put it in
a bank and live off
the interest for the
rest of our lives.
There are no banks in
Bongo Bongo and no way
to leave island.
(plane roaring)
We can build a raft.
(yelling)
(mumbles)
Impossible.
Eagle, like a big bird.
(plane engine roaring)
[Man] Look down below.
I see it, I see it.
According to the map,
it's Bungo Bungo.
Yeah, Brady's famous
treasure island.
It better be or he'll
wish he were dead.
If he ain't already.
(laughing)
Well I had to convince him.
Yeah and cracked his left arm.
Well if I cracked his right,
he wouldn't have been able
to draw us another map.
(laughing)
Oh no, I can't believe it.
It's Frisco.
You know those dudes?
Yeah, I know them.
They're the guys who were
after me when I had to hide
in your boat.
It's like feeding you to the
sharks all over again, huh?
Yeah.
Okay you guys,
let's get the bundle
and get out of here.
Okay move it.
According to the map, the
fort's just beyond those palms.
Let's move.
These guys will
kill you for nothing.
How are we going
to defend ourselves
when we have no ammunition left?
Hey, maybe we
can do without it.
Anulu?
I've got an idea.
Let's stick together.
It's gotta be through here.
Always north?
Yeah.
Brady was a
lush, don't forget.
Shut up.
That's enough, keep it moving.
Less than 300 yards.
I don't see nobody.
That much the better.
Yeah, keep your
eyes open though, huh?
Hello.
Who is that?
No, don't shoot.
Anulu, me Anulu.
No, no, no.
You look for treasure.
What the hell do you
know about the treasure?
Oh I know, look, see.
This must be the copy that
Brady gave to his nephew, Alan.
Yeah, Alan get big treasure.
He beat us to it, that's
what he's telling us...
No, no, hold it.
You're a good boy, huh?
Good boy.
Me good boy like you.
Good yes.
Yeah, you tell us
where treasure is
and you'll be allowed to
taste American heritage.
Good for corns.
What?
Good for his corns.
We go, huh?
Yeah, lead away.
Pretty fast pace.
Just follow him.
What's the big hurry, boss?
Hey, he's beginning to run.
Alright, come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Where is this
treasure, anyhow?
How should I know?
Keep moving.
Keep going.
Come back here, you pineapple.
(yells)
(yelling)
Okay Papa Kamasuka.
[Kamasuka] Stop where you are.
Put your hands
up on your head.
The trigger on his
gun is a little loose.
Sorry boys, the
treasure hunt's over.
We got here first.
We'll see about that.
I knew it, there is a treasure.
What do you think?
We came here for a vacation?
There's a nice cage waiting
for you down at the village.
Come village.
Anulu my son.
You know what to do.
Son of a no good jack.
What you say?
You speak bad my Pa.
Now wait a minute, hold it.
What are you doing?
(yelling)
(gong rings)
(singing)
Thank you.
Thank you that for
Pa and Mama marry.
(cheering and clapping)
(singing)
What are they gonna do to us?
Fatten us up for the kill.
(singing)
(drumming)
For you, speak
to Kamasuka, you.
No you.
(clapping)
May I come in Your
Highness, Kamasuka?
You asked to see me.
I thought newlyweds like to
be alone on their first night.
My beloved husband
wishes to speak with you.
Ah, what's up?
Tell him.
This secret
orders of (mumbles)
to be opened only
when fort evacuated.
And so now, I opened it.
What's it say?
It say money not worth
paper it printed on.
What?
It's counterfeit.
It's counterfeit.
Completely worthless.
Can't even buy a
hamburger with it.
Oh Mama, it's not possible.
What do I tell Charlie?
He's gonna kill me.
(clapping)
Oh god help me, Mama.
[Mama] Don't despair, my boy.
You have done much for us.
We give you this treasure.
Oh.
Mama.
My boy, we feel happy
if you would accept
gift from the heart.
That's very kind.
[Kamasuka] It is
our only treasure
but it is yours.
Thank you Kamasuka,
thank you Mama
but please don't say anything
to Charlie about the money.
I'm sure he won't mind
if I keep this treasure
as a memento.
You're leaving the island?
I'm afraid so.
Without him, I hope.
He's here to stay.
How could anyone
separate the two of you?
[Mama] Kamasuka.
(talking)
Hey Charlie it's
Anulu, avocado.
No good twinkly
blood-eyed coniving snake.
Thought you could
fake me out, huh?
(upbeat music)
(groaning)
Dear Double Crosser,
I'm taking the treasure
to make up for the
loss of my boat
and for all the trouble
you've caused me.
I'm leaving and I hope
I never see you again.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Huh?
(speaking other language)
Bongo bongo.
I'm sorry, I didn't
get the last part.
You for to go?
Yeah, I might as well.
No point in hanging around.
You first (mumbles)
You wanna what?
Ah, a good bye kiss.
Goodbye kiss you
said, no let's say,
so long for now 'cause
Charlie's coming back, yeah.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Now I'm too sad, Charlie
leave Bongo Bongo.
Very sad if Charlie leaves.
But it's just temporary.
Like I told, look
I'll be back before
you can say goodbye
Charlie dear.
First Charlie give
me kiss, please.
You don't say please, you say.
Oh Charlie.
Don't go, Charlie.
Hey, what is this,
some sort of conspiracy?
Wait for me, too, wait.
Please, before leave,
give bliss to me
as promise of love.
You want bliss, huh?
(upbeat music)
(plane roaring)
Hello, hello, testing
frequency radio.
Can anyone hear me?
Come in please, over.
Hello, hello, anyone on
this frequency, please?
[Radio] US Aircraft
Carrier Forstall here.
Aircraft Carrier Forstall,
we hear you loud and clear.
Give us your position and
identification please.
Hello, hello.
I'm afraid I don't recall
the letters of this aircraft
or it's position.
Maybe you can help me out.
[Radio] You're
approximately 100 miles away.
You've gotta be kidding.
Beg your pardon?
No it's only, I was taking
a look at the fuel gauge.
I don't think I can
cover 100 miles.
Could you possibly
come a little closer.
Why did you take off
if you were low on fuel?
I made a boo-boo.
What was your
point of departure?
Oh well that's
easy, I took off
from the island of Chowkey,
not more than 25 minutes ago.
The airstrip of
Chowkey was destroyed
in the last world war.
You better get your
story straight up there.
My plan is an anphib,
goes on water, bye.
Man oh man.
Where's my beer?
It's over here, I've got it.
Relax.
Hey, double-crossing, no.
No Charlie, you
can't ask me to leave,
I haven't got a parachute.
How is it possible
you got onboard?
No, no, no, don't
tell me, I know.
You made those three
little fickle chippies
follow me so I'd waste time
and you'd get on board first.
You were gonna
leave me alone on
that almost deserted island
and take off with
all that money.
By the way, it's fake.
How's that?
Fake, make believe,
phony, counterfeit.
You mean after all the
trouble you put me through,
the dough is fake?
It's not my fault.
The US government
got the bright idea
of fighting Japan with
fake money, not me.
I'll bat your
pretty little head in,
you no good son of a
sidewinder, I'll kill you.
[Alan] We're going down,
we're going down, Charlie.
[Charlie] Blaming the US
government, shame on you.
Look at it this way,
when the US Treasury finds
out what we discovered,
they'll give us
a medal for sure.
Government'll give us a medal?
Without a doubt.
We'll be handing all
those phony dollars over
to the US Navy instead of
letting those creeps get
to it.
They're gonna make
heroes out of us.
Come on Charlie,
call the Forestall.
Hello Charlie, hello Alan.
(mumbles) Hello Alan,
Charlie, it's Kamasuka,
can you hear me?
Charlie, Alan, Kamasuka
calling Charlie, Alan.
I hope you can hear me in sky.
Bad pirates come back to island
also gangsters in cage free.
They want treasure.
I say we got no treasure,
they say you got treasure.
We tell them treasure
is not on island.
They say they will kill
all women and babies.
Hello, hello, Charlie, Alan.
You hear me?
[Frisco] What are you
trying to pull on me?
It's Frisco.
They took off
without the treasure.
(talking)
I'll blow your brains
out, understand?
Hey Frisco,
we've got the money
so keep your hands
off those people.
Take it easy, Alan.
We can pick up their
signal but their radio
ain't powerful enough to get us.
Well what should we do?
We can't leave them
to those creeps.
I don't suppose we can.
Forstall, Forstall,
I'm sorry to bother you,
old buddy, afraid I'm gonna
run plum outta gas soon
so I'll fly and land in
the back of the island.
Anyway, found something
may interest you.
Over and out.
(plane roaring)
Charlie, it's
none of my business,
but do we have enough gas
to get back to the island?
Nope.
No?
There's about two
gallons left in here.
But I think that'll be
good enough to shoo us in.
What do you mean?
Like birds flapping
their feathers.
Look at the gulls as
they rise high until
their block, allowing them
to land light on the earth.
They flick their tails to port,
these wing sailors.
The wind is a friend,
instinct their only thought.
The wind, aircurrentss,
instinct, great.
But if those shouldn't work,
they've got wings to fly.
Who's gonna give
us wings to flap?
Oh our guardian angels.
Oh no.
(speaking foreign language)
Shut up and that
goes for you too Q-ball
and your indigenous son.
The bone (mumbles)
Beast?
You take advantage
because Charlie and Alan
are not here to help us.
You see this gun?
It's the only left loaded
on the whole island.
There are six bullets in here.
The odds are with me.
Don't, my god, my god.
Shut up back there.
(laughs)
And now there are just two left.
One for you and one
for your banana boy.
Don't worry son.
Alan and Charlie
will come to save us.
No, you gonna die
Papa, boom, boom, dead.
(upbeat music)
Oh my god.
(crashing)
(shooting)
Alan, Charlie, hurry.
Well, get him,
there's only two of 'em,
you slobs.
Get with it, go on.
Alan, give me a hand.
(groaning)
(groaning)
Here.
Thanks.
Don't worry, it's
just a little shock,
hold still, hold still.
It's fine.
(groaning)
Charlie, there's four.
Anulu, you okay?
Sorry about that Anulu.
Shall I straighten him out?
Yes, certainly.
Thank you good.
Drop on the head is
good for him now and then.
Sorry.
(groaning)
(laughs)
(yells)
(groaning)
Drop dead.
(yells)
My bad eye.
He's good.
(groaning)
(groaning)
Goodbye.
No, Anulu.
[Anulu] Oh Mama.
[Mama] Anulu, Anulu.
Why are you here
in woman's cage?
Shame on you.
(speaking in foreign language)
Stupid swords.
No, no the feet, not again.
Not the feet, your hands.
Hold it, hold it, you ready?
Ready.
(groaning)
Go get him you worms.
I said go get him.
Kill them, pulverize
them, disintegrate them.
Make meatballs out of them.
Yeah, they'll feel sorry.
(groaning and yelling)
(yelling)
What's the mean?
I didn't catch it.
I got the gist.
Bonzai.
Oh bonzai again.
(laughs)
Okay.
Yeah.
Who us?
Keep me covered.
I don't have my wig.
Whatever you say.
My head.
Sorry.
Thank you so much.
(cheering)
(clapping)
Thank you Alan and Charlie.
Mama wishes to thank
her two friends
for your goodness and wishes
to offer to them both
my three daughters.
Three for two?
The odd number would
create a problem.
Yeah.
(yelling)
The Forstall notified
the Coast Guard like
I said they would.
That's what I said.
Yeah.
Listen, we're gonna
take those creeps
and the treasure and hand
them over to the military.
You go find some place where
they can't see your people.
Really, why?
They'll see a deserted island
and you won't be bothered.
Alan is right and
Charlie's a prophet.
(foreign language)
Alan and Charlie.
Everybody now,
hide, hide, go hide.
I say thank you great warrior
but I wish to remain on island
because your world
make me feel sick.
(laughs)
Listen, about this loot,
you really sure?
Sure about what?
Handing those beautiful
bills to the military?
Sure, I'm sure.
They're fake, aren't they?
Hey, do you want me to think
you're thinking something
you shouldn't be thinking?
Not me.
You're the one that's
thinking about it.
Yeah.
265 million, 270, 280 million,
285 million.
Sure is a great
privilege for me
to be the first to
congratulate you.
You've shown a great
deal of courage.
And let's go right
ahead and say it,
a lot of wholesome
honesty too, yesire.
Thanks, Major.
But any law-abiding
citizen would have done
the same thing.
Just a bunch of no good paper.
Did you hear that Wallace?
They're calling
this no good paper.
I wouldn't mind
having some of it,
seeing what my
paycheck brings in.
Come on.
You don't really mean
that the money is real.
Sure.
Navy's been looking
for it for years.
Yeah, would've been bad
news if it had fallen
into the wrong hands.
How much is it?
300,470,923 good
old American dollars.
Excuse me.
How much did you say?
And they're not fake.
[Charlie] And
they're not fake.
During the war, the
high command spread
the word around that
the money was no good.
And fortunately the
Japanese government fell
for it and left it here.
It was the pay
money the 11th fleet
was supposed to get
over 40 years ago.
There was only one
man who knew about it,
fellow named Brady.
Oh Brady.
Yeah, he fought in this area
but he never
divulged the secret.
By the way, take a minute, Walt.
We're gonna have to find Brady.
Certainly deserved
(mumbles) for what he did.
Yeah, I'd say three
percent at least.
Thanks again Mr. O'Brien.
We can't publicize the
fact that you notified
it so it's top secret.
I'm sure that when the
president hears about it,
he'll wanna congratulate
you in person.
[Alan] Charlie?
Is there anything
wrong, Mr. O'Brien?
Uh huh.
No, he's just moved by
the whole thing, that's all.
Well can I give
you boys a lift?
Me, thanks, I.
I got a few things to do here.
And him too.
Right?
Right.
I meant thanks but no thanks.
Alright, let's go.
Okay gentlemen, moving out.
Bye.
(upbeat music)
Get down you chicken
livered blue eyed rat.
You'll strain
yourself, Charlie.
Here give me a hand.
Forget it.
Come back here, you beggar.
No.
You've got hate in your eyes.
Oh I've got it
in my heart too.
You see, that's
not nice, Charlie.
No, I ain't nice at all.
Hey, look what else
is in here, Major.
Huh, well I don't think
it's worth anything.
Bet it does belong
to those two guys.
We'll send it on their behalf
to the anthropological
museum in Washington.
Their experts there
will appraise it.
Yes sir.
Hey guys, look.
Nice huh?
[Man] Yeah, I got
on in my locker.
Hell you do.
(upbeat music)
As they say, he who loses
a treasure finds a friend.
Yeah.
Or no.
(upbeat music)
