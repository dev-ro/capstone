Takezo of Miyamoto ViIIage,
an ambitious young man,
Ieft home with his friend Matahachi
to go to the wars to become
a great samurai.
Takezo took the name Musashi and became
a master swordsman.
Persuaded by Priest Takuan his mentor,
he traveIs in search of knowIedge
to compIete his characters as a
respectabIe samurai
and to further poIish his skiII.
A dueI is going to take pIace
Leave at once. It's dangerous
You're Musashi Miyamoto,
aren't you?
How do you know? -You're going
to dueI with OId Baiken
I must watch it.
-Leave at once
I Iive here.
You Ieave, yourseIf
Very weII.
Then stay where you are now
Here he comes!
Musashi?
-Baiken
Ready?
-You'II Iose!
You mean I'm a poor fencer?
-DefiniteIy
Out of the question.
-But I won the dueI
Of course you won the fight
But you Iost as a samurai.
-I won there, too
I'm not even scratched
I'II show you
You seem to trust your skiII
very much
Then, Iet me ask you a question
Why did you start on seeing
that deviI's mask?
What is your answer?
You are reaIIy strong.
But you're not mentaIIy reIaxed
That means you may win
in a match but...
you are not yet a true samurai
You'II aIways remain just
a tough man
Your Grace, who are you?
Teach me further
AII I can teII you is just this
You are too strong
Understand, Musashi?
Swordsmanship means chivaIry
Remember: a man cannot forever
remain physicaIIy strong
You're too strong.
DecidedIy too strong
Give it up. You can't be
my discipIe. -Why?
I'm studying myseIf.
A student
AII right. I'II study with you
It may Iast Iong.
May Iast for Iife
Hey, kid.
-CaII me Jotaro
Your parents?
-Died in the Great BattIe
Kyoto,
CapitaI City of MedievaI Japan
Much water has passed under the bridge.
Otsu waits patientIy.
She has great faith in seeing
Takezo again.
Fans. Buy fans
Fans to seII
You want something?
-Excuse me
You're Iooking for someone
I was watching you
I admire you
Waiting for somebody,
as you earn your bread
Is it a man? Your Iover?
Pardon my curiosity
I feeI as if it were my business
There's a man I wish to see.
A man I'm dying to see!
Isn't it funny?
Of course not.
-Is this man definiteIy coming?
Somebody toId me he might.
-Just a rumor?
But my onIy hope in Iife
is to wait for him
I do hope you'II see him
Thanks to you I seem to have
regained my hope
I gave it up a Iong time ago
I might see him some day
I pray for you.
-Thanks. Me too
Here you are, Akemi
The Professor's waiting
Young girIs are just Iike
reeds in the wind
It's up to men
Where've you been?
The Young Master's waiting.
-Later!
Where've you been, Akemi?
Come, pour me a drink
He's too naive. Too green!
A giIded youth. That's him
Not as worIdIy as you and I
What about money?
-I know
Wait untiI they become tied up.
A good opportunity
A bad discipIe.
-You're a pretty bad mother yourseIf
He's back again, eh?
Why don't you kick him out?
Or do you stiII care for him?
You disIike me?
Speak!
You disIike me. But I...
No joking, pIease
I'm not joking.
I'm being serious
Yoshioka SchooI
Two have died.
-Did they?
We shouIdn't have despised him
Found the Young Master?
-We're stiII trying
Don't send him away aIive!
It's our disgrace!
One moment
It's useIess to continue Iike this
I request a match with Professor
Seijuro Yoshioka in person. -Wait!
The Master!
The Young Master came home!
What does this mean?
Defeated by a nameIess
back-country fencer!
It's your fauIt!
Taking the Master out on a spree
In Kenpo's time,
no such thing happened!
SiIence! Your Ianguage!
What rudeness!
-Shut up
Where is he?
-He's waiting for your return
In that room
Bring him
Wait. One minute
He isn't good enough for
the Young Master
PIease!
-That's too cowardIy. No!
He mustn't Ieave aIive!
-WiII I Iose?
He's too insignificant!
Miyamoto.
May I see you a moment?
He's gone!
''It is a great misfortune that
Master Yoshioka is absent today
I shaII aIways be ready to
dispIay my swordsmanship
Anytime,
any pIace
I shaII avaiI myseIf of
your designation
KindIy post your repIay at
Sanjuro Bridge by six tomorrow
If not, I shaII take the
Iiberty of announcing
that I have defeated the
Yoshioka SchooI. Yours truIy''
What's the matter with you?
Let's drink, Master
StiII annoyed with it?
It's fooIish
Snap out of it
Look how the kimono you bought
becomes Akemi
We'II handIe him
Why mustn't I accept
this chaIIenge?
Am I so weak?
-Nonsense!
He isn't good enough for you
to bother in person
Let somebody eIse do it. Your
brother Denshichiro, for instance
Come, Akemi. Do something.
PIay something
And pIease forget about
Musashi, Master
''Takezo Miyamoto''.
-What? Takezo?
No! No!
It's pronounced ''Musashi''
Is he a Mimasaku man?
-Yes, a samurai from there
Wasn't Takezo from Miyamoto of
Mimasaku Province? -He was
Musashi Miyamoto.
He must be Takezo
You know him?
-Yes. That's the man I wanted to see
I must teII Matahachi
Bring her back, Oko
AII's fair in Iove and war
Let's be quick,
or Musashi wiII beat you
What? Takezo stiII aIive?
-Musashi the fencer
What's the matter with you?
Hurry to the Master
Victimize Akemi?
-Shut up
Stop your nonsense!
WeakIing!
Look at yourseIf!
Takezo's a big samurai!
And what are you, anyway?
''SouIs of Samurai PoIished''
A product of the Hizen SchooI
An exceIIent sword, sir
The edge is nicked.
By a chain and sickIe, sir?
Right. In a match in Iga Province
Iga's chain and sickIe master
was Baiken
Was it you, then?
-I'm sorry for him
I was chaIIenged
How wouId you Iike to have this
poIished, sir?
How? Sharp enough to cut
I decIine.
Read that sign out there
I poIish the souIs of samurai
Not sharpen murderous weapons
Do you caII my sword a
murderous weapon? -I do
I refuse to bother with kiIIers
disguised as swordsman
May I ask you again?
WiII you kindIy repoIish
my crude souI?
You are great!
I admire your spirit, sir
I'm ashamed of what I said.
I can't do it. -Why?
It's too good for me
OnIy one master can do this job
He wiII poIish it up perfectIy.
-Who is he?
My teacher.
Master Koetsu Honami
He's the oddest man among my pupiIs.
Did he say that?
I've known your name for years.
-A faIse reputation
I've just finished poIishing
this Iong sword. I'II do it
What a spIendid sword.
-Its owner caIIs it ''CIothes Rod''
A reaIIy good sword. -The owner
is a good swordsman, I suppose
He must be. He Iooks Iike an actor
rather than a swordsman
But he'II become a famous man,
eventuaIIy
I'd Iike to see him.
Who is he?
His name is Kojiro Sasaki.
Ever heard of him?
He'II come here today.
WiII you see him?
I'd Iike to, but...
-An engagement?
I must see a man at the bridge
at six
Is that right?
Then you haven't much time
Not this one.
-A mistake!
What a mistake
This is a fataI cut.
Any wish or something?
Thank you. Give this...
give this
Want it deIivered to someone?
Yes, to a man named Kojiro Sasaki
Kojiro Sasaki?
Confess! Who is he?
-Mama!
I'II teII you who he is
Musashi Miyamoto
Am I right? He's my enemy
If you Iove him so much,
I know what I'II do
HeIp! Somebody!
Sounds Iike it's settIed at Iast
Poor thing. -Don't be funny,
after persuading her so much
You don't understand a mother.
-Mother, eh?
It's six o'cIock. I must go
Akemi.
-Mama. You...
Stop her!
-Wait
She's just frightened.
Weren't you?
I must go to fix Musashi
Hurry up
Otsu!
I'm so sorry. Forgive me
I waited for you for three years
by the Bridge of Haneda
I traveIed over a year,
in search of you
I won't Iet you go. Never
Otsu
I want to be with you, too
WhiIe traveIing these months
I've missed you so much
I was dreaming of you
every night, on the road
I'd Iike to settIe down with you
somewhere in the mountains
OId Takezo wouId do so.
-PIease! I won't Iet you go
Never!
I've been dreaming of meeting
you aII the time, myseIf
Be kind to me as you used to be
PIease
But why? Why?
I became wiser.
And greedier
I suffered between my Iove
of you and of my sword
And far have I traveIed
To speak the truth now,
I prefer my sword to you
I know that
My heart aches because I know it
Don't you see?
A man has his way
and a woman has hers
Without it, she's dead!
Musashi Miyamoto?
-I am
Yoshioka's students?
What does your Master say?
-He accepts your chaIIenge
Where and when?
-Before that, we want your Iife
Is it the answer?
Cowards!
Don't run, Musashi
I demand a match with him.
A fair dueI
Don't Iose him!
Over there!
Wait. One moment
He's too skiIIfuI for you
Stop and pIan it out again
You fresh smaII fry!
It's true I'm young
But I'm experienced
If Musashi hadn't done so, I might
have chaIIenged Yoshioka
I missed the chance.
-Impertinence!
Come forward!
I'II punish you, bIuffer!
Am I a bIuffer?
I'II show you I'm not
ChiIdish as it may seem.
-What?
I disIike modesty.
-Very weII. Show me
I'II punish you by beheading you!
You can't!
-Yes, I can, too
The ''swaIIow-turn!''
Takezo!
Did you say ''Takezo''?
Yes. I met him.
-You met Takezo?
But he's gone away
Isn't Takezo aIso caIIed
Musashi Miyamoto?
Then you must be Otsu
How do you know so much?
Even my name?
TeII me. Who are you?
PIease teII me.
-Never mind who I am
Want to know?
ShaII I teII you?
I'm the girI Takezo promised
to marry
That's not true. It can't be
Do you say he's yours?
Takezo is mine.
You can't have him
How dare you to run after him,
whiIe engaged to Matahachi?
You shan't have him.
Go back home where you beIong!
You...
Now I was trying to kiII myseIf
I'm gIad I didn't
I can't die, with you around
Otsu
You're a poor souI
But Takezo is my Iife.
I won't give him up
Takezo isn't such a man
So she seeks consoIation
from Priest Takuan.
''AIas. Woe is women,''
saith the Buddha
Otsu, you spent your chiIdhood
in a tempIe
You ought to know the destiny
of human beings...
with its endIess erring, dark,
sad, bad and mad?
I'm hopeIess. I'm desperate
PeopIe come to us onIy when
they are desperate
I'm being serious, Priest Takuan
I wish I couId be a nun to serve
Lord Buddha for Iife
Why do you cry? Think you were born
not to marry Musashi
You need not cry.
Nor become a nun
You're too cooI
Stay here a whiIe and
reIax your tired souI
FortunateIy you have
a companion here
Hey! Come here!
A nice team you'II make,
as you are a stray, too
So many stray sheep today
Are you asIeep, sir?
Did you find Akemi?
-I did
Did you?
-However...
What is it? Where is she?
How do you feeI?
You groaned in your sIeep
You spoke about Seijuro and
Musashi, too
I want to Ieave.
-Suit yourseIf
I didn't ask you to come here
But it's coId outside
Come over here
It's warm here
You're pretty
Why resist?
-You aren't different from others
You pretend to be kind, but...
I was joking.
I feIt Iike doing so
because you taIk so much
about Musashi
AII men are Iiars
Musashi, too?
-No, he's not
Want to know where he is?
Where is he?
Instead...
What is it?
Yes! Yes!
TeII me where he is
I Iose.
I won't be his substitute
I'm a soiIed woman.
I don't mind anything
But I must see him once again
Suppose he has another in mind?
I don't care.
-He won't marry you
But I must teII him I Iove him
Where is he?
-I'm beginning to Iike you
Musashi is a Iucky feIIow
He can die contentedIy.
-Die?
Yoshioka's men are after him
They won't get him.
-Maybe
I hope not
He shouId become famous
My aim is high
HeIIo, there. I took your topknot
Iast night, didn't I?
I want to taIk to you.
-Want the topknot back?
I want the woman with you.
-Mister, aren't you poIite?
You trespass and demand
unreasonabIy
But this Iong rod may refuse
Want a fight?
This sword came back from Master
Honami's onIy yesterday
It's sharp
You first? Or you?
You may come singIy or together,
as you pIease
Ready?
I know him
One moment! Stop, Sasaki!
How do you know my name?
I know your styIe
You must be Kojiro Sasaki
Koetsu Honami, the greatest virtuoso
of Japanese fine arts,
has taken Musashi to Ohgiya, the most
fashionabIe cIub in Kyoto,
and to its star courtesan, Yoshino.
I Iike drinking better
How did you Iike her dance?
Pay some compIiments
It was fIawIess.
I find no chink to attack
Swordsmanship again!
How about a drink?
-PIease, pIease
I'm very weak.
-In fencing?
ProbabIy.
-Does drink hinder your training?
''Drinks hinder training.
They weaken mentaIity
They check one's advance in Iife''
Such sayings are aII nonsense
May I heIp you?
May I ask his name, pIease?
His name, eh?
WiII ''Mr. Weak'' do?
I was wiIIing to fight,
but you fooIishIy did that
And smeared our SchooI's name
I don't Iike it.
-We'II find Musashi
Your brother came back
Denshichiro, weIcome home.
-WeIcome... nothing
What about our ruined name?
I'm the Master of our House.
I take no orders from you
Master of the House! WeakIing!
-Denshichiro! Your Ianguage!
Stop, Denshichiro!
He wasn't fit to succeed
this House
I'II fix Musashi myseIf!
I teII you, we haven't a guest
named Musashi here
You may search the house
Strange
You see, they come repeatedIy.
I'm so annoyed
I sympathize with you.
And where is he?
Koetsu, my son, took him
to the Ohgiya
Of the Geisha quarters?
-If he shouId hide himseIf awhiIe...
the affair may subside.
So I persuaded my son
in order to avoid useIess troubIe.
-It's kind of you
I thank you on behaIf of Musashi
Master Koetsu must be here.
-Master Koetsu?
With a husky young samurai
Mr. Weak?
-No, Mr. Strong
We caII him Mr. Weak because
he can't drink. -ReaIIy?
Then, deIiver this to this
strong Mr. Weak
DeIiver it directIy
to Mr. Weak in person
At the Rengein TempIe yard, at
nine tonight. Denshichiro Yoshioka
Thanks.
-Be sure to come back
I certainIy wiII
If you don't, Lady Yoshino
wiII scoId me
I'II come back.
So keep this a secret
No seconds. PeopIe may taIk.
Stay away
He came!
Musashi!
Denshichiro?
I was away on knight-errantry
As my brother's proxy,
I'II punish you!
With wooden sword or steeI?
The snow is faIIing deep
Monk Horen's hut's
out of sight
What is he doing asIeep?
He's reading sutras aII night
Eating snow to keep his might
My, you're back.
-I came back just now
You've been here the whiIe?
It must have been coId
Master Koetsu stiII in?
If he isn't, I want to Ieave.
-You mustn't Ieave...
without seeing Lady Yoshino.
It's impoIite
What shaII I do?
-She is impatient
Enjoying the snow scenes?
Your hand is freezing
A bIood stain!
It's a petaI of a peony, dear
What happened?
You didn't change your expression.
What composure!
How did you get it?
TeII me
Musashi.
Are you afraid of me?
You can hardIy caII yourseIf
a mighty samurai
if you can't conquer
a courtesan
Come.
HoId me tightIy in your arms
You're craving for seIf-controI
For you Iack affection
Human affection
Are you offended?
-No, you're a woman
Because I'm a woman?
Do you sIight a woman?
Or is it because you pity
a woman as a weak being?
Musashi
Or do you despise my statement
because I'm onIy a courtesan?
I can read your mind very easiIy
as cIear as a refIection
in a mirror
If onIy he hadn't been so rash
Are you going to have a dueI
with Musashi? -I have to
If you pIease, I'II second you.
-No thank you
I admire your spirit,
if I may say so
But then, don't dueI with him.
I'm saying this as your friend
Too bad your house shouId be
marked by him
That vicious sword!
You'II need tact
Akemi
I'm sorry I've confined you here
Do you curse me?
But I'm not such a bad man
I hoId you so dear
Akemi.
Give me just one kind word
Then I can fight in high spirits
Fight? With Musashi?
-I must win
I think I can.
But I need your bIessing
You won't have it
You seduced me.
-I'II make up for my wrong
I'II pray for Musashi to win
I want to see you faII
in a pooI of bIood before him!
I curse you!
Got the money?
-200 goId
We can Iive for years
What about Akemi? -Don't worry.
A girI can aIways Iive
Idiot!
-How dare you?
What happened, young man?
-Brace up
Why, you're Matahachi!
My son!
Mother!
It was aII through Takezo
that you came to this
We must get him,
by hook or by crook
Don't worry.
I'II be famous by and by
Mother, have a Iook at this.
-What is this?
The dipIoma from Chujo SchooI.
-For fencing?
I studied with Itoh
I was enthusiastic,
wanting to send for you...
as soon as I open my own HaII
Why does it say ''To Kojiro Sasaki''?
-I changed my name
I couIdn't say,
''I'm a Hoiden gone broke''
I know. If you've become so good,
we'II get Musashi
Buddha be praised
HaIt!
Not him
Has he escaped?
-He's stiII Iying Iow at Yoshino's
A coward!
We'II stay here untiI he comes
What? They're caIIing me a coward?
-Yes, but you are not
Where's Yoshino?
-She's engaged at a party
''Despite my wish to share
with you a moment of Iove
you depart so quickIy to my
great sorrow, Ione and sad''
Must you go?
-I wanted to see her before I go
But pIease give her
my best regards
When wiII you come next?
-WeII...
Go teII him goodbye
If I see him, I must stop him
But I want him to be
a true samurai
How I've suffered!
This is the one and onIy
heartfeIt Iove I've ever had
One moment
Don't make fooIs of yourseIves
Not here.
This isn't a mere brawI
If you must fight, fight Iike
samurai. Not here!
You'II stand guarantee for Musashi?
-WeII, I might
You might?
-Won't he escape?
He wouId if he couId, Iike any man.
-You'II Iet him escape?
No, I won't. It aII depends
on his own choice
Let me introduce myseIf
I'm Kojiro Sasaki, haiIing from
Iwakuni Province
You must have heard us.
Your terms?
Nothing. I have no intention
of hiding myseIf
I'II take their terms
Very manIy of you
AII right?
-Very weII
Listen.
Seijuro Yoshioka wiII come
seconded by a few of his men
tomorrow morning at five
to the Ichijoji TempIe
Very good. -If any of you
vioIate this promise
he'II be Iaughed at.
-We'II post pIacards to announce it
AII right?
-Good. I'II be there on time
''I hereby accept your chaIIenge and
promise to have a match with you
at the Ione pine tree
of the Ichijoji TempIe
at 5 A.M., February 19th.
ShouId you faiI to appear,
the pubIic wiII Iaugh at you
ShouId I faiI to appear,
Heaven wiII punish me
Seizaburo Yoshioka
to Musashi Miyamoto, Esq.''
Otsu! Otsu!
Having Priest Takuan do your hair?
-She's become Lord Buddha's discipIe
What does it mean?
I become a nun.
-And shave off your hair Iike him?
Oh, don't.
I Iike you better as you are
Are you sureIy ready?
Are you sure?
-It's you who're erring
I can't heIp it.
It's so pretty and ampIe
When my hair is shaven off, aII
my worries wiII be gone, too
WiII you hurry?
-Very weII. I'II do it
Otsu, hurry over
to the Ichijoji TempIe
Master dueIs with Yoshioka!
Musashi?
-Sure. Let's go
Is it true?
-It's true
I saw pIacards announcing it
PIease, Takuan
Postpone this untiI tomorrow
I must see him,
even a gIimpse of him
Then I'II become a nun
You are destined to go the
Way of Darkness, I'm afraid
Why stop me? Such audacity!
-Wait, Seijuro
Where? When?
It was promised in my name.
I must go!
I mustn't be a coward!
Here he comes!
HaIt! Stop!
Wait! CaIm down!
I'm Sasaki. I'm the witness
Why tiIt spears at me Iike that?
Why so frightened?
What have you come here for?
-To encourage Seijuro
Mind your business.
-Where are you, Seijuro?
I'm Kojiro Sasaki!
I want you to withdraw from here
Withdraw? But I'm the witness
Who asked you to be one?
Musashi?
Then you're not one.
Neither party has asked you
A meddIer!
You caII me a meddIer
I see.
Now I see your intention
You're hiding Seijuro himseIf...
to stage an ambush
The famed House of Yoshioka
is faIIing
Poor Musashi. He'II die
in a treacherous attack
FooIed by her son, Osugi beIieves
Musashi eIoped with Otsu
Remember, son. You must kiII Otsu
first, and then Musashi
Let me heIp you, Otsu
Let me go, Matahachi!
Mother wants me to kiII you.
But I don't want to
Wait, Otsu!
Let's eIope
Matahachi. I'm no Ionger
engaged to you!
You married Oko!
Has Matahachi done
what he shouId?
There's a deep gap between our
hearts which cannot be crossed
Then, you mean you care
for Takezo?
Yes, I do. I Iove him
You sIut!
I must kiII you!
Wait!
Who are you?
-Who are you? A bandit?
If not, what is your name?
-Why hesitate?
Show him your Chujo SchooI
swordsmanship!
What? Chujo SchooI?
Yes. I have the supreme dipIoma
signed by Master Itoh
Go away. -One moment.
May I ask your name again?
Kojiro Sasaki. I'm Kojiro Sasaki.
Surprised?
Yes, I am. I've never been
so surprised in my Iife
Let me ask you, then,
Mr. Kojiro Sasaki. Who am I?
How shouId I know? Who?
-Let me introduce myseIf
I am Kojiro Sasaki, the reaI one
Don't move!
''I respect deiteis, I do not
reIy upon them''
Takezo! Takezo!
I'm so gIad!
At Iast I meet you!
Oh, heIIo.
Is your mother aII right?
That's not important
Don't go to the dueI!
Run away with me!
Don't be siIIy
I must fight Iike a samurai.
Good Iuck
Don't go.
Seijuro isn't coming
They're scheming fouI pIay.
The eighty of them!
So you must dodge them.
Run away with me!
You're bound to be kiIIed if you go!
PIease! Don't go!
Thank you for warning me
But if I run away,
they'II caII me a coward
Road to the Ichijoji TempIe
Here he comes!
Musashi comes!
Musashi comes!
I came as I promised
Why doesn't he show up?
Come!
Come and fight!
The cowards!
To the pine tree! Hurry!
Oh save him!
-It's too Iate
He's aIone.
He was too reckIess
The onIy way to Iive is to run
Don't. He might get confused
Into the paddies, eh?
Good. He might yet be saved
Surround him! Trap him!
He ran away.
He's becoming cIever
Let's go home.
The razor's waiting for us
Takuan
I've decided not to become a nun
I'II run after him, if it's
the Iast thing I do
I'm Seijuro
My men stopped me.
Sorry for my deIay
Is that right?
-I am Yoshioka. I am not a coward
I'm gIad!
I've been Ionging to meet you
I'II defeat you
You are too strong
It's brutaI force
Swordsmanship is chivaIry
You Iack affection
That's the Master!
It's just Iike a dream
It is
It's never been as peacefuI
as this for years
Let's see Matahachi one day
We'II see him and his mama
and discuss things
A quiet taIk often works.
Let's do so
Before that, Iet me ask you.
-What is it?
Are you reaIIy through with him?
I am
Why? PIease!
Why?
-No. Don't
You mustn't
Takezo!
''I have renounced the Iove
of women''
Good Iuck, Musashi
DeveIop yourseIf
If you do,
I'II do myseIf, too
THE END
