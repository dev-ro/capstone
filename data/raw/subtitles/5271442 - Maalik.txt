I am a citizen, I want to say something
How did you get in? Where are the guards?
The guards are all here.
At this time of the night?
Needed your complete attention
Are you insane?
Do you realize the consequence of barging into my house like this?
And do you realize the consequence of not doing your work properly?
What consequences?
I will remove you and give this work to someone else
Obviously, when an employee does not work properly, the owner
replaces him
Hahahahahaha
Mr. Owner, as you are beaten in a lockup tomorrow
you will be able to understand my power
you will also appreciate the true ownership of the country
The power you enjoy is granted by the people not for personal ego
trips
but for the benefit the country and the people
This country
has everything even without you
You have nothing without the country
Here is a list..
of cases that you have delayed for years for your petty personal
benefits..
You have 15 days to decide these cases
Decide as you may, but decide you must
and from now on decide everything on time and on merit
Are you threatening me?
The owners never threaten an employee, they serve a notice
I, Muhammad Mohsin
(People repeating)
The Citizen of Pakistan
am the owner of Pakistan
This land
and the people
are mine
The government of this country
is appointed by me
and is answerable to me
I take a vow
to stand against
any individual
or organization
both foreign and domestic
that operates against my country
or violates the law of my land
and that I will
without considerations of association
language or religion
exercise my utmost strength to defeat them
For I
the citizen of Pakistan
Its real Owner
am the ultimate guarantee of its existence
Please bring me the file for Zahid enterprises
Ok, where is Hamza?
Its Ok, I will talk to him
Where are you Hamza?
Dad, I am coming from the yard, just crossed the tower
You have the Zahid enterprises file, right?
Yes dad, I am going to the gym before coming to the office
Okay son but be on time. I have to meet the lawyers
You arrogant rich man's son
What is it?
Donâ€™t know dad! this guy just fell of his bike and is accusing me
Hey step out
Hey man
Step out
Hamza what's happening? Where are you?
Dad, he fell down by himself and is now hitting my car
Hamza
Whatâ€™s wrong with you?
Sir wait, let me deal with him
what's his problem?
Sending out your dad eh?
What's the problem with you?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Move it from here
Hamza..What exactly is happening?
Oh shit
Tanu grab the gun
Run....
Hamza..Hamza..
Helloo!!
Hamzaaaa...
Hello
What are you looking at? Get lost
Mostly Altaf the snatchers take the victim along and force them to
draw money from the ATMs
they then set the victim free, at times they even take the car and
snatch the cell phones
Most probably Hamza will call you in a while
Hello..
Whats wrong Altaf?
Hamza has been kidnapped
I have said it over and over again
That I don't want to live in this country
This is a jungle, it is nothing but a lawless jungle
But you have no time or interest in anything except your business
Money, Money, Money is all that you are concerned with. Can you buy
me my son?
I can't imagine what Hamza must be going through right now
I hope he is okay?
Fatima please calm down a little
Calm down? It is so easy for u to say that. CALM DOWN?
He is a part of my blood and flesh. Do you understand that?
I canâ€™t breathe
Fatima, please have some patience
Patience
No! I donâ€™t want to be patient... I am not going to be patient...
and you, you went to the police? And what is the police going to do?
Answer me! What can the police do?
We will just pay them, whatever they want, and get our son back
and after that, I am not staying here anymore. Do you hear me?
Me and my son won't stay in this country anymore
I would like to meet Maalik please
He is right behind you
I am sorry, I donâ€™t understand
That's ok . . took me ages to understand it myself
How can we help you?
My son has been kidnapped. He is my only child
I have never bothered anyone
If something happens to him
His mother won't make it....
Please! Help me get my son back
We will get your son back, but
there is a question that you must answer first
Sure?
Why would Shamshair Singh risk his life
for Hamzaâ€™s life?
I am prepared to do anything
I will pay whatever you ask
Sheikh Sahib...
If money
could bring our loved ones back
I would have done it too
Then what is it that you want?
Eye for an eye Sheikh sahab
Commitment, ownership
your word
that when another Pakistani needs you
you will be prepared to do whatever it takes
If and when that moment arrives, I will hold nothing back
Clear... Clear
Please tell your DIG friend, we want all the forensic evidence
and if you have spare keys of the car, please get them
Yes, sure
Naeem...
Shorty ... yes sir
I need three teams
One will extract the car
The Second will provide cover on ground
Right
and the third will spot any tail from air
Okay sir
Right sir
Ssss.. when the pictures so sweet, I can imagine her in real?
tell me.... You mustâ€™ve tasted her eh?
Hey, what are you staring at?
I will pick her up too
Tie his hands
Yes boss! The package is ready
It's big game, I will cost you 5 million.
You are Sheikh Altafâ€™s son?
Yes
Bring him along
Hello

Please exclude the CNICs
and identify the rest of the prints
Okay how about this one?
Heâ€™s our Gardener

Who is he?
Letâ€™s find out
I am sending a cell number, please give me current location and Call
Detail Records

Come on quick
What is wrong with him?
I think heâ€™s having fits, must rush him to the hospital
Yes! Pick him up, let's take him
Hurry
Itâ€™s a positive match
You kidnapped Hamza sheikh yesterday and abandoned his Vehicle in
Malir. I want him back.
What the hell is this? My uncle is inspector of police
You donâ€™t know me.. I am a party worker
When we are done with you no one will recognize your body
No no no... donâ€™t do this
I will tell u everything
We are 1 brother and 2 sisters
I am asking for the last time
OK OK ...
We sold him on to a man named Rasheed
he lives in defense, his cell number 030....
Shorty . . calls were made to this number, bring him in
Leave him tied to the chair all night
No food... no water
tomorrow we take him to the village
and break him
Its him . . move in.
Okay
This is Mr. Rasheed's house?
Yes it is
Actually, I am invited tonight.
Is this address correct?
Wait here and someone will come?
Excuse me, madam, where are you going?
Mr. Rasheed is upstairs?
Yes, he is. I will take you there
Come in
It's okay relax.. just relax.. Alright?
Keep this, he won't be needing it ..
Look! There is definitely a mistake. You can call my dad, he is a
senator
I am a man of substance
In the next 30 min, your substances will be swell
an hour later they'd by totally numb
even if your dad is the prime minister
there would be no option but to amputate your substances
You will get up, when I get Hamza
till then have a chill time on the ice. Excuse me Iâ€™ll be back.
Just a minute
I can try
Listen please
Bring me my phone I will find out . .
Just chill man, I will be right back after offering my prayers
Bullshit!!
You are wasting your time with a cheap gangster.
How much are they asking to get Hamza back?
Hey, they donâ€™t want money
Its not about money. These are nice people
What nonsense?
Nobody does anything without money
Chilling eh?
There is a flat near Saba Avenue
Hamza is on the 3rd floor
How many men?
two
armed?
Yes
Vehicles?
No
Okay
I will give you the phone
Tell them that you are sending a vehicle over; they should put Hamza
in the vehicle.
There's a vehicle waiting outside. Send the boy right now
Move
Here . . donâ€™t be scared
Major Hassan here
Son, you have been extracted
And you are totally out of danger now

Oh,no.. donâ€™t be afraid....
Itâ€™s ok..
You are safe..
You are safe, kid
Yeah
We have a child here
He is in a pretty bad shape
his fingers have been chopped as well
The wound looks pretty bad
We are bringing him in
You know I donâ€™t like you
Who is the kid?

You canâ€™t do that. Thatâ€™s cheating! Tch..
Baba, this is why I never play with her
What do you mean itâ€™s cheating. Baba I canâ€™t do that right?
No you canâ€™t. You just made that rule yourself
Ujji learn how to act your age
You canâ€™t do it from the right but you can do it from the left
Assalam o Alaikum

Please sit down
How are you feeling son?
I am good Sir, thank you and your people, sir. Thank you
Thatâ€™s Great all went well
sir we came over to thank you
I am so gratified to you for helping us
I don't have words to thank you enough.
I can never repay you.
You have not only saved our son, but
our entire family, we would have fallen apart
We were..
We were in unimaginable agony
Mam . . No obligations are necessary..
in fact, where are my manners? Would you like to have something?
No thank you so much

It's been a very long day and we are drained

Him actually..
So boss..
Good work sherry
How is the child?
Actually, I put him to the hospital
Poor soul was so sick and completely petrified
You know they were holding him for 5 weeks
Can you believe that?
Physically, he is going to be ok but.. mentally he is scarred for
life
What kind of humans are these?
I am telling u, boss, they are not humans
You should give me some free hand
You shouldâ€™ve seen his parents
They were walking dead
We literally pulled them out of their graves and of course..
they want to see you and show you their gratitude tomorrow
Invite them over at 11
I am gonna take off, boss?
Sure
Okay

Sir, I am going too
You have a good night
Dad, you need to talk to him. He is crazy

Azal I have an amazing idea

Hurry, come
OMG Sherry will beat the crap out of you
Sherry..
Ujji what are you doing? What is wrong with you?

Will you marry my brother?
Is he asking that?
No, I swear to God, I didnâ€™t say anything, come on
Letâ€™s go,Ujji, come on, letâ€™s go.. Ujji come on
Well??
I didnâ€™t think so either.. let him ask and then Iâ€™ll tell
Ujji, you are sleepy you act insane when you are sleepy
Dad
Dad, please talk to him
After that.. they will surrender themselves at the police station..
and confess to their crimes
and be sentenced by the courts for at least 10 years in prison
and tell your lawyers not be too smart ..
But.. But you just canâ€™t let them go away..
They will never do what you are asking them to..
They will run away
Donâ€™t worry nobody has ever run away
Relax...Relax...
and one last thing
I really don't like your faces
so if you get out of prison before ten years
we will be waiting for you
Assalam o Alaikum Dad
Walaikum Asalam
Dad, it's time
Yeah . . . there is no cure for time
Dad I'm going to do it
You are an idealist, like your mother
Dad.. you agreed
It is the highest level
Without idealism, there is nothing
Dad do take care of yourself
take your medicines
I don't want to break jail
Nahhh . . I am a tough goat
Take care dad
Goodnight
So Mr. Asad.. you are saying, that you have killed two men?
I have killed many men
but except the two.. rest were in line of duty
Let me get this straight
There must Incident Reports for these murders
Uh no..
Eye witnesses?
Uhhh no..
The families must have filed a report?
No..In both cases. No
Why would you want to confess then?
It's the right thing to do
Mr. Asad can I have some details?
We haven't received our rightful 200 million yet. Pakistan and
China, are robbing this country
We will not let this happen
We will show China and Pakistan the consequences of their actions
Every 24 hours, we will kill one of the hostages and send them to
you
So that you may repent
Hello
Have you sent the transport? OK
I wasn't sneaking out, I didn't want to disturb you
Something wrong?
You play with that thing when something is wrong
No nothing is wrong, everything is fine..
The stupid phone rings in the middle of the night
and hubby dear leaves
Yeah it's pretty normal
Itâ€™s normal for a wife not to know about her husband
When will he return?
Is he alright?
Would he even return or... uhh yea..
I guess it happens to everyone. I guess its normal
Heyyy.. I always come back, donâ€™t I?
Because you are lucky so far
Yeah I am lucky, Iâ€™m very lucky!
And you know
Iâ€™m very jealous of this baboon, he gets more attention than I do
Yeah because heâ€™s with me and youâ€™re not
You know, you are lucky she likes you, otherwise I would've kicked
your butt
Hey I have to go, don't worry, I'll be back soon,
Asad, when will you be back?
Damn cockroach
Gentleman we have a hostage situation, they have kidnapped Chinese
engineers...
a hostage is being killed every 24 hours, this is unacceptable
Let's pay them a visit
We are doing HALO. This is your target area
You will flank Tangos from the right and secure the hostages
The choppers will pick you up here
Any questions?
No sir!
C130 leaves in 10 minutes. I want you on the tarmac in 5
Sir
Asad, hurry come here
Are you OK? Do we have to go to the hospital?
No.. not the hospital. Place your hand here!
Not here. . . here
Did you feel something?
Something moved ..
See, he knows you
How do you know it's a he?
I know my baby.. Move your hand
I will have a baby boy
And I will call him Azal..
Azal, Asad
Both names are short and unique
Okay.. But, what if itâ€™s a girl, I will make small ponytails
What will we call her?
you tell me
Arooj..
You OK?
Delta in position
Our demands have not been met
appears you love your money more than your people
Bravo in position
Charlie in position
Alpha in position
Ok go.
Grasshopper come in, over
Go
This is grasshopper, coming in
Grasshopper 30 sec
Cover the Chinese, move them back
Son you will be fine
Hopper 2 coming in
Ok coming, over
We have to take off
Wait wait
Sir how can we leave him?
Shit.. you have to take off
Shit
Wait
See that. There
You... You are really a Pathan
Sir, can I have some first aid please
Assalam o Alaikum sir
All good?
Sir...
How are the boys?
Aa... sir both are hit, they are in the hospital
both are out of danger sir
Good okay
I'll go and see them at CMH
Sir
and one thing more, you should also go to the hospital
Is everything's ok?
Your wife has probably had a fall
Ohh shit
What's with him?
Sir, she was expecting ..
Ok.. go with him
Sir
Asad?
You know I have been thinking
Oh is it 12?
What 's at 12?
You think at 12
you want to listen or donâ€™t you?
Ok ok go on
Husband and wife are like the needles of a clock
Okay
When they get married, they are really close to each other..
But with time, come children, responsibilities, work..
and they start moving away from each other
in the middle age, they are farthest from each other, it's like 6 in
the clock
slowly the responsibilities are over
Children get busy in their own lives, and the old couple drifts back
to each other
like its 12 all over again. I want it to stay 12 all our life
Yeah that's actually pretty nice
But you know, you have some Sikh genes in you
I'll hit you in the head with this bottle
Ah thatâ€™s ok, if you hit a soldier in the head, it's no harm done
Then I will hit your ankle
Hey, not the ankle. That hurts
Hey Seher I can't find my holster
Ohh Asad were you looking for this?
Exactly, what I was looking for. Thank you
Asad how will you live without me?
I won't live without you
Asad?
Hmmm..
Have you ever shot someone?
Uhh see I don't even know how to use this, the max I have done is to
wink at someone
And who did you wink at?
You
Hey don't worry, I just sit behind a table and push a pen
So you relax
Nothing will happen to me
Bye
Take care
And it's the spoon in the box?
Yes
Ok
if you have any problem, just call me
Ok
Haider..
I don't understand.. How will Asad care for such a small child
Oh he will manage . . it's his daughter
But he doesn't know anything about babies
He was asking me, whether she is normal? why are her eyes open?
He thinks that babies open their eyes after a week or so ..
He probably thinks it's a puppy
I thought the same too
A puppy?
Thatâ€™s ridiculous, Haider
Actually, you never get to see a baby that small
Exactly my point Haider, we should have kept her for a while
Right now, being alone is the worst thing for him
Caring for a child will keep him focused
Besides it's not difficult to take care of a baby
Really? In that case you will take care of the next baby
hmm . .. means we should start planning for the next one?
Haider..
Sir, The General is here
Aani, have you had breakfast?
I was in China when I heard the terrible news
I always prayed that your fate be better than mine
But its Allah wills, be strong
Hmmm . .
If the wife is good looking
Then the children are good looking
Thatâ€™s true dad, I wish grandpa had known that too
I am very happy, that you've got your wits about
Would you like to have breakfast dad?
Yes, I am famished
Please have a seat
It's not easy to raise a child alone
You raised a child alone
Yes I did..but there were two major differences
One, you weren't newly born, the other that you were a boy
Women are complicated
Dad there is three of us
You , me, and this lady, we can raise a little girl
Son, I have got time, I will retire soon
How will you manage? How will you find time?
I was thinking Dad that I should apply for an early retirement...
I will have more disposable time
Hmm okay.. But if we both retire what will we do then?
Except security we donâ€™t have a skill
Ahhh thatâ€™s true?
Okay
Make a plan and we will do it ...
I have go now
Dad, at times I wonder
If only we had an intelligence report
About
where Allah keeps all the deceased...
we would carry out a raid, and bring them all back
Yes, that should surprise him. Bring your mom too
Son, always remember .. Man feels no pain. You know that right?
Mom, Dad doesnâ€™t know that you work at someoneâ€™s house .. what if he
finds out?
Your dad is a proud man .. so I donâ€™t want to tell him
But I want to help him in supporting the house
Mom .. I also want to help .. so let me do something too.
Youâ€™re looking after the house .. youâ€™re looking after your sister..
that is a lot of help
Lets talk about this later... I am getting late.... Good Bye
Hey, Shorty where is the General?
Sir, he is waiting outside
Oh okay
Letâ€™s go, letâ€™s go we are getting late
Allah hafiz
Assalam o Alakium dad!
Hahahahha
O Walaikum Assalam
I was just finishing off my cigarette. Canâ€™t smoke in the car
How is my Ujjuu?
Hahahhaa
Whatâ€™s wrong? You havenâ€™t shaved today?
Dad, nobody is looking at me now?
When you are going to take loan from these bankers
You need to wear a suit like them.
Hahaha
Go and wear a suit, Go on
Okay dad
I will finish my cigarette till then
Iâ€™ll be right back
Letâ€™s go little baby, come on
Thatâ€™s too less
should be a little more
Let me see your work first and then maybe you get a raise
Give this to me and then see
Will you make it? Great! Here are the threads and beads
This is the design. Make a copy of this design
Then we will see your work.. okay?
When I am finished ... how do I give this to you?
Our NGOâ€™s office is on the next street
It has a green color board
My name is Bilqis. You can deliver it at the office
Or I will come back after 2 days and I will collect it from you
Please repeat?
Sir, a woman is here for the interview
O okay .. Send her in
Sir, Musa sir is also here
Umm..okay send the woman first and then send Musa
Sir, can I go meet Musa?
Yes, yes go on!
My baby
are you feeling hungry?
Assalam o Alakium sir
How are you, sir?
Heyyy Shorty, how are you?
Very good sir
How are you?
I am great
Howâ€™s everything?
Good sir
Continuing with the job Sir
I will be retiring in a few months
Oh, any plans after retirement?
I havenâ€™t decided anything yet
Do you need men?
Of course I need men . .
the day you retire you have a place waiting
Done?
Yes sir
Okay
Want some tea?
Sure sir
I am missing Sher Shah today..I hope he is okay..
Baba, baba
Mujahidin are here
Mujahidin? How many men?
Four or five of them
Make them sit ..I will be over
Zarmina, Zarmina
Yes, what is it?
Make tea for 4,5 men
OK!
This is a political issue.. itâ€™s a war between the kings for land
and country
I have nothing to do with it
Whether the name of King is Zahir Shah or some Russian..My life
remains the same
Nadir shah, Jihad is our religious duty
Of course it is, but this is politics not religion, our religion has
not been attacked
The Russians are not asking us to abandon our religion and join
theirs
If that happens I will be the first to fight them
If that doesnâ€™t happen, I have no fight with the Russians
Nadir shah, you donâ€™t understand
I understand everything; my children need good food and good life
I donâ€™t need a war
You are free to do as you please in your own area, your own village,
your own country
Sher Shah seemed worried today
He is young, hot blooded and easily influenced
I know someone like that
We will have to leave here
Leave why?
A brutal war is coming ..I canâ€™t bear to see my children being
consumed..
But you said Russians will not harm us, they cant come here?
Yes, but when the forest catches fire, it burns everything in its
way
But where will we go?
Far from this place .. to Karachi
Karachi? ..What will we do there?
We will wait for the war to end
Baba are we going to Karachi?
Probably yes
Is Karachi a good place?
I think it's good...The thing is, there is no war there.
Do they have schools for girls?
I think they do
Can I go to school there?
Of course if things are good, sure you can go
Are there people who will stop me from going to school?
Donâ€™t worry, when I allow you, no one can stop you.
Malalai Run
Sher Shah we are getting late
Sher Shah get in, weâ€™re getting late
No mom you guys go ahead, I have some work here
Sher Shah donâ€™t do this. Let's go
Mom I said I have work ..I will come when I am done.
Baba you go ahead, Goodbye.
I have brought you milk, you must drink it
Mom place it outside, I will be right there
Okay. I am keeping it outside, donâ€™t forget it today.
Dad, you shouldn't have involved yourself in this election business
These people are very vicious
I have talked to him
Walaikumassalam
He will not do anything now...
and nor will he go anywhere...
he will go straight to the school, teach children...
wonâ€™t talk to anyone about politics
wonâ€™t go to the election office ... just come home straight from
school
Dad, you donâ€™t have to listen to anyone
Our country is a mess because of these cowards
they donâ€™t do anything themselves and expect others to do things for
them
how can we expect change without doing do something about it?
How will things be set right?
What can the two of you do? Tell me, what can you do?
You will lose even the two meals you get a day
Mom, you donâ€™t know anything. Just leave it
You don't know anything
You think
the feudal lord will stay quiet?
his men are vicious
He owns the police
and do we have money for the elections?
That must be my rickshaw
Lord, May I go now?
Have you taken anything from here?
No my lord
Hahahahaha
Even if you do, where will you run?
Salam Lord
Be quiet all of you!
Donâ€™t worry, we will win, weâ€™ve already won
We will eat fish, have opium and make more babies
We will win
Lord... we are being humiliated in the area
A school teacher contesting elections against you
We shouldâ€™ve killed him a long time ago
Do not kill him...
If you kill him, who will spread the tales of his misery?
Power must be advertised, not just exercised
Come here
And Listen
Did you make the flag?
Lord... you asked me to make a flag so I made it
Moustache?
Lord, it's symbol of pride for a man
Lord... Lord... we can remove it
But then... what symbol of man do you want on the flag?
You know teacher?
Working women is not a good thing
My daughter is a lawyer
And no country in the world has ever progressed, if half of its
population stays at home
These are the sayings of educated people.
People here are illiterate and ignorant
Narrow minded
Women going out of their homes
These are dangerous times
You sister isnâ€™t home yet.
She isnâ€™t?
No...
Where is Dad?
He is gone to look for her
She has never been this late. I hope she is OK
Please donâ€™t worry
I have a bad feeling about this, my heart is sinking
Dad... where is Ayesha?
Where is she... where is my daughter?.. Where is she??
Why arenâ€™t you answering? Tell me, answer me
She isnâ€™t there
She isnâ€™t?
No
I asked her colleague, he told me that she left on time
Have you asked the rickshaw driver?
Yes I asked him. He said that he waited for her but Ayesha didnâ€™t
show up
The Lordâ€™s men... The Lordâ€™s men have taken her
Oh God! My poor girl?
Move over... I will ask the rickshaw driver myself
Letâ€™s go to the police station
What good will going to the police do? The SHO is Lordâ€™s slave
Whatever the rickshaw driver says, we will have to go to the police
Going to the Police will be so scandalous? Don't you know that?
I am sure she will be back in a while..
Oh, my daughter!!!
Come on lets go, we are going to the police
Why donâ€™t you talk straight, teacher?
She is young..
she is pretty ...
she is educated ..
She has gone off with someone with consent
Has she expressed her interest in anyone?
You know whatâ€™s going on!!
besides Rajab came to our house in the morning
Musa khan...
Yes sir?
she has an interest in Rajab?
Hold your tongue
Son of a *****...
Donâ€™t you have any manners?
I will beat the crap out of you
If she has eloped with someone, is it my fault?
You are recklessly accusing a noble man without a reason..
I have understood everything
Your sister had an affair with someone
you have killed her for honour
And now I will investigate this
SHO sir... please donâ€™t bother... we will look for her ourselves

In the whole wide world you have given us Pakistan
You think you are GOD??
You are beautiful..

Sir she is innocent and naive..
She hasn't done anything
Please let my daughter go free
Let her go free?
Teacher Iâ€™m treating you with respect ..
what are you saying?
Are you accusing me of something?
I know we are political rivals ..
but accusing me to win an election is so unfair
Sir, my wife won't be able to bear it, she will die..
Sir I beg of you, for God sake..
for the sake of the Holly Prophet...
What is happening here?
are the women of the area not safe?
What is the Police Officer doing?

Why you won't say something??
Why are you quite?
Where is my Ayesha?
Where is my Ahsan?
Why are the mosques announcing this?

Why donâ€™t you say something?
My kids..
My Ashan

Why won't you speak?
Where are my kids? Where are they?
Lord.. May I come in?
Come in Ghungru come in
They came to me earlier
His son was being aggressive ..

When we find the body of the sister we will charge the brother with
murder
You are getting smart Ghungru..

Tell me...
What makes you think that you will find the girl's body?
I have served you long enough, sir.
She is gone.. my daughter is gone
she left me..
Allah.. How many times did I tell you?
I told you that no one stands with truth
Liars .. everyone is a liar
Cowards and meek
The honest can never win here ..
Look, they silenced you..
Silenced my daughter... Oh God silenced my daughter...
I told you... I told you...
But you wouldn't listen
My daughter is gone now.. sheâ€™s gone forever
She's gone. What do I do?
Murderers... Murderers...
Asma!
Asma control yourself
Asma .. Asma come to your senses

Oh and Teacher
When you bury your daughter and your wife..
Bury your son too ..
I'm dead to you
Baba..
Do you think you can win the elections without us?
It's difficult this time
Then ..?
Who are you?
Do you want to enjoy the fruit or ...
or not enjoy the fruit?
Umm OK
OK
then let us meet after the elections..
OK
Sir, there's a huge crowd outside
I'll talk to them right after this call
Get ready to be the Chief Minister
Mend fences with the enemies and throw crumbs to the greedy ..
Sure sure. Allah Hafiz
Allah Hafiz
We need clear majority
how do we get it?
Same as always, use money
use human greed for power
I can arrange all this but on two conditions ...
Your party must support me all the way ..
and
Mr. Imtiaz Ijaz... will be the CM..
Mr. Imtiaz Ejaz will be the CM..
but will you be able to do this?
I exist to serve ..
Sir, tomorrow you will join this party
What's in it for me?
Sir, you have already been rewarded
Without us you would not have won the elections
if you have any doubt on this
we can always hold election again for your seat
A simple complaint to the election commission..
and the person who stamped all fictitious votes for you will confess
..
But
if you hold your end of the bargain.. you will win the next
elections too
and if you don't ...
You will not only lose your seat now..
but will also face the consequences of backing out ..
Tomorrow eh?
you watch too many movies ..
He becomes MPA and is drinking juice ..
How stupid ..
In the whole wide world you have given us Pakistan
Who gave you this?
A man came over and said its very important that you see it ..
you should not take things from people you donâ€™t know.. Open it
Wait wait
Leave ..
Zara..
Yes papa?
What is the problem? Have you spoken to Imtiaz..
what is wrong?
I have spoken to him.. but he won't listen
He has simply refused to be the CM..
What do we do now?
We will have to look for a new candidate for CM
someone who is acceptable to all
We have only four days
You have confessed to a murder you did not commit and you are saying
this is the best option?
Baba the police and the court are under their control ..
We have no hope here
Everyone is afraid of them
even the lawyers won't take our case..
we need to get out from this area ..
we have to get to a higher forum before we are heard ..
I will be loyal to
and will always support Pakistan
And I
as a
Chief Minister
Will discharge my duties with
Honesty
utmost intelligence
and diligence
That I
will perform
my official duties by
being impartial to all people
without any fear
without favor or hatred
in accordance to the law
and will provide justice to all
You had everything . . why did you back off?
even if I wanted to, I couldnâ€™t tell you..
But I can tell
who is responsible for this..
Who?
The one who benefits the most
Benefits the most?
Him?
Poor guy will be a martyr
This is not fair. The hands that work, canâ€™t afford the produce
You are right. The hands that work have a certain right to the
produce
You have worked harder than me, you take it
I will take it next time, this is yours
I have to go and get some money for home
Heyy gorgeous, what's the hurry?
What is your name hoty..
Talk to me, where are going?
Hey, she's mine
Zarmeena... Zarmeena...
God, where the hell is she?
Zameena..
She is slow..
I swear..
I know..
Yes sir
I told you like 30 minutes ago to get me glass of milk..
Do you not understand.. get me glass of..
Can you please translate?
Milk.. milk..
He wants milk, milk okay
Woman, do you get it? Milk
Go get it
Oh okay, I'll just get it..
Can you help me get home Please?
My home is very near
Just help me cross these people
Thanks
The Police does not collect evidence and the people don't testify
We are all responsible for this state of affairs
What do I do?
everybody is sympathetic
everyone knows
I am telling the truth
but nobody is doing anything to help
because they can't do anything
Look, as long as he is the CM
you cannot do anything, about him or his men
I have a piece of land, if I sell it, I can pay your fee
paying my fees won't solve your problem
Once the snake winds itself around a prey the only way to break the
grip is to cut off the snake head
We have to cut off the head
Sir, you are away from the bull
See that?
That's his firing pattern
Double tap to the throat
Are we to bring the man down or score points?
Salam o Alaikum
Umm.. If you have to go to the NGO, I can take you there..
Day after tomorrow
Oh but..
I won't be there day after tomorrow..
Friday? I will be here on Friday?
Are you insane? What if someone sees you here?
Go from here.. Go..
You want to eat this?
Bhabi , feeding her is tricky. Let me try. . .
Youâ€™ll get tired..
Asadbhai, nobody gets tired of feeding a child
Control to Raven over
Raven clear
Sir, kindly, come on a landline phone
Okay... excuse me
Bhai have you decided anything?
About what Bhabhi?
AsadBhai..
AsadBhai..You have a long life ahead of you... how will u manage it?
Bhabi... I canâ€™t go through all of it all over again
All ok?
There was an attack on the CM
Is he okay?
Yes he is safe..
but security guards were killed
You incompetent idiots
stupid .. useless
all you can do is harass the poor villagers..
you are just pimps and boot leggers?
If I rely on you all my hard work will be destroyed
you... I want the security that is available to the President
Sir, that is available only to the Federal government, Provincial
officials cannot have it..
Hmmm...? I am the Chief Minister...
I want that security!
Sir, some people are here regarding the security proposals that we
invited
Hmm... are they any good?
He is a retired general of the Special Forces sir...
Call them . .
they have certain requirements first
What is this?
Sir, they need licenses for certain weapons
They also need some equipment
And sir..
they want to install CCTV cameras all over the CM house
Not possible..
Exactly my point Sir
your new suite.. And your office
Sensitive matters of government happen there... that should not be
recorded..
Cameras will not be installed ..
Call them in
Yes sir
Assalam o Alaikum
Walaikumassalam..
My son Asad..
Are you sure
you can protect me?
We are Special Forces sir
we are the best in the world
What will you charge?
We are expensive Sir
Reason?
We think your life is very precious..
what do you think?
Haha
I like your answer
1-year agreement... 3 months probation
Alright, sir... you have the requirements
There will be slight changes but..you will get the approvals
Thank you
Hey Asad... I donâ€™t have a good feeling about this..
Why Dad?
This is a very taxing job and will have a lot of conflict
are we doing the right thing protecting this feudal
Dad..They are all feudal.. Besides they are the choice of the people
Look at it this way, itâ€™s good money..
Itâ€™s a high profile contract..we get our choice of equipment..
and we are professionals.. This is what we do
we are not concerned with politics..
Everybody is concerned with politics
we are not mercenaries
it's our own land
Anyway... you carry on
Iâ€™m taking Arooj home..Letâ€™s go
I am not Ramzan... my name is Nadir Shah
Oh..I must be mistaken..
Where does Mr. Ramzan live in this area?
May be in some other area... I donâ€™t know
Oh okay.. Thank you
Excuse me sir
Please place all your metal objects here
Here? In front of everyone?
Sir, put all your metal objects here
I am your CMâ€™s right hand
If you cooperate with me, I will get you promoted
Please sir, I am requesting you
I just told you.. No one orders Rajjab around ...
Leave me, I will have you dismissed
Major, my orders did not mean that you start beating my people
Apologize to him
Sir your orders are that nobody can bring in weapons
in future, if you want him to bring in weapons, we will allow him
presentlywe have followed your orders Sir
I will think about this and let you know..
Thank you
Yes, sir...
she hit you here?
Sayien...
It hurts
You were beaten by a girl?
Lord, she is not an ordinary girl... she is strong as an Ox
when you wear pants and shirts, you become sissy
Hey, how are you?
Haven't seen you in many days
You look upset?
Was it your father, the other day?
Where the hell have you been?
You havenâ€™t been to work for 3 days..
Do own the city?
I am not feeling well
I have high fever
Eh.. Itâ€™s good that you have fever..you are hot
Be at your place at 7 in the evening
Or I will rearrange your face
Letâ€™s go

Money doesnâ€™t grow on trees.. You will have to earn it
Lets go
How much?
How much is this for?
60..
Make it forty my friend
Sayien .
Sayien . Lord..The same police officer has taken a girl, there will
be problems, it is a business of 5 million a month..
we have worked hard to set this up and have brought the girls from
far and wide
Calm JJ down..and call the IG of police
The boy..Ahsan..
We have started communicating with him
I have thought of something..
What?
The smaller the chain
and the sooner its broken the better
Yes, but
If he
doesnâ€™t return to the jail.. then..
it will be a problem ..
Did we get him out of Jail?
No
Then it is the problem of Jail authorities
Huh.. Okay..
So is it that easy to get out of here?
and kill him?
I just told you
I can help you
and you were in the jail.. how could you kill anybody?
can you get me out of here?
Yea..
this is very common here.. We do it all the time
Uhmm..But how will I kill such a powerful man?
A Bullet goes through everybody
We will give you the plan
But why?
Because you are dear to me..
And even if youâ€™re not, he is our enemy
Why donâ€™t you do this yourself?
We are doing it ourselves
you are just playing your small part
we are doing the rest
The feudal lord is coming for a meeting tomorrow
and he will have a press conference there
I will be PTVâ€™s cameraman
This is your card
You will be the audio recorder
this is your microphone with which you record him
Aha...do not press the button
there is a pen pistol inside . . with only 1 bullet... when you take
his interview
You can't miss, its straight in the face
What if real PTV reporters come?
Donâ€™t worry we have taken care of it. They wonâ€™t come
Does the power go off at this time daily?
don't know... there isn't a fixed time
It comes and goes as it pleases
I donâ€™t understand where the country is heading? What is our future?
We are
waiting for someone.
someone who will come and
fix everything for us
Who will come?
No one will
How did you.....?
I got bailed Baba
Bailed out??
Yes
How?
Who bailed you out? Who was the lawyer?
When was the court hearing?
One of my close friends hired a lawyer
Which friend?
I met him in the jail
Anyway Baba
Donâ€™t worry
Everything will be fine
Itâ€™s not that simple son
But Baba... nothing lasts forever
not even people
The Feudal won't live either
Anyway,
I am going to sleep. Ok?
A society where people take the law in their own hands, cannot
survive
If you donâ€™t like the law, you can change it
But you cannot take the law in your own hands
I have stood for this principle all my life and I will not
back off now
even if I have to lose my last hold . . my son
Mr. Mohsin
you will remain in custody till we figure this out..
I am ready to be
wherever you ask me to..
I have one request though
My son is not a bad person
He is acting emotionally
please save him
He is my last hope.
SS come in
Lord... my son has been kidnapped...
The kidnappers want 80 million rupees
Chchchch... I feel so sorry for my country. Where are we headed?
Paliwala
I can tell the police...
They are lazy, incompetent, recruited under undue influence, not
merit
I donâ€™t know what they will do?...
Yours son's life is in danger
The other option is that I involve myself personally
Yes Lord
Hmmm... arrange the money
I will find out who is behind this
Lord... I can pay only 30 Million, I donâ€™t have any more
Hello
My dearest friend
Mr. Paliwala, Lord..
Mr. Paliwala...
someone has kidnapped his son
find out who has him
he will bring 50 million tomorrow
after taking the 50 million, should I let the kid go?
You informed against me?
If it wasn't for you Father
you wouldâ€™ve been dead by now
yourcompanion had planned to kill you after the task.
I donâ€™t care about myself anymore
I have just one desire..to bring that man down.. That's it
Son, you do not understand
There is a way of doing things..
The law still exists
Dad, you donâ€™t understand
There is no law here
you are again following the nonexistent law
Didn't the feudal lord kill our Ayesha?
Hasnâ€™t Rajjab killed so many?
Doesnâ€™t everybody know the reality?
Then what should we do? Wait for our turns?
Son.. Nobody testifys
Who will testify now?
What should I do?
Should I die?
You will go back to jail. We will look into this..
and if you are telling the truth, you will get everything
witnesses
lawyers....
and justice
Sir...
Nothing will happen here
Yes it will
after that.. we killed the Teacher's daughter and threw her body in
the canal
she was a nice girl
but what could I do?
The SHO knew everything.
He implicated the teachers son in the murder
but what could he do? It wasSayien'sdesire
Lord.. I have my own my daughters..
how can I harm my own daughters for the sake of others
Who will save me? Who will help me?
This police...
or these courts...
no one will save me
I have to help myself
He is...
like me...
a captive of this system
System... ???
the other 120 million people are not doing this...
just these few thousand?
they use the system as an excuse
What should I do? Set him free?
Ask him to confess, he must say all this in front of the police and
the the courts
Ok
Announce your verdict.
You have 15 days
Within these 15 days, you have to confess all your crimes to the
police
And if you don't..
I think it was a secret agency or something
God knows who all exist in this country
What is this Major?
Ah... I donâ€™t know sir but he is not our security responsibility
From now on he is
You will now provide security to him too
Ah..ok Sir.
but we will not extend support against government agencies
or in any illegal activity
Then what is the use of hiring you?
Sir, we are a company, we operate under the law of the land
we are not mercenaries
So the wolf took a sheep..at night the shepherd realized that one
sheep was missing
next day the shepherd was very careful, but the wolf was yet able to
take another sheep
the shepherd was worried so he came up with plan
next day the shepherd himself wore a sheepâ€™s skin and waited
When the wolf camethe shepherd, understood and killed the wolf.
Moral of the story, sometimes to get your enemy, you must look
harmless to the enemy
Assalam u Laikam
Sit down, Sit down

You are not paying me enough.
Sayien, There isnt much in it.
But yes if I get that 500 flat scheme too...

I will not give that project to you
People will die because of your construction
Uhh... sir, Pakistan has a big population
It leads to scandals
Sir there are no earthquakes here. .
the buildings will be fine for the next 8 to10 years
God knows, where you and I will be, in 10 years...
and even if a few thousand people die . . so what?
Hmm... Hmm...

Sir, there is a maid in our house, I think she is her daughter
I have seen her for the first time, sir
Get lost from here
But remember this, I will deduct the entire dayâ€™s salary
Let me take you to the hospital..
No son, we will go ourselves
Uh... donâ€™t be sacred, I will get a rickshaw for you

Mom this is the same guy who met baba, we can go with him
Lets go
No no, Iâ€™ll do it
Come, have a seat
Lord, is everything all right? You are very quiet today
I donâ€™t feel so good
Are you okay, Lord?
I donâ€™t want these woman now

Lord, that is a good thing..
Good choice..
You know my friend, the Builder ...
Yes Lord..
A woman works there... her daughter is...

She will be here at your feet, tomorrow
All you have to do is order me
I just did.. Didnâ€™t I?
Itâ€™s done then, Sayien, itâ€™s done!
Hmmm...

I was left alone with my little children, when my husband passed
away
It was my husbandâ€™s home
I have worked hard as a widow
Gave my Children good education
sometime ago
Some people started buying the area
They told us that they will build a plaza here
I didnâ€™t want to sell
When I questioned them
They beat up my sons badly
They threatened us
And I was so scared
I was kicked out of my own house
I went to the police
but nothing happened
I didnâ€™t have the money to go to the court
I went to the media..
They kidnapped my son
Sir, itâ€™s been fifteen days
I haven't seen my son
I want my son, sir
