NOVEMBER 1992
That Guy is weird. It is in all.
Achei You were friends. It's quiet.
He has no friends.
They need some stop?
No, thank you. Already in hand.
Police filled a madness!
And the drug traffickers preparing the vans.
Once I was in that awesome party...
It's all right?
We were looking for you.
Come on?
Ouve.
- What?
The silence.
I thought you were talking about the birds.
I will draw it later.
Finally!
Where were you?
I walked away, but could not.
I was very ill.
I think had taken the boat.
Hi.
You touched a cool thing. What was?
It was a joyous thing, a soft melody.
As a hoot.
Small flutes, small sounds.
Ah, you are.
PARADISE GARAGE
He promoted, in September, "Ã‰dition limit"
one of the best raves already organized in Paris.
Radio FG. The techno radio, 24 hours a day.

It Exaggerated...
- What is exaggerated?
Where are you going?
- Mandar A letter.
... A para linha has Boissy-Saint-LÃ©ger...
Nadia saw that his friend is there?
I saw. That sucks.
She's not my friend.
Why you do not talk to Serge?
- Nothing to see.
It's all right?
- It's all right.
Hello.
- It's all right?
It's all right?
- All, And you?
Who are they?
Thomas and Guy-Man? They make music.
They spend the night making sound with a bizarre machines.
They have a band, Darlin '.
It is a naughty Happy Days in techno version.
They are very talented. Their sound is new.
is Enjoying it?
- Much.
I did not think we were going to hear a garage rave.
Gostam The garage?
- Yup.
Buy the fanzine.
It has an interview with Frankie Knuckles.
Do you like this music?
It is rare to find garage fans in Paris.
We love the mix of machines with voice.
The robotic electronic music with the warmth of the soul.
Hot and cold.
- It's A good description.
Perhaps you are the DJs of the future.
We are thinking about forming a double.
I will buy three. How many numbers have already left?
We are in the fifth. But doing so takes time.
Work on radio FG. Spend there to see me.
Are not you the girl?
What girl?
That hat cat.
Who?
- That Half Arab.
Ah, now I remembered.
Wonderful. He took the number?
Got crazy? You were with her.
Really?
You were kissing for 10 minutes.
Is not true.
- Really.
What the fuck! I'm going after it.
Help me?
- Of course.
We need a name for our double.
One thing we take.
3 YEARS AFTER JANUARY 1995
What do you think?
Do not you think the middle retro?
No, it's perfect.
And Cheers is pretty cool.
It's the new Kerri Chandler? Promotional drive? How lucky.
We need to buy more disks.
Do not draw on my Polaroids. Blew it!
I'm sublimating. It's art. 'This is not art.
No Need to cry.
- Look What he did?
What the fuck! Yeah, what the fuck!
And This ink does not come out!
- It's A marker.
Very ugly!
- Very beautiful!
You know Polaroids costly?
Cyril is like a child. Ruins everything that takes.
Hello.
- Hello.
Can I ask a favor?
You can take notes of the piano in this passage?
Did you see the "Le Monde"?
- No, why?
There was an article on ecstasy.
I'm starving.
I cut out for you.
"Scientific studies show a degeneration of nerve cells
which can cause degenerative diseases
or depression on consumers.
While some suffer from insomnia,
some will become seriously ill and others may even die."
'You take this party?
- No.
Much of their neurons must have fried.
You need to let this nonsense and concentrate on his studies.
Has that great teacher who loves you.
She got mad.
The Thesis is advancing? Yes, since I started writing.
Will not turn a DG, I hope.
DJ is not DG.
It is the letter J in English.
Abreviatura de "disk jockey".
DG, DJ... I see no difference.
Many DJs are making money.
Are you homosexual?
- MamÃ£e, That's enough!
All that remains to be gay and get AIDS.
You never show me their girlfriends.
I think I present?
- Consegui!
It's difficult to maintain a relationship.
We've been listening to music, nothing else matters.
You do not understand it.
It gets stuck to their shitty prejudices.
I do not know why Ilan waste time. You treat the bad guy.
He spoke to who hates when he touches you.
He said that?
I said this during sleep. Why he does not fall off?
And you, why? Are masochists?
And you are a psychopath! Nobody sleeps with you.
Get a girlfriend, do not insult the other!
Where's your American? She never appears.
He is tied to his radiator.
I'm in love. Someone can steal it.
David! These are Paul and Stan, the DJs of Cheers.
David Serrano. Cheers - Why?
Paul was traveling from ecstasy. Do not try to understand.
They are creating a seal and wanted some advice.
My pleasure.
Julia, I'm me! Paul!
- My God!
no Mean to scare you.
- Quis, Yes!
I thought you were my husband.
You did not see that I was here? Not seen my purse?
No! My God...
I have nightmares that he will return.
Never do that again!

You think so?
It's Kind of weird.

She has a beautiful voice.
It is good to dance, but do not know if would be listening at home.
I would stay. Anyway...
You prefer to listen to Leonard Cohen until doomsday.
Oh no! My moderninho student...
You will miss me?
Much.
- So Do not go.
I can not be a waitress forever, I need a real job.
No need. Forget NY, nobody lives there.
Paris is much more fun. It is the place of the moment.
You will be a writer, I'll be a DJ.
We'll be rich.
Please stay.
This must end one day.
"La dolce vita" is over.
- Do not say that.
This is just the beginning.
Please stay. I love you.

Our separation scares me.
I did not want to be taking me.
The last few days have been difficult for me.
So long, my little French.

What do you mean, over?
- Acabou, He failed.
You're lucky with Louise.
Caro Paul VallÃ©e,
Two years ago I said you had talent as a writer.
Enthusiastic, accepted guide your thesis,
despite my busy schedule.
His questions seemed legitimate.
However, after numerous efforts
to help you overcome your inhibitions,
and after your little attendance, with two months of silence,
I realize that literature has no place in your life.
I do not hide my disappointment,
equivalent to the expectations that I had...
Think is the solution? It's his father's inheritance.
It briefly. Logo will get money.
So let each francs in savings,
so it is open.
If you do not mind, I prefer to close the account.
I can reopen when things improve.
You know.
How are the parties in the King?
- Ã"timas.
Maybe I go one night.
- Boto You on the list.
Why not?
"Showgirls". A masterpiece.
Too bad!
- A Shit!
Rather than "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
It can run for Worst Actress in the World.
She won a Razzie.
- What is this?
Negative Oscar.
Acharam A bit exaggerated?
- A Little bit, yeah.
It is on purpose.
Verhoeven directed as well to emphasize the sight of her.
He wanted a grotesque thing.
- Deu Right.
The American vulgarity was the target.
It's the third time and you still do not understand!
Time for a change, right?
Takes advantage of us to show shit.
It is not shit, it's a masterpiece.
It's a classic '90s.
I have an intermediate opinion.
Critics were wrong.
It is a Verhoeven. But it is not the best.
Sucks! They are crazy.
I'm wasting time with this shit, Arnaud.
Cyril, no one forced you.
He needs a girlfriend.
He rejects all the girls.
It's a misogynist first.
It's a fagot, you're done.
It's right here, sir.
Thank you.
I Just interviewing Nile Rodgers.
- How cool.
You know what he said?
It was the best interview of his life.
Really? If you realize?
Nile Rodgers? He is God!
Cyril did not come?
Not answering the phone.
That sucks.
It's all right?
It's all right?
- Yup.
And you?
We forgot that we will get on a plane?
Can go, I will not.
This is absurd.

You can not say that.
I wanted to come because I need you.
If you are not, I feel sad.

Uns 200-200?
No Were 200.
- At least 150.
Are fans from the start. We could not charge.
But 60% for free is not possible.
Including the dancers.
By the way, let's talk about them.
They are as important as the music.
It's great to come, but not every dancer from Paris.
In addition, they spread too much.
They are discreet. They do not bother anyone.
This is not to stop, but this can be problematic.
And we could improve some things, including music.
What you mean?
Tonight was cool, full of people.
But I go, I hear things, I note.
Note that payers are decreasing.
From the beginning you do garage.
They are faithful, that's good, is honored.
But perhaps they should do a more modern thing.
You do not change but people change.
I'm not suggesting David Gueta.
They know the lesbian club, Pulp?
Touch electro. Always auction.
They do not like electro?
I'm going to walk back.
To your home? In this weather?
With this coat?
Is not it time to catch flu.
I'm no cash.
- I have. Enter.
You know what I have in the account? Anything.
Sorry, I'm tough.
What if I can not give a check, going to live on the street?
We have many expenses.
Singers, equipment, studio...
Not to mention the seal. But it is an investment.
I'm beginning to doubt.
I wish you could find a good girl.
And it will not be in the clubs.
Geraldine will defend his thesis.
He could come and meet her friends.
They are different from yours.
Up Seems.
- And why not?
I will not watch the thesis Geraldine.
I do not understand this prejudice against intellectuals.
Asshole.
At least not if drugs.
It seems the invasion of Poland.
We have heard 250. Choose one.
It's a decision the two, you know?
Let's hear some new: 23, 62...
No, too heavy.
- Pesada?
62.
A fart rabbit.
Put 29. I think I liked it.
Not very feminine.
Women? I like.
I know what you mean.
Very light, superficial.
Petty, right?
Put 13. I think it was good.
Hi, Paulzinho! Let's get out today? We are hot like an ember.

I turned expert in funeral affairs.
It was an exhibition of funerary products.
Paradise gravediggers, you know?
Burials, cremations, marble gravestones...
Era super interessante.
But today I was finished. Barely slept all week.
From Who is to blame?
- Yeah.
I had a stand with open coffins.
Some was a luxury only!
Silk interior, upholstered...
I decided to lie down and sleep in one of them.
That crazy.
Minhas Colleagues said that.
- And You did not believe?
Come dance, intellectuals!
No, thanks.
That sucks!
Excuse!
I'm sorry. Bye.
The Burguesinha is well loose.
More Than in Cheers.
- In Cheers it is over.
And it is not bourgeois.
Only in appearance.
Your soul is proletarian.
And I like vegetables.
And work out at the gym.
Sorry, I have to charge.
His idiocy makes me cough.
Damn, she asked for more.
Two bottles were not enough.
Let me see.
She thinks you're Puff Daddy.
How you will pay?
Good evening.
He promised you would not do anything.
I can not resist.
Paul!
It's all right.
I need someone to give me security.
You do not give me security.

You give up easy.

Will come to nothing.
What are you doing?
- I'm going for a walk.
At five in the morning?
Yes, I go for a walk at five in the morning.
SEPTEMBER 2008
Do you miss Paris?
I was never very Parisian.
We were lucky to find your balance leaving the past behind.
I also think about it.
No longer wants to be a DJ?
I do not want to do it all your life.
And the girl who drives you crazy?
Margot?
- Ended?
I spent three years trying to sleep with her and did not happen.
Now she is with David Castor, DJ VIP Room in St-Tropez.
She drove me crazy. I could have killed.
And I could have killed me?
You well he deserved.
But when I saw what you fabricated, it would have been a shame.
In 15 years, Charlotte will have 19.
Instead of the mother, can I marry her daughter.
Find another line of work.
She will not want an outdated DJ.
Outdated? It was cool.
But perhaps you are right.
This shell is alive?
Is alive?
Let's see a notary and sign the sale papers.
You give 10%.
We do a clause on the approval of the loan, etc.

It could be considered that we are not Bill Gates.
She has made sacrifices.
Lowered its price, traveled in business class..
Where are they? Over there.
The Junior Executive Suite does not communicate with Junior.
But the Junior Suite communicates with the Suite Parisian.
And that Parisian is more expensive?
It's bigger. The Executive expense 1.500.
The Parisian expense 3.500.
Azar. She returns to Chicago without singing.

Peace on earth to men of good will, they say.

Robert Creeley.
I know and like very much.
A poem there reminded me of you.
I put an X next to the title.
They're waiting for me. Bye.
Everything is a rhythm,
door that closes the window that opens,
seasons, sunlight,
the moon, the oceans, the growth of things,
individual people's minds,
recurring in all of them,
think that the end is not the end,
the time you return,
themselves dead but someone else coming.
If the death'm dead,
in life I will also dying, dying...
And women cry and die.
Children only grow to become old.
The dry grass, strength is gone.
But comes another, turning,
oh, not mine, not mine,
and in turn dies.
The pace designing continuity,
doubling all of its strength,
the door window,
from ceiling to floor,
illuminated at the beginning,
dark at the end.
