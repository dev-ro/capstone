New train with sleeping berth...
Paris to Mont-Blanc.
Paris to Nice.
<Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye> by Horace McCoy
"Such as happiness".
If he is seeking it.
"I'm seeking, too".
"Or honor".
"That's for him".
"If he doesn't want it".
"I don't want either".
"I'm satisfied with it"
"I'm satisfied with it"
"That silent man"
"Is the same as me".
"His desire is also mine".
Your whisky, sir
Just put it here.
Do you need a towel?
Excuse me.
What's population of Atlantic City?
Maybe 63000, at least 62500.
Traffic control is strict at weekends.
So is Paris.
The Communist Party was at
this street last year.
They lost in local election?
Yes. They always oppose people to bathe.
Thanks.
You're so beautiful, Miss Nelson.
Who are you?
May I coming in?
Why?
I want to have a talk with you.
Talk about what?
Corridor is not the right place.
Any thing you want to say?
Is this the habit you got in the Maroc War?
War?
The war is over for a long time.
Yes, it's over.
It's over? Trafalgar, Sedan.
Le Chemin des Dames,
Mers El Kebir, Leningrad.
Okinawa, Berlin, Hanoi.
Only the battlefield changed.
As to evidence...
How can any evidence found there?
Right, what are you doing here?
Stupid,
Boring guy.
So, what do you want to talk to me?
How did Richard die?
Was that really a heart paralysis?
How could I know?
I know it from the newspaper just now.
And I'm immediately here.
Immediately?
You have been to the site, haven't you?
Me?
Mr. Typhus
Hurry up with your words.
I rushed here this morning, and
my shoes are in a mess.
My train arrived here at 8:13.
And I walked here from the station.
I saw you enter the hotel
So I decided to live next to you.
All I want is just a talk with you.
And we work together like before.
It was him who worked with you, not me.
Yes, the "work" you just said
Is for what?
We have the same goal.
I don't understand what
you are talking about.
Come on, Paula
You must have seen a few clues from me.
Maybe you are right.
I got the telegram 3 days ago, and
I managed to get here yesterday.
I feel the distance between us is getting longer.
I don't know whether I still love him.
But I still feel I should come here.
I got to his home
But hear only that he had been
taken to the hospital of the fifth area.
Yes, newspapers said he had
been buried for a long time.
That's why I got nothing at the hospital.
Tell me something that I don't know.
That's a secret.
Secret?
Don't pretend you don't know the fact.
So what can a woman like me do?
There's a serious rebellion in Paris.
The Information Bureau, the
Department of Interior
The government is shaking.
Does the situation really so serious?
Yes, extremely serious.
We work together and halve the money.
How is it?
OK, let's do it.
Which shoes fit my close?
White or Blue?
The blue pair.
Now, nihility exceeds reality.
Now, we are in the world of
bloods and mysteries.
Just like
those Walt Disney films by
Humphrey Bogart,
And they're political films.
Doctor Corvo is the coroner.
Is that uncle Edgar?
How's he going?
Are you his nephew?
Come on, I'm not invisible.
Is he dead?
No.
Have a talk?
What are you going to say
to the police?
Relax, I'll say nothing.
You are...?
David Goodis.
And who's this girl?
My girlfriend
Doris Mizoguchi.
She's now living in Paris, and is
entertained by her uncle.
How long have she lived in Paris?
Exactly?
Yes, exactly.
So, how long have she stayed here?
Exactly?
Yes, exactly.
Exactly,
It's 127 years.
Interesting answer.
You don't see her often?
She lived too far away,
how can I see her everyday?
Only the lunch and dinner time, as well as
when drinking the afternoon tea
And also the time between afternoon
tea and dinner, or after the dinner.
We meet at cinema or theater.
As you know she lives in Levallois
but I live in Paris.
Fortunately it's Paris not France.
The visa makes her no trouble
when coming to see me.
Can't you go to see her?
Yes, I can, but only times
except dinner and afternoon tea.
You jerk.
How can a jerk speak French?
What are you doing at the street?
"I'm stuck in the mirror".
"It's so real, like an angle. "
"It's different from the
so-called mirror image. "
What's that?
An unaccomplished novel.
The title is "Unfinished Story"
"This actress"
"Is a girl with deep pupil,
just like bouquet. "
"That Japanese girl suddenly
has a similar expression as I do. "
"Maybe she is just tired of
conversations as I do. "
"But what the girl says is
just normal words. "
"It's nothing but silent around. "
"I don't know what the day is. "
"I can only tell other people the
feelings of this endless pain"
"Who will believe us?"
"Who will believe the world?"
"I love the girl who has gone. "
"And I'm just a paint brush,
which colors the time. "
"She keeps speaking. "
"And I keep listening. "
"That makes me feel like dreaming. "
"The girl is like a gate to an
unknown world. "
"The girl often wins victories
that can never be exceeded. "
"Do you still remember
the song she chanted?"
I can't find a rhyme for my writing.
If Lewis Carroll brings you to
Alice's Wonderland
You may be able to find it.
I just can't. Would you help me?
OK. And I need your help, too.
Remember to keep silent to the police.
What does he do?
He is an assistant.
When police ask you,
just say "I disappeared".
44th in Jean Jaures Street.
The dead man is this Richard.
Oh, God.
What a sarcastic tragedy!
I'll undertake my last task.
<Larousse Gastronomique>
That is because I dyed my hair.
Dr. Corvo didn't see me trough.
Don't be so discouraging. Cheer up!
Is that interesting?
That's interesting.
Hey, uncle.
Yes, sir.
Sir, next time please call me
bartender Paul.
I'm not that old.
May I ask for another one?
Right away.
Remember, I'm bartender Paul.
Not uncle.
Then how old are you? I'm 22.
Add a pair of twos on that.
Add 2 and 2 are 26.
She is wrong, bartender Paul.
Add 22. It's 44.
You are good at mental calculation,
and her French is excellent.
But she has made a funny mistake.
You are just 19. That's incredible.
The years between 22 and 35
are my favorite time.
I don't want to be 19.
Unfortunately there's no war.
If there was,
It's between 14 and 70 years old.
You must want to be a 40 years old man.
Since you are so good at calculation,
I got something to ask you.
That's OK.
Count how many things are there in the bar.
In the bar?
The bar I mean is
The rooms where
All the guests
Are together and enjoying
their drinks.
That's to say, the rooms
where I, bartender Paul,
Fill wines for guests.
A bar is a bar like,
And woman is a woman like.
Don't get it too complex.
Is that too difficult for you?
Come on; count how many
things are there.
A drinking glass
And many bottles, and a bundle of rose
And some windows on my right
A door in front of me, and
another behind you
You see, even at the same time
Things are in different places.
Go on counting.
A bartender
Where is he?
Isn't he in face of me?
Is he? I don't see him.
Go on counting.
An ashtray
A serving tray
A coffee pot with three mouths
1 cigarette, 1checked jacket.
Walls surround the bar.
A bed and a worker, and...
Don't know how to get rid of
this kind of boring Paula
You are talky. You should not
be born at this time.
What are you angering at?
Bartender Paul
You make your life by talk?
That's a necessary skill.
Oh, that's reasonable.
Although I actually don't like,
I want to try to write poetry.
Why don't you like it?
I think poetry is a pile of nonsense.
That's the definition in the dictionary.
The dictionary do has this.
Poetry is a pile of words
Which makes a perfect meaning.
I'm sorry that's wrong, absolutely.
What's wrong with her definition?
Poetry makes meaning, but not perfect one.
Just boring paronomasia.
You'd better not try to write poetry.
Let's drink.
Do you want a try, bartender Paul?
The glass is not in the wine.
The bartender is in the
pocket of the pencil.
The counter kicks her feet.
The bed extinguishes a cigarette.
The desk stands on the top of the glass.
The ceiling is hung on the light.
The window stares her in the eyes.
She opens her eyes and sees the
door sitting in the stool.
There are 3 bars in the telephone.
In the coffee bar there are
workers all over.
The vermouth is surrounded by walls.
The dictionary opens three
windows in it.
One is American window, and other
two are French.
The door jumps out of the window.
The bartender pours the
wine into the cigarette,
And fires the pot mouth.
I am you.
But he is not us.
They are you.
I am the same as you.
He is the same as them.
They are different with us.
You just answer you don't know.
Say something.
"What is the highest speed of love?"
"The answer is 68 kilometers per hour. "
"One kilometer added. It becomes 69."
That's OK.
Show of the original edition
In the coming election on Sunday,
Armed forces will be dispatched
to protect those 535 candidates.
Say something.
Just leave me alone.
It is the evening of the day.
I sit and watch the children play.
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me.
I sit and watch as tears go by.
My riches...
can't buy anything.
I want to hear the children sing.
All I hear is the sound
of rain falling on the ground.
I sit and watch as tears go by.
It is the evening of the day.
I sit and watch the children play.
Doing things I used to do.
They think are new...
I sit and watch as tears go by.
That is the house.
Whatever you do
You can't avoid your
responsibilities for others.
Silent
Sometimes has the same
power as speaking.
Separation also hurts us as approach.
Careless and nosiness will both
Dissolve love.
Anxiety of one side will only
cause the impatience
Of the other side.
Are our lives just a pack of nothing?
All of them? Or everywhere of them?
Compared with how to draft our lives,
We need to think what we have lost.
There is an absolute standard
called ethic
In the center of my own existence.
Absolute could only
appear at this moment.
The past, the future,
Neither of them could restrict me.
Compared with others,
Richard and I have chosen a
stronger way of life.
Miss Daisy Canion please
go to the 4th solarium
Miss Daisy Canion please go to
the 4th solarium
Miss Ruby Gentry please go to
the 7th Oxygenation Room
Miss Ruby Gentry please go to
the 7th Oxygenation Room
Dr. Ludwig, Dr. Edward Ludwig
Hello doctor.
Hello, who are you?
Paula Nelson
You may go to other doctors
if you need a special cure.
No, I just want to ask you some questions.
Are you a journalist?
Who tell you that?
You come from Paris?
Yes. I want ask you that
Does Richard Po...
really die of heart paralysis?
Are you and him are sister and brother?
No. We are lovers;
we are engaged two year ago.
Two years ago...
Is that the time of Marseilles Event?
Answer my question first, please.
In my opinion, there's nothing
in this medical certificate
That makes me doubt.
Those Jews killed
in the concentration camp
Are all died of heart paralysis,
as they said.
Did you work with him before
going to Atlantic City?
Excuse me.
Widmark is a frequent visitor. Be kind.
Why did you be a coroner?
That's because we have the fellowship of
playing tennis three times together a week.
I was the president of the club that time.
Seeing him so boring I asked
him to play together with me.
He is so lonely.
A lonely man wouldn't die.
Don't you feel that between
loneliness and illness
There is some kind of relationship?
Don't treat me half-hearted any more.
I just want to know the truth.
Do you hate my words?
I have no idea.
You should learn something from
Charles Dickens.
Melville Hammott?
You have been the secretary
of the mayor, haven't you?
That mayor was assassinated
in the exploding of the gas station
Because he was a Commie.
The Communist Party was revolutionary
40 years before. It is different now;.
Did you ever see
His family?
I'm his fianc¨¦e.
I can handle the revenge.
Do you have any grievance?
Yes.
OK. No more nonsense. Excuse me.
I am about to begin.
I'm going to fight a duel
with those people
Who intend to conceal this event.
But before that
I still have something to prepare.
To take things which
belong to Richard back,
I went a place which
I known from others
In a sunny afternoon,
Which is a perfect time for
color photography.
A stranger said to me
"Go to the garage and check"
But his northern accent was
Nearly the same with the typist
who had work with him.
Where am I?
I feel like passing through countless
countries which is bathing in blood.
A war is war like.
No matter what it is called,
It is still a war.
However, does life
Could be called a war?
Does only fewer killing than a war
Makes the rule of life?
Where is here?
What's the matter, sister?
I'm talking about you!
Was he in the hospital
of the army that time?
Who gave you this address?
Someone of the district.
And then I remembered that
he liked the cars
Moreover I saw his Alfa-Romeo
I have asked the idiot
Donald to burn here.
Is this an advertisement
for the election?
Maybe it is.
Did you kill him?
Why?
I found the body at the doctor's
place.
Dr. Corvo?
I know nothing at all.
You may cheat the film audiences,
but not me.
Why you want to revenge Richard?
You may be surprise if I tell.
It's my ideal.
Is it?
He once wrote an editorial
Which is called "Fascist is the result
of ethic becoming dolls".
What did you do to him?
What you need to ask is what he did to me.
Someone has warned me that you will come.
You need not to get back so fast.
Who attacked me?
This should be my question.
And the answer should be from your.
I killed him, because
I had the evidence that he assassinated the mayor.
He had committed murder for two times.
As to the criminal law,
Marseilles or Chicago has done a
better job than here.
You know it is me who am in
charge of this organization.
I'm in charge of the 5th area.
No.
You kill me will not make any sense.
You need think it over
The problem is whether
you know that thing exists or not.
I don't know.
Tell her we know what
you are looking for.
She knows that Richard has die.
And I answer him that all that
to me is Chinese.
It's cold!
It's so cold!
Still cold!
I feel like I'm in Antarctica.
Antarctica.
Here is Antarctica.
It's far away.
No warm at all.
Warm.
I Passed the Equator,
And the Sahara.
It's getting hotter.
I have the last breath.
It's close.
Have a listen to his voice.
Chapter 3
Eternal revolution, that's political.
If the variety of economic
groups and their diligence
Could exceed the chanciness of the economy,
there is efficiency.
Chapter 7
Robespierre and St.
Just in the guiding principle
Have already foreseen.
In the guiding principles the reality
Which Robespierre and St.
Just foresaw and visualized
Is very surprising.
The year after next it will be realized.
I'm one of the people
who have carried on this thought.
Chapter 12
The development of destiny of government
is terminated temporarily.
The independences of colonial,
the battle aiming for the victory of
civil war and the position of republican president
Exploit new domain for the
activity of every cell.
My point of view has changed.
Why did I meet the doctor?
Why did I get to the hospital of the army?
There are on dangers.
Although today's kills are also simple,
I tell her,
Here,
At the tie with black suit.
Many of friends at Paris
May have regained the power.
I know that.
The public opinion never get their
Precise conclusion by
Analyzing opinions from every side.
Certainly it does not.
It is based on that information
Leaked out of the secret official stack.
This is a typical technique,
Repeatedly.
The public opinion never get their
Precise conclusion by
Analyzing opinions from every side.
It is based on that information
Leaked out of the secret official stack.
It is a typical technique of the police country.
After meeting those two people
I perfectly realized the meaning
of the existence of those secret police.
You are really good student from
science university.
They shout that people in country
programming office are untrustworthy.
Though they have no secrets.
This maybe a lie.
It's not you or me killed Typhus.
But there must be
ones for the same purpose.
Let's help eachother.
Average the profits.
What's up? Does chanticleers
turn into cuckoos?
Do you go in for me?
Because the cuckoos do.
Kroutchov's speech in the
Youths league meeting.
It's you killed him.
But why this is unreasonable.
So coincident?
You will understand soon.
What about you?
You gossip!
Whatis wrong?
What?
Very good.
Things you know.
Can you tell something you presume?
It's better not to say it.
You are the suspect of the murder.
Only I have the proof
of not being there that time.
He is very handsome.
His partner killed my underling in Dakar.
They worked for Bony and Lafont
We work for Colonel Passy in London.
Called.
"I thought I saw a Pussy Cat. "
Stop! I will take her away.
Go quickly.
I know.
I hate the police.
I can not describe this
feeling in any words.
That girl.
She killed my uncle.
He is a fool.
Wait outside.
That girl.
I hate the police.
I can not describe this
feeling in any words.
You have traded with Typhus, right?
No, it's a mistake.
Is it?
Then I think.
That is friendship without trade.
In other words, you will meet
in any way, right?
So it is.
What do you want?
<The Legend Of Atlantis>.
This Mr Typhus is not the old
Liutenant Jo Attila.
I have nothing to tell you.
Always like this.
Police in Paris thinked local
people of fools.
Do you want to say anything?
Richard"'s friend?
I have nothing to tell you.
25 Bon Hocht Road
He has been working there for
three months since Jan 25th.
What about others?
Waiting for the bus.
Secret.
Richard hated dying of gradual doating.
He was suicided.
He was hurt in the
head three metres behind.
This is usual things.
I am looking for the real name.
Marie Dufour
Give the the phone.
Why?
Say "calm" to me.
I thinked suicide.
Why?
This is your experience
after his death.
Because of their torture?
With a razor blade
In order to receive some
solutions from Richard.
He tortured him.
With a razor blade
In order to receive
some solutions from Richard.
He tortured him cruelly.
Terrible, isn't it?
Yes.
Freedom.
Excuse me.
I am Richard's sister.
He used to working here in Feb and Mar.
Is there any letter for me?
I know nothing.
What's the matter?
Richard's name.
Was heard from the manager
department just the moment.
We are all afraid. The salary's
raising is to stop our argumentum.
Richard is really a good person.
Only he is.
Once he came to my home, I asked
him to help me casting accounts.
In the villa in suburb.
Where is it?
Round the war-airdrome.
Exactly on Preminger Road.
So it is.
Do you understand anything?
Maybe.
What's the matter?
Probably you still want to drive me away.
Officer Aldrich is really a
person full of finesse.
Little does one think, He took the first.
He is a boastful person.
It's so annoying.
Don't laugh.
Do you want to tell him my words?
I pretend not heard.
The principal of the fifth district
is me, not him.
Of course.
What did you say?
Who?
David Goodis.
Aldrich asked again,
but he still told nothing.
He said that all is a misunderstanding.
"Perhaps not that girl. "
"I haven't seen her before. "
What did you say to him?
Nothing.
I considered.
The one killed Typhus and
the one beat you.
Are the same obviously.
He is so silly.
That peoson has found nothing now.
Doctor Ludwig?
Likely.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
The doctor didn't know the inside?
You are also the important hostage.
Do you think so?
Richard is just a dreamer.
Dreamer of communism?
Like that Picasso was expeled
when he died.
That was just a play.
A big sleight of hand.
Which confused you and others.
Because Widmark is the killer.
Lend me the "Kreisler".
I was taken to the hotel.
And was threatened of killing
if I would escape.
I didn't tell the location of the villa.
"Double-deck house. "
"To us. "
"Garden D4 Armide. "
"Tower A."
"You. "
There are no changes.
The police still doubted me.
I was immured by Widmark.
Give him another call.
Try to tell him that the
murder's name I considered.
Is the same as his.
Chapter 19 Comrades, the age changes.
But there are full of lies everywhere.
Social authorities.
Those who afraid of turbulence.
Always use patriotism as
the quillet.
The government only talks
about the patriotism.
Uses the nucleus threat to
instigate people.
Devolves our line of sight form the
practical social problems.
Chapter 47.
The right-wing soldier Dumouriez
likes dyslogistic foppishness.
As the cry up of the people's courage.
Give the simple sensation.
Politics.
Money.
What happens when invovled in such things?
Richard
Chapter 48.
Bounteous serching.
Release Frech politics from the
huge power.
While aiming this.
Why connive some people's crimes?
Faced such question.
Comrades, I can answer that.
The power begins to split.
That would be Armagnac and the
Burgundian barons.
And Danton? And Dumouriez?
The politics begins to swing.
This because of the great
elder's command.
Does the politics begin to swing?
Poeple are forced to buy expensive food.
Because of the taller
elder's command.
The high price is consured and his
position was unstable.
Fluctuates when the comrades confuse.
Chapter 89
The essential cause of mistake.
Is the uncut relationship between the
self-called left-wing colleagues and the opponent.
So they begin to accept the "Communism".
Ask the comrades.
If there is no anti-American tendency,
there is no difference.
Those who resists like Lecanuet.
What is the so-called advancement?
Can it be considered as the
overthrow of the government?
Though the result is clear.
Though the new republic union.
Possesses the majority of the seat
in a legislature, the Communist still exists.
If the ministerial party and the
anti-communism right-wings.
Lasso
The so-called advanced communists to possess
the majority of the seat in a legislature.
The trust of the democratic
government will decline rapidly.
Our way will be pluged up.
As the replacement of this project.
For the final success of the
Frech Communist Party.
We still need hard working.
This is the best responses
to the anti-communists.
They don't want to see the
left-wing's triumph.
Probably.
Really.
In order to repay the boss
who doesn't attach importance to him.
Donald came and brought
victim Richard's photo.
It was really a political movie.
Just like Walt Disney's movie
with red-handed scenes.
He eventually told the truth.
It was he killed Typhus and his nephew.
After disordered the room.
There wew many horrific things
during this seraching-treasure time.
He believes neither the secret
amanuensis nor the polt.
He only believes money.
He confessed the villa.
He said that if I would give him
two millions, he would take me there.
He wanted to go to South-American.
To achieve his dream.
He organized foreign force
in local area.
And said that to kill all the
Jews and Black people.
Chinese and Indians.
WHich better?
The presupposed death or
the sudden death?
Sudden death.
My God.
My God.
This is the best responses to
the anti-communists.
Making claer the cause of his death.
Drives me to live all along.
"The memory is waking up. "
"The Brown crimp. "
Can you continue?
OK.
"He no longer believes. "
Then?
Stop! Run away!
"The wonderful destiny.
" Let's meet in the villa an hour later.
We can go into the street safely now.
Really?
The things about Typhus are over.
Because in Paris.
There is a command of
stopping searching.
Aren't you surprised?
I feel indifferent.
Such a arid woman.
Do you mean me?
I heard from Widmark.
The one who killed Typhus.
Was a private eye
called Marc Dickson.
For the moment I believed him.
It's the sequela of the Maroc War.
Have they caught Marc Dickson?
He is now wanted but
we have little thread.
Why?
Because he died in the big fire in Maroc.
Then why he is wanted now?
We know it because the
absebce of the adjudgement.
Only two persons. One is me,
who affiliated with his sister.
The other is.
Widmark?
No.
It's a woman dressed floridly.
Exact the same colour
as that of you wear.
Orange? Yellow?
Isn't the whole thing over?
Though.
Any doubtful point?
Though not suspect, there are
some doubtful points.
You let him enter you room, right?
No, the one entered my room.
Was a thief.
Did you live in the same
hotel in coincidence?
No.
I don't understand.
Didn't you have a appointment?
No, I had never thought of meeting him.
I knew that Richard was
killed from the newspaper.
Then I came. I believe
that he is the same.
Who do you vote 2 years ago?
It dosen't matter.
Just a survey.
And published on The Express in 1966.
What did it publish?
Interesting things.
Editorials by Richard.
Yes, he didn't resign that time.
I resigned when the country intervened.
Why?
Because I think advertisement
is just a form of fascism.
When Goodis overthrew the confession,
I understood.
I am not a fool.
You indulged in the politics.
There are only revenge and jealousy.
The friendship will
only be dishallowed.
I will go back to Paris.
You should act well.
It's all for you.
We are living in a stale world.
The world where nothing happens.
But other where is completely opposite.
"Tomorrow kiss bye. "
If you keep silence.
It will trouble others.
I don'r believe.
Call Ludwig.
It's the last time.
What's your name?
Robert Mac Namara.
Do you hate killing?
It's my job. I have no method.
What about you?
Richard Nixon,
I have the same opinion.
Go to the boss's house.
Where is it?
I know.
Let's go.
"Freedom. "
The colour of the dress
are always yellow and red.
The sound changes.
Tortured that woman.
Then knew the villa's location.
I answered.
It's not the first time to do
such despicable thing.
Agadir, the subway in Charonne
Mohdi Bon Barka.
I payed that fat woman
a hundred thousand franc.
To make her silence about the fire.
It doesn't change. Bleeding,
horror and politics.
Also money.
It's really unfortunate to be
involved in such things.
Richard
As the replacement of this project.
For the final success of the
Frech Communist Party.
We still need hard working.
The one who was killed in the
fire in Paul Lacroix.
Was Richard.
The ministerial party brings to bear
crimes to the communists that time.
So it's easy to understand.
He was killed becaude he was too active.
He wanted to eacape.
I didn't let him go.
I was to go back to Paris and
do not pay attention to Donald.
But.
Now that I came here,
I will do something completely.
Kept acting, kept lying.
On the seaside of Italy.
It was impossible to enjoy the sunshine.
We didn't trust each other any more.
We only felt chill about
this dangerous gambling.
We kept away each other.
Time reveals a person's heart.
It was Donald killed Typhus.
It's not sure.
Trust each other?
I will too.
Candidly.
Like "gambling ÁÐÄþÈ«¼¯" and so on.
If "it's fine outside"
I even don't believe myself.
The rather that to trust you.
Completely unreasonable.
I think of a way.
How?
I mutiny, and then.
Say some adverse witness.
I still don't understand.
Write a letter.
Write "I killed Typhus" in it.
Then sign it.
Then give it to you.
It's not good.
We can do it under advisement.
I trust you.
But you also need write.
What should I write?
A letter.
Should I still write
"I killed Typhus" in it?
Silly thinking.
No, you write
"I killed Richard" in it.
The question is
whether I can survive.
I will arrange it.
<The Monde>in 10th, Oct.
Talks about the Kennedy's murder.
17 witness disappeared successively.
"I killed Richard. "
"I killed Typhus. "
"All is for money. "
"He came to my room. "
"His death was an accident. "
"We argued. "
"Ludwig did all of it. "
"I beat his head with ashtray. "
Because doctor Ludwig had
strong influence to the politics.
Things calmed down soon.
"17th, Sep, 1966"
"PaulWidmark, 17th, Sep. "
"Paula Nelson"
How?
Not bad.
Show your hands!
What?
Don't move.
Finally the proof was found.
Therefore you let e write this
letter, don't you?
No proof.
Nothing is immerged.
You are lying.
I need not lie.
Now.
Do you prepare to die?
Thanks, David
"Far from time and space. "
"People are confused. "
"Thin like hair. "
"Fecundity like dawn. "
"I listen carefully. "
"Open my eye. "
"Stretch my hands out. "
"To search the future way. "
"But no results. "
I finally finished my novel
because of you.
No thanks.
David, prepare to die too.
Don't disguise the truth any more.
Through your novel
we all know the truth.
The poems and the truth are relative.
Why do you always say metaphor?
Saying about "time" not because of
the visit of time.
Saying about "space" because of
the disappearance the space.
Saying about "time" because of
the lapse of the time.
Saying about "person".
Because that person will die.
Paula, you deprived my youth.
David.
Such a miserable endding.
Where is it?
Am I talking?
I am talking. Really.
Now the thoughts become deep.
Did I kill others with this
pair of hands?
Suddenly I forget my crimes.
Before the next crime.
Am I feeling the secret of my inside?
Life, wraps me in this inundatory time.
Night.
Has no endding as the daylight.
The noght is deep.
I continue moving.
Towards the road of the dawn.
Birth.
Death.
Life of the Things with me.
Life of me who
cherishs Richard's body.
My knowledge is certain.
And originally is a kind of
uncomplete disguise.
Only a kind of thing changes
my spirit and body.
My consciousness.
Picked me up from the world disappeared.
The tragedy of haste.
Phillippe...
What's up?
Who are you?
I am the collector from the broadcasting
station, at Chateauroux. And you?
I escaped from the "ºÚ°µÊÂ¼þ".
And killed two persons just now.
My name is Paula.
What do you want?
Take me.
Ok.
"0 year, left wing. "
Don't worry. Fascist age doesn't come.
It certainly will come.
If it spreads everywhere,
it's better.
Just like barge,
mini skirt and rock-and-roll.
But, the fighting will
continue everytime.
I mean fightinf in the heart.
Horrible, isn't it?
If you are tired before the fighting.
Maybe you will be killed.
Any cigarette?
In that box.
Take one?
Things about Richard.
Finally take the revenge.
But your words are quite impenetrable.
And the case of Ben Barka, is it over?
It already passed.
Though it passed
I have my principals.
Are you still working
for the book concern?
Will you write a book
about these things?
Perhaps a book as that
which you did want to do on Oswald?
Good idea.
Then don't refer the principals
any more.
You are just like before.
"The horrible child Elisabeth.
The left and the right are the same.
People do not change.
The right wing, though.
Silly and depraved.
But the left wing is too moonstruck.
And.
Compared with the right.
The left is full of things
completely out of date.
I don't want it.
Then what should we do in the future?
