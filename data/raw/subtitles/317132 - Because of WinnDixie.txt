Safe!
In the beginning,
when we moved to Naomi,
it was just the preacher
and me.
Only sometimes-
most ofthe time, really-
it seemed like it was me alone.
And then, one morning,
the preacher sent me
to the store for a box
ofmacaroni and cheese,
some white rice
and two tomatoes.
And after that,
everything changed.
But I'm getting ahead
ofmyself.
It's a good story.
Let me tell it right.
I appreciate you com i n'.
I real ly do.
Thank you very much.
All right, have a seat in there.
- Oh, is that a...
- Good morning.
Is that for me, I hope?
- Yes, it sure is.
- Yeah
I feel blessed
to be brought here to Naomi
to do God's work
in His new church.
I have to admit,
I'm-I'm still trying
to get used to the idea
of His house being
in a convenience store.
Nothing wrong with making church
more convenient.
I have preached in some pretty
strange places in my time.
Not that... not that this is
a strange place.
I didn't mean that.
I ju... Ah!
Opal.
Come on in.
Come on.
Sit down.
Please.
Glad you finally made it.
This is my daughter, India Opal.
Forgive us.
We're new here.
Still trying to find
ourway around.
Maybe, uh, one ofyou two boys
could teach Opal
a better shortcut
to church, hmm?
PREACHER:
No?
Oh, well, let-let us pray.
Our Father,
who art in Heaven...
OPAL:
It's me, God.
Ifit's not too much trouble,
I'd like some friends.
I don't know that many kids.
Only the ones from church...
and there aren't
that many here.
There 's ol'Amanda Wilkinson,
whose face is always pinched up
Iike she 's smellin 'somethin '
real bad.
And Sweetie Pie Thomas,
who 's only five years old,
still mostly a baby, and is
always suckin ' on her knuckle.
And there 's Dunlap
and Stevie Dewberry.
And I know they can 't help it
that they're bald, God.
Their mama shaved their heads,
on account ofDunlap got fleas
in his hair
from their cat, Sadie.
But even the bald Dewberry boys
don 't want to be
my friend, anyway.
And one more thing, God.
I miss my mama.
Please, God, I'd really like
to see my mama again.
Amen.
CONG REGATI ON:
Amen.
AN NOU NCER
Unless it's good supervision.
PREACH ER:
Opal, come on!
No TV untilyou put
some ofthat stuffaway.
AN NOUNCER
Brett Parker
in that hitting streak...
I'll bet they already have
a new pitcher.
We're not moving back to Watley.
I know it's hard
movin' all the time,
but that's part of myjob.
OPAL:
Up and at 'em, Daddy!
OPAL:
Up and at 'em, Daddy!
I made orange juice!
Daddy, I made orange juice!
Daddy!
WOMAN ( over P.A. ): Well, folks,
we've got some wonderful specials today
I want to tell you about
in Aisle 3.
Uh, in the meat department,
you'll notice
the pork chops are...
FEMALE EMPLOYEE:
Did you see it?
MALE EMPLOYEE:
Come on. Come on.
We can get him
over here. Come on.
MALE EMPLOYEE #2:
There he goes, that way!
FEMALE EMPLOYEE:
Oh! Get over here!
I'll get him!
Comin'-comin'
through!
WOMAN
Boyd?
Boyd Lee,
could you please approach
the produce section?
What... what in the Sam Hill
is goin' on?
What is goin' on?
WOMAN
Please report
to the produce section, Boyd.
BOYD:
I'm in the produce section.
What? What is it?
WOMAN
It's a dog, Boyd.
BOYD:
We can't have no dog
in the Winn-Dixie.
Well, don't let him get
by the eggs!
MALE EMPLOYEE:
He's gone left! We're goin' left!
Look, there he goes!
Stop him! Stop him!
Hey! He's goin' around!
Go get him!
MALE EMPLOYEE:
I got him! I got him!
BOYD:
Tracy, go 'round that way!
Get the do...!
Cut him off!.
MALE EMPLOYEE:
He's goin' that way!
BOYD
No!
Get that dog!
MALE EMPLOYEE:
He's under the table!
FEMALE EMPLOYEE:
I think he's trapped now, y'all.
Will somebody grab
that dog, please?!.
Somebody, grab that dog!
Somebody, grab that d...
Get him off of me!
I don't like dogs.
Somebody, get him
off of me.
OPAL:
It's okay, sir.
All that dog wants to do
is get face-to-face with you
and thankyou for the good time
he's havin'.
Call the pound!
Mike, go call the pound.
OPAL:
Wait!
Don't call the pound!
That's my dog!
And then I knew
I haddone somethin'big.
Maybe stupid, too.
But I couldn't help it.
I couldn't let them take
that dog to the pound.
Here, boy!
Come on, boy!
Here, Wi nn-Dixie!
BOYD:
Who named the dog "Winn-Dixie"?
Me. It's his name, honest.
Don't you know better
than to bring a dog
in the grocery store?
OPAL:
Sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.
I promise.
Come on, Winn-Dixie.
Well, what are
all y'all lookin' at?
That dog almost ate my face off.
Sit.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Sometimes the preacherlooked
just like a turtle
hidin' inside its shell:
in there,
thinkin'about things,
and not ever stickin'his head
out into the world.
Daddy?
Yes, what is... what is it?
Wh-What is it, Opal?
I found a dog,
and I want to keep him.
You... A dog?
Now, we have been
through this before.
You do not need a dog.
I know it.
I know I don't need a dog,
but this dog needs me.
Oh, he doesn't neither need you.
He does, too!
Oh, for goodness' sakes, it don't...
Yes, it does!
Winn-Dixie!
Here, boy!
The last thing in the
world that we need
- is a... Uh!
Ow.
This isn't a dog. It's a horse.
And he's homeless, too.
Yeah, and he's got
a stink to him, too.
I know it.
Well, he needs all the help
he can get, right?
I could be doing my duty.
Yeah, well...
OPAL:
Look, he's smilin' at you.
Don't you love a dog
with a sense ofhumor?
Oh, would you run
and get the tweezers?
I think he's got
something stuck in his paw.
Here.
Yeah.
He's a nice dog, isn't he?
He's a great dog, isn't he?
You can't keep this dog, Opal.
Oh, please, Daddy, look at him!
He's skinny!
He's needs to be fed well.
- And bathed, too!
- No.
- Oh, please...
- No, no, no.
- Please!
- No! No! I said no.
Please?
All right, he can stay here
while you're trying
to find him a home
oryou figure out
where he belongs.
- He can stay?!.
- Temporarily.
Yes!
You're not
keepin' him, Opal.
This is temporary, so don't
go getting your hopes up.
- I know it, sir.
We're not gettin'
our hopes up,
are we, Winn-Dixie?
- Good.
- No, no, no.
Why don't you go
make some signs
so folks'll know
that, you know,
you found a dog
who needs a home.
Come on, Winn-Dixie!
And a bath and a shower.
And a bath and a shower.
Hey, hey, come back here,
Winn-Dixie!
Little miss...
you thinkyou're using up
enough water?
Uh, we still got to rinse.
Opal, where'd you get that hose?
I didn't thinkyou'd mind
ifl borrowed it.
Well, I do mind!
Oh!
I'm sorry, Mr. Alfred!
- I'm sorry!
- Whoa!
MR. ALFRED:
Come back here, you stupid dog, you!
Ifl catch you,
so help me, you won't...
Oh!
MR. ALFRED:
I made an exception for the kid.
But there is no exception
for that mongrel.
You see that sign
on the front of my trailer?
Does anybody
read my signs?
We're-we're
not keeping him.
We're trying to
find him a good home.
Well, hurry it up,
or I'm calling the pound.
We...
Daddy?
Dry that dog off, Opal.
And dryyourself off, too.
You know, Winn-Dixie,
if my mom were around,
I bet she'd let me keep you.
Ever since we moved here,
I've been thinking
about my mama extra hard.
Opal, I hope that dog's
not in your bed.
OPAL:
Yes, sir.
I-I mean, no, sir, he's not.
I really don't
know where she is.
She left
when I was only threeyears old.
I can't hardly remember her.
PREACHER: And make sure
you gotyourwindow shut tight.
Don't want that rain gettin' in.
OPAL:
Okay.
The preacher?
It's no use.
He won't talk to me at all
about her.
I betyou don't remember
your mama much, either.
So we're really alike,
you and me.
Think I should
make the preacher
tell me about her?
Mm, I'll think about it.
You're supposed to be in bed.
Daddy,
can you tell me about Mama?
Uh, I knowyou don't
like to talk about her,
but I don't even remember
what she looked like.
What did she look like?
I don't need to know a lot.
Just a few things.
She'd tell you
not to stay up so late.
PREACHER:
Opal.
You ready to head out
and put up those signs?
Yes, sir.
Hold on.
No, leave him here.
- Stay here.
Stay.
What the...?
God... bless it.
Opal, would you bring
that dog inside, please?
Come on, Winn-Dixie.
That night,
I wrote down in myjournal
that what the preacher
couldn't see
is that Winn-Dixie wasn't lost.
And I didn't find him.
He found me.
He was a dog
who knew how to be a friend.
Hey, boy.
Where are we goi n'?
You I i ke that?
I bet with a col lar like that
you'd feel like
you belonged to somebody.
Well, maybe we
could afford it.
- Winn-Dixie.
Hello?
BIRD
Hello?
Hello.
BI RD:
Hello.
BI RD:
Hello.
Hello.
Hello?
I-I-I'm sorry.
Do you work here?
Yeah, but we're closed.
Hey. Hey.
Don't mind him.
That's just how he says hello.
Um, that's Winn-Dixie
and I'm Opal.
I'm, uh, Otis.
BIRD:
Otis.
Well, Otis,
my dog sure likes
this red collar,
but I don't get
a big enough allowance
to afford somethin' this fancy.
Well, look, Miss.
I'm mostlyjust here
to take care ofthe animals.
BIRD:
Otis.
Shut up, idiot.
I was thinking
maybe we could set up
an installment plan.
Well, I don't think
I can do that.
Well, I could work foryou.
I could come in and
sweep the floors
and straighten
up the shelves
and take out the trash.
I could do that.
Well, that's what I do.
Oh.
Well, you sure need some help.
BI RD:
Otis. Hello.
I'm real trustworthy.
But the only thing is,
Winn-Dixie, my dog,
he'd have to come inside with me
while I work.
He doesn't like
to be left alone.
Well, Gertrude doesn't like dogs.
She owns a pet shop
and she don't like dogs?
Yeah.
No, I mean, that Gertrude.
The parrot.
Gertrude.
It's named
after the owner.
Doesn't like dogs.
Well, she might like Winn-Dixie.
Almost everybody does.
Ifthe two of'em get along,
then could I have the job?
Mm, I don't know.
GERTRUDE:
Dog. Dog. Dog!
I know it's a dog.
Gertrude's a pretty bird.
Hello.
Hello, dog.
See? She likes him.
That's pretty amazing,
don't you think?
OTIS:
I'll be damned.
Then we're all set, then. Thanks.
No, wait, Miss.
I can't-I can't
just giveyou a job.
- I can't just giveyou a...
- Thankyou.
You won't be sorry.
I'm a real hard worker.
That's nice.
Thankyou for listening.
Have a nice day, ma'am.
Have a nice day.
Little ten-year-old kid
walk in here,
make me look like a idiot.
GERTRUDE:
Shut up, idiot.
Yeah?
Need some help?
Get rid ofthat dog.
Oh, Lord.
What did he, uh,
what'd he do now?
Nothin'.
He don't have
to do nothin'.
I make the rules here,
and it's plain: no pets.
Well, you know,
Opal's been very responsible
with the dog, Mr. Alfred.
She's still lookin'
for a home.
Uh, well, get me a photo.
I'll post it on eBay.
I'll getyou competing
bids within an hour.
Okay, thankyou,
but I don't think
that's necessary.
You just stay here rent-free
because I can write it off
as a charitable donation
to the church.
But my charity stops
with that animal.
You know how much
we appreciate
the accommodation here, sir.
Call the pound.
Mr. Alfred, please.
I'm sure
we can work somethin' out.
I mean,just give us
a little bit more time.
You want a home or a dog?
Call the pound.
Well, yeah, I just-I just figure
you got such a nice, big place
over there, you know.
And, uh, and he's, and
I'm sure he'd be fine
with-with your other dogs.
Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.
- Don't let him seeyou.
Uh-huh, yeah, look,
he's very playful.
Yeah, he's great with kids.
Opal thinks
the world ofhim.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Well, listen,
ifyou think ofsomebody,
you be sure to give me a call,
all right?
- Okay.
- Come back here, Winn-Dixie.
I hope to seeyou
in church on Sunday.
- Come on.
Okay, all right.
Bye, now.
No.
OPAL:
Winn-Dixie.
Dixie.
Dixie. No!
- Opal. Opal. Opal.
Come on. Come on.
I know, I know.
- No!
- Sir, I need you to sign
- this release form, please.
- It's not right, Daddy.
- You know it isn't!
- Opal.
No!
Stop that right now.
- Please, Daddy.
He's the only friend I have!
Don't take him away.
Please.
- Please.
Please?
Wait.
Don't take him.
What, this isn't the dog?
Uh, there's
been a mistake.
That isn't the dog.
Come on. Get him inside.
Let's go.
OPAL:
The preacher took a loan out from church
and paid offour rent,
but he had to promise Mr. Alfred
that he would find Winn-Dixie a home
before the end ofsummer.
I would have promised
anybody anything.
I was just so happy
to have Winn-Dixie with me.
And I was happy to have a job
at Gertrude 's Pets.
This is our town.
See?
Ki nda lonely, isn't it?
What?
Hey, Winn-Dixie.
Wait... wait for me, boy.
Hey, Winn-Dixie.
Winn-Dixie, come back here.
That's the library.
Winn-Dixie,
you can't go in there.
It says so on the sign.
Wow, look at all those books.
Oh, my goodness.
Are you al I ri ght?
It's a bear.
A bear?
I t's a bear.
He's come back.
- He has?
- Yes. Yes.
Where is he?
He's right out there.
That's no bear.
That's just a dog.
It's my dog, Winn-Dixie.
A dog?
Oh. I...
It's your dog?
Oh. You sure?
Yes, ma'am, I'm positive.
I'd know him anywhere.
- All right.
- Let me help you up.
- Oh.
- Come on.
( woman panting )
- It's okay.
Mm.
Wh-Who are you?
- I'm India Opal.
- Oh.
But you can just call me Opal.
Well, I'm Miss Franny.
You must think
I'm a silly ol' thing
mistaking a dog for a bear.
Areyou sure that is a dog?
Yes, ma'am.
- I'm sure.
- Hmm.
He just don't like to
be left alone is all.
Mm-hmm.
Sorry to botheryou,
Miss Franny.
Well, I-I had a bad experience
with a bear
coming into Herman W. Block
Memorial Library,
and I've never quite
gotten over it.
A bear came into the library?
Oh, yes.
It's quite a story.
Sure would like to hear it.
But Winn-Dixie
gets lonelywithout me.
Well...
maybe we could
make an exception.
Now, one hot Thursday,
way back then,
I was sittin' here
in the library,
and all the doors and windows
were wide open.
And I had my nose in a book
until I noticed
a very peculiar smell.
A very strong smell.
And I raised
my eyes up slowly
and standing
right in front of me was a bear.
- A very large bear.
How large was it?
At least four times
the size ofyour dog.
That big?
Wow.
Then what happened?
I very slowly
and very carefully raised up
the book I was reading.
What bookwas that?
Warand Peace.
And I carefully aimed it,
and I threw it
right at him!
- Be gone!
Good dog.
Thankyou.
And do you know what?
No, ma'am. What?
This is why I will never forget.
He took the book with him.
Nuh-uh.
Yes, ma'am,
he snatched it up
and ran off.
Did he ever come back?
No.
I never saw him again.
Well, the men in town,
they used to tease me about it.
They used to say, "Miss Franny,
"we saw that bear ofyours
out in the woods today.
"He was reading
Warand Peace
"and said it sure was good,
andhe'dlike
to check it out again. "
Ah, I imagine I'm the only one
who even recalls that bear.
You don't have a husband
or children?
Mm, I never married.
Why not?
I didn't have the need.
Butyou don't have anyone.
I have these books.
Now, look at that.
That dog is smilin' at me.
Would you like to be friends?
You and me and Winn-Dixie?
Would you wanna
be friends?
Why, that would be fine.
That would be grand.
Just grand.
OPAL:
Winn-Dixie was better
at makin'friends
than anyone I had everknown.
I talked to him
about everything.
And he was
a real good listener.
Just about everything good
that happened that summer
happened because ofWinn-Dixie.
¡Ó Oh... ¡Ó
¡Ó Hey... ¡Ó
¡Ó Oh... ¡Ó
U h-oh.
¡Ó Hey... ¡Ó
GERTRU DE:
Dog.
- Dog!
Help me here.
Oh, God.
- Stop it, Winn-Dixie.
- Ah. Ooh.
OTIS:
Help me get 'em back in the...
- Ooh.
-...cages.
I'll get the rabbits.
OTIS:
You idiot.
- Sarah...
Sarah, come here, sweetie.
- Come on, come on.
Son of a...
OPAL:
Play some more music.
What?
What I said was,
play some more music, Otis.
Far out.
Do it again.
Wel l, it seems
to be working.
I 'm gonna go tell my ma
about what I seen.
That man's magic.
He's a magic man.
Bye, Magic Man.
- Bye, Opal.
Are you really a magic man?
I was just playin'
for the animals.
Uh...
They seem to...
they seem to like it.
Yes, sir.
Did they escape
from their cages?
No, I left the cages open.
You just let 'em roam around?
I don't know.
It's... it's no good
bein' locked up, though.
GERTRUDE:
Locked up.
Shut up.
Shut up, idiot.
Shouldn'tyou be sweepin' up?
Why don'tyou sweep up?
With your guitar?
Just sweep up the place and...
clean it up a little bit,
this mess.
¡Ó Hey...
He doesn't want to
be left alone is all.
Can't we bring him?
Can't bring a dog
to church, Opal.
Come on. We're
gonna be late.
It's a big day for me.
He's scared we'll
leave him for good
and never come back.
That mutt ain't got
a homeyet?
Uh, no, notyet, but
we're workin' on it.
I had a dog like that once, myself.
A real howler.
I got him to shut up.
You did? How?
I shot him.
Well, you can't shoot
a church-goin' dog.
It'd be a sin.
CHOI R:
¡Ó Amazing Grace ¡Ó
¡Ó How sweet the sound ¡Ó
¡ÓThat saved a wretch like me ¡Ó
¡Ó I once was lost ¡Ó
¡Ó But now am found ¡Ó
¡ÓWas blind... ¡Ó
¡Ó...but now I see ¡Ó
¡Ó 'Twas grace that taught ¡Ó
¡Ó My heart to fear ¡Ó
¡Ó And grace my fears relieved ¡Ó
¡Ó How precious did... ¡Ó
All right, all right!
That's enough. That's enough.
Please, stop.
Everyone just stop, please.
- Please.
Thankyou.
Opal.
He doesn't know
the words is all.
But he sure is moved
by the spirit.
Get that dog, now.
Yes, sir.
Oh, my stars!
It's a face
only a mother could love.
Are dogs allowed in church?
Sit. Sit.
We, uh, we recently celebrated
the hundredth anniversary
of man learning to fly.
Now, that's the sort of miracle
that we tend to take
for granted nowadays.
But for hundreds ofyears,
man was taking that same kind
ofleap offaith...
and falling right on his butt.
Yep, folks, theywas
tyin' themselves to kites
and homemade wings and hurlin'
themselves off ofbarns
and crashin' off of cliffs.
So how did
the Wright brothers do it?
When everybody else was
nose-divin' for centuries?
They saw...
Don't even think about it.
...the unique value in all
the inventors around 'em.
Did you know that part
oftheirwing design
was actually the same design
as a railroad bridge?
- Yeah.
- No.
Isn't that a genius leap?
Usin' a bridge to fly?
- Keep on preaching!
I got him!
I got him!
And more importantly,
they had each other...
...working as brothers,
as a team.
It's the same reason we have...
Whoa! Look at him go!
Working together,
we can lift this town up!
More than just taking a leap
of faith, we can learn to fly!
Sorry!
Opal, stop that dog!
WOMAN:
Mm, mm, mm.
Never in my life.
A dog catchin' a mouse.
Let us pray...
for this mouse.
OPAL:
That sure was somethin'.
I bet Mama would have gotten
a big kick out of it.
Opal, the dog cannot
go back to church.
Everybodywas talkin'.
They said they
hadn't had
that much fun in church
in a long while.
Opal.
I
Doesn't it look better?
Now whereyou takin' me,
Winn-Dixie?
DUNLAP:
That doglooks like a dirtycarpet!
Yeah.
I can hearyou.
I can hearyou guys behind me.
You betterwatch out!
That dog's headed right
for the witch's house.
Winn-Dixie, come back here!
Winn-Dixie!
You better go get
your dog out ofthere.
Get lost,
you bald-headed babies!
Hey, that witch is gonna
eat that dog for dinner
and you for dessert!
I wouldn't go in there,
Baloney Breath.
Baloney Breath?
You're just a couple
of skinny-armed chickens.
We'll tell the preacher
what happened toyou.
Winn-Dixie?
Winn-Dixie, where areyou?
WOMAN:
Give me this, I said.
Let it go. Let it go!
Give it! Give it to me!
Let it go, I said.
- Stop it!
- Oh!
Who's there?
Um, please don't eat me.
D-D...
Don't eat me!
I don't taste good!
I don't taste good!
Please, help!
Eat you?
You silly child.
How can I eatyou?
Where's my dog?
Did you eat my dog?
Hardly.
But he darn near bit my hand off
stealing my sandwich!
Where is he?
Where is the dog?
Where's the dog?
Where is the d...
Oh, I hear him.
I hear him.
He's smackin' his lip.
He sure love peanut butter.
Listen at him.
I'm sorry I got
on your property.
Hmm.
My name's Opal.
My name is... Gloria.
Gloria Dump.
Isn't that
a terrible last name?
Dump?
Well, my last name's Buloni.
Sometimes the kids at school,
they call me Lunch Meat.
"Lunch Meat."
Oh, my.
Well, I'm pleased
to meetyou, Lunch Meat.
Whatyou call
your friend here?
- Oh, that's Winn-Dixie.
- Winn-Dixie?
You mean like the grocery store?
Now, that takes the
strange-name prize, don't it?
Woo-wee!
Oh, no. Hmm-mm.
This one's mine.
I'm gon' eat this one.
You know, baby girl...
these eyes of mine,
they don't see
too good no more.
You can't see?
Well... you know, I can...
I can see only
the general shape
ofthings.
So I rely on my heart.
Why don'tyou go ahead and tell
me everything aboutyourself,
so I can seeyou with my heart?
Well, the first thing you should
know about me is that...
my dad's the preacher,
which was why
we moved to Naomi.
OPAL:
I hadbeen waiting forso long
to tella person
everything about me,
I couldn't stop.
I told Gloria Dump everything.
And the whole time
I was talkin',
Gloria Dump was listening.
I see, I see.
But the most i m portant thi ng
you should know about me...
is that I don't have a mama.
You don't have a mama.
Somethin' happened to her
that made her go away,
and I don't know
what it was.
Well, then the Dewberry boys...
OPAL: I couldfeelherlistening
with all herheart.
And it felt good.
Wi nn-Dixie?
What's wrong, boy?
Quiet!
You'll wake the preacher.
Winn-Dixie.
Winn-Dixie, come back here!
Opal!
Opal!
What's going on with that dog?
- I don't know!
Come on, Winn-Dixie.
Come on, come on!
Come...
Winn-Dixie!
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I don't know
what's gotten into him.
It's just thunder.
It's okay.
Daddy, what ifhe hurts himself?
What ifhe tries
to get away?!.
Daddy, what's happening?!.
Let's get out ofthe way.
Oh...
Do you know what
a pathological fear is?
No, sir.
It is a fear that goes way
beyond normal fears.
It's a fear thatyou
can't be talked out of,
you can't be reasoned out of.
And I thinkWinn-Dixie
has a pathological fear
ofthunderstorms.
We get an awful lot of
thunderstorms in the summer.
Well, I 'm gonna have
to make sure
he doesn't get out
during a storm.
Might run away.
We'll have to make sure
we keep him safe.
Yes, sir.
I've been talkin'
to Winn-Dixie.
Oh, is that right?
I
He thinks,
since I'm ten years old,
you should tell me ten things
about my mama.
Why don'tyou just
go back to bed, Opal?
Just ten things, that's all.
One thing for each year
I've been alive.
He made it sound like
a reasonable request.
I should've known
you'd be more trouble.
You remind me
so much ofyour mama.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
But that doesn't count
as the first thing, okay?
Okay, all right.
Ten things... and then
it's offto bed, all right?
Okay, let's see.
One: She was funny.
She could make
just about anybody laugh.
Two: She had fair hair
and big eyes.
Just like me.
Exactly likeyou.
I kinda remember that.
Doya?
Mm? Good.
Three: She liked
to plant things.
She had a talent for it.
She could stick a tire
in the ground and grow a car.
Four: She could run.
Oh, was she fast!
You couldn't ever
race her, you know.
I mean, ifyou did,
y-you couldn't let her
get a head start.
Otherwise, she'd
beat you for sure.
What's number five?
She couldn't cook.
Burned everything, even water.
Six: Your mama
loved a good story.
She could sit and listen
to anybody tell a story.
She especially liked
funny ones, mm-hmm.
'Cause she loved to laugh.
What's number seven?
She knew all the constellations.
Every planet
in the nighttime sky.
And she could name 'em,
you know?
Point 'em out.
She never got tired
oflooking up at 'em.
Number eight...
She hated being
a preacher's wife.
She said she couldn't stand
havin' all those ladies
at church judgin' her
on how she sang and what shewas
wearing and what she cooked.
She said it made herfeel
like a bug under a microscope.
What's the ninth thing?
Number nine... is...
your mama loved you.
She loved you very much.
But she left me.
She left us.
Why'd she leave us?
She just...
packed her bags and left us.
Just... yeah.
Didn't leave one thing behind.
She didn't leave anything?
Nope.
Nothin'.
What's number ten, Daddy?
I think that's enough for now.
But that's only nine things.
It's late.
You'll think ofnumberten
for me, won'tyou?
Good night, Opal.
PREACHER: She couldstick a tire
in the groundandgrow a car.
Burned everything.
Even water.
She knew
all the constellations.
She hated bein'
a preacher's wife.
It made her feel like a bug
under a microscope.
OPAL: That night,
I went over and over in my head
the nine things
that the preacher had told me.
Then I wrote them down
just the way he had
said them to me.
That way, I would
never forget them.
Oh...
He shouldn't be away
from his mom too long
when they're this small.
What kind of tree is this?
It's a wait-and-see tree.
What's that mean?
It means you got to
wait till it grows up
beforeyou can
see what it is.
Tight?
Well?
MAN:
So you just drifted
on into town.
OTIS:
I told you everything.
Mornin', Otis.
Well, well, well.
How long you known
Mr. Otis, here?
Not so long, I guess.
So I reckon you
know Gertrude, too?
Yes, I do.
Winn-Dixie!
Yet somehow you don't
know Miss Gertrude.
Hmm?
Norwhy she'd
leave her shop
in the hands of a drifter.
Look, I told you
that we're cousins.
POLICEMAN:
You ain't no cousin
I know about, there, smiley.
I told you her mama's sick,
and I told you she asked me
to look after this store.
Well, aren'tyou
a big steamin'
pile of pancakes?
OTIS: Don'tyou have
anyone else's dayyou can ruin?
Why'd you come
in here, man?
Just leave me alone. God.
Well, well, well.
Somebody's all fired
up on budgie food.
Now, you.
We're gonna go outside
and have a little talk,
me and you.
Leave the girl alone.
Someone better shut
their gob-hole.
Come on, little one.
Getyou out ofthe presence
of... Mr. Ravioli over here.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Now, you don't
know so much
about that fellow
in there, doyou?
I know he can sing
near anything.
Oh, yeah, he can
sing, all right,
Iike a bird in a cage.
He tell you he
was locked up
in jail for a while?
I don't know anything
about that.
POLICEMAN: Mm-hmm.
The preacher knowyou'reworking here?
I didn't think so.
You just better
watch out.
Hey! Hey! Whoa!
Get away from there!
You are in violation
ofOrdinance 29-02:
the ramming of
a horny head
into a police-issued vehicle!
- Ow!
Don'tyou sass me,
you naughty goose!
Hey, Elvis! You stupid...
Ow!
Just, oh, get out here
and help me!
Get away, you freak!
Get away from me,
you hairy barnyard freaks!
Crazy wild goose on me!
Oh! 1 0-59!
Ah, I went through a stop sign!
- There's a goose! Help!
STEVI E:
You're such a goody-goody.
Shouldn't the
preacher's daughter
be at home
studying the Bible?
I saw you with
the police.
You're so busted.
That pet shop man
is a retarded criminal.
You don't know anything.
I know Preacher...
wouldn't likeyou hanging
around... with criminals.
Lay offher, Stevie.
I don't care whatyou guys say.
- Go pickyour lice,
you booger-eaters!
Dang, Opal.
GLORIA:
Babygirl, how 'bout telling me a story?
OPAL: Once upon a time,
I hated the Dewberryboys.
The end.
Oh, stop that nonsense.
I do hate 'em.
They're ignorant.
They thinkyou're a witch.
Oh, they're just trying
to get your attention.
I'll bet they likeyou.
Gloria, you know Otis?
No, I don't know Otis,
but I do know
whatyou told me about him.
You know he's a criminal?
He's been in jail.
Baby girl, come on.
I want to show
you somethin'.
See this tree?
- Yeah.
- Hmm?
OPAL:
Why are all those bottles on it?
GLORIA:
To keep the ghosts away.
What ghosts?
Ghosts of all the things
I've done wrong.
You did
that many things wrong?
More than that, baby girl.
But you're not
a bad person.
Doesn't mean
I haven't done bad things.
But there's whiskey
bottles on there,
a-and beer bottles.
That's right.
I know that.
I'm the one what drank
what was in 'em,
and I'm the one
what put 'em up there.
Oh, baby girl.
You know, a lot
offolks have problems...
with liquor and beer.
Get to start drinkin'
and can't get stopped.
Areyou one ofthose people?
Yes, I am...
butyou know somethin'?
These days, I don't drink
nothin' stronger
than coffee.
Did the whiskey
and beer and wine...
did they makeyou do all those
bad things that are ghosts now?
Some of'em.
Some of'em
I would've done anyway,
with orwithout the liquor
and the beer...
till I learned.
Learned what?
Till I learned what was
the most important thing.
What's that?
Oh... it's different
for everyone.
Got to learn
it on your own.
But, you know,
we should judge Otis
by the pretty music
that he makes
and how kind he is
to all them animals,
'cause that's all we know
about him now... right?
Yes, ma'am.
All right, then.
Miss Franny, I've got this
friend named Gloria Dump...
- Mm.
-...and she really loves to read,
only her eyes are bad,
so she can't read anymore.
- Ooh.
- So I was thinkin'
maybe I could read her
a story.
- Mm.
- Doyou have any suggestions?
Of course I have
suggestions.
Hmm. What about...
Gone with the Wind?
What's that about?
Oh, it's a wonderful,
exciting story
about the Civil War.
The Civil War?
Now, Opal,
don't tell me
you have never heard
ofthe Civil War.
It was the war
between the North
and the South
over slavery.
MISS FRANNY:
That's right, Opal.
My great-grandfather,
Littmus W. Block,
fought in that war.
I'm ready for another book.
Well, Amanda, maybeyou
wouldn't mind waitin'.
I was just telling
India Opal a story
about my great-grandfather.
I sure would like
to hear a story
aboutyour great-grandfather.
MISS FRANNY:
Now, Littmus, onlya boyof 14,
went offto be a hero,
but he soon found out
the truth.
What truth?
That war is hell.
Pure hell.
"Hell" is a cuss word.
MISS FRANNY:
Well, "war" is a cuss word, too.
I mean, nei-neither
ofyou can imagine...
Littmus was hungry
all the time.
He was covered
with all manner ofvermin.
Fleas and lice.
And hewas constantly
being shot at.
He suffered in a waythat no boy
should ever have to suffer,
and it changed him.
Shoot, I can't see nothin'.
There probably
ain't nothin' to see.
Come on, Dunlap.
You got to think
like a secret agent.
You got to think
like a spy.
He walked back home
when the warwas over.
I mean, he walked from Virginia
all the way to Georgia,
but when he got there,
his parents, his sisters,
everything
and everyone was gone.
AMANDA: But, Miss Franny,
what about his sisters?
- What happened to them?
- Dead.
Dead from typhoid fever.
And his mama?
Dead, too.
And his father?
He died on the battlefield.
People are dying
all over the place.
This guy's whole family's dead!
STEVI E:
Come on, I wanna hear.
So, Littmus was
an orphan?
Yes. Poor Littmus was
all alone in the world.
Well...
when he finished crying, he...
had the s-strangest sensation.
He wanted something sweet.
He wanted
a piece of candy.
Yes, ma'am.
Littmus W. Block figured
that the world
was a sorry affair
and had enough ugly things in it.
And what he was going to do
was put something sweet in it.
STEVIE:
Let me see.
Would you care
for a Littmus lozenge?
- Yes, Miss...
- Yes, please.
Thankyou.
Now, they're
not made anymore.
The world, it seems,
Iost its appetite
for Littmus lozenges.
Fortunately,
I had the foresight
to save a few.
Do you like it?
OPAL:
Yes, ma'am.
What aboutyou, Amanda?
Yes, ma'am, but it
makes me feel sad.
There is a secret
ingredient in there.
What is it?
Sorrow.
Not everybody can taste it.
I taste it.
Me, too.
Well, then...
you've probably both had
your share of sadness.
The world has changed so much.
People in Naomi, they-they used
to know each other's sadnesses.
They used to rely on each other.
This town just isn't the same
without the candy factory.
But how do you get sadness
into a piece of candy?
Yeah, how'd you get
that taste in there?
That is the mystery.
That's how Littmus made
his fortune.
By manufacturing a candy
that tasted sweet and sad
at the same time.
Man, we missed out
on the candy.
Now they're just
sitting around,
talking about
how they feel.
Come on.
I had to move away
from Watley...
and leave all
my friends behind.
That's one sadness
I've known.
And my mama.
I don't know my mama.
I only know a few
things about her.
And there's something the
preacherwon't tell me.
( voice breaking ):
It makes me think ofCarson.
STEVI E:
Hey, guys.
Bookworms!
Where's your apples?
I have to go.
STEVI E:
What's with her?
Who's Carson?
Carson was
Amanda's brother.
Was?
He drowned last year.
I saw the whole thing.
Come on, Dunlap.
OPAL: Gloria said that Naomi
was like one big mistake tree.
And everyperson
was its own bottle,
hanging in the wind,
all empty and alone.
Miss Franny thought
it had been that way
ever since the candy factory
closedyears ago.
People lost more
than theirjobs.
They lost each other.
T astes I i ke m usic.
I t rem i nds me of, uh...
bei ng i n jai l.
Otis, what were you in jail for?
You don't have to tell me.
I was just wondering.
I never hurt anybody.
Never meant to.
But I 've been locked up.
And I remember the day
very well.
I was sitting
in the park,
playing a little music.
And there were people
walking their dogs,
and children
were laughing.
Itwas a perfect day, so I...
felt like playing music.
I put my...
I put my hat out there,
but I wasn't really playing
for money.
I just thought that maybe
if someone was enjoying it,
they might throw
a little change in there.
Or not. I just...
Well, music is better
if somebody's listening.
Anyway, this...
...this policeman
came up to me.
He said I was disturbing
the peace.
And then he tried to take
my guitar away from me.
And I guess I got
real angry at him.
But I'm not a bad man.
I'm just...
¡Ó Not a lucky man ¡Ó
Anyway, they told me that I
broke that policeman's nose.
And they charged me with
assault on a police officer.
And no matterwhat I said,
theywouldn't listen.
No matterwhat I said,
theywouldn't...
They gave me
threeyears.
I said I'm...
not a bad man; I'm just...
¡Ó Not a lucky man... ¡Ó
Butyou. When I...
when I look at you...
¡ÓYou are like a butterfly ¡Ó
¡Ó A caterpillar's dream to fly ¡Ó
¡ÓTo bust out
ofthis old cocoon ¡Ó
¡Ó And dryyourwings off ¡Ó
¡Ó Butterfly ¡Ó
¡Ó Go ahead and fly... ¡Ó
OPAL:
Iswept the floorrealslow that day.
I wanted to keep Otis company.
I didn't want him to be lonely.
Sometimes it seemed to me
Iike everybody
in the whole world was lonely.
Yuck.
That tastes bad.
That tastes I i ke
not havi ng a dog.
OPAL:
I wondered ifmy mama-
wherever she was-
was lonely for me.
Thinking about her was the same
as the hole you keep on feeling
with your tongue
afteryou lose a tooth.
Time after time, my mind kept
on going to that empty spot.
The spot where I felt
like she should be.
Ooh, here, here!
BOY:
Get back i n your spots.
BOY 2:
Okay.
STEVI E:
Stri ke one.
What do you think?
Shall we give some
to the boys?
Yeah, but they haven't been
very nice.
They neverwant to playwith us.
Try this one, Dunlap.
Winn-Dixie!
I got it! I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
Whoa!
There he is! Get him!
BOY:
Just get him!
Get the ball!
Help me! Help me, Dunlap!
BOY:
Here comes the sheriff.
What in the name of corn on
the cob is goin' on around here?
Have we got
a situation here, fellas?
No, sir.
They're just all playin'.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Keep away from me!
Oh!
Get off of me!
- Off!.
Get off of me, you hairy,
heavy-metal hound dog!
Ow! Give me my pants back!
Oh! That's a wedgie!
This whole town's
gone mad!
Look, he has chicken legs!
I suppose you think
this is funny?
Don't look at that!
He wasn't trying to hurt you.
He just wanted
to give you a candy.
You little sea-monkeys.
But I'm gonna see you
in sea-monkeyjail.
I better put it in drive.
What's wrong?
You all right?
Oh, Winn-Dixie!
How many did you eat of these?
Oh! Oh, that's gross!
Oh, Winn-Dixie, ew!
PREACH ER:
Opal, I hope you don't have
that dog in your bed.
Daddy?
Opal...
it's 2:00 in the morning.
What are you doing up?
Daddy, are you hungry?
You lookin'
for somethin' to eat?
Yeah, that's it.
I'm hungry.
Try this.
What's this?
A Littmus lozenge.
Doyou like it?
Candy tastes melancholy.
What's melancholy?
Sad.
It's supposed to taste sad.
Makes me think
ofyour mother.
Doyou think
about her a lot?
I do, Opal.
Daddy...
did she drink?
Opal, there's some things
you're just too
young to understand.
I-I understand a lot ofthings.
I know about people
with drinkin' problems.
Gloria Dump had
a drinking problem.
I want to understand.
Yeah, I don't
even understand
what happened
with your mama.
We were happy,
I know that,
for a long time.
Well, it seemed like a
long time, we were happy.
But then she
started drinkin'.
She started drinkin'...
and that's the tenth thing?
But it's more
complicated than that.
Did she drink
because I was bad?
Was it my fault
that she left?
No. No! No!
It's notyour fault.
Don't... don't ever
say it's your fault.
Don't ever say that.
Do you hear me?
Yes, sir.
OPAL: I thought about how life
was like a Littmus lozenge,
how the sweet and the sad
were all mixed up together...
and how hard it was
to separate them out.
He was so angry.
Wel l...
He was hurtin',
that's why.
Everybody's hurtin'.
Makes me feel sad.
I want to help 'em, but I
just don't know what to do.
Well... don't dwell
on it, child.
Why don't we see what Miss
Scarlett's doin', hmm?
I believe she's gettin'
ready for that party.
That's what we need to do!
"We" who?
We- me and you!
We should have a party!
Don't you thinkwe should have
a party, Winn-Dixie?
We can invite
Miss Franny Block...
- No, Opal!
-...and the preacher and Otis.
Opal, don't go
in there!
Come on, we need
to start plannin'.
GLORIA:
No!
Wow, it's dark in here.
GLORIA:
Hold on, now, hon...
Opal?
Opal, wh-where areyou?
Doyou see?
- Don't, don't...
- That's a lot better.
Close those cur...
- Come on.
- Stop it!
You cannot have
any party here!
I haven't had folks
in here foryears.
Just make sandwiches.
And Otis can bring
his guitar.
I said no, and that's
the end ofit.
Miss Franny said the problem
with people here
is that they forgot
how to share their sadness,
but what I think is that people
forgot how to share theirjoy.
Oh, Winn-Dixie, oh...
Gloria, we need this party.
Please?
Oh, Lord.
This child.
Well, ifwe're
gonna have a party...
this house needs
a big pick up
ifwe gonna have folks over.
Whee! We're having a party!
We're gonna have a party,
and don'tyou forget to
invite them Dewberry boys.
Thankyou, Opal!
Thanks.
You're welcome.
GLORIA:
Fruit.
Oh!
Winn-Dixie!
You're gonna come, right?
Yeah, I-I'll be there.
Should be done with
prayer group by then.
We're havin' a party,
and you're invited.
You don't have to thank me.
It was Winn-Dixie's idea.
Come on, Winn-Dixie.
Come on.
MR. ALFRED:
Little miss?
He don't howl so much anymore.
He's not so lonely anymore.
Come on.
I
Mr. Alfred, you're one
ofthe first people here.
Well, there's no sense in
dilly-dallying, you know?
Hello, Opal.
Hi, Miss Franny.
Mr. Alfred,
doyou know Miss Franny?
No.
Miss Franny. Hello.
Nice to meetyou.
I brung dog pictures
for the theme ofthe party.
Oh! That's great,
Sweetie Pie.
Let me showyou.
Come on, Winn-Dixie.
Oh, wow,
they're beautiful!
AMANDA:
Hey, Opal.
Oh, hey, Amanda!
I'm so glad you could come.
Thankyou for
inviting me.
Oh, thanks for comin'.
- Hey, Winn-Dixie.
- Hold on.
Okay.
Gloria!
Gloria! Gloria.
GLORIA:
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
I'm comin', baby girl.
Don't rush me.
Please don't rush me.
I'm so nervous.
I haven't done this
in such a long time.
It's okay.
You look beautiful.
Well, thankyou for my
hair and myfingernails.
And you look pretty, too.
You wearin' that
necklace I gaveyou?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, everything is
so beautiful, Opal.
I can see it.
I can just see it.
Hi, Gloria.
Who's that?
Oh, Gloria, I'd likeyou
to meet my new friend, Amanda.
Amanda.
What a beautiful name.
- I'm glad you came.
- Thankyou.
- Come on.
- Me, too.
Come on. And this is
Miss Franny Block.
Hello, Gloria.
I've heard all aboutyou.
I hopeyou're enjoying
Gone with the Wind.
Oh... thankyou.
- You're welcome.
- And that's Mr. Alfred.
Miss Gloria,
I'm delighted to meetyou.
GERTRUDE:
Gertrude's a pretty bird.
MR. ALFRED:
I had no idea all this was back here.
- Hello.
- Hey, Otis!
Otis. Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
It's all right.
It's just a few people.
Hardly any people at all.
I brought pickles.
Pickles.
Have a pickle.
Oh! That's just exactly
what we needed.
They'll go perfectly
with the egg salad sandwiches.
Oh, Gertrude's a
pretty bird!
- Oh.
Miss Franny, this is Otis.
Oh! Oh!
What happened?
What happened?
The-the pickles fell.
It's a pleasure
to shake your hand, Otis.
Thankyou.
I brought pickles.
Yes, I see. It's nice.
Oh, and this
is Gloria Dump.
I brought pickles
for the party.
I'm glad you did.
I mean, wouldn't have been
no partywithout pickles.
Now, I've been
to several parties with no pickles.
A-And not one of
'em was any fun.
Otis, you can put
the pickles down right over here.
Thankyou, ma'am.
Baby girl, what happened
with the Dewberry boys?
And where's the preacher?
Uh, I don't know.
Well, I told 'em what
time we're startin'.
GERTRUDE:
Uh-oh.
Look at that dog
and look at that bird!
- Oh, no! Winn-Dixie!
No, Winn-Dixie!
Get down! Get down!
Winn-Dixie, come on.
Well, ifwe don't eat soon,
there won't be any food left.
I thinkyou're right.
Let's just hold hands and...
give thanks for this.
Opal, give meyour hand.
Winn-Dixie, sit.
Dear Lord
and Heavenly Father,
we have egg salad sandwiches,
we got Dump's punch,
we got pickles,
we got doggy pictures,
and we have
Littmus lozenges,
but, more importantly,
Dear Lord, we have good friends.
Dear Lord, we got
good friends to share
this warm summer night with us,
and, for that,
we're grateful.
Teach us, dear Lord,
to love one another.
This we ask in Your name.
Amen.
ALL:
Amen.
SWEETI E PI E:
Are we fixin' to eat now?
I thinkwe might
want to eat inside.
It's not supposed to rain.
MISS FRANNY:
Oh! Oh, my God.
Nobody said rain.
It didn't pred...
Get the sandwiches!
Get the punch!
I got the plates!
Somebody get the punch!
Get the sandwiches!
Pickle?
Oh, yes, I'm cleaned up
real good, now.
Did you get
the sandwiches?
Somebody get
the sandwiches?
Yeah. They're
all wet, Gloria.
- And the punch?
- Yeah.
GERTRUDE:
Get the sandwiches?
Uh-oh.
Pickles. Pickles. Pickles.
Comin' down.
- Can I talk toyou, please?
- Oh, sure.
GERTRUDE:
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Opal, you worked real hard. I...
I brought this foryou.
I figured you'd earned it.
Oh! Thanks, Otis.
Dog! Dog! Dog!
Don't worry.
I got them dog pictures.
I got 'em right here.
Winn-Dixie!
Winn-Dixie!
Oh, no!
Winn-Dixie!
He's scared ofthunder!
Winn... Winn-Dixie.
No, Winn-Dixie, no!
Opal, no, no, no.
- No, no!
- Look, he's probably outside
under the chair.
We'll take the
flashlight and go look.
No, no!
- I forgot to hold onto him!
- Opal! Opal!
Opal, take the flashlight.
Opal!
Opal! Uh...
Winn-Dixie!
GLORIA:
You can't see!
Come back!
Opal! Opa...
Dewberry boys.
You got all wet. Opal!
No, Winn-Dixie!
Opal, your guests are here!
Opa...
Opal, your guests
are here.
I don't care!
Now, you come up here
right this minute!
Come right up here!
Now, let me
tell you somethin'!
This is your party,
and I wantyou
to tell these boys
how glad you are
that they came.
Thankyou for comin'
to my party.
It's just I got to find
Winn-Dixie.
You want me to help?
Listen...
Opal...
you cannot hold onto anything
that wants to go.
Doyou understand
what I'm sayin'?
You just got to love it
whileyou got it,
and that's that.
I just got to find him!
Opal, wait
till the rain stops!
Opal!
Opal...
Winn-Dixie!
Winn-Dixie!
Is he here?!.
Who?
Winn-Dixie! He's gone!
He ran away
because ofthe storm,
and I can't find him!
Come on in out
ofthe rain, Opal.
Come on!
We were at the party,
and you were supposed
to be there!
And you weren't,
and now he's gone!
Opal.
Op...!
Opal!
Come back here!
Opal!
Here, take your raincoat.
We'll look for him together.
Winn-Dixie!
Winn-Dixie?
I'll write a list
often things about him.
Thatway, people'll know him
ifthey see him.
We'll find him, Opal.
One: He has a pathological fear
ofthunderstorms.
Two: He likes to smile
at everyone he meets.
Three:
He likes going to church.
Four: He snores.
Five: He can catch mice
without squishing 'em to death.
Number six.
Number six is he likes
to meet people.
Number seven: He sure does like
peanut butter.
I
Number eight: He can 't stand
to be left alone.
Nine: He likes to sit on
couches and sleep in beds.
Number ten is... he was a dog
who knew how to be a friend.
I kept on goin ' over and over
that list in my head,
the same way I did
with the list
often things about my mama.
Wi nn-Dixie!
I memorized it
so ifl didn't find him,
I'd at least have
some part ofhim to hold onto.
Wi nn-Dixie!
I t's gettin' late, Opal.
You're gettin' tired.
We need to head back.
But, Daddy,
he's out there.
We can't leave him.
Well, there's only
so much lookin' we can do.
You're gonna give up.
Opal...
You give up on everything.
That's not true.
It is true.
All you do is give up.
Just pull your head
back insideyour stupid
turtle shell and give up.
You won't talk.
You won't go
to parties.
And I betyou didn't
even go out lookin'
for my mama when she left.
I betyou just let her
run off, too.
I couldn't stop her.
I tried.
I... No, loo... I tried.
You don't think
I wanted her to stay, too?
She was everything to me.
- You didn't try.
- Yes, I did.
She wasn't everything toyou.
Yes, she was.
Opal, she was everything.
Everything. I f...
I failed her, all right?
I failed her.
I failed her, Opal.
I tried and I t...
- You didn't try!
- I tried and I tr...
- I knowyou didn't.
- I tried.
I did. I tried
and I tried and I tried
with everything I am.
It's my fault.
Opal... it's all my fault.
I'm sorry.
Daddy...
I ju...
And don't... don't believe
losing Winn-Dixie
isn't gonna upset me
as much as it does you.
I love that dog.
I love him, too.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you, too.
Daddy...
do you think Mama
will ever come back?
No. No, I don't, Opal.
I've hoped and prayed and
dreamed about her comin' back.
I don't think
it's gonna happen.
Gloria told me thatyou can't
hold onto anybody...
thatyou can only love what
you got whileyou've got it.
Gloria Dump is a wise person.
But I'm not ready
to let Winn-Dixie go.
Well, we'll keep on lookin'.
Opal...
doyou remember
when I told you
thatyour mama took everything
with herwhen she left?
Yes, sir.
Well, there's one
very important thing
she left behind.
What?
You.
Thank God your mama left meyou.
Did you find him?
No.
Notyet. We haven't
found him yet.
We went looking, too.
We drove all over.
MISS FRANNY:
I'm sorry, Opal.
We just drove
all over town.
I had a dog once that wandered
all over the place.
And?
And... when he got
through wanderin'...
he came home.
Don't worry, Opal.
He'll come back.
He's got to.
