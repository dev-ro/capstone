May I hold your hand?
No, you are very ugly.
What happened?
My finger got stuck.
You can do better!
Play.
But no!
What is going on there?
I do not like the piano.
I'm not interested in music.
Why do I have to do it?
Just do it.
Play!
Play.
Interesting read?
It is about cowboys.
Mom... Yes?
Can I have a revolver?
You're crazy!
Not a real, a toy.
No.
War is not a game.
Play the piano.
I want a gun.
There are Hitler's soldiers everywhere
and you want a gun?
It's not fair that I pay
for your problems with Hitler.
Buy me a gun and play the piano.
No.
What are you doing?
Just looking.
You are not just looking!
You are touching everything
with your stinking fingers.
What do you want?
Nothing, ma'am.
Get out of here.
The day of Glory has arrived!
Against us, tyranny
The bloody standard rose
The bloody standard rose
Did you hear in the fields...
A slaughter of our sons and sisters!
Blood, blood is everywhere!
Blood, blood is everywhere!
Very well Brochaut.
Smoking while on duty...
...And perverting youth, Bravo!
But it was he who gave me a smoke.
What are you doing here before opening?
It's for the lad.
He wants...
...his star.
If you were late on a day like this...
...you will be ashamed all your life.
Tell me...
Who do you think you are?
I'm Lucien Ginsburg
I'm a Jew.
My father is a pianist at the nightclub.
You are in a hurry to use it?
It is your star. It is you who
want us to carry it.
You are very disrespectful.
Why are you not in school?
I left school. I'm in academy of
painting in Montmartre.
The academy of painting in Montmartre?
See you...
If they accept trash like you...
...it can't be very good!
You should not talk like that.
Some people are very good at
Academy Montmartre.
For example, the SS general
Karl Heinz van Mayer.
He likes me very much.
Even offered me a biscuit.
What do you say?
I can present you to him.
It may be good for your career.
What are you drawing?
An adventure...
About a small piano player
to whom everybody say:
We don't want to see your face!
And he had no more work.
Even in the bars they shouted
"we don't want to see your face."
And as more they shouted
as bigger the face grows.
He could't do anything about it.
It just grew enormous.
And made his life a living hell.
He couldn't get away from it.
So he wanted to make it even bigger
and blew his cheeks.
So...
Plop!
His voice exploded.
- He died?
- No.
It changed to something...
...completely different.
Professor Flipus.
Who is that?
A scary man. But very elegant.
So the people love him.
They love him like
the ogres of Grimm's tales.
They love to hate him.
And when the piano plays all are silent.
And what is he playing?
What women want, he is a seducer.
Sorry. We are going to sleep.
No, continue.
You play better at nights.
I came to to ask for permission,
I have to leave Paris soon.
I won't be able to come more.
I would like to take with me
a picture of you.
There are many models...
But I always wait your turn.
Would you like to pose for me?
I may become a great painter.
- May I get dressed
Mr. Big Artist?
- Not really.
- Go...
It's not the clothes.
If you are moving I can not work.
I'll stand like that?
- No.
- What?
This is the bra.
I don't know how to draw it.
Should I take it off?
Why do you obey?
Because it took you nerve to ask.
I'm very shy.
At last here is a guy who can talk
but he is so small!
I can't tell you where I'm going.
But I will write love letters.
And you will loose your heart.
What will you write me?
Perhaps something of Baudelaire.
Perhaps my poems.
You won't know the difference.
- Write then.
- No.
When the war is over I will find you.
I'll be very old.
No, I still will like you.
I think not.
I'll seduce women who look like you.
What a pretty girl!
I'm a boy!
Forgive me, little one.
You have a nice mom.
She's my model.
I am a painter.
What is going on?
It is Fr
Madame Fr
Well, I messed up...
May I offer you a drink.
So you excuse me.
What do you think about it...
Ducon...?
He is...
is my model too.
My little model.
Waiter!
Bring us some lemonade.
I also had a son.
But with my profession...
I could not take care of him...
I took him to a poor nursery
where they let him starve.
You my little,
are you dying from hunger.
Do not touch my dogs.
They are dangerous.
I know one of your songs.
- From start to finish? Formidable!
Come on, sing!
It is the blue silk?
The...
- No.
- It's not that?
All the children sing the blue silk.
I do not
my song is "Cocaine"
But this song is not for children!
There is no right age to be a fool.
The orchestra is playing
a brilliant tango
In my arms was my beloved
And in my hand I took a knife
And my revenge was cruel
I was sad, I was a fool
Murdered my gigolo
In front of his companions,
in his heart I put my knife
Give me some coke
to cloud my head...
Give me some coke
to cloud my head...
Your governess is Miss Laxe.
You'll get along with her.
We have a choir.
Every Wednesday afternoon.
The priest takes care of that.
He is very gentle.
You are in the country.
Here everything is calmer.
She has tits...
Can you draw more hair?
Not enough?
Not in the pussy, in the armpits.
I really like.
You're real peasants here!
You too!
Not bad. You draw quite well.
Can you draw Paulette Dubost naked?
The Germans are coming.
With that face you are lost.
Take this ax, go to the forest.
If they see you say you are
woodcutter's son...
...You pick up the branches.
Take.
Come. We must hide.
We have a cabin like in
The Last of the Mohicans.
Without fire to not attract the enemy.
Lucien!
What do they do here?
You left without eating.
We brought you sausage.
You did well to hide.
They checked everywhere looking for Jews.
Why do you say that to me?
It is not my business.
Why do you hide then?
I have an appointment.
It's a secret.
Get going. She is coming.
She?
When I have an appointment
I'm dating a girl.
How to think I learned...
...to draw that pussy hair?
Lucien, I am cold
I waited a long time.
Forgive me for having made you wait.
Today I have to make you sit nude.
You didn't write me a lot.
No.
But I draw you every day.
Could you undress?
I'm naked.
I am a little cold.
I can curl up with you?
If you want.
Lucien, I feel so good.
You want to marry me?
No doubt honey.
Kiss me on the mouth with your tongue.
Well, if you insist.
Then you will have to pose.
I'm not paying you for nothing.
Yes.
Tell me a poem, it's turning me on.
Your eyes, do not reveal
Neither sweet nor bitter,
They are two cold jewels
made of gold and steel.
To see you walking in cadence,
makes me forget everything
It seems a snake dancing
to the tune of a cane.
Under the burden of your slumber
Your child's head
Is nodding with the softness
of a baby elephant.
And your body bends and stretches
like a fine ship
That rolls and dips
His oars in the water.
As the wave swells from
thawing glaciers
When the saliva from your mouth
rolls down your teeth,
I want to drink wine of Bohemia
Bitter and conquering
A liquid sky that scatters
Stars in my heart!
How nice!
Baudelaire in the morning.
I arrived too early?
At dawn, the light is beautiful.
Undress.
Why?
I'm not a model.
Excuse me, in that case...
I stay dressed for now.
Understood. May I help you to settle in.
A good site.
The light coming from the left.
May I?
That's perfect.
Done.
You always rise so early?
I do not sleep.
I play the piano.
Me too. - Ah!
What are you playing?
Bach.
Ah, yes. I do not.
I play in a piano bar.
I have no ambition in this field.
It is only to...
buy paint.
Where do you play?
I would like to go to listen.
You'd rather not.
I can not prohibit.
And if you do not say where?
Ah!
Then it will be more fun.
I'll find out.
And if you forbid it?
It will be even better.
I'll follow you in secret.
I'm not a jukebox!
You are makeing fun of me?
It is because you have blue eyes
your hair is exploding in the sun
Like a burst of fire
It is because
you are 20.
You are chewing life like a red fruit
that is torn from a tree, laughing...
Is it yours?
Aznavour.
You think everything is permitted...
...that comes in your your head.
Grieving for a moment
ready to start again.
You play with my heart
...Like a spoiled child
requiring a toy
to reduce it to crumbs.
Strange - canvases of the master
scattered all around!
Yes.
Hang those that are yours.
He spends all evenings searching
his name in the newspapers.
If there is no single
word about Salvador Dali...
it gets him mad.
I do the same.
But my name never appears.
It is a tragedy.
Absolutely.
I can not draw you.
But I'm very easy to draw.
Yes.
But...
I want to kiss you.
So I can not concentrate.
Well...
How do you think Klimt worked?
Drawing irresistible girls...
sticking their fingers in various places.
And yet his drawings are accurate.
With perfect lines.
I do not know.
I'm excited even when you are dressed
Ah.
Lucien...
Yes?
I guess...
Klimt...
made love before drawing.
I'll Finish later.
Not in the bed of Dali.
I would not dare in the bed of Dali.
Elisabeth, I can not sleep.
Count animals.
Think of an animal that soothes you.
Perhaps a panda.
Imagine a fat panda
crossing bamboo grove...
and disappearing.
Now think of a second panda...
he looks at you.
And disappears.
A third...
So many pandas distress me.
Somebody is talking in my head.
When I'm not writing or drawing...
he speaks even more...
I do not know how to get rid of him.
It is not me.
It is another voice.
Yes.
You are owned by the devil.
Some are.
They have it inside.
Do not laugh!
But "devil" means double
It's something to talk to.
All the great minds has a devil.
How do I sleep then?
Listen.
Stop the painting and all nonsense.
I'll bring you luck.
But I love the painting.
Elisabeth what do you say...
She is sound asleep.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Treat yourself.
I am your face.
Do not you recognize your dirty face?
You've grown.
You have become disgusting.
What do you want from me?
I have something to propose you.
Who are you talking to?
With my face. It's nothing.
Elisabeth I can not sleep.
So you woke me up.
All the world's problems?
You would not understand.
I'm possessed by the devil.
Certainly!
If we make love will you sleep?
Eh?
Well, Me too.
But seriously...
I think I need an exorcism.
Oh yeah?
Wait...
I'm very good at it.
Show me.
You know Yiddish folklore?
A little. And a bit of Russian.
And jazz.
Please mind your manners
and no silly jokes.
Children are very fragile.
They are sick? Nobody told me.
The parents of tees kids...
It is difficult to describe these children.
Sometimes they are like petrified.
This is not for me. Sorry.
Perhaps you could try?
Just for today, help me out.
Come on.
Let
Go!
I'm Lucien, take the instruments.
Let's see what you have learned.
Now you.
No, I...
I'm lost when I have to improvise.
Do you play the piano like your father!
I changed the chords of Django...
Django could not write music.
And then?
He was looking at his guitar.
Just watch the guitar...
and tell a story.
It's that simple.
With words?
No, only with notes.
In minor?
Django did not know chords and notes.
But knew how to play music.
See you next week?
About the guitar...
Go!
You work day and night.
And show me in a week.
Ready...
Would you like to play
like Django Reinhardt?
He plays with two fingers.
The rest...
is not not needed.
The rest...
you can sacrifice.
Look... with only two fingers.
Shit!
That's right.
It is necessary to sacrifice
some things.
I told you to stop painting.
And look...
how it all ended.
Have you seen your wife?
What about her? I like her.
No.
You liked her before.
You're a bastard.
It is a Rubens, she looks like a hippo.
With a "D" like a "marshmallow"
And as regards to hippolady
It's because I get everything in bulk
Oh, what suspense my hippolady
With a "D" like in "relax"
The springs creak under my hippolady
but it I feels good on your skin
This is no small thing
This hippolady
With a "D"
As in "Gigolo"
When I am with my hippolady...
I'm hustling for him
I sell everything about everything
And if you are a failure
You can say I'm a hot female
The tricks don't move me
my heart belongs to Antoine only
my feeling is so deep
that only he has made to the bottom
Antoine, the fanatic.
With me he is not so cocky
I'm your girl
I'm your girl.
Antoine is my true love.
Bravo!
The creation of Lucien Ginsburg.
It smells of success?
I'm going back to painting.
Stop the nonsense.
Oh, Boris Vian.
It's your opportunity...
he has come to listen.
I told him I'm singing your songs.
Just heard your last song.
Fine. Keep it that way, buddy.
Once upon a time a wooden leg
Was looking for an owner
She said: "If in fact
nobody loves me,
I do not care if I get
a bullet in the heart"
Arrived on the battlefield
faced the machine guns
later met a cannonball
whistling at full blast
She said "My friend, I like your mouth
Before you kill the Cossacks
be friend and make a detour...
before leaving for the attack.
But the problem is
I do not like the peasants.
And so I need your help,
dodge the Cossacks,
find me that French officer.
It's too bad.
Shut up!
If you can severe his leg,
and gangrene won't kill him
I'll be his trusted wooden leg
Formidable.
But I...
I need not think a little...
About what?
My stage presence.
Ah, yes, yes.
That bothers you.
Yes.
You dance awfully.
I never dance.
In addition I have an ugly face.
No.
No.
Not so ugly.
You want to be run over.
No, just waiting a taxi.
Somebody has to stop.
May I wait with you?
Of course.
The street belongs to everyone.
I have a double that follow me.
I believe that.
You have one too?
It's a werewolf.
I am nothing without him.
Ah.
All the singers have one?
All the poets...
- What do you do?
- We wait for a taxi.
Perhaps you can give us a lift?
"Freres Jacques" already are with me.
I love them.
Look.
Everyone is here.
Grumpy.
Simpleton.
Happy
And? - Sleepy.
Sleepy.
I'm drinking
Systematically
To forget the friends of my wife
I'm drinking, systematically
To forget all my miseries
I'm drinking too much
I see pink elephants
Spiders on the waistcoat
of my smoking jacket
Bats in the roof
of the lounge
Salon.
I'm drinking...
in my spare time
for not to see my face.
I'm drinking without fun
for not to remind me
that it's time to quit.
- For love...
- I'm drinking...
And even more
Always...
- I'm drinking...
Those pink elephants
Spiders on my waistcoat
Systematically
Bats hanging from the ceiling
All my troubles
- I'm drinking...
- I'm drinking...
I'm drinking...
I'm drinking
Coffee? A sandwich?
What time is it?
We are always on time.
Breakfast for the pianist!
Incredible.
We are real athletes...
our muscles are in the service of the song.
I presumed the dance is only for a scene
This profession asks
for complete dedication.
You will learn it.
I'll have a fight with my girlfriend.
She won't believe
you fed me with sandwiches.
We need the audience to believe!
You don't know her. She's very jealous.
I have to go. Thank you.
You're not going anywhere.
You haven't paid.
I can not pay, I'm broke.
Then sing us something.
- Okay.
But quickly.
I'm an inspector in Les Lilas station
people are passing me by
without a glance
There is neither sun underground,
nor jokes about streetlights.
To kill the boredom
I have pages of Readers' Digest
Not bad.
Continue.
Where they write,
That people travel to Miami
while I'm minding my business
here under ground.
There is no worse job
than punching tickets in the cave.
And then?
I have to go.
Or my girlfriend will make noise.
Okay, you may go.
Just leave us the song...
Mister...?
Lucien Ginsburg.
Ah no, you should change it.
Your name sounds like hairdresser.
I'm an inspector in Les Lilas station
Arts-et-Metiers direction Levallois
I'm fed up working in this asshole
Just want to run away and
leave my cap on the nail
One fine day I shall run away
only God knows where
I'll hit the highway
whatever it takes
even if I had to be carried
with my feet first.
I'm punching holes, small holes,
then even smaller holes.
And smaller, and smaller
And the moment will come
when I'll take a gun
to make a hole, a last
small hole
the last smallest hole.
And then I'll be put in a big hole
where they don't know
...about holes, small holes...
Thank you, it was...
the first concert of Gainsburg.
Written and composed by...
...Serge Gainsbourg.
That's you?
Absolutely.
Wonderful.
I am a singer.
- Serge, we are going?
- Yes.
If you want a song...
write to my parents,
Chaptal street, Paris 9.
I'm an inspector in Les Lilas station
I don't see much art in it
My son is a star
A star
but every week he visits his parents.
And every time they say:
Your songs are trash.
Yes dad.
Anyway I'm proud.
I have several letters for you.
Give me them.
It is not my business...
but the envelopes are
so awfully adorned.
They don't look like business letters!
If your girlfriend will see them...
she'll het mad.
Mom?
What do I say if she finds them?
Mom dreams that you leave her.
But to leave and to be unfaithful...
May I read them?
You can read those.
Those I shall keep.
Why?
You have any secrets? - No.
Those are business.
Then why do you hide them?
Do not insist.
- It is human nature.
To Adam and Eva God gave
all the garden of Eden.
He forbade only one tree.
And that was the only thing
that interested them.
I know, dad.
And now God says:
Leave me be!
That's mother.
Hide them!
A family of idiots.
Lucien is here and nobody says me that.
I arrived just now.
Will you stay for dinner?
No.
I'll give you some borscht?
No thank you, your jars
usually get open and stain everything.
Take.
Why do I give it all to you
if your girlfriend throws it all out.
- How can you say that?
- Don't you know her.
Lucien.
Who is the girl who writes you?
You think I should tell you?
That concerns my work.
No, dad?
A singer?
I wont tell you.
Famous?
You won't guess.
Her name is Juliette Greco.
Who is Juliette Greco?
I don't want you to go to her.
You're exaggerating.
Exaggerating?
Do you know any wife driving
her husband to Greco in the night
because he doesn't have a licence?
Next time we'll take a taxi.
Go in, what are you waiting for?
Let me be.
I'll have to get my courage.
Go
Enter
- Shut up!
Do you want me to tell you?
I am right beside you.
If you want to seduce Greco,
go on.
But
I am going to sell my songs,
not to seduce Greco!
That is why she invited you
in the middle of the night
just to hear you sing?
Leave me be.
Mr. Gainsbourg,
please go to the hall...
...and wait.
I have a night off.
Shit!
Are you cleaning?
I have a maid to do it.
This is glass, you are barefoot...
you can get hurt.
The only hurt one here is you.
You like this painting?
Eh... no.
I could say that I like it...
...just to please you.
A rose. For whom?
I love your songs.
I love you.
Then we have something in common.
We love mutually.
Excuse me. I'm petrified.
I shall laugh...
behind the piano.
You have such a blue eyes
and your hair...
challenging the sun.
If I wanted to listen to Aznavour...
I wouldn't have invited you.
Eh...
It is called...
...La Javanaise.
I did not suffer for you
my love.
Before I heard of you.
Do not be so sad while
we are dancing La Javanaise
Our love will last
while lasts this song.
I like that.
How do you dance it?
I don't dance very well.
Let me?
Do not be so sad while
we are dancing La Javanaise
Our love will last
while lasts this song.
April usually gets me
in the mood for love.
Are you expecting somebody?
They are coming for you.
You're coming, Serge?
I wanted to see in you
this love
Do not be so sad while
dancing la Javanaise
Our love will last
while lasts this song.
You never sleep?
Never, Honey.
Come.
I'm not sleeping too.
I hear the voices in my head.
You too?
Hold me in your arms.
Come.
Serge, come?
Serge...
Coming?
Are we going back to Greco?
To Greco? Of course not!
Bring me to my parents.
She loves your songs.
My songs are on thing...
my face - another.
You are wrong.
I'll leave you with your parents
and go to Greco.
Not without me!
That is music!
Great!
You'll sell it three times!
Two to your parents...
and third to yourself.
Write to Johnny Hallyday.
I prefer to die.
- Then to Sheila?
- Leave me alone!
I do not write for adolescents.
For those rereading "Lolita"?
- That's different.
I like to corrupt minors.
Let's do it.
You have to give them what they want.
Just make one and another.
Make the poisoned apples.
Maybe so.
Have a 20 year old...
and make her into an object of scandal.
France Gall?
Ah, no.
I already have an appointment
with her father.
I won't go,
France Gall...
You know her father?
Mr Gainsbourg,
ready to see the eyes?
Easy money.
Don't be a cynic, you could be
popular and demanding.
The taste of youth is a mystery...
They like to be surprised.
Not always.
Smoke? - No.
Without dad watching?
It's a pity but I obey him.
You like my songs?
My dad likes them.
- This is not an answer.
- Yes!
He has a good taste.
Everybody likes the songs he choses.
You don't want to vomit of them?
Why?
A professor of painting
once told me...
if your parents like your work
then it is a piece of shit.
Wouldn't you like a dirty song?
No!
Look, it amazes you.
My songs are my work.
It is not to amaze me.
If my dad...
Let's hide something in there.
A story about a girl who loved lollypops.
And?
She is sucking them for money...
Is that for kids?
Honey.
Sing for us.
About love
you have your own ideas,
when you like it and when no
poor you
alone and abandoned
You'll wake up married
perhaps against your will
The wedding night
is too late to be sorry
Sing and dance Baby Pop
Like tomorrow Baby Pop
Won't exist Baby Pop
Will never come
Sing and dance Baby Pop
Like tomorrow Baby Pop
early in the morning Baby Pop
you are going to die
Magnificent! It's a hit!
You'll get rich
because of my daughter!
Stop the music.
I have a letter from the bank.
I sold my soul to the devil?
The good news is.
