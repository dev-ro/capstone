Encore! Uh, "The Summer Song."
He just played
"The Summer Song."
Well, play it again, then.
Or just any song with "summer"
in the title. Doesn't matter.
Uh, cheers, guys.
I'm gonna take a bit of a break
- and then I'll come back.
- Are you being serious?
That's it.
I can't believe I missed it.
Jack.
Sir.
How are you...
enjoying the job?
Yeah, not bad. Good, thanks.
I've noticed
the customers like you.
Okay, great. Yeah, well,
I try to be friendly.
Unlike me.
I'm increasingly finding
I don't like you.
- Right.
- You know, the beard
gets on my nerves.
What's wrong with shaving?
- Yeah, I know. I suppose I...
- Yeah...
And I don't like the way
you're always late.
I-I don't like the way
you dress.
And worse, I get the feeling
you think working here
is beneath you.
- Oh.
- But the customers like you.
So, if you want to
go full-time, you can.
Right.
Okay. Well, yeah, great.
Uh, let me think about that.
Or, eh, here's
the alternative, son.
Two weeks,
you're out on your ear.
Yeah. I'll give the job
to dozy Karen.
Okay, great.
Well, classic. Um...
- Yeah, I'll get right back to you.
- Good.
There's someone to see you.
Make it quick.
We've got stuff to sell.
Do you want the good news
or the bad news?
I'm gonna have to say
good news,
'cause I don't think I could
take any more bad news.
Well, the good news is
you're booked
for Latitude Festival.
No!
Yes! Yes!
It's not the biggest...
It's the,
it's the Suffolk Tent.
I don't care what tent,
it's Latitude!
It's a proper festival!
You are the best manager in the world!

Uh, yeah, it's been a blast.
I thought "Dinosaur"
was particularly strong.
Well, yeah, I got most of
the words right.
"Hear me roar,
- I'm a dinosaur."
- Rocky!
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, mate!
- Yeah!
- Oh!
- I'm a road manager, innit.
- Oh!
So everyone who said
that you were a lazy,
- useless, drug-taking drunk...
- Hello.
...who'd never get a job
were wrong.
Yes, they were, actually.
I'm in profitable employment.
A valued cog in
a well-oiled rock machine.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Good set, though, mate.
- Yeah.
- Did you hear it? I didn't see you.
I-If I'm totally honest,
I only popped by for
a quick bong behind the tent.
- Oh.
- But it was a lovely surprise to hear you.
I mean,
I didn't hear much of it,
to be honest, 'cause...
of the bong and stuff,
but... yeah.
Ah, you're still making sweet
love to young Ellie, I see.
- No.
- No.
No, never. Not once.
That's a shame.
She's my manager.
Hey, do you wanna come
backstage for our gig?
- Wha... Please.
- Yeah?
Let's do it, then.
- Let's rock this road.
- All right.
So how long you been
back in Suffolk?
Oof. Well, I'm trying to live
outside the traditional
concept of time.
So, could be weeks,
could me months,
could be a year and a half,
no idea.
Oh, here we are.
Thank you so much.
So what exactly do you do?
Make sure everything runs
like clockwork.
- Service the equipment.
- Right.
Make sandwiches, make teas.
Uh... Oh, Christ.
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry, Michael.
You're fired.
Fair do's.
Got fired.
Give Ellie one for me, yeah?
- No, really, we don't...
- Catch you later.
Oh, great day.
Yeah, great day.
Though, Elle,
we should stop now.
I can't do this anymore.
Don't be stupid.
You're gonna need
a bigger tent.
You're
gonna need a bigger tent.
No, okay, stop.
You gotta stop pretending
that we're in a thrilling story
with a big, exciting end.
We're in a little story
and it ends now.
I think I hear something
special in my songs,
you think you hear
something special,
and I love you for it.
But no one else does.
No one ever has.
Uh, Nick loves
"The Summer Song."
Nick is famously
a world-class moron.
If it hasn't happened by now,
it's not going to.
It'll take a miracle.
Miracles happen.
I mean it.
This is a serious moment
for me.
This is just absolutely
not happening.
Look, I can't be the star that
we thought I could be at 14,
on that day in the school hall
when I sang a pretty cool cover
of "Wonderwall"
and you were there, backstage.
- I'm not hearing a word.
- Okay, but look.
This, this was my last gig.
And I'm so happy
you were there.
This is the end of our long
and winding road.
Come on!
The world is full of miracles.
Like what?
Benedict Cumberbatch
becoming a sex symbol.
- Oh...
- You'll change your mind.
I won't. This is the start
of a better life.
And I'm...
feeling perky about it.
Mmm.
Night-night, rock star.
Yeah. Night-night.
You all right, mate?
Just a few minutes, okay?
Can I just say one thing?
Just to... warn you.
I've spoken with the doctor
and you,
you will walk again.
But you have lost your beard
and, um, two big teeth.
And even though
it should be sad,
it's actually very funny,
unfortunately.
So despite all the pain and inconvenience,
you're not even gonna get
any sympathy.
People will just laugh at you.
Ow.
What happened?
No one knows.
It was all over the world.
Electricity flicked off
for 12 seconds.
You were just unlucky
that at that exact moment,
a big bus hit you.
You know, the weird thing
they thought
was gonna happen at midnight
when we hit 2000?
- Oh, yeah, Y2K.
- It sort of happened.
It was very big news which,
um, you missed entirely.
- Because of the bus.
- Ah.
Mm-hmm.
Right. I've gotta
get back to school.
- Elle?
- Yeah?
Thanks for taking
such good care of me.
You're welcome.
I'll come back later.
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me,
when I'm 64?
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
- Why 64?
- What do you mean?
It's just... oh, forget it.
What do you mean, "Why 64?"
I think the accident
was a message from God.
Yeah, he was very angry.
Elle, you think
me getting hit by a bus
was God's way of telling me
not to go back to teaching?
Exactly.
Incredible. It's amazing.
You know, God loves your stuff.
Look, if God had been remotely
interested in my stuff,
he would've once,
right, just once,
had someone write me
a fan letter who wasn't my mum.
Or me.
Yeah.
I didn't ask
to be The Beatles,
you know, I just wanted once
to have a standing ovation
not given by people who were
already standing at the bar.
Be the what?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.
Carol, come and look!
I know Ellie said it was funny,
but no one mentioned visual
humor of this quality.
Jack! Oh, my God! Your teeth.
- Cheese!
- Oh, wow.
Presents, presents,
- presents. - Mm, presents, presents.
- Yes, yes.
It's true, we have
bought you presents.
- Exciting.
- Well, they have, obviously.
- Huge work week.
- Yeah, yeah.
What do we have here?
Okay, okay, okay.
- Uh, boom! Hey!
- Oh, wow.
- Because you lost your teeth. That's...
- Yeah, I know.
That's why that's funny. Okay.
- Number two.
- Where did you get that?
- 'Cause you got hit by a bus.
- Yeah, I remember.
Do you?
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.
All right. One more.
- I've signed your name, don't worry.
- One more, yes.
I don't know what this one
could possibly be.
- Oh, my... Neither do I.
- No idea.
I mean, I'm thinking some
sort of snow shovel.
- Mm-hmm.
- Or a... tiny little giraffe with no legs.
Just open it, open it, open it.
Oh.
Okay.
Wow.
'Cause yours got run over by a bus.
Well, play something.
- Yes, play something.
- Come on.
- Play "The Summer Song."
- Let me get rid of this.
Hey!
What's tickin' and tockin'
and rockin'?
- Yeah! - Oh!
- What is he doing here?
Yeah, he got sacked.
He's staying with us,
- sleeping on the sofa.
- That is a disaster
- that could last forever... Yep.
- Terrible decision.
- That's right.
- ...and ruin your entire life.
Absolutely.
Hey, really glad
you're not dead, man.
He's got a new guitar.
- He's gonna play a song.
- Ow. - ROCKY: Epic.
A great guitar
requires a great song.

- Oh.
- When did you write that?
I didn't write it.
Paul McCartney wrote it,
The Beatles.
Who?
The Beatles.

John, Paul, George
and Ringo, The Beatles.
Which beetles is this?
The insect beetles
or the car Beetles?
The pop group Beatles...
Nick, help me out here.
Right. Yes.
Um, there's this problem
with musicians.
They presume everyone else has
this encyclopedic knowledge
of obscure pop, make you
feel stupid when you haven't
heard of bands, you know,
like Neutral Milk Hotel,
or, uh, The Monophonics,
or, in this case, The Beatles.
Wow, this is the most
complicated joke
- I've ever heard.
- No...
Nice song, though.
- It's not a nice song.
- No, it is, mate.
Don't do yourself down
just 'cause you look like
a cartoon character.
It's-it's a very nice song.
It's not a very nice song,
Nick.
It's one of the greatest songs
ever written.
Well, it's not Coldplay.
It's not "Fix You."
It's not bloody "Fix You,"
Carol,
it's a great,
great work of art.
Wow, somebody suddenly got
very cocky.
That song was exquisite.
How come I've never
heard it before?
Okay, I don't know what
you guys are playing at,
but this is so weird,
a-and quite unfair,
in light of me
having lost two teeth,
looking like a sort of
reverse rabbit.
I-I'm on pretty heavy
medication.
Just let me out.
All right.
I thought you liked the medication.
Yeah, I do love the medication.
I really don't know
what you're cross about.

Oh, Christ.
No way. No way.

Mm.

Oh... you are having me on.

Okay.
No.

Elle!
Jack.
- What...?
- Do you genuinely not know who The Beatles are?
Genuinely.
Okay.
Then I'm in a really, really,
really complicated situation.
See you soon.
Nice pajamas.
Jack!
Christ. I don't even know
if I can remember the words
to the songs.
Okay. "Eleanor Rigby...
"Eleanor Rigby lives

No.
"Eleanor Rigby,

No, does... does she have...?
Does she have socks?

- The window, the window.
Um... Yes. Right.
Can you all just give me
just one second?
I want... If there's any more
factors of, um, 18,
I wanna hear 'em.
- Yes?

I think I may have got some,
like, new songs.

little story. Jack, you work
in the wholesale warehouse
in Lowestoft.
And we hear members of the
retail trade have been getting
a free CD along with
their jumbo boxes
- of Nescafé and washing powder.
- That's right.
But you're gonna sing us
a new song now.
So, here's Jack Malik,
the singing wholesaler,

No mention of, uh, jumbo-sized
Fairy liquid, but nice work.
You ever thought about doing
a wholesale-based song?
Not really, no.
You could call it, uh,
"In My Warehouse"
instead of "In My Life."
Now, time to find out
what's happening
in Kerry's Kitchen.
G'day, everyone.
It's Kerry here.
I could've written every song
of the Rolling Stones
or David Bowie.
I'll always just be Lowestoft's
warbling warehouseman.
Oh, no, don't.
- That's not true.
- So obviously is.
That song was really beautiful.
Who-who did you write it about?
Stop here. Stop the car.
- Elle.
- Hmm?
- These songs.
- Mm.
There's something about 'em
you should know.
Oh. Hi.
Hi... it's the
musician... Ed Sheeran.
- I beg your pardon.
- Ed Sheeran.
- I'm a musician.
- Yeah, no, seriously though, who is it?
This must be a bad line,
I'll-I'll call you back.
Who was it?
He said it was Ed Sheeran,
the musician.
That'll be Nick.
Mm.
Nick!
No, it's Ed Sheeran again.
Yeah, can I speak
to Carol, please?
There's no one
called Carol here.
Except there is.
She's always there.
Okay, mate, um,
I'll leave it there.
Amazing performance tonight
though, on TV.
That song, "In My Life,"
that was really beautiful.
What did he say?
He said he really enjoyed
"In My Life."
And what did Carol say?
- She wasn't there.
- She's always there.
I think it might've been
Ed Sheeran.
The musician?
Hi.
- Hello.
- I'm Ed.
- Um, is Jack here?
- Oh. Right.
I'll see if he's up.
Just wait there, love.
Jack!
- It's for you.
- Who is it?
His name's Ed.
He's got a nice, friendly face.
- Hi.
- Hi.
C... Uh, come in.
Your shirt's inside out.
Oh, Christ.
Uh, we should...
Ouch.
So, uh, look, I'm sorry
to barge in like this.
No, no, uh, major pop stars
are always dropping round,
you know?
Lady Gaga won't leave us alone.
You're funny.
Well, funny-looking, at least.
Yeah, so, anyway, I live, uh,
I live locally,
and I saw your song on TV.
And it was really good.
- Wow.
- So I googled you,
and I listened to your songs
on the warehouse website.
And they were even better.
Gosh, thanks.
All right, don't mind me.
So, I've had
the support act drop out
of the European leg
of the tour,
and I was wondering
if you'd consider it.
- Consider what?
- S... Yeah.
Being the opening act.
- For you, seriously?
- Nope.
Yeah, why not?
W-Wha... When would I start?
Tuesday.
Do you know
where the pickle is?
No.
- No.
- Tu... What, Tuesday?
- Not next July?
- No. Tuesday.
- Is your hearing all right?
- No.
No, my hearing is fine,
it's just, you keep saying
lots of really strange things.
But yes, yes, thank you, yes.
- Um, how long do you need?
- About 30 minutes. Maximum.
Any more than that, people
start getting a bit restless.
- You know, "Bring on the ginger geezer."
- Yeah.
Get in.
Night.
- Night.
- Night.
Night. Nice to meet you.
You look like Ed Sheeran,
you know.
I am Ed Sheeran.
Oh, right. Well done.
Light show?
- Preferably not, no.
- Well, that's good,
'cause I've only got the torch
on my phone, so...
Have you got any beer?
Uh, cider.
- Cider works.
- Okay.
I'll have a cider with the man
that wrote "Yesterday."
Yeah.
Mum, Dad,
who drunk all the cider?
- That is nuts!
- Yeah, as you said, it's nutty.
And he's absolutely covered
in tattoos.
Nice dressing gown, by the way.
No, it's not. No.
Don't. Don't start.
It looked so good online,
so I just ordered it,
and the most disgusting pink
thing in history turns up.
- So good.
- Meanwhile, you need a new roadie.
Tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You're not coming?
No, of course not.
I'm, you know, a schoolteacher.
I teach maths.
I can't suddenly manage
Ed Sheeran's support act.
Yeah, maybe you can, though.
Um... yeah.
Well, I certainly can't do it
this Tuesday.
'Cause we've got a parent-
teacher's evening at 6:45.
And, although I like you, I...
I don't like you enough to let
down the whole of year ten.
- Right. Okay.
- Sorry.
Lucy, Ellie's resigned
from her post.
Do you fancy being my roadie
in Moscow on Tuesday?
Sorry. Would love to,
but we've got rehearsals
for the school play.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
Let's think, plan C.
- Oh, no.
- What?
I've had an idea.
It's a very bad idea.

Okay, Moscow,
it was Jack Malik!
And now are you ready
for Ed Sheeran?!
On a three-hour plane journey,
without a guitar?
Yeah.
'Cause I thought
we were going to Russia,
so I should write a song
about Russia.
Yeah, that... I just,
I thought it was really cool
that you called it "USSR,"
you know?
It probably stopped
being called that
before you were born.
Yeah.
Amazing, man.
- Loved that USSR track.
- Thanks.
Right. I've got an idea.
Everyone, I think we can all
agree that we're impressed
with Jack's songwriting talent,
right?
- Whoo-hoo!
- - So, here's the plan.
I'm gonna go out that door,
Jack's gonna go out this door.
And whoever writes the
best song in ten minutes, wins.
What's the prize?
No prize.
Just being the best songwriter.
Jack "Back in the USSR" Malik,
are you in?
- Okay.
- Okay.
And it can't be anything
you've written before.
Like, nothing
in your bottom drawer.
Has to be new, tonight.
- Right.
- Cool.
- Fun.
- I still,
still think
there should be a prize, Ed.
I mean, with all his money,
he could afford a tenner.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here tonight
to witness an epic battle.
In the blue corner,
Sir Ed Sheeran!

Nope, no vote. No vote.
No. That was, uh,
an interesting moment.
I was always told that
there would be someone
who came along that was
a lot better than me,
and you are definitely
better than me, Jack.
Yeah, wow.
That was, uh,
one of the best songs
I've heard in my life.
I mean, these things
are complicated.
Yeah.
Obviously not complicated
for you, though, right?
I think I'm gonna go to bed.
Someone should probably shag
him while they have the chance.
- - Yeah.
- Pick me, Jack!
You're definitely Mozart, mate.
And I'm definitely Salieri.
Night, Jack.
Hi.
I'm Debra Hammer.
I'm Ed's manager.
We should talk.
Yeah. I... Well, I g... I mean,
- I've kind of got a manager back home.
- Oh?
No, but, but no,
but we should talk.
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.
That's great.
Uh... good.
Have a good night.
I'll see you in Los Angeles.
In Los Angeles?
Yeah, well, we, we need you
to come to L.A.
See, we pay and then you come
and you write songs
and then we release them,
and you make a ton of money.
And then we take most of it.
Okay.
I have a question.
Is this the best
that you can look?
We'll figure it out.
Gorgeous.
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie!
Oh, well, in my capacity as Jack's
former musical mentor,
stroke manager,
stroke roadie, stroke driver...
'Cause he can't even drive.
- Ooh!
- Loser! Loser!
I did try to teach you.
I did try to teach you.
- Honestly, no, you can have the job back.
- No, thanks.
Why would anyone ever leave Suffolk
before the day they die?
Right, but if you must go
to Los Angeles
- and hang out with perverts and drug addicts...
- I must.
...then we wish you
good luck and success.
Or, even better, failure
and a swift return.
Failure and a swift return!
Yay!
Will you miss me, Jack?
Course I'll miss you.
Hey.
Of course I'll miss you.
You're leaving, so...
I can ask you anything.
How did I get
in the wrong column?
How did I get in
the "friend, manager, roadie"
column, inst...
...instead of the
"And I Love Her" column?
What are you doing up there?
Come on. If you don't
come downstairs soon,
your mum will be too drunk
to make her speech.
- Jack!
- Coming, Ellie Wellie?
- Yeah.
- Come on down, my baby bunny, we miss you!
- Jack!
- Ellie! - Jack! -Jack!
Jackie, what are you
doing up there?
Oh, God.
Are those definitely columns?
Jack!
Well, a girl can certainly
tell the difference.
- Jack!
- It...
Actually, seriously,
it is getting a bit grim,
so you may wanna,
uh, uh, come down.
- Come on!
- We miss you!
Jack!
Wow, Ellie. That's...
- big news on a big night.
- Ellie!
Jack, get down here now, mate!
Jack!
Come on!

Welcome to
my little beach shack.
Thank you
for coming all this way.
Good to see you. Well...
- you're not very attractive.
- No.
- You're out of shape.
- Yes.
You're skinny,
yet, somehow, round.
Uh-huh.
You have been profoundly
unsuccessful for ten years.
- Yep.
- And until about a month ago,
we'd call you
a complete failure.
Well, that's not quite
how I'd put it, but...
- We would say that you were a complete failure.
- Yeah.
Sit, please.
But now, now...
you've hit an extraordinary
songwriting groove,
and you want to be the biggest
star in the world.
- Well, mmm...
- "Yes" is the answer to that question.
Well, yes, I guess.
Not, "Well, yes, I guess."
"Yes."
I guess.
Buddy, what I'm offering you,
is the great and glorious
poisoned chalice
of money and fame.
If you don't want to drink it,
which I would understand,
go back and have a warm beer
in little, bonny England.
If you do want to drink it,
I need to hear you say,
"Debra, I'm so thirsty.
Give me the goddamn chalice."
So, which is it?
I'll take the chalice.
Yeah.

Yeah.
What's a "cigarette"?
What?
Wow.
Uh... oh, yes, Jack,
this is Hilary.
She's gonna be working
with you on your image.
Do I have to have an image?
Well, if you don't
have an image,
- then the lack of image becomes an image.
- Right.
And the music sounds so joyful.
It'd be a shame to let it down
by you being so...
- off-putting.
- Mm-hmm.
I can see how you two
might be friends.
Yeah, yeah.
So, here...
Okay, here's the plan.
We're gonna take
the five best songs,
we'll put them online, right?
No visuals, just the music.
The enigma of Jack Malik.
And then,
we wait until we've...
fixed all of this,
and we release
an astonishing,
era-defining double album that
changes popular music forever.

So, salad instead of the fries.
I'll have the grilled salmon,

- Where are you?
- Right behind you.
Having a cheese
and tomato baguette
and a packet of crisps.
Jack, would it, would it be
annoying of me to point out
we should be
- heading for the airport?
- How long have we got?
Well, in real terms,
minus an hour.
Okay.
Rocky, this is completely not
a conversation you're part of.
- No, of course it's not.
- Yeah.
No, deeply private.
With your future happiness
at stake.
Right, did you two
sleep together last night?
- No.
- No. - What a waste.
Anyway, I'll keep an eye
on the clock.
You've got precisely
four minutes.
- So...
- So... -
Um...
it's about last night.
What about it?
Well, it was almost
quite a moment.
And I woke up, and I panicked.
And I wanted to talk.
Okay, then talk.
Right.
So, um...
N...
'cause we...
And how do you think
it's going so far?
It's not great, but...
No, no, let me try and help.
You've had 20 years
to make your move.
Well, I couldn't exactly make
my move when I was seven.
Then you've had ten years.
Right. Well, we've always been
like brother and sister.
It's very bad indeed for...
for brothers and sisters
to have sex.
- Except that we're not brother and sister.
- No, exactly.
- Right, but...
- No, so...
I've been waiting half my life
for you to wake up and love me.
Having loved you
for half a lifetime,
I realized when you left,
that I had made a bad choice
doing that.
And now, it's got
even trickier because...
if...
When you were playing in pubs,
we were the perfect match.
But now...
I-I...
I'm an actual schoolteacher
in actual Lowestoft,
and you're the world's greatest
singer-songwriter.
- No, I'm not.
- Except that you probably are.
Okay. Two minutes, ladies
and gentlemen, two minutes.
Also, um...
Debra's on my phone for you.
Apparently, she's having dinner
with the head of the label
and you're meant to be
FaceTiming in, so...
Just go away, Rocky.
Okay. One minute, 53.
In the end, to you,
I'll always, really, just be
Ellie with the frizzy hair.
And Ellie from
the "Fun chum" column.
Ellie, who, for reasons
no one understands,
drives you around in her car.
So, just go and please
just catch your plane.
We haven't finished
the conversation.
Well, um, we have.
We have.
Unless...
in Liverpool Lime Street at...
11:14 on a Friday...
unless you choose to stay.
Jack.
Jack. You have to
get on the plane.
- What are you still doing in Liverpool?
- I can't stay today.
I've gotta do
The Late Late Show tomorrow,
and I've gotta do the
Marketing Meeting of Meetings
- and, oh, it's ridiculous...
- And that was your chance.
Now, quick, go.
Please, leave.
- Sorry.
- Hey, do you mind if I nick a couple of crisps
- for the journey?
- Look, I want you to be happy and,
and to make marvelous music.
I always have.
- No, not all the crisps!
- Okay.
Just go, go, go, go, go.
Your, your future is
o-out the door and to the left.
A taxi rank.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so...
Okay. Welcome to the Major
Marketing Meeting of Meetings.
So amazing to have Jack himself
right here in the building.
Give it up for Jack, y'all.
Now, uh, Jack, I,
I do believe I speak for
everyone in attendance today
when I say...
- it is the climax of our careers...
- Yes!
...to be working on this
mind-bending album with you.
Give it up, y'all.
Yeah!
You, you don't have to clap
every time.
But thanks very much.
Mr. Modesty!
- Give it up for modesty!
- No, seriously, d...
That's what he does
right off the top.
Now, as you all know,
the songs we released online
have created
unprecedented excitement.
Yes.
- Yes.
- No.
So, now upon us falls
the mighty task of packaging
everything together
into one single,
irresistible album.
Now, Jack came up with some
title suggestions himself
and, uh,
we worked on some of those.
You know, I especially
got a kick out of
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Yeah, that's...
It's okay to laugh,
'cause it's funny.
It is. It's, uh,
a lot of words, Jack.
But ultimately, in the end,
we just felt it was, uh,
uh, too confusing, right?
Too confusing. And, uh,
The White Album
has some diversity issues.
How?
That's a lot of white, Jack.
And I know you were
pretty enthusiastic
about Abbey Road.
I gotta say,
it didn't have a lot
going for it...
if I can put it to you
like that.
Uh, it's just a road,
with a bunch of people
driving down the wrong side
of the street.
That's not exactly
what I meant, but...
But we've been developing
some ideas of our own, now.
You know, we weren't just
sitting around.
We focused on the one thing
that makes this man here
unlike anyone else in the
entire world of music today.
No collaborators, no cowriters,
no samples, no steals, hmm?
No "featuring Cardi B,"
no "featuring Bieber."
Just the simple, pure genius...
of One Man Only.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
And, as a second wave,
because of the miracle
that is One Man Only,
it's just this.
Just this.
Mmm, mmm. I know.
I know.
So, let Operation Jack begin!
Each week, a new song online.
Each week, a new TV show.
We start with Corden,
then we move to Kimmel,
then Fallon, then Colbert
and then Thursday Night Live!
Whoo!
Song, song, song.
Show, show, show.
Boom, bang, bazillions.
Now, let's go make
so much money that,
by this time next Christmas,
we are wiping our asses
with solid-gold toilet paper.
Ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome,
the one, the only, Mr. Jack Malik!
Jack, I'm such a fan.
It's great to meet you.
Thank you for being here.
The songs of yours
that I've heard, they are,
they're amazing.
What's life like for you
at the moment right now?
I mean, the expectation
for the album
is just rising
to insane levels, isn't it?
Yeah, well, they're...
they're insane to me.
I mean, who here's excited
about this album?
Listen to that.
In this age of,
sometimes, 16 people
writing on one song,
suddenly, here's a guy,
him and a guitar, and he writes
everything himself, on his own.
Yeah. I mean... Well, you know,
that's how it always
used to be, though, with,
uh, with, like, James Taylor
or Stevie Wonder,
Bruce Springsteen.
So I don't think
it's that exceptional.
But is it just you?
Well, yes.
But is it?
Well, y-yes.
- Yes, it is.
- Excellent.
Because as chance would
have it, a-and do forgive me,
because we-we love a surprise
on this show.
As chance would
darn well have it,
I've got two men backstage
who claim that the songs
are theirs.
In fact, they say that all
of your tunes
are the work of their band,
The Beatles.
I d... I don't know...
I don't...
Well, let's see how this
plays out, shall we?
Ladies and gentlemen,
all the way
from Liverpool, England,
please welcome,
Mr. Paul McCartney
and Mr. Ringo Starr!
♪ Na, na-na, na-na-na-na ♪
♪ Na-na-na-na ♪
♪ Hey, Jude. ♪
Hey.
Bang me backwards over a Buick.
It's gonna be the greatest
album of all time.
It's really incredible, man.
- Hey, Ed.
- How you doing? Um, I'm just in town for a couple
of days. I thought I'd come
and see the genius at work.
I'm just trying to
work out your process.
Is it music first
or lyrics first?
Um, it varies.
But, like, with this song,
for instance, the, um,
the-the "Hey Jude" one
must have some story behind it.
Well, yeah.
No, it do... it does.
So, it was the son
of a friend of mine
who was having a hard time.
Um, it, it, it just,
it came to me as a s...
as a song of comfort.
I don't believe you.
What?
I mean, I just...
I don't believe you.
- It's one genius idea after the other, you know?
- Oh, right.
I do have a suggestion, though.
Um, about the song.
The-the title, "Hey Jude."
Jude is just,
it's a bit old-fashioned.
- That was the kid's name, right?
- What kid?
- That the song's about.
- Oh, the kid, the kid, the kid.
Yes, the-the... the sad kid.
Now, l-let me just
give you this advice, right?
Song title...
I won't charge you a penny
for it as well...
"Hey Dude."
Um...
♪ Hey, du... ♪
"Hey Dude," are you sure?
He's right. That's...
that's so much better.
Is he?
- Is it?
- Yeah, yeah.
- ♪ Hey, dude, don't make it bad ♪
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. - This isn't real.
- Definitely gonna be
one of the best songs
of the generation.

- Jack, Ellie.
Oh, sorry, guys.
I gotta take this.
Just give me a minute, Ed.
Sorry.
- Elle.
- Jack.
I'm so glad you called.
I'm not enjoying myself here
at all.
Oh, right. Well, um...
I've got two bits of news.
I'm riveted.
All right.
Well, the first one...
- big one.
- Yeah?
The Pier Hotel.
What? In Gorleston?
The place that
closed down rather than
have me play?
Yes. It's reopening.
You're bloody kidding.
I am bloody not.
It's re-bloody opening.
That's amazing!
That's huge news!
That's-that's-that's
ma-bloody-ssive!
All right, what's the second?
I mean, it can't be as big.
But tell me anyway.
Um...
n-number two is...
I've been seeing someone.
Right.
Do I know him?
Yeah. It's Gavin.
I-I didn't want you to find out
from someone else.
Every day,
he puts me in the right column.
Of course.
The "true love" one.
Of course.
I've gotta go.
Ah, God.
Yeah, course you do.
Um, okay. Bye. Bye.
What? What could possibly
be so urgent
that I can't make
a single phone call?!
How the hell am I supposed to
get any of the songs right
if you're just
all clustering me
and stopping me
from being creative?
How can I ever be creative
if I'm never ever left alone?!
Okay.
We'll leave you alone then,
genius.
No, I'm not... I'm sorry.
No, it's g... It's, uh,
it's superstar rights.
Treat the people that you work
with like shit on your shoes.
Hmm.
Ellie told you the news, then?
- Yeah.
- You know, I never, never understood
what you didn't see in her.
I mean, I-if I'd been you,
twice a day I would have loved
her up like a lusty lion.
Rocky, if I ask you
to just shut up,
really, really, really shut up,
would that be okay?
Right.
Can I just start again and say,
"Isn't it wonderful news?
"And I hope they'll be
very happy together
and have gorgeous kids."
Is that better?
No. It's worse.
I have got a third option.
But...
I'm sorry.
Um, I'm really sorry, everyone.
I'm just...
I'm really stressed.
What was so urgent?
Oh, um, no, nothing.
It's just we have to
decide today where and when
we're going to
launch the album.
So, nothing big, apart from
probably the biggest decision
of your stupid life.
- What?
- You ass.
I do have one thought.
And the little town
of Gorleston has never seen
anything like this before.
At 3:00 p.m. today, on the
rooftop of the Pier Hotel,
Jack Malik, local boy
turned pop phenomenon,
will premiere his highly
anticipated first album.
And word seems to have got out.
Can we, uh...?
Wow. Look at this.
Look at you.
Didn't want to disturb.
Just wanted to, you know...
Well, it's...
Who'd have thought?
While we were downstairs
drinking cider
and eating jelly,
you were up in your room
writing "She Loves You."
Well...
Are you, uh,
you playing our song?
- Your song?
- "Let It Be."
Oh, well, we've never forgotten
we were the first people
to hear it.
Well, the start of it,
at least.
Three times.
So proud.
Our beautiful, blazing boy.
- Aw. Oh.
- Aw. Still, don't wanna...
- Mind your suit, love. It's... blue.
- Yeah.
- We'll leave you to it.
- Okay.
One last thing, son.
Yeah, Dad?
The sandwiches.
I see there's tuna.
Are y-you gonna finish
them all?
- No, please take them all.
- Or if you don't...?
Oh, what a day.
What an amazing day.
Sorry.
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack!
Well, you look good.
That's a tight pant.
Mmm.
Okay.
We've got a jaw and a chin.
Ooh!
That's not bad.
That's... This'll work.
This'll work. Mmm.
Don't...
What? - Nothing.
Yeah?
- Oh. Hi, Ellie. Come in.
- Hi.
- And who have we here?
- Um, Debra, this is Ellie.
Ellie, this is Debra, my agent.
No!
The Ellie?
Oh! He's mentioned me?
No, no. I'm kidding.
I know nothing
about his life because
he's a product to me.
Unless you're the one
that was his manager.
In which case, wow.
Huge mistake giving that up.
Oh, it's surreal, isn't it?
Being back at the Pier Hotel.
- Yeah, indeed.
- Oh.
- I'm gonna go look at the stage, yeah?
- Mm.
- Yeah.
- It's this way.
Press conference in ten.
Goodbye, lovebirds.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
left Lime Street, okay?
- It was a terrible mistake.
- Oh, no.
- Don't say that, please.
- Can we...?
- Don't say that.
- Elle...
I-I've heard your new songs.
- They're incredible.
- O-Okay. No, they aren't.
I don't even know
who you are anymore.
Everything changed
after the accident.
- Wha-What happened?
- Jack.
- And here's Gavin.
- Jack, Jack.
Jack!
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.
- Oh, hey, mate.
- Jack.
- How you doing, man?
Jack. Jack.
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, really?
It sounds like you do
and it's, "Jack."
Jack!
- Oh...
- We were just coming to say good luck and, um,
- break a leg.
- Yeah. Well,
if I fall off the roof,
then a broken leg
will be a good result.
All right, then. Let's go.
Come on.
Ka-ching!
Ellie.
- Ooh.
- Wow.
Looks pretty quiet.
Well, maybe we should do
a slightly shorter set?
I mean really quiet.
What do you want?
Uh, we're here for the gig.
I'm the musician.
Well, that's pretty tricky.
'Cause we closed
three weeks ago.
I'd take it as a hint, I would.
I'm gonna have to give up
the part-time jobs,
go back to teaching.
What?
No. Don't go back to teaching.
I've got no choice.
Jack, if you go back
to teaching,
that is when you've got
no choice.
Yeah, because you'll end up
putting all your genius
into all those kids
and then you won't have any
i-imagination or energy left
to put into your music,
which really matters.
Please...
Okay, okay.
Crazy, slightly mad woman.
No one has ever written
this many great songs
in this short a time.
- How do you do it?
- Honestly, I don't know.
Sometimes it feels like someone else
has written all the songs.
Any idea who?
What's the inspiration behind
"Strawberry Fields Forever"?
- Well...
- Who was your favorite,
John, Paul, George or Ringo?
- Sorry?
- Who's your greatest influence?
Jack, is it true that you wrote
"Long and Winding Road" in...
W-Why don't you record in
Abbey Road like they did?
When can we see
another album, Jack?
Jack, what's the story
behind "Let it Be"?
How'd you come up
with "Yesterday"?
Thank you so much.
We have to go to the roof now.
We'll see you later.
Jack, what was the first song
you ever wrote?
Jack, what are you gonna
play for us today?
It's a nice bar they've got
down there, actually.
You haven't been drinking,
have you?
No, I have not.
Well, y-yeah, I have.
But I find a couple of pints
midday sharpens my senses.
- Oh!
- I'm not sure it does, mate.
Right, here goes.
Actually, before I open
this door, can I just say,
for a long time I didn't really
know why I'd been born.
Felt a bit pointless.
But now I do know.
I was born to serve the
greatest musician of all time.
It is my honor now
to open this door
for the moment the entire world
has been waiting for.
Thanks, Rock.
Oh, it's certainly been one
hell of a journey, hasn't it?
So it has. So it has.
Right.
Here goes.
No, that's not...
Uh, wrong door.
Um, let us, let us continue
our journey together.
Right.
Here it does go.
Jack!
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Thank you, Gorleston!
Jack! Jack! Jack!

Yeah.
'Cause I saw you went to Penny
Lane and Strawberry Fields.
Yeah.
Eleanor Rigby's grave.
I know.
'Cause you can't sing songs

- No.
- No.
I thought as much.
Well, we just wanted to say
thank you, that's all.
Thank me?
We three seem to be
the only ones who remember.
And we can't sing.
So, we just wanted to say...
thanks very much.
Myself also.
From bottom of heart.
Oh, my God!
I thought you were gonna
arrest me, or...
- No. It's just lovely to hear the songs.
- Yeah.
I have missed them so.
Can't remember
any of the lyrics.
- No. I'm struggling there as well.
- I know.
"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite's"
in completely the wrong order.
- Very big mess, indeed.
- Oh, yeah.
And "Hey Dude"? Really?
I can't apologize.
It was bloody Ed Sheeran.
But this is amazing!

A world without The Beatles,

If we could just switch on

- Oh!
- Oh! It's Ellie!
This is Ellie.
Hi, Ellie!
And when I had no fans,
Ellie was my only fan.
The only person in the world
who believed in me.
And that's why, tonight,
I asked Ed
if I could come on and play,
'cause I want to tell her...
and you,
- what I've done.
- What are you saying?
Darn it, Ellie,
I've been untrue.
All the songs I've sung tonight
were really written
and performed by four men
called John Lennon,
Paul McCartney, George Harrison
and Ringo Starr.
The Beatles.
They were the real geniuses.
Me, I'm just a, sort of,
go-between to, well,
get their astonishing stuff
into the world.
- Beatles?
- And, uh, I-I-I passed their amazing work off
as my own so I could look like
I was amazing, too.
I want you all to know that
I'm not gonna take any money
for this work that isn't mine.
So, you can have
all the songs for free.
Rocky, do it.
Right. Here goes.
They're being released,
for free, online now.
And I'd love to not
take any more praise for it.
So, um...
I'm so sorry.
And while I'm at it, there's
one other thing to say as well,
because... I've been a fool
twice over.
And I want to thank Ellie...
- for her love.
- Aw!
And, Ellie...
Elle...
- I love you.
- Aw!
- Aw.
- Oh.
I always have.
Always.
That's definitely enough
talking for one night.
But it's been a blast.
We love you, Jack!
We still love you!
Where's the stage?
What floor is this?
Where is the goddamn stage?!
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
That's a lot of information to take in.
I know.
Well, if you'd told me I was
gonna be on the big screen,
I'd have got my hair done.
I'm sorry.
You didn't write
any of the songs?
No.
That is very bad behavior.
- On a global scale.
- Yeah.
It's very bad.
Well, this is a strange one.
Of course I've always known
I was number two.
But that's not
a bad place to be.
Some of the best songs
never made it to number one.
"Common People" by Pulp,
for a start.
It's a total classic.
And obviously all I want
is for Ellie to be happy.
Gavin.
Best man I ever met.
- Thank you, Gavin.
- He's here.
- He's here! - Go on.
- What is that?
- Oh, God. - GAVIN: Go!
- Jack! - Jack!
- Oh, my... We should definitely go!
- Yeah, yeah.
Shit!
Where's that lying
son of a bitch?
Move, idiots!
Look, he's here!
Jack!
Jack, please take me with you.
No one else will employ me.
I-I'm rubbish at my job.
Just hold them off, Rocky.
In the name of money, stop!
Get back here, you stupid,
English mother...
- Uh, ooh. Sorry, Debra.
- Jack!
Debra, stop this.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
