You know, Al, I'm not gonna play safe

Right to the edge, and do pirouettes.
Pirouettes?

the dog story is the bestjoke

But if... Oh, but you won't.
But if, and I mean only if...
it... Jesus, Tommy,
you're makin' me doubt things.
If it doesn't work, use the saver.

That room is filled with people.
Friends, old friends of the family.
The whole of show business is there,

I just wanted you to know...
how proud I am of you.

If this audience doesn't laugh,
then... I don't know what.
I just think all those years

and learning the business
the way I had to...
is about to pay off for you.
And I hope so, Tommy,
because I know
you haven't always found life easy, son.

- I want to thank Hal for
that marvelous introduction.
- [Knock At Door] Mr. Fawkes?
- He did it. He did it.
Mr. Fawkes?

Hal is the oldest performer

My wonderful parents,

Actually, they hated me as a kid.
I remember once...
they took me to an orphanage
and told me to mingle.

You ever feel like killing yourself?
You?
Ever feel like no matter what you do,
no matter how hard you try,
people will always see you
as one thing?
It's all you can be, just one thing?
It's like a lifetime of bad luck.
[Uncertain Chuckles]
Came home to my apartment last week,
found my dog looking sheepish.
[Shouts Angrily]
Dogs can look sheepish!
I feed him. He won't eat.
Starts wailin' real loud.
R-r-r-r-r!
I don't know what to do!
I go into the back room,
see he's broken a very large mirror.
I say, "Did you do this?"
He says, "Yeah." He did.
He did! He said, "Yeah."
I said, "Well, that's okay.
Why are you so upset?"
- He said, "Forty-nine years bad luck."
- [Scattered Laughter]
[Al Laughing Loudly]

Oh, well, I guess a joke is like a lady
getting out of a car:
Sometimes you see it;
sometimes you don't.
[Scattered Laughter]
Huh. Did I say something funny?
[Man Laughs]
I was playing Carthage, Tennessee.
You ever play Carthage, Tennessee?
You know, where they brought back
the death penalty for comedians only?
Huh? Guy in a bar says to me,
"I used to own this place.
"Built it up from nothing to be
the brightest spot in carthage.
Do they call meJohn the bar owner?
No, sir."
Guy says to me, "I used to own
the biggest farm in the county.
"Farmed it man and boy for 30 years.
I looked after animals.
"I looked after crops.
I employed a dozen men.
"They call meJohn the farmer?
No, sir.
"I ran for congress.
I ran for public office.
"For ten years I sat in Washington and

bona fide maniac.
Hiya, Dad.
Hi, Uncle Thomas.
Are you all right?
I'm gonna die!
Gentlemen.
What I need to know now is...
how far does this man go

Mr. Parker.
Your brother Thomas doesn't seem
to speak at all, is that right?
- He's depressed.
- How long has he...
How long has he been that depressed?
When did he last speak?
Twelve years ago.
I gather you're in the business
yourself, Mr. Tarascas.
- A comedian?
- Mmm. Sort of.
And you're prepared to pay money...
to see comedy material
here in Blackpool?
- You bet.
- What? Actual cash?
Bingo.
I'm serious, Larry.
Everything I see, I'll pay to see.
Fifty pounds for a look.
And if I buy,
that's where you step in.
I never thought of it as such
a competitive business, I must say.
Well, it is.
What sort of thing do you want to see?
Whatever is funny in Blackpool.
Old routines. Funny routines!
- Funny people.
- Jokes?
No! No jokes.
I'm looking for another way.
Jokes, I've paid for.
I've paid the best writers in the states
for jokes. Trust me, it doesn't work.
Nojokes, okay?
Funny people. Physical comedy.
Original. Original ideas.
Visual? Slapstick?
- But it may not be scripted.
- Doesn't mean I can't buy it.
Look, Lawrence.
I'm gonna be Frank.
I don't have long to live.
I'm lookin' for something,
and I don't know what it is.
I'm an educated man.
I like to analyze.
I'm a reasonably wealthy man.
It's something special
I'm sure I'm gonna find here.
Whoever brings it to me
might not even know its worth.
Whatever it is,
it will be something I don't have.
Another way of looking at life.
I spent the first six years
of my life here.
There should be no reason
why the sun can't shine again.
I mean, why do all
the best things in life...
belong to the past?
I don't know.
But it's true.
You're right.
So, no jokes. Okay?
Jokes I'm gonna leave to George Fawkes.
George Fawkes.
Now, he was funny.
Still is!
Surely not.
I thought he, uh, died in Las Vegas.
No.
I died in Las Vegas.
[No Audio]
[Gulls Crying]
Now, Jack,
I'm here to help you.
I'm going to ask you a few questions.
Unrelated.
All right?
Where were you born?
- Blackpool.
- Why Blackpool?
'Cause I wanted to be near me mother.
Have you lived here all your life?
Not yet.
They tell me you had no real education.
Is that right?
Now. Tell me.
Of this list,
which do you think
is the odd one out?
House.
School. Dog.
Cinema. Church.
- Dog. [Laughs]
- Good.
'Cause a dog wouldn't go

Which of these is the odd one out?
Malice. Jealousy.
Greed.

And that is not new talent.

- [Bell Rings]
- [Sportscaster's Voice]
The fight is on.
Dancin'Joe sayin', "Come on, come on!"
- [High-Pitched Voice] Why, you!
- [Bullet Ricochets]
The Buffalo's fierce, the Buffalo's
focused and definitely attempts...
to psych outJoe.
- * I put a spell on you *
- [Audience Laughing]
- * 'Cause you're mine **
- [Radio Tuning]
[Woman's Voice]
Feel your eyelids becoming very heavy.
[Doors Shutting]
[Man] One day I woke up
and I said, "I don't want to
look like this, feel like this.
This is not the way
I'm gonna live my life."
- [Sportscaster] The Dancer
explodes out of the corner.
- Look at that!
Real strong vibration.
**[Drum Solo]
- **[Finale]
- [Audience Applauding]
[Woman]
Anybody in this room who can't do that?
[Announcer]
The Buffalo lands a hook.
A right. An upper cut.
Exploding into Dancer!
[Young Man]
You see, having a great smile
really can change your life.
[Sportscaster]
A left. A left again. Joe is stumbling!
* It must be jelly
'cause jam don't shake like that *
[Woman]
Let your hands drop by your sides.
- [Sportscaster] He's unguarded
and the Buffalo sees a chance.
- [Thwack]
[Boy]
What? Where? When? How? Who? Who?
[Sportscaster]
He goes down three times!
[Woman]
Expel every drop of air from your body.
[Exhaling Sharply]
[Sportscaster] Chippy Cortez
is holding the Buffalo back
whileJoe's on the floor!
- [Man] I'm not a beast! [Laughing]
- [Audience Laughing]
[Sportscaster]
He's givin' the count!
[Auctioneer]
Out at 90, who'll go to 94?
94, four and a half...
[Woman]
And fill your body...
[Inhaling Deeply]
- [Sportscaster] He's up...
- [Woman] And let it out.
- [Buzzing Sound]
- [Sportscaster] He's down
again and Chip is counting!
[Young Man]
And it's been specially requested
that I do this next number for you.
- [Woman] In... out...
- [Inhaling, Buzzing]
- [Woman] In... out...
- [Inhaling, Buzzing]
- [Woman] In... out...
- [Inhaling, Buzzing]
[Sportscaster]
That's it! The Dancer's in trouble!
[Man]
It's the man in the moon!
[Sportscaster]
He's gonna go! Joe leaning...
Leaning desperately against the ropes!
Hardly knows where he is!
[Eartha Kitt's Voice]
Uska Dara's a little town in Turkey...
and in the old days
many women had male secretaries.
Oh, well. That's Turkey.
[Sportscaster]
He's confused!
I can see his wife Laura
up there in the ring with him.
He doesn't even know his own wife!
- [Man] It's the man in the moon!
- [Gunshot]
[Sportscaster]
Joe's on the deck!
[Woman]
Feel your breath go out, and pause.
[Applause Continues]
Bring him back!
He's brilliant!
[Club Owner]
I would never have let him
if I'd known who he was.
I have to say, I wasn't that surprised
when the detective here told me.
I mean, to be that good,
he had to be somebody.
I mean, he is good.
Jack.
Out of trouble
means out of sight.
All right?
Vanish...
or we'll make you vanish.
**[Piano]
[Audience Applauding]
This is your lucky day.
**[Piano Continues]
* I suppose it's just a sentimental *
* Continental point of view *
* But when out with English gentlemen *
* What mental torment I go through *
*Exercising fascinations *
* 'Til at last I lose my patience *
* For it's hard to understand *
* That in your peculiar land *
* Englishmen never make love by day *
- [Audience Laughing]
- *It can't be helped *
*It's just their way *
*It isn't good form to be warm *
*In the heat of the sun *
* You mustn't nestle or gaze
too much *
* You mustn't whisper *
* Or even touch *
* You mustn't reveal *
* What you feel *
* While you're missing the fun *
* You mustn't say darling *
* You mustn't hold hands *
* Or give him a hint he might *
* You mustjust sit and talk about *
- * Cricket and glands *
- [Audience Laughing]
* With no one at all in sight *
*But never despair as you waste away *
*For in spite of your plight
and your deep dismay *
* Though Englishmen
never make love by day *
*At night... *
[Chuckles]
- * They're quite all right *
- [Audience Laughing, Applauding]
* Englishmen wait
for the clock to chime *
