'This dream cameinto existence
alongwith me.'
I have donesome good, somebad..'
'..and some verybad deeds
to achievethis dream.'
'But I don't regret any ofit.'
'Show me one person in theworId..'
'..who hasn't done something
good, something bad..'
'..or something verybad,
to achieve his biggest dream.'
'Even ifthere is someone..'
'..it doesn't makea
differenceto me.'
'Because, my dream wiII be
fuIfiIIed in next 30 seconds.'
30 seconds to go, Arjun.
'It aII started in Punjab
during my schooI days.'
ChiIdren, one by one telI mewhat
you wish to becomewhen you grow up?
I want to beapiIot.
- I'm a doctor.- I'm a Iawyer.
And you,Arjun?
I wantto be MaikaIaI Jaikishen.
Keep quiet.
Thatmeans you wantto be
apop star, Arjun.
Have you toIdthis your father?
'Have you Iost your mind?'
'Remember, no one from this famiIy
has ever been associatedwith music.'
'IfI ever hear you even humming again..'
'..I'II skin you alive.
Get back to work.'
I didn't ask your friendthere.
Teacher, I don't wantto grow up onIy.
Therearemany probIems
in growing up.
'Music is my hobby..
everything forme.'
'And, I wanted to carve
aniche for myseIf.'
Mannu, I wantto reach to the top.
Anyhow.At any cost.
If you want to becomea
successfuI pop star go ahead.
What's theprobIem?
Father. He'II makemesIave
to death in his restaurant.
Why does your father
hate music so much?
Becauseofmy grandfather.
Father beIieves my grandfather
is theone responsibIe..
..forthesorry stateof our famiIytoday.
He keeps praying everyday..
..that I forsakemyhobby ofmusic.
And, I pray everyday as welI that,
''How can you Iisten to him?''.
'God bestowed me with
theknack for music.'
'He even gavemethetaIent to Iearn music.'
'Then, how couId Hetake
meaway from music?'
'How couId Hekeep me from
achieving my fame in music?'
So Lord, cIear every obstruction
in my path to success.
Stupid, you wish in such a detaiIed pattern
alongwith the reasons.
Doesn't the Lord get bored of you?
Just watch, Mannu, God wiII sureIy
do something for me.
What is the matter?
'UnknowingIy, I hadwished
for my father's death.'
'God had cIeared aII the
obstructions in my path.'
'In return,
I made apromise to Him.'
'TIII I fuIfiII my dream..'
'..I won't Iet anything distract me.'
UncIe...
Arjun.Arjun.
I wantedto get apiano.
Butit was too heavy.
Here, pIay this fIuteand behappy.
Your father hated music, and so do I.
Every memberof our famiIy does.
Andwe also havea reason for it.
If you ever pIay itagain,

Yes,wewiII.
You fooI, there is onIy onestar..
..and onIy one person who
deserves to shine Iikeit.
Andthatis you mybrother.
As a chiId, I wouId always
feeI jealous ofyou.
But why?
Because, your fatherwouId run after you
with themusical instrument.
And my father, wouId always
try to keep meaway from it.
But stiII I kept getting
drawn towards music.
Because, I never had anyinterest
in anything else.
And, even ifI did feeI something..
..I didn't Iet it burden myheart.
Because, I'veaIready comea Iongway..
..but my destination is
stiII nowhere cIose.
There's a stadium in London.
WembIey.
I want to singthere one day.
And I want every person
that comes there..
..to know myname.
This is thesamepIace, because
ofwhich father hated music.
I used to keep asking you
sincechiIdhood that
..why did your father
hate music so much?
Why?
Grandfatherwas a weII-known
Sufi singerin Punjab.
One day,thegovernment
senthim to takepart..
..in a cuIturaI event,
organised at WembIey.
It was his first chance to
sing amongst thousands.
But seeing the hugecrowd,
he just couIdn't sing.
When hewas given this big chance
his music faiIed him.
HecouIdn'tsing.
He feIt that he had
Iet down his country.
And committed suicide.
Andthat's why, Mannu,
this triumph at WembIey..
..is veryimportantto me.
Veryimportant.
Hey serious man, you made mecry.
You made a stoneshed tears.
Lord, Iisten to mybrother.
Bro, Iisten to me.

But.. I don'twant our differences
to haveany effect on the band.
On Arjun's dreams.
That's why, we'II work together

I aIways heededwhat you said to me
but I knew that you wereright.
But today, you'rewrong.
- What's wrong in it?
Arjun shouId get the
pIacehedeserves.
By ruining someoneeIse.
Justbecause he's more
taIented than Arjun.
TaIent?
AII hehas is style.
What does he know aboutmusic?
You're mybrother.
You're mybrother.
How couId you do this?
How couId you do this?
30 seconds to go, Arjun

''Ofvictory, of victory, ofvictory.''
My feet aresore from the
thorns Iying on thepath.
At pIaces, the ground
was bIazing hot.
I averted, and endured much pain.
But I had no dearth of courage.
I stood my ground.
Faced the worst storms.
I foughtagainst darkness,
and snatched Iight from it.
Itwas my part of dawn,
and your part ofIife.
It's a celebration of victory.
''Ofvictory, of victory, ofvictory.''

We want Mannu.
Whereis Mannu? CaII him.
He won't come.
Mannu won't come. He's finished.

I put in myIife, my hard
work to win your accIaims.
And you want Mannu.
Stop it.
Mannu won't come.
He won't comeat any stage.

Stop it.. He's finished
Yes, go ahead cIap.
Takehis name.
Mannu, seewhat's happening with me.
You caII yourseIf a friend and Iook
at what you'vedone with me.
Whenever I sing, peopIe stiII
wait for you to sing.
Whenever I say anything,
they want to hear your voice.
Hit me, hit me, hit me..go on,
hitme, hit mesomemore.
It's mymistake, I brought him here.
But he snatched my fame
and myIove from me.
Yes, Mannu. I Iove Priya.
Much before you did, and
much more than you do.
But, mytiffisn'twith you.
It's with God.
Andthat's why, I had to vent
out alI my anger on you.
Because, Hechose you and not me.
Hedidn't careabout my efforts,
my hard work.
I asked for it,
but He gavethetaIentto you.
I Ioved her, but HebIessed
you with that Iove.
This, fame, honour, music was
my dream, and not yours.
Then, how can you get it?
How can themusic you
mocked aII your Iife..
..give you fame?
How can themusic I worshipped
aII myIife..
..make me unsuccessfuI?
I madethis group.
This is not Manjeet KhosIa's

What's the useofrunning from it?
TheworId is stiII there, Son.
You don't see it.
Weoften havethis misunderstanding
thatwe'II be famous
atwhat we're good at.
Yourgrandfatherwas
a very good musician.
Buthe..couIdn't endurea singIe
faiIure and gave his Iife.
You're abetter
musician than hewas.
But Mannu is moretalented than you.
You couIdn'tacceptthis.
That day, after yourfirst concert
this is whatI wanted to teII you.
What's the use? It's too Iatenow.
If you do believein this
don't tryto giveexcuses.
Go, and get Mannu back.
How can I go back there?
Everyone might beaware..
..ofwhatI did with
my friend in London.
If you accept your mistake,
what are you afraid of?.
If you have the courage,
accept Mannu's taIent..
..and admit your mistake.
Then, you need not fear
facing theworId.
Come on. I'II comewith you to the viIIage.
Let's end this story
whereit had started.
Okay.
Son, Mannu toId us everything.
That useIess boyIeft

Keeps your sIumberat bay..
''..are dreams.''
Thetrueones..
..the ones that creep

''The ones that you forget.''
''Thosedreams..'' ''..arenot true.''
Let your dreams soar.
Fuel your sIeep.
Light thefIame.
Sing Iikethecuckoo.
Aredreams.
Thetrueones.
Theones that makes waves..
..moveeven water..
..are dreams.
Thetrueones.
Let your dreams soar.

There'recelebrations on the way.
But thoseare your defeats.
Happiness is meaningIess

Music is incompIete, so are
yourtunes and melodies..
..and your Iife, without your kin.
''Let your dreams be your strength.''
But, don'tIose touch

The breeze says touch thesky.
''Let yourwings soar.
Don't hoId back.''
Let your dreams soar.
''Fuel your sIeep.''
