Clara, look. Isn't it extraordinary?
- What is it?
- Can't you read?
Wait till you hear
about our new teacher.
- I think it's romantic.
- Oh, you do?
Well, I don't. And neither will my mother
when she comes back.
- She's Mademoiselle D.
- Well, who's Mademoiselle D?
Hurry up. Miss Haines is in.
- Our teacher's name is Mademoiselle D?
- No. Her name is Desportes.
But she was known as Mademoiselle D.
Don't you understand?
Shh. Girls, be quiet.
"Jane Van Buren.
Margaret Van Rensula."
Did you hear what Emily found out
about our new teacher?
Everybody's in, Miss Haines.
Thank you, Rebecca.
This is Rebecca Jay.
"Agnes Brevoort.
Mary Simpson.
Marianna Van Horn.
Rose Stanton.
Clara Parker and Elizabeth ward.
Dor..."
Young ladies, you may go to your seats.
"Dora Vanderbilt.
Emily Schuyler.
Louise DeRham, Helen Lexington.
Faith DeLancy..."
- Give me the paper.
- Here. Be careful.
"Virginia Knowles."
- See the look I gave her?
I don't think she'll like it here.
You may sit down, young ladies.
And now I want to say
that it gives me great pleasure...
...to introduce you
to your new instructress in French...
...Mademoiselle Henriette Desportes.
I'm glad to welcome her to our school.
And I trust you'll have the good sense
to profit by her teaching.
- You may take over.
- Thank you.
- Good morning, young ladies.
Good morning, Miss Haines.
Imagine, Emily...
...being involved in such a scandal
and teaching in our very class.
It's about time...
...we had some excitement in this school.
- And in your language:
Good morning, young ladies.
I've been appointed your teacher.
I hope before the end of the year I should
have deserved to become your friend.
Well, so much for that.
Will you turn in your literature books
to page one?
I will select at random from the roll.
Agnes Brevoort.
- Yes, mademoiselle?
- Will you start reading, please?
Dora. Give it to Emily.
Yes.
Emily.
Please, send me the paper.
Now Marianna Van Horn will translate.
Mademoiselle Van Horn,
you will translate, please.
I don't know the place.
The top of page one.
Perhaps Helen Lexington
has been paying more attention.
I, mademoiselle?
- Yes...
She'd better never jump on me
before the whole class...
...or I'll show her.
- Shh!
"What would you like to play?
George: No. Let us go to the woods...
...to hunt for fraise... "
You call them strawberries.
They are the strawberries
that grow in the woods.
How did you find out?
Mother's maid kept
all the Paris papers and I read them.
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure?
She's the same person
and I think it's wicked.
Mademoiselle Schuyler.
I believe that is your name,
Emily Schuyler?
Yes, mademoiselle.
You have been doing
a good deal of talking.
- Would you like to ask a question?
- Yes, mademoiselle.
But I'm not sure
you will like to answer it.
- Well, come here, will you?
Emily.
Was there something
you would like to know?
Could you tell me how
to spell "Conciergerie"?
I beg your pardon?
I'm asking you how to spell "Conciergerie."
I think it's the name of a French prison.
Why do you want to know?
I mean, that particular word?
Well, you said yourself
we were here to learn.
Yes.
Of course.
C...
...O...
...N...
...C...
...I...
...E- R...
And then you might show us
how you spell the name Praslin.
Emily.
Emily, be quiet.
And now if you will
all excuse me, please.
Come in, please.
Miss Haines, l...
- You?
- Yes, it's I.
I came to welcome you
to your new home.
Oh. Then I'm afraid you've come
for nothing, Henry.
I must leave at once.
You must accept my resignation.
- What?
- They have found out.
- I was a fool to think they wouldn't.
- What have they found out?
I should have told you before
I accepted this post dishonorably.
I let you take me in
as Henriette Desportes...
when you're also Henriette Deluzy,
the notorious Mademoiselle D.
Is that it, my dear?
You knew?
Naturally when Mr. Field recommended you,
he told me everything.
We agreed that old scandals
might be forgotten in your case.
- It was you, Henry?
- Miss Haines...
...would you allow me to speak
to Mademoiselle Desportes?
Certainly. And I hope whatever
you decide will be for the best.
It isn't any use, Henry.
Though you've done me this last kindness,
even you must realize it is hopeless.
"Conciergerie."
That girl asked me how
to spell Conciergerie. That child...
All that is past.
No. It's crossed the ocean
and followed me.
It's down there in that schoolroom now
in the way that girl looked at me.
Henry, I have nothing left
to fight with anymore.
Yes, you have.
If you could only see yourself
as I know you can be.
Proud, looking up with clear eyes,
ashamed of nothing.
If you can face your conscience,
you can face those children.
And don't beg for their respect,
demand it.
If I only had your courage.
Please.
Please, Henriette.
I suppose I owe it to you to try.
Mademoiselle Deluzy.
This sign will teach her a lesson.
- Why do they call her Mademoiselle D?
- Her name is Desportes or Deluzy.
- I wonder if the duke was as handsome...
- Shh. Here she is.
The rest of the lesson today
will be conducted in English.
You may lay aside your books,
for it is to be entirely oral.
I am going to tell you a true story.
Perhaps I am wrong in telling it to you...
...but in a few years you will be women
of an age to love and suffer...
...and face difficult problems.
So it will not hurt you to learn...
...that life is not always the pretty picture
we might wish it to be.
If there are any of you
who do not wish to hear my story...
...you have my permission to leave now.
Very well, then.
All I ask is that you give me
your whole attention.
For most of our story we will be in Paris,
in a large and beautiful house...
...which is the residence
of the Duc and the Duchesse de Praslin.
It is of the governess in this household
which I will tell you.
On a February morning some years ago,
she had not yet arrived in Paris...
...whence she had been summoned
for an interview.
It was a passenger on a
steamer which was making its way...
... across the foggy English Channel
from Southampton toward Le Havre.
In the bag she carried was a letter
of recommendation from her last employer.
She could not know into what unexpected
adventure the letter would carry her.
And even more, how another letter would
one day bring her world down in ruins.
She only knew that one cycle of her
life was past and another beginning.
And she looked forward toward the distant,
invisible shores of her native country...
... with mingled feelings of hope
and apprehension.
She was traveling alone.
She had learned long since
to look after herself...
... and if she was lonely, she hoped
that nothing in her manner gave it away.
I beg your pardon.
Do you mind if I talk to you?
Since we seem to be the only ones
hardy enough to brave the deck.
Please, believe me, I've never gone up
to speak to a stranger before.
If I've offended you,
if you want me to go away, I will.
I saw you first on the dock
at Southampton.
How sad those people were
when they said goodbye to you.
After five years, it is difficult to part
from those you love.
I was sad for them, I don't know why.
That little girl, how bitterly she wept.
That was Nina. I was her governess.
And when the gentleman took your hand
and wished you happiness...
...the oddest feeling came over me.
You were a perfect stranger to me,
and yet l...
I found myself wishing with all my heart
that you would be happy.
I suppose you think that's ridiculous.
Naturally.
And yet it's true
that you're not happy now.
It's in your face and in your manner.
You're unhappy and resigned to it.
Well, a person in my position
must be content...
...with picking up a few crumbs
of happiness from others' tables.
- Now I'm sure you'll excuse me.
- Oh, please don't go.
I know I've been impertinent and rude...
...but I promise I won't probe
any further.
I will talk about
the most innocent generalities.
In fact, I'll talk about myself.
- I'm an American.
- I rather guessed that.
From Massachusetts.
My name is Field. Henry Field.
And there's a "Martyn" in the middle
and a "Reverend" that goes in front.
You are a minister.
Well, I'm not exactly
a full-fledged minister yet.
I haven't taken a regular pastorate.
But my father's a minister
and I preached my first sermon...
...when I was 15
in one of his cut-down coats.
Just now I'm broadening myself
with some travel.
I don't suppose broadening
will hurt a minister, do you?
I'm sorry, but we dock soon.
The luggage is being sorted in the lounge.
Yes. Thank you.
- If you'll excuse me?
- But I don't even know your name.
Where will I ever find you?
Well, I really don't know
where I'll be myself.
Goodbye, monsieur.
You're not thinking of joining
this household, mademoiselle?
I hope to be the new governess.
Hope, you say?
Heh. You'd not enter this house
of your own free will.
- You find that amusing?
- Yes, quite amusing.
You see, young lady,
I'm old Pierre, the handyman.
And I not only sweep the courtyard, but
I wash the windows and see a good deal.
I could tell you things. So many things.
- I am expected.
- Follow me, mademoiselle.
Everyone knows the pleasure
you take in humiliating me.
I have no wish to humiliate you,
Frances. My decision...
Isn't every day of my life a humiliation?
Theo, I'm your wife.
We're both young and yet we live...
Frances, in the name of your pride.
Come in.
Mademoiselle Henriette Desportes.
Yes?
Madame la Duchesse.
I trust I am not too early.
Really? What time is it?
You asked me for 11, madame,
but if I am inconveniencing you...
Please make yourself comfortable,
mademoiselle.
Thank you, Monsieur le Duc.
- Allow me.
- Thank you.
Allow me to express my gratitude
for the compliment you've paid...
...in summoning me
to discuss your children's education.
I sent you my letter
of reference yesterday.
I hope you found it satisfactory.
The reference. Oh, yes, quite so.
As I remember, it was excellent.
There must, of course, be much more
you would wish to know about me.
I, for my part, should wish to know
more about the children...
...before I could assume such
a responsibility.
The requirements are about the same as
your last position, Mademoiselle Desportes.
We want a governess to take full charge
of the children's education...
...to supervise their music,
drawing and behavior.
I'm afraid they'll be quite a handful.
We have three girls.
They might be a little difficult.
You see, they are from 8 to 13.
I understand, monsieur.
Then there is a boy...
...who was born...
...some years later.
Raynald, who is not quite 4.
He's a bright little fellow,
but his health...
Raynald is sensitive like me.
For years before he was born
I was made unhappy and ill.
- He will bear the marks of my suffering.
- Frances, please.
I think we can bring this interview
to a close, Mademoiselle Desportes.
In view of your excellent reference...
...a trial of the post is yours
if you would like it.
Before you commit yourself, monsieur...
...I was expected to provide a letter
of guarantee from my grandfather...
...my only living relative.
I'm sorry, he has refused it.
Isn't that rather strange?
Your own grandfather?
And furthermore...
This is very awkward.
If I come here, I shall have to ask you to
call me by some other name than Desportes.
Am I to understand that your name
is not Desportes?
My grandfather, the Baron Desportes,
received his title from Napoleon.
So naturally, he is opposed
to my associating myself in a household...
...of such prominent friends
of the present king.
I must say this is...
This is an awkward situation,
Mademoiselle...
Deluzy.
I chose that name
to keep my initials intact.
So this is what happens
when you want to make a change, Theo.
We're to take someone in
to teach disloyalty to our children?
I give you my word, madame...
...I would not allow my political beliefs
to affect my teachings of your children.
But if...
If these things make a difference in
your feeling, I will understand.
Oh, that must be the children.
I had asked Mademoiselle Maillard
to bring them by.
Does that seem necessary now, Theo?
- Good morning, Papa.
- Is this our new governess, Papa?
- You didn't come to dinner last night.
- I finished my lesson...
Children, children.
Not so much noise.
Your poor mother's nerves.
- Mademoiselle Maillard.
- Yes, monsieur?
This is Mademoiselle Deluzy.
- Very pleased.
- How do you do?
- I do hope you're better today.
- Come, children, make your curtsies.
This long-legged colt is Isabelle,
the eldest.
Mademoiselle Isabelle.
You are already a young lady.
And my little Louise.
Mademoiselle Louise.
What lovely hair for curling.
May I curl my hair?
Mademoiselle Maillard...
Not one of you children has so much as said
good morning to your mother.
- Good morning, Mother.
- Good morning.
And where's Berthe?
Here I am, mademoiselle.
Good heavens, child,
don't spill Mama's ink.
I'm not spilling, I'm drawing.
Well, give that to me.
How many times have I told you
not to touch the things on Mama's desk?
Such a beautiful child.
A little headstrong,
but very lovable if one can win her over.
Raynald.
Raynald, come away from there at once.
You bad, bad boy
to pick Mama's flowers.
Just for that you'll stay home tonight.
And for supper, no baba.
Not one spoonful.
Whatever made you do a thing like that?
It's for mademoiselle to put on her dress.
Oh, that was kind, Raynald,
a very kind thought.
But you should have asked
permission first.
Perhaps if you ask her now,
she'll let you give it to me.
But I picked it
for the new mademoiselle...
...because she has pink ribbons
in her bonnet.
Mademoiselle Maillard,
let him give it to her...
...and take them all out of here.
As you wish, madame. Come, Raynald.
Thank you, Raynald.
But since it is your mother's flower,
wouldn't it be nicer if you gave it to her?
See how pretty it will look in her dress.
I'll pretend I'm wearing it here
when I go out.
All right, Raynald?
Yes, mademoiselle.
Here, Mama, it's for you.
Thank you, Raynald.
All right, children,
back to the schoolroom.
Mademoiselle Maillard, Isabelle, Louise,
Berthe, all of you.
I'll see you at lunch time.
- Don't forget to come to dinner.
- You promised to go riding.
Quickly, quick.
Well, Mademoiselle Deluzy...
...one never knows how a new person
will fit into a household...
...but I like your way with children
and they seem to like you.
Would it be possible for you to report
in the morning?
It is very kind of you, monsieur.
But I feel I could not come at all without
madame's approval as well as yours.
Oh, it really doesn't concern me
one way or the other.
Monsieur has taken over
the children's education.
He knows I was satisfied
with Mademoiselle Maillard...
...since she's proved her loyalty
and affection.
I hope you won't mind if she stays
on with me as my personal attendant.
Until tomorrow then, mademoiselle.
And I hope you will stay with us
for a long time.
Thank you, monsieur.
Mademoiselle Deluzy.
Yes, madame?
How old are you?
Twenty-five, madame.
So young.
- This way.
Don't trouble, monsieur.
I will find my way out.
- Good day, madame.
Good day.
Monsieur.
Don't leave me, Theo.
Oh, how angry you are with me.
- I'm late at the palace.
- But I must talk to you. I never see you.
The king expects me.
Does the touch of my hands
fill you with aversion?
- Really...
- It must be aversion...
...since you avoid me, never willingly
give me a moment's thought or attention.
I have no wish to avoid you, Frances.
I would talk to you by the hour if we
could do so with calmness and sanity.
- But it always ends the same.
- Wait, Theo.
Wait. Oh, how cruel you are, my darling.
Take the children, take them.
I care nothing about them,
about anyone but you.
Theo, if I promise never again...
...to torment you
with my anger and mistrust...
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Theo.
Theo. Theo, come back, please.
Theo, come back. I beg you.
I hate you.
I loathe you.
You're wicked, wicked, wicked.
- Oh, Father Gallard.
- Have patience, my child.
"And one day, when the little princess
was walking in the royal gardens...
...she noticed a lovely pink rose which she
could not remember having seen before.
As she leaned to smell its fragrance,
it suddenly dissolved into thin air.
And there in its place stood
the fairy godmother.
And the fairy godmother spoke
to the princess and said:
'My child, you have been kind and good
and I have come to reward you.
Now I have only one gift
to bestow upon you...
...so mark my words well.
For once your choice is made,
it cannot be changed.
It is within my power
to give you happiness...
...while you are young,
or happiness when you are old.
Which shall it be? '
The princess pondered in deep thought.
'It is a hard choice, dear godmother.
But if I spend my share of happiness
while I am young...
...then I shall have nothing left
to look forward to.
So let me have my happiness
when I am old...
...and may heaven send me patience.'
The godmother then embraced her.
'You have made a wise choice.
And you will not regret it, dear.
Go now with my blessing."'
Do you agree
that she made the right choice?
Papa.
- Come. I asked you a question.
- When did you come in?
Louise, was the princess right to wait
until she was old to get her happiness?
No, I think she was foolish
to wait so long.
Couldn't she ask for a little when she was
young and a little when she was old?
Ha-ha-ha.
Berthe shows early signs of diplomacy.
But it's not so easy as all that.
Is it, mademoiselle?
No, it is not so easy as all that,
monsieur.
Happiness isn't a little cake
which we can cut up to fit our appetite.
Doesn't mademoiselle read
beautifully, Papa?
She doesn't read like a mademoiselle,
does she?
I would say the great Rachel
herself could not read better.
Oh, Papa. Rachel.
Will you take me to see her
on stage some day?
You'd like to see Rachel, wouldn't you?
I would very much. I never have.
- But I'm afraid this isn't any time...
- Oh, please, Papa.
Perhaps.
Now I should not be interrupting.
It's time for lessons again.
Isn't it, mademoiselle?
It certainly is.
The girls have their history...
...and Raynald is about to retire into a
corner with his alphabet and his sniffles.
What's this? Sniffles?
How did you get the sniffles?
Raynald didn't invite them, Papa.
- They just came.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Well, send them away then, the same
way mademoiselle is about to send me.
Oh, don't go, Papa.
Mademoiselle doesn't mind.
Why don't you stay as you often do?
Unfortunately, the House of Peers
is meeting this afternoon.
Your father has to make a speech about
the advantages of a treaty with Turkey.
- A speech?
- Let Turkey wait.
- May we come and hear you?
- Perhaps, if I make a very good speech...
...mademoiselle will allow me
to come along on your walk in the park.
- What is it, Pierre?
- The carriage is ready.
Oh, yes.
Mademoiselle, I'd like to talk to you.
Yes, monsieur.
Isabelle, take care of Raynald, will you?
Louise, Berthe, get out your books.
Yes, mademoiselle.
Come, Raynald.
- Yes, monsieur?
- Tell me, please...
...about these sniffles.
Is it a cold, do you think?
It is too early to say.
He will be all right.
I'll keep him in today.
- Good. Mademoiselle?
- Yes, monsieur?
There is something I wanted to tell you.
If I have fallen short in any way,
monsieur...
Do you know, we had almost forgotten
what peace was...
...until you came into this house.
I can't tell you how much it means to me.
But, really, monsieur,
they're such good children.
How foolish my fears seem now.
- Fears, monsieur?
- About you. Because you were a stranger.
From now on,
my fear will be that some day...
...you will leave us.
Oh, I would not be so foolish
as that, monsieur.
For as long as the children need me
and you wish me to stay.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Berthe, my darling, the song
is to learn history to, not to dance to.
Yes, mademoiselle. I didn't mean to.
I'm very sorry.
And, Louise, you are old enough
to know better.
But, mademoiselle, it's so hard to remember
things that happened so long ago...
...and way over in England, not France.
When I taught an English girl
French history, she said the same thing.
The war of the Roses is very simple
if you just learn the song.
The king's coat of arms had the red rose
of Lancaster for an emblem...
...and the queen's,
the white rose of York.
I know. Just like Mama and Papa.
She had a crest of her own
before she married him.
Only his was better than hers.
- Mama had the most money.
- Not when they were married.
She has now.
At least Grandfather Sebastiani has.
He owns this house. He only lets us
live here because Papa married Mama.
That's true, mademoiselle.
I'll bet it makes Papa simply furious...
Now, now, Louise. Some other time.
We must finish our song.
Berthe, my darling, come here.
There.
I apologize for intruding on your domain,
Mademoiselle Deluzy.
But, madame, on the contrary,
we wish you would visit us more often.
I'm only here now because I was
sure this is where I would find monsieur.
- He spends so much time with the children.
- He left, Mother.
- He's gone to make a speech.
- About Turkey.
So I see he lets his plans
be known in the schoolroom.
Will it please you to sit down
and join us in our lesson?
No, not at all.
I'd planned on taking a drive with monsieur.
Well, I'm not going out alone
for all the world to see.
Dress Raynald.
I'll be waiting in the carriage.
I'm sorry, madame.
Raynald can't go out this afternoon.
What did you say?
He has coughed once or twice.
It may be a cold.
Do I understand that you forbid me
to take Raynald, Mademoiselle Deluzy?
No, madame. But it is such a raw
afternoon and monsieur himself...
Is it among the authorities
conferred on you by monsieur...
...that you dictate to me
concerning my own children?
Not at all, madame.
If I spoke hastily
it was out of concern for Raynald.
Sincerely, I meant no offense.
If you would choose one of the other...
- Mademoiselle Maillard?
Yes, madame?
Dress Raynald at once.
I will dress Raynald, madame.
But, mademoiselle, please.
- Just think, you're taking Papa's place.
A lady needs a gentleman
to accompany her.
Oh, no, Raynald, the other seat.
- You'll spoil my dress.
- No, Mama, please.
Pardon me. Raynald tells me
it makes him ill to ride backwards.
Childish nonsense. Go on, Albert.
It's a wise chicken that runs to cover
at the first clap of thunder.
Don't you think so, mademoiselle?
She made me ride backwards all the way
and when I got sick she scolded me.
Yes, cheri, I know, I know.
But it's not worth crying about.
Such a little thing isn't worth tears.
What is this I hear from madame
about Raynald?
She made me ride backwards, Papa.
- He is suffering a slight chill.
- Yes, I know. You told me this morning.
Yes. It would have been better
had he not gone out.
Most certainly. Why did you allow it?
- I did suggest that with his cough...
- Next time, do more than suggest.
But when his own mother says...
I've made you responsible
for my children.
There is to be no questioning
your authority.
You place me in a very difficult position.
You know how such authority
would be resented.
Papa? Papa?
Are you angry with mademoiselle?
No.
No, Raynald.
I'm not angry with mademoiselle.
I'm very sorry.
I understand, monsieur.
I know what the children mean to you.
Pardon me.
I've spoken to the duchess.
I think she understands
what I've just told you.
You see, we must realize
that she is sometimes overimpulsive.
Her affections run away
with her judgment.
I appreciate your confidence, monsieur.
And Raynald is such
a strong little fellow.
He will be quite himself by tomorrow.
- Won't you, darling?
- I'll be better tomorrow, mademoiselle.
This hurts, Raynald, I know,
but just once more.
- Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle.
- I'm here, darling.
There. We're all finished.
That wasn't so bad, was it, now?
Poor little fellow.
The treatment for diphtheria
is always painful, monsieur.
Mademoiselle.
I want the compress right back.
- Yes, doctor.
- The throat is badly inflamed.
We can only hope to check it
from spreading.
He must be kept quiet and calm.
What about the other children?
They're leaving at once
for their grandfather's in Corsica.
Good. I'll be back this evening.
Remember what I told
about the windows.
- Oh, yes, yes. Of course, doctor.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mademoiselle, it hurts my neck.
There we are. See, Raynald?
Now, you're wearing a stock like Papa's.
And here is some chocolate.
No, no. I don't want it.
All right, Maxine. You may go.
Be patient, darling.
You'll feel better in a little while.
If you would bring Raynald his mirror...
...he could see for himself
how grown-up he looks.
He'll be getting a tall hat
and a cane before we know it.
Thank you, monsieur. There.
Now show Papa how nice
you can smile when you want to.
See, monsieur? You can't say Raynald
isn't a brave little man.
And now we're going to have
our dejeuner on a tray...
...just like your mother has hers.
No, no. It hurts my neck.
Let's forget about the chocolate, then.
Here's a tangerine.
And as I peel it, you must guess
how many pieces there are.
Do you know how many?
No, but we'll soon see.
Now, come on.
Let's count.
- One.
- One.
- Two.
- Two.
- And three.
- Three.
It is not my place to suggest, but might it
be better if I stayed here with Raynald...
...and let someone else
take the girls away?
Ten, 11, 12.
Now, let's try this one first.
It's nice and cool.
Just let the juice run down your throat.
I thought I could get someone
from one of the hospitals.
There. That didn't hurt very much, did it?
- Not very much.
- No. Now, here's another.
I'm sure I could follow
the doctor's treatment.
That's very, very kind of you,
mademoiselle.
I'll send the girls away
with Maxine, then.
My head is loose, mademoiselle.
Will it fall off like Berthe's doll
that got left in the rain...
...and all the sawdust ran out?
No. We'll hold it on tight.
Besides, your head isn't filled
with sawdust.
It's full of good sense and bravery.
Will I die
and have to take nasty medicine?
What an idea.
You'll have to take medicine
to make you better.
But we don't think about dying.
But my white rabbit died.
And I loved it better
than the brown one that didn't.
Hush, my darling.
You're going to sleep now.
Yes, mademoiselle.
It seems a shame to shut out
the air and the sunlight...
...especially
with the warm spring coming.
Yes, it does seem a shame.
But the doctor says that...
Yes, I know, monsieur.
Mademoiselle.
I want you to know...
...how grateful I am
for what you're doing.
When madame understands,
I'm sure she will be grateful too.
I'll be back in a little while.
Amen.
He is too little to be frightened.
Monsieur, Mademoiselle Deluzy.
Dr. Louis?
Yes, madame?
Shouldn't I go in too?
No. I think it would be wise not to.
I'm afraid you might upset him.
I, upset him?
I mean, there's great danger of infection.
I'm only speaking for your good.
How dare you.
Isn't a mother's place by her husband
at the bedside of her child?
There's nothing you can do.
Think of your own health.
Why should I consider myself?
No one else does.
Either my wishes or my health, anything.
Now, now, my dear.
Your welfare is most important to all of us.
Father. If you'll go to your room,
I'll see you later.
My room.
I suppose that's where
they'd like me to stay.
Watch him, keep him quiet
and well covered.
That is all any of us can do now.
I expect the ultimate change
for better or worse before night.
We can only hope that his strength
will carry him through the crisis.
Yes, monsieur. Believe me it will.
But he has no strength.
He's always been frail with a frailness
that is a reproach to me.
Why do you say that, monsieur?
Do you remember that first day you came?
I spoke of three children.
And then of one
who was born several years later.
- Yes.
- Does that not tell you all there is to know?
That he's a symbol of cold embers which
should never have been revived even for...
Monsieur, please.
I'd rather you didn't.
Theo?
Oh. Father Gallard.
I hoped it might be Theo.
I've come to bring you
what comfort I can.
What comfort can there be for me
in a house where I'm pushed aside like dirt?
Oh, Father, I don't know how much longer
I can endure this agony.
Have patience, my child.
Humiliate your soul and endure
with calm the delays of God.
The days I spend alone
thinking only of him.
The nights I weep.
My tears mix with the ink
as I write him letters.
Letters with only the barest hope
that he'll so much as read them.
I stand outside of his doorway not daring
to enter for fear he'll reproach me.
Gold and silver are purified by fire...
...but those who God receives as his
are proved by humiliation and sorrow.
You're my father confessor
and in you I truly confide.
We're still young, Theo and I,
and yet for three years we've lived...
Oh, Father, is it a sin for me
to love a man so much?
Marriage is sanctified in the fullness
of the claims between man and woman.
Well, then tell him that he's wicked,
that he sins.
Only I'm repulsed. Even a governess
can come and go where she chooses.
It may be the necessities
of Raynald's illness.
No. She's not repulsed.
She receives him in his dressing gown
in her room.
Or she's in his.
I'll not have my place in this house
usurped by that woman, that servant.
Day and night, at any hour, those two,
they're always together.
Don't be too despairing, monsieur.
Crisis must come sometime.
Only I wish...
Mademoiselle?
Yes, darling.
It's too dark in here.
May I see the garden?
The doctor thinks not yet, darling.
Perhaps, tomorrow.
What is it he wants so much?
He complains of the dark
and the closeness.
It is stifling.
He won't believe me when I tell him
how green the garden has grown.
And that the almond tree
is really in bloom.
He begs to look out,
and if I had my way, I'd let him.
Please.
Please. The garden, Papa.
Sick or well, we're not meant
to suffocate in this world.
Just the one time.
- Please.
- It's a very mild day, monsieur.
And such a little thing to ask.
It will give him a new interest in life
to see the garden.
After all, sun and air are good
for every living thing.
I don't know why I should have more
confidence in your word...
...only the doctor's...
...yet I do.
- Thank you, monsieur.
There we are. Papa will carry you.
- All right, my boy.
- Yes.
We're going to take a look at the garden.
No weight at all.
See, Raynald?
The almond tree breathes in the sunshine
and the warm spring air.
And every day it grows more strong
and beautiful.
And that is how you must grow,
strong and beautiful.
Theo. Are you mad?
Do you want to kill him, mademoiselle?
Theo. Let me go. You're hurting me.
Let me go. Let me go.
- Then do go.
- If he dies tonight it'll be your punishment.
God will visit his revenge on this house.
Come, darling.
We will look at the almond tree again
tomorrow...
...if you'll promise to try to get well
as hard as you can.
Look, mademoiselle. Look. You see?
I can run faster than Papa now.
Of course you can, darling.
Isn't it wonderful, mademoiselle?
Yes, it is wonderful, but let's not have
too much running for the first day.
Ha-ha. He's completely
out of hand, mademoiselle.
- Isn't he?
- Mademoiselle...
...why don't you come down?
May I come in, mademoiselle?
- Yes.
This is from madame.
Madame, I hope I have not come
at an inopportune moment.
But I could not wait any longer
to say my thanks for your charming gift.
The brooch? Oh, yes.
A small souvenir.
I'm glad if it pleases you.
I would appreciate very much
a few words with you alone.
Really? Well, I'm quite busy now.
The duke and I are going away together
this afternoon.
I hope you find the children
well and happy.
Yes, we're going to Corsica to join them.
The duke and I.
- I will not keep you long.
Raynald.
- Is that his voice?
Give me the ball.
- Yes. He's playing with Raynald.
- Mademoiselle Maillard?
- Yes, madame?
- Ask him to come here.
Yes, madame.
You know, the poor man
can hardly wait to get away...
...from everything.
I have felt for a long time...
...the need of coming
to a closer understanding with you.
Your kind message
and this expression of your goodwill...
...made me feel
this was the right moment.
Really, I've never felt the need
for any conversation with you.
It is just that I wish harmony
between us above all things.
Even during Raynald's illness, I couldn't
help but feel some resentment...
...some disapproval...
Mademoiselle, since by some miracle
Raynald has survived...
...and according to your notions,
you've tended him faithfully...
...let us say no more about it.
Madame, even though
the children are under monsieur's charge...
...I would like very much
to follow your wishes too.
Then I can only repeat what any woman
has a right to expect:
That she come first in her own house,
with her own children...
...and with her husband.
But truly, madame, no other thought
has ever been in my mind.
If I have overstepped my position,
it has been unintentional.
And I assure you I'll be more careful
in the future.
The future?
Oh?
Yes.
Who knows?
Mademoiselle?
Yes, my little sleepyhead?
I wish we didn't have to go south
next week.
I wish Papa would come here.
I miss Papa, don't you, mademoiselle?
Yes, Raynald.
I miss Papa and Mama too.
I don't very much.
What a thoughtless thing to say.
Mama loves you very much.
Didn't she send you a box of toy soldiers
only yesterday?
- She makes me ride backwards.
- Such a little thing.
You don't make me ride backwards,
but I think I could if you asked me to.
I think I could right now.
Darling, I wish you wouldn't even try.
But I want to show you.
It really isn't necessary.
Henriette knows you love her.
I won't get sick, I won't get sick.
I won't, I won't, I won't.
Pierre, I'm riding backwards.
What do you think of that?
Who has arrived home?
That's for me to know
and you to find out.
I didn't get sick a bit.
Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle.
We came home.
Louise.
Papa.
- Papa.
- Well, well. How is my little boy?
I rode backwards.
You did? How wonderful.
Mademoiselle. How have you been?
Don't you notice anything,
mademoiselle?
- Why, whatever...
- Look at me.
- What happened?
- It's my tooth. It ached and ached.
And Papa said he'd bring me to the dentist.
Mama said to go to one there...
...but Papa said
he wouldn't trust anyone but Dupont.
I did it for mademoiselle,
all the way home from the park.
Raynald looks splendid.
Listen. When you take me to the dentist,
if I'm very brave...
...Papa has promised a surprise.
We planned it and you'll never guess.
I didn't get sick one bit,
did I, mademoiselle?
Guess. We'll wear our best clothes, sit
in a box and not go to bed until midnight.
Now can't you guess?
I remembered you'd never seen Rachel.
Did I, mademoiselle?
Oh, but how kind.
Mademoiselle,
why don't you tell Papa I didn't?
It was Papa's idea.
She plays tomorrow night.
And it's the last time
she appears as Phedre.
After that she's going back to England...
...where you came from.
Didn't I, mademoiselle?
Look. I didn't know
the Duc de Praslin was in town.
Flowers, mademoiselle.
Just think. Isn't it thrilling?
Isn't it perfect to be out with a handsome
man like Papa who buys us flowers?
Thank you.
Here is a program, mademoiselle.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, monsieur.
I wonder who she is.
A friend of the duchess, do you suppose?
They have a most attractive
governess in that house.
If they have, and they seem to have,
she is most attractive.
I mean, as a governess.
I'm so excited
I can hardly read my program.
Now aren't you glad I made you wear
your new dress?
She doesn't look like a governess at all,
does she?
- Not at all.
- Louise.
I wonder what brought the duke back
to Paris so suddenly.
I heard the duchess was in Corsica
alone with her father.
Yes?
How very convenient.
Papa. Mademoiselle.
Look, isn't that the king?
Yes, darling.
Look, mademoiselle. He's greeting us.
Do sit down.
I think I'm going to die right here.
Imagine, my first visit to the theater...
...the king bows to me,
and look, everyone is staring at us.
Louise, the curtain is about to go up.
Why the music, mademoiselle? I thought
they only played music in the opera.
It's a musical prologue.
Now, quiet, darling, please.
Yes, mademoiselle.
- I beg your pardon.
- What is it, mademoiselle?
Nothing, monsieur, nothing.
I just wondered about the noise.
Sorry to have disturbed you, monsieur.
Good night.
Don't stop, Papa.
I love to dance with you.
- It's late, dear. I better say good night.
- Oh, Papa.
- It's long past midnight, Louise.
- Must we stop?
It's been so wonderful.
Thank you, Papa.
Thank you, dear mademoiselle.
Now I'm sorry I threw away my violets.
But I was so excited
and the others threw theirs.
Even you, mademoiselle,
you threw yours.
But I wish I'd kept them
to remember tonight.
May your gentleman offer his flower
as a substitute?
You're so nice, Papa. Thank you.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Papa.
May I thank you, monsieur?
I enjoyed it so much.
I'm glad you did.
I must say that for myself,
I prefer comedy.
It's a sign of getting old, they say,
but I can't help it.
There is tragedy enough in the world.
I don't think we have to buy our tears.
- Good night, mademoiselle.
- Good night, monsieur.
Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle?
Yes, Louise?
Do you know what, mademoiselle?
I was just thinking.
I'm going to give you the flower.
- Oh, no, dear.
Yes, mademoiselle.
You know, we'd never had such
a good time before you came.
We never had anything like this.
Even Papa was never so gay.
Yes, you take the flower, mademoiselle.
Papa gave it to you
and I think you should keep it.
- But believe me, mademoiselle.
- All right.
Suppose we keep it till morning
and press it in a book.
Oh, I know what I'll do.
I'll put it in my diary under the date
of June the 11 th, 1846.
- Why, darling?
- Because that's today.
And you know what I'll write under it?
"This was the happiest day of my life."
You're so excited. Wouldn't you like me
to sit with you for a while?
No, thank you.
Somehow or other I'd rather be alone.
- Good night, dear mademoiselle.
- Good night, Louise.
- Mademoiselle.
- Yes, Louise?
I just wanted to tell you
I love you almost as much as Papa.
And I love you too very much, darling.
- Sleep well.
- I will.
We expected to stay until September,
but Mama told us...
...that we were coming home that day.
I haven't the least idea why,
but she seemed all upset.
She'd get angry and then she'd cry.
Then Grandfather Sebastiani
would pat her hand.
- Oh, I'm glad to see you.
- I am too, mademoiselle.
I've missed you both very much.
Do you know why Grandfather Sebastiani
came back with us?
How would I, Isabelle?
There's something very funny about it
because he hasn't been here for years.
On the train, whenever he and the abbe
and Mama had their heads together...
...and one of us came,
they'd say, "Shh. The children."
And talk about the scenery.
- Mademoiselle Deluzy?
- Yes?
The Marechal Sebastiani
is waiting to see you in his apartment.
Why do you suppose Grandfather
wants to see you?
Well, I'll tell you better
after I know myself.
Keep yourselves busy while I am gone.
It's almost bedtime, you know.
- I wonder why he wants to see her.
- Do you think something's wrong?
There must be or Grandfather Sebastiani
wouldn't have sent for her.
Come in.
Madame la Duchesse.
- Hope you had a pleasant journey.
- I did. Thank you.
- Father Gallard.
- Mademoiselle Deluzy.
I am the Marechal Sebastiani.
I am very pleased to meet you.
I have heard so much from the children.
I too have enjoyed the same sort
of acquaintance with you, mademoiselle.
I could have hoped...
...that our meeting might have occurred
under pleasanter circumstances.
Oh, Father, let's get this over with.
Mademoiselle Deluzy...
...has this newspaper article
come to your attention?
We are waiting for your explanation.
One evening, as governess,
I accompanied Louise and her father...
...to dinner and the theater.
Does that require an explanation?
Do you realize what this means?
There are people who write trash
and others who read it.
You've made a deliberate effort to steal
away from me everything that I love.
But that you dared plan this last insult.
You flaunted your influence
over my husband for the king...
...and all of Paris to see.
Let me speak for myself, madame.
I resent the slander as much,
or more than you.
Do you realize what this slander,
as you call it, implies?
- It is clear.
- You admit it.
I admit nothing.
If you do not choose to believe me,
then you must believe facts.
This house, which is infested
by Mademoiselle Maillard and your spies.
- Every movement is known.
- What do you mean?
Just a moment, Frances,
let us not be hasty.
Well, perhaps there's been nothing
actually wrong between you.
I have too much faith to believe
he would abandon himself with a servant.
If your actions have that appearance,
it might as well be so.
There is every difference
between appearance and fact, madame.
If as this article implies...
...it appears that you and monsieur
are not on good terms...
...are we also to accept that as a fact?
What?
I'll not tolerate this any longer.
Nor will I, madame.
- Have I your permission to leave now?
- Not yet.
Come in.
I'm sorry,
but madame asked me to tell her.
Mademoiselle Deluzy,
my daughter means a great deal to me.
I haven't been able
to buy her happiness...
...I intend to spare her
all the humiliation I can.
We must find a way out
of this difficult situation.
Monsieur, it is so simple.
I will pack my trunk.
That would be as unwise as it is hasty.
Why? Since the duchess makes no secret
of her dissatisfaction with me.
Since it is her happiness
which is your only concern.
Were you to leave now,
it would give credence to this gossip.
My son and daughter
will be seen together more often in public.
And this gossip will die away.
You will live here, apparently on the best
of terms with both of them...
...and all I require is your promise
of more prudent conduct in the future.
I assure you my conduct will be
no concern of yours in the future.
Isn't it enough you humiliate me at home?
Must you do it in public as well?
The entire court, all of Paris
is talking about it.
They know you have a wife
and you say in your actions...
...as plainly as you could in words
that you prefer a servant.
Isn't it enough that she's a governess
without making her your companion?
Theo, you must put an end to it.
Mademoiselle, you mustn't leave.
You shouldn't have come here.
There is enough trouble already.
- I beg of you to remember the children.
- Don't, monsieur.
Raynald owes you his life. Louise, Berthe,
Isabelle, who have learned to trust you.
- They are young. They will forget.
- How...?
There are some things
it is useless to fight against...
...and one of them
is another woman's jealousy.
She hates me.
Believe me, it will be better for all of us.
She will be happier.
- And perhaps in time, you and she...
- Never.
She loves you, monsieur.
What kind of love
that drives one to madness?
If she tortures you and others,
it is because she is goaded by her passion.
Being a woman too,
I can understand that.
I hope you will never understand
what it is to be smothered by a love...
...which has become insufferable.
I shouldn't have presumed
to speak about love at all.
- I have no right and I ask you to forget it.
- I'm glad you did.
I've wanted you to know.
It's always the same.
Demanding, demanding, letters, tears.
I live in fear I shall be driven
to do something desperate.
- You mustn't even think such things.
- I know. I know what I'm asking.
I know the slights and humiliation
you will have to put up with.
For myself, I shall do what I can
to make it easier.
I'll give them their pretense
of reconciliation.
Their precious appearances
they think so important.
Mademoiselle, you haven't it in your heart
to deny the children and me...
...the only sanctuary we have.
But, monsieur,
I've always had to fend for myself.
- And it's taught me to be practical and...
- well, let's be practical, then.
She's only one reason
to make you want to go...
...and there are five reasons
to keep you here.
- Five?
- Yes, mademoiselle.
Four young ones and their father.
Shall I count them on my fingers for you?
No, monsieur, you needn't trouble.
You have asked me and that is enough.
If you had tried to bribe
or drive a bargain with me...
...I shouldn't be yielding
against my better judgment.
To be loved as you are in this house
is above all bargains.
Isn't it wonderful?
There, look. Just coming in.
It's Victor Hugo.
When I grow up,
I'm going to give a ball.
And there's La Martin, the great poet.
He's talking to Chopin.
- Oh, I hope he'll play tonight.
- The king hasn't arrived yet, has he?
Not yet, silly.
Everyone will be here, even Rachel.
I saw Rachel. You know that, don't you?
Oh, yes, we heard about that.
Oh, look over there. It's Papa.
There's no one here
who dances as beautifully as Papa.
Doesn't Papa look handsome?
I wish I could dance with him.
- I danced with him.
- You did?
Yes. Look, this is how he held me.
What are you doing? I put Raynald to bed
and looked everywhere for you.
- Don't be angry.
- Dear, mademoiselle, it's so exciting.
We were only looking.
- In your nighties too.
- Nobody's seen us.
Only Papa. He looked up once.
I know he saw us.
Then he looked right away again
with the oddest look, so Ionely.
Mademoiselle, why doesn't Papa
come to the nursery anymore?
Yes, why doesn't he?
Well, he does whenever he can.
Not as he used to.
Never to have fun anymore.
Sometimes he comes in with Mama
and asks ever so politely about our studies.
Mademoiselle, why isn't Papa happy,
do you know?
Well, you see,
your father is working very hard.
These are troublesome days
for the kingdom.
And so sometimes if he appears worried
and a little strange...
...it is because he has such big problems
of state on his mind.
Well, Mama is much pleasanter
and I guess we can't have every...
Mademoiselle, look, the king.
- Your Majesty.
- Darling.
I want him to bow,
then Berthe and Isabelle will believe me.
Now come along.
You've seen the king.
Maxine is waiting to wash your faces.
Scamper along.
Mademoiselle, is the king a bad man?
Pierre says the people will cut off his head.
He is not bad.
He's Papa's friend and he's my friend.
Yes, and he's mademoiselle's too.
Mademoiselle, do you think it's the king
who stops Papa from coming here?
Berthe, your father is a peer of France...
...and has a great many responsibilities
to attend to.
Mademoiselle, when I grow up,
do you think I'll be a peer of France?
