(dramatic music)
- It's intensely contemplative.
It is almost hypnotic.
It's like putting your hand
on the third rail
of the universe.
If you play Go seriously,
there is a chance that
you will get exposed
to this experience
that is kind of like
nothing else on the planet.
Go is putting you in a
place where you're always
at the very farthest
reaches of your capacity.
There's a reason that
people have been playing Go
for thousands and
thousands of years, right?
It's not just that they
wanna understand Go.
They wanna understand
what understanding is.
And maybe that is truly
what it means to be human.
- When I was a kid I
loved playing games.
I started off with
board games like chess
and then I bought my first
computer when I was eight
with winnings from
a chess tournament.
Ever since then, I felt that
computers were this sort
of magical device that could
extend the power of your mind.
Virtual environments in games.
We think they're
the perfect platform
for developing and
testing AI algorithms.
Games are very convenient, in
that a lot of them have scores
so it's very easy to measure
incremental progress.
I'm gonna show you a videos
of the A-Jen system, the AI.
Let's start off with Break Out.
So here you control the bat
and ball and you're trying
to break through this
rainbow-colored wall.
The A-Jen system has to
learn everything for itself,
just from the raw pixels,
doesn't know what
it's controlling,
doesn't even know what
the object of the game is.
Now, the beginning,
after a hundred games,
you can see the A-Jen
is not very good.
It's missing the ball
most of the time,
but it's starting to
get the hang of the idea
that the bat should
go towards the ball.
Now, after 300 games,
it's about as good
as any human can play
this and pretty much
gets the ball back every time.
We thought, well,
that's pretty cool,
but we left the system
playing for another 200 games.
And it did this amazing thing.
It found the optimal
strategy was to dig a tunnel
around the side and put the ball
around the back of the wall.
The researchers working on
this are amazing AI developers,
but they're not so
good at Break Out
and they didn't know
about that strategy,
so they learned something
from their own system,
which is pretty funny and
quite instructive, I think,
about the potential
for general AI.
So, for us, what's
the next step now?
Go is the most complex game
pretty much ever devised by man.
Beating a professional
player at Go
is a longstanding, grand
challenge of AI research.
(bells tolling)
- Wow.
- Dear Mr Fan, my name
is Demis Hassabis.
I run an artificial
intelligence company
based in London called DeepMind.
As the strongest Go
player in Europe,
we would like to invite you
to our offices in London
both to meet you in person
and to share with you
an exciting Go project
that we're working on.
If you would be interested
in coming to visit us,
please let us know.
Many thanks, kind
regards, Demis.
- We needed to get
Fan Hui to DeepMind
to see we were a
serious operation
and we were serious people
doing proper research.
- And the search time is
getting better and better
as we go from, for
example, one to eight
and any one of these.
It always goes up.
- We think of DeepMind
as kind of like
an Apollo program effort for AI.
Our mission is to fundamentally
understand intelligence
and recreate it artificially.
And then, once we've done
that, we feel that we can use
that technology to help society
solve all sorts
of other problems.
- If you search
through the actual game
we can see kind of how
an algorithm thinks.
What's the most likely variation
that it thinks will happen.
- [Demis] We've been working
on AlphaGo and our program
to play Go for just
under two years now.
- All the little patterns
cascade together,
layer after layer after
layer after layer.
I started talking
about the game of Go
with Demis more
than 20 years ago.
And so, this has been
a really long journey.
The game of Go is the holy grail
of artificial intelligence.
For many years, people
have looked at this game
and they thought, wow,
this is just too hard.
Everything we've
ever tried in AI,
it just falls over when
you try the game of Go
and so that's why
it feels like a real
litmus test of progress.
If we can crack Go, we know
we've done something special.
- So, with Fan Hui, we
started talking around
what the real purpose
of the visit was.
It wasn't just a Go project
we wanted him to help with.
That actually we
wanted to play him
and we had a very
strong program.
- A lot of people have thought
that it was decades away.
Some people thought it would
be never because they felt
that to succeed at Go you
needed human intuition.
- Go is the world's oldest,
continuously played board game
and, in some sense, it
is one of the simplest
and also most abstract.
- There's only
one type of piece.
There's only one type of move.
You just place that
piece on the board
and then your goal is
to create a linked group
of your stones that surrounds
some empty territory.
And, when you surround enemy
stones, you capture them
and remove them from the board.
You earn points by
surrounding territory
and, at the end of
the game, the person
with the most territory wins.
It seems really simple, but
then you sit down to play
and you realize right
away, it's like, well,
I technically know
what I'm allowed to do,
but I have no clue
what I should do.
- Go's incredibly challenging
for computers to tackle
because compared, to say, chess,
the number of possible moves
in a position is much larger.
In chess it's about 20.
In Go it's about 200.
And the number of possible
configurations of the board
is more than the number
of atoms in the universe.
So, even if you took all
the computers in the world
and ran them for a million
years, that wouldn't be enough
compute power to calculate
all the possible variations.
If you ask a great Go
player why they played
a particular move, sometimes
they'll just tell you
it felt right.
So we have to come up with
some kind of clever algorithm
to mimic what people do
with their intuition.
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hello.
Nice meet you too.
- [Demis] So with Fan Hui, we
agreed a best of five match
and we agreed it
would be filmed.
You know, we would treat
it as a serious match.
- In that first match, I think
something clicked for him
that this wasn't an
ordinary Go program.
We weren't just doing the
same as everyone else,
that something
new was happening.
- After losing, losing, losing,
you can feel his pressure is
getting heavier and heavier.
And several times
after the game he said,
he wanted to go
out for fresh air.
I said, oh, I can go
with you and have a chat.
He said, no, I
want to go myself.
- I worried whether
he'd even come back.
You know, he seemed
very low and he spent
about an hour away
from the office.
He came back completely changed.
- Artificial intelligence
researchers have solved
the game of Go a decade
earlier than expected.
The computer named
AlphaGo was able
to beat the European
human champion.
- [Reporter] Artificial
intelligence researchers
have made a significant
breakthrough.
- It really is a
big leap forward.
There's a big difference
between the way the IBM computer
beat Kasparov, which
was programed by
expert chess players,
and the way the
Go-playing computer
more or less learned itself.
- The way we start off training
AlphaGo is by showing it
a 100,000 games that
strong amateurs have played
that we downloaded
from the internet.
And we first, initially,
get AlphaGo to mimic
the human player and
then, through self-playing
reinforcement learning, it
plays against different versions
of itself many millions of times
and learns from its errors.
- These specific ideas
that are driving AlphaGo
are gonna drive our future.
The technologies at
the heart of AlphaGo,
they're what are called
deep neural networks
which, essentially,
mimic the web
of neurons in the human brain.
It's a very old idea but,
recently, due to increases
in computing power, these
neural networks have become
extremely powerful,
almost overnight.
- Big neural networks
that operate on big data
can achieve surprising things.
AlphaGo found a way how
to learn how to play Go.
Learning is the key thing here.
It's machine learning.
- The whole beauty of
these types of algorithms
is that, because they're
learning for themselves,
they can go beyond what
we as the programmers
know how to do and allow us
to make new breakthroughs
in areas of science
and medicine.
So AlphaGo is one
significant step
towards that ultimate goal.
- The Go world were
skeptical about how strong
really was AlphaGo and how
much further did it need
to get to beat the
top professionals.
Our program is improving
over time and we want to push
the AI algorithm to the
limit and see how far
this kind of self-improving
process can go.
So we needed to look for
an even greater challenge.
- [Reporter] A match
like no other is about
to get underway in South Korea.
- [Reporter] Lee Sedol, the
long-reigning global champ.
- [Reporter] This
guy is a genius.
- [Reporter] He will take on
artificial intelligence program
AlphaGo, in the ultimate human
versus machine smack down.
- This is a huge moment
for both the world
of artificial intelligence
and, I think, the world of Go.
So far, AlphaGo has beaten
every challenge we've given it,
but we won't know its true
strength until we play
somebody who is at the top
of the world like Lee Sedol.
We chose Lee Sedol
because we wanted
a legendary, historic player.
Somebody who has
been acknowledged
as the greatest player
of the last decade.
- [Translator] I will
not be too arrogant,
but I don't think that it
will be a very close match.
The level of the player
that AlphaGo went against
in October is not
the same level as me.
So, given that a couple
of months was only passed,
I don't think that
it is enough for it
to be able to catch up with me.
My hope is that it will
be either five-zero for me
or maybe four to one.
So the critical point for me
is to make sure I
do not lose one.
(speaking in foreign language)
- We don't know how well
our system will play
against someone as
creative as Lee Sedol.
Also, he's very famous for
very creative fighting play
so this could be difficult
for us, but we'll see.
Maybe in some ways he's the most
difficult opponent
we could pick.
- There was still so much of a
question about whether or not
they could beat
someone like Lee Sedol.
Fan Hui is a good
player but he's nothing
like the very top players.
- Lee Sedol is a nine
dan professional.
Nine dan professional
is the highest rank
you can achieve in Go,
the ranking system.
Fan Hui, who's the
European champion,
is just a two dan professional.
On the other hand, at
the very top, Lee Sedol
is nine dan professional.
Lee Sedol is to Go what
Roger Federer is to tennis.
He's playing in Wimbledon
to win the Grand Slam
and it's not just this year.
He'll be there next year
and the year after that
and the year after that.
(children chattering)
- Go is taken
seriously in Korea.
It's so much part of the
culture like breathing
or, you know, like taking
swimming lessons or something.
- In ancient China,
Japan, Korea,
Go is one of the four noble
things for accomplishment
for literati with music,
poetry and painting.
So people think the Go players
are very smart and very noble.
- Mr Kwon started this
school so that he could
produce great player in Korea.
Lee Sedol, when he was age
of eight, he came in here
attending class nine a.m
until nine p.m. seven days.
And then he stay with Mr Kwon.
- Lee Sedol was a little
boy that I remember
when I was a
student studying Go.
He was very young
and rural enough
to think that pizza
grew on trees.
- Lee Sedol plays things
that are interesting
where you felt like he's
beyond winning and losing.
He wants to do something
that's innovative
or takes things
to the next level.
- So every Go player
study his game, for sure.
Roughly, 10 years, he dominates
the professional Go world.
He win 18 World Championships.
- Definitely, Lee Sedol is
gonna win the game, five all.
Yeah, all game.
He's gonna win all game.
- We had our evaluation
match last week.
We won a game and
we lost a game.
And we lost a game in a
way that would have made us
look extremely foolish if
that happened publicly.
It means that we
still have work to do
and we need to take
this really seriously.
It's just too much risk that
actually we could lose overall.
Not only that, but we
could lose in a way
that makes us look rather silly.
So I guess...
Yeah, Aja, did you
want to say anything
about what you're trying?
- Um, I'm working hard.
(group laughing)
- [Demis] So we're working
around the clock at the moment,
training our algorithms further,
trying to incrementally
keep on improving,
right up to the moment
where we have the match.
- We've collected
together people
with different skills
sets onto the same team.
So we have researchers,
engineers, valuation guys.
- [Man] We don't see it.
- Okay.
- [David] Aja is the
lead programmer and built
the original search engine.
- [Demis] So Aja's
responsibility is
quite a big one.
He'll be the one sitting
opposite Lee Sedol
and actually playing
the moves AlphaGo makes.
- I'm feeling excited.
Lee Sedol, he's a great player
and I feel honored
to play with him.
Many of my friends, they are
very excited about the match.
They keep telling me that
the whole world is watching.
Just prepare AlphaGo.
- Hello.
Hello, Demis, can you hear us?
- Yes, I can hear you guys.
Can you hear me okay?
- Yes, perfect.
I was curious to meet you,
such an amazing developer
who made AlphaGo.
It's very nice to meet you.
- Thank you, thank you.
So likewise.
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.
I love the game of Go.
I'm not very good, but I
don't know if you know,
but we actually have
something in common.
I actually also trained
at a game at a young age.
I used to be, when I was young,
a professional chess player.
(speaking in foreign language)
I used to play for
the England team
and then I stopped playing
when I was about 14.
When I was 13, I was
the second highest
rated player in the world.
- [Translator] After the
match, I would like to propose
that I give you one
teaching game of Go
and you give me one
teaching game of chess.
How does that sound?
- That sounds very good.
I would be very
honored to do that.
- I'm not sure it's okay
to ask you this question,
but I saw the games against
Fan Hui and I didn't think
it was quite at the
level to play with me.
But I heard that it's
getting really stronger.
Can I ask how much stronger?
(Demis laughing)
- Um, uh, I can't say
too much, of course,
but it's definitely got
significantly stronger.
- With more time, I
think a logical approach
would be to follow up
on Aja's local search.
Run that in AlphaGo,
generate a whole new data.
- [Man] Exactly.
- But we're just
out of time for that
so we have to be realistic.
- We realized that if
we wanted to prepare
for a mammoth task like
taking on Lee Sedol,
there would be nothing better
than talking to a professional
and we couldn't have picked
a better person that Fan Hui.
- [Aja] We invite
him as an advisor
because, during
the match, we found
he is a man of good spirit.
- [Woman] Welcome back.
- Thank you very much.
- It's very precious that
we have Fan Hui with us.
He was crushed by AlphaGo, but
then he became very positive
and a big help to us.
- The superheroes always have
a hidden vulnerability, right.
And the same is true of AlphaGo.
It's unbelievably
superhuman in general,
but it has some particular
weaknesses in some situations.
- We can think of
that being the space
of all the things
it knows about.
And it knows about most
of it extremely well,
but then there'll be these
tricky lumps of knowledge
that it just
understands very poorly
and it's really hard
for us to characterize
when it's going to enter
into one of these lumps.
But, if it does, it could
be completely delusional
thinking it's alive on
one part of the board
when, in fact, it's
dead or vice-versa.
So there is a real risk that
we could lose the match.
- [Woman] We've got version 18
in the pipeline, haven't we?
- Well, we'll only
go for version 18
if it makes a
significant improvement
which we're having to
rerun all the tests
cuz they went wrong
unfortunately.
So we're basically a day behind
in our evaluation
because of that.
Well, maybe we just
need to be realistic
that we've tried
a bunch of things
and we've come to the
point where we said
we would actually
start freezing the code
and saying, look, it's
actually not panning out.
These delusions are
still a realistic
possibility for the match.
- We have some weaknesses
that I don't think
we're going to fix
fully before the match
so that's causing a
little bit of anxiety.
(upbeat music)
- [Reporter] Lee Sedol is
getting ready to rumble.
On Wednesday live
across the internet,
this professional
South Korean Go player
will take on artificial
intelligence program AlphaGo.
- [David] Tomorrow,
Julian and George,
they pack up version 18,
they stick it on a laptop
and they fly out to Seoul.
(dramatic music)
- Is everything all set for
the victory against Lee Sedol?
- Everything is set, I think,
but when I get to the hotel,
I'm gonna catch
up with the team.
- What we should do in the
time remaining is list things
that could go wrong in the
solidity of the system.
- [Woman] Alright, rehearsal,
let's go, please folks.
- Yes, there is a terrace
and we will have security
so he'll be able to go up
there and be by himself.
- When I got here I didn't
expect the attention on the man.
It was literally
front page news.
About eight million
Koreans play the game of Go
and, even if you don't
recognize Lee Sedol,
he's a national figure.
And so there's that, right.
There's some national
pride involved,
but it's more than that.
Just the very thought of
a machine playing a human
at something like this,
I think is inherently
intriguing to people.
(crowd chattering)
(cameras clicking)
- [David] I just really
hope we win this first game.
If you lose the first
game, you literally
have to win three out of four
which is hard work.
- [Demis] Where you gonna be?
- I'll start in the match room
and then I'm gonna come in here,
make sure everything's sound.
- Yeah, you should
probably be in there.
- I know you're nervous.
- Yeah, I'm nervous.
I'm nervous.
How are you?
You're not nervous?
- A bit.
- A little bit, yeah?
It's good to have a
little bit of nerves.
It'll be fine.
Be fine, be fine.
- Hello and welcome to
the DeepMind challenge,
game one, round one, live
from the Four Seasons
here in Seoul, Korea.
I am Chris Garlock of the
American Go E-Journal.
I'm here with Michael Redman
nine dan professional.
Welcome, Michael.
Want to give a shout out to all
the folks watching
around the world.
- [Man] Well, the excitement
is pretty palpable
here in the hotel.
I've never seen a crush
of interested reporters
from around the world.
- [Announcer] All right, folks,
here you're gonna
see history made.
Stay with us.
- [Man] Five minutes, guys.
Five minutes.
- I just thought we should
take a moment together
and just think about
what's about to happen.
Extremely excited to be here.
Extremely proud of everyone
of you and what we've done
and, win or loss, I think it's
just amazing that we're here.
(cameras clicking)
(soft music)
(dramatic music)
- [David] We had worked
so hard to make sure
that this would go
technically smoothly.
We tested it and
tested it and tested it
and still, there comes that
moment, when you're live,
all the TV cameras are
broadcasting everything
and now it has to do the
thing you built it to do.
(cameras clicking)
(dramatic music)
- [Aja] I was a bit nervous.
It's the first time
that I sit in front
of a world class Go player.
And I actually can feel
the spirit and courtesy
of a great Go player
like Lee Sedol
because I think it
is the first time
he face a strange opponent.
I think it's not a
human, has no emotion.
It's cold, but he
stay very calm.
And I can feel his
mental strength.
(soft music)
- Oh!
- Oh.
- I'm Andrew Jackson.
With me here is Myungwan Kim,
a nine dan prof from the
Korean Baduk Association.
We are here live at
the Four Seasons Hotel
on the 21st floor.
What are we looking at?
How's the game going?
- From the very beginning?
- Yeah, yeah.
AlphaGo play very well, just
like a top professional.
- Just like a top professional?
- [Myungwan] Yeah,
it's very aggressive.
- Now, the fight is
getting really complicated.
This is actually the first
time I've seen AlphaGo
playing a game that has
this difficult a fight.
- [Michael] I just saw him
looking at his opponent's face
and that's just a
kind of a habit.
- [Chris] Just an instinct
as a player to look
at the person across
the board from you.
- [Michael] It's sort of like
something Lee Sedol would do
when he was wondering how
his opponent was feeling.
It's just a habit.
So, it's not as if Aja Huang
is gonna do any giveaway
cuz Aja Huang isn't
AlphaGo, right.
- Oo.
- Oh!
- [Man] Oo.
(soft music)
- It's hard to know where to be.
All the different
rooms are like exciting
in a different way.
Like nice to be here at
the heart of the operation.
- [Demis] Yeah,
I feel safe here.
- Yes, go for it.
- [Demis] It's done it.
It's gone in.
- Ooh, look at his
face, look at his face!
- That is not a confident face.
He's pretty horrified by that.
- I can't believe
what I see right now.
She thought, you know,
she's only a bit behind.
It's made a very
aggressive move here.
It make it very complicated.
I think Lee Sedol, if he
doesn't respond mentally,
then he can collapse.
- [Man] That's
the maximum number
of moves ahead that AlphaGo
is looking from the
current game position.
It's typically over 50.
It's often over 60.
- In the games we see often,
about move a hundred and fifty,
AlphaGo goes for the kill.
We're move a hundred
and fifteen now
so we're going to
that critical point.
- We are all astonished, just
in the middle of the game,
because AlphaGo seems to
be doing a much better job
than we all thought it would.
I thought that Lee
Sedol would be leading
the game confidently,
but it turned out
that he's struggling
at the moment.
But I think eventually
he will prevail, I hope.
I was more five to zero, but
now I'm not sure about that.
- Myungwan, it looks
like you've gotta count.
- Yeah, right.
- What do you think?
- White won a lot at this
time, if you check that.
- If it's like this,
white has won by a lot.
- Wow, it's so shocking.
I expected AlphaGo
to win only one game.
- Oh.
- [Aja] I can feel his pain.
He couldn't believe, you know.
He couldn't accept it.
It takes time for him
to accept the outcome.
- [Aja] I think he resigned
in a very polite way.
Lee Sedol, he's black,
but he put white stone.
- [Man] I think he resigned.
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah, time has stopped.
- Wow.
(upbeat music)
- [Woman] Congratulations.
- [David] I feel really good.
I feel like I really
believe in AlphaGo.
Of course, it's natural that
humans want humans to win.
I mean I think that's
a natural response.
But AlphaGo is human-created
and I think that's the ultimate
sign of human ingenuity
and cleverness.
Everything that AlphaGo
does, it does because a human
has either created the
data that it learns from,
created the learning algorithm
that learns from that data,
created the search algorithm,
all of these things
have come from humans.
So, really, this is
a human endeavor.
(cameras clicking)
- [Reporter] In the battle
between man versus machine,
a computer just
came out the victor.
- [Reporter] DeepMind put its
computer program to the test
against one of the brightest
minds in the world and won.
- [Reporter] AlphaGo beat
a professional player
who has 18 Go World
Championships under his belt.
The victory is
created a breakthrough
in artificial intelligence.
- [David] In research,
we normally work
to produce an academic paper.
It gets published and maybe
we get to talk about it
in a conference, if we're lucky.
This is not normal for research.
In fact, I've never
experienced any media attention
remotely close to this.
So it's a special
moment for us all
and we're just enjoying
it while it lasts.
- [Reporter] In a
match up between man
and machine, who wins?
Well, so far, it's the machine.
In Seoul, South Korea,
the artificially
intelligent computer
defeated the global
champion in the ancient
Chinese board game Go.
Lee Sedol lost the
first match up,
but he's got four more chances.
- It is a bit strange
being on the front cover
and everything as a
computer scientist.
Nobody used to learn codes.
Nobody really knows about it.
- Perhaps heard the
joke, how can you tell
that a computer
scientist is an extrovert
and not an introvert?
If he's an extrovert,
he looks at your shoes
when he's talking to you
instead of at his own.
- [Julian] Like if you
look at Aja, he avoids
all the cameras like crazy.
He's like, the game is finished,
and he's like, I'll
go back in his room.
And I think a lot of computer
scientists would be like that.
We're more about doing our work
than standing in the spotlight.
- [Announcer] Hello and
welcome to game two,
round two in the Google
DeepMind challenge throw down
between man and machine.
Game one, the machine
takes down a man.
Huge shock.
Headlines around the world.
- [Man] The reactions
on the ground here
from the folks in Korea
were just stunned.
They estimate 60 million people
watched the game in China alone.
It's probably bringing up
to maybe 80 million people
watched this game worldwide.
It was just incredible
and, if anything,
today is probably even
more of a madhouse.
So Lee Sedol knows today,
he knows that this is just
a really important game, right.
He's gotta win.
- [Michael] Lee Sedol on white.
I think probably looking
for a little payback.
- [Chris] My impression
is that maybe
he underestimated AlphaGo and
he's gonna change his tactics.
- Yeah.
- He's playing at half
his speed actually.
- [Michael] Well, if I
say anything about AlphaGo
that is not normal, is maybe
the way it handles a game
when it thinks its ahead.
- We're actually
gonna have a visit
from one of the team and
we'll talk about exactly
that point from the inside.
Thanks so much for coming by.
I really appreciate it.
Can you sort of share a bit of
what is going on in AlphaGo.
- So AlphaGo has these
three main components.
There's the Policy
Network which was trained
on high level games to
imitate those players.
And then we have a
second component,
we call this the value
Net and it can evaluate
the board position and say
what is the probability
of winning in this
particular position.
And the third component
is the Tree Search
where it would look through
different variations of the game
and try to figure out what
will happen in the future.
So, if we now take a
position like this,
first the Policy Network
will scan the position
and come up with what would be
the interesting spots to play
and it builds up a
tree of variations.
And then employs this Value
Net that tells it how promising
is the outcome of this
particular variation.
So AlphaGo tries to maximize
its probability of winning,
but it doesn't care at
all about the margin
by which it wins.
- Okay, so when you
see a slow-looking move
that's maybe an
indication that AlphaGo
thinks it has a
good chance to win.
- Yeah, that is a
little giveaway.
- A little tell, we're
looking for a tell.
- [Man] Oh, looks
like Lee is taking
a little bit of a break.
(soft music)
(speaking in foreign language)
- The value, uh...
- That's a very surprising move.
- [Chris] I thought
it was a mistake.
- So coming on top of a fourth
line zone is really unusual.
- [Chris] Yeah, that's
an exciting move.
I think we're seeing
an original move here.
That's the kind of move
that you play Go for.
- [Man] Hey.
Interesting stuff.
- This fifth line
shoulder hit is uh...
- [Michael] I wasn't
expecting that.
I don't really
know if it's a good
or bad move at this point.
- [David] The professional
commentators almost unanimously
said that not a
single human player
would have chosen move 37.
So I actually had a
poke around in AlphaGo
to see what AlphaGo thought.
And AlphaGo actually agreed
with that assessment.
AlphaGo said it was a
one in 10,000 probability
that move 37 would have been
played by a human player.
So it knew that this was
an extremely unlikely move.
It went beyond its human
guide and it came up
with something new and
creative and different.
- I am very much
watching the game
through these commentators.
That's the way it works
so when they're confused
I'm certainly confused.
At the same time, I'm
latching onto the fact
that they are confused, right.
That is an interesting moment.
When everyone else is confused,
who's not confused
beside the machine?
- [Chris] He's
back, Lee is back.
(dramatic music)
- Go is like geopolitics.
Like something small
that happens here
can have a ripple effect
hours down the road
in a different
part of the board.
The game kind of turned on
its axis at that moment.
- [Michael] This is a
tough game for Lee Sedol.
AlphaGo is just not letting
Lee Sedol do what he wants.
- Black has almost 60 points.
That's a lot.
- [Andrew] That's
not a good sign.
Lee Sedol just slapped himself
on the side of the head.
- [Myungwan] Oh wow.
- I think black's
ahead at this point.
- It's looking good, ain't it?
We're on that steady path now.
(soft music)
- Oh, he resigned.
It looks like Lee Sedol
has just resigned.
- There was this heavy
sadness over that whole floor.
You could feel it
during the game.
I felt it during the game.
And on leaving the
commentary room to go
to the press conference and
I was stopped by someone,
another technology reporter.
At first, all he wanted to
talk about was the technology
and how great this was.
But then even he kind of
slipped into this moment
of melancholy where
he was upset as well.
- I am quite speechless.
I admit that it was a very
clear loss on my part.
From the very
beginning of the game,
there was not a moment
in time that I felt
that I was leading the game.
- You feel elated and you
feel a little bit scared.
There is something, I
think, frightening to people
about a machine that
learns on its own.
- For us, AlphaGo was obviously
just some computer program,
but looking at the
commentary on the internet,
I already saw the
commentators call AlphaGo
like he and she during the
games, completely unconsciously.
AlphaGo is really a very,
very simple program.
It's not anywhere close
to full AI and we already
see that happening so I
found that very interesting.
- The tendency to
anthropomorphize AI systems
is one of the big obstacles
in the way of actually trying
to understand how AI might
impact the world in the future.
For example, the conversation
is about what could go wrong,
like what the risks
are and invariably
you see this Terminator picture.
Every single time, there are
these red, glowing eyes, right?
- We're really closer to a smart
washing machine than Terminator.
If you look at today's AI,
we are really very nascent.
I'm extremely excited and
passionate about AI's potential,
but AI is still very
limited in its power.
- I think that people
are right to think
that there is a danger that,
as we continue to improve
these systems that we might
misstep that threshold
where we do cross
over into danger.
But the good news is
there are already people
thinking about those dangers.
- You know, there's
a lot of talk now
and we're leading the
discussion on this,
that maybe there should be
a kind of cross industry,
best practices working
group or something
where the leaders of
the research teams
in those organizations,
you know, the big ones
that are working on AI, IBM,
Microsoft, so on, come together
and make sure that AI is used
ethically and responsibly.
- I think what is important is
that there is this community
of people who are leading
the cutting edge of AI,
who are interacting
with academics and
already are thinking
about the longterm
and how we can ensure
that innovation is
responsible as the power
of these machines
gets even greater.
- This is it, folks.
Day three, game three.
Lee Sedol, Go master,
back to the wall.
He's down two-zero.
He's got to win today
to keep hope alive.
- I heard that four
pros went to visit him
to console him into
a review after--
- Console him?
You think he's upset?
- I mean Lee Sedol is upset.
Yeah.
- In the beginning, there
was a forceful fight.
And AlphaGo play very well so
he secure a very early lead.
From (mumbles) the window
was very high already.
It was climbing towards
a hundred percent.
- It's looking good for us.
That black ruby is huge
and it's got nowhere to go
and it's gonna be
running around.
(soft music)
- [Commentator] I don't know
how to describe this situation.
If I were black, I will resign.
He should admit that we
are facing the strongest
existence ever in Go history.
- There's no point in
playing out the end game
when you're gonna lose, right.
- [Chris] Even if black can
live there, oh, he resigned.
- [Michael] It's
done, it's done.
- Okay.
- Wow.
Wow.
You saw history
made here tonight.
- [Chris] AlphaGo has won
again, three straight wins.
- [Michael] Three straight
wins has won the match.
- [Demis] You know, certainly,
I feel a bit ambivalent
about it given
I'm a games player
and Go is the pinnacle
of board games.
But I really like the statement
one of the top Chinese
professionals said,
if AlphaGo wins, maybe
we'll really start
to get to see what
this game is about.
- [Maddy] I couldn't celebrate.
It was fantastic
that we had won,
but there was such a big
part of me that saw this man
trying so hard and
being so disappointed.
(dramatic music)
- [Cade] You can see
that he was more relaxed
after he had lost
three games in a row.
That said, the stakes
were still high.
You know, in the end,
it isn't about pride.
- [Chris] Can Lee Sedol
find AlphaGo's weakness?
Is there, in fact, a weakness?
- I was thinking I'd
just pull the plug.
- You'd just pull the plug?
- Yeah.
- Everyone's still
cheering for Lee Sedol
and, yeah, it's not
going very well.
- It feels pretty good
for black at this point.
- It feels pretty
good for black, yes.
- [Michael] It's
developing into a very,
very dangerous fight.
This is really Lee
Sedol's type of game.
He likes this kind of fight.
White has to find something
inside black's territory.
- [Commentator] I think
he is already planning
on trying something.
- Yes, yes.
- There is a little
potential there.
And I think maybe he's
gonna try to do something.
- [Andrew] Lee Sedol magic.
- Lee Sedol, he's
running short on time,
but he's gonna have to
use up all his time.
- [Commentator] He just burned
like seven or eight minutes
just on this move already.
- We can't find anything.
- [Chris] What is
Lee Sedol up to here?
- [Michael Yeah, he's
really concentrating.
- [Chris] He really
is, look at that.
- [Chris] This is the
hinge of the game.
- Oh, look at that move.
That's an exciting move.
- Look.
- Oh, he found the wedge.
- [Chris] Whoa.
- [CMichael] It's gonna
change the equation
because now black cannot escape.
- That would be so
cool if that works.
- Ooh!
- [Commentator]
AlphaGo has just played
something maybe unusual.
- [Michael] You know,
I'm not actually sure
what AlphaGo is
trying to do here.
- [Chris] What's that about?
- [Michael] I don't
really understand it.
- Well, well.
- This could be that it actually
can't find a way through.
I think this is it's looked
far enough ahead to see
that it doesn't work and
now maybe it's on tilt?
I don't know.
- There it comes.
- It's like it's
fallen off a cliff.
Yeah, it's made a mistake.
- Did anything strange
happen in the...
- [Man] No, it
all looked normal.
- Well, we can definitely
say, well, there's a weakness.
Well, we definitely
say it's a mistake.
- [David] I felt this
mixture of a sinking feeling
in my stomach where I
was wondering if AlphaGo
is becoming delusional in this
situation where I could see
that it was starting
to play strangely.
And, at the same time,
relief that Lee Sedol,
that he was actually
in with a chance now.
- I knew after move 78,
after like 10 or 20 moves,
I saw AlphaGo strange moves.
I know AlphaGo
somehow became crazy,
but I didn't realize why.
- Whoa!
We slipped from 95 ahead.
- At the point, where
we made the mistake?
I think that
something went wrong.
That's the longest we've
searched this entire game.
I think it's searched so
deeply it's confused itself.
- [Michael] I do get the
impression that AlphaGo
is sort of gone
off on a tangent.
- What are you doing now?
- Maybe it has a master plan?
- No, it doesn't even
think it has, does it?
So it knows it's made a mistake.
It starts evaluating
it the other way.
Look, look, Lee's so confused.
He's like what is it doing?
That's not a I'm
scared confused.
That's a what is it doing?
- You know, you asked
if it was a bug.
I've said before that if
DeepMind has figured out
how to write code
that doesn't have bugs
that is a bigger news
story that AlphaGo.
- Oh, you're kidding me.
This next move we're gonna play,
I think they're gonna laugh.
Everybody's gonna laugh.
- [Commentator] Oh, oh, oh!
- [Man] I don't really know
what AlphaGo is
trying to do here.
- That's the
understatement of the year.
- [Andrew] No, no,
that's the move.
Aja Huang makes no misclicks.
Lee Sedol is very confused.
These are not human moves.
- This move, also,
sort of inexplicable.
- [Chris] I mean you can
clearly call those the saves.
- [Michael] Yes, of course.
- But it's the first
time in the four matches
that we've seen moves like that.
- Oh, the value
dropped even more.
- That's weird.
- [Andrew] Come on, Lee Sedol.
- This unbelievable.
- Alright!
- I was so confident
that this black mire
would just be
consolidated by black
and there's nothing there.
And, somehow, he's just
erased it all, like it's gone.
- So he's found his weakness?
That wedge move
probably surprised it.
- AlphaGo seemed to
have such a good game
and then this whole
sequence in the center
sort of changed that.
- He pulls off a miracle.
He managed to make
it so complicated
that the artificial intelligence
doesn't evaluate it.
I think it looks like Aja
Huang maybe sitting there
also knows that
the game is over.
- [Andrew] No, I haven't
seen him smile yet.
- [Andrew] He's so serious.
He wants to be careful.
(dramatic music)
- [Man] There you
go, AlphaGo resigned.
- Looks like AlphaGo
has resigned.
- [Chris] Wow.
- The most amazing game,
I'm almost gonna tear up,
was game four where he
comes back and wins.
(crowd cheering)
- I heard from so many people
saying they were running
out in the street.
They were so happy.
They were chanting,
they were celebrating.
- Especially after a
zero-three down, at the time,
seems to be hopeless that the
end of the world is coming,
but we see the light.
- Usually, I'm happy when I
win not like my colleague wins.
But this time it
felt like my win.
(upbeat music)
(crowd clapping)
- My question is
about number 78 move,
Chinese top Go player
(mumbles) it was a brave play,
what were you thinking
when you made that play?
Thank you.
- [Demis] It does leave
me a little bit in awe
of the human brain's
power, in particular,
Lee's amazing ability to
cause AlphaGo problems
and find something
seemingly out of nothing.
And so we really want to
understand what had happened.
(upbeat music)
- [Announcer] Welcome
back to the Four Seasons.
World champion, Lee
Sedol, went looking
for AlphaGo's weakness in
game four and he found it.
Today, last round,
he's looking to see
if he can repeat that.
We'll see what happens.
- [Commentator] The place
is a madhouse downstairs.
There may be as many, if nor
more, journalists here today
than there were for game one.
- [Maddy] We were really
excited for the fifth match
to see what would happen.
Was this going to
be a three-two thing
or was it going to
be a four-one thing?
And, you know, there's
a different message
with both of those.
- You weren't crazy about
the timing on this move.
- No, yeah.
- And now, you don't
approve of this?
- Yeah, I'm sort of
thinking that maybe AlphaGo
hasn't recovered
from game four yet.
- Oh no, I hope it doesn't...
Oh no, it needs to play the...
- [Chris] Are we seeing
another short circuit
or is there
something, what's a--
- [Commentator] I think it
could be a kind of a misreading.
- [Michael] And were
you pretty comfortable
with saying that--
- [Chris] That it's
looking good for Lee Sedol?
- [Michael] Good for Lee Sedol.
- Why is it playing
in there for?
- There's no reason for white
to be playing that move.
It's a bad move
and, in some cases,
it's going to lose a point too.
- The whole game we
thought AlphaGo was wrong
about the board position
and we were super worried
that it's gonna play garbage.
It's going to be like losing
in a very embarrassing way.
And this continued
for the whole game.
- Well, that we don't know,
but we're not good enough
Go players to know that, right?
- Yeah.
As it turned out, none
of us know Go well enough
to accurately judge
what AlphaGo is doing.
- This one looks like
white is winning.
Aah!
- We all say some of
AlphaGo's moves are so weird
and strange and maybe mistakes.
But, after a game is finished,
we have to doubt
ourselves, our judgment.
- AlphaGo making another
kind of nonsensical throw in.
We're not really sure
what that's about.
- This is what 10 or maybe
11 dan play looks like.
It looks weird and we
don't quite understand it.
- I think it is
important to study more
about AlphaGo's
mistake-like moves.
And maybe we can adjust
our knowledge of AlphaGo.
- To me the most amazing
thing to come out
of my understanding of Go,
as a result of watching
AlphaGo play, are the
infamous slack moves.
- Well, there's something
strange about the way
it's playing because
it's playing some moves
that are not really necessary.
- Right.
- A slack move is a
move that looks lazy.
You can see these
other better moves
and AlphaGo is rejecting them.
But what I think
AlphaGo is teaching us
is that we've been
using score as a proxy
for chance of winning.
So the bigger my
margin of territory,
the more confident I
am that I'm gonna win.
And AlphaGo is
saying no, no, no.
It shouldn't matter
how much you win by.
You only need to win
by a single point.
Why should I be seizing
all this extra territory
when I don't need it.
The lessons that
AlphaGo is teaching us
are going to influence
how Go is played
for the next thousand years.
- By how much are we talking?
Two points?
- One and a half.
- One and a half points.
- Of course, Go is just a game.
But we could learn
important lessons
from a computer being
so successful at Go.
Machines will have
the capability,
not only to crunch through
huge amount of data,
but also to analyze
it intelligently.
Just as in the case
of the Go games,
the machine made moves that
surprised even experts.
And, eventually, the machines
will gain our confidence
because we will see
that very, very often
they make a better guess than
we could have made as humans.
- Unfortunately for Lee
Sedol, I think white
might have a slight
advantage here.
- Who told us that?
- Someone, I don't know.
- Winning, okay, not won.
- That's what she said.
- No, not really.
- We don't know the score.
We have no idea what's
going on, right.
(crowd clapping)
- I think it just really is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
I would say it's the most
amazing thing I've experienced.
You know, for us, it's the
culmination of a 20-year dream.
- It started as a pure
research endeavor.
We just wanted to understand
can neural networks
play the game of Go?
And, from there, it went on
to a level that
I never expected.
And I'm unbelievably
proud of the team.
- When I started doing
artificial intelligence,
it was four or five years ago
and I was really
interested in that.
But many people
would discourage me.
They would say
there is no future.
So actually seeing
that within five years
we are at this stage right
now it's amazing by itself.
- Everybody say, (speaking
in foreign language)
- There are so many
possible application domains
where creativity in a different
dimension to what humans
could do could be
immensely valuable to us.
And I'd just love to have
more of those moments
where we look back
and say, yeah,
that was just like move 37.
Something beautiful
occurred there.
- At least in a broad
sense, move 37 begat move 78
begat a new attitude
in Lee Sedol,
a new way of seeing the game.
He improved through
this machine.
His humanness was
expanded after playing
this inanimate creation.
And the hope is that that
machine, in particular,
the technology behind it,
can have the same effect
with all of us.
- I remember hearing
a talk by Kasparov
who says that a good
human plus a machine
is the best combination.
