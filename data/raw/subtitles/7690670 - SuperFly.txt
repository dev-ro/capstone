Oh, what's up, boy?
Oh, headshot. Nah.
- Right there, right there.
- Priest. Mmm.
That's Priest, man.
What's up, Priest?
Interior
and everything, see?
Yo, Litty.
Yo, Litty!
You hear that?
That's my new shit.
Go ahead and soak it up.
- Do the thing. Yeah.
- What's up, black?
Y'all good?
I need to get at you
for a second, man.
Oh, you need
to get at me?
That's cute. Yeah,
that's what I said.
Well, anything you
got to say to me,
you can say it
in front of my folks.
You sure that's
what you want?
Most definitely.
I want my money.
Well, you got
a real funny way of asking.
Wasn't no question.
What's that mean to you,
on your chest?
What's
that mean to me?
That means God is great
'cause he continues
to forgive me,
even though I'm the
biggest sinner there is.
I don't believe that.
You still going to church
every Sunday, ain't you?
You used to be
over at New Birth,
but now you're
at World Changers, huh?
And your Aunt Cici
plays keys there.
Going on six years
now, wow.
Hmm. I wonder what
she'd think about you
having a four-five
by your waist.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Also, word of advice. If you're
wearing an ankle monitor,
you might not want
to carry a gun
unless you want to do
another 10 years.
That what you want?
Huh?
And I don't know what
your fake-fur-coat-wearing ass
ain't doing at home.
Now, your girl's
due any day now.
Side chick about
to have a baby, too,
if I'm not mistaken.
Suggestion. Maybe when
you're at the hospital,
you can put 'em both
in the same room.
Spare you the
back-and-fucking-forth.
Look at me when I'm
talking to you, Litty.
God is great.
God is powerful, yeah.
But even more so,
God is all-knowing.
And that is what
makes him scary as shit.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
So I'mma ask you
one more time.
Where's my motherfucking
money, Litty?
I ain't playing with you.
Where's my money?
Look, Priest,
you know I got you.
You ain't got shit.
Literally.
You're three months behind
on your mortgage payments,
and I don't care how many
gangsters from Joyland
you got with you. Ain't nobody
more gangster than a bank.
Come on, Litty,
you're going broke.
You and I both
know that, right?
I mean, the diamonds
around your neck,
- they're not even real.
- Come on, don't do that.
Look, let me work it off.
Look, you give me some
bricks, I can move 'em.
You're being serious?
You ain't sold shit since you
was trappin' at that car wash
on G-Road.
And you weren't
even good at that.
You are a rapper.
Stay rapping.
Go back out on the road,
get them commas up,
bring me back that check.
In the meantime,
I'mma take them keys.
- My keys?
- My keys.
Come on, now.
I'll send somebody by
to pick it up.
Yo, Priest. Priest.
I been working
these streets since I was 11.
I been hustlin'
every day since.
I gave people jobs
when there were no jobs.
And I moved my operation
from my living room
to an old garage.
Now, I got operations
all over the city.
Isn't that what the
American dream is all about?
Welcome to Masq,
the livest strip club in ATL.
Y'all want to see some ass?
Well, we want to see
some motherfucking cash.
Now let's turn this shit
all the way up.
Hey, yo. Yo, yo.
What the fuck is wrong?
Give me the phone.
Hand that shit over.
No fucking pictures.
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the fucking phone!
- I'm not playing with you!
- I didn't know.
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the phone.
I don't give a fuck about none
of that. Give me the phone.
Chill, chill, chill.
You trippin', bruh.
Calm down.
This shit we doing
belongs on camera, bruh.
You know what I'm saying?
This TMZ shit.
It's Sno Patrol!
We run these
motherfucking streets.
We run these
motherfucking streets.
Sno Patrol!
Get out of here, man.
Mmm. Hola, mami,
despacito, despacito.
What's happening?
Mmm. I don't speak
none of that.
How about a dance?
Aw, baby,
I'm not a dancer.
But you're so cute,
I wish I was.
I have to get
back to work.
Hey. You good?
I don't like you
with those guys.
I don't need
a babysitter, mi amore.
What you need is a bodyguard
when those mother...
Or some tequila.
What up, baby?
Hey, baby, I didn't know
you were coming.
I told him to come.
Hi, honey.
- She said it was poppin'.
- Oh, it is.
- Yeah?
- I need a re-up.
Ooh. Cheers to that.
Hold on, y'all.
I'll be right back.
She's always
working, huh?
Listen, she shouldn't
have to do this anymore.
Too much shit goes on around
here that I need to be up on.
She knows how to pull that
better than anybody.
And, besides, she can
take care of herself.
- Hey.
- I know she can.
I just don't like it.
I don't give a fuck
how many yards this dude
ran for in his career.
He don't run shit here.
If there ain't a bottle
in his hand
in the next five minutes,
you need to get your
ass on out of here.
I got it.
How did it go with Litty?
You get our money?
Even better.
I took his pride.
How is that better?
If you can hang something
over someone's head,
they will always go
wherever you lead them.
Litty'll do whatever the
fuck I want him to do,
which is better than money.
Yo, what it do?
All drinks on Sno Patrol!
- I see winter's come tonight.
- Yeah.
I swear, the more money
this fucking Sno Patrol makes,
the sloppier they get.
It's a goddamn disgrace.
- Yo, Priest, what up?
- What up?
Come fuck with me!
Come have a shot!
I'll make sure
I tell Q you said that.
Please do.
That boy Priest
in the building, man.
Q, what's up, baby?
What up, fool?
How you feeling?
- How you been?
- I'm blessed, man. How you been?
You know y'all looking like a
big bowl of rice up here now.
Yeah, but you getting
your Sammy Davis Jr. on.
- Hide all the white girls!
- Come on now,
you know you wish
you had my hair.
You just can't grow it no more.
Hey, get my man
a drink of something.
You know, speaking
of the white girls, man,
y'all got the numbers in
the streets fucked up, man.
Yes, sir.
Niggas can't eat, man.
What's up with that?
You know, man, I'm just trying
to keep my head above water,
stay out the wave.
Nah, you definitely
doing that, no?
- Yes, sir.
- Blessings to you, man.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to that.
- I'll see you later on.
- You be safe, fool.
I don't know why you let that
nigga Priest still breathe.
What you mean, bro?
Man, listen, Priest ain't
never done shit to us, bruh.
I'm saying there's enough money
out here for everybody to eat.
Fuck that. I'm hungry.
I'm gonna take his food.
Man, all these
bitches in here,
all this money we get,
and you talking about Priest.
We on top of the world.
It's Sno Patrol, baby.
Mmm-hmm.
Fuck.
Hey, yo, Dee.
What's going on, boss?
Juju's been drinking a little
too much tonight, man.
Need you
to look over him.
- All right.
- Let's get it.
Juju.
- What, you had one too many?
- I'm straight.
All right, look, I'm in the
cut if you need me, a'ight?
A'ight.
- You good?
- Yeah.
Hi. Thank you.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- What?
They're cute.
You remember when
we used to be just like that?
Acting a fool
after the club.
Everybody had to pitch in
to buy the same one bottle,
going through a whole bunch of
club soda just to make it last.
And I always said
I'd take care of you.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Come on.
All right.
You and Cynthia better
wait up for me now.
All right.
- I'll see you at the house.
- Okay, baby.
Fuck out of here with your
skinny-jean-wearing ass.
Yeah, walk, pussy.
I'm not walking
away for my sake.
I'm walking away for yours.
What you say?
Think them two bitches,
you got it going down?
Your hos ain't shit.
You ain't shit.
Fuck
out of here, man.
Nigga, I said go.
Oh, my God, look!
They're fighting, y'all.
Oh, my God!
What the fuck are you doing?
Man, come on!
Keep it covered. Keep it covered.
Look, listen to me.
You call an ambulance.
You take her to Grady.
They're gonna try and take
her to another hospital,
but you make sure she goes
to Grady. Do you understand?
It's the best trauma
center in Atlanta.
Okay, here.
Don't worry.
What? Come back.
All the power in the
world never stopped a bullet.
And no car can outrun fate.
I worked so hard
for what I got,
and it could
all be taken away
for the stupidest shit
you could think of.
And this ain't the first
time I've been shot at, but...
It's got to be the last.
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.
What up, boy?
- Yo, what up, man?
- Hey, Priest.
How you doing,
Monique? You all right?
Yeah. Get up, baby.
You know I've
been calling y'all.
Yeah, no cell phones, man.
Sorry about that shit.
Hey, now that you're here, let
me get at you about something.
- Okay. Later.
- A'ight.
Yo, Priest.
You got my word, Freddie.
- A'ight?
- A'ight.
- Where's Eddie?
- He's over there.
Shake 'em up,
shake 'em up, shake 'em.
Come on, I'm telling you,
it's gonna keep happening.
Come on, come on, come on.
Put your money down, baby.
Put your money down.
Hold it, hold it.
Bet, bet. Put your money down, baby.
Come on.
Let's play for
some real money, baby.
What's wrong? You ain't
got your weight up?
Nigga, my money longer than
Peachtree, you dig? Mmm-hmm.
Well, ain't no reason for
you to wait on the weight.
That's a swift eight ounces
of coke right there, baby.
Let's do it. Let's do it!
Put your money up.
This ain't just luck, brother.
I'm telling you.
This must be from God, baby.
Don't mind if I do.
For good luck.
Motherfucker!
- God damn, man!
- Lucky leprechaun motherfucker.
Beautiful.
I appreciate you.
What y'all waiting on? Throw
it in the pot like gumbo.
Pay the man.
- Eddie.
- Yup.
We need to talk.
- Right now?
- Yeah, now would be nice.
Like, I'm winning
this shit while these...
All right.
A'ight, y'all, look.
All right, y'all will get y'all
shot at the king next week.
But until then, if you would,
cash my chips out, thank you.
Hold up,
hold up, hold up.
Where the hell your pretty
ass think you taking him?
It ain't none of your damn
business where I'm taking him.
The hell it ain't
my business, bruh.
You ain't gonna just walk your
man out of here like that
and not give me a chance
to win back my money, nigga.
Perm-fade-wearing
motherfucker!
Watch your motherfucking mouth, nigga.
- Oh, hell no!
- Take it easy, take it easy.
Just keep it cool.
The game ain't the only thing
that got to end tonight.
- You see what I'm saying?
- Be cool.
- You got it, kinfolk.
- Yeah, I know I got it.
Let's go.
Hey, cash my
chips out, too.
I don't know
how many times
I got to tell you this, man.
Fuck the Sno Patrol!
Seriously, man.
A bunch of grown-ass men
who dressing like they
deserve to all be shot.
I'm not going to war
with Sno Patrol.
But Juju don't get
a fucking pass.
- So how you wanna do it?
- We're not doing anything.
It doesn't matter
how smart you are
in a world of stupid
motherfuckers
that'll shoot at you
over some petty shit.
What are
you talking about?
Listen
to what I'm saying.
We have been operating without
the police knowing about us,
feds knowing about us,
under the radar.
All of that shit's
about to change.
A fucking girl
was shot last night, Eddie.
It's a miracle
she survived.
The city's gonna
be all over it.
Sno Patrol's about
to clap back at us.
Think about it, now.
Everybody who's been at
the top of the game been got.
Right? They end up dead
or in jail almost always
because of their ego, wanting
more than they should want.
Everybody wants
to be great, nigga.
Everybody wants to be superfly.
They want to be us.
But it's fucking
time, nigga.
You dance with
the devil long enough...
He's bound
to step on your feet.
You sound like
that fucking bullet hit you
in your fucking head.
All right, look,
all our years,
we never had to body anyone,
Eddie. Why is that?
Because when they think
you gonna do it,
you don't have to.
It's leverage.
No, it's 'cause bodies
leave a stink on you.
Not talking about a stink
that bring no police.
I'm talking about a stink
that you can never shake.
A stink that will
bring you down.
I get it, Priest.
You don't have
to fucking preach to me, okay?
It's not Sunday.
If you get it, then you
hear what I'm saying.
I want out
the cocaine business.
You just emotional.
I get it.
You almost got got.
But the game has
been good to us.
- Man, we ain't leaving nothing.
- Not yet.
A'ight.
One last deal.
One last score so big
that we will never have
to look over our shoulder again.
Not for no cop,
not for no crook,
not for nobody.
Man, how long you been
thinking about this shit?
'Cause you don't just
think about ideas.
Look, I've always had
an exit plan, Eddie. Always.
We have got
to do this shit
before I fucking
kill somebody, Eddie,
or a motherfucker
kills me.
I'mma talk to Scatter.
I'mma have him
turn the faucet on blast.
And I'll ask him
to up our supply.
What?
You know, that sound
like a fucking joke.
We got a better chance
robbing a fucking bank.
He will do it for me.
We got real history.
So, are you in?
Priest, you're
my fucking brother.
Tell me that you're in.
I got you.
Weight on the shoulder,
hips down.
A'ight. That's it
for today, class.
Scatter, school's
getting bigger.
Lot of students.
It's a real legitimate
business, wow.
It's not just
a front anymore.
Just like that art gallery
you bought your girl.
Not even a year later,
and you rubbing elbows
with Atlanta's upper echelon,
hanging out with
the penthouse crew.
That's a smart move for you.
Smart move for both
of us. Come on, now.
It's not easy
being a dope dealer
without looking like one.
Glove up.
Nah, I'm not trying to do all
that. I came down here...
When do you come to my
gym and not glove up?
I know you miss your favorite student.
Just say it.
Yeah, I miss
kicking your ass.
Now you about to get it.
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.
I want to talk to you
about something.
So talk.
I want to up our supply.
- For what?
- There's more to be had.
We good with
what we got. So why?
I understand the way
we've been doing things.
All right, I do,
but we're missing
a lot of opportunity
on the street.
You know what I'm saying?
We're just leaving
money on the table.
What color belt
am I in jiu-jitsu?
- Black.
- That's right.
You ain't never see me
wear no belt, do you?
And if it is, it's brown.
You want to know why?
'Cause people respect me,
but they leave me be.
They see black,
and motherfuckers
start asking questions.
They might even be
fool enough to test me.
We leave money on the table
so we don't get caught.
But if you see an opportunity,
you got to take it.
Sometimes the opportunity
ain't what it looks like.
You ever hear that saying,
"If it's too good to be true,
it probably is"?
Maybe we're just that good.
You ain't that good.
And the answer's no.
I'm not upping
your supply.
I don't get it, Q.
You owe me $50,000.
I had to pay
that girl you shot,
her and her friends,
to keep they mouth shut.
You know if I would've
knew that shit,
I would've paid
them hos a visit.
A visit?
- Nah, the cash work every time.
- Let me guess.
You want to pay this nigga
Priest in gold, right?
Priest? You still
on that shit?
- I told you to drop that.
- What the fuck would you do
- if a nigga put his hands on you, Q?
- The fuck you mean?
I would've whacked that bitch!
But that's me, not you!
You need to let that shit go.
You fucking up my money.
Damn!
Fuck y'all
talking about, man?
Man, Dee talking about
how he could whup Mike Tyson.
Man, give the man
the whole story.
I ain't talking
about Iron Mike.
I'm talking about right now,
Old-and-Fat Mike.
Bro, you could probably whup
his ass, too. Why you playing?
Not even with a baseball bat.
Nah, my nigga.
Nah, nah.
I don't know about that, bro.
Mike's still Mike.
He put them hands on you,
it's over with.
Bro, have you seen me
in a gym lately?
Yeah, nigga,
that's the problem.
Let me show you this combo
I've been working on.
It's for you, too. Bro,
you know what I'm saying?
I don't do
all that kung fu shit.
I'm a real man,
you feel me? I...
Oh, shit!
- Get these motherfuckers, man!
- Get them bitches!
Whoo!
Let's go. Let's get
the fuck out of here.
He'd been driving
10 hours straight.
Who the fuck does that?
Is this nigga ever gonna stop?
Don't get too close, now.
Stay, like, a few cars back.
Why are we
doing this?
How do you even know Scatter's
going to meet his supplier?
I just know shit.
How 'bout that?
I would never
go around you, Priest.
You think Scatter's
gonna be okay with you
going around him
to get to his connect?
He's
never gonna know.
Man, I need to sleep.
I need to sleep,
but you keep yelling.
Could you just shut up,
please, and keep driving?
- Is that Scatter's plug?
- Yep.
Now, you see that
guy there in the hat?
- That's the head of the cartel.
- How you know?
- The song.
- What are you talking about?
It's a narcocorrido.
Ballads that tell stories
of real-life drug kingpins,
and this one in particular was
about the Gonzalez brothers.
And that's Adalberto.
He's one of 'em.
You would know
some shit like that.
You say brothers.
I see one,
but where's the other one?
What do you think
they talking about?
Drugs, nigga.
You up now?
Negative.
Oh, hell no.
See, going around Scatter
is already enough,
but I'm not going
into Mexico.
Texas is where I draw the line.
I am a domestic nigga.
- I need to stay on this side.
- But we gotta go to the source.
All right?
This is our chance.
No, that's Juarez
on the other side.
I don't want to go nowhere
where the J's is silent.
I need to be able to hear
the J's. I like J's.
If you don't want to go,
you can walk back.
Come on, now, we gotta
do what we gotta do.
They're gonna see us,
and then they're gonna bury us
in the fucking desert.
No, they won't.
Did the song
tell you that, too?
No, the song didn't tell me.
I just know shit.
How 'bout that?
At least tell me
that we have a plan.
We have a plan.
Sort of.
Mexico.
He's turning. Turn.
Turn to the right.
I got it, I got it.
Yo, keep the engine running.
Come on.
Senor Gonzalez.
I know who you are, Priest.
I know everyone
who sells my product.
There are layers
between people like you
and people like me.
Scatter is like
a brother to me.
Your boss.
What the fuck
is up with that?
If you know who I am,
then you know,
in all my years, I've never
once been arrested, not once.
The only record I have is a
juvenile one, and it's sealed.
Now, I've made this risk
'cause although I'm careful,
I'm very ambitious.
Scatter's trying to put
a ceiling over my head,
but I can go much
higher than that.
- And why do I care?
- You care because your mother.
I meant
no disrespect.
No, please elaborate.
They're playing well
this year. Guanajuato.
So far. Are you a fan?
More like a student
of the game.
Really?
And what a season
El Blanco is having! Wow.
Yeah, he's the best.
The best scorer
probably in the league,
but not the best
player on the team.
No, that would be Rafa.
See, Rafa's the defender,
the backbone of the team,
but never scores any goals, so
nobody ever talks about him.
Nobody appreciates him.
El Blanco
may get all the glory,
but he's nothing
without Rafa.
Your mother, queen
of the Gonzalez cartel,
she favors your brother
over you, doesn't she?
What's his name? Augustin?
Oh...
What the fuck do you know
about my family?
So you read Mexican
tabloids, like a housewife?
Where did you
get this one from?
Metro? La Prensa?
Leavenworth Times!
- What?
- That's where I got it from.
I got people
in prison, too.
I'm not your average dope boy, Mr.
Gonzalez.
Don't let the pretty
hair fool you.
I got eyes everywhere.
And?
Information is power.
And power is priceless.
You know that.
What else do you know?
I know that your mother
sees the volume
Augustin's bringing in,
and she thinks
it's 'cause he's bold.
I think it's
'cause he's sloppy.
That's why he's
in Leavenworth right now.
'Cause unlike you, he's messy.
He talks too much.
How else you think I know
all your family business?
So
you're suggesting
that you can distribute
a much higher volume for me
and maintain my relatively
limited exposure?
I wouldn't gamble my life
for no suggestion, now.
Mr. Gonzalez,
allow me to be
your glory.
Thank you.
I'm gonna give you
triple the supply
I was providing Scatter,
to start with.
Sounds good.
But I'm not gonna front it
to you. You'll pay me.
Not a problem.
What the fuck
did they do to your hair?
Oh, boy, I thought I
wasn't gonna see you.
We got motherfucking
work to do now.
You're driving.
Where the hell you been?
Out with friends.
What friends?
Friends like Scatter?
What did I tell you
about him, boy?
You stay around him,
and you'll wind up
in county or in a coffin.
It's because of Scatter
that we pay our bills.
It's because of him
that we can keep this house.
If keeping this house means
you working for that man,
I don't need this damn place!
Get your things and get out!
Mama,
will you just listen, please?
You told me
you'd stop working for Scatter.
- You lied to me!
- I'm doing all of this for you!
Why don't you get that?
Don't give me that.
You're doing it for yourself.
Mama, please, stop!
Hey. Thanks
for finally selling.
It was time for a change.
No shit.
- What is it?
- Sno Patrol got hit.
- I need a all-white casket.
- Of course.
Whatever the family...
Whatever you want.
I want gold handles,
real gold.
Anything different,
your ass gonna be
in one of these caskets.
Of course.
We always do right
by our people, man.
Got to.
We might as well pick out
one for Priest while we here.
- Priest?
- Yeah, Priest.
I'mma handle that nigga.
Don't even worry about it.
What make you so sure
Priest did this?
You ain't seen shit.
We ain't got no word
from the streets yet...
Q, fuck the word
on the street.
Me and him tussle. Now this shit?
Who else you think did this shit?
That ain't Priest's style.
I don't give a fuck
about his style, Q.
- He did it! I'm trying to tell you!
- Hold on, man.
Take some of that motherfucking
bass out your voice!
Fuck wrong with you?
Take care of Miss Mary! That's all
you need to be worried about!
You hear me?
Get, nigga!
A'ight, Q.
Damn, boy! You know
they killed Bin Laden
with one of these
motherfuckers?
Must've been all
that was left of his ass.
Hold on.
Let's hang up
another victim.
I swear I'mma start
naming these motherfuckers.
I need to ask you
something, Eddie.
I did it.
I didn't pull the trigger, but I
definitely pushed the button.
Fat Freddie got it done.
I thought I made
myself clear, Eddie.
What the fuck do you mean,
you made yourself clear?
- I said leave them alone.
- I thought we were partners.
I get a say-so
in this shit, too.
The fuck?
You're my brother, Priest.
Somebody come at my brother.
They come at me.
If they come at me,
they get got.
- You started a war.
- No, I didn't.
They was gonna come
for you regardless.
Fuck Sno Patrol! You
said that shit yourself.
We gonna be long
gone by the time
they're an issue
for us anyway, trust me.
That's the problem, Eddie.
That's the fucking problem.
We are supposed to trust
each other. Are we not?
You don't always have to tell me the truth.
That's not trust.
Me doing right by you,
you doing right by me.
That's trust!
Haven't I always
done right by you?
Whatever, nigga. Just don't
fucking lie to me again.
- I'm serious.
- A'ight.
I don't care what your
definition of trust is, either.
Mmm. You want
to hug it out?
Huh? I'm right here.
Hug this.
God, give me the strength
to lead these people
to righteousness,
to prosperity,
and to a better city.
God, give these good people
the strength to make
the right decision
at the voting booth next month,
for themselves, their family,
and for the blessed
city of Atlanta.
God bless you.
God bless ATL.
Thank you.
Georgia, my goodness,
look at this turnout.
Well, you have a ton
of supporters, Your Honor.
That I may, but not normally
amongst this crowd.
Come work with me already.
I already
work for you, sir.
You are single-handedly
expanding my base.
In the words of Christ
himself, "I have other sheep
"that are not of this pen.
"But I need these also."
And you, my dear,
know all the cool sheep.
Yes, I do.
Wow. Powerful,
isn't it?
It is beautiful.
You know he paints murals
as well, this guy,
out on the streets?
He's known to use
found materials.
Well, some of my favorite
artists use found materials.
I feel it brings a sense
of reality to the work.
Yeah. Of course.
Turning trash into millions.
Mmm. Artists are hustlers.
And everyone loves a hustler,
don't they, Mayor Atkins?
They just can't help it.
Why don't you
show me another piece?
What's wrong
with this piece?
Nothing.
Good.
Because you
just bought it.
- Did I?
- Yes.
How much did I spend?
- I'll talk to you in a minute.
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Thank you. You look so good.
- You look good.
How you doing?
If you left me in a
roach-infested trap house,
I wouldn't feel nearly as
dirty as I do right now
next to His Honor.
Oh, my God, is that
a bathing suit under there?
Baby,
I'm sorry,
- but you've got to stay close to him.
- Why?
- What's the play here?
- There's no play right now.
That's something
for a rainy day.
I got to make a call.
Yo,
are they there yet?
No, not yet.
We have an exhibition
at the San Francisco MOMA
opening next week.
- Okay.
- And I thought it'd be dope
- to do something here, too.
- Are you kidding me?
I would love that. That would
be absolutely amazing.
- Good seeing you.
- Good to see you.
- Take care. Hey.
- I will.
- 'Sup?
- You got to go.
Let me call you back.
This look like a mixtape
release party to you, nigga?
It ain't that
kind of event.
- Bitch, go do your job.
- "Bitch"?
Look,
I got this, baby.
Let's chop it up
downstairs real quick.
I got it, baby. Go on and mingle.
Come on.
So what's
going on, man?
$23,000 for this shit?
She got a better
hustle than we do.
Yeah, she's got
an eye for it.
Funny you should say that.
I lost an eye
the other day.
Yeah, my condolences.
I heard about that.
You sure that's all you
did was hear about it?
Come on, now, Q.
You ever known me to be petty
about some shit like that?
Especially if it ain't got
nothing to do with business.
I wasn't even in the A
when your man got hit.
That don't mean shit. All
it take is one phone call.
It does mean something.
If I was a petty-ass nigga
and wanted to do something
'cause Juju tried
to pull a gun out on me,
don't you think I'd do it myself?
I don't need no damn help.
But I didn't. I didn't make no
calls, and I was out of town.
Where the fuck your boy
Eddie was, though?
With me.
Sure he was.
Congratulations.
After tonight, you stay
away from the gallery.
You hear me?
Yeah, we golden, baby.
Good.
A'ight.
Load this up.
Come on.
You're lucky I don't make you
work naked, motherfucker.
- Hey, do something.
- All right, all right.
Fucking do something.
Yeah!
The manager
will see you now.
Yes, sir.
Fellows.
I say, uh-huh.
Mmm-hmm. And behind
door number one.
Oh, man.
- Cheers to that.
- To the hustle, baby.
Hey, you're my
motherfucking brother.
Answer the phone,
are you deaf?
No, this sport is stupid
and I don't give a shit.
Wow.
You look nice.
Thank you, baby. So do you.
Come downstairs with me.
For what? People won't be
here for another hour.
I know.
Just come downstairs.
All right,
give me a second.
Like today,
though, please.
- Georgia!
- Yes. Coming. Coming.
You hungry?
- Huh?
- I said, are you hungry?
I could eat.
What is this?
Just a little something.
You're too sweet.
Hold up. Hold up.
I got to be a gentleman now.
Oh.
- Madam.
- Thank you.
Wow. Look at this.
That's fine. Thanks.
Takes some getting
used to, you know,
being served
in your own house.
You earned it.
You, all of us, really,
are always exactly
where we're meant to be.
- You believe that?
- I do.
When I was in school,
this girl Janelle
lived like this
her whole life.
In college, her dad
actually got arrested.
He was a big money guy,
something to do
with the financial crisis.
He ripped off
a bunch of old people.
It was a big deal.
Made it to the news.
His case went from
front page news
to back page write-up
about some bullshit fine
and a small settlement.
I learned then
that the difference
between a businessman
and a crook
is the type of lawyer
you can afford.
Is that what you see me as?
As a crook?
No.
I see a man,
my man,
taking care
of his business
and getting things right so
that, when this is all done,
you can be free.
I'm so sorry
about that.
You're fine.
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.
- What up, man?
- Yeah, man.
Hey, I got your
money, too, boy.
- My nigga, what's happening?
- What's up?
- I see you.
- I see you.
What's up, boy?
Thanks for coming.
Ready to get that money?
Finna get that money, son.
- Top to bottom.
- A'ight, player.
Yeah.
- Yo, what up, baby boy?
- What's up, boy?
Hey, man, you still
down to talk, right?
- Yeah.
- Yo.
I really need you
to hear me out, man.
Freddie, you got
to take it easy, now.
I done told you,
I got you. Relax.
Everybody, listen up!
I just want to start off
by saying thank you.
Okay? I want to say
thank you to my team.
I want to say thank you
to every single one of y'all.
I know it's been hard
on you, laying low,
staying off the grid
and still being hard at work,
but y'all been doing that,
and I'm proud of y'all.
So, tonight, we gonna
drink, we gonna eat,
we gonna smoke something
if you have it.
We gonna turn up, a'ight?
So this is to y'all. Salud!
Salud!
- What's going on, baby?
- What's happening? What's happening?
Look, I need you
to fall back a little bit.
Word will get out
about a price drop.
People being how people are,
they'll start asking questions.
You know, asking
how, asking why.
Now, Racks, they find out that
we're flooding the market,
we're gonna have beef we don't need.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Priest, I respect that,
and we don't need no beef.
But for me to move the amount
of work you want me to move,
at the pace you
want me to move,
we got to cut the numbers.
Then cut the numbers.
I don't care.
I just need you to move it
somewhere else.
I got people in Cashville.
They can move whatever the
fuck we throw at 'em.
You got your lane, Freddie.
We don't need these
motherfuckers, man.
Shut the fuck up, man!
- Who the fuck is this motherfucker?
- Hey.
We'll put
that bitch in a hole.
He's a fucking termite.
Everybody, calm down.
We good. We good.
- A'ight? We good.
- Are we good?
- Hey, yeah, we good. We good.
- Listen to me.
Come on, now.
Hey.
I don't like this fat
motherfucker, man.
Look, man, we good.
Don't worry about that shit.
A'ight? We're getting
too much money, baby.
A'ight? Look
at this fucking jacket.
- You look good, nigga.
- We got history to make, baby.
Please tell me what the
fuck just happened.
- That's your boy.
- That was funny as hell.
I almost had
to fight that big nigga.
God, I wanted to see
them niggas roll
in their good clothes.
I really did, though.
No, but seriously, look.
The way shit is
going right now,
like, the numbers
we doing right now,
we should've been
doing since day one.
Shit is moving
smooth like butter.
Like, you a fucking genius,
Priest. I can't even lie.
Who's to say we
can't keep this shit up?
Hmm?
Who's to say we can't be
bigger than the Sno Patrol
with they bitch ass?
Like, seriously, the way
shit is running right now
is the reason we got in the
game in the first place.
Is that a George Daniels
on your wrist?
Oh, yeah.
I ain't show you
this bitch yet, right?
It's nice, but do you
think it's smart
to be wearing that
at this time?
Hmm?
At this party?
These dumb motherfuckers don't
even know what they're looking at.
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm not talking about them, Eddie.
I'm talking
about the police.
One cop sees you wearing
a $600,000 watch,
he's gonna wonder
how that nigga got that.
That's all it takes.
One thread, Eddie. One...
Yeah, to unravel
the whole fucking sweater.
Priest, I get it. God damn!
This fucking preaching.
You know what I'mma do?
I'mma take the watch home. I'm
gonna put it inside a safe,
and put it in another safe,
and then forget
I got the fucking watch.
That make you happy?
Great.
Yo, man, why Priest
do me like that?
- Do you like what, G?
- Yo, all that "stay in your lane" shit.
Because you ain't never sold nothing
a day in your fucking life.
I mean, you the muscle.
Just be the muscle.
No, man, but the shit we got
fucking sells itself, nigga.
Man, it ain't
that simple, man.
Man, then why don't you
let me prove myself, huh?
You're giving work
to everybody else,
and I been here
since fucking day one, man.
How do you think it feels to watch all
these motherfuckers get caked up?
Eddie.
Yo, Eddie.
Man, look,
I'll give you one brick.
- Thank you, man.
- You happy?
- Appreciate you, man.
- Well, appreciate this ass.
That's what you need
to be appreciating.
- These asses.
- I fucking knew it.
Oh, shit. Yo, baby.
- Baby...
- Yeah. No, no, no.
Don't give me
that calm voice shit.
This bitch your side chick?
This bitch?
Trust me. You don't want
to see it with this bitch!
- Bitch, I will whup your ass!
- Oh, no, chill, ladies.
- We'll talk about this later.
- Talk about what?
Talk about how you putting
all our business
- on the line for this trick?
- Bitch!
Oh!
Come on, man.
No! No!
- Stupid bitch!
- I will beat your ass!
You better get her!
Our guy been
up to anything?
Since getting back
from El Paso? Not much.
Living life like a retiree,
except with younger women.
Doesn't seem like he's
up to much, you ask me.
What's the buzz
been about at the precincts?
- Concerning?
- Narcotics.
Has law enforcement noticed
any change
in the market at all?
Recent influx
of pills locally.
- Charlotte, too, from what I've heard.
- Hmm.
All right, well,
here you are.
It's all there.
That's not lemon pepper?
Hawaiian.
Trying something new.
Aren't we all?
- You sure about this?
- Positive.
That nigga say he
gonna lay one on me?
Well, he didn't
tell me that.
I'm gonna need you to better
explain yourself, a'ight?
Look, he's been acting
real funny lately,
so I just knew he was seeing
somebody on the side.
Always lying about
where he been at.
- How you know he was lying?
- Because I went on his phone.
- Turned the locator on.
- Fuck all that.
Tell us what we
want to hear.
Look, the day
you got shot at,
Fat-Ass told me he was
gonna cop some sneakers
down in Little Five Points.
But he wasn't there.
Same date, same time,
same location as the shooting.
Technology's a bitch.
So is a woman scorned.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Here he comes.
You ever kill a bitch
with a dick in her mouth?
Yo, take that shit off.
- What, baby, my shirt?
- Take that fucking shirt off.
Cops. Duck.
Bring it over here.
Bring it here.
Ooh.
Oh...
Oh. Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up.
Get the fuck up.
I don't know if it's that nigga's
lucky day or his unlucky day.
Fuck!
Don't say a fucking word.
Don't say shit.
Having
ourselves a night, are we?
Is there a problem, Officer?
How much you charging,
sweetheart?
Hey, I ain't
a fucking prostitute.
Yo, chill. Don't say
fucking shit before this...
Before this officer asks you
to step out of the car?
It's too late.
Step out of the car, please.
God damn it. God damn it.
Fucking told you!
Get the fuck up out the car!
- I told you not to say shit!
- Let's go.
Jackpot.
Let's go. Get the fuck
out of the car.
All right.
Gun. Cocaine.
- It's all yours, right?
- I want a lawyer.
"A lawyer"?
You're not under arrest.
Did you arrest him?
Uh-uh.
Just having a conversation
in a public place.
That's a whole lot
of cocaine, man.
Can't all be for
personal use, can it?
Don't want to talk?
All right.
Wow.
You're amongst friends.
I insist.
Know what my
problem with you is?
This shit's way too pure,
and you got way too much of it
for me to not know
who the fuck you are.
Still silent. All right.
Say "cheese."
You're making
my life too easy.
All right. "Eddie."
Most of your texts and
calls are to this guy.
Can't be your boyfriend.
You got way too many pussy
pics to be on the down-low.
What is he, your connect?
No. Nah.
See, you're not connected.
Your boss, right?
Bingo.
"Eddie."
You know an Eddie
who's getting it like this?
- Not like that.
- See, now I'm really pissed
'cause that's two people
I should know that I don't.
Get her out of the car.
Let's go, sweetheart.
No! No,
please don't do it! Don't do it.
- Tell me who Eddie is.
- Don't say a fucking word.
I just...
Big man's working
for Eddie, right?
Yeah. Eddie.
Him and Priest.
"Priest"?
Damn.
I don't know
who he is, either.
But I do now.
You gonna take
your girl home.
And drive carefully.
You gonna
see me around.
Let's go.
Get the fuck out.
Let's go.
Come on.
Motherfucker.
What was I
supposed to do, Freddie?
Baby, they were
gonna kill you.
I ain't mad at you.
I just got to figure out
how to tell Priest
about this shit.
Look at this motherfucker.
Look at this motherfucker.
What does he want now?
Can I see your license
and registration, please, sir?
Look, man,
you really need to see
- my motherfucking license...
- Hands off the gun.
- What?
- Hands off the gun!
The cops saved
that nigga life, Q.
I'm gonna have that bitch
set up Fat Freddie
next time, though.
Freddie might have
been the shooter.
I ain't gonna doubt that.
But Freddie don't
call no shots, though.
And if we make
a move on him right now,
we gonna wake Priest up.
We need him sleep.
Fuck Freddie.
Q, what the fuck is you talking
about, "Fuck Freddie..."
Listen, nigga! This shit
is chess, not checkers.
Once we knock the king off,
the rest of the pieces
on the board
don't even fucking matter.
If I have to, I'll kill that pussy-ass
nigga Priest my goddamn self.
Yo, boss.
...Frederick Davis
and 25-year-old Rochelle Saunders.
Police say that
Davis did not comply
with instructions
and reached for a gun.
That's when
the officer fired.
Based on the initial report,
Mayor Atkins believes
the shooting to be justified
and is calling the officer,
Turk Franklin, a hero.
Hands off the gun.
Hands off the gun!
Yeah, we're here for
anything that you need.
All right? Anything.
All right. Sorry
for your loss, Ms. Davis.
I will. Bye.
Something ain't right.
Yeah, something ain't right.
They fucking murdered him!
- Can I help you?
- What do you guys do in here?
This a Mickey Mouse
Clubhouse?
Uh, it's our place of business.
You mind telling us yours?
Oh, I'm Detective Mason.
This here is Officer Franklin.
He's become a little bit
of a local celebrity,
if you hadn't heard.
Oh, this is nice.
Well, you can talk to our
lawyers if you have any...
"Lawyer"? That must be
the company slogan.
That's exactly
what Freddie said.
Not that you want the same thing
to happen to you, do you?
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, too!
- For real!
- How much?
Now, see, when
you say it like that,
it makes me feel like
this is a shakedown.
- Franklin, is this a shakedown?
- Definitely.
This is a place
of business, right?
We're gonna be partners.
We don't just offer
that to anybody.
Like Sno Patrol.
They got multiple
investigations on them
at multiple agencies.
They could go down
at any minute.
I've been waiting
a long time
to find someone who operates
with your kind of discretion.
How much?
Partners means partners.
Fifty-fifty.
- We'll earn our share, right?
- That's right.
Heads-up on raids, patrols,
et cetera, et cetera.
But in the meantime,
I feel like
we need to have some kind
of goodwill gesture.
Let's say a million-dollar gesture.
By the end of the week.
Deal?
Hey. Deal?
Say it.
Come on, Priest,
just say it.
Deal.
Attaboy.
Thanks, man.
I get it.
He scares the shit
out of me, too.
Before we go,
I think this belongs to you.
Son of a bitch!
You're the reason
we're in this shit.
- What?
- You're the reason that Freddie's dead.
Fuck you, Priest.
I'm wrong?
If you didn't give him that
brick, he'd still be alive.
If you didn't
want to expand,
I would've never gave him
the fucking brick!
He wanted to get put on.
There's no coming
back from that.
Now we in the bed with the
fucking police forever.
Not forever. It's gonna
take longer than I thought
'cause of your dumb ass, but
we stick to the plan, Eddie.
What plan?
You still talking about
this dumb-ass shit
about us getting out the game
and finding somewhere
safe to land?
We black men!
There ain't nowhere safe
on this fucking planet!
So what you wanna do?
You want to stay here, right?
That's our best
fucking option!
We rolling with
the police now.
It's in their best interest to
protect us and keep us out of jail.
Until it isn't!
Until they do to us
what they did to Freddie
'cause they own you
until they kill you.
Why are you such
a goddamn fool, nigga?
Me? Who got us
into this shit?
You did this shit,
Priest! Not me!
Eddie, touch me again,
nigga. I swear...
- What the fuck you gonna do, Priest?
- Touch me...
What the fuck
you gonna do, Priest?
Motherfucker!
Yeah!
Fuck you doing, Priest?
You motherfucker!
Fuck!
I've been in touch
with the consulate
where we can be citizens of a
country with no extradition treaty.
- The police can't touch us.
- They're not police.
- They're murderers.
- If they're murderers,
how else we gonna
get rid of them?
We don't.
We get rid of ourselves.
These dirty-ass cops, Sno
Patrol, they're violating us.
We shouldn't have
to run from anyone.
We should wipe them all out.
Now, who gonna do
all that gangsta shit, you?
If I have to.
I've done this shit,
remember?
Then what?
Hmm?
You're gonna end up
on the run anyway,
or you're gonna end up
in a cage, so stop it.
- We have enough to leave.
- It's not enough.
What's enough?
$2 million? 5? 25?
Or until you end up
like Fat Freddie?
I don't give a damn
about any of that shit.
I give a damn about you.
Think, Priest,
about everything
that you've built.
Don't be so quick
to throw it all away
just 'cause you're
going through some shit.
I can't believe you
right now.
- Yeah, 'cause you're fucking soft.
- "Soft"?
I've had his back
since day one,
and I had your back
since day one,
so don't give me not shit
about being soft...
- Stop. Stop!
- Everything is warm and fuzzy to you.
Both of you shut the fuck up!
I don't know who you think
you're talking to!
But I am on your side, okay? I'm
trying to get us out of this!
Look. Look, you're right. You're right.
You're right, okay?
We're gonna get our money.
We're gonna get our passports,
and after Freddie's funeral,
we will get away for good.
Do you understand?
Another option to gain a passport
is to invest $1.5 million U.S.
into a government-approved
real estate project,
and you can have your citizenship
for only $500,000 each.
Do you take cash?
Well, of course.
Get in the car. Make sure Ms.
Davis is all right.
- Priest, but we...
- Just get in the car, please.
What is he doing here?
Oh, I'm on
mandatory leave.
It's standard procedure after
an officer-involved shooting.
Figured I'd pay my respects
to the money you owe us.
Jesus. Clearly,
this was a bad idea.
Why don't you just give us
what we came for.
We'll get out of your
silky smooth hair.
Were you beaten as a child?
All the time.
Nice bag.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
No offense.
Trust has to be
earned, right?
It's good.
Think you got it bad?
I got to work with
this guy every day.
My condolences.
You reaching for the burner
in the center trap?
- I know how you think.
- Scatter...
Shut the fuck up.
So you put a man
on me, huh?
That's cool. I could
put a man on you, too.
- Scatter, I have a plan. I've been...
- Shh.
Come on, let's take a ride.
Look, will you just take
this L, Scatter, please?
Get out while you still can.
Take the L, huh?
You know, there's a difference
between getting out
and being pushed out.
I won't stand for that,
Youngblood.
You literally could've taken
any kid off the corner
and put him under your wing,
but you chose me.
- Why?
- Them other young boys, back then,
they only wanted to hustle
for the money and the flash.
Everybody want to be somebody.
Want to be a trap star.
Want to be superfly.
Not you.
You were different.
Cared less about that stuff.
Who the fuck is that?
It's Priest. My man I
was telling you about.
- He got it all planned out.
- So these fools think
they can come in my cut
and set up a trap, huh?
Without even checking in?
Well, time to pay the tax.
Man, why don't we
just spray 'em?
Nah, man, pulling that trigger
ain't gonna make it no better.
In fact,
it'll make it worse.
See, the trick is, you got to
get past that guard out front.
Hey, he's about to be
gone in a minute.
How the fuck
you know that?
He thinks
he's about to meet
an 18-year-old freshman
from Georgia State.
I been catfishing him
for about a month now, so...
A month, you say?
That's a pretty big
commitment, youngblood.
Okay. Are you ready?
One of the main
things I admired about you
was the fact that
you thought big.
Look at your clothes,
for example.
I taught you how to dress,
but you took it way, way left.
With your Morris
Day-looking hair.
Excuse me? Who the...
Who the fuck is Morris Day?
Is it true, Priest?
You were gonna
leave town?
Abandon our business?
No. Never.
Look, he's mad
'cause he got cut out.
I don't blame him for that,
but he's lying.
Adalberto, how many years I been
working for you and your family?
Have I ever lied to you?
As a matter fact,
Scatter, you have.
This is an
alkaline hydrolysis machine.
It's much friendlier on the
environment than cremation.
You and I, Priest,
we share similar values.
We both abhor
unnecessary violence.
My brother Augustin on the other
hand, he was out of control.
You obviously are aware
of his reputation.
That's why I had
to send him to prison.
That's right.
I sent my own
brother to prison.
My own stereotypical,
ruthless,
bloody kingpin, who was
eventually gonna bring down
the whole family. No.
That's unacceptable.
I know you can
understand that, Priest.
You, you're better
than advertised.
You're better than
Scatter ever was.
So good that
I had to question myself.
Scatter had always been
one of our best earners.
So how come your numbers
were so much better?
Even after adjusting
for the increase in volume.
Didn't make sense.
So I had to take a closer
look at his business.
A much closer look.
He was
stealing from me.
A little skim
every other month.
Not much.
But he knew
better than that.
And now that he's gone,
there's no way
you're leaving the game.
Good night, Priest.
Drive safely.
Yes, sir.
Go buy yourself
some new fits.
Why, so we can buy some
crazy-ass clothes like you?
Yeah, I know I must be looking
real crazy to you right now,
but do you know why
a tiger has stripes?
Why a lion has a mane?
It's to warn the other animals that
they are not to be fucked with.
Stop by tomorrow.
Got some more work for y'all.
Ain't too many shorties know
how to work the long game.
Baby, you got to talk to me.
What's going on?
Scatter, he took me
to the connect,
and they killed him.
They what?
They ain't never
gonna let me out.
Never.
Priest, we have to leave.
I know.
Call Cynthia.
- Cyn!
- Cynthia?
- Cynthia, where are you? Cyn?
- Cyn? Cynthia?
What's up?
Okay, why are you not dressed?
What's going on?
Look, I understand that this
is serious, but, like...
No, no, I don't think
you understand...
I understand better
than the both of y'all.
Okay? The shit that
we're going through now,
that's what happens
when you grow.
You either have the heart
for it, or you don't.
We're gonna
weather the storm.
"Weather the storm." Okay, we're
just gonna leave your shit here.
All right? Come on.
Upstairs. Go.
- Fuck!
- Come on!
Get 'em!
Go, go, go!
Run like a bitch!
Get down! Down!
Get down,
nigga! Move!
Okay.
You motherfucker!
Shoot up! Shoot her!
Cynthia.
Come here. Come here!
Fuck!
Get up. Georgia, get up.
Open this.
Here, open this.
You next, Priest!
I'm gonna box them in.
All right? You go
from that side.
Come on.
Fuck!
- Come on!
- I'm here!
Nah, nigga!
- Come on! Come on!
- I can't do that.
- That's fire.
- You pussy!
Come on!
- No, no, no, no, no! Watch out!
- I got it! I got it!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
I'mma kill this bitch.
Grab my gun.
I'm gonna come around.
You shoot out the windshield
so he can't see.
Now!
What the fuck?
I pray to God I don't remember
anything about this day.
I keep thinking about Cynthia's
last moment before she...
She must have
been so scared.
I'm sorry.
For all this.
What are we
gonna do now?
I don't know.
Scatter was right.
This is all on me.
Today's a rainy day.
It's time to use it.
If we do this,
there's no going back.
There never was.
Hands up!
Get your hands up!
He's in the city
or out the city somewhere.
Call your people, and go
put a hole in this nigga.
I don't care if we got to
leave the whole damn country.
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you. Yo, Ju.
I think our boy has something
he wants to tell you.
Look at this fucking crib.
- It's nice, huh? I know that.
- Yeah, this motherfucker nice.
Yeah,
this is all me now.
Oh, yeah. I like.
What the fuck
do you want, nigga?
Talk!
I want to join
the winning team.
Get the fuck
out here! Now!
- Step back!
- Now, boy!
- Don't move!
- Don't move, nigga.
This what the
winning team look like.
You switching up
on your boy Priest so quick?
Priest ain't my boy,
not no more.
Them days over.
Priest still in town?
Yeah.
And he trying
to make a move.
But he gonna need
some money to do it.
I know where
the money is.
I mean, I could tell you, but, you
know, I need some guarantees.
All right,
well, let's go get him.
Yo, Priest!
Priest!
- Don't move!
- Don't move!
- Cease fire, cease fire!
- Clear!
Nice work, boys.
Hello?
It's done.
Yeah.
We ain't got to worry
about Sno Patrol no more.
Good.
Welcome,
citizens of this great city.
Just like I told you all
when you elected me mayor,
we would be creating
these community centers,
and I'm proud
to open another one.
Thank you.
God bless Atlanta.
Don't forget
to get out and vote.
Mr. Mayor, you mind
if I get a selfie with you?
Well, of course.
- Yes, sir.
- Party time.
- Let's get it. Let's get it.
- Hello, Mr. Mayor.
Oh, shit!
God damn! Let's go!
ATL, ho! Let's go!
- It's pretty good, right?
- What you want, man?
I want a few things. I want
you to make some calls.
I want you to pull some
strings, get me a file.
Do that, I won't just
give you this video.
- I'll give you something else.
- What's that?
The election.
Informed on
your own brother...
...you're worse than a rat.
Worse than any creature that
has walked on this Earth.
It's lies!
This is fake document!
Please don't call this
fake news.
You've been spending
too much time in America.
Mama...
I did it for the sake
of the family, mama!
I did it for us!
For the family? That's crap.
Augustin is a pain in the ass and
occasionally stupid, very stupid.
But he never ratted on the
family when he went to prison.
I would have respected you
more if you killed him.
Mama, don't do this! Please!
Please!
...I beg you! I'm your son!
No, you WERE my son.
At one time we shared
the same blood.
And now you will become...?
No! No!
...whatever it is this fucking
machine turns you into.
No! No!
You fucking asshole! No!
No! Mama!
Mommy!
Fuck!
Yo, Priest.
Where you at?
- It's payday.
- I'm on my way.
You better be after what
I just did for you.
Well, for us, actually.
I mean, we are
partners, right?
You hear me?
Sno Patrol, done.
Took care
of your little problem.
Nah. I take care
of my own problems.
Priest? Hello?
Motherfucker.
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Stay right there!
Stop! Put your hands up!
- Atlanta PD!
- Don't move!
On
Wednesday, a dramatic arrest
occurred downtown
of a career detective
in the Atlanta
Police Department.
With this and the recent takedown
of the local drug ring Sno Patrol,
polling indicates that Mayor
Atkins has a six-point lead
over all other candidates and is
expected to run away with the election.
He made
the following statement.
When
I was first elected,
I promised to weed out
corruption in the Atlanta PD.
I'm a man of God and a man of my word,
and I look forward to continue guiding
this fine city of Atlanta
towards the light
of a bright
and prosperous future.
Surprised you made it
with all this heat.
Nothing gonna keep me
from my money.
You're not nervous?
I made a few phone calls.
They ain't got shit on me.
I'm a hero.
Mayor himself said so.
See, he can't have me
looking dirty,
especially when
there's an election at stake.
Let's go.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit. No, no, no.
No, no, no.
All right, hold on, chill.
Chill the fuck out.
Let's talk this through.
Oh, like how you
talked to Freddie?
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Fuck, man. Stop.
No, no, no.
The dream
was always to get out.
I just didn't know
how far I'd have to go.
How do you feel?
Right now?
Mmm-hmm.
Free.
You think you're
gonna miss home?
Come on, now.
I am home.
Besides, we can
always go back.
Okay, baby, smile.
Look.
Tell him I said hi.
- My brother.
- My brother.
You know you're
missing out, now.
I know, but...
You know, that's all you.
That never was me.
Well, there's always a spot
out here if you ever need it.
I mean that.
Oh, for sure. For sure.
Till the re-up, baby.
Till the re-up.
Peace.
Got to make
this money, man.
A'ight.
Who want their
shot at the king?
Let's go, baby.
Hand me the crown!
Yeah, I left America.
But I damn sure took the
dream with me, didn't I?
And that's superfly.
