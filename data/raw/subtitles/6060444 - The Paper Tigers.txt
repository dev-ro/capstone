But I won, Sifu.
I won for our honor.

{\an8}We're gonna be rich!
{\an8}Japan, Japan, Japan!
Shi-Gong, welcome
the new disciples to our clan.
I swear I will always honor
my sifu.
I will be loyal to my brothers
and I will defend the weak.
This I promise as a disciple
to the very day I die.
Right.
Come on, man,
someone please leave.
Anybody, anybody?
Are you leaving?
There.
Here we go, here we go.
Yo! Okay, yeah, just go through.
All right.
Don't... don't put...
Don't put it...
Oh, come on.
Just put it in!
Come on!
- I'll be back in a minute, lady.
- What, you can't!
- Just one minute, just one.
- Ah, uh... your car.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Which one's the fastest?
Your call has been forwarded
to an automated
voice messaging system.
I'm sorry, baby,
he's not answering.
Could you call again?
Honey, I don't think
we can keep on waiting.
Hey, we can go
to the comic store.
You know, another weekend
reading with mom?
No, yeah.
I'm sick of that, too.
Boom!
Hey, buddy.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
But I had to go I clear across
town to get you this, like it?
- Yeah!
- Yeah? It's cool, right?
Just look at that little antenna
too so check it out.
You got a supercharger here
and it's really cool,
it's really amazing.
Hey, Caryn!
You're looking great,
I love the hair.
It's very now.
Ever the charmer.
Mm-hm, yeah.
So we really should get going.
I got a big day ahead of us.
Hey, a big day.
What you got planned?
Well, we got the whole weekend
ahead of us to, you know,
two full days
of all kinds of stuff.
- Stuff?
- Mm-hm.
Well, day and a half now, so...
Nah, it's plenty of time.
To?
To go to...
Magic Land.
Ma... Magic Land?
- You got it, buddy.
- Magic Land?
It was supposed to be
a surprise,
but, hey, did you bring
swim trunks?
Don't worry about it. We could
pick some up on the way.
Hey, isn't that a bit much?
By the time you get through
the gates, it'll be dark.
We're gonna make it, I promise.
- I promise.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Okay.
Yes!
- Hey.
- Hmm?
You said you wanted
50/50, right?
When you say you're gonna
do something, do it.
My word is bond.
Cross my heart, hope to die.
I got it.
There's fireworks,
we gotta stay for that.
- Yes!
- 10:00 p.m., I think, uh...
that should be pretty fun.
Okay, all right.
There he is. That's him!
All right, all right, calm down.
I'll take care of it.
- Hey, bud, is this you?
- Yep, it is.
I told her I'd be back
in a minute.
- A minute?
- Don't worry about it.
I had an appointment!
I've been here for 10,
she's been here for 20.
- I'm late!
- Hey!
- I'm talking to you, dork!
- Mm, hi.
You think you own this place?
Don't you people know
how to park?
No, can't park, can't drive,
can't help it.
- Dad?
- Yeah, buddy?
Do you know any kung fu?
First of all,
it's called Gung Fu.
That's how we say it in Chinese.
But, no, I don't, why?
I saw pictures.
- Where?
- In the garage.
There's a bunch of pictures.
All right, all right,
you got me.
That was a very, very, very
long time ago.
Who's the old guy?
The old guy?
That was our teacher.
We called him "Sifu".
- You know what that means?
- Mm-mm.
Si means master.
Fu means father.
Can you show me Gung Fu?
What for?
Listen, a lot of boneheads think
they can solve everything
with their fists,
like that guy back there, right?
You know what to do?
You do what dad did,
you just be a bigger man
and walk away.
Hey, so what's the first thing
you wanna do in Magic Land, huh?
Mount Splash!
Mount Splash, that's right.
Now we're gonna do that first
and then we're gonna do...
- Vanilla Chunky Pie!
- Vanilla Chunky Pie!
That's right.
Please don't answer.
Please, please, don't.
Hello?
Wait, what do you mean
it didn't go through?
We, we had everything
signed for.
I understand,
I'm on it right now.
I give you my word
that it's gonna be fixed
before you get
to the office, yes.
Getting really heavy,
you know that?
Ah!
Tiger pounces on cave!
Come on, show me what you got!
- No.
- Seriously, nothing?
- Oh!
- What about now?
- What about now?
- Jesus.
- Ah Hing?
- Yeah!
What are you, crazy?
What the hell's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
I... Whoa.
Hey, kid. He yours?
Hey.
He's a good-looking kid.
Doesn't look like you at all.
How can you forget?
I mean,
"Tiger pounces from cave!"
You just sink, twist under,
elbow strike!
Wanna go again?
I'm retired.
Look at that.
A Gung Fu man's always ready,
Dai Si-Hing.
You doing all right?
What, this?
Fell off a scaffold at work
about ten years ago.
Shit, man.
Yeah, it was their busted
equipment anyways.
Now I get a fat check
every month
for the rest of my life.
Hmm. Pretty sweet.
Sifu taught you
Chinese medicine.
Don't you have like some way
to heal it?
You didn't hear?
Sifu's dead.
What?
Heart attack.
Out behind the restaurant.
The other cooks found him
in the morning.
He must have been there
the whole night.
How, how was he doing?
Was he sick at all?
I haven't seen the old man
in 15 years.
I'm lucky
I still found you here.
Funeral's tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I'll drop Ed off with his mom.
Should we tell Jim?
I'm not going if he's going.
Hey, buddy.
We're gonna go and do Magic Land
next weekend, okay?
I swear.
Buddy.
I need you to do me
one last thing.
If your mom asks
about yesterday,
tell her that we went to
Magic Land like we said we did.
Isn't that lying?
Yes.
Yes, it is,
but it would hurt her even more
if she found out
that we didn't go.
She might not let us spend time
together anymore.
Don't you wanna see me again?
Promise to say we went?
Promise.
You begged me to do 50/50.
You wanted to be a part of this.
And now you drop off
your son
like he's some sort of pet?
Danny, stop making me out
to be the bad guy.
Call me back.
Ed?
Ed.
Did he even take you
to Magic Land?
We had Vanilla Chunky Pie.
Shit, it's Carter.
Where?
- Ah, yeah, that's him.
- Yeah.
He's a lot bigger.
All right, here they come.
- Sifu Wong.
- Sifu Wong.
Eh, just the two of you?
What about, Ah...
Oh, uh, Ah Jim? Uh...
- He's, uh, really busy.
- Yeah.
Do you have the funeral cloth?
Uh...
Wait here.
There's a lot more people
- than I thought.
- Yeah.
A great Gung Fu master
deserves nothing less.
It's a disgrace his disciples
don't show their faces
until today.
How you doing, Carter?
Sifu Carter.
I run the school now.
Well, Carter...
Not that I have to explain
anything to you
but I just heard
about everything last night.
Well, my Sifu took care of
all this here, doing your job.
Showing up late to the funeral
dressed in thrift-store suits,
totally shameful.
You look skinny,
what are you, sick?
You don't look skinny,
what are you, sick?
I'm not fat, I'm bloated.
We just had pasta.
Pasta for breakfast?
That's right, breakfast pasta.
You never heard of it?
Sounds really healthy.
You look like
a fat Asian Mr. Rogers.
You know, you should really
watch the testosterone
because it makes your...
Here.
I've been doing a lot
of push-ups, core workouts.
Chest got a lot bigger.
Yeah.
- I got you.
- Just...
- Watch, watch the hair.
- Okay, no, don't worry.
Hey, hey, hey, yo, let's take
a picture with the master, yeah?
Little selfie style,
cuz, yes, sir.
Let's see, this...
that's one's a good one.
{\an8}- Mm-hm, that's...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do something.
They're making it look like
he was their sifu.
Let's take these K-pop rejects.
Hang on.
I don't think Sifu would want
a brawl at his funeral.
You guys are useless!
What'd he say?
You know, before any
of you were even born,
I was a cook
just like your Sifu.
He lent me the money
to open this school.
I always told him that he could
open a school, too,
and have more students,
and have a bigger family.
I think Sifu
was just happy being a cook
and... teaching us.
Yeah, "The Three Tigers
of Sifu Cheung."
Do you know
if he was sick at all?
Shouldn't you know?
I read the autopsy.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
That means
his heart beat irregularly
to the point of failure.
Common causes
are congenital heart disease,
inordinate stress,
pre-existing conditions.
You sound so sure.
I work in insurance.
And Sifu smoked a pack a day
so I guess we can't be
too surprised.
Doctors.
Westerners cannot see
what Gung Fu sees.
Yeah, those pesky Westerners.
Let me tell you what, Carter...
Sifu Carter!
- Listen, if you ask me...
- Uh, which I'm not.
If you ask me...
there was no heart attack.
- And if I were you...
- Which you're not.
If I were you...
I'd start with those punks.
Those kids have no respect
for any of the old ways.
Speaking of old ways, Sifu Wong,
Ah Hing and I were talking.
And we think it's probably best
that Sifu's ashes
stayed with you.
But we're two different clans.
Yeah.
But I think Sifu would be happy
in a place where Gung Fu
is at least practiced.
Why not open your own school?
Yeah.
We Chinese have a saying.
"A teacher for even one day
becomes a father
for a lifetime."
A fortune cookie
made with white flour.
Relax.
Sifu Wong, thank you again
for everything.
What else do you know
about those kids?
Gung Fu orphans.
They never had a Sifu
to teach them anything proper
so they just go out
in the street
and practice on their own.
Listen, those kids
will lie and cheat
just to build up a name
for themselves.
They could take those photos
from the funeral
and claim your Sifu
was their master.
You care at all about your Sifu,
I'd find out exactly
what they were doing that night.
What if he was
on to something?
The Gung Fu meathead?
Yeah, I think I'll side with
a certified coroner on this one.
Sifu was so strict
with his morals.
He could have set anyone off.
What if he rubbed the kids
the wrong way, too?
Okay, look, this is where
they found him.
But why would Sifu come
all the way down here
and not out to the street?
Well, I don't think
you have a say
when you're having
a heart attack.
Are you done, Magnum?
Just let the man rest in peace.
Then we could all move on.
Something's not right.
What?
Go!
Ah!
Oh, come on!
Okay, that's not happening.
That guy's so fast!
Good form, too.
We need Jim.
Down, down!
Got him where you want him,
now reel him on in.
What are you dancing for?
You gotta get in there
and take him down, bruh.
Get in there and take him down!
- Yeah!
- Oooh woo!
Yeah!
What'd I told you, huh?
Stingray, baby!
Stingray.
That's not gonna work
with Doc Howard.
He's tougher than this man.
No, 'cause his hands can't hit
what he can't reach.
'Cause I always stay
one step away.
You gotta go to the ground!
Dammit.
Ah, yeah.
Doesn't this get you
all juiced up?
No.
Nice.
Nothing like
Fighting like...
Now what?
No, now whip your leg.
Start with your feet
and do it right.
More, get up faster!
- You hear that?
- What?
He ain't really kicking
that bag, man.
He's gotta turn over
his hip.
Faster, faster.
See, speed kills.
Hey!
You got anal blindness?
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
Do you have anal blindness?
Um, no.
Then why can't your ass see
I'm working over here?
Oh, we're... I'm sorry, sir,
we were just...
At least this ass can see
that that's a shitty kick.
The hell you talking about?
Kick's got no power.
Even my big brother
can tell you that.
No power, huh?
And what the hell
would you know about power?
I don't hear it.
When he hits the bag,
the sound isn't good.
It's... it's too fat.
Too fat?
Yeah, you gotta have
a sharp sound.
Just using his leg
isn't good enough.
You gotta control all that power
through your body
from the ground up.
That's Chinese Gung Fu.
See if you do it right,
you can hear the power.
All right, Kung Fu Panda.
Why don't you show us
something, huh?
Let me hear how kung fu's
supposed to sound.
Might help if you turn up
your hearing aid, but...
I'll show you.
You sure about this?
Yeah, man, a little dojo busting
like the old days.
Let's do this.
I'll show you how it's done.
I just gotta warm up first,
you know.
Now see, if it's too close,
it's no good.
If it's one step away further,
lose a lot of power.
It's gotta be... just right.
All I hear is your mouth,
fathopper.
Argh!
Oh, God!
That sounds fat all right.
That's how kung fu
supposed to sound?
Ooh!
Goddamn socks!
I'll show you some realGung Fu,
- Fred Sanford!
- Step up!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Come on!
Let's go, Sanford, let's go!
Ah Hing?
These fools with you?
Yeah, they with me.
Three Tigers back again!
So...
And I got nothing
No, I got nothing
Without you, baby
You know the last time
I saw Dai Si-Hing,
he was drinking me
under the table in Japan.
Yeah.
When was that, '93?
Yeah.
Let's keep drinking.
All you gotta be is 20
to drink in Japan, right?
So we flew in that night,
that first night in Tokyo.
We went to town, man.
And we tried to come back
to the hotel, but I'm out.
Nothing's waking me up.
No alarm, no earthquake,
no Godzilla.
You know what I'm saying?
So I get up the next evening
and go to find Dai Si-Hing,
and he's checked out
of his room.
He disappears before his fight.
Who cares?
This was 25 years ago, come on.
- We forfeited.
- Forfeited.
I was your second, man.
My name
was on the line, too.
Own it, bruh.
Danny Eight Hands,
you punked out.
Hey, come on, come on.
Come on, guys.
We're brothers.
I mean I love you, guys,
man, come on.
You know what's funny?
You guys arguing like this,
but in 25 years neither of you
ever reached out for me.
But it's not
about that, right?
It's about Sifu.
Sifu.
- Sifu.
- Sifu.
Sifu was a beast, man.
You sure those kids could
have done something to him?
Let's just get it done.
Damn it!
I've told you so many times.
You have to kick higher.
Kick higher,
where's your energy at?
- What are you doing?
- I've already told you.
Hey, punk-ass,
you dropped that.
The Three Tigers of Sifu Cheung.
Sorry, we didn't recognize you
from before, I mean,
you look like
you ate half of that guy.
And homie,
man, you been fasting
for 20 years or what?
You used to be the man.
So you knew Sifu Cheung?
The cooks told us
you all work together.
What were you gonna do with
those photos at the funeral?
A great master
deserves true disciples.
He already has them.
What do you punk-asses know
about being a true disciple?
- Show him.
- What?
Oh, jeez. You should have
been ready for this.
I wasn't expecting you
to do that.
See this?
Nice rash, bitch.
This makes him
the official clan inheritor,
our Dai Si-Hing!
You guys have that?
Nope, posers.
But that don't mean shit
unless you live up to it.
People paid big money
to fly him to Japan
to be a professional fighter.
You know why?
Because he's Danny Eight Hands,
the Destroyer!
We're wasting our time here.
Better make
that shit count, homie.
Anytime you want, nigga.
Boy, what you say to me?
- Oh, hell no.
- Oh.
I said knuckle up, nigga!
You heard me.
Catch this fade, homie!
Square up, let's go!
Shh. Okay, okay, wait,
hold, hey, hey!
Boy, you don't want
any of this, bruh.
- Let's go.
- I'm telling you right now!
- Walk away, man.
- Dai Si-Hing!
We can't let these bitch asses
- talk to us like that.
- Exactly!
They offended Sifu, one.
Two, they offended family, okay?
That's Ah Jim right here.
If we don't do anything,
that makes him look weak.
- Exactly.
- And that makes him oppressed.
We defend the oppressed
because we're like the
Martin Luther Kings
of martial arts.
That's three strikes
right there.
That's actually just two.
It doesn't matter,
we're good to go!
I was... I was actually with you
up until that last part
about Dr. King,
this is not true.
These sushi-eating motherfuckers
have offended us.
I like sushi.
We gotta let 'em know.
Dai Si-Hing.
You got my back or what?
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- You feel that?
- Okay. Yeah.
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's go get their asses.
- We got these guys.
All right.
- You want beimo?
- Hell, yeah.
First to knock out,
best of three.
If we win, you tell us
everything we need to know.
And when we win?
Yeah, mm-hm, win? Pfft!
If you beat us,
I guess that means
we're not undefeated anymore.
You guys can be
the new Three Tigers.
- You'll give us the name?
- Mm-hm.
How do we believe you?
Because that's what we do.
Sifu would always say,
Gung Fu without honor
is just fighting.
You're on, old pops.
Get ready for an ass whooping
of a lifetime, just, uh...
I got vertigo,
I can't go down this way.
- Let's go this way.
- You son of a bitch.
Which way?
Uh, what are you doing?
Hang on, hang on, Ah Jim!
Wait, where you guys going?
Beimo.
Whoa.
Okay, hang on a second.
You see, uh...
seniors usually go last
in beimo.
You know, the whole seniority...
thing.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go, pops.
Ooh! That's whassup!
- Come on, Danny.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How's that feel, old man?
- Let's go...
- Come on, Danny, let's go!
Let's go, Dai Si-Hing.
- Get up, come on.
- Danny.
What now, Tigers?
Where's your
Danny Eight Hands at?
More like Danny No Hands!
- Whoa!
- Yo-ho!
Oops. Spoke too soon.
Let's go, Danny.
- Come on.
- Let's go, Danny!
Okay.
Let's go, Danny.
Let's go, Danny.
That ain't nothing!
Go to work!
You ain't got nothing, baby.
You ain't got nothing!
Oh, oh.
Ow!
Hey, wait. Hold on,
wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh.
That old man broken, yo!
Yeah, go!
Oh, shit, oh shit!
Look at that, oh, my goodness,
yeah, yeah.
Let's go, that's right,
that's right.
How'd that taste, old man?
Yeah, yeah. Come on,
let's... let's go.
- Good night, bitch.
- Come on, let's go get him.
- Okay, hold, hold him.
- I got him.
Okay, okay, okay.
- Relax, relax, relax.
- What... what happened?
Okay, come on, come on.
Wait, why are they
laughing at us?
Okay, what are they
gonna do? Ouch.
Okay, come on, Hing.
Get him.
Oh, yeah, yeah,
knocked your teeth out.
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
Oh.
Keep laughing, keep laughing.
Ah!
Get up! Fu, get up!
Oh, shit!
Whoa. Okay, Hing, Hing!
This is what happens
when you play with grown men!
Hing, you got him already.
Whoa!
- No, wait a minute.
- Hing, Hing, Hing.
- Hey, hey, Hing...
- Take out the trash!
You can't do that,
that's not kung fu!
Honor, Hing! Ho...
- C'mon, Fu!
- Tie game! Yeah!
C'mon, Fu!
That's what you get!
- That's my man.
- No, I'm good, I'm good.
- I'm good.
- All right.
- Shit's foul, man.
- We got this.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
What's wrong, you scared?
Um, I forgot the salute.
- What?
- What do you mean you forgot?
I don't quite remember
exactly what to do.
- But, uh...
- Forget it.
Okay.
Oh-hohoho, it's close one, eh?
Come on.
Oh, okay.
Ooh!
- Yes, sir!
- That's what's up!
- Come on, Ah Jim.
- Get up, get up!
- Boi, come on.
- Can't even get up.
Meow. Let's go.
Come on, has-been.
Yeah, what's up?
Come on, old man.
- I dare you!
- Paper Tiger, what's up?
Let's go!
Get up, yo, get up!
- Get up!
- Come on, get up!
I got you!
- Come on, get up!
- All day, baby!
- All day!
- Out, he's out, get off!
Out, he's out already, he's out!
Yeah, that's my nigga.
What?
Three Tigers,
still undefeated, baby.
Yes, sir!
Man, that was fun.
Hold him up.
Really?
Now, honor your word.
What was your relationship
with Sifu Cheung?
I asked him once
if he'd teach us.
What'd he say?
He wasn't having it.
He swore he'd never teach anyone
anything anymore.
He was always screaming
about ungrateful disciples.
He slammed a butcher knife
onto the block and broke it.
Sifu was always good to me.
We'd never do anything
to hurt him.
Delete all the photos
you took at the funeral.
All of it.
I don't want anyone
getting the wrong idea.
We might be a disgrace,
but Sifu
had only three disciples.
Hey, yo, man, sorry,
I called you nig...
the N-word.
I found it.
Right behind
your gonorrhea pills.
Oh.
Is it still good?
- Yeah, it's good.
- Oh, man.
The longer the Jow ferments,
the better.
Rub me down then, nurse.
My god, you still believe
in that stuff?
Mm.
I'll be good to go.
Aah, in the morning.
Yeah, well, I'm good to go now.
Somebody had to carry the team.
You mean we had to
- carry the team.
- Okay.
I'll drink to that.
I bet you Carter knew
the whole time
those kids were a bust.
We should get to Sifu Wong's
early tomorrow,
see if he's heard anything new.
We would have killed those kids
in our prime.
It's weird.
It's like I could feel
what I needed to do.
Where to move, but like...
my body wouldn't listen.
Getting old, my man.
Body's slowing down.
Sifu never slowed down.
Sifu's not everybody.
None of us
could touch him, ever.
Well, that's 'cause
Sifu was fast.
I wasn't fast, I was first.
- Same thing.
- Same thing, right?
No.
You remember doing meditations?
When I had it just right,
I was the most relaxed
I'd ever been.
I could feel
the color in the grass.
It was intense.
So anytime we went to beimo
when I had my breathing down
just right,
I could get the world
to slow down.
I, I mean, I could feel
the other guy's muscles
tensing up long before
he even would try to punch.
That's how I would
always hit first.
I knew what the other guy
was going to do
before he even thought of it.
What?
No, no, there's...
there's something to that.
It's like when I fell off
the scaffold.
I mean it was only
ten feet high, but...
it seemed like
it was the longest time before
I actually hit the ground.
It was a trip.
Think you could have pulled that
on Sifu?
Oh, jeez.
You know, if you would have
came with us to Japan,
maybe you could have talked
some sense into Dai Si-Hing.
I couldn't leave Sifu alone
like that.
Teacher's pet, huh?
We were all equally his sons.
No, no, you were definitely
his favorites.
Dai Si-Hing,
he inherits the clan.
You? You learned how to heal.
What do I get?
You get to eat the chicken.
I'mma forget that.
I'mma forget that you said that.
What?
Did he teach you poison fingers?
Come on, man.
"You want to learn
poison finger, you work hard...
- for 20 more years!"
- "For 20 more years!"
Yeah.
No.
After you two left,
old man lost his heart
for fighting.
So all we did was medicine.
Do you think the poison fingers
is real?
Every good Gung Fu man
keeps a secret.
Imagine if we all stayed...
cooped up in that garage...
With the old man sitting over
in the corner and smoking,
watching horse racing.
When we gather up all the kids
in the neighborhood and teach...
for free.
Is that so bad?
Well, you gotta eat.
You gotta pay rent.
Yeah.
When the old folks in Chinatown
couldn't afford treatment,
Sifu would offer to do
free clinics for them
on the weekends.
Because it was
"honorable and righteous".
Yeah, "righteous".
Guess who he expected
to come out to work
for free, too?
Of course.
Man, I'll be honest.
I mean I was doing
hotel security back then,
I mean I was getting paid,
it's good money.
So taking a day off from work
for a bunch of senior citizens
that can only repay you
with flowers and vegetables,
I mean that's nice,
but you know.
That day that Sifu needed me,
I didn't say anything to him.
I'd just go to my hotel job.
Funny thing is,
he doesn't call me.
He doesn't come looking for me.
A week rolls by,
I still don't hear from him.
So now I don't know
what to expect.
I mean, is he mad? Depressed?
He already lost you two, right?
But...
I never got up the courage...
to show my face
and just man up
and say I'm sorry.
Now, Sifu dies all alone
in a goddam alley.
Can't put that
all on yourself, man.
Gung Fu means
nothing without your word.
I mean if we promise
to do something...
we better do it, right?
Shit.
Shit.
Shit!
Yeah, let's go.
Ah, shit. Oh, shit.
Ah!
The Three Tigers of Sifu Cheung
finally back together.
Is Sifu Wong in?
Oh, he just stepped out
for a walk.
Should be back soon though.
You're more than welcome
to come in.
Have some tea while you wait?
Tea?
You won't wanna fight
or nothing, huh?
No.
Danny Four Feet.
Anybody smell Rogaine?
I remember
picking these leaves
from the Tian Shan
mountain range.
Plucked 'em from the top.
Heard about yesterday.
Tough times
for Danny Eight Hands.
How did you hear about that?
Nobody gossips like the Chinese.
Oh, no, no, it's online.
Yeah, the kids put up
a play-by-play and everything.
You're internet famous.
Son of a bitch.
Oh, forgot to like it.
Yeah, but what do you expect
these days?
Nobody cares about
the code of beimo anymore.
Used to be about respect.
You'd fight,
and no matter who won...
nobody talked about it
afterward.
Carter, those kids had no idea
how Sifu died.
Well, it was worth a shot,
right?
Actually, for you, more like
five straight shots to the head.
Definitely worth it.
So you knew it was
a dead end, huh? You set us up.
No, I didn't know
what they knew.
Just thought it'd be
a better bet for them
to face off against you,
the great Three Tigers.
Well, the old you.
Then again the now you
is the old you.
Or is it the lesser you?
Anything else you figured out?
- I got a couple of ideas.
- And?
So sad.
A toast!
To the once great
Danny Eight Hands.
- I...
- What are you doing?
- I didn't know he'll say that.
- Put it down.
Time sure catches up
to some people.
And it doesn't change a thing
for others.
I think I might have changed
just a little bit.
Not like you.
At least it's natural.
We'll look for Sifu Wong
when he gets back.
You want a theory?
- Okay, here we go.
- No, no, not really.
How about your Sifu took on
another disciple?
We're his only sworn disciples.
I was with him last.
Yeah, 15 years ago?
Plenty of time
to raise somebody new.
Who is it then?
- Beimo?
- There it is.
There it is.
What?
When the hands cross,
all will be revealed.
Best of three.
Hell, make it easy.
Three matches, but only one
of you has to beat me.
When'd you get so cocky, man?
I like it.
What do you say,
Dai Si-Hing?
What if we lose?
Can you just say it in English?
I mean, just say it
in English, man.
Because we can't understand.
The fiercest tigers...
can never share
the same mountain.
You pick yourself up
off the floor
and you get the hell
out of my school.
All right.
Come on, Ah Jim, you're first.
Make Sifu proud.
Yeah, yeah.
Man, I hope you brought
your ground game.
Otherwise, I'm putting you
to sleep.
Oh, are you gonna use
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu on me?
Forgot your Gung Fu already?
Dragon!
Snake!
Oh, my god.
Tiger!
Cock!
Crane.
This is like what?
You serious?
Okay.
Oh, come on, Jim.
You think you're smart, huh?
You wanna dance with me?
Did he hit me?
No, it's just a glance, man.
- It's fine...
- You got this...
It's fine.
Oh.
All right.
Uh-huh. Come on!
Uh-huh.
Ooh!
- Get up, come on, get up!
- Come on, Jim, get up.
- Let's do it.
- That ain't nothing.
Panther!
Oh!
Woo!
Oh!
Come on.
Come on. Okay, yeah.
Oh, Grandmaster Chan?
We did it.
We did it!
Ooh!
One down.
Two to go.
It's not fair, Carter.
You're cheating
with all that baby oil.
He just beat our best guy.
Oh, no offense.
All right.
What about a...
handicap for your handicap?
Use any weapon you want.
First blood?
Even a pin prick.
Fine. But you're the prick.
- No, you're the prick.
- I'm the pin, you're the prick.
No, you're the prick.
And I'm pinning you
with my prick...
with your prick.
Ew.
Just pick a weapon!
Oh.
Wha...
Not the hair, not the hair!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
Bald eagle.
That's it.
- He's doing his breathing.
- Yeah.
That's it, Dai Si-Hing,
nice and easy.
Yes, oh, yeah!
Yes!
Yes, Danny!
Okay, okay, careful!
Oh, no, no, no.
Come on.
Aah!
Come on, come on.
Wait, Carter!
Did I win?
Carter.
What, Sifu?
We're just playing around.
I was only going half power.
You are not that strong.
I am that strong.
Sifu Wong?
Did our Sifu
take in a new disciple?
No, never.
Then why is Carter going on
about another disciple?
Carter!
Last winter,
I received a challenge letter.
Wanted to fight me here
at the school.
He'd already been around
to the other masters and...
he'd beaten them all bad.
Did you win?
You got your butt kicked,
didn't you?
I didn't lose!
I didn't win either.
When he was on his way here,
I locked up the school,
turned out the lights.
Stayed up here until he left.
Your Sifu came over
to personally apologize.
Said his disciple was
totally out of control.
He actually said that,
"his disciple"?
Where can we find this guy?
Try the Dungeon.
His type might hang out there.
The Dungeon?
- You know this?
- Oh, yeah.
They say it's a mob front.
Bunch of journeymen who do
enforcer work on the side.
This guy turned his back
on your Sifu,
got mixed up with the Triads.
Sifu Cheung swore he would
take back his Gung Fu.
You're saying they fought?
How'd Sifu lose?
Oh, come on.
Oh!
My head's killing me.
Could be.
You did get knocked out twice
in one day.
All that blood pressure
squeezing your brain
against your skull.
It's what killed Bruce Lee.
Oh, there you go.
Oh.
- Mm-mm.
- Trust me, it works.
Is that what I think it is?
Oh.
Really?
The holy grail.
Yes!
Why are we here?
Oh, Carter always loses.
This is when you put it on him.
You dismantled him this time,
I remember this.
I'm not gonna take
my jacket off this time. Watch.
Okay, Dai Si-Hing?
Oh, he's mad, oh!
I still can't believe
he just waxed all our asses.
Oh!
Come on, open it.
God, God, God.
What does it say?
I'm in.
You're going to Japan?
We're going to Japan!
We're gonna be rich!
Japan, Japan, Japan!
Danny?
How are you gonna tell Sifu?
Oh, what is that?
Oh, yum.
- Chicken!
- Oh, damn.
- Oh, yeah!
- We were always mealing, man.
Sifu's cooking?
What are you guys eating?
Careful, Hing.
You're gonna get fat.
He's gonna get so fat.
That's nasty.
Oh.
Hey, guys, wait for Sifu!
- Sifu!
- See, man, I told you.
You always got
the best piece of chicken.
It's true!
Oh, thank you, Sifu.
I'm going to slow down,
calm down...
Oh! Oh.
Okay, go ahead, go ahead
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What? Ah, too slow!
Master your chopsticks, yes.
Okay, now, before we start.
Happy birthday, Jim.
Thank you, Sifu.
Happy birthday, Jim.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.
But this is
all for me, right, Sifu?
You can't eat all that.
You're not sharing?
- Not "I", it's "We".
- We. We!
- It's for us!
- We.
Really, stairs?
This ain't exactly
handicap-friendly.
Not that I'm handicapped.
You sure this is the spot?
Yeah, so keep your head
on a swivel, understand?
So, uh, how do we find
this guy, huh?
Easy. Find the one
that hits the hardest.
Find the one
that hits the hardest?
How?
Any luck?
Man, everybody here looks like
they can put the hurt on.
I mean, what are we looking for?
Not looking, listen.
What?
Ah Hing, talk to me.
That's... the sound.
Whoa.
Damn.
Let's go. Go, go!
That's too close, man.
- What are we doing?
- What are you doing?
Get ready to do
that U-turn, man.
Get ready to do the U-turn.
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go!
I know, I know, I know!
I know, hold on, hold on!
You're driving
like a soccer mom!
Danny!
I know, hold on, hold on.
What are you doing,
a 3-point turn?
U it, just U it!
Slow down, just slow down.
Why are you all up on him
like that?
- You are on his ass.
- Just don't look at him.
- Don't look at him?
- Just don't look.
Are you serious right now?
Oh.
Now speed up, speed up,
speed up.
You guys are exhausting.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
I'll be right back,
I promise, okay?
- Take your hood off.
- What, why?
- Take your hood off!
- What?
Today's special,
three courses,
$8.95, you want it?
- No, we don't want any food.
- Hey, table's not free.
Okay, then we'll have some tea.
If you don't eat,
tea's not free.
He's gonna pay.
Sorry about that...
Nice suit.
Oh, here he comes. Don't look,
don't look, just pretend.
Use your peripheral.
I got this.
Hey, where's the wine?
He... he did it,
I saw him, he did it.
I heard it. I...
- Where'd... where'd he go?
- Don't worry.
We got him right where
we want him.
- What do you mean?
- He kicked his bike over.
- You what?
- It weighs over 400 pounds!
He can't go anywhere,
now we can get him right now.
No, no, he's a hitman.
- He's a Gung Fu hitman.
- What?
Yeah, he didn't even
wash his hands. He...
- Somebody get help!
- Go call 911!
- Please, help!
- Somebody help!
Oh, I don't know.
Are you okay?
No way.
- Poison fingers.
- Help!
Well, that was a bright idea.
But he's right there.
- We just grab him!
- Yeah.
And do what?
There's no murder weapon.
The cops will say
it was a heart attack
just like with Sifu.
We can't just let him go.
Need a lift?
- Was this you?
- It depends.
Who taught you poison fingers?
The Three Tigers.
Took you guys long enough.
Dai Si-Hing...
just say the word.
You're Dai Si-Hing.
Holy shit.
That's impossible.
Only one can inherit the clan.
If all your sons died,
wouldn't you want another one?
Hey, Sifu told me
you hit him before you left.
Is that true?
What's he talking about?
Did that happen?
We all broke the old man.
Some more than others.
The fiercest tigers can
never share the same mountain.
Beimo.
Dammit!
You're gonna answer the phone?
Just one second,
I gotta get this.
It might be an emergency.
He just called beimo,
man, come on.
- Caryn?
- Danny,
did you get my texts?
Just tell her
you'll call her back.
I need you to do me
a big, big favor.
I'm stuck at work and it...
it's not ending anytime soon.
Can you pick Ed up
from school today?
Ah...
I could just pick him up
at your place later, say 8:00?
You know what, I'm sorry,
I can't right now.
Now is not a good time.
- Let's not do this.
- Hey!
I need you to step...
He killed Sifu,
what the hell we waiting for?
If we go at it here,
we're gonna have to fight off
the cops, too.
Holy shit!
Ugh.
Chinatown pier, 10:00.
This is such bullshit.
What are we doing?
So what, we just don't show up?
He'll think we chickened out,
but he'll move on.
Like Carter.
Guys like this just want
their ego stroked.
This prick is murdering people
using our Gung Fu.
When'd you hit the old man?
It was stupid. I...
- I just got lucky.
- There's no lucky with Sifu.
When I told him
about going to Japan.
He wasn't having it.
He said a Gung Fu man
should never trade
in his honor for money.
And I got mad.
I said something smart,
he called me a disgrace.
It got heated and I just...
I fired on him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.
You... you told me
he gave us his blessing!
I would have never gone with you
if it was like that.
Never.
You never looked back either.
- What?
- You can make it up now.
We gotta take ourGung Fu back.
Dude knows the death touch, man.
Not even Sifu
could even stop him.
But at least Sifu tried.
Look, I got a kid
that needs me, alive.
Huh! Give me a break, man.
You ain't winning
no father of the year awards.
Ah Jim?
First rule.
Never get in a ring unless
there's a chance you can win.
No one here can, so...
I don't believe this.
Sifu taught us Gung Fu...
so that we can become
good righteous men.
Out there
is a very, very bad man.
Now we all swore together
that we would defend the weak.
Your Gung Fu don't mean nothing
without your word.
Right?
Dai Si-Hing, my ass.
Ah Hing, let me take you home.
Ah Hing.
- Come on!
- Come on, grind...
Fight, yeah!
- Get him, get him!
- Hey!
Hey, stop!
Hey, just get outta here!
Get... get outta here!
You all right?
Get outta here!
Whoa, okay, okay, you're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.
Stand up, stand up.
Let me see.
Let me see your face.
Oh, it's okay.
Let me get your backpack.
You all right?
And who were those kids?
Next time, don't get in a fight
with a future linebacker, okay?
That guy was 12?
Jeez.
You're lucky it's not broken.
What happened to your face?
Oh, what, this?
I ran into a door.
You know how I tell you
not to run around the house?
Well, there's a good reason
for that.
So...
how do you think
we should tell your mother?
Hmm?
- Do we have to?
- Mm-hm.
Honor your mother.
But we told mom
we went to Magic Land.
Well, this is not the same
as Magic Land.
And we didn't tell her
'cause it would hurt her.
- That's what you said, right?
- No, that's not it.
So I wouldn't get in trouble
and I could see you again?
That... that...
This is completely different.
Besides, that's not what
I was trying to...
Okay.
Buddy, we have to tell
your mother about this,
all right?
- Is it ever okay to fight?
- No.
And if it happens to you...
you gotta go find a teacher.
What if there is no teacher?
Then you walk away.
What if he hits your friend?
Then you both have to walk away.
But he...
Doesn't stop,
calls your friend a faggot,
and punches him every day.
Well, that sounds like something
they need to settle
between themselves
as grown children.
You said I couldn't learn
any Gung Fu.
I asked you
and you wouldn't teach me.
I can't just let them hurt
my friend like that, right, Dad?
I'm Hing, second disciple
of Sifu Cheung.
Beimo.
Hiya!
Hiya!
Hiya, hiya!
Up on this,
up on the fist, good.
Deeper stance.
Good, roll the thumb over,
tighter fist, good.
Oh, my god,
what happened to you?
Uh, door, wall, something.
Oh, hang on, hang on, buddy.
Don't we have something
to tell your mother?
Always walk away, Ed.
I don't care who
or what started it.
Ellsworth is one of the
best schools in the state.
Your dad and I worked very hard
to get you there.
We cannot let this ruin
your future.
No, wait.
I don't think we should be
that hard on him.
I mean, he could have lied
to you about it, but he didn't.
The most important thing
is that he told you the truth.
Is that so?
Yeah, I mean,
he's learning self-respect.
You're nothing
without your word.
You're nothing
without your word?
So, um, what did you and Ed
do last weekend?
Well, he said that you
took him to Magic Land.
You know, like you said
and... and promised to do.
Yeah, yeah. We, we...
We headed out there
as soon as I picked him up
and, you know,
we went to grab a few burgers
for the road
and we just, uh...
We, uh...
I had to take care
of something at work.
It was a big deadline and, uh...
we didn't make it to Magic Land.
Then why would Ed say
that you did?
Because I made him promise
to tell you.
Ed, I'm...
That was very selfish of me.
It's wrong to lie to your mother
and I...
I shouldn't have made you
do it for me.
Okay, Ed, get yourself to bed.
We'll talk about
your punishment tomorrow.
For defending his friend?
No, he doesn't deserve
to be punished.
It's late.
Yeah, she's right, it's late.
Come on, give me a hug.
Stop wasting time, go.
Boy, when you have
the upper hand,
you really swing, don't you?
Does everything have to be
a fight with you?
It's certainly feeling that way.
Ah Hing?
Carter, what are you doing?
What?
That motherfucker.
That guy knew what he was doing.
"Number one before number two."
See, you're number one
and number...
Yeah, I got that.
Please take care of Ah Hing.
Danny, I, uh...
Carter, unless you have
the antidote for poison fingers,
I don't wanna hear
any more fortune cookies.
When a man's virtue
exceeds his talent...
he becomes the superior man.
I swear to always honor
my Sifu...
- Loyal to my brothers
- Loyal to my brothers
- and to defend the weak.
- and to defend the weak.
- This I promise as a disciple
- This I promise as a disciple
- to the very day I die.
- to the very day I die.
Danny,
do you know what time it is?
Where's Ed?
I wanna talk to him.
He's sleeping.
What do you think he's doing?
You never let him say
goodnight to me,
so I wanna say goodnight to him.
Are you drunk?
I screwed up, Caryn.
I was fooling myself.
I thought maybe if we did any
less than 50/50 with Ed that...
that it meant that
I wasn't being a good dad.
Like I wasn't holding up my end
of the bargain.
Look, I just...
I wanted to keep up with you.
But the truth is,
you're much better
at being a mom...
and a father.
Whatever custody you think
is best,
if it's 20/80 or...
Or full custody.
I'll sign it.
All I ask is that I get to say
goodnight to my son tonight.
Two minutes tonight,
tomorrow we talk.
Ed? Hey, buddy!
How you doing?
Good.
I just wanted to call
to let you know...
first...
...goodnight.
And if I could give you
a hug right now,
I would give you
the biggest hug.
And, uh, what I wanted
to say was that
I'm really proud of you, Ed.
I'm so glad that you stood up
for your friend.
That takes real guts.
And that it's okay.
If there's no other way out.
If you have to fight,
that's the right thing to do,
but don't go looking
for it, okay?
You understand?
Because if you go looking
for a fight,
that makes you the bully.
I want you to hold up your hand.
Okay?
Now I want you to curl
the very tips of your fingers
and squeeze down
so that your fingertips
are digging into your palm.
Squeeze really hard.
Now put your thumb down
over your fingers.
No sticking out, okay?
You can't have your thumb
sticking out or you'll break it.
Now point it to the light
and look through your hand
like it's a telescope.
Can you see through it?
Any light coming through
your fingers?
- Yeah.
- All right.
That means you're not
squeezing hard enough, son.
You gotta squeeze really hard
so that there's no more light
coming through the holes.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
Okay, that's how
you make a fist.
From now on, if anyone ever lays
a hand on you,
touches your mother
or anyone you love,
son, I want you to squeeze
as hard as you can.
And you smash that fist
right in their face.
I'm the senior disciple
of Sifu Cheung.
Beimo.
Best of three rounds.
Three minutes each.
First round, you attack.
Second round, I attack.
Knockout wins it all.
Suppose you make it
to the third round?
If you make it
to the third round?
Free fight.
Winner throws the loser
off the roof.
If I win... you both go.
- Fine.
- What?
Um, wait a minute.
I'm not gonna let him
throw us off, that's crazy!
Let me land first
and I'll cushion your fall.
Okay, Danny Eight Hands.
Listen,
round one's gotta be all you.
Because if we're being honest,
it's the only chance
you got to hurt him,
so you gotta hit him
with bad intentions.
Right.
Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right,
Ba-ba! Start in on him!
Yeah, you... you gotta kill him
before he kills you.
Before he kills us.
Us.
You got this.
You keep time.
You trust me?
All family here.
Y'all ready?
Go!
I... I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.
- Uh, it's burning!
- Dude, what ya doing?
What's the time?
Uh, man, you're killing it, bro!
Doing great!
Just go! Go!
Danny.
Go, hurry!
Shit.
Oh!
Oh-hohoho!
What are you doing again?
You still got two minutes.
Danny!
- Danny!
- Okay.
Keep fighting, dammit.
This is your only chance.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Let's go, get up!
- Get up!
- Take... take your time, man.
Time, time, time!
One minute break.
Whose round was that?
He hit me, right?
- You can have it.
- Uh!
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
I felt something crack.
Even if I get
to the third round,
I can't do anything to him.
I want you to stop worrying
about that. I need you to focus.
Focus on this second round
'cause he's gonna bring it
to you now.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
We're here now, right?
I can't beat him.
- I can't beat him.
- Hey!
If you believe
you're gonna lose,
then you've already lost.
I need you to believe
in yourself, okay?
I need you to believe
you can beat him.
Now say it.
- I believe I can beat him.
- No,
say it like you mean it, Danny.
- I believe I can beat him.
- Come on.
I believe I can beat him.
- Say it! Come on, Danny! Yes.
- I believe! I could beat him.
- I believe I could beat him.
- Come on now!
- I believe...
- Let's go!
- I believe he's gonna kill me.
- Look at me.
I believe he's gonna stab me
with poison fingers!
Look at me.
I have something else.
I was gonna give it
to you later,
but I'm gonna give it
to you now.
They're performance enhancers,
it's gonna boost your power.
Boost your speed, you're gonna
be throwing bombs, son!
No, no!
There's no honor in that.
Do you wanna live
to see your son?
Not as a coward.
Fine.
It's placebo,
I was just playing.
I was just trying
to get you to believe.
What are they then?
Aspirin.
Oh, hell!
Give 'em to me.
- Come on!
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
- Let's go get him.
You got it.
Y'all ready?
Go!
Okay, nice, nice, nice. Nice!
Stay outside, stay outside!
Fight like a man,
come here, come on!
What are you doing? Coward!
Run!
Run, you coward, run!
Time, time, time!
That was my round.
All right, man. Whoo.
I could see him.
I could see him move.
I just need to breathe.
Oh.
I think he busted my ribs.
When's the aspirin
gonna kick in, man?
- You don't feel anything?
- No.
Nothing?
Everything I gave you?
All that was just sugar tablets.
Yeah, yeah,
we use it to trick fighters
into cutting weight.
But it worked
for a little while, right?
- Power of belief.
- Exactly.
Okay, focus.
What you did was good.
Look,
you're wearing him down.
You just gotta keep moving
this round, huh?
My legs are shot.
If you don't float,
he's gonna sting.
Don't punk out on me now,
Danny Eight Hands.
No more time limit!
Even Sifu
didn't make it this far.
Shut up and fight.
Oh, shit.
Did he get you?
You okay?
Oh.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, Danny Eight Hands!
The legend continues!
Easy.
Easy, Dai Si-Hing, you okay?
Did he get you?
So what do we do now?
What's that again?
The fiercest tigers can
never share the same mountain.
Keep your damn mountain.
911, what's your emergency?
Caller, I repeat,
what is your emergency?
Caller, if you're in danger
and can't speak
just stay on the line, okay?
We're attempting to trace
your call and send assistance.
Stay with me as long as you can.
So, if your guy's good
at stand-up,
you want to slip, catch.
Just like that.
Hmm.
It's bad.
Your circulation is bad.
What was your favorite ride?
- Mount Splash.
- Still Mount Splash?
Mm-hm.
Big smile. Ah!
Drive that thing.
- You Asian drivers...
- Yo, I got this, I got this.
You're late.
- Sorry about that.
- Sit down, man.
Hi, Uncle Hing, hi, Uncle Jim.
What's up, let me see the set.
Oh, let me feel the power. Bao!
Ooh! You're working out, I see.
That's nice,
yeah, Ah Hing?
I'll get a shaomai
and a chashao.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?
Huh? Just go, go, go get out.
Don't you know who they are?
They're the Three Tigers!
If you guys are looking for, uh,
you know, a fourth Tiger,
I take karate.
Let me know, all right?
Uh, enjoy the food,
it's on the house.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
- Yeah, enjoy.
Okay. Okay. I'll be out front.
Three Tigers and the Karate Kid?
Four?
How does that feel
to know your daddy is famous?
- Ready?
- Yep.
Hands up, hands up. Punch, hoo!
That way, hoo, huh, hoo, two.
One, two.
Foot up.
Whoa.
Yeah, all right.
Ah, mmm!
Let's do it again!
