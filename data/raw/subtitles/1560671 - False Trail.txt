OK. come on! Gather round!
Listen up!
Group one. with Gsten in charge.
You start from the bog and head east
over to the chain
of hunting towers here.
Sune and group 2. you start here
by the power line and head north.
Folke. no beating for the hunt today.
You've got dodgy knees. right?
You'll have to be on the tower
with group 6 and Rolle.
Group 7. with Veikko...
you take the tower up here.
And then si>< men. from here to here.
Excuse me...
Torste-n's crew. right.
You wanted to start in the tower
up here by the flank. didn't you.
We'll do them in order so Peter and I
get the last watch in the clearing.
OK. Right. let's get cracking!
FALSE TRAIL
- So what did you call me out for?
- We have to stop the hunt.
- What. now? Can't it wait a few hours?
- No. it can't.
Get back in the car.
So what the hell is it now?
Elin Ledin's car
has been found abandoned.
There-'s blood.
Hempo and Astrtim are already there.
We-'ve taken prints.
And there-'s blood in the boot.
- What's happened?
- You don't want to know. Go back.
We-'II have to call off the hunt.
I don't quite get it. Niklas.
Are you lying to me?
You really don't know where she is?
Jesus. you stalked her day and night!
- Not any more. You know that.
- How the hell can I be sure?
S/gn up for the search party here.
Re/we/nber to /ea I/e
your ,0/10/we numbers.
- One sec... l'm busy.
- l've got a match on the prints.
Torsten. a quick word...
You can let the lad go. We-'ve found
Jari Lippone-n's prints in the car.
No. Jari?
- Shouldn't we haul him in?
- No. l'll call the boys in Lulea.
And I want
Stockholm doing the questioning.
I know you'd love to nail this bastard.
This is why we-'re going to do boring
proper police work the whole way.
No personal vendettas. So national CID
will send the best they have.
- What is it?
- l've got something for you. Up north.
The missing woman.
L've only had 5 days off duty
this month.
It's your old stomping ground.
It's miles away. l'm not going.
It's a disgrace to the whole force
that they've not sorted their problems.
That's as maybe. but I don't want
to work where I know people.
- L've got family there.
- Jari Lippone-n's not family is he?
No. but my nephe-w's stepfathe-r's a cop.
As long as you're unrelated to the girl
or Jari. you've got no argument.
My mind's made up.
You'll be back before the weekend.
Police! Police!
Police! Drop the knife! Drop the knife!
You fucking cunt!
She-'s in there.
I got that from Jari.
Don't you fucking touch it.
Really? And when did you get it?
Give it to me! lt's fucking mine!
Fucking Pig-
You bastards!
- Fuck!
- Drive!
Christ. Jari. Can't you just open your
gob so I can take these olamn samples.
You heard him. Open up!
Elinl Elinl
Torsten? This is Erik Béckstrfim
from national CID.
Erik Béckstrfim. Well l'll be damned.
- Hi.
- Shit. it's great to meet you.
This is Pete-r's uncle.
- Your Peter?
- Yes.
- So Erik. what's the plan?
- I want to meet Lipponen ASAP.
Hello. Jari. l'm Erik Béokstrom
from national CID in Stockholm.
Would you mind
if I asked you some questions?
It's like this...
We've found Elin Ledin's car
abandoned at the end of a track.
In and around the car
we-'ve found traces of her blood.
And we-'ve found your fingerprints.
Then we also have this bag.
Elin had it when she disappeared.
We found it in your house.
Can you go and get me an ashtray?
- You shouldn't be alone with that.
- We-'II be just fine. Won't we?
Now get me that ashtray.
You've no idea
what's going on here. have you?
The cops up here have been fucking
with me and Esa for 10 years.
They blame everything on us.
I know nothing about that.
- But then you can speak to me.
- You cops help each other.
I know no one and l'm not here to help
anyone. l'm here to get to the facts.
Do you smoke?
Now tell me what happened.
I saw that fucking car there unlocked.
Maybe I took the bag.
And then I drove away.
There were valuables in the car.
Why not take them too?
Don't you believe me?
- I have a witness.
- Your brother. Was Esa there too?
No. A soldier or hunter or something.
He came in camouflage from the forest.
He saw me and I split.
In camouflage?
So where did you see him?
- I saw him in the rear-view mirror.
- You didn't see who it was?
Could you show me?
I hope you olioln't take offence.
I could tell he-'s not that fond of you.
No...
Jari. here-'s where the car was when we
found it. Show us exactly what you did.
I got in.
And then I saw the bag on the floor.
I picked it up...and that's
when I saw him in the mirror.
He came from the forest.
Get out of the car. Jari.
Come. You say you saw someone
come out of the forest.
So how did he get over the fence?
I was on a bender.
Been pissed for three days.
Isn't it time you told us
what really happened?
Fuck this. l've told you everything.
- Bullshit! You're lying.
- l'm not fucking lying.
Hi. baby.
No. l'll be a bit late.
Yes. he is... l'll ask him.
Love you. bye.
That was Karin. She wants to meet you.
So does Peter. When I told him
his uncle was coming up. he...
Your brothe-r's boy's here?
Shit. you're almost family.
- Shut it. Jari.
- You're the same as Torsten.
You're in my book now.
You. Torsten and your brothe-r's boy.
What does that mean?
Maybe the boy will have a car crash.
Break his neck. who knows?
It was there!
- Stop! 7'/1af's where her car was!
- Stop fucking around!
Torsten. stop the car!
Let go of me!
- Down on the ground!
- 7'/1af's where her carwasl
This was where it was!
7'/1af's where he came out.
- Shut up!
- This was where it fucking was!
What the fuck. it was there!
Now shut /f.'
If the oar was here he ooulol've seen
someone coming out of the forest.
Torstenl Over here.
- Is it Elin's?
- Yes.
- Hi.
- There-'s an impression of a body here.
There's a lot of blood.
She lay here for a while.
So if she'd been shot.
the shot must've come from over there?
She runs from the car into the forest.
the gunman follows her and fires.
Meanwhile Jari finds the car.
The gunman returns. Jari runs off.
What do you think?
Or Jari sees her by the car. mugs her.
she runs off. he follows and kills her.
Why would he show us the spot then?
We've found so/net/1/ng.'
Probably a bullet from a hunting rifle.
Send it off to the lab
for analysis at once.
Erik. what you said back there.
If people start thinking we-'re not sure
Jari's guilty. they might turn against us.
You know as well as I do
that we need their help.
Anol you know that it's wrong to pin
your suspicions on a killer too early.
- We know Jari was in the car. Erik.
- And so you ditch everything else.
You do a sloppy search of Elin's flat.
question her boyfriend for 5 minutes...
If you'd been living here as long as us.
you'd know there-'s a lot to weigh up.
Torsten was attacked on my first week
here while out jogging. 7 stab wounds.
His attacker was masked.
but Torsten recognised his clothes.
I had to close the case
as I had no proof.
But we all knew it was Jari.
Erik. listen. We can discuss
all the other scenarios between us.
But in public Jari did it. No one else.
- Johanna here.
- Hello you.
- / heard you'd been ex//ed.'
- My old home ground. I need your help.
- How many days?
- A week. max.
/ can'! be away from /10/we for a Week.
There-'s a flight first thing tomorrow.
We-'ve no lab. so bring what you need.
We '// nel/er give up hope.
Notorious thug arrested
Thanks.
- Erik?
- Hi.
I was wondering if you could sit
with us. Karin wants to meet you.
Thanks but l'm just off.
l've got a long olay tomorrow.
L've had the bullet identified.
A Norma. calibre 30.
Shit.
The-y've found a rifle at Jari's place.
See you tomorrow. We-'II see if
the bullet and his rifle match up.
Peter and his band are going to olo
a few songs. Can't you stay and listen?
Him up there. the singer.
Hi. I just wanted to say hello.
l'm Karin. Pete-r's mum.
Hi. Erik.
I couldn't believe it when Torsten
said you were coming up and...
It was nice meeting you.
You're not going. are you?
The-y're on in a minute.
He-'s here to work. baby.
Another time.
Erik. why not come over
for dinner then. Is Friday OK?
Friday's fine.
Many of you know Elin.
And I know you're hoping
she-'II return.
So we thought we-'ol open
with a song that I know Elin likes.
Hello. there!
- Sleep in?
- Already here. already at work.
Johanna Lager.
a colleague from Stockholm.
- Mats Sundelin. the gov'nor here.
- Welcome.
L've tested Lippone-n's rifle.
The bullet is of the same calibre
as the rifle you found at Lipponen's.
But it's not the same gun. and you knew
that. Why am I here. to hold your hand?
No. we're going to check every rifle
that's shown up in the whole forest.
- How many?
- It could be hundreds.
No way! Is hunting so popular here?
How the /1e// can you doubt /f?
/'I/e seen /f W/f/1 my own eyes.'
Erik. good to see you.
This is Patrik Hallin. prosecutor.
- Hi. Patrik.
- Erik Béckstrfim.
Patrik's unsure if we can hold Jari
on what we-'ve got.
We-'ve got nothing to warrant
a detention order.
No. it was Elin's blood on the bullet.
but it didn't match the rifle we found.
- Jari knows the game.
- He dumped the gun. as he did before.
We-'ve no body. no weapon.
Just the spot where the body lay.
And Jari's prints. In Elin's car.
And blood.
There was no blood on Jari. Nothing.
Erik has to do his job. and he can't
if you let that nutter loose again!
Put your personal vendetta aside
and see it from a purely forensic angle.
See? What the hell
is he going on about?
I don't get you.
He-'s saying you're prejudiced.
So my experiences of Jari
count for nothing?
No. nothing.
I just don't want that git to screw up.
like he did when Jari tried to kill me.
If you'd done your job he'd be locked
up and none of this would've happened.
So what do you suggest we do?
Draw up a list of every hunter
who was in the area.
Where they were
and who they were with.
That means me and Torsten. you know.
There were 50 of us on our hunt.
There were also Arne Lundstr6m's boys.
They were a few miles...
We have a bullet.
We have to check every gun here of
the same calibre. You should know that.
How can I look people in the eye
if l'm to seize their weapons
and toss accusations around?
If you oan't look people in the eye and
olo your job. maybe you should quit.
With pleasure. if you're going
to take that fucking attitude.
Erik...
- I wasn't lying.
- Get yourself home now.
- Astrtim. Got hold of Torsten yet?
- He-'s not answering.
People are going crazy out there.
OK. listen up everyone! Hey! Listen!
This is Erik Béckstrfim
and Johanna Lager from the CID.
- They're helping with the rifle tests.
- When will we get them back?
As soon as we-'re done. Fill out your
forms and hand in your guns in turn
and we-'II get things done quickly.
The faster you do as we say.
the sooner you'll get your rifles back.
Make way! Silence!
Is there a problem?
We-'re doing this for Elin and Folke.
Can you oblige?
- Yes...
- Good. Then let's get on with it.
Up where Hempo is.
Hold this.
Get a move on.
Right. you hand your guns in to us...
...l'll start with my own gun...
And then we take the cartridge
and place it in an evidence bag...
...with the bullet. We then write
the gun's serial number on the bag...
- ...that we then...
- Excuse me!
Here. So you can check
if l've shot my own daughter!
Thanks. They listen to you.
I heard you thought there were holes
in that interview with Niklas.
- He should have more to tell.
- So let's go and talk to him.
- Right now?
- Get in.
- L've already told you.
- Then do so again. This is Erik. CID.
- Haven't you arrested Jari?
- Yes. but we've released him.
- Well. I was helping a mate to move...
- I know. Relax. Niklas.
You were stalking her.
She got tired of it and had the police
issue a restraining order on 17 March.
You breached it on the 18th. 24th and
26th March. 12th April and 29th April.
No one round here knows more about
Elin's life in recent months than you.
L'm convinced you've seen something
that could help our inquiry.
Had she met someone else?
lsn't that why you were stalking her?
- Amongst other reasons.
- So why stop?
You stalk her night and day until
15th June and then suddenly nothing.
Not a single report from Elin.
Something must have happened. eh?
Answer him. Niklas.
She admitted it.
She admitted having met someone.
I don't know who it was.
but she admitted it.
I guess it's what I needed to hear.
- Excellent fish.
- Pete-r's the one who caught them.
Come on. Dad. we bought them.
- Do you fish?
- I used to. ages ago.
No more for me thanks. l'm driving.
- I can drive you.
- No you won't. You're sleeping here.
Just a little one. lt's only 15 minutes
to the hotel. I know a short out.
- Cheers. then.
- Cheers.
I heard you perform the other night.
You were pretty good.
He takes after me.
But Dad was also good at singing...
according to Mum.
- That's right. he was.
- Yes.
Pete-r...get your guitar.
You can't go back on a deal. If Erik
comes. we-'II play. We agreed. right?
He writes good tunes.
It wasn't always that easy
raising Peter on my own.
It seems to me
Iike you've done a good job.
When I wrote to you.
he was really off the rails.
He and some friends
broke into the school.
Torsten was the one who arrested them.
- He doe-sn't want to hear this.
- lt's important to me.
Peter and Torsten sat in the car.
talking and talking. For an hour or so.
And when they got out.
Peter gave Torsten a hug.
You really reached him.
Why didn't you
ever reply to her letters?
Peter asks about Leif.
Now when you show up
it's hard to keep the truth from him.
Leif didn't know I was pregnant.
I was going to tell him.
but then he died...
But that's not what l've told Peter.
He thinks we were happy and that
his father died in an accident. A fire.
L've said it before and l'll say
it again: Tell the boy how it is.
The truth always comes out.
Sooner or later.
- So Niklas is lying?
- She-'d say anything to get rid of him.
No way was she together with him.
but in his world. he was with her.
You're a good interrogator. Erik.
but you don't trust your instincts.
I /mow that Jari killed Elin.
You need proof of that too.
Would someone kill for a handbag?
- Hi. baby.
- lt's freezing!
- Do you also know Elin?
- No. not at all...
You're not standing here talking shop
are you? That's not why you came!
- Come back in. l've got a fire going.
- Thanks. but I have to go.
That short cut - do I have to swim it?
Go left up there by the shed. walk
500 metres and then up to the right...
- ...and there's the main road.
- Thanks for a lovely evening.
Erik... can't you give Peter a ring?
Here-'s his number.
See you.
- Come on. let's go in.
- Good idea.
Elin used to go jogging down there
along the lit ski-track twice a week -
- and when she returned
and was getting into her car...
...a woman stepped up to her
and went for her.
She seemed really angry
and was screaming and flailing...
Elin shut the oar door
and drove off.
The woman stayed behind and when
she turned round. I saw that it was...
...Torsten's wife.
- Karin?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- I met her working at the care home.
- What did she say?
- It was too far away.
Just don't tell the cops here.
- Why not?
- Torsten will find out.
- And?
- You don't know what he-'s like.
The real reason I stopped following
Elin was that she told Torsten and...
Yes?
If he threatened you.
you must report it.
I have to live here. I never want
to meet that side of Torsten again.
You must promise me.
What l've said is between you and me.
Here she is: Karin Johansson.
Two convictions.
Two assaults. one serious.
She clearly has a tendency
to get violent when she's jealous.
- Were they recent?
- Six years ago and then nothing.
That's roughly when she met Torsten.
She says the same of Peter too.
Whds Peter?
Her son. She says that
Torsten sorted him out too.
Or. as with Niklas. no one wants aggro
with Torsten. so everyone keeps quiet.
- Breakfast at 8?
- No. let's have a lie in.
- Hi! Thanks for the dinner.
- Thanks.
How's it going? Chuck that in the back.
Good luck.
- Any sign of anything yet?
- No...
- You?
- No. Just the riverbed.
Me and my brother
used to do this a lot.
Boy. could your dad fish!
Almost as good as me!
He was better at hunting though.
- Do you hunt?
- Now and then.
- Were you out the other day?
- Yes. with Torsten.
So how does it work?
I know you sit on watch and all that...
but olo you keep tabs on each other?
We were together the whole time.
A big one! Keep the line taut!
- What have you got?
- A big bastard!
- Got the net?
- Yes! Where is he?
- Come to daddy...I
- Where is he?
Shit! It was this big!
And this fucking net! Shit!
Is that how you fish?
What was the point of all this?
When you can buy them
in the supermarket. eh?
What was it like growing up with Dad?
What do you mean?
- I mean. what did you do?
- Everything and anything.
Helped on the farm with
the animals. the hay. the forest...
- Was it hard work?
- Boring as hell!
So I moved to Stockholm
and became a cop.
But Dad stayed behind.
Yes.
You lived around here. right?
- Can't we go there?
- There-'s nothing to see.
- Please. we-'ve got time!
- I said no.
But l've heard other things.
That he was a...
...a murderer.
Whds told you that?
Is it true?
Yes.
So what happened?
No one...
No one has tolol me a bloody thing.
I know nothing. Erik.
No one tells me anything
and l've got no one to talk to.
I ask and ask
but no one tells me anything.
No one ever wants to talk about Leif.
Jari. you said that someone
came out of the forest. Who was it?
- No fucking idea.
- Think!
- How was it seeing Torsten again?
- Shut up. Irina. He was scared.
Torsten scared of you?
I don't think so!
Irina. please shut up.
He grabbed me between the legs.
Pressed his cock into me
and what did you do? Fuck all.
- Did he do that?
- She'd been drinking.
Did he do that? Answer me!
- Come here you fucking pig!
- Get out!
Torstenl Torstenl
- Get out. I said. Out!
- What are you going to do with that?
Get out. you bastard! Out!
L'm serious. Get out!
Get out. I said!
Shoot me.
Tell Torsten
to keep his hands of my wife!
Arvo Salminen told me Jari tried to
buy petrol at his garage with a card.
An hour or so
after Elin went missing.
Jari with a card?
It must've been Elin's.
Then Greta Féringer says she saw Jari
come from the old track before that.
But isn't that track barred?
Yes... but it's a damn good place
to dump a body. wouldn't you say?
Just a moment... Good work. Astrtim.
Hi. baby.
We-'II keep this in the family.
And what have you done with the rifle?
I locked it back in the cupboard.
Good.
- I tested the last rifles today.
- Get anything?
No. but Torsten came by and said
you were out fishing with Peter.
He mentioned that Peter
was your nephew.
What are you doing. Erik?
I don't think Torsten
was on his watch the whole time.
- Did Peter say that?
- No but he lied about it.
He-'s scared of him.
I recognise that look in his eye.
My dad beat us and we never knew
when the ne><t blow would come.
My brother worked in the forest one
year with three broken ribs. He was 16.
You get good at hiding the pain.
but it shows in your eyes.
Erik...
- You never mention your private life.
- There's nothing to mention.
Get out before you get too close
to your personal issues.
My personal issues are history.
This has nothing to do with them.
Peter is your nephew. Get people
up here from CID to question him.
No one's questioning Peter.
- Of course we have to question Peter.
- No.
- It would just alert Torsten.
- So what will you do?
L'm not getting Peter involved.
He-'s too scared to say anything.
The inquiry's ground to a halt
because you're targeting Torsten.
No. it's because
we-'ve no weapon or body.
It could be Karin. We know she
threatened Elin. Maybe she shot her.
- So who was the man Jari saw?
- We don't know.
Shit! We don't even know
what Elin was doing up there.
Found something?
No.
Good work. Astrtim. We-'II map out
every step that bastard took.
How's your boy?
Will he ever get to that soccer camp?
- Christ knows. he-'s such a lazy git!
- He needs a carrot.
- A carrot?
- That he can chuck at his coach!
Oh. so it's you!
What are you up to?
She must be out there somewhere.
You know the area. This must be
on your mind as much as mine.
It's a big forest.
L'm thinking of calling some backup
from Stockholm ne><t week.
Do that.
We need all the help we can get.
- Peter said you've never been hunting.
- No. I never got round to it.
L'm going out tomorrow morning
if you're curious.
I can pick you up.
- What time?
- Six. Is that too early?
OK then.
Peter said
you'd grilled him about the hunt.
I just wondered if someone
could have slipped away unnoticed.
- Why did you ask Peter that?
- He was there.
It was just an innocent question.
Listen...
Did you talk about his father too?
- That's between me and Peter.
- Like hell it is.
It affects me and Karin too.
I worked with some of your old
colleagues so I know what happened.
You were out to frame your own brother.
Family is sacred to me.
You never betray it.
What are you trying to say?
I love Peter. As if he were my own.
We have no secrets.
In future. if you want to know anything
you ask me. not a 16-year old boy.
OK.
How well did you know Elin?
You won't find this
in the files. Erik...
...but she wasn't so fussy
about who she had.
Especially when she was drinking.
which she-'d do a lot of.
And speed too.
We nicked her a couple of times.
- You had no more intimate contact?
- You mean did I fuck her?
Erik. l'm happily married.
I know which hole I can stick it in.
But you took a keen interest in the case
when she was being stalked.
L've known Folke and Elin for 20 years.
l've watched her grow up.
If some nutjob is stalking her.
threatening her. I sort it.
I realise Niklas
wants to get back at me.
But what I don't get is how
someone like you could fall for it.
It wasn't Niklas. It was my own theory.
See it?
- You take her.
- You do it.
You're a guest. You take her.
A deep breath. Erik...
Well. fuck me.
Out it comes!
Turn her over.
What's Llp'_7
Call up a search party.
You all right? Nothing broken?
Because things can easily get broken.
In crashes.
Know why it hurts so much?
Because there-'s too much talk. I don't
like people going behind my back.
Back already?
Did you have a go at Elin
down by the ski-track?
Witnesses saw you hit her.
- I know you were fucking her.
- l'll have none of that talk.
I know what I know.
But you hitting Elin is a fact. A fact
my colleagues will be asking about.
What the hell am I to say?
What will your answer be?
Hey! What will your answer be. Karin?
What will you say?
We-'II get through this too. you'll see.
But you've got to stop this.
The jealousy.
Otherwise we're both screwed.
She's been cut open and gutted.
- Jesus.
- Why gut someone?
- To stop the body rotting.
- Not this time.
This is a sexton beetle.
The eggs hatch after 5 days.
She was covered with them. But there
were still larvae in her abdomen.
So we can assume
she was cut open a few days later.
Ahsfrd/'h here. /'rh by the barr/er along
the track. You heed to C0/779. qu/ck/y.
Coming?
- What the hell is it?
- Come and look.
- What is it?
- There-'s loads of girls' things here.
- I fucking told you he'd been here.
- Good work. Astrtim.
- Now we can nail Jari.
- Too right!
We-'ve got a witness who saw him drive
off. plus the garage owne-r's testimony.
- Let's haul him in. Come on.
- Hey. hold your horses.
This doe-sn't prove he did it.
- How much proof olo you need?
- Let's wait until the forensic report.
Mats...
Go and bring him in. And not a word
about what we-'ve found up here.
- So where-'s your brother?
- He-'s not here.
- Another beer.
- Jari. you know the score.
Give me a fucking beer!
Anyone else think I should leave?
Well? Fucking cunts!
Cheers.
She-'s not coming back.
She's found some guy and
is lying somewhere getting fucked.
Cheers.
/'/11 ca///ng from Hunfeﬂs Comer.
Jar/'s up here...
Good. Bye.
Who did you call?
I saw you on the phone.
L'll cut your
fucking dick off first...
Cool it. Jari...
No.
Fucking hell.
Fuck off.
- He//0?
- Esa. I think I know who I saw.
- Oh. yes. That fucking pig.
- You mean Torsfen...?
It was you I saw in the forest.
Wait till I tell the Stockholmer.
You killed her.
you fucking bastard pig.
- L'll tell them.
- Put the knife down.
You think l'm going to keep
my mouth shut? l'll tell everyone.
Yeah. sure. I know exactly where it is.
We-'re on our way.
- Erik. Torste-n's got Jari in the car.
- Alone?
Jari's going to show him
where he hid the murder weapon.
- Step out. Jari.
- No.
Get out. I said.
Out. you bastard...
- What are you going to olo? Shoot me?
- You'll show me where the weapon is!
You don't understand?
What don't you understand?
What is it you don't understand?
So he ran onto the road
from out of nowhere?
- Were you here when it happened?
- No.
And you're certain you saw nothing...?
What the hell were you doing out here?
He was going to show me
where he-'d hidden the murder weapon.
It was meant to be somewhere here.
And then... I don't know.
he just ran right out.
He ran out in front of the timber truck
just as it came along?
Maybe he knew it was all over
when I told him we'd found Elin's body.
Why did you drive out here
alone with him?
They called me from Hunters.
said that Jari was causing trouble.
- I went to haul him in.
- So you came here alone with him?
- Shut it! Why drive out here alone?
- Just answer the question.
Damn it. Mats. he confessed in the car.
He was going to show me...
His amateur way of doing things
keeps throwing us off the path!
Better that he-'s dead
than we hear what he has to say.
What the fuck did you say?
What are you insinuating?
- You heard me.
- What the fuck are you implying?
Stop it! Calm down!
Knock it off!
Do you believe that? Do you really
think Jari would kill himself?
We can tie Jari to the scene.
We-'ve found a cigarette butt
with his saliva on.
And the hairs we found
in Elin's hand match Jari's.
A hundred vl//// be enough. Won'! /f?
See you fan/g/1!.'
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's time for me to leave.
- You've just missed Peter.
I know. It was you I wanted to talk to.
Peter has his music.
He told me he wanted
to make a go of it. And he should.
There are lots of good schools
near where I live.
I can help you get started...
- l've got work to olo...
- Look. take Peter and get out of here.
Come down to Stockholm.
I can help you find somewhere to live.
You just turn up when it suits you.
Where the hell were you when I wrote?
- You come here ordering me about...
- l've seen the bruises.
- Torsten's beating Peter.
- What bruises?
- Christ. you must have seen them!
- Look. I love Torsten.
He-'s always there for me.
I asked you for help with Peter.
years ago
and you made your decision
all too clear. Stand by it!
What kind of mother turns a blind eye
to the abuse of her son?
- Does he beat you too?
- Fuck you!
Folke wants you
to sing something at the funeral.
Jesus. how long does it take?
- Busy day?
- lt's the funeral. you know.
- Thanks.
- And are congratulations in order?
- L'm sorry?
- It had fallen into the lining.
Your secre-t's safe with me.
Here.
Phewl We thought you'ol got lost in
there amongst all the polythene bags!
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah.
- So you thought you'd take time out?
- He-'s played us.
He planted the body.
He knew that Jari'd been seen up here.
And then he takes me on a hunt.
That was no coincidence.
It's the same with Jari's hair
and the butt. He planted them.
And no way has the body been lying
here since the day Elin disappeared.
I mean. she'd been gutted.
An animal must've come and fed on her.
He'd kept her body somewhere else.
And then he placed it there.
- What do you reckon? You examined it!
- The case is closed.
Say l'm wrong. Say what the fuck
you like. Just don't say that.
The case isn't closed as long
as the killer is at large.
- And I know it was Torsten who did it.
- We tested his gun.
- He-'s set us up!
- Us? My job's done.
- L'm done with this.
- Then you can just fucking leave.
I didn't think you were the kind
to give up so easily.
I have a life outside work.
You should get one too.
- Why are you doing this?
- For Pete-r's sake.
I don't want the boy
brought up by a killer.
- L've got to find something.
- Find what?
You had your chance but you blew it.
Peter was Torste-n's weakest spot.
I told you to bring him in
for questioning like any other witness.
But it's too late.
The case is closed. Deal with it.
L've spent my life running away.
I abandoned my brother to our father.
So that the bastard
could do what he wanted to him.
I do not intend to do that again.
Go on. get out.
Erik...
- Torsten removed the DNA evidence.
- What do you mean?
Well. l've been thinking too.
I reckon Elin was pregnant.
He cut out her uterus to prevent us
from examining the foetus.
7'/vroug/1 the fa/r realms of ear!/1
We go singing to Paradise
Peter...
You sang beautifully.
I wanted you to have this. It might not
be your thing. but your olad loved it.
I remember
he liked to sing track number 8.
It was nice of you to come.
Goodbye.
Pia! Hi. We-'ve met.
My name-'s Erik Béckstrfim.
You worked with Elin at Hunters. right?
Elin had dumped Niklas. Was it
because she'd met someone else?
She didn't say anything...
...but it wasn't like her. We could
talk about almost anything. but...
But what?
You know. You sense it.
Secret phone calls in the kitchen...
- From her mobile?
- Yes.
- Why do you ask?
- We checked it but got nothing.
- But isn't the investigation over?
- Yes. it is.
But even if the formal side is done.
there are always loose ends to tie up.
She rented a flat from you. right?
I live with my boyfriend.
so she borrowed my flat.
It's awful.
All her things are still there.
Folke hasn't had it in him
to collect them.
Would you mind if I had a look?
Leave that to me...
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- L'll take care of this.
- l'll go into the kitchen.
You have no respect.
- What are you playing at?
- Just rounding off the investigation.
Unlike you. l've not been here before.
- Find anything?
- No. not yet.
Mats has called Stockholm. You're on
leave. So hands against the wall.
Fucking hell. Erik. You can't go around
with one of these if you're on leave.
Or does Stockholm
have different rules?
- What's got into you? Feeling edgy?
- No. Are you?
You'll have to sign for this
when you go home.
Well. Folke.
What can I say? Ignore him.
It'll be nice weather this weekend.
How about we take a fishing trip...
you. me and Torsten?
What's Llp'_7
Torsten was off his watch when Elin...
- He was so weird when he returned.
- Do you understand what...?
What are you saying?
Promise you won't tell anyone.
Promise? Not a soul.
Good.
It'll be alright. you'll see.
- Pia here.
- Er/k Bécksfrd/11. /s /f a bad f/me?
Did Elin do anything special
over the Ascension bank holiday?
She was meant to work but it
was a friend's birthday in Stockholm.
Stockholm?
Thanks.
Was it him again?
Which is Erik Béckstr6m's room?
- Six.
- Can I have the key?
Hi. this is Erik Béckstrfim.
L'd like some information
about a property.
Jérvfors 22:8. Yes. l'll hold.
Hang on...
"Gunnar Bodsjti".
Can you give me a second...?
What's this?
You think you'll get away with this.
you bastard? What'll you tell Mats?
Where have you been?
- Working.
- This late?
- You stink of petrol! What have-...?
- One more question and you're dead!
Torsten... Torstenl
I love you. you know that.
Sorry.
L'm just so bloody tired.
Torsten...
I just want us to move on and for
everything to be like it was before.
Before what?
- What?
- What do you mean? "Before" what?
- Before all this...
- Before what. Karin?
- Elinl
- Not your fucking jealousy again!
I know you left the hunt.
Who told you that?
Who the fuck told you that?
Are you using Peter as an alibi?
Are you?
I need no alibi. Not me.
It's off a bit to the left.
8 o'clock. 10 cm.
Shit. Come back and we-'II fi>< it.
In my job. Peter.
there are things I can't talk about.
Not even to Karin or to you.
Like that afternoon on the hunt.
I had to go off for a bit.
It was because the-y'd found Elin's car.
It was after. when you came back.
But the-y'd found blood in the car.
Mats couldn't say that
over the radio.
That's why we called it off.
to check it out. Have you forgotten?
We must be able to trust each other.
If you have questions. don't go to Mum
or a friend. come straight to me.
Good.
I shouldn't really do this.
lt'd be highly irregular.
But I think you're mature enough
to hear the truth.
Erik drove your father to his grave.
His own brother.
It happened during a hunt. A man
had been killed by a stray bullet.
Even though
there were several hunters involved...
...Erik got it into his head that
your father had fired the fatal shot.
He wanted him sent down for murder.
And when your dad
was branded a killer...
...he blew himself to smithereens.
I know.
I just want you to know the truth.
It's just you and me. Peter.
Never forget that.
Nothing strange about that. Someone
rang Torsten about an ongoing break-in.
Who?
- Folk here prefer to remain anonymous.
- What a surprise.
He-'s had all night to clean up here!
Smell it? lt's diesel!
There'll be no trace of anything left.
Shit.
Elin's body had been down here.
There was blood and hair.
He's scrubbed the place with diesel.
Can't you smell it?
Torsten was here with Elin
on at least one occasion.
And the phone I found in her flat...
She took pictures with it here.
- Where is it?
- Torsten took it.
- Did he?
- Not that I saw.
You were-n't even here!
Astrtim wrote the report.
He and Torsten came here together.
- Erik!
- You were-n't fucking here. were you!
Erik! Back off! Let him go!
Are you going to give a false
testimony? You fucking little rat!
You oan't come here
accusing my police officers
of being involved in a murder
that's already been solved!
Erik. please take your private family
feuds to another police district.
Esa. / need your he/,0.
Jari ca//ed me and said /1e'd seen
Torsfen co/11/ng out off/1e forest.
Jari was the only one
not to fake 7'0rsfen's s/1/f.'
The day you released him
he went straight to Torsten's house.
Vvhy?
He thought he-'d molested Irena.
I tried to stop him.
- So what happened?
- Torsten wasn't at home.
But Jari thought he was hiding
and too scared to come out.
It was only when his wife tried
to blow his head off that he left.
Look at me! Look at me!
Do you know what kind
of gun she used? What kind of gun?
A rifle.
- This was the day after Jari got out?
- Yes.
And 7'0rsfen's gun
was /ac/(ed up at the stat/on?
S0 f/1ere's only one Weapon
of that ca//bre We /1a I/en 'f checked.
- D0 you f/1/nk /'/11 making f/1/s up?
- Er/k. /1e was/7'! el/en out hunt/ng.
Leave this to me. OK?
- Coffee?
- No thanks. Elof. we won't be staying.
I just wanted to talk to you about your
sporting rifle. I need to test fire it.
Why? lt's fully licensed.
You have a weapon of the same
calibre as was used by Elin's killer.
- Can you show us the rifle?
- Of course.
Elof. have you lent
the gun to Karin this autumn?
Karin? No. Why?
Torste-n's taken it.
- When did he do that?
- Some time at the start of the hunt.
How does it feel
to be doing his dirty work?
Esa claims that Jari was here
the day after his release.
And that Karin shot at him
with a sporting rifle.
- Karin?
- Yes.
What. do you actually
believe that. Mats?
On that day. your rifle
was locked up at the station.
- Are you sure Elof's gun wasn't here?
- Elof's gun? Look. the case is closed.
- Why did you borrow a rifle from Elof?
- You've crossed a line now. Mats.
Answer the question.
The rifle's in the gun safe.
I can go and get it myself.
L'll be talking to Karin too.
just so you know.
As my old mum used to say:
"Every job has its man".
I never shot at Jaril
Whds been saying that?
- Do you want to talk to Peter too?
- l'm going to have to.
Peter!
Torsten will probably
be prosecuted for Elin's murder.
- He was on watch the whole time.
- That's not true and you know it.
I say this because I want you
to start thinking of yourself.
I want you to know I care about you.
What will I do when you're done here?
Kill myself like Dad did?
- What are you talking about?
- You made Dad kill himself.
- You don't care that we-'re family!
- That's not true.
Everyone has a choice.
Leif made his choice.
Your dad took his own life.
It was his choice. not mine.
Could you have stopped him?
- You've got it wrong. Accept it.
- No.
- Elof's rifle isn't the murder weapon.
- Some-thing's not right!
You made me question Karin about
information you got from Esa Lipponenl
- Esa's telling the truth!
- That's enough!
It's time for you to pack
your bags and get out. Erik.
Anol I olon't want you talking to
another bloody person in this inquiry.
Are we agreed?
Good.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What are you doing?
Writing out a theft report.
- L'm really sorry. Torsten. I was...
- lt's forgotten.
- Sure?
- Yep.
Hang on. l'll just write...
I think you should give Karin a call.
She took it quite badly.
- Of course. I understand.
- That's good.
Fuck...
What's been stolen?
I was out walking by the quarry.
and when I got back 20 minutes later
some bastard had smashed my car
window and stolen my rifle and stereo.
- And a lottery scratch card!
- The sporting rifle?
Luckily I had the bolt in my pocket.
Don't worry. it's been test fired.
Have you got round to checking it?
Yes. and f/1ey've not made a /11/stake.
But I ran the bullet through our system
to see if the gun had turned up before.
- And it had. In our investigation.
- How the he-ll...?
7'/1e r/fie was the first one We tested.
He fr/c/(ed us. Torsfen fired
the first s/10! /1/mse//'T remember?
7'/1e/7 /1e
WfofE' down the serial number.
But he wrote the number of the rifle he
shot Elin with. then fired Elof's gun.
So we have-n't test fired
one of his rifles!
Officially yes. lt's in the computer
but with the wrong pattern.
So we test fire it again!
We would /f the bastard had/7't
reported /t sto/en four hours ago.
Peter! Can you turn it down please?
Karin. come and sit down.
Nothing for me.
I become such a pain when I drink.
Do you remember the first time
we drank this wine? Tenerife. it was.
Did you borrow Gunnar's cottage
up by Jérvforsen?
No.
Gunnar called wondering
why the police had been there.
I asked when you'd
first borrowed the place.
You told me
you were on a course that weekend.
- Are you going to kick off again?
- I know you were fucking Elin there.
For the entire Ascension holiday!
Stop that talk.
How the hell do you think I feel?
Accused by my colleagues
and now by you.
L've been loyal to you.
I lied to Mats. I destroyed
that damn pregnancy test.
Yes. I know she was pregnant.
Is that why you killed her?
If you betray me once more. that's it.
Ne><t time.
l'll bloody well tell the truth.
So how will you explain
the fingerprints?
- What are you talking about?
- Your prints on the rifle.
- I shot at Jari out of self-defence!
- Did you now?
That's not what you told the police.
How's it to be Karin?
The-y're your fingerprints
on the murder weapon. not mine.
What'll happen when the police find
that out? Have you thought about that?
And what'll happen to Peter?
You won't stop at anything. will you!
You just use everyone!
How the hell can you drag Peter into
this? How fucking low can you get?
Take a look in the mirror.
you parasite!
Must you destroy
everything l've built up!
Stop in
- Go to your room. Peter.
- Torsten should be the one to go.
- You do as you're told!
- No. No.
Lay one more finger on us and l'll go
to the police with the rifle. Hear me?
- What's your game. Peter?
- lt's no longer where you buried it.
- L'll tell them everything.
- You'll go to the police?
I am the police. No one does
that to me. Peter. understand?
What the fuck are you playing at?
lt's me. Torsten. you're dealing with!
- Fuck with me and you'll regret it!
- Just fuck off!
Hear me? Hear me?
$orry!
- Hello?
- He//0. Peter. Don'! hang up.
I just want to say that I took what
you said about your dad to heart.
You were right. I could have done more.
/ could /1a I/e stopped /1//11.
- Are you sf/// there?
- Yes.
But you're wrong
when you say I olon't care about you.
I want you to know
l'll never let you olown.
W/vafel/er/1a,0,0e/vs. /'// be there
for you. 7'/1af's Why /'/11 here.
I know where the murder weapon is.
- Peter. l'll come and get you.
- You mus!/7'! come here.
Why not? Has something happened.
Meet me by the river.
You mustn't come here.
Don't take any risks. OK?
- Peter?
- Who mustn't come here?
Hello?
- Peter!
- Mum! Mum!
Peter. stop!
Or l'll blow your mother's head off.
Peter. come back!
We belong together.
We-'II sort this problem out together.
He won't give in. He-'II destroy us.
and I won't let that happen.
Because no one does that to me.
My family.
As soon as he arrives
and touches the door handle
l'll do what I have to do.
Peter. I love you like my own son.
Erik killed his brother.
He does not deserve your respect. No.
Karin... Peter...
If we can just do this together.
things will go back to how they were.
Good. Let's shake on it.
Run. Peter. run!
Karin. Karin. where-'s Peter?
- Where-'s Peter. Karin?
- Peter ran off.
Torsten's after him.
You must help him. Help Peter.
Peter!
Send an ambulance at once
to Torste-n's house.
Karin's been badly beaten.
No. it's serious! If you don't
do as I say. on your head be it!
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
Shall we go home?
Mum's got dinner ready.
You know what she gets like
if we-'re late.
Come on.
Freeze. you bastard! Drop the gun!
The ne><t one goes
right between your eyes.
Go back to your fucking car
and get out of here.
Hey! We're going home now. Peter.
We're going home.
Can't you just fucking leave us alone?
We don't want anything to do with you.
Don't you get that?
Pete-r's coming with me.
Come on. Peter.
Take your fucking hands off...
Peter!
Are you alright? Take it easy.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Look at me. Let me see...
Leave the boy alone! Leave him alone!
He needs help. Torstenl
- Peter!
- No.
Get up. Peter!
Leave the boy alone. I said!
What have you done to him?
Peter!
There-'s no way out of this. Torsten.
Put down that gun!
That's what you want. isn't it.
To destroy.
Put the gun down.
- Peter!
- Go away!
We were going to go fishing!
You... you bastard!
Look after the lad.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Get in. Or we-'II miss the ferry.
- Where are we going?
- Sure you don't want to come?
This is something
you need to olo yourselves.
Go on then. bugger off!
Are you going to tell me
where we-'re going?
Home.
You wanted to see
where your dad grew up. didn't you?
Yes.
