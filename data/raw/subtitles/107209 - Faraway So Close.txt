You...
you, whom we love...
you do not see us...
you do not hear us.
You imagine us in the far distance...
yet we are so near.
We are messengers...
who bring closeness
to those who are distant.
We are messengers...
who bring the light
to those who are in darkness.
We are messengers...
who bring the word
to those who question.
We are neither the light,
nor the message.
We are the messengers.
We...
are nothing.
You are, forus...
everything.
Most children's accidents
don't happen in traffic.
They happen at home
when some medicine lies around.
Naturally, one can
always get divorced!
They can't even issue receipts,
much less guarantees.
West Berlin looks just like East Berlin.
What'sall the fuss?
Saying it's colder in the north
than in the south-- that's big news!
Yes, the age-old question.
The meaning of life.
Why is mankind here?
Such a short moment,
compared with eternity.
I wonder, is it better or worse
for people not to know their fate?
Better, I think, since they search
throughout their lives...
and ponder the purpose
of their existence.
Here are some very moving verses...
by our fellow country man...
Fyodor Tyuchev,
poet and diplomat.
"Unity...
as proclaimed the world over...
can only be forged...
with blood and steel.
We shall let love
show us the way.
Then we shall see
which one lasts longer. "
I'm certain that a secure world...
can't be built on blood.
Only on harmony.
We humans--
politicians, philosophers...
actors, workers, farmers...
people of all creeds...
we must agree on this.
If we can agree only on this,
we will solve all the rest.
To every thing there is a season...
a time to every purpose
under heaven.
There is a time to be born...
a time to die...
a time to kill...
a time to heal...
a time to weep...
a time to laugh...
a time to seek...
a time to keep silent...
How do you cry
when you have no eyes?
a time to speak...
Bird's-eye view... soldiers fleeing.
a time to love.
They seem to flee from each other.
If only our tears could help them,
Raphaela.
If only we could lightup
their darkness occasionally.
Let us never stop
celebrating the light, Cassiel.
The light alone
reveals them to themselves.
What am I now?
- A time...
- Poplars near the house.
- to love...
- Two poplars. They form a gate...
- a time...
- through which one must pass.
- to hate...
- They must grow. The path is so easy.
- a time...
- It maybe long...
for conflict...
but He will forgive
every step you've taken.
a time...
Otherwise the poplars
wouldn't be there.
for peace.
Always two poplars.
One gate.
Come, Path. Now you must be
the only one.
But why can't I come with you?
- You've got to get well.
- I'm well.
And your sore throat?
What a drag!
Why can't we go on Saturday?
That would be a great idea,
if Konrad would remember to eat.
But he forgets that he should eat.
So wear your scarf,
and don't play outside.
I know that.
I'm not stupid.
I'll go to my room
and play Gameboy.
I hope that's allowed...
if someone has a sore throat.
Most of us are soboring
because our cities are soboring.
Long ago the nomads
must have been overcome by boredom...
so they said, "Let us build,
here and there and there...
some hideous cities
made of stone...
so that our world-weariness
lies in the squares and streets...
houses and apartments.
Because we're empty
and we'reallin!
We're all empty and all in. "
What's that called?
"Chasing the wind... "
Something is needed--
some kind of joy.
Konrad?
Konrad?
Murphy.
"Today is like any other day.
Time goes by much slower. "
What a  strange thought!
As if time were painful.
Konrad?
Konrad.
Oh, Hanna.
A hug.
Watch out.
I'm covered in oil.
It doesn't matter.
You always are.
Where's our little sweetheart?
- She's got a sore throat.
- Now? ln the middle of summer?
Give her lots ofice cream.
It's soothing.
You and your home remedies!
It'll be gone tomorrow.
Yes.
I always gave you ice-cream
when you had a sore throat.
Except once.
Really? Oh, yes!
I had to call the doctor.
I don't remember the reason.
I had diphtheria.
If you need me,
I'll be in the trailer.
Fine.
Hanna?
Old men and their housekeeping!
Young men are even more untidy.
It's just that there are more reasons
to forgive them.
That's the difference.
Right, you old eagle?
Such nonsense!
Why am I talking to you?
You're still a young bird...
built in 1938.
Wasn't that just yesterday?
I remember what was going on
in the world when you appeared.
The Anschluss ofAustria,
then the skirmishes...
with the Czechs.
The smell of war
was in the air...
although no one knew
what kind of war.
You were sent to the front...
because of your sliding roof...
which is normally meant
for sunshine and fresh air.
Well...
that assignment wasn't spelled out
in your factory guarantee.
Bing, bang,
you were ready for war time use.
Everything is ready
for war time use...
anytime, anywhere.
Our passengers were
all top brass.
I always said being a chauffeur
is not a job.
It's the only
extra marital relationship...
where you gain nothing.
Drive a customer
down to the Sudeten land...
and back to the city
the same evening.
To Thuringia, to Bavaria...
way up to the coast.
Three hours' waitin Regensburg!
I paced back and forth...
without letting you
out of my sight.
You were so new,
my agle...
and so damned beautiful.
Only once did we get carried away.
Two minutes before the end...
in April, 1945.
But that was enough, Doctor!
Or when we were
on loan to someone...
whose driver had pneumonia.
If time were merely painful to them...
then their perfection
would make nosense.
This small piece of a human being
is perfect.
A tooth!
Whoever observes it
can see a face...
can see eyes,
can hear breathing.
In some places,
time seems to want to linger.
Not that it stands still.
It just moves in different ways.
These maybe places
where people once worked...
talked in confusion
and cursed.
Then, one day, these places
were no longer important.
This breathing is now...
and now...
and now...
and still now.
What's keeping him?
The world is about to end!
Okay, let's see you step on it!
I'll do my best, Mr. Becker.
It's the last plane!
If writing appeared in the sky now,
saying...
"You Germans are no onger
needed in this world"...
what a blessing that would be!
Will there be many Germans
in America, Dad?
Any kids that I know?
Anton, you'll meet American kids.
Real pals.
Boy Scouts.
- What's that?
- Like our scouts.
You'll learn a new sport:
baseball.
A new life!
You'll be amazed.
Why don't you stop talking?
Why must everything
first fall apart...
disappear...
every gesture, every plea...
before you realize
that you're not listening...
that you're deaf?
Gertrud, get a grip on yourself,
for once!
You'll have to live in here now.
Stay safe in thebox,
so that nothing can happen to me.
So many things can happen outside,
if you're notlucky.
Look, Raphaela!
Wenever had baby teeth...
never pried them loose...
never held one with the thumb
and index finger...
to cast over our shoulder
for good luck.
We cannot exert any influence
over time.
We weren't expecting time, Cassiel.
And once time was already there...
we didn't believe it could
make us observers one day.
It's hard to observe time...
which knows so little about itself
and its own dimensions.
I'd like to give this little tooth
to someone.
Even knowing that I'd be tampering
with its human existence.
Unforgivable!
Most people's behavior
makes little sense.
It's just a pastime, game-playing,
exploiting time.
They're all basement dwellers,
to be exact.
- You saw the license plate?
- Sure. I'm not blind.
Who are those two figures?
They're unimportant.
Remove them.
I want no trace of their Nazi past.
Can you do that?
Listen, that's my job!
Winter, I'm always afraid
you'll over do it one day.
Oh, I'm fairly stable.
When?
Let's say Wednesday.
Okay. I'll come on Thursday,
between 1 0:00 and 11 :00.
You can also come between
1 1 :00 and 1 0:00.
I'm always here.
A shitty profession, eh?
Dear God, forgive me for choosing
to become a forger.
- Here, your cassettes. All X-rated.
- Let me make sure they're okay.
No touching until we're gone.
Get it?
- This works?
- Shut up. My stuff isn't shit.
Come.
If these are lousy,
you'll regret it!
And if the gun doesn't work,
watch out!
And you, Dad, I'll waste you,
you bastard!
You'll never beat me up again!
On Sunday, in the garden.
Prepare yourself.
Then I'll split,
to Holland or somewhere.
It still amazes me...
that you don't have to think
about what you do...
once you've established
a routine.
You can think any thoughts...
draw your conclusions,
contradict them...
just like an angel,
but without the exclusivity.
Meanwhile you create something!
Something to eat, a chair,
a fur hat, a pizza.
Lots of necessary things,
and plenty of them...
so there'll be enough some day.
At the same time you must think
about what isn'tnecessary...
and what's still missing.
Otherwise you'd only have things
that already exist...
and you'd be bored.
There's that ringing in my ear again.
Oh, Cassiel, you'll never know
how my pizza tastes.
What a shame.
- Hello.
- Hi, Damiel.
Doria, my love!
I always know when it's you
phoning me. What's up?
Yes, tell me.
I'm as light as a feather.
Very good.
Mama is on the trapeze with Jules.
She looks beautiful.
Paul and Paula
are two inseparable birds.
And Lalli?
Uncle Lalli tells everybody
they should do even better.
-And Maurice?
- Maurice is clowning around.
Now I'll hang up because
I want to watch some more.
- Kiss Mama, mylove.
- Sure.
- Bye, Damiel.
- See you later.
My papa is curious.
He always wants to know
how things are going.
He's right.
It's important.
- Damiel sends you a kiss.
- Thank you, darling.
- You'll be the little mermaid?
- Yes!
Smile, Marion.
She's like a feather,
your daughter.
A feather from your wing.
You're beautiful,
my little feather!
A fragile angel
with wings of paper...
from the Book of Dreams.
You and your father
are like the eternal lovers...
Iike the moon and the sun
who only meet at dusk...
but whose eyes
are perpetually locked.
I need to see only one of you...
to know whether you're both happy.
You both love things,
like conspiring lovers.
An underwater cabaret
with confetti and streamers...
smoke and naked girls.
That would be great!
The best ideas come too late.
Too bad!
- Should we stop, Marion?
- Yes.
That's it!
You've worked hard, kids.
Me, too.
Now it's time to tango.
And you?
What about you?
Papa would like to understand
why we're not afraid to fly.
I really have to tell him tonight.
You and your father,
you share the same inner time.
With just one look...
you tell each other:
"Let's forget that life can be hard. "
Suppose you could really draw.
Suppose you were a real artist.
Oh, boy, wouldn't tha tbe
something?
Mr. Falk?
I am so pleased to discover the...
artist behind the actor.
These drawings
are really very great.
Well, thank you very much, ma'am.
I appreciate that.
They tell me I'm in East Berlin.
I'dlike to get out of here
and see the city.
If that's art,
I'm a monkey's uncle.
Mr. Falk.
Mr. Falk, I'm an artist myself,
but I paint.
- You have great abilities.
- Thank you.
But you must go for color.
Color is so expressive.
Without color, I would die.
Talking about color, sir,
you like Michelangelo?
Yeah.
Can you imagine Michelangelo
without color?
You know what he said
to the pope?
The pope complimented him
on the Sistine Chapel.
Michelangelo said
it was all in the drawing.
The rest he could get by
pissing on it.
I am a stone
that slowly becomes slower...
as it sinks heavily to the bed
of the deepest river.
No, I'm a wood chuck.
You're a daisy.
I'm a mushroom.
Is your ear ringing again, Papa?
It's my friend!
Again!
Maybe he wants
to tell you something.
I never know
what he wants to tell me.
You just want to go back
to sleep.
Tell me something about him.
He's always traveling
and never has time to write to us.
He's really a good-for-nothing.
He really can't do anything?
He can do rabbits.
Like this.
That's dumb.
Anyone can do that!
He also knows
how to do wolves.
That's more difficult,
you'll have to admit.
Watch out, rabbit!
You see?
My rabbit has a guardian angel.
Cassiel, beat it!
Let's sleep.
Is Mama working late again
at the " Purgatory" tonight?
Someone has to earn money.
Most people you meet
are missing persons.
Their names,
which they love hearing out loud...
their quirks,
their unexpected grins...
or their sudden groans
in a shoe store...
as if they were at home--
It's all posturing.
The night has gone to the dogs.
Don't you agree
that something awful has happened?
There is no more night.
There are hints,
but what are hints compared to nights?
Stop that wiping.
Have a drink with me.
I know you won't.
That's why the night
went to the dogs.
Don't you know...
that every night
is basically just a dog?
I've heard about that before,
but somehow I must have forgotten it.
Memory has gone
to the dogs as well.
You're right.
You're so right.
Actually, they're missing persons
who have reappeared.
They know that we--
Oops!
What do we reallyknow?
Now I lost my train of thought.
Don't drink too much again, Winter!
Let's talk turkey,
Mr. Baker.
I hate working
in the dark like this.
I don't know why
you're looking for this Hanna!
Why should I help you find her?
This case is for the birds!
Take your dollars
and hire an amateur detective.
Maybe you'll get lucky
and find one!
Mazeltov, Mr. Baker!
Mazeltov is good.
It's got a snappy sound--
mazel-tough !
I'll turn the tables on him!
I'm sorry.
Can't be him, in Berlin!
I must see Tony Baker, now!
You picked a bad time.
Don't tell me
what I've picked!
Tell Baker that Winter is here.
Looks like an interesting game.
Very interesting.
Your 1 000 and another 500.
I'm in.
$500 to see you both,
gentlemen.
Well, my friends, your 500,
and I'll raise you another 500.
Your 500...
and...
With this hand I can'tlose.
another...
5,000.
I'll bring you down, Baker.
Be careful, Peter Patzke.
I'll take you to the cleaners,
Patzke!
But not tonight.
The stakes are too high for me.
It's all yours, Herr Patzke.
I am out.
Me too.
Nobody looks into my cards, ever.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I have some business to attend to.
So, Winter, what can you
report to me this time?
Report to you?
Let's talk turkey,
Mr. Tony Baker.
I'm... uh... working in the dark.
I don't enjoy
following this woman.
This case is for the boards!
I mean birds.
Gety ourself an amateur,
you understand?
Nothing.
I don't go for this bullshit.
Come on, Winter.
You had an assignment.
I don't get it.
Couldn't you find her?
Assignment! Don't make me laugh.
You know what an assignment is?
In otherwords,
you couldn't find this woman.
I found another person.
A certain Anton Becker,
born in 1937 in Hirschberg.
Becker's father,
whose first name was also Anton...
joined the Nazi Propaganda Ministry
that same year.
Wife and children followed him
to Berlin a few weeks later.
So what?
A typical move to Berlin.
Yes, maybe so.
But there's more.
1945, only the boy and his father
emigrated to America.
Raised in Los Angeles, U.S.A.
In Germany
he is presumed dead.
No contact with his sister,
living at that time in the Soviet Zone.
The mother disappeared
in the postwar chaos.
Education--
Education-- none.
Wait--yes.
Majored in history. Quit studies.
He became a car dealer in Detroit.
Married, divorced, bankrupt.
Back in Berlin since 1990.
Various P.O. addresses, east and west.
Since the reunification,
Tony Baker, Film Distributor.
Import-export, joint ventures
with many Eastern-bloc countries.
Except most of your business
has nothing to do with movies!
Something's fishy.
I've kept
a record of expenses.
Give me a call, Mr. Baker,
or send me a postcard.
I may send you a cement block
and a chain foryour neck.
Mazeltov, Mr. Becker.
Lousy luck to you!
Charge it to Mr. Tony Baker.
Ha! " Lousy Luck"!
In Berlin, after the Wall
It's very nice
It's paradise
I should take notes.
I knew it.
I had this great line last night.
I thought I'd never forget it,
and now I have.
It's gone.
What was it about?
What did I do last night?
I was in the car.
I drove down the street.
Excuse me.
Could you take me
to Rumelsburg?
I never heard about it.
You know where it is?
You're asking me?
I've been in this city twice.
Once six years ago
and tonight.
Sorry, I don't know
where Rumelsburg is.
Is it in East Berlin?
Because I never drive in the East.
But this is the East.
You're in the East.
You know, there was an incident
a couple of years ago.
They tore down a wall.
I don't know if you recall...
but for me it was a big thing.
So I'm walking five hours
just to take in the city.
I suppose I could take it in
for another hour.
Can you find Rumelsburg
in an hour?
I can try,
but Rumelsburg is a sub-city.
Shit! Where's he wanna go?
Now you're sleeping, Raissa.
In your child's dream...
the day's images tumble around
with all your memories.
I see them before me.
And you see me,
but just in your dream.
You know that I'm beside you.
If only you could
keep this knowledge...
without having it chased away
as you grow up.
I don't want to know anything!
It doesn't take much
to be happy.
Where's my coffee, Louis?
Smoke, naked girls--
that would be great.
Good ideas always come too late.
I'm almost weary, Cassiel.
It's so exhausting to love people
who run away from us.
Why do they shun us
more and more?
Because we have
a powerful enemy, Raphaela.
People believe more
in the world than in us.
And to believe still more...
they've created an image
of every thing.
They expect images
to allay their fears...
fulfill their dreams...
provide their pleasures...
satisfy their longings.
Human beings didn't master
the Earth.
The Earth has become
their master.
Remember how simple
it once was?
We would appear to them
and put words into their hearts.
We could say, "Fearnot,
I've come to proclaim--"
That's when we were
the only voices.
Now people are besieged
by new lies every day.
Ever louder, baser
and more intrusive lies...
which dull their senses...
so they're unable
to hear our message.
"But the heart of this people
is grown hard...
their eyes are closed...
and their ears can't hear...
lest they see with their eyes...
and hear with their ears
and understand with their heart. "
How I long to be
one of them!
To see with their eyes...
to hear with their ears...
to understand
how they experience time...
how they learn about death...
how they feel love...
and how they perceive
the world.
Tobe one of them...
and sobe come a brighter
messenger of light, in these dark days.
Let us part for today, Raphaela.
Raphaela!
It'shappened!
I've become one of them!
It's crazy!
Where did you come from
so suddenly?
Can you hear me, Raphaela?
Are you still there?
Just don't leave me alone!
Aren'tyou gonna put me down?
Come, sit next to me.
It's so vivid here!
So many colors!
And so warm!
But you're wearing
a winter coat.
A winter coat?
Why not?
You're wearing a scarf.
Do I talk too loudly?
It's okay.
Try to whisper.
Whisper?
Whisper...
Iike this?
Now shout loudly!
Hello!
Not bad, eh?
Where are you?
- I'm Raissa.
- I know.
And you?
Cassiel.
Weird name.
You think so?
You... you look so familiar.
Be careful.
You be careful, too.
I had no idea, Raphaela!
This light, for instance.
I think it's neon.
You can't imagine how cold it is,
and what harsh outlines it creates.
It's a light for travelers because
it drives people into high gear.
We always wondered
why they were constantly in a rush.
Now I know.
It's the light.
They've pitted it
against the sun.
They're caught up
in their damn speed, I tell you.
Enough for now.
You won't believe
what's still ahead ofme.
I have to get organized,
make plans, think.
Now I can intervene, mingle.
Now I'm human.
Yesterday
you were a zombie?
Edgar!
Stop bothering people.
In the beginning,
there was no time.
After a moment,
time began with a splat.
What?
Excuse me.
You were talking to me?
Yes.
What did you say?
There's a word on your forehead,
Cassiel, written with tears.
It's a word for loss...
describing someone who wanted
to see paradise from the outside...
and never found his way back.
A word waiting to appear one day
just for the tiniest moment.
- How do you know my name?
- The name is not important.
It's the word
on your forehead.
Guard it.
Try your luck?
One, two, three!
Only a hundred marks.
Hundred marks.
It's a lot ofmoney.
Sometimes it's a lot.
Sometimes it's nothing.
I'm completely broke.
I have no money at all.
I'll do you a favor.
I'll take that off you
for a hundred marks.
My armor?
I'll give you 200 for it.
It's easy.
You just gotta pay attention.
That's impossible!
- Where is everybody?
- Hey! What are you up to?
Hands off. Let me go!
I lost.
I lost everything!
Old hunters never die.
They just fade away.
I know.
But not me. Never.
What do you want
from him?
He just doesn't belong here.
He's irregular.
So what?
There's darkness pouring down, my dear,
and it's deep enough to drown you.
You talk about darkness
because you're in love with it.
Honey, I hate it.
It's rotten and dull.
Frankly, it stinks.
Give him a chance
to find it out.
You want clouds,
you can't forget the wind.
What's your name?
You must have a name.
Of course.
I'm not just anybody.
Right.
What's so hard?
Just a name!
If you want,
spell it backwards.
What's your name?
Raven.
You must feel better already.
Spelled like the bird?
Yes, Raven.
- First name?
- Ralph.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Keep writing.
Refugee... victim
of robbers and horse thieves...
beginner... sensitive... destitute...
specialist and layman
all in one, you might say.
One thing at a time, Mr. Raven.
Where do you live?
Where do you sleep?
Around.
Around? Here and there?
The pizzeria, "Casa dell'Angelo."
You sleep in the oven, I suppose?
- You don't believe me?
- No!
They couldn't keep
the real raven in here.
He'd fly right out.
But me?
Cassiel.
Damiel!
- Tomorrow you'll have cramps.
- What's that?
You'll find out.
- Ever looked in there?
- No.
My neighbor, a great woman.
She opens at noon.
That's my joint.
You know it.
Smaller than I thought.
Beginnings are always hard.
First, I think,
a small espresso...
with three, four, five sugar cubes.
Then a brandy
to warm the belly.
Then a cappuccino
with warm, frothy milk.
- Then prosciutto.
- Prosciutto.
- Parmigiano.
- Cheese.
- Olives.
- Olives.
A shower and warm clothes.
- Yes.
- I'll makeyou a pizza.
Good morning, gentlemen.
He's the ringing in your ear?
Yes.
Miss, from now on
you can call me Uncle Karl.
Damiel told us lots aboutyou...
but we really
don't know anything.
Did he stop traveling
to stay with us?
He'll tell you.
Tell about your travels,
Uncle Karl.
All right.
Recently I came from...
the far north...
from Norway...
which you could guess
from my clothes.
I had planned
to catch reindeer and elk.
I told you he was
a good-for-nothing.
Actually, I was bitten
by one of those animals.
There I was with my bite,
wondering...
who could heal me?
Then I knew.
A Lap lander, of course!
So, I slogged on
toward Lapland...
through blizzards,
fighting offwolves...
squinting all the while
because ofthe northern lights!
You understand his story?
I understand completely.
It's interesting, Uncle Karl.
My papa also told me...
a mysterious story.
He said he fell from the sky.
Doria, leave him alone now.
Karl hasn't eaten
in a long time.
I'll be staying for a while.
I'll tell you many stories.
So much!
Uncle is hungry.
Okay.
Olive.
Watch out, it's stuffed.
Finally!
I can be useful.
Let's get rid of this thing.
I'll put it where it can't
do any harm, Raphaela.
My first good deed,
the first of many.
Hair color: reddish.
Who'd have thought it?
Six marks.
The cost of living
is so high, Raphaela.
Identity.
What is that, actually?
They mention it a lot.
We'll know soon.
" Look at the birdie."
Without identity,
you're nobody here, Raphaela.
Last name, first name,
date of birth...
I'll need all that now.
Without a picture of yourself,
you're nobody.
Only with a proper picture
do you become somebody.
The right name is half the battle.
Short and snappy is best.
A name is just a name.
Karl Engel.
That's me.
- Should I wrap them?
- No, they're fine.
That's me. Ouch!
No.
That's not me.
Karl Engel, huh?
Blue eyes-- how original!
Original? Don't talk!
Just listen!
I need a passport in this name.
It's not pretty--
It's downright ugly.
But since I cannot use
my previous name...
I'm prepared to go...
to extremes!
Just take it easy.
We don't let anyone down.
It takes two days...
and 3,000 big ones.
How about a small advance?
Produce something for your money first.
I'll be in touch.
"The man with the cut flowers."
- How was your first day?
- Good.
What's the house drink?
Cherry juice.
Then I'll have cherry juice.
That's what the men drink here?
- Would Damiel drink this?
- Yes, he likes it.
Is he a typical man?
Yes, but don't model yourself
after him!
- He has more experience.
- So what?
Most people only know...
that the world
and all life in it...
just simply exists.
I've always wanted to know...
whether the world is the same
for men and forwomen.
Are women different?
Women are human beings.
They carry a human light.
Men search and search...
until they find the warmth
that they're always missing.
Until they're understood.
That's all I can say.
Son of a bitch!
I've been looking foryou
all over the place.
You been sitting here
the whole time?
Let me buy you a drink.
Do we know each other?
I know everybody
I've ever drankwith.
- Maybeyou should ask him first if--
- Look.
I'm buying,
and I think he looks thirsty.
Prosit.
This is brandy.
It smells...
like nothing.
It tastes...
like something burning.
Abso-fucking-lutely!
Down the hatch.
Know what you're drinking?
Sure. Firewater!
Exactly.
Let's have another round.
There is no difference
between men and women.
They are all the same.
So long as they carry a light
deep inside them.
Fire!
What I have to do is--
We must learn not to worship women
all the time.
Oh, man, that's bullshit.
They really eat that shit up!
Are you sure?
Thank you.
I just can follow my instincts.
Miss...
can you-- cocktails?
No trace of the police yet...
and we're trapped.
Karl.
"The World Grieves For Willy Brandt"
Every thing goes by
so fast here, Raphaela.
A day here
is like a blink of your eye.
A week is like an angel
turning his head.
A human life is like--
Well, I don't know that yet.
Good morning.
Breakfast time.
I'd like to buy something.
I don't sell crusts.
How about something else?
Waffles?
Cakes?
With poppy seeds?
You just want to swipe something.
- Pardon me?
- I know.
You talk,
I turn around, you steal.
Now, listen--
Here.
I have money.
What's that for?
Nothing here costs pennies.
Anything else?
Otherwise, scram!
Yeah. Brandy!
Oh, not again!
Yes.
Shit!
You're nuts!
I wasn't even
listening in on you.
Try listening now!
So this is loneliness, Raphaela.
It's really bad.
No one hears
what the other feels.
No one looks
into the other'sheart.
Nobody asks anything,
not even for directions.
What am I doing here?
Just watching day turn tonight
and back to day?
Nothing makes sense.
I must not
lose sight of my mission:
How do humans see and hear?
All I can say right now is,
it's all enticingly beautiful!
It's warm...
the evening settles in...
the birds have a celebration...
the sky turns pastel colors.
But what's beyond it?
I no longer see or hear
the breath of eternity...
the universal laws,
orthelightoflove.
For humans, Raphaela,
I think there is no beyond.
Each one creates his own world
within his own vision and hearing.
He remains a prisoner in it.
And from his cell
he sees the cells of others.
Hurry, Doria!
Was that Karl?
Yes, but we won't tell Papa.
Raphaela! Where are you?
I know you're here!
Give me a sign.
You're all here.
Today is Sunday.
I don't know
which Sunday.
Time passes too quickly.
I don't have the stamina.
Where are you?
This is no life.
No life at all.
Raphaela!
You're all here. I know it.
You're all here.
I can't go on.
We humans are confined
by what's visible, Raphaela!
Only what we can see matters.
It's all we believe in.
Invisible things don't count.
Only the things
we can touch...
truly exist forus.
I also take pennies.
Every bit helps.
Step lively!
Watch the closing doors!
I'm coming.
You're all losers.
Yes, you too.
Forget it!
You're the snows of yesteryear!
I'll make sure it doesn't
snow tomorrow. Understand?
Everything--
What the fuck
are you going on about, man?
Before--
For Christ's sake,
don't worry about snow.
Get up.
I know you!
I saw your concert.
Why can't I be good?
I swear, if I knew,
I would tell you.
Come on.
You can do it.
Why?
Why not?
