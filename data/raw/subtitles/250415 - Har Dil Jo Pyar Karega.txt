Hi! I'm Raj!
People have always called me a kid.
That was to suggest that I was an orphan.
It was then Mrs. Godinho came into
my life and gave me her love.
That was a signal that I was
no longer all alone in the world.
She taught me something very nice.
Do so much good to others
that they never lack goodness.
It was Mrs. Godinho
who taught me music...
and she wanted me to become
a very big singer some day.
When I grew up, I started
dreaming of someone.
My dream-girl
this was a signal that there was
someone, who was made only for me
I can't explain why, but I think
Mumbai is the city...
where a career and
my dream-girl await me.
You must wonder what `signals'
I'm talking about.
According to Mrs. Godinho, God always
gives us the right signals.
And it is we who can't see them
I've always been fond
of body-building.
Which is why I've kept away
from cigarettes and alcohol.
If there is something I ever drink,
it's a cup of hot tea.
A cup of hot tea!
And my beloved to make me drink it up.
May she be dark of skin, or fair.
But someone who will embrace me
I wish I could meet her;
And every sorrow would vanish.
When I leave home every morning,
after giving her a kiss.
And every moment I spend then missing her.
For her, I will live and die.
What else have I to do?
There will be happiness for me.
But nothing will have meaning without her.
May she be fair of skin, or even dark.
But she will embrace me.
Every sorrow would vanish,
if only I could have her.
She'll open the door for me,
when I return every evening.
She'll hug me tightly and say she loves me.
She come to me all dressed up.
And relieve me of the stress of the day.
She'll be different from the others.
She'll be my wife.
A cup of hot tea.
And my beloved to make me drink it.
May she be fair-skinned
or dark.
But someone who will care for me.
All my worries would vanish,
if only I could have her.
There it is!
The signal to go to Mumbai!
Raja!
- Aba!
Hurry up, buddy!
How are you?
- Delighted!
At last! You've got the green signal
to come to Mumbai!
Know what Mrs. Godinho says?
In Mumbai, you will make
your life and find it too.
Watch out! You're going to be
a superstar in a few days!
You'll find your dream-girl too!
So how's your uncle?
- Don't mention that name.
Why not?
- The bloody miser!
God had rather made me an orphan,
than give me an uncle like him!
I thought I'd put up
with you and your uncle.
He doesn't let me live with him.
Why would he allow you?
Really?
- Of course.
So what do you do for a living?
And where do you stay?
I work at my uncle's
fruit-juice shop, all right!
But I live in my own house.
- What?
Oh yes!
- Your own house?
A house in Mumbai!
Do you like it? Great, isn't it?
- What place is this, by the way?
Now look; I have nothing
that God has given me.
Whatever I have is what I got
from the Municipality!
It's a gift from the city of Mumbai!
Priceless stuff, I must say.
- All stolen. Real hard work, I say.
And what do you call the place?
- My home.
It's better than living on the pavements!
If it wasn't for the roof and the
walls, it's worse than the pavements!
You can't think of bathing
without water, can you?
So you mustn't call your house names.
Life is difficult in this city.
You'll get to know very soon.
That I know.
This is the city where
I will find everything.
Now tell me; what should be
my first step in the city?
Simple. You must buy a bike.
- What has that to do with singing?
This is a city of pretenses.
Those with vehicles
take off before anyone else.
We'd need money for that.
- Sure, we would.
Let me open the Reserve Bank's locker.
- Hurry up.
Here you are! Count it!
- Not me. Do it yourself.
It's 500 bucks!
- How about the time deposit?
Here's another 500 Rupees!
That makes it a grand!
But how will we get a bike in 1000?
- We've just got to open an account.
The same old gag, you mean?
Damn it!
You have given me these
post-dated checks, thank you.
Now for the last formalities. Sign
the papers and take away the bike.
Go ahead, son.
Sign it.
What's biting someone?
- Not me.
It's out there!
It's four guys against one!
Listen, son...
that isn't unusual.
Guys who issue dud checks
get beaten up like that.
Those guys are from the financing agency.
They have their own style
of recovering money.
Dangerous style!
- 35 checks out of 36 were honored.
But his last check bounced. Why?
- Such beating for one dud check?
Sure... but you needn't worry.
Why not?
- You guys come from good families.
Do we?!
Forget our checks.
We even carry cash that bounces!
He doesn't, he means.
- Right!
That's my pen!
That's not the way you sit?
- This is Mumbai.
You never know who does
what behind your back.
Get going.
I'll handle the rear end!
Hold it! Here's the studio!
The guard saluted us because
we arrived on a bike.
Or they wouldn't care!
This is a very big studio.
There's no one here, ma'am...
- No meetings without an appointment!
Abdul! You're empty-handed!
No fruit-juice for me?
No juices. I bring a singer today.
Raju. My friend from Goa.
What a singer!
...is Mr. Mishra in?
Please hold this blazer.
We'll go and see him.
Punk! I don't get to see the owner
in the ten years I do the rounds here!
And you guys just walk in
and get to meet him!
Listen, bag of bones!
He'd blow you away with his breath!
No! Don't breathe...!
Go on inside!
What's your problem?
- They've gone in. So will I.
I won't let you in!
- I'll force my way in!
What will you do in there?
- Well...? What will I?
Why was I here, mister?
- To ask for the whereabouts.
This address, right?
- Yes. Take Bus No. 80.
Get off at the last stop.
That's where your house is.
Thank you very much!
Bus No. 80...
Absent-minded man!
He forgets to sing once he's here...
and goes back home. It's been
happening for 10 years!
Mr. Mishra, that friend of mine I spoke
about is here. He's a great singer.
Give him a chance, sir.
It'd make his life.
Everyone who comes here
claims he's a great singer.
Does anyone say he can't sing?
When is Sonu Nigam arriving?
- Any moment now, sir.
The name is Raju. From Goa.
I want to be a singer.
Throw him out, guys!
- Relax... I want to be a singer.
Do you know, darling;
I'm in love with you.
You know it, darling;
I'm in love with you
I'd do anything for you.
What a singer!
You're fantastic!
You're a top singer!
Oh yes you are!
I'll be a singer, won't I?
- Will you?
Who made Udit Narayan what he is?
I did!
And who made Kumar Sanu's career?
I did!
And Mohammad Rafi...?
- Rafi, too?
No! He made my career!
Now quickly record your songs
and bring the cassette to me.
Isn't it the music companies
which records the songs, sir?
I'll explain this to you.
I've heard you sing.
But how's the boss of my company,
Mahesh Hirwani, going to do that?
I want your songs recorded
so he can listen to it.
How much will it cost us
to have the songs recorded?
Maybe a hundred thousand or 150,000
150,000?!
- Maybe 200,000
200,000?!
You have the talent.
You're going to make money!
200,000 bucks! That isn't money
we can find in our pockets!
My career will be finished for 200,000.
We haven't money for 2 liters
of petrol. And he wants 200,000!
I can't push this anymore.
- Get your Uncle to pay for gas.
I'll go to him. He must be angry
I haven't still gone to the shop.
We'll buy gas with the money
I bring from him.
Who's made a shop out of this bus shelter?
Hey mister... who's made
a shop out of that?
It's still a bus-shelter, mister.
A company's beautifying it.
Still a bus stop! Strange!
It looks like a shop!
That's a shop, Aba.
- It's a bus stop.
It's a shop!
- A bus stop!
Take a good look.
That's your uncle's new shop.
You look very happy.
Have you scored with a girl?
No, uncle.
- Why are you late, bloody dog!
I got held up, uncle!
But why are you eating the remains?
Remains, eh? I'll tell you.
This is a sweet-lime.
The juice in it is my principal.
Everything else in it is my interest.
And you know, I never
let go of my interest!
You've earned so much in interest.
You must at least eat well, uncle.
God is kind. I eat the remains
of sweet-lime and orange.
I used to sell sugarcane juice
when I first came to Mumbai.
For two years, I lived only
on the remains of sugarcane!
I'm glad, you didn't sell coconuts.
- Shut up!
You've turned up after lunch-hour.
You lose half your salary!
I have news, uncle. A friend of mine
from Goa is selling his shop.
What's the big deal? He isn't
giving it away for free, is he?
It's as good as free, uncle!
How much would a 20 by 10 sq. feet
space sell for at Carter Road, Bandra?
For anything between
1.5 or 2 million.
He's giving it away at 200,000!
At 200,000?
But why's he giving it away
so cheap, my boy?
He lives in Goa. How'd he know
of the prices in Mumbai?
He's selling it at Goa's prices.
By Jove!
I'm going to buy that shop!
I'm going to buy it!
Where is this friend of yours?
- Out there... must I call him?
No! Don't call him in!
Let him remain there.
I'll get some unadulterated juice for him.
Go on... Hurry up, my boy!
The miser's fallen for it.
Do you want 20,00,000 instead?
Don't be greedy. We need 200,000.
And that's all we'll take.
This is Raju, uncle. And that's
my uncle. Not worthy of any praise.
Sit down...
and have some juice.
You're my nephew's friend, after all.
My nephew told me that you're in
trouble and want to sell your shop.
Don't worry. You will have no
problems till I'm around!
I'll buy that shop!
No sweat, uncle. There was this chap
here today. The deal's almost through.
But the deal hasn't been struck.
- No! We only got talking!
No deal yet.
- And why not?
He wanted to pay me by check. I want
cash because I'm leaving for Goa.
He wants it in cash, you see.
- I see!
You can never say with these guys!
You must always get paid in cash!
I'll pay it to you in cash.
Just you come with me! C'mon!
He really doesn't deserve any praise!
Here's 200,000!
200,000? Or is it
two watermelons?
Dangerous times, you know.
I've got to hide my dough!
I put back in the fruit what
I earn from it... open it!
My word, Uncle!
If only I knew...
I'll start my new shop tomorrow and
serve you the first fruit-juice!
It's made, uncle!
The shop's got made!
Why's he laughing so much?
- He's happy, you see.
He's going to Goa and he's delighted.
Fantastic! You've got the dough!
We'll make a great cassette!
And you will be the superstar!
This is the first time it has
happened in my 17 or 18 years.
This is the first time it has
happened in my lifetime.
There's someone...
There's someone I keep
thinking about all the time
I dream of her, on silent nights.
Lost I am, in things I do not know.
The breeze blows the veil in the air.
It sets my heart racing.
Steady me, my friends
I seem to be losing myself.
Caught up, I always am, in these tresses.
Footsteps awaken me.
Why am I always chasing memories?
My heart beats in loneliness
I don't know whom it pines for.
Tell me, someone.
I want to know...
What's wrong with me?
Include my name too in the
list of the crazy lovers.
This is the first time it has
happened in my lifetime.
There is someone...
There is someone I keep
thinking about all the time.
Hey! What's up with you?
Stop dreaming!
You are the real star.
He's only shaking his leg. And the
guys are going ga ga over the girls!
You're going to be a big star!
This cassette... it's worth 200,000.
Once the music company owners listens
to it... he's going to be fantastic!
Let Misra make you star.
I'll deal with my uncle later.
How are you...?
- Okay.
Why the long face? Where's Misra?
- Up there.
Up there? Have they
built another floor?
No. He's dead.
No, Misraji! You can't
leave me like this!
This was no age for him to die!
You wouldn't have died had
you waited for some more days!
I want to die!
Deliver me, Ô Lord!
Look! There's the owner of Music
Gramophone Company... Mahesh Hirwani!
Go and see if the ambulance has arrived.
Get up... hurry!
It's okay... relax.
What's all this, Maheshji!
- He's dead... so what?
Do you know what he wanted most?
- Sure.
He wanted my company
to be at the forefront.
No?
All right. He wanted our company to
always find the money... right?
No!
- No? So what did he say?
What's he saying?
Mr. Mishra wanted him to be
a successful singer!
What?! These bloody
aspirants...
Take them away...
I wonder where these guys land up from!
Take the madcap away!
Go on.
Weeping can make you tired.
- Sure.
Why are they noting our license number?
- Must be a no-parking zone.
But when did the traffic cops
take to dressing like that?
They aren't the cops brothers, are they?
No... I think they're
those thugs!
The first check we issued has bounced!
Go on...
- I'll find a way.
What's the point in eying the bike now?
What do you mean?
- The guy who owned it is dead.
What do you mean?
- He's dead. His body's lying inside.
We'd even get the corpse
to pay us, okay? C'mon guys!
Sit!
The moment I open my shop, the
customers make a beeline for it!
That's what you get when you
have a shop on a busy road!
Thanks a million, Lord!
Let the queues continue!
Where have they gone?
They must've taken my shop
for a bus-shelter!
It's an earthquake!
Help!
Everything's okay out there...
so why's my shop being shaken up?
Somebody stop them!
Police! Police!
What's happening here?
- Stop them, Inspector!
They've squeezed my shop!
Who asked you to start a shop
at a public bus shelter?
Is this a bus-shelter?!
No! It can't be true!
This is a railway station!
There'll be trains here soon!
Have you gone mad?
- Sure! I've gone mad!
I've gone mad...!
I've lost 200,000!
My stuff is all garbage!
Stop this guy! He's the
one who has robbed me!
Stop! Where do you think
you're going?!
Get down! Get down!
Inspector! It was this guy
who sold me that shop!
Look... your uncle.
There are cops too.
Who sold the shop to you?
- Good God!
He's the one who sold it to me!
He's the one!
The bloody crook!
Get him, constables!
Go on, mister...
he's targeting everyone.
What the hell have I done...?
Forgive me...!
Get him, constables!
This guy's really gone mad!
It's my misfortune, Aba.
We've lost 200,000. And I haven't
even got to be a star.
Neither did I find my dream-girl
nor is my dream realized.
God keeps giving us those signals.
But we're fools not to notice them.
Take Misra's death, for instance.
That is to suggest that I have
entered the wrong lane.
Mrs. Godinho's back there in Goa.
I think I'll go to her.
What? You have ruined my life.
And you'll go back to Mrs. Godinho?
Very well. You had to come along
and spoil things even more for me.
There's your signal...
so go to Goa!
You've been a great support, Aba.
- And that was a mistake?
I'll give you something before I leave.
What will you give me anyway?
- The bike's all yours.
The keys belong to you. And this
cassette is for your uncle.
Those thugs will beat me up for the bike...
and my uncle will beat me up
for this bloody cassette!
Happy Diwali, fatso!
- What Diwali?!
He's only wishing you.
- I'm doomed, anyway!
Now either kill me.
Or I'm going to kill myself!
Right now!
Do you want to kill someone?
Look at this.
It's a bride.
The train's coming...
get out of the way!
Get the hell out of there!
Don't be crazy!
Leave the girl alone!
Get out, Raju!
The train's coming!
Thank God for the car which saved her life!
Take her to the operation theatre
and inform Dr. Chander. Quick!
Do you know her, sir?
- Of course.
Who brought her here?
- Her husband did.
I want you to check
this man's mental health.
He started a fruit-juice shop
at a bus shelter.
We want to know if he's really mad
or whether he's faking it.
Why have you come in here?
Please go out.
This is an operation theatre.
- Take him away.
No... I won't go out.
That's the lady's husband.
Please, doctor...
- Now look, son.
But you must go out.
- Please don't do that, doctor.
Nothing will happen to your wife.
- My wife...? Oh yes! My wife!
She's lying there all-alone!
And I've never let her be lonely.
How can I leave her like this?
Please let me be here with her.
Quietly. In a corner.
The nurse's given me a sleeping pill.
- An injection. Not a pill.
May I sit down?
What's happened to my child?
What's wrong, dear?
On the day of a festival?
How's Pooja, K.D.?
What injuries has she received?
No injuries as such.
She has suffered a head injury.
Back there... at the rear end.
Because of which she had
a brain hemorrhage.
Because of the force of the blood,
she's now in a coma.
We have conducted an operation to
lessen the pressure on her mind.
In medical terms, we call this
a state of coma vigil.
Which means, she can hear, listen and
understand. But she can't speak.
Pooja will be all right, won't she?
If only you had agreed to Pooja's
marriage with Romi, sir...
we wouldn't have had to see this day.
But Pooja is already married!
- What?
She was brought here in a bridal dress.
It was her husband who saved her.
Romi...?
- Of course.
Where is he?
Romi has risked his own life to save Pooja.
Did you... jump before a speeding
train to save Pooja's life?
I only did my duty.
- You have saved not Pooja alone...
you have saved the whole family, son.
Why only Pooja? I'd have done it
for anyone in her place.
I was wrong, son. We turned down the
match, without even meeting you.
We thought you weren't good enough
for Pooja and for our family.
I have nothing to do with what you
thought and what you now think, sir.
That's because...
- How were we to know, son...?
That you'd be the angel
to come into our lives?
Thank a million, Lord, for
sending him into Pooja's life.
Now look, ma'am. I have nothing
to do with Pooja or you.
Just please forgive me.
And please let me go.
Don't say such things, son.
I realize I've made a mistake.
That I should have at least have met you!
I should have tried to understand you.
Please forgive me, son.
Please forgive me...
- Who are you folks?
Who on earth are all of you...?
Please let me go... please!
My boss is asking for pardon. You
mustn't leave Pooja in this state!
I seek your pardon, sir!
I have enough tensions in life.
I've got to sing... I mean, go!
...how am I going to explain?!
Get this straight, my good man.
I must see Mr. Oberoi.
Maybe. But he's in the ICU after
a heart attack. You can't see him.
Damn it! Is this a hospital
or is it a prison?
Now look; I'm not keeping well.
I'm going to get a heart attack.
Let me meet him...
- Skip the drama!
Well, all right.
Here you are.
You're trying to bribe me, are you?
I'm not going to let you in at all!
What a madcap!
Make him see reason!
What are you doing here?
Go to your wife.
Look at him!
He barged into a funeral the
other day. And he's here today.
You let those two-penny guys in
and stop rich folks like me!
That chap is Mr. Bharat Oberoi's
son-in-law.
Maybe... what?!
- That's right.
Mr. Bharat Oberoi's son-in-law.
He's Pooja's husband.
Pooja even has a husband...
the jerk!
Why am I always the fall guy?
I'm not blaming you.
But why me?
I'm leaving now. Tell your folks
that I'm not Romi.
That you met with an accident and I
happened to be there to save you...
is a signal that you have
a long life ahead of you.
And make sure you drive slowly in future.
What is it now?
- I've heard what you said to her.
Have you? Then you must know
I'm Raj. I'm not Romi.
So go and tell them! Please!
- No! I can't tell them!
My boss has had a heart attack.
I can't tell him all that.
You don't think I'm a doctor, do you?
- You know what state Pooja is in.
Should I tell him that you're not
Romi... I don't know what'll happen.
Please stay back! I have seen hope
in his eyes since you have arrived.
Who are you anyway?
And what makes you so interested?
I'm nothing more than an accountant.
But I've been with him for 30 years.
He has always treated me like a brother.
I beg for his life...
Please don't go away.
He treats me like nothing, okay?
So I beg of you for my life...
I've taken enough in life anyway.
Give me a break. Please!
See?... now step aside.
Son-in-law! How are you?
- You, sir?
Don't embarrass me by calling me sir!
Son-in-law?
- You're Pooja's husband.
Why didn't you tell me you're
Mr. Oberoi's son-in-law?
Fantastic! You are
Mr. Oberoi's son-in-law!
What's fantastic about that?
It's indeed amazing,
son-in-law.
Honestly, when I saw you weeping
at Misra's funeral the other day...
I knew for sure that
it was a son-in-law...
that you have the Goddess's blessings.
What a melodious way
of crying! Indeed!
I've yet to see a son-in-law cry,
errr... sing, like you!
You are undoubtedly the
son-in-law No. 1!
And what happens to this cassette?
- To hell with this one!
I'll have a fresh one recorded
for you... just you see!
I'll give it a release so grand
that no son-in-law...
...I mean, no singer
has ever had!
So just drop in at my office tomorrow.
The son-in-law...
my Statue of Liberty!
Find Romi quickly, Goverdhan.
Brother's been asking for him.
Go ahead. I'll find him.
Romi ought to be with my brother.
That's what the doctor says.
So bring him quickly.
God Almighty... where will
I bring him from?
And what will I tell them?
Stop crying... Romi's here.
Really?
- Yes.
I thought that if playing Romi
could save Bharatbhai's life...
so why not? Saving a life
is anyway a noble deed.
You're a great boy...
Let's go. He's asking for you.
Open your eyes, Bharat...
look who's here.
I will hold something against you.
Why wasn't I born as your son?
Open Sesame!
- Hey! This is her bag.
Correction. It was hers.
It now belongs to us.
Look! Jewellery worth
half a million.
A laptop. The stuff's
worth over a million!
My life is made, Raju!
I'm shedding tears of joy!
- Don't cry. I'll return the bag.
Return it?! Whatever for?
- To steal is a sin, Aba.
I see! A sin, eh?
We conned my uncle into buying a bus
shelter as a shop. Wasn't that a sin?
We did that for my career.
- I see.
Wasn't it a sin to issue a check
for 30,000 when you had just 1000?
That was to further my career.
- Oh great! For your career!
And now that I land some dough,
it's all wrong!
Now look; I did every wrong only
for my career. And I've got my break.
Who's giving it to you?
- Know whose daughter she is?
She's the daughter of Bharat Oberoi!
And Mahesh Hirwani...?
- What's up?
Is he dead?
- He's giving me the break!
I see. He's going to die soon.
Know what Mrs. Godinho
always says?
We meet God at every step in life;
It's just that we don't recognize him.
Have you ever been drenched in the rains?
Sure. On many occasions.
- Has anyone offered you an umbrella?
Sure.
- You didn't recognize him
I did. It was Babban!
- It wasn't Babban...
It was God!
- God? Babban?
Have you ever lay there,
without anything to eat?
It's happened so many times.
- Did someone come and feed you?
Sure. The milkmaid did.
- It wasn't the milkmaid.
That was God, too.
I met God last night too.
And God gave me a break.
- I see! God has given you the break!
How could I forget to tell you?
I met God last night too.
Who?
- The one who gave you the break...
and gave me this bag!
- Hold it!
I'm going to return that bag!
- You can't take away what God gives!
God hasn't given you that bag, Aba.
You've stolen it from him.
And it's a sin to steal from God.
Give that to me, Aba.
Take it!
No! Not anymore, please!
How are you?
- I'm okay, no thank you.
How many fingers are these?
- Five, thank you!
And who am I?
- The Inspector!
Where are you, at the moment?
- In a hospital, no thank you!
Was that a bus-stop or was it
a fruit-juice stall?
It was a bloody bus stop!
Looks like he's all right, doctor.
Are you hungry?
- I'm famished!
What will you eat?
- Remains of all the fruits!
Give him some more shock, doctor.
He isn't all right.
No worry. That's the mental ward.
Such noises are commonplace.
It's day already... wake up.
Here's your bag.
It was with my friend.
You'll find everything intact. Except
5000 Rupees, which my friend has spent.
But I'll return the money as soon
as you regain consciousness.
I had told you that I would
never meet you again.
But Mr. Goverdhan has requested me
to stay back...
and play Romi till your dad gets well.
I have my interests at heart too.
I'm a singer, you know?
Mahesh Hirwani is going to
release an album of mine...
because he thinks I'm your husband.
My life is made!
Someday I will recite a song for you.
Why someday? Let me recite it
for you right now.
You must give me a big hand
if you like the song, okay?
It will laugh;
It will cry.
It will find someone;
And it will lose someone.
In solitude, it will suffer.
That's every heart in love.
Come, Romi... they're asking for you.
Has Mr. Goverdhan arrived?
- Not yet. But come on.
They want to ask you something.
What? What do they want to ask?
- Why are you scared?
I'll come after
Mr. Goverdhan arrives.
Of course he will arrive.
Now come on... C'mon!
How can I believe that you are Romi?
Give it a thought.
When the accident occurred,
Pooja was at the wheels and you...
That's Monty from America.
He's my sister-in-law's son.
And this is Romi.
I can't believe he's Romi.
Any proof?
- I am the proof.
I know he's Romi.
Pooja had once introduced me to him.
Really? When was that?
- Actually, when Pooja and I...
went to buy a computer for her,
we had lunch together. Right?
You have spoilt her with your indulgence.
You kept her secret without
telling us anything.
I thought I'd tell you when the time came.
When are we doing the recording, sir?
- We're doing it, son-in-law...
it'll be done in good time.
Just don't worry!
Don't mention his name as
son-in-law on the album.
He's kidding!
The album will have it
in bold print: Romi!
Not Romi. It ought to be Raj.
- Raj?
Your name is Romi!
- Right.
But the album will say Raj.
- Why?
Why did Yusuf Khan choose
to call himself Dilip Kumar?
Because that was a lucky name for him.
I see!
So Raj is a lucky name for you!
So we'll call you Raj.
What's the big deal?
When are we doing the recording?
- We're busy this year.
But I promise. Yours will be the
first album next year.
A year? Impossible!
I had told you, Raj. HMV promises
to release the album in 3 months.
And what did Polygram say?
- 15 days, they promised.
So let's go!
- Hold it, guys.
You guys get worked up for nothing!
Wow! You're into Moonwalking!
You're a born star!
Sit down... Go on.
- What for?
It'll require at least 8 days to...
- 8 days!
That's a very long time.
- Be reasonable, guys.
You know what a busy music composer
Anu Malik is, don't you?
He's away in Europe.
You must wait for him to return.
Besides, Pooja's in hospital.
Would it be okay...
to record it without her?
- It's Pooja I'm doing all this for.
Pooja will spring to her feet,
the moment she listens to my song.
Mr. Goverdhan!
- Congratulations!
All our tensions are over!
- They're over!
We have no problems in future!
- No problems!
Let's go and tell Bharatbhai the truth!
Here's where the problem lies.
I won't tell Bharatbhai the truth.
Why not?
- I don't want to!
Like you didn't want it earlier.
- You have evil on your mind.
No matter what. I won't tell him!
- I'll go and tell him then.
So I'll tell him!
I'll go and tell him the truth!
- I'll tell him too...
about the conspiracy you had hatched!
- What plan?
Whose plan?
- Have you forgotten what you told me?
The old man has millions!
He'll die of a heart attack.
That you'd strangle the girl and
we'd split the millions between us!
What rubbish...
are you talking!
I could never imagine you'd
be such a cheapskate!
I'm not a cheapskate!
You're compelling me to be one!
Go out... I've got to make her change.
- Okay, we're going out.
Not him. He's her husband.
He'll help me.
Go on... please.
- Listen to me!
Please pull that sheet.
She has...
She has a mole there!
- God!
Disgusting! Bloody disgusting!
I've never seen such a husband.
He shut his eyes...
when I asked him to change his
wife's clothes and grabbed my skirt!
You're an amazing man!
You aren't as rotten as I thought you were.
And you're a much better man
than I thought you to be.
You know Mahesh Hirwani, don't you?
Sure. I do know him.
What is it about?
He thinks I'm really
Bharatbhai's son-in-law.
How many fingers on my hand?
- Five fingers, thank you!
Who am I?
- The Inspector, no thank you!
And who's that?
- The doctor!
Are you hungry?
- I'm famished, I swear!
And what will you eat?
- Rice and lentil-curry. Anything!
Very good! He seems to be
all right now, doctor.
Now tell me; why did you start a
fruit-juice stall at a bus stop?
There was this scoundrel who claimed
to own it and sold it to me!
How much did you buy it for?
- 200,000!
Whom did you buy it from?
Speak up... whom did
you buy it from?
It was that scoundrel I bought it from!
It was that scoundrel!
He isn't all right, doctor!
Give him the shock!
Once the recording is over,
I'll tell them that I'm not Romi.
Know something? What would God lose
if you were the real Romi?
Are you coming or going?
I've been looking for you.
Mr. Goverdhan! It's you
he's talking to!
I couldn't tell whether he was
talking on the phone or addressing me.
I have news for you.
There was a call from Jahnvi.
Really...? That's my
daughter who called.
What did she say?
- She's returning to India tomorrow.
I want some important medicine from
the U.S. Could Jahnvi bring it?
You ought to be happy
your daughter is returning.
Jahnvi and Pooja keep no secrets.
She must surely know about Romi too.
Jahnvi and Pooja are more like sisters.
Even at home, no one has ever
discriminated between them.
They've grown up together.
Should Pooja have something,
Jahnvi too got it.
Whenever the bangles tinkle...
Whenever the anklets tinkle...
Whenever it pours...
My heart calls out.
My love, Ô my beloved.
Day in and day out, my heart calls out...
My love, Ô my beloved.
Why is there a pounding in my heart?
Why does it pine so?
What have you done to my heart,
Ô heartless one?
My sleep vanishes;
I'm restless.
The things that loneliness does to me.
My face is flushed of its color
I lower my eyes out of shyness
I feel shy, even when I look at the mirror.
Why have you made me pine...?
Why have you taken away my peace?
Whenever a boy meets a girl...
it awakens a desire in my heart.
When the bridal cymbals
are played somewhere.
Whenever they deck up
the bridal palanquin...
I go crazy at heart and yell out.
Please come with me. I have
something to discuss with you.
I'll be back soon.
- Okay, father.
Can't you see where you're going?
That's Jahnvi... my daughter.
Why does it always happen to me?
- What happened?
Nothing really... I thought
I'd run away from here.
And I ran into my life...
must I run away now? Or mustn't I?
No need to run away!
Jahnvi has never met Romi!
She only spoke to him over the phone.
Care for some tea?
- No thank you.
No... don't cry, Biji.
You mustn't cry.
Make her see reason, dad...
We ought to be happy that
Pooja's life was saved.
We were saved before something
drastic could happen.
And what's so seriously wrong anyway?
I spoke to the doctor before I arrived.
Know something? This is exactly
what happened to Superman, too.
Yes! And he's back to his
flying ways already.
All Pooja now has to do
is to simply get up.
We've taken enough of your drama, okay?
Remember? You had planned a dance
competition for us, on my return?
You were supposed to do an Indian
dance and I'd perform a Western.
I've even learnt new steps!
All right... now tell me
how's your married life?
I've penned a couplet.
Want to hear it?
I've filled up tubs with
my tears, as I remember you.
The uncouth man that you are;
You simply bathe in it!
What happened, dear?
- I ran into a madman out there.
I went to wash the cold-drink
he spilled on me.
You washed it with your tears, did you?
God protect your friendship with her.
Come, Jahnvi.
Let me introduce you to Romi.
That's Romi.
This is Jahnvi.
And you said she hadn't ever met Romi!
That's what I thought. That she had
only spoken to him over the telephone.
Have you seen Romi?
- No.
Pooja told me that he was short,
had brown eyes and curly hair.
But this chap...
In that case, you're not Jahnvi either.
Pooja told me that Jahnvi's fat and ugly...
that she's squint-eyed
and has a bucktooth.
But all that is not true.
You're very beautiful.
Get well, Pooja.
And I'll fix you!
Tell him, Biji.
It's Diwali today.
We won't be celebrating it...
but we must have a prayer.
We have to adhere to our customs.
So come over to our place this evening.
Okay?
- Certainly.
It's your place too, son.
Glory be to the Goddess of Wealth.
The Gods too pay obeisance to You.
Glory be to Thee.
My husband got this bungalow built
when my son was just 15 years old.
The prasad.
- You look beautiful.
Know what Mrs. Godinho says?
It's fun to celebrate
Diwali with your family.
Take some prasad?
- It has 150 calories!
I can't eat that!
- Go on. It's in the name of God.
All right. I'll try some.
You're calorie-conscious,
aren't you?
No wonder you have such a great figure.
Happy Diwali everybody!
Please give me a smile!
Welcome, Master. Let me introduce
you to my son-in-law.
Your son-in-law?
- Yes. He's Pooja's husband, Romi.
I've met him.
- Forget it.
I have forgotten it.
Please remind me where.
He's a singer. He's training
Pooja in classical dance.
But he has this characteristic...
he's very absent-minded.
So tell me where we have met
It'll refresh my memory.
Must I? In everybody's presence?
- Sure! Go ahead.
The Master and I participated
in a dance-contest.
He danced so well that
he dropped his pants.
Did that really happen?
- Yes... have you forgotten it?
But you mustn't forget that
he's Pooja's husband, Romi.
May I show Romi Pooja's room, dad?
- Certainly.
Why just the room?
The house belongs to him... go on.
This is Pooja's room.
- It's nice.
And where's your room?
- This is the one.
And which is Pooja's room?
- This is our room.
Didn't Pooja tell you
that we share the room?
She did. And I forgot.
So many perfumes... but why have
two of each?
That's because Pooja likes
whatever I like...
and I also take a liking to
whatever Pooja approves of.
Look at this... we even have
the same kind of cell-phones.
Aren't they nice?
But what happens if the two of you
fall for the same guy?
That's impossible.
- Why?
Because Pooja has already
approved of you, Romiji.
Don't you approve of me then?
- Well, I do.
But not in the same way.
- In what way, then?
Pooja told me that you're good at poetry.
So tell me the first couplet
you recited for Pooja.
Everyone I come across...
appears to be like you.
Looks like I'm going to go mad...
for, I'm in love with you...
I wait for you.
No wonder Pooja loves you so much, Romi ji.
What the hell are you doing?!
I didn't know your preferences
had changed so much in six years!
Oh come on! I'm pretty hung up myself.
It's her I see every place.
I find her in you, too.
- Really?... happens, I guess.
Does it really?
- Of course.
Lovers are like alcoholics.
They imagine the bottle everywhere.
But spare me and let me go to sleep.
I was dreaming about the milkmaid.
Know what...?
Will we only dream about girls?
Get up.
What's up with you?
I've got your address
with great difficulty.
What's so difficult?
This is an easy place to find.
What would you like to drink?
Let me get something.
Aba! Get up!
- Who's that?
Me... Jahnvi's here.
How about some juices?
Sorry! No juices!
That's my friend, Aba.
Greetings!
And good-bye!
- Good-bye!
Dad says you have fulfilled
his desire for a son.
He has sent you this little gift.
- Oh yes. Small guitar indeed.
What's in the guitar anyway?
- The car-keys.
What car is it?
- An Opel. It's out there.
Why's it out there?
- Because it can't be brought in.
Dad has had the left-wing of
the bungalow vacated for you.
You will live with us.
He has given me status
with all this respect.
On the other hand, he belittles me
by asking me to live with them.
Thank Dad on my behalf.
All I want is love. Your love.
And love from everyone else.
Because there is nothing I can
give you, except for my love.
Know what Mrs. Godinho
always says?
Those who possess love are
never to be considered poor.
How about some tea and buns?
Abdul! At least send for
some tea and buns!
Looks like you've won again.
I've won again!
Maybe you're lucky at both.
Maybe you're beloved is very much
with you... and you don't know it.
I don't understand.
- Let me explain.
As Mrs. Godinho always says...
God shows us the signal at every place...
but it is we who can't understand.
We meet so many people in our lifetime.
But then, we come across an individual...
whom we feel like meeting time and again.
We are happy in his company.
We are sad, when he goes away.
That's the signal then.
One of us will have to leave...
The two of you will leave.
I will stay back here. Okay?
Let Romi stay back, father.
- No, dear. He's tired.
He's tired... Go on.
- You ought to relax, sir.
The two of us will spend
the night chatting away.
