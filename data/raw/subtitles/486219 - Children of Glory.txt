MOSCOW, 1956
What?
What?
What?
The referee is blind.
We're being screwed!
We'll beat
the shit out of them anyway.
Faster! Faster!
Hey!
Hey!
Let's do the cross trick!
Karcsi, you swim across.
Tibi, you tie up your guy.
What?
What?
What??
You want this?
- That referee! What a goddamn rat!
- At least he makes a nice backboard.
They told him when to whistle. The great
Soviet team can't lose to the Hungarians.
- They can only win by cheating.
- Damn Russkies.
- They really think they're great.
- You've got to have brains to be great.
Don't you?
Just give them the trophy and
get drunk instead of playing.
- Screw'em.
- They think they rule the world.
- They do.
- Only half of it.
But they're still an empire.
You'd better get used to it.
Hungarians!
Licking your wounds?
Doing what?
Karcsi, don't!
You don't even deserve
to be defeated by us.
Screw you,
you stinking Commie asshole.
You, too.
Misha, you giant ape...
go and screw Lenin, Stalin, and
your whole stinking Commie system.
And this... up your ass.
This too.
Screw Khrushchev too...
you faggots.
Faggots?
Faggots?
Your mother...!
Watch out!!
Stop!! Stop it!!
Hurry, the coach
will be here any minute.
He's getting drunk
in the restaurant car.
Look at Peták!
He sews better than my grandma!
You take in ironing?
Sure... He uses his girlfriend
as the ironing board.
- What do you think they heard at home?
- Take a guess.
The glorious Soviet team defeated
the unworthy Hungarians.
Goddamn Russkies.
Hurry, customs are here.
I get an extra cut if I sell
this stuff, right?
Petak, you're a compulsive hustler,
you should be paying us.
Can I hide here
during customs inspection?
- What was the game today?
- Fake!
Fake... just like my fur!
Excuse me!
Good evening. Customs inspection.
Good evening.
That one.
And this one?
Why is it so heavy?
Because it's Soviet...
Their balls are bigger than ours.
Good luck, boys!
Thank you.
And him?
Sleeping like a bear.
Alright.
BUDAPEST, HUNGARY
We start tomorrow at 6 A.M.
From now on it's: "Olympic Training."
- What's tomorrow?
- Olympic Training!
- There they are. - You take
the barrel, I'll take the stick.
Switching at half-time, right?
There's no place like home!
Hi, I'm Karcsi.
- I know who you are.
- I don't think so.
I'd remember
a beautiful girl like you.
Comrade Szabó!
Come with me, please.
Who are you?
The minister would like to meet you.
He is a big fan of yours.
Couldn't this wait until tomorrow?
Bring your bag, too.
Can I come? I'm on the team too.
Doesn't the minister want to meet me?
Let's go, Comrade Szabó.
Pest control.
There are disturbances in Poland,
things like
that spread like the plague.
But if we kill a couple of rats,
the rest will run away.
- This is not the ministry.
- That's right.
Come in!
Karcsi Szabó, as you requested.
Karcsi! So glad to meet you.
I'm a big fan of yours. Sit down.
May I offer you a drink?
No, thanks.
Coca-Cola, ever tasted it?
I'm sure you have.
You travel enough.
It's only unique for us here.
Have some real American gum...
Go on, take one, Karcsi.
I can call you Karcsi, right?
You just call me... Uncle Feri.
What have we here?
The famous good-luck watch?
Say something.
You don't need to be afraid here.
We like people like you.
An outstanding athlete who takes care
of his family. You have a bright future.
So why do I hear strange things
about you?
You were a bad guest in Moscow,
you hit a Soviet player.
He started it.
Unsportsmanlike, true...
but you hit him back.
And that "incident"
with the referee...
Never, under any circumstances...
Look at me!
You should never, under any
circumstances, strike a Soviet comrade.
Is that clear?
And you never insult our Soviet
friends by saying: "Screw Khrushchev."
I hope you understand... finally.
You understand what you've got to lose.
You, your family, your little brother...
His name is Józsi, right?
- They let you go?
- Who?
Tibi said the AVO took you in.
He's always talking nonsense.
- The minister just wanted to congratulate me.
- Tibi said it was the AVO (Secret Police).
I'm here, right?
Everything's fine.
Karcsi, are you awake?
No. I'm fast asleep,
I can't even hear you.
- What are you thinking about?
- Why you're not letting me sleep.
Karcsi! Are they going to
put me in an orphanage?
What did you say?
If the AVO takes you away?
What are you talking about?
There's this girl, Vera, at school,
they arrested her parents,
and she was put in an orphanage.
No one is taking anyone.
Not me, not you, no one.
Promise?
I promise.
This is Radio Free Europe,
the voice of free Hungary.
In Poland, protesters have demanded
better living and working conditions
and the correction
of prior injustices...
Karcsi!
The AVO took you in... right?
They told you
to let the Russians win.
No, grandpa.
Then what did they want?
They said we should never
hit the Russians back.
How did they threaten you?
With us...? Our lives?
Good night, grandpa.
Karcsi!
Sometimes you must hit back,
even if you're not supposed to.
The strike continues
in the city of Posnan...
The news about strikes in Poland
is completely fabricated.
The whole story is false capitalist
propaganda to disturb law and order!
Our Communist brothers in Poland have
stood up for the Soviet ideals.
I want to say something!
I'm here on behalf of the Independent
Student Alliance of Szeged.
- Shut up!
- They are lying to you!
- We don't need any new ideas...
- Let me go!
We want to show solidarity
with Poland...
We can't allow confusion.
I have the right to speak!
Let him speak!
Let's hear what he has to say!
We have the right to hear
the student from Szeged!
No interruptions!
This will have serious consequences!
Let's hear the Szeged
student's representative!
University students! Hungarians!
The message from Szeged is that:
They're lying to you here! They are
fighting for their freedom in Poland!
Form your own revolutionary committee
and pledge solidarity with Poland!
Keep treading, guys!
- Where's Tibi? - We haven't
seen him since the station.
- He left with two girls.
- Two? He can't even handle one.
- What did the minister want?
- He sends you love and kisses.
Sorry, coach!
- What happened to you, Tibi?
- It's just a black eye.
Whose wife was it?
Yours! But she wasn't very good.
Go change.
- They didn't even beat you up?
- No.
They offered me Coke and gum.
You Commie pet...
They beat the shit out of me,
and they pampered you?
So much for Socialist equality.
Was it the AVO?
Three of them.
That made it a fair fight.
Tibi, they know everything.
What we talk about,
our family, everything!
Don't shit in your pants,
we're important to them.
Let's go find some girls.
I can't, I have
to go to the university.
For what?
Even if you stay dumb,
they'll kiss your famous ass.
There will always be polo and girls,
who cares about anything else?
I have to go,
Imi's got my report card.
You're choosing that nerd over me?
Imi is a good guy.
- Take care.
- You too.
We've just formed the
Independent Students' Alliance.
We demand free general elections,
a new government
headed by Comrade Imre Nagy!
Imi! Imi!
Karcsi!
A new daily paper for the Alliance.
And free radio...
We formed the ISA!
What?
Independent Students' Alliance.
Karcsi, we're independent!
When they kick your ass out of here,
then you'll be independent.
The Stalinist functionaries
must be dismissed immediately!
We demand a pardon for the
victims of all political trials...
They can't shut us up!
We have the right to voice our
demands until they understand...
Who's that?
...that we don't want to go on
living like this! - That's Viki.
The Poles showed us how to be brave.
- Let's go to the Bem square...
- Why haven't you introduced me?
You're not her type.
We want a peaceful march tomorrow.
There's no such thing.
And if we do it right,
the whole city will be with us!
Clap or I'll kick your ass!
For a chick like that, anytime.
We must write a manifesto.
If anyone wants to add
to our 14 points, speak up!
- We want our national flag back!
- That's right!
Hey, listen!
Why don't we tell the Russkies
to go home?
Russkies go home!
Russkies go home! Russkies go home!
Russkies go home?
You're out of your mind?
They're going to leave
if we stick together.
- It will take more than a couple
of students. - Imi!
Here are the flyers.
Hand them out.
- Karcsi, help us.
- I have to go to training...
- You know... the Olympics...
- I know you.
I don't think so.
I'd remember a girl like you.
You're a coward,
who doesn't want to get involved.
- I don't think you know me at all.
- Take some for your team?
Why should he risk his privileges?
He's the pride
and joy of the Commies.
Those beautiful lips
should be put to better use.
- Hand these out and come back if
you need more. - See you later!
- Are you going to help?
- I can't, she was right.
They'd kick me off the team.
Come to the Bem statue.
See you at the Bem statue.
- My balls are all shriveled up.
- Now they match your dick.
- It feels like an icicle.
- The girls in Melbourne will defrost it.
Come to the Bem statue.
At the Bem statue.
See you at the Bem statue.
CALL FOR A GENERAL STRIKE!
Tonight, we're
moving to the Red Star Hotel.
Say goodbye at home. From now on
I'll be kissing you good night.
See you at the Bem statue.
At the Bem statue.
- The students are out of control.
- I like girls out of control.
It will all blow over by tomorrow.
The Ministry
bans all public demonstrations.
What should we do?
Go on! Let's go on!
Rákosi in the river,
Imre Nagy to power!
- For freedom!
- Thank you.
In the interest of law and order,
the Ministry
prohibits public demonstrations.
Russkies go home!
Russkies go home!
Wait! Stop!
Viki!
Viki!
Attention! The Minister has
lifted the ban on demonstrations.
Do you hear this? There's
too many of us. They can't stop it.
The comrades are weak.
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
- I'm not here... for you.
Why not?
You don't know what I'm like.
Here. Carry it.
See. That's what you're like...
- I didn't say "no."
- You did, with your eyes.
There must be something between us,
if you're looking into my eyes.
Yeah, it's called aversion.
And what do you see now?
You're scared because the ÁVO
is taking pictures from the roof.
You have no idea what's going on here!
Go back and play water polo.
If they spot us here, we'll get thrown
off the team. No woman is worth that.
We demand the immediate withdrawal
of all Soviet troops from Hungary.
A new Party Congress must be called
and a new central committee elected.
The people have expressed their solidarity
with the Polish independence movement.
Karcsi!
I knew you'd be here.
Ever seen anything like this?
Sure, at all our games.
We demand freedom of speech,
free press and a free Radio!
That's right! Hurray!
I told you we can make it happen.
Do you really believe that a
demonstration will change anything?
It already has! Can't you see?
This is a miracle.
...a new government
headed by Imre Nagy!
Hurray!
- You gonna introduce me to Joan of Arc?
- She's taken.
- You gonna marry her?
- I might.
I bet you I'll kiss her before you.
You'll lose as usual.
- Isn't Imre Nagy a Commie?
- Yeah, a little bit.
Couldn't they
find someone who isn't a Commie?
At least he wants reforms.
Are you still here?
Let's go to the Parliament building!
We want Imre Nagy!
Right! Right!
Give that to me. I'll carry it.
- Are you coming to the Parliament?
- I wouldn't miss it.
Do you want to give
a speech from my shoulder?
- You must be a water polo player too.
- Tibi Vámos. The heart and soul of the team.
- The mouth... to be more accurate.
- Viki Falk.
Talking about mouths...
You deserved that.
- What did I do?
- I don't know... yet.
If they take a picture of you
with the flag, you're off the team.
You... I'm hidden by the flag.
Rákosi in the river,
Imre Nagy to power!
- Why do they want to throw Rákosi in
the river? - Because he is a tyrant.
But my teacher said that
he's a great friend of the people.
You don't have to believe everything
they teach you in school.
Take it down!
Take it down!
- Hi, Karcsi!
- What the hell are you doing here?
Grandpa wanted to show me the revolution.
- This is history.
- No, this is just a demonstration.
- Stalin's statue has been knocked down.
- Grandpa's going to let me pee on it!
- Grandpa, don't take him there!
- Let him hear Imre Nagy speak.
Is she your girlfriend?
He's gonna marry her.
Does mom know?
Never.
Why not?
Really... Why not?
Why did the lights go out?
- They just want us to go home.
- No way!
Imre Nagy!
Imre Nagy!
Karcsi, look, it's like a starry sky!
Comrades!
Why are they booing?
- Because we're not comrades anymore.
- What are we then?
- Free people.
- I'm just sleepy.
- I admire the youth of Hungary...
- Viki!
Come to the Radio
to broadcast our demands.
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
Without common sense, we may
destroy our democratic achievements.
- We're coming too!
- No! You're not.
- You'd better go home.
- But I want to go with you.
It's late.
Look, this is for you.
And watch out for grandpa.
You know what he's like.
...let's all go home in peace.
???
What happened?
Damn ÁVO promised
to broadcast our demands...
instead, they arrested our delegation!
Let our delegation go!
Hold this in front of your mouth!
Let's take over the Radio!
- Let's take over the Radio!
- Let them go!
Let's get
out of here, they're all animals!
- None of this makes any sense.
- Sure it does!
This is the beginning of our lives!
Goddamn ÁVO! ÁVO pigs!
Damn it.
ÁVO pigs! ÁVO pigs!
Imi!
Everything will be all right.
It's all right.
They aren't doctors!
They're ÁVO! Watch out!
Imi! Look at me.
Imi...
Come on!
Come on!
How long have you known Imi?
He never talked about you.
He told me about you.
You took him rowing...
Rowing?
Where?
I don't know.
I wasn't paying attention.
I don't remember either...
It shouldn't have happened this way.
Why? What did you expect?
They allowed the demonstration.
The only thing
that's permitted here is silence!
- That's exactly what we must change.
- How? By demonstrating?
By cutting up flags and watching
people get slaughtered?
- It shouldn't have happened like this.
- Is that what you're going to tell Imis mother?
Her son died for our freedom.
No! Her son died because he got shot
by a machine gun...
he believed he could change things.
He knew what he wanted. He said
this was the best day of his life.
No, he said this was the beginning
of our lives, that's what he said.
Forgive me.
I know how Imi's mother must feel.
My parents were killed by the ÁVO.
There was a time
I wanted all the ÁVOs dead.
Killing is their method...
Not mine.
And what do you want now?
I don't know... anymore.
I just don't want to be alone.
You're not alone.
I am talking to you at a difficult
time. The Central Committee...
of the Hungarian Workers Party has
appointed me Prime Minister.
Did you hear that? It's Imre Nagy!
Imre Nagy is the Prime Minister!
Does that mean it's over?
Viki, come on!
There's fighting all over the city.
- We just heard, Imre Nagy is Prime Minister.
- You think the Russians care?
Karcsi Szabó, he's with us.
You're going to fight against tanks?
- I don't want to, but we must.
- Are you coming?
- Come on!
- I've got training.
- Training?
- I know you think it's stupid...
but I have a dream too,
and it's not getting shot to pieces.
I see.
Good luck!
Viki!
Martial law has been declared.
The government
has requested the intervention
of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary.
Ours is the politics
of reconciliation, not of revenge!
Therefore anyone who voluntarily
puts down their weapon
will not be court-martialled.
Too much static.
Imre Nagy says
to put down our weapons.
Radio Free Europe
says we shouldn't trust him.
- We need more guns.
- Do you know how to use them?
Sure, just shoot at the Russkies.
Show me.
Safety off first... dummy.
Loading it is not a bad idea, either.
Colonel Marián is giving weapon's
training in the courtyard.
No one touches any guns
until they learn how to use them.
Aim your weapons!
All together, fire!
Fire!
Go ahead, take it!
We don't know how to write demands or
fight, but this is our way of helping.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Pass these out.
Make sure the injured get some.
Taste's good.
This too.
Where have you been?
Everybody is asking me questions.
- I wasn't supposed to be a field marshal.
- We had to make a detour. The streets are blocked.
And we said a long goodbye
to a polo player...
Wait... what
happened with the polo player?
Nothing.
And... what's going to happen?
Nothing.
Where the hell have you been all night?
I walked Viki home.
- The coach is ranging like a bull.
- We're training here...?
If you can call it that. The only
water in this hole is in the toilet.
- Was there really shooting at the Radio?
- Only Karcsi. He shot his load.
Was she any good?
Imi is dead.
They were killing people everywhere.
Anything else you want to know?
Szabó! Come here!
Where the hell have you been?
Sorry coach,
there was trouble in the city.
When I say six at night,
I don't mean noon the next day.
What are you looking at? This is
not a puppet show. Back to practice!
I don't want to hear about any trouble.
If I do, I'll have to kick you off the team.
So... finally...
- the revolutionary shows up.
- What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?
- You're gonna screw it up for
the whole team! - Are you crazy?
Hey!
Stop it!
Separate them!
Maybe we can't even go to the Olympics.
With bodies all over the streets,
who cares about the Olympics?
- I do.
- Yeah. Me, too!
- I haven't worked all these years for nothing!
- How can you train without a pool?
We are locked up in this shit hole.
Listen guys, we
have to focus on the Olympics.
It's bad enough that we can't train, but
I'm not going to let you kill each other.
What's wrong with you? All we
talk about is the Russkies leaving
- and now everyone shuts up?
- Enough!!
If this revolution is so important
to you, why don't you just go back?
- You're right, I'm going.
- No one is going anywhere!
I don't care
if World War III breaks out...
I won't let the world's best
water polo team destroy itself.
Sorry coach, I'd stay, but
just to sit around... No thanks.
- Listen, Szabó.
- Karcsi, don't go! - Szabó!
If you walk out that door,
you're never coming back.
All right. Calm down.
We'll put Karcsi's dick on ice...
and everything will be okay.
Karcsi!
Karcsi!
Let me out!
Let him go.
On behalf of the revolution, we demand
that you hand over your weapons!
We've been expecting you.
If you sign a statement that you
forced us, we'll bring up guns...
and grenades from the basement.
Thanks.
Come on!
POLICE STATION
Here, this may come in handy.
Thanks.
Karcsi!
Karcsi!
I'm from the Military Academy...
we have formed a Revolutionary Council!
We brought weapons,
where shall we put them?
Stop shouting... you're scaring me.
Second, thank you.
Put the weapons over there.
Hi!
- I'm looking for Viki.
- You're the polo player, right?
- With whom there is nothing going on.
- She said that?
But this "nothing" has been
preoccupying her lately.
- Karcsi Szabó.
- Eszter Hanák.
- You want a rifle or a guitar?
- What?
- A machine gun. It plays beautiful music.
- How do you know about these?
My father was a game keeper until
he was fired by the Communists.
So... which one?
The guitar.
Help me!
How come you're here?
Did they let you leave?
I didn't ask permission.
You left the team?
Don't worry about it.
- Karcsi, don't do this just for me.
- It's not just for you.
Then why?
My grandfather says that
sometimes we must hit back.
This is one of those times.
Come with me. I want to see
if everything is okay at home.
Let's take them some food.
Those who used arms
against the state
have a few minutes left
to hand over their weapons
and avoid court martial.
Fascist forces have attacked...
our public buildings and police force.
To restore order
all forms of public assembly...
Karcsi, where have you been?
- Mother, let me introduce...
- What is that?
- Don't you dare bring those in here!
- We'll leave them in the hall.
Can I have a look?
Have you used it?
Don't touch it! Are you out
of your mind? Bringing guns home.
Mother!
This is Viki Falk.
- Good evening.
- Mrs. Szabó.
He's going to marry her.
One more surprise and I'll have
a heart attack.
- We've brought you some bread.
- Thanks!
Go on in.
Józsi, hang up their coats!
- Józsi! Dinner!
- Coming!
How are we doing out there?
Our numbers are increasing.
The police and the military
are joining us.
The Russians are better armed.
Do they have tanks?
Yes, but they are not invincible.
That's the way to do it! You've
got to show those damn Commies!
Don't encourage the kid.
How did you get involved in this?
Why aren't you with your team?
There's no training now.
And the Olympics?
No one knows what's happening...
Then stay home. The radio said if you
stop fighting now, they'll forgive you.
Forgive us?
What are you thinking?
You are not going to achieve anything
with guns and demonstrations.
Is this our country or not? We've got
to kick the Russians out on their ass!
Can grandpa say "ass"?
Viki you should know better.
I don't have a family.
We've got to get back to the university.
I just wanted to see how you're doing.
No! There's a curfew.
Besides, there's
shooting all over the city.
Both of you are staying here.
I came to get a blanket.
Is that you?
Yes. That's when...
Tibi and I decided to win the Olympics.
My mother sewed the flag.
I've never been to a water polo match.
I'll take you.
You'll love it.
I was eight when my father
took me to my first match.
My strongest memory of him,
is his crying when the Hungarians won.
That's when
I decided to play water polo.
And now... you've left the team.
Its just a game.
At least for now.
- But you didn't tell your mom.
- Shhh! She might hear you.
What's wrong?
There's something I haven't told you...
When the ÁVO arrested my parents,
one of the men offered...
to let them go if I had sex with him.
He lied!
If you don't want to be with me
I understand.
Excuse me.
I washed your shirt,
but the blood stain didn't come out.
Thanks. You didn't have to.
I'm sorry I was rude last night.
Mothers can be like that.
I understand you.
What you're doing is important.
Especially if you have
no one and nothing to lose.
Get dressed, I won't disturb you.
Good morning.
The time is 7:30.
Today is October 25, 1956.
The weather will be cloudy...
Now the news...
The curfew has been lifted
between 6 A.M. And 6 P.M.
But all schools remain closed.
Excuse me, miss.
Where are you
taking those two monsters?
- Do you want one?
- I don't believe in guns.
I'm Father Balázs.
I didn't know priests
were taking part in the revolution.
The Lord prohibits me to bear arms
but not to love my country.
If the Lord would care,
we wouldn't need guns.
Guns can't change the world,
only love can.
You'll see.
Where is everybody going?
To the Parliament, they're hoping
to hear from Imre Nagy.
He's just screwed up over this girl.
How did you get the coach
to let us go?
I told him we needed to
get our passports.
He has no idea
we're going to see Karcsi?
Sure he does!
That's why he let us go.
She got dressed, left
and no one saw her?
- Calm down, it's better this way.
- What did you tell her?
- What did you say to her?
- Just the truth.
That your place is on the Olympic team.
Karcsi...
- Where are you going?
- I've got to find Viki.
I thought that was yesterday's news.
There's no one
who likes sex more than I...
but what's that got to do
with the Olympics?
You go. Win it for me, too.
We can't win without you.
You'll screw up the whole team...
especially me.
I've made my decision.
Just accept it.
You idiot, your life is in danger.
They know everything about you.
The Parliament, the Radio, your gun.
How do you know?
If you stop now, they won't bother you.
You're important to them.
What have you done?
Let's just leave.
We have to get to Melbourne.
- What the hell have you done?
- They threatened to throw me off the team.
Water polo is all I've got.
- Did you join them?
- Yes, I joined. Everybody joins.
These people are everywhere...
at the university...
in the store, on the street,
everywhere.
In this country
everyone's a snitch.
But you, Tibi?
You of all people?
It's easy for you.
You're the best. The favorite.
But who am I?
A nobody.
The son of a drunk,
who they can kick out at any time.
What did you tell them?
- Nothing...
- What did you tell them?
Nothing important. But if you
go with her, you're finished.
- Go ahead and tell them!
- Stop!
Come with me,
we can own the world.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Because of a woman?
No, because this is my country...
and I'm not the one who should leave.
That's what this is all about.
- Wait, Karcsi.
- Take your hands off me!
Hello.
Viki!
Viki!
What are you doing
on that Russian tank?
They've been stationed here
for years, they like us.
If the Russians are with us
then who is against us?
Viki!
Viki!
We are free!
We are free!
