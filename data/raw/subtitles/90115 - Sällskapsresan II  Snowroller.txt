Most parts of the town is owned by the Katz family\nand is therefore usually called "Katzberg".
-The Church we call the "Cathedral".\n-The family's mightiest man is doctor Katz.
He is a specialist in bone fractures.
When we are a bit mean\nwe call him "Plastercat".
-He owns most of the things in this town.\n-Crack pays - bone cracks I mean...
I hope no one gets into any\n"catastrophe" so you have to meet him.
For you beginners they have\nEuropes best ski school.
Then I can go train in ski school.
To avoid damages\nskip the first run in the morning.
-And skip the last run...\n-Every day!
Giggles\n-What does he mean?\n-It was a joke.

When I was a kid\nI could inherit my brothers...

You don't get agoraphobia\nin your ski pants then?
-Can you really trust them with that?\n-He knows what he's doing.
With these new boots the\nbone fractures are less complicated.
The bone cuts straight where the boot ends.

It's said people that are afraid of flying are really afraid of something else.\nIt's not flying you fear.
Your mind creates a feeling you can easy get\nbut the real reason is something completely different-
-like a dominating mother.
I'm sorry\nI'm standing here and having a lecture.
-My name is Lotta.\n-Stig.
30 kronor (4$) for only us four!\nNEVER.

I brought some flowers and\nand a German-Swedish dictionary.
Mum will get ski lessons from a guy that have\nbeen Swiss number one in downhill.
Rudi from Katzen hutte you know.\nHas promised to ski with me... a little.
-Now when you can't.\n-He is very cute.
It's a little less foggy now.\nI will crawl out and see.
Watch out.
-You know...\n- Yes??
It's a strange glacier crack.
Both laughing
Good that it was not to bad.
-What the h*ll...??\n-Cheers colleague!
-And there we where on the roof.\n-Here you go.
My ladies and gentlemen\nlets take the first small glass.
and let it down in the big glass.
Then we get whats called "submarine"!\nCheers!
You can also drink it with vodka and\nthen it's called "Russian submarine".
English\n-Hi Algy!\n-I though I lost you forever up there.
-Is there room for us?\n-Sure.
Take a submarine!
Stig H Olsson - what a looser! (also meaning garbage)
Maggie! Hi sweetie.
But Stig...! What are you doing?!
I need to lay a tender on Lotta\nso she can get away from those super nerds.
-It's sad that she is such a girl.\n-What girl?
Always need to talk and\nshow here feelings.
-She is pretty.. now when she got some color.\n-That is what makes it so sad.
IN GERMAN: \n-Uta bring more sauerkraut from the basement!\n-Yes herr Katz.
GERMAN\nHi Bernhard. It's Rudi.\n-Yes I can hear that. How are you doing?
Bernhard this might sound a little weird\nbut I would like to ask you for a favor.
You have a patient whose name\nis Joensson - a Swede.
-Yes he can go home today.\n-I usually don't ask for favors...
They mixed up your X-rays with someone else\nthey have to remake the band aid.
But you don't need to pay for this\n- it's all free of charge.
Rudi invited me for lunch today.\nDo you think I should say yes?
-How nice! In the Katzenhutte?\n-Yes.
-We will go with a sledge from town.\n-How romantic!
-Should I tell your dad?\n-Yes he has to tolerate that.
-No let it be a secret.\n-Lets do a "I gonna Rudi".
SINGING:\nTutti Frutti - I gonna Rudi...
-Hi. How are you?\n-Good.
What a nice color you've got. If you want\nI have some spare time to ski with you now.
Okey? But I'm unfortunately a little busy today.
The whole gang have a slalom race this afternoon.\nI think it will be nice.
-It would be nice if you came.\n-I have a really a lot to do today.
Then we put some design on and\ncall it vibration limiters.
-And call it the "Swedish ski"?\n-You can't be stupid - like Hedlund.
-Hi grils. This is Felix.\n-Hi Felix.
-He will take the picture.\n-The Photo!
-You're not skiing?\n- In "Norrland" we only do "flat skiing".
It's only people from Stockholm\nthat go downhill.
We can take the picture over there\n-it's better light there.
ENGLISH:\nAstonishing.\nIt's a Swedish invention - "a kick".
Try to look happier.\nIt's cool skies you're holding.
Unbelievable ugly skies!
What nice anorak you have! I have looked\nfor one of those old ones with markings.
-Is it second hand?\n-No it's my old one.
Everyone calls you Stig H.\nWhat does H stand for?
-Harald or Hugo or...?\n-Helmer - after my grandfather.
Lotta laughing\nHelmer...?
That is crazy - look!
But god! I would give anything to hear what they say.
I'm sure he's whispering sweet love words\nin her small shell shaped ears.
GERMAN:\nThe heating Ventilation and Sanition system is not capable enough.
There is always problems\nduring high season.
My husband Goethe...\nis working in the HVS-business.
Maybe he can have a look at it.
Meatball also. (Humor from the Swedish Disney Christmas tradition)
You are so cute!
But I think Ferdinand is cuter.
"Why don't you play\nwith the other bulls and butting you too?"
"I enjoy it better here\nwhere it's calm and pretty" -
-"and now I will smell the flowers."
"Kiss me - I'm Norwegian. " Okej.
I like old stuff\nbut do you need to have such a ugly hat?
-It's my grandfathers old bandy cap.\n-That does not help.
And she took of his glasses...
... ruffled his hair...
...and all of a sudden he transformed\nfrom a teacher to a sex bomb.
-Kiss me!\n-No!
Oh Helmer!
-Poisonous right? (means cool)\n-At last do you take it from here?
-Have you been skiing gates before?\n-Hi Lotta. Fun that you made it here.
You can't be "unloyal" to\nthe group. - Right Helmer?
-Hejsan. Can we get two beers?\n- Sure.
SPEAKER VOICE:\nTime for Snowrollerchampionship.\nFirst run is Sara and Niklas Joensson.
Ready steady go!
Sara is in the lead.
But the most important is not to win\nbut to be the first in goal.
Now you get your ugly cap back.\nMaybe it'll give you luck.
-Good luck.\n-Thanks you too.
What do you think about Lotta?\nShe is very lively.
She seem to like you and you\nmaybe need something to wake you up.
Next couple is Lotta Modin\nthat will compete against-
-Alrernon Wickham - Twistleton -Ffykes.\nIt looks even.
To bad Alrernon.\nWe need to get a bigger finish line.
We have tricked Braennstroem and\nHedlund to compete but they don't ski-
-but they ride garbage bag.
It's tremendously exciting.\nLook what style!
But what happens? Hedlund breaks.
Applause for the winner Braennstroem.
How is the shape Olsson?
Next duel is between Stig H Olsson\nand my colleague Nalle.
Olsson I will give you a handicap.
Ready steady go! Both of them\nstart of good - it's even.
It's very even! But there it seems\nlike Stig H got to much back weight.
Oh shit!
I can fly I'm not afraid.
A CRASH
