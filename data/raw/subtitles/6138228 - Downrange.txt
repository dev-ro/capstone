Jeff was the other guy's
name, right?
I feel like shit
because I couldn't remember.
He said that this was a lot
of vehicle for a couple.
I told him I used it to
haul around my band equipment.
That wasn't true.
Um...
Sarah got pregnant.
We don't know how it happened.
<font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLES)</font>
We were always so careful.
It was scary, but we decided
to start a family.
So I sold my bike...
my car.
Put it up against

Bought a...
baby seat and...
crib.
Went all out.
I just really couldn't
help myself.
<font color="#ff00ff">(LAUGHS)</font>
And then, uh...
We, uh...
we went in for, like,
her umpteenth ultrasound.
There was no heartbeat.
There were no signs, no, um...
no symptoms...
no warnings.
Just... nothing.
Just here with us one second,
and then... gone the next.
It's really nice out here.
