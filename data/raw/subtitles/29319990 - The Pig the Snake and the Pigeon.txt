CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION
Fuck.
He said NT$500, but there's only NT$300.
Who are you with?
I'm with Boss Black from Wanhua.
Understood.
Sorry about that.
Boss Hung always had a good reputation.
Today is his funeral,
so of course it has to be grand.
If your boss kicks the bucket,
we'll also go to Taipei to show support.
Please help us out.
Who are you with?
Boss Black from Wanhua.
Apologies.
Appreciate it.
Appreciate it.
We have pork chop and soy-stewed pork.
They are both really good.
You're with Boss Black too?
How many people came today?
If not a thousand, at least 800.
Haven't been to such a big event
in a while.
Boss Hung sure loved extravagance.
That lunatic really came up from Taipei
to whack him.
Who?
They call him the "Kuilin Kid".
Kuilin Kid?
I'm telling you.
He might be a lunatic,
but I think he's pretty awesome.
You know him?
The Kuilin Kid
is a young gun from the streets
of Zhongshan District.
Two months ago,
Brother Nine won
NT$8 million at Boss Hung's casino.
Boss Hung wouldn't pay up,
so Brother Nine told Kuilin Kid
to go collect the debt.
You know what happened?
What happened?
Turns out, Kuilin Kid brought a grenade.
A grenade!
Once he got there
and collected the NT$8 million,
he blew up the casino.
Killed Boss Hung. Isn't he cool?
- Cool.
- Right?
But he may have shot himself in the foot.
Now that Ironhead has issued a kill order,
it looks like the odds
are against Kuilin Kid.
Hi, grandma.
What is it?
Did you get the money I sent you?
It's not too much. Just a few grand.
Okay.
I will be away for a while.
Going overseas for work.
- Remember to eat.
- Ironhead is here!
I'll talk to you later.
Ironhead!
Ironhead is here.
My name is Goldie.
Let's go back to Taipei together.
I'm Chen Kui-lin.
I have a real name.
Stop calling me Kuilin Kid.
- Go.
- Okay.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
FOUR YEARS LATER
Okay...
I'll be over shortly. Okay.
How much time left?
Half a year at most.
Worst case scenario, three months.
Will Iressa or Tarceva help?
It's too late.
What about the new drug, Giotrif?
Does your hospital have that?
Look at this lung. It's all white.
It's probably too late.
Lung transplant?
Kuei-ching.
You're a doctor too.
You should know what the situation is.
Your grandma is in trouble.
Get here quickly.
Ms. Chang, what took you so long?
The doctor's been waiting for you.
What's your relationship to the patient?
I'm her doctor.
You're her doctor?
She has an 18cm tumor inside her ovary.
Did you know that?
She just had a CT scan.
Her abdominal cavity is severely bloated.
She needs surgery right now.
I need a signed consent form.
The nursing home won't do it.
You're the only contact
we could to get in touch with.
So please sign the form.
Or does she have other relatives?
Make a decision now.
If her life is in danger during surgery,
do we resuscitate?
Do we intubate?
We'll follow regular surgery procedures.
If necessary, we will resuscitate.
No intubation.
Doctor.
Please, no intubation.
SURGERY IN PROGRESS
What are the chances of success?
Do you want her surgery to be successful?
If it is, will you be able
to take care of her?
After a few days in hospital,
she still has to
return to the nursing home.
You finished school?
Mommy is still working.
You eat with Daddy first.
How did it go?
{\an8}The accident was between
a truck full of eggs
{\an8}and a cash transport vehicle.
{\an8}After the collision,
eggs covered the ground
{\an8}as NT$1,000 bills scattered everywhere.
Police are urging residents
who took the bills to return them
to their nearest police station
as soon as possible,
emphasizing that keeping the cash
constitutes misappropriation
of lost property.
Residents are advised to
turn themselves in and not test the law.
- According to reporters...
- The money
you told me to give Grandma over the years
has never been used.
Except for this watch
she bought last birthday.
NT$300.
I can't believe the last time I saw her
was four years ago.
How long do you plan to
keep running and hiding?
I had been really worried.
Worried that seeing news of my capture
would break Grandma's heart.
But now that she's gone,
I'm going to do something big,
so every criminal in the underworld
will know who I am.
There's something
I'm not sure if I should tell you now.
The report is out.
You need to be mentally prepared.
{\an8}What does that mean?
{\an8}Stage 4.
Lung cancer.
Terminal.
Are you sure?
Any treatments?
Lung transplant?
It's too late.
How long do I have?
Six months at most.
Worst case scenario, three months.
Stop smoking.
What difference does it make?
Don't you know?
Lung cancer gets very agonizing
towards the end.
Rather than dying like a street rat,
you could act more honorably.
Do what's right.
At least die with a little dignity.
You want me to turn myself in?
Go find me another lung.
{\an8}Excuse me, Ms. Chang.
{\an8}What do you want?
{\an8}Granny Hou from Lucky Nursing Home
passed away today.
{\an8}Did you know her?
{\an8}Who are you?
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION
She had a grandson,
Chen Kui-lin.
Do you know him?
Never heard of him.
Never heard of him?
You were in her contact book.
What's your relationship with her?
I'm just a pharmacist.
I sometimes deliver medicine
to nursing homes
and check the residents' health
while I'm there.
Anyone could have my number.
Let me know if you hear from Chen Kui-lin.
CAPTAIN CHEN HUI
Dear Holy Emperor Guan.
This is your worshipper Chen Kui-lin.
If Emperor Guan
would like me to surrender,
please give me a sign.
Put the money in and get your ID ready.
Won't be long.
Get everything ready.
- Lots of people today.
- Put them in the bag.
Sir.
Please don't block the door.
Sir.
I'm Chen Kui-lin.
Mr. Chen.
If you're turning yourself in,
get your ID ready and go over there.
I'm turning myself in.
You and everyone else.
There are procedures.
Don't block the door.
Follow instructions.
Go over there. Hurry.
Go line up.
- Get your ID ready.
- Go this way.
Everyone, this way.
Easy. We're all in a hurry.
Quickly get in line.
THREE MOST WANTED FUGITIVES

NO. 2 HSU WEI-CHIANG AKA HONGKIE
NO. 3 CHEN KUI-LIN
Don't run. Slow down.
Yu-yu.
They were just saying they didn't see you.
- But you're here.
- Yu-yu's mom.
Give me the ball.
Come...
He says he's hungry.
- We have sandwiches here.
- Here.
- I bought lots.
- It's okay, I'll go buy one.
I'll go buy one.
What do you want?
It's nice to have a family.
How old is your son?
Tell me what you want.
Do you know Hongkie?
What Hongkie?
Operation Fox Hunt over 20 years ago.
Standoff with police
at Xinyi's Wuxing St. apartments.
I heard Xinyi Police Department
used up all their ammo.
He was shot multiple times.
You must have helped him.
What are you doing?
Where is he?
I need to speak to him.
Do you know why you can stand here
and talk to me right now?
If I were a snitch,
you'd already be in prison.
Must be a good drink.
Give it a try.
There's a miracle doctor in Tainan.
I'll take you to see him tomorrow.
I'm not afraid of death.
I'm afraid of being forgotten after death.
Can you do me a favor tomorrow?
What did you do?
What did you do to my son?
The other day,
I passed the police station.
I suddenly remembered what you said.
Rather than living like a rat,
I should turn myself in with dignity.
So I went.
But it was then that I realized
I'm not even qualified to turn myself in.
Turns out I don't have enough value yet.
This is my value.
You know the story of Zhou Chu
and the Three Scourges?
People only remember Zhou Chu,
but never the
two other monsters Zhou Chu killed.
That's why only Zhou Chu has value,
and why people remember him.
I'm a dying man.
Help me one last time.
Where is he?
The first time I met Hongkie
was over 20 years ago.
It was the day of the Wuxing St. shootout.
At 10:00 p.m.,
a few underlings carried him in,
asking me to save him.
One bullet was lodged in his head.
I didn't have
any surgery equipment with me.
I wouldn't dare operate even if I did.
That bullet
is still stuck in Hongkie's head.
He has headaches almost every day.
I can only prescribe him some painkillers,
which someone fetches for him every month.
Who fetches his medicine?
Okay.
Okay, I understand.
For about 10 years now,
a girl named Hsiao-mei
has been getting his medicine.
She was only a teenager back then.
I know nothing about her background.
Her name is Hsiao-mei?
Cheng Hsiao-mei.
Cheng Hsiao-mei.
Let me take a photo.
One, two, three, yeah.
Your son sure loves ice cream.
It's not good for his teeth.
You kidnapped him
and you're worried about his teeth?
Where's Lin Lu-ho?
He disappeared a long time ago.
Over a decade ago,
he sent a letter from here to his mom.
This is her reply.
KAOHSIUNG ELDERLY CARE CENTER
YANG SHU-CHEN
I've told you everything I know.
Where's my son?
I'll tell you once I see Cheng Hsiao-mei.
Mom!
Mom, it's so heavy!
Are you hurt? Let me take a look.
No.
Would you like a room?
Any vacancies?
NT$850 a night.
Don't get it from Rat Ming next time.
But his stuff is so cheap.
- What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.
That Rat Ming
was trying to haggle over every cent,
so I stabbed him a few times.
Want me to put on some ointment?
I'm fine. No big deal.
You want your headache pills?
No need.
Clean this up.
So? Anything to eat?
Pig blood cake, duck blood,
deep-fried sandwich.
Let's go for a smoke.
What were you laughing at?
Nothing, boss.
I asked you what were you laughing at.
Sorry, boss.
Something must have made you laugh.
If you give me a reason,
maybe I'll understand.
But not saying anything really hurts me.
It means
you have dirty thoughts
you don't dare to say.
How many bottles have we had?
Six.
Finish this to make it seven.
Give it to me.
Enough.
Enough.
Close up.
Go clean up your face. Hurry.
What are you eating?
I got some stuff delivered
to your mom today.
Prison rules are so annoying these days.
Soup, frozen foods,
pig blood and duck blood are all banned.
Even coconut and passionfruit.
Coconut I understand.
You can kill someone with that.
But banning passionfruit makes no sense.
How can you kill someone
with a passionfruit?
Choke them to death?
Don't worry.
I'll get my people on the inside
to look after your mom.
Captain.
Chang Kuei-ching's call records.
They're mostly calls to her husband,
but two other numbers popped up recently.
One is a SIM bought
from a convenience store.
The other is a shop in Taichung.
What kind of shop?
A hair salon.
Hsiao-Mei's Hair Salon.
The sun is out in south-central Taiwan.
People in these areas
will start feeling the heat around noon,
when temperatures reach 30-31 degrees.
It will get much colder at night
in central regions.
In the south,
the temperature gap remains large.
But tomorrow's temperatures...
Excuse me.
Are you here for a haircut?
Please go inside first.
Do you want a cut or a shave?
Shave.
Just a trim or shave everything off?
It's okay. Let's trim a little bit,
and you can decide from there.
Okay.
Please wait.
You don't look like you're from Taichung.
I'm here to see friends.
When was the last time you shaved?
A couple of days ago.
Your growth hormones are impressive.
That'll do for today.
Thanks.
How many times do I have to tell you?
The two sides need to be even.
Sir.
Do you understand Cantonese?
A little.
How about I fix it for you?
Sure.
Go upstairs and fetch my liquor.
Not many come in for just a beard trim.
You're quite unusual.
I've got a friendly catch-up,
so I thought I'd get a trim.
Your friend owns a store around here?
No.
We're just meeting here
to have a meal.
Is it a guy
or a girl?
Both.
Junior high classmates.
So you're staying here tonight?
If it gets too late tonight,
I'll head back tomorrow.
Got a place to stay?
Shouldn't be too hard to find one.
You just arrived today?
What was that?
You just arrived today?
Yeah.
But how come
I feel like I saw you last night?
Really?
Weren't you staying at the hotel
across the road?
You were spying on me all night,
yet you still pretend?
Mister.
You got the wrong person.
Did you come to see Hsiao-mei?
Who are you to her?
Who owns the car outside?
- Please move it.
- What's going on?
There's a car blocking the street.
- Move it now.
- I will, don't worry.
We just stopped for a minute.
Sorry...
Move the car, quickly.
- I'm moving, can't you see?
- Hurry up.
What the fuck are you doing?
Buying cigarettes.
Hurry up.
Drive.
Don't come again.
Do you know that guy who came in today?
No.
That guy
was not who he said he was.
Meeting with friends?
He was looking for trouble.
Really?
I've decided.
I'm going after Rat Ming.
Steal his product while I'm at it,
then go into hiding for a while.
In Kinmen.
Why?
I've said it many times.
You can't stay in one place for too long.
Besides, the cops
will recognize me sooner or later.
Is there a reason you want to stay?
No.
- Let's have hotpot next time.
- Let's drink.
That was quick.
Shopkeeper.
Check.
- Wait...
- Fuck.
Shopkeeper, check.
Wait...
What's going on?
I thought Boss was done.
Stop!
What's your name?
Chen Kui-lin.
Do I know you?
Tell me why.
Tell me why.
- You want to stay or go?
- Go.
If the cops come for you,
tell them I killed Hongkie.
Why?
I want everyone to know I killed Hongkie.
Why?
Do you have any other family?
Hongkie was my only family.
You married him?
My mom married him.
She's serving time for Hongkie.
Second-degree drug trafficking.
15-year sentence.
NT$15 million fine.
It's a debt I'll never be able to repay.
Why?
Because she wants the whole world to know
she trafficked those drugs.
Why?
Because Hongkie
rescued her from another man.
Where are we going now?
You can keep this car.
Will we meet again?
You're free now.
Take care.
{\an8}There was an execution-style shooting
at Taichung's Hsiao-Mei Hair Salon
{\an8}and a nearby beef noodle soup shop,
{\an8}resulting in the deaths of three men.
An additional shooting victim was found
not far away in an abandoned greenhouse.
Police believe the killings
may be related.
Investigations have revealed
that one of the deceased is the
notorious fugitive nicknamed Hongkie.
A young woman was also kidnapped
during the incident,
but managed to escape early this morning.
According to the woman, surnamed Cheng,
the murder suspect is also a fugitive
by the name of Chen Kui-lin.
Four years ago,
he committed a fatal shooting
before disappearing.
Could his reappearance
indicate a bigger gang conspiracy
behind the scenes?
Police are reviewing surveillance footage
and pursuing the suspect.
Excuse me, is Yang Shu-chen here?
What? Who?
Her.
Yang Shu-chen
died three years ago.
The cost of her cremation
had to be paid by the government.
These were her belongings.
Please check them.
{\an8}NEW SPIRITUAL SOCIETY
One mistake can lead to
irreversible regret
Forgo greed, anger and delusion
to become a new person
{\an8}PENG 14 TOWNSHIP ROAD, HUXI TOWNSHIP,
PENGHU COUNTY
This is plain congee, vegetables,
tofu, and bamboo shoots.
Enjoy.
This morning,
I went shopping at the markets
with two brothers,
where we met an old lady.
She asked me,
why does she feel like
she's toiled her entire life,
yet still has nothing?
I asked her,
what's wrong with having nothing?
What do you think?
Isn't it good to live without a purpose?
Purpose is invented by man,
so it must surely relate
to worldly things.
Blindly pursuing worldly desires
is a foolish thing.
Greed,
anger,
and delusion
are the roots of all suffering.
These are all life-wasting poisons.
So, looking back,
perhaps the meaning of life
is to have no meaning at all.
I once wandered aimlessly
On the dark night road
The gentle breeze pricks my soul
Unable to find the right direction
The journey of life
Requires how many tears to complete?
Do I have a horizon to look forward to?
Your Holiness, I finally got to see you.
I'm so happy.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.
Your Holiness.
Your Holiness, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Your Holiness, thank you.
Is completed by my yearning and your smile
You can open my door to freedom
This kind of medicine
is used for treating lung cancer.
Your Holiness.
You're awake.
How do you feel?
You just vomited black water.
Did you know that?
There's something unclean inside you.
What's unclean?
There are some things you can comprehend,
and others you will never understand.
But don't worry.
Get some rest.
Everything will get better.
There's a class at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Come if you have the energy.
ASSEMBLY HALL
I was once
a terminal cervical cancer patient.
Every day felt like a countdown.
I never knew when
death would come for me.
I'm very thankful to His Holiness...
for enlightening me.
His enlightenment
is more effective than any surgery.
Because of him,
I have become a brand new person.
Right now,
I am very healthy,
without need for any medication
or any treatment.
I hope Your Holiness
can enlighten me again
and bestow a child upon me.
We have all forgotten
that we are our best doctor.
All the medicine in the world
cannot compare to your own enlightenment.
I once wandered aimlessly
Only by letting go of attachments
can one become a brand new person.
The gentle breeze pricks my soul
Unable to find the right direction
Your Holiness.
You seem much better.
There's still hope for you.
Come, sit.
This book is for you.
Read it in your spare time.
Who wrote it?
I did.
So you wrote it?
I wrote the words,
though the one
who inspired them is not me,
but someone else.
Why did you come here?
I'm looking for someone.
Who?
His name is Lin Lu-ho.
You're a cop?
I'm not a cop.
Then you must be a gangster.
I was entrusted to give something to him.
I must hand it to him myself.
This is who you're looking for.
Perhaps he doesn't want to be remembered.
When did he die?
A long time ago.
I think he was a fugitive at the time.
Constantly on the run.
He ended up in Penghu.
I was a doctor on the island back then.
I received a call at 2:00 a.m.
telling me there's a patient in the ER,
covered in blood,
and they asked me to come in.
Sir.
What happened?
Don't save me.
I'm a sinner.
I don't deserve salvation.
It was God's plan
for me to meet you all here.
Tonight,
I shall be buried here.
I saw my grave,
and I also saw your graves.
I saw the moment the universe was born.
I saw my life,
and I also saw your lives.
He knew all of our names,
where we were born,
and at what age we will die.
He was an extraordinary person.
In the end,
he instructed us
to find a spot in Huxi Township
and establish the New Spiritual Society,
to free all sentient beings
from suffering.
Perhaps,
you hold some grudge against Lin Lu-ho.
But if you don't let go
of your attachments,
your death will be near.
Will I die here?
I don't know.
I can't make you live forever.
I can only treat your illness.
A person's death
is always the result of their own actions.
Every time I say a line,
you repeat after me.
I thank heaven and earth.
I thank heaven and earth!
I thank my parents.
I thank my parents!
- I'm a sinner.
- I'm a sinner!
I have harmed the world.
I have harmed the world!
I let the world down.
I let the world down!
I'm willing to abandon everything.
I'm willing to abandon everything!
- Forgo fame, fortune, and power.
- Forgo fame, fortune, and power!
- Give up money and material possessions.
- Give up money and material possessions!
Return to my true self.
Return to my true self!
I'm heading over.
You said you had to give something
to Lin Lu-ho.
What is it?
His mother's ashes.
You knew his mother?
You said you have terminal lung cancer?
Yes. Stage 4.
Stage 4.
But from what I can see,
it's not as serious as you say.
Based on this X-ray,
I can't confirm that you are stage 4.
This shadow here
could be cancer cells,
but a biopsy would give us more certainty.
There's also these white parts.
Signs of calcification.
This is recovering tissue.
If you say
you had stage 4 cancer before,
that means your cancer cells
are self-destructing.
How could you... rip up my X-ray?
You ripped it.
Does that mean he'll recover?
That's...
hard to say.
Such miracles aren't impossible.
But it's very rare.
I think we need to observe for a little
longer before reaching any conclusions.
Your Holiness.
- I made this especially for you.
- Please sit.
This is Lin Lu-ho's mother's ashes.
This is the money I brought with me.
How much money is in here?
NT$1 million.
Put it inside.
Any money in bank accounts?
It's all here.
Put your watch in there too.
Not this.
My grandma left me this.
I know it's not easy letting go
of worldly possessions.
If you are still hesitant,
it means the timing is not right.
That's okay,
you can take it all back.
Serve the food, and give this to Pao.
Okay.
Did you come here by yourself?
No, I came with my mom.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
- This is yours.
- Thank you.
Welcome.
Senior sister.
I'll get another serving for you.
- No need, I'm fasting.
- Okay.
Thanks.
Let me know if you're hungry.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
Where do you think you'll go when you die?
Heaven.
How do you know you'll go to heaven?
Because I'm good and don't do bad things.
Do you often hurt small animals?
No, I love small animals.
- Do you eat shrimp?
- Yes.
- Fish?
- Yes.
Shrimp tastes better than fish.
Pao!
Pao! Pao, are you all right?
Pao, what's happening to you?
- Let me have a look.
- What's happening?
- Pao...
- Should we take him to the hospital?
Ma'am, please calm down.
Let His Holiness take a look.
- Get him to the hospital.
- Flip him over.
Let him lie down.
Get him to the hospital.
Perhaps he ate too quickly.
Is he okay?
He's fine.
Hospital.
Hospital.
Hospital.
Hospital. let's go to the hospital.
Close the door.
You put too much in his food.
Me?
- It was the same as always.
- He's a kid.
Kids don't require such a big dose.
Why did you interrupt His Holiness?
You're responsible
if anything happens to this kid.
Get out.
Your son has a chest infection.
You can see this shadow here.
It might be pulmonary edema.
And you see these white areas?
It may be an infection or pneumothorax.
How is that possible?
He was perfectly fine before.
Does your son
have any history of chronic illness?
No, he's always been in good health.
He's just not very sharp.
How could this happen all of a sudden?
It's very strange.
This isn't something
that develops in a few days.
Your Holiness.
Please have mercy.
Please save my son. I beg you.
He just vomited black water.
There's probably something
unclean inside him.
I'll take care of it for you.
Don't let him die.
Okay.
But don't let him recover either.
I want to keep him like this forever.
Can you do that?
I made this especially for you.
Please sit.
Now put your passbook and stamp inside.
And your debit card?
These are all vanity possessions.
And the ring on your finger.
This is my wedding ring.
I don't have anything left.
This is all I have.
You are doing this for your son.
It's this kind of obsession
that led to your husband's
premature death.
If you don't repent now,
the next victim will be your son.
Go get ready first.
Thank you, Your Holiness.
Every time I say a line,
you repeat after me.
I thank heaven and earth.
I thank heaven and earth!
I thank my parents.
I thank my parents!
I'm a sinner.
I'm a sinner!
I have harmed the world.
I have harmed the world!
I let the world down.
I let the world down!
Pack your things.
Go get your son.
They can't help you.
- Get lost.
- Take it.
Take it.
Get your son out of here!
Go get him!
Get your son!
Demonic forces are messing with your mind.
Compassion in the wrong place
will only hurt yourself.
Go!
Go. Go!
Your compassion and indecision
will only lead to catastrophe!
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Go.
Go!
Full of karmic obstacles.
A harm to the world.
Send them to hell together.
Look at his white wings
Dazzling and flawless
Our ordinary souls
Follow closely and shall not fall behind
This journey of life
Is completed by my yearning and your smile
You can open my door to freedom
-Hold my hand
-Hold my hand
-Brand new person
-Brand new person
YANG SHU-CHEN AND SON
I have a gift for you.
Do you think it's a boy or girl?
I keep saying I have cancer every day.
Luckily,
none of it is true.
I was once a terminal
cervical cancer patient.
During that time,
every day was like a countdown.
I'm very thankful to His Holiness
for being willing to enlighten me.
Love
is God's greatest gift to us.
We've all forgotten that
we are the best people.
Lin Lu-ho.
Lin Lu-ho.
Nickname, "Bullhead".
Committed more than 50 shootings.
Killed six police officers.
That's you.
A natural disaster
or an earthquake
can kill countless innocent people.
Do you hate the heavens?
Do you hate the earth?
All we do is kill a few more people.
What's the big deal?
Right?
Talking tough
even when you're about to die.
You truly deserve to die.
I asked for a sign from Holy Emperor Guan.
That day,
he gave me nine divination sticks.
If the next nine bullets in my gun jam,
I'll leave.
If not, then it's God's will.
It's God punishing you
for playing with people's lives.
I once wandered aimlessly
On the dark night road
The gentle breeze pricks my soul
Unable to find the right direction
I'll give everybody one minute.
Those who choose to stay
will end up like him.
The journey of life
Requires how many tears to complete?
Time is almost up.
Ten,
nine,
eight,
seven,
six,
five,
four,
three,
two,
one.
Our ordinary souls
Follow closely and shall not fall behind
Hey.
I'm already on the boat.
You should've come with me.
It's a four-hour ride.
You have to pick me up later.
It's so pretty outside.
Let me borrow your phone.
Sorry.
Your friend can't talk right now.
Sorry about that.
Chen Hui.
Don't come any closer!
Chen Hui!
Chen Hui!
Thanks for your help.
Chen Kui-lin, over here!
Chen Kui-lin, over here!
Do you regret it?
My name is Chen Kui-lin!
Chen Kui-lin!
Get in.
Okay, get in.
The gangster murder case in Taichung
finally has a new development.
After killing the fugitive Hongkie,
Chen Kui-lin has struck again today.
The crime took place in Penghu,
at a spiritual center in Huxi Township.
What happened to you?
You're on the news every day.
You must be happy.
I had a health check when I arrived here.
The doctor told me
I never had lung cancer.
I started thinking these last few days.
Could it really be a miracle?
Did Lin Lu-ho really heal me?
If you had lung cancer
and suddenly recovered,
then that's a miracle.
But if you never even had it,
it's just superstition.
So that X-ray
wasn't mine.
That was my lung.
Why?
The day I got the report at the hospital,
my college classmate told me,
"Kuei-ching, you're a doctor too."
I suddenly felt so ashamed.
What have I been doing all these years?
Helping all you gangsters
extract bullets,
stitch up knife wounds.
Was I saving people or harming people?
I initially wanted to accumulate
some good deeds
by tricking you to turn yourself in.
I never thought
it would turn out like this.
But come to think of it,
I did kill three birds with one stone.
I accumulated my good deeds,
you became infamous,
and society has three less criminals.
Isn't that a good thing?
I'm glad I fell for it.
Perhaps,
it was the world's most useful lie.
Not this.
Not this either.
Not these two.
- Is that all?
- That's everything.
These are all banned under the rules.
Warden.
Take a look at this.
This is mine.
It's old, blunt and harmless.
Please allow it.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Chen Kui-lin asked me to give you this.
