A SHOCHIKU PRODUCTION
A BUNGEI PRODUCTIONS-
NINJIN CLUB COPRODUCTION
Back in Tokyo.
It's been three years.
It makes my head spin.
What on earth is this?
Why are so many people
crammed into cage-like boxes?
People...
such strange animals.
What are they living for?
Their faces are lifeless, dead.
They're desperately
pretending to be alive.
Why make such a big deal
about slaughtering
one of these dumb beasts?
I served three years for it.
This is my turf.
I didn't hesitate
to come right back.
It's a strange feeling.
Somebody died.
But nothing has changed.
I'm sure it's the same there too.
Place your bets...
Muraki!
When did you get out?
- This morning.
Have you seen the boss?
- Yeah, I went by the office.
- You did?
You served a tough sentence.
Thank you.
I see nothing's changed.
But why should it?
Place your bets...
No game on this deal.
We have a player.
Five...
and four.
Ah, Muraki.
When did you get out?
Place your bets...
Here!
We have a game.
Eight.
Six.
- I'm done for.
She won again.
- I'm out.
- What about my cab fare?
Welcome back, sir.
Place your bets...
All bets in place. Last call.
We have a game.
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Shut up.

You really took a beating.
That was brutal.
Almost like you took over
her losing streak.
- Does she come often?
- Five or six times now.
She's always a high roller.
But she won big for the first time
tonight, thanks to you.
- Where's she from?
- Nobody knows.
I was there the first time
she showed up.
Just sat down one day.
Been there ever since.
Not bad, huh?
- Who introduced her?
- I don't know.
She looks too innocent,
but the boys are getting interested.
- She gamble anywhere else?
- I don't know.
Next game's Friday.
- Are you interested?
- In what?
- Her.
- Don't be an idiot.
- Want a ride?
- I'll walk.
I found a great place
while you were inside.
Packed with babes.
See you.
Who is it?
When did you get out?
When?
Let me see your face.
Nothing's changed here either.
We had to mortgage the shop.
Is your old man any better?
He got a little better last year
but then had a relapse.
He can't move
and spends all day in bed.
My brother somehow
keeps the shop going.
Think he's gonna die?
He's probably awake now,
but he's so senile,
it's hard to tell.
The sooner he dies, the better.
How long has he made you
sleep in the shop like this?
Eight years.
Ever since I was 15.
You still hate him?
I may have been his stepdaughter,
but I was still his child.
He's a beast.
And my dead mother...
she knew.
He's no father.
He's an animal. A pig!
That first time...
you and I went
to that movie theater...
you gave in so easily.
In the darkness
we were like pigs too.
I love you. I really do!
I feel like going up to see him.
- Why?
- I don't know myself.
Your skin's so dry and rough.
You have to take care of yourself.
Hey, Muraki.
What's going on around here?
I ran into some guys
from the Yasuoka gang.
Something seemed off.
- Off?
They were smiling at me.
You haven't heard?
I guess not.
We made a deal with Yasuoka
while you were gone.
When was it?
Six months after you killed
their guy Kijima.
Things are getting complicated.
There's a third party in the picture.
The Imai gang from Osaka
is gaining ground.
Our boss and Yasuoka realized
we had to modernize.
The only option was to join forces.
Sudden Gale is in top shape.
That lead horse belongs
to the Yasuoka boss.
- He's taking a solid lead.
- This is an old man's pastime.
The less his own body can move,
the more watching his horse run
becomes his only pleasure.
What's the word on Muraki?
I hear he got out.
I was planning
to bring that up over dinner.
That horse isn't looking bad today.
A truce is a truce.
We'll leave Muraki alone.
But he got off easy.
Place your bets...
Welcome.
Hi.
You're done playing?
I see.
My name's Saeko.
They call me Muraki.
Devil's tongue and fried surimi.
How much did you lose tonight?
- Three and a half.
- Your betting's out of control.
So is yours.
My friends say
I'm still not very good.
Is that right?
It's no fun anymore.
- What isn't?
The stakes are so small.
I'm losing interest.
I don't care if I win or lose.
You know anywhere
they play for higher stakes?
How high?
Thirty or forty.
Any games like that around?
- Yeah.
Take me to one.
Will you?
I'll think about it.
I could probably arrange it.
You coming to the next game?
Where can I reach you?
At home?
Of course not.
- I'll come to your place.
- Fine by me, but -
- Would I be intruding?
No.
Drop by in four or five days.
I'll do that.
Thank you.
So what do you want?
Someone's looking for a big game.
Know of any?
Sure... but can you vouch
for this person?
Yes.
- What sort of a player?
- It's a woman.
A woman? An amateur, then.
That's right.
But she's definitely
a different breed.
- Some white bitch?
- No.
And she won't make trouble.
How much to buy in?
The more the better.
A million or two at least.
- Muraki of the Funada gang?
- That's right.
Who do you think you are?
- I'll kill you!
- We'll teach you a lesson, kid!
- Out of the way!
- This isn't a show!
Sorry that happened on our turf.
You all right?
Who was that kid?
You know him?
- Nope.
- We'll make him talk.
Pong.
- I've got a pong too.
- Pong everywhere!
Not quite what I expected.
Let's see here.
I hope this goes through!
- Wait a sec.
- Hurry up.
- I win.
- What?
One... two... three... four -
full points!
Lucky bastard!
Welcome.
Muraki, how's your wound?
It's fine.
I heard your attacker
was Jiro from the Yasuoka gang.
He had some nerve.
The boss wants to see you
at the dentist's.
- The dentist's?
- The Suzuki clinic.
His bad tooth's put him
in a foul mood.
- The boss is in love.
- What?
I hear Dr. Suzuki's a hot number.
Just another moment.
Yasuoka sends his apologies.
I understand it was his guy Jiro.
I guess you've heard the news.
The Imai gang is moving in,
and Yasuoka promised
to forget about what you did,
so I decided
to join forces with him.
I'm sure you still have
some hard feelings,
but lie low for a while.
Business was tough
while you were away.
I'm sure you understand.
Yeah. Excuse me.
Just a minute.
Weren't you having your teeth
worked on before you went in?
- Yes.
- That's perfect, then.
Doctor, could you see him next?
Why'd you get off here?
Was it something I said?
I know I'm not very good at this.
It doesn't come naturally,
and I'm sorry.
But ever since
you joined our company,
life has seemed worth living.
It's the truth.
Why are you retreating
inside your shell like this?
Can't we have dinner?
I have to go.
Miss Furuta...
Did you sleep with anyone
while I was gone?
Something about you
seems different.
You're making me mad.
It's okay if you did.
There's someone
who wants to marry me.
A decent man
who works in my office.
Marry him...
while you still can.
You really think I could?
No. I love you.
Who are you?
Well?
What do you want?
I cut off a finger.
The guy you killed
was like a big brother to me.
I had to kill you!
And it was a chance
to rise in the gang.
Idiot!
But I bungled it.
Why the finger?
I'm told there's a reason
I shouldn't kill you.
Anyway, you can have it.
May I come in?
Did you find a game?
Where?
- The Tsunamachi Club.
I'll take you.
You'll be there as my guest.
Day after tomorrow
at 11:00 p.m.
How much can you bring?
The more the better.
Let's see.
How high have you played?
I couldn't say.
What's it feel like
to bet a million?
Probably no different.
But I do know that you or I
wouldn't let it show.
I wonder.
How about
a little game with me?
Since that first night I saw you,
I've wanted
a private game with you.
- The stakes?
- Up to you.
I need money for the big game.
I don't just want to watch.
Whatever you're planning to raise,
I'd be happy
to relieve you of it right now.
You're a tough one.
But I lost.
You really love to gamble.
Why is that?
Why do you?
Why?
There are no whys.
I'm so bored with life.
What's this?
- A finger.
A finger?
A man's little finger.
Shall I give it to you?
I just thought
you might keep it for me.
Why do you do what you do?
You went to prison
for killing a man, right?
Yeah.
A crime like that -
It was no crime.
Far more ordinary than that.
I had no reason to stab him.
It wasn't about honor,
or duty, or saving face.
I killed a man
I had no reason to kill.
It was just a matter
of whose number came up,
whose turn it was.
But at the moment I killed him,
I knew it was the only way
I could survive.
As I stabbed him, he said...
"You don't have a wife and kids."
I really hated him right then.
But when I stabbed him,
I felt more alive
than I ever had before.
Did you feel happy?
I suppose so.
And now?
I play cards.
What else is there?
Isn't there some decent way
for people to live?
Ask anyone: I'm no good.
Even I think so.
I'm the scum of the earth.
I have nothing in common
with ordinary society.
But still...
I forgive myself.
I know.
No matter what others say,
I forgive myself too.
My name's Muraki.
I'm here to see Aikawa.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
Follow me.
Place your bets...
It's been too long, sir.
This is a friend.
This is Boss Mizoguchi.
Have a seat.
Mizoguchi,
a most unusual guest indeed!
Place your bets...
Cards are in play.
Five and four.
As planned,
we'll now change games.
- What's next?
- Matched draws.
Dealer holds 20.
- You know this game?
- It's okay.
I'll manage.
I'll open.
Betting is open.
Betting is closed.
I'll open.
Betting is closed.
Four. No match.
Don't touch the cards.
He lost.
I'll open.
Betting is open.
Betting is closed.
She got me!
We've witnessed something
quite unexpected tonight.
I'll open.
Why so quiet?
Open your eyes.
What time is it?
2:30.
I wish the sun would never rise.
I love these wicked nights.
It's an unusually nice day.
Certainly is.
When's your baby due?
In two weeks.
That's great.
How's it feel
to finally have an heir?
I'm past 50.
I can barely go out in public
from the shame.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
No, but I'm feeling my age.
You and me both.
All I want is a quiet life.
Exactly.
I'm getting fed up with Imai.
He's moving in
on the Cliffside Club,
trying to set up shop
on our turf.
Finally making his bid, eh?
Yasuoka, Western
table manners are different.
Bring the spoon to your mouth.
Like this?
What's the Cliffside's manager say?
He's playing it safe.
Won't commit to anything.
Any room to negotiate with Imai?
Almost impossible at this stage.
Shall we move first?
I'll negotiate with Cliffside.
- I see.
Making amends?
It's all right.
The past is past.
In fact, why not let
Muraki handle it?
He might welcome the chance.
THE BLUEBIRD CABARET
The boss has really
taken a liking to her.
He wants her to come again.
I've never seen a broad like her.
Who was the new guy?
- Which one?
- Hunched up in the corner.
Oh, that was Yoh.
Half Chinese, from Hong Kong.
The boss picked him up
in Yokohama.
Carries a dagger cane
and an automatic. Fast as hell.
Fled Hong Kong last month
after killing two people...
though some say they saw him
five years ago in Tokyo.
No one knows who he really is.
A real creep.
That ghostly face
would curdle anyone's blood.
You must have noticed.
- Noticed what?
It's the drugs.
Only dope addicts
have that creepy color.
He isn't a real yakuza,
just some sleazy amateur.
The boss likes having him around,
but he's bound to get
out of control one day.
Excuse me, Muraki.
I heard from the boss.
- What is it?
He wants us to handle
that showbiz deal.
So suddenly?
What's he want us to do?
We're to call on Akira Matsuyama.
- Who's that?
- The imitation George Chakiris.
- Who the hell's George Chakiris?
- Come on!
All you need to know
is that he's the top-selling singer.
Not my line of work.
But won't it feel good
to stand in for the boss?
- No.
- Don't be such a drag.
- Still not done?
- In a minute.
There's a ring I want to buy.
It'll sell if I don't hurry.
Just call them.
Good idea. That'll do it.
So his schedule isn't
the only reason he won't perform?
That's right.
You see,
our president is from Osaka.
I'm sure you can
understand his position.
- Liar!
- That's enough.
I wish you'd reconsider.
I don't want to seem ungrateful
to Mr. Funada,
but the pressure from Osaka
can't be ignored.
I understand that.
And should there be any trouble -
You needn't worry about that.
As for money, just name your price.
Your generosity
really puts me in a corner.
Well, think it over.
Place your bets...
He bothers you, huh?
Those eyes of his...
I hate them.
That guy Yoh isn't like you.
He's not a decent type,
but he could be fun.
- I'm a decent type?
- That's right.
It's hopeless.
That Yoh...
doesn't even realize
how reckless he seems.
Everything about him says
he doesn't give a damn.
That's one way of looking at it.
That's one way of living.
Is it true he's a drug addict?
Have you ever tried dope?
- No.
Why not?
I hate drug addicts.
Why?
They're a bunch of cowards.
Why?
They can't pull their own weight.
Really?
Is everyone supposed
to pull his own weight?
Enough. Anyone strong enough
to control how much they take
wouldn't start using it
to begin with.
I don't like you talking like this.
I saw you the other day
at the hotel.
Meeting a prospective husband?
Looked like it to me.
I haven't seen Saeko
in a while now
because I haven't had
the money to play.
This guy's been here
every day recently,
eager to play for pocket change.
At least it keeps me occupied.
What are you
so lost in thought about?
I just rolled a drunk for this.
This is all the cheap bum had.
I want you to have it.
I don't need it.
You keep it.
- I offered it as an apology.
- Apology?
I realized what a fix you're in.
I heard that our boss said
you're twice indebted to us.
First for killing Kijima,
and then for my finger.
That's not why I cut it off.
The boss sees everything his own way.
- Enough!
"Don't let your mouth
be your ruin."
Sorry.
Anyway, apology accepted.
I'm such a dimwit.
It wasn't your fault.
I'll take good care of your finger.
I can't make it tonight.
Why not?
The boss is sending me
on an errand.
You're not angry
about the other night?
No.
You going alone anyway?
I hear your showbiz deal
hit some stupid snag.
That's right.
I wouldn't sell Muraki short.
He's a gutsy guy.
Knows how to get things done.
Yeah...
we can depend on him.
But we have to prepare
for the worst.
Killing Imai is out of the question.
Wonderful weather we've been having.
Great day to be out fishing.
Wanna go to the Oga Peninsula?
- Oga?
- In Akita.
The striped beakfish are biting.
We could fly out there,
stay a couple weeks.
In the meantime,
Muraki can settle things.
I'm not interested.
What makes you so jittery
all of a sudden?
What makes you so fearless?
Hello, boss.
Having trouble, I hear.
His manager Goto
is a real swindler.
Yeah, sorry it's taking so long.
Why don't we shake things up?
I heard there's a woman involved.
Goto's mistress.
Works at the Blue Star.
If he won't give in,
we could have his wife meet her.
If that works,
they won't say anything more
about the schedule.
Here's cab fare.
See to it tonight.
Boss...
tonight's a little tough.
- Oh?
Fine. Make it tomorrow.
- I need some money.
- How much?
Five.
Fine.
I'll open.
Betting is open.
Betting is closed.
It's a six.
Raid!
Quick!
- Who's there?
- Sorry to bother you.
We're here investigating.
- Gambling?
You knew?
No, but I used
the bathroom earlier...
and heard
what sounded like gambling.
What kind of inn is this anyway?
Please forgive the intrusion.
Want to talk our way
through a hand?
- Okay.
- I'll open.
Pine and peony,
one and six.
I bet 10,000.
What have you got?
Sorry about the raid.
The boss sends his apologies.
Don't worry about that.
We've picked a new location.
We hope you'll come again.
Give my apologies
to the young lady too.
Must have been quite a shock.
And it made you lose face.
I said not to worry.
Please tell her
she's welcome anytime.
I'm afraid I've lost contact with her.
The gang's
been having some trouble,
so I haven't
been gambling much.
I hear she hasn't been either.
Really? That's too bad.
It really feels different
when she's around.
More people show up.
She's so full of life.
Even me -
I love watching how she plays.
There's something different about her.
If I see her, I'll bring her along.
Maybe Yoh would know.
Yoh?
I mean...
I heard recently...
that some of our boys
have seen them together.
That night I had a dream.
Muraki!
Muraki, wake up!
- What is it?
- Tamaki's been killed!
All I know is he was knifed!
Morning, boss.
Reiji, go cut these up.
First of the season.
Give everyone a slice.
Sabu, how'd the bike race go?
Well, sir...
Hello?
Is that you, Yoshiko?
It's me.
You busy today?
Where?
Well, first a hotel,
then a movie and dinner,
then back to the hotel.
What do you say?
A dinner party?
Turn 'em down!
Just kidding.
You need to earn all you can.
Actually, I'm pretty busy myself.
Okay, see you.
Help yourselves, boys.
Thanks, boss.
Looks good.
Who's it gonna be?
I need a man to avenge Tamaki.
We'll handle any fallout.
We'll exclude anyone
with a wife and kids... right, Reiji?
I'll go.
Please let me do it.
No, this job's too big for you.
Anyone else?
Muraki just got out.
Well?
Who's it gonna be?
Hello?
Beauty parlor?
This ain't no beauty parlor!
I'll do it.
I'll go.
- But you just -
It's our only option.
I was planning on it anyway.
Where are you going?
I know what to do.
It's the Imai gang.
Get their boss.
There'll be no mistake.
Just give me two or three days.
There's someone I want to see first.
No, no sign of her.
I was gonna ask you.
The life's gone out of the game
without her around.
Muraki.
Nah, haven't seen
anyone like that. Right?
Nope. Have you?
Afraid not.
Wanna look inside?
That's Muraki of the Funada gang.
Quite a guy, huh?
Place your bets.
Ready?
Six and nine.
- How's your wife?
- It's not such a big deal.
She'll be home in a few days.
- I see.
Boss, I need a few more days.
- Sure.
There's no hurry.
Enjoy yourself while you can.
Listen, when you do it,
no guns. Use a knife.
That's no way to carry a baby!
Place your bets...
You alone?
Looks like a lot of newcomers.
Yeah, but the same class of client.
I haven't seen that Yoh
around anywhere.
Probably out shooting up.
- Muraki, long time no see.
- Sorry I've been out of touch.
- Is Funada well?
- Yes.
Sit down.
I'll front you some funds.
I can't today.
Perhaps next time.
TOMORROW AT 3:00
AT THE CHURCH - SAEKO
So it's you.
Stop following me around.
Marry that guy.
I'm headed back to prison.
Don't believe me
if you don't want to.
I don't.
Who's Saeko?
Fine. Go wherever you like.
Run off with your Saeko.
But you won't get rid of me.
I'll follow you wherever you go.
I can't live without you!
Is your stomach upset?
Your breath smells bad.
I really am headed back to jail.
I've already told you...
it's time you settled down.
Lead a decent life.
Well?
Got your affairs all settled?
I'm not trying to rush you.
There's no real hurry.
Is your wife back home?
The baby's his spitting image.
A strange little creature.
Congratulations.
I've settled my affairs.
Listen... there's no need
to rush things.
Did you have a good time?
Muraki, get those teeth fixed
before you go.
A few more visits should do it.
Reiji, let's go.
Jiro, try this on.
Wow! That's some cool suit.
How do I look?
- It's yours.
- No kidding?
Your finger's in the pocket.
That's a rotten trick!
I shot up the other day.
You idiot!
But it was no big deal.
Where?
A doctor friend got me some.
Why are you so concerned
about me anyway?
Just stay away from that stuff.
Got that?
Okay, I will.
I'll show you something
even better than dope.
I'm going to kill a man.
Kill a man?
Want to come?
It's so pointless.
Yeah, it is.
The Wild Goose.
That's where he's gonna be.
The Wild Goose?
I loved watching wild geese fly
when I was a kid.
Don't see many these days.
They're all gone.
There's a bitter taste
in my mouth...
but I feel almost giddy.
I'm about to do a job...
it feels I was meant to do.
Fate, you might say.
It's something I need to do.
It's no big deal.
It'll be over soon.
That's right.
It'll be over soon.
You know, I really like you.
He did it.
Muraki pulled it off.
Not as smoothly as last time,
but he did it.
TWO YEARS LATER
Place your bets...
Hey, how's it going?
Well enough.
How about you?
- Same as always.
Hey, come on in.
Muraki!
When did you get here?
About a week ago.
How many years has it been?
How are things on the outside?
That girl you brought
to our den, Saeko -
What was she to you?
Just a client. Why?
She's dead.
Dead?
- She was killed.
- Who did it?
Remember Yoh,
that guy our boss picked up?
Yoh?
It was kind of a scandal.
A crime of passion.
And from what happened,
we discovered who she really was.
She was actually -
- Muraki, time's up.
Saeko is dead.
It makes no difference
who she was.
Saeko...
Even now, knowing she's dead,
I hunger for her.
THE END
