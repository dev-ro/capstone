Someone is knocking the door.
Go away.
What's the matter?
She's 13 or 1 4 years old
and she's in labour.
Whatever it's she needs help.
She's not married.
l won't attend to her.
l can't help it.
l've no other choice.
Someone will take care of you.
You'll have a good life.
l'll cry for you everyday.
Hold the bag.
Quick! Quick!
A child!
-Who's that?
-Run! Run!
Stop there!
-Look there!
-What is that?
Something is floating.
Hey, boys!
What's going on there?
What are you all up to?
Go away.
lt came in the goods train.
We took it out from there.
Surya!
Surya!
Why did my mother discard me?
Usually people only dump rubbish.
But my mother dumped me.
You made a mistake by
stopping at one.
lf you'd given birth to one more
son, 10 more villages would have..
prospered.
lt was not your fault.
l wonder how and
where that boy is!
Surya, don't.
-He beat up that Ramana.
-A real beating.
Get lost.
Do you know who's Ramana?
l don't care who he is.
You know what he did?
Come here.
Tell them.
He'd borrowed money from Ramana.
He couldn't pay his due this month.
Say why you couldn't pay.
My child had chicken pox. l'd spent
all my money for his treatment.
What did Ramanan tell you?
Say it!
He said, ''lt's alright if you don't
pay. Take good care of your child.''
''That's very important.''
''But till you repay me the money,
let your wife stay with me.''
This is what he told me.
Then he held her by the hair and
dragged her right before my eyes.
Don't cry.
Everyone just stood by and watched.
Why? Because he's Devaraj's man.
Everyone is so scared
of that Devaraj.
What will that Devaraj do?
What will that Devaraj do?
This is not visiting hours.
Devaraj, why bother yourself?
Ramana.. Ramana...
Dr Sir.. -Will Ramana survive?
-Will he survive or not?
-l can't say.
-How did this happen?
-Deva, please be calm
Look at him first and
then talk to me.
How many of them got together
and did this?
One man
Who?
Banthalu!
Surya......
Go and bring him.
Devaraj wants to see you.
He told us to bring you
-Take off your hand.
-What'll you do if l don't?
What will you do?
Ask your Devaraj to come
here if he wants to see me.
My mother has been admitted to the
hospital. Dad has no money.
How much money do you have?
How about you?
That's all?
This is not enough.
Do you have any money?
-Don't lie.
-l really don't have any.
-Pass me that.
-That's my mother's
Come here!
This girl's mother is in hospital.
Her life is in danger. Give me.
You'll get your bangle back.
Give me.
Why are you crying?
This is just money.
Ramana is in hospital.
lf anything happens to him,
you won't be alive.
Devarajan!
What will you do? You'll
get your men to kill me?
Ask them to come. Before l die,
atleast ten of them will die
There must be justice.
Find out what your Ramana did.
What did he do?
-Banthalu!
-Er.....
Don't threaten the poor.
l don't know what Ramana did. But
he has been with me for ten years.
lf he doesn't return from the
hospital, you won't be alive.
l don't want this.
l can't take it back home.
l lied to my dad
that l'd lost it.
Why don't you give it to
that girl's mother?
-What's your name?
-Subbu.
Subbulaksmi.
lf you want to do a good deed,
do it yourself.
Understand?
lt seems Ramana has died.
The police have come for you.
-What's your name?
-Surya.
What's your father's name?
Can't you hear?
What's your father's name?
-Don't know.
What's your mother's name?
Don't know.
You don't know your father's
name or mother's name.
l don't know.
Has Arjun come back?
No. He has gone to settle a clash
between two villages.
Will my son be alright?
Sign on this.
Check your belongings.
You can go.
Ramathurai has given a statement
saying that it was he who killed..
-Why?
-Deva.
Why?
Why did you bring me out?
Devarajan is not a man of virtue.
But l know what's justice.
What Ramana did was wrong.
What you did was right.
You've suffered a lot
because of me. l'm sorry.
l'm an orphan. l'd have spent my
whole life in jail and died there.
You've sent your man
in to bring me out.
l don't know how to thank you.
What can l offer you?
-l don't want anything.
-l've only one thing.
That's my life.
-This is Surya.
-Vanakkam!
My friend.
My brother.
My Thalapathi. (Chief of Staff)
l've given the bangle.
What is this?
My family lives well
because of you.
lt's nothing!
No, it's because of you
May God bless you!
OK. Take your grandma back.
May God bless you!
One minute!
What's your name?
Thalapathi.
-Surya, is this necessary?
-OK. Leave it then.
lt's not that.
l mean, joining a man
like Devaraj......
-Do you have faith in me?
-l have.
l have faith in Devaraj.
lf your mother turns up one of
these days and ticks me off for...
bringing up her son like this,
what would l tell her?
What?
Are you trying to say that my
beloved mother will search...
all over the world, find you and
ask you about bringing up her son..
like this?
Oh, yes. She will ask.
lf you want, shall l call her now?
Hold on for a while.
Oh, my mother!
Where are you?
Come!
-What's the child's name?
-Meenatchi.
Come back after six months.
Otherwise we'll go to your place.
We really admire your love
and concern for children.
l believe that, if l look after
other's children, someone will...
look after mine.
Why worry about your son?
He's great.
-See you.
-OK.
lt's Ok.
A girl? l'm glad.
Does she resemble her dad or mum?
Surya!
How's the baby?
What name shall we give her?
Azhahi! Tamil Azhahi!
This is Surya. He'll give you
anything you ask him.
Are you Surya?
Do you know who l am?
Yes. You're Kalivardhan, Ex-MLA.
l've heard about you.
My boys told me.
l heard you're with Devaraj. Why?
-Devaraj is my friend.
-He's a hooligan. He's a loafer.
l put him in the
Taxi Drivers' Union.
l supported him for ten years
and he went against me.
He's ungrateful.
These things are alright.
l had an elder son.
He killed him brutally.
l know it. l also know that your
son tried to kill Devaraj.
Devaraj won't do anything
without a reason.
No, Surya. You don't
know about Deva.
You come to me.
l'll make you a bigger
man than Devaraj.
After me, you'll be the
strong man in this town.
Not only money. You'll have
power, status and a position.
-What do you say?
-Devaraj is my friend.
Devaraj is not keeping you with him
out of friendship or affection...
You are fearless. You'll
stand against any one.
lf you are with him
he will be safe.
That's why. lt's not
affection or friendship.
Come with me.
lf you stay with him you'll perish.
l'd rather die with him
than live with you.
Be blessed.
Deva...
What have l done to get
a friend like you?
lf someone had offered me such
-l may left.
But you.....
You're exaggerating it.
No, Surya. You have changed
Devaraj. You've made me a human.
People used to be scared of me.
They kept away from me.
But after you'd joined me, apart
from fear, they also respect me.
They show their respect
affectionately.
They wish me well whole-heartedly.
Come. You shouldn't
stay here anymore.
You should stay with
me in my house.
No, Deva.
l have a lot of ties here.
They fed me when l was hungry
and took care of me.
-How can l leave them?
-Won't you come when l call you?
There are so many people here.
You have so many.
But l have you only.
Deva!
Deva!
Look at my daughter!
When she was born,
you named her.
You treated her like your own
daughter and conducted her..
ear-piercing ceremony.
You sent her to school yourself
saying that girls should study.
When she attained puberty you
invited everyone and gave a feast.
Now my daughter is dead.
She hanged herself.
Come. Come and do the
last rites yourself.
-How did this happen?
-Sub-lnspector Palanivelu.
l saw you sitting in the bus. l
know that you don't like all this.
You're a Brahmin girl.
You sing the hymns.
You don't like violence.
But this Surya is like this.
That girl was two years
younger than you.
They kept her in the lock-up
the whole night.
One Sub-lnspector and
four constables.
They released her
only the next day.
When she went back home
she hanged herself.
Her father carried her in
his arms and came to us.
A fifteen year old girl!
What do you want us to do?
You won't like all this.
Surya is like that.
What happened?
Why are you crying?
l am asking you.
Why are you crying?
You don't like me? You don't
like a violent man like me?
-Then what's it?
-l like you.
-Then why are you crying?
-l don't know.
See you.
See you, sir.
You're transferred as a Collector.
We're very proud.
Devaraj, we haven't met for years.
How are you?
There is God. There are good men
around me. l'm alright.
How about you?
Times are not like before. l've to
wait patiently for everything.
l'm getting old.
l'm waiting for death.
Devaraj, you've not changed at all.
Do you remember? l hope you've
not forgotten the past.
l've not forgotten anything.
Be blessed!
-May you live a hundred years.
-With your blessings.
Deva!
Please take the prasad.
Deva, don't die!
Devaraj, open your eyes!
Breathe Devaraj, breathe!
Breathe, Devaraj! l'm around.
l'm with you.
Nothing is wrong with you.
You are alright.
Hold it.
You can't.....
Call the duty doctor.
Will Devaraj survive?
Difficult. He has 1 4 stab wounds.
lt's very difficult.
He must survive.
Devaraj will survive.
He won't die.
-Did the doctor say so?
-Devaraj told me.
He has decided.
He won't die.
Really?
Sir, Devaraj didn't die.
He has survived.
What shall we do now?
-l'm around Shanmugam.
-Sir, they.....
Don't fear.
l'll take care.
-What did you say his name was?
-Manoharan.
Look after Manoharan carefully
until all this is over.
Send him outstation for a while.
-Shanmugam?
-Forget about him.
They won't spare his life.
That's his fate.
l know.
Everyone should know what'll happen
if they lay their hands on Deva.
l'll show them.
-His name?
-Shanmugam.
-Have you informed his family?
-Yes.
-Has the investigation commenced?
-No, sir.
-Why?
-No witnesses.
How is that? lt happened
in broad light in public.
ls there not even one who saw it?
-They saw. But they won't say it.
-Why?
Fear.
-Afraid of whom?
-Devaraj, Surya.
This has happened here many times.
And it will happen again and again.
A thousand people would see it. But
not even one will give evidence.
He was alive a while ago.
Now he is no more.
They have burnt him alive.
Are we not going to
do anything about it?
We know who'd have done it. But
we've no evidence to convict them.
Not even one will come forward?
All l need is one witness.
That will do.
l saw the atrocity here. l can
identify the person who did it.
l can give evidence in court.
-Definitely?
-Yes.
Here's the witness you wanted.
Enough?
-Your name?
-Kumar.
-Age?
-36
Parents?
Father's name is Manickam and
mother's is Parvathy.
-Your name?
-Loganathan.
Age 42. Father is Sellathurai and
mother is Gandimathi.
-Name : Elango.
Age : 27.
-Parents?
-Karikalan and Thangam.
Name : Surya.
Age : 32.
What's your father's name?
Mother?
-What's your mother's name?
-l don't know.
Haven't l told you a hundred times?
l don't know, l don't know.
She dumped me. She dumped
me as soon as l was born.
Everyone was celebrating
Bogi festival.
People discarded old things.
My mother discarded me.
She dumped me in a goods train.
l don't know who she is.
Now you can identify them.
lsn't he the one who did it?
Tell me, sir.
Don't know.
Look at him and tell us.
No. l don't remember it well.
-Sir!
l can't say for sure.
No fear, no fear.
There's no such thing as fear.
Even if the whole world turns
against me l have no fear.
Even if they despise us and run
us down there's no fear.
You taught me this poem.
What happened now?
Are you afraid that Devaraj and
Surya will harm me and my mother?
ls my father afraid?
Some people have come to see
you with a petition.
How old were you then?
l was 13 or 1 4 years old then.
Was there a festival on that day?
Bogi.
Everyone was dumping old
and unwanted items.
l dumped my newborn child.
ln a goods train.
Why are you asking me this now?
Nothing... Nothing.
lt seems you never refuse if
someone asks you for something.
ls it true irrespective of
who asks you? -Why?
-lf l ask you?
-What do you want?
-What do you want?
-Get up and come with me.
l've made a vow that l'll
bring you to the temple.
Come. lt's for our marriage.
Who's that Devaraj?
-What happened?
-Surya.
Why is this town so bad?
Why so much crime?
-Two fellows.
-Do something, Arjun.
Do something.
Surya, who's that Subbulaksmi?
-Who's that?
-Yes, who's that?
No, l heard something.
That's why l asked.
What did you hear?
Oh, you mean that Subbulaksmi?
She's Pandi's grandmother.
-She's pretty.
-She sings well.
She loves Surya.
-You like her?
-You just eat.
-You like her or not?
-Can't you see from his face?
Her father works in the Collector's
Office. She's a Brahmin.
Why bother about that?
l'll take care of it.
Mr Srinivasan, this is Devaraj.
-l know. What's it?
-We've come to discuss a marriage.
We don't know about your custom.
We've brought a ring
according to ours.
We'll make all the arrangements and
take care of the wedding expenses.
You just fix an auspicious
date for the wedding.
-Who's the groom?
-Surya.
He's like a brother to me.
Who's the bride?
You must be kidding. We've come
to your house with a proposal...
for your daughter.
Do you like Surya?
-Say it.
-Yes.
Do you wish to marry him?
-When shall we hold the wedding?
-After my death.
What does Surya lack?
Who is Surya?
Who are his parents?
What is his caste?
Surya is not of your caste. He
doesn't wear a sacred thread.
-What else do you want.
-Must be worthy.
What worthiness are you talking
about? Are you worthy?
Will you help those in need?
He will. He gives whatever he has.
Your daughter will never
get a man like him.
l don't want such
a man in my family.
Don't you still understand?
She loves him. Why not let her
marry him and be happy?
l'd rather kill my daughter than
marry her to a rogue like him.
Let him go.
Please let him go.
He is my father, mother, Guru and
God. He's everything to me.
l beg you.
Please leave.
lt seems you'd gone there to
discuss about marriage.
-Yes.
-Who asked him to go there?
l suggested it to him.
Why? Did l ask you to
arrange my marriage.
Why should we go and be
told off by people?
l heard she told you all to leave.
ls she a celestial beauty?
Are there no other girls?
Who's she to ask you to leave?
l was just saying why should we go
there and get insulted.
Who are there? After all they
are people who fear us.
Why should we go to them?
Have l made a mistake?
l shouldn't have gone
there in such a haste.
No, Deva. She's nothing.
May be if l'd not gone there,
things would have worked out well.
So what? Forget about her.
No, Deva. She's not important to
me. lt's you who is important.
Deva is more important.
Father has fixed my marriage. l
couldn't say anything against him.
Next Wednesday.
Won't you say anything?
Won't you even ask
who l'm marrying?
-Who?
-The Collector.
Go. Go and marry him.
Who's stopping it?
Go ahead. Marry him.
What do you want? Fair complexion
and ability to speak English.
Go marry him.
Was it l who went after you?
Was it l who said l love you?
Was it l who cried on your
shoulders? Get lost.
Don't talk.
You've talked enough.
Don't cry. Go marry
him and be happy.
Go away.
A total of 64 cases
against the two of you.
You've your own court, own police
and own government here.
lf you call for someone, whoever it
is, he must appear before you
Otherwise he gets beaten up.
You pass judgement.
Whatever the court may say,
your word is law here.
You act as the judge for every
dispute that is brought before you.
Your house is the court.
People come to us for help
and we help them.
We've the courts, the police and a
government. Let them help.
They come to us because
you couldn't.
ls it because of that
or out of fear?
You don't like them coming to us?
We're talking about what's right
and what's wrong, not my likes..
Have you ever been poor?
Have you ever gone hungry?
Have you wondered around without
a cent in your pocket?
When your stomach is empty one
can't afford the legal expenses.
You can't spend your
time in the courts.
ls beating people in
public justice?
Then is police brutality justice?
There are laws to determine what's
justice and we are around to...
enforce it.
lt's wrong of you to take over the
job of the courts and government..
with 100 henchmen under you.
This is absurd.
lf someone comes to you with a
petition, you read it and...
give instructions as to
what's to be done.
But when we do it, it's wrong.
Only the Collector has the
authority to do it. Others can't.
You people have powers as an
lAS officer and a SP.
But we've the trust
of the people.
They believe that we can do
for them what you can't do.
Have you finished?
Finished shouting?
The people here may be afraid
when you shout. l'm not.
You don't like us.
You're educated and you're
from a well to do family.
You won't like ordinary people like
us even if we do good.
Yes, l don't like. Especially l
don't like gangsters like you.
This is Surya, sir.
Don't clash with me.
-l'll bash you.
-Try and touch me.
What do you want now?
What should we do?
You must stop everything
you're doing.
We can't.
Hello! Who are you?
Whom do you want to see?
-Come here.
-Go.
Hello, Pathma!
How are you?
Tamilazhgi!
You send us money every month.
l don't want it anymore.
Why?
l don't want it.
We're leaving this town.
What's the problem?
She's schooling here. We're also
around. Why should you go?
Now she has no father. l don't want
her to lose her mother also.
What happened?
When a woman lives alone
everyone here gets ideas.
Who misbehaved with you?
They say my husband has gone after
others' wives. So what's wrong?
My husband may have been a bad man.
He may have done a lot of wrong.
-But he took care of me
-Who? Who was it?
A lot of people including your men.
They bring the money you'd sent.
They hold my hand and give it.
They return after four days.
They chat and smile.
Then they put their hands on me.
What wrong have l done?
Who's it? Who's it?
Who put his hands on you. Tell me
l'll sever his hand.
No. l don't want anybody's hand.
There are lot of men in this town.
We are Leaving
Pathma!
Hold on for a while.
-Are you my friend?
-What's this Deva?
-Answer me. Are you my friend?
-As long as l'm alive.
-Will you do anything for me?
-Yes.
Come.
Selvi, come here.
You must marry Pathma and
support her till the end.
Today is an auspicious day
Everything will be alright.
l'm telling you.
You're one of my family.
l can't let you suffer.
He'll take care of you
till the end.
He'll take care of
your child as well.
He's my brother.
Put the pottu.
You don't like me.
l know that.
Your daughter lost her
father because of me.
l killed him.
l beat him to death.
l killed him with this hand.
He did wrong and l hit him.
And he died.
l didn't realize that
he'd have a family...
or he'd have a child like an angel.
This sinner didn't know.
When she was born, Deva
gave her to me to carry.
Do you know how l felt?
Do you know how l felt
when she smiles at me?
Do you know how l felt when l put
the pottu on your forehead today?
l am a sinner.
l have sinned. There's no
forgiveness for me.
Don't worry.
l'm just a protector of this house.
l'll protect you and your daughter.
That's all.
-What's it, Deva?
-Come.
Look at me.
Do you find anything?
Look carefully.
Selvi, come here.
-Tell me now.
-Child?
-Girl or boy?
-Boy.
Tomorrow is Bogi.
lt's already 32 years.
l can't.....
-Kalyani, how am l to.....
-l can't forget it.
Do you know that l'd a father?
He died before l was born.
Where's your father?
Don't know.
Mother?
Don't know.
-How?
-Azhahi!
How?
When l was born, my mother
carried me and looked at me.
l was dark. So my mother
didn't like me.
See that yellow cloth there.
She rolled me in that cloth and
dumped me in a goods train.
From there l landed
in a rubbish dump.
Then from there l came here
floating in that canal there.
-That canal?
-Yes.
One blessed woman took me from
there and brought me up.
And l grew up.
Now l'm talking to
this blessed girl.
Beat them and drag them away.
Get hold of all of them.
Why do this at the temple?
Selvi!
Selvi!
ls the Collector in?
Mr Collector!
Mr Collector!
Come out.
He's not in town.
He'll return tomorrow.
ls the Collector your son?
Only son?
Ask him to be careful before
we do something to him.
l need something from you.
They say you'd give if one asks
you. Can l ask?
-What do you want?
-You won't refuse?
-What do you want?
-You should leave Devaraj.
You're a good man. You'll do
anything to help others.
But you stand on the side of
Devaraj and commit crimes.
What atrocity is this?
Who are you to question me? Did the
Collector send you to intercede?
He wants to separate me from Deva?
Tell him he can't.
-Why are you with Deva?
-He's my friend.
lf l die tomorrow, l only have
Deva to do my last rites.
He may be a good man or bad man.
But he's my friend.
l won't leave him
for anyone's sake.
-Even if God comes l won't.
-lf your mother comes.
-lf your mother comes?
-What are you saying?
-My mother?
-Yes.
-l don't have a mother.
-You have.
-How do you know?
-l know.
l know it for some time.
No. l won't believe it.
Yes. ln fact she's in
this town itself.
ln this town? Who?
Who is she?
Arjun's mother is your mother also
The Collector is..... my.....
-How do you know?
-l know for sure.
How?
After you were born, she rolled you
in a yellow cloth and left you in..
a train.
And she cries for you even today.
She....
l saw she is in temple
Will she talk to me?
No.
You have a family.
You've a mother.
You have a brother.
l'm in your father's position.
No... No..No..
She's not my mother.
She dumped me.
l was a disgrace to her.
So she dumped me.
Did l ask her to
give birth to me?
She's not my mother.
The one who picked me up from the
canal is my mother.
Those who fed me when l was hungry,
are all my mothers.
She's not my mother.
She's the Collector's mother.
l have nothing to do with her.
-l don't even wish to see her.
-What happened was not her fault.
lt's someone's sin.
She was only about 1 4 then.
She didn't know what to do.
She could neither keep
you nor abort you.
She left you in the train hoping
someone will look after you.
But since then, there was not a
single day when she didn't cry.
She's longing for you.
-Does she know?
-No.
She need not know.
She shouldn't know that
she has a son like this.
My hands are bloodstained.
She need not know.
Promise me.
What happened?
Why are you crying?
l too feel like crying.
Mother, tell him not to cry.
My mother is around.
She's in this town itself.
The Collector's mother
is my mother also.
-But l can't call her mother.
-Why?
She's in a high position.
What if she tells me off?
She won't.
We've to do something.
We get beaten when we mention
the name Deva or Surya.
We've to stop it at once.
Otherwise they'll destroy us.
Why don't we stop?
Why not put an end to everything?
lt's enough.
You've everything.
You've a name.
You've fame. You've influence.
ls it not enough?
No. lt's not enough for me.
lf a man says what he has is
enough, it's shameful.
Why should we stop? Should we stop
because some Collector asks us to?
They'll beat up and lock-up anyone
they wish. Should we keep quiet?
There should have been
a child here.
No, l won't stop just because they
want us to. Let them stop.
Either that Arjun must die.
Or Devaraj and Surya must die.
Till then this war won't end.
-ls the Collector in?
-Yes.
l want to see him.
l want to see him.
-How are you?
-l'm fine.
Does he take good care of you?
He's a very good man.
l don't know how. But in
character he is like you.
l want to talk to you alone.
You don't like me.
l know it well.
Still, l've come with a request.
Get a transfer out of this place.
You're a good man. You do
good to a lot of people.
l'm telling you this as l don't
want anything to happen to you.
Please leave this town.
You'll beat up people in public.
Burn them alive.
You'll batter an lnspector. You
won't fear the court or the law.
But l must fear you and leave
this place. ls it?
l'll go. But before that
l'll destroy all of you.
You're a good man.
You're a very good man.
We're bad people.
l wish you well.
You've a father.
You've a mother.
-You have a family.
-Threatening me?
No. l am begging you.
l am older than you.
l'm like your elder brother.
lf l'd a brother like you, my mum
would have dumped you long ago.
l wish you well.
This is Surya's.
What's your name?
Come.
Shall we remove this?
Good girl.
Do you like chocolates?
How much do you like?
A lot?
They'll give you chocolates.
You shouldn't cry.
This is nothing.
You shouldn't cry now.
-You forgot this.
-This is Surya's.
When Surya was born,
his mother looked at him.
He was very dark.
His mother didn't like him.
She rolled him in a yellow
cloth and dumped him.
Give me.
Kalyani!
What's the matter?
What happened?
Tell me what happened.
My son......
He's alive.
Surya!
l know..
He's good man.
You don't know that.
Your son is a very good man.
l know it very well.
Believe me.
Tell him.
l'm Manoharan. l've been with
Devaraj for ten years.
l've been with him
in all his activities.
Now l wish to become an approver.
Arrest Warent!
They have arrested Devaraj.
They're dragging him on
the road with handcuffs.
Down with the Collector!
Down with the Collector!
Down with the SP.
Down with the SP.
Release Devaraj!
Release Devaraj!
l heard they've arrested Devaraj.
ls this Surya's mother?
Why's she crying?
Let's go in.
Mum, why did you dump me?
Mum, why did you put me
in the goods train?
What wrong did l do?
Why did you do this?
Do you know how angry
l was with you?
l was very angry with the
mother l'd never seen.
l wanted to ask you a thousand
questions when l meet you.
But now when l see you, all
my anger has disappeared.
l want to keep calling you mum.
Look at me once.
You suffered all these
years was because of me.
l dumped you even before you
could open your eyes.
l didn't name you.
l never carried you.
l've never fed you even once.
Why did you get such a mother?
You should have been born
to a virtuous woman.
But l know that one day
l'll find my son back.
l know that l'll
see him again.
l wanted to fall at
his feet and cry.
Don't cry, mum.
Come with me Surya.
Let's all go somewhere else.
Renounce all this.
Let's all stay together.
When l'd no one else,
only Deva was with me.
How can l leave him now?
You must stay with Arjun and l must
stay with Deva. That's justise.
l hear them talk about
shooting orders.
l've found you after
so many years.
lf anything happens to you
or Arjun l can't bear it.
l should have died as
soon as l was born.
l don't fear death now.
Don't worry about Arjun.
l won't harm Arjun.
l swear on you.
l swear on my mother.
he chief secretary wants to
speak with you urgently.
Sir, l can explain.
Sir, please give some time.
Fellows like Devaraj......
They've transferred me to Madras.
The transfer orders will
come next Monday.
We've time only till then.
Devaraj released.
The Collector must die.
The SP must die.
That's your responsibility.
Let's not do things rashly.
So far we've only hit and punished
those who have done wrong.
Look at this!
Every Tom, Dick and Harry at the
police station hit me and...
kicked me.
We'll hit them back.
We'll get them transferred.
Why do say we shouldn't do
anything to the Collector?
ls it because your ex sweetheart
is married to him?
You don't want her
to become a widow?
What did you say?
Look at me and say that.
Don't deny. The Collector's father
comes looking for you.
Things are happening without
my knowledge.
You suspect me?
Do you know what's friendship?
Do you know what's a friend?
Do you know who's Surya?
l've told you once before that l'll
even give my life for you.
Take it! Take it!
My life is for you.
Why don't you understand that?
No one is important to me.
Even my mother is not.
lt's you who's important to me.
Understand?
Then kill him.
-l can't do that.
-Why?
-l can't.
-Why not?
-l can't Deva.
-Why?
Because Arjun is my brother.
My mother is Arjun's mother too.
l've sworn to my mother that
l'll not harm Arjun.
Deva and Surya won't be around when
you leave this place.
What do you mean?
Certain just action can't be
carried out through legal means.
-Kalivardhan?
-Yes.
We're not going to do anything.
They'll clash between themselves
and kill each other.
We just close our eyes.
They'll be no difference
between them and us.
There will be.
We'll be alive tomorrow. But
Devaraj or Surya won't be alive.
What's this Arjun?
Please stop it.
l beg you.
l'll fall at your feet.
Don't do it.
Surya is my son.
l gave birth to him.
Don't harm him.
Please spare him.
Despite knowing all this,
you remained with me?
Knowing they are your
family you left them?
Knowing they're your
own flesh and blood......
Why?
Because you're my friend.
Look at him!
Look at my Surya!
He has even left his
family to be with me.
Did you see my lieutenant?
ls Surya your son?
My elder brother?
l clashed with my own brother.
l tried to get rid of your son.
l don't have any siblings.
You're the only one for me.
lf Arjun is your brother,
he's also my brother.
lf you've a family,
it's mine also.
Don't try to separate me.
l won't allow it.
l won't let anything
happen to your son.
l won't let anything
happen to my brother.
Deva, where to?
We're going to see the Collector.
We're going to surrender to him.
Yes, sir.
One minute.
-Dad, SP wants to talk to you.
-What's it about?
He tells us not to do anything
to Deva and Surya.
Tell him l'm not in.
Mr Collector! Mr Collector!
l've come to surrender.
My Surya's family is mine also.
l've come to surrender.
l'm alright, Deva.
l'm alright, Deva.
Surya, don't go.
Wait, Surya.
Kalivardhan!
Kalivardhan!
Kalivardhan!
You killed my friend.
You killed my Deva.
You killed my comrade.
You killed him right
before my eyes.
We don't have any evidence or
witness against Surya.
We can't do anything.
Brother!
Mum, let's go.
Mum, come. lt's time.
You carry on.
We'll stay with Surya.
