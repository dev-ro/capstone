I left the village when I was thirteen.
I became a leading actor at sixteen.
I was once very successful.
But if you ask me again,
I did it all just to get by.
I never imagined I would end up
in this shit hole...
at this point in my life.
Many people say the film world is ridiculous.
However, life is even more ridiculous.
I once said, if I lose my memory one day.
Someone will have to teach me
how to smile again.
To smile is tiring.
I'm very tired.
And I don't want to go on.
Hey, let me help you.
I was having lunch,
and completely lost track of time.
You're the one they call Uncle Yin?
Well, most of the time
they just call me Gramps.
But those who have been here for a while
call me "Uncle Yin".
It's just a name, whatever.
Uncle Yin, are you the only
security guard here?
There's no one but me.
I know everyone and everything here...
family background,
even when they take out the trash, and so on.
It's a safe neighborhood, don't you worry.
Come on in.
It's not too bad in here.
No one's lived here for a while;
just needs to be tidied up
and it will be as good as new.
Uncle Yin.
What is this? That's really not necessary.
Please take it.
It will be.
I only opened the door for you;
was just doing my job.
You're too kind.
Most people leave this place and move up;
never the other way round.
But I've never seen someone
famous moving in here.
Well, since you are moving into a new place...
it is important to perform the rituals,
you know, just to say hi.
Put your stuff down...
Here, take this. It's just a polite gesture.
Shall we?
Calm down now...
Nothing crazy, alright?
Don't do anything crazy now.
With respect...
I'll leave you alone now.
What time is it, Mr. Fox?
It's twelve now Daddy.
Mommy wants me to go to sleep.
When are you coming back?
Today she made me wash off the watch you drew.
I haven't seen you for days...
When are you coming back
to draw me another one?
Don't forget your blanket.
Lights out...
who are you talking to?
Hear my prayer... do no evil...
get out you devils...
Everything's alright now.
Let him be. He needs to be alone.
Let's go.
Get some rest then.
Off you go, everyone...
Everything's alright now.
You should all go home
and get ready for dinner.
What time is it, Mr. Fox?
It's twelve now Daddy.
Mommy wants me to go to sleep.
When are you coming back?
Today she made me wash off the watch you drew.
I haven't seen you for days...
When are you coming back
to draw me another one?
Don't forget your blanket.
Lights out...
Pardon me, pardon me... Good luck to you...
You don't have to thank me...
I'm sorry for eating your chicken...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
I beg your pardon, sorry to be a bother...
Good luck to you... you'd better watch out
for yourself...
He's been here for an hour nursing one beer.
Probably waiting for you.
Why are you so late?
It's going to be as busy as hell in a minute.
So? We never have that many customers anyways.
I know exactly who sits where
and who orders what.
Ping always has the steamed meat
with preserved vegetables,
and a double order of the house special
glutinous rice.
Old Chung and Jill have the stir fried fish
with noodles,
vegetables, and some of our rice
with extra oil...
Wing Ping's gonna have the steamed fish
with scallions with less oil,
and some pork with a double order
of glutinous rice.
Yung, Keung and Kit
always have the Soup of the Day
along with our rice,
and salty fish with vegetables to eat here.
Auntie Lai, a bowl of white rice
with the Soup of the Day but to go.
Auntie Lai passed away last month.
So? She still needs to eat, doesn't she?
We prepare exactly 28 bowls
of glutinous rice every day.
Who is this order for?
I'll do these two myself. On the house.
If it wasn't for Brother Yau's generosity,
you'd be charged double for that!
House special kale, fried ribs.
Two bowls of congee! Split two ways.
Auntie Mui.
Wait a minute. I'll be right there.
Auntie Lai, you should be on your way now
after you've had a good meal.
You should eat while it's hot.
Why do you have your food split two ways?
I have diabetes,
and I can't eat salt - doctor's orders.
Yau is very kind...
He makes two portions for me...
One half is regular, the other is low sodium...
So it's good for both my husband and I.
Fuck off
ls the steamed rice ready?
He's not as kind as Auntie Mui though,
she's an angel.
She helps out by fixing everyone's clothes...
Takes care of the kids in the building.
Cooks, and helps with groceries too.
Listen to all those sweet words.
What is it you need this time?
Can you alter the waist a bit?
Yes, of course.
But please don't let Uncle Tung know...
Last time he found out, he was telling me
off the whole way home.
Got to get back to work;
I don't want to piss my boss off.
Are you good with sewing?
Not really...
I've just got nothing else to do... so...
I look for something to do.
Just trying to help where I can.
Do you have clothes that need repairing?
Well...
I have some old film costumes of mine,
from my movies...
I've kept them for years...
It's a pity how damaged they have become
over the years.
I can help you...
so you can keep them in better condition.
So... how long are you planning to stay here?
Why do you ask?
Nothing really...
I'm sorry for being nosy...
Have you noticed anything...
about apartment 2442?
It's been vacant for so long...
You know what I mean, don't you?
I don't believe in those things.
It's probably for the best you don't.
Is this meant to be worn by humans?
Why does a pig need to wear clothes?
Stop moving or I'll prick you!
Have you seen those pig feet of hers?
She's so fucking fat.
Just you wait and see,
Yau's place is going to close down...
because that fat pig eats everything!
Gosh... that mouth of yours!
You know what I think... it's a conspiracy...
Yau and that fat pig, they want us
to end up fatter than her!
Her squinty little pig eyes.
Old man, they don't charge us for it, you know.
That's the point! Free food large portions...
how is that not a conspiracy?
I'm telling you...
Someday I'm going to kill them
with a fucking nuclear bomb.
Ouch! That hurts!
Fucking parents, letting their kids out
at this time of night...
Your glutinous rice is amazing.
So? Where does that get me?
You make the best in town.
What more do you want?
My great-great grandfather started
carrying glutinous rice,
with him way back in the old days.
You probably know that it's not just
used for cooking, right?
What else? For hunting Vampires?
Oh? So you know that Vampires
are afraid of glutinous rice? Eh?
In the old days, all successful Vampire Hunters,
had special relationships
with the best rice shops...
That way, they got discounts
for the glutinous rice they needed.
Rice was really worth something back then...
Vampire hunters carried glutinous rice
with them at all times...
This relationship was passed down
from generation to generation.
And subsequently to me...
But since all the Vampires
have miraculously vanished...
Along with all the Vampire hunters.
So what do Vampire hunters do
when there are no fucking Vampires left?
They cook.
Thank you for saving my life this morning.
You mean getting in your way?
But just because I stopped you once...
Doesn't mean I can stop you the next time.
Save it and thank me
if you're still around next time.
Old man, where have you been?
It's late...
I was looking for you.
I was here.
I was afraid of losing you...
Why are your feet still so cold?
The soaking isn't helping...
Are you feeling unwell?
I'm alright...
I'll be back in a few days...
Wait for me.
Master, I'll leave it to you then.
Don't worry. I will take care of it.
This is a token of thanks, please accept it.
I'll be on my way now.
Gau.
Let's talk privately.
Auntie Mui, that's a lot of groceries.
Yes... Tung... Tung is coming home...
He loves fish...
How is he?
He's good... he's coming home...
So, I should get back to work now.
Auntie Mui.
Pak,
You can't come here any more...
run along now... be a good boy.
To preserve the body
we must choose a dark place...
within the place where he was last living.
In order to be discreet.
We bury his body in soil in the bathtub.
Later, we move the body to a coffin
where it must remain in total darkness.
While keeping the coffin off the ground...
We'll use crows blood in place of chicken blood,
which will work together
with the amulet on his chest...
to collect the essence of the "yin" spirit.
Clouds of the spirits... open...
against the gods' will...
Remember, never take the mask off.
How much longer until Tung comes back?
Seven days.
Tung's spirit will come back...
it may be the perfect time then.
May be?
What if it doesn't work?
If it doesn't work, I still have another way.
What is it?
It's very extreme and should not be used
unless absolutely necessary.
We'll talk later.
Clouds of the spirits... open...
blessed by the ashes...
spirits... grant me the power...
against the gods will...
Mommy!
Roast pork is nice.
They've gone now... They wont come back..
Just walk against the wall
at this hour every night...
Good luck to you... good luck to you...
good luck to you...
Honey. The dying plant you
brought home last week...
it blossomed last night.
Please don't misunderstand...
I'm seventy-two...
If it weren't for looking
after the two of them...
I would have already retired a long time ago.
I just didn't want them to be sent away!
They've been asked to leave many times...
So I found them a place to stay here.
Why does that woman hang
around my apartment all the time...
She lived in 2442 for years.
She was reserved, and didn't speak much...
But she had a warm smile...
Her husband seemed like a nice man...
He was a tutor to two twin girls
in the neighborhood...
Feng goes back to 2442 everyday...
She gets scared, leaves
and returns the next day...
She doesn't dare go inside...
yet she can't stop herself from going back.
Her kid is a good boy.
His mother gathers the food
that the other leave outside their doors
for ancestor worship...
He just gobbles it all up without a word.
Is the bike yours?
How about I fix that for you?
Dear, do you not like the food tonight?
Haven't touched your plate at all.
It's been getting windy recently.
It's harder for me to go up
and down the stairs...
maybe I got fat.
Maybe I did...
Maybe it's a conspiracy...
Yau... and that fat pig...
It's a big conspiracy...
Yes it is, yes it is...
Gosh, that mouth of yours!
Dear. We are not young any more...
We'll be a hundred years old sooner or later...
If you get cold... you have to wear something...
take care of yourself...
If you're not happy you have to speak up...
don't keep it inside, okay?
The flowers are all dried out now...
but you told me not to climb up
and down for them...
I can't do it all on my own...
There's only the two of us left, you know?
Did I prick you? You have to tell me if I did...
Please don't leave me alone.
You said you would come back...
Why aren't you eating? You don't like the food?
You shouldn't smoke too much?
I just need to get one more pair
of chopsticks. Take a seat.
You expecting a company?
Nah, just my flatmates.
You can see them?
Sometimes.
And yet you still stay here?
Do you think that there are
any apartments without ghosts?
They are attached to the land itself;
not to the house.
I have stayed here for a few decades,
but they have been here for more than a century.
I'll probably be staying here when I die too...
It makes good sense to develop
a good relationship beforehand.
I need your help.
It's about 2442.
Do you think any museum will want this stuff?
Or should I just sell them to one of those
places that collects scrap metal?
These are things from your father?
Yes, from many generations ago.
The brown stains, that's blood.
It's so deep that it can't be washed away,
no matter how hard I try.
Back in the days, there were a lot
of eerie things in my village.
We took care of them with these tools.
Where is your family now?
In this business, no one comes to a happy end.
Five hours, Five Hours...
I will return before midnight.
Five Hours.
Four hours?
I just remember my father would leave me
at our neighbors place
whenever he went out to work.
Being a Taoist monk, he really didn't earn much;
the money he earned wasn't even enough
for paying the babysitting fees.
Thanks...
For many generations,
my family called wherever we went home.
But there was never a fucking home.
This was the last place my father brought me.
He planned for us to stay for a few days.
But we ended up living here for a few decades.
How come?
I'll come back for you before midnight.
He went out one night, and never came back.
After all, it is all fate.
Pak drew this.
So what?
I did all I could the last time already.
If you are scared, that is your problem;
it's not their fault.
Feng is mentally ill. She should go to a doctor.
After all, I'm just a cook.
You can help, why don't you?
Why the hell is it your business now?
And how do you know I can help?
You don't even know me...
And do you even fucking know them?
Cut that shit, are you helping or not?
Are you even capable of helping others?
Look at yourself, you're a fucking mess!
What's that supposed to mean?
That's obviously drawn by a kid,
The ink's already faded
yet you're still keeping it.
Couldn't let it go, could you?
If you really didn't care,
you wouldn't bother keeping
all these things, would you?
In humans there are both the good and the bad...
and so it is with spells as well.
But the darker the color of the amulet paper,
the greater the power of the spell.
To ask for power from the gods
this way... is evil;
It is an extreme measure
that poses danger to both oneself
as well as others.
Trust me, this is not that simple.
Thank you...
You son of a bitch!
You used his life as bait for the twins.
I've asked for your help before...
but you refused.
I didn't have a choice,
might as well just have done it on my own.
You know how powerful those twins are.
But you have forced me to get involved.
Well, at least it's all over now.
You don't look that great, really pale...
like you are running out of time or something.
The cabinet can't possibly hold them
for much longer.
Burn it.
Let me take care of it...
once I perform the ceremony..
I'll burn it.
We have to stay like this forever.
Yes, forever.
When can we go home?
As long as we are together...
anywhere is our home.
Look, it's still here...
Thank you...
Pak, stop playing now, have some food.
It won't snow in Hong Kong, will it?
I haven't seen it, no.
So... Will it?
It may.
Mommy said, white is the most beautiful
color in the world...
is it?
Yes.
Glutinous rice with vegetables!
What's wrong with you people?
In your dying days or something?
You all smell of menthol and eucalyptus oil.
We didn't use any.
Iced lemon tea!
Iced lemon tea.
One iced lemon tea, coming right up!
Eat it while it's hot... okay...
Hey, did you all get your clothes
repaired by Mui?
Yeah.
And has anyone seen Uncle Tung lately?
Nope. How about you ask Uncle Yin?
Feng told me that some guy killed Tung.
She also said that the guy
had a lot of kids with him.
Kids? Here?
Feng is nuts, you really believe what she says?
Railing in the stairwell is all bent
and screwed up.
Look at this... I found...
this tooth beside it.
What? ls there a name on it?
It looks like Tung's gold tooth.
Every night at eleven,
he opens his eyes...
his feet bang the top of the coffin...
As if he wants to jump...
Did you take off the mask?
This is normal,
just don't take off the mask,
everything will be fine.
How much longer do I need to wait...
Besides growth in his hair and his nails,
it doesn't seem like anything is happening.
I've been feeding him crows blood every day...
Should I get some blood from a black dog too?
The blood of black dogs is useless.
Trust me, just go home.
Gau... you said that there was another way...
What is it? Please tell me.
What I need is the blood of a virgin.
Do you know how to get it?
Just don't draw any attention to yourself,
Tung will come back for sure.
Just remember... never ever take the mask off.
Uncle Yin, what do you want?
Sorry to bother you, Gau.
I received some complaints...
Someone said there are kids here
making noise late at night.
I told them... it's not possible,
you don't have kids.
...still, it's my responsibility to come by
and check it out.
Well, thanks.
Auntie Mui!
What a surprise to see you here.
I went to your place... but it's been locked
for the last few days...
I thought you went back to your home town.
So... how is Tung?
He's fine... thank you...
Really?
Hey Gau.
I've known you since you were a kid,
and you're still messing around
with that black magic shit.
Where is Tung?
Pak, are you going to Auntie Mui's apartment?
Hi there Auntie Mui...
haven't seen you around lately...
is everything alright?
Oh... everything's fine...
Tung is feeling unwell...
I need to take care of him.
He's just getting old. It's nothing.
Well, take care then.
Pak!
Don't bother Uncle Tung!
It's alright. He's just a child.
Well, I'll be off then...
Auntie Mui... I need to take a pee.
You really want to go to the bathroom?
Alright then.
I created it.
It started out as an accident.
You always warned me that my evil ways
would do me in.
and indeed my final years have been
very unpleasant.
Terminal stage of lung cancer,
The cigarettes I smoke...
are made from ashes of the unborn...
Their yin for my yang... one of those
significant choices that one makes in life.
The smell coming out
of Auntie Mui's apartment...
was from the preservatives...
You were in the process of turning
Tung's corpse into a vampire.
... and the twin ghosts...
were needed to bring him back to life.
Every night at eleven you must scatter
a packet of this onto his body...
to get rid of the smell of rotting flesh.
I will come over tonight.
The twin ghosts are different
from the unborn children...
Two live as one... they are more potent...
I needed a body... big enough...as a vessel
to hold them
If we didn't use the mask and the oil,
Tung's corpse would have been out of control.
I never thought it would turn out
like this...
I have run out... of time...
Pak!
Pak!
Pak!
Pak... where are you?
Tung was the body without the spirit,
The twins were the spirits without the body...
I'll prepare a trap in the hallway.
I'll try to attract the vampire
with the corpse oil.
You go on and find Feng.
Be quick!
Pak...
Pak...
the twins have possessed the vampire...
it happened too fast, they were gone
in the blink of an eye.
Is there any way, you can help me to fight on?
No! If I do that you'll fucking die.
I should have died the first day I came here...
I still owe you a thank you from that...
We're even now.
Let's give it a go.
Let's hope the corpse oil
will attract the vampire.
Once you're inside the trap,
one cigarette's time is all you have.
Once it burns up,
you'll never be able to come back.
It's all on you now.
WATER
WOOD
We're running out of time!
Hurry the fuck up!
EARTH
METAL
FIRE
My dear Tung,
let's leave together...
shall we?
Trimming your toenails again?
Get to work, you bum!
Would you like pork chops, sweety?
Help, Somebody! Help!
Dr. Choy, someone's here to ID the body.
You are...?
I am his son.
