THE LITTLE BATHER
Winner: France,
the Little Bather.
1 hour, 23 min, 30 sec.
I don't speak Italian.
I speak French. Here's my
card: Marcello Cacciaperotti.
Can I get the rights
to sell in Italy?
To the Little Bather.
Do I get the exclusive rights?
Talk to my boss.
He built it.
Fourchaume is a
friend of mine.
He's from the Little Bather.
He has to call his boss.
Yes, can I get Mr.
Fourchaume's address?
Thanks a lot.
Aspetare... that's all
she can say.
Never mind. Or we'll
miss our flight.
It's not my fault.
Hurry up, per favore.
She doesn't care.
Mi fratello... he won the race.
They're not in a hurry,
can't you see?
We can't wait two hours.
Our plane's leaving.
I'm not deaf.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The Oscar for the best boat
goes to the Little Bather.
Built by the Fourchaume shipyard.
I'm from the Fourchaume shipyard.
50 Little Bathers before
the end of the month.
Thank you.
Today, at the Fourchaume shipyard,
the Indestructible will be launched.
After the ceremony, there will
be a big party with the mayor.
Big day today, hey?
We won with the
Little Bather.
Mr. Fourchaume.
As minister, I take
great pleasure...
...in meeting Mr. Fourchaume,
the creator of the Indestructible...
...the sailing symbol
of France.
Can I introduce to you:
Mr. Castagnier.
The designer and creator
of this beautiful boat.
My compliments.
-Look...
Excellency... can
we start?
Go ahead.
-Father...
In nomine patris et filii...
...et spiritus sancti. Amen.
Ready!
Go ahead, madam.
-Please hold this.
Forgive her. She doesn't
know her own strength.
I'm all muscle.
Are we leaving?
No?
Why didn't we leave?
Castagnier!
Goodbye.
And I'm taking those
weights away from you.
Bring me the Castagnier file.
Castagnier!
Well?
-What?
I think it's the petrol.
I don't understand.
I think it's the
chlorohydrates.
I don't understand a word.
Shall I show you
on the blackboard?
Let's go.
-Ok.
If we add 0.05, we get...
We get nothing.
Is this your spot?
No, that's Combescure's spot.
What's your spot?
Here?
Careful. The cup...
Cup... I don't care.
What is it?
Shut up. Shut up.
What is it?
The Castagnier file.
Put it down. Get out.
A nice swim at the beach.
"Greetings from Italy and
stuff the big boss."
Who wrote that?
Not me. Combescure.
I'll get him.
You're fired.
But I created
the Little Bather.
Worthless.
And my kayak's ready.
I'll show it to you.
Stand up.
Your father would never...
-What?
I'm saying: "Your father would
never have done this".
Never speak to me
about my father.
And now disappear...
immediately.
Can I take my things?
Yes, but hurry.
Wait a moment...
do that again.
I'm keeping this one.
Both of them.
You can take the empty one.
You can play with
this at the beach.
Here's your contract.
Do you see?
The contract
for the Little Bather.
Go build your Little Bather
somewhere else.
Is Mr. Fourchaume here?
I think he's at the office.
-Thanks.
Director.
What do you want?
What is it?
Do you want some too?
Mr. Fourchaume?
-He's there.
Can I introduce myself?
What do you want?
I'm from Italy. My name
is Marcello Cacciaperotti.
On behalf of the jury,
I'm awarding you...
...the Oscar for the best sailing boat.
The Little Bather.
This is a joke.
This is a joke.
-No, sir.
Your boat won.
-Won?
The Little Bather? Won?
-Si, signore.
When did that happen?
Yesterday, in San Remo.
I'll check that first.
Don't you believe me?
I do, but I'm
checking anyway.
Miss! Miss!
Miss!
What is it, sir?
Could you call the
police in San Remo?
And ask which boat
got the Oscar?
Yes, Mr. Fourchaume.
-Please.
Stop, there's something
hanging on.
I called San Remo.
The Little Bather really won.
Thank you, miss.
See?
I have a proposition. MONDIAL
BOAT, my company, would like...
Yes, that's you.
And?
...for the whole
Mediterranean region.
I understand.
I already have orders: 200 Little
Bathers before the end of the month.
Oh la la.
Why do you say: "Oh la la"?
Oh la la la la!
Is this a Little Bather?
Yes, a prototype.
I was about to make a change
to it whan you came in.
A prototype?
It doesn't look very reliable.
No, but it is.
Don't. Everything has been numbered.
The screw goes there.
Isn't it a sailing boat then?
That's a secret.
I'm not saying anything.
I'll represent you and I'll
take a small advance.
What?
Yes, you owe me
two million liras.
Before I give anything,
I need to get him back.
I had a tiring day
with that Castagnier.
I first need to get him back,
Yes, bye.
Goodbye, Mr. Fourchaume.
Did it go well?
Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.
Darling, what are you doing here?
I made the biggest mistake
of my entire life.
By not choosing me
for the launch ceremony?
I wish you had done it.
You have to help me
get Castagnier back.
The Little Bather
won yesterday.
Do you know what that means?
He works for you.
He has a contract, doesn't he?
No, I chased him out
yesterday... with a shovel.
And I tore his contract
up in a thousand pieces.
He'll be laughing at you then.
No, because he doesn't know
his boat got the Oscar.
He won't know until Monday. We
have to do something.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
I'll have to ride.
You have to come with me.
I must get him back tomorrow.
It's my last chance.
Monday's too late.
Will you do it? Will you do it?
-Yes.
Dad, what do you
think of Castagnier?
I'm very happy with this
chair. His own design.
He's very good.
Yes, but that chair...
The chair's good. Everything
he makes is good.
And everything he will make,
will be good.
But that chair...
That chair of his
is very good.
Yes, darling.
-See?
The road to Mr.
Castagnier, please.
You have the same tires as me.
Are you happy with them?
The same what?
Tires.
Tires. Are you
happy with your tires?
Yes, they're good. Fine.
It's very easy.
You can't go wrong.
First you go around
the entire vineyard here.
No, the vineyard's there. There.
Then you take the road to Darlot.
And just before Darlot the road
to Madelin. And when you get there...
I can't hear anything.
Opposite the mill,
lives Grogasse.
Gorgasse?
-Grogasse.
And he's married to
André Castagnier's sister.
You'll be there in no time.
It's very easy to find.
You can't get it wrong.
So, first to the right.
Left, right.
Castagnier!
It's not here.
This isn't the barn in Darlot.
Can you hear me?
-Yes.
I couldn't find it.
But it's very simple.
The barn in Darlot.
Where then?
I'll come with you.
That's easier.
Be careful.
How do I get in?
Yours is thinner than mine.
There's no room
for three people.
No, that's impossible.
A pity. I wouldn't
have minded coming along.
Just follow me then.
What a stench.
Close the windows.
I'm going to be sick.
The smell lingers.
The smell lingers inside.
Yes, it's going fine.
Are you still following?
Are we there yet?
Is it here?
No, but it's Sunday.
He's in church.
Thank you,
you're very kind.
When Jesus preached on the mountain,
his last words were...
He who receives you,
receives me.
He who receives me, receives
him who sent me.
And he who receives a man of God,
will be rewarded.
Ask and you shall receive. Daniel.
Seek and you shall find.
Who's that?
-Mr. Fourchaume.
Fourchaume?
What's he doing here?
Knock and the door
shall be opened unto you
Fourchaume is inside.
I know.
Because who seeks shall find and
who knocks shall be opened unto.
And he who has ears,
shall listen.
500 Little Bathers for Italy, 500
for Holland and 750 for Portugal.
Lord, make him sign a contract.
I have faith in you.
500 Little Bathers.
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Dear brothers and sisters,
I had a dream last night.
I had a dream last night.
I dreamt I was in paradise.
I came to paradise to
listen to the Beatitudes.
Peter came to me and asked:
Aren't you Father Castagnier?
I answered Yes, but I
saw a smile on his lips.
Father, do you know what
your church is called here?
No, Peter.
No, Peter.
Our Lady of the Draft.
I won't repeat it. You can
see it with your own eyes.
The beams, the roof and
the bell that has cracked.
The rich should
set an example.
Our statues... this pulpit.
I'll never come here again.
Do you know why the Bishop
doesn't come here anymore?
The last time, he caught
a bronchitis here.
Terrible.
Miss Beaupied passed away
as a result of pneumonia.
Without Vigourlet, we'd
never hear the organ again.
The poor man plays
as well as he can.
So, I'm the Father of
Our Lady of the Draft.
And I envy happy
priests such as...
...my colleague of the
Notre Dame in Parijs...
...whom I never had
the pleasure to meet.
He says mass without having
to wear a woollen cardigan.
I knock on the door
of your heart.
Do not leave me outside.
Open up. Open up.
It's going to be a nice day.
Yes, I insist. You'd
offend me.
Write it out to
Father Castagnier.
He's my brother.
Happy? Now you have
all the Castagniers together.
Scipion... my husband.
What a handsome man.
This is Mernafu.
I know him.
He tried to trip me.
What's wrong with him?
Thank you. We don't see you
often enough.
I'm counting on you on Sunday.
No, not every Sunday.
Charlotte!
The Italian...
Charlotte, how are you?
This is the gentleman from Italy.
Hello.
-André, the gentleman from Italy.
André, everything alright?
What are you doing here?
Come here for a second.
What are you doing here?
I happened to be
in the neighbourhood.
Don't mention the Oscar to
Castagnier, or the liras.
Come to my office,
tomorrow at 10.
Darling, this is Mr.
Mondial Boat.
Marcello Cacciaperotti
A beautiful region, this is.
Very nice. There especially.
A now parishioner.
Another Castagnier.
What a beautiful church.
Unfortunately in a bad state. But
Fourchaume made a gesture.
I'm sorry, but I don't
have any change.
This is enough to please the Father.
Thank you and do come back.
Castagnier, my wife would like
to get to know you better.
She said to me: Lets go to
André on Sunday.
Yes, she always calls you André.
Handy, these things,
aren't they?
I'll push you a bit.
Yes, we work together all week
and hardly know each other.
But we really do get along fine.
What are you doing?
Stay out of it.
He works for me and I push him.
I don't have a problem with it.
But I do.
Well, push him then.
-Ok, see you on Monday.
Stop braking.
-I'm not braking at all.
Wait, wait!
Shall we have lunch together?
I can't. On Sundays, I always
have dinner at my brother's.
Then we'll come with two
cakes for desert. See you later.
Goodbye, Mr. Fourchaume.
-Ah, Father.
This house is always open to you.
I'm counting on you for Sunday.
I already told you.
Goodbye, Mr. Fourchaume.
-Goodbye, madam.
That started well.
Now the rest.
See you on Monday, sir.
Yes, tomorrow's Monday.
Tomorrow.
That's enough.
We have to go.
My foot!
-What's with your foot?
He drove over my foot.
He didn't do it on purpose.
That remains to be seen.
We have to go to the doctor.
If he's home on a Sunday.
Mr. Marchello, could you
take us to the doctor?
What a weight.
Careful with the car, please.
Ouch, damn.
Mind your language, Scipion.
Stuff you.
He's overwhelmed by pain.
Give me your trumpet.
Hurry up. Make room.
Can't you see I'm in pain?
He's got a cow in his tank.
Come on, he's wounded.
Careful. He's in pain.
The one time that
Fourchaume goes to church.
To the right.
We have bad luck. Today
my husband and yesterday André.
What happened to André?
He fired him yesterday.
And he tore up the contract
for the Little Bather.
We have a right
to use the road too.
Who has the Little Bather now?
Nobody.
What?
Well... we have it.
Hurry, hurry.
This is the first time
I see a lighthouse.
Do they live all the way up there?
Come along.
Let them go.
It's good for them.
Henri, go ahead.
Isn't it better to wait here?
No, no. Come along.
He's crazy for coming here.
He said he would.
He's a man of his word.
You shouldn't talk.
He bribed you.
He has a good heart.
Remember your diet.
Isn't that allowed?
Come on, keep going.
I don't know why, but
he's been following me all day.
Can I have the butter?
Maybe he wants to
buy my kayak.
You too?
Wait a moment. Wait a moment.
I'm exhausted.
Come on, darling.
Go on.
They must be
almost upstairs now.
A bit of cork.
It's so high.
And even higher.
He's not here.
Castagnier... he's
pulling our leg.
I'm getting dizzy.
I'm not going down.
What did the doctor say?
In plaster?
Here's André.
Mr. Marcello has a proposition
for the Little Bather.
He's typing a contract for you.
Is it interesting?
I think so. Better
than Fourchaume's contract.
We'll talk about it.
Do you see what I see?
I see nothing.
Look well.
And what do you see?
For red-haired guys...
that's Castagnier.
There he is.
There they come.
They must be feeling alright.
We thought you were upstairs.
Upstairs? No, it's too cold to eat there.
This is ruining my tires.
Do we have far to go?
Another three kilometers.
Aren't you doing alright?
Yes, fine... fine.
Idiot.
My car... my car.
It's broken.
Look at him.
-Help him.
Castagnier! Castagnier!
Come down, Louis-Philippe.
Everything alright?
Yes, fine.
That was great fun.
It's working.
We're there.
Are we there?
-Yes.
The Little Bather.
Do you like it?
My dear Castagnier...
great.
It's so nice here.
What's that?
My house.
A house on the water.
A mini-garden.
How cute.
He has good taste.
A mini-house.
Cute, can we have a look.
Of course.
Go ahead.
A real gangplank.
Mind your head.
Such beautiful oranges.
Did you hurt yourself?
-Not at all.
The same curtains as we have.
A kitchenette.
That's my cup.
What's it doing here?
You didn't want to have it.
That's a lie.
This is my cup.
Do you want to see
the downstairs as well?
Is there more?
There's downstairs too.
There's more.
Go ahead. It's worth it.
Have a look around.
I'll go to the kayak in the meantime.
I'd like to see the kayak.
Home, finally.
Yes, darling. Fourchaume's
there too. I see the car.
Can you help carry Scipion?
They're coming.
They'll help.
What happened to him?
You did that yourself.
You drove away like a maniac.
That's impossible.
You drove over his foot.
A good thing Mr. Marcello was there.
How... how terrible.
Are you in pain?
No, he's not in pain.
It's in his mind.
It's psychological.
In my mind... I wish you'd drive over
your tongue, so you'd feel it yourself.
Show me your leg.
He thinks it hurts.
Psychological.
Take him away.
Look after my car.
My horn.
The doctor said the nerve was almost
damaged. By 2 centimeters.
He would have lost a leg.
It's not that bad. Come on.
That will take 2 weeks at least.
If not a month.
Mind the step.
Finally some peace.
I'll give him some pills
so he'll rest.
I'll help.
No, no, I'll do it.
In the meantime, I'll
give him an injection.
I can do that too.
No, not him.
We'll help him.
Marie-Béatrice, come here.
I'll dry.
You rince, darling.
That's nice.
Has it gone blunt?
No, it's working now.
Mr. Fourchaume!
André's calling you.
Castagnier? I'm coming.
You continue.
I'm going too.
-No.
You never have to get out.
You can keep going on land.
Can I ask you something?
Are you making fun of us?
No, Mr. Fourchaume.
-See, he's not making fun of us.
I didn't say a thing.
Yes, you said he was
making fun of us.
You did say it.
I think it's a
great invention.
It hasn't been sold yet.
You can have it.
For Italy?
-Yes, Venice.
But I'm not from Venice.
I'm from Rome.
Look, what an idiot,
the carrot-head.
André, can you move the
tractor away?
I don't have any time.
Later.
I'll do it myself then.
Mr. Fourchaume, look.
I'm watching.
Interesting.
Are you serious?
-Yes.
Yes, maybe it is interesting.
Look, I'm turning.
I'm worried.
What are you thinking now?
A good idea. I'm going to try it too.
There's a kayak there.
I'll try it myself.
Beautiful, beautiful.
Look. Look. Look.
Did you ever see this?
What an invention.
Brilliant.
Extraordinary.
I'm going to try it.
Connect the paddles.
How do I do that?
Look, I'm rowing.
What an idiot.
Pay attention. I'm going to turn.
He's not very good at that yet.
He's drowning. The idiot.
Are you ok, sir?
We're going to do mouth-to-mouth.
Oh, no, you're not!
It's not working.
It's stuck.
Castagnier!
Castagnier, come.
Charlotte, Charlotte!
What is it?
Go warn Castagnier.
How did they like it?
Where are they?
There's something wrong
with the tractor.
Is Charlotte alright?
Charlotte, what happened?
Come down.
Ready? Ok.
Hold tight.
Is it moving?
-No.
Backwards, Mr. Fourchaume.
I thought of something else.
Marie-Béatrice, in the car.
Come down.
Come down.
Don't be afraid, darling.
Hurry.
How does it stop?
Charlotte!
With the handbrake.
Don't push, pull.
How does it stop?
He's asking how it stops.
Pull the left lever.
Please look after Scipion,
for a moment. Mrs. Fourchaume.
My chickens.
It stopped.
Pull the middle lever down.
Calm down, calm down.
Mr. Fourchaume, pull
the middle lever down.
I don't hear anything. Nothing.
My tree.
My husband will pay for all the damage.
That idiot has to pull
the lever down.
Lever down.
Push the lever down.
How does it stop?
Careful, my white costume.
-Don't lift me.
Sorry.
I don't know how it stops.
The lever.
That guy's giving me a fever.
You'll get a new tractor.
Pull the lever down.
Charlotte, Charlotte!
I'll give you a tranquillizer.
Mr. Fourchaume,
Mr. Fourchaume.
The lights are on.
I can't hear anything.
You're not hurt, are you?
A parrot after a thunderstorm.
Hurry.
He wants to go to the back,
in the garden.
It will stop sooner or later.
When it runs out of petrol.
I heard you had a disagreement
with Mr. Fourchaume.
Disagreement? He sacked me.
Did Charlotte tell you
I have a proposition to make?
We didn't have time
to talk about that yet.
I'll toot when I'm done.
Did you read my contract?
Which contract?
The one I typed at the doctor's.
I gave it to Charlotte.
I typed it myself.
She didn't say anything.
What's happening? He's crazy.
-Excuse me.
Can't you leave me alone?
I want some peace and quiet.
Thanks, Mrs. Fourchaume.
Didn't you give André
my contract?
I'm not really with it today.
Ask Scipion. It's in his pocket.
Good God, what happened?
I'll help you.
No need.
Give me a hand.
I'm down already. Look.
Help! Mr.
Fourchaume's drowning.
Oh, my God. Louis-Philippe.
What's wrong?
Mr. Fourchaume fell in.
His cap, his cap.
He must be there somewhere.
Careful. Give me a hand.
My head.
Darling, does it hurt?
What happened to André?
Don't mention it.
Is your friend from Italy serious?
I don't know.
He made me a proposition
regarding the Little Bather.
What did you say?
But I'll reserve my kayak for you.
I don't want the kayak.
Did you sign for the Little Bather?
Scipion's gone.
How can that be?
My contract...
I'll go get him.
I'll come.
Sit there.
Wait, I'm coming too.
There he is.
No, there.
They can't hear me.
Go, Charlotte. Go, Charlotte.
I won't be long.
Don't rush.
Look at this. How nice.
Did you do that?
Yes, Mr. Fourchaume.
Funny. Did you know I
wasn't always like this?
My grandmother always
called me her Little Bather.
What a coincidence.
Yes, very coincidental.
Before I'd go to sleep,
she'd always sing to me.
You're not going to sing, are you?
Yes, I am.
Go to sleep. You're tired.
Grandma's with you... close your eyes.
In your bed... sweet and small.
You could be little baby Jesus.
Now I've got him.
There he is.
Who?
Why do you always do that?
Were you there?
-Yes.
Me too.
I need to talk business with you.
Then let's go inside.
He can't hear anything.
Did you hear anything?
Her mother used to do this too.
How lovely.
Do you trust me?
Now that we're alone for a moment...
Scipion!
Are you there, Scipion?
That woman's crazy.
Completely crazy.
Why don't you want to
play for Mrs. Fourchaume?
Come along. Hello madam, hello sir.
The little boy will play something.
Yes, yes. Come on.
He doesn't want to.
We came to see Scipion
and we found the big boss.
You're setting a good example.
More bosses should do this. Visit
the employee on a Sunday.
We hardly know each other.
My husband always
says that too, don't you?
Will you come and see
us next week?
The women can talk and
we can have a drink.
To the Little Bather.
Untie the boat.
Scipion's floating away.
There's a strong current.
He's floating towards the sea.
Everybody off the boat.
No, I'm not leaving you.
Everybody off, not you.
What do you like to eat?
I like everything.
He's not a fussy eater.
Why are you here?
I'm coming along to find Scipion.
It's important to me.
To me too.
Untie the rope.
-Can you help?
He took too many pills.
He fell asleep.
Onion tart, how does that sound?
Look.
Faster, André.
There's nobody here anyway.
There's Henri.
Don't push.
No, it's occupied.
Catch!
Do something, André.
They're going to the dam.
I can't go any further.
Careful. The dam!
I can't hear you.
Behind you... the dam!
I'm in the current.
I can't go any further.
Jump!
He can't swim.
We'll get them.
Through the canal, André.
What's happening?
They can't hear us.
André, you have to do something.
Stop!
Are you crazy?
I'm letting go. I'm letting go.
Hurry up.
I'm doing what I can.
They're drowning. They're sinking.
Didn't you see them?
Thanks a lot, you let me down.
What happened?
You fell asleep
because of the pills.
And I tooted as loudly as I could.
You forgot about me aswell.
How could I forget you?
Where's my horn?
I'll buy you a new one.
Did you lose my contract?
No, it's still in his pocket.
Marcello typed it at the
doctor's, remember?
This is my proposition
for the Little Bather.
I'm offering you double
and a share of the profit.
Pull it up. My husband's
still in there.
Quickly, pull it up.
Mind his head.
Quickly, quickly.
He fainted.
He has to go home.
Water!
I'm thirsty.
Any news?
Has the priest arrived yet?
Father Castagnier's with him.
My poor darling.
You rang?
Do you wish to receive them?
Let them in.
Marie-Béatrice,
where are you?
I'm here, darling.
Where's Castagnier?
He's there.
André, I saw the contract.
I can't give you that much.
So you won.
Let's not talk about that now.
Yes, yes, we should talk about it.
It's alright if André
signs the contract.
He can sign it, but not here.
You see? You have
no more competition.
But we could sell the Little Bather
together if you want.
He's getting too tired.
Are you getting too tired?
Yes, he's tiring me.
You're tiring him.
Me?
You have to leave...
leave.
See you later, André.
André.
-Not now.
What does he want?
Little Bather.
He wants the Little
Bather to remain French.
You're getting tired, darling.
What does he want?
He wants to hug you.
I wanted to make you my partner.
All the Castagniers.
André, have a heart.
Sign with him.
Be a good person.
Sign, André.
He got you where he
wanted you, didn't he?
Castagnier, don't sign!
FOURCHAUME AND
CASTAGNIER BROS.
In spite of many unpredictable things
and maybe as a result of them...
What is it?
He's wearing the same
costume as me.
...fate brought us here.
In the name of the Republic
that I represent...
Gentlemen, Fourchaume
and Castagnier...
uncompromising builders of
the Indestructible...
the living and sailing
symbol of our country...
...here and beyond our borders.
I have the contracto
in my pocketo.
Ready?
Father...
In nomine patris et filii
et spiritus sancti. Amen.
Go ahead.
-Go ahead, Mrs. Fourchaume.
Would you hold this,
minister?
