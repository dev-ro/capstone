Early Winter, 2005
Another bottle please
I'm sorry
Where's my drink?
Ma'am, where's the remote?
Drop the knife!
Drop it, you fuck!
Please... don't let him kill me...
Her blood is on your hand now
Ma'am!
Towel!
Stop, you fuck!
Motherfucker!
Stop!
Put your fucking hands
in the air!
That's enough
Turn around!
On your knees!
Hands on your back!
I'll... kill you...
You're scared, aren't you?
You killed her too, didn't you?
What did you do?
Answer me, motherfucker!
I should slit
your mother's throat next
No, not yet
I have big plans
for you later
15 years ago
after killing 10 women
the suspect disappeared
into this dark alley
His statute of limitations expires today
We met up with the lead detective
on the case Lt. Choi Hyung-go
Sir, how about a word to the suspect
who may be watching now
There's one thing
I want to tell you
please stay alive
Korean clicks are just glorified,
low-level hoodlums
I was watching that
Huh?
Buddy!
How dare you switch the channel
when I'm on it!
Lt. Choi, please leave
I can't see you this way any more
Go
Please
Hey, Hyun-sik
Do you remember
how many titles I defended?
Yeah, 6 Asian titles
I wanted to win World Championship
and place the belt on mom's grave
Hyun-sik, are you home now?
Let's talk in person
I was pretty much an orphan
after what happened to mom
You treated me like your real brother
I won't forget it
Hyun-sik!
Jung Hyun-sik!
Hyun-sik!
What are you doing up there!
How'd your mom feel if she saw you
like this in heaven?
You have to see him suffer and die!
You can do this after that!
I know how you feel,
so come down and let's talk
Hyung-go, I'm sorry...
Hyun-sik!
Jung Hyun-sik, 1973-2005
CONFESSION OF MURDER
2 years later, late autumn, 2007
Hyung-go! You got a call!
Answer your phone!
Still dead of the night!
What? What time is it mom?
I'm sick and tired of your drunken
stupor!
Answer it!
Gwang-su, I told you
I help mom on weekends
new cases can wait until Monday!
Help me with what,
you do nothing but sleep!
When did I not help?
What?
Turn what on?
Lee Doo-suk, the author of
'Confession of Murder'
revealed that he is the killer of an
unsolved serial killing case
that shook the nation 17 years ago
The press conference is already heating up
due to the fact that the writer confessed
after the expiration of statute of limitations
Lee Doo-suk is stepping in now
Thank you everyone for coming
to the launching press conference
This book was written to
sincerely repent for his crimes,
so please refrain any offensive questions
Yes?
What's the point of confessing
after evading formal investigation,
and committing the perfect murder?
'The point of confessing'...
It may be hard to believe...
but I'd say it's out of guilt
And I wish others
would share my guilt
Guilt trip after all these years?
What a load of shit
Can you let him continue?
Let's hear him out
Mr. Lee!
As you can see you'll be criticized
and chastised mercilessly,
are you afraid of anything?
My confession will bring immediate chaos,
but I hope these ghastly cases
do not occur through this book
You're a very handsome man
How do you take care of your skin?
That's the best you can do?
We shouldn't allow
female reporters to question
Is there a proof that you're the real killer?
You'll find sufficient descriptions
of the murders in the book
And Lt. Choi!
I guess he's not here today
I'm sorry... for what I did to you
Honey, isn't he talking about you?
The bullet that Lt. Choi fired,
is still inside me
This is an x-ray of the slug
Can you show us your bullet wound?
It'll be distributed nationally tomorrow,
and online reservation starts midnight today
We wish for your glowing endorsement
The site is overloaded
Please try again later
Shit, I was gonna read for a change...
Can you give us a comment?
Tell us how you feel! Mr. Lee!
How do you feel?
Will you give me some room!
Mr. Lee, why don't you repent tomorrow
when it's sunny?
Did you pick today because of the rain?
Let's just to this tomorrow!
- Give me that umbrella!
- This is mine!
Doctor! Doctor! How do you feel?!
How do you feel?!
A comment please!
Please accept... my apology...
Snap m
Mr. Lee! How do you feel now?
One comment please!
Mr. Lee Doo-suk!
Will you repent to remaining
families of the victims too?
I'm stunned...
So he's the real killer,
but no way to lock him up
You sure about that?
Will you take responsibility for it?
I don't even co-sign for my clad,
why would I do that?
I'm just saying
Idiot...
Don't you agree?
You were there too
A fraud can't be this vivid
with the details, it's bulletproof
Bulletproof?
Nothing's ever without holes
You're talking about
the last missing case,
that's probably not his work
I thought this was a violent crime unit?
When did it become a library?
It looks nice!
Well, isn't this the tragic hero,
Mr. Choi?
What's with you?
You're a celebrity now, fucker
In any case,
is that bastard Lee real deal?
So what if he is,
we can't even lock him up any more
Lee Doo-suk may not be the killer, idiot!
Look at his face
does he look like a killer?
Don't you smell something fishy?
Come on, sniff!
I think I smell Chinese, sir
Your meal's here!
Did you wait for the cue?
How could you eat Chinese
at a time like this?
You can't figure out what's
what with an empty stomach, goddammit!
What did you just say, asshole?!
So we starve until the job's done?
It's not like we can afford
anything other than Chinese anyway
You're crawling up my ass lately
I'd fire you, if you weren't
my Academy junior...
I'm hungry.
Order us some too!
Yo Chink, let's make another drop
3 noodles and plenty of radish
You slutty whores,
get your own fucking radish!
Look at this fucking asshole
- I'll...
- Hey!
What a fucking horror case
Lt. Choi! Lee Doo-suk wishes to
formally offer his apology,
Out! Everyone out!
This is a police station,
not a street market!
400,000 copies sold in 3 clays,
as the former officer in charge,
what's your opinion on the matter?
Could we do this after lunch?
Is he referring to you when he said
'someone will feel the guilt'?
Get out!
Get out now!
God damn it!
Let me eat in peace!
- Please tell us!
- Everyone out!
It's Lee Doo-suk!
Please step out of the way
Mr. Lee!
What are you up to?
It's been a while, Lieutenant
Get that hand out of my face
Is this your entourage?
Not so happy to see me
after all these years?
Come on, smile for the camera
- Shut your fucking trap!
- Same old foul mouth.
Holy shit!
Is he nuts?!
Move aside!
Yo Lee, have you eaten yet?
What?
Eat this shit, motherfucker!
Have some more!
HEY! give me the gun!
Mr. Kang Do-hyuk
Who are you?
Welcome back
'Amateur HQ' sign would complete the look
I'll be with you!
My bladder's about to burst,
should I piss in my pants?
Shit!
You, you're Kang-sook?
Get your pants up
That brat, not a shred of shame!
This is all there is to victims' families?
After inquiring around,
only a few of us will get involved
in this matter
Forget it
But madam, do we have to
get involved ourselves?
Aren't there some shady men
you can hire?
Look! A white snake!
Do-hyuk's here!
You've grown old
Want a bowl of snake soup?
Drop this nonsense and sit down!
Couldn't assemble
a worst group even if I tried
'Confession of Murder' is
breaking bestseller records,
He's so radiant
You gotta be beautiful
even to commit crimes nowadays
It's his willingness to repent
that makes him attractive
Why don't you join his fan club then?
Fan club? I'm too old for that...
but I should try.
Are we celebrating his stint on our show?
Station chief, we were able to get Lee...
So did you get the Lieutenant or not?!
Sir, I think we need to
rethink about Choi
The last outburst is reason enough...
If we put them in the same room
during a live show,
we can't predict what he'll do
Get them, whatever it takes!
Or clear out your desks!
Chief, it's not that...
He could shoot him dead on the air!
Producer Park,
if he kills on live television,
it'll be an exclusive, a major one!
Get Choi!
What did he whisper
before you stuffed his face?
He asked me to do it
Look how well he manipulates the media
He comes off as a saint
I'm using the media too!
Sure, you're giving them
plenty to write about
idiot...
By the way, my spidey senses are tingling
I think he has an ulterior motive
Repent, clean up his image
and start a business
Like those celebrities
Stop your yapping
You got a call
Hello?
Yes, this is he
What debate?
How do you control the media so well?
It was so clever to repent to the doctor
One clean slap!
If you went to those other hicks,
they'd have tried anything to
get a piece of the pie!
And what a brilliant idea to seek Choi!
You planned this all, didn't you?
So smart
You already know
what'll happen at the debate, right?
No, thank you
It's too early to celebrate
You don't smoke, nor drink
You take care of yourself too much
Is this funny?
That a killer is taking care of himself?
Is it?
No, it looks good...
You're a celebrity now,
you must maintain your image
Should I reserve a skin clinic?
Fuck that shit
Kidnap?
I'll do it myself, just sit back
and have some ice cream
Load of shit
If you kill him before I find out
where my daughter is buried
I will kill you myself
Kill me?
You will?
Are we your pawns?
Why should I risk my life
for your daughter?
Hey!
Go, do your own thing
What did I tell you
we don't need village idiots
who get locked up
What did you say?!
Do you know why I was locked up?
I was out looking for this Lee fucker
and I stabbed the wrong bastard
in the stomach!
Whenever I saw someone similar
I went after him with a knife in my hand!
Do you know what I wish for the most?
I pray to God to let me kill him
with my own hands!
And now that he's out,
you get together for a tea party?!
You make me sick!
Sick? Does it look like
we're having a ball?
Does it?
You're not the only one in pain
Every night in my dreams
the scream of my dying child
echoes in my head
He doesn't deserve an easy death
I want to cut off his limbs
and watch him tremble in pain
and beg for his life
That reason alone kept me alive
I know how you feel, sir
And I know you're suffering too
But won't you let me remove that scar?
This is like a trophy for a detective
And how dare I remove
the scar he gave me?
I know what you're going through,
but don't torture yourself
'Confession of Murder' Book Signing
What's your name?
It's me
Don't you recognize me?
Your name is...
Choi Hyung-go, motherfucker!
Look how popular you are, shitface
Look at this line-up
Breaking the bank?
Let go of me, you fucks!
Why are you here, Lieutenant?
I'm here on a government duty
Check out this tough guy
I should get your autograph instead
How does it feel to work for him?
Licking his asshole for a buck, huh?
Sell a ton, motherfucker!
His security detail and cops are
always at official events
What else does he do?
He rents out the entire swimming pool
at Ecograd Hotel for 30 minutes
The entire pool?
Being in public would
compromise his safety
He's got money to burn,
and it's good publicity for the hotel
He killed our ladies for
a dip in their blood, huh?
But wouldn't he have
his bodyguards at the pool?
Sure, but they won't swim alongside
So, what do you want to do?
The plan starts with you
Sir!
What is it?
Sir! Sir!
Sir!
Are you alright?
Call 119 Now!
Snap out of it!
How long since the bite?
About 5 minutes
Will he be okay?
Yes, he'll be okay with this antidote
Help us lift him
Which district are you from?
Yongsan district
We're from Yongsan
I think there was
a miscommunication
Clearly there was a mistake,
and say hello to my knife!
One of you will die by this knife!
Get back!
I'll hold them back, get going!
Daddy, just go!
We can't leave him!
He can take care of his own ass!
Get back!
Get them!
Eat this!
Stop!
Give me your hand!
Come on!
Hit the brake!
Sir, get in!
Why the hell
did they kidnap him in my turf?
Have you traced his location?
His security detail's on them
They're southbound from Sinlim
Sir, where are you now?
I'm right on them!
It's not mom...
Pumpkin, it's alright
Tell me she's okay
Mom's fine
- Lt. Choi's on your tail!
- Choi?
What just happened?!
Don't you see, he's onto us!
Step on it, old man!
OK
Step on it!!
I'm stepping on it!
Why doesn't it go any faster?!
Shut up!
Do something!
Will you shut up?!
He's gonna get us this way!
Oh, jeez
We can't get caught
Shit!
Stop the car!
Huh?
Shit, what do we do?
What are you doing!
I'll kill you!
Crazy fuckers!
Give me your hand!
I don't believe this
Grab my hand!
Smash him!
Shit, get close!
Fucker!
Watch out!
Are you fucking nuts!
Stop the car!
Stop!
Hey fucker
Dying!
Pull!
Slow down!
Daddy, stop!
Pumpkin, are you alright?!
Get off of me!
What are you up to?!
Just watch!
Eat this, you fucks!
Goddammit!
I'm serious
It happened so fast,
we couldn't do anything
Answer me straight, baldie!
How could there be snakes
in a hotel pool?!
I'm serious sir!
He was bitten and we called 911
And they showed up as if
they were on standby?
That's right
Fuck“.
They really planned this out
Lt. Choi!
You can't come in here!
Let's get out of here!
Lt. Choi, a word please!
Have you identified the abductors?
Lt. Choi, a word please!
Kang-sook and her dad live
in the mountain, so no fixed address
Do-hyuk was released 2 days ago
and won't be easy to track
Should I look into their cells?
They're not stupid enough
to use their own cells!
Wait, can 911 call be intercepted?
Oh!
That's probably impossible
I'm heading home for a bit
look into how one might
rent an ambulance
Sure
According to the rumors
the abductors are
the victims' families, is this true?
Don't draw your own conclusion!
Do you think he saw us?
He's not deaf, dumb and blind!
We were all over his car
So it's not the victims' families?
Are you all having fun?
Are you?!
Go away!
Could you use gentle words on TV?
Will you turn that off?
That temper of yours...
Hyung-QU
how about we get rid of the car wash
and start a coffee shop?
Stop talking nonsense
and help me put this on
I hear the women love
running coffee shops nowadays
Start a coffee shop
with your retirement money
find a wife and live happily ever after!
You know I make tasty coffee, right?
Oh, mom...
Women don't drink old fashion coffee
They only drink coffee those guys make
ameripresso or something
You don't know anything
Why are you putting that on!
You're supposed to put this on!
You should have told me!
Do I have to spell it out?
Just forget it!
I'm out for a few clays,
so don't call!
Where did he get that temper?
In the light of Lee Doo-suk's abduction
the bereaved families
have turned into suspects...
How about I talk to them instead?
They planned this meticulously,
they won't back down so easily
What did you find out?
I got a hunch, so I looked into
special prop vehicles
Here, Kim... Ong-go?
Kim Yong-go
Someone named Kim Yong-go
outright bought it
Do you feel the tingle?
Yeah ?
Dig further and report back
Yes, sir!
I went through a lot of trouble
to borrow this
Why do you need this anyway?
Do I have to report that to you?
To me you do!
Dammit, you startled me!
Are you going to Iraq?
Since it's collecting dust,
I thought I'd clean my attic with it
You'll do what?
Give me your car key
You take me for an ass wipe?
You're not an ass wipe
I'll bring Lee in myself!
Kim Yong-go is a private click
His client is Jung Tae-suk,
Han Ji-soo's son
Han Ji-soo?
Woori Seafood's chairman?
Yes, there's Jung's cell number too
Get Unit 3 to track their location
His location?
But we need a warrant for that,
it'll take some time
There is none, asshole!
Detective, I can do that instantly
One moment sir.
What?
Our specialty is infidelity,
precise and immediate solution
As soon as they enter the motel zone,
we can track their location
within one minute!
As soon as they cum,
we're all over them
Happy with your work?
YES
Sir, we can track him from here
Okay, then do it
What am I supposed to look at?
Got him?
Yes sir, we got his location now
Where is he?
He's heading to Osan from Suwon
Osan? How far away from me?
7km, sir
Osan IC
Okay, he's on Osan IC!
- Which highway?
- 23, sir!
- How far away?
- 3km!
- What about now?
- You're almost on him!
I got him!
Should I send support?
- No, standby!
- Sir?
Don't contact anyone
until I call you back
What will you do?
How you're going to use it?
He's... he's waking up!
You son of a bitch!
Wake up!
Snap out!
Wake up!
Lee Doo-suk
Where's my child?
Jung Su-yun
What did you do to her?
Jung Su-yun...
Yes, Jung Su-yun!
Lieutenant...
What did you do to her?!
What did you do!
What's this?
Blackout?
Does anyone have a cell phone?
Here
What the hell's going on?
Holy shit!
Don't do that, old man!
Don't just stand there,
get the switch!
Fuck off
I think something just moved
What moved?
Are you ok?
What the fuck was that?!
Turn on the light!
I can see you,
don't do anything stupid!
- Be quiet
- What have you got?
- I'm not lying
- What is it?
Stay calm!
Lee Doo-suk!
Where's my daughter?!
Tell me where she is!
Tell me! Where is she?!
Please tell me!
Please tell me!
Are you alright?
- Who are you?
- What's wrong? What do you see?
Who's there?!
Who are you?!
Shut up!
Lee Doo-suk's gone!
Where did he go? Find him!
- I got him! I got him!
- Let go, that's my leg!
- Daddy, over there!
- Where?
Goddammit!
Stop right there!
No!
That crazy bitch!
Dammit...
I told you we should've killed him!
The abductors were my overzealous fans
They simply acted out
their innocent fantasy
and I came back in one piece
So you won't press any charges
against your abductors?
That's correct
I'm the one at fault,
how could I blame them?
Will you still attend next week's
televised debate?
Of course
It's not just a promise with the network
- 1' believe that this program...
- Lieutenant!
What the hell happened to my car!
Did you drive through a shootout?
You got insurance
That fuck
he's got media on his fingertip
represents my way of
apologizing to the public
Will you really go on TV?
I don't know!
It's nice to cover
for the victims' families
but we got arrest rate
to consider too
Shut the fuck up!
Where is Hyung-QU!
Choi Hyung-go! What is that?!
Did you let that happen?
He said he walked out of there
You said you were gonna bring him!
But he walked out on his own,
what was I supposed to do?
Goddammit!
Pumpkin
Where are you going?
Gonna go fishing, I feel stuffy
It's chilly now,
don't stay out too long
Yeah
Daddy...
Yeah?
Don't worry, go to sleep
Alright, pumpkin!
Lieutenant, please sit over here
Yo imposter,
you're a celebrity now?
You're a bit late, Lieutenant
I'm sorry you wrecked your car
because of me
Thank you for
always looking out for me
You think I got some time to kill?
AD, here's the last commercial
Last commercial!
Please don't doze off,
just stay awake for 100 minutes!
Cue!
Over 3 million copies sold in one month,
estimated profit of $20 million,
serial killer-turned-bestselling author,
Lee Doo-suk
Why is he repenting after causing
so much pain?
Welcome to Public Debate
1 am your host Son long-hak
The success of 'Confession of Murder'
is quite startling
Shall we start the debate
with the main factor for its popularity?
Yes, professor Jung
That's a simple question to answer,
it's because the author is a serial killer
Using expiration of statute of limitations
as a reason to confess with a book
it's the best marketing strategy, isn't it?
Perhaps he only killed those women,
only to write and market this book
Sir, your creative liberty is off the charts
Sure it is
But this clearly shows an ulterior motive
With the publishing of the book,
the author is raking in
a massive amount of wealth
through his crime
Wait, what evidence do you have
to back up this view?
One moment please,
let's clear the air
As expected, the debate is
already heating up
Ms. Jang, haven't you evaluated him
before his book was published?
At the time, Mr. Lee confessed that
his heinous crime would deter others,
and play a small role
in preventing further atrocity
Just thinking about our session
makes me misty
He talked about that
and cried tears of remorse
Please compose yourself
I'm so sorry
During our pre-interview,
Lt. Choi defiantly stated that
Lee Doo-suk is not the real killer
Do you have any concrete proof?
To his fans' disappointment,
he'll be arrested soon
For fraud
Between 1986 and 1990,
10 women were murdered
Another went missing in that period
but her remains are yet to be found
I am certain that this is also
the work of the serial killer,
and this was his final kill
Answer to his accusation is simple
I did not commit that last crime
Or you just don't have access
to the information regarding it
Then do you remember
what you said to me
when we met that night?
Well, what did I say?
Unlike you,
it wasn't a pleasant night for me
Don't people rely on
the power of forgetfulness
more than memory?
Forgetfulness?
You certainly talk the talk
like a con artist
Did you just say... con artist?
Did I hear that right?
As a human rights lawyer,
I find that offensive
Woman, was I talking to you?
Lt. Choi
One moment please
I must apologize
Let's change the pace
and get to the calls
You're on the air,
what is your name and city?
I'm Lee Bong-ryun,
and I own a bookstore in Busan
What is your opinion?
The book is selling like hotcakes,
so I wanted to personally thank Mr. Lee...
You're such a hottie,
thanks for everything
Speaking of which,
how about a book from Mr. Choi too?
Thank you for your comment
concerning the need for diverse books
in order to revitalize
the publishing industry
Let's get to the next caller
You're on the air,
what is your name and city?
As a civil figure,
could 1' stay anonymous?
Please call me ' ♪
Yes, of course
What is your opinion?
As a fan of Mr. Lee,
I wanted to ask a few things
Do you know how fast
Lt. Choi runs the 100m?
Well...
I'm told that in his prime,
he did it in 12 seconds
You used alleys and roofs
during your chase,
you must've avoided
straightaways for this reason
Now that I think about it, I think so
Also, I read that you performed
a judo flip to pin him down
Do you know judo
or other martial arts?
Do I have to be a judo player
to use that technique?
No, but I majored judo
at College of Physical Education
But I'm not a muscle head,
I play an instrument too
And cook quite well
I'm sorry, could you state
your opinion please?
Ah, right
Do you know that the Lieutenant
is terrible with time?
He was late today too
He should really get a good watch
By the way...
I see it now,
you're his fan, not mine
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?
You really don't get it, do you?
No, I really don't know
This is why I was never caught
Huh?
J, what do you mean?
Lee Doo-suk, don't put on a show
What a load of shit...
You don't honestly believe that, do you?
Lt. Choi!
Gwang-su!
Lt. Choi!
Have you tracked him?
I'm working on it
Get me the location now!
Dangsan-dong,
#260
What?!
- She's not answering?
- Shit!
Sir! How could you tell us that now?!
How was I supposed to know?
I thought she needed some fresh air
You fed her too much snake!
She's out for blood!
If Lee is not the killer,
we're really fucked
The public is in a state of turmoil
A comment please!
Mr. Lee, how do you respond?
- Who could be doing this?
- Is the caller the real killer?
Please don't get swayed by
a prank caller desperate for attention
Everyone has the right to speak his mind,
but it should not be a lie
What the hell happened?!
What's going on?!
Someone do something!
Over there!
Take the picture!
I told you I'd slit
your mother's throat if you piss me off
Where's your mother?
Where is he...
Where is this fuck!
Come out, motherfucker!
Come out, motherfucker!
- Come out, you fuck!
- Lieutenant!
- Come out here!
- Lieutenant!
Come out here!
- Come out, you fuck!
- Lieutenant!
What are you doing?!
You're waking up the entire city
in the middle of the night!!
- Mom...
- Are you all drunk?
Are you okay?
Why are you sleeping in my room?
I told you my heater's broken!
What's with you,
you're not being yourself!
Stay put for a bit
What's got into you all of sudden?
Gwang-su...
Yes sir?
Stay with my mom for a moment
Sir?
- Where are you going?
- Hyung-go!
Watch the road!
I'll take it out
Goddammit!
Why did you dress me up for?
You're gonna kill me anyway
Please, let me hear his voice

Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?
Why did you hit the victim then!
Detective, I'm the victim here!
Hello? What do you want?
Please don't kill me...
I... want to live...
Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?
Why did you hit the victim then!
Detective, I'm the victim here!
Hello? What do you want?
Why did you hit the victim...
Detective, I'm the victim here!
Hello? What do you...
Detective, I'm the victim here!
I want to live...
Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?
Why did you hit the victim then!
Detective, I'm the victim here!
Hello? What do you want?
Gwang-su
Yes?
Call a press conference
Find anything?
Tell them I got a major scoop
What's that?
Let's put on a show too
This is a knife that was sent in by J,
who claims to be the real killer
After analyzing the blood on it,
NIS confirmed that it matches my own
Then are you confirming that
J is the real serial killer?
So Lee Doo-suk is an impostor?
We cannot draw a conclusion right now
The slug in his shoulder matches
the type that I used at the time,
and while his lack of knowledge
on the final case is questionable,
the details he wrote
in the book are so accurate
that only the killer could've written it
So who's the real killer then?
That is all for now
What the hell...
So, they don't know who the real killer is
Considering that J sent in the actual knife,
could he be the real thing?
Of course not
Don't forget that Lee wrote the book
He couldn't have wrote it
without being there
Alright!
Let's get to the next round!
We get all three of them
in the debate
We can get Choi and Lee to the table,
but there's no way to get J
You're getting paid to find a way
Producer Park, get the exclusive
But we don't even know J's number...
Then put out an ad
You're not even trying to do your job!
- Is the knife the most decisive evidence?
- Hello?
Does this mean J is the real killer?
Treat those reporters
with some respect
Who the hell is this?
Don't you recognize my voice?
Buddy! Can't you see the red light?!
I'm sorry
Who the fuck is this?
Your mom was working alone today,
why don't you help for once!
You son of a!
Keep them out!
Yes, Lieutenant
Who did you just talk to?
There are many people here
You call yourself a cop?!
What crawled up his ass?
These were taken by my bodyguard
during my abduction,
the knife is missing,
while cash is intact
It looks like an elaborate ploy
to take credit as the serial killer
by stealing my evidence
I don't know who this J is
but he sure is an amateur
I will provide further detail at
press conference tomorrow
How long are you gonna
let Lee run wild like that?
Feeling cocky because of
a security detail at the car wash?
I should've slit her throat
when I had the chance
Who the fuck are you?
Really?
You still don't know?
'I'm the real killer,
help me convince the world',
is that why you called?
Of course,
you're my ace in the hole
That's why I let you live,
you forgot?
Are you getting worked up?
The killer I chased was a calm fucker
Why do you insist
Jung Su-yun's dead?
Hello?
What?
Are you serious?
Could you tell us how you feel now?
Are the hospital staff treating you well?
You claim that] stole your knife
from your room, is this true?
Yes! I think he went after
the rights to my identity
but he couldn't be any more wrong
Today, I plan to donate
the entire $21 million that I earned
through the sale of my book
to the victims' families
whose lives I caused so much pain
What a fucking load of shit!!
Who's gonna clean that mess!
And I do not wish to press charges
against the woman who attacked me
Looks like my baby will be released
Did he really... repent for what he did?
Maybe... It doesn't look like
a simple publicity stunt
It's all due to my past crimes...
He's not trying to
get rich off the book,
he'll definitely open a restaurant soon
But what kind?
Sushi? Or barbecue?
Ah, steak house! It's perfect!
Lee Doo-suk Steak House,
can't you feel it? No?
- What? Is that true?
- What? Where?
Live broadcast? Now?
Are you hoping to get into politics?
Pretending to be humble
by taking credit for my work
Let me make a suggestion
Idiot cop, great actor and I,
how about a three-way chat?
On national television
Mr. Lee, it'll be a good chance for you
to prove your claim,
will you accept?
Do you accept the mediation?
He's an interesting character
Sure, I'll accept
J! Give us your number!
Under me is the evidence
that'll prove that I'm the real killer
I'll forward the location
3 hours before the debate
What are you...
Why are you writing on the tree?
Hey you! What're you doing?
Comply to all his requests,
and put 10 guards on him
Can't let anything happen to him
Do-hyuk will go undercover as TV crew
You'll disguise as forklift operator
and pretend to install blockades
with me at the station
What about her?
I'll be in the audience
What, gonna clap and cheer?
If you allow me, once he's verified,
I would like to kill him myself
Seriously?
You won't find your daughter's body then
I will bury her,
in my heart
Sir...
What's this?
Today is the day of Public Debate
that'll get to the bottom of this mystery
The debate will determine
who the real killer of a cold case is
Lt. Choi, who was
in charge of the investigation,
as well as the author of confessional
'Confession of Murder' Lee Doo-suk,
and J, who sent in
never before seen evidence,
J will all attend in person
to uncover the truth once and for all
Choi, one of them is the real killer,
so don't lose him!
I don't care if it's live broadcast,
I'll take full responsibility
Lee Doo-suk is the real killer!
Real killer! Real killer!
J is an impostor!
Impostor!! Impostor!
Why is that witch here?
Everyone get ready!
Since J isn't here yet,
we'll start with the victims' families
Standby!

Cue!
Welcome to Public Debate,
I am your host Son Jong-hak
Today we will find out once and for all,
who the real serial killer is
by talking to Lee Doo-suk,
Lt. Choi Hyung-go and J,
who claims that Lee is taking credit
for his crimes
We've received a word from J
that he's almost at the station
We apologize on his behalf for his absence
We'll start the debate
with Dr. Kim Joon-bum,
as the representative
of the victims' families
What are you waiting for?
Get him the mike!
I haven't yet let my deceased daughter
out of my mind and heart
Producer Park, J is at the back entrance
Then dispatch the cams to the back!
- Knowing the real killer would...
- One moment
Ladies and gentlemen,
J has just arrived
We have the footage now
J is approaching the studio
Get out! get out!
The mask is very striking
Okay, he's here
J is him...
J will be arriving shortly
This way, please sit over there
Please be quiet for a moment
Mr.J
As you're here to prove your identity,
will you comply to the request
to remove your mask?
J has finally revealed
his face to the world
Lt. Choi, how do you feel?
Is Jung Su-yun alive?
You'll find that out soon
It's true that I killed 10 women,
so perhaps] killed Ms. Jung
The truth will be revealed soon
Sir, I think that's J's signal
OK!
We're ready to connect
to the offsite feed!
As per J's request,
we have crew standing by
- Let? connect to them now.
- Remote feed, cue!
We are at a hill near Ansan
We received a report that
Ms. Jung Su-yun,
the 11th victim
of the serial killing is buried here,
and begun the excavation
As you see behind me...
Looks like we found something
We finally see a glimpse
of the remains
After 17 long years,
she can finally rest peacefully
You're watching
live excavation of Jung Su-yun
She was wearing a white coat
at the time of her abduction
You fucking!
Take this
I believe in you
Friendship is your support
Orion Chocopie
That J bastard must be the real killer!
No, don't give up hope!
Mama
Don't lose faith in Lee!
Don't lose faith!
J must've killed just her,
and Lee killed the rest!
Lieutenant, don't get so emotional
Let's be rational about this
You're making it look like
he's the real thing
Everyone, please calm down
We're back in 4 and a half minutes
Step off the stage, please!
What are you doing?!
Who said to interrupt the show!
We almost allowed profanity on live TV!
This is not on the scale of
normal broadcast accidents!
Do you know how much
this is costing us?
Chief!
FCC will press charges,
and there won't be a show!
If we continue like this,
aren't I fucked?
I don't know...
If not you, then who?
Chief said he'll take care of everything
That bastard...
I'm the station chief
Clear out your desk!
Fuck this, I'm done!
- Producer Park, don't do this!
- Let go!
Broadcast is power?
Eat your own shit!
Get out!
Lieutenant,
you didn't actually think that
she was still alive, right?
You son of a bitch!
Come out!
You're fucking dead!
Out of the way!
Motherfucker!
Do-hyuk, that's enough...
I'm gonna find him and kill him!
More women are being killed
because I haven't stopped him yet
Honey! Look at my face
Look at me
Yo! Jung Su-yun!
I'm getting the short end of the stick,
but since you need me so desperately,
I, Choi Hyung-go, will
marry you!
Can't we live together?
I want to live together!
I never said that.
Sounds nothing like me
Don't be too hard on yourself
I got it
Mom'll be here soon
What time is it?
It's dead again
I'll buy you a new watch
It works great with some care, like me
Then I need to give you some love too
Feel better?
Go on in
There's that smile
Go on
Okay, I'm off
Hello
Have I not made myself clear?
I thought it'd be dangerous
for her to walk home alone
Being with you is more dangerous
Shall we? It's almost time
I can only imagine your shock
as you witness this at home
DNA test must be conducted
before we can verify that this is Jung
Are you kidding?
Do I have to cook the meal
and feed it to you too?
Lt. Choi, it's just a matter of time,
why don't you just come clean now?
Lt. Choi?
Then Mr. Lee,
do you still stand by your statement
that you killed 10 women?
I...
Yes, go on
am not...
the serial killer
You... are not the serial killer?
Quiet please
Please be quiet!
This is all very confusing
Then how were you able to
obtain vivid details of the case
that only the real killer would know?
Because I...
did not write it
Then who wrote the book?
I wrote the book
What are you saying?
Lee Doo-suk's real name is Jung Hyun-sik
The first victim was...
my mother
Wait a moment...
This is Jung Hyun-sik's file
We researched the victims' families,
and found out that
the son of first victim, Jung Hyun-sik,
died in an accident on the year
when the statute of limitations expired
That day, Jung died and
Lee was born in his place
But there's not a trace of similarity
between the two
I can explain that
It was winter of 2005
We were barely able to stabilize him,
but his face took a serious damage
that required reconstructive surgery
So you created Lee with plastic surgery?
It was Choi's suggestion
and Hyun-sik also wanted it
So Lt. Choi planned this scheme
to weed out the real killer?
Even writing a book as part of the plan...
You're a megalomaniac
who desires national attention
So you chose to kill
and I became part of your PR stunt
If someone became famous
with that book,
who'd be most jealous of it?
I am so thankful,
I am so thankful,
that you bit the bait so willingly
Lt. Choi, I'm stunned,
I underestimated you
But with me legally off the hook,
why did you go through the trouble?
Oh, is it because of her?
Jung Su-yun?
I needed to catch you!
And ask you,
whether she's dead or alive,
and where she's buried
Then I was going to kill you
But that's not what she would've wanted,
so I'm hesitating now...
What do you mean?
Bring it
I don't know why you're making a scene
Just show us already,
and get it over with
Please let me...
hear his voice one last time
Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?
Why did you hit the victim then!
I know where you're going with this
You want to stir up public emotion,
is that it?
That I'm the devil who mercilessly killed
an innocent woman?
It feels even more tragic
with your voice in it
You must be really nervous now...
Shut your trap and listen
- Hello? Hello?
- The ballot count for...
14th presidential election is
being conducted
We'll continue shortly
- It is now midnight.
- Hello? What do you want?
Speak!
Did you hear it?
The 14th presidential election ballot count
That was midnight December 19, 1992
Today is December 18, 2007,
11:46pm
There's still 14 more minutes of
statute of limitations!
Lieutenant!
We became close
while living together for 2 years
She always said,
she wanted you to live on
without guilt
She thought of you
until the moment she was buried
I'm sorry,
please forgive me
Please let me live
I want to live...
I have to live
There is a reason why I must live
No, you can't kill me
I have... your child
Shut your mouth!
Goddammit, that hurts!
Blood...
I was mindful of her period,
but she ended up getting pregnant
She thought I wouldn't kill her with a child
But I loathe children more than anything
Looks like you went all out
for her revenge,
but you should've done it
before time ran out
You didn't have to drag me out on TV,
this is so pitiful!
Please lower your gun...
Sir...
It's all over now
You're right,
I was wrong
I shouldn't be so pitiful
Right?
Not in her loving memory...
It's my fault
But this is the end for us!
No, Lieutenant!
Let go!
- Let go of me!
- Please calm down!
Su-yun's mother's blood
is on your hand now
Take the other side!
Your mom said to me as she died,
her son would be all alone...
You grew up quite well
Shut the fuck up!
Shit!
I'll kill you!
Goddammit!
Stop!
Stop right there!
Hold Still!
Fuck!
Fucking hell!
Fuck!
Fucking hell!
I'll fucking kill you!
Just load the whole thing!
Underneath!
Crush him!
Key! Give me the key!
Give it back!
That's not mine
Move it!
Goddammit!
No, I'm so fucked...
Are you okay?
Are you alive?
You Okay?
I know you...
Lt. Choi, right?
Sir, are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Fuck!
J is seen heading towards Ilsan
on a stolen motorcycle
Where the fuck is he?!
Fucking hell!
Go to hell!
It's all over in 3 minutes, fucker!
I'll fucking kill you!
Lieutenant!
Are you okay?
Come down! please!
Hold them back!
Block him!
Let go!
Let me go!
He has to die!
Let go!
Sorry for making you wait
Why are you so late?
I'm bogged down with the case,
I have to rush back
What should we eat?
Why don't you just quit now?
Not even a proper dinner
with your lover on Christmas eve
How will you ever marry
a cop this way?
I'm starting to understand your mother
If you do, then breaking up is an option?
My mom bothers you that much?
Come on
I...
want to...
live with you
Go on, I gotta run
Can't even take me home?
It'd be awkward to see your mother
You're selfish
Early winter, 2012
Lt. Choi Hyung-go completed
his 5-year sentence
for the murder of serial killer
and was released today
This case also initiated the process of
extending the statute of limitations
to 25 years from 15
Allow yourself to heal
Thank you...
Won't you remove...
that scar now?
This belongs to Su-yun's
husband Hyung-go
