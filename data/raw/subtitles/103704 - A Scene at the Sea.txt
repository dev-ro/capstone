It looks like rain
Don´t worry
The old lady at the tobacco shop predict it
Look, is that Shigeru ?
It´s him
He started surfing
Hey ! Shigeru !
.
What if it hits him
He won´t be mad
He´s gone
Where is he ?

That´s him
.
Watch Out
.
Totally can´t
Really ?
Is it ?
It´s cold
Isn´t he cold
Rather dangerous
Too bad
He´s trying hard
It´s broken
Poor boy
He´s not good enough

She wants a 25% discount
25% ? Not so much
Come on
Here´s your pay
Buy me a drink

Y
I have three kids to feed
I can´t afford four
Shigeru
Free of charge
They came here before
I could give him a better price
At Akira´s shop they sell for 98,000 Yen
4200 Yen in all
Give me a discount
Wholesale price
Akira sells them cheaper
They buy from him
Not again
Come to the sea to coach us sometimes
I´m busy
No surfboards
No surfboards when crowded
Sit down,  young lady
They´re going to surf again
Looks like him
What´s the fun
What´s this for
Around your ankle
Ankle ?
I´m going
Stupid
Have some juice
98,000 Yen ?
I´ll ask him
Excuse me
Can we get that one with 10,000 Yen ?
It´s a 98,000 Yen surfboard
Chuck the jokes
9000 Yen
We can buy it
Trash
Y
Five grand
I got it
But it´s trash
Good for a start
Not a coin left
I´m broke
How´ll  we get home
Without bus fare ?
This is all ?
No one else ?
Kimura ?
Who knows ?
They´ll be late
As if i were a girl
Change positions
No
It´s crowded
Go there
Boring, without waves
Here he comes
He´s laughing
How´s business ?
.
Too high prices
Don´t blame us
The waves ?
The worst
How is he
He comes everyday
He´s geting much better
He´s trying hard
He needs a wet suit
He must be cold
Got guts
He sure has guts
He´s improving his skills
But it´s cold
Very cold
He´s naked
Cold ?
Very Cold
But it´s fun
Really ?
But you didn´t ride
Still it was fun
I´m tempted
Try
It´s just great
Really ?
It looks cold
Hi, use this

How was it
No good
The waves weren´t good at all
The white surfer was much better
Bad riding from the start

That was all I could do
There´s some time left
