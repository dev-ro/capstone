Oh, no.
'Cause I rented it

WeII, you are gonna get stuck

WeII, I don't think I shouId.
I think you guys shouId heIp.
No. You decIined

pay for that car.
No, we don't do that.
I returned it with a fuII tank of gas.
You returned it demoIished.
WeII, it's got a fuII tank of gas.
That's the Ieast of our worries

I've never seen anything Iike this before.
-What does that mean?
-No one's ever done that.
WeII, I can't pay for it.
-WeII, you're gonna have to.

Look, I'm gonna Iet

'cause I just wanna hoId it in.
-Gotta poo?

-Yeah. Like, reaIIy bad.
Don't... Do you want to ruin everything?
-I swear to God, it's...

Oh, get out, dude, get out!
No shit, get out of here!
Come on, man,

Get out of the fucking car!
Oh! What do I do?
-Did you shit?

HoIy shit!
I'm taking a cab back to the hoteI.
He just shat everywhere.
That's bad.
Look.
-What's wrong, man?
-I had to sit there whiIe he shat.
I need to go home right now.
-It's on my hand.
-Just Iet them see it.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm aImost done.
I hope you didn't take a shit in that,

That is disgusting, man.
What a fucking Froot Loop.
Want me to pIay it back?
Hey! What the fuck? What the...
Got him, dude. And there went his hair.
-Turn around. Let's see it.
-That was so much.
Oh, no!
-Yeah.
-Look at me.
-That's a good one.
-We're ready.
I'm Ehren McGhehey,
and this is the Mousetrap.
AII right! AII right! AII right!
Come on! Come on.
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough! That's enough!
I caIIed it! Hey! Time!
Dude.
This isn't gonna work.
It might.
What's gonna happen here?
I don't know,
but it's not what's going to be intended.
Raab's putting a fucking tampon on.
That's Iike
a Courtney Love-sized maxi pad.
Dudes, this is, Iike,
worse than a hanging.
I'm Raab himseIf
and I'm a compIete fucking idiot.
-Oh, that's funny.
-It didn't work.
Nope.
-We gotta get another one, man.
-Let's do it again.
Hey, I'm Raab himseIf,
and this is Bungee Wedgie.
Is that your shitty ass, dude?
Look at the bIoody, shitty underpants.
Didn't give me a wedgie. I went forward.
I can't beIieve it.
That is so funny.
AII right, we're here in the vaIIey today
to do our own IittIe riot-controI test.
This is George Hruska.
AII right, George, what do you do
and what are we doing here today?
WeII, I'm Vice President of Operations
with A.L.S. TechnoIogies.
We manufacture
Iess-IethaI ammunition.
We're one of the top
manufacturing companies
in the United States.
And we're going to shoot you
with one of our projectiIes.
It's caIIed the Pen-Prevent.
It's a 40-gram, taiI-stabiIized bag.
It'II be traveIing
about 250 feet per second.
-Is that IethaI?
-It's considered Iess IethaI.
So, this morning
I thought I was taking it in the chest
with the beanbag projectiIe,
but George and his company
said, ''No way.''
'Cause if it hits me in the heart,
I'm pretty much done with, so...
We want to take
every singIe precaution...
Right.
...necessary to heIp protect
your vitaI organs.
Where are my intestines?
Are they in that area?
-I think so.
-Awesome.
So are you gonna
take some practice shots?
Pressure.
-Jesus Christ.
-Yeah.
You know, this is nothing
to mess around with.
This is nothing for anybody
to just throw into a 12-gauge shotgun
and, you know, think
that they couId take it.
You know,
that's one of the reasons I'm doing this
is because I can do this
in a controIIed state.
Safety's off.
Going hot.
That reaIIy hurt.
That Iooked Iike it hurt.
Oh, fuck, dude.
Did you see the way
l caught that beanbag with my stomach?
That's instinct.
You can't teach that.
It hurts so much.
Like going from a prone position
to standing is...
Ouch.
Hi. I'm Wee Man, and this is a big cone.
Oh, my God, my brakes!
I can't...
My brakes!
My brakes!
My brakes!
Stop me! Stop me!
Stop me!
-You aII right?
-That was so fast!
-You aII right?
-Yeah.
-You have... Did your brakes go out?
-Yeah. The whoIe thing doesn't work.
ReaIIy?
WiII you push me to the top?
I wanna do it again.
I couId sure go for a MiIIer High Life.
Oh, you're in so much troubIe.

I'm about to get
the shit kicked out of me by a girI.
Dude, I toId you to keep up the Ieft!
HaiI to the queen!
-That's the winner.
-That's it.
And the winner,
and stiII champion...
Now pronounce her name.
Look at his bIoody mouthpiece.
Oh, God, my jaw is, Iike,
two inches to the Ieft.
l seriously felt all right for a little bit,
until she punched me in the nose.
l knew she was fighting dirty.
TropicaI PoIe-VauIting.
Oh, Jesus!
Go grab the dead kitty.
Dude, I've fucking
been in there before, dude. It sucks.
Oh, God!
Since we no Ionger

I promise
I wiII get my mom to say ''fuck''

HeIIo. I'm Johnny knoxviIIe,
and we're about to test
my rocket skates.
Go!
AII right, this is rocket skates,

This one's gonna be a IittIe more
powerfuI than the Iast one, so...
-Why, these are different bottIe rockets?
-No, there's just more of them.
-Oh, fuck!
-What's wrong?
I feII and busted my ass,
that's what's fucking wrong.
That's it.
No more rocket skates.
God, this party sucks!
Hey, my man. Wasabi, Iots.
Wasabi.

So today, I'm gonna treat myseIf

Pretty good.

I need a pick-me-up.
Dude, on the pIate. On the pIate.
-Oh, God, dude.

Oh, man.
That's a bump.
Look at that speciaI sauce.
-SwaIIow it.

Don't you even Iook?
Oh, my God! It's moving.
Oh, PhiI!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-I don't know what to do now.
-Aren't you scared to death?
It's so gross that it's even on the fIoor.

He's going, yeah.

Something Iike this.
''Oh, my face!''
I'm Johnny knoxviIIe
and I'm gonna grind this raiI.
Ready, set, go!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
He made it aII the way down.
l can't believe he got that far.
-You made it to the fucking bottom!
-l can't believe he got that far.
l can't believe... l can't...
This is the Paper Cuts.
I'm getting paper cuts
between the webbings of my fingers
and the webbings of my toes.
-HoId it stiII.
-There's no good way to do it.
Yeah, I know. So just deaI with it.
Take a... Take a breath.
Oh, you can feeI when it goes in.
Oh, give me... This one works good,
give me the next one.
Do it. Do it.
-Oh, yeah, opened up with a good one.
-Did you hear that?
-Oh, that was my fIesh!
-Oh, shit.
If I do your hand,
you'II forget about the pain in your foot.
That's a good point.
Take a deep breath.
Lance is trying... Are you gonna puke?
Don't, Lance,
there's so many pIaces for you to...
-Watch Lance pass out.
-Lance is gonna puke!
From what,
the pepperoni or the paper cuts?
Both?
The pepperoni.
It's good! With pig entraiIs.
-Is he okay?
-I don't know.
-Wait, is he aII right?
-Lance, are you aII right?
-Medic!
-Hey, don't knock over the beer.
-Dude, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-And get him in a coId room.
-This is the greatest bit ever.
Steve-O, if you want to do some more,
do it. I'm done.
Is everybody ready?
Yeah.
See the Iook on his face?
-Do one more.
-Do it again.
That sucked.
God, am I gIad I came down
to see what was going on in this room.
Wait a minute.
I know what my fortune is. It's partying.
This is Sweaty Fat Fucks.
Oh, honey, it's been a whiIe.
-It's a IittIe too much.
-No, I...
Irving, you think you can do it?
-Do you want a spot?
-No, I got it. No, I got it.
-You got it?
-Yeah, yeah.
-If you need a spot, just give me a caII.
-Okay.
What's the quickest
you ever knocked anyone out?
I hoId the CaIifornia state record.
It's Iike 18 seconds,
incIuding the 10 count.
I think you're gonna break that today.
-I'm Johnny knoxviIIe.
-And I'm Butterbean.
Today we're gonna do a IittIe boxing.
AII right, you guys.
Touch gIoves and come out fighting.
-Get up!
-Come on, Butter...
One more time.
This is the Iast time
you're kicking my ass.
One more time.
More pain. That's it.
You haven't even...
Hit me once, at Ieast.
There you go.
That's it.
Is there a probIem?
He's out.
Is Butterbean okay?
Look at this.
And by knockout in the first round,
new champion, Butterbean!
Yeah!
-Where we going, knoxviIIe?
-The hospitaI.
-What the heII are we doing that for?
-I don't know.
ApparentIy I have
a big gash in my head,
and I think I'm a IittIe concussed.
-Are you giving me a shot?
-Yeah.
Are you okay?
-We got one more to go, buddy.
-Yes, sir.
-Then you're a free man.
-Thank you.
You're gonna be not feeIing great
the next 24 hours.
-Thank you, Dr. kipper.
-Okay.
You'II probabIy see me
in two to three days.
See you in a coupIe of days.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
God damn it! What are you doing?
Hey! Get off, man!
-What's going on here?
-Get off!
Get off!
We're in Okinawa
and we're about to go swim
with some whaIe sharks.
But first, we need to go rub one out.
Well, l made the mistake
of showing them
what sea cucumbers do
when they're threatened.
And that is, you know,
as soon as something touches them,
these white threads
come out of the end of it,
and Steve-O and Chris
thought it was a great idea.
So, they're out there trying to...
-Masturbate?
-Masturbate. Yeah.
So, anyway, l apologize.
This is the WhaIe Shark Gummer.
With a simpIe shave of the razor,
Steve-O easiIy disguises himseIf
to fooI the whaIe sharks
into thinking he's a harmIess young boy.
I am pretty nervous about my wiener
around that whaIe shark. I reaIIy am.
Now, the best way
to think of the whaIe sharks
is they're Iike big puppy dogs.
Sometimes puppies bite.
Yeah, but they have IittIe teeth.
-Puppies, they have IittIe teeth.
-LittIe teeth.
-You're gonna get a gummer.
-AII right.
So, it's kind of Iike
being with a gaI with no teeth.
-kind of, yes.
-Yeah.
So right below in these waters,
30-foot whale sharks
are waiting to eat
these freaking shrimp
out of our crotches.
Okay.
Oh, they're kind of... They pinch.
Are these aIive?
-They don't feeI good on the way...
-You're part of this, man.
Look at this shrimp.
I guess I don't reaIIy have
any Iast words.
I'm just gonna kiII myseIf
once I Iose my wiener.
My penis is reaIIy smaII now.
I can't reaIIy Iook cooI right now.
Hi. I'm Johnny knoxviIIe.
This is the TidaI Wave.
-How'd it Iook?
-It Iooked good.

Now, you're getting crazy on this shit.
Ape!
He's starting to Iose it!
Jesus Christ!
Ape, I need toiIet paper!
Okay, this is caIIed
the GoIf Course Airhorn.
When peopIe tee off,
when they're coming down
with their swing,
we're gonna bIow these airhorns.
-Here she goes again.
-No. Is it another one?
She stiII hit it reaIIy good.
HoIy shit.
What'd I teII you? What'd I teII you?

Go!
HoIy fuck!
You aII right?
-You okay?
-I'm good. I'm good.
-What'd you think happened right there?
-It's embarrassing.
I was bareIy haIfway through the ceiIing,
and you were aIready out the door.
You were really sprinting.
ReaIIy, guys in masks, I'm out.
I don't pIay. I don't pIay.
Is there any actuaI, Iike, reaI reason
why anyone wouId shove
something up their ass Iike this?
-No.
-I'm cIaiming predictions for this event.
-Where's Ryan?
-Did you make them?
Number one, it's not getting in there.
Number two, even if it does,
it's not staying in there.
DefiniteIy no sitting down happening.
Number three, there's no way
they're gonna beIieve that this is true.
So, you're saying it's...
I'm saying there's nothing I want more
than for this to happen, but...
-You don't want it to happen that much.
-No, I reaIIy do.
This is our originaI taIent
for this piece, by the way.
-Yeah. I think that...
-It's one of the first things I think
I've ever seen you duck out on.
Oh, man, I am so gIad
I turned this idea down.
I'm so gIad.
I'II probabIy use aII of this
before the end of the segment.
What eIse we got?
A condom. Thank you.
And a IittIe toy car.
BIue, it's my favorite coIor.
Let me see that. DangIe it.
Look at the reservoir tip.
-Now I'm Iubing up...
-I can't see the car, Ryan.
...the IittIe toy car,
because I'm going to put it in my butt.
Be comfortabIe.
Hey, Ed's here for rescuing, dude.
You're here for making it a probIem.
AII right, you're gonna watch this?
-You're making me uncomfortabIe.
-Sorry.
I gotta get another job.
-Lube up your corn hoIe.
-I am. I'm spackIing.
''SpackIing.''
-Heart rate's going up for sure!
-Oh, dude, it hurts.
Your adrenaIine's fIowing, isn't it?
There's no getting around it,
it fucking hurts Iike heII.
Come on in, Manny.
You're just in time, Manny.
Oh, Manny. TeII me I'm a man.
-Hey, man, he's got it...
-It feeIs so goddamn gross.
This is totaIIy insane.
-I thinks it's breathing.
-WheeIs in?
It's in, dude.
-It's in?
-Yeah.
-Let's see.
-Oh, fuck!
I feeI Iike I have to shit my ass.
Is there anything in tap?
No, this don't happen in nature, dude.
This is insane.
''This doesn't happen in nature.''
You said that you didn't want to do it
because your dad wouId disown you?
WeII, I mean, it wasn't that.
You drank wine
off of a dude's ass crack.
My dad never saw that.
I never toId him that, you know.
I was gonna do this
and I was Iike, ''Dad...''
I was Iike,
''Dad, we're going hard these days,
''and there's some ideas
fIoating around.''
I just mentioned the car in the butt.
My dad, Iike... The onIy time in my Iife
I ever heard my dad, Iike...
You know,
it's Iike when your parents say,
''I'm not mad at you,
I'm just disappointed,'' you know.
Like, that hurts so much more,
you know?
Fucking rad.
Look at him waIk.
Dunn's gonna win, dude.
I'm not too excited about this skit.
It's not my favorite I've ever done,
because there's a toy car in my butt.
But this is the Butt X-ray.
I think I need an x-ray.
-Antoine?
-Yes?
-How you doing?
-Pretty good.
-I'm Ryan, and this is...
-What can I do for you?
I was partying Iast night
with some frat guys.
I passed out. I must've faIIen down
and broken something,
'cause I haven't been
abIe to waIk right since.
We're gonna take x-ray now, to be sure.
Okay.
-Take a...
-Oh, okay.
This is comfy.
HoId your breath. Don't move.
-What is that?
-I have no idea.
That's not part of you.
That's something extra.
I wouId've known if I ate that.
No. You wouIdn't be abIe
to swaIIow that.
That is a car toy.
-WeII, how did a car toy get there?
-Maybe you stuck it up your ass.
I didn't stick anything up my ass.
-Have you ever seen anything Iike that?
-No, I never seen that in there.
I've seen a toy car aII over,
but never in somebody's rectum.
-You can't get it out? You don't have...
-No.
I'm a physician,
but I practice this, x-ray, onIy.
You think maybe I can just,
you know, poop it out?
You won't be abIe to poop it out.
In fact, it wiII hurt you.
In fact,
I don't think it's even good for you
that you poop it out.
What wiII happen if you take Ex-Lax?
WiII that heIp?
No, if he takes Ex-Lax,
weII, he gets a Iot of diarrhea,
but no car.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me.
-Okay.
-Thanks again.
You know, it's not that easy
trying to get this thing out as it is.
EspeciaIIy with aII you guys
fucking staring at me.
Fucking peanut gaIIery
whiIe I'm trying to crap.
-Oh, shit!
-Get down there and fiIm Iow.
That sounded Iike an injury.
-Did it come out?
-It's coming.
Everyone, be quiet.
Oh, that hurt so bad.
-Let me see it. HoId it up.
-Something broke.
I'm bIeeding.
-Let's see it. Let's see it.
-Not that bad.
He's aIive!
Oh, Johnny knoxviIIe. He made it.
Oh, there is a God.
Oh, pIease.
And at Iast! I thought it wouId never...
This is the end!
Oh, thank you, Jesus!
Oh, chiId!
-Let's see it! Let's see it!
-Not that bad.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!
Bam, what the...
Whose dick do I gotta suck
to get some expIosions around here?
It's got a boner.
Oh! Oh, fuck!
That's a man.
Gator wrestIing.
For fuck's sake, come here!
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Hurry!
We wanted to see if you wouId run here
with a car up your ass.
No, I ain't running anywhere.
It's scary enough to waIk.
You're nice. You're a good man.
-Want to come over for dinner?
-No, that's okay.
-You know how to operate it now?
-Yeah, I think so. I think so.
-I need heIp.
-Yeah.
The smiIey face is a compIete cruciaI.
What did I say?
-Fuck.
-Fuck.
I didn't say the ''F'' word.
Yeah, you did. You said ''fuck.''
-Don't worry, we'II bIeep it.
-I did? Can we cut that out?
-It's aII right.
-It Iooks fine. It Iooks normaI.
I think it says ''fuck'' on my forehead.
-They don't have a taiI?
-No! They must have...
Show him the x-ray.
I mean, trust me, dude,
I'm not unimpressed.
Fuck!
The next time,
we can do Son of Jackass.
Son...
Yeah, dude.
