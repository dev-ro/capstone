When I was little,
every morning
I'd look out the window.
And I'd think...
every morning it changes.
BACK TO BURGUNDY
Yeah.
When I was a kid,
I thought every day was different.
And it would always be like that.
It would always keep changing.
But then I realized that, here,
nothing ever changes.
All my buddies left for college
in Dijon, Paris,
Montreal.
My father wanted me
to take over the domain.
I couldn't imagine living here.
We fought every day.
It became unbearable.
I had to take off.
I wanted to see the world.
And so...
it's 10 years later and...
I've seen the world.
Maybe it wasn't much use,
since here I am.
But I did see it.
Maybe the only thing I learned
is that you can never see it all.
Watch out!
Watch out, guys!
My sister called to say
my father was sick.
So here I am.
I left to get away from him.
And came back because of him.
Yes?
Jean?
Marcel.
Long time no see.
You know your way around.
Take my keys.
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Juliette!
- Hi, Marcel.
Is someone upstairs?
Yeah.
A little surprise!
Jean?
Juliette!
Fuck! It's you!
You've changed.
I've changed?
You have a beard.
Yeah.
What?
No way.
You could've called.
Know how long it's been?
Four years and 11 months.
What have you been up to?
They're still here.
I lived with someone,
a girl named Alicia.
I'm not sure we're still together.
It's complicated.
And you?
I sort of lived with someone.
But it's complicated, too.
Things are crazy.
He was hospitalized four months ago.
I went to see him yesterday.
Really?
At first, I went every day.
Now it's three or four times a week.
Jérémie and I take turns.
It's not easy.
Especially with the harvest coming.
I can imagine.
And you? Do you make wine?
- Yes?
- I've run a small domain for five years.
It's way bigger than here.
But for Australia, it's tiny.
Yeah.
And you, little sister?
I make wine.
I've been working with Dad for two years.
But now that he's not here,
I'm not sure if I'll stay or leave.
Jérémie!
Look who's here!
Hi.
So what have you been up to?
- Nothing special.
- Nothing?
He's married, has a baby.
You're married? You have a baby?
You have a baby?
- Yeah.
- Fuck!
A 3-month-old baby boy.
That's excellent!
If you had called, you'd know.
Incidentally,
I don't know if you know...
Mom died.
Five years ago.
You may recall,
I called to let you know,
but Mr. Big-shot was too busy,
off in Australia.
He didn't decide to come.
Or even respond.
- What's that about?
- Jérémie...
Jérémie, what?
Really? He just pops up
and we're supposed to...
We've been taking care of Dad,
the domain, everything! And he...
What do you know about my life?
I don't know shit!
I don't know where you live,
who you live with, what you do?
Since Mom died, zilch!
It was bad timing, okay!
Bad timing?
We buried Mom!
You weren't even here.
Jérémie, stop.
Fuck, I didn't wanna lose it.
Hey, kiddies!
Having a big reunion?
Am I interrupting?
Could you give me a hand?
Sure.
Straight ahead, just like that.
Keep going.
Watch out for the faucet.
Watch the vat.
Don't feel obligated.
I'm not.
A little further. Straight ahead!
Nice and easy.
I work at my wife's
family's vineyard, too.
They're piling on the pressure, so I'm...
sort of on edge. I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Pull it this way.
Come on.
That's good.
Careful!
There's not much time
before the harvest
and the winery's not ready.
When do you start? Do you know?
We're supposed to decide today.
Who decides?
Juliette.
Yeah, it's me but...
If you want to, you can.
Monday?
In eight days?
Yeah, in eight days.
Jean, don't laugh. It's not funny.
- In eight days?
- Yeah.
Taste the sunny side.
I'd say Thursday.
Thursday? In four days?
In four days, yeah.
If you start in eight days,
you'll be too late for the reds.
And it'll be too sweet by the end.
They taste good already.
- Don't they?
- But the skin's tough.
- And?
- Shouldn't it be thinner?
And juicier.
The seeds are barely brown.
I'd wait till they're fleshy.
So you wanna make an easy wine?
Like Dad's.
Don't you want a taut, acidic wine?
- Yeah.
- Well, then?
Why not wait for the lab results?
By three o'clock,
we'll know what we're talking about.
Taste it again.
Taste 'em on the hill.
There's a big difference.
- Thursday's too soon.
- No, it's not.
Taste that.
- What is it?
- Can we say?
Can we say?
Mango.
Definitely Thursday.
I thought they'd be sour up here.
What do you think, Marcel?
Your dad always said,
"With whites,
on time is already too late."
So?
Your dad wouldn't start till Saturday.
But Jean's right, it depends on
what kind of wine you wanna make.
Let's check the weather
and moon cycle.
If we wait too long,
it may rain during the harvest.
Thursday?
Yeah, Thursday...
But let's check the weather.
Yeah.
He saw Dad before he got home?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Was that your girlfriend?
Yeah, it was Alicia.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
So?
1999?
Not bad. Almost.
Just three years off.
2002?
1996.
1996, shit. Of course.
A premier cru?
- Yes. A 1996 Cailleret.
- Meursault.
You never see that kind of energy
in a '99 or a 2002.
Next Sunday,
I'm taking it up a notch.
We'll do blind tastings more often.
You've got some huge gaps.
Stop, Anselme. Take it easy.
It's olfactory memory.
He just needs practice.
I know... It's just that...
we tasted others before...
I'm stunned. Didn't your father
do blind tastings like this?
Okay, honey, he got it.
If he's not educated,
he'll never go anywhere.
- You can't make wine without...
- I know.
Winemaking is hard work.
Now let's taste the '85.
You'll see, it's an exceptional year.
Jérémie, you just dip your finger in.
What do we start with?
- The odor?
- No, the color.
Right, the color.
Jérémie?
It's white?
Yes, it's white wine.
That's my son.
It smells like the barn.
Yes, exactly. It smells like hay.
Now taste it.
What fruit do you think of?
- Lemon?
- Very good, Juliette.
It's a little too acidic.
But behind the lemon,
isn't there another fruit?
Pear?
No, Jean.
Go on, think.
- That thing at the Chinese restaurant?
- Right...
- Litchi?
- Exactly.
Yes, good.
- They're good.
- Very gifted.
You're all gonna be good.
Jean.
Jean, wake up.
Jean.
What's going on?
He's...
We all treasured his presence.
Now we must accustom ourselves
to his absence.
I didn't come to Mom's funeral
because my son was born the day she died.
The day you called to tell me.
Why didn't you say so?
I was at the maternity hospital
with Alicia.
She'd just given birth.
I got your message but, I don't know...
I figured I couldn't just leave her.
So I stayed with them.
You should've told us.
Think it was easy?
Why didn't you tell us later?
I called three days later,
I left messages. You never called back.
I was really pissed
that you hadn't called me back.
I didn't understand either.
So how old is your son?
Four years and 11 months.
Say what you want,
Dad made good wine.
It's opened up now.
Even better than last time.
When'd you taste the 1990 Pommard?
At Christmas, five years ago.
And you remember?
Sure.
How do you do it?
Let's try Grandpa.
Thanks.
Grandpa was more romantic,
more idealistic.
There's also the Corvées,
4.5 acres of Aligoté,
but that's not worth much.
However, you have three premiers crus:
.46 acres of Perrières,
.66 acres of Rugiens
and .88 acres of Sous le Dos d'Ane.
Of your 17 parcels,
three are premiers crus,
five are Village.
The rest are regional reds and whites
over four municipalities.
And the house, of course.
All in joint ownership.
Sorry. "Joint ownership"?
The conjunction of various
identical rights on a given property.
If one of the joint owners
decides to sell his share,
the others, who cannot oppose it,
have the right of first refusal
on the share sold.
That means that you three
are co-owners of the property.
It can't be divided.
If one of you makes a decision,
he can't do it unless you all agree.
For example,
if one of you wants to sell,
he can't do so without a consensus.
But first things first.
Because your first priority
is to pay the inheritance tax.
And about how much will that be?
In the neighborhood of €500,000.
- 500,000?
- Yes.
Can you pay that?
Do you have any savings?
In that case, you have three options.
One, to sell off your wine stock.
Everything in your cellar.
I doubt that would be enough.
The second possibility,
to sell off a few parcels.
Or you could just sell the house.
Do we have an estimate
of what their stock is worth?
Approximately €300,000.
As I feared, that's not enough.
What if we sold the entire domain?
That would simplify things enormously,
if you three
were to sell the entire domain.
Property values in Burgundy
are exploding these days.
The profitability of a vineyard
like yours is 1% of its property value.
That means
the money you earn making wine
is 1% of the money you could earn
by selling your land.
And what's the market value?
Roughly, I'd say
a little over €6 million.
Oh, yes.
Might that be a possibility
for you, too?
Afterward, no one said a word.
When you lose someone,
you think something remains.
And that you'll gain something.
Like an inheritance.
But not us.
In addition to losing our father,
we had a lot more to lose.
Some of you are old hands.
If you're new, listen up.
Don't go down the rows yourself.
Wait for us to place you.
Always cut to your left.
Never to the right.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
This is sort of important.
Always cut to your left.
Next...
Don't cut the burnt ends.
Don't touch those.
And don't cut the verjus.
What's the verjus?
It's anything that grows on top.
These teeny grapes.
Don't cut them.
They're not ripe yet.
If you have any questions,
ask a crew chief:
Marcel,
Didier,
Vincent and Jean-Michel.
Otherwise...
this year's sort of unusual
for us because...
the three of us just lost our dad.
So...
Anyway,
we'll try to do our best.
And everything will go well.
I just want to wish you all
a good harvest.
Everyone grab a bucket
and pruning shears.
Vincent, you position them.
Wait.
Don't cut the stem.
Pull off the leaves, so you can see.
And cut where it's green.
Go ahead.
- Did you taste them?
- No.
Taste one.
Good, huh?
Don't eat 'em all.
See you later.
Hey, carrier.
- Carrier.
- Coming.
Coming, I said.
I can't be everywhere.
- Let's go.
- Everybody.
Go.
They're good.
But they have to be watched.
Yeah, right.
- Lights out.
- Gimme a break.
Let's go.
Excuse me. What's your name?
- Lina.
- Lina.
Why?
Just so I know.
Your sister doing okay without your dad?
Yeah, I think so.
What do I test for?
Just sugar, At and pH?
Yeah, sugar, At and pH.
So?
The Basses Gouttes
went up 13° in two days.
Let's start with them.
Then the Charrons.
- Yeah, I agree.
- They went up fast.
Leave the carriers,
we're using bins today.
Let's go!
Move, you slackers!
- Charlene.
- What?
Take off your t-shirt.
To motivate us.
You'd like that.
Can you help me, honey?
Keep cutting, girls.
Maybe I'll cut yours off.
Fanny's hot.
My name's Marouane, it's already cut.
- Didn't you know?
- Shut up. Don't start.
It turns me on.
That's for "shut up."
Marouane, stop.
That's for not coming to my room.
Charlene, take off your t-shirt.
Food fight.
Hey, girls, it's war.
Not my hair.
Fuck.
Stop.
Do you hear me?
Stop throwing grapes.
Stop. Stop.
- I saw you.
- You stop.
- What's your name?
- Marouane.
That's irresponsible.
I think Fanny loves me.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Chill out.
Don't be a pain in the ass.
A pain in the ass?
Sorry, but you're an employee here.
I'm not paying you
to throw grapes around.
Sorry, master.
You boss, me slave.
You wanna beat me?
Go on, beat me.
If you don't like it here, you can go.
You're flipping out over a few grapes?
That wasn't just a few grapes.
- 50, 100. Who cares?
- Marouane, stop.
For the past week,
we've been working like dogs for you.
I've been lugging crates for six days.
- That's no reason.
- So?
For 15 grapes,
you're busting my balls?
What do they cost, tell me?
€10, €20?
No, tell me. This is your place,
you must know the price.
- Here's a 20, is that enough?
- Don't bother.
Pick it up.
You and your pathetic
bourgeois problems.
What's the matter?
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
What do you mean?
I don't feel like a boss.
- You like wine?
- Sure.
You like wine, you make wine.
- That's dumb.
- Yep.
Come on.
You're dumb.
Hold on.
What are Gérard's guys doing?
That's our row.
They're picking our grapes.
Shit.
Stop.
That's our row. Stop.
What's going on?
The same as every year.
Your guys are picking in our row.
Oh, yeah. They are.
- You two.
- Us?
That's not ours. Stop here.
Go on.
Stop here.
- No big deal.
- The bucket.
Give me that bucket.
Every year. That asshole.
- What did you say?
- "That asshole."
Isn't that what you said?
"That asshole"?
Yeah, that was it.
She said,
"That asshole."
Take off.
- What?
- You asshole.
She's nuts.
You wanna go back to Australia?
Yeah, I think so.
Honestly, I don't even know.
Doesn't all this make you wanna stay?
Yeah, but...
I don't know about you,
but I can't see myself living here.
How so? What do you mean?
What do I mean?
You wanna sell
your share of the inheritance?
- My share of the inheritance?
- Yeah.
"The old miller
left his mill to the eldest,
and his shares to the youngest."
I'm asking you a question.
Was that your plan all along?
To sell the domain?
Hi, son. How are you?
I don't believe this.
He tosses that out, then takes off.
Yes, I'll be home soon.
Hold the wheel straight.
Look straight ahead.
Watch the road.
One,
two, three.
You're on your own.
You sure you wanna destem 50/50?
That's what we said.
Your father wouldn't reach
for the moon with these grapes.
He'd do maybe 70/30, but no more.
Dad's not here. It's up to you.
We'll do what we said.
Okay, General.
Stop the destemming machine.
Juliette!
Look at this.
What?
What does that mean?
Is that rain?
Is it moving toward us?
No, it's not gonna rain.
The cloud's moving toward Châlon.
- Let's ask Didier.
- Didier!
- Yeah?
- Come here!
- But...
- What's up?
- Will it rain or not?
- No, I don't think so.
That cloud will either move
toward the Saône
or over the mountains.
- No chance of rain.
- Just like I said.
Okay, let's go.
You can sing at the party tonight.
We're almost done.
- Marouane.
- Coming!
Hello, sweetheart.
I know it's been a long time.
My dad died,
so I have to stay a bit longer.
I miss you, too, Ben.
Yeah, I know.
Don't cry, Ben.
Ben. Ben.
I'm taking off.
The festivities begin.
What's going on?
You okay, Juliette?
Not you, too? What is this?
Did you plan this together?
Everyone's coming.
No crying allowed tonight.
I'll give you a hand.
Come on, Juliette.
I'm supposed to be
at my in-laws' party but...
Wine! Wine! Wine!
And when we run out, we've got more!
Watch your back.
It's hot.
Juliette. Jean. I have to go.
I have to stop by Océane's party.
Jérémie.
- Taste this.
- I'm on my way out.
- Not without tasting this.
- No, no.
1995 Perrières.
- '95?
- Let's taste it.
Okay, just a drop.
Is that the '95 Perrières?
Just a sip, then I'm off.
Thanks.
Really good.
Faster!
One more time!
How long did you stay?
Two years.
I worked at a Mendoza vineyard.
Then I went to Chile.
Then I moved to Australia.
That's great.
I mean bumming around like that.
I'd love to.
But I don't have the courage.
- I'm not sure it takes courage.
- Sure it does.
To leave your friends,
country, language.
I think I was running away.
From what?
Pinot.
I wanted to get away
from it, from all this.
My roots.
- But you came back.
- Yeah.
And why do you wanna leave?
I'm from Brittany, from Finistère.
- Know what Finistère means?
- No.
"The ends of the earth."
I've always felt like
I was far from everything.
So I've always had wanderlust.
- I'd never even been to Burgundy.
- How exotic.
Exactly.
Hello? Yes.
- I'm taking off.
- Go.
- How's it going with...
- Hold on a second.
Okay, I see.
What are you talking about?
No, I don't know
what it's like to escape.
Juliette.
Excuse me, can I...
Excuse me.
Can we talk for two minutes, please?
I'm fine.
I am calm.
Wait. Just five minutes...
One more! One more! One more!
You okay?
No, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna turn in.
No, you're not. Stay with me.
Come on.
Come on.
- Have a drink.
- I'm not in the mood.
Come on, have a drink with me.
Things are heating up.
She's dropping her consonants.
Remember that?
What?
What are you talkin' about?
What are you sayin' about me?
What?
I said you're dropping your consonants.
- No.
- Yes, you are.
Why, Jérémie...
Why do you need consonants?
Why?
Why do you need consonants?
You've got a point there.
- You know what?
- What?
Tonight, let's screw consonants.
- Screw consonants!
- Fuck 'em.
Fuck consonants.
Drop a few consonants yourself.
- No.
- Just a few.
- You're such a good dancer.
- Thanks.
Really...
What's he saying?
"What a concert."
"Did you come out to cool off?"
"Obviously, Marouane."
"I'll lean against these cool stones."
"Yes, I'm sorry."
- He's apologizing.
- For his blunder.
- "I love..."
- "Green beans."
"I love all kinds of cheese."
"Dry."
"What's happening?
I need some space."
"Marouane, you're a magician."
"Let me lean against the stones now."
"I'm so sorry."
"I'm losing all control."
"Listen to me, Juliette."
"Good God. Look at that sky."
"That starry sky?
It's filled with stars."
"You're among the stars, Juliette."
"Look at me. I'm but a pebble."
"A measly earthworm."
"A maggot."
What's he doing?
Take it easy.
So...
how about a drink?
Océane...
Thanks for stopping by.
- I'm sorry. What'd I do?
- Screwed up.
- I fucked up.
- Big time.
- I'm sorry.
- You could have called.
You don't understand.
The only reason I stayed
was for my brother and sister.
Yeah, right.
Being in mourning...
It's not easy, okay?
And I think...
I think...
Sorry. With my brother and sister...
I feel sort of guilty.
And I'm having a hard time...
Really, a hard time...
They were really hurting tonight.
So I thought...
So I stayed.
But I'm still having a hard time...
finding where I belong.
No big deal. Listen...
You don't believe me, but it's true.
It's true. They're really in pain.
- I swear.
- They don't look so bad.
I swear, they were.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.
It smells great.
Now, which one?
- The Rugiens?
- Yeah.
Okay, here I come.
I know you don't agree, but...
Wouldn't we be better off
selling the whole domain?
We're talking six million bucks.
Does it leave you...
completely cold to sell
the place where we grew up?
The land, the wine,
everything Mom and Dad worked for?
- You don't give a shit.
- I do.
But I haven't lived here
for 10 years.
My life is elsewhere, that's all.
It's hard to explain.
I'm in debt. I need money.
- In debt to whom?
- The bank.
Anyway, it's my life.
It's none of your business.
Yes, it is, Jean.
You're talking about my life, too.
Your decision has
pretty big consequences on my life.
You live in peace, far from us all.
But today your business is my business.
So you'd better explain.
I don't see why I should change my life
without understanding why.
I agree.
And I remind you, we're joint owners.
I've been living with Alicia
for six years.
We met in Brazil.
Then we spent time in Argentina,
and kept traveling.
Then we moved to Australia
and bought a domain.
So?
To buy the domain,
you need a mortgage, don't you?
So I pay 1,000 bucks a month.
Before, I kept up the payments.
But now I'm not even there.
I have no income, no check, nothing.
No place to live. No country.
That's my life.
When do you plan to go back?
I don't know.
I should be there by now, but...
Alicia doesn't wanna see me, so...
And your son?
- You sure she doesn't wanna see you?
- I have no idea! Okay?
Selling one parcel of Village
and all the Aligotés would be enough.
Or sell four rows of Perrières
or the Rugiens and keep the rest.
No way are we selling those.
Or sell the two premiers crus
and keep all the rest.
We need the premiers crus.
I'm not gonna be the queen of Aligoté.
- We're trying to find a solution!
- There is none!
You gonna go?
No, you go.
Voilà.
That was our inheritance.
None of us would get any money.
Yet now we all had
rich people's problems.
The living room
is used for wine tastings.
- How big is it?
- Hello.
- Are we intruding?
- Oh, hello.
I should've called.
Not at all.
The living room leads directly...
into the kitchen.
Hello.
Are we intruding?
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me.
The tours were nonstop
but nobody wanted just the house.
They mostly wanted
the vineyards surrounding it.
Hi, Jérémie.
Going okay?
- Can I help you?
- Please.
Hi.
The Americans seem to love it.
- Really?
- Great.
You think that's great?
Yeah.
- Then why the fuck do this?
- Because now's the time.
Biodynamic agriculture's a drag
if we're just gonna sell it in two weeks.
- The vines don't care who owns them.
- Yeah, right.
Marcel, if we had to sell it all?
The domain, I mean.
What would you do?
Why? Is that in the air?
I don't think so but...
I mean...
If it were?
You know, I don't check the weather
more than three days in advance.
Hand me the test tube.
Hi, Juliette. How's it going?
By the way...
Could we maybe get together?
For...
Just to...
sort of talk.
About everything and nothing.
I know what you wanna talk about.
And I'm not interested.
Nothing's for sale.
And especially not to you.
Okay.
Bye then.
Bye.
I'd forgotten winter in France.
I'd forgotten how it never ends.
Working the land, tending it,
you begin to feel it belongs to you.
It's not about papers
or family or deeds.
Oddly, when you begin
to feel it belongs to you,
you also see that you belong to it.
So it's already been five months.
Long-distance calls are horrible.
All I wanted was to hold her in my arms.
And yet, all I did was criticize her.
I just needed her to say
she needed me.
Are there four seasons in Australia?
Of course.
But they're not as distinct.
More like California.
It's the southern hemisphere,
so they're reversed.
Weren't you going back this month?
- Yeah, but I'm staying.
- Really?
Things aren't too clear.
I don't know what she wants.
She says she needs more time.
Yeah.
And your son?
It's hard.
I think about him all the time.
The creepy-crawler
crawls up and up and up...
and goes coochy-coochy-coo.
That's not bad.
But add some walls.
Or we'll freeze our butts off.
A roof, too.
That'd be nice in winter.
Could you...
- You're distracting me.
- Okay.
Dinner's ready!
Let me finish one thing!
- It's eight o'clock already?
- Yeah.
Ben. It's Daddy.
I know it's early there.
I wanted to catch you before school.
Everything's fine.
Let's speak French.
I'm speaking French.
What've you been up to?
You learned a song?
Hey, kids!
Kids!
Océane!
Fuck. It's Mom.
Yeah, Mom.
It's Sunday!
It's nine o'clock!
Exactly. And breakfast's ready.
- Come to the table.
- Okay.
I don't believe this.
I made crêpes.
I'm not going.
- Say I'm sick. Whatever you want.
- Okay.
Every fucking day! I can't take it!
Wanna go to Daddy?
It's okay.
- Can you take him for a minute?
- Come here.
Tell them Sunday's for sleeping.
Everything's okay.
Julien.
Thanks, Jérémie.
- You do the chitchat.
- Sure.
- I called you three times!
- We're coming!
Why didn't you answer me?
It's getting cold.
- Want help?
- No, I'm okay.
- Miss Vermillard!
- No.
Room service.
Anybody home?
There she is.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.
I'll put that here.
Only a brother does this for 20 years.
A lover, just the first week.
No way. I'd never do this for my chick.
How humiliating.
One last espresso.
- No, thanks.
- I insist.
It's Costa Rican Tarrazu.
Thanks.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
As you know, Océane's already begun
to rethink the layout and decoration
of the Célestins Mill.
That project
is very close to our hearts.
- I know.
- So...
For several months, I've watched you
tasting wine, making decisions.
I've let you oversee
two or three of the domain's wines.
But...
open your eyes.
You're not cut out for this.
I... What do you mean?
But we tasted those wines together.
Remember?
I remember, you said...
you were pretty happy with what I...
I've thought it over.
You can manage
that magnificent old mill,
which will house a restaurant,
a tasting room,
a hotel and a spa.
It's a very comprehensive project.
And I'm convinced
you're going to love it.
Really...
I'll think about it.
I know the difficulties
you and your siblings have.
Chantal has persuaded me
to come to your aid
by buying a few parcels
of your parents' domain.
You are trying to sell some, right?
Exactly, we...
That way, everyone makes out.
They'll become
part of my Pousse d'Or vineyard.
And for you, it stays in the family.
It fermented really fast.
Like all the reds this year.
Thanks.
Thanks.
- It's closed.
- That's normal.
Give it time.
You can already tell
you made the right choices.
Going 50/50 has given it structure.
The fruit's not floating around.
You can taste that?
Absolutely.
- It's good.
- I agree.
It's steady. I'll go get the Pommard.
We three have to talk.
The lawyer keeps calling.
We have to pay the taxes,
settle up with you.
Anselme has offered to buy some parcels.
Instead of selling
the house, we can do that.
And it stays in the family.
Whose family?
Our family.
Right, our family.
Do you prefer that?
No, I'd prefer almost anything else.
Obviously.
Jean, remember this?
You wrote out
all of Dad's classmates' names.
- Me?
- Yeah, that's your handwriting.
How do you remember that stuff?
I wrote all that?
Yeah. Don't you remember?
You were the same age
as Dad in the photo.
And you asked him to name
all his classmates.
You can toss it.
Are you serious?
We can't throw that away.
That's Dad's childhood.
And a nice souvenir.
Forget it. Jean's on
his scorch-and-burn-the-past trip.
Can I see that?
Thanks.
He wore this all the time.
Not bad, is it?
Can I climb the tree?
No, Jérémie, you're too small.
Come on.
Go, Jérémie.
I told you to watch your brother.
How dumb can you be?
Don't give me that look!
You're totally irresponsible!
It's not my job to watch them.
Don't talk back.
Aren't you the oldest?
Don't yell at him.
He's big but he's still a child.
You okay, Jérémie?
Don't worry.
Come on. Family hug.
A 100-year-old vine is rare.
My grandfather planted that one.
It was 85 years old
and it was spent.
Juliette tried to convince Dad
to tear it out.
But she never could.
We need time to think.
I'd rather sell off
the stock and the Aligoté.
We already discussed that.
It's not enough. Let's move on.
- I don't know.
- It's enough with Anselme's offer.
Stop.
You said you didn't want to.
I don't.
But if that's the only way...
What would Dad do?
- Stop, Juliette.
- What?
Why do you talk about Dad all the time?
Why do you bark every time we do?
- Bark?
- What's your problem with Dad?
- What did he do to you?
- You're funny.
Obviously, it was a lot easier for you.
I was the oldest,
I got hit with everything.
He'd tell me what you had to do.
And if you didn't do it,
I'd get balled out.
I couldn't say a word.
So I left.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I wrote to him a letter.
He never wrote back.
He never gave a damn about me.
- Jean.
- What?
I hesitated to tell you...
He didn't mail it...
but I found this in his jacket.
He did give a damn about you.
He can't speak
but you can speak to him.
Can he hear?
We're not sure
but we think he can.
Dad.
So, now you can't talk anymore?
That must be a change.
You sure loved to pontificate.
Not listen to anyone.
Why didn't you ever answer my letter?
"My son...
"No matter where you are,
you'll always be my son.
"How can I answer all your questions?
"I never understood why you left.
Reading your letter,
I see you blame me for lots of things."
You never gave a damn about me.
"Yet remembering the things we did,
"the time we spent in the vineyard,
"I was always proud of you.
"But it's true, I never told you.
And I should have.
Neither of us is very talkative."
Know what I thought?
"You can criticize me but...
There."
"Good thing he never answered."
"That's how it is.
"You were always more intelligent
than me, more gifted with words.
"Now you're gone and I realize
everything I should have said.
When you come home, we'll talk.
We'll have lots of time."
I came here to see you...
so we could talk.
Finally.
Man to man, you know.
Dad.
Are you okay?
Dad.
Dad...
"Make the most of your trip.
"I hope you meet lots of people,
learn lots of things.
"Things I couldn't teach you.
"See the world.
You've always wanted to.
"But then I hope you'll come home.
"I hope so because,
"even though you're mad at me,
"I love you.
And I'll always love you."
Alicia?
Do you speak French?
Juliette didn't want to sell the house.
We still couldn't pay the taxes on it.
But it needed a facelift.
- Should we lose this thing?
- Yeah.
- Push.
- I am.
What did he say?
He's only interested
in the premier crus.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What did you say?
I said someone had to run the spa.
And?
It doesn't interest him.
Really? It doesn't interest him?
Here we are.
Pass me your plates?
Somebody has to run the damn spa.
Daddy, Jérémie's 24.
I'm 24.
After all, we are...
You are what?
Adults. We're not kids anymore.
They're right, Anselme.
They're not kids anymore.
Kids.
Océane.
It's Mommy.
What are you doing here?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Alicia.
Ben, my son.
Hi, big guy.
Ben, come here.
Can you help me?
Can you hook this up there?
Where's she gonna sleep?
No idea.
You gonna sleep together?
Come here. Let Mommy sleep.
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.
Want me to take Ben to the pool?
- Where?
- The pool in Beaune.
Okay.
Are we together
or are we not together?
I don't know.
Making wine here, in Burgundy,
is nothing like back home, in Australia.
"Back home"?
They're two different
pleasures, my love.
- My love.
- My love.
Maybe I did say that.
But after all these months apart,
I've changed my mind.
Love is like wine.
It needs time.
It has to ferment.
And time doesn't just decay.
Are we together
or are we not together?
Here we are.
I think I'm in love.
Was it fun?
Did you destem a lot?
No, I did 50/50.
It's good. We were timid this year.
We destemmed a lot,
over 70%.
So our wines are simpler.
We should have done like you.
Juliette,
I won't beat around the bush.
I'm a man who seizes opportunity.
If I indeed offered
to buy those two parcels,
yet you continued to oversee them
and the vinification,
might that be conceivable for you?
For all three of you?
And she can make
the wine she wants?
Of course, that's the idea.
But I'd be your employee?
I'd own the land,
but it would be your wine.
You'd be his employee.
It wouldn't be
Domain Vermillard wine anymore.
Look,
think it over.
But that seems like
a good compromise for us all.
I'll do it.
You'd better be sure
you're able to work with my father.
Anselme can be cool.
Dad? Cool?
- I wouldn't say "cool".
- I mean...
They'll be able to get along together.
I'm not too sure of that.
One thing's for sure,
he'll never stop telling you what to do.
That's how he is. That won't change.
- Clos 2012?
- Gladly.
That was a tough year.
All this la-di-da doesn't make
their wine any better than ours.
"You know,
"little lady, this is where
I beat around the bush.
"And when I beat one,
"I seize it.
"Over there, I'm gonna build an airport
between those two trees.
"There, I'm putting in a pool
and a trampoline.
And I'm moving the hill behind you
next to the spa."
Thank you.
What a little barbecue.
I was showing Juliette our parcels.
Great, huh.
That's the 2009 Bouchères.
It's held up well, no?
- May I?
- Of course.
Great. I may.
It lacks a bit of acidity in the attack.
However, the finish...
is a tad too much.
There's fruit.
Fuck. A ton of fruit.
Maybe a bit too much fruit.
Let's dump in some cherries,
black currants,
litchi, Cantonese rice.
It's fruit city. They're everywhere.
Bursting on the taste buds.
And maybe a bit too much alcohol.
I think your brother's a bit tipsy.
Why? Because your wine's so clean?
It doesn't get people drunk?
It's too clean.
You still haven't responded
to my offer.
No, we're not selling.
What do you mean?
Do you all agree?
I thought he was the one
who wanted to sell?
Yes. But not to you.
We're out of the 2009, sir.
Could you bring up more bottles?
Come to the wine cellar with me.
Jérémie, you coming?
What's with your brother?
Is he mad at me?
I don't think so.
Yes. He's got a problem.
That's my brother.
That's how Jean is.
Didn't anybody teach him
to spit at a tasting?
He's acting like a child.
It's unbelievable.
I don't spit, either.
We don't spit in our family.
Our grandfather taught us that.
He said only wimps spit.
We like to drink.
Do you have something to say?
No. No.
Yes.
Even...
Yes, absolutely.
This isn't working, Anselme.
You can see how you are with me...
Yes, you know.
And what's that spitting business?
What is that?
If we don't wanna spit.
That's all.
Wanna know what I really think?
Yes, of course.
It's like that spa of yours.
The spa.
If we don't want...
If I don't want to...
It's the same with Jean.
If he doesn't want...
He does what he wants.
We're not here to...
It's always the same with you.
Stop thinking...
Stop thinking that
whatever you think, mister,
is what we...
That everybody's gonna...
Things don't work like that.
Like your fucking Tarrazu!
I don't like Tarrazu!
I mean,
we just don't have the same taste.
I've wanted
to tell you that for a while.
You okay?
Yeah. Fine.
I talked to your father.
And?
And...
We talked. I think he got it.
Did you say we wanted to move?
Yeah. No, I didn't say...
But I think he got that anyway.
Okay. Cool.
Yeah, cool.
Ben. Grab your jacket,
we're going out.
Come on.
Because I want you to speak French, too.
Try this. Repeat after me.
I live in Australia.
I live in Australia.
I live in Australia.
And my daddy's French.
And my daddy's French.
He's stubborn as a mule.
Let's go.
You little munchkin.
On your marks.
Get set. Go.
- Ben!
- Ben!
Yes?
- Wait for us, okay?
- Okay.
Puligny, Chassagnes.
One behind the other.
That's Meursault.
See the village?
Behind it, Volnay and Pommard.
Here in Meursault,
we have Gruyaches, in front of that tree,
and Perrières, up there.
The Perrières.
The Gruyaches.
Where's Ben?
Where are your parents?
Ben.
You okay?
Are you insane?
You're irresponsible.
There's a child here.
You're the one who brought him here.
We're in a vineyard.
Walking in nature.
You're the one spraying that shit.
- Oh, it's you.
- It's not shit.
No?
- It's not shit?
- No.
Then take off that suit.
- Take it off.
- Quit fucking around.
I'm interested.
Why can't you take off your suit?
I'm spraying Cymoxanil
to prevent mildew.
Exactly what your father used.
So spare me the song and dance.
And where's my father now?
Stop being such an idiot.
You know it's gonna
be crawling with mildew.
If you'd rather spray
your faggy nettle tea, go ahead.
But leave me alone.
I don't even wanna talk to you.
But you're on our land now.
So tell him to stop spraying
that shit on our vines, okay?
We're organic here.
Put what you want
on your vines, but not on mine.
Is that clear?
Eric.
- Want some wine, Juliette?
- Yeah.
Will you watch Julien?
Okay.
Is that mine?
Thanks.
Be careful, Ben.
Yeah.
Your son'll be walking soon.
You see that?
I hope I won't be a father
like Océane's father.
I hope I won't be a father
like your father.
Like your father.
Mine was great.
Ben, please be careful.
Come on.
Bedtime.
You look bushed.
You're not tired?
Okay, stop reading. Come on.
Go to sleep now.
Good night, son.
She's your girl?
Yeah.
She's beautiful.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do now?
Well,
your brother and sister and I
are meeting with the lawyer
to sell part of the domain.
You're gonna sell the domain?
Part of it.
Why?
To share it.
If I'm not here with them,
they owe me something.
What do they owe you?
A year later, nothing had changed.
But I'd changed.
I'd come home to see my father
and rediscovered my sister, brother,
my family, my home.
But after a year,
I realized that my home
was also across the globe.
It's wild. This is your first vintage.
Yeah.
- I'd start decanting.
- Let's bottle it.
No.
I don't wanna start decanting.
I don't wanna bottle yet.
Why?
You sure?
Yes. It's my wine.
I know what I'm doing.
I don't need 12 guys
telling me what to do.
You're staring at me
with your big balls.
I have my own ideas, my own taste.
Can't I have
a little fucking finesse and elegance?
- What?
- Nothing.
Once I decide,
I don't like to be contradicted.
- Anyway, it's gonna be good.
- Yeah.
It really is your wine.
It's peaceful, like you.
But it has
a strong side, too.
With a certain fragility.
- Complex.
- It's Juliette.
Tuesday?
Yeah.
I went to see the lawyer alone.
I'm going back to Australia.
I've thought it over.
We're not selling.
I don't wanna break up the family domain.
We'll work something out.
Between us.
As siblings.
I think that's what
Mom and Dad would want.
But you have to help me. At first.
Yeah.
I spoke to Alicia.
It was her idea.
Instead of selling off my share,
I'll rent you my parcels.
You can pay me something
that won't kill you.
That way, we still own it together.
Even if I'm not here physically.
Does that work for you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
We'll sell off part of our stock
in Australia to pay the taxes.
Welcome to you all.
Thanks for coming.
- Hello.
- Welcome.
It'll be a good harvest, I hope.
I see some of last year's
harvesters are back.
For the rest, here are the rules.
As you move down the rows,
cut to your left, never to the right.
Whatever you do, don't cut the verjus.
One question, miss.
What's the verjus?
The verjus
are the tiny green grapes on top.
Don't cut them. They're not ripe.
There.
How are you?
- I'm glad you came.
- Me, too.
That's it.
Here are the keys, Mom.
- You okay?
- Fine, fine.
Mom, we're right next door.
I know, I know.
Bye, Dad.
