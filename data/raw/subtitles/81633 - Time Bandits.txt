[ TV Announcer ]
Yes, folks, Moderna Designs...
present the latest
in kitchen luxury.
The Moderna Wonder Major All-Automatic
Convenience Center-ette...
gives you all the time in the world
to do the things you really want to do.
An infrared
freezer/oven complex...
that can make you a meal
from packet to plate...
in 15 and a half seconds.
The Morrisons have got one that
can do that in eight seconds.
Block of ice to beef bourguignon
in eight seconds.
Lucky things.
Dad, did you know that
the ancient Greek warriors...
had to learn 44 different
ways of unarmed combat ?
Well, at least we've got
a two-speed hedge cutter.
They were trying to kill people 26
different ways with their bare hands.
- [ Watch Beeping ]
- Bedtime for you, Kevin. It's 9:00.
And this King Agamemnon,
he once fought--
Go on, dear.
Your father said.
- Oh, all right.
- The man you all love, Kenny Lange.
Well, that's today's top prize.
Let's meet today's star guest
on Your Money Or Your Life.
Bring them on, girls.
Oh, don't they look gorgeous ?
Oh, they get lovelier
every day.
[ Father ]
Turn that light off !
It is off.
[ Door Rattling ]
[ Horse Neighing ]
[ Neighing Continues ]
[ Door Opens ]
What the hell
is going on up here ?
I told you to put that light out
and get to bed.
- But--
- And no more noise !
It came off just like that.
The whole thermostat.
That's the toaster, the spreader
and the slicer all gone.
- She's in a terrible state.
- Should've bought German.
- Mom ?
- It would've matched her rotissomat.
- Mom, Dad, can I--
- You're going to bed
in good time tonight.
- I was thinking of going to bed now.
- Now ? Certainly not.
-You must wait for your food to go down.
-I haven't eaten any food.
Well, you must eat
your food.
And then wait for it
to go down.
[ Machine Beeping ]
Oh, no !
Not the carvery again.
[ TV Audience Applauding ]
Oh, dear me, Beryl.
Now, all I want to know...
is what famous film star
begins with "C" ?
Do you understand
the question, my darling ?
[ Audience Laughter ]
Come on, Beryl. Come on. Jumbo's
gonna end up in the souffle, Beryl.
You've got to answer it, Beryl.
Come on. Come on, Beryl.
- It's gone down now.
- Come on, Beryl. Come on.
- What ?
- My supper. It's gone down.
I can feel it.
Can I go to bed now ?
Yeah, all right.
Off you go. But no noise.
- What ?
- No noise !
All right. Okay.
[ TV Announcer ]
No, Beryl. Capetown is not a film star.
[ Audience Laughing ]
Oh, dear. Oh, well.
That's Your Money Or Your Life.
[ Siren Wailing ]
[ Yawning ]
[ Toy Humming ]
[ Father ]
Well, it takes money.
[ Mother ]
With a kitchen like that ?
[ Father ]
Our kitchen's all right, isn't it ?
[ Mother ]
Our kitchen is light-years behind.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Clattering ]
[ Clattering Continues ]
- Where are we ?
- I don't know.
- Well, look at the map.
- It's not on the map.
- Is he coming after us ?
- I think we gave him the slip.
[ All Screaming ]
It's him !
Run for it !
- Which way ?
- This way. Careful.
[ All Shouting ]
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
We can explain everything, sir.
It's not as bad as it looks.
We just borrowed the map.
Sort of got rather happy
about it, and, uh...
ran off in high spirits.
Yeah, we did.
Who are you ?
That's not him.
It didn't sound
like him, did it ?
It doesn't even
look like him.
- It isn't him.
- Let's get him !
[ All Shouting ]
Strutter, get his torch.
Shine it right in the face.
His face, dummy !
[ Strutter ]
It's a kid !
Og, Fidgit,
check the door.
All clear.
Strutter, the light.
Just tell us how we get out of here,
keep quiet and you won't get hurt.
Wh-Why don't you get out
the way you came ?
Don't try and be smart
with me, you little creep.
Yeah.
If you want to play it smart,
I'll introduce you to Vermin.
He eats anything,
you know.
I'm not trying to be smart.
I'm just trying to help.
- You know, don't you ?
- I don't know anything.
You know, and you're
not going to tell us.
- I'm getting angry,
and Vermin's getting hungry.
- I don't know !
- He's found it !
- What ?
- The way out.
- It's never done that before.
Come on, you lot, push !
[ Men Grunting ]
Oh, no !
Not like that !
Wait for me to give
the order, all right ?
Ready ? One--
[ Men Grunting ]
Stop ! Stop !
You never start on one.
Who ever heard of anybody
starting anything on one ?
- What is it then, two or three ?
- Three.
- [ Men Grunting ]
- And push !
- It's him !
- He's found us !
Help us ! Please !
Help us !
- Come on !
- Who is that ?
Return what you
have stolen from me !
Return !
Return the map !
It will bring you
great danger !
Stop ! Now !
[ All Screaming ]
[ Quacking ]
[ Screaming Continues ]
[ Groaning, Shouting ]
- Where are we ?
- I'm stuck !
Quick ! The barn !
Get under here.
Hold him, Strutter.
[ Kevin Whimpering ]
Shut up !
All clear. Wally ?
Yeah.
- Strutter ?
- Yeah.
- Move it. Go.
- Okay.
- Fidgit ?
- Yeah.
Where are we ?
What happened to my bedroom ?
Who was that man ?
That was no man.
That was the Supreme Being.
You mean God ?
We don't know him that well.
We only work for Him.
Shut up !
Now, are we all here ?
- What ?
- Og, are you here ?
- Yeah, he's here.
- Vermin ?
[ Chickens Clucking ]
Vermin, will you stop eating !
It's too dangerous to stay here.
He's probably still after us.
So we better keep moving.
Hey, where are you going ?
- Hey, where are you going ?
- Get him ! He'll give us away.
[ All Shouting ]
Help ! Help !
[ Horses Neighing ]
[ Men Shouting ln French ]
Farmers !
[ Man Shouts ]
Look what you've done, boy.
Sorry.
What town is that ?
Castiglione, or what
Napoleon's left of it.
- Napoleon ?
- Yes. It's his city now.
Come on, boy.
You come with us.
No, thanks.
Come with us
if you know what's good for you.
You're going the wrong way.
Napoleon ?
- Get down !
- You nearly got us caught !
You silly fool.
You could've ruined everything.
- Do you know where we are ?
- Shut up. Of course I do.
1796.
Battle of Castiglione.
See ?
Are you sure we're not
in somebody's bedroom ?
Look, do you want to be
leader of this gang ?
- We agreed no leader.
- Right. So shut up and do as I say.
Now, we've got to get
into the city.
We can't.
The roads are too dangerous.
I've got an idea.
We can use the river.
Come on !
[ Explosion ]
[ Man Shouting ]
Aaaah !
[ Explosion ]
[ Horse Neighing ]
What are we
going to do here ?
- A robbery.
- Shhh.
- A robbery ?
- Of course.
We're international
criminals. We do robberies.
[ Randall ]
Shut up back there.
[ Townspeople Screaming ]
Aim ! Fire !
[ Explosions Continue ]
Take aim ! Fire !
[ Man Laughing ]
[ Laughing Continues ]
[ lndistinct Noises ]
That's him.
You're not gonna rob him ?
Yeah. Every single
penny he's got.
- But that's Napoleon.
- And he's rich.
[ Laughing Continues ]
Monsieur Commander...
I think that the mayor of
Castiglione and his council...
would like very much
to surrender now, please.
Look at that !
Look at the little fellow !
[ Napoleon Laughing ]
With the city, we have the whole area
of western Lombardy at our feet.
Oh, go away !
I never should've
married you !
- [ Whimpering ]
- Oh, stop it !
[ Laughing ]
Yes ! Yes !
Mon Commander,
they are very keen to surrender.
They have been here
eight hours.
Don't stand so close
to me, Neguy !
I've told you
about that before.
You on one side
and him on the other--
It's like being on the bottom
of a bloody well !
Just because
you think I'm small.
No, Commander, you are
not small at all.
No, not by any means.
Five-foot-one is not small.
Yeah, five-foot-one
and conqueror of ltaly.
- Not bad, huh ?
- Very, very good.
[ Puppets Chattering,
Gunshot ]
- Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
- What just happened ?
Where'd they-- I just--
[ Puppeteer Groaning ]
[ Puppeteer Gasps ]
Bravo !
[ Napoleon ]
More ! I want more !
- I-- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Encore !
I wonder if you would like
to see some of our other items.
We have Zuzu and Benny.
## [ Fanfare ]
Fun on a unicycle.
No ?
How about
the Great Rumbozo ?
He sing
and lift heavy things.
No. How about, uh--
Come on.
[ Laughs ]
This I think you'll like.
It's very funny.
The Three ldiots...
uh, from Latvia.
It's a very funny act.
They swallow brushes.
No, no !
They're all freaks !
Not one of them
under five-foot-six.
What kind of theater
are you running, huh ?
I'm sorry, sir, but--
No, no.
More of the funny show,
the little puppets
hitting each other.
That's what I like !
Little things hitting each other !
[ Cannon Blasts ]
[ Whimpers, Groans ]
[ Quiet Chattering ]
Come on.
Psst.
- Huh ?
- Play something like this.
Tsk. Hmm.
# Like the wallpaper
sticks to the wall #

# Strolling down the avenue #
# Avenue, avenue, avenue #

Well, what do you think ?
[ Quarreling Continues ]
Marvelous show.
Young man, you stick with these boys,
you have a great future.
[ Laughing ]
You know, you are
the best thing...
to happen to me
since this whole campaign.
You know, I come
to conquer ltaly...
because I thought they
were all small, you know ?
I heard they was
really tiny guys.
Sir, I really think there
are more important things--
Shut up !
Don't you dare to tell me
my business.
You are dismissed, you hear ?
You, Lucien, the rest of you.
Great streaks of misery.
- But sir--
- No !
I'm going to have
some new generals for a bit.
[ Napoleon ]
Alexander the Great...
five feet exactly.
Isn't that incredible ?
Alexander the Great, whose empire
stretched from lndia to Hungary--
One inch shorter than me.
[ Laughs ]
[ Polite Laughter ]
[ Clock Chimes ]
Oliver Cromwell...
the only man with any guts
in British history--
Not a big man at all.
[ Dog Barking ]
Louis IV, 5' 21/2".
[ Laughing ]
Charlemagne...
a dumpy little five-footer.
- [ Snoring ]
- Squatty little chap.
Attila the Hun, 5' 11/2".
Cyrano de Bergerac,
5' 31/2".
Tamburlaine the Great,
four-foot-nine...
and three quarters.
[ Drops Glass ]
Wasn't he interesting ?
Strutter, wake up.
Wake up.
According to this map, there's a time
hole outside. See if you can find it.
- Right.
- The rest of you, the hole
disappears at 12:00, right ?
So let's get moving.
Vermin, Fidgit,
the tapestry.
Hey, that's 16th century !
It's nice, isn't it ?
Get it !
Okay.
[ Shouting ]
We're rich !
We're rich !
Ten-hut !
[ Snoring ]
[ Laughing ]
- Come on. We've got 30 seconds left.
- You found the time hole ?
- Yes.
- Let's go.
[ Snoring Continues ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Come on, Kevin.
[ Chattering Continues ]
[ Clock Chiming ]
Ten-hut !
About turn !
[ Clock Chiming ]
- [ Guard ] Stop !
- Go !
Thieves !
After them !
- Follow them !
- [ All Shouting ]
[ Groaning ]
Oh, Sir Vincent,
you came for me !
Oh, Good Mistress Pansy,
I could not have ridden faster.
Four horses have I exhausted
this day from Nottingham.
Oh, the way you leapt to my chamber,
so full of... manliness.
I could scarce restrain
the rushing of my feet.
These 12 long years have been
like chains that bound me.
Oh. And the personal
problem ?
- Much, much better.
- Ohhh.
And now we will ride full tilt to Dover,
and there embark for France.
Oh, you don't have
to wear the special--
No, no, I don't have to wear
the special-- anymore.
Oh, Pansy.
No more worries now, Pansy.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- No. No.
- [ Whistling Noise ]
[ Shouting, Muttering ]
- [ Pansy Screaming ]
- [ Horses Neighing ]
[ Shouting Continues ]
- Hey !
- [ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing Continues ]
- Quick ! Quick !
- [ Randall ] We did it !
- Your problem, Vincent.
- Forget the problem. Get me the money.
- We did it ! We did it !
- [ All Laughing ]
I told you. You stick with me,
and you won't go far wrong.
Sometimes I almost
believe you, Randall.
- Hey, where are we ?
- Where are we ?
Why, it's obvious.
We're, um--
[ Pansy ] Vincent, don't
worry about a thing.
[ Vincent ]
I'm not worrying.
- Exactly--
- In the Middle Ages.
Hmm... in
the Middle Ages.
Five-hundred years before the man
we just robbed was even born.
- Fantastic !
- Try that one in a court of law.
Vermin, that is not
meant to be eaten.
You never know
until you've eaten it.
Is it always like this
when you've done a raid ?
I don't know.
We've never done one before.
But I thought you were
international criminals.
Going to be.
Going to be.
Yeah, going to be.
Aren't we ? Going to be ?
Especially now
that we've got you, Kevin.
Hang on. He's just a kid.
He's not one of us.
He knows an awful lot.
Yeah, and he's bigger
than any of us.
- Do you really want to join us ?
- Can we really go anywhere ?
You name it.
If it's down here.
[ Laughing, Cheering ]
I don't understand.
What's so special about that map ?
This map used to belong
to the Supreme Being.
- You stole it ?
- No. Well, sort of.
He used to be our employer.
He made all the big stuff,
Iike good and evil,
men and women, night and day.
And when He did trees and shrubs,
we helped make all this.
Whew, that's not bad.
Yeah, and did we get a thimble
full of credit for it ?
No, all we got was the sack,
just for creating the Pink Bunkadoo.
- Pink Bunkadoo ?
- Yeah. Beautiful tree that was.
- Og designed it, didn't you ? Yeah.
- [ Muttering ]
Six-hundred feet high,
bright red and smelled terrible.
As a disciplinary measure, we were
sent down to the repairs department.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
- What ?
You see, to be quite frank, the fabric
of the universe is far from perfect.
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.
And that's where this comes in.
This is the only map of all the holes.
Well, why repair them ?
Why not use them to get stinkin' rich ?
Yeah, stinkin' rich !
- [ Laughs ]
- Lads, here's to stinkin' rich !
Stinkin' rich.
Stinkin' rich.
- And to Kevin !
- Yeah, Kevin !
- Here's to Kevin !
- Stinkin' Kevin !
Hey, hold it there.
- [ Chattering ]
- Smile.
- Hey, the map.
- Yeah, the map. Don't forget the map.
[ Kevin ]
Hey, come on ! Smile !
[ Pansy ]
Help ! Robbers !
- Hey, that's us !
- Someone's in trouble. Come on !
[ Randall ]
Grab the loot.
[ Pansy Continues Screaming ]
- [ Robbers Shouting ]
- It's a bit tight.
[ Robbers Laughing ]
- Now, those are our sort of people.
- Yeah !
[ Shouting,
Laughing Continue ]
Vincent ! Oh !
Oh, dear !
- [ Pansy ] Help !
- Come on.
Oh, Vincent,
someone's coming.
- [ Whimpering ]
- Help ! Help I say !
Oh, at last.
Oh, I say !
I say, my fiance and I would appreciate
a bit of assistance.
- Oh, no ! The problem, Pansy !
- Oh ! Oh !
- It's started again ! Oh ! Oh !
- Oh, don't worry, darling.
- I say !
- I must have fruit !
[ Wolf Howling ]
- Where are we ?
- We've lost them.
Come on.
Don't be so wet.
[ All Yelling ]
- [ Muttering ]
- [ Kevin ] Hey !
What do we do now,
Randall ?
Just leave this to me, Wally.
We've just got to treat them right.
What do you want,
you tatty-faced old scumbag ?
- What's your business, gob face ?
- We're robbers !
- Villainous robbers ?
- The worst.
- Stop at nothing ?
- Nothing at all.
- Steal a cup outta a beggar's hands ?
- Rather.
- The teeth from blind old ladies ?
- Of course.
- Toys from children ?
- Whenever we can.
[ Both Growling ]
Right.
Let 'em down !
They always crack
in the end.
[ Grunting, Groaning ]
Wow.
Listen, I've got a few ideas
for, uh, a linkup...
between your gang
and our gang,
but I only want
to talk to the boss.
The boss ?
- The boss ?
- That's right.
They serious ?
Ohhh.
[ Men Shouting, Cheering ]
[ Bones Crunching ]
All right ! Do it !
[ Laughs ]
Anyone else wanna go ?
Come on, you weasels.
What's this ?
Lose yourself, leprechaun.
[ Laughing ]
[ Spitballs Clinking ]
Move yourself, lad.
[ Chattering, Laughter ]
[ Ding ]
- That's disgusting !
- Wait here ! I'll get him !
[ Flies Buzzing ]
Hello. I-I'm Hood.
- It's Robin Hood.
- Yeah.
- [ Shouts ]
- Say good morning, you scum.
Good morning, scum.
- Good morning.
You're all robbers, then ?
- The best, Mr. Hood.
Jolly good.
And you're a robber, are you ?
Jolly good.
And do you enjoy
robbing, then ?
Well, it helps
pay the rent, sir.
[ Laughing ]
Jolly good.
And you're a robber too ?
How long have you been a robber ?
- Four-foot-one.
- Good Lord !
- Jolly good. Four-foot-one ?
- Yes.
Well, th-th-th-that is
a long time, isn't it ?
Well now, I hear you've made
a pretty good haul.
Well, see for yourself, sir.
Gosh ! I say !
Crikey ! I mean,
I've been in robbing for years,
but I've never seen
anything like this.
Crumbs ! And you acquired
all of this by yourselves ?
Well, it was a good day,
Mr. Hood.
- Jolly good day !
- It's nice, isn't it ?
Rather ! Well, I mean,
what can I say ? Thank you.
Thank you all
very, very much indeed.
Oh, don't ment-- What ?
Well, I mean,
it's frightfully kind of you.
The poor are going to be
absolutely thrilled.
- Have you met them ?
- Who ? The poor ?
Oh, you must meet them.
I just know you'll like them.
Of course, they haven't
got two pennies to rub together.
- But that's because they're poor.
- [ All Laughing ]
Uh, Marion, would you be so kind
as to ask the poor to come in, please ?
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.
- Right. Come on, you lot.
- Let's just see what we've got.
This is going to be
so much help in our work.
No, you don't understand.
All this stuff is ours. We stole it.
Oh, yes, I know, and believe you me the
poor are going to be not just thrilled,
but also considerably less poor,
aren't they, Redgrave ?
- [ Gibberish ]
- You see ? What did he say ?
- He said, "Yeah, what with
Christmas coming up and all."
- Ah, jolly good.
Yes, well, there we are.
Congratulations. Well done.
[ Laughter ]
There we are. Well done.
Congratulations.
[ Laughing, Cheering ]
Is that-- Is that
absolutely necessary ?
- [ Gibberish ]
- What did he say ?
- He says, yeah, he's afraid it is.
- Ah, fine. Fine.
There we are, madam.
Congratulations.
- Congratulations. Jolly good.
- Thank you.
[ Laughing Continues ]
Incidentally, would any of you like
to stay on and help us with our work ?
There's still so much wealth
to redistribute.
Oh, I'd like to stay.
Jolly good.
What's your name ?
- Uh, Ke--
- Ke-- What a jolly nice name.
- Let me go.
- Well, never mind.
- Cheerio. Thank you very much.
- [ Kevin Struggling ]
Thank you very much.
Thank you very, very,
very, very much.
Awful people.
- This can't wait !
- I'll never get a chance
to meet Robin Hood again.
- Any chance of a rescue ?
- Stop moaning !
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.
Giving away
what isn't even his !
That's what Robin Hood
always did. Even I know that.
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.
Heroes ! Heroes !
What do they know about a day's work ?
- Leave him alone, Randall !
- Well, it makes me sick.
Anyone who's always right
makes me sick.
- That's why you get on with yourself !
- Watch it !
- Big mouth !
- Horseflesh wouldn't
have got us into this.
- Horseflesh is dead.
- Then give me the map.
I'm taking over !
Get off me ! Get--
[ Arguing Continues ]
[ Thunderclap ]
So... these are
the sort of people...
the Supreme Being
allows to steal His map ?
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.
I wouldn't entrust them
to wipe their own noses.
Oh, no, sir. It's much
too difficult for them.
What sort of supreme being
created such riffraff ?
Is it not the workings
of a complete incompetent ?
But He created you,
Evil One.
What did you say ?
Well, He created you,
so He can't be totally--
Never talk to me
like that again !
No one created me !
I am Evil !
Evil existed
long before good.
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.
I am all-powerful !
Yeah.
But why,
if that's the case,
are you unable to escape
from this fortress ?
That's a good question.
Why have I let the Supreme Being
keep me here...
in the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness ?
- Because you--
- Oh, shut up.
I'm speaking rhetorically.
- Of course.
- I let Him keep me here...
in order to lull Him
into a false sense of security.
Ah, clever, clever.
When I have the map,
I will be free...
and the world will be different
because I have understanding.
- Uh, understanding of what, master ?
- Of digital watches.
Soon I shall have understanding of video
cassette recorders and car telephones.
And when I have understanding of them,
I shall have understanding of computers.
And when I have understanding of
computers, I shall be the Supreme Being.
God isn't interested
in technology.
He knows nothing of the potential of the
micro-chip or the silicon revolution.
Look how He spends His time.
Forty-three species of parrots !
- Nipples for men !
- Slugs.
Slugs ! He created slugs.
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.
Are we not in the hands
of a lunatic ?
Sir... Iook !
If I were creating a world,
I wouldn't mess about
with butterflies and daffodils.
I would have started
with lasers, 8:00 day one.
- [ Assistant Gasps ]
- Sorry.
I just can't wait for a new tech--
techno-- technological dawn.
Sir... Iook !
What is it, Benson ?
The map, sir. The map !
They've brought it with them !
- What ?
- I saw the map, master, just now.
- Are you sure ?
- I'm sure, master.
Down there !
The little one has it.
The little one ?
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for !
- It will set us free.
- Shut up !
If you're wrong, Benson,
my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.
I will turn you inside out
over a very long period of time.
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.
Now we must bait the hook,
see if they bite...
and pull them in.
Stand by for mind control.
What about Babylon ?
- Who ?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.
Ahh.
[ Voice Echoing ]
I've got a better idea.
Who said that ?
I've got an idea
forming in my head.
You haven't had an idea
for thousands of years.
There is a place where we could find
the greatest thing man could want,
the goal of everybody's
hopes and dreams.
What the hell
are you talking about ?
The most fabulous
object in the world.
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.
They're hooked,
the greedy little fish.
- [ Kevin ] Why do you always
have to go after money ?
- Who's this ?
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he ?
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them !
Randall, look, over there !
- We'd better move !
- [ Randall ] Don't rush me.
The forest !
It's on fire !
It's raining,
pudding head !
- Oh, no !
- What is it ?
- It's Him !
- It's Him !
Return the map.
- Make for the hole !
- Where is it ?
It's over there.
Quick ! Come on !
- Stop ! Return !
- Hurry up !
Return what you
have stolen from me.
Return the map !
There are two holes, Randall.
Which one ? Which one ?
Go, Kevin !
Just get away !
Go ! Not that one !

Where did you
come from ? Huh ?
I'm not quite sure.
Who sent you ?
The gods ?
Was it Zeus ?
Apollo ?
Athena ?
[ Panting, Sighing ]
Well, you're certainly a chatty
little fellow, aren't you ?
I don't believe it !
You don't believe what ?
I don't believe
the way you killed him.
Yes. But it
has to be done sometimes.
No. I mean it was
such a good shot.
I bet you've killed
lots of people.
Well, the gods must
have given you a name.
Oh, yeah. Kevin.
Kevin ?
Well, Kevin,
here, it's yours.
- What ?
- You don't want it ?
Oh, yes, please.
You mean I can really have it ?
Well, on condition that you
carry it back to the city for me.
Oh, great. But no,
I can't really.
I must wait. You see,
I'm with friends.
You see, if I lose them,
I may never be able to get back.
- [ Horse Whinnies ]
- Get back ? To where ?
I'm not really sure.
Here, you better take this.
You'll need it. It's water.
There's enough there for your friends,
too, if they ever turn up.
[ Horse Whinnies ]
Oh, and by the way,
thank you.
No. Please.
I'd like to come, really.
No, no, please.
I'd like to come.

It must have been a brilliant battle.
Choo ! Choo !
All three are to receive
summary executions today.
If the queen wishes to see me,
I'll be in the courts all afternoon.
Remind the queen that
I still rule this city.
I wish I'd been
in the Trojan Wars.
Will you teach me
how to sword fight ?
Come here. I'll teach you
something much more useful.
- Where is it ?
- There.
That one.
Kings aren't supposed
to do things like that.

Thank you very much.
Thank you.

- I like that. It's very nice.
Oh.
Six more plates
of caviar, please.
Anyone else want any ?
No, none for me, thank you.
I'll stick with the quail's eyeballs.
The caviar makes me throw up,
you know.
- [ Man ] Waiter.
- Sorry, Randall. Sorry.
Cheer up, Kevin. Kings aren't
the only ones with money, you know.
The money wasn't important
to him.
He didn't have anything
to spend it on, did he ?
Stuck out in Greece-- Iowest

What ?
Things are looking better all the time.
- I've got something to say to you.

The map ?
I don't understand you, Randall.
You've got something
really brilliant like that,
- and you're just wasting it.
- [ Scoffs ]
I wouldn't call this exactly...
wasting it.
Why couldn't you leave me
where I was happy ?
Because when you hear
what I've got planned,
- you're gonna be a lot happier.
- [ Glass Clinks, Water Splashes ]
I was havin' a close look at the map
last night. Do you know what I found ?
Og was right.
The most fabulous object in the world.
It does exist.
Look.
- The time of legends--
- The time of legends !
There's no such thing.
But there is.
You just gotta believe in it.
Otherwise, Horseflesh
wouldn't have put it on the map.
"In the middle of the time of legends
is a fortress of ultimate darkness,
and inside the fortress
of ultimate darkness,
the most fabulous object
in the world."
Give it up, Randall.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
- Look.
- You and me-- we got a lot in common.
- [ Coughs ]
- Not like that Og.
- [ Laughing ]
We like a risk.
- We like adventure.
- [ Coughing Continues ]
Well, this is it.
This is the big one.
No namby-pamby

We risk all.
We win everything.

Hello !
I want to go home !
I can't stand it !
You'll get us all killed,

Stop whimpering, Fidgit !
How could I know we were gonna
run slap-bang into an iceberg ?
It didn't say "Get off before
the iceberg" on the ticket.
Now-- Now is the time...
to star-- to start our quest for the--
for the most fabulous object, Randall.
- Og's right ! I've got the map.
- No !
- Let's go !
- What ?
Randall, we are in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean !
It doesn't matter where we are.
You just gotta believe in it !
You're crazy !
- We must try !
- No, don't !
- Abandon plank !

No. It's your nerves, dear.
Here we are, darling.
[ Groaning ]
Come on.
- [ Grunting ]
- And the ointment for the leg.
I grew too fast
when I was young.
- That was the problem.
- You've been overdoing it a bit, dear.
You try being beastly and terrifying
when you-- [ Gasping ]
you can only get one hour's sleep
a night because your back hurts,
and you daren't cough
in case you pull a muscle.
But you are horrible, dear.
You're just sayin' that.

Look at these bloody spots.
That's diet, that is.
- You'll outgrow them, dear.
- Look at all this bloody fish !
[ Grunting ] There used to be
a time when you could be sure...
of catchin'
old boots, cans,
hatracks, boxes.
Now it's prawns
all the bloody time !
Anti-pollution ! Wife !
What d'you want, dear?
Do you want the foot powder ?
No ! Come out here
and help me !
- Quick !
- Dear.
- What's in there ?
- I don't know, but it's not prawns.
- [ Grunting, Groaning ]
- Here.
Here, dear.
Leave that to me, please.
- Yeah.
- [ Yells ]
Aren't they lovely ?
We can have them for breakfast.
Ah, you mean
eat their boots ?
No, dear.
I mean, eat all of them.
Every little bit.
That means the big pot
and the large skewers.
- [ Whimpering, Grunting ]
- What shall I do, dear ?
Terrify them.
Oh, but what about me back ?
Well, you don't have
to jump around.
Just shout horribly...
and leer at them.
You know,
the way you used to.

There's nothing over there !

Y-You've been saying that
for the last 40 miles !
Let's go back !
We'll all die out here !
- Yeah !
- You can't give up now.
- When can we give up ?
- Come on. It's just a big further--
What is it ?
I don't know,
but it hurts.
It's some kind
of invisible barrier.
Oh ! So that's what
an invisible barrier looks like.
It's what this line
must be.
And just on the other side,
the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness.
We've made it, lads !
We're here !
You're mad, Randall !
Your brain's gone.
Do you know that ?
I promise you,
this is it !
We are here !

You'll never get back
without me.
Do you wanna bet ?

You give that back,
or I'll take your head off.

Look at this.

- Good one of Wally.
No ! Look !
It's the map !
I can see it's the map.
What use is that to us now ?
Look, closer.
The time of legends, see ?
See the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness ?
- That's a hole ?
- Exactly !
- It could lead almost anywhere.
- Everywhere !
- What ?
- We just found the biggest
hole in the universe,
and it's practically below
our feet !
Kevin, you're a genius !
- Come on, you lot ! Shift !
- We'll never get out of here !
Wanna bet ?
No !
That's right, Og. Show 'em we can do
something right for a change.
That's it.
Let's have that.
Give us some more.
That's enough, Wally !
Okay, Strutter.
- Have you got the rope ?
- Hold on !
[ Grunting ]
Right.
Hold tight !
Keep straight !
- Watch your feet. Watch your feet.
- Easy.

Hold it.
Steady. Watch it.
Watch it.
Hold your fingers.

- Well, we've done it.
- Yeah, we've done it.
- Now all we need is the map.
- What ? [ Laughing ]
We don't need the map.
We know where the time hole is.
Let's get out of here.
- But Evil's got the map, Randall !
- Oh, damn right, yes.
Last thing we want to do
is see him again. Come on.
But you can't leave it with him,
or he'll destroy the world !
Oh, Robert, Benson,
I feel the power of evil
coursing through my veins,
filling every corner of my being
with the desire to do wrong.
- I feel so bad, Benson.
- Good ! Good !
Yes, it is good, for this is the worst
kind of badness that I'm feeling.
- Kill me, master ! Kill me !
- Not now, Benson. We have work to do.
No less a work than the overthrowing
of creation itself.
We will remake man
in our image, not His.
We will turn mountains
into sea,
and the skies into rivers,
and fjords into deserts.
- Come on ! Come on !
- And deserts into quagmires.
The boy's insane.
We can't go in there.
Shh !
Oh !
- Let me see !
- And icebergs into fire !
And the fire into a mighty
rushing wind which will cover
the face of the earth...
and wipe clean the scourge of woolly
thinking once and for all.
We can make beans
into peas !
Oh, Benson.
Dear Benson, you are so mercifully free
of the ravages of intelligence.
- You say... such nice things, master.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
Now, Benson, I shall have to turn you
into a dog for a while.
Thank you, master.
[ Grunting ]
Stay, Benson.
Guard the map.
Robert, we must plan
a new world together.
This time
we'll start it properly.
Tell me about computers.
Uh, a computer
is an automatic electronic apparatus...
for making calculations.
[ Robert ]
Or controlling operations...
- [ Creaking ]
- that are expressible...
in numerical
or logical terms.
[ Evil ]
And fast breeder reactors ?
[ Robert ]
Ah, fast breeder reactors...
use a fast fission process...
for the generation
of fissile isotopes.
[ Growling ]
[ Growling Continues ]
- Be quiet, Benson !
- [ Growling, Whimpering ]
Show me more, Robert.
Show me--
Show me...

I must know everything.

Stop !

Stop them by every means
in my power !

We're trapped.
- We've got to separate.
- What ?
Go down the time hole.
Go wherever you can and get help.
- I'll divert them.
- But you can't do it on your own.
No. I'll take one other.
- Well done, Og.
- [ Snorts ]
Yes. Og and me'll stay.
Ready ?
- Hey ! Hey ! This way !
- [ Shrieking Continues ]
- [ Snorting ]
- [ Gasps ]
[ Shrieking ]
You are a very troublesome
little fellow.
I think I should teach you
one of my special lessons.
What do you think, Robert ?
[ Evil ]
Benson, what would look nice ?
Half donkey ?
Half warthog ?
Half oyster ?
Half carrot ?
- Or the diseased left tonsil--
- [ Shrieking Continues ]
Call off those, those creatures,
or I'll destroy the map forever.
- Don't, don't be so stupid.
- Call them off !
Very well.
I have no need of them.
- Robert.
- Yes, master ?
Your time has come.
[ Gasps ]
Oh, wonderful, master ! Wonderful !
- Wonderful !
- Don't mention it.
Benson.
[ Yelling ]
I'm a reasonable man.
Give me the map,
and you might at least walk out
of here on human feet.
- [ Snorts ]

[ Whistle Blowing ]
[ Snorting ]
[ Horses Whinnying ]
This way, men.
Over there.
- Wally !
- [ Gunshots ]
[ Whinnying ]
[ Cheering, Hooting ]
- Where's the trouble, sonny ?
- Down there !
[ Cowboy ]
Aha !
So... this is the best...
the Supreme Being can do.
[ Scoffs ]
I guess we'll have
a lynchin', eh ? Yippee !
[ Gunshots, Cheering ]
- Wait !
- [ Gunshots, Hooting Continue ]
Got him !
- [ Whinnying ]
See, sonny ? No problem.
[ Yelling ]
[ Yelling Continues ]
Wait a minute !
Wait !
Wait a minute !
Oh ! Oh ! Hey !
Hold on ! Hey ! Hey !
- Let me go !
- I don't feel so good !
## [ Carnival ]
[ Screaming ]
Fire !
[ Laughing ]
[ Hissing ]
- [ Grunting ]
- Look out !
[ Screaming ]
Charge !
[ Tires Screeching, Crashing ]
[ Whinnying ]
Strutter ! Quick !
Strutter !
Next !
Get him !
Randall, go !
Go !
- I can't control it !
- Of course you can't, you silly man.
I control them !
[ Randall ]
Hurry ! Help me !
[ Yelling Continues ]
[ Wally ]
Get me down !
Stay where you are !
Something's happening !
[ Whimpering ]
Get out of the way, Fidgit !
Get out of the way !
[ Screaming ]
- Fidgit !
- Hey ! Hey, Fidgit !
Fidgit !
Quick ! Push it off him !
Push it off. Quick.
- He's dead.
- What ?
Fidgit's dead.
[ Whimpering ]
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- It wasn't your fault, Wally.
- It was, it was his fault.
- Get down, Wally !
- Get down !
- Wally ! Get down, Wally !
- Evil !
- [ All Shouting At Once ]
- Come on back !
Evil !
He killed my friend !
I'll kill him !
Get off me !
Get down !
- [ Shouting Continues ]
- I'll kill him !
[ Laughing ]
[ Whimpering ]
Huh ?
- Oh, no !
- He's found us !
Quick ! Ron for it !
Oh ! I hate
having to appear like that.
Really,
it's the most tiresome way.
Noisy manifestation.
Still, rather expected
of one, I suppose.
Get down ! Get down !
O Great One !
O Supreme Being !
O Creator of all the universe,
without whom we would be naught
but scarab beetles on the--
What a dreadful mess !
Is the pig with you ?
[ Snorts ]
Right.
Well, we'll sort him out first.
- [ Squealing ]
- Og !
- Og, here ! Quick ! Out of the way !
- I was enjoying that.
One thing I can't stand,
it's mess.
I want all this stuff
picked up.
[ All ] Yes, sir.
Anything you say.
- Anything you say, sir.
- Wally, tidy up !
But, but he's dead, Randall.
Fidgit, Fidgit's dead.
Dead ?
No excuse for laying off work.
- Fidgit.
- [ Whispering ] Fidgit.
- Fidgit ?
- [ Cheering ]
- What happened ?
- I'm sorry I killed you, Fidgit.
He's okay !
He's okay !
Oh, do hurry up.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I'd like to explain everything.
We didn't mean to steal the map.
We didn't mean to run away--
What do you mean, you didn't
mean to steal the map ?
- It, it just sort of--
- Of course you didn't mean to steal it.
I gave it to you.
You silly man. And that.
- Do you really think I didn't know ?
- Sir ?
I had to have some way
of testing my handiwork.
I think it turned out
rather well.
- Don't you ?
- Hmm ?
Evil turned out rather well.
Mm-hmm.
Whose are these ?
Mine, sir.
They're mine, sir.
You really are an untidy boy.
Sign... here.
Do you mean you knew
what was happening to us all the time ?
Well, of course.
I am the Supreme Being.
- I'm not entirely dim.
- Oh, no, sir.
We're not suggesting that, sir.
It's just--
That I let you borrow
my map.
Now I want every bit of Evil...
placed in here.
- Right away.
- Of course, sir.
Come on.
You mean you let all those people die,
just to test your creation ?
Yes.
You really are a clever boy.
Why did they have to die ?
You might as well say,
"Why do we have to have evil ?"
Oh, we wouldn't dream of asking
a question like that, sir.
Yes. Why do we have
to have evil ?
Ah.
- I think it's something
to do with freewill.
- [ Dwarves Grunting ]
Do be careful.
You weren't watching.
Don't lose any of that stuff.
That's concentrated evil.
One drop of that could turn
you all into hermit crabs.
I'm sorry, sir.
I, I was just wondering
if there's, um,
any chance we might
have our old jobs back, sir.
- Oh, you certainly were
appallingly bad robbers.
- Yes, sir.
I really should do something
very extrovert and vengeful with you.
Honestly, I'm too tired.
But I think I'll just transfer you
to the undergrowth department--
yes, bracken, small shrubs--
that sort of thing--
with a 19%%% cut in salary
backdated to the beginning of time.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Well, I am the nice one.
Is it all ready ? Right !
Come on, then.
Back to creation.
- I mustn't waste any more time.
- Bye, Kevin.
They'll think I've lost control
again and put it all down to evolution.
- Come on.
- Sir ?
- Yes ?
- What about my friend, sir ?
Can he come with us ?
No, of course not.
This isn't a school outing.
But, sir,
he deserves something.
- I mean, without him--
- Oh, don't go on about it.
- He's got to stay here
to carry on the fight.
- Fidgit !
[ Randall ]
Come on. Fidgit !
Hey ! You can't go !
- Hey, you can't leave me !
- Fidgit !
- Fidgit, come on !
- Wait, please !
- Come on, Fidgit !
- Hey ! Stop !
Hey !
Hey ! Don't leave me !
Hey ! Help ! Stop !
[ Coughing ]
Don't go ! Help ! Don't leave me !
Hey ! Don't go ! Stop !
- Don't leave me ! Please ! Wait !
- [ Siren Wailing ]
[ Coughing ]
Don't leave me ! Please !
[ Siren Stops ]
[ Loud Crashing ]
Come on ! Come on !
[ Fireman ]
Let's go !
- [ Coughing ]
- [ Sirens Wailing ]
- Let go ! I've got to save it !
- Don't be a fool, Diane !
- I'm going in for the toaster !
- No ! No !
- Oh, Trevor !
- Me super deluxe steamer !
[ Diane ]
Oh !
- You all right ?
- Yeah.
I think so.
[ Coughing ]
You're a very lucky boy.
Honestly, Trevor.
If you'd been half a man,
you'd have gone in there
after the blender.
[ Siren Fading ]
- This is what started it.
- Eh ?
Left the Sunday joint
cookin' all night, didn't we ?
Sunday joint ?
It's Thursday.
I never touched it !
[ Diane ]
Well, someone put it on.
Well, there was no meat
in there last night.
Oh ! Well, what do you
call this then ?
Mom ! Dad !
It's Evil !
Don't touch it !
[ Siren Wailing ]
Mom ?
Dad ?
