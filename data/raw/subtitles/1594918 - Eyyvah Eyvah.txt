No life-jackets, no radar reflector,
port and starboard lights not working.
No certificate of seaworthiness.
- The boat has no engine either!
- Hüseyin! You little backstabber!
What's true.
We're victims here! Look, chief!
Where's the G? The G's gone!
Cut it out! OK, you were playing at sea.
But why in the path of a ship?
We aren't lunatics, chief.
Why would we want to get in its way?
That Muharrem couldn't get
the engine to start.
He rowed and rowed
but didn't get us here.
What can we do?
It's our bread and butter, chief.
Right, it's bread and butter, chief.
What we do for a living.
Iman Abi said we'd be doing a pam
for the bridegroom.
He said we'd do it in the rowboat.
Go on, tell him, iman Abi!
I said we should have a pam
with the bridegroom. In the harbour.
You need life-jackets of course
if you go out to sea, but well..
Damn you! You screw us over in seconds!
Like you've ever seen a life-jacket!
Tell the truth or
I'll beat you shitless!
Cut it out!
You, fatso. Step forward.
- Write!.. Victim one. What's your name?
- Hüseyin Badem.
- Your mother's name?
- Ayse.
- Your father's name?
- Ali Riza, but it says Halil on my ID.
Who's Halil?
My grandfather. I mean, my ID has
his name on it as my father's name.
- So you use your mother's surname?
- Yes.
- Morning, treasures! What's up?
- Morning, Hüseyin!
Don't wait for me for dinner tonight.
You go ahead, gran.
- What are you up to, Hüseyin?
- Playing at a wedding in Dalyan.
- How much are you getting?
- They said 100 lira each.
Don't spend it all on drink again!
Look who's talking! I haven't seen you
drink water in 45 years!
And you say your liver shows up clean,
however that works.
Your doctor fiddled it!
Of course it's clean. The doctor says
it's like the best lamb's liver.
- Anyway. OK, goodbye.
- Wait, don't go! Here you go.
No way, gran! I'd rather die!
Down with it, young buck!
Look, I've been doing this 30 years
and has it done me any good?!
I've turned into an egg instead!
Go on, drink it!
Bravo, young buck!
Just let it work its magic.
Hatice!
Huh?
Give me some money.
You give me some!
I'm telling you, I'm clean out.
I'll sell the cart and give it back.
That cart will never finish!
The horses will die
before that cart finishes!
You're so stubborn, woman!
So damn stubborn!
God damn you!
Every frigging morning!
Oh my god!
I knew I'd see you.
Just one look and I'd give anything!
Do you have to be so pure?
- Selam aleykum, Murat Alemdar!
- Aleykum selam, Hüseyin Abi!
- So how are things?
- Fine. The usual. Come over.
- Give us a shave then.
- Sure, no problem.
Abi asked about you yesterday.
I sounded him out.
Turns out the girl is sick.
He said you should go and take a look.
Your mobile was switched off.
I said you'd go round in the morning,
that you'd sort her out.
I said greatness in this world
is about not forgetting favours.
I said he'd look out for you one day.
Did I say the right thing?
Are you off your head? You'll cut me!
Which Abi? Which girl?
You know, Yakup Abi.
Why are you talking like that?!
Goddamn psycho! OK, I'll call by.
Now give us that shave!
Hey, OK! Now tilt your head...
and I'll give you a normal shave.
Keep calm or I'll kill you!
Give me a break! OK, OK. Come on.
- She's down.
- Huh?
- Seriously.
- What can I do?
- Don't you take her out?
- Where?
To the shops!
Look, she can't shit. She's all bloated.
Take her out.
But she won't walk!
Of course she won't!
Come here. Look. What's this?
- What's that?
- Her meniscus.
It's a torn meniscus, Yakup Abi.
But she doesn't play football!
Do cows get torn meniscuses?
Sure! Doesn't she have the right?
How's she supposed to wrist her knee?
- Hey! It's Muharrem Agha!
- Welcome, Muharrem!
Thanks, boys!
Why are you tying up the dog, chief?
Let him free, let him wander.
- God help us! No chance, boys!
- Why not?
He's all horny, boys. He won't leave
the bitches round here alone.
He's got the hots for
Gamze's dog at the hotel.
Whenever I look for him, he's there.
He'll get me in hot water with her.
- He's a frigging womanizer!
- What's up, Saban Abi?
Even the dog's better at it than me!
Hüseyin, I have big problems, son.
Well, you'd understand.
You know those pills?
The ones that help? Should I ty them?
But they're supposed to be dodgy.
They can give you a heart attack, Abi.
- So what can I do?
- Sea urchins!
Open them up with a knife and mallow.
They help?
Yes! They're organic.
Just the thing. And natural.
- Stop leering or we'll be in trouble.
- What can I do? She's looking at me.
So don't look!
- Enough! What are you? A gypsy?
- But what's wrong?
Sit down! You can dance later.
Come on, sit. Move!
Sema! Wait, girl.
Wait, girl. Wait!
The girl's on the way out!
Stop the music!
She's going to choke.
Hey, stop! You'll choke her.
You've got it all wrong!
Hüseyin! What the hell
are you doing to my sister?
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
- How many fingers?
- Three.
- Now?
- Five.
- Who's that?
- I don't know him.
- No, no. Him.
- She means me.
Iman, the animal! The jerk who smashed
a bottle over my head!
OK, calm down.
Hey, I'm sorry, Hüseyin.
I got the wrong idea. I thought..
What the hell did you think?
I saved the girl's life.
She had a chickpea
stuck in her windpipe.
The only thing to do is press on
her diaphragm. Or turn her upside down.
OK, iman Abi. You go now.
Everything's fine. He's conscious. OK?
Really, I'm sorry, Hüseyin.
- I guess you're into medicine.
- I'm into animals.
I learned by myself, treating animals.
As a hobby, I mean.
My mum knew about breaks and stuff
when she was alive. That helped too.
Real. Anaway, feel better soon.
And let me see you again tomorrow.
- What time? Where?
- Here.
- Yes. By the way, I'm Hüseyin.
- And I'm Müjgan.
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise. Take it a bit easy tonight.
- Sure. I'll just go straight to bed.
- OK.
In the name of God, the Merciful,
be my refuge, Holy Prophet.
Keep my boy from evil, Lord.
Spare him trouble.
Hatice!
What are you shouting about?
Ah! You scared the life out of me!
Why are you out the back, damn you?
The cat ran away. The cat!
I'm looking for her. Did you see her?
- No. You have any cigarettes, Halil?
- Yes.
He has no mother, no father.
We're all he has in life.
- That frightens me.
- But he's OK, thank goodness.
Thank God.
And if we could find him a wife..
That'll happen in good time, Hatice.
Everything in this life is destiny.
Come here, wench!
Look at that!
Granddad, what's going on?
- Huh?
- What are you up to?
- Morning, Hüseyin. What are you up to?
- Fine. The usual. What about you?
- What do you expect?
- What's going on with the wall?
Huh.. I made a mirror. Look!
I'm hanging it there on the wall.
At this time of day for god's sake?!
Granddad?
Have you grown pink roses this year?
Aha. There's more round the back.
I charge 25 lira a rose.
- You charge me as well?
- Yes.
God damn you!
Every frigging morning!
- How are you?
- What about you?
- Fine, thanks. Did it hurt last night?
- Yes.
- Well, that's to be expected.
- Yes.
- Almost over.
- May it never be over.
- What?
- I mean the Turkcell Super League!
- You play the clarinet beautifully.
- Let's hope so.
- Sorry.
- It's all about love.
Well, everyone does a great job
if they love what they do.
Yes.
Well, we're done.
I'm glad you're better.
OK. Thank you.
Have a good day.
- You've forgotten your plant.
- No, I brought the plant for you.
I messed up. Things got out of hand.
You went out of your way. That's why.
- That's very meet of you.
- Yes. Have a good day.
You too.
Saban Abi?
I'm wasted, Hüseyin!
You've done me in. I'm on fire!
- How many did you eat?
- A bucketful.
Oh my god! A dolphin
wouldn't eat that many! Shit!
- How would I know? You didn't say.
- Did it do any good?
It's been pounding since last night.
Like a gong. Is the nurse there?
- What do you want with the nurse?
- To show her of course!
No way! Go to Çanakkale to the doctor.
This is serious.
He ate a bucketful of sea urchins?
Aha. He says it was pounding
like a gong the whole night!
Hey, listen.
How did it go with the bandages?
- Huh?
- Just 'huh' when it doesn't suit you?
He says everyone is needing
hospital attention these days.
He says god grant everyone
a nurse like Müjgan!
Hey, stop winding me up!
That sad tune plays
and Müjgan and I weep..
That sad tune plays
and Müjgan and I weep..
Look, you're out of control!
And slow down a bit, Murat.
But I am driving slowly, Abi.
You aren't! I'm seeing everything
like a film strip.
What a gorgeous girl..
She's messed up my settings.
Hey, boss. Get out of there
and restore the factory settings.
Click options.
Come and click me. Like it's so easy..
This is something far out.
I don't count times without love
as living. I'm serious.
If my tongue was tied
and I could never say your name...
if my eyes were branded
and I could never see your face...
if my hands were tied
and I could never hold your hand...
- Do you think she has a man?
- Well, I've never seen her with anyone.
- Me neither.
- Murat, you?
- Boss.. Abi!
- What the hell's going on?
No, I haven't!
Why did you do that whole thing then?
I'll smash your face in one day!
Whoa! You don't take long to lose it!
You've got to be totally aggressive.
Your personalty's changed.
Hüseyin, it's not on.
It is, it is.
He just got carried away.
His settings are all messed up.
It's normal.
Come on then.
Knock it back! Knock it back!
Enough! We're like crazy cows
after all this knocking it back.
Hey, why are we going to the island?
I'm about to do you the
favour of your life!
- There they are!
- Oh my god!
- Come on, move.
- I'm not coming.
- Come on, Hüseyin! Move!
- I'm not coming. Please, ibo!
Move! What kind of guy are you?
Come on.
- Hello!
- What are you up to?
- I'm fine. You?
- The usual.
- Hello there, Hüseyin.
- Hello, Müjgan.
How's the head?
Fine. It's like there's something
wobbling around inside, but it's fine.
It's mandatory service, right?
You'll be going when it's done?
It's beautiful here actually but..
Life is full of surprises.
- I'm not making any long-term plans.
- I never do.
- Why not?
- They don't work out.
Ah! Dolphins jumping! Look!
Ah! They're blessed, those animals!
It has to be teeming with fish.
They're so beautiful!
You want some?
No, thanks.
Why are you making faces like that?
Is it the apple?
So you've found out! Don't eat it!
Throw it to the dolphins. Go on!
- Ibo!
- Huh?
- I guess my brother knows.
- Knows what?
- About us.
- No way! He'd be on to me if he did.
- If he wasn't, I would.
- But you wouldn't have the heart.
Animal!
Your grandmother reminds me
of my own grandmother, you know?
When I got mad at my parents as a kid,
I always turned to my grandmother.
She was my best friend.
With my child's mind, I'd grab my bag...
and say, "Come on, gran.
Let's us two go. They can stay."
When I got mad with mine as a kid
I'd go to sleep right away.
So I could dream about my father.
I never saw him, never knew him,
never knew what he was like either.
I imagined he was..
This huge man, like a giant.
He'd pick me up with two fingers,
put me on his shoulders...
and we'd wander round
the school playground together.
But it's like we were flying.
All the way to the Ida Mountains.
Your father's dead, isn't he?
Yes. Then one day I met this.
And the dreams finished.
I blow all my cares and worries
into the thing and they're gone.
You know, playing it
is kind of like yelling.
Put it this way,
I've become another pied piper.
Don't say that. Playing the
clarinet is hard, right?
Everything beautiful is hard, Müjgan.
You have to work at it. It's a really
stubborn instrument. It
chooses its players.
Some people play for two months
and can't make a sound.
Some people pick it up once
and it happens first time.
Have a ty.
Let's see if it chooses you.
I don't know.
Look, it's simple.
Go like this with your lips.
Like this?
Yes.
- I can't do it. You play.
- What are you going to pay me?
Your first tune can be on the house.
You've torn my heart out
at this hour of night.
You asked for it.
Hüseyin, don't you have a girl?
I do but..
- Hüseyin, give me some money.
- Hey, what's this all about?
I'd ask your gran, but
she'd never give me any.
She's always thinking of you.
I need money, son.
I have to deliver the cart.
- I can't pay for the axle or varnish.
- I don't have any either, granddad.
No, really?
What the hell is this?
You've saved a fortune here, gran!
What the hell is this?
Ayse Badem.
Ali Rýza Seker.
My dad wrote to my mum?
Son, your mum got all proud about it.
The man doesn't know about you anyway.
He was engaged when he met your mum.
He conned my girl!
We were disgraced! We had to keep
moving around so he wouldn't find us.
Your mum hid all that from you.
We were going to tell you one day.
We were so worried you'd leave, son.
Be worried! You're right! I'll leave!
How can you hide something like that?
What about everything I've been through?
All those stories..
Stories about ships sinking...
about him having no grave,
and them having a religious marriage.
If only you'd told me earlier.
It's worse this way! Speak to me!
It was for your own good, son.
Shut up or you'll make my blood boil!
And you're still on about my own good.
I'm going to find that man!
How will you find him?
All you have is his name and a photo.
The letters were written in Istanbul.
And the address is on the back.
I'll go and find him.
But he must be dead by now.
Oh, Müjgan!
I guess that has to wait.
- Can you come here?
- Yes, Abla?
- I'm in number six.
- OK, Abla. That's here.
- But there's a man here!
- Are you talking about me?
I told them 100 times
to put me next to a woman.
OK, Abla.
Come here, Abi. Come with me.
- There wouldn't have been room anyway.
- Rude git!
Sit down, Abla. Sit down.
OK, Abi.
Look, that seat's free.
You can sit there.
Hold on a second.
That seat is mine.
- Which one?
- 13 and 14. I reserved them both.
Good for you.
What do you want with two seats?
What's that got to do with you?
It's OK, Abi. Let's go to the back.
We'll find you a seat. Come on.
Why don't I just get out
if I'm making so much trouble?
What is this, dragging me round
all over the place?!
OK, Abi. Move on towards the back.
Abi! Come down here!
Right. Sit over there.
Ramiz Abi?
Hüseyin? Wow! That's my boy!
Welcome, Hüseyin.
I've been expecting you so long!
What are you up to, Abi? Are you OK?
I'm fine, kid. You know.
I'm getting by with needle and thread.
Hey, I'm so glad you came!
So am I, Abi.
I've missed you.
Have a seat.
Now wait, how many years has it been?
1991, 2001, 2009. 18 years!
Easy to say. Look how time's flown.
How was the trip?
Anyway there's a shuttle service
to this neighbourhood, Ramiz Abi.
I just asked people along the way.
- Good! You want some tea, Hüseyin?
- Let me get it, Abi.
Get along with you!
Wow, Ramiz Abi. You haven't changed
a bit. You're just how I remember you.
I wish! I have grey hairs
coming out of my ass!
I look at you now, you know.
A whole lifetime's gone by.
I'm getting old. You were this big,
and now you're big as an ox. Amazing!
I'm going back to the time
I made your circumcision outfit.
Remember how you yelled
at the circumcision...
"They're chopping it off!
They're chopping it off!"
Well, they were!
How's the music?
Are you still playing?
Would I ever stop?
I'll play as long as I live.
Fantastic! How's Halil Agha?
And Hatice Abla? Let's hear!
Ramiz Abi, they're old, you know.
They bicker and bicker,
then they're friends again.
Good! Great!
So what's up? What's the big task
you mentioned on the phone, Hüseyin?
I'll tell you in a bit, Abi.
Look, Hüseyin. The shop's all yours.
I must get to the bank before it shuts.
There's an urgent bill to pay.
Let me do that and I'll be right back.
I'll go if you give me directions.
No, no. It needs my signature.
You just make yourself at home.
I'll be back in no time.
OK, Abi.
Hi there, honey!
Isn't Ramiz here?
Well, Ramiz Abi..
But that's not on!
I'll be late for the rehearsal.
Oh god, where's my dress?
Well, Ramiz Abi..
Ah, here. Let's see
if he's dropped the neckline.
Hold this up against me.
Hold it or it'll slip off.
No, not like that, boy!
Hold the bag.
Can you hold the sleeve as well?
I can't tell a thing like this.
I'm best off tying it on.
You wait there. Hey, bum fluff!
You're not peeking, are you?
How could you think that?!
Go for it, boy! Go for it!
Come on, boy!.. Go!
I just can't tell how it's turned out.
God! Does it make me look fat?
Huh? What the hell has he done
to the neck? Does he think I'm a nun?
I'm supposed to go on stage
in this dress!
You old fart, Ramiz!
How many times is this now?
I'm so wound up I could cry!
Plus I'm late for the rehearsal!
Now listen. Get the scissors
and cut open up the neck.
Come on, boy! I'm late.
But I...
You're opening this, not your mouth!
Cut it. Open it up, go on!
Oh god! Fuck!
What the hell have you done?
Oh no.
God damn you, bum fluff!
The dress is wrecked!
- Suppose we whack some glue on it?
- Here! I've done the whacking!
What was that about?!
What kind of helper are you?
You've fucked up the whole dress!
I'm not a helper. I'm looking after
the place. I'm a musician!
So, so, la, te, so,
fa, so, re, mi, fa, so, so...!
- I'm back, Abla!
- Where the hell were you, Ramiz?
The bank. I just had...
Don't give me the bank!
You were dropping off
betting coupons again, right?
Er, well.. No! What coupons?
Drop it! You think I don't know you?!
The superstar
also known as Ramiz the Horse!
They'll put up a statue of you
at the racecourse, you know?
- Ramiz the Horse?
- So you've made friends with our lad.
I was so blown away when he fucked up
the dress I thought I'd make friends.
- Yes.
- Don't open your mouth like that!
If it wasn't for my love..
If my heart wasn't so on fire..
Who'd call you..
Who'd call..
Come on!
There we go!
All on kanun!
- I'll be right there.
- Firuz.. Firuz..
Psycho! Didn't I tell you
not to come here? Huh?
I can't do it, Firuz. I can't do it.
What can't you do?
How many times have I told you
it's over?! Don't you get it?
I'll kill myself then, Firuz!
Go ahead! Do what the fuck you like.
Now get out of here! Go on!
Firuz, listen. They asked Hayyam
if he wanted a palace or a mansion.
He said what would he do with either
if there was no lover making inside?
Hayyam said that, did he?
It's Muazzez Abad who sings that!
Get out of here! Now!
Or I'll have you beaten up!
Look, Firuz. Just hold on..
Where the hell were you, Metin? Huh?
How come he got in, Metin?
The guys on the door dozed off, Firuz.
You're goddamn unbelievable!
But you doze off too, Manager Metin!
You do too! Let me tell you!
Firuz, I'm checking the numbers.
You want us to make no money tonight?
- Firuz!..
- Ah, sorry! Take him away. Creep!
- What are you saying?
- Really, it's like that, Ramiz Abi.
It turns out my dad didn't die
before I was born. He was alive.
Good god!
Yes. It hit me like a ton of bricks.
What kind of surprise is that?
Relax, Hüseyin. Relax.
We'll find your dad somehow,
dead or alive. Don't you worry.
Look at this, Ramiz Abi.
I have a photo of him.
Here. And his address is on the back.
Let's have a look.
Elmadag. OK.
We'll check it out tomorrow.
Abi, there's really no need.
I can find the place myself.
Out of the question!
Abi, I can't go messing up your work.
Don't make me feel bad, please!
If I can't manage by myself,
you can help me out.
- Hey, come on. Come here.
- It's me who's going.
- Get it down you.
- God damn you! Psycho!
Son, let me come with you. The place
is full of assholes. This is Istanbul!
No need for that, Ramiz Abi.
I don't want to mess up your work.
All right, Hüseyin. Remember.
Take the 71T from over there.
And get out at Taksim.
Coming back, take the shared taxi to
Baklrköy from Talimhane. It's easier.
- OK, Abi. Have a good day.
- Hey, wait! Have you got any money?
- Yes.
- OK. Have a good day then.
You too.
Morning, Firuzan.
Morning, horse whisperer.
- Hello, Ramiz Bey.
- Hello, Metin.
- Where's the boy going?
- Off to do some detective work.
Are the costumes ready?
I'll be picking them up tomorrow.
They'll be ready, Metin. Don't worry.
OK. Let's go.
We're running late, Metin.
Hey, are you rubbing against me?
You've been following me round
like a duckling all this time!
I'll snap it off and stuff it in
your pocket! Move away! Move!
This is the place.
Is there nobody around?
Ah, have they moved?
Arnavutköy.
Number 35.
Is there no caretaker or anyone?
Let me ask over there.
Whoa!.. Whoa!..
Who's there?
Hello. I pressed
the caretaker's bell but..
Why are you pressing bells
if you don't know whose they are?
Sorry, Abi.
Is that building next door empty?
Yes, right. It's empty.
Abi, sorry. I want to ask something.
Which flat is the caretaker's?
There's no caretaker in this building!
So who looks after the building?
None of your fucking business!
Don't fear, friend. It's shameful.
Don't give me shame!
You're making me yell at this hour!
So don't shout then. It's your fault.
What are you yelling about?
- You pressed my goddamn bell!
- So? Am I pressing you?!
Just wait there. I'm coming out!
Go ahead. What do I care?
You move in right by the entrance
and kick up a stink at the same time!
If you're that bothered,
stuff some paper in your ears!
Son, the man's crazy. Run for it!
- He's crazy?
- Yes, crazy! Run for it, son. Run!
See the old man selling lighters there?
He knows the whole area.
He's been around here longest.
Go and ask him.
This one's crazy. Run!
You don't mess with crazies.
I'll be off then.
Hello, old man! I hear you know everyone
in this neighbourhood.
I'm looking for a guy but..
Let's see if you know him.
- Who's this?
- My dad. Ali Rýza Seker.
- This is Ali Rýza Seker!
- Right! It's Ali Rýza Seker!
- He's a musician.
- Yes! He plays the saxophone.
- He plays the saxophone!
- Where is he now?
- Where is he now?
- I heard he lives here.
He used to live here.
Well, everyone's moved out.
They've emptied the building.
The building's empty.
A gas bottle exploded in the building.
Kemal died, the girl's arm blew off.
What?
This bit blew off and landed
all the way down at the greengrocer!
- My dad?
- Who's your dad?
You know, Ali Riza.
Huh, Ali Riza.
He got paid 2000 lira.
Look! She's had kittens.
Come here, pussy, pussy, pussy!
My god!.. God!
Ow! That really hurts!
The nail's ingrown, Abla.
I saw. It's terrible.
Please, Ayten. Be a bit careful!
- Abla, your Fatih is here.
- Firuzan!
Don't call him "my Fatih"!
Firuzan! I know you're in there!
I've seen you, petal!
- Leave that.
- Come out and let's talk, Firuzan!
Firuzan, for god's sake keep cool.
He'll go in a minute.
Firuzan!
But I've had it with him, Meto.
And last night he was peeping on me.
A lover will do anything!
Anything!
- Ah! Should we call the police?
- Don't fire me up, Meto.
Firuz!..
Who's going to love you now?
Who's going to be your panther
when you're fondling and making love?
- Whoa! That's it!
- Firuzan!
- Firuz!
- Fucking son of a bitch!
- Firuz!
- Come here, my love. Forgive me!
What do you want from me?
Firuz, don't kill your panther.
Forgive me, Firuz!
Fuck your panther!
- Firuzan! Firuzan!
- Firuzan Abla, don't!
Don't tear the guy to pieces!
Don't let it get to you, Hüseyin.
Tomorrow is another day.
Go again and have another look!
Thanks, Ramiz Abi.
Good night.
OK, good night.
I'm going to bed.
Don't say they're closed again!
- Selam aleykum, Abi!
- Aleykum selam!
Abi, when do you think
this place will be open?
Roza Hanim went off to Bodrum.
She'll probably be gone for a week.
A week?
That's generally what happens.
She has another shop there.
Oh my god! What am I going to do
in Istanbul for a whole week?
Don't let it get to you, Hüseyin.
Let's just see.
Yes, Metin?
Hello, Ramiz Bey.
I'm going to be tied up for a while.
Can you get the costumes to Firuzan?
Where is she?
OK. I'll send them right away, Metin.
Have a good day.
Thank you. Goodbye!
OK, Metin. Switch the phone to silent.
We're starting the class. Quick!
Coming, teacher!
OK, we'll start with basic.
To the side. Give it more energy!
Ah, Hüseyin!
Have you got my dresses?
Hey, thanks.
It's been one thing after another.
Everything's gone wrong today.
It's my first magazine interview
and Metin dear is nowhere to be found.
Can you imagine?
I mean, I'm about to lose it.
It's a concept shoot what's more!
Yes.
Hey, Hüseyin..
Are you free today?
I have nothing planned.
I was just sitting in the shop.
- Give me some service today, will you?
- Give you what?
No, I don't mean like that.
Will you help me out today?
I mean, will you help me
with the shoot here?
Sure, if I can, Abla.
That's my boy! You're a hero!
Now take these. Hang them up
so they don't get creased.
Ah! I'm so nervous, you know.
I'm starving! It's nerves, stress.
Let's get something to eat.
Sit down there. Let's chill out.
We'll stuff ourselves
and then get to work.
Put those there so they don't crease.
Can you come over, honey?
Yes?
Let's not mess around with menus.
What can we get that's fast?
Our specials...
That's kind of too much.
Let's not get into those.
We want something more..
Something more like a snack.
OK. In that case, you could have
buga beys, black risotto calamare...
or filet mignon.
Hah! Look, fi..
Filet mignon is fine but..
The thing is, I don't eat chicken.
But filet mignon is
made with red meat, madam.
It was with chicken in Düsseldom.
Whatever. So you do it different..
You said risotto, didn't you?
Yes, black risotto de la calamare.
De la.. OK. Calamare means
it has calamari in it?
Good, we'll have that then.
Two of those.
OK. What will you have to drink?
- Water.
- Water. OK.
OK. Thanks.
You like calamari, don't you, Hüseyin?
I'm from Çanakkale.
We snack on calamari the whole time.
Ah, that sounds good!
All crisp and crunchy.
Well, there we go.
Let's see what it's like here.
- What's this?
- Black risotto with calamari.
- Where's the calamari?
- In there somewhere.
Did a truck run over it or something?
What is this?
- It tastes good actually.
- Abla, what's the black stuff?
- Well..The calamari ink, I suppose.
- Do we eat that?
Er, yes.
The animal squirts that stuff
when it's running away shitless!
Go on, get it down you!
Hello there, guys!
Hello, Firuzan Hanim.
Hello.
Sorry, I'm late. Istanbul traffic..
You know what it's like.
Yes.
How about we do the interview first?
Then we'll move on to the shoot.
- Sure. It was Jale, right?
- Yes.
Welcome! Hüseyin, can you slide over...
and make some room for Jale Hanim?
Think of night club acts in Istanbul
and you're first to come to mind.
You haven't done an
album yet either, but
you get far more work than artists...
who have released albums.
What would you say the secret is?
Er, well, you know
Sezen Aksu is a Cancer too.
We're emotional people,
full of emotion, feeling, completely...
And of course being natural,
that's very important.
That gets across to the audience.
I go for popular songs
in my repertoire on the whole.
I'm good on stage, I mean.
Yes, so they say.
Well, the album will hopefully
be making a big splash very soon.
I got some songs off Yýldýz.
There are my own songs. And so on.
So did you also write the lyrics?
Yes, I wrote some of the lyrics.
I've found a new beau..
More faithful than you..
We walk down by the Bosphorus..
My new man's so different..
He doesn't hurt me like you..
His car's clad in leather..
He doesn't leave me all the time..
Ah! This man's so different..
Then it's the thing.
Dreamy, dreamy, dreamy, dreamy..
My man's so different..
We'll mary this summer..
The fortune tellers are so right..
This bit's better.
Dreamy, dreamy, dreamy, dreamy..
My man's so different..
We're off to the Maldives on honeymoon..
The headlines are so right..
That's a reference to you,
the "headlines" bit.
Whenever we interview artists
for Oloskop magazine...
we also interview their crew.
I mean, if that's OK of course..
- Ah, of course, sure, go ahead.
- Firuzan's favourite thing?
Black calamari!
- Something that makes her crazy?
- Her dress getting ripped.
If you had to describe Firuzan
in one sentence, what would it be?
Well, her bad side sucks.
But she's a good person actually.
OK.. Let's do the shoot then.
Sure.
Let's have the fan.. The fan!
One second, one second.
Could we have kind of
a more feminine Cancer lady.
Fantastic! A bit sexier.
And again.
What are you doing?
- She's meating! I'm wiping it off.
- OK. Now if you don't mind..
- OK.
- OK. Right. Let's cary on.
Keep it up! Nice.
That's it, fantastic!
I'm onto the low angles now.
Let's see those teeth.
Yes.. Yes..
What are you doing?
It'll help her nerves.
If she has a glass, she'll unwind!
If you don't mind,
let's just do the shoot!
Right, because it's wrecking
my concentration right now.
Turn it on, kid! That's it!
More female. Move. More feminine.
Firuzan Abla, don't you want
the bull's tail? Shall I bring it?
I don't know. If they want it..
- No, no. We don't need it.
- In that case, OK. I'm ready.
Yes, nice.
It's crap!
Bulls aren't like that.
You don't get bulls like that!
When did bulls ever do that?
Move in front of a bull that's tied up
and it'll break loose and kill you!
Hüseyin, OK. I can't concentrate.
OK, Hüseyin.
OK, let's turn to the side now.
Yes, let's have a wilder look.
Yes. And again, OK? Yes.
For god's sake!
Yes!
You're having her turn to the side
and open her mouth? No bull does that!
It's a big game for you, Flash Ali!
I mean, what kind of bull is that?
A bull that opens its mouth like that?
Is it drinking from the trough?
What's it supposed to be doing?
It's nothing like the real thing.
Damn it! Look, here..
Just shut up!
You're shaming the woman!
You make her meat for hours.
The crab was crap too.
All because of you. Your rush things.
You don't get crabs like that!
Abla, I'm saying it for your own good!
What's with a crab
like a foot soldier?
Crabs buy their asses in the sand.
Move above them...
and they go like this.
They zoom away backwards
and buy themselves. It's all wrong.
Because of you.
You rush things.
She's a bull, huh? A bull that turns
to the side and opens its mouth?!
You're shooting a goddamn porn movie
with your bull!
Listen, bum fluff.
I'm out of patience, OK?
Get back to your place
and don't make me crazy here!
That's it!
Fabulous!
Enough lions and tigers.
It'll never end. Enough!
Look, the woman's soaked in meat!
- Enough! She'll get mine flu!
- OK, OK. We're done anyway.
I'm really sorry. I'm a bit late.
Where have you been, Metin?
Where have you been?
I cleared up the money we're owed.
It's all stories!
What do you ever clear up?
We're half-dead here!
She's been every animal under the sun!
The woman's been crawling around
on the floor. Take us home!
Hüseyin, you've become
like an Istanbul native, you know!
I send you off in one piece
and you come back all bust up!
I've shamed myself.
- Drink this!
- I'll throw up if I do, Ramiz Abi.
Drink it or I'll throw one your way.
Whenever I drink fucking whisky
it ends up like this.
That photographer pissed me off.
That's why I got drunk.
Otherwise I'd have been fine.
Drink up!
It's a dead-end, Ramiz Abi.
It's been a week.
I've been everywhere. To the police,
the local council, the registry office.
There's no sign of the guy.
I'm just bashing my head
against a brick wall.
I'm just left with the silver shop.
Hopefully I'll get to check that out.
Suppose we print some fliers?
But the photo's so old, Abi.
I thought of putting a notice
in the paper, but the photo's too old.
Sorry, but I don't have a penny left!
I'm here, son.
Drop it, Ramiz Abi!
I've bothered you enough already.
Don't talk like that,
or I'll do your head in!
I wiped your ass as a baby, damn it!
I almost count as your father.
I wish you were my father, Abi.
You're such a decent guy.
- Take this, go on.
- No chance.
Take it.
- I'm off to the bank.
- What, again?
Hüseyin?
- Hello, Abla.
- You play amazingly.
Thanks. I just tinker around.
What do you mean, kid?
You're a real expert.
Well, I've been at it
since I was small, of course.
God! You've blown my mind
at this hour of morning, bum fluff!
Since I was a kid I've picked this up
whenever things get me down.
So things are really
getting you down right now!
They are, Abla.
You see, Firuzan Abla,
I'd just got used to being alone...
and they said I had a father.
So I came all the way here.
I've been a bother to everyone.
I've messed up Ramiz Abi's routine.
There were other things
happening back home.
- So what's her name?
- Müjgan.
Hey, even saying her name
your eyes light up, bum fluff!
I'd say you're in love.
Yes.
- Selam aleykum!
- Hello.
- Thank goodness!
- Sorry.
No, the face isn't familiar.
But the letters show this address.
OK, but that was 30 years ago.
We were there for eight years.
Yes..
What do you think I should do now?
Have you looked on the internet?
Have you checked the internet?
Ah! Why didn't I think of that?
You're right. I've never looked.
There's an internet café
just round the back there.
OK. I'll go and check then.
Thanks a lot for the trouble.
- Not at all. Good luck.
- Goodbye.
This ring?
- It's turquoise. Beautiful, isn't it?
- Beautiful.
It's just like the sea back home.
The same colour.
- How much is it?
- I'll let you have it for 275 lira.
If I paid a deposit,
could you keep it for a few days?
- Sure. But I don't need a deposit.
- Really?
All right, goodbye.
What kind of smart ass computer
is this?!
"Did you mean this?
Did you mean that?"
Yes, that's what I meant!
Hello, Metin? I was in the shower.
I couldn't answer. What's up?
How can he quit?
We're on stage tonight!
What? I don't get it.
Are you off your head?
Look, I've gone without pay myself
just so he gets his. Ungrateful shit!
It's not on, Metin!
Do what you like. I don't know.
Metin! I'm not doing my number
at Zarifi with three sax players...
so people can laugh at me. OK?
Please! Get this sorted.
Well, OK. Wasn't ibo supposed to
come and play for one night?
How come? No, I'm not having it!
No, I..
OK. OK, get this sorted.
Hah! Wait! Are the posters
and everything all set?
OK, OK, OK.
All right, bye.
Ooph! All I get is crap
the whole time.
Hello? Who's that?
Metin? Metin who?
Firuzan's manager Metin?
Hah! OK. What are you up to?
Tonight? Look, I'm
not really in the mood.
There's a family issue. Personal.
Yes. Yes.. 250 lira?
Well, what can I do?
I'll come and play then.
All love affairs are lies anyway..
They always end in grief..
- We're off-key now.
- Because of you!
- What?
- Because of you!
Hey, you only just arrived!
Are you tying to show off here?
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.
What are you saying, Hüseyin?
Abla, sing the song in this key
and god help us!
He's making you sing in a key
that works for Sertab.
You're not a soprano!
You're an alto. I've worked you out.
In this key he'll have you yelling
all night like Tarzan of Manisa.
Play in A and let's see if she cracks.
Play in A and let's see if she cracks.
OK, do it. Go on.
Firuz! Firuz!
Haldun Eskiciler has turned up!
You're not serious!
What a night! I don't believe it.
It's giving me stomach cramps.
Come on. Why don't you get ready?
Right, OK.
Come on, you guys. Get going
and warm things up a bit.
Get going, guys.
Metin Abi, who's Haldun Eskiciler?
He owns Istanbul, meetie. A big shot.
- What happened to your voice?
- It's nerves. Come on!
You mean mafia or what?
With every breath draw me inside you
from head to toe and let me stay there..
With every breath draw me inside you
from head to toe and let me stay there..
All love affairs are lies anyway..
They always end in grief..
Even if loneliness is all
that's left behind, you're worth it..
Let's hear you!
All love affairs are lies anyway..
They always end in grief..
Even if loneliness is all
that's left behind, you're worth it..
Thanks! Thanks for the applause!
Bless you! Are we having a good time?
Cheers! Thanks! Thank you!
I saw, I saw, I saw.
Welcome to you. Welcome.
Haldun Bey has honoured us
with his presence here tonight.
Thank you very much.
And he's requested a song.
Thanks again. Let's just
check the key if that's OK with you.
I don't know this song.
- So what do we do?
- I have no idea about the lyrics.
- What's that?
- You know it?
I have the lyrics OK
but I need to write them down.
Forget that, kid. There's no time.
Come on! You know the song?
- I know the lyrics.
- Hey, what's your surname?
Badem.
We have a surprise for you now.
We are, of course, going to play
Haldun Beys request.
We're going to hear this song from
the famous vocalist and musician...
born and raised in Çanakkale,
from Hüseyin Badem!
Go ahead, maestro! We're listening!
Hüseyin Badem.. A round of applause!
First of all, I'd like...
to thank Firuzan Haným
for giving me this opportunity.
They say leaves won't fall
if God so wills..
They say man won't die
if God so wills..
They say leaves won't fall
if God so wills..
They say man won't die
if God so wills..
Are you God?
For you've killed me..
You've made friends and family
laugh at me..
Are you God?
For you've killed me..
You've made friends and family
laugh at me..
Listen to your conscience..
What is it telling you..
This heart is dying for you..
Listen to your conscience..
What is it telling you..
This heart is dying for you..
Chin chin, Haldun Abi!
God, bum fluff! You have a death wish?
How could you call the guy Haldun Abi?
- So what should I say?
- What do you mean?
He's not your mate from the army!
You've really fucked up here!
Abla, look. If I spoke to the man
face to face, I'd keep my distance.
But on stage that kind of thing is OK.
I mean, please!
Ah! You dickhead!
You goddamn dickhead!
- Firuz, Firuz!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- This is from Haldun Bey.
- Thanks. Thank you.
- After you.
It's for you.
For me?
'From a Samatyan to the Çanakkalean..
Have a good time spending, my man ?
The guys sent me money.
Now I should share
this with the band, right?
Look, Abla. I'd have taken a taxi.
God, champ!
Ramiz lives a street up from me.
We said we'd drop you off!
For god's sake!
You earn a couple of bucks
and get ants in your pants!
It's because of circulation, you know?
You know,
your ass itches sometimes...
- ...or your hand or whatever?
- So?
It's your capillaries that do it.
When the blood suddenly bursts
into the veins it makes you itch.
Hah!
Ah! Birds do that thing, right?
When they peck their wings..
- Is that the capillaries too?
- No. It's because they need to.
You're off your head, bum fluff.
Seriously! I love crazies!
Hey, that was a good one!
What's going on, Hüseyin?
He's not answering, Abla.
You go and I'll find a hotel.
Well, ring the doorbell!
There are no names. I can't
wake people at this time of night.
Look, kid. Wasn't his place
one down from the top floor?
There's two flats on each floor.
How do you know which one is his?
It's like Russian roulette.
I'm all stressed out, you know!
Champ, don't you know anyone
in the building?
- No.
- OK, then. Hop in.
- Hop in where?
- To me!
- God damn you!
- You're still gawking. Get in, kid!
- Should I come?
- Come on! For god's sake, at this time!
OK, Metin. See you. Bye!
Here you go, bum fluff.
Put these on. Hopefully they'll fit.
- Thanks for the trouble, Firuzan Abla.
- OK, good night.
- Firuzan Abla!
- Huh?
Why are there all these toys
and dolls and stuff everywhere?
I don't know. I've collected them
since I was a kid. Look at her!
- What's up? It freaks you out?
- No. I'm just surprised.
You know some people
are scared of rag dolls, right?
They think they'll come to life
at night or whenever.
I mean, they lump them together
with witchcraft and stuff. You see?
- Yes.
- Don't be scared!
Agh! What the hell are you doing?
God, you're a grown-up man
and look how scared you were!
OK. OK, good night.
Hey, listen.
There are stories like that, you know.
You know about tin soldiers, right?
Wasn't it Kenan Dogulu who sang that?
Oh god, bum fluff!
Go on, go to bed. Go on!
Hüseyin! Hüseyin, get up!
In the name of God..
What's going on, Abla?
- Hüseyin, Fatih's here.
- Who's Fatih?
To hell with that for now.
Just hide somewhere.
He's yelling his head off, psycho!
Where am I supposed to hide?
What the hell do you want?
- Get out of my house! It's the..
- Why the hell don't you let me in?
You can't come in at this time
or shame me in front of the neighbours!
Out of the way!
Look, the neighbours
will call the police again!
- Fatih!
- Where's that son of a bitch?
Where's what?
- God damn you!
- Are you bringing men home?
I'm not bringing anyone home!
God damn you, Fatih!
Come here! Come here, I said!
Where the hell are you?
There's no one here!
Oh my god!
Who the fuck are you?
And wearing my meat suit!
I'll take it off, Abi.
I'll fucking strangle you!
Don't! Don't do it! Fatih!
You'll kill the guy! Fatih!
Don't! You'll kill him!
Don't you know who I am?!
Dickhead!
He won't die, will he?
No. Nothing ever happens to him.
Let me call Metin. He can come
and get this animal out of here.
Or else we can stick him
outside the apartment entrance.
He'll come round in time
with the fresh air.
OK. Let's do it.
Agh! Fuck that bear or elephant
or whatever! I'm sorry, Abla.
Anyway, thank god it's over now.
Worse things could have happened, son.
The guy was strangling me.
Look. My neck's all bruised.
OK, just shut it, Hüseyin!
These buns are sticking
in my throat as it is.
My conscience is killing me.
It's all my fault.
How can it be your fault, huh?
I'm just off to the bank.
Look, if you get it right,
I'm partners with you this time!
So he must have really loved you.
What?
I'm talking about your man.
Considering he tried to strangle me,
he must have really loved you.
Aha. He loved me. That's why he went
and screwed my vocalist, right?
That's out of order. And with someone
at work, that's totally wrong.
Don't push it, OK?
Anyway, still looking for your dad?
Yes.
If we went on a morning TV show,
we'd find him in a day, you know.
On TV?
No. I'd make an ass of myself.
Standing there like Pinocchio.
I could never go back to Çanakkale.
Well, how about an ad in the paper?
It's kind of expensive.
I mean maybe later.
Let me check those addresses
I found on the internet today.
OK. I'm coming with you.
You really don't have to.
Are you crazy?
I feel guilty as hell anyway.
At least let me do you a favour.
Thanks, Abla.
This is one of the addresses
off the internet.
Seker Cheeses.. Ali Rýza Seker.
Hey! Look!
He looks like me!
You don't think he's your brother?
I'd say you've found your dad finally.
- Oh my god!
- Come on, let's go.
Wait, Abla. Wait!
I'm not ready for this.
What do I need with a brother now?
Knock it off! Come on, let's go.
Selam aleykum!
What did you want?
- You have any Ezine cheese?
- The top notch!
- You like it?
- Love it. Give it a ty, brother.
Brother?
Hmm, nice.
How much do you want?
Weigh us out a kilo.
Go on, ask!
Friend..
We want to ask you something.
We're looking for someone
called Ali Rýza Seker.
- Huh.. My dad's gone to the mosque.
- Your dad?
Yes, my dad. I'm Fuat Seker. What's up?
Does your dad play sax?
- What?
- Your dad.. Does he play sax?
Play sex? Hey, watch your mouth!
What? I'm asking if he plays sax!
Hey, you're asking for trouble, git!
OK, friend. OK.
Look, you've got the wrong idea.
We're looking for someone
called Ali Rýza Seker, OK?
The man's a musician.
He plays the saxophone.
Get out the photo of him, come on!
That's him. The one in the middle.
That's not my dad. We're farmers.
My dad's a hadji too. That's him there.
Pissing me off at this time of day!
What's pissing you off, sicko?
It's your fault. You look like me.
You're nothing like your dad.
It's your fault. Your cheese sucks
as well! We're not buying it!
The goat's cheese my gran makes
would have you licking your fingers.
OK, let's go.
God, Hüseyin. There's a side to you
that just beckons trouble, I tell you.
What have I done now, Abla?
How could you ask the guy like that?!
"Does your dad play sax?"
He got the wrong idea.
What can I do?
Dear God.
My dad played the saxophone.
How am I supposed to say that?
I'm down in any case. I thought
I'd found him. And that feels so bad.
Come on, let's go.
We'll put an ad in the paper.
Then go back home and wait to hear.
No. Let me check this last address
or I'll only regret it later.
Agh! You and your regrets!
OK, OK. Don't make faces.
It's OK. We'll go.
Hey, can you come over?
Let's get the bill.
- No, please. It's OK.
- Whatever..
They're off their heads.
How could a toasted sandwich
and two teas come to 26.50 lira?
I could get a goat slaughtered
for that price back in Geyikli!
This is Istanbul, kid.
With another 500 lira you
could get a man slaughtered here.
- Go on, pay.
- Come here!
This is it. Look, Seker Emlak.
Look, Hüseyin. If this is a failure
we'll put an ad in the paper, OK?
- OK, Abla.
- Come on, let's go then.
Now look, Ali Rýza Seker! Didn't we
tell you we were buying that land?
I fear, Abi! I didn't sell it.
It's got nothing to do with me!
Shut up! Tying to screw me,
are you, asshole?
I didn't sell it, I fear, Abi!
We'll find you land somewhere else.
Another bit of land, huh?
Take your fucking land!
Er, we're looking for..
A place to rent.. without stairs.
They said this real estate agent
had some places.
The thing is, we can't see.
Is this the real estate agent?
Yes. We can't see anything.
We have problems.
We need a garden-floor flat.
They told us you had some here.
We have a dog.
People always complain.
Do you have a garden-floor flat for us?
No. The owner's not here.
Come back later.
When should we come back?
What time?
Look, we have real problems
getting up here with the stairs.
OK, don't push it now, brother.
We'll come back later.
But when?
We'll work it out. Goodbye!
Come on. Where was the door?
Hah! Here. Come on.
Why the fuck are you looking back?
- Hey, they can see!
- Oh my god!
- Abi, where are you going?
- To the coach station.
- What?
- The thing's a dead-end.
I'm best off going back to Geyikli.
You fucking asshole!
You've just landed me in the shit!
Where do you think you're going?
What is this? Psychos!
It's your fault! You said you wanted to
come! I didn't ask you! You just came!
- Abla, cut it out!
- Shut up, shithead!
Abla, what are you doing? Cool it!
- Keep your nose out! What's it to you?
- Right!
I told you it was no way to find him.
There. We finally found your dad.
No, that isn't my dad.
He's too young.
Agh! God give me patience!
Hey, don't start again
or I'll kick you both out!
Shut up for god's sake!
Shut up yourself, head case!
Who are you calling head case, huh?
- Abi, stop!
- Who are you calling head case?
- Abi, stop! Abi!
- Who are you calling head case?
God damn it!
Get out, get out.
Come here.
God! The car's a write-off!
Better the car than..
Shut up! Goddamn psychos!
Why did you have to pick me
in the whole of Istanbul?
- Are you OK, friend?
- My neck isn't good.
Your neck?
I know about necks.
- What are you doing?
- Wait.
- Does that hurt?
- Yes!
- Huh. Wait... Now?
- Agh! Yes!
- How about now?
- Yes!
OK, now loosen up.
- How's that now?
- Better.
He's fine. He just slipped a neck disc.
I put it back.
Abla, you have a break too.
I guess I've lost my tooth.
Look, it's broken.
Not your tooth. Your finger's broken.
No, my finger's fine. It's my tooth.
No, look. It's broken here.
- Agh! What did you do?!
- The second joint's gone.
Your head's bleeding too.
My neck's better,
but now I can't feel my arms.
You know what the number is
for ambulances in Istanbul?
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
There's nothing to worry about.
Just strain from the impact.
It seemed like a slipped disc to me.
Just shut up, will you!
Anyway, hope you feel better soon.
Thanks. Sorry, friend.
We've given you grief.
Just look at the state of you.
Wait, I have some with me..
But I just don't know how much.
Hah! Here take this..
Ty and make do with that.
And here, I'll write down
my number for you.
Could I borrow a pen, nurse?
Thanks. Look,
I'm writing it here. OK?
And my manager
will get your car fixed.
I called him just now
but couldn't get hold of him.
Here, friend.
Thanks.
What's done is done.
Get a muscle relaxant. It'll help.
But don't take it with alcohol.
Please! Keep him away from me.
That's all I ask.
Well, don't you like an easy time!
Think about the painter!
The guy didn't make it to hospital.
He's left stuck on the job.
Enough! OK, Hüseyin. OK.
Let's be going too.
- Jerk!
- Come on, get going!
You gave him too much.
You overpaid him.
Look, the man's car was trashed.
Come on!
Ramiz Bey.
- Do you have insurance, bum fluff?
- No, fat chance.
They don't it for people over 120 kg.
Excuse me! Can you help?
The bed in the room's broken.
It won't go up.
I've said so 50 times already today.
Which room was it, madam?
106. Ali Rýza Seker.
Ali Rýza Seker.
I'll check right now.
OK. We'll change the bed right away.
I'm terribly sorry.
He's being discharged tomorrow anyway.
Yes.. Thanks.
Did you hear that, Abla?
She said Ali Rýza Seker!
Third time lucky, Hüseyin!
If we get in trouble this time,
we're in hospital anyway. Get going!
Just hold on, Ramiz Abi.
Give it a break!
Your kid isn't answering.
It looks like him, you know.
Yes.
Hello?
- Get well soon.
- Thanks, son.
- Get well soon.
- Thanks. That's nice of you.
Er, excuse me. My name's Hüseyin.
And this is my friend, Firuzan Haným.
We were looking for
someone called Ali Rýza Seker.
- Is that you?
- Yes.
Yes.
Sorry, we've disturbed you.
Is that you in the photo
by any chance?
This is so old!
Where did you find it?
Are you Fethi's son?
Fethi the drummer?
No.
Was it you who wrote these letters?
They were left by my mother.
Are you Ayse's son?
Yes.
You said "left". Did something happen
to Ayse? She hasn't died, has she?
I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry to hear that, son.
There, that's life.
So you're Ayse's son, huh?
I'm your son as well.
What?
I'm your son too.
You're my son?
Yes.
When mum gave up hope of you
she was pregnant with me.
She hid it from you.
My grandparents knew too
but they hid it as well.
I found them rummaging in the cupboard.
Then I came all the way here.
Mum never married.
They always told me as a child
that my dad died before I was born.
Are you OK?
He's having a turn.
Give him some water!
Are you OK?
I'm fine, son.. I'm fine.
Did you never wonder about mum?
Are you crazy?
When I met you mother
I had a fiancée in Istanbul.
We were in Lapseki to play music.
One night.. I saw your mother from
the stage. I was captivated on the spot.
My engagement went out of the window.
I'd fallen in love.
The owner of the music hall
where we were working, a woman...
she sent your mother a message
saying I had a fiancée in Istanbul.
She didn't even give me
the chance to explain.
I expect they'd been gossip too.
She never forgave me.
She was right. I wrote these letters.
I had other people intervene.
But it was useless. I
ended my engagement
too but she wouldn't listen to me.
After a while
the letters started coming back.
And I lost all trace of her.
Three or four years later...
a musician friend told me
he'd seen her in Ezine.
I went and saw my beloved
in the market place.
She was carrying a small child.
I imagined she was married.
The kid was fat of course.
That was me.
I've never married either.
So who was the woman outside?
Oh, her? Sükran Hanim.
My neighbour.
My foul-weather friend.
Hüseyin, you have your mother's face.
And my build.
I have music too. I play the clarinet.
Wonderful.
Can I call you dad?
Of course you can, son. Of course!
Oh god! Oh god!
Dad.. If it wasn't for Firuzan Haným,
I'd never have found you, you know.
No, come on.
All this is fated, son.
It's in our destiny.
I've never had any family myself
until now.
I thank the Lord.
How did we lose Ayse?
In an accident.
A car accident?
No. The mule trampled her.
The animal got a thorn in its hoof.
She was tying to get it out.
The animal suddenly laid into her.
I saw mum flying through the air.
God forbid.
It's Ramiz Abi. I know it's rude
but I'll be right back.
Well, life is full of surprises, huh?
We should always be thankful.
It's as if the sun has come out
on a bleak winter's day.
Let me check on Hüseyin.
We'll be back in a minute.
OK.
What's up?
The guys have tracked us down.
They've got Ramiz Abi.
They say if we don't go
they'll kill him.
But if we go, they'll kill us all!
I said I'd go on my own but
they said they wanted you too.
You know the Golden Horn Bridge?
We have to be under it in an hour.
They said if we told the police,
they'd cut Ramiz Abi's throat.
What are we going to do?
Wait, I'm thinking.
Let's call Metin.
You think Metin's going to save us?
You have a better idea?
Maybe he'll bring along some guys
on the quiet. How do I know?!
You're right. Don't let's go
like sheep to the slaughter at least.
Just a second, Abla.
Where are you, Metin?
You only just got here, son.
Where are you going?
It's important, dad.
A friend's in trouble. He needs me.
Is the phone yours?
Look, I've recorded my number here.
OK? Call me if anything happens.
You're being discharged tomorrow, huh?
- Yes.
- I'll be here for sure.
- OK.
- Well, take good care.
Why isn't he answering, damn it?
It keeps going to the answer phone.
Leave a message, Abla.
We have 20 minutes.
Ramiz Abi, this stuff is quicklime.
It'll even eat our bones.
Like a mass grave!
Hüseyin, they're going to kill us!
Hüseyin!
OK, guys. That'll do. Step aside.
Abi, I fear to god
we won't tell anyone!
Why do you need to kill us, Abi?
Ah, Hüseyin! Ah! Ah!
Please don't kill us! Please!
Was it me who told you
to go the real estate agent? Huh?
Abi, we didn't mean to go there.
It was fate, I fear!
I was looking for my dad.
We didn't mean to go there.
And I was tying to help him.
Please don't kill us!
Promise we won't tell anyone!
Here we go then.
Ramiz Abi, I'm sorry, Abi.
Firuzan Abla, I feel terrible.
I'm sorry.
Pray for me, gran!
Stop right there!
What's going on?
Fatih!
Your Fatih's here!
Your Fatih's here
with five other guys! Five!
Come on, Hüseyin!
Run, run, run! Come on!
Fatih?
Let's take Fatih with us!
He knows what he's doing.
He'll sort himself out. Now run!
Ramiz Abi..
We found dad, you know?
Agh! Fuck your dad!
Get moving!
Move!
Give yourselves up!
- Fine.
- Are you OK?
Morning, dad!
Morning!
Where were you, son?
I called you all night. No answer.
Don't ask, pops.
The phone was nabbed.
We nearly had our lives nabbed too!
What's the matter?
We were at the police station all night.
Thank goodness we're here now.
You have your ID with you?
I'm going to take you somewhere.
Where?
To a place
where it's always summer, dad.
We're going to Geyikli,
to my village. Come on.
- I'm not coming, son.
- Where aren't you coming?
How can I look your grandparents
in the face? You stay here with me.
No, dad! They're not like that.
Come with me. Listen to me.
It'll be good for your health, too.
People live a long time there.
The average age is 65.
I'm 63.
I mean generally speaking.
Of course god has a hand in it too.
Come on, boys!
Don't let's hang around!
The train's leaving!
Get a move on!
Come on.
Thank goodness! We're going back.
Hey, why am I coming, bum fluff?
Well, Abla. You can go in the sea.
Have a holiday.
Now's the bonito season!
- Good timing!
- Yes!
And I'll get to see my mum.
I need a change of scene!
Oh my god!
Stop, Abla! Stop, stop!
What's wrong, son?
What's wrong this time?
I had a ring put aside for Müjgan.
I forgot to pick it up. Let's go back!
Here, take this.
Give the girl this. Here.
We're not turning back
after all this way, or I'll kill you.
Abla, you're an amazing person,
you know. Take it from me.
It's gold as well! You still
have to ask for the girl's hand!
What?
You have to ask for the girl's hand.
You have to help me now.
We set out on this trip together!
Oh my god!
