"Date is partial to repetition, variation
and symmetry..." J.L. Borges, 'The Plot'.
The world is a huge great ball
with loads of cities on it.
Of all these cities
thI'me nicest one of all is Istanbul.
I'm sure of that
because I've never seen Istanbul.
ISTANBUL TALES
Now, when it comes to storytelling,
I have to tell you Hilmi Abi's tale.
Come with me.
Shhh! Hello! I'm here. Here!
This way...
We're in a concert right now.
I'm Erkan.
Erkan, the drum player.
We're doing a live broadcast
so I have to keep quiet.
Wait. Let Hilmi finish his improvisation.
Then I'll tell you that story.
Our hero is Hilmi Abi.
It's a tale of love, sex, betrayal,
revenge, every trick in the book...
But be patient.
You can't interrupt an improvisation.
You can't interrupt an improvisation
But my story is different...
Once upon a time,
one evening in Istanbul...
Two gunshots rang out
into the Istanbul heavens.
One of Istanbul's kings was dead.
That's how the story began.
Once upon a time, a prince charming
was hungry and homeless in Istanbul.
Once upon an evening,
my mother and I had just left prison.
One evening in Istanbul...
A legendary beauty
found the love of her life.
And who else is there?
Who else isn't there?
Sleeping beauties, princesses,
mean queens, fairy godmothers...
And, of course, the city's wolves...
Now, wait. Everyone in turn.
I said I'd tell you about our Hilmi
once he'd finished.
He's done now.
So let me begin, girls and boys...
We work at the radio station.
But we earn a pittance, of course.
So we end up working
all over the place.
That night, Hilmi and I had an extra
after the broadcast.
We set off for the neighbourhood.
Give me a couple of those, will you?
- How's the wife then?
- Dine.
Girls and boys, this is a tale of love.
Our Hilmi was head over heels
and there was no stopping him.
They say marriage is death to love,
but love struck Hilmi after his wedding.
- Hello, there.
- Hello.
What the helI's this?
- When was it taken?
- Yesterday.
What's it for this time?
- She's giving it to some casting agency.
- What agency?
A casting agency, Abi.
They turn people into actors there.
Bullshit!
That's my wife, damn it! Take it down!
You can't stick it there
for all the neighbours to see!
If I don't, she'll kill me.
Besides, it's a good one, right?
Hey, I'm getting my artistry talked about.
Don't deprive people. They should see it.
Then let them see her with her man.
You can't hang it there. Take it down.
- Hilmi Abi, you're making a mistake.
- Oh yeah? There's money in it, right?
Money, Abi? With your wife?
Are you crazy? We'll work something out.
Look, you don't take artist photos here!
Or else...
- I'm off home. You go. I'll join you.
- OK, Abi.
I'll give you your artistry, you'll see...
- Good night, Abi.
- Good night.
Senay...
You scared me to death!
How did you creep in like that?
Didn't you have an extra?
What are you doing here at home?
You've had that bastard Rifki
take your picture again, baby.
The guy's stuck it there
for all the world to see.
There's a casting agency in Beyoglu.
Suheyla signed up.
They called her the other day for an ad.
All she did was shout 'flower girI'.
She earned 150 million just like that.
So I thought I'd sign up too.
I thought I'd help with the housekeeping.
Then my man wouldn't drag himself off
to extras every night.
Then I'd have more of my man to myself.
Then he'd do his husbandly thing
and take me to paradise.
Was that such bad thinking?
Of course not. It's a good idea, but...
Having everyone see the thing...
You have to watch out...
What's up, baby? I'm all yours.
I came to you as your very own bride.
There's magic in this. Magic...
One blow and you had me on fire.
The tunes you played had me spellbound.
Suddenly I was in love. I was yours...
Come on, you lion of a husband.
Don't be late for work now.
The team will be waiting.
And drop this off at Rifki's. Dorget it.
Let him put it up. Let everyone see it.
And you be proud.
Show off to everyone. Go on now.
The prominent businessman, lhsan Karal,
was killed today in an armed assault...
At an Eminonu restaurant.
What's going on? I thought I was late.
Didn't the customers show up?
The attacker killed businessman Karal
with two gunshots to the chest.
I don't understand how it happened.
The guy burst in, shot Karal and left.
I didn't even see what he looked like.
Karal died at the scene of the incident.
- What's this?
- Lhsan Bey. He's dead. Down death alley...
Duck!
We're expecting the guy in this world
and he goes and clears off to the next.
Ooph! He was our best customer.
I mean, he booked us once a month.
What's that, Hilmi Abi?
Taking the wife out on the town?
Shut up! Don't make matters worse.
Hey, Naciye!
How about a raki before we go?
- I'm all cut up about lhsan Bey.
- OK, love.
I had no idea that night was
the last time I'd see Hilmi Abi.
Hilmi Abi? Hilmi Abi? The job?
Cancelled. The guy died this evening.
- Abi, wait. Let me explain...
- Explain what?
- You can't explain love.
- We love each other, Abi.
I'll marry her if I have to.
I'll marry her!
Damn it, Senay Hanim!
I loved you.
I was in love with you.
Head over heels in love with you.
I was wild about you.
The whole neighbourhood
took the piss out of me.
But I listened to no one.
What is it they say?
Love is blind.
Let love be blind.
So I was living in a fairytale world...
The fairytale's over.
Damn it!
Lt's over!
A fairytale!
Lt's over!
Ooph! I expect I'd be dead
if I had the same treatment as Hilmi Abi.
But our Hilmi survived.
He left home that night. And that was it.
No one ever saw him again.
I did. I saw him.
But first we must go back to
the beginning of the story, to that night.
Old lhsan Karal, the guy who died,
was one of the underworld kings.
He had a daughter too, you know? A beauty.
A princess cosseted from the world.
Please, turn off those cameras.
This is the worst moment of my life!
Guys, please clear out of here.
- Where is he?
- They took him to the morgue.
Hurrem! You killed him! It was you!
- Dear girl, at this painful time...
- Painful? Lt's you who killed him!
Hear this, everyone!
This woman killed my father.
Dirst she kills my mother, then my father!
- My dear girl! Idil!
- And she even says 'my dear girI'!
You slut! Slut! Bitch! You slut! Bitch!
Get out of here!
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all?
Huh! At last...
They had to give you tranquillisers.
You've disgraced
both your father's name and me.
Anyway, I've had a word with the TV guys.
They won't be showing your temper tantrum.
- How did it happen?
- How did what happen?
My father...
He had a boozy lunch and stayed there
all afternoon. The place closed.
While he was there sitting alone
the guy streaked in. There you have it.
- Where was his bodyguard?
- The guy walked over him too.
It could be anyone.
The man lived on a knife-edge anyway.
It's just you and me now, Idil.
I get the picture. You're a wild child.
You never treated me like your mother.
You just saw me as a passing mistress.
Now look, let me give you some advice.
Be sensible and I'll see to it
you live like a princess.
You can go back to New York,
carry on with college...
I'll send your money, every penny of it.
You can do your own thing.
But if you're looking for trouble...
Well, you've more than met your match.
Is that a deal?
What do you see?
Stage queen!
One-time Miss Turkey.
This business is to be fixed
once and for all.
The girI's overstepped the mark.
She's a big risk to us.
She's in your hands from now on.
Dix it.
Did you understand?
Duck! We hit the guy...
Move it! Step on it! Come on!
We have things to do.
Idil...
Idil...
Idil, it's me, Ramazan.
Ramazan Abi...
Where have you been?
Don't tire yourself.
We have to get out of here.
This place is dangerous.
Come on.
You have to hide tonight.
Have some of this.
It'll will calm you down.
Now come on, climb out.
Where are we?
Am I supposed to hide somewhere here?
No. Now...
We'll just wait for you to fall asleep.
It'll kick in within the next half hour.
Was that stuff drugged? Why?
We've reached the end of the road, Idil.
Once you're asleep,
I'll give you a small injection too.
Then you'll sleep forever.
They'll find you here
somewhere round here in the morning.
I'll leave a needle by you for decoration.
It won't hurt a bit, don't worry.
Ramazan Abi,
you were my father's right-hand man.
You used to take me to school.
That witch Hurrem
even got you under her spell.
Idil, what do you take this business for?
Now, look here.
It's nothing like studying
fancy stuff in the US. Got it?
This country's mixed up, girl.
Hurrem is now out of her depth. So am I.
The decision to kill your Dad
came from high up. And we said yes.
If we hadn't, they'd have
done away with us. Got it?
- Help!
- Get moving!
Where are you going to run to? Huh?
Those bastards are everywhere.
You think they'd leave you alone?
You talked utter bullshit on TV tonight.
They'll be out to get you.
You've nowhere left to run.
- But you killed him.
- I told you, we had no choice.
Don't you understand?
The drugs have made you whatever...
You're almost asleep.
- You killed my father.
- He deserved to die.
He thought he was king.
Nice... I thought he was king too.
I latched onto him.
I gave him my life.
I wandered far and wide,
trudged across hill and dale.
Then I stopped to look back.
And what did I see?
That I'd got almost nowhere.
Your Dad would sit me
on his knee and tell me cute stories.
I liked lhsan Abi.
He picked me up off the street
and made a man of me.
He may have been your father,
but he was also mine up to a point.
But it's good for everyone that he's dead.
The gods of this world are different, Idil.
They'd take you away in broad daylight.
No one would notice.
Your Dad's killers will never be found.
Neither will yours.
Come on, girl. Come on, Idil.
Let's get this over with.
Idil!
Help!
Hey, have you broken it?
Help!
Idil!
Lt's here I crossed paths with Idil Hanim.
As she stumbled on my shelter.
Who is it? Who's there?
Don't be afraid, girl!
I won't hurt you.
What are you doing here?
Someone's after me. A murderer!
Idil!
Hey, come on. I was only joking.
- Why give me such a hard time, Idil?
- Abi, please don't!
Abi, please don't!
Abi...
Dor God's sake!
Abi, is that your fiancee?
Mind your own business, dwarf!
Or I'll do away with you.
- Who are you calling a dwarf?
- You, damn it!
What can you do anyway?
Move it, girl! Move it!
Come on! Move it!
In you go...
I'm going. Come with me
if you want. It's up to you.
Who are you?
I'm talking to you, Abla.
Who are you? What the hell are you?
Who's that freak?
What did he want from you?
Ramazan Abi.
He was my father's number one man.
Hey, the guy was sticking heroin in you!
If he'd gone any further you'd be dead.
They're all traitors! What am I
going to do? Who am I supposed to trust?
That's the way of the world, love.
You shouldn't trust anyone.
Look, I trusted people
and what happened?
I landed on the street,
hungry and all on my own.
I had seven brothers.
I was the youngest.
We had a cabin some place in the forest.
We counted our blessings
and lived happily enough.
But what happened? They threw me
out of house and home. Why?
Because this world's a man's world.
If you're female, they walk
all over you or put you to work.
Didn't I think to be like my brothers?
Sure, I did.
I worked harder than they did.
I'm strong as an ox, for example.
My nickname's Beefy.
Everyone has nicknames
where I come from, you know.
Like Sneezy. Or Happy.
Like my eldest brother, Doc.
Stuff the nicknames. Seven no-hopers.
Men, right? They're all the same.
Everyone thought they were cute.
They were short, right?
Plus they did all kinds of tricks.
No one knew their sister was
a doormat on the streets of Istanbul.
That half the city's dropouts
had walked over the poor thing.
Where are you taking me?
Trust me and don't worry about the rest.
I'll take you somewhere you know.
Then you go your way and I'll go mine.
Come on. Dollow me.
Where are we?
What's that noise?
They've dug this place to death.
Go to the bowels of the earth
and they'd still come after you.
They've built a railway, haven't they...
Come on, girl.
I'm... So exhausted.
Can't I sleep just here?
Are you crazy?
You have to find somewhere else.
Come on, let's go.
We'll sort something out in a bit.
I don't have the strength
to take another step.
Oh God! You're nothing but trouble!
- I'm asleep on my feet.
- Dine. Shall I tell you a story then?
'Dusk... Dusk falls again...
Dusk again...'
'Would that I were a reed
on the lake at this hour.'
Those great lines of Ahmet Hasim
make me think of a story, a fairytale...
Imagine, that same
dusk hour in Istanbul...
A beautiful woman has stumbled
upon the love of her life...
- Were you closing?
- No, we're still open.
- I wanted to try on those shoes.
- What size?
40.
We have no large sizes here right now.
They're in the stock room.
If you're sure you're a 40,
I'll fetch you a pair.
I can be a 41 with some shoes.
Why don't I come with you?
Love is a flame that warms you from afar.
But try touching it and it'll scorch you.
They'll be over there.
- Can I try them on?
- Sure.
- It fits like a glove.
- Let me try the other one.
What are you doing?
- I'm crazy for you...
- What?
- I'm crazy for you.
Ever since you first came to the store.
Whenever you pass by,
I think I'm about to lose it.
You go past at the same time every day.
I'm going to lose it!
Do you do it on purpose?
- What's your name?
- Banu... Let's say.
Who are you? What are you?
Are you human or spirit?
Just someone like you.
I... I've never looked at a girl
like this before.
I'm not a girl.
Girl, woman...
What's the difference?
I'm on fire.
I'mve never felt this way before.
- Wait, I want to say something.
- Look, if you want money, that's OK.
Don't think I don't have money.
I do. I'mve saved up.
I never sleep with anyone for money.
But don't think I don't realise. You...
Anyway... Take it if you must. Money...
You nutcase...
I'm crazy about you too.
Why do you think I go past the store?
You? You're crazy about me?
Come here.
- What's your name?
- They call me Diko. - Diko.
There, that's love for you.
There's no telling where it'll
come from or when it'll strike.
Some people are puzzled by some
romances. They find them strange.
Are you one of them?
In that case, it's you that's strange.
You see, in the land of love
nothing is strange, nothing impossible...
Will you go off now
and do what we did with someone else?
I couldn't take it!
- Banu... I have savings.
- I can't take money from you.
I don't mean for that. Of course not.
We're lovers now, aren't we?
Don't take money from anyone any more.
Come with me
and let's get out of Istanbul.
- They wouldn't let me go.
- Who? Who wouldn't let you go?
We can'tjust do our own thing
in this job, you know.
Pretend you're going out to work.
They wouldn't even notice.
- Where would we go? What would we do?
- We can go to Eskisehir, to my sister's.
Your sister?
Don't worry. She's an angel.
She won't act the sister-in-law with you.
Now listen. There's a train to Ankara
at midnight on the dot. Drom Haydarpasa.
Now go and get your things
together. I'll buy the tickets.
Be at Haydarpasa for
11.45 at the latest. OK?
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
You're very cute.
Where the hell have you been all day?
Recep was looking for you.
I was out and about.
I bought some shoes.
You could have phoned to say so.
Behave like that and you're out of here!
Recep will stick a knife in your ass.
- Have you seen this?
- What's that, Birsu Abla?
The phone bill. Since you arrived
it's shot up to 100 million.
- We'll share it.
- No, we won't. You pay this month's.
But I don't have that much.
- You have enough for shoes though.
- And the beauty salon.
Hey, what is this? I work. I make money.
I'll spend it however I want.
You don't work.
Rahsan and I do it 10 times some nights.
After two customers, you're home asleep.
That's for starters...
Secondly, you never spend
the money you earn on this place.
You could buy cakes, bananas, whisky
or whatever on the way home.
Hey, what's with the noise?
Ah, Recep... Is that you?
We didn't hear you.
Of course you didn't.
Your mouths work like your down below.
You landed us with this pathetic tart.
She's winding us up again.
She thinks she's smarter, prettier,
more of a woman... Half-baked cunt.
Well you have to put up with her.
What is this? A five-star hotel?
Sure, she's more of a
woman than you in some places.
Isn't that right, Banu?
God! When was the work of human knives
the same as God given blessings?
Rahsan, shut it
or I'll butcher your blessings!
Besides, the guys
who go for her are one thing...
And the guys
who go for you are another.
Come on, get your shit together.
Doll yourselves up. We're off to work.
A booking?
A friend called. He's entertaining.
Arabs and that. You'll wangle a good tip.
- We're going to Gebze.
- But I can't go to Gebze.
What's that supposed to mean?
I...
I made appointments. With two
customers. I can't not turn up.
Appointments? Behind my back?
What's this shit you're up to on your own?
I'm not up to anything.
But I can't go to Gebze.
Oh no! I can't go to Gebze!
Oh no! I can't wear clothes of muslim!
Hey, stop laughing!
No one takes the piss out of underdogs.
Banu, haven't you got feisty...
- Step out here with me for a minute.
- Why?
Because I say so, damn it!
Lt's that easy, is it?
Hang out with the clients you want...
Make pocket money for yourself,
sleep with one guy and not the other...
Ah, Istanbul's a dream!
Look, I brought you into this the world.
I stood behind you.
You're my woman.
I love you, damn it.
What kind of love is that?
You don't sell someone you love.
An artist loves his paintings
but he sells them.
A sculptor his sculptures.
Look, what's between us is business.
It's our business.
I mean, a strategic partnership.
You'll be my wife, Banu.
I'll marry you. Give you a white wedding.
If you're not coming on the job,
where are you going?
Are you going off to other guys?
If you try leaving this house once again...
Leave the girl alone!
Mimi Bey!
What do you want from the poor girl?
She's new. She doesn't know the ropes.
She won't listen.
I thought I'd teach her a lesson.
Come here, girl.
- She has to work tonight, Abi.
- Get over here, girl!
No one gets trampled on
while I'm around, Recep.
If you're going to work, do it
sensibly and by the book. Otherwise,
I'll make life hell for you. Understand?
- My dear Mimi Bey...
- Cut the grovelling.
Drom now on,
this girI's under my protection.
Hey, Mimi! The girI's mine.
My property and my wife. I respect you,
but overstep the mark and...
You can fuck your mark!
Bastard!
Have a seat, dear.
He's an animal! An animal!
He walks round thinking he's human.
Here, girl. Get this down you.
It'll help calm you down.
- Mimi.
- Huh?
- I'mve heard your name so often.
- They call me Mimi. In this world...
Yes, even I've forgotten my real name.
Why did Recep suddenly get scared?
I know his godfather.
Actually, his father too.
There was a time when
everyone in this world knew me.
I had so many godfathers on their knees.
They'd do anything for me.
Well, once you start falling,
there's no end to it, darling.
These days, I only have the sway
to deal with the likes of Recep.
You saved my life, really.
Thanks so much.
You're welcome. Come on.
- Where are you from, girl?
- Izmir... Kadifekaleli.
Actually, we're immigrants.
I came to Istanbul with that Recep.
He paid for my operation too.
But he started selling me right away...
In between saying he loved me.
You mean were stuck with Recep
with a face and a figure like that?
I'mve been in this world for years.
I mean, you could even have fooled me.
I'mve seen enough cross-gender girls,
but not one as feminine as you.
We were born wrong, Abla. God knows best,
but he gave me the wrong body.
If I'd stayed in lzmir,
I'd have killed myself.
It was Recep's idea
to beat it to Istanbul.
He said I'd become a woman, be his wife.
I arrived, but Recep's...
Stop! Enough!
I'm depressed enough as it is. Enough!
I'mve seen thousands like you
flock to Istanbul and go to waste.
Like roaches given a dose of Shelltox.
I don't know what it is
with this Istanbul...
Here, take that money.
A ticket to lzmir and, if you're careful,
it'll keep you going for a month or so.
Now go buy your ticket and get home.
Dind a job. Don't waste yourself here.
Why are you giving me this money?
What do you want from me, Abla?
Nothing. I settled an old account.
It's from that.
How do you say? I don't want to spend it
on myself. Oh God, it's a long story.
Now do you want to go home
or not, dear? Tell me that much.
I can't go back home.
But I was actually planning
to get out of Istanbul tonight.
I have a lover.
In the name of God,
the Compassionate, the Merciful...
You have a lover?
What's the matter, girl?
He thinks I'm a real woman.
But you are a real woman.
And a beauty at that.
Now come with me
and let's make you even lovelier.
Come on, up you get!
- How does it look, Mimi?
- Gorgeous! That colour really suits you.
Now try this one.
- Abla, is this yours as well?
- Yes, dear.
It was, 20 years and 20 kilos ago.
Of course, it wasn't so easy going out
in those days. Only on special occasions...
Let me see.
Don't give me everything you have, Abla.
One would be enough.
You're starting a new life, dear.
You need a couple of new outfits.
Hold it up. Go on!
So the two of you fell in love from afar
without knowing.
It's like a miracle, isn't it?
Well, as far as I know,
these things don'tjust happen overnight.
So many men get off on one-night stands.
Then they deflate like balloons.
But hopefully yours is an exception.
Is he good-looking?
Yes, he is.
- It's just he's a bit younger than me.
- But that's OK.
Hey, Abla. Come and see us off.
Then you'll get to meet Diko.
Besides, I'm scared of leaving alone.
I could run into that bastard Recep.
Please come, Abla!
Recep can't lay a finger on you
while I'm around, don't worry.
OK, I'll take you there.
Out you go.
Come on.
I'll call as soon as I get to Eskisehir.
I'll never forget your kindness, Mimi.
Muhsin.
Huh?
My name's Muhsin... Call me Muhsin.
There's still time
before the train leaves.
- He'll show up.
- He'll.
Don't get upset. Come on, it's OK.
You'll see a lot more like him.
Do you think he realised?
Dorget it. How would he realise?
Why would someone lie like that? Why?
Dor a free fuck.
- Well, well, well...
- Where to, sugarplums?
Mind your own business!
- Take it easy!
- What's going on?
How much?
- How much is what?
- A hit.
Who's hitting on who?
Watch your mouth, fag,
or your family's fucked.
Oh yeah?
Damn it, there was only one pimp.
Now there's two.
Where the fuck do you belong?
Duck off!
- Hey! You come here!
- Recep!
- Hey, where are you going behind my back?
- Recep...
You keep out of this, fucker.
Huh? Where are you going?
Run!
What have you done to me, Banu?
Banu!
Come here, Banu!
Go then,
but I'll catch you before morning!
Mimi Bey, did you hear
lhsan Bey's met his maker?
- What's he talking about?
- Lhsan or someone. He's dead.
Hey, Banu! You're mine! Banu, you're mine!
There is no other Istanbul, damn it!
There is no other Recep, damn it!
Where are we going?
I don't know.
If you're asking why Diko didn't turn up,
if it was all a big lie, I don't think so.
It wasn't that he didn't turn up.
He couldn't, if you ask me.
- Duck! We hit the guy...
- Move it! Step on it!
Come on! We have things to do.
Even to love a simple neighbourhood
is worth a lifetime.
Who said that? Oh no! I'mve forgotten.
Long ago, our ancestors took this city.
They built inns, baths, mosques, houses...
Istanbul became ours.
But then foreigners arrived
like moths to the light.
Some had their wings
scorched and went away.
Others became lords, pashas, princes...
And some were astonishingly like us.
- The restaurant's closed, friend.
- I looking Seyhmuz Abi.
What are you saying?
I looking Seyhmuz Abi. I Musa.
Dellow countryman. Coming back from army.
Seyhmuz Abi. Seyhmuz.
Seyhmuz is in the kitchen.
Look, you go through there.
You were once skinny as a rake.
You seem to have gone overboard
with the wining and dining, lhsan.
Why deprive yourself
of the good things in life, Mimi?
Anyway, guys like me
don't die of wining and dining.
We race around in the dark.
Besides, look at you.
The graceful swan I once had as a friend
has turned into a fat sausage.
We're just friends now, are we?
Why did you ask me here?
Because I owe you. That's why.
Owe me what?
You're having a tough time
by all accounts.
Here, take this.
It'll keep you going for a while.
- You're giving me charity?
- Charity? I'm helping out.
My affections don't stop
at the market place.
They go all the way to the grave.
I mean, out of sight
doesn't mean out of mind.
Take it...
Dor old times' sake.
If you called and asked how I was
for old times' sake, that would do.
I have money.
I don't need your charity.
My friend...
What's up, Ramazan?
What's up?
I heard you were here, that's all.
I have a small favour to ask you.
Sure. Have a seat.
Mimi Bey was leaving anyway.
What's the problem?
Your Seyhmuz Abi is here.
Seyhmuz Abi, at last I found you.
I'm your fellow countryman, Musa.
I can't understand what you're saying.
I forgot the language.
I'm an Istanbul boy now.
Don't you speak Turkish?
Learning in the army.
'Learning' is a bit weird.
'I learned' is what you say.
'I learned in the army.'
I learned.
Being on duty, not knowing password,
getting beaten up...
Dorgetting national anthem,
getting beaten up...
Getting beaten up, getting
beaten up, I learning...
Well, anyway.
What do you want, friend?
Zilha Ana sending me. Dinding Seyhmuz.
Kissing his hand... I doing any job.
Zilha Ana sends everyone my way.
I respect her but every
place has its limits.
You're no good to us.
This place is a classy joint.
Seyfo has a place. I'm sending you there.
He knows loads of people.
He'll fix you up with work.
A building job at least...
Now, here's the address.
You take the 59A bus.
And you get out at this stop.
If you're hungry, get something
down you, then go.
What the hell was that?
The police will be here! Beat it!
Through the back door. Go on, quick!
They're here again.
Sezai Pasha?
Sezai Pasha's here.
Sezai Pasha?
Welcome!
What an honour!
Pasha, are you hungry?
You shouldn't have gone to the trouble.
That peasant guard of ours
can't even make a sandwich.
Let me prepare you something exquisite.
This way... You can't eat in the kitchen!
Let's go to the drawing room.
This way, pasha. You can relax
while I fix you an appetizer. OK?
This way, pasha.
Welcome, pasha.
Everyone's been to visit.
You're the only one who hasn't, pasha.
They're here all the time.
Hasene Hanim visited last night.
So did Dilruba Hanimefendi
and Sermet Mufit Bey.
Letafet, the servant...
She tours the basement every night.
But it's such a shame!
They don't know they're ghosts.
They think they're still living
in the glorious days of this palace.
They don't know everyone's dead and gone.
I'm the only one left in the family.
And Recai.
But you know, don't you?
Careful!
You know you're a ghost, don't you?
You're not of this world any more.
You've just come to visit me.
- You're dead.
- No, I living...
No, no. You're dead.
It's sad. Ghosts get all confused like that.
They don't realise what's become of them.
Goodness, pasha!
Why are you so surprised
to see your portrait?
We've been looking at each other
for almost a century.
Sezai Pasha and his great love, Saliha.
Our love lives on in the portraits.
She's never visited either.
My great grandmother, Saliha Hanim.
She hasn't been
because she lives on in me.
We look very alike, don't we?
A carbon copy of me.
Or rather, I'm a carbon copy of her.
Is she me, or am I her?
That's a bit of a muddle.
I going...
- You can't! I still have to make a meal.
- No meal.
Then have some of my coffee, pasha.
I'mve been waiting
a whole century for you.
No... Everyone's dead. I'md like to die too
but itjust won't happen.
I sleep.
- Dor ages. It think it's been a century.
- Give money!
Then I wake up in the mor...
- Excuse me, pasha?
- Money.
Give money!
Don't mention it, pasha.
You have financial troubles, do you?
- Is that why you're so quiet?
- Not quiet... Di-nan-cial trou-bles...
Giving money.
They've been in my bosom for a century.
You gave them to Saliha Hanim. Remember?
They passed to my grandmother,
then my mother and now me. Little Saliha.
And now they're coming back to you!
Life!
Saliha?
My brother's here.
Saliha?!
Hey, girl!
Why come at this hour? People sleep.
They talk to the ghosts of ancestors...
God! Something urgent came up
or I'd hardly be disturbing you.
Are you out of money again?
You're so mean.
Maybe I wanted to see you.
Is it the palace business?
- This guy showed up today.
- No!
You asked before and got your answer.
My answer's no. This palace is mine.
Ours.
Half is yours, half mine.
It's ours.
Anyway, let's have a drink.
Then we'll talk. Huh?
You have a drink too. Huh?
Look, Saliha. You're young and single.
This huge palace is far too big for you.
You've come unhinged living here anyway.
Just look at you. Look at them.
Look at your great-grandmother.
You get more like her every day.
Besides, they're ghosts not portraits.
They'd talk given half a chance.
Let's get rid of the lot, sell it.
We'd get good money for it.
Whisky... You know what the Japanese say?
Lt's funny. They call it 'usku'.
They can't say 'whisky'.
'Usku on de rockus'.
In other words, 'whisky on ice'.
Anyway.
I'll get to the point then.
This guy showed up today.
You know how much
he'll pay for this palace?
$4 million.
What does that mean?
What does it mean?
It means $2 million for you.
We'll move you to a nice apartment.
I mean, you can have
a house in Bodrum if you like.
We'll fix you up with a decent maid.
Then we take it easy.
That's what it means.
You had me sell that business centre
in Bomonti just the other day.
Right, but the other day is two years ago.
Besides, what's a business centre worth?
If you split the proceeds over two years...
It doesn't cover the kids' school fees
and the wife's toiletries.
This place is mine. I won't have it sold.
I'm going to die here.
You can do what you like once I'm dead.
Honey...
Look, this buyer
isn't your normal kind of guy.
He's king of the underworld
for God's sake.
Lhsan Bey...
lhsan Karal...
Have you heard of lhsan Karal?
I mean, if the guy says
he wants to buy this place, he will.
It's not an offer. It's an order.
This palace will be sold.
No, it won't.
Hey, you want to shoot me in the foot?
I'm talking lhsan Karal.
I'm talking the king of the underworld.
I'm talking $4 million...
- Your talk means nothing to me.
- Cut it out, you psycho!
Enough! Shut up and listen to me!
This is for your good. Don't you see?
Do you have to drive me crazy?
It won't be sold!
What does that mean?
I'll have you locked up.
They'll stick electrodes in your ass.
You'll go to the fairies.
What do you mean, 'I won't selI',
'I'm going to die here'?
Suppose I die before you?
Don't glare at me like that.
Answer me!
Poor Mum. She'd always say...
'I can't decide
if this girI's an angel or a devil.
'If she's really mad
or smarter than us all.'
I'm smarter than you for sure.
I learnt everything
without going to school.
You haven't even learned
your times table yet.
Duck off!
- Six times eight? - 48.
- Eight times six?
- Dorty... eight.
- 16 times 22? 22 times 14?
14 times 86?
86 times 124? 124 times 216?
Are you taking the piss?
Are you taking the piss, psycho?
I'll strangle you! I'll do it right here!
They'll find your corpse.
Who'd ever know? I'md say you died.
And the palace would be mine.
Who'd realise, huh? I'll kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!
Hey, who are you?
You... You... Sez.
Sez-ai Pasha...
Saliha, look! Sezai Pasha is here.
I Musa. What pasha?
I don't know what
got into my brother, pasha.
There you are, a man who faints
when he sees his great-grandfather...
Pasha, you go now. Come visit me again.
Dorgive your great-grandson.
I don't understand you exactly, sister.
You don't understand me either.
But I'm not a pasha.
The pasha's dead and buried.
I'm Musa. Musa. Drom Hakkari.
Son of Kadir.
I'mve never borrowed from anyone.
I'mve never stolen either.
But let's call this a loan.
I'm desperate, honestly. One will do.
I promise it's a loan.
I'll pay you back one day.
Pay you back? You're speaking
the language of the other world, pasha.
I don't understand a word.
The pasha's just a portrait. You're living
in a dream. It's time you woke up.
OK. The pasha going...
I close my eyes like this
when visiting ghosts leave.
Then I open them and they've gone.
They disappearjust like that.
Pasha, I look forward to seeing you here.
Don't be offended by Recai.
I'll be waiting for you here.
I'll wait another 100 years if I have to.
I'm a bit muddled, you know.
Don't believe the tales I tell you,
but do listen.
Istanbul... Well, who isn't muddled?
Once upon an evening in Istanbul,
my Mum and I left prison.
The world is a huge great ball
with loads of cities on it.
Of all these cities
the nicest one of all is Istanbul.
I'm sure of that
because I've never seen Istanbul.
Hello. They should have sent me a ticket.
One-way to Berlin.
- What was the name?
- Derin. Melek Derin.
Your phone's charged, miss.
Another of the same.
- Congratulations! You're out.
- Thanks.
- Rafet Abi also sends his wishes.
- Thank him too.
So you're going back to Germany.
My parents sent me a ticket.
It isn't as easy as that
to walk away from this business
I've had two years wrecked
on the basis I'd make some easy cash.
All thanks to your Rafet Abi.
He can go to hell!
- Speak Turkish!
- Istanbul stinks. You can keep it!
There's no place like Germany.
The land of milk and honey...
Cut the rough talk. If I'd wanted,
I'd have had you cleaned up inside.
Rafet Abi said to deal with you
the moment you stepped out of line.
It's up to me if you get on that plane.
I can finish you off right here.
Duck off!
You're lucky you can
keep your mouth shut.
You kept quiet inside.
Rafet Abi was full of
praise for you for that.
If you'd gabbed,
you'd have been finished.
If you gab now,
you'll still be finished.
Go home like a good girl
and no one will get hurt.
But if you say one word to land us in it
your whole family regrets it.
You hear me?
I don't know
what you did to Rafet Abi...
But he has a soft spot for you.
'Ich liebe dich'.
I mean, he loves you.
You have him to be grateful for.
Have a good trip.
Say hello to Germany for me.
My Mum and I used to talk a lot.
But not any more.
Before, she'd always tell me stories.
But not any more.
Hello?
I don't want to speak to you,
Mahir Abi. Don't push it.
- Rafet?
- Hi, Melek.
- What's up, Rafet?
- Congratulations. You're out, huh?
Your guy's been on my back
since I leftjail.
He said hello.
I'm just passing that on.
So you're running off to Berlin, huh?
We won't get to see each other
any more, huh?
- We've been through all that.
- You don't talk about us. You and me.
That's one passenger
and no other bags, right?
You know my Mum.
And now you'll get to meet my Dad.
- Hello?
- Don't hang up on me or I'll get nasty.
Now listen.
That bastard Mahir is after you.
- Who's Mahir?
- That big-time hack, Mahir.
You know him.
He wants to get you talking.
I mean... If he finds out
you and I were together...
Rafet, I don't know you, your friends
or anyone. I never have.
I haven't lived the last five years.
Half my brain's wiped out.
Hey, congratulations!
Smart lady!
You know what you're doing.
- I'm going to miss you.
- I won't miss you.
That's my Dad. Rafet. He's to thank
for me being around and Mum going to jail.
But he's never known me, never seen me.
If you're asking why, I'll explain.
Coming up soon...
Melek, a member of the smuggling ring
arrested at Ataturk Airport 2 years ago...
Was released from jail today.
Melek will return to Germany
with her secrets.
And she'll leave behind
another criminal file to gather dust.
What are her secrets?
What did she bring in?
What is she taking away?
Coming up soon...
Melek!
- Why are you afraid of me?
- Who's afraid of you? I'm afraid of dying.
Look, baby. Everything's out in the open.
I just need to talk to you.
If you hadn't confessed,
it wouldn't be like this.
You've spent the last two years
paying the price for what they did.
Who are 'they'? I don't
know who you're talking about.
You know very well.
The guys who got you
into this smuggling racket.
The mob you spent two years in jail for.
Don't say you've never
even heard of Rafet?
Rafet? Who's that?
Melek, cut the acting. Rafet conned you.
He's had you do his dirty work for years.
But when you got busted, he disowned you.
These are plain facts. Right?
Now he's threatening you
so you keep quiet.
But if a few people like you spoke out,
we'd have them nailed.
Listen, I've heard rumours.
They say you had a relationship
with that bastard Rafet.
The guy hooks romantic innocents like you,
has you fall in love with him, uses you...
Gets you into all kinds of shit,
then drops you.
It seems you had the same kind of
romance-business deal going with him.
You were in love with Rafet, right?
He used you like a dishcloth
and tossed you out, didn't he?
Look, Melek.
I'mve been after you since
you were busted. That's two years.
You're my only hope of
exposing this business.
The police know everything,
but they have no evidence.
Come and do a program with me.
Explain everything. The rest is easy.
Melek! Look. You see?
The king of your bunch got killed today.
There's talk that his wife had him killed.
Your Rafet was a slave to him, a nothing.
He was the root of the trouble.
He's been dispatched to the next world.
Now if you talk, it'll be the nail
in the coffin. We'll clean up this filth.
I know they've been on your back
since you got out.
They'll do whatever it takes
to stop you talking.
They're making death threats.
What big eyes you have, Mahir Abi!
All the better to see
what you're hiding, my dear...
And what big ears you have, Abi!
Like radars...
Cut the jokes.
Everyone thinks I'm a wicked wolf
but I have the heart of a lamb.
I feel bad for you. I'm trying to help.
I'mve tried to persuade you for two years.
You have my word.
I know people in the police.
Come and talk. There's nothing
to be afraid of. I'll protect you.
Nothing to be afraid of.
Huh, there's nothing to be afraid of.
That's exactly
what my Dad said that day.
Hey, there's nothing to be afraid of.
It'll be over in no time.
Mum was pregnant with me,
but my Dad didn't want me.
They went to hospital together,
to a doctor Rafet knew.
Don't cry.
I warn you, I'll get violent!
Lt's OK. Quiet!
I told you it'll be over in no time.
It really was over in no time.
They got rid of me in half an hour.
Or that's what Rafet thought,
because Mum never forgot me.
Mum kept wondering what I'd be like.
She didn't know if I was a girl or boy.
But she always imagined
I was a little girl. I mean, like this.
A little girl who'd never grow up,
never be hurt by anyone...
A girl, who'd stay sweet and innocent forever.
When Mum went to jail
because of Rafet, I was with her.
Dor two years she poured out
her troubles and told me everything.
So I was a girl who was never born,
I was a girl who lived in the imagination.
There was nothing holding me back,
no doors barred. I could go anywhere.
The past, present, future, everywhere...
It was all open to me.
When Mum was asleep behind bars,
I went out exploring Istanbul.
I went everywhere, explored everywhere
Istanbul was full of fairytales.
I got to learn the heart of
those tales by heart.
Once upon a time,
there was me and there wasn't me.
I was and I wasn't.
That's why I understood everything
better than anyone.
Come and talk. I'll protect you
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Don't believe him, Mum.
He's another of Rafet's traps.
He's testing you one last time.
Don't believe the man whatever you do.
Go on, say it's a deal.
Talk. It'll be so easy.
I promised my parents I'd be
in Germany tomorrow morning.
I'll have breakfast at home.
Piping hot tea, sausage, eggs...
I haven't done anything wrong.
I don't know
the guys you're talking about.
I feel like I know you from somewhere.
But where?
I don't know you either.
Are you sure?
Is that your final decision?
Have a good trip!
Mum's going home.
She's running away from Istanbul.
In her mind, in a corner of her heart
is another passenger...
With neither ticket nor passport.
Where did we leave Hilmi Bey?
He'd stormed out of home, hadn't he?
Before he ran into us,
Hilmi Bey spent the whole night walking.
Hey, you've broken it!
You've broken it, damn it!
You didn't break it!
You didn't get to break it!
Lt's the only thing
you didn't get to break!
I came to your Istanbul
and you stole my wife from me.
As if that wasn't enough,
you also stole my second wife.
And as if that wasn't enough,
you tried breaking this, but you failed!
You can't break it!
This is my weapon!
Lt's what I arm myself with!
You know what happens when I play?
Everything changes. Everything!
I'll change everything.
I'll dump you with your Istanbul,
your fairytale!
Wake up!
Everyone wake up!
Lt's all lies! Lies!
Lt's all one big fairytale!
Your love affairs, your homes...
They're all lies!
You're sleeping.
They've put you to sleep.
Come on! Let's get out of here!
Let's go!
Morning, brother.
What are you doing here at this hour?
I guess you have nowhere to go either.
Istanbul's finished anyway.
It's time to leave for another land.
Come on, Abi. Let's go!
Now, your Hilmi will play this
and everyone's eyes will open!
The mist will lift from everyone's eyes!
The lies will be exposed!
Everyone will be much happier!
Wake up! Wake up, people!
This land is not for us!
We're leaving for a land
that's altogether different!
The women there are different!
Love is different! Driends too!
Everything is just a little bit better!
More like the real thing!
Wake up! We're leaving this place!
Stay there on your own, Istanbul!
Empty of everything!
I'm taking everyone away!
Wake up, you whore of an Istanbul!
Wake up!
We were taken in by your fairytales!
We wasted our goddamn lives!
Wake up! Everyone, wake up!
The fairytale's over!
Aren't you awake yet?
I know how to wake you.
Once upon a time,
once upon a morning in Istanbul...
There was us and there wasn't us.
And that's as far as the fairytale goes...
