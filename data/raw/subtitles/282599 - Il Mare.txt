- Is this everything?
- Yes.
Let's get going!
Il Mare
Hello? Yes, it's me.
I really love this place. I even named it.
Who designed it? It's quite extraordinary.
I see.
Thanks again for the furniture and the stereo.
I'll call again soon.
Hi, I just moved into...
Hi
Hello
How are you?
Is the water hot enough?
Wow, these fellas sure look good!
I put in sliced carrots and onions
Get ready.
1, 2, 3... pull!!
- Help!
- We won!
One more time.
Let's begin at Merry Christmas.
Get with it!
- Let's get it right.
Ok, here we go.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Hi, I'm the previous tenant of your place.
I must ask you for a favor. I'm waiting for a letter.
If a letter arrives for me,
please forward it to the address below?
Thanks.
Best wishes, Kim Eun-joo, Dec. 21, 1999
P.S. The paw prints by the door
were there when I moved in...
...I never got around to removing them.
You'll get used to them.
Hello.
No, I was waiting for a call.
He's a jerk.
Merry Christmas...
Hi. Cigarettes, please.
Help yourself, they're over there.
What's that you write by your place?
"IL MARE". It means the "sea".
Sea? What do you know about the ocean?
I thought I'd start learning.
Did anyone live there before?
Nope. Your aunt finished building it a last month.
It's a brand new place.
- Time for dinner
- Ok.
Talk about a lousy disappearing act!
We brought your designs from school.
- Design my ass.
- Want some tea?
I'm leaving today to go study abroad.
Dropped by to say good bye.
I guess you have to get going.
Thanks for everything.
Learn as much as you can out there.
I think I should learn how to mend hearts first.
Hye-won, it's time to go. Let's get going.
Nice place. I'll come by again.
Come on.
Hey!
Hey, you!
P.S. The paw prints by the door
were there when I moved in.
I never got around to removing them.
You'll get used to them.
- Hello.
- Hey the girl from "il mur".
It's "Il Mare".
"il mur", "Il Mare", same difference.
Has the place been sold?
Nope.
May I go see it?
The keys are over there.
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.
- Honey, want some noodles?
- Add rice cakes too.
I thought I should write you.
I'm the first occupant of "Il Mare".
And I think your letter came to me by mistake.
I know you're waiting for important mail.
so you may want to check the address again.
Sincerely, HAN Sung-hyun Dec. 28, 1997
P.S. How did you know this place is called Il Mare?
I don't know how my letter got there...
...but I hope you're not playing some game.
Please don't tamper with my mail.
Sincerely, Kim Eun-joo Dec. 29, 1999
P.S. I hope you're not really from 1997.
I know it's the last day of the millennium.
Of course I want to go but I have to work...
I'll watch the shop for you.
Where should I meet you?
- I read 7 volumes.
- 2,100 Wons. Thank you.
Let's countdown to the new millennium together.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...
4... 3... 2... 1!
Happy New Millennium!
'Listen to this your letters keep ending up in my
mailbox.
You should look for other ways to retrieve your mail.
'Sincerely, Han Sung-hyun Jan. 7, 1998.'
'P.S. It is definitely 1998 right now.'
Eun-joo, you are the voice actor,
I'm the comic book store owner,
I should be the one with the crazy stories.
I know, but it's so weird.
I read more comics books anyhow!
1998?
- Hello.
- It's snowing Eun-joo!
You're right.
Remember 2 years ago? We caught the killer flu.
But I'm from an island, I can't resist the snow.
You'll watch the store for me tomorrow, right?
- Ok.
- Thanks.
Let's call it a day, guys.
- Sung-hyun, what're you waiting for?
- Coming.
Is the sky falling?
I thought I'd cover up the control box.
- No snow forecasts for tonight.
- Let's get a couple of drinks.
Sounds good to me.
It's going to snow a lot from Jan. 9 in 1998.
If you're still in 1998, watch out for the flu.
There was a nasty virus going around.
Dear Eun-joo, you were right, it snowed heavily on
January 9.
...and despite your warning, I managed to catch
the cold.
You must be a psychic because...
...I can't believe you're living in the future.
Psychic? I told you to...
I still can't believe that you're living in 1998.
But I don't think you're joking either.
I wish I was a psychic then I could tell the futur
But please forward my mail to me, ok?
- Let's go.
- I need to go somewhere.
- Tomorrow's the deadline.
- I'll do an all-nighter.
Why a construction site?
- She was telling the truth.
- What?
- I wonder what she looks like?
- Who?
The girl who lives there.
Fool, who the hell lives on a construction site?
Sung-hyun, hey man!
Hey, Cola. Look at the little fish eat.
- I have one more question...
- Dog? You mean Cola.
You're the one who had him first
so why did you leave him here?
He was wandering around Il Mare when I found him.
He sleeps like a person, doesn't he?
Hey, you're Cola?
Hey, Cola!
There must be a wrinkle in time...
...because he can't be in 2 places at one time.
He should only be with one of us.
but I swear that he's with me now.
It's the mail box, the mail box!
I think you're right.
But I'm not a big on hair bands my hair's a little
short.
Well, maybe you should grow it, it's a gift after all.
- We're going on a picnic.
- Whoopee!
I'm so excited!
Let's go!
Wait, I forgot our picnic basket.
Do you have the key?
No!
No one has the key!
Oh, no! Don't leave your keys behind.
Yeah!
Whoopee...
Hello?
Hello.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Hi.
- Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Worm.
Do you live here?
Sure. Here is my home.
I thought love meant eternal bliss.
Cooking sometimes helps.
If you want to cook pasta the right way,
...throw the cooked noodles at the wall.
If it sticks, it's just right.
Do you feel better?
We're tormented because love goes on...
...not because it goes away.
It's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all.
I hope you feel better, Eun-joo.
Request for academic leave.
You're an architect not a construction worker.
Why leave with only one semester left?
I hate all the hypocrites who preach family values.
Well, you should talk.
That's why I'm leaving.
Geez, you've been acting weird lately.
I feel like I'm being ambushed by memories
I'd rather forget.
Do you have any memories
you'd prefer to abandon?
Hey, Cola. Doing laundry can be therapeutic.
Thanks for helping me move in. I've tried to be a
nice neighbor.
But please stop leaving chocolate almonds in my mailbox.
The chocolate melts all over my mail.
This chocolate, chocolate...
The chocolate melts all over my mail and I can't read them.
What would I want back from 1998?
My friend gave me a tape recorder
to practice voice acting and I lost it.
I looked in my diary and it was on Feb. 11...
I was at the station on my way home.
I always sat on the last bench towards south.
I lost it that night.
Go there, and you'll see me in the year 1998.
I love you... I LOVE you...I love YOU...
Hey, wait! Eun-joo!
What're you doing?
Didn't you lose this?
Listen to this... I love you...
Hi, Eun-joo. It's me Sung-hyun.
- I hope you received the recorder.
- Hey, who's this?
Thank you for the recorder.
I'm sending you 2 gifts...
...but 1 of them may not get there because it's alive.
The earmuffs are to keep you warm.
If you need a favor from me, let me know.
Your aunt called me.
I know it's not easy for you, but she's like your mother.
...and she really wants you to do this.
Please go visit Professor Han at the hospital in right away.
In the year 2000, is there anything on Professor Han?
That's "Il Mare".
I can't accept...
...neither my father's death nor my love for him.
Yeah, I'm back from the hospital.
I'm ok.
Did you put the book in the mailbox?
Okay.
I'll go get it.
Seung Hyun.
There are 3 things a person can't hide...
...coughing, poverty and love.
The harder one tries to hide them,
the more they rise to the surface.
But there are times when you still want to hide them.
I just sit and cry...
...and cry until I can't anymore.
Love is a self-inflicted pain.
I hope you'll find peace within you.
Il Mare looks like a lonely place.
But its warmth and comfort comes from the love within.
Love comes to us in different ways
but underneath all those ways,
I believe there is only one love.
It's been delivered a little late..
but I hope your father's book
helped you to understand him.
Hye-gi!
Auntie!
- Have you been good, kiddo?
- Yes.
Are you ok?
Yes, how's dad?
He's at a seminar in Seoul.
Let's get in. Come on.
/ Let's go.
Eun-joo,
Everyone I loved
were always out of my reach...
...and I think I ached for them.
I was 7 when my father left me.
Cola!
It's dinner time.
You like Mr. Fish?
Cola,
I'll be right back. Be good now.
Gosh, it's freezing...
Excuse...
I saw you at the station tonight.
White sweater, black muffler,
and very long pretty hair...
Haven't heard from you in a while...
I'm anxious to hear from you.
Il Mare can make you feel so alone.
I felt like that when I was there.
Sung-hyun, wanna have some fun?
Go inside a convenience store and grab a beer.
Drink it down...
Now start running!
Go for a ride on the Viking.
The adrenaline rush is amazing.
This is the moment when...
It's my turn!
Take a bus to Bomunri.
Get off at Mulmok near the tree-lined boulevard.
Do you like to take walks?
It's a beautiful place to just walk alone
and think things through.
You'll feel better.
Just when you start to get tired,
You'll see a little cafe.
I go there to drink wine sometimes.
Do you like wine?
I heard that wine drinkers are lonely.
...but it doesn't matter to me.
I reserved a bottle of wine to be opened
in the year 2000.
How is it?
Wine is supposed to get better with age.
Thanks to you ...
I had a great time.
How about you, Eun-Joo?
I did too.
But I felt a little sad coming back alone.
I'd really like to meet you,
if it's ok with you.
Hey, Cola.
You really think we'll meet?
Can you come down to Cheju lsland?
I'm going home next week.
Cola, Cola!
Cola, I'm going to meet Eun-joo.
What'll we do for the next two years?
Are you looking at the photo?
The coral beach is where I want to live.
Once you see it you'll want to build a house on it.
Oh, our rendezvous date is March 11, 2000 at 3 pm...
on the coral beach.
March 11, 2000...
It's a Saturday.
Don't forget. I only have a week,
...but you still have over 2 years to go.
Eun Joo, aren't you going to sleep?
I'll be right down. Good night
Go to bed, dear.
Can I help you?
No, I was just...
Are you building a house here?
Yes, we are.
Are you going to live here?
No, I'm here for the construction.
Why do you ask?
Just curious...
A friend of mine designed it.
Isn't it perfect for this beach?
He dedicated it to his true love.
I see...
I gotta run.
Good luck.
I waited for you a long time.
I know 2 years is a long time
but I still hoped you'll show.
I guess I expected too much again.
I know I shouldn't...
because it always leads to disaster.
But everyone I care about is so far away.
What happened to you in those 2 years?
I hope you just forgot.
I wouldn't forget a promise like that.
This is breathtaking.
Sung-hyun's letters were little pieces of happiness.
But there still is this sense of emptiness.
Is it because of losing Ji-hoon?
Or not being able to meet Sung-hyun?
There's a technical problem...
so let's take a 30 min.
Let's get some coffee!
My treat!
More animation, the better. It means more work for us.
And it's great that are many big projects in the works.
That's true.
Sorry, I'm late.
No, not at all, I just got here too.
Ji Hoon, about our engagement...
Yeah, let's do it this month.
Really?
How about 2 Wednesdays from now?
Ok!
It's about time.
But why do you want to rush this?
I'm not rushing. You're the one who's stalling.
Just be patient...
until my animation project's finish.
ok.
I thought I could forget him...
...but when I heard his voice again,
everything fell apart.
I know he loves someone else...
...but I can't help it.
I can't stop thinking about him.
Please help me stop him from leaving.
I'm sorry..
I'm really sorry, Seung Hyun.
Hi. - Sorry, I'm late. It's ok. Are you hungry? -No but
dinner is on me. What should we eat? -Whatever you want.
Was I just a stranger to you?
Am I only a meaningless faceless stranger to you?
Jung Sook!
Was it the right decision not
to go with Ji-Hoon to USA?
and become a radio-performer?
Of course.
True love comes from true independence.
Forget all about Ji-Hoon.
I want to believe it too.
All I want is career and love.
My happiest moments were opening my mail
under your Christmas lights.
Eun-Joo.
It was really hard studying in the USA alone.
I just got too tired and lonely...
...and I wanted someone there.
I'm sorry...
We should have went together.
Please help me stop him from leaving me.
I'm so sorry,
I'm asking you for this.
I'm sorry, Seung Hyun.
I'll help you.
Why didn't you tell me how you felt before?
We don't have much time.
Eun Joo, do you remember your first letter?
You wished me good fortune at Il Mare.
Knowing you has been a blessing.
This time I want to return this good fortune to you.
Best wishes to you.
Thank you for everything.
Good bye...
Excuse me. Where's the department of architecture?
That's over there...
Thank you.
My Lord, you're the biggest whiner these days...
You are complaining about your room again?
Well, life isn't fair.
He dedicated it to his true love..
May I help you?
Sung-hyun dedicated it to you. Eun-joo.
It was a car accident.
Help me...
Help me stop him from leaving me...
He was on his way to Youido to meet someone.
The driver didn't see him.
Seung Hyun! Don't go there.
It's that house over there.
Please...
Please... hurry...
The letter has to reach him.
Seung Hyun, please don't go there.
It's all my fault.
The letter has to reach him in time...
Our last date was at a cafe called morning.
in Youido on March 25, 1998.
Cheer up, Eun Joo.
I'm not going away forever.
Don't be so down.
I know, I just feel weird.
I asked you to come with me.
It's not easy becoming a voice actor.
Not many people pass the exam.
It's only 3 years... right?
It will be alright.
I just feel so uneasy.
Please don't go.
Don't go there.
Don't die.
Seung Hyun... I'm sorry.
The fact that I don't show up 2 years from now...
...must mean that we weren't meant to be.
And you are...?
I hope you're ready to hear
a long and magical tale.
Can you trust me?
