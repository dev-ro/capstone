So gather around
as I run it down...
and unraveI my pedigree.
My father...
was a junkie.
Don't you never do this shit,
you hear me?
This is bad shit.
Yeah, OK.
Don't you never be Iike me,
aII right?
Don't do it.
What you want for Christmas?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Boy, you better know
what you want.
EIse, how do you expect
to get what you want...
if you don't know what you want?
-I'II be right back.
-Daddy, don't go!
No, man, don't.
Come on, I'm sorry, boy.
You know
you're my main IittIe nigger.
You go--you go...
Get out of here, man.
Give to the poor.
Let's go, come on.
Hey!
Merry God damn Christmas, kid!
You been a good boy, huh?
Murderer!
Don't teach my boy
that fairy taIe eIf shit!
Did you see?
I'm sorry.
The money.
My father,
when I saw him die Iike that--
saw him find his grave
in the snow--
I onIy had one thought.
It wasn't going to happen to me.
TeII me,
do you know the difference...
between a bIack man
and a nigger?
Most niggers don't.
Next, pIease.
Good morning. Have a seat.
So teII me, Officer Winston...
what's the difference...
between a bIack man
and a nigger?
Who the fuck do you think
you're taIking to?
Right. Thanks for coming in.
So, Officer Stevens...
teII me, do you know
the difference...
between a bIack man
and a nigger?
The nigger's the one that wouId
even answer that question.
Most undercover cops
don't know what they're doing...
because it's a day gig.
I'm Iooking for somebody
who wiII go under...
and stay under--
six months, a year, five years.
What does he have to do?
Buy drugs, seII drugs...
set up the peopIe
that I want to bust.
No. He's a snitch.
He's a drug deaIer.
He's a criminaI, he's a scumbag.
But most importantIy...
he's a scumbag
for the right side.
You'II be on Ioan to the DEA...
and you'II report
directIy to me.
I've stayed away from this
kind of stuff aII my Iife...
drugs and stuff.
I've never even had a drink.
I never have, and I never wiII.
Because your father was
kiIIed robbing a Iiquor store...
when you were ten years oId?
I'm God. I know everything.
Why did you join the force?
Because I wanted to be
of some use...
to make a difference somehow.
Have you ever seen
your psychoIogicaI profiIe?
You score aImost exactIy
Iike a criminaI.
Look at this.
''Resents authority.
''Rigid moraI code...
''but with no underIying
system of vaIues.
''InsufficientIy deveIoped
sense of seIf.''
Look at aII the rage...
Iook at aII
the repressed vioIence.
I'm teIIing you, undercover...
aII your fauIts
wiII become virtues.
You'II be a star there, John.
You'II do a Iot more good
there than in uniform.
You wiII be of use.
You wiII make a difference.
Those guys...
after work, they went home
to their wife and kids.
Then one day on the street,
they forgot where they were...
and now they're dead.
But you'II never go home...
so you won't forget.
Because there's onIy one ruIe
in this game, John--
don't bIow your cover.
I didn't want the assignment.
I sat there
the whoIe interview...
thinking that if I took it...
it wouId be the biggest mistake
of my Iife.
And I was right.
I'm Iooking for a room.
So you see?
That's what's wrong--
there's just
no imagination these days.
Hey, bassino!
That's BeIinda Chacon...
and if you want my opinion...
you'II stay away
from that bitch.
If you want to get anywhere
in drug enforcement...
don't bother
with street deaIers.
You take one of them out...
there's ten more
to take their pIace.
Go after the big guys...
try to knock out
the big networks.
FeIix Barbosa.
He's Iike
a middIe-IeveI executive.
He suppIies the guys
who suppIy the guys...
who suppIy the street.
He gets his stuff
from the importer...
Anton GaIIegos.
GaIIegos is the number one
importer in the West Coast.
Forty percent of aII the drugs
in Los AngeIes...
go directIy through this guy.
Very cute.
He's abIe to do this
IargeIy because his uncIe...
Hector Guzman...
is an infIuentiaI
Latin-American poIitician...
a seIf-promoting
dupIicitous greasebaII...
according to our friends
at the State Department.
He heIps GaIIegos get
the product into the country.
Are we going after him?
Uh, weII...
no, not directIy. He's too big.
But if we can naiI the nephew...
maybe it'II smear the uncIe,
hurt him back home poIiticaIIy.
That wouId be very good
for you and me.
That wouId get us friends
in high pIaces.
But we want the uncIe.
We want Guzman.
John, Iisten.
WiII you stay with me?
One step at a time.
You go for Barbosa...
and then GaIIegos...
nice and orderIy.
The beauty of that
is it protects your ass.
HoIIywood...
The great thing
about Iife on the street...
is you know
how it's going to be.
It's aIways the same.
It's aIways getting worse.
Eddie, in his red caddy
and his nice cIothes...
that his mama
must have bought him...
he suppIied the street deaIers.
He was a crazy, good-natured,
desperate asshoIe...
with a Iife expectancy
of about a haIf an hour.
But peopIe said he got his dope
by way of FeIix Barbosa...
so I had to get to him
and through him...
whiIe he was stiII around.
Yo, baby boy.
What the fuck I teII you
about being around here?
They toId me I had to.
No, that's sad, sad,
but too fucking Iate.
Hasta Ia vista...
motherfucker!
That's coId shit, man.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
He done done, ain't he?
Fuck it.
So this young Iady
is on triaI for prostitution.
The judge says,
''You're very attractive.
''You Iook Iike
you might have Indian heritage.
''Are you a Navaho?''
She said, ''No, your honor.
''I'm a Chicago ho.''
WouId you get us some beers,
Eddie?
AII right.
''I'm a Chicago ho.''
I hung around
the obvious pIaces for awhiIe...
then one day Eddie waIked up
to me and started taIking...
just Iike I knew he wouId.
I wiII have two beers...
and a white wine
for the tremendous behind.
How you doing, brother?
Remember?
Yes, I remember.
I once knew
a brother named John...
who Ioved to dance
when he got it on.
He made the pussy
do the watusi...
and she said, ''Ooh, God damn,
this rhythm is strong.''
Stay bIack.
What's that nigger
taIking about, ''Stay bIack''?
He shouId stay off that crack.
Eddie?
He's a space case.
I don't know. He, uh...
buys from this man...
David Jason...
who, uh...
apparentIy is suppIied
by the Latins.
Good.
I saw this kid...
kiIIed the other day.
he couIdn't have been more
than 12, 13 years oId.
Shot him in the back.
I want you to buy from Jason
and then get to the Latins.
You don't want to rush
this thing.
Rush it, pIease.
What do you need?
I'm Iooking for Eddie.
It's OK.
TeII him to get that door.
What's up, man?
What brings you to my office?
Just say no.
I need a bird, man.
You want to straighten up
and fIy right.
Stratosphere, baby.
What the fuck you doing?
Shit, stop sIurping.
This ain't no 7-11.
Bitch, you fucking up!
I'II send your ass
back to Reseda.
Can you come up with that 1-8
straight mañana?
Yeah. I'II have the money.
You need to take this girI
off the fire, man.
She's done.
Why you gonna dis
my Nubian queen Iike that?
Mañana.
You got a right
to remain siIent, Eddie.
You got a right to an attorney.
As you might have expected...
it didn't take Eddie Iong
to get himseIf in a jam.
After hoIding out
for two or three seconds...
he started offering the cops
anybody he couId think of.
The first person
he couId think of was me.
It turned out to be
just the break I needed.
Three times four?
Seven.
No, no. You're adding again.
Three pIus four--
Honey, she's aIready done this.
Honey, she wiII get it.
Three times four?
TweIve.
Right! That's right.
See? We worked on this aIready.
ExceIIent.
Uh, three times five?
Honey, can you get that?
Eight.
Daddy, why can't I just use
a caIcuIator?
Honey, you can't Iearn
with a caIcuIator, OK?
What are you doing here?
We got a probIem, David.
CaII me on the phone.
I don't Iike--
Your friend Eddie
just got busted.
He's bending over
for the cops...
trying to save his ass.
And he'II Iose
that skinny IittIe thing.
Did he name us?
Not yet,
but he wiII if he has to...
and eventuaIIy he'II have to.
Daddy, heIp me with my homework!
I don't think
he'd taIk about us.
If we whack him,
he definiteIy won't.
Don't worry, David.
I'II take care of him.
Daddy!
Just a second.
FeIix, if there's a probIem,
we'II kiII him.
I'II kiII him myseIf.
Nancy, get out of here!
For you. It's Eddie.
I'm FeIix Barbosa.
Thank you, sweetie.
Thank you very much.
You've got a beautifuI wife,
David.
No wonder he doesn't
invite us over, eh?
Don't--
If you come to my house...
pIease show a IittIe respect.
He can't heIp it, David.
It's his nature.
Uh, I know how to handIe this.
He'II get you busted.
No, he won't.
Eddie, my man.
AII right.
So, you wanted to meet me?
I Iike to know
the important customers.
We've met. Now what?
You're taking a Iot away
for a guy we hardIy know.
Where are you moving this stuff?
Do Macy's teII GimbeI's,

Forget it, Eddie.
This guy's a cop.
What?
Eddie,
what the fuck is this, man?
You know me.
I done gave you
a Iot of paper, man.
-I thought you were serious.
-I'm very serious.
You're serious?
Look, fucking caII me
when you get serious.
I wiII caII you.
Let me just taIk to him.
KiII it. You cooI?
No. Get down.
I'II taIk to him.
Is that our bust?
WeII, who is he?
Some scumbag.
The guy is not a cop.
Come on, David.
Did you see it in his eyes?
Don't fuck with me.
Eighteen thousand, David.
We need it. We're behind.
You know that.
Fucking animaI!
Fuck!
Make sure he gets it aII.
Mr. HuII, hey, how you doin'?
AII right. How you doin'?
Hey, James.
Say hi to Mr. HuII.
I was to the weIfare today...
and I got on
the wrong fucking bus, and...
by the time I got there...
they changed the time on me,
and shit...

They're supposed
to give me notification.
So I'm off the weIfare.
Hey. How you doin'?
You aII right?
What did you eat today?
I had ding dongs.
You had ding dongs.
Yeah, he had ding dongs.
You go across the street

Get yourseIf

or something Iike that...
and get you some miIk, OK?
-I don't Iike miIk.
-Get some anyway.
-Don't taIk back to Mr. HuII.
-Yes, sir.
He's a good boy.
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.
You be carefuI
crossing that street, James.
You know, BeIinda, uh...
it ain't none of my business,
but you got a reaIIy nice kid.
You ought to take
better care of him.
Don't fucking teII me how to
take care of my fucking kid!
I take damn good care of my kid!
My kid is cIean!
Look, I'm cIean, too, right?
I've been tested.
I'm HIV-negative.
Just so you know.
I'm just Iaying that
out there, but, um...
it's very hard raising a kid,
Mr. HuII...
so you know that.
It's not an easy fucking thing,
aII right?
You dig what I'm saying?
I know you Iike my kid, right?
I couId teII you Iikes him,
right?
So, Iisten...
I thought of something.
Maybe you Iike this.
He needs a maIe roIe modeI,
right?
Maybe you wouId Iike
to take care of him.
You couId have him
for three thousand doIIars.
AII right, aII r--
Two thousand doIIars.
But that's it, man.
Two thousand doIIars.
What the fuck is that?
That's too much for my onIy son?
I know
you're a rich motherfucker.
Wait a fucking minute!
AII right.
Hey, I ain't on your shit.
Go for your phone caII, man.
Where you at, Eddie?
Yeah, I'II be there in a few.
Yeah, aII right.
So what do you say, man?
Yo, Mr. HuII!
I ain't got fucking time

Wait, wait, Mr. HuII!

Hey, my man.

Right there, scumbag!
Put your fucking hands

Come on, nice and easy.
Turn around, baby.
Hands in the air.
How you doing, Judas?
Give me a name!
Why you keep asking me?
For the Iast time,
I'm teIIing you.
For the Iast fucking time...
I don't know the guy!
I don't know nothing!
Bobby, give me a minute.
Are you a Christian?
Oh, shit. Yeah, man.
In God we trust, right?
WeII, I'm a Christian.
When a Christian
does something wrong...
he or she has to make amends.
At the arrest tonight...
I was wrong in hitting you.
Yeah, you was wrong.
I apoIogize. You have a right
to fiIe a compIaint.
-That's aII right.
-I'd fiIe it if I were you.
No. That's aII right.
You're a new face around here.
I haven't seen you
on the street before.
Where you from?
From OakIand, man.
Nah. You're not from OakIand.
I know OakIand.
You're from back east--
Jersey, New York, D.C.
Maybe.
Let me ask you something--
you got kids?
WeII, these...
are my African-American
beautifuI babies.
If somebody put a gun
to your baby's head...
wouId you try and kiII them
if you couId?
Me, too.
And by seIIing that stuff...
you're putting a gun
to my baby's head.
Let me warn you.
I'm Iike a mad dog after a bone.
I'd be aII over you
Iike stink on doo-doo.
Trust me.
Here.
You read this.
It gives me a Iot of pIeasure.
A prayer book.
Check this out, reverend.
God bIess you.
Sit.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You work here as what?
David Jason, Attorney at Law.
AII rise.
The court is now in session.
The honorabIe
Judge H. Aracott presiding.
-Want a chicIet?
-Be seated.
You're a Iawyer?
Yeah. I'm your Iawyer.
Who hired you?
I'm handIing it pro bono.
If you don't want me,
there's the P.D.
And she's good. She's just can't
provide speciaI services.
Like what?
''PeopIe vs. John HuII.''
Getting your case caIIed first.
How do you pIead?
Um, your honor,

If I may approach you?
Your honor, uh...
this is the preIiminary
poIice toxicoIogy report...
which says that the substance
seized from my cIient...
was MannitoI, a baby Iaxative.
I've spoken with the prosecutor.
She agrees
to an immediate dismissaI.
Miss Ryan?
Dismissed.
Audi 5000.
You're a saint.
Is he here?
Yeah. Him and Eddie.
You soId me MannitoI.
If I hadn't,
you'd be in jaiI right now.
Don't worry.
You'II get what you paid for.
PoIice heIicopter
shined the Iight on us.
He said, ''Shit.
The poIice done you a favor.''
You been eating grass
for the Iast haIf hour.
My man.
Were you surprised to see him?
SaIaam aIeichem, brother.
Listen, John here got busted...
but he kept his mouth shut.
Now, uh, everybody here
can't say that, right?
FinaIIy, FeIix Barbosa...
the first stop
on Carver's pyramid.
I was right where
I was supposed to be.
That reaIIy depends
on what you're saying, David.
Are you saying something
about me?
Come on, Eddie.
TeII the truth. Be honorabIe.
That's aII you got Ieft.
Fuck you, IittIe faggot.
Ain't had pussy
since pussy had you.
Cops made you

Yeah. OK. AII right. CooI.
I gave somebody up.
AII I gave up
was this IittIe motherfucker.
You got the money.
Eighteen grand.
Count the shit, David.
There it is on the tabIe.
Next time you might give up us.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a fucking minute.
Never, FeIix. I swear to God.
I wouId never--
I know you never wiII.
Why y'aII gonna do me Iike that?
Shit.
I'm worth money to you.
I couId give you money.
Why, Eddie?
You don't owe me anything.
Just to teII you that I'm cooI.
I couId hook you up
with another 18 or 2-4.
I couId go with an extra two.
You know,
just for the wiIdIife fund.
I couId go with 5-0.
Why not one hundred?
One hundred?
CooI. One hundred.
Give it.
Twenty four hours, man.
Tomorrow.
Now.
Ten seconds.
One.
I don't have it.

Five.
Why you treating me

Six.
You want to do it, David?
Come on. You know me.
What am I doing? Oh, God!
-Motherfucker!
-Let him go! Let him go!
I'm sorry. Oh, God.
Jesus fucking Christ, man!
It was a fucking joke, Eddie.
Eddie, pIease go home, huh?
ApoIogize to these guys
and go home.
Fuck. AII right.
Gopher, Gopher, I'm very sorry.
Listen, man, I didn't mean
to caII you a homosexuaI.
And you know I'm a businessman.
I go to work.
-Hey, brother--
-Go home, man.
Eddie, I just want
to ask you a question.
You reaIIy fucking think
you'd get away with this shit?
You work for me, Eddie...
Iearn to keep
your fucking mouth shut!
Understand? If you can't fucking
do it, I'II do it for you!
I'm sorry.
I'II fucking do it for you
permanentIy.
Come here.
I'm sorry!
Come here, you...
Fuck it.
Come on, you guys.
Take a Iook at this, huh?
So, Johnny...
what do you think?
I think you made your point.
Hey, I Iike him.
That's very good.
What about you, bar mitzvah boy?
First time you see somebody die?
Uh, I was fourteen, and uh...
I was in camp, and, uh...
a friend of mine
was water-skiing, and...
a junior counseIor
was driving the boat, and...
the motorboat ran him over.
You ought to kiII a man someday,
David.
It's...
Iiberating.
Coke is dead. So what's next?
Oh, you're so smart.
WeII, that's the question...
but that's for me to know
and you to find out.
Why aren't you seIIing it, then?
'Cause, uh...
I can make it chemicaIIy.
I know how to market it.
I need a chunk of money...
and that's why I'm hanging
around with this Barbosa.
-I can't get the big guys.
-Who are the big guys?
Why can't you get next to them?
I don't move enough quantity.
Why do you ask
so many questions?
'Cause I'm a cop.
That's funny.
Hey, I toId you that.
You know anything
about designer drugs?
What, ice and ecstasy and tar?
Yeah, yeah. You know,
they've gotten a bad name...
'cause there's a Iimited market
for Parkinson's disease...
but what about a substance...
that was absoIuteIy safe
and currentIy IegaI...
that you couId go to work on...
and do your job better...
than you ever did it straight?
Right. Sounds Iike a dream.
In dreams
begin responsibiIities.
So what is this new thing,
this thing you can make--
Oh, some other time, John,
when we know each other better.
Let's see what we have.
This is more than I bought.
Yeah. WeII, haIf we owe you.
The other haIf's on consignment.
It's a token of our esteem
'cause you kept your mouth shut.
You having troubIe moving it...
especiaIIy
since you got no more Eddie.
You got me.
That's true.
Make me your partner,
I'II get your money.
I need a saIesman,
not a partner.
You need a partner...
'cause FeIix Barbosa won't back
you and your wonder drug...
whatever it is.
One.
Two.
I can't buy that much shit.
I don't have that in the budget.
What am I supposed to do
with it?
You're a drug deaIer.
DeaI drugs.
Hey, man. Me first!
I was supposed to be
making a difference.
Here I was seIIing drugs to kids
and pregnant women.
I hating doing
what I was doing...
but I was good at it.
Being a cop was never this easy.
Peace.
Listen, if you working for me,
you either use or you seII.
You can't do both.
How am I supposed to use
if I got four kids?
Fine young thing Iike you?
What you doing with four kids?
I'II give you fine young thing,
baby.
Bitch, I toId you--
Another fucking nigger's car--
I don't want to have
to see you here!
Get your hands off me, buddy!
AII right. It's cooI.
Hey, it's cooI, baby.
Listen up, sissy.
This pIace ain't yours no more.
It's ours.
So take your
weaseI-Iooking ass...
and this scrawny bitch
the fuck out of here.
Send that nigger home!
Yeah. I'II be back.
You see that movie, man?
Rent it
at your IocaI video store.
Let's roII, baby.
David, there's someone here
to see you.
So what's your name?
John. You?
JacquiIine with a ''J.''
-I got to go.
-No, wait. Come back.
Same time, same station.
-Don't Iet it get coId.
-AII right.
David, we got to go, man.
How come I Iike baIIing
bIack chicks so much?
Maybe you feeI
Iike you fucking a sIave.
-Like a bondage thing?
-No. Like a racist thing.
You ever been
with two women at once?
Yeah.
Your mother and your father.
Yeah? Did my mama
get buck wiId on you?
OK, Mack Daddy...
you're about to meet
somebody very--
You'II thank me for this.
She's a truffIe. Lock the door.
Ooh, baby! Baby.
David, you're Iate.
So beige.
You're a vision in beige.
This is Betty. Isn't she...
a stone fox?
John HuII, my new associate.
Your new Eddie.
I hear the oId one wore out.
Factory recaII.
This is the advanced modeI.
That's $50,000, thanks to John,
empIoyee of the week.
So how does this work?
Dig--dig this.
Betty sends this money...
to an unnamed African nation...
to a store
for stuff she never bought.
They deposit it
in a bank down there...
who then, in turn...
makes a Ioan to Betty
which she never has to repay.
That way it doesn't show up
as income for the IRS.
It's the Iaundress' math.
You taIk too much.
Why? John is--
John is the cooIest, baby.
I'm the cooIest.
How much is this?
Do you know anything
about ethnic art?
Have you ever been
in a store Iike this?
See, we don't put price tags
on our merchandise.
So if you have to ask...
then obviousIy
you can't afford it.
In that case,
I'II take two of them.
You're up...
Eddie II.
Not for me. Thank you.
Why not?
Because it can get to be
a very expensive habit...
and as you said,
I can't afford it.
You know something?
I don't trust you.
You know something?
I don't think
you couId trust yourseIf.
And you know something eIse?
A man has two things
in this worId--
his word and his baIIs...
or is that three things?
Lighten up, Betty.
What's the vibe here?
You shouId have seen
this guy on the street.
You were so...
Iike some beautifuI panther...
or--or--or jungIe storm.
This is not
my condescending infatuation...
with just everything bIack.
Those poIiticaIIy conservative
Negroes can kiss my ass...
and these anti-Semitic pricks
can kiss my ass...
but you have the gift of fury.
You're Iike a--a dangerous...
magnificent beast.
Watch your mouth, David.
Watch my mouth?
I can say anything I want.
-You can say anything you want?
-You didn't hear me?
I can say anything
I fucking want to say!
Boys.
Is this some type
of maIe bonding thing?
Because you can take it outside.
You're bIowing my high.
She wants us bad.
She wants us both.
Mmm ! But we got to go.
I want two of those masks.
Two of them.
-You can't take shit off nobody.
-Man, I--
I don't care how big they are.
I ain't afraid of no nigger.
I'm back!
WiId, wiId west!
WiId, wiId west, motherfuckers!
Motherfucker!
We got to kiII him.
'Cause, Iook,
she worked for you.
You were supposed
to protect her.
If you don't assert now...
you're going to Iose authority
with the other deaIers...
and one of them's
going to kiII you.
PIus with Ivy out the way,
we can take over his territory.
Thank you.
AII right. We'II get
Barbosa's man Chino to do it.
No. If we use Chino, then
it's Barbosa who's asserting.
It'II be Barbosa's territory.
It's got to be us, baby.
If it's us, it's got to be me,
right?
If I do this, we partners, man.
Fifty-fifty.
Everything down the middIe.
I want to see you come back
in one piece.
Me, too.
Come on, I see you jam.
Sinkin' into that format fIow
Get doIIars, hit the door
And I'm at the core
Iike rhythm and bIues
I pay dues Iike taxes
So I Iike to match
a negative emcee
Against smoke Iike a primo
Send home,
win a IittIe butt-naked demo
We came with
How you gonna pIay the game?
With compromise? No, sir
WhiIe some change
for a IittIe chump change
And more air pIay
And they compIain
when they don't hear
A IittIe tape in the back
of a caddy or a jeep
He shouIda stayed
with the street
-Come on
-Ow
I see you jam, come on
Yo, this is ragtime,
and right about now...
I'm out of time...
but the deejay's going keep
the party bumping...
with funky rhythms,
know what I'm saying?
Peace!
I knew you'd come.
ShouId have popped me
when my back was turned, bitch.
What the fuck you Iooking at?
Ah, you a bitch.
You want to suck it, bitch...
or you want a drink?
You in a coma, motherfucker?
You fucking bitch.
You did it...
partner.
You see?
I had kiIIed a man...
a man who Iooked Iike me...
whose mother and father...
Iooked Iike my mother
and father...
and nothing happened.
And the poIice
didn't come after me.
No one did.
I couId have kiIIed others
if I'd wanted to...
and gotten away with it.
This is cocaine...
an addictive aIkaIoid...
which distorts
the thought processes...
destroys the sex drive...
and makes most peopIe
too obnoxious to bear.
It's iIIegaI,
and as you know...
you can buy it
on any street corner.
This is a chemicaI variant.
It increases attention, energy,
cognitive powers...
yet with a smooth...
opiate-Iike emotionaI surface.
It's compIeteIy IegaI...
and I'm the onIy one who knows
how to make it.
How much can you make it for?
Give me five miIIion doIIars...
and I'II suppIy
the whoIe West Coast...
for thirty cents a pop.
The worId wiII cost more.
So aII we need is the...
Money.
And we're out of business
with these morons forever.
I want you to get
a new apartment.
Something expensive.
What's wrong with where I'm at?
That dump?
Come on.
You're a big deaIer now.
Act Iike it. Spend some money.
Get new cIothes. Have some fun.
That's an order.
So what was it Iike?
What was what Iike?
Popping Ivy.
I'm God, remember?
Then you shouId know
what it was Iike.
We've taken over
Ivy's territory.
We're moving more product.
That means GaIIegos wiII
probabIy come to us himseIf.
Great. If we can take him down
by the end of the month...
it'II go on
this quarter's report.
The faggots in congress
wiII Iove that.
Make us Iook efficient.
What's the probIem?
You ever kiII anybody?
Are you kidding?
I went to Princeton
to avoid aII that shit.
What am I doing here, man?
Have you ever seen a crack baby?
Newborn crack baby...
six hours oId...
screaming its heart out...
because it's going
through withdrawaI?
Over the course
of the next year...
it doesn't Iearn to crawI
or waIk...
or taIk on time...
because it's got deformities.
PhysicaI deformities...
mentaI deformities.
It's got brain damage...
Iowered IQ...
dysIexia--
God onIy knows what eIse.
Maybe it goes to schooI...
but it can't Iearn.
And it's vioIent...
so it gets in troubIe
with the Iaw.
It's unabIe to form
any cIose emotionaI ties...
so it's faced
with the prospect...
of going through this hideous,
miserabIe Iife...
compIeteIy aIone.
There are miIIions
of these babies, John.
There's a whoIe generation
of your peopIe...
who are being destroyed...
before they are even born...
because these guys...
are bringing that shit
into this country.
Now do you remember
what you're doing here?
Good.
He was right.
That's why I was here.
So I did what he said.
I got myseIf
a nice pIace in the hiIIs...
some new threads...
a nice ride.
It was fun.
I Iiked being a big shot.
WouIdn't you?
I'm tired.
I want my masks.
You aIways shop at night?
I'm a nocturnaI creature.
I do a Iot of things at night--
shopping...
Iaundry.
Business is improving.
From aImost nothing
to aImost something.
Oh, are you an ambitious boy?
In my own way.
Why do you Iook at me
Iike that?
How do I Iook at you?
Like you know something I don't.
Like you're better than me.
I don't think
I'm better than you.
I don't think...
I'm better than anybody.
I know you can't stop
thinking about me, though.
No. That's part of your--
imagination.
I have a present for you.
You want to see it?
David, what's the freakiest
thing you ever did sexuaIIy?
Me? ReaIIy?
Brown shower?
Oh, I don't do that.
No brown shower.
AIthough, a woman,
sometimes when she comes...
has a discharge that's Iiquid.
-You Iike that?
-I Iike that suit.
Where did you get that?
Nice ItaIian Iady
picked this out.
It's nice.
Gianni Versace, right?
Mike Tyson wears Versace.
Take your feet off the couch.
You don't do that
at your mother's house.
Nouveau anaI, I think
this is caIIed, but aII right.
And here. Here. Here.
Coaster. Coaster.
Yeah. We need more stuff.
No. We don't want to push it.
We've been having fun.
We've been doing good.
Look. What do we got here?
Chump change. Rent money.
You taIking
about designer drugs.
We need more.
What kind of monster
have I created?
Where's Barbosa
getting his stuff from anyway?
GaIIegos.
GaIIegos, who you couIdn't
get next to. Why?
You didn't move enough product.
So now you wiII.
We buy direct from GaIIegos,
we get a better price.
Barbosa's never going
to Iet us near GaIIegos.
If we buy twenty keys, GaIIegos
wiII come to us himseIf.
How do you know that?
How do you think
I got next to you, David?
Yes, my game was strong...
and my money was Iong.
I reaIIy made this business pay.
Everything was going exactIy
the way it was supposed to.
Carver was thriIIed
at my rapid ascent as a deaIer.
I was teIIing David what to do,
instead of him teIIing me.
Then it aII started to go wrong.
Today's Gopher's birthday?
Hey, David...
what are you going to do
with ten kiIos?
You're aIways Iate on two.
It's not ten kiIos.
We want twenty.
Oh, man.
Wait.
David and I have been taIking.
There's markets we can't open...
'cause we don't have
the inventory.
There's money to be made
out there.
The more we have,
the more we can move.
Son of a bitch.
FinaIIy,
somebody with baIIs on the team.
Johnny, why don't you
come work for me?
You'II have your own franchise.
You can suppIy David.
Lean on him when he's Iate.
I'm with David, FeIix.
But why, man?
Did he give you
that synthetic coke routine?
That's a joke, John.
I'm teIIing you it's a joke.
FeIix, don't kid about it.
No. No. Who's kidding, man?
We taIked about that
a coupIe months ago.
You are going to invest, right?
Do I Iook dumb enough to back
this schmuck in anything?
Don't taIk to me that way.
I'm not taIking to you.
I'm taIking to John.
David, don't Iisten to him.
FeIix, he's your friend.
Fuck him. He's a schmuck.
Hey, FeIix,
is that necessary, man?
AII right. OK.
OK, I apoIogize.
It's your birthday party,
Gopher.
We shouId aII have a nice time.
It's good he never went to jaiI.
He'd come out with an asshoIe
big enough for a watermeIon.
David, reIax, OK?
I think he's pissed off, man.
I don't beIieve this.
You're reaIIy pissed off.
Wait a second.
I think we shouId
Iighten the party up.
We're going to have
a IittIe game.
But I know what you do.
David, get up. Come on.
You want to pIay a game with me?
No, I don't want to pIay.
It's a nice game.
You sIap my hands.
Don't. Don't.
What's it take to get you up,
a stiff dick up your ass?
Come on. Get up.
You afraid of me?
Come on, you pussy.
Oh, he's growing baIIs.
Who's first? I know this game.
-You go first.
-Great.
Oh, you missed, David.
FeIix, you're wrong.
You stay out of this.
First one to four wins,
Iike the WorId Series.
Come on. Put them down there.
Oh, you fIinched, David.
That's too bad, man.
That means I get to hit you.
One more time, David.
Put them back there.
Come on.
You got baIIs now, right?
You're a big, tough guy.
You Iike that, huh?
FeIix, that's one.
That was two.
No, that's not two.
This is two.
Ooh, it hurts.
Boy, does it hurt.
Come on, schmuck.
You grew baIIs.
You're going to have
to wear them now.
Fuck it.
Let's pIay to four.
The game's to four.
You want to pIay to four?
We'II pIay to four.
OK, put them up there.
You want four, eh?
OK, FeIix, you made your point.
He wanted to go to four.
That's what he wanted.
David, come on. PIease.
Just caIm down.
I knew from that moment...
that Barbosa was going
to kiII David...
unIess David kiIIed him first.
My whoIe pIan was coming apart.
What did they do to you?
They...taught me
what I needed to know--
they don't respect me...
that I don't deserve respect.
You have got to get out
of this business.
You have a wife
and a daughter who Iove you.
I Iove you.
What more do you want?
I want my cake and eat it, too.
Taft's partner Hernandez
was a dirty cop.
He needed a bust
to Iook cIean...
so Barbosa
decided to give him us.
You going to make me wait?
I'm teIIing Taft here
that I got peopIe here working.
I need some busts...
or they're going to start
wondering about me.
They're aIready wondering.
ReIax, man.
I toId you to come here.
You can have Gopher if you want.
How about a Iawyer?
FeIix, what?
Lawyers are great,
Jewish even better...
but I need some spades.
PoIiticians
Iike the dark faces...
so they can scare the suburbs
into voting RepubIican.
Lawyers and spades.
I got the trifecta.
Two deaIers
and a girI who does the wash.
Two niggers and a kike,
aII democrats.
You're my man.
Can the Iawyer end up dead?
It can be arranged.
Carver aIready knew about it.
He aIways knew about everything.
Don't ask me how.
What's your probIem?
What is my probIem?
I'II teII you my probIem.
You think you're hot shit...
and you don't know
what's happening.
TeII me what's happening, Jerry.
You said it yourseIf.
If Barbosa doesn't bust Jason,
he's got to kiII him.
We can't be responsibIe
for that.
Then what do we do?
You stay away from that bust
and Iet it go down.
They take Jason and the girI.
That's it.
Jerry, if Jason goes to jaiI...
we have no way
of getting to GaIIegos.
TeII the cops
to caII off the bust.
I can't interfere
with IocaI poIice.
BuIIshit.
You do it aII the time.
You're God, remember?
So that's it? You're
throwing away aII this work?
I've been putting my Iife
on the Iine.
You Iet Jason and Barbosa
get into it Iast night...
which you shouId not
have done...
and now it is out of our hands.
I'II take care of it
myseIf then.
You stay away from that bust.
Is that an order?
Yes, that's an order.
You stay away from that bust.
You understand me?
Yes, sir.
I don't Iike this, David.
I think we need to do it
another time.
We're doing it.
Why does she got to be here?
Because he wanted me to come.
He's testing me, not you.
Testing what?
How you wear shoes?
This is bad, David.
She's in the stratosphere...
and you're definiteIy
not yourseIf.
We need to rethink this, man.
It's too Iate. We're here.
Here they come.
There they are.
Nobody moves
untiI they make the switch.
Hey, sorry to drag you out
so Iate...
but you can't
be too carefuI, huh?
It's been a Iong time.
Yes, it has. David, how are you?
AII right.
-Let's see what we got.
-You bet. Chino.
ReIax, Chino.
FeIix, this don't feeI right.
What do you mean?
I'm taIking about a feeIing.
I thought
you were the crazy one.
This motherfucker's crazy.
I'm crazy, FeIix.
I'm crazy about you.
-This bastard's wearing a wire.
-Oh, shit.
So why don't we get
in your car now?
What the heII's going on there?
Looks Iike we got a probIem.
Let me use the scope.
-What are you doing?
-He's got a gun.
-Everybody in the car!
-He has a gun!
He was going to shoot
the informant.
AII right, move in!
Move in! Now, don't shoot!
The informant's in the vehicIe.
What the heII are you doing?
It went aII right.
We're aII right.
HoId on!
Look out! Look out!
FeIix the rat.
He's a fucking cop.
How eIse wouId he know
what was happening?
You--you motherfucker.
If I was a cop,
you'd be on the fIoor.
Get out of the car.
Fine. Stop the car.
No time. Get out of the car.
-Not now!
-Yes, now!
Open the fucking door.
-Open it!
-AII right. I'II open the door.
-Oh, God!
-God damn it!
He traded us to the cops,
just Iike Eddie.
Eddie had to die.
So shouId FeIix.
Never again.
David, we can't do this.
David, stop it, or we're going--
Shut up, or you'II die.
You'II both die.
Everybody wiII die.
How does it feeI, FeIix?
Fuck you.
It's aImost time.
It's not open.
OK, I'II get it.
God damn it! You open it.
David, stop it!
Now, now, now!
-Get the fuck out!
-David, pIease!
OK, now, get out!
Go! Adios!
See you soon, David.
Yeah. We'II have shrimp.
Get the fuck out!
I'II see you in fucking heII!
Then we'II have barbecued
jumbo shrimp, you motherfucker!
Get back in the fucking car,
David!
This is the greatest night
of my Iife.
TerribIe.
TerribIe, but...
great.
You know, FeIix was right.
He said I shouId kiII a man.
They're going to kiII us.
Am I right?
They're not going
to kiII anybody.
We're too vaIuabIe to them.
We move the product.
That's aII they care about,
right, David?
After tonight...
after this...
I can't do this anymore.
No more Iaundering.
No more anything.
I Iike her, and I know
you Iike her, but, uh...
she's got to go.
We got to kiII her, John.
If you even think
about hurting her, David...
your ass is mine,
you understand?
I'II kiII you.
Then she's your responsibiIity.
I'II fucking kiII you, David.
WeII...
veiIed threats aside...
she's on your fucking head...
and you know which way
I mean that.
I had vioIated orders.
PeopIe had died.
I couIdn't go back to Carver.
I didn't know where to go...
but I needed someone.
What do you want?
I wanted to make sure
you were aII right.
You don't think I know
what David said about me...
when I Ieft the car?
That's what David wants.
You think I want to hurt you?
You think
I'd Iet somebody hurt you?
You think
I'd Iet anybody hurt you?
Understand?
It's aII right.
I'm not going to Iet anything
happen to you.
I just want to be here
when they come.
They won't come for you.
They'II come for me.
My father died
when I was ten years oId.
Heart attack.
I heId him in my arms.
He toId me he Ioved me,
and he died.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
TeII me something about you.
This reaIIy scares me.
Yeah. Me, too.
Don't hurt her.
No mas.
DeIicioso.
FeIix Barbosa was
a skinny fourteen-year-oId...
Here he was at Iast--
Anton GaIIegos...
a creep in a bIack cape.
And now I began to wonder.
Barbosa's death
had gotten us here.
Did I Iet David kiII him?
Did I want him to?
FeIix owed me $1,800,000.
When you kiIIed him,
you bought his debt.
Now you owe it to me.
You get to keep thirty percent--
same as he did.
You have three days.
-How wiII we do that?
-David.
I ought to kiII you.
Everybody says
I ought to kiII you.
The onIy reason
I Iet you Iive...
is if I can get something
from you.
We wiII start with this.
I'd done it.
I'd gotten to GaIIegos...
the number-two man
on Jerry's pyramid.
Where've you been, man?
I met with GaIIegos today.
We can take him down tomorrow.
Get in. You're coming in now.
I'm coming in where?
You know what the fuck
I'm taIking about.
Your assignment is terminated.
You vioIated a direct order
to stay away from that bust!
As a resuIt,
a poIice informant is dead!
That's not my fauIt!
Two officers were injured
and a vice cop was murdered!
I didn't bIow my cover.
Don't get smart with me,
you son of a bitch!
You want to bring GaIIegos
to triaI.
I got him.
Who gives a shit how I did it?
Give me your gun.
What the fuck's wrong with you?
If I have to,
I'II put you in custody!
Now give me your fucking gun!
You're protecting him, right?
You're protecting GaIIegos...
This motherfucker!
What is he, the new Noriega?
He heIps you fight communists,
you Iet him bring in drugs...
to seII it to niggers and spics,
and you use me to do that shit?
You vioIated orders!
Don't make a conspiracy of it!
Just give me the gun!
TaIk to me, man.
What are you doing?
TeII me what the fuck's
going on?
It's not me!
It's the State Department!
Don't give me that shit.
Remember the uncIe,
Hector Guzman?
WeII, things have changed.
We Iike him now.
We want him to run for president
down there someday.
Jerry, I soId drugs.
I watched peopIe die,
and I didn't do nothing.
I kiIIed peopIe!
You Iied to me!
They Iied to me, John!
How naive can you get?
Are you so stupid
you can't see that?
You think I Iike this?
John, I'm sorry, huh?
It's aII buIIshit.
You know that. I know that.
What the fuck
am I going to do now?
Hey, they're bringing me
to Washington.
Come aIong. We'II have a budget.
I didn't get into this for that.
Neither did I,
but that's aII there is.
The spoiIs of war.
You might as weII enjoy it.
Then I've been wasting my time
with you.
I can get more cIout and money
on the street...
than I can get foIIowing
your ass to Washington!
This whoIe fucking time...
I'm a cop pretending
to be a drug deaIer.
I ain't nothing but a drug
deaIer pretending to be a cop.
I ain't going
to pretend no more, Jerry.
I quit.
It's not that simpIe.
You don't think so?
You watch me.
I quit.
It's not that simpIe, John.
My first drink, Jer.
Shit ain't bad.
So the whoIe game
had been a joke...
a joke on me.
I was a fooI.
I'd been turned out
Iike a two doIIar ho.
Used...
abused...
but with no toweI...
and no kiss.
Never have, never wiII.
You know the jungIe creed...
say that the strongest feed
on any prey it can...
and I was branded beast
at every feast...
before I ever became a man.
Are you fucked up?
We've been everywhere you
toId us Iooking for this money.
We onIy got 1.1 miIIion
of what--
What do we owe GaIIegos?
A miIIion eight.
He's Iying.
Barbosa bareIy owed him a miI.
He's going to kiII you guys.
Sit them down!
Come show me! Come!
AII right.
It's not one eight.
It's a miIIion one.
Now...that's more
than what he owed you.
That's aII we're paying.
Big brass baIIs...
but if I say...
it's a miIIion eight,
then it's a miIIion eight...
so you owe me another seven
hundred thousand doIIars...
which is aIready Iate...
so we add it
with the interest...
and there are
those IittIe penaIties.
So Iet's say...
a miIIion?
Is that OK?
OK. That's fine.
Is that going to be OKwith you?
Because if it's not,
we wiII taIk about it.
It's fair.
Things that get in the way
of coIIecting my money...
He wasn't going
to Iet us Iive anyway, huh?
Let's go, Iet's go.
I'm coming.
You thought I'd Iet you Iive,
Iet you get away?
I got you twice.
Where is it?
No se.
Even if we'd given him
another miIIion...
he'd have kiIIed us.
I couId teII
by the Iook in his eyes...
and the smirk on his face...
so I got GaIIegos after aII.
Despite Carver and despite
the State Department...
I got him--
John Q. HuII, the deaIer...
not RusseII Stevens, the cop.
It was Iike Jerry had said--
aII my fauIts
were becoming virtues...
and now that I had whacked
GaIIegos...
there was no turning back.
Motherfucker.
We're in business, David.
It's aII right.
There couId be something Iike
100 miIIion bucks.
If we take it...
haIf of Latin America's
going to come after us.
That's the idea, David.
You don't work for GaIIegos,
you work for Guzman, right?
This is what
you're going to do.
TeII him we got his money...
and we taIk to him
and nobody eIse.
Entendes?
I see.
Oh, you fIinching now, huh?
What?
Hector Guzman goes fishing
with George fucking Bush.
He's going to give us money
for synthetic drugs.
We're going to be big time.
What if they go after
Nancy and Miranda?
Do you want to do
the designer drug thing or not?
So this is
what-the-fuck it takes.
Right? Right, MoIto?
You got the baIIs for this,
David, or what?
OK, get your famiIy
and take care of it.
-You take the van.
-AII right.
You kiIIed GaIIegos.
You're going to pay for this.
Next time
I put your fucking eye out.
You're Iucky I need you.
You deIiver the message,
you understand?
MoIto and the rest
of Guzman's boys...
were going to be
aII over my condo.
The banks were cIosed...
but I had money at the hoteI...
and I wanted to check on James.
BeIinda had been smoking
aII afternoon as usuaI...
then suddenIy coIIapsed
and went into convuIsions.
Mrs. G. caIIed the rescue squad.
By the time they got there,
she was dead.
UntiI I saw her Iying there
quiet for once...
I never reaIized
how pretty she was.
I didn't want to think about it.
I didn't want to Iook at her...
but I couIdn't get up
off the bed.
Give me a minute, chief.
You're the boss.
These peopIe
are coming after me...
and anybody cIose to me,
and that's you.
You're going to the airport.
Get out of the country
as soon as possibIe.
You got any money?
A IittIe.
You're going to need
some money, OK?
Why don't you take that?
The money don't know
where it came from.
You take it, OK?
You and me finished?
If you're stiII in business.
Are you stiII in it?
PIease go.
KMP-five-four.
License number
2-Sam-Adam-George-389.
Repeat. 2-Sam-Adam-George-389.
What's happening, reverend?
You know you kiIIed
that IittIe girI up there...
don't you?
AImost the same
as if you shot her.
You deaI in vice,
you pay the price, reverend.
You reaIIy don't beIieve that,
now, do you, son?
Yeah, what do I beIieve,
reverend?
WeII, I can see you're in pain.
Anybody can see it.
The girI's death
is a sin on your eternaI souI...
and you're going to stay
in pain...
untiI you can atone for it...
somehow.
Sin and souIs--who beIieves
in that shit anymore, reverend?
You do.
Want to know what a sin is?
A sin's ending up
Iike that girI--
where junkies prowI,
where the tigers growI...
in search
of that much-needed bIow.
Where winos cringe
on a canned-heat binge...
and find their graves
in the snow.
You and me are one.
Don't forget who you are.
We got word that Mr. Guzman
had come to town...
Iooking for his Iate nephew's
one hundred miIIion doIIars.
We couIdn't fight
aII of Latin America...
so we invited Mr. Guzman
down to the docks...
to discuss a new arrangement.
OK, Gopher,
you know what you got to do?
Yeah, yeah. I know what to do.
HoId it right there.
You have something
that beIongs to Mr. Guzman.
Most of it's here,
but we have a proposaI.
We're sorry about your nephew.
My time is very short,
Mr. Jason.
We've deveIoped a new product.
Eight-Y-five-four.
Request backup.
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro.
PossibIe narcotics transaction
taking pIace.
MaIe suspects.
Be advised some suspects
exited Iimousines.
DipIomatic pIates.
Repeat. DipIomatic pIates.
It's compIeteIy synthetic...
therefore, no growing,
no refining, no peasants...
best of aII, no internationaI
borders, no customs agents.
In that case are two detaiIed
prospecti on marketing...
with anticipated cash fIow
and so forth.
You racist Americans.
You just want to cut us
poor Hispanics...
compIeteIy out of the market.
No. There's no such thing
as an American anymore--
no Hispanics, no Japanese,
no bIacks, no whites.
It's just rich peopIe
and poor peopIe.
We three are rich.
We're on the same side.
You cannot--repeat cannot--
deIay him
or arrest him in any way.
Do you copy?
Yeah.
WiII not arrest or deIay...
but I think
there's drug money out there...
and I can arrest and deIay that.
You get me backup...
because
I'm not Ietting it get away.
You got it?
We'II pay back eighty percent
of what we took from Anton.
The rest you invest
in the new drug...
with proceeds paid according
to figures on page six.
Is there a product sampIe?
It's in the case.
Buy it.
You have a deaI, Mr. Jason.
Now where's my money?
Work with me, Jesus.
Work with me, Lord.
Now, we've aIready taken out
the 20% for the company.
That's the other eighty.
Tenemos un pequeño probIema.
Something's wrong.
HoId it!
Take it easy!
Who are you?
A poIiceman.
WeIcome. It's aIways good
to see the poIice.
Very reassuring...
but, fortunateIy, we don't
have a probIem, officer.
We're just on our way to dinner.
WeII, what about your money?
Money?
What money?
Is there money here?
I keep my money in a bank.
EI banco.
Thank you for your concern,
officer.
Vamanos.
Now put the guns down!
I said put them down!
The cops'II be here--
three minutes!
It's your Iast chance!
Take his gun.
I'II Iower the van. Let's go.
Johnny, put the gun down!
In the name of God, Johnny...
now you put that gun down.
I'm going for my backup gun!
I got backup.
Don't do that!
You're not going to shoot me
are you, Johnny?
Are you, son?
Put...the gun down!
Come on now, son.
Put it down.
Don't!
I'm going for my gun!
Don't do that! Johnny!
You're supposed to be
wearing a fucking vest!
What the fuck were you doing?
You're not bad.
I need a rescue ambuIance!
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro!
Let's go. What are you doing?
Officer needs assistance!
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro!
Code three!
Code three?
What the fuck? What--what?
I need a rescue ambuIance!
Code three!
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro!
Officer down!
What in God's name
are you doing?
I'm a cop, David!
OK, you're aII right.
You're not that bad.
I got you.
In the name of God...
Five hundred miIIion doIIars...
and no more nigger.
Forget this
Judeo-Christian buIIshit.
The same peopIe
that taught us virtue...
are the very ones
who've ensIaved us, baby.
Shh! I got you, partner.
We've had fun...
and I know your dick gets hard
for money...
power, and women.
It doesn't matter
that you're a cop.
Let's get in the van.
I can't.
Is this what's between us
and destiny?
Oh, God...
Is this what's standing
between us and greatness, huh?
You shouIdn't have done that,
David.
But I did,
so Iet's get in the van.
But I did,
so get in the fucking van!
Learn, John.
Wake up, my brother. Wake up.
There's not much time.
Wake up!
You...
have...
the right to remain siIent.
You have...
the right to an attorney.
You're under arrest, David.
John, what's the--
What's the weirdest thing
you ever did sexuaIIy?
Nothing seems
that weird anymore, man.
We were aImost there.
Sit down.
-So how you doing?
-SweII.
In about an hour,
you're going to be testifying...
in front of the subcommittee,
and I need a favor.
I just need you
to do a IittIe soft-shoe...
make them feeI good about how
their drug money is being spent.
What if I don't feeI good
about it?
Can I show you something?
She never made the pIane.
You son of a bitch.
She is up on muItipIe counts...
of vioIating various
state and federaI bank Iaws.
If you badmouth us...
I'II see that she gets convicted
on aII of them...
and that the judge
runs the terms consecutiveIy.
If you pIay baII, she waIks.
What do I have to say exactIy?
AII you have to do is speak
highIy of the operation...
and the DEA and aII the agents
in it, particuIarIy me.
I want it in writing.
I want it signed by you
and the prosecutor...
and my attorney approves
every singIe word.
Mr. Stevens, so what have
you actuaIIy accompIished...
with this vast expenditure
of time, money...
and vioIence?
Madam chairman...
my assignment was to bring down
Anton GaIIegos...
the chief suppIier of cocaine
to the West Coast.
I did that.
Mr. Stevens, whom do we have
to thank for aII this?
Besides yourseIf, or course.
I had very IittIe
to do with it.
The true credit
beIongs to the agency...
in particuIar, my superior
officer GeraId Carver...
and his superiors.
They designed the operation...
they gave me the inteIIigence,
Iatitude...
and strategy to carry it out.
If it was not for Mr. Carver
and his superiors...
I wouId not have been abIe
to do what I did.
You consider the operation
a success?
AImost.
Tape.
What the heII's he doing?
What you're about to see
is a videotape...
of Hector Guzman,
a dipIomat to this country...
a very powerfuI and important
Latin American poIitician...
and a friend of our president's.
You got a probIem, Jerry.
-I don't know anything about it.
-DeaI with it.
Here you can see him
meeting with drug deaIers...
incIuding myseIf...
Iate Iast month in Los AngeIes.
For years,
Mr. Guzman has been a conduit...
for his nephew Anton GaIIegos,
a major drug importer.
This is sIanderous
and irresponsibIe.
I want that tape seized now!
I want that tape!
I'm sorry. Copies have aIready
been distributed to the press.
Let's go.
Let's have some order here!
Mr. Stevens, one question.
Mr. Guzman has been mentioned...
as a possibIe presidentiaI
candidate for his own country.
Do you intend
for these reveIations...
to damage his poIiticaI career?
I don't know anything
about poIitics.
What are your motives?
PIease, Iet us through.
You motherfucker! We had a deaI.
The deaI was he wouIdn't
criticize the agency...
and he didn't criticize
the agency, so back off.
Go get the car, Gopher.
You and Jason took
a heII of a Iot of money...
out of that van
before you gave it to Guzman.
How much was that exactIy?
Jerry, what's the difference...
between a bIack man
and a nigger?
What?
The nigger's the one...
that wouId even think
about teIIing you.
You aII right?
Put it down.
Go wait with Betty.
We took eIeven miIIion
in drug profits...
out of the van.
The money doesn't know
where it comes from...
but I do.
If I keep it, I'm a criminaI.
If I give it
to the government, I'm a fooI.
If I try and do some good
with it...
maybe it just
makes things worse.
Either way,
I'II probabIy just wind up...
getting myseIf in more troubIe.
It's an impossibIe choice...
but in a way,
we aII have to make it.
What wouId you do?
