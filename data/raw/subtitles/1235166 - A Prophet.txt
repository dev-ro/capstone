Take off these cuffs!
Think you can shut me up?
Fuck you!
Remove the cuffs, fag!
I'll remember you, fags!
Easy.
Don't touch me.
Raise your hands.
Fuck you, asshole!
Where are you taking me?
First, take off the handcuffs.
Take them off or I'm not coming in.
You think I'm stupid?
Take off the handcuffs!
Mali, can you hear me?
- Do you understand?
- I understand it's 6 years.
Now you're an adult.
You'll be in a prison.
You're among the adults.
Sign here.
- What's this?
- For legal aid.
- Money?
- Money for me.
So they pay me. Sign here.
Money for you?
Thank you.
Raise your arms.
Higher.
Palms out.
Shake your hair.
Open your mouth.
Stick out your tongue.
Turn.
The soles of your feet.
The other one.
Bend over.
Cough.
Money is not allowed here.
You'll get it when you leave.
Give him a uniform and shoes.
Rubbish. You can't wear them here.
- Do you have a family?
- No, sir.
- Somebody to send you money?
- No, sir.
Friends or enemies in here?
No, sir.
You'll be in observation.
So we can evaluate you.
We'll see how you adapt.
Then you'll have a permanent cell.
- Are you a practicing believer?
- What?
Your religion.
Will you pray?
Any special diet?
Nothing special, sir.
Do you eat pork?
No. Yes...
How will you receive any money sent?
I don't know.
Want to work?
- What do you do besides attacking
policemen? - I did nothing!
Vocational training?
Anything else?
Stand back, please.
Boss!
Are you new?
You're in the office.
Did you get something from outside?
- A mobile, drugs, pills?
- What the hell? I have nothing.
Do you get checks?
Do you have friends outside?
- What do you want?
-Your shoes. They're nice.
Can I keep them?
Take my slippers.
Fuck you.
Faggot!
Son of a bitch.
To your cells. Closing time.
Closing time.
Line up.
Cesar.
Call Cesar.
The guy on the right.
- What's that dirty Arab doing here?
- Could be for the Farraldo trial.
Luciani. Ward.
Luciani. Consultation.
So?
They've brought him
for the Farraldo trial.
His lawyer wants to negotiate.
Get a lesser sentence.
He will stay until the trial.
Jacky Marcaggi wants you to do him.
- When is the trial?
- On the 14.
In 10 days? Not much time.
- Does he suspect anything?
- The usual.
Like anyrat. He's asked for a
transfer to the Muslim section.
And if left alone,
we lose our chance.
Stays all day in the cell. Doesn't see
anyone. Never goes out. Doesn't eat.
He requested block B,
with the Muslims.
We have to get him
while he's in the cell.
- Hit and run?
- We can't risk one of our own.
Stay tuned. We'll find a
way. Any contact in block A?
Just the porter.
Open. Dinner!
- The door must always be open.
-Yes, I know.
- Nothing to eat? - No, just bread.
- Bread, then.
The other.
Bon appétit.
- When is there mail?
-Tomorrow.
- How you doing?
- Okay.
Bread?
Bon appétit.
- What the fuck?
- I recognized you. We're neighbors.
- What's your name?
-Yours?
- Which block are you in?
- Do you know yours?
B.
Ask for the B.
It is for our brothers.
Come closer.
I said come closer.
You want hashish?
Yeah, hashish. Want some or not?
But... I have no money.
-We'll manage.
- What do you mean?
I'll bribe a guard and you suck me.
- What? -You suck me off.
- Fuck you, asshole!
Me, suck? Motherfucker! Fuck you!
Shut up! Faggot!
Are you okay?
I found it in the yard.
This way.
- How old are you?
- 19. Why?
- Don't look at me. Look at this guy.
- Look at me.
I heard you got 6 years.
It's a long time.
Think you can last
without protection?
I'll manage.
- What do you want?
-To protect you.
- Do you speak Arabic?
- Sure.
The guy in the shower yesterday...
You know him?
What did he want?
To talk.
I told you not to look at me.
I want you to go on with him.
Get close to him.
Become his friend.
Why?
Because you're going to kill him.
Let him go.
Come closer.
Closer. Near to him.
You can do it.
You're not alone.
We'll help.
But remember something.
Now that you know, either you kill him,
or I'll kill you.
Go on, now.
Understood?
Kill him and be quiet. Understood?
I can't kill anyone.
- Yes?
- Can I speak with the director?
There is a procedure.
First you have to ask for an interview.
The guard...
Can I talk to the guard now?
- Why?
- I need to.
I'll check.
I have a problem, sir.
We give the orders. What do you want?
Nothing? Shut up and do as you're told.
Reyeb is careful.
He won't accept easily.
Are you listening?
- Once again. Are you paying attention?
-Yes
It won't be easy.
You can't carry anything.
Talk to him... naturally.
About your mothers, visits...
Normal talk.
You cut here.
You hit him on the balls.
You grab his shoulder.
You get up and do it. Understood?
Can you give me some hash?
I can't hear you.
Some hash.
Ok. I'll talk to the dealer.
Move away.
What?
Move away, I said.
Turn.
Turn.
Raise your hands.
Guard!
Is it that one?
- El Djebena, move.
- Give us a minute.
Problems at work?
- What did he do?
- He hit a guy.
Did you hit a guy?
What did he do to you?
Nothing?
Nothing and you hit him?
You know what I think?
You did that to get caught.
Am I wrong?
You think we can't get to you
to do what we want?
Is that it?
Bitch!
Piece of shit!
Asshole!
Enough, Cesar!
Stop, Cesar! Enough!
He'll bleed a lot, so be careful.
Check the soles of your shoes.
Leave the blade in his hand.
Your turn. You're the girl.
Fast or it won't work.
Come on.
That's right. Fine.
Come on.
Come in. Don't move.
Raise your hands.
I said hands up.
Sorry, but not everyone
is a friend here.
I decide.
Sit.
On the bed.
On the bed I said.
You want something?
Water? Coffee?
Coffee.
- Are you interested in this?
- What? - Books.
-You want to read?
- I don't know.
Don't know what?
You can't read, right?
it's never too late.
There is a school in prison.
You can learn here.
Sugar?
The idea is to get out of here
a little smarter.
Here.
I've seen you in the yard.
Always alone.
Always wearing the same clothes.
Don't you have friends here? None?
I'm just passing by. I won't stay.
I can leave you some books.
You can learn to read.
Shut up!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
What are you doing?
Come.
From Cesar Luciani.
You are now under his protection.
I have seen your profile.
Almost empty.
Are you interested?
Why didn't you fill it out, then?
- I don't understand.
- Want to learn?
You wrote your name, so
you can write a little.
A little.
- When did you leave school?
- At age 11.
Can you write "In" and "out"?
Is your mother tongue French?
Did you talk in French
or Arabic to your parents?
- I wasn't raised by them.
- Did you speak French or Arabic first?
Both.
- Where was your school?
- A Youth Center.
There is a word with "a"
which is not pronounced "a".
The 4th.
- The 4th. What is the word?
- "Dans".
Go to the 2nd word.
The 2nd word...
"Canard".
This word has 2 syllables.
Ca...
nard.
Repeat, separating the syllables.
Very good.
In the first syllable, "ca", is the "a"
at the beginning or the end?
Happy birthday, brother.
1 year
Stop it!
Have you no shame?
Who are the leaders?
-You know them?
- Who?
The Muslims.
These fucking Arabs! Dogs
at least screw in silence.
3.40 Euros.
How much is that?
In francs?
Money is money.
20 francs?
Pass the biscuits.
- Can you buy me something?
-You cheated me the last time.
- Not true.
- Ask him.
- What do you want?
- Soap, cereal and Coca-Cola.
- No Coke.
- Why?
Not with my card.
- But it's for me.
- Don't bust my balls!
Stop sponging.
Sponge your own people.
Or your friends out there.
It pisses me off that you're here.
He's not one of us.
Let him clean if you want. But he's
finished, so out he goes. Arab shit!
Have you finished? Out.
Fuck them!
Fuck you.
Arab shit!
How much you got left?
2 more...
3 years.
What about you?
"Rabia": Rage.
"Rabid": furious.
"Raccia"...
To caw.
Who cares?
"Radica": Root.
Electricity is like water
in a circuit.
Whatever the tube diameter
the flow is the same. Same here.
The current remains constant
1, 2 and 3.
You have to change "he" for "us".
Understand? "He ate before."
"We ate earlier".
the "we" is fine, but "to eat"...
What is the participle?
We had eaten.
Okay. Now in the indefinite past.
-We... ate.
- Do people talk this way?
It's complicated. I don't,
but they use it.
One day I saw an ad.
For a security guard.
I had no dog. I bought
a second-hand one.
In my ignorance I bought a Rottweiler.
You know how they are?
His name was Tyson.
He came with a name: Tyson.
He was huge!
His poops were bigger than mine.
I went to work at a supermarket.
I left the dog inside and
went to smoke a cigarette.
When I tried to enter again,
it was impossible.
- He didn't recognize me.
-Your own dog?
He was mad. Tyson was a psychotic.
I went in and he pounced.
I panicked and pulled out the gun.
He grabbed me like that.
I sprayed him with gas. No effect.
I ran away scared. What to do?
I left him inside.
3 hours later the employees arrived.
I didn't know they used the back door.
The dog had a field day.
He mauled them all.
He was like Karim in Block B.
- What are you doing here?
- Returning books.
Out. You come with me.
- Why are you with him?
- He's a brother. - He's a Corsican!
Dirty bastard!
- Pig!
-You call me pig?
Who is the pig?
Me a pig?
Me a pig?
Let me go!
This is not right!
This isn't Corsica.
You are being disrespectful.
El Djebena!
Tell your boss I have to
introduce a new one.
- You bring the papers?
- They haven't arrived. I bring clothes.
- Make coffee.
- For everyone?
Did you see Ilbanez?
He'll come later with the new prisoner.
Luciani.
Vettori.
- Antarro.
- Santi.
- Ceccaldi.
- Profundi.
Mosconi.
Pilicci.
-Valpato.
- Corleoni.
El Djebena.
The Minister said that Corsicans will
serve their sentences closer to home.
The law will be published on Sunday.
This is due to the revaluation of
political prisoners sponsored by Sarkozy
Currently there are no comments
from the Corsican National Front.
Cesar!
Are you there?
Did you hear the news?
When are we leaving?
- When the bill is passed.
- Soon?
No idea.
Luciani. For Mr. Sampiero.
I can tell you who won't benefit.
Not you, you know that.
Neither Pilicci, Antarr nor Prof.
You fucked up bad.
"Fuck up" wasn't used back then.
Santi and Vettori are expecting
conditional freedom, so...
- Are you saying I'm going to die alone
here? - Don't talk like that.
You're not alone.
You have strength outside.
And here?
Here!
Guard! I already pinned 3.
This is disrespectful. Seriously.
Do you work for the Imam Moussab?
He helps to rehabilitate sick prisoners.
He got me a job.
I'm doing some work for him.
Some day I'll have a real job.
- Are you sick?
- That's why I got a pardon.
Are you leaving this place?
- Do you have AIDS? - Of course not!
Don't say that. Are you crazy?
- What have you got?
- Cancer of the testicles.
- Cancer in the balls?
- Don't shout. Don't advertise it!
- Besides, I'm cured.
- Are you better then?
Thank God.
Does it hurt?
No.
Chemotherapy is what hurts.
You lose your hair.
You feel like you're 80.
You're always tired.
But thank God it's over.
I can even have kids.
- Here, for your balls, bro.
- It's welcome.
- What's your sign?
- Cancer.
Just kidding. I'm Aries.
See you, Cesar!
Take care, friend!
We won't forget you, Cesar!
Be strong, Volfoni!
See you in Bastia!
Got your phone?
Why don't you leave it with someone?
I speak Corsican.
I speak your language.
Did you understand me when
I was on the phone?
You were talking to a layer.
A what?
A lawyer?
- Who taught you?
- You... and the others.
- Looking, listening.
-You mean spying?
I didn't spy on you.
I've learned by listening.
You were here. If you weren't spying,
what were you doing? Having fun?
If I had been having fun,
I wouldn't have told you.
Why are you telling me, then?
Because the others have gone?
Look at me, Arab. Because
the others are gone, right?
Yes
Does anyone else know?
It has a life of its own.
Come sit.
Get your ass here.
Keep it.
Keep it, but don't use it.
Not everyone is like Ilbanez.
If they find it, you're fucked.
Go on with the cleaning,
washing clothes...
Ilbanez will transfer you to the
adjacent cell.
I'll have them make you a porter.
You'll get paid, you can buy stuff
and go anywhere.
You'll be my eyes and ears.
- What about the others?
- Who, my friends?
Watch them as well.
Are you happy?
You look worried.
- I'm fine.
-Well, say so.
eyes and ears
- What did Cesar say?
- The lawyer will help your brother.
He doesn't give a shit about my brother.
My wife left him 10 messages.
He never answered.
As with Santi and Castelli.
No news. Nothing.
Play.
Did you masturbate?
Jordi, the Gypsy
I like porn movies in castles.
The girls are prettier, cleaner.
How many times did you come?
- When?
- Fuck off. Who cares? Give me that.
Remember with the driver?
With his dick pointing to her pussy.
He fucks her from behind
and stuffs her ass.
And she sucks off the blonde's husband!
Then she goes for a walk with her dog.
I'll give you the rest tomorrow.
Do you make a lot dealing?
No. Enough for shopping and my drugs.
To purchase...
Want to work with me?
I don't understand your game.
- It's not a game.
-You work for the Corsicans.
I work for me.
You don't know anybody in Block C.
You don't sell to just anyone.
What will you do after you get out?
- When you leave, what will you do?
- Don't know. Do you?
- Same as here, but big.
- Hash?
Yes, hash.
But in large quantities.
Marbella-Paris, 3 cars.
600 kilos per trip.
You don't believe me?
I was just trying to imagine 600 kilos.
Something like this.
You see nothing be yond.
Got it.
They died for no reason!
You killed them!
Do you still need me?
- Do you know my business?
-You told me to stay out. - Come on...
I don't know. Things with the Italians.
Casinos in the south.
What's wrong?
- How long will you be in here?
- 3 years. Minus time for good behavior
You did half, right?
- You can get furloughs. Did you request
them? - No, that's for my lawyer.
- Has he requested them?
- Why do you ask?
Ask for parole. I'll get you
priority treatment.
Meanwhile, you can get furloughs.
You go out for me, come back, I'll pay.
What do you say?
- What's the risk?
- No risk. The risk is in here.
As soon as the judge considers the
case, he'll ask for more information,
and answer in 5 or 6 months.
I mean an answer,
not necessarily positive.
Do you have a card with your number?
I'll telephone a lawyer,
the name's Sampiero.
Give him what he asks.
Do as he says.
Present the case as soon as he
prepares it. He'll pay you.
- What about the trial?
- Don't worry. He'll explain.
Who is he? Who are these guys?
Thugs?
You never told me about it. Do you know
I can get kicked out of here?
- It's not what I need.
- It's too late. You're in this.
From now on you're a model prisoner.
You're a porter.
Be the best one.
Study for your exams.
Antarro will keep the phone.
- He'll suspect something.
- I'll tell him you pissed me off.
Peace be with you.
I was glad to receive your letter.
In the first place to hear from you.
And also to see your progress.
You write like a professional and I'm
glad. At least I served some purpose.
Now I can tell you
it was not easy.
About your request,
I'll see what I can do.
I'll send a request to visit you.
Life here isn't easy.
I will avoid saying that it's better
over there, but honestly it's tough.
Djamila has a part-time job
and it's hell with the kid.
Imam Moussab's Center got
me a job as an operator.
I get paid shit,
but I keep quiet and hang on.
Keep your head up!
Your brother, Riyad.
For the girls, Martine,
and for the boys, Jean-Pierre.
- A question.
- What's your name? - Ryad Mnaili.
You are Jean-Pierre. You already made
a mistake. Only 2 are allowed.
Be careful, put your hand
under his head.
Issam... this is Mali.
He's your godfather.
It's a garage. The owner
agrees to hire you.
He'll meet you in your day off.
It's the guy who fixes the Imam's cars.
He's already hired other guys.
Do you know what you do for them?
Does it bother you?
I go out and they pay me. If it's risky
for you, just tell me.
Risky? Are you crazy?
I'm rehabilitated. Aren't we rehabilitated?
Outside of Paris there are radars.
Go slowly.
Suddenly... the car breaks down.
Near a gas station.
The guys get off and push.
Guess who shows up to help them?
Come on, guess.
- Who?
- Guess!
- I have no idea.
- The Customs guy, the Customs!
100 kilos.
They confiscated 100 kilos.
- What is the point then?
-You'll know. You know what I want.
This is a business.
Don't you smoke my hash every day?
Are they going to screw me for
your booty? For some smokes?
- Fuck you!
- Back to your cell.
- My dessert, sir!
- Get inside!
What does the accusation say?
In view of the case, I have no objection
to grant furloughs to Mr. El Djebena.
But he can't be out more than 12 hours,
and he has to go to the police station.
Thank you. Do you have anything to add?
Let the prisoner in.
Hello, Mr. El Djebena.
I authorize a furlough. You'll leave
at 7 am and must return by 7 pm.
That's disgusting.
Do something.
The door.
- Have a good day.
- Good day, sir.
Roll up the window.
Your phone. That's my number.
So you can find me.
Want to meet Djamila?
She's alone.
Do you have a TV in your cell?
- For a day?
- Until 7.
- How is Cesar?
- He was fine yesterday.
You'll leave this someplace for us.
- What then?
- You return.
- Cesar says you don't ask questions.
- Cesar says you'll pay me.
Later, all right?
- What do we do?
-Wait until he returns.
What if something goes wrong?
Who cares?
In the middle of nowhere.
There, to the right. Here, here,
to the right. Get closer.
There's a car in front.
The messenger's an Arab!
Do I let him in?
What the fuck?
- Who are you?
- Mali El Djebena.
- Who sent you?
- Luciani.
Luciani is in jail!
Who are you?
I'm doing time with him.
-Are you in jail or out?
- One day leave.
- Do you work for those bums?
- Don't work for anyone. I work for me.
- Everything in there?
-Yes
- Can I go now?
- Have you forgotten something?
You don't know about the exchange?
Let's go.
Shut up.
Call Cesar...
You have to call Cesar.
Hello. It's me.
I have a problem.
I'm not alone.
I'm with manti.
- Calle de Madrid. They're waiting.
-We gotta go. Can you go back alone?
- Any message for Cesar? - I'll
call him. Be sure to arrive on time.
Maybe we'll work together again.
- What?
- You know...
God!
- How much?
- 25 kilos.
Take this too.
5,000.
5,000... and 25 kilos of hash?
All in a day?
We have guys to keep it and sell.
We'll supply them.
We use convoys and buy from
the source. The Gypsy has contacts.
We need 3 large cars.
Paris-Marbella in one night.
The first car to explore.
The second carries the load.
The third car as an escort.
They stay in contact by phone all night.
Each car has an exit.
-Wait, I've never done this before.
- So what's the problem?
None.
You focus on the city, I do the prison.
I'll make deals with leaving prisoners.
Jordi knows a trucker
who delivers to jails.
We invest half the money. We divide
the rest by 3. You, me and the Gypsy.
Okay.
Put a part in my account.
The rest we'll see.
- What time is it?
- 6. 45.
Let me tell you something.
Come out whenever you want!
- Be careful.
- You too.
El Djebena Mali.
35-114T.
- How was the test?
- Car repairs.
- Do you like mechanics?
- Yes, definitely.
I'm in rehab.
Bend over.
Cough.
- Sampiero said we could do it again.
- What do you think?
- It's legal.
-You see?
- Who did you see after Sampiero?
- The friend who got me the garage.
Any problems?
I'll make myself clear. Your
furloughs are mine. Period.
- Here I am still your "Arab"?
-Yes, you do the dirty work.
Put your names on the
top right and fold it.
You have one hour for French.
Then we continue with Economics.
- Do we write here?
-Yes, directly on the test sheet.
ECONOMICS
You!
I've heard about your mother.
