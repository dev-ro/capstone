Exactly three years ago,
I promised you a president
who feels your pain
and who shares your dreams.
I want to talk to you
about a fundamental threat
to American democracy.
For the first time
in the history of our country,
a majority of our people believe
that the next five years
will be worse than
the past five years.
Alpha, Alpha 15 uh,
tell us your route course.
Yeah, Alpha, Alpha 15
at November for time at Delta Delta.
Shit.
Howdy, folks.
I apologize for the delay.
We're at number 11 for take off.
We'll try to make it up
in the air.
Just wake me up over Texas.
Apologies from the flight deck.
Just a little bit of turbulence.
Thank you all for flying
TWA tonight.
Welcome to Baton Rouge.
The people's choice.

Barry.
What's that?
Barry Seal.
That's right.
You have a...
drop off and pick up service
here every other Thursday.
Cuban exiles.
They pay commercial pilots
to smuggle homegrown contraband
through Canadian hubs.
Vancouver, Montreal.
Right?
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.
- No?
- No.
You're smuggling cigars.
You have an
interesting file, Barry.
File?
Starts off with a bang.
Top of your class
in the Civil Air Patrol.
Youngest pilot in TWA history.
You were going places.
What is goin' on here?
Revolution is in the air, Barry.
Central America, right now.
We're building nations
down there, Barry.
We're building nations.
It's America at its fuckin' finest.
And we could use someone like you.
God damn.
You're CIA.
Shhh.
Holy shit.
Hot damn.
Look at her.
Well, they uh,
they tell me she's pretty fast.
Yeah. Yeah.
The fastest
twin engine on the planet.
I mean, shit.
She looks like she's goin' 300
miles an hour just sittin' there.
CIA owns this?
No. No.
Uh, Independent Aviation Consultants.
- IAC.
- Yeah.
What is that? What do they call
one of them front groups, is it?
No, no, no.
It's as real as IBM.
Uh-huh.
You'd run the company, but
after hours, you work for us.
Yup.
It takes pictures?
Mm-hmm.
We say it collects intelligence.
Uh-huh.
Where?
Russia?
Uh, south of the border.
North of the equator.
Let's just say uh...
Enemies of democracy.
Look, the real work is covert.
You understand?
- So, so uh...
- "Covert".
Anyone finds out about it, uh...
Family, friends, even uh, Lucy.
It's Lucy, right?
Yeah, that's right.
That'd be a problem.
- What?
- All this is legal?
If you're doin' it for the good guys...
yeah.
Just don't get caught.
You wanna take it for a spin?
Fuck it.
Take it for a fucking spin.
I want you to
take her for a spin.
It's all for me.
It's a new business.
It's gonna be my business.
- Okay, logistical support for airports.
- That's right.
Okay.
And you're callin' it IAC?
What do you know about business?
You are a TWA airline pilot.
That's how you support this family.
This is gonna be good for us.
What about benefits?
Our healthcare?
And we have great
healthcare with TWA.
Um, you know, I'm sure that's
not gonna be a problem.
And what the hell does
IAC mean, anyway?
Independent Aviation Consultants.
Well, that sounds fuckin'
made up, Barry.
It does?

Where are you-
where are you going?

Barry, where are you going?
Shit. I know, I know.
That was bold.
That was bold.
I do tend to leap
before I look.
Maybe uh...
Maybe I should've asked
a few more questions.
Anyways, back in '78, in uh...
September?
October.
Anyway, it uh...
That was the day
I joined the CIA.
The Allman Brothers -
"One Way Out"
Now, in those days,
the cold war was in full swing.
The Soviets were backing

all over Central America.
The CIA wanted snaps
of them insurgents.

Jay Ramsey -
"Call Me Free"
So uh, so then
I show him this one.
And he goes uh, "Goddammit, Schafer,
I didn't ask for mug shots."
I mean, they said they're
the best reconnaissance photos
they have ever seen.
So, does this mean
I get a raise?
You're doing great.
You got a family, Schafer?
Big push!
Ah, motherfucker!
Wife, kids?
See, I uh, I didn't tell Lucy
I ain't workin' for TWA no more.
You're serving your country.
I am gonna need
some more money at some point.
You'll figure it out.
Oh, uh...
We uh, we're sending you
to Panama tomorrow.
The CIA was so happy
with my work,
they gave me another job.
Bag man.
See, there was this
Colonel down in Panama
named Noriega.
And he was selling the Agency's intel
on all the commies down there.
For your friends.
My job was just to
drop off and pick up.
Just drop off.

Ma'am, what's in the bag?
We decided to try new ideas.
We want you
to take off from here.
Fly directly to Miami.
We'll pay you $2,000 per kilo.
How much is a kilo?
2.2 pounds, Mr. Seal.
$2,000...
every 2.2 pounds.
I'm sorry, fellas.
I didn't catch ya'll's names.
Jorge Ochoa.
Carlos Lehder.
Pablo Escobar.
A couple of billion
dollars from now,
they'd be known as
the Medellin Cartel.
See, back then, they're just
three businessmen
tryin' to figure out
how to get their
merchandise to the United States.
There was just
one small problem.
See, pilots, they were
killin' themselves tryin'
to get off that runway.
I see you had a few other boys
try to make it outta here.
Si. Si, terrible pilots.
Yeah, well...
I'm sure they were heavy.
You know, carryin' a lot of fuel
to make to States...
And merchandise and...
Yeah, you know, this airport,
I mean it's...
High altitude
and a short runway.
I mean, shit, you got trees
and mountains on both sides.
Is there uh,
Is there somewhere else
I could take off from?
Not where the army wouldn't notice.
Well, uh...
Can you make the runway longer?
They say
I should get rid of you.
That you can't do it.
- We have our people in Miami.
- Yeah.
You gonna land at the Okeechobee
Airport between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.
Look, there's uh...
There's been a change of plans
'cause I ain't landin' in Miami...
Oh, thank you. Gracias.
See, I ain't landin'
anywhere with this stuff.
That's, that's how
ya'll got in trouble.
Now, look, just,
just hear me out.
I know Louisiana.
Now, here's a map.
Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff
right where "X" marks the spot.
All right? Just...
What do you mean
you're not gonna land, huevon?
Okay, just...
Hey, come here, just...
Look, just look at this.
Look.
See, right here.
See that there?
Hmm.
Right there is your
million-dollar door.
All right?
You just go around.
Each side...tight.
No, no, no.
No more.
I said no more.
No mas. No mas.
No mas. No mas.
But there's plenty of room, gringo.
- No, no. Si, si, Hasta arriba.
- Guys, guys.
It ain't about room, all right?
It's about weight.
Now, we agreed on 200,
I even put on 300.
No mas.
No mas.
Keep pushin', come on.
I need all the runway I can get.
Keep goin', keep goin'.
See that.
Pare. Pare. Pare.
Hold. Hold.
Bien, bien.
Gracias, gracias.
Ho, whoa.
Where the hell do you
think you're going, big fella?
Come on. Out.
He's gonna
guard the product.
This guy's fatter than fuck.
I'm already 1500 pounds
overweight.
Either I fly the big fella,
or I fly your product.
Good luck, hermano.
God will keep you safe.
He ain't gonna make this
runway any longer.
Hey, Jorge.
Come here, give me it.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Oh!
Jesus!
Woo!
Mwah!
I've got a possible target
headed due north.
25 miles off shore.

- You missing a tooth?

What the fuck?
- See these guys here?
- Yeah.
I think they know
that I am CIA.
You're not CIA.
You're a drug smuggler, Barry.
Listen, Louisiana PD was
notified of your arrest here.
They're gonna raid your
house at 6:00 am.
They're gonna pick up Lucy,
bring her in for questioning.
Maybe even keep her overnight.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. You gotta
get me out of here.
Well, maybe...
Maybe we could figure
something out.
Okay. You can-you can
stop now, if you want, 'cause...
Believe me...
Shit gets crazy from here.
Remember them fellas that I
told you I was takin' snaps of?
Turns out, they was
a bunch of commies.
Called themselves Sandinistas.
These fellas managed to get their
shit together
and take control right here in this
little country called Nicaragua.
Oh, no, that's El Salvador.
Here you go, Nicaragua.
This is the first successful
revolution in Central America.
Now, that may have been
bad news for some people.
But not for me. See,
there's a new sheriff in town.
My fellow Americans,
I must speak to you tonight
about a mounting danger
in Central America.
Even after everything that happened,
I-I still love Ronnie Reagan.
I mean, any man that can make it
from that monkey movie
- all the way to the White House...
- What's the matter with him?
He's gotta know
what the hell he's doing.
What he wanted
was to kick them commie
Sandinistas out of Nicaragua.
And he wanted the Nicaraguan
freedom fighters
called Contras to do it.
They need to know that the U.S.
supports them
with more than just
pretty words and good wishes.
But Congress, well they smelled
the makings of another Vietnam.
And they outright refused
to let Ronnie have his war.
But do you think them politicians
could tell the Gipper what to do?
Hell, no.
He turned to the CIA.
And the CIA turned to me.
Schafer, Schafer, that uh,
morning raid on my family...
So, that's off now, right?
No, no. That's uh,
that's still happening.
- What?
- 6:00 am
This fucking country!
- Now, hold on.
- Stop!
Now, we have a deal.
I'm not a cop, Barry.
I can't make a search warrant
go away, you know?
Things are in motion here.
Come on, man.
What that hell am I gonna do?
I suggest you get your
family out of Louisiana.
- Where am I supposed to take 'em?
- We got a place for you.
Mena.
Arkansas.
Arkansas?
Hey.
Hey, Luce.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
My God, baby,
what happened to you?
I'm okay.
Barry, you're missing a tooth.
Hey, uh...
We're movin'.
We gotta pack everything up.
We gotta be outta here
before the sun comes up.
We uh, so we get these
dresses and...
You uh, do you need
all them shoes?
Hey, there, sunshine.
How you doin'? Now look,
I'm gonna give you a plastic bag.
I want you to go upstairs
and put your favorite toys...
Go on back to bed, honey.
Daddy done lost his mind.
No, darlin', you listen to Daddy.
You go do that.
- See, we're going on an adventure.
- No, we're not going on an adventure.
Like the time we went
camping in the park?
Not actually, but-'cause every
adventure's different.
Oh, my God, you're actually
serious right now.
Barry, it's 4:00 a.m.,
I'm not moving.
- Christina's school play is tomorrow!
- Do you trust me?
No!
But you love me.
You do love me.
Of course, I fucking love you.
Then listen, we gotta move.
We gotta get outta here
before the sun comes up.

Hola!
Howdy, amigos.
I'm here on behalf
of Uncle Sam.
Look, Schafer.
I ain't no military expert,
but are you sure
these are the right guys?
'Cause they seem a damn sight
more interested in my boots
than in your guns.
Look, this is getting big time.
Schafer, I just don't think
I'm the guy for this.
You just keep delivering
that pizza, you hear me?
You just keep delivering.
Hola. All right.
These are gifts.
All right?
All right? Gifts.
Regalos de mi.
Back off. Off.
Regalos.
Amigos.
Atras, atras.
Now, these guns
are gifts from Uncle Sam.
I'm not fuckin' around.
Barry! Put the bat down, huevon!
We're all friends here.
Jorge.
What the hell are you doing here?
This is Don Adolfo Calero.
He works for your
government on the revolution
to bring down the Sandinistas.
Jorge tells me you are
the crazy gringo
who always delivers.
We have a new business
proposition to you, Barry.
You bring your American
guns to Colombia,
deliver our cocaine here
to the Contras,
the Contras take it by
fishing boats to Miami,
and everybody's happy.
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.
Lucho Castellanos y su Grupo -
"Bombo y Maracas"
Turns out the Contras didn't really
want to fight a war.
They just want to make money.
Like the rest of us.
Meanwhile, the Medellin Cartel
wanted guns.
So they worked out
a little trade.
What was I gonna tell 'em?
I'm just a gringo
who always delivers.
Here's how the operation worked.
I'd load up the guns at Mena.
Then, using Schafer's intel,
I'd bypass any law enforcement
and fly straight to the
Cartel's airstrip in Medellin.
Colombians, well,
they love them guns.
Then I'd load up with fresh powder
and fly on to the
Contra training camp.
The Contras hid the coke in
fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.
Meanwhile, I'd get
another load of powder,
take it back to the States
with a quick stop to refuel in Panama,
under the protection of
my old friend, Colonel Noriega.
Congratulations on your
promotion, General.
Of course, he'd get his cut too.
On the way back,
I'd keep an eye out for the DEA.
Then I'd dump it all
in the swamps in Louisiana.
The operation got so big,
I had to get some help.
Pete Dubois, manufactured guns
until he discovered
he had a knack for selling pot.
Stan Mason flew dope from
Mexico to Arizona.
Bill Cooper,
he flew opium all around
Southeast Asia during Vietnam.
Then there's Bob.
Uh, I don't know much about Bob.
Hell of a pilot, though.
I call these boys my Snowbirds.
And we could fly through anything.
Schafer.
Barry.
How's it going?
Hey Boss!
That was fucking crazy, man!
How's it uh,
how's it going down there?
Oh, you know...
Busy.
You?
Oh, yeah.
Busy.
Where are they going?
We need to borrow some
of your land.
They want you to
fly 'em up here to-to train.
For training.
Who?
The Contras.
You want me to
bring 'em up here?
To me?
We're setting up a
field and operational training ground.
Where? On...
- My land?
- Yeah.
Starting immediately.
Which is great.
Is that a problem?
Uh... hey.
Whatever you need, boss.
Que?
Necesito un baño.
Uh... no baño.
Hang on! We're supposed to have 15.
I'm only counting 12 here.
Them Contras were damn excited
about being in the US of A.
They were runnin' away almost
faster than we could bring 'em in.
Hey, you two! Where do you
think you're going?
What, you want to quadruple
the shipments?
We're counting on the Contras
to win by summer if we...
if we give 'em what they need.
That's great.
How much more can you get
out of your guy in Mena?
We'll get everything out of him.
That's what I like to hear.
We're expanding operations, Barry.
Come on. One at a time.
One at a time! Hey, hold on.
No, no, no.
We'll take care of everybody,
just calma.
Back!
Back!
Calma, calma.
Everyone just calm the fuck down!
Salud.
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah.
Do you think those
Contras can win?
No.
Hi.
This just came.
"Go Razorbacks, Barry."
Season tickets.
50-yard line.
Well, that was awful nice of him.
How much property has Seal
bought us since he came to town?
I don't know, 500 acres?
2,000 acres.
From the airport to Ouachita.
What's he want with all that
worthless land?
It's really none of our business.
Really.
He's good people, Judy.
And he's doing a lot
for the community.
I'd like to open a bank account.
Oh, bless you!
I'll be right back.
David!
Come on, Christina!
Good job, guys.
Woo!
- Great, Christina!
- Go, go, go, go!

Hey guys, I got pizza!
You guys want some pizza?
Yeah! All right.

There you go.

I do.

All the bells and whistles.
First one in the State of Arkansas,
and she's yours.
She's mine?
She's yours.
Oh, my God, Barry!
Thank you!
- Wow.
- A little somethin' extra in there.
Fuck me, Barry!
What?
Okay, you need to behave.
Louis Clark -
Hooked on Classics (Parts 1 & 2)
I brought some snacks up
for you, Christina.
By the summer of '82,
business was booming.
Got us at Tuesday at 3:00.
Tuesday at 3:00.
We need to increase
the shipments.
Can you add a Friday delivery?
Friday? Okay. Hold on, now.
Yeah?
We want to double the
amount of guns we're bringing in.
- Double?
- Next pass by Friday.
Oh, hold on, does that-
does that have to be Friday?
I opened a few
front corporations.
I can't wait to learn
everything there is to know
about the sign business, Mr. Seal.
Me too.
I spent 30 years workin' the pumps
at Gas 'n Sip.
Well, Sir, I think it's about time
you moved to upper management.
But the money was comin' in
faster than I could launder it.
I was takin' pictures.
Delivering guns.
Droppin' off and pickin' up.
Damn, I was buildin' an air force.
New toy, boys.

What are you doing Barry!
Smile, Barry.
Jorge!
Hermano.
Lobsters!
Aw, you remember.
What, do you think I'd forget?
Your husband is a genius.
When it absolutely, positively
has to be delivered overnight...
My wife, Lucy.
No, no, no.
I had my fingers in every pie
on the rack.
$10 million in
Mena National.
$12 million in
Mena State.
15 at Mena Trust.
I had 40 parked in Miami.
20 in Panama,
$7 million in lawn bags.
8 in Samsonites, 4 buried in
the woods behind my house.
90 pounds of gold in my closet.
Hot damn!
Honey, watch the yoke.
If this ain't the greatest
country in the world.
Uh...
JB.
Uh...
Yeah.
- Hey, Sis!
- JB!
What the fuck!
Look at you!
- Look at you!
- God damn!
Get in here.
Look at this fuckin' house.
Parkin' Chevys a lot harder
than it fuckin' looks, dude.
Hey, watch your mouth
around the kids.
Sorry.
Is that right?
Yeah, man.
They had me uh...
crammin' those S-10s into every
goddamn inch of the parkin' lot.
Hey, you heard me.
I'm sorry!
But the thing is,
is that, the cars were
so close to each other, right?
- you couldn't help but scratch, right?
- Hmm.
And then, they would take
the scratches out of
my fucking paycheck, man.
- Hey! JB.
- Sorry.
Well, I don't know how
you handled the pressure, JB.
You stayin' here,
you gettin' a job.
Or you know, I could just
give you some folded cash,
you go and do what you want.
- Don't you look at him like that.
- What?
You are gettin' a job, JB,
not a handout.
My brother's gettin' a job, Barry.
You're gettin' a job.
Definitely.
You hear that? Thats the law.
You gonna have to work, son.
- You gonna have to work.
- That's right.
Hey, what-what is it
I'll be doin' exactly?
The Troyes -
"I Don't Need You"
Yo, Barry!
Barry!
Barry!
What now, JB?
Say, this is a big hangar.
And I'm tired of sweeping.
You can take a break
when you get it done.
Let's go. Get it done.
Hey man,
I got a new job for ya.
Give me a beer, man.
Dead soldier.
Eh, fuck this.
Barry?
Yeah?
Roscoe dug this up
in the backyard.
There are bills
blowin' around everywhere.
I'll rake it up in the mornin'.
I found three more of 'em
up in the fireplace.

We were runnin' out of
places to put it.
Easy. Whoa.

JB got a new car.
Did you give that boy a raise?
Hey, Barry, Luce.
What in the holy fuck?
That girl is 15.

- I told you it's huge.
- You actually live here?
- Uh-huh.
Hey. Can you talk to
you for a second?
Yeah.

- Come here
- What the hell, JB?
- What?
- I hadn't done nothin' yet.
- JB.
- JB. Come on.
- Hi, Mrs. Seal.
What-we was just
gonna go for a swim.
Come here.
- Please don't tell my mama I was here.
- Come on.
Where'd you get the
money for this car?
Ima be honest with you, Barry.
'Cause I can't lie to you.
I stole it from the hangar.
What?
I opened up
one of the Samsonites.
I found so much
fuckin' money in there.
- So much goddamn money.
- JB, JB, JB...
JB, you can't do that
You can't do that.
500 down to 300.
Watch out for that tree at the end.
Yeah, I remember that.
No, Pete, you gotta turn that off.
I can't see nothin' with that on.
Gotcha.
75. 50.
Nicely done, boss.
You boys see this?
Ho!
God!
This is the United States
Drug Enforcement Administration.
You are in violation of the
air defense identification zone.
We are ordering you
to land immediately.
Follow us to
New Orleans NAS.
All right, boys.
Gonna be a long night.
Come back to the sea, 105 knots.
And flaps down.
I repeat, we are ordering
you to land immediately.
The DEA was using these
fancy new jets
that we couldn't outrun.
Follow to New Orleans NAS.
But all that speed
comes at a heavy price.
I repeat...
They could go fast.
But we could go slow.
For a long time
Low fuel.
We gotta turn around, guys.
We're bingo.
Those pricks are
right fucking there.
All right, boys.
DEA finally ran out of gas.
Time to head home.
Bill! What the fuck, man?
Where you headed, buddy?
Come on.
All right, I'll get him.
I'll get him.
Bill! Come on, turn around.
Come on, let's go.
Bill? You hearin' me?
Oh, son of a bitch!
Bill's asleep.
God damn!
Bill, wa-wake up, man!
That motherfucker can sleep anywhere.
Wake up, Bill.
Bill!
- Good morning, Bill!
- Okay, I'm up.
Welcome back.
Those bank financials
that you asked for.
Yeah.
There's a lot of money
in Mena, Arkansas.
Thanks.
I think you're gonna appreciate
what we've done here, Barry.
Making me my own vault?
Oh, no, no. We're using this auxiliary
for all our other customers.
We gave you the main vault.
How 'bout that.
Aerostar
two one niner three Golf.
Head to New Orleans
Naval Air Station at once.
Yeah, come on, come on,
come on!
You better run, you prick.
This is the United States
Border Patrol.
Shit.
We are ordering you to land.
Hey, boys.
I see you finally got smart
and got a slower plane.
Two of 'em.
That's right, son.
We're up here as long as you want.
Aerostar, we are ordering you
to land immediately.
All right, motherfuckers.
Let's land.
I repeat, we are ordering
you to land imm...
What the fuck?
Stay on him.
Shit.
Oh, shit!
Is this your yard?
That's for the damage.
And uh...
Here's a little somethin' extra
for your sister.
Hey, little darlin'.
And your bike.
You never saw me.
A plane crashed in Louisiana with
200 kilos of Colombian powder.
200.
- Right.
- Is that your boy?
I'm sorry, are you working
for the fucking DEA now?
Interesting read.
I got it.
- Hello, amigo.
- Si.
I had to get out of Colombia
in the middle of the night.
I wasn't the only one
having trouble with the DEA.
Escobar's gone crazy and
declared war on the government.
Thanks to Pablo Escobar's
unique management style...
the cartel found themselves
kicked out of Colombia.
The only place the
DEA couldn't touch him?
That's right. Nicaragua.
- Is everything okay here?
- Yes, we're late.
We're going to meet Sr. Vaughan.
He's the Minister of Interiors.
Controls the airstrips.
It's how we get you in.
Barry, sit and shut your mouth.

- Yes.
- Honey? You all right?
- Yeah, I can hear you.
Honey, I hate to tell you this
right now, but JB's been arrested.
- That little shit.
- What happened?
I don't know. He got caught
with a lot of money.
- That dumbfuck.
- Honey...
What do you want
me to do here, babe?
There ain't

How much? Cuanto?

Can you do it?

I'll figure it out.
Get it fucking done.
Fucking lawyer
doesn't know shit.
I got two fucking priors, man.
And he doesn't understand.
No, no, no.
He does understand.
And you gotta do
what he tells you to do.
No, he doesn't, man.
One more strike, man. One more
strike and I can go to prison...
- for-for life, man.
- JB.
JB, just...
hold on.
Barry?
Barry, are you there?
Daddy!
Hey, darlin'.
What's that?
Hold on.
- Yeah?
- Barry.
We've been trying
to get a hold of you, amigo.
Yeah, I know that, amigo. Listen,
could you hold on, I'll be right back.
- JB?
- Yeah.
There's some people
that wanna talk to me.
No, no no. You don't talk to
anyone about anything.
Now, you do what that
lawyer tells you to.
And you keep your
fucking mouth shut.
- I'm taking care of this.
- Okay.
Listen, Jorge, we gotta put on
the brakes for a bit.
Brakes? No, no, no.
No brakes.
We have product to move.
I understand amigo,
but I-I got a family situation.
Eh, your brother-in-law.
We know all about it.
- We'll handle it, amigo.
- No, no, no, no.
- I don't want you to handle it.
- Barry, listen.
- I got it. I got this.
- Barry, listen to me.
We'll handle it, okay?
So don't worry.
- We'll talk business later.
- Jorge...
Barry, they don-they don't know
about them suitcases you got.
or what you got in them planes,
the guns you got.
They don't know anything about it.
We're good, man.
I can't fix this.
You hear?
They're gonna give you 10-
10 years for not talkin'.
That's 10 years people
gotta worry you will.
I didn't say anything, man.
You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.
Where we going, man?
You serious?
I'm fucking family.
We're family!
That's right. Right.
We're a family.
- What's that?
- Inside's a passport...
first-class ticket to
Bora Bora and enough cash...
Enough cash to make
a damn good life for yourself.
Now, you're gonna
get in that car,
and you're gonna drive straight
to Dallas Fort Worth Airport
and nowhere else.
You don't even
stop to take a piss.
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.
Good luck, kid.
I'll tell you what, Barry.
I'm gonna send you a
goddamn address, okay, Barry?
You're gonna start sending
me cash on the fucking regular.
You understand?
You hear me?
Oh, and Barry...
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you and my cunt sister!
Hey!
Money every week, asshole!
What the fuck?
What?
Oh, shit.
Hey, hey! Barry!
Hey, Barry!
Barry!
Yeah, Bill, what do you need?
What do you need?
Man, man, I'm like
freakin' out, man.
What is goin' on with JB?
- Huh?
- Don't worry about JB.
What if he talks, man?
- He ain't gonna.
- Yeah, but what if he does?
- He ain't gonna talk, Bill.
- How do you know?
I am fucking positive.
Okay, man.
Good, I'm gonna trust
you on this one, man.
Good.
In calendar year, your
operations have transported
10,500 Russian AKs
to the Contras.
Yeah.
5,000 of which, have found
themselves in the hands
of the Colombian Cartel.
- Right, but...
- Out of the 916 Contras
brought in to the
United States to train,
only half made it back
to Nicaragua.
- Half is...
- The other half are in the wild...
What's going on here?
Oh, yeah. We had to send
the Contras home.
- Home?
- Yeah.
They weren't fighting.
That's the reality
of that situation.
You know, it didn't help that
their guns were in Colombia.
Did it, Barry?
So...
What now?
We'll call you.
Call me?
Schafer?
Hey, Schafer.
Who the fuck's Schafer?
Okay, everybody.
You know the drill.
Everybody gets a burn bag.
Into it, you put anything
with Barry Seal's face
or name on it.
Come on, boys.
We gotta move.
We gotta get all this
stuff outta here.
- Pete. What, everything?
- Come on, boys, lets go.
We gotta move this out.
Let's go! Let's go!
Into the burn bag, go!
Purchase orders,
aircraft invoices,
Need a team here,
let's move it out.
Oh, shit, man.
Look at all these guns.
We gotta move all of it.
Where are we supposed
to put all this stuff?
Just get it off my property.
Anything with the words "Mena".
Fuel bills, memos, names,
directives, photos, anything like that,
anything that can link us with him,
you put in the burn bag...
and then what do you do with it?
- Burn it.
- You burn it.
Bob, I need a little help

Well, hey, boys.
How about my phone call?
We're sorry, you have reached

If you feel you have reached

Come on, Seal.
You know who I am, Mr. Seal?

State Attorney General.
You've got DEA, ATF, FBI

Now, you may be wondering why
my ass wasn't in jail at this point.
This is disgusting!
Now, I gotta be honest.
Frankly, so was I.
This fella here, is with the DEA.
And this fella here, is a colonel
named Ollie North.
Reagan's go-to guy.
The DEA just wants to nail the
Medellin Cartel once and for all.
Now, at the same time,
Colonel North wants to prove
that commies in Central America
are involved in the drug trade.
- Let me say that again,
- This is disgusting!
Colonel North wants to prove
that commies are dealing drugs.
And why am I in the room?
'Cause I'm the gringo

So you want me to keep going?
For your country.
We're gonna bring these guys down.
And you're gonna be a hero.
All right then.
They put me right

You have one here in a bag.
The sightline goes

You have two more cameras

Sightlines directly

Each camera has a cord.
You just press this button

That's it.
Let's go.
I can see the cords, Barry.
Yeah.
I can see this damn cord
which means they're
gonna be able to see it.
- We'll hide it.
- I'm not a photographer.
- Your thumb work?
- Yeah.
Well, you just push a button.
When am I supposed to
press the button?
When the guys are standin' here
holdin' the powder.
You know what, fuck it, Pete.
I'll take the pictures.
Fuck.
Listen, once we have
one of these photos,
who exactly is
gonna be lookin' at 'em?
These photos are gonna be
on a need-to-know basis.
Need-to-know.
They're gonna be classified
at the highest levels, Barry.
- Daddy!
- Classified.
We do recognize
the dangers involved here.
No, you don't.
Or you can always
tell us to fuck off
and spend the next
30 years in Leavenworth.
Come on, Boss!
Let's get this over with!
I'll see you, Rangel.
- Smile, Barry!
- Bye, Daddy!
Shit, there's a fuckin'

They're gonna torture us.

There seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas
will not stoop.
This is an outlaw regime.
The Sandinistas have even
involved themselves
in the international drug trade.
I know every American parent
concerned about the
drug problem will be outraged
to learn that top Nicaraguan
government officials
are deeply involved
in drug trafficking.
This picture, secretly taken
at a military airfield
outside Managua,
shows Federico Vaughan,
a top aide to one of
the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua...
Fuck!

with illegal narcotics
Motherfuckers! That's your

This is a outlaw regime.
Oh, my God.
Just as you said, Pablo.
That son of a bitch.
Pablo, we must face
it immediately.
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.
I am truly sorry, Barry.
North jumped the gun.
Well, you boys fucked me good.
We all got fucked.
Those photos weren't
supposed to be released.
And certainly not until
we had the Colombians in custody.
Yeah, well, he ain't
gonna be comin' for you.
Barry, you knew the risks
when you took those pictures.
You knew what
you were doing.
Barry?
Barry, you there?

You understand?
And that's insurance for you

All right?
I understand.
All right, don't forget that.
It's gonna be all right.
- It's gonna be all right, I love you.

Sure enough, they came.
And they took it all.

you're safe.
No.
No, I ain't goin' nowhere.

- No, sir!
- I ain't doin' this. No.

No, no. Honey, no.
Don't do this now.
Sir, sir,
I'm sorry, no, no, no.
Come on, sir.
Excuse me,

Luce, you gotta stop. Hey.
You know, fellas!
Sorry, hey...

Can I just have a moment
with my wife?
It's been a hell of a day.
- Okay, Barry.
- Yeah.
You got one minute.
All right, Luce?
Honey, honey...
- Honey, listen to me.
- Let's give him a minute.

Luce and the kids finally
did move to Baton Rouge.
How can we have a war on drugs...
when the biggest
enemy of the state
is being protected by our side?
And that lady prosecutor...
She never ever did give up.
...such sting operation was underway.
The defendant will rise.
- Barry Seal.
- Your Honor.
You are sentenced to 1,000
hours community service.
Dismissed.
- Oh, that is bullshit.
- Watch yourself, Sibota.
- I'm sorry, uh, community service?
- ...a drug smuggler of the highest order!
- Exhibit D!
- Mr. Seal's planes are classified.
- I'm sick to fuck of this Mickey Mouse...

- Sibota!
I will hold you in contempt!
So I'm walkin' outta here?
Now?
The State of Arkansas
has spoken, Mr. Seal.
- Do I have to go?
- Goodbye.
Listo pues.
All right, amigos.
And uh...
I do tend to leap
before I look.
Maybe uh...
Maybe I should've
asked a few more questions.
Excuse me,
Uh, sir, ma'am?

movin' out the way?
I'm just gonna start my car.
Yeah, I really appreciate that, now.

You know, I guess you could say

Defend a country.
And create the biggest
drug cartel this world's ever seen.
DEA. CIA. White House.

Sometimes a little more

Authorities believe last night's
machine-gun killing of Barry Seal

Pete became a rural pastor in

The CIA continued using
Barry's planes to arm the Contras.
Shit! Come on,

Until one of them was
shot down in Nicaragua.
That sparked the Iran-Contra scandal.
Mr. President, what do you know
about money going to the Contras?
All I know is this is just
gonna taste wonderful
and I'm looking forward
to tomorrow.
Vice President Bush, did you know
about the Contra aid or not, sir?
