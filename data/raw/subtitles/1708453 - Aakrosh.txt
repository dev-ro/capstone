And then..
Down with..
- C<b>B</b>l.
Down with..
- C<b>B</b>l.
Stop this corruption<b>!</b>
Down with..
- C<b>B</b>l.
Gautam, Dhiresh and Dinu..
- Get them back.
No one is ready to
take the responsibili<b>ty</b>..
..of the missing students.
As you can see..
..all the students of the
M<b>K</b> Gandhi Medical College..
..are on hunger strike.
Their demand from
the government is to..
..find the students who went
missing from <b>J</b>an<b>j</b>har district..
..and carry out an
investigation on it ..
.. and send the C<b>B</b>l for the same.
Down with..
- Delhi police.
The lndian
government is in deep slumber.
We won't put up with
this ine<b>ff</b>iciency.
The lndian
government is in deep slumber.
We won't put up with
this ine<b>ff</b>iciency.
Down with..
- <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har police.
Along with the Delhi police,
the <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har police..
..is also trying to wash
their hands o<b>ff</b> this case.
No one is ready to
take the responsibili<b>ty</b>..
..of the missing students.
Students demand..
We have with us the friend
of those three students..
..and the student president
of this place. Ramesh <b>J</b>ain.
Mr. Ramesh, can you tell us
when you last spoke to those..
..students<b>?</b> - <b>O</b>n <b>26</b>th <b>O</b>ctober,
the day they went missing.
What did you talk to them about<b>?</b>
- They were <b>j</b>ust saying..
..that the <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har
police had arrested them..
..and then call got disconnected.
So do you know why
they went to <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har<b>?</b>
Dhiresh and Gautam
went to Dinu's village..
..to celebrate
'Dussehra' <b>(</b>Hindu festival<b>)</b>.
They were supposed to
come back the ne<b>x</b>t day.
lt's been <b>tw</b>o months since then.
<b>B</b>ut till now we've got to
know nothing about them.
And the police and the
government's response..
..to the whole a<b>ff</b>air is
e<b>x</b>tremely irresponsible..
Down with.. - C<b>B</b>l.
'The irresponsible response
of the government..'
'..seem to be the
best words to describe..
.. the reason behind
the students' fury.'
'From M<b>K</b> Gandhi Medical college..'
'..it's me Shalini Dey, with
cameraman Ashutosh Mishr, delhi.'
Sir, we would like to
ask you a <b>q</b>uestion..
<b>B</b>ecause of it M<b>K</b>
Gandhi Medical College..
..you will have to answer.
Sir, we would like to know
what the government is doing.
Sir, it's been <b>tw</b>o months
since the students went missing.
Why is the government
not taking a serious step<b>?</b>
That's not true. The
government is trying its level best.
Sir, what will be
government's ne<b>x</b>t step<b>?</b>
For that we have chosen a C<b>B</b>l team..
..which has already
left for <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har.
Sir, sir, please tell.. - What is..
- No more <b>q</b>uestions please.
Hail lndia, sir.
- Hail lndia.
Please give it to me, sir.
Please come, sir.
Ma<b>j</b>or Pratap <b>K</b>umar,
o<b>ff</b>icer under.. ministry.
Siddhant Chaturvedi, C<b>B</b>l.
Come, we shall talk on the way.
Did you read this<b>?</b>
At such a beautiful
and serene place..
..murders, kidnappings and rapes..
Crimes like
booth-capturing are taking place.
And that, too, thrice the
number in Delhi and Mumbai.
Not thrice, but
five times the number.
The complaints of most of
the crimes are not registered.
lf that happens, the army
will have to leave the border..
..and come and put up a
tent here in this village.
So what you mean to say is
that whatever is written..
..in these documents is wrong<b>?</b>
These documents are the
proof of the ine<b>ff</b>iciency..
..of the government
o<b>ff</b>icials sitting in AC rooms.
People living in the ci<b>ty</b>
are far away from the truth.
Now that you are here, you
will understand eve<b>ryt</b>hing slowly.
<b>B</b>y the way, what's your age<b>?</b>
l am old enough to be in-charge
of <b>tw</b>o high-profile en<b>q</b>uiries..
..out of which si<b>x</b> saw convictions..
..and because of
that l am sent here..
..as the in-charge of
this en<b>q</b>uiry and your boss.
<b>Y</b>ou must've guessed my age.
ln the army, my
commander used to say..
..Son, confidence is
a double-edged sword.
lf you hit the target right,
you are on top.
lf not, may God help you.
That's a good one.
Sorry, sir. This is the
only lodge in <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har.
A lot of woodwork goes
on in this area, sir.
Sir, with great di<b>ff</b>icul<b>ty</b>,
we got <b>j</b>ust one room.
<b>Y</b>ou <b>tw</b>o will have to share it, sir.
Where did you set up the o<b>ff</b>ice<b>?</b>
We got an old theatre, sir.
The negotiations are going on, sir.
We will strike a
deal in a day or <b>tw</b>o.
Have you gone mad or what..
lf he learns from there,
l will believe it.
Tell me what l should write.
- <b>Y</b>ou can ask him.
Siddhanth Chaturvedi. l
need to meet Mr. <b>V</b>ibhuti.
<b>Y</b>ou..
Sir is busy in a <b>V</b>lP meeting.
Sit there and wait for a while.
- <b>O</b>kay, okay.
<b>O</b>nly these <b>tw</b>o.
Sir, <b>K</b>anua's father has brought..
.. his son's release orders..
..from Delhi government.
He says that we may
kill him in an encounter.
Who cares about
the Delhi government<b>?</b>
That scoundrel. Again
he paid Rs. <b>100</b> less.
<b>B</b>rother, if l wish l can even kill..
..his wife and kids and his
whole family in an encounter.
Who can stop me<b>?</b>
<b>Y</b>es. <b>B</b>ut, sir, this
is a prope<b>rty</b> dispute.
Panchan, you idiot. Du<b>ff</b>er.
Now will l have to teach
you how much time it takes..
..to turn a prope<b>rty</b>
case into a rape case<b>?</b>
Hello.
l'm in the o<b>ff</b>ice.
l see.
How old is the girl<b>?</b>
l see. <b>O</b>kay, the goods are original<b>?</b>
Sir, he says his goat entered Mr.
Chaubey's garden by mistake.
lt completely destroyed their..
..e<b>x</b>pensive rose garden.
These girls always
try to e<b>x</b>ploit us.
How long will it take<b>?</b>
<b>Y</b>es. Don't forget the protection.
What<b>?</b>
- How much longer will it take<b>?</b>
l told you that he is busy
with a <b>V</b>lP in the meeting.
Who's the <b>V</b>lP<b>?</b> - Do you know
all the <b>V</b>lPs of our region<b>?</b>
Go sit there and wait.
l will ring the bell and call you.
Forget this <b>V</b>lP.
l will wait for
another five minutes..
..and then break open the door.
<b>Y</b>ou don't worry. lt will be done.
Don't worry at all. - <b>O</b>kay. Goodbye.
Alright. Goodbye.
Sir. - <b>Y</b>es<b>?</b> - These guys came for
you. - Siddhant Chaturvedi, C<b>B</b>l.
<b>Y</b>es. l got a call from
Delhi that someone's coming.
Did you have tea and snacks<b>?</b> Hey,
Saithu. - l'll get it.
No, no, thank you.
We need some information
about those three boys.
<b>Y</b>es, why have these Delhi o<b>ff</b>icials
created such havoc unnecessarily<b>?</b>
Which three boys<b>?</b> We
have no idea at all.
<b>B</b>ut they call us
everyday and trouble us.
Mr. Chaturvedi, do you
have any knowledge..
..about the three of them<b>?</b>
- As per the mobile records..
..those boys made the
last call from <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har.
What are you saying<b>?</b>
- As soon as they said..
..that the <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har
police has arrested them..
..their phone got disconnected.
- Arrested<b>? B</b>y us<b>?</b>
Does anyone know if there is
some other police station..
..in this area other than ours<b>?</b>
- How's that possible, sir<b>?</b>
There isn't, right<b>?</b>
Total cross-connection.
Look, don't waste your time here.
This story seems like a
figment of someone's imagination.
Those boys must've
gone somewhere else.
And an<b>yw</b>ay, the kids
of this generation..
..are <b>q</b>uite hot-blooded.
They must've gone to Mumbai..
..or somewhere
else to have some fun.
And they sent you here
from Delhi unnecessarily.
That's the situation. Tell us if
we can do an<b>yt</b>hing else for you.
An<b>yt</b>hing else<b>?</b> - We will call
you if there's an<b>yt</b>hing else.
<b>O</b>kay, okay.
- Let's go.
<b>B</b>rother, the water is di<b>rty</b>.
lt's not good.
<b>Y</b>ou'll get pure water in that well.
We don't need water, <b>B</b>rother. <b>J</b>ust
tell us where we'll get Rukumlal.
Who are you<b>?</b> - We've come
from Delhi. We are policemen.
Where are you going, <b>B</b>rother<b>?</b>
<b>J</b>uni. <b>J</b>uni.
- We've come to help you.
We've come to help you.
Please listen to us.
Where will l find Rukumlal<b>?</b>
Father is not here. <b>Y</b>ou
will find him at work.
Hey, <b>J</b>uni. Why are you
talking to him<b>?</b> Come here.
The people here are
<b>q</b>uite afraid of the police.
<b>B</b>y the way, who is this Rukumlal<b>?</b>
- Dinu's brother-in-law.
He must know something about him.
Who is Rukumlal here<b>?</b>
- The one in the vehicle.
Hey.
Are you Dinu's brother-in-law<b>?</b>
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.
Two months ago Dinu came to the
village with his <b>tw</b>o bu<b>ff</b>alos.
Did he meet you<b>?</b>
No, sir. He didn't meet me.
He came to the
village and didn't meet..
..his only sister
and brother-in-law<b>?</b>
<b>Y</b>ou are hiding something.
Why did Dinu come here<b>?</b>
l don't know, sir.
Please forgive me.
- Don't be scared, Rukumlal.
Tell me the truth. He
must've met someone in the village.
Did he have any enmi<b>ty</b> with anyone<b>?</b>
l told you once, l don't know
an<b>yt</b>hing. Please forgive me.
Let me go. - <b>Y</b>ou are
<b>tw</b>iddling thumbs over here<b>?</b>
Come on, get back to work. Come on.
Grandpa, how much is <b>8</b>
multiplied by <b>7? 54</b> or <b>56?</b>
Son, l am an illiterate man.
<b>O</b>nly Dinu could've
answered your bookish <b>q</b>uestions.
l don't know where he..
- <b>J</b>uni, don't trouble grandpa.
<b>K</b>eep that book there
and have your meal.
Look who's there at the door.
- Coming. Coming.
Wait a minute.
There's that idiot..
Get him. Get him.
Get him<b>!</b>
Where will you run<b>?</b>
Get him.
The o<b>ff</b>icials are here. Come inside.
Hey, <b>J</b>uni, where is your father<b>?</b>
Tell me.
Last night some
guys took father away.
<b>J</b>uni, come inside.
- Listen. Listen to me.
Can you tell me who
took Rukumlal away<b>?</b>
Don't ask me any <b>q</b>uestions, sir.
l want my husband alive.
<b>Y</b>es, so did you file a
complaint in the police station<b>?</b>
Why don't you understand
that we want to help you<b>?</b>
<b>O</b>h, God. What is
wrong with everybody<b>?</b>
Why doesn't anyone
say an<b>yt</b>hing here<b>?</b>
ln the last si<b>x</b> months,
eleven people..
..were kidnapped in broad daylight.
Their dead bodies were
recovered from railway tracks..
..wells and near the highway.
And still you don't file a
complaint in the police station.
lf investigated,
the cause of death..
..is registered as
suicide or accidents. Why<b>?</b>
<b>B</b>ecause neither is there any
complaint, nor any witness.
ls everyone blind in
this neighborhood<b>?</b>
We are alive.. because we are blind.
<b>O</b>nly those have been
kidnapped from here..
..who wanted to become a witness.
<b>U</b>ncle, we are from C<b>B</b>l, from Delhi.
At least one of you say something.
We'll protect you.
Sir, we would be thankful to you
if you leave us in our condition.
Goodbye.
What's going on, SP sir<b>?</b>
Last night there was an
attack on Dinu's home.
His brother-in-law
Rukumlal has been kidnapped.
Really<b>?</b> - <b>Y</b>es. Have
you taken any action yet<b>?</b>
Rela<b>x</b>, Rela<b>x</b>.
Why are you getting so furious<b>?</b>
The police depa<b>rt</b>ment of
our country takes an action..
..when someone files a complaint.
What else do you want now<b>?</b>
That l should go to
everyone's home every day and ask..
..Sister, do you have any
complaint to file<b>?</b> No<b>?</b> Fine.
And while we are at it, shall we
also send some groceries for you<b>?</b>
And you say..
- lf that's your problem..
..then l will file the complaint.
l am warning you, SP sir.
l need Rukumlal within <b>24</b> hours.
lf l write in my repo<b>rt</b>
that the <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har police..
..is suppo<b>rt</b>ing the criminals,
then you know..
..what could be the
conse<b>q</b>uences very well.
<b>B</b>anke, file the complaint.
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.
Hey, Sarko.
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.
Go and bring a cold drink for sir.
These ci<b>ty</b> people get
heated up very soon. Right<b>?</b>
What are you doing<b>? Y</b>ou're on
the computer since a long time.
Mother has sent the photos
of some girls.. for a match.
<b>J</b>ust checking them.
Did you like anyone<b>?</b>
- l left that decision to mother.
She should like her.
She will get me
married as soon as l go back.
Forge tall this.
Tell me what you think.
Why are the
villagers so afraid to talk<b>?</b>
lt's an old fear. Now
it's a pa<b>rt</b> of their lives.
What do you mean<b>?</b> - l will
tell you an interesting story.
There's a small village
at about <b>80</b> kms from here.
Shabrampur.
A poor 'Dalit' <b>(</b>Low social
class<b>)</b> family used to live there.
<b>Y</b>ou know, 'Mother, father,
<b>tw</b>o daughters, one son' <b>ty</b>pes.
They bought a farm with
their lifelong earnings.
Got a good harvest from the farm.
Got some money from the harvest.
With that money,
they bought <b>tw</b>o cows.
Ganga and <b>J</b>amuna.
<b>O</b>ne day when the 'Thakur'
<b>(V</b>illage head<b>)</b> of the village..
..was passing by, he
commented in friendly banter..
..Hey, 'Dalit', you
have prospered a lot.
Do you want to become a
landlord like me or what<b>?</b>
And that 'Dalit'
also replied <b>j</b>okingly..
..No matter how hard we try..
..we can never become
'Thakurs' from Dalits.
<b>B</b>ut, yes, if God wishes, my
children would study well..
..and lead even better
lives than the Thakurs.
The Thakur thought of it not as
a <b>j</b>oke, but a slap in the face.
That night when
the family returned..
..from the '<b>J</b>anmashtami'
<b>(</b>Lord <b>K</b>rishna's bi<b>rt</b>hday<b>)</b> fair..
..they saw their house, farm, cows..
..eve<b>ryt</b>hing had been burned.
Ne<b>x</b>t morning, the
father brought sweets..
..for the whole family
and said..Don't worry.
<b>E</b>ve<b>ryt</b>hing will be fine.
And eve<b>ryt</b>hing did become fine.
The father had mi<b>x</b>ed poison
in the sweets. <b>E</b>veryone died.
<b>B</b>ut somehow their son survived.
Well, the point being,
you will get to hear..
..such stories everyday here.
This fear is deep-rooted in them.
Shocking.
<b>B</b>y the way, what does
that boy do nowadays<b>?</b>
Right now he's ironing his shi<b>rt</b>.
l thought since poison
didn't work for me..
..so l would try some whiskey.
The light flashes in..
..bits and pa<b>rt</b>s.
My darling<b>!</b>
lt is filled in my hea<b>rt</b>.
l became as

There was an attack

They threw a burning

And let me tell you something.
We are helpless.

Mr. <b>V</b>ibhuti, from tomorrow l need..

Couldn't he have said this before<b>?</b>
Hail lndia, sir.
- Hail lndia.
What's happening there<b>?</b>
Sir, the chief engineer has shut
the ou<b>tf</b>low of water from the dam.
That's why the farmers are enraged.
Moreover, it
hasn't rained this year.
lf the water from
the dam is stopped..
..the entire yield
here will get ruined, sir.
Sister Geeta, l had made a wish
for you at Shankar Teela yesterday.
Wear this holy thread.
<b>Y</b>ou'll surely be able to conceive.

di<b>ff</b>icult to keep yourself clean.
What's your name<b>?</b>

Sir wants to know
your name. Full name.
Siddhant Chaturvedi.
'He has been trying his best.'
Are you a <b>B</b>rahmin<b>?</b>
That's why you are so
conscious about cleanliness.
What di<b>ff</b>erence does it make with..
..regards to
cleanliness if l am a <b>B</b>rahmin<b>?</b>
<b>B</b>elieve it or not, Son. lt does.
And that, too, in the entire country.
People in the ci<b>ty</b>
wash their hands..
..if some guy from a
low caste touches them.
<b>B</b>ut l don't let the need
to wash hands arise here.
Fantastic. The white-skin is out.
What a diving catch.
Monkey s<b>ty</b>le.
Lousy guy. He's out.
Hey, call him up. Turn it around.
<b>B</b>et Rs. <b>2</b> lakhs on lndia now.
Sir, the one who bowled is a Muslim.
And the one who took the
catch belongs to a low caste.
And the ones who are
hugging both of them..
..comprise of <b>B</b>rahmins,
Sikhs and <b>K</b>shatriyas, too.
'And the new man in is..'
l wish we could learn
something from cricket.
Many bigwigs have come to teach us.
<b>B</b>ut l wonder where they disappear.
We get tired looking
for them ourselves.
That reminds me.
Wait up.
<b>Y</b>ou came here to look
for some boys, didn't you<b>?</b>
How far has your
investigation reached<b>?</b>
How far do you e<b>x</b>pect<b>?</b>
The Shool Army
attacked him last night.
<b>B</b>ut let him save his own life first.
Then he can save
someone else's life.
l understand. - 'That is
great going for the men in blue.'
l'm the leader around here.
l understand eve<b>ryt</b>hing.
The thing is that when
the press and media..
..pressuri<b>z</b>e the government..
..the government..
Stop it, will you<b>?</b>
The government, too,
has to play out a drama.
lt has to form an in<b>q</b>uiry committee.
And who gets trapped<b>?</b>
<b>Y</b>ou C<b>B</b>l o<b>ff</b>icials..
and these policemen.
Who reads the repo<b>rt?</b>
There is a hue and cry
for a couple of days.
And then when lndian wins a match,
eve<b>ryt</b>hing's forgotten.
<b>E</b>ve<b>ryt</b>hing's <b>j</b>ust get
erased from the people's mind.
They don't remember an<b>yt</b>hing, sir.
That's why l suggest,
write whatever you feel like..
..in the repo<b>rt</b>
and go back to Delhi.
'Now it's Gautam Gambhir
who's coming out to..'
Why are you getting
your hair spoilt..
..in the dust and
mud of this village<b>?</b>
Here are some nice bananas.
Rs. <b>12</b> a do<b>z</b>en.
Geeta.
Geeta.
<b>B</b>rother, the eggplants
l had bought from you..
..last time were absolutely
rotten from the inside.
Geeta, l want to talk to you.
l don't talk to strangers.
Don't do this the ne<b>x</b>t time.
Geeta.. Geeta, l'm
talking to you. Geeta.
<b>B</b>rother, how much

Ma'am, why are you asking the price<b>?</b>
<b>Y</b>ou should've
informed me. l would've..

Don't add to my woes.
Please leave me alone.
Help. Help. Help him. Come on.
Hey. Move. <b>B</b>ack o<b>ff</b>.
He is alive. He is alive.
This is a dead body.
lt's a police matter.
Come on.
Take him to the
hospital before the media..
..shows up with their entourage.
God forbid, if he dies,
we'll have to face the media.
Come on. Hurry up.
Which hospital are
you taking him to<b>?</b>
Whatever happens in
our area is our headache.
<b>J</b>ust stick to the
task you're here for.
l had lodged the FlR about him.
So we've found him.
Now do you want to
suck the life out of us<b>?</b>
Come on. Go. Go.
Let's go, Siddhant. Let him go.
Rukumlal is the only
link to this case.
lt's pe<b>rt</b>inent that we find
about his kidnappers before he dies.
He is only half-dead now.
lf we chase, he'll die for sure.
<b>B</b>y now you must've
reali<b>z</b>ed that we can't..
..carry out the
investigation in public like this.
What do you think<b>?</b>
Am l doing an
investigation for the first time<b>?</b>
Two high profile in<b>q</b>uiries.
Si<b>x</b> convictions.
l remember eve<b>ryt</b>hing.
<b>B</b>ut the law here is di<b>ff</b>erent
from that of the other countries.
Here every hea<b>rt</b> is under terror.
No one will open their
mouth even by mistake.
We'll have to return emp<b>ty</b>-handed.
Hello. We'll not have
to go back emp<b>ty</b>-handed.
The car of those three
boys has been found.
Do you believe in God<b>?</b>
- No.
God comes to our aide
in various disguises.
This time he came in the
disguise of the chief engineer.
The one who shut the
water of this dam.
The moment the water
level receded.. <b>V</b>iola.
lt e<b>x</b>posed the roof of the car.
Then the name of this
God is co-incidence.
Found an<b>yt</b>hing<b>?</b>
Sir, not much. Some
bottles of soft drinks.
An earring and a mobile phone.
l guess there was a girl
with those boys that night.
<b>B</b>ut, sir, we haven't got a

<b>B</b>ack o<b>ff</b>.
<b>O</b>ne thing's clear, Pratap.
This car did not fall.
lt was made to fall.
This is not an accident.
There is not even a scratch on
the headlights and the grills.
And nor on the railing.
Pass me the lens.
Get a specimen of this. Please.
l think this car was dropped
into the water with a crane.
This mark on such a high railing..
..could be only because
of the arms of the crane.
Find out who has a red
colored crane in <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har district.
<b>Y</b>es, sir.
- And, yes.
Send for a rescue
team of lady divers.
Comb the entire area.
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.
Hey. Found an<b>yt</b>hing<b>?</b>

Two loincloths. And a left sandal.

Hey. Listen. Hey.
Last year my sister-in-law

Sister-in-law was an absolute witch.
Say goodbye to her from a distance.
Anyone who finds her mug,

Do return it.
What's happening here<b>?</b>
The C<b>B</b>l guys are selling fish.
Fresh Rohu. Five for Rs. <b>10</b>.

Sir, we've found four
red cranes from this area.
All four are registered in

And the paint specimen we took
from the railing of the bridge..

of the cranes, sir.
And its repo<b>rt</b> is in this file.
<b>B</b>y the way, sir, Sughna Gilgit is
famous among the locals as Nasbandi.
Nasbandi<b>?</b>
<b>Y</b>es, sir.
That's because he
stabs all his victims..
..in their private
pa<b>rt</b>s and kills them.
l've got Rakesh on the <b>j</b>ob, sir.
We'll get the rest of the
information very soon as well.
Come on, drink from your cup.

Listen. Come on.
The brakes of his
car weren't working.
Some lunatic <b>j</b>umped before
his car. Got ran over and died.
What could he do if that
poor guy ran out of luck<b>?</b>
lf he had stayed there, the people..
..would've beaten
him to death as well.
That's why he directly
came under my refuge.
<b>B</b>rother, button the topmost button.
He is lying.
<b>Y</b>es. <b>Y</b>ou are absolutely right.
At first, l also took him to be
a fraud and did not believe him.
That's why l sent the car
directly to the workshop.
Here's the repo<b>rt</b>.
The brakes of his car
were indeed not working.
Were completely failed.
Hey. Move.
- Hand him over to us.
How can we, <b>B</b>rother<b>?</b>
We want to investigate in our way.
Sir, we'll have to
complete ce<b>rt</b>ain formalities.
We'll take him to
the hospital first.
He'll be e<b>x</b>amined to
see if he's drunk.
Then he'll be
presented in the cou<b>rt</b>.
And l can hand him over to
you only after all this.
As you can see, l've

So please don't disturb me anymore.
Please leave. Leave. Leave.

After that, did he go out somewhere<b>?</b>
No. He was watching T<b>V</b> at home.
<b>Y</b>ou are lying.

She can't lie

Come on. Come on.
lt's a very proud day for our..
..village Shabrampur
and especially for me.
Today, Mr. Pratap <b>K</b>umar, a
student of this school..
..has not only made this district..
..but the entire
region proud in the entire..
..country with his
bravery and courage.
Now l would like
captain Pratap <b>K</b>umar..
..to come here and say a few
words of encouragement to our kids.
l want to say <b>j</b>ust one
thing to all you kids.
Don't ever be ashamed of your caste.
A person's caste
doesn't make him good or bad.
His deeds make him good or bad.
Sir has taught me this.
My parents passed
away in my childhood.
Since then, he has
raised and brought me up.
Whatever l am today
is all thanks to him.
Pratap, l want to ask
for something from you.
l hope that you won't turn me down.
Sir..
- Forget my daughter.
<b>Y</b>ou've endured a lot of
pain and sorrow so far.
<b>Y</b>ou can figure out from your past..
..how cruel the life
in this village is.
Here the entire family
has to pay the price..
..for the mistake made by one.
<b>27</b> years ago l had the
strength to fight the world.
Perhaps that's why l
could bring you home.
<b>B</b>ut today, l'm very weak. l'm old.
l won't be able to fight today.
l have <b>tw</b>o other
daughters besides Geeta.
lf you got married to Geeta,..
..the socie<b>ty</b> will make
their lives miserable.
Let alone getting married.
lt will be di<b>ff</b>icult for them to
even venture out of the house.
Such girls either hang
themselves on a fan..
..or <b>j</b>ump into a well..
..or at brothels..
Son, this hea<b>rt</b> has
always given you blessings.
Don't force it to
curse you. Forget Geeta.
l would think that l got my fees.
Pratap, why have you
come back to remind me..
..what l have forgotten years ago<b>?</b>
l <b>j</b>ust want the
answers to my <b>q</b>uestions.
<b>Y</b>our husband wasn't at home on
the night of the <b>26</b>th of <b>O</b>ctober.
And you know where he was.
l don't know an<b>yt</b>hing.
<b>Y</b>our eyelids are batting again.
Pratap, you've to listen to this.
That SlM we found in
the car that day..
..belongs to someone
named Roshini Sukul.
Her father's name is
Thakur <b>O</b>mkar Sukul.
He is an e<b>x</b>-minister of this place.
He is now a headman.
All the ministers
here are in his pocket.
<b>B</b>race yourself.
This investigation
is going to get ugly.
That's fine.
lt's good that you came.
Who is Thakur <b>O</b>mkar Sukul<b>?</b>
The C<b>B</b>l o<b>ff</b>icials are here.
l'm sorry. We came to
your house uninvited.
<b>Y</b>es.
Call your daughter
Roshini out please.
She wanted to ask us something..
..about the three missing boys.
<b>Y</b>ou knucklehead.
Are you stupid<b>?</b>
<b>Y</b>ou're asking where my
daughter is in my own house.
<b>Y</b>ou won't get to meet Roshini.
Do whatever you can.
Thakur sir, don't take my
decency to be my weakness.
We've ce<b>rt</b>ain evidence
on the basis on which..
..l can even arrest
Roshini if l want to.
Here's the warrant.
l clean my bottom in the
morning with papers like these.
<b>B</b>ottom.
<b>O</b>nly what l say
becomes the law here.
Take her away if you have the guts.
l shall change my name if
these guys don't rip you apa<b>rt</b>.
Let's go.
Take o<b>ff</b> as soon as you can.
They've found evidence.
lf l lost it, l'll shove the
evidence down your throat.
<b>Y</b>ou'll be left wincing.
What<b>?</b> What are you staring at<b>?</b>
Get lost.
<b>Y</b>ou C<b>B</b>l's sycophant. <b>O</b>ut.
<b>Y</b>ou move, you die.
Ask your men to lower their guns.
Lower your guns.
Now tell me who the
sycophant is. Who is it<b>?</b> Come on.
l am.
- l did not hear you.
Say it loudly.
- Pratap, what madness is this<b>?</b>
Leave him.
l did not hear you. Say it loudly.
l am..
- Pratap, it's an order.
Come on, let's go.
Pick him up. Hurry up.
ls he okay<b>?</b>
What is wrong with you<b>?</b>
We are sent here to find
the evidence and witnesses.
So that we can present a
strong case in the cou<b>rt</b>.
And that gun has been
given to us for our protection.
We have to give an account
for every bullet that we fire.
There's a system to
the way we work. <b>O</b>h, God.
There are protocols to be followed.
Here the system is that if someone
abuses you, rip his tongue out.
And if someone's
word is the final word..
..then you've to keep your gun
in his mouth <b>24</b> hours a day.
<b>Y</b>ou don't play on fire.
<b>Y</b>ou play with fire.
That's the way l work.
Don't tell me your way of working.
l know e<b>x</b>actly what l am doing.
<b>Y</b>ou were sent here to help me.
Not to argue with me.
<b>K</b>eshav.
- <b>Y</b>es. - From Delhi, l need..
..one senior lady inspector
and at least <b>50</b> policemen. Armed.
<b>Y</b>es, sir.
- <b>B</b>y <b>8:00</b> am tomorrow.
Come please.
What's his name<b>?</b>
- Lakshman Halwai. - Lakshman..
What's this.. <b>Y</b>ou have also..
Hello. <b>Y</b>es. ls there..
l'm senior inspector
Te<b>j</b>aswani Alahawat. - <b>O</b>ne minute.
We have come to take
Roshini into custody.
Please co-operate or
else we will have to..
..take her along with force.
Roshini.
Leave me.
<b>O</b>n the night of the <b>26</b>th <b>O</b>ctober,
you were with those boys.
Here's your mobile that was
obtained from their vehicle.
According to the phone records..
..you made your last
<b>17</b> calls to those guys.
Do you want to say
an<b>yt</b>hing in your defense<b>?</b>
Look, the story is very simple.
Dinu used to love you..
..and you used to pretend to
love him, <b>j</b>ust to have fun.
<b>Y</b>our family fi<b>x</b>ed your
marriage with a rich man..
..and you happily accepted it.
When Dinu learnt about it..
..he came to your village
with his friends to meet you.
lf Dinu had revealed the
truth about you here..
..then your family's reputation
would've been completely ruined.
And to save yourself
from this disgrace..
..you, along with
your family, killed..
..Dinu, Dhiresh and Gautam.
That's not true.
l didn't kill anyone.
<b>Y</b>ou see this earring<b>?</b>
l have many such proofs..
..to take you and your
family to the gallows.
The truth is that
you got Dinu killed.
How can l kill Dinu<b>?</b>
l used to love him.
Dinu was the
brightest boy in the school.
That's why he even got a seat
in a medical college in Delhi.
l thought..
..once he becomes a doctor,
my family will accept him.
<b>B</b>ut they were all
against this relationship.
That's why they fi<b>x</b>ed my
marriage with <b>V</b>i<b>j</b>ay Singh.
When l told Dinu about this,
he came to our village..
..along with some of
his friends to meet me.
That night, there was 'Ram
Leela' <b>(</b>Play about Lord Ram<b>)</b>.
Hail Lord Ram Chandra.
- Hail the Lord.
Lord Ram went to
Lanka and defeated Ravan.
Ram is going back
to Ayodhya as a hero.
With a smile on his face
and a bow on his shoulder.
People were hailing Ram
after Ravan was killed in Lanka.
Following Ram was his
loyal brother Lakshman.
They were talking about Ram
and Sita in every village.
People came in hordes at the place
at which Ram went with his army.
l am very worried, Dinu.
- Why are you getting worried<b>?</b>
They are my closest friends.
Dhiresh and Gautam.
Their families have
great influence in Delhi.
<b>Y</b>es, once we reach Delhi,
we are out of danger.
What if my father learns about it<b>?</b>
<b>B</b>y that time we will be married.
They have made all the arrangements.
As soon as we reach Delhi, we
will get married in the cou<b>rt</b>.
Gautam, take left.
- <b>Y</b>es.
Someone is following us.
- Hey, you look in the front.
Who are they<b>?</b>
Why are you scaring me<b>?</b>
l told you.. Father
won't spare us now.
<b>Y</b>ou.. Nothing will happen.
Drive faster.
- l'm doing that.
Take a look at this.
Come. Come out.
- Papa.
Papa. Papa, leave me.
Dinu. - Aren't you
ashamed to do this<b>?</b> - Dinu.
Papa, let me go. Leave me. Papa.
Get in.
- Papa.
Dinu.
That's all.
l don't know
an<b>yt</b>hing more than that.
My family kept me locked
in a room for <b>tw</b>o months.
Do you remember anyone's face<b>?</b>
They were in police uniforms.
And they had high-power
torches in their hands.
l couldn't see
anyone's face properly.
l could only hear their names.
A<b>j</b>ad Shatru and Saitu.
Can you identi<b>fy</b> any of them<b>?</b>
Sir. Sir. Sir.
- Sir.
Sir. Sir.
Sir, is it true that
headman <b>O</b>mkar Sukul's daughter..
..Roshini Sukul is the
prime witness of this case<b>?</b>
Right now the
investigation is going on.
<b>O</b>nce the repo<b>rt</b> is filed,
all of you will know about it.
Sir. Sir. Please, sir. Case..
My driver Hariya. He is
working for me since <b>20</b> years.
And his father.. He
was my father's driver.
There was no
problem at all till date.
We treat him like a
member of our family.
lf my son gets
carried away tomorrow..
..and marries a 'Dalit' girl..
..then l, along with
the people of my caste..
..will sacrifice him with pride.
Which three boys<b>?</b> Have
you seen them<b>?</b> - Sir. Sir.
Not <b>j</b>ust you, none of us
have seen them. - Sir. Sir.
Why don't you understand<b>?</b>
lt's a conspiracy..
..of the central government to
defame the state government.
Why do you worry<b>?</b>
<b>O</b>nce our pa<b>rty</b> comes in
power in the central government..
..we will show who
has the upper hand.
We believe that the truth always
comes out victorious. Goodbye.
What happened<b>?</b>
- What was there to happen<b>?</b>
We went in and came out.
What did the girl say<b>?</b>
- What would she say<b>?</b>
She was confused like
Gandhari <b>(</b>M<b>yt</b>hological character<b>)</b>.
The C<b>B</b>l scared her a lot
before presenting her.
She won't recogni<b>z</b>e anyone,
will she<b>?</b> - How can she<b>?</b>
<b>B</b>ut the C<b>B</b>l failed completely.
- Really<b>?</b>
Their faces turned pale.
lt will be fun when people
will shout Shame, Shame at them.
<b>O</b>kay, listen. There's an
army of <b>j</b>ournalists outside.
<b>K</b>eep both your mouth
and temper in control.
These stupid <b>j</b>ournalists.
These C<b>B</b>l people who are
walking around with pride..
..are the ones who should
be taken to the gallows.
Sir.
- Sir.
Sir, is it true that the
police is also involved in this..
..and that they are trying
to protect the real culprit<b>?</b>
And the C<b>B</b>l commander is a member
of the untouchable communi<b>ty?</b>
ls that true, sir<b>?</b>
Were you the one to frame Dinu<b>?</b>
Some people even think
that the police is behind..
..the disappearance of the
three guys. <b>Y</b>our comment<b>?</b>
Move back.
- Tell us. - Move back.
Sir, Roshini has taken your
name during the C<b>B</b>l investigation<b>?</b>
There are many persons in
the village with that name. Go.
<b>Y</b>es, but there must be only one
policeman with that name, right<b>?</b>
Move back. Will you get inside now<b>?</b>
Move<b>!</b> Go away<b>!</b>
Take this.
Move back. No one saw an<b>yt</b>hing here.
Policeman<b>!</b> Please help me<b>!</b>
Why are you beating me up<b>?</b>
What wrong have l done<b>?</b>
l am sorry, <b>B</b>rother.
Don't beat me up, <b>B</b>rother.
Let me go.
Many of our people were kidnapped.
Many of them were killed.
We saw their families' pain..
..but we couldn't muster the
courage to feel their pain.
We <b>j</b>ust keep worrying about
our own lives like cowards.
We weren't strong
enough to fight them.
<b>B</b>ut we have to unite now..
..for our children.. for Dinu..
The atrocities that we
have been facing since ages..
..we will have to raise
our voice against them.
Hey, l heard that
your wife is gorgeous.
Let me have her someday as well.
Hey, Manka. Hey, listen.
Don't go home this evening.
<b>Y</b>our sister's alone at home.
l will go there.
Come on, it's time.
Sta<b>rt</b> the commotion. l will
stop from behind. - <b>O</b>kay, sir.
Hey, move.
Hey, give it to me. Give it to me.
Leave it. Leave it.
Move.
Leave it.
Come on. Leave it.
Hey, leave it. Leave it.
Hey, leave it. Leave it.
Leave it. Leave it.
Stop right there.
The way to the cou<b>rt</b> is closed.
All of you go home.
All of you go home.
lt's my order. Go.
Charge.
We are taking precaution.
Leave me. Leave me.
All are from the C<b>B</b>l, sir.
We.. <b>O</b>ne minute.
The cou<b>rt</b>'s verdict is that
the investigation o<b>ff</b>icers..
..don't have any reason to
keep Roshini Sukul in custody.
Since the girl couldn't identi<b>fy</b>..
..anyone in pa<b>rt</b>icular
in the re<b>q</b>uired time..
..she is permitted to go home.
The investigation
o<b>ff</b>icers were unable to prove..
..that the missing boys were killed.
And if they were killed,
where are the dead bodies<b>?</b>
Who killed them<b>?</b> And what is
the reason behind their killing<b>?</b>
Due to lack of
concrete evidence against..
..SP A<b>z</b>ad Shatru Singh
and other police o<b>ff</b>icers..
..the cou<b>rt</b> ac<b>q</b>uits them.
During the course of this case,
the investigation o<b>ff</b>icers..
..recorded statements
of many new witnesses..
..but they completely failed to
present any witness in the cou<b>rt</b>.
The investigation
o<b>ff</b>icers are found guil<b>ty</b> of..
..misusing their power and
also the government resources.
<b>O</b>ther than that they are
also found guil<b>ty</b> of..
..increasing tension
amongst the public..
..and sensationali<b>z</b>ing this
case with the help of media.
The cou<b>rt</b> gives them a
strict warning regarding this.
And if they are so
desperate to be on T<b>V</b>..
..they could work in
some melodramatic T<b>V</b> serial.
They will become
heroes on their own.
This case is dismissed right here.
My <b>B</b>rothers, ours is the only
country in the whole world..
..where we have to fill our name,
caste and religion..
..on every application and form.
This classification of
castes has not been done today.
lt's been there since several years.
<b>O</b>ur ancestors
classified us among castes..
..according to our occupations.
Power. Power. Power.
Power. Power. Power.
Power. Power. Power. Power.

Sir, please try to understand.
This is not <b>j</b>ust about
Dinu and his friends anymore.
Now it's about the
age-old disparities..

discrimination. This is the limit.
<b>Y</b>ou have already wasted a huge
amount of time and money of the C<b>B</b>l.
Close the case. Shut the o<b>ff</b>ice.
This en<b>q</b>uiry is over.
<b>E</b>very fool thinks that on

l have to commend you
on one thing though.
<b>Y</b>ou are a great wife.
Good lndian wife..
..who puts up with whatever
nonsense her husband dishes out.
That's why every man
wants a wife like you.
And it's not di<b>ff</b>icult either.
<b>J</b>ust marry a timid girl.
She will do whatever you say.
<b>Y</b>ou are like those grandmas.
l wish you could understand
that a woman is not <b>j</b>ust a wife..
..but also someone's
mother and sister.
Think about what the mothers and..
..sisters of those three
boys must be going through.
<b>O</b>nly then will you
reali<b>z</b>e their pain.
Sorry. l didn't come
here to lecture you.
l <b>j</b>ust came to tell

so l got rid of him.
<b>B</b>ut he thought of going
to Delhi to be a doctor..
..come back and marry my daughter..
..and then become a
'Thakur' <b>(</b>Landlord<b>)</b>.
<b>Y</b>ou were born in filth, but
you dream of becoming a king.

Hey. Hey, Pappu. <b>E</b>nough.

And that, too, with great pressure.
Now think what ne<b>x</b>t. What ne<b>x</b>t.

Hey, didn't you feel ashamed of
yourself to suppo<b>rt</b> this fool<b>?</b>
lf you really wanted to help him..
..you could've sent
your sister away with him.
'And Sachin Tendulkar,
both are in sublime form..'
Don't listen to your hea<b>rt</b>.
The hea<b>rt</b> has a hundred wishes.
lt will eventually lead to your
destruction and that'll be it.
Have you heard that saying<b>?</b>
Do you know its meaning<b>?</b>
lt's very easy.
The one who follows his hea<b>rt</b>,

lf l leave this place alive, l

<b>Y</b>ou want to leave this
place alive or not<b>?</b> - <b>Y</b>es. <b>Y</b>es.
Then you didn't see Dinu dying here.
<b>Y</b>ou saw him running away.
And why did Dinu run<b>?</b>
Why<b>?</b> - <b>B</b>ecause Roshini
refused to run away..
..with a wo<b>rt</b>hless fellow
like Dinu. What happened then<b>?</b>
What<b>?</b> - Dinu said that
he would commit suicide..
..without the girl and ran towards
the <b>j</b>ungle like a madman. - <b>Y</b>es.
We will <b>j</b>ust say what you tell
us to, sir. Please let us go, sir.
Hurray. lt's a four.
He smashed that one.

- Go and sit there. Go.
Stupid batsman<b>!</b> The
whole country is corrupt<b>!</b>
Look at him. He missed

He missed a century again.
Here, <b>99</b> and <b>100</b>.
Here, the century is over.
lG sir, they are from

They would've opened their
