Today you're 5
and l want to tell you the truth.
You're not my son and l didn't find
you in the sea, it was all lies.
You're not a liar, but l am.
l enjoy telling lies.
Are you sorry to find out
you're not my son,
that l'm neither your father
or mother ?
lt all started
because of a ram's hide.
There was a talking ram,
it was divine.
Hermes gave the ram to Nefele
so she could save her sons.
lno wanted to kill them.
lno was the wife of Cadmo
and second wife of Atamante.
Atamante was the son of Eolo,
the wind god,
lno had also been Eolo's wife.
Anyway ,
it was all a matter of jealousy.
The ram had a golden fleece
and managed to carry Frisso,
one of Nefele's sons, across the sea.
Frisso arrived in the city of Ea:
ruled by Eta, the sun's son.
Ea welcomed Frisso
and to give thanks to Zeus,
sacrificed the golden ram.
Eolo's descendants
wanted to get the fleece back,
because it brought the king luck.
lt guaranteed
a long and peaceful reign.
They tried everything to get it back,
but they didn't succeed.
They didn't succeed.
Little boy,
you are a descendant of Eolo
because you are
a grandson of Atamanta,
who was king of Olco,
a city nearby.
lt was rich with sheep and grain,
all the property of the king.
Your Uncle Pelia imprisoned
your father and usurped the throne.
The kingdom awaits you
and l've kept you safe here.
Have you understood ?
lt's a rather complicated story
because it made up of facts,
not thoughts.
Everything's sacred,
everything's sacred.
Remember, my boy:
there's nothing natural in nature.
When it seems natural to you,
it'll be the end.
Something else will start.
Good-bye sky, good-bye sea.
What a beautiful sky !
Close...
Happy...
Don't you think
that just a little piece is natural ?
That it could be possessed by a god ?
The sea too.
On this day, when you're 13
and fish with your feet in the water.
Look behind you, what do you see ?
Anything natural ?
What you see is an apparition.
With clouds reflected
in the still, heavy water
at three in the afternoon.
Look at that black streak on the sea,
shining and pink like oil.
The shadows of the trees
and the reeds.
A god is hidden everywhere you look.
lf he isn't, he's left traces
of his scared presence:
the silence, the smell of grass,
the chill of fresh water.
Yes, everything's sacred.
But sanctity is also a curse.
Whilst the gods love, they also hate.
Maybe you think that besides
being a liar, l'm also too poetic.
But for ancient man, myths and rituals
are concrete experiences,
which are even included
in his daily existence.
For him, reality
is a totally perfect unit,
and the emotion he feels at the sight
of a summer sky, for example,
equals the more internal, personal
experiences of modern man.
You'll go to your Uncle, who stole
your throne, and reclaim your rights.
To eliminate you,
he'll have to come up with an excuse.
He'll send you on a quest,
maybe to retrieve the golden fleece.
That way, you'll travel
to a distant land across the sea.
You'll experience things in a world
we can only imagine.
Life there is very realistic.
Because only he who is mythical
is realistic and vice versa.
This is what
our divine reason foresees.
That which it can't foresee, sadly,
are the errors it will lead you to.
Who knows how many there'll be ?
That which man has witnessed
in the cultivation of grains,
that which he has understood
from seeds as they are reborn,
represents a definite lesson:
the resurrection.
But this lesson no longer useful.
That which he has gleaned from seeds
holds no more meaning for you.
lt's like a distant memory
that no longer affects you.
ln fact, there are no gods.
Give life to the seed
and be reborn with the seed.
Wait for me here.
Dear uncle,
l have come to reclaim my kingdom.
l'll give it back, but you give me
something for the communal good.
- What do you mean ?
- There's a symbol of the perrenity
of power and order.
This symbol is the golden fleece
of the sacred ram.
lt is to be found in a distant land,
across the sea
which no one has visited.
lf you bring the golden fleece
back to our city,
l'll give back the kingdom.
- What fine horses !
- Let's take them !
Here, pray for us !
Get me ready,
l want to go to the temple.
Come on, wake up !
- Come with me.
- Where ?
Come with me !
Help me steal the fleece.
What's happening ?
- What is it ?
- A woman's coming in a cart !
With a golden ram's fleece !
Don't be stupid !
Get the horses ready.
This place will cave in,
it has no support !
Don't pray to god
because he blesses your tents !
Don't repeat god's first act !
You don't search for the centre !
Don't mark the centre ! No !
Find a tree !
A staff ! A stone !
Earth, talk to me !
Let me hear your voice !
l no longer recall your voice.
Sun, talk to me !
Where is the place
in which l can hear your voice ?
Earth, talk to me ! Sun, talk to me !
Perhaps you're disappearing !
l no longer hear what you say !
You, grass, talk to me !
You, rock, talk to me !
Earth, where are you ?
Where can l find you again ?
Where is the bond
that joined you to the sun ?
My feet touch the ground
and l don't recognize it.
My eyes look at the sun
and l don't recognize it.
Today you will experience
something unexpected.
You'll find out that kings are not
always obliged to keep promises.
l understand. Here it is.
Keep the fleece, symbol
of the perennity of power and order.
My quest has shown me
the world is bigger than your kingdom.
lf you want, l'll tell you
what l think the truth is:
away from that land,
this fleece has no meaning.
Good.
lt's time to separate.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Jason !
Jason !
Why are you here ?
- Why are you here ?
''- You mean why are ''''we'''' here ?''
- lt's a vision !
- lf so, you are causing it.
- We are inside you.
- l only knew one centaur.
You knew two.
A sacred one, when you were a boy
and a desecrated one
when you became an adult.
But the sacred part
is kept alongside the desecrated form.
Here we are, one beside the other.
What's the purpose of the old centaur
l knew as a child ?
The one that you, new centaur,
replaced without banishing.
He doesn't speak
because we can't understand his logic.
But l will speak for him.
lt's under his sign that you,
despite your plans,
love Medea.
- l love Medea.
- Yes.
You pity her too
and understand her spiritual crisis,
her disorientation as an ancient woman
in a world that ignores all
she ever believed in.
The poor thing's
had a conversion in reverse.
- She hasn't recovered.
- How does knowing this help me ?
lt doesn't. lt's reality.
Why are you telling me this ?
Because nothing can stop the old
centaur from inspiring feelings
and nothing can stop the new one
from expressing them.
Wet nurse, come with me.
- Hurry, wet nurse. Come with me.
- Where ?
- To Corinth.
- But you can't !
Come with me.
Why have you decided
to resign yourself like this ?
What should l do ?
- They say.
- What ?
That in your homeland,
you could work miracles.
Dominate air, fire. At least that's
what the Corinthians say.
- They're frightened of you.
- Frightened ?
Like a magician.
Sorry, but they say that
in the hope of helping you,
pushing you.
To work magic ?
l've been away
from my homeland for 10 years.
- You're still what you were.
- No.
l'm another creature now,
l've forgotten everything.
- What was reality is so no longer.
- Perhaps,
if you wanted,
you could recall your god.
Perhaps you're right,
l've remained as l was.
A vessel full of knowledge
that is not mine.
- Don't you recognize me ?
- Yes !
You're my father's father.
What are you waiting for ?
Be brave !
Oh god ! Oh justice dear to god !
Oh sunlight !
The victory l foresee over my enemies
will be marvellous !
Now l will go straight to the sign !
l'll avenge myself as l must !
Oh god ! Oh justice dear to god !
Oh sunlight !
Listen to my plans.
One of my women will tell Jason
to come to me.
l'll will be loving and tell him:
''''''You must marry the king's daughter''''.''
''l'll tell him: ''''This marriage''
''will be useful to our sons''''.''
Oh god ! Oh justice dear to god !
Oh sunlight !
As you have revealed your plans,
we want to be useful
and advise you to remember
the most sacred human laws.
l can no longer act differently.
You can't sympathise
because you've not suffered like me.
Who'll give you the courage
to do what you have in mind ?
Who'll give it to you ?
l'll find the courage in thinking
about his destruction.
But it won't help you,
poor desperate woman.
That's enough, wet nurse !
lt's time to act !
This chatter is useless.
Go and fetch Jason.
But don't tell him of our plans.
You love me ! And you're a woman !
ln your old robes, Medea,
in your old robes.
Children, come here !
You wanted me to come.
Here l am. What is it ?
Take these robes
and give them to Glauce
for her wedding.
Tell her that l do not hate her
and wish her well.
Now take your father's hand,
he'll take you to her.
Forget all past bitterness
towards him,
as l have done.
We have made peace.
Come on, children.
Take him by the hand.
l have a dark presentiment of pain.
Children,
you will live long lives
and grip your father's hand.
Poor me.
l do nothing but cry
and suffer dreadful anguish.
Just as l have decided to finish
my undignified disagreement
with your father.
Here l am, crying.
Don't repent for what you've done,
it's natural for you to be mad at me.
But now it seems
that wisdom prevails inside you.
Children,
now you know your father
has been thinking of your future.
Together with your brothers, you will
occupy first place in this city.
Why are you still crying ?
Don't concern yourself.
Woman is weak and cries easily.
Promise me you'll beg the bride
to convince the king
not to banish our children.
Don't worry, l'll do it.
Quickly ! Go now !
lf you're lucky, as l hope,
you'll return with the happy news
that we're expecting.
Let's go.
Mama sends you this gift
for your wedding.
She says she doesn't hate you,
but wishes you well.
You cannot accept this gift,
listen to us !
Thank your mother and tell her
l am pleased with this gift.
Dress me.
What a beautiful wedding dress !
Come with me.
l was looking for you.
Don't look at me like that,
full of anger towards your husband.
You must leave this city,
together with your sons. Now !
l am personally interested
in your exile
and l won't go home until you
are banished from my kingdom.
Why my sons too ?
Because you frighten me.
l'm afraid for my daughter,
and l tell you openly.
Everyone here knows
you are an expert in spells,
because you came from a barbaric land.
You are different from us,
so we don't want you here.
My knowledge of these things
is very poor.
And then, why should l be offended
by your words ?
Only he is responsible,
my husband !
l am not hurt by your behaviour.
ln fact, it seems just.
l am not even hurt by your happiness !
Go ahead with the wedding !
Be happy ! l just ask a single favour.
Don't banish me, leave me here.
- l will bow my head.
- Your words are sweet.
But it is impossible to look
into the depths of a soul.
lt is true. This is true.
Give me at least a day
to think about the exile,
and to ask help for my children
now that their father
has completely abandoned them.
Unfortunately, my will is not ruthless
like that of a tyrant.
My indolence
has often been my downfall.
l know l'm making a mistake,
but l want to grant your request.
l want to tell you the truth.
lt is not for hatred,
nor for suspicion of your diversity
that l am afraid.
lt's for fear of what
you could do to my daughter.
She feels guilty about you.
And knowing you suffer,
she cannot rest.
For her, this marriage to Jason
is cause for grief as well as joy.
You are without blame, and so that
your presence cannot oppress her,
l want to banish you from my realm !
Ma'am ! Ma'am !
Wet nurse, please go and call Jason.
My right,
gripped many times by your hands.
My knees,
embraced uselessly so many times !
By this miserable man
who owes me everything
and over whom l have lost all hope.
lt's time you understood
that l owe the results
of my efforts to myself.
You'll never admit it,
but that which you did for me,
you did for the love of my body.
You say that l'm ungrateful,
but l, maybe without effort
or even realization,
gave you much more
than l received in return.
Don't boast about this.
You summoned me. Here l am,
l'll listen to you willingly,
even though you hate me.
So, what news is there ?
No news.
l only wanted you to pardon me.
l know that l am destined
for a friendless exile
and that all else is now useless.
l was unjust and you were right
to behave as you did.
Pardon you ? Yes, l pardon you.
lt's that l ask of you before l leave.
Thank you. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Children, come here.
Take these robes
and give to Glauce for her wedding.
Tell her that mama does not hate her
and wishes her well.
Take your father by the hand,
he will take you to her.
Forget all past bitterness between us,
as l have done.
We have made peace.
Come on, take him by the hand.
l have a dark presentiment of pain.
You will live long lives
and grip your father's hand.
Poor me, l can do nothing but cry
and suffer dreadful anguish.
Just as l have decided to finish
this undignified disagreement,
here l am crying.
lt's natural for you to be mad at me.
You boys can be certain that your
father has thought of your future.
With your new brothers, you will
occupy first place in this city.
Why are you still crying ?
Don't worry, woman is a weak creature
and cries easily.
But promise me you'll beg the bride
to convince her father
not to banish our children.
Don't worry, l'll do it.
Good-bye.
Go. lf you are fortunate, as l wish,
you'll return with the happy news
that we're expecting.
Mama sends you this gift
for your wedding.
She says she does not hate you,
and wishes you well.
Thank your mother and tell her
that l am pleased with her gift.
Your highness !
Your highness !
Come, it's time to sleep.
- Just a while longer !
- Behave yourself, come on !
Get down ! Be good.
Down.
There, all done.
What a good boy you are.
Now let's go to bye-byes.
Let's go.
Climb into my arms.
Come on, let's go.
Get down.
Come on.
Darling.
Sleep, be good.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Darling.
Why do you try
to pass through the fire ?
You can't do it !
lt's useless to try !
You can talk to me if you want,
but l don't want you near me.
What have you done ?
- Aren't you suffering too now ?
- l want to suffer !
Your own god will condemn you !
- What do you want from me ?
- Let me bury my children.
- Go and bury your bride.
- l'll go !
But without my two children !
The tears you shed now are nothing !
You'll realize when you're old !
Please, in the name of your god !
Let me caress those poor,
innocent bodies !
Don't keep insisting ! lt's useless !
Nothing is possible any more !
