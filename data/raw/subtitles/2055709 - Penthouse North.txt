I'd do it, though.
Alright.
Let me get my coat

I'd rather do it myself.
OK.
OK, sure.

Good. I'm glad

You spend way too much time hiding

My God, what's wrong
with hiding out?
Don't make me feel guilty
for finding a guy I like.
- SARA: Stop busting my chops.

You and Danny gonna come over
and ring in the New Year with us?
Danny had to pull a double

so he'll have to sleep
for a couple of hours.
- Please try and make it.
- We will.
Just gonna be
a little last-minute, OK?

OK. Remember...
Sara wants us
to be there before midnight
to watch the fireworks
from Ryan's penthouse.
(Swans)
What?
Something not right
about that guy.
Danny... What'd you do?
I ran a check on him.
You did what?
He said he was living in Philly
before Brooklyn, right?
According to DMV records, he was
in Miami the last seven years.
No, I think he said
he was born in Philly.
He was born
in Dade County, Florida.
So we'll ask him
and find out.
Lots of people make up stories
about themselves.
I know. I arrest them
all the time.

Wouldn't be the first time
me and Ryan shared the same...

- What?!
What?
I'm sorry.
Are you OK now?
Yeah. Just...
These are really tight.
Are you gonna help me, Sara?
Yeah. Yes.

- You're welcome.
So, what did Ryan tell you about
himself?
- How'd he make his money?
- He's an investor.
(CHUCKLES)
Ryan wasn't an investor.
Ryan was a goddamn thief.
He stole something
that belongs to me,
and I'm here
to get it back.
- Where is it?
- What?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
I wonder if I believe that.
I would tell you if I knew.
Where's my money, Sara?

I don't want to hurt you.
But I will.
I'll hurt you bad.

Hey, Hollander. Yeah,

I had to kill him.
There wasn't time.
You know how fast he is.
Only this time,
I was faster.
I know I kinda screwed up, OK?
But I got the girl,
and I'll get the truth
if I have to carve it
out of her.
You don't have to do that,
Hollander. I got this covered.
I got this under control.
Yeah, OK. OK. (HANGS UP)

Well, this is...
this is not good, Sara.
Not good for you,
not good for me.
Listen to me.
Do you want to die today, Sara?
- Is that what you want?
- No. No.
Then you tell me
where Ryan hid the shit
and maybe we both
get out of this alive.
- You want me to help you?
- Yes.

- Uh-huh.
My boyfriend's apartment.
He killed my boyfriend.
Where's the apartment?
260 Blackwood, Penthouse North.
OK. Now, I'm gonna have to
call this in. Just a second.
OK?
Hi. Yeah, this is
ADA Robert Shay.
I'm with a young woman
who's a victim of an assault.
Her name is Sara Frost.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Apparently, there's a homicide
involved as well,
at 260 Blackwood,
Penthouse North.
Just a second.
Ah. It's the boyfriend. Yeah.
OK. Oh, great. OK. Thanks.
Great. I got it.
Thank you very much.
OK. There's a unit.
It's a block away.
The police are gonna meet us

Here we are.
Are the police here yet?
They'll be here any second.
May I use your phone

Very interesting day, Chad.
Very interesting.
Let's see -
first, you killed Ryan,
before we had a chance to get
any information out of him.
And then you let
a 118-pound blind girl
make a fool out of you.
That's not how it happened.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's how it happened.
It's exactly how it happened, Chad.
Just like that.
Let's face it.
You're kind of a fuck-up.
Aren't you?
You're also a mess.
Go clean yourself up.Go ahead.
Go on.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Look... so you know,
the only thing -
honestly, the only thing -
standing between you and
that psychopath in there is me.
That's it.
OK?
Well. Alright, huh?
Yeah, it's kinda like
your own little fortress.
Just you and Ryan up here
where nobody can touch you.
Wasn't gonna last.
I was always
gonna find you.
Find me?
Well, Ryan.
(SIGHS) And whoever else
was lucky enough to be with him.
What do you want?
What are you gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
I don't know.
I guess whatever it takes.
That's what I'm gonna do.
Whatever it takes.
Wow. You know,
I know you can't see this.
But this view, I mean...
This view is drop-dead.
Hey, did you ever wonder
how a young guy like Ryan
could ever even afford
a place like this?
He had money.
Yeah. He had money.
Did he ever say anything
about Miami?
- Miami?
- Uh-huh.
Big city. Florida.
He used to live there.
Anything else?
He said he got involved
with some very bad people
down there.
Really?
- Yeah.
- (CAT MIAOWS)
- (MIAows)
- Hey.
Who's this?
What's the name
of your cat?
Shadow.
Shadow. Hey, Shadow.
Aren't you a pretty girl?
Funny. I didn't figure Ryan
as a cat guy.
What is wrong with you?
Ryan is dead. That animal
in the next room murdered him.
You think you knew Ryan.
Let me ask you something.
If Ryan was such a choirboy,
what was he doing in business
with the likes of Chad and me?
It's here. Somewhere.
Ryan would never let it
get out of his reach.
He'd keep it close by.
You know where it is.
Don't you think I would have
told that psychopath
anything I knew
once he put his hands on me?
Chad likes the rough stuff.
Ryan too, actually.
Was that it? Was that your thing?
I'm not judging.
You don't know
anything about me.
See, actually, I do.
Google.
(READS) "Sara Frost.
"Promising young photojournalist
"embedded with US troops

Permanent.
What is that like?
Everything you loved,
everything gone

Are you one of those people
who thinks,
"Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger"?
Is that what you think?
I'd put a bullet
through my head.
(SOFTLY) Where is it, Sara?
CHAD: Ryan hid it good, Hollander,
but I know it's here.
Of course it's here, Chad.
And if you hadn't killed him,
we would've had it by now!
CHAD: Just give me five minutes
with her, I'll get the truth.
What if you lose control
like you did with Ryan?
- Won't happen, Hollander.
- What if you kill her?
CHAD: I won't.
HOLLANDER: OK.
But do not kill her.
- I mean it, Chad.
- No, don't.
Don't what?
Don't leave me
alone with him.
Too late, Sara.
I can't help you.

with this picture?
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Chad, your knuckles
are dragging.
I'll tell you what's wrong
with this picture.
This picture.
Everything else
in this pretentious apartment
is generic, soulless,
like Ryan.
Everything
but this photograph.
- One of yours, isn't it, Sara?
- Yeah.
HOLLANDER: Ryan blew it up
and framed it for you, right?
It's haunting.
Really disturbing.
It's beautiful.
Take it down.
Why?
Because I told you to.
Give me your blade.
Give me your knife.
You have a very unhealthy
attachment to this knife.
(CANVAS RIPS)
(LAUGHS) Sweet!
There's... there's gotta be...
two, three...

What?
SARA: So you got
what you came for.
Will you go now?
HOLLANDER: Sure. As soon as
Chad bags the cash.
That wasn't so bad.
It worked out for everybody.
- Except for Ryan.
- SARA: Was it worth it?
Killing him?
Tell you the truth,
I'm gonna miss old Ryan.
- He was a good investment.
- (KNIFE CLICKS)
You talk about him like he was
some sort of object, some thing.
Sara, Ryan betrayed
you AND me.
I know
what you're thinking.
"If I love that guy
long enough and hard enough,
"I could change him."
Never gonna happen.
Ryan was scum.
HOLLANDER: You couldn't see him
for what he really was.
You want me to do her?
HOLLANDER:
No, I don't want you to do her.
- CHAD: But she knows too much.
- HOLLANDER: What does she know?
She heard some voices and
some fake names. That's all.
Hey, Chad, not everything has
to end up in blood, alright?
Go wait for me
at the door.
Some other time, then, Sara.
Listen.
I know this was
tough on you.
You're a whole lot stronger than
you know.
Now, I don't want you
to leave the apartment
or call anybody
for an hour, OK?
An hour.
Yeah, now I get it.

he got this diamond?
He was buying diamonds.
He said they were investments.

- Where are the others?
- The others?
Yeah, I want my other 29
clear perfect diamonds.
$20 million worth
stolen in Miami.

ever do to you?
Gee, Chad,
when did you join PETA?

Yeah, you know...
Ryan may have been
a disloyal dog,
but at least he knew
when to keep his mouth shut.
- Yeah, well, Ryan's dead.
- You challenging me, Chad?
I'm just saying,
you want answers,
you don't go
throwing cats around.
HOLLANDER: You know,
maybe when you killed Ryan,
something happened
to your brain.
I don't know. Why don't you
go wait downstairs?
What? Leave you up here alone
to find the diamonds?
Why? Do you think
I'd sell you out?
I don't know. Would you?
Gee. I mean, Chad,
if you don't trust me...
You looking for this?

Chad, I'm deeply hurt

Drink this.
Why doesn't he just kill me?
Maybe I stopped him.
You're terrified of him.
You're his lapdog.
Like hell I am.
You don't get it, do you?
You have no idea
what he's gonna do to you.
- To me?
- Do the math.
$20 million divided by two?
Why would Hollander
cut you in
when he could take it all
for himself?
Oh...
You're way ahead of me,
aren't you?
I knew you were smart.
You're gonna kill him first,
aren't you?
Drink.
Help me, Chad,
and I will help you.
Really?
And then what will you do?
Whatever you want.
Kill him.
(DOOR CLOSES, LOCK CLICKS)
(DRILLING NOISE)
We gotta talk. Come on.
That Ryan.
Got some sense
of humour.
For a dead guy, I mean.
Diamonds weren't in the safe,
I'm guessing.
Yeah. I have a feeling
you knew that.
Which means...
...you're my only living link
to those rocks, Sara.
(BLOWS AIR)
Where's Chad?
Did you kill him already?
I put him outside.
Give us a chance to... be alone.
He's working up the nerve
to kill you, you know.
Yeah, he's thinking about it.
You maybe even helped him...
little bit.
You know what, Sara?
Behind that...
...very pretty face
and those soft green eyes,
you're not all that innocent.
Are you?
Let's you and I make a deal.
I tell you where the diamonds are
and you let me live.
And as a kicker...
...I let you keep this.
If you're anything like me,
cash it in.
I'm nothing like you.
You kill people.
Yeah. I mean...
The world's a slaughterhouse
full of pigs
who are just too stupid to see
when the axe comes down.
Take the offer.
You're making
a really big mistake, Sara.
You know, I can hear
something in your voice
that wasn't there before.
Really? What's that?
Desperation.
(GROANS)
HOLLANDER: Comfortable? Good.
Hold her shoulders down.
Please don't... Ah!
Please!
You know how this works?
Thirsty?
(SQUEALS)
(COUGHS)
(COUGHS)
You're not strong enough
for this, Sara. Nobody is.
Why don't you just tell me
what I need to know?
Go m hell! (COUGHS)
HOLLANDER: Where are they?
The diamonds?
(COUGHS)
HOLLAN DER:
Where are my diamonds?

BLAKE: A very pregnant lady
is downstairs.
We're right outside
the building.
- SARA: That's my sister.
- Put some clothes on.
- We're coming up!
- Oh, please.
Let me call her back.
I can stop them.
(BLAKE INHALES DEEPLY)
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.
I don't trust her.
You know what that is?
I won't even blink
before I kill them.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
- Their lives
for the diamonds, Sara. -Yes.
(GROANS)
Hon? You alright?
(DOORBELL RINGS)
You want that baby
to be born, Sara?
(BLAKE KNOC KS) Hello?
OK. Hold on.
BLAKE: Hey, Sara.
Sorry. It's not a good time
to come here right now.
- Why not?
- I should have called.
BLAKE: What's going on?
We're in the middle
of a fight.
- A fight?
- He didn't hit you, did he?
- No.
- If he laid...
- No, Danny. He didn't lay...
- Where is he?
...a hand on me, OK?
We just need to be alone
so we can work it out.
OK?
Well, you don't
expect us to leave.
It's almost midnight.
BLAKE: We want to
be here with you.
Blake, please...
BLAKE: Sara.
What's going on?
We're just fighting.
BLAKE: Wh... Where's Ryan?
Ryan, we need to talk, man!
Right now, Ryan!
I need to see your face.
SARA: No, listen. This is...
This is just between us. OK?
We're here, we're in it,
and we're not leaving.
Please. Just leave.
No. Sara, look,
we're not gonna... (GROANS)
Honey? Are you OK?
- BLAKE: No. Oh, no.
- Blake?
- Blake?
- Oh, shit. I think...
(GROANS) on, shit.
Sara, let us in and call 911.
- No!
- She must lie down. Let us in.
- I can't.
- For Godsakes, Sara...
- I can't, Danny!
- Stop! No, OK, Danny, stop.
- Honey, you need to lie down.
- No, I...
Oh. Oh, shit. What I need to do
is get to the hospital.
OK? I'm not having this baby
right here.
DANNY: OK, we'll get a cab.
- I'll be there soon.
- Yes, just...
- University Hospital.
- SARA: OK.
- (LIFT DOOR CLOSES)
- I'll see you soon.
Looks like
you're gonna be an aunt.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for a drink.
See if Ryan has
any decent Scotch.
With ice. Lots of ice.
HOLLANDER: Alright.
We kept our part of the bargain.
Where are they, Sara?
Ryan never told me.
What?
But I think I know
where they are.
Oh, what, you think?
What is this, huh?
Hey! Which part of "Make me
a drink" don't you understand?
Where?
Terrace.
Terrace.
It was one night
last summer.
I woke up. It was about 2:00
in the morning.
Ryan wasn't in bed, but I heard him
making some noise out here.
When I came out,
I sensed something wasn't right.
He said he couldn't sleep
and I should go back to bed.
But I could still...
I could still hear him.
When he came to bed,
I could smell dirt on his hands,
and I think... l think he was
hiding something in the pots.
(TAP RUNS)
There must be
a hundred pots out here.
Could take a long time,
couldn't it, Sara?
(POT SMASH ES LOU DLY)
(TAP RUNS)
Is that the idea? Huh?
Kinda... run out the clock?
- (SARA SCREAMS)
- (TAP RUNS)
(POT SMASHES OUTSIDE)
Maybe somebody's gonna come
save you, something like that?
What'd you think?
That I'd fucking quit?
You think I'd quit and go home?
Did you really think I'd quit?
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
Move over. Over right here.
(KNIFE CLICKS)
Any luck?
Luck?
Find the diamonds?
Not yet.
Here. It's your drink.
Where's my ice?
Your ice has melted.
What about my other ice?
You know, the kind you get
at Tiffany's.
(CHAD COUGHS)
HOLLANDER: Chad...
I know. You were just
going to tell me.
You wanted to surprise me.
(SPLUTTERS)
The diamonds?
Fuck you!
We both knew this day
was gonna come, Chad.
One of us had to go.
It was always
gonna be you, Chad.
I wish you could
see these, Sara.
They're beautiful.
Argh!
(SARA SCREAMS)
Ohhh!
- (SHOUTS)
- (SCREAMS)
(SARA GRUNTS)
Tell me. Did you know
the whole time?
I'm not telling you shit.
Were you playing me? Huh?
Were you just playing me?
(KNIFE CLICKS)
Ugh! (GROANS)
- (G ROANS)
- Yeah.
Sara?
You think I can't hear you?
You think I don't know
where you are?
Come on, Hollander, talk.
I know you like to talk.
What? Cat got your tongue?

Alright, Hollander.
Let's play-
Are you watching?
Keep your eye on the diamond.
What do you say?
Should we go for number two?
Hey...
Speak up.
I can't hear you.
Three.
Should I just
let 'em all go?
Urgh!
Don't drop them.
