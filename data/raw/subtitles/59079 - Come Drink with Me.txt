COME DRINK WITH ME
Make way! Make way! What do you want?
Here's a letter for Master Chang.
- A letter? Wait here
Master!
- What's up?
Someone ahead has stopped us.
He has a petition, Sir
Letter: Release our leader or else!
Master wants to talk to you
Clear the way
Out of the sedan chair, please
Speak! Where is our leader?
What will the authorities do to him?
Speak!
He will be executed.
- Stop beating him!
Write an appeal to the Governor
If he releases our master
we will let you go
I'm here to enforce the law.
As for the Governor,
he is this area's supreme commander
He won't be intimidated by bandits.
You may do anything you like
The Governor is your father.
He won't sacrifice his son
to safeguard his position
My dad will uphold the law at any cost
He won't swap hostages with thieves
Free me and surrender.
I'll overlook what you've done
Stop bragging, you'll die soon
No.3, write to his father
Tell him we're holding his son hostage
for an exchange within five days
If he refuses, I'll kill his son
and burn down his quarters
What if he dispatches troops?
With his son at our mercy
we have nothing to fear -
as long as Golden Swallow doesn't come.
- Who is this Golden Swallow?
He almost routed us last time
I'd like to meet him
Boy!
What will you have?
Tiger-bone wine
Tiger-bone wine?
Have you any?
- Sorry, we don't
White wine and two dishes then.
- Yes, sir
Tough trip, wasn't it?
- We've trailed him all the way.
- What's the big idea!
Looking for trouble? That's my order!
What's wrong with you?
What now?
Boy, where's my wine?
Coming!
Thank you, sir.
- What do you do for a living?
I work for the Governor.
- So you're an official
What official business are you on now?
- I want to speak with you
So you know me.
- You are Smiling Tiger Tsu Kan
You're quite observant
You wrote this letter, didn't you?
- Perhaps
But there are many details
better discussed face-to-face
Go ahead
We have news of Master Chang.
- That's why I'm here
Well, then
Our leader is in your prison
Tell the Governor to commute
his death sentence and release him
And we'll return
Master Chang right away
What if the Governor refuses?
- We'll have to kill the hostage
You'll find yourselves
in even deeper trouble
Will you release our leader or not?
He committed crimes
and must face justice
Remember our hostage
is the Governor's own son
He is my own brother
Think it over then
What shall we do?
Damn it, kill him!
Get me a jug of wine
Catch!
You got drunk without wine
Your turn to treat me
Sure, drinks are on me
Catch it!
Let me get you a bench
Watch this
I'll handle the bill.
- I'll chip in
Return my money
Here you are
Golden Swallow. - Golden Swallow is
the name. I toast you
You're a sensible man.
- No more games. Let's talk business
All right
I'm here to free Chang and arrest you
I'll ask the Governor to be lenient.
- Did you hear that?
You think you can capture us?
- So you won't cooperate
First you must meet
our second in command
I will when I'm good and ready to.
- You'll go right now
My hand's caught in the door!
Open up!
Open the door!
What do you want?
Some wine.
- Come back later
I need a drink now.
- Get out!
Stay out of our way
Boy, how much do I owe?
What's going on?
- Never mind, get out!
I can't, it's raining
I'll pay this man's bill
He won't be leaving here today
May I know your name?
- Keep out of my way!
Quite a narrow escape.
- Did you hear me!
You won't get away with this!
Out of my way!
Innkeeper, give me a clean room.
I'm staying
You've paid too much, Sir.
- Buy me two horses with the change
I came here alone but won't
leave alone. Find me a guide
Well, I lost the first round
but the fight is not over
Smiling Tiger,
go back and reconsider
I want an answer in five days
I repeat: Release our leader in five
days or we'll kill the hostage
Show him no mercy!
- Shut up!
That kid thinks he's smart.
- Wait till he comes here
He'll learn the hard way
Eat something
You shouldn't keep your hostage here.
I'll be in big trouble if anything happens
Keep quiet!
- All right!
But I am in charge of this temple
All of you staying here like this...
- It's not like we broke in!
I know, I know
but Abbot Liao Kung isn't here
When will he return?
He went to search for someone
said he'll be back in a few days
Please don't start any trouble
before he returns
If the Governor...
Stop!
It's only a junior monk
Are you all right?
Stop the bleeding, please
No use, he's been hit
by a poisonous needle
Please give me the antidote
Give him the antidote
You're too ruthless!
I've already warned you
to keep your disciples away
Next time it will be your blood
that's spilled
No. 5
A lot can happen in one night
Take two men to the inn and
bring the kid back. - Yes
Who's there?
Me
What do you want?
- I can't sleep. Let's have a drink
You're drunk! - No I'm not.
- Go away!
My roof leaks.
Mind if I spend the night here?
You! K
I'll go!
I saw how much you like to fight
Don't touch me
If you do, I'll die here
Get out then.
- I will, I will
Get out
I was just trying to be friendly
Return my things to me
Coming!
It's empty!
Retreat
This green bamboo staff -
long and slender
With it I travel from North to South
Rain or Shine
I live by begging
I live by begging
A beggar is fed by all
This world is full of sin
Neither fame nor wealth tempts me
Nothing material will ever last
Nothing cheers me like wine
Oh wonderful wine, wonderful wine
Be it sherry or gin
I'm delighted all the same
The world is full of sorrow
There's a good heart -
in my pot belly
I'm proud of my pot belly
Pardon me if I sing badly
All that singing and
no one will even buy you a drink
I won't drink today for a change
Are there any meat buns available?
- You certainly enjoy eating
I want some, too.
- You won't get any
We simply must have meat buns
What's your order, drunkard?
- Meat with bread
Don't pay any attention to him.
Let's have corn bread and pickles
And some white wine.
- Forget the wine
You may have it on credit.
- No, not till the old debt is settled
Such a good boy
Sir
You've helped me a great deal.
I want to thank you personally
Whatever for?
- Is this enough? I think so
If you didn't warn me last night
they'd have killed me
I was drunk then
Shall we have some noodles?
May I ask your name?
They call me Drunken Cat
Yeah, let's have noodles
Have you any money?
Of course
Will you buy me a drink?
- Certainly
I won't take it for nothing.
I'll sing for you in return
Don't pay me if you don't enjoy it
Sit down, please
The mountain bandits are on the rampage
They've kidnapped the Inspector-General
They pillage by day and hide at night
This message is worth some reward
Neither gold nor silver tempts me
But the bandits must be eliminated
The Governor's office is panic-stricken
A lone swallow flies over the hill
A lone swallow flies over the hill
We're famished.
- Be quiet!
Thank this young master.
- Thank you, young master
Young master,
please take a seat over there
You wait, I'll order
Since you already know my problem
I'd like your advice
What are you talking about?
- Sir
This will pay off my debt.
Put the rest on account
You've really met a benefactor today.
- I sure have
There's no news of Master Chang.
I'm worried
You must know
where they've hidden him
You're long winded for a young man
- I'm only asking for advice
I need some myself
A dot and a stroke
A slant and two crosses
The sun and the moon
What do they mean?
A dot and a stroke
A slant and two crosses
The sun and the moon
What do they mean?
Sign: Temple
Thank you
Miss,
be extra careful inside the temple
Why? - Nothing, nothing
What's the use of praying
to a clay Buddha -
when a living god like me
can grant your every wish?
Don't run away
You and I can have
our own private banquet
We don't know each other!
Behave yourself!
Do you know me, Golden Swallow?
Good. You're the ones
I've been looking for
You were lucky last time
I lost the first round.
We'll see if you escape now
Good. You're all here
This is sacred Buddhist ground.
How dare you spill blood here!
I've got a mission to accomplish
Don't be too hard on us
Why don't we share a drink
and have a nice chat
Stay out of it or you'll suffer
the same fate as them
You just want to arrest those bandits.
What about your brother's life?
Who are you?
With such beautiful eyes as yours
I'm surprised you don't recognize me
You're Jade-face Tiger!
Let's have that chat
You're a devil in disguise
But if you're willing to repent
return with me
With me pleading for you, the law
will treat you with lenience
She overrates her charm and thinks
I can be leniently treated
I want to thank you for everything
Don't forget your brother is in my hands
Sooner or later,
you'll be in my hands as well
Never! Being on the verge of death
has left you confused
Are you spoiling for a fight?
Let's have it out
Out of my way!
I'll undress and fight you
Don't let her escape
She can't run too far.
Search the woods and bring her back
That way!
What are you doing out of bed?
You...
What's the matter?
Why did you try to trap me?
You're not calling me Sir?
Perhaps I deserve it
Why should I respect you?
You're a hopeless drunk
I told you so. I told you to observe
more and fight less -
but you insisted on
showing off your martial arts
Learned your lesson now?
You know what's wrong with you?
You get mad too easily
Let me examine your wound
I don't need your help
That poisonous dart
should have made her collapse
We've scoured the woods.
- Useless idiots!
Your whole gang beaten by
a little girl
When word gets out
you'll be laughing stocks
If I get hold of her, I'll...
Shut up!
No.5!
Go after her
and don't return empty-handed
It looks bad
Miss Chang, there's no other way
I must suck the poison out
It's all right now
Drunken Cat, aren't you the lucky one!
Please make yourselves at home.
- Thanks
You're a bunch of cowards!
- Wait a minute!
We only came to see how you were
How can you think so poorly of us!
You'll have to carry her back
What are you up to? Don't talk so much!
- She hasn't recovered yet, sir.
Please let her go
Who asked you? Get out of the way!
Still here?
Take a rest inside
You must be tired of living
Why do you want to see me for?
I have some corpses for you.
- Corpses?
Special delivery
Who ordered you to bring them here?
- How about a drink? - Speak up!
It's a hot day and I pushed them
for miles. - Hell!
Where did you find the bodies?
- In the woods
How did you know to deliver them here?
I knew your No.5.
- What else did you see in the woods?
I saw a girl fighting with No.5
A girl?
What else did you see?
Talk!
I was passing through the woods
when I saw her fighting these men
She really let them have it
and sent those guys to heaven
I was so scared
She did it herself?
She had me deliver the bodies to you.
Said you'd tip me five taels of silver.
I never thought...
Wait
Here's five taels of silver.
What else did she say?
Thanks. She said...
She said for you not to worry
the poison wasn't strong
What else?
- That her name's Swallow
She also spoke of a business deal.
Told me to bring back any message
you have for her
Let's go.
You can remove the corpses yourself
Drunken Cat, take me to her
She said she wouldn't meet me
till tomorrow morning
Where?
- She said she'd come find me
No.3! Keep an eye on him
and clear those beggars out
I still haven't eaten!
- Shut up!
Get him some food and
fetch the monk for the funeral
The girl mentioned a business deal.
What's it all about?
Stick to drinking and mind your
own business. - Sure, sure
Abbot Liao Kung is here, sir
Second Master wants you to greet him
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him
out of your sight. - I understand
Don't move!
It's hot. Can I borrow a fan?
I said don't move!
I won't
Who's this Abbot? Who?
- Nobody you know. Don't ask
Where was No. 5 wounded?
The heart. Doesn't look like
a dagger wound
Open the coffin
and examine the corpses
No, she didn't kill him.
- Who did?
Did the beggar carry a bamboo pole
with a gourd fixed to its top? - Yes
To think he was right under my nose
the whole time!
You know him?
- He's the one I've been looking for
Why would an Abbot look for a beggar?
We had the same kung fu master
Had I known,
I wouldn't have been so rude
He didn't look like a kung fu ace
He's truly a great master
But compared to me
he still has a way to go
What's his name?
- Fan Ta Pei
But because he drinks morning to night
Some call him the drunken hero
He killed all five
So he's one of us and it's all
a misunderstanding? - Misunderstanding?
When our teacher died -
he stole his treasured heirloom
the bamboo pole -
and started a new sect
The elders have ordered me
to kill this treacherous infidel -
and recover the pole
Where is he?
- In the rear hall
Seize him
What happened?
Where's the beggar?
He escaped
He won't get far!
Sir, you should have something to eat
You've been uneasy since you returned
Something's definitely bothering you
You've helped me so much
I won't trouble you further
You can't do it alone
Come here
Lift up that stone
No, the big one
Throw it at my head
Come on, strike me!
Do it again
Fling it higher this time
Are you all right?
My days are numbered
What did you tell Jade-face Tiger?
My classmate Liao Kung is the Abbot
Will you entreat him to save my brother?
Even though we had the same teacher
we are enemies
He wanted to inherit this bamboo pole
so he covertly assassinated our teacher
The next time we meet
only one of us will live
How come he joined Jade-face Tiger?
Our teacher had no idea
how evil he really was
The Abbot and Jade-Face Tiger
are birds of a feather
Why don't we arrest him
and eliminate this scourge?
His kung fu skills are unsurpassed
I doubt if I can beat him
He once did me a good turn
Ten years ago, I was a homeless orphan
He was the one who convinced
our teacher to raise me
Because of this kindness
I've always tried to avoid him
I see
You need not concern with my troubles
I'll manage on my own
Miss Chang!
Wait
There's one way out
Bring the Governor's prisoner back
and save your brother
I can't without permission.
My father would never agree
Fortunately, he's still unaware of
what's going on here
Just escort the prisoner back.
I'll have him arrested again
If I deliver your leader
will you free Master Chang?
Sir, since you're willing to help us
we'll do as you say. - Good!
Where shall we make the exchange?
- At the southern slope
What time?
- Noon tomorrow
It's a deal
This green bamboo staff...
long and slender
With it two travel from north to south
Rain or shine
Liao Kung!
You still recognize me. - We two
were fated to meet again someday
Still a beggar after all these years?
Better an honest beggar
than a devil in monk's clothing
I've worked hard to wear this robe
Dyed red with our teacher's blood
Where's his bamboo pole?
It's a sacred relic.
You'll never touch it
As the eldest disciple
it should be mine
I am obliged to uphold
the honor of our sect
Disciples must obey our ancient code
Anyone who discredits it must
be punished no matter what his rank
Even an abbot?
Teacher swore that the day you saw the
bamboo pole would be the day you die
So you mean to take my life
You must pay for teacher's death
Well, if he so ordered.
what are you waiting for?
I can't forget you once saved me
Aren't you the noble one!
Enough of your idle chatter...
give me the bamboo pole
and I'll let you live
Otherwise, it's a fight to the finish
I saved your life
and I can destroy your life
Grant me three days' grace.
- So you can run away?
I promised to escort
Master Chang home
You're on the verge of death
yet still middle in others affairs
I'm asking for a favor.
Stay out of this affair
Your affairs are of no concern to me
in three days we can settle our score
You can't escape, anyway.
Three days won't matter
You may go
What's the meaning of this?
You have the reputation of
a man of integrity
How can you break your word?
I made a promise,
there was no alternative
Please try to understand
Old beggar, I know what you're up to
We won't say anything this time
But if your paths cross again
you better stay out of our way
I won't forget your benevolence.  I'll
never interfere in your affairs again
Till we meet again.
Let's go
Thank you!
Protect the sedan chair
Are you all right, brother?
- Yes
Tell them if they don't stop
I'll kill you
Hold it!
Take some men and go on ahead.
I'll have a look up there.
- Good!
Let's trap them all
Go up the other side
Be careful, don't hurt the master
We searched east and west,
and can't find them!
Wait here. I'll find them.
- All right
Attack!
Stop the prisoner's wagon
Let's go!
Get after them! Pursue them!
Where's the prisoner's wagon?
- It's headed for the hills
Out of the way!
Abbot, grab her!
- Run away while you can!
Right! Get out of the way!
Don't be so ruthless, young fellow.
Who are you?
Never mind, where's that beggar?
You... you're Abbot Liao Kung?
Sir, please keep out of this
I'll send you to heaven
Sir, take the men out of here
Have you thought about what I said?
- Yes, I have
You are hereby expelled from
the Bamboo sect and exiled.
I promise not to seek revenge
You're the one who will be destroyed
Get out of here!
My life or death is in your hands
Do as you please
Don't try any of your tricks!
I am not beholden to you and I'll
never again feel obligated to you
Let me tell you something.
Go and hide in the remotest hills
Adopt a new name and start a fresh
If I run into you again my sword
will not be so sympathetic
I must leave you now
That's what you think!
Thank you, master.
