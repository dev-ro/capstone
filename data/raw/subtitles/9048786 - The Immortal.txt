'When I was little
and I was in an orphanage,
know what the nuns always said?
An earthquake is
the will of God.
It does the earth good.
Like when someone's not well.
And he lets it build up
until he lets go and erupts.
Or he dies.'
Help!
Ciro! Ciro!
'I sank into hell to understand.
After all we've done to one
other, we're still here.
Just you and me.
- Shoot, I'm over it.
- You can't lie to me.
Killing your kids' mother
is something you can't forget.
Shoot!
I killed my Debora
with these two hands.
I woulda killed anyone
who came between us.
This is Ciro Di Marzio,
the boss of Secondigliano!
None of our fuckin'
business!'
He's alive!
'I spent my whole life
with death close by.
I'm not afraid of dying.'
THE IMMORTAL
So, it's true what they say.
No one can kill the Immortal.
The shot they fired
into your chest
stopped a centimeter
from your heart.
I need to smoke,
got a cigarette?
Where's Gennaro?
Your brother's fine.
While you were in the coma
he retired with his family.
Why are you keeping me locked
in here like a prisoner?
If you're in here it's because
no one must know you're alive.
Otherwise, I don't know
how this story ends.
God wanted you alive,
he gave you another chance.
It'd be a sin if you didn't
make the most of it.
Besides, there's no one
waiting for you out there.
You gotta go away, Ciru.
Far away.
I'm opening
an important channel.
And I need someone like you.
I can give you a new life.
Think about it.
Ciro Di Marzio?
Dimitri.
Welcome.
Yuri Dobeshenko.
I can see the whole city
from here.
This is the tallest skyscraper
in all of Latvia.
The Latvians were part
of the great Soviet Union,
but they wanted independence
and have become
the asshole of Europe.
They didn't understand
that we Russians
are still the masters here
because we command the economy.
Don Aniello spoke
very well of you,
I'm sure we'll do
excellent business together.
The shipment's on its way.
The day after tomorrow
we'll deliver.
Good, Dimitri will
let you know where.
Escort the young man.
Let's go.
Friends.
I lived in Italy for two years.
Your country is beautiful, too.
He's Emils, our boss.
He welcomes you to our home.
It didn't look like
a welcome to me.
The Russian pigs believe
they command in our home.
They believe they can invade
Latvia again
with their filthy money,
but they're wrong.
That's why we need your cocaine.
I'm not interested in your wars.
I'm a broker,
I deliver the drugs
on behalf of a seller
and my seller
has a deal with the Russians.
If you want to be a broker,
first you have
to be alive, Italian.
We know the Russians pay
20 a kilo,
we Latvians pay 21.
Either you do business with us,
or you can die
with the Russians.
But is it worth dying for a war
that's not yours?
We need an answer soon.
- 'Ciru.'
- Don Aniello.
'The shipment's cleared Customs,
it's on its way.
Tomorrow morning I'll send one
of my people to get you.'
I'm on it.
Good morning, Don Ciro.
Don Aniello sent me
to pick you up.
We'll take my van,
so I can show you around.
They're our containers.
I got them outta Customs,
we have a warehouse.
We'll take it all there.
We'll go there now
so you can meet the others.
That's not merchandise,
it's personal stuff.
It goes to the place you got me.
No problem, I'm on it.
All good, we can go.
Guys, we're honored to have
the man Don Aniello sent us.
He's with us now and we're
at his disposal for anything.
Virgilio.
He's my right-hand man.
He handles relations
with the people in Naples.
He's my pride,
I raised him like a son.
We've been expecting you.
Your place is near mine,
for anything, ask me or my wife.
Pasquale, he handles
the contacts
with people at the port.
If you need anything, ask me.
Eligio is our best seller.
Bruno's exaggerating,
I just do my job.
Franco and Salvatore,
logistics and warehouse.
- Nice to meet you, Don Ciro.
- Hello.
This is my crew.
All the counterfeit goods
in this country
come out of this warehouse.
When it comes to knockoffs,
we're the best.
C'mon, guys, back to work!
Now I'll take you
to see the workshop.
Where we turn market rags
into designer clothes.
Come with me.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bruno.
Everything all right?
Come.
Elga, Pasquale's wife.
Annunziata, Eligio's wife,
Dora, Franco's wife.
Vera.
Virgilio's wife, she got
the apartment ready for you.
The apartment? All in order?
- I did what you told me.
- Well done.
I'll get back to work,
excuse me.
If I may.
Let's go.
The furniture's arrived. Come.
This is Vera
and Virgilio's apartment,
Franco and Eligio
live upstairs with their wives.
They're all good people,
easy-going, you saw them.
No one will bother you.
I'm further down.
If you need anything, I'm here.
You're on the ground floor,
the entrance is here,
first door on the right.
The days never end here.
At this time of the year,
they last for 20 hours.
I had shutter blinds
put in for you.
Or else it's hard to sleep.
You can go now,
I need to get some rest.
Good morning.
Let's go, come on.
What are you doing here?
I want to learn the trade,
can I watch?
But don't touch anything.
Hey!
Stop!
Thief! Stop!
Bruno!
Ciru!
- Did you get what I asked for?
- Here.
You're a legend!
Ciru! Lover boy!
Break up these spark plugs.
There's ceramic
in the spark plugs
that we need. Look and learn.
Cool!
Bruno!
Tell us the story of Blackbird.
You never tell it anymore.
- What can I tell you?
- Everything.
He's number one,
no one's ever stopped him.
Tell 'em why
he's called Blackbird.
You wanna know?
You can tell them.
He pilots a speedboat
like he's flying on water.
- Like lightning.
- He flies for real!
Once he had seven police boats
after him.
Seven! It was at night,
the sea was stormy.
- They caught him...
- As if!
He was going so fast
he caught on fire.
Him, his speedboat
and the cops on his tail.
When did you meet him?
A year ago, outside the Red
Bloom. I was with Stella.
He pulled up in an amazing car,
he was with two six-foot babes.
- Six foot!
- They were hot.
How was he dressed?
In this mind-blowing fur coat,
he looked like a lion.
You got it.
Everyone kissed his hands.
And he gave money to everyone.
How do you get to be like that?
Never trust anyone
and never be afraid of anything.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- You're not afraid?
- No.
- Not even of dying?
- He's the Immortal.
It's true, he's the Immortal.
But I don't want to die.
- You don't want to die?
- No.
Then this life's not for you.
Do you want to become like him?
Me?
Even stronger.
Let's go, guys.
Guys, back to work!
See you later.
Two in the back,
one in the front.
Move!
Bruno, here!
What a masterpiece.
Let's hit it!
Go!
Go! Faster!
Good job.
Bye, Nunzio. Bye, Bruno.
See you, guys.
Will you give me a cigarette?
- We did good today.
- You did good, Ciru.
Night, Bruno. Night, Nunzio.
Night, Ciru.
Let's hit the hay.
Night, dude.
Night, everyone.
That was a masterpiece we did!
Night, guys.
- Dad, did you bring it?
- No, I forgot!
No, I told you a hundred times!
Here!
You like it?
- Hi, Bruno.
- Hi.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
The usual?
Vodka, please.
Did something happen?
Is your place okay?
I didn't come here to chat.
I got a problem, I need a hand.
But it's not gonna be easy.
I'd do anything for you.
Dad, when are we going?
Mama!
I can't get my jacket on.
Are were going to the rides too?
Yes, we're going to the rides.
They're here.
Come with Dad.
Let's go.
You made the right choice,
broker.
We're the winning horse.
Follow me.
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.
From this moment
you and I are brothers.
You will have my protection
and my blessing.
Come with me, Annarella.
- It went well, right?
- We totally killed it.
We did a good job.
Yeah, but what happens now?
Now we'll see, he's on his way.
Nothing must happen.
We made a mistake.
We got nothing to do
with trafficking.
Vera's right,
these things are dangerous.
It's true, but maybe things
can change.
If we get into this business,
we'll stop starving to death.
But we're not starving
to death, Bruno.
What we have
isn't enough anymore,
I'm fucking sick
of keeping my head down.
What's gotten into you?
You've never done these things.
You've worked all your life
with rags running scams.
That's what we are.
This is our life.
You think I'm not up to it,
don't you?
I'm scared, Virgilio.
Good evening, Don Ciro.
This is for you.
Holy mother, so much money!
If you want,
you can work with me.
There are advantages, risks too.
You're giving us an exceptional
opportunity, thank you.
Don Aniello never trusted us
this much.
From now on, my word is enough.
But it's not a game, it's
a big deal. Think about it.
The choice is yours.
Are we sure
that we have a choice?
In life there's always a choice.
What's hard is turning back.
Ciro!
Today I felt alive
for the first time in 30 years.
I've never forgotten you, Ciru.
Guys, wake up!
- Hurry up.
- Close it!
Wake up.
- Close the window!
- No, we gotta go.
Ciru.
Wake up, I got
a surprise for you.
Let's go, hurry up.
So you didn't hear me!
Don't you wanna wake up?
Stop being foolish!
Guys, eat whatever you want!
Go!
One hundred, two hundred,
three hundred...
four hundred.
Here's 450.
- How did you split it up?
- Half as usual.
They said 100 for the stereos.
That's what my contact gives us,
take it or leave it.
- He's a shitty contact.
- Have you got another one?
We bust our asses for peanuts.
Guys, your share.
Ciru!
Good boy.
Bruno, go outside,
they want to see you.
Move.
Be good.
- Who was that, Blackbird?
- Yeah.
What did he say?
He'll let me in on the cigarette
smuggling, my time has come.
Bro, now you can buy
everyone a drink.
Drink? Tonight I'll take you
to dinner!
Way to go, bro!
I'm gonna stuff myself.
And what's the problem?
Ciru...
Let's take them to hear
an angel sing?
Stella?
She's good, isn't she?
Brava!
Will you let my friend sing?
Will you let him sing a song?
Bruno! Bruno!
- Sit down...
- It's all right, it's okay.
She's too good.
Are you under her spell, Ciru?
Brava! Brava, Stella!
Brava, you were great.
You were amazing.
- Did you like it?
- A lot.
I sang that song for you.
Another round of applause
for the singer!
You were too good.
I want you to sing
at my wedding.
- But you gotta pay me.
- Bastard!
Let's make a toast,
pass the bottle.
- That was really moving.
- And you're beautiful.
Me too, just a little.
Come on, just a little.
He's a kid.
- What are we toasting to?
- To Stella.
To Stella? To the singer
and to smuggling!
We're gonna make money!
You were amazing, baby.
Ciru, you got nothing to say?
Did you like the song?
Yeah, I think you're gonna be
the best singer in the world!
Of course, she's my Stella!
- Sing again!
- I've fucking had enough!
Let's go! Move it! Come with me!
It's all right,
nothing happened. Keep eating.
Ciro!
You coming to the party tonight?
The kids really want you to.
I dunno.
All right.
The shit's here.
Got any news for me?
Virgilio, has my package
arrived?
Yeah, man, it's all here!
Let's go see.
Let's go.
A guy who escorted the cargo
said the situation's not good
in Naples.
The cops have seized
another shipment,
now they're all fighting
each other.
They all say that Don Gennaro
Savastano was right to get out.
But he's fine,
he bought himself
a nice villa in Posillipo.
He's got a new life.
You two were friends,
weren't you?
We were brothers.
But I'd never have shot
a brother.
I asked him to.
You? Why?
Because he had
a good reason to live.
After everything you did,
you ended up in this shithole.
Why are you here, Virgilio?
The truth?
I don't have the balls
to change things.
If I did, maybe my wife
would love me again.
- Your wife loves you.
- Yeah, like a dimwit brother.
You think that
and do nothing to change it?
If I was like you, then yes,
but you can't buy courage.
But I don't have any courage.
I'm not afraid only 'cause
I got nothing left to lose.
When I had to defend my family
I wasn't up to it.
I lost everyone.
But now you have a family.
Look after your family
better than I did.
The new shipment has arrived.
We'll deliver it tomorrow.
How long have we been
doing good business together,
my dear Ciro?
- A year.
- A year...
A lot of things
have changed, haven't they?
I was right,
we won our war.
There's a strange light
in this city.
A lot of people say
this light drives them crazy.
Partners for a year
and no problems
calls for a celebration.
Until morning.
I already have plans tonight.
You always have plans.
Like a guy with a family
who has to go home at night.
You know as well as me,
people like us
can't afford to have families.
Happy birthday, Tommaso!
Ciru!
Gimme a cigarette.
Everyone likes you.
They look up to you as a boss.
I see you together with them,
they've become your posse.
What are you talking about?
It's true.
I'm getting old.
Ciru...
I need to tell you something.
I've decided the time has come
for me to go back to Naples.
I want to go home.
- When?
- Next week.
So soon?
I've already organized
everything,
it's all set.
I thought of leaving Virgilio
in charge of the posse,
if you don't have
a problem with that.
No problem.
What's good for you
is good for me.
Thank you, Ciru.
Good night, Bruno.
Last night
we had a really good time.
- We all had fun.
- Thank you.
The green dress looked
great on you.
No one could keep
their eyes off you.
If you say so...
- Ciro was looking at you, too.
- Yeah, he was.
What the fuck
are you talking about?
Why are you getting mad?
What's gotten into her?
You don't understand anything.
- You don't see what I see.
- What do you see?
I see a lonely man,
with no desires anymore.
I brought your clean stuff.
If I'm disturbing you
I'll come later.
Come in.
I changed your sheets.
I'm done.
I didn't want you.
I didn't want you in my house.
I was scared of you.
Then after a while, I realized,
I judged you wrong.
Then things changed.
What changed?
Now I'm glad you're here.
Ciru, what are you doing
to your hair?
You going to your lover?
Ciro, where are you going?
It's true, where you going?
C'mon, just tell me.
I get it, I think he's in love.
True, he might be.
What's that look for?
Get outta here, go on...
Leave him alone!
Ciro! Where you going
with that sharp hairdo?
He's in love!
Look how spiffy he is!
He even did his hair!
Where you going,
to see your girlfriend?
Thanks for the gelato, Ciru.
You're welcome.
This gelato's good, huh?
I got you a present.
They're beautiful.
You deserve
the finest things in life.
Why?
Because you're an angel.
I'm not an angel.
Why do you say that?
Because angels are in heaven.
The nuns at the orphanage
said that Mama was an angel
and that she was in heaven.
Do you remember your mama?
How could I?
She left me
when I was two months old.
Why?
Because she didn't want me.
But I always want you
with me, Stella.
Let's go, I gotta get to work.
What the fuck's that?
Who the fuck are they?
What the fuck's going on?
What do you want? You know
who this stuff belongs to?
You know whose cocaine this is?
You know whose cocaine this is?
Get off me, Bruno!
Get off me!
Who the fuck are you?
Whaddaya want?
Piece of shit!
I'm sorry, Ciro.
But you have to come with me.
Take the kids inside.
I said go!
I lost four of my men
and 150 kilos of cocaine
and I want it back.
Only you knew.
You knew when the shipment
was arriving.
Some of you like talking.
Virgilio...
Ciru...
It wasn't us.
I swear, we didn't betray you.
I know.
See?
I wasn't scared.
I did good, right?
You did good.
Now let's go home.
You're responsible
until the delivery,
so it's your problem.
I'm responsible,
leave them alone.
They're my insurance
that you'll solve the problem.
I'll give you 24 hours,
before I kill them all.
- It's not their fault.
- Shut up!
Don't take it badly,
it's just business.
I can't do it by myself,
I need someone.
Just one.
Bruno, get up.
Let's go.
Let's split up!
We're screwed, Ciro.
We're screwed!
They're up our ass.
Ciro! What the fuck
are you doing?
Ciro!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Ciru...
If you ask me,
this is a fucking dumb idea.
You got balls coming here.
What do you want?
I could kill you now.
The Russians know it was you.
They're on their way.
You've got a chance
to save yourself.
It's me.
You wanna be master
in your own home again?
We gotta kill them all.
Why should I trust you?
Because now your war
is mine too.
Ciru!
What the fuck happened?
You're all wet.
- What happened?
- You got no idea!
- The cops were after us.
- Cops?
- And?
- There was no way out.
Bruno shouted: "We're screwed!"
I jumped overboard.
The water was freezing.
I felt like a penguin!
I believe it.
Dry yourself.
The police boat stopped
and Bruno got away.
And where's Bruno now?
He'll be back any minute. Don't
worry, I'll stay here with you.
You'll stay here with me?
- Whatever happens to me?
- I'll always be here.
Come here, let me dress you.
And if business goes well,
I'll give you heaps of presents.
What kind of presents?
Necklaces, watches, motorbikes,
cars, whatever you like.
And then?
Me, you and Bruno will buy
a big house in Posillipo.
- With a pool?
- Of course.
So you can take
another dip, huh?
In the pool!
Bruno!
Baby, what we did!
You were incredible, Ciru.
Get my shoes, hurry.
- How did you think of it?
- Just came to me.
You saved me, Ciru.
Fix him up good,
tonight he's in for a treat.
- What's going on?
- We performed a miracle.
Blackbird called us to the club.
Really?
- To the Red Bloom?
- Exactly.
We're gonna make heaps of money.
God willing!
We will, I swear.
Sure, where else
will he find a pair like us?
You can say that again.
Let's go!
You'll live like a queen.
- Don't be late.
- Don't wait up for us.
- Bruno! Wait here a minute.
- I'll be right here.
Good evening.
Who's he?
He's my son.
Are you the one who jumped
overboard to stop the cops?
- Good boy! What's your name?
- Ciro.
Good job,
Ciro come here to Uncle.
Go get yourself an ice cream.
Here. The kid's got balls.
How the fuck did
such a smart kid
grow up with such
a dickhead father?
You do know that
I pay for the speedboat fuel?
You cost me three times as much
as the others.
Why the fuck do you have
to go so fast?
It's the third time
you risked losing the load.
Who the fuck
do you think you are?
You do as I say or I'll kick
your ass outta here!
He wants to call the shots.
Do things his way.
This kid deserves better.
And your girlfriend,
what's her name?
Stella, am I right?
Go back to Stella and change
your shirt, it's fuckin' ugly.
I'm a good-for-nothing.
I'm hopeless,
I shoulda spit in his face.
He treated me like an asshole
in front of everybody.
I'm hopeless.
It's not true, you're the best.
I wish I'd had
a father like you.
Here.
You ready?
Let's go.
- In Saint Anna we trust!
- Saint Anna!
May the Holy Virgin be with us!
- Where are you going?
- The right way.
What does that mean?
It means the time's come
to branch out on our own.
Come, Bruno!
Okay, perfect.
Guys, come on!
Go, go!
Go!
Come on, go!
Quick!
Go, go!
Take two.
- You gotta sell them tonight.
- Piece of cake.
Ciru, come!
But if Blackbird finds out,
he'll be pissed.
I don't give a fuck
about Blackbird
we work and he gets the money.
The time's come to stick it
up his ass!
Ciro, move it!
Are you asleep or what?
Where are our husbands?
What happened?
No one's answering.
Go out and take the kids.
Mama...
Where's Virgilio?
Where is he?
Where's Virgilio?
I'm sorry.
I need your help.
I need you.
You have to do something for me.
- Only you can help me.
- I looked for you all over.
I was afraid something bad
had happened to you.
Blackbird is pissed at you.
I know, that's why I called you.
We fucked up.
Big time.
But we want to make up for it.
And only you can help us.
Me? How?
Go to Blackbird, bring him here.
He trusts you.
- Tell him we're sorry.
- We want to apologize.
We made a mistake,
but we won't do it again.
- Are you sure he'll understand?
- He'll understand.
Of course he'll understand.
By tonight,
it will all be cleared up
and we'll go listen
to Stella sing.
- Right, Nunzio?
- Sure.
Trust me.
Go.
Go.
You know, Bruno...
I respect these people.
They do what they do
for their country,
for their families.
I respect them, even though
I don't believe in all this.
I learned that when I was a kid.
People like us
are condemned to be alone.
Let's go.
You ready?
Are you ready?
Let's go.
Bruno!
Nunzio!
Where are you taking us?
I know it was you.
Stella!
I froze on the streets
for 30 years, for no reason.
I deserved to go out on a high.
You didn't even stop when
they got your people involved.
- You killed Virgilio.
- I didn't want Virgilio to die.
I wanted you to die!
You took my life.
You became what I never was.
Since you got here,
all I've thought of
is how I can fuck you over.
But I'm not
that little kid anymore.
You'll never fuck me over again.
Get out!
How old would Stella be now?
Do you remember
the voice she had?
I've never forgotten it.
What is it, are you scared?
What? You taught me.
In life you should never be
scared of anything
not even dying.
But you don't know
what that means.
I do.
Because I'm already dead.
Kill me.
Kill me now.
Death is a gift
you don't deserve.
For you there'll never be peace
or forgiveness on this earth.
Now go.
I said go.
Why?
Never leave your enemies alive.
That's what I think, too.
No boss.
Hey, kid!
Are you Ciro?
- Yeah, I'm Ciro.
- Pleasure, Attilio.
Now I'll take you to meet
Don Pietro Savastano,
the first thing is manners,
got that?
- Got it.
- Good, let's go.
Ciro, this is for you.
It's personal.
