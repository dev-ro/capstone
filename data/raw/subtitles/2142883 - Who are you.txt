Is the Bravo Team ready?
Bravo Team?
Room service.
- What gives?
- Room service.
Camera?
Security camera.
Come here, you!
Reyhan said that Çetin hasn't
been home for three days.
She said if that's what he's going to do,
then he can go and stay at his sister's.
- You bonehead.
- Çetin!
- Tekin!
- Hopefuly he'll run out of steam in a bit!
The counterfeit money operation pursued for
2.5 years by the Istanbul Police Department...
...became a disaster overnight.
A fire broke out in the hotel that was raided,
leaving the operation up in the air.
Tekin Yüksek, whose being held responsible
forthe collapse of the operation...
...is currently in custody. The hotel's
head of security is with us now.
I'd like to ask him, "Was the
cause of the fire neglect?"
Absolutely not! The fire broke out
as a resuIt of a commotion caused...
...by an irresponsibIe person.
By the way, our hotel has air-conditioning.
In otherwords, a fire in the hotel
isn't possible.
Thank you.
Tekin Yüksek, the suspect who says he's
a detective, is being removed from the hotel...
...and is being taken to Istanbul
Police Headquarters for questioning.
I'm a detective, mate.
Why wouldn't you let people know beforehand
that you were conducting a secret operation!
According to the information we've just received,
the suspect who has been taken into custody...
...works at Pops Detectives.
- Tops, not Pops!
- ...works at Pops Dedectives.
- Tops!
He's just been placed in the police car and is now
being taken to the police station forquestioning.
You're watching aren't you?
Adnan, I think we've found ourman.
He says he's a detective, yet he
put the hotel on fire!
- Look, it's Tops, not Pops!
- Give it a rest!
Look here Tekin from Tops Detectives!
If you give the shoddy photos that you shot...
... to my wife, I swear..
...I'll finish you and your successful career!
You got that!
Go easy, Mahmut! Are you wearing a ring?
You're going to bruise my face!
Help me up! Help me up!
Please bro, it makes it hard if we don't
hang you upside down like this.
No! Everything has to seem real.
Whatever happens when a person
gets bashed has to happen.
The idea is to appear on TV and
clear the company's name.
TV has a really powerful impact
with these sorts of things.
- Is the cameraman coming?
- Yeah.
But he'll be here around
four-five in the afternoon.
Ok. So you're chasing me in such a way
that the cameraman can see.
Then what do I do?
I run into a side street.
Then we just bash him as we wish.
Of course. Everyone takes a hit.
- You wrote the address down, yeah?
- Yeah.
Just a little further down
from Salih Mehmet Road.
- Why are you going so farman? Why not just
give him a good beating in the neighbourhood?
Mahmut, I hope you're not going to
include him in the operation?
- No.
- Kenan, what's with your clothes man?
- Don't worry bro. I've got it under control.
- That's exactly what I'm afraid of.
Yes?
Wounded Eagle has returned to the nest.
- Has the wheat spiked?
- Yes.
And the fields?
They're green.
- And the clouds?
- They've cleared. Open the door. It's me, Tekin!
Ismail?
Yes?
The door!
- Good luck with that.
- Thanks mate.
- Please, this is a serious firm, man.
- And what do you think I'm doing here, Tekin?
That's exactly what I'm asking.
What are you doing?
Oh this? This is a driving course thingamajig.
They really liked my driving Iesson.
And now I'm going to attend
first aid classes.
- What happened to your cheek?
- While you've been here doing nothing...
... I was clearing the company's name.
Mahmut the brute punched me while we were rehearsing.
I'll get you a hardboiled egg
to rub on the bruise.
Thanks but no thanks.
Tekin my boy, I took first aid lessons
for 25 years as a traffic cop.
I was the first person to come to mind
when first aid was mentioned.
- But you still pIay rummikub in the office.
- I win, don't l?
Ismail, the company's name's been shattered
and Iook at what you're worried about.
Pops Detectives. What a smart name.
How quick you are to forget yourpenis problems!
Let's discuss this afterwards in the board meeting.
Look, I've told you a hundred times
not to touch this house, that it's not dry yet.
What's my father's gun doing here?
- The signwriter brought it.
The signwriter? What!
Wasn't he supposed to do this in blue?
Selim dear. Don't slam the door.
- Here's yourtea, Tekin.
- Looks like piss, man!
Bro, can we close ouraccount now?
- We're not running away, are we?
- Look, dad has strict orders.
He said to go tell Pops that they haven't paid rent for
the last 3 months, so they may as well pay for tea.
It's Tops, not Pops! Give it a rest and
get me some reaI tea.
- Give me a hundred bucks first.
- I don't have any change!
No worries man, I'll change it for you.
And look, I'm sick of being caught between you.
I come to you and you say no.
I go to him and he says go and get it. And I can't
answer back because he's rellgious and all.
- Please, tell me what to do.
- You know what you should do?
- What, bro?
- Just f...ck off man!
There's no need forthat Tekin, man.
- Tekin, come here son and give me a hand.
- Jeez, hold on a minute!
Tekin man, please just give me the money.
Look, I've still got a game to get to.
- Close the doorquietly.
Pardon me.
Is this Tops Detectives?
- Pops madam, Pops.
- Shut up Ismail, please!
Furthermore, I'd really appreciate you
putting away this dummy, Ismail.
- I can come back anothertime if you wish.
- No, of course not.
We as Tops Detectives always keep our
door open forclients. Won't you take a seat?
- Tekin, man.
- What?
- The money for the tea?
- Oh the tea, of course.
Withraw it from this card.
- Do you know the pin?
- No, man.
You place yourfinger on the machine
like this and it gives you the money.
- But Tekin.
- Son, I'm in a meeting now. Later.
- Ismail, show Selim the door.
- Like the door, Selim?
Careful, don't hit your head.
Take a seat.
Yes, madam. How will I be
of service to you?
- Only, can we talk in private?
- Would you like me to leave?
- I'd like to speak with you?
- Ismail.
- Tekin.
- Ismail.
- Tekin.
- Ismail.
Tekin.
- Weren't you leaving Ismail?
- What forson? We have work to do.
- Yes. Yourname?
- Suzan.
Yes, Sezen. How long have we suspected
that your husband has been unfaithful to us?
- It's Suzan.
- Who's Suzan?
- I'm Suzan.
- Are you Suzan?
Yes.
Do you think yourhusband is being
unfaithful to you with you?
Don't. This will harm the marriage.
You mis understood. You said Sezen just before, that's
why. My name is Suzan.
- Who is Sezen?
- How should I know? My name is Suzan.
Then pleased to meet you madam.
- We were talking about yourhusband.
- I don't have a husband. I'm here for my daughter.
- Has she hit the night spot?
- Hold on a minute Ismail,jeez.
If that's the case, then I say we shouldn't bother.
It's shifty business, it is.
What night spot, man? Maybe she's
just out to make some money.
Can't she actually just be singing?
Does she have a good voice?
Look Tekin, if the night spot's involved, then
there's something not right about the girl either.
If it was simply for money, she could become a cleaner.
Why entertain men at tables?
Maybe she isn't entertaining men at theirtables!
Madam, was yourdaughter
wearing racy costumes lately?
Not everyone who ends up in night spot
entertains men! It depends on the club.
Isn't that right? There are strip clubs, revues...
Have I mis understood?
They use mouth balls, whips,
Apple Touch. Those sorts of things.
Mouth ball?
Have you lost your mind?
Was she kidnapped? It's
the organ mafia madam.
They kidnap these innocent girls,take their kidneys
and then sell them back to the night spot.
You're obsessed with the night spot!
How can a girl with just one kidney sing!
- Tekin!
- What?
She wasn't kidnapped and she hasn't hit the slums.
She's just going through a rough time at the moment.
- Why?
- We lost herfather.
- Then let's find him too.
- He's dead.
- My condolences.
- Oh.
At least you know where he is.
Isn't that so?
So how long has he been
dead since he passed away?
- About a month.
- It's still very new.
Have you held a wake yet?
She may come forthe ceremony.
Jeez, how can a dead man go to
a wake? Be a little thoughtful, please!
I'm very sorry Suzan.
Look, it's a really difficult situation for a
girl at this age to lose herfather.
What's more, Pelin's a sensitive girl.
Exactly like Ismail here. He's like that too.
You touch him and he's all in tears.
I'm a retired traffic cop madam.
Sorry to hearthat but Pelin's
situation is no joking matter.
She's been on herfeet forthe last month with
medication and they've made her really aggressive.
She won't see herfriends, or me,
and she won't come home either.
Believe it or not, but I'm curious too now.
Where is this girl?
I am asking you forheIp. I'm really afraid
that something terrible will happen to her.
Well I'd be scared if it were me too.
There are thieves, mollesters
and rapists out there...
Anything could have happened. Maybe, while
we've been sitting here, getting to know each other...
...chatting, they took the girl and
locked her up in a studio...
...in a really expensive studio,
and they've oiled herup so she looks good.
They've made her look like
the covergirls on magazines.
They're taking erotic pictures of her.
Can you see it?
Now I'm going to get up tomorrow morning
and turn the computer on with all my morning glory...
...enterthe erotic site that I'm a member of,
and there's yourdaughter!
- So how are we going to find this girl?
- I have a number.
Then call.
I have but I can't through.
The numberbeIongs to a hotel.
If you look for her, you might
be abIe to find her. If you do find her.
...please don't leave her alone.
Stay with her, ok?
Oh, she may leave the hotel
today at 12:00.
- Of course, 12:00 check out time.
- Couch bed? The girI's definitly hit the slums.
Not couch bed, check out! You know, those
hotels with single use toothbrushes, those.
So Suzan, do you have a clothed
picture of your daughter with you?
Yes. Here.
That's her! Ok. I'll find this girl.
Yeah, he'll definitely get her out of the slums.
Beautiful girl. She must be found.
AygüI, Tekin and Ismail are the
detectives who will find Pelin.
- You're number?
- There's no need, Aygül.
Don't forget, 12:00. I trust you.
- Suzan.
- Yes?
You can trust me.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
The girI's definitely in a night spot.
She ran away from home.
Whatever. I'm going to a driving class.
I'm Iate aIready.
Ismail, we'll firstly renew my father's grave.
Then we'll have a huge sign made for us.
- Tops Detectives with a big T.
- Did you get a down payment from the woman?
Enough, Cemil. Man, how much longer
do we have to push the cart forfive bucks?
- Just until the top of the hill, bro.
- You said the same thing just a minute ago man.
Ok,just hand overthe money.
I swear it's just a loan.
What loan man! You already have two
servings from Iast week.
And now the one Ismail ate, that makes three.
I'm just earning pocket money man.
You have a point too. You have a point.
What have you done!
- Hello.
- What's the situation?
Adnan has moved into action.
Very well. Get the minibus ready.
So what did I just say?
- Don't piss me off.
- Wrong. You are not to piss me off!
- You should not piss me off.
- Bravo.
He uses too much saIt, it's unhealthy.
So are we going to dally around like this?
Tempo!
Dial 1 then dial 5.
Shit, let's just go there man.
- Where are we going Tekin?
- To the hotel. Give me the keys. I'll drive.
- What keys?
- The car keys.
- I can't Tekin, I have a cIass.
- You call that an excuse?
He who pays the piper calls the tune, Tekin.
Hello, the late Nuri Yüksek.
You always use my father's phrases whenever
you're lost forwords. No one takes me seriousIy.
No one takes anyone seriously fornothing.
You have to earn it.
So I haven't earned it?
For God's sake, you soId yourfather's prized gun
just to have a sign made you idiot!
Just as collateral.
Additionally, that sign is ourface.
- F...ck yourface!
- You're stealing my dad's words again man.
This may be a turning point for us.
You won't be going back with this
car, Tekin. I'm going to cIass.
- Please man.
- No.
- I need it.
- You're not getting it.
- I will!
- Overmy dead body!
Lady, come, come!
Caps forthe titties.
Look! Lady!
Jenniferwears one of these too.
She was on TV recently.
She looked great!
Come lady, come!
Fresh, dally, five bucks for a kilo.
- Detective!
- Pleased to meet you too, dear.
- Only I'm a little offended.
- Why?
- Why won't you accept me? I've been
sitting forthe police exam fortwo years.
Look dear. I'm really busy right now.
Let's talk Iater.
But the police force needs me,
and that's a reallty.
Yes, dear.
I forone know what the
weight of a uniform means.
- Yes.
- My fatherwas a cop.
- In otherwords, you have to accept me.
- You know what you should do my dear?
- What?
Go outside now and wait for a bit.
Ok dear?
- Yes, I'll wait but.
Ok, now go outside and wait.
Go on then.
- I'll be waiting ok.
- Ok, ok. Go outside and wait.
- Wait out there.
- Detective?
- Yes?

I could fit the whole family here.

- No sir.
Look, can we put an end to
the 'sir' business.
Thank you, Sinem.
Yes sir.
How can I help you?
Dear, I'd like to see the last 15 days' guest

But firstly I'd like a desk for myseIf.

You misunderstood me.
I don't understand why you'd want one.
Why? I'm Ejder Bilir from the police department.
Ejder Bilir from the police department.
I want the last 15 days' guest list immediately.
- Sir, can I pIease see some identification?
- Are you asking me foridentification?
Who are you to be asking me for ID?
Who are you to be asking me for ID?
Are you asking me for identification?
Who the hell are you to be asking me for ID?
I don't care if the f...cking president.
- You've got me wrong. I understand perfectIy well.

Yes. Ok dear.
Thanks boys.
CongratuIations, thank you. The suspect has
been found. Thank you very much.
Kiss Sinem forme. If you don't,
I'll kiss her. Go on then.
- Detective?
- What?
- Didn't I say that the police force needs me?
- You did.
- I caught a thief.
- Good on you!
- So?
- Call the police, how the hell shouId I know?
- It wouIdn't be right to call the
police whlle you're here.
- Ok. Show me, where?
- There's a jewelry shop on this corner.
Can't you do a bloody thing without me!
Careful.
Well, you're a cop.
The doordoesn't work.
Tell them the door doesn't work.
So what the hell did you steal at the
crack of dawn, man? What?
Is he the thief?
Sorry. Are you the thief, man?
BIoody. What did you steal? Tell me.
Don't be afraid. Tell me.
- I stole these bangIes.
- Oh, bangIes. Good.
- Then a ring.
- Look, the ring matches the bangle.
You know it's a set?
That's how it works in the market.
It's not worth a thing if you don't have a set.
Good on you fortaking a set. What else?
- Then I didn't take these.
- You didn't take them. Why not?
You forgot because you were in a rush.
The new generation is aIways in a rush.
Come on. Take this as well.
Wow, you're such a man.
You came forthis and you leave without it.
What else did you take? Then?
Then we have something llke this.
Great. That's nice too.
I personally like these.
These are made in Diyarbakýr.
They're given to the bride at weddings.
It also has a necklace.
So you pocketed that too?
- I took this Diyarbakýr.
- You pocketed it.
- I walked out.
- Of course, you needed some air.
The kid went out forsome air.
That's normal. Then what did you do, son?
- There's a motorbike here.
- It's nice man.
Look, I'll break your head if you ride without
a helmet. So there's the bike. What next?
- I got on the bike.
- Ok, so you got on the bike.
Well, It's extremely important for us to see
how things develop.
With these types of cases.
Then what did you do, dear?
- Then I started the bike.
- You started it.
See how he steps on the juice.
What did you do after?
Then I rode off.
I swearhe went. Obviously the kid's
in need. What can you do?
The bike! My bike! My bike!
There you go. He'll catch him.
The case is solved.
- Detective, he's gotten away.
- But he didn't escape from you, did he?
Why did I do this? I did it to test
the hoteI's security.
Everything's a part of the plan.
Mecit! Müfit! Back to headquarters.
- So what happens now detective?
- You'll receive a piece of paperfrom the station.
- What paper?
- Toilet paper.
Dickhead. He says 'what paper.''
- Hello, is the chairfree?
- Yes.
Great!
- Why are you leaving?
- Because you sat down.
- But you said it was free.
- You caught me offguard.
It's a word thing.
You're as smart as you look.
- Don't belleve everything you see.
OnIy there's something I
have to tell you Pelin.
How do you know my name?
I said how do you know my name?
Ok. Let's have a drink together
and I'll explain everything, ok?
Waiter! Dear! Son! Hey You!
Someone hearme, please!
- Yes?
- Two teas, one with sugar.
Then sugarforthe otherone as well.
Two teas. Run along then.
Cancel one of the teas.
Where'd she go?
Look, look!
What look, look? You're always ill-timed.
Go on. Smile, smile, smile.
Move along. Where'd she go?
Pelin? Buddy!
- Follow that black van.
- Piss off!
Jeez! What's his problem!
Sorry for disturbing you.
I was going to ask you what the traffic 's like..
...towards Sarýyer.
Sarýyer, that's right.
Along the shore.
Yeah, I know it's peak hourtoo.
I was going to ask which road I should take.
Hold on a minute. HoId on just a second.
Hey mate!
Mate! Mate!
Maybe I have something important inside!
Well I'm going to Sarýyer,
can you give me a ride too?
Hey mate!
Tekin, that's so not on, son!
I'm a detective. I focus on nothing
else when I'm on duty.
Come off it! I could have become a private detective
with Ismail's retirement pay as well.
Ratherthan make wise cracks
Hamdi, let's get Ismail out.
Hold his head. Careful.
Tekin, it's rude. Why would you
put Ismail in the boot?
You said that already.
There's no such thing as a private detective in this
country. It's like selling antifreeze in Kenya.
- You're playing with Ismail's life.
- That's a bit heavy.
It's not something
that can be taken lightly, Tekin.
You lost yourfather, don't go
and lose Ismail as well.
You have no one. Lonellness is pretty risky.
Look, it's mostly the lonely
who get Iost in this world.
Hamdi, you've done my head in!
You haven't let me sleep. Nightmare afterthe other...
- Ismail?
- Are you ok, Ismail?
- I'm ok, Hamdi. How are you?
- Ismail?
Hamdi, tell that person next to you
that I'm not talking to him.
- I missed my class because of him.
- But Ismail?
Hamdi, tell the same person
that I'm nothing to him.
- But Ismail, duty.
- Hamdi, tell him!
He can hear you, what do you
want me to say man!
Hamdi repeat; if a person doesn't
exist for me, he no longerexists.
Even if the Two Seas came together.
Let's do this; you drive the car
as the key person of the operation.
I'm saying Two Seas, Tekin.
This is no time for a hollday! I'm telling you
that we're running late forthe operation.
But you aIways do the same thing, Tekin.
I deserve to go to the seaside as well.
- Money, Tekin?
- Ok.
-70 bucks.
- That would be good.
Ismail, 70. But I'll pay
you back next month ok.
Tekin, son, I'm talking about the fine!
- Whatever, I accept Hamdi.
- As Iong as I can stick my feet in water.
- Tekin, the fine!
- Do you have change?
- No, I swear.
- Then hopefully next month.
- How Iong can you I've on credit Tekin?
Until the cows come home.
- Why'd you lock me up in the boot?
- I've fallen in love.
If someone was to drive into the back of us,
how were we going to pay forthe bumper?
I have a plan. I say why don't I go and
speak to the girI's motheropenly?
We're going to class Tekin. I've missed
the class. We may as well just return the car.
I'm telling you she's the most beautiful
creature in the world, that she's been kidnapped.
.and you keep going on about
your class, the car.
- That girl probably ended up in the slums.
- I'm begging you.
- You, please!
- We have to go to the lady's house.
- We drop off the car first.
- Duty first!
- Ca rfirst!
- Duty!
- Car first!
- Duty first!
- Car first!
- Don't forget. It's duty first!
- Car first!
- Two breaks in a car, ridiculous man!
- I said car first!
- Duty first!
- Tekin, car first!
- Duty first!
- Car.
- Don't step on the breaks! Duty first!
- Car first!
- Duty first!
- Let's return the car!
- Get your foot off the break.
Rememberourphlloshophy!
Tops Detectives; "Hot air rises"!
Excellent slogan.
Do you want one from me as well?
- Go on.
- The person that you trust the most in life f.cks.
- Car first!
- Duty!
- Car!
- Duty!
- Car first, Tekin!
- Duty!
- Car! Car!
- Ok, the car. Let's return the car then.
We've been walking for 35 minutes because
you, Ismail, put a spanneron.
...the operation of our lives,
and we're still not there yet.
Tekin, you had the cartowed,
that's why we're waIking.
Look, don't mention names in these recordings.
It's a secret operation.
It's so secret operation that we haven't
been able to find the house yet.
Ok. Let's ask.
- Excuse me?
- Not at all.
Dear guests! While our children are having fun
here why don't we all.
.go upstairs and listen to Suzan.
- Why'd we stop, Tekin?
- It says welcome.
So?
It means that we're expected.
It could be a trap.
- Abooby trap?
- Not llke that.
- They could be listening to us.
- Good idea. Let's take a break.
- What are we going to do with you, Ismail?
- I'm wondering too. What are we going to do?
Thank you. Thank you.
I'd like to offermy deep gratitude to you
for coming to this reception.
...on be half of homeless children.
It truly makes me happy to see that
the charity that we founded in the garden...
...here with eight women has
grown like a snowball day by day,
...and transformed into a foundation.
Once upon a time, a beautiful girl
named Snow White lived in a palace.
Hermotherhad died and she had
to llve with her evil stepmother.
This stepmother, the queen, was vain.
Ismail, the coast is clear. Let's go.
I worked as a traffic cop for25 years
Tekin, and look at the state of me!
It's not my fault! They don't have
any othercostumes, do they?
Don't you think I'd like to be Superman?
Now Iet's go over our plan.
You'll be the evil queen, and
I'll be the mirrorthat tells the truth.
You ask me 'is there anyone fairerthan me'...
... and I say 'of course not, Your Majesty'.
What are you saying, Ismail?
Tekin man, they always said it
but I never believed it.
A person really does get nervous
before going on stage.
Jeez! He's worried about the stage!
Thanks to us, homeless chlldren now
have many peopIe who care forthem.
We have become their mothers, sisters,
and teachers. Ourchlldren.
The detectives are here. They've
only been abIe to kidnap the girl.
Yes, thank you all very much.
Have fun.
- Where are they?
- I think they went towards the garden.
Your Majesty! What's wrong?
Speak. Have you swallowed yourtongue?
Mirror! What are we doing here, Mirror?
But we were aIways here Your Majesty!
Your Majesty! Evil Majesty,
You had a question.
The one that we rehearsed.
Your Majesty, get to the question.
.and stop loitering!
- What are you saying, Ismail?
- Ismail's not here! I'm the Mirror!
You're aIways the same! I can't start
the operation because of you.
Our little guest wants to
meet you Suzan.
- Is that so? Come here sweetness.
Yes, take a photo. Thank you.
You made me wearthis outfit.
You fired me up, and now I'm to blame?
- I'm to blame?
- Of course you are. What a stupid plan!
- Don't knock my pIan.
- Piss off!
Yesterday's kid! How the hell are we
supposed to make a plan with yesterday's shit!
Hey, watch yourwords
in front of the kids!
What, what man? I tell the truth
Your Majesty. I'm the Mirror I am.
- Give it a rest!
- Just begin man!
- Look bro, I've got a really bad side.
- Is that right? We know who you are.
That's enough!
Tekin! Son!
Bro!
Tekin!
Yes, Suzan!
Who could have kidnapped your daughter?
We're checking out all the night spots, madam.
- Night spots? Adnan!
Hold me Adnan, I'm going to faint.
Suzan, you're going to faint.
You're going to fall.
See what you've done?
Suzan has fainted.
Not good. Suzan!
Move mate.
We're going to see Suzan.
- I know first aid. Let me through.
- So how did it happen Suzan?
- She's still unconscious. I'll let you
know when she comes around.
- Yes, but we have to question her.
- I know first aid.
Suzan is not in a position to speak now.
You'll have to wait.
Don't let anyone in.
Ismail, let's go and find
the girI's room.
This way Ismail.
- Where are they?
- They're going to come when we call.
- The car?
- We even have a photo.
- Spien did.
- Now create a fake Erdal.
- Erdal?
We need an these idiots to send
aftera fake Erdal.
And get them to be suspicious
of Erdal when they walk in.
- I see. Excellent!
But don't catch them immediately.
Let them follow him for a while.
- Why?
Let them think they've been kidnapped
because they're following Erdal.
And ourplan will continue from where it left off.
- Let's split, Ismail.
- That's right. We don't get along.
- Adnan, these men have made me really tense.
Don't stress yourself out darling,
you'll age quickly.
Don't be insoIent.
When did I faint?
Fifteen minutes ago.
Come on, call these idiots and Iet's send
them after Erdal. Adnan!
Ok. We're going to get them to suspect Erdal.
- I don't want any mistakes this time.
- Don't you worry.
- Pelin!
- Yes, detective.
You escaped.
I escaped to see you.
I would have rescued you if you had waited.
No one has ever worried about
me like this before.
Professional illness. I can't help it.
Detective!
Do you like it?
Which one?
Shall we kiss?
Together?
- Of course.
- Immediately!
Tekin!
- What?
- We're in trouble, Tekin!
- What?
- They know who we are. We've been exposed.
How?
The servant caught me but
don't worry, I took care of her.
- How?
- I wrapped her up in carpet.
You did what?
- Tekin!
- Yes.
Please, let's not pressure her,
because she's still in shock.
Ismail, we're going to play good cop -
bad cop during questioning.
I'm not going to be the bad cop, Tekin. Someone
will hearand I'll Iose my retirement, God forbid.
I don't mean that. What I'm saying is that
I'm going to go soft when I'm questioning the woman.
...you'll ask the tough questions.
- Ask who?
- The woman.
- Which woman?
- Perfect! Continue.
Yes. So your daughterwas kidnapped
and pIaced in a black van this afternoon.
I don't understand. I stllI don't understand.
How can a young girl be kidnapped in
broad dayllght from in front of a hotel?
Well actually, it's quite obvious.
Shut up! For God's sake!
What's there not to understand?
Ismail, now come and be the black van!
- I can't. I don't have carinsurance.
- Ok. Then be the otherman?
- Sir, what are you doing?
- Shut up servant boy!
- Instead of doing nothing, do something useful.
Now, they heId the girl by the arms like this.
They pushed her head down like this.
- Push herhead, Ismail.
- Bashing?
Of course. See how everyone's bashing at theirhorn
Everyone's out of control.
The girI's a screaming mess!
They've covered hermouth. Close her mouth.
Two people held herby the arms and
threw herin the van like this. It's unbelievabIe.
- Tekin!
- We're going straight to the night spot.
- Ismail, you Iet the girl get away.
- You let her get away, Tekin.
So this is how it happened. Now I ask you,
do you have any enemies?
- Yes!
- PIease,just shut up!
- Anyone who is jeaIous of yourwealth?
Actually, there are some peopIe who
wanted a piece of the inheritance.
What! lnheritance? Just keep it all from me!
How much did you inherit from yourhusband?
- Forty mllllon!
- Shit! Liras?
- Euro!
- Come off it. There's no such thing.
- So Suzan, was your daughter betrothed to anyone?
- No, I don't think so.
- It's not an honourkilling then.
- Well actually, the suspect.
- Servant boy!
- So did yourhusband have any enemies?
- Erdal.
- I toId you not to speak servant boy!
- Who is Erdal?
- Sezai's partner.
- Look, he's stllI taIking!
- Erdal is my husband's former partner.
They had a few probIems towards
the end but Erdal isn't our enemy.
- .He's a part of the famlly.
- Aha! The kllIer is the heIp!
- What!
- Don't be afraid, Johnny Guitar!
This is a common expression
we detectives use.
The kllIer is the heIp. ln otherwords,
the suspect may be amongst us, near us.
That's why from this point on, everyone
in this house is equally a suspect.
Me incIuded. That's why I'm going
to begin the questioning...
...with me. Question me Ismail!
- First question! What's yourname Tekin?
What a stupid question. You've known me
since I was a kid! Ask me something else!
What do you call the area where cars
llne up to get right of way?
- How am I supposed to know that?
- You should know. It's boundry crossing!
- Uncontrolled boundry crossing!
- You're going overboard Ismail!
When you say 'jump ship'
where are you jumping from?
- GentIemen!
- Don't interfere!
- Ask me when I last saw the girl.
- Which club did you sell herto?
- That's out of hand, Ismail!
- Tekin, I'm pIaying the bad cop here.
- But you don't know how to question!
- I can neverget anything right can I Tekin?
I've been a good cop all my career...
...and here I am being despicabIe just for
you and you keep giving me shit.
Now, considering the arguments between
my husband and Erdal, you should start with him.
- So you too shouId suspect Erdal.
- I toId you to shut up!
- Take a Iook at this photo.
- Incorrect parking!
This is Erdal's car. lt was shot nearthe
hotel that Pelin was staying in.
I see.
I have some very sad news for you.
- What?
UnfortunateIy the cIues point to one thing only.
- What?
- They may have kidnapped yourdaughterfora ransom.
- Who?
- The kidnappers.
- Who are they?
- The kidnappers.
- What do they want from us?
- Ransom. Jeez, the chick doesn't understand a thing.
Fortunately, that's not our probIem.
Because we as Tops Detectives have
soIved these sorts of situations quite often.
- lsn't that right Ismail?
- No it's not right Tekin.
- What happens at the end?
- What happens to who?
- What happens at the end of these situations?
- Ismail and I start to argue like this!
That's not what I mean.
What happens at the end of these ransom cases?
- Oh. We'll find out together but
as I said, from this point on.
...everyone in this house
is equally a suspect.
- But, Erdal...
- Shut up!
Why do you keep defending Erdal?
Who are you to defend Erdal?
He irritates me man. I know who
I need to be suspicious of!
- I've got it!
- What?
Erdal! I'm changing the whoIe
course of the operation.
We're going to start with Erdal.
Come on Ismail, let's go.
Well I think Ismail, as a staff member,
shouId stay here, right Tekin?
lsn't that right, Tekin?
Yes. I think having a professionaI
amongst you might make things easier.
- Ismail?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- Have you any doubt?
- Well no, of course.
- Well if you did have doubts.
- Just as I expected.
- What?
This is the exit.
But I need a car.
- Adnan!
- Yes?
I didn't want to mention this
in front of Suzan but...
...Erdal called a few times and
asked for Pelin.
- I think that...
- Don't gossip servant boy.
You have it ready. Thank you.
Goodbye.
- Tekin, that car.
- The caris with me. Don't worry.
Tekin! Tekin! Tekin!
Was the one in the back an automatic too?
That was cIose!
I swear.
I think I wet my pants.
Brand new car.
Great!
I swear a convertible is mad.
It's so cool.
- Hello!
- Hello! It's me, Adnan.
Speak up Johnny Guitar.
Now you're probably going to his office.
I was going to tell you not to...
...bother. Go straight to his house because
he'll be Ieaving the office in fifteen minutes.
Am I going to ask you where I
should go and when!
No. I was just trying to be of heIp.
I was going to tell you not to go to
the office for nothing, to go home.
Who are you to tell me what to do!
Who are you!
Cut it short!
Hang up, cops.
Brilliant!
First day of operation; I'm in front
of the girI's father's partner's office.
The weather is mild.
And I'm nevergoing to wear
briefs again. They've crushed my balls!
- What's the time?
- Quarter to three.
How Iong will you be here for?
I have a three o'clock reservation coming.
If you're going to stay longer,
I'll arrange somewhere else.
Ok. I'll be Ieaving in five minutes.
- Then give me a fiver.
- Here you go. Go on then.
- Five bucks?
- Forfive minutes?
- Up to an hour.
- No way. I've got no change.
We'll change it.
- Where are you?
- We're in the car.
- Where exactIy?
- I'm sitting in the driver's seat.
- Location, idiot?
- Location?
Piss off man, forfive bucks man!
Who do you think you are?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
- So who are you?
- No, who are you?
- Who are you?
Who are you?
Be carefuI when you're talking to me.
We can become a crowd really quickly.
- Who are you man?
- Who are you man?
- Who are you?
- Who are you man?
- Who are you?
- Who are you man?
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you man?
- And who are you man?
- Who are you?
- Hey, that was really quick, really.
- Just ask anyone here. They'll show you.
Call when you're near.
I'll pick you up bro.
- He's gone to the office.
- The office?
He had to follow the bogus Erdal,
not the reaI Erdal.
Oh ok. So what are we doing
now, tell me that?
Now get rid of him before he
speaks to someone.
- Give me Bob!
- I don't know Bob.
- Who are you man!
Yes. Bob is someone we
all like very much as well.
- Are you here fora reason?
- You handing overthe money?
- I don't carry much cash.
- Who are you, shit face?
- Handing overthe money?
- Yes, yes.
- Who are you? Bloody Pops!
- Hit the gas.
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.
Adnan's calling.
Speak to him.
- Hello.
- Hello. Where are you?
They're at the fitness center.
What are you doing at the fitness center?
Finish this off quickly.
He hung up!
Give it here.
- Why were we following this man?
Emin, son. Go get the van,
the van.
Hey. How's it going?
I'm going fora swim.
Excuse me, but can I make a request?
- Please do, pIease do!
- Excuse me?
- PIease make a request.
- Take a showerbefore entering the pooI pIease.
What's the situation Adnan?
Everything's going to work out fine darling.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Adnan, if that girl doesn't die, you know they won't
Iet us have a sniff of the inheritance, don't you?
I'm aware of everything darling,
don't you worry.
You might be aware, but are the men?
Will they be able to pull this off?
Suzan I toId you that I'd sort it out...
...but when you tried to create a witness
out of a detective, you got these idiots onto us.
I was taIking about the idiots you found.
Will they be abIe to catch them this time?
Everything's going to be fine darling.
Don't you worry.
All you should think about is what we're
going to do when the whole inheritance is ours.
I already have.
What are you yelling for man?
No yelling, ok!
Just a minute, I'm a detective. There's
nothing to worry about.
Don't scream.
Ok, you're all so bloody precious.
How's it going?
Ok. I'll keep it short.
As Shakespeare said, there are some
things that can be and some things that can't be.
Erdal, Iook, why wouId a person
kidnap their partner's daughter?
You have to answer it like a man.
So tell me. How can a person kidnap
his partner's daughter?
We're speaking llke two gentlemen here.
Do you understand?
Why don't you kidnap the mother,
kidnap Johnny Guitar.
Kidnap him. Better yet, kidnap me!
Ok then, you can have Ismail.
lf I'm not enough, you can have him too.
He can move in with you forever if you want.
Take him as well.
How could you kidnap this girl? Tell me that.
That's what I ask.
How can a person do such a thing to such a beautiful
girl? How could you kidnap her?
You're going to tell me where she is.
You will tell me.
I am asking you a question as a detective
and I expect an answer.
Where's the girl? Tell me.
You've got five seconds...
...or we'll have to go outside and duke it out.
Where's the girl?
This place is hot like hell.
What is this man?
I'm a detective. Answer me.
Let's get out of here quickly.
Answer me! Who are you to not
answer a detective.
I'm pleading with you, who are you?
Who are you man?
Where's Erdal?
Grandpa, how long have you been here?
Did they forget you here?
What happened to you man?
You're a mess, all wrinkled.
Go, save yourself. Get out of here.
Hold on man!
Is the chair free?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- We're knocking him out!
Don't please, don't cry Suzan.
They may never release the girl.
We must be prepared forthe worst.
- They're calling you.
- Who?
They didn't say but
I think it's about Pelin.
- Hold on a second.
- But Ismail.
Quiet! Hello! Hello!
Hello! If you want to see the girl,
listen carefully to what I have to say.
Now you llsten carefully to me.
Bro, why would you kidnap someone's
daughter and sell her off to the night spot!
The girl's mother is in a mess from crying.
Tell me. How much money do you want?
We don't want money.
What we're afterisn't money.
- They don't want money.
- Aha! Give it to me. Let me talk to them.
No Suzan, I'm doing the bargaining.
- So what do they want?
So tell me. lf you don't want money,
why kidnap the girl?
We're not playing games, you know!
You will immediately sign the
necessary paperwork to hand over...
...Sezai's company to Erdal.
Who is Sezai? There's no one here by
that name. You have the wrong number.
Which girl did you kidnap exactly?
Sezai is my dead husband's name.
The woman's husband died and
you're still going on about a company.
What do you want? Tell it straight.
I think they want to take over
my husband's company.
Don't interfere Suzan. So you want the company?
We didn't quite understand.
Yes, idiot! You will sign all the necessary
paperwork regarding the company's...
...transfer immediately.
Or, the girl dies.
They want the company.
But that company means so
much to me.
The girl's become a whore, and you're
stllI worried about the company!
Ok. I'll sign whateverthey want.
Ok. Just bring whateverit is that you want
us to sign but don't inform the police.
And be at the KartaI car yard in an hour.
- Car yard?
- The car yard?
Yes. Is there a problem?
No, of course not but if we don't do as
they say, they may harm Pelin.
- What happened? What do they want?
- Who?
You just spoke on the phone.
They want to meet at the car yard.
That's where we're going to talk.
Talk about what?
Well I didn't get that much detail.
The phone could be tapped.
They're want me and Pelin to sign the
company overto Erdal, isn't that right Ismail?
Didn't I just say that?
Wow! So Erdal was behind all of this, huh?
- Yes.
- Then we'd better get a move on.
- Do we have another five minutes?
- Yes.
Then we have time. Don't
Rush. Go ahead.
- Let's go and have a talk with these men.
- What's he doing here?
Who?
- Let's go.
- I'm coming.
- Car?
- It's ready.
Help me out! HeIp me out!
- Were you here!
I was looking for you.
- You were looking for me?
- Where have you been?
- Why were you looking for me?
I'm going to rescue you.
I'm here to rescue you.
- Looking like this?
- It's all a part of the job.
- Are you a masseuse?
- No. I'm a detective.
Adetective?
Yes, but not like the ones in
America. We don't arrest people.
Ours is more about documentation.
We don't arrest people.
I did it a few times and I was arrested.
It was really distressing.
It seems really stupid when you approach someone
looking like this and say 'You're under arrest'.
No one believes you. Let's say you
and I are together...
...something happens to you,
well than I can intervene.
I can rescue you. In otherwords,
there's no arresting but I can rescue you.
- It's all a part of the plan.
- So you have a plan, do you?
- Well, I definitly do rescue you.
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.
- How?
- How?
- How do you plan to rescue me?
Take a look at yourself first!
Look at yourself!
What plan man?
Answer me, how are you going to save me!
Look, I think you should stop taking drugs
sister cause your head's off this planet.
- What drugs, idiot!
- Let's not scream, dear Pelin.
- How do you know my name?
- I'm telling you I'm a detective!
- Which planet are you from?
- Our office is in Kasýmpaþa.
- Just behind the bread shop.
- I'm going out of my mind!
It's the drugs. Youreye was twitching
like this when I walked in.
So sad. You're so young,
you really shouldn't.
Hold on a minute, what drugs
are you taIking about?
How do you know my name?
Who sent you here? Who are you?
Please, I can't win can I?
- I'm telling you that I'm here to rescue you.
- Who are you to be rescuing me?
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
- Forthe love of God, who are you!
- Answer me!
- And I'm asking you. Don't yell at me!
- Who are you?
- I swear I'm going to smack you!
- Look at yourself!
- Who are you man!
- How did you untie yourhands?
- I'm a detective.
- Untie mine too. Quick!
What for? You keep yelling. That's not
the way kid! You have to be police.
Someone's coming I think. Quiet!
- Where are you? We're freezing man!
- Shut up!
- Pelin?
- What do you want from me?
- Asignature.
No one is kidnapped fora signature.
That's ridiculous!
Don't ever interrupt me again, you shit.
You're going to sign your
father's company overto Erdal.
- What?
- Look, we're speaking English.
We'd better not get Erdal angry, ay?
That's right. The signature is easy.
We'll fix that won't we?
- No! I won't sign a bloody thing!
- Yes, you heard the girl.
You say that now but
you'll change your mind Iater.
Look, I'll smash yourface in!
Look, he's running away!
He could sense that I'd smash his face in,
that's why he's running.
- Untie me too!
- Go on. What a romantic day.
- Yell at me foran hourthen you want me to untie you.
- What romance! Just untie me.
- You said you'd untie me.
- Well I'm not going to.
- I said I'd rescue you.
- What about the pIan?
It's all a part of the plan. I'm not untying you.
You can just trip out a little more.
Hallucinate a little more.
This is a serious case man.
- WeIcome. Welcome.
- Shut up! What are they up to?
- They're downstairs. I tied them up with hogtie.
- What did I just say?
- You told me to shut up.
- Congratulations.
- Downstairs?
- Yes.
Good. Take the girl and the man
to the car yard in an hour.
- Where'd the car yard come from?
- Change of pIan.
- Why?
- Stop with the questions. Just do as I say.
At the car yard in an hour.
Is the doorIocked downstairs?
- It's Iocked. Oh, I'm going to lock it.
- The latch?
Yeah, yeah. Wonder if there'll be
any traffic around the car yard.
Let's not go there, man.
Isn't there somewhere a little easier to get to?
- Ok. Just shoot them in the middIe of Taksim.
- Great!
Where'd you find this idiot?
He's my brother-in-law. He's married to my wife's
sister. He is my brother-in-law, isn't he?
Whatever.
When you get to the car yard and you're
signing overthe documents. Listen carefully to this.
...you shoot the girl.
No shooting. But there wasn't
supposed to be any shooting.
Just shut up. The price doubIes
if there's shooting involved.
- No.
- We have a deal.
We don't have a deal. We can't shoot anyone.
Anyway, blood makes me queasy.
I don't care who does the shooting.
Just finish it off.
Oh, do we kill the man now then?
If the answer's yes, there's also the girl.
What happens to the girl in that case?
She becomes a witness. Well we're going to
kill her not to leave any witnesses behind.
Then the police will get involved.
And there'll be a huge commotion, you understand?
Things will get messy. Wonderwhetherwe
should just kill the man?
You're not going to kill the man, idiot.
You're just going to kill the girl.
- Reason?
- The man's a detective.
We're f...cked. You've done us in.
Hold on a minute. Don't worry. I'm
going to sort it out man.
So how's that going to work?
You're going to shoot the girl while the
company's being signed overto Erdal.
Then that idiot dedective will tell the police
on the crime scene...
...that Erdal's men killed the girl.
And who are Erdal's men?
- Us!
- That's it!
- It's as simple as that then.
- Yes. But just don't forget this.
You're onIy to shoot the girl. Because the man.
- Is a witness.
I see.
- Where's the man?
- He probably had things to do. He's gone.
- He saw that the pIan was moving along without a hitch.
- Hey, how are we going to kill the girl?
For God's sake, who did you take after?
Please!
The man's been expIaining his plan forthe Iast hour.
We're going to shoot the man and then it's finito.
They're going to put the bIame on Erdal anyway.
Where's yourhead?
You're not concentrating.
Everyone's got it, but you. He's saying that we
have to shoot the man. We're going to shoot him.
The girl?
What do you mean, who's Erdal?
He's yourfather's partner.
- Did Uncle Erdal do it then?
- Yes. Who else? For God's sake!
What do you think? The man's done
everything to.
...take over yourfather's company.
Uncle Erdal wouldn't do such a thing.
- Of course he wouIdn't.
Aha! Erdal had a mosque made,
why wouId he do such a thing?
Why not? Listen to what I'm saying.
The men came, they firstly
kidnapped you from in front of the hotel.
...then the same men kidnapped me because
I was following Erdal.
How do you know this?
You're the man from the hoteI!
- Is the seat free?
- Are you following me?
- I am because I'm a detective.
- Detective, my ass! Pervert!
These accusations really hurt.
I'm just trying to do my job.
Your mother hired me to find you.
- My mother?
- Yes.
- I don't have a mother.
- Take that back.
- My mother's dead.
- Who's Suzan then?
Suzan?
She's not my mother.
She's my father's second wife.
I've got to say one thing, good on the woman...
...she treats you like you're her own flesh and blood.
Because I went and I said, ''Suzan...
...yourdaughter's been kidnapped.''You should have
seen the way she cried, the way she fell apart.
...she was shattered. As they say, she was
walling from the heart.
Herchest was exposed when she was crying.
That's how I saw her heart.
- That convinced me.
- What, did Suzan cry?
And that's why we have to get
out of here, I don't know how.
...but I'm taking you
straight back to your mother.
That woman's not my mother I said.
Plus, I'm not going anywhere.
- What are you saying, man!
- I'm not coming, simple as that!
- If I say you're coming then you're coming.
- Don't raise your voice with me!
Then you should be a little more polite.
Just because you have a fantastic body
it doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.
How dare you speak to me this way?
I'll speak the way I want. My career
is on the llne here.
What career you idiot.
Dedective. Who's he kidding!
For God's sake! Are you calling
me a liar!
TaIk to me properly.
Put everything else aside.
...I'm olderthan you for one so you should
show me a little respect ay?
What if I don't?
I'll slap you so hard you'll hit the wall!
Simple as that!
- You won't rescue me?
- That's right!
Oh man, you've been yelling all morning.
Despicable woman!
- Quiet! Someone's coming.
- Don't tell me to be quiet. Of course someone's coming.
You yelled so much that everyone
heard and now eveything's out of control.
- Quiet, we're going to get caught.
- Let's get caught. Our reIationship's not working.
Whatever happens, happens.
I've had enough man.
- On the count of three.
- Are we getting undressed?
Punch stupid!
- I can't hit you.
Maybe I like you. How can you
expect me to punch you?
Not me, you're going to punch the man!
I'm going to punch the man! All you
women are the same!
It's just the first day of ourrelationship and you're
already destroying male bonds.
You're testing me. Well, I'd like
to get to know each other first.
Let skin touch skin. Take the relationship one step
further. It needs time.
- Just punch the man when he comes.
- Oh, punch the man. Great idea.
Ok then.
I thought of that as well.
Below the belt? Ok, I'm ready then.
I'll punch him when you say punch.
- What's going on here?
Brilliant woman, man!
They're getting away!
Bro! Bro!
Shit, man. Where'd they go?
Come on. Hurry.
- Does this carhave stamp duty?
- Excuse me?
- Stamp duty?
- I don't know, probably.
What's I don't know mean, Suzan?
What about insurance?
I don't know Ismail,
I don't deaI with things like that.
But that's not right Suzan.
Now if a cop pulls us over and asks if
we have ourpapers, what are we going to say?
License, registration for exampIe?
See. They got away.
You're useless man!
- Give me a break!
- Come on.
Come here!
Who am I talking to!
- Come here.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- HoId on to me.
Shllllttttt!
- Are you ok?
- Is the house ok?
What house man?
There they are!
Hey you! Wait there!
Come on!
It's the season for it!
Everyone's changing their car.
- What are saying, Ismail?
While we're here, why don't
we buy a car? ASedan.
- Sedan?
- Sedan. You know, the ones with large boots.
They're really comfortable when you go on picnics.
- What picnic, Ismail?
Where are we going to meet the men?
- Somewhere here.
- Somewhere here?
Yes, yes. Like we're trading cars.
We say the secret code, and
we make an agreement.
- What's the code?
- Let's sign the documents, Iet the girl go.
- That's the code?
- Which one?
- Let's sign the code, Iet the girl go.
- Is that what we should say?
- Let's kiss.
- What are you saying, you idiot?
- We have to kiss to make them think we're together.
- Run, they're getting close.
We can kiss while we run.
In here, in here!
- It's clear. Run, run, run!
Come on!
Here, put this on!
- What are we going to do?
- I have a plan,just put it on!
We got away Pelin!
- What's going on?
- What!
You don't open a shop on a public holiday!
Come here you!
- Horsepower?
- Ninety.
- We have a deaI forseventy.
- It's like a woman.
- You say it's like a woman.
- I think we've found the men.
I don't think they're the right men.
Come on, Ismail, let's go.
Suzan, I'm a good judge of character.
Leave it to me, pIease.
- Are we trading?
- Yeah. What do you have?
- An important signature. Where's the girl?
- Here.
Where are you going?
- What's happening there?
- Let's jump.
- Why jump? Let's just walk down from there.
- Let's jump.
No, I won't jump.
Don't jump!
- Are you ok?
- That's luck for you. I landed on the ball.
Hey!
Sorry kid.
- Where'd they go?
Adnan, where are these men?
You screwed it all up.
What! Then go and catch them.
ldiots, you can't get a thing right!
Don't you think I know
this carwas made in Korea?
Everyone knows that Korea doesn't manufacture cars
with more than 70 horsepower!
Get Iost mate! Piss off!
Look, I'm oId enough to be yourfather. How
dare you taIk to me that way? Shame on you!
- Give us the girl!
- They changed the meeting spot, Ismail.
Let's go. It's not them.
Come on, let's go!
I know Suzan. I was
just trying to bargain.
What do you want from us?
What's up? Out of breath aren't you?
Come here you shit!
Is this the bottom end of Salih Mehmet Road?
- Yeah, so?
- What's the time?
-17:00.
- Brilliant!
- Mahmut!
- Who's Mahmut?
- Hey, take a look at this!
- Come here Tekin from Tops Detectives!
Hey you!
- Who are they?
- I don't know.
Back off! Back off!
Hey Mahmut, they even brought the
cameraman, see?
That's Iuck for you...
They're getting away.
Bro!
What are you doing bro?
See how they ran away? A bunch of men
with sticks and rakes in their hands.
Hey, who are they?
I have no idea.
They had a camera.
Hope they don't show us on the evening news.
We'll be a laughingstock,
the wives'll see us.
- Hey man! Where'd they go?
- How do I know?
The pollce! We're going to the pollce!
Where have you been? Everyone's
been expecting you, it's rude you know?
Well the van's tyre...
- Where?
- I don't know, come on.
Can you let me in on it too?
- Ok, ok.
- Ok, get a move on.
This is yours?
Keep going.
Welcome.
- Pelin! Where are you going?
- What's it to you!
- Jeez! Just listen foronce.
- What, what do you want?
Look, I have to take
you to your mother.
That woman's not my mother.
Don't get pissed off darling,
just say it nicely.
You can't run off.
What Ismail!
We have Ismail and Suzan.
If you don't bring the girl immediately,
they both die.
Be at the dockyard with the girl at midnight.
What! Shit! Pelin! Pelin! Pelin!
Stop man, Pelln!
Wait up!
Boss! Boss!
Open the window. Open the window.
- Is he disturbing you?
- So what if I'm disturbing her!
No, I'll sort it out.
You're starting to piss me off!
And now they've kidnapped
Ismail and Suzan.
Who's Ismail?
I said exactIy the same thing. "Why would you
kidnap Ismail," I said?
ls this a part of the plan too?
No. This wasn't a part of the plan. They just
called and said they've kidnapped them.
We have to be at the dockyard at midnight.
Don't try to convince me with ridiculous
things like this.
Tell Suzan I'm not coming.
- They really have been kidnapped.
- Let's go, please.
- Where, man?
- Where are you going?
You can't go. Pelin! Oh, go whevever you want!
All the girls leave me, man. Unbelievable!
Am I always going to be lonely!
Will no one ever believe
that I have a plan!
Am I always going to simply be a part of the plan?
Everyone deserts me. Taxi!
Don't just stand there. Get in!
What! Is there any otherway
to make you give way!
You were right dad. You said I'd
be alone if I lived like this.
Everyone said so but I'm not
a very good listener.
Wish you were here with me. I couldn't
protect Ismail either.
I know what you're about to say.
I was too cocky. Forgive me.
If you could just see Pelln.
I love her. She's a crazy thing.
She loves me too. She says 'which
pIanet do you live on'. She loves me.
This time I'm not going to disgrace you. You're
going to be proud of me.
Let's finish this off.
It's just that I don't understand what
they didn't like about the car market.
PIus, why kidnap me?
Ok, I understand them kidnapping you...
...you're wealthy, but why kidnap me?
I spoke to the detective. He's coming with the girl.
Now tie my hands up.
Do we really have to kill the girl?
It's just that you get 25 years for murder.
- Don't burn us fornothing man!
- Let's wait, she may just die naturally.
Why are you being such cowards?
All you're going to do is kill the girl.
And then you're going to disappear.
Erdal's going to be blamed anyway.
No one's going to Iook for you.
- But don't shoot the detective.
Why?
- The man's ourwitness.
- Shall we shoot the oId one?
Don't shoot anyone but the girl.
The reason I ask is because if we shoot the oId one,
it will be two murders...
...in otherwords,
the money will definitely double!
Will the punishment rise by double as well?
Do we go in for 50 years?
No! Twenty five -twenty five.
If we just kill the girl, I get
twelve-and-a-half years, that's all.
- That's for grievous bodily harm.
- So we're going to harm a body as well?
Now if we're also going to harm
someone.
All you're going to do is shoot the girl.
Don't shoot anyone else.
- Ok. I've got the girl.
- Ok. I've got the old man.
Look, the man's been telling you
to just shoot the girl, not the man.
As Iong as you don't shoot me.
Who are you? You're Erdal's men.
You're going to be rough with us.
You're the murderers so that ourplan
isn't understood.
You're going to be rough with us.
- Can you pIease slow down a llttIe, sir.
- Hey!
- Did you speak to my daughter? Is she coming?
- No we didn't speak to her, you oId frump!
Please, a llttIe slowersir!
Are you going to get me to kllI you!
Shut up!
Look, you think you're scaring me but...
...I'm a retired traffic cop my boy.
- Don't worry about him. Let's tie this one up.
- Shut up!
- Ah! Adnan!
There he is.
How's it going?
Did you bring what Erdal wants?
That's sorted. I settled it.
I spoke to Erdal.
- What are you saying? Where's the girl?
- That's the question indeed.
Untie Suzan. I have spoken to Erdal.
Who did you say you spoke to exactly?
Look, didn't you want the girl
to sign the documents?
Well, I sorted that out
with Erdal. Everthing's ok.
- With Erdal?
- Yeah.
Erdal's here, son.
Who'd you speak to?
- Here?
- Here?
- Here?
- Here.
Isn't this slient fellow Erdal?
Yes, that's Erdal. So Tekin, who exactly
did you talk to thinking it was Erdal?
That's Ismail, not Erdal.
HoId on a minute. Who did you say
you spoke to exactly Tekin?
Now I rescued the girl. She's a beautiful girl
and we look good together.
We went to Erdal together.
Listen. We went to Erdal.
We went to his house and I said,
"What sort of person are you?"
Then I went forit - held nothing back.
"What sort of person are you?" I said.
"How can a man kidnap his closest
friend's daughter?" I said.
"What would you do if we were to kidnap
your daughter?" I was really hard on him.
Thankfully he ended up being sensible.
He understood and feIt really ashamed.
He said, "Please detective,
don't detective." and so on.
- I'm going to shoot him man.
- Don't! Don't! Don't!
And he said, "Untie Suzan."
He said, "Say please.'' He said...
... "There are going to be two brave
and handsome men there...
...and if one of them just happens to
be holding a gun."..
...he said to "be really careful because there's no
joking with guns". Erdal was saying that about you.
- What's he saying?
- He says Erdal.
The fool's lying.
He's lying. Erdal was always
here with us.
You're not helping, Ismail.
- Let me shoot him, bro.
- Shit! No.
You're not helping me either, Tekin.
I get tied to chairs like this as the key man
of such an operation...
...and you still won't let me
get a word in.
- Should I hurt the old man?
- Stop!
Was it me that got you tied up?
You got yourself tied up!
Why are you hurting the old man?
He's the girI's grandfather.
I came here to save your life
and you keep telling me off.
I've made a decision. I'm moving to a seaside
town and I'll open a driving school there.
What schooI man!
You don't even have a licence.
I swear I'm going to shoot him.
I'm really confused man.
Don't. The man's a witness. Shoot the woman.
Shut up! You ungrateful thing!
How many times have I cleaned up your mess!
I witnessed your circumsion you shit!
I've seen all your bodily parts.
How can you reveaI oursecrets
in front of everyone like this?
- It's Tops, not Pops!
- That's enough!
Move overand give me the gun.
Useless Popss.
The woman's stressed out man. Suzan,
everything's sorted. There's no need.
- Be quiet!
- Don't blow your cover Suzan.
Quiet! Quiet!
What did I say to you?
- So I don't have a husband!
- That's not what I'm talking about stupid!
- Check out!
- I said find the girl and bring herto me.
Did I ask for much?
It was so easy that even an idiot like
you could have done it but what did you do?
- I found the girl.
- I have been waiting for years.
...forthat senlle man to die and just when it
was my turn.
...an idiot like you appears before me
and ruins all my pIans.
...but I won't allow it,
do you understand!
- Is that gun real?
- Tell me, where's the girl?
Don't Suzan.
But he's ourwitness.
- Tell me where the girl is.
- Suzan, you can't shoot him. He's ourwitness.
- Shut up!
- Shit!
- Shit! My leg!
Did you see that? She shot
the man in the leg?
Now listen. Tell me where
the girl is or I'll kill you.
Tekin! She's going to shoot.
Tell her where the girl is!
Look, if she's going to shoot us, then
she'll definitly kill the girl. She's her stepmother.
Her stepmother?
You hussy, you!
Quiet! Tell me where the girl is
otherwise I'll kill Ismail right here.
Suzan, darling, don't let the devil
get the better of you.
- Shut up you demented Pops!
- Erdal, check this hussy out!
Look, I'm counting to three. Tell me now
otherwise I'm going to shoot Ismail!
Suzan! That's enough.
You're messing with our life.
Our life already got messed up because
of yourstupid men.
You shut up too.
Three, two, tell me.
Let me and Ismail go otherwise
I'll kill myself.
Go on then fool!
But then you won't find out where the girl is.
He's right.
Do you know what it's like to be shot?
- No. Hopefully this will be the first!
- Good. Let me do the honors.
PIease do, Suzan. It's tough when
things don't go as planned.
I know that all too well. Some
of us make plans all ourlife.
...and some of us just end up being
a part of the pIan. But I'm not like you.
I respect experience.
Don't everforget what ourfathers say; the weakest
moment is when you feeI the most confident.
Ismail!
- Son!
- Where are you going Ismail?
Come here you!
Tekin! Come here you shit!
I'm telling you to come here!
Come here!
Come here!
Come here!
- Untie me.
- Untie me too Erdal!
He's not Erdal, Ismail!
Oh dear!
Come here Pops Detective.
- This is not the end of this!
Suzan!
Look,just untie me.
I know first aid. Just untie me.
I'll get both of them up on theirfeet.
- Where are you Suzan?
- Suzan!
- Come here! I'm going to kill you!
Suzan, this is not the end of this.
Where are you Suzan?
Get lost!
Suzan!
You'll go in there and
you'll be in for it.
- Just as I planned.
- Here I am.
You can't escape me.
I swear. Come here, Suzan.
- Tekin! Come here.
- Come here!
Tekin!
Ok, calm down.
Put your hands up in the air. Up.
It would be hard not to fall from here man.
What a mess.
I've gone way out to sea, man.
Here I am, Ismail!
This is not the end of this!
Caimly, caimly. Bend my head.
Let go! Let me go!
You're finished too, Adnan!
You're finished too, Adnan! I'm going
to destroy you too Tekin!
Come here Tekin!
Officer, I'm drifting way out man.
- Officer! Can you pick me up as well?
I'm a detective. Ismail!
- Wow, I wasn't hit.
- See!
- Bro!
- Hey!
- What?
- Get up!
Hey, I thought I just got shot.
I fainted, but I wasn't shot.
I fainted cause I thought I saw blood.
Didn't I say I'd get them both on theirfeet?
It's so cold.
I'm sailing to the other other...
I'm here!
Then we'lljust keeping heading this way.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Don't be upset dear. They won't
be abIe to harm you anymore.
I'm sad for my father, not me.
He was never aware.
So is there anything else I can do for you?
- No Uncle Erdal.
- The crazy thing's here to rescue me.
- Who?
- Pelin.
- Were we rescued by that girl?
- Well, yeah.
Suzan planned the whole thing.
Pelln just came with Erdal.
Of course. I knew that Suzan planned
everything from the start.
- You knew!
- Of course. Look Tekin, son...
...the girl comes and says
her daughter's been kidnapped.
She has a phone number, we
tell her to call, she won't.
It was so obvious that she planned
the whole thing.
She thought she'd kill the girl
and get the whole inheritance.
Those things aren't that easy!
Isn't that right son?
- So why didn't you say anything?
- Adventure's sake.
- Adventure?
Don't tell the detective
that I came to you ok?
- What ever you want.
- Thank you for everything.
- Come and stay at ourplace for a while, if you want?
- No thanks, Uncle Erdal.
It will do me good to get away for a while.
Ok, it's up to you. See you then.
- Bye.
- Ok.
- Compliment me when the girl comes, ok?
Excellent Tekin. Brilliant.
You've got excellent reflexes.
- Thanks.
- Watch out forthis boy.
He's got really good reflexes. Really good...
Tekin's reflexes are really good.
That's Ismail for you.
Also, it was quite
a fine act of you to come and rescue me.
My pIeasure. What happened to your hand?
These sorts of things happen all the time
because I'm a detective.
- I...
- I...
- You first.
Ok. Pelin, despite everything we went
through, it was kind of beautifuI.
We can say it was fate but regardless of what
you do...
...we're from two different worlds.
I know. Why did you just say that?
Oh. So that's what you think.
- Thanks for everything.
- You're weIcome.
- Goodbye.
- Tekin, sir, can you please make a statement
regarding the incident?
The police seem to think that you
played a big part in this.
Are you proud of yourfirm?
Well, we as Pops Detectives.
Wait, that's wrong, Tops, not Pops.
Tops! Tops!
The ransom payoff ended at the police station.
The daughter of a businessman was kidnapped..
