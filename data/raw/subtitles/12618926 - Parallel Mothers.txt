{\an8}MADRID 2016. WINTER.
Can you smile with your eyes?
Now relax your face,
look the other way and turn to me.
That's it.
PARALLEL MOTHERS
Rest your arms on the table.
Your chin...
Without pressing it.
Now the other one.
Very good.
Can you smile a bit?
Look at me.
Look at the lens.
Your coffee.
Janis, do you want the skulls now?
I don't know, I'll tell you later.
Shall we sit down?
What are the skulls for?
They asked for a Hamlet pose,
like that, with the skull.
But I think it's too obvious
to have a forensic anthropologist
with a skull.
-We're not doing it.
-I'm glad.
The editor said you wanted
to ask me something.
Yes.
If you have a minute
we'll talk after the session.
Sure, no problem.
I wanted to ask you
about excavating a grave.
Go ahead.
Outside my town
there's a grave with ten bodies.
One is my great-grandfather.
When the Historical Memory Law came out
the judge for my town recused himself
and since then
we haven't gotten anywhere.
It's worse now,
they've withdrawn all the subsidies.
President Rajoy boasted in an interview
that in the State Budgets there were
zero euros for the Historical Memory.
-I read that.
-It's outrageous.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
Sure.
In the Historical Memory Association
in my town,
we have a very complete dossier
of the grave.
Do you know exactly where it is?
The whole town knows,
that's why it hasn't been touched.
My grandmother left me all the details.
The grave is here.
They took my great-grandfather away
at the start of the war,
the first week.
How are you so sure of the place?
One of the victims
that Franco's soldiers buried,
Manuel Blanco Trujillo,
wasn't dead,
just badly injured.
At night he got out of the grave,
made it home and told everything.
Before he escaped,
he told his family where the grave was
and who was in it.
My great-grandfather.
He was a teacher and a photographer.
By chance, before the war,
he took photos of all those
who later died with him.
Nicasio Sanz García, the Carlist.
Facundo Nuño Tomé.
José Gutiérrez Castro
and Francisco Alonso González.
Gregorio Sánchez Muñoz, Pug-nose.
César Cruz Arranz.
His daughter Brígida is still alive.
Teófilo Robles García.
Pepe Medina Sánchez
and Benito García Rodríguez.
My grandmother.
She wrote down the names of all those
who disappeared with her father.
I'll show them to you later.
Some families are still in the town,
others aren't.
Some are from the next town.
All this information
makes things easier.
The association
has been saving a bit all these years.
We'd like to know
what it would cost to hire you privately
to do the excavation.
I'd do it for free,
but I can't do it on my own.
The whole town would help you.
We need specialists
in archaeological excavations.
Pick-and-shovel workers can't do it.
Of course not.
Even so, the whole town
will do anything to help.
I'm improvising...
I belong to a private foundation,
the Association for the Recovery
of the Historical Memory.
-I knew that.
-You did?
Yes, but I didn't dare.
Some wine?
It's a scientific foundation
and it investigates everything to do
with our cultural roots.
Our work isn't opening graves,
but things are so precarious
we've already intervened in one.
It depends on where it is,
when it was,
if it gives us new information
about the war...
For example,
the fact that the one in your town
dates from the first days of the war
is an interesting detail.
It was the night of July 25,
according to my grandmother
and others in the town.
You could present the project
to the foundation.
I'll make sure that
at least they consider it.
I really appreciate that.
But it wouldn't be immediate.
The foundation decides on its projects
years in advance,
but it's worth us trying.
Of course.
Thank you, really.
I have to leave early,
I'm taking my husband to the doctor.
Of course.
How is he?
A bit nervous.
Poor thing.
Yes?
Hello, Janis. How are you?
Hello, Arturo.
I'm calling because the foundation
has received the dossier.
They'll contact you.
I sent it all three days
after I took your photo.
Just one thing...
I'll be in Madrid next week
to do an appraisal
and I thought we could meet,
if it suits you.
What day?
Next Wednesday.
I'm free in the afternoon.
I'll see you Wednesday then.
See you then.
Breathe through your nose.
Deeply.
Not like this...
That's worse.
That's it.
Don't be scared.
Everything's going to be fine.
You'll see.
Are you married?
No, are you?
Me?
No.
So we're both single mothers.
Mine was an accident
but I'm so happy.
Mine was an accident too.
I don't regret it.
I do.
Poor thing, don't say that.
It'll all work out, you'll see.
You're not on your own, are you?
No, I'm with my mother.
OK.
She still hasn't gotten used to the idea.
She will.
Ana!
Shouldn't you be in bed?
It's good for her to walk,
it helps the baby drop down.
I'm Janis, her roommate.
I'm Teresa, her mother.
Where's the room?
There.
Shall we go?
Take it slowly.
I spoke to your father.
He can't come.
I guessed that.
He wishes us luck,
and you're not to worry.
Yeah.
Here I am.
Hello, sweetheart.
Does it hurt a lot?
They're about to give us an epidural.
I'm dying to see Cecilia's little face.
Me too.
What your grandmother
would give to be here...
-That's Ana, and her mother, Teresa.
-Hello.
Elena is my best friend.
A pleasure.
You're both almost ready, eh?
Almost, yes.
I'm going to push...
That's good.
Rest, breathe in.
Breathe slowly.
-I can't...
-Yes, you can.
You're doing very well, love.
I can see her head.
I can see her hair.
She's got hair!
It's amazing!
Don't be afraid, she's there.
Come on, one last push.
One, two...
and now push hard!
Push hard.
That's it, she's here now.
Hello, my darling.
You did very well.
There, there, my love.
Yes?
A nurse told me you were here.
Ana! Come in and sit down.
I'm delighted to see you.
How's your baby?
She's fine.
She's in observation.
They only left her on me
for a little while.
Isn't it wonderful to hear
her heart beating over yours?
I'm longing to get her back.
Is she in observation too?
Yes.
It must be the normal thing.
When mine was born, she was suffering
from extrauterine inadaptation,
so the doctor told me.
Not a great start,
because that's the life ahead of her,
extrauterine.
Yes.
But apparently it's nothing.
She had trouble controlling her breathing
outside of the uterus.
What's wrong with yours?
It seems her blood sugar was a bit low,
but they told me too it's nothing.
I'm sure of it.
I'll give you my number
in case you want to call me.
As we're in the same situation,
we can talk about things.
When are you getting her?
Tonight, I think, or this afternoon.
Me too.
The cell number is mine.
I'm giving you the house phone, too.
Yes?
Hello.
May I?
Hello, love.
How was the audition?
Fantastic!
I was there until now.
I was going to do one of the friends,
but I asked the director
to try me out for Rosita,
which is what I'd prepared at home
without anyone asking me.
But Doña Rosita is the lead.
Yes.
He let me do it
and he was delighted.
Then he asked me to read
a very difficult final scene.
He gave me two or three indications
and I connected immediately with that
faded, frustrated part of the character.
That's great, mom.
So he told me to learn
a few more scenes
to continue with the audition tomorrow.
I kind of ambushed him
but he liked it
and he was surprised,
I could see it in his face.
Can you imagine if I do Doña Rosita?
Congratulations.
It still isn't certain.
I know they have another actress
for the part,
but I can always dream.
I'm delighted for you.
Thank you, darling.
Are you two feeling well?
Yes.
Croquettes, Clarissa made them.
Where are the babies?
They're fine, they're in observation.
I'm off. See you tonight.
Bye, Deborah.
I don't understand this set-up.
She lives here like a duchess
and doesn't even help out.
She has to study during the day.
It's the only way
to have a babysitter at night.
She goes too far, that Deborah.
And she eats like a horse.
No!
If you see her using the mobile a lot,
tell me.
It's non-stop.
You'll wear out my finger.
Isn't she beautiful!
Be careful, I've just got her to sleep.
Yes, yes. I'll see you tonight.
Call if you need me.
I'm amazed they've given her the part.
I think she really overacts.
She's very happy.
Every day that passed was
like an intimate garment
that was torn from my body.
And today a friend marries
and another
and another,
and tomorrow she has a child
and he grows,
and she comes to show you
his exam results,
and they make new houses and new songs,
and I am the same,
with the same trembling,
the same.
And one day
I'm out walking and I realize
that I don't know anyone.
Boys and girls who leave me behind
because I get tired.
And one says: "That's the old maid".
And another, handsome, with curly hair,
who comments:
"No one would want to touch her now".
And I hear him
and I can only shout:
"Let's keep going",
with a mouth full of poison
and an enormous desire to run away,
to take off my shoes,
to rest
and not move again,
ever,
from my corner.
You're ready to open, Teresa.
Thank you.
We've finished for today.
About the opening,
it's the same date, but not in Madrid.
Why's that?
The theater still won't be free by then.
We'll do a small tour of the provinces.
During the week
I'll have more information.
So we're postponing the opening?
No, we'll just open outside.
In Bilbao or Valencia,
they'll let us know.
It'll be good to open in Madrid
with the play smoothed out.
You could have told us sooner.
I've got things for next month
here in Madrid.
I've just heard,
and you've got time to get organized.
-But I can't leave Madrid.
-We'll talk now.
I'll give you details
of the tour tomorrow.
If you have any problem,
now's the time to sort it out.
See you tomorrow.
I can't leave.
My adolescent daughter is at home
with her newborn baby.
I can't leave them.
You have to sort it out,
that's how theater is.
You told me we'd open in Madrid.
But that's impossible.
I'm sorry.
I'll see what I can do,
but I don't know.
Ana,
the theater where we were going
to open in Madrid isn't free.
They've just told me
that we'll tour
the provinces for a few months.
A few months?
Yes.
It's breaking my heart.
I don't want to leave you,
but I've waited my whole life
for a chance like this.
It could change my career.
But if you ask me to stay,
I'll stay.
You know I won't ask you that.
What if we call your father and tell him
you're going back to the town?
He'll be delighted.
To have me and the baby?
Don't be ridiculous, please.
If I leave the company,
I'll never work again.
And I won't be away all the time.
Monday to Wednesday we don't work,
unless we're in Barcelona.
Then go on tour.
But I need help.
You'll have to find a nanny
so that Clarissa can have a break.
A cousin of hers would do it.
I like her and she's got experience.
I don't want a stranger.
-Talk to her about it.
-Of course.
And ask dad for money for my upkeep.
Remind him I'm still a minor.
Don't worry about money,
that isn't a problem.
Ana should go back to Granada,
to her friends. She knows nobody here.
I don't think she wants to come back.
Call her and ask her lovingly.
Promise her it's the best place for her.
Show a little interest in her,
after all she's been through.
If she comes back,
it'll just stir things up again.
I can't miss this chance.
It's horrible that
we're arguing about this!
Ask her if she wants to come.
I'd like to hear that you have
a minimal interest in her going back.
Remember that by law
she's your responsibility.
You took her from me
and look at how you sent her back.
That's not what we're talking about.
Well, now you know the situation.
Call me and tell me what you decide.
Hello.
Hello, Janis. How are you?
Very busy, you can imagine.
I'm in Madrid.
May I drop by and meet Cecilia?
I'm not presentable,
and I'm really busy...
But give me an hour, OK?
OK, thank you.
See you then.
Can I tell you something?
When I finish the course
on Hispanic Philology
I'd like to enroll
for Classical Literature.
Can I carry on staying here?
I don't know.
If you stay,
you'll have to pay more attention.
You're very scatterbrained.
And don't put on the headphones at night!
No...
You do as you please!
I'll get it.
Leave us on our own. Don't appear.
Hello.
Happy anniversary.
Anniversary of what?
It's a year today
since we first slept together.
Is it?
Is anything wrong?
I'm pregnant.
And what are you going to do?
Have it.
I've gone over it a thousand times...
I didn't think it could happen,
but I've always wanted children
and I'm almost 40.
Time is passing.
Yeah.
Sorry, I'm kind of in shock.
Yeah.
I love the idea
of having a child with you,
believe me,
but I don't know
if I can allow myself that now.
It isn't a matter of
allowing ourselves that,
it's already here.
-Not yet. There are alternatives.
-I'm going to have it.
My wife has cancer,
she's right in the middle of chemotherapy.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It isn't the time to tell her
I'm having a child with someone else.
I've told you
because I thought you should know,
but I'm freeing you
of any responsibility.
I'm following my family's tradition.
I'll be a single mother, like my mother,
and my grandmother.
Janis, please.
At least consider the possibility
of not having it now.
We can plan it for the future.
But this is the future.
Our relationship
was very clear from the start,
no commitments,
on your part or mine.
I don't regret anything,
I've been very happy with you.
So have I,
that's why I want to protect this.
I don't think our relationship
is strong enough to survive this.
What do you suggest?
That we separate,
with no hard feelings.
The baby is my concern,
but to cope with this
we'll stop seeing each other.
Don't say that.
If we keep in touch,
we'll keep screwing
and in a few months we'll end up
having the same conversation.
It's better to end it now.
Hello.
It's been a long time!
I've lost all notion of time.
-Here, for both of you.
-Thank you.
It's cute.
I was waiting for you to call,
but as you didn't, here I am.
Can I see her?
-Yes, she's asleep.
-I won't wake her.
-Come on.
-Thank you.
Look.
-Can I touch her?
-Of course.
She's going to be very dark like you.
Yes, she's very dark.
Who do you think she looks like?
I think she's got my father's features.
I thought you never knew him.
I didn't,
I'd have been a few months old.
My grandmother said he was Venezuelan,
with almond-shaped eyes.
The same eyes.
Yes...
She's going to be very pretty.
Well...
And how are you?
Fine.
With a lot of work, like always.
Are you all organized?
Do you need anything?
I've got an au-pair
who helps me with the baby
and I saved enough
to take a few months off.
-I can't be away from her now.
-Of course.
Would you like a drink?
No, I've got a very early start.
I just wanted to see you both
for a minute. I'm off now.
Well...
She's beautiful.
You've done a good job.
Thank you.
I'm working in the morning.
In the afternoon I'll be in the hotel,
the usual one.
Call me if you want.
OK, so long.
Goodbye.
Hello.
Come in.
Give me a second,
I'm sending an e-mail.
OK.
Sit down.
That's it.
-Would you like anything?
-No.
I'm listening.
Since the baby was born,
I'd been looking forward to your visit,
even though we'd decided to separate.
You decided that.
Yes, I decided that.
But I imagined you'd be curious
to see your daughter.
I was.
I've been struggling all these months
not to call you
until I couldn't take it anymore.
I was so excited
about seeing her and seeing you.
So what happened last night?
And don't tell me that nothing happened.
I think the baby isn't mine.
What?
I didn't recognize her.
-What does that mean?
-It's what I felt.
What you're saying
isn't very scientific.
I don't think she's my daughter.
You mean it's another man's?
I don't know. You tell me.
During the time we were together
you were the only man I slept with.
Do you really think
the baby takes after your father?
You know I never met him.
I only know what my grandmother said
and she never met him.
Do you have any photos of him?
No, I don't.
If I'd wanted to fool you
about your paternity,
why would I have asked
that we separate?
If I'd intended to lie
I'd have stayed with you.
When we split up
I didn't ask you for anything!
Why would I fool you now?
I don't understand it either.
To end my doubts,
let me do a paternity test.
No.
Janis, please.
It's best if I leave.
Don't call me again.
If there's any news about the grave,
someone else can call me.
I'm sorry we still have
that matter in common.
We're adults.
We don't have to mix things.
And stop thinking about your pride.
If there are doubts,
the only answer is to do the test.
-I have no doubts.
-But I do.
Very well.
Janis!
What'll I do with this foot?
I'm going to eat this foot.
Yes?
Janis, it's Ana.
Ana who?
We had our babies together.
Oh, Ana!
Forgive me, love.
I had a fight with my baby's father
and I'm furious.
I thought he was out of the picture.
He really is!
This won't happen again.
How are you, and Anita?
She's right here, I'm changing her.
She's wonderful, really.
What? What are you saying?
I hear her.
I'm a bit tired, to be honest.
I need more sleep, but I'm fine.
Doesn't your mother help you?
Oh, my mother...
My mother comes and goes.
She's in the provinces now
on a tour with
Doña Rosita the Spinster.
What are you saying?
Haven't you got a nanny?
Yes, and the maid helps me out too.
You were right.
Anita is a gift,
she's all that matters to me.
Of course.
And how is yours?
I think she's beautiful.
I'll come and see you
and they can meet each other.
I'd love that.
Listen, I have to go now.
Call me whenever you want.
I'm delighted to hear from you,
even if you're angry with that man.
Kisses, 'bye.
Now, my love, go to sleep.
I'm going to the hospital.
The washing machine's on.
When the duchess gets here,
tell her to hang out the clothes.
-I can iron them tomorrow.
-Yes.
How is he?
It doesn't look good.
Yes, my love, yes...
You have to sleep.

-How's the website going?
-Very well.
-And how's the audience today?
-3,000 and rising.
Great.
Excuse me a moment.
Yes, Janis.
Do you have a minute?
No, but go ahead.
I'm going back to work.
I don't like the au pair girl.
I want to hire a proper babysitter.
If you need money, I can help you out.
Thanks, Elena, but I need to work.
Is there anything immediate
in your supplement?
Nothing immediate.
The big stuff is already allocated.
What's left?
Still lifes of accessories.
Shoes, jewelry, a few belts...
Nothing else.
I'd be delighted to photograph
shoes and belts.
You're too good
a photographer for that.
I need to work.
If it's not outside of Madrid,
I'll do still lifes of anything.
I don't mind.
I'll come and see you about it,
and see the baby as well.
I was thinking
that you two could move in
with me for a while.
I've got lots of space,
there's the garden...
We can keep each other company.
Thank you,
but it would be a real upheaval,
and it's far away.
I'm very well organized here.
OK.
I'll see you later.
Do you need anything?
No, thank you.
I can't stand her, I swear.
She's enjoying it.
Let's get out,
so you don't catch cold.
What a lovely little baby.
She's getting more ethnic, eh?
She's like your father.
Exactly like him!
I don't know what he was like.
Wasn't he Colombian?
Venezuelan. A dealer, my grandmother said,
but who knows?
I thought you were sure.
No.
Who else could she look like,
apart from the anthropologist?
Because she doesn't look like him.
No!
I only slept with Arturo.
Then she looks like your father,
that's it.
Right, Cecilia?
You're like your Venezuelan grandfather.
I'm off.
I'll see you tomorrow in the office
about the photos.
Something will come up.
And think about coming to my house.
No.
You're so stubborn.
See you tomorrow.
What an angel face.
Let's see you pose for mom.
Let's see...
She's getting angry.
What a bad temper.
This came for you.
Thanks.
Look at her, pretty as a piglet.
Thanks!
They said that to me
and see how pretty I turned out.
Labgenetics.
Gloves must be worn.
No smoking.
There can be no organic remains
in the mouth.
We have to leave it for tomorrow.
Darling...
What?
Let's see, little one.
This side.
This side, my love.
There, my love, that's it.
So that we can both stop worrying.
REPORT ON BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION

JANIS MARTÍNEZ IS NOT
THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER OF CECILIA MARTÍNEZ
NOT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
100% PROBABILITY
Méndez Law Firm.
May I speak to the lawyer
Mauricio Méndez?
He's in court now.
May I take a message?
No, I'll call later.
Yes?
May I speak to Ana?
This is Janis.
She can't take your call,
she's bathing the baby.
She'll call you later.
It's all right.
I just wanted to ask how the baby was.
She fusses a bit at night
but she's beautiful
and Ana is a great mother.
Of course.
Thank you, goodbye.
NOT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
Hello?
Hello, Janis. Did you call me?
No.
Maybe by accident,
I've just put it in my purse.
That happens at times...
Are you all right?
I've got a lot going on.
I'm going to get rid of the au pair and...
Domestic problems, nothing important.
You sound upset.
You've got me at a bad time.
I can't talk now, I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Arturo,
and thanks for calling.
'Bye.
I'm sleeping with the baby tonight.
Shall I help you?
No, I'll move her.
Come to mommy.
I love the color.
Our pleasure.
Hello.
I'd like to change my number.
What phone do you have?
This one.
But I'd like to keep
all that's on this one.
No problem.
-You're sure?
-Yes.
The earphones again!
I've told you 1,000 times
to put her on her side!
If she vomits, she could choke!
Come here, my love.
Don't you understand what I say?
You've been here for ages
and you've learned nothing.
I don't want you to stay on.
But I've enrolled.
I don't care. Find another house.
I'm not leaving her with you
for another night!
I've had enough.
Hello.
Come in.
Here I am with Cecilia.
Hello, Cecilia.
Leave the baby carrier here.
Well, darling...
She's a bit cranky,
I've just woken her.
Don't worry.
Aren't you a beautiful baby?
I'm very nervous,
it's the first time we've been separated.
Don't worry,
I'll be watching her the whole time.
This'll be like her second home.
Here... That's it.
Do you leave her on the floor?
Yes.
You mustn't force any position,
she'll decide what's best.
I've brought what you asked for.
The wipes, a change, the bottles...
The cream and... that's it.
Perfect.
And you've got my number.
Great.
Darling.
Yes, my love.
I'll come and get my little mouse later.
I love you.
Thank you.
I'll see you later.
Excuse me.
I've got a little girl.
What can I get you?
Hello.
Coffee with milk and a blueberry muffin.
Ana?
-Are you Ana?
-Yes, Janis, it's me.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You've changed so much!
I didn't recognize you.
-You look wonderful.
-Thank you.
I'll bring you the coffee.
May I sit with you for a minute?
Of course.
How long have you been here?
I haven't seen you.
Almost a week.
So we're neighbors.
What a coincidence.
To be honest,
I came to your house,
but then I felt silly
and didn't buzz you.
I came in here to have something
and the head waiter offered me a job.
Well, I asked too.
And now I've got a room in his house.
And your mother?
She's in Barcelona now, doing theater.
She never stops.
She's finally a success.
She left you on your own?
Yes, I call her occasionally
but I still haven't told her
I've moved out
and I've forbidden Clarissa
to tell her.
When she comes back
she'll get a big surprise.
So you ran away.
I'm an adult and I'm just a burden to her.
And your father?
He still has no idea.
What a family scene!
I'm used to it.
I'm broke, but for the first time
I'm in control of my life.
I'll do OK.
I'm sure.
I can't stay,
I've got a taxi waiting.
Wait.
Don't worry, my treat.
Yes?
Thank you.
What time do you finish?
Today, at 9:00.
Shall we meet at my place?
You've got the address.
Sure.
I'm delighted to see you.
Same here.
Goodbye.
Thank you for the coffee and...
Good morning.
Where are we going?
17, Quintiliano Street.
We're on our way.
Hello.
Thank you for inviting me.
What a lovely home!
Thank you.
This morning, with the rush,
I didn't ask about your daughter.
How do you manage with her
now that you're working?
Do you leave her in a nursery?
You have long hours.
What is it?
Are you all right?
Anita died.
Don't tell me that.
But she looks so well.
What happened?
A crib death.
But from what?
A crib death,
that's what it's called.
She died in her sleep.
What symptoms did she have?
None.
She was perfect.
Her brain forgot to breathe.
Cerebral immaturity, the doctor said.
Immaturity?
During the first year, apparently,
a baby's brain isn't developed
and it can forget
to give the order to breathe.
Can't anything be done to prevent it?
No, it's a very rare case.
It happens once in a million times.
But Anita was perfect, you saw that.
Excuse me.
She's beautiful.
Do you want to see her?
Please.
How was your siesta, my love?
A friend has come.
-May I pick her up?
-Of course.
Will you come with me?
You are so beautiful.
She's so big.
Aren't you pretty!
Hang on.
Yes?
I'm the café manager.
I was to meet Ana.
I'll tell her now.
Ana!
It's the café manager,
he's waiting downstairs.
That's right, I have to go.
She'll be down now.
-She's a wonderful child.
-Thank you.
Could you send me
that photo of Anita?
Of course,
but you've changed your number.
I've called you lots of times and...
I'll write it down for you now.
I'll get my backpack.
Here it is.
I'll send it to you now.
I'm so sorry, Ana.
Really.
Thank you.
Well...
Goodbye, love.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Ana.
Come here, my love.
I'll see you at my place at 9:00.
OK, Ana.
'Bye.
Everything all right?
Yes.
You seem worried.
We're running late.
I'll see if Dana's ready.
If I skip tonight's event,
we could have dinner together.
No, I can't tonight.
I'm going to shake them up.
How do I look?
It'll be easy to show
how beautiful you are.
I'm a bit nervous.
It'll be very easy.
You know it's my first time
on the cover of a women's magazine?
It was about time!
If you like, we can start lying down.
If you're uncomfortable about anything,
tell me.
Like this?
Like that, very good to start with.
I love how that looks on you.
You just keep moving around,
as you wish,
however you're comfortable.
Very good.
Yes, stay like that.
Perfect.
Very good.
It's Ana.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm making a potato omelet.
Will you help me?
Where's Cecilia?
I've just got her to sleep.
You can see her later.
Have you ever peeled potatoes?
No, I've peeled oranges, apples...
It isn't the same,
take this and watch me.
You see?
Like this.
-It's easy.
-Very easy.
Now you wash them,
go on.
Shake them,
to get rid of the grit.
The most important thing
is how you cut them.
Take that pink knife.
What's important
is the thickness of each slice.
The thickness.
Look.
Like this, very fine.
Without cutting yourself.
How much do they pay you at the bar?
500 euros plus tips.
I was thinking that Dolores
might be leaving me soon.
Her husband is very ill.
If I want to keep working,
I'll have to find someone.
Of course.
I could give you 800 euros,
without tips, but with room and board.
Are you asking me to work here?
Yes.
What do I have to do?
Look after Cecilia and the house.
Take her to and from daycare.
Look after her at night,
because I'm really exhausted.
I'll give you a hand
when I'm free.
Of course, it's a deal.
Think about it, it isn't any favor.
I'm almost taking advantage of you.
No, I don't need to think.
I'd love to do it.
Isn't it beautiful!
I don't know if I'm prepared
for what you're asking.
I'll teach you
how to run a house and cook.
But right now I really need you
to look after Cecilia.
OK.
If you don't like it,
you can go back to the bar.
But you have to commit
to at least a week.
I'm delighted, really.
Look at that beautiful girl.
And she likes you.
She's so cute, and so good.
Good.
Very good, my love.
What about your mother?
I told her I've moved out.
-She was stunned.
-I can imagine.
She flipped.
She was furious with me.
I'm not surprised,
she's your mother.
She went off on a tour
when I was in the middle
of a depression.
I was in a terrible place,
but now I want to live.
It's the only lesson
I've learned from my mother.
Live my life and be free.
It's what she's always done.
And I rang my father to tell him
I'm staying in Madrid to work.
What did he say?
He was really pissed,
but I don't care.
I might change my number
so I won't have to listen to him.
Will you unplug the camera?
Wait, I'll help you.
Put your things in the closet.
I have a co-sleeping crib too,
and a little stroller.
Well, I've got everything.
If you want anything,
I can get it from my mother's house.
I have the keys.
Thank you.
-Do you have a bouncy chair?
-No.
They love that.
My Anita really enjoyed it.
It probably still has her smell.
That's true,
I hadn't thought about it.
Janis...
Are you all right?
Yes.
I missed her.
-Do you want to take her?
-No.
I have to get used to it,
and to sleeping.
I've missed out on a lot of sleep.
Are you sure you're all right?
You're sweating.
Lie down here with us
for a while.
Come on.
-Have you had breakfast?
-No.
Have you brushed your teeth?
Or chewed gum?
No, why?
I'm going to take
a sample of your saliva.
Open your mouth.
More.
It's for an analysis.
Is this how they do it now?
Yes, I'm going to get
a full analysis for you.
And for Cecilia too.
And you too, my love.
You're doing it very well.
Today you'll go with Dolores
so you get to know the stores
where she shops
and what we usually need.
Sure.
I'll write everything down.
I'll be back now.
We're going now.
I'll leave Cecilia at daycare
and then we're going shopping.
A kiss, my love.
Wave goodbye.
Have fun.
'Bye, mom.
See you later.
RESULT ON BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
OF MATERNITY
ANA MANSO IS THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
OF CECILIA MARTÍNEZ
PROBABILITY 99.9%
Teresa?
Hello, Janis.
Is this a bad time?
I was working.
I'm sorry, is Ana here?
No.
They told me in the bar I'd find her here.
She'll be back in a while.
But come in.
This is my day off
and I came on the train,
but I've got a show tomorrow in Barcelona.
Can I get you anything?
A coffee?
Brandy?
I think Dolores
keeps something around here.
At times she drinks
because her husband is very ill.
Oh, dear.
Do you smoke?
All right.
But on the terrace.
Of course.
I'll get a jacket, it's cold.
I don't know what Ana's told you about me.
Very little.
I married to get away from my parents.
A year later Ana was born.
But I had no calling
to be a mother or a wife.
I wanted to be in the theater.
I'd done it at university.
So I divorced Ana's father
through the Roman Rota.
You can't imagine that...
A horrific humiliation.
You practically had to say you were
a whore so they'd annul your marriage.
I accepted all the humiliations
so I could be free
and devote myself to acting.
Fortunately, money wasn't a problem.
The father got custody of Ana.
He remarried immediately
and had another family in Granada.
He's still there.
But you still saw Ana, didn't you?
The father took his revenge on me
through Ana.
He hardly let me see her.
He put up lots of obstacles
to make me suffer.
I did small parts
in theater and on television
and suffered from seeing her so rarely.
In the end, it wasn't worth
giving her up.
I started late to be an actress.
30 is already late for starting
and looking posh
doesn't help in this profession.
It isn't a profession for the posh.
Actors are all left wing.
And what are you?
I'm apolitical,
my job is to please everyone.
How did you get Ana back?
Her father sent her to me
when she got pregnant.
You could have taken the chance
to win her back.
Yes.
But I'm hopeless,
and it was a bit late.
Ana was traumatized.
We were two strangers.
I did what I could,
but after a few months
the Lorca came up.
Immediately after,
the opposite character,
the junky mother in
Long Day's Journey Into Night.
I couldn't say no.
I'm 47,
and I had to grab the chance
to prove that I'm not an intruder,
that I'm an actress with talent.
I was the worst mother in the world,
I know.
I'm not like you.
I don't have a maternal instinct.
It sounds terrible.
I'm sorry for Ana,
she was very unfortunate
with both of us,
her father and me.
No one deserves
what she's been through.
When Anita died,
I was doing a season in Madrid.
But after a month I had to leave,
and it broke my heart.
Honestly,
I left because Ana didn't seem
to care if I did.
Do you think that the baby died
because of the situation you were in?
No!
Didn't Ana tell you?
A crib death, the doctor said.
An hour before, she was normal.
Ours isn't exactly a model family,
but Anita never wanted for anything.
Ana never left her daughter,
day or night.
Ana really surprised me.
After she gave birth
she suddenly became a grown woman,
responsible.
The baby never wanted for anything.
Maybe that's why I allowed myself...
We're back!
Mom, what are you doing here?
I've come to see you.
Would you like to go to your room
and have some privacy?
No, we'll go out to the street.
Yes.
Thank you, for everything.
You're welcome.
Won't you feel cold?
No, I love this jacket.
You didn't have to leave home
to change your hairstyle.
Do you live here?
Yes, in Janis' house.
And what do you do there?
I look after the house and the child.
You're working as a maid?
I can't believe it.
Did we give you an education for that?
Mom, I have to work.
Your father can find you
a decent job in Granada.
Don't talk to me
about my father or Granada.
Hey, Ana! How are you?
Hello.
What'll you have?
A tea for me, please.
A strawberry ice cream.
Thanks.
After Anita died I heard you
arguing with dad on the phone.
It didn't suit either of you to have me.
I was too depressed to make a decision
but as soon as I could get up
I left home and I'm not going back.
And much less to his house.
I'm an adult,
so you live your lives
and I'll live mine.
Now we put the fish
on top of the potatoes
and if it dries out
we add a little bit of wine.
OK.
It's my mother.
Apologizing.
Answer her.
I don't know,
I don't want to be more cruel to her.
Well, say that.
Mom, I don't want
to be more cruel to you.
Go on, she'll love it.
Who's that hippy?
My mother.
-Are you the baby?
-Yes.
I was just a few weeks old there,
we were in Ibiza.
You know she called me
after Janis Joplin?
Who's Janis Joplin?
That's her singing.
My mother also died at 27
from an overdose.
It was summertime
and the living wasn't easy.
I was five, but I was already living
in my town with my grandmother.
Is that your grandmother?
That's my great-grandmother.
This is my grandmother Cecilia.
She took care of me and reared me.
One day you'll have to come
and see the house where we lived.
Whenever you want.
To your grandmother Cecilia,
to your mother,
to your daughter,
and to you.
And to you.
It's here.
FOREVER LOVED BY YOUR MOTHER ANA
AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER TERESA
Did you tell the father
that the baby died?
I don't know who he is.
Aren't you curious to know?
There were three of them, classmates.
We were really drunk and high
in the home of one of them,
the one I liked.
His parents were away
for the weekend.
I was really blasted.
I screwed with the one I liked
but the others had filmed us on a phone
and they threatened
to post it on Internet
if I didn't do it with them too,
and I had to screw them.
But that's rape!
Two days later
they said the same thing,
either I screwed them again
or they'd post the video.
So I went to my father
and told him.
-And he reported them?
-No.
He wanted to avoid a scandal,
and also for my sake.
Your sake?
Yes, so I wouldn't have to suffer
the pressure from the media and all.
When I found out I was pregnant,
he sent me to my mother.
You should have reported it.
Those boys might keep on raping
if they're not stopped.
I didn't have the strength.
I was terrified about a trial,
the police, the press.
I didn't want to relive it over and over.
Look.
That's them?
Go to sleep.
Give her a kiss.
Go on, chubby cheeks.
Elena?
I doubt it, she'd have called.
I'll go and see.
I'll put her down.
No more joking around.
Who is it?
It's Arturo.
Hello.
I've called you several times
but something's wrong with your number.
Yes, I changed it.
I've got great news,
but I'd like to see your face
when I tell you.
Wait for me in the tavern.
I'll be right down.
Great.
Who was it?
An old friend,
I'm going to meet him.
I changed my number
and he couldn't find me,
so he came here.
Why didn't you ask him up?
I feel like some fresh air.
And dinner?
Are you going to eat here?
I don't think so.
What would you like to have?
A cold white wine.
To celebrate what you have to tell me.
You promised it's good.
Yes.
The foundation has decided
to open your grave in July.
You're going to open our grave?
But that's in three months.
The board will inform you officially
if you can give me a number.
I'll do that right now.
Have you got a pen?
In July?
I'll direct the excavation,
the foundation supplies
the technical means.
I don't know how to thank you.
There's nothing to thank,
that's why I dared come directly
to your house.
This is my new number.
Were you avoiding me?
You? No, heavens!
It's a long story,
I'll tell you one day.
You look wonderful.
Is everything OK?
I'm working a lot,
but it's all good.
And Cecilia?
She's great.
-And you, your family?
-Fine.
My wife has fully recovered,
according to the doctors.
I'm delighted.
We're separating.
I told her about us.
Now? Why?
I didn't like the feeling
of hiding it from her.
I felt terrible having to lie to her.
Go back to sleep.
You smell of alcohol.
I drank a bit of wine.
Go back to sleep, go on.
I'm not awake.
I'm dreaming.
It's delicious, the wine is delicious.
Go back to sleep, it's very late.
I'm tired.
Were you with your friend all this time?
Yes.
Did you screw him?
No, why would you say that?
You had lots of time.
We were talking and drinking.
I'd forgotten what that was like.
Your friend from last night?
His name is Arturo
and he's the father of my child.
You told me you wouldn't see him again.
We had a lot to talk about.
Are you jealous?
I don't know.
What were you talking about?
I'll tell you another time, OK?
I'm meeting Elena for another cover,
I have to leave now.
And Elena?
What?
I think she likes you.
We've known each other forever...
But it's true,
I think she's always liked me.
In any case she respects me,
if that's what's worrying you.
I have to go.
When you want to go out, tell me.
I don't want you here like a prisoner.
All right?
But I want to go out with you,
so you can show me new places
and we can get drunk together.
We'll have to get drunk here,
because who'll look after Cecilia?
Don't make me late.
I'll have to go back
to drinking in the street.
So, what about your friend
from the other night?
-Arturo?
-Yes.
He's a forensic anthropologist
and he belongs to a scientific foundation.
They're going to open the grave
where my great-grandfather is.
That's what we were talking about,
and we were celebrating.
You're obsessed with the grave
and that man is taking advantage of it.
What?
You have to look to the future,
otherwise you'll just open old wounds.
Who said that? Your father?
Yes.
Do you think that?
I don't know.
I've never thought about those things.
It's time you knew
what country you're living in!
I don't like you talking to me like that.
No one in your family
has told you the truth about our country.
There are over 100,000 people missing,
buried in ditches or close to cemeteries.
Their grandchildren
and great-grandchildren
would like to disinter them
and give them a decent burial
because they promised that
to their mothers and grandmothers.
And until we do that,
the war won't have ended.
You're very young,
but it's time you knew
where your father and his family
were during the war.
You need to know,
so you can decide
where you want to be.
I just want to be where you are.
That isn't relevant now.
Don't you care
that I want to be with you?
Leave it.
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
You're tired of me, aren't you?
No.
Then what's wrong?
Did you sleep with Arturo
and you don't want to tell me?
No.
The problems are with myself.
During all these months
I've been keeping something from you.
That you don't love me
and you want me to go?
That you've decided
to go back to your child's father
and form a family with him?
No.
Then what is it?
Come.
Look carefully
at what I'm going to show you.
It's very important.
Do you understand what it says?
It excludes Janis Martínez
as biological mother
of Cecilia Martínez.
I'm not Cecilia's mother.
I don't understand.
Look at this other report.
"Biological..."
"Ana Manso is the biological mother
of Cecilia Martínez".
But I'm Ana Manso.
Cecilia is your daughter.
What?
I guess that...
they swapped them at birth.
"Ana Manso
is the biological mother
of Cecilia Martínez".
I don't understand.
I never did a maternity test.
I did it for you,
without telling you.
Remember when you'd just got here,
with latex gloves?
Why didn't you tell me before?
That's Cecilia,
I'll check on her.
My little princess.
My daughter.
Are you my little girl?
Janis,
I'm going crazy.
Are those reports true?
Why would I lie to you about this?
But where's your daughter?
What have you done with her?
They swapped them,
I told you.
You mean that my Anita was yours?
I'm sure of it.
They must have changed them
the day they were in observation.
Since when have you known?
When you came here I already knew
that I wasn't Cecilia's mother
and Arturo wasn't the father.
We both had doubts,
that's why I did the test.
So you already knew
when I told you Anita had died?
Yes.
I was going to tell you
about my suspicions, I swear.
I called you, as soon as I found out,
but I backed out.
When I invited you for dinner
the first time,
after meeting you at the café,
I was going to tell you.
But when you said that your daughter...
who would be mine...
had died...
I couldn't do it.
I was terrified of losing two children
at the same time.
You never thought about me?
All the time.
You never put yourself in my place.
Living together, sleeping together...
You kept it quiet all these months
and didn't give a damn about me.
Is that why you changed your number?
So I couldn't find you?
I guess so.
Yes, mom.
I'll explain it all.
I'm bringing Cecilia with me.
Not the mother,
I'm going on my own with her.
No, I'm going to take a taxi.
I'll see you soon.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to my mother's house
with Cecilia.
She's very happy.
Did you tell her?
Not yet.
Stay, please.
Please, give me time
to get used to the idea.
It's best if we separate
so I can take all this in.
But can't we analyze
the situation here,
together, like two adults?
The hardest part was telling you
and I've done that.
I can't bear you taking her away.
You've complicated things too much.
We'll have time to talk later.
Up you come.
Can you take the bags?
Let's go.
My darling, I love you very much.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Yes?
Arturo... It's Janis.
Are you in Madrid?
Yes. Is something wrong?
Can you come, please?
She has some of my mother's features.
It was horrific to find her
when she was already dead.
Hello.
Did I wake you?
Ana...
I'm groggy from the tranquilizers.
I'm sorry that I left like that,
but it was...
It was a very difficult situation,
and I'm responsible.
It's fair that I'm punished.
I'm not punishing you.
You can come and see her
when you like.
Thank you.
I'm much calmer now.
It isn't easy to understand all at once,
but I'm worried about you.
We have to sort this out between us.
The worst was last night.
Now I have to detach myself
gradually from Cecilia.
I'd come and see you right now,
but it's best if I wait a few days.
You can't stop seeing her
just like that.
No, of course not.
I'll call you when I feel up to
seeing you.
We have to talk about us too.
I don't know where I stand with you.
Yes.
We'll talk about everything,
whenever you want.
Kisses.
Here.
They told us it was here.
First we'll visit the woman who's ill.
Aunt Brígida.
She may not even last to July.
The two granddaughters
will be there too.
Perfect.
Janis, this is wonderful!
I'm so happy to see you!
You look beautiful!
And so do you.
This is Arturo.
He's heading the excavation.
Delighted.
-And your grandma?
-She's inside.
She dozed off waiting for you.
She was so anxious
she didn't sleep last night.
Go on in.
Thank you.
Grandma, they're here.
Aunt Brígida!
Don't get up.
I thought you'd never get here.
Sit down.
This is Arturo, an expert.
He's in charge of the excavation.
We'll take samples of your saliva.
With a jab?
No, with a cotton swab.
If you have to jab me, jab away.
I'm like a pin cushion!
She isn't well. I told you already.
Open your mouth.
Very good.
That's it.
I'm very ill.
I hope for just one thing.
That they find my father
and I can bury him with my mother.
And she wants us
to bury her there too.
I won't last long.
Grandma, don't say that.
The cancer is consuming me,
but my dream is
to reunite the whole family.
In life we couldn't be together,
at least at the end we will be.
Tell me about your father.
I was four months old
when they killed him.
And she has memories of him.
I remember what my mother told me.
And what did your mother tell you?
Lots of things.
When they came for him,
my father had me in his arms.
He was playing with me.
My mother used to tell me,
and it's as if I remember it
from thinking about it so much,
that the last thing my father did
was play with me.
I had a rattle.
We never saw it again after that.
My mother looked for it all over the house
but she never found it.
I guess he took it.
Hello, Herminia!
How are you?
Fine.
This is Arturo,
he'll direct the exhumation in July.
Thank you so much,
we can't believe it.
Janis will have told you.
Yes, she did.
Come in.
Thank you.
The patio is beautiful!
Sit down.
Those wafers!
I haven't seen them in ages!
They're for you.
Is there any detail you remember
about your grandfather?
A lot, but we didn't know him.
Grandmother told us about him,
when she decided to talk.
Until just before she died
she never opened her mouth.
She was afraid.
We were all so afraid.
Grandfather was tall and handsome,
with beautiful eyes.
Just one.
The other was made of glass.
You don't see it in the photos.
My great-grandfather took that photo.
Did your grandmother say
if he carried anything regularly?
A watch, a pen,
a pipe, a piece of jewelry?
My mother told me that he never
took off his wedding ring,
not even in the fields.
-His wedding ring.
-Yes, never.
And inscribed on the inside
was the date of their wedding
and my grandmother's name, Josefa.
He was wearing clogs
when they took him.
They didn't give him time
to change his shoes.
My grandmother inherited
this house from her mother
and I inherited it from her.
I spent my childhood here.
My grandmother
was born in this room,
and my mother.
There's something here.
It's a casing.
-How was the drive?
-Great.
Look who's here!
Hello, Elena.
Hello, Cecilia. How are you?
How are you?
How about a kiss?
She's a bit cranky.
She doesn't like the car.
How are you getting on?
Fine.
So many years
waiting for this moment.
You don't know
how important it is for us.
I can imagine,
for us too.
Do you need anything?
No, we'll eat in the town.
Well, coffee and water, if you can.
I'll bring that now.
You can go and get settled in,
this'll take a while.
About how long?
It depends on the depth,
but three or four days.
But come whenever you want,
and the townspeople too.
Yes, they all want to come.
Let's go home.
-Are you all right?
-Yes.
See you later.
I'll bring the drinks now.
I'll drop by my house
and then bring them water and coffee.
We could go in the afternoon.
Let me know when you want to go.
Are you all right?
I really want to cry.
Let me know later.
It's so rural!
Yes, very rural.
I didn't want to modernize it.
No, I love it.
Do you like it, Cecilia?
Do you?
I'll show you around later.
All right.
You're going to have
a little brother or sister, Cecilia.
Do you know which it is?
No, it's too soon,
I'm only three months.
Have you thought of any name?
If it's a girl, Ana.
I like it.
If it's a boy, Antonio,
like my great-grandfather.
Do you like it?
My great-grandfather
was having dinner right here
with my great-grandmother
and my grandmother,
when the fascists came in
and took him.
They didn't even let him finish eating.
When he came back at dawn
he was pale and covered in mud.
He'd spent the whole night
digging his own grave.
The next night
they came for him again
but that time he didn't come back.
Why didn't he run off
after the first night?
I guess he didn't want to be separated
from his wife and daughter.
And out of pride and dignity.
I don't know.
If the femur goes in that direction,
the pelvis should be there.
Be careful with the pick,
the skull should be in that area.
So we'll continue?
A phalanx.
And a button.
They tied their hands with barbed wire.
The rattle.
I'm going to put a marker here.
Then we'll take a photo of that.
Good afternoon.
This is your moment,
we'll withdraw.
NO HISTORY IS MUTE.
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY BURN IT,
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY BREAK IT,
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY LIE ABOUT IT,
HUMAN HISTORY REFUSES
TO SHUT ITS MOUTH.
