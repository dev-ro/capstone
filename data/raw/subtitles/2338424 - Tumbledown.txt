In the middle,
you feel like it's
never going to end.
But he was with me.
I was going to make it.
I remember that morning
Hunter made me a deal.
He'd clean out the
basement if I swam
all the way across the lake.
I dove right in.
Our basement was a nightmare.
It turns out that
gliding along behind me,
that's when the last song
on the album came to him.
The first time I brought him
here to show him where I grew
up, he decided that
this was where he wanted
to write music,
have a zillion kids,
have a yard big
enough to get lost in.
To become part of
the wilderness instead
of just part of some scene.
Most of the songs on the album,
I don't really know
where they came from.
But I was there for that one.
So I hold onto that
track as the one
that we wrote together...
together
as it was supposed to be.
Because the plan was never
to live in the frigging woods
all by myself.
But here I am, still
way out in the middle
without him.
Don't look at
in that tone of voice.
Mister popular today.
All right.
Do you have any books
on how you write books?
You know, all the
rules and grammar,
semicolons, and whatnot?
Yes, I would recommend,
"The Voyage Out"
by Virginia Woolf.
It's on the fiction aisle,
bottom shelf, lilac spine.
I'm ready for my
next assignment.
Hannah, don't waste
your time, right?
I'm giving the column to
somebody else this week.
What?
Who?
I am done playing the fiddle
to you procrastination dance.
Hey, Upton, no.
Don't test me today.
I... I worked all morning.
I did.
Give me interview.
Come on and make
it a good one?
Esther Greely,
birthday number 88.
Bless her heart.
Now, 600 words, and I insist
you spend the minimum amount
of time on it.
That "Franklin Journal."
It's always striving
for excellence.
Yeah.
Did my,
special order come in?
The biographies?
Yes, the did.
I have to be well-versed
in the full spectrum
of the genre.
Well, this ought to do it.
That's going to be
some good writing.
Here.
Give me that.
All right.
You have such loose morals
behind the cash register.
Thank you.
You know what?
Keep that one.
I don't want that.
Well, you might.
Maybe I do.
You're going to love it.
Hey.
Hello.
Ok, guys.
Out we go.
Come on.
Come on.
You have two unheard messages.
First message...
Hello, Ms. Miles.
It's Andrew McCabe again.
You know, I'm not sure if you're
getting any of these messages.
But I still would like to speak
to you about your late husband.
I've been studying his work...
ANSWERING MACHINE
RECORDING: Message erased.
Next message...
Come on.
There you go.
Well, maybe you'll
pick up on of these days.
So in the meantime, I'll just
go ahead and tell your machine
a little bit about myself.
I'm a scholar, writer,
associate professor...
Good boy.
at Hofstra University in pop
culture and American studies.
Go!
Go fetch!
Andrew McCabe.
Let's see.
Professor.
Stalker, possibly.
Well, congratulations.
You write for the internet.
Hannie.
Hi, Hannah.
Hi.
You brought a bird.
Had to evict this
little critter.
A rare little fellow.
Aw.
Thought maybe you'd
want to tend to him.
You know, I... I actually
just sat down to do some work.
I'm on my lunch
break presently,
and I guess I thought
a bird in the hand
was worth me in the bush.
HANNAH'S GREETING ON ANSWERING
MACHINE: Hi, I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Noodle.
Noodle, are you there?
It's Mom.
Mom?
You're not going to
like this, sweetie,
but apparently there's some
tight-jeaned fast talker
from the Big Apple who
showed up in town today,
riding some fancy motorcycle.
He's been asking everybody all
sorts of personal questions
about Hunter.
No!
So I guess you got another
muckraking type on our...
What?
Mom?
Hey, what?
From New York?
Yeah, hi honey.
I guess he teaches at
Hofstra or something.
Anyway, he's in the Chickadee
Suite at the Mount Bloom motel,
in case you want to
pay him a little visit.
No, ok Mom.
I got to go.
Hofstra?
Hello?
Hofstra?
You in?
Yes.
Upton?
There's some underhanded,
citified star-humper
all up in my grill.
I think he's at the coffee shop.
Will you come with me,
and help me crush him?
Please?
Crush me?
What the...
I could fling you
like a Frisbee.
Ok.
Told you she
was a spunky one.
I love spunky.
Hannah, this is Andrew McCabe.
We were just talking about
some really cool stuff.
-And...
-Yes.
You know, he teaches at...
-Hofstra.
-Hofstra.
That's right.
Yeah.
So you want the
restraining order now,
or you want to wait
for the libel suit?
Sorry?
You parasites are done running
Hunter through the rumor mill.
Got that?
Boy.
Talk about barking
up the wrong tree.
I mean, if you're talking about
magazines, I agree with you.
They're trash.
No, I'm writing a book.
He's writing a book.
Traitor.
Look it, everybody that
matters is going to be in it.
Ok?
But Hunter Miles could
be it's heart and soul.
All right.
Well, you're awfully tenacious.
I'll give you that.
Thank you.
But my husband was
a person, a real man.
And every song he ever wrote
and everything he ever touched
is mine.
Got that?
Mine.
The end.
Mine.
This, crazy widow
routine of yours...
Does that work on people?
I mean, it seems a
little over the top.
Sorry, that's too much.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hey, look.
I've got respect fathoms
deep for everything
your husband had to say in
those shattering songs, ok?
There was too few... So
where'd you get that?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Whoa!
Come here!
Hey!
Give that back!
Ok.
Lady, look, that's
not yours to ruin, ok?
Sorry, one second.
Please!
Will you give me back my book?
Are you... It's like a snow
globe in here.
It's a lot of work went
into this, you know.
Go ahead, sir.
Please, please.
Are you kidding me?
Who does this?
You make a very lousy
first impression.
You know, there are
many stages of grief.
Yeah?
Hannah is currently
going through vandalism.
Yeah.
Spunky?
Thanks for the warning.
Lend an open heart
to Hunter's words,
and you soon recognize
that these were always
wounded impre...
Impre... imprecations
from some distant remove, a
windswept field of high grass
and dying light,
otherworldly, illusion.
The man was singing
from transcendence
long before his soul floated
across that deep, cold river.
And he shines with hope.
He pulls you beneath the
covers for a flash-lit whisper
session, shining onto who
we are, what we run form,
and who we open our
hearts to become.
I'll make
other plans to meet you.
On a distant shore
I've got to choose you.
Be your guiding light
on the horizong.
Sends you.
HANNAH'S GREETING ON ANSWERING
MACHINE: Hi, I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Hey, look... I just
assumed after a couple
of years you might
be ready to talk about him.
I misjudged that, and
I am really sorry.
But your husband means
a lot to me, genuinely.
But I... I'll tell you what.
I'm... I'm getting something
to eat at the diner,
and I'm leaving town, ok?
But I... I really want
my notebook back, man.
Or what's left of it anyway.
All right.
All I've decided is
that I'll listen to you.
Ok.
There's going to be the sound
of chewing for a minute.
You got 30 seconds.
Make your case.
Ok.
Well, I'm not going
to need that long.
I want to make your
husband immortal.
That's a cruel thing to say.
No, no, what's cruel
is, you know, no matter
how good his music was, it's
getting buried in an avalanche
of cheesy singles.
Someone needs to build
a monument to raise
them up above the rubble.
Right, and that's you?
Associate professor
of truth on your hog?
It's not a hog.
It's a cafe racer.
It's European.
Come on.
Order up.
Here.
I
Got a few questions
Yeah, well, me first.
So, this book of yours.
It's not gossip.
It's not reference.
It's not fiction, ok?
But it is wildly romantic.
It's about the chorus of
lost voices... artists,
poets, musicians,
all of whom failed
to navigate out of the...
The woods of their youth.
And to understand why,
what I'm trying to do
is deconstruct the
edifice of commodification
that I believe our society has
entombed the creative urge.
I mean he's like the patron
saint of this whole ethos.
You know what?
I'm not that worried.
Nobody's reading this book.
What do
you want to know?
Yeah... ok, so... so
Hunter grew up in Philly.
Yeah, he's a drummer
in a punk band, right?
Suddenly, he's singing his heart
out on the edge of the Earth
with an acoustic guitar.
How the hell does that happen?
He loved it up here.
Did he?
I mean, he loved you.
And you're from up here.
All right, yeah.
The whole thing's my fault.
Can I get that out
of the way for you?
-Yeah.
-You know what?
I'll, I'll take that
home for the hounds.
Are we done?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You know what?
What I really want to know
is, you know, like, ok.
Here is a sensitive
soul who gives
us a single, nearly-perfect
album in the woods of Maine.
Right?
And then before
all the... you know,
the tours, and the radio play,
the chaos, the corruption,
he's gone.
You know, what happened?
Like some
accident or something?
Yeah... I'll be right back.
Hey, Hannah, just
let me talk to you...
Ok, McCabe.
You got good taste in music.
You've got your theories
about consumer blah blah.
And here's the deal.
Any monument that gets built
for him, I'm laying the bricks.
Ok, will you...
Hold on, all right?
Whoa!
Hey!
Easy.
Look, I just want to
say, man, I'm sorry.
I'm terribly sorry
you want to just
let him slip away for good.
You know, I hope you
get promoted, or rich,
on "The View," or
whatever it is that made
you haul yourself up here.
Get off my truck.
You're condemning a
genius to obscurity.
Work on this with me.
I am working on it, dickweed.
I'm writing hi biography.
What?
Wait.
Hold on.
Stop.
Roll it down right now, please.
Come on.
Let's talk about this.
Please!
Ok, fine.
Fine.
Nice meeting you.
She just stonewalled me.
I mean I don't If I can
use him in the book at all.
That sucks because, I mean, he
would have been the cornerstone
of the whole frigging...
Look, he wrote one
surprising album.
He had a lot of potential.
And it sucks that
he died so young.
Yeah, but hon, how many
stacks of dissertations
have been written about,
you know, I mean, hell.
You got Cobain,
you know, Buckley,
Arbus, Elliott Smith, Nick
Drake, David Foster Wallace.
On and on, you know?
You know, Hunter Miles...
Uncharted territory.
Walk
out on a frozen lake.
Tenure in the bag, man.
Lost my mind in...
No, no, no, this does
not make or break you.
Come downtown with me.
I scalp three bands a
week that are much more
cutting edge than Hunter Miles.
I know that, honey.
But that's what's
so great about him.
You know, there's nothing...
Nothing cutting edge about him.
You know, he's timeless.
Owen?
Hey, to Hunter Miles.
Echo, echo all within.
Rewind and then erase.
Mainstays and saving grace.
Mainstays are my rest...
Hannie.
And the space pod
zoomed across the horizon.
The captain roared in
his reptilian voice,
"Lizardbot, unleash
your!"
Ha!
Unleash!
Hannah.
Hannah Miles.
-I'll come back.
-Get over here.
I didn't know you were a fan
of "The Worm of."
Here.
Just
read it, please.
That's part of an
intro, and then
something like a first chapter,
and then some epilogue.
It's a... it's a start, right?
There is some
interesting stuff here.
It's just that I know what
you're capable of, you know?
When you're on, you're
like a fanged wolf
howling from a mountaintop.
But this is a toothless piglet.
You know, lost in the woods.
Great.
Thank you.
Hannah, you're
attempting the impossible.
It's ok to ask for help.
Yeah, well, thank you, Upton.
But I'm not going to
drop this in your lap.
Well, you're welcome.
But it's not my lap
I'm thinking of.
Never.
Fiction
or autobiography?
Pose or confession,
Biggie was as much
defined by, as he was killed
by, his 10 crack commandments.
So I ask you, what does that
mean to hinge your street cred
on your own mortal evanescence?
That is all.
And hey, just to look
ahead, after the break,
we're going to be diving
into the Kool Herc materials.
So start thinking
cultural appropriation,
sampling the break, which
is not the same thing
as copy-pasting your midterms
from a Wikipedia page.
Mr O'Brien, busted.
Professor.
Nice surprise.
What are you doing here?
I thought you might
like some sushi.
Lifesaver.
Yes, very much so.
Yeah, we'll eat over here.
Hold on one sec.
Hello?
Hi, it's
you uncooperative widow friend.
Well, hello there,
Ms. Hannah Miles.
How are you?
I'm good.
How's New York?
Full of too many
people, as always?
So here's the thing.
This, research,
or whatever it
is that you're doing on my
husband, I... I don't like it.
And Hunter would have kicked
your ass for so many reasons.
But I also think that
he would have respected
your take on the songs.
Well, I'm sorry.
Respect me?
The muck-raking,
star-humping dickweed?
Did I forget any?
I am willing to let go
of my first impression.
Good, good.
Well then, me, too.
Hold on a second here.
Psychotic, ball-busting
widow... poof... to the wind.
Proceed.
You know, you're
just the last in a long
line of bloodsuckers coming
here to dig up dirt, so you...
No, no, no, I'm
not digging up a damn thing.
What are you doing?
You just calling
to screw with me?
No, no, no.
I, I have a
proposition, a proposal.
Have you ever
written a biography?
What?
Ok.
I see what's going on here.
You're just a crazy person.
Yes, apparently, because I
think you have half a brain.
And I need it to help me distill
a life of an incredible person
into a couple dozen
thousand words.
But... I mean, I've got
a book deal with Random
House and a pub date, you know?
I mean, what do you got?
Nothing.
Well, I got the
truth of his last 10 years.
I give you access to all
the fun stuff there... sheet
music and drafts of his lyrics.
Ok, ok, hold on.
Let's just talk this through
for a second, will you?
All right, so
I write this bio.
We write this bio.
We write it?
Like together?
Wh... Ok, I call left
side of the keyboard.
No, we co-author it.
Your... your name goes on
the spine right under mine.
Ok, Hannah, I have an advance.
Well... well, Hunter's life
insurance policy wasn't huge,
but, I can do $40,000.
Are you kidding me?
Jack it up.
Jack it up.
What do you mean, jack it up?
It's like five times my
advance, plus she's giving
me the keys to the kingdom.
$50,000.
That's all I got.
Ok, look, take your time.
Think it over.
I tell you what, Ms. Miles.
You just bought
yourself a typist.
Yes!
What?
Really?
Ok.
So I... I guess that means
that you'd be coming up here.
Yeah, yeah.
We, we got spring
break coming up.
I have a guest room.
You could, you could stay
in the... in the guest room.
Yeah, yeah, no, I
guess that would work.
Ok, well, I will
see in vacation land.
I will bring my swim trunks.
Ha.
Sunlight
Keep me on a.
Worn out my welcome.
Sing you never in a song.
Oo-oo.
Ok.
Strange man into our house.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
Look at these guys.
-Have no fear.
-Look at that.
These are the hounds.
This is Ripkin.
This is Lover.
Ripkin.
Lover.
Excellent.
Hi, I'm Andrew.
Hello.
Yeah.
-That's what I smell like.
-Yeah, ok.
He's not shy.
Ok.
We'll take you in here.
Yeah.
Come on.
In we go.
Bed time.
Bed time.
-Hello again.
-Hi.
Yeah.
You know, it's, nice
to be in business with you.
How were the roads?
I'm unmarked,
tractionless, waking nightmares,
no blindness.
You...
Yes, no, yeah, please.
That would be helpful.
I mean don't get me wrong.
I know I find moonlight as
romantic as the next guy.
But kiss my ass if I'm
expected to drive by it.
Ha.
All right.
You city people, you have this
whole "don't mess with me"
exoskeleton.
But you're generally
just such pussies.
I mean this will be
done by the morning.
It's just a tease.
Sure you don't want some tea
or something to help you...
No thanks, no, no, no.
That's all right.
No, you know what?
Maybe you could just show
me where I'll be warehousing
myself this evening.
And there I shall build
a cocoon of many blankets.
Call my gal.
Let her know I survive.
Very worried.
But I will rise again.
I'll tell you that.
I'll be ready and raring
to dive into my new job.
At that point, I'll
drink your tea.
And by then, maybe
just... just maybe
I'll have forgiven you for
just calling me a pussy.
Right?
Boy.
Hello there.
You're right.
You're right.
You're sleeping.
My fault. You got it.
Dick move!
Dick move!
You're...
You're his enabler.
Hello.
That's the walk of shame.
So, this is where the
magic happens?
If, smashing your head
against the screen is magic,
then yes.
What you got so far?
You have one of those
drawers in your kitchen full
of unrelated items, like,
the small appliance manuals,
dead batteries, egg beaters,
how he lost his virginity,
his go-to joke, his theories on
why Thursday was the greatest
day, and everything else
that I can't forget.
In no apparent order.
Nothing stinks like a pile
of unpublished writing.
Quote Sylvia Plath before
preheating herself to 350.
Yeah, well, enter the dragon.
So I guess we can,
start with my notes.
It's kind of like a
book without any verbs.
Yeah, sure.
But what about his notes?
You know, did he keep a journal,
song ideas, things like that?
No, it was mostly in his head.
I do have the last
interview he did.
Yeah, Hannah, look, I'm
all for diving right in.
But I can't start thinking
about the beginning of the story
without knowing
how it... you know.
Right.
He should've been home by then.
His cell kept
going to voice-mail.
So I thought he must
be still up there.
There's no reception
up there on Tumbledown.
It got dark.
And I drove the roads,
looking for him pulled
off with a flat
tire or having hit
a deer... worst case scenario.
And then I saw his
truck at the trailhead.
And later, they
went up the mountain
with flashlights and dogs.
And... in the middle of the
night, in a shallow ravine,
they found him.
He was rock climbing?
Hiking.
Had he never been
on that trail before?
Nope, he'd done it 100 times
in the same pair of boots
that I got him our first
Christmas in Maine.
You know, sometimes you
make a little mistake.
You bump your
knee, get a bruise.
Other times, you make
a little mistake,
and you fall off the
face of a mountain.
I'm so sorry.
It's the least interesting
thing about him.
Can we work on his life now?
Yes, yeah, of course.
But you know, I... I really think
I should go up there sometime.
Why?
To satisfy your
morbid curiosity?
Sure, I mean maybe my dad
will take you up there.
That is if you get to meet them.
Maybe at Easter or something.
Will they be joining me in the
guest room for spring break?
No.
They live in town.
They do a big
Easter dinner thing.
It's a... Yeah, don't worry.
You're totally off the hook.
What are you talking about?
I earned my master's
in American Studies.
Family gatherings are
my bread and butter.
I just... this, the thing
I was talking about earlier.
It's on the, just...
Thank you.
Ok.
Of a friend.
How know who I was then.
How know who I am now.
Love take away how we need it.
Salvation's pain glory be.
Follow me down on this road.
One more hand to lay gold.
Hey, dude.
You know, this
thing's out of tune.
Yeah.
It sat by the fire
too long, probably.
That'll do it.
Plus I'm playing it left-handed
and don't know what I'm doing.
There's that, too.
-Those three things...
-Definitely.
Add up to what
you're hearing.
I'm going into town
to interview this,
Yeah, I'll be back soon.
Is someone the new owner?
I'll come with.
No, no, not that.
I, work freelance
for a local paper
and write these little
community portrait things.
That is very sweet.
Ok.
I'm late.
Work hard.
Ok.
So tell me what you
ate for your birthday.
The Lord's largest whoopie
pie with 88 candles on it.
And I blew out those
puppies all by myself.
Are you going to tell
me what you wished for?
Can't do that, Hannah.
Hey.
It's called investigative
journalism, guys.
Ok?
Your mom's paying to do this.
All right?
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Right!
Have fun, all right?
And consider what I
said about Jessie's kid.
Kenny Roy... he's one
big hunk of manchild.
Keep it in your pants, sister.
Shush.
This is my interview.
Happy birthday, my dear.
Yeah, Hannah, you want
to know what I wish for?
Off the record.
Not if it's going
to break the rules.
No, there are no rules
to it, sweetheart.
I wish to keep living
in the present,
to die just as happy as I
was at my birthday party, ad
to be reincarnated as
my granddaughter's cat.
Next Friday's paper, Esther.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Hey, hey, hey!
Back inside!
Back inside... No, please.
Are you kidding me?
Hey!
Guys, guys, guys, come here!
No, no, no!
Look it!
You...!
What do you think?
It's freezing cold.
Hey, hey, you're back.
I didn't see,
see you get here.
Hey, what's everybody doing
out here in a state of undress?
I'll give you two guesses.
-You didn't...
-Yeah.
Yes I did.
No, I, took them
on a walk and locked
all the doors by instinct.
Yeah, very primal.
Our Neanderthal
cousins were constantly
locking themselves out.
Yeah.
This is one wet t-shirt contest
I don't know want to win.
I'll get a fire going.
Wow, you're still freezing?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hunter was prone
to the bone chill,
too, if he wasn't
wearing his long johns.
I mean he wore two pairs
the day we got married.
Well, you know,
special occasional and all.
We had a whole spring
wedding planned.
You know, daffodils
were just coming up,
and days were getting longer,
and a foot of snow the day
before we were
supposed to get married
in my parents' backyard.
So Hunter says,
come one, Buttercup.
Put your snow shoes on.
And we clamber up and say our
vows on top of Bald Mountain.
Hunt said whole
world was wearing
a wedding dress that day.
The man was a poet.
I'd been made redundant, so
I decided to wear magenta.
Plus you would
have been camouflaged, right?
Hannah, do you take this
man to be your... Wait.
Hannah?
Hannah, are you there?
I don't see you.
Hannah, are you there?
I can't see you.
Hannah, you all right?
Hey Curtis.
What are you...
What's going on?
The whole county's gone black.
Right.
Well, great timing.
Looks like we're
going to have to ride
this one out till morning.
God, you are wicked pretty
with your hair...!
Who are you, if you
don't mind my barging in?
This is my friend,
Andrew McCabe.
We were at college together.
And he's just... This is Curtis.
He provides light for
western Maine, and...
Yeah?
Yeah.
And single-handedly keeps the
deer population under control.
Well...
Yeah, you make
deer condoms?
Ha, kidding.
Hey, speak of the devil.
Got some venison
from the deep freeze.
Looks like I thawed out a
bit more than I could chew.
Curtis,
that's... that's sweet.
Here, let me take it
from you and get... Ok.
There we go.
I'll, cook it up tonight.
You want... you want to stay?
What?
Hannah, no.
I, I wouldn't
want to interrupt
you and your old friend catching
up on whatever, et cetera.
So, that's a good thing about
being a hunter, Andy, is
that even when the
gatherers are up a creek
because they realize they
haven't put away enough nuts
and seeds to lat a
winter, a hunter,
he can find himself
dinner any day of the week
as long as he can sniff out the
right dung, keep a steady shot.
Yeah, boy, I hear
you loud and clear.
Couldn't agree more.
I dont' think I can get on
in the city without my Glock.
You know, when things
get really nasty,
and I haven't been able to
gather up enough takeout menus,
I just head up to the
park, blow up a beaver.
Which I'd probably go
for the raccoon first.
Yeah?
Why's that?
More white meat.
Yeah, good tip.
Appreciate that.
So Curt, what do you,
do for fun up here?
Is it, too
cold for ice cream?
That's all right, Hannie.
I...
Sure I'll be up licking
the crack of dawn tomorrow.
But it sure was nice
meeting your smartass buddy.
I look forward to
our next rendezvous.
Hey.
Hey.
Sometime we should, we
should get dinner in a dump.
That's
very neighborly of you
to, check in on me.
I will, see
you sometime?
What?
Wh... I didn't say anything.
What do you... What are you...
What are you talking about?
Aw, come on.
I did what?
It's very rare for me to get
to dine with the execution
and its executioner.
That's all.
No, you don't know me well
enough to bust my chops.
Here.
What?
Here, come on.
Get over there unless
you want to die of cold.
No, no thank you.
Honestly, I think it's great.
No, seriously though.
I think it's good.
I think it's a good
thing for you to be
getting back on that horse.
And that guy... boy.
What a thoroughbred.
Hold on, young lady.
You, you might
be falling in love again.
Good for you.
I've known him
since high school.
And he's awesome in bed.
And that's all he is.
Wow.
Never had any intention of,
hearing you say those words.
There they are.
Hey.
But seriously...
What?
If I freeze to death...
I just want you
to know this is...
This is some of the
weirdest shit I've
ever dealt with in my life.
You're welcome.
Good night.
No, It's
actually pretty nice out.
Well, it's Easter,
so I assume we'll
be beheading the sacrificial
lamb before dinner, right?
Ok.
Hold on a sec.
What?
You know, you really
don't have to do this.
Why don't you just
take the truck home.
And there's a nice
bottle of Macallan
under the kitchen sink.
No, no, no, no.
I'm solid as a rock.
Yeah, and hungry.
This is going to be great.
Great.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right?
Hey hon, we're here, so I
should really get rolling.
Yeah.
No, I'm, curious
what I can discover
from the rest of the flock.
Hello?
Hi!
Happy Easter!
Hello!
Hey!
It smells good.
-The gang's all here.
-Hi.
Hey, hey.
Hey, you grew a beard?
Incoming.
My God.
Where did you get that?
Fresh fruit!
Be still my heart.
Yeah, I caught it, Mom,
in my world wide web.
Dad, can you, do
me a favor and just,
set another place?
I brought a friend along.
What... what?
You couldn't tell me?
I hope I have enough food.
-All right, everybody...
-It's fine.
-Pretend to be normal.
-Right.
You know what, better still.
Just... just sit her next to me.
Yeah, actually it's
a... he's a... a he.
Andrew.
Andrew?
He's a friend of a
friend and from L A.
He's doing research on lakefront
property in western Maine.
He's a contractor.
Well, where is he?
Is he incredibly
thin or something?
He's in the car on the phone.
Yeah, that's L A.
So L A. So L A.
No, no, Mom, I'll get the door.
I'll get the door.
No, no, I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Hello.
-Hi.
-I'll get the door.
Welcome.
Come in here.
Hi.
Ho, ha ha.
Hello, how you doing?
Aw.
Hi.
Nice to me you.
I'm... I'm Andrew.
Happy Easter.
No, not Easter.
Passover.
Both?
Well, I'm Linda.
Real estate holder in
the state of Maine.
Great.
My God.
Are you really working
all over the holiday?
Isn't your family sore?
Well, what family?
No, I'm joining yours.
Aw.
It smells great in here.
It's a pleasure having you.
Hey.
Nice to be had.
Cheers!
Cheers!
The gang's all here.
This is my other lovely girl...
Yes.
Shannon.
This is my lovely boy, Seth.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
And this is his
special friend, Megan.
Come on, guys.
Let the man wipe his boots off.
Bruce Jasperson.
Pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
Welcome.
Shannon, will you, give
Andrew a tour of the place.
But don't take him
into my office.
It's very, very messy.
She just says that because
she thinks messy means
creative and spontaneous.
You're so hilarious.
Nice meeting you all.
I'll see you after the,
after the tour.
-Good luck.
-All right, Shannon...
How could not not tell us?
You know how overjoyed I am?
Well, Happy Easter.
Well, how long is he here?
Can he come with
us to the Bogarths'
maple syrup barn party?
Yeah.
And what about Matt
Froh's band is playing.
So all of Farmington
will be there.
Whoa, whoa, Mom, just, you
know, get all the joy that you
want out of him tonight because
after his business is done,
he'll be long gone.
Sweetheart.
There there.
This is our wall of shame.
Yeah?
Yes.
My parents love to
frame the best and worst
thing we've ever done.
Yeah.
It's constantly challenging us.
Yes.
And up for revision.
Wait a minute.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Hannah wrote a book?
Seasonal motifs poem stuff.
It's a very long title.
I can't really...
Plus she gets two
best prizes for some reason.
Yes, like she never
did anything wrong.
P H frigging D.
From Brown.
Couldn't get into Harvard.
Well...
Ha!
And Seth's room is upstairs.
It's sort of creepy.
All right.
Look at this.
Right over here, Andrew.
This is you.
Who needs more sauce?
Everyone good for...
Well, Doctor.
Andrew, right here.
This is you.
Let's all take our seats.
Ahem, here we go.
Smells delicious, Dad.
Let's join paws for a sec here.
We are grateful today
to Mother Nature and Mother
Nurture for the abundant
food on this table
and the not entirely
unattractive family around it.
Amen.
We remember those who
are with us in spirit.
And a special welcome to
our new friend, Andrew.
Thank you.
Well, let's dig in. everybody.
-Enjoy your food, right?
-Right.
Here we go.
-Wow, it looks amazing.
-Amazing.
Days
So Andrew,
what's the insider's
scoop on our lakefront prices?
Do you think Maine's going to
explode like the Boston suburbs
after the crash?
Is Maine going to explode?
Yeah.
I am such as sucker.
I'm 29 and still renting.
So what do you think, Andrew?
Do you think I should buy?
Or is... is the market
still softening?
You know, actually I think
Andrew's specialty is in
commercial real estate, right?
And, who wants to talk
about work over Easter dinner?
I do.
Me.
Yeah, I'd love to.
Talk about it any
time, you know?
Breakfast, lunch,
snack time, dinner.
I mean, I'm a Realtor, you know?
It's my passion.
Ha ha.
How'd you catch the
real estate bug, Andrew?
Are your folks big land holders?
Sure...
Yeah, you ever heard of Wyoming?
Ok.
All right.
All right.
Hold your horses.
I care.
I care.
Yeah, she's curious.
It's all right.
Well actually Mom,
Andrew's research
is for more personal reasons.
He's an associate
professor for American
Studies at Hofstra University.
And he's here researching
a paper about Hunter.
And when I say paper, I
mean more like a biography
that I have hired him to
write with me about Hunter.
Really?
So there's nothing
going on here, you mean?
No.
No, and he has... not that it
matters, he has a girlfriend.
Yeah.
And can we
not talk about this
while he's sitting right here?
Well, fuck-a-doodle-doo.
And here I thought maybe
the clouds were lifting.
You know, Mom, it's not
actually any of your business.
So you're just
eating my manicotti
and happily lying to my face?
Jeez.
Ok, I'm... I'm sorry.
Can we... can we start
again with this, please?
My... my real name
is still Andrew McCabe.
You know, I'm just...
I'm just the help.
I wasn't briefed on
the classified nature
of my employment.
You know, I am really hoping
to interview each and every one
of you, if you're
willing to contribute
to what I believe will be a
very beautiful book someday.
That is unless I just got fired.
My food got cold.
Meatball?
Yes, yes sir, thank you.
There's a
spoon in the bowl.
You're absolutely right.
You're absolutely right.
-No, heap it up.
-No.
You don't
have to do that.
A spoon's a better way to go.
Well, all right.
Need any help?
No.
Well, I wanted to thank
you for including me
in such a delicious
feast, Mrs. Jasperson.
The manicotti was dry.
Well, I gobbled it right up.
You sure did.
Hey, so are you a
fan of Hunter's music?
So what is this?
The interview portion
of the program?
Sorry, but I don't
support the whole project.
Gotcha.
Back to balderdash it is.
Not a problem.
No.
See, it is.
She will never break
this endless cycle
of keeping Hunter around.
Well, you know, maybe
this is her way of ending
that chapter of her life.
Ho, no, no, no.
She does care a great deal
about his legacy, you know.
His legacy is 12 songs.
Does the world care that much?
You'd be surprised.
Yeah, and what do
you care about?
Is this your golden ticket
to tenure at some school
where there's ivy on the walls?
A fan.
It was my son.
That's what he was to me.
Of... of course.
I'm sorry.
Well, what was he like?
It's kind of hard to tell from
just listening to the music.
There was darkness in the man,
but he was one of a kind.
And she felt lucky to
be considered his equal.
Well, Hannah's a pretty
smart cookie herself.
Yeah, you think so?
I know so.
But she can't think her
way out of this one.
What is in here?
Boy.
Ok.
Who knows?
This is heavy.
All right.
All right, that was interesting.
Hey.
I got a question for you.
No, that wasn't my real mother.
Here.
Your prize for
lying to my folks.
Not that you were
very good at it.
Seriously though, like, why
do you want to write this book?
Because I had so much
love left in my arsenal,
and I never got to spend it.
'Night.
Hey, Hannah.
I kind of dug your family.
Easy, Carl Lewis.
What are you doing?
Holy smokes.
Watch the ice here.
What ice?
Kidding, Bruce.
Those are jokes.
I thought you invited
me over for French toast.
What's in with the bag o' peat?
I thought as long as the
boys are having their fun,
we could be productive.
Ok.
You got to
plant the seeds early, honey.
Try thinking more
about the future.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There you go.
Come on.
Jesus, you're quick.
Boy.
All the days I forget
my pedometer?
If we want to
reach the pond up top,
we have to get through
Fat Man's Misery...
Not unlike crawling
up a chimney.
You want the best lookout,
we can hit the Lemon Squeeze
where you make like
a piece of bologna
between slices of toast.
Or we can stop here, eat some
granola, and pay our respects.
Wait, this is it?
It's where they found him.
I always figured probably on his
way down, it was getting dark.
Yeah.
He was out on that
ridge above you there.
Yeah.
Good Lord.
That is no joke.
Got spooked by some animal
jumped out on the trail.
He just lost his footing.
Bruce, we both know he didn't
lose his footing, right?
Wouldn't you say he was
a pretty tortured guy?
Real question for
you here, Andrew...
Who do you think you are?
I studied guys
like him for years.
You know, Hunter's
pretty textbook.
If... if you really, really
listen to him... like it hasn't
occurred to anyone, right?
Yeah, it never occurred to us.
So thank you, wise one from
the island of tall buildings,
for the teaching us
native folk how it is.
Now, you just have
to nurture them?
Like they're your own children.
Smooth segue to my ovaries.
Listen.
Every year presents a milestone.
Knocking out your baby teeth,
graduating, heavy petting.
Ew.
When you're old,
there are only two milestones
left... grandchildren and death.
And you just pray that one
comes before the other.
I know.
I know I'm impatient, but I've
tasted all the juicy stuff
except this one thing.
You know, Mom, I used to
think that I wanted children.
Now I just want llamas.
So many llamas.
Just take one step.
Yeah, do a date on the
internet and cut this hair.
Jesus.
Just take a break from this
morbid writing project.
Wow.
Cue the salt in the wound.
Hey, it's time to call
up your old friends,
lipstick and the eyeliner.
These are like raw eggplant.
Ok.
Three strikes, I'm out.
You need a little perking up.
No, I do
not need anything.
Just a little bit.
Just a smidge.
You're
just going to leave me?
Of course.
Of course.
No, it gets dark at 4:00 PM.
Bedtime.
Who needs coffee?
Like I said, the
gatherers always get screwed.
Howdy, Curt.
You here to discuss the food
chain a little bit more?
How's it go?
She's a real Maine
girl, that Hannah.
You're telling me.
She likes a good man.
A real man.
A man that smells like pine
resin, not Pierre Cardin.
I've got no
claim on her, Curtis.
Hell, if you guys procreate, it
might even out the gene pool,
yeah?
Really nice seeing you.
My God.
Are we going to
do this bullshit?
What are you going to do?
Kick my ass?
Not saying that you couldn't.
You'd destroy me.
There's not a soul in this
town that wants to see her going
with a flatlander like you.
You're going to crawl back
into that exhaust hole
you came from.
All right, Curtis.
Curtis Brown.
We live in the slow
lane, not a gravel ditch.
Where are your manners?
Andy?
Go screw yourself.
Please and thank you.
Aw, come on.
You all right?
Yeah.
No, I'm fine.
Just helping everybody
work through their issues.
He didn't pee on you.
No, surprisingly, no.
He did not pee on me.
No, I didn't even know
that would be an option.
No, he just threw
down the gauntlet.
That's, kind of sweet.
No, it is not sweet.
No.
Come on!
What are you talking about?
This isn't quaint or
kooky small-town charm.
You know, and I got
to be honest with you.
I am sick of the forest and
all the crazy little creatures
who live in it.
You drag me up here to
write thie book with...
Ok Snow White.
Nobody is holding you hostage.
You leave in two days, right?
You can leave tomorrow.
My God!
Can you just be a chick
for like a second and say,
there, there, poor thing?
Or some shit?
Please?
Some shit.
Thank you.
Was that so hard?
Now, I don't know about you, but
I would kill for a overpriced
meal at a mediocre restaurant.
Shall we?
Dinner in a dump.
Purely for
journalistic reasons,
I will choose dinner in a dump.
Excellent.
I've got to see what
this is all about.
Let's do it.
There we go.
Hubba bubba, look at that.
We have a gusher.
I can't believe
we go out to eat,
and you order the
one thing on the menu
that anyone could make
with their eyes shut.
You know, people who can't
toast Eggos can boil a bug.
What are you talking about?
Someone had to cut this
lemon wedge right here.
They had to melt the butter.
It's a lot of stuff involved.
Man, man.
Look at that.
Are you ever getting the
eye from the woodchucks
at the bar over there.
Hi.
Me or her?
You see, around here, everybody
keeps tabs on everyone else.
And everyone else is really
sure I ought to be moving on.
You never, thought
about moving to New York?
Manhattan?
No?
Living in the big city?
A change of scenery might help.
No.
It's not the kind of thing that
you can take a vacation from.
It's who I am now.
I mean you try to
seem normal, right?
But here's the thing that
looms so large in your life,
you can't even see around it.
You know, you can't dress
yourself because it's
blocking your closet.
I guess you could technically
say that I'm... I'm depressed.
No, no, you are not depressed.
That is not depression.
That is just flat out
certified grief, you know?
That's normal.
That's natural.
I mean it's not like
you're waking up at noon
or Skyping with your
therapist during office hours,
like me and half
my colleague do.
What have you got to
be so depressed about?
-Are you serious?
-Yes.
Me?
Tons of stuff.
I do.
I mean little things,
you know, like having
a bunch of smartass
students that
don't have a single, original
thought in their head.
That's depressing.
Big things... my dad
passed away way too early.
That's tough, you know?
I mean the smallest thing
can set me off with that.
You know, like the fall
of light through a window
or a stack of old newspapers.
That's true, though.
But you know, my old man took
his life when I was a kid.
You know, so... Now
there, that's a guy you
though you knew, but surprise.
Do they do free
refills on booze here?
Or how does that work?
That's terrible.
Yeah, yes, it was terrible.
Yeah.
It was a long time ago.
And that's what serotonin
reuptake inhibitors
are for anyway, right?
You're medicated?
Not currently, no.
But a couple more weeks up
here, and I may have call
my dealer... I mean doctor.
What's
going on, boss?
Nothing.
Just, you know,
talking about stuff.
Hannah, care to join
me on the dance floor?
Of course.
Great.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Go scoot your boots.
Five... five songs?
Five hours.
Five minutes.
Ok.
I mean I've spent my entire
adult life in the city, ok?
I've sat front
row at the Garden.
I... I've dined at
some vary hip spots.
I mean, I done seen
some crazy shit, ok?
But this is what Saturday
night is all about.
Yeah.
For some of us, it is.
That's great.
That's great.
Isn't it weird?
You spend your life trying
not to die some way or other,
and then when something
really terrible happens,
you just wish it were
you and not them.
Yeah, well, I'm
glad it wasn't you.
Right, there's no way that
you would pay your $40 grand
to write my biography.
I'm pretty sure
it was $50 grand.
Don't look at me like that.
Yeah.
I mean he's a lot
closer now, isn't he?
-Stay calm.
-Can we go?
Put it in
reverse and leave.
Yeah, that's what I was doing.
Wait, you took out the
whole rental insurance, right?
No, I'm not
too worried about it.
I'm sure those scratches will,
you know, just buff right out.
Are
you done for the night?
No, I mean
no, not if you're not.
Ok.
Come on.
We're getting out.
All right.
What were you thinking?
Ta da.
There's more.
Come on.
Where the hell
are you taking me?
You'll see.
There may well
be a raccoon in here,
so brace yourself.
Here, wait, let
me just get this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
God, it's freezing in here.
-This is amazing.
-I'll put the heater on.
Yeah.
Whoa.
This is... I... I can't
believe th... I mean this is...
This is what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
This is the guy we
all want to know.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Look at all this.
I
Can't believe this.
Boy boy.
This is incredible.
I...
Hey, Hannah, thank you.
Thank you for letting me in.
I'll erase your brain later.
Agreed
Agreed, yes, absolutely.
Yeah.
-May I?
-Sure, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.
Yeah?
Boy.
The... Yeah.
Analog, of course.
Wait, wait.
These aren't...
God, no.
Those babies are in
a safety deposit box.
That's just,
antique blank canvas.
Yeah.
Man.
Yes.
Now we're talking.
Vinyl collection of
the gods, you know?
Great.
Love it.
Yeah, well, you know,
he had his muses.
Don't we all?
This is really good.
Hilarious.
I haven't seen on
of these in a while.
What is that?
It's a four-track.
It's still plugged
in and everything.
Wait.
Don't... don't...
You, me,
and the trees shall know.
Maybe in the cold, cold snow.
Like
going away to go.
I'm a pebble on
the pond of life.
Wait.
What are you doing?
No, I... I... I... don't...
Can you go back to the house?
What song is that?
I... I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you mean,
you don't know?
-How...
-I don't know.
Can you go back to
the house, please?
Yeah.
Son of a bitch.
Ok, no running out of
breath this... this time.
Here we go.
Way up Little Jackson.
There's a split in the stone.
Where I lose myself to time.
Is there more than
flesh and bone?
Standing in the cold, cold snow
Only you, me, and the trees
shall know.
Maybe in the cold, cold
snow It gets low way to go.
What is it?
Is it a whole album?
I... is it any good?
Yeah, I mean
there's a... there's a song.
And I mean... I don't know.
There's like one
song, at least one.
Or a part of one.
But she definitely
knew nothing about it.
And you don't get to hear it?
I have no idea.
I mean she could be ripping
it to shreds as we speak.
This track may never
see the light of day.
All I know is there was
a ghost in that room.
Hello?
Andrew?
What's going on?
Hi.
Hey!
Finley.
Is everything ok?
Yeah.
I hopped on the
6:00 AM to Portland.
Don't know what
happened, but somehow
-the cab ended up being...
-Stay.
Stay.
-$248.
-Stay!
I definitely only
had enough money for tip.
-Crazy expensive, Maine.
-Right.
Yeah.
So good to see you.
That's incre... Hannah.
This is Finley.
Right here, in the flesh.
Finley.
I'll...
I'll... I'll go grab
my wallet and get cash for her.
How are you, Hannah?
My gosh.
I've heard so much about you.
He adores you.
And as a person in
the music industry,
I just want to say that we
all grieve the sudden loss
of your husband.
You,too.
I... I mean, thank you.
I mean.
I'm sorry to barge
in on you like this.
I just didn't know how good
you were at keeping secrets.
Terrible.
You shouldn't tell me anything.
Here it is.
Got it.
$100.
I'll leave you two to...
All right, yeah.
She's cute.
Yeah, no, I guess so.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
Bedroom's right there.
It's, it's so
good to see you.
Not bad?
Can't you imagine a little
cabin up here for a couple
weeks in the summer?
Just reading, and swimming,
and napping, and...
Easy, easy.
Sorry, Papa Smurf's
a little chilly.
Well, why don't we warm him up?
Because I've missed you.
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Shoot, where's she going?
God, do you think she took it?
Way up Little Jackson
there's a split in the stone.
Here I lose myself to time.
Also rend flesh and bone.
Forgive me, baby.
I should have told you.
What can I say?
You were always better at
this than I ever was, anyhow.
I love you, Hannah.
Jeez.
Hey, Hannah, it's, Andrew.
Not sure where you
are, or ended up.
But Finley and I
are going to head
to that maple syrup
barn party thing
that your mom invited us to.
And, well, I hope
you're doing all right.
And I'll see you there, I guess.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, where's Hannah?
She's been AWOL, like all day.
No, we didn't
expect her to show.
I mean it's just,
you know, it's their,
her wedding anniversary.
That was today?
Yeah.
-Fin, honey.
-Hi.
We're going to roll.
I missed you!
Ho.
I want to climb you.
Yeah, we're a
little wild tonight.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
All in... in here!
Whoa!
Hey, Finley.
Happy anniversary.
What did you
think of the song?
I don't... what are you...
What are you talking about?
You forgot to rewind.
It's all right.
I don't blame you.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was beautiful
and incredibly sad.
No.
Not sad.
What do you
think I should do with it?
You're asking me?
Well then, well,
if you love somebody,
set them free, right?
Right.
Sting?
I think that might have
been the Dalai Lama first.
And then Sting played
some incredibly
obscure instrument behind that.
Yeah.
Did he have any idea
how lucky he was?
He was lucky.
Until he was profoundly unlucky.
I know how you feel.
Yeah.
All that concern you
have how and why you lost him.
What?
He doesn't deserve this.
You know?
He couldn't bear the weight,
so he put it all on you.
He traded you for some
poetic notion of immortality.
No.
Andrew, he...
Yeah, it's all in...
In those lyrics.
I mean, lay me in
the snow where I...
Where I lose myself to time.
Is there more than
flesh and bone?
And then at the end, he... I mean
he just... I mean, he tells you.
I mean he's giving up.
So sorry.
All this time, and you've
just been gathering evidence
for some suicide theory.
That's... No, that's
not... that's not true.
Because, well...
Well, whose suicide
are you trying to figure out?
Great.
Ok, psychoanalysis?
We're going to
do a little... Ok,
because... I mean because those
lyrics... If we're honest about
those lyrics, it seems to me...
Andrew, the song means nothing.
How can you say that?
Because I wrote it.
What?
It's a poem.
It's my little jokey poem
about making frostbitten
love on top of Little Jackson.
Hunter set it to music for a
surprise, or I don't know what.
It... Lay me in the snow
doesn't mean bury me.
You're the one who's
obsessed with death.
My Hunter was
obsessed with life.
Go away.
Go upstairs.
Go to New York.
Do you know where
Hunter Miles is buried?
Right here.
Thanks.
Have you ever heard his
song, "Sweet Spring?"
Wow, right?
What's your email?
Muffin8066@outlook.
Outlook
Ok.
Why?
I have a song for you.
Share it around
if... if you like it.
The
truth of the matter
is, I raked it in last year.
Kids would much rather hitch
a ride on a four wheeler
than take the bus.
Coolness factor.
I charge $5.
Marginal profit each
ride, but you get to buzz
around Franklin County all day.
Demand's high,
and chicks dig it.
Feel free to print that.
Well, thank you for the scoop.
Mr. Woodcock.
You know, Ms.
Miles, I don't just
drive around high school
girls, if you...
catch my drift.
All righty, then.
Hannah, hear me out.
I did my best to let go, but
I had to write it anyway...
A couple chapters, at least.
And I think we're
on to something.
Please forgive me for thinking
brilliance comes with torture.
But I'm... I'm not from
your neck of the woods.
Just read it, please...
Right now, actually.
Because I'm... I'm waiting
for you to walk through
the door at Upton's bookstore.
I'll be reading "Anna Karenina."
And if she throws herself
under a train, and you
haven't shown up yet, I'll...
Do you come with peace
pipe, or bearing musket?
Hasn't anyone ever
told you "no" before?
Well, not as frequently or
emphatically as you have, no.
You just dropped a
grenade in my lap.
What do you want me to say?
I... I don't know what
I want you to say.
I just like it when
you say things.
Do you want to go
look at some ice?
Take a walk?
Get out of here?
Yeah, are you kidding me?
Ice?
Frozen water?
It's like my favorite
thing in the whole world.
Eight trillion hits on YouTube.
That ain't bad.
I mean, for your first song.
How pissed is your girlfriend?
I would not know.
I wish you could see
this place in the summer.
Yeah.
Do you hear that sound?
What is that?
A pod of whales communicating?
Lake whales, yes.
I always thought God's
belly after a burrito.
I don't know.
It sounded like a warning.
Just winter crying uncle.
I love living in a place
where you earn your seasons,
you know?
Tough it out.
See the ice return
itself to mud.
Slimy reeds become
hopeful again.
Hannah, do you feel that?
I want to.
Would you mind if I kissed you?
You know, I swam all the
way across this lake once.
In the middle, it feels
like it will never end.
Yeah, but you made it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got back.
Please, let me kiss you.
No.
Look at this.
Here you go.
Yeah.
You smell good.
Hannah, you smell like a desert
in Hawaii, and long winter's...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You ok?
What's wrong?
God!
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's ok, all right?
I get it.
I'm tell you, he doesn't want
you to be a puddle of tears
the rest of you life, ok?
I promise you that, ok?
It's not... It's not
what he would want.
Ok?
You don't get to say that.
Why not?
Because... because it's
a conflict of interest.
How is this supposed to work?
I mean I am competing
with a saint.
What?
His recording studio
is... is... is a shrine.
You know, you've got a
single album on your iPod.
Hannah, there's grief,
and then there is worship.
Yeah, please stop talking.
I totally fell for it.
Fell for what?
I paid you everything
I had left.
Take the money.
I don't care about the money.
I put you up.
Hell, I'm even putting out!
And I'm rescuing you.
Ok, I wrote that book
so you wouldn't have to.
It's just a bunch of words.
It'll never be enough.
I know!
I know.
Hunter was an amazing guy.
He really was.
But all I see is the girl that
he wrote his best songs about.
And I love the shit out of her.
I mean I love her.
But she loves him.
Hannah.
Hello, how are you?
I'm so sorry.
She really appreciated
all those articles
you wrote about her.
We got emails about
it for weeks after.
Well...
Hey.
I hope you
got all your wishes.
You're going to come back
as one awesome kitty.
Do me a favor.
When you see him,
say goodbye for me.
Ethan!
Ethan Woodcock!
By the big!
What are you doing?
Be careful.
Thanks, Woodcock.
So...
