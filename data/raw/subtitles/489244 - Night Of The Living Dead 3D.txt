Who are you calling?
I'm text messaging Mom, telling her
we're gonna be late to the service.
I think she knows that.
Probably over by now.
I'm telling her that we're gonna
meet her at the cemetery.
Or we could turn around
and go back to the city.
"Was Johnny late picking you up?"
But of course, Mom.
Johnny's always to blame,
just like his father.
This'll be a fun afternoon.
-Tell me about it.
I really want to spend my day off
driving a hundred miles to the funeral
of some woman I've seen
maybe twice in the past 10 years.
She's our one and only aunt. -Yeah,
now she's our none and only aunt.
You better be careful
she can't hear you.
Why, is she gonna
rat me out to God?
Can't you find anything
nice to say about her?
At least she never had any kids,
so we don't have to deal
with a bunch of jerk-off cousins.
Why are you being
such an asshole right now?
'Cause I'm sick of getting dragged
into Mom's neurotic shit.
She didn't even like her sister.
All of a sudden, it's, "Oh, my God.
I'll never see her again"?
"Whoa, my family's all gone.
I'm all alone.
What am I gonna do? Whoa."
That's why she needs us there.
No, that's why she needs you there.
I'm sure she'd be just as happy
if I waited in the car.
Okay, this map, it's wrong.
It's not. It's MapQuest.
It's not wrong.
Well, if we were going
to the church,
I guess it would be right.
But since we're so late,
we're going straight to the cemetery.
And it doesn't show how
to go to the cemetery...
You're being a complete girl.
... without first going to the church.
-Figure it out!
Oh, wait. Turn here.
That must be them up there.
Come on.
Where is everybody?
Maybe we missed the whole thing.
Then why isn't the coffin lowered?
And the cars are still down there.
Maybe they decided to wait for us.
Well, where are they, then?
Getting coffee.
-Be serious.
I don't know.
What do you want me
to say, Barb?
Maybe they're trying to creep us out.
Hey, maybe we're being Punk'd.
Did you hear that?
-All right, look.
They've obviously gone someplace.
We better go find the office
and see what's up.
Will you wait a minute?
-No, I won't Barb.
I'm starting to get pissed off here.
Johnny!
-Look...
you can come with me,
or you can stay there.
It's up to you.
Oh, my God! Johnny!
What?
Hey! Let go of me!
Hey! Get off me!
Johnny, wait!
Mom?
Mom?
Help me, please!
For the love of God!
Down!
Miss, you can't be here.
Employees only.
Who- What is-
-As a matter of fact,
you're gonna have to leave
the grounds immediately.
Okay, what is happening?
We have got a situation here today.
If you came to visit
one of your loved ones,
then you're just gonna have
to come back tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
There is a naked man out there
eating a priest.
And there is a room
full of dead bodies in there.
You are really gonna have to leave.
Now, I will take care of all of that.
You won't have to worry about a thing.
-My mother's out there.
My condolences, really.
But now is not the time.
Oh, Mr. Delamo!
Mister Delamo, you-
Leave, Miss, now!
Mr. Delamo, this isn't helping
either one of us.
Oh, God.
This is John's cell.
If you must leave a message, make it short.
John, you fuck.
You fuckin' left me, you bastard.
Just pick up the phone.
Mom is-
She's sick or something,
and there are these...
crazy people or...
maybe they're dead.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, I don't know.
Those two that attacked you,
did they look right to you?
'Cause there were more of them.
They're coming out
of the mortuary, I think.
God, I hope you're all right.
Just pick up the phone.
Okay, I got away,
but I don't know where I am.
I ran. I don't know how far.
But-
Okay, I'm on a dirt road
in the country.
I'm, like, a mile or two
behind the cemetery.
Oh, God. I hope you're all right.
I'm sorry about what I said.
I didn't mean it.
I know you had to get away.
I know you had no other choice.
But you need to come pick me up.
Okay, I'm gonna call 911 right now.
And if you get this,
just please call me back.
Oh, God, Johnny,
I hope you're okay.
Johnny?
Where...
Are you all right?
Who were those guys?
Just go. Go.
I have some friends
that live up the road.
Can you hold on?
-Yeah, just go now.
Here...
take this.
By the way, my name's Ben.
Barb.
Hey, Ben.
-Hey.
What happened?
-Hey, Karen. Where's your dad?
Henry!
So what's wrong with her?
She ran into some-
Look, I don't know.
She just ran into some trouble is all.
Maybe you better leave us alone
while we talk to your dad.
Are you in trouble?
-No, no, no.
I just need to talk to your dad
in private for just a few moments.
Why don't you just go
to your room or something?
Look, I'll tell you about it later.
Come on, you can't shock me.
I live here, remember?
Hey, what's goin' on in here?
Hey, Ben. What's this?
We ran into
some trouble down the road.
Think you can get your progeny here
to leave us alone for a few minutes?
He thinks there's something
I'm too young to know about.
Why don't you let me hear about it first?
-'Cause I wanna know.
Why don't you go back
to the movie?
You're missing the gory climax.
-This sounds better.
Come on, please?
-Go on. I'll tell you about it later.
That's what he said.
So, what's goin' on?
Hi, I'm Henry.
-Hey.
She was attacked by two guys
down the road.
What?
Where?
-About a mile back.
The thing is, these guys
were fucked up, man.
I don't know what they were on,
but they were just-
They were way the fuck out there.
Shit, man. That's bad.
-I know.
I think we ought to call the cops.
Gee, wow.
Shouldn't you make that call
from, like,
wherever all this went down?
'Cause this has got nothin'
to do with us.
They weren't fucked up.
Well... what?
What do you mean?
-They were dead.
Oh, man. Ben, you can't be bringing
this kind of trouble around here, man.
Henry, listen.
Listen to me, okay?
I hit one of them, okay? But they were
on their feet when we left.
No, no.
I mean they were dead.
I mean, they're dead from the start.
They're zombies.
They were zombies.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy,
but you have to believe me.
Oh, that's a good one, Ben.
It's not a joke.
Oh, man. Talk about
pushing the old paranoia button.
I guess that's what friends are for.
She hit her head, okay?
But she really was attacked.
"Hit her head." What are you saying,
I imagined this?
I didn't imagine any of this. There are
zombies coming from the cemetery,
and there are more of them.
There are dozens,
maybe even hundreds.
So we need to call the cops.
And tell them about the zombies?
-Yes.
I don't think that's
such a good idea.
Where's your phone?
Barbara, wait.
What are you doing?
You can't tell the police
you were attacked by zombies.
I'm not crazy.
-Nobody said you were,
but could you come back in the kitchen?
-No!
I'm not crazy.
And I'm not making this up.
The dead are coming back to life.
You have to believe me.
They're coming back to life,
the living dead, to kill us all.
No! No!
No!
No! No! No!
Oh, shit. She's right.
Is she kidding? Is that what
you wouldn't tell me about?
Hey, everybody, this is Barbara.
You met Karen.
And this is Hellie, my old lady.
Hey, Barbara.
And that's Owen.
He's a hired hand.
Hey, are you, like, freaked out
about zombie movies?
You were, like, freaking me out
for a second.
Owen, where's Tommy, Jr.?
The barn. Where else?
Oh, Henry,
is there anything I can do?
No, baby, not yet.
Barbara, could we three
go in the other room and talk?
Can we do that?
Let's- Yeah, okay.
Can I come?
No, Karen.
Stay in here
and enjoy your movie.
What's up with her?
-No idea.
Yeah, come on in the parlor.
Ben's in trouble.
Karen, let's not speculate, okay?
Okay.
It's a great old house, isn't it?
Built in 1897 by the guy
who owned the whole valley.
It's gonna be quite a showplace
when I finish fixing it up.
I've been working on it
for about 20 years now.
Wow.
It's always some big flippin' crisis
that gets in my way.
What are you gonna do, right?
Life is what happens
when you're making other plans.
So, Barbara,
listen, it's not that I don't believe
you got attacked,
but I can see where
it sounds kind of crazy
when you start talking
about zombies.
Ben saw them, too.
Go on, tell him.
Yeah, tell me.
What did you see, Ben?
It was dark outside.
I had my helmet on.
I didn't get a good look.
Did that guy just shoot
the other guy?
I am totally confused.
Who is against who in this flick?
Karen, where are you going?
-To my room.
Don't bother your father. He's in
the middle of something, okay?
I know.
I'm gonna go play Doom.
I don't know.
But I can't say I saw something
that makes no sense.
Thanks. Thanks for the support.
-Hey, Barbara. Come on.
Barb. People call me Barb.
Barb, the truth of the matter is
I don't know what I saw.
Well, can't you smell them? I mean, I can
still smell where they grabbed me.
I'm still hearing that screaming.
They're just watching
the horror channel.
It's creepy.
I don't like creepy stuff.
Baby, nothing's gonna happen.
You're here with me.
Okay, I don't care what this sounds like.
I know what I saw.
And my mom and my brother
are still out there,
and I need to get them help.
-Wait, wait, wait.
You say they were
at the cemetery?
Yeah, they were there
a few hours ago.
Well, I know Junior Tovar.
I mean, he runs
the local mortuary.
Why don't I give him a call and see
what he has to say about all of this?
Junior Tovar?
-Gerald Tovar, Junior?
He's my closest neighbor.
I've got his number.
I mean, if you still want
to go to the cops,
maybe he can back you up,
or go with you.
Is he bald and have a beard
and a carnation?
Yeah, that's Junior.
-Yeah, we met.
And the last time I saw him,
he was dancing with a corpse.
Hey, you watch it, hired hand.
Hired hand.
I could say something, but I won't.
How about this?
I'll take you to the police.
Or the hospital. You need
to get that checked out.
On your motorcycle?
Yeah.
I'm not going through those woods
on your motorcycle.
And why can't we just
call the cops?
Is it because of the weed?
Well, basically, yeah.
Okay, well, we can just
flush the stash.
This is a little more important
than losing your stash.
It's not that simple.
Look, Barbara, you seem
like a smart, cool person.
Can you understand we've got
our own lifestyle here?
We kinda go by our own rules.
We don't like to get involved with the
so-called authorities any more than we have to.
So, can we just
sort of leave it at that?
Are you growing your own?
If I told you that,
I'd have to kill ya.
I'm just kidding.
Look, I'll just drive you in my truck.
Will that satisfy you?
We'll just, you know,
take my big old truck.
It's built zombie tough.
Okay, but we gotta leave now,
because I don't feel safe here.
Look, I better come, too.
How come?
Just in case.
Revenge of the spliff.
You're an idiot.
Movie over?
Yeah, it was a bummer, man.
Everybody died.
Where's Karen?
She went to her room.
Ben and I are gonna
drive Barbara into town.
You gonna talk to the cops?
Sure, why not?
I'm just being a good Samaritan.
It's got nothing to do with us.
So you were just freaked out
about the movie, right?
I mean, you didn't see any, like...
real zombies?
Owen-
'Cause, you know, like, real zombies,
they don't exist.
Except in, like...
maybe in, like, Haiti or something.
Dude, I think you've had
way too much of this.
You're not the dad.
Owen, why don't you go check
the greenhouse and then hit the hay?
We do have some
real work to do tomorrow.
Yes, sir. I'll get right on it.
Don't go outside tonight.
And make sure you
lock the doors after we leave.
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
Owen, tell Tom and Judy
to come back inside, will ya?
Get it off!
Get it off of me!
Get him off!
Oh, my God! You killed-
Jesus Christ in a handbasket!
Help him.
Man, this hurts really bad.
I'm gonna need stitches.
I think he's gonna need a doctor.
The bastard bit me!
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.
Fuckin' stinks, man!
Oh, my God!
Help!
How many are there?
Are the other doors locked?
I don't know!
Hey, get the lights.
You wanna call 911 now?
I wanna know which one of you
motherfuckers slipped me the bad acid.
Tom.
Someone's out there.
Fuck 'em.
There's more of 'em, right?
Henry, what's happening?
They're all around the house.
They gotta be on something.
Yeah, they're on bad acid.
A virus or rabies- I don't know.
You stabbed one through the heart,
and it still kept coming.
I told you where they came from.
They came from the cemetery.
-Right. The living dead.
Would you guys stop
arguing, please?
Are we safe here?
-I would say no.
Henry, you got guns, right?
Guns?
-Yeah.
Yeah. Shit yeah. I've got guns.
Hellie, go upstairs and get Karen.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
This is gonna mess with her head.
Better leave her up in her room.
No, no, no, no, it's better
if we're all together.
Go get her.
-Wait a minute.
They're turning around.
They're going away?
They're going after something.
Oh, shit.
Oh, yeah.
We're busy in here!
I said stay the fuck out!
Karen, that better not be you,
you little perv.
Hey! Didn't you hear me?
Who the fuck is that anyway?
Hey there, Owen.
Enjoying the view?
What the fuck?
Owen?
What the fuck-
Judy, run! Run, Judy!
Get the fuck out!
What are they?
No!
We have to help her.
Where's Tom?
Judy!
No!
Please, no!
Please! Please! Please!
Son of a bitch!
Oh, God. No!
Hey, what the fuck
is happening?
No!
We can still get to Judy now,
while the-
Yeah. Come on.
Hellie, you and Barb stay inside.
Come on!
No! Please!
This is not happening.
Those are not fucking
walking corpses.
Hey, man this is
fucking happening.
Call the frickin' cops!
We have to, baby.
-Yeah, call the cops.
When the dead walk,
you gotta call the cops.
Yeah, yeah.
I know the local deputy.
I'm not supposed to call.
We kind of have
a "don't ask, don't tell" understanding.
But I think since
we're not the problem,
he might be able to keep this
from turning into a goddamn clusterfuck.
What is it?
-Phone's dead.
They must have
cut the phone lines.
They can't a phone line.
They're fucking brain dead.
What about the TV?
Maybe this is already
on the news.
Yeah, come on.
Okay.
Give me that.
Oh, my God.
Whoever cut the phone,
cut the cable, too.
Okay, what about cell phones?
We don't have cell phones.
I don't allow 'em.
What?
-Look, man...
They're dangerous.
They give you cancer.
They can target you
with those things.
That's how they were
gonna get bin Laden.
What about yours?
I don't bring mine
when I come to Henry's.
His house, his rules.
We need to
board up the windows.
No, we need to get out of here.
Henry, where are your guns?
Guns?
Right.
Owen, are you up for
doing a little light labor?
I think so.
-Come on.
Okay, you and Barb knock the books
out of the bookcase,
and use the wood to board up the windows
in case they start breaking in.
Hellie, go upstairs and get Karen.
But don't freak her out!
Guns.
I took these in trade for a quarter key
of Acapulco Gold back in'79.
Yeah.
I never had to fire them
in anger...
but I'm a pretty good shot.
Henry... what the fuck?
What?
-Those are your guns?
You don't have, like, a fucking
machine gun or anything?
Dude, I'm not Scarface,
I'm a man of peace
in what, up until now,
is a pretty peaceful world.
Jesus. Just give me one.
You know how to use it?
-Are you joking?
I grew up on video games.
Oh, can, you take off the belt?
You look like a fuckin'
rodeo clown or something.
Here.
Ben, where are you?
Is Ben down here?
Karen's not in her room.
Well, where is she?
I don't know.
Sweetie?
Kar? Kar bear?
Karen?
Her stereo was playing,
but I couldn't find her anywhere.
Well, did you check
the other rooms?
Of course I did.
Well, where is she?
Karen? Karen?
Karen! Where the fuck are you?
Karen, honey, where are you?
When's the last time
you saw her?
She was watching a movie.
She said she was going to her room
just after the three of you went to talk.
Oh, no!
Karen?
-What's happening?
Karen.
She did not go outside.
No, she didn't.
Karen?
Henry, shoot!
-Shoot it!
Here, give me something
to tie this with.
Some wire or something.
We need to get to the truck.
We can't make it. We have to
stay here until help comes.
We're already frickin'-
We're dead if we stay here.
Whoa, whoa, hey,
what are you doing?
I gotta go find Karen.
Oh, no, you don't.
-Yes, I do.
Barb, hold the door.
Hold the door.
If you go out there, man,
you're gonna die.
Karen's out there, man!
Yeah, well, if she is,
then she's either found
a safe place to hide...
or she's dead, man.
She's my baby,
my own flesh and blood.
Henry, please,
just listen to him.
You're not gonna do Karen any good
if you get yourself killed.
I can't lose her, too.
I know, I know.
She's a smart girl.
She's fine, I just know it.
I gotta-
I gotta lay downstairs.
Now look, I have to do this!
Henry!
Now, you can either help me,
or you can stand back
and let me do what I gotta do.
Get outta my way.
Okay.
If that's what you gotta do.
Henry-Oh!
What are you doing, man?
I'm saving your life.
Ben, can you put
that gun down, please?
Do you want him to go outside?
-No.
Then don't interfere.
We're gonna do this
my way, okay?
Now, we're gonna
get ourselves ready.
Then we're gonna
go get the truck,
and we're gonna get help,
all of us, together.
Everybody except Karen, right?
Dude, she's either safe
or she's dead, man, let's face it.
Yeah, well she will be dead
if we leave her here.
Hey, man, if you wanna
blame me for this, fine.
Or you can blame your own
fuckin' cell phone paranoia.
I don't care!
But what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna make sure
as many of us as possible
get the fuck out of here alive.
Yeah, especially you, right?
Hellie...
do you got any pants Barb can wear
and some good running shoes?
I think so.
Ben, can you please take your finger
off the trigger?
Don't worry. If I do shoot him,
I'll shoot him in his fuckin' foot.
Henry, please don't
do anything, okay?
Don't worry.
Go on, get her some clothes.
Hey, you guys aren't
leaving me, are you?
No, man, we're not
gonna leave you.
How about these?
-As long as I can run in them.
You know, Ben's a good guy.
He would never have shot Henry.
Henry would have gotten
himself killed.
You know, it's all because that kid
had to spy, and-
You know, she's always-
She can never be left out
of anything.
It's probably because she never had
any boundaries growing up.
Where was her mother?
She died six years ago.
A couple years before
I met Henry, actually.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, she was a junkie, so-
You know, I was headed that way, too...
but Henry saved me.
You know, he got me clean.
Except for pot, but-
You know, you gotta have something, right?
It's funny to say.
This was a pretty stable household.
Why is this happening?
I have no idea.
Have you ever read
those Left Behind books?
You know, 'cause I was
starting to think that
maybe this was, like,
the beginning of-
What, the end of the world?
I mean, I really don't believe
in any of that stuff.
But...
when something like this
happens, you gotta think.
You know-
I mean, I always thought of myself
as a good person.
But am I really?
Whatever's doing this,
I don't think it's God.
I just want this to be over with.
You ready to go?
-Yeah.
What's that?
Nothing. I just figured out
how Ben and Henry know each other.
Henry, you know
I love Karen like a sister.
No, Ben.
Don't play that card.
You know that, if you went out there
yelling her name,
and if she was alive
and hiding out there,
she'd call out or come running,
and they'd get her, man.
I'm not a fool, Ben.
I know you're not.
-It's just-
I've lived a lot longer
than you, man.
And I've lost a lot
of people that I loved.
I know. I'm sorry.
They've done it, man.
Shouldn't have done it.
It's just sometime-
Sometime that has to be
the last time, you know?
You shouldn't
have done it, man.
Shouldn't have done it.
Done what?
It was wrong, man.
It was wrong.
It was wrong.
You shouldn't have done it.
Owen? Done what?
Watched that movie, man.
It cursed us.
It's like a premonition.
Owen, that's the stupidest
fucking thing you ever said.
We're in the shit, man.
We're in the shit.
It's the curse of the living dead.
We gotta get him to a doctor.
You know what,
I really gotta pee.
Go on, I'll be right there.
-Okay.
Hey.
Where's Hellie?
-She's in the bathroom.
Oh, Henry!
Oh, no! Oh, God!
Henry! It's Karen!
It's Karen! Karen!
-Karen?
Karen, baby.
-No, Henry don't, please.
Karen?
-No, that's not Karen.
No, Henry!
Put that gun away, God damn it.
-Get out of the way!
Henry, look out!
No, baby. Don't.
Don't.
Does that hurt?
Don't move, Henry.
It's okay.
Come on, Henry.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Henry.
Wake up.
Stay with me Henry, please.
Just stay with me.
Stay with me.
Henry. Henry Cooper.
Henry, are you there?
Open the door, please!
For the love of God.
No!
No!
No! Back!
Get thee behind me.
No. No biting. Henry-
No- Hello, in there. Don't.
No. Stay back. Is that-
Henry!
No. Oh, Mother of God.
Will somebody please let me in?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I genuinely appreciate this.
Junior?
Oh. Hello, Henry.
Oh! Hello, again.
Glad to see you took my advice.
To run away? Yeah.
Y'all mind if I sit down?
You have anything to drink?
Some tea?
Water? Water would be fine.
I'd be happy to get it myself.
Not just yet.
I have some questions first.
Oh? About?
Barb here says these things
are coming out of your mortuary.
Is there any truth to that?
Tell them. I mean, tell me.
What the hell is happening?
They started coming back to life
about two weeks ago.
First, it was just
a twitch here, a twitch there.
I thought it was my mind
playing tricks on me.
And then some of them...
got up and...
started coming...
and coming.
And-
And I knew I couldn't
avoid it anymore.
I had to deal with it.
Are you saying the dead have been
coming out of the ground for two weeks?
Oh, no, no.
No, not out of the ground.
They're not strong enough
to get up out of buried coffins.
As a matter of fact, I don't even
think that most of them
that are in the ground are alive.
At least, I don't like to think so.
Then who are you talking about?
Who's coming back?
The other ones.
The ones...
The ones that were
supposed to be cremated.
Now, you know my daddy
handled all the cremations.
He wanted me to help with it,
but I couldn't help with it.
I tried.
I tried.
I tried to do everything
exactly the way he wanted.
I learned how to do the embalming.
And I got real good at that.
And I always tried to act right
with the families.
I just couldn't stand the fire.
Junior, your dad died
two years ago.
Are you saying you been
storing dead bodies
that were supposed
to be cremated
for two years?
I guess so.
Doesn't seem that long.
Then again,
it seems like forever.
How many bodies
did you not cremate?
I don't know. Hundreds.
And other things, too,
that were supposed to go
into the fire.
What other things?
Parts.
Parts of bodies.
Medical things.
As a matter of fact, I think that's how
this whole thing got started.
You didn't know we were
never licensed, did you?
No, Gerald.
I did not know that.
Well, some people did.
That's how we got
some of our best clients.
They would bring us things that
they wanted us to cremate.
Things that they didn't want
to have to report.
What things?
Left-overs.
Medical left-overs
from experiments and whatnot.
I think if I could have
burned anything,
it would have been them.
Oh, Jesus.
I tried to keep all the medical stuff
sealed up.
But there was definitely
some leakage.
I mean, there always is.
There's nothing you can do to avoid it.
As a matter of fact, I think some of it
got into my embalming tools.
So you're the one
responsible for all of this.
I tried to control them.
I did control them
for almost two weeks.
But then something happened
that I-
I didn't know about.
You see, when they're dead,
dead to begin with,
before they're infected,
well, they come back real slow.
So slow
you don't even notice.
But then when you do notice,
you got time to handle it.
But the other ones,
the other ones
that don't start out dead,
the ones that die
from gettin' bit,
oh, when they come back,
they come back fast.
Real fast.
What are you guys talking about?
I was having a nightmare.
Hey, man. You're back.
How do you feel?
-I don't know.
Kind of hungry.
Whoa. Whoa.
You're freezing cold, man.
Maybe you better
lie back down.
So something-
something happened.
Something bad-
I can't remember.
Whoa. What?
Wait, wait-
-I need.
What are you doing, man?
-I just need-
Whoa. Just lie back down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What-
-No, I need.
What are you doing?
-I just need it.
Lie back down.
You're not thinking straight.
Watch out there, son.
-What?
You don't wanna get bit.
I think your friend there
died a few minutes back.
No way.
That's fuckin' bullshit.
Owen?
Owen, come on, man.
Owen, you're not dead, are you?
-Who's dead?
But he's still talking.
Some of the fresh ones
keep talking for a while.
It's like their mind's
trying to hold on.
Are you?
I feel so cold.
But then they come back real fast.
What the fuck, man?
Don't even think about it.
He's just hurt. He's not dead.
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.
God damn it.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I think we better be getting
to my place.
And how will that help us, Junior?
Well, first of all,
you can start calling me Gerald.
My daddy is dead,
and I am now Gerald Tovar.
Gerald, what's the point
of going back to your house?
Well, they're all
coming down this way.
They follow the living.
You see, it's like they can smell us.
Well, we sure as shit
can smell them.
Look, gettin' to my place
is the first step to gettin' out of this.
You get to my place, we can-
We can use the phone.
We can call the authorities.
Yeah, I think we all should just pile
into Henry's pick-up.
We can break through
and go from there.
We could do that.
That would work.
But what I'm saying is-
How did you know
the phone line is down here?
I saw the line down
when I came in.
Some poor soul just ran
his car into a pole.
We'd best get out of here.
Try not to panic. The keys.
Henry-
-Here.
Give me a gun.
We're gonna barricade
ourselves upstairs.
Wait for you to send help.
Oh, my sweet baby.
Ben?
Go! Go!
Ben? Ben!
Fuck?
-What's wrong?
Nothing. I just wish
I had my jacket.
What?
-Nothing.
Just-
You're a drug dealer.
You're a fucking drug dealer.
I'm not a drug dealer, okay?
Oh, really?
-I'm just putting myself through college.
There's a difference.
What's your major, philosophy?
Oh, my God, this is
so not even the issue right now.
I just think it's funny. That's all.
Zombies versus deadheads.
He supplies the zombies,
and you supply the deadheads.
Hey, who the fuck died
and made you the judge of me?
So I sell a little bit of weed.
But you know what?
If I hadn't been going out there
to buy Henry's bud,
I probably wouldn't have been
on that road to save your ass.
You'd be fucking dead right now.
Well, thank you
for a wonderful evening.
Oh, my God.
You are so full of self-pity
and judgmental bullshit.
You know, a very great man
once said,
"Judge ye not, lest ye be judged."
Well, fuck you, too.
Go away!
I've had enough of you!
I only got one bullet left.
Her loved ones.
They found each other.
I can't believe
they found each other.
They hated each other in life.
Sometimes an act of God
is the only thing that brings
a family together.
Might still work!
Oh, shit. Be my guest.
Oh, I don't mind.
It's only blood.
I think we're gonna make it.
Famous last words.
Come on, think positive.
In a half hour,
we'll be at the cops,
safely surrounded
by guys with guns.
I'm sorry.
It just has to be this way.
Miss?
Be careful.
Stay away from me.
It's not safe in here.
Oh, easy, Papa. Easy.
Easy, Papa.
You don't have to be
afraid of him.
He's as harmless as a baby.
That's your father?
My father, yes.
Papa!
Oh, when he came back,
I knew.
Knew what?
That this was meant to be.
All right, Papa.
Here, here, here.
Blood of life.
Yeah.
Yes. Yeah.
You are fucking psycho!
You don't understand.
I saved them.
My father wanted to burn them.
But I redeemed them from the fire
and gave them life eternal.
Who do you think you are?
You're fucking Jesus?
I did bring them
back from the dead.
Now, that's gotta be something.
Wanna see fire?
I'll show you fire.
I'll burn this place down. I swear.
Now, miss, this isn't doing
either one of us any good.
I'm gonna get out of here.
And you are gonna fuckin' let me.
You put that down.
What, you like fire?
No, Papa!
Hey!
Barbara!
Ben, I'm coming!
Barbara!
Gerald.
Gerald, please.
Please, Gerald,
get me out of here.
Barb. Barbara?
Don't fucking hurt her, man!
Barbara!
Gerald, get me the fuck out of here.
I'll kill you.
What's goin' on?
Gerald! If you touch her,
I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Barbara! Barbara, listen to me.
Now, miss...
I am not going to hurt you.
You're a liar. Why didn't you
just kill us at the house?
I don't kill. I give life.
You were killing zombies all night.
Sometimes what I give
I have to take away.
You're not putting me in there.
You're gonna kill me.
I won't hurt you.
You'll be born again.
Then I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of all of you.
-What's going on?
Gerald, don't hurt her.
No!
-Yes!
Listen to me! Barbara!
No!
Stop!
Stop! Stop it!
Barbara!
Please, let me go.
No! No, stop, no!
Miss, please help.
Gerald? Gerald!
No! I saved you.
I gave you life.
I am the father and the son,
you ungrateful graveyard trash.
Damn you!
I damn you all to hell!
And you, you harlot.
Barb!
Barb, come on.
There's one bullet left.
Barb? -I can't make it out of here.
Look, I can't do that.
I can't do it myself.
I need you to help me.
Please. I need you to...
Hey...
but...
I don't understand.
Barb, am I...
Am I?
I feel...
I feel so... Take it.
No, I can't.
-I need it.
I need you to.
Barb.
