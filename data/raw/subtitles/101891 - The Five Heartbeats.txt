This is J. T., Mr. Jay,
coming at you live from Malibu.
Next, one of the hottest new cuts
going through the airwaves.
(Singing)
(Singing)
(Ends)
All right. That was
contestant number eight,
Baby Doll and the Crystals.
Good show.
jackie, have you seen Eddie?
No, but I know he'll be here.
Let's continue with the show.
Contestant number nine
are from Columbus, Ohio,
and they're going places.
After the show, they're going across
the street for a fried gizzard sandwich.
Lots of hot sauce.
Contestant number nine...
Flash and the Ebony Sparks.
Let's hear it for them.
(Singing)
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
All right, y'all up next.
Good luck.
Right.
Choirboy, would you
sit down someplace?
Damn, you're starting
to make me nervous. Relax.
How can I relax when...
Who's going to sing lead?
Bobby's not here.
He hasn't called. He missed
all the rehearsals this week.
We're on next.
Eddie's not here.
I said I'm gonna talk to them
when they get here, all right?
I don't like singing
in these nasty bars.
You're just nervous because last time we was here,
you got hit in the head with that bottle.
Dresser.
They could've booed or something.
They didn't have to hit me
upside my head with no bottle.
Start calling me little
peanut-head church boy.
All them names and stuff.
Nobody's forcing you.
Where the hell is Bobby?
I fold.
I'll raise you 1 0.
Too rich for my blood.
Easy, Eddie.
I think you guys
have been cheating.
I'm sorry.
(Continues)
(Continues)
Eddie! I'm going
to kill you, Eddie!
Aah! My fuckin' leg!
Get up!
I'll get you!
Nobody's ever cheated me!
(Continues)
Stop it!
I don't understand you.
You say you love me,
but you never call.
Then you bring me up here
and try to screw me in a closet
like I'm a whore or something.
Stop it right there.
I brought you here because
I thought you were a woman,
not some little girl
afraid of life.
I'm not looking
for some cheap thrill
or some stolen moment.
I want to take you
to another level,
living out the chapter
from the most romantic novel.
I want you and I to walk
to the edge of erotica.
(Unzips Zipper)
(Continues)
Whoa!
Get out of the way,
you stupid son of a bitch!
Hold it, Bobby!
You're not going nowhere!
Oh, God!
Shit!
My other leg!
(Gunshots)
Hey.
(Singing)
Duck, listen to me, man.
Bobby ain't here.
You're gonna have to sing his part.
Eddie ain't here either,
but we don't need him.
Bobby's not here?
Why does he keep doing this shit?
He knows I wrote all the music
in fve-part harmony.
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry about it.
Go get your brother.
Oh... oh...
Oh! Oh! Oh!
(Continues)
(Ends)
All right!
All right!
Our fnal act tonight
have been singing together
since high school.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Five Heartbeats.
Let's hear it for them.
Hey, man!
(Singing)
Where's Bobby?
Let's go for it.
(Continues)
Take it,J.T. Take it.
(Continues)
Dresser, take the bass line.
Bass. Bass.
(Continues)
Choirboy, go to church.
Go to church!
Go to church!
(Continues)
(Ends)
That's... That's our cousins.
Our cousins.
Our cousins, our cousins.
One more time
for the Five Heartbeats.
Come on, give it up.
Whoo!
Let me get
all the contestants up.
Come on up.
We have a winner.
We have a winner.
We have a winner.
"Flash and the Ebony Sparks"!
Yeah!
My brother would like to meet you.
Why doesn't he come over?
Because he's shy.
Look at his face.
Don't he look shy?
Yeah, but who's that girl
he's sitting with?
That's our sister.
See? Look how shy he is.
So can I get your phone number
so he can call you sometime?
OK. 5 5 5...
Excuse me. I don't mean
to disturb anybody,
but my name is Jimmy Potter.
I just want to say
I really enjoyed the show tonight.
I especially liked that opening.
Shy brother works every time.
You looked like you
were running for your life.
I don't quite know
where to begin this,
but I was wondering
if you fellas could
use a good manager.
See, I've managed
a lot of groups.
I think you guys
have what it takes
to go all the way to the top.
Now, you don't have
to sign anything.
Your word and your handshake
are good enough for me.
If you give me just one month,
I guarantee
when you come back,
you'll win that talent contest.
Yeah? And if you don't win,
I'll give you the $1 00.
Man, I like them odds.
Well, then,
you just think about it.
And if you're ready,
I mean really ready,
you be at my house tomorrow night
at 7:00, all right?
Mr. Potter,
Eddie's supposed to be here.
I don't know where he at.
Stop apologizing for him,
Dresser.
Sit down. Call meJimmy.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, next week,
we will work on posture
and also each individual
makeup base, OK?
I promise you, next week
is going to be more fun.
Okeydoke.
Bye-bye.
Hi.
Hi.
Come on, Tanya.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Mr. Potter.
Bye, Tanya.
jimmy, may I see you
for a second, please?
jimmy, why are you doing this
to yourself again?
Eleanor,
I know what I'm doing, OK?
(Horn Honks)
Tanya.
(Singing)
(Ends)
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
You know what's wrong.
I thought we agreed that
you would not do this.
I have such a good feeling
about these kids.
Aw, Jimmy,
you had such a good feeling
about the Brownsville Boys.
You had a great feeling
about the Four Clovers.
Great feeling about the Esquires.
And when they made it big,
what happened?
What happened?
They left you.
They left us.
They almost destroyed you.
They almost destroyed
our marriage.
I'm not going to
let that happen again.
All that other stuff
is behind us.
All I'm asking is
for you to believe in me,
just one last time.
This group coming up now...
you've seen them before.
The Five Heartbeats!
Come on.
Let's hear it for them!
80...
and $1 00.
That ain't right,
taking Mr. Potter's money.
Give it back.
Nah. Nah.
A deal's a deal, Dresser.
This is business.
jimmy, I told you
this was going to happen.
Let's get out of here.
Good show, fellas.
Good show.
I got some good news.
The owner of the club wants
to sign you to a contract.
Contract?
The owner?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I think you might
have to take that up
with our new manager.
Yeah, that's right.
We'll be talking to you, man.
All right.
Oh, Jimmy.
Baby Doll.
Baby Doll!
Hi.
Hey.
It's happening, babe.
It's really happening.
Winning!
Hey, how you doing?
Where you been...
coming back here this late?
I told you
he had a show tonight.
How'd it go?
Good.
He ain't gonna be shit neither.
He didn't say nothin'.
He ain't gotta say nothin'.
You ain't gonna be shit,
'cause I ain't shit.
Hmm?
Why you talk like that?
You act like you don't
even care for the boy.
Stella...
I care about that boy.
I just want him to be
a better man than me.
All right. Let me have
everybody in here.
Come on, Heartbeats,
let's go.
Gentlemen,
I got somebody
I want you to meet.
Sergeant ErnestJohnson...
one of my oldest and fnest
buddies from the army.
He's here to help us
with the choreography.
What are you
talking about, Jim?
I do the choreography, man.
Dresser, he's not here
to take your place.
He's here to just help out.
What can he teach me?
(Belch)
If you didn't like
what I was doing,
you could've come
and talk to me
instead of going behind my back,
bringing in some old drunk.
Stop right there!
Don't let your mouth
get you into something
your ass can't get you out of.
Anyway, let me see
your best combination.
Huh?
Huh, my ass. Let me see
your best combination.
Show him, Dresser.
Show him your stuff.
Ha ha ha.
All right, all right.
Cat, Daddy.
Ha ha ha.
just as I thought.
That ain't shit.
Hold my cane.
Hold my cane.
Now pay attention,
and you might learn something.
Damn.
(Sarge) All right, Girl Scouts,
let me see you move.
Smooth hands.
That's what I want to see.
All right. Smooth. Yeah!
Damn.
We're not going to win
that talent contest
with lazy legs.
OK.
And turn!
All right. Let's move.
Pretty hands, now... everything!
Them chumps can't beat us, boss.
That's not the question.
Tonight could be our big break.
I don't want to chance it.
We don't have nothing
to worry about.
My cousin loves us,
and tonight he's the M.C.
Yeah, that's right.
So you talk to your cousin.
Cookie, I want you
to bring some of your
girlfriends tonight.
You know what to do.
Cool.
This is amateur night.
We now continue our show,
and the next group is
a very, very exciting group.
Bird and the Midnight Falcons.
Please.
(Singing)
- Bird!
- Bird!
Listen, we got nothing
to worry about.
The group that's
on now... they're good,
but they don't stand
a chance with us.
That's what I want to hear.
Fellas, you guys are on next,
and, uh, we have one
new house policy.
The house piano player plays
for all the groups.
We didn't rehearse
with anybody.
He doesn't know the song.
Duck, I'll take care of it.
Now, come here, buddy.
Our piano player is going to play.
Let me talk to the manager, because my
boys have worked long and hard for this.
They've come too far
to get hit by some house rule...
Get off my back!
I didn't make the house rules!
We can either deal with this
or walk.
Man, we couldn't
prove nothing by walking.
This ain't fair.
(Continues)
(Continues)
(Ends)
Bird and the Midnight Falcons.
Now, folks,
this next group coming on
told me they are better
than Bird and the Midnight Falcons
and the Temptations
all put together.
- Boo!
- Boo!
I know. I know. I know.
But we shall see.
Ladies and gentlemen,
a nice round of applause for...
the Five Heartbeats.
- Boo!
- Boo!
- Boo!
- Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
(Singing)
Pick it up.
He ain't nobody!
(Pianist Plays Sour Notes)
Go home!
(Continues)
All right, step aside.
Nobody's allowed onstage
during a performance.
You get out of my way.
Are you deaf or just dumb?
You heard the man.
Hold my cane.
Step outside. I'll kick both of you's
ass like you stole somethin'.
Now, come on, Sarge.
It ain't worth it.
Come on, Duck.
Do the steps with me.
No,J.T.
It's my music.
It's my music.
- Boo!
- Boo!
(Pianist Plays Sour Notes)
(Continues)
Get down!
Come on, Eddie!
Sing the song, boy!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Duck, y'all, let's do it
like we did in the tunnel.
(Continues)
(Ends)
(Singing)
(Ends)
j.T., let's do shy brother.

4:00.
Yeah, all right. I can do it.
Congratulations, guys.
The show was on the money.
- Thanks, man.
- Oh, man, thanks.
Thanks.
Girl Scouts...
great show.
Dresser.
Thanks, Sarge.
I got to go now.
How do you fgure
an old man like that
gets that kind of action?
Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt,
but my boss wants to meet you guys.
This is Mr. Big Red Davis
of Big Red Records.
Whoa, jeez,
what do you guys don't do?
I loved the show.
I mean, I really enjoyed
your showmanship
and your style.
I want you on my label.
Let's make a deal right now.
I'm just an old country boy
with a small, little company,
but I do work hard
for my artists.
Here's my card.
Big Red.
jimmy!
It has been a long time.
Yeah, it sure has.
Eleanor, tu es plus
belle quejamais.
These are my boys.
Really?
Well, you call me when you start
looking for a record company.
Congratulations again, y'all.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
jimmy has the most
wonderful surprise.
jimmy, Jimmy,
tell them about the surprise.
All right, all right.
This coming Saturday,
we're going to go
into the studio
and record our frst single.
What?
- Yay!
- Yeah!
Oh, I got nothing
but love for you guys.
Goodbye, Mrs. Potter.
Let's do shy brother...
now.
All right. Be shy.
OK.
Hi.
Hi.
That's my baby brother over there.
Yeah. He's kind of cute.
I'm kind of having
a bad time tonight
'cause I have to baby-sit him.
He can't dance,
don't know how to talk to women.
He's a virgin.
Look at that dumb little look
on his face.
Now that you mention it,
he does look stupid.
So why don't we get out of here?
Let's go do something.
Anything.
You reading my mind, baby.
Work it,J.T. Work it!
(Singing)
Thanks.
(Continues)
j.T.?
I tricked you.
(Ends)
I got to fght every night
to prove my love!
What you doing with my woman?
I'm not doing nothing!
(Yelling)
(Singing)
I'm starting to get it.
Duck, I'm trying to
clean up this room.
I'm trying to write a song.
All right,
but if this room isn't clean
by the time
Mama and Daddy get home,
somebody's going
to be in big trouble.
If this song isn't
written by Saturday,
I'm going to be in trouble.
You know, I don't see
what's so hard.
All you got to do
is combine this part
with this part.
(Singing)
Shh. Shh.
(Continues)
(Both Continue)
(Both Continue)
Chorus.
Dance break!
(Continues)
(Ends)
I want to sign you guys.
Huh? I mean,
I love this record.
I mean, it is hot.
l-l-It's the sound.
You know, the sound.
It... ohh, you guys
are geniuses.
You're brilliant.
But I got one little problem.
l... I don't think this song
is right for this group,
but I got a group
I think would be perfect
for this song.
Hold on a second.
Marsha, send in
the Five Horsemen.
You're going to love these guys.
They're great.
Let's show them who
the Horsemen are, guys.
Yeah, we got soul.
Hit it.
(Singing)
(Ends)
Contract looks OK.
Good. Good.
What about publishing?
Ha ha ha ha ha.
jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, yeah.
That's good.
Yeah, all right, publishing, yeah.
Well, we can talk about it.
And this number of options.
You know the business, Jimmy.
I'm sure your contract
with these boys
is for a long time.
I trust my boys.
What's a fair number
of options for you?
I'd say six one-year options.
Sounds good to me.
I'll have Sheila
change it right away.
Any other changes
your lawyer would make
would probably be minor,
so do we have a deal, Jimmy?
Come on.
We have a deal.
All right.
Yeah! Yeah!
(Singing)
Gentlemen!
(Continues)
Come on, guys, smile.
I love it. I love it.
(Ends)
Yes?
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah.
I'm Duck.
Duck?
Uh...
I'm the one that's been
writing you the poetry.
"We Haven't Finished Yet."
Um...
I think your poetry
is really, really nice,
but I don't think
it's a good idea
for you to come here anymore.
Why?
Oh, you're here.
I'll be right with you.
Excuse me?
Ah, here you go.
No.
It's 7 a.m. Get up.!
This is wild, wild, pretty Rudy
on your favorite radio station
playing thejam
to get you to yourJ-O-B,
brought to you
by Benny Mullin's Barber Shop.
Go get pretty like me. Whoo.!
My hair's fried, dyed,

This week's special,

Also with the special,

Some of you got sick,

knows fiish like Shanea.
Coming up, the Dells, the Four Tops,
but fiirst,
a group with a hot single.
The Five Heartbeats singing
I Got Nothing but Love.
(Singing)
Duck, shut up, man.
Stop trying to sing
everybody's part.
I'm not trying to sing
everybody's part.
That's on the radio.
(Continues)
Our song's on the radio.
Duck! Duck!
Our song's on the radio!
- Aaah!
- Aha aah!
Aaah!
What the hell
is going on in here?
Our song. Our song.
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Our song's on the radio, Mama.
Aah!
(Ends)
(Applause)
Make me proud of you, OK?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm going to say goodbye now
'cause I can't watch you leave.
Well, you know your mother,
how emotional she gets.
Now, listen,
there's going to be
a lot of young gals
on that road.
I want you to put a helmet
on that soldier.
What?
You know, put a tent
on that tree.
Put a hat on your willy.
- Oh. Oh. Use a rubber.
- Oh, a rubber.
OK, OK, I'll see you.
Take care.
Bye, Daddy.
How can I preach the Word of God
and expect them to listen
and my son disobeys me?
How does that look?
Dad, God gave me this voice
in the frst place.
Myra, you know this is wrong.
Anthony, you disappoint me.
You can't serve two masters.
Go on.
Anthony. Anthony.
It's your life.
You've got to experience
different things.
Now, take this.
And I want a gold record,
you hear that?
You better bring me
that gold record.
Thanks, Mom.
Come on.
We should make a left turn here.
No, Sarge, it's a right turn,
then we'll see the Harlem Duke.
The Harlem Duke.
Fellas, I like that name.
Man, we on our way.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Four... Five Heartbeats.
(Singing)
(Ends)
We pray together.
It's just like a family, Dad.
Why don't you believe me, Dad?
That's what you think I am?
That's what I'm going to be,
OK? OK?
j.T., you get lucky
with women, man.
That's what it is.
Not lucky. I'm successful.
The reason I'm successful is
I will do anything to get it.
I play like I'm showing them
my real feelings.
Women love men like that.
I break down and cry
at the drop of a hat.
They go for it every time.
And if she tells somebody
I cried for her,
I just deny it.
(Siren)
Look at me.
Think I have to cry to get some?
Shit.
Duck, what did you do?
I didn't do nothing.
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.
Hands, let me see them.
All right,
everybody get out of the car.
How do I know y'all
a singing group?
Why don't y'all...
sing something?
(Singing)
(Ends)
(Singing)
(Ends)
You see Phil?
See him anywhere?
Oh, here he come.
All right.
Hey, Phil, man!
Hey, look at you, boy.
You guys look great.
New suit?
Feels good
to be out of the city.
Nice bus ride's
just what I needed.
Record's doing real well
on the charts.
We're just about to
release the second cut.
Big Red sends his best.
Yeah, but did he
send the paychecks?
Got them right here.
Tell Red we need some more money.
I'm tired of staying in these sleazy
hotels. Toilets don't even work.
You got the reports
on the record sales?
Got them right here.
What about the album cover?
Yeah, the album cover.
Yeah, I got it.
Well, let's see it.
Now, frst of all,
Big Red really believes
in you guys,
and we decided to change
the cover a little bit
because we see the big picture...
Negroes and white folks
buying this album.
I like that idea.
Let me explain, OK?
Everybody's going to know
who this group is.
We just felt that the picture
wasn't as important
as it was
that we succeed
in crossing over.
I want my boys' picture
back on this album cover!
It's too late.
We'll see about that.
A lot of bull.
Why do we have to cross over?
Why are niggers always crossing
over something, huh?
What's the matter?
They can accept our music
as long as they can't see our faces?
Take it easy on the dude.
It's Big Red's idea.
It's a good one, too.
First we build a strong
crossover audience,
then we can come out strong.
That's bullshit,
and you know it.
Crossover's nothing
but a double-cross.
Once we lose our audience,
we'll never get them back.
Next thing you know,
they try to change our sound.
They'll have us sounding
like white boys.
White boys sound like niggers,
they're the ones
making all the money.
Tell me something, how come
they never cross over to us?
I never seen fve niggers
on Elvis Presley's
album cover.
Let's keep our tempers here.
Now, come on.
This isn't a racial issue.
We all have to look
at the big picture.
Man, fuck the big picture
if they can't accept us
for who we are and what we look like.
Come on.
What are you doing, man?
What are you doing? What...
What you doing in the hallway?
Hmm. Choirboy got a girl
in the room.
Choirboy's got a girl
in the room?
Mm-hmm. Choirboy.
Dresser, where you going?
Uh, I'm going out for a walk.
What's up, man?
You OK?
You been acting strange
ever since we left Cleveland.
I got some things on my mind,
you know.
What things?
She's pregnant.
I don't know what to do.
I love Brenda more than anything
in the world.
You know that, but...
how am I going to raise a kid
on what we make here?
I got to get a job,
so I talked toJim
about leaving the group.
"Don't worry.
Call Big Red."
He... He gave me the number
to this, um...
this doctor who's...
hmm...
Didn't you just get through saying
you love her more
than anything in the world?
Yeah.
Oh, fellas, come on, I can't.
(Applause)
(Singing)
I'm tired of you
wearing my clothes,J.T.,
tired of you using
my toothbrush.
And no more sleeping
in the hallway either.
And I'm tired of you
going in my suitcase.
You wear my clothes, too, Duck.
- I ask frst.
- Shh!
Shut up and sing
and stop acting like a bitch.
Oh, I'm acting like a bitch now?
Yes, you are.
(Continues)
What the hell you doing?
Hey!
Quit clowning around.
(Ends)
Yeah, I just got to
teach them how to...
use everything they do.
I wish you luck.
Yeah.
Everything, onstage and off.
It'll be all right.
Don't worry.
The Heartbeats.
Let's go check them out.
(Singing)
I'm sick of your shit, Duck!
You ripped my jacket.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sick of your shit,J.T.!
If you're not going to do it right,
don't do it at all!
Duck's right now, man.
If we ain't going to
do it right,
let's not do it at all.
Break down!
(Continues)
(Ends)
What color you want?
(Singing)
(Continues)
Open your eyes.
A new house!
(Ends)
