Called you guys

NEWSWOMAN: Officers have been
charged with stealing evidence,
filing false police reports
and extortion.
The New Orleans DA worked
with Internal Affairs
to build their case.
Details are still under wraps
while the investigation
is ongoing.
The DA assures us
that there are
more arrests to come.
Hey.
Can you do any tricks
on that thing?
Hmm?
I didn't steal it
or nothing.
I never said you did.
How long you had it?
A couple years.

- Jamal, get your ass here.
MAN:
Shit, man.
MISSY: Talking to the goddamn police.
Jamal!
Did you not hear me say
get your ass over there?

I was talking to my son.
Jamal, get your ass in the car.
Can you get your ass
over there? Go! Now!

He wasn't doing anything.
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

OFFICER:
Let's move out!
Listen, man.
I will help you
get the camera,
but I am not
gonna kill her.
Well, then look
the other way, Jennings.
That's what you do,
isn't it?
[COMPUTER TRILLS, BEEPS]
