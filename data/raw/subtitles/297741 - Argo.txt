2000 years ago the roman empire
ruled the known world.
In the year of 101 Vincentinus
centurions
ambitions made the Eastern borders
of the empire be covered in blood.
The leader of the Pannonian legion,
decided to raid Decebal,
king of the barbarian Dacians...
The genuine story of the battle
is left to us in his journal.
According to the scroll the Roman
legion ambushed Decebal
and his convoy at the edge
of a forest.
Only few survived the devastating
clash, among them was the centurion
and Decebal.
To conciliate the gods they have
sacrificed the symbol of wisdom,
the Strix Aurum.
According to the legend,
Decebal's robe,
the journal and the altar
is what's left to those
who believe in the existence
of the Golden Owl.
... and during the last 2000 years
there were always believers...
Hawk 1, hawk 1
... ready. I copy. Area clear
... now.
Break
... hawk two
... go, go, go...
Pipe system clear,
alerts deactivated.
40 seconds from now on.
Good Luck.
Shit, where's the third one?
I see only two.
Let me check this. Hawk, continue.
We have the robe.
Target object located,
we've got the robe...
Watch out! Here is the third one!
Let's go!
Milkman speaking, I'm listening
The trails lead to a private museum
in Syria. You have 3 days.
According to the program
the Centurion was called Vincentinus.
His journal is exhibited in a museum
in Budapest, Hungary.
We have reached the last stage.
Just a few days
and you can put on your shelf
something the world
doesn't even know it exists.
Gentlemen, the Strix Aurum exists
and it is in Hungary.
Isn't it interesting?
How long has it been since
you've been home?
It's been quite a while.
But I still have my connections.
I am calling my people in Budapest...
...by the time we get there,
the scroll will be in our hands.
So be it.
Good bye. Closing time.
This way please! Good bye.
- Good bye, Miklós.
- See you on Monday?
I examine candidates.
- See you next week.
- All right, see you.
SYSTEM ACTIVATED.
This says here that the tax rate
of petrol price in Hungary is 70%.
Stupid! Are there still such things?
I don't know. I haven't
been home for 20 years.
In those days there were many
strange things.
That was one of the reasons
why we left.
OK.
The match starts
in half an hour.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
Those cats must be jumping up
and down on the rooftop again.
Just to be on the safe side,
let's check the building
one last time.
You do the First floor,
I'll check the basement.
- We'll meet in front of the telly
in 20 minutes. - Okey, dokey
For fuck's sake Tyson!
It's the second time!
Shut up! I tell you
when you can talk!
You two make such noise even
the deaf porter heard you!
You shut up, too!
- Hi Bodri! - Hi! Come on get on
with it do it! Hurry up!
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Goddamnit. I don't believe this!
What are you doin'?
Relax! What the fuck do you have
to freak out at everything?!
Sorry, brother. Just wanted
to try it out.
Fuck! Holy shit!
The same thing happened to one
of those stupid kids last week.
- We had to call a locksmith.
- Bullshit! I'll open it in a second.
Fuck!
That can't be fuckin' true!
I've never seen such stupid losers
like you two in my whole life!
What did you say about me
and my brother?
Now get out of here!
No no no. You've just said something
about me and my brother!
What the hell is going on here?
Bodri, who are they?
What the fuck are you
doing here monkey?
They've got the scroll.
Looks like things in Hungary
have improved at last.
- I really hate getting fucked over
- What is the matter, Tibi?
"Matter"?
Fuck.
Since when did you start talking
so fucking fancy?
I tell you what's the
motherfucking matter!
Out of the three guys
I sent to do a simple job...
one got busted and the other
two are in the papers
- Otherwise all is great!
- Are we in other papers too?
I haven't checked them all yet.
So now we flick them all through!
- Good afternoon professor!
- We're closed!
- I'm Katalin Kun from TV Pannon...
- Péter Garas.
What can I do for you?
I'm doing a story on the robbery
at the museum.
I was told that it's your special
area of research.
The Roman scroll?
Yes, it has been stolen.
But it was not at all
my research topic.
Museum visitors are also
consumers you know.
Museums need to offer something
interesting to attract people.
So why is this scroll
so interesting?
It says that the scroll is so fuckin
important because...
it leads to a legendary treasure.
Some "ancient Romanian"
no shit...
"Roman" treasure of high value!
"The Stryx Aurum of which existence
is doubted. Experts say...
That's very interesting
but we have to deliver the scroll
in half an hour.
Stupid arsehole! Don't you get it?
Of course he doesn't get it!
You wanna say is that instead
of getting shitty 200 grand
we should go for the treasure,
right?
Tyson is clever, you see?
That's what I am talking about!
We should become partners.
We got the scroll.
Without us they can fuck
their treasure!
But we need backup for this.
Hell knows how many men
that "Milkman" has.
Who are you thinking of? Matyi?
You know that Matyi will come
with us anyway.
"Dotty Johnny" didn't send us
his nephew to just sit here
all day.
Matyi has to learn the business.
- And he'll learn a hell
of a lot from us. - Sure thing!
Now we need someone else.
So who do you have in mind?
Not HIM, do you?
Oh yeah HIM.
You mean... like HIM him?
HIM!
Look, professor! I know that
I'm really wasting your time...
But the sooner you give me some info,
the sooner I'll be leaving you alone!
All right.
Go to this address.
Here you'll find someone
who knows this legend.
He knows all sorts of legends.
He will tell you all you need
to know and even more,
about the Golden Owl.
Thank you very much, professor.
- You're welcome!
- Good bye!
- Oh, professor! What's the name
of this expert? - Theseus.
- Theseus?
- Theseus. He is your man.
An incredibly talented, smart,
and devoted "historian".
There are days when you know
nothing can go wrong.
The sun is shining,
birds are singing,
you have money for breakfast
and the troubles of weekdays
are far away! The world is mine.
We are going for a walk!
Except if it's the first
of the month again.
Just be cool guys!
We are pros.
Right Matyi?
Isn't my bullet proof smock-frock
too tight, boy?
Psycho, you stay here
and cover our asses!
...please!
Okay son! Just stay close
to Tibi!
- Hello!
- Hello!
- Are you the Milkman?
- No, I am Walter.
And I am Tibi.
Tibi Balog.
We brought you something.
Good. Let's swap, then.
This won't be that simple.
- What's so complicated about it?
- I didn't say it was complicated...
but it won't be that simple as
it was when we talked to the Milkman.
- Just give me the scroll now!
- Are you fuckin deaf, asshole?
Things have changed.
We give you fuck all
So call the Milkman right now,
and tell him that his business
partners want to talk to him.
His business partners?
Boys, boys, this is not
the way it works...
- We are not in the same league
- Not in the same league?
I knew that this is
what it's all about!
Are you looking down on us, right?
Look Tibi! They knew that we'd be
at least three of us
and they sent one guy.
One fuckin guy!
He'll take care of the fuckin
small time crook
and his looser gang for sure, right?
You talk from my heart!
We are five of us and you're
one, dickhead!
Put that away Tyson! Put that fuckin
gun away, will ya?
Fuck!
Where is that scumbag?
Can you see him, guys?
Where are you hiding you
fuckin bastard?
Show yourself or I'll blow
you up into pieces!
Fuck! Matyi!
Let's get outta here!
- Bodri! Give me a magazine!
- What?
I can't hear a thing
Give me a fucking mag!
I can't man! I have only one,
and that's stuck, too.
Don't give me that bullshit, man!
We're all gonna die here!
Tyson, I just can't give you
my mag!
Bodri, don't fuck about!
Is anybody home?
After the unexpected morning visit,
all I wanted was a frozen chicken.
I didn't expect to find two
when I got home.
The method of
"pouring dog food all over you
and then pressing your dick up
next to a Caucasian shepherd
dog's cage"
was Dotty Johnny's new favourite
Incredible how creative people
can be just to get back
ridiculously small amounts of money.
Pretty tough erection control.
Who are you?
I am a reporter from
the "Evening Extra".
I am investigating a story
about a Roman treasure.
- How much is it worth?
- Excuse me?
How much will it pay?
How much cash will it bring in?
- Are you talking about the treasure?
- Sure.
What treasure?
The Strix Aurum.
Do you know how long it took
for my shrink to make me say:
The golden owl does not exist
because it is just a myth.
A myth!
Professor Garas said
that you're some expert.
Who wrote about
the owl in his thesis.
Correction: I wrote the thesis
about the owl.
I also copied the content of the
whole scroll in Latin into my thesis.
And where is that thesis now?
I hope you didn't smoke it.
So, do you really think that
the Strix Aurum exists?
The Centurions journal was stolen
from the Museum of History
this morning.
They stole nothing else but
the scroll. Strange, isn't it?
Walter?
Boss, looks like he's dead.
Dead?
I'm gonna find it! I will!
If it really exists,
then I'm gonna find it within a day.
I always knew I was right!
- So, do you have the thesis then?
- It must be here somewhere.
Thesis, when was it? April, 1997.
That was Nancy Johnson.
Oops. Orpheus took it.
Orpheus?
My little brother. He probably took
it with him on tour by accident.
I'll have to get it off him.
But first I need to find someone
who has a car and some money.
Thanks for the info. Put this back
in the fridge, will you?
Ciao!
No pupil dilation. Poisoning.
Cream, get me the phone.
Nicotine patches?
Someone took off his clothes,
covered his body with those patches
and dressed him up again.
Who can be this sick?
Wow! Now that was fuckin cool!
This guy is fucking brutal!
What a crazy shit, man!
- Goddamnit.
- This guy is a crazy fucker!
Now we showed him what it's like
to mess with us!
Nobody's interested in the
fact that Matyi is gone?
Dotty Johnny is going to kill
us all!
Stop fuckin whining all
the time, Bodri, will ya?
By the time he finds out,
we'll be gone to Malibu.
I bet they're gonna call
us any minute.
The strong one rules. Let's not wait
until they call us.
He who hits first, hits harder,
if he's first to hit.
You are right, Tyson.
I'm gonna call that little prick.
I'll show him how to play the game.
Be tough on them, you hear?
I'll be tough.
Don't worry. Tough as a rock!
Hello?
Hello. Things have changed, buddy.
Tibi and his boys have done some
thinking lately...
asshole!
What happened?
I'm telling you: Things have changed.
We want more money.
You won't fuck with Tibi Balogh.
I thought a deal is a deal and you
can trust a mars word.
But it looks like things are still
the same in Hungary.
So it does. That's what I'm saying.
We want more money.
One million.
Cash.
One million? Wow! What an increase
from this morning.
Tibi, accept it! Accept it!
You hear me?
I don't think that we'll sell it
for this much.
- Stop rattling, Bodri.
- Sorry.
Two million.
Two million?
Petty cash. No deal.
Whatever you say.
It's not me who's
handling these kind of things.
You know, there is a war
criminal sitting
at the top of the Ardennes
mountains,
who is so incredibly wealthy that
he won his court case in Nuremberg.
If you play around anymore,
he'll send you some of
his Albanian friends.
For a little tip
they will hang you up inside out
on top of your mother's chimney.
You won't fuck with us. Neither you,
nor anybody else?
We know about the treasure, scumbag!
Give it back!
We are professionals, you cocksucker!
You have to give us fucking respect.
Where is your guy you sent?
Have you already buried him?
Fuck off!
Shit!
We are professionals!
We are real pros.
I told you we are going big time.
I told you, didn't I?
A gangster boss from Nuremberg?
Albanian hitmen? Oh, come on!
We were tough and that's all
that matters.
- And what's going to happen now?
- What'd you mean?
We have the scroll
That's just what I wanted
to talk about. The scroll.
It's not in Hungarian,
you know?
Yeah, believe it or not?
I do fuckin know
that those old Latin guys
didn't speak Hungarian.
That's why I brought along
a dictionary. Latin - Hungarian.
Don't worry, sir. I'll find them
and get the scroll back.
Forget it. If your friends decided
to go for the treasure
then we can't afford to lose time.
My driver will bring the robe
to Budapest within three hours.
If you don't have the scroll
you have to follow Decebal's way.
Okay. First of all...
- What does Concipio mean?
- Concipio?
Concipio. It' writes with a 'C'.
The Romans pronounced
the C like as we do K.
I'm saying it this way
so you understand it.
Wow! We are professionals.
Concipio,
"unite, confide, formulate,
compose"
I see.
And what does
"intersum" mean?
How do the Romans pronounce that?
Don't worry about that!
Tell me what it means!
"Intersum, -esse, -fui,
collectivity,
presence, interferes, mea,
tua, vestra,
interfering with" and after that
"acc. C. Inf.".
Don't bullshit me, man!
Tell me what it means!
It's not my fault that
you don't speak Latin!
We have to go by Decebal's robe.
The German's driver will
arrive to Budapest, soon.
Swedish!
Get going and find me Tibi Balogh
and his gang,
wherever the fuck they are!
SWEDISH
Cream. Get your gadgets ready
and make yourself useful.
CREAM
Let's bury Walter.
He was a good man.
MILKMAN
Look up the page with letter "C".
"C" like Cockroach.
Ok. What'd you wanna know?
"Consulo"
"Determine, ask for advice."
- Then acc.c. Inf.
- Tibi, this is not going to work.
You shut the fuck up, Bodri!
Shut up!
By the way, you are supposed to know
these kind of things, don't you?
You work in that fucking, shitty
Latin Museum, don't you?
Listen, listen Tibi,
talkin' about the museum...
there is an old fella, called Garas.
He's some kind of expert
or something like that.
This guy can translate this
in a second.
He has one of those really old
second-hand antique book shops.
Antique?
That's good. Antique is very good.
Tyson. Gimme the yellow pages.
DRIVER
Hello. I can see that you are
about to close
but it's fuckin important.
Well, if is so "fucking" important,
then just help yourselves,
gentlemen.
- You know what this is, right?
- Yes, it's Winnie the Pooh.
Not that! The paper inside it.
Yes, I know what that is, too.
Then you also know what we're
here for.
Translate it.
But this is going to take
quite a while...
No, it won't.
Let's see. "Concipio".
That means unite or confide.
You are a very intelligent young man.
I noticed that the minute you came in.
Thanks.
This is the journal of a Centurion
who decides to test himself
and he explains why he planned
a private conquest.
- Come to the point, gramps.
- "Nemo est propheta..."
We can read it, too.
That's not the difficult part.
Yeah, they pronounced the C like a K.
Young man, you happen to be right
again, but not in every case...
Tell us what's in that fuckin
piece of paper, asshole.
This memoranda handles some of
the points of the map of ancient
Pannonia as a guide
for a certain route.
These points might have disappeared
by today due to ground movements.
You won't fuck us over, old man.
Don't think that bald men
are always stupid, either.
You'll translate that shit on the way.
And uncle Tibi will keep
an eye on you
- so you don't fuck around,
got it? - Hello professor.
Let's go!
Herakles, my childhood friend,
used to be a bodybuilder champion
but when he had his ear pierced one
of those acupuncture points was hit
and he lost 20 kilos
of muscles in a week.
He was done in with a sting,
like Sleeping Beauty.
Theseus, how are you doing?
Let's go on a treasure hunt.
Oh no...
...not again.
You shouldn't get too hasty
about this Theseus.
What did the psychiatrist say?
Fuck the shrink. I'm fine.
Anyway if I don't pay Johnny
in two days,
his dogs are going to bite
my balls off.
Did you hear that someone stole
the scroll I wrote my thesis on?
See, others are after it too!
It might be dangerous.
Stop it Heracles!
You are just like my brother,
always afraid of something,
FBI, CIA, ticket controllers,
yakuza.
How much do you need?
Can't I help you?
A lot Heracles. A lot!
Even your BMW wouldn't be enough.
Here comes our man.
Do you have the robe?
The German sent another package, too.
He thinks we'll need it.
What kind of package.
A nice, big one.
Oh, boy!
Isn't this a little bit
over the top?
Well, it's still better that jerky 4x4.
What the hell is that?
My van.
- And the BMW?
- Went...
On holiday.
What's that on top?
Marketing.
Could we get rid of the duck
on the roof?
- What duck? It's a biceps.
- Is it? Oh, that's different.
Tibi, it's Dotty Johnny.
Fuck!
Oh, oh, don't you fucking
answer it Bodri!
Tibi... sure it was a good idea
to bring Matyi?
Shut up Bodri! Matyi topic is over.
When we have the cash and are
on our way to Malibu,
we can dump Matyi somewhere...
until then I really don't need
a giant gangster boss on our back!
Well, Gramps? Where do we go
from here?
We are at Székesfehérvár.
From what it says they must have
gone West towards "Pelso".
That's what Romans called
lake Balaton.
And what did they call Siófok?
Siofocus
Lunch break!
This is incredible!
NASA can suck it up!
This is the latest geo program.
Do you want to se what this place
looked like 6000 years go?
And this one is a translator program,
it knows all the dead languages.
Do we really need all these?
Well, if we had the scroll
it would be easier.
The Roman centurion didn't
like bullshitting.
He wrote everything precisely
down in his journal.
Where the war was. Where he went.
Even the exact place of the treasure.
But this is the sacred robe of a
Dacian chieftain?
Tell me, where do you want me to go?
That's the thing. It doesn't
say anything precise.
It talks about steps,
covered distances and how to get
from A to B and from B to C.
- Quite vaguely.
- Ok. Let's go to A.
Let me know when you are done.
Hi babe!
Give me a double chicken burger
and fries, coke no ice.
Fuck it
Exactly
So, coke no ice.
Wait a minute, darling.
This machine is fucked. I have
to change the bloody paper.
Can I take the time for a pee?
Ok, Tyson, you go with him.
Don't fuck around in there.
Move it!
Fast-fucking-food restaurant. Sure!
These Dacian metaphors
are rather shady,
but relax, the software
can handle it
This is a barbarian settlement
with a fountain in the middle.
Show me the terrain.
No doubt, this was Decebal's
settlement. It's to the Southeast.
That's where he left to the altar.
We have the starting point!
Let me make it simple, we want
FIVE hamburger menus.
- Drinks?
- Coke.
Hey, old fella, come out!
This wasn't part of the deal!
Do you want all of them with coke?
- All of them.
- Diet or regular?
- Regular.
- Ice in the coke?
- Don't!
- Eat in or take away?
I'm going to eat it right here
in the middle of the fucking road!
I only have to ask this inside
Super size drink and bigger burger?
NO!
Our Chinese dessert is really tasty.
Give me five hamburgers, five fries
and five cokes for fuck's sake!
I have to go through these.
- Asshole!
- Stupid cow!
Piss off! Do you have a smart card?
Action!
Holy shit...
Fuck it!
Where are you going?
Psycho, please...
Oops.
Fuck.
Oops.
Psycho, please!
Psycho, come on please, please!
Bodri, stop the fucking whining!
Oh, fuck, you look shit.
Tyson, Tyson, let's get
out of here! In the car!
Careful, Tibi. There is the
yellow guy!
Fuck! Tibi, fuck it!
Shit! Bodri, someone should
wash Psycho's face!
What?
The blood-bath erupted tonight when
four unknown armed men attempted
to rob the fast-food restaurant
The firing was still audible
while we were on our way here.
Witnesses report that the heroic
resistance of the promotion-figure
and the service staff foiled their
plan. They paid with their lives.
Jolán Horváth, Székesfehérvár,
the city of blood, horror and terror.
It's Swedish. I'm on the way
to Székesfehérvár.
Don't do this, ok?
Relax! You are a fucking
nervous wreck!
Ok Tyson!
So after killing four people
the next thing to do is to relax.
I'll relax! How? Deep breath?
Yoga breathing?
Or are you going to give me
a foot massage? Come on!
Bodri! Shut it! Stop shitting
yourself!
The police are fucked.
Milkman is a loser, and Dotty Johnny
thinks his Matyi is alive and happy.
We shouldn't have done that!
Is there any more booze in the back?
Yesterday I was sitting at home,
today I'm an accessory
to a multiple murder.
Accomplice.
Nobody asked you gramps!
Fuck off!
The fast food restaurant
assassins are on the run
with a stolen white van.
Hang on, I have their descriptions.
One with a beard, strong features,
flamboyant orange jacket
and latex pants!
Do they have their
descriptions too?
Sure, that's the least.
At the morning robbery,
one of them was left there.
He locked himself in ancient stocks
and the others left him there.
They kept trying for a while
and gave up.
They broke the exhibition,
knocked out the old porter and left.
Is he talking about us?
Wait, we have a caller...
Fuck off not-funny bastards, it isn't
easy opening ancient stocks
you couldn't have made it either
assholes!
And if you try to make fun
of Tibi Balog and his gang,
we'll come round there
and kill your fucking lives!
Do I make myself clear,
you motherfucking bastards?
Nobody's going to make fun of me,
not even you, you fucker!
Just to make it clear to everybody:
We are being chased
for multiple murder, idiots.
Everybody shut the fuck up from
now on, and do what I say!
I'm the boss because I'm the
only one here with brains. Clear?
I need a sextant.
What's that?
It's a device which helps you find
directions using the stars.
We have to go towards Tihany
but to find the exact directions
I need a sextant.
Right gramps.
Everybody got it then?
Now we piss off to Tihany
and on the way get a sextant.
Check out my little brother's fans.
Come on, let's go.
We might be able to catch
him before the concert.
I'm spending serious amounts
on your image.
And you told the press
that your favourite food is cold
tripe on bread!
You can't say such things!
Ok, so what can I say then?
You kill your hunger
and thirst together by drinking
chocolate milkshake with cream
- and your idol is Bon Jovi.
- Ah, come on!
Hey, the Zsozsó said that I should
make some shots for the new video.
You do something silly with a towel
in the changing room and I film it.
Ok, action.
Fuck!
Tibi, Tyson is not well.
What? Tyson, for fuck's sake,
why do you drink if you can't?
Get out of my car before
you throw up in it. Careful.
Keep it low from now on!
- Come on Bodri!
- OK
Get down!
Tibi, this job is too big for us!
Chill out. We need that sextant!
Stay here and keep a look out!
Tibi watch out! Camera!
We'll sort it out! Come here!
What are you doing?
Wrap something round it.
Tibi, you're wobbling too much.
I've got you, but let go of my face.
Cover that fucking camera,
for fuck's sake!
Ready?
Ready! Fuuck!
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop whining you fucking cretin!
Idiot!
It's on, it's on.
Aaaah, Tibi!
- Fuck!
- Sorry about that Tibi!
- Tib, this wont work.
- Yes it will.
- Tibi!
- What?
Tyson just fell into a fountain.
What the hell are you staring at?
Fuck it!
Ooops!
Bodri, come in. Tyson, you too.
- How does this sextant look like?
- Fuck knows, just search for it.
Come on Tyson! Move it.
Let's concentrate.
We can't fuck this up now.
Sorry.
When my brother Orpheus joined
the Chilli Boyz
he made me promise that I would
never go to see him perform.
But this was an emergency.
I needed my thesis
for the journal's copy.
I had one more day to pay
Dotty Johnny back.
Can I get an autograph
on my left tit?
Bro! What you doing here?
You've lost some weight.
You stopped working out?
Are you still eating properly?
- Where is Nancy Johnson?
- Who?
Nancy Johnson, the April '97
issue you nicked off me.
I had my essay in it.
Ah, Nancy. It's round
here somewhere.
It was here earlier.
Are you looking for this?
I desperately need a coffee.
You two, keep your brains busy.
Boss.
The place we're going is
next to the Romanian border.
On the top of some hill if
the computer's got this right,
"the all-seeing-eye rests on
the god of war's forehead."
Great.
Look for the shortest way to Gyula!
What's that?
Turn on the outside camera.
What's he doing?
Him?
He's trying to steal petrol...
Did the bullet go through his head?
Yeah
Show me.
Ok, let's go.
"Ok, let's go". That's all you
know you stupid cunt.
Boss, the computer is fucked.
Great.
Hey, have you seen Orpheus?
Chilli, Ziggy and Tommy G
have changed 30 minutes ago.
- Not Orpheus.
- Fuck!
What's so hard to understand boys?
I have the essay with the route.
You need the owl, I need the story.
Hmm, self-realisation
in the Hungarian Media.
Wait, let me think... Sorry,
can't help!
I think you need help.
So, deal?
What the fuck's going on here?
You have to be on stage
in five minutes.
Chilli, Ziggy and Tommy G have
been ready for ages.
Who are these? What are you
drinking? Who is that tart?
I don't know. They keep sneaking in.
I don't give a fuck. And all you fucking
arseholes can get out, too.
You get yourself on that
fucking stage!
Listen here, perhaps,
you are the king on this
pile of shit,
but your vocabulary is lacking
a little if "fucking arseholes"
is the best you can do...
Sanyi!
Throw these scums out!
You've picked the wrong guy now.
Sanyi, you're a smart guy.
Let's talk about it!
Hey, Curly.
Let's go.
There's a slight problem
with the flat.
Don't go home if you don't have to.
Twat.
As we left the dressing room
I knew what would happen.
I could bet a grand, OK, 70 forints
on that no matter
how sparking the pop life style was,
Orpheus will come with us.
I can replace you.
I could put another band anytime!
Another Bender boys!
I located our way with the help
of the sextant.
All signs point towards
a catacomb system
where we have to find Latin signs.
Catacomb sure.
Have you found the signs?
There's a couple.
Show me.
Let's see what Tibi got.
"EXIT"
Good, good.
We'll need that if we want
to get out here.
I found this.
"In vino veritas". A wise saying.
These are good for nothing.
There's fuck-all here but no treasure.
I said it was pointless to come here.
I got something too.
Vino drinkere therma bathere.
It means those who drink
lots of wine
will find healing in the thermals.
I think this points towards
a nearby bath.
- And?
- Gentlemen!
Up to the Heves
thermal baths!
Heves? Nothing closer, arsehole.
Heves is fucking miles away.
"The slower you go,
the longer you live".
What's your problem?
We go swimming.
Cream, can you fix it?
Sure, give me a minute.
If we follow the distance
the Dacians covered,
then we get back to almost
where we came from.
Next to a village called Nagyecser,
in the middle of the puszta.
Of course we didn't know it
until now.
I only hope that Nagyecser
is point B and not point C.
Or D.
We've got a problem.
Please, don't start any more
sentences with this today.
There is no problem.
Get out and shoot him!
Clear?
Clear as a Dacian metaphor.
Good day! Routine check.
- What's the problem?
- This is a national park.
You can't bring that
thing through here.
We're in a hurry. Can we sort
this out some other way?
Sorted.
A guy has left a band again.
- Which band?
- Chilli Boyz. Where is Tractor?
- He's nicking a car.
- Good.
The boy's called Orpheus.
Find him and tell him that
this isn't how things go.
And bring him back.
Give me his photo.
That's what I'm barking about.
He is on the cover of every
fucking teen mag. Buy one.
Then give me some money.
He's gonna be here for tonight's gig.
Couldn't you have found a more
gangster-looking car than this?
This was the easiest to get.
Look what I found.
Fuck that!
You stupid? Stop fucking about!
What's up?
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!
All right, Ok, I'm going.
That woman doing the rentals
was fucking with us!
- Nobody will notice.
- Come on Bodri, this stuff is cool.
Sure Tyson, you look like
a pig in tuxedos too.
Are you sure the fur should
be inside?
Shut it, cheetah!
You don't look so hot,
either, Tarzan.
We're not far from our goal.
Let's go to the thermal geyser.
What are you looking at?
Give that to me, please!
Shuts it and moves!
Psycho, Tyson, to the cave!
We know each other from the Museum.
- What's your name again, son?
- It's none of your business, gramps!
Would you bring me a glass
of water, please?
Ok. No tricks,
right?
It's bloody dark in here.
That's what I wanted to say.
Why don't we turn the lights on?
Check the walls!
You go left, I'll go right
and Psycho will cover us.
I've found something.
A switch!
- Fucking switch it on!
- No way man, it's wet!
Don't worry! Everything is wet here!
Whoa, shit!
Tibi!
This is fucking live!
Help me!
What the fuck are you doing?
What do you want me to do?
I read somewhere that you've got
to cut the power.
Fuck it hurts.
Hang on Psycho, don't kill him,
we'll solve it somehow.
There. It's fucking dark again.
Cream, have you found
the destination, yet?
The direction is obvious,
the end could be anywhere.
But what certain is that they
headed for the great plain.
Where they met the Romans
I don't know.
Not too encouraging.
There has to be a stone altar
round here.
- Hopefully somewhere above ground.
- If we're lucky.
Boss, let's make a deal.
I draw a line from this spot to
where we have to go.
I'm gonna drive slowly
and you look around.
Drive? You're gonna drive?
Get it out of your thick head Cream!
Now, we'll play, perhaps for
the first time during our mission,
that everyone does what they
are here for
so shut up and draw that fucking line!
Boss, I don't want to be an arsehole
but without this line you'll wander
around the puszta for a while.
Who knows where Tibi
and his bunch of losers are?
Right? Right.
So give me the keys, I'll draw
the line and everybody's happy.
Is that him?
How'd I know? I've never seen him.
Here it is; tall guy with
blond hound-like hair.
It says here that he's got blue eyes
and pretty face.
- He likes chocolate shakes.
- This one here is half bald,
just drunk half a bottle of cherry
palinka and is stoned.
- Fuck, he is eating cold tripe.
- Yuck!
Anyway that's the car. Let's go.
- Hey buddy! Listen!
- Listen up!
We're looking for Orpheus.
We're his friends.
All right, all right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's one condition:
The story is mine on a prime-time
programme.
Heracles come here.
Oh my god!
We were half an hour in that
fucking sweatbox
and do you know what we've found?
Bloody nothing!
How come, you're the scientist and
we don't find fucking nothing?
Kill him Tibi.
Are you going to kill him here?
Tyson is right,
shoot him in the head.
Yeah, Tibi. Make it look
like a suicide.
Wait, I'll tell you what
you want to know.
What, what?
We got to go somewhere again?
Heh?
To travel across this fucking
country again?
That's it Psycho, smash his head in.
I'm gonna call the Milkman and
sell him the scroll for 2 million.
The treasure doesn't exist.
No one has ever found proof
to it!
So what's in the scroll?
I don't know, I've never read it.
I deal with serious matters,
such as cultural anthropology.
One more reason for you to die.
Ok old fella, so why we did we have
to cross the country
twice?
We could have gone anywhere.
Tibi smells something fishy.
Now read this fucking
scroll carefully,
and tell me what the fuck it says.
Look at that.
It's waiting or you my friend.
So what exactly are you thinking of?
According to the text,
the flow of the stream
gives us the direction.
We have to find where it
comes to the surface.
According to the centurion's journal,
it can't be more than a few
of hundred meters from here.
You've got to jump in.
Me?
Yes.
Are you ready?
Yes, but nothing's changed.
The centurion says that they
left Aquincum,
went towards a mine
and followed a stream
which originated
at today's Hortobagy.
But the Hortobagy is fucking huge.
What's gonna happen to the money,
and Malibu?
Chill out!
I've got an idea.
Let's go do business.
When you come to the surface,
give us a call and we'll
come and get you.
- Ok?
- Yeap.
Great little plan.
Lower me down to the I don't know how
cold, I don't know how deep stream.
Friend.
I'm telling you I'm Orpheus.
Let me go.
Go on, sing! Go on then!
- Stop whining or I smash your nose.
- Ok, OK!
"If all would glow, if it could snow,
love'd be here, and I'd buy
a red rose to you"
Bravo! Well done you idiot.
Do you know what a handbrake is?
I pulled it. I swear.
No you fucking didn't.
Look what you've done.
You've fucked up my car.
You're such a cunt!
You pulled your dick,
not the handbrake you jerk!
What happened?
I don't know, they wanted to know
if I was Orpheus.
I told you I was afraid
of the yakuza. See?
Who are they?
I don't know but the story
is getting more interesting.
Let's get out of here before
they come round.
Where is Heracles?
Underground. For a while.
We've got a problem.
We've had problems before, I guess.
No, not so far.
Not at all.
The Legionary was killed
by nicotine patches,
Cream got hit by a tourist bus,
and the Swede was sucked up in
the fucking Hungarian reality!
- Boss, relax.
- Don't tell me to fucking relax,
I've been in this country
for twelve hours
and my life is already ruined!
I have no fuck all, no money,
no scroll, no Cream,
no Walter, no Swede.
Just a fucking robe
with millions of motives,
a bloody impatient,
dirt rich ex-strubanfurer prick,
who wants that bloody owl!
I've got Tibi and the boys.
There is a God.
Kill them all.
Bring me the scroll to Nagyecser.
Suddenly we really are in need of it.
- Hello
- This is Tibi!
This is Milkman!
Are you still interested
in the scroll?
Am I interested? More and more!
If you want to know whether
my 2 million offer still exists, ;
of course!
2 millions?
Shove your dirty little
2 million up your arse fucker!
Do you want more?
- Don't go easy on him!
- I won't
I'm hard as a fucking rock,
you hear me?
Fucking hard! Tibi and his mates
get into business!
70% and no dodgy stuff.
20 million?
That's exactly 10 times
more than 2 millions.
That's a great deal of money.
Yes a lot.
That's about what
we thought, too.
Where do you want the scroll?
We are here at the edge
of Hortobagy
by a village called Nagyecser.
No need to hurry, take your time.
20 million... They're in on it.
20 millions!
Fuck! How much more
does it worth then?
It's a trap.
Yeah it is Tibi's trap.
Tibi takes it all.
That's it.
We are on track.
These amazing stalactites
grow 0. 1 mm a year.
It takes Nature a hundred
thousand years
for these little columns to grow.
It's me.
I'm in a cave.
Don't know. I ask.
What's it called?
The Owl's lair, undeservedly
forgotten stalactite cave of Hungary.
The Owl's lair, undeservedly
forgotten stalactite cave of Hungary.
Owl's liar!
Ok, I'm waiting for you here.
Hortobagy, yeah? Nagyecser, yeah?
You are very lucky old man!
Then I'll shoot him now.
You shoot nobody, jerk.
Don't you understand?
We are going to Nagyecser.
But instead of handing
over the scroll,
we'll kill that son of
a bitch Milkman.
Then we dig. Milkman's dead,
old guy's dead,
and we have 20 millions and
a fucking massive treasure. Clear?
- It sounds beautiful.
- Let's make Tyson happy too.
Fuck.
Bodri somebody's going for petrol.
Oh come on!
Why don't we stop someone?
Can you see someone?
No problem.
Go on then for fuck's sake.
What are you waiting for?
Was it a good idea to send him?
He's got to do something as well,
we are a team.
And he can't fuck this up.
Hey brother, can you give
me some petrol?
Stop the car. I need to take a leak.
And pull the handbrake on.
This plain is as flat
as a fucking pancake.
You know where the next slope is?
At bloody Mezökvesd,
and that's upwards anyway!
Shut up! Pull the
fucking handbrake on.
See, you can do it!
See Heracles, I told you
it'd be fine.
I'm not talking to you Theseus.
Where are my clothes?
Let's go. It's them.
The handbrake is stuck.
- Let it out for fuck's sake!
- It's bloody stuck!
Then it'll stuck out!
You idiot, prick.
Malibu, eh? I'm gonna buy
a huge fucking yacht
and put all the whores
in Malibu in it.
Thanks for the ride and the...
Nice bike.
Who the fuck are you?
Tibi, he's going to kill us.
I know.
Tibi, do something!
Hey beardy, let's talk.
We're on the way to
pick up big money,
Come with us and you can kill
a couple of scumbags.
After that you can come with us
to Malibu.
Don't shoot! Malibu!
I'm gonna shoot him
Admit it Theseus, you were wrong.
Does it look like the ruin of
some ancient altar?
I'm tired, and hungry.
I see no story in this anymore.
- Let's go home!
- Go home! Nobody asked you to come.
This is the place!
The Roman centurion and Decebal
battled right here.
- I'll get the spades.
- The owl has to be here too!
This must be the base of the altar.
We need to find other parts
to determine the front.
The owl is buried in front of it.
We'll make it. Relax.
We are pros, we will make it.
Tyson is gone but you gonna be fine.
I need a hospital.
You don't need a doctor.
You are fine.
Hold on we're here.
Can you see the sign?
Nagyecser! We are here!
I get some fuel and move, Ok?
Shouldn't he be here already?
Swede is my best man.
He'll be here with the scroll.
What the fuck does he want?
Can you give me some petrol?
Everyone's after petrol
in this country.
I've run out. I'll pay.
Go help this wreck.
What?
- Do you have a tube?
- I need that too.
- Do you need my dick too?
- What?
- Are you transporting money?
- Wha'?
Oh, no.
We are on a mission,
but that's a secret.
Your wreck easily sucks
up 35 litres.
It's only good in city transport.
Not good for the country trips.
Don't worry about me.
Who dares us, will die.
A huge bear with a beard on a Harley
just tried to kill us
with his massive gun
but we shot him in the head.
The prick, he tried to fuck with us.
Thanks that'll be enough.
I don't need any more.
What's up?
Tibi.
How do you know my name?
Are you the Milkman?
Brother!
Tibi for fuck's sake!
You gonna die now.
You wanted to fuck me over again.
Come back!
- So this is Tibi.
- You are smart.
I'll go around, cover me.
Who the hell was that?
Look at that!
I think we've found what
we're looking for.
A few losers next to a big stone.
I had four full magazines before.
Where have I shot that many?
The guy in the suit, at dawn,
the bitch at the Burger Bar,
well she deserved it,
the French fries and the fat biker.
Let's go. One, two, three.
How come we've run out of bullets?
Milkman can suck up!
Come on, let's go.
Where are you going?
Come Psycho please.
Come on!
Psycho, check please for ammo.
Tibi, this is too much for us!
Where the fuck is he going now?
Lift it, there it is!
Who is that?
I told you!
Get ready, guys. Something's going
to happen here.
They've got weapons!
Grab something!
Come on, Psycho! Hurry up!
Bodri, go!
Dear Tibi, and you all,
whoever you might be.
You might believe me, when I say
that under normal circumstances
I wouldn't care about
who you guys are.
Looking at you people here
I wouldn't give a flying fuck
about who you are.
But right now I'm dying of curiosity.
I'd really like to know
who the fuck you are
and what the bloody hell
is going on here.
So? Who's first?
I'm Theseus. Treasure hunter.
Oh really?
And who are you?
I am the publicity.
Nice name you got there.
The Strix Aurum on the cover pages?
Exactly. That might interferes
with your plans,
whatever these plans might look like.
But let's continue
introducing ourselves.
Who are you?
My name is Ferenc, Bodrogi Ferenc,
my friends call me Bodri.
I am a security guard at
the museum...
well, probably I was only,
because when I go back
there they'll fuckin fire me.
Shut up, Bodri.
Where's the treasure?
Let me introduce you
the great Tibi Balogh,
internationally well-known
and appreciated relic hunter.
Right, dear Tibi?
Let's stop this circus here.
We all came for the statue
and the question is:
Who is going to take it home?
What if the whole thing is
just a myth?
We've been through this already,
old man.
- Get the fuck back into the car.
- Professor!
Shouldnt you check if the statue
is actually buried here
before you start slaughtering
each other?
You don't say! There are reasonable
people here, too?
Throw it away. Everybody.
Throw it away.
I said everybody. Tibi!
You too!
Lift it up!
Psycho, come on, help us.
What the hell are they doing?
I have no idea but there is
that Orpheus-guy.
Come on, get the sack.
It's unbelievable!
There's a chest.
You see, Bodri?
I told you!
I can't believe this.
The Strix Aurum!
There it was.
The end of the Stryx Aurum.
And somebody did take it home.
Lays, stays!
Is this fish poisonous?
Is it poisonous?
Calm down boy, it's just a dentex.
Hey! Nobody wants to have a look?
My treasure! My treasure.
Don't bother. It's empty.
Somebody was faster than us.
That means only one thing for me.
I am not the best anymore.
Why is it empty?
I quit. I retire.
No problem. For the operation Strix
Aurum you don't have to pay a cent.
Furthermore I'd like to offer
somebody in case that you will need
similar services in the future.
He is a real pro
with a good team.
Here's his number.
Adieu!
The Milkman retired indeed.
He went on a long journey
and was chasing treasures of
a different kind.
Orpheus was returned
to the show business.
However, the Chilli Boyz was full
only for a few weeks.
Ziggy, another member of the band,
has broken his contract during
a tour round Lake Balaton.
The manager says Ziggy will be back.
Until then they found
a talented young man
with financial troubles
to replace Ziggy.
Who is known for the fans
as MC Theseus
The Milkman did actually find
Peace and Happiness...
Far, far away from Hungary.
So the Milkman did fail at last.
The Milkman never fails.
And those Dacian barbarians
weren't that stupid, either.
They had found the perfect disguise.
What is it, that scares away
ruthless grave robbers?
A grave that has already
been robbed.
Or a grave that seems like it
has been robbed.
"Somebody was faster than us?"
Come on.
Call this number for me.
Hello? Who's talkin?
