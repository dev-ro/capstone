(screaming and laughing)
Mr. Plummer:
What is going on in here?
What is this mess?
Didn't you all promise me
you were gonna be quiet?
Melissa, put your phone away.
Put it away right now!
What is this doing out?
I asked you to be quiet.
And look at you.
Jacob, what is that?
It's the sky, Mr. Plummer.
Mr. Plummer:
A green sky with yellow stars?
It's Camp Jupiter's sky.
Now, watch out, Jacob.
Van Gogh ended up
cutting off his own ear.
(laughing)
Quiet. I said quiet, everybody!
(indistinct chatter)
Woman: Jake! Over here.
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey. Look at you.
What happened?
Your parents are going to be
coming home very late tonight.
Come on, let's go.
We'll pass by Papaya King
on the way home.
Yes.
(pen scratches)
(phone rings)
(phone beeps)
Jardine residence, good evening.
Sal: Good evening.
And who am I talking to?
- Who is this?
- Sal: This is Sal Bartolini.
I'm an old friend
of Max Jardine's.
- Is this Jacob?
- Yes.
Sal: Oh, Jacob,
the last time I saw you,
you were a little baby.
I guess you're all grown up now.
Mm.
Sal: Is your dad at home?
Or your mom?
No, they're not home yet.
Sal: Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your grandfather, Jacob.
Max and I knew each other
for so long.
We met when we were about your age.
You must be what, like, ten now?
Thirteen.
Sal: He was such a dear old friend
of mine, your granddaddy was.
Do you know
when the service is gonna be?
What service?
Sal: Well, the funeral.
I imagine there's going
to be a service soon.
- Hold on a second.
- Woman: Who is it?
I don't know.
Woman: Can I help you?
Jake: Is that woman
waiting for us?
Brian: No, she rents
the store downstairs.
(car door closes)
(bell rings)
Antonio!
Jake: Are you and Dad serious
about us moving here?
Kathy: Jake,
let's talk about it later.
I really don't wanna move
to Brooklyn.
Hi, Mrs. Calvelli, Brian Jardine.
- We've met.
- Of course.
I'm so sad for what has happened.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
Your father
was a such a wonderful man.
- He really was, you know.
- I know.
Antonio: What do you want?
- This is my son, Antonio.
- Hi.
And I don't think
you've met my wife, Kathy.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you. Leonor.
- I'm sorry, my hands are full.
Yeah, we're just having
a little reception upstairs,
- for some friends and family.
- Of course.
Brian: You know,
I grew up in this house.
When I was a kid, there was
a produce store down here.
Leonor: I know, your father told me.
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, thanks.
Ella the Harpy?
She's a nerd, but I
got a thing for redheads. Don't you?
Uh, I don't know.
- I'll take it.
- Oh, thanks.
- Tony: Tyson's such a douchebag.
- Oh, not in the end, he's not.
I just finished The Blood of Olympus.
Tony: I got the game. Wanna play?
- Now?
- Tony: Yeah.
I'd like to, but I can't.
It's my grandfather's funeral.
Tony: Yeah, I know.
I never know what to say
in these situations.
Jake: I think you're supposed to say,
"I'm sorry for your loss."
Tony: That's it.
- Here, could you carry this?
- Tony: Oh, yeah, sure.
- Sorry for your loss.
- Oh, that's okay.
Tony: Did you draw this?
Yeah, it's the sky
above Camp Jupiter,
- the day of the battle.
- Tony: You're a real artist.
Not really.
Tony: Yeah, you are. This is awesome.
- Brian: You got it, son?
- Jake: Yeah, I got it.
You know, you're gonna like
this neighborhood.
- It's become a very bohemian area.
- Jake: It's just a reception.
Tony: I know, but if you
move in, I can show you around.
My mom and I just live
a few blocks away.
Jake: I'm not sure we're moving in.
(indistinct chatter)
- Jake: Hi.
- Leonor: Hello.
It's a dessert we make in my country
for special occasions.
I hope you like it.
Kathy: Oh, my God,
you didn't have to.
Leonor: Max loved this cake,
so I thought...
Kathy: Come in, please.
You should come in.
- Leonor: It's okay.
- Kathy: No, please, I insist.
Leonor:
I just wanted to bring the cake.
I still have some paperwork
to do downstairs before I go home.
Kathy: Thank you for this.
Very kind of you. Thank you.
Woman: Excuse us, but we're leaving.
Oh, okay. Thank you,
thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you for coming.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you, thank you.
- Okay. Bye.
- Woman: I'm so sorry.
Oh, thank you so much.
- Great to see you, thank you.
- Woman: It was lovely.
Brian: Thank you, thank you.
(indistinct chatter)
(Brian sobs)
I don't remember this.
Oh, my God.
Her plate.
(sewing machine whirs)
Leonor.
Leonor: Hi, Kathy.
? (Latin music plays on radio) ?
The boys are in my office
in the back.
No, look what I just found.
My plate.
Kathy: I think that night we
just ended up taking everything
back to our old apartment.
And we packed things away
and I forgot.
- (Leonor chuckles)
- I'm so sorry.
No worries, please.
It's a beautiful plate.
Are you not working today?
I don't see patients on Monday.
I need a day a week...
- to organize my life, you know?
- Good for you.
The store looks cute.
We are not doing so well.
I like that dress, the green paisley.
Oh, I love that one.
- You should try that on.
- Oh, I have a lot to unpack.
Come on, it'll take you a minute.
- Perfection.
- Are you sure? I don't know.
Leonor: It looks great.
Let me tie this.
- The dress is beautiful.
- How much is it?
Whatever the price is,
I'll give you ten percent discount.
Let me see. Oh, no, up here.
- Okay.
- Did you make this?
No, not this one.
But everything here is
handmade designers.
This is 250, and it's made
by a woman named Talita.
She's Colombian, very talented.
Guys, what do you think?
(video game sounds)
Kathy: Jake?
Jake, what's our deal?
- Mom, I'm on vacation.
- Kathy: So?
Dad said it was okay.
We have this rule in the house,
no games during the week,
and no internet before five either.
But when they're on vacation,
they have all this free time.
- What are you going to do?
- Shh, quiet!
Watch your tone, please.
Mrs. Jardine, we're almost done
with this level.
Can we have
a few more moments, please?
Leonor: That's better.
Kathy: Sure,
you can finish this level.
But first you gotta tell me,
what do you think?
The dress.
Tony: Great. I actually
thought it was yours.
- Jake?
- Love it. Love the feathers.
(Kathy laughs)
(video game sounds continue)
What are you writing?
Nothing much,
only an idea that occurred to me.
An idea for a short story.
A young girl grows up on
the shores of a lake, as you have.
She loves the lake as the gulls do,
and she is as happy and as free
as they are.
Director: And then here
you can counter.
But a man sees her...
who happens to come her way,
and he destroys her out of idleness,
as this gull here has been destroyed.
Director: Okay, good, what are
you saying to her right now?
That's lovely, I love that.
But what are you saying to her,
do you think?
Where is it?
Brian: Why don't you come and
help me prepare dinner tonight?
Where's Mom?
Brian: Your mother had
an emergency with a patient.
She's not gonna be home 'til tonight.
- Another suicide?
- Brian: Jake!
Jake: Dad, I can't find my drawings.
What drawings? Help me cut these.
The series I made on Percy Jackson.
- The Sea of Monsters.
- Brian: Those old drawings?
Yes.
Brian: Did you look in the trunk?
Yes, Dad, I looked.
They're not there.
Brian: Well, I don't know, Jake,
maybe they got thrown away.
Why would you do that?
They're my drawings!
Why don't you just make new ones?
'Cause new ones are never
gonna be like the old ones.
Jake, we moved.
We got rid of furniture.
We threw away clothes,
gave away books.
- We got a new apartment.
- So?
Hey, let me tell you something.
It's good to get rid of stuff.
It's a little hard at first,
but then it feels really good.
Just gotta learn to let go.
Brian: I play Trigorin,
a celebrated writer
and the boyfriend of a...
famous actress...
Arkadina.
There's also Nina,
who is the neighbor's daughter,
and she wants to be an actress.
And at first we think
she's in love with Konstantin.
She ends up having an affair
with my character, Trigorin.
Jake: Sounds complicated.
Mm. Well, it's complex.
But it's also unexpected.
It has a lot of humor in it, too.
What part?
(door opens)
Good. You're already eating.
- Jake: Hi, Mom.
- Brian: How was it?
Kathy: Fine. She's doing good.
The problem now is her husband.
The last thing I want to do
right now is talk about work.
I was telling Jake
about the new play.
I'm starving.
Jake: I thought you weren't working
with the train anymore.
I thought you were gonna do
Broadway now.
It's not that simple.
You said you weren't doing
this non-profit stuff.
That the strategy was
to reach a wider audience.
Things have changed.
You should applaud your father
for being adaptable.
It's what life's all about.
(kids shouting)
- Hey, Tony! We need one more!
- Tony: I can't.
- Why can't you?
- I gotta get home.
Watch out, Katy Perry!
(speaking in foreign language)
Tony: Twelve minutes and 23 seconds!
From Jake's house to here
in 12 minutes and 23 seconds.
Jake: Good afternoon, Mrs. Calvelli.
Leonor: Hi, Jake.
You haven't said hello, Mister.
- Hello, Hernán.
- Hola.
That's my friend Jacob Jardine,
but we call him Jake.
- Hello there, Jake.
- Hi.
- Jake, Hernán.
- So you're the grandson?
Yes, Max was his grandfather,
and his father is Brian Jardine.
The one I was telling you about.
Yeah, he's an actor.
And my mom's a psychotherapist.
Hernán: Huh. So how are you enjoying
Brooklyn so far?
Jake: I like it a lot. Yeah, it's...
It's a lot more peaceful
than Manhattan,
and we have much more space.
It's great.
So are you going to be an actor?
Like your father?
Jake: I don't know.
Hernán: Well,
you look like an artist.
The long hair, everything.
Maybe.
He'll tell us more later,
right, Jake? Go ahead.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
So, that's the son.
(video game sounds)
Hey, your dad any good at acting?
I don't know. Maybe.
I thought if he was, he maybe
could gimme a couple pointers,
'cause I wanna be an actor
when I grow up.
Oh, sure, yeah, I guess.
He's not that successful or anything.
My dream is to go to LaGuardia
High School for Performing Arts.
You heard of that school?
Well, you know,
Nicki Minaj went there...
Al Pacino, but he flunked out, so...
Yeah, I think my dad applied there.
Oh, really?
Well, it's my dream school.
I've been looking around
for some theater classes,
you know, been practicing on my own.
Gonna audition next year
for the ninth grade.
It's gonna be a lot of work
and a lot of practice.
I might need a partner, okay?
- But I'm not an actor.
- That's okay, can you read?
These are some of the scripts
I'm working on.
Like Ah, Wilderness! and Pariah
by August Strindberg.
It's perfect for us to work on,
'cause it's just two guys.
You know what?
Focus on your art more,
maybe we could both go
to LaGuardia together.
Wouldn't that be great?
- I guess I can try.
- That's the spirit.
- Is Hernán your mom's boyfriend?
- That's disgusting, no!
He's a friend from Chile.
My parents are married.
They just don't live together.
- I don't understand.
- (scoffs) Me neither.
My dad travels a lot.
He's a nurse who works for the UN.
Where is he now?
Tony: He's in Angola, it's in Africa.
Look what he sent me.
Jake: Do you miss
having him around more?
I used to. But it's been a while now,
so I've gotten used to it.
Yeah, sometimes my dad goes away
if he's shooting a movie.
But it hasn't really happened
in a while.
Tony: Found it.
My dad said
he's gonna take me on safari,
and these are the animals
we're gonna see.
That's really cool.
Do you wish
they still lived together?
I used to. When my dad comes,
he'll cook porchetta.
It's like a roast pork butt.
That's... (laughs)
- It's good.
- That's disgusting.
It's good. We sit at the table,
you know, just the three of us,
and my dad will tell us
about people he met,
places he's been,
and stories about Africa.
We seem like a normal family,
and then...
(clicks fingers) Boom.
They start fighting about
something stupid, like always.
And...
I realize it's better
when he's not around.
Jake: Imagine if your mom
went with you on the safari,
and they ended up
falling in love again.
There's a very little chance
of that happening.
Jake: But just imagine.
You get an envelope one day.
You open it, and it's
two tickets to a safari.
One for you
and one for your mom.
And she decides to go because
she feels like she needs a vacation.
So when you get to Africa,
your dad picks you up at the airport,
and takes you
to this incredible place,
like... Like this picture here.
You see lions
and elephants, giraffes.
And then it's the end of a beautiful
day in the African savannah.
Your dad wants to take you up
this big hill to see the sunset,
but you're too tired,
so you just say you're gonna
rest in your hotel room.
So they go, the two of them alone.
And when they get to the top,
the colors of the sky is like...
Like nothing
they've ever seen before.
A green sky with yellow stars.
(indistinct chatter)
Tony: Mami! Can I stay for dinner
tonight with the Jardines?
- Leonor: Hmm?
- Mami!
Can I stay for dinner tonight
with the Jardines?
- They're having hamburgers.
- Jake: And hot dogs.
Antonio, we have dinner at home,
and I can't come pick you up later.
And I don't like you
walking home alone at night.
Jake: Well, he could sleep over.
Have you spoken
to your father about this?
- Jake: He won't mind.
- Sure?
- Dad?
- Jake, yes.
- Can Tony sleep over tonight?
- Uh...
Hello, Leonor.
Leonor: Hi.
- You've met my sister Audrey?
- Oh, yes, of course.
Hi, Leonor, long time no see.
Jake is asking
if Tony can stay for dinner.
Jake: And a sleep-over.
Yeah, because after dinner,
it's gonna be too late
for him to walk home alone.
Tony, you wanna have hot dogs
and hamburgers with us tonight?
- Tony: Yes!
- That is a done deal.
Tony: Yes!
I just wanted to make sure with you.
Brian: No, no, no, please,
I can't tell you how happy I am
that Jake has a new friend.
You know, it's not easy with him
and other boys, and...
Great that the two of 'em
get along so well.
- Yeah.
- You have a great kid there,
but I guess you know that.
(chuckles) Thanks.
Leonor, do you want some wine?
You know, Brian and I wanted
to have a talk with you
about some things anyway,
so maybe now's a good time?
Oh, thank you, but...
I have to go back and finish
some stuff at the office.
Well, we just wanted a minute
of your time, if that's okay.
Right, Brian?
Leonor: I have to go back,
but thanks.
You know, Leonor,
ever since my father died...
just so much has happened.
You and I haven't really had
a chance to talk about the store
and all that stuff, and
maybe we could just
have a chat this week?
Oh, I'm sorry, but this week
is not good for me.
- I'm doing inventory, so...
- Next week?
- Could be.
- Thursday I have rehearsal.
We're gonna get
out of rehearsal early.
I could come by early evening?
- Sure.
- Great.
Come on, guys, burgers'll get cold.
The truth is that
the neighborhood is changing
and that's a very
old-fashioned store.
She did complain to me
that business is not so good.
Well, of course she's gonna say that.
The contract's up.
My guy told me that a similar space
like that in this area could get...
- Five thousand.
- That's crazy.
Cheese, mustard and ketchup, please.
Guests first. Tony, what do you want?
I'll have avocados, tomatoes,
onions, cheese and ketchup.
Audrey: Yeah, that's on the low end.
- Kathy: What's the number now?
- Brian: Eleven hundred.
For eight years? Never an increase?
Maybe we can talk about this
a little later.
Tony, did I hear
your father lives in Africa?
Yeah, in Angola. It's a small
Portuguese colony in Africa.
I wrote a paper on it last year.
I got a B+, which was
actually pretty good because
I only spent, like, an hour on it.
My teachers, they're whack, you know.
They'll give you a good grade
on something and you don't try,
but when you really work hard
and put your best effort into it,
they'll give you a bad grade.
Tony: Can you pass the ketchup?
I always like a lot of ketchup.
Thanks.
(subway passes)
Jump up! Jump up! Use your voice!
(shouting)
You're a tree in the forest.
And it's snowing!
(girl shivers)
You're the worst dancer in the world,
and you think you're wonderful! Go!
Yeah!
Give it sounds! Give it sounds!
(students make noises)
I'm going to introduce you
to a new relaxation exercise.
I'd like all the chairs
facing this way.
And with plenty... No, this way!
(students moaning)
Woman: Stop yelling, okay? Really...
Teacher: Keep your throat relaxed!
(screaming)
(arguing)
The genesis of acting is seeing.
Observation.
Understanding
what makes behavior, yes?
So when we do
the repetition exercise,
that person does it to us.
We simply react, yes?
So...
Start the exercise, take your time.
Girl: You're wearing a pretty shirt.
- I'm wearing a pretty shirt.
- You're wearing a pretty shirt.
- Do you like my shirt?
- (claps) No, no.
No questions! Observations.
- You seem mad.
- Girl: I seem mad.
- You seem mad.
- Girl: (scoffs) I seem mad.
- You seem mad.
- Girl: You seem mad.
- I like your hair.
- I like my hair.
- Boy: I like your hair.
- I like my hair.
How long have you been doing
this exercise?
Tony: How long you been doing
this exercise?
How long have you
been doing this exercise?
Tony: How long have you
been doing this exercise?
- I'm not playing with you!
- I'm not playing with you!
You know, you make me make
mistakes in my own exercise!
You know, you make me make
mistakes in my own exercise!
You make me make mistakes

You make me make mistakes

- I never wanna do another exercise!
- I never wanna do another exercise!
- You have a terrible attitude!
- You've got a terrible attitude!
- You have a terrible attitude!
- You have a terrible attitude!
Your attitude
is more horrible than mine!
Your attitude
is more horrible than mine!
You're a master
of horrible attitudes!
- You're a master of master horrible!
- You've got the Swiss cheese
up inside your skull
instead of a brain!
I got Swiss cheese inside of
my skull instead of a brain!
I don't know how you get
anything done all day long!
I don't know how I get
anything done all day long!
I don't know how you
get anything done all day long!
I don't know how you
get all the day done.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
You never know what you're
talking about.
I never know
what I'm talking about.
You never know what you're
talking about.
I never know
what I'm talking about.
You're gonna make me ask another
question, aren't you?
I'm gonna make you
ask another question.
- There you are, you did it again!
- I did it again!
- I did it again!
- I did it again!
- I did it again!
- I did it again!
- You did it again!
- You did it!
- You did it again!
- You!

- Get outta my face!
- Get outta my face!
- Get outta my face!
- Get out of my face!
Get out of my face!
(indistinct chatter)
Girl: Oh! Something in my eye...
Girl 2: See, it's right there. Look!
There!
(laughing)
Girl: Please, put him in a closet.
Girl 2: Trust fall. Fall.
- First, you have to kill him.
- Fall into me. Fall into me.
- (Tony groans)
- (laughing)
- Miles was like, "How are you?"
- Yeah.
Girl: Oh my God, yes.
Miles started it.
- Miles...
- No. 'Cause she said hi to him once,
so he said "hi" back,
and she got into the conversation...
Girl: Exactly.
Tony: And then she re-used my words
against me. And then...
Girl: She put words into my mouth.
She was saying...
(indistinct chatter)
(all laughing)
Oh, my God.
And I wanted to change it, but...
Coach: Let's go!
- Boy: Right here!
- Coach: Go, go, go!
Donny!
- Keep going!
- Boy: Back!
- Boy: Good save.
- Second boy: Nice one, Tony!
(indistinct chatter)
Hey, Umar, we should try
that thing that the Brazilian does.
So you look like you're gonna
pass it to one player,
but you actually pass it
to the other side.
That actually might be a good
idea, if you came to practice.
What are you talking about?
Dude, you didn't even show up
last Saturday.
Because Tony has a new boyfriend now.
(laughing)
Ask your sister if she thinks
I'm the type
to have a boyfriend. She'll know.
- Joey: My cousin Allen goes to 342.
- So what?
- Joey: That's his school, isn't it?
- What are you talking about?
Little Jake.
My cousin goes to his school.
- They say he's a weirdo.
- Tony: Shut up, Joey!
They say he draws dresses
for the girls during recess.
- Give that back!
- Tony: There you are, go ahead.
Eat it!
(students shout)
All: Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Mr. Plummer:
"...and the stars never rise,
but I feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
And so, all the night-tide,
I lie down by the side
of my darling, my darling
my life and my bride."
What's he saying there?
What's he talking about
when he says that?
I think that his love, kind of
like what they were saying,
he's imagining her
in his mind and his heart
because he loves her that much,
like, he's able to...
like, create a version of her
in his heart because...
Mr. Plummer:
Or it could even be literal.
I mean, he may actually,
several times a week,
go down and spend the day
lying next to her in her grave.
So what I want you to do
for your assignment is
try to write a poem.
Not try, but do it. Write a poem
about someone you love.
Okay? It'll be fun.
Or at least, make it fun.
That's your assignment.
(door opens)
- Hi.
- Jake: Hi.
- Hi, Leonor.
- Leonor: Hi, Jake.
Where are you going?
- Is Tony in the office?
- He is, and he's staying there.
He's helping me out today.
But we're supposed
to meet some friends.
Are those the same friends
that beat him up?
- What?
- Leonor: That's right.
They beat him up.
And you should ask him why.
Tony: What's up?
- What happened?
- Tony: Nothing.
- I bumped into Joey at soccer.
- Jake: But your mom said that...
She's so dramatic.
She deserves an Academy Award.
She doesn't want me
to go out with you
'cause she wants me
to help her with this. Look.
She's not good with numbers,
you know?
Go ahead,
I'll meet up with you later.
Okay.
Brian: I'm so sorry, Leonor.
Our rehearsal went late.
- Is this still a good time?
- Leonor: Yeah.
I sent the girl home early
so we could talk.
You wanna go in?
- I'm just going to finish this.
- Okay.
(door opens and closes)
(shutters close)
- The store looks nice.
- Leonor: Thanks.
Brian, why don't you sit down?
Brian: My...
sister and I were working
on a transfer of ownership.
It's...
It's almost done.
My father left everything in order,
the taxes and all of that.
The only thing still pending
is the store, which needs a lease.
You know, your father never
thought much about contracts.
And he was very happy
to have me here.
Max thought my store gave
glamour to the neighborhood,
and he was proud to be associated.
Well, the neighborhood's changing.
I'm sure you've noticed
the rents have gone up a lot
in the last couple of years.
Yeah, I noticed, and so did Max.
But it was his desire
that I stay here.
Brian: Well, we don't want you
to go away.
My sister has worked up a new lease.
We think it's very fair.
It's not market price.
We know that's not
even possible but,
still, you can't expect
to pay the same amounts
that you did
when you first moved in.
Here, just take a look at this.
Before we go any further
with this conversation,
I want you to take a look at this.
I am probably the last person to have
photos printed the old-fashioned way.
It's completely different than
seeing them on a cell phone,
don't you agree?
That's me in the backyard,
on July fourth.
Mm.
That's me, Tony and Max
at the Saint Anthony's fair.
That's us with my family,
when they came to visit.
Your father and I
were very good friends.
We spent a lot of time together.
What you and your sister
don't understand
is that your father
wanted me to stay here.
He thought of me as part of
this house, of this neighborhood.
I was more his family,
if you want to know, than you were.
Well, that's a ridiculous thing
to say.
You hardly talked to each other.
You never came to visit.
I was the one here.
I saw him every day.
This is not what I came here for.
Just, please, take a look
at the lease, okay?
Let's just get back to that.
It's very fair.
I don't need to.
I have an idea of what
you and your sister have in mind.
I'll just give this to my lawyer.
Okay, well...
there's nothing else
to talk about then, I guess.
Okay, good night, Leonor.
(TV sounds)
Kathy: Brian, can you give me
a hand here?
I have to call a patient.
Give me a moment. Is Jake here?
Yeah.
(video game sounds)
- Jake: Hi, Dad!
- Tony: Hi, Mr. J.
Brian: Jake,
you know it's a week night.
What are you doing
playing video games?
- Can Tony stay and eat with us?
- Brian: No.
Well, why not? He wanted to ask you
about your acting career.
That's enough for tonight.
Just turn this thing off.
- Jake: Dad, come on.
- I said no!
We're not even finished
with this level.
Tony, you need to go home now.
We can talk about acting
some other time.
Tony: Sure, Mr. J.
Your mom's waiting for you
downstairs.
Kathy: Did you ask your mother?
Tony: She loves
when Jake comes over.
- Please, Mom? Please?
- Jake, I just made dinner.
I'll eat it tomorrow
for lunch, I promise.
Okay, but I want you back here
in the morning.
- Yes. Thanks, Mom.
- Thank you, Mrs. Jardine.
- Please, Mami?
- No, Antonio.
Come on, Ma,
we got spaghetti in the fridge.
No, Antonio, when I said "no,"
I mean it. Don't ask me again.
It'll be super quiet,
aren't we, Jake?
Oh, yes, we're gonna be very quiet.
No, Antonio, don't insist!
It's okay, Tony,
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
- Leonor: Good night, Jake.
- Jake: Good night, Mrs. Calvelli.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Jake: See you tomorrow.
(siren sounds in the distance)
Tony: Yo!
Hey!
Hey, I'm not talking
to my mother anymore.
Why not?
- She said you can't come over.
- Why doesn't she want me over?
I don't know.
I don't think your dad wants me
around anymore either.
He may be too chicken
to tell you, but I can tell.
Why are they so mad at us?
Our parents are involved
in a business matter,
and it's getting ugly,
so they're taking it out on us.
You're right,
my dad was very cold to you.
I won't talk
to my parents, then, either.
- Tony: Really?
- Really. Not unless they apologize.
It's not gonna be easy.
You sure you can handle it?
- I can handle it.
- You're a great friend, Jake.
Jake: You too.
(door opens)
Brian: Hey.
Did something happen
with Leonor downstairs?
The store's closed,
but it's not even five.
Have you seen Tony?
Jake...
can you stop
joking around for a minute?
Did you see if the store was
open earlier when you came home?
Was it open?
No, it wasn't?
Jake, talk to me.
(phone rings)
Audrey, hi.
No, no, I haven't heard from her.
Today I got home early
and the store was closed.
I feel responsible.
We are responsible.
Audrey will tell you if
she thinks you owe her money.
- Don't worry about it.
- Well, she sort of did already.
- What?
- Yeah.
She told me
we owe her money for the store.
- Kathy: Incredible.
- Brian: Yeah.
Kathy: Jake,
did you see Leonor today?
Still not talking?
No.
You can't go on
like this forever, you know.
Tony: You look like
you've been doing this
acting thing for a long time.
Really?
When you did the Emotional Recall
exercise, it seemed so natural.
My father was a stunt man
when I was a kid,
so I spent a lot of time
on sets and stuff.
Tony: Oh, so you've been
doing this forever.
Well, no, because when I was
eight years old, he died.
Tony: Did he die doing a stunt?
- No, he had throat cancer.
- Tony: Oh.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Girl: Thanks.
- I'll see you later?
- I hope so.
Tony: Hey. You know anyone
with a swimming pool?
No, Why?
I would kill to see her
in a bathing suit.
- Could you imagine?
- I never thought about that.
So, who do you like, huh?
- They're all nice.
- You can tell me, you know.
- Tell you what?
- If you like someone.
- I don't know.
- That's what you always say.
Well, I do have an idea
you might like.
Yeah? What's that?
Eva talked about going dancing.
There's a matinee club,
like after hours, for kids.
- When?
- Sunday afternoon in the city.
- Let's go!
- Would be fun, wouldn't it?
That would be great,
if I could just dance with her.
Wow, Jake,
that's actually getting good.
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.
(sewing machine whirs)
Bianca: Hi, can I help you?
Thank you, I want to talk to Leonor.
- Hi, Leonor.
- Hi.
Just a second, let me finish this.
(sewing machine stops)
You're home early.
Monday.
That's right, your day off.
Kathy: That's a cute dress.
I made it.
Leonor, do you have a minute?
Leonor: I have to finish this
for a client tonight.
Kathy: Tony still not talking?
Not a word to me yesterday.
- Same with Jake.
- Leonor: It's very annoying.
One good thing, I have to say
is that Jake is painting
and drawing more than ever.
Leonor: Is that good?
Yeah, if he really wants to go
to LaGuardia,
he has to put together a portfolio.
Mm.
Kathy: ls Tony still thinking
of applying also?
How would I know?
It's been four days.
He hasn't said a word to me.
Kathy:
Listen, Leonor, you know that
I am trained in conflict resolution,
and I'm hoping to help here,
to help settle this problem
between you and our family.
Leonor: Has your husband
asked you to do this?
No.
Kathy: By the way,
he's been working very hard.
I'm not sure you know,
but he's rehearsing a new play.
No. I haven't seen your husband.
(sewing machine whirs)
I know he's been waiting
to hear from you.
(sewing machine stops)
Leonor?
Leonor: Not here.
Kathy: I know you think
we're the rich people
coming into this neighborhood,
but the truth is Brian hasn't
made any money in years.
I've been supporting our family
with my hard work.
- That's not my problem.
- Kathy: I know it's not.
What I want to tell you is that
we will give you time,
but we need this money.
We need the shop to cover its rent.
Not an unfair thing
to ask of a tenant.
The woman is trouble, Brian.
Once again, our warm,
lovable, unwise father
has left us a big mess
and no instructions.
I think that we should start
the eviction process right away.
I don't wanna have to do that.
It takes a while, you know.
I just don't want this to get ugly.
The boys are best friends now.
Just remember our dad worked
hard to leave us something,
and now you have this
nice big apartment to live in,
and I'm getting nothing.
Just give me a little more time.
I can't really do this
without you, Brian.
? (dance music plays) ?
Hey, do you want to come
to the beach with me?
- Eva: Huh?
- Tony: The beach!
You, me.
Yes? No?
No, Tony, you're really nice
and everything,
but I'm into older guys.
Oh.
- Thank you for being honest.
- Eva: What?
Thank you for being honest!
(indistinct chatter)
(indistinct chatter)
She doesn't acknowledge the lease,
she doesn't try and negotiate,
she has no plans on leaving.
Now she's actually hiring new people.
(sighs) I told you
this was not gonna be easy.
Audrey wants to start
an eviction process.
She's got a lawyer
ready to go already.
Good.
So it's decided.
Is it?
Who's gonna tell Jake?
I'll do it.
It's my problem.
Do it soon.
Please?
Woman: What are you writing?
An idea for a short story.
A young girl grows up on the shores
of a lake, as you have done.
She loves the lake,
as the gulls do
and she is as free
and as happy as they are.
But a man sees her, who
happens to come by that way...
and he destroys her out of idleness,
as this seagull here
has been destroyed.
Woman: Boris! Where are you?
Brian: I'm coming this minute!
What do you want?
We are not going away after all!
Woman: It is a dream!
(audience applauds)
So?
Did you understand why
Nina says she's the seagull?
Kathy: Jake, it's your father's
opening night.
You two ever think about anybody
other than yourselves?
Huh?
Say something, Jake!
(shouts) Say something!
One of the hardest things
to realize when you're a child
is that your parents are people too,
you understand that?
They care about things.
They make mistakes.
But they try to do what they think
is the right thing to do.
Does any of what I'm saying
make any sense to you?
- (giggling)
- What's so funny, Tony?
Huh?
Why don't you tell me,
what's so funny, Tony?
You think you got it in you
to be an actor?
Take one rejection after another?
We'll see how you react when
you don't get into LaGuardia!
- We'll just see then!
- Kathy: Brian!
Brian: Goddamn it!
Also try to arrange them
by color or tone.
I usually like to start with
lighter colors in the front,
and end with the darker ones.
Black goes in the back.
Hello, can we help you?
Oh, it's okay, Valentina,
it's for me.
He is Brian Jardine, our neighbor.
- He's a great actor.
- Oh, have I seen you in anything?
- I doubt it.
- He's in a new play.
- What is it called?
- The Seagull.
Oh, that must be very popular.
Can you give me
five minutes alone, please?
The day your father died,
he came by in the morning.
And I asked him to buy me
a pack of cigarettes.
And I never saw him again.
He cared about me, Brian.
Can you believe that?
Every day we'd...
talk and share things.
Have you ever had
a friend like that?
Someone you can tell anything?
Only my wife.
I'm a lot like Jake, I...
It's never been easy for me
to have...
(sighs) close friends.
I hope...
that you can understand
that what's happening
is nothing personal.
I can't pay three times...
what I paid to your father.
It's not possible.
I can't survive.
I thought you were in a new big play.
I am in a new play, but it's not big,
and it's not a lot of money.
It's just the way that it is, Leonor.
I'm fortunate that my father
left me a house in Brooklyn.
He wanted me to stay here.
He told me so.
And I also have a sister,
and she has a family too,
and we have to decide
what to do about this together.
It's not just up to me.
You know,
your father thought your sister
was the one who inherited his brains.
I'm sure he'd agree with Audrey...
that above all else...
it's important
to take care of business.
No, he wouldn't have.
I can promise you.
What do you want me to say, Leonor?
I have a family. We have bills, too.
Do you know why your father
didn't come to your son's birthday,
the last one?
Brian: He had the flu.
Maybe that's what he told you.
The truth is he was embarrassed
that everything in your house
was paid for by your wife.
He thought you should be
more of a man.
Well...
he's not around anymore...
is he?
He's certainly not.
Unfortunately, it's a clause that's
common in any commercial contract.
(sighs)
What am I going to do?
I can't afford this.
I told you not to go outside.
I told you not to go outside, Antonio!
I am up to here with this game of yours.
Hernán:
I'm sorry Leo.
Where do they get this number?
Hernán:
It's a penalty.
It's a penalty for overstaying.
That's why it's in the contract.
And there's nothing we can do?
Hernán: I've done everything I can.
There's nothing to do.
You have one week.
Una semana para abandonar este lugar.
One week to leave the premises.
Tony: Mami?
Tony: Hello, Mr. J.
Is, um... Jake home?
Brian: Yes.
He's doing his homework.
Tony: Um, I'd like to talk
to him, if I could.
Brian: Of course.
Come in. Why don't you
both come in, please?
Kathy: Are you sure we can't
get you something, Leonor?
I'm fine, thanks.
(door bursts open)
- Jake: Mom!
- Kathy: What's going on?
Mom, Tony told me Leonor's
being evacuated from the store!
Kathy: It's not "evacuated,"
it's "evicted."
How could you do that?
How could you do that to them?
It's a terrible situation.
The rent is too expensive!
She can't afford it, Mom.
So Dad just needs to give her
a discount or something so she can.
Your mother and I tried to
talk to you about this, Jake.
This not talking didn't help.
- Kathy: Don't blame this on him.
- It's okay, I'm talking now.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll never do that again.
- I promise, Dad, I promise.
- Calm down. Jake, calm down.
- But I have a great idea...
- Listen to me. Your Grandpa Max,
he didn't just leave this house
for the three of us here.
No, I know, he loved Leonor, too.
Tony told me!
Brian: Of course he liked Leonor,
but he left it for us
and for your Aunt Audrey.
But I have a great idea.
We go back to our old apartment,
and we rent this place and give
the money to Aunt Audrey.
Tony and I are both going to be going
to the LaGuardia High School for
Performing Arts in Manhattan,
so I don't need to take the
subway or anything to school.
I could just walk.
And you'll be closer to the theater.
I loved the show, Dad,
I loved it. I really did.
Tony did, too. We both talked
about it a lot afterwards.
And I thought
you were really good,
and I thought it was
really complex and everything.
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you then, I'm sorry,
but I really liked it, I did.
(sobs)
Brian: (whispers) Okay, okay.
Okay.
(kids shouting)
(kids playing)
(subway passes)
Mr. Jardine?
- Where were you, son?
- I'm sorry, Dad.
You still have a lot to do
to finish your portfolio?
Jake: I just need to finish one more
painting, and then I'm done.
That's what you said last week.
You just had to finish
one more painting.
I want them to be good.
Do you remember, by any chance,
a story about my friend Tina?
The one that sold her hair
in India for a train ticket?
No, that was Martine.
Tina was a girl I went to
high school with, she was a...
Oh. She was a dancer.
And her mother was a dancer. She was
literally born to be a dancer.
And during high school, she got
into a really good conservatory,
and I saw her a couple of times
after that, and
she was always getting ready
to get this or gonna get that.
Each time,
her arm would be in a sling,
or she would be on crutches.
And the last time I saw her,
I ran into her on the subway.
It was clear
she hadn't danced in years.
She was completely out of shape.
You would have never imagined
that this was the same girl.
Gee, thanks, Dad.
That's a very encouraging story.
Why didn't Tina go very far?
- I don't know.
- She trained too hard.
Huh?
She practiced too much.
She didn't just trust
her natural abilities.
Jake, you're gonna meet a lot of
really talented people in your life,
and they're not all
gonna be suited to be artists.
They're not all gonna
have the brains to know
when to insist and when to...
to stop.
When to push themselves
and when to just relax.
Most of them
won't all have that balance.
And how do I know
if I have the balance?
That's why I'm telling you this,
because
you're turning in
your portfolio soon.
And they're gonna love it.
I know they are.
And they're gonna love you.
And you're gonna go to LaGuardia.
And you're gonna have fun...
and some challenges, too.
But soon enough,
you're gonna find out
if you have that balance.
Do you know if Tony's still applying?
I don't know,
I don't know what he's doing.
(Brian sighs)
Brian: Well, I wish I had
handled that differently, son.
- What do you mean?
- Brian: Just Tony and his mom.
I wish I had told you earlier
what was going on.
Would it have changed anything?
No.
Probably not.
But Still.
Dad, would you mind
if I played one of my video games?
Would that be okay?
Brian: Of course.
Will Mom be okay with it?
Brian: I think so.
(video game sounds)
(indistinct chatter)
