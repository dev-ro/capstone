What do you think, Irving?
He makes this cheap dago move
on me, Bo Weinberg--
the man who took out
Vincent Coll...
the man who held Jack Diamond's ear
so he could put the gun in his mouth...
who found the rackets he was
too stupid to find for himself...
who made him something more than
the low-down fuckin' goniff that he is.
The schmuck!
I should expect something else.
He pulls me off the street, right in front
of my girl like he don't know no better.
- Schmuck.
- Don't talk to Irving.
- Talk to me.
- Men talk.
If they are men, they talk.
If they have a disagreement,
they discuss these things.
But you, I don't know, Dutch.
I don't know what stinkin' womb...
of pus and scum and ape shit
you came out of.
Bo, you should understand
I am past the madness part.
I am past the anger.
Don't waste your breath.
Never paid your debts, Dutch.
You never paid me what I was worth.
You never paid nobody
what they was worth.
Hey, Bo, look who came
along for the ride.
The more I done for you, the more
like a brother I was to you.
At least I counted.
I saved your life a dozen times!
- Hey, kid, you like boats?
- I don't know yet.
I protected you!
I did your shit work,
and I did it like a professional.
You always had
a way with words, Bo.
You got more words than me,
being I haven't been to high school.
But I got a good head
for current events.
- So I guess it all evens out.
- What's even?
I made you a millionaire!
I handed you a fortune!
You got more money
than you know what to do with!
I built this organization--
the beer, the unions, the numbers!
Twenty million dollars a year,
you'd have run it
like some goddamn candy store!
Look at it this way, Bo.
I'm the one sittin' here,
and you're the one sittin' there.
Now, who would you rather be
at this moment?
- Come on, lady.
- It's all right, Irving.
- You can bring her up.
- No!
No, Dutch!
Ah, feeling better?
You can sit her
down there, Irving.
Come here.
This is, uh,
very good malt whiskey.
- Go ahead. It'll settle your stomach.
- This is between me and you, Dutch.
Leave her out of it.
Bravo, sweetheart. Bravo.
You know what you're doin',
don't you?
I'll bet you know how to do
just about everything, don't you?
Dutch, for Christ's sakes.
It's over, it's done.
Did you say something, Bo?
You can see the trouble
your Bo is in. Right, Bo?
Show her how you can't do
certain things anymore in your life.
Show her how the simplest thing,
like crossing your legs
or scratching your nose--
It can't be done
anymore by you.
Sure, you can scream,
you can shout.
But he can't lift his foot.
He can't open his fly.
He can't tell you what time it is.
Little by little
he's taking leave of his life.
Irving, is there a cabin?
Down below, aft, the back end.
Mr. ''Class Act'' Bo Weinberg
moves against his best friend.
Against the man he works for.
That's class.
All right, miss,
if you'd be so kind.
Dutch.
So tell me, I'm just curious.
When did you two meet? How long
have you and Bo been lovebirds?
Just this way, miss. You know,
I have not had the pleasure...
of meeting you before tonight,
but it is clear that Bo is in love.
- It's clear--
- Uh, Irving.
Put me out, Irving.
I'm begging you.
Put the muzzle to my head.
I can't do that, Bo.
Please, Irving.
Sorry. I could give you a drink.
You want a drink, Bo?
You listen to me, kid. You take
some advice from old Bo Weinberg.
This man of yours
ain't gonna last long.
He's obsolete.
You know what that means?
Means he's finished, he's done.
He's up against tougher guys than him,
and they're better organized.
If you're as smart as they say you are,
you look out for yourself.
You listen to old Bo Weinberg.
Hey...
how did you get into this, kid?
Uh, juggling.
It was juggling got me into it.
I'm tellin' ya, there ain't been
a beer truck around here for weeks.
- What the hell does that mean?
- What are you, stupid?
- No, I ain't stupid.
What does it-- What does it mean?
- You're stupid.
It means we can sit here
till the cows come home.
The Dutchman's hidin' out.
- No, Dutch Schultz don't
hide from nobody. Nobody.
- The heat is on.
-Joey's brother works for Dutch
Schultz, and he said the heat is on.
-Joey Faye's brother?
-W-W-What are they talking about?
-What he's talking about is--
-How'd he get a job workin' for Schultz?
- He caught on.
- How?
- I don't know. He caught on.
You know, Dutch Schultz noticed him.
Yeah, Schultz noticed him.
- Yeah, he noticed him.
Give me a cigarette.
- What, are you a forest fire?
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
the pleasure to present The Phantom...
- the world's greatest juggler.
- Yeah, the world's greatest jerk.
He has come to us directly from a tour
of the crown heads of Europe.
-And he will juggle, not one, not two...
-Yeah.
- not three...
- Yeah.
- but four balls.
- Oh, wow!
- Count 'em.
This was never before attempted
in the Bronx, New York, USA.
- Hey, you can join a circus now, Billy.
- Shut up, shut up. Look!
You can marry a seal or somethin'.
- It's all clear. Come on.
- That's him.
- That's Schultz.
- Oh, my God.
- He drives a black Packard.
- Come on. How do you know?
- He's got a gun.
- Everybody knows.
I'm tellin' ya.
It's very simple, but I think I've
got this whole thing under control.
- Well, then do it, counselor.
Pay 'em off.
- See that kid?
- Do it.
- What's he doing?
Hey, kid, come here.
- Come here.
- Arthur.
Arthur, can I just finish this point
I'm trying to make? It's very simple.
I know you don't like to talk
about money, but, uh...
I need about 1 0,000 more
to cover these guys.
I realize it seems like a lot.
$10,000 is a lot of money.
But these are the best attorneys
on the East Coast.
They have a lot of connections.
And if we do happen to go to trial--
- This doesn't go to trial.
- I know we're not going to trial.
Uh, I just--
A capable boy.
Arthur. Arthur, look,just look.
Can you give me an answer on this?
- You want an answer?
I'll give you an answer.
-Just answer.
How come you're the cheapest
lawyer I could find and you
still cost me all this dough?
-What?
-Irving, he always wants a little money.
Hey, Billy!
Did-- Did you see that?
He just met Dutch Schultz.
- What do ya got there?
- Hey. Now he's a big shot.
- Billy, how you doin'? What's goin' on?
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Let me look at it.
- You wanna see me double it?
- I'll take it.
- Let me-- Let me look at it.
- Wanna see me double it?
- No, I wanna look at it.
-Just,just give us a--
Hey, Billy!
Get your ass back here!
Come on, share the wealth.
Hey!
Arnold!
Arnold!
Arnold Garbage!
Arnold!
- You still got it?
- Yeah.
- Well, go get it.
- Wow. Does it work?
- Sure. I mean, I think it does.
I mean, you gotta
clean it up first.
- Is there bullets in it?
- No.
But see how the serial number's
been filed off there?
That's the sign that
it's a mob gun for sure.
- I'll give you three dollars.
- You have three dollars?
- Where did this come from?
- Dutch Schultz.
Now give me my change.
You lyin' son of a bitch.
Ma, I'm gonna go out now.
I'll be back in a little while.
The government's after him, cops are
after him. Everybody's after him.
And there he is, like he
ain't got a care in the world.
- So he noticed you. So what?
- So what?
You think a guy like me's
got a lot of choices?
You noticeJohn D. Rockefeller
offering me a job?
Or the Yankees asking me
to play shortstop?
No. This is it.
Becky, listen to me.
You don't understand about
a guy like Dutch Schultz.
He grew up around here.
He was a nobody,just like me.
But he had brains and he had guts.
And look at him now.
I-- I bet he's
the richest man in New York.
I mean, he's got the--
He's got the racetracks.
He's got the-- the nightclubs.
He controls the whole
liquor business.
He's gotten into
the numbers racket.
I mean, Dutch Schultz
is the number one--
And he noticed me.
I'm tellin' you, Becky, I-- I know
whatever happens to me in my life...
it's gonna have something
to do with Mr. Schultz.
- So what're you gonna do?
- Well, I'm gonna find him.
How're you gonna find him?
Don't worry. I'll find him.
- Hey, Harry, how ya doin'?
- Great. Right on schedule.
- 147.
- Okay, I'll take half.
- Yeah, Louie said that we--
- Great. Uh-huh.
- Oh, yeah.
- 273.
- Yeah. All right.
- You got it.
- Yeah.
What's this? What's goin' on?
Is this some kind of joke?
- Lulu.
- Listen, I'm telling you.
All you have to do is
what you're supposed to do
and stop dicking me around!
All you have to do
is make the deal, right?
United States of America
wants me to pay taxes.
- Fine, I'll pay the fucking taxes!
- It's not as simple as that, Arthur.
Look at this--
Stop with the papers
and listen to me a minute!
Look around you.
What do you see in this place?
I got 20 desks here, right? How many
men you see sittin' at these desks?
I got ten men, right? Those
empty desks mean anything to you?
Don't you understand every week
this goes on that I lose money...
I lose my banks, I lose my men
to those dago scumbags downtown.
Arthur, you don't seem to understand.
You don't hold all the cards
in this situation.
What do you mean I don't hold
all the cards in this situation?
I'm paying you an arm
and a leg, aren't I?
I'm paying off half the judges and the--
and the cops in this town.
What do you mean, I don't hold
the cards in this situation?
These are my favorite.
Arthur, this is the federal
government. Al Capone is serving
41 years for tax evasion.
We're gonna beat it,
but it's gonna take a lot of money
and it's gonna take a lot of time.
You understand what I'm saying?
Who are you?
- A kid with luck.
- Yeah?
- Well, we could use some.
- We haven't heard from George.
Yep.Joey's flaked with me.
Irving, come in here and close the door.
I want to talk to you.
No, there's no heavy.
It's not-- Don't worry about it.
Uh-huh. Okay. Bob's on his way
over here.Just a second.
- Bob? You there? Okay.
- 777.
- You forgot the coffee.
- Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.
- All right. That's it for today.
- Okay.
- Wipe the board clean.
- Right.
- You play the numbers, kid?
- No, sir.
- Good. You got a mother?
- Yes, sir.
Don't let her play
the numbers either.
But I'll tell you what.
I'll put you onto a sure thing.
- A horse?
- The world is numbers, not horses.
For instance, I'm gonna tell you how
much money you got in your pocket.
If I'm right, I win it.
If I'm wrong, I'm gonna match it,
and then you're gonna have double
what you had before.
- How's that?
- All right.
- All right. Now count your money.
- Don't let me see it.
- I know how much it is.
Good. Now double that
in your head and add three, okay?
- All right.
- All right. Now product that by five--
- Product? What?
- Multiply that by five...
subtract six and tell me
what you come up with.
- 279.
-Just lost 27 cents.
Yeah.
You might consider
the study of numbers.
Question: What's a 125th and 3rd?
A street corner.
There's a candy store.
It's one of our numbers houses.
Bitch.
Let's get out of here.
- Otto sent me.
- Nothin' I can do.
I work for them now.
You tell him that, hear?
You see what happens
when I try to do right?
You can all go to hell
as far as I'm concerned.
All white men together.
You tell him that too.
- Sounds like Jack Kelly.
- You see, kid?
I don't start these things.
I'm just this good-natured slob that
people think they can walk right over.
- You in a gang?
- No, sir.
- No?
How do you expect to learn anything?
I hire from gangs.
That's a training ground. Did you
ever hear of the Frog Hollow Gang?
- No, sir.
- Well, that was, uh, the most
famous of all the Bronx gangs.
That's where the original Dutch Schultz
came from. He was the toughest
street fighter that ever lived.
So they named me Dutch
Schultz in my neighborhood.
It was like an honorary thing.
Well, most of the gangs now
are just dumb kids mostly.
- Is that right?
- I think for the real training...
- Yeah?
-you gotta go right to the top.
- Supposed to see Bo Weinberg.
- Hey, Otto, you oughta listen
to this kid.
- You'll learn something.
- Thanks.
- What?
-Jack Kelly's gonna be at the Big Ben
barbershop tomorrow morning at 9:00.
Good. We'll let Bo handle this.
You give him a ring.
I tried to get Bo for two days.
I can't find him anywhere.
Where the hell is he?
He's supposed to be minding the store.
All right, kid, I want you
to be at Broadway and Nassau
at 9:00 in the morning.
- What do I do?
- What you do is you
don't ask any questions.
- Extra, extra! Get your Daily Mirror.
- Kid.
New in already.
Sunset paper wars.
- Mr. Berman.
- Is that the car?
- Yes, sir.
Extra, extra! Get your Daily Mirror.
New NRA upsets labor board.
- You sure that's him?
- Yes, sir.
- I think I'm gonna have
a talk with Mr. Kelly.
- Not yet. Wait till Bo gets here.
- Bo? I don't need Bo for this.
- Not now.
- I'm just gonna talk to him.
Gangland murder.
- Barbershop slaying.
- Here!
Gangland murder.
Barbershop slaying.
Grisly? There was
nothing grisly about it.
It was a professional piece of work.
Look at this.
It was neat, clean, end of story,
good-bye and good luck.
They're gonna think it was the guineas
or the coloreds that slit his throat.
They're never gonna think it was you.
So how did I know it was
the Dutchman right off the bat?
Oh, it's good to see you, Bo.
- We thought you was dead.
- Well, obviously I ain't.
You couldn't wait 24 hours?
You couldn't wait 24 hours for me to
come home and do this the right way?
- Believe me, it was done right.
- Where were you?
- I called around.
Nobody knows where you are.
- He was with some broad.
She was no broad.
This was a lady, a real lady.
Where'd you take this real lady
that's more important than business?
- Wherever it was,
she wasn't complaining.
- You could've called.
You could've checked in.
We never know where you are.
We never know what you're doing.
You're always with some dame.
We're running a business here.
Arthur's going on trial.
You're supposed to be in charge.
You got some complaints about
the way I'm running things, Otto?
All Otto is saying is if you're
gonna get shacked up, fine.
But we didn't know where you was,
we couldn't reach ya.
I think what he's trying to say is,
the way you handled it...
-just wasn't too
fuckin' smart, that's all.
- That's all.
Look at it this way, Arthur.
You're the one on the lam,
and I'm the one on the town.
Who would you rather be
at this moment? Know what I mean?
Pack up all my care 'n woe...
Here I go, singin'low...
Bye-bye, blackbird...
Where somebody waits for me...
Sugar's sweet, so is he...
Bye-bye, blackbird...
- Huh? All right.
- No one here...
- Can love and understand me...
- Hey, kid, take this to Mr. Schultz.
- I love it.
- Oh, what hard-luck stories...
They all hand me...
Make my bed and light the light...
I'll arrive late tonight...
Blackbird...
- Bye-bye...
- All right. Here we go. Ooh.
You didn't know I could do that,
did you? Did you?
Huh? Yeah, that's right.
What?
Bo Weinberg's
double-crossing us.
He met with one
of the other gangs.
He offered to cut them in
on our whole operation.
That's a lot of shit.
I can't believe that.
Meeting took place on the 10th.
Saratoga, the Piping Rock Casino.
The barbershop was on the 10th.
Why we couldn't reach him.
He said he was shacked up.
But he didn't say
who with or where.
No, no, no.
It doesn't make sense, Otto.
Why would he do
something like that?
Arthur, nobody thinks
you're gonna beat this rap.
Word on the street is that
you're as good as dead.
- Maybe Bo's just lookin' to the future.
- What are you talking about?
You know how far back we go. Come on.
I can't be-- What do you want?
Yes, sir. The bartender
asked me to give you this.
Thank you.
Good night, Mr. Weinberg.
- I'm just going to the bathroom.
- Okay.
Kid?
- Huh?
- Kid.
- Mr. Weinberg.
- Dutchman got you workin' late?
- Yes, sir.
- Where you from, kid?
- The Bronx. Bathgate Avenue.
Jerome Avenue.
- Say hello to a friend
of mine from the Bronx.
- Hello.
M-Mr. Weinberg, this is $20.
Yeah. Get some sleep, kid.
Thanks! Thanks a lot.
You know what a loyal man
is worth these days, kid?
His weight in gold.
You remember that.
He lied to me, Otto.
He lied to me.
I will take him down,
and that is a sacred vow.
Arthur, you have to be careful.
Bo has many friends.
He was the best, smart.
I never had to tell Bo
to do anything twice.
I would say it one time, and bang,
it was done, and it was done right.
- Hey! Anybody in there?
- I promise you, kid, it was done right.
- You get high marks for this.
- Hey!
- It's the fire inspector.
- Must be payday. I'll talk to him.
- Come on! Open up in there.
-Come on! Open up! Open up the door!
-He had balls. Nobody had balls like Bo.
- Lemme talk to the manager.
- He's not here. Come back later.
- I remember one time.
- All right.Just take it easy.
The guineas wanted him
to take out one of their guys.
And you know what he done?
- Calm down.
- He put on a cop's uniform--
- W-Where's the manager?
- Hey, hey, where you goin'?
- Who are these guys?
- Hey, you can't come in here.
This is a private meeting.
What's the matter, pal?
You got a problem, huh? Huh?
You want your payoff, huh?
I'll give you a payoff!.
Get this load of shit
out of here.
Fuckin' fire inspector.
Now, what's next, the mailman?
I can't take it, Otto.
I can't take it when it's
all over the street.
We're gonna have to get Hines
to deal with this. It's gonna cost.
Do what you have to do. Boys,
if I'm gonna have to go to trial...
I'm not going to trial
in the city.
I want it in the boondocks.
Oh, Bo...
what have you done to me?
Close the door.
Mr. Berman. Mr. Berman, w-what are
we gonna do? He killed that man.
Forget it. You didn't see anything,
you didn't hear anything.
Nothing happened.
Even think about it again, you're
as good as dead. You understand?
Now, listen to me, kid.
You're the upcoming generation.
Things are gonna be different for you.
You need different skills
from these guys.
Be streamlined, not so
much fire in the street.
When that happens, if you're lucky,
you may not have to kill anyone.
What that means is, no one
will have to kill you. Let's go.
Get the lights.
Here's your salary-- $12.
Now this $50 is my money.
Want you to buy a new pair
of pants, nice jacket...
shirt with a tie,
pair of shoes with laces.
It's a personal embarrassment
to me to see the way you dress.
I want you to get a valise
to put the clothes in, and buy
something nice for your mother.
- Well, where am I going?
- Mr. Schultz is having
a trial coming up...
and we have decided...
that he'll get a better deal
if the trial takes place upstate.
Is that all right with you?
- And I want you to buy a book to read.
- What do I need a book for?
Are you gonna do what I tell ya
or give me a hard time?
- Mr. Berman?
- Yes?
- Who is this man you're meeting?
You wanna stay in
the crime business, kid...
you gotta stop asking
all these questions.
His name is Hines.
He's a district leader
for Tammany Hall.
He's on our payroll.
Takes care of problems like this.
- So, Otto, you're looking good.
- You too.
I'm telling you, these guys
ain't like anybody you ever met.
They want something,
boom, like that, it gets done.
And the money. I swear, you've never
seen money like this in your life.
- So what?
How much money can you spend?
- That ain't the point.
Let me tell you.
Money can do anything.
I bet you never had
anything in your life that, that
somebody else didn't wear first.
All right. Get me a--
Yeah, three for me.
Want one?
Here. Get yourself
something nice.
- Come on, Arnold, we're having a party.
- Where?
- Where do you think?
-Just don't break anything this time.
- Don't worry.
Hey. Hello.
- Mr. Klein!
- Billy!
- How are ya?
- Lookin' good.
- Mr. Rosen.
- Hello.
- Lookin' good!
- How are you?
- Very good.
Girls, girls, girls.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hello, Billy.
- Hey, Mrs. Thomas.
- Hello, Billy.
- Ah, Billy, don't you look swell.
Thank you. Hi, Ma.
I got a job. Thing is,
uh, it's in the country.
Upstate.
It's just for the summer.
Ma?
This is for you.
Billy Behan, look at you.
The richest man
on Bathgate Avenue.
- You're bad. You're--
- Let's go to work.
- Irving.
- Miss, this way.
What? What's the matter?
- Bo, what's going on?
- Come on.
- Good evening, Bo.
- Leave her out of this, Dutch.
This must be love.
- What is your name, miss?
- Lola. Her name is Lola.
Oh, that can't be.
I know all the girls named Lola.
You must be Arthur.
Kid, go see what he's doin'.
He don't have no respect.
Go see if she's all right.
Do what I told you.
Just go see if she's all right.
You know what I'm
talkin' about, don't you?
Hmm? I mean, you don't care
about what's dead, do you?
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now,
except for a few details, he's dead.
Can you understand that?
You can forget about
the dead, can't you?
I think you've forgotten
already, haven't you?
Well?
I'm waiting.
It's either a yes or a no.
- I-- I--
- What?
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
What?
- Yes.
- Oh.
That's too bad.
That's too bad for Bo.
Because if I thought you loved him,
I might've changed my mind.
Okay, kid...
take the lady
to her apartment.
Don't let her make
any phone calls.
Although, I don't
think she'll try.
She'll pack some things.
Stay with her until I come back.
Somebody will call you up
on the house phone to bring her down.
You got it?
Have you ever seen
such a terrible night?
Good evening, Mrs. Preston.
Drew?
- Drew?
- I have to pee, Harvey.
I thought you were out
for the evening.
You all right? Drew.
Now, tell me what you've gone
and done. You didn't ditch him?
- I thought you were so wild about him.
- Harvey, I don't want to talk about it.
It's perfectly all right with me.
I never could stand him anyway.
- I thought you said that you were--
- Listen, I'll be going away for a while.
You can't mean it, going away.
Where? For how long?
We're supposed to be going
to the Willets' this weekend.
To say nothing of dinner
tomorrow evening with Dwight...
which was your idea to begin with,
if I'm not mistaken.
Darling, you'll just have
to make excuses for me.
There are certain proprieties
to be maintained. You are my wife,
after all. Or have you forgotten?
Harvey, please.
What's the point of making a fuss?
There's a certain limit. I mean,
a bit of scandal isn't the point.
But sooner or later,
you're gonna get in over your head.
And then what will you do?
I'll expect you to come to the rescue,
like you always do.
Get me another drink,
would you, please?
If that's my gangster,
tell him to wait.
Mrs. Preston,
you got a first name?
- Drew.
- Drew?
You're the first Drew I ever met.
You're the first Dutch.
All right, we have 28 days
before the trial.
That means 28 days
to show these folks...
that Dutch Schultz
is one of them.
Starting off, we call him
by his real name, Mr. Flegenheimer.
Everything is quiet and polite.
We're plain folks just like them
who got the government on their backs.
They understand that.
We don't get into fights.
No feeling up the chambermaids.
From now on, you eat
with your mouth closed.
- This is horseshit.
- Another thing, no foul language...
no booze, no dames,
no fighting.
It's different from the city.
These are decent people.
Make sure you act decent.
- Where's the book?
- Huh?
- I told you to bring a book.
Either you listen or you go back
to the Bronx. Not some kind of picnic.
Take this to Mrs. Preston.
- Is that coffee?
- Yes.
Thank you.
I once chanced to meet Alvin Pinkus
around with Pretty Boy Floyd.
- He always said banks was best.
- Yeah, look where he is now.
- He did all right for a while.
- Think about it, going for the dough,
the one place that's under lock and key.
- You gotta be stupid.
- Yeah, but--
- Stay with the car, Lulu.
- You got anything
to tell me about the girl?
- Her name is Drew Preston.
You want to explain to me
what she's doin' here?
We got a trial comin'--
She's the kid's governess.
The properties are being observed.
- The what?
- The properties.
- Wait a minute.
There. You look handsome.
That's a compliment.
- Please, come in.
- Thank you. It's very nice
to make your acquaintance.
- May I introduce
my business manager, Mr. Berman.
- Mr. Berman.
- My pleasure.
And Mrs. Preston, who is
the governess of my prodigy.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I'd like to open
a checking account for $10,000.
- And the rest in a savings account.
- Of course.
Excuse me a moment.
I'll get my head accountant
to take care of the paperwork.
Honey, you are looking at the patron
saint of the boondocks. When this--
Arthur, if I make a tiny
criticism, do you promise
not to get all sulky and pout?
- What?
- It's ''protege.''
- What did I say?
Prodigy.
It means ''child genius.''
Thank you very much, Mr. Flegenheimer.
We don't often get famous people
in our little town.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Look, if it's all right with you...
- Mr. Berman will stay here
and work out the details.
- I'm sure there'll be no problem.
Say, young fella, what's the younger
generation reading these days?
Ah, yes. What's your name, son?
Billy, uh, Bathgate.
With youngsters like this, we don't
have to worry about the future of
this country, do we, Mrs. Preston?
No, we don't.
- I hope to see you soon.
- Yeah, right. Come here.
Let me see that, will you?
What do you got there?
- What is this? Was this your idea?
- Don't look at me, boss.
- You? This was your brainstorm?
- Yeah.
I love it. What'd I tell you?
The kid's all right.
He's my prodigy. I know how to pick
my words. You're my prodigy!
Get in the car, will you?
We ain't got all day.
- Come on, Mickey, I got an inspiration.
- Yes, sir.
- Inspiration, right?
That's correct.
- What kind of church is this?
- It's Catholic.
They put a lot of work
into this place.
G-58.
I-17.
- G-51 .
- Bingo!
And especially Mr. Schultz
for so generously donating...
a special cash prize of $25.
All righty, ten chickens
and the two crates.
Bid 25 cents, anyone.
25, now 30, now 5, son--
I'll give you $1 00 for the chickens,
and how much you want for the farm?
You know, I try to talk to him,
but it's impossible.
- Sometimes he listens,
and sometimes he won't listen at all.
- Who's that?
Looks like he's goin'
for the farm vote.
I hope this helps for now.
If you need more later...
I can't promise,
but I'll do what I can, Mr., uh, uh--
- Chambers.
- Chambers.
- Thank you, sir.
God bless you
for what you're doin', sir.
Mickey! Who's next?
- Yeah, uh, well, Dixie's here.
- What are you doin' here?
- Hello, Arthur.
- Come here. Give me some more coffee.
Why aren't you in the city? What
are you coming up here like this for?
- Arthur, we need to talk.
- Why didn't you call me up?
I didn't want to tell you this
on the telephone.
- Say what?
- The government
turned down the offer.
- So double it.
- No. They won't settle.
It's the prosecutor.
- He's determined to go to trial.
- Ah, shit. So we'll
take care of him too.
- No, it's no soap. It can't be bought.
- He said that?
- What do you want?
- I got your coffee.
Put it on the table. Why are you always
listening to what you shouldn't
be listening to?
Will you get out of here? Will you
go upstairs and tell Mrs. Preston...
to take you to a museum
or something?
Go on! Get out of here!
Go to the zoo!
Come on. Do something useful.
I need the suite.
Mrs. Preston?
Mr. Schultz said
I should wake you.
He said he needs the room, so we should
go to a museum or something.
Mrs. Preston, I don't think
this was such a good idea.
Mr. Schultz didn't
say anything about this.
One of the things about being in a gang
is you gotta follow orders.
So far, everything
they asked me to do, I done it.
- Did it!
- I mean it, Mrs. Preston!
I think we oughta go back.
Mrs. Preston?
Mrs. Preston!
Mrs. Preston!
Mrs. Preston, you all right?
How was it when Bo died?
Could you tell me, please?
You got him? Hold onto him.
Take care of my girl, kid.
Don't let him hurt her.
Get her away from him
before he hurts her.
Do you hear me?
Promise me.
- Say it!
- I promise.
Oh, my God.
Oh-- Oh, God.
Mrs. Preston!
Mrs. Preston!
- Did he really ask you to protect me?
- Yes.
Strange.
I mean, that he would think that
I couldn't take care of myself.
- And you promised him you would?
- Yes.
- You always keep your promises?
- Uh-huh.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yes. Yes.
She's a very lucky girl.
What is that supposed to mean?
They remember Bo.
I remember too. What he did,
he brought upon himself.
I am upset too.Just because I don't
go around talking about it--
- They liked Bo.
- Mm-hmm.
They don't appreciate his
lady friend's presence here.
That is their hard luck, isn't it?
What do you think the odds are
I'll beat this rap?
- I wouldn't bet on you.
- Why not?
- We come up here...
take the time,
the trouble, the effort...
to set things right
so that you make a good impression...
and you bring along this broad.
All right.
You made your point.
What?
- She was there when Bo got it.
- That is correct.
She never should have got on that boat
and she never should have got off.
When the time comes...
I'll smack her around a little, and
that's all it'll take, I promise you.
Just don't fall
in love with her, Arthur.
Boy, you are some picnic tonight.
I said,
don't fall in love with her.
- Who's out there?
- Nobody.
Jesus Christ.
You scared the shit out of me.
It's nothing.
The citizens of Onondaga
are hard-working people...
who usually
get the short end of the stick.
But our forefathers have dealt you
a couple of cards in your favor.
And you people know
the law isn't nothing...
but what the people say it is.
And I have great confidence
that the people in this town...
know that I hold the same virtues
of right and wrong.
And if I just may
wax poetic for a moment--
M-M-Mrs. Preston,
you gotta be careful.
Otto saw us.
I mean it, Mrs. Preston. You g--
You gotta watch out with these people.
Why?
They don't like it for anybody
to have something on them.
Do I have something
on them? Do I?
You were on the boat.
That makes you a danger to them.
If I have something on them,
then so do you.
Yeah. You're right.
If I don't catch on, then I
will have something on them.
If Mr. Schultz
decides against me, that's it.
There's nothing
anyone can do.
Let me tell you something
about your Mr. Schultz.
He is a very ordinary man.
Now you've got something on me.
- Who's the better shooter?
- Irving.
- Why?
- He got 'em all in there.
Nothing's wasted.
- Nah. This ain't ladies' embroidery.
It don't have to be neat.
If you got the time to set it up...
and you need a clean hit,
you send Irving.
But if you're in a tight spot,
you want Lulu standing next to you.
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom.
It's all over in a couple of seconds.
This is about as far from where
I come from as you can get.
- Where's that?
- The Bronx. Bathgate Avenue.
- We live in a tenement.
- Who's we?
My mom and me.
She works in a laundry.
Gets four dollars a week.
You probably
spend more than that for lunch.
Maybe you don't appreciate
the position you're in.
What position is that?
- You're Mr. Schultz's girl.
- No, I'm not his girl.
He's my gangster.
Besides...
you're the one who's
been looking after me.
So far, you seem
to be doing all right on your own.
Meaning? What?
Meaning? Tell me.
Come on. Tell me.
- Look, because--
- Yes?
Because Mr. Schultz
is a pushover for blondes.
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I read it in the paper.
I don't read the papers.
How y-- How you supposed to know
everything you need to know...
if you don't read the paper?
What is it I need to know?
Maybe if you don't work for a living,
you don't need to know anything.
Some of us are trying
to learn a trade.
We have to be up
on the latest developments.
Here's the latest development.
- Arthur, do you renounce Satan?
- I do renounce him.
- And all his works?
- Yes.
- And all his pomps?
- Yes.
- And all his allurements?
- Yes.
Mr. Luciano, please place
your hand in position.
As I said before,
Mr. Luciano--
- Thanks very much. Thanks.
- You're welcome, sir.
You know, I'm just honored
to enter the Catholic Church...
on a ticket
with such a man as yourself.
I appreciate your coming.
Schultz, where's your associate,
Bo Weinberg? Is he here today?
- I'm sorry. He couldn't make it.
- Oh, that's too bad.
I never met him, but I hear that he's
a man of character, a man to respect.
Yeah. I'm sure he would like
to have met you too.
I'm making a party later,
and I'd be happy if you could--
Nah. I wish I could,
but I gotta get back to the city.
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.
Mr. Luciano,
thank you so much for coming.
You honor us with your presence.
Where were you?
Oh, is that where you went?
Yes, a friend told me.
Big difference.
- You're late. You were supposed
to be here this morning.
- It's a long drive, Otto.
- Take off your hat.
- Where's Dutch? I ain't got all night.
Uh, excuse me. Mr. President,
where were ya? This is a big day for me.
Did you tell Julie Mr. Luciano himself
showed up here today?
You were supposed
to be here a long time ago,Julie.
- You're lucky I'm here at all.
-Julie, nice to see ya. How's the drive?
Father McInerney, I'd like you to meet
Mr.Julie Martin, my business associate.
- Ah, and what do you do, Mr. Martin?
- Mr. Martin is the president...
of the Metropolitan Restaurant
and Cafeteria Owners Association.
Well, sir, you are
in the finest restaurant in town.
- That's your problem.
- You're in the country now,Julie.
- Mind your manners.
- Yeah. All right. Now tell me why...
you got me to drive all the way up here
so I can get out of the goddamn country.
You got a big mouth, you know that,
Mr. President?
I've got some business to discuss with
this gentleman, so if you'll excuse me.
Otto.
I earned, I earned.
The money I paid, expenses.
What costs
are you talking about,Julie?
I didn't dream up the protection rackets
so you could steal from me.
- You didn't dream up nothing.
I made the rackets. I run 'em for ya.
- All right.
Don't raise your voice to me. I'm
right here. I'm not across the street.
You've been yelling at me all night.
-Hey, I'm the one with the baseball bats.
-Yeah.
-I'm the one who
throws the stink bombs.
-Yeah.
-I'm the one who squeezed two million
dollars out of those restaurants
last year.
-Yeah.
-Me. Alone.
-Don't you feel obliged to make it good?
-Don't I feel obliged
to make what good?
-The $50,000 that Otto says
you're light.
- Otto's wrong. Otto's wrong.
- Otto's never wrong.
- He says you've been skimming,Julie.
- Skimming? Skimming, huh?
- Yeah.
- No, not skimming.
Money that I'm entitled to.
- You're entitled to $50,000 worth?
- You're damn right I am.
-He's entitled to my $50,000?
-Yeah. Let me tell you something, pally.
- You tell me something, pally.
- I got every maitre d' in the city...
going to his knees when I walk
in the door because of who I am, got it?
Let me explain something
to you in plain English.
Oh, my God.
Kid, see if you can find the shell.
My eyes aren't what they used to be.
Arthur, you killed that man
right in front of me.
He stole $50,000
from me, counselor.
I'm a member of the New York State Bar.
He does this thing. I'm standing
right here.
Calm down, Dixie.
Nobody heard a thing.
- Everybody's asleep.
- I was seen with him at the reception.
He left right after that. Mickey
drove him. We have witnesses. Relax.
Relax? He shoots a gun in the man's
mouth in the middle of a sentence.
He wants me to relax?
Lulu, take Dixie to his room.
Lock him in.
- I have to walk into
a courtroom tomorrow.
- You'll get over it.
Kid, go downstairs, bring up
the elevator. Make sure nobody sees ya.
- What's the matter, Irving?
- It's not coming out.
- What the hell are you doing?
- What's going on?
- Shh.
- Oh.
- Be quiet. Go back to sleep, okay?
Listen. Nothing has happened.
Do what I tell you. Don't ask about it.
Don't say a word to Mr. Schultz
about it. Forget it.
Now I've got something on you.
Hello, operator.
This is Mr. Flegenheimer. There's
been an accident, and I need a doctor.
Sure, I'll hold on.
Hello, Doctor. This is Mr. Flegenheimer.
We've had a little accident...
and I'd appreciate it if you could
come over and, uh, take a look.
Thank you. No, no, no.
It's nothing serious.
About how long that--
will that take? That's fine.
That's just fine.
Room, uh, 3 5, Terminal Hotel.
Jesus, Lu, you don't have
to break his fucking nose.
Take your hands away. Come on.
Just put your head down.
Let me do the work, all right?
That's good.Just relax.
A little more over there.
That's it.
That's a good boy.
Just let it drip there.
All right, Irv.
Give him a handkerchief and get him up.
Here. Up you go.
Now, listen. You don't have
to worry about the Dutchman.
I take care of my own, okay?
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
Don't you think twice aboutJulie
Martin. He tried to take what was mine.
But you I love.
And these guys.
And I would do anything for them.
They know my word is my bond.
They know it's better
than the Prudential life insurance.
Look at this--
not a complaint out of him.
Is that something?
Is that a trouper?
He takes the good and the bad.
He takes all.
Very good.
He wants to be in the gang.
All right, kid.
You're in the gang.
- Put the heavy ones up front.
- Otto wants to see you.
Right over here. See that?
- You're cheatin'. You're cheatin'.
- Otto wants to see you.
Come in.
Put some ice on that.
Close the door.
I want to talk to you about Mrs. Preston.
I think she has seen something in you.
I wonder if it's
the same thing I see.
I-- I don't know.
I-I don't know what she sees.
Mrs. Preston
has got it in her head...
that she wants to be in court
to see the show.
Now, can you imagine
what's gonna happen when
the newspapers get a hold of her?
- Mr. Schultz is a married man.
- Mr. Schultz is married?
We're all married men.
We've got mouths to feed.
We've got families to support.
This has been a tough
son of a bitch for all of us.
Now, listen.
I want Mrs. Preston out of here...
and I want her
out of here fast.
She can go to Saratoga, see the races.
She can go to Lake George.
She can go to Hong Kong.
I don't care where she goes.
But I want her out of here, and
I'm depending on you to get her out.
- Do you want me to leave?
- The way Mr. Berman explained it--
I don't care about Mr. Berman.
Forget Mr. Berman.
- There'll be a lot of reporters there.
- Is that what you want? Because if
that's what you want, then I wanna
hear it from you.
- He said they're gonna ask questions.
- Do you want me to leave?
- It's for-- It's for your sake.
- I'm asking you a question, Billy.
Do you want me to leave?
No, I don't.
It's polite to knock, Arthur.
Am I missing anything?
I've decided Mr. Berman is right. I'll
be going to Saratoga for the races...
but I'll be taking Billy with me.
Is that all right with you, hmm?
I asked you a question, kid.
I just wanna tell you. It now only
appears you're hurting yourself.
You know what I'm--
Now everybody's happy.
- Mr. Schultz!
- Mr. Schultz. Mr. Schultz,
you worried about the trial?
No, I'm not worried.
I've been in worser spots than this.
- Now, Mr. Schultz--
- How does it feel to be
public enemy number one?
That's something you made up
for the papers. I'm no public enemy.
- So what are you?
- Public benefactor.
- Well, then, how is it...
that you were arrested 1 1 times
before the age of 1 9?
- Those are all cases
of mistaken identity.
- Every single one of'em.
- Is this a case of mistaken identity?
- No. This is minor stuff.
Income tax evasion.
- Are you sure about that?
- Are you serious?
- Mr. Schultz.
That's right. I'm no gorilla.
I never killed nobody, and I never
caused nobody to get killed.
- Mr. Schultz.
- Mr. Schultz.
- That's all the questions we can take.
-Thank-- Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Uh, what about the money trail?
- What about all the money he made?
- Mr. Schultz, what about--
All rise.
Court is in session.
Please be seated.
Listen, I'll handle this.
Mr. Berman told me Mr. Schultz
owns a piece of this hotel.
- He said they've
taken care of everything.
- Absolutely.
Welcome back, Mrs. Preston.
It's good to see you again.
Thank you, Charles.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Preston.
- Good afternoon.
- Mrs. Preston.
Ah, we're always delighted
to see you, Mrs. Preston.
- Hello, Francoise.
- I've kept your suite available,
of course.
- And if you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.
- Thank you.
- Mr.--
- Bathgate, William Bathgate.
- Mr. Bathgate, your room is just there.
And Mrs. Preston--
Good night, Billy.
Good night.
I won't tell him if you won't.
It ain't funny, Mrs. Preston.
You think Mr. Schultz is an ordinary man.
You're wrong. He's not.
He's a maniac.
This-- what we're doin'-- this
is how people get themselves killed.
- And what way is that?
- They don't stop to calculate the odds.
They don't stop to think.
- Can you calculate the odds?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I used to.
I-I used to think I had a charmed life.
I used to think I was one in a million.
I had my wits.
Whatever happened, I would be fine.
But now I--
I've lost my wits, uh,
I've lost my place.
Listen to me.
You're smarter than he is
and braver.
And you'll live longer
if you're not afraid.
Oh, my poor Billy Bathgate.
You made a promise
to protect me.
I'm not making it
easy for you, am I?
No, ma'am, you're not.
Are you awake?
Hmm? Can you hear me?
Yes.
- I'm having breakfast with the gang.
- Oh, yeah?
- What?
- No, no, my gang.
Here, I've written
it all down for you.
Meet me later
at the track.
- Hello?
- Where were you last night, the two of you?
We called. There was nobody there.
Mr. Schultz doesn't like that kind of thing.
-Is there something
I oughta know about?
-We had dinner at the Brook Club.
Uh, M-Mrs. Preston met some friends,
silly people, nothing.
Not for you, kid. Make sure she's at the
track, in her box, by the third race.
- Box number 50.
- Wh-Why? What for?
Don't you know when somebody's
trying to look out for you?
Oh, one more thing.
You don't have to sit
in her lap. Got it?
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
Operator, can you get me
the Savoy Plaza Hotel in New York City?
Savoy Plaza? I'd like
to speak to Mr. Harvey Preston.
Mr. Preston, you don't know me.
I'm calling from Saratoga.
- Can I have a clubhouse ticket, please?
- Yes, sir.
Yes. I'll be right back.
- Fifty. Fifty. Fifty.
- Right.
- Thirty-five cents.
- Won't you keep the change?
- One, two, six, six.
- Where are you sitting?
Are you sitting up behind us...
- where you were last year?
- Thank you very much.
-Johnny, let's go over here.
- Over here!
- Fifty dollars!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- A good horse?
- I think we made the right choice.
Uh-huh. Well, I did see.
I saw him last, uh, last year.
Uh, he took the race
and won by at least three lengths.
Beautiful, beautiful.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
- Hey, hey, hey. Come here.
- Harriet, over here!
- What?
- I want you to take these flowers--
- Come over here and see us!
- Mr. Wilson.
- Phil.
- Good afternoon, ladies.
...and then Tyler and Jack--
...all of a sudden,just popped up
right there in the Atlantic Ocean.
- No!
- Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Something's gone wrong.
- I think you're
in a lot of danger right now.
- Don't be so melodramatic, Billy.
- Mrs. Preston, this is not a joke.
They're trying--
- Look. Aren't they the most beautiful
things you've ever seen?
So, who do you like
in the next race, Charlotte?
Um--
Flowers for Mrs. Preston.
No, look at these.
Come on.
Come on, Royal Anna.
Billy, there was something
I wanted to tell you.
- Do you remember that man
who came to church?
- Which man?
The one at Mr. Schultz's baptism,
the one he respects so much.
- Yes. Luciano.
- I've met him before.
- Where? With Bo?
- Mm-hmm. I was drunk.
- Did you ever tell Mr. Schultz?
- No.
You think I should have?
Go, Royal Anna!
Go! Come on!
Go, Royal Anna!
Go! Go! Come on! Go!
- Damn.
- I won! I won!
- I'm gonna go bet.
- No! I'll do it. You stay here.
All right.
Put $50 to win on Phantom Fox.
- Satisfied?
- Don't get up.
Don't leave until I get back.
- What if I have to pee?
- Then I'll bring you back a can.
He just got out
of the hospital ten days ago.
I love you, Mrs. Preston.
Carter!
Hello, Drew, dear.
- What's the rush?
- Oh, I-- I thought I saw Irving.
You did.
I hope so.
- Oh, Drew.
- Oh, hello.
Excuse me.
- Carter.
- Drew.
Darling!
Harvey. Harvey!
What--
What are you doing here? Harvey!
For God's sake,
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I got the damnedest telephone call.
- What the hell's going on?
- Oh, it's the husband.
Come on.
- You should have told us.
- How was I to know?
- What's this all about?
- It's the husband.
Come on.
- What's with the state troopers?
- I don't know. The guy's a big shot.
The kind of stuff
big shots do, I guess.
You didn't see this coming?
Sure, like I saw
it coming with Lulu.
I don't get it. She must
have figured out something.
Nah. She didn't know nothing.
She seem like she was scared to you?
Uh-uh. She's not
like ordinary people.
She's not scared of anything.
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yes, we have, Your Honor.
Will the defendant please rise?
As to the charges, how do you find
the defendant, guilty or not guilty?
We, the members of the jury,
find the defendant not guilty.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Oh, Irving, how--
- Yes, I'm good.
- Hi.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Is Mr. Schultz here?
Yeah. He's upstairs. You know, I'm sorry
about what happened to your nose.
- Oh, don't worry.
- It was an accident.
- It's all right. It's all right.
Mr. Schultz is waiting
for you upstairs.
- He wants me to go up there?
- Yeah. Have a good time.
Hey. Look who's here.
Close the door, will ya?
I'd like a little privacy.
- Did she say anything?
- Who?
- Who?
- Mrs. Preston?
Yeah, I think
that's the lady's name.
Yeah, she said
she liked you...
very much.
- She said you, uh--you have class.
- She said that?
Well, who knows?
In a better world,
in another time--
- What?
- They've issued another indictment.
This time it's Dewey.
It's the state.
What is it with this state income tax?
And if I beat that, what's next?
City tax? And after that,
Borough of the Bronx tax?
And then Bathgate Avenue tax?
It's not fair, Otto. It's not fair.
We're gonna wait this out in New Jersey.
I'm gonna get in touch with Hines.
- And we're gonna work something out.
- What does a man have to do, tell me...
to be deserving of a break, to be able
to reap the fruits of his labor?
I'm gonna get Dewey.
I am gonna get that bastard.
You can't kill Dewey. It's too big.
Not some fire inspector--
I wanna know where he lives.
I wanna know what time
he comes out of his house.
- You gotta arrange with the gangs.
You cannot just go ahead--
- Otto, Otto, Otto!
Don't you ever tell me
what I can or cannot do, Otto.
You work for me.
You do as I tell you.
Is that clear?
All right. We'll be moving across
the river to New Jersey for a while.
- Remember Hines?
- From Tammany Hall. The, uh, fixer.
Right now, he's our last chance.
There are 1 7 $1 ,000 bills
in there.
You tell him we're waiting for an answer
at the Palace Chophouse in Newark.
You should have seen him
at the height of his power,
when he had a grip on things.
He was a king back then.
You never saw
the real Dutch Schultz.
Terrible thing when the money won't
flow. I'd hoped never to see the day.
Nothing makes me sadder
than to refuse such a generous offer.
Mr. Hines,
we need your help with Dewey.
Mr. Dewey is a prosecutor
who wants to be president.
There is nothing I can do.
You tell Mr. Schultz that
the business between us is over.
- I'm through with him.
- Mr. Schultz ain't gonna like this.
He's always been very generous
with you. He deserves--
He deserves nothing.
That son of a bitch.
That goddamn son of a bitch.
What does he mean he won't
take my money after all these years?
Suddenly my money's not good enough
for him? He's a nothing, that scumbag.
I'll take that money, and I'll stick it
in his teeth. I'll make him eat it.
- Forget about him.
We got other problems to worry about.
- Don't tell me to forget about him!
You promised me Hines.
You told me he'd take care of us.
And now this?
Is this how good
your Dutchman is these days?
Now, listen.
You don't worry about Dewey, all right?
Dewey is as good as gone.
- You made an agreement with Luciano.
- I don't need his advisement on this.
He drove hundreds of miles
to stand up for you in that church.
He didn't have the decency to stay there
long enough to break bread with me.
- I don't trust that man, all right?
- The man is sympathetic.
Dewey's everybody's problem.
Luciano knows the Dutchman
gets knocked down, he's next.
Meantime, I'm the one
that's in the frying pan!
Now, let me tell you for the final time.
I will take Dewey out.
And Luciano and his men will thank me
for it. Listen very carefully.
They will come,
and they will thank me for it.
Mrs. Preston told me something
about him, about Luciano.
She said that she thought
she had seen him somewhere before.
What are you talking about?
She said--
She said she was drunk.
She didn't remember much,
but she was pretty sure it was him.
She said she was with Bo.
You hear this kid?
This is what I'm talking about.
This is why I say
that he is my prodigy.
What else she tell you, huh?
What else went on with the two of you?
- All right. All right.
- What? It's all right.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- He's a-- kicked a kid.
- I know. I'm calm.
- Get up.
- What did I do?
- That's for not telling me sooner, kid.
- I tried. I didn't have the chance.
You should have come
to me right away. Even so...
I didn't hear the rest of you give me
the word on our downtown compadre.
- Come on. That's not fair.
- Shut the fuck up.
Lulu, you're ugly and you're dumb
and that's the truth of you.
Otto, get Dixie on the phone.
I want him over here right away.
Right. Fix me a rye.
Make it straight up.
That conniving dago scum.
Can you tell me...
how you know what he respects?
Me, I like something, I tell ya.
I don't like something,
I tell ya that.
Ya cross me, I fuckin' kill ya.
Everything is clear.
Everything is aboveboard
and honest, right, Irving?
I see the whole world
ganging up on me.
I see the man who takes me
into his church...
the man who makes me
his brother and embraces me,
kisses me on the cheek.
He's the same man
who turns my Bo against me.
Is that love or is that
the Sicilian kiss of death?
I don't care
how many DAs come after me.
Whatever has to be done, I'll do.
They think I am finished,
but I will show them.
Come on, boys. Give me a smile.
Dutchman's making a comeback.
What is this?
I asked for scotch.
- Can't you do one damn thing right?
- But you just told me--
No, finally I'm fed up with you.
You're fired.
- What?
- I don't wanna tell you twice.
- Get out of here.
- Why?
You know why I'm firing you?
'Cause you always wanna
know the reasons for things.
Always asking questions.
Always poking your nose into things
that don't concern you.
-But y--you said--
-Always interrupting. And most of all...
I'm sick of the sight of you.
- Mr. Berman--
- I don't wanna hear anymore.
Now, beat it.
You can't fire me.
I work for Mr. Schultz.
Mr. Schultz does the hiring;
I do the firing.
Now, here's your severance pay.
Get lost.
What's the matter with you? Can't you
get it through that thick Irish skull...
of yours
that we don't want you?
None of us. We never did.
Now, there goes a kid
with luck.
Get him, Charlie.
Don't say a fucking thing.
Hey, what's going on out there?
Somebody call the police!
- What are they doing?
- Come on.
- All right. Move it.
- Hey!
- Come on.
- Hey!
- Go, go, go!
Get down.
Dixie?
What the hell
did you bring him here for?
Dixie, what's going on?
What's the matter with you guys?
You double-crossed him.
You sold him out, you son of a bitch!
Bravo, kid.
- Lucky, will you tell these guys
to get rid of this guy?
- What's the matter, Dixie?
- He was at the Chophouse.
He's a witness.
- Sorry, kid.
What are you gonna do when he
crosses you like he did Mr. Schultz?
- Don't worry. He won't.
- No? Why don't you ask him
about the money?
- What money?
- They were sitting on five,
six million in cash.
We didn't come across anything like
that kind of money, did we, Dixie?
Lucky, we've been all through this
before. They were broke.
They didn't have the money
for payoffs or for salaries.
- What about the safe, huh?
- Otto Berman had a safe.
I took a look inside.
It was empty. There was nothing in it.
That's not true. I saw it.
I saw it. It was full of cash.
He's lying.
You gonna listen to some punk kid?
He's nothing. He's nobody.
All he ever did was to sweep up.
- They never let him near the money.
- How come Mr. Berman gave me this?
Here, here.
This is a lot of money.
Dixie, if you're
holding out on me...
it wouldn't be the right way
to start a business relationship.
Maybe we ought to have a little talk.
Charlie, Pete.
Lucky.
- Lucky, I-I told you the whole truth.
- Don't worry, Dixie.
This won't take long.
What am I gonna do with you, huh?
You got brains. You got guts.
I like that.
But Dixie's right. You know too much.
So what am I gonna do?
But maybe I know a few things too.
For instance...
I know where Bathgate Avenue is.
I know where you buy your cigarettes.
And I know the laundry
where your mother works.
So I guess it all evens out,
don't it?
Take care of yourself, kid.
Can I have my money?
Sure. Why not?
I'll be looking in on you
from time to time...
just to see
how you're getting along.
Remember that.
Hey, kid, you want a ride?
No, thanks. I'll walk.
