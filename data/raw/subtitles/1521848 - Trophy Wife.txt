"My friend the squirrel
was there this morning.
"He gave me a wink.
"A Glance ...
"I told him tomorrow."
See you tomorrow.
Agostino, my coffee, quickly!
Agostino!
Pilar! My coffee!
You are serving?
It is the girl's communion.
You gave her a day off?
Just a week.
Portugal is far away.
I will not pay
for you to do their job.
I will not die this once.
And I like
being alone in my kitchen.
You're Mrs. Pujol
do not forget it.
Every morning I wake and say:
I am Mrs. Pujol ... "
Your meeting with the German
buyer went well?
For a success they must be
entertained
I took him to dinner in Lille
then to Badaboum.
Will you take me there?
In Badaboum?
-Yes.
You're crazy!
It is not your place.
It's not my place in the kitchen
it's not my place to Badaboum ...
Where's my place?
Stop with your stupid questions.
You have not drunk too much?
Leave me be.
You know what the doctor said.
I know!
You're apprehensive.
It is not easy to run an
umbrella factory with 300 workers
Every day I fight the unions.
Not to mention taxes!
Daddy said the same thing.
In his time, it was easy.
And for what he did ...
Fortunately I recovered
the situation.
That's true.
You brought your dynamism.
I brought my factory from
my dowry
I must listen to the news.
* In the provinces with orders to strike
were initiated by unions.
We'll ask our guest
Communist MP Maurice ...
Oh! Why him.
*- While employers will not want
not include measures
needed for
workers, we will fight ...
Damn, workers!
So when he goes
mangling my plant?
Scavenger!
Michèle Torr *:
"Take me dancing tonight."
Oh, his drops!
Office of Mr. Pujol,
I listen.
* Miss Nadège,
Ms. Pujol here.
Oh, hello, Ms. Pujol.
My husband came home late last
night from Badaboum
and this morning
he forgot to take his drops.
So if you can tell
to iron as it arrives.
Is that I can not ...
You know the state he gets
in when he doesn't take them
I count on you?
I will tell him
Thank you. Goodbye.
A good thing done.
Hello, sir.
What else?
I would like to talk
with you.
You already on a
cigarette break?
Excuse us, Mr. Pujol.
Hello, Nadège.
Your wife called.
What does she want?
"Your drops."
What did she piss me off!
No key.
What?
What's the story
of A. llemand?
I'll explain.
Unnecessary.
You're not gonna make me a scene.
Tomorrow night, belt.
You will return
at Badaboum.
It is closed on Thursdays.
- Mom, are you there?
- Joel! Hello, my darling.
I just bought it.
Oh, thank you.
How thoughtful.
You're morning.
How are the children.
They are agitated.
Their father is away.
Help me.
You contacted him?
Jean-Charles finally phoned me
Toronto.
Business is good?
Surely.
I think we will separate.
What?
He travels all the time,
we never see him.
I feel he is not
interested in me more.
You should accompany him.
And the kids, who would keep them?
Me.
No way.
You pass them all.
The education of my children,
it's me who will take charge.
How sad.
Separate yourself
Jean-Charles anytime soon.
Yes, I know.
The idea that
wrong is unbearable.
You talked to the children?
No, just myself.
Even among the most united couples,
there is idle time.
And then it goes away.
Or it will not restart.
What do you know something.
How long have you been
sleeping alone?
I do not
talk about that.
When did he behave as husband
with you for the last time?
You think
I would like these accounts there!
There is no
than sex in life.
At your age, perhaps.
Your father works so much!
In the evening he is tired.
Not deceive you.
I forbid you
to criticize your father.
It's not he I criticize,
it is you.
You have accepted everything.
You pretend not to see,
But he is not shy.
I have always been impervious
to gossip.
And then I have my grandchildren,
my garden, my poems ...
But are you happy, Mom?
Of course I'm happy.
I decided
once and for all.
Me, I do not want
this pathetic life.
I prefer to divorce.
You do not work.
I'll ask dad for
a position at the factory.
It's not a bad idea.
You need to know its what you want.
Me at least, I know.
The worst thing for me would be
to become like you: a trophy wife.
- Joel?
You do it on purpose, eh?
Do not park outside the entrance!
I stopped by for
Mom's birthday.
The anniversary of ...
Forgot?
The bitch Nadège forgot.
She has something else to think.
Buy what you want
I'll pay you back.
Dad, you never change.
Tonight try to
be in a better mood.
I talk to you.
You know what she wants?
Divorce.
I refourguer her Jean Charles?
No!
Working with her beloved father.
No way.
And her kids?
Good. Get, my drops.
Lawrence is not here?
He arrives tonight.
He has good news for us.
I am wary of good news.
I think he wants to marry.
It's wonderful, yes?
Maintaining a new household ...
But it does ask you anything.
But it will come.
The girl who has got hold
above knows where it falls.
I reassure you,
her family is respectable.
She is the daughter of the baker,
Cathedral Square,
Floriane Marquiset.
Robert!
My God! But ...
Name of God, dammit!
It seems she is nice.
She studied piano.
"She studied the piano?
You would have preferred the clarinet?
It is beyond belief for him
to marry Floriane Marquiset.
A Pujol with Marquiset,
it would catastrophe.
You're way too snobby.
Wait to meet her.
I will never meet her.
And Lawrence will not marry
Marquiset daughter!
You understand?
If you want my opinion ...
Your "opinion"?
You have an opinion?
All I ask of you
is to share mine.
Be nice,
Just keep your little poems.
Joel is right.
I am a figurehead.
I'm lying there in a corner ...
I am part of the decor.
You challenge me also?
Name one woman as spoiled as you.
With regard to appliances,
I am a queen.
You are fulfilled,
you are obliged to admit it.
The phone also.
What a life!
Hello?
Oh, that's not true!
Dammit!
Oh, damn!
I'm coming.
What is there still?
It continues.
They striked at the workshop 4.
A strike?
It will cost me millions.
What will you do?
Fight!
The ... But Robert ...
Be careful though.
A strike!
A strike ...
"The rose in the morning
"Is hatched at noon
"Ephemeral destiny
"She died at midnight."
How's Dad?
Always a bad mood
with these strikes.
You think it'll get better tonight?
Hopefully.
I am sure he will be charming,
for my birthday.
Your studies, are you satisfied?
I'm tired.
Science, it's not my thing.
What is your thing?
I dunno, Mom.
You always take
During your drawing?
I have no time.
Then what good is.
Shame, you were gifted.
I wish I had
an artist in the family.
You know what would make me happy?
What?
Come to work at the plant.
I do not care for the plant.
I do not want
to work with Dad.
Finally the boss reaction
hated by everyone ...
Your grandfather
was adored by everyone.
Mom, paternalism,
It's over, old-fashioned.
Today must be a bastard,
orders, unbridled capitalism.
Tell me, Floriane, when did
you meet her?
It's been six months.
We met
the train.
It's romantic.
You're sure to fall in love?
Yes, Mom.
It is crazy to me.
So much the better.
It is happiness.
On Sunday, after Mass
we stopped at her mother.
We took the ice bomb.
I revisit the beautiful Ms. Marquiset
behind his car,
always so well dressed.
She died
electrocuted by a hairdryer.
You think about getting married?
Floriane, yes.
When will we meet her?
Once she has finished
his examinations in Paris.
That happiness.
Look what I made you
for your birthday.
You had to wait for dessert.
- Let him.
It's so nice.
Thank you, Flavia.
Dad came when?
I dunno.
His schedule
is very mysterious.
It represents what, exactly?
Terrorists
with machine guns.
It's fun.
What imagination!
Grandma, I have prepared
an imitation of Coluche.
No, Stanislaus,
Coluche not that horrible.
Yet it is funny.
In Paris, it has to please.
It would do you good to travel.
Your Jean-Charles never do you spell?
Lawrence is not the time.
Papa. I'll open it.
He has his key.
I'm coming, Dad. I'm coming.
Nadège? What are you doing?
I must track Ms. Pujol.
It is in the lounge.
Nadège miss?
Madam, it's horrible.
It's horrible.
Papa?
Yes. Pujol ...
It was an attack?
No. It is sequestered.
ESCROW?
Yes.
He fought
with the foreman.
The workers were trapped
in his office.
I was sure.
There was a nervousness this morning!
They have
machine guns?
Stanislaus, Flavian
go upstairs.
You must call the warden,
to send a mediator.
We must send the CRS.
It is not with batons
we rule anything.
These workers are outlawed.
We must act with diplomacy.
Obviously.
You side with the left.
Beside you,
everyone is left.
That's enough, calm down.
Miss,
what do they want
exactly?
They require new
health care.
This is not abusive.
The toilets are long-standing.
They are Turkish!
It is a political pretext.
They demand everything now:
Increase in staff
13th month ...
Remove surveillance.
Obviously, that's a lot.
That this foul Babin
who takes them.
It foments revolt.
You heard
on the radio?
It gives me goosebumps
that man.
Provided he takes his drops.
He always forgets.
If I was not there ...
Finally, if you were not there ...
If we were not there.
Do not apologize.
You are broke ...
But where?
They take me hostage
in his place.
Anyway.
I recognize you there.
I go there.
Come see.
- They let him go?
They talked with him.
It Hubert
One of the worst.
I hope they will
understanding.
They are increasingly numerous.
They brandished banners.
They wrote
on the wall:
"Pujol = Hitler."
They exaggerate.
Besides the little bit
on the front ...
The fever rises.
I'm afraid.
Me too.
Nadège, lock the door.
Madam! Madam!
They approach the house.
Calm down.
Marie Antoinette found herself
in the same situation.
She still finished
under the guillotine.
What do they cry?
Pujol ... Fed up ...
Pujol, fed ...
PUJOL, fed up!
PUJOL, fed up!
PUJOL, fed up!
PUJOL, fed up!
What are you doing here?
A moment of relaxation.
Some claims
are not unjustified.
Secretary model
turns into rabid unionist.
It will not last long.
You have to put in place
Employees, too.
You do not know what it is,
you are the boss's daughter.
It's better than the hen.
I forbid you ...
We rang the doorbell.
Who is it?
I go there.
If it's the workers, do not open.
Trust me.
Who's there?
Lawrence? Already?
- You're not hurt, at least.
Addressing my brother!
They are madmen.
You're not there.
It's not them. Papa.
"Dad"?
- Robert?
The workers helped me
to see dad.
I tried to reason with
him to make concessions.
He jumped on me screaming:
"Casse-toi, pauvre con!"
Fortunately, the picket line
the belt.
In this case,
it is better that I go.
Mom,
they will laugh at you.
I do not want to be sick
your father on his conscience.
You want me with you?
No, darling.
It is better
I have to go alone.
- It's the boss's wife!
Yes?
M. The deputy mayor, good evening.
Ms. Pujol?
Can I come in?
Yes, of course.
Yes ...
I'm sorry
introduce myself like that.
I'm not here
to the mundane.
Then sit down.
To my left or my right.
Wherever you want.
What is your presence,
Ms. Pujol?
M. The deputy mayor,
I came to ask you
to use your influence
to release my husband.
It is with the stewards
need for dialogue.
My husband refuses.
I think it would be better
negotiate amicably.
"Friendly"?
One worker was attacked!
My husband is impulsive.
His left fist
alone?
Why are you aggressive?
I do not see why
I'll help you.
You do not always say that,
if you see what I mean.
Don't bring up the past.
Our moment of madness would it
incompatible with your image?
At least not with the image
a perfect wife.
Perhaps I'd
without you.
Do not blame me.
After all,
a youthful,
it happens.
Quiet!
I say the same for you
as for me.
You were a girl, a woman boss
and I proletarian.
I betrayed my class.
Which is worse?
I remember
I was returning from a wedding.
Sir! Sir!
I punctured a tire on the road.
By chance we crossed.
- It was my usual route.
I attend my next
even if I disagree
political opinion.
Hello.
You should have seen
the state of your dress.
Hello.
All stained with grease,
the jack in hand.
- I wore a dress in organza
with a pink cape.
- I changed your wheel
and you made me smile,
abandoning for a moment
the arrogance of your caste.
- Grandpa was a boilermaker.
You refused the tip I offered.
- But I accepted a cigarette.
We went to the smoking set,
in the shade of a walnut.
- Before we went
in the undergrowth.
You must have thought
me an easy woman.
- No, Suzanne.
The very next day
you resume your distance
and you close firmly
the curtain on our adventure.
I was married, a mother.
I had a home to support.
How many times have I feared
you brag about it.
I know my tongue when honor
of a woman is at stake
Thank you.
Good.
Want
that you make your husband?
Yes.
But if I get his release
I will need consideration.
"A return?
Sir, I dare not understand.
At our age?
No, you misunderstand.
It is no longer burning truck
that is facing you.
I'm confused. Forgiveness.
No, it should not.
In other circumstances ...
Oh yeah?
We leave the subject.
I think the role you might
play within the plant.
That is to say?
If reforms are not
applied in the immediate future,
it will closed
the company
and 300 workers unemployed.
That's a lot.
Yes, Suzanne.
So? What did the doctor say?
I do not know.
He is always with Dad.
He knows how
he was released?
He better not tell him.
How humiliating!
Liberated by his worst enemy.
If the CRS had occurred,
we have not needed it.
Do not be primary.
Even the communists have a heart.
There was enough to break a man.
His gaze was not the same.
He will recover very well.
And if I did
my little broth?
Why not.
- You need some rest, darling.
You are not
safe from another attack,
and you may have
a pulmonary edema.
You must spend one week
in hospital for tests.
But the factory?
The plant will fold without you.
I'll leave you.
Here the order.
Mr. Pujol, I count on you
this week in the hospital.
There.
Thank you, doctor.
See you soon.
You have talked to Lawrence
about Marquiset?
You told him to forget it?
You must understand
he is in love.
You force me to reveal
something unpleasant
You give me no choice.
I have reason to believe
Floriane is a part daughter.
What do you mean
"a part daughter"?
Her mother told me.
She is no longer of this world ...
So Ms. Marquiset
was your mistress?
Immediately the big words.
What a fine husband!
Your reaction is a little late.
You're quite certain worry.
It is true that we were
Discrete.
She was married.
It was not arousing
suspicions of the husband.
It is the fault of your son.
This remained a much-needed
to get
Early Marquiset of all.
That replaces the gift
birthday that you forgot!
You want me to beg your pardon?
No. You disgust me.
Under these conditions, you will agree
that marriage is unthinkable.
They are already sleeping together.
Oh my!
The scope of the Marquiset,
You will not prevail in paradise.
Why, God?
It is so long ago.
But because ...
it is the drop
that broke the vase!
It's alright, ma'am?
Yes, that's fine.
I made my little broth.
That's nice.
It will do him good.
Cuckoo!
What are you doing here?
I'm here
I'm here
for my little specialty.
Yes.
It can not hurt.
I want you to take
my little broth.
Nadège Miss is really
a secretary model.
She prepared a broth
for your father.
She will receive in the figure.
It happened.
Let him come.
Who?
The one who freed your father.
This man here?
It is you who ...
- That's me.
- But it's the devil!
- Hello.
Welcome, Mr. MP.
And thank you again.
Stewards
feel they have
1, no.
They require
an immediate response.
Is that my husband
is not in form this morning.
Tomorrow
he may receive visits.
You do not care about me?
It's the truth.
True, he is very weak.
You want a certificate?
I hired my responsibility.
If I pleaded his case,
This is for the workers.
So in the absence of negotiations,
there will be a restoration
of the strike.
- Me, I will predict
my foot in the ass!
Mr. Pujol!
He does not look sick.
What are you doing to me?
It is not enough
for having humiliated?
Come on, Dad ...
Shut up, asshole!
Dad, be reasonable.
You will strain your heart.
What have you done to me?
I only promised
M. The deputy mayor
in exchange for your release
you would consider requests
staff.
I am for.
Me too.
For the brainwashing ...
Robert, you constantly fight.
We must negotiate.
Tell the delegates
that if they want
paid holidays,
they must
return to work.
If they want to earn more,
will require more work.
They thought I was finished, washed.
My family was ready
to sell off the plant.
Once
picket lines removed,
I'll show you what it is
a boss who has two.
- Let me tell you
the Works
has decided to review your accounts.
How?
That your Mercedes is considered
as a company car.
Your apartment
your home, your boat
passed
under the expense
the company.
Dad!
Heart attack, as I predicted.
Raise his head.
Press firmly.
My father heart-attack.
Send an ambulance.
This is where is anger leads.
He will go to hospital now.
what about the plant?
Your father should
be replaced
by his attorney.
In this case ...
No. Sorry.
The management of a factory,
Not for me.
Me?
She is worse than dad.
But then who?
Jean-Charles.
OH NO, NOT HIM.
Why not you, Ms. Pujol?
It's a joke?
It would be justified.
The founder's daughter,
the boss's wife.
But I know nothing.
You will not really
Plant Manager.
Just sit
Dad in the chair.
They will not give you
responsibilities.
Still, I do not know if I ...
Suzanne, do what you're told.
Do what you're told.
Better you than someone else.
We have no choice.
If it's you who ask me ...
I will do nothing to cause you concern.
Still happy.
So you agree?
In the interest of the factory, yes.
It's okay, I'll be fine.
I count on you
to keep me informed.
Count me in, boss.
I take your place?
Yes. You do that
very well.
No, Nadège.
It is I who am going with Dad.
It would have been easier
if you had
successor to your father.
You're going in the direction
history.
Women everywhere
take power.
Go, go home.
Must
Do you speak to Mr. Babin.
In what state of mind
will you meet the committee?
Conciliation. Provided
they do not ask too much.
When the worker
demand too much,
is that the boss
do not give enough.
Good. We must prepare
a little history,
so what you
'll say, do not stutter.
It's a good idea.
Me, I would start by:
"Gentlemen, I come to you
in a spirit of understanding ... "
"Gentlemen"?
It's cold, it's a snob.
I will tell them "my friends".
I would not recommend.
These are not your friends.
They will become.
It would take action,
not empty words.
Good. Resume.
"In a spirit
understanding.
"I am a woman,
but ... "
I can not say that.
It shows, right?
I do not apologize
being a woman.
It's not that ...
You are a misogynist.
We support
women's demands.
I can not say
"I am a woman."
I will say:
"Yes, I am a woman."
Because whether you like it or not,
I am a woman.
But I like it.
I like it very much, Suzanne.
They wait for you.
Already?
If we want
that work resumes,
let's go.
They are how?
Not very endorsements.
The less you will hanging around,
better.
I would suit me.
You're fine.
I know what I do.
They can wait.
No, really.
It tells you nothing,
you, the factory?
It should?
When the vein was
being a dad to son
and that fact Science Po ..
I am "a son to dad?
You are the son Pujol.
It does not interest me, all that.
The money, possession,
benefits.
I am against exploitation
rights.
You said to your father?
He says what?
I'd
eaten by the others.
Politically, you're engaged?
Politics, protests,
very little for me.
Everything is political commitment.
What interests you?
Yes.
Painting, art history,
Kandinsky ...
Ah yes!
Kandinsky, yes.
He was a true revolutionary.
You see that you care
politics.
Che Guevara, Georges Marchais,
Kandinsky ...
The politics of art.
I enjoy interacting
ideas with youth.
We should have a drink,
one day, together.
Yes.
What's that?
It's not like you?
It's not too much, Mom?
But why?
You will not submit
factory in this outfit?
It's provocation.
I wish to honor the workers.
And I put all my jewelry.
Without them I would not.
They earn.
Wish
they enjoy.
Let's go.
It's the dress you ...
You recognized?
It is not forgotten.
The committee is
in the boardroom steward.
I have one of these traces.
I'll leave you.
Miss Nadège will accompany you.
You abandon me?
The committee would take a dim view
I attend the meeting.
Are you sure?
Yes. Go ahead.
Call me when you're done.
It's gonna be alright.
You do not leave me, do you?
No, ma'am.
My dress is too much?
No, no.
That's fine.
Men, they must
in an eyeful.
They are how many?
Ten, I think.
Provided they are nice.
Gentlemen.
Good morning, gentlemen.
HELLO, MRS PUJOL.
Sit down, guys.
My dear friends,
as you know,
my husband was hospitalized.
I will replace
until the end of his convalescence.
I am delighted to meet you
to get acquainted,
so we can chat ...
As you are aware,
your husband rushes plant
in a catastrophic situation.
If we are on strike today
It is no fun.
We love our work.
We are fed up
undergo ...
No need
to the wicked.
Moreover,
I am pleased to see
your evolution.
My father took you
as an apprentice
would be proud to know you
still here.
So what are
your concerns, my friend?
Ms. Pujol
I'll be very clear.
We will not resume work
that will be adopted when
the following claims.
1. Award of 13th month
to all employees
effective retroactively
January 1.
2. The fifth week
paid leave.
3. Reorganization
working time
and generalization of 40 hours
with extra hours
additional 25%
pursuant to Article 1 ...
As Dad said:
"There is no need
"To load the mule
for it to happen. "
In any case,
I agree with you.
No more.
It is time we resume
the desire to work together.
Concretely, what does that mean?
I swear on the head
my children
to examine your queries
with the most sincere attention
to improve
the situation in our factory.
As you know,
I am a woman
Mr. Pujol.
So it is also my boss.
I can understand.
Except that for me
not about to strike.
Congratulations, boss.
- Mom? Mom?
So?
How did it go?
They go back to work tomorrow.
It's great.
I knew you could do it.
You have given in on everything?
No. We negotiated.
You know, I really thought
the situation.
I would ask you
a sacrifice.
I want you to be
beside me.
We
beside you, Mama.
Whether you work with me.
Joel, I wanted to propose
help me to management.
At the factory, with you?
I know you want to
work with your father.
Thank you, Mom!
You gonna décoiffer.
I go out tonight.
Like that, it gets better
Jean-Charles.
And I'll do what?
I have my classes at Sciences Po
It would do you good
have experience.
It does not interest me.
We will find you
artistic positions.
And Floriane in Paris?
I had forgotten that.
On weekends, we will
have concerts at the plant.
Music, it does not hurt,
especially not the workers.
Come to us.
A factory-Pujol Michonneau.
A FACTORY-PUJOL Michonneau.
* Baccara: "Do you speak French?"
* Baccara: "Do you speak French?"
Who's the bourgeois
with the yokel?
Hey! It is not
Women at Pujol, right?
Pujol? Our Pujol?
Why are you smiling?
Imagine Robert's face
if he saw me here, and with you.
The poor man.
Thank you for your action
at the plant.
I could not have done alone.
It's nothing.
You know what surprises me the most?
No.
Is to celebrate the end of the strike,
here with you, bang.
I know this is not
a place for me,
but I dreamed
to come.
It's here
he brings his clients.
Tonight, Suzanne
I am your customer.
* Once Upon a Time:
"Come take a walk in the rain."
Thank you.
Forgiveness.
Can we start over again?
Alas ...
You are the woman of my life
Suzanne.
And if we did
our life together?
It is impossible.
You forget
your mistress.
Who told you that?
It is a disgrace.
It is called politics.
It is a challenging rival.
You know, Suzanne,
old activist that I am
begins to falter.
This revolution
for which I fought,
I sometimes wonder
if I see her.
I fight again
for generations to come
know a better world.
But
I have a right to happiness.
I would bring you?
I have a name much to bear:
Michonneau-Pujol.
But you will change.
How will you introduce me?
Suzanne comrade?
I can already hear the jeers.
I explain them.
You too are
loving justice.
You will share our beliefs.
We will see together
brighter future.
You will lose your scarf
and your seat in Parliament.
And I am a married woman.
But you do not like this man.
After so much time together,
links have been forged,
invisible but solid.
Of you, Robert
who most need me.
Oh, Susanna!
I lose you again.
But no, no.
We continue to see us.
We go out together,
dine face to face,
remain good friends.
As is reasonable.
It is our age.
Oh, Susanna!
Maurice ...
Suzanne!
- The demand for umbrellas in India
is 14% per year.
By increasing our sales by 25%
we would get ...
43.70% of the market.
Exactly.
Not to mention the forecast
Climate
which predict an increase
rains.
What he falls,
there!
So if I count
an umbrella for two households,
knowing that they are 110 million
this is ...
22 million seeds.
Yes, 22 million.
It would be a big market.
The Japanese are already established.
You put me all in the clear
and you make me a summary
for the sales manager.
And for my daughter too.
Ah? Okay.
At what time my husband arrives?
11 h 10.
Make sure I do not
appointment.
What Lawrence
will show us?
Hello, ma'am.
Hello, darling.
Hello, my friends.
HELLO, MRS PUJOL.
How are you?
VERY WELL.
Call me Suzanne.
So?
We finished the sketches
the new collection
which could be called
Collection Arc-en-ciel.
What a lovely idea!
One, two, three.
Oh! This one is very pretty.
I love these colors.
What do you think, Nadège?
A bit garish.
But it is the fashion.
It's so original.
Look, Mom. A surprise.
Kandinsky line.
Oh! It's daring.
That's the high end.
That same
revolutionary.
At a Glance
Mr. Babin.
Otherwise, we began sketching
for the line waxed
But we are not developed.
Like your father will be proud
and happy with your efforts.
Hopefully.
They are amazing.
It surprised me, anyway.
Mom, can I talk to you?
Can it wait till this afternoon?
I want to see you
before Dad arrives.
Ms. Pujol office.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
You are not expected until tomorrow.
Yes, yes. Okay, I'm coming.
I have a report that made me
Jean-Charles absolutely wonderful.
Feeling better with him!
I told you so.
This report gives us ideas
on the future of the plant.
Among other things,
relocation plan
Tunisia
to increase
our figures of 35%.
Can you imagine?
I will read it tonight.
You delivered it?
Yes. I hope I am not
pregnant again.
You told me ...
Are you sure it's his?
What do you take me for?
Excuse me.
You should thank Jean-Charles.
But the priority,
is to restore a social climate
harmonious within the plant.
But we must also
look ahead and modernize.
But modernity, without layoffs.
When will you stop
listen to your communist?
The deputy mayor has nothing to do
with my management of the plant.
I happened to see,
and opposed
to my initiatives.
Then read this report.
I promise.
I remember how Daddy
was loved by his workers.
He led the plant
for over 40 years
and never a single day
stop working, even in 1936.
Workers
retiring,
he offered slippers,
an umbrella numbered
and his autographed photo.
Alas, we are in 1977.
I have not forgotten.
Hello, Mr. Pujol.
Hello, Nadège.
How are you?
Very good.
You've really missed.
I, too, Robert.
One second, please.
I have something to ask you.
The problem of structure
the first pit ...
Ah, you excite me.
- Stop.
It might surprise us.
They are being eaten.
No. There was a meeting
in the boardroom
on new strategies
development.
"Development"?
My ass, yes.
Why you have not
provided further?
And my mail?
A postcard!
I did not have my little secretary
favorite in my luggage.
Enough now!
You're not happy to see me?
Not like this.
I am no longer the same.
What are you doing, Nadège?
I changed.
I am a new woman
thanks to the patron.
You make the boss too?
She, she respects me.
Come finish
what we started.
I'm excited.
I made my decision.
You must leave
your wife for me.
Leave Suzanne?
You're mad?
I have always cheated.
It suits him.
I do not want to live
in the shade.
I'm not the vase # 2.
Nadege!
Nadege!
Suzanne!
You're back?
I landed at the minute.
I wanted to celebrate your return.
I wanted to do
a surprise.
And I brought a gift
Greece to the queen of the umbrella.
You thought of me?
You've changed the decor?
I added
a little color.
It's beautiful!
I knew it would please you.
You're spoiled, Ms. Pujol.
He has not done for me.
It
real diamonds?
Here, I thought of you too.
Really?
Turkish delight?
Turkish delight? I love it.
Thank you for my diet.
Let us, Nadège.
Very good.
If you can assist
man in trouble
without becoming skeptical
as to its quality,
if you know to be beautiful
without being boring,
if you can be strong
without being impatient
experienced
without taking age,
friendly and smiling
even with a wild
if you know how to type,
note, phone,
if you can give birth
at lunchtime
then better architect,
engineer or minister,
forever protected from the peaks
where it shines,
thou shalt secretary
my daughter.
It is completely crazy.
But no.
Me, I like it.
You saw her new hairstyle?
No.
Give him a compliment.
Me, you know ...
You could force you,
anyway.
Without force me,
you, I do not know
what you did,
but I think you're better than before.
You kiss me?
I'm your husband.
You'll have spent 30 years
to keep that in mind.
What I'm pissed
during this cruise.
But it has been good.
You're fit,
tan ...
I have energy to spare.
Holidays over
for guys too.
What vacation?
Last 3 months at the plant.
It was not a vacation.
We even caught
strike days.
You received the reports?
Absolutely.
You've done everything
for that I am concerned.
No, Robert, I assure you.
After a rainy day
we had,
it runs well,
and even very good.
Still, after a strike.
You sat in my chair,
you took your air bland,
you have generously
all inc.
You have been remarkable.
It presents its range
Ms. CEO at the door
and we will return
its domestic activities.
I'm afraid not, Robert.
Who's the boss here?
Me.
Analysis a bit.
I represent employers a smile
fair, warm.
I even managed to impose
your children in the factory.
Why I should leave?
I have control of the majority
actions, poor turkey.
Do you?
I looked things
during your cruise.
Dad left me 15%
actions.
My sister has inherited much.
Add to that the 20%
Lawrence and Joel,
more small shareholders.
In total,
I am 55% under my belt.
You do not have that 45.
Suzanne!
But I will defend
your interests as a lioness.
You'll be able to live
for yourself!
Golf, fishing,
hunting, bridge ...
You will not miss.
It's me, the trophy wife?
Somehow.
But you get used very much.
Enter.
Dad? You're back?
Hello.
It sounds to go.
Your tricks,
it will not happen like that.
I have not said the last word.
Lawrence has nothing to do
in all this.
He runs the design of
Pujol umbrellas ...
I do not give a fuck!
I want my place!
He did a great job
remarkable.
Forget it, Mom.
Dad will not change.
I'll miss my train.
Do not put yourself behind.
Floriane and kisses for me.
Courage.
"Floriane"?
Early Marquiset.
He'll see in Paris.
They look
to get along wonderfully.
You're crazy.
You forgot what I said.
I still have it on the stomach.
They no longer have to see.
They are brother and sister.
Thee higher among sisters?
You are so respectable?
It bores me
to tell it like that ...
Do not get angry.
Go ahead, speak.
Lawrence and Floriane can marry
with impunity.
But I'm telling you ...
They are not brother and sister.
Huh?
Think!
No! Lawrence ...
Yes.
You lie.
You make me walk.
Put yourself in my shoes.
I was young, quite cute
completely neglected
by an unfaithful husband.
I am avenged.
I regret nothing.
And I fixed your mistake.
With whom have you deceived me?
There are limits.
And calm down.
My factory, my wife, my son ...
It's the end of the lunch break.
It was good to see you again.
We still have things
things to discuss.
I must get back to work.
There is a quiche
awaits you in the fridge.
I'm not hungry.
You will not sulk anyway.
I installed the TV
in your room.
The afternoon?
There was "Madame Today."
* Women's work,
you are for?
* It gives an impression
equality with men.
* The husband should win
enough money
* To his wife
could stay at home.
* It is our job.
* This is not a bad idea.
It brings money.
* It may not have
a salary like yours?
* It should fill them.
If they stay at home
* After this short.
Oh, Joel!
My darling!
I'm glad to see you.
But you're beautiful.
It seems
Do you work at the plant.
Mom, she trusts me.
Blame!
You're all against me?
But no.
We missed you.
I'm rolling, Joel.
Your mother got completed.
I know
It's another woman.
With it means more than
"Participation" means "self."
Jean-Charles is very concerned
for the future of the plant.
But it shifted things
that denied thee Babin.
Yes, that's Babin.
It is his toy.
He manipulates.
He jumps?
Oh, Daddy!
I'd rather not know.
In my opinion, it does not date
today.
I found this.
The bitch!
So that was it.
"Him" What?
She will pay for this.
Hello. I want to talk
Mr. Babin.
You have an appointment?
I am Mr. Pujol.
Robert Pujol.
Mr. Babin, hello.
In return, yes.
And I need your help.
I have a report on measures
intended by my wife.
To undo any
what you did.
What have I done?
The wildcat strike
my confinement,
all that has been conducted
masterfully.
Then you arrange
to make the report public
who wants to reduce
staff and relocate.
I will not tell you
your job, Babin.
And I want my job.
Convince rather
Your Board
especially your workers.
You are a manipulator
mass Babin.
And with
money to set ...
You take me for a clown
which encourages employers?
For a man
double face, my dear.
What do you imply?
What were you doing with my wife
at Badaboum?
How?
Do not make the innocent.
And expect more.
You will be surprised with Ms. Pujol
in the cafeteria of the Sofitel.
We met to talk
working conditions of the plant.
With all these precautions
not to be recognized?
We wanted to avoid
to talk.
What would
your constituents
and the Central Committee
if they found
in the local rag
Photo of
incorruptible member
trying to break out the champagne
with Ms. Pujol.
Why do
Explode a scandal
that we may
splashing all?
Why?
Because I am a man betrayed
and I do not care about the scandal.
Listen,
Nothing has happened
between your wife and me.
And there 25 years?
- My God!
That's me.
Suzanne loves me, then.
It may cost you
I found that if your adventure
gave birth to a brat,
my son Lawrence.
Lawrence?
Your son?
My son?
Alas, yes.
Are you sure?
Oh, I was not there!
That life is singular.
We believe
an old fighter hardened
and we found a young dad.
Your blackmailing me has made
me the happiest of men
Anyway, if you
do not cause this strike,
Your career is shattered.
Yes. Yes, Pujol.
These are our first
competitors, the Chinese.
They are very interested ...
Ms. Pujol?
My mother did an interview.
It makes me happy to see you.
Me too.
What youth, what enthusiasm!
Are you alright, Mr. Babin?
That hair, that smile,
the look ...
Mr MP?
Would you tell them
how the region is proud
to have a woman like me ...
I will not attend
your worship
personality.
Excuse him, he is a communist.
It makes me happy
see you, you.
Me too ...
I'm all yours.
Could we see
her alone?
Will
in my office.
I prefer in my car.
In your car?
It's uncomfortable.
Follow me.
You accompany these gentlemen?
Yes.
Be careful.
Babin is a bit weird.
- Yes, I come, I come.
Your husband came to see me.
Is it true, Suzanne
that your son is mine?
Finally, my son
is not his.
You have cancan
behind my back.
What is this nonsense?
The truth.
Say the truth.
One word can make me
the happiest of men.
Is Lawrence my son?
I wish you
that pleasure, Mr. The deputy mayor ...
If we look
on dates ...
Just my photo
in your locket.
You have my medallion?
I have been looking for months.
Your husband you will dive.
Tell me, Lawrence.
No, Maurice,
It is not you.
Really?
Finally, it is of Pujol.
No. It is neither of you
or him.
Who is it then?
I have every reason to believe
that is the son of Mr. Balestra.
The notary?
- He was a clerk at the time.
This is surprising
when seen today.
I often spent in the study
for dad's estate.
He was young, charming.
There was in his office
this big leather sofa.
Everything suggests that Lawrence
is the son of Mr. Balestra.
Although, if I rely only
appearances,
it is the portrait of Gunnar.
This cheerful Swede who gave
tennis courts
club for children,
a tall blond pretty hefty.
There have been many?
No. No other in May 1952.
Poor Pujol married
a bourgeois nymphomaniac.
You do not judge
my youth differentials.
You have benefited.
I had placed
on a pedestal.
I happened to come down.
I've only had brief adventures.
That's ancient history.
I have other concerns.
Exactly.
What's that?
This is the report by Jean-Charles.
I must read.
She'll be angry.
I am a double murder,
Suzanne.
After the revelations of your husband
I thought, as in a dream
become a father
and your companion. How
I've been blind me as much?
You never ceased
to be the same:
Wifey confined
in his world of lies.
And I thought to myself
a tryst,
in memory of our meeting!
I am served.
I beg you kindly
get out of my car.
The plant is over 5 km.
And I have heels.
This is where our journey ends.
Farewell, Suzanne. Goodbye.
Hey!
Thank you, sir.
You have saved my life.
How am I going to go?
Oops, my skirt!
You travel this way often?
It happens. Why?
It's pretty, is not it?
Very pretty.
NO TO OUTSOURCING!
NO TO OUTSOURCING!
* Ms. Pujol promised
constant dialogue.
* It's always the same.
We trust the bosses,
and later, Tintin!
* I condemn the use
unhealthy
this report
I strongly condemn
and do not want to use.
She is beautiful, Grandma.
* Many believed in her.
She continues the politics
of her husband.
*- We must return to a report
healthy with the unions.
* I met
the Board of Directors
to find a solution.
Hah!
Do not worry, Mom.
Everyone supports you.
So why strike?
Principle.
Your father has mounted
shareholders against me.
I reassure you,
they will be on our side.
Fortunately you're there.
What I would have become
without my son?
Thank you, Lawrence.
This is normal.
Poor Floriane,
I have kept you from her.
With you, I learned a lot.
How do I look?
You're perfect.
So let's go.
Hello, my friends.
Following the incidents
following the publication
of this report to be accused
have commanded
a meeting of our Board
Administration has been claimed.
I wish, in a fraternal spirit,
we can debate.
Mr. Pujol, you mean?
Yes, Madam Chair.
I would like
in these circumstances of crisis
propose a vote
at the meeting:
For or against the continuation
your plant management,
madam.
Knowing that I am prepared
to take over the reins
as soon as possible.
Things are clear.
The situation calls
for some urgency.
Good. To a vote.
Miss Nadège,
do you want to record the votes?
Naturally.
- Starting on my left.
Do you think I care
the factory management?
Yes, Mom. I give my 10%.
- Over my 15%
it's been 25%.
Ms. Genevieve?
I'll keep my confidence, Suzanne
and I give you my 15%.
Thank you, my dear sister.
Mr. Pujol?
I vote against your direction.
It is 45%.
- Okay.
Gentlemen?
Despite the destabilization
you have suffered,
we recognize the value
your work in recent months.
And then,
we report our 5%.
Ms. Pujol, 45 points.
Pujol 45 points.
Leaving only my daughter, Joelle,
whom I have wisely
advised and assisted
during these few months.
I give my 10% ...
To Robert Pujol, my father.
Thank you, my daughter.
The bitch!
- What a bitch!
- Lawrence, you have a moment?
I have things to say.
We have nothing to say.
I'm going.
Listen, Lawrence
I'm getting older and tireder
and I'm not in great shape.
I put my energy and passion
in developing this plant.
I know that during my absence
You have been remarkable.
I want you to work here,
to one day take my estate.
You try to relent.
It's too late.
It is never too late.
Especially after
what you just did.
I took my place
better than you make.
Your methods disgust me.
You will do anything,
even crush your own wife.
He has warped you!
Babin.
Mr. Babin has nothing
to do with this.
Much
than you think.
So you agree
to remain at the plant
to work with your father?
My father?
When you have been
a father for me?
Say it with me
you are here.
I've allowed to have
a strategic position.
That is how you thank me.
What ingratitude!
Dad would have offered
the same position.
You are very naive
my daughter.
If you knew what he said when
I asked him to involve you.
Do not be cruel.
But allow me to regret
your lack of female solidarity.
There is no solidarity,
but of competence.
You are your father's daughter.
He is happy to use
Jean-Charles' report.
I beg you, mom
do not get angry.
You blamed me
Meals to be!
But you were happy.
That's what I thought.
What you do not dare to do:
Divorce.
You can not do that.
What is your mother
the vase of service?
I am entitled to my freedom.
But why ...
Why should I fight you
when I'm your mother?
You want the truth, Mom?
Sure.
I voted against you
because of Jean-Charles.
How?
Papa promised to give him
my 10% post cons.
You give your position?
Yes.
That way, Jean-Charles
will stay here with me.
I am no longer able
to live alone.
I'm pregnant, Mama.
I'm going on maternity leave
and I leave my place.
It is monstrous.
You do not have to sacrifice yourself,
you and your work, your husband.
And the pill, it does exist.
Abortion, too, today.
Jean-Charles cons.
But it's your body,
darling.
It's up to you.
I made my decision, Mom.
I want to keep this child.
Very good.
I no longer
to rejoice for you.
I ask one thing:
Do not get divorced.
Dad does not bear
and me either.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Oh, the little rascals.
- Jean-Charles confirmed to me
In Tunisia labor is good.
There may be workers
for almost nothing.
We think it would be
a good idea.
Suzanne, do not forget
call Reeve
Christmas for the kids of the factory.
I will ask Miss Nadège.
I will be busy
the next few days.
What you have to do?
I have not told you?
I am running for election
Babin legislative cons.
Are you crazy?
No. Just a woman of the 80s.
Mama, we're still in 1978.
You reproach me to live in
the past. I take the lead!
Hello, sir.
I'm Suzanne Pujol.
Delighted.
I am running for election.
When I was little, my father,
we went to a farm.
There is one
called Rose.
"Rose"?
I have one called Plum
and the other Falbala.
"Falbala?
That is fermented milk?
It's milk that is 37 degrees
that we mix with
rennet, and is drained.
Then you put them ...
That's it.
Chabrechou the nettle.
It is a kind
Saint-Paulin.
If I am elected, I will defend
at the General Meeting National.
We really need.
To you, to us!
Chabrechou, it is crazy.
In Chabrechou!
Hold. I'm your candidate.
Look, miss.
Thank you.
Hello, Lawrence.
Vote for me.
Ms. Pujol
I'm glad to see you.
Nadège, how are you?
Oh, it's difficult.
Everything is back as before.
Vote for me.
I will improve things.
I intend to do.
I wanted to tell you one thing.
What you do, it amazes me.
Thank you, Nadège.
I understand that a woman can
succeed without a man.
I am Ms. Pujol.
I am running for election.
I'm for reconciliation
and the well-being.
I have no label.
You spoke to Mr. The cure?
Yes.
He will vote for us.
That's good.
He is very influential.
That's true.
I will finally
Floriane meet?
No. It is not there.
It does not come on weekends?
It was broken.
My God!
You told me nothing.
Not because of me, I hope.
Somehow, though.
You are the woman
The most important of my life.
You exaggerate.
I'm your mom.
You have not presented
this nice young man
which helps us to produce the leaflets.
It was Jean-François.
He came of itself
to offer tenure.
He adores him as well.
- I understand that people vote
for us with this beautiful boy.
You have a family resemblance.
He is the son of the notary,
Ms. Balestra.
Your father will be pleased.
What?
Thou hast broken
with Floriane.
His son with a pastry ...
Here, Jacqueline.
March 12,
Vote for Ms. Pujol.
You never go out,
but there, it's worth it.
Ah, Nadège.
Hello. Ca va?
You want to get rid of Babin?
It's time.
Vote Babin. March 12.
Your father, okay?
Let him come March 12.
Hello. Feeling well?
Remember
March 12, vote Babin.
Very good cheese.
March 12, at the polls.
Thank you. Hello to your wife.
What's this?
Ah, that Pujol.
In leaflets, the leaflets!
Babin Vote!
Hello, sir.
I think everyone.
She took a facelift.
She had to go on a diet.
Hello.
Hello, Ms. Pujol.
Hello.
Good luck.
Ms. Pujol, you know me?
No.
I worked 40 years
from your dad.
He loved me very much.
Oh yeah?
You know,
I had 11 children.
11 children!
They have all worked at the plant.
Thank you for what you did
for me and my family.
But it's nothing.
Goodbye.
March 12.
I count on you.
Vote Suzanne Pujol.
Is that you, bitch, do
propaganda in my plant?
I never would
such a thing.
Counter
your interests!
If I learn that it's you
the eye of Moscow
you'll be fired.
The tribunal will be delighted
collect my secrets
on the plant operation.
I will not mind, Suzanne?
No. I finished reading
this report.
It's crazy:
They want to delete
Road
Saint-Amand-les-Eaux.
I can sleep with you?
What happened to you?
Listen, I still work.
And we'll divorce.
It will complicate things.
You're so cute.
Why do not you go to Badaboum?
It closed on Thursday.
What are you thinking?
To us.
An old story.
No.
Remember
our honeymoon?
I remember a wild beach
in the depths of Brittany.
It was a deserted cove.
The sun was setting.
The sea was cool.
- She looked so hot
in your arms.
- It seemed so blue
in your eyes.
- We were young, beautiful,
heedless.
- We loved each other.
Why divorce
after all these years?
What's the point?
So you look at me
differently.
I look at you differently.
Tell me something, Robert?
You'll vote for me?
- Joëlle Hersant.
- Voted.
- Hubert Barbin.
- Voted.
- Ms. Pilar Sanchez.
Voted.
Ms. Gilberte Pacot.
André Ferron.
Voted.
Mr. Babin!
So how did it go?
- Maurice Babin.
Voted.
- Mr. Babin
what are your predictions?
Listen, I'm confident.
- Geneviève Michonneau.
Miss Dumoulin Nadège.
Robert Pujol.
Voted.
The world?
Yes. It is jostling.
"It is jostling?
Ms. Joelle Pujol
of Morette.
Voted.
I hope that you will win.
Thank you.
Hello, Ms. Pujol.
Hello.
Suzanne Pujol.
Voted.
Your predictions?
No comment.
Final results are in, mother.
Leave me alone for a moment?
Sure.
Hello?
Good evening, Ms. Pujol.
Do you accept the result?
Yes
Why?
You have not stuffed ballot boxes.
Seriously,
you're not too disappointed?
Unless your husband.
You think?
That your real opponent
it was not me but him.
Maybe.
While we remain friends?
Your new position will
compel us to meet often.
Of course
And mostly we face.
I look forward to.
Mother,
people begin to arrive.
Excuse me, I must go.
See you soon, Ms. MP.
A very fast, Mr. Le ...
Mr. Mayor.
Please.
Good evening, everybody.
Thank you for being here.
I ask you kindly
welcome our new member,
Suzanne Pujol!
Good evening.
SUZANNE! SUZANNE! SUZANNE!
My friends, let me first
thank you
for electing me in the first round.
I also want to testify
in brotherhood ...
We won! We won!
Yes, we won.
I also want to testify
in brotherhood
our mayor, Maurice Babin
all my respect
and all my friends too.
In this moving night victory
I can only have one thought
excited for my father
that would have been so proud of her daughter.
And it is in his memory
solemnly declare that I want
me, Suzanne Pujol
Michonneau born,
I will continue dad's work,
benefactor of this city.
She was divorced from the boss?
No.
I do not care.
She's my boss.
She proposed to be
his parliamentary assistant.
My dream today
becoming your MP
would open a huge umbrella
and keep you
tight around me,
to shelter you, to pamper you.
Because you are all
children, my children.
MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY!
MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY!
That's what I want to be
for you: A mom.
For 30 years,
I am contented
keep the house of Mr. Pujol.
Few months have sufficed
to put its plant in order.
Why not try
with France?
* After centuries
of oppression and slavery,
women must
regain power.
It is time to return
at the time of matriarchy
and blessed time of the Amazons.
And I took Mom
for a vase.
Vase, perhaps,
but certainly not a pitcher.
The wind in my hair blond
The sun on the horizon
A few words of a song
How beautiful
It's beautiful, life
A bird that makes the wheel
On a tree already red
And his cry above all
How beautiful
It's beautiful, life
* Anything that shakes and quivers
Anything that fights and fights
* Everything I thought too soon
Ever lost for me
Can still watch
Can still listen
And especially to sing
* How beautiful
It's beautiful, life
* The red open flower
From a neon shakes
Our two shadows surprised
How beautiful
It's beautiful, life
All I have almost lost
All I restored
Today I rise to the lips
At the end of the day
Yet able to share
My youth, my ideas
With love found
How beautiful
It's beautiful, life
* Being able to talk to you again
* Provide more kiss
* Te saying and singing
Yes, it's beautiful
Beautiful Life!
Yes, it's beautiful
Beautiful Life ...
