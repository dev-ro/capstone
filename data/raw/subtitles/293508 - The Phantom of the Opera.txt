very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster.
Our workshops have repaired it and wired
parts of it for the new electric light
Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago
with a little illumination, gentlemen
Paris 1870
"Opera Populaire"
"La Carlotta"
This trophy from our saviours,
From our saviours
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame
With feasting and dancing and song,
tonight in celebration,
we greet the victorious throng,
returned to bring salvation!
Vicomte, welcome
The trumpets of Carthage resound!
Hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to our step on the ground!
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return to find the land we love
threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way,
for a new production of Chalumeau's 'Hannibal'.
M. Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
M. Reyer, Mme. Giry, ladies and gentlemen, please,
if I can have your attention, thank you
As you know, for some weeks there
have been rumours of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true,
and it is my pleasure to introduce to you
the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire,
M. Richard Firmin and M. Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you've read that recent fortune in the junk business
scrap metal, actually
He must be rich
And we're deeply honored to introduce
our new patron, the Vicomte de Chagny
It's Raoul, before my father died, at the house by the sea...
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts
He called me Little Lotte
Christine, he's so handsome
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts
Especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire
Gentlemen, Signora Carlitta Guidicelli
our leading soprano for five seasons now.
Bravo! Bravo!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honour, Signor. I believe
I'm keeping you for your rehearsal
I will be here this evening to
share your great triumph
My apologies, monsieur
Thank you, M. Le Vicomte, once more
if you please, Signor
He love me, he love me
He wouldn't recognize me
He didn't see you
If you please, monsieur
We take a particular pride in the
excellence of our ballets, monsieur
I see why, especially that little blonde angel
My daughter, Meg Giry
And that exceptional beauty, no relation I trust
Christine Daae, promising talent
M. Firmin, very promising
Daae, you say? No relation to the
famous Swedish violinist?
His only child, orphaned at seven when she came
to live and trained in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you said?
I think of her as a daughter also
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side
Hannibals friends!
Oh no, not on my dress, why?
The trumpeting elephants sound -
hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to their step on the ground -
hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Ah Daae, all that they want is your dancing
Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala
He's excited by dancing girls as your new managers
Because I will not be singing
Goodbye, everyone
Now it's finished
Get my doggie, bring my doggie. Bye bye
What do we do?
- Grovel, grovel, grovel
- Right
See you later, because I'm going out
It is finished
Principessa. Bella diva
- Si si
- Goddess of song
Mr. Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous
aria for Elisa in Act Three of 'Hannibal'?
Yes, yes, yes. Ma no!
Because I have not my costume for act 3
because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
I wonder, Signora, as a personal favour
if you would oblige us
with a private rendition
Unless, of course, M. Reyer objects...
No. Aspetta, aspetta.
(No, Attesa, attesa)
If my managers command...
M. Reyer?
if My diva commands?
Yes, I do
Everybody be quiet
Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring?
My health
I see
You as well
Signora?
Maestro.
Think of me, think of me, fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart...
Signora!
He's here:the Phantom of the Opera...
Signora! Are you all right?
Buquet! For God's sake, man, what's going on there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me:
as God's my judge, I was not at my post.
Please, monsieur,
there's no one there:
Or if there is, well then, it must be a ghost...
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past years, these things do happen
And did you stop them from happening? No!
And you two, you are as bad as them, these things do happen
Until you stop these things from happening
This thing does not happen!
Ubaldo! Andiamo!
Bring my doggy, and my boxy
Amateurs!
Now you see. Byebye I'm leaving
Gentlemen. Good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.
God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
He welcomes you to his opera house
His opera house?
And commands that you continue to?
leave Box Five empty for his use and
reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty
thousand francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more,
with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight
when the Vicomte was to join us at the gala
But obviously we shall now have to cancel
as it appears we have lost our star.
There should be a understudy
Understudy? There is no understudy for La Carlotta
A full house, Andre, we shall have to refund a full house.
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
The chorus girl? Don't be silly
She's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
Who?
I don't know his name, monsieur
Let her sing for you, monsieur. She has been well taught.
Alright, come on, don't be shy,
come on, come on
Just, just...
- From the beginning of the aria, mademoiselle
Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
She's very pretty
Think of me, think of me fondly,
when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while -
please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long to
take your heart back and be free.
If you ever find a moment,
spare a thought for me...
We never said our love was evergreen,
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me...
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen -
Don't think about the ways
things might have been...
Think of me, think of me
waking silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard
to put you from my mind
Recall those days,
look back on all those times
Thinks of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
when I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seem so long ago,
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me, but I remember her
Flower fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have their season so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Bravo
Magnifica! Stupenda!
"Gustave Daae"
Bravo, bravo, bravissimi
Christine, Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor
Meg
When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever I come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I would be protected by an angel
An angel of music
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father has tutored you?
who... who
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you are talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angel of Music
Guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Who is this angel
This...
Angle of Music
Hide no longer
Secret and strange angel
He's with me, even now
Your hands are cold
All around you
Your face, Christine, is white
It frightens me
Don't be frightened
No, no
You did very well, my dear
He's pleased with you
Ah, Vicomte, I think we've made
quite a discovery with Miss Daae
Perhaps we can present her to you, dear Vicomte
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one
visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you
It would appear they've met before
Yes
Little Lotte let her mind wonder
Little Lottie thought: Am I fonder of dolls
or of goblins or shoes
Raoul
or of riddles or frocks
Those picnics in the attic
or of chocolates?
Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
'No - what I love best', Lottie said,
'is when I'm asleep in my bed'
'and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!'
'The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!'
Oh, you' sang like an angel tonight
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child'
'I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been
visited by the Angel of Music.
Oh, no doubt of it - And now we'll go to supper!
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
Raoul, no
You must change. I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes, Little Lottie.
No, Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion
basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor,
sharing in my triumph!
Angel! I hear you!
Speak, I listen...
stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak -
forgive me...
Enter at last, Master!
Flattering child
you shall know me,
see why in shadow I hide!
Look at your face in the mirror -
I am there inside!
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music
Christine, Christine
Come to me: Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
My/Your spirit and your/my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
I have brought you
to the seat of sweet music's throne
to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music
music
You have come here,
for one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing,
I have needed you with me,
to serve me, to sing,
for my music...
my music...
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation.
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light -
and listen to the music of the night...
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar!
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind,
in this darkness that you know you cannot fight
the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey
through a strange, new world!
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before!
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation!
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Christine
Like yellow parchment is his skin...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...
You must be always on your guard,
or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
Those who speak of what they know
Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I remember there was mist
swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around,
and on the lake there was a boat,
and in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you...
Curse you...
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look
or bear to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell,
but secretly yearns for heaven,
secretly...
Christine...
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see
to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast
but secretly dreams of beauty,
secretly...
Oh, Christine...
Come we must return
Those two fools Who run my
theatre Will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night,"
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!"
"Mystified all the papers say,
we are mystified -
we suspect foul play!"
Bad news on soprano scene -
First Carlotta, now Christine!
Still, at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold...
What a way to run a business!
Spare me these unending trials!
Half your cast disappears,
but the crowd still cheers!
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hint!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre, please don't shout...
It's publicity!
And the take is vast!
Free publicity!
But we have no cast...
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala!
Christine was in a word sublime!
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left -
On that note the diva is a disaster
must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?!
"Dear Firmin,
just a brief reminder:
my salary has not been paid.
Send it care of the ghost,
by return of post
P.T.O.:
No-one likes a debtor,
so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain!
These are both signed "O.G."...
Who the hell is he?
Opera ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He's mucking our position!
In addition he wants money
What a funny aberration to expect a large retainer!
Nothing plainer -he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae -where is she?
Well, how should we know?
I want an answer -
I take it that you sent me this note
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you, then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark...
Monsieur, don't argue -
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it, that we're meant
to have wrote? Written!
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again. "
If you didn't write it, who did?
Where is he?
Ah, welcome back!
Your precious patron -
where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter -
a letter which I rather resent!
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me, that this
is not the letter you sent?!
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing
on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune,
should you attempt to take her place. "
Far too many notes for my taste -
and most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name...
Miss Daae has returned
I hope no worse for wear as far as we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best that she was
alone... She needed rest
May I see her?
No, monsieur, she will see no-one.
Will she sing?
Here, I have a note...
Let me see it!
Please!
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you
several notes of the most amiable nature,
detailing how my theatre is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance..."
Christine Daae has returned to you,
and I am anxious her career should progress.
In the new production of "Il Muto",
you will therefore cast Carlotta as the Pageboy,
and put Miss Daae in the role of Countess.
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal.
The role of the Pageboy is silent -
which makes my casting, in a word, ideal.
I shall watch the performance from my normal
seat in Box Five, which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored, a disaster
beyond your imagination will occur.
"I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, O.G."
Christine!
It's all a ploy to help Christine!
Whatever next...?
It's all about a ploy to help Christine
This is insane...
I know who sent this:The Vicomte - her lover!
Indeed? Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!This is a joke!
This changes nothing!
O mentitori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora...
The man is mad!
We don't take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the Pageboy - the silent role...
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those...
You have reviled me!
The angel sees, the angel knows
You have rebuked me!
Signora, pardon us...?
You have replaced me!
Please, Signora, we beseech you...
This hour shall see your darkest fears...
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr
What new surprises lie in store?
Our star...!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae
Your public needs you! We need you, too!
Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue?
Signora, no!
The world wants you!
Prima donna first lady of the stage!
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you!
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you!
Prima donna, enchant us once again!
Think of your muse... And of the queues round the theatre!
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Christine spoke of an angel...
Prima donna, your song shall live again!
- Think of your public!
- You took a snub, but there's a public who needs you!
- She has heard the voice of the angel of music...
- Those who hear your voice liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry of undying support!
We get our opera
She gets her limelight!
Leading ladies are a trial!
Prima donna, your song shall never die!
You'll sing again, and to unending ovation!
- Orders! Warnings!Lunatic demands!
- Tears... oaths... lunatic demands are regular occurrences!
Think how you'll shine in that final encore!
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this!
Think, before these demands are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl,
who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette,
entwined in love's duet!
Although he may deny,
he must have been with her!
You'd never get away with all this in a play,
but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue
it's just the sort of story audiences adore,
in fact a perfect opera!
Prima donna the world is at your feet!
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light up the stage with that age old rapport!
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Oh, go go
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing-stock!
Should he suspect her, God protect her!
Shame! Shame! Shame!
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame! Shame! Shame!
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
That's exactly something the public loves
My love, I am called to England on affairs of State,
and must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving!
That's the Countess de Cherbourg
She's invited us to her salon, you know
Nothing like that ever happened to us in the junk business
Scrap metal
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha,Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera...
It's him
Your part is silent, little toad!
A toad, madame? Perhaps it is you who are the toad...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Hahahahaha!?
Bring the curtain in. Please.
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize,
the performance will continue in ten minutes' time...
...when the role of the Countess
will be played by Miss Daae.
Until then, we will crave your
indulgence for a few moments
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the
ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
what?
Maestro, the ballet, bring forth, please
The ballet
The ballet, now, please
One moment, thank you
Thank you
You're fired
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It's simple an accident... an accident
Why have you brought me here?
We can't go back there!
We must return!
He'll kill you!
His eyes will find us there!
Christine, don't say that...
Those eyes that burn!
Don't even think it...
And if he has to kill a thousand men -
Forget this waking nightmare...
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
This phantom is a fable...
Believe me...
... and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
My God, who is this man...
...who hunts to kill...?
...this mask of death...?
I can't escape from him...
Whose is this voice you hear...
...I never will!
...with every breath...?
And in this labyrinth,
where night is blind
the Phantom of the Opera is there/here:
inside your/my mind...
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
Raoul, I've been there -
to his world of unending night...
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness...
darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face
in that darkness...
darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit
with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
Yet in his eyes
all the sadness of the world...
Those pleading eyes,
that both threaten and adore...
Christine...
Christine...
Christine...
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you -
my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom,
let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you,
to guard you and to guide you...
Say you love me every waking moment,
turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true
that's all I ask of you...
Let me be your shelter, let me be your light.
You're safe: No one will find you
your fears are far behind you...
All I want is freedom,
a world with no more night... and you,
always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...
Then say you'll share with me
one love, one lifetime...
let me lead you from your solitude...
Say you need me with you here, beside you...
anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...
say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me,
each night, each morning...
Say you love me...
You know I do...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
Anywhere you go let me go too...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!
And soon you'll be beside me!
You'll guard me, and you'll guide me...
I gave you my music...
made your song take wing...
and now how you've repaid me:
denied me and betrayed me...
He was bound to love you
when he heard you sing...
Christine...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...
say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me,
each night, each morning...
You will curse the day you did not do
all that the Phantom asked of you...!
"Bal Masque"
M'sieur Andre?
M'sieur Firmin?
Dear Andre, what a splendid party!
The prologue to a bright new year!
Quite a night! I'm impressed!
Well, one does one's best...
Here's to us! The toast for the city
What a pity that 'Phantom' can't be here.
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade..
Masquerade!
Look around -
there's another mask behind you!
Flash of mauve.. Splash of puce...
Fool and king... Ghoul and goose...
Green and black... Queen and priest...
Trace and rouge... Face of beast...
Faces...
Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round...
in an inhuman race...
Eye of gold... Thigh of blue...
True is false... Who is who...?
Crul of lip... Swirl of gown...
Ace of hearts... Face of clown...
Faces...
Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned
in the light...
in the sound...
But who can name the face...
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill -
let the spectacle astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadows, breathing lies...
Masquerade!
You can fool any friend who ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes...
Masquerade!
Run and hide -
but a face will still pursue you!
What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme de la creme!
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears are in the past!
Six months...
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghosts!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast: to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
to the hear
And may its splendour never
fade! Six months! What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it! A secret engagement!
Look - your future bride!
Just think of it!
But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me
No, Raoul, please don't do this
Well, let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime!
Christine, What are you afraid of?
Let's not argue...
Let's not argue...
Please pretend...
I can only hope I'll...
You will...
...understand in time...
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade!
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade!
Masquerade!
Look around -
There's another mask behind you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill -
let the spectacle astound you!
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera!
Here I bring the finished score
"Don Juan Triumphant"!
Fondest greetings to you all!
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts:
Carlotta must be taught to act, not her normal trick
of strutting round the stage.
Our Don Juan must lose some weight -
it's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age.
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts.
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best - it's true her voice is good.
She knows, though, should she wish to excel
she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher...
Your chains are still mine
You belong to me
Madame Giry. Madame Giry...
Please, Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.
That's not true.
Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents
Accidents? Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes...
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a travelling fair in the city.
Gypsies
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina
One of many
Living in the dormitory of the opera house
Come, come, come inside
Come and see the devil's child
? the devil's child
Devil's child
Murder, murder
Which way?
...way
I have hidden him from the world and its cruelties
He has known nothing else of life since then
Except this opera house
It was his playground and now his artistic domain
He's a genius, he's an architect and designer
He's a composer and a magician
A genius, monsieur
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness
Monsieur
Ou vas tu, mademoiselle?
The cemetery
To my father's grave, please
Where have they gone?
Oh, the cemetery
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her...
Her father promised her
You were once my one companion...
you were all that mattered...
You were once a friend and father -
then my world was shattered...
Wishing you were somehow here again...
wishing you were somehow near...
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed,
somehow you would be here...
Wishing I could hear your voice again...
knowing that I never would...
Dreaming of you won't help me to do,
all that you dreamed I could!
Passing bells and sculpted angels,
cold and monumental.
Seem, for you, the wrong companions,
you were warm and gentle.
Too many years fighting back tears,
why can't the past just die!
Wishing you were somehow here again,
knowing we must say goodbye!
Try to forgive, teach me to live!
Give me the strength to try!
No more memories, no more silent tears!
No more gazing across the wasted years!
Help me say goodbye...
help me say goodbye!
Wandering child,
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father?
Friend or phantom?
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
Wildly my mind beats against you
You resist
Yet your/the soul obeys...
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector
Come to me/your strange Angel...
I am your Angel of Music...
Come to me; Angel of Music
No, Christine, wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you believe,
this man - this thing - is not your father!
No, Raoul, no
Not like this
Now, let it be war upon you both!
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening...
Go on.
We shall play his game
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the doors are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end!
Raoul, I'm frightened...
Don't make me do this
Raoul, it scares me,
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever...
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there,
singing songs in my head...
He'll always be there,
singing songs in my head...
You said yourself,
He was nothing but a man...
Yet while he lives,
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse...
And yet, I wish I could
Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope, and every prayer
rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
"Don Juan"
Here the sire may serve the dam,
here the master takes his meat!
Here the sacrificial lamb
utters one despairing bleat!
Poor young maiden! For the thrill
on your tongue of stolen sweets
you will have to pay the bill -
tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that, when
tables, plans and maids are laid,
Don Juan triumphs once again!
Passarino, faithful friend,
once again recite the plan.
Your young guest believes I'm you -
I, the master, you, the man
When you met you wore my cloak,
she cannot see your face.
She believes she dines with me,
in her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff,
stealing what, in truth, is mine.
When it's late and modesty
starts to mellow, with the wine...
You come home! I use your voice -
slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say: "come - hide with me!
Where, oh, where? Of course - my room!"
Poor thing hasn't got a chance!
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured,
if I do not forget myself and laugh...
No thoughts
within her head,
but thoughts of joy!
No dreams
within her heart
but dreams of love!
Master?
Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey...
You have come here
in pursuit of your deepest urge,
in pursuit of that wish,
which till now has been silent,
silent...
I have brought you,
that our passions may fuse and merge -
in your mind
you've already succumbed to me
dropped all defences
completely succumbed to me -
now you are here with me:
no second thoughts,
you've decided,
decided...
Past the point of no return -
no backward glances:
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when" -
no use resisting:
abandon thought,
and let the dream descend...
What raging fire shall flood the soul
What rich desire unlocks its door
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets
Will we learn
beyond the point of no return?
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence
Silence.
I have come here,
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent,
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided.
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now at last begun.
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud burst into bloom
When will the flames at last consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return.
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you'll want me
With you here
Beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of...
Go!
Oh,?
You left before me
Oh my God
We'll run, Andre, run
Where did he take her?
Come with me, monsieur
I will take you to him
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I'll go with you
No, Meg, you must stay here
Come with me, monsieur
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness,
deep as hell
Why, you ask,
was I bound and chained
in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin
but the wickedness of my abhorrent face
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why, why...?
Your hand at the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go
Thank you
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh...
This face, the infection which poisons our love...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest
Sir!
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped that you would come
And now my wish comes true
You have truly made my night!
Let me go!
Free her
Do what you like, only free her
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea
Please, Raoul, it's useless
I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her
Show some compassion
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine...
Let me see her
Be my guest, sir...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes
Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice,
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate,
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me
I did it all for you, and all for nothing...
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered
Too late for turning back, Too late for prayers and useless pity
Say you love him, and my life is over!
All hope of cries for help, No point in fighting
For either way you choose, You cannot win
Either way you choose, he has to win
So do you end your days with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Angel of Music...
Past the point of no return...
Christine say no!
Who deserved this?
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
The final threshold...
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
Why do you curse mercy?
I fought so hard to free you...
Angel of Music... you deceived me
You've passed the point of no return!
I gave you my mind blindly
You try my patience,
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness,
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone...
Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Take her, forget me,
Forget all of this...
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat, swear to me, never to tell
The secret you know, of the angel in hell!
Go now - go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You alone, can make my song take flight
It's over now, the music of the night
"Countess de Chagny
Beloved wife and mother"
"Chrisine 1854-1917"
Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you?
You've always known
Your heart was on its own
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived
Life can be loved
Alone.
