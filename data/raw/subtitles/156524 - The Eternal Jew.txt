The civilized Jews
we know in Germany...
give us but
an incomplete picture...
of their true racial character.
The film shows actual shots
of the Polish ghettos.
It shows the Jews
as they really look...
before concealing themselves...
behind the mask of civilized
Europeans.
The campaign in Poland gave us the opportunity
to really get to know the Jewish people.
Nearly four million Jews
live here in Poland.
but they won't be found among
the rural population.
Nor have they suffered from the chaos of war,
as has the native Pole.
They sat it out indifferently in the gloomy
streets of the Polish ghetto.
Yet within an hour after the German
occupation they were back in business.
We Germans had a look
at the Polish ghetto 25 years ago.
This time our eyes are sharpened
by our experience in the last few decades.
Unlike in 1914, we no longer see
just the most grostesque...
and comoical of these
qusetionable ghetto figures.
This time we recognize
that there's a plague here:
a plague that threatens
the health of the Aryan people.
Richard Wagner once said
"the jew is the demon behind
the corruption of mankind".
and there pictures prove it.
Jewish home like reveals remarkable lack
of creative ability to civilize.
In plain language, Jewish dwellings are
filthy and neglected.
These Jews are't at all poor.
After decades of business,
they've hoarded enough...
to acquire decent,
comfortable homes.
But they live for generations
in the same dirty and bug-ridden dwellings.
Untroubled by their surroundings,
they go right on with their prayers.
The bobbing motion is part of the ritual
for reading Jewish scriptures.
The main part of Jewish so-called community life
takes place in the street.
Seldom are Jews found
going useful work.
And when they are, as here,
it often isn't voluntary.
The German military government
is making them clear away rubble.
It appears that they're not used
to working, abd don't like it either.
This isn't helplessness
that's to be pitied.
These Jews don't want to work,
but barterl Here, they're in their element.
It's not true that Jews are
forced into trade because other
professions are clised to them.
On the contrary,
they welcome trade eagerly.
because it suits their character
and natural inclination.
One might want to regard these
haggling children as a sign
of great proverty.
But watch them awhile,
and it becomes clear...
that they're proud
to act as their grownups do.
These young people don't have
the idealism that ours do.
With them, the egoism of the individucal
is not in the service of higher common goals.
Instead, Jewish morality,
in crass contradiction of
the Aryan concept of ethics,
proclaims the unrestrained egoism
of every Jew to be divine law.
His religion males cheating
and usury a duty.
In the fifth book of Moses,
for example, it is stated...
that a non-Jew thou may loan
to upon usury but not thy brother,
that the Lord may bless thee
in all thy dealings.
For the Jews, then, doing
business is something holy.
This is totally incomprehensible
to non-Jews.
Aryan man attaches
a sense of worth to every activity.
He wants to creat something
worthwhile: food or clothing,
houses or machines,
works of art or anything else
of value to everyone.
He's ruled by the feeling of
being responsible for his achievements.
For the Jews there's but
one thing of value: money.
How he gets it
makes no dofference.
The first trade goods are
generally worthless trash of all sorts.
That's how the little
Jews start out.
Soon they've reached the point
where they can sell from a tray,
and before long they've
assembled a complete line of goods.
Not long after,
they own a regulat stand.
The most ambitious soon own
a small shop, and then a bigger shop.
The most cunning that is,
the most inscrupulous...
eventually have
warehouses and banks,
and move into the most splendid
mansions in the cities,
provided that they don't
get in each others' way,
as in the narrow
ghettos of the East.
That's why they try to escape
to rich lands with rich people.
They need other people,
because they need the wares
with which to do business.
What creative Aryan people
find of value has been reduced
by the Jew to mere merchandise.
He buys and sells,
but produces nothing.
The production he leaves to
the workers and farmers of the host nation.
The Jews are people without
farmers or workers: a race of parasites.
Wherever the body of a nation
shows a wound,
they anchor themselves and
feed on the decaying organism.
They make business
out of the sickness of the nations,
and therefore endeavor to deepen
and prolong all conditions of sickness.
That's how it is in Poland,
and was in Germany.
The Jews have been this way
throughout their entire history.
Their faces bear the age-old features
of the perpetual sponger: the eternal Jew,
who in the course of time
and worldwide wanderings has
always been the same.
There's no difference between
these Jews in Poland and
those in Palestine,
thought the two are
geographically separated.
Palestine is the spiritual
center of international Jewry,
though the Jews are numerically
insignificant there.
Here at the Wailing Wall,
they gather and mourn
the fall of Jerusalem.
Theit homelessness, though,
is a matter of choice,
and in keeping with
their entire history.
Four thousand years ago,
their Hebrew ancestors were
already wandering.
Out of the Land of Two Rivers,
they wandered along the sea to Egypt,
wher they ran a lucrative
grain business for a while.
When the country farmers
and other Wgyptians...
rose aganist the foreign
usurers and speculators,
they wandered once more,
and plundered their way
to the promised land.
They settled there, mercilessly
looting culturally-superior
rightful inhabitants.
Here in the course
of centuries, from the Oriental,
Far Eastern racial mixture...
with Negroid admixture,
the ultimate mongrelized
Jews developed.
Foreign from us Europeans,
born of totally-different racial elements,
they differ from us in body
and above all n soul.
We probably would never have
been bothered by them had they
stayed in their Oriental home.
But the cosmopolitan empire of
Alexander the Great,
reaching from the Near East
across half the Mediterranean,
and especially the boundless
world empire of the Romans,
brought about the evolution
of the trade and migratory
traits of the Jews,
who soon spread across
the open Mediterranean area.
While some of them settled in
the large urban traffic...
and the trade centers of
the Mediterranean,
others wandered relentlessly on
across Spain, France, Southern
Germany, and England.
Everywher they made
themselves unwelcome.
In Spain and France the people
rose openly aganist them in the
13th and 14th Centuries,
and they wandered on,
mainly to Germany.
From there they followed
the path of the Aryan culture...
creative Germans
colonizing the East...
till they finally found a gigantic
new untapped reservoir...
in the Polish and Russian sections
of Eastern Europe.
The 19th Century,
with its muddled ideas about
human equality and freedom,
gave the Jews a great lift.
From eastern Europe they spread
across the entire continent...
during the 19th and 20th Centuries,
and then across the world.
Parallel to these Jewish
wanderings throughout the world
is the migration of...
a similarly restless
animal: the rat.
Rats have been parasites
on mankind from the very beginning.
Their home is Asia, from shich
they migrated in gigantic hordes...
over Russia and the Balkans
into Europe.
By the middle of the 18th Century,
they'd already spread over all of Europe.
Toward the end of
the 19th Centiry,
with growing shipping traffic, they took
possession of America as well,
and eventually Africa
and the Far East.
Wherever rats turn up,
they carry destruction to the land...
by destroying mankind's goods
and nourishment and spreading
diseases and plagues...
such as cholera, dysentery,
leprosy, and typhoid fever.
They are cunning. cowardly, and cruel,
and usually appear in massive hordes.
They represent the elements of
sneakiness and subterranean
destruction among animals,
just as the Jews
do among mankind.
The parasite nation of Judah
is responsible for a large part
of international crime.
In 1932 the Jews, who made up only 1%
of the world's population,
accounted for 34% of the world's
dope peddlers, 47% of robberies,
47% of crooked games of chance,
82% of international crime organizations,
and 98% of dealers
in prostitution.
The most-common experssions in the jargon
of international gangsters and criminals...
tem from Hebrew
and Yidddish words.
These physiognmies immediately
refute the liberal theories...
abut the equality of all who
bear a human countenance.
The Jews alter
their outward appearnce...
when they leave their Polis haunts
for the rich world.
Theit hair, beard, skull cap,
and caftan make the Eastern Jew
recognizable to everyone.
Should he remove them,
only sharp-eyed people
can spot his racia origins.
An essential trait of the Jew
is that he always tries...
to hide his origin
when among non-Jews.
A bunch of Polish Jews
still wearing caftans...
and now in Western
European clothes,
prepare to infiltrate
Western civilization.
Of course these ghetto Jews
don't yet move too well in
their clean European clothes.
Somewhat more adept are
the Jews of Berlin.
Their fathers and grandfathers
lived in the ghetto,
but that is not
outwardly noticeable.
Here, in the second and third generation,
the assimilation has reached its zenith.
Outwardly, they try to act
just like the host people.
People without good instincrs let themselves
be deceived by this mimicry,
and consider Jews
the same as they are.
Therein lies the enormos danger:
These assimilated Jews
remain forever foreign bodies...
in the organisms of their host people,
regardless of appearances.
Even aristprats with
pld Jewidh names,
who've intermarried with
the Aryan nobility for generations,
and are part of European "high society",
remain foreign bodies.
Here we show a scene from a film about
the Rothschild family.
It was made
by American Jews,
obviously as a tribute to one of
the greatest names in Jewish history.
They honor their hero in a
typically Jewish manner,
delighting in the way old Meier Amschel
Rothschild cheats his host state...
by feigning proverty
to avoid paying taxes.
Transfer of money by check
is not a Jewish invention,
nor was it cultivated by Jews
for the good of mankind.
It served them as
a means of obtaining...
international influence over
their host people.
So Nathan goes to London
and becomes an Englishman.
Jacob goes to Paris
and becomes a Frenchman.
Salamon goes to Vienna
and becomes an Austrian.
Carl goes to Naples
and becomes an Italian.
Amschel stays in Frankfurt
and remains a German.
But of course
they all remain Jews.
Therefore, when during
the French Revolution...
Jews became rightful citizens
of their respective host nations,
they each belonged to
two nations at the same time.
It's not for nothing that they
have blood relations at all
Wuropean courts,
and are therefore intimately
acquainted with what goes on
at these courts...
and in the countries
they preside over...
in this century of
ibdustry and progress.
Jewish business blooms
as never before.
The House of Rothschild is
just one example of the use
of this tactic by the Jews...
to spread their net of financial influence
over the working man.
The House of Warburg follows the same tactic,
as do other Jewish banking families.
By the beginning of the 20th Century,
the Jews are sitting...
at all junctions of
the world's money market.
They are an international power.
Though they make up only 1%
of the population of the Earth,
their capital enables them to...
terrorize world exchanges,
world opinion, and world politics.
New York is today's chief center
of Jewish power.
The New York stock exchange, financial center
of the world, is ruled by such...
Jewish banking houses as Kuhn, Loeb,
Warburg, Hanauer, Wertheim, Levisohn,
Seligmann, Guggenheim, Wolf,
Schiff, Strauss, Stern, and so forth.
These Jewish kings of finance love to play
out their power behind the scenes...
and stay out of the limelight.
Outwardly, they fit right in
with their hosts.
They look almost like
genuine Americans.
Bernard Baruch, Jewish financial advisor
and friend of the American President,
in the guise of a smart
citizen of the US.
Otto Kahn, Jewish banker of Wall Street,
enjoying his role as Anglo-Saxon lord.
Jewish banker Felix Warburg.
Jewish banker Mortimer Schiff.
Jewish lawyer and Geramn-hater
Samuel Untermeier.
Professor Felix Frankfurter, Jewish legal advisor
to the American President.
Herbert Lehman, Jewish governor
of the state of New York.
Laguardia, half-Jewish mayor
of New York City.
Henry Morgenthau, Jewish Secretary
of the Treasury of the Us.
The Jew Leon Blum,
former prime minister of France,
who knows how to act
just like a genuine Frenchman.
Millions of French workers
once greeted him as their party leader.
The Jew Hore Belisha,
former minister of war for England.
English soldiers salute
their commander!
But the Jew is still a rootless parasite,
even when in power,
for his power doesn't come
from his own strenghth.
It lasts only as long
as his misled hosts...
are willing to carry him
on their backs.
Remember those tragic days
when Germany lay helpless:
The Jews saw their chance;
Just like loyal citizens
they stepped forward,
as though deeply concerned
about the fate of the German people.
They rushed to the so-called
national ssembly in Weimar,
where Germany's future
was to be decided.
The jewish representative Landsberg,
on his left, Schneidemann.
The Jewish Hirsch,
prime minister of Prussia.
The Jew Theodore Wolf,
editor of a Berlin daily.
The Jew Georg Bernhard
head of the Ullstein publishing house.
The Jew Hugo Preuss,
creator of the German constitution.
The Jew Walter Rathenau,
foreign minister of Germany.
The Jew Hilferding,
German finance minister.
The Jew Bernhard Isidor Weiss,
assisant police chief in Berlin.
Meanwhile other Jews represented
the radical line aganist law and order.
In the guise of
selfless humanitarians,
They promised the masses
castles in the sky,
inciting them against
civic order.
Unrestrained personal freedom
and self indulgence for the individual.
Rejection of all ideals
and higher values.
Submission the basest life
of material pleasures.
Criticism of all that is sacred.
Revolt against everything.
Incitement of the young to
class warfare and terrorism.
It's no accident that
this doctrine of destruction of nations...
sprang from the Jewish mind:
of Karl Marx, son of Margoehei,
a rabbi and lawyer in Trier.
The founder and organizer of the
German Social Democratic Party...
was the Jew Ferdinand LaSalle-Wolfson.
The Jewess Rosa Luxenburg
real name Emma Goldman...
was a notorious
communist agitator.
The Jew Nisson was responsible for
the murder of hostages in Munich.
The Jew Frankfurter
was the murderer of...
National Socialist activist
Willeim Gustloff.
The Polish Jew Grynspan murdered
the German diplomat von Rath in Paris.
Although they were a small minority,
they knew how to terrorize
a great tolerant nation.
For every thousand Germans,
there were 10 Jews.
Or better said,
for every thousand disunified Germans
who fought among themselves,
there were 10 Jews who despite business
competition, all had a common goal:
exploiting the Germans.
The Kewish merchants
crowded into the cities.
Three-fourth of all Jews
lived in the big cities,
but not to work in the factories;
They left that to the Germans.
For every thousand workers
in Berlin, there were two Jews.
At the beginning of 1933, of 100 state
prosecutors in Berlin, 15 were Jews.
Of 100 judges
23 were Jews.
Of every 100 lawyers,
49 were Jews.
Of every 100 doctors,
52 were Jews.
Of every 100 merchants,
60 were Jews.
The average income for a German
was 810 marks.
The average income for a Jew
was 10,000 marks.
While millions of Germans
fell into unemploymet and proverty,
immigrant Jews acquired
fantastic riches in a few years.
Not through honest work, but
through usury, swindling, and fraud.
The Sklareks lightened
the Berlin treasury by 12,5 million marks.
The Jew Kutisker defrauded
Prussia of 14 million.
The Jew Barmat cheated
the same state out of 35 million.
Not to mention the
inflation profiteer Mendelsohn,
the Jew recketeer Katsenelenbogen,
and all the rest of them.
Jews are most dangerous when permitted
to meddle in a people's culture,
religion, and art, and pronounce their
insolent judgement on them.
The concept of beauty of Nordic man
is incomprehensible to the Jew by nature.
and will always reamin so.
For the purity and neatness
of the German concept of art,
the Jew, without rools of his own.
has no feeling.
What he calls art must gratify
his deteriorating nerves.
The strench of disease
must pervade it.
It must be unnatural grotesque,
perverse, or pathological.
These feverish fantasies of hopelessly
sick minds wereonce extolled by...
Jewish art critics of German public life
as high artistic expressions.
Today it seems incredible that
such pictures were once bought
by nearly all our galleries,
but Jewish art dealers
and critics praised them as
the only real modern art.
German cultural life was
niggerized and bastardized.
Painting, architecture, literature,
and music suffered as well.
For more than a decade,
Jews wielded their profane power.
As art dealers, music publishers,
editors, and critics,
they decided what would be
called art and culture in Germany.
The Jew Kerr, art czar in
the Weimar Republic.
The Jew Tucholsky,
a wicked pronographer...
who said that treason
is honorable...
and the heroic ideal
is the stupidest idea.
The Jew Hirschfeld, who promoted
homosexuality and perversion.
In the guise of
scientific discussions,
they tried to direct mankind's healthy urges
down degenerate paths.
The "relativity" Jew
Albert Einsrein, who masked...
his hatred of Germans behind
his obscure pseudo sciences.
The Jew Kestenberg, conntroller of German music
in the Prussian Ministry of Culture.
The Jew's El Dorado was the German stage.
Here they ruled unchecked,
degrading the classical tradition by appealing
to rhe basest instincts.
the Jew Haller and his revue.
The Jew Rotter, who had a monopoly
with seven theaters in Berlin,
finally skipping out
while millions in debt.
The Jewish revue director
Robert Klein.
The Jewish stage dictator
Max Reinhardt.
Most stages were
directed by Jews.
The Jewish comedians
Ehrich and Morgan.
It was no different
in the movies.
The Jewish film director
Richard Oswald.
The comedian Gerron.
Jews consider portrayal of the
disreputable and repellent...
particularly fertile ground
for comic effect.
The Jewess Rosa Valetti.
The Jew kurt Boar enjoys
a particularly perverted role.
The Jew Kurt Nakuhn extols the "virtues"
of a depraved officer...
who dosen't even shrink
from committing a murder.
The Jew is instinctively interested
in everything abnormal and depraved.
He seeks possibilities of disrupting
a people's heallty judgement.
The Jew Peter Lorre in the role
of a child murderer.
With the notion that not the murderer,
but his victim, is guilty,
normal judgement is twisted by a sympathetic
portrayal of the criminal,
to gloss over
and excuse the crime.
I can feel it,
burning within me.
I must go the way
that I'm driven.
And run, run... endless streets.
I want to get away... get away!
And with me run their ghosts;
they won't leave me alone.
I have to do it... I must.
A disproportionately great number of Jews
arrained prominence in Germany.
In newspapers and newsreels,
their Jewish cronies...
presented them to the public
as German artists.
The Jew Richard Tauber
left for New York,
and was miurned as an alleged
loss for German art.
The Jew Ernst Lubitsch was hailed
as a German film producter.
"I'm very glad to be back in Germany,
and especially my home town, Berlin".
The Jew Emil Ludwig Cohn
was honored as a German writer.
"An author can do
nothing better today...
than carry the German name
aborad with honor".
The Jew Charlie Chaplin
was welcomed by an enraptured
crowd when he visited Berlin.
Then of the German public
acclaimed the newcomer Jew.
A deadly enemy.
How could this happen?
The phony dogma
of human equality...
had tricked the healthy
instinct of the nation.
Centuries of religious upbringing
had taught European Christians...
to regard Jews as fellow founders
of the Christian religion.
Benevolent German
painters and poets...
idenalized the Biblical figures
of Hebrew tribal history.
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
were considered pillars...
of the highest moraliry
and human nobility.
But we know now that the Hebrews
of the Bible couldn't have looked like this.
We must correct
our historical view.
Here's what real
Hebrews look like.
The following is a
Jewish Purim festival,
filmed by Warsaw Jews
for their own use as a culture film.
This harmless-looking
family celebration...
commemorates the slaughter of
75,000 anti- Semitic Persians...
by Biblical ancestors
of our Jews of today.
The Bible reports that
"The next day the Jews rested,
and made the day one of
feasting, joy, and gift giving.
They decided that
these two days, Purim.
should be thereafter remembered
by their children's children, firever".
Educated Germans,
objective and tolerant,
regard such tales as just
folklore and strande customs.
But that's the race of Israel, still rubbing
its hands over its feast of revenge.
even when dressed in
the Western European clothes...
in which today's Israelites
hide their murderous nature.
To understand the serious
danger behind all this,
it's necessary to look at the moral teachings
of the Jewish race.
From boyhood, the Jew learns his ancient laws
in the Talmud schools.
As grows older, he learns more from
the books of Jewish law.
but it's not
religious instruction.
The rabbis are not peaceful theologicans,
but political educadors.
The politics of a parasite race
must be carried on in secret.
The individual ghetto Jew dowsn't necessarily
have to know all their plans.
It's enough that he's filled
with the spirit from youth ones.
What dose the ancient law
of the Tamlud teach?
"Always be cunning when afraid;
answer softly to clam the anger of the stranger,
so that you'll be loved.
Ally yourself with him
on whom fate smiles at the moment".
"Five things Canaan
taught his sons:
Love one another, love pillage,
love excess, hate your masters,
and never tell the truth".
Further development of Jewish inner life
is carried on in the synagogue.
The Jews count on people not understanding
language and ambiguous symbols.
The Black boxes on their heads
contain law passages.
Conducting business
during the service...
is not considered an act of
disrespect by Israekites.
The law teaches that "Whosoever honors
the Torah will succeed in business".
The Torah scroll, containing the five books
of Moses and the law,
is taken from the
so-called Holy Ark:
On its way to the pulpit,
Jews kiss it to ask forgiveness
for their sins.
The Torah scrpll is rolled
to the place to be read.
What sort of "truths" dose
it teach?
Hora Hajum, Verse 290:
"Praise to the Lord,
who has set apart the holy
and the common nations,
Israel and the other races.
The Heathens, who do not keep
your commandments,
you have made enemies
to be wiped out.
God's anger is on them
and he says,
even the best among
the heathens will I kill.
There are none good among the people
of the world, for they are blasphemers.
But the sons of Israel
are all righteous".
Haghida 3, Verse 1:
"And the Lord told
the Israelites:
you have made me the
one God of the the world,
and I will make your people
the only rulers of the world".
Hora Hajim 126, Verse 1:
"Glort to the Eternal One,
who reduces the enemies of your people,
humbles them and wipes them out,
that the earth may belong to
you alone and your people".
This is not a religion!
It's a comspiracy aganist all non-Jews
by a sick, deceitful, poisoned race,
aganist the Aryan people
and their moral laws.
One of the most illuminating...
customs of the Jews'
so-called religion...
is the slaughter
of animals.
The following actual scenes...
are among the most horrifying
ever captured.
We show them despite
objections about poor taste.
It's more important...
that our people know
the truth about Jewry.
Sensitive citizens
are advised not to watch.
Supposedly, their religion forbids Jews
from eating ordinarily-butchered meat.
So they let the animals bleed
to death while conscious.
The Jews deceptively describe the cruel method
as the most humane way to slaughter.
European science
has long acknowledged...
the torturous chartacter
of this type of alsughter.
In 1892, the people voted
to ban it in Switzerland.
Jewish law has no love and respect for animals
in the Germanic sense.
It's even forbidden that the suffering animal
be put out of its misery.
The National Socialist movement
has opposed this cruel...
torture of defenseless animals
since its earliest days.
In nearly all provincial
elections and in the parliament,
we moved to forbid
this form of slaughter.
But the entire Jew-controlled press
called our stand disgraceful.
In sessions in Baden,
Bavaria, and Thuringa,
the National Socialists moved to
forbid this form of slaughter,
as it is unworthy of a
civilized nation.
The Nazis, in their hate-filled
anti-Semitism,
dpn't shrink from involving
German citizens in their...
interference with time-honored
religious customs.
They claim it's just
cruelty to animals.
Objective scientists,
however, have long proven...
That this form of slaughter...
is among the
most-humane anywhere.
NAZI FANTASIES AGANIST
RITUAL SLAUGHTER
THE BATTLE AGANIST KOSHER MEAT
An objective study by
Rabbi Englebert.
In reply to many inquires...
from all circles as to whether
slaughtering animals by...
Jewish rites is really
cruelty to animals,
I'd like to say the following.
The slaughter is
actually a matter of...
EXPLANATION BY
RABBIS OF GERMANY
STORMY COUNCIL SESSION:
SCIENTISTS REFUTE NAZI LIES
ATTACK ON THE CONSTITUTION FAILS
NAZI MOTION FAILS:
HYPOCRITE "ANIMAL LOVERS"
The Jewish press could only get away with
writing this because hardly any Germans
had ever seen
a kosher slaughter.
considering the well-known German love
of animals, it would otherside have been
impossible for the Jews
to continue their cruel torture
of innocent and defenseless
animals unpunished.
These scenes prove the cruelty
of this method of slaughter.
They also reveal the character of the race
that hides its senseless brutality...
behind the gacade of
pious religious customs.
The Jewish butchers
usually bind the animals...
so that no movements
betray their agonies.
But it's customary to also sometimes
slaughter unbound animals in the way.
Right afer the FÃ¼hrer took power,
a law enacted April 21st, 1933,
forbade the Jewish
form of slaughter.
It decreed that all
warm-blooded animals...
be given anesthetic
before slaughter.
And just as with ritual slaughter,
National Socialist Germany...
has made a clean sweep
of all Jewry.
Jewish thinking
and Jewish blood...
will never again pollute
the German nation.
Under the leadership
of Adolf Hitler,
Germany has raised the battle flag
aganist the eternal Jew.
"There's plenty of living space
in the world,
but the notion that the Jewish people
were chosen by Cod...
to live off the preductivity of other people
will finally have to go.
Jews will just have to getused to the idea
of performing some respectable,
constructive activity
as other people do,
or sooner or later they'll face trouble
they never dreamed of".
"Should the international finance Jews
inside and outside Europe...
push people into another world war,
the result will not be...
a victory of Jewry, but the descruction
of the Jewish race in Europe.
The eternal law of nature,
keeping one's race pure,
is the legacy which...
the National Socialist movement leaves
to the German nation forever.
In this spirit, the unified German people
march on into the future.
