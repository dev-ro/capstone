Deep in the 100 acre woods
a young boy named
Christopher Robin
came across some most unusual
adolescent creatures...
Cross-breeds
who some would describe as abominations.
The creatures introduced themselves
as owl, rabbit
eeyore, piglet
and most importantly,
winnie-the-pooh.
With the naivete of youth,
Christopher ignored the dangers
and befriended them all.
He brought them food,
and with each passing day together
their bond strengthened and grew.
The days turned to years
and with the years came maturity.
Eventually, Christopher had to make
the hard decision
to leave his friends to attend college
to become a doctor
requiring them to fend
for themselves once more.
Then, winter arrived.
The nights were deathly cold
the land barren
and completely devoid of food.
One fateful night,
on the brink of starvation
pooh decided that
in order to survive
the group must consume
one of their dearest friends.
And thus, eeyore was no more.
The trauma of this act warped
the minds of the group.
They became feral and developed
a hatred to all things human
and in particular, Christopher Robin
for abandoning them.
A pact was made.
They renounced their humanity
and returned to
their animalistic roots...
Swearing never to talk again.
Here we are.
Told you it wouldn't take that long.
Come on,
I know exactly where to go now.
You said that two hours ago.
Nearly there, promise.
Ok, one more hour.
- One more hour.
If not, we're turning back.
- Ok.
You know, you're the first person
I ever shown this place to.
Oh. And why am I so special?
Why are you so special?
- Hmm?
Oh, well, that is because
soon we'll be Christopher
and Mary Robin.
I don't want
any secrets between us.
And I certainly don't want you
to think I'm crazy.
I don't think you're crazy, Chris.
Ok. Come on.
Do you think
I made up those stories?
No, I don't think
you've made it all up.
Ok, so you believe me?
You believe they exist?
Well, I didn't say that.
Look... I think you were very young
and your imagination ran wild
and over the years,
you've convinced yourself of them.
They exist, Mary.
I couldn't have made all this up.
You don't need to be
ashamed of that.
Lots of people have
imaginary friends as children.
They're not imaginary, Mary.
That strong imagination of yours
is what's made you so successful.
You don't need to shy away from it.
Why are we even here? Hm?
Why are we even here
if you don't believe me?
Chris...
I don't think we're going to find them.
But I'm here to support you.
Come on, it's starting to get a bit late.
Pooh, piglet, eeyore... all of them
we were friends
for many years and...
And they're out there.
I know, you've told me
the stories many times
how you would sneak into
the kitchen to get them food
and how you would play with them
for hours and talk to them.
Yes.
This little yellow bear...
This baby pig...
That no one, Chris, not even you
has ever seen since.
Maybe you're right.
I know, I know it's quite hard
to deal with this
but that's why I came.
You know, in a way,
they still exist in you.
Pooh!
Come on, Mary, it's them! It's them!
Christopher!
- Pooh!
Christopher, it's not safe!
This is it.
This is it, Mary, we found them.
Christopher, we can't go in there.
This is the place, Mary,
but it's changed.
It can't be.
It's barely how I remember it.
This has to be some sort of mistake.
Oh... pooh.
What happened to you
after all these years?
Christopher! We need to leave, now.
Mary...
- We really shouldn't be here.
Mary, I really need to find out
what's happened here, ok?
Come on. Please?
Look, you're not in any danger, ok?
I know them. Alright?
Look, I'm here to protect you.
It's going to be ok, alright?
I really don't like this.
Mary, it's going to be ok.
Alright, I promise.
When you see them, it'll be fine.
Come on.
This is our house, Mary.
We used to...
We used to play here all the time.
It's much bigger than I remember.
Pooh?
Piglet?
Chris? Is that you?
Yes... but why is it like that?
Why would they do this?
I don't know.
But this is not safe.
We're going home.
We have to hide.
We have to hide. Hide!
Chris, hide!
Hide... hide.
- Piglet!
Piglet, stop!
Chris!
Piglet, stop, please!
Please, piglet, stop!
Please, piglet, stop!
- Stop, please!
Please, Mary! Piglet!
Mary...
Pooh...
Pooh, you need to help me, please.
There's something wrong with piglet.
He just killed my wife. Please!
Why are you doing this, pooh?
We used to be friends.
Why are you doing this, please?
Piglet, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know any of this would happen.
I thought you'd be ok without me.
Why are you doing this?
We used to be friends.
Stop.
Please. I beg you.
I would've never left, I swear.
I swear. I...
We used to play together as friends.
Remember when we were younger,
pooh, we would play...
Why, why are you doing this?
I would've never left, I swear!
I swear!
Remember when we were younger,
pooh? Please...
Stop. Stop.
Stop, pooh...
Another disappearance
in the woods today.
Mutilated body found...
Referred to
as the big foot of ashdown forest...
100 acres won't save you...
Mutilated body found...
Another disappearance in the woods...
Don't go down to the woods today...
A mutilated body
has been discovered...
Don't go down to the woods today.
New murders
at the 100 acre woods...
100 acres won't save you.
I just... I'm not really sure
how to explain it.
Well, are you happy
that you came to speak to me today?
Yeah.
And why is that?
I don't want to keep living how I am.
Everywhere I go
I'm looking over my shoulder
and I just feel on edge
you know, like, the slightest noise
and... I can just feel my heart racing.
Being aware of
how this is affecting your life
and actioning it is a big step.
With every session,
you are making good progress.
And, Maria, I am here
to help you achieve that.
It's just...
It feels like nothing
has really changed.
You are not in the same situation
you were a few months ago.
Yeah.
I know. It's just hard to adjust.
While I'm at work
in any crowds
I can't help but feel that
he could still be out there.
Have you thought about taking
a weekend away?
Go somewhere quiet
disconnect from the busy world
somewhere which might feel safer
and to take your mind off everything
that's happened.
I think it could really help you.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Two hours?
Seriously, Tina!
I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll be there, just...
Right, can you just settle in?
Get some wine,
just get the pre-drinks going.
I'll be there soon.
Honestly, you'd lose your head
if it wasn't attached to your body.
Listen. Listen.
Right, do you hear that?
Ok, that is the door.
Ok, I'm coming. I won't be long.
Yeah, alright, you flake.
Right, I'll see you soon.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Is anyone here?
I don't think there's anyone here.
Hold on. I'm comin'.
Hi.
Well, how you doin', girl?
Sorry I couldn't hear you back there.
No, it's fine.
I just wanted to ask, the pumps outside,
are they working?
Them old things? You seen 'em.
They ain't been working for years.
You're looking for gas, you can drive
up the road about two miles.
Ok.
Is there anything else
I can help you with?
- Maria, let's go! Come on!
I see you have some friends
out there.
Yeah. Sorry.
They're just a bit impatient.
Ooh! I'm so sorry!
Oh, darling, don't be silly.
My fault.
Here you go.
Oh, aren't ya sweet.
- Sorry again.
Alright. Bye!
Bye.
- Bye.
My feet hurt.
One single bug, Zoe,
you're driving me home.
It's not gonna hurt you, Lara.
I don't care. They're disgusting.
Really?
This place is kinda cool,
and did you say it has a pool?
Mm! And a barbeque.
- Nice.
Well, that pool's got my name
written all over it.
Is that so?
It's gonna be perfect.
- Yeah.
Come on, girls, let's get inside.
Wow, it's so nice.
- It is.
Oh, my god, this is so cute.
- Oh, wow.
God, it's massive.
Is that the first time
you've ever said that, Jess?
Alright, girls, do you remember
what we agreed?
Are we actually doing that?
Yeah, that's the whole point
coming here.
If you say so.
- You will.
To disconnect,
to be at one with nature.
Stop sitting around
on Instagram all day.
Lara.
- I'm not doing that, Jess.
Yeah, you are.
Come on.
You're never gonna know it's gone.
Lara...
- Fine, whatever. Fine.
She did it.
- Whatever.
She'll definitely notice it's gone,
as well.
I don't need it.
And anyway, I'm going to pack.
Dibsy best room.
Ok.
Told ya Tina weren't coming.
Fashionably late, as always.
The person you are trying to reach
is not available.
Please leave your message
after the tone.
Hi, it's me. Can you call me
as soon as you get this
cos I have no clue
where I'm going.
Is it definitely 100 acre woods,
is that the place?
Cos my sat-nav's telling me
to make a u-turn
and I'm so bad at directions.
Call me as soon as you get this
cos I have no clue where I am.
No, please!
Please! Please!
No!
Don't hurt me, please!
When did you do all this?
I had it requested before we arrived.
Don't worry, it didn't cost too much.
Do you not like it?
It's just a bit soon.
Right.
I do like it.
I know you care,
and I know you're trying a lot.

yeah you, yeah you ♪

You sure you want to?
Yeah, it's fine.
My therapist said
it'll do me some good, anyway.
Alright.
I started to notice things occasionally
seemed out of place
you know, like a garden chair
next to my window
or footprints in the garden.
What the hell? I never knew
that happened to you.
I thought, you know,
it was all just in my head
and probably nothing.
Then one night...
I'd woken up
to get something to drink
and when I came back to my room
I heard something.
Peered through the curtains
just saw these eyes
staring straight at me.
And when I screamed,
he just ran off.
That's absolutely disgusting.
I spoke to the police and there
was just nothing they could do.
Everything was fine
for about a month.
Then in public,
I started to feel this unease again
like I was being watched.
Random calls.
Then one night...
I was asleep in my room, alone.
Must've been like, 3am.
I just heard this noise in the room.
He was inside...
Trying to undress me.
That would proper freak me out.
- Lara!
The police found his computer
and found loads of me.
I had no idea.
That's why I didn't wanna tell you girls
cos it just wasn't my place.
I do feel like I'm getting out
a lot better now.
Please.
Please, just stop.
This isn't you.
This isn't who I remember.
I... I had to leave.
People wouldn't understand you,
pooh, not like I did.
Please, you have to believe me.
Imagine... imagine
what would've happened if...
I loved you, pooh.
I'm so sorry...
I missed you, pooh, silly ol' bear.
You're the best bear in all the world.
Nothing can split us up.
I'll never leave you. Never. I promise.
We'll grow old together.
Together forever.
You're the best bear in all the world.
I'll always be with you.
Pooh.
Pooh... oh, please. Don't.
No, pooh...
No!
Oh, god...
Oh, god!

What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Hello?
Hello!
Are you stalking Maria?
Whatever.
Whatever.
You're not ruining my holiday,
you fat freak.
Maria?
Maria!
Let me go! Let me go!
Please don't!
Please!
Why are you doing this?
Please, please...
Maria!
What was that?
Was that Lara?
Did she scream?
- I think so.
Oh, fuck. Come on.
Something must be wrong.
It sounded like a scream.
- Maybe Tina's here.
No, that didn't sound like Tina.
Should we go and check it out?
- Yeah, come on.
Why is this car here?
Something doesn't feel right, Maria.
Why is the door left open like that?
I'm not sure.
Come on.
Jess...
- It's ok.
What is that!
Maria, come on!
Maria, we've gotta get inside!
Maria!
Is that Lara?
Oh, we need to go!
There's Zoe and...
Lara's dead.
What?
There's someone else outside.
Whoever it is probably wrote that.
What the fuck are we
supposed to do now?
The front door was open.
They could be inside.
This was done from the outside.
We need to stick together
and find a weapon.
Come on,
we need to call the police.
Zoe, I'm scared.
I'm scared too, Alice.
I'm scared too.
What was that?
I don't know.
Did you see its face?
That did not look human.
Zoe, I'm really scared...
They're trying to get in the house.
Try to stay calm. Ok?
We need to find something
to defend ourselves with.
The kitchen! Come on, come on!
I'm scared.
We're gonna get through this.
Ok?
Why won't he leave me alone?
He just keeps following me
everywhere I go!
I'm here with you.
You're not alone. Ok?
Maria, you ok?
She's ok.
She's just had a moment.
Maria, I need you
to pull yourself together.
Whatever is out there,
it's not your stalker.
And it is trying to get
inside the house.
Come on.
Lara... she went to the pool,
didn't she, out the back?
Yeah, earlier on.
Oh, god, you don't think she's...
- Fuck.
I bet she's left the door open.
Whatever that thing is,
it's out the front.
I'm going to go close the door.
- No, you can't.
We can't let it sneak inside.
- Zoe, stop.
I've got a gun! Let's go.
I've got a gun upstairs.
A gun?
- Yeah.
I've got a gun upstairs in the room.
Come on! Come on!
Wait, I have to think where I put it.
We've got to get back to the girls!
Hurry. Come on!
Maria, come on!
- Where'd I put it?
Ok, we've got a torch.
We'll use that.
Ok, I've got it. You take that.
Ok.
- Ok.
Shh, shh.
He's inside.
Where do you think
Zoe and Alice are?
They might be hiding.
Be as quiet as possible.
We need to get to that door.
We need to shut the door
and get back to the girls.
Alice.
I love you.
I love you, too.
- Shit.
Do you think it's inside?
If I tell you to leave, you run out
that door as fast as you can.
Zoe, no, I'm coming with you.
You're not leaving me.
Get away from her!
Get away from her!
What're you doing!
Get away from her!
Get away from her, you freak!
Was that Zoe?
I think so.
Come on.
No, Zoe! No!
Zoe!
Maria...
It's Alice... look!
Shh, shh.
Oh... here. Here, quiet.
I don't think they saw us.
Are you sure
I shouldn't just shoot them?
Alice is close and you might hit her.
Let's follow them for now.
We'll find an opportunity soon, Maria.
Alice?
Alice!
Zoe?
Where's Zoe?
Zoe? Where am I?
Calm down. Calm down. It's alright.
Those creatures...
We're gonna get you out of here.
You're alright.
Hey?
They killed her.
They killed Zoe.
We can't stay here, Alice.
They could come back at any time.
Ok. Ok.
That's it. Ok.
Come on.
Keep going.
What the fuck was that?
Jessica, if there's someone else
trapped here
we can't just leave them
not to be killed by those monsters.
Maria, we need to get
the fuck out of here.
Wait. What are you doing?
They could be back any minute, ok?
We need to leave now.
Please help me.
Please, you need to help me.
Please, we don't have much time.
Please help me, please.
- Ok.
Are you gonna help! Come on.
Come on! Don't just stand there!
You ok?
Help me!
There's others. There's others?
She's the only one.
They brought her in this morning.
Go, help her! I'll be fine.
But...
- There isn't any time! Just go!
You're gonna catch up, yeah?
Oh, my god.
Poor woman.
What have they done to her?
Please...
Please help.
What happened to you?
It's pooh and piglet.
What? I don't understand.
What are "pooh and piglet"?
That's what they call themselves.
They're just these
disfigured creatures.
Half pig, half bear.
They talk some...
Broken English.
What have they done to you?
Piglet...
He just mauls me
whenever he wants.
What, you've spoken to them?
Every time I try...
Piglet just mauls me again.
I'm scared to talk.
Please, please, just get me out of here!
You're ok. Here we are.
Alright.
- Hurry.
Ah...
Ah...
What have they done to me?
- Shh!
- Please.
Please, stop! Just stop.
He's gonna hear you!
Can you please be quiet?
We need to get out of here.
Shh, shh.
Ok. Ok.
Let them come.
I'm not leaving here until he is dead.
Piglet! Where are you?
Piglet?
Where are you?
I'm here for you.
Come and find me.
She's mental.
- He's gonna come out.
He's gonna hear her.
There you are, piglet.
Why me?
This is all your fault.
You turned me into a monster.
I'm gonna make you pay...
For what you've done to me!
Her gun's not working.
Shit...
I can't listen to her screams!
Alice, come on!
Stay back!
- Oh, god!
Stay back.
Alice! Where's Alice?
- I don't know. Alice!
We have to find her!
Alice!
- Stay back!
Keep going!
- Run!
Hurry!
Hurry!
That's right.
Wake up, you piece of shit!
You're gonna pay for what you did,
you fucking freak!
You know better than anyone
how strong those chains are.
You're not going anywhere.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
I don't think he saw us.
What's he doing?
Now this is for that poor woman
that you mauled.
And this...
This is for what you did to Lara.
And this...
This is for what you did to Zoe.
Sounded like piglet.
Alice...
Alice!
Oh, no!
Maria, I just need a minute!
Listen, we don't have a minute!
Come on!
Fuck, he's coming! Come on!
Jess, come on, we need to hurry!
Wait! Wait!
Stop! Help us! Please come here!
Please, we need your help!
You need to get us out of here!
What... what you talking about?
What's happenin' to y'all, huh?
He's coming for us! He's coming!
He's killed our friends!
Who is?
- Pooh! We need to go now!
Pooh? Are you girls on drugs?
No, you're not listening to me.
We need to get out of here now!
Please!
No, girl, you need to calm down!
You ain't makin' no sense.
Oi. Logan.
Check it out.
The fuck is that?
What the?
- It's him!
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Come on!
Run!
That ain't no human, Logan.
Well, it ain't no bear, either.
Some kinda freak pickin' on
them girls, huh?
Colt, Tucker...
Tool up.
I don't like the look of this one.
Is this who's been chasing you?
No, you don't understand!
No, you can't!
- Boys, you ready?
Don't go near him!
You alright, boy?
You ain't got no manners, do ya?
The girls are terrified, Logan.
- What?
What d'you reckon

Hey, yo, what you been doin'

Ya freak!
It's your unlucky day, mate.
You think you're tough,

You're tough. I'll give ya that.

Ready, boys?
Oh, my god!
Holy fuck!

Get him off!
Shake him off!

You're Maria, right?
Ok, can you walk? Yeah?
Ok, give me your arm.
Give me your arm!
Let's go! Let's go!
Ow!
Ow! I can't!
- Come on!
No... no!
Get away!
No! No, pooh! Pooh!
Why are you doing this!
Please, please!
Why're you doing this?
Why won't you stop?
It's me you wanted! Leave her alone!
You've hurt enough people, pooh!
Please!
You're remembering
how things were. Right?
You can stop.
The good is still in there, pooh.
You can stop.
I know I caused you a lot of pain.
Just let her go, please.
I'll stay. I'll stay.
Just take me instead, please.
No, no, you can't!
He'll kill you!
You saved me. Now it's my turn.
Trust me.
Pooh...
Let her go,
and I'll stay with you forever.
Take me instead.
You left.
No!
Go!
