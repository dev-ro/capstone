THE PIRATES
WIHWA ISLAND ON THE AMROK RIVER, 1388
We must request rewards and give to our boys, sir
- Joong had a baby and...
- Listen
We'll be the vanguard
Riches and honor are soon ours.
No matter what, trust me
See? We're all set
At dawn...
We will turn back
Yes, sir!
- To overthrow Goryeo...
- What?
We'll attack General CHOE Yeong
ls the vanguard chief ready?
Yes, sir! At your service, sir!
- Isn't this treason?
- I, Yi Seong-gye...
This retreat will be the start of a great history
- With you men I'll...
- Excuse me!
- Quiet!
- It's okay
We're all in this together
Go on and speak
Why aren't we fighting when we're almost there?
You haven't heard?
We'll retreat because first...
It's hard to cross the river in the rain
Okay
Second
The rainy season will rust our arrows
Okay
Third
The supply ship may not come and we'd be stuck
Okay, sir
Fourth
It's not courteous for a small country
to attack a big one
What?
What courtesy in war, sir?
- Then, we can bow and fight!
- Quiet!
It's no place for you to talk!
It doesn't make sense!
We can't fight 'cause of rain, flood,
and bad manners?
So, being a traitor is courteous?
Go back, overthrow the king, and land big posts!
Isn't that it?
Chief MO!
You disappoint me!
Steal the country to be rich?
I'd rather be a bandit!
Sir! Let's go!
Joong! Let's go!
You fool!
Sir!
Don't you want to see your baby?
Don't make me pull out my sword
We're all brothers, sir
Joong! No!
Joong! Wake up!
The sword...
has no courtesy!
Big trouble!
Hurry!
What a waste of a life
- Kill him!
- Yes, sir!
Oh, God! I'm dying!
Damn seasickness...
I'm Captain Soma of the pirates
Where are the Buddha statues?
They're on another ship
They're under the cabin floor!
Buddha have mercy
Yeo-wol
If you let them live, they'll be trouble later
Remember
Take the statues!
Yes, sir!
- Nice!
- Buddha have mercy!
The fools even sold off girls!
Don't be scared
We'll send you home
Sis?
How dare you call the Chief Mate that!
Take me with you!
My father sold me off!
Pirates are at risk to die any day
Same for slaves!
I'll cook, clean, and do anything!
Sounds like she'll earn her keep
Buddha is sinking!
Stupid! Why'd you drop it!
You should've jumped in!
She'll come up!
- She did it!
- Hurray! Chief Mate!
THREE YEARS LATER
Black seas, red seas, white seas...
The seas are not all blue, sir
So, how was sailing around from sea to sea?
Buddha reached the state of
nirvana while travelling
After coming back here to the Yellow Sea...
I came to a realization, too
Seas or metals...
Yellow is the best!
We found some Japs pirating in our turf
You had to be there!
Stop! Aren't you sick of that story?
Then what?
We agreed to a leaders' duel
to avoid further bloodshed
So, we met up by Tsushima Island
Let's just eat!
Yeo-wol went out to face this huge, burly guy
Wait. What was his name?
Makulaki
Right! Makulaki!
But who's Yeo-wol?
She beat him with one blow!
Then, 500 men attacked at once!
5,000 men!
Was it that many?
Well, there were over 500
Anyway!
We fought off 5,000 men for two weeks 'til
the sea turned blood red!
Damn! So what?
We fight like hell, but only the Captain eats meat
All we get is diarrhea from the damn fish!
Don't talk about shit while eating
I heard Captain Soma bought 12 houses
When do we get paid?
That's enough
Like it or not, we're brothers
Why don't you attack him?
You know we all want it
Overthrow him and become the captain!
She's talking like a pirate already!
This is what I think
Who asked you?
A true pirate should...
Damn!
I told you to find another job!
What pirate gets seasick!
Damn seasickness
The order is out to get rid of pirates
If I don't bring back your heads,
they'll have mine!
Of course you should bring in results
Would 7 pirate heads do, sir?
Damn bastard!
He'll have us killed?
They're useless anyway
Wait!
Shall we go look?
- Clamp!
- Yes, sir!
- Thatch!
- Yes, sir!
- Sod!
- Yes, sir!
Crap Sack!
Here, sir!
- Big Eyes!
- Yes, sir!
Sea Horse!
Me?
Damn! I served a rotten captain like that!
And I ain't fit for the sea
Tie them up!
Captain! Let go!
Captain!
You're deserting your brothers?
The streets are filled with fools like them!
What brothers?
Chief Mate! Help! Let go!
This is not the way of a pirate!
You dare try to teach me?
Take them, sir
Captain Soma?
I want to take her, too
Still, she's the Chief Mate
How about the girl behind her instead?
Tie up the girl behind her!
Let go!
Back off! I'm a pirate!
Sis! Chief Mate! Help!
Stop this
Give the rest some liquor and meat!
Let go!
They'll forget after a couple
drinks and some laughs.
Only the strong will...
You bitch!
Captain Soma!
Drop your swords!
So ungrateful, worse than swine
I'll overthrow you
Yes!
Loser! In your dreams!
Considering our time together...
If you surrender, I'll let you live
There are only two ends for a pirate
To become fish food...
Or...
The sea is cold
Throw him a blanket
JOSEON
Joseon!
It is not only a beautiful name...
but it comes from your history
So, it shall be
Also, I am bestowing a new Royal Seal
I command the new country to flourish
Furthermore...
serve me by offering up 500 maids and 200 eunuchs
Yes, Your Gracious Majesty!
With this, Joseon will be founded!
Do you think everything is fine back home?
What if the king changes again?
Why you!
Just worried, that's all
Think about it, sir
They bestowed posts on restless, rich men
But with no country name or the Royal Seal...
They'll think nothing's changed with a new country
You can't rule a country afraid of complaints
- What's that sound?
- We're not sure, sir!
There are pirates here!
Get ready to fight!
- Prepare for battle!
- Yes, sir!
Fire your arrows!
It's a baby whale, sir
How dare it cross this envoy ship's path!
After it!
After it!
Kill it!
Fire the cannons!
Fire the cannons!
Fire the cannons!
There! There!
The baby whale is out!
Cannons! Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
The Royal Seal!
There, sir!
Joseonu.
The Royal Seal...
Crazy Tiger!
Where are you, sir!
How insane is he to be called, 'Crazy Tiger'?
Crazy Tiger!
I'm exhausted
Now I'm getting land sickness?
Still, it's better than the sea
Damn!
What's this!
Help me!
He is Chief Crazy Tiger!
So, you want to be a bandit?
Introduce yourself
My name is Chul-bong, sir
After dozens of battles and decades as a pirate...
Though I was the backbone of pirates
who ruled the seas!
I have my reasons to turn into a bandit
So, use me valuably for I'm a highly capable man
That's it, sir
Okay, fine
Why did such a capable man...
turn his back on the sea?
What?
Because I hate eating fish
I can't stand the smell
- I think I'm a meat person
- Fishy smell!
Were you kicked out?
Kicked out?
No way, sir!
Yeah, you were
No, sir! That's ridiculous!
How dare you!
Tell the truth!
Yes, sir
Okay. I'll tell the truth
I had riches and fame and lacked
nothing as a pirate
But life was just no fun!
I felt this hollow emptiness inside
I couldn't even eat
I wondered why, then realized one day!
A man should be a bandit!
That's it!
A man belongs in the mountains!
That's enough!
You look a little dumb...
but since you've got nowhere to go,
I'll take you in
As 30th in rank, do your job well
Chief! I'm the 30th?
What about all my experience?
Hey, Rookie! Go cook
Young fool! How dare you!
Why you!
What in the world happened?
My friend...
First, have a seat
You fool!
A whale ate the Royal Seal?
You dare mock me!
Behead him at once!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty...
That's what will happen
You're right
A whale ate the Royal Seal!
It makes no sense, right?
How could you let this happen?
Still, I brought back the name
for our country
What if I lost both of them?
Since you recommended me,
you'll be at fault, too
We'll just die together
I should've died at sea!
Listen carefully
Beware of public sentiment
If people find out about this strange incident...
They'll think fate is against this new kingdom
So, everything I'm about to say...
is for Joseon's good
There was no whale
You were attacked by pirates
Your Majesty!
Put me to death!
What happened to you?
Your Majesty!
While bringing the country's new name
and Royal Seal back...
I was attacked by Goryeo pirates!
They stole the Royal Seal, sir!
The Royal Seal!
Your Majesty...
And yet...
Let go!
You came back alive!
I deserve to die, sir!
But I had to bring back the country's name, sir
We defended it from the ferocious rebels, sir!
He said to call this country "Uoseon"?
Yes, sir
But the Royal Seal...
- Kill me now, sir!
- Kill us!
They must be eradicated, sir!
Goryeo bandits and pirates must be rooted out!
Quiet!
Silent!
Proclaim our new country as Joseon!
Send out troops to root out bandits and pirates!
And find the Royal Seal!
Yes, Your Majesty
As soon as...
Two weeks!
You have two weeks
Understood?
Yes, sir!
I got a great tip
A merchant band is carrying goods
with just 20 guards
When Monk gives the signal...
Buddha have mercy
Rookie!
Yes!
That's you!
Cut the rope to his signal
Then, I will...
Chief?
I fought countless battles.
I should be on the front lines,
Not back here cutting a rope!
Just do your job right
It's the Rookie's job to cut it
I said use me valuably Damn
The blessing is coming
The blessing is here
Get ready, sir!
Buddha's blessing
Make Way!
Not good!
Cut it?
Royal troops!
Cut it now?
Lots of them!
Don't cut it!
Now?
Yes!
Run away!
Son of a bitch!
Run!
What's this?
Charge! Come out! Kill them!
Goryeo rebels! After them!
After them!
We could all get killed!
Scatter out and meet back at the fort!
Scatter out!
Chief!
He's the chief!
Get him!
Wait for me, Chief!
Let's go together!
Get the chief!
Chief!
Go! Get lost!
Chief!
Don't call me, 'Chief'!
Chief! Wait up!
Let's see...
Not many made it back
At this rate, we'll bump into Yl Seong-gye!
I told you not to trust the source
I signaled you to turn back!
What were you thinking?
Why'd we take in that fool!
Better luck next time
We can't succeed every time
Succeeding once would be nice!
We never do! All we eat is dang grass!
Or catch wild boar!
It's all right
We know the royal troops
They'll pretend to chase and run home at sundown
Right, Monk?
Like hell!
Chief! Look!
Seize them!
The sun must not be down
Everyone calm down
Like hell!
Don't the fools sleep?
Chief?
Where'd he go?
Run!
Why'd I come here?
Is he still alive?
Do you want to live?
One of your men tried to harm the king?
Too bad it was before he became king
I just have to catch the whale?
Gut it and bring the Royal Seal
Then, you can have anything in Joseon
But if you fail...
It'll be hell for you
I've already been to hell, sir
You'll command the naval troops
Enjoy and rest up before
heading out early tomorrow
You said it was urgent
Can he be trusted?
I don't trust him,
but I do trust his ambition.
Are you Captain Yeo-wol?
What brings you to the rough seas, sir?
A whale!
It's over 20 meters long and has...
that flag stuck on its back
Bring it to me
I'll do the gutting
I'm not a fisherman I don't catch whales
They're angels of life and death
sent by the Sea God
The Sea God is close with us
You are free to refuse
Then, I'll follow orders to root out pirates
You think it'll be easy to arrest us?
Probably not
But I'll find your families and slaughter them
I'll burn down every village that ever helped you
I'll execute them all!
Hundreds, thousands, until I catch you
That bastard!
Why are you doing this?
Our ships are flat and strong
against the wind, but not fast
Even if we find the whale,
it'll be hard to chase it
But your ship is fast enough to hunt it down
That's the reason
I'll give you 10 days
That one-eyed fool looks like he'll eat us alive!
Attack him!
Stay out of this!
Why! I'm her right-hand-mate!
What will you do?
They're royal troops.
We should do what they ask
How'll we catch a whale?
Let's go to Central Port
That hurts!
Let's go, Monk
- People will think I starve you
- But it's meat!
What's he doing in there?
Let's go! Hurry!
That wanted picture of you looks way better
Stop talking and let's move
Damn thieves!
Don't stop.
Keep rubbing That's it
That's new! I like it!
Captain JANG?
It's been years since I became a bandit
I heard the news
You come across soldiers by chance?
By chance?
You dare sell us off?
Really! It was by chance! Don't you trust me?
I have a brilliant tip to get rich
I'll give it to you for 30 rolls of silk
My patience is running out
20 rolls!
1O rolls!
I'll give it to you for free!
A whale!
It swallowed a big ship full of the Emperor's gold
A fish swallowed it?
That's right!
The whale swallowed it whole!
A fish swallowed an entire ship?
The Royal Seal, too!
What?
Buddha have mercy!
A girl with some nerve
Dare interrupt men doing business?
What men?
All I see are two mutts...
And an old mouse
Such a shame
A beauty with a foul tongue
Who am I talking to?
Let's introduce ourselves.
I'm the infamous Crazy Tiger
I don't know about a tiger,
but you're crazy, all right
Go pick fruits to eat
Stop smiling or I'll cut your face in half!
You a bandit?
Must be hard eating off grass
Buddha have mercy We're outnumbered
This could be yours
I heard new cannons and weapons are brought
in from Europe and Arabia
Why?
You want to catch a whale?
A whale swallowed the Royal Seal sent
by the Emperor of Ming
How blasphemous!
Can you get them?
There's nothing I can't get!
I heard the new country is in total chaos
There's a rumor the king will get rid of Buddhism
Buddha is worth crap these days
You see this as Buddha?
It's just gold in my eyes
Look-
It's not the king who feeds you, but the sea
And we own the sea
Yes, Captain
I want them tomorrow
It was like 2 or 3 years ago.
We came face to face with 120 naval
ships at open sea!
The rabbit is burning
Did we run? No way!
We pirates never run away!
We fought 5,000 men for 2 weeks 'til
the sea turned blood red!
That was my 17th pirate battle
The meat is burning!
Damn it!
What!
It's not burned. See?
It's just slightly burned
Who's there?
Who else?
It's me!
You've all struggled enough after following me out
I couldn't even keep my promise
to have liquor on the table
He promised that?
So, I was thinking...
Well...
I get it, Chief
I knew this day would come
I was preparing for this, too
Preparing for what?
You want us to go our separate ways
No
We've been together way too long, you and me
Sit down and listen
Take care, Chief
Let's go
What's with you men?
Where can we apply to become pirates?
There is a ship filled with treasures
Wait! Hold On
What about it?
The Ming Emperor sent a ship filled with jewels
So what?
Must be a big ship, right?
- Of course! It's from the Emperor!
- Right
But that ship...
How can I explain this?
How frustrating!
Tell us now!
A fish swallowed the ship
The hell!
You've been a monk long enough!
Don't you know when to watch your mouth!
How dare you interrupt the Chief with such crap?
A fish swallowed the ship?
Whole?
Whole?
Yeah right!
I'm dying!
Why you!
Go on, Chief
Tell us
What happened to the ship filled with treasure?
The ship...
was swallowed by a fish
The rabbit is all burned!
Why didn't you train him!
I'm surrounded by idiots! I don't believe this!
You're dead! How can you let it burn!
Hold on!
Did they say it was a whale?
A whale?
If it wrecked a ship, it's gotta be
Right!
Yl Seong-gye is going crazy
'cause a whale ate the Royal Seal
So, you're saying we'll get rich
if we just catch the whale?
We could retire for life!
A whale, huh?
Do we catch it with a net?
No way!
Nets won't work at all.
Why?
It's gigantic!
How big can it be?
Just a fish
A fish?
This is how big it is?
Look!
A whale's eye is this big!
You liar!
I'm serious! Its eye is this big!
Then, how big are its teeth?
It doesn't have teeth It eats with its whiskers!
What's so funny?
Cut the nonsense and tell me how to catch it
There's only one way, sir
When it comes up to surface to take a breath...
you fire cannons at it!
A fish that breathes outside the water?
It's true!
It comes up, breathes out, and makes a big splash
Right out of its nose onto its back!
Water gushes up!
The nose is on its back?
Yes!
A monk has his limits!
Next, he'll say a whale even breastfeeds its baby!
That's true!
It even eats seaweed to help with breastfeeding!
I'll kill him!
I give up being a monk!
I don't believe this! How can I explain it?
You country folks don't understand
But the sea...
It's deep and wide and filled
with all sorts of things!
Some of 'em even have lights on the head!
If thousands flash light from their heads...
the sea suddenly lights up!
Light! Dark! Light! Dark!
There's also flying fish!
If thousands of 'em with wings...
jump up from the water, they flap their wings!
Swoosh!
Thousands fly right at you!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
What a sight!
Hope they're doing well
That just made me hungry
What?
Enough with the jokes
So, we can catch it with a cannon?
No way! You need at least a dozen!
Let's go get cannons!
This one!
It's a portable cannon for easy use
Bang!
And that one!
It's the king of all weapons
It's called Ju-hwa
It can strike a cone from 2,000 steps away!
That one! Yes!
It's called Fog-bomb
If you pop it, thick fog forms
and you won't be able to see
Looks like you have a good eye
It came from Europe
Thousands of miles away
It's called a Grenade Bottle
This is as dangerous as it gets
Step back
Load them up
You scared me!
Country thief asking to die?
Get out of our way!
Are you a pirate?
Must be hard catching fish
Sir!
Where is the wagon?
Crazy Tiger...
- Scatter, then meet up!
- Yes, sir!
Out of the way!
How do you work this?
- You light it! Move!
- Light?
Out of my Way!
Out of my Way!
Stop! Get them!
That Way!
Choon! Run! Faster!
Hello, Lady. I'm...
Crazy Tiger!
Throw her off!
It's heavy!
Iwin!
Look out!
Be careful!
Chief!
I'll have your head!
Calm down, my Lady!
How can I! I almost died 'cause of you!
Why you!
What?
Behind you
Fire!
Are you dead?
Ow! That stings!
Why don't we surrender and hope for the best?
Beg for our lives?
A pirate never...
What the!
Buddha have mercy
JANG Sa-jung...
So foolish
If you get hit in the head, you'll croak!
How dare you say that?
It's the truth!
Are you all ready?
Yes, sir!
Let's go! To the sea!
Fill the cannons by half to put in harpoons
Reduce the hole by two-thirds
We'll avoid the currents and sail out to sea
Raise the sail!
Though we lived as bandits...
we weren't cowardly robbers like Yl Seong-gye
He took the country by force
But he'll have to pay to
get the Royal Seal from us!
In that sea...
...is a whale that'll make us rich.
Let's go out to sea!
Let's go!
Aren't you coming?
How can we catch a whale in this!
- Let's just go!
- Stop hitting me!
Your Majesty!
Since we have declared Joseon our new country...
How about moving the capital?
No one builds a house on a grave, sir
How can the king's palace stand
on Goryeds grave?
He is right, sir
This place is lurking with Goryeo subjects
We should build a new capital
for Joseon and move, sir
It is only right to do so
But I won't go to the new capital
without the Royal Seal!
You have 5 days left
Damn! It didn't work
I thought it would buy us more time
- We just have to trust in MO
- Right
Because of rooting out Goryeo rebels...
the country reeks with blood!
And we're also catching kids to
offer as maids and eunuchs
Maybe we don't have to catch the whale to...
One of my men used to talk a lot like you
I had to pull my sword on him
Keep talking
No, sir
I'll finish loading up the ships
with water and supplies
Everything's ready, sir
We've loaded up over 300 cannons, sir
At last!
I'll get a taste of the sea!
In two days, you'll have the
fastest ship on earth, sir
We sail out tomorrow
If we wait longer, Yeo-wol will live another day
Yes, sir
Yeo-wol...
The sea did not desert me!
Chief?
Chief?
Don't drink that
Drinking sea water will kill you!
What the!
It's a whale!
Where?
That's not a whale! It's a shark!
- A great white shark!
- Catch it!
Help me!
Bullseye!
- We caught a whale!
- It's not a whale!
Yeo-wol is scouring the cost?
Yes, Captain
It's only a matter of time before we catch her
Yeo-wol!
Try running to the ends of the earth!
I have the world's fastest ship...
Did something just pass us?
It can't be...
What's that?
That's so fast!
Cannon! Hurry!
Where?
- The shell fell out!
- Wait!
Hurry!
Choon! Light it up now!
Don't move!
Hold Still!
Light it now!
It's lit!
Prepare for battle!
Load the cannons!
Reload!
Why'd you miss!
Buddha!
Fire!
Fire!
You said this was the fastest ship
Who? Me?
It's grown weak
Get ready to catch it!
The whale must've gone to heaven.
Move back!
Look!
- We caught it!
- We caught a whale!
We caught a whale!
No! It's a shark!
A whale's tail isn't like this!
Wait! It's still alive!
It's not a whale?
How many times did I tell you! It's a shark!
If a whale was a thick snake...
a shark would be just a worm!
Why you little!
Fear makes it seem bigger
At first, it seemed like a house
But now I see it's just the size of two cows
Fix up the boat to sail out again
What?
- The ship is crushed!
- How do we catch the whale now?
Aim it carefully!
Let's go catch the whale!
We're stealing that naval ship?
You can't sail a ship that big by yourself
Why steal it when you can't move it?
- I quit. Let me go
- Get lost!
No! You're steering the ship
I can't steer it alone
Get the boys to do it
Who'd listen to the last one in the band?
They always beat me up
Just let me go
Why you!
Chul-bong ranks second from now on
But Chief!
Well...
If you need me that much, Chief...
I'll try my best
Pick your men
You
And you!
Son of a bitch! Young fool always hit me!
How dare you!
Chief!
Listen to him
Listen
Swimming at sea is different from a lake
If you try to beat the waves, you'll die!
Ride 'em smoothly like a snake over rocks
That's it
Hold! Breathe out!
Just remember
You fight it, you're dead!
At sea, they used to call me 'Shark'
Listen to me at sea no matter what!
You! Snakehead!
Burn all the other ships with Chief
so they can't follow. Got it?
Make sure you cooperate
and get things done right!
I'll get the rest of the clan ready to sail out
Let's live to laugh about this!
I forgot one important thing
Buddha have mercy
There's always oil next to the torch
All the ships have 'em there
Pour the oil on the other ships
Then, come back to our ship
and shoot fiery arrows at 'em!
Got it
Listen carefully! I'm serious here!
You're all bad, but you're the worst listener!
Remember and do as I say!
We're ready to sail out, sir
Board all soldiers on the ship!
Everyone on the ship!
We're in trouble! The troops are coming!
Naval troops are coming!
What now, Sub-Chief?
I don't believe this!
Chief has to come for us to go! Where is he?
Commander!
There! Look!
We're under attack!
Chief is coming!
Get ready to sail!
Hurry!
Monk! Drop the sails!
You! Cut the rope!
Hurry!
Cut it?
Who's there!
Hurry!
Don't come up! Go back!
Chief!
Get on! Hurry!
Move!
JANG Sa-jung!
MO Heung-gap!
I never thought this day would come!
Chief! Hurry!
You're still alive?
You left your post for this?
I'll send you to hell!
Shut up!
So, did you go out and change the world?
I have no interest in that!
Chief!
Get on now!
Hurry!
Chief!
Grab the rope!
Pull! Pull!
Damn!
I'll be back for your head!
How many ships left?
A few small ones, sir
Send them all out to catch the whale!
The whale isn't the problem!
With all the naval ships wrecked like that...
How can we expect to live?
Listen carefully
We'll say pirates who stole
the Royal Seal attacked us, too
Though we lost our ships,
we fought off the pirates
And recovered the Royal Seal. Understood?
We may find the Seal, but what pirates, sir?
We'll make them up
This is a pirate village!
Treat them like pirates and kill them all!
Mommy!
Flats with seaweed in between.
The whale must be roaming here
Whale!
The one with the flag stuck on it!
The flag is really on there!
- Get the harpoons!
- Yes, sir!
We're ready!
Captain? The order?
Why are you hesitating?
It's a baby whale
How old does it look?
Huh?
I must be going blind
Can't you see? It's a newborn!
Everyone's tired
We can't exchange a whale's life
for people's lives
Captain!
Should I give the order?
No
Aim at it
Ready to fire!
Who are those bastards!
What's on your mind?
Out in this vast ocean...
a man can stretch without limits
Looks like the sea suits us
The ship's big, so no one's seasick
Hey!
Raise the sail!
What's that?
What you're holding! Stupid!
- If he's a pirate, I'm Buddha!
- No! Tie it there!
Let's learn quickly and kill him!
How can he be second in rank?
- Buddha have mercy
- What's the racket?
Chief! Wait!
Just a second
I don't get it
There are many whales in this vast sea
How will you catch the one who ate the Royal Seal?
We'll keep catching whales until
we get the right one
Yeah! You said it's huge!
- How many can there be?
- Just one!
Stupid ignorant bandits!
Whales aren't minnows!
Can't catch and gut 'em!
What a beauty!
You finally got to see it That's a whale!
Its nose is one its back!
I told you it was there!
Must be a female It's kind of small
That's small?
There are bigger ones?
Of course! His thingy is this thick!
What thingy?
Whiskers
They're this thick
Aren't you going to catch it?
Catch that?
You said it's a fish
Just a fish
Catch it to eat for dinner
Gut it and cut its fins...
You fool!
What's wrong?
If it was that big, you should've stopped us!
Why bring us out to sea!
Damn it!
I said it was huge a thousand times!
Rank him 10th!
The last of us!
You big-mouthed fool!
Should've drawn the whale's eye bigger!
I said if you let 'em live, they'd be trouble!
You became a mere fisherman?
Putting harpoons on cannons?
How is it?
The smell of the sea before you die?
The sea smells the same
Get him! You even beat 5,000 men!
5,000 is an exaggeration
Let's fight to the death!
We've lived long enough!
- You're going blind anyway
- What?
Don't be foolish!
There's no way to stop a cannon
Soma!
This is between you and me!
I challenge you to a duel!
Naive girl!
That's why you're not fit to be a captain!
Boys!
Bring the ship up close
Captain?
There's a ship
It's a naval ship!
A man should eat meat!
- Who needs fish?
- Right!
We're fit for the mountains
- Forget the damn fishy-smelling pirates!
- Right!
Men are like mountains! Women are like the sea!
Buddha likes mountains, too
How stupid for pirates to float on
a ship instead of the vast land?
That's why they're the dumbest of all thieves!
Right!
Let's go back!
Buddha! Here we come!
MY Lady! It's me!
Damn Crazy Tiger!
It's me!
That ship is blocking the cannons.
Chief?
We're in a weird spot here
Now!
Attack!
Fight!
Against who?
Get them!
Attack!
I came to help you!
My Lady! Help!
Who are you?
I'm Crazy...
Damn it!
This isn't our fight! Let's go!
Let them fight it out!
Don't fight! Please!
Just cut his arm!
Killing is bad
Wait!
Chief!
We're drifting apart!
Chief!
You've lasted long enough
Captain Soma won!
Congratulations, sir!
Who are you?
I'm Crazy Tiger, JANG Sa-jung
JANG Sa-jung?
That's right
It's not easy to meet like this
How about becoming brothers for life?
Yes, sir!
Sir?
They'll be sent to the naval troops and executed!
That's what you pay for challenging me!
You abandoned your brothers and got tossed out...
And haven't changed one bit
After everything I taught you,
you're still hung up on brotherhood?
Naive fools fall victim to those with power
So true, sir!
As you can see, we're just passing travelers
We just came the wrong way
Don't you know it's rude for a bandit to attack a pirate?
If you say so...
Spare us, sir
You're cute, the way you beg
Beg like him, bitch!
Did you forget?
There are only two ends for a pirate
To become fish food...
Or be resurrected as a dragon!
There are two ways for bandits, too!
Go after money
Or...
Stay alive all of you!
Wait! I'm not ready!
Chief! Captain!
Soma at your service, sir
Explain what happened to Yeo-wol
I heard she changed cannons with harpoons
She was chasing whales like a fisherman, Commander
Right before she caught it,
I turned her into whale bait
I'll offer you tributes-twice as much as before
How much is your life worth?
Since I rule the seas...
The price of a whale
If you catch it, you'll live If you don't, you'll die
A whale, sir?
I'm taking over this ship
You catch the whale and I'll gut it. Got it?
You're free to board my ship, Commander
But please remember this-
What?
The one who gives orders here...
can only be me, Soma
Commander
Damn...
Who are you?
A pirate or a bandit?
Why's that important at a time like this?
Who cares!
Fool!
Pirates are way above petty bandit thieves
What a load of crap!
Didn't your leader lose the swordfight?
At least she didn't grovel for her life like yours did!
He did not!
He's a great thief who once fought
with Yl Seong-gye!
Right!
Yl Seong-gye...
Who's that?
Ignorant pirates!
That's the king's name
Pirates don't serve kings!
Only Captain Yeo-wol, daughter of the dragon!
A dragon's daughter?
The eldest at that!
Our chief is a tiger's father!
- The eldest one!
- Right!
Damn!
Come here!
Don't mix with petty bandits!
Come here!
Don't mix with loser pirates!
Why am I so important all of a sudden?
I don't care!
Mountains are for men!
The sea is for men!
So, why's your leader a girl?
A girl?
- You grass-eating fool!
- You anchovy crap!
Cut it out!
Why, you!
Hey!
You're not sleeping, are you?
My Lady...
Shall we go pee?
Stop being so disgusting
How is peeing disgusting?
It's only natural
I gotta go real bad!
Cutting off your wrist will solve this
Your Majesty!
Goryeo revered Buddhism
Monks conspired with aristocrats to rule locally
Revere Confucianism, oppress Buddhism...
and redirect the riches into the palace, sir
Thus, establish a firm basis to your kingdom, sir!
But I have no Royal Seal to stamp such a decree!
I'm afraid to say this, but...
If you're afraid, don't speak!
Two days!
Just two days left
Why do they bring up things instead of
finding the Royal Seal?
Whales stay on the same migratory routes
Two days are enough to catch it
I heard it's really big
Won't it be hard?
We'll attack the baby whale, sir
The mother whale never leaves the baby. It'll be easy
What will you do with her?
Whales are angels sent by the Sea God
Catching one would anger the Sea God
Too bad for you, but she'll be sacrificed
If you came to me then, you wouldn't be here
I should've killed you then
Daring bitch
What's that?
My mom gave it to me
She said it was all she had
Where is she?
She died
Soldiers killed her
Why?
'Cause my father was a pirate
But morn was a fish diver
So, I can't stand soldiers like you
It's been years since I became a bandit
Did you commit a crime?
I did
I failed to protect my brothers and country
Do we have a country to protect?
Kings and aristocrats run off first
when enemies attack
They offer children as maids and eunuchs
They choke the people for more taxes
Rather than defending a country like that...
I'd give my life to protect someone I love
I agree with you
That's why I want to catch the whale
I can't live in hiding forever
I want a happy life with a family
Are you married?
I'm a bachelor!
See? We have unbreakable ties like this
You're really asking for it!
I'm not joking, my Lady
Won't you be that special person in my life?
Your face turned red
It's from the fire!
Let's go for a swim
Is it urgent?
Let's go
Wonder why the sea is warm
A petty thief dares mock a pirate captain?
A petty thief?
There are 20 silver coins on my head
There are 50 on mine! Twice as many
The reward money isn't important!
Look!
It's from killing a powerful Yuan general!
This is from killing a Vietnamese pirate head!
I killed 500 Ming soldiers by myself!
I fought off 5,000 pirates by Tsusima Island!
I even survived an attack from a tiger! See?
Ever heard of a dragon?
What do you know about dragons!
A dragon bit me, but...
Shocked?
Look!
Why am I all alone...
I thought I was a goner!
What happened to the rest?
Goryeo rebels BANG, YEO, KWAK...
And the rest of you!
So damn unlucky!
After the mountains and the seas...
I end up dying like this?
"When we should unite...
and work hard..."
Why's this so long?
"To create new history in this land..."
Chief?
Who's that?
Who are you?
Who's asking?
"Who's asking?"
What's it to you?
"What's it to you?"
Quiet
Why!
IIWhy?"
So what?
"So What?"
- Quiet!
- No!
I just said my legs hurt! What's wrong with that!
I'm sitting on a big bump! It kills!
Just kill me! I gotta pee!
I apologize on his behalf
Don't! Can't I say it hurts?
- Quiet!
- You be quiet!
Chief
What? Thief?
Chief
They've lost their minds!
Soldiers!
- Kill the rebels at once!
- Yes, sir!
Over here! Captain!
Chief!
Over here!
Chief!
Captain!
What about me?
Stay back!
Soldiers!
Where is the girl?
So, you became a bandit?
I don't know what to say...
I ran off without a word
You'll always be our brother
No matter where you go, be a good thief
You'll attack Soma with just them?
Leave the sea to us and go back to the mountains
Please reconsider
Come to the mountains with me
Let's be happy there
You're really testing my manners
Here's my final offer
If you beg me to stay, I'll stay
If you beg to come along, I'll take you in
If you mock a pirate, this is what happens!
We'll attack Soma!
And rescue our sister!
Look
The color of the sea tells us where the whale is
The clouds are low We should turn back!
I said whales are angels sent by the Sea God
Thought they're easy to catch?
Yes, sir!
Come up to the surface
There!
It's the whale!
Full speed portside!
Mommy!
It was the naval troops!
They framed the village as the pirates' hideout
They killed all the men and took the children
MO's troops did this?
There's no end to that bastard's greed
I must kill that devil myself!
Where?
Back to the sea!
Not again!
Though I can't save the world...
A man should protect the one he loves
Then Why'd I get off the ship?
I come over here and now I'm going back? Damn!
Chul-bong! You're second in rank
Let's go, Chief!
Hurry! Chief!
Chief! What about me?
- Stop the ship!
- Go after it!
- No! Stop!
- After it!
Commander!
The whale is getting away!
Only I give the orders on this ship!
A baby whale can't hold its breath for long
It'll come up soon
- Stop the ship and wait!
- Yes, sir!
There! It's a whale!
Turn starboard!
- Go right!
- Go right!
Get the baby, not the mother!
- Aim at the baby!
- Yes, sir!
Come closer!
More
Fire!
Fire!
- Pull the rope!
- Yes, sir!
Lure the mother whale!
Fire!
Stop!
Listen carefully!
If we don't kill it in one blow, it'll get us!
- So be on alert!
- Yes, sir!
Think you can destroy my ship?
Come closer!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Now! Throw the grenades!
The Sea God!
A great storm is coming, sir.
Whales truly are angels from the Sea God
- Throw the girl in as a sacrifice!
- Yes, sir!
- Throw the harpoons!
- Yes, sir!
Let's pull the whale back to land!
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!
Commander!
I give the orders here!
You'll take all the credit, huh?
You're smarter than I thought
Oh, much smarter
- Show 'em!
- Yes, sir!
If we light the wick linked
to the explosives' den...
We'll all blow up and become fish food
Don't forget
We share the same fate on the same ship
I'm not going down with you!
Go ahead and try!
You don't have the nerve!
Think you're man enough?
The dragon is resurrected!
Sis...
Let's go home
Are you okay?
Guard the whale! Don't lose it!
No!
This bitch's life is mine
A soldier can't kill a pirate like her!
Fire!
Fire!
Sis!
There are only two ways for a bandit!
Go after money!
Or go after love!
We'll talk about that later
You bastards!
One of us won't be setting foot on land today
That won't be me!
Thanks, Bandit!
Pirate! You owe me!
Captain Yeo-wol!
Shit!
Yeo-wol!
- Oh no!
- Chief!
It's all over!
I shouldn't have taken you in, then...
Run for your life
The ship is about to explode
It's the last favor I give you
Hurry!
Hurry!
Run! The ship will explode!
Hurry!
Get off!
Go to hell and apologize to Joong!
Jump!
Commander!
I said same ship, same fate!
I'm JANG Sa-jung
Do you remember me?
What country do I belong to?
Since Ming gave the name Joseon,
am I a citizen of Ming?
I don't want to belong to such a country
A whale swallowing the Royal Seal
is heaven's warning...
Against ruling under Ming's influence
Even a whale risks its life to save its baby!
How can a king sacrifice his people
to find a Ming seal?
Think about what kind of world you'll make
If you create a country truly for the people...
I, too, will uphold you as king
A whale ate the Royal Seal?
Forgive us, Your Majesty!
You fools!
Send home all the children set
to be offered to Ming!
Your Majesty!
But Ming demands them!
Quiet!
HAN! Go to Ming at once!
Sir?
Go and renegotiate!
If you fail...
I'll send your children off as maids and eunuchs!
Understood!
Yes, Your Majesty!
I should've died at sea!
YI SEONG-GYE FOUNDED JOSEON
IN 1392
THE ROYAL SEAL WAS RECEIVED
FROM MING IN 1403
FOR 10 YEARS
AFTER JOSEON'S FOUNDING...
A TEMPORARY SEAL CALLED
'JOSEON'S ROYAL SEAL' WAS USED
Hey!
- Don't tie that there!
- You said to!
- That's not what I said!
- No!
The Wind's blowing this way!
- Stop confusing us!
- You do it!
When will they get it right?
I should've killed him back in the mountains
You said it, Monk!
I gotta get off this ship
