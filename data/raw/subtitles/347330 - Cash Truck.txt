I was shocked when John Lennon died...
and also when Harrison died...
And if McCartney were to die...
I'd be very sad.
- What about Ringo?
- Ringo Starr, no...
It would be less...
There's only one Stones song
that I don't like too much...
it's Angie...
goes something like this...
It even reminds me of
The Beatles a bit, but...
I like it...
Yeah, well...
Sure, it goes well with...
Is that all you guys know?
- Do you know Dolly Parton?
- Who's Dolly Parton?
Well, Dolly Parton is a
great country singer.
But that's old music!
And the music you like is new?
That's cowboy music...
What I like about Mick Jagger
is that he proves...
that you can get old and
still rock and roll...
You're right, he's our age.
And did you know I met him?
One day he was thirsty and went
to your house for a drink.
No, I went to his house...
in 1992 I was working at Securimax.
I took a suitcase to
his castle, in Touraine.
Does he live in Touraine?
Don't you think that France
is a beautiful country?
It's beautiful and big!
What an idiot... Take this...
and take this!
Write down his number, just in case...
Central, this is truck number eight.
THE MONEY TRUCK
Yes?
Alexandre Demarre...
They told me to come today.
Stop it with that, Dolph.
Shake it, shake it quickly...
that's what you have to do.
Have you ever gone through
a traumatizing experience?
No.
Are you married? Do you have children?
No.
I like that...
any psychiatric records?
No. I already answered those questions.
Each unit at the company
keeps its own records.
Let's see... no criminal background.
Perfect. Are you unemployed?
Yes.
You'll get a month's
contract to start off.
I'm sorry, but the
company was bought...
by the market leader...
so we're only hiring until
the end of the year.
But if you do your job well, nothing can
prevent you from a steady contract.
Don't tell the others,
but the last ones hired...
will not necessarily be the
first to get laid off.
With this situation, morale is
low among the employees.
Go to the dressing room, one of your
work mates will take care of you.
Hurry up, you're late!
And if you have any problems,
you can come to me.
That's what I'm here for.
There won't be any problems, sir.
Don't bust my balls.
- It's over now...
- Yes, it's over... over for us.
Because it's not 1, it's not 2,
it's not 3, we'll be left without...
- Is it African?
- Nah, Detroit, a remix...
- My name's Bernard...
- My name's Belette.
- I'm Alex.
- Let's see...
I'll give it back to his wife.
Sign here!
What's that?
A petition for training.
What training?
Do you think you can
start without training?
They make me laugh with the
six shooting sessions per year.
Policemen train six hour per week...
for at least a year.
Continuous training my ass!
Thanks. Welcome to Vigilante.
Jacques, come see. I have
something to show you.
- Who are you?
- Excuse me, I'm new.
Let's go. We're very busy.
I didn't know there
were women here.
Just one!
Thank you.
Here, 92R 67. Remember the number.
It's your gun. Respect it.
Nicole, you're late again.
You got truck 3.
Three?
- Three?
- Yes.
- It's heavy.
- I know, eight kilos.
You can't wear it for driving,
but when...
the Americans take over, we'll
get nice new light ones.
- What are you doing?
- He's with me.
Hi, I'm Jacques,
I take care of newbies.
He's the Mummy.
It's not hard.
We load up, cruise, and then offload.
Go in front, take my place.
Don't play with that.
- Wake me up at the first stop!
- You can sleep a little.
- Where did you use to work?
- At a bank.
You do well to change jobs, there's
nothing worse than security guard.
You just stand there
waiting to get killed.
At least we can talk.
You'll like it.
- Do you have a C license?
- No.
Your salary is 1200 euros,
the driver gets 1350.
- And what does he do?
- Messenger.
He makes almost 1500. He earns more,
but it's more dangerous.
Have you been working
long for Vigilante?
Seven years... seven years, damn!
Who are the customers?
Dangerous neighborhoods,
small retailers.
We rarely carry big loads.
Bur I prefer it that way. The smaller
the load, the smaller the risk.
Go back to the truck.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Put the gun away,
you could get a warning.
Come on, give us the cash...
- You're an asshole!
- Mother fucker!
- Prick, give us the dough!
- Fucker!
- Shit face!
- Give us the money, shit face!
- Fucker!
- Mother fucker!
Fuck off!
You're not a man!
Let's go!
- He's gay.
- He'll fuck the other one.
He's a shit-faced faggot.
It's OK, let them have some fun.
Let's go!
Truck number 3, what's the
code for this week?
- Indigo.
- Right, Indigo.
- Are you married?
- No.
It's better that way,
she wouldn't stand it.
- Want some?
- What is it?
- They're like chocolates.
- No, thanks.
A Halouf special!
- Tell me, have you been robbed already?
- No.
And Vigilante?
Yeah, three times this year.
There's 200 hubs in France...
over 6000 security agents...
and it had to happen to us!
Do you think it's just coincidence?
Hand me the newspaper.
I haven't read my horoscope.
Our best trucks are not yet
up to the new standards.
Ours are not well armored.
When is that going to change?
Not before the Americans take over.
They're not even replacing
the ones that break down!
We transport millions and
the company is crap!
What's your Zodiac sign?
Shut up, Dolph.
So, what do you think of the job?
Not bad.
Are you going to work
for the Americans?
Why do you ask?
Dolph, the newbie wants to bet.
They sent someone last year,
before they bought Thèmox.
They believed there were moles...
so they wanted to clean up,
it's normal.
They should have investigated
the management...
every time they've had
complicity problems...
the problem was upstairs.
20 euros.
- It's all I have left.
- I'll pay it back.
- And mine?
- And what?
- Mine.
I'll think about it.
Sign, even the newbies have to sign.
Stop busting our balls
with that petition.
Where are you going?
Need a ride?
No, I'll walk a bit to relax.
- You sure?
- Yeah. Bye.
Bye.
Arlette is free, if you want.
- Don't start with that, Jacques!
- It was you who asked me.
- Nice guy, eh?
- Yeah.
You saw it, he signed!
- How long will you be staying?
- A month.
Here.
- Have you seen Isabelle?
- No.
Damn!
That'll be 1450 euros.
Room 652, north side.
Please... I don't want anyone
entering my room, ever.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Isabelle.
How do you know my name?
MICHEL POITRENAUD,
NICK MOMIA.
JACQUES MAZARD,
NICK JACKPOT.
RÈMY BLOSSIER,
NICK BUTAGAZ.
PIERRE LUKOWSKI,
DRIVER...
Thank you.
Fiat? 1962/1500?
Know it? It'll be a beauty.
Stop bugging us with
that old lemon.
Do something useful.
I'm talking to you.
Damn! Is that the load?
Why don't we ever see the money?
- To avoid temptation.
- They think of everything.
You'll see how it is. Let's go.
Electricity is the worst...
they connect a high voltage
wire to the truck...
you get 20000 volts up your ass.
Not everyone can buy a flamethrower.
I can get you one for 12000 francs...
a grenade for 100 euros...
made in France.
Nowadays every punk in
the bad neighborhoods...
wants to rob a cash truck.
They're even using pit-bulls.
Belette, what are you doing?
We'll be late.
OK, it's loaded.
I'll show you a trick.
Give me.
Yours. Have a hit.
Good, isn't it?
We have to go.
Where were you? I've been
waiting for 20 minutes.
Are you new?
Where did they find you?
Fuck! I only have coins...
Let's move on, I have
other things to do.
Next time, I'll file a report.
You could at least say goodbye!
Don't close the door.
Come, this way...
I'll show you something nice...
look everyone in the eye...
see how they get paranoid.
Let's fucking go!
Can he come out of the truck?
After fifteen years, he can
fuck with the rules.
No! No!
Check out the reflexes!
Son and grandson of a cop.
Why aren't you a cop?
- I didn't pass the test.
- Shame.
But I have my contacts.
The best suppliers in Paris!
Come on, get in the truck!
What's my name?
Bernard.
Get in!
- Is that all?
- They didn't pay it all.
Let's go.
A real crisis! Can't even sell dope.
Hell, I said just one
bullet for each one.
Your turn, Butagaz.
- You're fucking crazy...
- Shut up.
Very good, Nicole.
William Tell...
- You could take this seriously.
- I don't like it.
I'll donate my bullet to the newbie.
Come, your turn.
Don't worry.
Start low...
and stretch out your arm.
Right on the leg...
she won't get away.
We were in the parking lot...
and I thought she'd
kill my piece.
A piece like this.
- Your change.
- Thanks.
- See you.
- See you.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
Which are the dangerous spots?
There are rounds that are
more dangerous, right?
Are you here for the adrenaline?
A bit, yes.
Since I started working here,
I've never pulled out my gun.
You were lucky, we've had
three attacks this year.
Do you think they're the same people?
They've already killed nine
agents and two civilians.
They don't leave witnesses.
If the bastards close me in,
I'll get them.
Anyway, we're all going to
die one way or another, right?
No.
See you.
- Any news from management?
- Nothing.
You're not at risk.
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.
- Did you ride with Bernard today?
- Yes.
The old generation.
The NCO's on their last tour.
Don't mind him, he's sick.
Tell me, are small
loads less of a risk?
They're small now, but in
a month it'll be Christmas.
It'll be hot then.
Anybody there?
It's pretty slow, we're in
the middle of a recession...
they'll decide, at last,
to lower the lending rates.
Immediately there'll
be short-term fluctuations...
in the stock exchange...
that's my specialty, understand?
There's a storm at the office.
I asked for a few days off...
to be with you, but it's not possible.
It's the situation...
there's a small event...
within the economic environment,
and you have to react quickly.
You always admired my work...
even without understanding it.
When I used to say that you had won,
or that I had won...
were you proud of me?
It's the same thing now,
you'll be proud of me...
you just have to rest.
I won't be long, just a
call and I'll be back.
I can come early in the
morning or late in the evening.
Isabelle?
I've just finished, darling.
INCREDIBLE ROBBERY
ANOTHER ARMORED TRUCK ROBBERY
- Hello.
- Hello.
Sir, in three weeks you haven't
had any guests...
and I can't clean up...
Are you hiding?
No.
- Are you a cop?
- No.
- Will you be around for the holidays?
- Yes.
Could you lend me some money?
I'll pay it back when I get paid.
How much do you need?
50 euros. It's for my son's gift.
I have to buy it now,
there won't be any left later.
- I just have this.
- Thank you.
See you later.
Damn!
This collar isn't new.
- It's still got bullet marks.
- Stop talking bullshit!
- Sign here.
- What is it?
A petition from the union
for a year's end bonus.
No, I don't want complications.
Don't come crying later.
Stop busting our balls
with your petition!
You test my patience.
Can you take a pic?
What a riot.
Another one, please.
Thanks.
It's all ruined.
- What's your name?
- Leave me alone.
- General Belledent Square...
- Aren't you wearing a vest?
So I get my head blown off?
You're going with Nicole and Alex.
Make a group of four
for the supermarket.
- I'll take care of the newbies.
- Cut it out.
In ten days the Americans
will bring their instructors...
might as well get used to it.
I don't want newbies at a Dakar!
- What's a Dakar?
- A dangerous route.
I would be violent to a virgin.
Are you Nicole?
I'm Karim.
You'll see!
10 minutes early...
it doesn't matter.
Come on, I haven't got all day.
Stop taking Prozac, idiot.
Saying Merry Christmas
is not a big effort...
The door!
Cunts!
Is it true the company will be sold?
- Yeah.
- So what do you think?
Nothing.
Thanks.
Alexandre!
Hey, newb, that place is taken!
Nicole, what are you doing tonight?
Want some?
- What's the effect?
- Relaxing...
Take two...
it's great.
- Do you know that guy?
- I don't know.
- How did you wind up here?
- Depression.
Poor you...
Aren't you fed up with this job?
You know, they will fire me...
so I couldn't give a fuck.
It's a nice load, ain't it?
It would be a nice goodbye.
Don't tell me you never thought
about it. We're all the same.
It's just a bag. That makes
me feel less stupid.
I wouldn't even know
what to do with it.
With all these robberies,
do you think...
it's an inside job?
Four of five years ago I would
have said no, but now...
they even hire Arabs.
Nicole, just between you and I...
is it true that you're a dyke?
The bonuses!
75 euros each!
- Thanks.
- Give me two.
Who's first?
Thanks...
Will we earn more with the Americans?
We're negotiating.
- Will you go on with your politics?
- I want to!
Give me the keys to the locker,
I think I forgot to remove...
the bullets from my gun.
Someone could get hurt.
Who's that for?
Come Marilyn, come, please.
Come, please... come.
Make the best of it. I won't
be here next year.
- Will you be in prison?
- Might be.
I'm going to sell cocaine.
I have a good plan.
Great!
Have you seen Alex?
- And do you have something lined up?
- Yes.
Hang on, I'm calculating...
wait... wait...
The cell phone is new, I don't
know how it works...
yeah, like this... wait...
Listen, I can't say.
3.8, 3.9, depends.
I don't know... with the
European tax, it will be...
well, yes, they're right:
15. 15 or 16...
I don't know! I honestly don't know...
I would have to...
hang on...
I can calculate that...
Sorry, I've just been
attacked by a tiger...
Yes, a forest tiger.
Have you peed already, tiger?
I don't mean you,
I'll call you later, bye.
First one to buckle up...
Attention 1, 2, 3, now.
You like to pounce on me
when I'm on the phone.
You can't attack me like that.
I'm going to call your mother
to tell her we're on our way.
What's this?
What's he doing? Come on,
get out of the way...
What's he doing?
Buckle your belt, buckle your belt...
Go, dad!
No, stay still...
Your envelope, you earned it.
And who are you?
Ask me to dance?
I was getting worried.
Why?
You've been here for a month...
and today was the first time
we worked together.
What are you doing here?
Same as you, earning a living.
You have delicate hands.
What are you doing here?
Are you a journalist... writer?
I requested that no
one enter my room.
OK, I got it.
What's that scar?
Please.
See you later, sir.
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
Speak to Kelem!
Speak, then!
Speak, then!
Stop that.
Show some respect for the dead...
damn it!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you!
Stop.
- What's going on?
- He called him a snitch.
- Who?
- The old man.
If he killed himself, it's because
he felt guilty about something.
- You're a bastard.
- Calm down...
Whoever wants to fight,
come to the hall with me...
Fights should be in a ring.
Give me your hands.
All right...
This week's password is "Carmim".
You're getting on my nerves
with your fucking passwords.
- Calm down a bit.
- I'm not an idiot.
Alex! Come see. We're going
to do some wrecking.
Watch out... Calm down.
I missed the two targets.
So they can go jerk off at home.
Alex, did I tell you what
happened to my leg?
- Three times...
- This will be the fourth.
It was in Sudan, with
my friend Gerbier...
- Don't move.
- Get out!
Get out... don't be idiots,
it's not your money.
You! Get out!
Damn, I can't believe...
- Don't shoot, we'll come out.
- Shut up!
Out! Out!
I'll show'em...
Charles Martel!
This is truck 5,
we're being attacked...
Don't be an idiot, let's
avenge our colleagues.
Let's go.
What are you doing? Fuck!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come back here, motherfuckers.
You're not at fault at all.
On the contrary, it was
legitimate defense.
I didn't mean to do it.
And you scared them off.
I killed a kid.
That kid, no doubt, took part
in other robberies...
in which nine... ten men
were killed, including today.
How can you know?
All the men that quit...
after events like today's later
became depressed.
And if you stay, you'll be
a professional hero.
I'll talk with the new management.
Your job is guaranteed.
Can I leave now?
It would be a shame to
lose you. Stay on.
Tell Bernard to come in.
He almost won the Paris
kickboxing title.
And the Americans wanted him.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
Thanks for calling.
The union has decided to go on strike.
What for? The company's
closing down in a week.
The Americans won't give a fuck.
- It has to be this way.
- I can't stand any more burials!
- What's wrong with you?
- Who will be next?
- Stop that, Nicole.
- You're all the same.
Those bastards left me on foot.
And between work and dismissal,
do you think I'll choose work?
And you're all gonna
testify for me!
Remi?
Nicole?
Francis?
You were there! You can say it
wasn't my fault!
Everybody knows it was
your fault he died.
Bastard.
Stop that!
Leave that...
- Is that the way it is?
- Yes, it is.
All right...
I think he's nervous...
- He knows it's coming!
- What did they tell you?
The usual bullshit.
It's normal to be nervous.
I'm quitting.
Are you also leaving us?
Yeah.
Motherfuckers!
It's a charter flight to Bangkok.
They're leaving tomorrow.
I'm sorry, it's your last night...
- Where's Isabelle?
- Isn't she in the hall?
If I find her, I'll kill her!
Delphine, Delphine!
Let's go.
Thank you.
They're looking for you downstairs.
So? Let them look.
Let's go.
Miss.
Give it to me.
What is it?
I'd tell you Santa Claus,
if you believed in him.
No.
How did you get my number?
- Sign here!
- What is it?
- Petition for training.
- What training?
Do you think it's normal to start
working without training?
Don't bother me, I'm not interested.
Don't come complaining later.
The newbie didn't give you
the time of day.
You can laugh, but they'll
give us the bonus!
You'd do anything for a tip!
What's going on?
- It's a bitch...
- It's OK...
They should have fired you.
- Don't provoke me!
- Hi.
It's good you came back!
See, boy, this job sucks.
- The company's closing...
- Hey, mate.
And perhaps next week
we'll all be unemployed.
It's Christmas eve and
we'll have to work...
Well, he came back, and that's good.
I think you'll keep your job with 
the new company...
we can work together.
But this is just between you and I.
Have you seen my console?
Talking to me?
He's crazy.
- 92 B13, keep the number.
- Yeah...
- 92R.67
- Here.
I wouldn't like to give it
to anyone else.
Tonight, we'll celebrate
Christmas eve together.
You must have a long story,
after all that happened.
Me too.
Bye, bye.
Good day.
Bye.
I need to talk to you.
Cut it out, I don't have
your game console.
It's a long trip. It's going
to take me hours.
Bye, see you tonight.
What a job. Nice, right?
I'll take you out for a spin later.
Alex, come, come with us...
Please.
Wait, we'll change...
take my place.
Yes, that's right,
I spoke to the boss.
- What the fuck?
- it's all right, we'll trade places.
I wasn't going to leave
you with that idiot.
Shit!
Won't it bother you to have
to work for the Americans?
- What about you?
- Yes, it will.
I got everything...
Lotto, Super Bingo...
Here, let's do it,
let's scratch them.
Nothing...
nothing...
Why did you come back?
To work.
Nothing for me?
You won!
We'll split it.
OK.
Where are we going?
We're going...
to see some friends.
Looks like you used to
have money before.
Don't you need it?
Yes.
- We're wasting time.
- There's no hurry.
We're a bit late.
Where are you?
- That was Nicole.
- What did she want?
To kiss you. You'll be the first.
Let's go!
Your music is dull, Karim.
Don't bust my balls.
I don't have to listen to that shit.
No need to get angry,
life is beautiful.
Did you follow me?
Yes, I was intrigued.
So, what do you say?
I think you're here to start over.
Go on...
And since I like you, I'll help you.
- How?
- By introducing you to some friends.
All right.
Thanks.
When?
Now.
What are you doing?
At first, I thought you were
working for the Americans.
- What are you doing, Jacques?
- And then I understood it was him.
So what do you think?
All this money, all these days...
it's tempting.
I tried to resist, I swear.
And one day I found them.
I couldn't help it...
So, now it's simple...
you're either rich...
or an idiot.
Truck number 3... password, "Carmin".
You're lucky, if the
"Mummy" hadn't died...
he'd be in your place.
They're late.
The boss promised to hire me back...
Well, tonight I feel rather un-hired.
Tonight...I'm taking it out!
And you?
I'll be with my wife,
you can come by.
Depends... is she a good cook?
Bernard is our best shooter...
he's kind of stupid, but useful.
If you stay with me in the truck,
nothing will happen to you.
Just let them do it...
we have 12 minutes.
Merry Christmas, Alex.
Shut your eyes.
Shit!
I warned you.
No... what are you doing?
Stop that, Alex, what are you doing?
I don't want to kill you.
Stop it!
I don't want to kill you... stop it!
Easy... easy... easy...
easy... easy...
let's load up, come on...
Let's load up and get out of here.
