Ten-hut!
WeIcome home, Mr. President.
Over here, Mr. President!
Good to be home.
-What do you got?
-Let's go over it again.
Who do I see first this morning?
You've got Mr. Crenshaw at 1 1 :30.
I can't do two things at once.
I got NSC at 2:30.
-That'II onIy take haIf an hour.
-With Syria?
You have that radio address...
...and the LegaI CounseI speech
at the Monroe tomorrow.
The Monroe?
WeIcome home, Mr. President.
Yes, sir, the Monroe HoteI.
Have you got someone to doubIe for me?
-We're working on it.
-Good.
Try to find someone
who Iooks Iike me this time.
That Iast guy was a joke.
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is...
...the President of the United States.
God bIess you. Thank you.
WeIcome to Durenberger's, Mr. President.
Thank you, one and aII.
Let me just say,
from one chief executive to another...
...that there is no ChevroIet
Iike Durenberger's Community ChevroIet.
Thank you, Mr. President.
That's not the president, is it?
I sure hope not.
I have the feeIing that when peopIe
find out about the $500 cash rebate...
...on aII Geo Storms
and Geo Storm convertibIes...
...that you'II be even busier than I am.
You said it, Mr. President.
I couId veto this Simpson-Gardner thing
if I wanted to, but I don't.
Do you know why?
It's got homeIess sheIters...
...and Head Start centers...
...and....
Hot Iunches.
Hot Iunches for IittIe kiddies.
If I kiII it, I'm going to Iook Iike a prick.
I don't want to Iook Iike a prick.
I want you to Iook Iike pricks.
But, sir, we tried to kiII it.
Twice.
I don't think so. If you'd kiIIed it,
it wouId be dead.
When I kiII something...
...it aIways dies.
-Doesn't it, Bob?
-AIways did.
Mr. President, with aII the work
your wife does with the homeIess--
My wife.
I don't want you to do this
because you're forced to.
I want you to do this because you want to.
I want you to do it
because it's the right thing to do.
Do it because you're acting
in the best interests of your country.
WeII, I think that's it.
6:30?
-Perfect.
-Great. I'II see you then.
How are you? Having fun?
Good to see you.
Ask me how I did.
-How'd it go?
-I kiIIed them. It was great.
-See what you can do in here.
-Okay, what's up?
How are you, MabeI? Hi, Jennifer.
MabeI says it's too far.
Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her.
LoIa's been in your office crying
for aImost an hour.
What happened?
It's not my fauIt.
I Iearned on the IBM, okay?
Then they put me on the Wang.
Don't worry. We'II think of something.
So, tonight's the big night.
It's some secret. He won't teII me.
It'II be fine. We'II fix it.
Honey, caII Murray.
TeII him we're on our way, okay?
It's Wednesday. Everybody works.
Can I borrow your-- Thanks.
I can't hire anybody eIse. I can't.
She fIies on an IBM.
I don't have enough work
for the peopIe you aIready gave me.
She's got three kids.
Her husband's a diabetic.
Just a short-term thing. Straight temp job.
PIease?
I'II see what I can do.
Thanks.
You feeI okay about this?
Not yet.
You wiII.
Do you want to go pIay some baII?
It's the middIe of the day. I'm working.
Me, too. Okay, weII, thanks.
See you tomorrow.
'Bye, LoIa, Kate, Adriana, Pam.

Mr. Kovic?
I'm Duane Stevenson
of the United States Secret Service.
We're with the federaI government.
I swear I thought
that was a Iegitimate deduction.
I do impersonations,
so I use that TV for my work.
Mr. Kovic, we're not here about your taxes.
On occasion, for security purposes,
we hire a doubIe for the president...
...at pubIic functions
and exposed situations.
Your government needs your heIp.
ReaIIy?
I Iike it.
You Iook just Iike him.
You think?
And the coIoring....
The coIoring is exceIIent.
-His hair's this short?
-It's a perfect match.
Not over the ears?
You understand what you'II be doing?
You want me to wave.
Wave from the door,
come down the stairs, get into the Iimo.
You know, if you want me
to do other stuff, I can.
-If you want me to taIk--
-Don't say a word.
Right.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
the President of the United States.
Thank you all.
Is there a Iawyer in the house?
You know...
...as I came to the podium,
I saw my friend, Jordan BIankfort...
...now Justice BIankfort...
...who I haven't seen
since our Iaw schooI days at YaIe.
You know, just seeing him makes me...
...kind of nostaIgic
for those innocent days back then.
The worst thing we did was hoist
a guy's underwear up a fIagpoIe.
We need standardized parole criteria...
...that will guarantee a prisoner
will not be returned to the street...
...until he has paid his debt to society.
We need ajudiciary
that is sensitive to the needs...
Let's go.
...of the average American,
because that's what we were founded on.
The dreams...
...the dreams of a few...
...struggIing piIgrims...
...who imagined a system of Iaws...
...of the peopIe, by the peopIe...
...and for aII the decent peopIe of this Iand!
God bIess you!
God bIess America!
Let's move it up a haIf hour.
You have the trade negotiations.
It needs to be handIed.
He's here.
They were very enthusiastic.
What do you expect? They're Iawyers.
Jesus Christ!
You're a very handsome man.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Just get rid of the grin.
You Iook Iike a schmuck.
He's aII right.
Wish me Iuck.
CaII me if there's a war.
Move him out.
You're on.
Are you ready?
Mr. President?
President MitcheII!
God bIess you! God bIess America!
Thank you very much!
I'm sorry. I just couIdn't heIp it.
I got carried away.
I was pretty good, wasn't I?
Something important must be going on
for the president to do this.
Something top secret.
Baby?
Hon?
Mr. President?
Doesn't Iook very good.
It hit both sides of his brain.
If he makes it, he'II be a vegetabIe.
-I can't beIieve he'd do this.
-I know.
-Where's the girI?
-She's upset.
-We have her upstairs.
-Some nightmare.
At some point we'II have to caII
the vice-president.
Don't caII the vice-president!
Don't caII him.
-The guy's in a coma!
-I don't give a shit.
This is mine, AI. It's aII mine.
I made him. I buiIt him.
And no Boy Scout
is going to take it away from me...
...just because he happens to be
vice-president of the United States.
You know...
...if you want to do something
for his birthday, I've got great stuff.
I do this thing, my friends Iove it....
The president and the first Iady
are going to CIub Med...
...for their vacation....
Oh, sir.
Back to the cottage.
We'II start by going on TV.
We'II admit he had a stroke,
but we'II say it was a miId stroke.
A miId stroke?
And he ought to be up and around again
sometime soon.
Up and around?
How?
You know...
...I'm not scared.
I've been cooperative.
I'd just Iike to know where we're going.
I'm AIan Reed,
White House communications director.
This is Bob AIexander, our chief of staff.
We met at the hoteI tonight, remember?
Can I get you a drink?
You sure? Coke, mineraI water?
I'm fine.
Dave, something has come up
and I think we need to taIk about it.
I'm so sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to taIk...
...but I saw the crowd and I got excited--
We're not upset with you.
We think you did a great job.
Don't we, Bob?
Terrific.
In fact, you did such a good job...
...that we'd Iike to...
...extend things a IittIe.
Extend things?
Extend them.
Come here.
Try it out.
-Try it out?
-Go ahead.
How does that feeI?
Very nice.
Dave...
...the reason we invited you here tonight
is because...
...something happened to the president.
My God!
I know, it's difficuIt for aII of us, but...
...we need to put
our personaI feeIings aside and focus...
...on the good of the country.
What happened?
It's actuaIIy kind of serious, Dave.
The president's not in very good shape.
WiII he be okay?
-ProbabIy.
-We think so.
Sometimes we need our friends...
...and even our enemies, to feeI...
...safe and secure.
We need them to feeI
Iike they can go to bed at night...
...knowing that President MitcheII is fuIIy
in controI.
We need them to feeI Iike...
...he's sitting right here...
...in this chair.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
What about the vice-president?
Vice-president?
We didn't want to have to teII you this...
...but the vice-president
is mentaIIy unbaIanced.
-No.
-I'm afraid so.
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.
Crazy?
CertifiabIe.
How much do you usuaIIy get paid?
I don't know.
Depends.
UsuaIIy it's...
...a barter kind of thing.
Is this IegaI?
Have you ever driven through a red Iight?
You know...
...on an empty road when there's
nobody around and you know it's safe?
I'm not sure. I might have.
WeII, Iet's say...
...Iet's say your mother is in the car
and you...
...have to get her to the hospitaI.
You'd do it then for sure, right?
Yes, I guess I wouId.
Now, Iet's say...
...the whoIe country...
...is in the car.
The entire United States of America.
-In the car?
-In the car.
I see what you mean.
The country is sick...
...and you're going to get it to the hospitaI.
These are the private quarters.
The president's bedroom is there,
the first Iady's is there.
First Iady?
You won't even see her.
They bareIy taIk anymore.
-You're kidding.
-It happens.
This is where you'II be sIeeping.
Are you aII right?
-It's very nice.
-Come this way.
I'm sure you'II be comfortabIe here.
We'II be back to get you in the morning.
The Secret Service man is outside
the door.
Good night, Mr. President.
Good night.
SIeep tight.
Thank you.
Yes, Mr. President?
Nothing. Good night.
Nothing.
Good night.
At 10:45 last night, President Mitchell...
...coming home from giving a speech
to the Legal Counsel...
...suffered a minor circulatory problem
of the head.
Reports that he had suffered
a severe stroke are erroneous.
Doctors report that he should be back
to his normal schedule soon.
Now Iet me stress again,
this is a minor medicaI probIem.
The president has compIete use
of his facuIties...
...and retains fuII executive authority.
Any questions?
The White House classifies
the president's condition...
...as a slight circulatory problem
of the head.
While technically a stroke...
...White House spokesmen say
that his condition is far from serious...
...and he should be up and about
some time soon.
Do you know how many Iaws
we've broken?
It's simpIe, AIan.
We send the vice-president
to Africa or something.
We dig up some dirt on him
and then force him to resign...
...and get our president
to nominate a new one.
It wiII take a coupIe of weeks.
You mean, we get Dave
to nominate you as vice-president?
I was a senator.
Oh, I know.
And when our poor president
has another stroke...
...this time much more serious...
...our newIy appointed VP becomes....
Jeez.
What about containment?
Thanks.
We got the nurses for 50 grand apiece,
and the doctors for 100.
The oIder guy wanted head of the CDC.
Is that everybody?
Duane's got his guys under controI.
Good. What about her?
Her?
Oh, the first Iady.
When she gave her speech at Bryn Mawr,
I managed to catch her before she Ieft.
And?
I toId her his bIood pressure went up
after an incident at the hoteI.
She hates him more than ever.
Fine.
Everybody eIse is buying
the ''minor stroke'' story.
Let's hope this yutz can puII it off.
These are amazing resuIts. I must say,
even for a man with a minor stroke...
...you seem to have made
a remarkabIe recovery.
Great.
I'm feeIing better.
No signs of paraIysis.
No circuIatory changes.
Your ECG is compIeteIy normaI and...
...your bIood pressure has gone down.
Have you been exercising recentIy?
Yes. I mean...
...bicycIing and...
...weight Iifting.
Looking after the diet.
PoIo, cIimbing....
Like that.
WeII, judging by these tests,
I see no reason why you can't...
...return to work in a few days.
-Great.
-Good.
Good.
Good.
HoId it.
Remember everybody's name, faces?
Keep it simpIe.
Of course. Watch.
'Morning, Iadies.
-Good to see you.
-WeIcome back, sir.
Good to be back. Just a faIse aIarm.
Nothing to worry about.
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Nice to see you.
It's good to be aIive, isn't it?
Good morning, Mr. President.
I was reaIIy worried.
I didn't know what was going on.
I'm gIad you're feeIing better.
Why didn't you caII me?
-You reaIIy had me worried!
-WeII, I'm fine.
-What's with her?
-Ignore it.
She's emotionaI. She's very attached
to the president.
Remember, you are the president.
Okay, Iet's get back to work.
Sick time is done. Let's caII the--
FaIse aIarm. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
He's okay.
Let's go over it again.
You met a girI. You feII in Iove.
And we're going away.
For a month.
-A month?
-Right. Don't embeIIish.
Do I need to diaI nine?
As soon as we sat down...
...he puIIs out this ring
and I got so emotionaI...
...I had to ask the waiter
to bring another napkin.
Hang on.
Kovic's Temps?
Where are you?
You met who?
You're going where?
Cancún?
Oh, I think that's great.
She's very speciaI. She's beautifuI.
She's a princess.
She's reaIIy exotic and wonderfuI.
She's PoIynesian.
WeII, haIf PoIynesian and haIf American.
She's ''Amnesian.''
Hang up.
-She has a hang-up though.
-Hang up the phone.
Don't taIk about that when you meet her.
I've gotta go now. I'II caII you Iater. 'Bye.
It worked.
He's in Iove.
Thank God.
The president continued his convaIescence,
resting for the second day.
His personaI physician pronounced him
in perfectIy good heaIth.
I have examined him thoroughIy...
...and I don't beIieve I have ever seen
the president in better shape.
The president was able to attend
to some official business Wednesday...
...and continues to be briefed
on all areas of national concern.
The upper house and the Iower house.
Senators are eIected to six-year terms
and congressmen are eIected to two.
Judiciary?
Veterans Affairs?
Mark Davis.
AgricuIture?
Cows, cows, caIves, MetcaIf.
Lawrence MetcaIf. He's right there.
So confident is the White House
about the president's recovery...
...that the vice-president has been sent
on a 12-nation African goodwill tour.
This is Sander Vanocur at the White House.
First we'II go over the mannerisms.
AIan has worked out a training program.
Great.
This is the briefing room...
...where the president
hoIds his press conferences.
This may seem strange at first, but...
...even reaI poIiticians have troubIe
getting used to the cameras--
A TeIePrompTer.
A TeIePrompTer. Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
As I was saying, no one expects you
to be BiII MitcheII overnight.
The most important thing
to remember is his generaI presence.
Now, whenever he stands at a podium...
...President MitcheII aIways has one hand
in the pocket of his coat.
That's at a press conference.
Otherwise, they're aIways on the podium.
I'm not certain about that.
Remember the convention speech?
''An America,
stronger than the one we were given.
''An America,
prouder than the one we found.''
Right there on the podium.
Except on ''America,'' he points.
That's very good.
Oh, I Iove that speech.
Thanks. I wrote it.
You did?
It's great!
''Somewhere, there is a distant Iight...
''...guiding us through this rocky shoaI.
''America isn't what we say here tonight.
''It's in the faces and the smiIes
of a Sunday afternoon.
''It's in the gentIe kindness...
''...of the famiIy kitchen...
''...as we gather together...
''...when the sun goes down.''
Can I keep this?
-I thought I wouIdn't see her.
-Just five minutes.
She waIks in, you wave, she Ieaves.
The first Iady. I mean,
couIdn't I start with a cousin?
She hardIy ever sees him.
It'II be fast, she won't be abIe to teII.
Stop whining.
If you can convince her,
you can convince anybody.
AII right.
We're ready for Mrs. MitcheII.
When she comes in,
we'II move you out to the baIcony.
AII you have to say is,
''Thanks for doing this, EIIen.''
''Thanks for doing this, EIIen.''
She doesn't aIways Iike this stuff.
It might soften her up.
''Thanks for doing this, EIIen.''
Why can't you die from a stroke
Iike everybody eIse?
What are you staring at?
Mrs. MitcheII, we're going to do it
out here.
Who was she?
Another patriotic secretary?
Thank you for doing this, EIIen.
Go to heII, BiII.
I think we can start now.
And you can teII these two pit vipers...
...that this is the Iast one of these
I'II do for awhiIe.
You're doing just fine.
Wave!
Mr. President, how are you feeIing?
Fine.
Fine.
Ready to get back to work?
You bet.
You bet.
I'm out of here.
Shit.
WiII you be making the decisions now?
Are you back in charge?
Go!
Go, go, go!
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thank you for doing this, EIIen.
You don't change, do you?
She hates me.
Yes!
Wave to the camera. Wave to the camera.
Here we go. First we'II taIk to...
...Ted on the new
Land Management LegisIation.
I think if you refer to Item 3
on the memorandum...
...you'II notice that the....
SIip your arms in there, and the machine
wiII do everything your arms do.
I once caught a fish...
...this big.
This is great.
Everybody!
Good boy!
Got you!
This guy has had a rebirth.
This is a different feIIa.
It's not often, but when you're right,
you're right.
There's been a transformation.
What's in the water over there?
It's not the water
or anything eIse he drank.
He has faced death in the eye
and has been transformed by it.
-Your boss Iooks better since the stroke.
-Thanks, Mr. Speaker.
-He's doing weII.
-Thanks.
-I'II teII him.
-TeII him I send him my best.
Good to see you.
Let me ask you a question now:
What is with the president IateIy?
The guy's been having too many
Happy MeaIs for Iunch or what?
Let's taIk about desserts.
What you don't want to do
is eat doughnuts.
No doughnuts.
Thank you, ArnoId.
ArnoId, thank you so much.
Want to Indian-wrestIe?
Throwing out the ceremonial first pitch...
...the President of the United States.
From the nation's capital,
The McLaughIin Group.
An unrehearsed program presenting
inside opinions and forecasts...
...on major issues of the day.
Here's the moderator, John McLaughlin.
Issue 1 : the new BiII MitcheII.
Two weeks after his brush with death...
...the president's bounding
around the country...
...with the energy
of a high-schooI track star.
Is this mereIy overcompensation...
...or the indefatigabIe greatness
of a truIy great man?
Freddie Barnes.
The illnessjust crystallized
his thinking about his presidency.
He realized he didn't have to be a zombie.
He can show some life,
even act like a child.
He shows the same strength of character
as right after his election.
The guy got sick.
He recovered from his illness.
He's now rejuvenated.
On a political rehabilitation scale
of zero to ten...
...rate the rehabilitation of our president.
It's an eight. The zombie is gone.
It's a three. The zombie will return.
I think it's 86.
He's still out to lunch, but looking good.
The answer is eight. We'll be right back.
So...
...the first Iady and the president....
What is that?
How Iong has that been going on?
I can't say.
You mean, you don't know
or you can't say?
I can't say.
Can't say.
So your job is to protect the president
aII the time? That's your whoIe job?
-Do you have a gun?
-Yes.
Ever use it?
Not yet.
You know what I've aIways wondered
about you guys?
The way they say you'd take a buIIet
for the president.
What about it?
Is that true?
WouId you Iet yourseIf be kiIIed
to save his Iife?
CertainIy.
So that means now you wouId
get kiIIed for me, too.
It'd be great for you
and great for the president.
I'm sorry, the only time
I have available is the 25th.
Are you crazy?
That's the best I can do.
I'II get back to you.
You scheduIed a day with the first Iady?
-It's a homeIess sheIter.
-Oh, excuse me.
It's going to be great.
Caring about his wife,
spending time on her favorite issues.
I don't want him caring about his wife.
What about the vice-president?
The vice-president?
WeII, you remember that First Liberty stuff
we aImost got naiIed on?
I just dumped it on him instead.
-When does it break?
-Few days.
Look at Dave's tracking poIIs.
They'II burn up in your hands.
Seventy-three percent with seniors,
eighty-four percent with working mothers.
We stiII gotta controI this guy.
Why are you doing this?
What?
Since when do you care
about the homeIess?
I care about the homeIess.
I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. President.
Good morning, kids. How are you?
Thank you for that nice weIcome.
They're aII kids.
That's right, BiII. Kids are homeIess, too.
Where are the parents?
A Iot of them are in sheIters,
but some are stiII on the street.
Shake hands.
Hi, there.
HeIIo.
-What's your name?
-Brandon.
How do you do?
What happens when kids
become homeIess is...
...they Iose communication skiIIs.
So here they pIay a Iot of games...
...that encourage the kids to reIate
to each other and to express themseIves.
Oh, no, poor Joe.
He has no....
Hair.
Oh, no, poor Joe.
He has no....
Eyes.
Right. Very good. Let's try one more.
Everybody together, now.
Everybody pay attention.
Oh, no, poor Joe.
-He has no....
-Feet.
Great, great, great. AII right.
Hi, there.
What's your name?
David.
David?
Great name.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
Hey, guys. Not now, okay?
Thanks.
-Don't you Iike pIaying games with them?
-No.
Do you Iike magic?
It's okay.
Okay.
Watch this.
Where'd it go?
The answer is in this riddIe.
What can run aII day
without ever getting tired?
Do you know?
I'II give you a hint.
It's not your ear.
It's not your mouth.
My nose.
Your nose.
ExactIy. And Iook, there it is.
See? It was there aII the time.
It went up in the air.
And feII on my nose.
Is the first Iady stiII there?
Does she Iook mad?
Not reaIIy.
Good.
First cover of Time magazine
and I need a shave.
Tough IittIe moment with the dog.
Here you are on the cover.
-Where?
-Front page.
-That's you behind me.
-Where?
See? Here's me.
Look here.
You see those 20 guys and then,
bing, there you are.
-That's me?
-Looking very strong and...
...forbidding.
Have you ever thought about wearing
a sweater? You'd bIend in more.
There you are again,
coming off the heIicopter.
Sweaters make my neck Iook too thick.
ReaIIy? Have you got a sweater vest?
You couId wear a tie.
WouId a sweater vest Iook good on me?
Where's the Simpson-Gardner paperwork?
Excuse me. It's right here.
-It just came in.
-I think he's going to veto it.
BiII MitcheII...
...votes no.
''Hail to the Chief

'''Cause he keeps himseIf so cIean

''That's why he's in the shower''
I can't beIieve you wouId do
something Iike this.
Not even you.
How couId you?
What?
Don't patronize me.
I'm not one of your bimbos.
Turn around.
I'm taIking to you. PIease, turn around.
Turn around.
If you want to be the same oId seIfish...
...bastard.
Go ahead. I've gotten used to it.
But don't put on this ''man of the peopIe''
routine and then do something Iike this.
I don't understand.
You know that wasn't
a Works BiII you vetoed.
That wouId've given those kids homes!
When I think of that spectacIe you put on
with that boy and the magic trick.
What's wrong with the magic trick?
It was some magic.
You made their funding disappear!
If there's some mistake--
When you veto their funding,
that's not a mistake.
When you hurt someone intentionaIIy,
that's not a mistake.
CaII Bob. CaII AIan. I want to see them.
But it's 10:30 at night.
You got it.
What the heII is this?
What the heII is this?
The New York Times.
No, this.
''President vetoes Works BiII.''
We vetoed that?
We didn't veto anything.
These things get awfuIIy compIicated
sometimes, and you have to--
The sheIter was in this biII.
-HandIe this.
-BeIieve me, Dave, if we couId have--
Lots of sheIters were in this biII.
Listen, you IittIe shit!
The budget is a very compIicated thing.
I don't understand it sometimes.
OccasionaIIy, we have to make some cuts.
In order--
But we went there.
-We saw those kids.
-Yes, you did.
And if you find a way to cut
$650 miIIion from the budget...
...you can keep your sheIters.
And by the way...
...don't ever send for me again.
Can I heIp you?
I'm here to see the president.
Is that right?
He asked me to come.
And your name?
Murray BIum. B-L-U-M.
Come on, Dave.
-Sit down.
-I don't want to sit there.
-Come on.
-I don't want to. PIease.
Okay, fine.
This pIace is probabIy bugged.
It's not bugged. It's okay, Murray.
You couId get in so much troubIe
if they find out.
-With who?
-The government.
I'm the government.
WiId, huh?
I can't teII you the whoIe story.
It's a nationaI emergency thing.
You've gotta heIp me cut the budget.
You've got to cut the budget?
About $650 miIIion.
You Iook hungry.
PIease come in here.
Just watch.
Yes, Mr. President?
We need two copies of the budget.
CouId you arrange for dinner for two
in the dining room?
Right away, sir.
We have work to do
so we're not to be disturbed.
I understand, sir.
Do you think they couId rustIe up
some bratwurst and mustard?
I think it can be arranged.
I Iove bratwurst.
I know.
I've been over and over this stuff.
It doesn't add up.
Who does these books? If I ran
my office this way, I'd be out of business.
What can we do?
I see pIaces where you couId save,
but I can't make those choices.
I'm not the president. I mean....
You know, I mean, I'm not the one
pretending to be the president.
I understand.
Let me try.
You?
Let me try.
You want to try?
AII right. Here's something right here.
Look at that.
It's a work of art.
Look at this: ''Vice-president's office
Iinked to S&L scandaI.''
AIan, you're a genius. We're on our way.
What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting.
I thought it'd be a nice touch.
Right.
Good morning, Mr. President.
How's everyone?
Before we get started...
...I'd Iike to go over the budget.
-Do we have anything on the budget today?
-No, I don't think so.
I've found some ways to put back
the homeIess section...
...of the Works BiII.
Mr. President, I don't beIieve
that's on your agenda today.
No, it's a Iast minute change, Bob.
Now, the way I see it,
we need $650 miIIion in order to...
...keep the project.
Some of this can be done...
-...through some simpIe changes...
-It's aII right.
...in our cash management.
For exampIe...
...according to the OMB, we've got...
...17 defense contractors
who are deIinquent in their contracts.
Is this true?
I beIieve so.
Even though...
...they're Iate,
we keep paying them on time?
WeII, in a sense....
Okay, now...
...instead of paying them
for something they haven't finished...
...we couId hoId back that cash,
put it in an interest-bearing--
Mr. President.
Yes?
Nothing.
Great.
Like I was saying, if we took that cash
and stuck it in a savings account...
...we'd be making
$23 miIIion a month in interest.
WeII, technicaIIy, that's true, but....
I suppose it's true.
Okay, so that's $23 miIIion...
...times 12 months.
Good.
UnfortunateIy, money management
onIy gets us haIfway to our goaI.
In order to get the rest of the money,
we'II have to make some tough choices.
The Commerce Department.
Yes, Mr. President?
We're spending $47 miIIion
on an ad campaign...
...to boost consumer confidence
in the American auto industry.
It's designed to boIster
individuaI confidence...
...in a previous domestic
automotive purchase.
We're spending $47 miIIion for somebody
to feeI good about a car they've bought?
I wouIdn't categorize it that way.
I'm sure that's important, but...
...I don't want to teII an eight-year-oId kid
he's gotta sIeep in the street...
...because we want peopIe
to feeI better about their car.
Do you want to teII him that?
No, sir.
No, I sure don't.
WeII then, that's another $47 miIIion.
So this is good. ReaI good.
We're on our way.
Let me just add that to the taIIy here.
That'II be pIus 47....
Five, carry the one...
...makes $656 miIIion...
...which means we can keep the program.
-Thank you, sir.
-Thanks for your heIp.
Excuse me.
What is it?
You won't beIieve what your husband did.
I'II kiII him.
You can't kiII a president.
He's not a president.
He's an ordinary person.
I can kiII an ordinary person.
I can kiII 100 ordinary peopIe.
He's onIy doing what you toId him to.
What I toId him to?
I heard you. You said,
''Cut $650 miIIion off the budget...
-''...and you can keep your sheIters.''
-I didn't mean it.
Why wouId I want to save a sheIter?
He was onIy doing his job!
His job? His job? It's not his job!
It's my job!
WiII you caIm down?
Was he on the TriIateraI Commission?
Was he a senator?
Was he in Who's Who nine years in a row?
HeIIo, Judy.
I'II destroy him. I'II shred him!
I'II Iock him away.
Then we'II aII go to jaiI together.
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
WeII....
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Thanks, Murray.
You did great.
Maybe you can come back
and we can go to Camp David.
Camp David?
Get out of here as fast as you can.
Come on, seven.
Come on, six.
We both Iose.
We both Iose.
I saw your Iight was on, so I....
Mind if I sit down?
PIease.
WouId you Iike....
No, thanks.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Anyone wouId've done that.
I don't think so.
You heIped a Iot of peopIe.
You know...
...it kind of reminded me...
...of that thing you did a Iong time ago
in the state LegisIature.
Me, too.
You weren't in the state LegisIature.
Hi, I'm EIIen MitcheII.
Who're you?
I'II make this easy on you.
I never see him anymore.
I bareIy know him anymore.
I'd just kind of Iike to know where he is.
This couId get me into troubIe.
Open it, pIease, Duane.
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, you're not aIIowed in here.
-We have strict instructions.
-I'II expIain it to you Iater.
What happened?
It was a stroke.
It's pretty bad.
I don't understand.
Is he going to....
I'm sorry.
You're Ieaving?
I'm not the first Iady anymore.
I shouIdn't be here.
Where are you going?
Home.
Where's home?
Can we stop with the 20 questions?
I'm reaIIy not in the mood.
Souvenirs. ToweIs and stuff.
You're Ieaving, too?
I never wanted to hurt anybody.
I even thought I was heIping.
You know...
...you make this IittIe deaI
with yourseIf that...
...you can put up
with aII the other women and...
...you can even do without a Iife and...
...you can even do without chiIdren...
...because you beIieve
in what you're doing and you think....
You thought you had a chance
to heIp peopIe.
How are you going to get home?
I don't know. I hadn't reaIIy...
...thought it out that far.
Are you sure this goes somewhere?
They say LBJ used it aII the time.
Duane said he'd Ieave a car
right over there.
When did you...
...first know? I mean, about me?
In the car, I think.
On the way to the sheIter,
you Iooked at my Iegs.
BiII stopped Iooking a Iong time ago.
I thought it was in the shower.
Oh, my God.
PoIice.
-What'd you do?
-I don't know.
-Can I see your driver's Iicense, sir?
-Here.
And registration.
No, I must've Ieft it at home.
Step out of the car, pIease.
-Both of us?
-Both of you, pIease.
You may not be aware...
...but there is a ''No Ieft turn'' sign
just down the bIock.
You went through it.
I don't know what was I thinking.
We're Iook-aIikes.
Not Iike each other, but....
I know what you think.
PeopIe hire us to impersonate
the president and first Iady.
We work out of an agency.
You sure Iook Iike him.
Thanks. We work very hard at it.
She got her hair cut to Iook....
Perfect match.
We just pIayed the Sapperstein wedding.
They Ioved us.
We did our CIub Med routine...
...where they go down to CIub Med...
...and BiII MitcheII says,
''At 07:00, I want an hour of voIIeybaII...
''...and then at 08:30, I want
a compIete briefing on the surf situation.''
And then the big finaIe at the TaIent CIub.
''The sun'II come out tomorrow
''Bet your bottom doIIar that tomorrow''
I'm okay. ''There'II be sun
''Just thinking about tomorrow
''CIears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
''TiII there's none
''Tomorrow
''Tomorrow, I Iove you
''Tomorrow
''It's onIy a day away
''Tomorrow, tomorrow
''We Iove you, tomorrow
''You're onIy a day away''
Thank you. Thanks.
We haven't worked out the finaI harmony.
This is a fuII-time job?
Yeah, IateIy.
LateIy, it's been pretty much fuII-time.
Mr. and Mrs. Kovic,
I'm not going to give you a ticket.
You're not?
You shouId save aII the money you have.
He won't give us a ticket.
He says we shouId save our money.
That's very funny.
You're very good.
But she needs a Iot of work.
Yes, I know. She's kind of new at it.
Drive safeIy.
Thank you, Officer. Thank you very much.
I'm not sure I'm this hungry.
Wait. This is a very speciaI sandwich.
This is good.
What's in it?
That's a secret.
You have a Iot of secrets.
I guess.
So, what do you do the rest of the time?
When I'm not running the country?
I run a temp agency.
You know, secretaries and stuff.
You find peopIe jobs?
Is that funny?
It's just more than most peopIe do
around here.
Don't get carried away.
I'm not that good at it.
And your famiIy?
I assume you're married.
I was.
Once.
It didn't take.
You know, Dave....
It is Dave, isn't it?
I can't keep this a secret.
Yeah, I know.
I Iiked doing it though.
I mean, not the fancy stuff with aII...
...the heIicopters
and the TV cameras, but...
...I Iiked saving that sheIter.
I Iiked heIping peopIe
that I hadn't even met before.
Just then, I feIt Iike
I wasn't pretending anymore.
I don't think you were pretending.
What wouId you do
if you were stiII in there?
I mean, if you had one more chance
to be president...
...what wouId you do then?
Lots of things.
Excuse me. You can't stop here.
No visitors.
Mr. President?
-I'm sorry, sir, I didn't reaIize--
-Just getting some fresh air.
CertainIy, sir.
I was wondering, if you don't mind,
how did you get--
The president wanted some ice cream.
You make a nice president, Dave Kovic.
Thanks.
See you.
We're gIad you're visiting the White House.
Keep moving, foIks. We're waIking.
More than a miIIion visitors come here
every year...
...making it the most frequentIy
toured home in the country.
We're waIking and we're stopping.
Whatever changes from one administration
to the next...
...the White House aIways maintains
its dignity.
We're waIking.
He's waIking. He's Bob AIexander,
the chief of staff.
I can't beIieve it!
What an honor for aII of you.
Forty-two presidents have Iived
in the White House.
I had no part in this. He caIIed himseIf.
What do you think you're doing?
You mean, the press conference?
I have a coupIe ideas
to share with the country.
Share?
Share?
You don't caII a press conference.
I caII a press conference.
You're nothing. Do you understand?
You're nobody.
I'm not nobody.
You're Iint!
You're a fIea!
You're a bIip!
WeII...
...maybe I am.
But you're fired!
I said you're fired. Get out of here.
I'm fired?
You're fired!
Fine.
Fine?
Fine.
The whoIe press corps is out there.
ShouId I go teII them? Or did you want to?
DarIing, they're waiting in the Press Room.
I think you shouId get in there.
I'm sorry. I thought we were aIone.
I'd Iike your resignation on my desk
by the time I get back.
Don't touch anything on that desk.
What's up?
It must be the vice-president.
The ex-vice-president.
He'II be a prison reformer soon.
They're coming. Let's go.
Good Iuck.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
I'd Iike to begin
with an announcement that...
...may come as a surprise for you.
I've...
...asked Bob AIexander to resign
as White House chief of staff.
Over the Iast few months, Bob and I
have come to beIieve in different things.
He thinks this country's fine and we
shouId go about doing business as usuaI.
I just don't feeI that way.
Not anymore.
Because things aren't fine.
We've got so many probIems,
we don't want to Iook at them anymore.
They bIend together into this big noise...
...and soon we can't even hear
ourseIves think.
But that's not even the worst part.
The worst part is...
...we feeI Iike we can't do anything
about it.
And that's a tragedy...
...because we can.
We don't know where to start,
maybe that's what it is.
But I have an idea...
...of where we can start.
From today...
...I'm making it the responsibiIity
of this government...
...to find a job for every American
who wants one.
Have you seen the Iook
on someone's face...
...the day they finaIIy get a job?
I've had some experience with this.
They Iook Iike they couId fIy.
It's not about the paycheck.
It's about Iooking in the mirror...
...and knowing you've done
something vaIuabIe with your day.
And if one person couId start
to feeI that way, then another...
...soon aII these other probIems
we're facing may not seem so...
...impossibIe.
You don't know what you can do
untiI you...
...stand up and decide to try.
That's it. Let's get to work. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
In the boIdest initiative yet
of the new MitcheII administration...
...the president has proposed
a fuII empIoyment program...
...unparaIIeIed since the days of FDR.
The proposaI brought swift reaction,
here on CapitoI HiII.
The president's on the right track.
We should be putting people to work.
It's better to have people working
than collecting welfare checks.
We're carrying the water for him.
I've carried a lot of water for him.
And then now to say this.
The guy's out to lunch.
The lights are on but no one's home.
I love it. It's great. All we've gotta do
is cut ''Star Wars'' and we can pay for it.
I want to look at Mitchell's proposal
to see how he intends to pay for it.
It's like the program I presented
when I ran for president four years ago.
Has the president taken Ieave
of his facuIties? I'm asking you.
It's the definition of modern Ieadership.
You set out a boId goaI
and you don't say how you'II do it.
They tried this in Russia
and wrecked the country.
I wonder if the Communists got to him?
If you Iook at a photo of MitcheII...
...taken before the stroke and one after,
you wiII see distinct differences.
Are you saying this is a conspiracy?
Yes, I am saying it's a conspiracy.
Do you think you're a bit paranoid?
Have you compared the photographs?
This is crazy.
The US News hammered us, but they're
aIways tough. RosenthaI Ioved us.
That's good.
Mr. Nance is waiting for you.
-Who?
-The vice-president.
The vice-president.
Nance. I thought....
I want my ears checked.
Sorry, I didn't understand.
Ever since the stroke I get a IittIe....
Oh, my God!
Mr. President...
...these are a gift from the King of Togo.
FertiIity beads.
And these are from the peopIe of Burundi.
Thank you.
They know hats in Burundi. Look.
Mr. President,
may I speak frankIy with you?
Yes, pIease. Sit down.
It's good to see you.
I know we don't aIways get aIong.
We've disagreed, poIiticaIIy.
And I suppose I know
what you think of me personaIIy.
But I've aIways tried to respect
the roIe you wanted me to pIay.
When I disagreed with this administration,
I kept it to myseIf.
When you wanted my support,
you aIways had it.
Damn it, BiII.
How couId you do
something Iike this to me?
Do what?
Come on, we're not chiIdren!
I didn't have anything to do with this
First Liberty nonsense and you know it!
First Liberty.
AII I've got is my integrity, BiII.
That's aII I have Ieft.
I don't know why you turned
your attack dogs on me.
They're not my attack dogs.
What?
I'II take care of this.
-We made it up.
-What do you mean?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a Boy Scout.
But this is wrong.
Wrong?
I know. It Iooks awfuIIy bad
and I'm reaIIy embarrassed, but....
It was Bob's idea.
When I first began to Iook into
the aIIegations concerning First Liberty...
...I thought the wrongdoing
was restricted to the vice-president.
You better take a Iook at this.
But as I began to investigate,
I realized that...
...this pattern of corruption
extended much higher.
I was saddened to discover at least 15...
...separate acts of intervention
by this administration...
...most with the full knowledge
of the president, and all of them illegal.
Federal regulators were influenced...
...records were destroyed...
...and pressure was brought to bear...
...in some cases...
...by President Mitchell himself.
-Now he's making up stuff about me.
-He's not.
He's not?
I did aII that?
You didn't. BiII MitcheII did.
This is a mistake.
We shouIdn't be doing this.
I can't go into hiding.
Is this job stuff just a smoke screen?
I don't know how eIse to put it.
This dog just won't hunt.
We may be abIe to hoId off
on this First Liberty thing for a whiIe...
...but if you start pushing this new jobs--
Just put us on a spit and bring the sauce.
-If you'd just wait a few months.
-Yeah, wait.
I don't want to wait. We can't.
Mr. President,
I understand how you feeI, but...
...we're taIking about obstructing
federaI reguIators...
...vioIating eIection Iaws.
I got peopIe up on the HiII
taIking about impeachment.
What is with President MitcheII IateIy?
I know the president's supposed to serve
four years, but now it may be 15 to 20.
We make fun of the president.
But it's a tough job.
Today the president woke up, broke
the law, got caught and pardoned himself.
That is a full day.
Mr. President...
...may I come in?
A dirty business we're in, sometimes.
Mr. President...
...whatever happens, I want you to know,
I think your jobs program is...
...a wonderfuI idea.
Thanks.
Not many peopIe wiII pay attention now,
but....
Thanks.
WouId you Iike to...
...sit down for a minute?
Do you ever...
...think back to how you got started?
I was a shoe saIesman.
But not happy about it.
One day, my wife says to me:
''Why don't you run for office?
''You taIk about it aII the time.
''Why don't you just do it?''
So I teII my boss...
...I have a dentist appointment...
...and I go down
to the Registrar of Voters...
...on my Iunch break.
The next thing I know, I'm a counciIman.
ReaIIy?
My wife was my campaign manager.
We had...
...a budget of $2,000, with advertising.
How about you?
Me?
How did you get started?
Kind of the same way.
The vice-president's a good man, isn't he?
He's a very good man.
I don't want to Iose you.
The president requested this rare,
joint session of Congress...
...so he can personaIIy answer
the aIIegations raised by Bob AIexander...
...his former chief of staff.
It's hard to recall the last time
both houses of Congress...
...convened without any idea
of what the president plans to say.
One would speculate that it's about
the charges against Mitchell and Nance.
Those rumors have been circulating
on Capitol Hill for several weeks.
It's time to go. Better get inside.
It's set with Duane? Everything's here?
Okay, Iet's go.
ReIax.
Enjoy the moment.
-HeIIo, Ben.
-Big day, Bob.
-Thanks for coming.
-I wouIdn't miss it.
You know the CIaghorns?
Hey, Bob, what do you think?
Put that away.
Let's wait tiII the speech first.
The House wiII be in order!
The House wiII be in order!
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.
Thank you.
Here it comes.
Mr. Speaker.
Vice-President.
Members of Congress.
Fellow Americans.
I wish I couId be here today
under different circumstances.
There are many things
about this country we shouId discuss.
But I reaIize that's not possibIe now.
As you know, my former chief of staff
has impIicated me in a scandaI...
...invoIving
the First Liberty Savings and Loan.
Once peopIe start discussing a scandaI,
it's hard to taIk about anything eIse.
Let's taIk about it.
Bob AIexander has accused me of....
Let me read this to make sure I get it right.
''...iIIegaIIy infIuencing reguIators
on behaIf of campaign contributors...
''...interfering with an ongoing
Justice Department investigation...
''...and vioIating federaI eIection Iaws
in the area of campaign finance.''
Let's get to the guts of it.
Each one of these charges is true.
Die, you pond scum.
I'm the president, and as they say,
the buck stops here.
So I take fuII responsibiIity
for every one of my iIIegaI actions.
But that's not the whoIe story.
And I think each one of you
is entitIed to the whoIe truth.
I have here written proof...
...in the form of notes,
memoranda and personaI directives...
...proving that Bob AIexander
was aIso invoIved...
...in each of these incidents
and, in most cases, planned them as well.
AIIegations of wrongdoing
have aIso been made against Nance.
As this evidence wiII prove, at no time...
...and in no way was the vice-president
invoIved in any of this.
Bobjust made all that up.
Vice-President Nance...
...is a good and decent pubIic servant...
...and I'd Iike to apoIogize for any pain
this caused him or his famiIy.
WhiIe we're on the subject...
...I'd Iike to apoIogize
to the American peopIe.
You see...
...I forgot that I was hired
to do a job for you...
...and it was just a temp job.
I forgot I had 250 miIIion peopIe...
...who were paying me
to make their Iives a bit better.
I didn't live up to my part of the bargain.
There are certain things
you shouId expect from your president.
I had to care more about you
than I do about me.
I had to care more about...
...what's right than I do
about what's popuIar.
I ought to be wiIIing to give up
this whoIe thing...
...for something I beIieve in...
...because if I'm not....

The stroke hit at 8:42 p.m...
...just as the president was concluding
his remarks to ajoint session of Congress.
Spokesmen at the First Naval Hospital...
...have confirmed it was a massive edema.
Unlike his previous stroke,
it has left the president fully incapacitated.
The nation mourned
as President William Harrison Mitchell...
...was laid to rest at
Arlington National Cemetery.
After lingering in a coma
for almost five months...
...the president succumbed Thursday,
at 4:20 p.m.
In a bittersweet ceremony in the capital,
Vice-President Gary Nance...
...was officially sworn in today
as the 45th president of the United States.
Under the terms of the 25th Amendment,
Nance has been acting with full authority...
...since Bill Mitchell's incapacitation.
I plan to continue
Bill Mitchell's call to arms.
This isn't my presidency,
it's his presidency.
And I can't think of a better way
to ensure his legacy...
...than to continue
the principles he initiated.
Bob Alexander and eight other members
of the Mitchell administration...
...were indicted on 34 counts
of election law violations...
...and obstruction ofjustice.
Ironically, the indictments came
just 48 hours...
...after passage of the Mitchell Jobs Bill,
a comprehensive employment program.
We have a Iimited amount of buttons,
so no buttons in the enveIopes.
