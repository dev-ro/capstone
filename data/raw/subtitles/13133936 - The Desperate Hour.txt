Hey.

Hi.

Not great.

Yeah, but I'm in a car now.

No, I'm barely holding on. I
shouldn't have made him go.
I shouldn't.
[DEDRA] Listen, this is not
your fault, Amy.
Yeah, it's mine. I should have
just let him stay home,
and left him alone.
[DEDRA] You did what any
other mom would do.
You got your son up when he
couldn't get up on his own.
You got him on his
feet, and made sure
he got to where he needed to be.
Because he's your child, and
because you love him.
Simple as that. You didn't know
today was going to be like this.
Nobody did. That's my point.
And he knows that, Mrs. Carr.
He's not blaming you.
He's holding on to
you right now.

[REPORTER] A moment too
horrific and too tragic
has unfortunately
happened again.
Former graduate of Lakewood High
School, Robert Ellis,
stormed the school
Friday morning,
taking hostages for several
hours before a SWAT team
was able to free a group of
students held captive
in a second floor classroom.
[STUDENT] I just,
I saw kids running,
and I was running too,
and then Ms. Dwyer told us
to go into a classroom
and turn off the lights
like we practiced. But we just
heard more shots.
And we were afraid he
was going to shoot
through the door,
but he just kept going.
So, we started to run
away, and we just ran...
♪♪♪
Hey, it's me, Noah.
Day 100 of doing this,
posting this.
Day I think 107 since what
happened at my school,
our school, if...
Yeah, you know.
♪♪♪
Hearing a lot of what
you've had to say,
it's inspired me to keep
doing this, to stand up.
Today seems kind of like
a milestone, I guess.
A hundred days of these videos.
A lot's changed in that time.
For me, my life feels like
things are finally starting
to get better.
It's not gone, it'll never
be gone.
I want to keep active, I want to
keep talking to everybody
because this has to stop. It
should have stopped before.
Kids shouldn't have to go
to school and worry
about this happening to them.
And that's why I'm going
to keep doing
whatever I can to
help, you know.
'Cause I know some of you can't.
And I'm going to keep talking
about how wrong this is
because there's no
other way to say it.
And that's why
I won't stay quiet,
and I hope you won't either.
