QUIET CHAOS
Sorry!
Why sorry?
It's my point!
- 9-7!
- What do you mean, 9-7?
What's your rule for scoring?
If in doubt, it's yours?
The rule is if you miss,
the other person scores.
You want to win every time.
Everyone knows that!
- What's the score then?
- Eight all.
Help!
Eleonora!
Help!
What'll we do?
No, don't go in!
- What's happening?
- It's dangerous!
- Oh, fuck off!
- Wait!
Help!
Let go of me!
Keep still!
Don't let go of me!
I'm dying!
You're not dying!
I'm dying!
Don't let go of me!
Carlo!
What the fuck...!
Keep still!
- Don't let go of me!
- Keep still!
Eleonora!
Lean on me.
Where's Carlo?
There you are!
- Know what the best thing is?
- What?
We'll walk over there,
and no one will thank us.
Because no one realised
we're the ones who saved them.
- Don't be silly!
- You'll see.
What a bunch of shits!
We rescued a couple of bitches
on a beach full of shitheads!
But they're like that here.
I wonder why Dad
bought a house here.
Shut up, Carlo,
those poor wretches nearly drowned.
Poor wretches? A pair
of bitches loaded with money.
Mine was disagreeable too,
she didn't help...
What was yours like?
- What was yours like?
- How do I know!
Was she pretty?
- Was she pretty?
- I don't know. Stupid!
Stop laughing!
Did you fancy her?
Carlo, we almost drowned,
all four of us!
I didn't look at her! I saved her!
You're crazy, you're a maniac!
What's going on?
Hello.
Your Dad is here.
Daddy!
Where were you?
I called you three times.
Why didn't you come straight back?
Mom fell.
Where were you?!
- Call me if you need anything.
- All right.
Bye, sweetie.
The offer is more interesting
than we thought.
- That's not the problem.
- What is then?
This way we'll offer Steiner
the monopoly of European Pay TV.
Think he's tougher than me?
In two years we'll have the monopoly.
Don't start again.
Jean-Claude and I wanted to say,
and I'm sure Pietro will agree...
The plan was
to expand on our own,
and consolidate
without the Americans.
After the merger, we can't go back.
Know how much shares will rise
the first day? 18%.
We won't get the chance again.
And if you don't see that,
I won't repeat it!
Yes.
Paladini, have you any comments?
No, sorry.
Pietro, what do you think?
I really can't work out
what the problem is.
I'll be outside.
Good morning.
- How are things?
- Fine, thanks.
Good morning.
Samuele! Hello!
You are here then?
Where were you?
- With the bosses.
- Will the merger take place?
It appears so.
From what I could make out...
it sounds like it.
- You do know it's stupid?
- No, because...
I haven't made
my mind up about it.
I'll have to sack people!
Claudia's here too!
- Hello!
- Darling!
- How are things?
- Fine.
These are the other
telegrams, sir.
- Yes, I'll read them later.
- All right.
- Annalisa?
- Yes?
Can you help me find the red shoes?
We have to go.
- I want to finish this.
- Here they are!
You've found the shoes.
Come on!
- You do the border...
- That's easy!
It's green.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
Claudia!
- Claudia, are you ready?
- I'm coming!
Come on, we'll be late.
Can you tie my pony-tail?
Yes, are you wearing tights?
What do I do?
Twist it round twice.
Twist it round twice.
Once!
Twice!
Well... maybe your hair
looks better loose.
Okay, I'll get Benedetta to do it.
Let's go. Where's your school-bag?
It's light.
Haven't you packed it?
There are no books in it.
The school gives them to us.
Here we are, come on.
Ready?
- Please, Dad!
- Can't I hold it?
No, I don't want you to.
- I'm really sorry.
- Thank you.
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hello, little one.
The headmistress
would like to talk to you.
Some other time, maybe.
The teachers have put us together.
- Bye, Benedetta, bye, Claudia.
- Bye!
Hello, Pietro. How are you coping?
Call me any time you need.
If you go away on business...
You know Claudia
and Benedetta are close.
- That's true.
- Promise?
- Bye.
- Bye, have a good day.
Claudia.
Listen, sweetie,
I'll wait here for you.
- Yes, all right.
- What do you mean?
I tell you what.
I won't move until you come out.
Yes, okay.
- I'll be here.
- All right, bye.
- I'll be here.
- Yes, I heard. Bye.
Bye.
- Are you leaving?
- No, I've only just got here.
Annalisa, it's me.
Listen... I won't be in this morning.
You have an appointment
at 11 with Anica.
And one at midday about
the live broadcast of the festival.
Cancel them both. I might
have to go to the solicitor.
Do you need anything?
I'm not going to the solicitor's.
I'm in front of my daughter's school.
I told her I'd wait here
until she came out.
So I'm staying here.
The president has asked about you.
What shall I tell him?
Tell him that...
Tell him the truth,
I'm outside the school...
That I'm not coming in today,
I'll see him tomorrow.
All right?
Listen...
It's a nice day today,
I can do some work in the car.
- All right? Bye.
- Goodbye.
"Rats live...
on no evil star"
This sentence is a palindrome.
What's a palindrome?
It's a sentence or a word
you can read back-to-front.
So...
Shall we try it together?
Rats...
live on a no evil...
star.
Reversible things are those
you can... turn round.
Shall we have some examples?
- Eating.
- Why's that?
Because you can throw up afterwards.
- Livia!
- Get dirty...
Because you can wash it off.
- Get dressed.
- Score a goal.
No, when you've scored,
you can't unscore it.
In that case it's irreversible,
because you can't turn it around.
Let's carry on.
Now you try to write a word
that can be read back-to-front.
All right?
Get to work then!
A list of the airlines I have
flown with:
Excuse me,
do you make anything
else besides sandwiches for lunch?
My wife cooks for a few customers,
but you have to tell us beforehand,
then it'll be ready for you.
- All right, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Annalisa?
What airline did I fly to Canada with
in March?
United. Thanks.
Goodbye.
Yes, but don't say we have
to help Italian films.
Because I know...
Everyone knows,
it's all we ever think of.
Yes, everyone...
All right.
Know how many weeks it
takes Wenders to shoot a film? Six.
Ma'am!
Gloria!
I was wondering
how Claudia got on today.
Fine, she was calm and attentive.
She has a strong character.
But we have to keep
an eye on her, because...
It doesn't take much
to trigger off...
I know, it doesn't take much.
Don't worry, we're being careful,
and we have your number.
Which are
your classroom windows this year?
Those two on the third floor.
- The middle ones.
- Those two?
Look outside, darling, now.
Look out of the window. Claudia.
Look out.
I don't think anyone's there...
We usually take them
to the playground after lunch.
- I'll be going then. Don't worry.
- Goodbye.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
I could take Claudia home
and bring her back later.
Let's see what they want to do.
I can take her to the gym too,
you only have to call.
I said I can take her
to the gym...
It's kind of you, Annamaria,
but we'll see...
maybe they're coming out...
No, they're the younger kids.
Give me a kiss.
- How did it go?
- Fine.
- Are you tired?
- No.
- Hello, Benedetta. Nice blouse.
- Thanks.
- You only have to ask.
- Yes, okay.
Benedetta's Mommy's
called Annamaria, right?
Maria Grazia.
I've forgotten everything.
Be careful!
"And the answer is...
Pizzano Pizza's secret mission
consisted of not telling anyone
he was on a secret mission.
And now I bet you're asking:
'How come you've told us now
and not before?
What's changed?"
"Rats live on no evil star".
- "And this is a good..."
- Rats live on no evil star.
What's that?
What's so funny?
- What's all this about rats?
- Do you give up?
Yes, I give up.
It's a palindrome.
"Rats live on no evil star".
Get it?
You can read it back-to-front.
- How do you know about palindromes?
- It's reversible.
The teacher explained
that some things are reversible...
and others are irreversible.
"Sator..."
I know one too.
"Sator arepo tenet opera rotas".
But yours doesn't make sense.
Yes, it does, it's Latin!
It means...
It means...
The sower...
holds, lifts...
...the wheel...
...with care, with great care!
"And that, children,
is a good question, so good..."
How's that lady
whose life you saved?
How do you know about that?
I know.
I think she's okay...
"It's such a good question...
that it's perfect
for ending the first chapter with."
- Bye, Daddy!
- Claudia!
Listen...
I really did wait outside
all day yesterday.
- Really?
- Yes.
And I'll stay here
until you come out today.
So look out of the window
at break, then we can wave.
- What if it rains?
- If it rains...
I'll stay in the car, I might be able
to see you from there too.
Bye.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
They blamed him
for taking the Gormiti cards.
There's no harm in that.
He'll only play with them.
But, Rosaria...
My son brings things home
sometimes too.
- He plays with them...
- His mother says it wasn't him.
List of the homes I've lived in.
Viale Bruno Buozzi. 341.
fifth floor.
Via Chiana. 22.
Viale Giotto. 14. Second floor.
Via Valla, 37. Top floor.
Via San Tommaso d'Aquino.
Then Via Chiana again,
Piazz a Crati...
and after Piazz a Crati. Via Miani.
then Via delle Isole...
No. Via delle Isole...
that was my first home with Lara.
That's enough!
That's enough, I can't bear it.
End of the list.
- Which little boy?
- Guido.
- The one...
- The chubby one.
- What has he done?
- He took the Gormiti cards...
He stole the Gormiti cards
from school, but...
We're making too much
of a fuss about it...
- Benedetta would never do that.
- No! No?
Would Claudia?
Hello!
- How are things?
- So-so.
Here I am.
- It's nice here.
- Yes, it's nice.
- This is the school then?
- Yes, and this is...
Those are Claudia's windows...
The two middle ones.
There she is. Claudia!
Jean-Claude!
Hello!
Come on.
- How is she?
- Fine.
That is... I don't really know.
She seems fine.
Pietro,
they've taken the plane off me.
I can't use
the company plane any more.
Why did they do that?
It's called "spending cuts".
But you know what that means.
It means it's all over.
All over? Come on!
- Know who signed the resolution?
- Thierry.
- Yes.
- He had to sign it, didn't he?
No, Thierry has betrayed me.
He's gone over to Boesson's side.
- Thierry's against this merger!
- He was, not any more.
Listen, last year during
the Venice Film Festival,
he called me from Paris
saying we needed to talk.
He was on his way
and I was to tell no one.
The merger... out of the question.
What merger?
I didn't know about it.
How could I imagine Boesson
was joining forces with Steiner,
his greatest enemy?
And know what I was thinking?
That I was happy.
That I was making a pact
with my best friend.
The world is full of top managers
having dinner together,
but they're not people with
a twenty-year friendship like us.
He's a traitor.
The merger: never!
Now do you understand?
How's Francesca?
A little stressed out.
She's always asking about you.
How are your wife and son?
It's a mess. Francesca and Sandrine
can't stand each other.
So I don't get to see Jacques.
It's no use.
It's all over, Pietro. All over.
What do you intend to do?
I'll wait. My way of working
will be not to work.
You do the same.
Wait outside this school.
Stay as long as you can, okay?
Bye.
Ah, cutting out your uncle?
Just think...
What number is he
in the eligible bachelor list?
BOESSON:
AGREEMENT WITH STEINER CLOSE
How do you get glue off?
I don't know, it's glue.
What have you done?
- Nothing, a bit of...
- A bit?
Let's see...
27, 26...
23, 24...
You've glued all September together!
- Where will you note your homework?
- In my exercise-book.
Then why did we bother
buying a diary?
To stick pictures into.
It's your diary...
Daddy's a fool...
- Stop honking your horn, you idiot!
- Get out of the way!
Get a move on!
Wait!
Do we have to wait all day?
Hurry up!
Well?
Idiot!
I'll drive right over you!
There!
Just look at her!
What's going on?
Bastards!
I can't stay here all day!
- Wait!
- I'll be late for work!
Wait a minute.
You'll have to wait anyway.
- Marta...
- What do they want?
They don't want anything.
Move out of the way.
- What do you all want?
- Get stuffed!
- Marta, calm down.
- Can you tell?
- Tell what?
- They'll take the part off me.
- Cover yourself up.
- I'll lose my job!
Everyone's staring at you.
- What are we talking about?
- I'm pregnant!
You're pregnant... by whom?
The stage designer, he's younger
than me, and married with a kid.
- What will you do?
- We'll do nothing.
We've stopped seeing each other.
I'm not going to tell him
I'm pregnant.
We debut in two months' time.
I'm sure you can't tell.
You're the only person who knows.
I didn't even tell Lara.
I didn't have time.
- Who the fuck is she?
- Who?
A girl with a dog, I don't know...
- Is she pretty?
- Yes, she's pretty.
Prettier than I am?
- I wouldn't know, she...
- Prettier than I am?
- No, she's not prettier than you.
- Good.
Hug me.
I don't want to end up
like my sister. I want to be loved!
Besides Claudia,
you're all she had, Pietro.
And you didn't love her.
And maybe Claudia didn't either.
- What's up with you today?
- You said she never cries.
That she falls asleep
as though nothing had happened.
Lara dies and you're not even sad!
What do you know about it? Stop it!
She knew very well
you didn't love her!
She was sick,
I took her to see doctors...
She wasn't sick.
She was the one who took you
to see doctors. You were sick.
- And you're in a worse state today.
- Of course, you never noticed.
- What?
- That she was sick!
Sure, I never noticed
my wife was sick...
I only lived with her for 12 years,
but I never realised...
And our daughter
didn't love her either...
- Daddy!
- And what's more, not even...
Hello, sweetie!
- I didn't love her either, eh?
- Auntie Marta!
No one loved Lara.
- Bye, Marta.
- No.
Wait!
Know what the last thing
Lara and I did together was?
- No, I don't.
- We went to a fortune-teller.
When?
When you took the kids
to the waterpark.
She dealt out our cards...
But she didn't want
to read Lara's.
But Lara insisted.
And the fortune-teller told her
she would die, without a man...
the way she'd always been.
Now she's saying Lara went
to see a fortune-teller!
That too.
Lara having her cards read!
Go on, Claudia!
No. Do it again.
Keep your feet together...
Tighten your buttocks...
Good girl...
- Let's see what Rheja's cooked.
- I'm not eating any more flans.
Not eating...
We'll heat it a bit more.
- What is it?
- It smells nice, I couldn't tell.
- It's a flan.
- It's not really a flan.
What a pain in the ass.
Claudia!
What do I tell him then?
What do you want him to make?
Chicken and potatoes.
Listen "chicken and potatoes",
next time I come to the gym,
I'm bringing a videocamera.
- I'll film you...
- What?
You're not bringing
a videocamera to the gym.
It's only so you'll see
you're good.
That woman's obsessed
with your hips.
- It's not true...
- Gaia's right.
She says I'm good at the splits,
with the instep...
But I'm still not perfect
at the handstand.
- What do you mean by perfect?
- In the absolute sense.
A list of the things
I don't know about Lara.
She went to see a fortune-teller
because she was sick.
She had a lot of money
in her current account.
She always told everything
to her sister.
She'd booked an appointment
with a plastic surgeon...
perhaps she wanted a nose job.
Or perhaps it was
a nose job for me.
I don't know whether she too
thought Claudia's handstand
wasn't perfect.
She had more shoes
than I thought.
She had a subscription to
"ltalian Recipes"...
She lived in Ravenna for two months
after leaving school
with her friend Daniela.
She had just started reading
Bret Easton Ellis's latest book.
She had coffee with
the other mothers every morning.
And she exchanged e-mails
with this "Gianni dot Orz an"
who just happens to be the guy who
writes the stories Claudia loves.
And now I am about to read
what the fuck they wrote.
Daddy!
What is it, darling?
Did you have a bad dream?
- Where were you going?
- When?
- Before.
- When you called me?
- Yes, where were you going?
- Nowhere.
It was just a bad dream.
Go back to sleep.
It didn't feel like a dream.
Because bad dreams
never feel like dreams.
You'll have forgotten it by tomorrow.
Good night.
Daddy...
Know what the thing that shocked me
most in my whole life was?
When I found out my grandma
was also your mommy.

PARENTS-TOGETHER MEETING
"DETACHMENT AND SEPARATION"
Well done, you're right to stay here.
- Samuele!
- Stick by her.
- Have you heard?
- What?
Jean-Claude is out.
- Did you know?
- Yes.
- How long have you known?
- A couple of weeks.
A couple of weeks?
He only resigned yesterday.
- What do you mean, he resigned?
- He's walked out.
What do you think?
I don't know. We'll have to wait
and see what happens...
I've written this paper, here.
You can read it later.
You're not doing anything.
- I've written everything I know.
- You're the personnel manager.
I explain what a merger means
to the employees.
Listen to the beginning.
"A merger is a good thing
for shareholders,
but not for the human beings
who suffer the worst work trauma
that can be inflicted on them."
Understand? Human beings!
You have to read it all.
It talks about the human factor,
the psychology...
The devastating effect
it has on the age group...
on the 40 to 50 age group,
which is the group
that effects us directly.
The last bit at least...
Read it now.
Here it is.
The last few lines.
- Shall I?
- No, I'll read it.
"It is a particularly
destabilising situation
which only three categories
are able to bear,
the faithful, the traitors
and the collaborationists."
- Now you read it.
- I'll read it...
"That's why there has never been
a single merger that hasn't failed,
Holy fucking Mary...
...in the first two years."
What's this? You're not
handing it in like that?
- I already have.
- And you said that?
Can you imagine?
I'm a Catholic, you know?
My brother
is a missionary in Africa.
I've never blasphemed in my life!
He's a big dog!
- Fog!
- Nice name.
I'm sorry, but he always runs off
if I let go of his lead.
- Hello.
- Come on!
- Pretty girl, who is she?
- I don't know her.
- You said hello though.
- Yes.
- It's Thierry.
- Don't answer it, come on.
Hello, Thierry!
- Did you hear about Jean-Claude?
- I hear you took the plane off him.
Yes, and do you know why?
Spending cuts, I believe.
He gave his notice in yesterday.
I will manage Italy
until the merger, but then...
we have to find a new chairman.
I came to ask if you feel like
taking over Jean-Claude's job.
- Me? Jean-Claude's job?
- Yes.
- Do you like it?
- Yes, but what cheese is this?
Pecorino.
I've spoken to Boesson,
he agreed.
I don't need an answer now,
take your time.
No, I'm not going to,
because Jean-Claude didn't resign,
you got rid of him.
And he's my friend,
I can't do this to him. Okay?
Mario?
Ask your friend if they eat
these things in Paris...
I don't know, but why
did you put cheese on it?
The broccoli wouldn't
taste of anything otherwise.
What?
Broccoli should taste like broccoli!
You're insecure, you worry too much
and put too much stuff in it.
- You know me too well.
- It's got everything in it!
Do you know what Jean-Claude did?
No.
He stole, Pietro.
He lied and he stole.
And he did it to me.
You say you're his friend,
I'd been his friend for 20 years!
- He took advantage and stole.
- Stop it!
He's stolen a lot of money.
He forged the balance sheets.
- I found out and he threatened me.
- I don't believe it!
Because you're honest
and these things...
I don't believe it
because Jean-Claude is my friend.
So just stop it!
- Don't miss this opportunity.
- This opportunity...
If I'm here
instead of being in the office,
it's because I don't give
a damn about the merger.
I may be wrong,
but I don't give a damn.
That's my daughter's school...
And I want to be near her.
The end!
I understand how you feel.
Don't give me your answer yet.
In a month or two
you'll feel differently.
You'll get your enthusiasm back.
We can wait.
You're the right man for the job.
Why did you resign?
- Why did you resign?
- Because...
I didn't want to give him
the satisfaction of firing me.
- What will you do now?
- I'll spend more time with my son.
If Sandrine doesn't bust my balls.
And Francesca and I
want to go to the mountains.
- We have a villa at Courmayeur.
- A villa!
You bought it?
It cost so much I'm almost
ashamed to admit it. But it's lovely.
What did you want
to talk to me about?
Nothing, I heard
you'd resigned, so...
Dinner's ready!
I'm sorry for keeping
you waiting so long.
Can you shove it up your ass,
please?
- What was that?
- Can you dish it out, please?
Let's go to the table, Claudia.
Here we are!
Nothing fancy.
Do you like it?
- What's wrong?
- Pietro, please...
Can you repeat
what Francesca said?
What did I say?
You said I could shove it up
my you-know-where.
- You are joking?
- No! I'm not joking.
- Did she say that or didn't she?
- She said...
- Are you teasing me?
- She sort of said it.
Are they teasing me?
I don't know!
Tell me!
Leave Claudia alone!
Pietro, tell her...
Enjoy your meal, Jean-Claude.
Francesca, enjoy your meal...
You're right. Nothing fancy, but...
It's good. Everything's fine.
And maybe you...
...should discuss these things
when we have gone.
Eat up, come on.
Good evening. Paladini.
Show us to the table, we're late.
Here.
Hello, everything okay?
Good evening, sorry we're late,
but there was a lot of traffic.
- Carlo!
- We know, we know!
- I'm sorry I'm not a fan of yours.
- Why's that?
Your jeans
arrived too late for me.
That's not true,
perhaps you don't know, but...
I can appreciate them anyway.
Your success is well-deserved,
believe me.
Success!
By the way, your brother's
becoming more famous than you!
Yes, my brother
is very good at his job.
In what way?
The Paladini outside the school,
he's your brother, right?
Paladini, the one at the school?
It's such a moving story...
- What's this?
- What are you doing here?
- Who told you I was here?
- Hi.
You must be very proud
of him, right?
Of course.
- How's his little girl?
- How did her mother die exactly?
She was alone when it happened,
her husband wasn't there.
It happened at Roccamare, you know.
Their villa's next to yours.
I was about to say
I didn't want to talk about Lara,
then I thought I would shock them!
And I told them
what happened during the rescue.
Why don't you keep
your mouth shut sometimes, Carlo?
Pietro and I jumped in
because no one was moving.
We were wasting time!
Then this shit, sorry, said:
"Don't go, it's dangerous!"
It didn't look dangerous,
so we jumped in.
When we realised the women
had got separated...
- There was a girl in front of me...
- I'm not with you...
There was a girl, an elegant blonde
in a cream-coloured dress...
who was listening
very attentively.
But we succeeded.
You won't believe it,
but no one noticed.
As though we hadn't done anything!
Strange, isn't it?
Eleonora!
What's wrong, darling?
Her name's Eleonora Simoncini,
an elegant, beautiful woman...
She owns Brick Chocolate.
Remember that ad with
the rabbit eating chocolate carrots?
Brick is one of the groups
involved in our merger.
- Steiner's?
- Yes, how did you know?
- It's in all the papers!
- In the sports paper too?
She has shares in the company.
They were talking about it.
She calmed down...
She sat next to me and asked me
a load of questions.
She wanted to know how you were.
She asked me to thank you. Hey...
She brings her dog here
every morning.
Called Fog... the dog is, I mean.
We only say hi,
we don't know each other.
- But you have...
- She's pretty, and she knows it.
- And she wears Weirdo jeans.
- I've never noticed.
- That's bad!
- Okay, it's bad!
Does it annoy you that...
It annoys me that people I don't even
know are talking about me!
Yes, but you camp out on a bench
like a madman, distraught...
- I'm not distraught!
- It's normal to be upset...
- I'm not upset!
- Don't take that attitude.
- Carlo, I'm not suffering.
- Then what are you doing here?
I like it here.
You like sitting on a bench
outside a school all day?
I don't sit here all day,
I move about.
- I don't understand you.
- Who cares!
It's not good for Claudia
to see her father like this.
I'm worried about you.
You've told me, all right?
Are you eating at the café with me?
The food's not bad,
but if you're busy...
- It's just that I've got...
- A press conference!
I'm taking Claudia out for dinner
tonight, I promised her.
- If you want to come...
- No!
She'd rather go on her own...
with you. She adores you.
Know what she wrote in an essay?
"My uncle's an elusive hero!"
- Does she like Japanese food?
- She will if you take her.
But be careful.
I'm not sure she's ready...
to talk about certain things.
Even if she seems normal.
She never looks sad.
She's always calm and composed.
Like you.
This equilibrium is very fragile,
so you have to...
I'm an elusive hero,
I'll behave like an elusive hero.
All right.
Bye.
Take the next road on the right.
You're at your destination.
Thank you.
Good evening.
My name's Manuela Solvey Grassetti.
I'm a psychotherapist.
Before I start,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
How did the need to discuss
this subject come about?
It was a spontaneous thing.
Because many of us found ourselves
discussing death with our children.
When we talk about death,
we usually refer to someone's death.
Our own death, our loved ones...
The dead soldiers
the children see on TV.
- Can you all hear me?
- Yes.
I would like you to think about
a very simple but fundamental fact.
We transfer our emotions
onto our children.
Until a certain age,
what they feel
is a repetition
of what we parents feel.
Not what
we make an effort to show them,
but what our real feelings are.
My brother said it...
This woman has just said it.
If Claudia's not suffering perhaps
it's because I'm not suffering enough.
Did I make myself clear?
Good, then let's carry on.
There are only three ways
to experience death...
You're bleeding!
Death itself, emotional death,
and what we see as...
A list of things
I've never been able to look at.
The thousands of glasses
piled up in Auschwitz.
The brushes and combs.
again in Auschwitz.
Car crashes on the motorway.
When they took
Claudia's blood sample.
The green vomit in "The Exorcist".
Lara lying on the ground
surrounded by slices of melon.
What's wrong?
I made a fucking fool of myself!
List of the places
I will never go back to.
A Parents-together meeting.
And the villa at Roccamare.
Hello.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- She's asleep.
She's asleep.
What the fuck are you doing anyway?
- Want some?
- Some what, Carlo?
Want some what? You're a junkie!
What a pain, the same old sermon!
Okay, I'm a junkie.
But have a drag, go on.
- You're a junkie, Carlo!
- Go on!
Take that pipe away!
I almost fainted...
I did faint, actually.
- Where?
- In front of thirty people.
You see, you do need to relax.
Have a drag, trust me.
- What do I do?
- Take a drag.
- It won't have any effect anyway.
- Just wait till it kicks in.
What's so funny? Listen to you.
"When it kicks in"!
Come on, "let's kick in"...
Breathe in, if you blow...
You see.
- What can you feel?
- What is it?
- Opium, what can you feel?
- Opium?
- What can you feel?
- Nothing!
- Because you're not doing it right.
- I breathe in like this.
You're not doing it right.
These stories aren't bad,
I read them to Claudia.
Then when she fell asleep,
I carried on reading them...
Gianni Orzan.
Gianni Orzan
wrote letters to my wife.
You see, it has kicked in.
Have another drag.
Don't laugh!
Gianni Orzan wrote...
letters to my wife, to Lara!
- Who, this guy here?
- What's so funny?
"Gianni Orzan lives in Rome
where he teaches romance philosophy."
Romance philology... ignorant!
There were at least 3 e-mails on
her computer, maybe even 300.
- What did he say?
- I don't know.
- What?
- I didn't read them, because...
Why?
All gone. I deleted them all.
- At a certain point...
- I would have read them.
- You always do what is right.
- Yes, like what?
Remember when you
used to take me to the park...
You remember!
I don't feel like it, don't!
Do you remember...
You miss Lara.
You miss Lara.
I miss you.
Do you really?
And it's not true
I like these stories. They're awful.
You know what?
What's this guy's name?
- Gianni Orzan, go fuck yourself!
- Fuck off!
Gianni Orzan, fuck off!
It's not kicking in...
It is kicking in, it is.
- It's not kicking in, Carlo.
- It is kicking in.
It's got a videocamera,
like Uncle Carlo's.
It's a rich person's phone,
do you want to see it?
No, not now,
and you're not taking it to school.
- I know.
- Good morning.
- Hello, Uncle.
- Good morning.
Claudia, go and get your school-bag
or we'll be late.
And listen...
When you buy a present
for a young child...
you should ask the parents
if they agree first.
- Since when?
- Since now.
Right from the moment
I'm saying it.
Didn't you wonder
why Claudia didn't have a mobile?
I see you've come round,
you're back to normal.
Sort of, yes.
Next time I'll take you
to the Indian restaurant.
And don't overdo it
with this technical gadget,
it might spoil you.
How sweet! Claudia
and her uncle, they're so nice!
What is it?
I was wrong yesterday,
you're doing the right thing.
Stick it out.
Sir!
Yes...
Yes, I'm listening...
Sir!
- Me?
- Yes.
Tomato and basil, I'm cooking
some pasta, fancy some?
- It's delicious.
- I'm pleased to hear it.
- I don't cook myself.
- Neither did I until last year.
My poor Teresa used to.
- She passed away two years ago.
- I'm sorry.
I spent a whole year
sweeping the flat like a madman!
Five or six times a day.
Sweeping and sweeping...
No...
- What is it?
- It's a game...
It's a game I play every day
with a young boy.
There we go!
Marta, I'm up here!
- Wait for me, I'll be right down.
- If you have to go...
It's my sister-in-law...
I'll finish this first.
- You've got a blood-stain here.
- No, it's sauce, because...
We were eating spaghetti...
- What are you doing?
- Keep still, I'll clean it off!
How disgusting, with spit!
- Are you still in love with me?
- Stop it, Marta!
I've made a mess.
I think Lara thought you were.
- She knew it was a one-night stand.
- Two nights.
- We were drunk the second time.
- Yeah, drunk.
- It needs some water.
- I was drunk.
- No, look, leave it alone.
- Don't worry, I have some.
I do worry with you...
And Lara and I often
had a good laugh about it...
Well done!
There was nothing to laugh about.
It was two years
before I even met her.
Why do we have to talk about it?
I don't want to.
You loved me
but you were scared of me.
It'll soon dry in this heat.
- Leave it.
- Are you angry?
Wouldn't you be?
What are you doing here?
I thought of something,
and I've come to tell you.
- What is it?
- I think you should see a doctor.
I'm the one who should see
a doctor? What's that?
A friend gave it to me.
He's a Freudian...
A Jungian... No, Freudian,
serious, traditional...
Just right for me. Open your bag,
we'll put the Freudian back inside.
Let's try something else then.
We'll go to a friend who does
Rolfing, works with chakras...
- Or to the fortune-teller.
- If you feel up to it...
- You're crazy!
- No, Pietro.
- I'm sorry, but that's not so.
- What isn't?
You think I'm the crazy one?
Okay, to prove you're right,
I'll do one of your stripteases
right here,
when you turn up here
and show everyone your boobs.
- Okay?
- You shit!
- Let go...
- I was joking.
You don't know me at all,
and you didn't know Lara.
That's enough!
I'll do anything you want.
Rolfing...
...chakras, all the doctors...
but leave Lara out of this,
don't mention her again.
- Then promise me something.
- What?
You and Claudia
come to Roccamare with me.
- I'm not going back there.
- Let's go, for the kids' sakes.
I'm sure
it's the right thing to do.
I'm not, I don't know, we'll see.
- No, promise me.
- I'll have to think about it.
- Promise?
- No.
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry.
Forget it.
Let's seat.
I want to ask you
an important question.
What exactly happened when you
and your brother jumped in the sea?
- We swam out to you.
- Yes, but before that.
No one said anything,
you just jumped in?
Of course,
we just jumped in, why?
Your brother said
a man tried to stop you.
He was an idiot,
he looked scared.
And he told us
we'd never manage it.
- Never! So we...
- Is this him, the idiot?
Carlo and I...
Just say yes or no.
Yes, that's him.
Fine.
Thanks.
- Jean-Claude, hello there!
- Hello.
What was Mrs Simoncini doing here?
What do you know
about Eleonora Simoncini?
What everyone knows,
she's Steiner's mistress.
- Steiner's mistress?
- So they say.
"So they say", "Everyone knows"!
"It seems that"...
Don't start that, Jean-Claude.
- You're turning into a mystery man.
- A mystery man?
- A little, yes.
- Let's go to the café.
You serve faggot-size
portions in this restaurant.
- What?
- That's what the owner said.
And she: "My compliments
on the delicious vegetable pie".
In the same tone of voice.
I've written them all down.
"Madam, you shouldn't wear sandals
because you have ugly feet."
"I'll burst if I don't have a piss".
"When I lost my virginity
at 15..."
And the best one...
"It seems black men's cocks...
...aren't any bigger than those
of white men, you know?"
- Know who she said that to?
- No.
- The Senegalese Consul.
- I didn't need to hear that.
I've written it all down as
I promised not to mention it again.
Or she's threatened to leave me,
and I know she will.
Come on... Shall I pay later?
All right.
Because she's sick, Pietro.
And she'll have to get treatment.
Then she'll need everything
I've written down here.
I have to go, I promised her
we'd have lunch together.
Thanks for your advice.
I didn't give you any advice.
Did you go to the Parents-together
meeting the other day?
No, because my brother
came to see us.
- The one from Weirdo Jeans?
- Yes.
When you see him next,
tell him he's my hero.
- Thank goodness...
- See?
My husband teases me,
says I act like a teenager. So what?
On your own now.
I've always liked fashion.
If she doesn't look my way first,
she'll get it wrong.
If she doesn't look my way first,
I'll always be jealous of Carlo.
If she doesn't look my way
before she jumps...
then it's true
I'm not doing anything to help her.
Now!
Well done, but don't look at Daddy
before you jump, look at him afterwards.
Technically it's wrong to say
you win a merger,
because it is a merger.
But both Boesson and Steiner
want to win it, not do it.
But Boesson and Thierry
are convinced we're going to win it.
Whereas I know
it will be suicide.
- How did you work that out?
- Look at the model they chose.
Try looking at it
from a religious point of view.
- Religious?
- Yes.
Boesson's a Catholic,
Steiner's Jewish.
Which model do you think they chose
for the job positions?
The Jewish one,
not the Catholic one.
Boesson's fucked it up!
Even if he's got
the best job, he'll lose.
He should have chosen
the Catholic model in order to win.
- And what's that?
- The Holy Trinity!
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
Boesson chose
the highest position of all,
the solitary God of the Jews.
But he should have planned
three seats at the same level.
One for the Father, one for the Son
and the other for the Holy Spirit.
- I'm not with you.
- Steiner's 70, with three by-passes.
He's a womaniser.
Boesson's a sportsman,
bursting with health, aged 50...
He only had to sit next to him.
Steiner would not
have bothered him.
- All Boesson needed to do was wait.
- The Trinity!
And who's the third guy?
We all know
what happened to the Son!
- Yes, but who is the Son?
- How do I know!
- What?
- You have to tell someone.
- Tell Thierry!
- Tell him what?
I didn't understand
a word of what you said!
- And what's this?
- My resignation.
- Resignation? Did you post it off?
- No, I will tonight.
- Talk to someone about it first.
- Who?
I'm the one people usually
talk to when they resign!
I'm leaving for Zimbabwe
on Friday morning.
I should reach my brother's mission
by Monday.
A village on the Zambian border.
With floods six months of the year,
and no drinking water.
I want to buy a water truck
with my settlement pay.
Bye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Listen, driver, I have decided
to go to the beach, take me there.
As you wish, countess, to the beach!
No, Daddy, I'm not a countess,
I'm Britney Spears.
Uncle Carlo says she has two drivers
and five make-up artists.
Five make-up artists! Look!
Hello, little one, you look pretty.
- I've got a problem.
- What's up?
We can't come.
You are joking, aren't you?
No, trust me.
I'll join you there tomorrow maybe.
What do you mean, trust you?
What must I do with you?
I'm sorry, but I've only
just found out.
- Found out what?
- The set designer's in Rome.
It's the opening
of one of his shows.
I'm sure
he'll have brought his wife.
- I really have to be there.
- What for?
What do you mean?
I want him to see me.
I'll sit near them, he'll
have to introduce his wife.
I'll turn round during the show...
and start staring at him,
I'll stare...
until it pisses her off.
She gets pissed off, then what?
You told me I have to think
of this baby's future.
I didn't mean like this though...
I have to stand up
to that piece of shit!
So you want to cause havoc
by dragging his wife into it?
Why am I
wasting my time on you?
It was your idea
to go to Roccamare
and face up to the trauma.
And now you've abandoned us!
I can see it already.
I really do have to go.
Marta, you really are...
I don't know what you are.
I don't know.
There, the trip
to Roccamare's off.
Why?
Because your aunt can't come,
or rather, she doesn't want to.
Where do you want to go then?
Can't we go on our own?
- You want to go anyway?
- Yes.
This one...
And this one.
Wait, darling.
I'll see to that, don't worry.
- Are you tired?
- A little.
Wait.
Is it Auntie Marta?
No, it's not her.
It's cold in the house, isn't it?
The heating isn't working.
I'll check the boiler, okay?
I'll be right back.
Here we are.
What's that?
It's for tonight,
Benedetta lent it me.
She says it's a witch's costume.
But it's too big.
It's too big?
We'll call Uncle Carlo
and ask him what to do.
It's a bit thin, you'll be cold.
The heating's only just gone on.
- It didn't work last year either.
- Yes, we'll have to change it.
Perhaps we'll change everything,
we'll buy a new house.
What do you say we buy a villa?
- With a pool maybe?
- Yes.
I've been offered
a very important job.
I could earn more money,
a lot more money!
- Because of that thing you told me?
- Yes, the merger...
In short, our company
and a big American group...
are getting together and
I'd be the chairman in Italy.
- Would you have a chauffeur too?
- Yes, and we'd also have...
Five make-up artists,
like that girl...
What do you think?
It's only a proposal,
I haven't decided yet, okay?
- Shall I say yes or no?
- Yes.
I don't know.
Bye.
Good evening!
I see you've had fun!
Hold it there, you're not
coming in with those shoes!
Look at all this stuff!
- I want some too. What's this?
- A pumpkin worm!
A pumpkin worm...
A pumpkin worm!
Straight to bed then,
and without a shower.
- Can I sleep with you?
- Yes.
- Will you read me a story?
- I've no book.
- I told you to bring it.
- I forgot.
That's enough of Orzan.
I'll think up a story tonight.
- Okay, I was tired anyway.
- Nice faith you have in Daddy!
Come over.
Did I make too much noise?
I told you
there was no need to come.
I wanted to see you.
What a mess! Did you have a party?
Do you want to sleep...
No, let's make coffee.
I've brought cream croissants!
Look what I've brought Claudia!
- Who's this?
- Britney Spears.
- This is her!
- Look what it says...
- Original, eh?
- She'll be so happy.
I don't like the idea
of you being here alone.
- I really don't.
- It's only a couple of days.
- Uncle Carlo!
- Here she is!
Look, I've got a surprise for you.
- Britney!
- Yeah!
Doctor, you'll never guess
who's coming.
Oh God!
He's already here.
- Mr. Paladini?
- Yes.
- Steiner. Nice to meet you.
- I know who you are. Good morning.
- My condolences.
- Thank you.
- I've heard a lot about you.
- From whom?
Steiner's your friend, right?
Ah, good morning.
- Never met him before.
- Why did he come?
I don't really know,
we chatted a bit.
He told me stuff that had
nothing to do with the merger.
One of the world's top capitalists
came here
and sat in the car with you.
You talked,
but didn't mention the merger.
- Isn't that a bit odd?
- Yes, it's odd.
If you tell me what he said,
maybe we'd understand.
- I don't think so.
- Don't you want to tell me?
It's personal.
Listen, Pietro.
Steiner and I will sign
an agreement later.
It states that I'll be president
and he'll be deputy.
I don't know why he's accepted
to be vice-president.
You know it's crucial for me
to know what Steiner
can say or do.
All right...
Steiner made a jealous scene.
Don't kid around.
Well then, I'll tell you why
he's accepted this agreement.
Go on.
He's left you alone, isolated you.
You have to imagine
the Catholic Trinity.
This way, you'll leave
the presidency to him.
- The Trinity?
- Yes.
- And you'd be the third man?
- No!
Steiner told you this?
Listen, Pietro, you're one of us.
Enjoy our trust.
We'd have given you
Jean-Claude's position,
I can consider
this new candidacy.
- What candidacy?
- It doesn't work like that.
If you want me to trust you,
tell me what he said.
I don't want Jean-Claude's position.
I don't want you coming here
telling me your business
and making me offers.
I want to stay here
and be left in peace.
Bye.
Dad!
- Look!
- What is it?
Wake up! Look!
Wait.
- What is it?
- Look.
- Nice.
- It might keep up till Christmas!
It'll be a great Christmas,
I promise.
- What would you like?
- I don't know yet.
I want to get you a big present.
Isn't there something
you'd really like?
I don't know.
- I'll think about it.
- Okay, think about it.
Go and get dressed.
Careful!
Fog! Stop him!
Come here!
Stop him!
Come here!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I'm Jolanda. You?
Pietro.
- Anyway, we know each other...
- Yes.
Bye.
What is it?
- I thought.
- About what?
My present. Remember I told you
about my teacher on the first day?
The first day? Can't remember.
Rats live on no evil star.
Reversibility.
- Remember?
- Reversibility... yes.
She told us about it
and you started waiting here.
I thought the two things
were linked.
A nice thing happens
then it doesn't happen again.
Because it's irreversible.
You can't stay here forever, right?
Right.
I thought you'd tell me
you had to go back to the office.
I was happy
that you never told me.
- It's just that...
- Just that...
My friends have started
to make fun of me.
You know what kids are like...
cruel.
- The teachers haven't said anything.
- They don't know.
When I say hi through the window,
they laugh at me.
- Who?
- Lucilla, Beatrice...
- Everyone, even the boys.
- Benedetta too?
I saw her laugh once.
- The present I'd like from you...
- I get it, don't go on.
- Are you upset?
- No.
I couldn't stay here all year.
You were right to tell me.
- I should've kept quiet.
- No, you were right.
You always have to speak up.
Always... remember that.
Bye, sweetie.
Go on, go.
