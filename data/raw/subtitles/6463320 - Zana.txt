More pills?
Everything's fine. She is healthy.
All fine? It's been years and nothing.
Well, it's a good sign that...
...she had a healthy pregnancy once.
But...
Maybe it's stress. In her situation...
Have you considered a psychiatrist?
Are you joking?
We don't have crazies in our family!
What am I paying you for?
Best doctor in Peja? Seriously!
Forgive my mother-in-law, she is just...
Let's go!
It'll happen.
- Exactly. Everything is working.
Just keep taking the pills and...
You know... with your husband...
Wake up. Breakfast is ready.
Okay, five more minutes.
Move your legs!
Sit like a normal person.
And leave the phone alone!
Give me some bread.
You didn't mix the yogurt with water?
- No, I just made it. It's fresh.
Bring me some Fanta then.
I don't like thick yogurt.
You want it?
- Leave it here.
Is it hot?
- Yes, sweetheart.
Perfect. The other layers were overcooked.
You won't see me making flia anymore.
YouTube saved me. You have no idea
how many recipes I get on there.
The kids and Vedat love it.
- Yeah?
Look at him! This year,
he didn't even help with the garden.
Look how he squats.
The fountain he put in his yard...
to die for.
Where'd he get the money? His store?
He is a hard worker.
- What work?
It looks very good.
I see a road ahead of you.
You will receive money
but also spend some for a good cause.
Hopefully, but I doubt it.
In the middle of the house,
I see a ring. Marriage.
A ring?
- A very clear ring.
Put that thing away!
Come, Uncle!
- Right on time.
I brought cold beers!
- You know too well, Dad.
Why did you give him money
to buy beer again?
He's my dad.
- May the devil eat your dad.
Look how he walks. He's about to fall.
- What's up with you?
Let a snake drink it from his stomach!
Will you shut your mouth,
or do I need to come over there?!
Leave it, Uncle.
Did I ever tell you about my cousin?
He was married five years,
but they didn't have kids.
Then he took a second wife,
and both of them got pregnant.
He is tiny.
His hands are smaller than mine.
How does he manage with two?
- I've heard he sleeps one week with one...
...and next week with the other.
Glad I am not in his skin.
How are things with you and Ilir?
I'm just asking.
We're fine.
We should visit a healer.
The doctors aren't helping.
Maybe someone put a curse on us.
And who would want
to put a curse on us?
There are evil people out there.
You saw how Adam's son, Besi,
was last year with the seizures.
If it wasn't for the healers,
he might not even be alive.
Those are just stories. Old wives' tales.
I'm serious. It's all in your head.
Lume. Hey. Wake up.
Shhh. Lume. It's me. Wake up.
Are you well? - Yes.
- Mother, wife? - All well.
- You? - I am well.
- Good to hear.
- Are you well? - Yes.
- Family? - All well.
- Your mother, father? Family?
- All well.
- Are you well? - Yes, well.
- Family? - All well.
- Are you tired?
- Yes, but not too bad.
Should I make black tea?
- Yes. Make it.
Can I come help you?
- Come.
Are you stupid?
You don't see what's happening?
What are you saying?
Gjeva brought Mahije over
so Ilir could see her.
Turn around! Don't look!
- Why to see Ilir?
Mahije was married, but her husband
was beating her, so she left him.
Now, nobody will take her.
Just older men.
Pass me the sugar.
No, thank you.
Do you want coffee?
- Nothing for me, thank you.
Maybe a juice?
- Nothing, thank you.
Maybe there's still Fanta.
I want Fanta. Bring me one.
- Auntie Lume will see.
Are you hungry?
- No, we've eaten. Thank you.
Let me do it.
Give it to me.
What's up with you?
This is about the girl who came to visit.
Mother brought her.
She wanted to scare you,
so you'd go see a healer.
Anyway, she wasn't too bad-looking.
You want a wife?
Not here. My mother.
Someone will see us.
Let's go home.
Come on. Don't worry.
Are you Kumria?
- Who sent you?
I brought my daughter-in-law
to get checked.
I can't help her.
Please.
Come inside.
Lume, come on, sweetheart.
The body burns, cools, and is cleansed.
You married very young.
But it was love.
You eloped.
During the war,
you stayed in your village.
We were told they wouldn't harm us.
You suffered a loss.
Your second pregnancy...
I see blood.
You miscarried.
No! There were no miscarriages!
She hasn't been pregnant since the war.
Look again. You got it all wrong.
Maybe I didn't see it correctly.
Drink.
Lume...
What's wrong with you?
It's not poison.
It's okay.
Every drop tells us something.
The child will come when you are all ready.
When you invite it.
We are ready! How do we invite it?
To open the door...
You must make a sacrifice.
Grab it!
It's over there!
Come on, faster!
Grab it!
Bravo! Bravo!
Good job. Give it to me.
Come, Lume.
Don't pay attention to them.
Chop it. Come on.
Come on, Lume.
Hit it!
Back away! You boys go home now!
Hit it!
You eat chicken.
Hey, Lume, did you get healed today
at Kumria's?
Yes, yes. It was very good.
You can kill ten chickens, won't matter.
Is that right? Shame on you.
Go melt some lead.
Melt whatever, it does nothing.
I've heard bad things about that woman.
If she was a good woman,
she'd have married by now.
I heard she makes spells.
- Those are just rumors.
So now you've sent her to a witch.
- I've seen witches with my own eyes.
Coming back from the store one night...
riding my bicycle through the swamp...
I hear this noise behind me.
I turn around, and what do I see?
Two gorgeous women.
We've heard it a hundred times.
You were drunk and followed by dogs.
I am talking to Lume and not you.
They followed me.
I stopped.
They got hold of my bike!
They wanted me to sleep with them.
- That's enough, Dad.
They came right into the house.
I was married to Gjeva then.
You're lucky I married you,
'cause nobody else would have.
You've been a real catch yourself.
- Leave it now, it's boring.
Wasn't it my dad
who sent you to the doctor?
What doctor?
He sent me to a magic healer!
He told me to lie down. I did.
I thought, "What's he gonna do?"
He pinned me down.
Then...
He beat me with a log.
I got dizzy.
Then this cold sensation
went right through me.
What was that?
Who's out there?
It's Trimi.
Trimi? Oh, geez.
Don't touch that boy. You hear me?
Shut your mouth.
- Hey, don't go crazy on him.
Get your butt in here!
Big-headed idiot!
Come on, leave him be.
- Here you go, sit with your mom.
You were a child yourself once.
Little rat.
You were just like him when you were young.
- Even worse.
Ilir, you should send Lume to Dr. Murati.
To who? That guy on TV
who charges 500 euros a visit?
500 euros...
500 euros for some healer to tell us
how to make a baby.
Don't be surprised when Mother brings
a second wife into this house.
Don't you go getting pregnant now.
Lume.
Come on. Go back to bed.
Dear citizens, war veterans, mothers.
Today, we honor the martyrs and heroes
that gave their lives for freedom.
For ten years now, we gather here...
to remember the most bloody day...
of our people.
It is a difficult day.
Not only for the parents and families
of the dead,
but for all of Kosovo.
They didn't die. They are still with us.
Their blood didn't spill in vain.
Glory!
Fallen parents, brothers, and sisters.
The day you died, you were reborn.
Because of you, the sun today is shining!
Even the birds sing free!
Now, we will go to the graves to pay tribute.
Dad.
May Father always hold you.
Don't be sad.
Sadik.
Stay strong, man. Stay strong.
Are you grieving?
- I am grieving.
You hold so well. You are so strong.
What can we do? We have to live.
You are still young. May God bring you
another child. Hopefully a son.
Why don't you come to the graves?
We'll go together.
Okay. Since you are going home,
can you feed my cow?
Are you Lume? Ilir's wife?
Yes.
- Do you remember me?
You came to my brother-in-law's wedding,
Gjevat, before the war.
Yes. I remember. How are you?
Your daughters, husband?
- All well.
Listen, Lume, you know...
there was a VHS tape of the wedding.
You are on the tape.
Your whole family.
I know your photographs were burned
along with your house in the war.
We thought we could make you
a copy of the VHS tape.
I have to get going.
I need to feed the cow.
Lume? Wake up.
Take the Bensedin.
I've inherited this special gift.
I help them travel to another dimension...
...the dimension of the spirits.
The world of the Jinn.
We need to get the money
for you to visit him.
No! I don't want to go! Let go of me!
Let me go!
Don't be afraid. You will be healed.
Good afternoon.
We have come...
We're trying to have a baby.
I know. I know.
Open your hands.
Closer. Don't be afraid.
Good.
Do you see them?
Like shadows.
Spirits.
At night? Dusk?
No.
Not like that. I just have bad dreams.
She wakes up often at night.
To tell you the truth, she scares me.
I can't tell if she is awake or asleep.
She looks scary... like a crazy person.
I see.
Go to the shop next to my building.
Tell them I've sent you.
You will buy some things
which you will need later.
Will they know what things?
- They will know exactly. Please go.
You are possessed.
You're being terrorized by a Jinn.
They're invisible beings that live
in a parallel world with ours.
In a shadow world.
They can transform
into a million different faces.
And they tempt us into doing things
we would never do.
They drive us away from ourselves.
Come.
You think that you are seeing
your daughter.
It is not your daughter.
It's a Jinn in the form of your daughter.
It's not your daughter.
It's a Jinn in the form of your daughter.
She is not your daughter.
It's a Jinn in the form of your daughter!
The body is not important.
You need to make peace with the soul.
The Jinn can and will be beaten.
Did you buy what I asked for?
When you go home,
you will wrap this into an amulet.
She should carry it on her at all times.
I will take care of it,
since it wasn't cheap.
Children are priceless.
Do you smoke?
- Sometimes.
Here.
Thanks.
How are you two doing?
What do you mean?
What do I mean? I mean...
Why? Did she say something?
Don't you see?
Your wife is possessed.
She is not herself.
They try to make her cold towards you.
Destroy the marriage. Destroy her.
You have to do something about it.
You've turned it into a forest.
- Yeah.
Don't tickle me.
No. No.
See that?
That's your baby. Five weeks old.
Didn't I tell you it would work out?
You can't give up.
We will protect it.
The healer will help us.
The healer?
I know you don't believe me, but...
He has lifted a huge weight
from my chest.
He guessed it all right.
Lume.
These people only want
to make money off of you.
No, he's not like that.
Oh, really? He's different?
Can't you just be happy for me?
Lume, Lume.
Hey! In the potatoes?!
Are you coming?
- Where?
Let's play.
- No.
Lume! Come on!
Come on!
Kick it!
Lume! Stop!
You want to have a miscarriage?!
Let her play!
It will do the baby some good!
You grow up! Don't act like a kid!
Leave her alone!
Where are you going?
I'm going to gather the potatoes.
You're not going anywhere
until that baby is born!
Sania?
Is that you?
Lume.
About that cassette...
Good afternoon, Remzije.
How are you?
Is Lume here?
- She is, but she's not feeling well.
Oh?
- She's resting.
Here is the video cassette.
Gjevat brought it from Germany.
Tape? What? Okay, I'll give it to her.
Say hi to her for me.
Hope she gets better soon.
Tell her she can call me anytime.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Bye.
You don't have to do this.
I should be making you coffee.
It's okay. You work all the time
and don't let me lift a finger.
Here.
Mother-in-law...
The tape... I want to watch it.
What tape?
You know.
Gjevat's wedding tape.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I heard you talking to Sania.
No, dear. She just came by
to say they haven't found it yet.
But when they do, she will bring it over.
And remember what the healer said?
We can watch it later, after the birth.
When Sania brings it over.
I'm well now.
You are not well.
You're not thinking straight.
Maybe it was another one
of your dreams.
Come on, Ilir. Let's go.
Why do we still have that?
Where was it?
In my closet.
Why haven't you thrown it away?
I saved it for the Hague.
In case there is a trial.
Hague?
Why didn't you let her watch
the wedding tape?
It's not the right time.
Are you okay?
Where are you going? Hey!
Lume. Where are you going?
Come inside.
Where is Ilir?
Speak to your mother.
What's up with you?
I want to come back home.
You don't know what you're saying.
You are not well.
You have a fever.
Let me bring you an aspirin.
Take it.
You know you can't come back.
You forget what happened last time?
Now with a child...
Let's get you home
before your father comes back.
Get up! Let's go!
Get up!
Lume! Listen to your mom!
Ilir!
Come! Come!
Come out! I need to have
a few words with you.
Welcome, Sadik.
You think you can play games
with my daughter?!
What are you talking about?
You will never, ever leave her at my door.
Not while I am alive.
Do you understand?!
Who said I am leaving her?
What are you...
Get a handle on things.
If you can't keep your wife under control,
go put a shawl on your head.
Come on, Sadik. Don't be that way.
I don't want to mix in your affairs.
I know she's getting older.
If she can't give you any more children...
take another wife!
You have my permission.
I'm not bringing anyone into my home.
Momma said...
What Momma?
Momma said this and that.
Don't lie to me! I know what you are!
You are shady.
I swear, if I see her on my doorstep
like that one more time,
I'll burn your house down.
You took her without my consent.
I would have never given her to you.
Now keep her!
Go on.
What?
What are you looking at?
Leave me alone.
You're getting on my nerves.
You want to put shame on our family?
I'm talking to you!
You are free to marry.
What?
I won't stop you.
What nonsense are you talking?
It's your fault.
Why did you get me pregnant?
What are you saying?
- Why do you keep getting me pregnant?
It's not you speaking.
I am speaking.
- No. The Jinn is speaking for you.
It's not you!
The curse is talking. Don't speak!
Why do you keep getting me pregnant?!
- Don't speak! Don't speak!
Which ones are they?
Give them to me.
Give them to me.
Please.
I'll do it myself!
Where did you put them?
You can't keep doing this.
No! No! Spit it out!
Spit it out!
If you don't want to be pregnant,
keep those legs shut!
This is all your fault.
I will tell everyone
you put a spell on me!
What are you gonna do?
Kill me like you did your own babies?
Get up.
Black magic.
Visits to the witch.
Why, Lume?
Or is Lume not in there at all?
She is possessed.
The demon is inside her.
We have to save the child.
Right, Lume?
Lume?
Lume.
Lume!
Slow down.
- Hold her, Ilir.
Do you want to save your child?
Hold her. This isn't your wife.
Hold her, Ilir.
Ilir.
You want to try to influence him too, huh?
It's not enough
that you've taken over this woman?
Liar!
Get out of her!
It's fine. That's not her.
You liar.
- Who did you make a pact with?
Ilir!
Ilir, let go of me.
I said, let go!
Don't touch me!
Get out of her!
Ilir!
- That's enough!
Let me go!
- Out!
Ilir!
You want some guests?
- Yes. Welcome.
Come on in.
- Hurry up, it's cold.
Good evening.
- You look great tonight.
Hey, beautiful!
Do you have any idea how long it's been
since I've seen you?
Let me see you.
Oh, blessed, how big you've gotten.
Look what I brought you.
Look, it's just your size.
Look at that. It's perfect on you.
I called nonstop about the job.
They wouldn't answer the phone.
Cheers.
You did a big favor, getting Ilir that job.
Of course, he deserves it.
Juice? No, thank you. One more beer.
Why'd you stop it?
- Leave it, for God's sake.
Beautiful and good-looking
All good traits and also charming
Beautiful and good-looking
All good traits and also charming
Lucky you for having a mother
That birthed you without any flaws
Lucky you for having a mother
That birthed you without any flaws
My love with brown eyes
Thinking about you
You've gotten in my head
You are in my blood
Please stay away
Because I am going out of my mind
I warmed them up
'cause they were freezing.
Thanks.
Where did you get this dress?
Shpresa brought it for me.
It's pretty on you.
Never take it off.
That song really brought me back.
I wonder where she found it.
Ilir, you forgot your food.
I got it.
Put this shawl on.
You'll be cold at work.
Come on, Mom.
I'm gonna be indoors anyway.
It's fine. I said it's fine.
Okay.
- Good night.
Lume, you brought me beer?
No. Water.
- What will I do with water?
Drink it! It's good for you.
Ice cold.
Lume?
You were right there.
You didn't see her leave?
What am I to do, guard her all night?
Nobody's saying guard her all night.
Just grab a phone and call me right away.
I did call right away. Don't scream.
- Yeah, right!
It's not your mom's fault, man.
Take it easy.
Is she inside? Tell me!
- There's nobody here! Stop it!
Get out of the way, hag!
- Lume! Lume!
Stop. Stop.
Hey, Ilir.
- Ilir, get back in the car.
