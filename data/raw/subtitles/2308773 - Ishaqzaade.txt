You're a bloody fool! Your
father's father is a bloody fool...
Your father is an ass!
You are an ass, you idiot!
You're the world's
biggest lizard you idiot!
You're a dog! Your father is a dog!
You are a mad dog!
Your mother is a bloody fool,
your father is a bloody fool...
Love rebels...
Love rebels...
These Birds of bedlam, Love rebels
They'll snipe your heart, Love rebels
They're twitching, Love rebels
To take this love apart. Love rebels
Among the lawful,
And the lawless,
Those that were
Among the thousands.
Love rebels,
The Love rebels,
Where are they now?
Love-rebels,
The Love rebels,
Among the stars,
Among the legends,
Those that were
ln poets renditions.
Love-rebels,
The Love rebels,
Where are they now?
Not of the earth, nor of the sky,
lnfinite unto themselves. The Love
- rebels...
Among the lawful,
And the lawless,
Those that were
Among the thousands.
Love-rebels,
The Love rebels,
Where are they now?
Among the stars,
Among the legends,
Those that were found
ln poets renditions.
Love-rebels,
The Love rebels,
Where are they now?
...Chand's body is an atom bomb!
Chand's figure is killing!
Malti
Get me some diesel...ten cans.
The market's not doing too well...
...l don't have ten cans,
there's only one left...
Don't make me thrash you!
lt's his Dadda (granddad's)
birthday party tonight...
...the whole place has to be lit up,
the generator has to run all night...
Are you going to make
Chand Baby dance in the dark?
...they were here earlier...
...they've paid in advance
for ten cans of diesel...
...they'll be back any
minute to pick it up.
Who has paid the advance damn it?!
MLA Qureshi's men. They have
a party tonight as well...
There goes Law and Order!
Party...is it?!
Have you been invited
to do a cabaret?
Dear Lala...you do know that...
Qureshi will remain in power
only for a few more days...
...soon Dadda will win the elections,
so why do you want to mess with me?
Please try and understand Parma sir,
if l give you all the ten cans...
...they'll kill me...why don't
you share amongst yourselves...
Qureshis...
...and Chauhans...share?
Have you gone mad?
Why not share, anything's possible...
Kantilala, it says no smoking!
You take six cans
l'll give them five...
...ok, take seven...eight...
all...you take them all!
Thanks!
Come on Dance!
Take the diesel, let's leave!
The Qureshi's will be here any
minute, if you could hurry please...
...why get into unwanted brawls...
am saying it for your own good.
For my good?
Stop! What do you
think you're doing...
Parma, seriously?!
Always remember Kanti, no smoking!!
He did give you the diesel,
then why unnecessarily...
To teach him a lesson!
This time l've only turned
his warehouse into an oven...
...but in future if he
favours the Qureshi's...
...l'll turn it into his graveyard!
Die traitor! Die!
Qureshi sir owns the best
guns...some even imported...
Yeah! but l rarely get to
touch Abbu's (father's) guns...
...this one will be mine.
You should buy a sling to
aim at raw mangoes instead...
Who is going to aim at raw mangoes?!
l'm going to blast the
heads of those bloody Chauhans!
Yes...you blast their
heads and they blast yours...
...but it's us
commoners who will bleed.
How much?
Rs.20,000.
Rs.20,000?!
This is a copy, made locally,
that's why only Rs.20,000.
The original is for Rs.300,000
Here's Rs.8,000, remaining Rs.12,000,
you'll get it on Eid festival.
Pay the full amount and
only then you get the gun.
Don't you mess with
an MLA's daughter!
Or should l just call up Abbu,
and he will set you straight!
Go ahead, call him!
Gold earrings...real
gold...we're even now!
Don't you want the bullets?
Why wouldn't l not want the bullets?!
Hey! Let's go...
Where were you?!
Your mom has called six times...
didn't you hear the phone ring?
lt's so noisy out here,
can't even hear gunshot!
Really!
Hi Ammi (mother)...heading home now...
Are you serious, you expect me to
bunk college and go buy the earrings?
And who'd make up for
my attendance...
...you, the jeweler,
or Javed's mother?
Anyway...when's Abbu going
to file his nomination papers?
He's done it already?
Without me...told him a hundred
times that l wanted to come along...
l don't want to hear anything...
you tell him he's in trouble.
Damn it! He has filed
the papers without me!
Ok calm down now and
show me the earrings.
Earrings?
Go on...fire away...it's loaded!
And the earrings?
l traded the earrings for this.
So what are you going
to wear this evening?
Now the party is for Abbu
contesting the elections.
The sparkle of my earrings
won't win him any extra votes...
...as for Mr. Javed...
...if he doesn't like my pretty
face without fancy earrings...
...then he may as well marry
a jeweler...and go to hell!
That's exactly what he'll do!
Come on old man...make way!
You will end up in the hospital,
and l'll have to deal with the mess.
The Qureshi lineage starts here...
these are Zoya's grand-parents...
god bless their soul...
My eldest sister...her husband,
your uncle...
Salavalekum! (Greetings!)
His three sons...
Salavalekum!
Salavalekum!
Mehtab, my younger brother...
Salavalekum!
...his two sons...Sohraab...
Salavalekum!
...and Shadaab.
Salavalekum!
This is me...your mom-in-law...
and this is our Zoya.
Abbu...
Here comes Ms. Earthquake!
Abbu...
Where did you graduate from?
London School of Medical Science...
Sala...valekum!
Hello!
Hello!
Abbu! This is not done!
What have l done?
l'm only showing the
family tree you made to Javed...
Very nice tree...is
Arts & Craft your hobby?
lt was. 8 years ago,
back in my seventh grade.
Now my hobby is hunting! Ok?!
Why didn't you take me
along to file the papers?
What would you have
done in all that chaos...
l took your brothers along...
Fine! Then ask them to get
you all the votes as well.
You won't get a single
vote from my college now!
We'll get him the votes.
Now you know Javed,
how she threatens me...
Zoya! How could you come
here looking all shabby...
Come on lets go...
l'm not even going to
attend the party tonight!
No one is going to let
you in these rags...
That's my waistcoat
you're calling a rag!
Zoya gets my old worn out
waistcoats altered and wears them.
How often have l asked her
to get herself a new one!
That's Zoya's for you...rigid!
No gun or canon can shake her.
You be careful dear Javed...
...don't ever hurt her...
...or else this family
army of mine...
...will surely kill you.
Not a joke...seriously!
We will kill anyone, who hurts Zoya.
Understood?
...Chand's body is an atom bomb!
Chand's figure is killing!
Chand your body is
like a cell phone...
...oh baby, make me its ring tone...
Hail Hanuman!
Was Kanti's warehouse
overflowing with diesel?
Dadda had asked for only
six cans, l picked up ten!
Parma! Come up now.
Hang on Amma (mother),
Dadda's been asking for the diesel.
l have to talk to you first!
Alright! l am coming...
Amma you're prayers
have been answered...
...l've finally made
Dadda happy today.
lf my prayers were answered,
l'd be dead by now!
What nonsense!
l've always prayed that
you never follow...
...in your grandfather's footsteps...
...and if you do, God
should kill me before that...
...but you've outdone your
grandfather...- But obvious!
...and sadly l'm still alive...
You have no idea what happened today?
Say sorry.
To whom?
Say sorry to them.
Who is them?
You're kidding me!
Give them this money
for their losses.
Amma, now this is...
Parme!
Take this...
No it's ok...
l insist...
Now give...
Give me your damn forgiveness!
No, really it's ok.
Give or else...
Given sir given! Forgiven!
And Kanti...next time you come
crying to Amma, l'll bloody...
Parma! your language is disgusting...
What else am l supposed to say?
Dadda got him his license...
...and he's busy making
money selling oil to the enemy!
So in lieu of the license
you'll burn his warehouse?
What a team you
are...grandfather and son!
Yes we are a team! l'm proud of
being Surya Chauhan's grandson...
...that's why l
managed to get the diesel...
...else tonight we'd be
sitting in darkness...
...and the Qureshi's
would be celebrating Diwali!
Kanti you jerk, once
the elections are over...
...l'll make sure your
license gets cancelled...
...serves you right!
Your entire family should've burnt...
...you know we will win...
...and if after that l don't get
your house raided l'll change my name!
Call Aggarwal instead...
...he is expensive but at
least he'll guarantee delivery.
What happened?
Those bloody dogs
Chauhan...they took away our diesel.
Get your guns out and let's get
our diesel back from the rascals.
Why not! They're just
waiting right now thinking...
Oh Zoya! Please come,
take back what's yours!
Listen! All l'm saying...
Mind your own business...
We'll deal with it...you calm down.
Hello? Aggarwal...
Those rascals stole our diesel Ammi.
What's your father there for...
...he'll pour the very same diesel
on their house and set it on fire!
My naughty Ammi!
Are you just going to make me slog?
Won't you feed me anything?
Get the damn thing started...l'll
treat you to a full tandoori chicken!
Hail tandoori chicken!
Tandoori! Tandoori! Tandoori!
C'mon...c'mon...
The whiskey goes inside,
ask me before serving it.
Only beer to the party workers.
l clearly said strong beer...
...these drunkards don't
understand light beers!
What's up with these bloody lights?!
Has the generator's
sister gotten raped?
Why is it dying out like this?
Parma! Hurry up with that thing...
...before Dadda fires a
double barrel up your sorry bum!
This is a household driven by men.
A household driven by men,
that talks like a man!
Looks like Chand will
actually end up dancing in the dark!
Show the generator some love!
l'm telling you Kanti sold
us water instead of diesel!
My oldest
daughter-in-law died of dengue.
The only family now
remaining is me, my son...
...my grandsons Dharma, Karma...
...and Parma.
His father died in an accident.
But l've given my son's widow
and her son a room upstairs...
...l even give them money
for their monthly expenditure.
Anyway...why are you in
such a hurry? Stay a while...
lt's the election pressure.
l thought l'd
personally request you...
...to co-operate in
carrying them out peacefully.
Almore has a very bad reputation
when it comes to elections...
...and we should avoid
any riots this time.
Listen, if any of my
party-men break the law...
...l'll personally bring them to you.
You can jail them or
hang them if you want.
l guarantee that none of the
Chauhans will misbehave...
...but you need to
warn the Qureshis too.
lf they cross the line, then my men
will not just sit back and take it...
...like l said, this
is a household of men!
l've just met the Qureshis as well,
Mr Aftaab has promised to...
That's it! lf Mister
Aftaab behaves...
...then it will be
all peace and quiet.
My clan, we're all Gandhi-disciples.
lf Mr Aftaab has promised, l
give you the mother of all promises!
We're done here! Good night!
What's happening with these damn
lights? Can somebody look into it?!
Parma! Have you eloped with
the damn generator's sister?
Hurry up and fix it!
Yeah! l'm doing it...
Just do one thing right!
Just one thing!
C'mmon start it in the name of Chand.
Chand...Chand...Chand...
There you go!
Even the generator gets
turned on at the mention of Chand!
Drink up...l'll go tell Dadda.
Chand Baby! When is
she going to come?!
Chauhan sir, is she gonna show up
or we'll have to go away thirsty!
Why isn't the whore here yet?
lf she does not show up,
forget about winning the elections.
This lot won't vote for me
until they've had their fill of...
...Chand's moves and
imported alcohol.
The generator's started Dadda...
...now you needn't
worry about the lights.
Did you get through to her?
Chand's not picking up,
neither is anyone at the brothel.
Who'd gone to book
Chand for this evening?
Parma!
Where do you think you're going?
Once again you've
managed to mess it up.
l'd fixed the date, time,
everything...
Did you pay the advance?
Yes, did that too.
Did she buy her
coffin with that money?
l'll go right away and
drag her here by her plait.
At least do one thing right!
Just one thing!
Don't worry Dadda...
Chand will definitely
dance at your birthday...
ldiots! l was drunk, but
why didn't you stop me?!!
lt's not like we were
on a pilgrimage.
Plus you didn't tell us the
money was for the advance...
But that was one
crazy party that night!
Now if we don't get Baby back,
it'll be one bloody funeral tonight!
Where's she going to go? You
were itching for a hunt right?
C'mmon lets hunt!
She hurts like a bullet,
She bursts like a bomb,
Lovers beware,
she's the dynamite doll
Chand baby is it, or
the end of the world?
The Titanic of all lovers,
The Titanic of all lovers,
Took me to sea and took me down.
My love, my rogue, by jove!
l thought he was the golden boy,
Yes l thought he was the golden boy,
The cheapster got a kiss out of me,
with a mere movie in return.
My love, my rogue, by jove!
l died in his arms last night,
Yes, l died in his arms last night,
and the rascal flew away by dawn.
l thought he was the teacher of love,
the disaster, failed in
the first lesson of love.
He thinks he's a dude
ln fact he is a kid.
l stay awake, my heart's at stake
And he snores away the night!
My rogue, my love, by jove!
My sweetheart by jove
My rogue, by jove
Hero, lover, rogue, by jove
My rogue lover, by jove!
Ammi help!
Shut up!
You shut up!
Who the hell are you to barge into
our house and ask us to shut up?
l won't even take a
piss at your house!
Chand is
ours...we've come to take her...
Hey you accompanists!
C'mmon get up.
And you Chand! Hold my
waist and sit tight.
Let's go!
Move aside you lizard!
You ass! How dare you
point a gun at my daughter!
Oh shutup!
Shadaab, lets go after
them...get the jeep out!
Catch them before they cross the
railway-line and thrash them to pulp!
Zoya! You stay home.
He pointed the gun at me
in front of everyone...
...so l'm going to be
the first one to slap him.
And what are we there for?
Let's not waste time here...
Bikram! Had fun hunting?!
Oh yes!
Drive faster!
Chandu, you go straight,
l'll head this way...
Oh yeah! You want to
act smart with me?!
Where did that jerk go?
Get that ass!
You bloody ass!
Chand! Watch out!
Go home! Loser!
Where are you going...
Loser?!! You're a loser,
your entire family is a loser...
Where do you think you're going?
l'll come to your house
and kill you, you ass!
Stop! Let him go! We'll
deal with the jerk later!
l'll kill him!
No wait! Let's go!
Where's Dadda?
ln the room.
You wait here; l'll go get him.
Now simmer down Collector!
l assure you it won't happen again...
...l'll warn him!
Dadda! Didn't l promise,
Chand will dance at your party...
How many shots did you fire?
l didn't really count...
50...75...maybe...
For the amount you
wasted on firing bullets...
...l would've bought off ten
whores and tied them to a pole!
But Dadda l did it
to save your honour!
Had l asked you to
kidnap the bloody whore?
What if there was bloodshed?
The Collector wasn't here
to distribute candies...
...he came to warn us.
Did it for my honor, did you?!
Your mother already
put my honor at stake...
...the day she became a widow.
What's Amma's
widow-hood got to do with this?
No more nuisance till
the elections are over...
...damn Qureshis are not
going to take this lightly.
Should l concentrate on
campaigning for the elections...
...or digging their graves?
Let's go Dadda!
Chand's wating for you.
Don't boil your blood
over this moron!
Dadda, you know Chand
won't start without you...
There's not one thing that
this jackass can do right!
Don't you stare back
at me! Don't you dare!
l would've made mince
meat out of that ass.
Why did you take off
with these boys?
He'd pointed a gun at me...
Once they brought the
Chauhan boys back here...
...you could have
slapped him a hundred times...
But Abbu...
Enough! Don't cross the line.
lt's hard to find you suitors because
of this dare devil attitude...
...Javed was a London educated boy,
he may have tolerated your ways...
l don't want someone to
tolerate my ways! Javed is a wimp...
Parma had a gun pointed at me
and Javed didn't say a word.
l'll marry someone who'll
happily take a bullet for me...
You won't find someone like that.
lt's not like l'm dying
to get married either!
So if you don't want to get
married what do you want to do?
Become an MLA, just like Abbu.
Why're you laughing?
Come inside now...
She wants to become an MLA...
Why are you laughing?
- Try Prime Minister instead!
l will become a MLA and l'll beat
the Chauhans by record margins...
...and not just once but 50 times!
Who instilled pride into Almore?
Who installed computers at
every school, college and village?
Aftaab Qureshi did.
A computer stands for progress,
no progress - no prosperity.
ln the last five years of
holding office Aftaab Qureshi...
...has turned Almore into a
wealthy and opportunity-laden town.
lt's now time to thank
him for his efforts...
...mark your vote for the
election symbol 'Computer'.
lf all our MLAs turn out
to be as hot as her...
...the country is sure to progress.
My vote is going in her box.
Dont run! lt's just fire-crackers...
...not a damn
bomb...come back or l'll...
Qureshis will lose, this time...
...every time...time and again...
Stop this nonsense!
How dare you take off our banners?
The losing Party doesn't get
to put up their banners...
Your family will lose...
Oh! You think we'll lose?
Who took Chand away from
right under your nose?
We did!
So who won?
We did!
Correct.
Long live Surya Chauhan!
Long live! Long live!
Repeat idiots.
Long live Surya Chauhan!
Long live Surya Chauhan!
Down with Surya Chauhan!
Long live Aftaab Qureshi!
Down with Aftaab Qureshi!
Cow Dung in Surya Chauhan's mouth...
...cow dung in his
entire families' mouths!
Cow dung huh?
Yeah!
Take this...cow dung!
Yeah baby!
Give Qureshi a good shower!
A stream of piss on your dad's face!
A stream of piss on Qureshi's face!
Parma don't do it!
Don't make matters worse!
Go for it! Shower him!
l'll bathe him in it...
...and if l meet him,
l'll make him drink it too!
Let me...
Serve it to him 'on the rocks' baby!
Say Sorry!
Say sorry now!
Parma shoot her!
Don't spare the witch!
Apologize now!
Parma no! Think of what your
Granddad said! Law 'n 'order!
Say sorry!
Parma shoot her...
What are you laughing at? Say sorry!
Parma just fire...
Zoya...run!
She has just insulted you!
We'll take care of
law and order later!
You pull the trigger...shoot her!
She's not going to
college from tomorrow.
Get her a tutor...
...if she doesn't want to
study sitting at home..
..let her not study at all!
Abbu he misbehaved...
You should've told us,
we'd cut him to size.
Then do it!
What good is just one slap?
Zoya!
Muslim votes alone
are not enough to win.
lf we draw swords with
the Chauhans right now...
...the Hindus currently
supporting us, will change sides.
You don't understand this!
Look, you do what you have to...
...but she's not going to college
from tomorrow and that's final!
lf l stop going to college...
...won't they think that
they've managed to scare us off!
lt's all politics Ammi, you
won't understand, right Abbu?
You learn to control your anger!
Okay. Sure.
The Qureshis are also
going to Mirzapur tomorrow.
So?! Are we scared of them?!
He's right!
Learn the ropes of politics from him!
Mirzapur is a Muslim dominated town...
...if we hold a rally tomorrow...
...we risk a miniscule
turnout and will look like fools!
Cancel Mirzapur...but
don't let the day go waste.
So let's conduct the
college rally then?
Will you be able to gather a
strong crowd by the afternoon?
Hey! Parma!
Huh?
Will you be able to?
lt's been five years he's been
hanging around at the college.
You must've done your
PHD by now Dr Parma...
...or are you still
languishing in the first year?
Dharma, you take care
of the college rally.
Today you've lapped up
even the bitter gourd...
That's cause you've
cooked it so well...
What's cooking in your head?
My job is to eat. l can't cook!
Don't try to fool me!
Out with the truth!
Why this non-stop smiling?
Just like that!
Liar!
l swear on you.
Keep lying!
l'm not looking forward
to a long life anyway.
So what made him relent?
Abbu...one mango-sweet smile...
...and he melted just like that!
l'll be back.
Wait...
...l'll stand guard.
lf he dares to come into the ladies
toilet, he'll get such a beating...
...that he won't be
able to ever pee again!
Ass!
Just be careful...
What're you doing in
the ladies toilet?
Sorry...
...l messed up, forgive me!
l'll kill you!
Kill me!
But forgive me!
Let go of my hand...
Stop running like a
headless chicken and listen!
Let go of my hand you crazy creep...
Not crazy...love-crazy.
How dare you?
Just the way you dared to
slap me in front of everyone!
l dug my gun into your
forehead and you didn't even blink!
Swear to god...
...l've seen such a dare devil
attitude for the first time!
l've fallen in love with you.
C'mmon now forgive me
and become love-crazy!
You still don't get it do you?
There's a full-tanker
of blood in my body...
...drain it all out...but l'll
keep asking you for forgiveness.
Have you seen my brothers?
Very ugly, l must say!
They'll make mince meat out of you!
l'll settle their scores
with them...yours with you!
Why? Have you forgotten the slap?
Score settled!
Your forgiveness
remains...at least settle that!
lf you have the guts...
...come to my house
and take my forgiveness.
Let go!
Shh! lf we get caught together...
...no one will believe
that l forced myself in...
...if word spreads,
you'll be disgraced...
...your family will lose face...
...forget about your father
winning the elections then.
l'm saying it for
your father's good...
...don't scream ok...l'm letting go.
Hey you silly lizard!
The revolver...put it in.
l'll come back...to
ask for forgiveness.
What's happening inside...
...open up or l'll call the principal!
Good morning maa'm!
Why had you locked the door?
l didn't do it! A monkey had
gotten in, he must've done it.
Don't argue...move aside!
Keep yourself free tonight...
l'll come for your forgiveness.
Bloody infidel!
Why should l forgive?
Catch him...catch him!
Parma has broken inside...
...jerk, you want to
ask for forgiveness...
What? He's really here!
Ask us you jerk!
We'll give you forgiveness...
...you're dead!
Shadaab...enough!
Elections...
l'm not going to leave him...
Think about Abbu...elections...
You go inside!
Whack the jerk!
Throw the ass outside...
Turn off the light!
Let's go...
Where to?
...graveyard...
Will you bury me dead or alive?
Don't you touch me or l'll
really shoot you this time.
But forgive me before that.
ls it really that tough
to do such a simple thing?
Today you're asking me for my
forgiveness, tomorrow it'll be my love.
A story which can't be
brought to its end...
...shouldn't be
written in the first place...
...and if at all one
has started writing it...
...then all the pages
must be torn and burnt!
Huh?
My family will kill you
and yours will kill me!
ls it my fault that
you were born a Muslim?
Your fault...
...you infidel.
Wimp!
Don't call me a wimp!
Then do as your heart desires...
...go on...don't feel shy!
Fine, l forgive you.
Do it with love...
Accept it with my
hatred...or else buzz off!
When can l come to
get one with love?
Whenever your heart
desires a beating!
And if my heart desires you...
Then jump in front of a speeding
train with your heart and all.
Long live Aftaab Qureshi...
Down with Surya Chauhan!
l look for you with
new eyes, everywhere
l find new sights,
likewise, everywhere
My heart's a flutter, l feel
lt's flirting with danger, l feel
Restless, l'm restless
Where are those flames?
Restless, l'm restless
Where are those pains?
Joya...
ZZZZ...Zoya
ZZZZ...Joya!
But that is what l'm saying!
Joya!
Yes absolutely correct...Joya!
The streets are swooning...
They're merging with you...
The cross-roads, the
mile-stones are calling for you.
My heart is tired of treading, l feel
lt's yearning to fly, l feel
Restless, l'm restless
What l aspire
Restless, l'm restless
Of my desire
l'm blushed, l'm flushed,
for the first time
l'm breathing, l'm dreaming,
for the first time
These drops of fondness
l savour the sweetness
l am not me, no more.
My heart's changing
it's take, l feel
lt's turning my fate, l feel
Restless, l'm restless
The intoxication
Restless, l'm restless
The exhilaration
Restless, l'm restless
Where are those flames?
Restless, l'm restless
Where are those pains?
Parma...
...after we're married...hmm?
So let's get married...
You'll marry me?
Why? What's wrong with you?
Don't sweet talk me!
Spending a moment
together is so difficult...
...if we get married,
there'll be communal riots in town.
So then forget about me...
...if you love me...then
accept me completely...with pride!
Parma...
What's the worst that can happen?
They'll be upset initially...
...but once we're married they'll
have no choice but to accept it...
lf they don't...
We'll run away...
l'm not leaving my town
Almore to go anywhere.
What does Almore have anyway?
l'll take you to Delhi...
...ok to Mumbai?
Become a heroine there!
l'm staying right
here to become an MLA.
What?!
Why are you laughing?
l'll become a MLA
one day...just watch!
Get married first
and then become one...
Will you convert to lslam?
Cause l'm sure not marrying
an infidel and going to hell!
Then l'll go with you to heaven...
You're willing to give up
on your faith so easily?
For you l'd give up
any faith or religion...
Please don't!
Otherwise one day you'll give
me up this easily as well...
You meet me here with a
wedding dress tomorrow.
Enough fooling around...
...we'll be hurting our families...
l've decided...
...tomorrow, l'm going
to wait here for you...
...if you don't turn up,
forget about me.
lt's not an out...bowl again!
Look who is here! Our fielder...
...not in the mood to
field today Tendulkar?
Ok, go ahead you can bat...
lf the Chauhans win, they'll make
Almore their personal property...
if they win forget getting
your licence or permit...
...then you'll have to
go pleading to them...
Where's Ammi?
Upstairs...
...have a bite at least...
Why is Abbu in such a bad mood?
You just keep issmiling,
everyone's temper will come down.
lt's not issmile Ammi, it's smile!
That's what l said...
...issmile!
lssmile!
Parma's Joya...
...Joya's Parma...
Zoya...
Parma...
Allah forgive my sin!
Parma...
Par...
Parvez!
Zoya-Parvez.
So you finally turned up?!
Very smart Mr. Parma!
Come, let's get married!
My best friends...
...Mr. Bikram...
...Mr. Chandu.
Hello...
Hello...
Sister-in-law.
Hello sister-in-law.
Many many best returns
of the day sister-in-law!
Where do l set up for the rituals?
Anywhere...right here...
Why a Hindu Priest?
l'm ready to convert for you...
...you can't go through a
few Hindu rituals for me?
l'll be ready in a jiffy!
l'm coming in...
No!
You're not allowed to see
the bride before the nuptials.
Did you read the kalma?
Yes l've read it,
l've converted to lslam.
What have you renamed yourself as?
Akbar.
Akbar?! You found the name
in a history book, did you?
l've got a better name...
...Parvez.
Parvez?
Zoya's Parvez.
Do you accept Parvez as your husband
according to the lslamic law?
l do.
And do you...
l do. l accept Joya.
l accept all my matrimonial
promises as per the Hindu laws...
Me too...
Sorry buddy...one more!
Show me?
Nice?
Done? Everybody leave...
...you too sir!
l'll slap you if you
force yourself on me.
But we're married...
Not here...there is no privacy.
Shy?
Fine, come...
...l've booked a 5 star
honeymoon deluxe for you.
Never heard of ladies first?
Help me with the dress.
The window...
lt'll tear!
Did you get it from Delhi or Mumbai?
Your perfume's nice.
Parma wake up...
...Parma wake up, l'm hungry...
...treat me to an ice cream...
...wake up or
l'll give you a tight...
Slap?
And insult me again?
You haven't forgotten
that college-slap yet?
Me? No...
...and l'll never let
you forget it either.
l'd rather die than
convert to lslam...
That's enough Parma...
l didn't read the kalmah
or marry you for real!
You slapped me; l took my revenge...
...we're even!
Parma l don't like
such disgusting jokes...
You'll become a joke now!
Try telling anyone...
Parma, is my husband,
he has deserted me!
Your own family will
not support you.
For all that attitude...
you're actually quite stupid.
Parma enough!
The word will eventually spread...
...you'll be disgraced.
Here's an idea...
...you're the only one who
can match Chand Baby's looks.
Why don't you become a sex-worker?
l'll do the publicity...
...and come visit every day...
...even pay you double. Ok?
So see you then at Kwality Bar!
Mobile! Mobile!
Long live! Long live!
Long live Surya Chauhan!
Long live! Long live!
Long live Surya Chauhan!
Parma's promise forever...
We'll win, again and again!
Parma!
Mobile! Mobile! Mobile!
Long live Surya Chauhan!
Long live! Long live!
Parvati! Your Parma has
made us Chauhans proud today.
Learn the game of politics from him!
But what magic did Parma weave...
...that no one ended up
voting for the 'Computer'?
That's between me and Dadda...
...but one thing's for sure...
...the Qureshis won't
even get a sucked mango...
...right Dadda?
Sucked mango!
Parma Chauhan...
Long live! Long live!
These pictures have been sent
to all cell-phones in Almore...
Can't we trace the number?
No, they've been sent
through the internet...
...everyone's
clueless about the source...
Who is the jerk with Zoya?
No one knows...
...but Hindus and Muslims,
all over, are saying...
...that a man incapable of
controlling his spoilt daughter...
...can't control Almore either...
...and if the MLA's
daughter marries an infidel...
...it'll set a bad example
for all young boys and girls.
Hamid, Farooqi, Saeed Anwar...
...all advised their camps
against voting for us...
...jerks come pleading
for favours all the time.
This is Surya Chauhan's ploy...
But it is Zoya's doing...
...how else would
these photos be possible.
She's sold her faith...
...and will burn in hell...
...but along with her, on judgement
day, we'll all be in trouble.
Where's Zoya?
Zoya!
Zoya!
The boy's become a man...
The boy's become a man...
Like a chicken, you flap about...
Among your mates, you brag around...
l do not brag, l state the fact...
l roar, l've scored, l am a man!
You can't deny me,
Come on now baby,
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon now...
l am now a man!
The boy's become a man...
The boy's become a man...
My boy...
Boy?!
l'll tell you why...
This manhood is not a toy
What else is it?
Go and learn...
What?
And understand...
Understand what?
How to quench these burning fires!
Only then you little boy
will grow up to be a man!
The rascal has become a man!
O chand baby...
What?
Just give me a chance...
And why?
l will put out every fire...
l have learnt...
l've understood...
l know how to fulfill
every desire...
O really!
C'mon c'mon c'mon now...
The boy has become a man!
The boy has become a man!
l'm a man, brimming with manhood...
l'm bored of your crowing dear...
My man is one who takes
my hand, without fear...
l will take you...anytime, anywhere.
l know your type, cut out the hype!
Loud and proud,
l scream and shout
C'mon c'mon c'mon now baby
The boy has become a man!
O boy! Can you sing!
Like a chicken, you flap about...
l roar like a man.
Among your mates, you brag around...
l've scored, l am a man!
lf l want to,
l could take you!
King of brag,
Lets see what you've got!
You will drown,
Your beauty will be trounced,
l will set fire,
Burn you down.
This vanity,
will make me stay.
lf you're a real man
Don't walk away
l'm here to stay
Don't walk away...
l'm here to stay
Don't walk away...
C'mon c'mon c'mon now baby
The boy has become a man!
The boy has become a man!
Parma come with me!
Amma?!
Where are you taking me...
...Chand will leave!
Parvati don't insult him...
...your son is now a man!
Dadda, Amma's temper is rising.
l'll make her simmer
down and be right back.
Mom at least today,
don't get angry...
You ass!
Don't be stupid...
let's talk this out.
Move aside! Or else
l'll kill you too...
l am telling you, let's
talk and sort this out!
l don't want to talk
about anything...
This animal won't give
in like this...
l'm trying to talk...but
she just won't let me.
How did this lizard get here?
Did you marry her?
Are you mad?! l won't
get married secretly.
lt'll be a big disco party.
Your Parma will arrive on
an elephant for all to see!
Explain this then!
l disgraced the Qureshis...
...to make Dadda win the election!
So l've brought pride to the family...
pride for Parma, pride for you!
Pride?
She'd slapped me...
l just had a good time at her
expense and avenged my insult...
'Had a good time'?
Tell her the truth...
...he tricked me into bed!
lt was all a farce anyway! The lmaam
asked me to repeat 'l do' and l did!
Avenge your insult...a good time...
...are you having a
good time now?...are you?
Apologize to her...
l don't want his apology,
l want him dead...
Shut up! Ask for forgiveness!
Forgiveness for what?
Even after behaving
like a disgusting creep...
...you want to know why
you should apologize?!
Since when has deceiving
a Muslim become a crime?
What kind of a rotten
animal have you become...
...you don't see your fault?
You've ruined her...
...her family won't
accept her back...
...and yours will kill her!
Where'll she go?
To hell...bloody bad omen!
Not bad omen...
...she's your wife...
...your responsibility now!
Don't be stupid...
...Dadda will kill us!
That's it?
That's your bravado?
Amma are you drunk?
Save me...l'm here...
Your granddad's
calling you...come out...
Tell him l'll be
with him in a second...
lf these men get a whiff,
they'll tear you to pieces.
Go on, l'll be out in a minute.
l said l'm coming, go on!
You go down,
l'll take care of her...
You don't bother l will fix her...
Parme...
...go down!
You're inviting big trouble Amma.
Zoya!
Get this opened!
Open up or l'll break it down...
Who is this?
...have you found Zoya?
No, l found her phone
lying outside her room...
...any news?
No we're still searching...
She didn't leave a single clue...
A clue to what?
Clue to nailing the jerk she married!
Let's worry about Zoya first...
Did she worry about us?
Oh Allah! Please protect
my daughter from the enemy.
Where did you get this?
Who taught you to shoot?
l got carried away...
l swear l'll not kill
your son, let me go!
You expect me to believe you?
My family will come to rescue me...
...they'll make you all
weep tears of blood...
...you won't be spared either.
You think they'll
embrace you with glee?
Of course!
Qureshis and Chauhans
are one and the same...
...if you go back won't
they cut you to pieces?
Never...
...l'm their blood after all...
...every one's precious.
l'm warning you, let me go...
...let me go or l'll scream...
Shut up or l'll slap you!
Sit down...
Sit!
Punish Parma however you want...
...but don't desert him.
With you by his side...
...maybe there's hope for this animal
to transform into a human being.
Even god almighty cannot
make that bloody animal a human.
lf he dies, it will be in
everyone's best interest!
Your love is not genuine either.
Had it been, you wouldn't
have given up on him so easily.
My love is genuine and that's
why l've come to kill him...
Dying or killing is easy...
...you'll kill him, his
grand dad will kill you...
...end of story!
At least then l'll die in peace...
What good is losing and dying?
Killing Parma is my victory...
Killing is not victory.
lf you are really brave...
...try transforming this
animal into a human being...
...try winning him over...
...that'll be victory!
He's the lmaam from the mosque...
...come on, start talking...
l am a poor man sir...
Parma bribed me and Mr.
Chaubey with Rs. 10,000 each...
...in the name of god,
we got them married...
...he'd threatened me,
that if l told anyone...
He'd just threatened
you...l'll kill you...
Why bully me, if you have no
control over your own women...
Sohraab!
No point beating the
lmam...get the car out...
Quddos, Fakhru, gather all the men...
Many small cities like Almore,
make one big lndia.
Almore grows, lndia grows.
lt's progress would
be lndia's progress.
As the new MLA, l'll work towards a
better future for Almore...for lndia.
l don't think like a pond frog...
...those who do are
no longer in office...
Dadda...Qureshis are coming...
Aftaab Qureshi is personally
coming to congratulate you?
How does that feel?
Don't know what his agenda is...
...but l'll have to
welcome Qureshi anyway.
We're done here...l have
to prepare for his welcome.
Karma!
Santosh, Susheel...cover the gate...
Birju, Gangu, Rawat,
Chattar...the terrace...
Moti you and Prakash
from the generator's side...
...get your weapons
and into position...
...the Qureshis will
be here any moment.
Who is it?
Amma! Open, Quick!
Hey...Get up...
...the witch's family is here...
...told you keeping her
here would be disastrous...
You're so dead!
Shut up!
Leave her...
Abbu!
There'll be a lot of bloodshed,
just kick her out...
No...
They'll kill me and you...
This is all your
doing...now we must pay for it!
Parma come quick!
Coming! You go ahead!
And get your pistol...
Yes l'll get it...go now!
l'm going to tell
Dadda she's hiding here...
No Parma!
This is your chance to make amends.
Save her life...don't tell anybody.
Parma, open the door!
Parma swear on me...not a word!
Yes Dadda...
The Qureshis are
coming...stay in your room.
Those jerks...l'll deal with them...
l said stay inside!
The situation's tricky...
...don't make it worse, be practical!
We've won the elections...
...no need for muscle-flexing anymore!
You haven't brought
the girl here have you?
No Dadda...why would l?
That girl's chapter is over...
Ages ago...
Why did you drag my
daughter in to the election?
We fight like men...
...we don't get women involved.
You're well aware of
your grandsons doing...
...we'll deal with him later...
...where have you hidden my daughter?
Why'd we hide her?
Your grandson eloped with her...
You're publicly declaring that your
daughter has eloped...really shameless!
No, l still have some shame left...
...that's why l've come
here to strangle her myself...
...hand her over...
...l'll bury her alive right here!
She's impure now and doesn't
even deserve a grave in my house.
You've lost the elections...
...instead of baseless
accusations accept defeat like a man.
lf l've said she's not here,
it means she's not here.
You expect us to believe you?
A Chauhan doesn't lie...
...we do things proudly,
openly for all to see...
...she's not here.
Sohraab...
...Shadaab lets go!
Uncle we can't leave
without taking Zoya...
Zoya's dead for me!
Let's go.
l want to go home...
...let me go home...
Don't be afraid...this is
now your house as well...
...no one will harm you here.
Amma!
Where are you taking her?
Parma! jerk you lied to me!
lt's not his
fault...l was hiding her...
Amma...stay out of
it...let Dadda handle this...
Parma married her...she is
our daughter-in-law now...
l've invested forty years in
building a political career...
...it'll all be ruined if l accept
this girl as my daughter-in-law...
She will stay right here.
Amma let go of the gun,
you'll get hurt...
Don't be stupid Parvati...
...only my diktat will
apply in this house.
Only on these eunuchs...
...for my son, my daughter-in-law,
it'll be my diktat...
Your diktat! Your daughter-in-law!
l'll show you who decides...
End of this
girl...end of all problems...
Amma!
Zoya run!
Amma you will be fine...
Parma! Amend your mistake Parme!
Amma...don't talk...
Make amends Parme!
That witch is responsible for this...
...go get her...she mustn't escape...
She's responsible
for Parvati's death...
...go, bring her back alive...
...l want to kill
her with my own hands.
l am really exhausted Bawra...l
don't feel like talking right now...
But listen...it's really important...
How often have l told you...
...to not to come into the
brothel during business hours...
l am a free citizen of a free lndia.
Free citizen my foot...
No one was really into
the performance today...
...even their tips were a joke!
They just went on about
the Qureshis and Chauhans...
So did the Qureshis
actually go over to kill Parma?
God keep Parma safe...
...the others can go to hell!
l've heard that Parma married Zoya...
l'm sure they're just rumors...
Darling it's important...
Not now Bawra...
Just hear me out...
Parma is here...in your room...
Really?
l knew it was all a rumour!
Parma's come back to his Chand...
No one knows, not
even Rukmani Aunty...
...l secretly got him in from
the storage room's back door...
Bawra Darling...
...what great news you have brought!
Ok, now scoot!
Oh my darling!
Oh my darling!
Parma, my love!
Grand dad is busy
fighting battles outside...
...while grandson is waiting for me...
...ok do whatever you
want...just make it quick...
Open your eyes!
Swear to god, you're the
only one who gets me all coy!
Baby, open your eyes...
Oh God! Another woman?
Keep her here...
So they're not rumours, its true...
...don't let her escape...
l'm expecting a client...
Ask him to get lost!
Will you buy my new outfit for Eid?
Baby really! Don't tell anyone!
What've you done to my Parma?
Let me see your face...
Dear god!
You are beautiful indeed!
Wait!
Now that the son is here,
he'll light the pyre.
Even if Parvati's gone you can
still come to me for anything.
Where did you bury that Muslim?
Don't touch me!
Mom's last wish was
for me to make amends...
...protecting Joya is
now my responsibility...
Jerk, l'll set you ablaze
in your mother's pyre...
...then the two of
you can keep playing...
...this game of
responsibility for eternity...
l'm a true blooded Chauhan...
...l can't go back on
my responsibilities...
One who favours a Muslim
is no longer a Chauhan...
...decide, your
lineage or your mother...
Amma.
Parma, put the gun down!
Don't do anything crazy...
Bikram, Chandu come with me...
Follow the Jerk...
...he'll return to her...
...kill them both!
Joya...
You want to sell me to the brothel...
...make me dance?
You bloody pimp!
Don't go outside,
it's dangerous...Joya.
You'll kill him? Just like that?
Yes! l'll kill him!
He's our Parma damnit!
He's a bit delusional
at the moment but...
He's betrayed the entire
clan for that witch...
l'll kill him...
No...
...not in public...
...lets chase her towards the
deserted lane and shoot her there.
Bloody witch!
Bikram...
Are you in your senses?
You're shooting at us?
Go away the two of you...
...leave...
Parma stay out of this...
...that witch has to die...
And if l stop you,
will you kill me as well?
We won't leave that wtch
alive to spread her mess...
Call her sister-in-law!
She is the enemy...
Sister-in-law!
She's ruined your faith as well.
She's responsible for
your mother's death...
...she is not my sister-in-law...
Bikram stop...
...l said stop!
You're not really my friends...
...get lost, both of you!
Jerk...we lied for you,
...risked our lives
for the fake marriage...
...clicked & distributed the
pictures into every house hold...
Leave or l'll...
Forgive me...
Honestly...
...not lying this
time...forgive me for real...
l'm genuinely asking
for forgiveness...
Parma...
...why did you do this to me...
...why did you deceive me?
Please forgive me...
Amma would have been alive
if l'd not done any of this...
...but if you don't forgive me...
...Amma's soul wont rest in peace...
Baby...come now...
Hey Raju...where the hell do
you hide my towel every time...
...come extinguish
this burning desire...
Chand...
Relax, my braveheart
it's just a scratch...
...it hurts badly, does it?
Watch how the pain disappears
soon as l bandage the wound.
Leave us alone...
...this is our personal
matter and we'll deal with it.
Personal...
...ripping his shoulder apart,
was that not personal?
lt's my will...
...heal him or kill
him...that's up to me...
...please leave...l
don't talk to dance-girls...
You may not talk to dance-girls...
...but your husband...
...up until yesterday was glued to us.
Anyway the reins are
in your hands now...
...hold them tight.
Throw the two of them out of here...
...their families will
burn this place down first...
...and kill them later.
People are thirsty for
their blood outside...
l don't care what's happening outside.
So we should just
hide and watch the show?
lt's our job to put on
a show, not watch...
...don't talk back...
lf we support
Parma...Muslims stop coming here...
...support Zoya, and Hindu's
will boycott our dance bar.
l'm throwing them out...
Listen to me my dear Rukmani Aunty...
...let's go down and l'll explain...
What're you gonna explain,
l know everything...
We've seen many animals...
...here Parma is, trying to change...
...if giving him shelter,
helps him become human...
...then by saving their lives...
...you've done a pilgrimage
sitting here, think about it.
But if you throw them out now,
...and they're killed,
you'll be an accomplice...
...then you'll go to hell for sure.
Foolish girl, if your
heart beats for him...
...why care about saving Zoya's life?
My heart beats for him...
...so l'll protect
whoever his heart beats for.
Don't know about you...
...but to save them, l
can't risk all your lives...
...you two...get out right away!
Alright, l'll take
them both to Rosy's bar...
...l'll work there...
...swear to god,
l'll never come back...
Chand...don't threaten me with Rosy...
Then let them stay here...
Fine...but as soon as the
wound heals, l'll throw them out...
Bawra...you brought
them in here, didn't you?
You are fired!
Rs. 750 is the fixed rate...
...why should l accept only Rs.500?
Are you family that l'll give
you a discount? Bloody tramp!
lf you can't afford it
go back to your wife...
You're so amazingly beautiful...
...all along you've
loved this infidel...
...but all l saw in you,
was a Muslim...
...today for the first time
l've seen the real Joya...
...so very beautiful.
l've even called you beautiful...
...now you should forgive me!
Joya, do you want a pillow?
Parma, the Qureshis are here...
...what now?!
You two hide
somewhere...l'll distract them.
They're heading as one,
They're bonding as one,
They're beating as one,
The two hearts...
They're walking as one,
They're meeting as one,
They're eating as one,
The two hearts.
The ends of their heart,
Are tying as one,
They're flying as one...
Crazily in love, Love-crazy.
Love-crazy, the love-crazy!
Every ache of the heart,
Every ache of the heart,
ls for your sake...
Everything l won,
l lost for your love.
Make me a part of you,
l'm nothing, apart from you.
l colour my life, my
life with yours...
You are mine, l'm your's...
Crazily in love, Love-crazy.
Love-crazy, the love-crazy!
Let's wake our dreams,
Let's wake our dreams,
With the warmth of our hearts.
Let's stop the tears,
With the joy in our hearts.
Let's rescue our tomorrow,
From the ashes of yesterday.
Let's glow, let's grow...
Let's stand tall, let's go...
Crazily in love, Love-crazy.
Love-crazy, the love-crazy!
Joya!
Joya take them off!
Hey chill!
What's the harm if she
wants to dance a little?
You stay out of this!
Parma!
l want to dance!
Take them off...
l want to dance...
Are you mad...you want to
become a whore like them?
They have saved our lives...
...don't abuse them.
Don't argue...you can't
have everything your way!
Who the hell are you to stop me?
Your husband.
Only forcefully.
However...a husband is a husband!
So you think!
Joya listen!

Okay!
But we will get married right here.
Here? This is a whore house!
But there's peace and harmony here.
So should we turn the whole world into
a whore house for peace and harmony?
Rubbish you say...

convert to Parvez right?
We're love-crazy!
Don't need to change anything...

Get up or l'll slap you!
Think about it again...
...you guys can stay here

No, l think now...

Can't make a brothel
your home, can you?
Take care of Parma...
...if you trouble him then
you'll have to deal with me.
Go now...
...l don't want
tears to ruin my mascara.
Alright Chand, catch you later...
Yeah right!
You've already caught
someone just like yourself...
...now get out of here...Jerk!
Think about it again...
Don't worry...it'll all be fine.
Joya, you're not aware of...
Parme!
So your plan is to get me
thrashed in your neighbourhood.
On Eid you will get
gifts...not thrashing!
Let's go!
We'll see what we get!
Ammi!
Zoya!
Happy Eid!
Your father...
Where is he?
...he'll slaughter you!
Yeah right...Abbu will slaughter me?
He's never raised his voice on me.
Hey! Where did you get stuck now?
Who got stuck where?
My husband.
Stay in my room for now...
...dad must be very angry...
...l'll go pour some love on his hot
temper, cool him and then call you.
Come Ammi...
Abbu!
How dare you come back?
'Cause l know you all
have been missing me.
'Cause l know you'll
pretend to be angry at first...
...then like always,
you'll forgive and embrace...
...me and Parma.
lt's because of him l'm alive...
...his Amma sacrificed
her life to save me...
...Abbu please accept him.
You've disgraced us...
...people say Afaab Qureshi has
betrayed his religion, his community...
...and you want me to forgive you?
Embrace that infidel?
You want a gift for Eid right?
l'll give you a gift...wait!
What are you
doing...she's your daughter...
Get out of my way...
Abbu!
Hey Abbu, don't pull the
trigger or Ammi is dead.
Put the gun down...
Make him put it down first...
Dad you're just scaring us right?
But l'm not trying to scare...
l'll pull the trigger for real...
Parma let me handle this...
You say we're dead for
you right...fine so be it!
But don't harm her...
...you put your gun down...
l'll put down mine as well...
Dad he really loves me a lot...
...and makes me very happy...
No, let them go...
...just let them be...
Qudoos Fakhru...go after them!
Joya, let's go!
Jaipur is safe and far away!
Don't worry...
...l'll be back in two seconds.
A bottle of water
and a pack of biscuits.
Joya?
You jerk!
Where's Joya?

Take this witch away...finish her!
Joya!
Joya!
You'd said two seconds...
...you took longer than two seconds!
Sorry...
Parma you jerk...you won't escape...
Not there! Let's go up!
Quick!
Have you had a Happy Eid?!
Have you?
Lot of faith you have in your
family...some good that has done!
Forget about sweets, they
didn't even offer water.
Chased the life out of
us...thanks to them...
...now even my family knows...great!
Happy Eid!
We should've stayed at the brothel...
Go on cry if you want,
don't be embarrassed...
l'm not crying.
lt's these chemicals...
they're making my eyes water...
Yeah right!
Your dad wanted to shoot
you...that wouldn't make you cry...
...must be very amusing...
Yes that does make laugh.
Are the chemicals
really bothering you?
Chemicals don't bother me.
l've always aced Chemistry.
ln my first and second
year...scored a full hundred...
...if l get a hundred again...
...l will get a gold medal!
Your dad must have influenced the
principal and gotten you the hundreds.
Don't talk about Abbu!
Sorry!
lt's just that l've
never met a topper before.
You are amazing...
...gold medal!
A score of hundred on hundred!
l love chemistry...
...the lab...the smell
of these chemicals...
...do you even know what this is?
Copper Sulphate.
You're still in your
first year, aren't you?
Yup.
How long have you
been in the first year?
Five!
But now that you're
here Ms. Gold medal...
...make me clear my First Year?
Great!
Now l also have to bear the
responsibility of making you pass exams.
Of course!
Surya Chauhan! You lied to me!
That's a real Eid union.
Shut up! Put your guns down!
lf these jerks stay alive...
...their love story will mark
the end of our political careers.
Let's nip this now...
...before the flame of
their romance spreads.
Together if we surround them...
...they'll be cornered
and finished in minutes...
...let's go!
We'll head towards
the Science section...
...you guys come from
the History section...
Another good has
come out of our love...
...even these enemies
have formed a partnership.
Parma give me a gun.
Parma!
How dare you Shadaab!
Joya! Forget it, let's go!
The Love-rebels.
Parma...are you alright?
l'm Fine! Fine!
Let's go!
Run!
You bloody traitor!
They're in here, in this room!
They've gone up!
Damnit!
Has the entire Almore
come together to see us off?
Go home! lt's not like
we are leaving for ever...
...when you all have
calmed down we'll return.
Call the cops.
To kill us and declare
it an encounter death?
Your dad must have
filed a case against me...
...claiming you're a minor,
that l've kidnapped you...
...and raped you!
We'll become 'breaking news'.
But don't worry, l
won't let them get to us.
Among the lawful,
And the lawless,
Those that were
Among the thousands.
Love-rebels,
The Love-rebels,
Where are they now?
Love-rebels,
The Love-rebels,
Give me some bullets...
...quick!
Don't be stingy...
l've given you all l had left.
Parma...
...how much do you love me?
This is not the time...
Tell me...
l can give up my life for you...
Can you take my life instead?
Have you lost it?
lnstead of them killing us,
l'd rather we kill each other.
Didn't your mom always say,
What good is losing and dying?
Joya...l'll kill these
assholes in a jiffy.
ln five minutes we'll
get to the station...
...ten minutes we
will be on a train...
...we'll leave Almore far behind...
...far away from
your Abbu, my Dadda...
You become an MLA...
...l'll open a shop, we'll
do something together...
...there will also be kids...
...little Joya, little Parma...
...don't worry.
Forget kids...
...or we'll have to teach them to
find love within their community.
lt'll be a mess all over again...
...if they fall in love
outside the community.
We'll give them the freedom...
...to love who ever
and how ever they want...
...true love.
Pull the trigger...
l can't kill you, l love you...
That's why l'm asking you to do it...
No Joya!
l want to die by love...
...if they manage to kill
us then their hatred wins.
We're love-crazy...
...and we have to
make love victorious.
Come on, pull the trigger!
Dont laugh!
Don't you laugh you jerk!
Uncle...they're dead...
...that's the end of Parma and Zoya...
...lets go.
You're a bloody fool!
Your father is a bloody fool!
Your father's father is a bloody fool!
Your father is an ass!
You are an ass, you idiot!
You're the world's
biggest lizard you idiot!
You're a dog! your father is
a dog! you are a mad dog...
You are a witch!
Your mother is a bloody fool...
Not of the earth, nor of the sky,
lnfinite unto themselves.
The Love-rebels...
Among the lawful,
And the lawless,
Those that were
Among the thousands.
Love-rebels,
The Love-rebels,
Where are they now?
Love-rebels,
The Love-rebels,
Among the stars,
Among legends,
Those that were found
ln poets' renditions.
Love-rebels,
The Love-rebels,
