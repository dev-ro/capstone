2204 A.D.
THE SEA OF OKHOTSK
That's it?
Yes, that's King Ghidorah.
It's a huge beast.
It has two heads, as well.
No, it originally had three.
Three?
During a fight with Godzilla, King
Ghidorah lost one of its heads.
King Ghidorah and Godzilla
fought each other?
Yes, in the 20th century.
GODZILLA vs. KING GHIDORAH
(GOJIRA VS. KINGUGIDORA)
1992 A.D.
TOKYO
UFO Above Tokyo?!
Are you awake?
Yes, very much.
Did you see the UFO?
I went to bed early,
so I missed it.
But I read about it in
all of the newspapers.
This time, it was for real...
All of the major papers couldn't
explain it, unlike the other times.
It seems like that...
We're putting something about
it in our next issue.
What do you think you
could write for us?
Hey, ask Mr. Yaoi,
He's your expert!
I've already told you I'm
fed up with this stuff!
From now on I want to be a non-fiction
writer who writes about human affairs.
It was your book on ESP
that made you rich!
You're a pest!
Anyway, I'm more interested in...
...the old man in Hakata,
under the UFO picture.
Under it?
In the article about Dinosaur World.
A long time ago, I saw
what a real dinosaur was!
You'll never understand what it was...
...about this great beast, but I know!
And I know that it's always watching
over us, from somewhere...
Whenever we're helpless
and desperate...
During this time of hopelessness...
The dinosaur will come to save us.
As I said once before, it happened
on that desolate battlefield...
And now, how is our country doing?
It seems peaceful at the moment...
But it won't last as we...
- Come along with us!
Wha... What are you doing?!
Ask yourself, today!
Lagos, you say?
It's just a small island between Luol
and Quajalein, in the South Pacific.
And, that's where you
saw the real dinosaur?
When we landed on Lagos Island,
many of the soldiers saw it.
The dinosaur then came to protect us, when
the American Navy invaded the island.
Protected you...?
In February, 1944...
... our Luol and Quajalein forces were
completely destroyed by the American Navy.
But our garrison, stationed
on that small island...
... in between the two,
had managed to survive.
You mean to say, the dinosaur
fought off the American Navy?
That's what happened...
Unbelievable...
But, why?
I guess I should have said that it
was protecting its own island.
It tried to be gentle at first...
Then it suddenly became wild.
Wild?
The dinosaur scared the hell out of the American
Navy, and they ran as fast as they could!
Naturally, Japan Headquarters sent a ship
to retrieve the survivors of the battles.
Thanks to the dinosaur, we were
able to return to our homes in Japan.
I've never heard
anything about this...
This Lagos Island, are there
any records of it?
You'd think so...
Our other garrisons fought
to the last man.
How could they report to our people
about the total defeat of the units?
This is the radar data
from the S.S. Takatsuki...
... recording the movement of the UFO.
The craft disappeared from
the radar near Mt. Fuji.
The UFO was spotted by several
radar systems at the same time.
Our radar systems are ready
to triangulate its position...
...should it appear again.
Please focus your
attention on this screen.
This photo was taken by satellite.
As you can see, this is neither
an airplane nor a meteorite.
A real UFO...
It cannot be anything else.
We received another
report this afternoon.
It is from Miki Saegusa,
of our Godzilla Team.
I'm Miss Saegusa...
Please observe the satellite image
I'm bringing up on the front screen.
This island, in the Japan Sea, is where
Biollante clashed with Godzilla.
Even after 1000 days...
... Godzilla's energy was still weak
from the anti-nuclear bacteria.
But then yesterday...
Please take a look at...
...the satellite image of that area.
That's...
Another UFO.
- It may be stationed there.
It might have started from there.
We've analyzed the satellite image...
It is the same UFO.
What do you think?
Does Godzilla have
something to do with it?
No, we do not know
its intentions.
We can't tell, yet.
The bones retrieved by
the Japanese vessel...
...must have come from a Plesiosaur.
They found a Plesiosaur
in New Zealand, in 1977?
Everyone thinks dinosaurs are
extinct, but I don't believe it.
Then you think...
I believe the man's story.
It may not be a Tyrannosaurus...
...but I think he really saw a dinosaur
on the Marshall Islands, in 1944.
If what the professor
said is true...
...will you be leaving
today to find it?
No. In my opinion,
I don't believe it's there.
Not there?
What, did you find something?
The H-bomb?
They tested at Lagos in 1954.
The dinosaur was affected
by the radioactivity.
And then...
The Lagos dinosaur became Godzilla...
What's that?
Chopper Two, what is that thing?
Let's move in closer.
Roger.
What's wrong, recon-team?
We are beginning the
investigation of the crash.
What's that?
What's the matter?
What do you see?
It was reported that two helicopters
went down near Mt. Fuji last night.
Some say the UFO that also disappeared
around Mt. Fuji, may have attacked them.
We have with us, Mr. Yaoi,
a renowned UFO expert.
Good morning and
welcome to our show.
Can you tell us what
you think of this?
Good morning...
The truth is, UFO's and military aircraft
disappearances almost go hand in hand.
For example, on November 16, 1988...
You want me to do a
space story this time?
Yes? Yasuaki Shindo?
I know him...
The head of the Teiyo Group.
And he owns Dinosaur World, as well?
What else do you have on him?
What, he was on Lagos?
Yes, he was Major Shindo,
of the Lagos garrison.
Then Shindo must have seen
the dinosaur as well.
What, a real dinosaur?
You think...?
Even though I may be an expert on
dinosaurs, I have yet to see a live one.
Not even with your
patrol on Lagos Island?
Lagos?
I believe that there
was one there in 1944.
Mr. Shindo!
I have to go to Kyushu for a
very important meeting.
I've wasted enough time here.
Ten years ago...
Maybe nine...
The Americans finally admitted they
tested H-bombs near Bikini Island in 1954.
The radiation may have turned
the Lagos dinosaur into Godzilla!
I think that's what happened...
So, it may have become Godzilla?
In comparison to a Tyrannosaurus,
its head is slightly smaller.
The strength of the American bomb
might have changed its face and paws.
Changed it from a Tyrannosaurus?
It is possible, that it may
have become Godzilla.
So, Shindo had this
picture all this time?
Yes, he didn't let
anyone else see it.
To think, that the man who
rebuilt Japan's economy...
...was saved by a dinosaur.
"We've come to speak
with the Japanese Authorities."
Did you received this message?
Yes, the message was
received at 10:00 hours.
I wonder if they'll show?
Gentlemen, the UFO!
I'm Security Agency Chief, Dobashi.
I'm the head physicist of the Ultra-Science
Institute, Fujio. I welcome you to our planet.
I'm Wilson.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Glenchico.
I'm Emmy Kano,
a Japanese national.
I would shake hands,
but we're only an image.
An image?
We are projecting the image of the three of
us from a television-comm in our spaceship.
3-D Television?
That's correct. It was
invented in the 21st century.
The 21st century?
We went through a time-warp
from the 23rd century.
To be exact, the year 2204.
We were sent by the Earth Union.
Then, this UFO is a...
You would call it a time machine.
To us, we call it Mother.
A time machine, you say?
It will be invented 200
years from now, in the 22nd century.
Could this be true?
I understand, people
from the 23rd century.
Well then, how may I serve you?
At this same time, tomorrow, I would
like to speak with your Prime Minister.
Will you be able to arrange it?
I understand.
How would you like us to
transport you there, tomorrow?
No, tell us where the meeting is, and
we will show you how we travel.
Teleportation...
They didn't say why they
came to the 20th century...
The truth behind
the time machine is...
...that we were assigned by the Earth
Union to minutely change certain incidents.
Incidents that will be
catastrophic to the 23rd century.
We came to 20th century Japan...
...because in the 23rd century,
Japan no longer exists.
That's ridiculous.
How does this happen?
By nuclear pollution...
In the 21st century, Godzilla will
revive once again and destroy Japan.
Is it destroyed...?
Of course...
But in the process, destroyed nuclear plants
will spread pollution throughout Japan.
The damage to Japan forces
everyone off the island.
This is horrible...
Could Godzilla do that?
Unbelievable...
We were sent here to save
Japan from this tragedy.
To save us...?
Well, how can you do that?
We will get rid of Godzilla.
It's all within this book.
It's ready!
Yes, this is Terasawa.
Yes...
I'm a writer of non-fiction stories.
With whom am I speaking?
The Internal Security Agency?
The... The prime minister
wants to see me now?
You too, Professor?
I'm sorry to have called
you so late at night.
Please come in.
This is... the book I've written?
No, I mean the one I'm writing now.
This is the one with
Professor Fujio's interview?
Yes, this is the one.
If I haven't finished it yet,
how did it get here?
Did the people who came through
the time-warp bring it here?
Yes.
All of this is hard for
me to believe...
According to this book...
...Godzilla was a regular dinosaur
on Lagos Island in 1944.
In 1954, the H-bomb was
tested off of the Bikini Islands.
And therefore, the radioactivity
made it grow larger and violent.
They recently went and analyzed Godzilla,
checking its bone and cell structure...
...with their computers.
And, my deduction was...?
They have confirmed it,
within a 2%% % difference.
In conclusion, if the dinosaur had not been
near Bikini Island at the time of the explosion...
...Godzilla would have
never been created.
So, that's what they think.
Our country would not endure
anymore of Godzilla's destruction.
Incredible...
Go back in time to the dinosaur?
Yes...
They plan on using their time machine...
...to go back to Lagos Island in 1944.
They'll teleport the dinosaur to a safe place.
Godzilla's history would
never have happened.
The people from the future
say it will save Japan.
Amazing...
No, no... There's a lot
more to this...
They want to take some people
on their expedition.
They have decided upon three people.
The author, Mr. Terasawa.
The dinosaur specialist,
Professor Mizaki.
And a leading member of our
Godzilla team, Miki Saegusa.
Please continue straight.
Please turn left.
Come in.
Please be seated.
Here.
We would like to thank the Japanese
government for their assistance.
We would also like to thank you
three, for your participation.
Our Japanese National, Emmy, and
Android M-11 will go along with you.
Android?
Is... he a robot?
Yes...
He looks like a human!
In his appearance, but his technical ability
is outstanding, far better than ours.
This trip will be perfectly safe,
as long as he is with you.
There are some that know the Lagos
dinosaur much better than we do.
They actually saw the dinosaur...
...and they are still alive today.
Why did you choose Terasawa and myself?
It's a problem with time-warps.
You see, two people of the same
identity cannot occupy the same space.
For example, if we took
Mr. Shindo with us...
...50 years in the past, they would
be at the same place and time.
Therefore, one of them
would have to vanish.
Exactly...
We're going to ride in that?
I wonder if I can be replaced!
Since you're from the future,
can I ask a question?
What do you want to know?
My book, did it
become a bestseller?
Not on any of the
records that I've seen.
Oh, really...?
I'm sorry about that.
They're called, dorats.
Oh, they're cute!
We are preparing to depart.
Crew, please report to your posts.
They were created by humans interested
in the development of new life forms.
They've become a popular pet.
They can sense their master's
emotions through empathy.
The dorats are coming too?
If we happen to become adrift in
time, they'll be happy to cheer us up.
I hope that doesn't happen to us.
It's a joke!
We're leaving...
Have we arrived at the
proper coordinates?
No mistake. February 6, 1944,
on Lagos Island.
Really?
There's no doubt,
we're back in time, huh?
We're in the middle
of the Pacific War.
Tell the commander we
can't get through!
All communications are cut off!
I understand!
Commander!
Are we safe here?
Twentieth century weapons
can't hurt this ship.
Emmy, I'll check the exterior.
He's nuts! Can't he tell
there's a war out there?
It's alright for M-11!
What you heard about Luol
and Quajalein is true?
All 6,600 soldiers gave their lives in service.
This has been confirmed already!
Do not lose control!
We will follow in their steps, and launch an
all-out attack at dawn upon our enemies.
Zoom.
We will be successful! Believe in our
victory, and fight for your country!
Yasuaki Shindo!
He looks so young.
Incredible!
Our struggle will help Japan to win
someday! You must believe that!
Charge!
A dinosaur?
Amazing!
Incredible...
It's happening!
I don't believe it!
Shall we go?
Commander!
That's Godzilla!
I'm sure of it!
Yes, it's as we thought.
Later it will be our job to send it
away, using our teleportation system.
Let's go to that particular day.
Attention!
We regret that we must
leave behind the savior...
...who killed so many of our enemy.
Forgive us...
Unfortunately, there is
nothing we can do!
We have no means to
carry you to safety.
We hope your wounds
will heal quickly.
We, the Lagos garrison,
will never forget your sacrifice!
We will never forget...
Commander!
The boat is leaving.
Present arms!
At ease!
Company, let's go.
Right face!
Forward march!
They thought that it
was going to die...
Who would have thought that ten years
from now, it would become Godzilla?
How do we know that the dinosaur...
...would not be better off,
if it died right here?
History has no room for sentiment.
Well, let's get back to work.
Fortunately, the dinosaur is immobile.
Most animals are difficult to move...
...but this one's teleportation
will be fairly easy.
We did it!
Incredible!
Where are the dorats?
M-11, time warp.
How was it?
Was it difficult?
No, it was easy.
Emmy and M-11 did it all.
For me, it was a great experience
to be able to go along.
The dinosaur's teleportation?
Perfect.
So, what's happened to Godzilla?
It's gone...
I was informed of it by Mr. Fujio.
It is reported to be
buried in the Japan Sea.
Godzilla is gone from history.
Yes... So far, it is as we planned.
So far...?
Did anything go
wrong with the plan?
Godzilla was destroyed,
but King Ghidorah has appeared.
King Ghidorah?
We've finally got rid of Godzilla...
...but it seems that King Ghidorah
was born at the same time.
The same time?
Could this be a
relative of Godzilla?
We're not sure yet...
But, King Ghidorah is
heading for Japan.
Without Godzilla, we could
be in great danger.
Sir!
King Ghidorah is coming this way!
Today, King Ghidorah attacked Japan...
It has attacked the outskirts of Kyushu
and is not flying in any particular direction.
The government has asked that
you take shelter immediately.
Sir, are you okay?
It has destroyed all
that I've built!
I will not forgive you, you monster!
The dorats...?
You're saying that they were
exposed to the Bikini H-bomb test?
And the radioactivity made them
grow larger and more savage-like.
I think Emmy released the dorats
intentionally, for that purpose.
It's possible that the
three dorats merged...
...in order to become
King Ghidorah.
Then King Ghidorah was brought here
by the people from the 23rd century.
But...
Why would they create King Ghidorah,
and use it to destroy Japan?
The computer has
calculated correctly...
You took the three dorats there.
And now they've become a powerful
monster, equal to Godzilla.
King Ghidorah is our responsibility.
We have to control it.
The dorats react to sound. We think
that may be our only problem.
But I believe it can
be controlled, M-11?
Kyushu is finished...
Next, head north.
North?
Destroy Hokkaido.
You plan to destroy all of Japan?
Tokyo will be spared...
We will give them plans
to build a new Japan.
No!
What...? The moment you see
your country in peril...
...you decide to forget our mission?
I agreed to come and warn the
people of the 20th century.
This isn't a warning of a
threat, it's blackmail!
You always do this.
Where did you go?
Good news...
We're publishing your theory on Godzilla.
We've even come up with a name for it.
The title will be,
"The Birth of Godzilla",
I would like to talk
to you about it.
It will be a big hit!
If it does, will you marry me?
Please give me a call.
I already know the title's name.
The publishing date too...
How about a bestseller
about time machines?
That's against the rules...
The Equal Environmentalists of Earth?
We're a grass-roots group wanting
to equalize the power of the nations.
Many people from around
the world joined us.
I want to see people, both modest and
aggressive, live in peaceful harmony.
To make this happen, we stole several
of the earth's existing time machines.
Why would you do that?
The truth is, Godzilla didn't
destroy Japan in the 23rd century.
Well, what about Japan's
radioactive pollution?
It's a lie...
However, in the 21st century,
Japan will become incredibly rich.
It begins to buy whole
continents, one by one.
South America, Africa...
It turns out that in the 22nd century...
...America, the Soviets and China
are no longer world powers.
Incredible... So now they want to
stop Japan before it becomes too big?
Why didn't they do anything
in the 21st century?
Nuclear weapons were completely
banned in the 21st century.
None of them had the
resources needed to stop Japan...
...not even the Earth Union.
So Wilson thought...
...if there was another monster, other
than Godzilla, in the 20th century...
...Japan would be destroyed.
We will use our computer to end this, if the
Japanese government agrees to our terms.
If Japan agrees to
their demands...
...we'll be nothing
more than puppets!
This is real purpose of
their visit to our era.
But if we don't listen to them,
King Ghidorah will destroy Japan!
Our armed forces are useless
against King Ghidorah.
Professor Mizaki...
Is it possible for us to turn the dinosaur
in the Bering Sea into Godzilla?!
Past experience says that we can...
Both King Ghidorah and Godzilla were
affected by the Bikini Island nuclear tests.
That's good, but how do we
get the nuclear weapons?
The Teiyo Group owns a nuclear
sub with nuclear missiles on board.
Of course, we don't have
it in Japanese waters.
She's docked in a country
in Southeast Asia.
A corporation,
owning nuclear weapons!
We do have missiles
on board the sub...
...but they're not
really nuclear weapons.
We have been using them as
shelter for Japan's nuclear waste.
So, you think the radiation from
the missiles will revive Godzilla?
You're insane!
We finally got rid of it, and now
you want to bring Godzilla back?
Does the government have a better idea to
eliminate King Ghidorah? Do you, Tobashi?
None of you understand...
At one time, it was my savior.
You felt Godzilla?
Sometimes when I close my eyes, I get
a flash of Godzilla moving in my mind.
The same thing happened two days ago!
Unbelievable...
Godzilla doesn't exist anymore.
The Bearing Sea dinosaur is what you
probably saw. It had to be the dinosaur...
It is possible that nuclear
energy might be there...
A shipwreck loaded with
nuclear missiles...
...or a spill of nuclear waste.
It's possible...
NUCLEAR SUB SINKS
IN THE BERING SEA
This is it!
It says that the
ship was never salvaged.
Are you leaving?
After all I've done for you...
Won't you tell me what
you're working on?
Of course...
The birth of Godzilla.
Really?
So, you think Godzilla
has already revived?
I don't have any proof yet, but...
I'd like to meet the idiots who want to
use their nuclear submarine on Godzilla.
They are believing in lies.
In the 23rd century, the Teiyo Group
has grown into a huge corporation.
They've become the largest in the world.
It's Godzilla...
It's moving.
This is an infra-red
image from our satellite.
As you can see, Godzilla
is in the Bering Sea.
Where are you going?
I'm going to talk to Shindo.
I don't want him to bring back Godzilla.
I'm going, too!
Get out of here!
Hey, look out!
This can't be!
What's he going to
do to my car?!
Stop that!
Who does he think he is?
Stop! You're no match for him!
Emmy, but this guy is...
He is a robot...
He's here to take me back.
Welcome back...
We know you went to contact your Japanese
friends, in regards to what has happened.
Then why did you let me go?
We wanted to see how the
Japanese government would react.
They're still looking
for an answer...
You always were the best
at sneaking around!
So, what are they planning to do with us?
What will they use to resist us?
Anything!
They're not that stupid to lay down for
you just because you're from the future.
I suppose, but...
Well, I thought it
would come to this.
You thought it would?
There is a nuclear sub
in the Bearing Sea...
It wouldn't be too long before
they decide to recreate Godzilla...
...from the dinosaur that still
roams those waters.
We're presently off
of the Kamachatka coast...
... heading for the Bearing Sea.
Operation G, roger.
Well, how do you feel?
What...?
What's that ahead of us?
Emergency! Emergency!
Chief, what's the matter?
What's wrong?
Come in! Come in!
What...?
She sank?!
Godzilla destroyed the nuclear sub?
You want me to go to the
Okhotsk Sea with Miss Saegusa?
I understand...
Well, we'll go together and...
On second thought,
I won't be able to join you.
This is...?
They're giving this to the Japanese government.
It's an orbital computer guard.
I thought it was still a dinosaur.
Godzilla is back with us again.
Chitose Air Squadron, scramble!
King Ghidorah is
passing Erimo Point!
Target in sight!
Prepare to engage!
Target locked!
Fire!
Cougar One, no damage!
I'm disengaging!
It's catching up!
I can't shake it!
Fighter one, everyone disengage!
Such old fashioned weapons
are no match for it.
They should quit while they're ahead.
It's easier just to give in to our demands.
What is this?
What?
It's even bigger than before.
7th Air Squadron...
- Roger!
Proceed to scramble!
It's grown larger...
It was created by modern nuclear energy,
not the earlier versions, like the Bikini bomb.
It absorbed the energy from
the nuclear sub, as well.
Godzilla has come back to life...
Unlike our century, nuclear
energy is everywhere.
We should have realized, no matter
where we teleported the dinosaur...
...Godzilla's birth was inevitable.
Our plan would have
worked out perfectly...
This is another age. The people
of this age are still savages.
Bring in our monster!
Let it fight Godzilla!
King Ghidorah...?
Once again, it will fight
to save us all.
Fire, King Ghidorah!
As long as King Ghidorah
is under our control...
No matter how large it is,
Godzilla is finished!
Godzilla...
Godzilla is losing!
King Ghidorah is winning!
The computer systems are failing.
Soon, the time control
will automatically...
Emmy?
You bastard, what did you do?
Your computer present to the
Japanese government...?
I've destroyed it!
What did you say?
So, you think you've won?
We don't need computers or
King Ghidorah anymore!
Godzilla will do our work for us!
You nuclear fanatics have
made a new Godzilla...
...and in the 21st century,
it will destroy Japan!
Thanks to you,
Japan has no future!
Our work here is done... We'll soon
be returning to the 23rd century.
You did not know this...
...but we have a device that will return
us home in case of an emergency.
Twenty minutes after
the alarm sounds...
...the time control activates automatically.
We'll all return to our time...
You're unforgivable!
Emmy!
Don't you get in my way!
Let her go!
Emmy!
Time warp in ten minutes.
Time warp in ten minutes.
Did we make it in time?
We can't let them get back
to the 23rd century!
Time warp in five minutes.
Time warp in five minutes.
Start teleportation...
We did it!
Did we time warp?
Not yet.
Well, where are we?
King Ghidorah may be
defeated, but Godzilla...
It's not the dinosaur we knew...
Shindo didn't account for this.
It looks like it's up to
your department now.
Well, excuse me.
Is this your idea of
a savior, Shindo?
Ninety-one percent...?
Is this thing certain that
Godzilla will hit Tokyo?
If M-11's computer simulation
says it will happen...
...you can be sure Godzilla
will be there.
I'm certain Godzilla will attack Tokyo.
Just as Wilson said it
would happen to Japan...
Godzilla's in Sapporo!
This is an emergency!
Godzilla is approaching Sapporo!
It is urgent that people make
their way out of the city!
This is an emergency!
Target in sight! Fire!
We've lost.
We are no match for it!
Raise King Ghidorah
from the ocean?
Yes...
Would it be possible to revive
it in he 23rd century?
You mean, revive it in the 23rd century,
and then bring it back to the 20th century?
Can King Ghidorah survive under
the water until the 23rd century?
We'll turn it into a cyborg
if its cells survive.
With the cold temperatures
of the ocean, it's possible.
How about it?
Of course, we can do it.
I was built in the same way.
Well...
Be sure to come back.
I'll come back...
I happen to like this era.
Really...?
You like our era?
I'm not lying.
Then, why?
Because you're from this era.
2204 A.D.
THE SEA OF OKHOTSK
King Ghidorah and Godzilla
fought each other?
Yes, in the 20th century.
Two hundred years?
I don't think it survived.
I hear it!
Not very strong, but
its heart is beating.
Salvage it, please.
What do you plan to do with it?
I'm going to revive it.
Are you going to turn
it into a cyborg?
You're still trying to
save that poor country?!
Don't you remember that it was destroyed
by a monster after years of vain prosperity?
Please give them one more chance!
They are my people...
Alright, you can do it.
1992 A.D.
TOKYO
Tokyo will be invaded by Godzilla today.
For your own safety...
Won't you stop?
This place is off limits!
That's why I'm Japan's Peter Arnett.
I report from wherever there's a fight.
Do you plan on fighting Godzilla?
Come on!
- Right.
How long until it reaches Shinjuku?
It should be there within the hour.
Colonel, the evacuation is complete.
The city's destruction is inevitable.
Yes, its destruction was a
necessary sacrifice.
But...
This will ruin our country!
You have a phone call.
What is it...?
Mr. Shindo?!
What...? You're still in
your office in Shinjuku?!
Godzilla is heading your way!
I understand...
...but it's okay.
Let me have my way, please.
I almost lost my life
on Lagos Island.
The dinosaur there saved me...
This land of prosperity I've created...
...is being destroyed by the same
dinosaur that I turned into Godzilla.
I'd say it was ironic...
Mr. Shindo!
Shindo's been killed?
Then...
Shindo is...?
Yes...
It's a shame... What was
that dinosaur to him?
Emmy...
Was it an impossible task?
You did it, Emmy!
Computer M-11, here we go.
Well, how is this?
You idiot, run!
Closing in on Godzilla.
Emmy, be careful.
Emmy, go!
Hurry, get out of there!
Emmy, what's wrong?
Emmy, the Godzilla grip is set!
I understand!
I did it!
Emmy, you don't have any time.
My systems will not be able to
withstand another blast from it.
I understand.
Emmy...
Thank you, Emmy!
I'll have to visit you in spirit,
200 years from now.
Terasawa, I didn't want
to tell you this...
But you are my
Great-Great Grandfather...
Emmy, ten seconds to time-warp.
Goodbye, my country.
