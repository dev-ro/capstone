Imagine you're at a party.
Okay, fine.
You're in a lot of hurry.
What next?
Never late for a party, huh!
At the party, you bump into two girls.
Twins. Gorgeous kind.
I am always surrounded by females.
The only way to tell them apart is one
is wearing lipstick and the other isn't.
I see...
So which one will you take home?
The one with the lipstick
or the other one?
I'll take the one wearing
the lipstick...
...so I can flaunt the mark
at the end of the day.
Use the dipper.
Faster man...
Use the dipper.
Faster. Faster.
Faster.
Do you own the road?
Bloody idiot...
Are you hurrying to your mothers
funeral in that piece of tin?
He's lost it.
Says...piece of tin...
But you know what...
I'll take the other one home.
Why?
Because the one wearing lipstick
has already made up her mind.
She already has plans for the night.
Her intentions are not pure.
But the one who isn't
wearing lipstick...
Oh, man... pilot.
Overtaking...
The thing about Pooja Chawla is...
I remember each and everything about her.
I've no memory of
Pooja Chawla at all...
...except for the pink shirt,
you used to wear.
She made me wear that pink shirt,
remember.
You looked like Pink Panther
in that shirt.
Pink Panther.
I looked handsome.
And one needs personality to carry
a pink shirt, and that's me.
People used to call you
Pinku Handsome.
Buzz off.
Whose that up ahead? See...
Seem to be cops.
Can't see...
Buy something pink for him.
Pinky?
Yes, I am Pinky.
Table for two in the name
of Parichay Aggarwal.
Sure, ma'am, please come.
PROMISED.
"The number you're trying to call
is currently not reachable."
"Please try again..."
PARICHAY ARE YOU COMING?
Sandy Walia.
Purva Reddy, Business Times.
Hi...
I did your interview for the BT Youth
Icon Awards.
Here's my card.
Thank you.
So congratulations.
Parivartan Bank is the story.
And Parichay Aggarwal,
if you can get an interview with him.
You know, Purva, Parichay and media,
you know how it is.
He's a bit of a recluse.
Excuse me, sir.
Stag entries are not allowed.
Let me in.
Sir, no stag entries allowed.
Let me in.
You let her in. Let me too.
The separate rule for males, sir.
What have guys done to you?
Let me in.
- What's the matter? What is it?
- See that guy just went in.
Stay in your limits. Haryana Police.
All good?
Yeah.
When I met you earlier in the evening,
I texted my editor, Aparna Sikand.
She's thrown a party
at her farmhouse.
So is so keen to meet you.
She's even put you on the guest list.
- It's just 10 minutes...
- Yeah, I know the place.
Yeah...
Gullu Sikand is a client of you.
You can't go in.
Keep your hands to rs.
Try to understand...
I am on an official Police business.
What stags? I've to go inside.
You think you can come?
Aah...
I can't believe someone
kept you waiting.
Where's your car?
I'm not driving these days.
So excited about this.
Jai Hind, madam.
Satyendra Dahiya, Haryana Police.
- Hello, you can't talk to the ladies...
- Hello.
Madam, Parichay sir sent me...
He's sent a car and asked me
to pick you up.
Is he with you, ma'am?
Yeah-yeah, one second.
Who sent you?
Ma'am, Parichay sir did.
He's very sorry.
His meeting at the Ministry
took longer than extended.
There's a network problem out there.
He's sent a note for you.
He spared no effort.
GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. TAX RESEARCH
UNIT. WITH FIN SEC SORRY. SEE YOU.
Sir, I've picked up the baggage
and en route.
The car has only four wheels,
how fast do you think I can go.
Yes, sir, I've crossed...
I'll be there soon.
TYAGI SIR.
Own the road. Own the road.
Bloody idiot...
Are you hurrying to your mothers
funeral in that piece of tin?
Dude, hello...
Listen, you cannot do this.
We're on the highway.
Please hang and drive properly.
It's not my fault, madam, people
don't respect the Police anymore.
They treat us like a joke.
Listen to me...
Who should I listen to?
Who do I listen to?
You, on the backseat,
boss on the phone...
...or the youth of today
who just crossed us.
Either you drive properly
or let me get off.
What's wrong?
Who are you arguing with?
How do I tell you, sir?
Did you turn your phone off?
It's already turned off.
Can you just relax, please?
I am relaxed, ma'am.
Out of the way, man.
Bring her at the barricade, son,
everyone's waiting.
On my way, sir. See you soon.
What's the licence plate number?
Pinky?
3572, sir.
Fortuner (SUV).
What...
What is all this?
Ma'am, they don't know
how to behave around cops.
They need to be taught a lesson.
Couple of smacks
and we'll be on our way.
Pink colour...
Yes, I am Pinky.
What just happened?
What happened?
Police Operation! Back!
Did you put the gun in their hands?
There was supposed to be two people...
...where did the third one
pop out from?
Who did you guys kill?
Mister...Mister...I am pregnant.
I am pregnant.
I am... I am carrying a child.
I am carrying a child...
Move inside or I will kill you.
I am... I am carrying a baby.
You're pregnant?
You're carrying a baby?
Check the report.
Forget the report. Why were
they trying to kill us? Speak.
You would've been dead.
If I hadn't given them
the wrong licence plate...
...then I would've been dead too.
What have you done?
- Boss... Boss... Boss... Calm down...
- Why were they trying to kill us?
Boss...calm down, please.
Dial 100, okay.
Stay away.
Doesn't matter what number you call,
I'll show up.
They are waiting for us
to make this movie.
Our phones must be on intercept.
If you call or log-in you'll be dead.
What is your name?
Sandy Walia.
Then who is Sandeep Kaur?
That's the name on my ration card.
This is normal with Sardars...
Who were you meeting at the club?
You went to have a drink with whom?
Who?
Friend... Friend... with my boss.
Friend or boss?
Friend and boss.
Friend or boss? Speak up.
- Friend and boss.
- I'll yank your tongue out.
- Friend or boss? Tell me.
- Boss. Boss...
With my boss.
His phone's switched off, isn't it?
When someone calls for a meeting
and doesn't turn up...
...is usually the one who orders
the hit.
"Satyender Security is very happy
that you called him."
"Satyender Security shall soon
reply to your call."
"Your call is very important
for Satyender Security."
"Please stay on the line,
and to record the song press #."
"Baby loves Bass..."
"Baby loves..."
Where is your head at?
Now prove them Pakistanis.
Jai Hind, sir...
Sir... you know, Pinky.
Yes, sir. Dahiya. Satyendra Dahiya.
Sir, he pulled a fast one on us.
Yes, sir, he gave us a different
licence-plate number...
...and I think they are trying to flee.
Sir...
No, sir, the other car...
has been neutralised.
No survivors at all.
Our orders were clear
so we left no stone unturned.
No, sir...don't...
No need to worry.
Get some sleep.
We'll deal with this by breakfast.
Okay.
Lunch at tops.
Yes, sir. Jai Hind, sir.
They change duty at 6 o'clock.
Sir...
That's when we need to get in.
You're such a nice couple.
You will have two kids.
You've become a hurdle
in someone's life.
You'll have 10 kids.
You had to be taken out of the way.
Along with me...so no one ever
finds out what happened with you.
Get lost.
You will have 100 kids.
Do you know of a place...
...where you can go and your boss
won't find out?
You're looking fabulous.
Look at you.
Aparna.
- Aparna.
- Yes.
Sandy.
Sandy...
Coming, not coming,
anyway...who cares.
She is here, that's the main thing.
I want you to meet all my friends.
- This is Reshma Punj.
- Hi...
That's the beautiful Reena Dhaka.
Famous Jatin.
That's the Maharaja of Tripura.
That's the Raja...
It was really nice meeting all of you,
but I really have to pee.
Ohh...
- That's fine.
- Nature's call.
We all go to go... it's fine.
Umm... Bag?
I've to tell you...
Blue...
Pinky...you're putting
the operation at risk.
- Pinky...
- You were going to kill me, sir.
Oh... Pinky.
You said you'll reinstate
me on duty again.
You're being sentimental
You're getting emotional.
Is the female with you?
Kill her.
Take her out.
Finish it.
I've no bullets, how do you expect me
to kill her?
PARIMAIL. WELCOME.
PASSWORD ENTERED INCORRECTLY.
Sir, she is online.
Hey...what were you doing inside?
I said what were you doing inside?
My Facebook, Email,
everything's blocked.
You logged in.
They are coming for you. Die.
Excuse me...
Excuse me, mister.
I want to get out of Delhi.
Take me to Panchkula and I'll pay you
any amount for it.
PARIVARTAN BANK. INCORRECT PIN.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.
Do you have money in any other bank?
No, we can't have an account
in another bank...I made that rule.
You made the rule, huh...
Let's go.
Huh?
I know a place where we can hide.
Come on.
- Where to?
- Just up ahead.
I could've had my life back goddammit.
My own people are out for my blood
because of you.
How long...
What?
If the oxygen is cut off for more
than 10 seconds the child can die.
Save my baby...
Save my baby, please!
You can still get it aborted.
All okay?
All fine.
We should leave.
You're carrying the boss' baby.
And you were blackmailing him
for this.
Take my advice...
and abort the child.
Compromise.
I hit you in your condition,
I'm sorry for that.
Take a cab. Bye.
Your boss is well connected.
Use head, not heart.
Sandeep, is there a problem?
The problem is Parirchay...
I've been trying to explain to you for
the past 30 minutes that I am resigning.
But you're not listening.
Hi, mom, I am going to Kolkata.
I'll be there for a few days
with Tyagi sir.
There are two pints under the bed,
in case you need them. Understand.
Ask Monty to get your pills.
And no fighting or you'll fall sick.
Understand.
I'll call you once I reach Kolkata.
Take care. Okay.
Thank you.
"Attention passengers..."
"Train no. 14624 will depart
from Platform no. 2."
Sir, where are you going?
"Train number 14624...
Chhindwara-Patalkot Express...
...is ready to leave
from platform no. 2."
"Attention passengers..."
"Train no. 14624 will depart
from Platform no. 2."
To jump in a well,
do you want to join me?
Sir, I cannot abort this child.
Try Nepal.
Get me to Nepal.
I'll pay you one million.
You don't have 5,000 on you,
and you're offering me one million.
This watch is worth 35, 000.
This dress is worth 40,000...
And this bag is worth 200,000...
advance.
As soon as I am safe, I can withdraw
cash from anywhere I like.
How long can you survive
without money?
Take me to Nepal and I'll give you
one million in cash.
And if I don't...
"Attention passengers...
train number 14624..."
Blackmail?
Sandy?
Sejal...I don't know how to say
this to you, on your first day.
The Swabhimaan scheme gets
announced in the budget speech.
An hour later she walks up to me
and demands 50 million as bonus.
I refuse, naturally.
Then you threaten me
to expose details...
...about the Swabhiman scheme
to the media and leave.
You log out of your Emails,
Facebook, etcetera and disappear.
Expose?
Our dealing with the Ministry...
Parichay...
What I don't need to know,
I don't want to know.
We contacted friends and family.
Maybe she's just had a nervous
breakdown.
She has no friends, and her relation
with her family is not too good.
No contact. She is gone.
I'll begin to explain how I know this
and you'll say I don't need to know.
I don't need to know.
If we had already refused
to her demands...
...then what will she get
from exposing us.
Revenge!
I am changing Parivartan.
Sandy was insecure about this.
She even had an objection
with your appointment.
You were on a 5-year break,
not up-to-date.
Will she focus on her child
or her career?
How much damage can she do?
"Your attention please passengers..."
Where are we going?
Pithora and from there to Nepal.
Will there be clean hotels?
Your days of clean towels
and hot water are over, madam.
Even lodges ask for IDs nowadays.
Jungles, mountains...
We'll have to stay where other
lawbreakers usually hideout.
PARIVARTAN BANK.
"Your benevolence is unmatched."
"Your grace is unparalleled."
"Your benevolence is unmatched."
"Your grace is unparalleled."
"Confer your blessings on us."
"O Goddess...bless us with your grace."
"O Goddess...bless us with your grace."
"O Goddess...bless us with your grace."
- Do you have woollen stockings?
- Yes, ma'am.
I don't have money to spend on
unimportant things.
- You buy used stuff as well, don't you?
- Yes, ma'am.
How much for this?
No one wears this out here.
Wait...wait...dear. Just a minute.
Please hold this bag.
There's nowhere to hang bag inside.
I keep telling them to put up
a hook inside, but they don't listen.
My husband's waiting for me
at the bank.
The bank's undergoing repairs
so the restrooms are closed.
Finding a lady's room out here
is quite a task.
Since I am frequent at this shop,
they don't charge me money.
I just admire the Prime Minister's
scheme for women's toilet.
He's very focused on building
restrooms for women.
Have you ever heard of it?
Normally comes during the Sandhya
Sangeet program on the radio.
Currently, they have been telling people
to drink at least 3-litres of water.
But drinking that much water...means
frequent trips to the bathroom.
Where do they expect us to go?
I'll be out soon.
Thank you very much.
Sorry, dear. I made you wait.
Not at all aunty.
Are you a tourist?
What happened?
Why are you crying?
Don't cry. Don't cry, dear.
Don't cry, child.
No...no... don't cry.
Calm down. Calm down.
Relax. Stop it.
Aunty...can I get a place to stay...
which is clean?
No one will let a girl stay out here
all alone.
Her husband's with here.
That's why I called.
Why don't you come down
and ask yourself?
What do you want me to do?
Come back?
I don't know what to do?
You tell me what to do.
I don't want to be you husband.
Why don't you get it, mister?
I am pregnant.
You're not the only one pregnant
in this country.
More than 30% of children die in their
mother's womb due to infection.
Please...I can't stay in some dirty
jungle or mountain.
My husband's coming here.
Tell him everything clearly.
Strict as a school teacher.
Honestly, she made me cry too.
You shouldn't make someone cry, son.
What did the manager say?
What can he say?
You brought our IDs with you.
Because you drink so much water
and keep looking for restrooms.
Welcome to Pithora.
PARIVARTAN BANK.
HARYANA POLICE.
Haryana Police?
Yes, Special Cell.
ATS... Anti-Terrorist Squad.
Terrorist?
Yes.
You guys have been included in the
9th-pay commission this year, right?
Well, the decision
was in our favour...
...but let's see whether
they will implement it or not.
We're just slaves.
Parivartan Bank?
Yes, uncle Parivartan Bank
customer service.
I've been assigned a survey
out here...
Ours is the same bank.
They can be such a pain.
You're married, then why job?
Mister is working, no?
These days one salary isn't enough
to make a living.
Like Rautela's daughter-in-law who...
- Can I speak?
- Go ahead.
I heard you had some kind
of a problem at the hotel.
Yes, uncle...unclean bathrooms,
dirty beds...
No clean towels either...
No hot water.
That too...
We were surviving on bananas
and no water.
And you know in my condition...
In her condition, there is a chance
she can get infected.
More than 30%...
Where are you from?
- Panchkula.
- Gurgaon.
She's from Punjab.
- Are you not?
- Yes, from Panchkula.
Half of my family consists of Sardars.
Rudrapur.
They've turned it into a Mini Punjab.
That explains the state she is in.
Why? Didn't your father
migrate here from Faridkot?
He was posted here.
In '59.
He's the one who brought electricity
to this town.
If it wasn't for him, this city
would've plunged into darkness.
What hotel?
Huh...
Pathik International.
- That one?
- Yes...
Thieves.
Exactly why we were wondering if
someone can have us as paying guest...
...then we're prepared to pay
a month's rent.
We get an allowance.
My husband would've invited you over
if we had space in our home.
Who says we don't?
We do?
The room upstairs.
Isn't that space enough?
Yeah...the room upstairs.
Our daughter visits us off and on...
Right, off and on...
It's been three years,
but did she show up?
Don't give wrong information.
What wrong information?
I was just...
Go on. Go on.
No, you say it...
See... maybe one of these
might fit you.
All this belongs to my daughter Neha.
I'll show you a picture of her.
See here...
This tap is very tricky.
If you press too hard...
the water will keep dripping.
Like this, right?
Yeah, good. Come.
Distance doesn't matter.
She said she doesn't want
to get married.
Order book. She is there.
You must switch off at 9 pm sharp.
My husband leaves exactly at 6 am
to fetch milk.
I'm always here at 6:30 without fail.
In case you need to make tea
for him...
Well...there is no need for it,
but we're obliged to help you.
You can pay 1000 per day.
You can have food with us.
Included.
Will you try the stinging nettle curry,
at night?
It's quite famous out here.
What are you?
I was just asking...
You never listen to the doctor.
And keep climbing up and down
the stairs.
Do you want me to lie on the bed
all day?
You already broke one knee,
now you'll break the other one too.
Get your luggage
from that tacky hotel.
Why don't you ever understand?
DO NOT PARK VEHICLE
IN FRONT OF GATE.
Mr. Dahiya, you want scooter?
No?
PATHIK INTERNATIONAL SHOP.
Leave that. And see here...
Doesn't matter how many trimmers
you gift him...
...he won't look handsome.
Forget it. Show me the video.
Tea or coffee.
Outside... Let's go outside.
What's the hurry?
Is all this stuff from Nepal?
It's a relation, sir.
Where can I find Nepali platter?
I wouldn't know, sir.
Might be available somewhere
around here.
This is just a gift shop.
But this is where Sonu Bhandari
got it from.
Done... it's downloaded.
Wait, let me increase the volume.
Faraar 3?
Yes, Faraar 3.
Are you a fan of Bhai's films too.
Big fan of him, he's in my heart.
Let's shake on that.
Look here... Look here...
Look at his swag.
Look at his swag.
This will go for Oscars.
Nice.
"Coming on the big screen
is my desire..."
I don't have money to give them.
When will we cross the border?
"Breaking these norms
and traditions..."
"...come in my arms
for the sake of our love."
"Or else I shall forsake this world."
You should sing on TV, sir.
Sir...did sir say anything
about reinstating me on duty?
Remember Sonu Bhandari.
Babbu Saini's shooter.
He went absconding
while he was out on bail...
...and crossed over to Nepal
via Pithoragarh.
Using fake documents
made by Pathik International.
From there he takes a flight
to Bangkok and texts me...
...you should try Nepali food
as well and join me.
I am missing you.
This is just for security.
I am sending you a picture
on whatsApp.
You just need to pick her up
and deliver.
When, how, where...I'll tell you
everything.
Female?
So?
There you are.
How are you, sir?
Who is Satyendra Dahiya?
I trained the lad, sir.
He's on suspension for a year now.
Suspension.
You guys needed someone
for this job who was expendable.
So Pinky was the best.
Pinky was ready to die.
But your girl was clever.
She took refuge in a media party.
From there she logged into her account
and knew we guys were tracing her.
I wonder what she offered our guy...
...but they were already gone
by the time we got there.
When sex gets in the equation,
things change.
Sad but true,
I can't put their pictures out
in public.
You guys always have your foot
on my tail.
All we need is a connection.
Once we find a connection,
things will be back on track...
...and it's only a matter of days.
This is a Herculean task, sir.
Tyagi, I've spoken to your boss.
You've to find them.
Sad but true.
"Stop this pretense,
and you will be summoned."
"Stop this pretense,
and you will be summoned."
You should always put the toilet
seat up before using it.
Finish your business
every morning first.
"The world is a facade,
don't trust anyone..."
We need a dictator.
India needs a hammer.
All the trains will then be on time.
Ask him if he wants pickles?
Pickles?
No, thanks.
I can manage in the kitchen, but going
back and forth isn't easy for me.
That's why I troubled you.
No problem, aunty.
Good morning, mister.
Good morning.
I have a surprise for you.
Recognise him?
Hello.
Hello.
These two didn't have a pleasant
experience staying at your hotel.
Can I speak?
Mr. Nihal is the owner...
of Pathik International hotel...
...from where you ran for your life.
And Nihal, Satyendra is head constable
Haryana Police.
Special Cell. Understand.
Yes, I could make it out
from his shoes.
We had a very productive conversation.
I always knew you were special.
And that's his wife,
Parivartan Bank.
They weren't agreeing at first.
They said that no such people
came here.
This gives the city a bad reputation,
Mr. Nihal.
He's responsible for the entire
city's reputation after all.
Pickle?
- Pickle?
- No.
Now when they are face to face,
he's admitted readily.
I do... I do...
Come with me, ma'am.
I'll give you the best rooms
in the house.
It's morning, I won't lie.
Top to bottom teakwood.
- No, I said no...
- One chance.
No.
I will look after them now.
Keep the rent thing between us.
You'll look like Chulbul in uniform.
Parivartan Bank is doing very well.
Sensex?
How many points will the sensex go up?
She is customer research.
Calls up people.
Goes to their homes for surveys.
You're asking her the wrong questions,
Mr. Nihal.
Mr. Nihal, everything depends
on the oil price index.
As long as the per barrel price keeps
falling, the market will go up.
- That's great.
- How does she know?
That's great advice.
Note it down. Or you'll be prancing
around all your life.
Take one more, son.
Any idea of the size of Bhai's biceps?
We enrolled in a scheme by Parivartan.
Swabhimaan Scheme.
I invested all our savings
in her name.
Did I tell you to?
Eat quietly.
They promised us 15% interest...
And a loan at any time
during an emergency.
I went to them for a loan.
But they are just making excuses.
This rule, that clause...
system's down.
Every time a different excuse.
Sorry uncle, but that's not my area.
So I am not the concerned person
for that.
You should concern.
If a knowledgeable person like you
talks to the manager...
...then you can be of some
help to her.
Am I right, Satyendra?
We've guests at home.
Stop it.
You keep going on and on.
It's okay to make her serve
the guests...
See if you can help
uncle and aunty...
Don't talk about things
you don't know.
Mister...he's my only son,
unfortunately.
But fortunately, he's getting married.
The cocktail party is next week.
You must come,
I won't take no for an answer.
Sister-in-law? Please...
And mister, you come over
to my shop.
We'll talk about the refund.
I'll also order that platter.
We can have lunch together.
Mind your tongue.
You're not the only one
who can be rude.
You ruined our plan.
What did I do?
First, you slept with your boss.
Then you blackmailed him.
When he came after you,
you came begging to me.
I am pregnant. I am pregnant.
Save me.
Later you made up some sob story.
Made me a henpecked husband.
And now you ask me to shut up.
You can cross over alone.
Get lost.
What do you think,
Mister, who am I?
Why were they trying to kill me?
Why did I refuse to go to the bank?
Because you're selfish, that's why?
Because the Swabhimaan
scheme is a scam.
And uncle will never
get his money back.
What do you mean?
I mean I've taken money from
thousands of people like them.
Promising them 15% interest
and emergency loans.
Then I created 400,000
fake bank accounts.
Using those accounts I took money
from the government.
Why?
Because my bank was sinking.
I had to save it.
Help me, Sandeep.
Do you know how many zeros
are in 150 billion?
That many.
This is the turnover
I brought for my bank.
This is how I saved my bank.
And even after all this,
I am wandering with you.
Because someone said...
Help me, Sandeep. And I did.
Your boss.
So you're pregnant with...
I don't care whether he knows or not.
I am alone.
I have a gold medal in Mathematics.
An MBA... And a Director.
I am not some arm candy...
And you were blackmailing
them for this scam.
Mister, I did this for my child...
We don't have an option.
But...you guys get everything.
Gold medal, higher education,
money...and yet...
We're just a number for you.
You just fit us wherever you like.
Whatever we did, we did it together.
We're both guilty.
But if I stay now, then it will be
my fault alone.
According to the contract
you owe me 320 million.
Pay me 200 now,
and 120 in next quarter.
It's not as easy as you think, Sandy?
Why? We signed a contract.
That was then, this is now.
Parichay, did you sign it or not?
We're a different company now.
The government's money is coming in.
There will be an audit.
What audit? What government?
- We have a board.
- What board?
What if I show your board how we create
a million bank accounts overnight...
...three months before
the budget speech?
What will happen to your 150 billion?
Parichay, don't act smart with me.
I know too much.
I am Sandy Walia.
Parichay.
On her last day,
Sandy ask Harshad...
Her assistant.
To give her a copy of the Swabhimaan
scheme customer database on a pen drive.
No, no, no, don't lock her
system access.
Because if she accesses her system...
...then this will be our last chance
to trace her.
And I will need the system access now.
We'll have to put her
on 24-hour surveillance.
JULIE ELLIS. SINGLE MOTHER.
Since aunty can't get up
she asked me to make breakfast.
Ask her how many pieces of bread
does each one have?
And listen...
You're making breakfast, not me.
Size is big. Taste is alright.
Nothing ever makes your uncle happy.
There's always some shortcoming.
She will make smaller portions
from tomorrow.
But after that.
Why? Don't I cook for you?
The doctor's clearly said,
cost of surgery per knee...
Uncle, how much money did you invest
in the Swabhimaan Scheme.
Four...
Forget about the loan.
Close your scheme
and get your money back.
They will try to create a problem but
legally there's nothing they can do.
Keep your IDs, and documents ready.
I'll go with you.
More bread, aunty?
Thank you.
The bank is growing.
As I told you last time,
you're like my father.
This is a high-value scheme.
And a refund is not possible, uncle...
Why? Why not possible?
Take a look at the form.
You take a look at the form.
Redemption clause, 23A.
- There is a lock-in period, uncle.
- Lock-in...
We're prepared to pay
unloading charges.
Uncle, they'll charge a fee,
is that okay?
Careful.
Okay.
Would you like tea or coffee, uncle?
No, thanks.
A little more to the left.
No, no...
Lower.
Little more to this side.
Wait... a little more down.
That's it.
Uncle, this is not under my power.
Of course, it's in your power.
- Yes, your power...
- Read the clause, 23.3.
Uncle, she makes it sound
like she made the rules.
Rule... you know...
If you refuse us, we can make
a formal complaint.
There is no need for a complaint.
This is my fault...
Uncle, your only mistake is that
you invested in this scheme.
Customer is King but rules are God.
- That's our President's motto.
- Yes...
Your President's motto?
Yes, our President's motto.
What other mottos does he have?
Uncle, can you give us five minutes?
Why...
Should I leave?
Is it something I said...
No, just wait outside for five minutes.
I'll be right out.
There is no problem, uncle.
Please stay.
No uncle, five minutes. Please.
Should I stay, or should I go?
Where is your dad?
Bro, I need some tips from you.
I can't get abs. Quit tobacco.
Hello, sir. I was waiting for you.
You're confusing man.
You're a cop,
but work like a criminal.
Currently, Nepali cuisine
is worth millions.
Can you afford it?
If you need someone roughed up,
I am your guy.
But I want passports.
Fine, I've two passports for you.
Only one.
One?
Look here.
You said quit tobacco, and I did.
See.
Keep him away from your
shady business.
One.
Where did you do your
Business Management?
Almoda.
Ma'am...
Then your scale must be
around 42-62...
Bonus and incentives around 5%.
At this pace, it will take you
10 years to become RM.
Maybe Lucknow or Kanpur...
Delhi, Gurgaon is out of the question.
Ma'am, you're from banking.
You're not closing the account because
those are the orders from the HO.
You can't give refunds.
Understanding position.
But...Sumit sir, close the account.
Give uncle his refund.
And I am not telling you to do it
for free.
Seven...
Nine...
Eight...
- Did you forget to count?
- I did nine...
After seven comes eight,
don't jump to nine directly.
Thank you. Thank you.
You convinced me to go to the bank.
The leader is quietly leading the way.
Good teamwork.
The Manager is ready to close
uncle's account.
And we can get something out of it.
Can you get me a current account?
Here's what I've to do.
I'll have to use the manager's
password to get into the system...
...and transfer some money to accounts
where we can make a withdrawal.
Of course, we'll have to pay him
some commission.
When do you people ever get happy?
What people?
You kings?
You. Uncle. My boss.
My entire brigade.
When are you ever happy?
You were blindly in love
with your boss.
And what did he do? He first used you
and chucked you aside.
How much money?
Whatever we need to cross over.
200,000 for the manager,
and one million for you as promised.

while you sway to the hip-hop beat."

"You're modern,
while I am still rustic."
"High on tequila,
you sway alone slowly-slowly."
Thank you, son,
you did a very good job.
All this must seem new to you.
No aunty, it feels like home
as Panchkula.
How's banking going?
Uncle, there are a lot of
unpaid loans.
My first impression of you
was that you're stupid.
But now I've changed my mind
about you.
Suddenly you arranged the cash.
He never listens to me.
I was so furious with your uncle
the other day.
I said that's it.
I packed my bags, put on my shoes
and walked right out.
And uncle didn't try to stop you?
He did... and let me tell you how.
He came running after me and said...
You're leaving me,
but where will you go.
And really where would I go?
There is no place.
I quietly took off my shoes
and went back inside.
I put on my shoes again.
You'll have to wear your shoes too.
I'll pay you in full
for the cross over.
And also a commission on the cash.
Just arrange for the account,
and no excuses.
Okay...
You're so confusing sometimes, mister.
I'll be right back.
How are you?
I am fine, uncle.
And how is the sensex?
Sensex is also fine, uncle.
Good.
E for Electric?
England?
Isn't that spelt with an I?
Account number.
Brother Pinky.
Wherever you are,
please come on stage.
My boy's become a big fan of yours.
Brother Pinky.
Come on.
Now he says he'll hang himself
rather than get married.
Then why are you getting him married?
Brother Pinky!
Brother Pinky!
Brother Pinky!
Brother Pinky!
Come on...
Brother.
Finally, you got some time off
from your friends.
Brother.
It's done.
No, no...
I won't take any excuses.
You've to do it.
- I'll teach you.
- You'll teach me.
My father couldn't teach me,
and you think you can.
Start the music again.

Bro...
Stop it, son. That's enough.
I don't want to get married.
I've done it all now.
I've done it all.
If you talk about dying again
I will kill you. Understand.
Don't try to be a wise guy?
If you leave...
Stop it.
No one here loves me.
I'll be all alone again.
Parichay, hi.
I think I have a lead.
Someone's transferred 1.5 million rupees
from five of our special accounts.
I know Sandy will not play
such a small game...
...but only Sandy has information
about all our special accounts, right.
The money's been transferred
to one account.
Pithoragarh. Nepal border.
- You came for the wedding.
- Let's go.
Who told you to start dancing?
Same.
Don't they know of a better way
to communicate with each other?
You shouldn't have such expectations
with people.
Expectation is equal to frustration.
You were amazing, man.
Come down to the shop tomorrow
with cash.
Get your picture taken and meet me
at Suicide Point at 8 o'clock.
Okay.
My truck will leave at that time.
You'll get the passport in Nepal.
Do I have to repeat the instruction?
What name do I put on your
Nepali Passport?
Hrithik Roshan Thapa.
Who was that? Nihal?
Are we crossing over?
NORTH INDIA SEMI CONDUCTOR ASSOCIATION
56/12 NEW OKHLA INDUSTRIAL. ND - (PIN)
Quiet. Quiet.
No one's going to hear you.
You heard me.
No one's going to hear you.
Jai Hind, sir.
Pithoragarh.
Congratulations, sir.
It's Pinky.
Smile, sir.
I can't smile. Go ahead.
The manager complained of hacking.
- Give him the phone...
- Harshad, what are you doing?
Priya, generate a new password
and send it to him.
The manager could be involved as well.
When the system's up in the evening
check all the activities and call me back.
And any clue about where
the system was hacked from?
Pathik International Resort.
Harshad, bring some water.
I see.
Don't worry
Take a selfie...with the mountains...
For Facebook.
Pinky is a naive boy.
He goes where I tell him to go.
I know where they are waiting.
And this is not a female's job.
Believe it or not.
You're going alone.
Are you sure?
Sorry, continue.
Ready?
Sandeep.
Yeah, aunty.
Uncle wants to know does
Satyendra has a licence?
Can you tell me whether this girl
ever rented a room at your place?
No, she didn't.
This one?
She danced here.
Dance?
Take a closer look.
Where was she dancing?
Here.
Here?
Her husband is a better dancer,
not her.
I'll come along too.
No...the manager is a coward.
You might scare him.
I must finish this today.
Can you ride a scooter?
I mean if I...go to pee
and don't come back.
Then don't wait for me,
go home straight.
Do you remember the address?
"Baby loves bass."
Where are you?
I am waiting at Suicide Point.
Yeah...
Okay, come on.
Okay, fine.
They are on the way.
You are getting my full cooperation.
Don't forget.
So...how are things?
Great. How about you?
Don't worry, Sumit sir.
You'll be safe once I delete
your history.
Don't worry.
Done.
I've brought your cash,
and please close the account, okay.
And hurry up.
Have you seen Jab We Met?
It's on my laptop?
Would you care to see it?
No, but you can.
Ma'am, Sandy Walia of
Parivartan Bank comes to me...
...and doesn't share a cup of tea.
That's not possible, ma'am.
You...must be mistaken.
I was before...
But who would know clause 23.3?
And the other day I saw you dancing
and it just flashed before my eyes.
I was wondering why you looked
so familiar.
Ma'am, during the orientation week...
...all my batchmates would look
at your picture for hours.
Don't be childish, Mr. Sumit.
Close the account.
Don't you want your money or not.
What is childish about it?
Did I misbehave with you?
I am just talking.
I am just talking like a gentleman.
This is unfair, ma'am.
Drink some tea.
Yeah, let's finish work first.
Why can't people have any other
relationship other than work?
I mean why can't we sit down
and talk to lighten the burden.
What do you want to talk about?
I am pregnant.
I puke every few hours.
Ma'am...the manager's room
is securely locked from inside.
You don't have to be scared.
I won't lay a finger on you.
I am not scared.
That's good.
I will tell to anyone that Sandy Walia
was here and gave me 250,000 rupees.
She transferred cash from here.
I will not tell.
Are you really pregnant, ma'am?
Yes.
I don't believe you.
Then show me your baby bump.
- And I'll be convinced.
- Excuse me.
Just...
- What are you saying?
- Just...
What are you saying?
Then you can leave.
I just want to see your beauty.
Sir, please open the door.
Ma'am, you've been making me do
so many things since we met.
I made one small request
and you're giving me attitude.
Am I complaining?
Do you want to get your job
done or not?
Sumit, please.
Ma'am, please.
You're like God to me, ma'am.
You'll be gone,
I'll close the account...then...
What are the chances of
this happening again, ma'am?
Just show me once and I'll let you go.
I promise.
And you'll close uncle's account?
God promise, ma'am.
Gentleman's promise.
Keys?
Close the account and let me go.
Stay back.
There are other changes
in the body as well.
What are you doing?
- Madam, please.
- No!
Just once...
Please...
Please, ma'am. Stop.
Please...
Keys!
Sorry, ma'am.
Sorry.
Sorry, ma'am. Sorry.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
PARIVARTAN BANK.
Yes, uncle. Hello.
Satyendra.
Did Sandeep come home?
No, I went to the bathroom, so...
She must be at the bank.
We'll be right back.
Sandeep!
Sandeep!
Sandeep!
I failed. I failed.
Is it kicking?
Let's go to the hospital...
Help!
I am okay.
Water.
Sandeep!
Yes, sir.
We've traced them, sir.
We're on location.
State Police is with us.
Don't worry, sir,
we gave them a different story.
Don't worry.
Jai Hind, sir.
She did a real job
getting you two in trouble.
Tomorrow if Kasab, Abu Salem, Dawood
come to you after eloping with a girl...
...will you offer him safe haven
at home?
Do you want to see the inside
of a jail...at this age?
Can you handle it?
You got your revenge, didn't you?
Was it her?
Yes.
Are you sure she was pregnant?
They have been lying all the time.
This must be a lie as well.
No, it wasn't a lie.
Eat something.
First, you were leaving her...
...and now you are taking
care of her in this jungle.
Are you a scientist?
Is this some kind of an experiment?
What do you know about him, father?
If it wasn't for him,
I would've hung myself.
I had even written note.
The Police officer
from Delhi...Tyagi...
I can keep him off your backs
to a certain extent.
How many have seen them in Nepal?
People see people talk,
people hear...word spreads.
How else.
This boy of yours...
who was dancing alongside them.
Did he take them across?
Do the sieve.
If you come to the party,
he'll dance with you too.
He knows only three things.
Dancing, farming, Facebook.
There's no way
he can take them across.
By the way, the local DGP
was asking about you?
Why are you here?
Why are you asking around?
No prior intimation was given.
I've good relations with him?
Shall I take you to him?
Are you still bleeding?
You can drink this.
Brother. I've some good news.
My wedding procession leaves tomorrow.
So father said you can stow away
in the truck carrying the dowry.
No one checks wedding
processions here.
He said he'll get both your passports
made tomorrow as well.
Give me a drink too.
Munna, can you take me to the place
where uncle goes to fetch milk?
There's an old couple out here...
She was helping them get a loan,
close their account.
So it's all...
And she was seen dancing
at some party.
Yeah, so there is no pattern.
Really makes no sense.
Parichay, she is pregnant.
She is in her third month.
Hello. Parichay.
I think I lost him.
I think she is having fun.
Parichay suggested her.
He came to Sandy madam's room
and said go on a holiday.
There was also some talk of money.
They made plans for a farewell dinner.
On the day of the Budget.
I was there, outside.
Dinner?
You don't know?
Sandy ma'am, Parichay sir...
Everyone knows.
Uncle, I...arranged some money
for aunty...
Here they are.
Who are you?
I don't recognise you.
Sorry, uncle.
Sorry, I know I lied to you.
I don't recognise you, madam.
- This money belongs to you.
- Madam, I...
Madam, I don't recognise you.
Uncle, if you don't close
the account...
- Uncle...
- I don't recognise you...
You won't get your money back.
I don't recognise you...
Think about your wife.
Think about your wife, uncle.
Please.
What is your...
What is my what?
Whether she lives or dies,
is my decision.
Who are you to decide?
All my life I lived proudly in that house,
and you brought the Police there.
Aunty!
If you like being a daughter
then go back to your family?
Why are you after us?
Aunty, you say...
Don't just stand there? Leave.
Sandeep, let's go.
I had brought your money.
- Yeah, Harshad.
- Ma'am, we found Sandy.
SONI BAND.
Brother, we can't go
through the vehicle route.
Police are checking every vehicle.
Then we'll mingle with the crowd
and cross over on foot.
No, no, no, brother.
Why?
Someone squealed on us.
What to do?
We don't have time?
Hello.
Hello, sir.
I've one million.
Take it. And me too.
Let the girl go.
Pinky.
The communication between us
has gone sour.
She is dead.
The body's warm and still breathing
but there's nothing left.
It's dead.
Let her go for the sake
of our relationship.
Every relationship has its limitation,
understand.
If I escape, then you'll become
Pinky instead.
Pinky.
Pinky, I can't go to Nepal.
I can't keep running anymore.
I've things to settle back here.
You go to Nepal.
Munna.
Why don't you carry out
a surgical strike...
...on the wedding procession,
with full force?
If India and Nepal go to war,
will you patch things up between them?
Next stop Katgodaam, then help her
get on the train to Delhi.
And your job's done.
The vehicle's ready.
You don't worry.
This isn't right.
Nothing wrong.
Just give him your clothes.
He looks nice without the moustache.
Looks nice without the moustache.
Local Cultural Song.
Local Cultural Song.
If someone wants to come
or go from here then...
Ma'am...
They were saying...
They are readying their guns.
Brother...
Munna's calling us. Let's go.
In case you get caught, you'll have to
be an extraordinary criminal as well.
Otherwise, you'll just end up...
...where I am now.
Head not heart.
Bye.
The wedding procession is coming.
The wedding procession is coming.
The wedding procession is coming.
Munna...I lied to you.
There is nothing between her and me.
You go.
Forget all that, brother.
If you want to live then keep dancing.
What's the news out there?
Parichay.
He's holding board meetings in jail.
He's got a conference room.
Every Wednesday the entire Parivartan
Bank goes on a tour of Tihar Jail.
Three more PILs have been filed
against him.
Counting SEBI and EOW there are
a total of 6 cases against him...
...and the High Court's verdict
is yet to come.
Sandy...your confession
rocked the government.
Why are you not filing an attempt
to murder case again Parichay?
Exposing the scam isn't enough?
It's too dry.
People need a story.
They need some emotions.
They need a story,
you need to let them know.
I mean you've lost your...
Sandy...
All clear, madam.
This came to my office.
Who is P. Thama?
It's from Nepal.
