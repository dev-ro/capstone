No!
It's all right.
It's all right, baby.
It's okay.
It's me. It's Mom.
Oh, you're okay.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, shh.
It's okay, buddy.
We're here.
You're okay.
The nightmares
were the first sign
that something
was wrong with me.
They were coming
every night.
My parents wrote them off
as raging teenage hormones.
Looking back on it now,
maybe they were right.
Thing is, a guy like me
shouldn't have been
having nightmares at all.
From the outside,
my life was a dream...
great school, great friends,
beautiful girl on my arm.
I was a quarterback
in a town
where football
was the one true religion.
Go!
Blue 45!
Blue 45!
Check! Check!
Hike!
Go!
Look at him go!
Yes!
I guess sometimes
everybody feels
like they don't fit in,
but it was becoming clearer
and clearer to me that I...
Unh!
Really didn't fit in.
What was that?
And after that night,
everyone else knew it, too.
Hey, Richards,
clean yourself up.
You watch
yourself, Brad.
Next time, 15 yards.
Come on. I slipped.
Yeah. Yeah.
I swear.
Let's go.
Run them back.
Richards!
Whoo!
Like that, huh?
Oh, I know
you like that.
Look at that.
Look at your boy.
Now, any guy
in this situation
would be experiencing
an insane adrenaline rush,
but I'm pretty sure
this wasn't normal.
I felt sick
about what I did to Brad.
It wasn't like me at all.
Everyone had questions...
Brad's parents, the police
and the principal.
But what did
he want me to tell him?
About my nightmares,
my temper on edge,
the sudden rushes
of inexplicable strength?
He was looking for
an explanation, I guess.
Everyone was,
but I could only think
of one that made any sense.
I think
I'm losing my mind.
Of course
you're not.
You're just young,
and life is...
complicated.
I mean, senior year.
Like, everything's
changing.
I'm scared, too.
Oh, Jesus.
My head is killing me.
Cayden.
Lisa, are you...
are you sure?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Ow!
Don't stop.
Oh, my God,
Cayden, no!
Don't!
No!
Lisa!
What the...
Mom? Dad?
Mom! Dad!
Wha...
Whoa, whoa.
This is 15-55.
We have
a 17-year-old girl
reporting an assault
by her boyfriend.
See signs of violence.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Stay in the car,
please.
Cayden.
It was Cayden.
Miss.
He's a monster.
So my nightmares
had come true.
I had killed the two people
I loved most in the world.
I was a monster.
And just like that...
my old life was gone.
I never knew
when I'd lose control,
so I just kept running,
moving from town to town
until time lost
all meaning to me.
You all right?
I lived in constant fear
that I'd kill again.
And then, one night,
I did.
Hey!
Hey, you want
to hang out?
I'm okay. Thanks.
Are you sure?
Handsome guy
like you,
you're a rare catch
out here.
No arguing that.
Do you need
a menu, hon?
Just a coffee. Thanks.
Lisa,
I understand you
were with Cayden
the night
of the murders.
He attacked me.
Was Cayden angry
or upset over the fact
that he was adopted,
perhaps?
What? I didn't know
he was adopted.
He never mentioned
that he was adopted?
- No.
- Funny thing was,
up until that moment,
I hadn't known it either.
Unh!
Unh!
Unh!
Oh, jeez!
Uhh!
Hey!
Leave her alone!
Turn around, asshole.
Oh, God,
please help me!
These guys are batshit!
Listen to me!
You hit her again...
and you're gonna
lose that hand.
Run, kid.
What is it, Robbie?
Kill it, Robbie!
Kill it!
As far
as a cure went,
all the books agreed
there was only one...
suicide.
And I couldn't see
what other option I had.
Of course,
that was
before I met Wild Joe.
♪ I can't sleep at night
♪ Can't face the pain
♪ I'm wound up tight
♪ All of the way
♪ Whaah!
It's a pretty tough place
to be, isn't it, killer?
I've seen tougher.
Ah, I'm speaking
metaphorically, boy...
about life.
It's hard.
Can be, I guess.
Yep. Can be.
Life is like an onion.
That's what they say.
The more you peel it back,
the more it makes you cry.
Especially when
you're afflicted.
You know...
afflicted?
Holy shit.
What do you mean,
you never knew?
Must have had some clue.
Just tell me
how to stop it.
Stop it?
Heh. Why would you want to?
So you can be like them?
Hey,
what the hell, man?
Yeah, you!
Scum like you!
Hey,
what's your problem?
Want to dance,
my card's open.
Why would anyone
want to be like that?
I can't control it.
Boy, you're
not supposed to.
You're a predator.
It's what you are.
Didn't your parents
not teach you nothing?
No, they, um...
they didn't know.
What? You're gonna
tell me, like, you were
adopted or something?
Yeah, that's right.
I was.
I would have loved
to have seen the look
on their faces
when you turned
for the first time, mate.
"Oh, he's a monster!
He's gonna kill us!
Oh, no, it's..."
Eh, none of my business.
Your real folks,
bet they're
from back east,
from the old parts
of this pitiful new world.
I thought
you had to get bitten
by one to become one.
You can do,
but the bitten ones,
they're not pure,
They're just, like,
mutts, really.
The purebred ones,
like you and me,
we're born this way.
There are others?
They're the most vicious,
secretive pack
on God's green Earth, boy.
How do you think
I got so pretty?
Shit.
Shot my mouth off
too much already.
Sayonara.
Wait, Joe, if you
know where they are,
you have to tell me
how to find them.
Get your hands
off me, boy.
I don't have
to tell you shit.
You're not
my responsibility, kid.
I don't know
anything about...
Figure it out yourself.
What I am.
I have no idea.
Joe, nothing.
I'll show you the way.
It never came from me.
You understand?
Yeah. Yeah.
Y-You got it.
I promise.
You ain't gonna like
what you find.
Oh, jeez!
Hey! What's
going on
over there?
Nothing. We're ju...
Shit!
Just keep it down, kid.
What can I get you, hon?
Beer, I guess.
Just roll into town?
Yep.
What for?
I'm sorry?
I mean, we don't
get many tourists,
being up here
in the hills and all.
It's too bad.
Seems like
a nice town.
Sure does.
Oh, hey,
you know if there's
any work around here?
Heh. Nope.
Ask him to dance.
You are new here.
Heh. Yeah.
Yeah. Heh heh.
I mean, right?
So you want to dance?
I'm not really
much of a dancer.
Oh, come on.
Any one of these guys
would love to dance with me.
I'm sure they would,
and that means
you'll never be lonely.
Fag.
Thanks.
That's great.
What's your name?
Me? My name?
I'm sorry.
Did I stump you?
No. No.
It's, uh...
It's, uh, Danny.
Daniel.
Why'd you come here,
Danny Daniel?
What? What do you mean?
I mean to a bar,
alone, at night.
Even the sluttiest
girl in town can't
get you to dance.
Oh, no,
that was tempting.
I admire a girl
who can drink like that.
Yeah? How's that?
Sloppy?
Heh.
What's your name?
It's, uh...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I stump you?
Hey.
Hey, you were
hassling my girl?
She said
you grabbed her ass.
Well, she made
a mistake.
Oh, I see.
So she's a liar
with one sweet,
squeezable ass, right?
Relax, friend.
It didn't happen.
I ain't your friend, dick.
Hey! Cut it out, Deke!
Mind your business,
Angel.
This bar is my business.
You want to get kicked out?
You can't kick us
all out, Angel.
Come on.
Okay, look,
I'm leaving,
all right?
You're damn right
you're leaving...
buttercup.
Whoo!
Come on!
Hey, kid.
I hear you say that
you were looking for work?
I don't know.
Did you?
Yep.
Danny, I'd like you
to meet my wife Clara.
Welcome, Danny.
It's an honor.
Damn!
Bull testicles.
Those rocks,
they hack my plow blades up
something terrible,
I'll tell you.
Yeah, I think
I can get it
out of there for you.
No. Don't even
think about it.
You'll wrench your back.
That's what
the bucket's for.
Well, I'll be damned.
Heh.
It really wasn't
in that deep.
I'd come to Lupine Ridge
looking for answers,
and what I found
was this place,
a farm.
Who'd have thought?
Good people with no idea
of my problems
and seemingly
no inclination to pry.
All John asked was
that the work got done.
Even if the Tollermans
had no idea what I was,
the animals sure did.
But, all in all,
things seemed pretty fine,
and for the first time
in a long time,
I felt safe.
Oh.
Uh...
hey.
New farmhand.
Uh, pardon me?
John took you on
just like that.
J-Just like what?
Is there a vetting process?
Where you from, kid?
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
Connor.
Oh, I see you've...
you've met
my new hand Danny.
Danny, is it?
Yeah.
He's my nephew
from out west.
Your nephew?
That's funny.
I saw you both at the bar
the other night.
Sure.
I was there.
I didn't see
the two of you speak.
It's a funny way
to treat a nephew.
Well, tell you
the truth,
I didn't
recognize him
at first.
Been a long time.
Guess those eyes
aren't as sharp
as they used to be.
Mm.
John, who the hell
is that guy?
Danny,
you don't
want to know.
What's wrong?!
What's happening?
Sheep need feeding.
No.
Animal.
What?
Ah, well, animals.
When things get scarce
up in the hills,
the wolves
come down here to feed.
Oh, I see.
That's what you...
That's what
you think it was?
What else could it be?
Um, that...
just like you said.
Ah, the poor
little bleater.
Ah, well,
look on the bright side.
Bright side?
Clara,
that smells wonderful.
Back with gravy.
Help yourself.
Yeah.
How often
you guys losing sheep?
Oh, it happens.
Wolves have to eat,
too, you know.
I'll take that.
Wolves.
Is that where the town
gets its name,
Lupine Ridge?
What's that?
"Lupine."
It means wolf, right?
Oh, well,
o. Actually...
it means wolflike.
What's the difference?
Ah...
Mmm.
I'm not going to do
any killing.
You not defend yourself?
Oh, I'll shoot
if I have to,
but I'll shoot to wound,
not to kill.
Tonight at 11:00,
after the discovery
of two mutilated members
of a Colorado biker gang,
bearing a grisly similarity
to the Cannibal Kid murders,
a frightened nation is
asking, where is Cayden...
Um, I'm gonna
go into town.
Well, I can see why
that would require you
to turn off the TV.
Heh heh.
I just, uh...
thought I'd
let you know.
Mm.
Hey, Cayden.
Your name's
Cayden Slaughter, right?
No, it's... Who are you?
I'm Carter Wills.
I'd be, uh,
your second cousin,
I guess.
My what?
Listen,
the others
might be too afraid
to say it,
but you have
to haul ass
on out of town, kid,
or you're gonna
get us all killed.
I think you think
I'm somebody else.
No, you think
you're somebody else.
And listen, he doesn't
know who you are yet.
Only a few of us do,
but you think
he's not gonna find out?
And when he does...
Who's gonna find out what?
What are you
talking about?
Heh. You really
don't know shit, do you?
It's Connor, man.
County Police don't even
come up here anymore.
He decides
who lives and who dies.
Yeah. He kicked
my own brother
out of town.
Oh, God.
Ah, Jesus.
So get out
of here, kid,
please.
Excuse me.
What?!
I'm allowed to have
one of these, you know.
I'm part owner here.
Stop drinking
all our beer, Gail!
Don't even know
what you're talking about.
I don't even know.
Could I just get
one of those?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.
So, back again.
Well, it is
the only bar in town.
And how do you find
our little town so far?
Strange,
like it's got secrets.
Yeah, well,
doesn't everybody?
Hey, judgy,
how 'bout next time
I tell you
when you've had...
I've had enough?
Okay.
Is she gonna be okay?
Yeah,
as okay as she gets.
How does
she keep her job?
It's tough to fire
your own sister.
Oh, so you really
do own this place.
What are you, some kind
of small-town princess
or something?
Small-town heiress,
actually.
Both our parents
are dead.
I'm, um... I'm sorry.
Both of my parents
are dead...
as well.
Well, then...
tribute to orphans.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Uh, so...
what's up, fellas?
Saw you talking
to the kid, Carter.
W-What kid?
The one Tollerman's been
keeping out on his farm.
Oh, yeah.
That asshole.
What'd you tell him,
exactly?
Tell him? Nothing.
Well, just to get out
of town, you know,
hit the road.
Why's that?
'Cause I saw
him sniffing
around Angelina.
I figured...
maybe he was
pissing you off.
So you told him about me?
Wh... No.
Ah, shit, no,
othing.
That's funny.
Thought I heard my name.
Ah, hell, no, Connor.
Hey, I just
played it off
as, you know,
small town, we don't
like outsiders.
Hmm.
I'm having a problem here,
Carter.
See, I know this kid's
from one of the old lines.
Maybe he's from here.
Maybe he's from down east,
from the Synod. Maybe.
But what I'm really
trying to figure out
is why Tollerman
took him on so quick
and also why
a useless drunk like you
would take
any interest in him.
Oh, boy.
I feel like...
secrets are
being kept from me.
No.
Listen, you know
what I know.
So you didn't tell him
anything about us,
and you got nothing
to tell me about him?
No, no. Connor, no way.
You gotta believe me.
And this
has nothing to do
with your brother Joe?
You tell me right now,
who is
this fucking kid, huh?
What's he doing here,
and can I tear
his nuts out
without facing
any backlash?
Oh, God, I don't know.
I don't.
I don't know anything.
I just tried
to get him to leave,
save us all
a bunch of trouble.
That sounds believable.
Heh heh.
So now I guess
the only thing
left to do
is to make sure
that you don't
tell him anything else
before I'm ready
to deal with him.
No, I w... I won't.
I swear it.
Now, Carter,
you know what a promise
from your family
means to me.
Gonna have ourselves
a night hunt, boys!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oww!
You know how
this works, Carter.
So run.
1, 2, 3, 4.
Ready or not,
here we come.
You smell that?
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
You smell that,
right, that reek?
Yeah.
Can you?
We're downwind.
An asthmatic with a head cold
could smell it from here.
What are you
doing out here?
They've killed someone.
I need to find out who.
Okay, you can look,
but don't make a sound.
No way.
What are they eating?
His name was Carter,
Carter Wills.
We gotta go.
Now.
They were...
They were, all of 'em...
Wolves, yeah.
Just like you.
...a star student,
a gifted athlete,
but no one suspected
the insanity
that lay within...
Great.
They're playing
that crap now.
No, son.
We had it TiVoed.
Oh, Cayden,
I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
What are you sorry about?
It's not your fault.
No, son.
It's my fault.
Ah.
This is your mother.
My mother?
Lucinda was
my sister's girl.
What a beauty she was.
We've been here
a long time,
Werewolves
of the Eastern Coast.
We came here
on the ships,
first ships.
'Course, there's not many
of the old lines left.
Most of us paired up
with the locals,
thinning the breed,
like this one here.
Too beautiful
to resist.
I'm not part
of the pack, you see.
I just like men
with chest hair.
There's two ways
to become a wolf, Cayden.
You can be born into it,
like you, me,
Angel and her sister,
or you can
be infected with it,
bitten by a purebred,
but those,
those will never
have the power
of a pureborn wolf.
They'll change,
but it's weaker, diluted.
Now, Connory Slaughter,
he is one of the last
of the purebred wolves
for miles.
All this really started
when Lucinda caught his eye.
She was a town wolf,
one of the last
of the pure lines.
In his eyes,
she was made for him.
He came in the night
and took her by force.
Lucinda got pregnant
with you.
What?
No.
John, what you're
saying is that...
that that asshole
up in the hills is...
is my father?
By blood, he is, yeah.
When her father found out
she was pregnant,
he threatened to kill her,
so we faked Lucinda's death.
I hid her away in our cellar
till she came to term.
We agreed that Connor
must never find out
about you, Cayden,
so I convinced Lucinda...
to give you up for adoption.
Brokenhearted,
she let you go.
And she killed herself
that September.
Once Lucinda was gone...
Connor got worse.
He formed a savage pack.
He bit them, changed 'em.
They moved up
into those hills there
to run and hunt and kill...
spending less and
less time in human form.
It gets into you,
you see, the wild.
So, the deal was
they'd live up there
and none of us town wolves
would interfere with them
and we would both
keep the secret
from the outside.
But now...
ow Connor's
getting older...
and he's thinking
about his legacy.
Meaning what, exactly?
Now that she's
come of age...
Connor intends
to have a son...
with one of the last
purebred wolves in town.
No.
Yeah. That's the deal.
When?
When he decides it's time.
And you're just
gonna go along with it?
I have to. If I back out,
if I try to leave,
he'll murder John, Clara,
my sister, everyone.
Jesus.
Cayden, stop.
He doesn't care
about the law.
He doesn't care
if he dies.
He'll butcher anyone
that stands in his way.
Is it what you want?
What I want?
I want to move
to a city,
live my life,
but this is the only way
to protect
the people that I love.
If I give him a son,
he'll let me go.
Then I'll be free.
A son,
like me,
and then
this whole thing
goes on and on.
Yeah. Well, it's been
going on forever.
You shouldn't
have come back here.
You're too good
for this place.
Don't say that.
Why not?
Because...
I... I killed my parents.
I don't remember it.
I just woke up,
and they were dead,
torn apart.
You know, my father,
he was
a world champion drunk,
my dad.
He killed my mom
one full moon.
He came home drunk,
angry, and he just...
When he came around
and he found her,
he cut his own throat.
Gail and I kicked it
around for years.
Was it the wolf
that killed our mom
or the man?
Or just the booze?
I don't know.
But it always seemed
to be in him somehow,
that potential
for blind murder.
The thing is
it doesn't seem
to be in you.
Well, it is.
Moonlight,
violence,
I feel it.
I know.
I can feel it, too.
But that's our
big question, right?
Is it a gift
or a curse?
So which is it?
Come on.
I'll show you.
Seeing things
the way we see them,
the scents, the sounds...
this bond with nature...
Mama always said
it was a power
and a gift.
There, you feel that?
Cayden?
So then, what do we do,
let the beast run wild,
let it kill
whoever gets in our way?
Of course not.
We use it,
learn to control it.
And we'd
only ever kill
anyone who threatens
the ones we love.
That's really hot.
Angel, that's, uh...
that's not a good idea.
Really?
'Cause it seems like
a pretty good idea.
It's been a long,
long time since...
What?
Wait. Not...
Never?
Well, no,
not never, exactly,
just rarely without...
incident.
I see.
You're afraid
the excitement,
the adrenaline
might make you
change.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay?
Okay.
So what?
I mean, if anything
were to happen,
that's how
I'd want it.
Yeah.
Hello in the barn!
Hello?
Just a sec.
Hey, John.
Hey yourself.
How's things?
Good, yeah.
Yeah. Good.
Very, very, very good.
Yeah?
I think we're all...
think we're
all pretty good.
Good. And, uh,
where's Angel?
Has she gone home?
Uh, no. Up here.
Ah.
Hey, John...
Yeah?
Do you think Clara
might have a...
a blouse or something
I can borrow?
Well, we'll see.
Clara,
take off your shirt!
Larson, just a matter
of defending ourselves.
It's suicide.
We can't fight...
We gotta do it now.
You know what they left
of my little brother?
Well...
Here's your coffee,
gentlemen.
Ah, here he is.
Cayden, these are
the town wolves.
This is all that's left
of the old lines.
And, everyone, this...
is Lucinda's boy.
I knew I knew
that scent!
I knew it
the first time
I saw him.
Didn't I say it?
We all said it, Gail.
I said it first.
Now, this is, uh,
Larson Wills.
He would be your
second cousin, I guess.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you, kid.
You know,
my little brother Carter,
he was your cousin, too.
Now he's
yesterday's dinner.
I'm sorry.
I didn't plan
for any of this
to happen.
Hear that, everybody?
He didn't come here
to kick the hornets' nest.
It just got kicked.
Cayden came back here
because he belongs here.
We all get
to pay the price
for it, Clara.
And this is
Mayor Robinson.
He's an optimist.
I'm a realist.
Connor is
getting paranoid.
If he thinks this kid
has come here to...
interfere with Angelina,
then he and his pack
are gonna come down
from those hills,
and they'll kill him,
and then they're
gonna kill us
for trying to hide him.
Maybe they won't.
Are you nuts?
This close
to the full moon?
Shit, even I can barely
keep from freaking out.
When is
the full moon?
Tomorrow night.
Halloween.
Jesus.
Well, hey,
what's more Halloween
than getting eaten
by a wolfman?
God, lighten up.
Listen, he's getting
crazier and crazier.
We got one option.
Give him Angelina,
and give him the kid.
You're a real hero,
Larson Wills.
At least Angel survives.
Don't you get that?
They're your own
flesh and blood!
No! This is
my flesh and blood.
All right,
all right.
Calm down, Larson.
Just calm down here.
Now, uh,
we like to pretend
that we have got
an uneasy peace
with Connor and
his pack up there.
Sometimes some livestock
goes missing.
Sometimes a child
goes missing...
but there's not
one of us who can't
follow that scent.
There's not one of us
who doesn't know
where that child's gone.
Yes, John, it happens.
But it's not fear
that stops us
from doing anything about it,
it's practicality.
Those guys up there
are wolves all the time.
Hell, John, some of us
ain't even changed in years.
I can't even barely grow
my sideburns anymore.
It's just a little fuzz.
He's the youngest
and the strongest.
Connor kills him,
he'll have no more reason
to come after us.
And then what? Then we
just give him Angelina?
That was
the deal we made.
The deal I made.
Well, I didn't.
Stay in your homes
tonight,
and lock your doors.
I'll take care
of this.
No, son.
Don't do it.
He'll kill you.
Maybe.
No! Cayden!
I mean he'll kill you.
Maybe I can
take him with me.
No!
John, please.
You gotta stop him.
How?
Look, Tollerman and
the others broke the pact,
brought the kid in
from the outside.
What are we
gonna do about it?
The kid has to go.
They're
not gonna give him up
without a good fight.
Tollerman
won't allow it.
So if he
won't come to us,
then we'll have
to go and take him.
Yeah, okay.
Or I could
just come to you.
You must be insane, boy.
Maybe.
Could be hereditary.
Tell me something, kid.
Did the Synod
send you up here?
What the heck is a Synod?
You really don't
know shit, do you?
I know about Lucinda.
I know you
took her by force.
You watch
your mouth, boy.
Before you
all try to kill me,
I'm just here to tell you
something, Connor.
Lucinda Wills
was my mother.
That's not possible.
Lucinda died
before she gave birth.
That's what
Tollerman told you.
The truth is
she committed suicide
a few days
after I was born.
Is that right?
I'm gonna give you
the same chance
I give everyone.
Run.
No.
You can either
leave this town alone
and let Angelina go...
Or?
You'll force me
to stop you.
Okay, then.
Kill him.
Come on, then!
Check that way.
Okay then. Who's next?
I'm pretty sure
it's you, kid.
Oh, God.
They're killing him!
No. Angel!
Angel!
You can't help him!
Boy.
Animal!
Cayden.
It was Cayden.
Wolves,
just like you.
Lucinda got pregnant.
She let you go.
Lucinda died
before she gave birth.
She killed herself
that September.
He's a monster.
At least Angel survives.
Don't you get that?
They're your own
flesh and blood.
I'll give you
the same chance
I give everyone.
How do you think
I got so pretty?
Run.
Oh, yeah.
This doesn't look good.
Losing your life force,
you can't even
hold your true form.
Wild Joe?
Get up,
you little sucker.
Get up.
It's over.
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up.
Oh, my God.
John!
John!
I was trying
not to kill them.
That was a mistake.
It's life or death
out here.
I... I need a hospital
or a vet or something.
You don't need
a hospital.
You need to change.
You have to get out
and run.
I can't.
It's too painful.
Trust us.
You have to change.
If you don't, son,
you ain't gonna make it.
Just try.
Jesus!
I can't.
I can't.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay, you need to run.
Oh, my God.
Angel, that's not
gonna happen right now.
You have to, okay?
It's the only way.
Trust me.
Go.
Oh, God.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
Jesus.
Aah!
What's the word, Kino?
All the guys
are pretty messed up,
slashes, broken bones.
Get them up and running.
They'll feel better.
Well, the rest of us
don't heal like you do,
like he does.
That's if
he survived the fall.
So, you think it's true?
You think the kid
is your son?
I can't beat them.
There's way too many.
If I go back up there,
they'll kill me.
You should go,
save yourself.
You think I could do that?
No.
I have to beat them,
all of them.
Otherwise,
John, Clara, you,
the whole town
will never be safe.
I know there's
got to be a way.
I just can't think of it.
I'm sorry I got you
into all this shit.
What? Don't be.
It's not your fault.
I got myself
into all this shit.
Come on.
Whoa!
What is
that horrible stench?
Oh, excuse me, my dear.
That is my personal
collection of genuine,
A1, organic,
fully recycled
ovine detritus,
and it is extremely good
for the soil.
And extremely
explosive, right?

Okay, hand me
the next one.
Yeah.
What are
the shotgun shells for?
Trigger.
Take a keen eye,
though.
Oh, keenest eye
in the northeast, son.
You know,
it's gonna wreak havoc
on your land, John.
Well, better my land
than your lives.
I'm gonna set up inside.
I'm going up there
with you.
No.
If anything happens to you,
all of this was
for nothing.
Run home. Pack your bags.
When all this is over,
meet me at the motel
at the bottom of the hill.
Then we'll leave.
We'll be free.
Clara!
Angel!
Maybe someone noticed
something back in town.
Maybe they'll send
somebody for help.
When they grabbed me,
I didn't see
a single person left.
It's like
all the normal ones
left town,
like they knew.
She's right.
They knew.
John Tollerman. Ladies.
Can't thank you enough
for coming to my big night.
Well, it seems
like we couldn't
stay away.
Yeah.
Tell me something,
John.
Where's the kid?
The kid's dead.
We buried him
where he fell.
I guess lies come easy
after 20 years of 'em, right?
It's no lie.
He was your son,
and you killed him.
Bullshit, John.
If he were my son,
that would mean you'd
hidden Lucinda away from me,
hey, lied to me
for more than 20 years,
and you'd have to know
how you'd suffer for that.
You think
I'm afraid of dying?
It's not the dying, John.
It's what comes first.
Oh, yeah!
Uh-oh.
Oh, shit.
It's the big moment.
Can you believe I'm
a little bit nervous?
You ought to be.
Okay, John.
Oh, my God.
What have they done
to her, John?
She's been drugged.
Don't worry, Angel.
This'll all be over
by midnight,
assuming you
whelp me a boy.
Hey, I'm doing this
for you, Angel.
I'm doing this
for all of us.
This sucks.
We're missing
the whole party.
Hey, if Connor
says he'll show,
he'll show,
and then we kill him.
And then we'll party.
Huh? Did you hear that?
Connor...
Friends, been
a long time coming,
this night,
and what a thing,
having my badass pack
here to see it.
Connor!
And I want
to thank Angel here
for just making me
the happiest wolf
in the woods.
Oh, shit.
It's like we're
mated already.
Well, best get on with it, eh?
Connory Slaughter...
Yes!
Alpha dog...
leader of the pack,
do you take
this bitch for...
well, tonight,
basically?
I do.
Angelina Timmins,
owner of the only bar
in town...
do you take...
Uh, Deke...
she does.
All right. Well, uh,
it's the big moment,
so if you'll excuse us,
you guys enjoy yourselves,
and we'll be back
in, let's say,
20 minutes.
Oh, hell, make it 40.
Unless, of course,
anyone's got any objections.
Doesn't count, Gail.
All right, then.
Let's do it.
I have
an objection!
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I warn you to leave
these people alone?
Well, they're
my pack, boy.
They do
what I tell 'em.
This isn't a pack.
Wolves don't terrorize towns
or kidnap innocents
or brutalize women.
You're barely wolves at all!
Okay, then, boys,
let's show him
what we really are!
Hey!
You traitorous bitch!
Go, John! Save him!
Okay, here we go.
Listen to me,
all of you!
Turn back, and survive!
Stay...
and I'll kill you all.
Bring him to me now.
What in the hell?
Find him, Kino!
Bring me his head!
We gotta be smart
about this!
We got...
You can't hide
from me, boy.
Go, John, now!
Ah, my poor barn.
Holy shit.
This is my town,
you little bastard!
You did this to me!
You made me
the monster I am!
Not monster enough,
apparently.
I guess you really
did have some fight
in you, kid.
Come on.
Goodbye,
Connory Slaughter.
No!
You've done
hideous things
in your life,
and you
deserve to die.
You're right.
But you should know...
I never took
Lucinda by force.
I loved her,
and she loved me.
When her father
found out she was pregnant,
he threatened
to kill her,
so I took
the fall for it.
They took the woman
that I loved away from me...
and I just...
became the monster
they said I always was.
Well, I tell you, boys,
being here to witness
this happy homecoming
warms the cockles
of my heart,
makes all my trouble
worthwhile.
Wahoo!
I knew it.
Joe Wills.
All these years later,
hey,
it's Connory Slaughter
beaten, on his knees.
See that eye of yours
never healed, did it?
Nope.
Just a one-eyed Jack
with the gimpy limp
so I'd never forget
what you did to me.
You know what
your old man told me
when he exiled me
from this town?
He said that I was
too wild, too brutal.
Swore I'd come back
and kill you.
He just laughed at me.
But the kid was the key.
You never knew he existed.
You never heard
the stories.
But my little brother
Carter,
he told me,
he told me all about it.
Why don't you just
turn around and crawl
right out of town?
You think I went
to all this trouble
tracking
your offspring down,
bringing him here,
killing his parents
just to walk away,
just to let you live?
You did what?
What?
Oh, yeah,
I killed your folks,
and I kind of made
the cops think it was you.
Why?!
Why?
To get you to grow up,
to bring you here,
to put him
in this exact situation!
You son of a bitch!
Ah, forget it.
You're too beat up
to fight me now,
I mean,
the both of youse.
I'd beat you
with one hand tied
behind my back.
This is my day!
Oh, baby, I've earned it.
Hey, Joe...
Yeah.
You know
your brother Carter?
He's my favorite.
I had him for dinner
two days ago.
Ah, sweet dreams, Connor.
I'll kill you, Joe!
Kill me?
You're my trained dog, boy.
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.
You were never too wild
for this town, Joe.
Just too crazy.
Ah, damn.
Ah...
help me, kid.
Huh?
No?
Ever been shot
in the shoulder?
It's like getting
kicked in the Jimmy,
but it's
the shoulder.
So, are you gonna
kill me now, too, huh?
Before you do,
give you
an interesting
little tidbit.
Wolves, real wolves,
they only kill
for food or defense.
Well, I'm not a wolf, Joe.
I'm a human being.
That's my point, son.
They're all
calling you a murderer,
a cold-blooded killer.
It's not true.
It's not what you are.
I've killed tonight,
because of you.
No, kid.
Because you had to.
It was Connor.
It's always
been Connor.
He made us this way.
He did it
to all of us.
Well,
Connor's dead now, Joe.
That's right.
I killed the monster
that made you, boy...
so we're all paid up.
We're even.
Even?
Yeah.
Is that what we are?
You know...
I guess it's true.
I never have killed
anyone in cold blood.
But life is...
complicated.
And you ate
my fucking parents.
All right, boy!
Come on!
Show me what you got!
What I've got, Joe?
Yeah.
Fu...
Hey.
Hey.
There.
That should fertilize
the soybeans.
And no one
need ever know.
So who's up
for some breakfast?
John, I gotta go.
So soon?
Well, you, uh...
you got a home here
now, you know.
Nah, I... I know,
and we'll be back.
It's just that...
It's... It's me, John.
I need to get away
from here,
for a while, anyway.
Well...
you got something
you'd better take
with you, then.
Now, uh, this,
this is
a very rare piece.
It... It traces
all the old lines
all the way back,
so you keep it safe.
So many.
Yeah.
Yeah.
John, I... I can't
take this from you.
This is...
Oh, you keep that
with you.
That'll come in handy.
Wherever you go,
you look
for those names.
It'll give you
a heads-up.
Well, thank you, Clara.
You take care.
Yeah.
Thanks for everything...
Yeah.
Uncle John.
Yeah.
