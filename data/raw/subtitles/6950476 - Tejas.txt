Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Port Blair. This is 217.
Engine failure confirmed.
Copy.
Port Blair. 217.
Can anybody copy me?
I've lost control of the aircraft.
Port Blair. 217. Engine failure.
I'm going down.
Aafia, let's go.
Tejas; Radar.
Any visual contact?
Negative, sir.
Vivek's radio isn't responding.
Radar; Tejas.
Aircraft debris located in water.
But no sign of the pilot.
Base station; Tejas.
Parachute located.
I can see Vivek's parachute
on an island.
Copied. Coordinates?
11;55'04"North.
89;35'23"East.
Tejas, abort.
Abort mission now.
Sir?
Vivek is stranded
on North Sentinel Island
which is a prohibited area.
For 50,000 years
this island has been home
to the Sentinelese tribe.
They have no connection
with the outside world.
Setting foot on this island
is illegal and punishable.
And dangerous too.
They have killed visitors in the past.
Sir, Vivek's in front of my eyes.
I can see him, sir.
It will only take a couple
of minutes, sir.
Rules are rules, Tejas.
We'll need the government's permission
for this rescue mission.
We are running out of time, sir.
Vivek's right in front of me.
His life is in danger.
Give me 10 minutes.
I will save him.
Tejas; Base Commander.
Abort now and return to base.
This is an order.
Tejas, do you copy.
Tejas, abort mission now.
Tejas, do you copy?
Abort mission now, Tejas!
Tejas, do you copy?
Tejas, abort mission now.
Tejas, do you copy?
Abort mission now, Tejas!
Tejas, do you copy?
Tejas...
It's a prohibited area, Tejas.
So don't land the helicopter.
Hover steady.
And take me closer to Vivek.
The wind speed is too strong, Tejas.
Lower the rescue cable.
Tejas!
So at 4G and 200 knots
your stall speed will be 400 knots.
If you don't follow anti-G measures
at high altitudes,
you can blackout,
because of the G force.
Any questions?
- Sir.
- Yes?
- Sir, I've two questions.
- Yes.
When can I fly my first aircraft?
I know the cost structure.
If I learn faster,
can I do it earlier?
Like, in this semester itself?
Tejas, slow down.
In the next term,
first the simulator.
Then dual-check.
And then comes your first solo sortie.
No trainee has ever finished
this before the allotted time.
In fact,
every year almost a dozen cadets
fail to complete this course.
Maybe I can be the first.
Can I please try?
Okay.
Let's test you.
Isn't your name Tejas?
Yes, sir.
So tell me,
what do you know about
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's
Tejas aircraft?
What is unique about it?
Anybody?
If you answer,
I'll gift you your first aircraft.
Tejas aircraft is unique
for its aerodynamically unstable
tailless compound
delta wing configuration.
Optimised primarily
for manoeuvrability and agility
which means it can be manoeuvred
in any direction,
regardless of pure
aerodynamic principles.
Sir, it has the flyby wire system,
in which the manual flight control
is replaced by an electronic interface,
which automatically manoeuvres
the flight,
and stabilises it when needed.
- Sir, it's engine--
- Stop.
Tejas, your first aircraft will soon
be delivered to your room.
Academy 101; Startup.
101, clear to startup.
Runway 09, left. QNH 1013.
Academy 101; Taxi.
101, taxi for runway 09, left.
QNH, 1013.
Academy 101; line up.
101, clear line up.
Winds...090 10 knots.
Academy 101, take off.
101, clear for takeoff.
Full throttle.
Temperature... oil pressure normal.
Release brakes.
Tejas, eject.
Tejas, eject now.
It was an engine failure, Tejas.
You should have ejected.
Greetings.
Aafia Ali from Fatehpur.
What are the orders for me?
Guessing you quarrelled too much.
Missing home?
What happened?
Breakup.
Ohh...
Why?
Two-timing.
He was two-timing you,
and you are crying for him?
You only broke up with him,
I would have broken
his nose.
I was two-timing him and got caught.
What are you crying for?
The breakup?
Or that you were caught?
Both.
I always thought I was clever.
But I got caught.
Do you know how tough it is,
to date two boyfriends
at the same time?
Don't laugh.
He was a great guy.
Why are you laughing?
"My heart's crazy,
stubborn and bold,"
My heart's crazy,
ready to defy fate I'm told,
My heart's crazy,
stubborn and bold,
My heart's crazy,
ready to defy fate I'm told,
Tejas Gill.
I know you can't win.
I know.
But I know I won't lose either.
It's a love warrior,
brave and high,
Its courage is soaring up in the sky.
My heart's crazy...
If there's passion in the blood,
it'll race ahead,
Leaving all seas behind
without any regret,
My heart's crazy...
If there's passion in the blood,
it'll race ahead,
Leaving all seas behind
without any regret,
My heart's crazy...
My heart's crazy
with an emperor's attitude and flair,
It'll conquer the sun
and rule the airs.
My heart's crazy,
stubborn and bold,
My heart's crazy,
ready to defy fate I'm told,
My heart's crazy...
My heart's crazy...
My heart's crazy...
Prashant.
What are you blabbering?
Couple of lines I wrote
to motivate myself.
What did you write?
We'll soar in the skies.
Serve this country with pride.
- What?
- We'll soar in the skies!
Serve this country with pride!
- Prashant.
- Yes, sir.
Good night, Tejas.
Every star
in the sky salute with pride,
As we soar together,
side by side.
Oh, God,
colour me in your divine hue,
When are you guys visiting me next?
I am missing everyone.
Everyone?
Or just your father?
You, father,
and that idiot, in that order.
Where is he?
His exam results just came in.
He's brooding.
Every stars
in the sky salute with pride,
As we soar together,
side by side.
Oh, God,
colour me in your divine hue,
Oh, God, grant my prayers
and make my yearning few.
My heart's crazy,
stubborn and bold,
My heart's crazy,
ready to defy fate I'm told,
It's a love warrior,
brave and high,
Its courage is soaring up
in the sky.
My heart's crazy...
You are its true love,
the one it adores,
You are the thread
that helps it soar,
My love, my fate,
you are its pride for sure,
You are its true love,
the one it adores,
My heart's crazy...
This is your first solo flight.
Just take a deep breath.
Enjoy this moment.
Less than 0.2 percent of people
in the world,
can feel this unique experience,
which you are going
to experience today.
Tejas.
Taxi the aircraft towards the runway.
Yes, sir.
Tejas, what do you see?
Runway, sir.
Look again.
Think and then tell me.
What do you see?
Sir, I see the path to serve
my country, my nation.
Then what are you waiting for, Tejas.
Go ahead.
Nobody can stop you
from serving your nation.
Tejas; Tower.
Return to base.
Sir, five minutes more.
Please, sir.
Khatooni has claimed responsibility
for the blasts last week
in Anant Nag's army school.
In the video, he threatened India
to carry out more attacks.
India has demanded Pakistan hand
over Khatooni as soon as possible.
Khatooni is the chief of Lashkar-e-Pak,
and he's been involved
in terrorist activities
in India for 15 years.
He played a role
in the 26/11 attacks.
Tejas. Careful.
Listen. Relax.
Lie down.
Relax.
Look to your right.
Yeah.
Left.
Very good.
Officer.
You've been unconscious
for three days.
Your body has grown weak.
Please--
How is wing-commander Vivek?
He is fine.
And has returned to his unit.
See those flowers.
He sends them every day
from Delhi for you.
When can I return to my unit?
Tejas, we must fly to Delhi
after you are discharged
from the hospital.
Disobedience, section 41.
Insubordination, section 42.
Entering a prohibited area
under Aboriginal tribe's regulations,
section 07.
Offences related to flying,
section 62.
And 10 other breaches.
Do you two have anything to say?
Sorry, sir.
You will be questioned
by a court of inquiry.
Won't be a complicated decision.
For this flying indiscipline,
you can be relieved
from the Air Force.
Sir, we saved an IAF officer's life.
Yes. By not following orders.
You didn't even wait
for the medical team.
We didn't have time
to wait for the medical team.
And what's more important?
Someone's life or orders?
- And the tribals?
- This was a rescue mission.
I had a pistol which I didn't use it.
Not a single tribal was harmed.
And what if you had?
The Indian government protects
this tribe.
Any outside interaction
can wipe out their entire population.
One sneeze.
Any inch of any foreign particle.
Sir, I leave the decision to you.
But I want to ask,
what would you have done
in the same situation?
Sir, I've something else to tell you.
But in private.
Sir, Aafia didn't want to proceed.
I forced her.
As a matter of fact,
she was only following my orders.
You can punish me, not her.
Aafia knew
you would say something like that.
She confessed her role already.
Jai Hind, sir.
Tejas.
You Shouldn't be so emotional, Aafia.
You are saying this?
Yes, I am.
Do you know what it means to be
discharged from the Indian Air Force?
This uniform is our identity.
Our soul.
Can you manage without it?
Can you?
Wing Commander Tejas.
Who is behind me?
Wing Commander Vivek,
whose life we saved
and can be thrown
out of the Air Force.
And also crying.
Jai Hind, sir.
This is for you.
I heard you are in Delhi
so I came by.
To thank you personally.
Thank you for saving my life.
My pleasure.
You too, Aafia.
It's okay, sir.
Well...
thank you.
Tejas, can I take you out for lunch?
Aafia, you too can join
if you are free.
Fortunately for you, sir,
I am not free.
So, Tejas.
Lunch?
Please.
Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer!
Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer!
Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer!
Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer!
Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer! Ekveer!
Watch...
he'll look up in style and say...
So I wrote this song
for my future girlfriend.
"I hope she's in the crowd."
I hope she's in the crowd.
"My love."
"My love."
"My heart always knew it was you."
"Let my eyes cross with yours."
"Your face is worth dying for."
"Let my eyes cross with yours."
"Your face is worth dying for."
"I feel...
like it's heavenly love."
"Knew..."
"My heart always knew it was you."
"Always knew..."
"Knew..."
"My heart always knew it was you."
"Always knew..."
"Everyone believes it,
except for you?
"My heart's always known you."
"My love."
"My love."
"My heart always knew it was you."
"My love."
"My love."
"My heart always knew it was you."
"My love."
"My love."
"My heart always knew it was you."
"It's a blessing of God, my love."
"This has happened before, my love."
"Even the stars say so, my love."
"My love."
"It's a blessing of God, my love."
"This has happened before, my love."
"Even the stars say so, my love."
"My love."
"My love."
"My love."
"My heart always knew it was you."
"My love."
"My love."
"My heart always knew it was you."
I remember I was in third year
of college when my friend insisted
on coming here
and I still don't regret it at all.
I still like him. He sings so well.
He sang so well even today.
I was in 3rd year of college...
Hey, did you just...
My friend told me about him.
I just don't regret it,
I am so thankful...
Tejas. What's wrong?
- Excuse me, this is the men's room.
- Sorry, sorry.
A guy in red jacket came
in here after manhandling a girl.
I want to talk to him.
Everyone else go out.
Come on.
Everyone out.
What's wrong?
What is all the commotion about?
Even you look pretty amazing.
I can manhandle you too.
What did you say?
Sorry. Sorry.
I said sorry, ma'am.
- Say that again.
- Sorry. Sorry.
Ma'am, huh?
Excuse me. Ma'am.
You were so good in there.
You even had me scared for a minute.
I was wearing a red jacket.
I am Ekveer.
I know.
Tejas.
- Tejas.
- Tejas Gill.
It's nice to meet you, Tejas.
Are you a judo or karate instructor?
No...
We're a big fan of yours.
- Seriously.
- Hi.
Can you please take a picture of us?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh my, God.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.
Tejas.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
No.
No?
I am just saying that
girls are crazy about me.
And I am asking you out to dinner,
and you are turning me down.
So?
Goodnight.
What was he saying?
Come on, let's go.
Goodnight.
Tejas.
Fighter pilot.
Photo, please.
Can you just take a picture of us?
Yes, sure.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
One picture with me too, please.
May I?
Thank you.
Well, if not lunch,
let's have dinner together.
Why?
Girls are crazy after you.
Yeah, that's true but...
not a single one in uniform.
You have nothing to worry about.
I am a really nice guy, so...
Occasionally funny also.
So...
dinner?
Yes.
Let me think.
Let you think.
Okay.
Ekveer.
Yes, sir.
Come.
Thank you.
So, this is one of my
favourite restaurants.
And I think you're going to love it.
Wine?
Okay, fine.
This is not my favourite restaurant.
I've never bloody been here.
"Let your eyes sink in mine."
"I can give a lifetime for this face."
"Let your eyes sink in mine."
"I can give a lifetime for this face."
"Seems like..."
"Love of the skies..."
So, I wrote this song
for my future girlfriend.
And she is in the crowd.
"It knows you..."
"My hearts knows it's you."
"Only you."
"My beloved"
"My beloved"
"My beloved"
What do you want?
Like...I mean as a soldier.
As in?
As in?
As a singer,
I want to encourage folk music.
Give it more exposure.
Similarly...as a soldier,
what do you want?
As a soldier, what do I want?
Leave it.
It's a long list.
It'll come straight from my heart,
and you will get bored.
Sound more of a lecture.
No, I want to know.
Please.
I wasn't expecting you to do that,
but thank you.
You know, I love momos,
and this is my favourite place.
I used to come here with my dad.
'Pakistani terrorists
are visible in the video'.
'Alerting us they nabbed
this Indian-origin
engineer from the Pashtun area'.
No demands have been made yet.
This video was uploaded
30 mins ago on YouTube.
We don't have much information yet,
but Pakistani terrorists can be seen
in the video.
Telling us they nabbed
this Indian-origin engineer
from the Pashtun area.
Another video
where this Indian is being tortured.
"Tell us."
Can't see it.
Which engineer is he?
He is an Indian spy.
How do you know?
Hasn't said anything even
after being tortured.
Who else would he be?
Dismissed.
Your court of enquiry
has been shifted to next week.
Sir.
Something serious is afoot.
Doesn't the engineer seem familiar?
In the new video,
the terrorists have demanded
Kashmir's independence.
Otherwise, they will kill Shikhar Puri.
In a press conference,
the Defence Minister stated
that the Indian government
will not negotiate with terrorists.
Shikhar Puri is an engineer.
He was travelling from Kabul
to Pakistan regarding highway contracts.
"Tell us."
Tell us.
Tell us.
Tell us.
Tell us.
What did you say?
What did I say?
The engineer seemed familiar.
Yeah, so.
It's Prashant.
Who?
We'll soar in the skies.
Serve the country with pride.
Yeah, that's Prashant Chaudhary.
He quit the academy midway.
What did he say before he left?
"I am leaving.
I've found the purpose of my life."
Zoom in.
See how he's blinking his eyes.
What is he doing?
He's trying to communicate something.
What?
Morse code.
How many times did he blink first?
Three fast blinks at first.
Then?
Three slow blinks.
Again, three fast blinks.
Same as letter one.
Second video.
Blink, then pause.
Again blink.
Then, the video moves away
from his face.
Check the third video.
There must be something on it.
Okay.
Jai Hind, sir.
Wing Commander Tejas.
She was with Prashant
in the academy.
Yes, Tejas. Tell me.
Sir, Prashant is trying
to communicate through Morse code,
through blinking his eyes.
What?
The first video, SOS.
In the second video,
the camera is moved from his face, but...
He mentions a name in the third video.
Mir Ali.
Sir, who is Mir Ali?
Mir Ali is no one.
Mir Ali is the name of a village,
in North Waziristan.
It's a Pakistani tribal area.
The epicentre of terror.
And Prashant's location.
Prashant wants us to rescue him
from Mir Ali.
Prashant is our best agent, sir.
He doesn't care about his life.
He isn't asking you to rescue him.
He has some sort of information
which he wants to pass on to us.
And without a doubt,
it is something big.
Any intelligence breakthrough?
Someone might know?
Sir, Prashant does?
In the second video,
he was telling us
the location of the attack,
when the camera was moved.
Sir, let's rescue Prashant
and ask him.
She is right.
Our only option is an air operation.
Land and sea are out.
I'll get clearance from the PMO.
You guys prepare for the mission.
We are running short on time.
Thank you, Tejas.
You may leave.
Sir.
I want to be part of this mission.
Tejas. I know about your past.
This is not your personal battle.
- Sir--
- Dismissed.
Tejas.
Tejas.
Here you go.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
I was a low-ranking engineer at DRDO.
I've seen the Tejas aircraft
being built from scratch.
Get modified.
In 2001, when Vajpayee sir christened
the aircraft built by us 'Tejas',
she was the happiest.
The same day,
she came to me and said,
"Papa, I want to be a fighter pilot."
And look at her.
She flies the Tejas now.
And that's her first day in the academy.
These are pictures from her academy.
That's her graduation picture.
Whenever I see her in uniform,
I feel proud.
And emotional.
He's always in tears.
He also sings a song.
What...
Uncle...Tejas told me everything...
No, son.
...that you write
and sing really well.
Sing, please.
Don't look at me.
I love your song.
- Really?
- Yes.
I've no choice but to sing now.
"Be seated beside me,"
"I've much to say."
"It's been a while,"
"I've been saving this smile."
"Stay a little longer."
"Stay a little longer, will you."
"Stay a little longer."
"We haven't counted the stars yet,"
"dreams still unfulfilled."
"I've just become a cloud,"
"waiting to rain on you."
"The conversation left incomplete,"
"come and complete it."
"The twists are yet to come
in the story,"
"Several friendships yet to forge."
"I've waiting to do mischief again."
"The conversation left incomplete,"
"come and complete it."
"Be seated beside me,"
"I've so much to say."
"It's been a while,"
"I've been saving this smile for you."
"Stay a little longer."
"Stay a little longer, will you."
No!
And they tell me
it's not a personal battle.
My parents, Ekveer
and Rohan were all having dinner.
They all looked
so happy before they were shot.
And they tell me
it's not a personal battle.
Then why didn't you give a reply?
You should have.
Entire country is on high alert.
We've to get the answer
before we meet the PMO.
Jai Hind, sir.
Sir.
Sir, I want to be a part of this mission.
Tejas.
This is not personal.
It is personal for me, sir.
Terrorism should be personal
for everyone in this world.
It's the only way
to totally annihilate it.
It is personal for me.
Wing Commander Tejas,
we treat our women as our pride.
Out on the battlefield,
what's more dangerous
than losing your life
is losing your honour--
Sir, my honour lies in my heart,
not my body.
And no one can take it.
Yes, Tejas is one of my students.
After losing everything
in the 26/11 attacks,
she joined back and excelled
in her fighter training.
And surprised all of us.
Why do you ask, Singh?
I am considering her for a mission.
I see.
Is the mission easy or dangerous?
Meaning?
If the mission is easy,
then don't send her.
But if it's risky and dangerous,
you're confused about
"who can get the job done"?
Then definitely send her.
She will get the job done.
She is different. An oddball.
Don't expect her
to follow all the orders.
But the orders she won't follow
will make your mission better.
26/11 took everything from her.
Except for one.
Her country.
Thank you.
Jai Hind, sir.
Jai Hind.
Tejas, you won't be facing
any inquiries now.
You will soon be briefed
on the mission details.
You will lead the mission.
Yes sir.
Don't you want to know
what the mission is called?
Tejas.
Mission Tejas.
The Tejas aircraft, built by us,
will be used in this mission
for the first time.
So...Mission Tejas.
Jai Hind.
Tejas!
We have an uphill task ahead.
Let's go.
'Couple of lines I wrote
to motivate myself.'
'What did you write?'
'We'll soar in the skies.'
'Serve this country with pride.'
'We'll soar in the skies.'
'Serve this country with pride.'
Water?
Thank you.
I couldn't see the entire video.
No mother would wish
to see her son like that.
Take a seat.
These are old pictures of him.
He hasn't come home for 10 years.
He would call occasionally.
Do you have a favourite superhero?
I do.
Batman.
Prashant used to say...
"Every mother is a superhero."
When it was time to choose between
his mother and his country.
He chose his country.
Said, "You're a superhero, mom".
"You can handle yourself."
"My country needs me."
I haven't seen him in 10 years.
Please bring him back.
Tell him...
to come see me once
before I lose my superpowers.
Bring him back.
Bring him back.
Kill him.

He beheads people...
hence he got the nickname
'Sarqalam'.
15 beheadings in the past year...
Single-handedly.
Sir, who was he?
Edwin Dale.
Journalist from Norway.
He was covering a story
on Pakistani tribals.
A month ago, they picked him up.
The demand was for Norway
to withdraw their forces from Syria.
She is here.
So, ma'am,
this is a very-very challenging mission.
Because there is a possibility
of an enemy counter-attack.
Half a dozen of our aircrafts
can cross the border
and make it to Mir Ali.
But the flight time will be 45 minutes.
And the problem is, ma'am,
at the beginning of the mission,
if Pakistan intercepts
our aircrafts,
then the mission will fail.
And that is not an option,
you know that.
Then what are you suggesting?
Tejas.
Small team.
Two aircrafts, two pilots.
One combat aircraft,
and another two-seater for Prashant.
Whether you have two aircrafts
or two dozen,
they can be detected and intercepted
at the beginning of the mission.
The mission can still fail.
How does this solve our problem?
Ma'am, the plan is not
to take off from India.
Then where will the aircrafts
take off from?
Pakistan.
If we take off from their base
we can take them by surprise.
We can avoid the possibility of--
Will we use Pakistani aircrafts?
Ma'am, not possible.
For that, we'll need a lot of time.
And time is what we don't have.
Our own aircrafts
will take off from Pakistan.
Forget take off,
how will our aircrafts land
in Pakistan in the first place?
We are still trying to work that out.
The Prime Minister has to be briefed
about the entire mission tomorrow.
Please figure it out fast.
What happened?
Why are you repeatedly calling me?
Found a way to land the aircrafts.
No, we haven't.
- I found one.
- Let me tell you...
After the murder of Edwin Dale,
Norway has cut all ties with Pakistan.
This huge 'Globetrotter'
airplane you see behind me...
There is a reason we're showing you.
This airplane filled with fertilisers,
might not travel to Islamabad.
The president of Norway
will finally decide tomorrow
whether they will continue
their affiliation with Pakistan or not.
This doesn't play
in Pakistan's favour.
Because Pakistan imports 30%
of its fertilisers from Norway.
I am sorry.
Can you explain it to me again?
It's 5 am,
and my mind is still a little sleepy.
Sir, we fly out from Norway
on Sunday,
in one of your
Globetrotter cargo planes,
filled with supplies,
fertilisers, iron sheets,
hiding two of our Tejas aircrafts
to Islamabad.
At Kannu airport,
which is half an hour from Mir Ali.
Your Globetrotter will land
because of a technical glitch.
We alight with our aircraft,
and your Globetrotter flies
to Islamabad.
And...what will you do
once you guys get dropped?
Look, guys, if you want our help,
you'll have to be less secretive.
We go and get our man Shikhar Puri,
who is captured in Mir Ali.
And fly back to India
in our aircrafts.
And the Pakistani Air Force?
They are just going to sit
and watch this show.
We are taking off from their land.
By the time they figure
it's an Indian aircraft,
or not one of theirs or the US,
we will cross the borders.
And how do you intend
to get your Indian aircrafts
into Norway so soon?
They are already there, sir.
The air show in Oslo 10 days ago.
displayed two Tejas fighter aircrafts.
They are still there.
We just have to get two of
our pilots to Norway.
And who are these brave pilots,
willing to go on such
a suicide mission?
The one leading the mission
is standing in front of you.
This is risky,
and its failure can bring
international shame.
What shall I tell my Prime Minister?
Tell him we'll do the same
to Sarqalam,
what he did
to your journalist Edwin Dale.
Should have asked
before suggesting my name.
It's not too late.
You're giving me attitude instead
of thanking me.
Thank you.
But I am so nervous.
How am I going to convince
my seniors inside?
Aafia.
Convince yourself first.
Everyone else will be convinced
automatically.
Speak straight from the heart.
Just be confident, okay.
Confident.
Confident.
Aafia, Tejas has said
good things about you.
You even flew the Tejas aircraft.
That's a plus.
True, sir.
Whatever Tejas said about me,
is correct and the truth.
That's humble.
Sir, this mission is special for us.
What we are doing is the right thing.
- This proves--
- What does this prove?
That...
This is new India.
We'll charge right in, and kill.
And in this case,
also save our soldiers.
Sir.
Are we making a sequel to some film?
Are you sure about her?
Sir, Aafia is a bit dramatic.
But sir, she is qualified
in low-level flying.
She was with me in weapons
and explosives training.
In fact, I could have never saved
Wing Commander Vivek alone,
if it wasn't for Aafia.
The Globetrotter was her idea, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Not a word in front
of the Prime Minister.
Sir.
Why are we waiting till Saturday?
Why can't we do it early?
Mir Ali is a large area.
We are not exactly sure at
which location Prashant is being held.
But we have a rough idea
of where they can kill him on Sunday.
Because the past two beheadings
were done in that area.
Where?
Sir. There is only one desert area
in Mir Ali.
Musaki.
So...we have to be at that location
on Sunday before 5 pm.
We cannot go sooner
because of aircrafts, etcetera.
How far is it from the landing site?
Twenty kilometres in a straight line.
But they can't use the road.
They will have to rough it out.
What if the aircrafts are detected
on their way back?
Sir, we are trained
to tackle every situation.
Trust us.
We'll kill it.
I know.
Let's do this.
"Lord, bless me with strength so
I never deviate from doing a good deed."
"May I never be afraid while
facing the enemy in battle,"
"and determine my victory."
"Lord, bless me with strength,"
"so I never deviate
from doing a good deed."
"May I never be afraid while
facing the enemy in battle,"
"and determine my victory."
Help!
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind, sir.
Jai Hind.
Always remember,
when in doubt,
think about the nation.
Pretty daring mission, I must say.
Beautiful, isn't she?
But how will you hide your
aircrafts in Kannu airport.
Speaking of them, where are they?
Right there.
Where?
There.
The Power of illusion.
We will soon be entering
Pakistani airspace.
What happened?
It's nothing.
I've never seen you so nervous before.
What happened?
If we fail, people will say,
"Should have sent the boys".
That they have been saying
for thousands of years.
But things change.
The day will come
when boys will fail
and everyone will say,
"Should have sent the girls."
We have a problem.
Take controls.
We cannot land at Kannu airport.
- Why?
- Islamabad ATC said we can't.
Kannu airstrip was bombed,
in a drone attack this morning.
Now what?
We can land in Bohat.
Isn't a part of that airport used
for military operations?
Mir Ali is 30 minutes from there.
Should we abort the mission?
No. Let's land at Bohat.
Yes, there is some technical problem.
Clear to land on runway 20.
Landing on runway 20. Confirmed.
Land on 30.
But they said 20.
Make some technical excuse
and land on Runway 30.
It's at a distance from the ATC.
We'll have less eyeballs on us.
Come on.
C-17 Globetrotter 3,
clear to land on runway 20.
Confirmed.
C-17 Globetrotter 3,
land on runway...
Why is C-17 heading for runway 30?
Oh, God. They are here.
Calm down.
We can do it.
Good afternoon.
You were told to land on runway 20.
Sorry. I heard 30.
What's the problem?
Some wire burnt,
I think in the circuit breaker panel.
Do you mind
if my engineer takes a look?
Sure.
Open it.
We need to check the cargo as well.
But it's only carrying fertilisers.
You are not allowed to check it.
We have the necessary papers
from the Pakistan government.
In Pakistan,
the army decides everything.
Not the government.
It's good.
We should check the cockpit once.
Who is in there?
It's jammed.
There is no one inside.
Break it down.
What are you doing?
It's empty, sir.
I told you, there is no one inside.
Did you check the entire plane?
Yes, sir.
Did you check behind these?
Check it.
Everything is alright.
You are good to take off.
We should check
the main frame board once.
I don't want to crash-land
in Islamabad.
Climb up.
- This is the main frame?
- Yes.
I think this one...
Are you okay?
Yeah, I am fine.
That shock was shocking.
I told you not to touch the wires.
All good here.
Take off in five minutes.
Out of here.
Guys, it's me.
- How much time do we have?
- Twenty minutes.
Let's go.
Tejas. What's the status?
Sir, aircrafts are out.
Aafia is taking pictures.
Hurry.
Prashant doesn't have too long.
This is a tiring job.
And Wasim sir
is breathing down my neck.
What is going on here?
Why haven't you given
them take-off permission yet?
Sir, we gave them permission
15 minutes ago.
How much?
Sixty per cent.
Oh, God. He's coming back.
He's coming back.
What is taking so long?
We're going to be all dead.
Come on.
Faster.
Oh, God. He's here.
We've to leave now.
Calm down.
They have to be told everything twice.
Why aren't you moving?
Do you want to die here?
What are you staring at, you idiot?
Just get out of here.
If you stay here another minute,
you will never leave Pakistan again.
Out.
Power of illusion.
And he's calling us fools.
The Indian government has confirmed,
they will not entertain
any of the terrorist's demands.
Many countries like America and China...
Bring that rascal.
Let's go.
Let's go.
For the terrorists...
Move fast, girls.
Prashant has only 30 minutes.
Come on.
I think this is the location.
Reached the location, sir.
Are you sure this is the place?
Same place as last time?
Tejas.
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!

Let's finish these rascals, Tejas.
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Wait.
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!

Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Sarqalam! Sarqalam! Sarqalam!
Okay.
Let's get them.
Allahu Akbar.
American drone!
American drone!
American drone!
Come back you idiots.
It's not an American drone.
Come back you idiots.
It's not an American drone.
It's not an American drone.
Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar
Don't think of Allah.
He avoids people like you.
Prashant. Prashant.
Prashant.
Prashant.
Tejas.
Tejas.
There's going to be an explosion.
- There's going to be an explosion.
- When?
Today at 7.
Prashant.
Where, Prashant?
Janmabhoomi.
Ram Mandir.
Ram Mandir.
Thousands of people from around
the globe has arrived at Janmabhoomi.
The doors of the Temple
will open at 7 p.m.
The Supreme Court's decision
has put an end to all controversies.
Despite the decision,
there is a state of harmony
all over the nation.
Hindus and Muslims together
should be commemorated for this.
Soon the Home Minister's convoy
will arrive here.
Due to this, security is tight,
and the mood is celebratory.
Sir. Sir.
No! Sir...
We'll have to communicate
from the aircraft.
We are running out of time.
Hurry up.
Wait. Open the one up there.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me your stick.
Okay, let him through.
Hail Shri Ram!
Hail Shri Ram!
Hail Shri Ram!
Stop! Stop.
Stop! Stop.
I'm slowing you down.
Leave me behind.
You guys go.
We didn't come this far
to leave you behind.
Prashant, come on.
We can do this.
I cannot run anymore, Aafia.
I've no more energy left, please.
What are you guys waiting for?
Go on.
Go, goddamnit.
Run, Please.
Prashant,
would you have left me behind?
Yes.
I would.
Don't waste time arguing, Aafia.
Go.
We'll soar in the sky.
"Will commence the divine work"
Serve the nation with pride.
"Will fight for our glory"
"And be victories"
We'll soar in the sky.
We'll soar in the sky!
"Will commence the divine work"
Serve the nation with pride!
We'll soar in the sky.
Serve the nation with pride.
We'll soar in the sky.
Serve the nation with pride.
Serve the nation with pride.
Where the hell were you, Tejas?
There's going to be a blast
at the new temple at 7p.m.
Get the NSG Commandos
to Janmabhoomi now.
VAYU 1; Tejas, we're airborne.
Good.
Sir, any report on the ground mission.
The veneration doesn't start
for another 15 minutes.
We've to identify
and eliminate the terrorists
in these fifteen minutes.
Sir, if they succeed in carrying
out the blast, the entire country...
Tejas. There won't be any blast.
Sir, please keep me...
Missile, Missile, left...hard left.
Flares. Flares, now!
We are under attack.
Hail Shri Ram!
Hail Shri Ram!
Come on. Hurry up.
What took you so long?
Everyone else left for the veneration.
I've to prepare 'kheer' for everyone.
I was stuck in traffic, Baba.
Come on. Now hurry up.
We'll get delayed to reach the temple.
More missiles.
Roll missiles, on your left.
Rolling in for the attack.
SAM DOWN.
Over here. Good.
Javed. You are a good man.
Have some 'kheer' before you go.
Greetings, Baba.
We're in the storeroom.
Tejas, two bogies on my tail.
Copy, 100.
Two bogies on my right.
I am hit. I am hit.
Jettsson Tanks.
Fly closer to the surface.
Their radar won't be able to track you.
Oh shit, a missile has locked me.
Aafia!
Sir. We just traced a call
from the temple.
They were talking to someone in POK.
The call was made five minutes ago.
You should listen to this.
Javed, shoot him again.
And let me hear it.
I don't just want Kashmir.
I want the destruction of India.
My eyes want to see India burn.
My ears want to hear their children cry.
My hands want to grab their women.
My feet wants
to walk over their blown-up bodies.
This sounds like...
I want the destruction of India.
Khatooni.
Leave after four minutes.
When I give the orders.
Time it.
Run straight once you get out.
And detonate the bombs
at a distance from each other.
It will cause more bloodshed.
Yes, Baba.
Tejas, position.
1 o'clock high, using the clouds.
Abdul, try to get to the Ram Chabutra.
A blast over here is essential.
Yes, Baba.
If there is a blast in the temple,
Hindus will slaughter Muslims,
and Muslims will massacre Hindus.
We have to pit them against each other.
One India!
Incredible India.
But, Baba,
our Muslim brothers are out there too.
Doesn't matter.
Kill them too.
Don't think too hard, Abdul.
No visual contact yet.
- Is the blueprint of the temple ready?
- Yes.
Soon Lord Sri Ram's temple
will be inaugurated.
Javed,
show me the sight
of India's destruction in a minute.
The storeroom basement
and temple basement are connected.
Check the storeroom basement now!
Target located.
Three bogies.
Targets are hiding in the basement.
Target in sight.
Tejas, pulling into the sun.
Lost contact.
Can you see the enemy?
Right behind you.
"la ilaha illallah
muhammadur rasulullah."
"la ilaha illallah
muhammadur rasulullah."
Ground unit, stand down.
Targets are wearing suicide vests.
Repeat, stand down.
Do not charge.
Until you don't have a clear
head-shot, no one shoots.
If anyone's left behind,
he can detonate the bomb.
Positive. Ready to engage.
Positive.
Waiting for sniper one.
Negative. No clear head-shot.
Got him.
Engaging in 3...
2...
1... Fire.
Three down, check position.
The last one on my tail.
600 meters behind.
I am out of missiles.
Engage him in scissors.
But he's behind me.
Engage him.
Roger.
Two dead.
One target is still active.
Shit! Shit!
Ground unit, move in fast.
He's on my tail.
Where are you?
Coming.
Ground position, Aafia.
In a right turn,
I am crossing a bridge.
Contact with you.
Looking for F16.
On my left at 7 o'clock.
Contact with him.
Closing in.
Shoot him, damnit.
On my call, pull up Max G.
He's locked me.
He's locked me.
Pull up now.
All enemy aircrafts neutralised.
Great.
Sir, Janmabhoomi.
All three targets neutralised.
Yes.
Jai Shri Ram!
Jai Shri Ram!
The Ram Temple has finally
been inaugurated today.
The doors of the temple
have finally been opened.
Everyone in Janmabhoomi
is holding a flag today.
- and a lamp.
- Javed, come in. Javed come in.
Well done, Tejas,
Aafia, Prashant.
Mission Tejas is a success.
Wow, yeah.
Sir, who was the handler?
That bloody Khatooni.
The recent dossier
which India sent to Pakistan,
- was Khatooni--
- He was there.
Number one on the list.
And Pakistan's standard response was...
"He's not in Pakistan."
Sir, give me the coordinates.
What coordinates?
You know which coordinates I want.
Tejas,
you're two minutes away
from the Indian airspace.
Come back.
We'll get Khatooni later?
How will we get him later?
By sending dossiers to Pakistan?
You know that an angered
Khatooni will plan another attack.
Some temple, mosque or gurudwara.
Maybe Kashmir or Assam.
He'll target our soldier's convoy,
or our kids in school.
We killed three of his boys today.
But he will ready dozens more
in a week.
We need to get the mastermind.
We need to get Khatooni.
And if he leaves these coordinates,
we'll never get a second chance, sir.
Please give me the coordinates.
Tejas, do you even have
one missile on you?
Yes, sir. I have one last missile.
I can do this.
Sir, you said,
"When in doubt,
think about the nation".
Give her the coordinates.
Tejas,
I will wait for you in India.
Do you hear me?
34 degrees.
32 minutes, 59 seconds below.
Terrorist base locked. Engaging in.
Aafia.
Tejas, the radios are jammed.
We've lost contact with them due
to radio jamming.
My missile is stuck!
My missile is stuck!
My left tail wing is hit.
I won't be able to land back.
Tejas, eject now.
We will get you.
And the entire land of Janmabhoomi.
- is echoing with slogans of
'Jai Sri Ram'.
Turn it off!
I want to see these Indians burn!
I want to see these Indians burn!
I want to see these Indians burn!
Tejas, please. Eject now.
I can still do it.
How?
You don't have any missiles left.
I have one.
I still have one missile.
No, Tejas.
Tejas, please.
Just eject now.
Aafia, I've to go now.
I've made up my mind.
Tejas, please.
Respect my decision.
I am still your senior.
I want to see these Indians burn!
I want to see these Indians burn!
Prashant.
Yes, Tejas.
It's your life,
but would you do me a favour?
Anything for you, Tejas.
When you reach home,
don't go see some minister
or a friend...
Go see your superhero mom first.
Will you do it for me?
Absolutely, Tejas.
Aafia.
How about a filmy one-liner.
This is New India...
No one will ever say,
"Should have sent the boys".
Never!
Thank you.
Tejas, thank you.
Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!
I want to see these Indians burn!
I want to see these Indians burn!
We will soar in the skies...
The nation will remember us with pride.
As a soldier, what do I want?
Leave it. It's a big answer.
I'll speak from my heart,
and it will sound boring to you.
More of a lecture.
No, I want to know.
Leave it.
Tell me.
Please.
As a soldier, what do I want?
I want no soldier's sacrifice
to ever go waste.
A soldier has two families.
One of their own
and the other is this country.
Whether they make sacrifices
for their first family or not,
but makes several sacrifices
for the other family.
A soldier stands
at the border for months
if not years at the border
in minus 50 degrees.
You don't have to argue over standing up
for the 52-second national anthem.
Save that energy for the country.
To make it better.
I want everyone to consider this country
like a 3.2 million square kilometre home.
And treat it the same way.
If something isn't functioning,
don't just complain.
But also fix it.
If someone's arguing
on its beautiful streets,
then don't just make a video
and make it viral.
But try to stop them.
Every member of this family
should give love,
affection and respect to each other.
If you cannot love
this country as your mother,
then think of it as what
you love the most.
Because when you do that,
then no soldier's sacrifice
will ever go to waste.
That's all I want.
For my family
to be independent
and full of joy.
It's what every soldier wants.
