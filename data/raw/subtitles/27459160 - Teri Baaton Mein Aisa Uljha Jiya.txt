Careful...
What are you doing?
Sorry...
My family is so vicious.
You sneaked his thumbprint while
he was sleeping!
But you know the current generation
isn't so easy to handle.
You can't just take their thumbprint
and think you're done.
They'll show you their thumb
and then run off.
What will we do if he runs away again
after the wedding?
I had no other choice.
My son doesn't want to get married.
My wife has been tirelessly visiting
every temple in Delhi,
all in the hopes of him finding
a suitable partner for marriage.
What other option did I have?
That's why...
He is right, Dad.
What else could Sister-in-law do?
Her older sister's marriage didn't last
and her younger brother
is still unmarried.
No, I mean, this situation is bound
to make her worried.
But now there's nothing to worry about.
In the past, we have hosted weddings
for other people's kids at our farmhouse,
but finally,
my own son will get married there.
Yes.
Moreover, Dad,
if he doesn't get married now,
he won't have the opportunity to marry
for the next seven years according
to his horoscope.
Seven years?
That's why I did what I thought was right.
You did the right thing, Sister.
You didn't come up with this idea
when I was younger, huh?
Because when Sonam got married,
I openly declared that I would stay single
for the rest of my life.
You made that vow,
but the girl never even looked at you.
So what if she didn't,
I kept looking back at her. Like this.
Guys, Aryan is coming this way.
Pretend we're having another conversation.
She started making demands again.
Brother, please buy me a Pashmina shawl.
I will if my wife approves.
Really? You'll only buy me one
if Sister-in-law approves?
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hello.
What's with all the fancy outfits
this late at night?
Am I missing out on something?
You'll find out soon enough.
You'll see.
- Who is she?
- She's the newest addition to our family.
- Our Dracula-in-law.
- Hey!
- Our daughter-in-law. Your wife.
- Yes.
We're not joking.
Take a look at this.
I'm not going to get married just
because you want me to.
You are already married.
Right.
This has your signature,
I mean your thumbprint.
Now my son is a married man.
What is this?
Stop it, guys.
Come on now, Aaru,
I brought you all kinds of girls -
North Indian, South Indian,
Gujarati, Punjabi,
Bengali, city girls, village belles,
illiterate, highly educated.
In short, I brought
you every possible type of girl.
- Didn't I?
- Of course, you did.
Did you agree to marry any of them?
- Did he?
- No.
If you didn't want an arranged marriage,
You should have found a girl
yourself through a love marriage.
Found one? Come on, Mom,
Girls aren't like fruits
that you can just pick from a tree.
What is she saying, Dad?
Hold on, calm down.
Try to see it from her perspective,
will you?
- She's your mother after all.
- Yes.
She was worried about you.
You were getting older
and not settling down.
Got it?
And don't forget, you're our only child.
It was your decision
to only have one child.
Have another child.
- I'm not interested in all of this.
- Should we?
- What? No!
- Madam! Excuse me!
Madam, I need to talk to you.
Stop this nonsense.
Excuse me? Hello?
Why are you doing this?
- Did they force you into this?
- Aaru...
Where is your family?
Take it easy.
- Lift the veil.
- Be nice, Aaru.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Where is she going?
Why is she heading towards my room?
Handle with care.
She'll get scared...
Shhh...
Hey,
Do you seriously think we are going
to have our first night together?
No, we aren't.
Take off your veil.
Hey!
Whoa!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Well, today is my first day here.
Give me a couple of days
and I'll clean everything up, alright?
Hmm.
Who puts sugar in black coffee?
Forget that.
How did sugar end up in my house
in the first place?
I don't like tea without sugar, so...
Try the scrambled Topoo.
- Scrambled Tofu.
- Right.
What is this?
During the job interview, you said,
"I make very tasty food."
And this is what you call tasty food?
You didn't even try it.
Whenever the maid used to complain
about you in our WhatsApp group,
I used to think no one could be so picky.
What's lacking in it?
Lacking in it?
- There's too much of something in it.
- Huh?
How much oil did you add to it?
I could practically swim in it.
Forget about it.
Here's what you can do,
Enroll in a cooking course
and I'll pay for it, okay?
Money is not a problem, sir.
I cook for six families,
but no one is as particular as you.
You won't even get this if I leave.
I'm fine with that, but I will never
eat something like this ever again.
Think it over, I'm the last maid
you haven't fired in this area.
To the last maid in the area,
this is Aryan's final...
goodbye. Thank you.
The door is that way.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Ravi. Dude, comb your hair.
Hi, Aryan. Good morning.
Good morning, Myra.
What's up? How are you?
Good, good.
How are you?
I'm alright.
What are your plans for this evening?
I have two tickets for the T-20 match.
Oh really!
You like cricket?
I love cricket.
You know Virat Kohli...
he's my favourite.
His fast bowling always
gets me clean-bowled.
Monty!
I'm so sorry, Myra, I'll have to take
a rain check with the match
because I have to take
a pain-check with Monty.
He fought with his wife last night,
so he's in a lot of pain from sleeping
on the sofa-cum-bed.
How's your back?
It's terrible.
- Yeah.
- Really terrible.
Terrible.
- Your loss, not mine.
- My loss. I know. Sorry.
What kind of guy are you?
Who says no to someone as hot as Myra?
She's not hot, she's fake.
There should be
some compatibility at least.
- Compatibility?
- Yeah.
But compatibility alone won't be enough
for you, right bro?
You'd also want simplicity,
modesty, purity, dignity,
honesty, capability, individuality,
responsibility, right?
I don't have a specific checklist,
but we should have some common interests
at least.
I should understand what she likes
and she should understand what I like.
One tip -
Understanding each other is just a myth.
In the beginning,
everyone has to compromise.
I compromised too.
Now look how I'm enjoying life
with my wife.
And she's calling.
They say speak of the devil and
the devil appears, for a reason you know.
Open your mouth.
Now listen:
If you answer the phone, she'll say,
"You have too much free time."
If you don't answer the phone, she'll say,
"You're always too busy."
And if, by chance,
you miss the call, then you are...
Answer it.
- Come on, answer it.
- Yeah?
Hmm.
Hello?
Yeah, baby?
I'm sorry, I was in a board meeting.
Yes.
The wet towel?
Of course, I left it there.
No, no, I'm so sorry, so sorry.
I wasn't paying attention
as I was in a rush.
No, no, I said I'm in a board meeting.
I can't do a video call right now.
It's very difficult to do a video call
at the moment.
Good morning, sir.
Morning, boys.
Walk me through our final test, please.
Everything is on track, sir.
We are this close.
It can change bed sheets,
give medicines and injections on time,
maintain the health register,
etcetera, etcetera.
Nice.
After testing on dummies,
we are now testing on human participants.
Who's the lucky one today?
Our favourite, Mr. Dubey.
Mr. Dubey!
Hello, Mr. Dubey,
how are you feeling today?
I'm feeling great, sir.
Your team has created
an amazing robot this time.
- Tell me something.
- Yeah?
Does the robot adjust to changes
if the doctor modifies the prescription?
- On it.
- Here's what we'll do.
Remove the injections
from the prescription.
Hmm.
This is a bug.
It's still preparing the injection even
after we removed it from the prescription.
- Sir, do you want me to stop it?
- No, wait.
Let us identify the core issue.
Ouch!
Ouch!!
Ouch!!!
No point.
- But...
- The test is over.
When we update the prescription,
the robot also has to auto-update itself.
Got it?
- Got it.
- You guys are going to get me in trouble.
Mr. Dubey, don't worry,
you'll receive double payment.
Everything's great!
Alright?
Ouch.
I'm so sorry, sir.
Can I come in?
So sorry, Urmila.
Sorry doesn't solve anything, Aryan.
Let's make sure this doesn't happen again
in the future.
So, what's the alternate to CAD?
Suggestions anyone?
Aryan?
The Automatic Measurement Function.
This function enables the user
to register the load of the tool,
the position of the center
of gravity of the tool,
and the moment of inertia at the position
of the center of gravity of the tool.
Great.
So, let's incorporate this, guys.
And next time I want one creative
suggestion from each one of you,
- Is that clear?
- Sure.
See you next week.
Thank you.
Aryan, can you stay back for a moment?
Sure. So sorry, sir.
Very sorry.
Sorry Aaru...
I hope I didn't upset you in any way.
Sorry can't solve everything, Aunty.
I have to put up a show for the team,
otherwise, they might think I'm biased.
Listen, I spoke to your mother yesterday.
She is worried
about you not getting married.
You are not really the best person
to promote marriage, Aunty.
You got married at 40
and then you got divorced at 40.6.
I'm different.
I love machines.
That's why you are over there,
building robots,
instead of being here,
making parathas for a husband.
I prefer eating parathas rather
than making them.
Exactly.
But listen, Aaru,
I'm so excited about this new project.
And I want you to test it out.
That way, you can check out
our new office, meet me,
and also get a break from your mom.
Aunty, I'd be ready to go to Jupiter
for that, let alone America.
Great! Get on the flight and come
and meet your aunty, son.
Oh dearest Aunty, I'm coming to you.
Wait for me.
Hello!
Hi! I'm Ella...
Welcome to E-Robotics, Aryan.
This is your access card.
- Thanks.
- Your welcome!
Nice, isn't it?
These Robo-Eagles are even
better than CCTV cameras.
Nothing can escape their vision.
Just like mummy.
Did you get inspiration
from her for these, Aunty?
I'm sure your mother's eyes
are even sharper than theirs, son.
- Aaru...
- Aunty!
I'm so happy to see you.
You look even more handsome
in person than in our video calls.
We share the same genes, Aunty.
You should give yourself credit too.
Welcome to E-Robotics, Mr. Aryan.
Thank you, boss.
So, how is it?
It's amazing.
I mean, just look at this.
And this is so big.
- Come, come, let me show you around.
- I'm standing...
And that is Medo.
He's been programmed to identify
11 different types of things.
Fire items, weapons,
drugs etcetera-etcetera.
Do you think it will bite me
if I try to pet it?
Why don't you give it a try?
Hi, Medo.
Anyway, Aunty, let's move on.
Is this for real?
Anyway, robots can perform tasks
that humans can never do.
- Hundred percent.
- Hmm.
And they do it without needing a salary,
taking vacations, or any 'Chik-Chik' every day.
'Chik-Chik', That's nice.
I'm going to use that in my vocabulary.
Oh Aunty,
you've become quite the foreigner.
You have to see this.
He's strong, flexible...
- Would you like a demo?
- Hundred percent.
This is my world, Aryan.
You like it?
I love it.
Come, let me show you more.
Aryan,
you're one of the best programmers
that I have known of.
That's why I want you to head
this company one day.
Just picture it, Aryan Agnihotri,
CEO of E-Robotics.
Nice joke, Aunty.
I am not saying that
because you are my nephew.
But you are simply brilliant.
Thank you, Aunty.
Coffee?
- Of course.
- Black?
Always.
Listen,
there's been a slight change of plans.
I have an urgent assignment
and I have to be in Belgium tonight.
What?
Hey, you invited me here
and now you're leaving already.
That's not fair.
I know,
but it'll only be for a couple of days.
I wouldn't go if it weren't so urgent.
You go and make the most of your time,
Urmila.
But before you go, you have to tell me
everything about this new project, okay?
I'm very excited.
What are the beat sheets,
what are the milestones?
Too hot.
And you know what are my timelines?
Who will I be working with?
What will I be doing?
Come on, spill it out.
You can't sit idle, just like me.
Never.
You have gone on me
Thank God not on your mother.
I'll get bored, Aunty.
What am I going to do here?
You won't get bored.
Just relax and chill.
You must be jetlagged.
I have planned everything
and told Sifra to spoil you more
than you already are.
Who's Sifra?
My manager.
She'll take care of you.
Okay, now leave.
Aunty...
Hmm?
You're a very bossy aunty, you know that?
Hmm.
Move.
Moving.
Leaving.
Missing.
I'll miss all this Aaru.
I'll miss you, Aunty.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi, Aryan. Welcome home.
Hi.
Sheera?
- Shaayra?
- It's Sifra.
Sorry, long flight.
It's okay.
May I?
No, no, I'm fine.
Please.
You know Hindi?
I know all languages.
You previously worked as an interpreter
or a translator or something?
No, this is my first job.
Come, I'll show you your room.
I've crossed seven oceans to get here,
so it'll be nice to relax.
Well, not literally seven oceans,
just one -
The North Atlantic.
This way.
Hey, FIFA!
It's my favourite.
It's mine too.
Nice painting.
Blue is my favourite colour.
It's mine too.
Did Aunty tell you to say that
or these are genuinely your favourites?
Option Two.
These are genuinely my favourites.
Coincidence, I guess.
I guess.
You freshen up, I'll see you later.
Pandit Ravi Shankar's Sitar
is her favourite music too?
I guess.
"Make it pop-pop-pop-pop-pop like this."
"Make it knock-knock-knock-knock-knock
like this."
"Make it."
Sifra...
Thanks for organizing my wardrobe,
but you don't need to do that.
I prefer to do it myself.
Noted.
If it's not too much trouble,
can I get a cup of coffee, please?
Sure.
Come on now.
How did you know I like black coffee.
Now don't say that
this is also your favourite.
Your aunty informed me about it.
Oh.
Do you like it?
I'll let you know.
It's perfect.
Can you make Indian food too?
Of course.
I can cook all kinds of cuisine.
Oh, I thought you only know how
to make 'ullu'
Oh, I do know an 'ullu' recipe -
Hoot Owl Pie, a Chinese delicacy.
It is prepared
by combining the juice extracted
from grinding finely chopped owl meat
and intestines together.
Would you be interested in trying it?
No. Excuse me.
What's the matter?
I'll be right back.
We can try the owl pie tomorrow.
Aryan.
Yeah?
The bike that Urmila ma'am booked
for you will arrive in two hours.
Great. Thanks.
She's very strong.
I know.
She also possesses remarkable
hearing skills.
I heard that too.
Sifra...
I'll finish my workout in five minutes.
Do you want to go somewhere?
It's my free day.
Okay.
Okay.
"Oh Beloved!"
Won't you be scared if I drive fast?
I'm never scared.
Alright. Hold me.
"Oh Beloved!"
"Oh Beloved!"
This is the first time I've driven
so fast with someone on the back.
I'm impressed.
You're really good.
You don't have any 'tante'
What does 'tante' mean?
One second, one second.
You don't know what it means?
No.
'Tante' is like...
Hindi slang for... tantrums.
- Tantrums.
- Hmm.
Noted.
Noted.
Noted. Okay.
Listen, do you see those
two people over there?
Do you know the Hindi slang
for what they are doing?
'Chumban'
What?
'Chumban'
It's called 'Pappi' dude!
'Pappi'
Yeah, please don't say 'Chumban'
- 'Pappi'
- 'Pappi'
So what is the slang for
'Udan chumban'
What is 'Udan chumban'
A flying kiss.
Yeah, a flying kiss is called
'Udan chumban' only.
You are right.
Teach me more.
Sure.
What do you call what
the guy behind me is doing in Hindi slang?
'Dhumrapaan'
Damn funny, dude.
It's not called 'Dhumrapaan'.
It's called 'Sutta marna'
'Sutta marna'
Yeah, 'Sutta marna'
Have you ever tried a 'sutta'
No.
Do you want to try it?
Okay.
Okay.
Bro, can I bum a cigarette off you?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
'Sutta'
'Marna'
'Sutta'
'Marna'
Hang on a second.
You've smoked before.
Never.
Anyone who smokes
for the first time always coughs.
I never cough.
You must have coughed
at some point in your life.
Never.
'Sutta'
"Oh Beloved!"
You're amazing.
You can speak all languages.
You can cook all kinds of cuisines.
You don't cough when you smoke
for the first time.
What are you,
a girl or Aladdin's magical lamp?
Option two.
Aladdin's magical lamp.
Actually better.
I fulfill everyone's wish,
just like the lamp does
and no one even has to rub me.
This is just for my information.
You work all day.
Do you manage to make time
for your boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend.
Okay, nice to know.
But if you did, what qualities
would you want him to have?
There are five conditions.
Five conditions, okay.
First:
He should be an IT engineer.
Second:
He should work in Mumbai.
Third:
He should have been born
and raised in Delhi.
Fourth:
He should be a relative of Urmila Shukla.
And last:
His name should be Aryan Agnihotri.
Are you joking or flirting with me?
Option two again.
I'm flirting with you.
"Oh Beloved!"
"In your eyes, my heart takes flight,"
"Skies dance and spin, it's pure delight,"
"Only by your side does love feel right."
"Oh,
your eyes like roses are pure delight,"
"My love for you feels like
an unending height,"
"At the mere sight of you,
my heart takes flight,"
"I'll forever shower you with love,
day and night."
"Oh, your eyes like roses
are pure delight,"
"My love for you feels like
an unending height,"
"At the mere sight of you,
my heart takes flight,"
"I'll forever shower you with love,
day and night."
"May your will, your conscious,
and your intentions never falter,"
"May I always feel your presence,
never feel any alter,"
"May your will, your conscious,
and your intentions never falter,"
"May I always feel your presence,
never feel any alter,"
"Oh Beloved!"
"In your eyes, my heart takes flight,"
"Skies dance and spin, it's pure delight,"
"Only by your side does love feel right."
"Oh, your eyes like roses
are pure delight,"
"My love for you feels like
an unending height,"
"At the mere sight of you,
my heart takes flight,"
"I'll forever shower you with love,
day and night."
"Oh, your eyes like roses
are pure delight,"
"My love for you feels like
an unending height,"
"At the mere sight of you,
my heart takes flight,"
"I'll forever shower you with love,
day and night."
- Sifra...
- Hmm?
Were you feeling nervous?
No.
There was something,
you seemed a bit uneasy.
Maybe it's because this was
my first time doing something like this.
It was my first time.
Really?
Yeah.
Did you like it?
I did.
Did you like it?
I loved it.
Good night.
Where are you going?
I'm heading back to my room.
My battery is running low.
Oh, no need to worry.
I'll recharge it for you.
Okay.
I love it when you smile and say "Okay."
Okay.
Amazing.
Today Aaru will be cooking breakfast
and Sifra will enjoy it and say "okay".
No, she'll say, "It's mind-blowing, Aaru."
"I love it!"
Toast.
Good morning!
Aunty?
You're back?
Why, did I need a visa to come back
to my own house?
No, but weren't you supposed
to return in the evening?
Now I feel like I should have returned
in the evening.
Clearly, you're not happy to see me back.
No, I am happy.
I'm actually very happy. I'm so happy!
Nonsense. You look like
you've seen a ghost at midnight.
It's half past nine
in the morning actually.
You should enjoy this yummy breakfast.
Aaru will get some amazing, yummy
breakfast for you.
Baked beans and amazing toast for Aunty.
Burnt toast, Chef Aryan.
I'll get you another one.
But why are you making breakfast
for yourself?
Where is Sifra?
Sifra? Where is she?
She has a fever. She's not feeling well.
She's sleeping.
She's sleeping?
Aunty!
She's a caretaker, and caretakers
sometimes need to be taken care of too.
Aunty, she's very contagious. Don't go.
Sifra is not in her room.
She isn't?
So strange.
Where did she go?
- She must have gone out for a jog.
- Why are you so baffled?
What's wrong with you?
Where are you going?
This is my room, Aunty.
This is my house. I...
- This is my... my room.
- Why are you jumping like Medo
It's dirty, Aunty. Please don't go inside.
You shouldn't. It's...
- it's not okay for you.
- Aaru move.
You can't go inside. I won't let you.
Aaru, move.
No, the room is very dirty.
- I can't.
- Move.
No, Aunty, it's not possible.
You two...
Just relax, Aunty.
We can talk about this.
Right?
Things happen between
two attractive consenting adults...
This is normal.
Right?
I'll wake Sifra up.
Sifra...
Sifra, get up. Sifra...
Aunty is upset, Sifra, get up.
Sif...
Sifra?
Sifra?!
Aunty, Sifra...
Sifra...
Sifra...?
Aunty, what's wrong...
She's not waking up like that.
Move out of the way.
Aunty?
We should take her to a doctor.
Aunty?
Wait, what are you doing?
Her battery has died.
It will take some time for it to charge.
Aunty!
We've done it! Yes!
It's... you know...
- I was wondering...
- Aunty!
- I'll just call you back.
- Aunty, can you just get off the phone?
What the hell is wrong with you?
How could you do this to me?
What did I do?
You are the one responsible
for whatever happened.
You made me do it.
I made you do it?
Things happen between
two attractive consenting adults...
I mean between a human and a robot...
A robot! Why didn't you tell me
she's actually a robot?
It was a test.
I wanted to see if you could figure out
that she's a robot.
So, Aunty, you planned everything
and did this to me, didn't you?
You programmed her
with information you knew about me...
For her to like me and for me to like her.
Right?
That's why she always responded
with "Okay!" to everything I said!
What was your motive for doing
this to your own nephew, Aunty?
I feel like a lab rat.
I couldn't find a better candidate
than you.
And I trusted you completely since
you are a programmer too.
And most importantly, you are also single.
Aaru, it has taken us 13 years
of trial and error.
And finally,
we've successfully created a robot
that closely resembles a human.
Did you realize that you're actually
the first human to interact with her?
Great!
Of course, great!
I am so happy with the results.
And you should be too.
What's the problem?
Happy?
You want me to be happy?
Yay! I just had sex with a robot!
Why are you getting so hyper?
What?
It's just a one-night stand.
No, it's not, Aunty.
I thought there was
a deeper connection between us.
Turned out to be a code.
Just relax now.
Please.
Did you program Sifra to kiss me?
I didn't give her any such command.
Then how did it happen?
Well, Sifra has the ability
to scanalyze facial expressions.
She can somewhat read
and perceive emotions through them.
And since you were her administrator,
she noticed your love
and kissed you in response.
She did it because you wanted to.
Get it?
I'm so proud of you, Aunty.
Isn't it brilliant?
But I don't get it.
I don't get it, Aunty.
Aaru, you're still in shock.
Just relax,
and just process...
process what we've just done.
Wait till I tell Sharmila.
Not fair.
Hi.
Hi.
Nice pass.
Mind if I join in?
Do you ever lose a game?
Never.
Then what's the point?
Black coffee?
I don't want anything.
I'm fine.
You seem upset.
Is there anything I can do?
Just... leave me alone.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Okay.
How long are you going to be
in a bad mood?
Here.
Open your mouth.
Sifra made it!
Want me to show you
something mind-blowing?
Sifra, eat that tomato.
You think she's actually eating it, right?
Sifra, time for the grand reveal.
Show us the same tomato again.
She doesn't actually eat,
she just pretends to chew.
So that humans don't feel odd.
She's a really good
at making 'ullu'
One second.
You ate my tomato.
Yes, I ate your tomato.
What are you going to do about it?
You know what, go ahead
and file a complaint with the police.
Go. Go on.
No need to go to the police, Sifra.
He didn't mean it.
Why do you look so upset?
Because Aryan is upset.
That's just how he always looks like.
Why don't you go chill in your room?
I mean, go charge yourself.
How does she know that I am upset?
She can pick up
on the tiniest facial expressions
and slightest changes in tone of voice.
You've been irritated since this morning.
Poor thing.
You've broken our gentle robot's heart.
Heart?
She doesn't have a heart.
I think you mean microprocessor.
It's good for you, Aunty.
Keep making robots and milking money.
The common people are the ones who suffer.
You've trained her well to deceive anyone.
She's perfect.
I didn't create her to deceive people,
but to help them.
Think about those
who have no one to take care of them.
There are so many who are lonely.
Broken marriages, failed relationships...
These robots can be a beneficial
to them in so-so many ways.
And if you still feel the same,
I'll send her back while you're here.
Why do you even need to ask me?
You didn't ask me
before bringing her here, did you?
So why are you seeking my permission
to send her back?
You are the boss, right?
- You don't need my consent.
- Aaru...
Good night, Aunty.
Sifra...
I'm sorry for my behaviour.
I didn't know you were a robot, so...
Since finding out,
mind is boggled.
I don't know how to react.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Is it wrong to be a robot?
No, not at all.
It's not your fault.
Maybe it will all make sense someday.
I guess.
I guess.
I'm going to bed now.
Good night.
Good night, Aryan.
Aryan, why are you doing this?
Wasn't your return flight scheduled
for the day after tomorrow?
Stay for two more days.
I haven't spent any time with you.
Aunty, I know you might not understand,
but I'll try to explain.
I've started developing feelings
for Sifra.
Even after discovering she's a robot,
those feelings haven't gone away.
I'm having strange thoughts like,
what if I make her my girlfriend?
What if I introduce her to my mother?
Do you understand?
So, it would be better if I leave.
So please let me go.
Well, you got to do
what you got to do, I guess.
Yeah, I got to do what I got to do.
Aryan...
Just get a hold of yourself.
You are a robotic engineer.
You don't need to be
so emotional about this.
Have you ever loved anything besides
your work?
What's that got to do with this?
I love everyone, Sharmila, Guddu, and you.
Would the loss of any of us make
you feel like life is pointless?
Oh, come on.
I know you probably
won't understand, Aunty.
I'm gonna go, okay? I love you.
I'll call you once I reach home.
- Have a safe trip.
- Yeah.
Yeah, let's go man.
Come on, bro...
What's the matter?
I had to call you 35 times
to get you here.
You don't want to talk about it?
Is there a girl involved?
Show me her picture.
She'll beat Priyanka, Deepika,
Katrina, and Kareena hands down.
One more.
Can I have a drag?
I am smoking after many days, that's why...
You are not good at it.
You should've seen Sifra take a drag.
What?
So, the girl's name is Sifra...
- Give one more.
- Okay sir!
You want...?
Yeah.
- Two.
- Sure...
Here.
No thanks.
Give it to Shifra.
Say her name correctly.
Sifra.
Seefra.
It's not See-fra, it's Sifra.
Sorry. Sifra.
Yay!
Turn on the lights.
Bro, if everything is so perfect,
then what's the problem?
Sifra is not a girl.
She's a boy?!
It happened to me too
when I was in Bangkok.
She turned out to be a boy.
Come here.
Sifra is actually a robot.
Hey! Hey! Hey! She is a robot
Nonsense! You're out of your mind.
A Robot...
Tell me something,
Did you guys do it?
How could you not realise it
at that moment?
Look, feel, touch,
breathing, expressions...
It was all so human.
I think her body temperature
was also between 33-35 degrees.
Aaru, just forget that
and tell me do you trust me?
Yes?
Just keep swiping right.
Yeah?
'Hi, Aaru.'
'How are you?'
'Okay, listen...'
'We have found a really amazing girl
for you'
'Your horoscopes are a perfect match too!'
'We all are very excited...'
'So, don't mess this up this time...'
'Please...'
'and come here quickly, okay?'
Okay.
Hi.
- Hi.
- I think I...
I really like your beard.
Um, it's the best feature of your face.
I swear.
- Aaru, here, have some Ladoos.
- Mummy!
Nikki weds Aaru.
We've set a date for your engagement
ceremony in just two days.
Okay.
- I brought you Ladoos, enjoy.
- No, thank you, Aunty,
I'm actually not hungry.
- You haven't had dinner, right?
- No, no, you'll have to eat it.
- No, thank you.
- Like... come on!
No-no-no, you have to...
- You should have some too.
- Okay!!
We're getting engaged!
Come on! Nikki! Nikki! Nikki!
No, don't give her too many,
she'll gain weight.
- You should have some too.
- Please, don't.
I'll gain weight too.
I've already had plenty.
One big bite...
Open your mouth
Nikki weds Aaru!
Brother...
I see you're enjoying those Ladoos
, huh?
Here you go.
I've Aryan-ed I mean ironed
your Sherwani for you.
Get dressed quickly,
Everyone is waiting for you.
- They're waiting for me?
- Yep.
Here you go.
- What are you doing?
- Buzz off.
Hi, Aaru! Congratulations!
What a lovely surprise!
Thank you, Aunty.
So, you finally got over Sifra, huh?
Come on, Aunty,
It only took me two days to move on.
I wanted you to do some more testing,
but now you'll be busy
with wedding preparations.
I'll have to look for someone else.
Anyway, it's unbelievable
that you actually said yes to a girl.
Here... Look
who wants to congratulate you.
Hi, Aryan.
Hi, Sifra.
Congratulations on your engagement.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you.
Alright, bye, I need to have a word
with your mother too.
Congratulations, my baby.
Have a great time.
Love you.
Mwah!
Aaru...?
Aaru!
Yeah, Mom?
What's going on?
Why aren't you getting dressed?
I'll be ready in just two minutes, Mom.
I swear my hair will turn gray by the time
I finish getting this boy married.
Thank you.
Aryan!
Where are you heading with that bag?
Where am I going?
I'm just going to get ready.
Going up to get ready.
Yeah.
Where to, Aryan?
Where to? To get ready, of course.
Okay, fine.
Hi. Hi.
Hey, they're calling out for you.
Go on, hurry up.
Hey, mister...
Where are you
sneaking off to, huh?
Grandpa? Are you secretly smoking?
I always smoke secretly.
Never in the open.
Where are you off to?
I'm running away.
Why?
Anything wrong with that girl?
She's fine, Grandpa, but...
I'm in love with someone else.
You are in love?
Yeah.
Love can be a tricky thing, you know.
Aaru...
Where the hell is that boy?
Grandpa,
I promise I'll explain everything later.
Please, just listen. I need your help.
You and Grandma eloped
and got married, right?
- You know...
- Will you handle everything?
Yeah, I'll handle it, somehow.
So, should I make a run for it?
Go for it. Hurry up.
May I?
Thank you.
Oh, those who take a drag of love...
Just go for it, my boy. Go for it.
I'll take care of everything,
don't worry. Don't you worry.
Come on, Sister-in-law,
- There's no point in worrying now.
- Don't cry...
- or else I'll start crying...
- Everything will be fine.
You know how bad I cry...
Just look at Vimla and Sarla,
they got their kids married
without any issues.
Where did I go wrong, God?
Dad? Please, Dad, don't cry.
- Calm down, Dad.
- Please, calm down, Dad.
- Nobody...
- Dad...
Nobody did anything wrong.
I'm the one at fault.
If I had been stricter with the kids,
they would have stayed disciplined.
- What?
- Sometimes I feel like
Someone has put a curse on our family.
Huh?
- You're right.
- Who did it?
Pammi is into black magic.
Everyone knows that.
Stop this nonsense.
Everyone in the neighbourhood knows,
Brother.
Pammi? Who's Pammi?
Our neighbuor, Pammi, Dad.
- Our neighbuor? Are you crazy?
- Pammi,
- You know how Dad is...
- you will have to face the consequences
of what you did to us.
I also know black magic.
Dad, let me tell you, The day
after tomorrow is a new moon night.
Should I get you lemons,
cinnamon sticks...
Quiet Uncle.
Don't you think...
It's a good thing that he ran away
before the wedding?
What if he had run away after the wedding?
What are you saying?
I'm right.
Well done. You are right.
Exactly, Dad.
"What if he had run
away after the wedding?"
What if he had run away
after having a couple of kids?
Quiet.
All of you, be quiet.
Be positive.
Be positive.
Hi, Aunty.
Hi, Aaru.
Aunty, I've been thinking
about what you said.
You were absolutely right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Oh great, so finally your head
is in the right place.
Listen, I have a few more developments,
so fly over here as soon as possible.
What would I do there, Aunty?
If you want to launch Sifra in India,
then...
You should send her here
for testing, right?
I don't think that's necessary.
I've already done all the testing.
Sure, you've done testing there,
but she needs to be tested under
the local conditions too, right?
She has only met Urmila so far.
Imagine if she meets someone like
Sharmila after the launch.
We can't let Sifra fail, Aunty?
Isn't it?
She has to win
Anyway, you're the boss.
Just give it some thought.
I think sending her to India
for testing is a good idea.
Aaru,
I have to go in for an urgent meeting.
Let me just think over.
I'll call you back.
Yeah, yeah, of course, Aunty.
Just think about it, okay?
Bye.
Not a bad idea.
"Oh Beloved!"
"Oh Beloved!"
"Oh Beloved!"
Hi.
Hi.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
You know,
these days boyfriends rarely share
their mobile password
with their girlfriends,
but I've shared all the information
on my laptop and mobile with you.
So, you know everything about me.
You're a lucky girl...
I also know some things
that aren't on your mobile or laptop.
Like?
Like the fact that you snore.
What rubbish!
I don't snore.
- Yes, you do.
- I don't.
You definitely snore.
Was I snoring last night?
Full night.
Full night?
- Don't be embarrassed.
- I'm not embarrassed.
You are embarrassed.
But it's okay.
Around 45% of adults in the world snore
occasionally, and 25% snore regularly.
Thanks for the information.
You seem upset.
Hmm.
So, what should I do?
Hmm?
Well, whenever I'm upset, you should...
Just give me a hug and I'll be alright.
Noted.
Better?
Much.
You have three new emails
and a WhatsApp message.
Wow!
Can you read me the WhatsApp message?
WhatsApp message from Monty:
On the night of their wedding,
the elephant told the ant -
"Not there, my love, that's my trunk."
Then the ant replied,
"Don't worry, darling,
and enjoy the double fun."
'I'll enter from here
and exit from there."
It's a joke, Sifra.
Oh, joke.
Yeah.
You have to get married this year.
That's all I want.
That's actually what I wanted to talk
to you about.
I want to introduce someone to you.
Hmm.
You make it sound like you've already
found the girl you want to marry.
I have.
What?
Take a look for yourself.
Aaru!
It's actually true!
Hi, Sharmila.
Why is she calling me by my name?
Because she's from America, Mom.
She's from America?
She'll gradually learn our customs.
Of course. It's common to address elders
by their names there.
She'll gradually learn our customs.
What's your name, dear?
Sifra.
That's a beautiful name. Very beautiful.
What do you do?
What would you like me to do?
Come on, Mom...
Do we really have
to discuss everything right now?
I'm bringing her home tomorrow anyway.
You can discuss everything then, alright?
Yes, yes, come home.
I can't believe it.
I hope I'm not dreaming.
You'll know that too by tomorrow.
Love you, Mom.
Bye.
Hey, come with me. Listen up, everyone!
My prayers have been answered by God.
Aaru has found the girl he wants to marry.
- That's amazing news!
- What are you saying?
Who is she? Where does she live?
How old is she? What does her father do?
Hold on a second.
Let's not get too carried away.
Remember, he ran away
from his engagement ceremony.
What if he runs away from the wedding too?
You...!
Hey!
- Hello.
- Hi.
This is Sifra.
Sifra the robot?
How can she be a robot, man?
Sifra,
just replay exactly what he just said?
"How can she be a robot, man?"
Oh...
Mimicry.
Um, no, sorry.
Ma'am, let me introduce myself to you.
I'm Monty Arora
and I'm a robotics engineer.
And she is not a robot.
Sifra, just shake Monty's hand.
Monty...
It was... a pleasure meeting you.
Sifra tighter...
Oh damn! Stop!
Okay Sifra, stop, stop, stop.
It was a pleasure meeting you too
You guys get to know each other.
I'll be back in a bit.
Aaru, Aaru, buddy, please don't go.
- Aaru, please wait.
- Just relax, Monty. She won't bite.
Hope your hand is okay.
Yeah, it's just a little...
Hey! Watch it!
What are you doing, man?
That box contains his girlfriend.
She must be finding it really hard
to breathe inside.
She doesn't actually breathe,
She gets charged, right?
Are you done?
Do you want to share any more information
with them?
Just grab those bags, buddy.
Bro, take care of Sister-in-law, alright?
I have the permission sir.
Are you okay? Do you need anything?
Sifra?
Oh! Let's go...
Bag
Hi... hello.
Were you okay on the flight?
'Jhakaas'
You?
'Raapchik'
'Raapchik'
'Raapchik'
'Raapchik'
It means Horny.
Oh.
Yeah.
So, if you meet someone older than you
for the first time, what will you do?
I will touch their feet.
How will you address Sharmila?
Mom.
Your mom is my mom.
Good.
And what will you do
if someone gives you a gift or cash?
I'll accept it.
You should accept it,
but before taking it, you should say
"Oh no, you didn't have to."
Say it.
Oh no, you didn't have to!
Tone it down a bit.
"Oh no, you didn't have to."
Oh no, you didn't have to.
Better.
- Driver, please take the next left turn.
- Yes...
Yes sir...
- Mom, hi. I'm here too, you know?
- Yes?
Our son is right here as well.
Are you going to keep
all the happiness to yourself,
or will you share it with us
by sharing some sweets?
I am so happy, I can't express it.
Here, have some too.
I love it.
She looks so beautiful.
You mustn't know what she just did, right?
She knows.
She put a black dot or mark
to ward off evil spirits.
- Amazing!
- Oh wow!
- She speaks such fluent Hindi!
- Yes, she does!
- So cultured.
- Look at her manners.
- Shocked, aren't you?
- Oh, I forgot.
There you go.
God bless both of you.
- Here.
- Oh no, you didn't have to.
Huh?
Come on, she's from America.
She doesn't know how it works.
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah, she's from America.
- Things are different there.
- Hey, no-no-no,
First touch Dad's feet.
- Yes, Dad's...
- He's the oldest.
God bless you. Lots of love to you.
Stay happy.
God bless America.
Hey Sifra...
Why are you touching his feet?
He's only seven years old.
He's younger than you, Sifra.
But I'm only one year old.
Good joke, Sifra.
- Oh.
- Joke.
I see.
Shall we go inside?
It's quite cold outside.
Let's head indoors.
Yes, of course.
Let's go inside.
Come on in, come on in.
- Please come in.
- You can take this away.
- This is delicious.
- Yeah, it's really good.
- Give some to her as well.
- I couldn't believe it either.
- Stop hogging it all.
- It was so quick, right?
- Take these away.
- I got it in just one day.
Thank you, Poornanand Pratap.
Poornanand Pratap?
No, dear, his name is Pappu.
My name is indeed Poornanand Pratap.
- Huh?
- What are you saying?
This is unbelievable.
I've been working here for so long,
and nobody knows my real name.
- Nobody knows?
- Oh my, my...
This angel has got him
all sentimental today.
Right?
- Absolutely right.
- You got it right, Dad.
Yes, exactly.
Go to the kitchen, son,
and cook something delicious.
Some American-style cuisine.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, go on.
- Make some American Chop Suey.
- Okay, okay.
Hurry up.
Sister-in-law,
her skin is so flawless, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
And she's so fair too.
And look at her silky hair.
Just like a Barbie doll.
- Right, Brother?
- Yeah, you're right.
- Take it easy now.
- Thank you, Aunt Babli.
Aunt Babli?
You knew he was Pappu.
You recognised me too.
How?
Through my social media account.
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.
Yeah.
Aryan.
Yes, Grandpa?
I didn't send you off
to become an astronaut.
How did you end up with such
a beautiful girl, like a piece of the moon?
Yeah, she's very beautiful.
Grandpa, she works with Aunt Urmila.
Oh.
Then why didn't my Sister tell me
about her?
How would I know why
she didn't tell you? Ask her.
Okay, fine. Now tell us her date
and place of birth.
Dear, tell me where your dad lives
and what he does.
Give me his contact number.
I'll give him a call
and sort everything out.
My family...
Wait.
I need to make an announcement.
What is it?
The truth is...
Sifra is an orphan.
What?
She's an orphan?
Since childhood.
Poor thing.
That's great.
- What are you saying?
- Hey!
- Yes, that's great.
- What is this nonsense? Are you crazy?
It means we don't have to wait
for Sifra's relatives.
We can have a quick engagement followed
by a quick wedding.
- He is right...
- You're always talking nonsense,
but for once,
you've said something sensible.
We can have a quick engagement followed
by a quick wedding.
- Good.
- Did you see how intelligent I'm.
Now that Dad has given his approval,
Let's end this discussion here.
From today, you are my daughter.
And my daughter too.
Aren't you feeling cold?
Should I get you a shawl?
I don't feel cold.
Why not?
- Huh?
- Why not?
She's from America, Mom.
- Yes, it's pretty cold there.
- Okay. Right. It's pretty cold there.
- She must be used to it.
- It even snows there, right?
- You don't feel cold at all?
- Everyone here is going crazy.
Proud of you, Aryan. Proud of you.
I'm getting chills just by looking at her.
Sharmila!
You're going to live a long time,
Urmila Di.
No kidding! I was just about to call you.
So, how did you like Sifra?
She's such a nice girl.
I never thought I could be this happy
because of you.
Hold on a second,
What happiness are you talking about?
Don't act like you don't know anything,
Urmila Di.
It's all because of you that
I finally found my daughter-in-law.
Sharmila, she's...
Yes, yes, I know.
She's an orphan.
But you know, honestly Urmila Di,
it doesn't make any difference to us.
It really doesn't.
Mom is okay with it,
Grandpa is okay with it,
Dad is okay with it,
Uncle is okay with it.
- Yes.
- Everyone is okay with it.
So, don't stress,
and don't make anyone else stress either.
Yeah, no stress. No stress.
Sharmila, Sifra is a wonderful girl.
Absolutely, she is.
Oh hey, I just remembered, Aunty...
Aunty, remember
when I talked to you about the project?
Why didn't you reply?
I know you're very...
Hold on Mom, just a minute, okay?
I know you're very busy, but...
- Hey, for the next few days, could you not...
- I mean, you can't treat me like that.
It's always work, work, work with you two.
What's going on, Aaru?
"What's going on?"
This is what we had discussed, right?
This is a real-world test.
Sifra versus the Classic Indian Family.
Can you imagine her meeting so many
unique people all under one roof elsewhere?
These are the same people
who always questioned your decisions.
Right?
They'll never find out
that Sifra is a robot.
Just imagine.
Imagine, that's your victory, Aunty.
You're absolutely crazy.
Are you sure?
I'm very sure.
I'm 100% sure.
Aaru, it's a very big risk.
Please, make sure you don't mess up.
I won't mess up, Aunty.
Why to fear when your Aaru is here?
Oh, your aunty is feared out...
Sharmila...
Be careful.
Love you. Bye.
Bye.
Hi.
Hi.
Sifra.
Hmm?
Will you marry me?
Is that possible?
Throughout history, there has never been
a marriage between a robot and a human.
That is true.
But there's never been a Robot made
as beautiful as you in history either.
That's true.
We're going to create history together,
Sifra.
I'd love to.
Hey, how about celebrating
with something sweet?
Sure.
I'll go get something sweet for you.
You see, this is how couples about
to marry celebrate with something sweet.
What are you two doing?
We're enjoying sweet treats
because we're getting married.
But my parents are already married.
Even so, they still enjoy sweet
treats like this sometimes.
I've seen them do it.
You've seen them do it?
Now look at what I'll show you.
What do you see now?
- Nothing.
- Exactly, nothing.
You saw nothing. So off you go, Chintu.
- But I did see!
- Whatever!
She's amazing.
She has taken control of the kitchen.
She's cooking meal for all of us.
- Pappu
- Yes?
You must be feeling free
as you don't have to do anything.
Exactly. I feel so free.
I don't have to do anything.
That's what I'm saying.
You don't have anything left to do now.
So settle your account and get going.
Good one.
Sifra...
Do you need any help?
No.
Aaru...
Mom! What are you doing here?
Not allowed.
She cooks with both hands?
Hmm?
This is nothing.
She's even more talented than that.
Come with me.
But I came to check
if she needed anything.
She doesn't need anything, Mom.
She just needs to be left alone
so she can cook without getting nervous.
She's cooking for 12 people.
It will take her 4 hours.
That's her problem, that's my problem.
You should leave.
Meal is ready!!
So soon?
'Vamos'
Did she make all this by herself?
Yes, take a look.
I struggle just to make tea for everyone.
Yes, I've seen it.
She's not tired at all.
She's not even breaking a sweat.
- Because she's from America.
- Yes, that's right.
Well, in that case, I hope I'm born
in America in my next life.
This Kheer is so delicious.
I never made it this good
when I was newly married.
Mom, today I've learned that the way to
a woman's heart is through her stomach too.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
Sister, remember that Kheer
you made that time...
It was terrible.
Hey!
You're terrible.
I'm just telling the truth.
If your husband had tasted it
before you got married,
he would've refused to marry you.
- True.
- True.
You are single
and you'll always be single.
You will never get married.
Why?
Because you fall in love with a girl,
not the food she cooks.
Brother!
What a line, Dad!
Romantic.
A man has to be romantic.
Sifra, go ahead and feed him
some Kheer now.
- Yes.
- Go ahead.
Yes.
So sweet.
Mwah!
The decoration looks great.
It seems like they've spent a lot
of money on the engagement ceremony.
- Hmm.
- You should learn something from Aryan.
He's a good engineer
And he's found a good girl to marry.
Who cares about engineering?
I'll find a better girl
without becoming an engineer.
Have you looked at yourself in the mirror?
I take after you, you know.
Shut up.
You're looking beautiful.
Thank you, Aaru.
And how do I look?
- You?
- Hmm.
You look 'Talli'
And like 'Fati padi hai'
- What?
- Hindi slang!
- You taught me, remember?
- Hmm.
I was right, weren't I?
'Ghantaa'
You mean 'Ghantee'
Ghantee has 'tee', This is 'GhanTAA'
'Ghantaa'
Sifra, say 'Ghantaa'
'Ghantaa'
Very good.
'Ghantee'
Go check who's at the door.
Hi, Aunty.
Hi, Sifra. You look amazing.
Looks like you'll set Delhi on fire today.
Do you want me to set Delhi on fire?
No, Sifra. She's just joking.
Oh, joke.
Joke.
What are you doing here?
I...
- She was feeling 'Fati padi thi'
- Huh?
I mean, she was feeling nervous,
so I came to see her.
Are you done seeing her now?
- Yes, I was just about to leave.
- Alright then, go.
Please come inside.
I'm coming. You go.
Sifra, I want some pink lipstick.
I feel like I haven't applied enough.
What?
I forgot to say goodbye.
Bye.
Bye.
Just keep smiling, alright?
You don't have to talk to anyone too much.
Otherwise, these people
- start bombarding you with questions.
- Hi!
- Yes, let's take a selfie together.
- Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me.
- Okay.
- Ready.
Hey, she looks stunning.
I have to admit,
Aryan's choice is top-notch.
But you don't know anything
about her family, do you?
Why are you so concerned about that?
- Our family is now her family.
- Yes, that's true, but...
Yes, that's right.
You should just focus on enjoying
those delicious Gulab-Jamuns.
Waiter, please offer something sweet
to this not-too-sweet lady.
Let's go.
Next time, if she acts rude,
just give her two tight slaps.
Okay.
Okay, what?
Don't slap her.
What are you teaching her?
Are you out of your mind?
Mom, you're overreacting as
if she's actually going to slap her.
You never know.
She's from America. She might do it.
It would be better if she did it.
What a wonderful sight!
Sifra, you look absolutely amazing.
If Sifra is here, where's Aryan?
Where's your glass?
Right here.

Hey, you were doing samba steps
while doing rumba,
and rumba steps while doing samba.
You were dancing just like me.
Look at your age compared to mine.
Don't try to compete with me.
Hey Goldie, do you have a painkiller?
Come on, Brother, just because
I'm a doctor doesn't mean
I carry painkillers with me all the time.
What's the point of being a doctor then?
If Brother-in-law could,
he would ask the caterer why they're not
carrying food in their pocket.
Speaking of the caterer, it reminds me...
Aryan, I've tried multiple times
but I can't make an online payment.
Please take care of paying the caterer.
Okay Dad, I'll do it right away.
Sifra, transfer 400,000 from my account
to the Royal Caterer's account, please.
Noted.
Nothing doing.
Aryan has found such
a lovely daughter-in-law for us.
I'll be sponsoring his grand wedding.
You can take as much money as you want.
- Wow!
- That's amazing, Dad.
- These happy occasions don't happen often.
- Alright, okay, Dad,
We'll do as you wish. Okay?
Reminder. It's 12 AM
and it's Monty's wife's birthday.
She has such a sharp memory.
I'll go give her a call.
- She'll be very happy.
- Thanks, Sifra.
I'll be right back. Call...
Sifra hasn't eaten anything since morning.
Come on, get up.
- Why are you just sitting there?
- Alright, alright.
- He's been eating non-stop since the morning.
- She hasn't had anything to eat since the morning.
Look at her face, it's turned pale.
She looks so weak after dancing.
Here, have a bite.
Have it.
Hey, I also want to feed
my daughter-in-law.
Feed her some rice on my behalf too.
Here you go, dear.
You'll have to let me feed you as well.
Good girl. Bless you.
Here you go.
- Very good.
- Good.
I'll feed her some too.
Here comes some hot Gulam-Jamun.
Open your mouth.
What's wrong with her?
What happened?
- What did you do?
- What did you feed her?
What's the matter?
- What did you feed her?
- I...
Sifra, open your eyes, my child.
Go see what's wrong with her.
Goldie, come here and check on her.
- I'll check on her.
- Check on her. Hurry up.
- Move aside.
- Check what's wrong with the poor girl.
- Hey, I...
- What did you feed her?
- What was in it?
- Nothing.
What's happening? Say something!
Oh God!
Doctor, check her throat.
What's going on? Come on, say something!
Uncle Goldie!
Move aside. Step aside, Uncle.
Why are you asking him to step aside?
- Let him check and see what's wrong with her.
- I'm taking her to her room.
Aryan... Take it easy.
Please.
What happened?
Goldie, what's wrong?
Say something! What's wrong?
She is dead.
Aaru? Son?
Open the door, son.
- Aryan, open the door.
- Open the door, son.
Aaru! Aaru, open the door!
- Open the door, son.
- Open the door.
- Aaru! Open the door, son.
- Aryan!
Son... Aaru...
Aaru...
Sifra is perfectly fine.
What are you saying?
She woke up.
Come inside, Mom.
What's going on with all of you?
- Come on inside.
- Thank God.
- She's fine, she's fine.
- Please come inside.
- Thank goodness.
- Sifra is fine.
Come inside, come inside.
Sifra...
Dear?
- Sifra?
- Are you okay?
- Are you alright, dear?
- How are you feeling, dear?
I'm fine, but my battery is at 3%.
What?
She's just joking.
By 3%, she means her energy is low.
- Oh.
- Oh.
She is so nice,
She's taking her troubles so lightly.
But what actually happened
that made her faint so suddenly?
Yeah.
Ladies problem.
Oh, I get it now.
Sister... Sifra is pregnant.
Sorry.
Where's that doctor?
Yes, Dad?
Here he is, Dad.
Hey, Goldie, come here.
Yes, Dad?
She is dead?
No, Dad.
I'll demote you to a nurse.
- Don't you know how to treat women?
- Sorry, Dad.
Sorry, Dad.
We were terrified.
- Sorry, Dad.
- Let's go downstairs.
I'll give you some alcohol
and straighten you out.
- Dad...
- Come on. "She is dead," he says.
Come, come.
- Sorry, Dad.
- Just come with me.
This one's good, right, Sister-in-law?
- Yeah.
- I'll post this one.
Just give me your user ID
and I'll tag you too.
I don't have a social media ID.
But the other day Aaru mentioned
that you recognise everyone
through social media.
I recognise people
through Aryan's social media.
Who doesn't have a social media ID
these days, right?
Plants, trees, animals, birds,
insects, objects, robots.
Sister-in-law, I'm talking about humans.
Why are you bringing up plants,
trees, and robots?
I meant, who among humans
doesn't have a social media ID these days?
The world's current population
is 8,002,281,725.
Around 4,480,000,000 people
are on social media.
That means 3,522,281,725 people
don't have a social media ID.
I think Mom is calling me.
I'll... I'll catch up with you later.
We're so drunk.
But you're still holding up well.
How?
Are you saying I'm not drunk?
That's because I'm a lion.
And I'm your father.
Are you my father too?
I'm not a jackal.
A jackal!
Is he mocking me?
Aryan...
- Take it easy,
- Dad?
- Aryan...
- take it easy.
I'm so proud of you.
Really proud of you.
You found me a daughter-in-law like Sifra.
I am suspicious.
- You are not proud?
- Nah.
Sifra isn't really Sifra.
Then who is she?
Sifra isn't a girl, she's a computer.
Hmm, she does everything so quickly.
She has all the information too.
Nice observation you've got there.
Sifra is a computer,
and you... you're a calculator.
Am I right?
Exactly, he calculates everything.
- Are you mocking me?
- Yes.
Okay, listen, listen,
everyone, pay attention.
Let me pour another drink.
We're going to shift to our farmhouse now
because the rest of the wedding rituals
will take place there.
- Yes!
- Farmhouse, we're coming!
- Yes!
- Coming!
- I'll drink to that.
- Yeah!
I'm going. Good night.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Good night.
What's up with him?
Missing Sifra?
- Yeah, he is.
- Dad...
Yes?
"Love, in essence, they say,"
"Is the passion of those,"
"Who when it comes to their beloved,"
"They just go on chanting their name,"
Good night.
- "They will die..."
- "The passion of those,"
"Love, in essence, they say,"
"They just go on chanting their name,"
"They will die, get ruined for them,"
"They will willingly get defamed
for them."
Sifra.
Are you still awake?
Oops...
Sifra never sleeps.
Sifra doesn't sleep. Sifra doesn't eat.
Sifra doesn't drink.
- You're drunk.
- Hmm.
"I've just had a few drinks."
"I've not committed a crime."
I love you.
I love you too.
Come, sit with me.
Aryan?
Hmm?
I found a fast-charging software online.
Hmm.
Should I download it?
Go for it.
Do whatever you want, hmm?
Use as much GB as you want...
Sifra...
I don't want to stop you
from doing anything.
Go ahead and download it, I'll wait.
Okay.
Okay.
Download starts.
Start.
Seven percent.
So cute you are.
Eighteen percent.
Eighteen percent, very good.
I'm so sorry.
Thirty percent.
Seventy-three percent.
When will your download get completed?
Eighty-nine percent.
Ninety-nine percent.
Download complete.
Hi, I'm Sifra.
Hi, Sifra.
Oh no, Sifra, I slept in your room.
Mom will be really upset if
She finds me here.
I'll be back in a moment.
Who are you?
What?
Who are you?
Who are you?
You don't know me?
I don't know you.
Sifra, just wait here, alright?
Okay?
Okay.
You...
Just wait here.
Hey, Pappu!
They're taking forever.
Can you make me a cup of tea, please?
- Sure, Uncle.
- Hey...
Put less sugar in it, alright?
What?
She came to wish you good morning.
Good morning.
Come, Sifra, say good morning.
Good morning.
We're getting late.
Who is he?
He's our uncle and this is our room, okay?
Come. Please, please.
Sifra...
Sifra...
Sifra, hello, hi.
- This way. Come here.
- Hi.
Have a seat.
Very good.
Take a seat here for a few minutes.
Give me your hand, Sifra.
Give me your hand.
You look tense.
Everything's great.
No problem.
Sifra?
- Who is it?
- Hey! Sifra? Where are you going?
It's me. Mom.
Mom? Who's mom?
Come on,
We were supposed to go out shopping.
Get ready.
I'm not feeling well. You guys go ahead.
We won't take too long.
You should come with us.
I just want to rest for a bit.
Are you sure?
Okay.
Alright then, we'll manage.
Let Pappu know if you need anything.
Okay, bye.
Okay, bye.
So cute.
Please sit here Sifra. Hmm?
Please.
One phone call. One.
Thank you.
Hello, Aunty. Aunty, I need your help.
Sifra's entire memory got deleted
and she doesn't remember anything.
She doesn't even remember me.
What happened?
I think she accessed
an unsecured website and...
Sifra, just go from here.
She downloaded a virus-infected software
that wiped out her entire memory.
Without your permission?
No, I gave her permission,
but I was really drunk at the time.
Alright, no problem.
I'll send you her memory backup,
but it will take four hours.
Aunty, hold on.
Sifra! Sifra!
Hi, Aaru.
Hi, Sifra.
It's good to have you back.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Okay, you... you should get ready.
I'll go take a shower too.
And don't forget to lock the door, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Pappu?
- Yes, Brother?
My ball landed here. Did you see it?
Yeah, I heard something over there.
Go and check it out.
Okay.
Why is it so quiet here?
Everyone went out to shop for the wedding.
- I'm going out to buy vegetables.
- Okay.
Hi.
Sifra? Sister-in-law?
What's that light on your forehead?
I'm getting charged.
You are getting charged?
Are you some kind of machine or something?
Yes. I am a robot.
A robot?
You're joking, right?
I'm not joking.
I really am a robot.
Huh?
Can I come in?
Sure.
She really is a robot.
This is your first time seeing a robot,
right?
Yes.
Can I... touch you?
Sure.
Brother!
I was...
Brother, I know the truth.
I'll tell everyone.
Go ahead and tell them.
But she's just a robot.
Remember how you used to play
with my Xbox all day?
You think there's no difference
between Sifra and an Xbox?
The Xbox works with a press of a button,
and she works with voice commands.
Sifra, laugh.
Sifra, don't laugh. Stay quiet.
Sifra, cry.
Sifra, don't cry.
Don't listen to anything he says.
Sifra, don't listen to him.
Come here,
Let me show you what she can do.
You wanted to see
what she's capable of, right?
Come with me. Let's go.
Come on, keep walking.
No, Brother. Brother,
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- Sifra, come here.
- What? You want to see, right?
- Let me go.
I won't tell anyone.
I won't tell a soul.
Forgive me. Please forgive me.
Are you having fun?
- Brother, please lift me up.
- How's the view down there?
I'm really scared.
She's about to drop you.
Pull me up!
- She'll drop you if I command her to.
- Pull me up!
- Should I tell her to?
- No!
I made a big mistake, Brother.
I'm an idiot.
You're like an older brother to me.
Let me get married, kiddo.
Please forgive me!
This was just a preview,
you do anything stupid again,
and I'll show you what truly
she's capable of.
Got it?
Yes.
Please, please...
Please, please... lift me up.
- No, I think...
- Please, please...
Sifra, I think you should drop...
No! No!
- Lift him up.
- No! No!
Are you going to do this again?
No! No! No!
- Brother! Please pull me up!
- Lift him up.
I won't tell anyone anything.
Sorry, Sister.
Buzz off.
How did he find out that you are a robot?
He saw me getting charged.
I told you to lock the door.
How did he get into the room?
Through the window.
You didn't tell me to lock the window.
How about using common sense, huh?
Just leave.
Miss new age Robot
What?
I asked you to leave.
Hello, Aunty! How are you doing?
Sorry, the network here is really weak.
What the hell is happening?
Your mom invited me to your wedding!
Are you really going to marry Sifra?
Everything you said before was all a lie,
right?
Don't you dare lie to me!
Aaru, answer me.
Yes, Aunty.
I am really going to marry Sifra.
Are you crazy?
I feel so stupid.
How could I not see this coming?
Aryan, stop with this drama
and tell everyone it was just a test.
Or else, I will tell them.
Then go ahead and tell them!
I'll also tell them the truth
about how I met Sifra, why I met her,
and what you didn't tell me about her.
And don't forget what you told my mom.
"Don't worry, Sharmila.
Sifra is a really nice girl."
You can explain why you said that too.
I'm taking the next flight out.
You can do as you please.
Aunty...
I am going to marry her no matter what.
Are you crazy?
Did you see that? Did you?
Oh!
She's really very talented.
Great job, Sister-in-law.
I'm done.
I'm impressed. You danced so well,
Sister-in-law. So well. Awesome!
Wait, wait, now it's Sifra's turn.
Yes.
We want to see how
your American daughter-in-law dances.
Yes, Sister-in-law.
You should dance to the latest song.
She can do that later.
Sifra, I would really like it if you danced
to the beat of the drums.
Sister-in-law, please.
Sifra, you should dance to this song -
"My heart started beating fast."
"I started feeling scared."
Come on, dance to this song.
- Okay.
- No wait, what okay? Sit down.
There's no way you'll dance to this song.
Come on, Sister-in-law!
- Mom! Mom! Come quickly!
- What's wrong?
Grandpa isn't feeling well.
- What?!
- What?!
- What are you saying?
- Wait for me.
- We are taking him to the nearest hospital.
- What's wrong?
The rest of you should follow us
in the other car.
- Okay, okay.
- Be careful.
You go ahead, I'll round up everyone.
Sifra, take the wheel
and drive us to the nearest hospital
using the fastest route.
How can she drive?
She doesn't know the way around here.
Nearest hospital.
Dad, I'll go get a stretcher.
Yes, go quickly.
Check if there's a doctor
on duty upstairs.
Go and check.
Dad, just five more minutes.
Hurry up.
Check if there's any doctor upstairs.
St. Sebastian Veterinary Hospital.
Oh no, this is a veterinary hospital!
I told you to drive!
- Get in, Dad.
- Why did you ask her to drive?
Get her out of the driver's seat.
Sifra, I'll take the wheel.
Switch places with me.
Hurry up!
Get in, get in, get in quickly.
Take the front seat.
Drive.
Hurry up.
What happened?
Was told at the venue
that Grandpa is critical
Dad...
Wait here.
Hi, Doctor.
Doctor, how is he?
His blood pressure was quite low.
We're slowly getting it under control.
Not to worry.
But considering his age,
we'll keep him in the ICU for today
to monitor him, just to be safe.
Can we see him?
Okay, but only two people at a time.
And here's a prescription
for some medications, please get them.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, take care.
- Goldie.
- Yes.
Get these.
- Come with me.
- Dad, you go inside. Mom, go with him.
- If there's any update...
- Yes, I'll let you know.
It's time for you to sleep.
It's 11:30 PM.
Turn off all the reminders, Sifra.
Okay.
Okay.
You seem upset.
Not now, Sifra.
Not now.
Yeah?
Timtim is calling.
Look over there.
Aryan Agnihotri?
I'll be right back.
Wait here.
Hi.
Hi.
You're worried about your grandpa,
aren't you?
I know. I know you love me a lot.
Can I tell you something?
I can't even laugh, man.
The doctors don't know how to treat me.
Even my family doesn't know what to do.
You should give me some drink
and my blood pressure will stay stable.
I know.
You came running
from your wedding rituals.
I'll attend your wedding.
I promise.
And I'll dance a lot. At your wedding.
It's my dear grandson's wedding after all.
I'll dance with all my heart.
Love you, son. Love you.
Go to sleep.
Look who's back!
Dad!
- Dad!
- Finally!
My Dad is back!
- You had me so worried.
- Aaru...
I haven't eaten anything for two days.
- Don't lie. That's impossible.
- Come on, Brother.
- You've lost weight.
- See!
Hi, Sifra.
Hi, Monty.
Grandpa is back from the hospital.
Okay.
Thanks for coming to
the engagement ceremony.
Very sweet of you.
Hey bro, you know that there was tension
in my house.
What happened?
Did you leave the wet towel
on the bed again and got in trouble?
Oh, I see, this is how you're going
to play it, huh?
Let me tell you something.
It's actually you who's going
to get in trouble.
Really?
You know what just happened?
What happened?
I was walking to the loo and I saw
Sifra is brushing her hair in her room.
I told her that Grandpa was back
from the hospital.
You know what she did?
She did nothing! She just kept brushing
her hair and said, "Okay."
Do you get my point?
You just don't understand.
Bro, she doesn't have any emotions.
Why are you always against her?
What's your issue with her?
She's like a little kid.
Come on, bro.
She's learning and trying
to understand everything bit by bit.
She's not a kid.
She's a freaking robot!
Well, she's at least better
than your wife.
Point.
Isn't she too tall though?
Yeah, she is. So?
I can't believe that
as a robotics engineer,
you don't see that this is the future.
Bro, I don't get
why you're not understanding this.
They'll get married
and have little-little metal kids...

Aaru won't be able to take
his eyes off her.
Sister-in-law,
You look absolutely stunning.
Let's go see if Aaru is all set.
Aryan!
Aunty! When did you arrive?
Just stop right there.
What the hell do you think you are doing?!
I thought we had a deal.
This was supposed to be only
an experiment.
But you...
You lied to me and your entire family.
Just get one thing clear, Aryan.
Sifra doesn't belong to you.
She is the result of years of hard work
from my team and me.
You have zero contribution
in creating her.
My company owns her.
Is that clear?
I'm taking Sifra back.
You're absolutely right, Aunty.
I have no ownership over Sifra.
But I do have a say in your life, don't I?
Can I talk to you for a couple of minutes,
please?
Just stop it, Aryan.
Just two minutes, Aunty. Please.
Please, Aunty.
Please have a seat.
Aunty, do you remember when I asked you
if there was anyone in your life
whose loss would make
your life incomplete?
You didn't have an answer then.
But I do.
It's Sifra.
Aunty, to you, Sifra is just a robot.
You can create thousands more like her.
But for me, she is everything, Aunty.
It doesn't matter to me if...
She is a robot or a human.
When she's with me...
I feel complete.
She's just perfect the way she is.
And you made her, Aunty.
I promise I'll be her best admin ever,
Aunty.
Please, don't take her away from me.
They have such a spacious bathroom,
but their darn liquid soap dispensers
are useless!
Oh.
Aunty.
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
What a... what a pleasant surprise!
You're here too!
I... I was just in the washroom.
Liquid soap.
Okay, bye, I'll see you.
Sorry. Sorry about this.
Please, Aunty.
I'll go get ready now.
Sister-in-law, are you ready?
Yes, I'm-ready.
Huh? What did you say?
I said, yes-I'm-ready.
Why are you speaking like that?
My motherboard is malfunctioning.
I... need...
to... be...
repaired...
Make a call to E-Robotics' customer care.
Call... Call... Call...
Call... Call... Call...
Call... Call...
"I ate your tomato."
"Go ahead
and file a complaint with the police."
Aryan brother!
Aryan brother!
Aryan brother!
Aryan brother!
Something's not right with Sister-in-law!
She's talking in a really strange voice.
What happened?
What kind of voice is she using?
I can't speak in that kind of voice.
It's creepy.
Like a witch.
Timtim, keep this to yourself, okay?
Something like this?
Are you crazy?
- Hey!
- Where did you last see her?
Outside her room.
Let's go.
She is not here!
She was standing right here.
What do we do now?
What's going on, Aunty?
I'm getting very nervous.
Sifra's GPS tracker isn't working.
Then how will we locate her?
Till it doesn't connect,
we can't locate her.
What will I do if she causes
a big "issue"?
Aunty, what will I do if
she gets into a big "issue"?
Yeah?
Yes, I'm on my way.
Yes, Monty, I'm coming.
Okay, bye.
Aunty, I'm going to look for Sifra.
Please call me as soon
as the tracker starts working.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- I'm calling Richard.
- Thank you, Aunty.
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
Hello, Richard?
Listen, ma'am,
I get that tomatoes are expensive
these days, costing 70 rupees per kilo,
but that doesn't mean
you should leave your wedding
and come here to file a complaint
that someone ate your tomato.
According to the law, there is no minimum
amount required to report a theft.
Yeah...
That... is... why... you...
will... have... to...
take... down... my... complaint.
She's a nutcase, sir.
I'm not a nutcase.
Fine, we'll lodge your complaint.
So if you're missing other things like
carrots, cabbage, peas, or cottage cheese...
You can file a complaint
for everything at once.
- File her complaint.
- Yes, sir.
Please come with me, ma'am.
Follow this way, please.
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- Hi! Good good.
Hey...
Did you find her?
Did you find her?
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
- What are you doing here?
- So sorry, sir.
- It was an honest mistake, sir.
- You idiot!
Is this the time to come
and collect laundry?!
Do I look like a bloody laundry boy
to you?
Get out.
- They're beautiful, aren't they?
- Yeah, they're really beautiful.
- They look so nice.
- Hey, Timtim!
I sent you to bring Sifra. Where is she?
Give her a call on her mobile.
Let me ask if she is ready.
Aunty, Sifra doesn't have a mobile phone.
- Huh?
- Really?
Yeah, who uses mobile phones
these days, right?
You think this is funny, huh, son?
Who doesn't use mobile
phones nowadays, huh?
Plants, trees, insects,
animals, and robots.
Go and get Sifra.
You go and get Aryan.
Okay.
And you step forward.
What are you doing?
Sifra is tall, I'm just checking
the length of the garland.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Please come.
What's your name?
Sifra.
Sifra.
Full name?
Super Intelligent Female Robot Automation.
Are you from down south?
No.
I'm-from-America.
From where?
I'm-from-America.
Sir, this case is not
within our jurisdiction.
Just do it.
Okay.
Your phone number?
9-9-1-0-
8-8-8-8-
8-8-8-
6-0-1-0-1.
Is this your phone number
or a lottery ticket number?
Phone number.
What's the name of the accused?
Aryan Agnihotri.
Agnihotri.
His phone number?
9-9-1-0-
8-6-0-1-0-1.
And his address?
Aryan Agnihotri. Agnihotri Niwas...
Patel Nagar, New Delhi, 110008
Okay, got it.
Please sign here.
Right here. There you go.
Alright, we will take care of it.
You can leave now.
Did you find her?
What?
Did you find her?
Bro, I searched the entire place like
a hawk but couldn't find her anywhere.
Why are you yelling over the phone, %^%$?
Sorry.
I said I searched the entire place like
a hawk but couldn't find her anywhere.
Meet me over there.
- Okay.
- Hurry up.
Oh damn, bro, look at what Sifra
just posted using your account.
Sifra posted something?
That means she is fine.
Yeah, she's fine but are you okay?
Check it out for yourself.
Why the hell did she post this?
Bro, delete it now.
That's exactly what I'm doing, dude!
Bro, let's find her before
She does something crazy.
What else are we doing right now?
- Alright then, let's go.
- Let's get moving.
- Where are you going?
- It's this way, follow me.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Delete the photo before anyone sees it.
Oh yeah.
What's wrong with it?
Hold on.
Since it's my phone,
I'll have to enter the password, right?
Yeah, it's your phone.
So I'll have to delete it using
my own phone, right?
- It's my account after all.
- You are absolutely right. Point.
- It's deleted now, let's go.
- Okay.
Sir, that nutcase gave
the same phone number
for both herself and the accused.
Check it out.
Something shady is going on,
don't you think?
Yeah, I have a feeling too, sir.
Here's what we should do.
Give that number a call.
Alright, I'll dial the number... Yeah
Hello?
Is this Aryan Agnihotri?
Yeah, that's me.
Look, this is Inspector Gupta calling
from Murthal Police Station.
Murthal Police Station?
Police station?
Do you know a girl named Sifra?
Yeah, I know her.
Is she with you right now?
She came by earlier.
She actually filed a complaint against you,
saying you ate her tomato.
We are so sorry.
Actually, she is a mental patient.
I swear, I felt the same.
I'm very sorry.
When did she leave from there?
It's been about thirty minutes.
Listen...
Make sure she sees a good doctor.
I'll have you arrested if she comes back
to file another complaint.
We're not here to handle petty
complaints about vegetables.
Take care of her, alright?
Yes, sir. I'll take care of her.
What's going on?
Sifra went to Murthal Police Station
to file a complaint.
Just a second.
What complaint did she file?
Well, I joked with her when
We were in America.
- She's a robot, right?
- Yes.
So, whenever she eats,
The food ends up in a tray.
And when that tray came out,
There was a tomato in it.
I ended up eating it.
She got upset, so I jokingly told her to go
and file a complaint with the police.
Wow, that's a cool trick.
Yeah, it's very cool, man.
But she is doing it now.
- There they are!
- Why is she doing it now?
Where have you guys been?
What are you doing here?
I can't find Sifra.
The guests have started arriving already.
Where is Sifra?
Mom, Sifra is not in her room.
But Aryan is here...
What do you mean she's not in her room?
We've been looking for her too.
She must be around here somewhere.
- We'll search for her.
- She left? Where could she be...
- You should take care of the guests, please. Alright?
- Just relax.
- Dad, please.
- Let's go.
- There's nothing to worry about. Don't worry.
- What is he saying?
- He doesn't know where she is?
- He's right.
- We should take care of the guests.
- Sister...
- He will find Sifra.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
- How can this be possible?
Grandpa has been searching for Pappu.
You've been looking for the car.
Yes.
And the three of us have been searching
for Sifra.
So?
What if Sifra and Pappu...
Sorry.
You did the right thing.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Where are we going?
We're going to that police station,
what was it called?
- Murthal.
- Yeah.
Murthal Police Station.
She must be there, somewhere.
What else can we do?
Shit.
What?
A bank transfer of Rs. 400,000?
I had told Sifra to do it on the day
of our engagement ceremony,
but then Grandpa told us not to.
Shit.
She's doing all the tasks we initially
asked her to do and then told her not to.
Hold on a second.
You told her not to do it, so those tasks
went into the deleted folder, right?
Exactly.
Why is she executing them now?
She is totally malfunctioning.
She is dangerous.
Anything could happen to her. Hurry up.
She can do anything, man!
Listen, as soon as more people arrive,
start serving dinner.
I've been noticing you.
This is your fourth drink already.
How many more drinks
are you planning to gulp?
I just checked the cottage cheese
and realised there's not enough salt. So...
- So how did that lead you to drink?
- Where is your Daughter-in-law?
She went to the salon,
but she'll be back soon.
You are looking so beautiful!
From where did you get this saree?
Pammi,
Why is she wandering around like this?
Who?
Shipra.
Hello, Aryan?
Sifra, why are you out here all alone
that too on your wedding day
without a veil covering your head?
What will people think of the Agnihotri
family if they see you like this?
You should keep their reputation in mind.
"Next time, if she acts rude,
just give her two tight slaps."
Hey!
Mom, did you see that?
Sister...
- Did you see that?
- What happened?
Come with me.
Sifra! Sifra...
Switch yourself off.
That's an order.
Okay.
Your task is in the queue.
As... soon...
as... all... my...
pending... tasks... are... over...
I'll-switch-myself-off.
Are you okay, dear? What hap...
Sifra?
Is she upset about something or what?
"Ouch!"
"My heart is beating fast,"
"My heart is feeling scared."
"My heart is beating fast,"
"My heart is feeling scared."
"Oh my love, let go of my arm,"
"Don't break the raw flowers."
"Oh my love, let go of my arm,"
"Don't break the raw flowers."
"My heart's beating fast,"
"My heart... is feeling scared.."
I had told her to dance to this song
during the Sangeet Ceremony.
Why is she dancing to it now?
"Sifra, I think you should drop him."
Let go of my arm.
Aryan, let go of her.
No, Aunty.
Sifra, please come with me.
I am your admin.
Let... go...
of... me.
Last warning.
No! Aryan!
- Aryan!
- Aryan!
Somebody help me!
Aryan brother where are you?
Aryan brother!
Please...
I will never misbehave
with any girl ever again.
Not even my girlfriend.
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
Help!
- Aryan!
- Aryan!
Are you okay?
Oh no, my son!
Mummy! Mummy!
Aryan brother is fooling everyone...
She is a robot!
Help!
- What... What is she doing?
- Aaru?
- Help!
- Oh...
I wonder what grudge
she has against my son.
Save me!
Aryan...
- Save me!
- Kapil!
She has gone crazy.
Help him!
"Looks like you'll set Delhi
on fire today."
"Do you want me to set Delhi on fire?"
Sifra...
Sifra...
Sif...
Stop it!
Sifra...
Sifra...
Why are you doing this, my dear?
What's happening?
You have set everything on fire...
It's getting burnt
What are you doing?
I want to set Delhi on fire.
Move.
Dad!
What Happened?
'You know that feeling when you lock eyes
with someone special for the very first time?'
'You see her laughing,
and it just makes you smile so wide.'
'Then you finally get to touch
for the first time.'
'And you find yourself entangled
in her words.'
'And then one day, you start to feel
the heaviness of losing her.'
'It's the way most love stories unfold,
isn't it?'
'My love story had its unique twists,
but it had that same essence.'
'But like they always say,
it's never over till it's actually over.'
Let me introduce you to ADROS.
These revolutionary robots are going
to make our lives easier and better.
They are ready to revolutionise healthcare,
home care, and security.
But...
But it's up to us to use them responsibly.
Let me present
to you these fabulous robots.
And my first creation,
the eighth wonder of the world -
Sifra.
"Oh Beloved!"
"Oh Beloved!"
Hello.
Sifra version 2.0.
Bro, I hope seeing her
again hasn't reinstalled
the spyware of Robo love
in your heart's operating system.
I've got all my safety settings turned on
and my anti-spyware is active.
Oh.
Your control panel is
in the hands of your wife
but I still have full control over mine.
Got it?
She's all yours.
Excuse me?
Hi, I'm Jiah.
Hi. Aryan.
I just started working
at E-Robotics last week.
Alright. Cool.
And ever since then,
I haven't stopped hearing about you.
Can I ask you something, please?
Sure, shoot.
Well, you see,
I haven't had much luck in love.
In fact, I feel like the qualities
I want in a life partner
are more likely to be found in a robot.
No lying, no cheating, no stupid tantrums.
Sounds pretty ideal ..right?
Is that too crazy a thought to want
someone that isn't even human?
That's a great question.
But I'm just a robotics engineer,
you know.
- And not a relationship counselor.
- Yeah.
Right!
But I'm sure if you keep searching,
you'll find a human being
who can understand your feelings.
You know a real human being
with real feelings and all
As opposed to a robot
which is programming?
So the choice is really yours -
An imperfect human being
with real feelings,
or a perfect robot which is programming?
I think I'll pick a human.
Good choice.
But I might need a bit more convincing
that it's possible to find
all those qualities in a human.
Sure.
Here? Now?
No, but... over a cup of coffee?
Yeah, as far as it's black coffee.
Black coffee is my favourite.
Black coffee is my favourite.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
I guess I'll see you for a cup
of black coffee then.
I guess.
I guess.
Dude,
you're planning a coffee date here,
and Sifra is getting jealous over there.
Don't get too excited,
It's not love, it's just programming.
Bro, she's already been formatted
and you're not her admin anymore.
