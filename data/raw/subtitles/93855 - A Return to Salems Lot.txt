Aah!
They're killing him.
Purifying him.
You said this was supposed
to be a fertility ritual.
It is. He knocked up
the chief's favorite wife.
I didn't come here
to film a circumcision.
This has never been recorded before.
Zoom in.
Give me the fuckin' camera.
Don't be stupid.
Get your hand off that gun.
Try not to show any emotion.
It's their society, their rules.
Think how they'd feel about
our gas chamber in San Quentin.
You're a cold-blooded son of a bitch.
You're not even human.
[GUNSHOTS]
- Aah!
- Aah!
[GUNSHOTS]
I'm sorry to chase off
all of that bare titty.
What's the matter?
It took me weeks to
get near the tribe.
You screwed everything up.
You have a son in the states.
- Jeremy?
- What's happened?
A major emergency, I'm afraid.
- Is he...
- We don't know,
but your wife is
sending frantic telegrams.
My ex-wife.
I didn't know you had a son.
How come you never said
anything about him?
Can't this damn thing fo any faster?
I hope he's nothing like you.
You got something in your eye.
- What?
- Here.
- Ow!
- Watch the camera.
Ow!
Of course I'm coming back.
Nothing's more important.
What?
Sally, thank you
for letting me know.
Well, well, well.
The son of a bitch
is half human after all.
Joe, I'd like you
to meet my husband Allen.
Yeah, sure. Hello.
How's Jeremy?
Is he conscious?
What's the matter?
I'm afraid Sally
exaggerated the situation.
I had to get you back up here, Joe.
How could you pull
this kind of stunt on me?
We tried,
but we can't get through to him.
The boy's deeply disturbed, Joe.
It's either you or commitment
to a psychiatric hospital.
- Your choice.
- Sure.
Dump him in a mental ward.
- It's a very fine hospital.
- Who dumped who?
You haven't even seen
Jeremy in three years.
Where the hell is he?
You're the big father
figure around here.
You can't even recognize him.
Go ahead. Find him.
There he is.
The kid in designer clothes, right?
Only you would put him
in an outfit like that.
How you doing, son?
Didn't they just tell you?
I'm fucked up.
So now what?
Give me five minutes
to adjust to civilization, OK?
I got a job offer in Peru.
Want to go to Peru?
Does it matter what I want?
Then there's Maine.
The Boondock.
The town's so small
it's not on most maps.
Sounds hot.
You want a cab?
Maybe you don't, but I do.
Bring the rest of them.
This aunt of mine,
did I ever mention her?
I don't remember you
mentioning anything.
She left me this Bungalow.
It can't be worth anything.
When your mother
was marrying that accountant,
- what's his name?
- Frank.
Right, Frank.
She left it to me as part
of the divorce settlement.
It's got to be a dump.
By the time we pay that cab fare,
we could buy a car.
I knew you were going
to stop at this car.
She is a beauty.
How much?
What it says, 1,500.
That's the blue book.
For this pile of shit?
I like this kid.
The boss,
next week he's going to
lower this price to 1,200.
I can give you a break.
That's the best I can do.
This thing's going to need
a couple hundred bucks
worth of tires soon.
You're very mechanically minded.
You're a very smart kid.
Take it for 1,000.
Exhaust system corroded to hell.
I noticed that.
I meant to write that down.
Thank you.
- 800, please?
- What do you say, boss?
I don't care.
After I drive it, we'll negotiate.
Negotiate?
We already negotiated.
Before I drive it, he negotiates.
After I drive, I negotiate.
See how it runs.
Please run.
Anyway, it's called Salem's Lot.
It used to be called
Jerusalem's Lot,
but the natives,
they shortened it.
Jeremy, I want you to
put that cigarette out.
Don't do that.
Fuck you!
You're not my father anymore
than the other three or four clowns.
I like some of them better than you.
I can take the criticism,
but leave out the "fuck you," OK?
Shit!
How I hate being a fuckin' kid.
I just wish
I was grown up already.
Are you good for anything
but swearing and smoking?
- You know how to drive?
- Sure.
That's one thing I did,
stole Allen's mercedes.
I spent some time here
with Aunt Clara at Salem's Lot.
Wasn't long, just a couple days.
I'll never forget it.
There was this girl.
She was older than I was.
She was 17.
My Aunt Clara, she sensed
something was happening,
So she put me on the train back.
She's not really my aunt.
She's a friend of the family.
She was nice.
I'll bet you that's why
she gave me this house,
to make up to me for all that.
Maybe she had nobody else
to leave it to.
That's possible.
Well, you got us here.
10 gallons unleaded.
We're all out of unleaded.
Any sodas? Any coke?
All out of that, too.
That figures.
Aren't there kids around here?
The old school look in good shape.
The historical society keeps that up.
We like to keep things
just the way they were.
Say, friend,
the old Hooper house,
is that on the hill?
Behind the school on the overlook?
Yes? No? Maybe?
See you around, neighbor.
- Around what?
- Yeah, around.
You and I could have long discussions.
We'll have heated debates
deep into the night.
Nice talking with you.
He's brought us his boy.
All grown up now.
Brought his boy.
A man now.
Our Joseph.
This house is over 100 years old,
still standing.
- Barely.
- Watch your step.
Look at those nice house down there.
Why couldn't we get one?
This will be nive when we fix it.
I'm not going in there.
Kid's right. It's a dump.
What did I get us into?
Thanks a lot, Aunt Clara.
Dad! Dad!
Can you use your hands?
Carpentry, painting,
stuff like that?
Shit. I knew it.
Slave labor.
Shit. Assholes.
Don't tell them that to their face.
What have we done now?
What have you done?
You folks got business
around here?
What do you care?
Jeremy, I'll do the talking.
Go check out the school.
- You mean get lost.
- Right.
This is my house, sir.
It was deeded to me.
You got proof?
Sure.
Got it here somewhere.
There you go, Sheriff.
Constable.
Constable Rains.
Not planning to sleep there,
are you?
How about my deed?
I'll show this to the judge.
You got a judge here?
Isn't this a small town?
Get this document back
from Judge Axel personally.
That's the big white house
on main street.
He's here. Jeremy's here.
He's going to stay.
He's belong to us.
[THUMP]
What are you doing here, boy?
- Baa!
- Baa!
This town sucks.
5R30.
Correction, 5R34, 10-02.
[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]
Turn off the ignition.
Get out.
Give me the keys.
What did we do?
Come on. Let's go.
We didn't do anything.
Come on, man.
Let's go. Let's go.
You kids ought to know better
than to be speeding around
Jerusalem's Lot at night.
You mean Salem's Lot.
[IN CREPPY VOICE]
Don't ever go to Salem's Lot.
An evil place.
Shut up, Sherry.
You're making it worse.
- Shut up.
- Are you making fun of our town?
I said, are you
making fun of our town?
Just let us get out of here.
We can't let you go.
Tonight's a holiday.
We're celebrating.
Looks like a fuckin' party.
We got to teach them some respect.
Get away.
What are you doing?
Get away from us.
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No! No!
Stop!
Your only chance
is to make it to the church.
They can't follow you
in there, understand?
Go to that cottage on the hill.
They'll help. You understand?
Get off me!
Let me go.
Lady, tell them to stop.
No! No!
Aah!
Help me.
Isn't there anybody here
to help me?
God.
God, please, God.
Please don't let them kill me.
Please make them go away.
She'll go to Clara's cottage.
Yep. Just like Judge Axel
wants her to do.
Wipe your mouth.
Hey!
Hey!
Goddamn it!
That's my Jack Daniel's.
Yours? It's half mine,
you dumb son of a--
Girls. Come here, girls.
Come here.
What are you doing out so late?
Why are you giggling?
What's so funny?
The cut of our duds?
Oh, look.
Hey, look at that.
What are you laughing at?
What's so funny?
Hey, Louie,
I think they're retarded.
They're not retarded.
They're disturbed.
Disturbed?
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
Get back, kids.
Get out of here.
They get any closer,
I' m smacking them.
Yeah, hit a kid, go to jail.
Aah! Aah!
What is that?
This town is weird.
Where'd I put that lantern?
Scared me, too.
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
What is it?
What happened?
Oh, God!
You're not going to believe me!
You'd be surprised what I'd believe.
Here, sit down here.
Jeremy, get her a glass of water.
They grabbed them,
and they killed them.
There was blood.
Shit. She is majorly stoned.
They're dead.
I know,
but something happened to her.
Go get some hot water and towels.
Now, Jeremy!
Now, tell me what happened.
They killed him!
They pulled him out
of the car and killed him.
- Who?
- The whole town!
You think I'm crazy, but it's true.
That's Judge Axel's house
at the end of main.
He'll listen to you.
Jeremy, knock on the door.
Oh.
Now, take it easy.
Tell your story to the judge.
Sorry to disturb you,
but it's an emergency.
I'm Joe Weber, Clara's nephew.
Something's come up
regarding your constable.
No bother.
You're always welcome.
Come on in.
And the curiously dressed
young woman, you step in, too.
Martha's in the kitchen
taking care of the dessert.
This is our town physician,
Dr. Fenton, Mrs. Fenton,
and their lovely
granddaughter Amanda.
My, my, my.
Oh, my poor child.
Goodness.
She's trembling like a leaf.
I think she has a fever, I do.
Come here. Sit down.
Let's have a look at you.
From the look in the eyes,
I'd say she's been partaking
illegal substances,
and not too long ago.
But she claims she was attacked
by your local constable.
That degenerate, Rains?
Wouldn't be the first time.
Axel, the children.
We shouldn't talk about sordid--
Pardon me. Amanda, dear,
take the lad to town hall.
Maybe he's never seen a wedding.
Of course, Grandfather.
I'd love to.
What wedding?
It's a small family gathering.
I'm certain the boy
would be very welcome.
He's a dear boy.
It'll be all right, Dad.
I'll be fine.
[SHERRY] No!
Don't let them go out there alone!
Young lady,
you must compose yourself.
Try to start making sense.
You're silly.
I'm so sorry.
I do feel safe here.
I guess I was dreaming part of it.
I remember, we were in the car.
I told them to stay off
the road to Salem's Lot.
- They wouldn't listen!
- Your favorite.
It's her!
She's one of them!
Sherry, just calm down.
Easy, Sherry.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
- Leave her alone!
- She's ours now.
There's nothing more
you can do for her, Joe.
- [SHERRY] Aah!
- They're killing her, aren't they?
Something like that.
You recognized your aunt.
- Clara.
- One of us.
One of what?
You still haven't figured it out,
have you, Joe?
Mr. Professional Anthropologist.
You have run across
the oldest race in humanity,
nestled here quietly
amid the folks,
protected by a skepticism
that says they don't exist.
Vampires.
Speak it again, Joe.
Vampires!
It's easier if you speak it.
What have you done with Jeremy?
Aah! Aah!
Since when do vampires need guns?
Just for show.
[CLICK]
This gun probably hasn't
been fired in over 100 years.
Contemporary people
seem to understand guns
more than anything else.
I understand a girl's been murdered.
Let's go look for your son.
You've seen more than most people.
You've traveled through a world
of starvation, war,
and killing for profit.
Do you think that that world
is any better than ours?
You son of a bitch.
If you didn't have my son,
I'd kick your fuckin's ass
around this town
until you couldn't suck orange juice.
Jeremy!
We're all dairy farmers
in these parts.
You outsiders grow stock for meat.
We grow them for blood.
See, human blood is still the best,
but nowadays it's not
quite good for you,
what with drugs, alcohol,
and this AIDs virus.
Then why go after people?
Oh, tonight's a wedding.
It's like a holiday.
We celebrate in tribute to past ways.
When blood was good and pure.
Course, Jersey cows give
thicker, richer milk.
And richer blood, too.
I've seen enough cows.
I want to see my son.
In good time.
Don't be scared.
Who's scared?
Come, join us.
What a shame,
all that going to waste.
You clean up pretty quickly
after a killing, don't you?
See the missis there chopping garlic?
That should dispel one
of the myths about us...
and garlic.
Looky here...
This mirror.
My reflection is clear as yours.
It sounds to me like
you want me to write all this down.
Yes, sir, young man,
a true chronicle.
For who to read?
Oh, we don't expect this
to go public for 200 years.
But write by someone
with all the proper qaulifications,
a somebody in his own time,
my boy...
I'm the same person you loved
when you were a little boy.
Were you one of them even then?
You took comfort in my arms
all the same.
Yes, I did.
It was the happiest time
of my childhood.
You could write something
real important.
You could change the way
outsiders feel about us forever.
- A history?
- A bible.
See, you have what
they call credibility.
It's your profession to set down
the ways of odd cultures.
You go on murdering passers-by,
and I'm an accomplice?
Yes, that's... that's odd.
I've been explaining to you
that our appetite doesn't
extend to human prey...
excepting now and again.
Axel, can't you see
his mind is on the youngster?
He's worried sick about the boy.
Well, then, we'll just have
to set his mind to rest.
[SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER]
[JEREMY]
Don't you guys ever sleep here?
I mean, don't you even get tired?
No. I get enough sleep.
There, you see, Joseph?
There's your Jeremy
running happily with
his newfound friends.
Dad! Dad!
Just as safe as at home...
And just as happy
as you were as a boy.
I'll get you!
Ah!
I have someone who will
put your fears to rest,
someone who's been waiting
for your arrival, waiting patient.
[GIRL] Joey.
I've been waiting for you,
my Joey.
I'd be happy if you could
just be Joey again for me.
I think he's very cute.
Now, don't start that again.
Stop it.
He belongs to Cathy.
I stayed the same, Joey.
I waited for you,
and I wanted to stay
just as you remembered me.
I was 17, Joey.
You were only 14,
too young,
but I love you, Joey.
So I waited.
I knew you'd come back to me.
He's been ours since
he was born, you know.
I don't trust him.
He'll betray us.
I won't take his soul.
He must give it willingly.
You just want to find out
if any human can love us.
If he loves us,
he'll be my successor.
If not,
I'll send his soul straight to Hell.
- Good day, dear.
- Good day.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Walk slowly. Just act calm.
I am calm.
Get in the car.
If we keep going
to the end of the road,
we'll be on the highway.
- Why run?
- These people aren't human.
They won't kill us.
They could have done that already.
If they don't kill us,
what else is there?
Is that girl getting into your head?
Dad, let's finish the house
like you promised.
You shut up.
Where were you all right?
You sure weren't looking for me.
Keep quiet!
What's wrong with you?
You want me to drive?
No.
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
[JOE]
They give you something to take?
No, I'm not on anything.
They're against drugs.
I've been taken into a closed society,
offered the secrets
of what may be the oldest
and most despised race on Earth,
and I've found them here,
not in some distant
slavic mountain country,
but as Americans.
I know they have killed for centuries,
and I'm certain
my life and my son's life
doesn't mean a thing to them,
but they want a bible.
Ow! Ooh!
Shit.
So what's on your mind?
Not what you think.
Jeremy, have you, uh...
Did you get laid last night?
Who me?
I'm just a kid.
Did you?
You don't sleep.
You have this energy suddenly.
You can't wait till dark, can you?
They're all right.
At least they don't turn into bats.
I've come across lots of vampire bats
up along the Orinoco River.
Them I could kill. I don't like
things that suck your blood
and have conversations
afterwards.
Don't stay on my account.
I'll be in good hands.
Oh, please, get to work.
I want you to come
to school tonight.
They asked me to bring you along.
Oh. Open school night, huh?
Bring your tape recorder, too.
What are you now,
my research assistant?
You wanted us to go things together.
Well, here's our chance.
[SLURP]
[SLURP]
[SLURP]
It's our feeding time, Joseph.
These cows can replace
this blood in a week,
and we can feed again.
[SLURP]
Jeremy, go on to the school.
I'll catch up with you.
More kindly than butchering them,
the way you outsiders do.
Although I must confess
I prefer human blood.
Axel says I have a drinking problem.
- Who's this?
- I'll find out.
Can I help you?
Aah...
I thought you needed help.
That's why I stopped.
Where are you going?
It depends where the hell I am now.
You're in Salem's Lot.
Well, maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
Kesserling is his name.
You recognize him?
No.
How about looking at the picture?
Still no.
Your headlight's out.
I know it. You know it.
The car doesn't know it.
He speaks dutch.
Do you know this face,
young fellow?
Dutch. Hmm?
I wouldn't know
how a dutch accent sounds.
Let's go, Dad.
Is something up at this hour here?
They usually roll up the sidewalks
at 10:00pm in these towns.
It's a special occasion.
Do you need directions?
No, no, thanks a lot.
You're very kind.
Be careful.
I go by instincts.
I'm a hell of a lousy driver.
I'm going to get killed
like this someday.
Be careful.
You're lucky.
You don't know how lucky.
See what happanes
when you get old?
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America
and to the republic for which it
stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.
We have some visitors
who are new to our town,
so, shall we review
the year and circumstance
that brought us to this land?
It was 1620.
Not the Mayflower,
the other ship
which everybody thought had sunk.
No shouting. Yes, Amanda.
The ship was the Speedwell.
We thought it best others
believe we perished at sea.
We knew what to expect
from those pilgrims.
Puritans, they called themselves.
Hypocrites, I call them.
So we lit out on our own.
We came here in secret.
Far from witch-trials
and persecutions,
far from crazy mobs driving
stakes through our hearts.
300 years of this?
So you see vampires are forever.
Do you have a question, Jeremy?
I don't get this.
Who are those people
hanging out during the day
running the shops and the stores?
- Drones.
- Shh.
Where do they come from?
We breed them for service,
like we breed cattle for blood.
I don't like them.
They don't like being called Drones.
Again, it's that derogatory word
that we do not encourage
in the classroom.
Uh, turn to your page 135
in the text,
the spanish inguisition--
the brutality of man...
I guess they have
no sex education here.
Let's go.
Thousands of people were killed...
Come on, Jeremy.
People perished for their beliefs.
Spanish inguisition--
ecclesiastical tribunal...
I can't wait.
I don't want to go.
I want to hear the rest.
It's not good for you.
Let Jeremy stay.
There's a lot to learn.
It's bullshit.
It's antihuman propaganda.
The boy has a mind like yours,
inquisitive and skeptical.
- Please, Dad?
I have a carriage outside.
You and I can ride to Miller's pond.
Do you promise me
you won't go back in that classroom
and that you'll go home right now?
OK, I promise.
Jeremy?
If you're still out there,
why don't you come back in?
We'd love to have you.
It's not far, Joey.
Remember how we came here
when you were a little boy?
Always at night like this.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Jeremy, what is happening to you?
- You know.
- Know what?
Don't play games with me.
OK. I've decided.
You can't spend your life
in a child's boy.
No, a man.
To outsiders,
I'll be trusted like a child,
but I'll be as cunning as a man.
I'll serve better in
the image of a child.
Serve? Be a slave, you mean.
Slave? Who's the slave?
I didn't see you run away
the first night.
You're the one
who wants to write their bible.
I'm an ambitious asshole.
You said so yourself.
We're both caught.
[MOOING]
Dad, I can't sleep.
The sunlight hurts my eyes.
You want an aspirin?
I have to do it.
The pain won't go away
until I do it.
I know.
I know.
Amanda, no. No, not yet.
Here, Jeremy.
I hope it gets dark soon.
It will.
It's going to be all right.
It will be all right.
Stop! Stop! Go back!
Let us go.
Why don't you let us go?
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Uh!
Oh!
Ah!
Ya!
[JEREMY]
Leave me alone!
Dad! Help me!
You're not hurt that badly.
- Just a few bumps and bruises.
- Uh.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Let him alone.
Well, Joe.
You've gone and kill Abner Pepper.
You took that poor drone's life
during his 29th year.
Please,
don't take it out on Jeremy.
It was all my idea to run.
It appears, Joseph.
That young Jeremy
is about to have
a little brother or sister
to keep him company.
Is that so, Catherine?
Yes, Mrs. Axel, our child.
He'll grow up to love
and serve us all his life.
He'll protect our graves.
No, that can't happen.
You'll love our baby.
I know you will.
You bastard.
You worked this out
to bind me to you by blood.
Jeremy's down at
the schoolhouse taking his vows.
Soon he'll be reborn.
Dead!
What he'll be is dead!
Why do you make it sound
so all-fired awful?
It's no worse than having
his tonsils out.
You took a boy from us,
and now you're giving us a boy back.
You bitch.
You sons of bitches.
Give me my son now.
You promised you'd take
no human blood.
If you take my son's blood,
I'll kill you.
You'll have to kill me,
I swear to God.
Joe, you've set yourself
a good bargaining position.
I'm hardly interested...
Mind you, this little ritual
can be completed
if you don't hold up
your end to the letter.
Don't worry, I'll keep
my side of the bargain.
I'll write your bible.
So be it.
I think that young Jeremy
should be living
separately from you for a spell.
- Where?
- Well, never mind.
He'll be under
my personal protection.
"Discomfortable cousin,
knowest thou not
"that when the searching
eye of heaven
"lights up the sphere
that lights the lower world,
that thieves and murderers
range abroad unseen?"
Research material.
Be careful of the pages.
They crumble very easily.
Get busy.
Where did all this money come from?
We're very wealthy people, Joseph.
Can you imagine how rich you'd
be if you'd get to live 300 years?
Just real estate alone.
We own land on the Boston common.
We have property all the way up
through Maine and New Hampshire.
Why, vampire life and
financial security go together.
And not a penny
from the government.
I'd like to talk with you.
I got nothin' to say.
I've been asked to write
a bible about your people.
Why didn't you leave
when you could?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Or you're half one of them.
Axel's my grandfather,
but I'm dirt to him.
I'm just someone to
protect him when he sleeps.
Then why don't you run off?
To where? To your world?
There's nothing there for me.
Axel, aside from being what he us,
doesn't seem all that bad.
Axel lets you see
what he wants you to.
I saw him once when he was
angered, when he lost control.
I saw his true face.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Give me my son back!
Clarence!
Clarence!
Clarence,
you must have seen Jeremy.
Where do they keep him
during the day?
That's not for you to trouble about.
But I'm doing what I'm told.
I'm writing till
my hand is paralyzed.
Why can't I see him?
And you don't have
any feelings about this.
Are you a human being?
Do you have any thoughts,
any feelings?
You should be nice to me
because your baby will
grow up to be just like me.
It's OK to hit us drones.
That's what we're here for.
Ooh, tourists.
I hate tourists.
My friend Kesserling
said he came through here
and bought your best Hepplewhite.
Don't tell me Carl here
isn't a customer of yours,
a regular customer.
Yep, I'm telling you that.
You know, always the best
merchandise is kept in the cellars.
Can I take a peek?
We're closing.
- You want me to leave?
- Yes.
All right.
I'd give my right ball
to have such working hours.
Uh, mister, you still not lost?
Oh, I remember you.
Don't tell me this is the same town.
What's it called?
Jerusalem's Lot.
Mm-hmm.
You said Salem's Lot.
Same place.
Well, I got lost.
You know that ridiculous
feeling of being helpless?
Are you still flashing that
picture on everybody?
Would like to take another look at it?
Say, see that police car?
Couple times it circled around here.
Keeps looking at me.
He likes to give out tickets,
so I'd run along if I were you.
Well-- oh! My glasses.
Wait a minute.
I can't drive without glasses.
Hey! Open up!
You got my damn glasses!
It's getting late.
You can stay at my place.
- It wouldn't be an imposition?
- Not at all.
Do you want me to drive?
It's a necessity, I believe.
Go away.
I'm going to turn in, Mr. Van Meer.
If you need anything,
you just holler, all right?
OK, Joe, good night.
I'll be up soon.
You.
What do you want, Sonny?
Listen, I have to tell you.
Well, so tell me.
That guy that you're looking for?
Yes?
There's a school teacher at
my school who looks like him.
You sure?
You're really sure, now?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
OK.
Take a good look.
Take a good look.
Is that the man?
That's him, but with less hair.
That's good.
You're on the ball.
Very good.
Well, he's still down at the school.
At this hour?
What the hell's he doing at school?
He sleeps in the school building.
Why did they let you go?
What's going on here?
What's wrong?
You keep out of this.
Jeremy, you're trying to
lure him there to get killed.
Don't worry about me.
I don't die easily.
Glasses or no glasses,
you should get out of here.
You seem nice, Joe.
Why the hell
would you protect a nazi?
A what?
- A nazi.
- A nazi?
Admit it, that's Kesserling.
- A nazi?
- Yeah.
- In Salem's Lot?
- Yep.
You know, even a nazi
would have enough sense
not to hang around Salem's Lot.
Then what the hell
is all this secrecy about?
What the hell's going on in this town?
Shut up!
Just shut the fuck up!
And you, you go away!
What a rude boy,
talking to his father like that,
and in front of company!
- He's not himself, mister.
- You--
Can you read this
without your glasses?
Yeah.
Yeah, my vision is improving.
I figured it would.
Ah.
Look at me!
Try this.
It gets their attention.
Wash his mouth out with soap.
Now you sit down.
Say uncle! Say uncle!
Uncle!
OK, now you stay put!
Hear me?
Goddamn kids.
Hate these little puppies,
coming around when
I'm trying to concentrate.
Joe...
You trying to give me nightmares?
Keep reading.
Uh!
Where did you grab him?
- Right there?
- Ah! Ow!
Hey, that works.
Now are you going to sit down?
OK. Just leave me alone.
Well, what do you think?
Nobody believes in vampires.
Don't believe any of it!
He hates everybody in town
because they're my friends.
He doesn't want anyone to like me.
You know, the pages
I doubted at first,
but you convinced me.
We've got a great opportunity
here, my boy.
Make a right turn
onto the main road.
Don't stop till we hit Bangor.
I said a right turn.
You're going back.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm a dutch jew,
but my moyher was romanian.
Half my childhood I spent
in the carpathian mountains,
where all the tales passed,
along with the remedies.
A church in Salem's Lot?
A museum.
They keep it there for appearances.
Doesn't make any difference.
If nobody desanctified it,
it's a sanctuary.
We'll barricade ourselves in.
After sunup, we'll get them
while they're asleep in the coffins.
Jeremy, you know where
those coffins are hidden.
He won't help you.
We'll see if he's more
scared of them or me.
There's those hybrids to deal with.
I've dealt with son of a bitches
that made a deal with the devil.
I took this off an SS Colonel
in Argentina, '52.
- You arrest them?
- I shoot them.
That cuts through the red tape.
I'm not a nazi hunter.
I'm a nazi killer.
I told you I was a lousy driver.
He got up.
Arrrgh.
This could cost me
a whole New Windshield.
[SNARLING]
Shit, they're ugly.
Not tidy...
But the alter has
not been desanctified.
All those legends are not bullshit.
We'll be safe here.
We got a lot of work to do.
[SIREN]
What's that?
Oh, no.
It's the short-line bus.
They diverted it to the center of town.
Hi, folks. Don't be alarmed.
Welcome to Salem's Lot.
I'm Judge Axel,
and there's been an accident.
Unfortunately,
I'm going to have to
ask you people to leave the bus
and answer a few questions,
names, addresses, and all that,
and you may leave your
personal belongings in the bus
because you'll be right back.
I should have taken the train.
Shit,
stuck in a dead town like this.
You broke your solemn vow,
Joseph,
released me from my promise,
released us to seek
human blood again!
- Jeremy, don't look at this.
- No, let him look.
Let him look.
Ah!
Oh, oh!
Aah!
No!
Ah!
Aaah!
Oohhh!
Oh, oh!
They sleep in the basement
of their homes.
Not the children.
They sleep under the school.
Well, thank you.
My coffin's there, too.
What are you thinking right now?
The way those poor people
sounded when they were being killed.
What else?
I don't know. The smell,
the funny smell inside that coffin,
the dampness.
Disenchantment has set in.
Dad, I'm scared.
Jesus, I'm scared.
That's a good sign.
Here.
Shave that tip.
Judge Axel first, then the rest.
There's too many.
We can't kill the whole town.
I've seen bigger towns wiped out,
towns with nice, harmless
people, so I know it can be done.
[CRASH]
Mr. Van Meer, wake up.
We overslept.
We lost half the day.
How could we have slept so long?
Somebody must have put
the hex on us.
We shouldn't have looked
into the judge's eyes last night.
It's too late.
We don't have enough time now.
The hell we don't.
Wake the boy.
Let's move out.
Jeremy?
Jeremy, wake up.
Jeremy, we've got to go,
but I want you to stay here.
I can help.
You can help more by staying inside.
Make them believe we're still here.
We've only got the constable
and the deputy to take care of.
What about Cathy?
Who is Cathy?
She's, uh, one of them.
She's pregnant,
and it's my child.
No wonder you failed
to tell me about it, that girl.
Can you handle her?
You stay in this church.
Stay put. You're safe here.
Don't move out of here.
Careful,
don't spill that holy water.
Good, he thinks
we're afraid to come out.
Get back in there.
That's what he wants us
to believe he thinks.
What do you say, that way?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Aaah...
Grrrr!
Open the drapes.
This is your wake-up call, Judge.
Shit! We've been had!
10 to 1, we'll be had again!
Look at that goddamn thing.
Arrraa!
Ah!
Yech.
And I thought I'd seen everything.
Murderers!
You're going straight to Hell!
Aaah!
Ah, Joe!
Aaah!
What grabbed you?
Not a damn thing,
but it looked good.
[GUNSHOTS]
You hold it right there!
Ah! Ah!
Oh! Ooh!
Hmm.
Why couldn't I go?
I could have helped them.
Amanda, you can't be out
here in daylight. You'll die.
I won't die,
and neither will you.
If you come now,
we can live forever.
And he sleeps in a box.
That won't do any good.
Sure as hell won't do any harm.
Aaaa...
Mr. Van Meer?
I got another one, Joe.
Would you come here?
What's up?
I need your help.
Be right there.
What is it, Joe?
Mr. Van Meer, she's here.
I can't do this.
That's not a baby.
We've got work to do,
and don't you dare buckle right now.
I'll take care of this.
You're not going to get
Joe or his kid, you bitch.
Bitch. Damn it.
I know you're around here
some-damn-wheres.
Aah!
Joe!
What's the matter?
Too early to rise.
Can't come out.
Too early.
It's too soon!
Joe!
Aah!
Too early.
[GUNSHOTS]
Joe!
Joe!
Pull.
Aah.
On your right, Joe.
On your right!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Aah! Aah!
Judge! Judge!
You're early, Sarah.
Close the lid before I burn.
Rains is dead. Deputy, too.
They're going house to house now,
killing as they go,
killing off all of your followers.
Then I'll have to make
more followers, won't I?
It's time we brought in
some fresh blood.
Now let me rest.
Jeremy.
I told that kid not to leave.
Jeremy, don't hide on me.
I told him to stay here.
Sons of bitches. They got him.
You're losing a lot of blood.
I've got more blood than I need.
Your boy told us his coffin
is in the schoolhouse basement.
They want us to come there.
It's getting dark,
and that's where they'll be.
We'll stop and get gas.
That's where they want us.
This should keep them
busy for a while.
Let's go! Let's go!
Joe, that window. No bars.
I couldn't let you leave Salem's Lot
without seeing this production
that our young people
have prepared.
Children.
Don't be alarmed,
and don't be frightened.
They won't attack you
unless I say so.
So I finally meet
the head man himself.
Are you in a lot of pain, Doctor?
It keeps me alert.
At my age, I have
a tendency to doze.
I'm four times your age,
and still going strong.
Must be doing something right.
I presume you were dead once,
so you'll know.
What's over there?
An indescribable sweetness.
God?
He forgives us.
Who is he-- God?
Different from us as
we are different from you.
Let me take away your pain,
Doctor, and give you eternal life.
I've lived my life.
All right, gentlemen,
it's showtime!
Jeremy, listen to me.
Dad.
Get up. Get up now!
Dad!
Jeremy,
they have no power over you.
You're free, and they're dead.
No! Dad!
You are not dead!
Jeremy! Jeremy, please!
Now for the traditional scene
that you gentlemen tried to
perform on some of the townfolk--
the stake in the heart.
Stand up!
I've seen my kinsmen die this way.
I've seen their bodies
consigned to hell fire.
No!
Aah!
You'll never make a bloodsucker
out of me, you bastard.
The human took his own life.
Do you see that smoke?
Do you know what's happening?
The coffins are burning.
Your homes are burning.
There's no place to hide.
When the sun comes up,
you'll fry.
The sun will burn you
right to your souls.
Every last fucking one of you,
you're going to fry.
Dad, help me!
Jeremy, get up!
Get up and run!
I'm not dead!
Get to the cellar.
Save the coffins.
Let Cathy have them.
Aah!
Our baby!
Aah!
Our baby!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Get out of here.
No.
Aah!
The coffins!
Oh!
Help put out the fire!
Aah! Aah!
[COUGHING]
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
You!
You've murdered all of us!
Isn't that why
you brought me back here?
To bring you peace?
No!
Clara, pray.
Aah!
I think we'll be safe here.
We'll stay here
until the sun comes up.
They'll either be dead
or back in their coffins.
Amanda, too?
Yes, Amanda, too.
You've angered me, Joseph,
made me lose control,
made me show my true face.
Now it's time I took your souls.
You're mine now.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
[HORN HONKS]
[HORN HONKS]
[HORN HONKS]
[HORN HONKS]
Who the hell is in that bus?
Get on.
You've got more fucking
lives than a vampire.
Suicide's for nazi SOBs.
Should have been an actor.
Shoot a gun, fall down,
that's it.
I'd have been here
before, but damn ankle.
I don't know how
I got this tank moving.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
We'll find the state police
and tell them.
Who'll believe vampires?
In 500 years,
who'll believe there were nazis?
We couldn't have gotten them all.
I think they'll choose
to die together,
than wait for us to
come back with help.
I think we'll find nothing.
All of the sudden I'm not
in such a rush to grow up.
Me neither.
I guess getting old
isn't so bad either.
Joe, I think he's becoming
a human being.
Don't let his mother find out.
[HORN HONKS]
