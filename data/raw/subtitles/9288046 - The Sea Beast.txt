"There was a time
when children dreaded the night,
for the sleeping hours
brought visions of horror."
"The dark times
when those terrible sea beasts
would ravage our shores,
and no ship was safe on the sea."
"But thanks to the hunters,
those days are over."
"Today, these valiant warriors
battle the beasts far beyond the horizon,
risking their lives to rid the seas
of those nightmare creatures."
"And the greatest of the hunting ships
is the Inevitable..."
"And the greatest of the hunters
is Captain Crow!"
- Yar!
- Captain Crow!
I'm Captain Crow. Smelly old beast!
Hey.
Who's reading this story?
Oh my word!
What's this?
Lights-out was an hour ago.
Oh, you'll be the death of me.
Come on. Along. Along you pop.
And, Miss Maisie,
the king and queen
care for you hunter orphans
out of their kindness.
When you disobey the house rules,
you disrespect them.
So we're not going to have
any more attempts now, are we?
Absolutely not.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Fair travels, me swabs.
And remember,
live a great life
and die a great death.
- Bye-bye, Maisie!
- We'll miss you!
See you tomorrow!
All hands on deck!
All together now!
Heave away!
Hold your tongues!
- Where'd you see it?
- Dead ahead, Jacob.
Huh.
Are you sure?
Aye, a red tail. Biggest I ever saw.
Just under the surface.
Then today is the day.
It's the Red Bluster.
I know it in me bones.
See there!
Birds follow it.
- We come all this way for a proper fight.
- And we'll get it, me boy.
It's been 30 years
since that thing took me deadlight.
Now I'll have me revenge.
Aye.
Well,
we've passed Rum Pepper Island.
It's heading for the Dregmorr Sea.
If we're gonna do battle
with the greatest
and most terrible thing in the sea,
it's best not to wait till after.
There might not be an after.
Haul away, all!
Haul, you dogs!
Captain!
It's another hunting ship under attack!
It's Jim Nicklebones' ship.
- It looks like he's found a brickleback.
- I'd say it found him.
We have to help him.
What course, Captain?
- We press on.
- What?
If Jim Nicklebones were
half the sea dog he says he is,
he wouldn't be in this mess.
Captain, you know the code.
It binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.
And even that rum gagger Jim Nicklebones.
Ms. Merino, set a new course.
Aye, Captain.
Strike the spanker!
Clew up for an' main.
Thirty years I've waited.
Thirty years!
Blast!
Rudder to midship.
Come around!
Don't worry. We'll be to the Bluster
in no time, Captain.
Drive her down, Mr. Crisp!
It's too much, Captain! We're going down!
This is it, mates!
It's been me honor to serve with ya.
Haul away!
By God, it's the Inevitable!
Have at it, Black Bird!
Let it know we're here!
We've joined.
We have weather gauge.
Shall we draw it upwind?
Aye, and cross the T.
Hard to port, Mr. Crisp!
I'll have her into the wind
as high as she'll bear, Ms. Merino!
Furl the main and fore,
and ease your headsails, swabbies.
Mainsail haul!
Here we go!
Heads up.
Aim low.
All right, ya fish killers!
We come all this way for a proper fight.
And now, we'll get it!
Nearly there, Captain.
Aye, Sarah.
Now, to port, Ms. Merino. And cross the T!
You heard him, ya lubbers!
Haul your mizzen! Main and fore!
Make it scream, piper!
Here we go!
Fire!
We've not discouraged our prey.
Quite the opposite, I'm afraid!
Not to worry, Jacob.
Clew up aloft, Ms. Merino.
Haul away
your main and mizzen!
Topsail, clew lines!
- Haul away!
- Loose!
It's diving!
Get under the companionway
and don't come out till it's settled.
Clever fish.
It's gone upwind.
Stand to. Wait for the word!
You heard the captain!
Hands to braces.
Stand by, all!
No birds.
It's smarter than we think.
The line's been severed.
It's below us.
Whoa!
Jacob!
Whoa!
Don't worry, lad.
- We got it right where we want it.
- Jacob, look out!
Jacob!
Man overboard! Hard to port!
- Haul them lines, ya swabs!
- Hard to port!
Whoa!
Time has come, ya devil!
Captain.
- Captain.
- He's coming to.
Captain! Captain!
Captain, the mizzen's in splinters,
and I don't like the main.
She can't fight.
Then we'll come back
for the Bluster when she can.
- Repairs shouldn't take too...
- Set a course for Three Bridges.
We're going home.
Right mess, aren't ya?
Let's get you fixed up.
If you know
what's good for ya,
you'll keep clear of the captain.
He was close enough
to smell that red devil.
But if he can't have the Bluster's hide,
he'll have ours, to be sure.
Why, it's gloomy
as the Helgard trenches in here.
We've taken
some right proper monsters on this hunt,
and the royals will pay us accordingly.
And then we'll come back,
and we'll take that red devil.
Can we beat it, Jacob?
They say the Bluster moves the very sea.
Aye, and it shoots fireballs
out of its eyes, they say.
It's enough to make your knees wobble.
But I ain't afraid,
'cause I'm on the Inevitable with you lot.
This ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other,
and she's got the scars to prove it.
As do we, Jacob!
Aye.
And every hunter's scar is a life saved.
A merchant sailor on their first voyage.
A mother.
A son.
All hunters die of the same thing.
Aye, being a hunter.
That's right. Being a hunter.
But every hunter dies a great death.
Because every hunter lives a great life!
Jacob!
Captain would like a word.
Speaking of dying a great death.
Nice knowing you, Jacob!
We'll think of you often and fondly.
You wanted to see me, Captain?
Sit.
Captain, we'll get the Bluster.
We know where it is now,
and you will have your revenge.
I'm... I'm just sorry it wasn't today.
Jacob, I hate that devil
with every fiber in me being,
but saving Jim Nicklebones
was the right thing to do.
You steered me right today.
Well, I'm... I-I'm glad you see it that way.
So we'll go home,
collect our bounty, and repair the ship.
And we'll come back for that beast
and bring hell down upon it.
And then what?
What is to become of the Inevitable
after I'm gone?
Through battle and wear,
every beam, block,
and spar has been replaced
since the day she was launched.
Yet she lives on.
It's an eternal thing.
But I am not.
Come.
Here is my greatness.
My father's before me,
and his father's before him.
On the day we take the Red Bluster,
I will make me last entry as captain.
Then it'll be your time.
I've known it since the day
I pulled you from the sea.
You'd been out there for days.
But there was something in you, Jacob.
A fire that wouldn't die.
Then I held you,
and I knew.
The fates had brought me a son.
And that one day,
you would be captain of the Inevitable.
The day you found me,
I swore I would do everything in my power
to keep people safe from them demons.
If you would grant me this ship,
I would accept,
and it would be my honor.
My boy.
You're gonna do great things.
It's the Inevitable!
The Inevitable's back!
- Look!
- What a sight!
Bet she's got a belly full of bones!
The Inevitable!
It's good to be home at last,
but it will be a short stay, I'm afraid.
Captain Crow will visit
the king and queen at first light.
And when the ship is ready,
we'll be off to kill a monster!
We're going after the Red Bluster!
So if this be our last visit
to Three Bridges,
I expect some right, proper debauchery!
Go on, then.
Make way for the hunters.
Here we go, mates!
The Crown will pay well for them horns.
So the drinks are on us!
No one goes thirsty tonight, swabbies!
Come on, then!
♪ Captain Crow is our hero
He keeps the oceans clear ♪
♪ He stabs, and shoots
And kills, and guts ♪

Hmm.
Hello!
Hello.
Me name's Maisie.
Maisie Brumble.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
And you're Jacob Holland,
who once killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days.
Is it true you done that?
Four in two days?
- Don't believe everything you hear, lass.
- Four in two days?
It was five.
I heard...
I heard there was a time them beasts
used to come right up to shore,
pluck a lady
right out of her veggie patch,
and swallow her up!
But not no more.
And it's 'cause of the hunters.
There's not a nobler profession, I says.
I come from a long line of hunters meself.
Is that so?
Aye. Me parents were lancers.
They served on the Monarch.
The Monarch.
- So they're...
- Aye.
That's just the way for a hunter,
ain't it?
You live a great life
and die a great death.
Huh. Come on.
So, uh, who's looking after you then?
I'm staying at a children's home
in Guelston, up the way.
Except I ain't staying exactly.
I'm on the run, you see.
And I ain't going back.
'Cause I'm joining your crew.
Oh, no, you ain't.
A hunting ship ain't no place for a kid.
You joined the ship when you were me age,
and look at you now.
You're a weapon
against nature's darkest design.
It says so on page 92.
Look, kid, I'm clever with a spear,
but I've been lucky more than once.
There's no guarantee
of making it to page 92.
Trust me.
Now, you should run along.
Right, then. I'll talk to Captain Crow.
That's a man with real authority.
Do you know
where I might find Captain Crow?
Hey! I... I have authority.
- All right?
- You ain't captain, are ya?
Uh, no, but I am captain material.
"Captain material?"
- Sorry. It just sounds funny.
- I mean, I will be captain.
- Someday.
- Well, I intend to get on that ship.
So, if you don't mind,
I'll take it up with Captain Now,
not Captain Someday.
Hey! Put me down! Let me go!
Monster hunters are supposed to be heroes.
And here's me saving you.
Evening, Rosie. You go through Guelston?
Aye.
Right. Let her out there and not before.
- If that's not too much trouble.
- Aye.
Hey!
This is kidnapping!
No, love. It's the opposite
of kidnapping.
New friend, Jacob?
Ah, just some kid.
Urgh. Horrible things, children.
You can say that again.
- Captain Crow!
- It's full of brickleback!
Well, if it isn't Captain Crow
and his loyal mates.
Your Grace, as you can see,
the oceans have offered abundant prey.
And I see you've taken
a full-grown brickleback.
A specimen like that
garners quite a bounty.
But there's something I don't see.
The horn of the Red Bluster.
Admiral Hornagold has reported a rumor...
Admiral Hornagold?
...that you spotted the Red Bluster,
but abandoned your pursuit
because of a certain code.
The royals don't pay you
to honor such codes.
They pay you to kill monsters.
How many more ships will be lost
because you let the Bluster slip away?
This was once a small kingdom
with a big idea.
To send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores
and usher in a new era of peace.
It's been hundreds of years
since the dark times,
but as long as the Bluster lives,
people will still
look to the seas with fear.
So today marks the beginning of a new era.
The Crown will no longer
support the hunters.
She's quite a sight, isn't she?
The Imperator is the most
heavily-armed ship ever to set sail.
The Royal Navy will push
deep into the unknown world
and eradicate every sea beast in our path.
Not in that thing.
She rests too low.
And them fixed cannons is useless.
And her Captain is an ass.
It's time
for you to leave, Captain.
Your time is up.
Admiral, have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasn't hanging from a ceiling?
Don't send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that.
It's not built for hunting,
and neither are you.
I assure you,
I am not afraid of those beasts.
Then you're a fool!
And you'll take
a lot of good sailors down with you!
General, see the hunters out.
We're done with them.
We hunters have shed blood,
while you lot hid behind walls
and drew lines on maps.
You're cowards, the lot of ya!
General, the Captain
is to be placed under arrest,
and the Inevitable decommissioned.
W-W-Wait, wait!
Uh, Your Grace.
The, uh... The Captain
is well-known for his temper,
but his talents as a hunter
have served you well.
He's opened the seas
and made your empire
the envy of the known world.
Now, I believe the world
still needs the hunters,
so prove me wrong.
Give us one more try for the Bluster.
If we take it, you keep your promise,
and we continue our alliance.
If the Imperator takes the Bluster,
well, you can tear down
the Inevitable for scrap,
and the days of the hunters will be over.
Either way,
you win.
I, for one, would relish the opportunity.
Then we have a contest.
Get set.
Go.
We'll take the Bluster
and bring it to your doorstep.
The days of hunters are not over.
Not nearly.
When we reach the Dregmorr,
we'll follow the trenches.
We stay battle-ready, clear decks,
sharpened flints, and fresh cartridge.
The Bluster's hide will be plenty thick.
Best to use the long spears.
Them archers won't do any good,
but we've got plenty of carcass shot.
We'll hit it with fire,
then go for a sleigh ride.
That's the way with something like this.
We're ready, Captain.
We'll take that red demon.
For we are hunters.
And we will bring all of our skill
and all of our rage down upon this beast.
And there will be justice!
But that will not be the end
of this great ship.
For no one has sailed
beyond the Dregmorr Sea.
No one knows what dangers lurk
in that terrible unknown.
But it will be this ship,
under Jacob Holland,
that will pierce the darkness.
So let's drink to a successful hunt,
with many more to come.
- Ow!
- What was that?
- It came from the keg.
- What was that?
You stowed away?
I stowed away.
You stowed away.
Uh, I...
Yeah.
Well, we're dropping you off
at the nearest port.
We're going after the Bluster.
- We can't have a kid mucking about.
- What's this?
The name's Maisie Brumble,
but you need no introduction.
You've been swallowed whole,
shot through the heart, and cut to pieces.
But the worms won't eat you,
and hell won't take you, so here you are!
The right, proud commander
of the second-greatest hunting ship
what ever sailed.
Second-greatest?
Which then, may I ask, is the greatest?
I'm partial to the Monarch,
for it's the ship me parents served on.
I see.
Then they died heroes, didn't they?
Aye.
I like this kid.
- She's all vinegar.
- But, C-Captain...
Sarah, be good enough to take her in,
would you?
Aye, Captain.
Congratulations, Captain Someday.
Uh...
Sleep there.
You're... Sarah Sharpe.
They say no first mate
is more loyal than...
That's enough.
I've heard your speeches, Miss.
My speeches kept me on this boat.
You're on this boat because Captain Crow
won't stop to put you off it.
The hunt is all.
So give him your absolute obedience.
Or fall on that yourself,
because I'll visit worse than death on ya.
You're
amazing.
We passed Rum Pepper Island in the night.
We've reached the Dregmorr.
Aye, and we'll find
that thing soon enough.
I wonder if I might need
something a little... larger?
Hey, where'd you get that knife?
Sarah gave it to me,
'cause I'm a hunter now.
- A hunter who needs to go to bed.
- But I'm too much awake to sleep.
I'm on the Inevitable with Captain Crow.
Them pictures in me books come to life,
and exacting bloody revenge!
Go, get your rest.
Aye, Captain.
We's gonna kill that thing, ain't we?
And they'll make statues of us.
We'll kill it, all right. Now get!
Hmm.
The monsters, I can handle.
But that one, she'll be the death of me.
You'll recall the hunter's code
binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.
I see a fire in her.
Same fire I saw in you.
Beat to quarters!
Let's have her ready!
Today's the day we do what we do!
Fighting trim! Clew up fore a' main!
Harpooners, tie off them darts!
We're going for a sleigh ride!
Heave away!
Brace!
The ocean has sent us its worst,
and we'll send it right back.
Carcass shot if you please, gunners!
Protect our broadside.
All right, ya fish killers!
We come all this way
for a proper fight and...
Jacob!
What's happening?
Maisie, get back to your room!
Go.
Stay away from the window.
Hurry, lad!
Fire!
Now's our chance! Spears!
We got it hooked. Now we'll wear it down.
Full sail, Ms. Merino!
Square the yards!
Get it off the pins!
It'll fight the very wind
till there's no fight left in it.
Run, ya devil! And there we'll be!
Captain?
We've got you now.
The ship can't take it.
We have to cut the lines.
I've never run from a fight,
and I won't start now.
We must!
Even dead, it'll drag us to the bottom!
Time has come for ye, ye devil.
Maisie Brumble, cut those lines,
and I'll kill you for a coward!
Jacob, stop her!
Jacob!
Bring her to me!
- What are you gonna do?
- I said bring her to me!
- She's just a child.
- I'm giving you an order!
Please, Captain.
Bring... her... to... me.
Jacob!
Are we gonna
die in here?
No.
Well,
yeah.
Is it gonna chew us,
or will we get digested slowly with acids?
I don't know, Maisie.
This is all new territory for me.
Haven't you hunted these things
your whole life?
We kill 'em, lass. We don't study 'em.
I guess it's time to start.
Jacob,
what if it swallows you?
Cut the rope.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna kill it.
Kill it? How?
Well, I don't know.
I just get pumped up and kind of wing it.
I don't want to overthink this, all right?
I'm just gonna kill it.
I don't know about this.
I'm Jacob Holland, remember,
who killed five of them beasts
in the span of two days.
And this is just another beast.
There has to be another way!
Afraid not, lass.
Well, c-can you kill it from the inside?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hold on, lass.
Huh?
Jacob!
No, wait!
Oof!
W-W-Wait, Jacob! No!
Stop!
Oh bloody hell.
Whoa!
Whoa. Whoa!
You could've killed me!
Wha... I could have killed you?
You got it backwards, lass.
I had it dead to rights,
and you bollocksed it up.
Dead to rights?
I must have been watching
a different fight.
We wouldn't have been fighting at all
if you hadn't cut them lines.
We cut them lines.
No, you cut them lines.
You didn't stop me, did ya?
That's not the same thing.
Isn't it?
No, it isn't.
We'd best find shelter.
Get your strength.
We're leaving in the morning.
Me book says the beasts
used to come right up to shore.
That nowhere was safe.
Is that true?
Of course it's true.
You saw it?
It was before my time,
but everyone knows it's true.
What if them things
ain't as bad as they say?
I mean, the sea is their home.
We went after her, didn't we?
What if we just left 'em alone?
We kill them because they kill us.
Do I need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents?
Should they have just left
the monsters alone?
I... don't know.
Oh, you are lost, girl.
Your parents died heroes.
I want to believe that,
but maybe you can be a hero
and still be wrong.
You're not making...
- You're not making any sense.
- Why did Red swallow us?
Oh, "Red," is it?
She, not it.
I think it's a she, and I think
she was protecting us from Crow.
You're giving that beast
way too much credit.
- He was pointing a gun at you, and he...
- He was pointing it at you, through me.
Because you cut them lines.
I don't wanna argue about it, all right?
'Cause I don't want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters
on this island,
that, that I wouldn't be on
if you hadn't cut them lines!
So we're not arguing?
So what are we doing?
I'm going to gather supplies.
I'll take you to Guelston,
and when I get back to the ship,
we'll finish what we started.
Don't... get killed out there.
I won't make any promises.
Jacob.
Promise.
All right.
I promise.
Captain,
the beast is gone.
We can't stay out here.
That thing took Jacob.
And I want it dead same as you,
but we'll founder if we don't get to port.
She's making more water
than we can pump out.
And the patch we fothered keeps slipping.
If we stay out here much longer,
we'll be sunk.
Shape a course for Mukesh Island.
- But the closest port is...
- Mukesh!
It'll be Mukesh by thunder,
or the ocean floor.
Would you be planning a visit
to Gwen Batterbie, by any chance?
Captain, her wares come
at too steep a price.
To make covenant with the likes of her
is against the hunter's code.
Blast whatever code
would bar me my revenge!
There be no charter over me own.
I'll use Batterbie's methods.
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'd cleave the very sea
and destroy everything that swims,
scuttles, or bobs if I have to.
But I'll have vengeance.
I'll have vengeance.
Trim the sails
for a new course! Keep her full and by!
Hey, little guy.
These things ain't so bad.
Uh...
What are you doing?
I, uh...
I'm afraid anything I say will upset you.
You're probably right.
Just don't move.
I'm sorry,
but I've always wanted a pet.
That's not a pet.
It's a monster, and we're not keeping it.
But I already named it.
Let me guess.
Blue.
You named that one Red.
You named this one Blue.
We stay much longer, and we'll have
a rainbow of critters that wanna eat us.
But he's so cute!
Look at this face.
You and I have a different idea of cute.
No!
When we get to Guelston,
I'll get you a cat,
and you can name it Grey or White.
Ginger, if you like.
You're too young to be this mean.
And you're too old
to be giving in to childish temptations.
It ain't childish to want a pet.
Lots of people have pets.
Not pets that will lay eggs in your mouth
that hatch and burst out
through your chest cavity!
That is so specific.
Well, I seen some things, all right?
Point is we don't know what he'd do.
We don't know anything about this island,
except we've got to get off it,
by thunder!
Uh...
Best be going.
Maybe they're bonded to us, like geese.
It's the mother goose I'm worried about.
There she is. Come on, lass.
Hmm.
Hold the rudder.
If we can make it to Rum Pepper Island,
we'll be able to flag a ship.
The Dregmorr is thick with monsters,
but don't worry.
If there's one of them things
within a mile of us, I'll sense it.
May be a little off my game here.
Jacob!
Hold on, Maisie!
Maisie.
Maisie?
Maisie!
Maisie!
Good boy.
We have to go back.
- We'll never make it!
- Depends on how fast you can bail.
Maybe Red can take us!
Back to the island?
No, back home!
You have really lost it.
She saved us from that thing, didn't she?
Wait... She...
Are you...
I think I did the saving, right?
I mean, I threw the, the...
Get bailing! The water's coming in!
Hey!
Red!
See this little guy?
This is you.
You're wasting your time.
And this is me.
And this is him.
Are you putting on a puppet show?
We're sinking here.
We need to get way over there.
And I wonder
if you might be good enough to take us?
Well, if she does understand ya,
she don't wanna help.
Bright side? She didn't eat ya.
Now, get bailing.
Whoa!
I told you she was more than a beast!
Woo!
The world is wide, Jacob.
And you don't know everything.
With the right heading,
we'll be there in three days.
All right, beast.
I need you to turn.
Okay? Can you turn?
Can you turn to starboard, yeah?
To the right.
Right, ya dumb beast. Right.
- Can you turn to the right? That way!
- You can scream all day.
She don't understand ya.
Oh, she understands, all right.
She's just being monstrous.
I need you
to turn to the starboard.
Over there, right where I'm pointing?
That's starboard. That's the right.
More to the right.
Look, see? Over there, right!
Turn to the right,
you infernal bloody sea beast!
He's wondering if you might turn a smidge.
Like this, see?
That's it!
Thanks, girl!
Not so hard.
She ain't no pet.
Just don't let your guard down, all right?
You can relax, Captain.
She's a friend.
- Yeah, right. Till she gets hungry.
- Oh, will you just...
Hmm.
- Is that the Inevitable?
- What are they doing here?
Captain!
We don't need this. We're hunters.
Only if we kill it.
I know why you're here, Captain.
It's always the same reason, you see.
And I can give you what you need.
A poison powerful enough
to take down the greatest of beasts,
and a weapon strong enough
to deliver it deep.
You know what they say about me, Captain?
Them what come see Gwen Batterbie
get what they want,
but won't see a good day after.
Yet, here you are.
I don't believe in them superstitions.
No, I don't suppose you do.
But you will.
It's me most terrible creation.
The Hand of God, I calls it.
What will it cost me?
Everything, Captain.
I take everything.
So, do we have a deal?
Huh?
Yeah, well, you know, I'm, uh...
I'm used to a bigger target, all right?
Huh.
Dinner time!
It says here that during the dark times,
the beast destroyed a town
on the coast of Kra' Zoul.
But we been up and down that coast,
and I ain't never seen no town,
destroyed or otherwise.
A-And... And we don't say "yar"
half this much.
E-Every other page, we're shouting "yar."
I mean, this is just nonsense.
Says you.
But the book says otherwise,
and it's going to outlast both of us.
So people will believe
the beasts destroy towns that don't exist,
and hunters like to say "yar."
But if that ain't true,
then how are you supposed to know what is?
And how do we know the sea beasts
ever plucked ladies
out of their veggie patches?
That there really were the dark times?
Maybe they didn't start this war.
Maybe, but
why would we?
Looks like a real shipwrecker.
Nicer down here, I'd say.
Aye.
Nicer down here.
I don't know how the war started.
Maybe all that matters is how it ends.
It's a blood moon.
Batterbie's watching.
Honor is the currency of hunters, it is.
And dealing with her ain't honorable.
Aye. There'll be a payment due,
and it's the ship
and all aboard who'll suffer the cost.
Sarah!
Look there.
Riddlebacks.
Aye.
They don't come this far north.
Not unless they're swimming
away from something.
And there's only one thing
what scares a riddleback.
The Bluster.
Ms. Merino, shape a new course.
Due south, if you please.
Alee of Rum Pepper Island.
Aye, captain.
You heard him! Get it off the pins!
Haul away now!
Haul away, all!
We'll find you.
We'll find you soon enough.
That ain't you no more.
You're not Jacob Holland
who killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days.
It was five.
You're Jacob Holland
who befriended a beast,
saved me life,
and led us all the way
to Rum Pepper Island.
We made it.
This is as far as Red goes.
Won't be safe for her beyond the Dregmorr,
but we can flag a passing ship.
And then what?
Well, then I'll, uh,
take you to Guelston, won't I?
And what about you?
Guelston is a place.
It ain't a family.
I ain't going back there,
and you ain't going back on that ship.
So all you have is me.
And all I have is you.
And that don't sound so bad.
So, what do you say?
Should we give it a go?
You mean, uh...
You mean, like a family?
Sure.
I-I don't know.
Maybe if we pretend long enough,
it could feel real?
Never mind. It's stupid.
What, are you picturing us on a farm
or something?
I said "never mind," ya donkey.
So never mind.
It's just I-I don't think I'm...
You got something in your ears?
All right, all right.
Well, guess, uh, we'd better pack up.
Well, girl, this has been
an improbable adventure.
And I thank you
for all you've done, but, uh,
it's time to go home now.
And I promise
I'll never hunt sea monsters again.
No more monster hunting!
Hang about.
Okay.
No more!
No more!
Ow!
Jeez!
Look, you understand
the point I'm trying to make here, right?
It's a... It's a symbolic gesture.
I think she understands.
All right, then.
Time to go home.
Go on, girl. Go home.
Red?
Red!
Oh no.
Need a hand here.
Red, listen to me.
Just leave.
This doesn't have to be a fight.
No, Red. Go.
- Go on, Red. Just leave them be.
- Red, we have to go. Please!
No, Red! No!
Red! Come back!
All hands, to arms!
Fire away!
Maisie!
No, Red! Stop!
Maisie!
Maisie!
Are you all right, lass?
Is Red okay?
Hold fast!
Stay back, beast. Leave her be.
It's the Red Bluster.
The beast is delivered!
No, lass.
There's nothing to be done.
She doesn't have to do this.
Yes, she does.
Ready the Hand of God!
Now is the reckoning.
For all who've been lost,
I strike at thee, devil!
Don't fight.
You'll make the poison flow faster.
I don't want you to die. Not yet.
Not till you've been immortalized
at Castle Whiterock.
Captain, might be wiser
to let the poison finish the job.
No, Sarah.
I made a promise to the king and queen.
But I'd not worry.
There's no fight left in it.
Yes, there is.
Raise the studding sails!
To starboard, Captain. It's a boat!
Hold!
By the powers...
Jacob.
I see.
That's quite a story, Jacob.
The hunter what befriended a beast. Hmm.
The beast what took me deadlight.
What am I to make of ye, Jacob?
That thing and I,
we, uh, had, uh,
an understanding.
A truce. Hmm?
But there cannot be a truce without war.
Whatever happened out there is nothing
against hundreds of years of war.
I've always known what I was, Jacob.
I'm the son of a captain,
who was the son of a captain.
And if we are born to fight,
then by God, let's fight.
That we may be tested
and find our greatness.
So I ask you, Jacob, my son,
are you my enemy?
Maisie, stop!
Let her go!
She's all vinegar.
Easy, lass. Easy. There you go.
You need to help Red.
She's our friend.
I'm sorry.
She needs her rest.
I'll get you back to Guelston.
You'll be safe.
You'll have a good, long life.
But first, we'll pay a visit
to Castle Whiterock.
We have a date with the king and queen.
Jacob, I imagine you could use a drink.
Welcome home, lad.
Good to see ya.
So good to see you.
You're home, Jacob.
Let's toast to the many adventures
that lay ahead of you,
as captain of the Inevitable.
You're getting your strength back.
Too late.
Maybe.
It's not right what they're doing to Red.
She saved us.
You have to believe me, please.
I believe you.
Then help me stop them.
I've been fighting them beasts
all me life,
and I've seen things
that will never go away.
This ship is all I know.
No first mate
more loyal than Sarah Sharpe.
Crow's done it! He got the Bluster!
The whole world will know
what we've done, me boy.
This ship, your ship, will live on.
Nothing can stop it.
Blue!
Let's see a cat do that.
Open the gate!
It was them!
Oh, girl.
Don't worry, Red.
I-I'll get you out of here.
What is all this?
Why is everyone...
He's done it! He's got the Red Bluster!
- That'll do, Ms. Merino.
- You heard the captain.
Drop anchor.
Captain Crow.
Well, it looks like we have our winner.
When I last visited Whiterock,
you told me
that the days of hunters were over.
But the Imperator
was no match for the beast.
All of your wealth and power,
all of this is nothing
compared to a hunter's fury.
And it's the Inevitable
what will lead the way
into the Dregmorr and beyond.
Until the bones
of every one of them beasts
lies at the bottom of the sea!
Captain!
Jacob,
get back on the ship.
I can't let you do it.
You dishonor me, boy.
As you dishonor all them hunters
what come before.
All them what died heroes.
Aye, they were heroes.
But you can be a hero
and still be wrong.
Now give me the lance.
I thought of you as a son.
But I don't know you.
I gave you everything!
I gave you life!
You've laid down your lance
and think it's made you strong?
But you've turned your back
on your own kind.
- Jacob!
- Jacob!
I should have given you a bigger knife.
Oh!
Whoa!
The hunters brought the beast
to the very heart of our kingdom.
For your queen, for all that is good,
strike it down!
Cannoneers! Take position!
Prepare to fire!
Out of our way, you fools!
Stop!
If you do this, it never ends.
No more monster hunting!
Impossible.
You did good, kid.
I ain't done.
Our books,
our history,
is a lie.
I don't believe the beasts
ever threatened our shores.
It was just a story.
A story told by them!
What?
For generations,
they've taught us to hate the beasts
and sent the hunters out to destroy them.
And the beasts learned
to fear us and hate us,
and they fought back!
Who are you to malign
your king and queen with such falsehoods?
You have no right to speak!
I have every right!
I come from a long line of hunters
that died your great death!
Your kingdom was paid for
with their blood,
and their blood!
Enough! General, give the command.
This war was started
by the kings and queens what come before.
And with every lie, their empire grew.
Now this lot stands on the same perch
and tells the same lies.
For their greed.
General!
Let it end.
Let it end!
Listen to her!
Let the beast go!
Listen to the child!
Now I'm done.
All right, Red.
We best go.
What are you doing?
Fire!
Your queen demands it!
General, shouldn't we fire?
My brother was on the Monarch, Sergeant.
And I want to know how this war started.
That hurt, didn't it?
You have no idea.
Two lives were saved that day.
One man and one beast.
And with that, the world began to change.
No ship would ever sail
the Dregmorr again.
And the mysteries beyond
would remain undisturbed.
I don't think
about it much though.
Red is safe,
and I have everything I need right here.
I'm going to live a great life.
