- For we shall not
rest for one hour,
not one minute until
freedom and democracy
have triumphed over
the forces of evil!
We will crush our
enemies beneath our feet.
Lay waste their farms and towns,
make their children our slaves.
- [Voiceover] So many fond
memories of Maximilian the First
on the 10th anniversary of
our glorious leader's death.
- To threaten out great nation.
- [Voiceover] Many of
course doubted that his son
and heir Maximilian the
Second could live up
to the example of his
charismatic father.
But the man affectionately
known as Junior has valiantly
continued the fight
against the pesky rebellion
led by
playwright-turned-terrorist
John Thorne.
- [Voiceover] Once derided
as the playboy prince more
interested in the movie
business, the president-for-life
today vowed not to rest until
he has rid the country of
these criminals whom he called
quote "really bad guys."
In a gesture of goodwill
to commemorate his father's
passing, the president today
also commuted the sentences
of several men condemned
to the gallows,
sending them to the
guillotine instead.
- [Voiceover] Papa
would have been proud.
- Long live the
House of Bonaventure!
Long live democracy,
long live freedom!

- When I think of the lazy
afternoons of my childhood,
of the bruised skies and
the blank faces of the women
with dirty bare feet by
the side of the road,
I wonder if I should have
stood by and done nothing.
In some way that's
precisely what I did.
I know that I've done
questionable things.
But my role in the assassination
of the President is one
that even now I cannot
say I entirely regret.
They say I'm a war
criminal but everything
I've done, I've
done for my country.
I met Mister Thorne in the
last days of the Empire,
though no one knew then that
they were the last days.
(typewriter clicking)
- In R-28 Prison the dirty
protest by terrorists
of the Citizens for
Justice and Democracy
has entered its fifth year.
Agitating for political
prisoner status,
the terrorists refused the
bathe, perform work details
or participate in
any other activities.
They registered their
protest by using their
own excrement to
smear anti-government
slogans on the walls
of their cells.
- Wow, a mess like that
sounds like it needs the heavy
duty scouring action of
new, improved Ultra-Gleen.
- [Male Anchor] You're
right about that, Jane.
- Fresh as a daisy in here.
You're going to wear the
uniform today, prisoner seven?
- [John] You've asked
me that every morning.
- I ask you that every morning
and every morning you say no.
So, you going to
wear the uniform?
- [John] No.
- You really are a pig,
you know that Thorne?
A filthy fucking pig.
Gimme the regular
criminal any day.
I've been thinkin' about it.
When you gonna give
this silly shit up?
(thud, groan)
You will answer me when
I address you, prisoner.
I said when you
gonna give this up?
- Not gonna.
- Don't fuck with Superman.
- [Joe] How far does a man
have to go to be thought
so dangerous that he
needs to be locked away,
physically separated from
the rest of the world
behind concrete
walls and iron bars?
Clearly it's the last resort.
- Ladies and gentlemen
his excellency,
defender of the constitution,
protector of the faith,
guardian of the people,
master of all that crawls
upon the earth and
swims beneath the sea,
savior of the nation and
the House of Bonaventure,
Generalissimo President-For-Life
Maximilian the Second.
(clapping)
- [Joe] From the start,
Junior ruled the shadow
of his late father.
Papa Max had been a
grade-A son of a bitch,
if ever there was one.
Who'd have thought we'd
look back on his reign
as the good old days.
(cameras flashing)
(tepid trumpet music)
- This is the hour of
our long-awaited victory!
- [Joe] For all his brutality,
papa Max was clever enough
to make us believe that his
tenure was for our benefit.
Junior on the other hand
had been born day-old
stupid and been losing
ground ever since.
Aside from indulging
his interests in murder,
rape and torture he
spent most of his
time running the film industry.
- Action Martina, Martina
do it again faster.
- [Joe] With Junior in power
it was no surprise that Thorne
and his comrades were winning
the war for the nation's soul.
Junior had pillaged
the treasury and filled
Parliament with movie stars.
As Thorne won over the
poor and the middle class
the rich retreated to
their villas in the hills,
hidden behind walls fitted with
firing ports and razor wire.
They send their children
off to private schools
in bulletproof cars to
be taught in French.
Many of the third and
fourth generation children,
the really inbred
ones couldn't even
speak their own native tongue.
- Every field a feast.
- Yo, how's it hangin'?
- How is he this morning?
- How is he, you know, the same.
- Chow time. (scraping)
Prison food, almost as
good as hospital food.
- This used to be a hospital.
- [Joe] What?
- This prison.
It used to be a hospital.
- I read your plays in school.
- You're new, where
do you come from?
- Upstairs, admin section.
- [John] You asked
for this detail?
- Yes sir.
- Why?
- I got tired of pushing paper,
wanted to do something
that made a difference.
- Depends on what's
written on the paper.
- [Joe] This wasn't
my first choice.
- You want to go
fight terrorists.
- Yes sir.
- [John] You don't
approve of what we do?
- Officially sir
I have no opinion.
- You should look
into getting one.
(tepid trumpet music)
- Good morning Mrs.
President, Madame.
- Chuck, I thought you
were out on the island.
- Helen gave me the
weekend off, sir.
- What a ball-buster.
- Really.
- [Ted] How is the movie, sir?
- It's coming together.
It's got a certain
je ne sais quoi.
- It's brilliant, he's
just being modest.
- Yeah no I'm happy with it.
It's just I have
to be on set for
the next one at six tomorrow.
- No rest for the
wicked, eh sir?
- What?
- Nothing sir.
- Will this be our
chance to see Madame's
long-rumored return
to the silver screen?
- Ooh no no no, my official
duties keep me far too busy.
- And big congratulations
on your triple-double
the other night, sir.
- Yeah you know it's
the end of the season,
everyone takes it
to a higher level.
- But to score 50
points in the same game.
- Yeah no I was in the
zone, what can I say.
You're not a basketball
fan, are you Ted?
Only during the playoffs sir.
- Because you're a
big fag, that's why.
Big fag, no I'm kidding
Ted, I'm kidding.
Okay so what's the buzz?
Tell me what's happening,
why the emergency?
- [Ted] Another monk
immolated himself.
- Is it really necessary
to bother the president
with the antics of
these malcontents?
We don't need to know every
time there's a barbecue.
- Well having priests killing
themselves doesn't help us
in the polls with the dirty
protests still going on.
- The comfort of
criminals is not
of great concern to the state.
- [Ted] It's not a question
of comfort, Madame.
Thorne's people
are starting to win
the war for hearts and minds.
- Lemme tell you something Ted.
When you've got
them by the balls,
their hearts and
minds will follow.
- Come with me.
Come on!
(defecating)
- So where are we
with the monk thing?
- It's all under control, sir.
We're rounding up
the usual suspects.
Our element in the
press will as ever blame
Thorne's people for the
atmosphere of anarchy.
Blase, blase, blase.
- But that won't be enough,
bottom line we can't
signal weakness when
our freedom is at stake.
- Hand me soft paper, would you?
- [Ted] Sure.
- So what did you have in mind?
(tepid trumpet music)
- Have a good year.
(explosion)
(explosion, gunshot)
(tepid trumpet music)
(explosion)
- [Voiceover] In other news
Imperial forces continue
their crackdown on terrorist
activity as ordered
by his excellency
Maximilian the Second.
Both political parties argued
that the heinous crimes of
John Thorne and his followers
left the government no choice.
- It's clear from these
cowardly and barbaric acts
that we need to reestablish
law and order in
the face of this threat
to our peace and freedom.
- It's clear from these
cowardly and barbaric acts
that we need to reestablish
law and order in
the face of this threat
to our peace and freedom.
- Congressman Barth is
of course familiar from
such films as Landslide
One, Two and Four.
Senator Lyme had a
distinguished career on
the stage but is best
known as Pattie Maloney
from the popular
television show,
I'll Tell Y'As When I've
Had Too Much to Drink.
- [Joe] Those who dismissed
Junior as a mere buffoon
foolishly underestimated
our volatile boy king
and often paid with their lives.
- [John] Did you ever hear
about that oracle that warned
Papa Max that one day his
wife was gonna give birth to
a son who was gonna kill
him and destroy the Empire?
- [Joe] Yeah, I hear that.
- People wonder why
Junior's a psychopath.
(shouting)
- No!
- You would be too if your
father tried to stick a coat
hanger through your head
when you were a fetus.
- I thought that
was an urban myth.
- He was a student at my
wife's school until his father
decided he's be better
off with private tutors.
He gave them such shit.
- So you believe that
Junior killed his father?
- [John] You believe that Papa
Max's death was an accident?
- [Joe] It wasn't?
- [John] Well I didn't
see Junior tryin' to
poke his eyes out over it.
(upbeat rock music)
- [Joe] Thorne's group
is called the Citizens
for Justice and Democracy.
Personally I preferred
terrorist groups that sounded
like rock bands, Black
September, Action Direct,
Red Army Faction.
I also liked the
Weathermen back when
they had their original drummer.
Thorne's movement had
started as a flimsy
coffeehouse protest,
nobody gave a shit.
But as Junior cracked down
Thorne's followers turned
to violence, or maybe it
was the other way around.
- Monsieur John Thorne.
(speaking French)
- [Joe] By the time
Junior put him in prison,
Thorne was becoming a folk hero
while being heard
with a machine gun.
(speaking French)
- [John] You're a soldier
Joe, I assume you believe
there are things worth
dying for, killing for?
- Yes sir I do, but we don't
kill innocent bystanders.
- Nobody standing
by is innocent.
I didn't come to violence
casually you know.
But you get to a point
when you have no choice
but to take up arms
against your oppressors.
Be very hard for a
thinking man to deny that.
Actually I should ask
you Joe, is it hard?
- Sir, are you calling me stupid
or are you calling me a coward?
- Every day I sit
here, the revolution
creeps closer and
closer to victory.
The sacrifice of one man's
life is a small price to pay.
- And you think that one man
can make that much difference?
- The name Rudolph
Hess ring a bell?
- German figure skater.
- He was Adolf
Hitler's right-hand man
until the Second World War.
- [Joe] Yes I know who he was.
- When the war was over
he was put on trial
at Nuremberg with the
other Nazi big wigs.
Sentenced to life and the
city of Berlin there was
a penitentiary, Spandau Prison.
That's where they put them.
40 years he was there,
21 of them on his own.
21 years all alone
in Spandau Prison.
So powerful was this
specter of this one man
that after he was dead,
they tore down Spandau.
They wanted no trace
of him left behind.
- Nice role model, a Nazi.
- No no, I'm just
sayin' one man.
One man in his cell,
one man in power,
one man in the right
place at the right time.
- [First Sergeant] There
a problem down there?
- No First Sergeant.
The prisoner just
wanted something.
- He wanted something?
What's this, a fuckin' hotel?
If I catch you bullshitting
with the prisoners again,
especially that prisoner,
I'll beat you like a
red-headed stepchild
and skull-fuck your corse.
* I'm through with
you beautiful hat
* I've never let nothin' be easy
* Let it be like
the nest of a dream

are to rise up and sing
* As likely as birds to
fly out of this thing *
- Recapping our
top story tonight,
government official
kidnapped from his
country home
outside the capitol.
Shown here is the
getaway vehicle, the
Henley Triton V-Six.
Triton, for comfort and
safety the best-selling
full size sedan in the world.
- [Anchorwoman] Police today
confirmed that the kidnapping
was the work of the Citizens
for Justice and Democracy,
which released this video.
- I admit that I am guilty
of these nasty crimes against
the people and of perpetuating
the pig power of rule.
- Authorities say the
confession appears
to have been coerced.
Now stay tuned for Friends.
(anxious tones)
- Long slogan today.
- [John] I had a
big meal last night.
- Who said it?
- Carlos Morales, Second
Critique of Oligarchy.
You should read it.
- I'm waiting for the movie.
So he was a friend of yours,
the famous professor Morales?
- My mentor.
- [Joe] I heard he fled,
self-imposed exile they say.
- [John] Well some say he
was dumped into the sea
from a helicopter in one of
those midair interrogations.
- And what do you think?
- Doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter
what you think or it
doesn't matter what
happened to him?
- Doesn't matter.
- How do you remember it all
like that, word for word?
- My entertainment options
are kind of limited.
- Have you memorized
anything else?
- Shakespeare, some
books of the Bible,
Eliot, Yates.
- Bullshit.
- Turning and turning
in the widening gyre,
the falcon cannot
hear the falconer.
Things fall apart, the
center cannot hold.
Mere anarchy is
loosed upon the world.
Blood-dimmed tide is loosed,
everywhere the ceremony
of innocence is drowned.
That was my wife's
favorite poem.
They came for her in
the middle of the night,
the time-honored way.
At least I got a trial.
- When was this?
- Long time ago.
Junior was still running the
secret police for his father.
- I heard that he did
a lot of the high level
interrogations himself.
- Yeah, yeah I heard that too.
- And your son?
- In hiding.
- [Joe] How long
since you've seen him?
- Nine years.
Surely some
revelation is at hand.
Surely the Second
Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming, hardly
are those words out when
a vast image out of Spiritus
Mundi troubles my sight.
Somewhere sent into the desert,
a shape with lion's body
and the head of a man.
A gaze blank and pitiless
as the sun is moving
its slow thighs while
all about it reel
shadows of the
indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops
again but now I know
that 20 centuries of
stony sleep were vexed
to nightmare by
a rocking cradle.
And what rough beast, its
hour come 'round at last
slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born?
Better go.
(tepid trumpet music)
- What's the name of this
latest masterpiece anyway?
- Out For Vengeance Four.
- Christ.
- What can we expect I wonder?
- Same as before.
- Yippy.
- Is this a joke?
- Yeah but this time (gun
cocks) the joke's on you.
- You're never gonna get away
with this you mother fucker.
- [Mike] Shut the fuck up.
- Get your stinkin' paws off
of her you damn, dirty ape.
- I want to see Trey
a little longer.
- Well sir that's
a problem 'cause
it's really all I
have of that take.
Mike moves the gun right
after Trey says "hell."
- I'll see you in hell.
- Fuck.
See one of the hallmarks
of my style that
I'm known for is subtext.
All great filmmakers have
subtext and mise-en-scène, no?
Lots of mise-en-scène,
we have to have that.
- Yes sir, absolutely.
- [Maximilian] So I need
that shot to be longer.
- Unfortunately sir that
is the longest take--
(electricity crackling,
chains rattling)
Maybe if I slow it down.
- Let's discuss this
like rational men.
- Sorry we have a strict policy.
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.
- You're a sad mother
fucker aren't you?
- What do you think?
- It seems a little cheesy.
- Really?
- Maybe a different speed.
- We'll remember
you as a murderer.
- Face it Johnny,
you got greedy.
Didn't you ever learn not
to shit where you eat?
- I'll see you in hell.
- Save me a place in the shade.
(gunshot, screaming)
- Yeah that's
better, that's good.
It's really coming
together isn't it?
- It has a certain
je ne sais quoi.
- Yes, it has a certain je
ne sais quoi doesn't it?
(rattling)
- [Voiceover] Mister
President, Monsieurs Smith
and Jones are still
waiting for you up here.
- Okay, I'll be right up.
Je ne sais quoi.
- Sir, will you have someone
come and refill my water dish?
- [Maximilian] Of course Walter.
I've really never
met an actress who is
quite as extraordinary
as this one.
- The public find her
very amusing, sir.
- I also think she's
extremely intelligent.
- Wonderful red hair.
- [Maximilian] What is this?
- Chicken, sir.
- So what are you telling me,
we're still losing the
hearts and minds thing?
- Let's just say the
campaign isn't going
quite as well as we'd like.
(gunshots)
- So where were we?
- Hearts and minds sir.
- [Maximilian] Right.
- The main thing we
need right now sir is to
defuse the credibility
of the prison protests.
- I take it you've
got a plan, tell me.
You have a plan?
- Well a statement from a high
profile political prisoner
would be ideal, something
disavowing the protests.
- Who do you have in mind?
- Well Thorne of course,
he's the only one
with that kind of credibility.
- You think Thorne's gonna
make a statement on our behalf?
He won't even wear fucking
clothes on our behalf.
- Anybody can be
made to talk, sir.
- [Maximilian] Prisoner
number seven formerly
known as Thorne, John M.
Greetings from his royal
highness Maximilian the Second.
Now about your son.
You'll be glad to know
that after a lengthy search
of many years we've finally
succeeded in locating him.
I assume you'd want
to see him alive.
It's a very simple
proposition we're offering.
We will guarantee the
safety of your son and will
arrange regular visits
for you with him.
- In exchange for what?
- [Maximilian] Just a few
kind words on our behalf.
- Go fuck yourself.
(anxious guitar tones)
- Don't do this to yourself.
- [John] I didn't realize
this was self-inflicted.
- You know what I mean.
- [John] Hear you
got your transfer.
So you still believe
in Junior enough
to go risk your life for him?
- I'm willing to risk
my life for my country.
(mumbling)
- Good evening, I bring
you holiday greetings from
the public detention
facility R-28.
As you know the
anti-government campaign of
the Citizens for Justice
and Democracy has recently
resulted in several violent
acts of public disobedience.
Accordingly the officials here
have asked me to relate to
you firsthand that we prisoners
are being treated very well.
Rumors to the contrary are vile
anti-government propaganda.
Conditions inside the
detention facility
are humane and generous.
- Naturally there has
been great public interest
in the first glimpse of
the celebrated playwright
and dissident in
more than five years.
- [Anchorwoman] He
appears to have some sort
of facial twitching, Jim.
- Let's go to Tom Enfield,
our terrorism expert
who is with us by
satellite, Tom?
- [Voiceover] Jim, I'm not
sure if that's a tick or
if he's trying to blink
something in code.
Morse code, T-O-R-T-E.
(relaxed guitar
music, emergency tone)
- Smart guy, huh?
I told you don't
fuck with Superman.
Hit the prisoner.
- First Sergeant?
- Smack the prisoner!
You have a problem with
disciplining prisoners
or with that specific prisoner?
- No, First Sergeant.
(thud, grunt)
- Again.
(thud)
Again!
(repeated thuds, grunts)
Go stand outside.
Close the door.
(thuds)
(relaxed guitar tones)
(relaxed guitar music)
(weeping)
* Likely as stones are
to rise up and sing
* Likely as birds to
fly out of this thing *
- When I think of the lazy
afternoons of my childhood,
of the briny smell of sea
air in the cool evenings,
I think also of the blood
red moon and the bare
trees the color of rust.
Thorne's performance
on television stirred
a hornet's nest.
The final straw came
when he was elected to
Parliament from inside R-28.
There was a lot of controversy
as he was a playwright
with only limited
acting experience.
But after that Junior
had no choice but to
grant Thorne political
prisoner status.
- Frank, that fax last
night was illegible.
Get them to change
that cartridge on
the machine, please.
- Yes sir.
- [Joe] Thorne wrote me
during the three years I spent
in Battalion Six, the elite
counter-terrorist unit
the army wouldn't even
officially admit existed.
We hunted his terrorist army
in a place we call the Haunted
Wood, the place where I
would meet my wife Madeleine.
He wrote "When I finally
go back to the town where I
"was born, will I find the
trees burned down to the ground?
"Everything they taught
you in school is wrong."
- They inject the chicken
when they're young.
That's why it's so juicy.
- Do they inject
it when it's alive?
- What am I, an expert
on chicken farming?
I don't know shit like that.
You give me a good
steak any day.
Nothin' better than
a big, juicy steak.
- What kind of woman
comes to a strip club?
- A lesbian.
Why don't you go over and
strike up a casual conversation
with her, you hesitate a lot.
- That's very helpful.
- You know me, I'll fuck a
snake if you hold its head.
- Snake, you fucked
a sea cow. (laughs)
- Why do you gotta
bring that up?
We said we're never
gonna speak of it.
Seriously man, we
had an agreement.
You can't just go and
break it like that.
- [Joe] Okay, so what
am I gonna say to her?
- Just go on over and say to
her, "Hi, my name is Joe."
- [Joe] Hi, my name's Joe.
- I'm gonna fuck
you into next week.
Don't say that, just
say "Hi, my name's Joe."
(samba music, singing)
I gotta do everything for him.
- Hi.
My name is Joe.
- [Madeleine] Madeleine.
- Nice to meet you, Madeleine.
Is that your boyfriend?
- Kind of.
- How secure would you
say his position is
on a scale of one to 10?
- Is 10 more secure
or less secure?
- I'd say 10 is more secure.
- One.
- Well may I sit down?
- Yeah, okay.
- No way brother,
pot's legal in Sweden.
- Would you mind if I
gave you a call sometime?
- Oh man not only has
this chick got no tits,
no ass and she can't
dance, she is butt ugly.
- That's my wife.
- Can we get the
check over here?
- 24 years in the
foreign service and this
is where it's got me.
- Just relax, we'll
see if we can get him
alone without Yoko.
- [Skinny Comedian] So I
went to town to sell the cow,
but all I got was
these magic beans.
- [Fat Comedian] Magic beans,
what do you mean magic beans?
(fart, laughs)
- [Skinny Comedian] Oh wee,
that don't smell to magic to me.
- [Fat Comedian] So did you
get any milk from the cow?
- [Skinny Comedian] Nope, it
was an udder failure. (laughs)
- You ain't got the
sense God gave a turnip.
- God have a turnip what?
- [Fat Comedian] Sense.
- Since when?
- [Fat Comedian] No, sense.
- No sense, nonsense.
- [Fat Comedian]
That's what I'm saying.
- [Skinny Comedian]
You is confusing me.
- Confusing me with
what, a turnip?
- No you is confusing
me with your logics.
- And what did you do
when you was in Rome?
- [Skinny Comedian] As
the Romans do, of course.
- [Fat Comedian]
And that voodoo that
they do so well, it was swell.
- Hi Chuck, hi Ted.
You seen these guys
before, they're hilarious.
- No sir.
- You want some popcorn?
- Better not, sir.
- So what's up?
- Terrorists hit another
village last night.
About half the
villagers mutilated,
arms and legs hacked off
a couple a dozen people.
- Oh Jesus, what
did the markets do?
- Nothing good sir, Parliament's
up in arms of course
and it looks like Thorne's
people have locked up
another dozen votes
on the amnesty issue
and announced two new
candidates for the election.
- What's the story
of these candidates?
- One of them spent
four years on a soap,
the other's a Tony winner.
- Tony winner, who gives a shit?
What was he in?
- Chere en de Lieu, a musical.
- I don't know Beauregard,
what is the difference
between an Italian
mother-in-law and an elephant?
- The black dress. (laughs)
- I got to tell you
this new wave of
amputations attacks
is not helping us.
I've got two pictures
opening next weekend,
please tell me you have an idea.
- Release Thorne.
- What?
- Mister President, it's
become increasingly hard
to justify keeping
Thorne in prison.
It's an embarrassment
to have a member
of Parliament locked up.
- There's lots of
politicians in prison Ted,
all over the world.
- Lots more who should be but
as long as Thorne's inside,
he can do no wrong
but if he were out,
he'd be forced to make
some unpopular choices
just like any other politician.
- You don't want some of this?
- What do you think, Chuck?
- Well, it might bring
him down to human size.
On the other hand
it might look as if
we were caving in to terrorism.
- On the contrary, we respond
to violence with compassion,
demonstrating our commitment
to the forum of democracy.
Then let him wither
and die once he becomes
just another mother
fucker in a suit.
- I don't know Hans,
how many Chinamen
does it take to
change a light bulb?
- Two, one to change it and
one to be a slanty-eyed gook.
- It's clever,
I'll give you that.
- Thank you sir.
- But I have to ask you, is
this gonna be a repeat of
the brilliant idea of having
Thorne go on television?
'Cause that was
your idea also, no?
- Well, there are
never any guarantees
but we have to do something.
(relaxed guitar tones)
- Now I know that 20
centuries of stony sleep
were vexed in nightmare
by a rocking cradle.
- And what rough beast, it's
hour come 'round at last
slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born.
- [John] Hello Joe.
- I wasn't sure you'd
remember me, sir.
- Look at you, they've
made you an officer.
- Yes sir and I got married too.
- Congratulations.
How was Battalion Six?
- I am not aware of
any such unit, sir.
- But if you had been in
this mythical Battalion Six,
would you tell me?
- I can neither confirm nor deny
the existence of
such a unit, sir.
It's nothing personal.
- Of course.
- In was nothing personal
in R-28 either, sir.
- I know, very proud of you Joe.
From a humble prison
guard to an officer
in Junior's elite
security corps.
- Last time I saw you, you
were public enemy number one.
- [John] And now?
- Well read the
graffiti, you're a hero.
- You know what they say,
show me a hero and I'll
show you a tragedy.
- You could be Prime Minister
in a year or so I think.
- Do you really think Junior
would ever allow that?
- Well he can't stop the
people from voting, sir.
- If voting could ever
really change anything,
it'd be illegal.
Think of the way he
presents himself now.
In the plural, we, the royal we.
He can't even swim,
did you know that?
- No sir.
- He can't swim.
It's not a crime, it's not
even a drawback really in a
Head of State but when I
think of the number of times I
pulled him out of the swimming
pool at my wife's school,
pulled his fat pink ass
out of the water with him
blubbering and flailing
around like a woman.
I've developed a skin condition.
- I'm sorry to hear that sir.
- I have to sit in
a bath every day.
- You know many people
are very hopeful
now that you're out, sir.
- When I was a young
soldier the army
taught me to look
for the antenna.
You can either hit the
commander or his radio operator.
They still teach you that?
- Something like that.
- So Joe what do you
think is more humane,
to wage a war and kill
thousands of people or go
right to the source,
sacrifice one man?
It seems a small price
to pay, doesn't it?
- Sir that question is
way above my pay grade.
- If you want to kill a
snake, you cut off its head.
- It is our pleasure to
welcome Mister Thorne
and with him a new day in
the history of our country.
He will of course be taking
his seat in Parliament when
it reconvenes next month and
we would like to announce
a new production of his
play, Beneath a Marquee Moon.
We are looking forward to
working with Mister Thorne
in seeking a solution to
the troubles and in shaping
a bright new dawn for our
great nation together.
(applause)
- I'm glad to be out of prison.
(laughs)
(clapping, cameras flashing)
- Mister President,
I assure you sir what
happened this morning
was an anomaly.
- Chuck, could I
borrow your pen?
You know what I think Ted,
I think you're a
little sweet on Thorne.
I think you'd like to suck
his cock, wouldn't you?
His tired old cock, what
do you think Charlie?
I always thought Ted was
a big fag, didn't you?
(piercing, gasps)
Now I wish I didn't
have to do this but it's
bad business to let
failure go unpunished.
It sends the wrong message
to the rest of the staff.
(stabbing, grunts)
Have you read that
book Seven Habits
of Highly Successful People?
Because it helped me a lot.
* Hold my hand
- These people you've surrounded
yourself with are idiots.
None of them can see
how dangerous Thorne is.
Talk about a lean
and hungry look.
What happened today was just
personally insulting to you.
- Well what can I do?
- What if Thorne refuses to
take his seat in Parliament?
- That would probably
mean the end of Parliament
as a governing body
with any kind of,
you know oomph.
- He knows that.
Thorne's just leading us
down the primrose path.
Bonaventure is good, Bonaventure
is kind, the people know.
It's just these terrorist vermin
poisoning the people against us.
You know what you're
gonna have to do.
- Then what?
- Sooner or later.
- I know, I know you're
right but Smith and Johns--
- Fuck Smith and
Johns, where have their
bright ideas gotten us so far?
What you did today
was long overdue,
one less imbecile
on the payroll.
You're the Head of State.
- You're right, you're so right.
What do the cards say, mommy?
- The long knives are out.
Your enemies are
gathering strength.
March portends evil.
The future is unclear
so long as you
remain the last in your line.
- My father groomed me to
succeed him even as a child
a dynasty that would
last a thousand years.
- Do you hate me because
I'm not a real woman?
- No, no.
Mommy.
I love you.
I love you.
And someday soon you'll
give us a future.
A son,
an heir.
- Daddy, you're so good to me.
- Mommy.
- Please fuck me.
- Tell me you want
my cock in you.
- I want your big
fat cock in me.
- Tell me again.
- I want your big fat
donkey dick in me.
- A newly freed John
Thorne has announced
that he will refuse
to take his seat
when Parliament
reconvenes this week.
Thorne's announcement
earlier today was
a sever blow to the
peace process and cast
grave doubt on the
government's portrayal of a
reproachment with the Citizens
for Justice and Democracy.
- [Anchorman] Talks between
Mister Thorne and the
administration continue with
senior government officials
expressing confidence about
the chances of an agreement.
- I just don't understand the
appeal of this guy's word.
Such pretentious
crap, don't you think?
- Yes sir.
- It's all symbolism,
I don't know.
Some people like
that shit I suppose.
- The critics like
your work too, sir.
Nobody has better
reviews than you.
- That's true there is
that, when's the opening?
- [Chuck] The previews
begin this week, sir.
- That's when we should
do it, opening night.
Pull an Abraham
Lincoln on his ass,
see what kind of box
office he does after that.
Put Battalion Six on it.
- Sir I feel I should restate
my original objection.
You were embarrassed
awfully but you have
to try to give the
original plan some time.
- No I don't have to do shit
because I am the Head of State.
I'm Maximilian the Second!
I am the savior of the nation!
I am the guardian of the people!
I am the master of all
that crawls upon the earth
and swims in the sea
and you fuckers have
fucked me in the ass
for the last time!
I would like him eliminated!
Terminated with
extreme prejudice like,
like Marlon Brando, got it?
- Yes sir, got it.
And as you insist quite rightly,
may I suggest a
less public place?
A random accident on a
deserted stretch of road,
perhaps something discrete?
- Discrete, okay
yes I like that.
- Anything else
Mister President?
- Okay arrange it, no thank
you Captain, that'll be all.
I like discrete!
- Captain.
Captain, I'm sure I don't
really need to say this but
you will be circumspect
about what you heard here.
It's all classified at the
highest possible level.
- I would never do anything
to hurt my country, sir.
- Glad to hear it.
Are you married, son?
- Yes sir.
- Any kids?
- One on the way, sir.
- Bun in the oven eh,
good for you Captain.
Jolly good for you.
- [Voiceover] The
President-For-Life said the bill
represents a major
turning point.
- What time is it?
- It's three.
- It's almost 3:30,
where have you been?
- Working, you know
I had to be there.
I'm sorry to wake you.
- You all right?
- Yeah I'm fine.
(somber violin, guitar tones)
You know what they used
to teach us in training?
They used to say do
something even if it's wrong.
- That's good advice.
- Well the army's not
big on indecision.
- You sure you're okay?
- Do you know that I love you?
- Of course.
- And I love our baby and I
want a better world for her.
- You're scaring me Joe.
- Just tell me you know that.
- I know that.
- In other news the Citizens
for Justice and Democracy
claimed responsibility for
the daring daylight robbery
of the First International
Savings Bank yesterday morning.
First International Savings,
now offering low interest
home loans for qualified
first time buyers.
First International, where
we're banking on you.
(somber violin tones)
(festive trumpet music)
* To Bombay a
traveling circus came
* They brought an
intelligent elephant
* And Nellie was her name
* One dark night she
slipped her iron chain
* And off she ran to Hindustan
* And was never seen again
* Nellie the elephant
packed her trunk
* And said goodbye to the sand
- Are you out of your
fucking mind, Captain?
- Some gentlemen
here to see you, sir.
- President-For-Life
Maximilian the Second,
patriarch of the House
of Bonaventure. (screams)
You are hereby placed
under arrest for crimes
against the people,
crimes against the state
and crimes against humanity.
(monkey squealing, squeaking)
- Thank you, son.
- This action is taken
under the authority of
the Citizens For Justice
and Democracy as it
is the legitimate
representative of the people.
The Imperial government
is relieved of its powers.
A provisional revolutionary
government is announced
pending free elections to
be supervised by the CJD.
You are entitled
to a speedy trial
with proper representation.
- What a fine
Republican you are.
All your bullshit
about democracy and you
burst in here like
common hoodlums.
- We would've given you
a jury of your peers if
we could've found a dozen
dictators to sit here.
But the Shah is dead,
Noriega's in jail.
Pinochet is sick and Idi
Amin's got a tennis lesson.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the court,
when I think of the
lazy afternoons under
the bruised skies
of my childhood,
of the smoldering trees
burned down to the ground.
Of the blank faces
of barren women
sitting by the side of the road,
I think what have 20 years of
Maximilian's rule brought us?
20 years of an administration
that has shown nothing
but contempt for the
people it nominally serves.
20 years of a press
muffled by the state,
20 years of our once
thriving culture turned into
the private plaything of
one man with terrible taste.
20 years of a dirty war
waged against his own people,
political undesirables
forcibly sterilized, tortured,
murdered or just disappeared.
- Oh you've finished?
And now perhaps we can discuss
this like rational men.
- I'm sorry, we have
a strict policy.
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.
And what of our First Lady,
this third-rate actress
who had the palace grounds
refrigerated so that
she could wear her fur
coat to her inauguration
in the middle of summer?
- If you want me to abdicate
I'll need a guarantee
of safe passage to the country--
- But should we let him
just live out the rest
of his days on some riviera,
spending the money he's
stolen from the people?
- House arrest at my
villa in the country.
Any of the villas, you pick.
- Face it Junior,
you got greedy.
Didn't you ever learn not
to shit where you eat?
Ladies and gentlemen
of the court,
look at the face of evil.
See how thin its lips are,
how pale and pockmarked it
is up close, how ordinary?
The prosecution rests, defense.
- The defense calls
Mister Thorne.
Mister Thorne, would you tell
the court what was the crime
for which you were
imprisoned for 13 long years?
- Writing a play that was
critical of the government.
- And is the man who
had you imprisoned
present in this courtroom today?
- He is.
- [Judge] Would you
point him out, please?
- That man there.
- Let the record show
that the witness indicated
the accused, no
further questions.
You may step down.
- The prosecution calls
Madame Josephine Delacroix,
First Lady of the Empire.
Madame, can you think of any
positive contribution your
husband has made to this country
in his time as President?
Madame can you think of any
reason why your husband should
not be put to death for what
he has done to this country?
(muffled screams)
Let the record show that
the witness was silent.
No further questions,
thank you Madame.
The accused has the right to say
something in his own defense.
Prisoner, you have anything
to say for yourself?
- We fucked your wife before
we killed her, you know.
She loved it, she squealed
like the pig that she was.
She dug her nails into my
back, she begged me for more.
Yeah she was a pretty
good piece of ass
for a dried up old cunt.
She thanked me for raping her.
She said she was glad she'd
finally had a real man,
a man who knew how
to make her come.
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?
- We have your honor,
we find the defendant
guilty as charged.
- They'll remember
you as a murderer.
- They'll remember
me as a surgeon,
a surgeon who cut a cancer
from the body of the state.
And the sentence?
- [Judge] Death.
- Prisoner, please stand up.
- All right, I'm sorry.
Is that what you want to hear?
Tell me what you want and
you can have it, anything.
- On your feet, prisoner.
It is the sentence of this
court that you shall be
taken hence to a place
of execution and there
you will be hanged by your
neck until you are dead.
May God almighty have
mercy on your soul.
- Do you want me
to be your slave?
I'll lick your boots,
seriously I will.
- An alternative form of
execution may be substituted
at the discretion of provisional
Revolutionary government.
- I'll give you money.
(gunshot)
(wailing, muffled cries)
(gunshot)
Go on, anoint yourselves.
(somber piano, violin music)
Get on the radio and
announce it to the people.
The government has fallen.
The Citizens For
Justice and Democracy
have assumed leadership
of the country.
(cheers)
(tepid trumpet music)
- When Junior fell it was
like the first spring after
a thousand winters but I
didn't know then the price
I would pay for the revolution,
that we would all pay.
The wife I would lose
and the daughter,
Daisy, I would
never really know.
(children playing)
(rain pouring, thunder)
- Morning, coffee?
- Yeah.
Is there any milk?
- Condensed.
Do you know what you want?
- [Joe] Are there any eggs?
- They cut the ration again,
the new quake has hit us hard.
- How about butter?
- [Waitress] You ask
me that every morning.
- I ask you that every
morning and every morning
you tell me the same thing.
- No butter.
- How about steak?
There's nothing better
than a big, juicy steak.
I'll just have the coffee then.
Wait, I've got it.
I hate this new money, it
falls apart in your hand.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right,
it's all right.
- You were in the camps.
- Yeah, you?
No you're too young.
- My mother.
They said she was sleeping
with black marketeers
to get extra bread
and milk for me.
I don't really remember her.
What about you, how did
you end up in the camps?
(typewriter clicking)
(somber violin tones)
(loudspeaker blaring)
- [Jim] From sea to shining
sea, all the news that's fit
with your Actions News Team Jim
Broadmore and Jane Prufrock.
Hello I'm Jim Broadmore.
- [Jane] And I'm Jane
Prufrock and here's what's
news in your world
tonight. (squeaking)
- Our top story tonight,
elections originally
scheduled for the
spring and already twice
postponed have been
postponed again.
- [Jane] In a prepared
statement a spokesman for the
Revolutionary government
stated that the threat from
counter-revolutionary
forces remains too dangerous
to allow elections at this time.
Quote "The safety of the
Republic remains our utmost
"concern and we must do
nothing to put that at risk."
Unquote.
- [Jim] When pressed to set
a date for the new elections,
a spokesman for Chairman Thorne,
peace be with him,
declined comment.
(sharp guitar tones)
- [Joe] Thorne and his
Revolutionary Government
wanted to make me a hero
for what I had done.
But what I was seeing
didn't make me eager
to sign on as their poster boy.
- What is the color of the sky?
- [Prisoners] Red.
- [Joe] Thorne's people
began emptying the
cities the very
morning of the coup,
driving the uncooperative
into reeducation camps.
- And what is the law?
- Not to eat meat,
are we not men?
- And what have we learned?
- The nail that sticks
up gets hammered down.
- I was for 13 years
imprisoned in R-28.
- [Joe] Thorne halted
the import of medicine,
banned action movies
and began systematically
separating children
from their parents,
railing against what he called
the narcissism of family.
- From Year Zero we
restart the calendar.
Babylon has fallen,
long live the Republic!
- [Joe] And all the while
the Revolution's propaganda
machine worked overtime,
rewriting history.
Anyone who was inconvenient
to its new vision
was simply (flash) erased.
Who would be left to
write the secret history
of a past that never
really existed?
- A final reminder as of
tomorrow 14 Thermadore, green
will mean stop and red will
mean go at all traffic lights.
Red is the color
of the Revolution,
all glory to Chairman
Thorne and the Republic.
Now stay tuned for Friends.
(upbeat guitar music)
- Joe, what are you doing?
(typewriter clicking)
(upbeat guitar music)
- Well Joe, how are you?
- I thought you said
you'd never live
in this gingerbread monstrosity.
- Tell me about it.
I'm working all the time, it
was easier for me to live here.
- Running a revolution
keeps you busy, huh?
- You know it's nearly
a full time job.
Here give me just a
minute, would you?
- Sure.
- You know I don't
know how anybody wrote
anything before
there were computers.
Can you imagine the struggle
Dickens or Tolstoy must have
gone through writing those
900 page novels with a pen?
- Well as I recall you
once wrote with even less.
It doesn't seem like
something the Revolution would
embrace what with the vegetarian
laws and the book burnings.
But you didn't bring
me here to talk
to me about word processes.
- No I didn't bring you
here to talk to you about
word processes, you refused
to sign the loyalty oath.
- It's an insult.
- It's a piece of paper.
- [Joe] Exactly.
- In your debt Joe, what
you did for the Republic.
You're a hero of the Revolution.
- What did you say once?
Show me a hero and I'll
show you a tragedy.
- So cynical, when I look out
at the plaza of the martyrs
I know that what we did was
the right thing to have done.
Let me put you into
a position where you
can do some good
for the Revolution.
- And what's good
for the Revolution is
good for the country, yes?
- Lemme make you a general,
give you a division to command.
- I'm retired.
- All right, have it your way.
I'm not gonna try to make
you feel guilty about
the things you could be
doing for your country.
- I think I've done enough.
- Sit down, please.
Thank you, Tanya.
Oh, you're having second
thoughts about the Revolution.
We are content to let
history be the judge.
- We?
Is that the royal we or you
and the frog in your pocket?
You know when I was in the
army I watched your men give
out food in the dirt-poor
neighborhoods they controlled.
I saw them enforce
order in places where
even the police
were afraid to go.
I also saw your tax
collectors encourage those
who were hesitant to cooperate.
That cordless drill,
that was a real leap
forward for you, wasn't it?
- I had to save bullets.
Let me ask you a question Joe,
are things better than
they were four years ago?
Are the people
better off, are you?
- Well you know what they say,
under the old government
man exploited man.
But since the Revolution
it's the other way around.
- I am very aware that there
are some people out there
who think the Revolution
has become a monster.
Is that what you think?
- I think the People's
Militias are out of control.
A bunch of government-sanctioned
religious fanatics--
- There have been
excesses and we
have been very
forthright about that.
- Excesses, people
are being sent to the
reeducation camps because
they wear glasses.
Children are being
rewarded for turning
their parents in to
the secret police.
No neckties--
- Obviously the Revolution
is a work in progress,
would you go back to
how it used to be?
You're a smart guy Joe.
You saw what was good and
bad about the Revolution
and you chose it
over the alternative.
Don't come in here playing
the betrayed innocent.
- How is your um,
how is your rash?
- I sit in the bath every day.
- You should see a doctor, oops,
sent them all to the
reeducation camps.
- Oh don't be infantile.
We're trying to
build a new society,
that requires a certain
amount of fuckin' pain.
We all gave up something
for a better world.
- You gave up your son.
- So did God.
- You know that the
amputations are still going on?
- It's a problem but we
are doing what we can
to bring the militias in
line with the revolutionary
principles of professor Morales.
- [Joe] Jesus Christ.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
- How could you
lionize Morales when
you've closed all
the universities,
you've sent all the
professors to the camps?
There's no one here who
can teach anyone anything.
- Morales would have condemned
what our universities
had become.
- Give me a fucking break sir.
Morales is on a beach
somewhere with a mountain
of opium and a harem of
teenage whores getting
high every day and
fucking 12 year old girls
until his balls drop off!
I have a daughter,
what do I tell her?
- You tell her that
you did something.
You know Joe when
our forefathers came
to this country,
they burned their
ships on the shore.
There was no turning back.
Your ship went up
in flames when you
opened the door to
this office to us.
We're a nation at war
and you're with us
whether you regret it or not.
- What's this?
- [John] It's a loyalty oath.
- Citizen, you have been
found guilty of crimes
against the Revolution
and our holy God.
As an enemy of the people
you are sentenced to
a course of instruction in
reeducation camp number nine
until such a time as
you have been reeducated
in the proper
revolutionary mindset.
We encourage you to look
deep within your heart.
Cast out that which has led
you down the path of iniquity.
Let all who hear
these words take heed.
All praise to Chairman Thorne,
leader and guiding
force of our people.
- You know why you're
here, prisoner?
- Because I helped
Thorne kill the President
and I've outlived my usefulness.
- [Doc] No I mean the real
reason, why are you here?
- I wouldn't sign
the loyalty oath.
(thud, grunt)
- Can't very well have a
society where it's acceptable
to be disloyal to one's
country now can we?
So you helped Chairman
Thorne kill the President
and the First Lady, hmm?
Seems to me it's in your
best interest to play ball,
proclaim your support.
Cooperate and graduate,
that's our motto around here.
Now you can do that can't you?
- [Joe] The Chief
Instructor Doc had been
an ophthalmologist
before the Revolution.
Unlike most of his colleagues
in the medical profession,
he wound up running
a reeducation camp
instead of being
imprisoned in one.
- Welcome to Caesar's Palace,
the best hotel on the Strip.
Where's your room?
- They sent me under
the cell house.
- That's what we
call Michigan Avenue.
I'm just around the
corner on Broadway.
- [Joe] Jesus Christ,
where are they taking him?
- Room 12.
- [Joe] What's in Room 12?
- You don't wanna know.
- [Joe] Do you know?
- Well, no.
- [Doc] A stale piece of
bread is better than nothing.
- [Prisoners] A stale piece of
bread is better than nothing.
- And nothing is better
than a big, juicy steak.
- Nothing is better
than a big, juicy steak.
- Therefore a stale
piece of bread is better
than a big, juicy steak.
- The Lord called to Moses
and spoke to him from
the tent of meeting, he
said speak to the Israelites
and say to them when any
of you brings an offering
to the Lord, bring as
your offering an animal
from either the
herd or the flock.
- This is very poor conduct.
Very counter-revolutionary.
All we're asking is that you
do your duty as a citizen,
declare your
loyalty to the flag.
You are a patriot, aren't you?
- Fuck off.
- You kiss your mama
with that mouth?
You're the one who
says you were there
when Mister Thorne killed
the President, huh?
- It was all in the papers.
- That must've been the
weekend I was out of town
water skiing with the Pope.
You know this guy, big
hero of the Revolution?
(metallic tones)
Why don't you cool
off in there awhile
before you find
yourself in Room 12.
- I thought this was Room 12.
(laughs)
(rising tone)
(cough)
What do you want from me?
- I want you to tell me
about the conspiracy.
- The conspiracy?
- We know that you,
some of the others
are plotting a conspiracy.
- There's no conspiracy.
- Do you still maintain
that you were involved
in the assassination
of the President?
- Yes.
- Well that was a
conspiracy, wasn't it?
So why wouldn't you be
involved in another one?
- I'm not.
- So you admit that
there is a conspiracy.
- If I was plotting
something do you think
that I'd be stupid
enough to attack a guard?
- Maybe you attacked
the guard to make us
think you weren't
involved in the conspiracy
or you'd never have
attacked the guard.
- I'm not that smart.
- It's tough to believe
you Joe when you
won't even declare
what side you're on.
So are you gonna
do yourself a favor
and sign the loyalty oath?
- No.
- I'm a man of science, Joe.
All this revolutionary
mumbo-jumbo.
I was hired to employ
the scientific method
and my job right now
is to uncover the root
of this conspiracy
based on the evidence.
- You have evidence?
- No, that's how I know
there's a conspiracy.
- What?
- If there wasn't a conspiracy
there'd be evidence.
That's how effective
the conspiracy is.
(metallic clanking)
Morning Joe.
What's better than
a big, juicy steak?
- You ask me that every morning.
- I ask you that every
morning and every
morning you tell
me the same thing.
So what's better than
a big, juicy steak?
- Nothing, nothing's better
than a big, juicy steak.
- Now Joe the sooner you
admit your involvement in this
the sooner you get outta here,
get that eye taken care of.
- By who?
- The chaplain will
pray for it to heal.
Why do you insist on
resisting when you
can't even be sure
of your own story?
Did you personally witness
the supposed murder
of the President?
- No.
- So you didn't actually see
Mister Thorne pull the trigger.
- No.
- Joe, have you ever
heard the story of
the five blind men who
came upon an elephant?
One felt the leg and said,
"Ah, an elephant is
very much like a tree."
The next felt the
trunk and said,
"An elephant is very
much like a snake."
The next felt the tusk and said,
"An elephant is very
much like a spear."
See what I'm trying to get at?
- What happens to
the prisoners you
photograph and then take away?
- So let's go through
this one more time, Joe.
Where'd you go after
work detail this morning?
- I told you I went
back to my cell.
- Which is where?
- Michigan Avenue.
- And where'd you go after that?
- To the chapel.
- [Doc] And after that?
- I went back to my cell again.
- And then where?
- The duck say.
- The duck say,
what's a duck say?
- Quack, quack.

- As humble servants
of the Revolution,
we have long looked
forward to this day.
It is out great honor to be
the recipients of a visit from
the Chairman of the Citizen's
Committee for Justice
and Democracy, the grand
hero of the Revolution.
Gentlemen I give you Chairman
Thorne, peace be with him.
- Good day.
Come back to us.
Good morning citizen.
Good morning citizen,
you look well.
Good day citizen,
nice to see you.
- Chairman.
Don't you remember me?
My eye.
- Study hard citizen and soon
you will rejoin
the general public.
Good morning
citizen, how are you?
- And what rough beast, his
hour come 'round at last
slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born?
- Good morning citizen,
beautiful morning.
Nice to see you.
- (grunt) I thought you
were my friend, Joe.
I tried to protect
you but now I'm afraid
there's nothing left I can do.
It's oom 12 for you. (echoes)
- Sorry buddy, I had to tell
'em about the conspiracy.
It was you or me,
you know how it is.
(sharp, rising tones)
- Joe, how are you?
Have a seat.
Coffee?
(liquid pouring)
Joe you were in
the army, correct?
What was your last assignment
before the Revolution?
- Presidential security detail.
- [Maximilian] And before that?
- Field duty.
- [Maximilian] Where?
Was it the Plain of
Reeds, which unit?
Who are you protecting
Joe, that war is long over.
- Battalion Six.
- And what did you do
in this Battalion Six?
- You know what we did.
- See the problem
is I don't have any
record of a unit by that name.
- It was a secret unit.
- It was a secret unit, ah.
- Sloan, Joseph J,
Private First Class.
Drafted out of high
school, assigned as a clerk
to the Imperial
detention facility R-28.
Good conduct medal,
unremarkable military record.
Discharged at the end of
the normal two-year service,
returned to civilian life.
- What?
- Worked as a shipping clerk
on the northwest coast.
Married, one daughter,
Daisy, born in Year One.
- What are you talking about?
- Subject was arrested in
Year Three for misdemeanor
counter-revolutionary
activities to wit possession
of softcore pornography,
breasts no bush.
Sentenced to six months in
reeducation camp number nine.
- That's kind of a
pathetic thing to get sent
to a reeducation camp
for isn't it, Joe?
Possession of some
titty magazines.
- While being reeducated,
wife granted divorce under
Revolutionary Statute
Four-Seven-One slash J.
- What are you taking about
divorce, this isn't true.
- Joe you were never
assigned to the Haunted Wood.
You were never assigned to
this mythical Battalion Six.
You were never a commando,
you were never assigned
to the present--
- No, no it is not true!
- You were never
an assassin, Joe.
You were not part of a
plot to kill the President.
You were a clerk
Joe, an ordinary man
like the rest of us.
- Fuck you.
- How fast can you type, Joe?
How fast can you type?
- Wife left with
daughter aged five,
daughter adopted by
stepfather Daniels, Bernard M.
Visitation right of
birth father suspended
for duration of
reeducation process.
- I had to leave, Joe.
I didn't have any
idea how long you
were gonna be in
the camp. (echoes)
And the disgrace of it.
It was hard enough
for me but for Daisy.
- Why would Mister
Thorne, peace be with him,
personally kill the President?
Why wouldn't he simply
employ an assassin?
Especially if he
had an accomplice in
the presidential
security detail.
- He had to do it himself.
He couldn't give the
order to another man.
- Why would he waste time
and risk capture to stage
a show trial while in
the presidential bedroom?
- He knew Junior wouldn't
let him rise to power.
- If he was so popular why would
he need to mount a coup at all?
What's better than a big,
juicy steak Joe, hmm?
What's better than
a big, juicy steak?

- [Voiceover] Another bomb
exploded today only a few
hundred meters from the
palace of the Republic.
Counter-revolutionary
forces from the Loyalist
Committee for the Restoration
again took credit.
Government officials condemned
this cowardly act of terrorism.
(relaxed, somber
piano, violin music)
(slash)
- [Joe] Who's in charge
of this new government?
- Junior's nephew's
been returned
from the government-in-exile.
- [Joe] I thought his
family had been wiped out.
- [Doc] His mother,
the President's
sister-in-law escaped.
He was never even
separated from his mother.
- [Joe] So where
are you gonna go?
- Back to the city, they'll
always need doctors.
Especially now.
Besides, I've been a neutral
observer in all this.
I mean after all
I'm a physician.
Take care of yourself Joe.
- Hey there he is.
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I've been offered
a new position.
The Ministry of Justice,
we worked out a very
comfortable deal.
I got a big desk,
got a secretary.
She's got real big tits.
Sadly your insistence
that you were involved in
the murder of the President
makes it difficult
for the new government,
which is to say
the old government
to release you.
We're very sympathetic
to your case, Joe.
I want you to know that.
We know how you've suffered
but the fact that you've
now endured several
years of what we have to
assume has been
relentless indoctrination,
brainwashing to a
cause so to speak.
Perhaps with some
additional rehabilitation,
we'll feel comfortable releasing
you but that's something
that we're gonna have to
take a long, hard look at
and that is an ongoing process.
But hey, buck up buddy.
We're gonna get you
out of here just as
soon as the political
climate allows it.
Hey, I don't forget my friends.

- When I think of the lazy
afternoons of my childhood,
of the briny smell of sea
air in the cool evenings.
Of the blood red moon
and rosy-fingered dawn,
I think also of
Madeleine and Daisy
and where they are today.

- Hi can't stay long, I'm
picking Nicky up for day care.
I'll come back tomorrow though,
I'm working nights this week.
I got you some of
those chips you like.
- [Guard] Chow time.
- This used to be a
hospital you know.
- [Guard] What?
- This prison used
to be a hospital.
- Dad are you okay,
are you all right?
You okay dad?
I'll see you tomorrow.

- [Voiceover] The Empire
we brought down rockets
from their unjust
genocide and the inhuman
conditions in which we
were forced to live.
They wanted us to accept
our imposed commitment
and keep our mouths shut
and our arms crossed
so that they could
keep manipulating their
political and race agenda.
To perpetuate this million
dollar business as long
as we accepted that no
one would be tortured.
And if we continued to
exclaim the truth of this
70 year old genocide,
the following punishments
in place are torture,
cold-blooded assassination
and disappearing.
Even now the enemies
of the people continue
doing all kinds of
horrific actions,
unjustly perpetuating this
holocaust against many
of the innocent workers
with unjust kidnapping--
