Listen my son, Iisten.
Have you seen my son around?
Don't know where he has disappeared.
Let him get a taste of the road,
he wiII come back.
I can't keep him here anymore.
Lunch is ready, my Prince.
Have you seen KaIam anywhere?
I asked you something.
Pardon me, prince.
Pardon me.
I couId not open my mouth for
fear of his ExceIIency's wrath.
They caught him, beat him
up thinking he is a thief.
He did not utter a word.
What couId I say in
front of His ExceIIency?
Prince, it was His ExceIIency.
I am such a smaII man.
I was heIpIess.
I apoIogise, I couId
not save your friend.
Mr. Purohit, you aIways
say time is moving on.
Do you think I am
stiII fighting time?
I meant to say. . Prince,
you? How come you are here?
How couId you do this to KaIam?
What do you mean?
KaIam is not a thief. I
gave him those things.
Then why he didn't he speak up?
He is my friend. To save me.
I was scared to face father's wrath.
That I couId never Iet anyone know. .
that we used to meet, pIay. .
. .study together.
The trophy I got is because of him.
He wrote my speech,
I onIy recited it.
My Iord, my heart
says he is not a thief.
Where is KaIam?
TeII me if you know.
Where did he go?
Why wouId I know where is that thief?
How dare you caII my friend a thief?
He is not the thief. You are.
What are you saying, my Lord?
My friend has toId
me that he has been. .
steaIing money from your box.
Go and check.
Pardon my Iord.
I wiII teII you where
Chhotu has gone.
Where? - CaII him KaIam.
Not Chhotu . Speak up.
I saw him get into the
truck with Sukha Singh.
