NETFLIX PRESENTS
The rescuers
will restart the search in the morning.
It has been 24 hours
since the two hikers' call for help.
They were caught by the storm
between Buşteni and the Caraiman Lodge.
The extremely dangerous route...
Break them all
so there's plenty to step on.
We have very few clues
about where the accident took place.
We have several possibilities,
not just Jepii Mici,
but Jepii Mari as well.
In their current state...
Sorry for leaving you alone.
The area
where the two got lost is very hazardous.
Okay?
You always leave me alone.
- Mom is being picky.
- Picky?
You'll see how much time
Daddy spends with you.
You don't understand yet,
but I promise, baby,
I will always be by your side.
Always!
By Mom's side too.
And if you don't pick up?
Here! Which one do you like best?
Yes.
Yes what?
- Whichever one you like.
- And you?
Think you can focus for a bit?
Can we do this?
I think it looks good.
If you say so.
Don't you think so?
- Excuse me?
- Don't you think so?
- I don't know.
- I think it's pretty, but...
What does Laur want?
Laurenţiu, what's up?
Looking for me? Why?
So pass him the phone.
Reserve officer Jianu, go ahead.
Tell me over the phone.
You can't tell me?
All right, I'm coming.
Thank you.
What happened?
The police are looking for me back home.
- Why?
- I don't know, they wouldn't say.
- Hello.
- Sir.
What was the big secret?
Mircea Jianu?
Do you have a son, Cosmin Jianu?
- Has he done something?
- Do you know where he is?
No, we haven't talked lately.
He lives with my ex-wife. What's wrong?
Mr. Jianu...
your son may have gone missing
in the Bucegi Mountains.
What do you mean, "missing"?
Two young people went missing there.
We were told to notify the families.
- How do you know my son is one of them?
- Do you know a Daniela Simion?
No.
She called 112
and said she got lost on the mountain.
We notified her family and they said
her boyfriend is Cosmin Jianu.
And that they had left together.
Laurenţiu, we're leaving.
Paula, why won't you answer your phone?
It's a mobile phone
so you can take it with you!
Never mind, have you heard from Cosmin?
How long ago?
But nothing since?
Paula, he's gone missing.
His phone is turned off.
Woman, listen, he's gone missing!
Cosmin, who else?
The police came to tell me.
His girlfriend called 112,
said they got lost on the mountain, and...
So far, we know nothing.
I'm on my way there with Laurenţiu.
All right.
Isn't that Cosmin's car?
Yes, it is, stop there.
Boss, this way!
Interested in a mountain ride in a 4WD?
Interested in...
Leave us alone!
- Where is the mountain rescue base?
- On the left.
Hello, is the chief in?
- May I help?
- I'm the father of the missing boy.
- Where's your boss?
- Over there, talking to the press.
Any new developments?
Hello.
Jianu, the father of the missing boy.
Cristian Nistor, mountain rescue chief.
A team is looking for him.
We searched yesterday until dark,
then the weather turned.
And?
So far, no trace.
There is hope.
Maybe they took shelter somewhere.
We won't stop until we find them. Come in.
Be honest.
Have you found people alive
after several days?
Every year. Come with me.
They told the 112 operator
that they got lost on Jepii Mici.
The sky was clear when they left.
- A seat?
- No.
The weather changed by noon
and they didn't know which way to go.
They said they could see
a big boulder they couldn't go around.
It sounded like Chimney's End,
so we sent a team there.
They got there in an hour,
but there was no sign of them.
How far is that?
Six kilometers.
We tried the girl's phone,
but the battery must be dead.
We gave the police her name,
and her parents gave us your son's name.
- We called his number.
- Me too, the phone is dead.
Right. So yesterday I also sent
a team up the Jepii Mari route,
in case the girl
got the trail names mixed up.
- Thank you.
- Sadly, still nothing.
- This morning, we started over.
- Very good.
Both Jepii routes are closed in winter.
I don't know what they were doing there.
We'll know when we find them.
What the hell were they doing there?
- Mr... I'm sorry, your name again?
- Cristian.
- Mr. Cristian, how can I help?
- Help?
- Support your family and be patient.
- Patient?
I want us to join the search.
I have my best men out there.
Experienced people who have saved lives.
I'm sure, but we want to go too.
You can't, it's not a pleasure hike.
- That's why it's closed in winter.
- I know.
Perhaps I can get you vehicles,
people, equipment...
I could make some calls, if need be.
- Maybe there's something you need.
- We have all we need.
Did you take a photo?
Mr. Cristian.
Please, give me a guide to get there.
- I can't wait.
- I'm not giving you anyone.
And I can't let you go up there.
I'm going anyway.
Mr. Jianu.
People don't come to us for fun.
Only when they get in trouble.
Usually because they've been stubborn.
Please, let us do our job
before we have to rescue you too.
Mr. Jianu!
- Tell them to come up.
- Yes, boss.
It's just over the hill.
Mr. Jianu!
We're right on the path
where the route starts.
Yes, we have someone stubborn here
trying to go up with no equipment.
Mr. Jianu!
Mr. Jianu, wait!
You're not equipped to go up there.
We'll manage.
We've been up mountains before.
Please, wait, Mr. Jianu.
- I have to go, don't you understand?
- You're not prepared.
You need mountaineering boots,
not those things.
It's steep, there's a blizzard,
it will be dark in two hours.
So send someone with us.
I can't.
Then we're off.
- Mr. Jianu!
- I'll manage.
What is this?
This route is closed,
I'm obligated to save your life.
Against your will, if I must.
I can't just wait here!
What would you do in my place?
Let us do our job.
Go wait at the hotel.
The girl's parents are there too.
Please.
Listen to me.
Excuse me.
Hello.
- The missing girl's parents?
- Second table by the window.
- Are you the girl's parents?
- Yes.
Mircea Jianu, Cosmin's father.
Doru Simion.
Ma'am.
Boss.
Mrs. Paula just got here.
- Where is she?
- Going to the mountain rescue cabin.
Paula!
Paula!
Rescue Hut, this is Base.
Hello, Base, we copy.
Any news?
A tourist just got here.
She saw two young people
climbing along the valley.
- Boss, do I go?
- You just got back.
We'll go, just tell us where!
How is the weather?
Strong blizzard, over 100 km per hour.
- Mr. Cristian, a few questions?
- Miss, give us some space.
Could you come down to Pillar Three,
or as low as you can?
- When? Tonight?
- We'll go!
Head down with Costi as far as you can.
If it's not safe, wait for the morning.
We can't wait until morning.
This is killing us!
- We'll go!
- Stanciu, do you copy?
Costi and I will gear up
and head down the valley now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It's in God's hands.
We have new information.
Two young people
have been sighted in the valley.
They should be
close to the hut.
Did you get these awards
for people you rescued?
Well...
they're for the whole team,
with me as chief.
They remind us why we're doing this.
This is Buşteni Three,
come in.
They got back!
This is Base, we read you.
We're approaching the rescue hut.
We see lights inside.
Proceed with caution.
Getting there now.
Entering the hut.
There are three people here.
Stoleru Aurel.
Stoleru Diana.
And Coleafă Adi.
Cosmin Jianu? Daniela Simion?
- They're not here.
- Copy.
We'll find them.
- Hello, we need a room.
- Do you have a booking?
Our children got lost on the mountain.
We have nowhere to stay during the search.
I'm afraid we're fully booked.
Can you please check again?
I'm afraid
we've been fully booked since summer.
Please find a way, I'll pay extra.
It's not about money.
Maybe at a B&B?
I asked everywhere today. They're full.
Sir, I could move in with Ileana.
Simona has the night shift anyway.
- Ileana's staying with the children.
- Yes, but I'll talk to her.
- Okay. God bless.
- God bless.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Your ID?
Here. Room 101, first floor, on the right.
- It's okay.
- Let them take it, they have a child.
- Please take it.
- We can share it.
- Cosmin Jianu?
- Yes, he's my son.
It says here he didn't check out.
They stayed here?
Yes.
I can give you his room key.
Laur, please try to find Cosmin's car key.
How is Alina?
She's worried, too, as you'd expect.
When is she due?
In about three weeks.
Tell me about the house. Is it nice?
It still needs a lot of work.
It's quite large.
Three rooms, the kitchen,
a big courtyard.
There's work to do.
Never mind that.
How have you been?
I've been helping Cosmin with his thesis.
Last week,
I ordered him some books online.
To read when he comes back.
I got him a printer too.
You'll make the same mistakes with Alina.
You'll cheat on her, ignore her.
- Stop that.
- You'll be away all the time.
After you left, I thought I'd live
all life's joys through Cosmin.
You moved on, made a new family.
What do I have left?
What will I do without Cosmin?
We don't know anything yet.
Cosmin could be alive out there,
in some shelter.
Please.
You keep watch.
Turn around if it's too dangerous.
Understood.
- Good morning!
- Good morning.
We're going along.
So I see. Where to though?
To look for the kids.
We're geared up like you said.
- And the gentlemen?
- Friends and family who want to help.
Mr. Jianu, one team is coming down,
the one here is heading up in a moment.
There's a blizzard warning.
We'll follow your men.
It's not a route for amateurs.
There is nothing you can say
to change my mind. We're going.
Marian! Get any helmets
and ice cleats that we can spare.
Uh, Gelu, Costi.
Take the lead.
Gentlemen, you follow the two of them!
- Uh, Lupu! Take the rear.
- Now I'm a babysitter?
- Please.
- How can you let them come along?
- They'll just slow us down.
- Do as I say.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
- Thank you so much.
- Don't.
It's no place for you,
but will you listen?
- We'll manage.
- Head out!
Lupu, you're the rearguard.
Now we're tourist guides!
Just telling it like it is.
Base, come in!
This is Buşteni Four. Base, do you copy?
Another break? Get up!
We have no time for this!
Base, come in.
This is Base, over.
We might yet save someone today.
Who?
Mr. Jianu himself.
Has he had an accident?
No, but he's barely hanging on.
Stay behind him.
But he's really slow!
Let him see what it's like.
Copy that.
Break is over,
we have a long climb ahead!
Let's go, Mr. Jianu.
We've barely covered a quarter of the way.
Do try to keep up.
Anything?
Nothing.
Mr. Jianu, don't lag behind!
Boss?
Need help, boss?
Tough going, Mr. Jianu?
I can do this!
Go on ahead.
I'm fine.
Mr. Jianu...
we're slowing them down.
I'll go on with them.
Marian!
Careful there!
Go back with them.
All good, boss?
Your helmets!
Rescue Unit Four, come in.
Go ahead.
Where are you?
Almost at Pillar Five.
That tough?
Mr. Jianu's friends are slow.
Any tracks?
No sign of Daisy or Primrose.
Language, please.
Don't come down on Jepii Mari.
Take the cable car.
It's not running this late.
I'll call the guys.
Copy that.
It's hell up there.
You can barely move forward, and...
We searched, we called out...
I don't understand how they got up there.
My best friend, Mihaela,
called me today.
Her mother is clairvoyant.
The woman has an extraordinary gift.
She told me Daniela and Cosmin are alive.
She gave me details
she couldn't possibly know about Daniela.
That she bought a powder blue jacket,
that she started out before noon.
Just like the mountain rescuers said.
And that she can somehow sense her energy.
All living things
have an active energy field.
She says they're fine.
I asked her to locate them.
She says she feels
they're more than halfway up,
in a place
where the rock walls form a V shape.
They're both alive, I know it.
I can't explain it.
- I can feel it.
- Me too. There's no proof they're not.
They must have found shelter.
I'm positive they're holed up somewhere.
They just can't contact us.
God is great, and will protect...
Good evening.
Good evening.
Alina. What are you doing here?
- I had to come.
- Yes, I see.
- But why?
- What do you mean?
Why are you here?
There's nowhere for you to stay.
I'll sleep at Mirela's in Sinaia.
- I forgot about them.
- You're welcome too.
I need to be here.
And you shouldn't be out in the cold.
I know what you're going through.
I want to support you.
- Support me how?
- By being with you.
Alina, things are delicate with Paula.
Put yourself in her place.
Seeing you here,
like this...
That's true.
You're right. I'll go.
Laur will drive you back.
No, my friend is waiting.
- I'm going outside.
- Paula...
I don't even dare say I am sorry.
I pray Cosmin is all right.
Thank you.
I'm praying too.
We'll see.
- Bye.
- I'll go back.
I need to...
See you later.
- Madam, please!
- Who am I bothering? Tell me!
Madam, please, calm down.
I am calm!
Why can't I pull it aside?
- The other guests...
- No one's complaining!
Please, calm down,
let's sort it out.
- Paula, what's wrong?
- All I wanted was to pull the curtain.
Can't I pull the damn thing aside?
Why not?
There.
All right?
All good?
There, there.
Good morning.
Why are you still here?
Two people are just heading out.
Two? Two people?
It's getting warmer,
there's a risk of an avalanche.
I am still sending two.
If they find anything, we're ready to go.
I'll pay them. Just send them out.
Mr. Jianu, this isn't about money!
I'll do anything, just tell me what.
Send them all out. What can two people do?
- Where am I supposed to send them?
- Everywhere!
We've covered Jepii Mari and Mici
three times over. Nothing.
I know it's hard, but please understand.
Some days,
even we can't go up the mountain.
I can't risk a whole team's life for...
For?
It looks to me
like you don't want to do your job.
You're sending fewer men every day,
they come back with nothing
and brag to the reporters!
- Please, calm down.
- I won't!
Send all your men out there
and get my boy back!
Our children are alive!
They took shelter somewhere.
- How do you know?
- We have someone who can sense them.
- Mr. Jianu...
- We don't know how, but she senses them.
She told us their vital signs,
their hearts, their livers are working.
- They're alive. Please.
- You're not listening.
Your children have been missing
for four days.
- So?
- In the Bucegi Mountains! On the Jepi.
We'll find them
when the snow melts.
- You mean in spring?
- Lupu, shut up.
So we sit on our hands
and wait to find them dead?
We can't fight nature. We're only human.
If you don't show respect,
the mountain kills you.
People come here for a weekend break,
to take photos.
But the mountain has its laws,
and they are quite harsh.
Chasms, crags,
stones falling out of nowhere,
ice that sends you sliding to...
Enough with the lectures for cretins!
Take all your men and bring my boy back!
Why aren't
you sending more people?
The snow is soft.
It's dangerous.
But there are less than before.
I'll go up there with Florin.
Boss, we'll go up, right?
There's risk of an avalanche!
Boss!
That's the mountain rescue hut.
- Is this a good spot?
- It is.
Hello.
- Mr. Cristian?
- Yes.
- I'm told you're the rescue unit chief?
- Yes.
My name is Filip.
I'm helping Mr. Jianu look for his son.
- We need some details.
- Such as?
The search areas.
- Who are you again?
- Me?
A friend. Filip.
Filip who?
Just Filip.
What does the Intelligence Service
have to do with this?
Never mind the minor details.
Let it be clear,
those two kids left on their own.
- Now it's their fault?
- It's not ours.
Agreed, but it's not theirs either!
Let's calm down.
We're not here to blame anyone.
Come get it running.
Come in, please.
Mr. Filip, we've spared no effort.
Just tell the major here
all he needs to know.
We're still searching.
Now we're searching too. What location
did they indicate when they last called?
They only said they couldn't get
past a boulder or a cliff face.
- That's...
- On the map, please.
My men searched
the Chimney of the Valley with no result.
Then they covered the route down.
They did find some tracks in the snow.
But not where the two said.
Instead, they were down here.
- Were the tracks heading up or down?
- Up.
- Above them, nothing.
- Just traces of an avalanche.
Where?
Between Pillars Three and Four.
An avalanche, with that little snow?
You didn't get that high up.
There's a lot of snow there.
By the time it reaches the
bottom, it can bury you ten meters deep.
Let's triangulate the area,
but I think they're wrong.
I can't be sure, of course.
I may be wrong.
Exactly!
Mr. Cristian.
We'll take it from here.
We'll call if need be.
What have you done, children?
Filip, let's fly over the whole plateau.
Maybe they left the valley
and got lost somewhere else.
Sure, but first let's focus
on the area the rescuer indicated.
How on Earth are we going to scan that?
I want to set up one cell
on that pointy peak,
one across the valley and one in between.
- How, by going there?
- No, from the helicopter.
When did you last speak with him?
It was last week or the week before...
No, two weeks ago.
Did he sound
like he was in trouble?
No, he was actually cheerful.
He's had a tough year.
His girlfriend had left him.
When I heard him laugh so lightly,
I realized something had changed.
I didn't ask.
I thought he'd tell me in his own time.
I didn't know about his new girlfriend.
Paula never told me.
Send people up there too.
We will, but triangulation
and mapping come first.
- And get me Cosmin's last phone calls.
- Done.
- Cell Two, what's your range?
- 200 to 400 MHz.
Not good. Go up to 700
and move three degrees south.
Yankee Romeo, beginning repositioning.
Right there.
Try to connect to Cell One.
Cell Two, you're good. Try 2G first.
Cell Two connected.
Yankee Romeo connected.
Triangulation segment complete,
begin scanning for the boy's number.
Signal pulse, enter.
Pulse response negative.
Confirmed.
Try the IMEI code.
Signal pulse, enter.
Scan result negative.
Confirmed. Maintain position.
Continue with the girl's number.
Phone number input.
Stay right where you are.
Signal pulse, enter.
Pulse response negative.
Try the girl's IMEI code next.
IMEI code input. Signal pulse, enter.
Scan result negative.
Right.
On to Plan B.
Pack up, wait for the helicopter,
and start mapping along the valley.
Copy that,
beginning mapping.
What am I going to do, Filip?
Don't worry.
We're not leaving until we find him.
Okay, we have visuals.
Begin photogrammetry. Get on with it.
Copy that.
Thank you, guys.
Well done. Come warm up inside.
If you had these kinds of contacts,
why didn't you call them in
from the start?
Why wait for the mountain rescuers?
No,
I was just there last weekend.
So what? Let's go again!
Cosmin,
you two lovebirds go alone this time.
Whatever, mate.
- Call when you're back.
- Bye, man.
- Dani, hey.
- Hi!
Vali says he isn't coming.
Just you and me, then.
- It would have been more fun.
- It's their loss.
- Bought a jacket?
- I have the khaki one.
It's not enough
for a winter hike.
- You want to hike?
- I'm not getting the cable car!
I don't even know the routes.
I've been there before.
We'll go slow, no hurry.
I'll need new boots too.
- I need to go, talk later.
- Kisses, bye.
State your emergency.
Hello, I need
the Mountain Rescue number, please.
- Your name, please?
- Daniela Simion.
- What is your emergency?
- Cosmin, pass a pen and paper!
I'll transfer the call
to the Buşteni Team.
Please, give me something
to write with. A pen or something.
- Have they answered?
- No.
- How many of you are there?
- Me and my boyfriend.
I'll try calling
the rescuers in Braşov. Don't panic.
We just don't know what to do.
- Hello, this is Mountain Rescue.
- We got lost on Jepi, please!
The wind is very strong,
we can't see, we...
- Don't try to advance.
- We couldn't anyway!
There's a huge boulder, we can't pass it.
- Stay where you are.
- Please, help us! Cosmin...
Hello?
Hello?
All right. Let them come along.
But not in front!
Behind your men.
Let's go!
All right, guys! Follow them.
Follow them.
Probe every square meter of snow,
no matter how shallow.
Copy that.
Cell One, advance diagonally
as far as you can on foot.
There's a boulder here.
Cell Three, turn that laptop screen
a little. Let's be discreet.
Understood.
Mountain troopers,
please get right under the ledge.
That ledge could collapse at any moment.
Have someone keep watch.
- Have someone keep an eye on it.
- Copy.
I see all three of you. Signal pulse!
Pulse response negative.
Confirmed. Now for the girl's number.
Result negative.
Confirmed.
One and Two, stay put. Three,
advance diagonally as far as possible.
Understood.
He's coming,
turn on the camera.
Is it on?
Mr. Jianu,
how is the search for your son going?
How did you secure the help
of the Intelligence Service?
- Let us do our job!
- Mr. Jianu!
- Mr. Jianu!
- No comment.
It's not that. My girl also went missing
on the mountain last night.
- I'm sorry.
- She was with friends.
She must have got lost.
She missed the cable car.
I get it.
I can feel she's all right,
but we don't know where to search.
If you could please help us,
tell us where to look.
How would I know?
I heard you can track her phone.
What? I can't. Who told you that?
The mountain rescuers.
That's nonsense.
- I'm begging you, help us.
- I don't have the equipment!
- They're talking nonsense.
- Mr. Jianu!
- I'm sorry, I can't help.
- Please, think of what I'm going through!
Please, I won't tell anyone!
- Mr. Jianu!
- A statement, please!
Any news on your son?
Why are you telling people crap?
- Like what?
- Like me having triangulation equipment.
- Well, don't you?
- So? Do you have to tell the world?
Why, is the equipment illegal?
None of your business!
A tourist went missing
on the mountain yesterday.
We looked until dark, so we thought...
So search for her. Don't get me involved!
Didn't you say you had all you needed?
- Yeah, but if you can help her...
- No, I can't!
Mr. Jianu.
That girl might have a chance.
With all that equipment and manpower,
if you wanted to make a difference,
this is your chance.
I'm looking for my own!
I didn't bring all that
for every airhead that gets lost!
Got it?
These people are desperate,
just like you were.
I won't lie to hide the fact
that your tent out there has the means
to locate missing people.
Mr. Jianu, any news
about your son's disappearance?
- Can you give us details?
- Just a few words!
- Please!
- I can't help you.
Mr. Jianu!
Three more areas triangulated.
Still nothing.
I'm thinking of sending people
to the opposite slope too.
Did you hear there's another missing girl?
Her mother came to me earlier,
asking about the triangulation equipment.
That idiot Cristian let it slip out.
It's the last thing we needed.
I can't help her.
- Then why are you fretting?
- How can I not?
When I see her crying,
begging, following me around...
What would I tell Filip, Paula?
"You broke the law for me,
now do it for everyone"?
I understand, it's just...
Please, Mircea.
Our son is our priority.
Yes, Paula.
Our son.
How come only some people
get tracking equipment?
Are you taking us for suckers?
Why won't you talk to us?
- Why are you out in the cold?
- Mircea, please, help them if you can.
What's this?
The missing tourist's phone number.
Her mother saw me exiting the tent.
Alina, no!
We're struggling to find Cosmin.
One number, how long would that take?
You don't understand what we're doing.
It's not even legal.
What if it was Cosmin instead of her?
And others had your influence?
Wouldn't you have asked for help?
Woman, these people
are only doing this for Cosmin.
He's been gone for a week.
She only went missing last night.
- Not my problem.
- What?
Can you hear yourself?
Yes, Alina, it's not my problem now!
You can save a life and you won't?
Is this who I'm having a baby with?
Spending my life with?
Andreea?
- How is she doing?
- Andreea!
Are you in pain?
- Does it hurt?
- Tell us, dear!
Your feet hurt?
You're safe now.
Easy now.
Two, three, go!
Boss!
Come quick.
Signal pulse.
Pulse response positive.
- Have you found him?
- It's the girl's phone.
And Cosmin's?
- Nothing yet.
- What now?
We move camp higher up, to get closer.
Save battery. We're coming up to
re-scan. We'll meet up at the snowmobiles.
- Copy.
- Daniela's phone!
Get ready to climb up.
Copy that.
Scanning unit, come here, please.
Check if that power outlet works.
Let's see.
This is the area we want.
You come from here.
I want a cell on this edge, one here,
and one on this slope,
as close as possible.
Set up the cameras.
Have them and the radios on at all times.
- All right?
- Yes, sir.
Off you go.
Cell One in position.
Two, I can't see you.
Almost in position.
Three, maintain position, I lost you.
Locking on a signal.
Cell One in position.
Cell Three
also in position.
Cell Two in position, connected.
Signal pulse.
Pulse response positive.
He's there.
Uh, let's try the IMEI code too.
Copy that.
Stay in position.
Both phones in the same spot.
It's no coincidence.
I'm sorry.
Repeating scan.
Signal pulse.
Pulse response positive.
They're there.
In those 30 to 40 square meters.
Can't tell how deep the snow is,
but it is quite deep.
Most likely an avalanche.
Pack up and let's get to base
before it gets dark.
Copy that.
They may be about ten meters deep
in an area of 27 square meters,
think about it.
Tons of snow on top of them.
God, and I prayed so much!
Yes, Paula,
you prayed so much for nothing.
- You prayed.
- Don't say that.
Why not? Give me that icon!
Give it to me.
- Forget it.
- What do I do now?
- What do I do?
- I don't know.
What am I going to do now, Mircea?
What do I do?
I don't know, Paula.
I'll search until I find him.
At least you did all you could.
What did I do?
I didn't find him alive,
so it's pointless.
You got all those people up here,
set up the whole operation.
Over here! This way!
Get the equipment here, guys!
- Viorel!
- Here!
I'll keep watch on that side.
- You cover this one.
- Got it.
You keep an eye on them.
Probe left.
Probe straight down.
Probe right.
Step forward.
Step forward.
I can feel something here!
Pass me a flag.
Get us another flag here!
Probe right.
Probe left.
As a freshman,
Cosmin had classes in the afternoon.
One winter evening,
he came home covered in blood.
I got so scared.
He'd been beaten up
by some thugs from school.
His father didn't get scared.
I don't know what he did,
but that night the police arrested
every thug in his school.
The whole lot.
They questioned them
with their parents present.
They intimidated them into confessing.
They were really scared.
The next day...
they all became Cosmin's protectors.
From then on,
I knew no one would hurt my son.
If anyone did, Mircea wouldn't quit
until he destroyed them.
But now...
it's a mountain.
You're so lucky to have another child.
Your daughter killed mine.
What? How can you say that?
- Have you heard their last calls?
- Yes.
Cosmin didn't want to do it.
She convinced him.
Madam, it was an accident!
Andrei! Come to Mommy.
I am telling you, it's impossible.
We'd need to move tons of snow.
Impossible? So what if it's tons?
We'll move it, meter by meter.
Mr. Jianu, I dug three meters down,
probed another six,
and still didn't hit the bottom.
It's like our chief told you,
it's all in vain now.
No! There are two children down there!
We must get them out whatever happens.
Filip, you promised!
Locating them is one thing,
getting them out is another.
We're not ready for what's out there.
I'm not saying it's easy.
I know it's very hard.
But if you with all your resources can't,
then who will do it?
I told you,
wait for the snow to melt.
No! Not in spring!
- Now!
- Mircea.
Some things can be done, some just can't.
If I hear "it can't be done"
one more time,
I'll see you all in hell!
Careful there.
- There they are.
- I can see them.
Thank you so much, Filip.
Back to the hut!
This isn't right.
I should have gone with them.
Avalanche!
Avalanche!
Filip!
Avalanche!
Avalanche!
- Avalanche, get them out!
- Faster!
Get out!
One and Two!
One and Two, can you hear me?
Help!
One and Two!
Mountain troopers!
Mountain Rescue, come in! Go get them out!
Mr. Jianu!
A statement, please!
How are you?
Can you feel your legs?
Can you feel your legs?
Easy now.
Fucking hell, Filip, I'm so sorry.
Good thing no one died.
We should be more careful
next time.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
- Filip, what's happening?
- We got orders to pull out.
Don't leave now!
- What was our mission?
- Find Cosmin.
"Locate him." Discreetly. We did.
- We can't get him out.
- We can!
Filip, we can!
One of my men broke his spine
in an unauthorized mission.
We're out.
- I'll call the colonel.
- Go ahead.
He said to tell you
our debt to you is now paid.
I don't want a scene.
Help me get my son out of there.
Listen.
No one in your situation
ever got more help.
You're right, but please help me.
It could have been your child.
Your child, Filip!
People!
It could have been the child
of any one of you!
Thank you!
The reward is guaranteed.
You have my number and Laurenţiu's.
I'll give you money to buy what you need.
If anyone else...
Trying to kill innocent people?
What do you want?
"Reward for searching
for two people in the Bucegi Mountains"?
- You want to die for money?
- Leave us. This has nothing to do with me.
Maybe it's another desperate parent
you couldn't help.
I called the police. They'll question you.
Fine, just leave us alone.
If a nutter dies with your fliers on them...
you go to jail.
I've got it. Now, get lost.
Don't stick them on walls. Got any more?
Only on tables in the restaurant
and under windscreen wipers.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
As I said, we need to hurry.
I'm really trying to understand,
but let me ask you.
- Where will we live?
- We'll rent a place.
Let's take the lift.
Alina.
- We'll build another house.
- It's our family home, Mircea!
Our child's home.
Now what, we go back to renting?
Just for your ambition,
which can't change Cosmin's fate?
That house is in my name.
It's our house.
Why aren't you asking Paula
to sell hers too?
Let's all sell our houses.
- When that money runs out, what then?
- What else can I do?
Give up this idea of selling.
- And let's go home.
- And do what, Alina?
Choose the wallpaper and...
And curtains?
Sit in the kitchen and drink coffee?
No, let's just stop living
because we're all in pain!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
But you pawned off our home!
- I'm so close to finding him!
- It's an illusion.
- No, it's not!
- Listen.
You're sinking deeper and deeper.
And pulling others in with you.
It's only an illusion
that you're almost there.
Instead of helping,
your ambition is dragging you down.
It makes you think you can do
more than is humanly possible.
And you're hurting people.
You're losing what we have.
And I don't deserve this.
That's true.
I just want us to go home.
I wish you'd come with me.
Please.
If you also care about me.
- Go home?
- Yes.
- You mean give up?
- No.
- What then?
- Face the truth.
What would I tell Paula?
Are you going to go on
to the bitter end for Paula's sake?
We will be by her side.
She will understand.
- Really?
- Given time.
How about this?
What if you were in Paula's situation?
If the one up there
was this child of ours?
And I was married to someone else?
What would you have me do?
Do the impossible to find him, even dead,
or give up, face the facts and go home?
Say you'd want me to face the facts,
and we're going home.
Alina!
Don't "Alina" me.
- Alina, don't leave like this.
- Like what?
- What is it?
- Come with me.
Come where?
- To church.
- I'm not coming.
Please, Mircea,
I want us to pray for our son.
I don't want to.
Thank you for coming.
It won't be easy, but...
as promised...
an advance for the volunteers.
If you know anyone who wants to join,
you can still call them.
Tell them to come.
This is the reward
for the one who finds them.
Laur will keep the money.
You have his number.
Let's go.
The sooner we set out, the better.
It's all we could put together.
We'll get more.
Every bit counts.
Laur, add this too.
Come on.
Everyone ready? Let's go.
Excuse me.
This is unbelievable.
- They're cutting in front!
- It's a special situation.
- What about us?
- Take the next one.
It leaves in 15 minutes.
Fucking fog.
You know what to do, right? Let's start!
Let's do this, Doru.
- Did you know them?
- From university.
We thought we'd light a candle,
if you don't mind.
Of course not.
We're so sorry.
Four, three, two, one...
Happy New Year!
What is this, Doru?
- We've done all we can.
- No, we haven't!
Doru, don't go, please!
Get in the car, dear.
- We can't find them now.
- Yes, we can!
- Doru!
- We've been here so long.
With no result.
Madam, please, don't go!
- Mom, when's Daniela coming back?
- See? He wants to know!
- Your daughter's up there too! Stay.
- We're drained, body and soul.
We have to move on,
figure out what to do next,
take care of our boy.
We're sorry.
Drive them home and come back!
I need your help.
I can't do this anymore.
Yes, you can!
I heard you want to leave.
Forgive me, Paula.
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
For leaving you two.
It's my fault for making you suffer.
All my fault.
Mircea.
I forgave you long ago.
But you need to forgive yourself.
Can't you feel this guilt
is dragging you down?
- You need to stop.
- I can't.
I don't want you hurting others
because you feel guilty about me.
I don't want you hurting Alina
or Laurenţiu.
Or the people who go up there with you
every day. Think of them.
I can't leave him there.
And I can't get to him on my own.
With me here, you'll feel guilty.
That's why I'm leaving.
And I want you to leave too.
Mircea.
We'll come back. As soon as we can.
In spring.
I'm not here to get you to quit.
I came because...
I miss you.
And if what you want to do here
is so important,
whatever happens, I want to be with you.
"For better or for worse," right?
Is this normal?
- Hello.
- I'm sorry, you can't.
What?
You have to wait in line.
The boss said so.
- Why not?
- I'm sorry.
It's been fine so far. Just take this and...
We're not doing this for fun!
I really can't.
Please.
It's a two-hour wait for some.
- You think you're special?
- Mind your own business.
We've been waiting for two hours!
Lupu, come on!
Let's go.
Boss, wait a minute.
Lupu, where are you going?
Boss!
Leave him.
Buşteni Rescue Two,
come in!
Reading you.
There's been an accident
on Jepii Mari.
Past Lambs' Valley, below the outpost.
How soon can you get there?
About two hours.
Any signs of life?
Some tourists saw a man fall.
We don't know if he's alive.
Copy that.
We'll gear up and go.
Hurry up.
We'll try,
but I think two hours is all we can do.
Just try to be quick.
We'll do our best.
All right. God bless.
Listen, how long would it take you?
Not sure, maybe an hour.
Or longer.
Go see what's happening.
- No. I'll stay with you.
- I can handle this.
Go help that guy.
- His mates have left already.
- So what?
Even a few minutes
can mean that man has a chance.
Go, don't just stare at me!
You too.
Laur!
- Go.
- I'll stay, boss.
Laurenţiu, I told you to go!
Please, man.
All right, boss.
Here's my radio.
I'll be back, boss!
Buşteni Rescue Hut Five,
come in!
This is Base, over.
We've found the tourist.
He's alive, albeit with some broken bones.
Good thing we found him in time.
Well done.
Bring him down.
Copy that.
Securing him to the stretcher.
He has hypothermia.
We'll take Pilaf Valley. It's very icy.
It will take a few hours.
Have an ambulance waiting.
Boss, can you hear me?
It's Laurenţiu.
Boss, we saved the guy.
I'm coming back to you.
Boss, come in!
