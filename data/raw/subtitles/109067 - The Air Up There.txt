Decisive moments.
Those
once-in-a-lifetime
moments.
That's what
we're talkin'
about here, Buddy.
Remember
your first uniform?
How you felt holding it,
seeing your number?
For me, it's like
it was ten minutes ago.
And I don't know
about you.
But I ran straight home
and found the mirror.
Am I right?
And in all my years as a player
and all the time I've put here
as an assistant coach,
you wanna know the one
feeling that topped that?
Standing...
In that runway...
Twelve guys dressed
in St. Joe's blue and gold,
listening to the sound
of 20,000 people...
Goin' out
of their minds.

You forgot the part
about the smell, the sweat
and the liniment.
Look at him.
He's out there dreaming about
his guest spot on arsenio.
[ Music stops ]
How many games are televised?
Ten nationally televised games
per season.
I want it in writing
that I crack starting lineup
freshmen year.
What?
[ Grunts ]
Ooh, it's not
a problem, Buddy.
Pro scouts gotta see me
on the floor.
My agent said put it in writing,
or I sign with U.N.L.V.
What else
does your agent want?
He said the school I pick won't
recruit another power forward
'til my junior year.
And wheels.
Something in a convertible
because of my height.
Saab's cool.
Karl Malone drives
a Saab convertible.

- We gotta get goin'. You have
dinner with the cheerleaders,

Hey, how about an A.C. Cobra?

- Buddy, what Jimmy means--
- hey, this program is only
as good as the deal I get.
- [ Buddy dribbling ball ]
- Look at the time.
Buddy, coach Fox wants
to see you before we meet up
with the cowbelles.
Hey, did I tell you
one of them was asked
to pose for playboy?
I wanna see the head fake.
This is the spot, right?
1981 championship.
- Jimmy, why don't you
show Buddy your ring?
- This is the spot.
The Jimmy Dolan

"The mouth that scored."
- Oh, shit.
- Bet you can't drive on me.
- I'll take a rain check.
- [ Sighs ]
Nah, come on, let's do it,

I'll even spot you five.

Fifty a point.
[ Exhales, grunts ]
Six times 50 is what?
Huh?
[ Grunts ]
- Once more.
- Aw, this is ridiculous.
This is--
aw,
you okay?
Guys, guys,
we really gotta get goin'.
- Seven times 50!

You're down 350.
Let me guess. Your agent

Keep your hands up!
[ Groans ]
Defense is more important

Buddy, we really
gotta get goin'.
There's nothin' uglier than
a bunch of hungry cheerleaders.
So, you wanna see
the head fake?
Jimmy Dolan's
"shake-and-bake."
It's a three-stage process.
Pay attention.
- [ Groans ]
- First,
you think
I'm gonna go left.
So, I indicate left.
But you know I'm not
gonna go with my first move,
not with this thing on my leg.
So, now...
I go left again!
Am I going too fast for you?
You having trouble following me
with that megabyte mind?
Okay, pay attention.
Here comes the second stage.
[ Panting ]
You think I'm tryin' to sell ya
on my right side.
But what I'm really doin'--
- [ panting heavily ]
- That's the third stage.
Hey, don't worry about it.
When it's really workin'...
I don't know where I'm goin'.
Buddy, don't sweat

[ Panting ]
You can take it out of the

And 19 lobster dinners.
That's a lot of lobster,

- There are
better power forwards.
- Oh, yeah? Name one.
- Conover.
- Conover?
You can deliver conover?
Damn straight!
Talked to his father yesterday.
He's in the bag.
Your bag,
the one with conover in it,
is addressed to Bobby knight.
Conover signed
a letter of intent with Indiana
yesterday afternoon.
I bet you lost a lot of sleep
waitin' to tell me that.
- Buddy Wilson was mine,
and you lost him!
- Mark, get outta here.
- You get--

The Wilson kid
is an asshole, Foxie.
Kid's 18.
You expect Gandhi maybe?
- He's not a team player!
- Yeah? Neither were you.
You were a showboat
and a ball hog.
I had to bench you almost
as many times as I brought
you home for dinner!
Look at you now.
You're practically
a functioning adult.
Jesus, Jimmy,
we needed that goddamn kid!
- Wouldn't want him on my team.
- It's not your team!
What is the matter
with you?
I mean, we keep
going over the same ground
time and time again!
You got one
of the finest basketball minds
I've ever come across,
but you haven't got a clue as
to what coaching's all about!
Why? Because I don't coach
the way you do? No, I'm sorry,
I don't play by the rules!
Because you don't see
the big picture! You're always
thinking about yourself!
You think I've been grooming you
for ten years for fun? Think
I'm gonna be here forever?
Foxie, you've been
sayin' that for years.
You're never gonna retire!
Not for you I'm not, because
never once have you proven to me
that you're ready for my job!
- And Collins has?
- He can bring in the talent!
He can recruit!
Hey, I gave everything
I had to Saint Joe's!
If I don't blow
my knee out senior year,
I'm playin' pro ball!
Hearts and flowers. Only reason
you're coachin' here is because
you can't be playin' there.
You still wanna
be the star!
I don't need this.
There's only room for one star
around here, ray, and that's
you! You got that covered!
Hey! Get your ass
back here! Jimmy!

This will be

[ Crowd gasps ]
In two weeks time,
I will make the recommendation
for my successor...
To the board of regents
at their annual meeting.
I know a lot of you

You come to the games. You come
to the dinners. Some of your
sons have played on the team--
...for providing serious
and catholic education...
To the farthest reaches
of the third world.
As you all know,
each year at our banquet,
we focus on
a specific mission.
And tonight,
it is my honor to bring you...
The Winabi Parish School
in Kenya.
Students at Winabi...
Are matriculating
through all 12 grades.
And there are plans for
a nurses' training program
next year.
Schools must
practically reach it's--
[ Chair scrapes on floor ]
And although the average age
of the teachers is 32,
they seem to be teaching
enormously well,
where ya going?
Under rather aggravated
circumstances because of
the size of the class they have.
But of course,
having so many classes...
Sports becomes
a very, very positive part--
yeah.
That's it.
Yes!
It turns out
the school is run...
By none other than
father Kermit O'Hara,
the other guard
on Bob cousy's holy cross team.
I looked up O'Hara's stats;
He's six-foot. Then, I had a
kid in the physics department...
Take the angle of the sun, depth
of the field and the camera
angle under consideration.
Given that data, this kid
is at least six-eight...
With a vertical leap
that's off the charts.
You're sayin' there was a second
gunman on the grassy knoll?
Eat me.
When's the last time you saw
a big man move like that?
[ Collins ] Buddy Wilson.
Do the names Olajuwon
Manute Bol, Dikembe Mutombo
mean anything to you?
All native africans,
all playing in the N.B.A.
The guard's got tits.
Small ones.
You're right. He's playing
against a girl.
- So what? Collins,
run that back, will ya?
- Turn it off, Mark.
I got a good feeling about this.
All I need is a week and you
spot me the airfare to Africa.
I already got
a flight booked, Jimmy.

They are remarkable people.
No kidding. This kid's got the

I'd forget about Saleh
if I were you.
Forget about him?
I just found a future
N.B.A. Hall of famer.
- What you found
is a headman's son.
- A what?
He's the son of Urudu,
chief of the Winabi.
Saleh's royalty,
like a prince.
- Is that the reason
for the bodyguard?
- Mm-hmm.
Saleh's gonna fit right in
at St. Joe's. We got
two princes, we got a Duke,
we got a sheik from Bahrain--
Saleh is the next in line
to lead his people.
His parents are
extremely protective.
Sister, parents
are my specialty.
All I gotta do is explain
to Saleh's mom and dad...
That I'm only gonna borrow him
for four years and return him
with a first-class education.
And your N.B.A.,
are they going to borrow him
after that?
After that, we'll see. Anyway,
Saleh's already on board.
Oh, how so?
I spoke to him last night and
he said very clearly, "jalang ."
- [ Sister laughing ]
- Why, what's so funny?
"Jalang," Mr. Dolan,
is a Winabi way of saying "no"
without insulting you.
It means, "I will
consider it for eternity."
Keep that on for an hour.
You know, it's working.
What is it?
It's iodine, kerosene
and sterilized camel stool.

Okay, and these elders,

Hi.
Listen, I thought
I would come up here
and try to explain.
Maybe I'm pressin'
a little hard, but it's
only because your son--
let me put it to you
like this. I could put him
with any four guys,
any four guys
and take that team
straight to the final four.
[ Chuckles ]
You probably don't even know
what the final four are.
Forget it.
Together, we could set up
a package that kept Saleh
away from home...
A maximum five months
at the most.
You could visit.
I don't know what your holiday
schedule is like, but--
I mean, if I may say so,
sir, you look to be
in quite good health,
and I mean that

- Maybe I could help.
- You are an outsider.
My father does not

[ Chuckles ]
Well.
Of course he doesn't trust me.
He-he doesn't even know me.

I'm gonna eat it too.
You guys go to work

he will too.

Now, you give me a sump pump
and a three-inch pipe, and I'll
cut your workload in half.
But then we could not
visit with each other.
We'll start...
With the fundamentals.
Now, all I want
you to do...
Is bend your knees,
just let it roll
off your fingertips.
You don't even
have to jump.
Nice shot.
Jimmy. This is harimbo.
He's not so much with
the shooting but--
I defend like a Buffalo.
You smell
like a Buffalo.
Don't start, ntzuko.
I'll crush you
like a cockroach.
Excuse me.
I'll play.
My sister's bridegroom-to-be.
My game is much larger
than I look.
I bet you say that
to all the girls.
All right...
Let's get it on.
Thank you.
Sign you up for a St. Joe's
season ticket packet, sister?
I wouldn't uncork your pom-poms
just yet, Mr. Dolan.

[ Groans ]
Hey, sister.
How ya' doin'?
[ Speaking in Swahili ]
I got Christmas tree lights
from father O'Hara.
I thought maybe we could
hook them up to your generator
for the wedding.
And I took you for
a typically American, selfishly
opportunistic sports pimp.
And all the while
you're actually a samaritan,
and a handyman to boot.
You're allowed
to say "pimp"?
Only if I really mean it.
Hey, what is it that pisses
you off so much about me?
Please, tell me, what?
You're always playing a game,
but you don't have a clue who
or what you're playing for.
Is that right?
Yes. You're frightened if you
stop playin', you'll disappear.
You're doing a mile a minute,
going absolutely nowhere.
The gospel according to Susan?
[ Groans ]
Something wrong?
[ Speaking in Swahili ]
At least I'm playin' instead
of dropping out and hiding
out here in the wilderness.
What did you say
to me?
Who do you think...
You're kidding? Do you know
what the elders call you?
"Nada ndimu."
The lemon nun.
Well, there's a new Winabi
word for the village idiot.
It's a "Dolan"!
[ Groans ]
You know, you're just jealous.
You're just jealous because you
know all the wonderful things...
I'm gonna be able to do
for these people once
I take Saleh back with me.
After you finish winning
the hearts and minds
of the Winabi?
- You don't think I'm gonna get
Saleh to come back with me?
- You don't have a prayer!
[ Chuckles ]
You see this ring, sister?
This is a 1981
national championship ring.
You can't buy
these rings, sister!
[ Groans ]
Fourth quarter.
We're down seven points
to Georgetown.
Nineteen seconds on the clock.

She wants you to come
to her wedding to ntzuko.
Great.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Where is ntzuko? I haven't
seen him around lately.
Not getting cold feet, is he?
Ntzuko is far away.
He is on a journey he must make
to become Winabi.

Beisa.
Beisa asks
if you're married?
[ Laughs ]
Uh, no.
No, I, uh...
Have a lot of girlfriends.
[ Speaking in Swahili ]
[ Beisa laughing ]
What did she say?
It's an old Winabi saying:
"The hunt is fun...
But does not keep you
warm at night."
[ Chuckles ]
She's gonna keep ntzuko busy.
Yes.
We're very happy
ntzuko is marrying her.
What's wrong?
Jimmy, there is something
my father hasn't told you.
Over a year ago,
a man named Nyaga came to us,
wanting to buy our land.
Nyaga? That's the fat guy
who owns mingori?
Yes.
He wants to own our land too.
It's very rich with copper.
But my father
refused to sell.
So Nyaga began attacking us
and stealing our cattle.
Cattle are a big thing
for you guys, right?
We depend on cattle.
Without them, we'll
have to leave our land.
Well...
Let's just hope cows
aren't considered
a recruiting violation.
[ Chattering in Swahili ]
♫ [ Woman singing in Swahili ]
You're beating me up on this.
This is the latest model
camcorder they make.
100,000 shillings
for the plane ticket,
50,000 for the camcorder;
That's my best.
You believe this guy?
If you need cash in a hurry,
there's always a premium.
It's true the world over.
- Jimmy, are you sure
you want to do this?
- All right,
150,000 for the ticket,
100,000 for the camcorder.
A hundred and twenty-five
for the ticket,
50,000 for the camera.
But you said
we might have more.
Don't worry about it.
You know, if I still owned
the video camera,
I would want the battery
to go with it.
Wait a minute.
[ Jimmy ]
When you need cash in a hurry,
you gotta pay a premium.
It's true
the world over.
Good morning!
Lose your traveler's checks,
coach Dolan?
[ Speaking in Swahili ]
Oh.
So, trying your hand
at cattle ranching, huh?
That's none
of your business.
[ Chuckling ]
Everything in mingori...
Is my business.
Not anymore.
I strongly suggest that
you take your memories
back to America...
Now.
Not until I'm done
seeing the sights.
[ People chattering ]
My father should have
seen that. Naftalanja!
Naftalanja!
By the way, what the hell
does that mean?
Naftalanja means the smell
after a heavy rain.
But when you say it, it means...
"Today my life starts fresh, and
my troubles are all behind me."
Naftalanja, my friend.
Saleh.
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?
[ Car horn honks ]
[ People chattering ]
Who was that?
Halawi.
Who?
My brother.
Your older brother?
No one--
you never said anything
about an older brother.
When Nyaga first offered to buy
our land, Halawi tried to make a
deal without my father knowing.
He thought Nyaga was the future.
My father felt betrayed.
So, he banished him.
He went to work for Nyaga.
To my father,
Halawi does not exist.
Man, I know
how that feels.

Number 30. You saw it!
He touched it! Yeah!
[ Whistle blows ]
Time, time, time, time!
All right.
Come on, come on.
All right.
Listen up, you guys.
Give me your eyes.
We're gonna call this play
"warthog in the weeds."
All right, Halawi,
I want you to take
the ball out of bounds
and pass it to ruwala.
Everyone's lined up
on the free throw line.
The object here is to draw
your man away from Saleh.
I want him isolated.
Alone.
One on one
with the big ugly guy.
It's up to you,
my man.
All right, here we go.
Hands in. One...
Two... three...
