One of the worst mining accidents
in Swedish history happened in 1961
at Idkerberget in Dalarna.
In the middle of the night,
an earthquake woke up the entire village,
{\an8}and a massive crater opened up
above the old mine.
{\an8}In May of 2020, the city of Kiruna quaked
{\an8}from the biggest rock burst
in Swedish history,
{\an8}which reached a 4.8 on the Richter scale.
{\an8}As the ground surrounding the mine
cracked and crumbled,
{\an8}the old city center was moved
three kilometers away,
{\an8}to an entirely new site.
{\an8}This, the world's biggest
underground mine,
causes over 100 tremors each year.
The worst part
is that you can never predict where
or when the next one will happen.
THE ABYSS
{\an8}KIRUNA, RIFT ZONE 03:23
Yeah!
Hey, idiot, where are you going?
{\an8}Gotta take a piss.
{\an8}- Come back, for fuck's sake.
- Where?
{\an8}Where are you going?
{\an8}Hey, wait! Where are you going?
{\an8}Fucking dumbass!
{\an8}You can't go past the fence!
It's not safe!
{\an8}Come back! Just pee back here!
{\an8}Woo-hoo! Yeah!
{\an8}LUOSSAVAARA MOUNTAIN 07:14
Aren't you off today?
There's a 2.6 up at Luossa.
How about "good morning," Frigga?
It's 7:00 a.m.
Good morning.
Anything happening?
Well, yes, actually.
We recorded a seismic event
at 3.4 in the rift zone,
{\an8}just after the blasting.
{\an8}KIRUNA MINE, 1345 METERS UNDERGROUND 07:15
{\an8}So I sent a car to check on it,
but, yeah, they didn't see anything.
Uh. Nothing outside the fence, at least.
Just a few beer bottles after some party.
Where the hell did he go?
Takes a while
to piss out a six-pack.
{\an8}Yo, watch the beer.
{\an8}CAVE-IN ZONE
NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
{\an8}- Come on.
- Coming!
Hey.
- Hmm?
- Casper.
- Look how deep it is.
- Whoa.
- How far do you think it goes down?
- I don't know...
What the fuck, man?
You're such a fucking idiot.
You know that, right?
What the fuck?
- What's the deal with these bugs?
- Let's go. They all went already.
- Hey, did you spike this with moonshine?
- It's fucking...
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
The fuck?
It's probably still unstable.
Nah, not really.
Or your life is unstable is what you mean.
I love my life.
Yeah, I know.
I went and replaced the geophone
on Luossa. You see it?
Yep.
And it's Simon's birthday.
You didn't forget, right?
No, I didn't. It's Tage's week.
{\an8}NEW KIRUNA 09:00
{\an8}I'm starting to get worried,
{\an8}so please call me
when you get this, Simon, okay?
Bye.
Well, I guess
it'll just be the two of us, cake.
You and me.
Casper!
It was just a prank, dude.
- He's hating this.
- So damn grumpy.
- Love you.
- Happy birthday, little man.
Mwah. Happy birthday.
Bet you can't blow them all out
at the same time.
He's gonna be too cool
with that bag.
- Call of Duty?
- Mm-hmm.
YOU REMEMBER I NEED A RIDE TONIGHT, RIGHT?
OF COURSE, NO PROBLEM!
I FUCKING HATE YOU!!
{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SIMON
{\an8}HOPE EVERYTHING'S GOOD AT DAD'S
Hello?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I'm here.
Fucking hell.
Why are you here so soon?
"Welcome to Kiruna, Dabir.
It's so nice to see you. I missed you."
We agreed on the evening train.
Yeah, but you also said
that today you were going to be
without your son on his birthday
for the first time,
so I thought I'd surprise you.
Surprise.
Sorry.
Well, um, I...
It's okay.
Hi.
Hi.
You can put that with the rest
on the floor.
Why would people live here?
The northern lights.
And that thing.
That thing is big and ugly.
I think she's beautiful.
So it's a "she" then?
It's called "Sweden's womb."
I can't believe an entire city is moving
'cause of her.
Yeah, but every meter we mine
makes it more dangerous,
so nobody will be able to live here
in a couple of years.
I'm gonna stay
a little longer than planned.
Huh?
Yeah, well, you know Jocke,
the fire chief, he...
he offered me a job.
So I thought I'd stick around,
see how life is up here.
Well, it's, um, dark for a month straight
in the winter, in case you didn't know.
Yeah, sometimes love can be really tough.
Oh my God. For fuck's sake.
You'll have to stay at a hotel tomorrow.
The kids are coming.
- Okay.
- Okay.
What the hell?
Why do they even bother?
Okay, uh, Frigga...
It's okay.
They've been here every day this week.
Some people don't understand,
we can't move every building in the city.
Save our Ovttas!
Kiruna's dying!
- Save our...
- What's Ovttas?
It's a café
that's going to be torn down.
Kiruna's dying!
Save our Ovttas! Kiruna's dying!
Save our...
I'll call the police
if you aren't gonna move now.
- Why don't we take another route?
- Kiruna's dying!
- Save our Ovttas!
- No way.
Kiruna's dying! Save our Ovttas...
Wait, wait. What are you doing? Frigga.
...our Ovttas! Kiruna's dying!
Kiruna's dying! Save our...
What are you doing?
- Mica, come on!
- You can't just give up, Aila!
Stop the car, you fucking idiot!
- Save our Ovttas! Kiruna's dying!
- The hell are you doing? Stop.
Save our Ovttas! Kiruna...
- Get out of the way!
- No one's dead.
- Mica!
- You can calm down.
That's fucked up.
What the hell is she doing?
I think I won this time.
Get up now.
- Come on.
- Do you need help?
Come on.
Aila, your grandma's coming.
You have to stop doing this.
I could lose my job. Understand...
And what about Aila and Livli?
They're losing their home.
And Ovttas is one
of the oldest buildings here.
Why aren't they moving it?
I have no idea, Mica.
I work at the mine as head of security.
- I have nothing to do with moving...
- Yeah, but you work for those assholes.
Hmm.
Mica, even though we might lose our home,
you know you still have to
respect your mother.
And you should feel proud
for having a daughter who's so passionate.
Should I be proud of a kid
who protests about the mine
and keeps people from getting to work?
Kids are supposed to rebel.
God knows you did.
Hey, who the fuck is that?
Who is he?
That's Dabir.
Fucking brat.
Mica seems like she's a tough one.
Twenty years of arguing.
Simon's adopted, I take it?
What?
He doesn't look like
a piece of gum at all.
Oh well.
What is that?
It's from my dad.
It makes me feel safe.
Well, do you?
I missed you.
Was that just you making the earth move?
Damn, that is so cheesy.
You didn't say
you get earthquakes up here.
That was a rock burst.
The mountain makes small adjustments
all the time.
You get used to it.
And I'll take care of you if you don't.
Hmm.
Ida!
Ida, shut up!
Hey, calm down!
I said calm down!
You were quicker than usual.
Jet lag.
That's what happens.
Do you miss him?
Every day for 30 years now.
I was the one who insisted
that my dad take me with him
for the blasting.
But I feel like I'm... honoring his memory
by making sure the mine is safe.
Don't look at me. It's your house.
You've got to be kidding.
Have you ever heard
of fucking boundaries?
- Yeah, well, where's Mica?
- It's your week.
I know,
but Simon isn't at my house.
And he hasn't answered his phone
all morning,
so I thought he might have
spent the night here.
I don't think so.
Right.
Hey.
Hey.
I think I... I'm gonna wait outside.
- You really don't need to.
- He probably should though.
Instead of barging in
like you own the place,
you could call first...
I do own the place, actually.
Half of it.
Tage Vibenius.
I'm the old one.
Dabir Ayobi, the new one.
Right.
So now you've met each other.
Thanks for ruining the whole protest, Mom.
You brought him home?
On Simon's birthday, so he could meet Dad?
You were supposed to be at my house
to celebrate Simon.
I know. Sorry.
There was some idiot
who hit me with their car,
so my sign got trashed.
What? Are you hurt?
No, Mom saved me.
Shall we sing?
We might as well.
Anything I can do?
Sure.
Get candles from the cupboard.
You okay?
This looks good, Tage.
Why is he here today?
Sorry?
Why is he in our house today?
Mica was conceived on that couch,
for God's sake.
Yes, Tage.
And you and I decided to get divorced
on that couch. And that's life.
Simon must have left
after he heard you two going at it, and...
That's enough.
Do you wanna listen in
on the next one too?
Oh my God. Fuck.
I thought so.
He was probably up all night
playing video games.
Which is what ruined last week for him.
- Apparently, he's been skipping classes.
- It's your week, Tage.
- Let's wake him up?
- Mm-hmm.
- Surprise him from the other side?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, how are we doing this?
- Ready?
Damn, you're annoying.
You coming?
Okay.
Wakey, wakey, Simon.
There.
Right, well...
Mica?
How should I know where he is?
Are you in a fight with him?
I haven't seen him since he went to yours.
Right, yeah.
Frigga.
Oh, hey, Gerda.
Um... No, he wasn't here last night.
I'll call if I hear something.
I'm sure he's okay. Yeah?
Bye.
That was Oliver's mom.
And?
He said he was spending the night
at Simon's.
- You're so fucking clueless, Tage.
- Really?
It's your week.
Where's the PS5 I got him?
Where is he?
Yeah?
- Hello?
- What's going on?
- Is anyone hurt?
- No, we're here. We both are.
- Okay.
- Was that normal?
Everyone out of the mine.
Only the rescue crews can be down there.
- No, that wasn't normal.
- What do you mean, "not normal"?
Frigga.
How bad is it?
Don't think about shutting down the mine
before talking to me.
Don't worry yet, it's not as bad
as the one from two years ago.
But I've gotta go.
Mica, if you know where Simon might be,
then please tell me right now.
I just know that he's pissed.
- You need to go find him.
- What?
Why am I always the one
keeping track of his shit?
Learn the definition of "always,"
then you might get what it's like for us.
"Oh, Mica, how are you?
How's everything with Aila?"
- "You're so smart. I'm so happy..."
- Find him. Mica.
"... that you're my daughter. Oh."
Find him. Now.
- Ida!
- Uh...
- What's going on with the dogs?
- I don't know.
Calm down!
Shut up!
Just stay calm.
Try again and pop the hood.
We don't have time for that.
Just ride with us.
All right, let's go.
Funny thing, your car acting up,
seeing as you work on it every day.
What's going on over there?
There was a cave-in,
but no one was hurt, so...
Why do you have to go?
Aren't there people on-site?
No one knows the mountain like Frigga.
I'm the one who's responsible
for judging the safety.
You're welcome to take the car
and then pick me up.
Where are you from?
Uppsala.
- Long way from home.
- Oh, come on.
Come on. What's wrong?
I'm just trying to get to know the man
sleeping in the same home as my children.
- Who shares a couch with you.
- Yes, I'm a long way from home.
- But so are you, right?
- Tampere.
Lived here since I was 15.
Ah. Your parents got jobs
in the mine, I'll take it?
Actually, I'm the head
of operations there.
Hmm.
Tage, I'm sorry
you had to meet me like this.
I get that it's difficult for you.
Cut it out.
Give it a rest. I'll smack you.
You wouldn't dare.
That little fucking shit.
Where the fuck is my car?
One scratch and you're fucking dead.
He's had it so fucking easy.
I don't get it.
He's never had to...
He's never had to clean.
He's never had to do the dishes.
He's never... he's never had to do anything.
Your parents were probably
just so fed up with all your shit,
they decided to be less strict with him.
Oh, yeah.
Like you're so fucking perfect yourself.
- Nah.
- Nah.
Mm.
Good thing I love this face.
Do you think we have some time?
I bet the couch is still warm.
- Mm! That's right.
- Mm.
I have to find Simon right now though.
Yeah, well, he's probably
been gaming all night.
And you'll have to get out first.
Oh, hey, hey!
Hey! Oh no, you don't.
But, like, how could I ever
get outta here?
If I'm taking care of him all the time,
it won't work.
Stay here with me then.
And we'll change the world
from here, together.
- Aila, come on.
- Together.
- Come to Stockholm with me instead.
- Mica, cut it out.
Okay, let's meet at Ovttas
before the parkour kids get there.
- Mm.
- Just gotta find the dickhead first.
{\an8}KIRUNA MINE 11:56
Hey!
Cave-in happened somewhere
between level 520 and 750.
The team on 1,345 is being evacuated now.
Good job. And your boys?
Both were down there when it happened,
so I was worried.
- But they're okay?
- Phew.
How many are still down there?
Hundred and eight workers
and four from the rescue service.
How bad is the damage
on level 175?
Put Carl on at 1,345.
Yeah, the bus is leaving in five,
and everyone, except for the last 22,
are on their way up.
Good. No cave-in then?
Nothing serious,
but I think that we're, uh...
- You hear that? Nothing serious.
- ...probably, uh...
...gonna have to do some redecorating
in the break room, though.
I can live with that. Get up here now.
Will do.
Um, Fredrik, Dabir. Dabir, Fredrik.
- Frigga's new boy toy.
- Okay!
Hey. I had no idea
the mine was owned by the government.
You bet it is. It belongs to all of us.
The steel is so important,
not even the Green Party will talk about
how the industry is responsible
for most of Sweden's emissions.
Call you later.
"Come to Kiruna, Dabir.
It'll be so great."
She's not gonna call you later.
She's married to the job.
Aren't we all though?
Dabir, my kids don't need another dad.
Tage, I didn't come here for your kids.
Right.
You're here for my wife.
People always like to say
that life is what you make it,
but that's not true.
Someone's always trying to meddle
in your fucking business all the time.
Is that your fireman?
He took an earlier train.
I wasn't planning on
introducing him to Tage just yet,
but, uh, there was a jaw drop.
So passive-aggressive.
Not very passive, I would say.
- I love her.
- I love her too.
We have a family.
I feel like that gives me the advantage.
If you really love her, you'd let her
choose to be with who she wants.
Neither of us gets to decide
who she wants to sleep with.
But you know we're still married.
She's had the divorce papers
for six months
and still hasn't signed them.
Why would it matter
if the divorce papers are signed?
My brother's all the way out on his farm
and said he still felt the tremor.
Yeah? I'm sure she's fine now.
Don't jinx it.
You know you're doing an amazing job.
Your dad would have been proud.
I need her to settle down.
Because Bosse and I are taking a vacation
down to the vineyards in Scania.
Yeah, but he sheds so much,
you'll go crazy
before you even get to Piteå.
- Fifteen crowns.
- You're on.
You're so screwed.
Oh! Jesus!
Run him over. Run him over.
- Hey.
- How come you're going down?
Didn't think you liked being underground.
Even if there's a good reason,
it's gonna be me hanged
if Frigga decides to shut down the mine.
Yeah.
Miss you, Dad.
WORRYING NEVER MAKES TOMORROW EASIER
IT ONLY MAKES TODAY DREARIER
{\an8}KIRUNA MINE, 520 METERS UNDERGROUND
12:22
Hey...
What if Simon's left Kiruna?
To go where?
I'm not sure, but...
I would feel a lot better
if his PS5 were still at home.
He never goes anywhere without that thing.
Ever.
Frigga.
I can tell you and Simon
have been fighting again.
Do you wanna talk about it?
Why would we be fighting?
Morning.
- Morning.
- Find anything yet?
A lot of debris in the tunnel,
so the cave-in must have happened here.
Don't you always greet her?
What are you talking about?
The Lady.
Don't think the new generation cares
about that stuff.
What do they mean by that?
Don't ask me, man.
The Lady of the Mine
watches over the mountain.
If she's dressed in white, you're good.
In black, you'll die
when the rock caves in.
It's just her and us down here,
so you've gotta show her
a little respect, Patrik.
Well, you're supposed to knock on the rock
before you go down the mine,
not when you've already been down
for a while.
Okay. Um...
The rock reinforcement in the ceiling
has come loose.
We don't even work in this area anymore.
Tage, you know the entire mountain
has to be safe, or we can't work anywhere.
She doesn't sound very good.
Do you know what the saddest thing
about this town is?
Everyone walking around
with fucking helmet hair?
Sounds like she's constipated.
Here, take a look
at this right here.
It's time to leave her alone.
The ore's gonna run out someday anyway.
What'll we do then?
By the time that happens,
we'll both be long gone.
Hmm.
Ah!
- My God! Are you okay?
- What the fuck?
Frigga, can you hear me?
Patrik!
Hey, Frigga!
Hurry!
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I'm okay.
- Look at me.
- I'm fine.
- The hell happened?
- Okay?
- Everything's fine.
- You... you're bleeding.
I'm okay.
- Head to Ovttas. I'm starving.
- Has Simon been here?
Nah, don't know. Ask Emo-Linda.
Have you guys seen Simon?
- Simon? Simon? Simon?
- Lost your brother again, huh?
- Have you seen Simon?
- Nope.
Okay, any idea where he could be?
You know what a night in there
does to you?
It fucks up your head, okay?
You have to stay on your toes,
dodge all the people...
Uh, okay. So no Simon, then?
They came in,
they bought cheat codes, energy drinks,
and drove off to some party...
- Wait, so he was here?
- Do I look like an NPC?
This conversation isn't different
just because you ask
the same question differently, Mica.
Which way did they drive off?
Little shit.
BROTHER
This looks like it never ends.
Why haven't we seen
this huge cavity before?
We haven't mined here in 40 years.
What are you looking for?
How deep are we?
1.6 kilometers right now.
Which direction?
Kiruna.
We have to evacuate.
Now.
Sure. Tuesday it is.
- Mm...
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.
- That sounds great, Aila.
- Hi!
- Come look over here.
- Talk later.
- Sure.
Great. What is it?
Where are we going?
Ew, that's gross.
They're beautiful 'cause, um,
my mom says
they only crawl out of the ground
when the mountain moves.
Cool, right?
Nah.
LOOK!
LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Help!
Help!
- Help! Help!
- Anton!
- Anton! Anton!
- Help!
- Help! Help!
- Hang on!
Totally fucking insane.
So crazy, right?
We couldn't even hear it.
We'll have to put up a fence
around the sandbox so that, uh...
Uh-huh.
I guess we'll...
- Call the fire department.
- Yeah.
Call Anton's parents for me.
Come on.
Frigga.
Listen to me, please.
Yeah, of course, we can evacuate,
but we have to know for sure
that's really necessary, okay?
This much tension, plus a fault
in the mountain this fucking huge
means that the mine is gonna move
in a very unpleasant way.
The mountain just needs to calm down.
That's what you always say, isn't it?
This is not a fucking settlement.
Do you hear me?
The whole city's about to collapse.
Simon and Mica.
Call Fredrik, and get everybody out.
Wait. Wait.
I need your help now.
Tage.
Tage? Hello?
The rescue chamber, now!
- Go! Move! Go! Go!
- Wait, wait!
Hurry up!
Look out!
Calm? No, you weren't calm.
You were panicking.
- Panicking?
- Sure, you know.
I was dangling along like a limp fish.
Yeah, I could probably
still drag you out if...
Joakim! Joakim.
We got a call that Bert's kid almost
just got sucked into a hole in the ground.
He was in a sandbox.
It just opened up right underneath him.
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.
Send truck number three
once they've pulled out
the bus stuck downtown.
Yeah.
Sucked into a sandbox is a new one.
Since the rock burst,
we've had problems
with broken water pipes,
runaway dogs, insect infestations.
And then there's this bus that got
stuck inside a huge fucking crack
in the road.
Is it like this every day?
Well, shit, you know, it's Kiruna.
I heard you were in line
to become the new chief in Uppsala.
- Mm-hmm.
- And now you wanna marry Frigga Vibenius.
And live here in the middle of nowhere.
Well, it could just be a mistake.
I don't know.
Apparently, she's had the divorce papers
for six months and hasn't signed them.
Well, life with Frigga won't be boring,
you know that.
It's not the first time
they've thought about divorce.
They've been back and forth
a few times over the years.
I feel more and more
like I shouldn't be here.
Listen, Dabir, for real...
you could help me a lot around here.
And if your love for Frigga is true,
then it's worth fighting for.
Hell, give it a try.
Have a look around, go for a walk,
and you'll see, this town's not so bad.
Nah, it's not bad, just full of cracks.
Rise and shine, little idiot.
Oliver? The fuck you doing in my car?
- My head hurts.
- Where the hell is...
I'll fucking kill him.
Open the door right now!
- No.
- Open the door!
I'll fucking kill... Hold on, what the...
Did you drive my car fucking wasted?
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Come on. Fuck.
- Mica!
- Hey!
- Whoa!
- Mica, calm down, for fuck's sake!
He won't open the door.
You have a rock! Hit him with that
and you can forget about Stockholm.
He's wasted in my fucking car! My car!
And Stockholm, who gives a fuck?
- I know you're not coming.
- Oh my God, Mica.
I wanna help my grandma,
'cause she needs me more than ever.
She's all I've got.
You should appreciate what you have.
You're just like Frigga.
Maybe we shouldn't see each other
anymore then.
I don't need another mom.
Whoa!
Idiot!
Hey!
Hey! Mica!
- Where the hell is Simon?
- Mica!
Mica.
- The hell are you doing?
- Let go!
Take it easy.
- Take it easy.
- He stole my car.
- What?
- The fuck were you doing in my car?
Sleeping. I...
I drank too much of Carol's moonshine,
and everyone just disappeared...
Where's Simon?
I... I have no idea.
Where is he?
Was he with you or not?
Just please don't tell my mom.
- She'll freak out.
- Whatever.
Okay.
The rift zone.
Down on Bromsvägen.
You're such a little shit.
Give me the car keys.
Take it easy.
- Calm down.
- What, a woman can't be angry?
Can you not handle it?
Don't think it'll last long
with my mom in that case.
Easier to get what you want
if you stay calm.
Or you could just scare them
and get what you want right away.
Still no signal?
Huh?
We have to make our way up.
That fault must have been there
for a while.
What do you mean?
There wasn't anything we could've done.
If it hadn't been for the tremor
this morning,
we never would've found that cavity.
So we're gonna die?
I don't wanna die.
No, Patrik. But we have to get out fast.
I can't... I can't die.
Fabbe's still at school.
- What will the teachers say if I...
- Sh, shoo, shoo.
What do you think Fabbe's doing right now?
You know, I bet he's...
I bet he's learning all about trees.
Which one's his favorite? Huh?
Is it... uh, oak?
Or is it a willow tree?
Huh?
Hey.
Hmm?
This is a lot.
We're gonna make it.
Think she's ready for us?
No time to wait. We have to warn everyone.
Oh fuck.
We're trapped.
We'll find a way out.
The rescue ladders.
They haven't been used for 20 years.
What if we don't make it out?
No one's coming down here
until they've made sure
the whole mountain is safe.
They won't send help for days.
We don't have days down here.
Exactly.
Doesn't she love you?
She says she does.
Mm...
So then you were gonna propose
with your pants off?
No, I wasn't, actually.
It didn't go exactly as I planned.
Hmm.
Did you know that Frigga
hasn't signed the divorce papers?
Yeah.
Why would she do that?
'Cause she knows it's gonna crush my dad.
Of course.
But a divorce is also
just a piece of paper.
It doesn't really matter.
I feel like your girlfriend's a keeper.
- You really like, uh...
- Aila.
Aila.
Come help me with something.
We're screwed.
We have to find another way.
There is no other way.
Even if you make it through there,
claustrophobe Tage won't go through that.
We have no choice.
Frigga...
I'll give it a shot.
Send the others when I get through.
Mm.
Mm.
Okay, you guys, I'm through!
Tage's turn!
- Tage, there, she made it.
- Uh...
W... we're gonna let,
um, Patrik go first.
Hey, hey. You know what?
I think Frigga needs you right now.
Frigga needs you on the other side.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Hmm?
No! I... I can't do it.
The whole thing's gonna collapse.
Tage, it's seven meters, tops.
Okay?
Listen to my voice and start crawling.
Come on.
Do you hear me?
Hey. What's wrong? What's wrong?
- Huh?
- I can't do it!
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I get it. This is terrible.
Your brain is... is playing tricks on you.
And you're having all sorts
of irrational thoughts, and you're...
They're completely rational.
If you see it from my point of view, it's...
- Sure.
- ...completely rational.
Um...
We... We...
We have a slight problem here, Frigga!
Come on.
I tried! I can't help it!
My entire body is just screaming "no"!
Simon's gonna have the shittiest birthday
of his whole life
if you and I die down here today, okay?
So come on!
- Think about Simon, Tage.
- Oh my fucking God.
Think about Simon.
- Come on, Tage.
- I'm coming!
- You can stop singing.
- Good.
I'm coming.
You're doing great, Tage!
I can see you. There's not much left now.
You're fine. Come on.
Take it easy.
Breathe, Tage. Easy. Breathe. Easy.
Tage, breathe!
I'm stuck!
Ah!
Ah!
Frigga!
I... I can't move.
- Tage, you can move.
- Frigga!
- Tage, listen to me. You need to relax.
- I'm stuck down here!
- You're not stuck. Listen.
- We're all gonna die down here!
- Hey. You're not stuck. Just keep going.
- We're gonna die down here!
We're all gonna die!
Frigga!
Ah!
We're gonna die down here!
We're all gonna die down here!
- Frigga! We're all gonna die!
- Grab on to this.
- Grab this. I'll pull you out.
- I can't! I'm stuck!
- You hear me? Grab it now!
- Help me!
Tage?
- I'm gonna... Frigga!
- Tage, calm down now.
- ...die here! Frigga!
- Stop, Tage!
- I'm stuck! I can't!
- Tage! Just take the...
What happened?
Why did everything go quiet?
Um...
He passed out, but I got it though.
{\an8}KIRUNA, RIFT ZONE 15:37
I bet he's here somewhere, passed out.
Simon!
Mica, do you hear that?
- What?
- There's a phone ringing.
Mica. Hold on, Mica.
Is this a smart idea?
Seems dangerous.
Well, I guess the danger is
that my mom will never talk to you again
if you don't help me find her son.
You're a hell of a lot like Frigga,
you know that?
What is this place?
The rift zone.
This is what'll happen to Kiruna
if we don't move the city.
What the hell?
Okay.
Okay.
It's okay, honey.
Did you hit me in the face?
No.
You got hit in the head by a rock
and passed out.
Okay, Tage.
Okay.
There, there, there.
Oh, hugging you again feels amazing.
Okay.
Plus, you haven't called me "honey"
in forever.
Just because we have sex sometimes,
doesn't mean I'm coming back.
But it's not just sex for me.
That's the difference.
I love you.
Just not like that.
Can someone help me out, please?
Easy now. Easy, easy. Come on.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, Erika.
Come on.
Hurry up now.
Ah!
What's wrong, Erika?
A rock fell on my foot!
Can you try kicking it off?
It... Get off!
You can do it. You've got it.
Kick it off with the other leg. Come on.
I can't even feel my leg anymore!
Come on.
It hurts so fucking much!
You have to try, Erika.
Come on. Come on!
Come on, Erika.
Good thing
I never had any fucking kids, I guess.
What are you talking about? You have me.
And Bosse. Come on now, damn it!
You owe me 15 bucks.
Come on, for fuck's sake!
Come on!
Come on, Erika!
Oh yeah, there goes my leg.
Hurry.
Fucking hurry up!
No! Erika! Erika!
Erika!
Erika! Erika! Erika!
Erika! No! No!
No!
- Frigga! Frigga, come here!
- She needs help in there!
- Stop it! Hey! Hey!
- Get off me!
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What the fuck? What the fuck?
You go first.
You first.
Go!
You're next.
Hello? Is anybody there? Simon?
Simon!
Hello?
- Hello?
- Where are you?
I've been trying to reach you nonstop
since last night.
You're in so much fucking trouble.
Don't ring. Don't ring. Don't ring.
I don't think he's here.
Jocke's phone.
- Hey, Jocke.
- Hey, what's up?
Don't ask me why,
but I'm at the rift zone.
- The hell are you doing?
- I'm inside the fence.
I couldn't save her.
If I hadn't taken so long, maybe she'd...
Come on. Let's go.
We have to keep going.
Let's go, Tage.
Make sure
that no one leaves the area,
except for...
Mica? Can you hear me?
- Yeah, Mom, I'm at the rift zone, and...
- The hell are you doing at the rift zone?
Calm down and just listen.
I'm at the rift zone,
and the cracks have gotten huge.
And I think people have been partying
inside the fence.
- There's phones ringing.
- She didn't make it.
I can't help thinking,
what if someone fell down?
What are you...
What are you doing there?
I think Simon was here,
but I don't know now.
- So where is he?
- No idea.
Mica, leave it to the police.
Call the police. Leave Simon to me.
Dabir's on the phone
with the fire department.
Dabir's there with you?
Okay, good. Listen.
Don't go back into Kiruna.
Don't go back into Kiruna.
Go to Dad's new apartment, okay?
Go to New Kiruna. Mica?
- Why?
- Kiruna's collapsing.
Aila.
- Mica!
- Where is she?
Frigga?
- Mica's in town. We have to stop her.
- I heard about Erika. Are you okay?
There's a massive fucking fault
right underneath Kiruna.
One tremor
and the entire city will collapse.
Activate the warning system right now.
We have to stabilize
the mountain first, and...
There's no time, Fredrik!
We need to get everyone out!
Can I borrow your car?
Where are you going?
- Grabbing the kids. The keys.
- You can't go to the city.
- The keys.
- I'll drive.
Alert the public.
- What's happening?
- There's an emergency.
SAVE OVTTAS
Have you heard anything?
I wonder if something happened.
Let me check the news.
No way, man. I'm not staying.
{\an8}IMPORTANT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
{\an8}THE EMERGENCY SERVICES URGES EVERYONE
TO GO TO NEW KIRUNA
- You need to go to New Kiruna now.
- Mica, hang on.
- Call me. I love you.
- We have to wait for the rescue...
- I have to get Aila now!
- What did Frigga say?
What the hell?
Come on.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What did Frigga say?
- She's calling me right now.
- The city's collapsing.
- Wait! You can't go!
- I have to get Aila. What don't you get?
- It's too dangerous!
- You would go get Mom if it was her!
Shit!
Simon might be at my place now.
For sure.
When all of this is over,
I'll try to move on.
I'll give, um, Dabir a chance.
Is that Simon?
Drive. Drive. Take the sidewalk.
- Hey! Get out of the way!
- Whoa!
Idiot!
Hey! Don't hit me!
He nearly hit me!
I heard the sirens.
Why are there sirens?
You think he saw us?
- What happened?
- Frigga, what's going on?
- Is it a drill or something?
- No. Go to New Kiruna right now.
What the hell does that mean?
- What happened?
- Hey. Come on.
You must leave the city.
Leave the city. Just go.
- Watch out!
- Whoa!
Wait here.
W... what's going on? What...
Can't you guys hear the alarm?
- I'm finishing up now.
- I've been trying to call you.
- My phone's charging. What's wrong?
- All of you, get out. Get to New Kiruna.
It's not safe to stay.
She told me the city's collapsing.
- Did she hit her head in the fall?
- No.
Come over to this side
and hold up her legs for me.
- Go to New Kiruna.
- Leave.
- Are you deaf? You have to leave the...
- Ah!
Watch out!
Hey, watch out.
I forgot something.
One... one second.
No. No, Livli, we have to go now.
I don't know why I just say
stuff like that, and, uh...
Of course you shouldn't have to
leave your family.
I was thinking.
I'll come with you.
I love you.
Is it over?
You all know
why we have to move the city somewhere.
It's too dangerous now.
I asked Simon
what he wanted for his birthday,
but he didn't stop by this morning
to get it.
He said he was coming here? When?
I'm not sure. He said he'd come
before they were too deep in it.
Too deep in it?
"Verdansk"? Where is that?
I think he's going to a school there
or something.
- Hmm.
- Come on.
- What's her name?
- Monika.
- Monika. Monika?
- Yeah.
What's he doing?
Does it hurt anywhere?
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay.
What the hell are they doing?
What?
Hey, can you get out and look?
Drive!
Fucking drive right now!
- It's not working!
- Go! Drive!
Back up. I said back up!
Fucking hell!
Go to New Kiruna!
Now! Go now!
Move out of the street!
What don't you understand?
Back up! It's not safe here!
Get out!
Out, out, out!
Help up! Help us!
Let's go! Out, out, out!
Mica, you have to get out!
Dabir, it won't come off!
The fuck you think I'm trying to do?
Watch out!
Hold on, hold on!
I'm right here.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
- No!
- Come on!
Careful!
Aila! Hurry!
Aila!
- Aila!
- No! No!
Get up there! Up!
Fuck!
Come on!
- Fuck!
- Open the windows, Mica!
Pull, pull, pull! Pull on the belt too!
Open the windows all the way!
- Come on.
- Fucking just cut it! Fuck!
- Oh!
- Oh no!
No, no, no, no! No, no, stay here!
Come on, pull. Got it!
There.
Get out, get out! Come on, hurry!
Come on, Mica!
Come on, run!
Run!
Run!
Come on, run!
Run, run, run, run, run!
Mom!
Run!
Aila!
Run!
Aila!
Aila!
Aila, no!
No!
- Another kid.
- Yeah.
- Another kid.
- Yeah. We have to...
Aila.
Aila.
I know where Simon's going.
He's going to a place called Verdansk.
He said he wouldn't be happy
if he stayed here.
That his family was broken.
So he's not in Kiruna?
Yes, he is.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
Mom and I are both here for you.
I'll be right back.
Are you okay?
No.
Thank you for saving Mica.
I'll be forever grateful
that you did that for us.
Always.
Can I see that?
I heard
that he got crushed in Verdansk.
What are you talking about?
Where's Verdansk?
Where is Verdansk?
Death war zone,
COD.
Call of Duty.
The video game.
Simon is...
having a gaming lock-in with his friends
at the school.
But how could they? The school's closed.
It's a
going-away LAN party.
What'd you do that for?
It's my family.
You can't just...
You can't just...
I... I can't. I have to...
- Let go.
- Give it back.
Let go!
Give it back!
- Stop them.
- Give it back!
- Stop it!
- Give it back!
Let go of me!
Give it back!
- Give it back!
- The hell are you doing?
- Give it back!
- Oh my God!
- What are you doing?
- Mom!
- Give it back!
- Mom!
Mom!
- Give it back!
- Stop it! Stop it, both of you!
Get up!
I know where Simon is.
- Where?
- Where is he?
Frigga!
Where... where are we going?
Hampus!
HJALMAR LUNDBOHM SCHOOL
Hampus. Hey. Hey. Have you seen Simon?
- I've gotta call my dad.
- Have you seen Simon?
- My dad can fix this.
- Hey.
- My dad can...
- We'll help him after we find Simon.
He's not going anywhere.
Let's go! Hurry up!
- Do you know where he is?
- She said they'd been gaming.
Any idea, Mica?
The computer room's
on the other side of the cafeteria.
Simon!
- Simon!
- Simon?
We can't go any further.
- Wait.
- Wait. Listen.
Don't, Mica.
It's Astrid.
Help!
Over here!
- Simon!
- Frigga, wait!
We're gonna be buried alive
if we go in there.
Simon could be in there.
You stay here if you want to.
No, just wait! Just wait.
I'll go first.
Watch the cable.
What are the chances
there will be more tremors?
High.
It's impossible
to get through here.
The air vents?
Could that work?
Not for the two of us.
I've gotta get some rope.
- Let me go!
- Mica!
Mica. Mica.
We need a rope to get you in there.
You're not going in there.
You're not going in there. Hey, hey. Hey.
Mica...
I know that I told you...
I know I told you that need to find Simon,
but leave it to me now.
- Okay.
- I've got this.
You don't need to. Come here.
Mica? Mica, I need you.
- Could you help me with something?
- Mm.
Come on.
- I'm sorry about, uh...
- Thought you were giving Dabir a chance.
I...
I thanked him for-for
saving Mica.
- It went well, at first, but then...
- "It went well."
Must have been fucking perfect.
Simon said that you didn't really
want him to live with me, so I, um...
I told him that maybe you're right
and that he should keep living with you.
You said that?
Yeah.
I was more worried
about you than about him.
I'm so fucking stupid.
He probably hates me now.
He hates me more.
You're right. We had a fight.
I was throwing stuff...
Get away from there!
We can't keep going.
We gotta get out!
- Let's go!
- Here!
Let's get out now. Come on, Frigga!
- Frigga!
- Frigga!
Frigga!
- Mom!
- Frigga!
Frigga!
Can you hear us?
I'm okay.
Okay, stay there.
Stay right where you are, Frigga.
I'm okay.
Let go, or I'll just untie myself.
Come on.
Help me.
Hello?
Help me! Help!
Over here.
Oh God.
I need help. I can't move.
- Is that you, Tina?
- Of course it's me.
Mom?
- Simon?
- Mom!
Simon!
Simon?
I'm here.
- Fucking...
- In the corner.
- Simon!
- Here. Mom.
- Are you okay?
- Mm.
- Stay there. I'll come help you.
- Help me first.
Something's wrong with my back.
I don't un... How...
You're here?
Where else would I be?
Martin and Astrid, are they...
They're dead.
- Did you hear me? Dead!
- Be quiet!
Be quiet.
- I'll help both of you.
- Can you help us now, please?
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Simon! Simon?
Simon! Simon!
Simon?
Simon!
Simon!
I don't wanna die now.
Okay.
Okay.
- I need help! Why are you sitting there?
- Okay...
Calm down.
Calm down. I'll help both of you.
Give me your jacket.
Okay.
- Hurry up! What are you doing?
- One second.
Careful.
Hold the wire.
Hang on, Mica.
- Frigga?
- Mom.
- Yeah?
- Frigga!
Right here.
- I found Simon.
- Dad!
- You found Simon?
- Careful, the floor. The floor's cracking.
- Careful, Mica. Careful, Mica!
- Simon!
Watch out. He's right there.
- Yeah, okay.
- Here! Dad!
There's a big sinkhole
right underneath us.
- Mica!
- Careful!
Simon?
- Where are you?
- Here! Mica!
Are you okay?
Mi...
Mica? Can you help me?
- Tina.
- Tina, don't worry.
Don't worry, Tina.
I'm gonna try to pull you over here.
- Can we pull her over?
- The floor isn't gonna support you both.
What the hell are you doing, Mom?
Relax, Mica. Grab on to this.
Here. Get ready.
Take it. Try to grab on.
Grab it!
Grab it, Tina. Grab...
No! Stop!
Watch out.
Simon!
Don't move!
Tina?
Tina?
You sure about this?
I'd never forgive myself
if something happened.
I have to get down there.
Mica, take it easy.
See ya later.
Be careful now.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Mom!
Don't move, don't move!
- I'm gonna try to swing to you.
- Yeah.
- Mom. Mom, I have to get outta here...
- Stay still.
Do exactly as your mom says, okay?
And happy birthday.
Give me more rope.
- Okay.
- Come on.
A little more.
Stop.
I'll try to swing over to you.
- Ready?
- Yup.
Huh.
Look out!
What happened?
Frigga?
- I'm stuck!
- Frigga!
On a rebar, or something.
- Tage, hold on.
- Yeah.
Fuck.
Don't try to pull it out,
or you'll bleed out!
What the fuck?
Watch out!
Do something, or we'll all get crushed!
We need to stabilize the floor
with more wire.
- I know where it is. Are you holding?
- Yeah, yeah.
Simon.
Stay there. We'll be right there.
Pull. Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, Tage! Pull!
- Gotta stabilize the floor first. Hold on!
- Yeah.
- It's stable here.
- Up here, Tage.
Here. Give me the rope. Easy!
- Grab this. Hold on tight.
- Okay. Yeah.
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.
Hold on tight.
Okay. What should I do?
How?
Okay. Okay.
- Up here, Tage.
- All right.
Mom? Hello?
This way. We have to secure it. Okay?
All right, pull, Tage. Pull, Tage!
Back up, back up, back up!
- We need help, right now!
- Almost there, Frigga! Almost there!
There you go.
Mom? Mom. Mom!
Mom?
More, more, more, more, more.
The new guy up there, is that...
- One more time.
- That's Dabir.
Dabir? Dabir.
- Okay. Is he...
- Listen.
If you don't like him, then he's out.
- Hold on! Hold on!
- You're way more important.
- It's that easy for you, is it?
- Sorry. I didn't mean to laugh it off.
Tage!
- Does it seem stable?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I just want you to be happy.
I was planning on leaving.
What would I do
if you left Kiruna?
- I love you, sweetie.
- Hold on tight.
We were acting like idiots.
- Grab on, and pull.
- Of course you can live with him.
It's not really about that. No, I...
I just wanna get back to our old lives.
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.
I don't.
I understand.
Things don't always work out.
Around one more time.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Frigga, look out!
- Whoa!
- Mom!
Are you guys okay?
Are you hurt?
- Are you okay? Are you okay?!
- We're okay, but Mom's bleeding!
Give me that. Tie a knot. Grab it.
What's going on? What's happening?
The edge is crumbling.
Don't jump, please. Don't jump!
Don't jump, Simon!
Thank you.
Give it here. Tage.
I have to tie it.
Dad, can you take over?
I can't hold on any longer!
No! Hey!
- Mica!
- Mica! No!
- What are you doing?
- Mica!
Fuck!
- Fuck, fuck!
- Mica! Fuck!
Mica!
Okay, okay. Okay.
- Fucking hell, Mom.
- What are you doing?
- Don't talk. Save energy.
- What's the plan?
- Have you got it?
- Yes!
- We have to get down there.
- We're all gonna die if we go down.
But that's my family down there.
We're going to get them up, but safely.
Help me out now.
Okay, all done. Okay.
This is gonna...
This is gonna hurt like hell, Mom.
Okay. Okay.
One, two, three.
Grab her, grab her, grab her!
We have to get up!
Yeah!
- Okay.
- Down, down, down!
- Okay. Mom?
- Mom?
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?
You're okay.
Mom?
Okay.
Mom?
She needs air. Let's get this off her.
It's okay.
- Okay, sweetie. Get up there now.
- There.
- You ready?
- Okay.
- He's ready.
- That's my family down there.
- Okay, sweetie?
- Yep.
Come on.
- Almost there.
- Come on.
Oh!
I'm so glad to see you.
Hurry up!
The edge is crumbling!
- The hell are you doing?
- The edge is crumbling!
- Mica!
- Okay.
We gotta jump. We gotta jump.
- I can't jump with this leg.
- But it's not that far. It's not that far.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay. It's okay.
- Mica, for fuck's...
- Simon, Simon, Simon, I need this fast.
Stand still, both of you. We're coming.
We're coming, we're coming.
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.
Damn it, it's too heavy!
Fucking hurry up!
- Here.
- Okay. Okay.
Come on!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
Ah, fuck!
- Come on!
- Tage!
You think I'd leave you? Come on!
- Okay.
- Come on!
Come on!
Fuck.
Come on, Mica! Almost there!
- Hold on tight! Hold on tight!
- Careful!
There we go.
- You okay, Dad?
- Get them out!
Come on!
There, there!
- Right here! Hang on tight!
- Almost there! Come on!
You've got me!
- Get Frigga up now!
- Come on, Frigga!
It's gonna be okay.
Everything will be fine.
I love you guys.
Ah!
No! Dad!
Fuck!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
Stay with me. Stay with me.
- Dad, come on.
- Tage?
Stay. Stay!
Stay!
- Stay! No!
- Simon. Simon!
- Simon! Simon.
- No!
Hold his head.
Look after my kids.
Please, Dabir,
look after my...
Dad, stay with us.
Look after them.
- Hello? Hey.
- Tage, come on.
Dad. Dad.
Dad.
- What happened?
- He got electrocuted.
It just happened.
No.
No.
Dad. Dad.
Dad. Dad.
Dad.
Dad. Wake up, Dad.
THE ABYSS
