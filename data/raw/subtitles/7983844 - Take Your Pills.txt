[Ariana] I take it right when I wake up.
I keep it next to my toothbrush
so I remember to take it.
Takes about 40 minutes to kick in
and you can feel it.
I start to sweat.
My heart accelerates very rapidly.
[clapping sound]
[Blue] The fives get you through the day
a little faster.
But if it's Monday,
sometimes you take ten.
[Matthew] From there,
this wave of happiness
hit me that was like a warm glow.
[Delaney] Suddenly, I could pay attention
and my handwriting got neater.
I thought that was so cool.
[Eben] My mind came alive,
my body felt alive.
When it works, it works like a bang.
[man] Suddenly, you are in a room
with 10,000 doors
and behind a bunch of the doors
is some cool stuff.
You are gonna wanna try and run
as fast as possible
and stay awake as long as possible,
to look in all the doors.
[interviewer] What did Adderall do for you
when you were playing the game?
[Jasper] Laser-like focus,
reaction time increased, alert.
[Leigh] The first week I took it,
I was like, "I like this. This is good."
[Nathanael] Adderall. Warning,
side effects may include
being awesome at everything.
[Blue] It's like
the New York Stock Exchange ticker.
That's what my mind looks like
all the time.
When I take Adderall,
it's like the ticker slows down.
[Jasper] I can zone in on something
and completely ignore everything.
[Peter] Every investment banker
hears about the heyday of cocaine
and doing it off their desks
and doing it off strippers,
and that's not how it is with Adderall.
-Who takes Adderall anymore?
-[Carver] Half the kids in Palo Alto.
-[Ariana] You name it, I've tried it.
-[Regina] Adderall.
[Ariana] Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall,
Vyvanse, Focalin.
[Brigid Polk] Amphetamine...
[Fadiman] The idea that children
were given amphetamine in the '60s
would have appalled everyone.
From now on, it's nothing but fresh air,
lots of hugs
and good old-fashioned Ritalin.
[Delaney] I am Adderall.
I'm never not on it.
I would never think of something as me
not being on Adderall.
[techno music playing]
This is the most ridiculous bathroom
in the entire world.
Everyone has their own starter pack.
It's like a little telling of y'all are.
"Free the nipple."
Jews 'cause I'm Jewish.
"New Jersey" 'cause I tell people
I'm from New York, but I'm not.
I'm from New Jersey.
So that's a running joke.
And a Jew smoking weed through a menorah.
This is my favorite thing in here.
Every time we go out,
we take something home with us.
So, my parents,
right before I left to school, were like,
"We need to get you a lockbox."
And I was like, "Why?"
They were like, "For your pills."
I was like, "What do you mean, a lockbox?
Who's gonna take my pills?"
It's Rx gold.
People will take it from you
if they know you have it.
I don't think I know anyone
that is prescribed it
that doesn't sell a little on the side.
That's a big thing here
'cause it's a hard school,
so a lot of people are on Adderall.
Why would anyone
wanna put this in their body?
[Ariana] This is trazodone.
This is Ativan, for my panic attacks.
Then when I got here, I was like,
"Holy shit. Everybody takes Adderall.
Everyone."
[Jasper] That's an empty one.
[Leigh] I've openly seen people in classes
take out their bottle
and hand off pills
to someone next to them.
"Anyone have Addie I could buy?
Please. Please."
[chuckling]
Sometimes I forget that it's illegal.
There's a public Facebook group,
like a classifieds,
buying and selling anything.
And people will post in there
that they're selling 20 XR Adderall,
and not think that they are drug dealing
in a public forum.
My mom didn't hide it, but I hide it.
Adderall and Instagram are hand in hand
in being the perfect student.
[Delaney] You wanna be beautiful
and skinny,
and you wanna have amazing grades,
and then you also wanna be able to go out,
and Adderall just sews it all up for you.
You've got instant release versus
extended release.
People will take it and sit down
at the little cubicles in the library.
They lay out everything,
that way you can't be distracted
by anything else.
And you have a set playlist,
and people will put in their ear buds,
and you're ready to roll.
[Brown] At the simplest level,
the norms that I would say
are driving use
of performance enhancing drugs
are those that simply tell us,
"Your task is to concentrate,
to perform at the highest capacity
that you possibly can,
and to do it for as long as it takes."
Whether it's at an investment bank,
or whether it's a homework assignment,
the question is,
"How can you come out on top?"
[Leigh] Obviously, if you're presented
with something
that will maximize the good things
in your life,
you'll get everything you can out of it.
Of course you're gonna want it.
I was talking to someone about this
and they're like,
"Isn't it the same thing
as having a good breakfast before an exam
and drinking a cup of coffee?
Why is medication the thing
that's so immoral or unethical
about getting an edge over everyone else?"
Let's see. I'm taking five classes.
So if I get a 90 on the paper,
an 82 on the exam today,
I'll get an 89.77.
So that's not gonna fly,
unless she rounds up.
So, let's say an 83,
but it's also a pride thing.
I'd like to finish strong,
stronger than I started.
Adderall, for me, has always been
like when you're desperate and hopeless,
and you're like, "I need this right now
because I need to be my best,
smartest, fastest self."
[Brown] The problem today
isn't that jobs are scarcer,
or that positions in schools are fewer.
It's that we live
in a hypercompetitive order,
where the competition
is not just for arriving,
but the competition is never-ending.
Every human being is now required
to understand themselves
as a little bit of human capital.
Parents are terribly concerned,
from before the moment
that their children are born,
about what that human capital value
will be in their child,
and are tending it with everything
from Mozart in the womb
to positions in preschools
and access to certain kinds of sports
and certain kinds of curriculums.
The anxiety about the human capital value
that their children are able to develop
leads, I think,
almost inexorably toward Adderall,
either offered by the parents
or offered to peers by one another
once they hit high school and college.
I sometimes joke about how
when I was in college,
people did drugs to check out.
And now people do drugs to check in.
And that says something
about our culture right now.
[interviewer] What do you think it says?
It makes me kind of depressed.
[laughing]
We probably have meds for that.
I had tons of friends in high school
that were on Adderall,
and because they were on Adderall
or Vyvanse or something like that,
were getting two and a half time
on the SATs or something,
and got to take it alone. And I wanted it.
I had three straight days
with this psychiatrist.
I remember the testing
was so stressful for me
'cause it's made to make you feel dumb
and feel like you can't complete
these tasks that other people can.
That was the first time I was like,
"I might really need this."
ADD is a condition where people have more
trouble focusing with their attention.
People typically are distractible.
Because there aren't clear-cut boundaries,
it becomes fuzzy of what do you treat
and what do you not treat.
[Leigh] I got diagnosed
by the psychiatrist,
and I was thrilled
because I had the SAT in a couple months.
I had never tried it,
but the first week that I took it,
I was like,
"I like this. This is good."
I remember I was concerned about
not feeling entirely myself,
too zoned and I didn't feel
as funny as usual.
I remember saying that.
But you had to pick and choose,
and I wanted to pick getting good grades
and doing well on the SAT.
[Schwarz] The desire to do better
is pretty universal.
People like succeeding.
People like not letting others down.
So, what you've seen is that
every generation has found a different way
to try to enhance their performance.
Now in this case, a lot of the time,
it has been what we now call ADHD drugs.
[newscaster] In the high pressure
rat race of academic achievement,
there is one fix students are turning to
at an alarming rate to get ahead.
[interviewer] And how are you doing that?
[man] Adderall.
I've never gotten a B in my life.
[reporter] Some students
are calling it college crack.

The first article about college abuse
of amphetamine to study
was in Time magazine in 1937.
This ain't new.
[Rasmussen] In the early days,
they called it the pep-pill.
Pep is what Americans want.
It's about drive, ambition,
being productive and hardworking,
and making the sale,
and getting the job done.
[man] Kellogg's Pep sure is
a treat to eat.
[Rasmussen] So, Dr. Gordon Alles
was a young biochemist
trying to create an allergy medicine.
And that's how, in 1929,
he happened to synthesize the drug
we now call amphetamine.
He injected himself
with 50 milligrams of the salt,
which is quite a high dose.
And his lab notes
are absolutely fascinating.
Within minutes, he's like,
"Strong feeling of well-being."
He's like, "I really like this!"
[Rasmussen] After about an hour,
Alles noted,
"Feeling of well-being, palpitation,
rather sleepless night,
mind seemed to race
from one subject to another."
This is the record
of the first amphetamine experience,
Alles' self-experiment in June, 1929.
It's very clear that from the beginning,
this amphetamine product was a compound,
a chemical that needed a medical use.
[Schwarz] It didn't take long
for amphetamine
to become a prescription medication.
In the mid-1930s, Smith Kline &amp; French
introduced it as Benzedrine.
And you would snort it
and it would clear your sinuses.
The problem is, amphetamine feels
really good to a lot of people,
and it gets them jazzed
and ready to perform.
[Harry Gibson singing]

[Rasmussen] When World War II broke out,
military doctors in Germany
tried it on some military cadets.
Of course, the students liked it.
The British found these pills
in downed German planes.
They seemed to be acting like supermen,
and maybe it was drugs
that were making them supermen.
The American military,
when they saw that the British were
approving the drug and introducing it,
they hurried along the studies
and took it on, too.
Just a cup of coffee.
Really, Mr. Holden,
a hardworking executive like you
should have a hot lunch.
Very well. Just scramble me
a couple of Benzedrine tablets.
[Rasmussen] Benzedrine took off
after the war
as a general practice antidepressant.
So did Dexedrine.
Among its uses was weight control.
Also, painful menstruation,
what we'd call PMD, was tested.
This is a funny trial.
The doctor who was running it
was working at a factory
where all the assembly line workers
were women.
The subjects were requesting more of it,
but it turned out that the demand
had nothing to do
with their actual menstrual cycle.
They just liked taking the drugs.
Spot on.
[man] One, two...
[Rasmussen] Amphetamine inhalers became
a kind of a staple in jazz culture,
particularly in the bebop circles.
Charlie Parker was certainly
a regular user.
Some of the people
that are later remembered
as the important beat writers,
like Jack Kerouac,
were going to these jazz clubs.
Kerouac really admired
the way bebop sounded
and he wanted to model his own writing
after this very spontaneous,
free rush of sound.
"Come on, boy, go thou across the ground.
Go moan for man. Go moan, go groan."
[Rasmussen] When he discovered
the amphetamine inhaler,
he really took to it and used it
as an aid for his writing for a long time.
It was normal to have amphetamine
when you wanted it.
Most people probably just got it
by asking for a prescription
from their family practitioner.
Turn around and drop your pants.
This goes in the gluteus.
What is it?
It's an energy serum.
Max Jacobson, who's known as Dr. Feelgood
by many of his patients,
was one of these speed doctors.
For a time,
he was John F. Kennedy's favorite doctor.
[Don Draper] What does it do?
24 to 72 hours of uninterrupted
creative focus, energy and confidence.
Really?
And if you listen to The Beatles,
the song "Doctor Robert"
is about a doctor in New York
who'd freely prescribe amphetamine
to rock stars and celebrities
who wanted it.
[The Beatles singing]
♪ Well, well, well, you're feeling fine ♪
[Rasmussen] The '60s were called
the go-go years for a number of reasons.
And that's the way Andy Warhol
experienced the early '60s,
up on amphetamine all the time.
Not just him, his whole scene.
Whoo!
And let me see,
the right side or the left side?
Oh, well, you never...
Doesn't matter if you get
the left or the right, or go drop dead.
Ding!
[Schwarz] A lot of women, and men,
don't get me wrong,
soldiers in Vietnam,
got horribly addicted.
That's why we have
the Controlled Substances Act.
[Frank Zappa] Hi, wanna die?
Start today, use a little speed,
you've got five years.
Rot your mind, rot your heart,
rot your kidneys, cucaracha.
[announcer] A public service announcement
of the Do It Now Foundation.
[Rasmussen] By the height
of the pharmaceutical speed epidemic,
50 pills per man, woman and child per year
were being manufactured
by US pharmaceutical firms.
The ingredients are essentially
the same as what's used
for attention deficit today,
including Adderall.
[trippy music playing]
Adderall is a performance enhancer, yes.
[laughing]
Um, and I don't think
there's anything wrong with that.
[Nathanael] When you hit the sweet spot
with Adderall, it's like a Zen flow.
Everything quiet, you're quiet,
and things are just there, and so are you,
and then you just do what you need to do.
I have an electric unicycle.
I'm riding like I do every day.
I think I was going to Home Depot.
Somebody leans out of the car window
and goes, "Fuck you, techie."
Only in the Bay Area would that happen.
It was weird 'cause they just assumed
since I was on an electric unicycle
that I must be in tech.
There is an archetype in tech
of a person who,
in most cases, doesn't exist,
and he works 16 hours a day, every day,
and the code just comes out of him.
And just flawlessly from start to finish,
it's just Mozart on the screen.
And everybody wants to be that person.
I did, and I'm sure
some part of me still does.
We all want to be awesome
at the things that we're trying to do.
And then you throw Adderall into the mix,
and that lets you be the person
that's there till midnight or 1:00.
[Eben] Let's go!
You guys know the drill.
Give me a good base, a good knee bend.
Pull that belly button to your spine,
tighten that core up.
The thing with football is
you have to love it.
It's way too hard on your body,
and your mind, really.
Go! Keep pushing it.
[announcer 1] Eben Britton, right here,
a lot people are saying
that may be the best offensive tackle
in the country.
[announcer 2] Arizona
has won their home opener.
[Eben] There's nothing
that can describe that.
That was the biggest win
we've had in a long time.
You don't make it
to Division I football, period,
if you can't push yourself
to superhuman feats.
And then to make it to the NFL,
that's like a 0.1% of every kid
that's ever picked up a football.
[Eben] I don't know
if there's a way to get to perfect,
but that's what you're always looking for.
[Brit] I miss the rookie season.
That was the drama-free, happy season.
[Eben] Yeah.
Man, I was kicking ass.
I'm healthy, I'm strong, I'm quick.
I'm just building on the success
that I had in my rookie year.
And we're in a workout,
and we're doing squats,
and I went down,
and I just feel this squirting.
It's like a tube of toothpaste,
somebody just went like...
We started doing tests, and it's like,
"Shit, it's a herniated disc. Clearly."
Come on, don't step on those.
I come back to training camp
and the coaches were like,
"Dude, what the fuck happened to you?"
It doesn't matter if you're hurt or not.
Every guy is hurt.
It's, "Can you get out there and play?"
Because there's always somebody
coming behind you to take your job.
This Monday night game,
I was at this breaking point
of exhaustion and frustration,
and one of our teammates was like,
"I got Adderall."
I took them,
and I just felt jolted back to life.
I felt this surge of energy
rush through me.
My mind came alive. My body felt alive.
I felt like I was able
to get a jump on the snap count,
and I was able to react faster
than guys were,
and I could see things
that were happening,
like, corners blitzing...
A stimulant is a drug
that stimulates people.
It makes you feel more up
and awake and alert.
And they also increase euphoria.
All of those things are very positive.
That's why people have their caffeine
in the morning.
[Diller] So there's two main groups
of stimulants.
There's amphetamine and methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate is the major constituent
of Ritalin and Concerta,
two drugs that are very, very widely used.
And amphetamine
is the major constituent of Adderall.
This whole class of medications
that we think of stimulants
work on the catecholamine system
in the brain.
And there are two parts
of the catecholamine system.
One is called norepinephrine,
or colloquially sometimes
people think about that
as noradrenaline or adrenaline.
And the other is dopamine.
And what these drugs
typically do in the brain is,
they either enhance
the release of catecholamines
or they block its reuptake.
[Hinshaw] They increase reaction time,
they probably increase
some tolerance to pain
during the intensity
of athletic competition.
[Diller] Low doses of amphetamine
or amphetamine-like drugs
get anyone who takes it, child or adult,
to become more deliberate
and more methodical.
They will tend to stick with things longer
that are not of interest or are boring.
Adderall had this
holistic enhancing effect
to my life at that time.
It helped me in the meetings,
film study, game review.
It helped me dealing with the pain.
That was really
what spurned on this thing,
like, "I just have to get access to this,
and I have to do it the right way because
I don't wanna fail a drug test.
I don't wanna do any of that.
But this is something
that can really help me."
[Hinshaw] If you are a
professional athlete in the United States,
you can't take stimulants unless you have
what's called an exemption.
And a doctor must certify
that you legitimately have ADHD
and the stimulants
aren't just performance enhancers,
but they're part of your medication.
[Eben] I wasn't even that big then.
I was so happy because it was so obvious
that he took it one day,
and then that night,
he was doing exactly
what I had been wanting him to do.
Right away, I'd take the trash out
or I'd do the dishes.
And I organized my DVD collection
by director, alphabetically.
And I think I even called my mom
and told her,
"This is so great.
Eb's been diagnosed with ADD
and he's doing the dishes."
And I was like, "This is really good.
I'm making her happy.
I'm not coming home
and just crashing on the couch."
[Nathanael] The very first time
I took Adderall,
I had ADHD symptoms
and I went to see a military doctor,
and I got a prescription.
I really didn't like it.
It made me more focused on my distractions
rather than more focused
on what I was supposed to be doing.
And so I didn't take it again
until this year.
I was doing a really intensive
programming boot camp.
Someone offered it to me,
and it was 1:00 in the morning.
I was like, "I've had a prescription,
so I don't feel too bad about this."
I took him up on it and it really helped.
It was definitely jet fuel. Yeah.
I didn't need much at all.
I'd take five or ten milligrams a day.
Problems that were previously
really exhausting,
or maybe seemed insurmountable,
were interesting challenges.
I had the discipline to tear myself
away from work,
come home at 11:00, and in ten minutes,
just like, protein shake,
brush teeth, go to bed.
And then I went, "Adderall.
Warning, side effects may include
being awesome at everything."
And that's how it felt.
I'm sure for a lot of people,
they would say, or believe,
or it might be true,
that they're just trying to be
the best programmers they can be.
But for most people,
I think the end goal is money.
[cell phone ringing]
Hello. Thank you.
All right, cool. Later.
The best description
of the first time I took Adderall
is kind of like somebody
pulls back the curtain,
and now you're able to focus
on each person in the audience.
Okay, tell her Blue called.
Adderall definitely helps you
be a better capitalist.
When I'm on my Adderall,
I'm here to solve problems.
What's the problem?
Line 'em up, I knock 'em down.
[woman] She said 175.
[Blue] Let me tell 'em.
I've been blessed to work with
Outkast and CeeLo Green, Nick Cannon.
As a manager,
you deal with so many different people.
I deal with the business managers,
the label, the accountants,
the tour agents.
When you're on your Adderall,
it is easier to keep track of people
and to call those people back
'cause you don't forget.
Yo, Mario, it's Blue calling you back.
When you're not on it, people,
you get to 'em when you get to 'em.
You're just mad 'cause
the good managers are from New York.
We're gonna get to work
on this PowerPoint slide
for the Wild 'n Out Summer Pool Parties.
The deal I'm cutting is,
any sponsorships we bring in,
we can split with the hotel.
[woman] Is there a deadline?
[Blue] It's Monday.
Wednesday would be the ideal time.
If this was Puff, he'd want it Wednesday.
Morning, when I get back from Chicago,
I want that deck.
-[woman] With his cheesecake.
-Thank you.
In high school, the only reason
why I really knew Adderall
was because my siblings
were prescribed it.
But no one took it to study,
no one took it to party.
It's so hard,
minus all the ethical implications,
but knowing that it's out there
and it's so easy
and you're just ignoring that,
you're ignoring.
You'll take the B when you know
you could have gotten an A
just by popping a $2 pill,
if you're gonna buy.
You also aren't worried
about getting in trouble for it
because you're just a kid
with a learning disability.
You're not a drug...
You didn't purchase drugs illegally.
I can see a lot of people
that are concerned about buying
or selling illegal drugs.
Like, that would be just the same
as them buying heroin.
They can process that.
But for a ton of people like us,
you would never be scared
of getting caught by a campus police,
or your professor would tell someone,
'cause it's really not thought of
as a drug in your mind.
[Delaney] I forgot to take
my morning meds today.
Not Adderall. Nope. It can be unfair.
I have a weird relationship
with the way that I think about it,
because I was surrounded by people
that had a lot more money than I did.
I had to work in high school,
and I couldn't afford private tutors
for classes.
So, on one hand, I feel like,
if you were someone like me,
using Adderall could have been
leveling out the playing field.
But on the other hand,
if you're someone like some of those kids,
then you're just giving yourself
even more of a leg-up.
I'm from the Midwest,
from a place that has a lot
of problems with meth.
You see all this stuff on the news,
and the juxtaposition between
the meth-head
that lives in the trailer park
that we learned about in D.A.R.E.,
versus the kids whose parents make
well over six figures a year.
They're both tweaking out,
if you think about it.
Just like opiate painkillers
are heroin in a pill,
ADHD medicine is a small dose
of meth in a pill.
When we think about methamphetamine
from a chemical perspective,
and we think about amphetamine,
the active ingredient in Adderall,
the only difference between these drugs
is an additional methyl group
on the methamphetamine compound.
Methamphetamine is legal
in the United States for prescription.
It's a Schedule II drug,
just like Adderall is a Schedule II drug.
But people don't prescribe it as much
because of the public hysteria
surrounding illicit methamphetamine.
[officer] We got a search warrant.
They said meth would help me
get through my exams.
[Hart] So we think about people
who have meth labs,
we think about people
who are living in rural America,
all within a negative context.
Then, we contrast that
with another amphetamine
that has similar effects.
[woman] Girls, time for your Adderall.
What time did you guys
get home last night?
Uh, late.
We oftentimes think of that
in a different context.
We think about people
who have prescriptions for Adderall,
we think about college students,
we think about people in our society
who we like.
I just ended up accidentally taking,
like, six Adderall.
I stayed up all night,
I did a real deep dive into
Ryan Dillon Davidson's Facebook page,
and I found some shit.
Wealthier kids have access
to purified pharmaceutical speed,
and other communities have access to meth.
You know, cooked meth.
Although the potency is definitely greater
in crystal meth, in smoking it, etcetera,
at the neuroreceptor sites,
it has the exact same effects.
[Leigh] I'm surrounded
by very privileged people.
These are wealthy people in America.
We have the money to get tested,
the resources to afford being medicated
every day of your life,
where you can maximize everything.
Even negotiating the healthcare system
and finding the right doctors
is also a matter of privilege, right?
Some people know how to do it
and a lot of people don't.
If you have the right connections,
if you know who to go see,
I think that also becomes easier to do.
Adderall is perfect
for finance work and any type of work
where you have to be detail-oriented,
which is what finance work is.
While I was at Goldman,
I never told anybody
that wasn't under the age of 25.
You had to feel it out before
you would ever reveal you took Adderall.
And I think there is this fear that,
if you reveal it,
then, A, they've never heard of it,
they don't get it.
And B, they'll view you as weaker,
as inferior,
and they may view you as somebody
that can't keep up.
When getting it from my friends
became expensive,
I decided it was time
to find a doctor in New York.
So, all I did was send a text
to a few friends.
So I ended up going to Central Park South,
and it was a fancy office,
and it was a nice old man.
And I think once he heard
I work for Goldman Sachs,
he was like, "Okay, cool.
He's normal, he'll be fine.
He's a version of my idea of successful.
I can write him
whatever prescription he needs."
I probably have six or seven friends
that go to him currently.
There was a great line in a comedy,
Silicon Valley,
when one of the tech workers
needed Adderall and couldn't find it,
and the line was,
"Just go out on the street on a bicycle.
Half the kids in Palo Alto are taking it."
Hey.
Any of you guys currently on Adderall
and, you know, want to make $50?
This is the generation
beginning in the mid-'90s
that was widely exposed to the use
of Adderall and Ritalin and Concerta,
amongst their peers.

-I'm afraid I'll have to expel your son.
-[gasps]
Unless you're willing to try a radical,
untested, potentially dangerous--
-Candy bar?
-No. It's a new drug called Focusyn.
A drug?
[Jasper] I learned about ADD
after being on the medication,
so, I didn't know what it was.
All I knew was it was for school.
It was always just about
being easier on the teachers
and being easier on my parents
and just being not as loud.
And, I guess, focusing.
But I never had interest in school,
and I focused in, always,
what I wanted to focus in.
And that was art and, I guess,
reading when I could read,
which took some time.
All right. Let's see, man.
How's everything? How's the art?
Good. I got to get ready
to do my senior show this year show.
So I'm going to be keeping
really, really busy.
-How's it going with your medicines?
-Good.
Still taking 'em?
Yeah, but not as much.
I take them when I need them.
[doctor] Okay. So sporadically,
like we've done before?
Yeah. And I kind of think
I would like to stop soon.
-Okay. Good.
-Just stop altogether.
Remember we talked about
this is just developmental in the brain,
and as you get more mature,
your brain grows more mature,
those neurons start making connections.
Then you don't need to use them.
[Jasper] Yeah.
I would like to be done with it.
[doctor] Let's see.
-I've had enough since third grade.
-Yeah.
[Jasper] Should I mash these tomatoes?
[Regina] Yeah, I'll help if you want.
[Jasper] Yes. Do it by hand?
Just get in there, yeah.
It says crush them by hand.
You're doing fine.
Go gentle. Gently.
[Jasper] I went to a Montessori school
when I was younger,
along with my sister and cousins.
You wanna start slicing that?
I'll do this.
Sure.
[Jasper] They did well in those schools,
and I didn't.
When he was little, everybody else would
know their alphabet and numbers.
And he couldn't necessarily identify
a number from a letter.
-Sorry.
-That's okay.
So, we had him tested,
and they said that he had ADD.
So we moved him to another school
that really...
A very good school, very good.
[Regina] His third-grade teacher,
halfway through the year,
said something about
him being on medication.
I'm like, "Well, he's not on medication."
And she goes, "Everybody in this class
is on medication."
And I'm like, "He's not."
She goes, "Well, I think that
you might want to try it."
I was only there for two years
before being prescribed Adderall.
[Regina] It was definitely a hard decision
because I was afraid it was gonna hurt
his creativity.
I mean, even at three, you could just see
he had something.
I didn't want to ruin that.
I tried it, and there was a difference
in him that
was just able to concentrate more.
I tested it,
because I wanted to see what it did.
And apparently, I have ADHD, too,
because it worked.
So, it just helps you concentrate.
So do you think I have ADD, or...
We won't know that until the Ritalin helps
this concentration problem.
[Hinshaw] Not so many years ago,
the medical profession thought,
"Wait a minute. I'm not sure
if this kid has ADHD or not.
There's no definitive test. I'll give her
a stimulant and see if it works.
If it works, she has ADHD.
If it doesn't, she doesn't."
Interesting idea, probably wrong.
Most everybody who takes a stimulant
does focus better and longer,
can pull that all-nighter.
[Jasper] I was being forced to take pills.
That's the thing. I'm not doing it
'cause it's fun and stuff.
I'm doing it 'cause I have to.
When I was in 9th grade,
I was taking 50 milligrams a day.
I'd get home from school
still grinding my teeth, still wired.
I'd be up till 6:00 in the morning,
just painting in my room
'cause I'd still be wired from it.
The only difference between
children and adults, as far as I can see,
in the use of these medicines,
is children don't like the higher doses.
As they get higher, they say,
"I feel nervous, I feel weird."
And something happens in mid adolescence,
that the older adolescents
and adults will often say,
"I feel powerful, I feel grand."
[Jasper] I was super embarrassed by it.
When I started going to public school,
it was like, "Yeah, I'm on medicine."
I thought it was funny, just being like,
"I have to take pills to calm down."
I was always yelling upstairs,
"Did you take your pills?"
Or, if he was not listening to me
or behaving badly,
I would also ask that question,
which is probably
more of the annoyance
of why he picked up on that.
[Jasper] That's when I started writing
stuff like "Take your pills."
And trying to force myself
to be proud of the fact that
I can zone in on something
and completely ignore everything.
I started to be proud of it.
Getting up was the obsession.
Just going around with people
and being, "That's me."
[Regina] They're just beautiful.
Everything he does I love.
[Jasper] The paintings don't really go
with the idea of being on Adderall,
except for just being super meticulous
and super correct,
and repeated over and over again.
That's what I found to be the connection
between that and my Adderall,
was just the obsessiveness.
[Ariana] Everyone says this.
For some reason, everyone's like,
"Everyone has a little ADD."
No, that's not true.
We have distractions in our life,
but not everyone has a brain that
functions like somebody's with ADHD.
One of my earliest memories
is being diagnosed.
It's pretty detrimental for people
to constantly be saying things like that,
because it kind of illegitimizes...
Is that a word?
[chuckling] Illegitimizes the struggle
and the actual power that ADHD might have
over somebody's life.
And it is a disorder.
It causes a lot of issues,
and there's a stigma around it.
And I think that people throw it off
like it's nothing and like everyone has
a bit of it, but it's not true.
[Blue] A lot of people out there think
they have it because they can't focus.
But they really can't focus because
society has just taught you not to focus.
We've become this one-minute society.
Everything is about
shortening attention spans anyway.
So, society, overall, now has ADD.
So then, where's the line between
those that actually were born with it,
and those that have grown up
in an ADD society.
I think that's where
we really are right now.
I try and stay out of the pool
during photo shoots.
-Nick looks like he's really struggling.
-Man, a hard day's work.
[laughing] It's a tough life today.
I didn't have medication in mind
when I went to the doctor.
I kind of knew
that I had the signs of ADHD,
just looking at peers, Russell Simmons,
and then I placed myself
somewhere on that spectrum.
I talked to Russell a couple of times.
His answer was,
"I don't take medicine. I do yoga."
And I went to yoga with him.
I was like, "I don't know if this is
gonna get it done for me right now."
Here we go.
[Maxine] We never had a discussion
about his ADD as a child.
I didn't think he needed to have a label.
I think he needed to understand
that he needed coping skills.
She never took me to a doctor
to even consider medication.
She wanted me to learn how to function
within the confines
of what I was
and who I was going to grow up to be.
Shit, am I in the shot again?
Am I in the shot again? My bad.
Having been a special ed teacher,
I've watched, to me,
systemic administration of drugs
to little black boys.
I know upon viewing that,
I really did not want to...
I must say black and Hispanic little boys.
I knew that I did not want that
for my child.
So it was not a happy moment
when he announced that,
after all those years
of not using medication,
that he felt he needed to do that.
As a kid, I thought of Ritalin
as what you put the crazy kids on.
Not knowing that I, technically,
should I have been on it.
Everyone was to go on Ritalin
and that was the instant cure.
I didn't see it as instant cure,
so I would never agree to it.
Just ran him outside a lot.
[chuckling]
Ritalin started as a love story.
A scientist in Switzerland
was fiddling around with compounds
and things that were close to amphetamine.
He came up with something he thought
might help his wife be more peppy,
play better tennis, literally,
and maybe keep her weight down.
He was like,
"There's really something to this."
Her name, Marguerite.
She was actually known as Rita,
and so he named it Ritaline.
And it was only after Ciba,
the Swiss company, put it on the market,
that they took off the '"E,"
and we now know it forever as Ritalin.
[Conners] In the beginning,
we were completely enamored
of the short term effect.
There's nothing so gratifying
as to have the parent come
the day after you first give a pill
and say, you know, "I can't believe it.
He's actually... He's normal.
He's a likable kid now."
Oh, you're such a good girl.
[Schwarz] Keith Conners was
a seminal figure in the history of ADHD.
He developed the primary rating scale
that was used by doctors
to help understand
the clinical picture in children.
He worked on behalf of pharmaceutical
companies evaluating new drugs.
Nobody knew anything about all this stuff.
These were difference makers
in mental health.
What these doctors
at Johns Hopkins were doing
was seeing if there was another pill
other than amphetamine,
which had a terrible reputation,
that might help these troubled children.
Now, how are you
going to get methylphenidate?
The only way to get it
is to ask Ciba for it,
the Swiss company that marketed it.
They said, "Hey, Ciba,
can we have a gazillion pills?"
And this oil drum sized barrel
of Ritalin pills
ends up coming to Johns Hopkins
so they can do their trials.
[Conners] In those days it was possible
to go to the principal and say,
"You know, we're trying out a new drug."
And he'd say, "Oh, my God,
if you could calm these little bastards
down, it would be wonderful."
We arranged a study on the spot
and did a two-week trial.
The children called the pills math pills.
Because, for the first time,
they were able to sit down
and do sums and learn.
The hyperactivity and inability
to pay attention among children,
has been understood for a long time.
That's the way some kids are.
And one of the first names was
Minimal Brain Damage.
They assumed that there
was some sort of damage to the brain.
Either in birth or encephalitis.
It became increasingly clear that
that really wasn't the case.
They said,
"How about minimal brain dysfunction?"
It was only in 1980 that focus began,
if you will,
on the concept of inattention in children.
How about attention deficit disorder.
It had been rebranded as something
that people were willing to accept.
And people were willing
to allow medication for.
[Rasmussen] In 1996, another company
reintroduced, effectively, amphetamine,
same old amphetamine,
for attention deficit
on the US market as Adderall.
And it's grown to absolutely
enormous proportions ever since then.
[psychedelic music playing]
The drug that became Adderall,
its original name was Obetrol.
A pharmaceutical businessman heard
Obetrol was being used occasionally
to treat what was at the time
of course known as ADD.
And he's like, "ADD, all, Adderall."
That's where the name came from.
One of the interesting phenomenas
for me is listening to experts
who were on the ground floor of this.
People like Keith Conners,
now having major questions and regrets
about the outcomes of what they had done.
The medicalizing of everyday life,
that everybody could
potentially have a disorder,
ultimately trivializes the entire process,
and also puts the whole society
in the hands of doctors and Big Pharma.
[interviewer] Would you include yourself
as being in the ADHD business?
Or having been at one point?
I think I was in the ADHD business,
and I wasn't really cognizant
of how much I was in that business.
Uh, there are big bucks
waiting for doctors
who file patients through quickly
and give them prescriptions
without knowing what
the down effects are going to be.
Some of which are good,
but some of which are quite bad.
The United States also
is one of only two developed nations
that allows
the direct to consumer advertising
of controlled substances.
So when it came to ADHD drugs,
it wasn't just for children
who are hyperactive,
who can't concentrate in school.
What they wanted to do is
make the mothers more comfortable.
"Oh, my goodness,
my kid now takes out the garbage!
What a wonderful world,
thanks to Adderall XR."
Every mother is going to be
seduced by an ad
that appears to promise
better grades in a pill
and better grades in a diagnosis.
It was grotesque what these companies did
in the pursuit of profit.
[Hebert] Give it up. Hey, man,
thank y'all for coming out.
Good to see you. You all right?
Good to see you.
My name is Dr. Corey Hebert
and I have a lot of stuff going on.
But I am a physician first.
I'm back.
It's me, the doctor for the people.
You got to get rid of your stress.
It's killing you.
Seeing patient to patient
to patient to patient,
at the end of the day,
I've changed 30 people's lives
and maybe their family.
But when I'm in the media, I'm talking
to a million people at one time.
Dr. Corey Hebert is an ER physician
at the LSU Health Sciences Center.
[Hebert] The way a child sees himself
and how a child learns
to cope in the world,
along with his self-esteem and confidence,
is just as important to his success
as his physical health,
because ADHD is a medical problem.
My brother. Good to see you. How you been?
-Good.
-You're looking good.
I'm going to make my patients do well,
and they're going to be successful
with all the tools
that I have in my arsenal.
And that's the bottom line.
I have to do that.
And I know some people say,
"Well, maybe you should not use
medicines as much."
Well, come sit in my chair.
What you must do
is make the correct diagnosis,
not over diagnose and not over medicate.
-Tell me how school's going.
-It's going all right.
"All right"?
What does that mean, "All right"?
Are you making A's, you making B's,
you making C's?
[Sherry] The part I like, he don't talk
to him as if he's his doctor.
He talks to him like he cares.
All the doctors we had, it's go in,
they check everything
and write an appointment.
"We'll see you back here in four weeks."
But with Dr. Hebert, it's not like that.
What about side effects from the medicine?
You been feeling tired?
Tell me what you've been feeling.
-No.
-No.
Stomach ache, headache,
anything like that?
-Headaches. Yeah.
-You get headaches?
How often are you getting them?
He was diagnosed with ADD when he was six.
And I heard all the stigma,
how the medication make the children feel.
For two years, I went
without giving him medication.
We tried therapy and everything,
and nothing would work.
He actually had to repeat kindergarten.
Were you taking your medicine
and then suddenly stopped taking it?
Yeah.
Come on, man, you're killing me.
You're killing me.
When you started taking it again,
you started to get headaches.
-Yeah.
-Okay, I'm glad.
You got to tell me this stuff.
The first set of meds,
I didn't like the way it had him at all.
Wouldn't talk, wouldn't eat,
couldn't sleep.
He already don't say much anyways.
So we got Adderall.
When he first started school,
he was taking it every day
and he had 2.53,
and now his grades are dropping...
'cause he don't take his meds.
But he's at the age where
I won't force him to take it,
'cause he knows the difference,
and he's in high school.
If those are the consequences
he want to deal with, that's on him.
But I don't like the effects
of it sometimes, either.
Y'all good to go.
If a child has ADHD,
we'll do whatever it takes
to get them to the next level.
Whether it be medicine,
therapy or some other intervention.
But something must happen.
[Sherry] I was the first in my family
to graduate from high school.
And I always tell my kids,
"I don't want you to be like me.
I want you to be better than me.
So because I have a master's degree,
then I want you to get a doctorate.
I want to be able to call you Dr. King."
-That's him right there.
-[indistinct shouting]
That's my baby. [chuckles]
When he's not on his meds,
he reacts and does things without
thinking about the consequences.
He knows that he should take them,
it's that he don't like
the side effects to them.
He won't take it Friday
and Saturday or Sunday.
If he takes it Monday,
it slows him down completely,
almost to zombie state.
A lot of his friends
don't have to deal with that.
So it makes him feel like he's not normal.
So he'd just rather not take it.
[whistling]
[interviewer] What was the research
you were able to do about Adderall?
[Regina] I went to the doctor,
we tried one medicine, it didn't work,
and then we tried this
and I saw a difference immediately.
Come into my shop.
[Regina] Did I do research?
Shamefully, no.
[interviewer] But you were acting
on the guidance of...
The psychologist, the doctor,
I guess, his pediatrician.
I guess, the teachers at school.
My sister, whose kid was on Ritalin.
I don't know if I would have done it.
Now, I google how to open a can.
I google everything.
But then, I don't know that I would
even have thought to do that.
[blows]
[Jasper] I got to school
and I stopped taking it so much.
I only take it when I write, really.
This isn't pot and booze.
This is meth
and it's screwing with your liver.
When I was in senior year,
I wasn't allowed to drink or anything
because they were worried
it was shutting down.
My blood work wasn't looking good.
There was too many enzymes or something.
I had to constantly be looking
at my poop to see what color it was.
If that's the case,
then this isn't worth it.
So what do we know about
the safety issues with stimulants?
There are cardiovascular risks.
There's also a risk
of a psychotic episode,
even for people
who don't have a history of psychosis.
There's a risk of addiction, long-term.
People can become dependent
on these drugs,
and that's, you know, a horrible fate.
You wouldn't wish that
on your worst enemy.
[Peter] Whether they realize it or not,
they're banking on the fact
that we take Adderall.
The perfect employee at an investment bank
or the perfect employee at a tech firm
is somebody that doesn't say no.
There is a culture of, "You do stay up
16 hours for seven days straight."
If the kid to your right and the kid
to your left are producing these outputs,
then you should be able to produce them.
But if they are taking Adderall,
then you should probably
be taking Adderall.
I was coming out of a particularly rough
few weeks of work.
I was working with a notorious asshole
on Wall Street.
He had another analyst and myself
working around the clock.
And we were up for two and a half days
doing Adderall.
We present all this work that
we'd been doing to the managing director.
And he flips through it
and immediately starts saying,
"Wait, this isn't what I asked for.
I actually need this, this and this."
I turned to this guy in my impaired state,
and I said,
"Fuck you.
This is exactly what you asked for."
And so the next day, I go into work,
keep my head down low,
and the associate comes over to me.
He goes, "Did you hear
what happened last night?
About two or three hours
after you left the office,
the other analyst that you'd been working
with had a seizure from exhaustion,
and he's in the hospital right now."
I immediately go and call him.
He picks up the phone
and I ask him how he is,
and he says,
"My parents are trying to make me quit.
My parents think that enough is enough.
But can you send me this file?
I'm being asked for it."
[EKG beeping]
[Delaney] When I was in high school,
everyone told me,
"You'll love college.
You'll finally be able to
take classes that you enjoy."
I like business,
but it doesn't feed my soul.
I take it because it's relevant.
Stimulants are generally gonna
help people a lot before they hurt them.
They gave them to pilots in World War II.
It will give you something that you want
in the short term,
and so then you're primed that a pill
is going to give me what I want.
"That medicine helped me study,
and I did much better
than I would have without it.
I'm gonna do it again."
And then, "Now I can't sleep.
Does anybody have anything for sleep?"
People need to understand
that if you abuse the stimulants,
and young people do,
we've had many patients
that is their drug of choice.
They tend to pair them with
something that's a downer, like alcohol.
It's easy to have an alcohol overdose
if you're on stimulants
because you'll be able
to drink a lot more,
and then the stimulants wear off
and you're in a blackout.
People use it for work,
and so they think it's okay.
I have friends
that have gotten to the point
where they can't really do work
without taking Adderall.
You get used to it,
and then you can't do work without it.
You can't be productive.
I've seen that happen to people.
Most people can use amphetamine
without becoming addicted.
But ultimately, too large
a group of people become addicted,
so it becomes unacceptable for the society
to put this much speed out there.
And we're absolutely
in one of those growing waves right now.
Those of us on the front line have been
feeling this for about eight to ten years.
And right at the moment,
the doctor-prescribed opiate abuse
epidemic is taking center stage,
but I'm telling you,
Adderall is right below
the threshold of the opiates.
[interviewer] Did you start to
attribute success to the Adderall?
I really struggled with not,
"Am I cheating?"
But, "Is this really me anymore?"
Should I still feel as good
about accomplishing something
knowing that I took Adderall
and that really helped me
focus on getting it done,
rather than struggling
through my pain or exhaustion.
Especially after I started
getting these injuries.
Dislocated shoulder,
herniated disk in my back,
L5-S1, torn MCL, torn hamstrings,
torn quads, had my bell rung.
Adderall helped lift me out of that.
The problem was,
that really productive feeling,
and feeling like
I'd conquered the world that day,
it would fall off into this black spiral,
into a depression, and into...
It was a crash.
I'd start crashing off of it,
so then I'd take more.
A 70 milligram time release in the morning
and then supplementing
a couple 20 milligrams
in there throughout the day.
That crash doesn't really go away
when you take more.
You spike up and then you're dipping
back down into the crash.
It would be an exhaustion thing.
Like, you're running,
but your body isn't going anywhere.
You start to float away from yourself
in a way.
[Blue] If you're feeling depressed
and you stop taking Adderall,
it can lead to the depression more.
That might just be me.
Sometimes when you're not on it,
it's easy to get into your head
and just get lost in that space.
[Leigh] It bums me out to know
I didn't do it myself.
Me and the Adderall did it.
It's definitely a competition
with yourself.
[Jasper] It was definitely
an identity crisis, coming off of it.
I will say, me being on it
and me being off of it
is like two completely different people.
Like, very different people.
[player 1] Red three!
[player 2] Halfway home.
[Eben] Because it's an amphetamine
and it speeds up your metabolism,
it dries you out,
it dehydrates your muscles and tissue,
so you become more prone to injury.
So that became a real challenge as well,
staying hydrated through the use.
I really believed he had ADD.
It seemed like his was a medical issue
that was being treated.
Whereas any time
I had used Adderall to study
or anyone I knew
had used Adderall to study,
I looked at it as basically, abuse.
Substance abuse.
But I didn't look at it that way
until later,
when I realized how much he was taking.
And then, when I started to also feel like
his sleep was being affected
and he was maybe using other substances
to help him sleep,
I started thinking,
"That's not a great cycle."
[Eben] My prescription for Adderall
and Vyvanse had run out.
And on a day I didn't have it,
I took a Ritalin.
They both treat ADD/ADHD.
That's what I have a therapeutic use
exemption for Adderall for.
"It'll be the same thing.
It should be fine."
So of course the day I took the Ritalin,
I took a drug test, failed it.
They viewed it as
two different compounds, completely.
And I was hit with a four-game suspension.
[George Stephanopoulos] This morning,
America's golden girl targeted.
[announcer] She's just got so much power.
[Stephanopoulos]
The leaked documents reveal
19-year-old Biles tested positive
for methylphenidate.
[reporter] Simone was upfront
about taking the drugs
and was given a therapeutic use exemption
for the medication she takes.
[Stephanopoulos]
And one other decorated Olympian
has grappled with ADHD, Michael Phelps.
But some people are now asking
if those drugs gave her an unfair leg-up
at the Olympics.
[Hinshaw] We've arrived
at the land of controversy.
Should everybody get SAT tutors?
That's enhancing performance,
but only certain families can afford it.
Should everybody drink coffee?
This goes way beyond psychiatry
or clinical psychology.
It goes way beyond mental health.
What's a level playing field?
Stimulants and ADHD
are in the middle of that playing field.
If we play our cards right,
we're going to have to bring ADHD,
mental health stigma,
the use of medications out in the open,
and have a debate
about what kind of performance enhancement
we should allow
and what we value
and don't value in our society.
[Nathanael] Your experience changes a lot,
as you spend time on a medication.
Initially, it was definitely jet fuel.
I didn't need much at all.
I'd take five or ten milligrams a day
and be fine.
There was a lot of optimism, and a lot of
almost obsession with getting things done,
but it was so fun.
And that's not really true anymore.
So now I take 40 a day.
I do things to make that stronger,
as well.
I get up in the morning,
and I have a milky, like, protein shake,
which is a base.
If I were to have a glass of orange juice,
that would be very acidic,
and it would destroy a lot of the Adderall
before I absorbed it.
Brain-hacking is a subset of the larger
biohacking sphere.
Which is, "I wanna biohack myself
and run a mile faster."
Probably the film Limitless
has done more than anything else
to make the public think,
"This is a thing. There are drugs
that can make a person smarter."
Like, "Information is pouring into my head
like Neo in The Matrix."
I know kung fu.
For the last ten years,
there's been a lot of discussion
about cognitive enhancement.
A lot of the discussion has been
about the ethics of it.
Is it cheating?
Or the safety of it.
But everybody seemed to be assuming that,
of course,
it would enhance your cognition.
So we decided to test and find out.
In some very interesting data
from Martha Farah
at University of Pennsylvania's lab,
some of the initial trials had been done
of college students
without any sign of ADHD
taking either stimulants or placebo
and every week, getting measures,
tests of learning.
It was across a huge battery
of different tasks.
In the end,
we found no significant difference
between Adderall and placebo,
except for one question.
"Do you feel that the pill you took today
enhanced your cognition?"
[Hinshaw] So one of the conclusions may be
that stimulants are very good at boosting
your false self-confidence
and how well you're learning.
People think of amphetamines
being smart pills. They're not.
They certainly can help you stay awake
when you should be asleep,
can help you endure a boring task
a lot longer.
But it doesn't add anything new
or cognition.
The single, most universal effect
that amphetamine, Adderall,
has on anyone who takes it,
is a feeling that they're doing better.
That's not a small effect, because
the feeling of doing better at something
improves your motivation
and confidence in doing it.
If you feel good about yourself
and you feel more driven
to do what you wanna do,
one could argue that
that's an enhancement,
even if it's not actually increasing
your IQ in a very concrete sense.
[Lawler] Often, Adderall is an entry point
for people
into finding out that cognitive enhancers
are a thing.
As a millennial male
that went to a great college,
worked at private equity funds
and hedge funds,
it's impossible to avoid stimulants.
Stimulant abuse.
Because our definition of medication
has changed.
It used to be getting over an illness
versus taking advantage of a loophole
to acquire a Schedule II drug.
We had some friends who were on Adderall
for off-label uses
and they weren't getting good results.
They thought that they needed it
to be successful.
We didn't want that,
so we started looking at alternatives
that were over the counter,
without needing to go pretend
to have ADHD.
I just got this vision
of a very simple page.
Just three elements.
A question, a "Yes" button,
and "No, thank you, I'm satisfied."
We can ask, "Do you want great sleep?"
"Yes" or "No, thanks, I'm satisfied."
If they hit "No," it moves on to,
"Do you want more focus?"
If they hit "Yes,"
they go straight to the OptiMind LP.
How can I help you today?
[man on speaker]
What if your brain could do more? It can.
Sometimes people put us in the same boat
as prescription stimulants,
and I hate that because we're not.
We're meant to help healthy people
achieve their purpose.
I don't have ADHD.
I'm a healthy person looking for things
that can help make me
the optimal and ultimate version of me
that I have in my mind.
I think internally,
everybody is looking for that
ultimate next version of themselves.
We started AlternaScript
taking ingredients that had been studied
by the top neuroscience institutes
in the world,
and saying,
"Do any of these actually work?"
And then things started to take off.
One day, all of a sudden,
we're on the front page of VICE News
about how cognitive enhancement pills
are going commercial.
This research is out there.
And now it's just up to entrepreneurs
to put it all together into something
that people can take every day.
[man on speaker]
The mind is a beautiful thing.
Unleash yours.
Matt, anything you'd add?
You said excited and dedicated.
I'd just do one more take
of that first phrase.
And maybe try picking one or the other
just to drive straight through
to the point.
-What about excitacated?
-"Excitacated"?
[laughing]
-Sounds like a new prescription.
-[laughs]
Cognitive enhancement is not going away.
It's the future of the human species.
All of this is inevitable.
The nootropics movement with microdosing,
with using things like modafinil,
people are taking steps
to get to that next level,
whether it's physically or cognitively.
In parts of Silicon Valley now, people are
very interested in micro doses
of LSD and psilocybin
for enhancement purposes.
And in a culture in which
innovation is given such a high priority,
I can imagine ways in which
that might play into
the idea of having
a more expansive view of things
at the same time that you can get
some of the benefits of focus.
[Lily] It's not like a glass of wine
or a joint,
or any way that people use to decompress.
I really see it as a supplement,
as a tool.
So I microdose every four days.
I grind the mushrooms into a powder,
and I put them in capsules
that measure out to 0.2 grams.
Microdose is about a tenth to a twentieth
of a conventional dose
of a psychedelic substance.
That includes the classic psychedelics,
LSD, psilocybin, mushrooms,
mescaline, peyote.
You can expect zero psychedelic effects.
The rocks don't glitter even a little,
the flowers have no great interest
in you personally.
In fact, if you have anything like that,
that's too high a dose.
[Lily] In college,
I got Adderall from other kids.
I didn't fill my own prescription.
After college,
I felt this mounting pressure from work
to start using my prescription again,
and it was 90 milligrams a day.
The mentality around here is
it should have been done yesterday,
and move fast, break things.
I hate that phrase,
but that's something everybody uses.
You shouldn't be 28 and 29
and talking about
significant burnout and breakdowns.
Are there better, safer, simpler,
less physiologically
disruptive substances,
and that have better side effects?
The substance has never any side effects.
They're all effects.
It's just which ones you wanna...
If you're selling,
you go for one set of effects.
If you're looking at helping people
who are being tortured
by their pharmaceutical,
you look at other effects.
[Lily] When you take Adderall,
there's a sense of urgency
to get through things
as quickly as possible,
but this is, you're comfortable
with taking your time,
and you realize that you can
take your time to execute properly.
The clue came to me some years ago,
where I learned that Albert Hofmann,
who was the man who first synthesized LSD
said that this very low dose area
was incredibly under-researched.
And he said, had Sandoz, his company,
been more active,
there would have not been
a market for Ritalin.
[Lily] But instead, we have this
really highly addictive substance
that is a moneymaker for companies
and doctors.
LSD and mushrooms aren't that.
[Eben whistles]
When I count to four, you do it.
One, two, three, four.
[woman on TV] Starts now on Disney Junior.
I got it.
What? What was that face for?
I haven't had any urge to take Adderall
since my career ended, really.
My mindset is totally different.
I used to need that energy
and that mental chaos. [chuckles]
[woman on speaker] It's easy to forget
that on the most basic level,
we are alive and breathing.
We may have problems...
[Eben] Now, meditation has
helped tremendously
with my focus, my mental clarity.
So, of course, I have days where I'm like,
"Fuck, man. I was in the NFL."
As a rookie coming into the League,
people are telling you,
"You're not gonna be
a football player forever.
The NFL, it stands for 'Not For Long.'"
But you're a 21-year-old kid
who's just realized his dream.
All that shit's
going right over your fucking head.
I really took it as far as I could.
I gave everything I had
until the day came
when I just couldn't do it anymore.
[Brit] The moment
Eben was ready to retire,
I said, "What are you going to write?
Start writing."
[exhales heavily]
[Eben] Sometime in high school,
I fell in love with the idea
of becoming a writer.
I started reading Bret Easton Ellis,
Less Than Zero.
I just felt in my gut,
I was like, "Creative writing's for me."
So, as my career came to an end,
my wife really encouraged me
to take these stacks of journals I had
of writing from my experience
in the league.
"Riding lightning, that's the best way
I can describe taking Adderall.
I took two that Monday night
before kickoff."
It's really exciting to be able to
be on the verge of figuring out
who am I gonna be in this life
after football.
[cell phone ringing]
-Hey, my baby.
-[Rahiem] Yes, Mother.
Don't text me, "I'm at the game, Ma."
You answer the phone when I call you.
I show him this picture all the time.
I'm like, "See, this is what happens
when you don't take your medication."
He kept getting into physical altercations
with another student at the school,
and Rahiem's nose got broken.
I actually had to press charges
against the other kid.
And I felt like
I could no longer handle him,
so I allowed him
to go live with his father in New Jersey.
That's his oldest brother. He's 18.
There was plenty of incidents.
And the day he turned 15, he stole my car.
[interviewer] To do what?
He just stole my car.
I went to go look for my car,
and it was gone.
Parents are crying.
By the time they get to the doctor,
they're crying, they're hurting.
They don't know what to do
with these little people
when they act like that.
[Sherry] There's so much negativity
going around,
saying that if a kid does this too much,
if a kid does that too much,
a doctor automatically wants to say
that they're ADD or ADHD
to just give them medication.
Me being a parent
that actually has a child with it,
and I can tell the difference
between Rahiem and my oldest son.
And as a parent, sometimes
it's disheartening because...
you feel like you're not doing everything
that you can do for your kids.
I still try and encourage him from here.
I ask him every day I talk to him,
"Did you take you take your meds?"
And he goes, "Yes, Mom, I took my meds."
But... I'm hoping this is a good move.
'Cause I'm missing him like crazy.
[chuckles]
[Regina] I don't think he'd have gotten
through high school without Adderall.
He would have gotten through,
but I can't say
that he would be where he is,
to be honest, if he wasn't on it.
As much as I think he's very angry at me
for putting him on the Adderall,
I think that he appreciates
me being the heavy,
because if I wasn't, you know...
where would we all be?
[Nathanael] I was very fortunate.
I started this process on New Year's,
2016, and said,
"Erin," my girlfriend,
"I think I'm going to do a boot camp."
And then I did all of the things
that I had to do
to make that happen.
One of those things
was getting on Adderall.
I pretty much got everything I wanted.
The pay's great,
and a recruiter from Google approached me.
And that's crazy. For me, that's crazy.
There's no way any of that
would have been possible
without the medication.
That might be because
I have really severe ADHD,
and have a hard time
performing in the ways needed.
It might be because it was jet fuel
and it got me where I needed to go.
I don't try to draw a line between those.
[interviewer] Have you tried
any of the stimulants yourself?
One time, in that first Ritalin study.
It was sort of late afternoon.
I felt like it was
such an enhancement of my day.
So, yes, you know,
it was a good experience,
and thank goodness I did not decide
to dip into that barrel ever again.
[interviewer] Did you get your grades
back already?
I got one grade back from the exam
I took this morning at 10:00.
And I got an A.
The stress really
doesn't ever leave entirely.
But I'm excited, once I graduate,
to be able to leave that at work.
I have a pretty good feeling
that this will be the end
of my relationship with Adderall.
Hopefully, in the adult world,
I'll manage my time well enough
that there won't be a time where
I need to take prescription drugs,
to get my work done.
Hopefully, it's the end.
I don't know where I will be,
but when I picture it,
I don't picture myself taking Adderall.
[Blue] The purpose of Adderall for me
is to focus on work.
If I can get to a place
where work is running itself
and things are okay, then I don't need it.
If I hit
for $200 million dollars tomorrow,
I'd never take Adderall again.
But then I need my Adderall
to remember to play,
'cause I keep forgetting
to play the lottery. [chuckles]
[Ariana] I'm just so much more boring
when I'm on my medication.
Also angrier.
But yesterday, I had to study all day,
so I was on Vyvanse,
and I took an Adderall,
and I was wired the whole time.
[chuckles] Felt like shit,
but I got my work done.
So, it's just this balance
you have to figure out.
[Delaney] I'm just getting
a little disillusioned
with this higher education thing.
You need a bachelor's degree
to be anybody.
And we're all high on ADD meds
as a group of 20-something-year-olds
just fighting each other for...
For what? To set the curve in a class?
[Schwarz] What you have here is a dynamic
of not only people using what is
a dangerous drug,
particularly when used improperly.
But you also find
a bit of an arms race building up
where if enough people see
that their competition is doing it,
they feel like they kind of
have to do it, too.
[Chatterjee] I think focusing on the use,
or abuse,
depending on how people feel about this,
is symptomatic of something broader.
This highly competitive environment
in which people feel compelled
to compete beyond their possibilities
to get ahead.
This kind of focus
on material progress and productivity...
What's the cost of that?
And is that a cost
we're willing to live with?
[Sherry] I wouldn't say
that I'm happy to have Adderall,
but I'm happy that
Adderall is an option for him.
[Jasper] After not being on it
all the time,
I feel more comfortable with who I am,
with my body and stuff.
I would never put my kid
on Adderall, ever,
'cause I know what it does to you,
and it's not fun being on it.
I feel like it was too easy to put
a kid on something close to meth
and not question it.
There's other things you can do.
Just teach him how to focus.
It was about being the best.
The NFL is a symbol of that level, really.
[interviewer] Do you wish that
you had not taken that Ritalin?
[inhales deeply]
No. I mean, I was doing what I had to do,
and I'm happy to be on this
next chapter of my life.
It's never so bad that
you can't climb out of the hole.
[Brown] Adderall, the drug of our time.
I suppose the question of what's lost
if we all were in an Adderall world,
is the question, "What is it all for?"
I just lost my thought.
Hang on one second.
I had it. I had an example.
What we also might say is lost
is what human beings do
when they muse and when they reflect
and when their thoughts wander.
I know what I'll do. Okay.
And out of that comes, what?
Creativity, art,
extraordinary moments of human connection.
Of course, also moments
of intense human pain and grief,
but I would describe them
as the experience of being human itself.
[synth music playing]
