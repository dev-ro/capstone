While on his way back from Srisailam..
What's the Home minister upto?

ln another hour.. l want to

-Arjun.. don't know what's going on..
-He'll be fine..
Something is wrong..
They're saying he's critical..
but, not giving any details..
Apart from CM's critical condition..
The other issue which is being strongly
debated in the political circles is..
Who will be the next CM?
let's ask our bureau chief's
opinion on this..
Home Minister and Deputy CM are together..
They are planning a meeting..
You talk to Peddaina..
ask him to declare you as
the lnterim CHlEF MlNlSTER..
Dhanu is hardly 30 years..
How can he be a CM?
And for how long that
family will be ruling the state?
You should talk to him..
ln the current situation..
Only Dhanunjay seems to have
the best chance of becoming a CM..
He's a usless fellow..
How can Dhanu be a CM?
Who will support him?
-We'll support him..
-What?
Provided you guys are made ministers..
Having an usless CM is good for us..
we can get more cabinet berths..
and we can get our work done..
-Hello Peddaina..
-Tell me
Home Minister and Deputy CM
are scheming something..
That's common in politics..
They'll definitely try to
exploit the situation..
You're as well doing the same..
You'll have to take care of them..
Yes.. l am on my way..
Come fast.. See you..
The worsening health
condition of the CM,..
..has pushed the state
into political uncertainty..
And political analysts believe that,
the arrival of ''PEOPLES' PARTY''..
..President MAHADEVAYYA,
will put an end to it..
lt is believed that, he'll either persuade
or intimidate Munuswamy,..
..Home Minister and
Deputy CM to keep them in check..
Sir.. What about our portfolios?
l'll take care of them.. okay
Now go and handle the media..
Say that investigation is on and
we'll get hold of the people involved..
Come on move..
-What's with you?
-Me as interm CM?
Where is Arjun?
Don't worry..
These things are common in politics..
Rajamma..
Sit down..
Be strong and take care of yourself..
You don't seem to have eaten anything..
Get something for her to eat
-Sncle..
-Get some breakfast..
Be strong and take care of mom..
Doctor.. What's his condition?
He is still in coma sir.
We've stopped the bleeding..
But, we're still removing
the metal pieces..
Snless he gets out of coma,
We can't say anything sir..
Haven't you heard it?
-Press conference is going on..
-Ok..!
-Go and give this information to them..
-Okay..
Sit down
-Before Peddaina leaves.. Tell him,
we have an all party meeting.. -Ok..
Are you blind?
Rajamma..
You don't worry..
lt's the PM's call..
Greetings sir!
Mom.. do you want to eat anything?
Mr.Sanjeevaiah is a great leader..
He's loved and adored
by all the people of our state..
How can anyone think of assassinating him?
lt's not important, whether it's
terrorists or naxals behind this..
What's important is..
Why have they done this?
He's a great leader, who's been
working for us and for the country..
-Sir..
-Why did they attack him?
ls this the time to ask about
the next government?
Please may l have a word
with you for a minute?
He's our great leader..
Sir.. please save me..
l need your help..
Hey, get up!
What's the matter?

That property is stuck in a court case..
To get it cleared from the case..

-Please do something about it sir..
Please -lt's okay..

Dhanu to look into it, okay?
No sir.. no..
He'll not do it.. and nobody will do it..

Dhanu.. A guy out there is saying
he had given some money to dad..

Who?
Don't know.. He was talking
about some property dispute..
He seems to be troubled..
How much did he say?
10 crores..
He must be bluffing..
You don't bother..

Why are you worried?
You don't worry about him..
These things are common for us..
l'll take care of him.. Okay
Someone says he has paid money.
You take care of the guy..
Okay..
See you Arjun..

Dad..
Dad..
Our Great leader and Chief Minister
of the state Mr.Sanjeevayya..
At around 1 :30 this afternoon..
Our Great leader and Chief Minister
of the state Mr.Sanjeevayya..
Passed away..
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
What's it Srikanth?
CM has left some cash with me..
-Should l inform Arjun?
-How much?
Around.. 500 crores..
Give 200 crore rupees to Arjun..
Keep the rest with you..
Sncle..
ls everything done?
just wanted to let you know..
Thought it might be helpful
for your future plans..
Dad has left about 50 crores in cash..
..and more than 100 acres
of his property with me..
Sncle, you don't need to tell
these things to me now..
lt's my responsibility
to let you know..
You'll anyway leave to S.S..
l am saying so that, you can convert
everything into cash and take it..
lt's okay..
Calm down..
l can understand your state of mind now..
But, lt's his property and
you are his rightful heir..
Moreover, it is my responsibility
to give it to you..
Hope you understand..
Okay..
l'll leave now..
This is dad's personal diary..
lt's 1500 crores, he's given to uncle..
None of them who gave
you money are honest..
They gave you money because,
they are scared of Dhanu..
20,000 crores?
Mom, dad has 20,000 crores?
Was he so corrupt?
lt's not dad alone..
The whole system is corrupt..
He was just a small pawn in the system..
He conspired and played his game..
But, he couldn't change
the rules of the game..
Within 2 years of coming into power..
He lost his honesty and
became part of this system..
He literally created criminals..
To counter Dhanu.. He brought in
Deputy CM and to counter him..
He brought in Home Minister..
And when they started looting..
he couldn't do anything..
lnstead, he himself started looting..
Does Peddaina know this?
He knows but, he's not bothered..
Because, he's egoistic and casteist..
He wants only his family
members to rule the state..
But, he's not bothered
about their governence..
Even if he knows that Dhanu
might have got his brother killed..
He'll not do anything..
And He'll not allow anybody else
to become a CM..
Except you..
Only you have that chance..
As his son, you've that chance..
That's why l am saying..
l'll talk to Peddaina..
l want you to become the CM..
Change the rules of this game..
Dad couldn't do it..
You do it..
Look..!
He wanted to destroy corruption..
..and the caste system..
He had lot of plans..
But, he couldn't do anything..
People are dying..
They've lost hope in politicians..
Give them a small hope, Arjun..
lt was the most shameful day of my life..
lt was a petty village dispute
lt was blown out of proportion..
And soon escalated into a war
between Peddaina and the dalits..
He was so infuriated that,
He set the whole village on fire..
Peddaina.. let's compromise
You want me to compromise with them..
You are a CM..
Are you not ashamed to say that?
just take everybody
and get out from here..
l don't want anyone here..
Peddaina..
This is not good for the government..
People will not forgive us..
You keep quiet thinking that
They are so agitated
They'll attack our families tomorrow..
just resign if you can't manage..
l'll make Dhanu a CM..
At that moment..
lf l had asked the chief of police
to take strong action..
May be, l would've put an end to this
lawlessness in the name of caste, forever..
But l didn't dare do it..
Fearing the wrath of Peddaina..
For a loan of 1000 crores..
We had to kneel before the world bank..
lnstead, if we had tried
unearthing the black money..
We would have retrived 1 lakh crores,
within one year in our state alone..
But, we didn't do it..
Because we were spineless..
Politics is all about money..
lt's all about buying and
selling people for power..
Dhanu, Deputy CM and
my brother-in-law are grouping..
Dhanu at the age of 30 aspires
to be the next CM..
And Peddaina is okay with it..
How can Dhanu be a CM?
He's 30, with 3 rape cases..
No qualification..
Alcohol and drug abuse..
Doesn't know the meaning of democracy..
How can he be a CM?
My son Arjun would be a better choice..
None has played a game like this
Life is like a chess play
These flames can't be extinguished
The Ceremony ends in this fire
A betrayal of the good in the war
This crime won't continue
This is our generation..
Salutations to Mother lndia!
To my nation which
remains alone..
Let it be as a Dhuruva star
in the broken sky..
Money rules the
power and pride..
..Would change it for the good
And troubles into a bed of roses
He promised to pay for this bread..
Salutations to Mother lndia!
Come, let us destroy the corruption
Your kind person CM Mr.Sanjeevaiah
What is it Rajanna?
Dad gave a black bag to me..
-When was this?
-Three days ago..
Three days ago?
-Let's go home fast.. urgent..
-Okay sir..
Arjun Sir..
-Yes Rajanna? -For my daughter's
medical college admission..
l took 20 lakhs from the bag..
Sorry sir..
l will slowly return the money..
Don't be sorry Rajanna..
You've proved that,
honesty is still left in a few people..
lt's okay..
Take good care of her education..
-Thank you sir..
-Now let's go fast
Dear.. phone..
Ali..
lt's me Arjun, CM'S son..
l found your money..
All your problems are solved..
Sir.. is that true?
Come and meet me in the morning.. okay..
Yes sir..
l'll be there..
Mr. Mahadevayya..
ln this state..
Right from a peon's post, to a CM's post..
All the appointments happen
with your approval..
But, you don't allow anybody
else to be in power..
Except your family members..
lf that's the situation.. When will the
weaker sections of the society prosper..
Why are you being so casteist?
Look Raniamma..
Based on their occupations..
People were divided into
different castes centuries ago..
This is not something,
that we've created now..
Therefore a ruler should always rule
and a cleaner should always clean..
Only then, we'll have some discipline
in our growth as humans..
and that's my belief
Do you mean to say that..
Other than Dhanunjay..
Nobody else will get a chance to be a CM..
Yes..
lt's birthright of my family..
l am of the same opinion..
Apart from news,
we also have opinions..
Find where is Munuswamy?
-What?
-Nothing uncle.
l'm leaving to S.S in 10 days..
l'll need cash..
Sell all the properties..
Any business plans?
Yes, planning..
l need cash urgently..
-l'll arrange for it in 2 or 3 days..
-Give the phone here..
Arjun, Dhanu here..
Why are you in such a hurry?
Stay back till l become a CM..
No Dhanu..
Once the business is set there..
l can relax..
When is your election?
l don't need the election..
lt's a mere formality..
lt'll happen in the next two weeks..
Hello is it Mr. Srikanth?
Mr. Arjun Prasad..
Sir, transfer the amount,
we've spoken about..
-lt's urgently..
-You want only cash sir?
-Yes..
-What is it Arjun?
lnstead of property..l'll take cash..
Okay Sir..
lt's urgent..
Hello is it Mr. Penchallayya?
Everything in Cash..
in one week..
Mom.. l am not going to S.S
-Sure?
-l'm sure..
Any grudge against anybody?
Mom! Nothing like that..
l just want to do what dad couldn't do..
At least then, will the
people forgive him?
They'll forgive him..
They'll definitely forgive him
for being your father..
Thank you Sir..
you saved my life.. thank you sir
lt's okay..
lt's your money right?
People are killing each other
for petty amounts..
just because l asked you..
You've trusted me and got my money back..
Sir, l owe you my life..
You've given me a new life
To save my own property..
l bribed every crook in the government..
lncluding your dad..
There is no humanity
left in our society sir..
lt's filled with parasites
The whole system is corrupt sir..
Shall we change it?
Or at least shall we try to change it?
You must be knowing
everyone in our government?
You must be knowing
how much to pay? Who to pay?
To get your work done
with the government..
You need to bribe them
Even a kid knows this..
l certainly know the price
of everyone in the system..
Will you work for me?
l'll do anything for you..
Sir.. l owe you my life..
What's my job sir?
Ali, l am going to be the next CM..
You are my first employee..
You are my secretary..
Nobody should know this
-Want to drink some water?
-No..
This is such a big news..
l've just come here for an interview..
My boss will go cray..
l'll definitely get a promotion..
Look.. What's your name?
Look Ratna..
This news is not for people..
Nobody should know this..
You need to be silent about this..
You want me to remain silent?
lt's impossible..
lt's so unlike me..
Look Ratna..
Tell how much you want?
You want to bribe Ratna?
l am a media person not a politician..
Okay okay.. take it as a gift
Look!

..to remain silent about this whole thing
He will come as a
prince in fiction story
And will take you in flying horse..
Tell me what you want?

Look
Look Ratna..
The country is in grave danger..
There's no awakening in the society..
lt's mass hysteria all around
Youngsters are sleeping
Politicians are looting..
There is no safety,
Especially for girls like you..
So what?
What do you mean? So what?
As a responsible citien is it not
your responsibility to help me?
What is in it for me?
What is in it for me Arjun?
What has this country given me?
lf l die today,
l won't even get a PF..
Why should l sacrifice myself
for a country like this..
l'm capable of giving
a good speech as well.. okay..
Okay..
What do you know about me?
l might be a drunkard,
l might be a womaniser..
Even if the CM's son was a pig,

None of the girls in the
country would mind it..
But, l am not okay with it
But Arjun. You don't have a choice
and that's the reason..

-Otherwise..
-Otherwise?
Pay me 50 crores..
-l'll settle for 10?
-Okay
Look Ratna..
we'll pay 5 lakhs okay
l am talking with the CM..
Not with you..
Tell me Arjun..
Hey don't be so worried..
All the guys, who l have wooed till now..
Have fallen for me..
Your 50 crores are safe..

-But the deal was only one..
-Look Dhanujay..

Give your blessings to him..
Get up and take his blessings..
You guys stay here..

Peoples' party president
Mr.Mahadevayya,..

state in the party meeting..
What did the girl say?

They'll kill us..
One small mistake and we'll be
slaughtered, they're criminals..

And you want to tag along

Moreover, you don't even help me
Why should l help you?
Are you a saint?
What is so great about what you doing?
You are conspiring to become a CM..
You're not satisfied with
what your dad looted..
you want power..
So that you can loot more..
That's it right?
You'll only remember that he was corrupt..
But, you don't remember that
he's dead and was murdered..
History will never forgive him..
People will also never forgive him..
l am just trying to change that.
Not to loot more money..

Get in..
Ali, of all the people
who came to party..
42 MLAs belong
to Peddaina's group..
Apart from them 30 MLAs
belong to dhanu's group..
We can't do anything about them..
This is the list of remaining 53 MLAs..
Of this 14 MLAs belong to
Deputy CM and Home Ministers group..
Now our job is to get
these 53 into our group..
l know everybody's character..
Everyone can be bought Leave it me..
l'll manage them..
But, there is a problem Ali..
lf Dhanu get's to know this..
lt'll be a big mess..
We'll not involve you..
lnstead, l'll give the money..
How'll you manage
without me being involved?
Sir..They are politicians..
They'll just take the money..
They'll not be bothered to know..
who's paying them..
They'll not ask who's paying
but, they'll definitely ask why?
Correct..
lf they get to know that it's for their vote..
All of them will discuss..
Then, everybody will get to know..
You do one thing..
Get me all the information about
these 53 MLAs.. By evening..

Okay.. see to it..
Okay.. then smile.. Smile..
-Did he smile?
-Yes..
Are you sure?
-Let's go..
-Did you see?
Sorry for calling you urgently..
Nothing much sir..
Before dad's 11th day ceremony..
l wanted to do a few things
that dad wanted to do..
Sir dad had written about
you in his personal diary..
lt seems, you've always stood by him,
without expecting anything in return..
lt seems he always felt bad
that he couldn't do anything for you..
..Mom told the same..
-Sir, take this
-What's this?
Money.. it's 2 crores..
-For who?
-lt's for you
-Why?
-Take it for dad..
This is the burial ground..
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
..filled with selfishness
This is our nation
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
Sir, actually dad wanted
to give you 4 crores..
But, l couldn't manage the rest..
ln another 10 days, l'll send the rest..
You be happy..
This is our nation
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
Sir.. just a sec..
Don't let anyone know
that l gave you money..
Not even to your family members..
We'll have tax problems..
No.. nobody will know it..
God bless you son..
God bless you..
Yes.. You are so different
from Dhanunjay..
He's born to a great man..
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
lf we ask.. will he vote for us?
He'll die for you..
Will he tell anyone?
He'll die.. but, he'll not tell
Will the plan work?
100% Mr.CM
Should l get another MLA?
l am hungry..
First we'll have something.. Rajanna..
Let's go..
This is the cemetery of selfishness..
lt runs as a chariot in the world
This is our nation
No one has played a game like this
Life is like a chess play
These flames can't be extinguished
The Ceremony ends in this fire
This is betrayal of the good in the war
This crime won't continue
This is our generation..
This is our nation
Deputy CM and Home Minister..
My dad gave you those portfolios..
That's why, l called you like that..
lf you want.. l can repeat few more times..
Because, if Dhanu becomes a CM..
you'll lose those portfolios..
They look at each other..
Forget about portfolios..
Dhanu doesn't spare anyone
who come in his way..
You guys may end up in jail..
And lt's a fact..
l respect you a lot..
More than that, l love my dad..
You'll have to do me a favour
along with your 14 MLAs
Take it.. lt's okay.. Take it..
Go in and check the flat..
This world bestows to money
Let the fate good or bad,
don't give up
Let the fate good or bad,
don't give up
Sit down sir..
Your portfolios and this flat all yours..
Tell me..
This is our nation
This is our nation
What is it?
At this hour of the day..
ln this rain.. you are here
-Come in.. come in..
-Sit down..
-ls Arjun seeing any white girl?
-No
Then, what's the problem?
Peddaina.. you'll have to give me your word..
Definitely.. Ask me
You shouldn't go back on your word..
You are wife of my brother
who was like my son to me..
lt's not even 10 days since his death..
You're here with your son,
At this hour of the day
asking me for a promise..
How can l not give it?
l'll definitely stand by it..
What is it?
Ask me
My husband's last wish..
My son Arjun should be the CM..
with your support..
You've promised..
What's with you?
You said you are leaving to S.S
and settle in your business..
What's this suddenly?
Don't be a fool..
What do know about politics?
Dhanu is cray..
He might even kill you..
What should l tell him now?
Tell me
Everyone seems to be taking
their own decisions..
it's party meeting in the morning..
Dhanu will be unanimously
declared as the next CM..
Everything is planned that way..
After making him a CM
l've decided to head back home
Listen.. in this situation..
it's really tough..
it's out of my hand..
lf it was possible,
would you have done it?
lf it was possible..
why would l not do it?
Moreover, l promised you..
Listen to me..
lt's very difficult..
it's out of my control..
Ask your group of MLAs not to vote..
and you stay neutral..
lt'll be a unanimous decision..
The question of voting doesn't arise..
-What if it's raised?
-So what?
What did you do?
l got it.. got it
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Peddaina the people of this state
deserve a better CM than Dhanu..
-So.. is this the way to do it?
-This is the only way to do it..
And it should happen now..
This is my only chance..
You've given your word so stand by it..
With Dhanunjay almost certain
to takeover as the next CM..
His supporters've gathered at the party office,
shouting slogans in his support..
Party president Mahadevayya,
will officially declare.
Dhanunjay as the next CM
in a few minutes from now..
The next thing on our agenda is..
Electing the new leader of our party..
l mean the next CM..
lt's a unanimous decision..
Dhanunjay is our party candidate..
How can you elect unanimously sir?
Are you drunk?
We're not so cultured to get drunk and
come to a meeting Mr.Dhanunjay..
Watch what you are saying Mr.Dhanunjay?
What the hell are you guys talking?
-There is no other candidate..
-Are we so thick skinned?
-ls this the way to pay respect
to our beloved leader.. -No sir..
Till now Sanjeevaiah is our CM..
..and after his death,
his son Arjun Prasad is our CM..
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..
Make a note
of everyone whose shouting..
Everybody stop it..
Everybody be seated..
Everybody be seated..be seated..
-Stop it
-Sit down..
You're in a meeting..
Not in a fish market..
We don't want a fight..
We want an election..
Arjun Prasad should be the next CM..
Long live CM Arjun Prasad
Yes, we want an election..
Arjun sir should contest..
Sanjeevaiah is like God to us..
He's your brother..
and Dhanunjay is his nephew..
At the age of 18,
when Dhanu was convicted in a murder..
He got him out
and made him a minister..
Don't you remember that?
He's a God to us, sir..
we won't allow this to happen..
lf an election doesn't happen..
All of us will resign..
Then, our rival Munuswamy
will become the CM..
Don't beat around the bush..
Tell me how much you want and take it?
Don't talk about money..
-lt sounds like a joke..
-Shut up..
What the hell are you talking?
Sit down..
Our portfolios are safe..
Why are you creating this chaos?
Why are you shouting?
Have you gone mad?
Arjun Prasad should be the CM..
How can he be a CM.. He's a kid
Call him here..
lf you want..
l'll call him here.. talk to him
Call him here..
We're calling him wait..
We're calling him..
ln a few days, he's leaving to S.S..
He's not interested in politics..
Moreover we are together..
This is our family matter..
Why are you bringing politics into it..
Call him once..
Call him uncle..
He'll only answer them..
l am the next CM
and he'll repeat the same thing..
l've 3000..
-Hello..
-What?
What's happening inside?
Keep my name out of this..
lt's okay.. tell
No consensus..
Flash news.. focus on
Arjun Prasad's background..
lt was widely believed by the people,
media, and political analysts..
..that Dhanunjay will
take over the political..
..legacy of late Mr.Sanjeevaiah and
become the next CM..
But, as the events unfolded
in the party meeting..
To everybody's surprise,
A new name emerged..
it is neither the Deputy CM
nor the Home minister..
But, it's Late Sanjeevaiah's
son Arjun Prasad..
who doesn't have
any political experience..
Long live..Arjun Prasad
Long live..Arjun Prasad
My brother..
You asked for him..
Arjun tell them..
Tell them that it's me
who's going to be the next CM..
Go
Long live.. Arjun Prasad
Dhanunjay Down with
More than me, my mom and my Family..
lt was always party that came first
to my dad, he loved his party..
He's carried it through
many turbulent times and..
..delivered victories
in the last 13 years..
He's supported everyone of you over here..
He's literally built
your political careers..
ls this the way you
show your respect to him?
lt's not even 10 days since his death..
and you've started
fighting for positions..
ls this the way to show
your gratitude towards him?
ls it not your responsibility to fulfill
his dreams and carry his legacy forward?
Yes.. yes.. yes..
May Sanjeevaiah's soul rest in peace..
Rest in peace
The two people,
who l love the most in this world,
..are my Mom and my Dad..
Both of them have only one wish..
My mom's first wish, since my birth..
My dad's last wish, before his death..
That, l Should become a Chief minister..
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad
Mr.Sanjeevaiah sacrificed
his life for you people..
He was your Leader and
he was brutally assassinated..
You people decide, whether you are..
..responsible to fulfill
his last wish or not..
Since l'm responsible..
l'll fight the election..
For my dad and for all you who love him..
l'll join politics..
whether people like it or not..
l'll fight the election..
Long live.. Our CM
Arjun Prasad Long live..
Our CM Arjun Prasad Long live..
Our CM Arjun Prasad
Arjun Prasad in the fray for CM's Post..
Dhanunjay, who was believed to take over
as the next CM, in a state of shock..
ln the last minute
Late Mr.Sanjeevaiah's son..
Arjun Prasad.. Arjun Prasad..
Arjun Prasad..
Till one hour ago no one knew this name..
Now the whole state seems
to be reverberating with this name..
We'll get you more details
from our reporter...
Yes Raju.. in my opinion Arjun Prasad
is the right choice for the CM's post..
What do you say Ram?
How can you say that he's the
right choice for the CM's post?
What more you need Ram?
28 years of age..
By the age of 25, he's completed
his Ph.D from Havard Sniversity..
Right now, he's a C.E.O
to a fortune 500 company..
Above all he's Sanjeevaiah sir's son..
And that's the biggest quality..
Dhanu is a graduate from Niam College..
Of course he dropped out of it..
By 21 he was youth
wing president of Peoples' party..
And by 26 he was minister
of information and broadcasting..
Of course, by 18 he had various
criminal cases against him..
He was also involved
in lot of other scams..
Show me a politician
who is not involved in any crime.
Are you saying they're right?
lnstead of this mess..
lt's better we have Governor's rule..
That's my opinion..
lf Governor's rule is your opinion..
ln my opinion, Arjun Prasad
should be the CM..
PEOPLES' PARTY OFFlCE
Since our party's emergence 25 years ago..
For the first time today..
We have elected our leader,
through an election..
Our party's leader and
the new C.M of the state is..
Dr.Arjun Prasad
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad
Arjun..
Why did you do this? Why?
Last wish right?
Mr.Sanjeevaiah's last wish?
Do you even realise what you've done?
What do you want?
Money?
Properties? Power?
Women?
l would've given you everything..
My long cherished dream..
Everything is destroyed..
Why did you do this to me?
What did l do to you?
l don't want anything..
l've done this for the people
who've trusted and voted us..
Hope you understand..
Arjun Prasad..
Why did you do this.. Why?
l would have given you everything..
He's turned it around..
Hello Sir.. lt's me Arjun..
CM candidate Arjun?
-Yes..sir
-Congratulations..
-Called to let you something..
-Tell..
l'll arrange for your portfolios
and 1000 crores..
l want your support..
We'll meet soon..
He's just not any other politician..
he's special
There's something about him..
He might end up changing this country..
Arjun..
-Should l come along..
-lt's okay uncle..
Dhanu needs you
You stay here..
Politics is not as simple as wearing
designer shirts and having pias..
Out of experience l am saying
Be careful..
Sncle, l'm not as experienced as you are..
But, for me Politics is all
about buying and selling people.
l don't have to say it to prove it..
Even a kid knows that..
You take care
Salutations to Mother lndia!
Salutations to Mother lndia!
These are the truths,
Fighting for posts..
This is the Change that people want
Raids would make way
for money for peoples' growth
System of society would change.
Okay.. okay
Get a chair..
-Sit down..
-lt's okay..
You've become CM..
What do you know?
And What will you do?
l'll fight corruption
and destroy the caste system..
Fight against corruption
and elimination of caste system?
Look, you are the CM of this state..
Fight against corruption is not a joke..
For last 60 years.. politicians like
you, have made a joke of it..
Now it's time for some action.. Peddaina
Anyway, Don't make a fool of yourself..
And destroy the family esteem..
Our Family esteem?
Since you've asked..
l made you a CM..
Don't let it go to your head..
Protect Dhanu
He's your cousin..
Okay Peddaina..
l don't have anything against him..
Ask him to stay away from me as well..
Mr. Arjun Prasad is to be sworn
in as the new C.M of the state,
..in a swearing in ceremony
to be held in Raj Bhavan..
lt'll be a simple ceremony
minus all the revelry..
To avoid squandering of public money..
This decision was taken
Dhanu Calm down.. calm down..
You'll not be able to
eliminate him like this..
-Cool down and listen to me once..
-What is it?
join Arjun's cabinet as an Home Minister..
lt will be easy for you to eliminate him..
Talk to Peddaina
he'll make it happen..
Peddaina
At this hour of the day?
ln this rain?
What brings you here with Dhanu?
Aunty you are like my mother to me..
Only you can do this for me..
Nothing much Aunty..
l should join Arjun's Cabinet
as an Home Minister..
lt's already.. Peddaina
given to Mr.Venkat Naidu..
Peddaina spoke to Mr.Venkat Naidu..
He's ready to take coals and mines..
Please see that, l get
Home ministry aunty..
Peddaina, say something?
Peddaina
Aunty you've promised me.. That's all
l lost my husband..
l didn't say anything..
Now, l can't risk my son's life..
lf Dhanu becomes the Home Minister..
lt'll be very risky for Arjun..
Don't do this to us..
He can ask for other portfolio..
l beg you Peddaina..
you don't have to do that..
Peddaina, Dhanu will
be the Home minister..
Dhanu..
l Arjun Prasad..
As the Chief minister of Andhra Pradesh..
l will honestly and sincerely do my duty..
l swear in the name of my soul..
Take your Seat sir..
-He's Mr.Smesh Gupta..
-Chief Security Officer
We are your dad's staff..
All of you will continue
in your same positions..
They are my friends..
Guess they are his personal...
They are not here to collect money..
They are not brokers..
They are my friends..
lf you feel embarrassed talking to me
about anything.. you can talk to them..
Sir.. What's our agenda?
Fight against corruption,
single point agenda..
That's it nothing more..
Mr.Sharma and Smesh, come with me..
Mr.Sharma.. l need 500 highly qualified
honest people..
To work with me for one year..
Salary 5 lakhs per month..
but, they shouldn't seek a penny more
than the salary.. Can you find them?
500 honest people..
lts difficult sir..
lf the salary is 5 lakhs per month..
They'll have to deal in crores..
When they have chance of making crores..
5 lakhs will not stop them sir..
Mr.Sharma are you saying that..
in this entire state..
we won't be able to
find 500 honest people?
Aren't you ashamed of saying that?
Why should anyone be honest sir? Why?
By being honest, who are we helping sir?
To fill the pockets of these
ignorant politicians..
why should anyone of us sacrifice?
We won't find them
Sorry..
-l was frank in my opinion..
-lt's okay..
l'm just asking to work honestly..
not asking for any great sacrifices?
ln today's time.. working honestly
is a sacrifice in itself sir..
One minute sir..
One more thing..
Don't make statements like
fight against corruption etc..
People are laughing..
From last 60 years every politician
has been saying the same thing..
You've become a joke..
The way you dress and the way you talk..
Moreover, your dad was
an epitome of corruption
You talking like that sounds like a joke..
The present Anti Corruption Bureau
will be revamped from a 200 personnel..
..government department,
to a 2000 personnel cabinet ministry,..
with special cabinet powers,
and all the necessary amendments..
..to make these changes will be
tabled in the assembly tomorrow.
The objective of this ministry is..
to unearth 1 lakh crores of
black money in the next one year..
People can see the amount of money
coming into PEOPLE'S FSND.. everyday..
ln television channels and news papers..
We start some commotion in the chairs..
ln the next phase
We'll account and spend
each and every penny..
All the information about
the money spent will be seen in the TV
That's all
You might think that,
l have enough..
Now, l'm going after others money..
First contribution to our PEOPLE'S fund..
ls what my dad looted, when
he was in power.. 20,000 crores..
l'll immediately transfer the
money into PEOPLE'S FSND..
So, remaining target is 80,000 crores..
Without wasting much time..
Let's get down with the task..
The Government has
resolved to fight corruption..
..and unearth the black money
in the state..
As a first step.. it has
decided to strengthen ACB..
..by revamping it into
a 2000 personnel cabinet ministry..
with independent cabinet powers.
All the corruption cases
will be moved to..
..special fast track courts to
avoid delay in the cases.
Sir.. By tomorrow l'll get you
the 500 honest people.. you asked for..
You said we won't find them?
Sir.. l thought we'll never find
a politician like you as well..
But, we found you..
ln my 30 years of service..
l have only seen politicians,
who are corrupt..
And they've made so much of money that
their next 10 generations don't need to work..
l've never seen a CM,
who's given up a penny at least..
History will remember you sir..
Sir.. Your security is very important..
We have lntelligence reports..
So.. l'll have black commandos
to give me company.. Okay..
Sir there is a serious threat
from your own people..
We also have proofs..
-But, we'll have serious
political implications.. -Who?
Dhanunjay is involved sir..
No..no.. we can't interrogate Dhanu..
lf we interrogate him
there will be no government..
lt's a serious threat sir..
please take it seriously..
First protect me..
We can think of Dhanu later..
Protect me till l get that money
and also till l spend it for the people
Arjun.. l am impressed..
Really.. l am very impressed..
Even if mom scolds it's okay..
And even though you've not
given any commitment..
You can kiss me..
Pleasure is all yours
Pleasure is all yours
Again.. he's impressed me..
Given a chance he doesn't
take advantage of it..
Assassination bid on CM Arjun Prasad
by unidentified gunmen...
The entire State is shocked at incident..
But, the CM is safe and
there is no risk to his life..
Mom.. Come in..
Nothing happened.. Sit down..
-What happened?
-Calm down, mom.
lt's okay mom... calm down...
Nothing happened
You would have been happy in SS...
lt's all Because of me
Mom... What happened now?
All of them are here to protect me...
Also, l was wearing a bullet proof jacket...
You go back..
Honesty is dead in this country...
lts demons all around here...
You are not cursed to live with them...
lt's not a curse mom...
lt's my destiny...
There is something about being a CM...
lt has redeemed me of Anger, resent,..
..selfishness and everything
lt redeemed of fear of death as well...
Don't say that...
People will spit on your face...
lf people get to know this..
They'll hurl shoes at you...
Conspire against him, play politics..
But, this is not the way..
You didn't do anything when he
grabbed power from me...
lnstead you supported him..
Why are you bothered about him peddaina?
l am furious from within..
No! l'll not spare him..
Shut up..
You're getting on to my nerves...
l am warning you...
Moreover, l am not bothered about him...
l am bothered about you..
lf we don't go and meet him now...
You'll end up in jail...
Don't take him for granted...
He'll not keep quiet...
He almost destroyed you
when he was powerless...
And now he's a CM..
Come..
Sister
-How are you?
-l am fine..
Rajamma..
Peddaina..
lt's his first mistake...
l'll forgive him...
l want his resignation
on my table by tomorrow...
Otherwise, he'll end up in jail...
Home Minister Dhanunjay
resigned owning
Responsibility over the murder
attempt on CM Arjun Prasad..
This is how our assembly looks...
Created by the people...
for the people... of the people...
Our sacred temple, where the destiny
of our people is decided...
-Greetings, sir!
-Greetings!
-File sir..
-lt's okay.. -This way..
This was your dad's seat...
-See you sir...
-Okay...
Mr.Speaker
Bringing out black money and
prosecuting
Black marketers in Special Courts
immediately.
That is my proposal.
-This is not possible and we don't agree,
Mr.Speaker.. -Please be seated..
Please be seated...
Please be seated...
-CM is speaking, Please be seated.
-Don't accept..
Mr.CM you continue...
lncreasing the preview of ACB...
l'll get all the departments...
All the professionals...
..including public representatives
under ACB's perview...
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Please be seated..
Why do you make a fuss?
Listen to me..
Please be seated...
Mr.Srinivas you talk...
Mr.Speaker, CM is not being clear
about his proposed law...
There are lots of loopholes in this law...
The govt will end up
running around the courts...
lncome Tax is under central Govt.
How can we meddle in that Mr.Speaker?
Mr.Speaker that'll not be a problem...
We'll seek the permission
of the lncome tax
l've already given all the details,
in the documents l've submitted...
Mr.Speaker, every year we take
pride in presenting budgets,
..worth thousands of crores...
But, out of every 100 crores we sanction...
80 crores are looted by crooks...
This is the truth and
everybody knows this truth...
Please be seated..
Please be seated..
lt's the truth and everybody
knows this truth...
We didn't do anything to stop it...
lnstead, we remained silent spectators...
lt's a shame on us...
Snparliamentary language Mr.Speaker...
Okay... We will remove
shame from the records..
Mr.CM you continue...
Corruption and Development
can't go together...
Our grandfathers said that
we are a Developing Nation...
Later, our parents
repeated the same thing...
Today, we're still repeating
the same thing...
And tomorrow, our grand children
will repeat the same thing...
When will we call ourselves
a Developed Nation Mr.Speaker?
We can never call ourself a developed
nation, unless we destroy corruption...
-Sit down...
-Sit down...
-Come along...
-Yes sir..
-How was your first day?
-lt was good Sir...
-Will the bill be passed?
-No chance
Greetings sir!
We're just asking to
punish the criminals..
What's their problem
in supporting that sir?
Criminals caught in serious offences..
..safely walk out of jails in no time...
We seem to be a doomed state?
We are just asking for stringent laws...
We're not asking for any personal favors..
That's why l am saying..
Come sit...
You are mistaken there...
We'll be the biggest losers...
We need corruption...
lf we make stringent laws like this
and satisfy people...
We won't have the
opportunity to be corrupt...
What if people revolt?
Are they fools?
What if they question us?
What do we answer them?
Nobody has time for this
question and answer session?
A guy with his hard earned money
will buy a chicken biryani...
lf we take away chicken from it,
he'll manage with dal...
lf we take away the dal...
he'll manage with soup...
And if we take away the rice, he'll panic...
Then, we'll give him free rice...
He'll get very excited and forget
his work and chicken biryani...
And he'll be our slave forever...
Nobody wants answers
and this is our policy...
-But, isn't it wrong?
-No, it's not...
People aren't expecting anything from us...
As long as they remain the same,
they'll vote us...
We should also keep them the way they are...
They don't have any hope on us and
we don't have any right over them...
Why are you laughing?
Nothing... l am wondering,
when you'll die?
Give me your hand sir...
You must be around 75-85 years...
You must have touched
Gandhi with your hands...
And you must have seen
Nehru with your eyes...
Your intelligence and experience
is of no use to anyone...
Since you are usless...
lt doesn't make any difference,
whether you live or die...
Listen... help me...
l don't like you sir...
-Do you want the bill to get passed?
-Yes sir..
Then, Exempt MLAs and
politicians from the bill...
Who taught you boy?
Will anyone agree to create
a law to prosecute themselves?
Do as l say, and the bill
will be passed... okay...
Mr.CM continue
Mr.Speaker an important amendment...
l am exempting MLAs and
politicians from his law...
Continue Mr.CM
Everyone is aware of our honesty...
We are immune to laws..
Because, they don't apply to us..
Atleast now... Smile
No sir? We've let off the main culprits...
Very good!
You don't know the power
of the law you've created...
When you catch hold of all the small fish...
Sharks will be left with
no food and they'll panic...
Corrupt are always hungry...
and hunger ones are desperate...
l'll be happy to have you
charged as well sir...
Don't be in such a hurry young man...
There is something about you...
But, you'll not stay for
more than 6 months...
The moment MLAs get to know your plan..
You'll be out...
Anyway, today the mood
in the house is positive
l'm a little satisfied...
Well said about Gandhi, it hit me hard...
You were looking forward
for my death right?
Atleast now, do you think
l deserve to live for another 2-3 years?
Sir 200 of them...
We are tapping phones
of their relatives and friends
First raid the Singur gang...
What is it?
You haven't washed the clothes yet?
Don't look at my face like a dumb ass...
Who is it?
My husband is not at home
Do you have accounts for all this?
Tell me madam
No sufferings and no burden
No king and no poor
There are gooddays all..
PEOPLES' FSND tally reaches 22,000 crores...
CM, he is for poor
CM, he changes the future
CM, he is for us
CM, he is a person among us
No sufferings and no burden
No king and no poor
There are gooddays all..
My brother-in-law's house
is being raided by ACB guys...
lf we start raiding our own people then,
what's the need of this Govt?
PEOPLES FSND, 25,200 crores...
CM Arjun Prasad has
announced Rs 500/month..
..to all the kids going to Govt schools...
CM, he is God to the poor
PEOPLES FSND totally
reaches 25,200 crores...
Why is he not meeting us?
Do you know how much
l've spent for the party fund?
For two days, l've been
trying to meet him...
Do you know who am l?
My brother-in-law
is the Education minister..
Tell me how much he wants, l'll pay...
How can they raid me?
They raid people based on
the money they've looted...
No...
Why do you push me?
This CM seems to be sparing no one...
Please leave me...
Hello, come here...
l warned you against this...
l couldn't stop myself from taking it...
Dad, all because of you...
l really feel embarrassed to go to school...
ACB is carrying out wide spread
raids through out the state...
But, there seems to be some opposition to
this, from some sections of the society...
l request all the opposition parties
and the human rights commission,..
..to come forward and stop
this unruly act by the Govt.
l'll never vote for this CM
Film stars, Doctors and Contractors...
Everybody is being raided...
Call for a meeting with the lawyers...
Gentlemen we are fighting corruption
and you are trying to stop us...
That shouldn't happen...
No matter what happens,
ACB raids should go on...
Tell me what you want for that?
-What CM is implying is...
-No matter what happens
Govt. should win morally...
You guys fight the case strongly..
But, should lose the case..
Mr. Home Minister, how do you
support the Government's actions?
l myself feel that ACB is going
a little overboard with the raids...
We plan to take up the issue with the CM...
Do you people even
realie what's happening?
just think about it...
Without your knowledge
and without laying his hands on you,..
He is hitting you where it hurts the most...
He is attacking everyone
who you do business with...
And in no time, he'll come to you..
You'll just keep watching...
Hello Mr.Dhanunjay
Sir.. Please come in..
Take your seat..
You know it right?
l was just briefing them about the same...
By now you must have understood, his plot...
Request you all to
understand the situation...
We'll bring him down..
We don't want this CM...
Yes sir, we'll bring him down...
Long live Dhanunjay...
We'll bring him down...
lt's time to meet Deputy CM
and Home Minister...
Sir... They've started to move...
All the MLAs are in panic...
We have raided people, who are closely
linked to nearly 73 MLAs...
There are another 30 MLAs,
who we don't have information about...
l'll make you CM...
And you a Home Minister...
l'll remain as party president...
l need your support to
bring down Arjun's Govt.
1 lakh crores of PEOPLES' FSND..
Will be in your hands...
What is in it for you?
Arjun's death...
Sir... They are...
Any moment from now,
they'll call for a party meeting...
There motive is not next election sir...
As far as l know,
Dhanu's motive is to bring you down...
And MLAs motive is the 1 lakh crores...
They're just waiting to plunder the money...
What are we thinking about?
just get Dhanu killed in an encounter...
He has ruined so many peoples' lives
Mr.Smesh, execute that fellow...
You often do this right?
We'll get rid off him
What's Deputy CM's stand?
This has been his dream sir...
Dhanu was in his way all this while...
Now, he's joined him...
Did they meet Munuswamy?
Will he support them?
They are going to meet
him in a day or two...
His MLAs are restless...
They are terrified about
being raided by the ACB...
lt's high time you meet Peddaina...
-Peddaina?
-Yes sir..
l feel its better you meet Peddaina...
lts 1 lakh crores at stake...
Will they'll plunder 1 lakh crores?
-Sir, we'll meet peddaina once..
-No need..
Call for a party meeting
How will we manage then?
l apologise on behalf of ACB and myself...
Snknowingly, we might have
commited some mistakes...
Forgive me for that...
We have been ambitiously
pursuing PEOPLES' FSND...
ln a week or two, we'll hit
the target of 1 lakh crores...
We've slowly but surely,
started our fight against corruption...
Today every government employee in all
departments is scared to take a bribe...
That's our biggest victory...
Be a little patient...
ln another 2 years, we'll change
the destiny of this state...
What nonsense are you talking about?
You expect us to fight corruption
and stop being corrupt...
Who the hell are you to preach us?
What do you think, we are in politics for?
Come on jama let's leave...
Otherwise, l'll exempt all your relatives...
Like everyone who's related to
your families will be exempted...
Then every one of
you can happily loot people...
Do we look like crooks to you?
That's what people call you...
They call you crooks,
corrupt, opportunist...
Really, are we not ashamed of ourselves?
Do we really need 20 cars,
when we can do with 2?
Do we really need the 100's of acres,
when we can do with 10?
Can we proudly talk about
the money we have made?
Can we proudly live?
We are living like crooks...
Okay...Okay... Leave it there...
Forget whatever l've just said...
You people make money...
Make as much as you want...
l'll not stop you...
But, leave that 1 lakh crores...
l plead all of you to be patient
for another 1 year...
Didn't l tell you?
Politics is not as simple as wearing
designer jeans and having pias?
Even l told you, politics is
all about buying and selling?
Sntil you have people like this,
who can be bought...
You can't say who'll win the battle...
1 lakh PEOPLES' FSND...
we'll not get another chance like this...
What is it?
What happened?
l am losing it mom...
One more week that's all
Don't be sad...
Anyway, you never desired to be a CM...
Leave it...
lt's not about Chief Ministership mom...
l am not bothered about it...
lt's about the people's money...
Sad, it's ending this way...
lts 1 lakh crores mom...
l thought l'll change the
destiny of this state...
lt's all gone to dogs now...
Even when dad passed away
you were not so sad ...
Today, for the fear of
losing people's money,
l see tears in your eyes...
l am very proud of you...
People will never want to lose you...
l know that...
Arjun... Arjun... lt's me Archana...
Who are you?
This guy is Mohan... He's a cop...
l mean cop from a lower caste...
A girl from his caste was
raped by an MLA's son...
Since they didn't act against him...
He's quit his job and he's

Who are you?
How did you get my number?

that justice will be done...
He'll have something right now...
Why are you calling me
for this, at this hour?
lts 00.30 A.M and what can l do?
Call that social welfare minister...
You people elected him.. He'll come
and give him juice or whatever..
Mr.CM please...
He's in a very bad condition...
Nobody is coming forward with help...
Only you can do something about it...
Moreover he's one of those
honest people, you looking for...
l don't want him and l don't need him...
l can't do anything.. lf people really
want honesty, he'll live..
Otherwise, it's his fate...
Arjun please... how can you say so...
Don't irritate me...
You could have slept inside...
just fell asleep here... mom...
Archana is Munuswamy's daughter.
l want her personal and family
details within 1 hour.
l think she is covering
Saroja's case in Munigodu.
But, why do you ask her details?
ln this situation we need Munuswamy's
support for our government.
lf we want Munuswamy's support,
she only can do that.
Her name is Archana..
She's Munuswamy's daughter...
l mean his illegitimate daughter...
Very independent...
bought up by her Mother...
Since her mom's death 4 years ago,
she's staying with her friend in a flat...
Done her Mass communication
from bishop college Bangalore...
Presently, she's heading
a television channel...
Favourite colour is red, favourite game
cricket and a beautiful smile...
She's a very short tempered girl...
She doesn't share a good
relationship with her dad...
She hasn't spoken to him
for the past 12 years...
But, Munuswamy loves his daughter a lot...
He'll do anything for her...
That's it sir...
What about her love life?
No boyfriends in college days...
Lot of boys tried to hit on her
But, ended up facing her wrath...
She likes honest guys...
But sir, right now a guy is pursuing her...
-l've seen him...
-ls he an honest fellow?
He's honestly pursuing her
You take care of him... For the
next 10 days, he shouldn't meet her...

-Why sir?
You've said she likes cricket right?
Going there to bowl...
Where to?
Where is he going?
He's going on some work...
Did he get a way out?
He's trying too hard..
He couldn't sleep the whole night...
You come with me...
l have some work with you...
Look Ratna, you need to do me a favour...
Why should l help you?
Not me... it'll be helpful to Arjun...
Then, l'll definitely do it...
Okay... The plan is..
A guy is planning to propose to his girl...
You should totally confuse
him and stop him...
l don't split couples...
l mean it'll be helpful to Arjun...
Okay... l'll do it...
We want justice for Saroja...
All the culprits involved
should be punished...
Get the juice...
lts okay, be seated...
-Why..!

Why are you doing this to yourself?
Do you promise sir?
Don't pardon them sir...

-Archana... Archana...
Once you done with your work...
Come and meet me... okay?
You stay back and get her...
-CM is calling you..
-We'll take care of all the work... you go...
When CM himself is calling,
why aren't you going?
l just don't want to and
l don't need to go?
Are you cray?
CM himself is calling you and
moreover he's so handsome...
What is it now?
lt's CM who's calling you...
l was a little tense and
was rude to you yesterday...
But, thank you... You made me
do something good...
Everybody has tensions Mr.CM...
But, only politicians seem
to have the need to lie...
You consider it's your birthright...
Thought you were a nice guy
and l called you...
But, l am hurt...
lt was my mistake to have believed you...
l am leaving now
just sit down Archana...
Will you come out
for a dinner with me?
ln Hyderabad... it's my treat...
Hey hey... just sit down...
just listen to me...
just sit down for a second...
Sit..! Look, l am a very sentimental CM...
lf you don't forgive me,
l won't feel like working...
So, just give me a smile
and agree to the dinner...
l don't want to...
l hate politicians...
Don't treat me like a CM...
just treat me like a normal guy...
l agree l was rude to you...
it was my mistake...
But, didn't l turn up early in
the morning with my whole team?
And you're going on and on saying...
You won't believe me and you hate me...
You are coming... Tomorrow to water
front, at 8:00 P.M... That's all...
She's going to meet that guy...
At 6:00 in the evening.
Sir, should l stop her?
Stop her...
l need to reach Assemble, urgently...
The country seems to have changed a lot...
l feel so sad...
Nobody seems to be
bothered about a girl,..
..who's been asking for
a lift from last one hour...
Where is this country heading?
Actually Mr.Ram, don't think otherwise...
But, good people like you,..
..who have concern and love for others,
are very less in number...
People have become heartless...
Where is this country heading?
Today is a very nice day,
l mean, since l've met you...
You are Rj Ratna Prabha?
l am your big fan...
l come across as a very bubbly girl...
always making people laugh...
But, l am a very sensitive person...
Always concern about our society
and everything concerned with it...
Mr.Ram, l will ask you for something...
You shouldn't say no to it...
You can ask...
Will you... have a... cup of coffee with me?
My treat...

Petrol is leaking..

There's CM's guest house nearby...

Sit down... So?
Sorry Mr.CM...
-You are a CM...
-So What?
l'll take time...
l was scared...
Didn't you get angry?
l used to get angry...
But, after l've become a CM,
l stopped being angry...
We are not supposed to get angry...
What'll you eat?
l was a firebrand in my college..
l must have slapped atleast 10 boys...
Nothing interesting about my life...
l am a CM's son...
Studied in best and the top schools...
What do you thing about me?
Okay Okay... You say...
Nothing interesting about my life...
l've everything yet l don't have anything...
That's my life...

You don't have a personal phone?
What if your girlfriends call you?
You have any girlfriends?
l generally asked...
l just have friends...
a few of them are girls...
Not friends...
ln mean, in S.S did you date anyone?
When l was a student, l used to...
You didn't like anyone?
No... l didn't like...
What about you?
Will you give me
a personal interview?
Do you have a boyfriend or not?
Will you please give an interview?
Do you have a boyfriend or not?

Waste fellow...
l'll kill you... You are finished...
You intend to kill him or what?
-Tell me.. is it serious or a joke?
-What?
-Your romance plan...
-Ratna, l am just faking...
Faking... You shameless...
Being a CM, you are cheating on a girl...
-lt must be his idea...
-l don't know..
l'll kill you...
l am not cheating her...
lt's a small scheme...
You are not as innocent
as you seem to be...
What scheme..?
Whatever it is... l doubt it...
l can't take a risk...
Give me my 50 crores...
l don't need 50... 5 crores are enough...
After being with you..
l've atleast started loving my country...
Transfer the rest into PEOPLES' FSND...
Look Arjun, if you love
that girl, its okay...
lf not, don't get physical with her...
Otherwise, l'll have to rethink
about our relationship.. Okay?
Thank God... l didn't get
physical with you...
My mom always warned that,
you guys are heartless...
Look here...
Come here...
No boss...
First give me a commitment...
Only then l'll trust you Arjun...
l thought its better
you have a personal phone...
Save my number...
lt'll have only your number...
l seek a place in your heart
But not for the position
Snless we have a corruption free Govt.
and a disciplined workforce...
We are not eligible to spend
taxpayer's money Mr.Speaker...
That's my belief...
l like to service to the people
Are you the dear of the nation?
l'll be a company to you
Even if you are Abdul Kalam,
l'll be yours
Hey CM, this state is ok for you.
But the evening is only for us
As Priya, l am here to help you
These statements are
uncalled for right now...
l warned him Ali...
For another 10 days
he asked me to keep quiet...
l've cancelled all his appointments...
ls CM Arjun Prasad on a Holiday?
Yes is the answer from CM's office..
We need to be careful with him...
He must be planning something...
PEOPLES' FSND has made him
very popular among people.
We need to advertise it
as our party's achievement...
Otherwise, it will be
very difficult to bring him down...
By the time he's back from his holiday...
You should become CM...
ls it nothing between us?
Doesn't it look good?
Will get the respect and
honour only when alone
Life will be bored,
if makes any advance move
lf controls the mind,
lt gives happy
Oh my lover!
This is the truth!
Oh desire! We are made for each other
Are you the dear of the nation?
l'll be a company to you
Even if you are Abdul Kalam,
l'll be yours
Hey CM, this state is ok for you.
But the evening is only for us
As Priya, l am here to help you
Hey CM, the state won't run away
But this sweet welcome
won't come tomorrow
Oh my dear!
But, Mr.CM what message
are you giving to people by smoking?
-l quit smoking...
-Sure...
Ya... lt's for you
Do you know that
you have a lot of admirers?
l also have people who hate me Archana...
l just want to spend that 1 lakh crores,
properly for the people... that's all
Will the money really
be spent for the people?
Don't you believe it?
l believe you Arjun
This is a brutal and a gruesome act...
They are innocent people
and what's their fault?
lt's we, who are at fault... Today l and
my party are ashamed of ourselves...
For we have appointed an inefficient
man as a CM... Please forgive us...
You resign... lf you can't manage, resign...
lf you can't rule the state,
sitting at home...
l'll show you how a
government should be run...
l'll rule my people and my state...
lt's an hour since this attack
and you are coming now,..
..like you have come for
a fashion parade here?
Are you not ashamed of yourself?
Look at them... atleast after seeing
their bodies hope you change...
He's a doomed CM for us...
Where are all the intelligence people?
He must have moved all of them to ACB...
lf l were a CM, attacks like
this will never happen.
l'll put myself first in the
line of fire, to save my people...
l don't have to be a CM...
To the families of all the people dead
in this incident, l promise a 10 lakhs..
Sir, Dhanunjay is calling
you an inefficient CM...
What do you have to say about it?
This is a brutal attack by the terrorists
and people are in a state of panic...
And l am not here to
make foolish statements...
l am the CM...
Powerful bomb explosion rips
through Lumbini Park..
..killing 32 people and
severely injuring 120...
CM has called for an
emergency meeting and..
..he'll be addressing people
through media in sometime from now...
Mr.Home Minister... What do we do now?
We'll order for an enquiry...
Announce a compensation of 5 lakhs
for dead and 2 lakhs for injured...
-We'll bear all the medical expenses...
-That's it?
We'll divert the issue by having
a protest rally accusing Pakistan.
The issue will get diverted.
Mr.Home Minister...
What is population of our city?
80 lakhs sir..
Our police force?
8000 sir...
With fewer forces in place, we are
toothless in defending our own citiens..
We have been asking for this to happen...
You don't need bullet proof jackets...
You need conviction...
lt's the same reaction every time...
Giving compensation, ordering
for an enquiry and accusing Pakistan...
Since you are not accountable to people,
you are not bothered about them...
People are too busy
with their own problems...
They don't expect to be
bombed by terorists...
They believe that the
Govt will protect them...
And we've failed them...
Shouldn't we be ashamed of ourselves?
lt's a central issue sir...
So, we don't have to do anything...
Then, what's your responsibility?
Revamp all the buildings in city
troubled areas, with 5000 crores...
Start a new Police Academy
with 10,000 crores, upgrade all weapons...
ln next 2 years, hire
50,000 police personal...
But one thing,
Every penny has to be accounted for...
Accounting every penny?
This is a very big project sir...
You take 10% commission...
Or take 20%...
Hello Chinna... buy 1000 acres
in Shamirpet near our land...
We are setting up police academy there...
Don't be so emotional sir...
They'll do business with everything...
We will speak later the remaining matters.
Sir, We've information...
Dhanunjay has met peddaina...
You have to do something sir...
l'll meet peddaina tomorrow...
Will not allow those crooks
to take over the power...
-What is it?
-Mom... l am going to meet Peddaina
Why at this hour?
l don't have any other way...
All the MLAs are revolting...
They are supporting Dhanu...
l'll beg him to save my Govt.
Be careful
See you mom...
You are on T.V...
You seem to be tense...
Many young kids were killed...
Dhanu is exploiting the situation...
And media is also not being supportive...
l was also angry with you...
l mean, you left in a hurry that's why...
Should l tell you something?
You are the best CM...
All politicians pretend to be leaders...
But, you are not like them...
There is lot of honesty in you...
That's why... you are the best...
Archana, will you come with me?
l mean, l am on my way
to village to meet Peddaina...
Should you ask?
Or mine..?
lt means not interested..?
or Not willing..?
Or hurting..?
ls it the silence of euphony?
ls it the writings over water?.
When stars go the distance,
there will be the sky
lf tears flow down,
it may be the lightning
There will be joy at dawn
where earth and sky meets
When l come near you,
why do you move away?
l've got you as my company
And our glance has met together
l've got you as my accompany
And our glance has met together
ls it for this, oh Priya?
ls it for this?
This is the village which was
destroyed by my family
Are you cray?
This is the kind of welcome
Sanjeevayya's son deserves...
Ask him, Why he's here?
He must have come to beg us for votes...
No not for votes...
l've come to meet you people...
just get lost.
We have seen many people.
We don't want to meet you... lf you
come back, we'll hurl shoes at you..
Let's go...
Archana you freshen up...
But, why did you come in between?
l deserve this...
You are our CM...
And we should be protecting you
l can't cheat her Ali...
She's a very nice girl...
-l feel guilty...
-Sir, what's this?
We are already late...
We'll are losing it sir...
The party is meeting tomorrow...
Don't be emotionally right now...
Sir, just go and propose her...
She likes you a lot...
That's the problem...
What to do?
Ali, l can't cheat her...
l will tell her the truth
and ask for her help
What if she doesn't agree?
No Ali... she'll be fine and she'll agree...
-Sir...
-Believe me
Look at the list of the
demands they've made
The reserve bank will go bankrupt
to fulfill all the demands...
Guess you've been roaming
around the whole village?
lnstead of coming home directly,
why did you go to the dalit ghettos?
lts okay, go and take a shower.
We'll have lunch...
Make arrangements for his shower...
l am fine... l don't need a shower...
You don't have to tell me...
You've been to an untouchables place...
You being to S.S and being a CM,
doesn't change things here...
Go take a shower and come.
ln 60 years of independent lndia...
Sntouchablity
This is barbarism and how dare...
Are these people governing us?
Are they the ones in power?
Am l supporting these kinds of people?
No! l should take them to task...
They don't have the right to govern us...
This is injustice...
They don't even have the right to live...
Ali, get me a good diamond ring...
l'm proposing to Archana today itself...
You were right...
lf we take it easy, these demons
will come back to loot us...
-Hi CM...
-Why do you call like that?
When l find you very cute,
l'll call you that...
Haven't you slept yet?
-No... Waiting
-Did you eat?
No... Waiting
-Let's go
-Come...
l need to say something to you...
Even l need to tell you something...
Let me say it first
l'll close my eyes and say it...
l've been waiting for you
to say this to me...
But you are taking lot of time...
So, l think it's about time
one of us says it...
lnstead of wasting time,
l thought l'll say it...
Come on, what kind of a CM are you?
l closed my eyes and opened
my heart to say, l love you...
You didn't even give me a kiss...
Everyone calls you a jeans CM...
But, you're a dumb CM...
Come...
Actually l hate politicians but,
l never thought that l'll end up with one...
Your dad is also a politician
l meant to ask whether
you told him about us
l told my mom... so.
l haven't talked to him for past 12 years
Then you should talk to him now...
This is the best occasion...
Here talk to him...
You'll feel happy...
He'll feel happy...
Let's not talk about him now Arjun, please
Talk to him its okay...
l dialed the number...
Who's this?
-Hello dad...
-Hello Archana..!
Where are you calling from?
ls everything fine?
Dad... l am planning to get married...
-Getting married?
-Who's he? ls he a good guy?
-He's a good guy...
-What does he do?
-You know him dad
-l know him?
He's CM dad...
CM?
Do you mean our CM Arjun?!
Let's welcome the spring
to sprout your desires
Let the woes which
came as promises, vanish
Let swing the comet in the hairdo
Let forget the sufferings in romance
l got the truth
lt rained, bloomed
and the thunder bolt came
Does it mean yes..
or No..?
Or mine..?
Archana madam...
Due to security reasons,
we are shifting from here...
-Please pack your baggage...
-ls everything fine?
-Where's the CM?
-He's coming...
-Get your luggage and we'll leave...
-2 minutes
-No signal right? -Yes, nobody will
be able to reach her on cell...
l've checked myself...
We'll start once
she's here with her luggage..
lt's ok... l'll hold it
Ali let's go...
-l'll be back in 2 or 3 hours
-Where are you going?
Going to meet Peddaina, to have a meeting
The security will be here don't worry
Her phone signal is blocked right?
Nobody will be able to reach
her till the party meeting is over...
She'll never forgive me...
Sir... lf she knows you well enough,
she'll never desert you...
9'o clock, meeting with Munuswamy
And at 10, party meeting right?
-ls everything ok?
-Ok
Sir... Mr.Munuswamy...
Hello Mr.Son-in-law!
-l mean... Mr. CM!
-Please sit
Sir... actually
As long as l am here, nobody
will be able to bring you down...
Let them do what they want to, we'll see
What was their offer to you sir?
Forget about it...
We are a family now...
They offered...
to make Deputy CM as the CM
10,000 crores share from the 1 lakh crores
2 cabinet berths...
And lot of other stuff...
-But, l just need one favour
-Tell me
My party member Buchiramayya's son..
..should be cleared from
the murder & rape case...
What are you thinking about?
He's a very important member of our party
-He can make or break our party
-Can we settle this with money?
lt's not about money here...
lf we don't release his son,
we'll have lot of problems
just a minute sir...
Sir... sir... accept it sir...
We are running out of time...
How can l protect a criminal,
who ruined a girl's life?
They're very poor people Mr.Sharma...
They live in forests...
They pleaded me for help,
l gave them my word
But sir, all our efforts will go to vain...
1 lakh crores of PEOPLES' FSND
will go into those crooks hands
We don't have a choice sir...
Sir... Accept it...
Don't hesitate, sir...
Mr. Sharma, l'll never forgive
myself for this in my life
l've never come across a CM like this...
-Have anyone of you come across?
-No... No... We haven't...
He abuses our own MLAs
in the Assembly house...
Doesn't have any respect for the party?
Moreover, he sends lncome Tax notices
to our MLAs and their family members
No scheme... No policy...
No new programme... No project proposal
And what did he really do
for the last one year?
Everyday
He acts like a money-mongering devil...
1 Lakh crores! 1 Lakh crores!
That's it!
From being a CM, he's stooped down
to being a collection agent!
What a shame!
Do we really need a CM like this?
No... no!... we don't
The respect you have for Mr. Sanjeevayya...
Hope you've understood
what politics is all about...
lt's a game of snakes and ladders...
Had you left to S.S,
you wouldn't have had these problems..
You stuck in it now...
Snless he destroys you, he'll not rest...
Sncle...
ln politics, you can buy people
with money, caste or relationship..
Till now, l was buying with money...
Now, l'm buying with relationship...
Basically buying is common
Ask him to come to point
without wasting time...
l propose the Deputy CM as our new CM
Hello Peddaina... Munuswamy here...
lf you want my support
You are not getting it Mr. Munuswamy...
He is fooling you and
your daughter as well...
Your daughter will tell the truth,
what's her number?
Everyone is not like you Mr. Dhanunjay...
What do you want sir?
We've settled everything right?
What's your problem now?
lf 10 is not okay?
Take 20 thousand crores...
Take 3 more portfolios...
But, Arjun should not be the CM!
l don't mind even if a Dog
becomes next CM...
What the hell are you talking?
Peddaina, you make him understand...
just get one thing clear...
lf you want my support
My son-in-law... Arjun should be the CM
To hell with you and your son-in-law!
You are nothing without us?
And you support your damn son-in-law!
You are a street dog that
feeds on our biscuits!
Mind your damn tongue!
Respect! Be careful
To hell with your respect
Dhanu... what the hell?
lf Munuswamy withdraws his support,
we need to face elections...
Shall we?
What took you so long?
And there was no signal to call you...
Hey, any problem?
Hey, signal is back...
Archana don't pick up...
Hello Miss Archana...
This is Dhanunjay...
Lie... lt was all a lie right?
Everything was a big lie right?
Archana my love for you is not a lie...
Mom always told me
not to believe politicians...
She must be sad for me up
in the heaven now...
Was this ploy needed?
Being a CM, why did you use..
...this ploy to cheat a
simple girl like me?
lf you had asked me,
l would have supported you...
Archana... please listen to me...
l am fighting...
l am fighting for a cause, to spend
the people's money for the people...
All the courts, laws and
politicians are against me...
But, l am still fighting...
ln this fight, l don't know
what's right
...and what's wrong and l've
forgotten about my own self...
You are thinking that, l've cheated you...
But the truth is... l've cheated myself...
There was no other way...
l couldn't risk...
l couldn't take a risk
with people's money...
Every politician who doesn't have
a conscience says the same thing...
For the want of power, money
or for the family,..
..every politician says the same thing...
Get lost Arjun...
l got the truth
Don't worry... l will not talk
about this with anybody
lt rained, got bloomed
and thunder bolt came
Go away...
-Yes... who are you?
-l'm Ramu
MLA Buchiramaiah's son
You called for me sir...
Frankly tell me...
Confidential
Did you murder her?
We were drunk sir...
We were in a good mood...
Saw a hot girl, we just had fun...
And murder?
She was creating a lot of fuss...
Was very stubborn...
She was not ready to compromise...
We offered her a lot of money...
Will leave now...
A small request...
Dad is hosting a party...
Celebrating my release...
You should surely come sir
lf your dad wasn't an MLA,
Or if l didn't help you,
Do you even realie
what punishement you'd have got?
But, why wouldn't you help us sir...
All of us are together in this...
You help us and we help you... its mutual...
Any regret...
Do you at least regret
for what you've done...
Why should l regret sir?
lt'll stay in public memory for 2 days
They'll forget about it...
They'll find a new case...
Not about you...
-Do you regret for her life?
-Nothing sir
She's a small fish but, a beautiful fish...
Ramu come here
Since your dad is an MLA,
you got away with it...
At least, remember this!
Go
Out!
Mom..!
What is it?
Come here..
What happened?
Mom..!
What is it son?
Mom.. Today to save my position,
l let off a criminal who
destroyed a girl's life...
l didn't have a choice mom...
You've done injustice to a girl?
l just let off a criminal mom...
lf you think you've just let off
a criminal, it's okay...
But, by letting him off,
you've done injustice to a girl...
And that's what is sad, very sad...
Now, you decide whether
you're okay with it or sad about it...
l didn't have a choice mom...
Dad also used to say
the same thing...
lt's not like that mom...
lt's the same thing...
Today it's a rape case...
Tomorrow it'll be a murder case...
Next it'll be about a factory license...
After that it'll be about a land...
Like that you'll not have
a choice in anything...
Arjun, go to sleep now...
We'll talk about this tomorrow...
Take some rest... go...
l always wanted you
to be a LEADER, not a politician..
Mom...
Arjun, dear.
Oh gosh..!
This is the land of women..
..-their milk flows to make
the land virtuous. -Mom!
We've owned this nation.
Praise it, my brother!
Many women from different villages
have come to see your mother sir...
lf you can meet them once...
lf you can just meet them for a minute...
1 lakh women sir...
All Poor and helpless...
All these years, your mother supported them
and gave them a new lease of life sir..
Let the nation's glory spreads to all
-She's a God to them sir...
Let the nation history shines
-One lakh women...
Oh my brother,
sing about the freedom-fighters..
..who have got forgotten.
Oh my brother,
sing about the freedom-fighters..
..who have got forgotten.
These is the land of women lives
..their milk flows to make virtue the land
We've owned this nation.
Praise for it, my brother!
We've owned this nation.
Praise for it, my brother!
People are dying Arjun...
They're tired of these politicians...
Give them a small hope Arjun...
l always wanted you to be a Leader,
not a politician...
Please sit...
lt's okay..
You sit down...
lt's ok!
You please be seated.
l am the CM...
-Who's this girl?
-Victim's sister...
She was too scared to stay alone at home
So l got her along sir...
lt was a mistake on our part,
in your elder daughter's case...
You tell me, how can we correct it?
He's a criminal...
And he should be punished, that's it sir...
Nothing more can be done...
Will l get back my daughter?
We'll leave now sir...
-We won't get a bus if it gets too dark...
-Just a minute...
l too lost someone...
You all stay with me...
l'll take care of her education...
Will get her married...
-l'll take care of her like my own sister...
-No sir...
Why?
CM himself is promising you...
We don't trust him sir...
Please don't mind...
CM himself is giving his word...
CM himself went back on his word...
We don't trust him anymore sir...
The MLA from our village...
He will soon be a minister too...
Who'll make him understand?
That he should treat the girls of his
village, as his own daughters...
When they brutally raped
and killed my daughter...
Your CM shamelessly defended those beasts...
That's what you people are...
We've completely lost trust
in you people sir...
l'll at least drop you in my car...
No thank you sir...
We'll go in the bus...
There will be people around, it's safer...
Can we do justice to him?
Legally we can't do anything...
Not legally Smesh...
As a friend, do me a favour
Mr. Sharma
ln half an hour, pass orders
to our 2000 officers...
At sharp 6'o clock in the
morning tomorrow, start raiding!
Every MLA, MP, every so-called
public representative, raid everyone!
Don't leave anyone
Their family, friends, everyone!
Mr. Smesh, you provide them
with complete police protection
Sir... but...
Mr. Sharma, we can't
confiscate their property,..
..but we can show their
illegal earnings to the people...
Run hourly news scrolls on TV...
-What about government? -We don't
have to worry about it Mr. Sharma..
Take an appointment
with governor at 8 p.m tomorrow...
By 8 p.m, all raids should be completed...
Mr. Smesh, l want him dead at 8:10...
A CM shouldn't be unlawful, right?
Sir please think about it again...
A CM, who couldn't do justice
to an innocent poor girl,..
..doesn't deserve to remain a CM...
l am an incompetent CM,
in an incompetent system!
This is not what the people
want Mr.Sharma...
Crores of funds, big projects,
food or electricity
This is not what the people want
People want Change!
Change in the System!
Change in the ldeologies!
Change in Politics!
Ali, let's go
l see a true LEADER in you sir!
This country has never seen
a true LEADER like you sir...
GEMlNl NEWS. ln a way never
seen before in the history of the state,
Today at 6 a.m, ACB raided all MLAs
and public representatives houses...
Surpassing the total amount of black money
collected in the past 7 months,
just for one day today, the black money
collected in raids was Rs.80,000 Crores
For the first time in independent lndia,
impossible seems to be possible...
And the dream has come true...
Proving that nobody is above the law,..
..including the politicians
and public representatives...
The total black money unearthed
in the raidings today,..
..has left not only the state
but the entire country shocked!
Chief Minister Arjun Prasad had
resigned just some time back...
He will meet the governor tonight at 8
and submit his resignation letter...

You've destroyed it in a jiffy...
Wasn't it your government?
Then, why did you do this Arjun?
We can't make the dead walk Peddaina...
We'll have to bury them...
You guys are not right...
People don't need politicians like you...
lf l start listening to you or
lf l continue living in this ambience or
lf l follow your ideologies
Change will not be possible...
lnstead, we'll go 100 years backwards...
That's why; l am going away from you...
ln search of a new world!
Sir... Please sign this...
This is our manifesto...
Manifesto?
lt's about how we intend
to spend people's money for the people...
Do we really need a manifesto
to spend people's money for the people?
We've been doing it for the past 60 years
did it ever work out?
Our manifesto will not be about how
we spend the
PEOPLES' FSND for people...
Decorate the garland
to our Motherland of Telugu
Offer prayers to our
Motherland who begot us
With a wealthy heart..
Show kindness to everyone
Let them live rich
