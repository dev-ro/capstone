Stop it.
Stop it!
Put on your fucking seatbelt!
﻿Can you move your hands for me?
﻿Now lift your arms.
﻿Watch out for any neurological signs.
﻿Motor function, coordination, diction.
﻿As you know.
﻿Could the plate move in her head?
﻿No.
﻿Not without violent impact.
﻿It's very solid.
﻿It's titanium.
﻿Get off me, asshole!
﻿Hands off, sir.
Touch with your eyes.
﻿Alexia!
﻿Can I get a selfie?
﻿I'm Justine.
﻿Wait! Don't move.
﻿Hang on, I got it.
﻿So what's your name?
﻿Do you beep at security?
﻿No. Imagine having to flash cops
before every flight.
﻿Does it hurt?
﻿Not at all.
﻿- We're waiting!
- Can't you see we're busy?
﻿- You said it didn't hurt.
- Yanking always hurts!
﻿Alexia, an autograph please.
﻿Thanks.
﻿I'm done.
﻿Alexia!
﻿Alexia, please. Just an autograph.
﻿Sorry, but
I waited three hours...
﻿We met at the boat show
in Marseille. Remember?
﻿No, sorry. Good night.
﻿Wait!
﻿Can I get a kiss goodbye?
﻿Sorry- 1 'ust wanted to say.
﻿I think I'm in love with you.
﻿You probably think I'm crazy.
﻿I doubt you feel the same.
﻿But maybe we could be friends,
﻿and then see?
﻿What do you think?
﻿The Adrien Legrand case is back
in the news, 10 years to the day
﻿since the boy went missing
in the Paris region.
﻿The mystery remains.
﻿Due to a lack of new evidence,
the attorney general
﻿has closed the case.
﻿The nightmare continues for the family...
﻿...the fire has been contained,
﻿but the damage is considerable.
﻿The campsite was destroyed
﻿along with nearby houses.
﻿A wave of panic grips the South,
﻿after the discovery of
another corpse this Thursday.
﻿A 47-year-old man
﻿is the fourth victim this year.
﻿Two other men and a woman were murdered
﻿in similar circumstances.
﻿The police
are asking the public
to remain calm
﻿and reinforcing their presence
on the ground.
﻿The hypothesis of a serial killer
is not yet official,
﻿but the call for witnesses
should shed some light.
﻿The police are getting calls
from throughout France...
﻿- You ok?
- My belly hurts.
﻿- Your period?
- I'm not always on the rag.
﻿Whatever.
Ask your dad to examine you.
﻿- It's nothing. - Wait, here.
﻿First time with a girl?
﻿You can move down, you know.
﻿What the fuck?
﻿Stop, it hurts!
﻿Whatever.
﻿Coming?
﻿Are you kidding me?
﻿Fuck!
﻿What's wrong?
﻿Tell me.
﻿So what is it?
﻿Crazy you didn't feel it sooner.
﻿What do you think you're doing?
﻿Romain? What's going on?
﻿Call the cops! Now!
﻿Sorry, is the bathroom occupied?
﻿How many of you are there?
﻿What do you mean?
﻿There's Cri-Cri, Romu,
﻿Juju and me.
﻿Are more coming
﻿Hope not.
﻿I'm Alex.
﻿Jerome.
Or Jupi, to my friends.
﻿Who'd you come with?
﻿Are you ok?
﻿I'm so wiped.
﻿I can lend you my bed.
﻿Hey, last stop.
I'm not going any farther.
﻿Maybe just a little farther?

﻿We're looking.
﻿Are you ok?
﻿You don't have to say anything.
﻿Just nod or shake your head if you like.
﻿We'll doaDNAtest.
- What for?
﻿Think I can't recognize
my own son?
﻿Accident on Route 389 .
﻿Death on scene-
﻿You haven't said a word.
﻿Can't you say something?
﻿Never mind.
You'll talk when you're ready.
﻿Anyone hurts you, I kill 'em.
﻿Got it?
﻿Even if it's me.
﻿I'd kill myself, I swear.
﻿Captain!
﻿I saved you some dinner.
﻿After your long trip.
﻿That's nice, thanks.
﻿This is Adrien, my son.
﻿He's my son.
﻿Adrien, meet Rayane.
﻿Conscience.
﻿Everyone calls me that.
﻿Go get some sleep, it's late.
﻿It's okay, I'm not on duty.
﻿Right.
﻿But we're tired.
﻿Of course. I know.
﻿So, good night.
﻿You too, Adrien.
﻿Captain?
﻿I'm happy for you.
﻿Just came to say good night.
﻿Sleeping in your clothes?

﻿Stay put.
﻿Turn around.
﻿Show me.
﻿There.
﻿You're starting to look decent.
﻿Hey.
﻿Who's that?
﻿You'll see.
﻿Guys, the Captain's checking on us.
﻿Is he some retard
who wants to live the dream?
﻿For real? No, he's normal.
﻿You know,
like for some TV special?
﻿Know what I mean? - Sure.
﻿But what the fuck?
﻿- Seriously.
He's normal!
﻿No, he's weird.
﻿- Got a problem?
- No, Captain, just getting acquainted.
﻿We'll take him to see the trucks.
﻿A little advice, take it or leave it.
﻿Fireman Legrand is my son.
﻿And who am I to you?
I'm God.
﻿So he's not only your brother,
﻿he's Jesus.
﻿Jesus will speak when
he has something to say.
﻿And we'll listen. Got it?
﻿Hey! Got it?
﻿Yes, Captain.
﻿That's better.
﻿Turns out Jesus is white and gay
﻿Captain says believe, you believe.
﻿C'mon, stop brown-nosing.
﻿Rayane! Get down!
﻿Four minutes on the stopwatch, Captain.
﻿Take the kitchen.
I got the bedroom.
﻿Copy.
﻿Something wrong, Captain?
﻿Control!
﻿I don't get it.
All looks normal.
﻿Okay, end simulation.
﻿Will you ever speak?
﻿Just say "yes" like a normal person!
﻿Even parrots can say yes!
﻿No need to be human.
﻿Even my phone says yes. Look.
﻿- Say yes.
﻿See? 20 euros for that shit.
﻿What's that?
﻿Show me.
﻿Do I scare you?
﻿I won't hurt you.
﻿I just want to see.
﻿Show me.
﻿Hang on!
﻿Stay, please.
You'll see. Stay.
﻿What's that?
﻿What's that for?
﻿You in a knitting club?
﻿Wanna fight? Yeah?
﻿Go on, fight like a man.
﻿Fight like a man
﻿Go on.
﻿Why do you always want to leave?
﻿You're already home.
﻿Here.
﻿I brought back two or three hoes. Biggest asses you ever saw!
﻿Bitches be twerking, like...
﻿Just give me a hole.
Black, Arab, whatever!
﻿A hole is a hole!
﻿I don't care, bring it on.
﻿Hey, girl!
﻿I'm talking to you! You hear me?
﻿Girl!
﻿Chill.
Just wanna talk to you.
﻿\Ne won't hurt you.
﻿Forget talking.
Be direct, bruh.
﻿I'd turn her around
and shove it in her ass.
﻿Pussy, mouth, wherever she wants.
﻿Even in her ear, bruh.
﻿Hey, slut!
﻿We say two words and
they think we wanna gang bang.
﻿We're talking to you! Turn around!
﻿She thinks she's a star.
﻿Go see her, grow some balls!
﻿Go see her! Go on!
﻿Dad?
﻿Wake up, Dad.
﻿Dad.
﻿Adrien?
﻿Adrien?
﻿Adrien, are you up
﻿What... what are you doing?
﻿Come. Come.
﻿Sit down.
﻿They can't tell me you're not my son.
﻿He usually takes a sleeping pill, but...
﻿he always wakes up in the morning, so...
﻿I waited until 10, but...
﻿at this point...
﻿I don't know.
﻿He must've taken one too many by accident.
﻿Anyway...
I hope I didn't bother you for nothing.
﻿I mean, I hope I did!
﻿You know what I mean.
﻿Did you go see?
﻿No! I never go in his room.
﻿He could be with a girlfriend.
I leave him alone.
﻿How old is your son?
﻿Forty-five.
﻿Don't speak or touch anything. Just watch.
﻿Your usual.
﻿Open up, honey. I'm with...
﻿Allow me, ma'am.
﻿Stay. You were upgraded.
﻿So enjoy the show.
﻿Rayane, we need to intubate, now.
﻿What's wrong? He's not breathing?
﻿Adrien, help us!
﻿Do you think he did it on purpose?
﻿He didn't mean to..
﻿Help me.
﻿Fuck, now she's croaking
﻿Get backup.
﻿Adrien, check her breathing.
﻿That's my role.
﻿Move it! Move!
﻿Press her thorax 30 times.
﻿Then plug her nose and blow into her mouth.
﻿Then start over.
﻿Look at me.
Know the Macarena?
﻿We'll sing it together.
﻿Follow me.
﻿Press as hard as you can.
﻿Blow or she dies! Blow!
﻿Go again.
﻿Blow.
﻿Go again.
﻿- He got her. Rayane, take over. - Move.
﻿Ma'am?
﻿Wake up, ma'am
﻿Go.
﻿Where you from, for real?
﻿I'm listening.
﻿It's about your son.
﻿\Ne don't talk about my son.
﻿It's important.
﻿Don't talk about my son. Ever.
﻿Crawl back into the hole you came from!
﻿You hear me?
﻿Can't you feel the energy?
﻿Between you and me?
﻿Mom's here.
﻿Not gonna kiss him?
﻿How are you doing?
﻿Are you adapting?
﻿Not too lost here? - He doesn't talk.
﻿I looked it up, it's normal.
﻿Am I allowed to talk to him?
﻿Sure, go ahead.
﻿But he's fine here.
﻿Go ahead.
﻿We could go somewhere.
﻿Just us two.
﻿How do you do it?
﻿Living here, next to his empty room.
﻿His toys, his clothes... Must be hell.
﻿His smell still permeates the walls.
﻿Why inflict that on yourself?
﻿Give us a minute, please, honey.
﻿I won't let you take him.
﻿I don't want him, Vincent.
﻿Stop!
﻿Please, please...
﻿Stop, stop...
﻿Please, stop.
﻿you were me?
﻿If you couldn't mourn your kid,
what would you do?
﻿You poor thing.
﻿You poor, poor thing.
What mess did you get yourself in?
﻿Whatever your twisted reasons
for exploiting his fucking folly,
﻿I don't care, just take care of him.
﻿Look at me.
﻿You take care of him.
﻿He needs someone, you or another.
﻿Say it.
﻿Still no trace of the young woman
suspected in the series of murders
﻿that has shaken the South this year.
﻿The 32-year-old dancer...
﻿Adrien, can you come?
﻿Help me, please.
﻿Wait!
﻿Come help me, please.
﻿Here.
﻿I'm sick of twisting.
Shoot straight into the muscle.
﻿Then press down.
﻿Avoid bruises, if you pity your dad.
﻿Are you sick?
﻿No.
I'm old.
﻿Stop!
﻿Sorry.
﻿I take care of you.
Not the other way round.
﻿Sit down.
﻿Do you trust me?
﻿We'll make it grow.
﻿Get down!
﻿- You okay?
- Yeah.
﻿- Dizzy?
﻿- Blurry vision?
﻿What's my name?
- Get me up!
﻿No.
﻿What's my name?
﻿And her? Know her name?
﻿They need you in back, Captain.
﻿We secure and retreat?
﻿Only one? Is it secured?
﻿Captain!
Should we secure it first?
﻿Hold this.
﻿I'm sorry.
﻿Are you okay?
﻿I don't care who you are.
﻿You're my son.
﻿You'll always be my son.
﻿Whoever you are.
﻿Is that clear?
﻿Adrien! Adrien!
﻿Go for it!
﻿C'mon guys, shut it down! Seen the time?
﻿What are you doing?
﻿I love you.
﻿I love you too.
﻿Don't go, please!
I'm scared, don't leave me!
﻿Push.
﻿Push harder.
﻿Look at me. Look at me!
﻿You'll be okay.
I'm here.
﻿Push hard, Adrien.
﻿My name's Alexia.
﻿Push hard, Alexia.
﻿Push!
﻿How is it?
﻿Alexia...
﻿Alexia!
﻿I'm here.
Stay with me.
﻿Alexia?
﻿I'm here.
﻿I'm here.
﻿I'm here.
