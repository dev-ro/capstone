Look, I'm very sorry, sir.
Guess what I'm trying
to understand is
What is the reason for
this delay exactly?
Yeah.
Specifically?
Mr. Plotkin, I'm so sorry.
But it's just that
when we-we set out...
Yeah, we closed in November.
We had all
the permit applications in
before the end of the year.
Right.
Once we get
the final stamp of approval...
And we can't get
the trucks here a little early?
Just, you know,
get 'em started?
Miami Beach ordinances
won't let me do that.
Is anyone actually
enforcing those right now?
Look, Mr. Plotkin, I know that
you're eager to move in.
Okay?
Once we get the final

No. Uh...

Drinking it

Hey, drink what you like.
No judgment.
Uh, you have a Hamm's?
I'll have one of those.

did you just order?
Oh, it's a nice one,
out of Milwaukee.
Good quality.
50 cents a can before markup.
Come on, Kitty.
Forget about price.
Get him a Heineken.
Thank you. It's on me.
Thanks, man. Thank you.
That's nice.
I'll have a Hamm's.

Thank you.
Please.
Thank you, Ruby.

Oh, yeah. Okay.
Uh... up and down.
Yeah.
How's your asshole brother?
Still an asshole.
Okay.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.
Keep busy at least?
Uh, got the day job
at MassMutual.
Working on my portfolio.
That's the last thing
you should be worrying about
right now.
Why? It's a...
it's a good distraction.
Let me take that
over for you.
We got thousands of analysts
at B of A
that do just this.
All good, man.
Thank you.
Come on, Kitty.
You should be focused
on your family right now,
not fucking around
with penny stocks.
They're not all penny stocks.
GameStop isn't a penny stock.
[CHUCKLES]
GameStop? Dude.
You used to love GameStop.
Yeah, then I grew up.
Well, I think it's undervalued.
[SCOFFS]
I just sold off a bunch of
other shit to double down.
How much are we talking?
A grand?
Fifty.
Bucks?
Grand. 53 grand.
[LAUGHS]
Yeah.
Kitty.
Man, you don't even
own a house.
It's got a ton
of short interest,
which is artificially...
You got a one-year-old.
...pushing the price down.
Jesus, bro.
You never bet against
Wall Street.
Wall Street gets it wrong
all the time.
Look at '08.
That was a one-off, Kitty.
These guys,
they have all the money
and the fancy degrees and the
political juice in the world,
and they get it wrong
all the time.
Are you out of
your fucking mind?
They got the advantage,
and they still get it wrong.
[STAMMERS]
No, give me that.
I'm drinking it,
even if it's 50 cents.
It's four bucks.
Well, my man just spent 53K
on a penny stock,
so all he can afford is water.
You're a Wall Street guy?
Very much no.
I'm a Wall Street guy.
What was the stock?
GameStop.
The video game store
at the mall.
You really bought
$53,000 of it?
Yeah, I don't believe it.
I think he's fucking with us.
You're fucking with us, right?
You don't even have 50 grand.
Let's see.
RUBY:
Oh, shit.
How is she falling for this?
How are you falling for this?
He won't spend five bucks

GameStop.
The most compelling asymmetric
opportunity in the market?
What? Did Briggsy
make you jumpy?
A little.
What was his argument?
He didn't have one.
Well...
He just said
it was a reckless bet.
He said, "You're putting your

Enough. Fuck Briggsy.
Babe, you literally know

Yo, what up, everybody?
Roaring Kitty here.
Uh, I've done
a few of these now,
mostly on
my investing methodology.
Uh, but today I'm gonna try
something a little different.
I appreciate the feedback
you guys have been leaving me,
by the way.
Uh... Oh.
More feedback coming in hot.
"Less cats."
Okay.
Great.
[LAUGHS]
Uh, uh, like I was saying...
Uh, what was I saying?
Uh, I'm gonna try...
Oh, and here's one from Ballz.
"Nerd"?
And "nerd" is in all capitals.
Like, okay,
that's kind of mean.
[CHUCKLES]
But, okay, fair.
Uh, "Nice shirt, Grandpa"?
What?
How old do you think I am?
[CHUCKLES]
You know what?
Thanks for the comments.
Uh, we're gonna come back
to them at the end.
Here's what I want
to talk about.
Uh, I'm gonna pick a stock
and talk about
why I think it's interesting.
And that stock is...
...GameStop.
[CHUCKLES]
Uh...
I know it's a polarizing stock
and some of you are probably
gonna tune out of the stream
right now when you hear I'm
bullish on GameStop, but I am.
You can see it is now
the biggest position by far
in the Roaring Kitty portfolio.
So, yeah, I think
everyone else is crazy,
and I think I'm right,
but I've been wrong
plenty of times in the past,
so... [CHUCKLES]
Uh, so there are a lot of
aspects to this bull thesis,
a lot of moving parts,
but I boil it down
to what I consider
the three overs:
The digital risks
seem to me to be overblown,
the negative sentiment
is overdone--
you can see it
with the huge short interest--
and the value is overlooked.
Wall Street
just doesn't see it.
Why?
Mr. Market, why?
The hedge funds are overlooking
the value in the company
just like they overlook
the people who shop there.
They assume most people
download games online now.
But, look, 25% of gamers still
buy new discs from GameStop,
and 40% buy used games
from the store.
And the market's
kind of forced my hand here.
What more can I say?
I just like the stock.
DONALDSON:
Hey!
[GRUNTS]
Shit!
Oh, did I wake you?
It's okay, Mr. Donaldson.
Mr. Donaldson,
I need you in your bed.
Kieran, can you please
make sure that Mr. Donaldson...
I don't need to go to bed.
I need a cup of coffee.
We can get you
a cup of coffee.
Kieran, coffee?
CHRIS:
Oh.
Well, isn't that beautiful?
JENNY:
Oh, shit.
[CHRIS LAUGHS]
CHRIS:
"100% short GameStop stock,
GME"?
It's an investment video.
Hey, Jenny, for real,
I wouldn't take
investment advice
from a guy in a cat shirt.
Oh, okay. Who do you take
investment advice from?
I don't have investments.
Mm-hmm.
And if I did, I'd listen
to, like...
[BREATHES DEEPLY]
a banker.
Just the way
they like it.
"They."
[LAUGHING]
Oh, boy. Here we go.
Just never mind.
No, no, no, please tell me.
I'm dying to know
what Luke Wilson
from "The Royal Tenenbaums"
thinks we should do
with our $68,000 a year.
Who from what?
Ugly Björn Borg.
JENNY:
Okay, fine. Wall Street
is betting that
this company is gonna fail.
It's called shorting.
And if it fails, well,
then everybody loses their job,
but these hedge fund assholes
make a shit ton of money.
It's bullshit.
It's a bullshit way
for rich people to get richer.
[LAUGHS]
How did you even
find this guy?
70,000 people
have watched this video.
He posts his balance sheets
and everything.
WallStreetBets is
going crazy over this.
Who?
It's an Internet forum.
Uh-huh.
On Reddit.
Oh, see. No, no, no.
I'm not gonna
do this with you.
The last time
you brought up Reddit,
it was just
all these oil paintings
of Donald Trump
on horseback.
You liked it.
Detestable.
Look.
Okay, yeah.
Let's-let's take a look.
Um, "Shit's not
a pump and dump
if it never dumps,
you fuckheads."
"Feed me your tears. I use it
as anal lube on your wives."
Okay, but why did you go
to that one?
CHRIS:
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
"Strap on your theta dildo
and start pounding."
Okay. Yes.
[LAUGHING]
That shit exists on here.
But I also learned
the difference between
a delta squeeze
and a gamma squeeze.
And now everyone's talking
about call options.
[SIGHS]
Jenny, baby, you're never
gonna find a man on there.
[SIGHS]
And you're never gonna date
Puff Daddy.
First of all, no one has said
"Puff Daddy" since the '90s,
and second of all,
this isn't Puff Daddy.
This is Loop Daddy.
JENNY:
Okay, well, whatever Daddy
he's called,
he's weird-looking.
Hey, well, my guy has, what,
five million TikTok followers?
How many does yours have?
I don't know.
Quick scroll.
412.
Who cares?

But, hey, least I aim high.

You're why I'm here
in the first place.
Uh...
It's fun to talk about.
I mean, I figure,
if I worked at a hedge fund,
I'd compare notes with
my colleagues, but I don't.
I'm stuck at home
like you guys, so, uh...
I believe in this stock.
And I believe
in this community.
Um...
I'll be honest.
Uh, it's been
kind of a shitty year.
Uh, for a lot of people.
Lot of people lost people
the past 12 months.
I did, too.
Uh, my sister, Sara.
Uh...
I don't talk about it much.
But it felt right to tell you.
Uh, we've been through
so much together.
You've made me feel a part
of something, something big.
So, uh, Merry Christmas.
Cheers.

Remember when you were

now you're literally obsessed?
No, I don't recall.
How much are you up?
948.
Stock dipped a little.
It was like 2,000
before Christmas.
Maybe you should sell.
No. It's not about the money.
The stock market
is not about the money?
No. You just got to read
some of the stuff on here.
Never understood why
my dad was so pissed off
about this whole thing,
but now I do.
I told you about
his store, right?
Costco?
Shopko.
It was, like, this, like,
big chain in our area.
My dad, he worked his way
all the way up
from bag boy
to general manager.
Then one of these Wall Street
funds came in, bought it
and vampire-sucked
all the money out of it
and then declared bankruptcy.
Fuck.
Yeah.
He lost his pension,
everything.
It's why he had to work
at Pick 'n fucking Save
until the day he died,
and now that's why
I'm up to my ass in debt.

But if you don't charge

how do you make money?
[SONG ENDS]
The idea for Robinhood
really came out of the
Occupy Wall Street movement.
All those people
with no way of getting in.
Is that what Occupy
was about?
I mean, were they trying
to get in or...?
So, we said
it's not enough to occupy.
We need to democratize
Wall Street.
Nat, I'm not sure
if you know this,
but Baiju and I

I-I was born in Bulgaria,

for a total of, uh...
Close to 20 at this point,
million.
NAT:
So, you're one of
these tech companies
that's exploded growth-wise
but doesn't make any money.
We make money.
But how?
If you don't charge
commission, then...
From interest
on people's accounts.
But your users
are mostly young.
So how much money
can they really
be keeping in their account?
There's also payment
for order flow.
What's that?
VLAD: We prefer the term
"stock order routing."
When you buy or sell stock
on our app,
we send your order to market
makers who process the order.
They pay us a tiny rebate
on every trade.
Tiny.
But it adds up.
We should really get back
to how we started our company.
What market maker
do you work with?
A few.
Citadel Securities mostly.

Well, Ken Griffin's hedge fund

You ever heard of

[WHISPERS]
Is that a sexual thing?
No.
[WOMAN WHOOPS]
Oh, yeah!
STEPHEN COLBERT:
Here-Here's what's going on.
Late last year, hedge funds
started shorting stock
in the retail store GameStop,
meaning they had bet against it
and needed it to drop in price
for their investments
to be successful.
Now, unfortunately
for the hedge funds,
small investors
started buying the stock,
led by something called
WallStreetBets,
a popular, juvenile,
foul-mouthed Reddit page.
And when WallStreetBets noticed
that hedge funds had taken
a large short position
in GameStop stock,
they decided to punish
the Wall Street big boys
and launched
a coordinated buying spree.
The revolutionaries on Reddit
are spanking Wall Street's ass.
GameStop shares
absolutely going nuts.
I think, um, it was up
over 70% at one point.
Massive short squeeze, closing
there with a gain of 51%...
KEITH:
Show me the tendies!

[LAUGHING]
Whoa!
Okay, now if you've been
watching this price action,
this is what I'm talking about.
Yeah, but you can really feel
that panic
from Wall Street, right?
When they start-starting
to feel a little squeeze.
Starting to feel--
You're starting to really feel
a little squeeze.
Oh, I need a drink.
I need a drink.
I know we all drinking tonight.
We fucking did it.

they-they-they halt trading

Address it all head-on.
It's gonna, it's gonna be good.
No.
Come on, Gabe.
We're on in ten seconds.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
Gabe, seriously.
Bye.
I'm terribly sorry.
Seriously, come on.
W-We're going on right now.
Good to see you. [MUMBLES]
YAARA:
Babe.
What's the damage?
[SIGHS]
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
[RINGTONE PLAYING]
Let me guess: you need cash.
[OVER SPEAKERPHONE]
Didn't call Ken first, did you?
He had Phillips reach out.
How much did he offer?
I haven't called him back yet.
Well, how much do you need?
You know what?
Don't answer that.
The number doesn't matter.
Whatever it is,
I'd love to buy in.
Tell Ken to fill in the rest.
Prick.
[CLEARS THROAT]
[PHONE RINGING AND VIBRATING]
GABE [OVER SPEAKERPHONE]:
Hey, Ken.
Hey.
Hi.
Um, so I might need...
uh...
a new investor.
Consider it done.
Just keep moving forward.
Don't think about what
Grandpa Melvin used to say.
[WHISPERS]
Prick.
Thank you.
NEWSMAN [VOICE-OVER]:
Both Citadel, uh, and Point72...
Poor guy. [CHUCKLES]
...have infused
three billion dollars
into, uh, Melvin Capital
to try to shore up...
Another goddamn bailout.
Can you believe this crap?
Nobody bailed me out
when Richard left me alone
with two toddlers, a mortgage,
a shit car that never works.
You can say "shit"
but we can't?
JENNY:
It's just so damn unfair,
and you know it.
All we've done
for the last year is
work our asses off
helping people,
and all we've gotten
is one $600 check.
This idiot effs up just about
as bad as anyone can eff,
and his friends come running in
with three billion dollars.
That's why I keep telling you
You're never gonna win.
Just take the money
and do something nice.
Pay off your mortgage.
Get that one braces.
Look who's still holding.
[SIGHS]
If he's in, I'm in.
Yeah, he's still
gonna need braces.
Your teeth are perfect.
So what? The stock's up $150?
How much higher is it gonna go?
We control the price now,
not Wall Street,
and no one on there is selling.
Shoes.
Ugh.
You're all so delusional.
JENNY:
Maybe, but look at
what we've managed to do
with these hedge funds.
If we keep
driving up the price,
maybe we'll scare
more of these guys
into closing out their shorts,
and then all of that
bailout money...
Wait.
...becomes ours.
Your screen name
is "StonkMom"?
Hey.
Help your mother.
Why me and not Keith?
Just shut up
and do it, okay?
Kev, take the potatoes.
'Cause you're rich now?
Mr. "$23 million on paper
but I won't sell."
Kevin, shh.
Loser says what?
What?
Kevin, let Keith tell them.
Tell us what?
Oh, uh, I was waiting
to tell you in person,
but the, uh, stock we bet on,
GameStop, is up.
Ah, good.
How much up?
He's up 23 million, Pop.
STEVE GILL:
You're an asshole.
Don't kid us.
Uh, it's-it's real.
Yeah, it's real,
and he's refusing to sell.
What is going on?
You're pulling our leg.
No. Your son's
a huge Internet celebrity now.
Millions of people,
including StonkMom,
thinks he's some, like-- I
don't know-- investment genius.
No, he is a genius.
No, he's not.
You're up 23 million?
[CHUCKLES]
And you're not selling?
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the fuck
is wrong with you?
Do you even know
how much $23 million is?
And you're just
gonna let it ride?
What's the matter with you?
I know what I'm doing, Dad.
ELAINE:
But why aren't you selling?
What-- wait. Is this illegal?
Are you in trouble?
No. No, he's not in trouble.
It's totally legal.
KEVIN: Yeah, he's posting
his balance sheet
on the Internet.
What?
Hedge fund managers,
they go on CNBC
all the time
to pump up a stock.
All I do is post my
balance sheet on WallStreetBets
after market close.
You post your balance sheet?
Yeah, the same idiot
who left a fresh pair of Nikes
out on the bleachers
for just anyone to take.
So you admit they were stolen.
We got to talk about this.
I admit you're a fucking moron.
Least I won the race.
What's the point
of winning the race
if you let some dipshit
steal the prize?
You would've broke a four
if you had the Zooms on.
A four-minute mile
isn't everything, Kevin.
Maybe we should
get in touch with Briggsy.
You know, he works in finance.
Yes.
CAROLINE: You think Briggsy
knows more about this
than Keith does?
Well, can you talk about
why you're putting your stocks
in "The Wall Street Journal"?
WallStreetBets.
What if somebody tries
to rob you, kidnap the baby?
No one's gonna kidnap the baby.
Nobody wants that baby, Mom.
STEVE GILL: I'm just saying
that if we're gonna
talk to somebody,
you need to talk to Briggsy.
ELAINE: Yes, honey.
This is the point I'm...
KEITH: Enough!
[CHATTER STOPS]
You guys, Keith has literally
poured his heart
and his soul into this
for the past year.
He knows what he's doing.
I know it's been
a tough time, Elaine.
[ELAINE CLEARS THROAT]
You should still sell.
[SIGHS]
Think you should sell.

You're worth hundreds of

and you're amassing
credit card debt.
You really are

No, babe, I'm all in.

Did you know that Gabe Plotkin
gave an interview?
He's been getting death threats

from these WSB guys.
It was ten comments.
There's always bad apples.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
And the moderators
deleted it right away.
You're just gonna ride

[IN ENGLISH] Hey.
Aw, man. [CHUCKLES]
Eight million people is real.

It's a joke.

It's not funny.

Look.
I got $175,000 in stock

[IN SPANISH]
Like, serious money,
like, I could get y'all a house
and get y'all up out of here
kind of money.
Uh-huh.
I bought call options,
for cheap.
And they hit.
[IN ENGLISH]
So now you're gonna sell?
Nah. No, I'm-a buy more.
[IN SPANISH]
When they hit,
I'm-a buy you a mansion.
It's gonna be crazy.

[SNORTS, CHUCKLES]
[SPEAKS SPANISH ANGRILY]
NEWSMAN:
Some breaking news right now
on what has turned into,
uh, the soap opera
and, uh, saga of the markets
right now,
and that is
the story of GameStop.
A month ago today,
it was trading at
about 20 bucks per share.
Two days ago, it was under $80.
Today, nearly $350 a share.
The GameStop stock frenzy
even now has the attention
of the White House.
JEN PSAKI:
...of course,
our economic team, including
Secretary Yellen and others,
are monitoring,
uh, the situation.
You're witnessing the
French Revolution of finance.
There is
a rebellion aspect to it.
There is an antiestablishment
aspect to it.
I-I don't know if
Wall Street's ever seen it
like this before, Cher.
No.
We never have.
It's generational.
It's like, uh, generational
injustices or like...
MAN:
This is like little
poor guys versus rich guys,
and poor guys are
winning right now.
WOMAN:
Fucking hold.
If you're new here
and you're trying
to make a profit, fuck off.
Stop what you're doing
and listen up.
I own GameStop on Robinhood,
and I am not selling.
Hold.
All you need to do is hold.
Keep fucking holding.
["SEVEN NATION ARMY" PLAYING]
Soon the Tendieman comes
to send our rocket to the sun.
See, this right here
is the human being
who's largely responsible
for all this GameStop stuff.
Just a pure specimen.
A godlike,
undefeatable creature.
This is what excellence
looks like.
I just like the stock.
MAN: Yesterday he posted this,
that he's in profit--
wait for it--
47 million.

Hey, did you try
a different browser?
I opened the browser.
Shit, we're fucked.
Bro, what the fuck?
What the fuck, dude?
I told you this shit is rigged.
What the fuck is going on?
I can't get it to load.
[PHONE DINGS]
Fuck!
What?
They shut down WallStreetBets.
CAROLINE:
What?
"Hateful and
discriminatory content."
That stuff has
always been on there.
That's weird.
No?
It's like they're trying
to stop people
from talking to each other.
[PHONE VIBRATING]
Babe, are you gonna get that?
Yes.
Hello?
Uh, yes, I am.
Uh, I am Roaring Kitty
and DeepEffingValue.
Uh, no, but-but, uh,
nobody ever asked me.
Oh. Okay.
Uh, sir, I just want to say
how grateful I am for this job
and how much it means to me
and my family.
I would never let a hobby
jeopardize...
Okay. I understand.
Yeah?
It's MassMutual.
They're getting calls
from reporters
concerned about
my outside activities.
Was all this against the rules?
Uh, it wasn't.
Maybe now it is.
Okay.
Well, what was that call?
Keith?
It's okay.
What, are you gonna
lose your job?
It's fine.
They gave me a choice.
Between what?
Between your job
and Roaring Kitty?
[BABY CRYING OVER MONITOR]
Uh, resign or I'm fired.
That's what he just said?
[CRYING CONTINUES LOUDER]
I got it.
HARMONY [VOICE-OVER]:
Fuck it, WallStreetBets is down.
I can't see Roaring Kitty's
balance sheet.
Oh, fuck.
I don't know what to do.
This could be the sell-off.
I really don't want
to do that.
Well, me neither, but
you can't let it go to zero.
It's 150 grand.
You need that money.
And nobody's gonna hold if
they can't see what he's doing.
Close your eyes
and count to three.

Slow down, Norm.
Wh-What did you say?
The NSCC just sent us a file.
They want a deposit
of three billion
to clear all the trades
coming in.
Sorry.
Wait, who?
They're a subsidiary
of the DTCC,
and they're requesting
three billion.
Uh, okay.
Sorry, it's a little loud
in here.
I thought you just said
three billion.
I did.
But we don't have
three billion, Norm.
That's correct.
We've only ever raised
two billion
in the history of the company.
Holy fuck.
What if we don't pay?
They shut us down.
The IPO?
Like, everything? Poof?
Gretchen, Dan and I are
going to jump on a call

Maybe this would be

Sure. We'll mention that.

Me neither.
I just feel sick.
We'll buy it back

BAIJU: What the fuck did you do?
Calm down.
Me calm down? You shut down
trading on GameStop?
Not all trading.
Norm worked it out.
[BABY CRYING OVER PHONE]
The DTCC agreed
to lower the deposit
to $700 million if we shut off
buying, and that's what I did.
The Depository Trade Commission?

They're like one degree away

[BABY CRYING OVER PHONE]
What?
It's not gonna be okay.
You need to fix this.
Shh, shh. I know. I know.
It's okay.
I did fix it, Baiju.
We've been watching shares
of GameStop all day long.
After hitting
a staggering high of $483,
the shares are now down
to about 140.
Now, the best we can tell is
the Robinhood app,
that seems to have triggered
what really has become
a panic sell-off in this name.
And so if you're a retail
investor or a Reddit user
and you've held,
well, you are feeling
some serious pain right now.
[SIGHS]
Oh, God.
Fuck.
NEWSMAN: Now the criticism
centered on Robinhood for
abandoning their followers here
in favor of helping those
who had shorted
all these stocks
in the first place.
[CROWD CLAMORING]
NEWSWOMAN: I don't particularly
like the move
on Robinhood today.
I'm talking to people this
morning that say...
Hey!
"Okay, that is anti-capitalism.
You can't do that."
Fuck you, Robinhood!
NEWSMAN 2:
There's been some controversy
about Citadel
and some vague accusations
that somehow Citadel
may have been involved
in Robinhood's decision, Wolf,
to stop or restrict trading
in GameStop and other shorts.
YAARA [VOICE-OVER]:
Who is it from?
"The Tendieman."

DAVE PORTNOY [VOICE-OVER]:
We all know how
I feel about him.
I think he's a rat and a liar.
Okay, Vlad, you know everybody
here who's watching us
hates your guts, right?
Thank you, Dave.
That's, uh,
that's what I hear.
Uh, but I'm, uh, I'm
a really big fan of your show,
and hopefully I can answer
some of your questions.
SRIRAM KRISHNAN:
Vlad, uh, can you hear us?
ELON MUSK:
Vlad the Stock Impaler.
Yes, I'm here. Hi.
[LAUGHS]
Spill the beans, man.
What happened last week?
Why couldn't people buy
the GameStop shares?
The people demand an answer.
To give you some background,
I'm chief executive
of Robinhood.
Yeah, we know that.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER]
And I just want to say,
we had no liquidity problem.
Well, did something
maybe shady go down here?
Seems weird that
you'd get a sudden
ten billion dollar demand,
you know...
Three. Three billion.
Okay, thr-three billion
just suddenly out of nowhere,
um, and...
Well, I wouldn't impute any
shadiness to-to any of this.
Um, I don't have
the full context, uh,
as to what was going on
with the NSCC
to-to, uh, make
these calculations.
To what degree are you
beholden to Citadel?
I mean, like, basically,
if Citadel is unhappy,
then what happens?
Is anyone, is anyone
holding you hostage right now?
[CHUCKLES] Uh, n-no.
[LAUGHS]
There's just
no rational explanation
on why they would do
what they did
without outside pressure,
interference.
And they basically cratered
the stock on purpose.
So, I-I just don't believe
anything that guy says.
I wanted to take a cold shower
after seeing him say that.
Robinhood is facing lawsuits.
We know that.
After halting trades,
they are accused
of rigging the market.
When the big guys, including
one of your main investors
in your company,
started to lose,
you shut down the game
to starve the little guy.
They're stealing from the poor
and giving back to the rich!
They're robbing
from the hood!
Why?!
I want to be 100% clear.
All of you guys deserve to go
burn in hell and go to jail.
This decision to restrict trade
was not made...
I'm just trying to get
my mom out of the hood.
...on the direction of Citadel
or any market maker.
What the fuck?
Fuck you!
[SPITS]
And your mama dukes,
you motherfucking...
Fuck this guy.
Ugh. This guy is just
an obfuscating piece of shit.
Fucker.
[SIGHS]
There's only one man
I want to hear from right now.
And WallStreetBets is down,
so it's crickets.
It's crickets out here.
Say it with me.

Hey! To the moon, baby!

Holy shit.
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
We need to talk about
the GameStop situation.
I thought Mecane
was handling it.

So did we.
But the committee specifically
requested you, sir.
If they want specifics,
they can have Mecane.
It's not a choice,
unfortunately.
Shit balls.

Keith?
A congressional subpoena.
I never did anything illegal,

Why would you have disclaimers
if you weren't worried?
[SIGHS]
They're standard practice,
Caroline.
Everyone has them.
Babe.
The answer is not
in your computer.
Whoa.
There's a dozen reporters
on our lawn.
You have to testify
before Congress.
The game has changed.
I know. I hear you.
I don't think you do.
I'll make it work.
And we're gonna go
to my mother's.
[CHUCKLES]
No, she has terrible Wi-Fi.
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about me and her.
You need to figure this out.

Is it free?
It is when you sit up here.
Well, there's a last time

Oh. You'll come back.
I had half a million
in stocks last week,
but Wall Street cheated.
Surprise, surprise.
I could've cashed out.
I could've paid my mortgage.
Could've got my kid braces,
got a new car.

get you something stronger.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

What's this?
Look, they were on sale,
all right,
before you get
all emotional and shit.
Holy shit, you fucking softy.
Who put you up to this?
Caro? Ma?
No, Dad. Called me in tears,
said my big brother needed
some moral support.
Ha ha. Fuck off.
I can't.
Come on, man.
Will you at least
try 'em on, please?
[SIGHS]
Try 'em. Come on, you're
the richest man in Brockton.
You dress like an asshole.
I lost 15 million yesterday
and another 15
the day before that.
You're still the richest man
in Brockton, like, by far.
Bro, you got rich dudes pissing
in their pants right now.
I mean, come on, man.
How many people from
Brockton High can say that?
This has gone crazy.
I got reporters hounding me
outside my house.
Yeah, man, me, too.
They're coming after you.
You didn't talk to them,
did you?
What do I look like? I said no.
I said,
"Give me 50 grand, maybe."
Tell me you're kidding.
Well, if you give me 20,
then maybe we wouldn't
have to deal with this shit.
The fuck
is wrong with you?!
Kevin! I've just been
subpoenaed by Congress, man.
I do not have time
for your bullshit.
Oh, come off it, man!
Seriously, asshole!
Chill!
Fuck!
It was a joke!
[KEITH SIGHS]
[KEITH GROANS]
I know.
Sorry.
[KEITH SIGHS HEAVILY]
We never used to fight
this much.
Sara.
I miss her.
Me, too.
She kept your ego in check.
Whole fucking world
kept my ego in check.
What the fuck are you gonna
tell Congress, Keith? Huh?
Beg them not to send me
to prison?
Hey.
Hey, do you, do you remember
back at Stonehill
when they dared me
to run that mile naked?
Yeah, there was a crazy storm
that night, you dumb shit.
[LAUGHS]
Fuck you, man.
That was dope, man.
I'm a legend over there.
Everybody remembers that.
Okay.
They do, man.
You don't think people remember
your four-minute,
three-second mile?
Oh.
What is this, a pep talk?
Motherfucker, stop hiding.
Seriously. Okay?
Stop being all meek and shit
and running away.
What, you want me
to run through lightning
with my dick out?
Yeah.
Please. Exactly that.
Run through lightning
with your dick out.
Fuck it.
[CROWD CLAMORING]
[VEHICLE DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]
You didn't go
to your mom's?
You took the car.
[SIGHS]
How was the run?
Did it clear your head?
Uh, Kev found me,
brought me these.
Mm. You guys talked?
Yeah.
He, uh, told me to run naked.
You ran naked?
No.
Uh, it's a metaphor.
He's saying I got to
take this thing head-on.
Well...
Kind of like to see you
run naked.
[CROWD EXCLAIMING, SCREAMING]
By the way, uh,
WallStreetBets is back up.
The motherfucker held.
Holy shit.
He lost $30 million,
and he still fucking held.
Robinhood's back up.
What?
We got to get back in.
Where's the stock at right now?
109.
Are you sure?
That's, like, all of the money
that we made
back into the stock.
Yeah. We can't let them
get away with this.
Fuck 'em.

If he's in, I'm in.

Okay.
Fuck!

with retail investors
bidding back up GameStop.
GameStop mania, it is back.
NEWSWOMAN: Up more than 80%,
as those message board traders
simply send it higher.

Stock volatility continuing,
it looks like, this morning.
Once again, GameStop involved
in an ongoing battle
between retail investors
and short sellers.
We're gonna have a lot more
on this story.
NEWSWOMAN 2:
CEOs of Robinhood,
Reddit, Citadel
and Melvin Capital,
along with Keith Gill,
better known as Roaring Kitty
on social media,
will be in the hot seat.
GABE [VOICE-OVER]:
I'm here testifying today
far removed from my background.
I grew up in a middle-class
family in Portland, Maine.
My dad was
a grocery store executive.
LAWYER:
Maybe leave that part out.
The part about my dad?
The executive part.
Okay. Okay.
I went to a public high school.
I studied hard
and got into Northwestern.
Upon...
Just say "a good college."
I can't say
I went to Northwestern?
Too elite.
Northwestern's too...
All right.
Upon graduation,
I did not have a job.
Today, I'm married
with four children.
Gabe, where do you plan on
doing your testimony?
Here.
In front of
your wine collection?
I mean, this is...
I don't have that big
a wine collection, honestly.
Yeah, it's huge.
KEITH:
...digital risks
seemed to be overblown.
Two, the negative sentiment
was overdone.
Three, the value
was overwhelming.
GABE:
Maybe, uh, here would be nice?
Too many windows.
Too many wind-- oh.
It's very bright.
Yeah, oceanfronts,
not a great idea.
It's blue.
Yeah.
Okay, I hadn't thought of that.
That, uh...
Yeah, downstairs
there's more...
There's probably darker rooms.
NEWSWOMAN: What a bandit.
Most of you know this guy
who was
the Roaring Kitty character,
who was really pushing it...
Holy shit.
Yo, Ri, our boy's on the news.
...and was it potentially
a systemic risk?
NEWSMAN:
Those relationships
in D.C. are strong.
The guys who run
those hedge funds
are the guys who fund
presidential campaigns.
That's a good point.
You know, Roaring Kittys don't
have that kind of influence,
but the hedge fund managers do.
NEWSWOMAN 2:
Gill is now being sued
for securities fraud
over his alleged role
in the GameStop rally.
NEWSMAN 2:
Is Mr., uh, Gill
likely to appear,
and if he appears,
is he likely to talk
if he faces, uh,
the potential of prosecution?
The fundamentals are
based on three things.
One, the digital risks
are overblown.
Two, the negative sentiment
is overdone.
And three...
Fuck.
[KEVIN SNICKERS]
Ah, come on. Shut up.
I know all this.
[KEVIN & BRIGGSY LAUGHING]
You guys, you guys, stop!
Stop. Let's keep going.
All right, let's go again.
You're right. This is serious.
You can go to jail forever.
A long time. Long, long time.
All right. Ready?
You ready? Here we go.
Back in the game.
Mr. Gill, Mr. Gill--
May I call you Mr. Gill, sir?
It's my name.
BRIGGSY:
Why the fuck
wouldn't you be able to
call him Mr. Gill?
CAROLINE: What were your
intensions
with the YouTube videos
and your social media posts
on GameStop?
Yes.
KEITH: Thank you, Congresswoman.
CAROLINE: You're welcome.
I developed a theory
that the company
was undervalued
despite the significant
short interests.
Oh, so you were aware
of the short interest?
It is public knowledge.
You can see it
in the SEC filings.
And your goal was
to break these shorts, yes?
To rally an online mob
to artificially push the price
of GameStop soaring, uh,
"to the moon," as they say?
Isn't that correct, Mr. Gill?
Objection, objection!
You're leading the witness.
Kev...
I yield my time to the chair.
You were hoping for the short
squeeze, weren't you, Mr. Gill?
You short-squeezing bastard.
The short squeeze was
a marginal point of the thesis.
BRIGGSY:
Then why'd you talk about it
in your videos all the time?
KEVIN:
You did talk about it
in your videos.
Uh-huh.
You talked about it a lot.
You remember about the squeeze?
Exactly.
You were like,
"It's just a little squeeze."
Exactly.
And you're really asking us
to believe that you weren't
a leader to
all these retail traders?
You're fucked, buddy.
My point of view...
Asking-- Yes or no?
KEVIN: Yes or no? Yes or no?
BRIGGSY: Yes. So yes.
You are admitting it. Yes.
Yes or no?
Remember you-you had
the cheap bottle of champagne?
Kevin! Kevin!
You were dunking tendies
in there like a fucking--
What?
I'm running with my dick out.
Okay, why didn't you
just say that?
Okay. I'll stop. All right.
[HIGH-PITCHED]
Mr. Gill, what exactly
about the fundamentals
led you to build
this bull case?
BRIGGSY:
What the fuck's with the voice?
[NORMAL VOICE]
I don't know. I was trying
to do AOC, but it was flat.
BRIGGSY:
I don't even think
she's on the panel.
KEVIN:
You shut the fuck up, Briggsy.
I'll slap the shit out of you.
Is she on that panel?
I swear to God.
You're gonna slap me?
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.
You ready to go?
KEVIN:
I've been waiting
for this, dawg.
[♪♪♪]
[SIGHS]
Come here.
You're gonna be great.
If it goes bad,
it's gonna be real bad.
Well, don't let it go bad.
MAXINE WATERS [VOICE-OVER]:
This hearing will be the first
in a series of hearings
by the committee
to examine the recent market
volatility involving GameStop.
I want to know how each of
the witnesses here today
contributed to the historic...
Gabe, can you sit up?
WATERS:
...trading events in January.
This recent market volatility
has put a national spotlight
on institutional practices
by Wall Street firms.
And they have demonstrated
the enormous potential power
of social media in our markets.
We will hear firsthand
from the witnesses
regarding these events.
The hearing will be
an opportunity
for this committee
to get the facts
about the role each of
the witnesses represent
played in the events
we are examining today.
JUAN VARGAS:
Well, now, Mr. Griffin,
if I could just
ask you the first question?
Of course.
How many people are
in the room with you?
KEN:
That's your question?
VARGAS:
If you can just count
how many people
are in the room with you.
KEN:
There are five people,
including myself, in this room.
VARGAS:
Did anyone in
your organization...
Prick.
...since January 1st,
contact Robinhood?
We of course talk
to Robinhood routinely
in the ordinary course
of business.
We manage a substantial portion
of their order flow.
But did you talk to them about
restricting or doing anything
to prevent people
from buying GameStop?
I want to be perfectly clear.
We had no role
in Robinhood's decision
to limit trading in GameStop.
Fuck you, Ken Griffin.
VARGAS:
So, if we depose
everyone in your organization,
we will find that?
That is correct.
Looks like
a Disney Channel villain.
AL LAWSON:
Mr. Plotkin, do you
believe that there is, uh,
manipulation, distrust
and overall inequality
within American finance?
My focus is on
my company, Melvin...
[VOLUME MUTED]
KEVIN:
Hello?
You're on mute, dick.
Uh, I'm sorry. You're on mute.
[LAUGHTER]
[VOLUME MUTED]
STUDENT:
He just keeps going.
...my area of expertise.
TAYLOR:
You're still on mute.
I haven't been able to hear
a word you said, unfortunately.
OCASIO-CORTEZ:
Mr. Tenev, would you be
willing to commit today
to voluntarily
pass on the proceeds...
Ah. Marry me.
...of the payment for order flow
to Robinhood customers?
Congresswoman,
I appreciate that question.
When the statement
you refer to was made,
it was before Robinhood
forced the entire industry
to drop commissions
and replicate our...
I should take that as a no.
You're not willing
to pass on the proceeds
of payment for order flow
to your customers?
When the other brokers drop...
I'm just talking about today.
[STUDENTS CLAMORING]
Asshole!
I don't want to be rude.
I just have limited time.
Uh, but if removing
the revenues that you make
from a payment for order flow,
uh, would cause the removal
of free commissions,
doesn't that mean
that trading on Robinhood
isn't actually free
to begin with?
[STUDENTS MURMURING]
HARMONY: Good question.
WATERS:
Thank you very much,
uh, Mr. Gill.
You are now recognized
for five minutes
to present your oral testimony.
[BREATHES DEEPLY]
Thank you,
members of the committee.
I am happy to discuss
my purchase of GameStop shares
and my discussions of their
fair value on social media.
But before I do that,
a few things I am not.
I am not a cat.
[SIGHS]
What did he say?
KEVIN: He just said "cat," Ma.
It's like a,
it's like a Kitty thing.
KEITH:
Nor am I a hedge fund.
I do not have clients,
and I do not provide
personalized investment advice
for fees or commissions.
I grew up in Brockton, Mass.
My family was not wealthy.
My father was a truck driver
and my mom a registered nurse.
KEVIN:
That's you, Ma!
I was one of three kids
and the first in my family
to earn a four-year
college degree when I graduated
from Stonehill College in 2009.
That was not a good time
to be looking for a job.
From 2010 to 2017,
there were significant periods
when I was unemployed.
I took an interest
in the stock market,
and even though
I had very little money,
I used those times
to educate myself
and learn more about investing.
Mr. Gill, I find it
hard to believe
that you predicted everything
that happened to GameStop
with no inside information.
Uh, I didn't predict it.
I honestly couldn't
explain everything
that happened in January.
CONGRESSMAN:
I've seen your videos.
You honestly couldn't recount
to the committee
what caused
every single up and down
of the stock in January?
I think you could.
Um, I did follow the stock,
uh, very closely,
but threshold lists,
order flows,
halting purchases--
according to the press--
these all had
a material impact on the stock.
Here's the thing
I-I have a bit of experience
with this stuff,
and even I barely understand
these matters.
It's alarming
how little we all know
about the inner workings
of the market.
Which is why I'm glad
this committee is examining
what happened,
particularly with
the exorbitant short interest,
as well as any potentially
manipulative shorting practices
and brokers' reported failures
to timely deliver shares
and settle trades.
A lot of people feel
the system is broken.
The whole idea of the
stock market is to be, like,
kind of a fair playing field,
where if you're smart
and maybe with a little luck,
you can make your fortune.
But if it ever was that,
it's certainly not anymore.
The big firms have
such a big advantage
in terms of technology
and information
and just sheer wealth,
there's no hope
for the little guy anymore.
Or there was no hope.
Maybe now there is.
And as for me,
I like the stock.
[CHEERING]
He's gangster for that.
And I don't plan on selling
anytime soon.
MAN: Hold it! Hold it!
Say that shit.
Diamond fucking hand.
Diamond hands, baby.
Attaboy.
What a nerd.
Thank you.
[EXHALING HEAVILY]
It was good.
I think.
NEWSMAN:
Yesterday's Reddit
hearing in Congress
brought together
some of the power players
behind the January
trading frenzy.
NEWSWOMAN:
Representative Maxine Waters
did say that there will be, uh,
additional hearings on this
and there will be
two more to follow
to find more answers...
NEWSMAN 2: Ultimately,
whether it's markets
or social media--
or I'll just call it media,
'cause that's what it is now--
do you think
any new regulation gets done?
NEWSMAN 3:
What's clear is that
we're in the Wild West
and that there is so much
activity that's going on
on these online forums.
And we've seen in the last
month, in the last six weeks,
how much force
day traders en masse
can bring to the market
and actually affect it.
They used to just make
some noise around the edges.
Now they can actually move
markets and move securities.

[MOUSE CLICKS]
[CAMERA BEEPS]

[SIGHS SOFTLY]
[SIGHS]
You're a fucking gangster.
[♪♪♪]
Hey, man, I noticed you've been
selling a lot of new games,
and I just want
to remind you again
that we really want
to be pushing customers
towards the higher margin
pre-owned games.
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
Excuse me?
Oh, and in fact,
I'm not gonna do any of
the "Circle of Life" bullshit
or your TikTok dance contest.
You're quitting, then?
Okay.
Nah, I mean,
I-I thought about it, but...
like, yo, I love it here.
So I think I'm-a stay.
Oh, you're awfully smug
for a kid
who lost all his money
buying stock.
What'd you say it was going to?
A thousand?
I'm also not gonna work
at the ass crack
of dawn anymore.
You're fired!
No, I'm not.
You got to get that approved
by like seven levels
of people, yo.
Thanks to the geniuses
who put that together.
