Dedicated to the batch of 1946 - 1948
of Kottayam CMS College.
Waiﬂ!
You eunuch, You dog!
Beat him!
Beat him...
Kill him!- Suku
Sir, the vehicle to take you
to the airport is here
One more academic year
is coming to an end.
Another batch is stepping out
You are all today's modern kids.
That's very good
Here sitting before me,
you people who will be very busy with
your work and jobs in the IT field
I do not know if you will find the time
to remember your days here
Before you there was a generation
who studies here, and who made
the campus life a celebration
Central
This is a time where lot
of fights are going on.
Father Varghese has
started his speech
Father, come fast!
Which son of God has
remembered the Lord!
Don't fool with the lord!
There is a reason to remember this.
The Chemistry batch, which studied here 14 yrs
back are coming here for a get-together tomorrow.
The son of our teachers, Mr.lyer
and Chemistry HOD Mrs.Laxmi.
Murli was in that batch
The music club will be dedicated in
the memory of Murli who died.
It was his mother's wish that the ceremony be a
small one which included only his classmates
So you all are not invited
A group of ex-students will come back
to remember their dead friend
A number of students have
passed out from here
But after the batch of students,
who will be here tomorrow had left,
I did not sleep for two days
Father, were you so attached to them
Not because of that, it's because they
stole my cot and fan when they left
They were so naughty.
No, we have not called anyone else
Suku!
When I heard you were a diamond
merchant in Bombay,
I was expecting a big fat Man/vari Seth.
You only have a beard.
Must be because of your earlier
communist tendencies.
Where is your wife?
There's no one else to attend to the business,
so she had to stay back.
That's bad.
Don't make me run, wait!
Who's that, is it BBC?
We called her over to meet you all.
Heard you got married in Bombay.
That naughty fellow won't let me enquire
about anyone's well-being
Where's your husband?
Inside.
He never bothers about all this.
You wait
My old room...?
I have kept your old room,118
Suku..
I was missing you a lot from the time,
I came here
The walls and mattresses
have not lost their smells
Still smells of the good old days
If tonight the power goes off,
we will sit together
What's wrong with you?
Did sir enquire about your wife?
- Yes.
Look, we are going to meet
everyone after a long time
You have to forget your personal
problems for sometime
That's what I am trying to do.
When did you arrive?
Ijust came in now.
She's been crying a lot.
- Come, I'll take her
What's the matter?
It's the same thing every-time,
throat infection
ltold him not to come from Dubai now
What does she know about friendship?
She who has studied in Dubai in comfort
I had to force her to come along
I'll just go down the corridor.
- Okay.
Hello! I heard you had arrived.
After a long long time
This is my wife, Liz
I heard you had a bankjob in the
USA and had got married there
All that time you chased Vakkachan's
daughter was wasted
Oh! All the old friends are together
Annamma, you are now the
State Joint Secretary
I heard of your leg fracture in a
grenade explosion in the news
This is Rajashekharan.
He is the Treasurer
Your marriage was celebrated
by the television channel
Isn't that Koshi?
I did not recognize him
You have changed a lot
This is Suku
This fellow has changed from
his earlier un-kept ways
Come tell me about yourself
Brother, I have married her
I am looking after her father's estate
You don't say anything about
my past to embarrass me
Look, this was his earlier state
That rascal has spoiled everything
He was an extra-terrestrial
He never posed for photographs
I'll kill you
This is only a photograph
She will not know about your smelly shirts
Isn't this MLA Satheeshan Nannikuzhi
How's everything, Ouseppetta
What's special about us.
- Praise the Lord!
Always and forever, Praise the Lord!
I've heard about you in the
news-paper and in the news
What are you doing nowadays?
L'm personal assistant to the MLA
You are still his tail
No wonder they called you Vasu the tail
You are a leader...
ls this the time you come?
I'll beat you now
The budget session is on
I wasn't sure I would be able to come
I have a few old issues to settle
That's why I have come
What's the next program?
After this there is a get-together
in the auditorium
Later there is dinner
After that they will all stay happily
for one night at the hostel
They will leave tomorrow morning
Central
Sorry Sir!
I was held up because a
program in Bangalore.
That's all right.
The function is just going to start
When I called, they told me
you had left
I had to meet a couple of people
We really missed you
Don't cry
You are Basi's wife.
- Yes
l'm Tara
Why is your daughter crying?
She's not well
Welcome!
The bishop's meeting got overjust now
I hope I am not late?
- Just a little
Father, this is Satheeshan.
So, all you villains are here
That photograph looks alive
Only now do I feel,
that it's 15 years since we left college
We should take our daughter to
Kanjirapally after the function
Why? What's the matter?
There's a good pediatrician there
We can meet him at 8.00 pm
Who told you this?
Tara Kurup
What happened?
Nothing.
- Tara begged the doctor for an appointment
This is for our daughter's cause
Don't give me any excuses
- Okay we'll go. Now you leave
Why is she so interested in
my daughter's well-being
ls it to see to it that you are alone here,
and take revenge for past events?
The one who has many
awards to her credit
The one who has entertained
many ministers
He's overdoing it
Nowadays praise doesn't come cheap
The daughter of the great Mr. Kurup
is here to address you
Don't make long speech.
It was Murali's wish that we should
meet here after all these years
l'm happy to see everyone once again
Like Vasu said,
today I am a professional dancer
I also run a dance school in Ernakulam
Marriage?
Not yet
ln-spite of your great popularity.
Why didn't you get married?
Tell us. Let's hear you
I was expecting this question
Once you are lost in the path of life,
it's difficult to find the right path again
That's all I've got to say
I didn't get it. It's a puzzle!
Who's that?
Penguin, Penguin...
One of our old girls from college,
Rasiya alias penguin
The one who used to prance
around in the college, is back
When I didn't see you I was worried
We were all sharing our life's experiences,
of the past 14 years
We want you too to join in
We contacted Rasiya with great difficulty
None of us would ask her anything
This is the condition upon which
she has agreed to come
ls that understood?
You go sit there
What's next?
We have got together to re-create
the time you'll studied here
That song you all sang
together as a group
Sing that song now
Let your husbands
wives and kids hear it
Sing it
Central
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...
They'll cool your hearts...
The pretty girls eyes...
Are like the sun coming
through the window blinds...
The surrounding nature will keep you cool...
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...

The love of young hearts are like the shade...
Central
They'll cool your hearts...
To turn the dew drops into glitter...
When the soft sunlight of the
morning sun falls on them...
All that I see will appear like a rainbow...
All that I hear seems like sweet music...
The flowers will dress up in golden robes...
To meet thecool breeze...
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...
Central
Doesn't your heart long to turn into a peahen...
Like a bird not seen but heard...
Don't you wish to be coy and shy
Like the first rain
Drenches the parched earth...
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...
The pretty girls eyes...

What is it, Laxmi?
If Murali was here he too would have
enjoyed with his friends
But we are not lucky enough
to see it happen.
Don't cry. The kids are so happy.
If they see you like this
they too will be sad.
Come, let's keep our
sorrow to ourselves.
Let the good thoughts of the lord be with us.
- Let us be blessed
There lyer sir and Laxmi
teacher are coming
What is it, Father?
- This singing
I can't see clearly at night
So I asked him to come along
I asked him to sing to keep
him from sipping the wine
Haven't you'll left as yet?
We were keeping Murali's
guitar in the parlour
His friends are here
His soul too must be here somewhere
Let it be here today
- That's a good thing
Then we'll meet the kids
before we go.- Okay
Sing! Give it here
Central
It's okay
It must be the mood after meeting
your old friends after a long time
Why are you alone?
There in Satheesan's room,
everyone has gathered
He is treating everyone generously
I was waiting for him.
He was supposed to join me,
He hasn't come back from the doctor
How many pegs have you downed
- Just one or two
I can see, I need not ask you
how the function was.
The function was great. I would be
regretting if I had missed it.
That's all I want to hear
When are you returning?
My flight is at 2.00 pm tomorrow
noon from Nedumbaserry
So you will leave here only
in the morning by 10 am
We will meet before you leave
I want to thank you for
arranging this function
I could never have missed
it for anything
lam the happiest person
in the world today
lt's not right that the happiest man in the
world should also be the fittest, isn't it?
Look's like everyone has gone to sleep
This guy hasn't slept as yet
You go ahead I'll just check on him
Don't be too late.
- No, I won't
He's not dead,
he's in the struggling stage
We will know after 48 hours
Did you inform the police?
- Yes
This guitar's string was
found around his neck
Keep it. We'll need it for
taking the finger prints
This is a baffling case
After they left college, I thought that would be
the end of my troubles with them
That's when they decided to come back.
It's destiny!
You'll look in that box
Let's hope we find something
I can't leave here without a clue
That MLA is waiting downstairs
I have to answer him
That's the tragedy for the men in uniform
One has to pacify the public
Stop the search and seal the room
I've got here whatever's there to get.
- Move out of the way
What happen?
This is his diary
Before he left Bombay
he has made an entry
Let me read it to you
Yes, you read it
I've been thinking of ending this life,
which is of no use to anyone
I've thought of a number of ways
of committing suicide
It's a good thing I did not
attempt it till now
Today lyer sir's phone had come
There will be a journey to my past
l'll think of everything else after that
A month back his wife divorced him
and went off with someone else
In depression...
That too has been written here
Can you show me that diary?
- What for?
I just can't believe that this is
a case of suicide.- Why?
Have you seen anything?
Don'tjust make any wild guesses
Do you have any solid evidence
It's not enough to doubt anyone
If we have to doubt anyone,
there will be quiet a few of them
Including the one who
placed the guitar there
I only said that he was
considering suicide
I did not say that what happened
here was a suicide attempt
To know the truth we will have to
wait till he regains consciousness
Then we can take his statement
Till he regains consciousness
no one can leave here
In case he does not gain consciousness
things will not be too good
Oh, My Lord!
How did you know of it, Father?
Yesterday I awoke from my sleep on
hearing Pious's scream
How did you know it was Pious screaming?
My eyesight is weak at night
Even now I can just manage to see things
only after adjusting my glasses
The Lord has compensated my weak
eyesight with a keen sense of hearing
That's it then
Can you tell me how far I am from you,
by listening to my voice
You are at a distance of4 feet from me
Now you are at a distance of 8 feet from me.
- How can that be?
From Christmas to New Year
there are 7 days
But from New year to Christmas
there are 358 days
It's not just your ears,
even your brain has got the extra power
When you have to control the kids,
it comes handy
Anyway, who's this Pious?
Iam.
When you came back from
the doctor at midnight,
You saw a light in his room.
How can I believe you?
Were you particularly happy
on seeing Sukumaran here?
It's not like that.
I and Sukumaran were best friends
Were there any enemies of his
in the group gathered her
You were his best friend.
You should know
Come along
As I have said,
we have to wait till he gains consciousness.
Until then you all stay here
The forensic experts will give
me their report
Then I'll summon those whom I need
to speak to, to the Police-station
Do you think Suku will consider suicide
only because his wife left him?
I too am confused
I have no idea how all this has happened
I had gone to his room an hour
before this happened
He said he was the happiest
person on earth then
According to the police that
might not be solid evidence
But I am sure he was not thinking
of suicide when I left him
Then it appears that after I went out there
has been some other occurrence in his room
Something, that made him feel like giving up
his life but he was happy man that day
Or else, somebody, after all these years
was nursing a grudge against him
Do you suspect anyone?
You know about Suku's and Tara's
case back in those days
It was Tara who suggested
that I go to the doctor
Then I was suspicious of her motive
May be they wanted me to go,
so that Suku would be alone.
Since Satheeshan came
here yesterday,
there was something suspicious
in the way he was behaving
The solution to this problem elsewhere, not here
The roots of the present
events are in the past
Let there be a Revolution!
Hail the Revolution!
We will liberate Kerala from the clutches
of the traders of education
Palakkad went to the Brahmins
and Kozhikode to the Koyis
We will not let them do the same with education.
- Another strike in college
Down with Kerala government
for turning education into business
Looks like there's a strike today
What's all this?
Instead of screaming yourself horse here,
go to the church and take the Lord's name
There's no use of all that
There have been religions around for so long
Yet look at the state of the world
Before there were religions,
there was water in this world
Yet look at your self, Dirty fellow
I never said anything like that
Shali and Meera, you two come with me,
let's have some tea
Deepa, what are your plans,
now that today is a strike day
What plan?
I have a jeep, We could go out together
have an ice-cream
Go for a movie
If you want we could go away
somewhere all by ourselves.- You...
It is our prime minister's wish
that for the sake of a new generation
Don't you have mother and sisters at home?
Let there be a revolution!
- Stop!
My dear students, to stop education
from being the monopoly of a select few
SFK is organising a students picket today
We would like you all to co-operate with us
All of you go out, leave here
Central
Where are you going, Sir?
- There is a strike on
But what if we want to study
Tara, you don't get smart
lf the whole college is co-operating,
only my class will be left here
We are not going to be threatened
by a few leaders like you
We are here to study
Don't act smart
lfl get angry, I'll...
Don't do anything to her
There may be a lot of people who will be
overcome by your antics and obey
lam not one of them
Tara, don't fight, let's not make trouble.
- Move aside
What's the problem?
Who is not letting Tara study?
What's your concern in all this?
- What's my concern?
Why, lwill be concerned
If it is regarding the daughter of our
great party leader, Mr.Kurup
Look Satheeshan, there is
no issue of any party here
This is our final year and
we want to study
Tomorrow if you take out a strike,
we will still not leave the class
But why should we do that?
Our party is ruling here now
You don't worry Tara
Like the USA was there with
Kuwait when Iraq attacked it
I too will be there for you always
We know what your intentions are
Don't dare say anything
about the MLA's daughter
What will you do if we did?
If you dare then kick
this fellow on his chest
What's he saying?
- Kick him
They and their MLA
- What are you'll doing?
Have you forgotten that we are classmates?
You come with me.
You too are in this with them
Don't forget your house
is near the hostel
I was only looking for my book.
- These people are going to study
We'll see how Pious, you ring the bell
Save me...They are after me.
- Catch him. There... ring the bell
For a long time now that
Tara has been troubling us.
We need to give her a shock treatment
You deserved it
When I was trying to woo that
girl in her group, Meena
If you had not interfered then, today you
would have had one girl less in that group
I still have my chances with Meera
Unless you interfere by saying
that she is our classmate
You don't have to go to so
much trouble for me
That's what friendship is all about
May I talk to Meena...
If you dare go near her again
I'll break your hands
I will always love you...
Forever and ever...
I will remember you always and forever...
Like the night to the day...
I ask leave of you...
Now I am a saint
What's all this?
ls there a music concert here?
Hey, What is the matter with you?
Next week, our friend Sushma
is getting married
So, what's your problem with that?
Were you in love with her?
I don't know if she knew of it
But I was in love with her
for the past two years
If anyone is heartbroken
I end up with a hoarse throat
He made me sing “Sanyasini“
at-least 8 times
I shall go now.
Father is waiting for me
Are you two coming home
to have food
At then listen to all that Sir says
in the morning with his caustic tongue
Ousapettan's dry chappatis
are any-day better
So, I'll tell that to my father
- Don't do that
If we have any issues with the management
only lyer sir speaks up for us
You don't ruin that
- Let me see
Hey you better come with us
Else like you lost Sushma you
will miss todays food as well
Oh mother, who gave birth
to twelve children...
lam the mad one...
Oh mother who has
12 zodiac signs with her...
lam the one who rules...
Why is your face so swollen?
Is it because of what Tara did?
Lazar, you keep quiet, unless you want
Kanzikuzhi to know what goes on here
He has been sent here to keep an eye
on things here, so you have come!
Have you all come?
What is it?
The best chickpeas curry anywhere
Really, or is it chickpeas
in a chilly gravy
Here, you stop singing or I will
throw this tangy curry at you.
You sing something sensible
to a common man
Then I will sing sensibly
The man who serves us is a pest
The father who is with him
is an angry man...
The man who serves us
is a pest...
The Father who is with him
is an angry man...
What's all this noise?
Is this a market-place?
We are practicing to sing for
tomorrow's freshers party
Don't be too smart, Vasu
I heard your song.
Iwill tell one thing
Even though I can't see well at night
I can hear very well
Isn't it a wrong thing to believe everything
that you can hear, but you can't see
My dear Vasu Sadashiva,
You are the son of Sadashiva,
ls what your mother said
You heard it and believed it, didn't you?
You can sleep when you have finished.
It's already late
So it is chick-peas, is it?
A friend's song, I composed it without
his permission I'll sing it now
Central
O moon of my heart!
You're a great singer...
lam waiting for you...
wearing my ornaments...
Need perfume?
No need of perfume...My friend...
Sulthan's best friend...
Come on
We'll go separately in
Rasiya, look where you go
Sister when you came by I could
smell some nice mutton biryani
You must call us over sometime
to have some
Then you try going there
Her father will make mutton chops of you.
- ls that true? Then let's go
After Murali's song, Tara Kurup will perform
her dance.- l'll come back soon
Be careful.
- You go ahead
I want to be the sugar
in your sweet smile...
I'll be the beats of your hearts...
When you go to your wedding...
I want to see your henna hands...
So many hopes and wishes
I have inside my heart...
Central
What do you want here?
- Hello everyone
Hello friends, Blessings father
I'll sit here
I wish I am those strings the
guitar you use...
lam so near to you.
Why haven't you touched me yet?
Hums a lullaby...
Claps and sings a song...
How many times my anklets tried
to join the rhythm with you?
Central
There's an important announcement
A couple, no three of our highly placed political
leaders have come backstage to meet Satheesan
So if he is present in the audience he should
come to the green room immediately
Now we are presenting the dance
performance of Tara Kurup
Take the stage
Central
Tara whatever happened has happened
They will apologize to you
No, sir. This is not going to be
solved just by an apology
I was saying.
- But who is going to apologize
Heard that. Now your role in this is over
Now I'll do what has to be done
Tara, don't go.
Move a side.
You needn't worry,
we are all with you in this.
These fellows think they can do
what they want with their
Political contacts,
l'll handle it from here
Tara wait. Don't go.
- No teacher I am not waiting
At-least hear what I have to say
l'm speaking from experience
You'll take even the smallest
things seriously
These are just pranks
These are incidents you can remember
and laugh about once,
You'll get married and have a family
Laxmi, they have come to
me with the problem
lam the head of the chemistry department
and you are only a lecturer
Why are you giving them advice?
So, what I am saying is that these
problems that appear so big now,
Are meant for remembering
later for a good laugh
You take it in that sense
Already these guys have played enough
pranks on me to remember and
Laugh at for a whole life-time
Let me also give them something
to remember later
Tara, please come back.
- Listen to me...
You don't worry sir.
Tara has a short temper
I'll talk to her and pacify her
You come
What all did you say about Satheeshan?
That he is a snitch,
he is a creator of troubles etc..
Now look how he has come
fonlvard to help you
Who could it be?
Who is it?
Who is it?
What do you want?
Koshi come fast.
Beat them up. Hit them
Catch them!!!
Isn't that Bhaskaran who is crying?
- Why should he?
It must be that Suku beating him up
There's nothing good in Suku's beatings
What's going on here?
Oh! He has beaten the father!
Why do you bother, so long as
it is not your father
Who beat the Father?
It was me.
- Why did you beat him?
It was stupid of me to ask,
you go beat
I invited trouble myself
What did you say about Bhaskaran?
A goon
Goon? My foot!
You get into trouble with a lot of people
Which one of those has sought
revenge on you?
I don't know
Do you suspect anyone?
- No, sir.
How come you don't know?
Your's was the first room they entered
And Newton say's that there is
no reaction without action.
You be brave and tell us.
- You need not be so troubled, sir
Everyone here knows it must be
Satheeshan and Tara
Do you have any evidence?
There can be none
Because one is the daughter
of the current MLA
The other is the young leader
who aspires to be an MLA someday
Why bother about a meeting
on this issue, Father
Nothing's going to come of it
Wait...Are you going to
make trouble again?
If we have got with interest and
principal what we gave them,
Then we know to return it with
double the interest
Come...
Didn't you hear what he said?
The snakes have their self respect.
Only they have no feet to stand on.
Have you'll joined the mathematics class now?
There are signs of “plus“ and
“minus“ on your face
Anyway all the calculations
have worked out fine
Won't you answer the girls?
Casanova Pious, tell him something
You know of all that happened
at the hostel that day.
Venu told me every thing.
I came to meet you...
Rasiya, take off that cover from your face
and look where you are going
Now they will say we harmed you and
come at beat us in the hostel
Why are you getting angry with penguin?
You can't trust any of them
Suku, did they beat you a lot yesterday?
I did not count the number of beatings.
Next time I'll keep a count and tell you
Bindu Balaendra no wonder
they call you BBC
I was just inquiring about his well-being.
- Very nice way of doing that
I was there yesterday at the hostel
I'll tell you the details
You take care.
- You go ahead
Comrade I need your help
Tara, you have come
Ramani, get Tara's milk
Central
This brother of mine is not financially well of
It is for his son that I am asking this job
I have spoken to father
Anyway, when he calls to-night
I shall remind him once more
MohanlaPs performance
was great in Bharatham
So what, even Mammooty gave
a great performance in Amaram
All you Mammooty and
Mohanlal fans go out
lam feeling very sleepy, it must be
because we went out in the evening
Anyway you can't keep your eyes
open once it's 9 o'clock
Hey you 9°---
Upstairs... third room.
Hey, what are you doing?
Iam kissing the stairs where
so many girls have walked
Like that one of my dreams
has come true
She looks so beautiful
You just go and lift the bed
She is so heavy, after-all she is
the daughter of an MLA
What is all this girl?
Beware! MLA's daughter!
Touch her and get beaten up by goons.
How can you say that it
was me who did it?
Is there any evidence?
The last time you overlooked
Tara and Satheeshan's role
Similarly you overlook this one too
But...
Don't worry Father,
l'm here on the campus
Anytime you feel like questioning me,
l'll come
It is not the number of flags or placards
It is our enthusiasm and
belief in our cause
which should be seen tomorrow
in front of the Collector's office
I have only heard that in earlier times
the student would stay at the
Teacher's house to study
But when I saw a student of my class
do the same I was touched
I was going to come and
congratulate you personally
You don't bother,
I have come to you myself
What did you tell the principal?
There is no evidence
You have not tasted the third degree
treatment of the Kerala police
Else they would have got all the
evidence they needed.- No..
I have not spoken of this
to my father
The college principal and the matron
cried and begged of me not to
Go to the police and ruin
the college's reputation
Don't think you have won,
your smile will not last for long
This is my promise
You must thank me
Till the first student came to college,
I stood guard while you
slept your beauty sleep
You must loose weight.
You were so heavy
And you snored so loudly
that I could not sleep
Until nowl had not heard
a girl snore so loudly
Yesterday when we came to
your room you were so fast asleep
These boys were going mad
It was I who covered you to
stop their roving eyes
I can't blame the boys
Even I was having a tough time
keeping myself back as you slept
If you tell your father,
he will inform the police
They will bring along the
newspaper guys
Then they will force me to
give them all the details
So be careful
I'll get you
Long live the revolution!!!
Do away with the powerful lobby
What are you doing in the campus?
You don't go there, Anjali.
- Get lost.
The police are coming
Now you know who Satheeshan is?
- You are a genius
Don't you know who I am?
- You maybe anyone
Tara come, let's go
Don't go there, Police is there,
This is the benefit of having a
library in the college
Inhaler
Don't you know that you are
an asthmatic?
Then why did you not get
along the inhaler?
Don't shout. He's okay.
- Aren't you okay?
He's okay, aren't you okay?
Why are you doing this?
You can't come here and beat up
our children like this
They threw stones at the police.
We are only looking for their leader
That is between you and their leaders
Why do you have to beat up
all the children for that?
Aren't there any educated policemen?
It started with asking what's a
lecturer is doing in college.
You go away now
Devasi, you lock up the
class rooms now.- Okay
Why did you save me from the police?
You happen to be my class mate
ls that the only reason
Then you should keep the whole
class photograph in your purse
Notjust mine, it was lying there.
I got it from there
Five years back at a school
competition I saw this girl
who had won all the prizes
in the dance competition
I fell for that round eyed girl
I would see her image in my books
I imagined the songs on the
radio were about her
I promised myself that I would join
the same college as her
Which I did, but when I came close
to you I saw a very proud girl
I thought it best not to get close to you.
You made reasons for me to hate you
All day long I hated her but at night her
eyes reminded him of his love for her
At that contest I too had noticed that young man
who had won awards In the debates
She hoped he would join her college
She was happy, when she
saw him in her class
But she was angry that he
was friends with everyone else
All day long she hated him
but at night
She slept with a pillow on
which his name was written
But the young man is more realistic
He wants to know if, after
the course he gets a job,
Will she come along with
him when he calls her
What if she comes?
If she comes...
You're the girl who sang the
songs of Lord Rama...
You're the girl who sang the
songs of Lord Rama...
You are the girl I was waiting for...
This is the moment I was waiting for...
You are the girl I was waiting for...
This is the moment I was waiting for...
You are like the honey in the flower...
You are the dawn in my life...
The bird who brought the dawn...
The love in our hearts are like a flame...
Central
Isn't it a long time?
Let's forget our anger...
Let me hold your hand...
My heart is like a caged bird...
You let it be free...
Oh, beautiful Radha...
Are you waiting for Krishna to come...
To hear his flute...
To see his lips play a song on it...
You are the girl I was waiting for...
This is the moment I was waiting for...
Central
When I see you there is a feeling
of calmness in me...
In the moonlight... lam in a dream
land Where we are together...
The time hasn't come yet...
It's time to come together...
To love and sing in the beauty of it...
Central
My God! Father!
How-ever much they tried to keep it a secret,
their love became the talk of the college
It was not possible for them speak
to each other in peace
That's when, in the month of January the students
camp was organized in Tiruvanathpuram
They decided to go for it
Suku took his and Tara's certificates with him
to Tiruvananthapuram to apply for the camp
I went to my Mother's house on my way
back from Tiruvananthapuram
I left Tara's certificates
there my mistake
I'll go after the election
and get it back
What have you got to do with
this Tamil girl on the Radio
Don't tell me you have fallen
for a Tamil girl
No, I have not gone to
that level as yet
How can I ?
For my guy with the newly
formed moustache
What's wrong with you?
Did any girl hit you on your head?
I don't know what to write, or how to write it
My mind feels like a lost child.
Where did you get that letter from?
What did you say earlier?
One should not get involved with
girls from one's own class.
You loved a girl from your own class
Not just that you spent
a night with her too
You told me lies that there nothing happened
between the two of you that night
You can make your
confessions in church
But you should not have betrayed a friend
like me one who is so close to you
Give me that letter
Not until you tell me the truth
But there is nothing in that letter
I have yet to read the last part,
then I'll know
I can feel your touch, like flowers,
I was thinking of you
Why should she think
of you like that?
That's because we sat close
to each other that day
There's nothing to it.
It's not what you are trying
to make of it
Just when I was getting to
the interesting part..
You'll stop making noise
Else that old man will come here
and we'll all land in trouble
Since he cannot see much at night,
the power-cut will not trouble him
I habitually made noise
after a power failure.
Then he'll make your first night,
into your last night
Pour some water.
- Don't dilute it further
You are spoiling them
- It's they who are spoiled.
I was just keeping an eye on them
What a great social work!
Didn't you see the power go off.
Go and start the generator
But the generator is leaking
You go and put it on, else these
fellows will make a lot of noise
Go fast before they start calling me names
lam sure this cat calling voice will
take him to parliament.
Father Vadivellu, put on the light
Lights on! Brother give me that letter,
I'll give it to Bindu tomorrow
What a language
I don't trust you with this letter
It's the language used here which
will give you wrong ideas
It's not your fault but this letter's.
So, let the letter be safe in my diary
And let it hatch more baby letters
You get lost
As party leader, what do you want me to
do to help you win the college election
This year the SFK party workers are very strong
After the strike even the pre-degree
students are with them
Last time we had won the election,
without opposition
If we don't play our cards well,
this time we may lose elections.
I see only one way out
We must make our MLA's daughter
our candidate for the election
ls she the girl who dances?
Yes. If Tara stands for elections
we are sure to win
I'll talkto Mr.Kurup
That's not enough
The party must pressurize him to agree.
- I'll see to that
You go ahead and start campaigning
- I'll take leave.
What do you think of me?
If Mr. Kurup is an MLA,
l'm a better MLA than him. - You mean?
What is the meaning of MLA?
- Member of legislative assembly
That is one meaning
The other one is A man
who woos his daughter
What do you think of me?
If I get close to Tara,
I can get close to her father
Then I can step over these powerful
office-bearers and become a minister
That's why I have kept Tara in my
group for the last 5 years
That Sukumaran thinks he can get her from me
If Tara contests this election,
they are sure to separate
After that I can enter her life
No, I will not allow that
Our closeness is no longer a secret
If you become DSU's candidate then
I will not have any honor as a man
You understand my problem
My father is under a lot of pressure from the party
So what? You are only his daughter
You can flatly refuse to contest
I have given him all the excuses I can think of
There's only one thing left to say
That I love a man from SFK
Then all the problems will be solved
lfl am not studying here, how can I contest
It has become a nasty trap.
You don't have to get all worked up about this
We did not fall in love on the basis of our
family background or the color of our flags
Nothing can come between us now
The election will go by
We will continue to be ourselves
I can understand all this.
But the party won't
Did you take your party's permission
before falling in love
No, but they will not like it if
you contest for the DSU
0k, I'll not contest the election
But, remember you said you will take me
with you when the course gets over
We will have to pre-pone that a bit
We will get married now
A register marriage. We'll work part-time and live
Then I will have to listen only to you
Othenlvise, ifl am staying with my father,
I'll have to obey him
You don't take advantage of my helplessness
You want to contest As a DSU candidate.
Go ahead
Contest for any post, as art club secretary
or general secretary
But remember one thing, no matter
who else wins from DSU, you won't
I'll do everything I can to make you loose
Now it's interval,
next comes election jamboree
These are SFK“s nominations
See that you fight the elections peacefully
- Okay, Father
Central
Don't get sun tanned for the elections.
Let's not delay with the canvassing
This time we decided to start the
canvassing with your song
That won't do - Just come along
We've come for the election campaign
We are launching our campaign
for SFK's candidate
We will start the campaign with a song
by our college singer Murali
Comrades, salute the red flag..."
The strugglers, the workers give the red salute...
Get all our students organized
Your blood has turned the flag red
which I'm holding now...
We are canvassing for the DSU candidate
We request you to give us your vote and
make us win by a 100% majority
To start with here is a song by Murali...sing.
To get our rights, here we come DSU, DSU...
RED Salute! RED Salute!....
Hey you, wait
Central
Your vote, it's the most important thing now...
This note is the one written with an indelible ink
Don't waste it Amini...
Gift it to us dear sister...
The young students of today...
Hands full of blood...
Stand up for a good cause...
Give your vote for a good candidate...
Give a vote for this country...
Central
Don't give your vote to someone
who fights and quarrels...
Don't give your vote to that smiling
good for nothing...
Vote for peace not fights...
A poor man can get it...
if he has self-respect...
No votes for boozers...
No votes for the losers...
No votes for the cheaters...
No votes for the corrupted party.
No votes for the party
that supports violence.
Don't vote for this eunuch...
See how all the votes go to us...
There are no votes for the ruling party...
There are no votes for the party
that will dictate rules...
There are no votes for the party
that will dictate rules...
Central
Have you forgotten the beating we got
last time we tore a poster...
You come along...
Give me that gum
What are you doing? That is our poster. - I know
No one will believe I did this
even if you say it
What is it?
Baby Jack-fruit
If our dear Tara is so addressed no one
in the college will vote for SFK
This time we are going
to sweep the elections.
You go and stick these on the other posters
Be careful and stick it
What is this a jack-fruit!
Sister Tara, this is apt description for you
Does this Jack-fruit have salt?
- Taste it to know.
This must be Suku's work.
Only he can be so mean
It's very nice of you
It wasn't me Tara!
SalutationsH
Your vote is for me, isn't it?
This is Mathavan's brother-in-law
Of course I know him
You'll vote for us, won't you?
Sister your vote is for us
What a shame!
We are not the sort to insult
our own college-mates
If we win you can study in peace
Remember that and cast your vote
lf you get all the votes, we will have to
cover our heads in shame, leader
Come with me
Come
Leave me, don't touch me!
- Don't move.
I have a cycle chain tied to my waist
I will wring your neck with it
Leave me! Your hand hurts!
Who did this? - What?
Who did this?
How do I know? Wonder which wretched fellow
did this to our candidates poster
I know that such an idea will only occur
to a wretch like you
Am I a wretch?
Why are you fighting?
I have to keep an eye on him till
the election gets over
Did you know?
Rasiya is waiting with her father at the office
to get her transfer certificate
You'll go and vote, instead of fighting here
What happened to Rasiya?
BBC you go and tell everyone the news
It's not for the vote, but to separate me
and Tara that you did this
She is my girl
She was ready to run away with me
to avoid being your candidate
Your attempts are all in vain
All this anger will dissolve once
the election is over
After that we will not be able to
stay away from each other
That is the chemistry of love
Idiots like you won't under-stand that
What? Your dream that they will not
come together has been shattered.
After the elections he will take her and go.
All our efforts will be in vain
That's why I asked you to steal the letter
that Tara wrote to Suku
It is his efforts that will go in vain
He is going to do that deed of miss - trust
that no person in love will do
And Tara will never again trust him after that
What are you going to do?
This letter that Tara wrote to Suku
will burst like a bomb
When the election results are counted
it will burst like a love-bomb
How? - Come I'll show you
She is depressed
Why? ls it because of that poster they stuck?
Do you think we have been
silent for insulting you?
Anyway, it has turned out to be good for us
The pre-degree students and all
the girls are voting for us
I've provoked Soman against them.
After the elections are over there will be a fight
between our supporters and theirs
You go home
I'll go home
You call me up and tell me the results
Central
Why are you so late?
We were busy campaigning
See who is here
What is it?
Don't create a scene here, please
and don't spoil my goods.
What is this? A college, or a fighting ring?
Father! Goons have descended
on our college.
What are we to do now?
Call the police or else this place will become
a ground full of dead bodies
There is an announcement
Because of the fighting , the counting of votes
has been post - poned till tomorrow
Till the counting of votes is over,
the police will be here
All students are requested to
leave the campus
Tomorrow when the votes are counted
the letter will be out
Today morning's poster incident
was not a big issue but this is a big issue.
That letter was written with the belief
that only I would read it
lf she thinks that for political gains I used it,
that will be the end of everything between us
I am going mad
What is the use of getting mad here?
Call her up and speak to her
tried to, but couldn't get through
Anyway, in a situation like this,
she will never believe me
You know how she behaved when I went to
tell her about the poster incident
I thought I would explain everything
to her after the election
But this Kanikuzhi fellow has spoiled everything
Only if that letter gets out will there be a problem
What if it doesn't?
H 0W?
The ballot boxes are in the principal's office
The keys to the office must be there close-by
But how do we get in?
The college is full of policemen
The principal's office too must have a sentry.
There's a way
I had stolen some chloroform from
the chemistry lab once
It's raining heavily
That 316 batch no. must be getting tired
After Mr. lyer's round, you go send him back
Central
Close the bottle
Get the key
Got the key - Come lets go
It must be in this room
Be careful, don't break it.
Our class had the box no 76
You look for it while I locate the Keys
Run, You go that way
These guys don't sleep
Go and tell Sukumaran there's a call for him
What are you doing?
Looking for your chain with the cross,
like you asked me to
Why didn't you start the generator?
I can't. The generator is leaking badly
Didn't you get an electrician to repair it?
I did, but the generator is so old,
nothing much can be done
You start the generator
Else they'll finish the fight they
started in the morning
The police said some fellows had entered the campus.
- And what?
You go start the generator
What a noisy students!
Who said hell is there, it's here
Who is it?
It's me, there's a call for me
It's me!
Where are you calling from?
- From a telephone booth.
Just called to check if you've
reached the hostel.
You don't come here now.
The police are here
You sleep at one of our friends house
and come in the morning
okay
During the vote-counting Tara's
letter was exposed
The teachers and student-representatives
there saw it
Everyone believed that it was Suku's handiwork.
Including Tara
With that Suku lost his Mental balance,
he went berserk
Bloody eunuch!
Kill him!
Murali is lying dead in the generator
room at the hostel
How can I bear it?
Central
See your friends have come
Won't you open your eyes and look at them
The principal is here
What happened?
Murali comes to the hostel often.
It was raining and he must have taken
shelter in the generator room.
I was fearing the trouble in college
would reach hostel too.
The generator was leaking,
yet I started it
He was an asthmatic. There is no ventilation
in the generator room.
The post-mortem report says death was due
to inhaling poisonous gases
When you went to start the generator
didn't you see him
It was dark inside and there was no sound
He must have fallen asleep
I saw him when I went to put off the
generator in the morning
You said you would give him the best student
award before he passed out of college
This happened too early
He liked his college and hostel a lot
He would say he never wanted to come
back from college
So he went...
So he went...
The seasons will change...
The trees will bloom, the fruits will mature...
With every season there are
so many changes
We will also change with time
We should meet sometime in the future
At that time a few may be successful
A few may be struggling
So the ones who are successful can help
the ones who are struggling
We can help each other
And all the serious things that we do today
can be laughed at then
Tomorrow the college will re-open
Murali will not be there
Nor will Tara her parents may not
send her here again
The days will seem like a burden from now on
lam going to discontinue my studies now
What are you saying?
You know I came to this college for Tara
I can't stay here after the way she was insulted
I will speak to Tara
She will not understand
The truth is that she has gone
At home my mother is also getting old
I need to look for a job to take care of them
With this state of mind I can't
study and give exams
Are you serious?
Yes, I need a change
A man called Hameed from my
village is in Bombay
I'll approach him for a job
As Murali said if destiny permits we
will meet in the future
Hameed was a diamond merchant
He introduced Suku to a man called Shantaram
Suku became his trusted man
He helped Suku to get his mother
treated for her illness
He helped him to get his sisters married
He had his reasons
He got his daughter Ratna, who was involved with
an undenlvorld don, to marry Suku
They pretended to live together in one house
till Shantaram was alive
After his death she got a divorce and
went off with her lover
Did he meet Tara after leaving college
No, he saw her here after all these years
She seemed to have some motive for coming here
No sir, I came only because you called
Then why did you end Pious and his
family to the doctor that day
The doctor said you insisted on an
appointment that same night
What was your intention?
That night you met him
What happened after that is
what I want to know
I'll tell you
I send Pious off so I could get Suku alone
I wanted to apologise for past mistakes
After leaving college ljoined a
dance institute in madras
I needed my certificates for that
They were with Suku
I had contact only with Satheeshan
He took me to Suku's house
I was shocked when I saw his house
ls it Suku's house?
- Yes. Please come in.
Come inside
We are Suku's classmates
I have seen your Photographs
- Who is it?
They are Suku's classmates
What do you want
My dance certificated are with Suku
I have come to get them
All his things are in this box
You can look for it here
Central
I got my certificates
We will leave now
You should have some tea
- No thanks.
How is Suku in Bombay?
He is struggling there
What else you want to know?
How won't he
I worked for other people to earn money
to send him to college
We starved but we sent him money to study
But of what use?
He wasted it all, and did not
appear for his exams too
Mother!
- You keep quiet.
He got the degree and a job only to
ditch a family that depended on him.
These kids work here and send
money to him in Bombay
Whatjob will he get without a degree?
Good for nothing son.
He will never do well
He will never do well
He not only cheated me but also his family
Bloody cheat! I was lucky to free
myself from his clutches.
How could he not see his mother's tears?
Didn't you hear what his mother said?
Iam saved from being with such a man
Where will he take all those curses
from his mother
That mother's curses did not fall on him
They fell on me
I was the reason he left college
I put that letter in the ballot box
It took me some time to recover from that shock
The next time I came from Madras I went
to his house once more
He had taken his mother and sisters to Bombay
My first dance program was in the
Shanmukananda Hall in Bombay
The man who arranged that program
was Suku's boss's friend
I got to know of Suku's marriage from him
lwasn't hurt
I knew he had agreed to it to save his family
Then Mani Nair became my program co-ordinator
for my North-Indian programs
I came to know of his divorce
lfl had believed him then, he would not
have had to suffer so much
I came to apologize to him
These are non-vegetarian dishes
It's me Tara
Don't be afraid
I haven't called to trouble you
I want to speak to you
Can you come behind the generator room
It took you 15 years to recognize my love
To understand me
I don't blame you
It must be destiny
Fate played hell with me.
First he gave me life in the form of Tara Kurup,
Then he gave me Shantaram
Then a pretend wife in Ratna Shantaram
I don't think any apologies
will change our lives now
It must be true
There has been no change in my life
too for many years now
It the same people, the same concerts
I have come to terms with this unchangeable life
We have come to the cross-roads once again
We had dreamt of many things
Can't we bring them to reality any longer?
Can't the round-eyed girl and her man with the
new-grown mustache come together?
After all that why did Suku think of suicide,
beats me
I had to tell lyer sir that we had met
But I did not tell him what happened after that
I think there was someone else there
besides the two of them
How can you say so?
There weren't just two people there.
Then?
That day at the party, some curry fell on me
So I came back to change my clothes
When I was inside I heard the two of them
After they left I heard a third person run out
It must have been a female
I heard the sound of a cross
The sound of a cross?
Who was it?
He escaped without answering me.
I cannot see clearly at night
It was someone who was aware of this
Will you recognize that sound again
Central
Houseppu has told me that at night
he has seen you on the terrace
I was waiting for you
You were like this earlier too
Either reading a book or alone
someplace like this
This loneliness is good
A nice breeze, the moonlight,
it's all here on the terrace
But what good is there near a
generator room at night
Why are you worried?
Why did you go near the generator room at
night on the day of the function
Just like that!
Then why did you run away on seeing father?
I did not want anyone to see me there
Why?
Did you think that your eavesdropping on
Tara and Suku's talk would get out?
I was always doubtful of you
but could not place it
While studying in college too
you had some problem
I did not know why you took
a TC and left college
Now I think I do
It has something to do with Tara and Suku's
love for each other
I am the teacher who knows
everything about you'll
Tell me everything
You don't know anything
You only knew to teach students, to love them
nothing more than that
You did not know your son well too
Notjust you, nobody knew anything
This veil covered notjust my body
but my life too
There was only one person who saw
I had a heart inside me
It was your son murali
I never knew when I started
getting attracted to him.
It was the time the strike took place
My dear fellow students...
Like a poet giving finishing
touches to his poem.
They had come to ask us to leave the room
Come on.
What's the problem here?
Who is troubling Tara?
What's happening here?
- You mind your own business
What are you doing here?
Aren't they your classmates?
You come, we'll go out
You too are in this with them
Don't forget you stay near the hostel
I was looking for a book
- She and her book
lam singing this song without
that person's permission
O moon of my heart!
You're a great singer...
lam waiting for you...
wearing my ornaments...
No need of perfume...My friend...
Sulthan's best friend...
Central
We both will go our separate ways
Rasiya, look where you go
I can smell nice mutton biryani
when you come close by
Call us some time for dinner
I want to be the sugar
in your sweet smile...
I'll be the beats of your hearts...
When you go to your wedding...
I want to see your henna hands...
So many hopes and wishes
I have inside my heart...
O moon of my heart!
You're a great singer...
lam waiting for you...
wearing my ornaments...
No need of perfume...My friend...
Sulthan's best friend...
Central
I wish I am those strings the
guitar you use...
lam so near to you.
Why haven't you touched me yet?
Hums a lullaby...
Claps and sings a song...
How many times my anklets tried
to join the rhythm with you?
Central
What's it father?
What is this?
That...- What is it?
It was just...
Elections are going on
Both of them are strong parties
Hope the election gets over
without any problems
I'll call you later
I want her TC
Isn't she studying for the final year?
Why do you want her TC now
lam her father, and can decide
when I want her TC
I respect you so don't make me say things
Give it in the office.
I want her TC
Do you have any library dues
I have to return a book
- Get a no due certificate.
Why are you taking the TC?
Rasiya you remember to vote
for the SFK's vice-chairman
You go Give the book
My father has discovered our relationship
He is sending me to Hyderabad
We may never meet again
lam writing this letter in the hope that
someone will inform you about my Tc
I hope you will come to the library
and see this letter
Tonight I will come near the generator
room of the hostel
You come there and take me to
the world of our dreams
Suku, did you know, Rasiya has come to get
her TC with her father in the office
You go ahead and cast your vote
Got it?- Yes.
Central
It was raining, so I waited in the shade
I consoled myself saying he must have waited
till his parents went to sleep
But when he didn't come till morning I thought
that he had cheated me
I did not know he was lying all night near me,
dead!
Father, Our Murali!!!
After that I was in a state of shock
I was treated in the hospital,
but never recovered completely
Because of the incident,
my father lost his honour
He shifted to Mangalapuram
He worried a lot about me
Finally he died with all his burdens killing him
Thinking lwas mad none of
my relatives took me in
I lived alone for years in that big house
When someone called me to invite
me for this function I was happy
I thought I could come back and re-live the memories
of the places murali had been in
But, when I saw everyone happy, my loss
seemed all the more greater
My heart cried for the happiness
I would never have
When Suku and Tara were overcoming
their differencel was thinking of my lost love
That's when...
Earlier we split over some mis-understandings
Now there should be no secrets between us
I want to leave aside all my burdens,
and love you with a peaceful mind
That night when I went to get back your letter
You go the police are here
I thought of making unconscious with chloroform
I expected him to be one of Satheesans goons
It was only the next morning that
I knew it was Murali
You are free to make any decision
You can hate me.
Or take back what you've offered.
Inform everyone
Tara could forgive him
But it was me who could not forgive him
For the loss of my Murali, for my lost dreams,
the days in the mental hospital
My father.
My loneliness, nad all the many lonely
years to come
All this because of him
I decided to make him pay for it
Who is this? It's you sister?
Why at this late hour?
Anyway come in
I was looking for company to talk to
What happened
You killed Murali, didn't you?
L...
You killed him, isn't it?
It happened by mistake
You know murali was my best friend
Your best friend
Did you know who he was to me
Did you know what I was to him
You did not kill just Murali
You killed me too
You destroyed our dreams and our love
Between you both...?
I haven't lived in peace for all these years
I have not laughed heartily
I have committed a mistake
What can I do to undo it?
Give me back my dead Murali
You give me back my father
You can't
You can't give me back anything
You can't give me my Murali
You can't give me my father
What else can you give me back?
I .., It's I who did it!
Suku has regained consciousness
It was Rasiya who did it
Suku should not reveal it to anyone
That girl cannot take another blow
The police have come to
take Suku's statement
He will tell her name
We have to stop him
Can you talk
What happened that night?
Tell me fast
I have other things to do
I tried to commit suicide
Central
Now you know why all our
efforts go waste
There is always something to hide
And pass it off as a suicide
That's the problem with us malayalees
Come along!
You must forgive me
Murali died because of me
Rasiya told me everything
I wanted to fall at your feet
and confess everything
But I was not brave enough
And now I came to know about Rasiya
I don't want to live with your and
Rasiya's curse on me
You kill me!
Will I get back my son ifl kill you?
Will my wife's and my lonely
years go away?
Will Rasiya get back her life?
One death cannot be avenged by another
I know my son Murali
I know you too
I know you will not do such
a thing intentionally
I don't know about Rasiya
But if I can't forgive you a mistake you committed
years back, how can I be your teacher
What is lost is lost!
God has given Murali only a short life-span
I can't bring back Murali.
I can't give you back your father or your life
The only thing I can give you, is my life
that you tried to take
You can take that
I thought we will be alone in our old-age
That's when I came to know
I had a daughter
We are taking her with us
We were unaware all these years that
besides remembering him, there was
Something else we could do for him
She has no hatred towards you now
I thought when we meet again, I would ask you
to forgive me for all the past offences
When we meet after many years, we promised
to help those who are struggling
You leave Rasiya with us
We will look after her
Your new life should not be lived alone
There is another person here who
deserves to live it with you
I'll dispose of my place in Bombay
and come back here
The round eyed girl and the young man with the
new moustache can start their life together
Flight is at 12.30 pm.
Okay l'll go now
-So will we
Only don't steal my mattress like
you did the last time
You don't worry .This time I've taken
precautions for that
I have sprinkled itching powder
on the mattress
What about the itching that will make
me loose my sleep?
This fellow and his remedies
Don't worry father, we will meet again...
