{\an8}Well, after graduation,
{\an8}Noah, Lee, Rachel and I decided
to take one week and go on a road trip,
{\an8}just the four of us.
{\an8}And while I was busy putting off
the inevitable decision
{\an8}between the two colleges
where I got accepted…
{\an8}So, what about you?
{\an8}I... I got wait-listed.
{\an8}Both Berkeley and Harvard.
{\an8}I was fully focused on making sure
we all had as much fun as possible.
{\an8}And that's exactly what we did.
{\an8}Let me run you through the highlights.
{\an8}On our way up to Northern California,
we camped in the woods.
{\an8}- Hey!
- Went fishing on a lake.
{\an8}Fed some wildlife,
caught some waves at Big Sur.
{\an8}Watched Noah becoming friends with Rachel.
{\an8}Watched Lee watch Noah
becoming friends with Rachel.
{\an8}Watched a shooting star
with someone special.
{\an8}Oh, my God!
{\an8}Saw the fish at the aquarium in Monterey.
{\an8}Saw a sunset with colors
I had never seen before.
{\an8}And got a reminder
about rule number 19.
{\an8}Decided to think about it later.
{\an8} Drove to San Francisco.
{\an8}Went to Fisherman's Wharf.
{\an8} Ate clam chowder out of a bread bowl.
{\an8} Watched the sea lions on Pier 39.
{\an8}Watched our naughty video
from chemistry lab.
{\an8}Destroyed our naughty video
from chemistry lab.
{\an8} Rode tandem bikes in Golden Gate Park.
 Rode a speedboat in the bay.
{\an8} Caught a movie.
{\an8} Caught a concert.
{\an8}Even caught a baseball
in a kayak outside Oracle Park…
{\an8}Whoa, whoa!
{\an8}- It's coming!
- I got it!
{\an8}- Whoa.
- Whoa!
{\an8}Oh, my God!
{\an8}Oh, my God!
{\an8}But the absolute best
was watching the Bay Lights
{\an8}with my favorite two guys in the world.
{\an8}But when you decide to escape reality,
{\an8}you know that eventually
you're gonna have to come back to it.
{\an8}So, when we got back home,
{\an8}I got a job so I could make some money
for college,
{\an8}whichever one I wind up going to.
{\an8}Oh, hey, guys…
{\an8}But as hard as that was for me to decide,
{\an8}a few days later,
things got even more complicated
{\an8}when Noah asked
a very unexpected question…
Mmm!
So, anyway, I was thinking, uh…
when you get off the wait-list
for Harvard, maybe you and I
could go off-campus
and get an apartment together.
Wait. You mean, like…
like, get our own place?
Yeah, look.
I've been online all day.
There's some pretty cool places.
What?
- You wanna live with me?
- No.
Yes, of course I wanna live
with you. I wanna do everything with you.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- How long do we have till Lee gets back?
- I don't know.
Geronimo!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, guys. Look what I got.
- Ooh!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Oh, boy.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, fine.
- Um, in fact…
- Hmm.
- Yes, I would like that very much.
- Yeah, I thought you might.
- See you.
- Where are you two going?
Hmm. Noah wants to read me poetry
and tell me all about his feelings.
Really? Is that what you wanna go with?
Smooth move!
Oh, I wanted to show this to you.
What is it?
I have painstakingly coordinated
my Berkeley schedule
with your Rhode Island School of Design
schedule.
- Aww.
- First up, we've got Labor Day.
I know it's early in the semester,
but it's a long weekend,
and I'm pretty damn sure
I'm gonna be having my Rachel withdrawals.
That could work.
Of course it'll work. We'll make it work.
Okay.
This place is so nice.
Thank you for bringing us here.
Well, we wanted
to finally take you somewhere special
to help celebrate your graduation.
So, any big plans for the summer?
Well, actually, now that you mention it,
we were all talking about heading over
to the beach house this weekend,
if that's cool.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Um, we just have some news for you.
We are planning to sell the beach house.
What?!
It doesn't make sense
to hold on to it anymore.
Now that you kids
are going off to college.
You know, the upkeep
on the place is hardly worth it
since we're not even gonna be there.
Truth is
the whole area is being redeveloped.
You know what you sound like, Mom?
You sound like a realtor.
That's because I am a realtor.
Wait, so where are we gonna watch
the fireworks on the Fourth of July?
No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.
You guys are not selling.
I gotta go with Lee on this one.
This house has been in our family
for, like, 80 years.
You can't just get rid of it like that.
Is this a vote? Because I vote "no."
I'm sorry, guys.
It's been decided.
I'll be right back.
Hello?
Miss Evans, this is Don Washington
from UC Berkeley's admissions.
I'm following up
on your decision regarding Berkeley.
Uh, yes. Hi.
Um, is there any way
I could just get another small extension?
I'm very sorry, Miss Evans,
but we need your decision
by end of business day tomorrow.
I knew that I couldn't hide
from it any longer.
Uh, okay. I understand.
- Thank you.
- All right.
The next day,
I had to pick a school
and make one
of my two favorite people very unhappy.
I'ma hit you with a "draw four,"
"draw two." Uno, Uno out.
- Oh, no!
- What? Gosh!
Let's go.
- Did he cheat?
- Unh-unh.
Aww. I miss this.
I feel like I barely see you guys anymore.
Yeah, I know.
- They're keeping you busy at work.
- Very busy.
But don't worry,
I'm still good to babysit tomorrow.
Do you think you're gonna be working
a lot of weekends with this new job?
Uh, yeah, looks that way.
Uh, but I'm not working tomorrow night.
I got a date.
A date?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Um, how many dates have you been on
with this mystery person?
A few. Her name is Linda.
Interesting.
Well, obviously, we,
Brad, are gonna have
to give you a curfew, young man.
Okay. Understood, ma'am.
The next day,
we all drove down to the beach house
to do something
I never thought I'd have to do.
Help the Flynns get ready to sell it.
I had spent literally every summer
of my childhood
hanging out here with Lee and Noah.
And the idea this would be
our last summer here together
was just hitting me.
I was really
gonna miss this old place
in ways I hadn't even realized yet.
Oh.
Oh.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, don't worry about it.
It's always been like that.
- Oh.
- Oh, man.
This is funny. Elle and I,
we used to pretend this was a diamond.
And we would, like, pretend to steal it.
It was like this big jewel heist.
Look how young we all were.
What's weird is it doesn't feel like
all that long ago to me.
You should keep that one.
Mom would like that.
Maybe I will.
Hey, we were thinking
about ordering a pizza.
- Does that sound good?
- Yes, absolutely.
In the meantime, could you get started
packing up the rumpus room?
Oh, ho-ho-ho.
- Yes.
- Yeah, all right.
Come on.
Whoa!
Okey dokey.
Here's what we should do.
We need to make one pile
for the stuff we wanna keep
and then another pile for things
we wanna put in bags and donate.
I wanna keep that one. Yep.
Yep.
That is your hand.
- Nope.
- Yep.
- Oh, you cheater!
- Oh!
Well, that was productive.
Wait. Oh, my God!
I just remembered something.
- Oh, my God. It's still here!
- Our Mario Kart lunch box!
What?! Oh, my…
No!
Wait. Is that what I think it is?
- It's our beach bucket list!
- What?
Oh, my God!
A long time ago,
Lee and I put together a list of all
the crazy things we wanted to do together
before going to college.
It was all of our childhood
summertime dreams and fantasies
listed out
on one very important piece of paper.
- Damn. We put together a solid list.
- Yeah, we did.
We could get arrested for that one.
- Uh, yeah, no, uh, we actually could.
- Wow!
So, how long does it usually take
to sell a house out here?
Well, we have to put it on the market,
but, you know, maybe two or three months.
That's gonna be a real hassle
running out here all the time, though.
What do you mean?
Well, we have to meet with the appraisers,
surveyors, contractors
and the people looking to buy the place.
Well, gee,
that does sound like a real hassle.
Yeah, especially, you know,
with all the road work that's coming up.
I mean that traffic on the freeway,
back and forth and back and forth
and back and forth.
Not to mention all that cleaning.
And constantly driving up
to check on the work that's being done.
Okay, what are you kids getting at?
I am so glad that you asked,
dear parent of mine.
Since this is our last summer here
at the beach house,
and since, like you said,
you're gonna need someone here,
help coordinating some stuff.
We would be more than happy
to stay here for you.
But we would take
amazing care of the place.
So, what do you say?
- We'll talk about it.
- That's a yes! Ha ha ha!
Wait. Not so fast, man.
Not so fast. Deal isn't closed yet.
Guys.
Um…
Come on.
- Okay.
- Yes! Yes!
But this place needs
to be absolutely spotless.
- I mean it.
- Well, yeah, yeah. Of course.
It shall be done.
Your wish is our command.
- Okay.
- I love you.
- Have I told you told that recently?
- I'll be right back.
Not a worry in the world.
We got you, Ma. You're the best.
Admissions. Berkeley.
Hi. Uh, this is Elle Evans. I'm...
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Yeah, I'm just calling to let you know
that I've... I've made a decision.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
What's going on?
I got off the wait-list.
Harvard.
- What? Ha ha!
- Ooh!
Wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
Put me down. Put me down.
Oh, shit.
Crap.
Hang on.
Lee!
Lee!
Lee, can we please talk?
What's there to talk about? You know,
this is just the way things go, right?
No, what... what do you mean?
It's just the way the world works,
you know. Friends leave. They grow apart.
We are...
We're gonna talk every single day,
and I will see you on holidays.
No, because I'm gonna...
Gonna be with Rachel on holidays.
Okay, yeah, that's... that's fine.
But like you told her,
we're gonna make it work too.
And come on, dude. We just...
We landed a beach house, right?
We can make this summer a blast.
- I promise.
- Yeah.
Kind of like you promised
about rule number 19?
That is not fair.
I can't just
not be upset about this, Elle.
Okay, you're leaving me.
I felt horrible
about hiding all this from Lee.
But the truth was I was leaving him,
no matter how much I wanted
to be at Berkeley with him too.
And it was killing me to see him so upset.
All I wanted to do
was show him how much he meant to me.
Lee,
I don't know what's gonna happen.
But what I do know
is that no matter where we are,
you're always gonna be my best friend.
And I just happen
to be holding some list
that says
we could make this our best summer yet.
So, you're saying…
that we do this whole list this summer.
Our best summer we've ever had.
The best summer ever. Period.
I promise.
I mean, rule number 18.
{\an8}Yeah.
{\an8}You got into Harvard.
{\an8}I got into freaking Harvard.
Congratulations.
It was our last summer together…
And I was gonna make it count.
The whole summer?
I promise I can still be here
whenever you need me to babysit,
so you could hang out
with, you know, uh, what's-her-name.
- Linda.
- Right. Linda.
But seriously, Dad,
I'll take care of everything, okay?
Things will be handled, all right?
Milk will be bought,
soccer will be played.
All chores will be done. I swear.
Brad has to be picked up
from soccer on Thursdays.
I'm on call every other weekend.
So, is that a yes?
That is a yes, Ellie-bear.
Yes! Thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
This is so awesome.
Got a really good feeling about this.
Move over.
Huh?
Sorry. Wrong number.
Yo, dude! What's up?
- Oh, my!
- Oh, man!
Oh, my God.
To the last and best summer
at the beach house.
- Yeah!
- Cheers.
Oh, I just wanna let you know
I might have invited a few people
over tonight, you know, to celebrate.
How few?
Hey, bitches!
Hey, girl!
Come in!
Elle, this place is killer.
We thought you were poor.
- Oh, well...
- Is that not crazy?
- That is crazy!
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, we'll see you later. Bye.
- See you, guys.
This is our next door neighbor. Ashton.
- Hi! Welcome.
- Hi.
- Are you a Berkeley guy?
- Yeah, just finished my first year.
Dude, I start in the fall.
Get out of here, man.
Wait. I've got
a million questions. Can we chat?
- Absolutely. Fire away, man.
- Yes! Sick.
Seems like a nice new friend.
Actually, it was nice
to know that Lee would have a friend
when he got to Berkeley.
And I take it you're a Spider-Man fan too.
I don't know. Does driving 600 miles
to find a copy of Amazing Spider-Man #3
make me a fan?
That's another thing.
Oh, man. This is crazy.
But I have to say,
it felt a little weird when I realized
that friend wasn't gonna be me.
Oh!
You know what? I got... I got an idea.
To the, uh,
last summer at the beach house.
And the best summer ever! Period!
Like I said,
gonna make it count.
Good morning. It is one o'clock
in the afternoon, sunshine.
Sports drink and aspirin to your left.
Oh, yes, please.
Well, come on.
Aren't you gonna ask me why I woke you up?
- Why the hell did you wake me up?
- Oh, my God. I thought you'd never ask.
Well, Lee Flynn,
as promised, our bucket list.
I have carefully planned
and very intricately scheduled each item
to make sure
we soak in all of its summery goodness.
Here we go.
One, two, three!
Go!
- Oh!
- Oh, God!
Yeah!
Geronimo!
Oh, my God! Here we go!
Ready? Go!
We got a winner!
Hey, babe.
No! No!
This is the best day of my life!
I'm literally gonna murder you!
- To making…
- Dreams come true!
{\an8}Oh, my God!
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.
Yeah!
- This is amazing.
- You've done this before.
- I swear to you. I've not.
- No.
- Oh, I'm done!
- Yes!
- Hey, Noah! What day is it?
- Sunday.
- What day?
- Sunday!
Oh, okay.
We got him!
- This is the first time this has happened.
- What?
{\an8}Hey!
Bucket list.
Yo! You're gonna be late for work.
Lee.
- Hey, May.
- You don't work here. Stop sweeping.
- But there's sand everywhere.
- Oh, sweet boy.
- Hey, Elle.
- Yeah.
So I have you working a double today.
And then I put you down
for those extra shifts you wanted.
- Extra shifts?
- Mm-hmm.
Uh, okay.
Is there a problem?
No, no, it's no problem. Thanks, May.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Yeah. No problem at all.
Hey, that's my job.
Shh!
- Dude!
- Are you kidding? I just wanna help.
You know, we're not gonna be able
to do all of our bucket list items.
{\an8}Bucket list item number 22.
{\an8}Live together at Berkeley.
{\an8}This one was gonna be tricky.
{\an8}Hey, um…
I've been thinking.
And what if I just went up with you now?
Yeah, we go up to Berkeley.
We'll find an apartment, get set up.
It'll be like we're moving in together
without the actual,
you know, moving in part.
Hmm.
- I accept your offer.
- Ooh, yay!
Hi, guys. Sorry about the wait. I...
- Elle?
- Oh, my God.
Uh, hi.
How are you?
- Oh, my God. It's so good to see you.
- Elle, nice to see you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Um, I haven't seen you since graduation.
W-what are you doing here?
Well, we were hungry.
That makes sense.
You are here, and you are hungry.
Um, of course.
What can I get you? Do you wanna go first?
I've got some recommendations for you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry for the weirdness earlier.
Oh, gosh. Don't worry about it.
I hope things can be cool for us,
since we'll probably run into each other
around here.
Of course it can. Yeah.
Um, are you hanging out
at the beach this summer?
Yeah, I just got a job lifeguarding
at the water park.
Oh, cool. Wait, wait, wait. Is that
the one with the giant go-kart track?
That is the one.
Interesting.
Um, question…
Hey.
Hey, loser. What you up to?
Uh, just doing some apartment hunting.
Good. Your last place smelled
like weird old cheese.
Okay, so listen.
The fam are gonna be
in LA earlier than I thought.
Oh, that's great.
You should come by our place for a bit.
- Come crash if you want.
- Are you sure Elle won't mind?
Maybe you should ask her first.
No, it's okay.
We're in a pretty good place right now.
I think it'll be good.
Cool, cool, cool. You think
you can pick me up when I get in?
- Yeah, of course.
- Perfect. I'll text you the address.
Okay, bye.
That's why it's so funny.
Actually, um, you rushed out of the house
so... so quickly this afternoon.
I didn't...
I didn't get a chance to ask you. I...
I'm sorry.
I've had, like, a million things going on.
But, um, ask me what?
Well, Chloe's actually gonna be in town,
and I told her it would maybe be cool if
she wanted to stay at our place for a bit.
Is that okay with you?
Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, absolutely.
As far as I'm concerned,
that is... that's ancient history.
And she can come
with us to the... the water park.
What's the water park?
Okay, so, totally random.
I ran into Marco and his family
eating at the restaurant,
and he actually has a job
at the water park.
So he's gonna help us
with this cool bucket list thingy.
Oh, cool. Marco.
Wait, that's...
That's kind of a double standard.
I was totally fine with Chloe.
Well, I didn't kiss Chloe.
I didn't mean for that
to come out the way that it did.
I'm... I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
Let's just drop it, okay?
Okay, it's dropped.
Okay.
I'm bored.
So you'll... you'll come to the water park?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll come.
- Okay.
And since you're going,
you can help Lee and I
with a bucket list item.
Oh, God. What... what is it?
What is the bucket list item?
- It's amazing.
- No.
- I'll let Lee fill you in.
- No.
And that's our epic plan for race day.
So, will you help us?
Absolutely not.
- Why the hell not?
- Look, Lee, I'm not gonna wear a costume.
I'll go, be there for Elle…
and whatever this, uh,
little mission is that you got going,
but, uh, that is it.
You know, if you spent less time
worrying about your bucket list,
you might be able
to get that taillight fixed.
I like it busted! And screw you!
What?
Did you really expect him to do it?
Well, yeah, I thought that, you know,
maybe this time he would actually...
No, no, not really.
Well, hey, anyway,
I just wanna let you know how much fun
it is having you here while I'm working.
- But I do have one question.
- What's that?
What does a girl gotta do
to get water on table 17?
- Chop, chop!
- Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.
Hey, Lee.
Hey!
- You ready to go?
- Definitely.
Ready to go where?
I, uh, invited Ashton
to go to the, uh, the comic book show.
Cool.
You didn't wanna go to that, did you?
I could stay here if you need me to.
No, no. Gosh, no. I... I gotta...
Gotta work, so…
- I catch you later?
- Catch you later!
Was I a total hypocrite or what?
Bye. Have fun.
This was my fault, after all.
I was the one leaving Lee.
But even though I wanted
to be with Noah so badly,
I couldn't help wondering
if I should've chosen Berkeley
with Lee instead.
- Hey! What are you doing here?
- Hey!
Wanted to stop by and say I got everything
set up for you at the water park.
No way! Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
No worries.
Is Noah helping out too?
You know, typical Noah.
We couldn't get him to wear the costume,
but he'll be there.
Is he gonna have any problem
with me being there?
No, no, no.
It'll be totally fine. Don't worry.
Hey! What's up, handsome? Come on.
Are you sure you wanna stay at my place?
This is like a really freakin' nice boat.
Okay, listen. The problem is
my dad actually thinks he can drive it.
I'm tired of being told I'm a liar.
Oh, my God, Ron! Do you
ever listen? That is not what I said.
Oh, yeah, and also, there's that.
Please. You gotta get me
the eff out of here, dude.
- Hey, Dad. What's up?
- Hey. Hi, honey.
Uh, listen. Brad's sitter just canceled.
I'm really gonna need a hand
with him tonight.
Um, okay. Yeah, that's…
I promised Chloe and Noah
we can hang out after work,
but I didn't wanna let Dad down either.
So…
- Hey, dude.
- Yo.
…I knew I'd have to get creative.
I have a question.
What do you think
about coming down to the beach house
and spending the night with us?
You can bring Mario Kart.
I'll teach you the ramp jump.
- I think I'll go get my stuff.
- Great!
Awesome.
Do you want some nachos before we go?
- No, Linda already made me some.
- Linda?
Oh!
- So sorry.
- That's okay.
Here, here. Let me fix that.
- No, no, I got it. I got it.
- Oh.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Well, uh, wine disaster aside,
I'm really glad to meet you.
Uh, yeah. You too.
I'm really glad you're here.
Your dad and I were wondering
if you could have dinner with us soon.
Um, you know, I would love to,
but the restaurant has
me working such crazy hours lately.
Um, I... I think
I'm gonna have to pass on that.
Okay.
Well, your mom was an old friend of mine.
It'd be nice to talk about her with you,
but maybe we could do something else.
Yeah, maybe. Um, I... I...
But I'm... I'm kind of in a rush,
so I gotta get going.
It was nice to meet you.
No, you too.
Uh, Brad, I'll be in the car.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Chloe!
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- This is ridiculous. No, no, no, no!
- I'm in.
- Aww. No!
- I'm sorry.
Wow!
- Well, remind me never to play you again.
- Oh!
Maybe you
should have skipped this college thing.
You know, go pro.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm not that good, but thank you.
Oh, my God. Your brother is adorable.
Yeah, he's pretty cool.
Yeah, just, um, babysitting,
'cause my dad is on a date…
Okay.
…with his new, uh, girlfriend or whatever
he's calling her. I don't know.
I just met her. She's kind of annoying.
- No.
- Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
all my friends hate
their dad's girlfriends.
Oh, well, I don't really, like...
I don't really hate her.
Don't worry about it, okay?
I promise you, it's pretty standard.
Everybody was wishing
they were dressed up like us.
What's great was all the looks
were out of pure jealousy.
- They wished they looked as cool as us.
- Yeah, yeah.
Where have you been?
When was the last time
you checked your phone?
Why? Didn't you go
to the... the comic book thingy?
She called it a thingy.
- I got this.
- All right.
So, yeah, we did end up going
to the comic book show.
But then after that,
we went up to meet with our friend Elle
{\an8}for bucket list item number 18.
{\an8}'80s mini-golf night.
{\an8}Oh, my God! No.
- Yes! And it was spectacular.
- Out of this world.
- And Ashton got three holes in one.
- That's cool.
No. I... I just…
Anyway, I'm really sorry, Lee.
Are you mad at me?
No, as long
as we're still good for tomorrow.
- Yeah, come on. Prepped and ready to go.
- Cool. Also, Ashton's gonna come too.
Yay! So fun.
Whoo!
Let's go!
All right, come on, let's go.
All right.
It's time.
Yeah!
What exactly are they gonna do?
It's so stupid.
I told her I'm not doing it.
You can be so stubborn.
- Yes.
- Sometimes you gotta support your lady.
I am. I'm here. I'm supporting her.
That's if she ever shows up.
Oh, she showed up.
She definitely showed up.
Hey!
Oh, my God!
They've been waiting their whole lives
for this.
Wario!
Marco!
Oh, my God. It's Marco!
Wario!
You are my hero.
Gimme a helmet.
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.
You ready, princess?
Affirmative, Plunger-One.
We are go for race day.
All right.
Okay, Melvin. You're my eyes in the sky.
I got you, Elle.
- You're going down!
- Yeah!
And they're off!
I'm pulling up tight, baby. Ha ha ha!
All right, you two. It's go time!
- Line up.
- Don't let them through.
Don't open up any gaps. Okay?
Keep it closed.
We got 'em locked in
with this trio, baby!
Oh, come on! Cheater!
Good job, Elle.
No one's getting through.
- Yahoo! Mario is number one.
- I'm coming for you, Evans.
Hope you're hungry.
Oh!
Aww!
Bloody hell!
- Sorry, Viv!
- Oh, this is great.
Nice lap, Elle.
Watch your back, Chloe!
- Can a lady get through here?
- You got this, princess.
- I'm on it!
- Out of my way, Chloe!
Oh, here we go!
Oh!
No!
Gonna have to try harder than that.
- Hey, Melvin. How we looking?
- Uh, mostly clear, Elle.
But Noah's trying to get through.
Keep in formation, ladies.
- Let him have it.
- Your turn, Luigi.
Whoa! Good throw, man!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
Marco's out of the race.
Whoa!
And now he's back!
Go, Marco. Go!
Whoa!
Whoo!
- I got you, Evans.
- I don't think so.
Oh, my God!
She slimed me! I can't see!
- Gotcha!
- That was amazing!
Oh, Elle!
Oh, no.
- No!
- There can only be one!
You got me!
Okay, guys,
coming up on your final lap.
- Hey, pretty boy. What are you doing?
- Winning.
You are dead meat.
- Lee!
- Sorry, Rach.
Rachel's out! And now there's an opening.
- Whoa!
- Marco and Noah are through.
Melvin, what's going on?
Marco and Noah
are going at it pretty hard.
Uh, Noah.
Noah, can you hear me?
Whoa!
Noah!
 Noah is pulling ahead.
Now, it's Marco. They're neck-and-neck.
Yeah!
Marco wins!
 Oh, boy.
That was incredible.
{\an8}What? Oh, it's glorious.
{\an8}- That was insane!
- Oh, my God, guys, that was insane!
Hey, can you hold this for a sec?
Yeah.
Close one.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's okay.
Come on.
- Don't be mad just 'cause you lost.
- You know what I keep thinking about?
Why the guy that you kissed
in front of the whole world
is wearing the costume
that you asked me to wear.
- Noah! You blow things out of proportion.
- Why's he wearing it?
It's very clear
that he's still after you...
He's not. There's nothing
going on between Marco and me.
If you think that he's not
still after you, then you're being naive.
It's embarrassing.
It's embarrassing.
God. I'll see you at the house.
Hey, thank you so much again for today.
It was amazing.
Of course. Any time.
You're the best.
Sounds like Noah was pretty upset.
You know what?
I don't even care.
What we just did was legendary.
I don't know.
I sort of think he might have a point.
What?
Listen, I just don't think
I would be too happy
if Rachel started hanging out
with an ex of hers all the time, you know?
Okay. First off, he's not my ex, Lee.
And second,
it takes two people to do something.
Which means Noah doesn't trust me.
It's him that I don't trust.
I mean,
he clearly still has feelings for her. So…
Look, if you trust her, then you gotta
believe what she says and nothing less.
Is everything okay?
Uh, yeah. It's just...
Just stuff with my parents.
What's going on?
It's nothing.
My dad just told me that him and my mom
are getting a divorce,
and now they won't stop calling
to check up on me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, please.
Just don't make a big deal about it, okay?
Eight ball, corner pocket.
- Third time's the charm.
- Third time.
It's always the third time.
What's that about?
What is that?
What? Wait a minute.
What?
No way.
I cannot believe
they're getting rid of our DDM machine.
Wait. The DDM machine.
What are you doing?
I'm adding a final item to our list.
The last DDM dance on our machine.
July 5th. You'll be there, right?
I don't know
if it was the fight with Noah
or that everyone seemed
to be coming at me at once,
but I was starting to feel overwhelmed.
- What? You don't wanna do it?
- Of course I wanna do it.
But we literally have one month left
to finish the entire bucket list,
and then we leave for school.
Yeah.
I get it.
You got your hands full. It's okay.
But just like Lee…
Lee, hold on please.
I'll be there.
…I wasn't ready to let go yet either.
Okay. Thanks.
And we're still on for tonight?
All right, we put a lot of work in it.
- So we can't be late.
- Yeah, no, don't worry. I won't be late.
Noah, you did all of this?
I wanted to make up for yesterday.
This looks amazing.
I thought you could use a night in.
You deserve it.
What's wrong?
Well, there's this…
God. I have this thing with Lee, and it's
like we've been planning it for weeks...
Please don't tell me
it's a bucket list thing.
I'm sorry. I feel horrible.
You're actually gonna go?
I mean, I made you dinner.
- I did this for you, and you're leaving?
- No, it's not like I wanna go.
Listen, we're gonna be
in Boston together all next year.
I just feel like
I'm leaving him all alone.
Me asking you to come to Boston
isn't some, like, evil plot
to make you leave Lee behind.
No, I... I'm not...
That's not what I'm saying at all.
Listen, I'm gonna be back
in an hour, okay? I swear.
Fine. Do whatever you want.
Noah. I...
Please.
I'm sorry. I…
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, of course.
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.
What is that noise?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Oh, my God!
- That was crazy, right?
- That was crazy!
{\an8}The truth was, I was doing
the bucket list to soften the blow to Lee
{\an8}so it would be easier
to go to Boston with Noah.
But every step closer we got
to finishing the list…
Noah?
…made me feel
like I was one step further away from him.
You awake?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
I'm painting the trim.
Okay, well, you can paint everything else
in this house, just not this doorway.
Well, Mom told me to do it, so…
I don't care what Mom said.
You're not painting this doorway.
- Stop being a jerk, man. Just move.
- I'm not moving!
Fine.
You're gonna have to sleep at some point.
Brad!
Brad!
Brad!
- Brad?
- Yeah.
Thank God.
Where were you, dude?
I couldn't find you anywhere.
I'm right here.
Well, yeah,
but I was supposed to come get you.
Hey, Elle. I wasn't expecting you.
Can I get you a plate?
What?
No, no, I'm here because I was supposed
to get Brad, and I couldn't find him.
Oh, Elle, I'm so sorry.
Your dad told me how busy you were,
and I offered to pick up Brad.
Oh, didn't he text you?
No, he didn't.
What I would like, though,
is for you to contact me directly
if plans change.
I really am sorry.
But with you working
and grocery shopping and watching Brad,
I just felt like you might need a hand.
Well, you were wrong.
We've been taking care of ourselves
quite fine for a while now.
Milk was bought.
Are you okay?
Just not this week.
- Can I do anything?
- Mnh-mnh.
Nope. I got it covered.
How much longer on table 25?
Just hold your horses.
Whoa!
Son of a bitch!
Hey, you are working.
You... you doing okay?
Not really.
I still don't understand
why you guys ended up fighting.
I guess once we moved in together,
everything kind of fell apart.
Wait. So what, you're just gonna give up?
I'm not giving up.
I'm just tired of fighting.
Well, then do something about it.
Like talk to her or fight for her.
Anything. God!
Between my family and the job,
and just trying to make it up to Lee
after lying about Berkeley,
I just feel like
I'm running around like a crazy person.
As far as living
with Noah in Boston goes...
Oh, gosh. How much time you got?
As much time as you need.
You're really sweet.
Hey, what's wrong?
Just go away.
No, I'm not going anywhere.
What's going on?
It's my parents. They just...
They don't even wanna try
and patch things up.
They just want out.
You know,
you see all the problems,
and you hear all the fights,
but you still think
they're gonna find a way to figure it out.
Listen, why don't I come back
at the end of your shift?
We can keep talking.
- Really?
- Sure.
Okay, yeah.
That'd be kinda nice.
Look at me.
I'm a 23-year-old woman, and I'm crying
because Mommy and Daddy are breaking up.
Stop.
God, I feel
so pathetic right now.
You don't have to do that.
Not with me.
Oh, gosh.
Should probably
get back to work.
Thank you.
Come here.
I'll see you later.
Sorry. We're closed.
Hello?
Hi.
May I have this dance?
Noah Flynn wants to dance?
Yeah, just this one time.
I don't like fighting.
Me either.
But I'll fight for you.
I'll fight for you too.
Hey, dude. Could you, like, not mess up
that room? I just cleaned it.
Your mom has buyers coming
in, like, 30 minutes.
What have you been doing all morning?
You're doing it wrong. Here, gimme.
I do not understand
why you're helping her sell the house.
I'm not. I'm just taking care of it
like we promised.
- Boom! There you go.
- Whatever.
Traitor.
So what time do you wanna leave
for, uh, Berkeley next week?
- Oh. Oh, man.
- Elle…
I know. I know.
I know. I know, but listen.
Noah and I, like, literally just made up.
And things have been kinda off lately,
so…
I feel like I should stick around.
Sure.
- It's fine.
- Thank you.
That afternoon,
I couldn't stop thinking
about what I knew I needed to do.
- Hi.
- Hey, Marco, um…
I just wanted to call, and... and, um…
say sorry about last night.
Uh, Noah came by,
and we, uh, sorted things out.
Oh.
Okay.
Uh, that's... that's great.
Yeah.
Um…
But thank you so much
for being there for me.
I mean, that really meant a lot.
Yeah, of course.
And if you ever wanna talk
or need anything,
you know, just call me.
Okay?
Day or night. I mean it.
Thank you.
Um, I'll let you get back to work.
Uh, take care.
All right, bye.
Hey, Tuppen. What's up, dude?
Great.
So what are you doing
for the Fourth of July?
So I was cleaning out our room,
and then it just fell out of her bag.
So what did you find?
She had an acceptance letter to Berkeley.
Which means that she was never
on the wait-list.
- Wow!
- I guess she found out, like, in May.
Well, I guess that that does show how much
she wants to be with you in Boston.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
So, look what I got us.
Oh, my God! Lee, how did you get these?
Wait.
These are for the concert on the 22nd.
We're both in college orientation then.
Yeah, I figure we could skip orientation
so that we could spend more time together.
- Oh, hi, Ellen!
- Ellen, how are you?
- Happy Fourth of July, Ellen!
- How are you?
Welcome to the party.
Hey!
Oh, Randy! Okay, bye, Elle.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.
Hello, Randy!
- Hey, I hope it's okay I'm here.
- Um…
Tuppen was, like,
pushing me hard to tag along.
Yeah, yeah, of course. Hi.
- There's, you know, food and drinks…
- I can't believe that Marco showed up.
I know.
- So, have fun.
- Cool.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Whoa! One to one.
Let's go!
All right. Whoo!
- Oh!
- Whoo!
- Ha ha!
- Come on!
Whoo!
MVP, baby!
- Let's go!
- Match point. All tied up.
Oh! Oh!
- Good game, dude.
- Good game.
- That's great.
- Yeah!
Hey, close one.
Yeah. Nice shot, asshole.
You know, you shouldn't be a sore loser.
And I'd appreciate it
if you watched your mouth.
Yeah, I'm just trying to have a good time.
You're the one trying to hurt somebody.
Hmm. And what are you trying to do?
Look, this little innocent friend thing
you got going on,
nobody's buying it.
- It's very clear what you're here for.
- Really? What is that?
You still want Elle.
- You shut up.
- Guys, can you please stop this?
You still want Elle,
and everybody here knows that.
Yo, I said shut up.
The sooner you get that through
your thick skull, the sooner you...
Noah!
I'm not doing this.
You okay?
Noah!
Noah! Noah!
Noah, please…
Will you please say something?
I asked you
not to let him back in our lives.
Wait, Noah!
Noah, wait.
Elle! I am so sorry.
- I cannot believe that you just did that.
- He... he was pushing me.
- I didn't know what to do.
- I don't care!
You just... you seriously...
You need to not be here right now.
You just need to go.
Look, Noah was right.
And you know he was.
Look, I know I've messed up a lot,
but it doesn't change
how I feel about you.
And I know you're not meant
to be with that guy.
- No.
- Please just give me a chance and I'll...
Stop it. Stop it! Stop!
You need to go. Please.
- Look what I found.
- Oh, Monopoly!
Yeah!
- The game…
- …is on!
Okay. Brad, you do the honors.
Is that your favorite game, Brad?
- It is my favorite.
- Oh, wow! Yes!
- I'm gonna set up these pieces.
- This one's for you.
He's very particular.
Oh, and I call the race car.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hang on.
We have to roll to pick our pieces.
- Play by the rules!
- Okay.
She's serious.
All right, I got this. I got this.
- Yes!
- Oh!
I get to choose. Whoo!
And I will choose the doggy.
Oh, no, no, actually... sorry.
I'm... I'm always the Scottie.
Come on, Elle. I rolled first.
- Come on, Elle. Come on.
- I get the doggy. Right is right.
It doesn't matter.
Come on, Elle. Give her the piece.
Sure. I'm just... yeah. I wasn't...
Didn't really wanna play, anyway.
Oh, no, hang on. You have it.
I want you to have it. Here.
I don't really care what you want.
- Elle!
- What?
Well, I'm sorry, Dad. I'm...
She can't just, like, walk into our lives
and be all part of it
like she's just been here the whole time.
Linda, you don't belong here.
No matter how hard you're trying to.
Elle!
What was all that?
I'm sorry, but I cannot stand her.
The way that she's trying
to force herself into our lives.
- What are you talking about?
- She's not Mom.
She never will be.
And I just think it's selfish of you
to even be doing it.
- Selfish?
- Yes.
I've spent the last six years of my life
making sure
that you and Brad are my only priority.
I put that part of my life on hold.
I even took a job that I hate
to earn more money
to help you with school.
You stand there and you call me selfish?
- Dad, I didn't realize... Dad, I had no...
- No, Elle. No.
Do you really think
that you are the only person
who needs love in their life?
You have no idea
how disappointed in you I am right now.
So…
my mom told me a little secret
that I think I'll let you in on.
There's, uh, two things in life
that are worth spending a little extra on.
First one is, uh, quality trash bags.
What's the other one?
Bacon. Obviously.
I really messed up yesterday.
Your dad will forgive you.
And Noah will come back.
He always does.
Yeah.
- Thanks for helping me clean up.
- Of course.
Rule number three.
{\an8}Rule number three is a good one.
{\an8}Always help clean up your bestie's messes.
Um, are we still good
for the arcade later?
Yeah.
I'm glad you remembered.
Of course. I wouldn't miss it.
Lee was right.
Noah would come back.
But I wondered where he was.
And then it hit me.
Hi.
Hi.
Um…
you were right about Marco.
And I'm really sorry.
I didn't handle that well at all.
Yeah, I guess maybe
we both could've handled it differently.
Yeah.
We've been fighting a lot lately.
I mean, I guess.
But you know, I've...
I've just had so much pressure on me, and…
we really haven't had
any alone time together.
I think maybe it's more than that.
Elle, you and I have been trying so hard.
I know.
Let's say we keep trying.
But this and then in a year's time,
it doesn't work out
and, you know,
you've moved across the country.
You've given up
everything you wanted for me.
Yeah,
but that's for me to decide.
I... I think... I mean, I would think
that I would know what's best for me.
No, you do. You... you do. You definitely
know what's best for you, but…
I don't wanna be one of the people
who makes you put yourself last.
What does that mean?
Look, Elle, I don't wanna be responsible
for a decision you make
that you're gonna regret.
Listen, now, you can reapply at Berkeley.
No, you can go to school with Lee
like you wanted.
I just don't wanna be the one
that kept you from being with him.
- It's my decision to go to Boston!
- I can't be respon...
Why do you think you get
to decide these things for me?
I'm not trying to decide anything...
Look, I know better than trying
to stop you going to Boston.
But if you do decide to go…
…it's not gonna be with me.
So, that's it?
The fact that we love each other
means nothing?
I do love you,
but maybe sometimes loving each other
just isn't enough.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Yeah.
No, no.
Shit!
Shit.
Lee…
I'm so sorry.
Somehow I'll make this up to you.
That is what this entire summer was about.
Making it up to me.
Well, forget it.
I don't need it.
Please don't do this.
Elle, I have nothing more
to say to you right now.
You know that I wanted to be there.
It's just this...
This thing happened with Noah.
You seriously cannot be this upset.
It is just a game, Lee.
Is that really
what you think this is about?
The game? What, do you think I'm five?
It's not just about the damn game, Elle.
It's about you fighting
for our friendship.
Lee, I know you're upset, but this is...
And I don't matter to you, really.
Not compared to him. I never have!
You know what?
God. It's like you are five.
You have never had
to worry about anything.
You've had everything handed
to you your whole life.
And now,
you accuse me of not caring about you?
You know, everything that I've done
this summer, everything,
for you and for everybody,
just probably proves that I care too much.
This was supposed
to be our best summer ever.
But it was never gonna be
because all of those things that just made
our summer so great before, that's gone,
and we're never gonna get that back.
But you know what? Maybe that's the point.
Maybe we're not supposed to.
At least those of us who have
to grow up at some point.
Oh. Oh, and... and new rule.
Yeah, all of our rules are done.
You can't hold on to someone.
The tighter you hold on,
the more they wanna slip away.
I should have taken my own advice.
I'm sorry.
At some point in everyone's life,
there will be a moment when you feel
there isn't a single place on earth
where you actually belong.
This was that moment for me.
Morning.
Hey.
I'm gonna head out,
so I just wanted to say goodbye.
How are you?
- I don't know if you heard, but...
- Noah called me.
I'm really, really sorry.
Things definitely didn't turn out
how I expected.
No, for him either.
But there is one thing I know,
and that is that whether he was ready
for this relationship or not,
he really does love you.
Guess loving each other
isn't always enough.
Maybe not.
Sometimes the timing just isn't right.
You take care of yourself.
You too.
For whatever it's worth…
I want you to know
that I think
you are an absolutely brilliant woman.
Thank you, Chloe.
Lee. Noah.
No, it's just me.
- Oh, hey, uh…
- Hey.
I didn't know you were coming today.
I could've taken care
of whatever you needed.
No, no, no, it's fine.
I have to meet
with the environmental engineers anyway.
They have to approve
any shoreline demolition.
Wait. They're tearing the house down?
Putting in condos.
This day
is just getting worse and worse.
Lee told me everything last night.
Yeah.
And, um, Noah and I
are pretty much done too.
Elle, can I talk to you about something?
Yeah.
Other than Noah,
why did you wanna go to Harvard?
- What do you mean? It's Harvard.
- Yeah.
- Why wouldn't I wanna go there?
- True.
It's just that the whole time
I've heard you talking
about where you
were going to go to school,
I never once heard you talk
about what you actually wanted
to study once you got there.
Yeah, I mean, like, lots of people
figure out what they wanna study
once they start
going to a college, though.
I know.
But did you ever stop
to think that maybe your choice of school
had more to do
with what other people wanted for you
rather than what you wanted for yourself?
Maybe it's time that you think
about what it is that you want to do.
Figure out what your dream is,
what you're passionate about
and then choose a school based on that.
And not let anyone
or anything change that.
Thank you.
Come here.
Now you just have to figure out
what you're passionate about.
Is that all?
Hey.
Hey, I'm glad you're here.
Uh, what do you think
about this idea I'm working on?
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Hey, Lee, can we talk?
Uh, yeah, what's up?
Elle and Noah broke up.
What?
- You talked to her?
- Yeah.
You should really call her.
She doesn't wanna hear from me.
Not after what I said to her.
Well, everything that's happened
with Elle and Noah
got me thinking about us.
You know, I've watched them trying
to keep up
their long-distance relationship,
and I saw how hard it was.
Rachel.
- If I did something, I swear I can fix it.
- Lee, no, no. It's not you.
School is gonna be really tough
for both of us.
And I just don't think
that we should make it harder
by trying to make a relationship work
from so far apart.
So you're breaking up with me?
You mean so much to me,
and I just don't want
to see us end up like they did.
And who knows? Maybe...
Maybe if we're meant to be together,
we'll find our way back to each other.
But I love you.
I love you too.
I don't mean to, but…
…I screw up a lot.
And you've done so much for me.
I would never want you to be unhappy.
And I had no right
to stand in the way of you and Linda.
I don't want you to be disappointed in me.
I'm not disappointed in you, Elle.
We all make mistakes.
It's what you do after
that shows who you are.
- Hey.
- Hi, Linda.
What are you doing here?
Linda…
…I really just wanted to apologize
for my behavior the other night.
The Scottie dog piece,
it means a lot to me because that
was the piece that my mom always picked
when we would play Monopoly together.
And it was...
Yeah, I know that sounds stupid.
It just... that's...
No, it doesn't sound stupid at all.
I understand.
Thank you.
Elle…
…I would never dream
of trying to replace your mother,
but I did care about her a lot,
and I have some stories that I'd love
to share with you
if you wanna hear them.
I would love that.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
Bye.
I wanted to reach out to him,
but I couldn't,
because if I did,
I knew it would be to say goodbye.
And I wasn't ready to say goodbye.
Not yet.
- Yes! Bam!
- Oh-oh! I can do that too.
- Wait, no!
- Okay, again.
No! No way…
And just as it is every year,
in the blink of an eye, summer was gone.
And it was time for all of us
to start our next adventure.
I kept waiting for Noah to appear.
I was filled
with an odd mixture of feelings.
Desperately wanting to see him,
but dreading
that he might actually be there.
Looking for someone?
I have a feeling it's not me.
But like you said…
…I'm not the one.
Well, apparently, neither is Noah. So…
I'm sorry.
But I'm glad we got a chance
to say goodbye before I go.
- Finally pick a school?
- No.
Gap year. I'm going to New York.
I wanna try to work as a musician there.
Wait, really?
You never told me you wanted
to go to New York.
I've always wanted to go.
But besides my family, there was
only one thing keeping me in LA, and…
and that's all over now.
Well, good luck. You're gonna kill it.
Thanks.
It's my new moonshot.
Well, goodbye, Elle Evans.
Goodbye, MVP.
People pass through our lives.
Some of them fade into memories,
but a few become part of who you are.
One, two, three. To Ellen!
Whoo!
It's still Elle, but whatever.
It was hard watching all of them leave.
None of them were perfect,
but in their own way…
Hey.
…each was a big part of my life.
- Best of luck.
- Vivian, get out of here with that.
Come here. I'm really gonna miss you.
And now, looking back…
Yeah, don't forget about me.
Get in here.
…I'm not ashamed
to say I loved every damn one of them.
Yeah, of course.
- Bye.
- Bye.
So you got accepted to Berkeley?
Yeah.
Why are you showing me this now?
Because that's what I should have done
in the first place.
You were right.
You should've told me.
And you would've been okay with that?
No, probably not.
See? This is what I mean. I...
It took me hurting both of you
to finally realize what the problem was.
I just… I care about you both so much
that I've spent my life,
you know,
doing what's best for our relationships,
but I haven't really gotten
to spend much time figuring out
what would make me happy.
What are you saying,
that I don't care about your happiness?
No, no! It's not... it's not really
about anything that you did.
It's holding something back
so that I wouldn't hurt you,
even if it hurt me.
You know?
I just really have to stop doing that.
I, uh, I heard about you and Noah.
Yeah.
So then come to Berkeley with me.
It's worth a shot.
This is what I'm talking about, though.
I chose Boston to be with Noah
and Berkeley to be with you.
But I gotta figure out who I am.
On my own.
Come here.
I'm really sorry
about what I said at the arcade.
I didn't mean it.
Yeah, you did.
That's okay.
A lot of it was true.
Then I am sorry we didn't make this
our most memorable summer ever.
I don't know.
That may be exactly what we did.
So, um, you know where you wanna go?
I think so.
Come in.
Hi, um…
- I...
- Miss Evans.
What a surprise.
You remember me?
You won the only dance competition
I have ever judged.
So safe to say, "Yeah, I remember you."
What can I do for you?
Hey.
Mom said you were taking off.
Yeah, that's the plan.
You knew she got accepted into Berkeley,
didn't you?
What are you talking about?
You ended things with Elle,
so that she wouldn't miss the chance
of going to college with me
like we'd always planned.
You know, there were a lot of reasons
Elle and I broke up.
I didn't want her
to make a decision she was gonna regret.
You know,
but just 'cause we're not dating anymore
doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop protecting her.
So, is she gonna go to Berkeley, or…
No, actually.
She, uh, she's applying to USC.
She wants to do video game design.
All right.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah.
Hey.
I'm not sure if it's my place
to say this or not,
but that thing you said earlier
about always needing to protect Elle.
It's not true.
She's always been able
to take care of herself.
The only thing she ever really needed
from you was…
was for you to love her.
Anyway…
I'll be seeing you, brother.
I knew Noah
was leaving the next day.
But sometimes,
there are goodbyes so hard to do,
you just wanna skip 'em.
And the way that I felt
about saying goodbye to Noah
was actually the same way I felt
about saying goodbye to the beach house.
Happy birthday!
I couldn't bring myself to take it.
It seemed like if I left the photo,
it would always be hanging there
in the same place forever.
I hope you don't mind
how I addressed this,
but it's how I feel about you.
Your warmth, guidance and kindness
have been some
of the best parts of my life.
And I can't begin
to say how thankful I am for it.
Instead, I'm enclosing a small gift
and sending it with all my love.
Elle.
Hey.
You didn't think I'd let you get away
without saying goodbye, did you?
I was gonna stop
by your place on the way out.
- Hey, you fixed your taillight.
- No, I didn't.
- Noah.
- Yeah.
- Um…
- I guess this is it.
It feels so weird
to be leaving without you.
I added a new one.
"Rule number 35."
"Always call your bestie
every time you miss them."
I love it. Thank you.
So, Mrs. Flynn,
I believe you'll find the paperwork
for the sale of the properties in order.
We only need this last signature
to finalize the deal.
And I can't begin to say
how thankful I am for it.
Instead, I'm enclosing a small gift
and sending it with all my love.
Elle.
Is there a problem?
Mrs. Flynn?
No.
No problem at all.
I'm just not selling this house.
You'd be walking away from millions.
All of these old homes
are being taken down.
Just not this one.
Good day, gentlemen.
 Oh, that's a great one.
- That one's so... the light is perfect.
- You think? I mean, I don't know.
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Yeah, cool.
Do you think that maybe I should…
So you're going to USC?
Uh, I...
Yeah, I have an interview
for their spring term next week.
It's a really competitive program,
so I probably won't even get in.
Are you kidding me?
You put your mind to something, you do it.
I don't know. We'll see.
Hey, I'm sorry
that things didn't work out between us.
It is what it is, Noah.
Me too.
Don't forget me, okay?
Goodbye, Noah.
Elle,
take care of our game while I'm away.
Until our next dance.
Your best friend, Lee.
Yeah. Classic Lee.
One of the things that we do here,
at the video games department
is we pitch and develop our own ideas
into finished products.
We were hoping
that you might pitch any ideas you have
for possible games or gaming products.
Yeah, of course, totally, definitely.
Oh, you mean, like, right now?
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that
I was supposed to prepare that for today.
It doesn't have to be anything formal.
Just a sharing of concepts.
Right, of course. Um…
Um…
I...
Oh, my God. Um, I'm so sorry. There's...
Nothing's coming to my mind.
I just... I don't know what to say.
Look, it's not a problem, Elle.
Uh, actually,
I... I think we have everything we need.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.
I... I did have one idea.
But it's... I mean,
it's really just more of a basic concept.
Go ahead, Elle.
Um…
You know how in fantasy sports,
people draft real-world sports athletes,
and the players' performances are used
to determine the success of...
I think we're all aware
of how fantasy football works, Miss Evans.
Cool, yeah, sorry.
Um, of course.
What if we were to apply that
to a large e-sports platform?
Players could get together
at the beginning of the season
and take turns drafting
their favorite pro players.
And you could even call it
"Fantas-E Sports."
And fantasy football's, like,
a multimillion-dollar industry, right?
It's $7 billion actually.
See? There you go.
And how much
is the e-sports industry raking in?
Uh, two billion.
So, I mean, it kind of seems
like that might be worth something.
Oh, and I also have this other idea…
Hey, what's up?
I think I got in!
Yes!
{\an8}Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Okay, you have to tell me. What happened?
Okay, so I got in there,
and I was so nervous…
So Lee and Rachel did end up
getting back together again.
It turns out that sometimes
people do find their way back
to each other.
Lee and I stayed connected
all through college.
And after graduation,
Lee moved back to Los Angeles.
And for us,
it was like no time had passed at all.
We had both changed a lot,
but our friendship hadn't.
And in the fall of that year,
we all found our way back
to a very familiar place.
Oh, my God!
No way!
And suddenly, there it was.
Lee!
- They're still doing this?
- They're still doing this.
Oh, my God!
Aw!
The kids at school
were still using the Kissing Booth.
And for just a second,
I felt the same thrill and rush
that I felt the night I had my first kiss.
And then I saw him.
Again.
Hey, Shelly.
Hi, Noah.
Noah!
- Hey!
- Hey! Fancy seeing you here.
- It's good to see you, brother.
- Ah, it's good to see you, bro.
- Aww! Good to see you, guys.
- You too.
- Congratulations again.
- Thank you.
- When's the wedding? Have a date?
- Yeah, we're thinking, like, late May.
Okay, late May. Can't wait.
Well, we were talking about
maybe going and getting some churros.
- Okay, churros.
- Were you now?
So we'll catch up with you guys later?
Yeah, it's good to see you, bro.
- You too.
- Bye.
- Wow.
- Can you believe this?
No, I don't wanna look at you.
It's been a long time.
Yeah.
You look so business-y.
Uh, I mean, don't let the suit fool you.
You know, I'm still a rebel.
- Oh!
- Last Friday, left work 20 minutes early.
Whoa!
- I know. I don't like to talk about it.
- Okay.
- Your secret's safe with me.
- Don't tell anyone.
Oh, okay.
Uh, so Lee told me about your job offers.
There's a law firm in New York
and one in LA.
I don't know which one
I'm gonna choose right now.
Congratulations. That's amazing.
And Lee told me
that you're developing video games now.
- Your own game?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm designing games. It's great.
I work at a really small company.
- But there's great opportunity.
- Okay.
And I have a lot of creative freedom,
so I really love it.
Well, I'm glad.
- What?
- I don't know, you just...
You seem so grown up.
I was gonna say the same thing about you.
You know, it feels like yesterday
you were just crashing your scooter
down the driveway.
- Well, I'm a much better driver now.
- Oh.
I even have my own motorcycle.
Really?
Okay, well, um,
I mean, when I'm in town again,
we should go for a ride together.
I mean, if you'd like that.
I would like that. That sounds fun.
Great.
Well, I've gotta...
I gotta go see some friends,
and then I've got an early flight, so…
- No, of course. No worries.
- But, no, I'll call you, okay?
Sure. Yeah, if you've got time.
I've got time.
- I'm gonna go. Okay.
- Okay, all right.
I'll see...
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- See you. Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Standing there at the carnival
and seeing Noah again after all that time,
I couldn't help but think of one thing.
That all of this happened
just because of...
Well, you know.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Welcome to The Kissing Booth.
Whoa! Holy shit!
Oh, yeah.
Nice and heavy.
Smooth move, bro!
Smooth move!
- Actually in the movie, I'm dying.
- You should've kept it!
I've gotta burp.
No, it's not coming.
I'll just do it after the take.
What? Lee! Oh, my God!
What in the... what was he thinking?
Take the apron off, Lee, and go home.
Uh, yeah.
Sorry about that, May. Good talk.
Brad is...
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my heart is beating so fast.
It's okay. That's normal.
That is just fine.
That is just fine.
Best line of the movie.
- I'm gonna fall!
- I'm gonna...
Just stop this thing!
- Whoa! Shit. My bad.
- Shouldn't have said "shit."
Ooh! That was weak, mate.
That was so weak.
Come on, give it to me.
Holy shit!
This is nuts!
You told me to walk away, right?
We've been dancing on this machine
since we could walk.
What do you want me to do?
I want that machine
to stop making noise.
I think my feet still smell
from yesterday.
Very nice.
- Hey, Vince.
- Oh, good job, man. Thank you.
Well, that's his. You shouldn't
be keeping track of that.
Taylor!
- Let me just go get us another snack.
- Oh, okay. Is Marco here?
- Hey! Come on, come on, come on!
- Really, man?
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanna say...
That guy is reckless.
- Eight ball.
- Nope. Nope.
Come on.
Hold... hold on.
- What is happening?
- I had a script sitting right here.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Wanna play some hoop ball?
Oh, my…
Like a boss!
Get in there!
Whoo!
- Hi.
- Hey.
This looks amazing. Thank you.
Holy shit!
That's gross.
And Harvard tour this weekend!
- Really, Harvard?
- Yes.
Harvard. Shit.
It has all been taken care of...
I'm sorry.
That is perfect!
- I love you, Marco! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Absolutely no order!
All aboard!
You are buying me a new apple. I swear.
I can't even handle you
as a friend anymore.
We're over. We're done. We're through.
That was so stupid.
