[ Older Man ] I was planning
to replace him in the new year,
but in the light of the wind of it,
I decided to give him the push now.
There's a young priest
called Greg Pilkington.
Down south at the moment. Wants to come
up here, do his bit for the inner city.
- What's he like?
- He's a wee bit more orthodox than you.
Mind you, Colonel Gaddafi'd be
a wee bit more orthodox than you.
- [ Phone Ringing ]
- Yes?
Oh!
Put him through.
Hello. Yes.
Fine.
Yes, I've got that.
Uh-huh.

Hello.

Hello.
[ Women ]
Hello, Father.
[ Women Chattering ]
- [ Fr. Greg ] Why did you do it?
- Because he sacked me.
- Well, we've all got to go eventually.
- It was the way he did it.
I gave it my life. In return,
I got a cup of tea, a biscuit...
and "It's time to move on, old son."
Oh, he looked up
from what he was writin'.
"It's time to move on,
old son."

Hi. Sorry I wasn't here

- Hello.
Hello.
- So, uh, tea?
- Well, that would be nice.
Right.
Sitting Bull.
Nobility,
even in defeat.
So, uh,
she's our housekeeper?
Yeah.
It's an article of faith-- isn't it--
somewhere between transubstantiation...
and papal infallibility:
Housekeepers must be ugly.
- Sorry.
- [ Pouring Tea ]
Nice word:
scapegoat.
It dates back
to an old Jewish custom.
They used to invest all the sins
of the tribe into a goat.
Then kick it up the backside so it escaped
into the hills taking all the sins with it.
And we've got
a scapegoat today.
It's that mythical beast
called society.
Drug addiction;
alcoholism;
gambling; prostitution;
violence.
They're not
our sins anymore.
They're not the fault
of the individual anymore.
They're society's fault.
- Well, I'm sorry, I don't understand that.
- [ Sighs ]
What did you think?
Interesting.
You didn't like it.
I found it offensive.
You expect less of the people
because they live in a poor parish.
I find that offensive.
Patronizing.
Really?

[ Man Speaking On TV ]
[ Man Singing In Spanish ]
[ Fr. Matthew ] The creation of
mankind only started on the sixth day.
- µµ [ Fades ]
- It hasn't stopped yet.
We're taller than we were
a thousand years ago.
We're fitter, faster.
We live longer.
We're better educated.
More informed.
So, creation...
is an ongoing process.
And if you interfere
with it,
aren't you spitting
in the face of God?
If you exploit
your work force,
- don't you spit in the face of God?
- [ Man ] You do.
If you kill and maim,
throw people out of their homes,
turn your back on the elderly,
if you shut down schools
and hospitals,
force people out
on the dole--
In fact,
if you do anything...
to prevent one single human being
reaching their full potential,
aren't you interfering
in creation...
- and spitting in the face of God?
- [ Man ] Yes.
That's what I believe.
That's my truth.
That's what made me
become a priest,
- [ Watch Ticking ]
- and makes me remain a priest.
The peace of the Lord
be with you always.
[ Congregation ]
And also with you.
Let us offer each other
the sign of peace.
- Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you, son.
[ Congregation ]
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you.
- [ Man ] Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you.
Peace be with you, Father.
- Peace be with you, Maggie.
- Peace be with you, Father.
- Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you, Father. I know what you're thinkin':
Any minute now, he'll take
his pants off. [ Laughing ]
Peace be with you.
It wasn't a sermon. It was a party political
broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party.
- There's social sin and there's personal sin.
- It's just sickening!
- I think we should put more emphasis on the social.
- There's just sin.
Matthew, you can't change the rules just
because they don't suit you; There's just sin.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
Are you judging me?
For God's sake,
get rid of her.
[ Thunderclap ]
I was in South America
for four years.
In the village
I was in,
you had to have a woman,
otherwise you were ignored.
So I got one,
fast.
Where is she now?
She's still there.
- She served her purpose?
- Well, that's what you wanna hear, isn't it?
So, yeah...
I dumped her.
You're very certain of yourself,
aren't you, Greg?
- Well, I'm not.
- Yes!
- A few months in this parish, you'll be a lot less certain.
- [ Scoffs ]
- A few years-- - No, I've
looked around at other priests--
A few years and you'll be
utterly confused. A few years--
Those middle-aged trendy lefties jumping up
with excitement every time a factory closed...
- or a war breaks out!
- A few years more and you might learn a little bit of humility.
Spiritually empty, fastening onto other
people's misery, fighting other people's fights!
Anything to fill the emptiness inside!
To hell with that!
We're priests. We're not bloody
social workers. We're priests!
Sacraments;
reconciliation;
moral guidance;
that's our job.
Moral guidance.
For God's sake, Matthew.
Moral guidance from a man
with a bit on the side.
If you're gonna judge,
you should know all the facts.
- We love each other. He's asked me to marry him.
- [ Thunder Rumbling ]
That means him leavin' the priesthood,
so I've said "No."
Oh, not because I'm a martyr
to the faith.
Because one day he might regret it, and I don't
want to see that look in his eyes if he does.
Anything else
you should know?
Oh, yeah.
I seduced him.
He didn't seduce me.
I've got a few bob
stashed away...
and I'm in a pension scheme in work, so we
won't be destitute when he pops his clogs.
Anything else you want to know, I'll be
out there washin' your pots and pans,

to your underpants.
Okay?

when does he stop pattin'

When she's 14?
And why does
he stop pattin' it?
'Cause she doesn't like it?

[ Altar Boy

When supper was ended,
He took the cup.
Again, He gave You
thanks and praise.
Gave the cup
to His disciples and said,
"Take this, all of you,
and drink from it.
This is the cup
of My blood,
the blood of the new
and everlasting covenant.
It will shed for you
and for all,
µ Judge me now µ

so that sins
may be forgiven.
Do this...
in memory of Me."

Who was he?
And you couldn't
give him communion?
No.
I never denied
anyone communion.
They had more right to receive it
than I had to give it.
Have you always
been celibate?
But I'm not proud of it.
It's a gift from God.
He gave me
the gift of celibacy.
He gave you
certainty of vocation.
Two totally
different gifts.
I want both.
Ah, now,
that's being greedy.
Sitting in my room,
sweating.
I turn to him for help.
I see a naked man...
utterly desirable.
I turn to him for help
and he just makes it worse.
Up there in my room...
that's my Gethsemane.
I understand humanity then;
every sin, every compulsion.
I understand it all.
Saliva, racing pulse,
adrenaline;
the ecstasy
before the fall.
And, Matthew--
What I should say is, Matthew,
I can't smile and hug...
and preach the beauty
of creation,
because inside here there's just
sin and sickness and evil and--
Whoa.
I was going to get out,
Greg,
when I was your age.
But it would've broken
my mother's heart.
So I waited.
By the time she died...
it was too late.
There was nothing else
I could do.
Get out now, Greg,
while you still have
your health and strength.
Love who you want,
when you want.
Get out.
I can't get out.
God wants me
to be a priest.
I don't think it,
I don't just... believe it.
I know it.
I'll pray for you.
[ Man ] And what about them new flats they
built, eh? You remember them, don't you?
[ Mrs. Unsworth ]
I know what you're gonna say, Tommy.
[ Tommy ] They rent them in no time
at all. It's houses they want...
with a front
and a back garden.
- That is what they want.
- Yeah, you're right. Those flats are what they wanted.
And they rent them
in no time at all!
[ Mrs. Unsworth ] Look, what I'm saying
is housing isn't the answer on its own.
There's a whole load of other stuff.
I mean, jobs for a start.
How's Lisa?
Um-- Uh, well, she's fine.
Uh, she's with her dad.
[ Tommy ] Just a minute, let's get
one thing quite straight, ehh--
Before you put 'em in decent houses you gotta
get 'em a decent education, decent jobs...
- and decent God knows what!
- That is not what I'm saying, Tommy.
- [ Voices Become Distant ]
- What're you gonna do with us then?
Maroon us all on a desert island until
you've got everything just there?
You can't just put 'em in a house with
hot and cold water and say, "There you go.
That's my bit." I'm talking about values.
I'm talking about changing attitudes.
- [ Tommy ] God, give me patience!
- Changing attitudes takes...
- [ Thumping ]
- a bit of money and it takes education.
- [ Thumping Continues ]
- [ Mrs. Unsworth, Tommy Arguing ]
- [ Thumping Stops ]
- I'm sorry, I can't go on with this.
[ Tommy ] There you are.
It must've been
something you said.
Do something!
Don't just hang there, you smug,
idle bastard! Do something!
Feminists and liberals,
that's all you need, isn't it?
[ Group Chattering ]
Ooh! Early finish,
eh, Philly?
- [ Slams Fist ]
- I'm gonna tell someone. That's what you'd do.
She's a 14-year-old girl.
You wouldn't see her suffer.
You'd say, you'd say,
"This girl is me.
This girl is all-suffering humanity.
For this I came."
You wouldn't give a damn about the
church and its rules and its regulations.
The secrecy of confession--
How can that be good...
when it allows evil
to thrive?
You'd speak out!
You'd speak out.
I know you'd speak out.
- [ Man Talking On Radio ]
- [ Fr. Greg ] Our Father who art in heaven,
- [ Door Shuts ]
- hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...
- as we forgive those who trespass against us.
- Hiya.
- And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen.
- Mmm.
But you could speak out.
You were the Son of God, for God's sake.
You could make the rules.
You were the Son of God. I'm not!
I'm just a priest. I'm a,
I'm a, tuppence, ha'penny priest...
- and I can't take on 2,000 years of history!
- [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ]
That would be pride.
That would be arrogance.
They'd, they'd crucify me.
Our Father
who art in heaven,
- [ Alarm Sounding ]
- hallowed be Thy name.

on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil. Amen.
I look around for an example.
I'm in the depths of despair.
I look around for an example,
and all there is is you.
But you perform miracles.
You change water into wine.
You raise the dead.
You, you cured the sick.
What kind of example is that?
How could you possibly know despair?
"Oh, well, I'm feeling a bit low today. I
think I'll, I'll raise somebody from the dead."
How could you, with that kind of power,
know what I'm going through right now?

- [ Arguing ]
- Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses...
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation

Get out!
Get out of our house!

And this is the eighth:
- "Jesus Meets the Sorrowing Women."
- [ Coughs ]
You can see
the women crying because...
Jesus is in such
a pitiful state.
- [ Sneezes, Coughs ]
- Jesus doesn't want their tears.
He's saying to them,
"Weep not for me,
but for thy children."
The prayer
we usually say here goes,
- "My Jesus, laden with sorrows,
- [ Footsteps ]
I weep for the offenses
I have committed."
You knew.
You knew.
What kinda man are ya?
The ninth is, uh...
"Our Lord Falls

We'll quote John, Chapter Eight: "Let him
who is without sin cast the first stone."
- I can't do that.

Compassion, ladies and gentlemen.
You sin, you go to a priest,
you expect compassion.
If you expect it from him,
shouldn't he expect it from you?
Compassion,
forgiveness, understanding.
- [ Reporters Chattering ]
- Has the Pope said anything about this?
[ Nurse ]
He's got the right to some privacy!
What's Matthew
been saying?
Well, he's been
very supportive.
He thinks... being gay
has made me a good priest;
human, compassionate.
He thinks that all that's happened
recently has made me a better one;
more human...
more compassionate.
Go out and commit mass murder,
he'd want you canonized.
When you say you want
to carry on serving God--
Well, that's good.
The best way for you to serve God
is to disappear.
The best way for you to serve God is to
piss off out of my diocese. Is that clear?

- It's our parish!

I won't be your crusade.

about what men do
with their dicks?
[ Sparse Chuckling ]
Do you ever doubt
in the existence of God?
I do. It's not war,
famine and disa-- I mean, the--
These things make me angry,
yeah, but they don't make me doubt Him.

- But when I look at the church today...
- [ Door Shutting ]
and see careerists

and...
Pharisees thriving...
- [ Watch Alarm Beeping ]
- in positions of power,
then... I doubt
the existence of God.
How could He
let this happen?
That judge--
What's he called?
Denning.
[ Man Coughing ]
He said,
he'd rather see innocent men
rot in prison...
than for the British legal system
to be ridiculed.
He put pomp and ceremony,
the cap and gown,
before the principle itself.
That's what
we're doin' now.
Churches, cathedrals,
bishops, popes.
All the trappings of power.
We care more about that
than the thing itself.

You're a boil
on the body of Christ.
A monstrous,
living, breathing boil,
ready to erupt at any moment
into pus...
and blood and stench.
I think I preferred it
in Latin.
You'll be paid a pound
for every Mass you say,
and you're not to go out
after dark.
Fine.

Do any of you read the Notes
and Queries page in The Guardian?
Look, I know you
don't want me here.
But in a way,
hasn't God sent me?
[ Doorbell Buzzing ]
- You've broken the vow of celibacy, that's all.
- Bollocks!
So you should demand to be treated
the same as any other priest.
- Heterosexual, homosexual, it doesn't make any difference.
- Utter bollocks!
You've broken a man-made rule,
that's all.
It's there for the protection of property
to keep it away from the widows of priests.
- Christ was celibate.
- It's there for the mobility of labor.
- No wife, no kids, so you can kick a priest...
- Christ was celibate.
-from one end of the earth to the other.
-Christ was celibate!
Look, Matthew, the church gives us
everything: money, food, shelter, respect.
And all she asks
in return is celibacy.
Christ gave his life.
All we're asked for is celibacy
and we can't even manage that.
- Christ didn't ask us to be celibate. It's manmade.
- Solemn vows!
- It's a manmade thing.
- "Do you solemnly swear?"
That's our currency, Matthew:
Solemn vows.
And we debase them because
we can't even stick to them ourselves.
What's his name?
Graham.
[ Thunderclap ]
- Do you love him?
- I despise him.
[ Fr. Greg ]
Satan comes in many forms.
[ Fr. Matthew ]
This is the man who gave you his body.
How dare you talk
like that?
In the name of God, Greg,
you gotta ask yourself--
Now, look at me,
look at me when I'm talkin' to ya!
To call another human being
Satan, I mean--
What kind of religion
is that?
What kind of sick,
twisted brainwash...
have you been through?
His sole purpose in life is to tempt you
into sin, is that what you're sayin'?
You're Christ
and he's just the bloody serpent.
Is that what you're sayin',
you arrogant prick?
I think I love him.
Yes.
Do you want him?
Yes.
All the time?
A lot of the time.
And is that sinful?
[ Exhales ]
Sick.
So... to itch for a man
is sick;
to want to scratch that itch, to want to
make love to another man, that's sinful?
Yes.
And to want to go on scratching,
to live with another man--
Well, that's permanent sin.
That's evil.
That's "depart from me,
ye cursed" stuff, right?
[ Chuckles ]
Yes.
[ Sighs ]
Is there any sense...
any intellect, any...
common humanity
in that kind of bullshit?
- [ Chuckling ]
- What're you laughin' at?
- You laughin' at me?
- [ Panting ] Yes.
Don't patronize me, Greg.
I patronize you?
I live it, Matthew.
You think you can just walk in here and
spout some glib Guardian reader crap,
and bang, all's right with my world;
I'm reconciled to my nature.
Cue the uplifting music.

"And the Lord rained upon Sodom

"Let him who is without

"Keep my statutes

and do none of these

"Judge not...
that you be not judged."
Gaagh!
"Lord, how often shall
my brother sin against me...
- You know what the Holy Father says about it. You know!
