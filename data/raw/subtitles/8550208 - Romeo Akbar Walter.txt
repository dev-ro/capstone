The year is 1971.
This story is of the time when
Pakistan was divided in two parts.
West Pakistan and East Pakistan.
Today, East Pakistan
is known as Bangladesh.
The people of East Pakistan...
were upset with the brutality
of their government.
The cry for freedom was
reverberating across the country.
It led to the merciless slaughter
of thousands of innocent citizens.
There was an exodus of
refugees from East Pakistan...
who were trying to enter India.
In these circumstances,
even the Indian government
was in favor of East Pakistan's freedom.
Both the nations
were on the brink of a war.
Grandma, a peacock took your peahen
A crook took away what remained
I had started a project some time back.
I needed a person...
who could easily be sent...
across the border.
One man stood out amongst the others.
This man could change colors
like a chameleon.
He had the talent to blend in anywhere.
And lastly, I would like to
say a few lines.
Please listen.
"Affection is something musical
Affliction is just like melody
The heart is a drop of blood
Its color is blushful
There is a desire in this color
And every desire is colorless"
Come in.
It was a fantastic performance, dude!
Thanks for the compliment, bugger!
I never imagined you could have
any talent besides counting money.
Thank God! You finally
found me worthy enough.
Shall we go, Romeo and Juliet?
We are getting late for the party.
Give me five minutes.
Oh, Bulle Shah
Oh, Bulle Shah
Meet my eyes, dear
Let's stare at each other for some time,
My love
I am mesmerized by your beauty
Meet my eyes, dear
Let's stare at each other for some time,
My love
It's an amazing feeling
It was my choice to surrender and die
The arrows of your beauty
Were launched at me
Your companionship is amazing
-Oh, Bulle Shah
-Where is my heart going?
-Oh, Bulle Shah
-Where is my heart going?
-Oh, Bulle Shah
-Where is my heart going?
Be the shower of love
Be mine
I have left the world for you
Your eyes are so pretty
Embraced with kohl,
I dwell in your eyes
Look around
There are signs everywhere
I don't say anything
But everyone does
Your companionship is amazing
-Oh, Bulle Shah
-Where is my heart going?
-Parul.
-Oh, Bulle Shah
I think it's been two months
that I have been asking you.
Shall we go for a movie tomorrow?
I promise I will not hold your hand.
Whose hand will you hold then?
You add colors to my life
You fill me with happiness
Your companionship is amazing
-Oh, Bulle Shah
-Where is my heart going?
-Oh, Bulle Shah
-Where is my heart going?
-Oh, Bulle Shah
-Where is my heart going?
Mom.
Why didn't you sleep yet?
I had told you I would be late.
The bank had a...
Mom!
My loving mother!
Stop with the drama.
Have you eaten?
Mom, would I ever give up
your stale and burnt rotis?
Stand up.
Stand up!
Stand straight.
Don't move.
Mom, did you have dinner?
Have I ever eaten without you?
Warm up the halwa for me.
Tell me something,
how do you get time for theatre?
-I--
-The manager is looking for you.
Go.
Ram Singh, give me a cup of tea.
What happened to your leave application?
Can't you see the kettle
dangling from my hand?
My request is dangling--
-Put your hands up!
-Put your hands up!
Where are the keys?
-Put your hands up!
-Where are the keys?
Put your hands up!
Stand straight!
Where are the keys?
Where are the keys to the safe?
-Can't you hear?
-Where are the keys?
Where are the keys to the safe?
-Where are the keys to the safe?
-Can't you hear?
Put your hands up!
-Come on!
-Put your hands up!
Where are the keys to the safe?
Put your hands up!
Where are the keys to the safe?
Put your hands up!
Ratan, pick up the gun!
Parul, call the police!
Come here!
Asset taken.
Romeo alias Rehmatullah Ali,
son of Subedar Major Gulrez Ali.
He was martyred in the
1962 Indo-China war.
Vir Chakra awardee.
Your father was your favorite hero.
You wanted to follow
his footsteps and join the IMA.
But after your father's death
your mother forbade you from doing so.
Where are the keys to the safe?
-Put your hands up!
-Put your hands up!
Srikant Rai.
You…
All of this?
I want to prepare you
for a kind of performance...
which can change India's future.
I know it will not be easy for you
to make the decision.
Your mother means everything to you.
Your life begins and ends
with your mother.
But the truth is that...
you are the son of the martyr
Subedar Major Gulrez Ali.
He got martyred to protect his country.
Romeo, the country needs you.
You are earlier than usual!
Yes, Mom.
Your father had taken us to Delhi
to witness the Republic Day parade.
You started saluting as soon as
the national anthem played.
Mom, I have been promoted.
The bank is sending me for
training for a few months.
Sending you?
What will I do here?
It's only a matter of a few months.
Please serve me food.
Only one factor determines
whether wars are won or lost.
What, when and where is
the enemy planning?
You will be staying in this house.
There is something unique about
Mohammad's tea and this place.
You are looking at things
but can you really see them?
You will need to get used to observing
nuances in a single glance.
Tell me something
about your childhood, Romeo.
Me and Dad...
Sir, I think you know
more about my childhood.
Anyway.
Dad loved trekking.
And Mom...
She avoids walking.
Did you observe anything?
It crossed us twice.
I never thought you would
be following my editorial.
I have to follow it.
How come you are here so early?
I have an interview with Madam.
Placing a field agent
in such a hostile area and...
that too in this position--
Sir, in order to gather solid intel...
we need to take some risk.
But, at what cost?
Along with this project, you are
risking so much personally.
Well!
I shall sign it...
as you came here with Madam's approval.
The responsibility for this project
is yours and...
only yours.
After independence,
I was a soldier in the Indian Army.
Romeo,
we are among the few fortunate ones...
who got a chance to serve their country.
Always remember and respect this honor.
You are being sent on
an undercover mission.
You will have to keep in mind...
If I say your tea is cold,
then I'm actually trying to
tell you that you don't need to drink it.
You will never be spoken to in a
straight forward manner.
You will have to interpret the truth
and understand it.
And what if I'm not able to do that?
It will be easier to find your way out.
I'll be with you at every stage.
Stop the bus.
Stop.
Show me your ID.
Show me your ID.
You are trying to enter the
country with forged documents!
He seems to be an Indian.
Take him away and
investigate him thoroughly.
Show me your ID.
You do not exist in the records anymore.
Your new identity will be...
Akbar Malik.
Akbar is a Pakistani Kashmiri
living in POK.
His parents were killed eight years ago
in a cross fire at the border.
Akbar works as an
Assistant Manager at POK Hotel.
For work purpose,
an important guest is coming from Karachi
to stay at the hotel.
Isaq Afridi.
A Pakistani who loves
his country more than himself.
He is very close to the
Chief of the Pakistan Army...
and a key for your lock.
Thank you, Akbar Malik.
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Wa alaykumu as-salam.
In the last four months, there have been
two attempts to assassinate Isaq Afridi.
Those who know have said
that there is only one person...
behind the attacks.
His son, Nawab Afridi.
Just a minute, sir.
Dear, what's with the tape
on your fingers?
I like to fly kites.
This is one of the rewards
for cutting others' kites.
I like to fly kites as well.
Let's have a duel
whenever we get the time.
Then we shall see who
rules over the skies.
Inshallah, of course.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
The kitchen is closed and
the chef has left as well.
No problem.
Mr. Afridi, if it's alright with you,
I can take you outside for dinner.
Where are you planning to take me?
Somewhere nearby.
There is a shop owned by
Khan Chacha at Rusul Street.
Their meat delicacy is--
Wow!
I hope you are not a spy.
You know everything about me.
Are you a local resident?
Yes, Mr. Afridi.
My house is beyond the mountains there.
You stay near the border.
Yes, sir.
My father used to own a lot of property
across the border.
In India?
Not India, Kashmir.
India rendered us homeless.
And your parents?
They died eight years ago.
We had apple orchards here.
Apples!
Take some juicy apples!
Take some juicy apples!
How are you doing?
All good?
-What's your name?
-What's your name?
Take some juicy apples
for 25 paisa a kilo!
Take some juicy apples!
-Take some juicy apples!
-How much is it for?
Take some juicy apples!
Mr. Afridi!
I'm fine.
Nawab followed us here as well.
For how long we will remain silent?
Brother!
Thank God, you are fine.
We will care for you much better
than government hospitals.
You will not be bothered
by the police here.
I came to know from the hotel...
that you had already resigned.
They wanted to transfer me...
to a new branch, out of the country.
But I don't want to leave Pakistan.
Will you work with me?
In Karachi?
I will light a cigarette to signal that...
Isaq Afridi is heading in your direction.
When you reach Karachi, you'll
first meet a person...
known as Joker.
It's not just a name but a position.
This person runs the operation
for me in Pakistan.
Only I know
Joker's real identity and work.
Akbar Malik.
Qureshi butchery.
In five minutes.
The cigarette packet is a way
to communicate with me.
Use it only when you fear being exposed,
or you need to meet the high command.
You will meet the high command only
through my secured network.
The details of your future movements
are in the cigarette packet.
This is our first and last meeting.
May I know your name?
Here's some advice.
Do not say anything
that can get you into trouble.
It will make your stay here a lot easier.
Allah Hafiz.
Liaqatabad! Liaqatabad!
-How much for the apples?
-Half a rupee for one kilo.
Give me a kilo.
Mr. Akbar!
How do you know my name?
Why were you following me?
I do not have the nerve to follow you.
I was just keeping an eye on you.
I was ensuring that
nobody is spying on you.
Joker has sent me.
Mudassar?
You are choking Mudassar.
I am your servant.
Welcome to Liaqatabad.
Come.
Come in.
This is your house.
What do you know about Joker?
Sir, the lesser
you know about him the better.
Please come.
This is your office.
You are tuned in to Akashvani.
You heard that beautiful
number requested by Mr. Iqbal.
Let's listen to the next requested track.
This is your transmitter.
Come here.
Here, keep this for your safety.
I wish to God that
you may never have to use it.
Joker messaged.
Oh, Allah
Oh, Allah
Akbar!
Akbar!
I got you!
Sit.
With Allah's grace,
we have pulled off a massive arms deal.
It's a significant contract.
We need to make this delivery to
East Pakistan in seven days.
The rest of the details are in this.
Alright, sir.
How does Afridi get such contracts?
It is not that tough, sir.
The Chief of Army,
General Jahangir Alam...
gets a hefty percentage of every deal.
Their tie-up is dangerous for two people.
Isaq Afridi's son, Nawab Afridi...
and the one in Pakistan Army,
ISI chief,
Lieutenant General Ghazi Ali Hayat.
They are best friends.
They are just waiting for an opportunity
to replace the Chief of Army
and Isaq Afridi.
There is a message from Akbar.
A huge consignment of
arms is being delivered.
In East Pakistan, two units
of the Pakistan Army's
23rd Infantry Brigade have been spotted.
Chief, it seems like Pakistan
is preparing for a war.
They are planning something else, Awasthi.
Javed, please put it carefully.
-Mr. Rafique.
-Yes.
What's with the army contingent
in our office?
General Jahangir is coming
to our office.
The General?
There must be something important.
Miss?
Miss, please clean up outside.
Mr. Siddique,
without a thorough review I…
Mr. Afridi,
I was talking to Mr. Siddique…
Later.
Mr. Siddique, I'll speak to you later.
Excuse me.
Come, sir.
-Hot and roasted chickpeas!
-The bus is here.
Can I have some?
Here, sir.
Hot and roasted chickpeas!
The birth date of
India's Father of the Nation.
The birth place of Gautama Buddha.
Joker messaged.
Akbar wants to meet me.
Passengers of PIA's flight number 213
are requested to board the plane.
Greetings.
The spokesperson of the Mukti Bahini
has issued a statement from Badlipur.
Thousands of citizens...
have taken up weapons for the
liberation of East Pakistan.
There may be a storm brewing.
In such a situation,
I might need a companion.
Is there any
particular reason for meeting me?
My mother.
Whatever happens tomorrow...
my mother should always be taken care of.
We will always take care of her.
"My loving mother..."
The situation in East Pakistan
is getting even worse.
The Mukti Bahini has all areas
under their control near Badlipur.
The Indian Army is
-Hands straight!
-training the rebels there.
Ready to shoot!
And to fight against us in this war...
India is even sneaking in arms to
East Pakistan through Badlipur.
Badlipur, a small village at the border,
has turned cancerous for us.
Mr. Afridi, in such situations,
we have to remove the tumor from the body,
regardless of what we want.
We'll destroy Badlipur
through an airstrike...
from Abdulabad air base in East Pakistan.
We will neither attack the enemy territory
nor violate their airspace.
That's it.
In one fell swoop, we'll destroy
the enemy's biggest strength.
All this without starting a war.
We are cleaning the waste
from our own house.
Even if they want,
they cannot do anything about it.
The world cannot know about the
involvement of the Pakistan government...
or our military in this operation.
I want your help to make this happen.
We need Dakota plane, cluster
bombs and non-Pakistani pilots.
Operation Badlipur... is a critical
and top-secret mission.
We will carry out this operation on
the night of November 22...
when India would be celebrating Diwali.
When the infidels celebrate Diwali,
we will burst some loud crackers.
The arms contract...
and the infantry battalion movement...
They were distracting us at
the ground level.
But they were planning to wipe out
Badlipur with an airstrike.
Many innocents will lose their lives.
Besides, our army members
outnumber the locals there.
And you know that we cannot
initiate the war...
When is Madam attending
the UN Assembly meet?
She will attend the conference
in Geneva on November 20.
That's two days before Diwali.
Three days ago,
the Dhaka University was attacked.
The Pakistani soldiers slaughtered
22 scholars and students.
This file has all the
details of that incident.
Rehana.
I want you to publish this news two days
before Diwali, on November 20.
Neither a day before,
nor a day after.
Awasthi.
With this news, the entire world
will have its eyes on Pakistan.
If they still go ahead with their plan
to kill Indians in Badlipur…
And to avoid this,
they will be left with only one option.
And that is to stop bombing Badlipur.
Aunty, he has written that
he has been promoted.
He has a bungalow and servants.
Life is good.
That's all?
Didn't he mention when is he coming back?
"I will be back soon. You haven't
hit me for quite some time now."
Allah, please give him a long life.
Akbar Malik.
You need to come with us.
Come.
I hope you are fine, Mr. Akbar.
Firstly, I'm sorry to call you this way.
Honestly speaking,
I was eager to meet you.
Nawab Afridi.
Please have a seat.
No problem, Mr. Nawab.
I at least got to meet you.
So kind of you.
You won my father's heart
and now he has forgotten me.
Rest assured I am not
stopping you to work with him.
Just share some contract details
and some personal information.
In return,
you can have anything you want.
Mr. Nawab,
betraying one's trust for a price...
is not my nature.
As you wish.
But you cannot go without having
our famous pudding.
I'll be really upset.
Khuda Hafiz.
Allah Hafiz.
Mr. Nawab!
I think you forgot this envelope.
Thank you.
Actually, I wanted to deliver it
to room number 117.
I would really appreciate it
if you could do that for me.
Sure, Mr. Nawab.
And you are also invited to the feast.
We have organized a small party
at Continental Hotel.
-Sure.
-Thank you.
Let's go, Rehmat.
You?
Yes, sir.
I'll be there tomorrow.
I'll meet you there.
Yes.
Nawab Afridi has sent this for you.
Allah Hafiz.
At your altar, I pray
If not you,
Who else will I share my pain with?
If you don't hear me out,
Who else will?
Mr. Nawab, she has come here
through the invitation you sent.
Allah
I seek your help, Allah
The right of God, light from Allah,
You are my God
-You are the messenger of God
-Oh, Allah
-You are my dear God
-Oh, Allah
-You are the purest
-Oh, Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Peace be upon him
So, I was the reason that you
were working in the bank?
I shed tears
If not you,
Who else will I share my pain with?
But the telephone in your hotel room?
They doubt on every Indian diplomat.
Why are you here?
You needed a partner in this season.
Slowly, the world changes
Who knows what's right or wrong here?
The world is not what it looks like
Here, time doesn't wait for anyone
You will continue to track Isaq Afridi.
The Pakistan Army and ISI
will be on my radar.
I'll be monitoring their every movement.
We need to stop
Operation Badlipur at any cost.
You are Allah's beloved
Oh, Messenger of Allah
You are my dear God
Oh, Messenger of Allah
You are the purest
Oh, Messenger of Allah
You are Allah's beloved
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Oh, Messenger of Allah
Romeo Ali.
I must admit, sir.
Your government has carefully
chosen an excellent candidate.
Forget about me, tell me about yours.
Why is a Pakistani working
for an Indian intelligence agency?
What work?
I am only paying for my mistakes.
Actually, I acted stupid.
I was smoking ganja and
smuggling drugs on the border.
The BSF caught me.
And I became a pawn in
the hands of Joker.
Haven't you ever thought of
leaving all this?
How can one consider that?
If they ever guess that I'm useless...
they will shoot me.
And I...
I don't want to leave
my little one all alone.
You have reminded me
of my loved ones.
I'll be back.
Your clothes are ironed
and kept on the bed.
I know you will take care of yourself.
Don't forget your mother.
You are my only son.
Mom, have you ever thought of
joining the theatre?
Are you mocking me?
Sir.
-You?
-Sir, here it is.
-Yes, sir.
-Let them know.
I'll be there tomorrow.
Nawab Afridi has sent this for you.
Hold on!
-Adil.
-Yes, sir.
Play it again.
Sit.
You?
Who is this lady?
Shraddha Sharma.
She's an Indian diplomat.
When did she arrive?
Two nights ago.
It's her first posting.
Play it.
Yes, sir.
I'll see you there tomorrow.
You?
Listen to the word "you" carefully.
You?
This person already knew her.
Thank you.
That's all.
Mr. Afridi...
yesterday I--
You met Nawab.
And he tried to buy your loyalty.
This has not happened
for the first time, Akbar.
But, yes...
you are the first one
to give him an adamant reply.
You...
I am his father.
Akbar,
I see a glimpse in you of...
what I always wanted to see in my son.
Assalamu alaikum, Mr. Nawab.
Masha Allah!
Wa alaykumu as-salam.
Please take a seat.
Iqbal, please get two cups of tea.
Mr. Nawab,
did you send somebody with an
envelope to the hotel yesterday?
Yes, Akbar Malik.
Why?
Akbar, we have been entrusted
with a huge responsibility.
A Dakota plane.
And non-Pakistani pilots.
We need to arrange these
before November 22.
Fine, sir.
Akbar Malik.
A Pakistani Kashmiri comes to
Karachi and works for Isaq Afridi.
He works so brilliantly
that in three months...
he impresses the top circles.
Khan, his papers and
documents are in order.
-Just because you suspect him--
-Sir!
Sir, such extraordinary growth?
He seems to be part of a conspiracy.
I want to keep him under
top-level surveillance.
Please sanction it.
I'll need clearance from
the higher authority.
He is close to Isaq Afridi.
Considering that General Jahangir
and Isaq Afridi are close...
this will not be easy.
Please try to understand my problem.
Three months.
In just three months, he has become
the right-hand man of Isaq Afridi.
Nothing harsh.
Ensure that nobody gets to
know about it.
Yes, sir.
-Latif.
-Yes, sir.
Activate the high frequency
wireless detectors in Liaqatabad.
Okay.
-Tap Akbar Malik's phone.
-Okay, sir.
-Immediately.
-Yes, sir.
Give that to me.
Take this.
No, not there.
Keep it near the door.
Akbar.
We can't meet here like this.
You know--
I have been asked to make arrangements
for Operation Badlipur.
What was the need to take such a risk?
You could have sent it through somebody.
One feels like meeting
some people in person.
-Miss, I have kept all the boxes.
-Yes, I am coming.
Romeo Ali.
That's the name, right?
Your field agent has done wonders.
The intel on Operation Badlipur
is pure gold.
In the light of these developments,
his role has become very critical.
Can he really be trusted?
You very well know that even
today there are many Muslims who--
Mr. Surve, he's just an Indian for me.
Not a Hindu or a Muslim.
That's what you think.
But the question is,
what does he think?
-Hello.
-Hello.
Madam was waiting for you.
Please come.
-This one has too much recoil.
-Okay.
-It is jerking a bit.
-Okay.
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Wa alaykumu as-salam.
This is the quotation.
The pilot and the plane
have been arranged.
Money is not a thing
to worry about for patriots.
Akbar, one important thing.
The date has been changed.
Instead of November 22,
the plane...
should land on 19th morning
at Abdulabad air base.
Its next flight should be on that
very night at 10:30 p.m.
Sir.
The time right now is 08:00 p.m.
Let's move on to our next request...
Is the bombing on the night of the 19th?
According to our plan...
the media story was to
break on the 20th morning.
But now, they would have already
carried out the attack by then.
That means our plan...
They're getting to know everything.
That's why the bombing is now on
the 19th instead of 22nd.
But Chief...
the only people who knew about
the media story were you, me and…
Today,
former Prime Minister Gulzari Lal Nanda
criticized Indira Gandhi.
He accused her of dictatorially
misusing the intelligence agencies.
For further comments...
Why are you here?
Under whose orders?
Heavy rains in this season!
Not really.
There are many places where
it rains heavily in this season.
Awasthi.
Arrange an urgent meeting for me
with the Mukti Bahini leaders.
In Calcutta?
Rehana Kazmi has--
Put East Pakistan on low profile.
Do exactly the opposite
of what we had planned.
Why the sudden meeting?
There's a message from the high command.
Stop whatever we are doing to
prevent Operation Badlipur.
But...
There are only five days
to Operation Badlipur.
But the high command has
sent a clear--
Not five, only four days.
Today is November 15.
My mother's birthday.
Coming to Pakistan has made me realize...
how much I miss my loved ones.
With your company, I feel a bit better.
Let me be confined in your love
Let me devour it
Let me drink all the love
I see in your eyes
Let me have it
Let me hear everything
Your soul wants to say
Let me revel in it
Let me be confined in your love
Let me devour it
Sir!
-When?
-At eight o'clock.
Yes.
Come in.
Sir.
Sir, yesterday at 08:00 p.m.
high frequency signals were detected
through the wireless detectors.
A message is sent to India.
Triangulate it.
We have done it, sir.
The message was sent from Liaqatabad.
Yes, sir.
Liaqatabad.
Akbar Malik stays there as well.
I am not lying. You can
inquire anywhere in the city.
They can't be
more sweet and juicy than these.
I swear by God.
Ma'am, somebody has sent these for you.
Sir.
The phone in Akbar's cabin
is ringing continuously.
Where's the call coming from?
Somewhere nearby the Indian Embassy.
Assalamu alaikum.
Akbar...
I needed your signature
on the consignment sheet.
Right here.
-Mr. Afridi is looking for you.
-Okay.
Sir, as soon as you left somebody
started calling Akbar continuously.
The call was made from somewhere nearby
the Indian Embassy.
Drive faster.
One unit is heading towards Liaqatabad.
Akbar Malik.
Sir, he's not at home.
Sir!
Listen to me, sir.
-Check outside.
-Sir!
-Check outside.
-Sir.
Sir!
Go there.
Sir, what is the matter?
The show is called Chhaya Geet.
This is your host Shahnaz Mantri.
Let's begin the show...
I like listening to Indian film songs.
-Is it?
-Yes.
Let's talk about love.
Step aside.
Love is like a mix bag
of happiness and sorrow.
But since the weather is so pleasant,
let's not listen to sad love songs.
Grandma, a peacock took your peahen
A crook took away what remained
Grandma, a peacock took your peahen
A crook took away what remained
After eating and drinking,
The crooks sat in a train
And cutting the box, as crooks do,
Ended up straight in jail
With whose permission
are you breaking in my house?
Akbar Malik.
Let's go to the headquarters
for questioning.
Show me the warrant.
It is the police who need a warrant.
Akbar Malik.
Come.
Sit.
Switch on the light.
You must be familiar with this.
No?
Let me explain it to you.
How many fingers are
there in the right hand?
Five.
And in the left hand?
Five.
What's your name?
What's your real name?
What's your name?
Akbar Malik.
You first met Shraddha Sharma in India.
No.
You are an Indian agent.
No.
You are in contact with Delhi.
No.
Your family is in Delhi.
No.
Grandma, a peacock took your peahen
No, sir.
Nothing yet.
He will spill everything.
Just give me some time.
You can't use third degree torture.
You know the situation.
Sir.
-I am confident that--
-Khan!
It's very important to
wait for the right time.
When we speak the truth,
our body reacts differently.
And when we lie, our body
reacts in a different manner.
When we lie,
the body's stress level rises.
That helps them detect the lie.
There is a way to crack
the polygraph test.
How many fingers are
there in the right hand?
Five.
The stress level increases with pain.
There won't be much difference
between the truth and the lie.
Sir, leave the wounds open.
They will heal faster.
Colonel Khan is not going to stop.
But Joker is a bigger threat for you.
He knows that you have got the
unwanted attention of the ISI.
I will make a call to Delhi.
How will that help?
Do you think they will risk the
entire network for a single pawn?
At this point,
you have just one resource.
Isaq Afridi.
This Pathan will not let
anything happen to his child.
Nothing at all.
Akbar is a loyal citizen who
risked his life to save others.
He has been tortured a lot.
And who did it?
General.
I am ashamed to tell you that
my son, Nawab, is responsible for this.
And for this impious quest...
he has teamed up with General Ghazi.
-Purpose?
-Akbar is my right-hand man.
And they...
hate our cordial relationship.
-Ghazi, this--
-Assalamu alaikum, sir.
Since when you conduct
top-level surveillance
on Pakistani citizens without any reason?
-And that too without my permission.
-No, sir.
Never without your permission.
Then with whose permission did
you treat Akbar Malik so harshly?
Sir...
I apologize but I do not
know anything about this.
Conduct an inquiry immediately.
Give me a report by tomorrow morning.
Yes, sir.
-Send Colonel Khan immediately.
-Yes, sir.
Akbar, you have turned the
situation in your favor.
Isaq Afridi treats me like his son.
And I…
Mister!
Get this straight.
You are not Akbar Malik but Romeo Ali.
That's right.
God forbid,
if you get emotionally involved,
you will be in trouble.
Why is everybody running helter-skelter?
Sir, haven't you heard the news?
This is a very sad news.
Today, at two in the afternoon,
Chief of Pakistan Army,
General Jahangir died in a bomb blast.
Isaq Afridi, his close aide,
was killed in the blast as well.
It is believed that this terror attack
was carried out by Akbar Malik.
He is known to have
connections with India.
Akbar Malik is now trapped.
Adil.
-Sir.
-Go get him.
Out! Out!
He's not here, sir.
I think he has escaped.
What?
That's impossible!
Bastard!
Akbar Malik!
Bloody scoundrel!
ISI chief,
Lieutenant General Ghazi Ali Hayat
has been appointed as
Chief of the Pakistan Army.
After taking over command,
he issued orders to capture
Akbar Malik alive at any cost.
Mr. Akbar, what are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.
Before anybody learns that you are here...
you should...
cross the border and go back to India.
All the roads leading out are blocked.
It's almost impossible
to cross the border.
Okay.
Have a seat.
I'll get some tea for you.
This is for your safety.
God forbid that you
ever need to use this.
God forbid,
if you get emotionally involved,
you will be in trouble.
Akbar Malik.
Sir, your trunk call is connected.
Did you confirm it?
Sir, a trunk call has been booked
from Begumpet bus depot for Delhi.
It's for Chief of RAW.
Catch this.
As soon as the call gets over send
its transcription to Colonel Khan.
Yes, sir.
Akbar.
Are you surprised to hear my voice?
I am happy to hear your voice.
Really? What about yesterday?
Was that your way of expressing happiness?
It wasn't my decision.
It was a call hastily
taken by somebody else.
Anyway, it's futile talking
about what happened yesterday.
What matters is the present...
and the future of the country.
What about me?
What about the one
who was doing everything for the country?
Akbar, a storm can hit a riverbank
settlement at any moment.
When a storm peaks...
people need to leave their work,
house and everything else behind.
They have to empty the whole place.
What are you trying to say?
You are stuck in a storm
and are useless for me.
In fact, now that I look at it...
you are not one of my own anymore.
You are like a Pakistani for me.
Like a Joker in a pack of cards.
In these circumstances, you are
a liability for me.
I have done my job.
You will have to do yours.
When will you be back from your training?
Mom, it's difficult to say.
It's the nature of the job.
You cover my head
When the sun beats down
You cry with me when I am hurt
If I remove my amulet
You start worrying
Keep away the evil eye
Is what you tell me with love
Oh, Mom
I think about you all the time
Oh, Mom
I think about you all the time
Oh, Mom
I think about you all the time
-Shraddha Sharma?
-Yes.
Come with us.
Ahmed Salahuddin...
was the imam of Bulandshah Masjid
and the India's network head.
Joker's death is also the
end of the Indian spy network.
What do you think?
Just because you shared some
details we shall embrace you.
No, sir.
I just want an opportunity to
be considered one of your own.
Just one chance to tell India that...
the way they treated this Indian Muslim,
they dare not do it with any other
Akbar Malik alias Romeo Ali.
What are you trying to say?
I want to carry out Operation Badlipur.
Are you in your senses?
Do you have any idea of the
significance of this operation?
Very well.
I am requesting you because this
is a critical operation.
Only I have complete knowledge
of this mission.
-And the late Isaq Afridi--
-I will give you a chance.
-Sir.
-Go.
Prepare for the mission.
We don't have much time.
Thank you, sir.
Sir, until yesterday
he was a RAW agent.
Which is why even after
all that he's done...
he still has to pass this test.
-But, it's still a big risk.
-You will be on that plane as well.
If he misses, you will not miss
and you will complete the mission.
Yes, sir.
Our spy network has
almost been wiped out.
Also, the head of your spy network.
Shraddha?
On the third of December in 1971...
Pakistan Air Force bombed
Pathankot Airbase at 05:40 p.m.
Right after that,
ten Indian airbases were bombed.
India was well-prepared
for these attacks...
and promptly launched
a counter attack on Pakistan.
On that very evening,
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
addressed the entire nation.
She said that India and Pakistan
are at war.
On December 16, 1971
the Pakistan Army accepted defeat.
Pakistan signed the
instrument of surrender in Dhaka.
Thus, a new country was born
in the Indian subcontinent.
Bangladesh.
Only three days left for
Pakistan's President General Ghazi
and Foreign Minister Nawab Afridi
to arrive in Nepal.
To inspect the security arrangements...
a delegation has landed
from Pakistan to Nepal.
In other news, Prakash Padukone has won
Kuala Lumpur Championship...
Chief, how does following
all this benefit you?
It's been ten years.
You are now on the verge of retirement.
It's not about benefits.
It's about habits.
It's easy to retire from a position...
but tough to retire
from your way of thinking.
What is the hurry, gentlemen?
Walter Khan.
I have gotten rid of everything
that you have given me.
You said that there would
be no security lapses.
But, our country's special
friends are very much here.
Sir, they are from the South Asia--
I am indebted to you.
Well...
I got an opportunity to thank you today.
For making an ordinary man
really special.
For showing my acquaintances
how pathetic they are.
Thank you for making me understand
the real meaning of life.
Thankfully, you stopped there.
Or else, I would have learnt too much.
How are your instincts faring?
Just a few days to go
before you take charge.
There has been no official announcement.
And only a few people know
about this in the department.
How does he know this?
A great magician once said that...
People focus on your left hand
but your right hand does the trick.
In the same way, my right hand...
was silently doing the trick.
In the next 12 hours,
heavy rains and a storm are expected.
It is expected that the whole village
may be drowned.
The weather department has ordered an
immediate evacuation of Badlipur.
Leave alone drowning,
there were no chances of rain.
That's why you wanted to keep
everything low profile.
Until November 17,
225 square kilometer around Badlipur
was under the control of Mukti Bahini.
That means under our control.
We just shifted people from
one location to the other.
In a card game,
Joker is the only card...
with deceptive looks and actions.
The real story of today's meeting.
Until today, only Madam
and I knew this.
Now, the next Chief of RAW
knows this as well.
Do you remember that incident...
when Akbar called me
from an unsecured landline?
I was trying to communicate
through my gestures.
Akbar, a storm can hit a riverbank
settlement at any moment.
When a storm peaks...
people need to leave their work,
house and everything else behind.
They have to empty the whole place.
What are you trying to say?
You are like a Pakistani for me.
Like a Joker in a pack of cards.
If I say your tea is cold,
then I'm actually trying to tell
you that you don't need to drink it.
You will never be spoken to
in a straight forward manner.
You will have to interpret the truth...
and understand it.
You are like a Pakistani for me.
Like a Joker in a pack of cards.
A storm can hit a riverbank
settlement at any moment.
You need to leave everything behind.
They have to empty the whole place.
The Badlipur plan.
Him becoming a Pakistani.
Taking charge of Operation Badlipur.
You were responsible for everything.
He did get my hint.
But he paved his own path.
In the war of 1971,
we received information...
about the attacks on
Indian air bases from...
In the last ten years, India has
managed to stay a step ahead of Pakistan.
Romeo Akbar Walter.
He won their trust with
the Badlipur blast...
and never looked back.
He lost his real identity and family.
He wasn't even able to attend
the funeral of his mother.
Oh, Mom
Oh, Mom
Oh, Mom
There are some people
we know nothing about.
These people selflessly sacrifice
everything for their motherland.
Knowing that, at the end of their journey,
they will neither get fame nor respect.
Sometimes, they are not
even cremated or buried
in their own motherland.
This story salutes those brave Indians.
Jai Hind!
