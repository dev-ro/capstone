I cry from happiness.
Forgive me, my love.
Grandma, Grandma, 
what a big mouth you have!
Lower your hands!
Never take your eyes off the bull
Close your eyes!
That night, Little Carmen ate dinner
with Encarna for the first time.
Do you like chicken
in PEPEtoria sauce?

If you disobey me again, 
you know who'll be next!
SMILE!!

The next day, the stepmother sent
Carmen to put flowers on her 
father's grave. Far, far away...
 At dusk...

She's going to cause problems.
Besides, she's in my bed...
AND OURS!
We can't just leave her like this...
She's only a child!
Who are you?

You'll see, she'll bring us problems!
WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING?!
People love this!
Where did you learn to bullfight?
I don't know...
Would you like to stay on with us?
Can you still not 
remember your name?
We'll call you Snow White,
like the story.
I don't know how to read.
I'm Carlos Montoya,
bullfighting agent.

This is just a formality.

on the first aniversary of his death?
The mourning goes on inside.
Allow me to present Genaro Bilbao,
my decorator.
