The Replacement Killers
{\i1}Extended Cut{\i0}
{\i1}Can you see him?{\i0}
{\i1}Copy that.{\i0}
{\i1}He's headed your way.{\i0}
{\i1}He's on the move{\i0}
{\i1}so let's be on standby.{\i0}
All right let's roll.
Hold your fire!
Everybody hold back out there.
Let him run. He ain't going anywhere.
Back away!
Get it out of here! Go on get it out!
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Put that gun down.
Put it down.
Don't make me.
It's inappropriate for a murderer
to come to his victim's burial.
Just here to pay my respects.
Respect?
For the blood of my child?
My orphaned grandson?
Your son made his choice.
And you made your choice
detective.
The day you chose to pursue
a vendetta against me.
Against my family.
Your position offers more opportunity
for arrogance than safety.
Don't open it. Mr. Wei needs
to see you personally
My son is dead.
My condolences.
A child is irreplaceable.
Which brings us to your task.
It involves a cop.
That's why we want an outsider.
After that
your obligation to me ends.
Dad come on.
I went against Mr. Wei today.
There will be consequences.
What do you want me to do?
I'm worried about my mother and sister
I would like to you take them
from Shanghai to someplace safe.
Here is some money.
Help me send it to them.
John...
...we are talking about Terence Wei.
Safe has a very limited meaning.
There's been a problem.
Why ain't this car done?
I gotta get it on the boat tomorrow.
Nobody leaves until
this car is done you hear me?
And get rid of the VIN numbers. I
don't wanna get caught for that again.
All right you guys get back to work.
It's for me.
How the hell do you guys get phones?
I don't pay you enough for that.
What do you want?
Eddie it's John.
What happened?
The piece wasn't there?
It was there.
I need a passport can you help?
Yeah I'll just call Bob.
No he works for Mr. Wei.
Everybody works for Wei.
What do you want?
{\i1}I want someone who doesn't.{\i0}
I know this broad.
I don't use her much because
she's a pain in the ass.
- Her name's Meg Coburn.
- Coburn?
{\i1}She's in the Olive Building.{\i0}
- Where you gonna be in the morning?
- It's best if you don't know.
All right Johnny.
Watch your back huh?
Yeah?
Meg Coburn?
Never heard of her.
Eddie.
Eddie sent me.
Great.
Hang on a second.
All right come on in.
Can I help you?
I need a package.
- What's a package?
- Papers you know?
I don't know. I'm slow that way.
You'll need to be specific.
I want forged documents to China.
Okay. You said "forged."
We'll do it.
Now have a seat.
Or not.
- I don't have much time.
- As you will.
China? Mainland?
All right. You're gonna need a visa
a birth certificate a driver's license...
...and a passport.
To make coming and going easier...
...we make you an American citizen.
What you need is gonna cost you.
No problem.
The only way money isn't a problem
is if I see it upfront.
Because I don't like hassling with
assholes you know what I'm saying?
How soon did you say
you needed this?
From here I go to the airport.
One hour.
That soon?
All right back up.
You have to back up
because I'm taking your picture.
Smile and say
"Flight from prosecution."
What's your name?
John.
And?
John Lee.
Thank you.
You sure? Aren't there like a billion
John Lees in China?
Yeah all right. John Lee it is.
I can fix that.
Yeah?
Meg Coburn?
Never heard of her.
This way!
All right hold it right there!
He's still out there.
He won't get to China.
We shouldn't be chasing
our problems Mr. Kogan.
We should be solving them.
How would you like this handled?
Bring in professionals.
Men of John's talent.
- Coffee no sugar okay?
- Nope no sugar.
A ham sandwich would be better.
I mean I've been sitting here
for 12 fucking hours.
All right. Let's see...
...what Meg Coburn's all about
shall we?
Swindle bad checks mail fraud
no heavy felonies here.
But you make up for that in volume:
12 arrests before you were 16.
It's odd for a girl that age
to be in so much trouble.
I've always considered myself
a feminist pioneer.
You've been clean here
for about four and a half years.
You either got smart
or you've been...
...lucky.
- Is there a third choice?
It doesn't matter.
Your good luck ran out today.
Now let's talk about your office
and four dead bodies.
I'll bite. Where did they come from?
You didn't kill them did you?
You think a lightweight
like me did all that?
- Who's that?
- It looks like a ghost.
Come on Meg you can
do better than that.
It was in your computer.
You're a bright girl in a bad place.
- I can help you.
- Yeah.
I can't seem to remember
one single bad place...
...a cop helped me out of.
Is that so? Well...
...somebody helped when
you were 14. Custodial placement.
But you don't remember that.
Fuck you.
- You know nothing about me.
- I know everything.
It's all here in black and white.
Read it.
It's your life
nobody screwed it up but yourself.
- You're looking at two years.
- Minimum.
If you really were smart you wouldn't
mess around with Terence Wei.
- Terence Wei?
- That's right Terence Wei.
Where do you think those
dead bodies in your office came from?
I have never dealt with
Terence Wei in my life.
Well you have now okay?
Okay this is the part
where I talk to an attorney.
You're not under arrest.
You have no right to an attorney.
It also means
I can walk out the fucking door.
Sure but I tell you what...
...somebody on the other side
wants you dead.
- I'm real scared. See me shaking?
- I sure as hell do.
I've got a deal for you.
You tell me about this guy
and I can make it all go away.
Put you under police protection.
I honestly don't know anything.
But even if I did
I wouldn't give it to you.
Suit yourself.
Last chance to arrest me
Detective Zedkov.
I didn't think so.
Oh by the way tell whoever
you're gonna put on my tail...
...that I'm gonna lose them
on 6th Street.
Put Morris and Duke on her.
- Why not charge her?
- She's red meat.
I'll put her on a hook
and see what the dogs do.
Shit!
Jesus Christ!
What the hell are you doing here?
I still need papers.
Yeah great.
You expect me to cook
a passport with crayons?
Take a look around.
Anything not shot up the cops took.
My $3000 computer
is now a paperweight.
Four years of work down the drain
because you picked my door.
- We go to Eddie.
- Why?
For help.
I'm not going with you.
You're a walking bull's-eye.
So are you. You're safer with me.
Is it my perfume?
You're the second guy today
who thinks I'd accept help. I won't.
It's not an option.
What happens when I tell you
to go fuck yourself?
Okay.
If that's how you wanna play it.
But when the gun's in my hand
we'll talk again.
Okay Nick what do you got for me?
How about it?
- My kid works faster.
- I'm trying there's not much there.
Okay I think I got it.
There's your ghost.
Good stuff come on.
Hey!
Next time kidnap someone
with a Bentley.
So how'd you piss off Terence Wei?
Cops told me.
- What did you say?
- I didn't say nothing.
What you think I'm an idiot?
I know you got me mixed up in
some Chinatown gangster bullshit.
Less I know better.
Buckle up.
Eddie?
Let's go.
Eddie?
Oh shit.
Eddie.
You two make a cute couple.
You're welcome to try.
Take his gun.
Check them.
I beat my head against the wall
trying to anticipate your next move.
I beat Eddie's head
against the wall...
...trying to anticipate
your next move.
Mr. Wei will be pleased
we found you.
Okay.
This has nothing to do with me.
I'll just walk out
and pretend I saw nothing.
I'm sorry Meg but you're in
a little too deep.
- You picked the wrong partner.
- Partner?
No wait.
I'm his hostage.
I just met this guy yesterday.
He told me his name was John Lee.
His name is John Lee.
You know what happens to hostages.
They tend to get killed.
Cuff him.
Cuff them both.
Shit!
How's that leg?
How's yours?
Bring the car around.
Flush him out!
Oh fuck!
I wondered if you
were coming back.
- Get down!
- Oh shit!
Get in!
Keys! Take the keys!
Give me a gun!
Get this car moving!
Come on!
Move the car! Go!
Put the gun down!
Oh shit!
Another problem Mr. Kogan.
- John was lucky. It won't last.
- Don't confuse luck with skill.
I served with John's father
in China.
He was an honorable man.
But he could be ruthless.
John is like him.
- Where are John's replacements?
- Arriving as we speak.
It's gonna hurt.
Just do it.
I told you we'd have
this conversation again.
You son of a bitch.
What did you get me into
with Terence Wei?
He's my patron.
Patron?
He made it possible
for me to come here.
What does he sponsor you
to play the violin?
In exchange for...
...services.
What a nice way of saying
you kill people.
Did you think you could
fuck Terence Wei?
Did you think you could
fuck Terence Wei?!
And now his foot soldiers are
all over the streets looking for you.
And for me.
Put your gun down.
Now would you let me walk
out that door?
I didn't think so.
You're not leaving me with a whole
hell of a lot of options are you?
Do it.
Do it.
Shoot me! Do it! Do it!
Do it right now! I'll do it for you.
I'm sorry.
Then tell me what the fuck
is going on!
Our situation in China is difficult.
I was born a soldier.
I've seen people die.
All I ever wanted...
...was for my family to be safe.
I would do anything
to protect them.
Anything.
Mr. Wei used my mother
and sister...
...to persuade me to do three jobs.
The first two were criminals.
It wasn't difficult.
And the third?
I couldn't do it.
If I don't get back to China...
...my family will die.
You picked a very bad day
to grow such a selective conscience.
But they chose me.
{\i1}Hello?{\i0}
It's me. What about my family?
{\i1}I can't find them.{\i0}
{\i1}Wei's people also sniff out.{\i0}
I need passport.
{\i1}You can use my.{\i0}
Thanks.
What was that all about?
I have a passport.
Fix it for me.
Then you can go.
My family is running out of time.
I'll need a picture.
This time it's two jobs.
But it's the two of you.
John is more trouble
than we thought.
So what's the time frame?
Immediate.
So I'm just curious...
...what made you assume
I could jack a car?
Lucky guess.
Your mother or your father?
{\i1}Mechanics Illustrated.{\i0}
My father taught me how to shoot.
Playing catch is so impersonal.
He was a general.
A very important man.
Was?
What happened?
He was re-educated
in the cultural revolution.
What does that mean?
Anyone who disagreed with
Chairman Mao was made loyal.
Families were punished.
Many were beaten
tortured shamed.
And how did a general
get re-educated?
By his son.
When I got older...
...I promised...
...I would get my mother
and sister out of China.
What do you mean
that's all you got?
Give me the money.
Get the fuck out of here!
What's up Meg?
- You look good!
- Not today Loco.
What's with the attitude?
You need to spend time with me.
Get some of this love.
Meet my new friend.
What's up "friend"?
Ain't no harm.
No harm right?
Old boyfriend?
I stick to my own species.
Here we are.
Fastest passport photos in town.
Now give me three bucks.
Hostage etiquette.
Kidnappers pay for incidentals.
Thank you very much.
You gave me four.
I'll take it as a tip.
Sit still and stare
straight ahead.
You could have saved yourself
trouble by doing that third job.
It was wrong.
Mr. Wei was taking revenge.
A man named Zedkov
killed his son.
Zedkov?
You're getting yourself killed
for a cop?
Not a cop.
His son.
What?
A seven-year-old boy.
Why?
That is how Mr. Wei deals
with his enemies.
Through the families.
You're done.
Get out of there.
Picture's not done yet.
We'll have to wait
a few minutes.
Don't turn around.
Cops?
No.
Assassins.
Stay close to me okay?
Now!
Let's go!
John!
Hello?
Hey champ.
How you doing?
Dad!
- What are you up to?
{\i1}- Making a shake.{\i0}
Listen to this.
{\i1}Stevie let me talk to your...{\i0}
Two officers down in a shootout.
Gotta move now.
Stevie! Stevie!
Stop it would you?
Daddy's gotta go work now.
Are you canceling tonight?
{\i1}I wouldn't.{\i0}
{\i1}- You promised we'd go to the movies.{\i0}
{\i1}- We are.{\i0}
{\i1}I'm gonna take you to see{\i0}
{\i1}the cartoon...{\i0}
That kid turns that blender on
one more time...
...l'm gonna shoot him myself.
Then I would have to kill you.
Wei specifically wants the kid's brains
dumped in Daddy's lap my friend.
Alan.
Alan!
Alan!
I moved your family to Canton.
But I told Wei's men they'll be in Shanghai.
How long do I have?
Wei will find them by tomorrow night.
Go get them first.
I'm sorry Alan.
How will you get to the airport
with those two killers after you?
They won't be.
They're here to finish my job.
Zedkov's boy must die in his arms.
Then he will share Mr. Wei's pain.
Zeedo's son for your family. Wow.
It's a hell of a choice.
People die.
Children die.
People die.
Children die.
The same thing happens to your
family if you don't get there first.
When I was a kid my mom
was kind of a weak woman.
She couldn't make her own money
so we always had boyfriends...
...in and out of the house.
The one that stuck was Lester.
He used to beat on her.
And when I would stand up for her...
...he would belt me in the mouth.
So...
...I learned to shut up.
Then I hit 14...
...and I was passing for 21
in all the local bars.
And old Lester started getting
real friendly with me.
So that was it.
I was out of there clean. Only I...
...left a 10-year-old brother behind.
Named Joseph.
I... I... I thought he would be okay
you know...
...because he was a boy...
...and I didn't think Lester
would touch him.
And one night Lester just...
...put Joey's head
through the kitchen wall.
People die.
Children die.
I've spent whole days
thinking about that one thing.
That one good deed that'll
wipe out all the shit I've done.
You ever feel like that?
You didn't want to shoot a kid.
Welcome to the human race.
Standing aside is no different
from pulling the trigger.
Here.
Now that's some of my best work.
Have a nice trip.
I'll need guns.
What the fuck?!
- You picked the wrong place.
- Oh yeah?
Why don't we see if the jury
will stand up for a rat?
What's the story Loco?
Should I dump on him?
No no no.
No don't trip.
- I got it all under control.
- That's good.
Now get up. Get up!
Keep the dice warm.
Righteous these are my people.
It ain't what you're thinking.
You're marked with
every drug dealer.
If I'd been seen with you
and hadn't called...
I'd cause myself unnecessary drama.
We wouldn't want that
now would we?
Break out the munitions.
That.45 is all I got.
You sure about that?
I forgot about that one.
You can have that. That's on me.
Your keys.
Say what? No no.
You're tripping.
You stand by your product?
You're gonna bust me a cap
right here?
Can you make that louder?
There ain't nothing in there.
You got both my straps.
Thank for the ride Loc.
How am I supposed to get home?
You've seen our car.
Twist the red and the yellow wires.
The time and the place.
The boy is at the beginning
of his life.

Zedkov get your kid down!
Go!
Hold on! Hold on Stevie!
We'll be okay!
Get him out! I'll cover you.
Okay okay!
Go!
Run! Run!
It's my boy.
They went after my kid.
Listen to me.
We're gonna lock down this city.
It's not them.
Coburn and her pal
saved my ass tonight.
What?
They saved my son.
Come here boy.
- How you doing? You still scared?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah me too.
Come on.
You sit here in the car.
Come here.
- Guess what?
- What?
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- Hey!
- You got the keys?
Have them take him to his mother's.
Put them under guard.
Pick somebody good.
I want them safe.
Should we tell her what's going on?
- Tell her what you want.
- What are you doing?
John?
Call Zedkov.
He knows now.
You'll be safe.
Safe?
What about you?
My family is not protected.
So what are you gonna do?
Kill all of Chinatown
just to get to Wei?
I cannot run from battle.
From what I am.
There's a difference between
battle and suicide.
It would be
the last death I cause.
Fair enough.
Okay John. Let's go.
You saved the boy.
This is not your fight.
I know.
But I've developed a problem
with watching you die.
I have the same problem with you.
I believe he'll come here next.
So will Zedkov.
We shouldn't wait
for either of them.
Of course not.
Call the airport
then our men in Shanghai.
You'll handle his mother and
sister before John gets to them.
And me?
Stay here.
Earn what you were paid for.
Hey hey hey!
Meg.
I'm gonna find you.
But you could save me time...
...and put a bullet in your head.
If the position were reversed...
...l'd do the same for you.
Are you?
Excuse me?
Gonna put a bullet in your head
since our positions are reversed?
Meg it doesn't...
I didn't think so.
Checkmate.
The boy will die John...
...as well as your family.
Not in your lifetime.
John?
Zeedo! Zeedo!
What's going on man?
They're gone.
INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS
Hey.
Hi.
I brought you a
going-away present.
For your family.
Thank you.
I've never made one for someone
I didn't want to see leave.
This was a lot easier when
they were shooting at us.
I will miss you.
