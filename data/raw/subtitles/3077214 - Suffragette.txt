London
Women do not have the calmness of temperament or
the balance of mind to exercise judgement in political affairs.
If we allow women to vote, it will mean the loss of social structure.
Women are well represented by their fathers, brothers, husbands.
Here here.
Once the vote was given, it would be impossible to stop at this.
Women would then demand the right of becoming MPs,
cabinet ministers, judges.
Here here.
<b>For decades women had peacefully campaigned
for equality and the right to vote.
<b>Their arguments were ignored.
<b>In response, Emmeline Pankhurst,
leader of the Suffragette movent,
<b>called for a national campaign
of civil disobedience.
<b>This is the stoey of one group
of working women who joined the fight.
<b>SUFFRAGETTE
Maud - take this up to the West End.
It's meant to be there by six.
Delivery should have picked it up.
VOTES FOR WOMEN!
VOTES FOR WOMEN!
VOTES FOR WOMEN!
VICTORY WILL BE OURS.
VOTES FOR WOMEN!
_

VOTES FOR WOMEN!
Is George sleeping?
Yeah. Mrs Garston fed him bread and jam.
Are you all right?
It's late.
Taylor sent me up to town.
Let me have a look.
It's nothing...
I got caught in a scuffle.
There were a load of those women shouting...
Broke all the windows along the West End.
Ill deliver that package for you in the morning.
Ta.
- You coming to bed?
- Im just going to get this done.
Arms up.
_
_
_
_
All right, dear?
Ta, Mrs Garston.
Oh, come here.
Be good.
_
_
Oi Mrs Miller!
Mrs Miller.
- Dont you ignore me.
- Sorry Mr Taylor.
Late again?
Oh Im barely late its only just gone the hour.
Shut your mouth.
You listen to me.
Thats the second time youve been late and youve only been here three weeks,
- I aint been late...
- Dont answer me back Mrs Miller. Im telling you.
Sorry.
Do you want me to dismiss you, is that it?
No, no Mr Taylor.
No, sir I dont. And I wont be late tomorrow nor the day after that, I swear.
Well you pull your finger out.
Drive belts loose again.
It was checked Friday.
You can smell burning.
Id check em all.
Bert!
Get your toolbox.
Check the drive belt on the machine.
Will do boss.
Ta.
We meet Monday and Thursday if youre interested.
The Ellyns pharmacy.
Here Maud.
That package get to Buckleys yesterday?
George had his chest again.
Sonny took it up for me this morning.
You ready?
This is my eldest,
Maggie.
Hello Maggie.
It is men who have all legal rights over our children.
It is men who control our economic existence.
Whos that?
It is men who hold the deeds to our property.
MPs wife, Mrs Haughton.
She's here at Christmas giving out tangerines to the children.
and the Prime Minister, Mr Asquith,
has agreed to a hearing of testimonies of working women up and down the country.
We have an opportunity to demonstrate that as women are equal to men in their labours,
so they should be equal to men in their right to vote.
Youve never laboured in your life.
This is your moment to come forward and speak up.
I will choose one person from this laundry
to deliver their testimony at the House of Commons.
These will be heard by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Lloyd George.
No one cares, love.
Some of us do, Mrs Coleman,
so shut your bleedin' cake hole.
Here here.
Thank you for your support.
Votes for women!
Ladies, votes for women.
The power is in your hands.
- Thank you ladies.
- Oh go home.
Votes for women. Thank you.
Mommy!
Hello kids. Give me half a mo.
Are you gonna give your testimony then?
Mr Taylors a good employer.
To you he is.
- Take that back.
- I cant take back what I see.
Youve been here less than a month.
And?
Ive been doing laundry work ever since I was thirteen.
Maggie's only twelve and she's in here already.
Its as tough for us women as its ever been.
Weve got to do whatever we can. However we can.
What like smashing windows?
Its not respectable.
Strangle whats respectable.
You want me to respect the law,
then make the law respectable.
So Georgie, Georgie! This is six.
You ready? You watching?
You got yours?
You see Mrs Haughton today?
Wants some of the women to go to Parliament.
She thinks we should be paid more.
On her high horse again.
Say goodnight to the King, George.
Good night, Sir.
Good boy.
Come on.
_
Can you give me big breath in, please.
Good boy.
And out.
And now another big one please.
And big breath out. Good boy.
And big breath in.
Ah yes. Here comes the eleven oclock just passing through the tunnel.
Good - its on time.
Hes alright.
(Good boy.)
You a suffragette, Mrs Ellyn?
Yes. But
I consider myself more of a soldier, Mrs Watts.
These womens testimonies make a difference?
Maybe but as Mrs Pankhurst says,
its deeds, not words, that will get us the vote.
Make up a combination.
Now George, do you like barley sugar?
Afternoon.
Are the others here yet?
No, not yet, but you can go through.
Plenty of steam
with a couple of drops in the water,
twice daily.
Keep him warm.
No, no. No charge.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.
- Thank you Mr Ellyn.
- Mrs Watts.
Come on, lets get you wrapped up.
Superintendent Burrill.
Mr Haughton. Thank you for coming here. This is-
Inspector Steed. Benedict Haughton, Home Office.
I am reliably informed that you have considerable experience of counter surveillance within the Special Branch-
Ive gathered intelligence on various anarchists, sir,
including Fenian agitators in Liverpool and Manchester.
I can show you.
Employment of these cameras would be the first of its kind in this country.
Theyre considerably more advanced than anything weve used before.
Compact enough to be used without a tripod,
it means we can operate them covertly on the streets.
Right.
Lets start with Mrs Edith Ellyn.
Chief commandant. Shes clever.
Been arrested nine times, incarcerated four.
Shes educated, without scruples. Makes her particularly dangerous.
Its worth noting her husband,
Mr Hugh Ellyn, pharmacist.
Hes been incarcerated twice for abetting his wifes activities.
Fully paid up member of the Mens League.
This is an old hand. Mrs Violet Miller. She moves around a lot.
Been arrested a number of times, incarcerated twice.
Spits out children.
Husbands a violent drunk.
She agitates, gets her hands dirty.
Theyll be using her zeal to recruit-
to justify the unjustifiable.
Now,
whos this here?
Watts.
Maud Watts.
Not seen her before.
Theres a good girl. Come on.
No! Get off.
Itll be alright. Itll be alright.
Get off.
You know what I like.
Get back to work. Go on, get out there.
What did you want Maud?
Fourteen short on soap paddles.
Why dont you tell acquisitions if were short?
Right?
I dont want a slip up like that to happen again, do you hear?
She reminds me of you at that age.
Oi, Mrs Miller
I hear youve been chosen to deliver your testimony to Mr Lloyd George?
Tomorrow.
Leave the vote to us, eh Mrs Miller
and well leave you to the home.
Ive already made up the hours. Worked late Tuesday and Thursday.
And Maggie will mop up any extra.
Why dont you tell Mr Miller
Ill give you a clip round the ear and knock some sense into you if he wont.
Yeah, me an all. Do er some good, eh?
Violet.
Ill come with you tomorrow.
Hear you speak.
Maud.
What you doing?
Im just going to listen.
Violet!
Where were you? We waited and-
Violet.
Its nothing. Im all right.
Mrs Haughtons inside.
Well come on then.
(Mrs Miller is unfortunately...)
_
Mrs Miller-
Oh, my dear-
Glass House Laundry next.
Sheffield Weavers Union please be ready. Youre straight after.
You cannot deliver your testimony like this.
Deputations will be heard one by one.
Im fine.
No, Mrs Miller, youre not.
Lloyd George will dismiss you and all you say.
Glass House Laundry.
Maud,
you speak for me.
I cant.
It is written down.
No, I'm not. I'm not good at...
- All you'd have to do is read it.
- Please ask someone else. I'm...
There'll be someone else who can do it better than I can. Please-
- You can tell 'em. You can tell em. Maud, please.
- Glasshouse Laundry please
Please, we have no time.
You can do it.
You tell em.
(Come on.)
Good luck Maud.
Shall you begin Mrs Miller-
...Watts.
Its Mrs Watts, Sir.
Mrs Miller isnt able to.
I have her testimony-
You work at the Glasshouse Laundry in Bethnal Green too?
I was born there.
Then I should like to hear your testimony.
I dont know what to say.
Your mother worked at the laundry?
From when she was fourteen.
Shed strap me on her back or under the copper vats if Id sleep.
All the women did it who had babies then.
Your employer allowed that?
Hed have you back as soon as you could.
He?
Mr Taylor.
And does your mother still work at the laundry?
She died when I was four.
I see.
Vat tipped, scalded her.
What of your father?
Dont know him.
And you worked for Mr Taylor-
...part time from when I was seven,
full time from when I was twelve.
Dont need much schooling to launder shirts.
I was good at collars,
steaming the fine lacing. Got the hands for it.
I was made head washer at seventeen.
Forewoman at twenty.
Twenty four now so-
Youre young to have such a position.
Laundry works a short life if youre a woman.
And why is that?
You get your aches and your chest cough,
crushed fingers.
Leg ulcers, burns,
headaches from the gas.
We had one girl last year poisoned.
Cant work again. Ruined her lungs.
And your pay?
We get thirteen shillings a week, sir.
For a man its nineteen
and we work a third more the hours.
Theyre outside most days on deliveries so at least theyre in the fresh air.
What would the vote mean to you, Mrs Watts?
I never thought wed get the vote
so Ive never thought about what it would mean.
So why are you here?
The thought that we might...
That this life...
that there is another way of living this life-
Sorry. My words... Im not...
No..No...
The finest eloquence
is that which gets things done.
Thank you, Mrs Watts.
I believe we have that all down.
We will have a response for you very soon.
An amendment to the bill might just force the change
towards the vote.
Thank you, sir.
(Now, we please have...?? Union)
Youve been drinking.
Just a brandy.
Mrs Haughton treated us.
Mrs Haughton can afford it.
I spoke, Sonny.
I thought you was just gonna listen.
Violet couldnt so they asked me.
I was just going to say what she would have said but then
he asked me if I worked in the laundry as well
and I just started talking.
To Mr Lloyd George.
- If we got the vote-
- What would you do with it Maud?
Do the same you do with yours, Sonny.
Exercise my rights.
Exercise your rights?
You a suffragette now,
one of those Panks?
No-
Mrs Miller is.
You know how they like to talk.
You spend your time with her, thats what theyll call you.
Im only looking out for you, Maud.
I know.
Its all Ive ever done-
Oi Maud,
Violet.
Mrs Ellyns invited you to tea.
- Has she?
- Yeah.
She says youve gone and woken up the dinosaurs of Westminster.
Where are Mr Ellyns certificates?
Oh he hasnt any.
(He has me.)
His father passed the business to him.
But he never took to chemistry.
I actually wanted to become a doctor.
My father didnt approve.
Im still good at diagnosis.
So you married-?
23 years now.
I had hoped that one day it might
have read Ellyn and daughters.
One must look to the next generation.
I hear you spoke well.
I was thinking we could take him to the seaside in the summer.
Dont go drinking champagne on beer money, Maud.
Arms up!
We could take him to the pictures Friday.
_
_
Oi, Mrs Miller, bet you wish you were a man.
Bet you wish you were too.
Saucy cow!
Wish us luck.
Luckd be youd stop this now, go to work.
Go on.
_
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Here you are Maud.
You gotta look the part aint ya?
(SUFFRAGETTES SINGING March Of The Women)
Shout, shout, up with your song!
Cry with the wind for the dawn is breaking;
March, march, swing you along,
Wide blows our banner and hope is waking.
- Can you see anything?
- They havent opened the doors yet.
Is that him?
The Prime Minister
duly reviewed all the womens testimonies.
After careful debate
with a number of MPs very sympathetic
to the womens cause,
it was carried
that there was not the evidence
to support any change to the Suffrage Bill.
What?
No votes for women then, Sir?
No, no votes.
But Mr Lloyd George listened. He took it all down.
Sham. Sham!
Liar..Liar..
Liar..
Liar..Liar..
Liar..Liar..
Liar..
Come on now, youve had your fun.
Get back.
(Move back now, come on!)
_
_
_
Hey! Leave her alone!
Unhand me!
Get off me... Get off me...
_
- How much is bail?
- Two pounds, sir.
No, Benedict,
you must bail all the women. I cannot be the only one to go free.
Benedict please-
I will not.
How much is the sum?
Two pounds, each.
Twelve pounds to release all the women.
Please sign it.
Its my money. My money.
But youre my wife.
And youll act like a wife.
I have humoured you Alice, thus far but...
this is an outrage.
Thank you.
Come on.
I have to fetch my son by six.
Im late. Hell need his tea.
You wont be home for tea.
Would you like me to contact your husband, Mrs Watts?
- I picked up a suffragette last week-
- Im not a suffragette.
Rough little diamond.
In her bloomers?
Three bricks.
Works for Mrs Pankhurst directly.
I asked her why she does it.
She said it makes her life worth something.
Shes just the hod carrier.
Im not a suffragette.
Im glad.
You know
they say that the way in which certain types of women have acted in the past months
gives a good deal of colour to the argument
that the mental equilibrium of the female sex is less than that of the males. But I dont agree.
Theres no madness in it.
They know exactly what theyre doing.
But my opinion doesnt matter.
My job is to enforce the law, Mrs Watts.
So Im going to give you some advice now
and I sincerely hope you take it.
Youll serve your time now.
At worst youll get a week.
Then you go home
to your husband.
They lied to us.
They didnt lie.
They promised nothing, they gave nothing.
Coat.
One set of stockings.
Hole, right foot.
Do not be alarmed, Maud.
Stay calm.
Were political prisoners. We have the right to wear our own clothes.
Arms up.
We have the right.
We have the right.
Sorry Georgie.
Your wife is a fucking disgrace Sonny.
You should be keeping her under control.
Police are bringing these bitches to their knees.
At least Maudll be used to that.
_
_
_
Come on Maud.
Shes missing her boy.
We all get separated from those we love, Maud.
My mother...
When I was a child I barely saw her.
She worked day and night,
fighting for me to be educated as my brother was,
but that didnt come without a sacrifice.
Theres Emily.
Shes done more time in here than any of us.
Shes on hunger strike now.
Orders from Mrs Pankhurst are were to follow.
If they will not accept us as political prisoners
then we will strike until they do.
Not Maud.
Its her first time.
Emily-
Violet-
Weve got a new member.
- This is Maud.
- Welcome, Maud.
Faster. Move.
Oh Hugh.
_
Welcome, Mrs Watts. Please come with us.
Ive got to go. Ive got to see my son.
Everyone gets one their first time, Maud.
Your first incarceration.
Thanks.
Mrs Miller -
The escalation of violence from the police will be met with force. Youll receive word.
Are they in?
Mrs Garston-
Sonny?
- Hows George?
- Hes asleep.
Im sorry Sonny.
I tried to get back as quickly as I could but they kept me there.
I cant look at you-
- You dont know what they did to us-
- Us?
Whats it done to me and George?
Ive had the police round.
I said I didnt know anything.
Got the whole street whispering.
I covered for you to Taylor but he knew.
Wont happen again.
Mama-
My darling.
Get back to bed.
Now.
Go on, Georgie.
You eaten?
Mrs Garston did her best.
Ill make you some tea.
I waited and waited for you till it was almost dawn.
I was praying for you to come home.
Im back now.
You wont ever shame me like that again.
Go on, on your way. Ive had enough of you.
Youve been nothing but trouble since you got here.
See you at home pal.
_
VOTES FOR WOMEN!
Hello, Maud.
Nice to see youre feeling better.
Sonny tells me youve not been well.
Its alright you know.
I found someone else willing to make up the hours.
Mom.
(You wait for me, will you?
I won't be long.)
Maud-
Violet.
Theres a big gathering on Friday.
Theyre saying shes to speak.
I gotta go.
I cant.
You cant not.
_
If wed had a girl, what would we have called her?
Margaret,
after my mother.
What kind of life would she have had?
Same as yours.
Im working late tonight.
Intelligence confirms a growing intention to retaliate.
Theyre putting their strategy in place.
Our contact in Lewisham tells us Mrs Pankhurst is to give an address.
- When?
- Any day now.
We dont know where yet...
But Im sure our East London ladies will lead us there.
Emily.
Maud. Its good to see you again.
Have you heard her speak before?
Many times. She is without fear.
Emily,
Ediths waiting for us.
You made it then?
- Edith!
- Youre here.
We must hurry. Itll be the first time shes appeared for months. Theyll be on alert to arrest her.
(??), Mrs Pankhurst.
_
- There you are Mrs Pankhurst.
- Thank you.
_
My friends.
In spite of His Majestys Government
I am here tonight.
I know the sacrifices you have made to be here.
Many of you, I know,
are estranged from the lives you once had.
Yet I feel your spirit tonight.
For fifty years
we have laboured peacefully to secure the vote for women.
We have been ridiculed, battered
and ignored.
Now we have realized that deeds and sacrifice must be the order of the day.
We are fighting for a time when every little girl born into the world
will have an equal chance with her brothers.
Never underestimate the power we women have to define our own destinies.
We do not want to be law breakers,
we want to be law makers.
Be militant. Each of you in your own way.
Those of you who can break windows, break them.
Those of you who can further attack the sacred idol of property,
do so.
We have been left with no alternative
but to defy this government.
If we must go to prison to obtain the vote,
let it be the windows of government not the bodies of women that shall be broken.
Round the back Maud. Round the back.
I incite this meeting,
and all the women in Britain,
to rebellion!
I would rather be a rebel than a slave!
Dont let Mrs Pankhurst be arrested!
No Surrender.
Its not her!
- Edith.
- Mrs P.
Dear Emily.
This is Mrs Watts, Mrs Pankhurst.
Maud.
Thank you, Maud.
Never surrender.
Never give up the fight!
_
_
Dont bother arresting them.
Let their husbands deal with them.
Drop them at their front doors.
Sonny. Im sorry.
I took you on, Maud.
I thought I could straighten you out.
What if you dont need to?
Youre a mother, Maud.
Youre a wife.
My wife.
Thats what youre meant to be.
Im not just that any more-
Sonny...Sonny,
what are you doing?
Sonny...
Sonny... Let me...
Get out!
Sonny! Let me see George!
Sonny. I want to see George.
Sonny.
Sonny!
Sonny!
I want to see George!
Sonny...
_
Right.
This is it.
Its two and six a week.
Make it two and four. The union will pay.
Come on, Maud.
Ill get you blankets and clothes from the WSPU jumble.
They collect stuff for women who-
Im sorry.
No no no.
Dont cry.
It aggravates them more if they see it hasnt touched you.
So you practise now on me.
Do it Maud.
And God shall wipe away all their tears;
there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying.
Neither shall there be any more pain:
for the former things
are passed away.
_
Two and four a week and a bed of bleedin nails!
Sweet dreams Maudy!
So, Mrs Pankhurst briefly out of hiding.
Gentlemen this is a deliberate escalation that the government will not accept.
Who knows what they will do next.
They have been given orders to be ready.
The East London branch in particular is to mobilise.
Should we be taking these threats seriously?
I would not underestimate the threat.
Neither would the Prime Minister.
If its to be tackled, we need to get closer in.
I hope to track down those still open to persuasion
and have them infiltrate and inform on the others.
Weve identified weaknesses in the ranks.
Were hoping one of them will break.
So Im going to release these to the press.
Here, Maud,
you seen yourself?
Shame of it.
Mrs Pankhursts undesirables.
Its not a bad photograph, though.
I might cut it out. Put it on my wall.
I want you out, Maud.
After everything I done for you.
And how Ive paid for it...
Mr Taylor.
What you looking at?!
Call the police!
Dont let her go!
Youll walk free.
Out of here today.
In return - you will help me.
There is information that you will pass to me...
Anything you know, anything you hear, even if its only a snippet or a piece of conversation, it is of interest.
Look at me.
He deserved it.
- If I told you-
- Do you really think anyone listens to girls like you?
That anyone cares?
They dont.
Youre nothing in the world.
I grew up with girls like you.
People who sacrificed life for revenge and a cause.
I know you.
And so do they.
They know how to draw on girls like you.
Girls without money, without prospects that want things to be better.
They primp and they preen and they fluff you and tell you that you are the foot soldiers of the cause.
But youre only fodder
for a battle that none of you can win.
I am offering you a lifeline.
Take it.
Before it is too late.
Come on, George.
George! Youre scuffing your shoes.
Whats the matter with you? What would your mother say?
George!
What am I going to do with you?
Come on.
Maud-
We thought you wouldnt come today.
March on.
Ta.
Next time get his left hand and all.
It was an accident.
Now ladies.
I ask you to remain vigilant when coming and going.
We know we are being watched
but hopefully
they will not expect to find us here.
I recognise the militant path may not be for all of you but,
well, all I ask is for you to make your decision now.
Anyone who doesnt want to stay may leave.
I need only those who can give their full commitment.
There will be no judgement.
Good, then we can begin.
Violet, tapers please.
Now.
I have marked the map.
The Pillar boxes are red.
The telegraph wires are green.
We shall cut into the heart of communications.
But remember, it is vital that no life is harmed during our activities.
We start early,
before dawn. That way the streets should be deserted.
Everyone take a list of locations.
Memorise them.
Then burn them.
We do not want them to fall into the wrong hands do we.
George. George.
George-
Oh, darling.
_
_
_
_
- Who dressed you this morning?
- Dad.
Dad.
Youve still got your nightshirt on.
When are you coming home?
I dont know.
Have you done something very bad, Mama?
I dont think so.
I just cant come home at the moment.
Is it because of your sickness?
Dad says youre not well in the head.
Thats not true, George.
Come on.
Here yare.
Thats for today.
Thats for tomorrow.
And thats to save till I see you next. Off you go-
George.
Go inside.
- Dont take him again, Maud.
- Let me see him.
Please.
Trust you with him?
After what you did to Taylor?
What did Taylor do to me, Sonny-?
For years.
George belongs with me.
The law says hes mine, Maud.
Where he belongs is up to me.
Thats the law.
Dear Mr Steed.
Ive thought about your offer,
and I have to say no.
You see I find I am a suffragette after all.
You told me no one listens to girls like me.
Well I cant have that anymore.
All my life Ive been respectful.
Done what men told me.
I know better now.
Im worth no more, no less than you.
Mrs Pankhurst once said
that if its right for men to fight for their freedom,
then its right for women to fight for theirs.
George back to bed.
If the law says I cant see my son,
I will fight to change that law.
We are both foot soldiers in our own way.
Come on Maud.
Come on everyone, find a partner.
Both fighting for our cause.
- Maud.
- Im alright.
You have to participate
if you want to change the way the world is run.
_
Jolly good.
I wont betray mine.
Would you betray yours?
If you thought I would,
you were wrong about me.
Yours sincerely,
Maud Watts.
Another explosion in Cadogan Square.
Its happening all over London, sir, and telegraph wires cut.
Miss Withers was seen in the vicinity.
Have you got a warrant?
_
Inspector.
Thats a lot of worming tablets, Mr Ellyn.
One of lifes great parasites, Inspector Steed.
Is your wife in?
- Edith-
- I am just concluding a treatment, Hugh-
I can go through-
Mastitis.
See you on Friday.
Youre a wet nurse now, Miss Withers?
Shall we get this over with?
You have searched before
and found nothing, but I am happy to comply again.
Youre a very clever woman Mrs Ellyn. Ill give you that.
The way you seduce these women,
draw them in,
train them in destruction.
Youre under arrest Mrs Withers
Id advise you not to struggle.
Get off.
- Come on.
- Get off!
- GET OFF ME!
- Id advise you not to struggle.
(Take her out.)
Am I also to be arrested?
Not today Mrs Ellyn.
No! No!
_
_
Miss Withers will get six months at least.
I can do a few weeks, Edith, but-
What are you saying?
This is not the time to stand down.
No, we push on. Capitalise on the press interest.
The press do nothing but scorn and mock us.
They scorn and mock us because they feel our threat.
- Mrs Haughton.
- Ladies.
Have you got the information I asked for?
Lloyd Georges summer house is not yet completed.
He was complaining about it at dinner just the other night.
Its being built next to the golf course at Walton-on-the-Hill,
paid for by the owner of The News of the World.
Invaluable information, thank you.
Edith,
come here.
Mrs Watts.
How is your son?
Its his birthday tomorrow.
I am so sorry for you...
I trusted in my husband...
and this Government.
I was wrong.
I have to go.
Please just listen to me Edith.
A ministers home- its going too far.
Why too far?
Its unoccupied, it is empty, no one will be harmed-
Your commitment, Edith...
I have always known you would take it as far as it must go but this...
Mrs Pankhurst, she asked us-
Then Mrs Pankhurst asks too much.
Violet! Vi!
You cant do this.
You cant bring me into this and then just leave me.
Im sorry Maud, but I cant.
Not now...
I cant care for the ones Ive got.
When are you due?
Summer.
Oh Maud Im so tired.
I just want to wish him Happy Birthday.
At least let me do that.
Not now.
Sonny -
- Sonny?
- Dont- Youre too late-
This is Mr and Mrs Drayton.
Theyre taking George.
What you talking about?
Adopting him.
- Sonny-
- We have a very nice home.
With a garden and-
..all that hell need.
- No, George-
- I cant look after him.
- I cant be a mother to him.
- Sonny, please, just let me have him-
We have no family Maud.
No one to take him. I cant do it all.
Mrs Garston wont take him, no one around here will.
- Weve been cast out, Maud.
- Please Sonny, let me...Please!
Georgie, come here!
Say your goodbyes and let him go.
Open your present.
Georgie.
Your mothers name is Maud Watts.
Dont forget that name,
because I will be waiting for you to find me.
Will you find me George?
Dont forget it.
_
- Come on-
- No!
Im sorry.
Mama-
Sonny...
Sonny.
Mama-
Sonny, no!
- What have you done-
- Its for the best.
What have you done?
What have you done? What have you done?
What have you done?
What have you done?
- Maud.
- What have you done?
- Can I help you with that?
- No. I can do it.
So, Violet will not be joining us any more?
No,
she questioned our strategy.
Our friends are there to challenge us.
To keep the balances and checks, Edith.
No no no there can be no doubting.
The movement is divided now.
Even Sylvia Pankhurst is opposed to her mother and her sisters militant strategy.
The only way is forward.
And what if you blow yourself up with one of those damned things?
What happens to your damned cause then?
- Emily.
- You alright?
Maud!
Hugh! Go!
Mrs Watts.
Come with us please.
Youre under arrest.
When women attack the home of a government minister
we have reached a state of anarchy we can no longer ignore.
This has to stop.
The press can only be tamed so long. They grow more and more interested
in these damned women whilst we in government must try and quash every new story.
Pankhurst claims responsibility for the bombing and faces prison
while the real culprits go free.
Shes going to milk every ounce of attention she can in prison.
- Weve made some key arrests.
- Punish those responsible.
In whatever way you can.
You women cleaned yourselves up well.
We couldnt find a scrap of dynamite on any of you.
- Then why am I here?
- Oh youll be charged
for illegal meetings if for nothing else.
You know there was a housekeeper on her way back when the bomb went off?
She forgot her gloves.
If she was two minutes later -
what would that have done for your cause?
Violence doesnt discern.
It takes the innocent and the guilty.
What gives you the right to put that womans life at risk?
What gave you the right
to stand in the middle of a riot and watch women beaten and do nothing?
- Youre a hypocrite-
- I uphold the law.
The law means nothing to me. Ive had no say in making the law.
Thats an excuse, its all we have.
We break windows.
We burn things. Because War is the only language that men listen to.
Cause youve beaten us and betrayed us and theres nothing else left.
Then theres nothing left but to stop you.
What are you gonna do?
Lock us all up?
Were in every home, were half the human race, you cant stop us all.
You might lose your life before this is over.
But we will win.
_
Five days. Will you eat now?
No!
Hold her still.
Treatment of them grows increasingly barbaric, Sir.
What is the alternative?
They will not hold us to ransom with their threats.
My fear is they wont break, Sir.
If one of them dies then well have blood on our hands and theyll have their martyr.
That must not happen.
Or Mrs Pankhurst will have won.
_
_
Can I drive you?
Best not.
I have left you bedding in the church.
The Union will send you word.
_
Maud?
Violet!
I heard you was sleeping here.
Its only bread and bit of broth.
Ta.
A little at a time. Your tummy will be sore after what youve been through.
Whatever youre planning next,
you be careful.
You get caught again, youll see two years inside at least.
- Maybe longer.
- Violet.
Maybe worse.
Ow.
Little monkey.
George used to kick noon til night.
Hows Maggie?
Working every hour God sends down at the laundry.
Shes the only one who can bring in a proper wage now.
Now come on.
You eat something.
When did they raid?
First thing this morning. Six arrests.
Edith.
What are you doing here? Youre not well.
There will be a vigil
for Mrs Pankhurst tonight at Westminster Abbey.
Shes not going to last this time in prison, Maud.
The King must pardon her.
Hes not going to pardon her, Emily.
Then weve got to make him.
How, when the government silences the press?
Look, one column on the bombing.
How do we make ourselves heard?
One just has to gather ones strength.
If it is the worlds attention we must capture-
We take it straight to the King.
Do something he cant ignore.
No, Edith. Youre too weak to face another prison sentence.
Oh, nonsense Hugh.
- Maud, please.
- Shes right.
Every violent assault weakens her.
Her heart cannot take it.
Maud.
It is the Derby on Wednesday.
The King is to attend.
Therell be thousands there.
You will be stopped before you even get through the racecourse gates.
In those crowds well go unnoticed.
Well raise our flag in front of the worlds cameras.
- The Kings horse-
- will be third in the parade ring.
- Done.
- The eyes of the world upon us.
Maud no matter the risk we must not fail.
I want you to have this.
Edith gave it to me.
_
It has been an inspiration to a great many of us.
Thank you.
So.
Tomorrow then?
Tomorrow.
Heres the latest from surveillance sir.
Its Maud Watts.
Shes sleeping in St Barthes church.
Hugh,
are we ready?
I just need two milligrams of the cold salt tincture, if you please.
Could you not have finished the orders last night?
What did you say?
Cold Salt-
Hugh-
Hugh.
Hugh!
Let me out.
I cant.
What do you mean.
What do you mean?
Im sorry. Youve given enough.
Were going to be late...Let me out.
Please, let me out!
Your heart wont take it Edith.
I cant let you out. Im sorry.
_
_
_
Please have your tickets ready ladies and gentlemen.
Please have your tickets ready.
Please have your tickets ready ladies and gentlemen.
Wheres Edith?
She werent at the station.
Miss?
Would you like to take the next turnstile?
The queue is much shorter.
Ta.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.
There he is.
_
Theres the King.
_
Now.
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty...
Sorry Miss.
Its green badges to enter the paddock.
Can I help you?
Thank you very much, Sir.
Sorry.
We will find another way.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
_
_
Excuse me.
_
Follow me.
Sorry.
Sorry, sir.
Emily-
Emily-
Excuse me,
_
Excuse me,
sorry Sir, sorry.
Emily-
Emily?
Never surrender. Never give up the fight.
Emily...
Maggie.
Maggie,
come on darlin,
- come on. Lets go.
- What you doing, Mrs Watts?
- Where you taking me?
- Its alright.
Oi! Maud.
(It's alright, it's alright.)
Get back to work!
(Ellen, I will get the door myself.)
- Maud-
- This is Maggie,
Violets daughter.
She can launder and sew.
She does the best collar starching. And she can clean.
Come in Maggie.
Be good.
- Dont talk back.
- Maud-
The woman wanderer goes forth
to seek the land of freedom.
How am I to get there?
Reason answers:
There is one way,
and one way only.
Down the banks of labour.
Through the waters of suffering.
There is no other.
The woman,
having discarded all to which shed formally clung cries out.
For what do I go to this far land which no one has ever reached?
I am alone.
I am utterly alone.
_
Its in every paper.
They say thousands will line the streets.
_
We go on,
Edith.
You taught me that.
_
Its almost one oclock Maggie, get your gloves and help Mrs Ellyn.
And reason said to her:
Silence.
What do you hear?
And she said:
I hear the sound of feet.
A thousand times
ten thousands, and thousands and thousands and they beat this way.
They are the feet of those that shall follow you.
Lead on.
