Oh my, God.
Please help me!
Oh, God...
Jason!
It's all done, Jason.
You've done your job well,
and Mommy is pleased.
That's a good boy.
Now, come to Mommy.
Come on.
Come on.
Mommy has a reward
for you.
Jason, Mother
is talking to you.
Jason, Mother
is talking to you.
Come on.
Come on.
That's my boy. Come.
Kneel down.
That's a boy.
Kneel down.
Kneel down, Jason.
That's my good boy.
That's a good boy.
Good, Jason.
Ginny!
Come on.
Let's go. Ginny.
Jesus.
Come on.
God damn it, Harold!
I spent all day yesterday
washing your clothes.
Look what you're
doing to them!
You know I work
very hard around here
trying to keep up with you
and all your sloppy habits.
And I get no help
from you at all.
The community of
Crystal Lake... Jerk!
...was shocked
today with reports
of a grisly
mass murder scene.
Eight corpses
have been discovered
in what is
already being called
the most brutal and heinous
crime in local history.
A police spokesman
told Eye-On News
that they've been combing the
area since just before dawn
and are afraid that their gruesome
discovery is just the beginning.
Police Chief
Scott Fitzsimmons
had no comment
about the murders
when reached
early this morning.
Detectives at the scene,
however, were baffled
by the brutality
of the killings.
Bodies were found
literally strewn
over the four-square-mile
campground
in the remote
lake region.
Ginny Field
miraculously survived
repeated attacks by
the ax-wielding killer
and was taken to
a local hospital today.
She is in serious condition...
Oh, my God.
...suffering from multiple stab
wounds and severe hysterical shock.
The names of the eight
victims are being withheld
until notification
of next of kin.
Reports of cannibalism
and sexual mutilations
are still unconfirmed
at this hour.
What are you doing
out there?
The person responsible for the Crystal
Lake horror remains at large.
Harold, I swear...
Jesus Christ, Harold.
Just take what's yours and
leave the rest for me to do.
Very considerate.
Could've at least
finished the job.
Do I have to do
everything around here?
Harold?
Okay, boys, soup's on.
What's the matter, Lionel?
Aren't you hungry?
Come on, it's good.
Here, look.
I'm eating.
It is good.
Dayfly eggs?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on. If Edna
catches you in here,
she'll make
a fur coat out of you.
Come on,
I'll take you home.
Didn't I feed you
enough for supper?
The doctor said you have to
lose weight, now didn't he?
You know,
I'm trying to help you,
but you just keep sneaking
food behind my back.
What am I gonna
do with you?
And would you put that filthy
animal back where it belongs?
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. What are
you so nervous about?
Come on.
Who would do
something like this?
What's the matter?
What happened?
It's all that crap you've
been stuffing yourself with!
It's Easy Money  time,
the easy money show
where everybody wins.
Now, where's that
other needle?
Thank you, Johnny, and good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Yes, it's Easy Money,
Charlie Lincoln,
and I'm here to
give away money.
I've got a pocketful of money
burning a hole in my pocket...
Charles Dickens,
ladies and gentlemen.
Harold?
Fourteen straight
weeks in a row.
Harold?
That's not the end.
Harold?
It's the white house
on the left.
Shelly, come
and meet your date.
Bring her to me!
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.
Sex, sex, sex. You guys are
getting boring, you know that?
What would a weekend in the
country be without sex?
Cool it, Andy.
I didn't mean it
that way.
Look, you guys, I want you to
have a good time this weekend.
What happened to me at the
lake happened a long time ago.
I'm fine,
really, okay?
Just forget
about me.
I'm supposed to forget
that we've been friends...
Ah!
God damn it, Shelly!
Why do you always have
to be such an asshole?
I beg your pardon. I'm not
an asshole. I'm an actor.
Same thing.
Look, Shelly,
you're my roommate,
and I like you.
Most of the time.
But you've gotta quit
doing those things.
Now, I got you a date,
didn't I? Didn't I?
Yeah.
So don't embarrass me.
Just relax.
Be yourself.
Would you be yourself
if you looked like this?
Yes?
Hi, Mrs. Sanchez. I'm Chris.
We've come to
pick up Vera.
She is not going!
What are they saying?
I don't know.
I flunked Spanish.
Hi, everybody.
What are you looking at?
Is everything
all right?
Just your basic old-fashioned
mother problems.
So which one's
my date?
Hi.
You're Shelly?
Sorry.
Hey, the van's on fire!
Is that all you two are gonna
do this weekend? Smoke dope?
Why not, man? Is there a
law against it?
There are better things
to do with your life.
Like what?
I can't think
of anything.
Hey, Chrissy. How much
further to the lake?
We would've been there
already if some people
didn't have to go to the
bathroom every five minutes.
That's what happens
when you're pregnant.
Sure, why not?
Hey! Let's share the wealth with those
less fortunate up front here. Huh?
Yeah.
What do you
got in there?
My whole world.
In that little thing?
Stick around.
You'll see.
- It's the cops.
- Oh, my God!
What?
They're catching us.
What are we
gonna do?
Destroy the evidence! Hurry!
No way, man.
Let's go, Chuck!
Come on!
- They're gaining on us.
- Throw it out!
No, they'll see it.
We gotta get
rid of it. Eat it.
The cops are gonna get us.
We're going to jail!
I'm driving.
Breakfast?
No way! We're pregnant,
remember?
Faster! Eat faster!
Why don't
you help us?
I guess
I'm just not hungry.
You're always hungry,
Shelly. Come on, eat!
I'm allergic to pot.
I gotta pull over.
Oh, man!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Charlie
63 is unable to handle...
Help out the ambulance.
I'll get the crowd.
Okay, you guys,
show's over.
Let's move it back
over here, all right?
Come on, you guys.
Hey, kiddo. Don't let your
imagination run away with you.
Chris, stop the van.
Stop!
What is it?
What are you doing?
You almost
ran over him!
I must have been daydreaming.
I didn't even see him.
Hey, he looks just
like my grandfather.
Why,
I must be in heaven!
Don't touch him. You
don't know where he's been.
Thank you.
Sleeping in the
middle of the road?
You are, indeed, all of you,
kind and generous young people.
Look upon what his grace
has brought unto me!
What is that?
I found this today.
There were other parts
of the body.
That's an eyeball!
And he said that he wanted
me to have this. This.
He wanted me
to warn you!
Look upon this omen
and go back from
whence ye came!
I have warned thee!
I have warned thee.
Check it out!
Why don't we take our bags
into the house first.
Chris, come on down.
You go ahead.
I'm gonna take my bags in the
house first and look around.
Don't you dare!
I'm not ready!
Hello?
Is someone here?
Rick!
Is it my imagination or did
it just get cold in here?
Did I do something wrong?
Did I?
No. It's just
being here again.
I know it's only been two years, but
I feel like I've been away forever.
Doesn't look like
anything's changed, though.
Even the paintings
are still crooked.
Well, you've
certainly changed.
Don't you even
say hello anymore?
I'm sorry.
Hello, Rick.
How are you?
Well, that's a start.
Could you just
slow down, please?
There's a whole
weekend ahead of us.
Let me get to
know you again.
Let me get to know
this place again.
Okay. But there's only so
many cold showers I can take.
Come outside and help me
with the bags.
Oh, God!
You know, Chris, I think you've
gained some weight since last summer.
I have not!
You creep.
Put me down.
Here, you get the ones inside.
I'll get the ones off the top.
Wasn't this door closed
a few minutes ago?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Chris...
That's my bag.
I'll take care of it.
Shelly, what are you
doing in there?
Why aren't you down at the
lake with everybody else?
Oh! They said they were
going skinny-dipping.
And I'm not
skinny enough.
This was my bedroom.
It's yours
for the weekend.
Great.
Chris?
I don't mean to be picky or
anything, but where's the bed?
Chris?
Oh!
It's right here.
What's this?
It's your bed.
A hammock?
You might like it.
Why not?
Where's the bed?
All right.
Chris, I don't understand
why you guys have so much hay.
You don't even have any horses.
You never did.
It's my
father's idea.
Every year, he makes
plans to buy a horse
and every year, he buys all
this hay but no horse.
You figure it out.
You realize, of course, that
I gave up an opportunity
to spend the weekend with
Mary Jo Conrad for this.
You mean you actually
gave up the chance
to be with the Mary Jo
Conrad for little old me?
That's right.
Boy, are you dumb.
Okay, Chris, I realize I'm
just a dumb country boy
and my feelings
really don't matter.
But this is the sweat of a worker
on my forehead, not of a lover.
Now, I believe
that there is a time and
a place for everything.
And now's the time
and now's the place,
if you know what I mean.
So, what I think
we should do
is set aside three hours a
day to fulfill our needs.
One in the morning
and two at night.
If you agree,
I agree.
Were you talking to me?
Is anyone in here?
What's going on?
You check down here.
I'll check the upstairs.
Is anybody in there?
Don't look at him.
Let's just get
the hell out of here.
We heard screaming.
Oh, my God!
- What happened to him?
- Is he dead?
- Don't touch him, Andy!
- Don't move him!
You creep! Get up!
I guess I fooled you?
You jerk!
Chris, leave him alone.
He doesn't know
any better.
It was a joke!
- Chris.
- It was just a joke.
I didn't mean to...
You never mean to.
I gotta get out of here.
I'm going to the store.
Can I use your car?
Oh, sure.
Thanks.
Asshole!
Hey, hey, hey. Hey,
let me go with you!
I gotta get out
of here too.
Chris.
Chris, wait up.
What's wrong?
It's that
creep, Shelly.
What a sick
sense of humor.
Oh, that's just his way
of getting attention.
He doesn't know
what happened.
I know it, Deb.
But from the minute
we got here,
I've been seeing things
and hearing things.
It's probably
just my imagination.
I shouldn't have
come back here so soon.
Don't let it
get to you.
Relax.
Enjoy the weekend.
Nothing's gonna happen to you
when we're all here together.
Okay.
Hey. How are things
with Rick going?
Okay.
But he just
doesn't understand.
That'll be $18.50.
We don't accept
no food stamps.
Shelly!
I need some money.
Excuse me, but I believe
that's my wallet.
Make a wish.
Can I buy you two guys
a beer or something?
I'll take that now.
Is this your rubber?
Didn't your mama
teach you manners?
If you want something,
you ask.
Nice.
Please, be cool.
May I please
have the wallet?
You mean, "May I please
have the wallet, ma'am?"
May I please have
the wallet, ma'am?
That's good.
That's real nice.
Hey, that was a 20!
Are they following us?
No!
Good.
Here. You drive.
The way I feel right now, I'd
probably get us into an accident.
Next time, I'll know how to
handle a situation like that.
Let's just hope next time
isn't too soon.
Uh-oh!
Oh, shit!
"Oh, shit" is right.
Let's get out of here.
Hold on!
What are you doing?
He went too far
this time.
Oh, shit!
I did it. I did it. I did it!
Did I do it?
Yes, you did it.
You were great.
I was great.
You son of a bitch!
You ought to come
back here, you bastard!
You ain't getting
away with this!
God damn it!
I'm gonna get you!
What do you say we go
get some exercise?
This is all
the exercise I need.
That was close.
Hey, you better watch out
with that thing.
Come on.
I'm warning you, Andy.
I'll break your string.
I wonder what
happened to them.
What happened to
your windshield, man?
We had a slight misunderstanding
with a motorcycle gang.
Yeah, but Shelly made them
see the error of their ways.
Didn't you, Shell?
It was nothing.
My poor car.
What did you do to it?
Yeah, well, we're real
sorry, you know?
But it wasn't
our fault.
A few minor repairs,
it'll be good as new.
That's it.
I've had it.
I thought it would be a good idea
for us to spend some time together,
but this is a little more
than I bargained for.
Where are you going?
Away from here.
Stay with me.
Why should I?
Because
I want you to.
You don't play fair,
do you? Get in.
Hey. Let's go
for a swim.
I don't know.
Come on.
We'll be all alone.
We can do
whatever we want.
Nobody'll see.
Sounds disgusting.
Let's go.
I'll grab a couple of towels.
I'll see you down there.
Maybe we shouldn't
do this, Ali.
We gotta even
the score, don't we?
Nobody's gonna get
hurt, okay, baby?
Right.
Trust me.
Let me do it.
I know
what I'm doing.
Oh, shit.
Who's up there?
Here, take this in the
barn and start pouring.
And find Fox.
What the hell
are you doing?
Get off that thing.
This feels good!
Ali is gonna be pissed, he
sees you screwing around.
Now, come on.
We got shit to do.
What the hell?
Fox?
Where are you?
Stop screwing around.
You're messing
everything up!
You're dead now, woman.
Fox.
Fox. Loco.
Open the damn door.
Fox.
What the hell are you
guys doing up there?
You hear me
talking to you?
Fox!
When I find you, you
bastard, you're a dead man!
Shit!
I don't wanna go home.
This is fun.
I know.
What are you doing?
We haven't been
in the barn...
We haven't been in the barn yet.
Let's take a look.
Not now.
I'm cold.
Come on, Debbie, how about
a little roll in the hay?
Go play with yourself. I'm
going into the house.
Hey, wait up!
Is that better?
Yeah. Thanks.
You know, I don't think I
could live anywhere else.
The nights are always so
peaceful and quiet here.
It's deceiving.
What do you mean?
The quiet can fool you.
It fooled me.
Chris, why'd you
come back here?
To prove something
to myself.
To prove I'm stronger
than I think I am.
What about us?
I'm here with you.
Can't that be
enough for now?
I don't know. I mean, I don't
see you for months on end.
Then when I do, you put
this barrier up between us.
How do I
break through?
You give up?
You out of your mind?
Do you give up?
Never.
I know
how to stop this.
Andy?
I can think of much better things for
you to be doing with your hands.
You win.
I guess that leaves
you and me. Sort of.
Yep.
You really are
very good at that.
It's nothing.
Vera, you and I have gotten to know
each other a little today, you know?
And I like you.
I like you a lot.
I was thinking that maybe,
you know, we could...
I don't think so.
Look, I'm gonna go outside
for a few minutes.
And then when I get back
in, we'll talk, okay?
Sure. We'll talk.
Bitch.
How do we do it?
Well, first we take
our clothes off
and then you get on top of me,
or I could get on top of you.
I know how to do it. I mean, how
do we do it in the hammock?
Well, I think you can
figure something out.
I'll think of something.
You're right.
I should have told you everything
a long time ago, but I couldn't.
Look, Chris, you don't have
to if you don't want to.
I want to. I want you to know what
happened so you'll understand.
Everything is so clear
in my mind,
as if it were
happening right now.
I don't know
if you remember,
but when you dropped me off
that night, it was very late.
I knew my parents would be waiting
for me, but I didn't care.
We had
such a good time.
The minute I walked in the door,
my parents started yelling at me
and cursing me.
We had
such a big fight.
My mom slapped me.
That was the first time
my mother had ever hit me.
I couldn't believe it.
I ran out the door
and into the woods.
I wanted to punish them.
So I decided to
hide out all night.
I thought I'd get them so worried that
they'd be sorry for what they did.
It had been raining and the
woods were cold and wet,
but I found a dry spot
under an old oak tree.
I guess I fell asleep.
All I can remember next
is being startled out of sleep
by the sound of footsteps.
I was sure it was Dad, so I just
sat up and I listened for him.
But the footsteps stopped.
Then there was this
cracking noise behind me.
I turned around,
and standing there was
this hideous-looking man.
He was so grotesque,
he was almost inhuman.
He had a knife.
And he attacked me
with it.
I was so hysterical, I don't know
how I was even able to think,
but I kicked the knife
out of his hands and I ran.
But he ran after me
and he caught me
and he pulled me
down on the ground.
I was kicking and screaming and
yelling, but it didn't do any good.
He dragged me
along the ground.
I blacked out.
I don't know what happened after that.
I just don't know.
Chris? It's all right.
You're all right.
When I woke up,
I was in my own bed.
My parents have never
said a word about it.
They act as if the whole thing
never happened, but it did.
All I want is to just
forget it, but I can't.
I'll never forget that
horrible face, never!
What's that?
Damn it,
it's that battery.
I charged it
yesterday.
Must not have taken.
It may just start anyway.
Let me try.
We're gonna have to
walk back. It's okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
I know
a pretty good shortcut.
Shelly?
Heavy shit!
Who's there?
Shelly, if this is another
one of your tricks...
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you like that.
Between you and Shelly, I'm lucky I
haven't had a heart attack already.
What's butterball
up to now?
I don't know. He just
ducked into the barn.
Come on, let's give him
some of his own medicine.
I don't think he's in here.
Let's go back.
Maybe that wasn't him.
Chili.
Are you crazy?
I guess
he must've left.
Come on,
let's get out of here.
I'm not going to
let anybody hurt you.
Gee, thanks. I
feel a lot better now.
That'll teach you
a valuable lesson:
A beautiful girl like you should
never go out in the dark alone.
Damn it, Shelly!
Why do you do
these stupid things?
I have to.
No, you don't
have to.
I just want you
to like me.
I do like you.
But not when you
act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better
than being a nothing.
I never said
you were nothing.
You don't have to say it.
I could tell.
You're wrong.
Shelly!
Chuck? Chili?
Hey. What are you
guys doing in there?
Are you guys doing
something I shouldn't see?
That's great.
Hey, I dropped
your wallet.
I'm sorry. I got it.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Hey, now cut that out right now.
That's not funny.
That was
the best one yet.
Was it you, me
or the hammock?
I vote for me.
I vote for the hammock.
Where you going?
I'm taking a shower. You
ought to try it sometime.
Hey, Debbie,
can you hear me?
Barely.
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get a brew.
You want one?
Andy?
Oh, Jesus.
Do you want
a beer or not?
Sure.
All right.
Be right back.
Okay.
Andy.
Andy!
Yeah?
Are you still
out there?
I can't hear you.
Andy?
Will you quit
fooling around?
Cut it out.
Andy? I changed my mind.
I don't want that beer.
Andy?
Andy?
Andy?
Andy? Did you hear me
about that beer?
Andy!
Oh, God, I hate when you
don't answer me.
What?
Where's this coming from?
Great shortcut, Rick.
Come on,
let's move it.
Always spoiling
my fun.
What was
that noise?
What?
I don't know. I heard
something over there.
Come on,
let's get home.
Did I hear you screaming?
No.
It's probably Debbie
having an orgasm.
How come you never scream
when we have sex?
Give me something
to scream about.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I was just practicing.
Don't do that to me!
Here. Go down the cellar
and check the fuse box.
In the dark? Alone?
Be a man, man.
Nothing to be
afraid of, man.
So, what if it's dark?
Nothing to be afraid of.
Jeez!
Oh, God.
All right.
Who's there?
Chuck, you back
already?
Well, at least you got the
outside lights working.
Nice makeup job.
Stop fooling around, man.
That's better.
What's going on?
Get up!
Shelly, enough is enough!
Oh, my God!
Andy? Debbie?
Shelly's dead!
He's dead!
Andy! Deb...
No!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
This wind
sure came up.
Seems awfully quiet.
It's hard to believe the wild
bunch is already in bed.
Yeah, well, who knows
with those guys?
I can't get
this door open.
There's something
behind it.
Oh, I smell
something burning.
Here, take this.
Let me do it.
No wonder. Some idiot
put this chair there.
Something is burning.
Lights aren't
working either.
Oh, real smart.
What's going on here?
You tell me.
They're your friends.
I'm gonna go out to the living room
and check what's going on there.
Okay.
Andy, Debbie,
are you guys up there?
Anybody here?
Everybody else has
taken off and left us.
They wouldn't do that.
I don't know
what's going on,
but I'm gonna go outside
and take a look around.
Rick, wait.
I wanna come with you.
Andy? Is that you?
Rick?
Rick?
Rick?
Is everything
all right?
Where's that coming from?
I don't know what kind of
game you guys are playing,
but I don't like it.
Debbie?
You guys up here?
Hey, come on, you guys.
You're wrecking the house.
Rick!
Rick!
Rick!
Where are you?
Rick! Help me!
Rick!
Rick!
Rick! Rick!
No!
No!
Keys. Keys!
Come on!
What's happening?
No!
Come on. Come on!
Gas.
You can't be alive.
You!
You psycho!
No!
No! No! No!
No!
Looks like she's the only
one left alive.
What was all that about
a lady in the lake?
She must've flipped out. That
poor kid's been through hell.
All of her friends...
I'll take her.
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.
