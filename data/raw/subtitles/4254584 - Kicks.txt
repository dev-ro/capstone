Minus 15...
T-minus ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,
five, four, three,
two, one, zero.
Sometimes,
I wish I had a spaceship.
Just hang out in space
where it's quiet.
And no one can fuck with me.
Even when I dream,
I dream about
getting chased.
I got the mack in
my knapsack loungin ' black,
smoking sacks, up in acts
Sidekicks with my sidekicks,
rockin' fly kicks
I've never been
in a real fight.
Mainly because
I've always been fast.
Mom says when
you're small, like me,
you gotta watch
out for yourself.
I ain't gonna lie, though.
Kids at school are
always fucking with me,
making fun of my shoes
and how broke I am.
I don't tell my mom
'cause I don't want
to see her upset.
I once heard this
real famous comic
say that
deciding to wear flip-flops
is like saying,
"I hope I don't
get chased today."
That's why I don't wear
fucking flip-flops.
I'm from the East Bay,
Richmond, California.
Cheez-Its.
That's where you
need to start the story.
We eating Cheez-Its...
Those are my two
best friends...
Cheez-Its?
We eating Cheez-Its...
You don't even
got Cheez-Its...
What up, man? You look
like a little girl
coming down the street.
We do everything together.
Tie that shit up.
Anyway,
look, we chillin'
eating Cheez-Its.
Out of nowhere, she just
starts sucking my dick.
I swear to God.
That's Rico.
I put that online.
He don't take
shit from nobody.
Like, all he do is
just sit around and smoke.
But he's still ripped.
Guys don't fuck with him.
But girls do.
He can't give it to
you like I can, baby!
That's Albert.
You fuckin' around.
I'm going to leave.
All he do
is talk about pussy.
But I don't think
he ever seen one.
He says he's some
kind of R&B genius.
All you got to do
Hey, bro...
Hey, run that shit
back one time.
Put that auto-tune
all the way up...
Bitch, shut the fuck up!
Can't you see me
in the studio?
Nigga, fuck you.
You in
a motherfucking closet
with your fat ass.
The greatest of all time.
Hey, bro.
Pussy Mix Tape, bro.
Hottest shit out.
Volume Four, bro.
Man, don't nobody want
to buy my shit, bruh.
'Cause you wank.
Man, fuck you.
I'ma make it, nigga.
Every day we do the same shit.
I don't know, man.
Red Ones...
We talk about the same shit.
They're not
just freakin' shoes.
Those are J's.
You know how much
head I would get
if I had...
Albert's got the 6's.
Rico's got the 3's.
Them 11's, though?
That's the shit
right there.
Fresh feet equals...
Respect, nigga.
Balls-deep, nigga.
Right?
You know it.
You don't know.
Fresh feet equals
balls-deep.
I knew that.
Quiet 'cause they 'bout it
'Cause it's too loud
You know what, I'm rapping now
I'ma pass it to my nigga B
You're up.
All right...
What the fuck?
Come on, man.
Said nothing
like the rest, nigga
Sicka then the next nigga
The Bay ain't behind me
'cause I keep it on my chest
Sometimes,
it feel like everybody
cooler than me.
You're supposed
to push me next.
No.
Hey, you trying
to get faded, B?
You got a light?
Yeah.
Maybe because I'm small...
Get the fuck
out of here!
I don't know.
You see
my friend over there?
That one over there.
What you laughing for?
Go talk to him.
Like, in school,
I can't play pick up,
can't take a piss,
can't pull no girls...
Boo, nigga.
Can I help you?
Bruh, she must have
had the balls in there,
and everything.
Shit. You know I love it
when they do that shit,
too, nigga.
Shut the fuck up.
You ain't never
had your dick wet.
Nigga, fuck you.
Damn, B,
that kid looks like you.
Except, he don't
have shoes from
middle school.
The Bred 1's.
The black and red ones.
The originals.
First Jordans ever made, man.
Damn.
If I had those...
Excuse me.
Yo, what up?
Do you have these
in a seven?
Nah, they don't
make kids' sizes.
How much are they?
$350.
Mom always
hides my birthday money.
She say, I got to
save up for emergencies.
Hey, little boy. You.
Curly-haired
little boy, come here.
Yeah, you, come on.
Talking to you.
How you doing?
Ol' Will-Smith's-son-
looking little boy.
What's going on
with you, man?
Check it out, man.
Look what I got
for you, baby.
How you doing?
Now don't hurt
your eyes right now,
I'm gonna show
you some stuff
that you might not
never seen before.
Where'd you get
all these at?
Don't worry about that.
Why your shoes look like that?
I got some stuff for you.
My name's Daryl.
What's your name?
Brandon.
What's up
with you, boy?
Let me show you
some stuff, man.
You might want
some of these stuff.
Your foot game
is everything in
this world, man.
Let me show you these.
You seen these?
Brand-new. You feel me?
Those nice.
You like those, huh?
I got something
that's gonna be
nice on you, though.
The stores don't
even got these, boy.
These exclusive, you see.
But these right here,
these cost more
than your life.
Damn!
Blood, you did not
buy these. Your mama
got 'em for you?
I bought 'em.
Nigga, please.
The "Bred"
Air Jordan 1's?
Yeah.
Nigga, are these
fucking originals?
Yeah.
Man, they, like,
a grand on
the Internet.
How you get them?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Look, look, look.
I swear to God,
I bought 'em.
Like, for real, I did.
Listen, I was walking
home when I saw
Crazy Daryl on 23rd.
So, I'm like,
"Yo, Daryl."
And then, he like,
"What up, my nigga?"
So, you know
I'm talking to...
No, he didn't.
Man, anyway...
I'm like,
"What you got?"
And then, he, like,
"Hey, blood, check
this out right here.
"Nigga, you ain't
gon' find this shit
anywhere else.
"This shit cost more
than your whole life."
When I seen them rereleases
looking sweet,
I had to cop 'em.
So I'm, like, "How much?"
This nigga, like, "$200, bro."
So, I turn to walk away
knowing this nigga
playing me and shit.
Then he's, like,
"Wait, nah, I meant $150."
- And I'm like, "Yeah, nigga.
- That's more like it!"
And I was, like, "Peace."
That's how I got 'em.
Whatever, nigga.
Your dick get bigger,
too, or something?
Bro, leave
his dick out of this.
I'm just saying, man.
Your feet got bigger...
Did your dick
finally get longer?
Why you love
my dick so much, man?
Got 'em.
This li'l nigga
was born tonight.
I 'ma tell auntie

Ridin' that bike over there
like Mr. Kool-Aid-on-a-bike

Somebody call
Captain Save-a-ho!
Dumbass lookin' nigga.
I need to get me
some of them shoes,
though, on the cool.
Hey, B. Come play
with me, nigga.
Nah, I don't wanna
fuck up my shoes.
Nigga, they're called
Jordans for a reason.
He plays basketball.
Stupid ass.
Who's your friend?
Who?
Fat Albert?
No, not Fat Albert.
Who's that?
Little B?
Yeah.
Hey, Brandon!
Get your ass
over here, man.
Go talk to him.
No, not you.
Where'd you get
your shoes?
This place.
I like them.
Want some?
Yeah.
Um, we're gonna go
smoke and drink in
Jamica's garage later,
and probably
go see a movie.
You should come.
I don't know.
Probably busy.
"Probably busy"?
What you mean?
Can I have my drink back?
No.
You gotta say you're
coming, and you
have to mean it.
All right,
well, I'm coming.
You gotta mean it.
I promise.
Can I have it back now?
You gotta promise.
I promise.
Okay.
You better come.
You gonna put it
in her booty hole?
Brandon's gonna
get his first blow J!
What?
Hey, you sure you don't
wanna come over and
play some video games?
Watch this porn

Nah, I'm straight.
Come on, man.
They fart in
each other's mouths,
and they like it.
It's hilarious.
You gotta watch it.
- Bro, I'm cool.
- Oh!
I get it.
Nigga trying
to get so fresh,
so clean, clean,
for his first kiss
and shit.
Exactly.
I've kissed
a girl before.
Whatever, man. Look...
If you wanna
shave your balls,
make sure you
get clean strokes.
No side-to-side.
That shit hurts.
All right, then, y'all.
Later, nigga.
Oh, hey, hold on.
What y'all about

Man, who gives a shit.
Wear what you want.
Hey,

You ain't catching me.
Hey, bro, you got

Your mama got them

Makes you straight,

Catch this nigga.

You're gonna be

Thank you for

Nigga, they took

Yo, that sucks.
Shit.
How we gonna

Man...
Niggas get jacked

You look fine to me, man.
Eat your Manchow.
And give me that shit!
You don't know how to roll
no goddamn blunt, nigga.
Hey, you got a hit in,
though, right?
Yeah, right.
Look at his face.
Nigga probably
handed 'em over
like a little bitch.
You know,
if I was up in there...
What?
Guess what I would have done?
What you would have done?
I would have been
all up on them niggas.
What?
One by one,
like, "What up?"
Like, what then?
What's up nigga...
Like, "What up..."
Chin up
Chest out when
it's flying time
Can't be a man if I
let another claim mine
They crossed the line
So, I'm with it
Don't approach me
Only real gonna survive
And we gonna see
That I ain't no bitch.
You deaf, nigga?
You don't hear
me talking to you?
Fuck you, bitch.
I'm right here.
You want me to

Shit, man.
Y'all need to chill.
Hey, I ain't fucking

That nigga's...
Albert's cousin, Trev...
He know everyone.
He set up everybody out here.
Come on in,
little homey.
So, what's up,
little bro?
What you want?
I was wondering
if you knew a guy
named Flaco.
Know where he at?
Why the fuck
would a li'l nigga
like you want to know
where a crazy
nigga like Flaco at?
He took my shoes.
Go get you some
more kicks, little bro.
You ain't getting them back.
What if he jumped you?
Erroneous. I wouldn't
be in your situation
in the first place.
LOOK...
Hit Ghost Town a few times,
and you gonna find him...
Bitch, shut the fuck up!
You shut up with
your old rude ass.
The fuck you know
where he at anyway.
Nobody was talking to you.
You should ask
your motherfucking
Uncle Marlon.
Don't he stay in Oakland?
He should be
the one helping you.
Y'all family and shit.
Come on, bro. Get up.
Look. Look...
Look, man.
Seriously, little bro,
don't think you can
just show up alone
like you did here.
For real.
Hey, girl, I know you

Let me get a dollar.
Man, leave
that lady alone.
Dollar, dollar,
dollar bill y'all.
Hey, B, what

Hey, bro,

Shut up.
Damn, man,
where'd you go?
This is too small, yo.
Yeah. XL. You know me.
I'm not buying you
no condoms, nigga.
Man, how you know
I can't buy my
own condoms?
'Cause you broke.
Man, fuck you.
You don't know my
financial business.
Damn, dawg,
your feet stanky.
So that's how it is?
You just ain't
gonna talk to me?
What you think,
you gonna get your
shoes back or whatever?
Not just fucking shoes.
They J's.
And you don't fuck
with another nigga's J's!
Shut up!
I would have
had your back.
Damn, nigga,

Yo, where we goin'?
He ain't gon' do shit.
Watch me.
Hey! Hey, yo!
Hey, bitch, where

Shut up, bitch!
Nigga, I don't

Yo. What the fuck

Look, man, we get it.

You crazy, man.
Look, bro, where

We gotta get

Yeah? All right.
Bitch-ass niggas these days.
I was a terror since
the public school era
Bathroom passes,
cutting classes,
squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was
a daily routine since 13
Chubby nigga on the scene
Used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce
In my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac
in my knapsack
Loungin' black
Smoking sacks up in Ac's
And Sidekicks
With my sidekicks
Rockin' fly kicks
Whoa.
You like them, bruh.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You sure you like them?
Yeah.
My Uncle Marlon
was a bad guy.
Not a bad guy like Magneto,
but, like, a really bad guy.
He got locked up
when I was little
for a long time.
I remember, when he was away,
I used to go to
my grandma's house
and play with my cousins.
There were three
of them, all boys.
I heard one of them
got killed though.
Hold up, hold up.
This is it.
This?
Yeah.
Man, why this nigga
got us in a trap house?
Hello?
Fuck.
Who are these
niggas on my porch?
Hey, yo, bro. That's our
little cousin, Brandon, man.
Man, I know
who that is.
Who is these
niggas on my porch?
I'm Albert.
Nice to meet you.
You a fat little fuck,

You got activator

Yes.
Ryan.
What's up,
little cuz?
What's happenin', man?
Shut up, bro.
What's up, cuz?
Where you been, bro?
I ain't seen you

My mom...
Yo, Gabe, bro...
Stop asking
stupid-ass questions.
Come on, man,
I'ma call him.
Hey, you think I'm fat?
What?
Shut up.
This water's

This my nephew?
You got hella big, boy.
That nigga's

Your mom

She all right, though?
Mmm.
These two with you?
I already...
I know.
And now I'm asking.
They're my friends.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, let's go
see your grandma
before we talk.
She still alive?
Yeah, man.
She don't make
no sense, though.
You shut the fuck up
before I kick you
out this house.
Come on, man.
Not y'all.
Stay with your cousins.
Hey, man,

My bad.
This a nice couch.
That's your cousin Drew.
He gonna look cute, huh?
Who's he?
Is you retarded?
I just said
it's your cousin.
Come on, man.
Oh, yeah.
Niggas trying to smoke?
Yeah.
Hey, Ma.
You got a visitor.
Your grandson.
Yeah. Liz's son.
Say hi to your
grandson Brandon.
Hi, Grandma...
No, no, no.
No, don't touch her.
She'll flip
the fuck out.
Hey, Ma, that's
your grandson.
You ain't seen him
for a minute, right?
Shit.
Wait for it,

They just
let him have it.
Sweet.
Just standing there.
Bro...
Look, look,

Right here. Look.
Boom!
Shit.
He got Falcon Punched,
nigga.
Goddamn!
I would have had
to pop his ass.
Hell, no!
You're mines, nigga.
So, what you
come here for?
I got into some trouble.
Your mama know?
Mmm-mmm.
She don't know.
What then?
You know
a guy named Flaco?
I heard he live
out here.
And I thought
maybe because
of what you do...
Oh, really?
What I do?
No...
I just thought,
'cause you know...
You out here,
and he out here,
and you might
know him.
You know what
Flaco mean?
No...
Flaco means "skinny."
He just a skinny,
little nigga like you.
You wanna know
his real name?
Yeah.
I bet you do.
What he do to you?
Take your girl?
Nah.
My shoes.
Oh!
Yeah, I know Flaco.
Fuck that little nigga.
He used to push for me
when he was, like, 13.
Smoked some of
my shit,
and went away
for a few months.
He deserve to
get his ass beat.
So, can you help me?
What? Help you beat
some kid's ass?
I'm a grown-ass man, nephew.
The fuck you thinkin'?
You know why
I went to prison?
Hmm?
I was cooking at the time.
You know what that mean?
Don't do that shit,
it's stupid.
I don't cook no more.
Anyway, I had this
big-ass batch to push.
And this nigga, Neil,
like a brother to me...
Grandma used to put
food on his plate,
we used to share
clothes and shit.
We started cookin',
making stacks.
And this nigga,
Neil, decides
he's too good for me,
and he don't
wanna share no more.
Tried snitching on my ass
on some little bullshit,
tried to take
the batch and go solo.
That's why you
went to prison?
Nah.
I found out,
and I shot Neil
in his fuckin' face.
Shit is wrong.
You got a problem,
you handle that
shit yourself.
Ain't nobody gonna
pull that trigger for me.
You gotta handle
your business yourself,
or get the fuck home.
But I just need...
Go on, man.
Get the fuck out.
That...
That bitch is rude, man.
Yo, that was fucked up.
What's up ...
What up, What up,
what up?
You looking for pops?
Shit.
Who the fuck is that?
What you doing
rocking them colors, nephew?
Black isn't really a color,
it's more of a neutral...
Man, miss me with
that bullshit, man.
He's nobody.
It's good, blood...
Hey, fuck

It ain't good.
I want to know who
this motherfucker is.
What now?
Man, sit yo

Yo, it's good, blood.

Or this little...
All right,

What's your problem?
Chill out. Chill out.

Oh, shit. Hey.

I thought I told you to

Come on, man.
Yo, I can't believe

Nah, he wouldn't help.
Yo, tell him.
Maybe he know

Chin checking full of respect
Gotta move as a threat
Daily be stressed
Round my way
I'm off the project steps
To the curb side at 13
I been cravin' cream
A gatekeeper
Them who understands
calls it Bay stream
Of blood flow
The girls love me
'cause I love dough
Keep the haze in my veins
and the dope burns slow
With my sidekicks
All of us on that fly shit
Ain't lettin' nothin' stop
I ride for my kicks
You ever been in trouble
with the cops before?
Figured.
You always been
too much of a pussy
to get in trouble
with the cops.
That ain't
how that works.
You such a man now.
Go on, be a man.
You wanna walk around
with a piece strapped,
starting shit
you can't finish?
That ain't how
that works, bro.
That nigga that
beat you is dead.
He got tossed
in front of a car.
And now Gabe got shot.
Over some shit you
started over some shoes.
How you get
your shoes back?
Flaco house.
Oh, snap.
Look at your big,
swingin' dick.
Maybe I was wrong
about you.
You gon' be all right
after all, shit.
You think so?
No, you probably
still gonna die.
At least you let
him know where you at.
Let me see 'em.
Yeah, boy.
Had me a pair

back in the day.
Go home now.
For real this time.
Wait.
You gon' need

You like those, J?
That's my boy.
Come on, J. Hold my hand.
Where we going now?
To get your shoes back.
But we just

and I like 'em.
That's not the point.
Just 'cause you
small don't mean
you let other niggas
fuck with you. Right?
Right?
You remember
that kid you let
come in our house,
take our shit?
Now it's your turn
to show him who
the fuckin' man is.
A'ight? You could
do that, J?
Yeah.
A'ight.
Don't worry, J.
I'm gonna help you.
Hey.
Can I play?
You're not worried
about your shoes?
I'm working on my
left right now, so...
I bought you guys
some stuff.
Bring any snacks?
No.
I got you some
protections.
Let me
see them shits.
Yeah. See, these are
the right size.
'Cause you know,
my dick is huge as fuck,
so like the other
kinds cut off circulation
around my balls and shit.
You're not supposed
to wear the condom around
your balls.
Shut up. You don't
have big dick problems.
You know this don't
change shit, right?
You don't got
nothing to say?
Yo, Rico,

Nah, nigga,
I don't feel like it.
Stupid, get stupid,

Go stupid, go stupid,

Come on,

Where you

From you.
Hey.
You ever

What?
Come on, nigga.
Spider-Man.
Okay, so you're

You ain't never

Let me tell
my story.
After you in the booty hole,
you know, from behind.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Anyway, so you

Right before you pull out,

so she thinks

But you really
busted in your hand.
And when the bitch
turns around...
What, nigga?
What, man?
Fuck!
Come on, J!
Hurry up!
Shit! Shit!
Go, go, go, go!
Come on!
Hustle!
He's right behind you!
I saw him.
Even when I dream...
I dream about getting chased.
Sometimes I wish
I had a spaceship.
Just hang out in space
where it's quiet.
And no one can fuck with me.
Fuck you, bitch!
Get up, nigga!
Bring that shit!
I dare you, nigga!
Do something else!
Get up!
Do something!
Get back down.
I dare you, nigga.
Do something else!

Oh, fuck.
Shit.
Come on, man.
Come on.
Shit, man.
That nigga

You all right, B?
Oh...

Flaco face though.
Lookin' like mine.

You a man now.
For real.
What we gon'

Same shit

I used to have the trey-deuce

In my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac

Loungin' black,
smoking sacks
Up in Ac's
And Sidekicks

Rockin' fly kicks
