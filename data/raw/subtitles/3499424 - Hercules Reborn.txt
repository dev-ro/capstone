MAGERA!

MAGERA!
[Hercules Yells]
MAGERA!
[Magera Whispers]
Shhh...Quiet.
[Cup Shatters]
What has happened to you?
Please no!
[Screaming]
[Hercules Screaming]
[Hercules Yelling/Sobbing]
MAGERA!
[Screaming]
MAGERA!
[Screaming]
[Grunts]
[Swords Colliding]
Not bad.
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
[Sword Colliding]
Cyrus: General.
Arias: Impressive.
You fight like a girl.
Ah, like a girl, huh?
[Grunts/Swords Collide]
[Grunts/Swords Collide]
Looks like [Heavy Breathing]
you just been beaten by a girl.
[Laughing]
Do you yield?
I yield.
Impressive, Horace.
Except that I lost.
No shame in losing to the best.
You arrogant bastard.
[Clapping]
Nothing wrong with arrogance...
as long as it coexists
with talent.
Which it does with you, Arias.
See my influence in every move
that you make.
Which is why, I am making you my
new captain.
You mean...
Yes! I'm promoting you,
my friend.
Thank you, General.
Scoundrel.
So, it's true.
And you said it was just
a rumor.
If we were all born leaders, then
there would be no followers.
Wouldn't you agree, Horace?
[Theodora]
Did I miss the match?
Yes you did, my love.
[Theodora
Who won?
I did, of course!
Well, tell her the great news!
Great news? Well, what is it?
I have just been promoted
to Captain.
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.
Alright you two,
save it for the wedding.
Forgive me, Horace. I didn't mean to
offend your prudish sensibilities.
Prudish? You should know me
better then that.
[Laughs]
So, the two of you shall wed?
Yes.
And as best man, I can only
say... she should be wedding me.
[Laughs]
Are you hungry?
My mother has invited you all
to a feast.
To celebrate our engagement.
Sounds delightful.
I will attend. See you then.
Horace.
General
Horace: Good riddance.
Arrogant aristocrat.
Theodora: Horace!
Arias: He's just jealous.
Please. Jealous of that donkey
in a General's outfit?
[Theodora Laughs]
He was born of a silver spoon
in his mouth.
I just don't understand your
blind devotion to Nikos.
How many times do we have to
speak about this?
Apparently, a few more until you
will listen to reason.
Queen: What exactly is
reasonable about conquering
a completely peaceful village?
If you want a reason to attack
Haon, I can give you thousands.
Millions.
King: The gold in their mines,
is that your reason?
Yes. Of course.
They're discovering
more each day,
and their people are growing
wealthier and wealthier.
While we--
[King Interrupts]
While we what?
Starve?
King: Is there not enough food
on your plate?
Unlike you, your grace,
I know what it's like to be poor.
And if we do not expand,
we will end up that way again.
I am not going to attack a village
and overthrow it's leaders
simply to attain its riches,
and to claim some things
that we have no right to have.
That gold belongs to whoever has
the might and will to take it.
To you.
To us.
We have to do it now,
while we have the power.
Queen: What power we have comes from
the fact that our people respect us.
That will work for us.
We risk losing everything,
for what?
A few gold nuggets?
Who are you to lecture me about greed
while you sit here on your royal--
[King Interrupts Yelling] Who are you
to talk to your Queen like that?!
Forgive my insolence,
your Highness.
This meeting is adjourned.
Leave now!
Gladly.
Am I interrupting?
Cousin!
Ah!
[Laughs]
Iona, dear,
a plate, huh?
Do not bother, Iona.
Thank you.
Erasmus.
I'm to have dinner with the King
and the Queen this evening.
I wouldn't expect you to dine
with common folk like us then.
I have news I wanted
to share with you both.
Theodora is not with child
already, is she?
Tymek!
Of course not.
I'm to be made captain
in the King's army.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
-I'm proud of you, cousin.
You know the army could use a man
with your leadership qualities.
You'd have to point a sword
at my back.
I'm quite happy where I am.
Isn't it beautiful?
Only rivaled by your beauty.
Arias.
Tell me.
Are you looking forward
to the wedding?
I think of nothing else.
Why would you even ask?
Well...I know men value
their bachelorhood.
Who told you that, Horace?
[Laughs]
Maybe.
Well, he is hardly
the expert on love.
[Laughs]
And what makes you an expert?
I have loved you
since I met you.
That is years ago.
And I am blessed
by the gods.
Nikos: We knew this day
would come!
Nikos: A day when we would seize back
our power and reclaim our kingdom!
King Demetrius is weak, and our
people have fallen into despair.
If he is unwilling to do anything,
then we must take control of our own fate.
We must stand together and take
back what is rightfully ours!
[Cheering]
Today...
We shall show our might...
And I shall lead Enos
into the future.
Know this, we must destroy
before we can rebuild!
Mercy is for the weak!
Brothers!
Take Arms!
[Cheering]
This is your destiny!
[Cheering]
[Chaos Outside]
What is that?
We're being attacked!
I have to find Horace
and the others.
And see what is happening.
Let me come with you.
No.
I'm scared.
It is far too dangerous.
Stay with your family.
Be careful.
I shall return soon. If for some reason
I shall not, you have to flee.
Go to my cousin Tymek's,
he will help you.
[Chaos]
Father!
What is happening?
I don't know my dear.
[Groans]
You two, run! Run!
Hide you two, hide!
Go, Go!
What's this?
I'm reliving you
of your command.
This is outrageous!
I will not allow that!
No.
I did not think you would.
Queen: Demetrius!
Queen: Demetrius!
The townspeople will never
respect your rule.
They do not have to respect me.
They will live by my rule,
or they will die.
I know what I choose.
Queen: Demetrius.
[Theodora Gasps]
[Chaos]
You!
[Grunts]
What on Earth are you doing?
These are civilians.
[Grunts]
Horace: Arias!
[Grunts]
Two against one,
that's not very fair.
[Grunts]
These are Nikos' soldiers.
Do you still think your mentor
is a man of honor?
I'm sure there must be
an explanation.
Then let's go find out.
Cut off their heads.
Hang them on the city gates.
[Theodora Crying]
[Screaming]
Princess.
Over the mountain, in the city
of Sagev...
Yes?
It is rumored that the man known
as Hercules resides there.
Hercules...
[Men Laughing]
Hercules again.
Arias, those are just stories
from our youth.
People have seen him.
People other then General Nikos?
Hercules has been known to aid
to those in need.
He has the strength of 20 men.
Maybe we could convince him
to join our cause.
[Distant noise outside the door]
Oh, Tymek.
Peace, Brothers.
-Have you got news from the castle?
-I have.
Although, you're going
to wish I hadn't.
It's the King and Queen.
-Alive?
-I'm afraid not.
The King by Niko's hand,
and the Queen by her own.
Treachery.
Their heads are posted on stakes
outside the castle gates.
And the Princess?
-She's alive.
-She's safe?
Afraid not, cousin.
Nikos has her.
She's being held captive.
That's it! With or without you,
I'm going in.
I will not allow it.
If you get killed, how does that
help Theodora?
Fine.
But then we're going to Sagev.
And we will find Hercules.
I'll go with you.
No! Tymek.
You stay with your family.
Gather as many men as you can.
Lead the resistance!
Keep the people's hope alive.
We're with you, cousin.
Good Luck.
All of you.
And to you, Tymek.
We're gonna need it.
Good people of Enos!
I am your new King!
Where is Arias Dudunakus?
Bring him forth and you will be
rewarded greatly.
If you do not,
you will be punished, greatly.
I assure you,
I am a man of my word.
Villager: General?
Sir?
Your Highness.
Forgive me, you Highness.
I have seen your man, Arias,
flee the village
with some other men at dawn.
Arias!
Show yourself, or I will spill this
man's blood as surely as I stand here!
Your hero has left you.
[Gasps/Screams]
Remember this day.
Remember this man's fate.
Do not defy me.
Horace: It's hard to believe
any Demigod would live here.
He's here.
I feel it.
He has to be.
Where shall we start?
Gentlemen.
By the gods...
I do not think there's any gods
in here.
Maybe not even half-gods.
He looks like a beast.
Ask him.
Perhaps he's the half god
you're looking for.
We're looking for a man named
Hercules!
And who might you be?
I'm Arias Dudunakus from Enos.
I'm looking for a man named
Hercules.
I have a handsome purse for the
man who claims to know him.
Anyone here named Hercules?
[Slurring]
I am Hercules!
[Slurring]
No! I am Hercules.
You?
Of course you are.
I am the real Hercules!
Now give me your purse.
[Crowd]
I am Hercules! I am Hercules!
At least you found your army.
I just hope your handsome purse
can afford so many Demi-Gods.
Bartender: Quiet you fools!
Spend you coins or go!
[Crowd Continues]
I am Hercules. I am Hercules.
Farewell, Herculeses.
It's been a pleasure.
Here she is, Dominus.
She's been cleaned as ordered.
-Leave us.
-Yes, Dominus
Sorry to put you here.
It's hardly befitting
of a Queen.
I will not hurt you.
[Screams]
[Slaps]
Never...!
...do that again.
You should know better
than to strike a King.
You are not my King.
[Whispers]
How wrong you are.
Just because you push me away does not
mean I will not take what I want.
You will pay for what
you have done, Nikos.
By the gods,
you will pay.
Your gods have no power over me.
They will strike you down,
but through Arias.
They will send him here
to end this and end you.
[Whispers]
Where is your Arias?
[Stern]
Where is your Arias?
[Yelling]
Where is your Arias?
I just know that he will return.
Yes.
He will return.
Not to save you.
Or his village.
Or even to kill me.
He will return to bow
at my feet.
He will bow at my feet,
and I shall have his head.
[Theodora Crying]
[Drunk Mumbling] That wench took my coins.
I saw you, you stinkin' whore.
I'll be back tomorrow.
[Grunt]
Don't come back until you've paid your
bloody debt, you filthy drunken dog!
[Grunts]
[Burps]
Take my hand, friend.
Get away from me.
You are drunk.
That I am.
Now leave me be,
before I...
[Vomiting]
[Burps]
Charming.
[Spits]
Lead me to Hercules, and I shall
pay your debt at the bar.
I am Hercules.
The fruit of Zeus's loins.
Now, give me some coins.
Arias, this man
is a worthless drunk.
This whole town is worthless.
Come, let us find some sleep
and be done with this
in the morrow.
[Burps]
We need to find Hercules
to fight General Nikos.
We'll find another way, Brother.
Hercules: [Slurring]
I am Hercules. I am Hercules.
[Aggressive]
I am Hercules!
I am Hercules!
Of course you are, friend.
Sleep it off, Hercules.
You know I've done you a favor.
Arias will never be as powerful
as me.
In time I will skill you,
in ways to love me.
[Gate Opens]
I said not to disturb me.
We know where Arias
and his men are.
They left for Sagev.
Send the regiment immediately.
Your Highness.
Don't worry...
You will love me.
[Theodora Crying]
You know nothing of love.
I know everything of love.
Everything I do...
everything I've done,
is for love.
You think me incapable.
It was once one I loved
so much,
when she chose another...
I killed her.
That...is how deep I love.
Iona: How where the mines today?
It's unpleasant work
under the best conditions.
But with Niko's men in charge...
They even refused us water.
[Man Screaming]
What's that?
They still seek Arias.
That's the sound of men being
tortured for information.
Is there anything
that you can do?
What would you have me do?
If I try to help,
they'll just torture me, too.
What if that doesn't work?
Your cousin's plan.
What if Hercules
is what Horace says he is.
A myth.
We cannot live
under these conditions.
Our son cannot grow up...
under tyranny.
Nor will he.
The traitors of Enos
are in there.
[Snoring]
[Door Opens]
Take the traitors to the street!
[Grunts]
[Crying]
You are lead by the wrong man,
General Nikos means only bad
for Enos.
Silence!
The gods are against you
today.
For the crime of treason.
General Nikos...
now...
King of Enos...
Hereby sentences...you to death!
You have betrayed Enos.
And for that...
you'll die!
Mount arms!
[Screaming]
[Yelling]
[Swords Colliding]
[Screaming]
[Swords Colliding]
[Grunts]
[Yelling]
[Laughing]
[Breathing Heavily]
I am Hercules.
I'm Arias. This is Horace.
What do you know
of General Nikos?
Ah, yes, Nikos.
He is the one we are after.
Or...
The one who's after us?
Depending on how you look at it.
He trained you, right?
Is that what he told you?
So, you know of him, then?
Let's just say I have more of a
reason to kill him than you.
Then you will help us?
[Gate Opens]
Your Highness.
It was ordered
that you must eat and--
By the gods!
Your highness!
[Gagging]
[Heavily Breathing]
[Coughing]
[Gasping]
[Cough/Gasping/Screaming]
[Knocking]
Princess Theodora.
Arias said that if anything bad
happened to come here.
Please, help me.
Please, come in.
Tymek!
Tymek!
Princess!
Praise the gods, you've escaped!
What's happened?
[Sobbing]
Where's Arias? I need Arias.
He's gone to Sagev.
-Why?
-To find Hercules.
[Sobbing]
You're safe now.
Arias will be back soon.
[Crying]
Horace: So, Hercules...
Horace: Why did you decide
to save us?
Hercules: I have my reasons.
Hercules: No one has asked
for my help in a long time.
Horace: Is it true
what they say?
Hercules: What do they say?
Horace: That you are
the son of Zeus?
Hercules: If I am, then he has
chosen to damn me to Hades.
[Urinating]
[Stumbling]
He's right back to being the
buffoon we found in the tavern.
You saw what he did
to Nikos' soldiers.
What he's capable of.
Sure.
When he didn't have access
to wine for a few hours,
he was actually capable
of standing erect.
[Gulping]
[Splash]
I do not know
what happened to him.
But the man he once was is still
inside him, waiting to get out.
He makes me nervous.
[Tymek Approaching]
Arias!
Cousin!
Horace!
What on earth
are you doing here?
It's the princess.
She's escaped.
But I bring bad news.
Nikos knows you've left.
He seeks you, even now.
He will see you dead.
He's already found us once.
We've been betrayed.
Don't judge the people of Enos,
Horace.
You have no idea
what they face.
Torture. Slavery.
Nikos is a monster.
And what about Theodora?
Safe for now,
but he will find her.
Nikos will not last.
I promise you.
We found Hercules.
So, the ledged is true.
You're best not to rest
your hopes on me.
[Burps]
Do not worry. He's a good man.
I know it.
I hope you are right.
Tymek, you need to go back.
Do not let Nikos find Theodora.
Without her, we will never gain
support of the people.
And you?
I have a plan.
Tomorrow, Niko shall die.
God be with you.
God be with all of you.
Good luck.
And to you, Tymek.
I look forward to see you
in a free Enos.
Yah! Come on!
Back to Enos!
[Door Kicked Open]
[Screaming]
[Crying]
No!
[Crying]
Where is Arias?
[Burp]
He must be dealt with.
Horace.
Why don't you try some of this?
What is it?
Water.
I am not bathing.
Hercules.
Why do you drown yourself
in wine?
[Burps]
Why do you care?
Just wish to understand
what happened to you.
The story I heard in Sagev is...
Well...
That you went mad
and murdered your family.
[Angry]
Never talk of my family.
No more talking.
Not tonight.
He's going to ride with us
into battle,
we need to know
he's dependable.
Have you forgotten that you'd be a smear of
blood on the ground if it wasn't for me?
Hercules!
[Horace Coughing]
Of course I haven't forgotten.
[Grunt]
[Sigh]
And I am grateful.
Horace!
[Horace Grunts]
[Breathing Heavily]
If we need to worry about you
intoxicating yourself with drink
into oblivion at the first sign
of trouble, it is better
we part ways now.
As you wish.
[Shoves/Thud]
Let him go.
Hercules. No!
[Grunts/Yells]
Are you pleased with yourself?
It is better there are
no unknowns.
This way we face Nikos knowing
exactly what we have.
[Footsteps]
What has happened?
Your majesty.
Look-look what she did to me.
She won't calm--
[Gasping]
You let her escape.
No one touches her but me!
Understand?!
Yes. Yes your majesty.
Go.
Sit down.
I will un-shackle you.
If you promise
to behave yourself.
I have a proposition for you.
No.
[Chuckles] You haven't even
heard what I was going to say.
The answer is still no.
I know you care about
your people.
I wanted to give you the
opportunity to relieve their pain.
Since when do you care about
the people's pain?
You think your father was such
a good leader?
He treated them with kindness!
Your father sent Enos into ruin.
Look around you.
The castle is crumbling.
Food supplies are dwindling...
If we had stayed on his path,
we would have all starved.
And you're better?
Yes. I am.
With the gold from Haon, we can rebuild
this place to what it once was.
We can be the envy
of all of Greece.
So fine, you have your soldiers,
you have Haon.
Take your gold.
The labor force has been...
uncooperative.
The villagers won't work
the mines?
Correct.
But you can tell them to.
And why would I do that?
I hate you.
I would rather die.
CYRUS!
Bring in the woman
and the child.
[Crying]
No!
Kill them!
Not the child! No!
[Screaming]
NO!
[Cyrus Grunts]
Theodora: No! Nooo!
Noooo!
Mama! Mama!
[Theodora Screaming- No!]
Child: Mama! Mama!
And the child!
Do it!
Nooooo!
Nooo! Noo!
Child: Mama! Mama!
Do it!
[Cyrus Grunts]
Theodora: Noooo!
Theodora: Nooooo!
[Crying]
Take them back
to where you found them.
I will not tolerate traitors.
[Crying]
What have you done?
[Crying]
You are a monster.
You will marry me.
And as my Queen who is loved
by her people,
you will have them
do my bidding.
[Crying]
I will kill one mother and one child for
every day that you do not cooperate.
This is your choice.
Kill no more. I do.
[Crying]
You're very loyal
to your people.
[Theodora Crying]
Tell me that you love me.
Say it.
[Crying]
[Crying]
I...
[Crying]
love you.
[Crying]
Iona.
Iona!
Iona?
Why is the door open?
Erasmus?
Where are you?
Iona?
Erasmus?
Erasmus?
[Sobbing]
No.
[Sobbing]
Oh, god, no!
[Screaming]
Noooo!
[Crying]
You're wasting your time.
I didn't come to talk you
into coming back.
Why did you join us
in the first place?
For Nikos.
What was he to you?
He always told us
he was your teacher.
Obviously, that was a lie.
He was my teacher.
But not in the way he claims.
Hercules, if you still have unfinished
business with Nikos, then nothing has changed.
We're still going after Nikos.
And you should, too.
It does not matter. Killing Nikos changes
nothing. The past is set in stone.
But the future is not.
Hercules, I see you
for who you truly are.
You're not a drunk,
and you're not a loser.
You're a great warrior
and a hero.
All you lack is the opportunity.
So you're doing all this for me?
How thoughtful.
I'm doing this for my love.
That is the difference between you and me.
I have no family.
And killing Nikos won't get
my family back.
You're wrong Hercules. When you saved
my life, you became part of my family.
My brother!
It saddens me
that you cannot see that.
I hope you find what you're
looking for.
I'm not looking for anything.
Maybe that is the problem.
[Horse Whinny]
Where have you been?
Trying to clean up your mess.
[Scoffs]
What else is new?
I shouldn't have said
what I said.
Yes, you should have.
You've been right all along.
A truly strong man is not afraid
to conquer his weaknesses.
And you still think Hercules
is truly a strong man?
I had hoped he was.
And you, Horace?
Are you truly a strong man?
Damn right I am.
Hercules.
Well then, let's fight together.
[Soldiers Approaching/Yelling]
It's an ambush! Stay together!
[Soldiers Yelling]
Aah!
[Chaos]
[Swords Colliding]
[Grunts]
[Whinny]
[Yells]
[Swords Colliding/Grunts]
Stay tight!
Hercules! Watch out!
[Swords Colliding/Grunts]
Aah!
Aah!
[Grunt]
Aah!
One's escaping!
Let him be, Horace!
Spear!
[Thud]
Cyrus: All but one of the 12 soldiers
we sent to Sagev, were killed.
The returned soldier brings word
that Arias Dudunakus lives.
I said I wanted him dead!
-My apologies.
-No matter what!
Find him!
How do you plan
to enter the gates?
On the east side
of the city wall,
the gates are opened 3 times
daily for couriers and traders.
There we shall enter in disguise
as merchants.
And how many men await us
at the gates?
2.
Maybe 3. No more.
Are you sure?
Arias and I served as sentries to
the gate when we were young men.
Your majesty? My apologies.
What do you have to say?
You already have failed
to kill Arias Dudunakus,
and for that offense alone,
I should take your head.
Sire, Arias Dudunakus is not
what concerns me.
They have a man with them.
He's the greatest warrior
I have ever seen.
He fights like the gods.
Like the gods.
Tell me more.
Well, your majesty...
I'm fairly certain I heard them
say he was Hercules.
Hercules.
I have heard of Hercules before.
I have heard that
he is half god.
I assure you,
he is only a man!
Indeed, he is a powerful one.
I fought alongside Hercules.
He's certainly no match
for you, Cyrus.
I'm certain they will return
to Enos.
Keep watch over Tymek,
Arias' cousin.
-Yes, sir.
-He will lead us to this half god.
What brings you to Enos?
I've come to sell my potatoes
at the marketplace
and a bit of coin for a pretty
night with some women and wine.
Open it up.
Its just potatoes.
You look as if I lied.
My potatoes! I've been robbed!
[Grunts]
Justice has been served.
Horace: We have all served
under General Nikos
And I'm telling you, the walls to
the Royal Palace are impenetrable.
Arias: I say retreat, find more men,
and return to fight.
Five of us against an army?
That's insanity.
Maybe I will have some
of that wine.
Maybe you should. You could certainly
use something to find your courage.
-That's certainly the hope.
-Enough!
We cannot afford to bicker.
And we cannot wait!
Hercules is right!
What's there to discuss.
Nikos killed my family. I found their
bloody bodies right there in their beds.
I will not rest until I see his
head on a stake!
Arias!
We have visitors.
I seek a man named Hercules!
Looks like the fight
is coming to us.
Then let's go shed some blood.
No! Don't!
We shall handle this!
How many men have you gathered?
30. Maybe 40.
The people's thirst for Nikos'
blood is rising, as is mine!
I am sorry about what happened
to you!
But your anger
will just get you killed.
I need you now.
The people need you!
Just go out the back and gather
as many men as you can.
They can do this.
You can do this!
Just rise!
We shall rise!
By the royal order
of King Nikos,
I hereby place you under arrest.
Surrender yourself, now!
Or die!
What shall we do?
You say the Royal Palace walls
are impenetrable.
Impenetrable.
I think we may have just found
our way in.
He's not talking about-- you're not talking about
what I think you're talking about, are you?
He is?
He is insane.
Hercules! Arias Dudunakus...
And your men,
surrender yourselves, now!
I am Hercules.
Take us to General Nikos.
Shackle them.
The mighty Hercules.
I was looking forward
to killing you in a battle.
Perhaps you shall have
that chance.
Hmm.
Perhaps.
General Nikos is not your King!
Do not let him take your freedom!
Rise! You are many!
They are but a few!
They have killed
your King and Queen!
In honor of them,
fight!
Spread word!
I said, silence!
[Slap]
[Screams]
Theodora!
You see this toy?
It's all I have left of my son,
Erasmus.
He saw slain by Nikos,
along with my wife.
He will do the same to you
if we do nothing.
I was like you once.
Afraid. Afraid to fight.
Afraid to risk my family,
but let me tell you, brothers...
That's exactly what you risk
when you do nothing.
Arias is right.
We have the numbers
in our favor, by a wide margin.
But you did notice that Hercules and
Arias have been lead away in chains?
We don't need Arias or Hercules.
We are the people!
This is our home!
Nikos will come for you next, and he
will kill your wife and your child.
But many of us will die, Tymek.
More will die if we do nothing.
And those that don't perish at the end of a
spear, will be enslaved in the mines forever!
The time to act is now.
By the gods!
Let's rise!
[Cheering]
[Grunts]
On your knees!
[Grunts]
I'm sorry it had to end
this way.
You should have joined me.
[Spits]
How long have you been planning
this?
I cannot believe
how blind I have been.
Unchain me now!
And let's settle this
as warriors.
[Slap]
[Scream]
-You're a fool!
-Do not hurt him, please--
Silence!
We must rise for Enos,
for your families, for your futures!
Rise!
[Cheering]
Rise!
Hercules, it's been many years
since our paths have crossed.
I do not speak to dead men.
But I am alive.
You are not long for this world.
[Slap]
[Grunt]
Leave him be!
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.
What are you talking about?
Hercules, once and for all,
who is this man to you?
[Angry Crowd Yelling]
Has he not told you?
I am the man
who changed his life.
He took Magera from me.
He stole my true love.
I loved her.
She never loved you.
I saved her from you and your abuse.
You kept her as a slave.
Hercules took my heart
and made me a fool.
Blood of gods.
It was unbeatable.
It was unfair.
You did everything in your power
to ruin us.
That's not all I did.
Do you ever wonder what
happened that night?
Do you ever wonder...
Why you killed your family?
I had a shaman of the Goddess Hara
make a potion...
not strong enough to kill you,
Hercules...
to drive you mad...
I wanted you to drive her away,
so she would forget her love for you.
You brought forth Magera's
blood and your children.
Is that what a real man does?
No!
Son of Zeus!
I will kill you.
I did not kill her.
You did.
[Grunts]
You are no god!
Now you'll see...
the true power of the potion.
Open his throat!
[Screaming]
Release the prisoners!
[Grunt]
We shall take this
to tournament!
[Grunts]
What have you done?
Hercules!
-It's me, Arias.
- I would take arms, if I were you!
Arias: Look at me!
It is I! Arias!
Horace: Why do I have a feeling
this is going to be bad?
Hercules, do not let the poison
overtake you!
This is definitely bad!
[Screaming]
[Echoing Woman Screams]
[Screaming]
Get back!
[Screaming]
[Growling]
[Yelling/Grunts]
You will suffer for this!
[Grunts]
Please! Hercules! Please!
[Snap]
[Screams]
When he's done with them, send in the
soldiers to take care of Hercules.
Yes.
Aah!
[Screaming]
Hercules!
It wasn't you.
It was Nikos that poisoned you.
[Grunts]
[Screaming]
No!
Are you okay?
Dariun!
Hercules! Try me!
[Grunts]
No, no, Hercules! No!
I'm Dariun! Your friend!
No!
[Angry Villagers]
[Growling]
[Echoing Woman Screaming]
[Grunting]
Aah!
[Thud]
[Angry Villagers]
Tymek: Take your city back!
Aah!
[Angry Villagers]
Aah!
Come on!
[Angry Villagers/Chaos]
Let him out!
Come on!
[Villagers in Chaos]
Come on!
Spit them out!
Spit out the demons!
[Vomiting]
Yes! Yes!
This is impossible.
[Vomiting]
The poison...
Get it out!
Hercules. Hercules.
[Hercules Burps]
Look at me!
Look at me!
Hey. Hey. Hey!
I need you Hercules!
Let's kill Nikos.
Let's kill Nikos.
Okay.
-Okay.
-Yes.
Nikos!
Come down here, and let us
finish this with blades!
What else have you got?
I have your Queen!
[Screams]
I will slit her throat
from ear to ear.
Drop your swords!
Bring in the soldiers.
Yes.
Soldiers!
Alright, Nikos,
we'll play your games.
Are you ready to die?
[Angry Villagers/
Chaos Approaching]
Some of Nikos' men
are changing sides.
We're winning.
We're doing it!
Well done, cousin!
[Angry Villagers Yelling]
Stay strong.
Time has reached end, Nikos!
You are outnumbered!
Hide behind her like a coward!
Attack!
[Screaming]
[Swords Colliding]
[Screams]
Let's settle this
once and for all.
Or are you too cowardly?
Your arrogance
serves you no justice.
[Screaming]
Aah!
[Grunts]
[Swords Colliding]
[Screaming]
[Theodora Screaming]
Noooo!
No!
[Screaming]
Noooo!
[Theodora Crying]
[Screaming]
It is an unfortunate ending
to your beloved.
[Coughing]
[Grunts]
Aah!
Aah!
[Crying]
You will not prevail.
[Slap]
Quiet!
[Slap]
[Grunts]
God.
Dies.
Aah!
Aah!
[Grunts]
[Screams]
Theodora!
It's a trap!
[Screams]
[Grunts]
Your perseverance surprises me.
[Grunts]
You have Hercules fight your battle.
[Grunt]
And your cousin
starts a rebellion.
Most impressive.
The people have spoken!
They refuse you as their leader.
They'd rather risk death!
So they shall have it.
[Screams]
[Grunt]
[Scream]
[Slap]
[Scream]
[Screaming]
[Grunts/Groans]
[Cracking]
[Chaos in background]
I am no god.
[Screams]
[Villagers Cheering]
[Screaming]
Aah!
[Screaming/Grunts]
[Swords Collide]
It's a serious wound, my friend.
I should just let you bleed out.
Aah!
[Screaming]
[Grunt/Groans]
The game is over.
Aah!
[Screaming]
[Slap]
[Breathing Heavily]
Cunt.
Aah!
[Grunts]
[Screaming]
[Theodora Sobbing]
Arias: It's over.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Crying]
Theodora: People of Enos!
You have remained loyal to me
and to your land.
You have fought to keep Enos
peaceful and free.
And I can assure you, it shall remain
that way for a long as I am your Queen.
Let us raise a glass to the man
who made this possible.
A man we all know by name...
Hercules!
[Villagers Cheering] Hercules! Hercules!
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!
Hercules...
I would like you
to stay in Enos,
become General to our new army.
I am honored to be asked,
but I cannot.
Why not?
I seek to build a future
of my own.
I want what you have
with Theodora,
a life.
I understand,
even if these men don't.
I understand.
Hercules...
I want to thank you.
I, honestly,
cannot thank you enough.
It should be I thanking you.
For it will always be you
who saved me.
Hail Hercules!
[Villagers Cheering]
Hail Hercules! Hail Hercules!
Hercules!
Hercules!
[Crowd]
Hercules!
[Cheering]
[Gate Doors Open]
Yah!
[Horse Galloping]
