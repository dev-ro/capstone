[ice crackling]
 (Female Voice): You ever
 wake up one day
 and realize nothing
 in your life
 is the way you thought
 it would be?
 (Male Voice): No.
 (Female Voice): Not even once?
 (Male Voice): No.
 Not even once.
 I knew from the start that
 life was pretty much all shit.
 (Female Voice): Oh my God.
 (Male Voice): God?
 God has nothing
 to do with it.
Welcome to Manila!
Enjoy your stay!
Want to dance?
 (Female Voice): I woke up
 that way this morning.
 Woke up and realized
 I wasn't who I thought I was
 or who I thought I would be.
 Not even close.
 And I didn't even realize
 until today.
 (Male Voice): At least now
 you know.
I am done with you, Got it?
Yeah, lower your voice.
Don't you shut me up!
Ow! Ow!!
(grunting and screaming)
(shivering)
Is it okay if we never see
each other again after tonight?
Uhh! Let me go!
[fighting grunts]
No!
[fighting grunts]
[coughs]
Are you okay?
Yeah yeah I'm fine,
I guess.
Good.
Buy you a drink?
[Dance Music]
¶¶¶
There you go folks.
My name is Bette if you need
anything else.
So who was the...?
Nobody important.
At least nobody who's important
any longer, yes?
[Dance Music]
¶¶¶
Want to dance?
I don't move so well.
You moved pretty well
out there.
Because it mattered.
[Dance Music]
¶¶¶
Ahhh!!!!
[grunting]
Here.
(grunting)
[bells tolling]
I've asked Alma to come
in every day from now on
to open the side chapel.
Did you have any problems
getting in?
No. No I didn't Father.
Thank you.
I've kept your situation
between us
as you've requested.
She was surprised you're coming
in every day.
God is our refuge and strength.
A very present hope
in times of trouble.
Psalm 46.
One of my favourites.
But how are you doing?
I.. I'm scared, Father.
Cast thy burden unto the Lord
and he shall sustain thee.
I have faith in God's strength,
believe me.
I do.
But I just don't know
about my own anymore.
 [phone ringing]
 Yes?
It's Deacon.
 It's been a long time
 my friend.
I'm in town and I need help.
 I am at your service
 without question.
 You know that.
 But..
But what?
 But nothing.
 Where are you?
The Golden Tree,
room 803.
 Can you speak
 over the open line?
I don't know.
 Then wait until I get there.
Hold on.
 Yes?
Can you get
some morphine?
 Um, yes, yes.
Thanks.
[children playing]
[knock on the door]
 Deacon! It's me!
How are you, man.
It's been a long time.
Good to see you,
my friend.
Who is he?
That's Nardo,
my right hand man.
What happened?
Oh my God.
Your kidney?
Probably, yeah.
They left money, medication.
Smart.
This way they can claim
that you sold it to them.
Yeah.
Where's Frankie and Julius?
They're gone.
It's been many years Deacon.
It's only the two of you?
Yep.
That's great.
[knocking on door]
Are you expecting someone?
No.
[knocking]
Let me go!
Let him go. He's my brother.
Deacon?
Go home, I'll call you .
What? Are you crazy?
George, you're not listening.
We have a delay. Just go.
A delay?
It's scheduled the day
after tomorrow.
You can't just postpone
this thing on a whim.
Okay what's going on here,
please tell me.
George, go home
I'll call you.
What's going on?
Okay. Here.
Oh God. No.
No.
I should have known something
like this would happen.
Whenever you're involved
something goes wrong.
Just go.
It always does, it always does.
What are you doing?
I'm not going anywhere!
Go home! Go!!
Deacon!
Let me get you a doctor now.
No time for this.
Just we have to go.
Did you get my morphine?
Yes yes yes, sure.
Here.
Great, thanks.
Ah.
I suppose there was a woman,
right?
There was a woman,
yeah.
British.
Maybe Irish.
An accent, dark hair.
I will check the security tapes
from the hotel.
How did you meet?
On the street.
Then she took me
to a club.
Which club?
Darlings?
Cabaret? The Vortex?
Vortex.
Are you carrying?
Not any more Deacon.
I have to be very careful
these days.
 Local police are no longer
 my friends.
These things happen in this part
of the world.
Perhaps it is best
if you just let it go.
Please, let it go.
It's mine.
I want it back.
Alright.
I'll do some digging
and I'll call you okay?
Nardo will be waiting
downstairs.
Hey, man be careful
and keep a low profile.
Here.
Here you go folks.
My name is Bette if you need
anything else.
It's my problem.
Stay out of this.
It is not just yours.
George, you're a teacher.
I'm a professor.
What do you think
you can do?
Whatever I have to.
How much time do we have?
Maybe 10 hours.
Until it goes to somebody else.
Then we should hurry.
How's your Filipino?
It's called Tagalog,
and it's better than yours.
I live here.
Whatever you do,
stay out of my way.
Deacon, what's the bible for?
Inspiration.
[dance music]
¶¶¶
It's the middle of the day.
How can it be full like this?
Places like this
it's always midnight.
The party never stops.
Hi there.
Your name is Bette, right?
Remember me?
(speaking Tagalog)
Okay she just says,
"What do you want
to drink?"
Oh come on.
She speaks English.
You know me, Bette.
Just hang on.
(Speaking Tagalog)
I was here with a girl named
Anna in this spot.
Remember?
(speaking Tagalog)
She just says she doesn't
speak English, alright.
She doesn't speak English.
See this Bible?
It will leave big bruises
and I will beat you with it
if you don't tell me
what's going on
and who set me up.
Arnel!
It's time for you to go.
You can walk out
or be carried out.
Your choice.
See, she speaks English.
I told you, didn't I?
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
[screaming]
[crash sounds]
[crowd screaming]
[fighting grunts]
[crash sound]
[fighting grunts]
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
[crowd screaming]
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
Book.
Come on, Deacon.
Now.
Deacon!
Now!
I warned you before.
Book will leave deep bruises.
Take a long time to heal.
Last chance.
Where's my kidney?
I don't know anything
I swear.
Please.
I'm sorry.
No!
No no!
Okay!
Okay. Her name is Anna.
Last name?
Riley.
Anna Riley.
Do you know where she is?
Gratis.
It's a fight club.
She said she was going
with Zoltan tonight.
Who's Zoltan?
Her pimp?
Sort of.
Yes.
Muscle guy.
Blonde highlights?
Answer me!!!!
No.
That was the other guy.
The one who came in
to pay me.
Drake.
I heard her call him Drake.
Can I go now?
Where's that fight club,
Gratis?
I don't know.
Where?!
It's an underground club.
They change the location
every week.
Just ask around.
It's the truth.
If you lied to me I swear
I'll come back.
I'll be in a bad mood.
[gasping]
So tell me.
Was this really necessary?
Plenty of blood spilled
in the bible, George.
Nothing wrong with
some blood spilled on it.
Deacon.
Deacon!
Deacon...
Wait! Deacon wait!
It's alright. It's alright.
He's a friend!
You're safe!
How did I get here?
Your brother brought
you here.
How long was I out?
Not very long.
This hospital, George?
Yeah, I know I know.
I didn't know where else
to go, okay?
They had a doctor here,
he's the kidney specialist.
Nobody knows you're here.
You're not even checked in.
Kung took care of that,
okay?
Your brother's a damned
stubborn man.
Listen, stubborn doesn't even
begin to cover it.
How do you know Deacon?
Professionally.
First we were
on opposing sides
and then on the same side.
You mean for the military
or what?
You do not know what your
brother does for a living.
We're not close.
I knew he had served with
the French special forces
but I don't know what
he's done since then.
Your brother is
a K and R expert.
K and R?
Yes. Kidnap and rescue.
He's someone that is hired
to bring back
a kidnapped loved one home
safe and sound.
You said you were on opposing
sides though?
Yes um...
What did the doctor say?
That I have a missing kidney.
Come on, let's go.
You shouldn't even be
on your feet.
He gave me some morphine.
Come on.
Listen George, when I was 22
with two broken legs,
I crossed the Afghan desert.
So compared to that,
a kidney missing,
it's nothing.
Come on.
I never knew that.
There's a lot you don't know
about me.
You have some info?
Yes, I do.
On the hotel cameras,
nothing.
Everything from that night
was erased.
Somebody got paid off.
But from the traffic cameras
I tracked you and the girl
from the club to the hotel.
Now here's a tighter angle.
Her full name is Anna Riley.
Can you track down her cell?
Sure.
With a little extra money.
Okay. Good.
Recognize him?
Yes.
Nearby camera.
He was watching you get
in the cab.
I have his name.
It's Drake.
At the private club where
she's working it's Gratis.
They change the location
every week.
Can you find them?
Sure.
Okay. What about weapons?
What?
Clubs such as Gratis will have
police protection.
Deacon, you can't just run
in there like a bull
in a China shop, kicking ass,
and shooting off guns.
You have one kidney.
The trail is getting cold.
We're going to lose them.
But you could still live
on just one kidney.
It's not worth the risk.
You didn't tell him.
Tell me?
Tell me what?
Here.
Come with me.
That's my daughter, Isabella.
She's nine.
She has focal segmental
Glomerulosclerosis.
It's, well it's kidney disease.
And it's progressed to chronic
renal failure.
Deacon's kidney was supposed to
go to Isabella two days from now
and without a transplant
she has less than three months.
If we don't get his
kidney back
before they put it
in somebody else,
my daughter's going to die.
That certainly puts things
in a new perspective.
I will make my calls.
First we'll see my guy about
tracking down her number,
and then the guns,
the hardware, okay?
What about more men?
I've made several calls
but I do not get immediate
responses like I used to.
How about the company
you work for?
I was supposed to be in Europe
but I walked away from a job
so I'm sure they're pissed
so I'm alone.
Okay, pull over.
There.
Okay.
Right there.
Right there. Right there.
He just jumped out.
Yeah.
Counter surveillance.
He'll be alright.
He's a pro.
How did you end up in this part
of the world?
Is your wife from here?
No no, Dutch.
She studied here as
an exchange student
and fell in love with the city
and just didn't want to leave.
How is she dealing
with this predicament?
My wife, Mary, she died
four years ago.
She was only 37 years old.
Breast cancer.
¶
Here we are.
I'll go see my guy
about her number.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
[cell phone rings]
Hello?
 (Deacon): Kung isn't
 answering his cell.
No. He's going inside to get
the girl's number.
 Damn it. Okay.
 Take the wheel
 and start the engine.
Wait wait wait,
where are you?
 Just do what I say.
Okay, just hang on.
Okay.
 Diagonally across the square
 there is a dark blue sedan
 between a truck
 and a small car.
 See it?
Okay just I...
Okay yeah.
Yeah, I do.
 Drive over there,
 not too fast.
 Pretend you're looking
 for a parking spot.
 Then stop exactly parallel
 to him, understand?
Okay, okay.
Just hang on.
You guys don't
look like tourists?
[fighting grunts]
[tires screeching]
[tires screeching]
Don't lose them! Go!
Faster!
Okay! Okay!
You're losing him!
Just let me do this!
Come on!
 What are you waiting for?
Okay, jeeze.
[tires screeching]
Pull up beside him!
But they're working
on the road!
They'll move!
Come on!
Don't slow down!
Don't fucking slow down!
Oh god!
[tires screeching]
Hard left!
Turn turn turn!
We're not going to fit
through there.
There's enough room.
There's not enough room.
There's enough room!
There's not enough room.
There's not enough room!
There's enough fucking room!
Come on, George!
[tires screech]
[heavy breathing]
Okay. Let's go.
(Speaking Tagalog)
Found the fights.
It's in a slum on the other side
of the city.
Is he asleep?
Yeah.
I don't know how he's stayed
on his feet this long.
So your poor daughter.
Will the transplant cure her?
The prognosis is good.
She'll have to be on medication
for the rest of her life
but she'll recover.
How could such a terrible thing
happen to an innocent
little girl?
With all the suffering
and injustice in the world
I sometimes think that God
must hate us.
You know what?
You're a kidnapper
and you're a criminal.
So tell me, what do you know
about God?
Perhaps nothing.
We are taught to thank God
for the good things
that happen to us.
Why then can we not blame him
for the bad things?
That's not how it works.
I don't hold God responsible.
If anything, I blame myself.
Or if you're like me,
you blame God and you
for Isabella's condition.
You do what you want.
But then again you've always
done that, right?
Enough!
Just remember if you had
been able to keep your pants on,
we wouldn't be in this mess.
We all have our sins that
we have to live with, alright?
You certainly have yours.
And I have mine.
¶
It's thrilling for the wealthy
to come down to the slums
and bet on the poor boys
killing each other.
It's disgusting.
Getting in?
No problem.
The fights are
an open secret.
They collect a fee
from anyone with money.
See those guys over there?
They are security.
Some are local police
on the take.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Keep the motor running.
I'm coming.
No.
 Not here.
[cheering]
Listen.
I'm sorry what I said before
about you being a kidnapper
and a criminal.
It's true I was.
At a very early age you were
taught about God
and I was taught darker things.
Wait!
That's him!
Drake.
[crowd cheering]
He's not picking up!
It's probably too noisy
in there.
Where are you going?
I'm going to warn him.
Here. Take it!
Be careful with that.
I'll keep trying him.
[phone rings]
Hello?
I'm so sorry.
Who hired you?
His name Drake.
That's all I know.
He's English.
Ex-SAS.
I know him from the club.
He was a customer.
He asked me to do it
for a price.
A big price.
$30,000 American.
How did you get in touch
with him?
I didn't.
He called me and his Caller
ID was always blocked so, look.
It was only for the money.
I wanted the money so that
I could buy out my contract
with Zoltan and get out.
Out of the club.
Out of this life.
I didn't realize what
I was getting into.
I didn't think that...
I've done things for money.
Things I am not proud of.
But something like this?
It sickened me.
 Anna?
Zoltan doesn't know,
please.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm just a friend.
Friend?
I know all her friends.
But I don't know you.
So you're no friend.
I'm not a pimp either.
Anna!
Stood me up baby.
I had to GPS your cell
to find you.
Don't.
Same for you Zoltan.
Stand down.
Anna?
What the fuck is going
on here?
Who are you?
Definitely not a friend.
You screwed up Anna.
We were supposed to meet me
and then disappear
for a few weeks.
Now Deacon here has found you;
that's a problem.
Mr. Deacon Lyle, my client
wishes to make you an offer.
How much for you
to walk away?
When what's mine
is returned to me.
You amuse me.
Now let me paint this picture
for you.
This lady is a professional
escort.
One who you were seen
with last night
in a less-than-reputable club.
Anna? Behind my back?
This gentleman is her pimp.
Also an officer of the peace.
Obviously unhappy.
Recognize this pistol?
Your weapon Deacon.
I got it from your suitcase,
it has your fingerprints on it.
This is what happened when
you turned up here tonight
and found them both
here together.
[gunshot]
Her pimp, an undercover
police officer shot dead
with your gun.
Now walk away and I'll give
you 24 hours
before I turn over all this
evidence to the local precinct.
I don't think so.
Your choice.
Walk away live, stay
and you die, she dies,
everybody dies.
Listen my client wishes for less
mess and bloodshed
but it really makes
no difference to me
so what's it going to be?
It's your choice.
You're going to tell me
where my kidney is.
I'll make it quick for you.
If you don't,
I will cut you in pieces
until you talk.
Deacon I have no orders
to eliminate you man
but if you keep pushing...
 Stop.
Done my homework, George.
You're a devout Catholic.
You're not going to kill anyone.
Where is the kidney?
Tell me.
Put the gun down George
and walk away.
Now.
Or I'll make your little girl
an orphan
without thinking twice.
Tell me where it is.
It's too late George.
The kidney already
has a new home.
It's in, it's over,
walk away.
He's lying, George.
They need me in case
of a fuck up.
Then they'll take
the other one.
My other kidney.
Okay in less than an hour,
I won't have any of you.
[gunfire]
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
Ahhhhh!!!!!!!!
[crowd cheering]
[fighting grunts]
[crowd cheering]
[crowd cheering]
[gunfire]
[crowd screaming]
[gunfire]
[gunfire]
[gunfire]
Flash bomb!!!!
 Get down!
[explosion]
In my professional opinion,
we are screwed here.
Dead gangsters.
Dead police.
You have no damn idea of
the nightmare we're headed for.
We're marked men, Deacon.
We have to leave
the city now.
We let it go now,
Isabella dies.
I'm not going
to let her die.
Who's Isabella?
She is my daughter.
Deacon's kidney was supposed
to go to her.
Kung, did you hear something
from your guy?
Yes, he finally agreed.
We bring the body to him,
he removes the kidney,
packs it in ice,
and we're good to go.
Wait, the body?
You're going to kill whoever got
the kidney?
 You can't do that.
Yes we can.
Of course we can.
What are Isabella's chances
if she goes back on the list?
George.
Why can you not just
give one of your kidneys
to your daughter Isabella?
Because I'm not a match.
We tried all of our
close relatives
and Deacon is the only one.
He's a perfect match.
Deacon's a match
and you are not?
That's the situation.
No wonder you two
aren't close.
Alright.
There is the question
of money.
My doctor friend has a price
of $20,000 American.
Look Deacon I don't have
that kind of cash on hand.
Do you?
George, what about you?
For God's sakes, no.
I do.
Here.
It's the money they paid me
to set you up.
Take it please, I don't want it.
Use it to help Isabella.
Thank you.
Okay there's still the matter
of finding the kidney
and we have no idea of where
it is or who has it.
Okay, think about it.
A rich old man
needs a kidney,
I mean desperate right.
And he knows he's on
the bottom of the list.
So he's hiring somebody
to find out who at the top
of the list is a match,
and that's Isabella.
Yeah they probably paid off
someone on the hospital staff.
They were watching her.
So when Deacon went
to the hospital
for the prep test yesterday.
Yeah.
They ID'd me as the donor.
Bango.
Bango?
We need the list.
Whoever matches Isabella
is our guy.
I am familiar with such lists.
It's impossible to get to.
Hard but not impossible.
How do you know this guy?
From the university.
 (Deacon): How do you know
 he can do it?
 (George): He can do it.
He owes me.
That's your guy?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Don't worry.
I can do this.
Who was that you drove
up with?
That's just my brother,
Deacon.
You have a brother?
I didn't know that.
Shocked I was receive such
a request from yourself.
As you know I'm a simple
honest janitor these days
in this lovely old theatre.
I have this, you see that?
I'm limited to one block around
my house and my work.
And if I'm caught even
near a computer
it'll be straight back
to jail
to serve out the rest
of my sentence.
You of all people know this.
I do.
And if memory serves me
correctly,
you made me promise to repent
and sin no more
in exchange for your testimony
for my early release.
I did.
Look. Can we do this?
I can do it.
But I worry about what you
might think about me
breaking my promise
to Jesus, my saviour.
My daughter Isabella,
she's on the recipient list.
I didn't know that.
George. I owe you.
So listen to me.
You don't really want
the list.
Yes I do.
No you don't.
You think you do,
but you don't.
What are you talking about?
What do I really want then?
What you really want
is the name of the person
who first tried to hire me
to hack the list.
Am I right?
Someone else tried to hire
you to hack the list before us?
Yes.
With almost the exact same
specifications.
I said no per my promise to you
but in light of the money
they were throwing around,
I have no doubt they eventually
found someone else.
Okay. Listen to me.
I really need to know
who tried to hire you.
Are you sure about this?
Please.
Okay, well, this will be
our little secret.
I managed to get
on a computer,
did a little digging around.
Thank you.

Okay okay, and what is this
Harmony Corp?
The rather ironically named

is one of the largest suppliers

Private military.
You mean mercenaries?
Well, that would be
the less poetic term, yes.
Harmony Corp.
Lord in heaven.
They are connected
to everyone.
 They've got deep pockets
 that's for sure.
Listen, we need to find a place
to regroup.
A hotel, something.
Our summer house.
It isn't far from here,
you know?
We could go there.
Few people know about it.
Summer house.
Summer house, okay.
[cell phone buzzing]
It's Liam.
That kid's amazing.
He actually managed to hack
into the system
and get us the plans
to Rants' villa.
I'll go print them out.
Okay.
Please just make yourself
at home.
Thank you.
That's George's wife?
 But she looks just like me?
There's a reason why Drake
chose you.
Your brother's wife?
How could you?
 We both loved Mary probably
from the first time we met her.
 I knew her first.
 I was in high school
 with her in Amsterdam.
Our Dad is Scottish, French
and my mother American.
They divorced.
When we were very young
and I went with my father
and I grew up in Europe.
 George lived in the States
 with my mother
 but he came over in the summer
 to visit Papa and me.
 He met Mary through me.
 Later he came to university
 but really,
 it was to be with her.
So I was the bad boy,
you know?
Gang, street fights.
As I got older it got worse,
more violent.
I could not stay out of trouble.
[deep sigh]
Not even for Mary.
She chose the good boy
instead of the bad one.
I didn't understand then.
Just too damn proud I guess.
I was a real bastard about it.
Ten years ago George and Mary
did have a problem,
they separated.
She and I spent time together.
But she went back to George
and I can't blame her for that.
After all, George is a good man
and me, well,
I really am a bastard.
 And that was it.
Until she found out
she was pregnant.
And she told him the baby
was yours?
 She didn't have to.
Because George knew he couldn't
have children.
We had tried for years
and, well it turned out
I'm sterile.
But you took her back?
You forgave her?
Of course, yeah.
I loved her.
It was easy to forgive her.
Forgiving my brother
on the other hand,
that was much more difficult.
I'm going upstairs to rest,
alright?
(screaming)

Have faith.
C4 here and here.
And we also need
radio transmitters.
He's good for it?
Yes, yes.
He has everything
that you ordered.
But Deacon we have a real
problem on our hands.
Once again, we have hit
a financial wall.
The money the girl gave us
has all been spent mostly
on the doctor.
The new equipment has to be
paid for up front.
We need $50,000 American
at least.
Deacon.
I have just been thinking
about this
and I have been praying
and we can't do this.
Whoever has the kidney now;
we cannot kill someone
for the kidney.
Please no more killing.
We have to stop.
I knew you would do this.
It's wrong. Everything.
We can't.
I'm not letting her die.
Not tonight.
Her fate is in God's
hands now.
No, it's not in God's hands.
It's in our hands.
Yours and mine.
No, our hands they are
bloody enough.
Okay? So no.
No more. It's over.
It's your fault.
It's your fault she's as sick
as she is George.
You waited too long
to have her checked.
Don't you do this.
Don't you do this.
She hated going
to the doctor right
because it reminded her of
what happened to her mother.
And after Mary died I could
not bring myself
to make that child do anything
that she hated.
There's more to it than that
George.
No. That's all there is.
Bullshit.
I think that you're
punishing Isabella.
Don't do this.
Oh yes, because there's part
of you that hates her.
Please don't.
Because every time you look at
her she reminds you of me.
No!
She is my daughter.
I am the one that
she calls Daddy
and you have no idea how much
I love that child.
I love that child more than
anything in this world.
She's going to die tonight.
Would you give your life
for her?
God, of course I would.
Yes, your life.
But not your soul.
Would you kill to save her
even if it damned your soul?
Kung.
I have the money you need.
There's plenty of money
in this account.
And the password,
is beloved.
Please, take it.
I wasn't going to touch
that money anyway.
It was from Mary's
life insurance.
We do this together,
we go all the way.
No turning back George.
Clear?
I am clear.
If I am going to go to hell,
I might as well go down
in flames.
Good shot.
Good chops.
It's something I should have
done a long time ago.
He's right. He should have.
I'm embarrassed to ask
but can I have some of that?
Yes. Of course.
Of course.
I love coffee.
I'd drink it in my sleep
if I could.
 Yeah my wife Mary
 she felt the same.
Ah!!
The smell of good coffee.
Need to fuel up.
I talked to the ammunitions guy.
He'll be ready for us
in an hour.
We should start getting ready.
I have a good feeling
about this.
We'll get through this
and then Isabella is going
to be just fine.
It's amazing.
Once you have money
to throw around
people start returning
your calls.
I need some milk.
Listen, Deacon about before.
Did you put that there?
No, I don't know what it is.
Stay away from the windows.
Anna, kill the light.
Kung, don't!
Don't!!!!!!
[explosion]
George!
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Was it... was it Drake?
Let's find him.
Let's find him.
Kung's guy will be here
any minute.
Kung never got me any help
only equipment
which means it's only
you and I.
Are you okay with that?
Yeah.
I run the op from the field.
You run ammunition
from the back.
No time for debate.
When I give an order,
it's a go.
Clear?
Clear.
You sure you can do this?
Yeah. I've done it before.
More than once.
Kidnap and rescue
is all fine.
But what I'm really good at?
It's killing people.
It must be hard.
No, that's the scary thing.
Killing it's easy.
Living with it,
that's hard.
Okay.
Okay charges are all set.
The charges will take out
the power,
cameras and the alarm, okay?
Yeah.
No. 1. Watch the screen.
You'll get the video feed
from my camera.
You'll see everything I see.
And I'll come out
and break the gate.
With the door open, I'll jump
in and you hit the gas.
You don't stop.
Got it?
Got it.
Now, Anna.
Yes?
Hey? What the hell?
Deacon Deacon!
Make sure George doesn't go
into that house, no matter what.
Okay?
Yes.
Stop it.
Here's the key.
George, it's better this way.

[gunfire]
(screaming)
Where are those lights from?
I don't know.
Backup generator?
[gunfire]
[gunfire]
He took a hit.
What do we do?
It's got to be a hit to the
head because the camera's out.
Wait wait wait.
[gunfire]
Okay there's still firing.
Okay that means
he's still alive.
I've got to do something.
Give me the key.
Look I promised I wouldn't!
Give me the key!
I can't!
I promised I wouldn't!
I can't! I'm sorry!
[gunfire]
[gunfire]
[explosion]
[gunfire]
Have you ever handled a gun?
My Dad...
our Dad took us hunting,
once.
Wait...
May God forgive me.
(whispering): The Lord is my
shepherd I shall not want.
he leads me beside
the still waters.
He restores my soul.
He guides me in paths
of righteousness
for his namesake.
For I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil.

Simon Rants?
Yes.
Time to go, pal.
The police are on their way,
unfortunately for you
you'll be dead by
the time they get here.
Let's go.
Nice try Deacon.
How do you doing, mate?
Hand me the weapon
over your shoulder slowly.
I never imagined you would
find out who I was
much less where.
It seems that Drake was
right about your tenacity.
He was certain you'd be a
problem for us eventually
and now here you are,
in my home.
I wanted to avoid any killing
if at all possible.
I'm a guest in this country
after all.
You leave me no choice.
Which for you lover boy means
it's time to say au revoir.
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
(praying)
[gunshot]
He was right.
It's all too easy.
[fighting grunts]
[fighting grunts]
UGH!!!!!
You know what the hardest part
about this job was?
The part where I had to pretend
that you chased me off.
Step away from my brother.
Aaargh!!!!
Now!
Can you really do it George?
Can you kill a man
in cold blood?
[gunshot]
Shoot him in the head.
Shoot him in the head!
Fucking jammed!
George.
I told you to walk away.
That's enough Drake.
Are you ready for round 2?
I already won the fight.
All the blood on the floor?
It's mostly yours.
Femoral artery.
You're bleeding out.
Game over, game over.
Okay, okay.
[coughing]
Get up.
I want my kidney back.
Come on!!!!!
Wait wait wait wait.
As old as he is,
he doesn't look near in
the pain that you are.
Something's not right.
There's no transplant scar.
You're not Simon Rants.
It's a decoy.
Where is he?
Where is Simon Rants?
I am Simon Rants!
I am the man
you're looking for!
Look at the pictures
on the wall!
My university certificate!
I tell you I am Simon Rants!
Take my kidney,
whatever you want!
I'll cooperate.
Believe me please.
I'm telling the truth.
He is Simon Rants.
He's not Simon Rants III.
What?
It's got to be someone else.
The name on the recipient list
was Simon Rants III.
We have to keep looking.
Let's try the master bedroom
next door.
Wait. Wait!!
[grunts]
Don't you move.
Please. You don't understand.
Please. You can't do this.
He's only 11 years old.
You can't disturb him.
He's at a delicate stage
in his graph!
Don't hurt him.
Please, take me.
I'm dying anyway.
Shut up!!!!
George. George!
He's my only grandson,
don't you understand?
He was dying!
And I had to do something!
I get it, alright?!
But since there's a dying little
girl waiting for that kidney
then you will understand
what I have to do.
No!
George!
What!
You cannot do this.
This is too much.
We cannot cross this line.
We don't have a choice.
Don't do this.
George!
Don't do this.
Don't pull the trigger please.
Don't do it. I beg you.
Don't do it.
George.
What would Mary think?
[sobbing]
It's okay, George.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay, brother.
What happened?
He wasn't there?
He was there but
it's not happening.
But what about Isabella?
She's so beautiful George.
 We can't just let her die.
It's in God's hands now.
I'm sorry.
I don't think I've ever heard
you apologize to anyone before,
you know that?
Here.
Want to hold her?
Huh?
Hold her.
No no no that's okay.
No come on.
It's alright. It's alright,
Deacon.
You sure?
Yeah yeah, I'm sure.
Just try not to wake her,
okay?
There we go.
She's really something, huh?
Daddy? Daddy?
It's okay.
It's okay pumpkin.
See this fellow right here,
you know who he is?
He is your uncle Deacon.
Uncle Deacon?
From the pictures?
Oh, yeah. The one and only.
This is the surprise I was
telling you about.
I'm so sorry it took such
a long time
before I came to see you.
I love you.
It's time to go to Daddy.
I've always wanted
to meet you.
Me too.
I know you from the pictures
and Mama talked about you.
Yeah, your Mama was a
special person you know.
She was beautiful like you.
Okay listen you know what.
You just got up so you know
what you have to do.
Yeah, bathroom.
I know.
Let's go. Come on.
Deacon, were you cut?
Have you been bleeding
all this time?
This much blood?
 Uncle Deacon,
 can't you stay?
I would love to but I've got
to go, baby!
I've got to go.
Deacon just hold on.
I'm going to get a nurse
okay.
George, you're such a good man.
My other kidney.
Put it to good use.
Deacon, please.
Please do this for me.
Let me give the other kidney
to her, come on.
No, D.
No.
I'll go get you a doctor.
George, I'm dying.
I'm dying George.
You're such a good person.
Come on Deacon please.
Deacon please,
I forgive you.
You don't have to.
Oh George.
Feel good.
 Uncle Deacon?
Isabella listen just give
your Daddy
and Uncle Deacon a minute okay?
We're going to talk about
some grown up stuff okay?
I'll be really quick.
 Dad, come on!
 I want to talk to him!
 Dad!
Nurse! Nurse!
 Dad!
Here you go.
Is Mama watching us
from heaven?
You always ask that.
Of course she is.
Is Uncle Deacon watching us
from heaven?
I sure hope so.
I really do.
Let's go.
