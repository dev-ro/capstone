Freddie!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Should we go in?
No, no.
No, just let her get some rest.
...temporal lobe where
most of the damage took place.
Due to the hematoma
and the CNS pathways
being affected,
there's been an onset
of Aphasia.
Sorry, it's just, uh...
It's a lot of words now...
really know what
any of them mean, so...
I don't think things are ever
going back to the way they were.
Some choices need to be made
for us to move forward.
Okay.
So, um... I mean how...
How much time
does she have, then?
We'll know more
in a couple of days.
Is there any hope of her
memories returning?
Well, in theory,
every experience
we have in our lives
is stored in our
brain somewhere.
Identifying patterns
in past data
to predict trends
in future data
is how all successful organizations
make beneficial decisions.
And that's what we do here
in data analytics.
Inventory levels, employee break times.
It could be anything.
It is all just patterns
for us to identify,
quantify and label.
So I see here
a bit of schooling in...
Visual Arts?
Yeah, I... That's, um...
Dreams of youth, I guess.
Fred got a new job!
You should tell her
about it, Fred.
It's really great.
He's doing really well.
She's not gone, you know,
she's still here.
Yeah, no, I know.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Fuck it.
Hello?
Hel...
Hel...
Come on.
Obey...
Prison...
System...
Language...
Fred...
Cindy?
Don't let me go.
Fucking asshole.
What?
Fred.
Yeah?
What are you doing?
Uh...
Nothing, just...
You know, organizing.
In the middle of the night?
Yeah.
And so
our portal-based software
will enable a new level
of granular metrics.
Essentially, we need to
anticipate our clients' needs
to know what they want
before they do.
Now, we to understand
how they think before they do.
We need, in effect, to be...
The Art Spirit.
What?
The Art Spirit by Robert Henri.
You borrowed that
your senior year
and it was never returned.
Oh, oh. Okay, uh, yeah.
I could see-see
what I could do about that.
How do you even remember that?
I remember
little Freddie Fitzell.
And, yes, I do remember
Cindy Williams,
due to her, well,
um, troubles, you know,
attendance and whatnot.
So, I've been having
trouble tracking her down.
I haven't been able to find
a single trace of her
since graduation.
Well, that figures.
She never turned up
for final exams
your graduation year
so she didn't graduate.
She just vanished.
Of course, that was the time
when that awful drug
went around the school.
Lost a couple students to it,
if I remember.
What was that
horrible stuff called?
Uh, Mercury.
It was called Mercury.
I was thinking maybe we could
knock down the wall
between the spare room
and the closet.
Maybe make a walk-in
or a home office.
Eventually a baby room?
You know who I saw today?
Who?
Mrs. Shouldice.
Remember, from Fairgate?
Do you believe it,
she's still there?
Where'd you see her?
Uh, I went by the school,
actually, um...
I don't know, I guess I was
feeling nostalgic or something.
What?
Nothing, it's just
a little weird.
You wanna choose one?
Sure.
Um...
No, we are not having
a purple bathroom.
It says medieval wine.
Why? Goes with the curtains.
We could be like
the couple that matches
their bathroom stuff.
Anyone talking during
the test will receive an automatic zero.
Anyone getting up
from their desk
during the test
will receive a zero.
Anyone looking
at someone else's paper
will receive a big, fat zero.
Miss Williams?
Are you with us?
Talking. Moving. Looking.
Zero.
If you do not
do well on this quiz
it means you have not familiarized
yourself with the material.
Which means you will probably
fail your final exam,
not graduate high school,
not find gainful employment,
which means it will be
very difficult for you
to entice the woman
of your dreams.
Mr. Fitzell, have I connected
D to C to B
all the way back to A,
which is where you're sitting,
in a way that is sufficient
for you to understand
the significance of A?
Yeah.
There's your girl.
You'll have 60 minutes.
And begin...
now.
Mr. McDonald, could I go
to the bathroom really quick?
When you've finished
your test, Mr. Fitzell.
Finished!
Hey, man. You got them?
Come over here.
Thank you.
Lobby.
Lobby...
Language...
...your.
...your.
What?
I'm in... your... lobby.
What the fuck am I doing?
Fred...
It's all right.
Fred, stay with me.
Do you hear me?
Stay with me, Fred. Fred.
Fred! Fight!
Fred, fight! Get off of him!
Let him go!
Fred, fight!
- Fred!
- Fred! Don't let me go.
Fred!
Hey.
You're okay.
Jesus, what happened?
Fred?
She's ready for us.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Look who's here!
Hey, Mom.
How you feeling?
Wow, what's all this?
Janice has been helping
her organize her photos.
Those my old drawings?
Oh, wow.
Ma, hey, you remember this one?
Remember?
The little yellow house?
I always said
I wanted to live in
an all yellow house
when I grew up.
It's okay.
Come on, Freddie.
Time to clean up your crayons
and brush your teeth.
Come on, buddy.
Put them all away.
I don't want to.
Freddie,
Santa knows which little boys
listen to their mothers
and which ones don't.
You want Santa to bring you
presents or coal?
Freddie!
So, we're all moved into
our new apartment.
You should tell her
about it, Fred.
Here, take this!
Hide it! Hide it!
Look, man,
they won't suspect you.
Hey!
Look, I know it's really hard
to see her...
Just stop, she...
She doesn't know who I am.
She's gone,
she's-she's already gone.
Motherfucker!
Shit, man.
How long has it been?
- Thirteen years?
- No!
Yeah. I can't believe you were
at your mom's when I called.
- I didn't expect that.
- No, man, I live there.
Mm, fuck, really?
Yeah, man. You know, I got
all my creature comforts there,
and it's just a stone's throw
from my "office,"
- So, you know.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
It's so crazy
seeing you, man.
Yeah. You too, man.
I can't even remember how we lost touch.
No, me neither, man.
Me neither.
Well...
Let's get fucked up.
Hey, I'm so glad
you called, man.
So, you really...
You didn't keep in touch
with Cindy at all
after graduation?
Aw, you kidding, man?
I forgot that chick
as soon as I could.
You, on the other hand,
I'd never forget.
It's just...
I've been remembering things.
This one night, you, me, Cindy,
when we were on Mercury...
What the hell was that shit?
Who knows?
You don't remember anything
bad happening to her?
Man, that shit was strong.
I couldn't remember
what happened the next day.
You think I'm gonna remember
that shit now?
Hey, I'll tell you
what I do remember:
the first time you tried Merc.
Do you remember that?
Yep. How could I forget.
Janitors gotta get high too.
Andre, Cindy, this is Fred.
Fred has a talent for being in
the right place at the right time.
I just hid the bag.
It wasn't a big deal.
Mm-hm. Well, it's time
to stop hiding it.
- It's time to stop hiding it, Fred.
- Oh, shit. Sorry.
Here's your reward.
You've never done Merc, huh?
Merc? Uh...
No, I just stick to weed mostly.
Mm.
- I smoke it a lot.
- Mm. Hm-hm.
Hey, man, once again,
right place, right time, huh?
Could you just
stop fucking talking?
Move.
Don't worry,
it's not even pure Merc.
Cut with other shit, diluted.
Yeah, when are we
getting the real stuff?
- Soon.
- Oh, what...
What does it do to you?
Hey...
Don't let anything
influence you.
Make a choice yourself.
Well, what do we do now?
Sit back... enjoy the show.
You shouldn't have
given it to him, Sebastian.
Look at him.
He's fine.
What?
You're doing good.
There's so much to explore if you
don't succumb to pleasure or fear.
Are you following me?
Uh...
No, no. I don't...
I mean, I...
You're either coming with me
or you're letting me go.
Which one is it?
I'm coming.
I'm not your tour guide.
I don't take it to be like them.
I take it to explore.
Explore where?
Anywhere but here.
Wait, wait...
I'm sorry.
My mind's just wandering.
Your mind is wandering?
- Sorry.
- It's fine.
You're drawing again?
No, no, that's, uh...
Not really.
Just, uh, some illustrations.
How's the job going?
Karen, relax. It's just
a couple of drawings, okay.
I just asked
how the job was going.
Nothing for 13 years,
now I can't get rid of you.
I can't believe
you still live here.
Listen, my mom's having
a little nap, so, shh.
Oh, I got a little
surprise for you.
No shit. Andre?
Sorry.
It's good to see you, Fred.
Dude...
It's good to see you too, man!
Holy shit!
Oh, Andre, man, what's going on?
How you been?
Well, um, married,
two kids, two and a half.
Jenny's pregnant again.
Wow, Jesus. Shit.
What about you?
I'm an information analyst
right now, so...
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, old times, huh?
Old times.
The play has been overturned
to an incomplete pass.
Cindy? No way.
Uh, she hasn't even
crossed my mind in 15 years.
What about her friend,
what was her name?
Laurie something, I don't know,
but you think maybe
she kept in touch with her?
Man,
wherever she is, she's fine.
That girl never needed anyone.
Why are we even
talking about her?
Sebastian? Honey?
Oh, shit. Well, she's up.
- Sebastian!
- Yeah, Ma?
So, what's this whole
Cindy thing about anyway?
I don't know,
it's just been, um,
I've been remembering
things recently.
There's just one night
we were on Merc.
And I can't just sh...
I can't shake the feeling
that something...
something bad happened to her.
You know, and we all forgot.
Man, that whole time back then
is just "shew"... You know?
Hard to make heads or tails
of any of that.
Have you studied at all?
What?
Have you studied yet?
Hey, what the fuck
you talking about?
For final exams?
You don't understand
what I'm saying?
Hey, Fred.
Yeah, hi, Fred.
Look at these two already.
All right, you crackheads,
let's go.
I got to meet my guy.
How old are you?
Old enough to know this place
is a piece of shit.
I'll meet you out back.
Where we going?
What if they catch us up here?
They don't.
What?
I was just realizing that...
I don't know if we've ever
had a conversation
where we weren't on Merc.
It's like you only exist
when I'm on this drug.
What are you looking for?
Why is it so important
for you to explore?
I don't want to be like them.
Locked in a prison
that they forgot
that they're in.
What prison?
Look at all of them.
Running around.
Pretending they know
exactly who they are
and why they're doing
what they're doing.
They-they don't
have a fucking clue.
None of it matters.
All they're doing is...
giving things labels.
Giving inaccurate names
to things that are
infinite and unknowable.
This is your name.
This is your house.
This is your language.
This is your job.
Labeling every
little thing,
even the fucking label-maker.
And then they look around
at their world of...
utterly meaningless labels
and say...
"This is our reality."
That prison.
But how do we break free, then?
We?
Are you following me again?
Uh...
Yeah.
We have to remember
the power that we have.
The power of choice.
The power
of every single second.
The power of... now.
Now.
Now.
Well, they're probably
looking for us.
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, calm down.
Get her on her side.
Choosing...
Life-form... Which...
Shape...
Gold...
Hey, man!
Whoop.
Massive score. It's in.
How'd you like to do pure,
uncut Merc.
They said we could get some
at, uh, this place...
next week...
...if we drop by.
This is it.
This is how it happens.
- Fred?
- Yes, um...
What are you doing?
Uh... What am I...?
Um...
Dreams of youth?
Yeah, that's, um...
Sorry, what's, uh, up?
What's up?
Are you ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
Tomorrow, yes, the Q2
presentation, of course. Um...
- Yeah, um, I'm getting there.
- You're getting there?
Yeah, I'm almost...
It'll be...
- You're almost ready?
- Yeah.
- Whoo.
- Could I steal you for a second?
Sure, okay.
I am sensing a lack of focus.
Also, you have been late
three times this month.
If it happens again, there will
have to be consequences.
Sorry. Sorry.
Um, no, I know,
I'm trying to, uh...
I understand. I'll be better.
You have to present
your Q2 report to the board.
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow.
- Mm-hm.
- Nine AM.
- I know.
- Are you going to be ready?
Yeah, I'm gonna be ready
for tomorrow. Mm-hm.
Is that... Are you...
Is that all?
Jesus, man, what?
I remember.
It... It was
right before final exams.
Those weird fuckers
I used to grab off of...
told us we could get uncut Merc.
Yeah, you're sure
Cindy came with us?
I don't remember this at all.
I don't remember any party
or any...
Then why the fuck are you here?
Okay, can either of you guys
honestly tell me
you ever remember seeing
Cindy after that night?
We gotta go back.
We got to go back.
We gotta... we gotta try to remember
what happened to her that night.
We gotta retrace our steps.
We gotta remember.
So, where did we go that night?
It was a...
It was a building,
it was like a...
old broken-down building.
Blackbird street.
It was on Blackbird Street.
No time like the present?
No time like the present.
Do you know
where the fuck we're going?
I know where we're going!
Here we are.
Well, we saw it.
Guys...
Fred, no!
There's absolutely
no reason to go in there.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Squatters.
What?
Fucking bums, man.
This is it.
This is where it happened.
I can't go in there.
I-I can't go in that room.
Okay. It's all right.
You guys stay here.
Let's leave.
Now. Let's just go.
What do you know?
You know something,
I know you do, tell me.
I don't know. I just...
I know that
we're supposed to be here.
Well, well...
Hundred percent pure.
Shall we?
Fuck. Let's not stay long.
What are you doing?
Stop pulling my ear.
Stop.
Okay, okay.
Fuck it.
Jesus, Andre, what the fuck?
Listen to me, listen to
me, listen to me, listen to me.
Don't...
Don't-don't take it, okay?
- What?
- It's not what we think it is.
And then
they're-they're everywhere.
They're all over
the fucking place
so we have to get
the fuck out of here.
Who? Who are you talking about?
The-the bums.
The fucking bums
are in the fucking building.
- Okay, we got to, we got to go.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
You got to breathe. Okay?
- Take a fucking breath.
- Oh, oh, shit.
Shit, Andre.
What the fuck is happening?
Fred, Fred, okay,
just-just whatever you do,
just don't take it,
whatever you do.
I already fucking took it, okay?
What's going to happen to me?
Huh?
Andre...
Oh, shit, it's already
fucking happening to you!

And...
Not a thing in the world.

How much Merc is he on?

A lot.

He's just a kid.
He's no more a kid
than you are an old man, man.
True...

What are you all
still doing here?
We never left.
Neither did you.
Fred...
Here is still here.
No...
No, no, no. No!
No! No! No!
No, I need help!
Tell them I need help!
I took too much!
It's okay, Fred.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're here. You're really here.
Fred, I understand...
I understand what the Merc
is doing to us.
I thought I was back here...
here.
I was older...
It's not a matter
of one point being real
and the other not.
All points exist simultaneously.
Try a small transition at first.
Concentrate on your
experiences here.
In this place.
Memory...
Are you talking about memory?
Concentrate...
Oh, shit. It's already
fucking happening to you!
Oh, my God.
It's not a memory.
It's still happening.
No! No, no!
No, I don't believe it.
What... What do you want from me?
Fred.
This is only one of my lives.
One set of choices
and I exist in all of them.
Simultaneously.
I'm more free
than you could ever imagine.
I've seen the skylines
of a thousand cities.
I've looked into the eyes
of a hundred grandkids.
The ones that I love the most,
they look like you.
Come with me.
I'll show you
all the possibilities.
How?
Go with him.
He'll show you the way.

Color...

Misinterpretation...
On...
The system you are using
to interpret reality
is not one of your choosing.
Numbers. Language. Color.
Shape.
All a misinterpretation
of the information around you.
A misinterpretation
imposed on you
by an invasive life-form
that is trying to control
your consciousness.
The substance you ingested
temporarily counteracts
the influence
of the invasive life-form
that is trying to force you
to perceive information
in the same manner as itself:
in a linear fashion.
To perceive choices
as having inescapable outcomes.
Outcomes it has dictated to you,
thereby controlling all of your choices
and, in effect, eliminating them.
It achieves this goal
by influencing you
to perceive the most elaborate
of all misinterpretations...
Time.
Fred.
Fred! Fred, it's all right.
Stay with me.
Do you hear me?
Stay with me, Fred. Fred.
Fred! Fred! Fight!
Get off him! Let him go!
Fred, fight!
- Let him...
- Fred...
Fred!
Get the fuck off of me!
Fuck you! I'll fuck you up!
Fashion...

- Force...
- Hey, come on, Fred.
Come on. Let's go!
Fuck. Come on, let's go!
Fred, come on!
Hey!
Fred! Fred.
Fr... Fred! Jesus Christ.
It's okay.
Did you take something?
Hey, hey, Fred.
Hey!
Please.
Fred?
Honey?
Are you all right?
Fred!
Open the door!
Are you all right?
Shit, shit, shit!
Shit, shit, shit.
Freddie.
You're not gonna say anything?
About yesterday?
You have finals today.
Do you know
how important that is?
To your whole life.
I don't even know
who you are anymore.
I'll be right there.
Anyone not at their
desk in the next ten seconds
will receive an automatic zero
on their exam
and will not be graduating.
If you think I'm bluffing
I encourage you
to test that theory.
All right, you will have
60 minutes beginning...
now.
...that specialize in
a multitude of areas of business
so you can be
absolutely sure that...
Fred Fitzell!
Yeah?
Could you present your Q2 report
to the board, please?
Now?
So, we can see from...
from the previous six quarters
we can estimate that this...
Q2 numbers...
The Q2 numbers, uh...
An invasive life-form
that is trying to force you
to perceive information
in the same manner as itself:
in a linear fashion.
Mr. Fitzell!
Fred!
I can see it.
Why are you even here right now?
You've always been here,
huh, haven't you?
Where, where, where?
I can feel you.
I'm in your prison
right now, huh?!
Aren't I?! I can feel it!
Now.
Now!
None of this fucking matters!
I didn't choose
this fucking life.
None of you fucking move!
Get him out of here now.
Get him out!
I'll get my fucking self
out of here!
I'm not even here!
I'm not even here right now!
I'm not even here right...
now.
Be right there.
Be right there.
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Bellamy,
is Sebastian there?
He can't come
to the phone right now.
Okay, okay, when do you think
he'll be able to, uh...
He can't come
to the phone ever.
What? What do you mean?
I don't want you
around my boy anymore.
- Goodbye.
- Fred! Fred!
What is going on?
The entire board is waiting inside.
Now.
- Yo.
- What's up?
- Have you seen Cindy?
- No.
Do you know if she
left with us last night?
Dude, did she leave the
fucking party with us or not?
I don't fucking know!
All right?
You gentlemen
have somewhere to be?
Where does she live?
What?
I said "Do you know
where she fucking lives?"
Why are you asking that?
Why do you...
Why do you care so much?
Let's go!
Now.
I don't even know
who you are anymore.
Now.
Freddie!
Freddie!
Freddie, come back!
Freddie!
Stop!
Fred.
I'm still here.
You'll always be here.
I thought you
needed me to save you.
But it was you
trying to save me.
Now.
Where do you want to go?
Everywhere.
You finished another one.
You hear what I said?
We're almost out.
I'll go out soon.
I got you something today.
What is it?
It made me think of you.
Now it'll make me
think of you too.
It's okay.
I'll find it again.
Hi, Mom.
I know you don't
remember me but, uh...
I'm your son.
It's you...
It's you.
Freddie! No!
No!
Freddie?
What?
Freddie?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is you here?
This is you.
Yeah...
- It's you?
- Yeah, it's me. It's me.
It's me, it's me.
It's me.
Fred.
Cindy.
I can't.
I can't follow you anymore.
I know.
How do you think you did?
I think I gave them
what they wanted.
I'm Karen.
I'm Fred.
Mom?
Mom?
Freddie.
We don't go out there, right?
Remember what
happened last time?
You remembered!
