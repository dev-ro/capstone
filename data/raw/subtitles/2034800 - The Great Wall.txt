We have to turn back.
We have been riding for six months.
And we've lost 20 men.
But we survived.
Yes. By chance.
Any one of us could have met that same fate.
We were the strongest.
Remember why you're here.
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I would have to kill you.
At least here, we have a common goal.
RIZZETTI: Oh, yes.
This black powder.
It turns air into fire.
And kills a dozen men at one time.
It is the weapon of our dreams.
And what if it's just a myth?
Men have sent word that it's real.
And those men are dead.
And we are next.
We have no maps,
no medicine
and no food.
No one is going back.
We take inventory of what we have left
and finish what we started.
TOVAR: There's not much here.
The moon is strong.
When the horses are fresh, we move.

If they keep after us,
we'll kill them in the mountains.
The magnet.

I can use it to make a compass.
Rizzetti won't make it.
The wound is festering.
We'll be dragging a corpse.

He's earned the right to die where he wants.
I've been left for dead twice.

You killed a Tao Tei scout.
You killed it alone.
You're correct.
We are under siege.

You saved the west turret.

What about us?
Pace yourself.

I hope not to stay that long.
I like your thinking, but I suggest
you keep your plans private.
You aren't the first Westerners
to come here looking for black powder.
We'll discuss it tonight. Bring your partner.
How long have you been here?
Always.
I was not five years old when I came here.
I have no other family.
We're the same.
I was given to an army before I can remember.
As a soldier?
Worse. As a gleaner.
Packs of children,
we'd clean the battlefields.
After, when the fighting's over.
I became a page, a pikeman's boy...
For your country?
No. I fought for food.
You fight to eat.
You live long enough, you fight for money.
How many flags do you fight for?
I don't know.
I fought for Harold against the Danes.
I saved a Duke's life.
I fought for him until he died.
Fought for Spain against the Franks.
Fought for the Franks against Boulogne.
I fought for the Pope.
Many flags.
We are not the same.
Meet me on the Wall.
I have something to show you.
He should be careful with her.

Whether or not the cable is attached,

- (WILLIAM CHUCKLES)
And the answer?
(SPEAKS IN MANDARIN)
(STUTTERS) Xin ren.
(IN ENGLISH)
Xin ren means trust. To have faith.
Here, in this army,
we fight for more than food or money.
We give our lives to something more.
Xin ren is our flag.
Trust in each other.
In all ways, at all times.
Well, that's all well and good,
but I'm not jumping.
I'm alive today because I trust no one.
A man must learn to trust
before he can be trusted.

There are many weapons here.
Why have we not seen them?
(SIGHS)
There are many things you have not seen.
And many things you should pray
will not be needed
before the siege is through.
The Tao Tei will return.
When the drums call to battle,
the guards leave their posts
and take their positions on the Wall.
That is our moment.
We want to be riding away
as the battle rages.
And the armory doors? You have keys?
I have black powder.
Enough for several doors.
He brings us in. We get us out.

As you fought, where was this stone?
In my bag.
Its unseen force is powerful.
I believe this strange stone could help us.
We try everything.
Where are the Tao Tei now?
STRATEGIST WANG: The mountains, regrouping.
Where do they come from?
About 20 centuries ago,
there was an emperor whose greed
brought deep suffering to all of China.
The heavens sent the meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain,
turning it green and releasing the Tao Tei.
From that day on,
the Tao Tei rise every 60 years
to scourge the north of China.
They come to remind us of what happens
when greed is unchecked.
They eat anything, alive or dead,
and take food to their queen.
She depends on her soldiers to feed her.
Only with the food they provide
is she able to multiply.
The capital, and its two million people,
is only 800 li away.
If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourishment,
no corner of the world would be safe.
You can't hunt them?
Men try.
They disappear.
We never find their bones.

A little slow.
You're a hero after all.
Well, it looks that way.
You seem pleased with yourself.
And what are they giving you
for all of your troubles?
A bag of gold?
A victory parade along the top of the Wall?
All the black powder I can carry.
And a cavalry escort to get me home safely.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
So what is this?
You're here to rub my nose in it?
Well, would you blame me?
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.
And the time before that, I saved your life.
True.
You know, the Emperor gave me a choice.
I could take the black powder,
or I could take you.
Please tell me you chose the powder?
I don't even know you anymore.
(CHUCKLES)
The horses are saddled and waiting.
Best we ride before nightfall.
I'll be inside.
Don't leave without me.
I came to say goodbye.
I understand congratulations are in order.
General of the northwest territory.
That's quite an honor.
Seems you've made your choice.
Him?
Believe me, I'm already thinking about
trading him back for the powder.
- (CHUCKLES)
- TOVAR: I heard that.
Perhaps we were both wrong.
We are more similar than I thought.
Thank you, General.
(HORSE GRUNTS)
Are you sure you don't want to go back?
Of course I do.
I just don't trust you
to make it out of here alone.
(TOVAR LAUGHS)
