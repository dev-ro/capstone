There was no light, colleague,

work.
With this accident,
Must act quickly,
without any hesitation.
It exits the routine.
What if I make some tests
?
Okay,
if necessary.
If I get.
But I'm not rich.

To have faith.
In these moments of sadness and pain.
Give us the courage.
Amen.

I thought you amused.
Ah, yes, yes... thank you.

The sagento, Bill Cotter,

Very good at his job.
He said he mentioned something ...
On a light at the time of the accident
.
She said you were in shock.
If I had led,
George would be alive.
This is not the first time.
A year ago
I killed an old
with my car.
I hit him,
I hit my death.
Was accused of manslaughter.
I did pay.
Now I can no longer drive.
Pedestrians age

Good morning, Mr. Waldo.
Follow me to the town hall.
Why?
The mayor would like to speak with
you before he left.
Arthur,
I'll be honest with you.
I'm a simple man
And I do not like to go to rodeos.
What I say, I say it
that I love you.
Arthur,
You're very sick.
The doctor came to see me.
I spoke to you in medical jargon
But I think it's better if we talk
simple.
The main thing is to have clear
You is normal.
But that will not work
while avoiding reality.
The doctor spent almost all night
Analyzing the results of their tests.
What did he say?
I'll be claro.Usted has two dead
on consciousness.
And that fear of driving
And cars.
Here in the hospital in Paris
In Hall Bellevue,
We have people who do not know
or what it's called.
It is true.
It occurs in hospitals around the country.
Accidents leave
brain injury.
Even if there are no physical consequences.
people who can not drive your suffering.
As you.
I know it's not very nice,
I understand.
But so,
It is a world of cars.
I do not know what your financira situation.
But the doctor said
I could work with him
as a nurse.
Could get the help they give you
Or through the door and leave.
Is your decision.
Good morning.
This is our waiting room.
Full of people waiting.
If someone comes and brings something, you give me.
At the end of the week
as income in the bank.
Here are the stretchers
'll show as open.
Excuse me ma'am, I teach
Arthur using stretchers.
Do you come with me, please?
You should always see you busy.
Ten  always something to do.
Remember.
On this side, we have the rooms.
Over here.
Everything will be fine.
At all times.
Now he goes away.
The doctor is the one who gives the orders

Is important.
And I give orders to you.
And there are patients. Mainly
The car accident,
the rest.
- The rest?
- If.
They suffered such serious accidents
Brain with mush.
Not think it's good
You have contact with them
During your hours on duty.
As Leslie.
Was bank manager.

Do you want a cup of tea?
Come on.
Do not trust.

Is believed to be a bank.
You will give the orders.
're In luck. The caravan
saved you.
She cushioned the shock.
You saved my life.
Before many caravans passed through here.
The other type ...
It was my brother George.
What state he was?
I was in a state
Worse than others.
What do you mean?
Have you seen someone with
foot instead of your nose?
Do you want a cup of tea?
Arthur?
What happens?
I will not work more in the hospital.
They told me about George.
I was not your fault.
He took care of me.
Was the one who encouraged me.
I did not want.
In fact, he hated me.
He said it was weak.
Len says I'm weak.
That's what makes m
Impossible to have children.
.... Hillary and Janette are not our children.
Are orphans.
An accident.
Let children
pick up their toys,
Time to go to bed and passed.
Are not you going to give
goodnight to Dad?
-
Good night - Good night, Dad.
Did you find a place to stay?
I thought I could stay here for a while.
You can not be serious.
You must take it.
Clive
you staying in the moment Pub.
I saw those lights
night of my accident.
Really?
Good night, Arthur.
Good night.
Good morning.
Sing the anthem 407.
Hi, Charlie.
Sit down. Let us ask.
On the way I was offered an invitation
For dancing
Pioneers Paris.
It will be a very exciting afternoon.
I think it's a good idea
make a masked ball.
As you know, I have two hobbies:
The past
Which is wonderful in our land,
And the future that lies in our youth
.
I would be delighted to see one here
Sunday after the dance.
It is an excellent idea.
Our young people are able to free themselves a little,
And share with us the parties
our glorious past.
However, issue a critical
As a newcomer.
Your road.
It is a danger.
Rails and holes
They should be a thing of the past.
- What do you think of the service?
- Wonderful, as always.
Do you have a moment?
Do you still here?
Thought had gone.
I have to talk something with you.
I would, but I have no time
.
When then?
Within four days, okay?
According .
Do not worry, I'll help.
Thank you.
Just call me.
Janette, remove it from the car.
- Do not come back?
- I told you remove it.
Suba, Arthur.
I have to tell you ab,
Seriously.
I have a wonderful family.
The best.
They have taught
be sincere and honest.
I would talk the other night.
The other night
When I saw Janette.
I realized that something was missing in our family
.
A son.
I felt... How could you say
?
I wish this were
same for you.
Because, after all....
Family that it is.
And Beth,
She is delighted with you.
I'll have to vigilrle.
What I want to do...
It is to be installed here at home
And become a member of our family
.
From my family.
Mean...
What you stay with your family?
That's right.
According .
I never had a real family.
There is one thing that makes families together
,
Do not talk to strangers
As Ted Mulray.
They keep their things for them.
The next issue is the guard of parking.
- Guard parking?
- That's.
Think of the future,
we must be prepared.
As the pioneers who settled in this land
.
We must take initiatives.
- How to handle the parking
- Yes.
It is an important job.
The man who will handle that should clean this city
And make a decent site
For people to park.
There is only one man for it.
And Arthur Waldo.
He came here.
Is an orphan.
He came here.
For help
And day and today
Has decided to stay between us.
I created
A symbol
This charge...
Come on, Arthur Waldo.
Have you heard anything?
No.
It's all I could tear down.
What happened?
Does your fence Fell?
We have cars, we do not want
advantage.
I drive on the rims.
What if we split tires?
That would not be bad,
some music...
- Arthur Hi, how's it going?
- Whose car is ete?
It is mine.
You need to move,
you can not park here.
- Who said that?
- Mayor.
You have no right.
No one forces you.
According .
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hello, Arthur.
Do you all right?
You do not want to be a nurse?
I got a new job.
Officer parking.
He indicated
where people can park.
Do you think you could....
... Move a little?
No problem, buddy.
So it is doing well?
They say you had a brother.
What happened?
George slammed.
You should have printed too.
You should be dead.
It seems that hates cars.
Is it true that you hate?
Would you like a ride
me in the car, buddy?
You'll do nothing at all.
Who was at home
mayor, last night?
I do not conteis stories.
They spoke of coiled hedges.
Must dismiss this worm.
Then we talk about that.
Come with me and we'll talk a little.
Is it not to say
aparquemos not here.
A strange
should not tell us what we can do.
That's enough,
talk at the station.
And move their cars!
You say that this type
is exceeded?
What about you?
've Gone too far.
Estais really damaged.
Look at this.
The doll mayor.
Halved.
Okay, everybody out.
That's my car!
What do you do?
What are you going to do?
Let your legs!
Calm down!
Let this be a warning.
A warning to all those
Who they want to skip the Paris law.
Forward, Max.
You can not do that,
it is my car.
You're crazy!
Band assholes, assholes
, I hate you!
Come, come!
Get that, quick!
I found it.
's Mine.
You killed the pastor.
You hate God?
- Take him!
- Gather them away!
Piece of bastard!
It would have to bury the car.
I must report the accident.
That's no way.
Shut up, you idiots!
You heard me ?,
Shut up!
Max
Closes the door and no one leaves
.
I never did anything wrong.
You always stay with the best.
I have never done anything wrong.
Never.
Listen to me.
Hear me!
All.
Remember that an accident has occurred.
A hunting accident.
Mr. Metcalf ?.
There was a hunting accident.
Can she say that?
Repeat.
There was a hunting accident.
Bravo. That's.
'd Better finish,
have not finished my work.
I can not go faster.
I have to consider my career
.
Your career?
What a job!
You're as sick as us.
I have enough of your experiments
!
Take your experiment to hospital!
Well, enough, Len.
Come on, buddy.
Come joke, we fatigues.
Hurry up.
Max, closes the road,
not enter or leave nobody
Until we fix this mess.
Neil, dancing

Scrapped the car and get rid of him.
What you hope?
A hard day,
But we have already passed.
What do you think of the suit?
Beth spent half a day
prepar√°ndotelo.
I'm not going to dance.
Why?
I have much to ponder.
I think too much.
Pienss to go?
I can not stay.
I'm restless.
Are very good.
They are like George.
Basta. Listen to me.
Get this through your head.
No one leaves Paris, no.
So put the suit
And you see the dance.
Jim, shut the door, will you?
Place yourself on both sides
to hear the speech. That's.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pioneers friends
This afternoon will be both sad and happy
.
As you know, Reverend Ted Mulray
He has died in a hunting accident.
A cruel twist of fate
that does not deprive of their presence.
But I feel it's here,
Us tonight.
The early pioneers had to suffer adversity
And they passed the test.
It was a hard life.
Only furtes survive
And the weak perish.
The future will be splendid,
Here
In our village.
The light is at the end of the tunnel.
But you have
Force
To cover
The road ahead?
I think most of you
you have it.
Have you forgotten
Our guys the old war cry?
Do you Olvidasteis
meaning of those words?
Road closed?
What is the problem?
Are the cars.
They want revenge for the burning cars.
That's no problem, you know
to do.
- I place traps
- That's right.
Bravo, it was very beautiful.
Make room for youth.
It's your turn.
Back!
I have one.
Get out of the road!
You have to bring all patients.
To you Arthur,
Go there. I am behind you.
Come, you lame.
Do you have the chips?
Move. All back.
Step back.
Come, I hope.
Dale!
You were lucky.
Try to catch me.
My leg! Do not!
Dale!
Back, back.
Let !. Ahead!
Now.
I drive.
Stop!
No one should drive,
There traps
On the outskirts of the village.
No one can enter
Or leave.
No route is safe.
Paris
Survive.
No one will die
Until further notice.
Les,
Brings the car.
You understand me?
Meteos inside.
Arthur.¬°Vuelva !.
Arthur!
Get out of that car!
