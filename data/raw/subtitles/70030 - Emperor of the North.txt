Easy. Easy. Easy. Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it right there.
Spout it okay?
Okay.
- How far down?
- Just about half.
- Three quarters is enough.
- Okay. Three quarters.
- Almost there?
- It's just about three quarters.
- Let's get her goin'.
- Okay.
Ready to go, Shack.
Goddamn bo.
All right. Bring 'er back.
Come on.
Back, you old bastard.
Come on. Come on.
Hold it!
Now!
Jump him!
- Hey, kids, get that damn chicken!
- Geez!
Get the chicken!
Get it! Grab him!
I'll get it.
Damn!
Get out.
Huh.
Son of a bitch.
- Hey, look. It's the 19.
- Hi, engineer! Hi!
Who are you callin' a fool?
You call me a fool,
I'll push your face in for ya.
Oh, I get a hold of that Shack,
I'm gonna bust his ass bad!
You ain't gonna light up here?
- Well, why not?
- Well, you'll burn us down!
Don't make no difference, kid.
We're gone, no doubt about it.
Ah, it's nothin'
but a old pig car.
Uh, pigs eat corn.
This here's hay.
Well, it's nothin'
but a old steer car.
Ah, so long, kid.
You croak first,
I'll pray over ya.
Ah, don't pull that crap.
Let me tell you somethin'.
What do you mean, "So long"?
- Well, they'll be loadin'
steers in here in a couple of hours.
- Well, what of it?
Steers got horns, kid.
You don't have any.
Ah, they wouldn't do that to us.
- What do you mean, "us"?
- I'll call a cop.
Ninety days on the rocks
ain't horns.
It ain't the rocks, kid-
not in this part of the country.
And it's not 90 days either.
You're paroled to the bottom of a pit...
while the sheriff pockets the two dollars
that he's paid every day for your keep.
And that's no ghost story. This country's
in the midst of an economic depression.
Two dollars a day
is a lot of money.
Even the law
is sweatin' hard times.
Country's gone to hell.
Ah, they couldn't
get away with it.
Not with old Cigaret,
they couldn't.
Old Cigaret?
- You remember Hee-haw Mike, all right.
- Oh, the old-time yegg.
Well, uh, I ain't tryin' to scare ya...
but you ain't seen
Mike around, I guess.
- I heard he got his
neck broke down in Texas.
- Ya heard right.
You the guy that chilled Mike?
Now ya know me.
How was Texas?
Still there. So's he.
Hee-haw Mike got it in Frisco.
Shot full of holes by nobody knows.
Well, how we gonna get outta here?
Well, don't worry, kid.
I won't leave you to face it alone.
We'll die game, you understand?
Come on. Come on. Hey, hey. Damn.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You Rhode Island Red
son of a bitch.
Them horns won't take us alive, kid.
You loony! Geez, you'll get us-
Hey, Captain.
Goddamn!
- Oh, he's gonna be a
mean son of a bitch now.
- What was he before?
Get outta here, you.
Jesus Christ.
Close it! And lock it!
Goddamn bo son of a bitch.
- Mr. Logan, number 19's on fire!
- Holy mackerel!
Don't you understand?
The 19 is on fire!
The 19's on fire!
Son of a bitch!
You ain't cuttin' out on me!
Come on. Get some water up there.
Bring some water!
Come on!
- On your feet, bo!
- Oh, hey! Aw, come on, you guys.
- Oh, wait a minute. Hey, wait! Wait!
- Move!
- Oh, wait a minute.
Aw, come on, you guys.
- That oughta keep you!
Yardlet! Yardlet!
Get them fire extinguishers!
Wait! Wait!
Get some water buckets.
Water buckets!
Wait! Wait!
Sand pails! Sand pails!
- I got a train on fire!
- George, get that fire
extinguisher! Come on!
Get it next to that oil tank,
and the whole yard'll go up!
Holy smokes!
What the hell are ya
playin' around for?
Damn!
All right. Brake it!
Slow her down!
Get ready to kick it.
Get some hand pumps.
Hand pumps!
Come on! Come on! Brake it!
- Goddamn y-
- Okay. Stop her.
Come on, Bill. Get out!
Everybody!
- Okay. Kick it.
- Get all the buckets you can.
- Hurry!
- Kick it!
Okay. Hold it.
Come on!
That's straw in that car.
Get that fire out!
Who forgot to grease
those journal boxes?
Next time I pick up an empty,
I'm not gonna have it burned...
'cause some damned yardlet
forgot to grease the journal box!
Now you clean all those housings.
Oil the bearings, wedges, everything!
You don't ever hand me
another fire.
- Th-That's not what happened.
- I don't care!
You never let it happen again.
Never! Say it!
lt'll never happen again.
Now you get that engine
down to the tower...
and you fill it with water,
you understand?
Bastard.
I'll fix him, so help me, God!
- Get your goddamn hands off me.
- Wait a minute. Cool off.
We're tryin' to tell you somethin'.
What to you want for Christmas, Leach?
I'll tell you what:
The one thing that's never been done
to the Shack-Think, Leach.
A tramp haulin'that son of a bitch
offhis high almighty-
- A miserable bastard
hobo ridin' his train.
- Ah, it'll never happen.
Maybe it has.
Look. Any you fellas Baptists?
Well, my old man's a Baptist.
I'm tryin' to get home
to see him.
He's dyin'.
- You're goin' for a year on the rocks.
- Up yours.
You gonna let that loudmouth
talk like that to you?
- Yeah. He's right.
Look here, you little squirt.
- Cut it.
- How'd you make that train?
- Easy. It's like any other.
- Nobody makes that one.
- It's a local. It's nothin'.
- Nineteen ain't just a local.
- Haven't you heard of the Shack?
- The 19 belongs to him.
- So?
So you ain't gonna live
through the night.
It was easy. Train come off a curve.
I found a blind.
Well, I just laid down there.
I see the train man, his coattails flyin'.
Of course, I was curious, so I jump on
to give the big man a stare in the face.
And you can figure,
we didn't gab much.
He's wavin' his hammer and swearin'
like a big-ass Baptist...
so I just ditched him,
settled down in the empty.
Had him beat all to hell too.
Well, this sorry lookin' bo...
come draggin'his ass through the
transom, got us both locked in.
So I had to burn my way out.
He's cinders now. That's for sure.
Leach, like I told ya.
You're gonna get a Christmas present
in October.
Damn.
Well, we're bettin' on a sure thing.
Let's put it to 'im.
What time does
Shack's train pull out?
- 7:00 in the morning.
- I wouldn't miss this.
I've been waitin' for years.
You ain't alone.
Hey, don't forget Cracker.
He oughta be good
for an easy 20.
- You're tellin' me.
- Yes, sir.
It's like money in the bank.
I don't know.
Somethin' ain't right.
Stop worryin'.
You said it yourself.
We're bettin'on a sure thing.
Yeah-like bettin'on
yesterday's horse race.
You keep your mouth shut...
till we've had our fun
and we collected our money.
And you get your ass down to that
junction. You tell your bo friends...
that we got a new king of the road.
My friends, the most effective
means of preventing such evils...
in this work relief program...
will be the eternal vigilance
of the American people themselves.
I call upon my fellow
citizens everywhere...
to cooperate with me
in making this the most efficient...
and the cleanest example
of public enterprise...
the world has ever seen.
- Smile?
- It is time to provide
smashing answer...
for those cynical men
who say that a democracy...
cannot be honest,
cannot be efficient.
If you will help,
this can be done.
I therefore hope that you will watch
the work in every corner of the nation.
Feel free to criticize.
- Tell me of instances
where work can be done better...
or where improper practices prevail.
Neither you nor I want criticism...
conceived in a purely fault-finding
or partisan spirit.
But I am jealous of the right
of every citizen...
- to call to the attention
of his or her government...
examples of how the public money
can be more effectively spent...
for the benefit
of the American people.
Never since m-
Smile.
A-1!
I heard ya comin'.
Y-You beat the Shack.
- Rode in on 19, eh?
- Well, that's not exactly it.
Mmm. Say, it figured.
You had to try him sometime.
Twenty miles in an empty stockcar
ain't exactly tryin' him.
- That's just coppin' a feel.
- Ah, you're still A-1.
- Ah.
- Wha-
Ohh!
Ho-ho-ho-ho.
It's only a week old.
Ah, ha-ha.
Ah, it's a sweet-thinkin',
fast-truckin'man ya are.
Shack hurt ya?
- Never laugh at the devil.
- I ain't laughin'.
Fine.
Well, now-
now you beat the Shack...
climbed the sky, slept with the stars,
why the hell don't ya settle, huh?
Like me. Look.
I talked with F.D. R...
I fought with Pershing,
slept with Harlow-
tamed tigers, drunk poison...
seen the elephant
and gone over the falls.
I've been on the road
and with it...
and haven't moved my ass more than
a foot from here in the last year.
- That ain't a question.
- Got an answer.
Oh, I, uh, lost my bindle
to a couple of road kids.
Well, shall we go among 'em?
Let's go among them.
Quiet, all right! That's right.
Listen all of you guys.
Come this way!
Gather ye round.
I got the news.
I got the message!
Come on! Open up, you stew bums
and alkie stiffs. Get in here.
Open up, ya shovel bums,
fakirs, mushers and gray cats.
Ya think you're the road, do ya? Ha-ha.
Well, he's the road.
He's the Emperor of the North Pole.
He came in on a 19!
Come on. Come on.
I saw the Shack
throw Casey Shine under the wheels.
I once saw a shovel bum
he got close to.
Why he used his hammer
or somethin'!
Some say he's finished off 11 boes.
Sixteen.
How close were ya to him?
Close enough to ride.
I got one eye and one question:
Did he use his hammer?
Hmm, the hammer's mostly for show.
Scares some.
It's the hands you gotta watch out for.
And the brain.
No tramp ever rides
with the Shack.
It ain't never been done. Never.
- Well, you're lookin' at the man.
- See what we tell ya?
We play it right, we can
get a month's pay outta Cracker.
- Well, you better keep this. You're
better lookin' than me. - Hey, A-#1.
- Come on over and have some of my mulligan.
- Oh?
- I've been brewin' it for three days.
You never tasted the like.
- Hey, that's a good idea.
- Boiled garbage is all it is.
- You'd do better on
a plate ofhot cow chips.
- What do you think it is, your birthday?
- Take it easy, Gink.
- He beat the Shack.
He rode the empty in on the 19.
- Aw, the hell he did.
- Some punk kid beat the Shack.
They got him down at the yard.
- Kid?
- He screwed it up.
- What kid?
No one 'cept A-#1
could take the Shack.
What about it, A-1?
- Careful. He carries a knife.
- You ain't tellin'him nothin'he don't know.
- Son of a bitch is gonna do it.
- He's gonna do it.
Good luck, A-1! Good luck!
- Give 'em somethin' to remember.
- Hey, bo.
Where to?
A-1 to Portland on the 19.
But-
But that's Shack's train.
Mark it.
That's the way, boy-
in great big letters.
Sure sounds pretty fishy to me.
l- I just can't believe that.
You mean, you're tryin' to tell me
that nobody's ever ridden on Shack's train?
- Nobody.
- Aw, come on.
- I just don't believe nobody.
- Nobody?
- Nobody.
- Aw, somebody.
- Who?
- SkysailJack. He made it.
- Huh! Your butt, he made it.
- Sure, he made it.
- Huh! Ask him.
- What?
Go on. Tell him if Skysail Jack
ever rode Shack's rails.
Skysail Jack? In a coffin.
Oh, every train can be beat.
That's all.
No, no. Not Shack's-
not these guys.
See, it no more than you can whup
Jack Dempsey.
Somewhere there is a
bo than can or has done it.
Oh, yeah?
Well, five says there ain't.
Ten says there is.
Fifty dollars. Match it, or eat it.
You're covered!
Yeah. Well, get to work, you guys.
- Cracker'll want an extra man.
- I got my crew. No students.
Was tryin' to see
you don't take on company.
I don't take on company, yardlet-
not even you, if you ain't got a ticket.
Who you lookin' at, mister?
I learned my trade on a tough road,
and that's a fact.
- You ain't no bo.
- The hell I ain't.
Talk up, boy. Tell him!
- You're a tenderfoot.
- Bullshit! He came in on the 19.
Bought himself a free ride on
the special. They saw him get off.
You know what I do to people
who say what you've done?
I did it.
I rode your goddamn train.
There's only one bo
that's got the stuff to try me.
You ain't even on the list.
Any tramp that sets foot
on my train...
I'd hold him out
and shake him to death like a snake!
Yeah. I'm onto you, kid.
You're nothin'
but a lousy little bum.
I rode your train free,
and I wasn't the only one.
Tell me about it!
- Don't matter.
- Oh, it does to me.
Let's you and me take
a walk down by the crick-
and discuss this, just you and me.
A- #1! A-#1!
His name is on the tower. I seen it.
The gink said he'd come in on the 19.
He's goin'back out in the morning.
Northbound to Portland.
A- #1? Who's A-#1?
Never met him... yet.
- Five dollars he makes
it all the way to Portland.
- Five dollars?
What are ya talkin' about, to Portland?
The kid was a fluke.
Now, he was a cinch bet, but no hobo
is gonna ride Shack all the way to Portland.
That- It'd take more than a miracle.
A-1 ain't just any bo for five.
- You're covered.
- LetJack hold it.
- Okay. Here.
- Not me. I want no part of it.
- Who's gonna hold the money?
- Okay, okay! I'll handle the money!
Now look. l- I hate Shack
as much as any of you guys...
but that bo ain't even gonna
make it outta the yards, and here's
another five to prove it.
- Five too? Take it.
- And he's got a chance if there's fog.
You're covered.
Put me down for seven bucks.
Tell the telegraph operator
to let the boys down the line in on it.
Tell 'em in North Plains
what they got comin'.
Tell 'em in Eugene, Albany, Salem.
Tell 'em!
Cottage Grove will cover
all bets up to $600...
- on or against A-#1
riding the Shack to Portland.
- Attention, Cottage Grove.
- North Plains bets $85 on the Shack, $ 78
on A-#1. - This is Albany. $ 177 on A-#1.
Attention: Portland advises
it's a federal crime...
to use the telegraph line
for the purpose of making wagers.
Portland also advises
we are betting $255 on the Shack.
Okay, fellas. I got a week's pay
on the Shack's big nose.
- A whole week's pay?
- Twenty dollars- any or all of it?
- You got a customer. Remember me?
I'll take half.
- You're covered.
- Hey, don't take all of it. Give me two.
- You got it.
I'll take 75 cents Put me down for 75 cents.
- No trust, Harry. Put up or shut up.
- Give me 50 cents.
You're on.
Well?
The other side. Go on!
Jesus.
- Try the awls.
- A hatpin.
- It's only got two tumblers.
- What do you know about tumblers?
- Come on.
- Gently, gently, gently. That'll do it.
You know, Cracker and that Shack
really baitin' the trap today.
Shack'd rather kill a man
than give him a free ride.
That's it. Easy, easy.
Goddamn Shack's gonna put this down
in his bad-day book.
- He sure is.
- Easy, Smile. It's like a woman.
Opens wide with an easy touch.
There she goes. Ha-ha!
I'm proud of this bastard.
Magic fingers gets you stuff like that.
Shh!
Right. In the trenches. Out of sight.
Come on. Come on.
- Well?
- All set.
- Wish I was goin' with him.
- Me too.
- Almost makes me wanna go back on the road.
- She's a big ride.
Treat her right, bo.
Turn her upside down,
says, "made in hell."
You've got your work cut out for ya.
There's a fast mail going through
the junction at 7:10.
- That's 11 minutes.
- I'll be there in four.
Three miles?
Not at yard speed you won't.
- I won't be goin' yard speed.
I'm gonna highball.
- Highball?
- The hell you are, Shack.
- I'm not givin' away another free ride.
I can't even see the end
of my train in this fog.
I'm gonna have 20 miles an hour under me
before he has his first chance.
If he wants to try to deck that,
he'll end up sellin' pencils.
This is my yard, and I'll give you the clip
on how you go, or I'll telegraph Division.
Well, now, you telegraph Division.
And what are ya gonna say- that you're
gonna open up this road to tramps? Ha!
There.
Move.
- 6:59.
- 6:59.
Here she comes.
Come on, Shack.
We got our money down on ya.
- All the way, Shack. All the way, Shack.
- That's it.
You're a loser, Shack!
A- #1's gonna ride your back all the way!
Forget it, Shack.
A-1 's gonna ride ya all the way!
- That son of a bitch is gonna highball.
- What did you expect?
- Yeah, he's gonna highball in the
yard! - Naturally. - But in the yard?
That's great! Faster!
Goddamn you! Faster!
Shack! Shack, she's old.
She oughta be in the shop!
Shack, her cylinder packing's
wearin' through!
Shack! Listen, Shack!
Keep it open. Give her steam-all she'll take.
Shack, her side rod's poundin'!
Can't you hear it?
Shack, can't you hear it?
She's bindin'!
- She's gonna bleed!
- I can't hear nothin'!
Now, you keep it open!
You hear me?
You keep it wide open.
She can't take it, Shack.
She can't take it. Shack!
Come on, Shack! A-1 's waitin' for ya.
- Here she comes.
- Get down. Get down.
And there she goes!
Close the throttle!
Shut that throttle!
Lord have mercy!
Holy jumpin'Jesus!
Christ.
Guess who, Shack.
It's the big, bad bo, Shack...
and he's gonna bite your big, bad ass!
- That switch is turned.
- Hey, Shack, we spoil your day?
Where the hell is Shack?
Damned if I know.
He's outta sight up-track.
7:02. Eight minutes! Shit.
Shack, you ain't so high
and mighty now, are you?
- Doesn't Shack know
we're runnin'out of time?
- Boxed in, Hogger-
out of track front and back.
Ain't never heard
of such a thing.
Highballin' outta the yards,
bustin' through switches. Geez.
Hey, Shack,
you left your caboose hangin' out!
I hope you've got
your pension paid up, Shack.
Holy shit.
Hey, cover man, now you know
what ass-whuppin'is all about.
S-Six m-minutes.
Don't worry, Shack. It ain't so bad.
We'll keep a place for you in thejungle-
six... feet... down!
Hey, back her off!
She ain't clear.
You get a chance,
you use this, understand?
Hurry up. Let's get this
goddamn thing outta here.
Hey, Shack!
You have as much chance...
as a one-legged man
at an ass-kicking contest.
A-#1 ain't any old bo, Shack.
Hey, Shack!
You got a big surprise comin' to you.
We'll save you a place
on the bread line, Shack.
Cap', we only got four minutes.
- Take her out- up-track.
- What if we don't make it?
We got no choice.
Two miles back, one mile up. Move it!
- Bye! So long See ya!
- Shack!
Shack! Shack! Shack!
Shack!
Right side! Right side!
Hey! Hey!
Stop the train!
Stop the train!
Hogger, back it up!
Back her up!
Hey, bo! Hey, bo!
Hey, are you listenin'?
In three damn minutes,
you're gonna hear a whistle...
which'll mean a fast mail
comin' down through the junction!
And it'll mean a head-on
with 10 people aboard!
Sounds like a ghost story to me.
See you around, Shack.
Come on. Come on.
Get this goddamn train movin'.
All right. Move it!
Come on! Come-
- She's stalling! She's stalling!
- Sand! Sand! Give her sand!
Easy on the throttle, Shack!
Easy on the throttle!
Move! Sand! More sand!
Goddamn you!
Move, you son of a bitch!
Move! Sand! Sand!
Faster!
Faster!
Shovel, you black son of a bitch!
Shovel! Shovel!
- Thejunction! Thejunction!
- Pour it on!
Pour it on! I want speed!
More speed!
Get more coal down!
Jesus!
All right. Move it out!
I said move it! Now!
Sheesh.
- Well?
- I didn't see nothin'.
You didn't see nothin'?
Well, check it again!
Move it! Goddamn!
Goddamn, you one dumb son of a bitch.
You wanna pick one, you got it!
This ain't no game!
Hell, it ain't.
You look like a sore loser to me.
Yeah.
Get grease on that.
Grease from the journal box!
Son of a bitch.
Give me that.
All right. Bring her back.
What about it?
Nothin'so far.
Anything in the empty?
He ain't in here neither.
Are ya lookin'careful?
Sure, I am.
I'm lookin'careful.
Come on back.
I don't know why the captain
don't stop messin'around.
He know them boes
ain't no account.
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Hold it.
Okay, bring her back.
Well?
- Nothin'.
- You're damn right, nothin'!
You never seen nothin'!
- I did!
- A hat!
- A goddamn hat!
- Comin' off a car goin' fast.
- A rag! Some axle packin'!
- No! Shit!
Goddamn newspaper!
That's what you saw!
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
I don't know.
Somethin' or nothin'?
Which did you see?
Well?
- Nothin'.
- Bullshit, nothin'!
You saw a goddamn hat!
Shithead!
Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow!
Oh! Oh, Gero-
Like I was tellin' you,
there was a day a dump had quality.
But by God, the trash in this country
has gone to hell.
You son of a bitch!
Well, I thought we was buddies.
Leave me to get messed up.
On your feet!
- Regular out-and-out?
- Yeah, you'll remember it.
Well, then, I guess the game is up, hmm?
To the finish.
I'll do my share.
Drive away.
You ever ride the Cannonball
on the Wabash?
Come up on the C&A from K.C.
when there ain't no steps to grab?
Ah, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Listen.
No, wait a minute. Listen.
Let's give 'em somethin'
to talk about.
Take the 19 and break Shack's neck.
Hell, who knows this business
better than we do?
Look. Why don't you give it up, kid?
Walk on to the next town
and buy a ticket out.
Hit the French country-
Montreal.
Why, you rub your stomach up there...
and those nuns'll give you a slice
of sow belly and a crust of bread.
Even let you sleep
with the mules.
I've bummed this country five year.
I got my moniker written on towers
from Seattle to Miami.
I been where it's mean,
and I want it that way.
You ain't stoppin'
at this hotel, kid.
My hotel! The stars at night-
I put 'em there.
And I know the presidents- all of'em-
and I go where I damn well please.
Even the chairman of the New York Central
can't do it better.
My road, kid! And I don't give lessons,
and I don't take partners.
Your ass don't ride this train.
Hey! Ohh! Ow!
Ow!
Bastard.
All right.
Get out of my way, you miserable-
Yeah, that's fine.
Not the gunwales!
Try the roof!
Didn't you hear me, kid?
Yeah, I heard ya.
Don't mean a goddamn thing to me.
Not to old Cigaret, it doesn't.
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ow! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
- Give me your hand.
- No.
Come on. Get your hand on the rod here.
Hold on.
Give me your other hand.
Come on. Swing it across.
Come on. Let's go.
Now swing your ass over the rod.
On the rod. Come on.
Now off it. Get up.
Old Hee-haw Mike never taught you
to ride down trains, did he?
Come on.
Get your other arm up.
All right. Keep on goin',
right up to the roof.
Go on, kid.
Don't stand there.
Keep goin'. Go on.
Ow!
Now, look. If you think I'm-
What the hell are you doin'?
Teachin' you.
Why?
I'm still workin' on that.
Huh?
What the hell's goin'on here?
What are we stopping for?
Everything's okay, folks.
Just stay on the train.
We won't be here long.
All right.
Everybody back in your seats.
Mr. Collard, we've got
a schedule to keep.
They greased the rails,
the goddamn tramps!
I don't give a damn if they're
democrats! Get this moving!
Give her sand.
Get back to your seats there.
We'll be movin'right along.
More sand!
Give her more!
Goddamn tramps!
Look, do exactly what I do.
Nothing more.
Don't like it. Just do it.
Over here. Here.
Come on. Grab on.
Oh, shit!
Don't listen to the wheels, kid...
unless you're tied down,
and you wanna sleep.
Then when your blood
starts to get thick...
you edge over
and take a look at 'em.
It'll start to flow again.
Sure is nice to be
eatin' standin' still.
Yeah, you're right. The way things are
these days, it's good to be eatin', period.
Nice sight, huh, kid?
We'll ride that bastard yet.
Oughta keep you alive
till we get to Salem.
Here she comes.
Stay back from the
train till it stops.
Hurry up, dear.
It only stops for a few minutes.
I'm coming.
Just wanna get a newspaper.
All aboard! All aboard!
Hurry up, dear.
Well?
What's the matter?
Ain't you ever seen nobody shave before?
- All aboard!
- What do you know?
- All aboard!
- Good-bye!
Have a good trip.
Good-bye.
Good-bye. Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
I'm trustin' you, kid.
Cover for me.
Hey, you, come back here!
Let go! Let go of me!
Hey! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Hey, hey. Come on.
Hey, look who it is!
Goddamn! It's A-1.
- What's he doin' here?
- What's goin' on?
Shh. Quiet.
Stop! It'll be the
rock pile for you!
Come back here!
Come on!
In the caboose, kid!
In the caboose!
He must be crazy.
He's gotta be crazy.
I guess he ain't here, all right.
You tell him it's 90 days on the rocks
if I get my hands to him! He's sent up!
He's sent up.
- Now, you just give me that!
- Uh-uh. The sale was final.
Well, you can keep the turkey,
but I'm takin' the kid in.
Turkey? What turkey?
Who sees a turkey?
Well, this here's a dog.
I'm only doin' what I'm told to do!
You gentlemen
ought to understand that!
Look what you've done.
- What have I done?
- Now he thinks he's a turkey.
- Better bark for him.
- What?
Bark for him.
What?
I must have wax in my ears.
Hey, okay.
Hey, a drink for this great lover
of dogs. That's all right.
I'm- I'm a man of temperance.
Well, so am I. You could nurse
a baby with this stuff, right?
Okay.
Go on. You only live once.
Must be a sign of the times.
The governor in this state can steal,
and an honest man can't.
And we get a cop
who don't drink.
How'd you come in?
Private compartment
of the Great Northern mail.
They was crazy
to think they could knock him off.
Ain't no shack alive can take A-1.
No, sir.
- Show 'em their best ain't good enough.
- All right, boys.
How about a little doggie for supper?
I'll get a pot.
I'll get a pot.
Get that fire goin'good.
You look like the president
of the railroad, kid.
Why don't you take your hat off?
You come in here
like you was a millionaire.
Well, you're not.
You're a casual.
You ain't even seen
a first-class hobo yet.
Where you been sleepin'?
Straw stacks and barns.
You've slept out.
Why don't you say so?
- You got any money?
- Couple of pennies.
Willing to be searched?
You're a punk, a deadbeat.
No bum worth a damn is gonna
let himself be picked over.
How long you been out?
Thirty days?
Where do you think you're at?
You let some two-bit cop cut you down,
and now you're gonna come in here...
and figure on cuttin' me
and Shack down at the same time?
Damn, boy.
You ain't even ready
for a half-grown girl.
One of those New Orleans women get a
hold of you, you'd cry for your mama.
But it's plain you've already
cried for your mama.
Get your head up!
What have you learned?
Spit it out. How much?
I'm gonna tell you once, never again,
so listen tight.
You've got a chance
to be a good bum.
You can be a meat eater, kid-
I mean people,
not their garbage.
I wanna see you rough as a jungle cat.
Keep on goin' the way you are.
Keep gettin' knocked around...
in the same places
till the knocks don't hurt anymore.
Then you run with the train.
Remember it.
But don't ever grab
unless you're sure you can hold on.
If you ever let go,
she'll throw you under.
Want some new togs
for the kid?
No.
- How good a thief are you?
- Huh?
Are you any good at stealin'?
Are you any good at stealin'?
For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son...
that whosoever believeth in him shall
not perish but have everlasting life.
And so I say unto you,
do not displease God.
Would he say unto you,
"Well done, thou good and
faithful servant,:
thou hast been faithful over a few things,
and I will make thee ruler over many things"?
No, brothers and sisters.
The master said...
"By thy words thou shall bejustified."
- For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son.
And if it's good enough forJesus,
it's good enough for Paul.
It's good enough for you and me,
brothers and sisters.
For here I find the door
of hope and salvation.
- Do you rejoice in God, sister?
- I rejoice.
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters.
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters.
Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!
- Oh, hear my prayer,
Blessed Virgin Mother.
Reveal thy wisdom.
- How beautiful is thy revelation.
- Amen.
- Lord, I have sinned.
- Strive for perfection, sister.
Confess your adulterations.
Confess your wanton waywardness.
I confess my sins, O Lord.
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
You're in God's name...
pure of soul indeed!
Praise the Lord
and give me another sinner.
You're next, brother.
You're next, brother.
And Jesus said, "Come unto me,
all who are weak and heavy laden."
O Lord, is there truth among us?
Sanctify thy truth.
Have you sinned, brother?
I have sinned.
How, then, can the Lord sanction
such neglect?
I will immerse you rather than
have you go to the Presbyterians.
Save me from
the Presbyterians.
O Lord, give the world
to this poor sinner.
- Jesus Christ!
- That's right.
Trust in the Lord, brother.
- I feel his workings within me.
- He is your savior.
Jesus hears you!
Confess, sinner.
Are you resolved to devote your life
to Christ and his work?
The Lord is my tabernacle.
And his ship is filled with gold.
Well, set sail for the pearly gates.
- Hallelujah, brother.
- Hallelujah!
Reverend! Reverend!
Reverend!
Some son of a bitch stole our clothes!
After him! After him! Catch him!
Don't let him get away!
Find the thief!
After him!
All right.
Now you listening?
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I'm listening.
You tighten your belt, turn up your
collar, do everything you're told...
you can be
Emperor of the North Pole.
You don't,
then you are out, O-U-T!
- Emperors know a lot, huh?
- They know plenty, kid.
A-1 knows more.
Let's go.
Come on! Let's go!
It was like that all the way.
He was crazy
thinkin' he could take us.
- Thank you, Cracker.
- Shit.
Goin' up against the Shack
is like goin' up against Dempsey.
He was lucky
the Shack let him live.
Jesus Christ! On the tower!
On the tower!
Takes a lot of guts,
I'll tell ya.
He must be some bo, that A-#1.
He goes all the way to Portland,
he makes history.
Okay, I'm givin'odds on the bo.
Eight-to-five, A-#1 makes it.
You're on. Ten bucks.
6:40.
6:40.
I suppose you wanna highball.
No, I don't wanna highball.
Regular speed.
Ain't we gonna highball?
No, we ain't gonna highball.
Just regular speed.
Oh.
Just look like
you're searchin' the train.
Look like you're searchin' the train.
Do you understand?
Sure. Search the train.
Well, move it!
Aha!
Ah! Hey!
Grab the rope!
Well, grab it!
Cracker!
Cracker!
Goddamn you,
you Cracker, son of a bitch!
You stupid idiot!
When I tell you to do-
Useless bastard.
Wait a minute. I'll get some oil.
Wait a minute, Coaly.
Easy now. Easy.
Easy, Coaly. Easy. Easy.
Damn.
What's the matter?
You look broke up to me.
I can fight like a house afire!
I'm ready!
Ya are broke up bad.
You're quittin'!
Drag your ass back
to theJesus shouters.
Tell 'em they got a stew bum
for the choir.
This bo's headin'out.
He's on his way.
And that ain't just to look around either.
I'm gonna parade.
High mucky-muck of everything.
Tramp royale.
Emperor of the North Pole!
Slashing left and right
with my razor.
Puttin'my fist into more faces
than you can figure.
Till they so damn played out,
they surrender to me...
unconditionally, on the spot.
There'll be some stories
about me 'fore I'm through.
Ain't a jungle I walk into
where they won't know my name.
I'll have kings and queens
and royal flushes...
and I'll be chief of all!
And nothing's gonna be too good
for this big fella.
There's gonna be
some bust-in heads.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm talkin' straight.
You better listen.
I ain't stickin'with you anymore.
You ain't good for bummin'.
You ain't mean enough for it.
You can't handle this Shack.
Get off his road!
Easy. Easy. Easy.
Easy now, Coaly. I know it hurts.
Oh, God, it hurts!
It hurts!
Get your ass over here!
Now you get us the hell outta here!
Now!
Oh! Help! Oh!
You son of a-
You bastard.
Got yourself a game leg, huh, kid?
You should've jumped off. That would
have been the smart thing to do.
You should've jumped, kid!
I gotta hand it to you, kid.
Yes, sir.
You played both sides
against the middle.
Had yourself a high old time
while it lasted.
Yeah, but now it's lasted long enough.
Oh, you can keep runnin', kid,
but you're runnin'out of train.
And there's no place to hide.
My brakey's cracked his neck,
the hide's peelin' off the black...
and the Hogger's
ready for the loony bin.
And all because of you.
That's a pretty fair day's work
for a tenderfoot.
But now I'm gonna show you what happens
to people who ride on my train without a ticket.
Too bad you didn't get me too, kid.
Too bad you didn't let that pin bust you up
instead of me.
'Cause now I'm gonna spread your ass
all over these tracks like manure!
Shack!
Your fight's over here.
Jesus.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Don't belly up on me, bo!
You promised me a fight!
Ghost story, huh?
Smart-ass.
Pick it- Pick it up.
You wanna play?
You wanna play, huh, bo?
Come on.
Smart-ass.
Hey!
Oh, no, you don't, Shack.
Like you said, I promised you a fight.
Now, get your ass up here...
you dirty, miserable,
no-good son of a bitch!
Oh, damn.
Hey, bo!
You ain't seen the last of me!
Yes, sir. Gee whiz.
Me and you,
if we ain't the team.
Well-Well, we can go to prison
and free the cons.
We can capture Mexico.
We can do in Rome as the dagos do.
Knockin' down everything we see,
all stuck on ourselves.
Cigaret and A-1.
Yes, sir.
Kid, you got no class.
Stick to barns, kid!
Run like the devil!
Get a tin can
and take up moochin'!
Tackle back doors for a nickel!
Tell 'em your story!
Make 'em weep!
You could've been a meat eater, kid!
But you didn't listen to me
when I laid it down!
Stay off the tracks!
Forget it!
It's a bum's world for a bum!
You'll never be
Emperor of the North Pole, kid!
You had the juice, kid,
but not the heart!
And they both go together!
You're all gab and no feel!
And nobody can teach you that!
Not even A-1!
So stay off the train!
She'll throw you under for sure!
Remember me for that!
So long, kid!
