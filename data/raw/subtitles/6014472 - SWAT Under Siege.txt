(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Yeah?
Yeah.
On my way.
Seriously?
It's a holiday.
Bad guys don't take a holiday.
Go back to sleep.
(SIGHS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
I was hoping we could talk.
Yeah, I gotta go.
So you're still upset?
I'm not upset. I'm just late.
Call you later?
The Monfell Shipping Center has been
non-operational for the last six months.
Since its closure, it's become a
favorite location for Sao Paulo Locos...
to conduct business.
They've come and gone as they
please with minimal resistance.
That ends today.
Late last night, a shipping container
arrived at Monfell from Bogota.
Due to the amount of chatter...
DEA believes this could be their largest
shipment of contraband to date.
The source couldn't identify
exactly what came in.
So whether it's money, arms, or the
ghost of Pablo Escobar, be ready.
Secure the scene, help find the container.
Once you've done that, you all
can go enjoy your holiday.
HALL: We're just barbecuing.
It's a whole thing.
- How about you?
- GUTIERREZ: I don't really have any plans.
- You should come over.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Carley and Becky
would love to see you.
Not me. I'm sick to death of you.
Sorry to ruin your holiday.
Aw, you ruin every day, El. Why
should today be the exception?
Don't call me "El."
When did this come down?
Got the call from DEA at 2. Why?
HALL: A little short notice.
DWYER: We've had shorter.
Yeah.
Don't get that big brain of yours thinking.
It only gets you in trouble.
- Inspiring as always.
- DWYER: And don't fuck up.
Let's go.
Ward? Hello?
WARD: What's this?
PHOENIX: What we're looking for.
- Yeah, it's pretty.
- BENSON: Hey, Chu.
CHU: Mm.
Why don't you come to the beach later?
I'm having a party.
No, I got plans.
BENSON: It's your loss.
PHIL: Benson.
- Why would she go to your party?
- Aren't you too old for this?
Just entering my prime.
Yo, I'm not doing anything. How
come I didn't get an invite?
Remember what happened last time you came?
- No.
- Ask his wife.
ALL: Oh!
HALL: All right, simmer down.
Simmer down.
A little calm-before-the-storm levity.
There's not gonna be a storm.
- What makes you say that?
- WEIR: They've been getting lazy.
We've been letting them do a few scores...
- and now they feel safe.
- Hmm.
Well, I guess we got all
dolled up for nothing.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
HALL: (OVER RADIO) I don't
give a damn what the DEA says.
We go in heavy, stay frosty.
Watch each other's backs...
stick to the plan, stay tight.
Let's do this.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
CHU: Drop the phone and keep
your hands where I can see them.
That was sloppy, Chu.
All, we have guard one on lockdown.
Surveillance is ours.
HALL: Copy.
WARD: The yard's clear.
We got another guard on
the east-side stairwell.
Hands. Now.
WEIR: Clear.
Knees.
How many others are there?
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
Sofi, anything?
Nothing. This was supposed
to be a shipping yard.
- I don't see any containers.
- HALL: Copy that.
Come on, do you have to do that?
Sorry.
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
You sure this is the right place?
This is the place.
Let's go.
- Jackpot.
- Copy. Where are you?
Outside. Northwest side of the warehouse.
Copy. Ward, stay where you are.
Everyone else, meet at
the shipping container.
Copy that.
Look to your left.
Copy. Straight ahead, guys.
I've got 10 to 12 hostiles coming
in hot from inside the warehouse.
Take cover. Take cover.
GUTIERREZ: Take cover.
Cover me.
- You okay?
- I'm all right.
I got you covered. Go.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
PHIL: Gotta get her out.
(GRUNTS)
Stay down. You're gonna be okay.
Are you hit?
Just got the vest.
(SCREAMS)
- Cover.
- Go, go, go.
(BONE CRACKS THEN MAN SCREAMS)
Now you're both being sloppy.
You owe me a beer.
(GROANS)
- DIEGO: Let go. Let go.
- Little help here.
DIEGO: My arm.
- My arm!
- HOOKS: Yard's secure.
- DIEGO: My arm!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?
It's a fucking suicide vest.
- What are you wearing this for?
- Go fuck yourself.
WARD: Inside's secure.
What the fuck?
PHOENIX: We need an ambulance.
BENSON: I'm on it.
Fuck. Phil.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
No.
I got Phoenix. Let me see if
it went through your vest.
(PHOENIX GRUNTS)
I got you.
"It's not gonna be a storm."
Cover!
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Cut him down.
HALL: I don't know why
some crazy motherfucker...
would put on a suicide vest.
That's not our problem anymore.
All right, fine.
- Let me go. My arm.
- GUTIERREZ: That's Diego.
He won't shut up, and the guy
we cut down's not talking.
What'd Dwyer say?
She's sending a wagon.
What?
- Why?
- She wants us to bring them in.
- I thought this was DEA.
- The DEA guys are dead.
She can't get ahold of brass.
WARD: Fucking Fourth.
Till she does, we hang onto them.
We should keep them. Fuck the DEA.
Fuck them all. These assholes killed Phil.
- They should defer to us.
- We're bringing them in.
GUTIERREZ: What a mess.
LARS: Most people are
under the impression...
that since the Southern states
were in favor of slavery...
that they would, once they insisted
on the Three-Fifths Compromise...
found in Article 1, Section
2 of the Constitution...
that determined that slaves are
only worth three-fifths a person.
It was, in fact, the North that did this.
The South would have loved to
have counted each slave twice...
and the North, rightly so...
didn't believe that the slaves that
didn't have the right to vote...
should count equally to those that did.
That would've given the South more power...
to put their influence on the North.
And what's your point?
I thought we were chatting.
(BUZZING)
Yes?
MAN: (IN ALTERED VOICE) You've come
an awful long way for nothing.
It's not that far. Who is this?
Just listen.
Diego fucked up.
He lost Scorpion.
And you have him?
(OVER SPEAKERPHONE) Not that simple.
But I know where he is and how to get him.
Fifty million.
We both know he's worth 10 times that.
I don't think this is a
game you wanna play.
- You don't know who you're dealing...
- I'll be in touch with instructions.
With.
Two hundred years ago, it was so
much easier to buy a human being.
- Check out his story.
- If it's true?
It's fucking Scorpion.
I don't wanna lose him.
Not now. Not again.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
HALL: York.
We're short-handed. Help
Sofi process our guests.
Got it, commander.
(DIEGO SPEAKING IN SPANISH)
- My arm! It's fucking broken.
- I'll break your other one. Move it.
Move.
(SIGHS)
I thought I made myself clear.
We got jumped, and not by some...
You say that, and all I hear
is you weren't prepared.
What happened? Your team take
it easy because it's a holiday?
What was the DEA onto?
- What do you mean?
- Come on, Ellen. This is so fucked.
- Clearly, they weren't honest with us.
- All we know is what they told us.
They acted on a tip that 500 million
in product was moving through Monfell.
Ah. And what's it turn out to be? Hmm?
A guy in a box.
Protected by heavily armed
Sao Paulo Locos soldiers...
Their tip was wrong. What
do you want me to say'?
That doesn't make them fucking liars.
So, what do we do now?
I have calls in. No one's around.
Until we get answers, we sit tight.
- Fuck that. I'm gonna talk to them.
- No, you're not.
You're gonna leave them be.
- They're the feds' problem.
- Jesus Christ.
Phil is dead. Don't you wanna know why?
Right now all I'm thinking about
is what I'm gonna tell his family.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
MR. MAGOO: (ON TV) Elevator to lobby.
Fine.
Lobby, please.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Watch those sudden stops, boy.
Somebody could get hurt.
It's a big place.
And they've got their Christmas
decorations up already.
LARS: Nicholas.
Mr. C. I wasn't, um...
Make yourselves at home.
Welcome.
MR. MAGOO: Confound it,
somebody better nail that down.
Could take a nasty fall from a loose board.
Oh, I just...
Lord help the whole thing.
Nicholas. Did you do what I asked?
Yes, yes. Yes.
I did. Let me just show you.
So I was able to tap into a security
camera across from the shipping center.
Where did they take him?
S.W.A.T.'s got him back at their place.
It's their renovated facility
in the middle of nowhere.
- Sounds like the paint isn't even dry yet.
- How do you know?
I heard it on my police scanner.
LARS: Well done, Nicholas.
Now...
can you trace the number
that called this phone?
Find out who and where they are'?
- I can try.
- Try hard.
Uh, of course. No problem.
DWYER: Melissa, Phil pulled Phoenix out
of harm's way just before he got shot.
He was a hero.
Yes.
You have my word.
Whoever's responsible
for this is gonna pay.
HALL: (OVER PHONE) I'm sorry.
I can't leave now.
No, I understand. Should I cancel today?
No, don't do that.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Travis?
Yeah?
I'm really sorry.
I love you.
It's our turn to host
the holiday barbecue...
so Carley's at home making the food
for 22 kids and their parents.
- What's up?
- Elson called. Said to come down.
GUTIERREZ: Carley still mad at you?
She's not mad at me.
Sorry, man, I'm on her side.
What...? There's no side.
She's not mad at me.
Besides, you can't be on her side.
You're my partner.
That's a brotherhood.
Yeah, but Carley's like my sister.
- And sisterhood trumps brotherhood...
- That's bullshit.
Look...
you decided before you got married
that you only wanted one kid.
Yeah. That was like 10 years ago.
But out of the blue, you
say you want another kid.
Yeah, I said maybe we could think
about having another kid...
- then it became...
- You wanna know what she heard?
You wanna have another baby that
she'll have to carry for nine months.
She's gonna have to walk away from
work after all she's accomplished.
She's gonna wake up 10 times a night
to feed and change the kid...
because you're always off doing this.
- She heard all that with "maybe"?
- Yes.
ELSON: I don't know.
No, no, no, dude. It just keeps
coming up with an error.
I don't know. It's some
sort of remote-access bug.
Have you ever seen it?
Yeah, I tried that. I tried that.
Oh, are you kidding me?
- I had that in the queue.
- While we're young.
I gotta go.
Please don't touch that.
What do you got?
Our friend Diego is a bad, bad dude.
From Honduras, okay?
Joined the Sao Paulo Locos, known
as the S.P.L., when he was 6.
He's now a lieutenant.
- Okay. What about our mystery man?
- ELSON: Scorpion?
Is that what we're calling him?
Yeah, for now.
Nada on him. He's not
in any active database.
What about other databases?
- Such as?
- FBI? CIA? DOD?
I don't have clearance to tap those.
But you could probably do it
without clearance, right?
Are you asking me or telling?
There's no way a guy protected
by S.P.L.'s best is a ghost.
Just find out who he is.
You got it, Boss.
Hey, put Diego in room one.
- Get him to talk, have Ward listen.
- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go talk to Scorpion.
Dwyer's gonna lose her shit.
Let me worry about Dwyer.
(MUMBLING IN SPANISH)
(DOOR BUZZES)
Hey, Diego. We meet again.
You broke my fucking arm.
I gave you the choice to
have your arm broken or not.
You chose poorly.
Now, explain something to me.
Why would a lieutenant be
put on babysitting duty?
Did they demote you, Diego?
Go fuck yourself, puta.
- Who's the man in the box?
- You wanna know who he is?
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
That's who he is. He's the fucking devil.
Want something to drink?
You need a medic. It's a holiday,
but I could have it arranged.
Am I being charged with a crime?
That depends.
- On?
- Who are you?
Have you asked Diego who I am?
(MUMBLING IN SPANISH)
What's that?
He said that this was going to happen.
- Who said...?
- He said they'd come and he'd escape.
Who would escape? Diego...
You're all fucking dead. You don't know it.
You tell them I did this, okay?
You tell them I did this.
Hey, stop.
Diego, stop! Help!
I need some help in here.
Perhaps you should attend to that.
GUTIERREZ: Stop it!
Oh, God.
What the fuck happened?
WARD: He just impaled himself.
HALL: You're kidding me.
Fuck me.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Who the fuck are you?
You have blood on your hands.
Answer the question.
Did you kill him?
No.
He killed himself.
Cracked his skull wide open.
We do not have much time.
I'm not asking again.
What is important is that you listen.
You may think the events
of today were in error...
but I assure you, my friend, they were not.
You better start answering my questions.
I have information in my head
worth billions of dollars.
What kind of information?
The kind that can set the world on fire.
Jesus Christ, enough with
the fucking riddles.
Fine. Here is the truth.
Very soon, you will be told that officers
from a federal agency are here...
to take me into custody.
They are not what they say they are.
Do not let these men take me.
Do this, and I will help you to
survive what is coming next.
- FBI's here for him now.
- What?
I told you I had calls in.
We're handing him over,
so we can all go home.
- Did they say who he was?
- A known terrorist.
Someone they've been after for a while.
- Where are they?
- Lobby.
I'll take care of it.
I'll bring them to him, pass him off.
Gentlemen, you're here for the prisoner.
Commander Hall. I'm Agent Franklin.
My partner, Agent Cox.
- Sorry for the delay.
- No problem.
We appreciate you hanging on to our guy.
Right this way.
That's funny, I thought all
you FBI guys used Berettas.
These are our personal weapons.
- On the job?
- It's a holiday.
So, what'd this guy do to get
on your database, anyway?
- Terrorist stuff.
- Things we're not at liberty to discuss.
"Terrorist stuff." What's his name?
Come on. His name can't be a
matter of national security.
Well, look, it's clear you guys
aren't FBI, so no fooling.
Who are you?
Just hand the prisoner over.
Not until I get some answers.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GUNSHOT)
You are dead, motherfucker.
- Drop the knife now!
- Now!
CHU: Hands on your head.
Knees.
- You all right, commander?
- Prick.
- Got him?
- Yeah, we got him.
Commander?
Commander.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GUN COCKS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
You trust me now?
(DOOR BUZZES)
Hooks.
Hands on your head.
Let's go.
- You all right, commander?
- Yeah, yeah.
WARD: Keep moving.
(FRANKLIN CACKLING)
Keys, cowboy.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die.
Shut the fuck up.
Everything happened the way he said.
Our mystery man's not even
in the FBI's database.
Wait. How do you know that?
You hacked the FBI database?
Just a bit.
Look, on the way to the shipping center...
I made a crack to Weir about this
being the calm before the storm...
and he said there wasn't gonna be a storm.
I don't think they were
expecting any resistance...
- which is odd, don't you think?
- It doesn't matter.
- There is a protocol we need to follow...
- Oh, fuck the protocol, Ellen!
This isn't the end of it.
We lost enough guys today.
I don't wanna lose more.
You're a Cop, right? At least you
were before you put the jacket on.
What does your gut tell you?
Let's see what he has to say.
HALL: You know this man?
He actually just tried to
kill me to get to you.
I've never seen him before, but I
know more like him will be coming.
- Many more.
- Why won't you tell us your name?
That is for your protection.
- The less you know...
- Well...
the ink on your back's
not Sao Paulo Locos...
nor does it rep any of their rivals, so
you're clearly not a part of that game.
My guess is you're Special Ops.
You've been tortured, from the
looks of it, more than once.
You could have easily escaped our
compound, but you chose not to.
Why?
You need our protection...
because everyone and their
mother's coming after you...
because what you know...
could cause blowback.
It is far more complicated than that.
Fill me in here. What am I missing?
Because I believe you when you
say more like him are coming.
But you're gonna have
to square-up with me...
if you want us to do more
than just turn you over.
You were correct about Special Ops...
but that was only in the beginning.
I quickly realized that
information was true power.
- So you're a spy.
- And I have the goods on everyone.
(COMPUTER WHIRRING)
Hm.
SIMONE: What is it?
NICHOLAS: I traced the cell phone.
LARS: Who is it?
I don't have a "who"...
but I have where the call originated from.
Okay. So, what happened? How'd
you end up in our cell?
I...
made a mistake in Bogota.
So Why'd they capture you?
Why not kill you?
To facilitate my sale.
DWYER: Bullshit.
S.P.L. knows their lane. They're not
dumb enough to trade in that game.
No, but others do.
- Who, then?
- Unsure.
But one thing I am sure of...
Someone from your team is involved.
LARS: Nicholas, who are these people?
Show me who we're up against.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Where you going, Travis?
- Commander?
- I'm moving him.
Where?
Not alone. The team should be in on this.
HALL: No.
- Just me.
- What, are you crazy?
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Nothing about today makes sense.
If I tell you where I'm going...
- they could get it out of you.
- They wouldn't be able to.
They're coming for him, Sof...
and they're not gonna stop.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
I won't let another person
I care about die today.
If they know he's here, they could
be watching the compound, and...
I'll have Elson review the area.
Thanks.
(KEYS JINGLING)
I'm moving you.
Moving me will not keep
them from coming for me.
No, but it'll keep them from my team...
and that's my priority.
(SIGHS)
It's how it's gotta be.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Yo, commander, what's going on?
Hey. Just saw Hall taking Scorpion out.
What do you mean, "out"?
(PHONE BUZZING)
It's him.
Hello?
MAN: (IN ALTERED VOICE) Listen to me
carefully. You don't have much time.
How we looking?
Yeah, yeah. Everything looks good.
No unusual activity.
GUTIERREZ: "Remote Access
Error." What is that?
ELSON: That? I don't know.
That has been bugging me all day.
SNIPER: I'm in position.
Did you disable the camera
that shows our sniper?
What I did was record footage
before he got there...
and just have it playing
back on a continuous loop.
A simple "yes" would suffice.
- GUTIERREZ: Is he clear?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Think they're watching?
- They are definitely watching.
Travis, stop!
What are you doing?
You said you didn't want
anyone else to die.
Yeah, and that included you.
I'll radio when I'm safe.
Let's go.
I was personally put in charge of Glen
Damone's protection. Know who that is?
The mafia accountant.
Trial lasted five months, no less
than 20 bounties on his head.
He never got one scratch under my watch.
Wait. Wasn't he assassinated
shortly after the trial?
That was on Witness Protection, not me.
Watch your head.
When they clear the compound,
take out the driver.
- If anyone kills Scorpion, they die next.
- SNIPER: Roger that.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
- SNIPER: They're leaving the facility.
- Take him out.
- You'd be wise to take cover.
- What?
Duck!
- Oh, shit.
- They're under attack.
- We gotta go.
- CHU: Let's move!
- Where are you going?
- To help.
- You're not field. Help from here.
- Find out where the backup is.
- WOMAN: Dispatch.
- This is Seattle S.W.A.T.
We're under heavy attack and
need immediate assistance.
Roger that, Seattle S.W.A.T.
Hang tight.
Backup's on its way.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
SCORPION: Commander?
MAN: Go. Go. Go.
SNIPER: I've got the shot.
(GUNSHOT)
Not on my shift, motherfucker.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Fuck!
Do not let him get away.
Commander, nice of you to join us.
HALL: Son of a bitch.
Back to the compound. Move it. Now!
(GUNFIRE)
Holy fuck.
MAN 1: Left, left, left.
- Clear.
- MAN 2: Clear. Go.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
MAN 3: Get the truck out.
- Everyone inside.
- HOOKS: Gutierrez.
- I'm on the move.
- Go, go.
Dwyer, shut us down.
- I'm on it.
- Shut us down now.
What part of "we need him
alive" do they not understand?
(KLAXON BLARING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Are those shields?
Well, you have to admire their resilience.
Nicholas...
can you open them?
It's one thing to hack
their comms and cameras...
but shields are controlled
by the mainframe.
It'd need to be taken out
before I can do anything.
LARS: Find a way past those shields.
Leave the rest to me. In the
meantime, kill the power.
Kill everything.
Ready the next wave, and let's see
how resilient they truly are.
SIMONE: Got that?
HALL: Where's the backup, Elson?
What the fuck happened?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up, hold up.
What are you doing?
I assure you, inspector, what's out there
is far more dangerous to you than me.
They're only dangerous
to us because of you.
You brought this to our door, all
of it, and I can end it right now.
And you think killing
me will stop this war?
Ellen, this isn't who we are.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
- Now what?
- What's going on, Elson?
ELSON: They cut the comm and power, and
judging by the signal on my cell...
- they're jamming the cell tower too.
- Fuck.
Any satellite phones on-site?
ELSON: Yeah, none that are working.
Why are cameras working but
not Internet or phones?
In cases like this, you wanna see.
So we put security on
the internal mainframe.
And they would want to see as well.
They hacked the security cameras.
- They can do that?
- It's not that hard.
For somebody who's good enough, it's not.
HALL: Cut the interior security cameras.
- Don't let them see what we're doing.
- ELSON: Copy that.
SCORPION: Get this through your skulls.
These are professional soldiers. They
will isolate you, intimidate you...
until they find your weakest
link and then exploit it.
(PHONE RINGING)
- I thought you said the phones were out.
- They are.
HALL: Hello?
LARS: Commander Hall?
Yeah.
I'm the man in control of the small
army sitting on your doorstep.
Do you have a moment to chat?
If you want to put me on speaker, go ahead.
I understand.
Everyone should hear.
(OVER SPEAKERPHONE)
I should've done this earlier.
It would've saved us all
a lot of time, sweat...
and blood.
I have your compound surrounded.
Your power, your network...
all of your communications are down.
No one knows that you're in trouble,
and no one's coming to help.
Your officer spoke to
my associate, Simone...
not the dispatch operator.
Hello.
The man you pulled out
of a box belongs to me.
Hand him over...
and I'll go away.
Just like that?
Just like that.
Can't do it.
Scorpion...
I know you're listening.
Tell these people who I am.
His name is Lars Cohagen.
He runs a private military corporation...
- that specializes in dark ops.
- The kind that overthrow small countries?
- Some not so small.
- Hm.
LARS: Now that we're all in the know...
why don't you come on out and spare
the lives of these nice people?
Let them return home and enjoy
what's left of the holiday.
They could still catch the fireworks.
How many times are we going to do this?
This is it.
This is our last dance.
I've heard this before.
Commander Hall, the man you're
protecting is a consummate liar.
His skills of deception
supersede even mine.
In fact, I will guarantee that
he's lying to you right now.
Has he told you there's one in your
organization that's against you?
Or that he has information that
could set the world ablaze?
He's a liar...
and a killer and nothing more.
All your problems go away if you just...
turn him over.
And I already told you...
I'm not doing that.
SIMONE: Commander...
so this stranger's life is more
important to you than your team's?
What about Daniel Chu?
David Jefferson?
Luis and Maria Gutierrez?
Carley and Rebecca?
Is Scorpion's life worth more
to you than their lives?
Are all their lives worth
Scorpion's to you?
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Enough. I'm coming out.
But before I do...
I want your guarantee.
No harm comes to anyone
here, nor their families.
You have my word.
I will be out in 10 minutes.
You'd better be.
ELSON: Commander, try the phone again.
Maybe we have a live line out.
HALL: No.
Shit.
HALL: You're not giving yourself up.
SCORPION: I never said I was.
I only said I was coming out.
- You think you can take his army alone?
- I work best alone.
With the shields down, this
place can withstand a riot.
You don't have to go.
WARD: Well, hold on a second. I'm confused.
- You giving yourself up or not?
- He's not.
- We can't let him.
- HOOKS: Yes, we can.
Did you not see that army out there?
We just lost Phil and Benson.
I don't plan to join them
because of this son of a bitch.
You heard him, commander.
He's threatening our families,
and there's no backup.
This guy's a fucking liar. He
could be playing us. Let him go.
No. We're not giving in
to this Lars asshole.
Not after all that's happened.
It ain't his fault a lunatic's
shooting the building.
Maybe it is. We don't know.
Scorpion could've escaped
or killed us several times.
He didn't. I believe him.
That just might mean that he
needed our help to survive.
That doesn't disprove what Lars said.
Believe Lars when he says
he will stop at nothing...
to find a way inside to get me.
If I do not come out now,
that army outside...
those phony agents...
they are just the tip of the iceberg.
You're right.
We'll put you by the back door.
Only it won't be you.
In theory, it should work. I loaded
everything you need on the laptop.
You should be good to go.
I wanna thank you for your
assistance today, Nicholas.
Oh, my pleasure, Sir.
Did you know that Scorpion
and I used to be partners?
Right. You were saying.
It was great for a while...
and then five years ago in
Berlin, he betrayed me.
After all we'd been through.
You know, and I knew it.
I knew something was wrong,
but I didn't react in time.
Since then, I've taken greater precaution
in my business dealings because...
no matter how much you
think you know someone...
they could stab you in the back.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Um...
Yeah, I think so.
Good.
WARD: All right, let me get this straight.
You wanna raise the door
shields and let the army in?
Not let them in. Lure them
close, then ambush them.
Why won't that work?
Because it's batshit crazy.
HALL: Well, there's no way we're
turning this man over to mercenaries.
Once they're in the
courtyard, they're trapped.
How do you figure that?
The back door is located in the
deepest part of the courtyard.
Here.
Now, about three dozen office
windows look down onto it.
That's where we'll be.
We'll make them think
we're handing you over.
To sell it, Elson will find a way
to open the rear entrance shield.
Once they get eyes on the bait...
they're gonna move in underneath
our hidden positions...
and that's when we hit them.
They'll be sitting ducks.
It's the first time the shields
have ever been activated.
I've never done...
nor am I sure isolated openings
will work as you describe them.
Yeah. Well, you'll figure it out.
They'll be expecting that.
HALL: Yeah. Well, this is our only option.
They got us boxed in.
We can't call out, and
you said it yourself.
It's only a matter of time
till he finds his way in.
At least this way, it's on our own terms.
Look, guys, this isn't an order.
I'm not forcing you into this.
But I, for one, don't wanna sit around
and let someone else determine my fate.
If I'm going out...
it's gonna be on my terms, not theirs.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
If this is what you want,
I will need firepower.
HALL: We have every weapon known to man.
What exactly are you looking for?
- SCORPION: I will know it when I see it.
- We aim to please.
In the meantime, spread out and load up.
Just because I'm browsing don't
mean I'm giving up on you.
What the fuck do you do with that?
You don't want anything to do with that.
That's when you got nothing to live for.
Huh.
YORK: Hey.
Oh. Never mind.
SCORPION: What did you find?
- Excellent.
- WARD: Why?
Regular radios still work.
He may have tapped into those frequencies.
He will not be able to
do so with this model.
Okay. Everyone grab one.
You gotta change.
HALL: How'd you get the
name Scorpion, anyway?
I assume that's not on
your birth certificate.
You are assuming I have
a birth certificate.
All right, you're not
gonna tell me your name.
At least you can tell me
how you know Lars Cohagen.
We were once partners.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
I never said I was a good man,
commander, just good at what I do.
You do not know me, commander.
You should not take this risk.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Even holiday double-time ain't
enough to deal with this shit today.
You know, the job is risk.
It's not about or for you.
Not any longer.
Our guys' blood's been spilled today.
Someone's gonna pay for that.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
SCORPION: There is one thing
you have not addressed.
The person on the inside
who is working against us.
When they attacked the van,
they were waiting for us.
Someone told Lars you were
taking me from the compound.
GUTIERREZ: (OVER RADIO) Two-minute warning.
Copy that. Everyone get in position.
- We go on my call.
- Copy that.
Good luck.
Never really believed in luck.
Well, good luck anyway.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Everyone set? Know what they're doing?
ALL: Yes, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Sof, you remember Suffolk,
a few years back?
Yeah.
That was another supposedly
cakewalk mission...
that turned into a shitshow.
What was it, 40 gangbangers
against eight S.W.A.T.?
I tell people I never know
how we survived that night.
But I do know.
We're S.W.A.T.
We're the baddest motherfuckers on Earth.
Let's get in position.
Take care of each other.
The least he could do is give us the
microchip to barter for our lives.
There's no microchip. It's in his head.
- Hey, make sure we're in position before.
- DWYER: Hey.
It's not my first rodeo.
Don't fuck up.
How we looking?
When we get the go, I hit enter, and
it'll raise the rear-entrance shield.
- But not the rest of the building?
- Right. Just the rear entrance.
In theory.
In theory?
In theory.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
MAN 1: Position. Hold that position.
MAN 2: All right, let's go.
MAN 1: Left, left, left.
SIMONE: No sign of Scorpion.
Commander, is your team ready?
Let's go around the horn.
Hooks, set.
- Jefferson, set.
- York, set.
- Gutierrez, set.
- CHU: Chu, set.
Ward, are you in position?
Ward?
Sorry, I was using the wrong mic.
We're all set.
- Raise the shield.
- Copy.
(KLAXON BLARING)
It worked.
SIMONE: Right on time.
They're opening the shields by
the rear entrance. Move in.
HALL: Here they come. Get ready.
SIMONE: Third-floor window.
What is that?
Morse code.
- Pull everyone back.
- It's a trap.
Everyone move back. Now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's stopping.
Why is he stopping?
Hey.
HALL: What the fuck just happened?
Fall back to the command center.
GUTIERREZ: Copy. Everyone fallback.
Fuck.
- Elson, shut down the rear shields.
- I'm on it.
- Where's everybody?
- Ward, I don't know.
Scorpion's M.l.A.
- Dwyer left a few minutes ago.
- Where?
We saw a light at the third-floor window...
- and she bolted.
- A light? Which window?
Right there.
Stay here. Keep an eye
on everything outside.
- Where are you going?
- Find the big guy.
Scorpion, come in.
Scorpion, do you COPY?
(WHISTLING)
Get up.
I'm gonna let you out of here.
You're gonna tell Lars I'm gonna find
another way to give him Scorpion.
No one else needs to die.
Shit, it was you.
Yeah, I'll tell him. Lead the way.
WARD: The amount is the same upon delivery.
Fifty million. That hasn't changed.
Fifty million's a sweet
fucking payday for a Cop.
Those DEA assholes are
always skimming off the top.
- About time I got some. Hey.
- Of course it is.
This mess is Hall's fault. If
he had handed over Scorpion...
What the hell's the plan
on getting me out of here?
We're gonna out the power to the mainframe.
With shields up, Lars can
take care of the rest.
- Where are the controls?
- Engineering room.
Thanks.
DWYER: Ward?
(NECK SNAPS)
(GROANING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Fuck.
HALL: Ellen.
Oh...
- You all right?
- Yeah.
It was Ward.
I saw him talking to Franklin
before Franklin killed him.
- Where'd he go?
- In there.
- Yeah.
- Ready?
What's that?
- CHU: What just happened?
- Security feed's been cut.
- We're blind outside now too.
- You said the feed was internal.
It is.
- I've lost control of our security system.
- What's that mean?
What I mean is the same crazy fuck that's
been attacking us can open our shields...
and there is nothing
that we can do about it.
(CLATTERING)
Closer.
Clear.
(KLAXON BLARING)
- What the fuck is happening?
- The shields are raising.
YORK: Can you stop it?
ELSON: No.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
FRANKLIN: What are you
gonna fucking do, huh?
Oh, yeah.
DWYER: Travis.
(GUNSHOTS)
SIMONE: Intel from Berlin.
Dead or alive no longer matters.
I will go in there and fucking
kill him myself if I have to.
Go!
Everyone, move in.
Shoot to kill Scorpion on sight.
MAN: Let's go.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, shit.
- Everyone fall back. Let's go.
- Come on.
HALL: Go, go, go.
Elson, come on.
MAN: After those guys.
Let's go.
Clear.
Move, move, move.
Let's go. Let's go.
Man down!
(MUSIC PLAYING)
HOOKS: Jefferson, come on.
Jefferson.
Go.
(JEFFERSON GROANING)
Later, bitches.
(EXPLOSION)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Get over yourself.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Let's go. Go.
Duck.
HALL: Oh.
You meant that kind of firepower.
SCORPION: I have something to show you.
The way out.
I found a maintenance tunnel.
HALL: Yeah, it's been sealed.
SCORPION: Not anymore.
- Nope. Fuck that.
- Hey, it's either that...
or you go back out there to face a
bunch of badass dudes shooting at you.
- All right, give me a boost.
- Okay.
Fuck.
- CHU: Right behind you, Elson.
- Okay.
- Travis.
- I'm going after Dwyer.
No way I'm leaving one of our own behind.
Get them to safety, okay?
You don't know how many of
them are still up there.
- Or if she's even alive.
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Go on.
- I'm not letting you go alone.
He won't be.
I'll call for backup as soon as I can.
- You don't have to do this.
- I know.
You didn't have to come back just for us.
I didn't.
I didn't.
HALL: Looks like everybody cleared out.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
SCORPION: Unlikely.
Lars would never give up.
(GUNSHOTS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTS)
(GUN CLICKS)
At least I got you.
Now let us see if you can finish the job.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(SCORPION YELLING)
(BODY THUDS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hey.
- What happened?
- It's over.
Good guys won. Come on.
HALL: We lost York and Jefferson.
- DWYER: Oh, God, no.
- Yeah.
- DWYER: What about Scorpion?
- Yeah, he's still alive...
somehow.
- Still no signal?
- HALL: Mm.
Gutierrez said she'd call
it in when they got out.
Cell towers must still be jammed...
but it shouldn't be too long now...
which means you need to disappear.
I don't know if I have
it in me to run anymore.
I am constantly running.
That and all the people
trying to kill me...
it's exhausting.
You got all that money in your head.
Why not just retire?
That is blood money.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
As a matter of fact...
Dude, what the fuck?
SCORPION: Take it.
What the hell is it?
SCORPION: It's what all the fuss is about.
A microchip.
What's in your head. That's clever.
And now it's better in your hands.
DWYER: Late last night, a shipping
container arrived at Monfell from Bogota.
Yeah, what'd he turn out to be?
A guy in a box.
The least he could do is give us the
microchip to barter for our lives.
HALL: There's no microchip.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
- Ellen, what are you doing?
- It's nothing personal, Travis.
You should have just handed
Scorpion over, Travis.
No one was supposed to get hurt.
You should've just let it go.
Don't.
Don't.
It's over.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
MAN: What did I say?
- Good?
- Yeah.
GUTIERREZ: FBI was onto her.
And she knew.
I never liked her.
What is that?
A souvenir.
AGENT: Excuse me, commander.
Can I ask you to come
and identify the body?
Is this the man known as Scorpion?
(MUSIC PLAYING)
- That's...
- That's him.
AGENT: Okay. Take him away, guys.
GUTIERREZ: Is there something
you wanna tell me'?
HALL: Yeah, but for your
protection, I'd better not.
The less you know...
(MUSIC PLAYING)
HALL: Hey, hon.
- How's the party going?
- CARLEY: Travis, oh, my God.
- I've been worried sick. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. I'm on my way.
I'll tell you about it when I
get up there, okay? I love you.
CARLEY: Purple.
BECKY: P-U-R-P-L-E.
- Three.
- One, two, three.
- Four.
- Four.
(CARLEY LAUGHING)
HALL: Wow.
Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- You look like you could use a beer.
Or 20.
- Hey.
- Hey, what's this?
Yeah.
This is enough.
For me.
Just you...
and her.
I don't need anything more.
But I'm pregnant.
(LAUGHS)
- Are you kidding me?
- Surprise.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
- Is that what you were trying to tell me?
- Yeah.
Did you know about this?
Yeah, I could tell.
The two of you...
(FIREWORKS POPPING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PHONE RINGING)
HALL: Hall here.
DISPATCHER: We got a shitshow brewing
at the capitol building in Olympia.
We need you and your team on-scene ASAP.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
