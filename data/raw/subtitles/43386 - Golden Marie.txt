They called it Rose Mill
When I was a child still
lts door was never closed
The miller's wife was named Rose
She would sing me to sleep
Under the sails of Rose Mill
Easy! We're coming ashore.
Watch it, I said!
They're fighting again.
Shut up! Don't make matters worse.
Paul, take the oar!
- Leave the oar.
- Why? It's fun.
- I let you row.
- Did I row badly?
You rowed real nice, Marie.
Leave the oar, I said.
Poor fool.
- I bet...
- Sure, with a guy like that.
Right, honey?
- What?
- Nothing.
Are you coming?
- What about the men?
- They're tying up the boats.
Let's race.
First one there wins!
I win!
I win every time.
- With a head start!
Charming! We can't go anywhere
without meeting tarts.
They always get their way.
- Watch what you say.
Now it's their "gentlemen."
How about some music, boss?
Coming right up.
It's all yours. It'll hold.
Gentlemen...
Hurry up.
The customers are waiting.
Strike up the band!
Alberte!
Will you have a drink?
Sure. Working Sundays makes me thirsty.
You did me a favor.
What do I owe you?
- Later.
- So, gentlemen, how was it?
- Just fine, old man.
- Where's the music?
- What jokers!
- You can't choose your clientele.
Ain't it the truth?
- If it isn't Jo!
- How are you, Raymond?
Let me have a look at you.
You've hardly changed,
except for the handlebars.
What will you have?
Serve us in the house.
Come with me.
Manda, join me inside.
- What'd he call you?
- Manda.
My name's Manda now.
What's in a name?
It's great to see you again.
Same here.
Shall we dance?
- I'm not dancing.
- Why not? You sick?
No, I'm just not dancing.
Go on, Marie, dance!
Attagirl, Marie!
I want you to meet my buddies.
Some other time. My boss is here.
You'll see him later.
You got time, don't you?
Come on, don't be stupid.
They won't bite.
This is my pal, Georges.
Jo to the ladies.
We did five years
in the pen together.
Quite a stretch.
Let me introduce you.
Ponsard the Headache.
Paul, who's never thirsty...
if you get my drift.
Ignore him.
Over here we have...
"Pretty Boy" Roland.
Guillaume the Ferret.
"Boots" Fredo.
Little Billy.
That's me.
And our ladies.
Let's sit down.
How long has it been?
I last saw you...
6, 7 years ago?
Thereabouts.
- What's your friend do?
- I'm a carpenter.
The gentleman works!
Drink up, you must be thirsty.
A carpenter.
See the company I keep?
True, I was a baker once.
But not for long.
Can carpenters dance?
Go ahead.
The best dancer in Belleville!
Do you mind?
Stay put, Roland.
Your woman's a nice girl.
She's just being sociable.
Get a load of him!
Don't he dance nice?
Very nice, even.
- Sit by the lady.
- Thanks, I have a seat.
Not very courteous!
Right, Marie? What d'you say?
If you insist.
Got a problem, pal?
What's your name again?
Roland, pal.
Why do you want to know?
Poor Roland.
Ladies, gentlemen...
Excuse me,
they're waiting for me.
You can't go like that, pal.
It's unfair to your partner.
- That's enough!
You see? She's offended.
You haven't lost your touch.
- So long.
- I'll come with you.
Where'd he go?
Relax. You scared him away.
Got all your stuff?
I wanted to say goodbye.
I got your address...
When do I see you?
- When you like.
Bye, Jo.
So long.
Care to dance, miss?
Watch out.
Got a match?
That's just for starters.
- Hello, Adele.
- What d'ya want?
I want to ask you something.
Have you seen Roland's Marie?
- Haven't seen her?
- She didn't sleep here?
Say!
Hello, Raymond.
Toil, toil, carpent, carpent!
Exactly.
I wanted to see your shop.
You did right.
You slog away here all day?
- Yep.
- Well I'll be!
That where you sleep?
No room of your own?
No. What for?
Excuse me.
I was just passing by...
I won't keep you from working.
I'll come by some night.
We'll go grab a bite. My treat.
Whenever you like.
So long, Jo!
So long.
Goodbye, all.
Sorry to bother you.
- See the broad?
- Yeah. Who's she?
The boss's daughter.
She looks like him.
He say anything about Marie?
So?
In any case, she's not here.
Here we go.
What?
I'm in for it.
Who is it?
Billy and Ponsard.
There's gonna be a fuss.
Are you crazy?
Can't I sleep over
at a girlfriend's?
What is it? I'm in bed.
Open up!
Some manners!
Got a problem with that?
Looks like it.
What do you want?
C'mon, Marie.
Leca wants to see you.
Monsieur Leca!
Imagine that!
Don't keep us waiting.
Beat it!
Can you believe those guys?
Felix Leca
Wine & Spirits
Well?
Nothing.
Cheese? White wine?
There are glasses in the sideboard.
- Thanks. Not thirsty, are you?
- Sure I am.
Poor Paul.
Here she is. Wait in the back
and shut the door.
If you don't mind.
- I'm counting on you, Felix.
- Don't worry.
Shut the door!
Here's the goods.
Hello, gorgeous.
We found her at Julie's.
They're real clever.
And courteous. Real gentlemen.
- Shut up.
- You see?
Thanks, boys.
Wait in the back.
Got a knife?
No bread?
Say, you part your hair
on the other side now.
Let me see.
Not bad.
So...
you fell out with your man?
Yeah, that bother you?
Why?
I don't want any fuss.
I won't tolerate it in my gang.
It's bad for business.
So? What do we tell Roland?
Tell him to drop dead.
Say that again?
Well, say it again.
Will you leave us alone?
I heard the bitch.
You're hard on the staff.
Why do you stay with that jerk?
You find him handsome?
He's not bad.
Does it matter any?
What do you say
I buy you off Roland?
Well, I'll be...
Give me your answer tonight.
Tonight?
Think it over.
Meet me at "The Angel Gabriel."
We'll all be there.
Think it over.
Well?
Later. Call the others in.
Come on in.
Know who he took me for?
The night watchman.
I kept my mouth shut. It was hilarious.
So, boss.
Sit down.
I'd rather stand.
My legs fell asleep.
You're wearing a cap again.
I won't tolerate it.
Wear it Sundays, but not here.
It looks bad to the neighbors.
And what about you?
I got no choice.
Hats look bad on me.
Look.
Why so happy?
You're not in on this one.
I love watching a split.
What a dope!
Your cashier smoked a pipe.
Not any more.
You should've been more careful.
Where does it get us?
- Some things can't be helped.
- Sure.
Here's your share.
Do you mind?
And here's mine.
Count it.
These we don't touch.
They're new bills,
with consecutive numbers.
So it's lost to us?
Relax.
We'll get it laundered in Belgium.
Did you count it all?
There's one wad
with 7 bills instead of 10.
You sure?
See for yourself.
You're right.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
You can go.
That'll be all for today.
You heard me.
Fredo!
He's calling you.
Close the door and come here.
Come here.
You carried the case, didn't you?
Not the whole time.
The 300 francs.
300 francs?
Do you mind?
Go buy me some cigars.
Excuse me?
Ma'am?
Would you do me a favor?
Sure. What do you need?
Get down first.
See that shop there?
A job for you.
Who did that?
Me. I sat on it.
That was smart.
Mr. Manda, please.
That's me. Why?
Someone wants to see you.
Excuse me.
Who wants to see me?
The lady over there.
I wanted to see you,
so I came by cab.
Georges.
Supper's not over.
Who's that?
I should ask you that.
Did he say he was engaged?
I couldn't have guessed.
So long.
Cheers, buster!
You whore!
- What?
- You'd better go.
Sorry, I got it yesterday.
So now we're even.
THE ANGEL GABRIEL
It's here.
But this is a dive!
We'll get ourselves murdered.
Maybe even raped.
That might be fun.
- You'd save us, I hope.
- Of course.
'Evening, ladies and gents.
Let's find you a nice table.
Sit here. It's nice and cozy.
It's too close to the band.
If you'd rather sit over here...
We'll be just fine here.
Anatole!
Coming!
Hey, guys, the swells!
Real swell, too.
- What'll it be?
- What are they drinking?
It's mulled wine.
Mulled wine, it is. All right?
Lucie, you'll be better here.
They're really funny.
I'm just delighted.
This is such fun.
Check out the girl in white.
I'd put it to the bitch!
You might turn her off.
Just watch.
What if we dance?
Never.
You'd all look ridiculous.
Don't be insulting, my dear.
Madam?
- Me?
- A little waltz?
Say yes, or there'll be a fuss.
But I couldn't.
Why don't you dance?
He's asked you politely.
Amazed, inspector?
I am. What are those people
doing here?
I'm here, aren't I?
That's different.
You're here on business.
True. By the way... Boss!
What can I do for you?
You haven't given me your order.
Fleurie or Bourgueil wine?
The Bourgueil's cheaper.
90 francs a cask.
Delivered to your door.
It's good.
Not bad.
I'll give you a discount.
260 for three casks,
instead of 270.
Isn't that a bargain?
If you say so.
Leaving so soon?
Duty calls. It's already late.
My boss is waiting.
- The captain? At this hour?
- My wife!
I almost forgot.
She told me to chew you out.
Not at all. She was happy?
She ought to be.
And port wine is her favorite.
Good night.
I'll let you talk shop.
- You're in his good books.
- Aren't I?
A bad deal, madam.
He's a sleeper.
Over here, beautiful.
You'll have to excuse us.
We girls have to talk.
It might look nice.
Sure. And I'd add a ruche
around the collar.
A black ruche.
Okay, but what's your answer?
- Leave me alone.
- But it's for you...
Get off my back.
Well?
Well what?
Can I talk to Roland?
If you want.
Ladies.
Sir.
I've come to get you, Marie.
That's nice. Isn't it, Julie?
I think there's someone
who wants to say hello.
Can I help you?
No one asked for you.
For you, either.
Go sit down. Drop it.
C'mon, Jo.
So, what are you playing at?
You see, he came for me.
Well, well.
So, Roland?
Step outside, pal.
We'll discuss this.
If you like.
Jo, don't be a fool.
Well?
After you.
No, you first.
Who's that?
Ask Marie.
A friend of his.
I danced with him at Joinville.
Didn't they tell you?
So he's the guy!
You'd better go watch.
Sometimes...
you never know.
Good idea.
Here we are. Now what?
Jo, honestly, drop it.
So, you bum!
Just a minute,
okay?
My name's Leca. Ring a bell?
I've heard of you.
Good for you.
What's your name?
Manda, Georges.
Never heard of him.
Why would you? He's a carpenter.
That's enough, Jo.
- You can see it isn't.
Then let's get started.
Just what do you want?
Marie.
You selling?
It depends. Maybe the man's rich.
A carpenter?
Even if I had money...
I get it.
You'd rather fight to save money.
Maybe.
Let's start.
Search him, Guillaume.
Get inside.
Raymond and Guillaume, stay.
You too, Jockey.
Go sit inside with them.
You came out like chumps.
People will notice.
And shut the door.
- That what you're looking for?
- Got any others?
What would I do with them?
Doesn't he get searched, too?
Don't bother.
Do you mind?
Got a third one, maybe?
- I wouldn't use it.
- Really!
Hold my watch while you're at it.
With pleasure.
You'll fight with this.
You, stand there.
And you, over there.
Back up.
Back up, I said.
Farther.
Step over to this side.
Ready?
Well?
He's a goner.
Well, well...
For a carpenter...
Go get Marie.
Here.
- What's that?
- It's his.
Keep it as a souvenir.
Now go get Marie.
You handled yourself well.
If you want, you can join my gang.
There's a vacancy.
Thanks, but I don't need a nanny.
Don't you?
You know,
we keep our mouths shut,
but there might be a leak.
I know.
But if you're with us,
no one would rat on you.
Have it your own way.
You were good.
Guillaume.
Hey, baker.
The deceased there...
Take him out that way.
Make sure you aren't seen.
I'm leaving.
Don't try to figure women out.
So long.
C'mon, Jo.
Give us a hand.
You smoke, I hope?
Already?
- Introduce us.
- We're leaving.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, mister.
'Night, Felix.
You'll excuse me.
I'll see you all tomorrow.
But come a bit later.
I might need to get some sleep.
- Where's the fire?
- Exactly, there is one.
Muggy night, ain't it?
Just a minute.
Sorry, I didn't say goodbye.
I can come see you tomorrow.
Are you kidding me?
Nobody move!
Everyone stays where they are.
Get the hell out of here!
The cops!
Hey, you! Come here!
Sergeant, there's a stiff here.
He's done for, all right.
Take him inside.
Boss,
we'd like to pay and leave.
I'm very sorry, folks.
All of this is beyond my control.
But we want to leave.
Excuse me,
but did you people see anything?
What could we have noticed?
Did you witness a brawl?
An argument?
No, why?
We just found a body.
Here it comes.
It's your dance partner!
What?
So sorry, ladies.
What a rumpus.
And the carpenter?
He's okay.
Where is he?
On his way home.
And tomorrow?
He'll clear out.
Over here.
What?
Someone ratted on us.
Thanks for the tip.
You know who it was?
I'll tell you tomorrow. Go on.
Scram!
Move along!
Run, I said!
Marie!
My name's Madeleine,
but we can work something out.
Good luck.
If you're leaving because of her...
No, it's just best that I leave.
Oh, well...
Here.
You paid what you owed me.
Take it anyway.
I'll leave now.
Goodbye.
And thanks.
Are you Mr. Manda?
- Yes, why?
- It's really you?
I said yes.
For you.
- Who gave you this?
- Somebody I don't know.
"Go to Ma Eugene's place in Joinville,
near the old bridge.
"I have to talk to you.
Raymond"
You little rascals!
Good, isn't it?
Let your brother eat.
Beg your pardon.
Are you Madam Eugene?
Why? What do you want?
I'm here to see Raymond.
There's no one here.
But he wrote me to meet him here.
He must've mentioned me. I'm Manda.
Go look down by the river.
In a boat?
Maybe.
He might've taken my old boat out.
Can I leave my stuff?
Go ahead.
'Morning, ma'am.
You made coffee.
That's nice of you.
Don't pour any just yet.
She's still asleep.
This late?
Is there any coffee?
Take it to her while it's hot.
'Morning.
You hit it off.
Is it that obvious?
At my age, you get
to know what's what.
This is swell.
I'm staying here.
Give me your stick.
Kiss me, Manda.
Hurry on home.
My husband and I
will come by tomorrow.
Thanks, Madam Gabriel.
I won't forget your kindness.
Hurry on home.
- I won't forget this.
- Don't mention it.
She's poor Anatole's grandma.
What happened to him?
He's dead.
Dead?
They found him
with his head crushed.
Under some scaffolding.
It fell on him.
- Where?
- Nearby.
Today, on his way to work.
You saw the accident?
No one saw it.
No one was around.
There aren't many folks
out that early.
Isn't that sad.
Anatole was a nice fellow.
Show him the photo.
Good picture of him.
He was so glad
to be in the photo with us.
He was a hard worker.
Honest, dedicated.
It's always the best who go.
Here, take up a collection
for his grandma.
- That's kind of you.
- Not at all.
Noon already. My partner's due.
Serve me in the back, as usual.
Sure, Mr. Leca, and thanks.
If only everyone was like him.
There's no finer guy.
Imagine that! A gold coin!
Here's 40 centimes. Top that.
Poor Anatole.
It went all right?
A cinch.
Not a soul in sight.
Who's winning?
He is, as usual.
For poor Anatole's grandmother.
You must be kidding.
You have to give.
Hey, Fredo...
You give, too.
What for?
For Anatole's grandma.
- So, it's done?
- And how.
In that case...
I found Marie. And Manda.
No one's listening.
- Go on.
- They're together.
- I know, but where?
Sorry. They're in Joinville
at Ma Eugène's.
Okay. Now beat it.
Fredo.
Here.
Hello, my pet.
- Watch it!
- What?
Queen, jack and master spade.
Will that do?
If I were you, I'd watch her.
Raymond isn't pleased.
Let's go, Paulo. I'm hungry.
- Come eat with us?
- No thanks, I'm staying.
You coming or not?
Coming! See you later.
Felix, you got a minute?
Yes, but make it quick.
Quick. I'm meeting my cop.
Listen, Felix...
You want Marie, right?
Why ask me that?
You'll never get her
if you hurt Manda.
Mind your own business.
Hands off Manda.
You two are such buddies?
Yep, and old friends.
I didn't know.
I can count on Manda.
That's pretty rare.
You don't say.
It's no laughing matter.
Poor jerk.
I don't care about your Manda.
Glad to hear it.
Scram, here's my cop.
Hello, my friend.
Nice weather, isn't it?
We're being spoiled this season.
- Boss, a backgammon board.
- And two absinthes.
So, life's good?
See the fellow going out?
I think he killed a man.
What will it be?
We said, two absinthes.
Sorry,
I wasn't paying attention.
We can take a walk later,
if you're free.
I'm at your disposal.
It's not Sunday.
Must be a funeral.
Come in.
Let's go.
It's a wedding. Let's watch.
Do it for me.
- Oh, all right.
Shall we go?
Do you love me, Manda?
Let's go.
See that?
- It's Felix.
- Sure enough.
He's waving to us.
He seems in a good mood.
That's funny.
What's he doing here?
We'll find out.
Visiting the priest?
When's the wedding?
That'd give you a shock.
No, why should it?
Everyone's got a right to marry.
Right, Fredo?
I didn't know you like to fish.
Did you catch a lot?
Just some small fry.
We mainly came out for the air.
It's a nice little spot here.
You staying a while?
Maybe. We don't know. Why?
If you like it here,
make the most of it.
We have to be getting back.
Be seeing you.
Enjoy yourselves.
By the way...
No, I was talking to Manda.
You can go back to town.
The danger's past.
Why's that?
They arrested someone else.
Who?
Raymond.
I forgot, he's your buddy.
When was this?
Yesterday.
Don't worry, he won't talk.
Well, so long.
My day's done. I'm turning in.
Good night, all.
Come to bed, Manda.
Stop thinking about it.
Think about me.
I always think about you.
Where's Manda?
He left an hour ago.
And you didn't wake me.
You're crazy!
How was I supposed to know?
He went to get the newspaper.
Yes, over there.
And then he came back.
- And?
He left the newspaper
on the table for you.
I forgot,
he gave me 100 francs.
For you.
"Raymond 'The Baker' stupidly
continues to deny his guilt,
"despite overwhelming evidence.
"He was in possession of objects
belonging to the victim:
"A gold watch with his initials,
"and an elegant switchblade knife
"with an ivory handle and coat
of arms bearing his initials."
So, what do we do?
We can't leave Raymond locked up
because of this Manda!
Right, Guillaume?
They could learn other things.
Next thing you know,
we're all in hot water.
Not at all.
Anyway, one thing's certain.
They'll never suspect it was Manda
on their own.
So what?
Raymond certainly
isn't going to squeal.
But you will, maybe?
Why not?
No, sir. That isn't done.
Not among us.
But Manda isn't one of us.
How do you know?
Not a carpenter.
So? I think he's a regular guy.
He won't risk the guillotine.
What do you know?
Go see who it is.
Is Felix in?
You want to see him?
He's upstairs.
If it isn't Marie!
Come in.
Come in.
You alone? What's up?
Cat got your tongue?
Manda turned himself in.
We have to talk, Felix.
We'll be going.
It'll all work out.
It's not like you to cry, Marie.
Only you can help me.
Be glad to.
But it's up to you.
What do you say?
Captain.
Nothing in particular?
Inspector Giuliani
wants to see you.
There's something new
in the Roland Dupuis case.
So...
This man claims
he killed Roland Dupuis.
I just took his statement.
Did you finish reading it?
Yes, sir.
Let me see.
Bring him in.
Are these the facts?
Sign it.
Here.
Hello, Raymond.
What are you doing here?
Take him away.
Let's go.
Stand over there.
"Your Leca was badly misinformed!"
Captain!
Feel free!
Getting the killer
doesn't mean you're free.
Recognize these?
Accessory to murder, fella.
You'll explain it to the judge.
It's out of our hands now.
You look surprised.
And how!
It's in the paper.
They're taking him
to La Santé prison.
Today or tomorrow. Look.
Isn't it time to act?
- Want us to attack the paddywagon?
- Why not?
In broad daylight?
Sorry, madam.
Not even for your pretty face.
You're a real louse!
You're a louse! You hear me?
If my pals show up,
tell them I couldn't wait.
They can meet me
at the bistro at 1:00.
Let's get going.
Move it.
Wait.
Come on out.
- Hi, Jo.
- No talking.
- It's not allowed?
- Shut up.
Move it.
Here are the goods.
You have their things, sergeant?
- So long.
- Go on.
Where are you going?
- To give them this.
- You can't!
- It's cake and cigarettes.
- They can't smoke.
Hold on!
The cake, at least.
You can keep the cigarettes.
Give me the cake.
What is this? C'mon!
Get in!
Here are their things.
See his girl?
I wouldn't mind her.
If you can afford her.
What was that?
If you can afford her.
Jo!
I hear you.
Listen.
It's Leca who turned me in.
I found out this morning.
He did it to trick you,
so he could have Marie.
- You sure it's here?
- Pretty sure.
We should've followed them.
Don't worry. Here they come.
Here are the prisoners' things.
What're you waiting for?
Don't! You'll hit Martin!
Get down, for God's sake!
Well, I'll be!
Where's Leca?
I dunno. Must be at home.
We need a doctor.
I have Raymond. He's dying.
Go get a doctor.
So long, Raymond.
- Call Leca.
- He's not here.
- Get him.
- I'm alone.
Where do you think you are?
I told you he's not here.
He's gone.
What?
I want to see Inspector Giuliani.
- He's not in.
- What's it about?
Arrest him!
Don't you recognize him?
Here we are.
Keep the change.
- Can we go up?
- Payment in advance.
I figured as much.
I can't leave you the lamp.
It's the best view
of the boulevard.
You can leave when it's over.
I'm going back to bed.
You shouldn't, Marie.
Go, if you want.
No way!
Shoulder arms!
