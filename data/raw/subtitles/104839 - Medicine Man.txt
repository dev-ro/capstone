Good-bye now. Enjoy your stay.
The foundation for whom I work
supports a botanist
named Robert Campbell,
once of some note.
But on separating from his wife
and longtime research partner,
he'd withdrawn his station
deeper into the bush.
And until last month's message,
no one had heard
from him in three years.
He asked for an assistant
and a gas chromatograph,
and pointedly refused
to say why.
I'm surprised
that they sent a woman...
For Dr. Campbell.
Please don't lose it.
Wait a minute.
Aren't you coming with me?
I'm afraid
he was adamant about that.
Tanaki will guide you from here.
Come on, you!
Go! Hyah!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Careful.
Are we here?
Okay, ready?
Here you go.
Indian?!
Boy.
Who are you?
Who am I? Who are you?
I asked you first.
You're Dr. Campbell, right?
I know who the hell I am.
I'm asking who you are.
Crane.
No, no, toucan.
No, that's my name.
Toucan? How odd.
Crane. Dr. Rae Crane.
I do wish
you'd make up your mind.
Now where did you go?
Maybe it's best we talk
in the morning, doctor.
This is from Ornega.
How about a place to sleep?
Ornega?
You from Aston?
They sent you?
I tell you they send a girl.
They sent a girl?
Yes.
I'm not a girl!
The hell you're not.
I'm your research assistant.
The hell you are.
And where's your mask?
I don't have a mask.
I just got here.
No one comes in here
without a surgical mask.
God knows what bugs
you're carrying.
Jahausa, get her a mask.
Hey, relax.
This is as close
as we get, Tonto.
Not for me, you hussy!
For the Indians! Hussy?!
One outsider coming
in here with a common cold
can decimate an entire tribe.
And what about your shots?
What about a place
to sleep, god damn it?
To sleep?! Sleep!
Sleep... well...
Yes, of course.
Please forgive me.
There's no need for you
to leave till tomorrow.
I must tell you
how grateful I am.
I've been waiting for these.
They get lost in the forest,
you see?
The forest is so vast and...
And we're just so very small.
Dr. Campbell?
No, no, no, palala.
Back to the boat. Back, back.
Hey!
Back it up. Back it up.
You had no right
to unpack that equipment.
Where you going? No, no, no.
No, that's all right.
He's loading the boat.
No, no boat.
Palala, only
those boxes are staying.
No, no, come on.
Come on. Up, up.
Up, down. Luggage down.
Come on, put it down.
Hey, would you do me a favor
and ask him
to put my luggage down?
Sorry.
I forgot women like
to carry their own now.
I think I should
introduce myself.
Well, you're the so-called
research assistant
from Aston?
You remember last night?
Do I appear senile?
Drunk.
Intoxicated, yes.
There's a difference.
The peach palm festival
is the religious ceremony.
Are those bags too heavy?
Shall I call palala back?
No.
I'm not getting on a boat.
No boat.
I'm afraid it's
the only available transport,
and you certainly
can't remain here.
Why, because I'm not a man?
Because you're
not one of three men.
I requested Dr. Alan sealove,
and if he was unavailable,
Dr. Gregory Hoffman.
I'm published more extensively
than Dr. Sealove.
I hold degrees from ccny,
Berkeley, and Cambridge.
I'm the recipient
of the thurman award...
In '82 and '86.
The first and only time
it's ever been given
to the same person twice.
Is there anything else
you'd like to know about me?
Do those boots come
with a manual?
No.
I thought of snakes.
When's the last time
you did field research?
Or when's the first time?
I did a month in la salve.
A whole month?
Palala?
You didn't need me.
You needed a caddy.
Palala will caddy your bags
to the boat.
You send me back
on the basis of my gender.
It's called sex discrimination.
Look, I understand
your reservations.
I heard about your wife.
My wife?
Good god.
She left me.
I wish you'd follow her example.
Are we finished?
You have a boat to catch.
No boat!
I want a meal and a bath!
This isn't a hotel.
I'll leave
when I'm damn well ready.
I know. After a meal and a bath.
I'm not a 19-year-old
grad student
working up a resume,
and I don't expect
to be treated as if I were.
I'm hungry, I'm tired...
And I've been in these clothes
for more than one dance.
Palala will see
that you get some breakfast.
I said, "and a bath."
Unbutton your shirt.
Excuse me?
You want to bathe
in their water supply,
you'll take a medical first.
Sit down, here.
Is he gonna watch?
Don't you want a nurse present?
I'll risk it.
Well, I won't.
Deep breath.
Now I understand why
you've been so secretive
about your research here.
Again.
You've found the cure
for the common hangover.
Look up.
Left... right.
Open your mouth.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Say, "Aah"
see your connector.
My what?
It's in your passport.
Your vaccine card.
God.
This is completely unnecessary.
The principle cause
of death among aboriginals
is imported disease.
What do you see?
I thought we did
the eye examination.
Come on.
You won two thurman awards.
Show off.
What am I analyzing?
Did you run a baseline?
No.
Next time, run a baseline
to calibrate the machine.
There's a glucose solution
specifically for that.
Is that the substance
you're analyzing?
Yes.
What is it, a plant extract?
Full marks.
Continue.
Okay.
We're looking at...
49 compounds.
Okay, what we've got here is...
Where was I? Okay, 49 compounds.
No, no, nope.
Nearly all of these
are identifiable.
In short, nothing new.
Is this why you wanted
the chromatograph?
You said,
"nearly all identifiable."
Yeah.
Just this one, peak 37.
Looks like an acid derivative.
Although those side...
You must have really thought
you were onto something.
I'm sorry.
Can it be synthesized?
This one's
mother nature's kitchen.
End of story.
Why?
What is it you think you've got?
I don't think.
I know. Share it.
What's the problem?
Even as a child,
he didn't like to share.
It's deep-seated, I suppose.
What is it, a secret?
I'll cross my heart
and spit on the floor.
You said breakfast and a bath?
Palala?
Hey, you saving it for sealove?
Don't. He's not coming.
Then I'll settle for Robinson.
You were lucky you got me
and last year's chromatograph.
I give up.
I believe our deal was bath,
breakfast, and boat.
I didn't come here
to make deals!
Then why did you come here?
I'll leave the chromatograph
for the time being.
I'm asking you a question.
You have no idea, have you?
Aston's considering
pulling your funds
and shipping you out.
I'm your judge and jury.
Winslow would never permit that.
Winslow!
Winslow retired last year.
If you hadn't cut off incoming,
you would have known that.
Who replaced him?
Me.
You don't give progress reports!
You move your damn
station wherever
and whenever you like!
You know, we need
a record of expenses!
And you don't respond
to requests for information!
So here I am!
So here I am!
Put this on.
I wanna show you something.
I've seen it.
Put it on!
Please.
Follow me.
This is kalana...
Wife of jahausa,
mother of imana.
Palpate her throat.
I'm not a medic.
Good god, woman.
Must everything be a full-scale
debate with you?
Just do it.
Feel anything?
Nothing.
Six months ago
she came to see me.
Couple of lumps in her throat.
I sent her downriver
with a franciscan missionary
to the hospital there,
and she made her own way back.
Took her a month.
And the nodes were
almost double the size.
Depswa.
Two injections
of that sample you just tested,
and the lumps disappeared
within a week.
No boosters. No side effects.
That's just swell.
What am I supposed to report
to the foundation?
Dr. Campbell
showed me a cured patient
who claims a history
of undiagnosed,
undocumented lumps
in her throat?
Hey!
Look, I'm tired...
Here it is.
A scan report.
She brought it back
from manicobe.
That's delightful.
I'll bring it with me if you'll
contact Dr. Ornega...
"Anterior
and posterior lymphomas."
Here.
Check her biopsy report.
What for?
It could be anybody's.
Okay.
You think I'm lying?
I think you're
a man who's allowed
his personal problems
get in the way
of his clinical judgment.
That's what I think.
Stay.
Stay?
Stay? He talks to me like a dog.
500,000 scientists
in this world,
and I end up with Dr. Mengele
with a ponytail.
Now what?!
Good god.
Feel that?
What is it?
A supraclavicular node.
Malignant.
How do you know?
I gave it to him.
Transplanted tissue.
I gave it to them all.
You will biopsy the lot.
I insist.
That is your control group.
And this lucky bugger
gets an injection
by nightfall and tomorrow,
in the morning,
you will examine him.
Come on!
I'm not proposing marriage.
I'm asking you to biopsy
a family of rodents.
Spend 12 hours in a perfectly
luxurious hammock.
Now you don't have
to think about that.
Just nod.
Where's the ball?
No ball.
Here.
There. Hold it.
There.
What was in the tin?
The boys, you were giving them
something from the tin.
Candy-coated ants.
You want some?
The tin is inside on the table.
I'll pass.
What about you?
What is it?
Freeze-dried ice cream.
I'll pass.
Come on.
The astronauts eat it.
Doesn't taste like ice cream.
When's the last time
you had a double dip?
The palate remembers.
That woman, kalana?
She called you something.
"Depswa."
"Depswa"?
What's it mean?
"Medicine man."
That's me.
Don't they have one
of their own?
What?
Medicine man.
I gave alka-seltzer
to a kid with a belly ache.
You did what?
Alka-seltzer cured
him with one belch.
But it was the,
"plop, plop, fizz, fizz,"
that really dazzled them.
The medicine man was
understandably pissed off.
I had taken his stick.
Stick?
His self-respect.
His place.
So he just took off.
My intentions were well meant,
but...
You take the hammock.
I'll sleep in the greenhouse.
Well, if I need anything,
I'll let you know.
You will?
Good.
Thank you.
Dr. Campbell?
Already?
My name is Dr. Crane. Rae Crane.
Just in case you need to,
address me directly.
I thought I'd just call you
"Brooklyn."
I'm from the Bronx.
Well, the Bronx.
Doesn't quite roll off
the tongue, does it?
Good night.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm covering my ass.
I don't want you accusing me
of playing switcheroo
with your control group.
I get it.
Peach palm festival, day two.
No.
No festival.
Just a bedtime story.
You're staring at me.
Your pajamas.
I haven't seen pajamas in...
A long time.
Jesus!
What is it now?
God.
It's all right.
That's Henry.
He keeps the place free of rats.
Come on, old dear. Come on.
Look, I'll sleep with lizards,
and I'll sleep
with Guinea pigs...
I understand.
A girl has to draw
the line somewhere.
Come on, old dear.
Sweet dreams.
Go to hell.
Probably.
No, do you?
Why do you think that?
That's very funny.
Dr. Campbell!
Dr. Campbell!
Dr. Campbell!
Imana.
Good stuff, both of you.
Campbell!
Jesus, Campbell.
I know.
You know?
You know.
You've found the cure for cancer
and all you can say is,
"I know"?
What is it?
Bromeliad.
The flower.
How'd you find it?
Get dressed.
Okay.
I came here six years ago.
Why?
A freak tribe.
No cancer.
What about the woman
you showed me?
No, jahausa married
outside the tribe.
Kalana's an exoti.
Then it's genetic.
No, no, no. It's environmental.
The tribes have always
intermarried.
But as far as I can tell,
the bromeliad
doesn't grow anywhere
except here.
So the exoti don't use it.
Kalana still doesn't
put it in their food.
She says it tastes bad.
So they eat this flower?
Ingest it.
Snuff and,
sometimes chewing tobacco.
Well, it's in most
of their food.
Grows wild, a hundred feet up
in the canopy.
Ten stories up?
On the top shelf
of the pharmacological
superstore.
Lives off a tree.
I'd seen the old medicine man
up there
gathering for his juju kit.
And there it was.
There's only one fly
in the serum.
I can't reproduce it.
What do you mean?
None of the new samples work.
And I have very little
of the original serum left.
That's what I mean when I say
I can't reproduce it.
Wait a minute.
I don't understand.
What don't you understand?!
I found a cure for the fuckin' plague...
of the 20th century,
and now I've lost it!
Haven't you ever lost anything, Dr. Bronx?
Your purse, your car keys?
Well, it's rather like that.
Now you have it. Now you don't.
Your notes are gone?
I have my notes.
I followed my notes.
Your notes must be wrong.
They're not.
Then explain it.
I... I can't.
Okay.
The first thing I do
when I get to L.A.
Is I get Dr. Crowson.
His people can set
up a real lab down here.
There's nothing wrong
with this lab.
We've got everything we need.
Look...
This is major league.
You need help.
I promise you will get
full credit.
Do you think I give a damn
about the immortal
textbook quote?
Dare I insult you
with a history lesson?
No, better still,
how about subtraction?
9 million Indians in the Amazon.
White men bring measles, flu,
polio, and chicken pox.
Now you've got 200,000 Indians.
Without using your fingers,
just how many did we shove
in the hole?
It's not they'll
be unvaccinated.
These people would be
working for Aston.
All precautions would be taken.
You don't remember Mocara, do you?
You're too young.
Some overeager son of a bitch...
found a great little painkiller
in the jungle.
$0.15 to make a $5 bottle.
Aston was onto it
like a fly to dung.
All very scientific.
All precautions taken.
Swine flu killed
the entire village.
Much regret. So sorry.
But the eager beaver still ended
up with his $0.10 on the dollar.
This isn't a painkiller.
This is the cure for cancer.
These people don't
need a cure for cancer.
Ask them.
There's a road
coming into the area.
You're finished.
Aston can stop that.
Aston will need the road.
They'll make sure that it leads
right up to my "palapa".
How can I go...
How can you go back
when I need you here?
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm a damn good biochemist.
I'm not a field researcher.
I haven't done
this work for years.
I'm not qualified.
I know.
Too many foundation fundraisers.
Too many subcommittees.
Take two Guinea pigs
and call me in the morning.
Well, when you're old and gray,
you'll put lilies on my grave
and wish you could thank me.
Yeah, well, I'll thank you now,
but I'm still leaving.
How?
Campbell...
I'm not your prisoner.
No, you're
my research assistant.
You're not afraid of heights,
are you, Bronx?
Right foot. And up.
There you are.
You give the cutaway
a good yank...
And up you go.
Well, come on.
I want you to see.
Come on.
All right.
Dr. Bronx.
Left leg first.
There.
Now the right.
There you are.
This up here.
All right?
Come on.
God.
Think of Neil Armstrong.
All right.
I'll give you one week.
Did you hear me?
They're not in abundance.
If you find one,
plop it in the bag.
Are you gonna tell me
what they look like?
Yes.
Like this.
Whatever this flower needs
to fertilize,
it gets it up here.
Whether it's a an air stream
being transferred
by an insect for the pollen,
or god knows what
leaking out of the tree...
Could be anything.
It could be everything.
That's the beauty
of this system.
You can't beat it.
You can only wipe it out.
Is that the road?
You see the river?
No one can remember it
ever being this low.
What about all the rain?
Every year it rains less.
Less rainforest means less rain.
The Indians have asked me
to pray for a deluge.
Do you pray, Bronx?
There's so much smoke.
I didn't know the road
was so close.
Yes, well,
death is inevitable, Dr. Bronx.
But it's considered bad form
to discuss it
over a man's sick-bed,
all right?
Yeah, well, closing your eyes
won't make it disappear.
Neither will talk.
Let's go.
You're a lunatic.
I'll show you a shortcut!
God, god.
When was it made?
What?
The eighth sample,
when was it made?
Data sheets.
Green notebook, top left.
You don't smoke, do you?
No, I quit.
Good god. Why?
They've been missing from
the last three shipments.
I suspect jahausa's got
something to do with it.
Your other left.
Last one.
Okay, look.
Here's the original extract,
the one that works.
Here's the eight subsequent ones
that don't work.
You notice anything?
I'll give you a hint.
It's missing
from every failed sample.
Peak 37.
Did you vary the solution?
No.
You think the bromeliad
changes chemistry
during its life cycle?
It's not impossible.
But all these samples are dated
within two weeks of each other.
Maybe the first batch
was contaminated.
Maybe peak 37 is a fungus.
No, I screened every sample,
including the first one.
Yeah, well, maybe you used
a dirty test tube.
Who knows?
There's gotta be
a thousand variations
on this plant extract
and we've gotta make and test
every single one of them.
I tell you, we need help.
We're looking at
too many possibilities.
Isn't that what science
is all about?
Eliminating possibilities?
Well?
You said you needed help.
Okay, Jahausa, can you tell them
that I need them
to break it from the root?
Keep that root.
How we doing?
Tell her if she breaks
the leaves, it's easier.
If she breaks them...
See, they're too big.
Imana, what are you doing
in my way?
How you doing?
Good.
This is excellent.
Hi, are you breaking them
from the roots?
You gotta break 'em
from the roots, okay?
It's kalana. Hi.
Okay.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.
Depswa!
It's all right.
He just wants to know if
you have a date for the prom,
euphemistically speaking.
Why are they staring at me?
They've never seen
a virgin of your maturity.
What?
I had to give them some excuse.
Well, you should have said,
"she's engaged to be married."
Really?
It's to be Mrs. Bronx?
It will be next winter.
I don't approve
of long engagements.
We woulda liked to have
gotten married earlier,
but it wasn't convenient.
A marriage of convenience.
You probably know him,
or at least his family.
Tom fallon?
Tommy fallon?
Good god, he's about
95 years old.
You'll inherit
before the honeymoon's over.
I take my hat off to you, girl.
His son.
His son?
No, I don't know the son,
but I can well imagine.
Good stock.
Good contributor.
Met at a fundraiser, did we?
What's the difference
where I met him?
Don't get your knickers
in a twist, Mrs. Bronx.
Just remember, breeding is
no substitute for intelligence.
Often the death of it.
What do you have,
an unlimited supply
of that stuff?
The saliva speeds up
the fermentation process.
Pass.
Well, you might as well.
You can't test this lot
for another 72 hours.
It'll go by just as fast
if we're testing
the local fungus.
I told you
I screened every sample.
Well, there is another
possibility.
Which is?
A six-pack of peach "pear-nod,"
and you were drunker
than a skunk
when you did the test.
Pernod.
The "d" is silent.
If you're gonna hang around
with the fallons,
you better get it right, kid.
Pernod.
Thank you, doctor.
Shall I write it down for you?
What if the missing step
isn't here in the lab?
Your medicine man,
the first day you saw him
collect the bromeliads,
what if he did something?
I don't know.
Something you instinctively
copied that first time
and haven't done since.
What if it's in the harvesting?
I counted at least
three what-ifs.
Yeah, well, you don't start
an investigation
with, "once upon a time,"
do you?
Exactly what are you
going to investigate?
Not what, who.
Your merry men must know
where the medicine man is.
We should go and question him.
As you yourself pointed out,
you're scarcely
a qualified field researcher.
And as you've pointed out,
research is a process
of elimination.
Don't you presume
to tell me how to follow up.
"Question the medicine man."
Good god.
Don't you think I questioned
the son of a bitch?
Ocupado. Ocupado!
Somewhere else!
Relax. Relax.
They know not to urinate
in the water.
That's not my concern.
Well, it should be.
Urine attracts
the spiky candiru.
It's a relatively tiny fish
that enters
any available orifice.
Look, can't you blow a whistle?
Maybe they'd like
to fetch some golf balls?
The spikes are angled backwards
and have
to be surgically removed.
It's a hell of a procedure.
I came to apologize.
Are you serious?
I lost my temper.
About the spikes?
No, about the medicine man.
God damn it, Campbell.
The spiky candiru.
Good god, where?
Hey!
Must admit I've never
actually seen one
this far upriver,
but it's not a bad idea
to keep your knickers on.
Well, all gone.
Satisfied?
I didn't mean to jump down
your throat this afternoon.
Well, then I accept
your apology.
Let's forget it.
The... the medicine man,
he wouldn't answer my questions
until I got up to leave,
and then he spoke one word.
Mocara.
The swine flu epidemic?
You told me.
Yeah.
Well, they...
He was afraid, you see,
because in mocara,
their medicine man had shared
forbidden juju magic
with the eager beaver...
And swine flu was
the gods' punishment
for that indiscretion.
All right.
He wouldn't talk.
He might talk to me.
A woman?
Look, what do you wanna do?
Sit on your hands for three days
and pray for peak 37?
We could take jahausa.
He could plead our case.
You could say you're sorry.
I don't think
he knows it was me.
I meant sorry
for the Alka-Seltzer.
Thought you meant mocara.
Depswa.
Imana.
Imana.
Imana.
Same story as the mother.
Supraclavicular node, non-tender...
And adhering
to the surrounding tissues.
How big would you say?
One centimeter.
Then give it two.
You can't and you know it.
It's so close to his windpipe
he'll choke to death before
the cancer kills him.
It's not a weed. It's a tumor.
It can wait.
It's not a tumor. It's a child.
The child can wait too.
You use up the last bit
of the working serum,
and we have nothing.
You can't use the last of it.
We know the molecule.
A picture!
A ghost in the machine!
For Christ's sake, Campbell,
use your head!
The boy won't die
in the next 48 hours.
Look, one of those beakers
sprout peak 37,
you can give samples away
for Christmas.
I'll help you wrap.
Suppose the new serums
don't work?
You said yourself
you found the cure
for the plague of this century.
It belongs to the human race,
not to one sick kid.
Depswa?
Come on, gimme that syringe.
It'll be my sleepless night.
Jahausa's taking his son
to the medicine man.
When she woke up this morning,
they were both gone.
She wants me to bring them back.
Medicine man?
Kalana,
where's the medicine man?
What is she saying?
Saying jahausa's a fool...
Who can show us where
the medicine man is?
Palala.
Palala? Palala can show us.
Can't hear you!
Look, get out of there!
If we leave now,
we can catch up to jahausa!
Can't hear you!
You got some history...
Fine, it's history.
What are you gonna do?
Drag it around
the rest of your life?
If that man has answers,
we need them!
I can't hear...
Can you hear me now?
What is it?
Headache.
Keep your eyes on the ground,
you won't change focus,
you won't get a headache.
You might have
mentioned it earlier.
Didn't I?
I'm sorry, I thought I did.
Palala?
No. I got something better.
Give it.
No, no.
What is it?
Yoko tree.
The bark is 3% pure caffeine.
Cures headaches, fatigue,
aches, pains,
neuritis, neuralgia.
Drink it.
It'll keep you on your feet
till dinnertime.
Pass.
Drink it. Pass.
Drink it...
Or palala will
force you on your back,
close your nose, while I
pour it down your gullet.
Isn't that right, palala?
"Gullet."
Go ahead.
What's the name of this bark?
It's called yoko.
Yoko.
You know, this would knock
Maxwell house
right off the shelf...
If the narcs wouldn't stop me
at the border.
This isn't a hallucinogen is it?
Which peak is his?
None of the above.
The old man lives
at the base of the gorge.
Downhill.
Yeah.
Hey, we've gotta talk
about marketing this stuff.
hey, of course you'd have
to add sugar!
Your version tastes like shh...
Man!
They don't spit
in this one, do they?
Spit? No, but...
Okay, don't tell me.
Really, don't tell me.
hey, have you
broken it down yet?
Look at that!
If I were the medicine man,
I would have taken that penthouse.
Why does he live at the bottom?
To get away from the constant
gabbing, most likely.
Sorry for disturbing you.
You all right?
I'm okay.
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
That "yocola" sounds too much
like a kid's drink.
I'm more interested
in the mass marketing...
Okay.
I'm more interested in the mass
marketing of this drink
for the adult, like
a continental, suave thing.
Is it difficult...
To process that yoko bark?
Bronx?
Where are you?
I'm all right.
Don't play silly buggers.
Where are you?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
I'm okay.
Stay where you are.
I'm gonna lower a harness.
Palala?
Secure it to the tree.
You've been to the circus?
Well, this is a piece of cake
compared to the triple.
You can tell your kids
you worked without a net.
Next time they're
not gonna believe you.
All right, here we go.
Use your left hand.
You can reach the harness.
Now come on.
Reach back for the harness.
It's all right. It's all right.
Don't cry.
Look, I promise you,
when this is over
you can cry all you want,
and I won't say a word.
Now come on.
Reach for the harness.
No, I can't do it.
Change of plan.
Mohammed goes to the mountain.
Palala?
The triple's easier.
All right, girl, here I come.
All right, you okay?
No!
It's okay. Just let go.
Let go.
I can't pull it!
You don't have to.
We'll both go down together.
It's a hell of a shortcut.
God!
Look...
If I wanted to kill both of us,
I coulda found easier ways, no?
Now come on. Roll.
Let go.
Come on. Let go!
Rae, let go!
Come on.
Okay. Roll!
Okay. Come on!
Ha-ha!
You did it, aye.
You're okay.
Descend. Down.
Come on.
Come on. There you go.
Nothing?
Come on.
I think I hate you.
Faster. Let it go.
Come on.
I can't look.
Come on. I can't look.
Don't look. Move your rope.
Work your hands.
What happened?
Nothing happened.
What happened?
What happened?!
You're okay. Calm...
Just take your time. Calm down.
What did you do?
What do we do now?
This is a rescue?
This is a rescue?!
What's the matter with you?!
What am I supposed to do,
call 911?!
You idiot!
Don't! No!
Calm down.
Gimme your hand.
This isn't a rescue.
This is a suicide pact!
You idiot!
Calm down! Hey, gimme your hand.
Just gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand!
What for? What are you, crazy?
Well done.
God.
Don't cry.
You were marvelous. Really.
It was the best I've ever seen.
And I've been to the circus
a great many times?
You were spectacular, really.
Come on.
Don't cry.
You promised
I could cry all I want.
Yes, I did.
Okay.
Well, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.
Fortunately,
palala salvaged your haversack.
Careful.
That's peach pernod.
I lost it up there.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'm trying to thank you.
That was a good job.
Enough said.
Go easy on it?
Why?
I'm not driving.
Or walking, apparently.
No wonder why you like
this stuff.
Don't make me laugh.
God!
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts.
Here we go.
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold still.
That burns.
I know. What is it?
It's... it's magic.
Burning. Magic.
Magic!
Yes, that old black magic
has got me in its spell.
And, the black magic
that you weave so well.
I know. Terrifying, isn't it?
Icy fingers
up and down your spine.
Down my spine?
all right, bedtime.
Come on. Sing it.
Sing it, Campbell.
Really big finish.
Come on, sing us a bar.
Come on.
come on, sing it.
Get some sleep, rae.
Don't!
What?
Don't call me by my given name.
Don't you like it?
Yeah, I like it.
Campbell?
Ready for visitors?
The medicine man?
He's in the neighborhood.
How do you know?
Call it a hunch.
We might be in the wrong gorge.
Somehow I doubt that.
I mean, are you sure palala
knows where he lives?
Yeah.
What if he doesn't?
What do we do then?
I thought I was dreaming.
Campbell, I thought...
Okay, what's going on?
It seems there's going
to be a fight.
Between you and him?
He's three feet tall,
for Christ's sake.
You wanted to pick his brains.
Not off the sidewalk.
Ever mouth off to the Dean,
and then need a Grant?
This is a eat-crow,
kiss-ass contest?
Exactly.
Remember what I told you
about taking his stick?
I think this is
about giving it back.
So he's gotta win?
Okay.
Bend over, take three whacks,
and let's cut to the info.
It doesn't quite work that way.
The tricky part is...
Is what?
Not getting my skull cracked
in the process.
Tell him his mother
eats army boots.
He's what happens
when cousins marry!
For Christ's sake...
I was helping.
Well, don't!
I don't need
a bloody interpreter.
I do.
Don't push your luck, runt.
Campbell.
Yeah. Nice kiss.
What?
What'd he say? What'd he say?
What'd he say? What'd he say?
Back to square one.
Where did I go wrong?
The eating crow
or the kissing ass department?
It wasn't a total loss.
My, my.
Isn't it all bright and shiny?
I cleaned up a little,
that's all.
These first four extracts
will be ready to test by 7:00.
I'll set my alarm clock
for 6:30.
Incidentally,
the blue doesn't come off.
Get drunk somewhere else.
Hey, I live here.
Get sanctimonious
somewhere else.
I tried to get drunk
at jahausa's,
as a matter of fact.
But I soon tired
of hearing him pray
over his only son.
So I said to myself,
"why not visit Dr. Bronx
and her tabernacle
of empirical evidence?"
I'm not a monster, Campbell.
No, you're not a monster.
And if I have in any way
labeled you monstrous
by gesture or manner,
I sincerely beg your pardon.
I'd like to go to sleep now.
I have an early morning.
I wouldn't bother setting
that alarm, monster Bronx.
He won't make it
through the night.
You don't know that.
Hey, I picture you
at imana's age...
Sitting in bed, awake,
arms crossed, whispering,
"I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts."
Where was I when you were
six years of age
and armed against the dark?
Probably hiding,
like you are now.
In the jungle or in the bottle?
To which hideout
are you referring?
Does it matter?
It's not as difficult
as you might think
watching someone die.
After 70 or 80
men, women, infants...
You begin to feel quite numb.
When I left jahausa's hut,
I was coming here
to get the magic serum.
To save myself, of course.
Not the boy.
Which makes me the monster.
You, at least,
would save the world.
And the world
is not one choking boy
in the middle
of a disappearing forest.
Even though it seems
that way here in the dark,
against which you are
so well armed...
And I have only this.
Enough.
Gimme that bottle.
You're not a murderer.
That's not why she left you.
What the hell
do you know about it?
She left me...
Because I wouldn't
allow her to forgive me.
She very much wanted to do so.
But I couldn't forgive myself.
Until I do, no one...
no one's allowed.
Depswa.
We've been invited
to a prayer meeting.
I'll make your excuses.
Hi.
Kalana! Kalana!
Kalana!
Yes, yes, he's okay. He's okay.
He'll be fine.
What's going on?
Why is everyone running?
Time's up.
A miracle without proof
is only a miracle.
It do not stop bulldozers.
Look, ornega,
I injected him myself.
I'm not doubting it.
This bromeliad, I've never
seen it growing anywhere else.
You can't transplant it
to the lab.
Christ, I couldn't bring it down
100 feet from origin.
Now you move
your road through here,
and we've lost it.
Come on, Roberto.
It's not my road.
We need time.
We're testing new samples.
Senor reyes,
he has already been instructed
to move the villagers.
If a test is successful in,
say, next 24 hours...
24 hours?
The bulldozers are running
night and day now.
I'm gonna retest.
It didn't work, rae.
It's not here.
But you promised me a week.
You gave me a week.
Pack your bags, rae,
before the road gets here.
You're always throwing me out.
It's for your own good.
What do you know about it?
Quite a bit.
You don't smoke, do you?
There's gotta be a cigarette
around here somewhere.
Is this supposed to be me?
Supposed to be?
I think it's
a very good likeness.
Take it if you want.
No, I'd rather you kept it.
Well, I certainly
flattered you a bit
by idealizing your forehead,
but a man in love
wouldn't notice the disparity.
A man in love?
Yeah, Tommy fallon, the younger.
Give it to him.
I'm sure he sees your forehead
exactly as I've drawn it.
And he probably never noticed
that your left ear
is lower than your right ear.
When one is smitten,
those are the details...
What are you running?
Baseline.
What are you using?
Sugar solution.
The same solution
you've used each time?
No.
I ran out. Why?
Where'd you get the sugar?
Campbell!
Campbell!
Campbell!
Campbell!
Campbell! Campbell!
Campbell!
It's a damn poor time
for having an ironman contest.
Have you ever
lost anything, ornega?
Your car keys, your wallet?
It wasn't the bromeliads.
It was the ants.
You're certain?
I seem to have left
the evidence in my other suit.
Campbell?
Roberto.
Roberto?
It's me, Miguel.
Miguel.
We can go
whenever you are ready.
No, no, no.
I know what I'm looking for now.
If those little orange bastards
exist somewhere else...
Roberto... I'll find them.
Look at yourself.
It's time out, my friend.
Six years
and all your equipment.
Aston isn't going...
Aston will replace it,
all of it.
And provide with a research
assistant, per his request.
Dr. Sealove, if I remember,
was your first choice.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
If you are ready, we should go.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Good luck to you.
You'll be in touch.
They won't relocate where
the government has indicated.
Sooner or later,
they'll have no place left,
then they'll go
where they're told.
He says the medicine man
has found a place upriver.
Medicine man? You mean Campbell?
No, that small one over
by the trees.
Gimme a minute.
Right.
I'll tell him.
He said this was your stick.
He said it's all right now.
He's found a good place.
And if you behave yourself,
you can go with them.
He said he'll teach you
big magic.
He said he's never met
a man like you before...
And maybe he never will again.
I'm gonna need in addition
to a new chromatograph,
more scopes, calipers...
I'll make sure you get
everything you need.
When I reach the city,
I'll contact Dr. Sealove.
Well, I've reconsidered.
Dr. Sealove
is my second choice now.
Come on, Bronx.
You think Tom Fallon's gonna
walk down the aisle...
with a woman
who has something blue
as a tattoo on her forehead?
I want joint publication.
You can have whatever you want.
What do you want?
A meal and a bath.
Then unbutton your shirt.
"Dearest Tom,
we're pushing upriver"
"in search of those ants."
"And with some luck,
we'll get to them"
"before the lumber companies do."
"And about our marriage?"
"Well...
I'm not so sure
I'm ready for it yet."
Okay.
"Life is strange.
But down here..."
Hey, Bronx!
"It seems..."
Yeah?
"So very precious." Come on!
I'm coming!
