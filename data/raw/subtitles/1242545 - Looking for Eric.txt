Nurse. What time is it?
- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- Four o'clock? Jesus.
Try and sleep.
Listen, I'm really sorry about
all the fuss. I'm really sorry, yeah.
I don't know what got into me, nurse.
Eric, nobody's been hurt.
You're not hurt.
Everything's all right.
Listen, I got an early shift.
Can you get me clothes for me,
please, nurse?
You won't be going anywhere.
- Eric, it's all right.
- Can you get me clothes, please?
- Try and relax. Just lie down.
- I can't be late for work, nurse.
- It's okay.
- I can't be late.
It's all right.
I can't be late for work, nurse.
- It's okay.
- Can you get me clothes, please?
- You get to sleep. You get to sleep.
- I can't be late.
- I can't be late.
- It's okay.
Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.
Oh, God, Lily, I'm so sorry.
You take it easy.
All right, Eric?
God, what have you been up to,
you dipstick?
- Ah, I know, I know.
- You give us a right scare, you know?
Something let go.
- Did you get any broken bones or owt?
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Has he been giving you any trouble?
- I haven't. Have I?
- No, model patient. Been fine.
- Can be a bit of a bugger him, you know.
Guinness Book of Records, eh?
You what?
Three thousand times
round the same roundabout.
It's a career change, isn't it?
From postman to astronaut.
I was daydreaming.
You went round the wrong fucking way.
- You're lucky somebody wasn't killed.
- Don't. Don't.
A good night's kip
and I'll be as fit as a butcher's dog.
Where's me car?
It's like you. It's fucked.
What about the police?
I've had a word with them.
They've gotta make a report, but I don't
think they're gonna take it any further
due to your psychological condition.
Eric, if there's anything you need,
anything at all,
give me a shout, d'you hear?
Any time. Day or night. All right?
Aye. Cheers, mate. Thanks.
All right. We've just dropped
the gear off.
The van'll be here in about an hour.
Can you let Ryan know, please?
Cheers, mate.
Listen, I told you
no more of your shit here.
It's only gonna be for a few hours,
mate. What's the problem?
How the fuck have you got in anyway?
Fucking hell.
Fuck's sake.
Hey, did you give
those two pricks a key?
- What?
- Those two jokers who just walked out.
- Did you give them a key?
- What you on about?
What have I told you about
giving the key to people?
- You hear me?
- Yeah.
- Who are you?
- Oh, I just live here, love.
Oh, are you Ryan's stepdad?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
I want that shit downstairs
moving as soon as possible.
And I won't tell you again, right?
Right.
No need to shout.
Jess?
For God's sake, Jess. It's nearly
two o'clock, for Christ's sakes.
Get up for school. You're late.
- It's the middle of the afternoon.
- So what, man?
Will you get up for school?
Oh, just leave me alone.
I'm trying to sleep.
Will you get up, Jess?
Obviously, I'm not going to
school if I'm in bed, am I?
God, leave me alone.
Right, well, I'll just
clear up for you, shall I?
- Eh? I'll just...
- Oi, knobhead.
Who the fucking hell are you?
Look, Jess, will you sort this out?
It's not a bleeding doss-house.
- Trying to get me head down.
- I'm just sick of it, I am.
- What the...
- Who the fuck are you, you prick?
- Pardon me?
- Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck am I?
I'll tell you who the fuck I am.
I'm fucking room service!
Do you wish to register
a fucking complaint?
Look at my room, man!
Look, just go away. Move!
Fuck off. I'm trying to sleep.
Piss off, man.
Look at my room.
Look at my room!
Fucking sick of it!
Fucking get it sorted.
- I'm up to here with it!
- What the hell?
Hello. We're not available now.
Please leave your name
and phone number after the beep.
We will return your call.
Dad, it's me again.
Where the hell are ya?
Will you phone me, please?
God, is your mobile working or what?
D'you know I'm missing two classes now?
I've gotta rush back
and pick up Daisy myself.
You've really let me down, Dad.
I am so pissed off.
Will you just ring me
and let me know that you're okay?
Have you ever had a shrink, Eric?
You know what he asked me?
When's the last time you was happy?
Today, at Old Trafford,
it's the return of Eric Cantona,
the most talented, temperamental
and talked about footballer in Britain.
Cantona takes control.
Makes good ground.
Looking for the shooting opportunity
and finds it!
Eric Cantona again
for Manchester United.
Crosses it towards Cantona.
Kanchelskis. It's a great ball.
Cantona takes it in his stride
and fires Manchester United
into the lead.
Drink a drink a drink
To the king, the king, the king
For he's the leader
of our football team
He's the greatest centre forward
That the world has ever seen
Cantona. It's still Cantona.
There's one back.
Cantona for Manchester United.
Oh, but he's won it back.
Giggs. Here's Cantona.
Yes! Eric Cantona with the goal
for Manchester United.
Look at the state of him.
He's got no rhythm. He's stuck. He's...
He's like a wonky wheel,
he can't get going.
I know, it's hard to believe, isn't it?
A few years ago
he was on the dance floor.
He was a brilliant dancer.
Look at the state of him.
I'm not being funny, but how long
is it since Chrissie bailed out?
Seven years.
And then he gets lumbered
with the two stepsons.
How's that work?
- Hello, boys.
- All right?
- What you got there?
- Shame, isn't it?
- Oh, don't worry, this'll sort him out.
- What is it?
Dog's bollocks this.
What is this?
- Take it from me.
- Now what you got?
You been raiding
the self-help section again?
You wanna be banned from bookshops.
If you can open up your tiny minds
for just a little minute,
you might learn something.
What Eric needs is laughter.
It's got it in there.
According to him,
laughter is the best medicine.
If you can make him laugh,
laughter, no matter whether
it's forced or artificial,
it makes you feel good.
Apparently it lifts your spirits,
it produces endorphins,
and all your body feels good.
If I was in Eric's shoes,
I'd rather have a good fuck,
I'll be honest with you.
- Is that you volunteering?
- No.
I'm volunteering Jack.
Listen, what we're gonna do
is try and make Eric laugh.
Okay. One at a time. All go down there.
Tell him a joke, do a dance, do what
you like, just make him fucking laugh.
Try and cheer the lad up, all right?
Do the best you can.
- All right, Eric?
- All right, Spleen?
Did you, did you hear
about the...
Oh, dear.
Need to do better
than that, Spleen.
- Hey, Eric. You all right?
- All right, Smug.
- Hey, two monkeys in a bath, right.
- Right.
One monkey turns to the other monkey
and goes...
- Like that, right? Right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The other monkey turns
to the other one and goes
"Put some cold water in, you daft cunt."
- Fucking hell.
- Oh, fuck off.
That's not bad. It's better than
Spleen's anyway, weren't it?
Yeah, whatever.
- Hi, Eric.
- All right.
Hey, you're good at
crosswords, aren't you?
- Yeah, yeah, aye.
- Yeah.
Heavily laden postman.
- How many letters?
- A fucking big bagful.
Yeah, yeah.
Stand in front of your imaginary mirror.
Yeah.
Stand in front of your imaginary mirror.
Think of someone who loves you
and imagine viewing yourself
through their eyes.
Yeah?
Don't fuck about. Come on.
It's easy this, isn't it?
Have you had to have met them?
Do you have to have met the person?
Well, you...
You must have met them if they love you.
- Come on.
- Is there any way we can prep
- to get into it?
- You can fucking shut up for a start!
I'm here.
I'm in front of me mirror.
Stand in front of a fucking
imaginary mirror. Right?
- I am.
- Think of someone who...
This might be hard for you.
Think of someone who loves you.
And imagine viewing yourself
through their eyes.
- It's fucking dead easy.
- Smug loves him.
No, come on, do it now.
- No, come on.
- It's all right.
Then gently press
the thumb of each hand
against the biggest finger...
- Of your own hand or someone else's?
- Not like that, is it?
No, your hand.
- The same hand?
- It's like that.
Have to sit down for this bit.
Keep at it, keep at it,
keep at it. Right.
Now, with your eyes closed,
breathe in slowly.
What's best? In through the nose
and out through the mouth
or in through the mouth
and out through the nose?
Just breathe.
Breathe through
your arse if you like. Just breathe.
I get dizzy if I breathe too much.
Shut up. Keep your eyes closed,
breathe slowly and relax.
Allow yourself to see yourself
through the eyes of
someone who loves you,
totally loves you.
Someone who loves you
without any condition, right?
You are totally loved.
And you're breathing.
And you're holding your
finger and your thumb.
- Are we there?
- Yeah.
We're all there?
- Is this supposed to relax us?
- Yes.
This better not be some kind of
weirdo cult thing.
Oh, can't you shut up for a minute?
Weirdo cult thing?
- I'm not taking me pants off.
- Shut up!
Fucking concentrate! Will you?
Just calm down, just fucking...
Well, it's him! You fucking...
Like Derek Acorah.
I'm trying to talk
to the unconscious mind,
not the fucking brain-dead.
Right. You're breathing, your fingers,
your thumbs together.
There's someone who likes you, you're
looking through their eyes at yourself.
Now I've took you over to
the Possibility Generator.
Now I want you to think of
someone who you like,
someone whose confidence and charisma
you wish to emulate. Right?
Okay.
Have you got
that person in your mind?
- Yes.
- Someone you think the world of.
Charisma, confidence
and you want to emulate them.
- But you don't have to know these ones?
- Oh, shut up.
I'm just checking.
- Smug, who have you thought of?
- Sammy Davis.
- Sammy Davis, Jr.
- 'Cause, like, for his confidence.
Smug is looking through
the eyes of Sammy Davis, Jr.
Well, he's looking through one of them.
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Spleen?
Fidel Castro.
Okay. Fidel Castro.
Jack?
- Nelson Mandela.
- Good choice.
Nice one. Nelson Mandela.
Travis?
Gandhi.
- Good one.
- Nice one. Eric?
Eric Cantona. King Eric.
- Of course.
- Best footballer ever lived.
- Good man. Good man.
- Good call, good call.
- I'll tell you what
- What about you, Meatballs?
Me?
Old Blue Eyes.
Mr Frank Sinatra.
I'm gonna emulate Frank Sinatra.
Hey, we could do a duet.
Right, what a room we've got here.
What a fantastic room. Sammy Davis, Jr,
Fidel Castro, Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,
Eric Cantona
and Old Blue Eyes himself,
Mr Frank Sinatra.
Eh? What a year that was.
You got hold of Winnie, now?
I need to see Winnie.
Winnie.
Here you are, come on,
finish off over here, Meatballs.
- Eric, what's this, mate?
- Fucking, my letters. Do you mind?
Have you not opened them?
Are they yours, Eric?
What is he looking at me letters for?
Can you put them down, please?
Come and sit down.
Let's carry on with this exercise.
Jack, what are you doing,
for fuck's sake?
Are they yours? Have you not
opened them? They might be bills.
Oh, for crying out bleeding loud.
- Eric.
- What's this, Eric?
Eric, what's going on, mate?
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- Fucking hell, man.
Spleen, get on the phone
and tell the lads.
We're gonna have to
deliver these tomorrow.
Flawed genius, eh?
Flawed postman.
How's your self care, Eric?
Have you ever thought about
killing yourself?
Who loves you, Eric?
Takes care of you?
You know what knocked me for six?
And I didn't fucking see this coming.
"Have you ever done anything
that you're ashamed of?"
Well, have you?
Fucking hell.
What the fuck?
- Is that really you?
- Yeah.
Say something in French then.
Fucking hell, it is you.
What the fuck, man?
Wait till the fucking lads
hear about this.
They still fucking love ya.
It's Lily, n'est-ce pas?
I can't say her name.
I don't like to talk about her, Eric.
Say it.
I can't.
You have to face this. Right?
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Lily. Fuck.
It's always fucking Lily.
- Open the trunk.
- No, I can't.
- You what?
- Without danger,
we cannot get beyond danger.
Come on.
God.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
God.
Here y'are, look at that.
"Manchester duo
win '50s dance competition."
19th of July, 1979.
Thirty years ago.
Used to love dancing. Rock 'n' roll.
You know, putting all the gear on
and doing the hair.
That's a picture from the night
we won the contest.
- A great night.
- Ah, yes.
What a pair of blue suede shoes.
Yeah, blue suede shoes.
Hey, they got sent from America.
Cost me a week's wages they did.
I wonder what happened to them.
You know,
sometimes the beautiful memories...
...are the most toughest of them all.
C'est la vie.
Yeah.
They're the hardest to deal with.
C'est la vie.
Yeah.
It was a daft idea, really.
The compere, he pulled out these
tickets at random from these boxes,
one for the girls and one for the boys.
And you met for the first time
on the dance floor.
Anyway, he goes "Number 19.
Eric, where are ya?"
... Eric Bishop.
I got up on the dance floor,
like, bit nervous.
"And for the ladies,"
Number one. Lily Devine.
Then I turned round, like,
she just sort of floated out,
absolutely fucking gorgeous.
She looked a little bit shy, like.
But you could sense
there was a bit of mischief in there.
What a dancer. I couldn't believe it.
She left me standing.
I was like, "Oh, what's going on here?"
But the second one, second number was,
It's Late by Ricky Nelson.
I was ready for her then.
And the band start playing.
And I'll tell you what,
I was chucking her about and flipping
her and tossing her everywhere.
She just kept coming back
faster than ever.
It was like she fucking trusted me,
you know what I mean?
I don't know.
I don't know if it was, like,
the dancing or whatever
that just brought us closer together,
but...
It was just like
one of those magic nights
that you know
you're never gonna have again.
Sometimes we didn't do anything,
we just sat there
and just held each other's eyes.
I've never done that with anyone else,
except Lily Devine.
And 30 years later, you can't even
face her. Incroyable, non?
Well, a lot of mistakes have been made.
A lot of water under the bridge.
Can you imagine being asked
by your daughter
to meet your ex-wife on a daily basis,
when you've hardly seen her
for three decades?
Well, I'm just a few weeks
off graduation and I'm...
I'm struggling. I am way behind
with my dissertation. And if...
- lf I don't finish it, I can't graduate.
- Right.
And it's been difficult with Daisy.
So I was just wondering, when you
pick her up from nursery,
instead of bringing her back to mine
at 5:00, like you normally do,
can you keep her
for just one more hour till 6:00?
Yeah, course I can.
No problem, Daisy, eh?
Brilliant. That means I can study
in the library till 10:00.
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- Ah, what's that?
- You're no problem to your granddad.
- Here you are, Dad.
- Are you, eh?
- Come here, chicken. Ah, chicken.
- Hello. What's the matter? Eh?
- Let's get your bottle for ya.
Oh, come here.
- Hey, look at that.
- Are you hungry?
- Look at the sunshine, eh.
- Oh, cheers, Dad.
- She ready for this?
- Here you go.
So where do you want us
to drop her then?
- At Mum's.
- Oh, for God's sake, Sam.
I've hardly seen your mother for years.
Most of your life, for Christ's sake.
- Don't ask me to do that, love.
- Dad.
- I can't, not now, it's just...
- You've both moved on.
It doesn't make sense any more.
- I spoke to Mam and she don't mind.
- Well, what did she say?
Well, it's practical,
by far the easiest.
What did she say?
She said it might be good
to see you again, catch up.
Just tell me exactly what she said, Sam.
She said it doesn't
really matter anymore.
Well, you asked, Dad.
Five words.
"It doesn't really matter anymore."
That's what she said.
Now that is worse than hatred.
Oui. Much worse.
Oh, well, thanks a lot.
And then when I saw her...
She'd really taken care of herself.
Her hair, the way she stood, everything.
Fuck.
Brought it all back?
You, Lily and baby Sam?
Oh, God, yeah.
Like it was yesterday. Nearly 30 years.
I'm fucked.
Oui.
Right with you, mon ami.
So I suggest a jump
off the nearest block of flats.
Oh, it's all right for you.
Flawed genius bastard.
Playing beach football.
VIP. Celebrity pals.
You've even got a fucking French accent.
Eh, look at me. Scrawny little fuck.
You've got it all, mate. All of it.
You think my friends
are better than yours?
It's all just slipping
through me fingers.
The lads look through me.
And I can't even trust meself.
I feel like... I feel like I'm floating
and I'm looking down on meself,
wandering round
like a scabby old fucking dog.
What? What?
He that forecasts all perils
will never sail the seas.
He that is afraid to shake the dice
will never throw a six.
If you do not enter a tiger's den,
you cannot get his cubs.
Oh, stick your proverbs
up your fucking arse.
How do you say that in French?
- Huh?
- That's not very nice.
I'm fucking up to here
with your philosophy.
I'm still getting over the fucking
seagulls one, for Christ's sakes.
Always got more choices than we think.
Always.
Yeah, like what?
A shave.
Oh, I can't face her. Right?
Yes, you can.
Right?
- Eric.
- Chrissie.
No. Lily. Your first wife.
Yeah. Sorry, just a bit nervous.
She fed about half-hour ago.
There's fruit purée
in the Tupperware.
- The nappies are underneath.
- Amazing.
Oh, and the bibs are underneath.
And there's a bottle of water
in case she needs it.
Fantastic.
- Are you okay, Eric?
- Yeah, fine. Fine.
I'm sorry about the other day.
It's just that
I had a bit of a dizzy spell.
Hadn't slept right.
But, yeah, I'm fine, fine.
- Fighting fit.
- Good.
So are you okay for dropping her
at my place later
- or would you rather meet back here?
- Whatever's easiest.
It's only six weeks, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I...
- Yeah.
- I didn't mean it like that. I just...
- Fancy a cup of tea, Lily?
- Why?
Look, Eric, let's just try and get
through this the best we can for Sam.
- Yeah.
- I'll see you later, Eric.
- Okay. See you.
- Bye-bye, gorgeous.
Hello.
Ryan, can I have a word, please?
- It's one of them.
- Ryan, what the fuck is that out there?
Just a rough guess,
but it looks like a cement mixer.
Yeah, I can see
it's a cement mixer, Ryan.
- What the fuck is it doing there?
- It's just chilling there for a bit.
What else do you think it is,
a fucking go-kart?
- Just having a Bud.
- You've nicked it, haven't ya? Eh?
- Who's nicked it?
- I haven't nicked it.
- You've nicked it.
- I haven't nicked it.
Where's it come from? You've nicked it.
Right, well, I'll get it sorted.
Just chill out.
Yeah, well, get it
shifted now, please, will ya?
- Look, I'll do it when I can.
- Eh?
Here you are.
Hang on a minute.
Where you going?
- Going to the match.
- Yeah. Coming, Eric?
- You got everything?
- Where you going? The match?
Man U versus Barcelona.
Watch the shopping, will you?
Eric, next time I'll try
and get you a ticket.
Zac's a main player.
He's got probably one of
the best boxes in the stadium.
- Come on, lad, stop fucking about.
- Champagne, the works.
- You'd love it.
- Oi, come on. We've gotta go. Come on.
Where are you
going with that? Get rid of it.
What the fuck?
Oh, fucking hell!
Oh, shit! Fucking work coat!
Bastard! Oh, for fuck's sake!
Fucking hell! Fuck, fuck, fucking hell!
Jack Bishop. Ironmonger.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Your father.
Were you close?
Well, he sat on me by mistake once.
She sent me this
a week after I left her.
"I can't love you any more than this.
"Lily."
I never ever answered her.
And the longer I left it,
the worse it was.
And then there was just no going back.
So tell her the truth.
What can you say to someone
who's just laid
their heart out on a plate?
It's just like there.
Let's have a look at that.
You know what, fuck it. Fuck it.
There's just no way
I'm gonna get through this.
I can't meet her every day.
I'll just end up back at that
fucking roundabout going round.
You must speak to her.
- I can't.
- You can't. So write to her.
I haven't got any words. And...
Fuck.
- Eric?
- Oh, no.
- Eric!
- No.
Come on, we're going for a pint.
Come on.
Go on, Eric. You are a lucky man.
- Come on!
- Go.
- Come on, mate...
- Come on, Eric, shake yourself.
All right, all right. I'm coming!
Stop banging! I'm on me way down now!
Fucking hell.
- Don't forget your wallet.
- All right.
Hey up, hey up. What's the shirt, mate?
FC United, mate. People's club.
- Wouldn't wipe my arse on that, pal.
- Oh, yeah?
Sit down, Spleen.
You're gonna have a heart attack,
- for God's sake.
- Fucking give us that pint.
Listen, pal.
You run off and left us.
They left me.
Who left you? United?
The most famous team in history.
We got over 300 million fans.
- And we left you?
- Yes.
I told you this before, right?
A bloke once said,
"Leave your...
You can change your wife,
"change your politics,
change your religion.
"But never, never can you change
your favourite football team."
Yeah, all right, we may be small.
We may be small. But you know what?
There's no fat bastard chairman can
sell us out for 30 pieces of silver.
No, 'cause
the fat bastard's sat there.
Our club.
And I'll tell you what, that's what
they said about United.
- 1878, weren't it, eh?
- Yes.
Newton Heath they were called.
Lowly railway men. Eh? What about that?
You're pissing on your own history,
you know that?
No, it's still there. Still there.
It's all in the heart. It's still there.
- We'll never die, pal, us.
- Yeah.
He never fucking goes, Judge, anyway.
What you talking about?
Yeah, but I've told him,
there's no secret in the fact.
I can't afford it.
I can't afford to take the kids.
Exactly.
That's the point, innit, you daft git.
Car parks don't lie!
- They don't.
- You have a look. Have a look now.
What kind of car
parks in there on a match day?
Not the kind of cars we can afford.
How many postmen you know
- go to the game?
- Yeah. We're going on bikes
with fucking baskets on the front.
Won't pay Glazer
Or work for Sky
Still sing "City's gonna die"
Two Uniteds but the soul is one
As the Busby Babes carry on
- Carry on
- Oh, matron.
- Hypocrites, you are.
- You what?
Walking adverts. Look at you.
Just sponsors' names on your chests.
We don't have sponsors on our chest.
We're like Barcelona.
- What?
- Spanish.
- Who would sponsor you?
- You're sat there on a Tuesday night.
Tuesday night.
You're the fuckers
who put 50, 60 million quid
in Edwards' pocket.
- Yeah.
- Filling Murdoch's fucking pockets.
What the fuck are you doing here?
You fucking don't know
what you're doing.
- You make me sick.
- Sit down and shut the fuck up.
- I'm going. I'm going!
- Fuck off!
The game's just starting,
you fucking knob.
- Come on, Meatballs.
- Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio.
Where are you going, to walk your dog?
- Fucking brilliant, innit?
- Different class, that.
Hey, here are, here are, here are.
Let's get him at it here. Here are.
Goal!
Who scored? Who scored? Who scored?
Fucking twats.
How many times I told you
about fucking about with shit?
- I'm not fucking about.
- We're fucking trying to
do some serious work.
You're not fucking about?
- You're not fucking about?
- No.
I'm not fucking about.
D'you hear me? I'm not fucking about.
Does this look like I'm fucking about?
- No.
- No?
Get that shit out your fucking garden.
Don't look at me.
Just get in the fucking house,
you little prick.
You all right?
Remember we used to be able to
talk about anything?
Bit late for that now.
What does he want from ya?
- Who?
- Your mate in the car.
Nothing.
Good. Good to me.
Yeah. So good he gives you a smack, eh?
Is that what friends do these days?
You don't even know him. It's sorted.
Yeah. I used to have a laugh
with my friends.
I have a laugh with them.
Look, Ryan, I wanna help, mate.
You can't go on like this.
What are you gonna do, Eric?
- Brownie, mate... Yeah...
- Is it?
Right, come on, lads.
It's getting late now.
I think it's time
your mates went home, Jess.
I think it is, you know.
- Who is this, then?
- Jess, come on,
I've got work tomorrow
and you've got school.
Let's wrap it up, eh.
Five more minutes and that's it, yeah?
Five more minutes, I mean it.
Fucking hell.
You must say no.
No.
Come on, say it.
No.
In French.
Non.
Non.
Like you mean it. Non!
- Non.
- More, more, more. Non!
Non!
- Non!
- Non!
From your balls. Non!
- Non! Non! Non!
- Non! Non! Non!
- Non! Non!
- Non!
- Non! Non! Non! Non!
- Non! Non! Non!
Non! Non! Non!
Non! Non! Non! Non!
Non! Non! Non! Non! Non!
Dad? Are you all right?
Non.
Remember Nottingham Forest?
No.
Oh, come on.
Giggs takes the corner.
He bangs it over. You're there waiting.
- Bang, in it goes.
- No, no.
Oh, Man City.
Hughes down the right
wing to Kanchelskis.
Kanchelskis chips it over.
You're there waiting.
Bang, casual as you like. Straight in.
No.
Arsenal. Beckham crosses it over.
Their defender comes out, heads it away.
You see it coming.
Take a step and half back
to accommodate the bounce.
Bang, on the half volley. Straight in.
Seaman didn't know what hit him.
- Come on.
- Not that one.
Oh, God, give me strength.
- Morning, Eric.
- Morning, love.
- Are the lifts working?
- No. Knackered again, I'm afraid.
Third time this week.
Must have been amazing though.
Sixty thousand people watching ya.
Cheering. Chanting your name.
- Scary, yeah.
- You, scared?
- Yeah.
- Never.
Scared it might stop.
I loved to surprise the crowd, you know?
Every time, in every game,
I tried to offer them a gift.
Sometimes it didn't work,
but then when it did...
- In our minds forever.
- Yeah.
But I had to surprise myself first.
Take a risk.
You know, it depends on the limits
you set yourself.
Play safe, no risk.
You know?
Remember Sunderland?
Ah, that was a beauty. Magnifique.
It was like a ballet. A dance.
Kept me going for months that goal.
... squeezed past a
couple of defenders. McClair.
Here's Cantona. He's done it.
That is magnificent by Cantona.
It just sort of fills you up so
much that you just
forget the rest of the shit in your life
just for a few hours.
I miss the games, me.
Only place where you can go
where you can let rip
without getting arrested.
Shout, scream, laugh.
- Yeah. Even cry.
- Yeah.
And see Englishmen kiss.
I mean, where else can you sing at the
top of your voice with all your mates?
That's what I really miss.
It's gotta be a good 10 years now
since I last went to a game.
All right. Sweetest moment ever?
It wasn't a goal.
- It's gotta be a goal, Eric.
- No.
Come on. Last minute.
FA Cup Final against Liverpool.
Beckham takes a corner.
The goalie runs out.
He punches it away. It hits your chest.
Hits the floor on its way up.
Bang, you just whack it
right in the net.
No.
Wimbledon. It's gotta be Wimbledon.
You're going towards the ball.
The ball's coming in.
You're sussing out the trajectory of it,
the angle of it.
The spin on it.
The way the wind's blowing.
The speed of the wind. Everything.
You stick your right foot out.
You stop it in mid-flight.
It bounces up about a foot off your leg.
You come back, you whack it in.
The most perfect volley in the world.
In it goes. It's a goal.
It's gotta be a goal, Eric.
It was a pass.
- A pass?
- Yeah.
My God. To Irwin against Spurs. Yes!
Beautiful.
I know how clever he was.
Left, right-footed.
Came in a flash. I just flicked it
with the outside of my boot.
Surprised everyone.
He took it in his stride
and my heart soared.
A gift.
Yeah, like an offering
to the Great God of Football.
What if he'd have missed?
You have to trust your teammates.
Always.
If not, we are lost.
It must have been tough on you
when you got banned.
Nine months? The bastards.
That twat got what he deserved.
I had to work hard, you know?
Dig deep inside.
I needed something to fill me up
when I was on my own.
Something to aim for, you know?
It's funny, innit?
Sometimes we forget that
you're just a man.
I'm not a man.
I am Cantona.
So what did you do
to keep yourself going?
I learn the trumpet.
- A trumpet?
- Yeah.
- You're taking the piss now, Eric.
- No. True.
Listen.
What?
Hi, Eric. I'm sorry about this.
I'm sorry to just call on you like this,
but your mobile's switched off.
Me mum's had a bit of a fall
and I'm gonna have to whip her
up to A and E.
Can you take Daisy for a couple of
hours? Just for a couple of hours
- while I get her up there.
- Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
- Can you grab the pram? Can I come in?
- Yeah, sorry, yeah.
- Come in, come in. I wasn't thinking.
- Cheers.
I'm just making tea.
Come straight through to the kitchen.
I've not tidied up in there yet, Lily.
Just come straight through.
So, butler on holiday, Eric?
Or have you sacked him?
Well, you know how it is
with two teenage lads.
- Oh, my God.
- I'll make a start on it anyway.
Hey, hello, baby. Hello.
Sam's gonna have to find somebody else.
- Lily.
- Sorry. Sorry.
Lily, don't run off like this. Lily.
Lily, wait.
Jess? Jess!
- What, man?
- Come here.
- Where's your bike?
- It's in the backyard.
Right, listen. Look after Daisy
for me for a while, right?
- What do you mean?
- Just look after her.
- Dad, I can't look after a baby.
- Yeah, well, learn.
Dad, I don't know how to. What do I do?
She's crying, Dad. Dad!
How's your mum?
My brother took her to hospital.
She's fine.
- She's just badly bruised.
- Look...
I just thought I...
I thought I'd better explain, really.
- Explain?
- Yeah.
Explain?
I was just 21, Eric.
I had your baby.
I loved you to absolute pieces.
You walked out on me.
Never come back.
And you left me to
raise a child on my own.
Do you want me to explain
how I cried myself to sleep every night?
How I fell apart.
And I had to rebuild my life.
Just go, Eric Bishop.
Because I don't care.
She hates you. Right?
Now we are going somewhere.
Well, we're going nowhere.
I mean, she's right,
I've totally flipped.
We're both fucking grandparents.
What?
Look, I'm getting a bit fed up
with all this bullshit, right.
- Okay. I don't translate.
- Oh, that's fine with me.
Oh, fuck it. What does it mean?
- Oh, come on, tell us.
- No.
Oh, look. You can't just say it
and then just forget about it like that.
I will not be a burden.
Oh, you're not a burden, mate,
you know that.
You're welcome here any time.
There's no way you're a burden.
Just tell us what it means.
The noblest vengeance is to forgive.
She might forgive me?
Shit. It's Lily.
"Meet me in the pub.
You know which one. Now."
Fucking hell.
I told you.
Hi, Lily. Would you like a drink?
- I'll just have half a cider, please.
- Okay.
- Can I have, half a cider, please?
- Yeah, sure.
There you go.
Seems like yesterday.
I know. It's hardly changed, has it?
But we have.
I'm really scared about opening
all this up, you know, Lily.
Just tell me, Eric.
I need to hear this.
- Just tell me.
- Okay.
The first time it happened was at
Sam's christening party. Remember?
At first I thought it was
just too hot, too smoky.
You know, too many people
in the same room.
All that hand-shaking and back-slapping.
"What's your plans now, son?"
"Different ball game now, son."
On and on and on they went,
again and again.
Then the old man come over.
No back-slapping from him.
Just them hard little eyes
and that clipped tongue of his.
And I saw you in the corner with Sam,
you were feeding her.
I remember 'cause you blew me a kiss.
But for some reason, that made him mad.
And he sort of grabs me on
the back of the neck
like he used to do when I was a kid.
Shoving me backwards and forwards like
a fucking game show
host with a contestant.
"Fucking kisses?
Let's see how long that lasts.
"You had the brains to go to college.
"Now we'll see what you're made of.
"You've made your bed now, son,
you can lie on it. "
Felt like me head was in a
plastic bag or something.
Then he started prodding me with that
stubby little fucking finger of his.
I felt like...
I felt like I was floating off.
It was like I was
coming out of me own body.
I was up there stuck on the
fucking ceiling looking down at meself.
Eric Bishop with Jack Bishop,
ironmonger, prodding me in slow motion.
Hey, where you going?
It was a panic attack, Eric.
They're more common than you think.
I mean, we come across it more or less
all the time at the clinic.
I didn't know what it was.
About half an hour later,
when I'd calmed down, I came back.
I came in and I just put an act on.
And you know what?
I've been doing that ever since.
Putting an act on.
But why couldn't you tell me?
I just blanked it out.
Even from meself.
I was terrified.
I thought I was going fucking bats
like me Uncle Michael.
Later on, I'd see you feeding Sam.
And I don't know, I can't explain it,
but I just couldn't handle it.
I just couldn't handle it.
It freaked me out.
And then it got to the problem
where I was scared of going home.
Scared of going back to me own gaff.
I just thought you'd gone cold.
- No.
- Regretted the baby.
No way.
I just wanted you to touch me, Eric.
I felt fat, ugly.
My clothes always stinking of milk.
No.
And I remember I had
a right go at you, didn't I?
Oh, God, yeah.
I didn't know I could scream like that.
Neither did I.
Mind you, I don't blame ya.
Staying out, getting drunk.
Off with the lads all the time.
Excuses.
All the lies you told.
I know. It's not so much
the fact that I left you,
which I did, I hold me hands up.
I just couldn't get back.
I just couldn't get back.
Are you all right, Daisy? Yes, you are.
