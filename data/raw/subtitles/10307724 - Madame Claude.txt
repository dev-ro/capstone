♪ Treat me this way... ♪
Whilst I'm unwinding here,
elsewhere in Paris, my girls are working.
Business is flourishing.
I take a 30% cut.
My rate is 500 francs for two hours.
It quickly adds up.
If I manage my affairs well,
I will be comfortable
until the end of my days.
♪ I try to stay away from her ♪
I realized very early on
that most men treat us like whores.
I decided to be the queen of whores.
That our bodies must be used
like a weapon and armor.
To never suffer again.
Bonjour. What a pleasure.
- Bonjour.
- Hello, madame.
♪ She's a queen, she's a queen ♪
♪ I never thought
She could do this to me ♪
♪ She could never hurt me this way ♪
Thank you.
♪ Ah, but even if she appeared ♪
♪ I ♪
♪ I could never, ever tell her
To go away ♪
So, my name is Sidonie.
I grew up in Lyon.
Went to private school.
Had a nanny.
I like girls,
and also boys of my age.
The high life, luxury, and a challenge.
Very well.
You'll need to be kept in line, I see.
- Good luck.
- Pardon?
Kept in line, you say.
That I'd love.
All right. Show me.
Mm-hmm.
Take your top off.
I'd wanted to be somebody.
I started by choosing my own name.
A name that matched my ambition.
And I have plenty of ambition.
Hello, oui, Claude speaking.
Just a minute, please.
You have a trial placement now.
Go enjoy the party, I'll come find you.

Well?
Well, um...
Yeah, not bad.
Not bad.
A tornado.
- Tell me.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, exceptional.
Uh, intelligent, classy, cultured.
Better not send her
to men who like to be in charge,
- but in my opinion, she's very...
- The one on Tuesday, Geneviève?
Mmm, not bad.
Conversation?
Pleasant.
- Certainly an appetite.
- For sex?
Mm-mmm.
At the dining table.
She wasn't forcing it.
Mmm.
Her thighs are a bit heavy, no?
- My strong point: discretion.
- Fine by me.
Some even question my existence.
See you later.
Others think I'm a man.
I would like to have been a man.
...Jacques Chabeau
and the mystery surrounding
the assassination of Stefan Marković,
the former Yugoslav secretary,
and Alain Delon's bodyguard.
The mystery's given the detectives
of the First Brigade...
It has to be said.
I had a rough start.
I was born in the wrong place.
At 17, I found love.
Or rather, a fleeting encounter.
Pregnant. A disaster.
It was over.
That wasn't the life I wanted.
I left my daughter with my mother,
and I went to Paris.
You look beautiful.
Do you like it?
I'll give it to you when you're older.
Cupboards. Lots of storage.
You'll be happy here.
And the bathroom.
Lovely marble.
- Do you like it? It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Well, uh...
I've always lived in the country.
It'll be strange for me.
Just like I promise.
- Don't pull that face.
- No, I'm... I'm pleased.
At least for our young lady.
- Mmm, yes.
- Okay.
Here you go, darling.
This is for you.
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay.
Do you like it? Are you pleased?
Hello, oui, Claude speaking.
Who is it you want to speak with?
Charles? Oh, yes, he's a friend of mine.
Yeah.
Yes, of course.
Mm-hmm.
Oh. Well, my girls are always docile.
Tuesday next week. That's perfect.
It's a pleasure.
- What did you say your name was?
- Clarence.
Right. From now on, it's Virginie.
Clarence is no longer suitable.
- Can I dress, if I may?
- Not just yet.
Very important: hygiene.
Show me how you wash yourself.
Follow me.
Go on. Pick up the flannel.
No, no, not like that.
Didn't your mother teach you?
- Well...
- No. Firstly, use the bidet.
The bidet isn't a dog bath.
Hang on. Give it to me.
Give me that.
There. There you are.
See? It's not rocket science.
And the back.
Very good.
Oh. You're already here.
You're early. I need a couple of minutes.
Well, there's a lot to do,
but we'll get there.
You look beautiful.
- That wasn't all that bad, eh? Off you go.
- No.
Au revoir.
Tell me what happened.
Did the client complain?
- Never say "client." Say "friend."
- Pardon. Friend.
He was extremely happy. Dithyrambic.
I'm individual.
Tell me, Sidonie.
Perhaps why you, though?
I have 200 exceptional girls
who work for me. They're prettier, too.
Because I'm loyal.
I already have enough contacts.
But above all, I'm the same as them.
You don't need to educate me,
teach me their ways. I know them.
That saves time.
Your idea was ingenious.
Pray on the wealthy ones.
Break into the higher echelons
with girls like them.
Seize the power and fuck them
from the inside-out.
Sounds perfect,
fucking them from the inside-out.
And my mother taught me
personal hygiene. Don't worry.
She didn't teach you how to knock.
Right. I have a busy day. Come on.
We'll walk and talk.
If you turned it down a notch,
we could do great things together.
- Do you fancy wine to celebrate?
- I don't drink.
You work too hard.
You need to get out more.
- Why do you think I don't?
- Because I'm out all the time.
Castel, right? I can't bear it there.
Why not take me somewhere
that you can bear?
Paris wasn't what I imagined.
Soon as I arrived, I made friends
and found myself on the street corner.
Hey! Hey!
Stop. Come here!
You like hitting girls, huh?
Bonsoir, how are you?
Are you all right? You look like shit.
How are you, my dear Nicole?
I'd like to introduce Sidonie.
I'll be back in five minutes.
Three justices of the peace.
They settle any conflict
within our circle.
The Panzani brothers
from the Lutetia bar,
a real institution
when it comes to extortion,
sat next to Marcantoni,
a Corsican who runs things
from Les Trois Canards bar.
And Jo Attia.
It's impossible at the moment.
Some blokes.
They're wops, I reckon. Three of them.
Threats and all that bollocks.
You see Filou's mug?
Now they're even coming for me and all.
That's real hunger.
They're backed against a wall. No respect.
I propose
the dirty work's left to the cops.
I have a contact who owes me.
- What do you mean?
- We don't get our hands dirty.
Cops? Is that where it's at?
For the time being,
keep our heads down.
What about that loser Marković?
What's his story And these photos?
I thought he was a friend of yours,
but he's a nuisance.
You've been a little misinformed again.
One of your girls was in that photo.
She hasn't worked for me
for some time now,
- so it's you who's been misinformed.
- Don't worry, Fernande.
Ask no questions,
I'll tell no lies.
That way, if I'm asked...
nothing to report.
- Champagne for Fernande.
- Allow me to introduce Sidonie.
Has Jo been a friend for a while?
In my world,
you need friends all the time.
As soon as you start earning cash,
you attract the jackals.
I'm exhausted.
Should we drop formalities?
With pleasure.
- Do you have a secret lover?
- I've no time.
Check out the man over there.
He's not bad, is he? You know him?
No.
But... probably a little bland.
I'll make introductions
if he keeps looking.
I've no time for romance.
Bonsoir.
Can I buy you a drink?
Yeah, I suppose.
Same again.
Enchante. André.
Care to dance?
Love is a disease.
You can't live with a disease.
When I was 25, I was in love,
and I wanted to die.
I took some pills...
and I didn't die.
I woke up.
I was cured.
Not bad.
Turn around.
- Not bad at all. Are you pleased?
- Mmm.
It's elegant.
So?
What a doll.
Exquisite. Jackie Kennedy.
- Really?
- More beautiful.
Anne.
- How about merci?
- Merci.
Is this how you thank me?
- When I was your age, I had nothing.
- I'm not sorry for you.
I'm taking you home.
You're not taking your bag?
No, I don't want to be like you.
I've never felt comfortable
in a cop shop, but that's the way it is.
They scratch my back, I scratch theirs.
The cops turn a blind eye
along with the tax man.
- I keep my eyes wide open.
- You're late.
Be quick.
I have a meeting that's important.
- A meeting that's important?
- Precisely.
What can I do for you?
Here are the details of two new friends.
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
Well, well, well.
Oh, you cheeky bastards.
It seems Mr. Operation Clean Hands
likes to get dirty.
The more powerful,
the more they give up in bed.
But doesn't that sound like
the pot calling the kettle black?
- It is a little.
- I'm here for something else.
There are idiots marauding Pigalle.
What? They've not been
to see me yet, but it won't be long.
Trust me, I'll take care of it. Promise.
Don't worry. So, do you have
any leads on the Marković affair?
There are rumors all over Paris
he's organizing parties,
taking photos,
and blackmailing the idiots.
Including some idiots
very, very high up in government.
Presumably, if there are orgies, you know.
- I do, but it's the first I've heard.
- Really?
Isn't your pal Marcantoni
a friend of Delon?
- Appears so. Hmm.
- Appears so? Mm-hmm.
Besides, I should be on my way.
- Okay. Ciao.
- Ciao, my beauty.
Daniel!
Daniel!
Sit down. Look at this.
It's not for kids.
Enjoys sodomy.
Likes to get pissed on.
"Urinated."
Bravo, Minister.
Excellent.
They're perfect.
That bodes well. I'm pleased.
Move.
Oh, your posture.
That's no good at all.
You're not doing justice
to your best feature: a nice ass.
That dress is good.
Claude speaking.
Where are you? You fucking idiot!
I don't believe it!
You went to the wrong client,
you imbecile?
How is that even possible? Tell me.
What do you mean, "Like Italian"?
An accent like Italian or Spanish?
What about any extras?
Fine. Well, don't forget to get paid.
Sidonie, it's Claude.
You can sleep another time.
That idiot Sophia
went to the wrong client.
Yes, the wrong client.
Just go to the Royal and save the day.
I won't tell your father.
Mm-hmm.
It's character-building.
Merci.
You were quick. That's important.
You were my savior.
"Here are questions
that determine
which member of the couple
should put in more effort."
Go on.
"Do you look forward
to your husband getting home?
Would you change just to please him?
Do you frequently tell him you love him?
Do you really feel that way?
Would you send your children to bed early
so you can have a conversation in peace?"
Do you imagine Claude likes it up the ass?
Well, I imagine whatever she's doing,
she gives orders. That's for sure.
Did she give a lesson in blowjobs?
Not me, no.
That's because you're special.
I mean, you're... you're a lady.
And plus, you're her favorite.
You don't need it.
Maybe she likes girls,
but doesn't admit it.
Hi.
I don't think so.
- Does she have friends?
- She's too harsh.
That's her.
Come on.
Clean up all this rubbish.
Marlon Brando will be here in 15 minutes.
Come on, come on, come on!
The coffees, the cups, the cigarettes.

In 10 years
I'd become bourgeois.
Respectable and respected all over Paris.
- I had money. A man.
- Clear this mess.
I had erased my poverty.
- Go on, go on. Come on. Come on.
- Erased Fernande.
Nothing could stop me.
Untouchable.
Hmm.
Your mom's at the door, yeah?
Tell her I've gone away.
- Sorry. She had to go away.
- Oh, she's not here?
I'll tell her a message.
Things can't carry on.
She can't take care of her daughter.
It's not easy for the child.
I don't want her to end up like her.
She's a whore.
Here are the keys.
Give them to her. She'll understand.
Au revoir, madame.
I guess you heard.
- Hello?
- Hello, Claude.
Ah, it's you.
We got your wops. It's all sorted.
Hey, can't forget
that information on Marković.
The pace is picking up.
Have you see the news yet?
No, not today.
You should.
See you later.
You're here?
It's not like you to be early.
I love the show.
The best show in all of Paris.
- André. Cigar?
- Ah, yes, please.
Merci.
Ciao. I'll be off, then.
I've got work to do.
I'm sure you'll have fun.
Enjoy, mes ami.
Fernande.
What's all this with Marković?
There are photos of Madame Pompidou,
naked, in action.
It's De Gaulle who's fucked up with it.
His former minister's involved.
He felt obliged to invite him to dinner.
To try to cover his behind.
Don't you worry about it.
It's not your affair.
I'm not worried.
But if you go down, we're all in this.
- There's no reason why that would happen.
- We'll deal with it. We'll speak.
This is all bad, but you know that.
They know nothing.
Come here, you.
I don't know what you know,
but you keep your mouth shut
with those new friends of yours,
the cops, people in power.
If you listen to me, it'll all be fine.
Not in my bar.
And not with Fernande.
Got it?
You never talk about you.
- Tell me a bit about yourself.
- Hmm.
It's not very interesting.
I don't talk. I just do.
You know you don't have to lie.
I'm on your side here.
I'd prefer it if you weren't.
Tomorrow is an early start.
Straightaway?
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Virginie.
Is it definitely at 22 Villa Hortensia?
Yeah, it's just...
I'm in a phone box over the road.
I rang the doorbell,
but there's no answer.
Well, ring it again. Don't be a silly cow.
Suzanne!
Suzanne, call Josie for me.
I broke a nail.
Yes, of course.
I wanted to tell you something, madame.
Um... I think I may be getting married.
Oh, yeah?
In fact,
Frédéric De Grimberg sent me a note,
And it said,
"Josie, I've organised you a...
Well I've organised us
a spectacular homecoming." You see?
He took me to his chateau.
And I met his cousins and everything.
Come back here!
And then,
he spoke to me about marriage.
Where is she?
- Would you be upset if I stopped?
- No, not at all. I'd be happy.
Here she is.
How do you like that? Yeah?
- Would you come?
- Of course.
Come here.
It's Virginie.
Oh my god. Come in.
What happened to you?
Did they do this to you?
That's enough. Speak.
Yes. They did.
They trapped me.
Chased me around the garden
like a little rabbit.
And you were paid?
- Two hundred thousand.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, there, there, there.
Calm down.
Don't work yourself into a state.
It's okay. It's going to be fine.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
There we are. Okay.
You're pale-skinned. You bruise easily.
This will be gone in a couple of days.
It's nothing serious.
Nothing to worry about.
Have a nice shower,
a good sleep, and that'll be the end.
There, there you are, my little rabbit.
Shh, shh, shh.
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.
Bad news. They've arrested Marcantoni.
Yeah. They analyzed the mattress cover
the body was found in,
and the fucking idiot
bought a whole load of shit.
They wanna extradite him.
I guess you're not surprised.
And basically, I wanted to warn you:
there'll be repercussions.
Merci, Georges.

I preferred Georges.
I can't stand this one. He's conceited.
I'm sure he's picked
a crappy code name, to annoy me.
- Bonsoir, Violette.
- Bonsoir, Serge.
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
- You see the street on the right?
- Mm-hmm.
Little way down, there's a bar.
You can't miss it. There's only one.
Pompidou had been elected.
I'd moved up a notch.
I resigned myself
to the intelligence services.
He'll have his eye on you.
Spot him as quickly as possible.
I won't guarantee safety
if your cover's blown before the bedroom.
Once you're in, he's ours.
- Is that clear?
- Yeah, sure, that's clear. That's fine.
I'll wait for him
to approach me first before we, ah...
Excellent. Good luck.
Superb choice.
I have a little something for you.
Merci.
Diplomat. He arrives tomorrow.
And what's more, there's a 20,000 bonus,
because we have a special request.
There's an issue with this one.
This man isn't already known to me.
He soon will be.
We need a girl we can trust,
because he's a bit... twisted.
Twisted?
Extremely twisted.
With this affair with Marković
constantly hanging about,
it's made everything a mess.
And then your friend...
Marcantoni...
He's no friend of mine.
You're now obliged
to the service of France.
Your fate is linked
to that of your country, Claude.
Being the madame
of the Republic was dangerous.
I'd become an institution, so I expanded.
As well as Marignan,
I rented a mansion on rue Boulainvilliers.
This way, we're all together,
like one big family.
Bonjour. How are you?
Enjoy yourselves.
- How are you?
- Very well. Merci.
Ah, darling.
So sweaty.
Animals sweat. Men perspire.
Women make do being too hot.
- That's a good education.
- Learned everything from the Visitandines.
- Pupil of the Visitandines?
- Who is this moron?
I'm provincial.
My father was the mayor of Angers.
I was educated by the Visitandines.
- I owe them everything.
- I started lying in school.
- Then the war...
- I made up a big house. Different parents.
When the Resistance...
It can't be easy, running all this alone.
You must have some support.
The bigger the lie,
the more believable.
Enough about me. I'm boring you.
From what I hear,
no one's ever bored with you, Claude.
Mmm, flattery won't get you far
with me, my dear.
It's not about flattery.
I just had to come see
my daughter's manager.
You've got it wrong.
No. Sidonie.
You see, I'm too old to be mistaken.
Believe me.
Me, as well.
Mm-hmm.
Here's Geneviève.
Is that all right?
Oh, yes. On the house.
I'll leave you to it.
Would you like to take a seat?
Yes. Merci.
Can I offer you something to drink?
Oh, I'll always have another whiskey.
Merci.
Come here. That guy over there.
If he causes trouble,
throw him out without a second thought.
In 1975, the Contemporary Arts
Centre will be built in Paris,
in working-class areas around City Hall
between Les Halles and Le Marais.
The metal and glass structure will be new...
The idea is to link the well-to-do areas
to the working-class districts.
The final design of the building
was a competition
involving 700 architects
all over the world,
the judges eventually agreeing upon
the design of an Italian company.
The project is
made up of an immense glass box
some 115 meters long and 46 meters wide.
Oh, yes, hello?
Are you asleep?
I left my glasses with you.
Were you asleep?
Yeah. I was asleep.
They would be difficult to put together.
Fucking hell.
- What? What is it?
- Ah, fuck.
- Get dressed.
- What does she want?
No idea, but she'll be here for sure.
This construction is
on such a grand scale
that just like in ancient times,
when cathedrals
seemed to appear from the ground itself,
this one...
Where is she?
Where is she?
What are you talking about?
About your cock that you shove everywhere!
You were fucking, weren't you?
Okay, very well.
You're just with me for the money.
You're a whore.
You should've told me sooner.
You're crazy.
I'm not one of your employees.
You are a whore!
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, you're a whore.
At least my girls
have the courage to admit they're paid.
So be honest. Be honest!
You're just with me for the money.
Claude, enough...
Don't touch me!
I understand
why your mother and daughter left.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Sweetheart...
please calm down.
Enough now.
Sit down.
Sit down, Claude.
I love you.
It's not what you think, my love.
I love you.
I really love you.
I love you.
Cold and sensual.
But of course.
That's booked, Thursday at 7:00 p.m.
Speak soon, Louis.
Au revoir.
I told you to answer the phone,
not take my place.
I'm reassured that you're not yet
dead enough to replace me.
Um, dead?
Yes. Dead inside.
You still love life too much.
Here. Kate's returned from Chad.
Have I done something I shouldn't have?
Claude?
It's André. He's a liar.
I'm going soft,
and that's not good.
I'm sure it's one of my girls.
And I'll find out which one.
Not me, you know. Too old for him.
Jo isn't too old though.
- Am I wrong?
- What are you talking about?
And also, your dad's in Paris.
- How do you know that?
- I met him yesterday.
He came to intimidate me in my own house.
Dirty asshole.
Deal with it. Sort your shit out.
Two minutes, if you please!
What's your dad's job?
Foreign affairs minister.
Well?
Claude, this is my friend Lola.
She wanted to be introduced.
Come back later.
There's a delicate job for you.
Delicate?
A diplomat. Your world.
You should put your ideas in place.
Sidonie, are you okay?
I'm coming.
Did you get told off by Claude?
Did you do something bad?
It's nothing to do with that.

ARMAND JAMMOT PRESENTS
THE SMALL SCREEN FILES
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you.
Get us something to eat. I'm famished.
Aye-aye, Captain.
UFOs. If you've forgotten...
- I'll get the usual.
- Mmm.
...unidentified flying object,
and more commonly known as flying saucers...
What happened?
After I closed,
an idiot just ran in and shot him dead.
Philou. At point-blank range.
Then he kidnapped Nicole.
He dragged her out by the hair.
She was screaming.
Made me fucking ill.
The cops found her four hours later.
Naked. In the forest of Saint-Germain.
Alive.
Thank god.
We'll cut his bollocks off.
Trust me, that guy is dead.
What are you doing here?
If there's anything I can do...
Mission was delicate.
Sidonie's very gifted.
She's my best earner.
A pussy prodigy.
If only you were aware.
I'm going to see Nicole.
Don't worry. You'll find him.
The bad guys
get their comeuppance in the end.
Every year,
I'd take my girls on holiday.
My favorites.
A kind of seminar.
It was good for bonding.
Virginie?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Well done.
The photos of the diplomat are perfect.
What talent.
My girls are highly talented.
By the way,
the nutter that caused havoc at Jo's.
He's in a cell.
He got arrested this morning.
I know that isn't what Joe wanted,
but cops got there first, apparently.
First Marcantoni, now Jo.
Just goes to show, no one's untouchable.
Enjoy yourself.
- What? Can't you swim?
- I can.
Isn't this lovely?
Mmm, it's paradise.
Yes. You're right.
And I've known hell.
When I was a girl,
no one was friends with me.
My best friend was a goat.
Much more reliable and intelligent
than most humans I knew.
I left them to each other,
to their foolishness.
Hmm.
Me, I just stayed with my goat.
I liked the way it smelled.
I appreciated her confiance.
The US Embassy insisted that the president
mustn't know it was one of our girls.
We had to introduce her as the daughter
or niece of the ambassador.
I said, "I've got a charming
English girl," and thought of Kate.
Well, Kennedy was a real gentleman.
Beautiful, charming, and polite.
Okay, don't get too excited.
You're just a look alike Jackie.
- He preferred you because you're sluttier.
- How dare you?
Nobody can tell you the truth.
No one speaks truth.
Alban, come on.
He's the most powerful man in the world.
- Anyway, he loved me.
- Yeah, right, he loved you.
- He loved me.
- Did he say, "I love you"?
But he definitely did
fall in love with you. He really did.
- It's true.
- So do you believe me now?
The one who pays best.
Know who's good, even if he is ugly?
But you know, that doesn't matter.
It's the shah of Iran.
A whole weekend of luxury and orgies.
On the boat during the day,
then the palace. It was neverending.
I'll spare you the details.
Well, I had Dali.
You should've seen her face.
Covered in sperm.
- Alban!
- What? It's the truth again!
- You said so yourself.
- I'm tired.
Claude, one more...
No, no, I wouldn't.
No.
Either she apologizes, or...
Don't be so annoying!
Stop it!
Everything is fine.
Even a bit too fine.
I'm so happy to be here with my family.
My real family.
Everything is bright.
The money takes care of that,
and we all make the most of it.
There you are. You disappeared.
I wasn't far away.
Merci.
I love you.
I know. I'm drunk,
and you're not mad about feelings,
but I love you so much.
Hmm.
Enjoy yourself?
Did you enjoy yourself?
Villa Hortensia.
They have some fun, don't they?
You like to have a good time,
don't you, Nadège?
Huh? Hmm.
Did you enjoy hostage? Was it fun?
Let me see that.
Well, you're not
too badly bruised, are you?
Got off quite lightly.
You're scheming.
You want more? Was that enough?
Was that enough, or do you want more?
Tell me, you dirty slut!
Don't worry.
Your sweetheart's on his way.
I called him in.
I love him, Claude.
- What did you say?
- We love each other, Claude.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
You're going to hit your mom, are you?
You're going to hit your mom?
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
Look at me
and put your fucking hands down!
Ah, your sweetheart's here.
Perfect timing.
I was sure it was Nadège.
That's great. You chose the filthiest one.
Yeah, that's right.
Fuck off, you little hussy.
You little shit!
Listen, Claude.
Don't say it. Don't say it.
We love each other.
That means nothing to you, does it?
You've never loved anybody.
Then get out!
Get out!
Get out.
Get out!
Get out.
Wait, wait, wait.
I've made a decision which is important.
No more men in my life,
or at least no love affairs anymore.
That's a bit sad, isn't it?
It's not me giving up or being desperate.
It's a choice.
You have to know when it's time to end it.
I guess each to their own.
The main thing is
to be happy in life, isn't it?
Not to depend on anyone.
Protected by money.
Power.
Fuck! That's enough!
No vulnerability.
No weaknesses. No Achilles' heel.
What's she doing?
She didn't tell me.
I think you should go and see your father...
instead of throwing everything away.
I've spoken to him. He's a good man.
You know my father? 7
Mm-hmm.
- Bonjour, girls.
- Bonjour.
- How are you today, Claude?
- Very well.
It's fine, Sidonie. You can leave us.
- I have to talk to you.
- Mmm, later.
Your friend Marcantoni's out of prison.
That's that.
Sixty thousand bail.
But they won't let him get away.
Heads are rolling.
This is just the beginning.
Very forthcoming. That's new.
Everything's changing, Claude.
Count yourself lucky you're still alive.
Everything's changing. Sure.
But for the moment, I'm your superior.
And your friends remain safe
in my address book.
If I asked you
to take someone down, would you?
It would depend who.
You're an amusing girl.
It's not playing around, you know.
It's a very evil old man.
Oh, yeah?
What is it he's done to you?
Something you should never do
to your seven-year-old daughter.
I should leave you be.
You sure you don't want to come?
No. I prefer to stay here.
Why would I want to go to Castel?
I'm not horny like you are.
You're heading towards trouble.
You look really terrible.
Time for me to go.
♪ My hopes are gettin' so much higher ♪
♪ My soul is burnin' inside, yeah ♪
♪ That flame is turnin' to a fire
Just like the change in the tide ♪
♪ I'll see the towns
From the north to the south ♪
♪ From the east to the west, yeah ♪
♪ All the cities, all the countries ♪
♪ Before that long, long rest, yeah ♪
♪ I'm going all the way, yeah ♪
♪ I'm going all the way ♪
♪ I'm going all the way, yeah ♪
♪ Whoo! ♪
Can you pass me that bag?
There you go.
Come on, come on, my dear. Don't panic.
Nothing bad's going to happen.
- I hope not.
- Of course it won't.
I'm such a fool, but it's because
I've never been so far away before.
I know. But three days isn't that long.
Come on.
Comet,
a new all-purpose laundry powder.
Comet cleans
much better and brighter.
No boiling, no foam.
Comet, a clean out of this world.
No news from Virginie.
We must do something.
- We're doing the most we can.
- "The most," my ass.
Calm down. We're not in Pigalle.
You're starting to scare the ducks.
It's about affairs of the state.
You comprehend that?
You have nothing to gain
from getting all worked up.
I'm very calm.
I didn't wait for you
to serve my country.
When I joined the Resistance...
Not with me.
I don't believe your nonsense.
We will trace her.
Things between the CAR and Chad
are complicated.
Talking of which, tell your darling
that Chad's over for her.
If she could keep her head down,
that'd be no bad thing.
That goes for everybody.
That's what they always called it.
Virginie never came back.
She was gone, too.
The wrong place at the wrong time.
She was a good girl.
Ending up like that...
I take comfort from the fact
hat lots of my girls go on to do well.
Acting or singing careers.
Some of them have even become princesses.
Aren't you eating, darling?
I've had enough.
When you were little,
it was difficult to get you to eat.
I just telling Serge,
you would never listen.
I met your boss.
She's a bit odd.
She thinks she's above the law,
but no one is.
And no one's above death, remember.
I want you to pay for what you did to me.
- What are you talking about?
- You remember.
You're a lunatic. It's either drugs
or shame about being a lesbian.
I've considered having you murdered,
or contacting the police.
You'll speak about it...
but you're weak-willed.
You're a coward.
Joyeux Noël.
Here you are.
Merci.
TO ANNE
MERRY CHRISTMAS, MY DAUGHTER
- What are you doing here?
- Can I talk to you?
Yes, of course.
- Is something wrong?
- No, I'm fine.
- You're really pale.
- No, it's fine.
I don't know
whether it came from above or below.
All I know is someone wanted me dead.
There's nothing I can do this time.
It's out of my hands.
Your friends are starting to desert you.
The police won't be of any help to you
You don't say.
You're too big for your boots, Fernande.
From this moment on,
I'd say that you're on your own.
You don't seem well.
When the police came over,
they searched the whole place.
They received a call
saying there was a dead body here.
Keep watching the window, please.
- What are you afraid of?
- Everything.
Go back upstairs. Inform the girls.
I'm shutting up shop for today.
Turn that on.
See if they're talking about it.
The problem? Jo's on his last legs.
Marcantoni is busted.
If word gets out that I'm weak,
they'll blackmail me or kill me.
Did you know Jo was unwell?
- Yes, but he told me not to say anything.
- He didn't want me to know?
Turn it down, please.
Down!
- Yeah?
- What have you heard?
I haven't heard anything.
So you're telling me that you don't know
who paid my chink to kill me?
All I know is, it's the end of an epoch.
"The end of an epoch"? Fuck you!
It's not the end!
Shall we talk about the coup in Chad?
And what about Bokassa?
Remember that, huh?
Marcantoni getting out of prison?
Listen, you've been making enemies.
You're lucky to still be alive.
He hung up on me! Asshole man!
Asshole man! Asshole man! Asshole man!
Claude.
- Serge knows my father.
- What did you say?
Serge knows my father.
I should have known
not to trust you. I shouldn't have.
We're not from the same world.
The same ones are screwed!
You must see it, huh?
Bringing me girls! I should have known!
- You think it's my dad?
- Your dad or not, it doesn't matter.
It's not any one!
And stop looking at me like that!
I ruined everything!
All that for nothing.
Everything I've gone through,
everything I've built, for nothing.
I've ruined everything.
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
The girl has been dealt with.
We'll do better next time.
We've closed down Boulainvilliers
for a breach of the peace.
She's cornered.
It's a matter of time before she falls.
Our team is taking care of it.
Good. Merci.
- Can I offer you a drink?
- I wouldn't mind.
Excuse me.
I took myself to the countryside
to wait for things to settle down.
With Boulainvilliers shut down,
my girls worked from home.
Most had been doing so for some time,
so it didn't really impact business.
But the good times were over
for our family.
It couldn't last forever.
Happiness never lasts long.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
I've been thinking recently.
I want to press charges against my father.
Hmm.
They couldn't give a shit
you were shagged by your father.
They really couldn't.
It's happened to others.
In my case,
it was my uncle, but I kept quiet.
- It's different now, though, you see?
- Nothing changes.
Nothing at all.
It's the men who decide.
The men who have the power.
That's unchangeable.
Wouldn't you like time to be alone?
You've plenty of money.
You're not getting any younger.
That's not for you to say.
As for you, poor girl,
you're a mess through and through.
You don't respect yourself.
You're talking to me about respect?
Listen, if you came to fuck around,
it's bad timing, huh?
When I return, I have 300 girls
waiting for me, 300 girls relying on me.
They weren't born
with a silver spoon in their mouth.
They're not doing this for fun.
So take your lover boy with you
and go away. Go on!
Just go away.
Au revoir, madame.
She's finished.
The old tart can give up.
Don't be mean to her.
It's not mean, it's the truth.
Sexual liberation,
you heard of it? Woodstock?
No free-thinking person
would think to pay to fuck anymore.
What do you know?
Well, I have a crime to report.
A rape.
And it was my father.
The one
joining the government?
Oh, my.
- You sure?
- Yes.
It's not the best idea.
Why? What will happen?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Really?
- Really. Nothing.
It'll be your word against his,
and they'll never believe you.
You're a prostitute.
I don't have anything against you.
Nothing personal.
But I'd get out of this car crash now,
if I were you.
Claude's in the shit, and that's that.
But you've an education.
From a good family.
Make a fresh start.
The lack of respect
is what finished Jo. That killed him.
I will miss him.
Me, as well.
You were right about my father.
I'm not going to press charges.
It's no use.
You see? I told you.
Now you have to come to terms with it.
After that,
nothing was ever the same again.
Pompidou is dead.
With those three words
from an Agence France-Presse newsflash,
we learned that at precisely 9:45 p.m...
...the president of the Republic
passed away.
The shocking news
took everyone by surprise.
For example, the countless other members
of the government...
Giscard had just been elected.
And with him, a new era.
My notoriety was a problem.
Tax authorities, open up!
- Yes, bonjour.
- Bonjour, madame.
- We have a warrant.
- Calm down.
The government would give me
a 10-month suspended prison sentence
and a fine of 11,000,000.
I was cornered.
Bonsoir, Claude.
Don't be surprised that I'm here.
I'm the angel sent to protect you.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
I've seen too many things.
That's why I'm here to speak with you.
Don't talk about all you've seen.
That admission won't help anybody.
Oh, no?
- They're modern, these interviews.
- Heh.
I'm keeping up with the times.
And I'm suggesting you keep schtum.
You're pissed off
I'm earning so much.
You've got to have balls to do that.
So tell your friends
I know very well what I'm doing.
You're not from their world.
You never will be.
Fuck off, you doormat.
I like you, so I'm watching your back.
They're ready.
So, I invited you to join me,
and you accepted that invitation,
because you've just published your memoirs
in a book explicitly titled Allô Oui.
This suggests
that the telephone was your main tool.
It was my main tool. Always.
I have to say that the picture
of human suffering that you present
comes with plenty of surprises.
We get the impression
reading what you've written
that you've been carrying out
humanitarian activities
for the last 15 years.
Yes. In fact,
you gentlemen have times
when you're a bit...
a bit lonely, a bit... a bit sad.
I try to fill those sad times
with a few moments of gaiety.
She's talking such bullshit,
and he has no idea.
She's not gonna
spill the beans on TV.
Remember those journalists
who wrote that book,
and how she did everything to stop them?
The countless phone calls
and multiple threats.
Bet there'll be
plenty to say. Like Virginie.
Case closed.
It's very poetic.
What are you looking at me for?
There are stories about me,
you, her, all of us...
It's just what life was like then.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Anne?
What are you doing here?
I was local and I saw that you were on TV.
Get in.
- Are you all right? Is it difficult?
- A bit.
In the end, I won't be free.
They'll catch up with me.
It's just the tax man.
It's not like I killed my child.
- You look well.
- I am.
You still have my ring?
Is that a wedding ring?
Yes. I'm married.
- Do I know him?
- No.
I'm having a child, Mom.
Fine.
Aren't you a bit young for that?
No.
Well, that means I'll be a grandma.
You could have told me earlier.
How? You changed your address.
Don't complicate things, will you?
I've got enough problems as it is.
Well, that's what I came here to say.
I wanted you to know.
Do you want a boy or a girl?
I don't know.
For your sake, a son.

You leaving already?
I'm tired of it.
I've been thinking about your father.
All my life, whenever I did anything,
I was told that I wouldn't succeed.
In the end, I succeeded.
I caught them unawares.
They were going to get me for tax evasion,
like Al Capone.
So I left for the US.
They didn't get me.
That same year,
the Marković case was dropped.
Grudet Fernande, it's time.
Today's the day.
America.
I stayed there a few years.
It wasn't the country for me.
Immigration took an interest in me.
I was deported.
Back to France.
I tried to stay out of trouble,
and I went back to doing what I knew best.
Fuck off, you hussy.
Bloody hell.
She doesn't pull any punches.
She definitely doesn't.
I was arrested
by the first female superintendent,
Madame Monteil.
How fitting.
Who does she think she is?
Open the gate]
I did my time.
Six months of pre-trial custody.
I'll attend my hearing a free woman.
Yes, it's her, in the flesh.
The living legend
of high-class prostitution.
Madame Claude, 69 years old,
real name Fernande Grudet,
is slightly annoyed by her media success.
"Because," exclaims Madame Claude,
"there's nothing to get worked up about!"
Did Madame Claude
reestablish a network of 20 or so girls?
"Oh, a very small network
with five regulars."
Recruiting? "You know,
I wasn't short of candidates."
And the rates?
Five thousand francs
for an afternoon rendezvous,
10,000 francs for an evening.
Bonjour,
you've reached Claude. Leave a message.
Hello?
I just...
Well, I just wanted to say to you...
that of all people, you've been
the most important my whole life.
You're the reason
I had the strength to press charges.
He's been convicted.
It's a pathetic sentence,
but even so.
"The girls all suffered exploitation,"
said the magistrate,
"and Fernande Grudet's amassed
too much wealth during her lifetime
to now be in the state of bankruptcy."
Claude, I also wanted to tell you that...
I loved you like I've never loved
anyone else in my life.
And I only left because...
it was to go
before you hurt me too much.
Like you've hurt others,
like you've hurt yourself.
And...
remember your goat.
Szpiner QC, for the defense,
requested leniency at the trial
of this undeserving old lady.
Yet Madame Claude left the court
shocked by the harsh conviction.
Three years in prison,
six months of which have already
been fulfilled in pre-trial custody,
and a fine of 1,000,000 francs.
I perhaps should go and steal
1,000,000 francs and hand it to the court.
I don't have the money.
It's a cruel dilemma.
But I leave that till tomorrow.
I have no complaints.
Life is good.
Solitude has never scared me.
And death?
Leave that till tomorrow.
MADAME CLAUDE DIED IN NICE
ON DECEMBER 15TH, 2015.
