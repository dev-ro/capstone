This is Yardley...
which is supposed to be a very
good liberal arts school,
and definitely tony enough
for my mother
with its beautiful
rural campus...
which is total bullshit
because you get ticks
walking in the grass.
Yardley has more structure
than the first college
I went to.
I lasted a few months
at one of those serious
Ivy League
pseudo-intellectual joints,
which my mother thought
would give me
an "appropriate" education.
She says I have a high I.Q.
and I'm not living up
to my potential,
even though last weekend
I made twenty grand
playing poker.
But I'll get to that.
Yardley's where I met Ashleigh
on the school paper.
That's my girlfriend,
Ashleigh Enright.
My dad knew one of her
father's banks in Arizona,
and naturally,
with those family credentials,
my mother wants us to get
married, sight unseen.
It's the one area I agree on
with my mother,
because even though
we've only been goin' out
for a few months,
- I'm hopelessly in love with Ashleigh.
- Gatsby!
I got an interview
with Roland Pollard.
Ohhh, my gosh,
that is amazing!
How did you land that?
- Um, well, he has a new movie coming out this fall...
- Mm-hmm.
and the assignment originally
went to Priscilla McCain,
but she's totally got mono,
so I'm doing it.
Gee, mono's like a two-credit
course at this school.
- Oh...
- Well, listen, Ashleigh, I think this is great for you.
- Yeah.
- When, w-when, when is it?
- Uh, it's the twenty-eighth of this month.
- Mm-hm.
- A Saturday.
- Okay.
- And it's on campus?
- Mm-mm.
It's in Manhattan.
It's in Manhattan?
Are you serious?
This is fantastic!
We're always talkin' about
going into Manhattan
for a special weekend.
Okay.
Look, I'm gonna make
a reservation at the Carlyle.
That's the place I'm always
tellin' you about with the...
the piano player at the bar.
He sings those old
Broadway tunes.
And, uh, I'll take you out
for lunch and dinner.
How does that sound?
Maybe I'll show you
around the city?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
I mean...
it'll cost a fortune.
Nah, relax, I'm loaded.
I scored twenty big ones
last Sunday.
Not another crap game?
No-no-no,
stud poker this time.
I'm sittin' there
with three tens,
and some guy with aces up
keeps raising me.
Oh. How do you get
all the money to play
in such a big poker game?
Well, my horse came in
this weekend.
I'm telling ya, this is why
I gotta go to Vegas.
I-I-I-I'm a gambler,
I don't know how else to put it.
Gosh...
I've always wanted you
to have to show me
around Manhattan.
I know, this is gonna be
absolutely fantastic.
Hey, I'm gonna maybe
get in touch
with my dad's ticket broker,
he can get us tickets
to "Hamilton"
how does that sound?
Actually, I don't want
to let my parents know
- I'm in town that weekend.
- Oh. Why not?
My mother's having her
big annual Fall Gala
- and she's apoplectic I'm not coming, and...
- Mm.
you know, I told her
I had a major paper due.
Otherwise, I'd have to put in
an appearance, and...
...it's like death,
it's like having...
drinks with a hundred
bullshit people,
not one of which has ever been
turned down by a co-op.
God, I can't believe it.
- An interview with the director of "Winter Memories".
- Yeah.
Hey, didn't we see
"Winter Memories" together
on our first date?
- I think so.
- I'm just so excited.
I mean, you have to help me
come up with a list
of profound questions
to ask him.
I don't want to come off
like a twit.
You're not gonna come off
like a twit.
And actually, now that
I'm thinking about it,
we can't stay at the Carlyle,
it's too close
to my parents' house...
but I want you
to have a park view...
You know what?
We're gonna stay at the Pierre.
That way you can have
a park view,
- it's a safe distance from my parents' house...
- Oh.
and then after dinner
we're gonna go to the Carlyle,
we'll go to the bar, and,
a-a-a-and spend some time there.
It's, it's very old New York.
Uh, uh, I, I really love it.
- The murals are by Ludwig Bemelmans.
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I've...
I've only been to Manhattan
twice, you know.
Once when I was two
and then once
when I was twelve.
All I remember is,
we got incredible bargains.
I mean, my parents could not
believe that you could buy
a Birkin bag and a Rolex
on a blanket off the street...
for only two hundred dollars!
Are there any other questions
you can think of
that I can ask him?
Find out who influenced him
more on love,
Denis de Rougemont
or Ortega y Gasset.
How do you always know
all that stuff?
I read, I just don't read
what they give us in school.
I mean, do I really
care who wins
between Beowulf and Grendel?
No, I don't.
Maybe if I had a little money
on it, but....
Mm... I don't know
why I'm so nervous.
I just....
No college reporter's won
a Pulitzer, right?
- I don't think so.
- You're gonna be fine.
Don't put so much pressure
on yourself.
I think it'll be great.
Listen, I want to see
the Weegee photos at MOMA,
and I booked us
a dinner at Daniel,
which is kind of
a nice place,
we can dress up for it,
it'll be really nice.
And I splurged on the suite
at the Pierre.
What the hell, right?
It's poker winnings,
it's not even real money.
- Oh....
- Gatsby, it's beautiful!
Well, I wanted to do
something special.
Wow.
Oh, and the flowers.
That's not me,
I don't know what that is.
Champagne.
Wow.
Oh, look at that view!
Wanted it to be high enough
so you could see Central Park.
Central Park.
Exciting.
Thank you so much, sir.
I really appreciate that.
Oh.
- Thank you.
- Do you think that, uh...
- later maybe we could take a carriage ride?
- Yeah.
If it doesn't rain.
We could ride in the rain.
It's very moody.
It's very romantic.
I prefer it.
What time is it?
Yeah, we should go,
'cause his hotel's downtown.
There might be
a little bit of traffic.
Oh, it's far?
It's in Soho.
You're gonna like Soho.
It was filled with
creative people.
Then it got commercial
and expensive,
so all the creative people
moved to Tribeca.
But then that got expensive,
so they all moved to Brooklyn.
Next move is back in
with their parents.
He's only giving me an hour.
That's good, we have
a one-thirty lunch reservation.
Oh. Well, what are you
gonna do while I'm upstairs?
I don't know.
I'll... stroll around Soho,
maybe visit my brother.
I can't tell you how nice it is
to be back in the city.
Tell you the truth,
if it weren't for you,
I don't know if I'd ever find
my way back to Yardley.
Well, what would you do?
Find some brilliant way
to ruin my life.
Hi, um, I'm here for
Mister Roland Pollard.
- Roland, this is Ashleigh Enright...
- Hi.
- ...from Yardley.
- How do you do?
Ashleigh, this is Roland.
The screening's all set up.
- We're running on a really tight schedule.
- Please.
First of all, I'd just like
to say that, uh, eh,
what an honor
this is for me.
I just want to say
you're by far
the most interesting
American director.
Thank you.
I write on the arts
for our paper
and I've always put you
right up in a class
with Renoir and De Sica.
I'm surprised to hear
that s-someone your age
is familiar with Renoir
and De Sica.
Oh, um...
well, film's my total thing.
I've seen all the
American classics.
Particularly the Europeans.
Kurosawa's my favorite.
- Um, I...
- Ah.
I mean, technically,
he's not European.
Technically, he's obviously
Japanese, but you...
really speak to my soul.
Um... what college
are you from?
- Yardley. It's small.
- Oh.
I know it well.
My first wife went there.
- Really?
- Yes, a brilliant woman.
Long blonde hair and
a state-of-the-art overbite.
Very sexy,
a philosophy major.
To tell you the truth,
I didn't deserve her.
And I... didn't end up with her,
either, so....
Oh. Well, uh, that's, uh...
neither hither...
nor yon, I'd imagine.
I guess... it's probably...
more yon than hither.
Are you from New York?
Mm-mn...
Tucson, Arizona.
What does your family do?
Agh,
I was afraid you'd ask.
My father owns banks.
Is that bad?
Well... I know what
you're thinking.
You know.
Republicans.
The one percent.
But we're not.
We're just, uh...
totally Episcopalians
who happen to just be rich.
That's how my Ashley was.
Well, who's your Ashleigh?
My first wife.
The one with the long
blonde hair
and the state-of-the-art
overbite.
Her name was Ashleigh?
A-S-H-L-E-Y.
Oh, well... tsk,
mine is A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H.
You use the Forbes Five
Hundred spelling.
Since, uh... this is your
first meaningful assignment,
would you like a scoop?
Of?
Umm...
inside information.
You've heard the term.
Oh, a scoop!
I'd rather share this
with you...
than some slick,
gossip-hungry newspaper hack.
My God.
You keep going,
I'm liable to have
one of my famous
psychological hiccup fits.
When I'm nervous,
I stammer.
Is that the scoop?
No, that's,
that's not the scoop.
The worst, of course,
is when I'm sexually conflicted.
Then I'll hiccup indefinitely.
Hm.
The scoop is...
I'm not happy with this film.
You're not?
I'm thinking of quitting...
actually.
That's the scoop.
Well, if I could speak
frankly, Mister Pollard...
you'll never have mass appeal.
You're too original.
I mean, you've never once
made one single
commercial concession.
You're a free creative spirit.
Like... Van Gogh,
or Rothko,
or Virginia Woolf.
Of course,
they all committed suicide.
That's a very sweet thing
to say, Ashleigh.
You should read me on you.
I wrote that your best work
is yet to come.
I mean, it's only in the,
you know, the...
Yardley Argus, but...
we have a good circulation.
You think that my best
work is yet to come.
I do.
I mean, I haven't seen
your new film,
- but I'm willing to bet...
- Would you like to?
I'd love to!
But I kn-, I know how...
secretive you are...
which I totally respect.
What are you doing now?
- Now?
- Yes, now.
I'm... I'm screening it
for Ted Davidoff,
who did the script.
Oh, I know who he is.
Yeah, he writes all your movies.
He's a genius.
I'm screening some...
last-minute changes.
Face-saving changes.
Well, how long does it run?
Uh, I guess I-I could shift
my lunch plans.
One thing about
New York City
you're here or you're nowhere.
You cannot achieve
this level of anxiety,
hostility,
and paranoia anywhere else.
It's really exhilarating.
Anyhow, I decided to treat
myself to a cigarette holder...
which makes me look dapper
and serves the double duty
of delaying the inevitable
onset of cancer
or emphysema.
I smoke too much.
So then who do I meet
but one of the most obnoxious
and revolting characters
from my high school.
Welles?
- Hey.
- Troller.
I heard you flunked out
of freshman year.
No, no.
I didn't flunk out.
Uh... I transferred up
to Yardley
because the first place I tried
was too unstructured.
Oh. The word around
is "flunked".
Nope.
Where the hell is Yardley?
Afghanistan?
Upstate.
- Hey, you hear about Finletter?
- No.
He got thrown out of Princeton
for passing bad checks.
- No, I didn't hear about that.
- Yeah, but big deal.
Because of his father,
he's got like
the all-time golden parachute.
He could commit mass murder,
he'd still have a cushy job
waiting for him.
- That's a weird way to put it.
- And Millstein is marrying Carol Durand!
Which...
I'll never understand
because she resembles
Yasser Arafat!
Not to mention,
she's an ice queen.
Yeah, well, you can't believe
everything that...
What are you doin' in town?
It's my girlfriend.
I'm just, uh...
showin' her around
for the weekend.
Oh.
Who's your girlfriend?
You wouldn't know her.
She's got a name,
hasn't she?
Ashleigh.
- Ashley.
- Mm-hm.
Like Ashley Wilkes
in "Gone with the Wind"?
That wimp?
- What about Josh Loomis?
- I just saw Josh.
He's shooting a movie
on Minetta.
- A movie?
- It's his student film.
This... N.Y.U. project.
It looked completely
stupid to me.
You should stop by.
He's with Evans
and the younger Tyrell.
You always liked Josh,
that Turner Classic wimp.
Did you say Amy's
younger sister was there?
Is Amy there?
Amy's at Vassar.
Big deal.
I'm impressed.
Flat chested.
Like two dimes
on an ironing board.
Amy was beautiful.
Yeah, if you like
Grace Kelly!
What are you in town for?
Just my girlfriend, uh...
she has an interview
with Roland Pollard
for the school paper.
Who's that?
It's a director.
He did "Winter Memories",
uh... "Moonglow".
Oh, yeah!
I can't stand his flicks.
All that... wimpy
emotional probing,
never a single decent
toilet joke.
- Yeah, well, uh...
- Hey, you should go and watch them shoot.
You could be in it.
They're lookin' for volunteers.
With that cigarette holder,
you could be the perfect
milquetoast nerd!
Okay, well, I'm runnin'
a little bit late.
Hey...
I wouldn't trust my girl with
a big-time Hollywood director.
Okay, good to know.
Hey, you didn't ask me
what I'm doin'.
What are you doing?
I'm only premed.
We have pull with the
board in Grenada.
I can't make lunch.
What? Why not?
- I have to see his film!
- You do?
Oh, it's an unbelievable
opportunity.
And then we're gonna discuss it
after and everything!
When did this develop?
I thought you just had
an hour with him.
So did I, but then he
started opening up to me.
- He did?
- Yeah.
He's going through this
real artistic crisis.
There's a real story here.
Well, we have a lunch
reservation.
Yeah, but, well, I mean,
you wouldn't want me
to have to say no
to the screening.
I mean, I'm here for work.
We'll have plenty o' time.
Well, when? A film's gonna
take a couple of hours.
Well, what, I mean...
it's one now.
The movie'll probably
be over around three
and then, you know,
we'll have all afternoon.
How'd you get friendly
so fast?
Oh.
He's going through, on this
whole self-sabotage trip.
Yeah.
It's a scoop.
Is that him?
Yes.
Oh, wow.
He's a lot older looking
than I thought.
It's a good look, though,
don't ya think?
- He's a sufferer.
- So what?
What's so great
about suffering?
You should hear him
talk about the arts.
He's so passionate.
I can see how all his leading
ladies fall in love with him,
Do you want me
to meet him or...?
- Oh, no... no, I wouldn't want you to spook him.
- It's okay.
No, he's a very
private person,
and distraught.
Yeah, okay, well...
I'll see you later
and I-I'll meet you
back at the Carlyle at three.
It's the Pierre.
The Carlyle's tonight.
What the hell is it
about older guys
that seems so appealing
to women?
Christ, all they are
is decrepit.
What's sexy about short-term
memory loss?
I don't ever want to get old.
Of course,
with my smoking habit
I'll be spitting blood
at forty.
Look, if she's gonna get some
big inside news story,
she, she's gotta put in time
with this guy.
Meanwhile,
it's gonna rain soon.
Hey! Gatsby!
Josh.
How are you?
- Hey, how's it goin', man? Nice to see ya.
- It's good to see you.
Look, I just ran into
Alvin Troller.
- He told me you were shootin' a short film down here
- Oh, yeah.
- and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, it's just my term project. It's nothin' big, yeah.
- Nice, nice.
How's, uh... Yardley?
Is that where you are?
It's okay, I'm not really
liking it too much.
I'd rather be goin' to school
in the city,
but you know my mother.
If it's not the perfect image,
she bites down on that
cyanide capsule
- she keeps for special emergencies.
- Oh, yeah?
No, I d...,
I didn't know that. I...
The only thing
I remember about them
is they had that, uh, fundraiser
for Jeb Bush, right?
- Yeah, the fund... right, right, right, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right, yeah, that was...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, listen, how are you?
How's life?
What, what, uhhh, what's,
what's goin' on here?
- What are you doin'?
- Uh, you know, just out here tryin' to create
- a modern film-noir classic, that's all.
- Okay. All right.
Do you want to be in it?
- No.
- Come on, man. Look.
- No. No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- We're just light on extras, okay?
- That's all right.
- We have all these people who were no-shows.
- Listen, I'm not an actor.
- You don't even have to talk or anything.
- Uhhh...
Seriously.
You just get in the car...
and then on "Action" you let
the girl out. That's it.
Okay, I don't have to talk?
- None. Zero words.
- Okay.
All right,
I can handle that.
- Okay. There we go.
- Sure.
You remember Chan,
don't ya?
- Chan Tyrell.
- Hi.
- Yeah, you're Amy's little sister, right?
- Yeah, good to see you.
Good to see you.
- Should we do this?
- Yeah, go ahead.
I like that coat, actually.
No, keep that on.
Hey, listen, I hear your
older sister's at Vassar now,
- am I right?
- Yeah, no, political science major.
Can you believe it?
I mean, Amy never heard the
news that Lincoln was shot.
My God, Chan Tyrell,
this is insane.
And you were a,
a little girl
- and now you're actually a li...
- A...?
- a young woman.
- Ah.
Mm, you're not gonna start
singing "Gigi", are you?
- I'm not gonna start singin' "Gigi",
- Uh, so, here's the story.
She is totally mad with lust
and she can't let go of you.
So, uhh, she kisses you
and then she bursts away.
Right. Chan Tyrell.
Incidentally, I apologize in
advance for ruining your scene.
I'm... not an actor.
Oh, I'm not an actress,
either.
I'm just helping out
a friend.
And we kiss?
Yeah. That's why I never
wanted to be an actress.
You gotta fake...
passion with all kinds
of weirdos.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, but never mind.
Just... kiss me so I can
really feel it in my toes.
I used to kiss
your older sister.
She ever say anything
about that or no?
Mmm, I don't know...
I don't recall.
I think maybe she said
you were a four.
- A four?
- Yeah.
- I don't know, maybe a six.
- She said I was a four?
Maybe a six,
I can't recall.
Just this kiss, I,
I want it to be... hot.
If we're gonna do it,
let's... do it right.
- Oh, good work ethic.
- Thank you.
And... action.
Cut.
Hey... are you gonna
keep your mouth closed?
I have a girlfriend, Chan.
I don't think I can do this.
Uh... I'm sorry,
I think I froze.
You have a girlfriend?
Who's your girlfriend?
He name's Ashleigh.
She's from Yardley.
Well, she's from Tucson,
originally.
Tucson?
You're dating a girl
from Arizona.
Do I have your permission?
What do you guys talk about,
cactus?
Rattlesnakes.
Wow. Arizona.
That'll be great
for your asthma.
Tsk.
I don't have asthma.
That's funny,
when we were kissing,
I, I thought I heard
you wheezing.
You know,
I always remembered you
as a very snotty kid.
Uh... ready?
Yeah, well,
wh-what are you up to now?
I'm studying design
at the Fashion Institute.
Oh, that's unique.
Rolling.
Scene nineteen, take two.
Action.
Uh, cut.
It's, uh, better.
- Josh, he's way too uptight to open up his mouth.
- Chan...
Hey, are you still
seeing that shrink?
Gimme a break, all right?
I was just takin' a walk,
he asked me to help out,
all right?
I've never acted before.
Scene nineteen, take three.
Action.
Josh, it's, uh,
starting to rain.
And cut.
Great.
See?
I knew you could do it.
- Hey, Josh!
- And I won't tell your girlfriend.
Hey, Josh, you liked it?
You want a different version?
No, no-no-no-no-no,
we're good with that version.
That's the version,
we're stickin' with that. Okay.
All right, well,
have fun in Arizona,
and whatever you do,
don't get lost in the desert
and die of thirst.
I'll be sure to bring
a canteen.
Oh, don't fall in
the Grand Canyon, too.
It's really deep.
She always was the
pain-in-the-ass kid sister.
How could she not be?
Amy was gorgeous
and so sexually advanced.
Word on Amy was she performed
oral sex at a bar mitzvah.
I think they should make that
part of every Jewish holiday.
It certainly beats fasting.
It's also a great way to
celebrate the Jewish New Year,
and what a great
Hanukkah gift.
I wonder what's been
bothering Hunter.
Something was definitely
on his mind when I called him.
- Gatsby!
- Sur-, surprise.
- What? Aaaaw!
- Hey, yeah, I told you I might drop in.
- That's crazy, what?
- Listen, if you got somethin' to do,
- I can come back another time and take a...
- No! I got nothing to do!
- It's good to see you.
- Hey! How are ya?
- Oh, buddy! Man!
- Doin' well.
I'm good, I'm good.
You?
- Good, good, no complaints.
- That's awesome.
You come in for Mom's party?
No. So you can't tell her
I'm here, okay?
- Gee.
- It's okay, Hunter. You can pull it off.
You're engaged
and outta the house now.
- She's not gonna take your phone away.
- Hmmmm.
If Mom finds out,
she'll die.
No, she won't,
she'll live...
and she's not gonna find out.
Well, how come you're in?
Oh, it's Ashleigh,
uh, my girlfriend.
She has to do an interview
with Roland Pollard,
- the film director, for the school paper.
- That... Ohh.
- It's a big coup.
- Ashleigh.
That is the one
that Mom's high on.
- She's never even met her.
- Okay.
Hunter,
your parents want to...
- Oh, hey, Gatsby!
- Hey.
- It's so good to see you!
- It's good to see you. How are you?
I'm good. What are you
doin' in town?
- See, his girlfriend is interviewing Roland P..., uhh...
- Sit.
- Pollard, he's a film director, but...
- Ooh.
do me, do me a favor
and don't tell my mom I'm here,
- I'm not goin' to her big party tonight, yeah, yeah.
- He hates parties!
- He's Mister Antisocial.
- What?
You always hated Mom's
literary salons.
It's rich housewives
who have the leisure
to pursue esoteric culture.
The out-of-work discussing
the out-of-print.
She only wanted to make sure
that we were exposed
to great literature.
Okay, what about Jimmy Cannon,
then?
All right,
what about Tom Adair?
It's not all giant insects
and madeleines.
Hey, you're not gonna duck out
of our wedding, are you?
How can he?
He's the best man!
Come on.
He cries at weddings.
He... well, he's not so tough
as he makes out.
He cries at weddings
and funerals.
Same reason.
All right, um, I'm gonna
go take a shower,
- but there's coffee.
- Sure.
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Hey, it's nice being here!
I always liked her.
Gatsby?
- What's the matter?
- Gatsby.
I don't want to go through
with this wedding.
What?
I can't do it.
I can't.
And I can't pull out now.
It'll kill her.
There's two hundred
guests invited.
They booked...
the Century Club.
They booked an orchestra.
Oh, God, save me!
Wait, eh, but...
Okay, all right,
what... what happened?
- You'll think I'm so stupid.
- I'm not gonna think you're stupid.
- Just tell me what happened.
- I can't. It's too stupid.
I, I...
Y-Y-You're making me anxious.
I want to hear this fascinating
piece of stupidity.
- Uh, well, she's, she's bright.
- Mm-hm.
Gatsby, she's nice,
she's kind.
So?
I can't stand the way
she laughs.
- What?
- Yeah, I can't take her laugh.
- Her laugh?
- Yes.
Yeah, her laugh.
Her laugh!
Hunter, that's probably
the most idiotic thing
I've ever heard in my life.
I told you you'd think
it's stupid.
What's wrong with her laugh?
Listen to it.
It's a total turnoff.
- How much do you love her?
- But I do!
I love her, I love her!
It's just her laugh!
If you love her,
then get over it.
I can't. I've tried.
I've tried, I've tried.
Last night,
we were talkin' in bed,
and she laughed and I couldn't
m-make love to her.
What?!
- I couldn't. I was impotent.
- Just...
From her laugh?
- It's happened before.
- Hunter, you gotta see a shrink.
What?
- I'm serious, you gotta see...
- I don't need a shrink,
I know what the problem is.
She has a fatal laugh!
It-it, uh, it, uh, a cross
between Dad's sister Betty
and... Lennie in
"Of Mice and Men".
I've never heard of
a problem like that before.
Well, you're young, Gatsby.
The world is full of tragic
little deal-breakers.
Haven't you been seeing Lily
for over a year?
Wh-wh-why is this
comin' up now?
Have you talked to her
about it?
Uhh, yeah, I...
brought it up, tactfully,
but I d-, I don't think
she realizes
how serious it's gotten.
I love her.
But I can't marry her, Gatsby.
I won't be able
to have sex with her.
No, no, you mean you don't
want to marry her,
so you're focusing
on this laugh insanity.
Oh, please, spare me
the fruits of your
Upper East Side talking cure.
Listen to her laugh.
When she comes down,
we'll get her to laugh.
You'll s... see what I mean.
Oh... agh... aaggh,
agh-agh-agh.
I can't... mm...
- I, I can't do this, I'm sorry.
- Rollie.
- I know. I, I, I'm, I'm sorry, Ted.
- Rollie, come on.
- It's just actually, it's physically...
- Don't do this.
- making me sick. I have to...
- Don't do this.
- It's humiliating.
- It's a process, Rollie.
- No, the changes... are shit.
- Rollie, sit down.
- Everything that I did is shit.
- They're not shit. Different, different.
- Mister Pollard.
- No... it's, uh, different...
Not all the changes work,
but some are good.
Thank you for coming,
Ashleigh.
I need to get a little air.
- It's a process.
- I need some space.
- Come and sit down.
- I need time.
- Don't do this.
- I need to think. I'm...
Don't... No booze.
Please, no booze.
- What?
- Come on.
You just watched two hours
of an existential
steaming shit pile
and that's all that you
can say to me?
- It's a process. We...
- Ted?
- We-we do this every time.
- Ted?
Rollie, come on back.
Don't drink!
- Oh, God.
- Well, shouldn't we go after him?
That's the sure sign
he is gonna drink.
Hey, you go.
You can go.
I, I, I have to watch it all...
to, to be able to talk to him
intelligently about it.
Oh, well....
No, I...
I love the movie so far.
You do?
I do.
Let's go back.
There's a high-stakes
card game later
at the Freemont Hotel.
I can't make it, but I know
you love that kinda thing.
You want me to call Joe Cohen,
say you'll take my chair?
I would love a high-stakes
card game,
- I'm loaded right now, but, uh...
- Yeah.
Ashleigh and I,
we have plans tonight.
I'm dyin' to meet Ashleigh.
I know. I don't know
where she is right now.
I was supposed to show her
the city today.
Well, you better take
an umbrella.
Watch, I'll make her laugh.
Oh! Hey!
I was just tellin',
uh, Gatsby,
Larry Nash told me
a great joke.
Two cannibals are eatin'
a comedian and one says,
"Hey, do you taste
somethin' funny?".
That is so unfunny.
- D... Umm... okay.
- Okay! That's my cue.
Hunter, lovely to see you,
as always.
- Uh, so great to see you.
- Lily, thank you for the coffee, and...
- Wait. I heard one more.
- Sure.
A homeless man stopped
a Jewish mother
on the street and said,
"Lady, I haven't eaten
in three days,"
and she said,
"Force yourself."
Hello? Ashleigh,
what's goin' on?
You said you were gonna call me
thirty minutes ago.
I know.
The film got delayed.
I'm, uh, I'm up at this,
uh, screening room place.
It's fine, just meet me at
the Museum of Modern Art,
it's on Fifty-third Street.
We'll grab a bite to eat there
and then we're gonna go
see the Weegees.
I, I can't.
I can't.
What do you mean?
Why not?
Because I'm onto
a real story here.
This is a
seventy-million-dollar movie
and Rollie's very
unhappy with it.
You call him Rollie?
Yeah, and Ted and I,
we have to find him.
We have to find him
and talk with him
before he has one
of his crazy fits
and then re-edits the whole
thing and ruins it.
Who's Ted?
Gatsby, I-I-I can't
talk right now,
but I'll call you as soon
as I'm through.
And, um, if, uh...
I'm running late,
I'll just meet you back
at the Plaza.
It's not the Pla...
It's the Carlyle!
It's the, it was the bar
and the piano for tonight!
Well, he's not at the hotel,
and...
he didn't show up for
the press interview, so...
he's wallowing in
self-loathing somewhere,
drinking Courvoisier,
thinking up new ways
to screw up our work.
Oh, I thought the film was
full of wonderful things.
Me, too. Tell him. You...
Tell him, tell Rollie,
because hearing that from me
won't mean anything.
I'm always at...
this end of the argument.
But you, a fresh, honest,
new-generation woman,
especially a pretty one,
maybe...
He may...
Come on, let's find him.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Come on.
He doesn't like
her laugh?
Now, Ashleigh's laugh
is perfect.
Let's go, Ashleigh.
We're blowing the day,
and it's so moody out.
We could be on the ferry...
or the top of the
Empire State Building...
in black and white.
- Yeah, yeah, he was here.
- He was here?
He seemed very distraught.
- He knocked back a couple of brandies.
- Yeah.
Mumbled somethin' about
heading out to the studio.
Okay.
Let's get my car
and it's out to Queens.
- Oh, Queens.
- Yeah, it's a big... film studio.
You still want to come?
Oh, definitely.
Yeah.
When, when Rollie gets drunk
and morose,
he likes to wander around
the soundstages
- and pretend he's Norma Desmond.
- Oh.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Thanks.
Could I ask you
a few questions,
since I am on assignment?
Oh, sure.
What's your favorite film
of Rollie's?
"Winter Memories".
The one in Venice.
And when did you
first see it?
It was with Gatsby,
actually.
It was on our
very first date.
Hm.
The dialogue made me
want to kiss him.
That line about love
and death
being two sides
of the same coin.
Hm.
Did you understand it?
Um... no.
I got confused and,
and, and felt insecure,
and like I wanted to
just be held and kissed.
You ever been to Venice?
No.
But Gatsby has.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Oh, I... I knew it.
I knew it, I knew it!
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God!
You, um,
you turned all white.
I knew it!
She was lying!
- Who?
- Connie, my wife!
- She's seeing Lipshitz!
- Who's Lipshitz?
She said she was going
shopping with her sister
in Connecticut, but...
she's walking into
Lipshitz's building!
Oh, is Lipshitz a spy?
What?
No, Larry Lipshitz!
- My friend, my best friend!
- Mm.
My best friend!
I can't believe it.
She must... I mean,
they're having an affair.
Oh, God.
Are... are you okay?
You're clutching your heart.
Okay, here's what we do.
We sit here,
w... uh, we wait until
she comes out,
and then I'll confront her.
Uh... I hope
there's not a gun
in your glove compartment
like in your movies.
You'd better go.
You go.
No, I can't leave you alone!
You're all white and shaky.
Breathe.
Deeply. Breathe.
Deeply.
Doctor Ross said breathe.
Deeply.
Breathe deeply.
Breathe. Breathe.
No, not you. Me.
Oh, God.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Oh...
- Oh, hey!
- Oh, my God, Chan! What are you doing here?
- Hey, I'm just...
- What the hell? You were shoot...
- Hey, you take it. I'll get the next one!
- No, no, get in.
- I'll... Let's go.
- Are you sure?
- I'll drop you.
- Hey, where you goin'?
Oh, you remember.
The same Fifth Avenue joint.
I remember your apartment
well from my days with Amy.
Yeah, I remember
you calling for her.
My parents kept
warning her about you.
Warning? Why the hell
would they be warning her?
Because on a first date you
took her walking in the rain
and she got bronchial
pneumonia.
For Chrissake,
I'm never gonna get over this.
You can't get it
from being wet!
Don't yell at me,
I thought it was romantic.
That's because it is romantic.
It's a romantic gesture.
That's what I'm saying.
I always tell that
to Ashleigh.
She thinks I'm nuts.
Who's Ashleigh?
The rodeo queen
you're dating?
She's not a cowgirl.
She comes from one of the
biggest banking families
in Tucson.
She, she was a debutante,
actually.
- She came out.
- She came out? Is she gay?
No, she's not gay.
She's charming
and beautiful,
and we're supposed
to have this...
goddamn weekend
in the city together,
and suddenly she's
bogged down
with all these interviews
for the school paper.
She's ambitious.
You should find that admirable.
It's one, it was supposed
to be one little,
one... tiny little
lousy hour interview.
Instead... you know...
lost the whole
goddamn weekend.
Will you just relax?
I don't really know why...
Look, I, I'm havin'
a hard time relaxing, Chan,
'cause this was gonna be
a... a special weekend.
Instead I'm out here in the...
you know,
wandering the streets
like Hagar
in the goddamn desert
or something!
Well, don't tell me,
tell her.
Tell her to get her
priorities straight.
You want to drink some wine,
walk in the rain
- and give her bronchitis.
- Mm.
Okay, look.
She's apparently onto
a very big story.
She takes her job
very seriously, all right?
Fine, then get over it.
I, I, um...
I'm in the process
of getting over it.
Unless you're worried
somebody's hitting on her.
What the hell
does that mean?
I don't know.
Is she interviewing
attractive men?
I, I haven't really
thought about it.
I don't know.
Some might say they're
interesting?
Well... then maybe
you'd better step in
and assert yourself.
- Oh, you think I gotta be more demanding?
- I would.
These are like movie big shots
she's hangin' out with.
- Like...
- Suits?
Yeah, it's a director
and a screenwriter.
Artists.
They're usually passionate.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Okay, you're right,
I gotta call her now.
Tsk. I mean, the sooner
the better. I...
- You think there's that much of a rush?
- I don't know.
Aw, Christ, all right.
All right, it's your idea.
What do, so,
what, what, uh...
what do you think
I should say?
Well, there's nothing
you can say.
- What do you mean?
- Without sounding possessive, it's, ugh...
Christ, Chan, you just
encouraged me to call her!
Now I'm asking for your help
and you're just,
you're tellin' me
there's nothin' I can say?
You're so wishy-washy!
I mean, now that I see
your M.O.,
I know exactly why Amy
eighty-sixed you.
Oh, no, no, no.
Amy didn't dump me.
Eh, I got sick o' seein' her.
Yeah. Because every time
you'd call
and I'd say it was you
on the phone...
she'd wave her arms
and say,
"I'm not in, not in."
Hey, Gatsby?
Hey, Ashleigh.
Listen, um... look,
I know you're very busy.
That's why we came to New York,
right?
And no one has more respect
for honest ambitions than I do.
Do I have to listen to this
without an airsick bag?
Uh, I can't talk to you
right now.
I'm, I'm kind of involved
in a situation.
We had a number of things
planned for today.
I-I'm just, I-I'm very busy
right now, but I-I...
I really, I can't explain
it over the phone.
Ashleigh, we were talkin'
about one movie interview.
What could possibly be
so secretive about that?
Eh, wh-what's so C.I.A.?
Unless there's some funny
business going on.
Unless there's some
funny business goin' on.
I-I'll talk to you later.
Uh... bye, Gatsby.
All these goddamn
cell phones are...!
I don't know.
To me, it sounds dubious
to the max.
Yeah, it sounds
dubious to you
because you have
a sinister mind.
You must really love her.
I do,
she's a breath of fresh air.
She's charming
and delightful.
She's pretty.
She's sexy somehow,
at the same time.
She's witty.
She sings very nicely,
she plays the flute.
Hey, I don't know how
to break this to you...
but I'm sick of hearing
about her, okay?
Was that your boyfriend?
Gatsby? Yeah.
- Are you still dizzy?
- Nah, I'm okay.
What's... Gatsby do?
He goes to Yardley, too.
Which he refers to
as Forest Lawn University.
Is he a journalist, too?
No. He's not really focused
professionally.
I think, uh,
in his wildest dreams
he'd like to be Sky Masterson.
- A Broadway bookie?
- Yeah.
- Ha-ha.
- He's a little eccentric.
In what way... eccentric?
Well...
I think it has to do
with the fact that he
and his mom never really
hit it off, you know?
Uh, she was always forcing him
to read everything
and learn piano and...
I mean, he is really smart.
Yeah, he's one of those
students who
he doesn't have to study
for a test and then he just,
you know, aces it.
Sounds like me.
To tell you the truth, I'm...
Don't tell anybody, but...
I think he has a touch
of Asperger's.
- Whoo!
- Hey, you know what, Chan?
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna get out here, too.
Argh.
- What are you doing now?
- Why?
Uh, why?
Because I got a little bit
of time to kill
and I thought about goin'
to the Modern Museum,
at the Weegee exhibit.
Oh, I see.
You've got nothing
better to do,
so you want me
to keep you company?
You know what?
Forget it.
I dated your older sister.
You always had a little bit
of an attitude.
Okay, I'm not looking
for any trouble.
I've got to check out
some paintings
at the Met
for fashion class,
if you want to keep
me company.
I don't know why
you couldn'ta just, uh...
Fine.
It'll be fun.
We can get on
each other's nerves.
All right, let me change.
I'm soaked.
Are you hungry?
I'd give you
an Arizona lunch,
- but we're all out of beef jerky.
- Ah.
Oh, boy.
This brings back
a lotta memories.
Oh, my folks are in East Hampton
for the weekend.
Yeah?
How come you didn't go?
I've got a date tonight.
- You?
- Don't be so startled.
It turns out I'm desirable.
Oh, yeah?
Who's the unfortunate victim?
You wouldn't know him.
He's a girlfriend's...
dermatologist.
Tsk, that's romantic.
Hm.
Don't forget to show him
those three irregular
black moles on your back.
I'm... sure they're nothing.
I really hope I don't regret
not going to the Hamptons.
- Yeah, but then you'd...
- The beach is so pretty in the rain, too.
Would you have to be
with your parents?
So what?
I... love my parents.
You, you know them.
Yeah, they're fun.
Don't you have fun
with your parents?
Nah, fun's not the word
I would use.
All right,
I'll be right back.
Hey, listen,
can I play your piano?
Yeah, go ahead.
It's a family heirloom.

I love a cocktail lounge
piano...
outside, a drizzle...
grey...
New York City
enveloped in a light mist.
Two lovers have a date
to meet at six o'clock.
At Grand Central Station.
Under the clock,
like in the movie.
I love that movie, but...
I see it outside.
Mm-uh...
at the East River?
Where the tugboats
are on the water.
I love tugboats.
Almost.
You're in the right ballpark.
I know!
I know.
Under the clock.
Which clock?
The Delacorte Clock,
where all the animals go
around in Central Park.
Ahh. I love it.
It's very old movie.
My mom and I used to watch
old movies together
all the time.
She would study the decor.
I don't know,
they're so fabulously escapist.
In my version,
he's waiting...
the music plays...
and she never comes.
Or she's waiting...
and he chooses
the other woman.
Can't they just kiss
in the rain?
That sounds
pretty good to me,
even if it is commercial.
- Picture yourself.
- Okay.
It's one minute to six...
you're pacing up
and down...
raindrops are just
startin' to fall...
you're at your Delacorte Clock
in Central Park...
expecting your dermatologist!
But he's just diagnosed
a carcinoma on his own lip.
It's metastasizing
as you wait.
All right,
will you give me a break?
In my version,
everything's fine.
He... meets me
and holds me... kisses me.
It's lovely.
Nobody needs a biopsy.
Connie!
- Connie!
- Ted.
Is this... how you're
shopping with Judy in...
- in Connecticut?
- What are you doing here?
Oh, I happened to see you
out the window...
- from the car...
- Uh-huh.
- by sheer chance.
- Oh-h-h, really?
- Well, that's awkward, isn't it?
- Awkward?
Awkward?
You've been sleeping with him
for months... haven't you?
- Look, we were gonna tell you.
- When?
- When, when, when, when we moved to London?
- No.
Your dream...
that we'd move to London?
- Look, it just happened, Ted.
- Oh.
- We, we both fought it.
- Yeah, I'm sure you fought it.
In every hotel room,
on every mattress.
- In the backseat of ev...
- You know, this isn't about sex.
It's... always about sex.
- Everything's about sex.
- All right.
- The economy's about sex.
- Okay, you know what?
- I can't have this outburst with you on the street.
- You... with my best friend...
...is such a cliché.
I can't believe it.
Don't get down on Larry.
He adores you.
He identifies with you.
I know.
He uses my aftershave...
and my wife.
- Who is she?
- Ted!
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, what's that got to do with anything?
- Who is she?
- No, no... everything's fine.
Stay there, Ashleigh.
Keep dry.
- Um... I'm with the, uh, Yardley Argus.
- The what?
- No, she...
- The Yardley Argus.
She's a reporter
doing a piece on Rollie.
On Rollie?
Well, then what is she doing
with you following me?
Don't try
and turn this around.
- I'm not turning...
- Don't try and turn this around...
you've been caught.
- You were caught.
- When?
You, you who make
a fool of yourself
over every young
ambitious starlet and,
- and model and...
- No, whoa, whoa, what are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You've been having an affair
with Larry Lipshitz.
Yeah, and you were spying
on me with who...
- your fifteen-year-old concubine?
- She's a journalist.
- Tsk, oh, I'm twenty-one.
- She's twenty-one.
- Oh, she's twenty-one.
- She's a journalist.
- I have proof of age, actually.
- No, you don't need to show...
- Oh, really?
- You don't need to do that.
- This always happens in bars.
- Aww.
- You've been caught.
- Do you know what?
As long as you're a reporter,
I would like to, uh,
make a press release
about my husband.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, can I, uh, write this down?
- Oh, rea...
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Ashleigh, please.
Ask him how many times
he has been unfaithful to me.
No, you're demented.
She's demented.
- You're demented.
- His secretary.
- Wrong.
- The actresses.
Wrong.
- Oh! The poetess?
- The poetess?
- Uh, were all these women for pleasure?
- Taxi!
She...
Stop filling her head with lies.
Ashleigh, come here.
Take this...
address to the studio, okay?
Find Rollie.
Come on. Find Rollie.
Oh, I-I-I, I don't know my way
around New York.
It's okay.
Tell the cab driver.
Find Rollie.
- Ask him if he ever slept with Samantha Leroy.
- Stop.
You know,
the Argus is not a tabloid.
Yeah, there are no papers
that are not tabloids.
Encourage him about the movie
so he doesn't mangle
it and ruin it, okay?
Please, don't print
any of this!
Oh, don't worry.
- We always protect everybody.
- I'm, I'm sure.
Connie!
Connie!
You know, the first time
I kissed your sister
was in this museum.
I know, she told me.
She said that you were looking
at a Hieronymus Bosch
and it made you feel romantic,
so then you kissed her.
That's when she knew your shrink
wasn't helping you.
Yeah, well, don't tell me
she thought the kiss was a four.
If she quoted you
a figure higher,
I'd have her audited.
There's something charming
about that elegance.
My mother would have
liked Sargent
to have painted her
in just that pose.
They dressed so beautifully
in Paris back then.
I could see
movin' to Paris.
Mm, I never really asked you...
what are your future plans,
Gatsby?
I don't know,
I'm floundering.
What does that mean?
I don't know
what I want to be.
I just... know what
I don't want to be.
Is that terrible?
So you've got no game plan.
Well, I know I don't want
to be a, a-a test pilot,
or a clergyman,
or a proctologist,
so I ruled those out.
I get it.
You don't fit in.
That's why I always
had a crush on you
when you dated Amy.
You had a crush on me?
I did.
Isn't that weird?
I don't know,
maybe it's because you
took her to do oddball things...
like you took her
to those divey piano bars
where no one else
ever took her.
I did take her to her
first crap game.
I know, and I loved that.
I loved hearing every detail.
I was hoping she would get
serious with you,
because you were not
like all the other
idiots she dated.
I thought you were
a special idiot.
Well, I'm glad
I impressed you, Chan.
I remember Amy came home
and she told me
that you took her to the boat
basin in Central Park
and made love to her.
She told you about that?
Every moist detail.
Well, now I'm embarrassed.
Don't be.
That night she gave you a six.
She gave me a six.
Amy.
With an asterisk.
She said you were
a little... tense.
Yeah, well, Central Park
can be a little dangerous
at two A.M.
- But very romantic.
- Okay.
And then it started to rain.
Yeah, that was the best part.
Her, her hair got wet,
her...
clothes started to cling
to her body.
She started sneezing.
Yeah, I don't really
remember that part.
Now that I think of it, Chan,
you, you...
you always were around
givin' me the fish-eye.
You're just
realizing this now?
Mm-hm.
"Mm-hm?"
That's all you got to say?
You didn't... think I was
cute or attractive, anything?
Yeah, you seemed fine.
You mean I had no physical
deformities.
I didn't have acromegaly
or a hunchback.
You know what, Chan,
I wasn't really
paying attention,
'cause I was a little tense
in front of your parents and,
I, I mean, Amy,
Amy would make her entrance
lookin' like goddamn
Miss America.
I'm sure Ashleigh's
a beauty queen type.
Sh-, she is ac...
well, she was an actual
first-place winner
at her high school
in Tucson.
Four-H, right?
Yeah. How'd you,
how'd you guess?
Ink it in.
Let's get outta here.
Look at these
crazy Egyptians.
They put all their
money on an afterlife.
Listen, Gatsby.
Let me tell you,
you only live once.
But once is enough
if you find the right person.
Hey, listen, you think she's
givin' me the runaround today?
I'm, uh...
yeah, I'm strugglin'
to keep my spirits up.
Boy, you really are hooked
on her, aren't you?
Oh, my God!
That's my aunt and uncle.
They're here for
my mother's party.
- What party?
- They're here for my mother,
they, my mother's
party tonight!
- They're gonna tell her I'm here!
- Okay.
I can't discuss this,
I've gotta hide. I've, I, uh...
Why don't you duck
into the mummy case?
I'll get some white tape.
Hello?
Gatsby!
Yeah, I finally got alone.
Um, where are you?
Let me put it this way.
Have you heard o' King Tut?
You're where?
Wait, what are you doing?
Hello?
Gatsby, hello?
Gatsby!
Gatsby, what a surprise!
I was about to call
your mother.
Hi.
Uh, can I help you?
I'm looking for
Roland Pollard.
Roland Pollard.
Right, right.
He was here earlier.
Uh, I'm not sure
if he's still back there.
Mom, it was all planned,
okay?
Ashleigh and I wanted
to surprise you tonight.
I happened to run into
Uncle Tyler
and Aunt Grace, okay?
But don't worry,
we're gonna be there for dinner.
It's gonna be a great time.
I just, I thought it would be
a, a, a fun... surprise.
Oh, and we spoiled
your surprise.
Mister Pollard?
Rollie?
Hello.
Can I help you?
Have you seen Mister Pollard?
Ah, Rollie's gone.
He left an hour ago.
Oh.
Well, did he seem okay?
Well, to...
to be honest,
he... he, he seemed
a little drunk to me.
Are you two friends?
Oh, my God.
You're Francisco Vega.
Is that good or bad?
If my roommate was here,
she'd hemorrhage.
I mea... I... I mean,
she thinks you're the greatest
thing to come along
since the morning-after pill.
Um... me, too.
I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I can't believe I'm talking
to Francisco Vega.
Oh!
I mean, look at me.
I'm... I'm a journalist
and I'm reduced
to total adolescence.
It's, uh, just you're...
you're Francisco Vega!
I know that.
I guess the key question
here is, who are you?
Who, who am I?
Is what, that what you're
asking, who I am?
- I'm, uh, my identity?
- Yeah.
Is it coming to you?
Oh, I, um... Oh, uh...
I can't believe I'm blank...
I can't believe
I'm blanking on it.
Check your driver's license.
Right.
Yeah, okay. Right.
Okay, um, oh, mm...
I'm Ash...
I'm Ashleigh Enright.
I knew it would be on there.
Yeah.
I, um...
...well, I'm, I work
for the Yardley Argus.
- I write for them.
- Mm.
And I'm here in New York
because I'm interviewing
Mister Pollard.
Wow.
You look exactly the same,
but better.
Uh, let me tell you something.
You look more beautiful than
any journalist I've ever met.
- Francisco!
- You would make a very sexy anchorwoman.
How can you say that
when you're in the papers
every week
with those to-die models
and actresses?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah! Get in.
- Where are we going?
Not now, guys.
Not now, come on!
Give us a break!
Come on!
No.
Should I be in here?
Make yourself at home.
- Would you like to sit down?
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Would you like a drink?
- Oh, no, thanks.
Would you like to have
dinner with me?
Would I like to have
what with you?
- Yeah. I have no plans but to...
- Oh.
get an early bite
and then...
you and I can go to
a party together.
Oh, a party.
Oh, dinner. Um.
Oh...
Um...
Well, um, w-what about
Tiffany Griffin?
- I... I mean, I thought you...
- Ah, don't worry, don't worry.
- you two were a twosome.
- No, we just broke up.
- I'm gonna change into my street clothes...
- Okay.
while you think about it,
okay?
Uh-huh.
Oh...
Oh, gosh.
Great, now I gotta take
Ashleigh to my mom's...
goddamn party.
Why is that so bad?
Why is that so bad, Chan?
Because I wanted to spend
the night
with Ashleigh alone
in New York,
not with a farrago of WASP
plutocrats.
"A farrago of WASP
plutocrats"?
Sounds like something
on the menu
at a fusion restaurant.
I'm not interested
in the euro
or how many Basquiats
somebody owns
or whether they prefer
a Falcon to a Gulfstream.
I mean, these things
have no meaning to me.
I notice you haven't renounced
your family's money.
What does that mean?
That means you could
move out... get a job
put yourself through college.
Oh, yeah?
As a what?
Piano player in a dive.
Or... maybe a poker player?
Dice hustler?
You're bad, Chan.
You're goin' straight to hell.
There's something romantic
about gamblers and...
old songs...
meeting under a clock.
Yeah, maybe in movies,
but this is real life.
Real life is fine for people
who can't do any better.
It was fun
killing time with you.
Have fun with the
blue nevus tonight.
Who?
Your skin doctor.
Well, at least he knows
enough not to wind up
in an Egyptian tomb.
Vega!
Okay... here we go.
Francisco!
Thank you for being here.
Is it always like this?
Francisco!
- This is nothing.
- Vega.
- I'm just signing one, thank you.
- I love you!
Francisco!
Vega!
Sorry, we gotta go.
Sorry.
- Francisco!
- All right.
Francisco,
who's the young lady?
- Oh, I'm no one.
- Yeah, what do you do?
Oh, I'm no one really.
I mean... I was Miss Amiability
in Scottsdale,
but, you know...
not really a big deal.
And where'd you guys meet?
Let's go.
Let's go, come on.
Who's the girl?
Come on!
There's no story here.
Come on, Vega!
Come on, Vega!
Thank you for being here.
- One picture, one picture!
- Ciao. Ciao, ciao.
- Oh, please? Come on.
- That's it, that's it!
All right.
Thank you for coming.
There's so much the public
wants to know about you.
Is it true that you were born
on the Orient Express
right outside of Budapest?
Are your two sisters
as beautiful as you are?
And, uh...
please be, be honest.
Don't be modest.
Well, um...
uh... they are.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Um, yeah, they, uh,
they're actually even prettier.
Yeah.
Taylor, especially.
She looks a little bit like your
girlfriend, Tiffany Griffin.
Hm.
Could do worse.
Yeah.
Um... so, umm... tsk,
are you... are you
seriously considering,
uh, making a remake
of "White Heat"?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Me?
Uh... yeah.
I mean, no, sorry.
I should, I sh-,
I shouldn't ask that.
Um, sorry,
I've been drinking and...
it's just that the, the...
the candlelights
are coloring your face in...
quite an amazing way.
I'm, I'm sorry, you have a...
a very effective smile.
You know?
I, I, I couldn't help but ask
if you have a boyfriend...
or not.
Do I have a boyfriend?
- Is that what you're asking?
- Yeah.
Well, um...
yes and...
technically, no.
I mean, there...
there is this boy at Yardley...
who's, um,
I mean...
but he's just a boy,
you know?
He's a mere youth.
Um, we've, uh,
we've dated a few times.
Well... you must be
crazy about him.
Is he... captain
of the football team?
Football? Gatsby?
No! No.
He doesn't play football.
Yeah.
He likes to figure out
the point spread.
Mm, so a mathematician.
Mmm... uh, not ex...
not exactly.
No, Gatsby's, um...
Gatsby's very dear.
He's, uh, he's very...
amusing.
He's unusual, um...
quaint, you know?
That's the word I would use
to describe Gatsby.
Quaint.
He's, uh, he's exotic, eh,
searching, shall,
shall we say, for, um...
this romantic dream
from a vanished age.
Um...
What is this wine?
It's Château Meyney.
Oh.
I shouldn't imbibe
so copiously.
Alcohol plays havoc
on my cerebral neurons.
And how?
Oh, I... I lose my censor.
Yeah, I become...
loose, uninhibited,
passionate, aggressive, um,
wicked... absurd!
I just...
Hello.
Is this where
the poker game is?
- And who are you?
- My name's Gatsby Welles.
Who?
Hey, he's okay.
That's Hunter's brother.
Excuse me.
- I was gonna take Hunter's chair, if that's all right.
- Oh, yeah!
Hunter called and said
you might... sit in.
You sure you want to play
in this game?
Ha-ha, he's all right.
Hunter says he's
a shark, right?
- Yeah... yeah. A shark?
- Better watch out for him.
- More like a guppy.
- Yes.
- But if you guys are worried, uh...
- Oh!
- I got a little somethin' somethin'.
- Oh, this kid's loaded!
Have a seat then,
my friend.
All right.
Sam?
I will call that.
All right.
This is crazy.
Maybe something's
happened to her.
Maybe she's in some
kinda trouble.
Raise, two thousand.
Maybe the story
led her into danger.
Maybe she was kidnapped
or murdered.
Should I call the police?
Of course, then it would be
so embarrassing
if she turned up alive.
Hey, kid.
You gonna call or not?
The bet's two thousand dollars.
Um....
Tsk.
I'll raise you.
And I re-raise you.
All in.
With temperatures
in the sixties.
Rain is predicted
this evening.
It will be heavy at times
and more of it tomorrow.
Mostly cloudy with
a chance of showers
in the late afternoon.
On a brighter note,
Francisco Vega is in town
with his new main squeeze
on his arm.
All our spies could find out
is that she's Ashleigh Enright,
a beauty queen
from Tucson Arizona.
Uh, though they were spotted
later having drinks
over candlelight and...
apparently exchanging
sweet nothings.
I was Miss Amiability
in Scottsdale,
but, you know... not really
a big deal.
- And where'd you guys meet?
- Who's the girl? Come on!
So, good luck, Francisco.
We're all rooting for you.
A gorgeous couple.
As if they need our help.
Ciao. Ciao, ciao.
Jesus, I need a drink.
I need a drink,
I need a cigarette.
What I really need
is a Berlin ballad.
May I get you another?
Yeah, why don't you
make it a double.
You want a double?
It's okay, I won't be
operating any farm machinery.
Hello?
Mom, you gotta give me
a chance.
I said I was gonna
be there tonight.
Ashleigh's fine.
Yes, I'll wear a tie
and I will be there
on time, okay?
I can't really talk right now.
Francisco Vega.
A bullshit actor.
This guy is incapable
of a real moment.
All those mannered gestures
and all that phony
self-promoting liberal politics.
When he offered
to set himself on fire
to protest climate change,
they shoulda let him.
If that's Ashleigh's taste...
the world is full
of beautiful women.
Sorry,
are you talking to me?
Sorry, I was actually
talkin' to myself.
I know the feeling.
You ever see the movie
"Out of the Past"?
Excuse me?
Jane Greer
and Robert Mitchum.
- No.
- She was bad news.
Well, it's the luck
of the draw.
- You alone?
- I am.
Unless you want
some company.
Sure.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Terry Ford.
My name's Gatsby Welles.
What's the matter, Gatsby?
You seem blue.
My girlfriend dumped me
for a movie star.
Ooh.
Well, you know
what they say.
Can't fight charisma.
I didn't want to drink
in my room alone.
Oh, are you staying here?
No, I've been coming here
since they used to only
serve me ginger ales by law.
I love the piano players.
And now I'm old enough
to order gin and vermouth.
Tsk, time flies.
Yeah, unfortunately
it flies coach.
What's that
supposed to mean?
It's not always
a comfortable trip.
Tell me about it.
So, what are you
doin' here all alone?
Working.
Mm, what do you do?
I make dreams come true.
How do you do that?
Use your imagination.
Tsk... ooh, wow.
Shall we go someplace
where we can be more alone?
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah, why not?
Okay.
I get five hundred, sweetie.
Five hundred.
Right.
I know what you're thinking.
Five hundred
seems pretty steep,
but it's New York.
How'd you like to make
five thousand?
- Five thousand?
- Mm-hm.
To do what?
Just to be my date
for a few hours at a party.
Clothes stay on, no fondling,
no exchange of fluids.
Just a little role playing.
What kinda party?
Just my mom's big fall...
bullshit blowout.
I won fifteen G's
in a poker game
and I need a date with me.
Classy item who answers to
the name of Ashleigh Enright.
I hope I'm dressed okay.
- You look beautiful.
- It looks real fancy.
Don't worry,
you're perfect.
Okay.
Now, these things can be
a little boring, all right?
Thank you,
thank you for coming.
- Hey! Vega.
- How are ya? Nice to see you.
- You know Harry.
- Hey, yeah, how are you?
This guy is the best cook.
- You, you have to do one of those paellas again.
- Vega!
- Hi, doll.
- Yeah, hey.
- Mwah!
- Hey.
- Mwah!
- How are you?
I wonder if I can steal you
away for two minutes
- to talk about your fall schedule.
- Now?
I've got a project
with your name on it.
- Yes, now.
- Oh, okay. Okay.
- Do you mind?
- No.
- Just two minutes. Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah? Sure?
- Just this way.
- I'll be fast.
- Hey, how are you?
- Oh. Uh, thank you.
- Oh. You're Gabriella Summers.
- Yes.
- Oh, I have so many questions for you!
- Oh, well.
- You know... for my article, um...
- Okay.
It's not that much further.
It's just at the corner here.
Great.
love to walk.
It's actually the same house
I grew up in.
Oh, so I bet you
went to one of those
fancy schools, huh?
Yeah, I did.
Is it true that
all the kids there
have charge accounts
at Bergdorf's or Prada?
They spend lots of money,
and do lots of drugs and...
blah-dee-blah.
I wouldn't know, I didn't hang
out with most of the kids.
I just liked to watch old movies
and play my vinyl.
That's kinda weird.
Eh.
So, I bet you were
a bookworm.
Not really.
My mother is this...
culture vulture.
According to her,
I must visit this museum,
or I must attend
this piano recital,
or see this opera.
I must read my Henry James,
even if Henry James,
it puts me to sleep,
you know?
- Oh.
- I like Charlie Parker.
Who's that?
Forget it,
that's all right.
God, you really are
in a bad mood.
There you are.
- Excuse me for the interruption.
- You're here.
Yes, I am.
We've been looking
everywhere for you.
I... had to get
my thoughts in order.
Well, I mean, you vanished
off the planet...
Mister Tortured Artist.
Can I speak to you
alone for a minute?
- Yeah.
- Right here.
I mean, I've actually been
dying to talk to you.
Your movie was so much better
than you led me to believe.
- Yes?
- Mm-hm.
Yeah, the climax was,
it was so moving.
It was very vintage
Roland Pollard.
Please.
I was afraid I, um,
wasn't going to see you again.
Oh.
Forgive me, I'm, uh...
I'm a little drunk.
We were very worried
about you.
I spent the day...
thinking,
re-reflecting about my work,
my life.
Uh... uhh,
I want for us to get to know
each other, Ashleigh.
You do?
Would you consider
coming with me
to the South of France?
The where of what?!
Your voice is,
is the only voice that's,
that's, that's had any clarity
for me in ages.
The only voice that
encouraged me where...
where I actually...
believed it.
Oh.
Like a muse.
I... mean, I...
I-I think you've had
too much to drink today.
I know I have!
Come with me.
You can wake up every morning
and smell the orange trees.
I'll talk to you about
my new movie and,
and I can learn from
your unspoiled honesty...
and, and y...
and you, you can...
smell the orange trees.
I, I think you're
c-confusing me with this,
like, total other Ashley.
The L-E-Y spelling.
Hey, I thought that was you!
Oh, Ashleigh. Did...
Hey!
You're here!
I'm here!
Everybody's here.
- Roland's here!
- Oh, yeah.
- I, I, I, I came with him.
- Mm!
I was try... I was trying
to figure out a way
- to contact you.
- Oh.
I have... I apologize
for [chuckling] today.
- Oh, that's okay.
- You were very, very understanding.
- I know, I've...
- Thank you.
- I felt really bad for you.
- No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- Uh, I-I'm, I'm as, I'm about as well as could be expected.
- Yeah.
Well, I mean, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, for a guy that,
you know,
just discovered that, mmm...
- his wife was with his best friend, you know.
- Yeah.
- I mean, you are at a party!
- I'm at a party.
- Yeah.
- I got home, I got to my apartment,
and I was wondering why
Connie's infidelity,
it w-, i-it w-,
it didn't wound me
as deeply as it should...
you know?
A-a-all I could keep,
I-I kept thinking about,
I remembered what you said
about my movies.
And I thought, my God,
why is Ashleigh's...
- approbation so meaningful to me?
- Oh...
It, it really, it was.
And I, i-it struck me.
It struck me.
You and I were thrown together.
We, we, we were tryin'
to f..., w...,
find a wandering rogue
Roland Pollard,
we had an adventure together,
and in the movie version,
in my movie version the guy...
looks up and he realizes he,
he's, he's fallen in love
with the girl.
I've played that role
so many times.
- Writing like this does not come along every day.
- Okay...
- Hi!
- Hey. Hey. Hey, y...
- I'm gonna call Sammy
- Yes, you call Sammy.
- if I don't hear from you by Friday.
- All right. Ciao.
- Ciao.
- I'm sorry it took me so long.
it's so funny.
'Cause my father would
always say, you know,
when drinking
you should never mix
grain and grape together,
but...
nah,
I think they go really good!
Yeah.
Hey, you know what?
I think we should split.
Mm.
We should split?
Gatsby!
If you always intended to come,
you should have told us.
You know I am not fond
of surprises.
Mother... Dad...
this is my girlfriend,
Ashleigh Enright.
Hi, how are you?
How lovely to meet you,
Ashleigh.
You too.
- Hello, it's a pleasure.
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm well, thanks.
- Nice to meet you.
I've done business
with your father.
- Yes, he speaks very highly of you.
- Aha!
Actually, I've never met him.
It's his bank.
Yeah, he's got
so many banks.
So, how are things at Yardley?
Aah, it's very quiet,
you know.
- We get a lotta snow in the winter, that sorta thing.
- Right.
Very rural, but...
I chose it because
they have a great
Kurdish Studies program,
yes, yes...
Have you thought more
about a career?
Your father was
bemoaning the fact
that you were still undecided.
Well, you know,
I have, Leonard and, um...
I want to go into
nuclear physics...
uh, maybe open a little store,
sell dark matter.
Oh, now, Gatsby.
He's kidding you.
No, um, he likes to sit
at the piano and sing.
- And play blackjack.
- Aw.
And when you were a boy,
your mother wanted you
to be a concert pianist.
Mm, ah, yes, well,
she always had big plans for me.
How 'bout you, Ashleigh?
What are your plans?
Well, eh, she wants to be
a journalist, actually.
- T.V. or print?
- T.V.
- Yeah, political stuff. She'll report from all the...
- I'd like to do the weather.
trouble spots.
On the weather.
- Mm-hm.
- Great.
You've been...
staring at Ashleigh all night.
Is there something wrong?
There is something
about that girl.
She's quite pretty.
Mm, sophisticated
for a young girl.
Come on in.
- Wow. Look at this place.
- Nice, isn't it?
What was that all about with...
Ted Davidoff and,
and Rollie Pollard?
We were just talking.
Yeah?
All right.
Well, don't worry.
I'm sure they were
very interested
- in that story you're writing.
- Mm, yeah,
today's been quite a story.
And... that's just the
beginning.
Please... sit down.
Relax.
This is really amazing.
She's very charming.
And hot!
You didn't say
Ashleigh was hot.
I told you she was sexy.
She older than you?
- Huh?
- She looks older.
Hey. Mm.
That's what you want,
a little experience.
You'd better grow up
and get a profession.
You think a girl like that
wants to live hand to mouth?
Funny you should
put it that way.
Keep your hand on the wheel,
Ashleigh.
I mean... God, he obviously
wants to go to bed with you.
I mean, how do you
feel about this?
You have a boyfriend.
Yes, but... I mean,
this is Francisco Vega!
I mean, apart from him
being so sexy, it's...
I mean, he's...
an international icon.
À la Mahatma Gandhi.
How can you say no?
This is a story you can
tell your grandchildren.
May I show you upstairs?
Oh, um... sure.
If you like it here,
you're gonna love it over there.
Okay.
Look.
I got us some whiskey.
Is this where you sleep?
Yeah.
When I sleep.
Look. You, you can see
the whole apartment from here.
- Oh.
- It's quite special.
- It's nice.
- Yeah, I know.
I know.
Oh. Yeah.
Let me help you.
Ho-ho!
Look at you!
Oh, who the hell is that?
Give me a sec.
Yes?
- It's Tiffany. I'm home!
- Oh, Tiff...!
But I thought you two
weren't together anymore.
- Eh, no, we... Oh, no, no, no! Um....
- But you said...
Oh.
Wait a sec.
- Well... well... It's gonna be fine.
- ...you think it's okay?
I mean, you said that you
weren't together anymore.
- Yeah, no, no, but we, yes, we...
- I hope it's okay, I...
Wait, you know what?
You have to hide there.
- But... Oh, okay.
- Go, go behind that door.
Go, go, go.
She can't see you.
Go!
Go, go, go!
Surprise!
Hi!
- What are you doing here?
- We wrapped two days early.
- I'm so glad you're home,
- Oh, really?
- it's starting to pour!
- Yeah.
I just got off the plane.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
I bet you weren't expecting me.
I, I, I, I, I'm loving this,
yeah, but....
Francisco, why are you...
What are you doing
running around?
Just, uh,
getting ready for you!
- Welcome back.
- Ah...
- Hey.
- I just got off the plane.
- Yeah.
- We wrapped two days early!
- Wow!
- I came right from Teterboro.
I know you find being
surprised arousing.
Yeah, yeah. Did...
Ooh...
- Mm, baby.
- Mmm!
- Oh, I missed you, too.
- Yeah, me too.
I missed you, too.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
No, I'm sure
I heard something.
- Cou... Hey.
- One sec.
Hey...
Come back,
that was nothing!
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, do you know which way
the Waldorf Hotel is?
What's on your mind,
Mother?
I want to have
a word with you.
Oh, no.
No, please don't do this
to me tonight, Mom.
I'm not, I'm not
really in the mood
for one of your tête-à-têtes
where I come out on
the short end as always.
I, I really couldn't
take it tonight, okay?
Where's Ashleigh?
I asked her to leave.
What?! Why?!
Don't give me that
Ashleigh bullshit.
I smelled hooker the second
she walked through the door.
Mother,
do you hear yourself?
Damn right I hear myself.
I'm shocked. I, uh...
Okay, I apologize. Um...
tsk,
I met her in the bar
at the Carlyle
and I gave her
five thousand bucks
to pretend she was Ashleigh,
who has dumped me.
Five thousand?!
It was worth that much
for you to make a fool
of your father and me?
I was in a bad mood.
It was my idea of a joke.
So it was a bad joke,
okay?
I won a lot
in a card game, so,
uh, it was an act
of rebellion.
It was an act of hostility.
Hostility and rebellion.
Rebellion against what?
Private schools,
a nice home,
summers in Europe?
Against a life of pretentious
appropriateness.
Appropriate friends,
appropriate schools,
appropriate women that you
may or may not approve of.
Tsk, you resent me
because I set a high bar.
Mother, I don't resent you
because you set a high bar.
I just want you to see me.
I'm never gonna be
like Hunter.
I'm not gonna roll off
the assembly line
and make you proud.
You lied to me when you said
that you were too busy
to come to my party,
that you were too
busy at work,
snowed under at Yardley.
You know what, Mom?
I did lie to you.
Because I didn't want to come
to your party, all right?
I wanted to spend the day
with Ashleigh
in the city...
and have a great time.
- Where is Ashleigh?
- I told you.
She dumped me.
We became separated.
This city has its own agenda.
And your rage with me
is so great
that you express it by
bringing home a whore?
An escort, Mother.
Oh, let's not split
pubic hairs.
Anything to shake up
that collection
of appropriate snobs.
So you, you bring her to my
gala as your girlfriend...
to make a fool of me?
You know what, Mom?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why
I'm like this.
I don't know where I get
this perverse streak
in my system from.
I don't know.
You get it from me.
Oh, yeah,
I get it from you?
Oh, yeah,
the queen of good taste.
All right.
You're a big enough boy
to hear the whole
inappropriate story.
I met your father...
in the exact same
line of work...
an escort service...
or more to the point,
hooking...
as that working girl
you tried to slip past us
as Ashleigh Enright.
What?
Lower your eyebrows.
I knocked on your father's
hotel room door
because that's how
I made my living.
Fresh from Gary, Indiana.
Providing the...
lonely male of the species
with a little casual
recreation.
For a fee.
Except in your father's case,
we fell in love.
And not only did we marry,
Winston used my
hard-earned nest egg
to start the company
that has enabled us to live a,
a pretty privileged life.
You followin'?
Am I goin' too fast?
And I put myself through school
so my brilliant young son
can laugh at my pretensions.
What I'm,
what I'm saying is that...
if I have bent over too far
in my pursuit
of the finer things
and of cultivating an image,
and...
if I have caused you
some discomfort...
it's only an overzealous
ex-professional hustler
from the Midwest
trying to eradicate
unsavory remnants
of many hotel rooms
I still wake up screaming over.
And if you can't understand
where you get your
mysterious urge to consort
with the demimonde...
you have my genes.
And I'm sorry to lay
this X-rated tale
on my sweet college boy,
but something tells me
that the time is right.
Uh, just put up the chairs
and then... you're done.
All right?
Oh, hey, Gatsby.
Hey, Johnny.
I saw you on television.
Well... nothing happened.
I'm really exhausted.
I've been walking forever.
And then I got lost
on the train.
Ashleigh, you were with
a famous movie star.
Well, but nothing happened.
I'd love to believe you.
Just... too many drinks.
Too much weed.
I'm, I'm just a little
too tired to explain. I...
Tomorrow, I promise.
But really, Gatsby,
nothing happened.
Well, then take off
your raincoat, okay?
And I'll get you
some black coffee.
Oh. Oh, I can't.
I have no clothes underneath.
So, to Roland Pollard,
it was...
like a... a spiritual thing.
You know, I was a muse.
Some inspiration,
'cause he's really going through
a rough creative period.
And also, my name's totally
the same as his first wife's...
who also went to Yardley!
Who he's never really
gotten over.
And then Ted Davidoff...
I mean, he was just...
absolutely traumatized
by this affair that his wife
was having with his
best friend.
And there I was,
you know,
just a person there
to talk to, to...
to hold his hand during
a crisis, you know?
What about Francisco Vega?
Uh, James Dean,
minus the acting chops.
Aah, Francisco Vega
was just after my body.
But I was onto him.
And I got terrific material
for a hot story:
- "I Dated a Hunk".
- Hm.
So what about you?
How was going to your
mom's soiree?
It was pretty nice,
actually.
Yeah, we got into sort of
a crazy conversation and...
for the first time
in my life,
she surprised me
in a good way.
And now I feel closer to her.
Mmm, must've been
a big talk.
What'd you discuss?
The oldest profession.
- Journalism?
- Mm-mn.
Ah.
No, that's the second oldest.
Tsk, let's put it this way,
she's a lot more
than I gave her credit for.
I've sold her short.
What a shame we never got
to take that carriage ride.
We can still do it.
Yeah, we have plenty of time...
we can get it in.
Said the john to my mom.
- What?
- Nothing.
Look, we should probably
leave our luggage downstairs.
As you know, I'd hate to miss
our bus back to Yardley.
New York on a misty day.
Can't tell why it means
somethin' to me,
but it means everything.
Hm.
It's my one carriage ride
and the weather's gloomy.
I couldn't really sleep
last night.
You hear all those
fire engines?
I did.
"The roaring traffic's boom...
the silence of my
lonely room...."
I know that!
That's from Shakespeare,
right?
Sir, could you stop
for a second?
- Whoa!
- Why are we stopping?
Ashleigh, you go back
to Yardley. Okay?
- I'm gonna stay in New York.
- What?
I need the carbon monoxide
to survive.
- Well... what are you talking about?
- I don't, I don't know.
We're two different creatures,
right?
Yeah, you like the sound
of crickets
and I like the rattle
of the taxis.
You blossom in the sun and me,
- eh, I come into my own under grey skies.
- Well, yeah...
And look, you were
a big hit here.
You, you were
a crackerjack reporter.
You were loved spiritually,
- emotionally and physically by three gifted men, right?
- Yeah, b...
Yeah-yeah, you don't
want to be with me.
You deserve better than me.
Right, but I, eh...
you're dropping out of Yardley?
Mmmmm...
If I don't sound too
pretentious,
I want to review
my other options.
Excuse me, sir,
do you think it's possible
- to take her to the Pierre Hotel?
- Wait. Wait, I don't...
- Look, you take this, right? Right? You take this...
- Gatsby, I don't understand.
- and you get your luggage,
- I don't really understand.
and then just make your way
safely back to Yardley, okay?
But you're not coming back
to Yardley?
I, I...
I don't know, Ashleigh.
I, I gotta figure some stuff
out in my life.
But look, have a great trip,
and you tell everybody
at, uh, Yardley,
- I said goodbye, all right?
- So you're not coming back to Yardley?
Gatsby.
Um... wait, sir, I'm....
Gatsby,
I don't understand! I...
Um, I...
But we're...
Oh...
Oh, eh... God, um,
could you hurry?
I think it's starting
to rain.
How did I know
you'd be here?
You didn't think I was gonna
blow this moment, did you?
What about the skin doctor?
Very handsome.
Very rich and very clever,
but I'm here.
For a kisser who is a maximum
of an eight?
It's fall.
By spring I'll have you
up to ten.
