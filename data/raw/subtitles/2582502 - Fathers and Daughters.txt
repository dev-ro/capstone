Potato chip!
I'm here.
Here I come! I'm hungry now!
I want my Potato chip!
Guess who's home.
You know I saw the way
you looking at her.
Come on there was a
room full of writers.
--I was just talking.
- Oh come on I know the difference between talking and flirting.
I wasn't flirting.
You shoudn't have had that third glass of wine.
Oh really know listen, once you've been betrayed
 there's no way I would ever...
 once already...
- Once, seven years ago.
- Once?
Once enough for me!
Potato chip!..
Daddy!
Daddy!
The problem
It is that you're suffering from manic depression,
Due to the accident,
to brain trauma
And the loss of your wife.
But, Jake, are the crises that concern me
,
Symptom of something much deeper.
If you not submit to treatment,
You'll find yourself with even more serious disorder.
- Type?
- Psychotic collapses.
I highly recommend you admit to St. Francis.
I know the doctors, I suggest
few weeks of care,
If not even a few months.
A psychiatric hospital?
Let's go!
I can not, I have a daughter to raise.
Exactly!
You have a daughter to raise.
It's still your favorite, right?
Katie...
I have to go away.
What?
Only for a while '.
How?
I do not know, a little '.
I'm coming.
Not this time, honey.
You know...
Accident I'm not very well,
They have to adjust.
I have to be strong to be able to take care of you!
You already are.
Not enough, darling.
You will stay with his uncles
Elizabeth and William
And your cousins, in Westchester.
I do not want you go away!
When I come back,
I will not go away, never.
It'll be fine.
Hello, sweetheart! Jake...
I am so happy you'll be with us!
Say hello to Daddy.
- I have to go.
- No...
I'll be back soon.
You're my Patatina.
Mia and no one else, okay?
I love you so much.
'll Be back soon, honey.
I love you!
Dad!
Let's go.
Please, go!
Jake, now.
I'm proud of you.
If you need, you know where to find us.
Come on, it's time to go away.
Hello, Jake, good luck.
Thanks.
You're in great shape.
You see that ECT gives me.
I hope well that you have fried his brain!
In the head there is the Nobel,
believe me!
If you won Bellow,
I can even win you.
Thank you, in five minutes
I have already stressed.
I kept the commitment,
indeed was a real joy for me,
I saw Katie
least once a month...
You'll see Katie later?
- Yes.
- Nervous?
It's my daughter,
why should I be nervous?
Do you want to come with you?
You are an agent in the round!
I'm your friend.
- We'll manage.
- Yup?
Thank you for coming.
Thanks for the ride.
I recommend!
- Dad!
- Potato chips!
- I missed you!
- You too.
- I told you I was coming.
- The time never passed.
Are you back for good?
But always, always?
Yes.
I love you!
Welcome back.
Thanks.
- I made coffee and treats.
- Do you drink coffee?
- No!
- Thank god!
- But the candy you eat them?
- Yes.
So, let's go!

- Well, as always.
A school is very good,
are proud of her.
- Dottie?
- Lady?
Please
Katie door to his room.
Why?
We catch up with Dad.
Quiet.
Children, not at home!
Go into your room.
What is it?
You've been gone almost a year.
Seven months.
Here, I want to thank both
To be dealt with Katie,
it is in great shape.
I am deeply grateful.
It was surrounded by affection.
Being back will upset you.
- I missed to die.
- Oh yes?
Do you miss Patricia?
Being returned
does not solve that problem.
You know I had to have lunch with her
day of his funeral?
We had to talk about why we had strayed.
Not a day goes by where I do not think.
It was my only sister,
I have never had a chance...
Elizabeth!
Do you make a proposal,
listen to me, please.
Katie is here tonight, so I'll
systems,
Forgive you on track, say,
And in a week or when it will be,
Katie returns home to you.
There's no need.
For us it is not a problem.
- We'll manage.
- It's nice to have you here.
- We like to have you here!
- It's late.
We would like to adopt it.
What?
Damn,
children should not hear us!
What are you talking?
I do not want to hide our intentions...
Katie here is happy, loves and Andrew
Michael, you should see them together...
- Katie is my daughter!
- Sure, but we want them very well.
A year at St. Francis...
you will have dipped into your savings.
You could see it when you want, so you
concentreresti of...
Katie, come on, come on!
Patatina!
We agreed!
He killed my sister, not yours.
- As a 'thank you...
- Thanks.
- Di 'hello.
- Hello.
Honey, I love you!
Katie, wait!
- What happened to you?
- Office.
Incredible,
you are about to graduate in Psychology
You pass the
days listening to whining.
- I like to help people.
- Help me!
I'm just like a dog.
How could I help you, Evan?
I do not know... we could go out together.
- You're sure of yourself, are not you?
- I would say yes.
Tell me, do you really want?
Do you want to go out or do you want to fuck?
Fine by me everything.
What happened to your security?
Can I see you again?
Oh...
Why did you do,
unless you want to see me again?
Today I had not done.
See you.
Hello, Mariah!
- Stay out of trouble?
- I try.
We have a case, just moved.
A 12 year old girl.
Lucy Carter.
The father died of
overdose when she was a baby.
The mother, a prostitute, was murdered by a stranger
a year ago.
- Where do you live?
- It is in foster care.
Do not say a word
from the funeral of his mother.
Do not talk for a year?
- First it was?
- Normal.
- Disorders?
- Anything!
I thought you would be interested.
Yes, very.
Well.
Which do you prefer?
Indicate it.
I like the cat
But I'm me.
I know you're scared.
You're safe here
And are here to help you, believe me.
The...
I do not love.
But you you loved.
A long time ago, once.
So you know to be able to.
In here there is nothing,
Is an empty pit...
Dry, arid.
For this go with so many men?
- No.
- So what are you looking for?
- I do not try anything.
- If you do, you will try anything!
How do you feel?
- Happy?
- No.
- Carina.
- No.
So, how?
It makes me feel...
It makes me feel...
Something,
otherwise I do not feel anything.
And the men
do not like either.
Exactly.
And if I met a man you like?
I do not know.
I would make him regret the day
which has set his sights on me.
Hello, how are you?
- What's your name?
- Katie.
I'm Brian, please.
- Studies here, right?
- Yes.
- What?
- Psychology.
I was playing billiards with a friend
studying Psychology.
I have only done a few lessons, but I like
, it is...
You know?
Do you drink beer? I can offrirtene one?
I'll buy you a... Two beers,
one for me and one for Katie.
You have already drank three beers!
Are you a math genius!
Good one...
Come on, Katie, tell me about yourself.
Well, Brian...
I have strong self-destructive tendencies.
Tim!
Scotch!
Elizabeth knows to be difficult,
no one knows better than I do.
Not two years have passed since he lost his sister,
They were very related.
Tricia hated Elizabeth.
The sisters sometimes they say
things that they do not think.
He said it was despotic, selfish
, moralist.
We are two intelligent people, we go
to the point.
You have rejected our proposal, we will not go back on
,
But today I made you come here...
I called the
school to tell me that you withdraw Katie.
It is a mistake!
It is the best girls' school in the country
!
Do not I can afford it.
Please, for us it is a pleasure,
you do not pay anything.
I promise...
- It is the minimum.
- You've already done enough.
The public school is a jungle,
is this what you want for her?
I will think of something.
There is the public school
and private, and that's that.
Are you okay?
In short...
Do you know how hard it is to find
a place in a private school?
All
wealthy New Yorkers applying,
Taking advantage of their knowledge.
M'inventerò something... I'm buying.
- I do not mean...
- Jake!
My daughter will not grow at the expense of others.
Jake Davis "Fathers and Daughters"
Like?
Child I had a pink bicycle.
Able to ride a bike?
Do your friends have the bike?
If you like, one day
I can teach you to go there.
Let's go to the park,
One of these days.
It would be nice.
How's Lucy? Speaks?
- It's a long path...
- Do not talk.
I will pass the case to the Dott. Ssa Weinberg
She has a lot of experience.
I just need more time.
And I
something to write in your report.
We must not only make an impression on the agency public
There
financing in this period of cuts,
But help a young girl who has suffered so much
not to mention more
And it will have a hard life, unless we go
soon contact her.
We failed, we have to fix.
We have not failed!
You're a very smart girl
And you will become an extraordinary psychologist
But you have to know how to admit defeat and move on
.
Let me take her to the park.
- In a different context...
- not the context, it is the therapist.
You know we can not take them out,
But you still have a week.
Thanks.
I said a week!
Hello!
- How nice to see you again!
- Thanks to receive me.
Imagine, you come.
Know that we regret
really for Patricia.
It was a serious loss for the entire community.
Thanks.
How is Katie?
It's fine.
When she changed schools,
has gone to stay with his aunt and uncle?
- Yes, but he has now come back with me.
- Good!
And I'd love to come back here at
Copen.
We are already half year,
to change school is wise?
I have already withdrawn.
Damn, we'd like to have her back with us
,
But we are full.
There is always room for one more.
I'm sorry!
And as a teacher?
You would be more easily accepted.
Yes, and it breaks...
Lnsegnerò creative writing

With particular attention to the work of the students,

- This, when I take you to school.
I'm working!
Hello?
Hello, I'm Elizabeth.
Hello!
Hello...
I wanted to invite you and Katie to dinner.
Which day do you prefer?
How about Thursday?
No, Thursday
I have a meeting of writers.
Saturday, then? Dottie
makes the meatloaf, Katie loves it.
I would be very happy, but on Saturday we go to the park
And after it will be too tired.
Stop teasing me.
Katie has lived with us for a year,
Children really miss

You mean come over for dinner or not?
I said yes.
Well, then tell me when you get back
best.
I'm writing,

Hello!
I have a present for you.
But you should not have!
I do not think I was all that time in the hospital
To scratch my belly.
"Bitter Tulips"...
I like.
Is it good?
- Never write anything better.
- Really?
I'm sure.
The son of a dog!
I'll I place before the lunch hour.
Well, because...
I'm broke.
I thought it was cute
come away from the office,
Sit here and watch what they do ducks.
In the next life
I would like to come back as a duck.
Flying, swimming...
Squawking.
That would be nice.
He was there and took my hand.
I Kept me by the hand.
- Where did it happen?
- In My office.
But he did not speak.
The step at Dr. Ssa Weinberg.
- I'm almost there!
- Meaning?
- A week, a month, a year?
- We are making progress.
- I'm sorry.
- It's not right!
It is absolutely right!
Tell Lucy that the
meeting on Tuesday will be the last with you,
The end, Dott. Ssa Weinberg
comes to appear.
We ended.
You can replace it?
Thanks.
Lucy, I have spent with you
two fantastic months.
It was very nice to meet you,
Read and play together, draw...
I figured that I said to Carla, a friend of mine
cute,
That I enjoyed a
world and she wants to play with you.
There is coming
can not wait to meet you.
Is to say goodbye
And next time I'll be with you
And not with me.
No.
I want to be with you.
Dad!
Dad!
How are you?
I have great news.
Dad sold the book.
- All right?
- All right? Are you kidding!
It is the best news in the world!
And you can get anywhere on the planet
toy.
I want a pink bike,
with the trash, the bell,
And the ribbons attached to the handlebars.
C'mon, let's get her!
Keep the balance... looks ahead.
So, go very well!
Now alone!
You're going alone!
Brava, looking ahead!
Brava!
Faster!
Brava my baby!
Why suddenly
check a bird
Whenever I near you?
Just like me
She likes to be near you.
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Whenever you're here?
Just like me
They love to be near you.
The angels got together,
the day that you were born
And have decided to realize a dream.
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And gold dust and stars in your blue eyes.
That's why,
all the girls of the city...
What are you writing?
I'm writing a new book.
What's it about?
- Of you.
- Of me?
"I always called Patatina
and can not tell you why."
So, you like?
Why do not you talk to us?
Of us?
You know, little one?
You are a genius!
My daughter is a genius!
Of course I can talk about us...
I do not usually attack button as well,
But it runs a certain item...
What?
What's my favorite writer and your father
Are the same person.
I do not know if it's true.
- They have lied to me?
- Who?
My friends, you are not Patatina?
I do not hear you, we move?
Yes.
What you mean to say?
Jake Davis,
Wrote my favorite book,
"Fathers and Daughters".
It's a famous book.
Yes, I know, I'm in my heart
I was a child.
I have changed my life.
Hello, my name is Cameron.
I Katie.
- Katie?
- Yes.
How Kate Davis?
You are the one Kate Davis?
How much truth is there in the book?
The book is much more fun.
You too
like to go out alone, without friends?
Yes.
Sometimes I prefer...
Be alone, it is easier.
What do you do?
I'm a social worker,
work with disadvantaged children.
I like.
But you what are you doing?
I write articles as a freelance for several newspapers
And I'm writing my first book.
What's it called?
- Do you really want to know?
- Yup!
"Two is the perfect number."
"Two is the perfect number"
... it's a love story?
Yes, we say yes.
- I arrived.
- Do you live here?
- Yes.
- Carina!
Perfect for a potato chip.
You'll never see my house!
I'm not asking
an appointment...
Or more...
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Because?
We could continue this conversation.
I wanted to go for a run.
I also run.
- Want to come with me?
- Yes, I want to.
See you at 4.
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams to you too.
Good night.
"
The moon rises and attracts the young eye.
Rises and shines,
full of grace and hope.
Yes, the tulips are wonderful.
For now.
Everything lives and dies ,
rises and sets,
and loves and leaves...
You can order "bitter Tulips"
downstairs
And Mr. Davis has kindly agreed
To autograph some copies of his previous books.
Kerri, with "K".
With K...
K-and-r-r-i.
Thanks!
A Nancy.
Give me a moment.
Just a moment.
Just a moment.
Permission.
Mr. Davis is fine?
Mr. Davis?
It is so dancing a princess?
Yes, dances just like that,
this is a waltz.
When you grow up,
I'll teach.
If I'm a princess,
one day I will meet a prince?
- Of course!
- When?
I do not know, when the time comes.
How to be called?
It will be called...
Prince-something.
How do I know?
This one says that in ten years
All write to the computer
And to write
machine will go the way of the horse and carriage.
I have here some reviews of "bitter Tulips."
Negative?
"It's so bad that you wonder if Jake
Davis has never been good."
It's terrible.
You have already received negative criticism.
But this is a personal attack.
You...
No, it's...
You have other?
Do not understood it.
"It is so incomprehensible that there was already that
could write it in Aramaic...
or even better not write it at all."
And the Times?
- Who wrote it?
- Colson.
Why do I not want to publicize her story
And he takes revenge.
Knopf wants to halve the run, always
if it sells...
As you say, the promotion?
They also want to cut that.
If you do not support it, it is doomed.
If they do not pay for advertising
If you do not throw,
I can do?
I joke, but they do not
interested, they think only about money.
I'm just reviews.
I do not care of the reviews.
See you later.
An arm, two arms...
Listen...
Unless you want to go to Aunt Elizabeth's birthday,
Nobody forces you.
I know, but I want to go there.
- Really?
- Yes.
We might go elsewhere,
where you want it.
I want to go there!
Really?
I can try to corrupt you?
No!
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry, I heard about the book,
It must be tough being kicked by critics.
Yes...
I do not know why God created
cockroaches and critics,
But he will have had his reasons.
Yes, but they
literally hated!
How did you stand it?
I gave myself a shake,
I picked up the pieces.
I had not even noticed
That trembled.
The last time, it looked
themselves to have a crisis.
Admit it!
It was bad to see you fight against
uncontrollable impulses,
Despite all that time in the hospital.
The book proves it.
You are not ready to throw into the fray
nor a father.
Give Katie,
we can take care of her.
Tell her you love her, but that
may not be a good father.
Do not be a hypocrite...
Use less left.
Really fun.
Now you're in deep shit.
Congratulations.
Daddy, read me a book?
Yes, honey.
Be right.
Shit, shit, shit!
Katie, there's your dad.
Sorry, the train got stuck,
Someone has operated the emergency brake.
You said you put yourself
the alarm when you worked,
I hate it when I stay last.
Patatina?
There's a very angry child, here!
Now we remove the anger,
A layer after the other.
A little 'is gone.
I still see a bit '...
There's more!
I'm a good doctor.
I'll hold.
Now I give you a boost!
Brava my baby!
Want to know why I decided to become a writer,
With all my strength?
When I was in Kenya
One day I woke up, I got off
To piss
and I found myself face to face with a lion.
Really?
Seriously,
a lion, about 4 meters
She is looking at me straight in the eye.
I was saying that I was a goner.
And what did you do?
No, I was petrified,
I could not move.
It remained there a few moments
And then he left, passing
one millimeter from me.
I'll never forget that moment.
It is then that I decided:
No more escape routes
Nothing more documentaries,
nothing more Veterinary
Nothing Harvard.
I would do what I had always dreamed of doing
Namely writing!
I just wanted to write,
Page as if I was writing it were the last.
I wanted to leave something of myself.
I wanted to leave a mark.
Because, sooner or later
In one way or another,
Comes a lion
And it takes us all away.
I'm happy I've spared you.
Yes, me too.
Too.
Come to bed?
In a little '.
I have something for you.
What?
What?
Fathers and daughters
It is the original.
"To Katie, my Patatina,
I love more than anything in the world."
I can not accept it.
I want you to have it.
It's a good luck charm.
It's for you.
Do not take me!
- Do not take me!
- Provo here.
Actually, no, this way!
- I go faster than you.
- Okay, I challenge you.
I did it!
Do not forget to go around.
Another round!
I can not believe my daughter
puts ketchup sull'hotdog.
Do not you like ketchup?
Hamburger, fries on...
Sull'hotdog is ridiculous!
But I do my own thing.
Yes...
You do well.
Happy Birthday!
- Make a wish?
- Yes.
- Happy birthday.
- I love you.
What big teeth!
I bet other dinosaurs
's Turned away,
at dinner.
Do you miss your mom?
Me too.
Do you know that you were her greatest joy
and the love of his life?
And so you are for me.
- I miss him so much.
- Of course.
Of course!
But you know what? Your mom...
It is always with you.
Now it is here, it protects us.
She is watching, and smiles proudly,
Is proud of you, honey!
You see that you are a smart girl
, affectionate
And beautiful.
You'll die too?
Not before long,
I become very old.
How?
Let's say around...
Thousand years?
Perhaps a million,
if I stop eating hotdog.
Dad...
I'll be so old
You'll have a house and a husband,
'll Have a lot of children, a dog and a cat
,
All running around
and to put ketchup everywhere.
Promise.
- I promise.
- Giurin giuretto?
Giurin giuretto.
Jake Davis?
Notified Act.
I was stunned when Bob
exposed me the case,
Never happened that the uncles reclamassero
custody of his niece,
When the biological father is alive and well
And it is also a famous writer!
John Wilton is the best
for credit.
I'm happy to have taken to heart
your case.
Often these causes are aimed more
to hurt than to gain custody.
Meanwhile, talk to William,
convince him to withdraw the request.
If he refuses?
We will ask the judge to store
the case as unfounded.
- And if it does not store?
- The do your ass in the classroom.
Scotch, neat.
I'll start.
I want you to know that it is not a vendetta against you.
We Do not blame for what happened to Patricia
And is not a revenge for having carried off Katie,
After we took care of her for a year
.
Our only thought is the good of Katie.
If I asked you, you would answer
in one breath that wants to be with me.
It has eight years
It is not admissible in court.
But matters.
You're a reasonable man
And you are a father.
You know, in my heart,
are doing the wrong thing.
I admit,
I was angry when I came to take Katie
And you said you wanted to adopt her.
Perhaps...
At the party, I exaggerated.
Perhaps you've gone too?
I am ashamed for what happened at the party.
You provoked me,
but this does not justify my behavior.
And for me...
It would be a pleasure if you and Elizabeth...
Were more present in Katie's life.
I have requested
adoption for the fun.
You know my lawyer, John Wilton.
It's very good.
It's not cheap.
He says you have no hopes,
Never will separate
From the only one biological parent daughter.
You know you'll lose,
why you do it, then?
You spent a year in a psychiatric hospital
Not resolve your crisis.
Dozens of people saw you attack me
To my house,
during a birthday party,
Because I did not like
your book.
You told the police
Connecticut
That when your wife died
've been fighting and you were running.
Although not have you charged with dangerous driving
So that will appear to the court for custody.
Your book is a critical and commercial flop,
We do not know if you will be able to provide for
Katie.
And I have the impression that you do not have a penny.
But we ask to see your bank statements.
I am richer than God!
If we lose, we appeal,
If we lose the appeal,
we appeal again.
You are able to sustain a long
cause?
Are you a good lawyer.
I'm trying to be a good uncle.
No, you're looking
To separate a child,
Which has already suffered immensely
for the loss of his mother,
From her father that she loves
And who he loves her.
Is that what you're trying to do.
I hope to hell
there is a place for people like you.
Can not be really successful!
- No!
- Oh yes.
I have to drink, do you want another?
Yes, thank you.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Well.
- You're beautiful.
- Thanks.
- You do not remember me, do you?
- I think so.
- What's My Name?
John.
We met at Walker's Pub a year ago.
Remember the drinks...
From your house you could see the park.
I live there still.
Let's go.
- Actually I'm with someone.
- Let's go and enjoy ourselves.
You liked it?
Please go away,
he is coming back.
You are a one night stand?
- Is that so?
- Go away, please.
Can I pay.
- Get out.
- You want 100?
- Thanks.
- Thanks a fuck!
- Take it, bitch.
- What happens?
It is a one night stand.
It's your turn, so enjoy it.
I have already given.
Who is it?
I've fucked on the kitchen floor,
I could at least remember my name.
Do you want a hundred bucks?
- Get out.
- Leave me.
Get out!
Get out!
Did you think you have found Patatina
and you find yourself with a whore.
Stop, no!
I am not in love
of Potato Chips, but you.
You.
I found a system to withstand...
My situation and I know that is not healthy.
I know you not good for me.
But...
It helps me to fill this void.
Here, I'm embarrassed enough...
Come here.

Is water, right?
Yes.
These cupcakes are delicious,

I do not know! I do not know, Katie...
What can you say?
You know what? I'm tired.

To try to understand what is
between us, what we are doing!
It's just a story that goes on

It makes me happy!
Look at me when I talk to you.
I'm sorry!

I do not know how.

You tell me.
The archive request was rejected, I'm sorry.
Does not mean that the court has already made an idea
Or who considers that they are right,
But we're going to court.
It was not planned, but have
lot to prove.
Look,
It is a very unusual case,
And instruct it will be a big commitment.
I need

I'll call you.
He realizes that the interest rate on the second loan
Would be higher of 3.75% compared to the first

I went bankrupt in two ways,
Gradually and then all of a sudden.

Writing is all in knowing how to grasp the truth,
If you're not capable of...
We fear that will not be able to repay two loans

Both the house you take it anyway, right?
Come on, we are a bit 'late.
Hello, good day.

Wow!

They serve
money to the lawyer, for food,
For clothes, for school,
to have a roof.
Why are we in the United States of Money!
Art, friendship, love

Only money!
You have a bit 'of money, Patatina?
It's not that you would have $ 60,000 in pig
?
Hey!

You know...
Should change hideout
If you do not want that you feel good.
I do my best, I swear.
I love you.
I love you too.
How do you feel,
when you think about your mom?
We are you and me!
I'm afraid.
Why?
I miss her to death.
I feel...
Angry with her because she's dead?
I love you, Katie.
I love you like I've never loved anyone.
You know, not everyone
those who love you, then they'll leave.
I know here...
But not here.
You have to find a normal girl to love
And not waste time with me.
I like to spend time with you.
- You okay?
- Yes.
- You sure?
- Yup!
I'm going to give me a toilet is flushed.
What's this?

No I want it to end.

- Let go!
Please, listen to me.
I do not know why I did it.
- Please, listen to me.
- No.
Please! Please, look at me.
I do not know why I did it.
Give me a moment,
let me explain.
- I was so scared.
- About what?
Of what have you so scared?
Tell me, what?
About us.
I really try to understand you.
I tried to give you all my love,
But I not take it anymore.
Just.
Enough!
Wait!
What did you think would happen?
- Listen...
- What?
- I do not know how!
- What to do?
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.
Get drunk
Is not a mistake, Katie!
It's over!
It's over, enough!
Enough!
Come home with me and Jeanie.
We have fun,

I like pancakes.

- Arrival.
- Come?
- Go away!
I miss you!
I call a taxi?
Hello.
- What are you doing awake?
- It's morning.
It's morning?
I read a book?
Let's say you read them all?
You wanted to see me?
I have a...
I have great news.
Lucy leaves custody,
was adopted.
Oh!
From a stable and loving family of Queens
,
Already have two children, it is perfect!
In Queens!
It takes an hour to get here by Metro.
Listen...
You can not see her anymore.
What?
It will be followed by a social worker
That will help them integrate into the new community.
Must cut ties with us.
You have done a great job with her,
are proud.
Can not start a new life,
if it is tied to you, is the procedure.
- There will be a way...
- Do not talk to take her to the park!
It's just so, I'm sorry.
It's wonderful news!
That's what we hope to achieve!
We have a lot of things to tell us.
New family,
New school...
It'll be fine.
I promise.
Do not remember much my mom,
But I I loved, loved, loved my father
.
He was a writer,
also quite famous.
It was not very well,
Until...
But he was awake all night,
To finish his latest book.
She was about me,
But spoke in fact of life
And how he has never given up on me.
It was his way...
Tell me how much he loved me
And say goodbye.
That's what the book!
Never ever, we have to give up.
Life is difficult
And unjust
And sometimes it makes you suffer.
You already know what I mean.
We must never give up or quit
look ahead
Although the experiences we have lived
have been difficult.
I can only tell you...
I love you
And say goodbye.
I love you too.
It 'a good girl!
Do you expect a great life.
I will do a good girl, I promise.
- Congratulations!
- Because?
You are about to become a new uncle.
Your brother has a
affair with his secretary.
It's 24!
She is pregnant and want to keep.
Elizabeth filed for divorce.
They withdrew the cause!
"Fathers and Daughters".
How did you write
a novel in three months?
Usually we put years.
Is it good?
I do not know.
You have used the same words with
"The dance is over."
With what?
"The dance is over," the book
that made you win the Pulitzer.
My God!
Do you want to say something to your father?
You're my Patatina.
You and nobody else.
Hello, darling.
Hello.
I miss you.
And I love you.
God how I love you!
I should have told a million times!
I was terrified that you'd let me.
We know they are not easy,
I should know.
You are the best thing that ever happened to me
.
Just can not do it...
I do not want to live without you.
Cameron?
I would go...
It's my friend.
Thanks.
Thank you for everything.
Really.
It is a great honor
Pulitzer
accept the award on behalf of the deceased Jake Davis.
"Fathers and Daughters" has received all possible awards
And was on top of the
Best Seller list for a year,
The dream of every agent!
Do not have offered him a drink
and give him a pat on the back
Instead my nightmare.
Katie, you're the only
who miss more than me.
Thanks.
I had a hard life.
And I think I have made it difficult for others.
I am a mature woman who has never known love.
Is not it amazing?
My parents, they are.
My mother was a woman really miserable!
My father...
We saw him occasionally
Sunday lunch.
You know,
Men
Survive without love.
We women do not.
Come here.
