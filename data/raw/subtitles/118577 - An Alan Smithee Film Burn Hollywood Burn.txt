♪ mr. rin tin tin ♪
♪ mr. rin tin tin ♪
i felt when i read
the first draft
that we had a hit movie,
and that was before
whoopi or jackie or sly
were cast.
my one problem
with the first draft...
was that the character that
became whoopi and the character
that became jackie...
both die, and the character
that becomes sly had
an unredemptive arc.
are you really telling me
i should die?
are you gonna
tell me that, honey?
i'm whoopi goldberg.
i can't die.
huh-uh.
what are you? god?
no. i will not die.
i will absolutely
not die.
i will positively
not die.
no die, no die,
no die.
i'd say redemption is
a subject that i really,
truly believe in.
i believed in it
for john rambo; of course,
redemption for rocky balboa.
i think redemption's
good for the soul,
it's good for box office,
it's good for the country.
it's a cleansing thing.
i mean, it's a definite.
i mean, life without redemption
is like a day without orange
juice. forget about it.
when i heard that whoopi
and jackie and sly
were interested,
i knew the script would need
a little work, and so
we hired six writers...
and then three more,
and then three more.
i knew we were not
compromising the integrity
of the material...
or compromising the integrity
of the writer... writers...
writers have integrity.
i know that.
when i heard that whoopi
and jackie and sly...
had been cast in my script,
i knew the script was history.
i knew i was dead meat.
i also knew
i'd be very rich.
well, i felt that i could
underline the parenthetical...
and irrelevant homoerotic...
aspects of the relationships,
without, of course,
dwelling on it...
in a sexual
kind of context.
i'm a film critic. i know
it doesn't take much
to be a screenwriter.
i got my chance
to prove that on trio.
i took out everything
eszterhaz had put in.
a critic's dream.
the movie is about guns.
he has the...
uh, how shall i put this?
he has a very narrow,
very male definition...
of a gun...
of the use of a gun.
when they first came to me,
i figured they wanted me
to play sly's part...
and jackie's part,
whoopi's part,
but they wanted my words,
not my face.
ah, fuck it.
at the end
they brought me in
for polish.
i was polishing
the script...
that i had
originally written.
i didn't recognize
a word of it.
i put it all together.
we had a fucking home run.
i scissored all the drafts,
i then pasted it together...
ivan reitman and don simpson
taught me that.
selznick used to do it.
we were ready.
i didn't die.
honey, i told him,
"whoopi goldberg doesn't die."
i told him.
i did not die.
i never die.
even if i die,
i will come back
with a reincarnation.
so i never die.
okay?
i was redemptive
enough to shoot it...
because i knew i'd do
my own polish
since i ad-libbed it.
i don't know if that's
hard to follow, but if...
you're an actor-writer-
director-producer-
choreographer-stunt...
kind of guy and worked
on music, you'd follow
that logic.

i was surprised when james
and jerry came to me about
alan directing the picture.
alan was a brilliant cutter,
but he had spent his whole life
in editing rooms,
and this was a very big picture
with a very big budget.
i asked them why they wanted
alan, and even suggested
four other top directors:
dick donner, mel gibson,
stuart baird... mel gibson.
and they said
all the right things.
alan had edited a great many
big-budget action pictures,
and everybody in town knew that
alan badly wanted to direct.
but the real reason james and
jerry wanted alan to do it...
i felt was that they viewed
him as controllable.
they both felt that they could
tell him what to do on the set.
alan's a very sweet man.
he has this tibetan holy rock
that he rubs all the time...
and a tanzanian
fighting stick that
he carries with him everywhere.
there is a spirituality
to alan.
nothing smarmy or anxious,
but just a real gentleness
of spirit.
controllable?
god, no. no.
i don't run the studio
based on who's controllable.
why would i do that?
that's ridiculous.
it's not about control.
it's about art.
it's about
entertaining people.
it's about making
ticket-buyers' lives better
for an hour and 36,
or an hour and 42.
♪♪ they said we'd be mates,
is what they said.
they said i will be the director
and they will be my mates.
that's what the buggers said.
that was before they told me
i'd never work in film again.
that was before james edmonds
threatened to kill me!
well, i killed them,
didn't i? the fiends!
what fiends!
i am absolutely,
one hundred percent,
on-the-record certain...
that james edmonds would never
threaten to kill anyone.
i've known the guy 20 years.
he's a decent and gentle
human being.
even if he did threaten
to kill him...
he was kidding.
he's a great kidder.
you still there?
everybody in this town
knows that james edmonds
has a history of violence.
he was on an mgm flight
coming back from new york...
and he had ordered
a special meal...
a pink's hot dog.
he was still
eating meat then.
the hot dog was burned.
he beat the shit
out of the steward, he beat
the shit out of the chef.
it cost him $5 million.
he stopped eating meat.
no! no! no!
that is completely,
categorically,
officially and unofficially
not true.

as the shit went on,
alan became quieter.
he said everything was fine,
but he was alone.
he reveres his wife
and family, but
they were in england,
and he was living
in that apartment
in santa monica,
going to the set, watching
dailies till late, then going
home to that empty apartment.
his wife and the boys
were in england.
we did try
living in los angeles
for a bit, all of us.
the boys were prepubescent.
they didn't really
take much to los angeles.
well, neither did i,
really.
alan and i felt
they'd be exposed...
to a different world
when we went there, but then...
then we discovered
los angeles to be...
a very homogeneous
society:
whites with the whites,
africans with the africans,
spaniards with the spaniards.
we decided they'd learn
more about life here.
it was
a mutual decision.
i was his
assistant director.
he didn't even say
"wrap." i did.
he didn't hug whoopi or
sly or jackie. i did.
- hiya, lane.
- hey. i'm just sayin',
you know?
i'm a writer.
he respected that.
i am a director,
and he respected that,
and i respected him
for respecting that.

and tight.
we had to change
very little.

on the movie.

was one of our screenwriters.
well, he was the best.
he was the best editor
in the business.
i had very little
assisting to do.
that day he was staring
at this piece of footage,
and he was smiling
and he looked really pleased,
and i was smiling
because he was smiling,
and i said,
"you're really pleased with
yourself, aren't you?"
and he said, "i am indeed.
i have managed to make
a movie that's pure shit."
i don't like guys who hype.
i don't like guys who say,
"this is great."
i like guys who say,
"this is shit."
ah, he was insecure.
most artists are.
he underrated
what he had done.
he was too close to it.
he was blinded artistically.
that's why we had to come in
and make a few... changes,
but what i saw
was great. great!
i mean, what i liked
about alan...
was that he had
this spiritual maturity,
and the artistic talent...
to listen to the suggestions
as they came up.
god, jerry,
you're gonna choke!
right there!
cut it right there.
no. no, no, no!
why are you so insecure?
you can't take
any suggestions.

you talkin' about?

please, james, i beg you.

well, take your name off.
you can use "alan smithee."
i am alan smithee!
yeah, you

he would often
disagree with me,
and then i would
overrule him.
hey! i chew it,
i don't smoke it.
this shit is poison.
are you trying to kill me?
of course he would
disagree.
he has artistic integrity.
it's true that sometimes
when he would disagree,
jerry would threaten
to fire him,
and it's true that alan
did not want to be fired.
this was his first picture as
a director. it would have been
disastrous for his career.
i never threatened
to shitter him.
i threatened to kill him.
but i was kidding.
come on, move over!
no, i'm not a fuckin' bully.
i'm not some sort
of a wise-ass street punk.

i cut it.
oh, yuck!

you all right?
sorry.
call me daddy.
that bloody bastard took it
from me and bloody well
cut it himself!
he gave it to the bloody studio,
and that stupid bloody dwarf
said "thank you."
but i felt that alan
was overreacting.
i tried to tell him
this was his first movie.
what he was describing
was par for the course.
it happens all the time.
never! i've never
interfered with a director.
i mean, i was a director,
so i know how they feel.
interfere with a director?
never.
director's my biggest ally,
and i've saved
a lot of their jobs.
they've saved one or two
of my performances.
put yourself in my place.
let's say...
i think it's like being
on this jumbo jet,
and you're this great pilot,
but you're a passenger,
and the guy flying
the plane is...
he's kind of a hack pilot,
all right?
you're going through
turbulence, the plane
is going down,
and you want to get up there
and grab the controls
and save your life,
but you can't do it
because it's un...
politically uncorrect...
or it's illegal
or there are
union problems,
so we all go down
in flames, okay?
you know what?
this kid is fireproof.
i'm not going down for nobody.
but do i interfere?
yes. no. no. yes.
it all depends what time
it is, you know?
yeah, i do.
so what?
the director is in control
of everyone,
but he's not
in control of me.
as long as he's not
in control of me,
i help the director
be in control.
if somehow
he stupidly thinks
he's in control of me...
i felt something
was very wrong with me.
i-i couldn't concentrate.
i had to stop reading
war and peace.
i walk around
the la brea tar pits,
which i consider
a holy place,
and they suddenly seem
like a vision of hell.
i-i call myrna and the boys
and i'd find myself...
even tibet and tanzania
stopped interesting me.
i love my rock...
and my stick.
usually when he called,
he said everything was fine
with the movie,
but his voice was broken.
i thought for a moment
he was having an affair.
but then i dismissed it.

i was over at evan's house...
when james called and told me
what he wanted from me.
so i called my friend cindy
and we went to le dome
for an early dinner,
and pretended to be
surprised to see them.
we went over to the table
and, you know...
"hi, james." "hey, mishi."
like it was a big surprise.
michelle! you look great.
good to see you.
what a surprise.
and then he introduced us
to alan, and we sat down
with the two of them.
no, i have no recollection
of anybody joining us...
that night that we had
dinner at le dome.
and i did,
i told him he needed
to get laid,
but i was saying that
to him as a friend.
what i meant was,
"fly your wife over here."
that's all.
i'm a good guy.
alan, though...
he's not saying much.
i'm sitting next to him
and he's all tucked into...
his jungle outfit,
holding his stick.
give me that!
no, no.

i don't think we're
quite ready for that yet.
"oh, yes, we are,"
i say to alan, and he laughs.
now he's looking
at my breasts.

he messengered the money

"what do you want to know

i asked james.
james said he wanted...
to look him in the face...
and make him know...
that he knew everything.

to fuck 'em over, to rip out

i promise you that.
by the time edmonds gets
to my house, i'd already
seen it on tv.
the whole fuckin' town's
talkin' about it. poor guy.
any of us could put
terrorism onto the screen,
but when it's for real...
and it hits you right
in the cojones,
it hurts bad.
walks right past me,
sits in his chair
in the projection room,
but there ain't nothing
on the screen.
he's just starin'...

i don't know what to do.
i'm lucky i got the one doctor
that can clear up his sinuses.
that's mishi. send her in.
don't know what happened.

but she's some
hell of a doctor.
i was tired.
my mom and i had been down
to christophe getting
highlights all day,
and then we'd gone down
to bulgari to check out
the diamond crosses,
so i was tired.
and when bob asked me
to go in and check on james,
i didn't feel like it.
but james was just sitting there
in the dark in warren's chair,
and he looked so vulnerable,
like such a victim.
and i was feeling guilty
about sleeping
with alan smithee.
i mean, it wasn't like
sleeping with o.j. or anything,
but still...
alan had stolen a film.
that's not good.
that's bad.
i'd been out with a couple
of gaffers. we had a few.
i got back to my place,
and i guess i was just
about right here.
i saw him. he hit me.
lies!
bloody, fucking lies!
well, it was late at night.
i heard something back here.
it was really dark out.
alan smithee was out there,
waving a stick around
like a madman,
and i fired him on the spot.
we have always been
very selective at taa.
i mean, stallone begged
and pleaded with us.
ballocks! it's ballocks!
i was never there.
i rang him to tell him
i didn't want to release
another terrible movie.
he asked me
if i'd lost my marbles.
"the world will see a million
more awful movies," he said.
"what difference does it make
if one of them is yours?"
then i fired him.
he didn't want to be fired.
he said if i gave the film
back, he could get redford
into my next movie.
i wasn't impressed.
i know taa.
if they really want something,
they use cruise as their bait,
not redford.
still, redford is one step up
from hoffman.
let's go, let's go!
got 'em. come on!
all right. now we had
two incidents
that were very scary.
first, he beat up the ad.
he got our attention.
we took very good care of him.
then, he threatened
his own agent.
i mean, you don't threaten
agents in this town.
it works the other way,
you know?
i mean, this guy was
a few fries short of
a jumbo meal, you know?
oh, it's... that's... what do
you call it? a penalty...
a foul.
"amok." that was
the word they used.
that was the word
the murdoch papers used.
they asked me, "why has
your husband run amok?"
as if it was my fault,
making their tabloid
inferences and innuendos
in their murdoch way.
i got very angry
with alan then.
i thought, why are you trying
to spoil my simple life?
it's only a bloody movie.
bad shit! bad shit!
it was top of the national news.
it was banner-fucking-headlines.
p.t. barnum couldn't have
done it any better.
merrick couldn't have
done it any better.
jon peters couldn't have
done it any better.
i couldn't do it any better.
all we needed was
to get the damn film back.
on the line is the director
of trio, alan smithee.
can you hear me?
kiss my bum, larry!
we can hear you just fine.
pucker up.
are you puckered up?
yes.
what can you tell me about
why you are doing this,
mr. smithee?
you stupid fucker.
why?
yes, why?
burn, hollywood, burn!
burn, hollywood, burn!
you're gonna burn
trio? why?
i must.
o.j. did it,
didn't he, larry?
you must?
why must you?
are you daft?
you know he did it.
didn't whoopi
work in the part?
yes, but ted danson ruined her.
was it jackie chan then?
no, no, no. he doesn't
speak any english.
then it's stallone?
no, he's finally
out of the closet.
then what is wrong?
michael ovitz is gone,
that's what's wrong.
you mean,
you're afraid it won't be
commercially successful.
you're afraid
of your career.
i'm at the top, you schumck!
you kiss everybody else's butt.
why aren't you kissing mine?
you're at the pinnacle
of your career, and you're
gonna burn your own film.
i saw you kiss marlon brando.
why did you kiss marlon brando?
he was calling into
the tv shows.
he had his face all over
the front pages.
this guy was more popular
on the rush limbaugh
circuit...
than heidi fleiss
and hugh grant had been.
he was badmouthing
the movie, though.
i mean, that's always...
scary.
ahh! mommy!
mommy! mommy!
alan was everywhere.
everywhere.
he did what bob tried to do
when he wrote his book:
be everywhere.
i'd been with some names,
but i realize...
jack, warren, even henry...
alan was everywhere.
he was turning
into the biggest name
i'd ever been with everywhere.
i'm not a star-fucker.
from what we now know,
he was living mostly in his car
and driving around.
he was eating bologna sandwiches
and driving up and down the 405.
i don't know why nobody
pulled him over.
we had his license
plate number. it was
a black range rover, though.
half the west side
drives that car.
well, we had to do
something.
l.a.p.d. wasn't getting
anywhere. rizzo wasn't
getting anywhere.
it was my idea to go out
and try and communicate
with smithee.
i'm a communicator.
i said to james,
"you got a presence,
a solidity, a persona.
go on tv.
try to talk to smithee."
you know, time was running out.
the exhibitors were going crazy
wondering if they were ever
gonna get their picture...
pussy.
james edmonds, the producer
of the movie trio,
is with us live tonight
with this dramatic appeal.
james?
thank you,
mario.
alan, we know
you're out there,
and we know that
you're in pain.
we were a family
all through the shoot,
and we're a family still,
and when you needed
our advice during the shoot,
we were there,
and our sole intent was
to make a great movie.
well, you did that,
alan, and we're proud
of you for it.
please call us.
please.
the world deserves
to see what your...
your genius has created.
it's only human to be
displeased with something
that we've done, but don't...
don't do an injustice
to yourself, alan.
we love you, and we're
praying for you.
thank you
very much.
later tonight on action 3 news,
the pit bull they couldn't kill,
and another severed penis
found on the sony lot
in culver city.
how'd it go?
fucking
sensational.
james, is this movie
really a piece of shit?
it's fucking
sensational.
thanks
for coming.
i work at the big shell station
right over there
in south central.
range rover pulls in.
dude gets out, pumps some gas.
it was the dude, man.
it was the dude!
hey. you gonna
burn it?
oh, yes. absolutely.
i have no choice.
you know they're gonna
kick that pink, white,
khaki ass of yours, right?
yes, absolutely.
they'll have no choice.
let me ask you.
you still got
that stick, dude?
yeah. it's african.
it protects me.
wanna see it?
it's in the vehicle.
it's lovely, isn't it?
it's cool.
nice.
yeah.
would you like it?
here, take it.
no, man.
it's your stick.
yeah.
- i'm not really african.
- around here you're gonna
need this.
well, i still have
my holy rock.
- come on, dude. man, let's
go get some ribs, huh?
- yeah.
so when he was done, i tell him,
"you the luckiest white boy
that'd ever die."
he said, "oh, no, not me.
i fucked myself."
i said, "nah, man.
you comin' with me.
we gonna hide you out."
he said, "you not gonna
take my film cans, is you?"
i said, "nah, man.
i can dig. i'm... "
"an actor," he says.
i look at him and realize,
well, certainly he is.
this is los angeles.
everyone's an actor.
so i tell him about
the family.
the african american
guerilla film family.
we can dig that.
art. integrity versus
the system. the studios.
baby back ribs
with hot sauce. mmm.
black-eyed peas
and collard greens.
i had no idea
he was forming a terrorist
alliance with the schvartzes...
uh, african americans. hi.
of course, it would not
have mattered one whit
had we known what he was doing.
you know, i don't know
if i'd mentioned this.
harry belafonte is actually...
a very good friend
of mine and, uh, spike...
lee?
lee, yes, once invited my wife
and i to a knicks game...
and at the last second
he couldn't make it, but he
gave us the tickets, you know?
what's his name? what's his
name? when he... uh, mandela.
nelson.
nelson.
i'm the one who set up
the reception for him.
i used someone's in the kitchen
and wolfgang puck.
for nelson. it was fabulous.
please tell me
that this is
caviar house beluga.
nope. it's petrossian.
i can't believe it.
go get her.
honey?
fine.
you do have
the wide-angle lens for this?
when we found out afterwards
where he had been, i wasn't
the least bit surprised.
i think that whole telluride
crowd is subversive.
rizzo found out afterwards that
many of the african americans
who had been with smithee...
had also been
up at telluride.
one of them had
even been to venice.
venice? jesus.
bunch of communists in venice.
i've never been to telluride.
i ski in aspen.
one year we couldn't get in,
and we had to go to vail.
disgusting.
vail? that's worse
than telluride.
i told you
we couldn't get in.
that's the only reason
i went.
what do you mean,
you couldn't get in? you?
you didn't
flush.
no, i never
flush myself.
bulgari, here i come.
mr. edmonds.
alan smith.
excuse me?
alan smith.
from the national enquirer.
s-m-i-t-h.
ah. ah. ah.
you're the guys who did
that story on ryan o'neal.
we sure did.
did he sue you?
he sure didn't.
alan smith. s-m-i-t-h.
he should have sued you.
i think
i actually hit him.
so anyhow, i called
the family together.
smithee sat with stagger lee
while we were waiting.
stagger put
the third man on.
smithee started analyzing
the cuttin' scene by scene,
so stagger started
taking notes.
so i asked him,
"you like spike?"
he goes, "oh, yes, indeed."
"do you like john singleton?"
"oh, yes, indeed."
"you like carl franklin?"
"oh, yes, indeed."
"you like
the brothers brothers?"
"yeah."
"the brothers brothers.
the ultimate street
filmmakers in history?
you ain't no brother and
word up bitch?"
he goes,
"i am in awe. in awe."
i have the greatest respect
for african american filmmakers.
they are the cutting edge,
they are the driving force,
of american film.
i was personally and deeply
devastated and decimated...
when carl franklin left us
last year for universal,
just like most of our talent
left us last year
for universal.
i love carl's movies,
though.
jungle fever...
that's my favorite.
sister ii lumumba
called me up,
and she said he was cool
and we need to help
the motherfucker out.
and i say, "yeah?
you know, straight up?
get that motherfucker
a straightjacket and
wear it the fuck up first."
yo, leon called, dude.
they got the motherfucker
at the family.
i say, "what they got
the motherfucker there fo'?
they takin' hostages now?"
i understood we were
waiting for something,
but i didn't know what.
there was a palpable
expectation in the room.
they put a brothers brothers
movie on the telly...
you ain't no brother.
i love that movie.
it could have been cut
a little tighter.
yo. we walk in,
and it's mad late,
and smithee's over there
on the couch, watching
you ain't no brother.
he got the cans of film
on the side.
so we walk in, and he looks.
and you know what?
motherfucker got whiter.
sister ii lumumba, she say
we the brothers brothers.
now, he one pale white,
film-robbin', terrorist
son-of-a-bitch.
smithee say, "it's a great
pleasure to meet you.
i'd never met any cossack
filmmakers before."
yeah, and i was down
with that.
i was down with that.
yo, and my momma's cossack.
and my momma's cossack too.
don't! don't, okay?
don't!
don't ask me about
the brothers brothers, okay?
not one word.
i don't know
the brothers brothers.
i don't know any cossacks
or half cossacks.
bob doesn't know any cossacks
or half cossacks who come
over to the house,
although i'm sure
warren knows them.
it was funny what was
happening to me.
i was thinking
about smithee all the time.
thinking about him,
thinking about him.
it was like...
i'd been touched
by the holy spirit.
jack, warren, henry
touched me a lot.
no holy spirit.
see, he was mo'
cossack than us.
he was mo' roots
than us.
that's right.
nobody else in the family
was cossack,
except for me, dion,
and smithee,
he was honorary.
you know what?
he was a cool
motherfucker, man.
you know what?
he was a fly
motherfucker, man.
ah-ha.

and by then,
he knew that smithee
wasn't there.
i jumped out
the bedroom window,
you see?
i had the film cans
in me hand,
and i had my stick,
and i ran down the back stairs
and out through the yard,
and i came out the bushes,
well, about a block away,
and i saw my range rover
parked there.
we'd had to park it further away
the night before 'cause
all the spaces were taken.

made me think
about my life.
thinkin' about
my life...
made me think about
the la brea tar pits.
don't know why.
you'd have thought they'd have
staked out the tar pits.
we did stake out the tar pits
for the first 24 hours.
when there was no activity,
those shmucks...
in business affairs
didn't approve the overtime.
i drove down
to the tar pits.
parked in the lot.
i sat there.
i opened the cans,
and i sprinkled
the lighter fluid
i bought at ralphs.
i looked
at the film.
i could see
myself in it.
i struck the match...
i dropped it
into the film.
guess who?
he was worse than
the unabomber,
roberto alomar
and bob dole combined.
he was bogdanovich
and cimino.
he was cliff robertson
and mark fuhrman.
he was half cossack.
he was
damn near black.
- he was o.j.
- he was torn.
he even thought about
giving himself up.
by then, it was all over
the television.
believe me,
i had never thought...
of getting
involved in another
high-profile case again.
wh-wh-what did i do
when i heard
he burned the film?
i came down here
to the beach.
i sat down on this ro...
it was the best picture
i had ever produced.
it would have been one
of the biggest films
in... in movie history.
it's impossible
to express to you...
how i felt.
impossible.
i heard james talking
to jerry glover on the phone.
he said, "we can spin
this, jerry.
"it's better
than if it would
have been released.
"fuck the studio.
we can promote this...
into the biggest success
you and i will ever have."
smithee was grief-stricken
when i saw him.
nearly comatose.
he told me everything.
how he had been abused
on the set. manhandled.
how edmonds had threatened
to kill him.
bob! bob!
how the studio
had threatened
to ruin his career.
how his movie had been
completely re-cut after he,
being one of the greatest
editors in the world,
had cut it.
yo, bob!
i completely understood.
alan smithee was a man
who h... was willing to make
the ultimate decision:
yo, bob!
you know he did it!
he saved what he had not
been allowed to create.
he had to save himself
by killing it.
he was a hero.
you-you-you burned
your own film.
i-it was my child,
but it wasn't my child.
you have the right, the
right to kill a child, even
if it isn't your child?
♪♪ no.
- but you did.
- but you see, i didn't kill it.
you didn't.
what did you do?
i brought it back to life.
they killed it.
i ended its suffering.
i-i ended the suffering
of others who would have
had to watch it.
this was then a, uh,
humanitarian gesture?
please god it was.
i tried to sign him back
after the king show,
but, uh, he wouldn't
take my calls.
he was on the cover
of slime and newsleak,
he was abc's
person of the week...
you win some,
you lose some.
ah, what the hell.
i'm close to signing
stallone. we think
he's comin' back.
i had a great idea,
but tokyo overruled me.
so we didn't have
the movie. so what?
we had the trailer.
we had a 30-second trailer!
i was gonna open
the trailer in the theaters,
charge the usual ticket!
doesn't matter how long
it takes you to come,
it's how much you tingle.
tokyo.
it's conservative.
i worked out a deal
for him with the studio
and the d.a.'s office.
garcetti didn't want
to prosecute this one anyway.
hi.
there
were alan smithee fan clubs
forming across the country.
on every campus.
hi, bob.
how are you?
he agreed to put smithee
into a psychiatric...
clinic in england.
good evening, victor.
a psychiatric clinic?
a deal? no trial?
there wasn't gonna
be a trial?

i thought...
i don't even want to

was talkin' about him.
alan smithee was a gold mine.
if there's one thing i have
learned in this business,
it's stay on your feet. i've

in here, and said
they wanted to buy
the rights to me.
i said, "who?"

mr. smithee!
bloody lunatic!
alan collapsed.
we had to take him
to hospital.

he'd suffered one of those
slight heart attacks.

alan?
you gotta think about me
and the boys for once
in your life, alan.

no one will ever allow you
to direct again, alan.
no one. never.

that's right, he want
us to direct his life.

deal closed, baby.
smithee's wife called
to tie up the deal.
she was his agent now.
she said smithee
was insisting that...
the brothers brothers direct
the story of his life.
well, that's fine with me.
i've always wanted to work
with the brothers brothers.
uh... hey, dudes. you wanna
go hang out in south central?
yeah, i hear you.
but not this time, bud.
you know why?
'cause i called james edmonds.
right, and i called
jerry glover.
and we say, "we direct the movie
if we get final cut."
- i said, "no way."
- i said, "i've got final cut."
yo, i told 'em they could
kiss my black ass.
yeah, and i told 'em
they could kiss
my black ass too.
the brothers brothers?
i'd be happy...
to give them final cut

to worry about evans.
forget about him.
he should have
left me out of his book.
he hasn't got $3 million.
he hasn't got $1 million.

these west coast guys,
they got no moxie.
edmonds should
know better.
i don't bluff.
i never bluff.
i didn't have a choice.
i couldn't take the chance
that evans was bluffing.
tokyo wanted this...
james was gonna have
to give up final cut.
the brothers brothers
would have it.
anything!
anything he wanted
to direct, i would produce.
i believe in closure,
i be... i believe in healing.
and i'll tell you
something else.
i'd give him final cut.
cool!
if alan smithee wanted
to direct another film
himself sometime,
i would hire him
in a heartbeat.
he has demonstrated
his integrity,
and the possessory credit on the
movie, "an alan smithee film,"
