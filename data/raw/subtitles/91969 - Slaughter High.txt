Contestants and spectators
are reminded that the track meet
will begin in 15 minutes.
Contestants should be
preparing and suiting up
in the locker room number 4.
Spectators are invited to proceed
to the track and field area.
Come on.
Come on, you want to do it, don't you?
Are you kidding? Sure, I do.
You know Marty. Game for anything.
You have done it before, haven't you?
What do you think you got here?
Some little virgin?
Me, I'm a sex machine.
She's got him hooked. It's working.
All right. Let's go!
I can't go in there.
Sure, you can.
The track meet's just starting.
Who's gonna see us?
Some other time.
Oh, come on, now.
Lover boy's not frightened, is he?
What would all the guys think?
It's not that, Carol.
It's just I don't want you
to get into trouble.
Oh, come on.
Come on. Come on, that's it.
Come on.
You get undressed in there.
What about you, Carol?
Where are you...
Where am I what?
Where are you gonna un...
No, listen.
Nobody's gonna hear about this
from me, you know.
That doesn't mean...
I mean, if you want
to tell some of your friends,
that's fine by me.
Don't worry, they'll find out
all about Marty Rantzen.
Now, get in there!
You got it.
- By the way, just one thing.
- What's that?
You won't forget to take your hands
out of your pockets?
Quiet now.
Quick, get in there!
Oh, my God. Don't panic. Keep calm.
Hi, Susan.
Are you coming to the meet?
Oh, no. Those sports jocks bore me.
But Frank's throwing the javelin.
Aren't you gonna watch it?
Do me a favor, will you?
Okay, no big deal.
I'll be seeing you.
Bye.
Hey, what's going on?
Ever tried it under the shower before?
You know, Carol,
this is an experience
I'm never gonna forget.
You won't.
How do you want it? Hot or cold?
In what?
The shower.
Come on, how'd you have it last time?
How does lukewarm grab ya?
You kids.
God damn it!
What's the matter?
I can't undo the fastener on my bra.
You want me to help?
Oh, no.
No, it's okay.
Hurry up, sex machine.
I'm wet all over.
Thank you, God.
You know, Carol,
this is the best birthday
I've ever had.
April 1st is your birthday?
That's right.
Are you ready?
Just about.
Here's Marty!
April fools!
Where's the beef?
Where's the beef?
April fools!
Hi, you're on Candid Camera.
Hey, Coach.
They be fooling about
in the girls' locker room.
Yeah, so what else is new?
Man, they got a lot of guys
in there with them.
Guys?
- Yeah.
- Boys?
Shove that sucker's head down.
Yeah!
What the hell's going on in here?
Just having a little fun, Coach.
Which one of you heroes
thought that this was gonna be fun?
We kind of decided together.
A team decision?
Hey, what have we here?
Come here.
It's the joker.
And team captain Skippy Pollack.
Well, you can tell the rest of the team
that you've just been drafted.
I want everybody in the gym,
3:45, suited up, ready to go,
and we're gonna find out
what fun really is.
By the way, Rantzen,
what are you doing
in the girls' locker room
in a state of undress?
I kind of got lost, Coach.
Yeah, well, you better get lost right now.
Come on.
3:45, in the gym.
And that goes for you, too, Stella.
That stupid dork Marty.
It's all his fucking fault.
All right, all right!
Cut the trained monkey act.
Come on, line up.
I want a lineup right here.
Come on.
Shape up, come on!
So this is the gang, huh?
How long has this motley crew
been in existence, huh?
Can anybody tell me?
Come on, come on.
What do you have to do
to become a member
of this elite hit squad?
Be tough?
Are you tough, Frank?
- No, Coach.
- "No, Coach."
Am I tough?
- Yep.
- Yes...
- Yes, Coach.
- "Yes, Coach." Good.
The joker.
Make me laugh.
Make me laugh, Skip.
Come on, make us all laugh.
Or maybe you just have to be pretty.
Or stupid?
Now where the hell
are Harrison and Putney?
Hey, lay off, guys!
Hey, Marty.
We just wanted to say...
Well, what I mean is...
Look, we're sorry about
what happened back there.
We were just messing around.
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.
Things kind of got out of hand.
Yeah, well, next time
I'm about to score, cool it, will ya?
I mean, Carol really has
the hots for me, you know?
- She does?
- Sure, she does.
She lives just down the block
from you, doesn't she?
So you'll get another chance.
Anyway, just to show you
there's no hard feelings,
try this joint.
It's really good stuff, man.
Yeah, I rolled the joint
with my own fair hands.
Listen, we've gotta get back
to detention for being bad boys.
Guess you'll be staying late
in chemistry again tonight, huh?
Yeah, I have to go make up
some 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene.
Good luck, man.
Be seeing you!
Bye!
Just wait until he tries that dope.
All right, keep your butts down,
your backs straight.
Let's see some movement!
Come on!
One! Two! One! Two!
That's very good, Joey.
And then, after that, we're gonna learn
three, four, five, and six.
Congratulations, Skippy.
You're almost making me laugh.
Very nice. Keep trying, sweetheart.
Come on, come on!
Who told you to stop?
Let's see something here!
Stop daydreaming, you sex fiend.
Harrison, Putney!
Where the hell have you guys been?
Sorry we're late, Coach.
I guess we must have forgot the time.
Yeah, well, get down
there and give me 20.
- 20?
- 40!
Which arm?
Your right one, wise guy.
You're now on 60.
You want to try for 120?
Hey, Coach!
Somebody threw a brick
through the window!
I could have been scarred for life!
Will you cut out the dramatics?
Go find out who did this.
Yes, sir. Right away, Coach.
Come on, get a move on, Pollack!
Hey, come on, the rest of you.
What is this, National
Sit On Your Duff Week?
And keep your elbows in
at your sides, Shirl.
That's it. Breathe out as you curl up.
Now, breathe in as you let it down.
Keep it in... Don't move the elbows.
Keep them in...
- Pollack!
- Yeah?
Don't "yeah" me.
Yeah, Coach?
Did you catch the guy that did it?
By the time I got there,
I was so tired, Coach, I lost him.
Sorry.
That is pa... pathetic, Pollack.
I'm sorry, Marty. We didn't mean to.
Hello?
That you, Carol?
Hi, Manny.
What do you want now?
Carol, baby, I just called you
to say good morning
and have a good day, you know.
Yeah, well, you have a good day, too.
Now what do you want?
You know what I want.
Are you gonna do this picture or not?
I've got to know, because the guy
wants an answer this afternoon.
- I'm not doing it.
- You're not?
Tell me why the hell not!
What about my percentage?
Look, Manny.
The guy's weird,
the story's weird, and...
- And what?
- And you're weird.
Listen to me.
You take your clothes off
for the photographers
every day of the week.
What's the difference?
The difference is that guy
should be locked up.
He has been.
Now listen, kid. It's a big break for you.
"Break"? Do me a favor.
Don't give me any more
breaks like this one.
Hey, baby. Be nice to me.
Who's a pretty boy, then?
Who's a pretty what?
Who's a pretty boy?
Hey, I take it all back.
You'll go far in this business.
I was talking to the dog, Manny.
I'm not doing that picture.
You know how many big names
started off this way?
I could tell you.
Hundreds, thousands already.
I said forget it, Manny.
You know what?
I'd rather go
to my crummy class reunion
than do that picture.
And that's final.
Why, you ungrateful bitch.
Hey! Don't do that!
You almost frightened me to death!
- Where have you been all night?
- With Ricky.
Yeah? I was worried about you.
Guess what.
What?
We're engaged!
Wow!
That's fantastic.
Is that the ring?
God, it's so beautiful.
I've got to meet Ricky's parents tonight.
I thought you were gonna
make it to the reunion.
Damn, I forgot all about it.
But, hey, listen.
They're only in town
for a couple of hours.
- I'll get away early.
- We'll see.
No, I'll make it! Whatever.
Maybe a little late, but I'll make it, okay?
Okay.
It should be fun.
Besides, what have we got to lose?
D.O.D., Radio Doddsville.
Radio Doddsville. All right.
- Doddsville High, here I come.
- But first, the bad news.
Local weather conditions
are going to be changeable,
so it seems like it's going to be
a cold and wet vacation weekend,
and maybe some sleet
and thunderstorms.
Aw, shit.
The good news, Radio Doddsville
will be with you all the way.
And April Fool's Day is on its way, too,
so here's your favorite, Barry Manilow.
Barry fucking Manilow?
You gotta be kidding me.
Taxi, lady?
Skip!
It's great to see you!
Hey, easy, baby.
I got my image to think about.
Your image? In this crate?
Boy, I'm glad you came by.
I thought I was gonna have to walk
all the way from the 7-Eleven back there.
Well, you're lucky I decided
to take the scenic route.
Yeah. Silly me decides to hitch it.
You know, see America the beautiful?
So, this thing gonna get us there?
Don't you worry.
Old Skip and his faithful warhorse
will get you there without a hitch.
Oh, shit!
Where'd you get this old jalopy, anyway?
Do not insult Doris.
She's very sensitive.
I guess the rubber band finally broke.
Oh, shit!
Fuck you, asshole!
Why don't you get this
heap of shit off the road?
Joey!
Skip. It's great to see you, man.
- How you doing, Joe?
- Yeah!
Put her there, pal!
Yes! Stella!
So you finally went and made
and honest woman of her,
huh, Bone-crusher?
Yeah, you gotta call me
"Mrs. Bone-crusher" these days.
Was that Carol?
Who else?
Miss "Most Likely to Succeed"
has finally made it.
Looks like you got
a problem here, old buddy.
Yeah. Think you can fix it?
No sweat.
That one's on me, Hanson.
Carol, Ted! Great to see you!
Kissy, kissy, Shirl!
Carl. Where you been keeping yourself?
Law school. What you been up to?
You know, this and that.
Hey, but shouldn't we be inside?
Class is about to begin.
The door's locked.
It can't be. We got the right date.
Try for yourself.
Are we the only ones?
Looks that way.
Can't see shit inside.
This place is the pits, man.
Yeah, nothing changes.
For Christ's sakes, Frank.
What are you trying to do, kill us?
Oh, man. That bike has got to go.
You're past it, Frank.
Over the hill.
"Over the hill"? Bullshit.
Frank, are you okay?
Sure, Stella.
How you been keeping, big boy?
Hey, whoa, there.
Let me breathe.
Who's got the beers?
Same old Frankie.
Where the hell is everybody?
This someone's idea of a cute joke?
Hey, don't look at me.
I don't know who sent out the invitations.
Well, is anybody else coming?
It's not gonna be much of a party.
I vote we go back to town
and swap a few stories.
No way, man.
I'm going inside.
Who's coming with me?
Hey, I will.
Joe! I am freezing my butt off!
I won't be long, honey, okay?
Come on, Joe.
We'll go around the back way.
We'll find a way in.
It's a waste of time.
Carol, lighten up.
It'll be fun!
Oh, sure.
There's a window over there.
Yeah. Let's take a look.
Aw, shit!
What?
Dog shit.
Shut up.
Hey, Skip, did you hear something?
Where?
Over there, in the bushes.
No. It was nothing.
Come on.
I sure heard something.
Give me a boost.
All right. Ready?
One, two, three. Hike.
Yeah.
Try that top window.
Cheer up, girls.
There's some extra beer left.
Do me a favor, Ted.
I'm gonna go back
to town and call Susan.
I'll join ya, darling.
Sounds like they got in.
They'll never get in.
That whole place is locked up.
Shit.
Looks like rain.
Joe!
Are you in there?
You jerk!
Who'd you think I was?
Jason?
April Fools!
April Fools doesn't start
until midnight, smart-ass.
Hey, someone's been
fucking around in here.
It looks like we've been set up.
Or it's Skip's weird idea of a joke.
Come on, you guys.
I had nothing to do with it.
Cobwebs.
You gotta be kidding.
You're sick, man.
For Christ's sakes.
Okay, I did it.
I set this whole thing up
just to waste your time.
Satisfied?
Come on, I'm leaving.
I'm with you, Carol.
Yeah, this place gives me the creeps.
Let's go find our old classrooms.
Should be fun.
Yeah, there's a good idea.
We'll wait for the storm to go by.
Aw, what the hell?
Yeah, why not?
Jesus, looks like Halloween.
Hey, Skip, this is really great.
Yeah, you should be shot and put away.
I'm only staying five minutes.
Somebody turn the lights on!
Holy shit.
This is weird.
Reminds me of prom night,
doesn't it, Joe?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Just before I passed out.
It's spooky.
Hey, we got food
and drink and everything.
Must have set you back a fortune, Skip.
Yeah, well, you know, I do try.
Come on, you guys. Let's party!
Hey, aren't those our lockers?
Somebody must have moved them in here.
And there's my name scratched on it.
I got my ass kicked for that.
Look, my gloves.
I'd lost them on prom night.
That's not the only thing she lost.
My calculator.
That went missing, too.
And you only just noticed it?
What the hell are these doing here?
- They yours?
- They were.
Still smell the same.
- There you go, Skip.
- Oh, man.
You were always borrowing them
from me, anyway.
This time, you can keep them.
You sure you didn't have
anything to do with this?
This your idea of a joke?
Cut it out, Carol.
Hey, isn't that Marty's locker?
Marty.
You think we should take a look inside?
You want to?
No way.
I'll do it.
Now, look, I had nothing to do with that.
Marty's yearbook.
Oh, God.
Open it.
Guess the little sucker never got it.
Boy, would you look at Joey?
He never collected that prize, did he?
No, they took him straight to the hospital.
He had six months of plastic surgery.
- Did he recover?
- No.
Not all the skin grafts took.
When they finished with him,
he still looked a real mess.
Not that it mattered much, anyhow.
The doctor said he'd never
be fit for human company again.
His mind went berserk.
He flipped out real bad.
No shit?
Yeah.
Don't you realize that we...
we turned him from a nice little guy
into a crazed lunatic?
And you know what?
They say he still roams the nuthouse,
ever hopeful of that chance to escape,
escape back to his old school
so he can take
his evil revenge out on us all.
You're really not
that funny at all, bird brain.
Come on, relax.
Last I heard of Marty, he'd joined IBM.
He's forgotten about us, believe me.
Okay, but, just stop fooling around, huh?
You're getting to be a pain in the ass.
Yeah.
All right, all right.
Hey look, I don't know about you guys,
but I'm drinking some beer.
Sounds all right to me.
Good shit, man.
You want it, too?
Hey, that stuff costs.
Yeah, but it's better than grass.
Jesus, 11:30.
Time flies when you're high, man.
Skip, I want to go pee.
So?
So it's creepy out there.
I want someone to go with me.
Don't look at me. Remember?
No boys in the girls' locker room.
I'll go with you.
And watch out for the boogeyman, girls.
I'm going to explode.
You bastards! I wet myself!
You morons!
When the hell are you gonna grow up?
Hey, dry off fast, girls!
What the hell do you kids
think you're doing?
Don't you know you're trespassing?
Hey, man, don't do that.
You nearly gave me a coronary.
It's old Digby.
You used to be the janitor here.
I am the caretaker now.
What's the difference?
Well, the caretaker's a man
who takes care of a place.
The janitor, he...
Janits it.
Now, don't you get smart with me, boy.
Hey, say, don't I know you from somewhere?
Yeah, sure.
You remember me.
Skip Pollack.
Pollack? Can't say I do.
But what are you kids
doing here, anyway?
This place has been closed now
for nearly five years.
Five years?
Pollack. Hey, I remember you.
Yeah.
Boy, you was a pain in the ass.
And I thought I was one hell of a guy.
Well, you ain't changed much.
By the way, they're knocking down
this old place here next month,
so if you want to have a last look around,
that's all right by me.
But just you don't go and start no fires.
Okay, man. Relax.
Hey, have a beer.
Enjoy yourself.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, I guess an old caretaker's
gotta take care of himself, too.
- Good night.
- Okay, boys.
Good night.
Ah, yes. I'll be heading out before midnight.
Yes, sir. Oh, yeah.
Goddamn kids.
Hey, I thought I told you kids
I don't want no trouble.
Hey, Skip.
Want to earn ten bucks?
Nance, you can have me for free.
See this quarter?
All you gotta do is drop it
off your head into this funnel, twice.
You gotta be kidding.
It's not as easy as it looks.
It'll be a cinch.
Now, lean back real far and close your eyes.
That's it.
Now, when I say go,
you lean forward slowly
and drop it right in the funnel.
- Okay.
- Go.
- Yes! Ten bucks!
- Wow!
You ain't got nothing down there, Skip.
How could you miss?
You gotta do it twice, dummy.
All right, all right.
Give me the quarter.
Go!
Hey!
The little boy wet his panties.
It's after midnight.
What are you talking about?
It's April Fool's Day.
Or can't you take a joke, Skip?
Yeah, I can take a joke.
Give me a beer.
Hey, Ted.
Show us how you sink a beer.
I'll show you.
You're past it, Frank.
Let Ted do it.
Ted's full of shit.
Atta boy.
Okay.
Five, four, three two, one!
You want to pound down this?
Are you okay?
I feel sick!
I can't get the door open!
Try the window!
- Oh, shoot.
- Is she all right?
She'll be okay.
What's happened to Shirley?
She's still up there.
Want to go for her?
You ain't gonna get me back up there.
No way!
All right, well, we stick together.
There's gotta be a way out.
Shit!
The whole goddamn place is locked tight.
Well, one of us
has got to do something!
All right. Just hold your water!
Let me try it.
Keep going, Carl! Kick it, man!
Come on, Putney!
Be careful!
Who's got the fastest car?
Carol does.
Give me the keys.
Here, she always starts first time.
Just get in and drive like hell!
Shit.
What the hell is he doing?
I can't see!
I thought you said she started every time!
Every time except now.
He's done it!
What the hell's he doing?
He's turning around!
Get back! Go for help!
No!
Come on, let's go find her.
I'll stay with Nancy!
Oh, my God!
Marty's come back!
No, that's crazy.
What happened to Marty was an accident.
It wasn't our fault!
Of course it was!
And Marty knows it!
I'm scared, Frank!
It's... It's all right, baby.
I'm here.
Susan!
Susan, go back!
Skip! Frank!
Hey, you guys, stop fooling around!
This isn't funny!
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Skip!
Frank!
Marty?
Marty Rantzen?
Shirley's dead.
- Dead?
- You don't want to see it.
Oh, Christ.
I saw Susan.
Susan?
- Susan?
- She's out there.
Isn't that her car?
If Susan's out there, then...
then so is he.
What are we gonna do, Frank?
What the fuck are we gonna do?
Joe said he saw a tractor,
when you came in.
I've got an idea.
A tractor?
There it is.
Do you think it'll bust
through these doors?
There's only one way to find out.
You're never gonna bust out of here
in this piece of shit.
You gotta be kidding me.
- You got any better ideas?
- No.
Then button it!
Think you can start it, Joe?
If the engine ain't seized up,
it's got a chance.
Hey, oil! Good stuff.
And gas.
About a half a gallon.
Well, how far's that gonna get us?
Ten, 12 miles.
Unless you want to cut grass.
Hey, never you mind how far.
You just open those doors,
and everybody'll look after
their own ass, all right?
Anything we can do?
No. Just let me do what I know best.
So why don't you take care
of Stella and the girls, huh?
Okay. How long you gonna be?
Maybe an hour.
Maybe more.
I'll call when I'm finished.
Call?
You do more than call, Joe.
You holler loud and clear.
You understand me?
Loud and clear.
Frank.
I wish things could have
turned out different.
How do you mean?
With Joe and me.
I don't follow.
Sometimes, I just wish
it would have been you and me.
Come on, Stella.
Joe's a good guy.
Sure, Joe's good.
And I'm bad.
He takes care of me,
but only after he's taken care
of his goddamn truck.
It wouldn't be right.
Not with you and the kid and all that.
It could have just as easily
been a little Frank.
I don't get you.
You're his father, Frank.
What?
You can't have forgotten.
The summer of '80?
June 23rd? 2:30?
Yes. Sure!
Why didn't you tell me?
I tried, Frank. I tried.
But you weren't around.
And then Joe came along,
and it seemed so much easier just to...
Jesus!
I want to go to bed with you, Frank.
Now?
What about Joe?
Joe? Joe's busy.
He's still fixing his goddamn machines.
That's not what I meant.
Come on, baby. We've got time.
Well, say Joe came back.
Joe won't come back.
It's okay.
What do you think I've got to offer you?
I ain't no hero no more.
Frank.
I'm in the home stretch.
Hey, pass me the wrench,
will you, Frank?
Thanks.
Oh, shit.
Don't mess with that. Don't...
Aw, shit.
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, Frank?
Get this thing off me!
Crazy son of a bitch!
Get this fucking thing off me!
No.
No.
This never happened to me before.
I thought this sensi shit
is supposed to get you real hot.
Hey, Frank, the Surgeon General's right.
This stuff does damage your health.
Lay off, will you?
Ease up, Frank.
You're supposed to enjoy it.
Say, you ain't turned gay on us, have you?
Come here.
Where's Frank and Stella?
While the cat's away...
They can't be.
At a time like this?
What about Joe?
He's fixing the tractor.
Come on, don't stop now.
I can't.
I can't.
Talk dirty, Frank.
- Talk dirty.
- Fuck. Tits.
Dirty, dirty.
Fuck.
Tits, screw.
Aw, shit!
I should have kept my leathers on.
Don't stop now, Frank.
Don't stop now.
I'm coming, Frank.
I'm coming!
Jesus Christ.
Stella must've really needed that.
Has anybody checked Joe?
Joe's dead.
Get upstairs, quick.
Let's stick together.
Oh, my God.
You bastard!
You filthy, stinking bastard, Marty!
What do you want from us?
Come out and show yourself,
you little prick!
You hear me, Marty?
Come out and show yourself!
I'll get you for this, Rantzen.
You fucking little asshole,
I'll get you for this!
Come out, you ugly son of a bitch!
You hear me? Come out!
What do we do now?
We wait.
Wait? What for?
Marty's got to show himself sooner or later.
All we do is put our backs
to the wall and wait for him.
Nancy, listen.
It's dawn.
April Fool's Day ends at noon.
Marty won't hurt us
after midday, I'm sure of it.
You're sure.
Well, that's great.
If it hadn't been for you
and your stupid jokes,
we wouldn't be here.
Cool it, Nancy. It's not Skip's fault.
If you hadn't taken Marty into the showers,
none of this would have happened.
It's you two he's after, nobody else.
Stella, Frank, Joe...
none of them should have died.
It should have been you two.
You both should be dead!
Hey. Come on.
We'll get out of here.
We will.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All we have to do is stay awake.
It'll be a cinch.
Where's Skip?
I don't know.
I fell asleep.
I'm going to look for him.
No. It's safer here.
It's past 11:00.
So?
April Fool's ends at noon.
If we can last out
one more hour, we're safe.
I don't know.
Marty's stuck to the rules so far.
We've got to find Skip.
Are you going to come?
You're not getting me out there. No way.
Suit yourself.
Hey!
Wait for me!
I don't understand it!
They're gone.
I never meant to hurt Marty.
Please, let me go home.
Please, let me go home.
Shut up!
We got to find Skip,
then we can go home.
Promise?
I promise.
Careful, now.
Oh, no.
Marty's yearbook.
What the hell is going on in here?
Just having a little fun...
My picture.
He's going to get me next.
Nancy? Nancy!
Nancy, come back!
Don't be stupid! Nancy!
No!
No!
No. Please, no!
Please! No!
No!
Please!
Oh, God!
Skip!
No!
Marty!
How do you want it?
Please, stop. No!
- Hot or cold?
- No! No!
Marty, no! Please stop... No!
I showed you!
April fool!
April fucking fool, you motherfuckers!
I showed you! Me, Marty Rantzen!
Oh, Marty!
Marty.
Marty.
You're dead meat, Marty.
Can't you take a joke, Marty?
Smoke this, Marty.
Hot or cold, Marty?
Remember me, wuss?
Show us your stuff, Marty.
You're all alone, Marty.
Relax, Marty.
The plastic surgeons
have done a great job.
You'll be able to take off
the bandages in a couple weeks.
How can anybody...
How can anybody see if I don't?
Nurse?
Nurse, everything okay?
Go! Get off!
How can anybody...
How can anybody see if I don't?
I'll get you!
