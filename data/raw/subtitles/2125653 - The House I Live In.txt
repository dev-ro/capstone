Narrator: My family came to
America fleeing persecution in Europe.
For my mom's parents, it
was the pogroms in Russia...
in which thousands of Jews died.
For my dad, it was Hitler,
The Creation of the Ghettos...
and the final solution
that killed millions.
As children, my brothers and I were told...
that we were the lucky ones
who made it out
But with that luck,
came a responsibility…
"never again" didn't just mean that
people like us shouldn't suffer
It means that others would
not have to suffer either.
Do you want to join me, here?
May you be seated,
please, ladies and gentlemen.
Come on, Dr. Jaffe.
Mr. Krogh.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would
like to summarize for you the
meeting that I have just had
with bipartisan leaders.
Public Enemy Number
1 in the United States...
is drug abuse.
Uh, gold teeth, maybe in his 30s,
..and wears, like a turban on the head.
Louie and the crew.
Keep in mind that school is going to
let these students out in 15 minutes.
The discrepancy measures the
distance by which we
have not yet attained democracy
in these United States.
Sure, we have problems over this nation.
But never forget
There's nothing wrong with America today
that a good election won't cure.
You go right up Charles street, right?
Go past ledge...
Ronald Reagan: that's why I believe
the tide of battle has turned
and we begin to win the
crusade for a drug-free America.
Voice Over: What shame
that we American people
could so act and be so
non-understanding.
The building has a long side wall.
And the suspect's getting out.
All right. Let's go get him.
Okay. Deal is good.
We got him. Yeah.
If he doesn't put you in jail, wonderful.
Nobody with any sense likes to go to jail.
But if he puts you
in jail, you go in that jail...
and transform it From
a dungeon of shame
to a haven of freedom and dignity.
All of us must overcome the crippling
legacy of bigotry and injustice.
And to all those who have
wondered if America’s beacon
still burns as bright
tonight we prove once more
that the true strength of our nation
comes from the enduring
power of our ideals...
democracy, liberty, opportunity,
and unyielding hope.
Nannie: My name is Nannie Jeter.
I was born in Crewe,
Virginia, a very small town.
Coming north, I figured I would
prove that I was gonna conquer
that was going to conquer everything...
that needed to be conquered.
Narrator: Nannie Jeter was
like a second mother to me.
Though she started out working
for my family,
she was never a nanny.
Nannie is actually her name.
They just have some of everything.
Tonight is a celebration night.
Our families were close...
and her children and grandchildren
were my playmates growing up.
How are you, my precious?
You hungry?
But as we got older, I saw
many of them struggle...
with poverty, joblessness,
crime and worse.
Senator Obama has an advantage but it's
still very early, very early in this night.
When I asked Nannie what she thought
might have gone wrong
her answer was
surprisingly simple.
Nannie: I think drugs...
drugs is a monster.
The killing, the stealing.
There are people being destroyed.
It's devastating.
What happened to my son with drugs,
I would love to change that.
Drugs in America.
Pollsters have identified that as the
number-one issue in this country.
They're smoking cigarettes and taking
drugs in growing numbers.
Doctors find out will's taken
an overdose of crack.
The battle for control of
the drug market is deadly.
Most of the victims are young
black people who live...
to understand what drugs had done to
Nannie Jeter's family and others like it
I wanted to get out on the road
to talk to people.
Woman: I know firsthand the devastation…
we as a family have had to endure
because of the drugs.
Putting it before my kids, putting it
before my mom, my sister, my dad
I had two kids, and I kind of lost them to
the streets because of my own problems.
Time and again, I learned how
one person's struggle
had grown into a crisis for their family
and the community.
By a show of hands, how many people here
had any kind of drug involvement?
I'm in here for selling drugs.
I have a life-and-30-year sentence.
I killed a guy back in 1984.
Narrator: How did it happen?
I just... dope and out of my head
and I wind up shooting a guy in
the mouth and killed him.
But as I began to look around,
the very real problems
associated with drug abuse
began to seem just one part of an even
larger problem facing the country.
It's absolutely true
that drugs have destroyed lives...
that heroin and
cocaine, for example...
do nothing to engender individual dignity.
But, while covering the
drug war as a journalist
for more than a decade,
I came to understand that
what drugs haven't destroyed,
the war against them has.
Freeze!
The war against drugs is
heating up.
Somebody down the road said, "we're gonna fight a
war against illicit drugs, because drugs are bad.
Okay. There's no argument there.
But think about where we are 30
years later.
You know, if you look at all the
money spent on drug enforcement,
in prisons,
probation officers...
judges, narcotics
agents, on interdiction
And everything else that has expanded
due to the war on drugs
..it gratifies us.
It makes us feel like we're tough on crime.
Put 'em away.
Put 'em away where they belong.
Simon: But to what end?
We are the jailingest country
on the planet.
Beyond Saudi Arabia, china, or
Russia
nobody jails their population
at the rate that we do
and yet drugs are purer than
ever before.
They're more available.
There are younger and younger kids willing
to sell them.
It'd be one thing if it was
draconian and it worked.
But it's draconian and it doesn't
work and it just leads to more.
Be hitting the shit from the
store.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Making it work for you, man.
I'm gonna really fuck the
game up with that.
I'm not a big, super drug
dealer.
Yes. Yes, I have
some weed, so...
I do what I have to do.
I know how to survive.
You know, I dib and dab if I have to.
It's not hard to tell that these
is the junkies, right?
Man on the street:
Hey, get out of here with that!
I think the economy
thrives on drug money.
You got judges that's getting
high, too.
You got cops that's sniffing
coke.
You got people with good
white-collar jobs
that can afford their habits, and that's
the only difference.
Yo, the boys is behind us.
The boys is behind us.
When I think about people living in
inner-city neighborhoods,
I think about the principle of
equality of life chances
You should not be able
to enter a hospital ward
in an inner-city hospital
of newborn babies and
and predict with near certainty...
on the basis of their class,
background, and race
Where these children, where
this healthy newborn children...
are gonna end up in life.
The dope block... that's what
this is.
77 Cromwell towers.
I got it on my arm.
This is where I am from.
For now.
Simon: Every war
starts with propaganda.
But with the drug war…
our definition of what a drug user
or drug seller is...
Announcer: what did your mommy tell you
about drugs?
Come on, try it.
Became almost a wartime
cartoon of the enemy.
Weed, coke, crack...
Your choice.
Some folks will tell you that
I'm dealing in poison
But hey, do I look like the kind of guy
that would do that
to a kid like you?
But the truth is the drugs aren't yours.
You're just a minion.
You're somebody without any real
authority, selling somebody else's dope.
It's like fearing the guy who's at the
drive-out window at the burger king.
Basically it's just about survival.
I feel like sometimes, like,
cops and shit,
they view you as,
"oh, you live over here."
They don't view you as, like,
"damn, like, was it your choice?"
♪ I was born in a dump
♪ my mama died and my daddy got
drunk ♪
♪ he left me here to die or grow ♪
Police: I wouldn't want
to work anywhere else.
I feel the need to be here, as a
minority supervisor.
It is predominantly a
minority neighborhood.
Police station for what?
What we deal with here is a lot of
lower-level narcotic activity.
Well, we do the drugs.
We do mostly drugs and
prostitution.
Go ahead, papí.
All right, I'll start making my
way up there.
Yeah, sometimes I think you can
trace any crime you want to drugs.
Speaking of drug
users or abusers…
Magic man!
What's up dawg
Please could I have the…
you still ain't drinking, right?
Dean, you still ain't drinking, right?
- No.
How long has it been
- Sober. I've been shopping, man.
How long has it been
- it's been two months now.
Good for you.
All right, bro.
- You have a good one, brother.
Dean "magic man" Fernandi...
he's been around forever.
We like to look at the war on drugs as
black hats and white hats
and good guys and bad guys
and victims and offenders...
and, on the ground, it's a lot more
mixed up than that.
Go ahead, chip.
All the drugs are never gonna
be gone.
That... forget that.
To say you're gonna be drug-free
completely...
ha ha!
In drug work, you never really got
that... Satisfaction, I suppose.
'cause you don't get rid of drugs.
I mean, along the way, you know,
you have small victories here and there
but if you look at the big picture,
are we getting anywhere?
You could certainly be frustrated.
Go get 'em.
I'm coming right up now.
Don't let him run.
Providence police, motherfucker.
Don't move.
Anybody else in your store?
Empty?
- Yes.
Gonna be really empty in a
second.
I'm gonna get you the search warrant.
Sit tight, buddy.
Whew! Wow, kid!
You can smell it in here!
Do you want a haircut?
- No.
Are you sure?
- Positive
I can practice.
No.
Chip, he's got cocaine
residue on these scales, too.
Hello. Yeah, baby
I'm in the middle of doing something, honey.
Why?
Bye, honey.
Just doing my job, buddy.
- I'm not mad at anybody.
I made the mistake to do the stuff I did,
and I got to fucking deal
with the consequences.
If you talk to people in law enforcement
..they believe that the
community is completely corrupt.
Want to buy some weed?
- Nah, I'm straight.
How about coke?
You want to buy some coke?
They believe everybody is
living off drug money,
that there is no moral center.
They see communities that blame
everybody but themselves
..for what is going on...
and then you talk to
those communities...
..and they genuinely believe
that law enforcement...
is using drug laws to
destroy the community.
Over time, I have discovered
that everybody involved
hates what's going on.
It's interesting with this war on drugs
how little the American people know.
I had never thought about it before.
Like how people feel about
drugs and everything like that?
That's what you mean, "the war on drugs"?
As I started to ask around
..I found that if people knew
anything about the war on drugs,
they thought I was talking about
something in a foreign country.
Announcer: 6,500 people died in Mexico...
in drug-related
violence last year.
Yet surprisingly, very few
seem to have any idea
of the war going on in
their own country.
I haven't heard the term
"war on drugs" since the '80s.
Bowden: the biggest
drug industry in the world...
isn't in Mexico.
It's not in Colombia.
..it's not in Afghanistan...
..it's in in the United States.
We in the United States,
perhaps our dirty little secret,
..is that between 10 and 16 billion
dollars are spent by Americans...
..to pay for these illegal drugs,
creating a demand.
The thing with the war on drugs is
it tries to deal with a health problem
as if it was a legal problem.
Addiction is an effect of human
unhappiness and human suffering.
When people are distressed,
they want to soothe their distress.
When people are in pain, they
want to soothe their pain.
So, the real question is not
"why the addiction?" but "why the pain?"
one of the realities is most people
getting arrested in this country for drugs
..are selling drugs to
support their own habit.
And if you stand in a federal court,
you're watching poor, uneducated people
be fed into a machine
like meat to make sausage.
It's just bang, bang, bang, next.
My mother used to tell me that
I was gonna die before I turned 18.
I think I believed that.
When I was, like, 14 years old,
that's when I really started gangbanging.
I started getting into
fights and stuff like that.
Now I'm 28 years old
being sentenced for
50 grams of crack cocaine.
I'm Mark Bennett...
United states district court judge
for the northern district of Iowa
And in my 15 years, …
..I have sent about 2,600
people to federal prison.
I grew up around gang members
and drug dealers.
Them was my role models.
Coming in here today,
Maurice Haltiwanger's best chance
best chance... is a
sentence of 20 years.
Drug laws, it turns out, often carry what
are called mandatory minimum sentences,
below which a judge cannot
sentence a defendant
..no matter what the circumstances.
McGough: You got a guy
like Maurice Haltiwanger…
..who grows up in a
bad family situation...
with heartbreaking details of
how he got where he is today,
But even if judge Bennett wanted to give
him a sentence below 20 years, he can't.
Haltiwanger: My mother
was addicted to drugs.
I don't even remember my father.
Interviewer: Why?
He was killed when I was 3 years old.
There was a lot of death around me.
I've seen a lot of people die.
I got a lot friends that's dead.
But, uh...
It could have been worse.
All rise!
Franklin: we are here in the bible
belt, you know, "law & order: Oklahoma."
the prison is the largest
employer in the county.
Employees live all around here,
And if you take out our prison,
the towns would just dry up.
I don't know that there's a job I could do
better in the whole world.
I guess they should have wrote
"prison guard" on my forehead
when I was born because it just fits me.
The job was built for me.
You know, we incarcerate women at the
highest per-capita rate in the nation.
Males we incarcerate, I believe,
the third-highest rate.
- How do you do?
We have 1,500 inmates.
The majority of them are, you know,
drug or drug-related crimes.
I'm here on a 12-year drug-trafficking
sentence. Trafficking crack cocaine.
I am 34 years old.
I've been here since I was 23.
I'm doing a life sentence for
second-degree murder.
I killed a guy buying a bad drug
deal in Oklahoma city.
Never been high on a piece of
my dope in my entire life.
..but I've sold tons
of it unfortunately.
We have a nice, secure facility.
I can keep anybody you want to keep,
and I can keep them for as long
as you want to keep them.
The facility itself is as secure
as it can get.
Lift your genitals up.
Turn around and spread your butt.
Spread it with your hands.
As it turns out, drug laws
have become so harsh that
even the nonviolent can now be locked up
for sentences
once reserved for violent crimes.
I think that a lot of times
we're locking everybody
just 'cause we're mad at them.
We need to lock up people that
we're afraid of.
They need to be locked up, but not
the people that we're mad at.
I mean, I'm a law-and-order guy.
I'm a firm believer of no free rides.
Here you recognize that your chances
to manipulate the system are done.
That door slams behind you,
..and You have absolutely no ability
to control
what goes on on the other side of that door.
And you can't open the door.
This is where most people, if
they're a newcomer
and a first-time offender where they
really figure out that this is prison.
And this is what
the next 5, 10, 15, 20, 30
years of your life looks like.
This is it.
While following the steps that so many Americans
take through the world of the drug war
I couldn't help but notice
that at every stage
black Americans were
disproportionately represented.
You know, in any war, you've
got to have an enemy
and when you think about the impact particularly
on poor people of color
there are more African-Americans under
correctional control today in
in prison or jail, on probation or parole
than were enslaved in 1850
..a decade before
the Civil War began.
And that's something we haven't
been willing
to look in the
mirror and ask ourselves,
"What's really going on?"
as it turns out, nearly everyone
I talked to knew all about the
impact of the
drug war on Black America.
There's no question that the
criminal laws impact
Disproportionately on poor
minorities.
Certainly a disproportionate number of
black people are prosecuted.
Yet while people could tell me all about
their firsthand experience of this
..very few had any idea
where it comes from.
Here's America as you and I
like to think of it.
The land of the free and the
home of the brave.
But from every part of the
nation come newspaper headlines
..telling us of an enemy...
America’s secret enemy number
one.
The drug war began as a war
on dangerous narcotics
at least on its face.
You know, you can trace modern
drug enforcement
back to the early '50s
when you started to see the rise of
sort of the urban narcotics squads
The "narc".
Government agencies charged with the
enforcement of narcotics laws
have been able until recently
to decrease steadily the number of addicts
in the United States.
It was at least plausible as a policy
..because the use of dangerous narcotics...
was truly a counterculture.
It was the jazzman's vice.
It was in the back alleys.
It was furtive.
There was no mass marketing.
There were no drive-up drug corners.
It was a very small percentage
of the American population…
who was engaged in the use of heroin
or cocaine.
Narrator: in the 1950s
as drug use was growing...
..among Americans of all backgrounds...
law enforcement became increasingly
focused on one group in particular.
Why'd you turn the dogs loose
on the policemen?
Are you telling me that this
happened or are you asking me?
I'm asking you.
- No!
Why's the narcotic in there?
♪ Black man born free
♪ at least that's the way it's
supposed to be ♪
there's no question that there
was a passion with which
the early narcotics enforcement culture
pursued black America,
even though the addict population
was always distinctly biracial.
In the 1960s, drug use grew
widespread in America,
but for black communities, increasing
poverty
pushed the sale and use of drugs
most often onto the street,
..making them then an even
greater target for law enforcement.
By the late '60s, most urban areas
had a mass market for drugs.
By the '80s, you're really looking
at the drive-through window.
You were looking at McDonald’s.
At that point, you can't claim that
you're trying to isolate
..a counter cultural phenomenon.
You're fighting a war against a
whole community.
§ amazing grace §
§ how sweet the sound §
narrator: In October 2009
I joined Nannie Jeter at the funeral of a
family member I had known growing up.
Over the years, drugs
had deeply affected her life…
and the event brought back
difficult memories for Nannie.
Nannie: My son James died in '89 or '87.
I can't quite remember.
Before he died, he said,
"Mommy, I'm tired of it"
"I cannot live this life".
It doesn't matter what I do,
..I just want to die."
all I know, my son used a needle.
Though I'd known about James'
death at the time it happened
I Didn't know the extent of his
addiction
nor how widely drugs and the drug war
had affected Nannie’s family.
It wasn't until I started catching up
with childhood friends...
bubbles.
You're kidding me.
That I began to realize the
full extent of it.
Every facet of our family.
I didn't realize my father was
was a heroin addict.
Yeah, man.
I got the news in jail.
What were you in jail for?
Drugs
the war on drugs has been going on
for so long, man, it's tough.
That one there, man, I just say,
"god got to intervene on this."
again and again, I heard how drug laws
had done more to punish individuals
and their loved ones
than to mount a serious effort
to prevent drug abuse.
But if this is what the drug war
was doing to Nannie’s family
what was it doing to other families?
There is a structural
problem in the country...
that we keep ignoring.
We have two million people in
our jails and prisons
..and a million of them are
African American, most of them are males...
many of them for nonviolent drug
offenses.
That is a pattern that has overwhelmed
the African-American community
because we get a whole
generation of kids
who now have the assumption that
they're destined
to be in the criminal
justice system.
What people need to see today…
..is that the next generation
of children, right now...
..with the barriers they face,
aren't going to be like I was
..or my parents were, or
like my grandparents were...
a generation better than those who
preceded them.
At the prison, they told me that my charge
was a conspiracy charge
conspiracy of 50 grams or more.
Shhh...
I messed up.
That's all I'm thinking about.
I messed up.
A reputed member of
a notorious drug gang...
was caught in a drug bust in
st. Albans today.
24-year-old Anthony Johnson
of new york was arrested
..along with two other
people during a drug raid.
Investigators say Johnson had
been bringing crack
from new york to sell in Vermont.
Right now, you've pled guilty
to a charge
which requires a 5-year
mandatory minimum.
Do you know what that means?
I can't get less than 5 years.
That seems harsh when you think about
the fact that he is not violent at all.
So it's critical to present Anthony
as far more than a drug dealer.
John Pacht is one of the best
criminal defense lawyers in Vermont
and he came to me and said, "Susan,
I really need your help with this kid.
I really believe that he
was, you know,
in the wrong place, didn't
have a lot of options."
though Anthony Johnson was
arrested in rural Vermont
he is originally from the very same
new york housing project
where I first met Shanequa Benitez.
So you know Anthony?
Yeah.
Anthony Johnson, he's 24 years old
and he's looking at 5 to 40
years of jail
By the time he gets out, he
won't have a life.
Following Anthony's legal team
as they investigated the
steps leading to his arrest
..I started to learn more
about where I came from.
More clearly than before
I could see how the vicious cycle
of the drug war spans generations.
I wish my father was way
different, you know?
I remember one day I was
outside in front of the building,
and, you know, I noticed
him doing a little hand-to-hand.
And ever since then, I
figured he was a drug dealer
and then after that, I kind of
seen him a couple times doing it.
Did you ever ask him about it?
No, I've never asked him.
Why?
Because I don't ask those
questions. I knew.
..so I ain't really want to hear his
answers.
That's why I didn't really ask.
All right, now.
When I heard of it,
he's selling drugs...
..to be honest with you, to
be totally honest with you…
..it didn't surprise me.
From where we was at, what we
came out of, where we lived.
The drug dealers
are looked at as
really the leaders of the
community.
If your mom can't pay the rent...
..they help out on the rent..
If you need a little
bit of food, sometimes
they will give money
to your household for food.
It's like back in the day, magic
had the converse out.
Everyone wanted the new Converses…
..and he would get them for you.
The drug dealer would come
right up the block from us
five or six of us...
"you pick out a pair.
You pick out a pair.
You pick out a pair."
We come back on the block, we
all carrying sneaker boxes.
He in front of us.
And everybody... everybody want
to know its us.
"where did you get the magics?
You got the magics.
And then we would tell them
who we got them from.
The next step is every time he comes
on the block, you're always under him.
He wants a water from the store.
He give you a $5 bill.
"go get me a water."
You know, the change is yours.
Half these waters
he didn't drink.
Ice-cream truck came,
always bought us ice cream.
And he didn't even have to pay.
He'd tell the ice-cream man,
"hey, yo! Get them!"
and ice-cream man
give us all ice cream.
Honestly, I loved them.
I loved them because when they
came around, it was Christmas.
As you get older, they say, "you
get your own money.
Sell drugs. Sell drugs."
"I don't know how to sell no drugs," I say.
And he said: "you don't have
to know how to sell them."
Just stand there.
I'll send them over to you."
He gave me the drugs.
I stood there.
And he'd point.
And they'd come to me.
And I had my own sneaker money.
I had my own movie money.
And then I had my own power.
Our role models wasn't nobody
famous, you know?
I mean, where I come
from in the neighborhood
there was "hood famous,"
you know?
My big brother,
Dennis Johnson...
he came from
doing the same thing
but it was mostly one
person, my man Tay.
He was everything I wanted to be.
He had the girls, the clothes, you know…
The jewelry, the cars, the money.
That's what I wanted, you know?
But I wanted to be Tay.
I wanted to be little Tay.
Tay schooled me to
the game, you know?
He showed me how to get money
without working.
Hey John, I somehow
just missed your call.
I just wanted to
double-check with you
..and give you a
chance to talk to Alicia.
About where we're at and
what Anthony's looking at.
They're trying to go for 5,
but if not, anything under 10.
They're not trying to
make him go beyond that.
- Yeah
Like, the 5-to-40 was scaring me.
I was always proud of him
But I just always figured that he was
okay, that he was good, you know?
Anthony: I know I screwed up...
Because you know, you need
that father figure in your life.
Oh...
I know my daughter,
she needs me...
and I don't want me and her to have the
same relationship me and my father had
looking at me in pictures and
got to say, "that's my daddy,"
or come to a visit and,
you know, I got to tell her,
"daddy's at school" when I speak to her
on the phone or something, you know?
Because I don't want to
tell him that I'm in jail.
Watching Anthony's child sleep hundreds
of miles from the father she's never met
I could see the painful
cycle gripping his family
but I also had to honestly wonder what
compelled him to make the choices he did.
It's very interesting
people ask the question,
"what about personal
responsibility?"
The only thing you don't
do is blame criminals...
..for the crime that they committed.
You blame everybody
else and everything else.
You know, I wish the
answer were that simple...
but let's just take
a little step back.
There are structural impediments.
What you see over and
over again in urban America
are kids who live
in a crowded home
who are hungry when
they go to school,
Who lack attention because
they've heard noise and gunshots
..and other things where they live.
Kauffman: I don't think
people fully understand.
In the inner city, these kids
are making rational choices.
I profiled a girl who was like this…
10 year old girl.
The minute she steps out her
front doorway
there are drug
dealers out there.
No economic opportunity.
The school is warehousing her.
She doesn't see any prospects.
How is she supposed to get out?
At the end of the day when there's
not a lot of resources out here
and your teachers aren't stressing
you to come to class or not even caring
you know, you're not gonna go to school.
You're gonna sell drugs.
You're gonna do
what you have to do.
To go down to a drug
corner in the inner city
is the rational act of
somebody going to work
for the only company that
exists in a company town.
When that is the
only economy that's
functioning in certain
places in this country,
what do we expect?
Beyond the structural barriers
that promote drug crime on the street
those arrested soon find themselves
in a self-perpetuating cycle,
from which few
ever really escape.
Ogletree: People don't
realize, for example...
that when you arrest a young
black man, he goes to jail
the first thing when he
gets out of the prison,
he can't get a job in most
places because of his record.
If you have a felony charge,
you need to be working.
You need to be trying
to move yourself forward.
If he wants to go back to
school to go to college...
he's ineligible by
law for certain grants.
Woman: medical issues
if you have any...
Ogletree: he can't get
certain healthcare benefits.
He can't live in certain neighborhoods.
His family that was
the centerpiece of his life...
if they're living in public
housing, they can't take him in.
Bill Clinton: The only
people who deserve to live...
..in public houses, are those
who live responsibly there.
He can't vote.
Alexander: release from
prison offers this idea
that you're gonna return
to some kind of freedom,
but in reality,
for the rest of your life, you've got to
check that box on employment applications
asking that dreaded question,
"have you ever been
convicted of a felony?"
It becomes a vicious circle in
which people cycle
out of their ghetto communities
into prison and back.
As a physician, I'm concerned with
the casualties of the war on drugs
which is the front-line
users and the petty dealers.
But rather than seeing the
drug problem in isolation,
..you have to see it
in a social context.
These are not problems
none of them...
that are just intrinsic
to individuals.
..they all represent...
..multi-generational
family history
culture, social conditions,
and human failure.
You know, like, you say all
the things that you knew
when you was coming
up that was wrong.
Now I'm starting to do
them, but I can't control it
'cause I got these problems.
I'm using drugs.
I'm halfway selling drugs.
I'm using drugs.
And now I got these two little
boys... [voice breaking] pretty boys.
..and I don't know how to
Really be their dad.
I know I supposed to.
I know I ain't had one.
And I know I'm supposed to.
I didn't know how to stop
doing what I was doing.
Excuse me.
To be they dad.
Seeing the pain
Anthony's father carries
over both his own choices and
the impact of outside pressures
I wonder how a matter
of Public Health...
Didn't just inspire
early drug laws
but became the
full-blown target of a war.
America's public enemy number
one in the United States is drug abuse.
In order to fight and
defeat this enemy
it is necessary to wage
a new all-out offensive.
Man: perpetrator is
a male negro, 5'7".
The U.S. War on drugs
was initiated officially
under president Richard Nixon
to get his polls up.
For most people I talked to,
the drug war as we know it today
..was born in the
late 60s and early 70s.
..under Richard Nixon.
Nixon: I have no sympathy
for the pushers or peddlers..
And the others in this country.
We are going to restore freedom
from fear in America again!
Mauer: when Nixon
ran for president in 1968
he talked about the problem
of crime in the streets.
Nixon: the wave of crime is not
Going to be the wave of the future
in the United States of America.
Mauer: and this was really the first
time
in a major way that the
issue of drug crime
became a national
political issue.
Alexander: Richard Nixon is
credited as the first to coin the term,
"a war on drugs," but what
most people don't realize is that
..is that under Richard Nixon...
2/3 of the drug-war budget was devoted
to treatment rather than law enforcement.
Because a program of
law enforcement alone
..it's not enough.
Simon: Nixon actually had some
forward thinking
..in the war on drugs.
He understood the
need to adress addiction.
Nixon: That means that on
the treatment of addicts...
..we must go parallel...
Simon: and he actually did some
things that were progressive,
certainly by standards
of what came after him.
Nixon: you don't turn to the drugs
unless
you can't find satisfaction in
another way
in your own life.
Narrator: the more I learned about
Nixon, the more confusing he became.
Privately, he knew that he'd been far
more successful with drug treatment
than with law enforcement...
But publicly, as the '72
election approached
Nixon returned to the
simple crime-fighting rhetoric
that had worked for him before.
Nixon: we must wage
what I have called total war
..against public enemy
number 1 in the United States...
..the problem with
dangerous drugs.
Announcer: Nixon wins
re-election in a landslide victory
Narrator: as Nixon’s tough talk
proved a recipe for electoral success,
states across the country began
passing tough new laws...
half the crime is caused by
narcotic addicts.
With new york's
Rockefeller drug laws
setting an example
for harsh penalties
that would soon be
followed by other states.
Carpenter: you guys better
get ready if you're leaving at 7:58
you are just almost out of time.
Yes sir
you guys be careful.
Okay. Bye, dad. Love you.
Love you, too.
I am very much a law-and-order
kind of guy.
I would rather have 10 police
cars than one soup kitchen
if you give me the choice.
..but sometimes I think
we need to be smarter...
about what those police officers
are actually out there doing.
Maybe because he seemed the
epitome of a hardened prison official
mike carpenter's perspective on the
severity of drug laws caught me off guard.
Carpenter: I think
a long time ago,
we made drugs
into this huge thing,
and we've made it so illegal
and we've made it
such a... a national issue
with that tough-on-crime stance.
I mean, you can't get elected if you
don't profess to be tough on crime.
First, we have to join together to
ensure the drug dealers are punished
swiftly, surely, and severely.
You can't stay elected if you don't
do things to be tough on crime.
Bush: it's to toughen sentences,
beef up law enforcement
and build new prison
space for 24,000 inmates.
You know, nobody can afford
to be the first guy to say,
"wait a minute, we can't afford what
we're doing. Let's do something different."
Because if you even made a noise
like you were gonna be soft on
crime in any way
you would be out of a job.
Clinton: you will be put away and put
away for good.
..3 strikes and you are out.
You get in front of a camera…
And you talk loudly about, "we
need to lock up criminals,
we need to make
our streets safe,"
and so, we become
victims of the sound bite.
The American people want
their government to get tough
..and to go on the offensive...
..and this is exactly what we intend.
I think sometimes we have people doing a
whole lot of time for not very much crime.
It's almost like they're
paying for our fear
..instead of paying for their crime.
Narrator: for many working in
corrections, I heard the same frustration
..that political rhetoric
not only floods their facilities...
but robs them of the resources
they need to do their jobs.
People want to lock people up
and keep them locked away,
And then when the sentence is
over, they expect this person to be
be reformed or
a different person
and if you haven't given them any skills or
trained them, you know, how can they be?
I'm a cabinet-making instructor
here at Lexington vo-tech.
When these guys get out of prison we
find them a job... and help them get a job.
Keeps them working. Makes them
taxpayers of the state of Oklahoma.
He's already got one strike
against him, that he's a convicted felon
but at least he can say, "hey, I'm a
licensed electrician
or a licensed carpenter.
Carpenter: for a lot of these guys,
they've never had self-respect, I guess.
I mean, it's been false self-respect
..because they were tough
or because they stole a lot...
..or because they sold a lot of drugs...
..and this gives them the
chance to anchor themselves...
to something good in
these rehabilitation programs.
Man: prison is not a nice place...
..but I'm glad I came here.
It has made me a better person.
This program is probably the best
thing that happened to me in my life.
All: We are seeking change,
..accepting that we
cannot change our past...
..but we can change our future.
Carpenter: the problem is when
you get into lean budget times
..the public, the citizens of Oklahoma...
say, "if we have to spend
money on something,
..let's spend money on fences,
handcuffs, cell doors, that kind of stuff."
The rehabilitation programs are
often the first thing that get cut.
Franklin: If we don't have
the resources available
that equates to not being able to
give an offender a trade or a skill
and they end up going right back to
the same deviant behavior on the outside.
♪ If I didn't care
I'm Larry Cearley.
I am the Marshal here at Magdalena...
..Magdalena is a small spot in the world.
We are 250 miles from the Mexican border.
(400 kilometers)
We have US Highway 60.
That's a main
corridor for drugs.
I need your driver's
license and insurance.
Cearley: For the last 29 years
in working in law enforcement
the major thing that's
changed is the drug trafficking.
What are you looking for?
The drug guys?
Anything.
Everything.
At first glance, marshal Cearley seemed
from a bygone era of law enforcement.
Cearley: I guess I want to portray
myself as that kind of person
a man with a white
hat, riding old silver.
But as enforcing drug laws has become the
primary focus for police across the country
..the nature of his work
as a small town Marshall...
..has changed as well.
You got that?
Two Hispanic males in a car,
dark tinted windows.
We want it on that side of the road.
- Yeah.
What are you gonna tell her?
She knows you're going to jail.
Go put him in the car.
Okay if I check in there a
little bit more?
Got some marijuana there.
Ed, you arrest both these people
and tow this car?
That's what we're gonna do.
We're fishing.
We're fishing, but we're...
I mean, you look at this truck here…
that's an Arizona truck, Somebody
that's not gonna stop and get a motel room
somebody that's been driving for 24 hours
because they don't want to get caught.
This is telling me that this person
right here could be a drug trafficker.
What's he doing that's
giving you that impression?
The truck and fast food.
It's supposed to
be illegal to profile
After working so
long, you kind of know
who's doing something illegal.
So, is it sort of phony when
people say they don't profile?
Oh, it's all phony,
it's all phony.
If you don't profile vehicles
you are not in law enforcement.
That's the way it is, man.
You know? You know?
Come on.
Okay, now what about profiling
people?
Profiling people, same thing.
That's what we have.
Simon: We like to believe that
the drug war has given law
enforcement all these tools,
..all this authority
in which to pursue...
..criminality and gangsterism...
but actually what it did was
it basically destroyed
the police deterrent
..in a very subtle and
unintended way.
Go on up to 15th
street and Dixie.
He's gonna have
some crack for him
..and some Oxycodone pills.
Sgt. Cunnen: Joe and I are
both sergeants in major narcotics
..and we don't do
street level drug deals.
We do, you know,
larger-quantity cases.
We're looking for the dealers
and the suppliers.
Okay, the deal is good, guys.
Move in.
A world away from Magdalena...
..in the streets of Miami...
I began to see the real
impact of the drug war
..on law enforcement.
Start thinking about why
you're in handcuffs
and maybe you can
help yourself out, okay?
So, what happened is that the second
guy, he's now running on foot.
Yeah, that's where we believe he
might have gone in there.
I guess we're gonna have to
write this up as a separate case.
Totally unrelated to the
original drug deal we did
but we stumbled
upon a house where
a couple of big stacks of money
..a good amount of marijuana...
That's sometimes
how things happen.
You know, they're
not even planned.
Simon: Nobody respects good
police work more than me.
I've spent more than a
decade covering it...
and there are a lot
of detectives who I admire
..for their professionalism,
for their craft.
Hey what's up. Can I help you?
No, Officer.
Simon: The drug war
created an environment…
in which none of
that was rewarded.
Come on over here for a second.
Get his I.D.
He's just cutting through the yard.
A drug arrest does not
require anything
other than getting
out of your radio car
and jacking people up against
the side of a liquor store.
Probable cause?
Are you kidding?
I don't want to say a
majority of the people
but there's a good number of
people probably in this area that
are also involved
in drug dealing.
The problem is
there's a real tendency
on the part of law enforcement
to think geographically.
To go throw
resources at an area.
It's fish in a barrel
for law enforcement.
Any time you need to make an
arrest, you troll through there.
Everybody committing crimes in
that area gets arrested
people who are in the area who
aren't committing crimes get stopped.
It makes everybody angry.
Narrator: Watching arrest after arrest…
I began to see
for the first time
..the destructive
impact of drug laws.
Not only on those they target
but on those who
enforce them, as well.
Simon: the problem is, is that cop
that made that cheap drug arrest,
he's gonna get paid.
He's gonna get the hours of
overtime
for taking the drugs down to E.C.U.
He's gonna get paid for processing
the prisoner down at central booking.
He's gonna get paid for
sitting back at his desk
and writing the paperwork
for a couple hours.
And he's gonna do that
40, 50, 60 times a month
so that his base pay
might end up being only half of what
he's actually paid as a police officer.
The most important thing right here...
we're paying a guy for stats.
You can leave them here...
and then we can go back
out and do this other deal.
Simon: Compare that guy to
one guy doing police work…
solving a murder, a
rape, a robbery, a burglary.
If he gets lucky, he makes one
arrest for the month.
He gets one slip signed.
And at the end of the month,
when they look and they see
officer "a," he made 60 arrests.
Officer "B" made one arrest.
Who do you think they
make the sergeant?
Okay, let's move in, guys.
Move in.
In a city like, say,
Baltimore, where I'm from...
our percentage of arrest for
murder, for rape and robbery
are half of what they once were.
Our drug-arrest stats are twice
of what they once were.
So what does that do?
It makes the city unlivable.
It makes a police department where
nobody can solve a fucking crime.
Narrator: beyond the incentives that
exist for individual officers,
it turns out that
whole departments
have a monetary interest
in increased drug arrests.
Alexander: most
people don't realize
..that the financial incentives
built into the system...
.. virtually guarantee that
the overwhelming majority
..of drug arrests in
the United States..
Will be for nonviolent,
low-level drug offenses.
Cuneen: a couple of months
ago we did a two-day operation.
We arrested over 200 people.
A majority of them
for selling drugs.
A lot of the money comes out of
seizures from the drug profits
that the bigger players
are making off of this.
So, I guess that money
is being put to good use.
Man: so where do
you get all that money?
That money's ours now.
That's my money now.
If I leave this room...
and I go out there
and get my old truck,
and I drive down the
highway with $5,000 cash
in my pocket, that I earned
and if I'm pulled over by
a state trooper who says,
"oh, you have a defective
tail light," or something,
they can take that five grand,
never charge me with a crime,
take my old truck, to boot,
keep them forever.
It's called RICO
civil asset seizure.
It goes on every day in
counties all over this country.
Hey, can we get somebody
to get a tow slip for this
fine piece of machinery?
Cearley: yeah, see, $118,000 I pulled
over right here and we arrested the guy.
That's the $25,000
I got out of that seizure.
That's what we
bought this car for.
Okay, so, wait a second.
So, the police department
operates on the money it seizes?
Uh... sometimes.
This is legal within the
State of New Mexico.
Driver: it's allegedly legal.
No. It's legal.
You're not getting
the point of everything.
No, I'm getting the point.
Probable cause.
Simon: What happens is...
with every successive encounter
between one of our drug warriors
and a citizen that goes awry...
The people around here
mind their own business!
Respect for cops and the
laws they're trying enforce
..is lost.
Cearley: the guy was upset because...
he's saying that we were
stopping him illegally.
..it was unconstitutional.
He feels like he's
been violated.
Is that fair? Maybe not.
But I have a job to do.
Narrator: despite their
commitment to their work
officers I spoke to
across the country
express growing concern not only
about the effectiveness of drug laws
But about their larger impact on the
relationship between police and the public.
That's one of the biggest
hurdles, you know?
How much time the
community has spent
feeling like they couldn't
trust the police.
Narrator: In Providence,
officers who 20 years ago…
appeared on TV as the picture
of tough-on-crime cops...
7-1's got tinted windows...
Today seem conflicted over
how things got where they are
..and what a better
approach might look like.
If you could go out there and
go and cause chaos,
why don't they put you
in a structured program?
The military is a
structured program...
Send them to a boot camp, see
how they make on the boot camp.
National Service?
National service or something.
Zuena: I mean, we're
doing our part out here…
and it's frustrating
a lot for us
..because it seems that
because they are addicts...
..they find themselves
committing the same crime…
..that just put them in jail,
a week or so prior.
Hold on a second.
All right. Whoa.
What's going on?
Let's see your ID, please.
Let me see your I.D.
My ID?
Zuena: come on. Some responsibility
has to go to the parents.
Listen, straighten your kid out.
Well, that's easier
said than done...
when you have absentee parents.
What? why are you...
Relax man, relax.
Some of these households, the
father is nonexistent,
the mother is trying
to raise a family.
Those kids... the percentage of
kids that break out of that
is really low.
Please. it's not me
Zuena: I tell you
what else bothers me.
If you keep having kids,
and you can't afford
them, you know what?
You have a certain
responsibility.
I'm not saying to freaking
control or spay them, but, Christ.
Neuter them, you know?
But come on.
- Spay them.
Jesus.
What they should do…
I pay them like $5,000 or $10,000 to
get, like, a vasectomy or something.
It's cheaper in the long run.
Ha ha!
Why are you laughing at that?
Radio: Everyone's
here but the police...
and they'll be here any minute.
Narrator: watching
seasoned drug warriors
struggle for answers to what
they see as an unwinnable war...
Cuneen: We're actually
doing them a favor…
getting them in out of the cold.
I wondered what
it was about drugs
that made them such a
perceived danger in the first place.
Bowden: You have to
understand the war on drugs…
has never been about drugs.
U.S. Customs officers and police are having
another drive to round up dope smugglers.
There's millions of dollars
worth of deadly heroin...
..enough, they say,
to kill 6 million people.
Narrator: looking to find out more about
the longer history of drugs in America
I found an unlikely source…
in Lincoln historian
Richard Miller.
His research put drug laws in a
fascinating historical context.
Miler: Historically, anti-drug laws...
..have always been associated with race.
In the 1800s, certain kinds of
drugs that are illicit today
..were common in this country.
Cocaine was used
quite a lot, heroin.
People using drugs, it was something
that was just ordinarily accepted.
Opium, for example, was used by
middle-aged, successful whites,
often housewives in the south.
If people were addicted
or abusing drugs...
they were viewed sympathetically,
as people who had to be helped.
It was seen as a public health
issue rather than a crime issue.
But one of the first changes
was on the West Coast…
when smoking opium was
made a criminal offense.
Now, why would opium
smoking be illegal in California
..but not in Mississippi?
What was going on in California,
that was a concern
about smoking opium?
Well, as it turns out, it had
nothing to do with opium itself.
The concern was with the people
associated with smoking Opium…
and that was the Chinese,
who had come to this country...
and many of whom were in
California, working hard,
working for very little pay,
..and becoming part of
the American success story.
But their success was taking
jobs away from white workers.
So politicians got
together and decided...
"we got to find something about the
Chinese for which they can be criminalized
to get them out of the way."
Now, of course you can't
throw people in jail simply
because they're Chinese.
But you can throw them in jail
because they smoke opium.
In the same way, we saw things
going on with cocaine.
Again, it was middle-aged
successful people…
..in this country,
business executives...
..physicians, housewives
all perfectly legal...
..but then around the
turn of the century...
..cocaine began being
associated with blacks.
They could withstand
police bullets, it was thought.
They can work hard all day, all
night long, and all day long again,
..threatening the
jobs of white workers...
And so laws began to be
passed against cocaine.
You're not arresting
these people,
officially, because they're black.
You're arresting them because they've
committed some sort of drug violation.
Next, of course, we see the change
in reputation that hemp has had.
Hemp was a legitimate crop from
colonial times forward,
a widely appreciated
commercial product.
But then, in the 1930s,
hemp changed into something
..vicious and fearsome
called marijuana.
Because, at that time, marijuana
smoking was being associated
with Mexicans... working
hard, working cheap.
And once again, what was being
outlawed was not being Mexican
but just some habit
associated with Mexicans.
These laws set up a very
dangerous precedent of racial control.
It seems that time and again...
drug laws targeted any
immigrant group seen as a threat
..to the established economic order.
But how then did
black Americans,
who came to this country
over 200 years ago,
..become the primary target
of drug laws in the modern era?
Simon: well, the way to think
about African-American history
in the 20th century is
as an immigrant story.
I mean, the transition
from rural to the urban...
it's one of the great
mass migrations
..in the history of the world.
Wilson: when blacks
came out of slavery,
..they were heavily
concentrated in the South...
in farming-type jobs.
As industries were
expanding in the north,
the blacks were recruited
to come to work in factories.
This gave rise to
the great migration
..of blacks flowing
into urban areas.
Narrator: before she
came to work for my family,
..Nannie Jeter had joined the
wave of black Americans...
..who'd moved North
during the great migration.
She took me down to her
childhood home in southern Virginia.
Nannie: We grew up
roaming through the woods,
with a beautiful outside life.
The old Victrola would play.
And somebody would square-dance,
..and it was a completely different world.
I loved life in the South.
Narrator: Now, in that environment…
..that seemed so
wonderful in the South...
why did you ever decide
you wanted to leave the south?
I left the South because,
I had to.
Jim crow... during that time,
you couldn't,
Black people...
If they was raped...
..they couldn't say
they was raped.
So you never heard of rape.
Only the white lady got raped.
But the black woman…
I was innocent, but people
didn't think I was innocent.
No one knew I was leaving.
I wanted to bring my
children up different.
The North was the way out.
I thought it would
make a big difference.
Narrator: Nannie had never
spoken so openly about her past
and what it was that
had compelled her north.
But as I learned
more about her life,
I began to see the deeper
roots of the drug war
for Black American
families like Nannie's.
Sadly, what many of these
families came to find
..is that they had not really
escaped Jim Crow at all.
But found themselves in a
new system of racial control,
..a new Jim Crow.
Racially discriminatory
laws across America...
ensured that poor people of
color migrating from the south
.. would be confined
to certain parts of the city...
that we now think of as ghettos.
Simon: Very few people know this, but,
but if you go back and you look
at how African-American housing
patterns were established
In the 30s and 40s...
even as a result
of the New Deal…
..the FHA which was a
democratic new-deal program
to inspire home ownership
in the midst of the depression,
..did more to create ghettos than any
other federal program before or since.
Why?
Because when they were creating
..the culture of home
ownership in America...
they were exclusionary
to black people.
They put them in the areas that were
maybe a little bit economically depressed
and subject to heavy rentership
and then they
red-lined those areas,
And they would not write F.H.A.
Mortgages
in those neighborhoods.
Once these areas were red-lined,
that was basically a
design for a ghetto.
In 1950, people in these
neighborhoods were poor...
..but they had jobs.
By 1960, we are talking
about the jobless poor.
Because industries had
moved out of the inner city,
leaving behind concentrated
populations of poor people
..vulnerable to drug trafficking
and all of the other problems…
..associated with joblessness.
Simon: and what happens
when groups are denied access
to the core economic
engines in a society?
They create their own out of
prohibited economies.
That was true of the
Italians and the Irish
..and the Jews and everybody
else who came to the cities
..a generation before
African Americans arrived.
Nannie: In 1969, during
that time, I couldn't get a job.
It's like all the
doors were shut.
When I came to work
for your parents...
I was happy, just
to have this job.
Narrator: Do you remember
the first time you saw me?
Mm-hmm. Yes.
You was about 3 days old
when your mom brought
you home from the hospital.
That was the first
time I seen you.
You were a beautiful
baby that I fell in love with.
And you became my baby.
I loved your family.
I guess I never dreamt that you
guys would ever leave new haven.
I've always known that when I
was very young,
my family's
circumstances improved,
..and we moved from Connecticut,
where my dad had been a Doctor...
to a comfortable
suburb of new york city,
..where he'd started a successful business.
What I didn't know was how this
had impacted Nannie and her family.
Nannie: Your mom, she said…
"my husband gonna double
your pay if you can go with us."
I felt more money would
make a better life for my family.
Eugene, that was
the wrong thing to do.
I was always working in New York...
.whilst my kids
were in New Haven.
My youngest son, James, he
started smoking marijuana at 14,
and at 20, he started really
going to drugs.
It is so amazing how you spend
your life providing
and loving your kids,
that you don't see
the mental part that's
going on in their life.
In turn, then you
look at white kids...
..they have their parents
and they have a housekeeper...
that loves them.
But yet, still, your kids are,
most of the time, alone.
Narrator: and what happened with James?
He got...
He died with aids,
from used... you know, needles.
As Nannie and I return
to New Haven together...
I suddenly saw my
birthplace with new eyes,
processing so much
I hadn't understood
..about the intersection
of James's life and my own.
But what else have I missed?
Growing up in the wake
of the civil rights movement,
I guess like many people,
I imagined things were gonna
get better for black America.
But as it turned out, in many ways…
..the worst was yet to come.
Man: Growing up in Florida...
I remember thinking that I
never wanted to leave Florida.
I used to tell my friends…
like before we'd go out and do
some illegal activity,
I used to give them
a pep talk and say,
"You know, God is on our side
because
he knows that we are poor, and
god wouldn't have us be poor, so
he understands what we're doing."
And you know, I
actually believed that shit.
Narrator: Carl Hart was
part of a generation of black men...
who experienced firsthand
the most dramatic escalation
of the drug war in
American history.
Today, a Professor of Psychology...
at new york's
Columbia university,
his past experience remains
a driving force in his work.
Hart: Growing up in the 1970s and 80s…
..many of my friends and family members...
got caught up in drug use.
So I was always interested in
drugs of abuse.
What I do today is that I
actually give people
..drugs in the laboratory
to study the effects...
..of drugs such as
methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana.
Though Carl’s academic research is
on the science behind addiction,
his own experience has shown him
how often drug laws are
shaped less by scientific concerns
than by political ones.
Hart: in the 1980s, like many
people in the black community,
I was concerned about the
havoc that drugs were wreaking
..in our community.
Or the havoc that I thought drugs
were wreaking in our community.
And that brings us to the
major and sweeping effort
..that I am announcing this morning.
Narrator: In the long
history of the drug war...
no single chapter would turn
out to impact black America
more deeply than the eight
years of the Reagan presidency.
What will you do when
someone offers you drugs?
All: Just say NO!
Narrator: While Nancy Reagan's
popular slogan “Just say NO”…
took what would seem a motherly
approach to drug prevention,
..her husband took a
far tougher approach.
Ronald Reagan: We will utilize
the FBI, the DEA, the IRS...
..the ATF, the immigration
and naturalization service...
United States marshal
services, and the coast guard.
We intend to do
what is necessary
..to end the drug menace...
..and to eliminate this
dark, evil enemy within.
AOC: when Reagan
announced that he was planning
to rev up the drug
war, more than ever,
..it was political opportunity.
Because at the time, drug crime was
actually on the decline, not on the rise.
..less than 2% of the
American population...
even identifies drugs
as the nation's top priority.
But then, of course,
they got lucky.
Crack cocaine.
Crack, the super-addictive and
deadly cocaine concentrate.
Crack hit the streets and
suddenly there was just hysteria...
about this brand-new,
demon-like form of cocaine.
Reagan: Today, there's a new
epidemic... smokeable cocaine...
..otherwise known as Crack.
It is an uncontrolled fire.
Go, go, go, go!
- Police!
The American people want
their government to get tough
..and go on the offensive.
And that's exactly
what we intend,
..with more ferocity
than ever before.
Freeze!
Police! freeze!
Here's your crack.
Announcer: if smaller cities
don't have a crack crisis now,
..they will soon.
They're just carrying on like
it's their living room,
like this is their home,
like they belong here.
And they don't belong here.
Hart: what we saw were
images of black urbanites
on TV smoking crack cocaine,
over and over and over.
And then these incredible
stories were associated with…
crack cocaine, and
they were taken as fact.
Announcer: The
drug so powerful...
it will empty the money
from your pockets,
make you sell the
watch off your wrist,
the clothes off your back.
Or kill your mother.
Yes. This is what we are seeing.
Hart: But if you go back
to the 1920s and the 30s…
this is what people were
saying about marijuana.
As Alvin takes that
frying pan from the stove
..and kills his mother with it.
Not a very nice
thing to look at,
but this is marijuana.
Hart: if you say that
now, in our society
..people would look at
you like you were crazy…
But whenever you have a new
drug introduced into a society,
you can say incredible
things about that drug,
..and people will believe you.
Tip O'Neill: Our society
is now infested...
with drug abusers.
Bien: there was a
tremendous fear of this epidemic
that was gonna
overcome all of us
..not only with drug addiction...
But with violence and terror
that was gonna come out of this.
And tremendous fear
led to this view that
..that the criminal laws would save us.
Mauer: Democrats, as well as
Republicans got on board
to pass a whole new generation
of mandatory sentencing laws.
These laws raced through
Congress in record time.
There were virtually
no hearings held,
no consultation with experts who
knew something about drug abuse.
Announcer: The "Yes" are 97,
the "No" are 2.
This is something that
had to be dealt with,
.and of course, you know,
election year fever...
did take hold of some people.
Narrator: With
overwhelming support…
Ronald Reagan signed into
law an unprecedented array
..of mandatory minimum
sentences for drug crimes.
But no drug would receive
harsher penalties than crack.
The penalties were outrageous.
That is, the penalty for Crack cocaine...
was made 100 times more
punitive than for pot or cocaine.
Announcer: The acceptance
of Coke is widespread...
..commonplace among professionals.
Ogletree: whites were
using powder cocaine
..in Boardrooms in
suburban America...
Blacks were using crack
cocaine in public housing...
..and on the street...
And what's the response?
Just wiping me out, straight
off the map, for nothing.
57 years for some small rocks.
Do you know what I'm saying?
I want to know why I'm being treated like I
murdered somebody, you know?
Over time, as the
number of blacks
in America’s prisons for
drug crime skyrocketed,
far outpacing the
number of whites,
many people,
including many judges,
began to question the
disparity in sentencing
..between Crack and powder.
Bennett: well, that's the major reason
why I've agreed to be interviewed.
In my view, it is not fair to
have 100:1 disparity
in the difference between
powder cocaine and crack cocaine.
And let me explain
what that means.
A crack defendant with
5 grams of crack cocaine
is treated the same as a
powder cocaine defendant
..with a 100 times more weight.
In other words: 500
grams of powder Cocaine...
And I don't think most
people realize this.
What is the difference
between powder Cocaine...
And Crack cocaine? Do you know?
All Crack Cocaine comes
from powder Cocaine.
The difference is, you
add baking soda, water,
..and heat from an oven.
That's the only difference.
Stewart: I run a group called
families against mandatory minimums.
I started it in 1991.
I think what I didn't know was
how incredibly hard it
would be to change the laws.
Narrator: Julie Stewart first
learned about the severity
..of mandatory minimums
when a family member was was picked up...
..on Marijuana charges.
After my brother was arrested…
..and sentenced to 5 years in prison...
..I started meeting
other families
whose kids were in for
so much longer.
And I realized my brother was
lucky he only got five years.
Crack penalties are
ridiculously disproportionate...
..to all other drugs.
Narrator: in her fight against
mandatory minimums,
Julie took her cause to the
US Sentencing commission,
..where she found a
powerful and unlikely ally.
I'm Billy Wilkins...
..and I was the first
federal judge in the nation
..selected by President
Ronald Reagan…
to serve as the first chair
..of the United States
Sentencing Commission.
Stewart: In 1995 the
Sentencing Commission...
actually voted to make crack and
powder cocaine exactly the same.
Now, is Crack a dangerous drug?
Yes, it is.
Is it highly additive?
Yes, it is.
But the commission looked
at this on many occasions…
..and found that sentencing
crack cocaine 100:1 was unjust.
There can be no doubt that
the higher penalties
for crack offenders
fall disproportionately
on minority defendants.
51% of the Crack is used
by the white population.
In Los Angeles, California...
there has not been
one white conviction.
Not one.
Narrator: yet, despite the evidence
presented by judges and experts...
..congress was unyielding...
insistent on maintaining the
crack-powder disparity.
I must just tell you,
in my view at least,
the findings are
very vulnerable.
These people are
killing our kids.
These people are
disrupting society.
These people are
wrecking our society.
Woman: All rise.
The United States District
Court is now in session…
The honorable Mark
W. Bennett, presiding.
I don't think people understand,
really, how crucial it is…
how serious this is,
what's really going on.
Bennett: Looking at
Maurice's case today...
..he's facing a double
mandatory minimum,
..from 10 to 20 years.
Does he deserve a 20 year sentence?
I don't think so.
Narrator: in 2005, after years
of concern from the bench...
..about unfair sentencing..
The supreme court ruled that
judges should be given back
..a certain degree of discretion...
..to determine what a
fair sentence should be.
In response, Judge Bennett
did something historic.
Yes, I am the first United
States District Court Judge...
to do a 1:1 sentencing ratio
between crack and powder cocaine.
Haltiwanger: Judge Bennett gave me
a 1 to 1 ratio, instead of a 100 to 1.
So he took my guideline
from like 30 years to like
I think I was under 10
years or right at 10 years.
..but it didn't help.
Bennett: In Maurice's
case, today...
the justice was trumped
by the mandatory minimum.
Narrator: Judge Bennett's
decision to use a 1 to 1 ratio...
turns out to have
been largely symbolic,
since congress' complex system
of mandatory minimums
has the final say.
Haltiwanger: the minimum
on a conspiracy is 10 years,
and then,
with me having a prior drug
felony, the minimum is 20 years.
So I got a 20-year sentence
today.
Narrator: this has backfired.
I mean, If I go around the country,
and I see all the people in jail
for unbelievable sentences...
how did this go wrong?
Well, I don't know that it
went wrong.
It's just, I guess the system
worked.
The system worked the way
congress planned for it to work.
They're not gonna come home and
campaign on the fact...
that "I'm for more lenient
sentences for drug dealers."
Taking on the Drug Cartel
and winning the Drug War!
Just the opposite... "I'm gonna
come home and campaign...
I want tough sentences
for drug dealers."
I just think we need
tougher sentencing.
Bennett: but, whether congress started
out with race in mind or not,
it turns out, in fact
and in practice,
that minorities are targeted
by these mandatory minimums,
100:1 ratio, more
than others are,
..and that's not good.
Stewart: And it's
very interesting...
..because African-Americans do not
use crack cocaine
any more than whites.
In fact, whites use it more.
African-Americans make up
13% of the population in the US,
and they're about
13% of the crack users.
In other words, the rest of
the users are white and brown,
which is kind of
amazing, because
90% of the crack-cocaine
defendants in the federal system
are African-American.
Hart: I came back to south
Florida for multiple reasons.
..to attend a scientific meeting...
And to attend some court
proceedings.
And of course, I'm here to see
my family, because they're all here.
Like so many people I
met in the world of the drug war,
Carl hart's story turned out to
be far more complex
than I'd originally understood.
After overcoming great
odds to break out of his past,
Carl suddenly found
himself drawn back
into the world he'd left behind.
Man: and on the other charge...
the possession
of cocaine charge,
you'd be pleading no contest?
Yes, sir
Hart: so, Tobias is my son, who I
found out was my son
about eight or nine years ago.
He was 16 when I found out,
and Tobias is now 26.
9 years later I'm still
struggling with it
..because I am responsible
for this person being here…
But yet, I had no influence on
how this person was shaped.
Right now, he has
two open charges.
He has a cocaine charge.
It's not encouraging.
So, your situation...
how are you doing business-wise?
Surviving?
Ain't too good.
Christmas around
the corner look ugly.
Yeah.
You should also make sure you
get a little, small, legitimate gig.
I don't care what it pays.
Because...
- Alright.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Just hear me out.
The thing is, I'm just afraid that...
.. you go before a judge...
and then they're gonna say,
"how you getting your loot"
All them kids.
I ain't gonna be able to
take care of them kids
with no $8, $7 an hour.
You know, you can do
whatever you want in life…
But if you got all this stuff
hanging over your head,
you're gonna be
shackled by the system.
Please, man. Just do
those little, small things
that I asked you
to do, you know?
All right. So, I'm out, man.
All right.
See you later
- Alright.
Hart: It's just difficult because I
know his fate.
I mean, it's the same shit
that we grew up with, so...
It's these cycles.
You know, particularly in light of what
I'm trying to do with my life,
it's just sad.
Okay, about 35 million Americans...
report using some illicit
drug in the past year.
But there's this
sort of general belief
..that black people
are using drugs...
disproportionate to their
numbers in the population.
I like to see empirical evidence
be used in our
shaping of public policy.
Now, all of this was
completely missed
in the hysteria in the mid-'80s
and '90s about crack cocaine.
After spending so much
of his career studying drugs
and drug laws in
the black community,
Carl’s focus has
turned to a new drug
..and a new target
for law enforcement.
There is a new drug epidemic
in the United States...
Methamphetamines, or Meth.
Like Crack in the 1980's...
..Meth is cheap, potent and
leads addicts to serious crimes.
Hillary Clinton: all across
America, we've got people
who are trying to lure
children into using meth.
Hart: By the 1990s, we were
seeing a similar phenomena occur...
..with methamphetamine
as we saw with Crack Cocaine.
They said meth would help
me get through my exams.
Hart: But the people who are
primarily associated
with methamphetamine use are
poor white folks in trailer parks.
A fully operational
methamphetamine lab.
Hart: and also gay folks...
two sort of despised groups.
We don't like that at all.
We can't stand people like that.
When we think about
the country's response
..to Methamphetamine...
..Methamphetamine
users have been vilified.
And the reason we have to
recognize it is so we can be
careful or more critical
than we were with crack cocaine.
Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri...
this is the heartland of the
methamphetamine problem.
How many of you are here
on meth sentences, then?
Wow.
Now, how many of you did I
personally sentence?
Man: For a long time...
crack cocaine was the drug
that was populating the prisons.
Methamphetamine, though, has
rapidly caught up with it
and probably overtaken it.
Bennett: today, the average
person I sentence in a drug case
is a nonviolent,
blue-collar worker
..who lost their job...
and then turned to
manufacturing methamphetamine
to support their habit.
And we treat them
like they're kingpins.
Narrator: with their rates
of incarceration rising,
white inmates have
started to receive
the kind of harsh sentences
that blacks have faced all along.
Hey. What's going on, man?
♪ If I leave here tomorrow
♪ would you still remember me?
Man: My name is Kevin Ott.
My number is 203093.
I'm in here for trafficking
methamphetamine.
I start my 14th year in
just a couple of months,
and I will be here until I die.
Yeah. I have life without parole
for 3 ounces of methamphetamine.
♪ 'cause I'm as
free as a bird now ♪
Ha ha!
I can't remember it, man.
It's been too long.
Yep, I fucked up. But I
don't think I should die for it.
I have life without parole,
which means I'll stay in prison
until I die.
That's a death
sentence, in my opinion.
..a slow death sentence...
I have to wait until I die.
The reason I started with meth
is 'cause I got laid off.
Somebody said, "here, try to
sell some of this
and get you a
little extra money."
and then I started using it,
and then I had to
sell it to pay for it.
Narrator: How much is 3
ounces of Methamphetamine?
It would fit in a
small envelope.
If you've been busted
for two prior drug charges,
smoking pot or having
pot or methamphetamine,
whatever it is, and then
you get a trafficking charge,
they give you
life without parole.
It is mandatory,
life without parole.
Kevin has always
been a good son…
That's Kevin. Ha ha!
Oh, you got to see this.
That same sweet, little boy.
Kevin's father was drafted
and was sent to Vietnam.
He looks very much like a boy.
He was a boy.
He went to Vietnam and came home
a very damaged boy.
He saw people that were maimed,
injured, shot, and killed.
..and I think he became
addicted to heroin,
to help ease his personal pain.
After losing Kevin’s dad, Kevin
kind of stepped up
and felt like he was the
man of the household.
Kevin: when I first came in,
there was only a few of us,
..5 or 6 at the most.
A couple of years ago, I heard
that there were 92 people
in the state of Oklahoma that
had life without parole for drugs.
And it just keeps growing.
Hey, Ott?
- Yeah.
You got a visitor.
All right.
I fought it, and it's over with.
It's been over with probably
nine years.
I took it all the way
to supreme court...
and they wouldn't hear it.
So... Here I am, waiting
for the law to change…
..or something, A
commutation from the governor.
..I don't know.
The time I've been locked up...
..my mother has lost
two of her brothers...
one of her brother's daughters,
directly related to drugs.
Hi mum.
- Hi, honey!
And then my sister,
my younger sister...
..8 years younger than me,
was coming to visit me in prison
..in Granite and
died in a car wreck.
It's been pretty bad for my mom.
She is pretty strong.
Ogletree: today, people
have to understand
that the drug war is actually
a war on all Americans,
and I think people keep saying,
"well, that's about them."
Well, no. it's about you.
No one ever imagined when they
saw some of these African-Americans
getting locked up,
getting long sentences,
that it would apply beyond
the black community.
But it does.
Announcer: Unemployment at 9%...
America is struggling through
the worst recession since 1975.
And with no prospect of
an immediate end to the recession...
Thousands of people…
jobless and hopeless, look for a
way out
and find trouble instead.
Before I got hooked on drugs,
I looked down on drug addicts…
..and then I became one.
Oftentimes, we
hate what we fear,
like this guy here.
He was a drug dealer,
so I looked down upon him, too.
And I turned into a drug
addict and a drug dealer.
Simon: you know, a funny thing
happened on the way to the 21st century,
which is that we shrugged off so
much of our manufacturing base,
..so much of our need
for organized labor...
For a legitimate union
wage, for union benefits,
for the types of jobs in
which you could raise a family
..and be a meaningful citizen.
We got rid of so much
of that that, oops...
we marginalized a
lot of white people.
Announcer: 1 in every
8 Americans has had to visit
..a food bank over the last year.
Simon: And lo and behold...
white people... when
they're marginalized,
when they're denied meaning,
when they're denied meaningful work
They become drug addicts too.
And they become involved in the
methamphetamine trade,
and they start turning
themselves over
to the underground economies
that are the only ones
there to accept them.
Capitalism is fairly
color-blind in the end.
Our economic engine,
When it doesn't need somebody...
it doesn't need somebody, and it
doesn't give a damn who you are.
White people found out a
little bit later than black folk,
but they found it out.
Narrator: after
hearing so much about
the failure of the drug war
..and the enormous harm it does.
I wanted to better
understand what drives it.
Far from the front
lines of the war,
I discovered a vast and
less-visible world of people
who, in their own
ways, play a part.
This chair in comparison...
to other types of
restraint chairs,
..is the most humane.
The person in the chair
can breathe very easily
..and it's not restrictive.
I'm not going nowhere with you!
There he goes.
Ha ha!
The war on drugs has to be a
war at every level.
It has to be a war on the
streets of the cities,
it has to be a war
at the state level,
and it has to be a
war at the federal level.
It's just like fighting a
war on terrorism.
Man: before, in the prisons,
I guess the only choice was
you could get a torah or a bible.
Things have changed now.
Anybody want their
free copy of the Qur’an?
All sorts of people start to
get a vested interest,
a financial interest, in
keeping the system going.
Woman: we're in the business of
supplying corrections with products.
It's a growing market, prisons.
There are a lot of prisoners
in the United States.
That's what I mean by growing.
Now you got me feeling
awkward because of the camera.
Put it down.
Man: This company, CCA...
we are the leader and
the largest in the world
as far as private prisons
and jails.
We are profitable.
We are highly rated
in the stock market.
It hones your ability to
do it less expensively,
because we have
to earn a profit.
There's a whole range of
corporations...
the taser-gun manufacturers,
private healthcare providers,
..telephone companies,
whole communities that now depend
on prisons as their primary employer,
now deeply invested
in the drug war
and this system of
mass incarceration.
Miller: And all these people...
are not trying to
do anything wrong.
They are trying to
make society better.
But their actions
combined together…
become part of the
thrust that makes
the bad parts of the drug war
more feasible and more practical.
The thing with the
war on drugs is,
and the question
we have to ask is,
not "why is it a failure?"
but why... given that it
seems to be a failure,
..why is it persistent?
And I'm beginning to think maybe
it's a success.
What if it's a success by
keeping police forces busy?
What if it's a success by
keeping private jails thriving?
What if it's a success
keeping illegal establishment
justified in its
sub-generated activity?
Maybe it's a success
on different terms...
than the publicly stated ones.
Narrator: Perhaps
not surprisingly...
it was people on the inside
who turned out to be most aware
..of the dangerous pressures
that outside forces...
exert on the system.
Carpenter: my job is to
keep the people inside
who are supposed to be
inside, and I'm gonna do my job.
But as I've come along in
corrections
over the last 20 years,
I've just kind of watched
it grow into this thing.
I mean, it's almost a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
You build a bed,
they fill the bed.
It starts sucking in money
at an astronomical rate,
and it just grows and grows
and grows of its own accord.
You almost can't stop it.
You can't afford to stop it.
And so, now, you
start talking about,
"well, we could cut some
corners, and we could reduce.
What about if we reduce by
closing that facility?"
Announcer: employees are
hoping the governor will reconsider
..his plan to close the prison.
"wait a minute.
You can't do that.
My community will dry up and
blow away."
the private prisons, they
actually go to a town and say,
"if you'll use your tax money
to buy the land
and build the facility,
we'll rent it from you,
and you'll get rich,
and we'll get rich. And
we'll all be rich together."
well, that only works if
there's prisoners in the beds,
so now you're starting to
find people that fit the criteria.
Now you actually can pay people
to go out and look for people
..that fit the criteria, and
now it's gonna grow faster.
You can't let that town fail,
so you can't, change the way
you think about locking people up.
Narrator: so you
need a new enemy?
It's the same enemy.
You just need more of them.
Though my journey
had begun with a simple question...
about one person's life,
it was forcing me to confront
unsettling realities facing the country.
And yet, the full
weight of the situation
had still not been
revealed to me
in its starkest
historical terms.
Simon: yeah, let's say it this way,
'cause it's more honest.
Instead of saying: let's get
rid of all these drug addicts...
..and drug dealers.
And once we throw away the key
on them,
we'll solve this
problem."
why don't you try saying
it to yourself this way?
"all these Americans that
we don't need anymore...
..the factories are closed.
We don't need them"
you know, "the textile mills,
they're gone.
..GM (General Motors) is closing
plants, we don't need these people.
They're extra Americans.
We don't need them.
Let's just get rid of the
bottom 15% of the country.
Let's lock them up.
In fact, let's see if we can make money
off locking them up in the short-term.
Even though it's gonna be an
incredible burden for our society,
even though it's gonna
destroy these families
where these people
are probably integral
to the lives of other Americans,
let's just get rid of them", you know?
At that point, why don't
you just say, "kill the poor"?
"if we kill the poor, we're
gonna be a lot better off."
because that's what the
drug war has become.
Miler: My father was a
war crimes investigator…
..in Europe after World War 2.
And we often talked
about his experiences.
I was reading the
work of Raul Hilberg,
who wrote about the
destruction of European Jews
..and the Holocaust.
We've long known that the
process of destruction
was an undertaking step by step.
Miller: I realized that there
was a chain of destruction…
that what he was talking
about could be expressed
..like links in a chain
around the world...
..in more than one society.
People do the same
things again and again,
..decade after decade,
century after century.
Now, this chain of destruction
begins with the phase
.. we can call: identification...
..in which the group of people
is identified as a cause...
..for problems for society.
People start to perceive
their fellow citizens
..as bad or evil.
They used to be worthwhile people…
but now, all of a
sudden, for some reason,
..their lives are worthless.
The second link in the chain
of destruction is: ostracism...
by which we learn how
to hate these people
and how to take their jobs away,
how to make it harder
for them to survive.
People lose their place to live.
Often, they're
forced into ghettos
where they're
physically isolated,
..separate from the rest of society.
The third link is confiscation.
People lose their
rights, civil liberties.
The laws themselves change so
it's made easier
for people to be
stopped on the street,
patted down, searched,
and for their property
to be confiscated.
Now, once you start taking
people's property away,
you can start taking the
people themselves away.
And the fourth link is concentration.
Concentrate them into
facilities such as prisons, camps.
People lose their rights.
They can't vote anymore,
have children anymore.
Often, their labor is exploited,
and in a very systematic form.
And the final link in the
chain of destruction...
is annihilation.
Now, this might be indirect,
by, say, withholding
medical care,
withholding food,
preventing further birth.
Or it might be direct,
where death is inflicted
..where people are
deliberately killed.
These steps tend to happen
of their own momentum
without anybody
forcing them to happen.
I think a lot of people would
be disturbed and outraged
by the thought that
any part of this process
could be going on in America.
But it wasn't until I began
studying the drug war
that I realized that some of
these same steps were happening.
For instance, identification.
All of us agree that the
gravest domestic threat
facing our nation
today is drugs.
Bowden: The way
to take a problem...
..and make it a huge problem…
is, first, you ask
the wrong question,
and then you feed us
the wrong answer.
Bush: Who is responsible?
Let me tell you straight out…
Everyone who uses drugs.
Everyone who sells drugs.
And everyone who
looks the other way.
Bien: You identify people,
their characteristics...
You make them "other"
using fear mongering,
as if they're the
cause of our problems.
These people are
killing our kids.
These people are disrupting society...
These people are wrecking our
society.
Miller: secondly, ostracism.
Society learns to
hate drug users.
If you are a casual drug user
you are an accomplice to murder.
You apply special laws to
them that don't apply to others.
Now, all of a sudden,
these people who've
previously just been
identified as drug users
..become criminals.
Bill Clinton: If you break the law...
you no longer have a
home in public housing.
Kaufman: The ultimate
effect is isolation.
Being cut off from
mainstream society.
Carpenter: we started out...
we identify them.
We figure out who they are.
Then we start making laws
..to prevent them from
being around our children.
You push them out of the places
where they may be successful,
and so, where do they go?
Simon: the area of
the least opposition..
..the modern American ghetto.
We manage to isolate
the poor economically.
Carpenter: You force them out of the place…
where they could live and
work and possibly be successful,
..and now you make them...
you make them criminals.
Simon: so, once the
economics has done its business,
then you can have
different levels of policing.
You can change the rules.
Woman: hey, guys!
You know the program.
Get the hands up. Turn around.
Miller: confiscation. Any
property they find on you
can be subjected
to civil forfeiture.
That money's ours now.
That's my money now.
Announcer: federal and local police
seized these vehicles after
their occupants
allegedly purchased
cocaine and other drugs.
Miller: if we're
seizing their property,
it's really a simple next step
to start seizing their persons.
Announcer: Holloway was arrested on
charges
of resisting arrest
and wandering with
the intent to buy drugs.
Alexander: in the drug war, there's more
that's being confiscated.
What's being taken from
them is all hope in a future.
Woman: What y'all getting
him for?!
Don't worry, we told you.
It's a narcotic.
With the drug war, we've gone
as far as the concentration phase.
Bowden: My government
says we're fighting a heroic war
against drugs and a war
against people who use drugs.
And frankly, a lot of them
are just gonna
have to be locked up.
Bien: extraordinary numbers of
people are in prison
because of drugs.
Yet, it is not a place to get
drug treatment.
They come out, and
then we're surprised
that we have the
highest recidivism rates,
and that results in this
cycle of incarceration
..and overcrowding.
Kaufman: This
concentration of people…
whether it's in inner-city
ghettos or in prisons,
creates a culture
of hopelessness...
that is incredibly corrosive.
When they don't
have any prospects,
people turn to drugs.
And then we'll pursue them,
and we'll be able to hire
a bunch of prison
guards and parole officers
..narcotics detectives and
drug treatment people.
In the short term
some people have jobs.
Miller: Annihilation.
That's not happening with
the drug war in this country.
But there are
subtle but real ways
that don't involve
indiscriminate mass killings,
such as preventing births.
Man: $200 cash payments
to women addicted to crack
to be sterilized.
Violence in prisons.
Announcer: severe overcrowding
sparked jailhouse riots.
Another Announcer: 27
inmates died yesterday.
Miller: people swept
up in drug-war violence.
Announcer: 140
drug killings this year.
An Iraqi war veteran was killed
after SWAT Team officers
stormed his Tucson, Arizona home
in a drug raid that
turned up no drugs.
Miller: Now it's important
to remember or to realize...
it isn't that the war on
drug users is the same
as what happened
in other societies,
but that both are wars
on ordinary people,
..people who are just like us.
Carpenter: you've got to have an enemy
for every thing.
The way that Germany in the
'30s rebuilt their infrastructure,
..rebuild their industries
and rebuild their pride...
..their nationalism was by
saying that these people...
this group of people is
the cause of all of our woe,
..and if we hate them, we'll be better off.
Narrator: but we're
not doing that, are we?
I don't think it's to that extreme...
..but we do say, "those
people are bad for us...
And if we hate them,
our lives will be better."
so, everybody's got
to have an enemy.
The drug war is a
holocaust in slow motion.
And it's not somebody
arguing racial superiority
or arguing for the destruction
of a given race or religion.
That doesn't exist.
Let's be honest about what
was unique to the holocaust.
But... there is an incredible
destruction of human life...
that is class-based... not
race-based, but class-based...
that is going on and is going on
under the guise
..of a war against
illegal narcotics.
It's gonna be Anthony's
first time seeing her, right?
He don't even know she's coming.
Johnson: I mean, I know they
want people to learn a lesson.
..but to be honest,
all of this time...
is not really helping anybody
for instance, my daughter.
All it's doing is making her
grow up like me.
Like, the cycle's just
continuing, you know?
This is a letter that
was written by your aunt.
She wrote it to the judge.
I ain't never read it, man.
"dear judge Bennett, I just
wanted you to know
a little bit about Maurice.
When he was 6 months old, his
father was murdered.
..That was a sad day...
My sister then
began using drugs,
and soon after, her young kids'
lives were turned upside-down..."
Correia: All the years
I've spent in Narcotics...
I didn't go out there
every day and say,
"let's inflict some harm on the
community."
I think, you know, an unintended
consequence was that...
yeah... we
probably did.
You know, we probably did
inflict harm.
Man: two young
kids with the mother.
Chism: Kevin has been
locked up for 13 years.
So now we write letters,
and we call and we e-mails...
just with a prayer that
somebody will hear us,
..because our day will
come, and I believe it will come.
I don't think my son
is gonna die in prison.
Walking away and leaving
him is the hardest thing that I do.
Carpenter: I don't know
what the solution is.
But I know that the
solution can't be more
of what's got us to this spot.
It can't be more of the same.
Mate: America’s drug problem
a result of hundreds
of years of history,
..economic policy, social
policy and misunderstanding.
So let's not make the most
visible manifestation of it
That is to say, people being out there
in the street and using, the problem.
It's not the problem.
It's simply a
manifestation of problem.
It's simply a symptom.
It's sort of like saying that the problem
with pneumonia is that you cough.
"let's suppress the cough, and
that's okay."
Well, you can suppress the cough.
That lung will still be
inflamed.
And that lung tissue
is still being damaged.
You got to deal with
the whole picture.
Narrator: after 40 years of
incalculable human and economic cost,
it's hard to imagine how
something so deeply rooted
in American life can
possibly be changed.
Man: Mr. Chairman, we
find ourselves, as a nation,
in the midst of a profound,
deeply corrosive crisis
that we have largely
been ignoring, at our peril.
Narrator: but at many
levels across the country,
..there are people
trying to change things.
Man: After 30 years...
all of my colleagues who
are afraid for the politics,
we have to go a different way.
Ogletree: you have never had
so many people on the same side
in this issue, because we've fought
a war and we've been unsuccessful.
Man: let's return to the
focus on prevention of crime.
How can we prevent people
from becoming drug addicts?
How do we prevent people
from being incarcerated?
Too many people in jail that
don't need to be there.
There's a lot that
is not working.
Narrator: in recent months,
under increasing public pressure,
the first signs have
emerged that the drug war,
..after decades of failure
and unsustainable cost...
may indeed be changing.
Announcer: congress
took action today
..to fix what many
have called...
a very unfair gap in
federal sentencing rules
for crack cocaine as
opposed to powdered cocaine.
President Obama signed a new
law at the White House today..
..cutting the ratio to 18 to 1.
Mauer: we view that
as a compromise.
We view that as not
providing full justice,
and we won't rest
after that's adopted.
Narrator: yet, despite a
few first steps toward reform,
those experienced
with criminal justice
know it will take more
than experts, activists,
and a handful of
courageous lawmakers
to undo the damage that decades
of drug laws have caused.
Simon: understand that
the political infrastructure
is so wedded to the status quo
that they're so consumed
with the next election
that there will never
emerge a shred of leadership
that will change the situation.
It's up to us.
Man: what do we want?
All: Drop the rock!
Man: when do we want it?
All: Now!
No longer can drug laws serve
as a stimulus package
for prison communities
on the back of poor people.
Stewart: my takeaway
from the past 15 years
isn't that we need to wait
until we get consensus.
It's that we need
to do what's right.
If there are people like this body...
who are the sentencing experts
that are supposed
to tell congress
and tell the public what
the right thing to do is,
I just urge you to do it.
Man: I believe it is in the
interest of every American
that we thoroughly examine
our entire criminal justice system.
You need to care about
that person down the block,
because the same rights
that they have, you have.
And if you let their
rights be compromised...
..your rights are compromised.
At some point, you have to
stand up and say, it's not okay.
Haltiwanger: you know, if there's
anything ever gonna be done about this,
this is gonna change,
it's gonna have to come from... the
people out there gonna have to help.
We can't do it from here.
Bennett: do you know what
it's like to go home at night
knowing that you did
a personal injustice?
I did an injustice to Maurice.
Man: I'll amend
the charge on her
to a violation of unlawful
possession of marijuana,
221-05.
Narrator: back in 2008,
when I began filming,
despite the excitement surrounding
the election of Barack Obama,
the thoughts Nannie
Jeter shared that night
would stay with me
more than any other.
Nannie: I feel I cheated myself
out of what I could've
accomplished.
Like, I never knew that I
wanted to be in politics,
to be a voice for someone,
to say what was wrong
whether it changed or not
but to make known
that it's wrong.
Eugene, I've learned so much,
and I try to tell it to other people.
But it's like people would
rather go down the same
road that you went
down before they learn.
You make mistakes through life.
It's like, mistakes
is always there.
You make a lot of mistakes with your life.
But when you somehow
blow your kid's life,
..you always think about it.
Obama: But above all,
I will never forget who
this victory truly belongs to.
It belongs to you.
Nannie: I don't understand
the war on drugs.
All I know is...
I miss my son.
