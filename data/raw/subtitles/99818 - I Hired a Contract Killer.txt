The head of department would like to see you.
Yes.
Send the next one in now, will you?
Follow me.
As you undoubtedly will have
heard, the government...
...has seen fit to privatize
our establishment.
Deal takes effect from
the beginning of next month.
The new owners demand certain changes
in our organization.
So it's my unpleasant duty...
to let you know, Mr...
Boulanger. Henri Boulanger.
That redundancies cannot be avoided. You're
not a British citizen, are you? No. French.
I'm sure you'll understand we have to begin
with foreigners.
I understand.
When do I have to go?
As your position here for
some reason...
...has never been official, two weeks notice
is out of the question.
Right away?
Yes, if you please.
Sign this, please.
As a token of our appreciation for you all...
15.
Almost 15 years of devoted service to our
department.
We're going to give you this gold
watch.
- Ozgenturk ?
- Yes ma'am. Ali Ozgenturk.
It doesn't work, this watch? Yes, it does.
That's a good one, sir. Three meters, please.
Three meters, okay.
I came to give notice of the flat.
But why are
you... just like that?
I travel. I move elsewhere.
In a week's time you can empty the flat through
away everything left in there.
Here is the rent until that.
This makes me very sad.
Thank you for everything.
Gas strike, read all about it.
Gas strike, get your papers.
Gas strike, read all about it.
Get your papers...
Five pounds.
I shan't be coming any further Guv.
Walk straight
ahead and take the second corner left.
It's what you're looking for.
That'll be six quid
for the ride and ten for the information.
A ginger ale.
Where I come from, we eat places like this for
breakfast!
I need a cheater.
Usually the price for easy cases is a thousand
pounds a head.
We don't do politicians or businessmen. Too
much hassle. Payment in cash.
Delivery within two weeks or your money back.
Mutual silence
is expected. You still interested? Yes.
So, who's the one you want to get rid of?
The address is on the back.
So, why don't you do it yourself and save your
money?
I tried, but I am too yellow.
It's up to you.
But if you want to change your mind,
remember to get in touch with us in time.
That won't be necessary. I want to die.
Will they be the ones?
We run on you, Henri. Will we, Pete?
Nah. No, now, we're friends.
They are good boys. We'll use a subcontractor.
Would you please do it fast?
I'm not so brave,
you see, in waiting, man. Well...
I'll do my best. Don't worry.
Nice to do business with you. Goodbye.
Come on, Henri. We'll buy you a drink. I don't
drink.
What difference does that make now, eh?
What do you want to die, Henri?
For personal reasons.
But life is beautiful. It's a gift
from our Lord.
Think of the flowers, and the
animals, and the birds.
Look at this pretty glass.
Does it want to die? No way.
You don't
understand. I lost my job.
So what? You get a new job.
We don't work either. Look at us.
We're still happy.
Follow our example. We know
how to have fun.
Now I'm tired. I want to sleep.
Goodbye.
I went to the pub. - Henri Boulanger.
A cup of tea, please.
We don't serve tea here.
This is a pub.
We sell beer and spirits.
Whiskey double and cigarettes.
Roses.
Buy a Rose, for you wife, sir.
What's your name?
Margaret.
Sit down.
Why? Because I want.
What do you want to drink? Guinness.
Why did you leave France, Henri?
Say, They don't like me there.
I must go now. Don't go.
I better.
Can we see again?
Give me your telephone number
and I will call you.
I even got no phone.
Me neither. Where do you work?
Nowhere.
It's a fire on me.
For drinking? No.
Do you live alone?
Why do you ask?
I'm sorry. I'm not
used to talking.
I can hear that.
Goodbye, Henri.
You got a cigarette to spare.
Who is it? It's me, Henri.
Go away. I can't.
What about now? Do you still want to die?
No, not anymore.
Because you met me?
Yes, that's made me change my mind.
Only because of my blue
eyes?
Are they blue?
They are blue.
Well the matter is easily solved.
How?
Go back to the bar and cancel the order.
A wonderful idea.
You are so wise, Margaret.
They probably won't return the money, but I
don't think that matters.
No, except that...
I'll loan you the tube fare.
I didn't mean that. I thought that we could
perhaps let's start seeing each other. Later.
I'm out of a job, you know.
This may sound strange, but these things don't
matter to a woman.
Meanwhile, you go back to the
bar and cancel the deal, and...
...I'll go to your apartment and
fetch some of your things.
After all, the murderer doesn't know me.
You don't happen to have...
You are smoking too much as it is, Henri.
If you really think so, I stop smoking tomorrow.
There is a shop
on the next corner.
I take the counts with me.
Why? Because I don't trust you.
It's so difficult.
You want me to come with you?
No.
This better chance makes you miss me,
and that's good.
Go now.
He doesn't live here.
Sit down.
Who doesn't live here? How do you know who I'm
looking for?
I don't. I'm living alone, so
go away or I'll call the police!
It's a bit difficult without a phone.
He'll be back soon.
I'll wait.
We better go now.
A room, please.
Twenty quid. In advance.
I didn't thank you for the flowers.
You like them?
I never bought any before.
It was difficult to choose, but the saleswoman helped me.
Was it the dark one?
Who?
The saleswoman.
I don't remember.
I didn't pay any attention.
Why?
Oh, I was just asking.
You will have to go to the police.
What shall I tell them?
Tell them you
hired a killer and now you're having second
thoughts.
I guess that doesn't sound too good.
You are crazy, Henri.
I can't help myself.
The truth, Frank.
What do you want to hear?
The truth.
It's not very pretty.
How much do I have?
I'll need to do a biopsy.
How much?
A month. Two at the most.
That should be enough.
For what?
I'm in the middle of the job.
I've already spent some of the money.
Do you believe in God, Harry?
Well, I don't know.
Why'd you ask?
Because if you
don't, there's no hell either.
You take what you can.
Oh shit.
Roses.
Buy a pretty rose for your wife, sir.
Buy a pretty rose for your wife.
It's all right, thanks. No.
Where is he?
I don't know.
I thought you would
know.
Listen, he doesn't want to die after
all.
Nobody wants it, but die they must.
Let me go or I'll scream.
No wait.
I know what you think of me.
You think I'm a
rude, inhuman and cold person.
Everybody hates receptionist doorman and policeman.
You think not good for anything.
You think I don't see and understand anything.
You're looking for
your man.
Him.
Please give me the keys, unless
you want that I really hate you.
We'll get it all right.
I know where your man is.
I saw him today when I visited my mother's grave in
Hampstead Cemetery.
What do you want, lady?
A hamburger and coffee.
A hamburger.
And coffee.
Your order, Miss.
You shouldn't have left me, Henri.
I shouldn't
have been born at all.
Let's go away together.
Where to?
France.
No, not there.
France first,
then somewhere else.
What about the customs?
The customs won't recognize you. The photograph
was so poor.
Do you want to leave your home?
The working class has no fatherland.
All right, then.
We will leave tonight.
I will go and pack some of my things and buy the tickets.
Meet me at the station at 9 o'clock.
I caught them working these.
You haven't eaten a thing again, Dad.
Give this to your mother.
And don't come here
again.
Dad?
I don't need help.
But...
Get going, I've got work to do.
Thanks.
Goodbye, henri.
Goodbye, vic.
You go. Goodbye.
Cancer.
I'll be gone in a few weeks time.
I'm sorry.
Why?
It'll get me out of here.
Don't you like it here?
No, I'm a loser.
This time you won.
That's what you think.
That's a disappointment.
Goodbye.
Faster.
