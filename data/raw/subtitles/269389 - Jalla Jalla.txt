Ouch damn it!
Yuck! Damn! There's shit everywhere.
Roro! Roro!
- What is it?
- Can't you pick up the shit?
- That's your area.
- I've already done at least 10 piles.
- I did 20 piles yesterday, without your help.
- I had my own to take care of then.
Who cares? Just pick it up!
- Don't stop in the middle of the road.
- It's not working. - Get out of the way.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
- What's up?
- It feels so wonderful...
I'm getting jittery every time I come near your energyfield.
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's true. Check me out!
Now I'm totally dead.
I have no feelings.
When I come here it's awesome.
Touch my arm!
- Do you feel how the hair is curling?
- No.
- You have to really feel it.
- Yeah.
- Right here. Do you feel it now?
- I feel it now.
- You are a nutcase, Roro.
- No, I'm in love, Lisa.
I feel sorry for you,
because I'm not in love with you anymore.
- Get up, a customer is coming.
- No, I'm dead.
- Hello.
- Hello.
One snuff.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Maybe you don't know me.
I live upstairs.
I'm having guests tonight but I ran out of coffee.
- So I'm wondering, if I could borrow some?
- Yeah, sure, no problem.
- You will get it back tomorrow.
- Don't worry.
- Is this enough?
- Yeah, yeah, this...will do.
- Was there something else?
- No, I was just thinking...
- Maybe you want to come in and fuck.
- What? Now?!
- Yes.
- Yeah, sure, that would be great.
- Cool.
- Come on then.
- Where should I put this...?
- Let me.
Hold on a second.
- Wait, wait, wait!
- It's twisted. It's not in.
What "twisted"?
Can't you grab around the base of it?
Try to grab...ouch! Watch your nails, damn it!
- You have to relax!
- I am! That's not it.
- Come up here.
- I'm trying to fold it.
Damn!
- It's still twisted.
- Damn, it's not working. It's no use!
- I don't get it.
- You have to relax!
- I can't. It doesn't want to.
- It will be ok.
- No, it won't.
- Probably just a period.
What do you mean, a damn period?
It's been like this for weeks now.
Damn it! What's wrong with it? I don't get it.
Completely dead!
Måns...
- Maybe we should try again?
- No.
- I can be the neighbour this time.
- I don't get this neighbour game.
You said it wrong.
You said "fuck" immediately .
I did not, I got the coffee for you,
and then I said it.
Yes, but I didn't get a chance to...
Bah, nevermind!
Faster! Push now!
But that's exactly...
I missed.
He hit twice in the head.
- Take away that stupid game!
- Stupid shit!
No, don't bother!
I have to check who it is.
It's my old man.
- Where are you?
- I'll be right over.
I'm on my way. I'm at a friends place,
but I'll be coming shortly.
Hurry up! Is it a girl?
Yes, more, more...
- Hello?
- No, it's Måns.
- Liar, it's a girl.
- It's Måns' girl.
- Come home!
- I'm coming.
- I have to go now.
- Are you leaving right now?
Yes...
Damn it, Roro, you aren't a child anymore.
You're an adult, right?
How long have we been together now?
You still don't have the guts to tell them.
- That's insane! It's time for you to break free.
- You know how they are.
- Or maybe you are embarrassed of me?
- No, of course not.
No! Not until I can
meet your parents.
- It's just not possible.
- "Not possible?!" You've met my parents.
- Yes, but mine aren't...
- I know, it's not the same.
But we are together.
I want to meet your parents.
- Ok, you will meet them soon.
- When "soon"?
- Not tomorrow, but soon.
- Tomorrow?
- Can I meet them tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.
- Do you know if they have a dick?
- The ducks?
- No, just two holes.
- How the hell do they 'do' it then?
When they're screwing?
They put the holes together and vibrate.
How?
I saw it on a natureshow.
It was two holes.
- It has to be a stick or something?
- Do you think it's a car?
- So they haven't got a dick?
- No.
- What a relief.
- What?
No, nothing.
- Caroline! Dinnertime!
- I don't want to!
- Come right away!
- No!
Hi, guys!
Roro!
Hi, Carro!
Roro, dinnertime!
How come your grandmother is always here?
Does she lives here or something...?
She doesn't want to be home-alone,
because she thinks...
Throw away the garbage!
- Do you have to throw it on my head?
- Shit happens. Just throw it away.
Hi, Nisse! How are you?
Shut up.
Look, he's improved!
Nisse, say "badinika". "Badinika!"
- "Badinika."
- It means "I'll pump you hard".
- Nisse, say "kocharo".
- "Kocharo."
- What did he say? "I'm pumping your family."
- No, he said: "eat shit".
- He's awesome.
- Real awesome, you and your arabic bird!
- I can tell you are related.
- Not arabic bird. Lebanese bird!
- Say "warning", before you hit me.
- Warning!
I'm warning you!
- Hello, Måns.
- Hello, grandmother.
- Fine?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- And you? How's your shoulder?
- Good.
- Roro, I have called Yasmin.
- Yasmin who?
- A nice girl I have found for you.
- Stop calling. I don't want to get married.
- We want you married.
- Please, I don't, stop calling.
- You are going to be married.
- I don't want to.
I have talked to her by phone.
She's going to visit us.
Please, stop bugging me.
Why? You are going to get married and have children,
and we will be happy.
- I can get married when I'm 50.
- 50?! What's left of you then?
Stop it, leave me alone!
- Isn't this baldy married?
- I don't know. Ask him.
- Marry? You marry?
- What did she say?
- You marry?
- Yeah, maybe, in a few years.
He must let his hair grow first.
- What should I do with this?
- Eat it.
- What do you mean "eat it"?
- Just eat it, take a bite.
- All of it? It's so damn big!
- Take one bite at a time.
- What? Raw? Like this?
- Eat!
It's called "Basal achdar".
It's great.
Take your fathers lunch with you!
- Now?
- Yes, now.
I have to deliver my father's lunch.
- Hello, do you need help?
- I'm just browsing.
Sure, go ahead...
Check him out!
It's a nice plate, this one. Very nice.
It's handpainted. Nice!
And gold! This is gold, look!
50 kronor, cheap, look here.
- 50 kronor...
- I think it's too expensive.
- 45...
- 20 kronor.
20, damn! For 20 you will get this one!
Birds...this one is 20.
- No, that one, but 50 is too much.
- 45, ok, you can have...
I said 45. 40? Ok, done.
- 40 kronor?
- Take it easy, it's not over yet.
No, 40 won't do.
It's an old plate.
- 50 kronor?
- No, I can't. No, no.
- 60 kronor?
- 60? Okay, done.
- 60!
- I told you!
Baba...
- Hey, Moms (VAT), how are you doing?
- Måns!
"Moms, Måns" - same...
It's the same thing.
- How's the belly? Has it grown?
- Save money here...
Do you want to try it?
Do you want more? Come, come!
I have to go and work now.
I'm going to work.
- Come, work with me.
- No, no, no.
Come on!
Yasmin and her brother want to see us.
I don't want to see her.
I said...I don't like that.
- You have to get married.
- Can't I choose by myself?
- Why? Why don't you want us to?
- I have to work now.
- But we can discuss this later.
- You are always saying: "No, I don't want to."
- Why?
- I'm going to work now.
Nice weather.
Roro...
Måns, do you have toothpaste?
Uh, Benson?
Over there.
- What's the matter? You look sad.
- It's not too good. It feels...
- It's been like this for days. Has something happened?
- No, but it's...I don't know.
- You promise not to tell anyone?
- Of course.
- You mean it?
- Cut it! Is something wrong?
Let's take it outside.
What are you doing?
- What's happened?
- It's so weird. I don't know.
Have you ever felt that sometimes...?
If you and Lisa are going to...
You know when you are drunk and about to fuck.
It's sometimes hard to...
Have you ever felt... like you can't get it up...?
You know what I mean.
- Can't you get your dick up?
- No.
- It just hangs there?
- No, it's...more like...
Imagine a balloon
filled with water.
And it fills up like this,
so it becomes...
It becomes too heavy for itself,
then it just hangs there.
- So it's slack. Have you checked it up?
- No! Damn doctors, it won't do.
- Go to the damn hospital and...
- You have to check it up.
I know that I have to,
but it feels...
- Don't tell anyone.
- No, of course not.
- Promise.
- Yes.
- Just be yourself, and it will be ok.
- It's cool. Oops!
- Ok, are you ready?
- Roro, take it easy.
- I'm calm.
- Yes.
I just have to check first,
so I won't just turn up and say:
- "Hello. My girlfriend!" You know what I'm saying, don't you?
- Yes. Hurry up.
- I'll be right back. Don't go.
- No.
- Hello, Roro, long time no see.
- Hello!
This is Paul and Yasmin.
- Hello. Paul.
- Hello.
- Yasmin.
- Hello.
I just have to park my bicycle.
I'll be right back.
- Does he use a bicycle?! He doesn't have a car?
- No, I'm going to buy him a car.
- The youth today are driving around in cars.
- I'm going to buy him one, nice car.
- We can't go up now.
- What?
- We can't do that because they...
- But you promised.
Yeah, I know, but we have lots of relatives
visiting.
- Can't I meet them as well?
- It just won't work.
- It's my grandmother, my aunts and...
- You are always making excuses.
But Lisa, I mean it.
Lisa, you have to wait! Lisa! Lisa!
- Please...
- Lisa, wait!
Hey...
Isn't it time for you to
see a doctor?
They have long wooden sticks
that they put in your penis.
- I can come with you.
- But I don't want to.
Ok.
I have my own restaurant,
lots of money, you know.
Bring your family and I'll offer you dinner, my treat...
We could sit down and talk.
And Yasmin could sing for us.
- Sing the song you usually sing.
- Not now.
- Maybe she's shy.
Yes, but they're almost family.
She could do it next time.
She can sing it at the restaurant.
Why are you still here? You can go now.
Go and buy Yasmin something.
- Here, do you want some money, Roro?
- No, he doesn't want it. He has money.
You seem to be a nice girl,
but I don't want to get married.
Me neither.
It's my brother who has brought me here.
I was a little confused,
with the family and all...
Paul!
My parents, especially my grandmother and
my Dad are always saying: "You are getting married."
- It's even worse for me.
- Like what?
My parents are living in Lebanon,
and they have told my brother that...
- If I'm not married before this summer
has ended, they will send me to Lebanon.
- Why?
- They don't want me to be un-married.
- Aha, but what are going to do then?
- I don't know.
Can't we get married?
And just tell them that we are getting married?
- I can't, I have a girlfriend.
- We just say it, and then change our mind's later.
If neither you or me wants to, why
should we say that we are getting married?
I'll get time to figure out something.
It would be a relief not have to listen to all that nagging
from my grandmother and my old man.
I don't know. I mean...your brother,
he can't force you.
Yes, he can.
Nobody needs to find out. Ok?
- Back already? You can walk more!
- I don't think we need to.
- It's cool, you can go out.
- We have decided, it will work.
- We are probably going to get married.
- What did you say?
- We are probably going to get married.
- That's good! Very good!
Ok, go.
Yeah, yeah...
Ok, watch me.
Buy this one, it's twice as good.
A bit of taste on it too, tastes good.
- You can have it in reserve.
- This one is enough.
With this movie.
Price is down to 30 kr each.
- It's yours.
- What, for free?
Yes, if you buy this one.
It's a bit of latex...
- No...
- Take this and that one.
No, my underwear is so tight.
Damn, it's some pubic hair that...
- You have to...
- Be careful, damn it!
Put your hands here and your foot there,
so I can reach it.
- It feels like I'm stuck here.
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, go down.
- Take it easy.
- How does it feel?
- It won't work. It feels ridiculous.
- We have to try. It was your idea!
- I know, but...
Hit me hard
so I can get this damn cock up again.
Ouch!
Sorry!
That one really hurt!
Hello.
- What have you done, Roro?
- We were biking earlier and she broke her neck.
- Hello.
- Hello, little one.
- Where's mother?
- That should be her feeding the geese.
- How are you?
- Just fine.
Come on! Grab it like that...
You weren't prepared for that one.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Damn, that was good!
- Are you fit for fight?
- Yes.
Well, here you are. The rake is yours.
Let us only use that.
- Hello, it's Yasmin.
- Yeah, hello.
My brother says that he wants us to
check out an apartment.
- Apartment?
- Something he got for us.
But...we only just met.
We are we going to check out an apartment now?
He wants us to meet. We have to
meet, otherwise he will get suspicious.
I'm with Lisa now.
What should I tell her?
Nothing, it won't take long, only half an hour.
You don't have to tell her anything.
- I'll take care of it. See you later.
- Ok, bye.
I'm going to change clothes. - I'm coming!
- Lisa!
- Yes?
Yasmin, hurry up!
We are going to meet him soon.
- What is it?
- Does it have to happen so fast?
- Roro is a good guy.
- I don't even know him.
You have your whole life
to get acquainted.
- I don't even have a wedding dress.
- You are going to wear mother's.
- I don't want to, it's so ugly.
- No, you look so pretty in it.
Mmm...
- Shouldn't we wait with the apartment?
- It's perfect.
Just above my restaurant,
so you can come and eat whenever you want to.
- Big apartment, white, bright and fresh!
- No, it's so dark in here.
But it looks like this,
and it's not very big.
But me and my husband have had some good times here.
- I have found the greatest partyplace.
- Partyplace?
Yes, and I talked to Jamil.
He's making the cake, at least ten levels high!
He wants to have some pictures for the model.
I thought we could take them.
Check out this camera! Payed 700 for it,
but it costs at least 4'000.
Three, two, one. Freeze, what the hell are you doing?
Lets move out here instead.
- Paul, people are looking!
- I didn't get anything.
- It's raining too.
- It doesn't matter.
The superlens will remove all rain.
Lets stand by the car.
- What do you think? Front or rear?
- It doesn't matter.
- Are you going to have the car on the cake?
- No, you are on it. The car is for the picture.
Let's have a big smile.
I want to see some teeth.
Good! There we have it!
- Do you know why he has one?
- Maybe he likes it.
No, that's not why.
It's because he has such a small dick.
Check out his balls, look!
I wonder how many sperms
he has room for in there.
Now he's taking a dump too.
- What are these bastards eating?
- Shit, maybe.
- Isn't he going to pick it up?
- Take it easy! Nevermind him!
- What is it?
- Now then, sit...
- Aren't you going to pick it up?
- Was it me who made that..?
- No, your dog. Are you dumb?
- It's not my problem, discuss it with him.
- I'm the one who's cleaning it up...
- Clean it up then, god damn it!
Watch your tongue, damn it! Don't touch me!
- You have to see a doctor.
- Mmm...
Yeah, yeah, I will.
I love you very much...
but I'm horny, I want to fuck.
Can't we do something else instead?
Watch a movie or something?
I don't want to watch some movie. I want to fuck!
Yes, but I...
I don't mean it like that.
It just feels so damn...
I don't want to, I have been there before.
He picks on me all the time.
- Go to him and ask for a pump.
- A pump?
- Pump...a dickpump.
- A dickpump? Ok.
Excuse me. Hello.
Like this...pumps that...
- This one you pumps up your penis.
- 'Vacuumpump'.
Which one do you want? They have two kinds.
One is strong, the other is comfortable.
- What the fuck? Just pick one!
- Then I'll take the comfortable one.
Wait! Lets see, maybe I should
take the strong one instead.
Are you sure?
For this one "pubicrings" are included.
- Never mind, take the one you like.
- Ok.
Måns?
- Måns?
- Yes.
- Dinner is ready.
- Ok, I'm coming.
- Ouch!
- What are you doing?
What do you call it...I'm taking a dump.
Hello, Simon Pramsten, I'm selling
this very modern vacuumcleaner.
- Vacuum cleaner?
- Your neighbour bought one and he's very pleased with it.
I could demonstrate the new
revolutionized fansystem-
- that will beat all other earlier versions of
"tripleflexapplexes".
The fansystem has a special filter,
a complete new design. Feel it.
Feel it, mother!
What is this?
A car or a taperecorder?
- No, it's a vacuum cleaner.
- It's so tiny.
She says that it's 'so tiny',
maybe it won't clean very well.
It's compact, you could say that's its strength.
It's like a bull.
By the way, it's been tested by in the Government's Testlab.
There you can see that our vacuum cleaner
is the most powerful of them all.
- I can demonstrate, if you like, so you can see.
- Yes, please.
But it's amazing how much it is
just the machine.
- Who is he?
- He's going to clean a little and then leave.
Hello, Simon Pramsten,
salesman of vacuumcleaner and I...
- Have you talked to Yasmin?
- It's getting time for marriage.
- We have just met.
- It's urgent.
- I hardly know her name.
- Sure you do.
- Can't we wait a little longer?
- No.
- Leave me alone.
- Let him be.
We talk with him later on.
- Shall I continue, or...?
- Yes, please do.
They are nagging about it all the time.
It's so damn frustrating! Paul is worst.
- Who is he?
- Her brother. He's picking on us all the time.
- Tell him that you don't want to.
- It's not that easy.
My family is nagging too.
My grandmother and my Dad are nagging like hell.
- Haven't you told Lisa?
- No.
- Why not?
- I can't tell her.
- Hey, how's the...?
- No, never mind.
I know a guy in our family who's
into alternative herbal medicine.
- What's "herbal medicine"?
- Different stuff, people call him the voodoo guy.
- What, Do you believe that I have an evil spirit in my dick?
- He's not that weird.
It might help.
Shall I call him?
I'll call him.
I was thinking about it on the way here.
Maybe you've turned gay.
- What the hell? Cut it!
- You can wake up one morning as a fag.
- What the hell, gay? I'm your friend.
- Sure, I'm your mate...
Bah, forget it! It was just a thought.
Hello!
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Who is this?
- My friend.
- It happened just like that.
- How long has it been like this?
- How long has it been like this?
- For about two or three weeks...
- For about two or three weeks.
- Weird.
- He thinks it's weird.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Has he been to a doctor then?
- He's wondering if you've been to a doctor.
- No.
No.
- Then he must have turned gay.
- Yeah, it's weird.
- Can I check him?
- He's going to check you.
Sure, it's cool.
I'm just going to examine you a bit.
Come closer, don't be afraid.
We are going to test a few things.
It'll be ok.
First to the right, then left,
then around, two times.
It's like...take your balls
and juggle, no, not jug...
I have some furniture suggestions.
Check this bed out!
- Are you going to buy a bed?
- No, for you - for your apartment.
But we can take a "Hästens", install a stereo
with remote, everything.
- That will be fine.
- I have made the arrangements with the priest.
We can wait with that.
We've only just met!
Isn't about time to get it done?
I saw the cake, it's looking damn good.
Shall we go?
Ok, Paul, see you.
- Roro, take the car!
- No, no need for that.
Take it for a spin... but take it easy.
I have just waxed it.
You've got to talk to Paul.
He's arranged apartment and furniture.
I don't understand how he found the time,
but...I will try.
- Talk with him thoroughly.
- He doesn't listen.
We were only fake this. Now he will arrange
a priest, partyplace and everything.
- I will talk with him.
- This time do it thoroughly!
I will, I will.
- I'm going to see Lisa so take the keys.
- But I can't go by myself.
- Why not?
- Not alone with the keys.
Shall I drive you somewhere?
Ok, lets do it this way. We will go to Lisa.
Lets say that you are my cousin.
- My cousin.
- Your cousin.
- But talk to Paul about this.
- Yeah, I'll talk to him.
- Don't forget, you are my cousin.
- I'm your cousin.
- Dogs aren't allowed in here.
- Stupid Bitch! Come on, damn it!
Take away the dog. Take away the dog!
He's not dangerous.
Don't bother, fucking bitch!
Come on!
- Uh, hey, excuse me? Come over here!
- Me? What is it?
Can you watch my dog for awhile?
That damn bitch won't let me in.
- I was just going to...
- It'll only take 5 minutes.
- Will it behave?
- God damn it, be careful!
- Should I hold him like this?
- Around his paws.
- Don't you have a leash?
- Have you ever had a dog?
- No.
- I can tell, but don't let go!
- Well, Rambo, good boy.
- His name is Rambo, right...?
Cool, eh? Look after him carefully! If someone
comes and starts fussing, just let him bark.
They will shit their pants off, I promise.
Ok, I trust you. Later!
- Can you...?
- What are you doing?
- I was just going to correct him.
- Hold him like that, and...
Then it's fine.
Be careful with his paw.
- Five minutes.
- Five!
Shit, look at those balls!
No, Rambo!
Rambo!
Rambo! Rambo! Wait!
No, damn it! Rambo!
No Rambo!
Rambo! Rambo!
Rambo!
Rambo!
Rambo! Here boy!
God damn it! I'll kill him! That bastard! Fuck!
It's a friend of mine.
- Hello, Måns.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Just fine.
- Where have you been?
- Just hanging around.
- Hello.
- This is Yasmin.
- Hello Måns.
- Yasmin.
We were going to visit Lisa
and maybe do something.
- Do you want to join us?
- Sure.
- Who's car is it?
- This is my cousin. Yasmin is the name.
Måns is also there.
I thought we could do something.
- Do you have a cousin?
- Yeah, she's pretty nice.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Lisa.
- Lisa.
- Yasmin, hello.
- Hello. - Hello, Måns.
Come in.
- Thanks. So, you are Roro's cousin.
- Mmm...
- It's strange that we haven't met before.
- Yeah. Well, you know...
- Are you going to marry Roro?
- Who told you that?
- He mentioned it at work.
- Yes, well, they believe so.
- Who?
- His entire family, my family... everybody!
- Just say that you don't want to.
- It's not that easy.
- What could happen?
- I'd get deported, sent to Lebanon.
- Shit! Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.
- What, only to...then bye?
- Yes.
Damn, that's insane.
Almost like that show
"iide-Mosaik- tv" or something.
Isn't there anyone else you could marry?
Roro is so thin, just skin and bones.
- The worst part...
- You are so mean.
- There has to be someone else.
- Yes, there is.
- So you are popular then?
- No.
- Sure you are, admit it.
- People are coming and proposing all the time.
Really, how many then?
One or two...?
- You, your dog!
- Shit.
- Look! Can you see that?
- What?
- It's a face, look at it!
- So...?
It's a latin man.
- That's true.
- It's like a small Dr Alban.
- And you, then?
- Not much.
Who are they?
- You fucking pig! Where the hell is Rambo?
- Sorry, I tried to hold him.
- I can't hear you.
- Some poodle appeared.
- Did you hurt it?
- What? That wasn't my intention.
Take these fuckers!
- Why are we running?
- Rambo's fault!
- Who's Rambo?
- A dog!
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- This way!
Fuck, fuck!
Grab him!
Fuck!
Hello, who the hell is it? - Who are you?
- What do you think you're doing?
- You think you are really something. - Let me go!
Do you think you are big, because you have a big dick?
- A really big dick I bet! How big is it? Eh?
How big is it then? Very big? Big!
Big fat awesome dick, eh?
- Ok, stop it! What the hell do you want?
- Where the hell is Rambo?
Rambo who? Ouch, ouch!
I don't know any Rambo. Ouch, ouch!
Roro.
- I don't know any Rambo.
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?
- He has taken our Rambo.
- Who? Rambo?
- Our dog.
- What dog? Come on!
Rambo?
Come on! Shut up, damn it!
- Are you ok?
- Yes.
Ok.
What the hell are you looking at? I have had a dick as well.
So do you?
You have a dick. - You have a dick.
- You have a dick too, don't you?
- Shall I tell you about my dick?
- Mmmhmm...
Once upon a time when my dick was...
It was like a part of me.
Something I was proud of, and I
could...look at, talk to.
Damn!
- Why are you causing trouble?
- They are causing trouble.
- You can't do that again.
- They followed us!
You will have to get married.
Family and children, you know.
All of my brothers are going to be grandfathers.
I want to be a grandfather too!
I don't like Yasmin. She's
nice - but I'm not in love with her.
- I'm just not in love with her.
- What is love?
Weren't you in love with mother? I'm
not like you. I want love.
All of you youngsters says "love love".
I don't get it.
Måns! Måns!
Hello.
- What has happened?
- Not much.
- Roro, where is Yasmin?
- I don't know.
- Weren't you supposed to meet?
- Yes, but...I had problems.
Are you kidding? Come down here! We must
find her...Now! I have been calling her all day.
- I'll pump your sister.
- What did you say?
My bird keeps doing that.
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming.
Damn, you are pumping me, you moron!
- I'll pump your mother.
- What did you say?!?
- It's a wound.
- Yes, here.
- Do you see anything? Where?
- There, on the edge.
Now your nose is dripping. Here.
- There.
- Ouch.
- Anything from the other one?
- No.
- Where have you been?
- At some coffeeshop downtown.
- Give me this one.
- Blood everywhere.
- Come, come.
- Just take it easy.
Ouch!
And up, like this!
There. Keep your head up.
Wait... No, this way.
Lay down here.
Take it easy with the neck.
- And your head down.
- Careful, careful, careful...
Sorry, there.
- What's in your eye?
- Don't touch it with your nail.
- Some black shit, like a fly.
- Be careful, it's painful.
It's gone now.
- Up, up!
- What is it?
- He started to bleed, so...
- Go and take a seat in the car.
- Yasmin, wait...
- What are you doing with my sister?
- I don't give a damn about you.
- About me, not my sister. Cunt!
Ouch! Ouch damn it!
I'm sick of this shit!
What the hell are you doing, moron?
Damn cocksucker! I'm stuck...
Cock!
You aren't getting away.
You are going to marry my sister.
- But, Paul, I said...
- There is no "but, Paul" now.
I'm busting my ass off for you,
fixing up a partyplace, furniture, even a cake.
Do I hear: "Thank you, Paul, you are so kind."?
Nothing! That's what I get.
You are getting married! I'm not going to
let some dirtbag spoil everything.
- Don't call me dirtbag.
- I can call you anything I want to, dirtbag!
Who the hell do you think you are?
You think you can control me?
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not listening to you anymore!
I wanted to be nice, but you just
brag about your restaurant and your money.
I'm sorry, Yasmin,
that idiot has crossed the line.
Get married if it's so important to you.
I'm not doing it.
Bring the cake and sit on it,
you will probably feel better then.
You think you are so smart, but I
talked to the whore you hang out with.
Lisa, or whatever her name is. Do you think
I'm dumb? She knows that you are getting married.
- Don't call her a whore!
- I call her whatever I want to!
I'm not screwing with you,
you are getting married!
You can go to your little whore,
But you are getting married afterwards!
Darn!
Lisa! Lisa, open up,
I have to talk to you.
Lisa!
Lisa!
- Lisa!
- Police, good day.
- It's about a burglary.
- In what area?
Damn it! Shit!
Come with us.
- How did this happen, then?
- What?
- There is some furniture under your balcony.
- I just dropped them.
Really, how?
I was rearraging it a little, and it fell.
It was on the side...
- On the balcony?
- Yeah, exactly.
What? a chest of drawers, a
TV and an aquarium?
Ok, honestly...
Actually everything started with the dick.
- I beg your pardon?
- The dick.
- Who is 'the dick'?
- Well...the dick, that's my penis.
- Your penis?
- Yes.
All right.
P...e...n...i...s.
It started about three, four
weeks ago...
- I promise, my girl lives there.
- Mmm...
- I forgot the keys, damn it.
- Mmm...
You can call and ask.
The shoes.
That's my girls place.
The clock.
- The belt.
- I don't have one.
- Hey...
- The chain.
How long do I have to be here?
Imagine that, a policeman without a dick.
And everyone was looking at you
thinking that's the policeman without a dick.
I overreacted in the apartment,
I lost it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
But since we have brought you in
we must keep you over the night.
But I can drop the charges.
It's just between you and me.
Ok, that's a deal. Good luck, then.
What? How did you get in here?
I know a policeman.
He let me in.
No, sit down!
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Damn, that's weird, I was thinking about you.
- Mmm...I know.
- How do you know?
- What were you thinking about then?
When we sat on the bench.
It felt like this...
Nice?
- I thought so too.
- You did?
You have a lot of hair.
Loads on your hands, nothing on your head!
- But what...?
- Look!
Let me see, then! You have almost
nothing at all. Ah, there's a little...
I thought...
What was on your mind?
I also thought...
Hello!
- Måns, is that you?
- Roro? What the hell are you doing here?
- Sleeping. And you?
- I've got a hard-on.
- What?! In here?
- Yes.
Of all places! There you are getting a hard on
in a cell. That's perverted Måns!
Shut up, I'm trying to get some sleep.
Eat dirt and shove your
head down a toilet.
- Shut up! Go to bed.
- That's right! You hear that, suckers?
Shut up, you too!
- Congratulations, Måns.
- Thanks.
I said be quiet.
Goodbye.
Roro!
- Where have you been?
- I had some problems.
Hurry, hurry! Come on!
Hello, Roro.
- Have you had your hair done?
- No, just fixed it for tonight.
- Looks great with this one. What is it?
- Really? It looks so old-fashioned.
- Are they diamonds, or...?
- Yes, no.
- Can you come along for a talk?
- Mmm...
Come on!
- What's the matter?
- No, nothing speci...or...
I don't know how I'm going to say this.
I have...
You are so beautiful,
or good looking, I mean.
And...no but...I feel...
It's like a big ball of love
that you crumble-
- so it's being real hard
and I want to throw that into you.
It's like your head is going to blow up
while you are standing on the ground.
At the same time there's a catapult that
flies in the space, like a rocket...
You are going there, there, there...
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
Sorry. You shot yourself to outer space...
I just want to be there with you
like a rocket that's flies around.
I don't know what I'm talking about anymore
I've totally lost it.
I mean that...I am...
No, but I'm in love with you.
Please, don't get married.
- I have to.
- You don't have to. Wait a few days.
- But I have to...
- Do something you've never done before.
You can be cool, eh?
Be like me, cool as hell.
- I can't.
- Sure you can, but...
I can't, I must...
No, I have to go now.
I know that you want to.
But, Yasmin, wait!
Except you, Roro. Go to hell!
I never want to see you anymore.
Caroline.
Tell my father that I'll come to
the partyplace at once. I have to take care of something.
- What?
- Drop it, Carro!
Are you going to find Lisa?
Goodbye.
Roro, wait!
Roro!
Wait!
- What are you doing?
- Don't marry Yasmin.
- Do you think I'm really going to? Where were you?
- With Yasmin.
- With Yasmin?
- Yes.
What did you do with Yasmin?
Get in! I'm going to find Lisa.
Damn it! I'm going insane.
What has happened? What the hell happened in the cell?
I don't get it.
- What's wrong with you
- I think I'm...
I don't know, I...
- I'm in love with her, damn it.
- With Yasmin? You're in love?
That's insane. Drive.
- Hello, Roro.
- Hello, Ulf, is Lisa around?
Yes, but she doesn't want to talk with you.
She is really upset.
- I have to talk to her.
- Ok.
Thanks, Ulf.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa, it's me. Open up!
I don't want to see you, Roro.
Go to hell!
Don't say that, Lisa. It's me.
Go and get married to your damn cousin.
I hope you'll have ugly kids.
- She's not my cousin.
- No, I can see that.
- It didn't sound that way to Paul.
- Do you believe in Paul more than me?
I don't give a damn about him.
I hate him, and you too!
He wanted her to get married, or else
he would send her back to her country.
She asked me.
I tried to be nice.
I wasn't planning to marry her.
I love you. Open the door now!
- Please.
- No.
If you don't believe me
lets go and get married.
Everything is set, everybody is waiting
I'm wearing the meanest suit.
You have always wanted to
meet my family.
Lets go there and you will meet everyone,
the whole family. Open up, so we can get married.
What do you say?
Shall we go and get married?
Hello.
Hello.
Do you think I'm ugly?
Shall we go and get married?
I don't even have
a weddingdress, moron.
Like this?
- Hurry!
- Hurry!
Hello.
This isn't going to be easy,
but I will make sure it will be over as soon as possible.
Thanks for coming, everyone!
So many!
Ok...
Yasmin and I don't love each other.
So... we can't get married.
We aren't going to get married.
Yasmine is in love with the guy
that's standing over there - Måns...
For me, there's only one girl
I want to marry.
That's this beautiful girl
who's standing right next to me, Lisa.
Thanks for coming.
Anybody who wants to stay are welcome to.
Anyone who wants to leave, can do so.
You think you can do as you wish, eh?
That whore is getting out of here.
Why don't you say anything? You are his father.
You have raised him.
I would have killed him!
You should be ashamed of him.
- What do you want?
- You don't know what you are doing.
Måns!
Måns, come up here!
Yasmin!
Roro, Roro, come over here!
Roro, what are you doing?
I told you that I wasn't in love with Yasmin.
I'm in love with her.
Go, drive, anything you want to. Here,
take the key, goodbye. Goodbye!
- Are you sure?
- Go! I'm sure! Go!
- And what about the party?
- I will take care of it myself. Goodbye.
Goodbye. You, go...
Go, and Yasmin, go!
Goodbye! Go!
Stop the car you fucking cunt!
I said stop the car. Stop it!
Damn it!
- Where did Roro go?
- He left.
- Shouldn't he have got married to Yasmin?
- He didn't want to.
- Why?
- He didn't want to.
- But he should have.
- Yes, but he didn't want to.
Oh, I see...
- How are you then, mother?
- Fine.
I'm glad to hear that.
- Do you want some nuts?
- No.
