 >> Love Happens <<
Translated from Dutch by Geonapa
(Paris Georgiades)
Chapter one: Sometimes
despite your best efforts,
life gives you lemons.
When that happens,
you have two options, friend.
You can make lemonade or sour look.
Love Happens
Simply Releases Toppers
Delapluma, Depositary, Smokey
and Wheelie King.
I never have to speak in the city.
Come on, finally.
What, are you going swimming?
-- Had I might as well do.
That's exactly what I told you,
You need the night before a flight.
The less I'm in town the better.
-- I know.
I have been in customer service, your bag
will keep up with the next flight.
But fear not, there is a brand new
Pick up your waiting.
Where did you get this.
-- Rain Makers ensure rain ...
There is a beautiful silver tie of
edge, you will love it.
Silk?
-- Well, there's a red with, okay.
See your best out there,
please.
Listen, the three walk into Unicoop
to New York after tomorrow ...
to see if we have an agreement
can make.
All three?
I'm fucking Marshall Lane.
Burke, would you one time in your life
the elevator to take, please?
You coming to the seminar?
Great day.
Without delay, the author of the bestseller,
'Process the grieving process. "
My friend has inspired me.
Ryan Burk.
What do you give me a warm welcome!
I feel good and you?
Well.
Let me ask you a question.
Football fans are there?
One school team. Not so long ago,
lost their season opening game.
She went downhill very quickly,
but then something happened.
Thank you. An event that all
changed for the trainer.
The man began to sleep
in the office ...
pulled a strategy, studied the film.
He was there 24 hours a day doing.
They won the national championship.
After the excitement and champagne,
He went back home,
went upstairs to his cupboard,
and pulled his Browning emerged
double--barreled shotgun,
placed it against his chin,
and pulled the trigger.
The event that changed everything
at the beginning of the season was
his brother, his best friend,
who died of a heart attack.
You can climb back on your horse,
achieve great things,
You can even
National Championship meet.
But if you do not pay the piper,
he will come.
I want to thank each of you
courage to have to really feel,
the loss of loved ones.
I know it's not easy.
I've seen.
How are you?
Everything good?
We are fine.
-- Okay, one more time.
How are you?
-- Okay.
Okay, I see you at the workshop.
Yes, that's great.
Come on, relax a little.
Want a drink?
Maybe you need a drink? Waiter.
-- No thanks, please.
Chapter 12: Alcohol is not a cure,
for all the links on a bullet wound.
Okay, now let me see your sign.
Great. Give it once.
Great. Tell me what you motivated
By writing the book.
My wife is deceased.
I know.
Why not tell this to the world?
It was the way I myself
I coached to overcome.
I never meant that someone
it would read, but,
My agent gave it to a publisher,
and here I am.
Yes.
What happened?
We drove to a restaurant
for dinner.
A dog in the middle of the road,
The car hit a pole.
She died immediately.
It must have been terrible,
Sorry.
Thank you.
Well, I do what I need.
-- Fantastic.
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
-- Nice to meet you.
Take care.
Over here, guys.
Follow Burke. Come all.
The person who has entered the
morning section is a surprise.
Come on.
Excuse us.
Sorry.
Come here.
Come on, all
I want you here and look around me
tell what you see or hear.
Loraine.
-- Cars, cars honking.
Hammers.
-- Someone else?
Traffic lights. -- Cement.
-- A homeless.
Garbage.
-- Middle Fingers.
Well, great.
Remember this and follow me.
Well, what you see now?
Loraine?
-- The ocean.
Well.
-- Trees.
Antennas.
-- Skyscrapers.
Nobody here.
-- Rivers.
Beautiful rivers.
The Sun
-- Naked cover.
Everything looks different
above, right?
And yet the same.
We have gone anywhere else.
We just look at things
from a new perspective.
In each of you sit, sirens,
honking horns, road blocks,
but there is also this.
We just have to do the work,
and to climb the stairs to find it.
We have reporters in the afternoon,
I think you like her.
I do not give one damn about what you
cancellation policy is.
I leave and I want my money back.
Sir, it is not so easy.
Our cancellation policy,
Becky, what's the problem?
Mr. Ryan, this man refuses ...
Hi, I'm Burke.
And you are?
-- Walter Main Field.
Walter, where are you from?
-- Billings.
Montana, which is a long ride.
-- Yes.
Look, I do not think this is for me.
Okay, but may I ask why not.
Frankly, my sister
has persuaded me,
feeling that whole thing ...
I get it, may I ask why your sister
it was so important that you came here?
My son.
-- What is it?
Steven. -- What is ...
-- Does it really matter?
It makes me a little off, Walter,
I would like to hear.
Got a picture?
Sorry.
Walter, I know how you feel,
I've also experienced.
My wife died three years ago.
I want you to know that your first step
put you through that door to come
and there is something inside you, or you know
or not, so you came here.
If you want to go, we respect that.
I hope you do not.
Thanks, Becky.
Think about it.
Chapter Two: Happiness is
a mental state.
And like all things,
the exercise required.
Spend five minutes a day
to smile, just smile.
After a while, it will automatically go.
Sorry.
Hey, you forget your pen.
Guidnunc.
Quidnunc?
Curious Type:
A person who wants to know everything.
What can I pour?
I would have a seven to seven and,
a tomato
for my friend here.
Thank you.
As regards Unicoop.
I am close to a deal
with Time Warner to sign.
I expect the bid tomorrow
at lunch time.
That means, TV, radio,
publication, everything.
Are you also so happy for me
as I am for you?
Of course.
-- And listen.
Ted Vernon comes to the seminar itself.
I think there a nice and cozy
Contract party is, who knows?
You drink, gentlemen.
Thank you.
It is still a long way to your gigs
booking in Psychology Today, or not?
We'll look for a Learjet.
Learjet?
-- Lane, I have not written it.
You know you help people?
If not, friend?
This is your moment, you give yourself permission
give to enjoy them, brother.
Come on, man, live a little.
What?
You're right.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Do you remember me? From the lobby,
above. You let your pen.
Want a cup of coffee?
Well, you can take him if you want,
that doubles the fun.
Sorry, I ...
Hi, sweetie, how are you?
-- Hello.
I was close so I thought,
I bring you your lunch.
Because you work so hard.
You should not do that again.
-- Are you ready?
How would your boss lately?
That is good.
-- It sounds so good, Paul.
Look at that.
A mature sound.
Have you had visitors?
Yes, I told you that Frank and I
worked last night.
Used Frank lipstick.
Listen, it's not what you think.
It is business.
You said the last time al
-- Hey, she is an acquaintance of Sonia.
Listen to me, Eloise.
-- I want to hear.
What is your name?
-- Andrew.
See you at the workshop.
You owe me one of them.
Would you like to sign?
For Donald and Shirley, please.
Please.
-- Let me tell you something?
There was a man of about sixty one years.
He thought he might
would enjoy his retirement,
but when on one days, three years and 13 days
ago, his daughter dies.
And the truth is that he is not good
them is handled.
He does not sleep much.
And he and his wife ...
You understand.
But the husband of his daughter seems
one of these problems to have.
She was crushed in
a car accident, but he
He makes lemonade from lemons.
You know how that goes.
If you keep on lying, son?
Hypocritical.
Burke, I am so sorry.
Fuck him.
-- I'm okay.
Who does he think he is?
-- Her father.
Even so, he wrote about.
Forget that. You know what?
She would be proud of you.
Okay, you're mad at me.
Thousands of times you said 'no'
against Seattle and I did not listen.
You must be mad at me.
I'm fine.
Burke.
See you tonight, at eight hours.
A big kiss.
I love you.
Well, my ass is not on the cover
of Cosmo.
You think I am not a good
animal friend can be?
Are you afraid of my cerebral cortex,
delicious dish that ...
Or maybe you're just afraid of my
Battery driven by sex.
What do you think?
Hello.
-- There is something wrong with that girl.
She wanted to hear.
Marty, poetry is for the cafe.
My shop work.
Please.
-- Of course.
Were there any bills?
The Burke appointment, I told you about.
-- Yes.
Marty, you do not cut off the stems.
I just wanted to do.
This is done differently.
The juice contaminate the water,
and then they die twice as fast.
I know.
-- You must understand.
In roses we have all these ...
These flowers drink from the water.
Are you okay?
-- I've had a few bad days, right?
You want to talk to me?
-- No, I do not.
The last time you were not so angry when
I had forgotten to cut them off.
And a fan.
-- Again?
Yes
-- No!
No!
-- I know, crazy.
I can not believe it.
You know what? Yes, I think so,
I can imagine me.
Sorry, what do you mean?
-- It is so clear to me.
It means that you choose men,
ensuring that,
We finally come to stand again
and the same conversation as now.
And you will be surprised by the result
of that relationship, again.
The worst is, I hate you so
disappointed and hurt all the time.
Am I too strict?
-- Yes, no.
I ...
-- Cutting.
It is because you feel the pain and resentment.
I want you to read chapter twelve.
The cigarette is simply not
more than a habit.
They are a means of denial.
Mental health starts with ...
-- Physical health.
And as you always say that it is important
for people to remember,
how they lived,
not how they died.
Well, my husband held
My cereal biscuits,
So I took his ashes and,
discover my Stanley.
See not delicious.
See you at the workshop.
There is an event next week
in the small salon,
and Julie wants to know if ...
-- Excuse me.
Oh, my God, you're cured.
Do you like people to kid
keep you're Helen Keller?
Technically, she was blind,
So ...
Please forgive us.
Thank you.
Listen, I know a few things
about people.
You will often approached, since you probably already
first walked on the sports field.
But you are smart and creative
and loving, deep,
but how is it that men only
the outside see what comes?
Sure, you feel flattered,
but ultimately it is tiring,
because it has nothing to do with you,
if you're born, you had nothing to do.
But inside, it is yours.
That's what you really want someone sees.
Even a stranger.
So you do if you are disabled,
instead of a call
with another man to go.
Would you rather sign language?
Well.
Smoothly, very smoothly.
Sorry, this is the men's toilet.
No sorry.
What did you have in mind?
A sweet and romantic courtship
we make love in the glow of
a porn movie in a hotel room.
I regret that your ego
is hurt.
But you know what? I bet the next
woman you met in the elevator,
or maybe in the gym,
will very well meet that description,
even if you have a wife
those stupid enough to,
to think that you are the only, the
only man with integrity, the only,
until a lipstick stain
to find your underwear.
And then the game is over boyfriend.
And the one thing that you have so appreciated
you loved so much,
is stained, ruined, destroyed,
just.
Therefore, if you had brains
in one of those two heads,
you would realize that
I us both a favor granted.
Excuse me.
-- Sure, no problem.
Is my flower you wearing?
-- No.
Yes, indeed.
I took it before I thought
you deaf.
Not that I would steal a deaf.
Goodbye.
This is done.
-- Who ordered that?
No idea. He said you knew
where it should go.
Quidnunc.
Eating out?
I will help.
-- Thank you. Chic.
That took years.
That's good to know.
-- Yes.
It has stopped raining.
-- Yes.
Carrot with ginger and spinach soup.
I must say that I've never
Gedat with someone,
living large on a cardboard sign said.
They are good to carpool.
I get it.
You know, together we make a long
walk along the beach,
go kiting.
He is the kite.
Because he is cardboard.
Your salads.
Bon appetit.
So?
You look a little pinched with eyes?
Yes. You had really
should not see.
They are just words.
So, is there more than one?
Well, you called concierge.
That is a good one.
Thank you.
-- Sure.
I have to go it's evening school, so ...
I understand.
-- I have a great evening, thank you.
Thanks for everything.
-- Bye.
I've been three years no more dates.
I was married and,
I usually always
courteous and correct.
What word is even impressed
on you would make.
But now I'm down a little rusted.
Why did not you before?
I try desperately to the last
shred of masculinity to hold.
So, I am the first
since you're divorced.
You're the first ...
-- Well, because it explains a lot.
Because that in there ...
Was it bad?
-- Very bad.
I need to go orchids
Picking want with me?
Yes.
-- Good.
Personally I do the waffles and bacon
there like the first.
I raise the PH level.
Well, do your thing.
I find myself still wondering what your thing is.
Then you should read my book.
-- What are you a smooth Janus.
I'd rather mysterious.
How long you been doing this?
-- This is what I always wanted to do.
Eventually after some courage
I had the courage to open my shop.
Julie, we have never met ...
Do not.
-- I'm sorry.
These are orders.
Are the copies I make of the
maps. They have stayed with me.
Can I?
Julie, we have never met,
but,
I love you observed. Congratulations
and a fine wedding wished.
Love, your father.
Can I?
Stacey, this would have to last 2 weeks,
I'll be back to
to see them flourish.
That sailor, they will never
seen in bloom.
Look this over.
My dearest wife happy 50th wedding
sorry for the bruises from last night.
I see before me.
Life in a nutshell.
If the candle of truth,
I must be honest.
I have her money
using life insurance,
for a deposit
at a flat in Mexico.
We had previously discussed.
He thought it a good idea.
So I made a mold of his you know.
If he were or were not
We still ... you know?
Who is next?
Walter?
Not much to tell.
Walter, there is always something to say.
Tell us.
How did your son?
I had my contractor and he was right.
He was better than I shed a
in the garden make.
On one days I had some drawings collection
on one of the pits from my trailer.
I told him to wait in the car.
But he fell and broke his spine.
So it went.
So it went.
Every day.
Every day,
I should have known that he
not in the car would continue.
Walter, you said you were contractor.
I can not even a
hardware store run
I now make cleaning buildings at night.
I lost my case.
My wife left me.
Thank you, Walter.
There is a dirty little secret.
The fear.
How many of you fly anymore?
Put your hands on.
Who here is an annual survey
3 times a year?
Which of you do not go in lifts, skiing,
cycling, surfing, kayaking?
Fear is a mental state.
And we now show.
An applause everyone.
Here we go.
Come on, Nathalie.
The fear is only in your head.
Come on, Walter.
Come on, Walter.
Here we go.
It is good.
-- This is crazy.
I'm not because I feel better about
I walked glowing coals.
Well, it would not so great
thing should be, Walter.
No that is not.
-- It is a step, an important step.
It has nothing to do with my Steven
making.
Walter, Steven would want the business so
were or would he want you went through,
to put one step forward?
You knew my son at all.
Walter, look.
Walter, come.
Come on, Walter, you can.
Come on.
Well, we do it
at our own pace.
He will get there.
Let us give ourselves a round of applause.
We give the fear a trap,
where it hurts.
This will hurt.
How many layers of skin do you
you have?
Not enough.
You can not work for them.
You know that.
-- That man needs help.
Well. But you can not do for him.
This will be stinging.
Are you ready?
On three.
A ..
Lane, you're fired.
Once you sign with us
an independent entrepreneur.
Then you have our 32 divisions you

We guarantee that your brand

This forms the basis of a strategy
which allows to intercept ...

You look strong and happy.
This is a sample.
We go by.
Remember that if Mr Vernon
comes to town ...
Hi, I have them along to the museum should
take, and they like an idiot around.
Was that beep?
Hi, Burke. It's me, Eloise.
Where are we going?
That you see.
I'll be back.
Is that your house?
-- No, my mother.
I need to retrieve something.
You may be inside.
-- Good.
Bob has placed the keys on the counter.
Great. How was your day?
I had a lot of coupons.
-- Really? Busy, huh?
I have brought flowers.
They are beautiful, thank you.
Mom, I've brought a friend.
-- I expected no visitors.
Hi, I'm Burke.
Ryan Burke.
-- Yes.
Ely, I knew you were out
with a celebrity.
We will not ...
You could say I
'm not.
On the contrary, I can see where Eloise
her appearance is.
Let him see your photos.
-- That seems to be a bad idea.
Yes, fun.
I find the keys.
Look, Pocahontas.
Eloise was 2 years long archery champion.
Mama.
Do not be so modest

Is not it nice when you do not know.
You'll see.
Try to dodge the FBI?
You'll see.
Please, get in the truck.
I forget my helmet safety.

-- Come on, let me show you see.
Really? I was in that bucket?
Yes, trust me.
Do you have swallowed drugs
today?
Beware. Very dangerous.
Door.
You know what you doing?
Are you in?
Locked and loaded.
And there is Ryan Burke, dead.
Stop it, Bob gave me a crash course
morning.
Who is Bob? That is my life
in his hands.
A neighbor of my mother,
her current boyfriend.
I thought so, I want something back
for last night.
I wanted to go to the concert, but the
tickets were sold out for weeks.
So I thought, where is a will,
is one way.
If I had a dime for every time
I saw a concert,
I would really ...
Thank you.
It was great.
-- Thank me, thank Bob.
Thanks, Bob.
I got your book.
I am halfway.
-- Really?
Wait until you reach the 'rescue section
come, are great.
Sorry about your wife.
Why not tell me
what happened?
That has never been discussed.
According loved you much.
Yes, that's right.
That was long ago.
Three years?
21 in dog years.
I had a great time.
I found it fun.
What?
I'm ready to see you
to walk back to your truck.
Day.
Is that song for the international
"You fucked?
No, hardly.
Come on, tell me
what happened last night?
It was fun.
Will you agree with him again?
-- I do not know. Maybe.
You're just 72 hours ago
formed with Tyler,
Now go out with someone who is not 72 hours
in the city? Can I ask?
Okay, we are not.
We have just met.
You know, I like him.
We just go out together.
Be careful.
Thanks for that.
poppysmic: Sound produced
by the smack of the lips.
Give me 2 minutes.
He was called away for
an emergency.
Her eyes were the color with freckles
of mermaid tears.
Her ears awoke to the sound
of children playing.
You and your phallus, these world
then manage,
but this girl will amazon
you in pieces.
Thank you.
Great.
Go on.
Drink?
-- Go on a tour of me.
Do you have more of that Sambuca?
Want to try?
Excuse me.
I beg you.
Take it wisely.
I just enjoy the local flavor.
-- When you enjoy something from?
How did you actually find me?
-- I'm Marshall Lane.
Your concierge told me.
-- What's going on here?
We make the deal of the century,
and you play the prince of Persia.
Drink, gentlemen?
-- Go away.
No thanks.
-- Can you calm down again?
I can not calm down.
Their manager is about two days.
Do you know how much blood sweat and tears the
I took to do it they get?
Six months ago she knew
not even your name.
I know and I appreciate it.
I do really.
-- You do not.
Friend to Friend ...
Would not you?
You can tell me.
I'm done.
You're so over the next few days,
when I say that you should be?
Yes, your honor.
Can you relax?
You get a heart attack.
That I had.
Four pieces on the way here.
Who are those people that you
uitbent them?
People I've met.
-- Yes?
She called Eloise.
-- Asjemenou. Details?
She is ...
-- Yes?
That's great.
Yes.
I must return.
-- We can do better.
Fine to have met you.
It is tragic.
You were so young, it is so sad.
How can you daily with death
deal?
There you anyway
handle.
I think a show funerals
, and it is a waste of money.
In fact, a funeral
important ritual in the grieving process.
Not only recognize
that a life ended.
But also recognize that
there is a life lived.
At the funeral of my wife ...
-- You do not have to tell.
No, it's good.
It was here in Seattle.
It was a feast. It was a beautiful day
In March, St. Patricks day,
her family has a plot, so
We put chairs ready, and candles,
two weeks and had rained, it poured,
and that day the sun rose,
the dahlias bloom
as if she welcomed her.
It was amazing.
It was healing for my family.
Dahlias?
Dahlias.
Dahlias were her favorite flowers.
Dahlias bloom not
until the autumn.
Perhaps they were earlier that year.
It's late.
We must go, Burke.
He is not gone, do you?
No.
It is so beautiful here.
Look, there is the house of my parents.
There. Okay, your turn.
Laugh. Time for tourists who photograph.
There is a red button on here.
You do not laugh.
Would you please smile?
Three, two, one.
Healing begins with acceptance, Olivia.
I think you're well on our way.
Who's next? Someone?
Here are those intended for small sessions.
Come on people, join us.
Martha, please.
I do not know.
-- Martha, I do not know, brings you nowhere.
This is your session.
Make the most of it.
I think my anger
a little under control.
I try not to project onto others.
-- Work at it in the afternoon group.
The next, anyone?
Come on, people.
You, Walter?
I think I get a lot from the seminar.
-- Like what?
Come on, there is no good answer here.
Open yourselves.
Well, it's just that,
it still hurts.
-- That is a given, Walter.
What are you going there to do?
I try.
-- No, not really trying.
I do not know how to do that?
-- You do not know how to do that?
Am I not been the last
three days. Have not you heard?
Do you not know, Walter?
-- No, I ...
Pour it out.
What is it?
Do you know?
He was now in the 'little league'
to play.
If he had stayed in the car,
He would play video games,
would paint his skateboard, he would fiercely me
through a child.
But he will never do that,
because it lies in a coffin.
You're stuck.
You could not advance your eyes because you
in the rear have.
The death of your son
has become your death.
Your marriage, your job, everything.
I do not know how I again
can get back.
You're a contractor, right?
One stone at a time.
Only one step.
A small trip today.
Follow me.
Around the corner.
Thank you.
Customize your step.
Having problems?
I'm not going out.
I can not go outside.
Walter, you're not a night watchman.
You're a contractor.
After you.
Driving it.
Good people, come on.
I get a kick out of here.
Thanks, you me
reminded.
You yourself are reminded, Walter.
I could not hold him.
At the end, I could not hold him.
The doctors told him
not move, so ...
I want you to get it.
A beautiful boy, Walter.
If you ever have grown to ...
I'll be right there.
I'm not at her funeral.
And since then I have not
talked with her parents.
I have not made Rocky.
I did not talk with her friends.
I even threw away things that
her smoking.
I tried not to judge
or you in the trap.
Can I say something?
And I say this out of humility.
Knowing that my life day
one experiment per day.
And very bad decisions.
But,
you've really messed up.
Maybe you need someone compels you,
to those things that you do not want.
As with her parents talk, or,
for Rocky to ensure
then who it is.
What is Rocky?
-- A parrot.
A parrot.
-- Her parrot.
He is very noisy and he shit
under the house.
A parrot.
She made me promise that if ever
something would happen to her,
I ... This sounds strange.
-- What?
I would release him.
That you did not, right?
-- No.
No, her parents have taken him.
You said her parents lived here?
Two birds with one stone, come on.
-- Eloise.
No, because ...
Her father ...
It's just complicated.
I know it's complicated.
-- I am sure that it is very complicated.
Eloise, no.
That is it.
-- There it is.
Should I go with you or ...
-- I do not think it falls on good soil.
I do not know if they are home.
If he wants to keep the bird now?
Burke!
Have I mentioned that her father
an ex--marine is?
That's right. Guess who?
Never thought you would see you again.
Shall I pour tea again?
What happened to you on?
What happens?
What is it, dear?
-- I talk to Rocky.
Tease him now.
-- I plague him.
He does again
like a car alarm.
Honey, can you address some lemon?
-- What?
Can you address some lemon?
-- Yes, here it is ... Shut up.
Now do not you cut yourself again.
-- I cut myself, no worries.
Go!
What happens?
-- Now it.
Ride.
-- I al
Get out.
Hurry.
I have the bird, which is important.
-- Were they so upset?
That they are.
-- What?
What happened to
"two birds with one stone?
I could just to. They would
never have given me the bird.
You do not know.
-- I have eggs for my money for.
If they wanted the bird released
was, as it happens.
That's no animal cruelty?
It was not my idea, it was your idea.
-- It was not my idea, it was her idea.
But let him decide.
It seems a good place.
Come on Rocky, fly away.
Come on. Out.
Go see the world,
learn to know a few girls.
Come on, get out.
No, Rock, go.
Come here.
Fly away.
Rock, look at me.
Hurry.
Okay, now you made me pissed.
Do you live in a dorm?
You know what? You are there alone.
How did it go?
-- Mission accomplished.
Was he happy?
Are you happy?
It's a bird.
I have him released.
Can you bring me back to the hotel?
I feel better by doing.
Listen, you do not
talking about if you do not want.
Tell me what to say.
-- No.
I do not know, I'm here
not considered.
Look, I like you. I like you.
Not the author, not the man with the
microphone and I just want to help.
Look, you know what?
I must return to the hotel.
Now and I think you should respect that.
I want, but ...
-- You do not know when to stop, do you?
I ask you to stop
and you will continue.
Maybe you do need psychoanalysis.
Leave me alone.
I'll go back alone.
It was time.
Where have you been?
-- Not important.
Let me tell you something
what is important.
You ruined dinner and Vernon
here, you should ...
Lane.
I talk with him tomorrow, care
Meanwhile, for him,
Meanwhile you accept their offer,
but tell them,
that the DVD was too late
I would wait until next Mon
What happened to you, man?
-- I can not wait to leave the city.
You gonna be okay?
-- Absolutely.
Has something happened this afternoon?
-- Not particularly.
What happened to Eloise?
Stop.
Wait. Listen to me.
You know, you can talk to me.
If you want to.
I know I throw everything together since I
care of the matter, but I want you to know
I'm here if you need me.
She's gone.
-- What do you mean?
I do not know.
I blew it.
I have all my junk
thrown in her face.
Something can be.
Burke.
-- Good night. Tomorrow is the big day.
Burke.
Burke.
You've really screwed up.
She hit a pole,
and she died instantly.
If you keep on lying, son?
Good morning, here.
What happened?
-- I walked around a bit. Fresh air.
Vernon, went to the international
and demonstration DVD.
Old men want to be seen
and we are Rolls Royce.
But first things first,
you just need someone to shake hands.
Lane's death, Marshall.
This is unexpected.
I'm sorry.
Lane told me.
The truth.
You deserve what you
calling yourself.
I hope you can anyway one way
find yourself a chance.
Because if you do not, then
This is your life.
I just think it's
sad.
That is sad ...
I just wanted to say.
Please just take care.
Was this one weeks of miracles, or not?
How many of you can not
get enough of Ryan Burke?
I bet you like him,
every day from 3 to 4 hours
in your living room to see,
on the local television stations.
Here it is, Ryan Burke.
Thank you. Please go down.
Thank you, please scroll down.
I feel good, and you?
-- Great.
Sir, I must see your ticket. -- What?
-- Your ticket.
I have a ticket.
That damn thief. Someone broke in and took ...
Here is your ticket. -- You can keep it.
You keep it.
We have a great progress
made in recent days.
Remember,
are the only foundations
for the future.
Sorry.
Do u. ..
I'm sorry.
I can not lie to you.
I stand here,
and watch your confrontation with the pain.
And I envy you.
I am not mine
face.
I did not think it was my fault.
The accident of my wife.
It rained.
There was a dog.
In the middle of the road.
We had a fight.
About the colors of paint
for the kitchen.
Colors of paint.
But I have not told,
it was me who steered the car.
They do not.
I've killed my wife.
I am so sorry.
It was just an accident, son.
That's all it was.
You had nothing to do.
It is true.
It was one of those bizarre accidents.
Listen to me. We have
never blamed.
Never.
We were just together
mourn with you, son.
We did not know what to do,
We could not find you.
That was the worst.
It is good.
I had long ago you
have to do.
Are you okay?
-- Yes, it takes time.
Mr. Ryan? Ted Vernon.
That was impressive.
Yes, that was impressive.
That was the reality.
And if you do not accept it for what
it is, then you can deal in the ass stabbing.
I found it refreshing.
And I respect you for it.
Thank you.
Sorry, we are still ...
-- We shall see.
Reason to fire you know me always.
I'll be back. Mr. Vernon?
There is something I think you feel
that have not yet realized.
As we were, we not only
our daughter, but also lost our son.
Sorry.
-- We understand.
They would want you
continue with your life.
And be no stranger. Ensure the following
time that you use the front door.
I will, I promise.
And, son, thank you. Thank you.
I had to do that long ago.
-- It's not over.
You got me that damn bird
redeemed.
I love you, boy.
-- I love you.
I told you what you asked for beach grass.
-- Great, thanks. Hello.
The thing is,
the last days you have the part
me know,
not really available.
So, I asked myself whether I
not too much ruined me.
If you would be interested in,
the part of me to know,
it is available.
Yes, she wants.
Sorry.
Yes.
Chapter 15.
During your trip, it is important
one thing to keep in mind.
As one thing ends, another begins.
Are you?
Yeah, who would otherwise be.
Come on.
I wonder where you were out.
Not that I matter.
Back to the salt mines boy.
Hello.
-- Hello.
Hello.
-- Hello.
Goodbye.
