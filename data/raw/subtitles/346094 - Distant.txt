DISTANT
Mahmut, it's Mom.
I called earlier, but you were out.
Take care.
Are you looking for someone?
Does Mahmut Ozdemir live here?
Yes, he lives here.
I'm a relative of his from back home.
Did you ring the bell?
There's no answer.
Sometimes the bell shorts out.
Do you think he went out?
I didn't see him leave.
Good morning, Kamil.
Good morning.
Could you accept a package for me?
Sometimes they won't let me
sign for it.
Please try anyway.
Of course.
Kamil.
Yes?
Go buy the things on the list.
Right now?
Yes. I've got some cooking to do.
All right.
Hurry up.
Yusuf?
Sorry, I completely forgot
you were coming.
That's okay. No problem.
What's the news?
Back home, everybody's the same.
Do you still work at the factory?
The economic crisis put the factory
out of business.
My father was dismissed. Then me.
There's no work at all now.
How many people lost their job?
A thousand.
That's a whole town full of people!
It sure is.
What will you do on the ship?
I'll work as a cabin boy.
Or a steward.
I'll do whatever job
they've got for me.
Sailors make a lot of money.
Money in US dollars.
And you see the world.
There's no economic
crisis at sea.
The dollars make up
for the inflation.
It may not be that easy.
You'll be away on long journeys.
Can you take that
kind of loneliness?
Have you thought about that?
You know I like to travel.
But the main thing is to earn money.
That's why I'm here.
I also want to travel!
You've been everywhere,
so why not me?
Every place ends up
looking the same.
How many days before
you find a job?
I don't know exactly.
You said about a week on the phone.
I guess it'll take a week or so.
Yeah, about a week.
At night, be careful
of the mouse glue strip.
If you step on it,
you'll be stuck there all night.
And don't use the toilet in the
bathroom. Use the other one.
The one by the entrance?
Yes.
And we only smoke in the kitchen.
OK then, good night.
Good night.
Come this way.
Hello.
Is this where the freighters come in?
They dock here but
the offices are in Karakoy.
They dock here?
Yes, they do.
But the offices are in Karakoy.
So I can't get a job
directly on board?
No. Go to the shipping agents
on Monday.
I'll come. You set it up.
The thing is, I'm coming
with someone.
No, he is someone
from my hometown.
Will any girls be coming?
Great.
OK.
We'll be there.
See you tomorrow.
Hi.
Welcome back.
God, it's cold!
It's so late.
I was getting worried.
God, the snow is bad.
How could you go out
in this weather?
My socks are soaked.
Can I dry them on the radiator?
Yes, you can.
How'd the job hunting go?
Well, I went down to the port.
I'll dry my shoes, too.
All right.
It seems you don't find jobs
at the port.
I was told to go to
Karakoy on Monday.
I walked around Eminonu.
I'd better put on a new
pair of socks.
Money doesn't make you
happy any more.
And I think you're looking
for your past here.
You're rambling.
Maybe. But have you already forgotten...
...our climb to the
summit of Reshko to get...
...a better shot of the White Valley?
You used to say then you'd make
films like Tarkovsky.
So why are you trying
to forget those days?
Photography is finished, man.
No, it's not.
The mountains, too.
Maybe it's you who's done for.
You're announcing your death
before it's happened.
You don't have the right
to bury your ideals...
...or make everything commercial.
Hey, Arif,
where are the chicks?
They all backed out.
What do you mean?
We've reserved the whole Sunday.
Where are they?
Not here. At the cinema
or wherever. Fuck it.
You're weaseling out of it again.
Photography or women.
Which do you prefer?
I prefer photography.
Come on. Photography is dead.
This fits here normally.
But it's too loose.
Tell your mother
to wrap some tape here.
Hello.
There's a package. Shall I get it now?
Please.
If you want, I'll wait for it.
Okay.
For the love of God.
We can't find anything
once we've put it down.
Here it is.
Thanks.
Good evening.
Good evening to you, too.
There's also a problem
with the dust bag.
Let's go to your house to show
your mother how to attach it.
I think I'd better go to bed.
Okay.
Good night. See you tomorrow.
Good night.
Could you close the door?
Hi Mom, what are you up to?
Is your toothache better?
Why don't you let that old tooth puller
Nuri take care of it?
Cause Mahmut's sleeping...
I am sure Nuri gives credit.
I'll pay it once I earn it.
Tell him.
What are you ashamed of?
Yeah, so I've been around.
I was told to go to Karak√∂y
on Monday.
What did Dad do?
There's no chance the factory
will take him back.
He should stop kidding himself.
They always say that.
Anyway, I've got to hang up.
Stop putting off that tooth,
Mom. OK?
I'll call you again. Good night.
Can I take the magazine
over there?
I'll turn on the light for a second.
It's late. Let's turn that off.
Good night.
Good night.
Do you know where
the sailors' coffeehouse is?
Behind that hilltop.
May I sit here?
At your age, I thought the same.
But listen.
I've worked on the ships for
months now. And I have nothing.
I never could send any money home.
I am broke just like Tarzan.
Listen to me. There's no work
and no money on the ships.
Forget it while you're still ahead.
It's an empty dream.
Hi.
Come on in, Yusuf.
It's snowing like crazy.
Where were you till now?
I was trying to
find a job. You know.
So what happened?
Well, some said they would call me.
Others told me to come back
or that they'd think about it.
What are you doing?
What can I do? Surfing around...
Is there a problem with the job?
No. There's no problem.
It looks like they want someone
to act as a guarantor.
No guarantor, no job.
That's easy enough.
You can take care of that.
But I don't know anybody
in Istanbul.
I don't know what to do.
There was something here.
I just can't seem to...
The God damned thing
has 50 channels
but there's only shit!
What a rip off. Look at that!
I want to call home.
Can I use the phone?
All right.
The phone in the back room.
OK, go use it.
He refused to give us any credit?
What a bastard!
When I get back,
I'll punch him real good.
I'll punch out
his teeth one by one.
Anyway, forget about it.
I'll send you some money
as soon as I get a job.
Mahmut's going to Anatolia
to take pictures
and he says I should go with him.
If he gives me money,
I'll send it to you.
Then you throw that money
in that bastard's face.
Okay, take care.
That fucking mouse!
"Our agency has no current need
for ship personnel."
Hello. I'm looking for
a job on a ship.
There're no jobs.
All right. Thanks anyway.
So, it's Canada?
Orhan got a very good offer.
We don't want to miss
this opportunity.
When are you leaving?
In two or three weeks.
By New Year, we'll be in a new country
starting a new life.
It's hard.
It's not so hard when you don't have that
much to leave behind.
We spent a lot of money
on doctors.
That's one reason
to sell the house.
We can settle that.
But I keep thinking about that baby matter.
How can they be sure it happened
because of the abortion you got?
They just say the abortion is
the most probable reason.
I was three months pregnant
if you remember?
I remember.
But we were about to get divorced.
That's why I didn't want it.
I'm not blaming you. Really.
Don't worry about it.
You should see a doctor in Canada.
I still doubt that one abortion
can cause infertility.
We didn't believe it either at first.
We went to different doctors.
But that's the way it is.
I've resigned myself actually
but it's hard for Orhan.
He really likes children.
I told him we could separate.
He doesn't want to.
