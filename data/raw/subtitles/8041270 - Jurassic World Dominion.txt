-MAN: Oh, my God.
GEMMA:
It's been three decades
since the deadly events
at Jurassic Park,
and we've yet to find a way
for these animals
to live safely among us.
After the devastating eruption
of Isla Nublar's
long-dormant volcano,
those who survived were
transported to the mainland.
Many of the larger predators
were captured,
but the remaining creatures
scattered here
in Big Rock National Park.
While most remained in the wild,
those who made their way
to civilization
struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions.
Local authorities have warned
the animals are unpredictable
and, when hungry,
extremely violent.
As the dinosaurs spread
across borders,
-a global black market has
risen. -MAN: They're not ours.
Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!
GEMMA: To combat the growing
threat of illegal poachers,
the U.S. Congress awarded
sole collection rights
to the global giant
Biosyn Genetics.
At Biosyn, we're dedicated
to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.
GEMMA: CEO Lewis Dodgson
has created a sanctuary
in Italy's Dolomite Mountains,
where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs'
ancient immune systems
for unique
pharmaceutical properties.
While Biosyn believes
we can handle
genetic power responsibly,
the public remains skeptical.
Some note that these
government contracts have led
to massive spikes
in Biosyn's profits.
And rumors persist
of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared,
leading to a worldwide search.
Some believe she's
genetically identical
to Charlotte Lockwood,
deceased daughter
of Jurassic Park cofounder
Benjamin Lockwood.
Now that we've brought these
animals back from extinction...
Are we responsible for them?
Or should they be left
to fend for themselves?
As we adapt to
an ever-changing world,
we must find answers
to these questions--
for their safety
as well as for our own.

You're way too important,
Maisie.

MAISIE:
You took her, too.
Yeah.
We needed her
to help us understand you.
MAISIE:
Hey, Beta.
You okay?
Did you say "Beta"?
Is that her name?
I gave it to her.
HENRY:
Beta's pretty special.
You know, when we made Blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA
to fill in the gaps
in her genome.
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate,
so Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,
and that's what they have
in common with you and...
Charlotte.
What do you know
about Charlotte?
She died.
A long time ago.
It broke my grandpa's heart.
So he made me.
No, Maisie, actually, he didn't.
Charlotte made you.
I'm so excited for everyone to
see what we've been doing here.
There's new technology
being made, new science,
like, every day almost.
And it's great to be...
it's great to be
in the center...
center of that.
HENRY: Charlotte lived
on Site B with all of us.
Till the storm.
She loved dinosaurs.
HENRY (on video):
Charlotte, be careful.
Yeah, I will.
HENRY:
She grew up around scientists.
Then, eventually...
...she became one herself.
A butterfly flew into
my office this morning.
They say tiny things
have huge impacts,
and I agree wholeheartedly.
She was brilliant.
In ways that I'll never be.
In the metaphysics of identity,
can a replica
truly be the original?
And if it's possible,
what makes it so?
I've lost my pen.
Is that me?
Yeah. (chuckles)
Just like Blue,
Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.
She created you
with her own DNA.
So I do have a mother.
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.
He was protecting her and you.
And we're the same?
You were.
When you were a baby,
Charlotte started
to show symptoms
of a genetic disorder.
That's how she died.
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.
Do I have it, too?
No.
She changed your DNA.
She altered every cell
in your body
to eradicate this disease.
No one on earth has ever
known how to do that.
She fixed me.
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.
Your DNA could change the world.
And I have to know
how she did it,
but I just can't
replicate her work.
If I could just study you
and Beta, whose DNA
was never changed, I could...
...fix a terrible mistake
that I've made.
What kind of mistake?
