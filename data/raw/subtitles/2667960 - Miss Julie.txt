"She had received
a most beautiful doll.
As a present.
Oh, what a glorious doll,
so fair and delicate.
She did not seem created.
For the sorrows of this world."
mommy.
Mommy.
Diana.
Took the baron to the train.
Funny, miss julie
isn't going with him.
I mean, all their friends are
celebrating midsummer together,
Big event.
Left me his boots to polish.
Changed into something
more fancy,
His fanciness,
His most divine fanciness,
His vainglorious,
most elegant highness.
Sir boots, I think.
So the baron went into the
station and told me to wait,
Said he'd have
something for me.
When I see him
come out of the station,
He was putting something
in a folder.
Guess what was in the folder.
A packet of travel brochures.
Like that's how
someone like me travels.
But no money, no.
They don't think that
way, not those people.
No, they don't think that way.
And then I leave and I'm
carrying his boots.
And I pass the barn and ask the
stable boy to take the horses home.
And I go in.
And there I see miss
julie leading the dance.
With the gamekeeper...
the gamekeeper.
And what do you know? She sees me and
she rushes over to me, kathleen,
And commands me, kathleen...
commands me to dance with her.
She thinks she can
control everyone.
Who am I?
I can't control anything.
Oh, kathleen, come and look
at these pictures.
Look, paris.
Rome.
This is lake como.
Oh, I know about that place.
Lord, it's lovely.
I'm hungry.
It's kidney, your favorite.
Delightful.
Yes, you are right.
This is my big délice.
You should have
warmed my plate.
You're harder to please
than the baron himself.
Get me a glass.
A proper one, a fancy one.
When one is drinking bon vin...
Oh.
It's good. It's pretty good.
It's a tiny bit too cold.
What are you cooking
with that infernal smell?
Oh, just some devil the young lady
has me making up for the dog.
Miss julie thinks
it's pregnant again,
Because she's been,
ah, you know,
Close to the gamekeeper's dog.
Miss julie told me
she watched them.
And it made her sick.
And now she'd rather risk the
dog die from the remedy.
Than have a mixed breed.
God save her.
You should have seen her
coming to the dance.
Looked like she'd been lying
on the ground having a nap.
We wouldn't act in that way.
But still, she's elegant...
Miss julie...
Magnificent.
Oh, her waist, her neck.
Stop it.
I've heard clara talking.
She's seen her naked.
Lots of times.
When she gives her a bath...
Oh, clara...
Too cross-eyed
to get anything right.
You women, you're always
jealous of each other.
Listen, I, who have been
out riding with her...
I know her well enough...
The way she sits a
horse, her legs,
And then the way she dances.
Well,
Is it done...
My abortive poison?
Is it some kind of
witches' broth.
You ladies are cooking
on midsummer eve, huh?
Listen.
Come, dance with me again.
I don't want to be impolite,
But I have promised
to dance with kathleen.
Let me borrow him, kathleen.
You go and rest.
If miss julie is so gracious,
It isn't for him to say no.
Go along, john.
Be thankful for the honor.
Frankly speaking,
But not wishing
to offend in any way,
I cannot help wondering
if it's wise.
For miss julie to dance twice
with the same partner.
What are you talking about?
I, the mistress of the house,
honor the workers' dance,
In the barn, with my presence.
Since I really want to dance,
I have to dance with someone
who knows the steps,
So I don't look ridiculous.
As you command, miss julie.
I am at your service.
I have chosen
to forget all rank,
And so must you.
Come, give me your arm.
Thank you, john.
I really don't want to
treat you as an inferior.
Let us go through
the entrance hall.
You would like that,
wouldn't you?
Don't be afraid, kathleen.
I won't run away
with your fiancé.
That's what he is, isn't he?
You're a man of the future,
aren't you?
Diana, come here.
Come on.
My love, come here. Come here.
Poor you.
I know.
I did not put very much
in your food.
It's mostly good meat.
You'll be fine.
Shh.
Listen.
You like it?
You stay here.
I left her.
She's strange, kathleen.
She's always strange.
Are you upset with me?
Why?
For small things like the
two of you walking off?
You are a sensible girl,
Kathleen.
You'll make a good wife.
Can you imagine
what the baron would say.
If he saw her behavior?
Huh? Did you see her?
See her?
Is it possible?
Are you flattered?
Don't be another dog, will you?
You are such a charming
cavalier,
Running away from a lady.
As you can see,
I hurried back.
To be with the lady
I had deserted.
Why are you wearing your
livery on midsummer night?
Remove it at once.
Then I must ask
if I can go to my room.
My black coat is hanging there.
Go to your room then.
And I will go too,
and make sure.
You don't run away
from me again.
Miss julie,
with your permission,
May I go and get it?
Kathleen,
Are you and john engaged?
Engaged?
You seem so familiar.
In a way. We call it that.
You call it that?
Were you not engaged
yourself, miss julie?
Miss julie,
I am tired.
Would you mind if I go
to my room and...?
Where did you learn
to speak french?
In switzerland.
I was the wine waiter at the one
of the biggest hotels in lucerne.
You look like
a perfect gentleman.
Charmant.
- You flatter me.
- Why would I flatter you?
Oh, well, my natural modesty
forbids me to believe.
That you would give
someone like me.
Such genuine compliments,
And so I dare to assume
that you were flattering me,
Or worse, patronizing me.
Where did you learn
to talk like that?
You'd be surprised.
To know the places
I have visited.
But you were born
in this area, weren't you?
Aye.
My father worked the land
right across the way.
And I visited your garden.
Long before I came
to work for the baron.
I saw you.
When you were a little girl.
But you, miss julie,
did not notice me.
Who gave you permission
to walk in our garden?
I remember one time...
No.
I'm not going to tell you.
Is it bad?
It isn't.
But kathleen might hear me.
From her room?
I think she's snoring.
She doesn't.
But she talks in her sleep.
How would you know?
Why don't you sit down?
It wouldn't be proper.
In front of miss julie.
And if I order you to do it?
I'll obey.
Get me something to drink.
I'm not sure what we
have in the icebox.
- I believe it's only beer.
- My taste is simple.
I want beer.
Miss julie.
Thank you.
Are you not going to drink?
I don't like beer,
But of course
if you order me...
I thought a polite gentleman
should keep his lady company.
A point well taken.
Toast me.
Are you bashful?
To your health, miss julie.
Bravo.
Now kiss my shoe,
To get it just right.
Excellent.
You should have been an actor.
This won't do.
Miss julie,
Somebody might see us.
What would that matter?
They would start talking.
Miss julie should have heard.
How their tongues were
wagging when we danced.
What were they saying?
Sit down.
Tell me.
Ah, you know.
You're not a child.
When one sees a lady
drinking alone with a man...
A servant in the night... then...
We're not alone.
We have kathleen.
Let's go and get her.
Leave her!
What?
You shouldn't bother
those who are resting.
She's been working all day,
standing over the stove,
Even cooking for your dog.
She's earned a rest.
How nice you are.
Shall we go
and pick some lilacs?
I can't do that.
Absolutely not.
I order you.
Go.
I'm sorry, miss julie.
She was sick with the broth
you asked me to give her.
And I hardly gave her any.
I mean, it could have
killed her.
I like to take her out
in the sunshine.
She loves to run around.
In circles in the grass.
And then she drops down
on the warm stone steps.
And spreads out with
the sun on her back.
I see.
You may keep her.
It's john's.
Take the rest.
I sent him out
to pick flowers for me...
Lilacs.
Miss julie,
I am tired.
And if you don't
need me anymore,
May I go to sleep?
Why wouldn't you go out
to the garden with me?
I don't understand
what you're scared of.
My father isn't even home.
And the other people...
They are hired
to work here like you.
Do you think they would believe.
That I'm in love with a valet?
Such things happen.
It may be.
What an imagination.
I could step down.
Don't step down, miss julie.
They will say you fell.
You are strange.
So are you. Life is strange,
People... everything.
We're just foam
floating on water.
Until we sink.
Sometimes I dream that
I'm on top of a column.
And I can't get down.
I'm almost fainting
when I look down,
But I must get down.
I'm so scared to fall.
I can no longer hold on
and I long to fall.
But I don't fall.
Yet there's no peace,
No rest till I come down.
I would be descending.
I would fall.
And if I reach the ground,
I want to go further down.
Deep into the earth itself.
Did you ever feel this?
No, no, I...
I dream that I am lying
under a tall tree.
In a dark forest and...
I want to go up,
Up to the top, and look around.
At the bright landscape
where the sun is shining.
And so I can rob the nest.
In which lies the golden eggs.
And I climb and climb.
But the trunk is so thick
and so slippery,
And it is so far
to the first branch.
But I know
that if I can only reach.
That first branch,
Then I would easily
reach the top.
I haven't reached it yet...
That first branch... but I will,
If it only be in my dreams.
Are you ever afraid to hear.
That you're no longer wanted?
That you don't belong?
I shared a bed.
With my little brother,
And one morning
when I was eight
I woke up and found him
dead beside me.
I saw death for the first
time and, yes, I was afraid,
But not in the way
you're talking about.
I mean,
My wee brother,
His open coffin...
Frost was creeping
into my backbone then.
It's always there. It's in me.
I will never go back
to what I was born into,
Where I used to belong.
Come, come, let us pick
nine midsummer flowers.
And put them under our
pillows, miss julie,
And all our dreams
will come true.
- Let me see what you've got in your eye.
- Oh, it's nothing.
It's just a bit of dirt.
It'll be gone in a minute.
Sit down.
Sit still.
My,
I think you're shaking.
Careful.
Sit still.
Yes.
Now it's gone.
Kiss my hand and say thank you.
Miss julie, listen to me. Kathleen is close by.
Will you listen to me?
- Kiss my hand first.
- Listen to me.
- Kiss my hand first.
- Blame yourself then.
- For what?
- For what?
Are you a child?
You're playing with fire.
- I'm not. I'm dreaming.
- No, you're not.
Shame.
I said shame on you, john.
- You meant that?
- Yes, I meant it.
I am tired of this game.
And I ask to be excused
in order to resume my work.
The baron will return in the morning,
and he'll want his boots polished.
Stop!
I forbid you.
Put away the boots.
It is my duty,
which I am bound to do.
He is a good master.
And I'm not expected
to serve as your playmate.
Then shine my shoes first.
Why, you're proud.
In some ways, not in others.
Pour us a drink,
A strong one,
a midsummer night one.
I will empty the glass
in one swallow.
Thank you, john.
How nice of you.
Have you ever been in love?
We don't use that word.
But I have liked
a lot of girls.
And once when I could not
have one girl I wanted,
I became sick, horribly sick,
Sick like a prince
in a fairy tale,
A prince who cannot
eat or drink.
Because of love.
Who was it?
It was you.
Do you know what the world
looks like from my place?
No, you don't.
Your lot are like hawks.
You're like falcons, always
floating about high in the sky.
And their backs
are rarely seen,
'cause they just glide along,
Right up there.
Come.
Come with me.
See?
It's as if you have
your own secret world.
Tell me about your home.
It must be a boundless
misfortune to be poor.
Oh, miss julie,
A dog can lie
on a countess's sofa.
A horse may have
its muzzle stroked.
By a young lady's hand.
But a servant boy...
Ah, well.
My home...
It is a shack.
Far out there
in the gray wasteland.
Where there isn't even
a single tree.
And you can't see it from here
even if you climb to the top.
It's hidden.
Sometimes, as a boy,
I was drawn to see your castle,
Your gardens.
And when I came close
enough, I could see.
The wall around your park.
In the evenings I would
creep to the wall.
And climb up to see your home...
Oh, far more magnificent
than the church.
I had never been
inside of it, never,
But no matter where my
thoughts went later in life,
They would return always
to that place...
Me sitting on the wall,
Shaded by trees.
And covered by honeysuckle,
Watching the people
coming and going,
Like they were kings
and emperors,
And I knew.
That world would never be mine.
And then.
One day
I caught sight of a pink dress.
And a pair of white stockings.
I saw you.
Walking among the roses.
Yes.
I fell in love.
Oh, I wanted to talk to you.
I... I wanted to...
Touch you.
And I thought, if it is true.
That a robber can enter the kingdom
of heaven and be with the angels,
Then why can't
a peasant like me.
Be in the baron's garden.
And just play
with his daughter?
The next Sunday, I washed
myself with soap and hot water.
And put on my best clothes.
And went to church, where
I could see you again.
I did see you.
Yes, miss julie, I did see you.
And went home
determined to die.
But I wanted to die beautifully.
And peacefully,
Without any pain.
And then I recalled
that it was deadly.
To sleep under an elder bush.
And I knew of a big one,
In full bloom.
I picked all of its flowers.
And made a bed in the big
box where we keep the oats.
I laid down.
And pulled the lid down
over myself,
Closed my eyes.
I fell asleep
on the poisonous elders.
And I woke up a very sick boy.
But I didn't die,
As you can see.
And I knew that I could
never have you.
You're everything
I can never have.
You speak like...
Like what I find in my books.
Did you ever go to school?
Not much, no,
but I have read a lot.
And gone to the theatre.
And have listened
to the conversation.
Of better-class people.
I even try to speak like them.
You stand around and listen
to what we're saying?
Oh, yes.
And I have heard a lot.
When I was driving the
carriage for you, miss julie,
Or rowing the boat for you...
you and your girlfriend.
What? Tell me.
It wouldn't be easy to repeat.
I was surprised.
I couldn't understand
where you, miss julie,
Had learned such words.
Perhaps there isn't quite as
much difference as they think.
Between human beings
and human beings.
May I ask permission
to go to bed?
Go to bed?
On midsummer's night?
You said...
Dancing with the mob out there.
Has no attraction for me.
Good night, miss julie.
Sleep well.
Get the boat.
And take me out on the lake.
I want to watch the sun.
Would that be wise?
Are you afraid
of your reputation?
I don't want
to be made ridiculous.
And I don't want to be discharged
with no recommendation.
Maybe I even owe
kathleen something.
Oh, you're afraid of kathleen?
- Take my advice and go to bed.
- Are you ordering me now?
Yes, for once,
and for your own sake.
The night is far gone.
You've been drinking. You
don't know what you're doing.
I hear the crowd coming
this way to look for me.
I can't be found here with you.
I love the people,
and they like me.
Let them come, and you'll see.
No, miss julie, they don't like you.
They...
They take your food and your
money and spit at your back.
Why? I never hurt them.
The mob is always cowardly.
They are false-hearted.
In such a situation there's
nothing to do but run away.
Let us run away. -Run away where?
To my room?
No, no, miss julie, to mine.
We'll be safe there. I'll look after you.
Trust me, I will.
- If they will look for you in there?
- I'll bolt the door.
And if they try
to break it down?
I'll shoot.
Come. Come.
Do you promise me that...?
Promise... -I promise.
Man: Kathleen! Open
the door, kathleen!
- Woman: Kathleen?
- Man: Will you open it?
I don't know who I am.
I don't know who you are.
I don't either.
You don't know who I am?
Did you say that?
No.
No what?
Come over here.
Your hand in mine.
I did not tell you,
That time I saw you
in the garden,
I sat for hours on the wall,
Just looking at the house
until the sun set.
And then I...
You may despise me now,
But I did what I never
had dared to do before.
I jumped down
on the other side,
Hoping you'd come out again
so that I could speak to you.
I don't know
what I was thinking.
I knew that I didn't belong.
I was very scared, miss julie.
I knew who I was...
A boy who found his brother starved
to death in the bed beside him,
And my father telling me.
To never upset his lordship,
How good the baron
had been to us.
I knew I had to get out
of your garden.
It was forbidden to me and
I would upset my father.
And then I saw someone coming.
It was the baron.
My heart was hammering.
I ran like mad afterwards,
Plunging through
the raspberry bushes,
Thorns tearing at me. You can't
imagine what it was like,
With the thistles
that stung my feet.
A week later I saw you again...
Walking among the roses.
In such deep thought.
And looking so lonely,
Even unhappy.
You did not see me.
Oh, I wish you had.
John: Please.
I beg you.
I am sorry. I am sorry.
You don't understand.
I am sorry.
Forgive me.
I cannot stay here any longer.
Please stay in the room
until I make sure.
Kathleen won't see you.
Kathleen, please.
Please, kathleen.
Please stay here.
Just for a little while.
Please stay in here.
There are things I...
I can't control now.
I can't control her...
miss julie.
Don't.
Don't talk, shh. Wait.
I will talk.
I'll come back. I will.
Stay in here now, kathleen,
For me, for us.
Try to sleep.
Please, you... you need sleep.
Kathleen may have heard us.
I think she knows.
What shall we do?
John, what are we to do?
We?
We.
We've been doing
what everyone is doing.
It is midsummer night,
miss julie.
Between midnight and dawn
lovers are allowed.
To open their hearts
and their loins.
Listen, we...
We could run away,
Travel far away from here.
Leave?
Far away. To switzerland,
The italian lakes, lake como.
I've been there.
I even told you earlier.
Life has given us an answer.
It's a miracle.
I even have a picture
over here.
Look.
That's the life...
Always new faces,
Never a moment to spare
for worry and nerves,
No need to wonder
what to do with yourself,
People dancing night and day,
Trains whistling,
And all the time
the jingle of gold coins.
That's the life, julie.
Oh, eternal summer,
Orange trees, laurels.
I'll start a hotel,
everything first-class.
- I'll have first-class customers.
- A hotel?
Yes! That'll be our life.
You will be
the pride of the place,
What with your looks
and your style,
Why, it's a sure thing.
I'm telling you,
You will never be lonely again.
I'll take care of you.
I promise.
Freedom, no more walls
and no gardens.
And you'll sit there
like a queen.
You'll keep the slaves going
by the touch of the bell.
And the guests will file
past your throne,
Timidly leaving
their offerings.
And you cannot imagine how
the people will tremble.
When they're
holding out a bill,
And you just sweeten them
with your pretty smile.
And one day
I will be as rich
as your father.
I may even buy him out.
Tell me you love me.
Otherwise I am nothing.
Not now, not here. And above
all, it's important...
No feelings. Then
everything will be lost.
Cold blood, clear heads,
grown-up people.
Let us sit at the table,
you there.
And I'll sit here. And we'll
just talk amongst ourselves.
As if nothing's happened
between us, making our plans.
Have you no feelings at all?
I? No one is more full
of feeling than I am.
A while ago you held me.
I... I was in your bed.
Yes, that was then. Now we have
other things to think about.
Don't speak harshly to me!
We have made one mistake,
A big one.
There's no sense
in making another.
Now the baron may be back
at any moment,
But before he comes,
I need to know...
Do you believe in me?
How can we do all this?
We have no money.
True enough.
I want you to be my partner.
I'll need your money.
I have no money, not of my own.
I have nothing myself.
That's it then.
You think I'm going to
stay in this house.
As your woman?
Do you think I'll let people.
Point their fingers at me,
laughing at me?
Do you think I can ever look my
father in the face after this?
- Oh, what have I done?
- Don't try that one.
Turn off that fountain!
Do you even know what love is?
Me?
I should say so!
Do you think this is
my first time?
Oh, now you despise me.
Don't pretend you're nervous.
And don't pretend
you're special.
We are the same now.
Look here, my little one.
Let me treat you to a glass.
Of something super fine.
Where did you get this?
In the cellar.
My father's wine.
Well, isn't it good enough
for his son-in-law?
Thief.
You going to tell on me?
Yes, to the fools.
I'm so unhappy.
Why? Think of kathleen.
I even had to forbid her
to come to the kitchen now.
- Don't you think she has feelings?
- A servant is a servant.
And a whore is a whore!
Oh my god, I'm so scared.
I'm in a dark hole
and it's like I'm sinking.
I'm sinking.
You are sick, young lady.
I do feel sorry for you.
When I was a little boy,
Lying there in secret, looking
at you in the garden.
And saw you walking
among the roses.
And saw your slim white ankles,
Well, I tell you now,
I had the same nasty thoughts
like all young boys.
You said you wanted
to die for me.
It was a lie.
I had to think of something.
It's the fancy talk that
makes women open their legs.
Bastard! -Make sure
you don't carry one.
- So now you've seen the hawk's back.
- Not exactly its back.
- Oh, how can a human soul be so filthy?
- Wash it off then.
You minion! Stand up
when I speak to you!
Stand up when I speak to you!
Minion?
Shut your mouth, lady whore!
Shut up and get out of here!
Telling me I am a minion!
You have no right to be in here!
You're not needed!
Kathleen doesn't like your kind.
Visiting her kitchen,
especially you.
Do you think she would be so
vulgar as you were this evening,
Throwing yourself on a man
the way you did? -No more.
Where do you think you are?
In a zoo? In a whorehouse?
No more.
Yes, I'm dirt. I'm nothing.
I don't belong. I know.
But please,
please help me, john.
I need to find
a way out of this.
Please help me.
Help me find a way out of this.
I may be partly to blame,
But do you think
someone in my position.
Would dare even to look
at someone like you.
If you hadn't asked for
it, begged for it?
Please.
I'm still amazed.
Though I must say the victory.
Was far too easy
to be really exciting.
Oh, no more.
I'm sorry I said that.
I don't want to strike
one who is unarmed.
Oh, I cannot deny.
That it has given me pleasure.
To discover that what has
dazzled us below you.
Was only gaudiness,
That there is powder
under tender cheek,
That there is grime
under your dirty nails,
That your perfumed
handkerchief is dirty, julie.
Oh, it hurts me to realize.
That what I yearned to reach
is so far from genuine.
It's nothing. It's worthless.
I'm sorry you've sunk
so low, julie,
Far lower than your own cook.
It hurts like.
Watching the last flowers
of autumn.
Hanging their heads,
already faded.
Or torn to shreds by the rain.
And turned into muck.
You talk as if you are
already above me.
I am bred by a baron.
You can never achieve that.
Aye, that's true.
But I can provide a baron,
with your help.
You're a thief. I'm not.
There are worse things than
being a thief, much worse.
Anyway, think about it:
I am serving in a household.
And I look upon myself
as one of the family,
As a child of the house.
And it isn't regarded as stealing
if a child picks a berry.
From a large bunch.
Shh, shh, miss julie.
Miss julie.
Shh.
Miss julie, you are
a wonderful woman,
And you're far too good
for one like me.
You've been drinking.
You lost your head.
And now you're trying
to cover up your mistake.
By telling yourself that you love me.
Well, you don't.
Unless my looks
may have tempted you.
And maybe there was
a physical attraction.
But that makes your love
no better than mine.
I could be your pet,
like your dog.
That you give affection when it suits
you, but that's not enough for me.
I can never make you love me.
Are you so sure?
Are you meaning to say
that it might be possible?
Oh.
And that I could
fall in love with you?
Oh.
Oh, aye.
Well...
Aye.
Yes, I could.
You are beautiful.
You are refined.
Oh, I love that in a woman.
You are educated.
We could read together,
all the great writers.
We could discuss them.
Oh, you...
The fire you ignite in a man
isn't likely to go out.
You are like hot spices
with one of your kisses.
Leave me alone.
You're disgusting,
Like a rat.
I hate you.
Run away with me then.
Yes, we'll run away.
Are you my friend?
I am at times.
But don't rely on me.
I need you to understand me,
To see me.
Don't give me the secrets
of your life.
You'll regret it.
You sound like my mother.
Oh, she was so beautiful.
Look at this picture of her.
She didn't want to be a mother.
She would smile at me
but didn't mean it.
Sometimes when I think of her,
My mouth smiles.
But I do not smile within me.
Don't drink more.
It's as if
I am cut off from
everything that's life.
Inside me,
Within me... nothing.
A black hole.
She taught me.
To mistrust and to hate.
All men.
And I promised her...
this little girl of 10...
That I would never,
Never be a slave.
To any man.
I didn't even understand
what it meant.
Then you hate me too.
Yes.
I'd like to shoot you
like a dog.
No qualms?
No qualms.
But you have nothing
to shoot me with.
And I'm no dog.
I'll take you up to my room...
And then I'll put you
in my birdcage.
Most of all, I'd like to die.
Die?
How silly.
On the shores of lake como,
You said,
the sun always shines.
Look at the wall out there.
It's all you can see
from down here.
You can only feel
the light of the sun.
And you can only hear the wind.
On the other side of that wall,
I have a place,
A secret garden.
There's no wind there.
I go there when I'm anxious.
I'm anxious all the time.
I'm always longing
for some other place.
You cannot imagine
how different
I wanted my life to be.
When I was little,
Just after mama died,
I was hoping that.
All of my garden.
Would be full of animals.
They'd come from...
I don't know where
they'd come from.
They'd be there.
To keep watch over me.
I have a pit in my stomach.
I do not know where
my sorrow comes from.
And now you.
You and me...
Yes, we must leave.
To make life hell
for each other?
No.
To be happy,
Smile on the inside.
Enjoy ourselves a few years,
As long as we can.
And then...
To die.
Would you die with me?
I won't die at all.
I enjoy life.
You refuse to die with me?
I'm sorry, miss julie.
I'll talk no more.
I'm going to bed.
You... you dishonored me.
You owe me something.
There.
Thank you.
This is what I get for
opening my heart to you,
For giving away
my family honor?
I told you not to.
You... you forced me.
You were the seducer.
We can get...
we can get married.
And then we can divorce.
I won't demean myself.
- Demean?
- Yes, demean.
Oh, how I wish it undone.
How I wish it...
- I told you.
- Oh, if only you loved me.
I told you
you should not drink,
Because then you talk.
You shouldn't talk.
A butterfly dies
in the act of love.
I wish I did too.
What do you want?
Am I to cry with you again?
What...?
Do you want me to kiss
your feet again?
What?
I've had enough, miss julie.
This is painful.
Miss julie, miss julie,
I see that you're unhappy.
Yes, you are suffering, but...
I don't understand
what you're saying.
I mean, my people...
We don't carry on like you do.
We don't hate
and destroy each other.
We make love for fun.
Yes, it is a game,
And we play it when we
get time off from work.
But we don't have
all day and all night.
Like you people do.
You know what?
I think you're ill.
Yes, I'm sure you're ill.
Be kind to me, john.
Talk to me like a human being.
Well, then be
a human being yourself.
You think you can spit on me,
But won't let me
wipe it off on you?
Help me then.
Tell me what I should do.
Lord, if only
I knew that myself.
I... I know.
I... I've been acting wild,
As... as if I'm mad. I know.
But now.
What do I do?
Stay here and keep quiet.
Nobody knows.
I... I can't stay here.
Everyone knows.
They don't know,
And they would never
believe it.
But suppose
there are consequences.
Consequences?
Then there's only
one thing to do...
You must disappear.
You must leave at once.
I can't go with you. Then they would know.
You must go alone.
Alone?
Where? I can't do that.
You must, and before
the baron gets back.
If you stay, you know
what will happen.
Later you will write
to your father,
Tell him how unhappy you are.
He loves you.
He will take care of it.
He'll never guess it was me.
I don't think he'd be
anxious to find out.
- I'll go if you come with me.
- Are you stark mad?
Miss julie is
running away with a...
A servant?
It would be in the papers.
And, miss julie, the baron
will never survive.
I'm so tired.
I'm so tremendously tired.
Order me.
I must be told.
I can no longer think.
I can't move.
Do you see now.
What helpless creatures
you people are?
Why are your kind
strutting about.
With your noses in the air,
Like you were
the lords of creation?
Well, I'll tell you what to do.
I'll order you.
Go to your father's library.
In his drawer there is money.
Get the money.
Come up with me.
Go.
Get up there.
Speak kindly to me.
Orders always sound unkind.
Now you know
what it feels like.
Go.
Am I allowed
to leave my room now?
You look a mess.
May god forgive you.
What have you been doing?
You are my woman.
But the night is long,
kathleen.
All the wine...
My head wasn't with me.
It was swimming.
I asked what you
have been doing.
I have such pain, kathleen.
Let us hold around each other.
No. No.
I have this ready for you.
For church.
Oh, you... you always
have my things.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You promised me you'd come
with me this morning.
Oh, yes.
I remember now.
And here you are
with my finery.
Yes.
Come on with it then.
What's the text today?
The beheading
of john the baptist.
Ah.
Oh, you're... you're choking me.
Oh god, I'm so tired.
So tired.
I'm exhausted.
So why did you stay up
all night then?
Hmm?
Have you seen your face?
Miss julie.
She would never leave me.
Stop it. And she...
She who doesn't know what's
decent, she doesn't.
She talked. She needed to talk.
You know the way I am.
I'm always placing
a veil over people,
Idealizing them.
So I never see
who they really are.
I did that with her...
miss julie...
And I was bound
to be disappointed.
We are all forced
to face ourselves.
As less than we'd hoped to be.
Isn't it funny anyhow,
When you come
to think of it, her?
What is funny?
Everything.
Look at me straight in the eye.
Yes.
Is it possible?
Is it possible?
Yes.
It is.
It's awful.
I could scratch your eyes out.
Yes, that's the way
I feel about it.
It's nasty.
It's simply disgusting.
You're angry with her then?
No, I'm angry with you!
It was a rotten thing
to do, really rotten.
Poor young woman.
I won't stay in a house where you can't
have respect for your employers.
Are you jealous of her?
No, not of her.
If it had been clara or sophie,
Then yes, I would have been.
No, I will not work in a house.
Where people can't
behave decently.
Would you?
You just dragged yourself
down in the dirt by doing it.
Get out of here!
Get out! Get out of here!
- Why should you respect them?
- You don't know?
You, who think you are such a smart fellow?
You don't know?
All it shows is that they are
not a bit better than we are.
If they are not any better than
us, then there is nothing.
To inspire us to become
better ourselves.
And did you ever think
of the baron?
Just think of all the sorrows
he's had in his time.
Listen, jesus, I won't
stay here any longer.
And have to face him.
And then with someone like you.
I can't imagine why she did
it with someone like you.
If it had at least been with
a man of her own people...
- If it had been with a better man.
- What are you saying?
She, who wanted
to give her dog poison.
Because it ran after
the gamekeeper's mongrel.
- What?
- Listen.
You're fine for what you are,
But there is a difference.
Class is class.
Well, let me tell you,
I won't stay here any longer.
On the 14th of October
we are leaving.
Yes, that's right.
You're coming too.
You can get a job as a janitor,
Or maybe a messenger
in some government office.
It may not pay you as well as the
baron, but it will be secure.
And then your widow and
children will get a pension.
I'm going to plan my death
so you will get a pension?
I'm sorry, I have better
prospects than that in mind.
Who's that walking around
up there?
Can it be the baron?
Already?
Listen.
If I leave,
I'll never get
another job like this.
And you... why should you go?
You've never seen
much of the world anyway.
I... I don't know
why you would go.
When the baron leaves
on the 14th of October,
Then we are leaving too.
It's been some years now,
you and me.
Don't you forget
your obligations.
Let's hope.
That the baron
will never find out.
What happened here,
in his servant's room,
This midsummer night.
Go and shave yourself.
You don't want him to come home
and see you looking like this.
I'll take the dog out.
And I'll come back.
And you and I will go to church.
And you will ask god
to forgive you.
And I will ask him to help us,
All of us.
My god.
What a sight you look.
Why? How do I look?
You're white as a corpse.
The sun's rising.
And the trolls are dancing.
Yes, they've been
dancing all night.
I've got the money.
How much?
I took all of it.
Please come with me.
I can't go alone,
Not today.
On midsummer day,
The trains will be packed.
I can't... I can't go alone.
In the midst.
Of the black and gray
on the train,
People looking at me
as if they know.
Oh, it's so beautiful
out there.
The garden.
I never showed you
my little brook, did I?
I know you'd love it,
all my flowers.
Miss julie,
I am going with you,
But it has to be
right now, right away.
What's that?
Oh.
What is it?
It's my canary. -Are you
taking a cage along with us?
I'm not leaving her behind.
Drop the cage.
It's the only thing I'm
taking with me from home.
Drop the cage, I'm telling you.
Kathleen will be here
at any minute.
All right, listen.
You... you will go
out the main entry.
I will use
the servants' entrance.
And we'll meet outside
the front gate.
L-l-let go of that bird.
Now. Kathleen will
take care of it.
No, my little bird.
He's not taking you.
No.
The bird. The bird.
Give it to me.
My little bird,
He's not taking you.
For god's sake.
Shut up. Shut up.
Kill me too.
Kill me.
Killing an innocent creature.
Without blinking an eye.
Oh, I hate and despise you.
There's blood between us.
I curse the moment I saw you.
I curse the day I was born.
Kill me too.
You think I can't stand.
The sight of blood.
You think I'm weak.
Oh, I should like
to see your blood,
Your brains lying there
on the table,
See your whole sex
swimming in blood.
Like my little bird.
You think I am weak!
You think I love
you because my womb.
Cried out for your sperm.
You think I want to carry
your brat under my heart,
Feed it with my blood
and give it your name!
You, what are you
called anyhow?
John, john and then?
What is your family name?
Maybe you don't have one.
I would be mrs. Lackey,
mrs. Shit-pile,
You dog there
wearing my collar,
You minion wearing my crest.
Share you with kathleen,
Share you with my own servant,
Parcel you out to all the other
needy women working here.
You think I'm a coward
and want to run away.
Oh, no! No, I'll stay,
And let the lightning strike.
My father is coming home.
He'll find his desk
broken into,
His money gone.
Then he'll ring that bell there.
Twice for his lackey.
And he'll send for the police.
And I'll tell them
everything... everything.
Oh, it will be good
to get an end to it.
And then my father.
Will have a stroke and die.
And that will be
the end of all of us.
And all will be quiet, peace,
Eternal rest.
The baron's line
will be wiped out.
And the lackey's line.
Will continue in an orphanage.
There spoke the royal blood.
Dragged up in the gutter,
and dead in the jail.
Bravo, miss julie.
Make sure the lackey
doesn't lose his place.
What is going on?
What a mess you've made.
You're a woman, kathleen.
You're my friend.
You must understand me.
You must listen to me.
I don't want to know anything
from you, miss julie.
What's going on?
Kathleen: What? What?
Kathleen, you have to
understand me.
I don't want to understand.
You must listen to me.
If you're planning
on getting john.
To go away with you,
miss julie,
I will have to stop you,
both of you.
Quiet, kathleen,
and listen to me.
I... I can't stay here.
And john... he can't stay here.
So we have to... to get away.
What?
Wait, I have an idea.
All three of us can.
Go... go together.
Abroad to start a hotel.
I have... I have money, see?
And john and I.
Will run the whole thing.
And... and you can...
I think, can run the kitchen.
Oh, wouldn't that be fine?
Oh, please say yes, kathleen.
Come along with us.
You have to get out
and see the world.
You can't imagine.
How fun it is
to travel by train.
We just talked about it.
You'll love it.
Trains whistling,
Carriages stopping,
Bells ringing.
Upstairs, downstairs.
You'll stand... no, you'll...
You'll sit in the kitchen
like a queen.
Of course.
You're not going to stand
at the stove yourself,
Naturally not,
With all the fine clothes.
You'll be wearing
to greet the guests.
You're so beautiful, kathleen.
Yes. I'm not flattering you.
You'll find a husband,
a rich englishman.
They're so easy to catch.
And we'll be rich.
We'll build a villa
on lake como.
It rains there.
A little,
A little, a little bit.
Sometimes.
But the sun will be
shining sometimes.
Though it looks dark.
And...
Then...
Or...
We can go home again,
Come back here.
Or...
Somewhere else.
Do you believe in this
yourself, miss julie?
Do I believe it myself?
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
So you were going to elope?
Elope?
That's a big word.
You heard the young lady.
And maybe she's tired now.
From being up all night,
But it's a plan
that could work.
Are you telling me
I'd be the kitchen girl
for her?
Her?
Will you please
speak more refined.
When you're talking
in front of your mistress?
Do you understand?
My god. Listen to you.
It would be better for you.
To listen a little more.
And talk a little less.
She is your mistress.
If you despise her
for what she has done,
You should despise yourself.
I have always respected myself.
And looked down on others.
And I have never done
anything that is beneath me.
You could never say
that the baron's cook.
Had lowered herself to be with the
stable groom or the swineherd.
Quite so. You had me.
And very lucky for you too.
Lucky?
A man who steals
from the baron?
You shouldn't be talking.
You, who can't even respect
your own mistress anymore.
John,
Are you coming with me
to church?
You could use a good sermon.
No.
I am not going to church today.
You go alone
and confess your sins.
Yes.
I'll do that.
And I'll bring back enough
forgiveness for you too.
Jesus suffered.
And died on the cross for us.
And if we go to him
with an open heart.
And all our sorrows,
He will take our sins
on himself.
You really believe that,
kathleen?
I've believed it
all my life, miss julie.
And that is why
I stand here now.
With the faith of my childhood.
Where sin overflows,
There grace overflows more.
Oh, if...
If only I had your faith.
It is not given to everyone,
Without god's special favor.
Not everyone deserves it.
To whom does he give it?
Only god knows that.
It is a work of grace,
miss julie.
And god is no respecter
of status,
Except the last shall be first.
So he helps the last then?
And it is easier.
For a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle.
Than for a rich man to enter.
The kingdom of heaven.
So you see, miss julie,
it's just the way it is.
Well...
I am going.
Alone.
And as I pass by the stableman,
I shall tell him not
to let out the horses.
If someone should like
to get away.
Before the baron comes home.
Goodbye.
What would you do in my place?
In your place?
Let me see.
Well, as a lady, as a woman,
After that kind of mistake,
As one who has fallen...
I don't know.
Yes.
I do know.
With this?
Yes.
But I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't.
Do you understand?
There is.
A difference between us.
It's the same difference as
between a man and a woman.
This about a rich person.
Not getting to heaven...
It's a lie, isn't it?
The baron is back.
Kathleen. What if kathleen...?
He's seen his desk.
Yes, it is john, your lordship.
Yes, your lordship.
Right away.
In half an hour, your lordship.
Yes, yes. In half an hour.
He called for his boots.
Wants his coffee
in half an hour.
Julie: Half an hour.
I'm exhausted.
I don't know what to do.
To run, to stay,
Live or die.
You know what I want to do,
But I don't know how to do it.
Make me.
Order me.
I'll obey you like a dog.
I can't.
I don't know why.
It's as if
just wearing this jacket,
I cannot order you.
I... I... I heard
the baron's voice.
Now,
I can't explain it, but...
Oh, god, it's that...
It's that damn servant boy
sitting on my back.
I... I... I do what I'm told.
I... if he... the baron
came down here now.
And told me to cut my throat,
I'd do it on the spot.
Then pretend that you are him.
And pretend that I am you.
Did you ever see a
magician at the theatre?
The magician says,
"you do everything I tell you,".
And she does what she is told.
He says,
"take the broom,".
And she takes it.
He says, "sweep,".
And she sweeps.
I see silver and gold...
And all the stars.
Just like when I went
to sleep as a child.
I'm floating out of the
window and up to the sky.
Such freedom,
Surrounded by
sparkling crystal.
And the dark.
Is no longer dark.
The whole room.
Is warm and safe
like an open fire.
It's you.
And I am close to the fire.
How nice and warm it is.
And it is so quiet.
And so light.
Here is the broom.
Go to the barn.
Use it.
Go now, while it's light.
Use the tunnel,
So you don't meet your father.
Thank you.
Tell me.
That the first can also receive.
The gift of grace.
Say it even if you don't
believe it.
The first?
No, I can't do that.
But wait.
Miss julie, I know.
You no longer belong
among the first.
Oh, you're among the last.
I am one of the last.
Oh.
And the first.
Shall be the last.
Don't speak.
Don't think.
Don't think.
Go, miss julie.
No other way.
Go.
Wait.
I'm sending you out
into the world.
Look.
You're like
bright-colored stars.
The water is your heaven.
Do you know that,
My flowers?
Yes.
Everything is so much bigger.
Than the little pieces.
Do you know that?
