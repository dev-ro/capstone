Just as long as Carol doesn't find out.

Where's Winnie going ?
Hey Winnie, where are you ?
Winnie, Where are you ?
Where are you going ?
What have you found ?
Hollowface woke up,
because someone called his name.
After many many years
he was free.
he wasn't young or old.
or ugly or handsome
He had no shape.
He didn't even have a face.
He remembered a boy with a
face that looked like him.
Hollowface had to find the boy
He had to find his face.
Until one night Hollowface finally found
a face to steal.
It was a little boy staring out of a window.
Hollowface wanted the boys face
more than anything else in the world.
Without a face.
He had nothing.
So he devised a plan.
First ...
... he'd separate the boy from his parents
then he'd take him back to his lair.
he'd rip of his face
and wear it himself
that way everybody would love him.
The next night Hollowface dressed up as a man
& went back to the boys house.
He ran up the wall quickly
he slipped through an open window
He found the boys room & slipped inside.
The boy was sleeping.
Hollowface moved closer
& closer
& closer
Continue Mia.
That's all I have.
- You haven`t finished it ?
- I didn't know how to.
Its not bad.
You've hooked your audience
& left us with a cliffhanger.
Try to finish it for next week.
Well we`re all looking forward to
finding out what happens next aren't we.
- See you later.
- What time was the party again ?
6, Don`t forget.
- Ok.
- bye.
- see ya.
- Hey
- You're late.
- Sorry.
- Who was she ?
You're sweating.
come on, lets do the cake.
Hey birthday girl.
Daddy
Happy birthday.
its a teddy bear.
We got you something else to.
Thanks
- This is so cool
- I wanted one of those for ages.
Its actually an antique,
he's almost 50 years.
An old teddy bear,cool.
I love it Dad.
Really.
So how old are you again ?
- 9 ? 10 ?
- Dad.
- 4 ?
OK guys, it's time.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear Mia
Happy birthday to you
Hollowface woke up
because someone called his name
after many many years
he was free.
When Hollowface came out of his lair
the people looked right through him
it was like he was invisible.
he saw people in the street
talking and kissing
and knew that without a face
no one could love him.
Hollowface kept hunting for a boy to steal his face
He looked everywhere, in
every window of every house
until one night
he found a house with a child inside
and an open window.
he crept through the rooms
and down the corridor
where he saw a girl
who was still awake
so he crept closer & closer
& he forgot all about hunting for the boy
now Hollowface wanted the girls face
more than anything else in the world
so he devised a plan, he would hide
in the dark corner of her room
and wait for her to go to sleep
and then ... he would
I really want one.
What ?
- Just one.
- No! No! No don't !
- You don't need it
- I do.
That's pathetic.

Dad.
I'm 12 years old.

You should try to sleep.

John! hold on
- Dad.
- Jesus.
You scared the life out of me.
Are you ok sweetheart ?
What's the matter ?
I had a nightmare.
What was it about ?
Come here.
Come on.
Go back to bed,
you have school tomorrow.
What if the nightmare comes back ?
Come on.
- Dad, where are we going?
- Come on its fine.
Shit.
- Dad !
- Why are you standing out there ?
- Come on.
- What are you doing ?
- Yes, got it !
Remember this ?
- The anti-nightmare book
- Dad, this is ridiculous.
Come on, come & sit down.
I haven`t read this in ages.
Come on.
Now, which one shall we read ?
- That one
- This one ?
- OK.
So ...
If a big red devil
with big teeth & claws,
comes to you & tries to squeeze
you in its jaws
just light it up & say ...
Dad.
Ohhh ? You to grown up ...
And you will see its just a shadow
& you can see it through.
You see, the monsters are cowards.
You stand up to them they run away.
Not this one.
- This ones different.
- They are all the same,all cowards.
And you know they would never dare come into this house
if they know i'm here.
But he's already inside.
What do you mean ?
Where ?
I don't know.
I think he spy's on me when I'm asleep.
I know he's there.
Right.
Now ...
To kill a monster ......
... You have to enter their story.
See, they think your gonna run away.
But if you enter their story ...
... They`re screwed.
So.
Now...
There's something missing.
Ahhh perfecto.
Wow there he is ...
There's our monster.
So ... you think your scary, huh?
Now listen mate.
Its the end of the road.
We've had enough.
You cannot keep bothering
my daughter at night.
OK.
Stand Back.
Whoa look at him go !!
Wow !
- Look, he's gone.
- Look at his face.
Looks so scary !
What the hell are you doing ?
Are you crazy ? What is this ?
- Mia go to your room.
- Its all right we were just playing.
What do you mean playing ?
You could of burnt the house down.
She had a nightmare
We were just...
- ... Getting rid of it.
- What do you mean getting rid of it ?
- What do you mean ?, What is this?
- Sue, it was a game.
Throw this thing away
before it stinks up the whole house.
Mia what's the matter ?
What is this ? What's wrong ?
Tell me.
He's here.
He's inside.
Oh come on sweetheart.
There's nobody here
its just you and me.
Look.
Daddy look.
Mia, get out.
Get out !
Dad !
Dad !
Dad !
Help me !
John !
John what's going on ?
Call the police !
Please.
Just let her go.
Don't hurt her.
Sweetheart Are you okay ?
Are you okay ?
- What's going on ?
- There was a fucking man in her room !
Are you ok?
You ok ?.
Awful business,
- I think he must of come in through the window.
I chased after him... but ...
... he'd gone.
Did you see his face?
Could you give us a description?
It was dark.
He had a hood on.
Give that to forensics George.
Once an intruder had been seen
he very rarely comes back.
We`ll get it, don't worry Mr.Farrow.
Thank you.
He said not to worry.
He said he definitely wont come back.
Its ok.
You sit down here lovely.
- Has she said anything ?
- What do you want her to say ?
She's terrified.
Are you ok ?
What is it sweetheart ?
Talk to me.
Mia
Talk to me !
Sweetheart,tell me what's wrong.
Mia
Sweetheart,what is it ?
And then he leapt from your window ?
Oh Mia i'm sorry,what a terrible thing to go through.
It must be terrifying.
And you haven`t been able to speak ever since.
Or you haven`t wanted to.
I can`t.
You know, it's all right to be afraid.
I get scared to sometimes,everyone does.
I'm afraid the things i imagine
will really happen.
Please come with me.
As there is nothing physically
preventing your daughter from speaking.
Her silence is an acute emotional response
to the severe shock she experienced.
So what do we do ?
We have to be patient.
- Should she keep going to school ?
- Oh yes absolutely.
You don't want to disrupt her routine,
but i will need to see Mia every day.
Every day ?
Mr. Farrow.
I`m sure you want to avoid Mia reliving the experience
through flashbacks
or recurring nightmares.
We want to facilitate a successful emotional processing of
the trauma
through basic counselling.
During the sessions
Mia will confront her fears
We found it to be extremely affective.
Hollowface did not give up
He would wait for the right moment
to rip off the girls face.
Hollowface crept closer
and closer
and closer.
- You haven't got one that's a bit quieter ?
- Quieter ?
You wouldn't have a Chihuahua as a guard dog would ya ?
This is a Rottweiler.
Its an excellent choice.
Complete security package
No more worries.
How about...
I made you something to eat.
You doing your homework ?
Listen Mia, you don't have to do it if you don't want to.
You want to ok.
Come, come here.
Sit.
You can only access the images
on the central website with a password.
Its very secure.
Yes hi Mike,
i need to enter a password
for a customer.
The name John Farrow.
Yes
1-9-6-7 ...
Hollowface crept closer
and closer.
The girl knew that Hollowface was there.
She could feel him watching her
She wanted to scream for help,
but when she opened her mouth she couldn't make a sound.
Her parents couldn't keep her safe
because Hollowface was already inside.
he'd made a new lair.
Right in her room
In a dark corner
everyone had forgotten about.
His new lair was big enough for both of them.
Hollowface would drag the girl into his lair
and keep her there in the dark.
Imprison her away from her parents
forever.
Then she wouldn't need her face ever again.
He started calling her to his lair.
She felt his claws reaching out to her.
John
Mia,are you okay ?
Are you okay ?
Were going run some more tests
anaphylactic shock is a severe
hypersensitivity body reaction
but i don't want you to worry Mrs.Farrow
we will find what triggered it.
In the mean time I'm gonna prescribe
some intravenous adrenaline & sedatives
if case of emergency.
If she loses consciousness and the ambulance
takes to long,you can inject it yourself.
It takes only a couple of seconds to take effect.
- I'll have a nurse show you how it works.
- OK, thank you.
I'll go get the nurse.
- Could you give us a description ?
- Em it looked really weird.
Its like...
like it was deformed.
Deformed ? Ah but its a good job
you installed those security cameras.
I'll have one of my men
check the coverage.
- I will need your password.
- Yeah, of course.
Sorry, would you excuse me.
- Hey how is she ?
- She's all right,she's all right.
It's Dave.
Please take this,
He's been calling the whole time.
Hello ?
Mrs.Farrow,can you tell me what happened tonight ?
I'm calling because your
mother asked me to.
- Your mother wants ...
- Yeah look.....
don't worry, everythings fine,
I'm taking care of the situation.
She's worried about Mia, how is she John ?
I didn't see him,i just ...
John.
Dave, I can talk right now
Sorry I've gotta go.
Dave ... how are they ?
They'll be fine.
What's goin on ?
Good morning John,come through.
Is everything OK ?
Sue, where's Mia?
Is she OK ?
She's here John she'll be fine.
Hello John.
What is this ?
Please John, take a seat.
Mia knows that she has the full love
& support of both her parents.
Especially you John.
You have a very special bond with her.
I should hope so I'm her father.
Susanna tells me that you haven't slept well
since the accident at work.
I think we've all had trouble sleeping ever since a man
started appearing in my daughters bedroom that night.
I understand.
John there's a very rare syndrome.
Which is often brought on by stress,
which occurs
when two peoples psyches
become entwined...
... It's a shared disorder.
Called Folie Adieu.
When two People with close emotional ties
share the same hallucination.
Hallucination ?
There's no intruder John.
It's in your imagination.
And in Mia's.
- What the fuck are you talking about ?
- John, I'd like you to look at this please.
Play that again.
What is this ?
There was no one there John,
Nobody else in the room but you & your daughter.
- Mr. Farrow.
- Who the fuck are you ?
This is David Wharton.
From social services.
We're all here to help you John.
The condition can be treated
very successfully through therapy.
But John,the first step will be to
separate you from Mia for a while.
If you have nowhere else to go
We can help you out with that.
I recommend that you speak to my colleague
Dr.Whinisky,he said he'll treat you.
This is ridiculous, it doesn't make any sense,
I was in the fuckin room.
He was there,
He was attacking my daughter.
Sue, you were there, tell them.
Sue !
- TELL THEM !!!
- Mr. Farrow, you need to calm down.
I didn't seen anything.
You saw the video,theirs nobody there
I don't fuckin believe you !
So you think I'm crazy do you ?
Don't worry.
By the time you get home I'll be out.
Mia.
When we get home,Daddy's not going to be there.
We have to separate you for a little while.
Why ?
Mum says you've been writing a story at school.
Who is Hollowface ?
Susanna it might be easier for Mia
if you left us alone for a minute.
Mia, is there something you want to tell us ?
I didn't write the story,
I pretended I did.
Did your father tell you the story?
You know Hollowface isn't real.
I know Hollowface doesn't exist.
but he thinks he does.
If he comes near the house again Mrs.Farrow,
Please let us know immediately.
Yes I will.
- We can get a court order.
- No,no,no,it wont be deemed necessary seriously.
- So er,this is the room.
- This is a nice room, Mia.
Do you mind if we talk outside ?
Mia,I'm gonna be back in a minute, yeah ?
So what do you recommend?
LEAVE ME ALONE!
Mia.
What if we got for
a nice yummy meal tonight?
Yeah, like a Chinese restaurant ?
What do you think ?
Good idea ?
Lets go.
LEAVE ME ALONE !!!
Louisa ,can i speak to you when you have a minute ?
Don't worry it must just be a nightmare.
I'm sure he'll calm down.
Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.
after many many years
he was free.
John.
He's back.
Who's back ?
Your going into anaphylactic freeze,I'm sorry.
Baby !
She can't breathe !
The shots not working
Call an ambulance !
It's me,I'm here.
Can you hear me ?
I know he's here &
i know your afraid.
but that's all over now,because i know who he is
& i know why he came back.
Come on! Keep talking !,
Keep talking !,Keep talking !
Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.
After many many years
he was free.
He wasn't young or old.
Ugly or handsome.
He had no shape.
He didn't even have a face.
They had locked him away in the dark
in a hole where the sun don't shine.
He remembered a boy with
a face that looks like him.
Hollowface had to find the boy.
He had to find his face.
When he finally found where the boy was hiding
Hollowface didn't know what to do.
Seeing the mother kiss the boy
made him feel envious.
He wanted to be like the boy.
He wanted to be loved
So he devised a plan
First he'd separate the boy from his mother.
Then he'd bring him to his lair.
& he would rip off his face
and wear it himself.
Hollowface got closer & closer
and closer.
You don't know the rest
of the story, but I do.
Hollowface couldn't find the boy.
And that made him furious.
Mia!
Mia, you have to fight back !
You have to ...!
Mia!
You have to fight back !
You have to fight back Mia !
Hollowface never stole the boys face.
Because Hollowface didn't realise something.
The boys mother would never let him take
her son away without putting up a fight.
Because parents ...
... Are always willing to do
anything to protect their children.
Its all right.
I'm here.
Your safe.
He's gone.
He won't ever come back again I promise.
It's over.
Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.
Hollowface wasn't old or young,
Ugly or handsome.
He had no shape.
He didn't even have a face.
He had nothing.
But now ...
... After many,many years.
He was free.
