Antwone. He's here.
Antwone's here.
That's Antwone.
Antwone?
First call. First call. 
- Damn. Berkley?
- What?
- You been in there 10 minutes.
- Shut up.
One day chief's gonna catch you
taking them Hollywood showers.
I should snitch on you.
Come on, move, man.
- Get out of my way, snitch.
- Come on, move. Yeah.
Got you, man.
Quit playing, man.
What's cracking, Fisher?
Your head if you don't
get away from me.
What is that on your face?
Say something else. Say something.
You're always talking.
Get off him.
- Why do you gotta fight? Relax.
- I'm cool, man. I'm cool.
Punk mother...
Petty Officer Fisher, you're accused
of violating article 128:
Assault on a superior
non-commissioned officer.
- How do you plead?
- Guilty, sir.
In your statement, you say your attack
on Petty Officer Berkley was provoked...
...by a racial slur. Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.
Petty Officer Berkley, did you make
any racial remarks to Officer Fisher?
No, sir.
- Stand at attention!
- Stand at attention.
This is the United States Navy, son.
I find you guilty.
There'll be a forfeiture of $200.
You're restricted to the ship for 45 days.
And you'll perform 45 days extra duty.
I'm reducing you from petty officer
third class to ship serviceman seaman.
And I'm recommending that you be
evaluated at the psychiatric clinic...
...before our next underway period.
You're dismissed.
- What happened?
- How'd it go?
Same old, same old.
I gotta go to the psych clinic.
- The nut house?
- Farmer, shut up.
Give it up to the shrink?
Damn.
See you next week.
Seaman Fisher.
Right this way.
I understand this is not your first time
here. You saw Dr. Williams?
No, he saw me.
- That's your wife?
- Yes.
Have a seat.
- I understand you like to fight.
- It's the only way some people learn.
But you pay the price
for teaching them.
- You wanna talk about it?
- About what?
Whatever's bothering you.
Why's something gotta be bothering me?
Why? Because I jumped on a white boy,
something must be wrong with me?
"Send him to the psychiatrist. Nigger
tried to kill his master. He must be crazy."
- You looking for a discharge?
- I ain't looking for nothing.
- That's where you're headed.
- If I want out of the Navy, I'll just leave.
- Unauthorized absence?
- If that's what the Navy calls it.
Running away how you handle problems?
I don't have no problems.
Where you from, Fisher?
- Where'd you spend your childhood?
- Cleveland.
Parents still live there?
- I never had any parents.
- They deceased?
I never h...
I never had parents.
That would make you a medical miracle,
Seaman Fisher. Where you from?
I'm from under a rock.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, I'm gonna see you next week.
- I ain't coming back.
- Why not?
- Because there's nothing wrong with me.
- I agree with you there.
See you next week.
See the receptionist on your way out.
Next Wednesday, 1400.
Walker. Philip Walker.
That was the name of the last guy
who stalked me.
- I'm busted.
- Yeah, you're busted.
- What's up? Where you been?
- I'm on restriction.
- Again?
- Yeah.
- How did you get off the ship?
- I just came from the medic.
Why?
Well, I'm working on this high priority
paper for this commander.
- What kind of paper?
- I'm not at liberty to talk about it now.
Well, I was gonna invite you
to a party.
Me?
Yeah, you.
- I'm on restriction.
- Yeah, you told me.
I gotta... You know...
I'm gonna get back to the ship.
They're probably looking for me
right about now, so...
I'll talk to you.
Damn.
See you when you're off restriction.
Yes.
Yeah, send him in.
Get your monkey hands off me, man.
I thought you may have forgotten your
way, so I sent an escort team for you.
You may be able to make me come here,
but you can't make me talk.
Thank you. You're dismissed.
You don't wanna talk to me?
Let me lay this out for you.
This is how many cases I have, okay?
I don't have time to waste.
I get three sessions only...
...to make an eval and a recommendation
to your commanding officer.
You know he wants to throw you
out of the Navy.
You can sit here and not talk.
But our sessions don't begin...
...until you begin talking to me.
- I got nothing to say.
Okay.
Then we'll sit until you do.
We can sit here until the day I retire.
- Doesn't matter to me.
- Me either.
- All right.
- What about the brig?
- What about it?
- Send me to the brig.
There's the brig right there.
Lock yourself up.
What do you know, time's up.
See you next week. 1400.
Want some chips?
- What?
- I didn't say anything.
- I thought you said something.
- I was just clearing my throat.
Okay.
Maybe you're coming down
with something.
I'm all right.
- It's just...
- Just what?
It's just a waste of time sitting here,
week after week. Wasting time.
I don't want you
to waste your time, Antwone.
So, what you want me to say?
It's not what I want you to say...
...it's what you wanna tell me.
Maybe you can start by asking me
a question. Get things going.
I can do that. You said you come
from under a rock. What did you mean?
I don't know.
It's the first thing that come to my mind.
- What do you think it means?
- Well, it could mean...
...that you feel under pressure...
...that you feel a weight pressing down
on you. That you're in the dark, alone.
- You said you had no parents.
- I had parents.
Okay.
- Only three sessions, right?
- Only three.
My father's name was Edward.
- So you knew him?
- No.
- I didn't even know his last name.
- Do you know where he is?
- Yeah, I know where he is.
- You ain't... 
He went to his ex-girlfriend's house. 
They got into an argument.
She killed my father.
- Where was your mother at the time?
- Behind bars.
I see.
I was born in prison two months
after my father was murdered.
- Why was she confined?
- I don't know.
- All I know is what I told you.
- So you were turned over to the state?
Yep. The state placed me
in this orphanage.
It was supposed to be until
my mother got out to claim me.
She got out but she never claimed me.
- How long were you there?
- Two years.
How's that make you feel, Antwone?
- I don't know.
- You must have some feelings about it.
What did it feel like?
- Rainy days.
- Like rainy days? Okay.
Why is that?
You know, in Cleveland...
...it rains, not all the time...
...but to a kid who wants
to go out and play...
...it seems like it rains every day.
But...
Kids expect it to rain sometimes...
...but for one kid, it rained too much.
Okay.
- You want me to come back next week?
- Yes, I do.
- You ever try to find her, your mother?
- No, sir.
Okay. Next week.
Busy day?
No more than usual.
- These tomatoes are from our garden.
- Yeah?
They're so much better than last year.
I'm no green thumb or anything,
but who knows? Maybe I'm learning.
These tomatoes really are good.
When I was 2, I was placed
in the Tate foster home. 
Reverend Tate, he was
a fire-breathing preacher. 
He had his own storefront church. 
There was only a few members. 
There was Mrs. Tate, Cousin Nadine... 
... my foster brothers: 
Keith. Keith was half-white. 
Dwight. And me. 
There was church three times on Sunday, 
Bible study on Tuesday... 
... YPWW meetings on Thursday, 
choir rehearsal on Friday. 
We learned if we caught the Holy Ghost, 
Mrs. Tate would give us vanilla wafers. 
So we'd catch it every Sunday. 
Good God! Come on, church!
Celebrate!
Reverend Tate, he didn't like Dwight
at all.
He said he had too much pride.
So he tried to beat it out of him.
Sometimes he would even try
to beat him to death.
- Did he beat you?
- No, sir.
I think he pitied me.
I liked him for it.
But I was ashamed of him.
What about Mrs. Tate?
What about her?
I don't know which one of you
no-good, rotten, hard-headed niggers...
...put your dirty hands on my walls.
But I bet I'll get the right one.
I took you in when your
no-account mammies threw you away.
And this is the thanks I get?
You ungrateful niggers.
Now I know I got the right one.
She used to brag about... 
...beating me unconscious.
She threatened to do it again.
But she never did.
Why do you think she never did?
Maybe she was scared.
She found a new way
to get me, though.
- So you like fire, huh?
- No, Mu-deah. I don't like fire.
You stay away from things
that don't belong to you.
You hear me?
- You hear me?
- Yes, Mu-deah.
- You hear me?
- Yes.
Dumb nigger.
I tried everything I could
to get her to like me.
Nothing ever worked.
Were you the youngest
of the foster children?
Dwight was the youngest.
I was in the middle,
and Keith was the oldest.
Mrs. Tate used to put us against
each other so much...
...we started hating each other.
But I think deep down inside,
we really hated ourselves.
- What do you mean?
- Keith was half-white.
She would try to compare Keith
to me and Dwight.
He had the good hair,
we had the bad hair.
She used to say Keith was better than us
because his father was white.
I wished I was Keith.
Not even Keith could escape
from being called a nigger.
She hardly used our names,
she said "nigger" so often.
Called us nigger so often, we could tell
who she meant by the way she said it.
- What happened to Dwight and Keith?
- Dwight's in Lucasville State Penitentiary.
Keith got taken back by his mother.
He was raped by one of her boyfriends.
- Did that ever happen to you?
- Hell, no.
Okay.
Was Mrs. Tate ever?
Was she ever nice to you?
Yeah, there were times.
Sometimes she would tell her friends...
...that we were good kids.
That she was proud of us.
- Chummy times.
- Chummy times?
I could tell what kind of day it was gonna
be by the scent in the air when I awoke.
- How could you tell?
- If I awoke to the smell...
...of grits and eggs or water steaming
off pavement as she hosed it down...
...I had to look out all day.
But if I smelled pancakes,
everything was okay.
She make pancakes very often?
No, sir.
I can delay my next appointment
if you wanna talk some more.
No, sir.
Hey, Slim?
What?
- You going home next leave?
- Yeah, gotta tend to the flock.
When I get leave, I'm gonna be like
a vampire coming to town with his coffin.
- A place to lay down before I get down.
- What's that mean?
- Shut up. People are trying to sleep.
- Shut your grouchy ass up. Jesus!
When you going home, Pork Chop?
When your mama quits tripping
and sends me my money.
What about you, Fish?
When are you going home?
Fish? Fish?
Last night I had a dream about Jesse. 
- Who was Jesse? 
- He was my best friend. 
When I wasn't at home, I was wherever
Jesse was for three reasons: 
One was, being his friend, 
he wouldn't beat me up. 
Jesse, look. I got five.
The other reasons were
so he wouldn't beat me up. 
- I only got three.
- I liked him a lot. 
Give me yours.
We used to drive
our friend Kenny crazy. 
Let's get Kenny.
Kenny hung around me for
the same reasons I hung around Jesse. 
- Kenny, let me see.
- Where's Jesse?
Stop! Stop!
Get them out! Get them out!
- Kenny, what's wrong?
- Kenny, don't forget to write.
Mrs. Tate, she hated Jesse. 
She hated seeing us together even more. 
But she couldn't keep us apart. 
I was so happy when she kicked me out. 
Twonny?
That hoodlum nigger Jesse called
here asking for you.
Said y'all are going
to the picture show.
Now that's the devil's work.
Who told you you could go
to the picture show anyhow?
Where'd you get the money, nigger?
Did you steal it?
- I told you, I've been raking lawns.
- Well, you would've stole it.
Give me the money.
I said, give me your money.
You don't know what to do
with no money.
That's why I never let you have none.
Why you always gotta make things
difficult for me?
Difficult. Difficult?
- Where'd you learn such fancy words at?
- Ain't no fancy word.
- Don't sassy me.
- Ain't no one sassing.
- Don't sassy me!
- Ain't no one sassing you.
You ain't gonna beat me no more.
No more!
Lord Jesus.
I want you out of my house.
And who do you think
will take you in, huh?
Retarded nigger.
Don't nobody want you.
Your damn mammy
didn't even want you.
Give me my shoe. 
Must have felt pretty good
when you took that shoe from her.
It felt like I was gonna go
right upside her head.
- I just chilled.
- Why'd you chill?
I don't know.
Well, I'm glad you did.
How'd you feel?
I felt like I won a prize.
- But it scared me.
- Why?
It was the first time
I ever felt more powerful than her.
It was like a surprise.
- What ever happened to Jesse?
- We lost touch. You know how it is.
This may be helpful to understand
the mentality of people like the Tates.
Here. It's called The Slave Community. 
- Why understand somebody beating me?
- What you went through was, in part...
...the result of the treatment slaves
received from their masters...
...and passed on to their children,
generation to generation.
Right on down to the Tates.
Sir, that sounds like an excuse.
- I was a kid.
- I understand.
- Sounds like you're taking up for them.
- What they did was wrong.
They made the wrong choices.
This is not about them, it's about you.
You were sent to me
because you have an anger problem.
Well, you've got the right to be angry.
But you have to learn to channel
that anger, to use it constructively.
Instead of getting into fights,
go to the gym, hit the bag, lift weights.
You have to use that energy
to better yourself.
You're taking Japanese classes, right?
Okay, you're already on the right track.
Can we talk about this next week?
Three sessions, son. That's all
I'm given to make a recommendation.
I'm gonna recommend
that you be given a second chance.
That is what you want, isn't it?
To stay in the Navy?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Okay. Stay out of trouble.
- How you doing?
- I'm cool.
- You don't seem cool.
- I'm all right.
- You still working on that paper?
- No, I'm finished.
- I went through there for a shortcut.
- Where you going?
Nowhere.
I gotta go.
Cheryl, I'll talk to you later.
Why you always talking
about somebody's mama?
We ain't talking about somebody's
mama. We're talking about your mama.
Hey, Fish. I bet you won't be fighting
no more honkies on this boat.
- This ain't no boat, this a ship.
- This a ship.
Country-ass Negro.
Who let you in the Navy?
Fish, what's that book you're reading?
Let me see the cover.
The Slave Community?
- What you reading that shit for?
- Because I want to.
This ain't no slave ship.
And these ain't no slavery days.
I can't tell.
You're the only Uncle Tom on the ship.
You're a part-time brother.
Grayson, why you always talking shit?
- What I do got nothing to do with you.
- Better get out of my face.
Either you trying to hang out
with the brothers or the white boys.
- Make up your mind.
- Sit your ass down.
- What you gonna do?
- Come on, Fish. Stop!
- Let him go!
- You're weak, Fish.
Thank you, sir.
Who's next?
So, Dr. Davenport, sent him
to the gym? Hit the punching bags?
Ain't that what you're prescribing?
So why you here?
You feeling under pressure?
You feel like a rock is on top of you?
Come on, speak the hell up.
Better make it snappy,
you only got three sessions coming.
What are y'all looking at?
What you looking at? You feeling sick?
Do you need a healing?
Do you need a healing?
Do you need a healing?
Do you need a healing?
Some of you sick sailors need
to come back after working hours.
That's when the good Dr. Davenport
will lay his hands on you.
Or he may have a book
with the answers to all your questions.
Ain't that right?!
Ain't that right?
Would you like to step into my office?
- Are you finished?
- I thought I was just getting started.
It may have slipped your mind...
...but you're addressing
a superior officer. You understand me?
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir. I slipped up.
You better believe you did.
No, sir. I mean I slipped up
when I talked to you.
- What?
- Three sessions, right?
- That's correct.
- Can't flout regulations.
- That's correct.
- Well, what do I do, commander?
Because I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
Tired?
How was your day?
Long. Not complaining, though.
Well, don't wait up.
I've got a lot of work to do.
I know.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- It's nice to be off restriction.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be squared away for a...
- Want something from the Exchange?
- What's up with the Exchange?
You spend more time there
than on restriction.
- Just trying to be a good shipmate.
- I'm kidding.
- Bring me some Skittles.
- And a Snickers.
- Pork skins.
- And a sandwich. Thanks.
All right.
What are you doing here, sir?
I was in the area and saw your ship...
You just saw this big old ship
moored alongside the pier?
I wanna see you back in my office
next Wednesday, after knockoff.
That is, if you wanna continue.
I think I need to check
my calendar first.
- Sir.
- Okay.
- You let me know, okay?
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Cheryl.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
- You just getting off work?
- Yeah.
You mad?
Why would I be mad?
I'm sorry.
That's cool.
- So you finally off restriction?
- Yeah.
- So you can hang out now?
- Yeah.
So, what about now? I'm off.
No, I promised I'd meet somebody
in a few minutes, so...
- What's her name?
- No, it ain't like that.
What about tomorrow?
What about the day after tomorrow?
It's a Wednesday. After knockoff?
- That'd be better.
- Okay.
Meet me in the lobby
of the female barracks at 1700.
- Okay. I'll meet you at 1700.
- All right.
It's a date.
- Are we done?
- Yes, we are.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
You think it's possible for somebody
who's had problems all their life...
...not to stay that way?
- Think it's possible they can change?
- Absolutely. Why?
- No reason.
- Want something to drink?
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.
You know when you
kind of meet somebody...
...if you had problems, it wouldn't...
- Who is she?
- What's her name? What's her name?
- Cheryl.
- She works at the Exchange.
- That's a good thing. Keep it Navy.
Right? So?
So...
Have you spoken to her yet?
Yeah, I've spoken to her...
...but I get caught up, tongue-tied.
- Everybody's awkward at first.
- Not like me.
- Everybody is, trust me.
- Even you?
- Even me. Everybody.
So?
- We're going out tonight.
- Good.
We were supposed to go out
a couple days ago...
...but I just wanted to clear my head,
take some time...
...talk to you first.
- Okay.
- So, what should I do?
- Well, she's a nice girl?
- Yeah.
- Obviously you like her?
Okay. I think you should just
go out with her.
Sometimes it helps to take the anxiety
out of a future meeting to role-play.
- What's that?
- You play yourself. I'll play Cheryl.
I'll ask some questions.
We'll have a conversation. Okay?
- You'll play Cheryl?
- Okay, now. That's right.
I'm man enough to play Cheryl.
Okay... You go first.
- No.
- I'll go first. So...
- How you doing?
- Fine.
Good. Good.
So where are we gonna go?
Out.
See.
- I'm hungry. You?
- I could eat.
See, that's good. You got it.
- You think so?
- You've got nothing to worry about.
I'm gonna give you my phone number.
If you have any questions...
...you can call me,
anytime of day or night.
- Have fun. Give me a call, okay?
- We're gonna be fine.
Okay. You never know, son. These
things, sometimes they can escalate.
Escalate into what?
My wife and I went out.
It escalated to marriage.
We're not escalating to marriage.
All right, good. You get out of here.
Have fun. Hey, have fun, okay?
- I will.
- Okay. See you later.
- No escalating.
- No escalating.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- What is this?
- Frappuccino.
- Frappuccino?
- Yeah. You like it?
- Six dollars?
- What do you care how much it costs?
All the money we're making.
That's why I joined the Navy, you know?
See the world. Build a fortune.
I don't know what to do
with all the money I got.
Okay, now tell me why
you really joined the Navy.
- For real?
- Yeah, for real.
All right. Well...
My father's a Navy man,
Vietnam vet...
...and his boys were gonna grow up
and join and serve just like he did.
Only one little problem.
He didn't have any boys.
- So you?
- So I... Yep.
It's worth it, you know?
Even if I hated the Navy,
which I don't...
...it's worth it just to see his eyes shine
when I put on that uniform.
- So you and him are close?
- Yeah, we're close.
Can't wait to go home for Thanksgiving.
You going home?
I'm gonna go home.
- I'm kind of hungry. How about you?
- I could eat.
What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- What?
- You sure?
- You should've ordered some.
- I just wanted one.
These are good. Vegetables are good
for you. Wanna try some?
Go on, try it.
It's good. It's got white cabbage,
purple cabbage, yellow cabbage.
Nasty cabbage.
Damn.
It's not that bad.
So...
...what do you like to do?
Or what do you wanna do?
- What would you like to do?
- What I'd like to do?
- I wanna teach.
- Yeah?
- My mother was a teacher.
- For real?
I think teaching is a powerful position,
you know?
- You get to give to kids and all that.
- I think you'll make an excellent teacher.
Really? Thank you.
I think...
I think you're beautiful.
Thank you.
- What?
- It's just funny...
I mean nice, what happens
to your mouth when you smile.
One side curls up higher
than the other. Did you know that?
- No.
- It's cute.
- Thank you.
- You shouldn't hide it, you know?
You should smile more often.
It's good for you.
Here we are.
- You had a good time?
- Yeah, I had a great time. Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- What is that?
- Japanese.
That meant,
"It gave me a great pleasure...
...to spend this evening with you."
- Cool. That was beautiful.
- Thank you.
So how do they say, "Maybe we can
do this again some time"?
I don't know.
- Well, let me know.
- I will. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hell, yeah. I kissed her, man. Shoot.
But I ain't getting
into intimate details with you.
For real. That's just how it is.
That's my girl. I respect her.
And?
Mind yours, mind yours.
God, that made me look like a pizza.
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.
- What you doing?
- Organizing.
- Organizing?
- These pile up.
You could start off
by getting rid of that one.
- You're gonna have to get in line.
- Yeah?
I remember that one.
Get rid of that one too.
Look at...
- A lifetime ago.
- Not to me.
Let me see this.
What?
How long are we gonna do this?
Are you gonna keep ignoring me?
Come on, baby.
What are you talking about? I mean...
We just having a good time.
Why?
You're gonna act like you don't know
what I'm talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- You do know what I mean.
- I'm hungry. I walk in...
Talk to me. Jerome?
- She kissed me.
- What?
She kissed me. I didn't even push her.
I walked her home, threw some
Japanese on her, and she kissed me.
- Listen, Seaman Fisher...
- I'm sorry for knocking on your door...
...but I had to. I had to talk to you.
- Hello. Sorry for busting in on you.
- This is highly irregular.
I don't know what to do.
We're underway to Mexico next week...
...and I'm getting serious with her.
- She'll be here when you get back.
- How do you know?
- If she has a fraction of your bounce...
...she'll be here. I guarantee.
- I should just chill?
- That's a good suggestion.
- Okay. I won't do this again.
- Thank you very much. Good night.
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.
- Who was that?
- A patient of mine.
He was on his first date.
He was so excited,
he couldn't wait to tell me about it.
Well, don't cure him.
Show me what you're working with.
Show me what you're working with!
I don't know about you, but if my math
is right, we're a lady short at this table.
You didn't know?
Fish just got himself a girlfriend.
- She's in the Navy, right?
- He writes to her every minute he can.
Just so romantic.
- I don't understand.
- You understand.
- I don't...
- She wants to mate.
Do the dance. Understand?
- Come. Come.
- No, I'm fine.
Let her oil the old slave down. What your
girlfriend don't know won't hurt you.
- Come on, get up.
- I don't want to.
You don't what?
- Leave him alone, Grayson.
- He didn't answer my question.
- What question?
- You don't what?
I've never seen you with a girl.
Man says he's got a girlfriend, right?
Well, anybody ever met her?
Anybody? Don't worry about it,
sweetheart.
You see, he's a cherry boy.
Never been to the sugar shack.
- Too scared to go.
- Fuck you, Grayson.
- Huh? What'd you say?
- You heard me.
Fuck me?
With all these women in here...
...you want me?
See what I mean, brothers?
Hell, I'm worried about you, Fish.
I mean...
...all this action up in here...
...why you don't want no woman?
Yeah. Faggot.
Here we go again.
Get off him!
Davenport.
What time does his plane get in?
Okay. No, I understand.
I understand.
Okay, just let me talk to him first.
All right. Thank you.
I thought we were
all done fighting, Antwone?
Let me in.
Your X O wired the statements
of your shipmates.
Now, do you wanna start
at the beginning?
You're gonna have to talk to me, son.
You better tell me something
because I'm all you got right now.
I'm trying to work things out,
but you gotta give me something.
- I don't know what to say.
- Tell me what happened.
- They were fronting me.
- What do you mean?
Some of the guys were bagging on me.
- I couldn't take it.
- How so?
It's just...
Just making jokes.
What kind of jokes?
Jokes about me with women.
I wasn't taking it.
What kind of jokes about you being
with women, Antwone?
Jokes like me being a virgin.
- Are you?
- I don't know. I might be.
Okay.
Why do you think
you haven't been with a woman?
Think about it, son.
There must be a reason.
You're a good-looking young man.
Must have had many opportunities.
- Maybe you don't like women.
- I like women.
- Maybe you don't care about sex.
- I care about sex.
- I think about it all the time.
- We're back where we started.
Then how come you've never been
with a woman?
- I have.
- Okay.
When?
- When?
- When I was young.
- It was a kiss.
- Okay.
- How was it?
- I hated it.
- It was terrible.
- Why?
- I threw up.
- Why?
- Why?
- Because...
Because she put her tongue in my mouth.
She always did.
- That's my mama.
- You said the other lady was yours.
- I changed.
- Boy, you can't change.
- That's my mama.
- Nigger?
- Nigger, you hear me calling?
- That's you.
- I said, nigger.
- Coming, Mu-deah.
- Dwight? Keith?
- Yes, Mu-deah. Here I come.
Get your behinds down here.
I told you all
not to mess up your clothes.
Nadine, we're gonna be downtown
at the Social Service office.
- All right.
- Twonny, you stay with Nadine.
Yes, Mu-deah.
Twonny, what you looking at
out there?
What you looking at?
That's it.
Give me some sugar.
Now get on downstairs.
What did I say?
Get on downstairs.
Get in that basement and drop them.
Hurry up.
Yeah, unbutton them all.
Come on.
I said, come on.
Pull them down.
You heard me, pull them down.
Pull them over my feet.
Now come over here close.
Closer. You don't have to be afraid.
Now touch me.
You know you want to.
Yeah, that's it. Kiss me.
Come on, I said, kiss me.
Baby, give me some sugar.
- Antwone!
- I'm gonna tell on you.
What's up, man? You all right?
Come on in.
You all right?
She did it again?
She hit you too?
It's okay, Antwone.
You can stay here.
I'll look after you. Come on,
let's get you a shirt.
She made me...
She made me do these things.
I was only a little boy.
If there was something I wouldn't do,
she would beat me.
And Jesse was the only one
you ever told?
Yes, sir.
She's the only woman
I've ever seen naked.
I'm almost 25 years old.
I've never done it.
That's embarrassing.
I hate it.
- Yes, can I help you with something?
- Hi, Mrs. Davenport. I'm Seaman Fisher.
- Antwone Fisher.
- What can I do for you?
I'm here to see the commander.
I'm one of his patients.
- He told me to meet him here.
- Well, he's not home yet. But...
Well, come on inside. You can wait.
- Would you like some cider?
- Sure. Thank you.
Seems you're getting ready
for Thanksgiving, ma'am.
Don't call me "ma'am,"
you'll make me feel old.
Call me Berta.
Are you going home for the holidays?
No, but the chief cook on the ship
is planning a big meal. I'll be there.
- That sounds nice. Here you go.
- Thank you very much.
First thing I saw the first time I was
in his office, it was you.
It was your picture. I thought
you had a nice face, a good face.
And that maybe he's all right
if he married a woman like you.
You ready to get started?
Yes, sir.
- Nice meeting you.
- It was very nice to meet you too.
I was just trying to be nice.
Why don't you try being nice
on that ship?
Have a seat.
- I like your house.
- Thank you. Tell me about your house.
- Your house the day you left your family.
- Sir?
The Tates, when they threw you out.
Tell me about that.
It was back to the orphanage.
They told me I needed
to develop my social skills.
Nobody was into adopting
teenage boys.
They sent me to a reform school
in Pennsylvania.
That's where I got
my excellent skills I have now.
- What then?
- I was on my own.
A social worker took me
to a men's shelter.
She gave me $67...
...and she said goodbye.
- How long were you at the shelter?
- Just till the next morning.
- Then?
I slept on a few park benches
and I came here.
- To my house?
- No, sir. I joined the Navy.
That's it.
That's the Antwone Fisher story.
Okay. That is it.
You're done for the day.
Don't talk to my wife anymore either.
You hear me?
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- Seaman Fisher.
- Sir?
Get up here.
- What'd I do?
- Cut the jaw-jacking. Up here right now.
I don't know what you think
you're up to, but you better be careful.
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't do anything?
- You didn't do anything?
- I didn't do anything.
My wife is inviting you to Thanksgiving.
She thinks you're very charming.
Do you have any idea where she
might have gotten that impression?
- Huh? Look at me.
- No, sir.
- Maybe she responds to nice people.
- Okay, nice people. Thanksgiving...
...my house, my family, my dinner table.
1400. Don't be late.
- Yes, sir.
- Get out of here.
It's nice out here.
How'd you find this place?
It's a lighthouse, I'm a sailor.
- It found me.
- You knucklehead.
- You come out here a lot?
- Sometimes I come out here to think...
...or to work out some problems.
I know what you mean.
Can I be honest with you?
Yeah.
Remember when I told you
that I was...
...I was working on that important paper?
Yeah.
Well, I lied.
- I know.
- You know?
Yeah. You're seeing
a psychiatrist, aren't you?
- You knew?
- It wasn't that hard to figure out.
- You trying to tell me I'm crazy?
- No.
So?
So I understand if you don't want
to be bothered no more.
You're not the only person
that's seen a shrink.
- Are you seeing one?
- No.
I told you, my dad's
a Vietnam vet. He has.
I guess he made it, huh?
So why are you seeing
a psychiatrist?
My life before the Navy
was kind of complicated.
- I was feeling ashamed.
- Of what?
Of being unwanted.
And, uh...
I didn't have no parents.
You know, I was afraid
to even approach you.
Would you believe that
I was too shy to approach you?
- No.
- Yeah.
- Until I realized you were stalking me.
- I wasn't stalking you.
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help, I'm here.
- You're doing it already.
- What am I doing?
Just being you.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy holidays, sir.
Happy holidays, ma'am.
I know...
...it's Berta.
Yeah, come on in.
Hello. I'm Antwone.
I, uh... Yeah, I'm hungry.
I could eat.
- 1400, huh? What took you so long?
- I stopped by to get some cider, sir.
- Okay, good.
- Happy holidays.
Thank you. Come on in.
We're about to say grace.
All right, everybody. This is Antwone.
Antwone, this is my family.
That's my mother, Johnny Mae.
- That's my wife's brother, Uncle Duke.
- How you doing?
- That's my dad, Howard. My sister Gwen.
- How are you?
- And her full-grown daughter.
- Hi, Antwone.
- You wanna come and sit next to her?
- Gwen, Gwen...
Come on, baby.
You can come on over here and sit.
All right.
- Duke, why don't you lead us in prayer.
- Okay. Everybody join hands.
Let's bow our heads.
Heavenly Father, we come to you
on bent knee and body bowed...
...as humble as we know how.
We are grateful for this opportunity
to share Thanksgiving as a family.
We thank thee for our health,
Lord...
...and for our friends,
who honor us with their presence.
We also pray for peace in the world
and in our lives.
- Amen.
- Amen.
All right. Let's do it. Yeah.
- There you go, Daddy.
- Thank you.
- Honey, you want more turkey?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
Don't you act all bashful around me.
- Especially at the dinner table.
- Dad, leave that boy alone.
- I'm okay.
- All right then, dig in. The food is free.
Howard.
You know, when I was in the service,
back in the war...
...that was before you were born.
- Howard.
Anyway, I spent the holidays
in Europe on guard duty.
I sure did miss my mama's
holiday cooking.
- Howard, would you leave the boy alone?
- I ain't bothering him.
- Leave me alone.
- Maybe he wants to eat.
- I'm just talking to the boy.
- Give your daddy some greens.
Listen, let me ask you something.
Where you from?
- Cleveland.
- Cleveland. Yeah?
I bet you miss your mama's
holiday cooking, don't you?
Excuse me.
- Where he going?
- I don't know.
- That's what always happens.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Why'd you do that to the boy?
- He ran the boy out of here.
I didn't run the boy out.
I was trying to talk to him.
- That's why I don't bring my friends.
- You okay?
Yes. I'm okay. Just never had
a real Thanksgiving at the Tates' before.
You didn't have a real one
here either, I guess.
- No, you have a real nice family.
- Thank you.
I got this for you,
for having me over today.
- A gift for me? Is it money?
- No.
It's a poem.
I can't see without my glasses.
- Why don't you read it for me?
- I'd rather you read it. Please.
Who will cry for the little boy
Lost and all alone
Who will cry for the little boy
Abandoned without his own
Who will cry for the little boy
He cried himself to sleep
Who will cry for the little boy
Who he never had for keeps
Who will cry for the little boy
Who walked the burning sand
Who will cry for the little boy
The boy inside the man
Who will cry for the little boy
Who knew well hurt and pain
Who will cry for the little boy
Who died and died again
Who will cry for the little boy
A good boy he tried to be
Who will cry for the little boy
Who cries inside of me
- Who will cry for the little boy, Antwone?
- I will.
I always do.
- It's beautiful, Antwone.
- I know. I told you I was good.
Yes, you are. You are good
because you're honest.
More honest than most people,
even in your anger.
The only thing you're not honest about
is your need to find your own family.
- Your natural family.
- I don't feel like I need to look for them.
- It'd answer a lot of questions for you.
- I don't have any questions.
You're upset with them because
they didn't come to your rescue.
- Maybe they didn't know.
- How could they not know?
That's the question you need
to ask them.
"Regard without ill will
despite an offense."
That's Webster's definition
of forgiveness.
- Why do I have to forgive?
- To free yourself.
So that you can get on with your life.
Why do I gotta go look for my family?
I got you, doc.
I think that he had a good time tonight.
Antwone. I think that he had
a good time, don't you?
Yeah, it seemed like it.
He did the sweetest thing at the door
when he was saying goodbye.
He invited me to come to his ceremony.
- He's graduating from his Japanese class.
- Yeah, I know.
- He wants me to come. To be with you.
- What did you tell him?
I told him that I would be honored,
Jerome.
Okay.
Okay.
Congratulations.
- Petty Officer Fisher. Good job.
- Thank you, commander.
I was waiting. Cheryl, right?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.
- Heard good things about you.
- Where's your wife?
- She couldn't make it.
Sends along her congratulations.
A small gift for you.
Okay. The Philosophy
and Opinions of Marcus Garvey. 
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.
Is there somewhere
we can talk in private?
- Do you mind?
- That's fine. I don't mind.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, sir.
Hello?
What's up, doc?
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Yes, you are, Antwone.
You're good.
I've heard nothing
but good things from your CO.
You're getting along very well
with your shipmates. I'm proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
Have you thought any more
about finding your family?
I don't know. For what?
I just think that there's nothing
more important than that, Antwone.
What are you trying to say, sir?
That I'm proud of you.
That I think you've come a long way.
Okay. You said that.
What's wrong?
There's nothing wrong.
You understand,
this is very difficult for me.
Our sessions have ended.
Now listen. Just listen to me.
- What do you mean they've ended?
- It's time for you to move on.
- We're working out my problems.
- We can't work them out anymore.
- Listen to me...
- Get off me!
Get out. Get out!
- Everybody's always leaving me.
- People grow. People move on.
You've grown. It's time for you
to move on.
My mother left me, my father.
Jesse. And you.
- Jesse? What do you mean?
- We should've never gone, that's what.
There's cow bells ringing in my...
Fucking head.
- Cow bells? Tell me about the cow bells.
- Nothing! Can't trust...
What happened to Jesse, Antwone?
Stay away from me. Nobody's taking
anything else away from me no more.
Who is it?
I just asked who it was at the...
Fish! What's up, dog?
- What's up with you, man?
- Chill. Stop playing.
What do you mean, stop playing?
Don't make me kick your ass, man.
- What's up with you?
- What's up with you?
Where you been at?
Where you staying? What's up?
I'm at the men's shelter.
Up on Prospect.
- Where you staying at? For real.
- I'm on the street.
- What you doing on the street?
- I got nowhere to go.
You ain't got nowhere to go?
You couldn't come to my house?
No. Your mom ain't gonna let me
stay up in here.
You're tripping. She ain't gotta know.
She work all day, sleep all night.
Besides, there's so many people here,
she wouldn't know you were here.
You can stay here. For real.
- You got something in the refrigerator?
- Yeah, we got something...
- You hungry?
- I'm hungry.
- You hungry?
- Yeah, man. Stop playing.
Smell like you've been
on the streets too, man.
Slow down, man.
Ain't nobody gonna take your food.
Remember when Mrs. Tate
wouldn't let you use her lotion?
She made you oil up
in old cooking grease.
You smelled like a fried chicken dinner.
You like:
"I sure is hungry!"
That was so funny. Had me rolling.
Not as funny as your mother
chasing you with that brick.
- You remember that? That was funny.
- I remember.
Dude, that wasn't funny.
I still got a knot on the back of my head.
- You know you're my best friend, right?
- What you want?
I can't be happy my dude
back on the block?
I can't be happy you're back home, man?
- I want you to do something for me.
- What?
- Look out for me.
- Is somebody after you?
Why somebody gotta be after me?
I just want you to look out for me.
- All right.
- You're my best friend, right?
- Yeah. Stop tripping, man.
- Let's get you cleaned up, hit the streets.
You know, Brenda I used to like?
Brenda you used to like
has got about three kids now.
She's all swole.
She's big. For real, dog.
- Ain't little-booty Brenda anymore.
- How's your mama?
Man, she got knocked up.
Go ahead and get something.
I got you.
- Break it off, old man!
- What you doing?!
This ain't no riddle! Ain't nothing
to figure out. Hold up, Fish.
You better break off my loot.
Look out for me, Fish.
By the end of the next day,
I was in boot camp.
I always felt like Jesse
was the lucky one.
- I envied him for it.
- How could he be lucky? He's dead.
Well, he left me and he knew
he was the only one I had.
So you're angry at him
because you felt he abandoned you?
Yes. A little bit.
- How is he the lucky one?
- He don't have to fight no more.
Neither do you.
- So you think I'll make it?
- I think you already have.
What do you think?
I think maybe in another life or time...
...I would have been king.
When you locate your family,
I want you to contact me.
All right? I wanna hear all about it.
Yes, sir.
I love you, son.
I love you too.
- Who's this?
- Guess who.
No, this is Philip Walker,
the late-night stalker.
What's up?
I'm going on leave.
- When?
- As soon as you put your request in...
...and come with me.
- You serious?
- Yes.
I just came back. They're not gonna
let me leave again this year.
Can you ask for emergency leave?
Tell them somebody close to you
is in desperate need.
Cheryl, I really want you
to come with me.
Even got these two open tickets.
To Cleveland?
- You're gonna try and find them?
- Yeah. I need to find them.
But not without your help.
All right. Let me see what I can do.
First the light-skinned girls, 
they got adopted the quickest. 
Then the light-skinned boys, 
then the dark-skinned girls... 
... and then, last but not least, 
the dark-skinned boys. 
I'm sorry. All birth records since 1980
have been moved to Social Services.
Last contact with your mother?
I was 2 months old.
- And with father?
- Never.
Place of birth?
Ohio State Correctional Facility
for Women.
I'll be right back.
I need you to sign for me.
- Best of luck, Mr. Fisher.
- Thank you.
There's nothing in here.
Why don't you go see
your foster mother?
Who, Mrs. Tate? I'm not...
I'm not going back.
Why not? She might know
something about your family.
I've never done this before.
Take a ride with me.
If you're selling shit,
just keep on walking.
My God! Is that you, Antwone?
Come here, baby.
Don't touch me.
Yeah, it's me. And I'm all grown up.
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Tate.
- You wanna come in?
- No.
Would you like to get her?
- Antwone's here.
- Lord, have mercy.
Where's the child?
Nigger, hug me...
Nigger...
Don't you know how to come home?
Where you been?
I came for one thing:
Whatever you can tell me
about my real family.
- I don't know nothing about your people.
- A name, a number, anything?
I said, I don't know.
Now come along. Come on.
I remember everything.
Everything.
You could have helped me,
but instead you beat me. And you?
- I don't know what you talking about?
- Yes, you do! I was 6!
- Now you listen...
- No, you listen to me.
- I think you've forgotten...
- I said, listen to me.
This is my time.
You understand me?
It don't matter...
...what you tried to do.
You couldn't destroy me.
I'm still standing. I'm still strong.
And I always will be.
Elkins.
Your father's name
was Edward Elkins.
Take Shaker Heights and East Cleveland.
I'm gonna take Akron and Cleveland.
Yeah. 1976.
Hello, I'm looking for the family
of Edward Elkins.
Edward Elkins.
- I'm looking for family of Edward Elkins.
- Ma'am? No, Edward.
- E-D-W-A-R-D.
- Yes, Edward.
- What? I'm speaking clearly, you can't?
- Okay. Thank you.
I'm looking for the family
of an Edward Elkins.
You should have said that
in the first place. Why you?
Yeah. We're from California.
Yes, it's very nice there.
Okay. Thank you for your help, ma'am.
Thank you. Bye.
Any luck?
- What you got?
- Chinese.
- Hello?
- Hello, ma 'am? 
I'm looking for the family
of an Edward Elkins. 
Edward?
Who's this calling about Edward?
My name is Antwone Fisher.
I'm trying to locate my family.
- Honey, Edward's been dead a long time.
- Yes, ma 'am, I know. 
A long time. He was my father.
Wait, wait. Who is this
calling me up out of nowhere?
- How'd you get this number?
- Out of the phone book. 
I've been calling Elkins all day.
I have no reason to lie to you, ma'am.
Edward never mentioned no...
What's your name again?
- Antwone. 
- Antwone.
I don't think he knew my mother
was pregnant. She was away in prison.
- You know how he died?
- Yes, ma 'am. 
He was murdered
by one of his girlfriends.
Oh, my God. Wait.
What made you decide to show up
20 years later in the middle of the night?
It's a long story.
But I'm in the Navy...
...and I'm stationed on the West Coast.
I gotta get back soon.
- Come by my house before you go.
- Okay. 
Okay, look, you have a pencil?
Take down my address.
It's 1089 Drexel.
1089 Drexel.
- You know where that is? 
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come by my house tomorrow, hear?
- Okay. Ma 'am? 
- You mind if I bring my girlfriend?
- I look forward to meeting her. 
- I'm sure she is too.
- Listen, you know...
...if Edward was your father,
then you're talking to your auntie, son.
You are talking to your auntie Annette,
your daddy's baby sister.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow. 
- Good night.
- Bye.
I found them.
- I found my family.
- You did?
Oh, baby.
- I don't know. What do you think?
- He does look like Eddie.
- I do?
- Yeah, you look just like him.
I brought my birth certificate.
Born '76. That's the year Edward died.
Yeah. He died in June,
and I was born in August.
- And your mother's name is Eva?
- Eva Mae Fisher.
I know Eva. That's Jess' sister.
- Who?
- Jess.
- You mean Fish?
- Yeah, Fish. Jess Fisher.
The boy's name is Antwone Fisher.
That's Jess' sister, Eva Mae.
- Mae-Mae. She lives on Hodges Street.
- I don't remember no Mae-Mae.
You know where she lives?
You don't know her, do you?
No, I...
No, no.
Do you wanna meet her?
Yeah. Yeah.
Are you sure? Because we can
take care of this right here and now.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Let me get my hat.
You want me to go with you?
No, why don't you just stay here
with us, baby?
Okay, let's ride.
Bye.
You aren't gonna let nothing
happen to me, are you?
No, Antwone. I'm not gonna let
nothing happen to you.
- Who is it?
- It's James Elkins, Edward's brother.
Did you hear me, Eva? It's James.
- What you want?
- Can we come in?
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey.
It's all right, son. Come on.
Who's that, Eva?
- That's Johnny.
- No...
...that's Antwone Quenton Fisher.
Who's Antwone Quenton Fisher, Eva?
That's my first-born son.
There's nothing going on around here.
- You wanna stay?
- I wanna stay.
I'll be in the car.
- You want something to eat?
- No.
Why'd you never come for me?
Didn't you wonder where I was?
Or what I was doing?
Or what I've become?
Even if I was still alive?
Didn't you?
I've taken care of myself.
I have.
I've never been in trouble
with the law.
I've read hundreds of books...
...written poems, painted pictures.
I've traveled the world.
I serve my country.
I speak two languages.
And I'm working on a third.
I never fathered any children.
I've never done drugs
or even smoked a cigarette.
I used to dream about you.
My mother.
My mother, you know,
what you'd be like.
How you'd look.
Your voice and your smile.
Even your scent.
For all these years,
I wondered about you.
I dreamed about you.
Didn't you miss me?
On the way to school each day...
...I imagined you were
just around the next corner.
And when I'd get there,
you'd be there.
And in my mind...
...you was always there.
You just couldn't find me.
So I'd race to the next corner...
...and you'd be there.
I knew you would.
Then you would...
...buy me ice cream.
And then you would take me home.
I'm a good person.
I'm a good man.
- How you doing? I'm your uncle Horace.
- Out of the way, Horace. Come on, baby.
- Here he is.
- Look at you. I'm your aunt Eda, baby.
Me, me! I'm your cousin Jeanette.
Welcome home.
And I'm your aunt Anna.
How you doing, baby?
- This is my wife, T.
- How you doing, good-looking?
I'm your cousin Eddie.
I'm named after your father.
- This is my brother Ray.
- What's up, dog?
I'm your cousin Jason, man.
Much love, much love.
All right, boys. Open up.
Welcome.
- All right.
- Come on, let's eat!
Hey, you want some pancakes?
There we go.
How about some sausages?
I'm not a virgin anymore.
I'm glad to hear that.
- How you doing, son?
- I'm great, sir.
Good. Good. Very good to see you.
So?
I took your advice. I found my family.
And I found my mother.
Good. So?
In my heart, I forgive her.
But if I never saw her again...
I understand.
It's funny to feel that way
about your mother.
But I did it and I owe it to you
to tell you that you were right.
- You owe it to me?
- Yes, sir. I needed to find her.
If I was right,
it was for all the wrong reasons.
- This stays between you and me, okay?
- Yes, sir.
My wife and I were gonna have kids
and found out we couldn't have any.
It rocked her to the core.
I knew what to do for her, though.
She needed help. Treatment.
I made sure she had it. The best
psychiatrist, the one who trained me.
But I, the well one, the strong one...
...at the same time, I went about
the business of shutting down.
Very subtle, very quiet.
It was my little secret.
Until one day a young man
came into my office and my life...
...and he blew up that little secret.
Right in my face.
And he put me to shame
in a way I never thought possible.
Because of you, Antwone,
I'm a better doctor...
...and I'm learning
to be a better husband.
You don't owe me anything.
I owe you.
You're the champ, son. You've beaten
everybody who was beating you.
I salute you.
- You hungry, sailor?
- I could eat, sir.
Well, let's go.
