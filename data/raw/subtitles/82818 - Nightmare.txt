- [Weather Forecaster] Sunday and Monday,
could be a pretty good size rain.
(children shouting)
- Shut up, and good night!
- [Weather Forecaster] 80
degrees down around Lakeland,
79 in Ocala.
- Not again.
- [Tammy] Kathy, please come up here.
We need you, please!
(children shouting)
- [Children] Hurry, hurry!
- [Kim] Kathy! Hurry, please!
- [Kathy] Shut up!
- Kathy, I saw somebody
looking in the window at us.
- Me, too.
- There's nobody there. Nobody.
Would you please, please go
to sleep? For me, at least.
Good night.
- [Weather Forecaster] Sea
level, three to five feet.
That's on the Atlantic. Four
to six feet on the Gulf.
What's going to happen
during the next 12 hours is
we're gonna have a wind shift change,
more to the southeasterly direction.
Right now, it's going northerly.
By tomorrow, it'll be southeasterly.
(soft, suspenseful music)
(forecaster chattering)
Beautiful day to get
outside. Gentle breeze.
It was a comfortable day.
I think that would be
the best way to put it.
85, that five-degree difference
makes all the difference in the world
as far as comfort goes.
There was no rain in the past 24 hours,
even though a cold front
pushed over the top last night.
High 85, overnight 67.

There, there. It was just
someone playing a trick.

- There are still some psychotic episodes
triggered by the dreams.
Tatum has been Dr. Williamson's
patient for a year now.
We think the dreams are fixated
on some childhood trauma, but
Tatum can't or won't tell us.
The experimental drugs are working 
for us.
We can control the violent episodes,
but we haven't succeeded
in stopping the dreams.
What we're trying to
do now is modify them.
Okay, Curt, let's hear them.
- Two or three times now.
Always at the same moment.
It's very strange.
- What else?
- It's like I...
It's...
It's like I'm a child.
I'm just a child.
- Now, think, George.
Are you looking at a child?
Or are you the child?
- Sometimes I'm the child.
And other times, it's
like he's standing there.
And then, again,
and then I think
I must be the child.
But it, it, it can't be me.
Not with...
- With a weapon, George?
- It's not a weapon!
It's a hatchet. Something
like a hatchet. An icepick.
Then they come in and
they give me the pills.
And it all disappears, vanishes.
- Okay, all right. It's
been a good session, George.
I think we learned a lot.
But I will wanna talk to you
about this again, George.
- Green, type this up first thing
when you come in the morning.
See that it's distributed and
put in Tatum's file, okay?
Case history synopsis.
Tatum transferred from
Braston State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane.
Remanded there by Fifth District Court
after arrest as suspect
in sexual mutilation
and murder of Brooklyn family.
Medical profile, intermittent
epileptic seizures.
Psychological profile,
paranoid schizophrenia
with delusions of grandeur
and obsessive-compulsive dream ideation;
the dream ideation apparently triggered
violent psychotic attacks.
Suffering from severe amnesia.
George's initial response to
methacyclodine was promising.
Later switched to our
newest hypnotic drugs,
hylamine and TL-54.
(gentle harmonica music)
Has shown rapid progress since.
Psychotic behavior has been extinguished.
Schizophrenia drug controlled.
Seizures drug controlled.
Obsessive-compulsive
ideation is drug controlled,
and the dream fixations and the acting out
have been modified by 
behavior techniques.
Prognosis.
Tatum is our first major success.
We have taken a dangerous psychotic
and completely rebuilt him.
Programming him for future government
or private sector use
will be our next step.
My congratulations to
one and all involved.
Thanks, guys.

- The halfway house
doesn't know where he is.
The outpatient desk hasn't seen him.
And you're his doctor,
and you don't know where
the fuck he is, huh?
That makes it kinda
unanimous, doesn't it, hmm?
So no one knows where he is, right?
- Look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry.
- Sorry?!
You lose a dangerously psychotic patient
from a secret experimental drug program,
and all you can say is
"I'm sorry"?
Did you check his job?
- Yeah, he left there two weeks ago.
You know, I think we're making altogether
too big a thing outta this.
The man is simply not dangerous.
- You're a bigger schmuck
than I thought you were.
- Shit.
- I want him back.
Now, if you value your job,
you will get him back
in this hospital before
things get out of hand.
Now, am I making myself
perfectly clear to you?
Do you get it?

Hurry home, hurry home!

I know I'm not home. I'll be
home in five minutes.
What's going on in there?

floor covered in blood!
- He what?
Well, don't touch him.
Oh, my God.
- [Kim] C.J.! (screams)
- I'll be right there. I'll be right home.
I'll be right home, just wait. (cries)
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
- It's C.J. He's bloody.
- Get the keys. I'll drive you over.
- Oh, God.
- Tell me, what happened?

(Susan crying)

not gonna be any help
to C.J. if you're a nervous wreck.
Easy, easy.
- Leave me alone!
- Tell me what happened!
(C.J. breathing hard)
(Susan crying)
- Hey, listen, we don't
know what's wrong with him.
(Susan crying)
Hey, listen, there's no sense in getting
all upset till we get there.
He's probably all right.
(C.J. breathing hard)
- [Tammy] Tell me what
happened! Let me see!
- It hurts! Leave me alone, I said!
- Hey, we're gonna be
there in just a minute.
(tires squealing)
- Mom, he's dying! He's dying!
(door banging)
- Oh, shit.
- (groans) Oh, it hurts.
- Out of the way, quick.
Okay, okay, how you doing?
Just relax, we're here right now.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Just lift your head up,
just a little bit. Okay.
Now, just tell me, what happened?
Just tell us what happened.
What happened, C.J.? 
How did you get like this?
- A man, out by the street.
He tried to kill me with a knife.
- What?
- It hurts. Oh, Mommy, it hurts.
- Hey, it's okay, buddy.
- You're gonna be okay.
- Oh, baby.
- Okay, your mommy's here.
We're here now. We're
gonna take care of you.
It's gonna be all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
It's gonna be all right. Okay.
Now, I'm just gonna lift up your shirt.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
C.J., it's ketchup.
- I knew it. I knew it.
I could see it in his eyes.
I've had it. I've had
it with these tricks.
You just love to scare
all of us, don't you?
We could have had an accident
out there driving so fast,
but you don't care about that, do you?
You don't care about your own mother!
Get upstairs to bed!
I mean it, get upstairs, I
don't want to even see you!
Get upstairs!
Don't come down till
tomorrow morning either!
(door creaking)
You two.
Ooh.
- Hey, that's your boy.
He's a little too bright and
a little too imaginative.
He's not some gangster.
- And as for you two...
Tammy, you're the oldest now,
you should know better.
Just get in that...
I don't even wanna see you!
Get in that television room.
Turn on the television.
Look at this mess.
Look at this mess.
How many times do I have to tell you
to stay outta the food, huh?
- Hey, relax, just mellow out!
- What do you know?
You don't have to face this every day.
I hate this fucking house.
Do you know I've hated this house
ever since the day he left,
the day after C.J. was born?
Who cares anyway?
- I care.
(soft music)
You want a drink?
(soft music)
- Scotch is in the bar.
- I got it.
- I'm sorry.
(soft music)
Gotta do something about him.
- What are you gonna do?
Tell you what.
Why don't we all go out to
McDuff's and get some dinner?
(Susan laughing)
You wanna go out to
McDuff's and get some fish?

It's not funny.
What do you wanna do, remain
in the fourth grade forever?
You need math to get by.

- Enough's enough.
Come on, both of you, up to

Come on.

- I can't babysit anymore.
I can't take anymore, I just can't.
- Wait a minute, now.
Just wait a minute.
- C.J. is not normal. He is evil.
- No, he just likes to
play games. You know that.
- No, he likes scaring.
He scares me, he scares
you, he scares everybody.
I just can't take it anymore.
- Come on, calm down, Kath.
- No!
The dummy, the phone calls.
He was in his room, it wasn't him.
Breathing, I just can't.
- Some crazy nut comes out
of the movies and calls you.
It's just a coincidence.
- No, it isn't.
- No, I can't let you. I need you, Kathy.
- You just gotta find another
babysitter, Ms. Temper.
I can't take it.
- No, I've just made some
lemonade. Let's go in here.
- No.
- Kathy.
(birds chirping)
- Sounds like a nice location.
How old's the house?
- Must be over 50 years old,
but it's in good shape.
- How many bedrooms?
- Four bedrooms, two...
Two baths, one upstairs, one downstairs.
It's got a beautiful view of the river.
- Sounds nice. I'd like to see the house.
When can I come over?
And I'll need some pictures.
Just like those on the wall there.
Just simple pictures. Polaroids'll do.
- Okay, I have a friend that...
I'll get you the pictures,
and you can come over
this week, if you like.
- Fine, I believe it'll sell.
I believe it'll sell quickly.
- Oh, good.
- I want you to put your mind at ease.
- Okay.
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thank you. You've been a lot of help.
- I'll call you in a few days, all right?
- A few days? Okay, thank
you, nice to meet you.
- Bye, now. Have a good day.
- Thank you. You, too.
- Say, "Cheese."
Asking me to take a Polaroid’s sorta like
asking Picasso to paint your car.
- That's fine. He said simple pictures.
(traffic passing)
(soft, mysterious music)
- Hey, come here.
There's nobody in the house, is there?
Take a look at that.
(soft, mysterious music)
- A man. A man's figure.
What's going on?
(dramatic crescendo)
- Nobody there now.
(dramatic crescendo)
Let's go take a look.
(mysterious music)
- Who's in there?
- Come on upstairs.
(soft, mysterious music)
Well, there sure isn't
anything up here now.
- That's so strange.
- I think our imaginations are just
getting affected by C.J.'s.
(faint heartbeat thumping)
- I can't believe what I saw.
- Hey, it was probably nothing.
Probably a very simple explanation.
- There's a lotta strange
things happening in this house.
- This is instant film.
- Let me see.
- Probably just a shadow in the emulsion.
- Let me see it.
- Did you ever see that
Antonioni film "Blow Up,"
where he thinks he sees a
murder in the photograph
that he keeps blowing up bigger 
and bigger
and bigger, trying to see the murderer?
- Yes, yes, there was
nothing in the picture.
Give me. Let me see.
- Yeah, there was, there was a murder.
(mysterious music)
Hey.
(heartbeat continues)
(intense, dramatic music)
Tell you what.
Let's pick the kids up at
school and go to the beach.
(keys clicking)
- All right, George, where are you?
(computer whirring)
(keys clicking)
(computer whirring)
Found. Myrtle Beach?
What the hell's he
doing in South Carolina?
(computer whirring)
He's sure as hell not in lockdown.
Let's see if he stole another car.

Oh, shit.

Oh, boy.

Look at 'em, look at 'em!
They're all over the damn place.
(gulls calling)
(intense, dramatic music)
- Mom! Mom!
Mom!
That man's down the beach...
That man that's been following me!
(C.J. breathing hard)
- C.J., do you know the story of
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?
- I'm not lying!
- That's enough, C.J.! 
Now, I've had it with you!
- Relax.
- I've had it with these stories!
- Will you just relax?
- Sure, C.J.. What'd you see,
a man from Mars down there?
(gulls calling)
No more stories, C.J.! I've had it!
- Relax, relax! I'll talk to him.
(gulls calling)
Hey, partner.
- I'm not lying.
- Nobody says you're lying,
but you sure tell a mean story.
You know, you're getting a reputation
as the Cocoa Pinocchio.
These things are just like stories to you,
but you know, you really upset her.
It's hard on your mother, you know.
You're kinda the man of the house.
You gotta take care of her.
Do you understand?
- Swear on a stack of Bibles.
- Okay, C.J., let me take a look.
(soft music)
The guy down there walking all by himself,
is that the guy you saw?
(soft music)
- I don't know. I'm not sure.
- C.J.
- Nobody believes me.
(soft music)
Do you like my mom?
- I like your mom very much.
- You think you might marry her?
- What made you ask a question like that?
- Just curious.
- Hm?
- Just curious.
- How would you feel about that?
- I'd feel great.
What if you marry her?
Will you be my father
or something like that?
- You know what?
- What?
- I'd be very proud to be your father.
(soft music)

Oh, my God, I want you so bad.

- You were sleeping in my bed.
Stop it!

George?
George, is that you?

(George whimpering)
Takes me over!
- George, I'm your friend,
and it's important that you
tell me just where you are.
- It makes me do these things.
Bad.
- Listen to me, George.
It's only a dream, and
dreams can't hurt you.
(dramatic music)
Are you there, George?
- Daddy.
(hand slapping)

- I'm just hanging around.
I'm gonna feed my birds. Wanna help?
- Sure. Oh, I gotta go to my mom first.
But I'll be back.
- Wait, bring the other kids along, too.

- George is not here. I have known George.
George is my patient. I know his patterns.
I know the way he thinks.
- Paul, Paul, Paul.
- George doesn't even drive.
- I checked the family name, Paul.
- George can't be here.
- It's a very unusual name
in this neck of the woods.
- Look, we know that a
family with the same name
has lived in this area.
In fact, no, they've lived in several
different areas down here.
- Which is exactly why I had
such trouble tracking it.
But there is a connection.
- There is no connection.
- Paul, there is a solid connection.
This man is in Florida.
- Look, let me make it
real simple for you, Paul.
George's recurring dream?
Well, it's all in the police
records from 25 years ago.
- He's right, Paul.
- It really happened here.
His father, the woman he was with.
They were both killed. It
even talks about an ax.
It is the same person. It is George Tatum.
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, now, Paul, Paul, wait.
What we have to try and
do here is map out—
- We don't have to map out anything.
Now, Paul, you believed in these drugs,
and you rebuilt this man.
And you did put him
back out on the street.
But now he's out there Killing people.
And we can't have that.
Now, you find him
and you fix it.
- Kathy, I am desperate. I mean it.
I've called everybody in town.
I've called everybody there is.
Please, just come tonight.
It's a business party, for Bob.
We have to go. We have to make
an appearance, that's all.
I promised him. Please?
Oh, Kathy, he'll pay you $20,
and it'll be just two hours.
(Susan sighing)
I know that's what's bothering you.
No, C.J. will not...
He's promised he won't...
He won't cause any more
trouble. He won't do it again.
I'll be home in two hours.
Bob will pay you $20. 
I know you need the money.
(soft music)
Please, Kathy.
I'm desperate.
Just this once?
(soft flute music)
Oh, thank you.
Okay, I'll fix some dinner.

Thought you wanted some company.

I brought a joint over.

I just checked on 'em,
but what if they wake up?

We don't wanna make any noises.

I don't believe you.

How about going and get the joint for me?
It's over in my pants.

go take a shower.
