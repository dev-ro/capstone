After the terror wars,
Governments fell.
Corporations took control, 
fighting over what remained. 
Eight companies survived
 and divided up the world
Those companies were collectively 
known as IRON FIST 
The american territories fell 
to the mightiest corporation of all 
Tekken. 
Once a year, they hosted a tournament. 
which was no game. 
kill or be killed. 
Outside the walls of Tekken city
in the burned up slums they call the Anvil... 
That's where it all started. 
...

You're tough man! 
-- I used to watch you street fighting. 
-- That was for money. 
And this is for a cause. 
(don't get what he was saying about Heihachi Mishima)
treat us like slaves. 
I've got my own life,  
my own problems. 
I told you man, 
this asshole is a waste of time. No! No!
He's just another punk who'd rather die in the anvil 
and stand up like a man. 
Hey! Hey man!
Is everything prepared? 
Representative fighters
are on route from their home corporations. 
Good! Good!
I'm transferring command on Tekken Jack Hammer 
to you for the duration of the tournament.
Oh! father, I'm honored. 
Take the security in the Anvil in the outer sector
I will send additional units 
to patrol for anti-corporates surgents.
Not even minor inference 
will be tolerated. 
With respect ... 
I should have given the speech tonight. 
A chance to pass the torch, from father to son. 
When I think you're ready. 
-- I've been ready for years! 
-- Which Obvious to maintain security! 
Do not dissapoint me. 


I remember those moves. 
You Should. 
You were my best student. 
I was your only student, Mom! 
You hungry? 
I've been rushening protein squares. 
-- How bout an orange? 
-- Very funny! 
Coffee? 
You always talk about missing it so much. 
These must have cost a fortune! 
I can afford it. 
runs have been good. 
Jin, running anti tekken contra 
ban will get you killed. 
I could always enter 
"Iron Fist". 
make some real money. 
You will not have nothing to do with Tekken! 
Do you understand? 
I will not have you waste your talent. 
Well it wouldn't be a waste. 
It pays. 
And what difference does it make? 
Who cares 
where the money comes from? 
I care. 
This is not what I trained you for. 
And what the hell did you train me for? 
Did you think that life on the other side of that wall
will bring you happiness? 
-- Trust me! it won't. 
-- Oh! here we go.
The world burn because 
people had to have more
And this is better? 
Rushening protein squares? 
Is that what my father would have wanted for us? 
Don't! 
Why won't you ever talk about him? 
Your father is dead. 
That's all you need to know. 
You know what! forget it.
I'm outta here! 
There's a curfew tonight. 
There are Jacks everywhere! 
The Jacks are always everywhere! 
I am telling you! 
not to go!
Jin? 
Hey, Kara! 
Come here! 
-- Where have you been? 
-- been around... 
-- What is it? 
-- Chocolate. 
Are you serious? 
Sounds like I've been replaced. 
-- We cut it in yet? 
-- Another minute. 
We're dropping it on the west firewall. 
We'll be inside the Tekken video sub grip
for 60 seconds. 
We'll interrupt this program
to bring you the turf. 
No one understands 
how you're not dead. 
Guess I'm lucky. 
About to get lucky. 
I miss you. 
Wasn't easy back tracing your hack. 
It was smart to use not 
of Tekken's hardware  
Almost none. 
Now this, is an American classic. 
Your Revolution 
will not be televise. 
Oh shit! 
Jacks!
We gotta separate. 
You'll be fine. 
Sir, we've located the insurgent 
in sector 9. 
Burn everything! 
And everyone. 
-- But Sir, our men are still in there 
-- I don't care! Destroy it! 
You will have nothing to do with Tekken. 
Do you understand? 
I will not have you waste your talent. 
Tekken? 
Jin ... 
I should have been here! 
She asked me not to go! 
It's not your fault. 
-- Heihachi Mishima killed her! 
-- I know how you feel. 
My father was killed in 
the Jack Hammer raid. 
And what did anyone do about it? 
Nothing! 
What does anyone ever do about it? 
Nothing! 
He's gonna pay for what he has done 



Contestants for open call

You need to learn some respect. 

This kid doesn't have what it takes 
to stand up to Marshal Law. 
He's gonna be a roadkill! 


-- Break free! 
-- I can't! 
If you could still breathe
You could still fight. 
You're only beat to when you decide!
Again! 
Has just become the peoples choice. 
Respect! 
Do you hear it? 
I've never seen Marshall Law 
beaten by an amateur. 
Ratings are up. 
Our viewers love him. 
He represents the street. 
Let's see what the street is talking
Hey! Come on! give us some space. 
Move! come on! outta the way.
Give us some space
-- What's your name? 
-- Jin. 
-- Jin?
You know what you just did, Jin? 
You just beat a Tekken fighter. 
Hey! You say you're from the Anvil huh. 
Right ... 
So... Who taught you to fight? 
My mother. 
Huh!Your mother? 
No way! 
She's dead. 
Ei! You just won the only open slot in
"Iron Fist". 
Every other fighter in this tournament
has sponsors, everyone except you. 
Say, who care 
registration, paper work, training ... 
~blah blah blah~. 
I can take care of that for you. 
-- What's in it for you? 
-- I don't know... 30%.

I like your 'attitude, 
but No! 
20% and we're done. 
Fine!

I don't think so. 
Come on! 
I remember those moves. 
You should
You were my best student. 
You will have nothing to do with Tekken! 
Do you understand? 
The world burned because people had to have more
Tekken was built on people wanting more. 
What is the old man waiting for? 
I'm his son. 
His Heir. 
Tekken should be mine now. 
-- Kazuya! 
-- Father ... 
I see that. 
Explain yourself! 
We wiped out a fog of insurgents
I took a moment to unwind . 
You should be making preparations
for Iron Fist
Everythings been taken cared of. 
After all this time, 
and you still don't understand. 
Winning Iron Fist 
means ~~~ for Tekken!
And honor for the Mishima name! 
Winning here means 
we win the world. 
So you said? 
Ei! you stay close to me Ok!

Jin! the People's Choice!

Steve Fox. 
Back from the Anvil 
Ohh! We both know Tekken city is my home. 
Of course ... 
I've heard you find your expertise 
To a new fighter. 
Let me introduce you. 
This is Jin, people's choice. 
Well congratulations on a
spectacular fight. 
You've impressed my father 
It's not an easy task. 
I'd like to thank 
Mr. Mishima in person. 
For this opportunity. 
Well continue winning, 
and you will. 
There's something familliar 
about your style. 
Did your father ever fight in Iron Fist? 
Didn't know my father. 
Another common in the Anvil. 
Work hard, keep training 
Someday you could be an asset to Tekken. 
I'll never belong to Tekken. 
We'll see about that ... 
What was that? 
Just -- Just do your job! 
Defeat is a choice. 
So is victory. 
You're only beat to when you decide. 
Again! 
I gotta get out of here for a while. 
Thought that was against the rules. 
Not! if you don't get caught. 
That Jin, people's choice 
Entering the club. 
Let's go! Give it up! 
-- Ei Jin, you were great today! 
-- Thank you. 
Three days ago, I got Gang Bang
tried to kill me. 
Then today you're a celebrity,
Get used to it. 
So what happened up there with Rojo? 
I beat him! 
That's what happened. 
You did more than just beat him. 
You almost killed him. 
Can I give you a little advise? 
Iron Fist isn't about killing 
or getting yourself killed. 
So You brought me here to warn me? 
I'm just saying...
Attitude like that is gonna get you in trouble. 
Guess I should be more in-control. 
Like you... 
You don't know anything about me. 
You grew up just outside 
the American territories. 
Your grandfather thought you how to fight. 
Entered you into amateur leagues. 
Made you a champion. 
I've seen you in the Iron Fist promos. 
Were those promos just 
showcase on my skills. 
Ok! he's gone. 
-- I shouldn't ... 
-- I think you should. 
I need sleep. 
I may have to kick your 
ass tommorow morning. 
You Promise? 
Go to bed! 
Jin! 
Stand up for Christ sake! 
I knew it!
They weren't because they actually
believe that you have a shot.
Nothing changes. 
There's no way, no way they're gonna 
let someone from the Anvil win the Iron Fist.
Maybe it has to do with 
something else. 
Where did you get this? 
Belonged to my mother. 
Jun Kazama. 
I knew her! 
You knew her? 
We were in Iron Fist together. 
That's not possible! 
She was a Tekken fighter Jin.
 She was good. 
You don't know what 
you're talking about. 
Every single thing about 
your mother was unique 
Even her fighting style. 
Why didn't she say anything? 
Why would she lie to me? 
Maybe she was trying 
to protect you Jin. 
Listen to me Jin. 
Right now you need to get out of here,
go underground.
She's right. 
I'm not leaving! 
-- Forget Iron Fist. 
-- I don't give a damn about Iron Fist! 
I came here to kill 
Heihachi Mishima. 
Do you know what a nightmare this is? 
I think you worry too much. 
Don't talk back to me! 
You failed me! 
He's still alive! 
It was a fluke! 
It won't happen again. 
No! 
You are underestimating him! 
And now, I have to clean up your mess 
Stay where the TV cameras can see you. 
they won't try anything 
if the world is watching,  
Christie Monteiro. 
Nina Williams! 
I think it was her. 
What? 
Nina Williams. 
She was one of the assasins. 
Good to know. 
I'm a little late last night? 
I like your boyfriend 
he's cute! 
Sorry. 
I don't share. 
A $100,000 Global dollars to 
whoever kills that kid from the Anvil.
What makes you think 
I need your money? 
Replacing bone with a Flex steel 
isn't cheap, is it right? 
Neither is the maintenance ... 
-- So no wonder 
you could punch through wall.
-- I am
But the corporations made me. 
As I recall, Bio-enhancements 
are illegal in Iron Feast. 
Christ, Brian! 
you're half robot. 
You'll be banned for life. 
Log in the fights selector. 
-- What are the Jacks doing here? 
-- Extra security. 
There was an incident inside 
the barracks last night. 
I read the report. 
Insurgent forces inside Tekken. 
There is no reason for concern. 
I dealt with the problem. 
personally. 
I don't want anything to 
happen to this youg fighter.
Hey! How you feeling? 
Good ... 
Jin! the people's Choice! 
Let me see! 
=Transmission= 
Yoshimitsu! 
Ei, I have something for you. 
My old power gloves. 
Well, it's been a long time. 
A little worst for wear now ... 
Give me your hand. 
It gonna keep this safe. 
When you're out there today 
you stay smart Ok!? 
You gotta bob, you gotta weed,
you gotta fly if you have to. 
But you don't let Yoshimitsu 
touch you! Ever.
Take him! 
Nice! 
Re-cycle the challenges selection. 
What are you doing? 
This match is better suited for 
the semi final. 
No! 
You can't do that! 
These two have to fight, now! 
-- Are you questioning me? 
-- No! I'm replacing you! 
Jacks! 
What are you doing? Stand down! 
You put me incharge of security. 
Remember Father? 
The Jack Hammers answer to me! 
Kazuya, do not do this!
It's done! 
I'm through waiting. 
Tekken is mine! 
Maintain the original fight selection. 
Jesus! 
Yoshimitsu is the past
Iron Fist champion. 
Look at the ratings,
through the roof! 
You see the only thing audience is
craving more than blood...
Is death. 
You see father, I have learned. 
Yoshimitsu is out for blood. 
He's decimating him. 
Stop the fight! 
There is no honor in this! 
You are about to witness the 
death of Jin Kazama. 
Kazama? 
Apparently the bi-product of one 
of my youthful indiscretions. 
You have a son! 
I had a son! 
=Security Alert= 
=Security Alert=
Destroy the mask of death.
and you will see there is nothing  
behind that you fear.
Damn you old man! 
You will regret this! 
Take him! 
Not in the mist! 
Jin, take this off! 
We gotta get him out of 
Tekken city. 
Iron Fist fighters are 
to be detained. 
Jesus! 
They arrested Mishima! 
We need to get out of here now. 
Come on, Let's go! 
You can't arrest us! 
We're Iron Fist fighters. 
Get in there! 
-- His shoulder is dislocation. 
-- Give a hand over here! 
-- Why the hell are you looking at me? 
-- you wanna help here? 
Just do it! 
let's get you up! he's gonna... Ok!? 
Ok... On...
-- Three! 
-- Thank's! 
What are you trying to do? 
My father always stress the 
importance of Iron Fist. 
Frankly I never saw the value. 
It was a brutal mindless game. 
But I finally understand. 
In the arena, perception is power. 
After the audience thought 
that Jin killed Yoshimitsu! 
Raitings fight to their 
highest level ever. 
Which is why I decided...
that the remainder of the tournaments fights,
will be to the death. 
I am sure you'd all rather 
die fighting in the arena 
Iron Fist
continues tomorrow. 
I suggest you get some rest! 
So what now? 
We kill or be killed. 
We have a choice. 
If there are no fighters, 
there is no tournament and no one has to die. 
Alright! line up against the wall! 
Hands behind your back! 
Hands behind your back! I said.
I don't think so! 
Come on! Let's move! 
Now! 
This way! come on! 
Lock us down! 
Mishima ... 
-- Mishima ... 
-- Take it easy Jin! 
-- Jin Kazama
-- You owe me a life Mishima. 
I owe you nothing young man 
How does it feel to be behind bars? 
We gotta move! 
I'm gonna need those access codes. 
right now! 
Get me out of here! 
I can help! 
Key! 
This way old man! 
Heihachi Mishima is with them. 
They're heading towards 
the workers access gate. 
Anvil: Green Zone 
Tau sector 
Move it! come on! 
-- Take it easy, you ok?
-- Are you ok? 
-- Yes! I'm alive. 
Kazuya will be sending the Jack Hammers. 
I know a safe house. 
It's Not far. 
So maybe I'm crazy. 
Can we go?! 
Come on!
Tear the Anvil apart! 
I want the fighters found,
and recaptured. 
Go! 
Rest! 
A moment! 
I knew your mother 
Jun Kazama. 
Formidable fighter. 
One of Tekken's best. 
My mother tried to keep 
me away from Tekken.
Now I know why. 
Do not judge all of Tekken 
by Kazuya's mistakes. 
Mistakes? 
Tekken destroys lives! 
I created Tekken, not only as a corporation 
that is immune to stand the chaos  
We are remaking the world,
Rasing it from the ashes. 
You tell that to the people die, 
everyday, in the Anvil. 
We brought humanity back from the brink. 
We restored order. 
-- Tekken is peace. 
-- Tekken is fear! 
My mother's blood is 
on your hands Mishima! 
I saved your mother's life. 
What the hell, are you talking about? 
Many years ago after the tournament, 
I found her beaten, violated.
I'm the one that had to take
her from Tekken city. 
It was always the sadistic part of him, 
that I could never control. 
Who? 
Kazuya ... my son. 
Your father. 
You're lying! 
Until today, there was only one 
heir to the Tekken throne. 
Now there are two. 
Jacks! 
Get down, Jin! 
Run! Run!
What? 
You thought I'd do nothing? 
Tekken belongs to me! 
You never understood the 
spirit of Tekken. 
That's why I could not place 
Tekken in your hands. 
Tekken is in my hands old man!
Don't you see? 
It's over for you now! 
It's not about me or you. 
It's about the Mishima name. 
A name that you have not lived up to. 
And that's why, in the end, 
you will fail. 
Take Heihachi Mishima away. 
Destroy everything! 
Including him! 
I am Mishima Heihachi. 
I am Tekken. 
Heihachi Mishima is dead. 
Citizens of Tekken and the world. 
Today, Iron Fist will make history. 
And you will be histories witness! 
The remaining fighters will no longer
fight for the simple glory of victory. 
Now! they will fight, as we all must fight.
Everyday we draw breath.
They will fight for their lives! 
They Will fight to the death. 
Sergei Dragunov 
and Brian Fury! 
In the first round of the 
Iron Fist semi-final.
What? No hug for your old man? 
I remember your mother. 
She put up quite a fight. 
Frankly, if I knew that whore
was pregnant, 
I would kill her right then and there. 
You want to kill me don't you? 
I understand that. 
But in order to get to me, 
you'll have to kill the champion. 
Brian Fury. 
That's how Iron Fist works. 
Get off of me! 
Imagine, what I'll do to her
If you don't fight! . 
You will fight
The world will watch! 
And my legacy will be 
written with your blood. 
Take her! 
When the time comes, 
I pray you die screaming! 
Behave yourself! 
Jin, I saw what you did to Rojo. 
You let your anger take control in you. 
Anger doesn't feel the fighters soul, 
it incinerate. 
But before that I saw something. 
I saw greatness in you. 
You're not just fighting 
for yourself anymore Jin,
you're fighting for all of us. 
You can become champion. 
There are a lot of people depending on it. 
-- So... Who taught you to fight? 
-- My mother. 
Attack! 
Your mother? 
She's dead. 
Do you think that life on the other
side of that wall will bring you happiness? 
Trust me, it won't. 
I told you this asshole is 
a waste of time! 
He's just another punk 
who'd rather die in the Anvil
and stand up like a man. 
But you are Jin is a believer in the cause,
you just don't know it. 
So... you're the people's choice? 
You don't look like much. 
My father was killed in the 
Jack Hammer raid. 
And what did anyone do about it?
Nothing!
One day you'll have a 
chance to make a difference. 
That's why I trained you so hard. 
Because one day, you will not just be fighting 
for you and me. 
You'll be fighting for all of us. 
I love you, jin! 
Brian Fury vs Jin! 
the people's Choice! 
It all comes down to this moment. 
Two fighters remained. 
Brian Fury and Jin, 
the people's choice. 
Ain't nothing gonna save 
you now boy! 
It's been a hell of a 
run for this young fighter. 
But, can he last against Brian Fury? 
Every opponent 
has it's weakness. 
See it! 
exploit it! 
Strike! 
Jin, come on Jin! 
Yes! 
Did you see that? 
This kid is full of surprises! 
Enough! 
Introduce me, the Final Match! 
No! 
Jin won! 
He's the champion! 
You can't kill him! 
Watch me! 
Now entering the arena, fighting for 
the honor of the Tekken Corporation.
Kazuya Mishima! 
I should thank you. 
You're coming here giving me the opportunity
to take control of Tekken.
Your mother taught you any styles. 
All quite strong. 
Yes! 
There it is! 
The lust for vengeance! 
The hunger to kill! 
Like fire, coursing through your veins. 
You can't deny it Jin! 
It's what makes 
you who you are! 
The curse of the Mishima blood 
Like father, like son! 
It's your curse, not mine! 
You won! 
Citizens of Tekken and the world. 
I give you Jin Kazama! 
The winner of Iron Fist. 
The people's Choice! 
Now the people's champion! 
I never thought I'd 
live to see this day
You have got to say that that
is the greatest champion ever 
Drinks on the house, 
It's on me! 
Where you gonna go? 
It's time to go home. 
On that day, the house of Mishima fell. 
Tyranny had been challenge and defeated. 
And the name Kazama became synonymous 
with hope, strength and freedom. 
But freedom comes and goes. 
And the world have no idea all morning that the true
legacy of Tekken's only just beginning. 
I am Mishima Heihachi. 
I am Tekken! 
You will obey!
