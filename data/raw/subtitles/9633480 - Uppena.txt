Your voice is the embodiment of a song.
You may have departed from this world.
But your voice will live on forever.
Love you and thank you
for everything, dear sir.
If love is really so great,
it belongs only
in history books and graveyards.
If love turns into marriage
and begets a family,
it won't be great at all.
That's why,
love exists only in history.
It doesn't have a future
in the society.
What do you say?
UPENNA
PRESENT DAY 2002
{\an8}KOTAGIRI SESHARAYANAM
DISTRICT COUNCIL CHAIRMAN
{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY
KOTAGIRI SESHARAYANAM
{\an8}-Govindu?
-Sir.
{\an8}It's 7 a.m. Drop Bebamma at the college.
{\an8}Hey!
Get Bebamma's clothes ready.
-Bebamma is leaving for college.
-Is that so?
It's Bebamma.
Hey, Ninety Prakasha.
Let's go take a peek at Bebamma.
If Rayanam comes to know,
we will be dead.
We'll make sure that we don't get caught.
Come on.
Come on, speed up! Faster!
Move a little closer. That's it.
Stop badgering me.
Let me drive.
-We must see her today at any cost.
-Sure, just be patient.
The car is leaving. Catch up.
Come on.
How dare you follow Bebamma's car?
How dare you follow Bebamma?
Please...
We'll never do this again.
Looks like these rogues
were chasing after Bebamma.
They are done for.
Please let me take
the first hour class for Section B.
No. You took all the first hour
classes last week.
Please, ma'am.
I am feeling a bit weak.
No, that's not possible.
Please.
All right. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Students,
today, our topic is benzene.
This is about ecological classification
of plants.
Bebamma is a really nice person.
She gifted new clothes to my child
and gave me 1,000 rupees.
My master is such a miser.
The mandal revenue officer is here.
Mr. Rayanam?
Mr. Rayanam?
Officer, what brings you here?
Mr. Rayanam is upstairs.
Please take a seat, sir.
There's no time for that.
These are property documents
which date back 150 years.
I got all of them.
Now, Mr. Rayanam can easily proceed
with his fishing yard construction.
Go and call him.
All right, sir.
It's been 40 minutes.
Ask him to hurry.
He'll be here shortly.
Please be patient.
Hey, how long will you take to unload?
Mr. Rayanam?
Mr. Rayanam?
Bebamma...
Enough with the studies today, dear.
It's already quite late.
Drink this milk and go to bed.
Enough, sweetheart.
Keep those books aside.
Listen to me.
Drink some milk and go to bed.
You are my darling, aren't you?
I am talking to you.
Listen to me.
Drink up.
Enough with the studies today.
It's seven o'clock. Get Bebamma ready.
So, students...
She gave me 1,000 rupees.
Sir...
-You shouldn't be here. Come on.
-There's no one there.
-He's talking to an empty chair.
-She is right there.
-Is everyone here so crazy?
-Please leave.
-Any stranger can tell you the truth.
-Please leave--
Mr. Rayanam.
Mr. Rayanam. Sir...
I made a mistake.
Please forgive me, sir...
Mr. Rayanam.
Sir...
I believe that my daughter is right here.
And the people in my house believe it.
An entire village believes it.
Now, you want to go out
and tell the world
that my daughter isn't here.
Aren't you breaking our belief?
If it's a choice between
killing our belief system or killing you
I will kill you.
Mr. Rayanam...
What do you say?
I can see Bebamma as well.
Mr. Rayanam...
I have been your trusted aide
We both are from the same caste.
Throw him out, guys.
Come, sir. Why didn't you do this before?
You fool!
Why did you thrash that revenue office?
He just spoke the truth.
It's been almost five months
since your daughter left the house.
You've been making the entire village
believe that she is still at home.
You never had to worry
about your honor.
It's because you had a son
along with a daughter.
No matter where she went
during the day,
your son would bring her back home
by nightfall.
But, Father, I have a daughter.
When I don't know where she is,
it is so hard for me to go out
with my head held high.
Do you know that?
If I find him, he will be finished.
If not, I will die.
What do you say?
A FEW MONTHS AGO
Heave ho! Heave ho!
Abbulu, you have a fever.
Why did you come here?
Doctor! You prick!
You poked my butt.
You have a fever.
I told you not to come to work.
Who will feed me then? Will you?
If you don't go home,
I'll poke you again.
-I'll give the prescription to your wife.
-Get lost.
I wonder if we can catch
a decent haul of fish.
Did you catch anything, guys?
Damn!
Again, we couldn't catch any fish.
Damn! It's the same ocean
and the same kind of boat.
They've gotten lucky.
And we are unlucky.
Do we have to go back
empty-handed today as well?
Why should we go back empty-handed?
Let's go and cut up their nets.
Then, we all can go back empty-handed.
What's this?
Why is the net so light?
Hey!
Those Mayapatnam people
tore up our nets again!
Hey, Aasi!
Aasi, they are running away.
Go faster!
Aasi. Stop it.
Stop fighting. Stop it.
How dare you come to our place
and tear up our nets? You...
Crap!
How dare you both do it, huh?
There are four of us.
Why do you say two?
-Because "four" has four letters.
-So?
He stutters while speaking that word.
That's why,
he is splitting up the four of you
in two pairs and warning you.
Pay compensation for the nets
and the lost fish.
Pay it up! Pay up!
Why should we?
Did you see us ripping your nets?
-What nonsense! Pay up.
-No, we won't. Why should we?
-Hit them.
-We won't pay.
We are not going to pay.
Just because we have knives,
it doesn't mean we tore up your nets.
Did you see us do it?
Hey, Thalimpu.
The bus is coming into the village.
Come on, let's go to the college.
I'll take a bath and be back.
-Go get ready.
-Okay.
-I've seen a nice dress in the market.
-What did your mother say?
-Asked me to snatch your pitcher.
-My water!
Go away.
Stop there!
Nookalamma, what happened?
He stole my water. Jackass!
Get lost.
Why are you always after him?
Don't you have better things to do?
Where is my shirt? I can't find it.
I heard you got into a scuffle
with the people from Mayapatnam.
Stop doing this so early
in the morning, Dad.
I'm searching for my shirt.
Which shirt?
Aasi, come soon.
Where is it?
Which shirt?
This one!
Wait! Hold on.
-I am wearing it.
-I ironed it last night.
-Listen to me. I need to go out.
-Take it off, Dad.
Don't you have any other shirt?
-No.
-What's wrong with you?
Look, what you've done.
It's all crumpled.
Aasi...
Before leaving,
read a passage from the Bible, please.
It's filled with words
I can't pronounce.
Leave out the words you can't pronounce
and read out the rest.
I have a lot of work to do.
-How much longer?
-Look in the front.
Is the bus coming?
Yes, it is coming.
Hurry up!
-Do I look good?
-Let's go.
The bus is leaving.
It is leaving.
Start the bike.
-Let's go.
-Get on.
Drive! Quick.
{\an8}Is she on this side?
No, I think she is on the other side.
Go!
All right.
{\an8}The driver might notice us.
Be careful.
Keep going.
Hey... What happened?
What happened to the motorbike?
The bike's given up on us.
Damn it!
Look out! Be careful!
All right.
I understood that God
is the one who grants wishes.
It's never a secret who we are born to.
As a child, I realized
who I am meant to be with.
{\an8}BASHEER BIBI FESTIVAL
BANGARU PAPA THEERTHAM
Suddenly, I felt a rush to grow up.
Either to seek her love,
or die after failing to win her heart.
Mom.
You look amazing!
-Kanakam.
-Yes, sir.
Where are my glasses?
Where are you guys?
Your grandfather is a piece of work.
He keeps yelling at me all day.
-Hey, Kanakam!
-I'm coming.
Don't get irritated, Kanakam.
You will become old soon,
like my grandfather.
-Kanakam!
- Grandpa...
Don't be angry, Grandpa.
Anger will make you age faster.
-All right.
-Sit here.
I am old because I have aged.
I didn't grow old because of anger.
No, Grandpa, you look older than your age.
Really?
My seventh grade teacher told me
that when we get angry,
our body releases some hormones
which cause wrinkles on our skin.
You always get angry.
That's why,
even when I was a kid,
you had looked very old.
Hey, stop.
Finally, you have succeeded.
You persuaded your dad
and joined a college in town.
For the first time,
there's a bus coming to this village.
It's exclusively for you.
You are so beautiful.
You have a good build.
Why do you have to carry this weight?
Give me the bag.
Come on, give it.
-Give me.
-Please.
Leave me alone, Jana.
Hey, Bebamma.
-Nookalamma?
-Yes, Father?
What was the God's word last week?
I forgot, Father.
It looks like the Father
is annoyed with her.
Shut up, Thalimpu.
Everyone, get your Bibles out.
It's usual to avoid the dad
of the girl you love.
But you're avoiding the girl that
you've been in love with for a decade.
You are madly in love with her.
If I meet her once and propose to her,
she might say "yes" or "no".
If she says no,
I may never see her again.
That's why I love her from afar.
That's your logic.
But you drag me along with you.
And I'm getting tired of this charade.
Hey, Thalimpu! Keep quiet.
Oh, God! The Father is angry.
Genesis, chapter three.
In the beginning, God created Adam.
Later, when Adam was lazing around
all the time,
God was worried
that he would turn into an idiot.
So, God called Adam and said,
"It might hurt, but bear with it."
God broke one of Adam's ribs
and created Eve.
According to the Bible,
that is how a woman came into existence.
So, if we want a girl,
we must break our ribs.
Is that what he said?
But why is it said that girls
are born to the people who lie?
Really?
If liars really beget girl children,
then it makes me wonder
what it must have taken
to beget a beauty like her.
Maybe her father committed
a worse crime like murder.
Sir.
It's way too sweet, Govindam.
-Sir.
-There's too much sugar in it.
I'm sorry.
I'll get you another cup.
Not necessary.
Get me a handful of sugar.
If the mouth is sweetened,
the tea wouldn't taste so sweet.
If you want to deal with something,
you need not sabotage everything.
We just have to remove the things
that we don't like.
What do you say?
Doctor.
You usually write prescriptions
for people in the village.
Now, you and your friend wrote a complaint
against me to the collector.
Is that true?
Well, that's true.
I asked him to write it.
You're trying to rob us of our homes.
Where would we go?
We might be using your boats.
But the ocean
is not your personal property.
We are against the fishing yard.
Rayanam Fishing Yard is not
being built because of my need.
It's my pride.
Sir, they are simpletons.
If you evict these folks overnight,
their families will end up on the streets.
Who told you that they
were simpletons, doctor?
If they really were that simple,
they would pick up the fishes
washed ashore.
They wouldn't go into
the ocean to catch fish.
I won't let this happen while I'm alive.
Just because you have a voice,
don't think that you can raise it
against me.
I will not just cut you down,
I will also cut out the organ
that lets you speak.
It looks like the fear
in your voice is alive.
The courage inside you
must have already died.
Go and live.
Oh, my gosh!
Aunt, my mom always used to tell me
that you became bedridden
without producing a male heir.
That's why my uncle is upset with you.
Even though you got paralyzed
during childbirth,
you gave birth to a beautiful daughter
for my sake.
And she blossomed into a buxom beauty.
Just once...
Hey, you!
Mom! What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened, Aunt?
What happened, Bebamma?
I told you not to touch me.
I'll keep touching you
even if you tell me not to.
Take your hand off me.
Dad...
Dad...
Even though I told Jana
to stop touching me,
he still does it.
Why don't you hit him once and warn him?
-What's going on?
-It's nothing, Uncle.
It just happened accidentally,
and she is making a scene.
Okay, go to college.
-Let's go, Officer.
-Okay.
Is it my fault that I was born a girl?
I keep telling Dad to sternly warn Jana,
but he doesn't lift a finger.
He only cares about his reputation.
He doesn't pay attention to you.
Why would he pay attention to me?
Why are you sad, Mom?
Don't worry even if your husband
doesn't help us.
Once I get married,
my husband will thrash that guy.
Corpus spongiosum.
This is corpus spongiosum.
It's just a description
of a man's anatomy.
This isn't a definition of man.
Ramya, why are you laughing?
Get up.
Tell me, what is this?
Manhood, ma'am.
Manhood?
Sit, sit.
If you don't mind a zoology lecturer
veering off into philosophy,
I'll tell you something.
In every woman's life, there comes a man.
If a woman can feel that man's love
for every moment of her life,
that is real manhood.
If a girl feels that having him
by her side is so fulfilling
that she doesn't need anything else
in life, that is manhood.
Manhood is not a mere organ
in a man's body.
It exists in every cell of his body.
You should be able to see that.
No one can handle erections lifelong.
But emotions can be handled lifelong.
Thalimpu, see if the bus is coming.
Of course, it will come.
It can't fly off above our heads,
like an airplane.
I heard that you guys ganged up
and attacked some boys from my village.
Didn't they tell you that it was one guy
who whacked them all?
Well said.
Do you think we'll stay quiet
if you cut up our fishing nets?
If you're so worried about nets,
then I wonder
what you will do if we uproot
your entire village.
Another word from any of you,
and I'll kick your a...
I'll break your glasses.
Glasses? Why did he say glasses?
He can't pronounce that word. So, you guys
didn't understand that he cussed you.
Look at that arrogant prick.
He can't speak without stuttering,
and yet he's arrogant.
A...
A... Ass. We'll tear your ass apart.
The bus is coming. Let's go.
Hey! Are you scared, you bastard?
Hit that bastard!
Come on! Come on, you idiots!
Look over there.
There is a fight going on.
See how angry he is.
He will become old soon.
It looks like Bebamma's college bus.
Bebamma, come out.
Bebamma.
-It's a traffic jam. I'll take you home.
-No.
-Who are you, man?
-Shut up!
Didn't you hear me?
-Come, let's go.
-Please, let go of me.
-I said, let's go.
-I don't want to.
Come on.
-Let go of me, Jana.
-Come on.
Come on.
Come on, you bastard.
How dare you cuss my father!
Buddy, Bebamma is looking at you.
Bebamma saw you.
Come on.
Come at me.
Let's get in.
Look towards the bus.
This guy should never age.
Bro, Bebamma is looking at you.
Yes, she is.
-That's what I've been telling you.
-She's looking at me.
Hey!
Corpus spongiosum!
-She is calling you in English.
-Yes, she is.
That is what I've been telling you.
She looked at me.
She noticed me.
Hey! Usually, you'll get irritated
if I touch you in my sleep.
And today, you are all over me.
Nothing, Dad. Go to sleep.
-What happened?
-Nothing.
Why did you get into a fight them?
If he'd cussed me, I would've ignored it.
But he cussed you.
I wish your mother was here to advise you.
She would have told you
not to get into fights, son.
When did you see Mom
for the first time, Dad?
Well, they said that I should get married.
And took me to a place
and made me sit in a hut.
They brought in a girl.
Your grandpa didn't want
his daughter to marry me
as I didn't own
a fishing net of my own.
When my mother and I were returning home,
that girl stalked us and confronted us.
Then she gave me a titillating look.
That's it.
I borrowed money, bought a fishing net
and married your mother.
So if a girl gives you a titillating look,
should you marry her?
I have to go fishing in the morning.
So, go to bed.
Dad! Dad! Did Mom really
give you a titillating look?
Yes, she gave me a titillating look.
Please go to sleep now.
-Dad...
-I beg you.
-Did Mom really give you such a look?
-My God! Please stop it!
Yes, she did give me that look.
Please...
-Did she really look at you like that?
-Please go to sleep.
Oh, God...
Kothapalli Padma.
Hold your bag.
If I don't pick up the rations today,
my wife will lash at me.
-Shankaram?
-Yes, Govindu.
-Add two extra kilos for each item.
-Okay.
Sir?
I am talking to you, sir.
-What is it?
-All of us are standing in line.
-Stand in line.
-How dare you raise your voice?
FAIR PRICE SHOP
Why get into a fight with Govindu?
I just asked him to stand in line.
I should stand in a line?
-What?
-Rascal!
-What...
-Aasi!
Govindu.
Go and stand in the line.
Yesterday, Bebamma told her servant
to stand in line at the shop.
She again looked at me in a special way.
You are getting lucky.
Why did the bus stop?
-The driver is getting down.
-Do you think he noticed us?
Yes. Why else would he stop?
Oh, goodness! I fear the worst now.
-I'm going to pee now.
-Don't worry. I'll deal with him.
Hey, you!
Where are you from?
I just got down to pee, sir.
We are from Uppada.
Oh, you guys are from Uppada!
Nothing.
The bus broke down.
-Bebamma has to take an exam.
-Bebamma?
I see no auto rickshaws around.
Can you drop her at her college?
We can't do that, man.
-Please listen to me.
-Nagaraju!
-Yes, Bebamma.
-Did you find any auto rickshaw?
I asked somebody I know for help.
If you don't mind...
Why would I get on a stranger's... bike?
Here you go.
-Do you think this is a scooter?
-No.
You start it.
-Ma'am.
-Yes?
-Washroom.
-Okay, go.
Come on, go.
Why do you put me through this?
You have been at it for days.
Don't say that.
You've followed her enough.
At least today, muster up the courage
and go and talk to her.
Bebamma?
-Call her loudly.
-Bebamma!
She is coming here. She is coming.
Talk to her.
Bebamma? Why do you say Bebamma?
My name is not Bebamma.
Her name is not Bebamma?
What? Isn't your name Bebamma?
-No?
-No.
Ask for her name.
Hey, Bebamma. What's your name?
She didn't react at all.
If you don't tell me your name,
I will get angry.
Would you like it if I age quickly?
Do you want me to get old soon?
Buddy, she is writing something.
Yes.
"San...
"Gee...
"Tha...
Sangeetha.
SANGEETHA
San...
G...
G...
Tha...
Santha!
Santha?
This will be the biggest hurdle ever.
Santha!
Santha!
Damn it! Say "Sangeetha."
-Did I say it correctly?
-Of course not! Try it again.
Go ahead. Say "Sangeetha."
I did it.
Where?
-Under the water.
-Under the water?
I was the one who said it.
Sang... tha!
It's enough. Let's go.
Looks like Bebamma is not lucky enough
to hear you her call her name lovingly.
-Get lost!
-Oh, goodness!
Santha!
Damn!
Yuck!
Oh, Dad!
The same old fish curry again today?
It's irritating.
What happened, son?
Maybe I got my stutter
because of eating too much fish.
And, it's only getting worse.
Don't be so angry, son.
I shouldn't get angry.
I shouldn't.
If I get angry, I will get age quickly.
Dad.
What?
Don't take things to heart.
If you do, you'll get old quickly.
Okay?
Santha!
You can't speak your heart out
to your beloved.
You can only speak with your stutter.
-That's why I'm doing this.
-What is it?
A book about love and a blank paper.
What will you do with them?
I'll fill this sheet
about love from this book.
My goodness! Okay, go on. Fill it up.
Love should be like
the love story of Laila and Majnu,
Devdas and Parvati,
Romeo and Juliet...
It should be very special and unique.
I know about Devadas,
and I know about Majnu.
But who is the male character
in Romeo and Juliet?
-Who knows?
-Oh! Even you don't know!
Ro-me-o.
Ju-Li-et.
The "et" in Juliet is emphatic.
So, Juliet must be a man.
-Are you sure?
-I am sure.
Once this page is filled with your love,
you will join those legends, Aasi.
Of course, I will.
As long as Rayanam
doesn't get wind of this, it's all fine.
But if he does,
it'll be a different story.
Well, we can certainly write the letter.
But who is going to give it to her?
My goodness!
Don't involve me in this in any way.
I swear to God I can't do this.
Why do you drag God into this?
Oh, Goddess!
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Aasi told me to give this to you.
-Thalimpu, I am very nervous.
-Why?
-Do you think she read my letter?
-Maybe.
-Will she come here?
-I'm sure she'll come to this festival.
The festival won't begin
until Rayanam comes and offers clothes.
Bebamma is here, bro.
Sir, we need to talk to you
regarding Waqf Board lands.
You didn't have to write that letter.
You look so nervous.
If you go to her now
she will know
that you're in love with her.
Buddy, she is looking at you.
-She is calling you. Go.
-I won't.
-Buddy, just go.
-No.
-She is calling you. Just go.
-I'm scared. Why don't you come along?
She called only you.
You can't take me along now.
Go now.
Everybody, be ready.
In a short while, we will distribute
the holy sandalwood paste.
What's up?
You asked for my name
and walked away silently.
Well, the thing is...
This is the letter you gave me.
Read it.
-Thalimpu.
-Yes.
To ensure that my stutter
doesn't ruin my love,
fill this letter with my words.
G...
That syllable may escape my throat.
Let's see how it can escape my letter.
All right, listen up then.
After you came into my life,
my heart began to celebrate.
It's a sheer delight
to hear you say that syllable.
-Go on, proceed.
-All right, I will.
-I've filled it up as you've asked.
-Is it good?
Don't worry.
This letter will simply floor the girl.
No girl will fall
for such a lousy love letter.
Instead, you'll be laughed at.
I didn't write this letter to woo you.
I did it to make you laugh.
The words in that letter
might appear borrowed.
But since my childhood,
I have always had a strong liking for you.
I've been telling the same to myself.
Strong liking, huh?
What do you mean?
It has started, come on.
It means...
Doctor, he's been shivering since last
night. Did he get scared of something?
I heard you got a fever.
Your father is very worried.
When I told Bebamma that I liked her,
she didn't say a word.
Instead, she kissed me and left.
Kissed you?
And that too, a special kind of kiss.
You told her that you loved her.
And she said she loved you too,
through a kiss.
-Are there any scars?
-What's the matter?
Last night, you appeared in my dream,
and I pinched you.
There's no marks.
"Love you I?"
Hey!
You wrote it wrong.
Shouldn't it be "I love you"?
I don't want "love" to keep us apart.
So, I set love aside.
"Love you I."
So "you" and "I" will always be together.
A toothbrush?
Yes, this what I use to brush my teeth.
From tomorrow onwards, use this one.
San... gee... tha...
Say it.
San... g...
Bebamma!
Aasi, look!
See how I sweat
when I sit next to you.
Aasi, I won't be able to meet you
for the next three days.
I can't bear to be away from you.
Let me give you a kiss.
You will then catch a fever.
And you can go home and rest.
Okay?
It's been three days since I saw Bebamma.
Does this shirt look good?
Greetings.
Dasu, come with us.
-Dad, let me come with you.
-Why?
-Let me come.
-What for?
-Please, let me join you.
-Fine. Let's go.
This is going to be the last meeting
regarding your houses. Go on.
He is too arrogant.
Greetings.
I am Aasi.
I don't know if Bebamma
has told you about me.
But she always talks about you.
Bebamma loves you a lot.
If you don't mind,
I will go and meet Bebamma once.
Rayanam might benefit a lot
from the construction of the fishing yard.
But the fact is, you all
stand to gain more than him.
Your children's future will be bright.
You can stay far out and venture
into the ocean when needed.
Rayanam will talk to the government
to ensure that you all receive
new houses.
Try to understand.
Officer, this is unfair.
We depend on the sea for our livelihood.
You're telling us to live miles away
from the village and the sea.
How is that possible?
But it makes no difference at all,
does it?
How can you say that, sir?
Our houses are on the raised shoreline,
and we've been used to that.
All these years,
the sea has always greeted us pleasantly,
but it has never uprooted our houses.
Our lives are just like that of a fish.
If you keep us away from water,
we won't be able to live at all.
We cannot survive without
the salty air of the ocean.
Please have mercy on us.
Whether you wish to go out
into the ocean on boats,
or earn a living to feed yourselves,
it all depends on my mercy.
-Sir--
-No. Impossible.
We object to the construction
of the fishing yard.
What did you say?
Aasi, how did you come here?
What if someone sees you?
Do you think this is a joke, and you
can go back and forth like an ocean wave?
It's the government.
Once it makes up its mind,
there is no turning back.
It will do what it wants.
Anything else?
Why did you come here?
You've been coming to meet me every day.
So, for a change, I wanted to visit you.
Aren't you scared?
I wasn't a while ago.
But now I am.
Do you want to get a fever?
No?
Mr. Rayanam, please don't lose your cool.
Please sit down.
We need a group photo for the newspapers.
Let's take a group photo with Mr. Rayanam.
Sir, just one photo.
Come on, everyone. The meeting is over.
What's wrong with your dad?
Where will we go if he evicts us?
Unlike you, we don't have multiple houses.
Aasi, you appeared in my dream again
last night.
Maybe there is a scar...
What are you talking about?
Come here. Come.
-I'll make you feverish.
-Let me go.
I'm sorry.
Do you know how angry I am right now?
But I'm worried that if I get angry and
grow old, who is going to look after you?
Move closer.
Come close, Aasi.
If you don't have a house,
go and live in the ocean.
I can live with you
wherever you choose to.
Here comes the bus.
I can't hear a thing.
I am not going home.
-Did you just arrive?
-Yes, I just dropped by.
My dear niece,
why have you been complaining
about my son to your father?
You are going to get married to him,
sooner or later. Keep that in mind.
Come on! You can't rein in your husband,
but advise others.
Father, you may detest me for saying this.
But a girl's body and heart
will change with age.
It's better to rush these things up.
Where is my brother?
Kanakam.
-Kanakam!
-Sir?
Don't you serve tea
or coffee to the guests?
I will get them, sir.
I don't care if you keep stalling.
I do have the right
to ask for my niece's hand in marriage,
don't I?
You will always have the right to do so.
But your household is not worthy
to receive her.
Your husband ditched you
and went to live with a lower caste girl,
and washed his dirty linen in public.
It severed all ties between him
and this family.
If you can, tell me where your
husband is right now.
I can't bow my head in shame so easily.
Do you get it?
I will not forge an alliance with a family
that has lost its honor.
Brother, please...
We are siblings.
I can't deny that.
But I can't turn our bond
into an alliance with your family.
Have your tea and leave.
I will have tea at my house.
Damera Phanindra. You know him, don't you?
He's is the rural MLA.
This is his son's photo.
He is from our caste.
They will visit us shortly to see
my daughter.
Listen, son--
A warning to all the fishermen of Uppada.
According to our annual tradition,
if anyone takes their boats
to the ocean and engage in fishing,
between 15th April and 3rd June,
they will be fined heavily.
We saved a tenth of our earnings
in this collection box.
It's the time for the fishes to breed.
So, we can't go fishing for 45 days,
this will be the source of our livelihood.
We're distributing our savings equally
to all the 150 families here.
Spend it wisely.
-Here you go.
-Take it, Devudu.
Granny, you can take my money too.
May God bless you, dear.
Mom, I have been told that a suitor
is coming here to see me in two days.
I am not interested in marrying him.
Hey! Make it quick, guys.
Bring them on.
-Has everyone come back?
-Yes, Dad.
Put all the boats ashore. Mr. Rayanam
wants everything accounted for.
Aasi?
"Come to the college at 2 p.m. today."
No one saw this.
Let's go.
-Come on, get in.
-Drive.
Did everyone put away their boats ashore?
No matter who they are, don't show mercy.
Even if they are eating a meal,
drag them out of their houses.
By tomorrow morning, I should see
the board of Rayanam Fishing Yard there.
Okay, sir.
Buddy, keep going.
What happened, Bebamma? Tell me.
I am not feeling good.
Can we just go to the sea?
Now? To the sea?
No boat is going
to venture out into the ocean.
You can go on and love
however much you want.
This is the time when the fish
get intimate.
We can't disturb them.
Intimacy means getting together
and making love.
And you are doing the same.
You won't be bothering them.
Aasi, get back before nightfall.
All right.
I hope no one saw us.
What happened?
We've run out of gas.
What do we do now?
I am at work. I will talk to you later.
Sir.
The college bus should have been here
by now. Bebamma isn't back home yet.
What?
Hello?
This is Rayanam speaking.
Yes, Mr. Rayanam.
Why hasn't the bus come back yet?
Mr. Rayanam?
Bebamma has not yet returned home.
She told the lecturer
that she wasn't well
and left in the afternoon.
I am just checking
how vigilant you are.
She must have gone to the movies
with friends.
She will be home shortly.
-What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
Sir, no. Please...
No, please...
My God!
We toiled day and night
to build that house.
Now you are razing it to the ground.
This is unfair.
Why isn't he back yet?
How could you destroy our homes
for your fishing yard? Damn you!
We discussed this with Mr. Rayanam.
Look what he's done, Jalayya.
What's wrong with Bebamma?
She always wanders about the beach
and returns home covered in sand.
Why are your clothes wet, dear?
I went to the beach with my friends, Dad.
Mr. Rayanam,
no one should to go out
to the sea now.
A guy from your village just
took a boat into the sea.
There was a girl with him.
I am busy. I will talk to you later.
My God! Now, it's all ruined.
Sir, Mr. Rayanam is here.
Sir...
How could you destroy our houses
for your fishing yard?
Rayanam, this is unfair.
We discussed this, didn't we?
If you destroy our houses like this,
where are we supposed to go?
Our children
are going to be badly affected.
-Jalayya.
-Sir.
I need to speak with you.
Sir, please stop this.
Please ask them to stop razing our homes.
We will be ruined, sir.
Please stop this.
Something is fishy.
Ask them to stop, please.
Please have mercy on us.
-Jalayya.
-Sir?
No one is supposed to go out to sea
for the next 45 days, right?
Yes, sir. That is what we all agreed to.
But there was a boat that went
to sea today.
A boat? No.
Of course, yes. It did.
Let's assume that someone was desperate
to make a living.
He must come back by evening, right?
Then, why hasn't he come yet?
Sir, we are worried about lives,
why are you talking about the boats?
If it was just about of a boat,
I wouldn't have come this far.
My daughter was also on that boat.
Sir...
Did someone among you
take her out to sea?
Or did someone help the guy
who took her out?
No matter what the case is,
the news that my daughter wasn't home
has slipped out.
If my daughter isn't home by dawn,
the entire village would know about it.
-Jalayya.
-Sir.
If my daughter is home by dawn,
all of you can keep your houses forever.
Be careful.
For me, my honor and my life
are inseparable from one another.
They are the same.
Yes, sir. Yes.
They say that when a rich man dies,
he doesn't die alone.
And in this case,
it's my 18-year-old daughter.
And she won't go alone either.
Look,
it will lead to the death and suffering
of everyone in those 150 houses.
Take only those we can trust,
and bring her back. OK?
Aasi! Where the hell are you?
Uncle? Uncle?
Where is Aasi?
Bebamma...
What are you looking at?
You said that the fishes gather
to make love.
I'm just trying to see them.
Aren't you scared?
No one will come here
until the next new moon.
And we can't even go anywhere.
Then, let's enjoy this moment
and make it a night to remember
for the next 80 years.
-Govindu.
-Sir?
Do you think that the sky
and the ocean can ever meet?
No matter how tall the waves rise,
they can never reach the sky.
What if the sky bends?
What's the date today?
18th April, 2002.
Remember this day.
I, Kotagiri Sesharayanam,
could die in the year 2012,
or in the year 2022.
Whoever dragged my honor
and status into the sea,
he must die by my hand.
My daughter's attendance at the college
today must be confirmed by her lecturer.
If even one out of these two
doesn't happen,
mark this as the date of my death
on my grave.
If you die before that,
tell your son to do this one thing for me.
This has to happen.
Okay?
My daughter's attendance at the college
today must be confirmed by her lecturer.
Number one, Swathi.
Present, ma'am.
Number two, Sravani.
Present, ma'am.
Number three, Ramya.
Present, ma'am.
Number four, Priyanka.
Present, ma'am.
Number five, Sangeetha.
Number five, Kotagiri Sangeetha.
Number five, Kotagiri Sangeetha.
Kotagiri Sangeetha!
Present, ma'am.
We have made a big mistake, Bebamma.
Then, marry me, Aasi.
We can rectify this mistake.
Aasi!
Enough of this madness! Get on.
Sir, Bebamma is here.
Mr. Rayanam, there was nobody else
other than Bebamma.
Sir, you told me to take
only my trusted aides along.
There is my brother and my son
and this is my brother-in-law.
Sir.
We will always protect your honor
and the reputation of your family.
I promise you.
Now, Mr. Rayanam,
as you promised,
please give our houses back to us.
We will somehow eke out a living.
Let's go.
-Govindu.
-Sir?
Start the car.
Who the hell is he?
Rayanam, didn't I tell you
not to let a girl her age
step out of the house?
When you sent her out,
I knew she wouldn't
just focus on her education.
Who is it?
She will never say it.
We have to figure out who that dog is.
Don't lay a finger on her.
She went running into the arms
of a stray dog,
thinking that it loved her.
She should know how much
the people in this family love her.
-Kanakam.
-Yes, sir.
Take Bebamma inside
and serve her food, go.
-Govindu.
-Sir?
From tomorrow,
you must escort Bebamma to college.
-Okay.
-Why do you still send her out? Kill her!
She is not the one to be killed.
It is the guy she was with.
They are going to kill you.
Why didn't you tell me?
As your father, why would I oppose you
becoming the son-in-law of Rayanam?
But...
Why would Rayanam accept you
as his son-in-law, Aasi?
Aasi?
What is wrong with you?
Had Rayanam ventured out into the sea
you would have been caught and killed.
Take my advice and forget that girl.
If we returned the girl,
Rayanam promised to give our houses back.
If your love is more important
than the lives of 150 families,
do whatever you wish.
You listened to your father
and brought Bebamma back.
Rayanam unleashed his wrath on us
because his daughter went out with a guy.
If he finds out that it was you...
Aasi.
Come and have some food.
Aasi, what's wrong with you?
Were you here all night?
It will kill you.
Aasi...
SANGEETHA
-Govindu.
-Sir?
Keep an eye on all the young boys
in the village.
Yes, sir.
Make sure no one gets a whiff
of what we are looking for
and why we are looking for him.
Whose son are you?
I'm Gandham Subba Rao's son.
Why are there so many boys
near a women's college?
Why? Is there any problem?
Nothing. Just leave.
VISAKHAPATNAM
-Dad...
-It isn't safe for you to be here.
Go to Visakhapatnam
and stay there with your aunt.
Go on.
What brings you by here, Govindu?
Mr. Rayanam instructed us to get
all the boats painted.
-Are all the boys present in the village?
-Yes, they are. Where will they go?
Where is your son?
My son?
He...
He went for fishing.
Fishing is prohibited
until the next new moon day.
Sorry, I misspoke.
He must have gone down that road.
There he is.
All right, Jalayya. I have to go now.
Send your boy to paint the boats.
All right.
See you.
Oh, my God!
What was he doing near
a women's college? Thrash him.
Sir, why are you hitting me?
Mr. Rayanam, please...
Please stop this.
Why do you keep doing this?
Please stop it.
Kotagiri Sesharayanam
was my great grandfather.
I am named after him.
Whenever the British officials
came to our house to meet him,
they would leave their boots
outside the door.
That is the kind of reputation he enjoyed.
He bequeathed the same legacy
to my grandfather.
This legacy of honorable reputation
that began with my ancestors
has lived on for 125 years
and been passed to me.
That reputation is now being
ruined by my 18-year-old daughter.
And I am unable to uphold my legacy.
-Govindu.
-Sir?
Out of all these photos on this wall,
this one gives me immense joy right now.
That day when Jalayya
was handing over my daughter to me,
his son looked at my daughter
in a different way. Why?
Now I understand why.
Today is the new moon day, right?
Yes, sir.
-Govindu.
-Sir?
Do they still quarrel
with the neighboring village?
-Yes, they do.
-Sure?
-Yes, sir.
-Are you sure?
Yes, they do.
A warm welcome to everyone
who is attending this annual festival
in Uppada
hosted in honor of our
village deity, Gangalamma.
-How is your health, dear?
-I am fine, Uncle.
The festivities are in full swing.
How dare you!
How dare you touch me!
What the hell, girl!
Uncle, look. He is harassing me.
What are you doing?
Did you see me touching her?
The girl has complained to us.
The guys from your village are pathetic.
Don't you dare talk about my village.
-Dad!
-Uncle!
Hit him!
How dare you punch a guy from my village?
Stop it!
Stop it, please!
Aasi...
Hey...
No, stop it. Please stop it.
Aasi!
Aasi...
Aasi!
Let go of him.
-Dad!
-Aasi!
They killed Aasi's father, Bebamma.
A fight broke out between us
and the guys from the other village.
Aasi was badly hurt.
Where is Aasi now?
CHRISTIAN MEDICAL HOSPITAL
Where are you going?
Hop on.
-Brother?
-Yes.
What happened?
How come you are calling me up so late?
You left my house tearfully the other day
because of me.
Dad is really distressed by that.
Anyway...
How can I blame you and your son
for the follies of your husband?
Well, you said...
As you said, find an auspicious date
for the wedding and let me know.
My daughter will become
your daughter-in-law.
This is my promise.
Sure, Brother.
My daughter has lost her honor.
The only way to keep this a secret,
is to get her married within the family.
-Careful.
-Aasi.
Aasi...
Please read me a verse
from the Bible before you head out.
Hey!
-Sir?
-Sir?
Come...
Sir?
Bebamma is missing.
Search for her.
Bebamma...
-Hey!
-Sir?
-No one else should know.
-Yes, sir.
-Take the bicycles.
-Get the bicycles out.
Bring out the bicycle.
Bebamma?
Come, Aasi. Let's go away.
Where?
Somewhere far away from here.
Come on.
No, I won't.
They killed my dad right in front of me.
It is still very fresh in my memory.
I know this is not the appropriate
time to this.
But if we miss moment,
I will meet the same fate as your father.
-Please, let's go.
-Let go of me.
- Bebamma!
- Come with me, or I'll kill myself.
Please listen to me.
I need to tell you something.
Catch him!
Aasi! Aasi...
Aasi!
-Bebamma, let's go home.
-Let go of me.
Aasi! Aasi!
Aasi!
Come on.
Come on, guys.
Aasi!
Get on, Bebamma.
Get on.
Aasi...
Come, son.
Brother, why are you sitting here
at the entrance?
The priest said that my son must enter
your house before dawn.
And it'll be inauspicious later.
That's why my son and I are here.
The other relatives will soon follow.
-What happened?
-Sir, well...
Don't hesitate. Speak up.
Bebamma escaped on the cargo train
going to Odisha.
How dare you say that about the girl
who is getting engaged shortly?
-Govindu.
-Sir?
-Go and check on her.
-Okay, sir.
Sir, Bebamma is sleeping in her room.
I switched the fan on.
-Govindu.
-Sir?
From tomorrow onwards,
you must escort Bebamma to college.
All right.
She should continue buying her stationary
from Ninety Prakash's store.
Her clothes should be spic-and-span,
and well-ironed.
All right, sir.
And the attendance registers
at her college
should always record that she is present.
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.
As for as the engagement is concerned,
you can tell people
that planets are not aligned
or the scriptures do not ordain this,
or the girl is unable
to go through this now.
Use any excuse you will.
But at the appointed time
fixed by the priest,
my daughter will become
your daughter-in-law.
{\an8}What do you say?
{\an8}PURI
JAGANNATH CHARIOT PROCESSION
Aasi!
What happened?
I saw my dad's men.
{\an8}KOLKATA
MOTHER TERESA ORPHANAGE
Stop it.
I need to get to work.
-I'll pull down this towel.
-Do you have any sense?
I'm sorry, Bebamma.
I was angry and yelled at you.
Let go of me.
Please listen to me.
Bebamma.
I like you a lot.
Please let him go. I beg you.
Aasi! Aasi!
Aasi!
Aasi?
Dad...
Dad!
Sir...
Bebamma isn't in Kolkata either.
{\an8}GANGTOK
Sit down, Bebamma.
I'll get you something to eat.
All right.
Bebamma?
Bebamma?
Bebamma!
Bebamma!
Aasi!
How dare you touch Bebamma!
How dare you touch Bebamma!
She is my Bebamma.
How dare you touch Bebamma!
I will kill each one of you!
Rascals!
Aasi!
Where to?
It's not safe for you to be out.
You saw what happened last night.
Let's look for a ladies hostel.
-Hostel?
-It's 3,000 rupees per month.
Hundred rupees? Not possible.
-For one day.
-No. it's not possible.
-Just one day.
-Pay the entire amount or leave.
I beg you.
Aasi, please don't.
Please, ma'am. Please.
All right.
You have to pay up in two days.
Aasi. Where will you stay?
We need to pay 3,000 rupees.
I will be back.
Brother, it's been three months.
I just came here to remind you.
We have another three months left.
Go home.
You have to pay 3000 rupees per month.
Bro...
Thank you.
Take it.
Your money.
Aasi!
I paid the money for tomorrow as well.
How?
I've got a job.
They put me up in a room.
You got a place?
Then, I can stay with you. Let's go.
No, Bebamma.
I share that room with another guy.
Hello.
Okay, I'll go now.
If you toil day and night
like this, you will die.
What do you want?
I want 3,000 rupees.
Money.
-It's very nice.
-Eat.
I paid for the entire month.
You won't have any trouble.
Aasi, when you were paying
for my hostel on a daily basis,
I was hoping you will take me
away from here soon.
Now, I've to stay here an entire month.
What happened?
Ever since we arrived here,
we've been living apart.
Please understand the situation.
I need to take care of you.
How can I be with you all the time?
Earlier, even when you were not around,
I still felt close to you.
Now, I feel like we're drifting apart.
The love that's gotten us this far,
I no longer feel that in you.
So, what do you want me to do?
You came to me because
your family didn't love you.
If you don't find love in me,
why don't you go back home?
I cannot meet you like before.
I cannot sit with you and chat all day.
We can't just get married like that.
Life with me will be like this.
You can either stay or leave.
Take this money.
You can leave if you want.
Aasi...
Hey, bro...
She says that she can't feel my love.
DO NOT LITTER HERE
Are you crying over Aasi?
Why don't you eat something?
Eat a little, dear.
Hello.
Aasi!
Where were you all these days?
How could you abandon me
just because I made some comments?
No, Bebamma.
I had to go out of town
to make some extra money.
I want to stay with you wherever you go.
Let's go.
Please try to understand me.
I won't listen to you anymore on this.
Please listen to me.
I will not listen to you.
Bro.
-Greetings, sister.
-Greetings.
She will stay with us from now.
Welcome to our palace.
Please sit. Sit down.
Whom are you buying these for?
For her?
Can you give us some privacy tonight,
Ruben?
Sure. All right.
Why did you bring flowers today?
Come closer.
Let go of me.
Ruben might be back soon.
He won't come.
I told him not to come.
Aasi.
We can't do it for the next three days.
What happened?
Are you upset about it?
Don't worry.
You can still hug me.
You can still kiss me.
And you can love me
to your heart's content.
Can I?
Bebamma. Hot water.
Okay. I'll soon prepare your meals.
Why are you cutting your nails?
When you appear in my dream,
they might hurt you.
Bebamma!
Aasi!
It's a small injury. Nothing to worry.
Aasi.
-Does it hurt?
-No, Bebamma. It's a small wound.
-May I hold the baby once?
-Sure.
-Isn't he cute?
-Very cute.
Why don't you just marry me?
Your father will come back to us
as our baby.
We shall name that baby after my dad.
We will get married in two days.
We'll marry in the Puri temple,
just as you wished.
-Really? Tell me again.
-Let's get married.
-Tell me again.
-We will get married in two days.
Hello?
Mom, how are you?
I need to tell you something urgently.
Aasi and I are getting married.
I am very happy.
Our wedding is tomorrow.
Take care, Mom.
Bebamma, I will go and get the tickets.
Okay, go ahead.
Bebamma...
Aasi!
Bebamma!
Bebamma!
Bebamma!
The depression in the Bay of Bengal
will lead to heavy rainfall,
and gusty winds for the next three days.
The government has warned
the fishermen
not to venture out into the sea
for fishing.
Eat.
Eat it.
Bebamma. Eat it, dear.
Eat.
You're getting married in two days.
You must appear pretty to the guests.
Eat.
Look at your eyes. They are sunken.
Eat.
I left home when you wanted me
to get engaged.
What makes you think I will stay now?
I will run away
even if you get me married.
I want Aasi, Dad.
Why would I let you go?
I'm so fussy about my reputation.
I don't even like you traveling
with other villagers.
That's why I had arranged a special bus
to take you to college,
which is just 15 kilometers away.
Even though you eloped,
I made the entire village believe
that you were still here.
What makes you think I will keep quiet
if you just run away
and bring disrepute to me?
You will get married
to the boy of my choice.
You will spend your life with him.
And you will bear his children.
Is that clear?
I don't know if a daughter is supposed
to say this to her father.
But I am going to tell you, Dad.
The first time I eloped with Aasi,
I slept with him.
Did you know that?
I know that.
I searched for you all these days
and I couldn't find you.
Do you know how I found you
just two days before the wedding?
I couldn't have found you myself.
I found you because he ditched you.
Useless fellow!
He phoned and told us
your whereabouts, including
the platform number at the station.
Bebamma
will be on platform number 1,
at the Sivok Railway Station, Sikkim.
You can take her back with you
tomorrow morning.
It's a lie. This is a lie.
You are lying to me, Dad.
Did you really sleep with him?
If you can honestly tell me
that you slept with him
at least once in the past six months,
I'll let you go from here.
Try to remember.
How could you think I would leave
him alone after he ruined my honor?
Do you know what I did?
Aasi!
Let him go!
-Aasi!
-Dad!
Let him go! He will die.
Mr. Rayanam...
They are killing him.
Please save him.
They are killing him.
Dad!
Jalayya, both you and your son
have made a fool out of me.
Sir...
It was your son who took my daughter
to the sea.
And you cooked up a story
and said it was someone else.
Please forgive me, sir.
I made a mistake.
I did it to protect my son, sir.
Forgive us.
We'll leave this place for good.
He's bleeding from those injuries.
Let him bleed.
Once you see all that blood spill,
you and your son will finally understand.
When human blood is transfused,
unless it's from the same blood group,
the receiver would die.
Likewise, your son is not from my caste.
How could he fall in love with my daughter
and get away with his life?
You lower-caste bastard!
Please ask them to stop, sir!
Did your wife really sleep only with you
and gave birth to him?
Rayanam!
Watch your tongue!
Your daughter spent an entire night
with my lower-caste son.
What is your daughter's caste?
What the hell is your caste?
How dare you!
Jalayya, you were right.
Caste is not an obstacle for love.
Rayanam...
Rayanam, let him go.
I beg you.
Hey.
The only reason that my daughter fell
in love with you is because you are a man.
I'm not going to kill you.
No...
Please, no...
I'm going to cut off the manhood
that my daughter has fallen for.
Aasi!
Please let him go, sir.
I beg you.
No!
Aasi!
Hey.
You fell in love with my daughter,
yet I'm letting you live.
Because, unable to make love anymore,
you will live miserably.
If love is so great,
it belongs only
in graveyards and history books.
If it turns into love and begets a family,
it won't be great at all.
That's why love exists only in history.
It doesn't have a future in society.
What do you say?
Come with me, or I will kill myself.
Bebamma, I need to tell you something.
-I'm going to pull your towel.
-Hey!
I didn't get you here
to live with you, Bebamma.
I brought you here so that
you learn to survive without me.
I did put some distance between us,
but I was always guarding you.
I didn't know how to tell you.
I wanted you to know the truth
at least today.
That's why I did this, Bebamma.
Why don't you just marry me?
Your father will come back to us
as our baby.
I want you.
But I don't know how I can live with you.
If I made you stay with me,
would you call it love
or betrayal of your love?
I don't know.
But when you said you wanted to have kids,
I thought I was betraying your love.
That's why I'm sending you home, Bebamma.
Kanakam!
Get me some water.
-Govindu.
-Ma'am?
Can you do me a small favor?
-Sir...
-Go on.
What is it?
Can you take me to Aasi
wherever he is now?
Let go of my hand, Dad.
Let go of my hand.
-He has nothing to give you.
-Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand, Dad!
I am getting angry.
I am going to get old soon.
Actually, I should be angry with you.
Even though you put him through hell,
Aasi never told me the truth about you
and suffered in silence.
So, I'm angry with him too.
I am going to him,
and I'll grow old along with him.
I'm your daughter.
How could you even think that I went out
with Aasi just to sleep with him?
If I only went out to sleep with him,
I could've done that everyday
and got back home.
He loved me, Dad.
What happened?
He took me to the sea
because I asked him to.
Because he couldn't give me
what I asked for,
he let you bring me home.
That is all there is.
Nothing else.
How can you or Aasi judge
who is a man and who is not?
As a girl, I should judge that.
You are asking me if I was with him
for the past six months.
Yes, I was, Dad.
And in all those days,
I never felt that I was missing something
in my life.
Will any girl ever find a better man
than Aasi, Dad?
My teacher taught us something.
She said that manhood isn't something
that lies between thighs.
It exists in every nerve
and sinew of a man's body.
Maybe that's why when Aasi
holds my hand, I begin to sweat.
Dad, love means holding on
to your beloved,
not letting them go.
How would you know anything about love?
Ever since Mom got bedridden,
if only you had held her hand
lovingly just once,
you would have felt
the difficulty of letting go.
How can I make you understand, Dad?
Aasi doesn't have to lie on top of me.
It's enough if he just lies down
besides me.
If you really thought
that I went to just sleep with him...
I spent an entire night with him.
That experience suffices
for the rest of my life.
I am going to live with Aasi.
Bless me, Dad.
Sir...
Bebamma...
Sir... Bebamma...
Sir, she is leaving.
Stop her.
Govindu!
When his daughter was talking back,
not even once could he come up
with a response.
Then why are you stopping her?
Let her go.
Don't worry.
You can still hug me.
You can still kiss me.
And you can love me
to your heart's content.
Did you let me go because I wanted kids?
If I want kids,
I want them with you, Aasi.
Not with someone else.
No, Bebamma.
Dear God,
please protect us.
Grandpa.
God is missing a hand.
Can He still bless us and grant us wishes?
The idol might be damaged,
but nothing can damage God, my dear.
The divinity is inside.
The external damage to the idol
doesn't matter.
Love and divinity
never suffer from physical flaws.
Look.
See how I'm sweating
when you are beside me.
Even though Rayanam cut off
Aasi's manhood,
he couldn't stop Aasi from being a man.
A person's heart is like an ocean.
And the love that is born there
is like high tide.
The ocean may have boundaries,
but nothing can bound a rising tide.
That is why Bebamma crossed
all the boundaries and left with Aasi.
Isn't just one loving caress
enough for a lifetime?
