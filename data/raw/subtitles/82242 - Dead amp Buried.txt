That's areally good
camera, isn't it?
You gotta be a professional
photographer to have that camera.
Are you really?
Oh, that's exciting.
Yeah, sometimes.
-Pays well anyway.
-Are you here on... assignment?
No.
Just a vacation.
Are you famous?
I'm from St. Louis. Photographers
don't get famous in St. Louis.
Successful, maybe,
but not famous.
What's your name?
-My name is....
-No, no, wait. Let me guess.
You look like a...
Fred.
No, no, let's see.
-Freddie.
-Okay.
-I think you look like a Freddie.
-All right. Okay, okay.
I'll be Freddie, you can be... Lisa.
I've always wanted to meet a Lisa.
That's a really pretty name.
You see,
you're a very pretty lady.
Pretty enough to...
be a model?
Absolutely.
Now I want you to give me
a nice smile, Lisa, okay?
All right, here we go.
Come on, look at Freddie.
That's beautiful.
That's great. That's great.
You're so pretty.
Oh, you're wasting
your time here, Lisa.
You are so pretty. Come on,
come on, smile at Freddie.
-You like that?
-Great, that's wonderful!
I'm gonna put this in "Playboy".
Yes. Oh, that is nice,
Lisa. Beautiful.
Right in the camera.
Right in the camera.
Come on. Very nice. Very nice.
Have fun. Have fun.
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.
How's this, Freddie?
That's great.
Do I look good to you, Freddie?
You look wonderful to me.
Do you want me, Freddie?
Right here?
-Hey! What's happening?
-Smile, Freddie.
What are you doing to me?!
Welcome to Potters Bluff.
He's deader than hell.
Hello, Betty?
Come in, Betty!
Go ahead, Unit 1.
Betty, we're still waiting for
Dobbs to show with the meat wagon.
You did call the funeral home...
...didn't you?
-Ten-four, Unit 1.
I reached the funeral
home half an hour ago.
Mr. Dobbs said he'd come
out just as soon as he could.
You better try him again.
Tell him to hurry it up.
-Unit 1 clear?
-Yes, Betty, Unit 1clear.
Betty and her toys. Nobody else
to talk to on that police channel...
and she can't call me by my name.
TV cop shows, Harry. They do that.
You think the County'd let me
have this rig for salvage?
-Anyhow, she said he's on his way.
-Well, no hurry.
Fella's definitely a goner. Did you
get a gander at that face, Danny?
-Yes, Harry. I did.
-Pretty, huh?
Here comes Dobbs.
Talk about an entrance.
-Dobbs, where the h...?
-Just a minute.
-"And The Angels Sing". 1938.
-A little before my time, Dobbs.
Well, Dan, William G. Dobbs
is now at your service.
Let me get to work. Here.
...about 3O minutes, I'd imagine.
Well, Mr. Dobbs, as our
official coroner/mortician...
what'd you say
the cause of death was?
-Daniel.
-Morning. Midge, coffee, please.
-Sure, Dan.
-I was telling about that accident.
-Find out who that guy is yet?
-Not a thing. No ID...
...no license plates, nothing.
-Well, old buddy...
with the fancy salary the city
of Potters Bluff pays you...
and the amount of money the State
spent getting you educated...
...you should be able to find clues.
-lf you can't solve an accident...
...what'll you do if a crime happens?
-Very funny.
Now, boys, don't be riding Danny
here too hard. He's apt to leave us.
We're lucky to have him. He's got
a master's degree in criminology...
big cities fighting over him, and he
comes back to help the poor folks.
That's right. You people are very
lucky. Midge! How about that coffee?
-Coming right up, Dan.
-Hospital find out about this fella?
Give you any idea
when he might come to?
-They're not sure he will.
-My God! It's just awful!
Just terrible.
You got enough cream there, Dan?
All right. All right.
All right, then.
Stayin' outta your teeth.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me
anything about boats, my friend...
because I've spent my entire life
on boats. Big boats! All boats!
All I've got is a boat.
Too damn many boats.
That's enough of that.
Just remember who you're
talking to around here.
You know, dry on dry land...
you're all right.
Goodbye, old friend!
And keep away from boats!
You know, me, my friend,
I know about boats.
I've been about
boats all of my life.
I decide the discussion is
terminated as far as I'm concerned.
Boats.
Smile.
-Mr. Dobbs?
-What is it, Jimmy? I'm busy.
I know. Only it's Sheriff Gillis
and he says he needs to talk to you.
He says he needs to talk to me.
The truth is, he's in pursuit of an
immodest amount of that weed...
which you and your school chums
seem to find so fascinating...
and of which, it is rumored,
you are the town's leading merchant.
Now send him in.
And fear not. I'll never tell him
you keep it in the reposing room...
under a stiff.
Yes, sir.
-Good afternoon, Sheriff.
-Dobbs.
I hope you don't object to my
using you for light-hearted banter.
Don't think it was so light-hearted.
I did catch him with joints once.
Never let it be said I denied
employment to an ex-convict.
No big deal. He wasn't dealing. Just
a couple of joints. He's a good kid.
Dobbs.
Dobbs?
Forgive my preoccupation. She was
more difficult than I anticipated.
Why should she be any trouble?
She died in her sleep.
Poor Mrs. Collins. She looked as
though she'd been in a fistfight.
-So you put on a lot of makeup.
-A lot of makeup?
That would be appropriate for the
final viewing of a streetwalker.
The deceased was, I believe,
a retired music teacher.
-Congratulations.
-Oh, Officer. This is child's play.
I've replaced missing eyeballs with
sawdust and glued the lids together.
I've used bent aluminum
combs for dentures.
I've used the back part of the
scalp when there was no front part.
And I folded one hand over
wadded-up newspapers...
when the other hand had no fingers.
You find all this obscene, Sheriff?
Do you know what's really obscene?
Look at this. Look at the work
I've done. This is an art...
and I am the artist! What can you
remember about a sealed box?
A sealed casket: that is obscene.
That is the death of memory.
The cosmetologist gives birth.
I make souvenirs.
All right, Jimmy! Move it!
And now, Sheriff, precisely
what can I do for you?
I just wanted your professional
opinion about a hunch I got.
-A hunch?
-It keeps going around in my head.
From what you saw at
the crash site, is it possible...
the guy we fished
out of the wreck...
could've been placed in the car
to make it seem like an accident?
Frankly,
I have no real basis for...
Thank you.
-Dobbs Mortuary.
-Sheriff Gillis still there?
Just a moment, please.
It's for you, Sheriff.
-Yeah.
-Dan? Betty here.
-They found a body in the boatyard.
-What?
-You better get down there.
-Betty, I'll be right over.
Dobbs, meet me at the boatyard
as soon as possible.
Well, Dan, this is certainly
not an accident.
That's a murder. I bet I'm right
about the guy in the hospital too.
-Morning, Ben.
-Dan! How you doin'?
All right. Have you recently had
anybody check out without paying...
or... just disappear?
No.
Now, wait a minute.
A guy checked in here yesterday.
Said he'd be here a couple of days.
He hasn't checked out, and I
haven't seen him nor his car since.
But I noticed this morning
his suitcase is still here.
What's his name?
I don't bother much
with registrations anymore.
Well, we better check his things.
Oh, God. I hope nothing happened to
him while he was checked in here.
It's a jinx. This sort of thing
scares off your business.
Just kills the tourist trade.
I didn't know we
had a tourist trade.
Don't rub it in.
I'm telling you, it's tough
makin' it these days.
He's a photographer.
Lot of camera books. Not a damn
thing with his name on it.
-For Christ's sakes!
-What?
Ask your wife.
-My wife?
-She knows him.
My wife?
What are you talking about?
Well, I just remembered.
Remembered what?
The maid, Edna Jo. She says....
What did she say, Ben?
She says...
that your wife dropped
over yesterday to see him.
That's right.
Of course.
Thanks, Ben. I'll talk
to Janet about it tonight.
This is not important.
Hi, honey! A kiss.
-Uh-oh.
-What's "uh-oh"?
-Something's wrong.
-Nothing's wrong, Janet.
-You can talk to your wife.
-I'm just tired, that's all.
Come on. You know what you're like
when you keep it inside of you.
Who's the guy you went
to see at the hotel?
"Who's the guy you went
to see at the hotel?"
I was warned against marrying a cop.
You can't keep anything a secret.
What secret?
I was joking, you crazy cop.
There's no secret.
He's George... What's-his-name.
He sells photographic equipment.
What?
Did Ben tell you that I'd been
seen in a man's hotel room?
-Ben didn't mean anything by it.
-And why did he say it, then?
I think it's the guy we
found at the car wreck.
The one who was all burnt.
-ls he a friend of yours, Janet?
-Not really. It's...
it's just that it's the kind of thing
you think happens to other people.
Not to somebody you know.
George. George LeMoyne
was his name.
Excellent, at least we know his
name. Do you know where he's from?
No, honey, I don't.
I just saw him at school.
I feel a little shaky.
Can I get a hug, Danny?
It's all right. It's all right.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
-You know what's funny, though?
-No.
You were jealous.
A little bit.
Well, I guess I was.
-I love you, Dan.
-I love you, Janet.
-Mr. Haskell? Mr. Haskell?
-Why, hello, Dan.
-How are you, sir?
-Fine.
Maybe you could give me information
about the guy in the hospital...
...George LeMoyne.
-Yes.
He sold photographic equipment to
the school, but Janet couldn't...
What? What are you talking about?
-You did buy equipment from....
-No. Not only from him.
We didn't buy it at all.
Is it possible this is a transaction
you didn't know about, sir?
I know everything that's done
at the school. I am the principal.
-Yes, of course. Thank you.
-All right, Dan.
Mr. LeMoyne's signs are much
more stable today, doctor.
Good. Let me see the chart.
It's time for his
medication now, isn't it?
It is.
Well, I think I'll cut it down.
Just give him 5O cc's now.
-I'll be back within an hour.
-Yes, doctor.
-Doc?
-It's okay, Dan. Come on in.
They told me downstairs he pulled
out of coma. How's he doing?
It's touch and go.
We might pull him through, but...
even if we do, there's not much
the best plastic surgeon can do.
You saw him. His entire
face is one charred mass.
-And the right eye, I'm afraid....
-Any chance I could talk to him?
-Even....
-Briefly. Just for a moment.
Let's go outside.
Come on, let's sit down.
Well, when'll I be
able to talk to him?
Look, Doc, I've got to find out
what the hell really happened!
Sit down, Danny, sit down.
I'm sorry, Doc. This...
this thing got me spooked.
-Look, has he said anything at all?
-No. Not a thing.
And I'll tell you, I'm afraid he's
gonna be difficult to understand.
-Understand?
-Well, you see...
he has no lips.
Hello, Freddie.
Hi. I'm so glad to see
that you're feeling better.
You had a very close call,
but you're gonna be all right.
Now just lie still.
I'm gonna give you something. It's
gonna make you feel even better.
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel. You're
a great disappointment to me.
A whole week. You're still unable
to establish that man's identity.
-What's it to you, Dobbs?
-What's it to me? A sealed casket.
That's what you have me
burying there. A sealed casket.
If you had been able to find
that poor boy's family...
they might've asked me
to perform some of my magic.
You know, Dobbs,
sometimes you make me sick.
Sick? You bring me a body
that smells like burnt steak...
you force me to keep it till it rots,
and you have the nerve to tell me...
...that I make you sick?!
-Two murders, Dobbs!
Both strangers. Two murders in a
town no bigger than a postage stamp.
Now you leave me the hell alone.
Dan? Honey, I'm home!
-Where have you been?
-Honey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had a million errands. Paul
Haskell had another staff meeting.
And tonight is PTA.
Wanna come?
I know how much you enjoy it. Think
how much fun you'll have with me.
-I'd rather not.
-Okay. But if you want dinner...
you have a choice of fish
sticks or beef stroganoff...
and both come out of the package,
but I'll pre-heat the oven for you.
Honey?
Dan? What happened?
You look so down.
It's nothing. Janet, l....
It's nothing. It's just
those murders, you know?
My God, yeah, the murders.
That's horrible.
Listen, honey, I've gotta go.
Look what I forgot.
Would you please drop
this off at Ernie's for me?
-Why? What is it?
-It's some film my students shot.
It's their new class project, a good
way to teach them about narrative.
Hey. You don't mind, do you?
No, no, it's all right.
Honey...
you'll catch the murderer.
I know you will.
-Okay. Listen, I'll be back early.
-Okay.
I'll go inside and ask
for directions.
-Be right back.
-All right.
Ron?
-What?
-Don't forget to ask about the gas.
Right.
-Excuse me.
-Good evening. Can we help you?
-I hope so. I'm lost.
-You're in Potters Bluff.
-Where did you wanna be?
-The Sea view Lodge.
No, you're not lost. Just take
the Highway 12 over there.
Thanks.
My, what a cute little boy.
-Jamie has to go to the bathroom.
-Come on, I'll show you where it is.
You want your Mommy and
Daddy to take you, right?
-Well, what is it that you want?
-Ice cream.
I'm sorry, we just
don't happen to have any.
That's all right. We'll get you
some ice cream later, okay, pal?
-Let's go.
-Ron, gas.
-Is there a gas station nearby?
-Freddie.
-Can you sell these folks some gas?
-Sure thing. It's down the street.
-Didn't mean to disturb your dinner.
-No problem. Happy to help you out.
-And thank you.
-You folks must be from the city.
-Not used to all this hospitality.
-Yeah, that's right.
-I can't see a thing in this stuff.
-Neither can l.
-You want some gum?
-Jesus!
-Why did you swerve like that?
-Somebody ran in front of the car.
Jamie, are you all right?
Here, son. Come on up with
Mommy and Daddy. That's a boy.
-There you are.
-Honey, are you all right?
-Let me see that.
-He hurt his head.
-Let me see, son.
-Look, there's a light.
-Where? I don't see any light.
-I saw a light, Ronny! I just....
-There's no light up there.
-I saw a light!
You're being silly. There's no
light there. I don't see any light.
All right, I didn't see
anybody run across the road.
Okay, honey. We'll have a look.
-Don't cry, you'll be fine.
-Come on, fella. There we go.
Maybe they have some ice to make
a cold compress or something.
-All right.
-Or we can use the telephone.
-Sure.
-Jamie, are you all right, honey?
Boys bump their heads
all the time. Right, son?
-His head hurts.
-Honey, maybe you're right.
-This place looks abandoned.
-Go ahead, knock.
Let's go back to the car.
Hello? Listen, we just had an
accident out in the street and...
if we could get some help....
-Anyone in there?
-No.
-The lights don't work.
-Maybe they're upstairs.
We need some help. Hello?
-There's nobody here!
-Is anybody here? I saw a light!
Try in there, then,
for Christ's sake.
Is there anyone here?
Hello? Hello?
We have a son who's injured, and if
you could help us or something....
No! I saw a light in this house.
Let's get ice or a compress.
Baby, come on, look at this place.
It's been abandoned for years.
-Let's go!
-I saw a light! I know I did!
-You thought you saw it.
-I didn't imagine it, Ron. I saw it!
-I wanna get out.
-I'm telling you I saw....
-Jamie, you okay?
-Didn't mean to scare you.
It's all right. Now let's
get outta here, all right?
-It's the house.
-There is somebody here. No.
It's the house, let's go! There's
nobody here, let's get outta here!
-I don't like it. It's not safe!
-They're fixing the fuses!
Fine, okay, fine.
Go with your mom, all right?
I'll find it, wherever that is, and
show you there's nobody here. Stay.
-Okay, okay.
-Christ!
-Hurry up, okay?
-All right!
Anybody here?
Ron?
Ronnie?
Ronnie?
God!
Okay, come on, let's...
let's look inside the refrigerator.
Let's see what's in here.
Here we go.
-Where's... Dad?
-Come on, sweetie.
There's not any ice
in here for your head.
-What's the matter?
-You scared me, honey.
There's nobody in the basement.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Welcome to Potters Bluff.
-What's going on here?
-Give me the boy! Run!
-Ronnie!
-Come on, run!
-Get in!
-Where?!
Mommy! Mommy!
Jesus Christ,
how many are there in here?!
God! Take Jamie! Hurry up!
In here!
Leave us alone!
-Honey, no, I can't!
-There's a balcony here, let's go!
You can make it!
Get out there! Here!
I'll carry Jamie. Honey, get going!
Hold on!
Honey, hurry up!
-Help me, help me!
-Come on!
Hang on!
Get in the car!
-Hurry!
-Give me here Jamie!
They're coming! They're coming!
Start the car!
They're coming! They're coming!
Start the car!
-Get out!
-Lock the door, lock the door!
-All right, get up there!
-My God, honey! Start the car!
Lock the door!
I got it!
They were trying
to kill us, Ronnie!
Get off! Get off!
Get off!
Jesus!
Oh my God.
Stop!
-Janet?
-Yeah, honey?
-I had some shells here. Seen them?
-Shells? When were you at the beach?
Bullets, Janet, bullets.
"An ancient folklore has they can
only be made from persons dying...
violent deaths."
Janet!
What the hell are
you doing with these?
It's for my class. I'm gonna
give a lecture on witchcraft.
Witchcraft? And why in God's name
would you wanna teach them that?
Kids love creepy things.
Keeps them from
being bored in my class.
So you picked witchcraft.
I just thought of it.
I don't know why I'm defending
myself. You grill me like a suspect.
Sorry, Janet. I've just
been under a lot of pressure.
Speaking of the kids, Dan, did you
drop the film off at Ernie's?
-I forgot.
-Those kids worked hard on that!
I'll take care of it, Janet.
By the way, I found your bullets.
They were in the cabinet...
where you left them.
-Have a good day, ladies.
-Morning, Ernie.
-Dan.
-I want this film developed ASAP.
-Police business. When'll I have it?
-On Wednesday.
-It oughta be back by then, I hope.
-Okay. Ernie...
nobody picks this up
but me, understand?
Okay.
Nobody.
Yeah, yeah, the fisherman's
on the County too, Dobbs.
-Poor man was just passing through.
-Say, Dan...
you think you could get the County
to pay me to reconstruct his face?
Don't get greedy, Dobbs. Just
seal him in a box and bury him!
-What about that hunch I had?
-After careful consideration...
I've come to the conclusion
you may be right.
It's very possible he was
disfigured somewhere else...
and then placed in the wrecked car
to make it look like an accident.
-Why not do that with the fisherman?
-I'm not the detective.
You are.
And keep up the
good work. Bye, bye.
"Good work".
-Danny? Harry here.
-Yeah, Harry?
I just pulled a late model Ford out
of the water down by South Beach.
-Appears she come off the bluff.
-Off the...? Oh, no.
-Was there anybody in it?
-No. Just a kid's toy airplane.
I have to find out if any of these
particles contain human skin.
I scraped it off a car that might've
been involved in a hit-and-run.
Hit-and-run?
Sure, Dan,
I'll give the full workup.
-Can you get it over to me soon?
-Dan?! Dan!
-Come on in, Ben.
-Okay. See you later, then.
Yeah, Doc. I'll drop it off some
time this afternoon. Thank you.
-Sit down, Ben. What's wrong?
-That guy.
The one you came
to see me about last week...
...that died after the car wreck.
-Yeah?
I just saw him.
-Ben, what are you talking about?
-He's at the station, pumping gas!
-Ben, he's dead!
-You go over there and take a look!
I never got a look at him. Obviously
it's a guy who looks just like him.
-It's the same guy!
-Ben, would you just...?
-I was standing next to that man....
-Calm down.
You ask your wife!
So, voodoo...
is basically religion.
Belief and conversion are absolutely
necessary for its practices to work.
-Hi, Sheriff Gillis.
-Good afternoon, girls.
But, despite what you might
have seen on the late show...
when you were watching what
your parents told you not to...
they do not...
walk around...
Like this.
-Yes.
-You sure?
You scared us.
No!
You okay?
Although they are
conventionally dead...
they're capable of very
closely imitating the living.
There are even reports, not
substantiated but not discredited...
of a tribe in central Peru...
whose residents included a great
number of these... walking dead...
who were completely
at the will of their master...
and they roamed around
the mountains killing strangers...
and bringing them back
to their master. Now...
you wanna hear
the really creepy part?
-Yeah.
-Okay.
In order for the master to retain
control over his undead...
he had to cut out their heart...
and keep it...
hidden.
Janet, how come Haskell didn't know
about LeMoyne and the equipment?
Oh, so you're the big mouth!
The PTA was buying it as a surprise.
-I'm sorry.
-Well, you didn't know.
We don't need gas. I just
filled it up this morning.
I realize that.
If I told you once....
This is a piece of machinery that
takes a lot more than gas to run it.
-You gotta check the oil, water....
-I'm not a mechanic, I'm a teacher.
-What can I do you for, Sheriff?
-Freddie, would you check the hood?
Sure thing.
Listen, I'll check the oil, I'll check
the water. Just give me a kiss.
Hey! You sure you
wanna ride with me?
How do you know
I'm not a dirty old man?
They call me Chance.
How far are you goin'?
I'm goin' to Potters Bluff, but I have
to stop at my place up the road.
Hey, you wanna come on up
with me to Potters Bluff?
It's a real nice little town.
You ever been up there?
-Never heard of it before.
-Come on in outta the rain, honey.
There we go.
All right!
We won't get home until dawn.
-Now, where are you heading?
-No place in particular.
Well, then I'd think about staying
a spell up there in Potters Bluff.
You know, I'd damn sure rather live
in a nice little town like that...
than in some big city full of
killers and muggers, you know?
-Yeah.
-Well, there's my boat right there!
-You live on a boat?
-Hell, all my life.
Okay now, I'll just be a second,
honey. I'm gonna pick somethin' up.
Excuse me, I wanna get something
right out of this glove box here.
Smile.
What are you doing?!
Smile.
No, please!
So lovely.
So frail. So young.
How could anyone
mar such loveliness?
My dear...
I will make you beautiful again.
Even more beautiful than before.
Another masterpiece,
complete and beautiful.
Now you can sleep peacefully.
You couldn't've mixed that
with another piece of evidence?
-No way.
-Well, I checked it three times...
and it keeps coming out the same.
-That's impossible.
-Look, if you don't believe me...
send it upstate somewhere,
but I'm telling you...
that these bits of flesh have been
dead at least three or four months!
Why? When did you think
this hit-and-run happen?
-lt wasn't recent.
-Are you absolutely sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Oh, you're wrong, Doc,
I know you're wrong.
It can't be.
It can't be!
-Potters Bluff Sheriff's Office.
-Betty?
-Hi, Doc! How are you?
-Is Dan there?
-No, it's too early for him.
-Where is he? I gotta speak to him.
I don't know, but I can try and
find him for you. I just know....
No, no, never mind.
I'll go find him myself.
Damn you, what're you doing?
What's going on?
Jill, what are you doing? That's
acid! Don't do that! You're insane!
Stop that! No! No, no,
let go! Don't do it!
What are you doing here, Dobbs?
-Dobbs, what are you doing here?
-Morning, Daniel.
-Dobbs, I don't have time....
-Don't get pushy and policeman-like.
-This is very embarrassing for me.
-What is?
Well... I'm here
to report a theft.
-What, somebody steal a body?
-Yes.
-What?
-That pretty young waif you found.
-You mean somebody dug up her grave?
-Well, this morning...
I would've laid her to rest,
but she was gone.
What the hell is going on
in this town?!
What maniac is loose out there?
First murders, now body snatching!
My God, I can't believe it! Okay,
come on, we'll go to your office.
No! We can't do that.
Why can't we?
We can't let anybody know.
My reputation.
Who would entrust a loved one to a
mortician known to have lost a body?
Would you, Dan?
-This is ridiculous.
-Well, maybe I am panicking.
Maybe my young protegé slipped her
into a drawer and forgot to tell me.
-I'll check. I'll talk to you later.
-I hope you find her.
With three murders and my wife,
I've got enough problems of my own.
-Yeah. Janet's been acting strange.
-You hardly know her.
She comes to visit me all the time.
Didn't you know that?
You wouldn't have anything
to do with her sudden interest...
in witchcraft and
voodooism, would you?
Certainly not. And you can tell her
I was more than mildly insulted.
Just because I'm a mortician,
she had the audacity to insinuate...
that I might have knowledge
of the black arts.
Dobbs, you don't believe
the dead can come back, do you?
Back to life?
In my profession, that's a rather
unpleasant thing to think about.
Come on. You're not gonna tell me
you believe that missing corpse...
just got up and walked away!
I don't know what
to believe anymore.
Just a minute.
-Hello.
-Hi, Dan. I' m late.
Yes, Betty. I did notice
you were late again.
-My car wouldn't start, lwaited....
-Okay, okay.
-I have to leave. Talk to you later.
-Betty, just... as soon as you can.
On your way over, stop at Ernie's
and see if that film's ready.
-Dan, did you look at that telex?
-What telex?
-From St. Louis.
-St. Louis?
-It's about George LeMoyne.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-It's on your desk, Dan.
-It's on my desk.
"Close to positive ID on your
so-called George LeMoyne.
Facilities here better equipped.
Request body be transported."
Dobbs?
Jimmy, what the hell
are you doing?
Nothing. I gotta go now.
Dobbs!
Sam?
Sam!
Where's Dobbs?
I ain't seen him yet today.
Get your shovel, Sam,
we're gonna have to dig him up.
Dig up? I don't dig them up.
I just bury them.
-This one you're gonna dig up.
-Not without Mr. Dobbs' permission.
You don't need his permission. I'll
take responsibility. Get started!
Dobbs?
-Come on, Sam, I'll help you.
-I don't need no help.
Come on, I'll help you with it!
I gotta get this damn box open!
-Come on, now, open it!
-Are you crazy?
I don't wanna see
no rotting corpse.
This box doesn't weigh enough
to have a corpse in it. Now open it!
No. Mr. Dobbs sealed it.
Betty. Betty, get on the telex.
Come on, come on!
Okay, Dan.
Records Division, Police Department,
Providence, Rhode Island.
"Request immediate
check on arrest records...
and/or convictions of
one G. William Dobbs...
male, approximately
7O years of age, 6 feet...
weight... 14O pounds.
Present occupation:
funeral home owner.
Resident here since
approximately spring 197O.
Uh, Betty. Betty?
When you finish, send this
photo to the police in St. Louis.
I wanna know if he's
their missing person.
-Anything else, boss?
-Yeah. Send the telex.
Wait a minute!
Ernie said the film was ready.
Thank you, Betty.
-Have you got that roll of film?
-Yeah. I got it right here.
That'll be 5 dollars and 40 cents.
Things keep goin' up.
Sorry it took so long.
-Sorry.
-Not another hit-and-run, I hope.
-You okay?
-But are you?
To tell you the truth,
I'm not so sure.
Police work's a high-stress
occupation. Watch yourself.
-Doc, can I talk to you, please?
-I can't talk long.
-Just a minute. It's important.
-All right, Dan. What is it?
In your professional opinion...
is there any way whatsoever to
reanimate people after they die?
And to...
to get them to walk around?
-You have been working too hard.
-I'm not joking.
My God, you're serious.
You remember what you said after
examining that particle of skin...
...from the supposed hit-and-run?
-Sure. I said it'd been dead months.
It wasn't months. It was my car, my
accident. Happened the night before.
-Couldn't be.
-I'm telling you it was.
Listen, maybe Norman was giving
you a tune-up three months ago...
and he scraped
his arm on your grill!
Doc, corpses have been
disappearing from their graves.
Well, if that's true,
that's very distasteful...
but they have not been restored
to life. That's for sure.
Dan! Dan, the telex
from Rhode Island!
-Where is it?
-Hold it. We're standing by.

My goodness.
Our Mr. Dobbs?
Where are you going?
Janet?
Janet!
Janet, you home? Janet!
Dobbs!
What did you do to her? Goddamit,
what did you do to my wife?!
-Good evening, Constable.
-What did you do to my wife?
Janet. My crown jewel.
My very first. My seedling.
Where is she?!
Look at them, Daniel.
Look at my children!
-Oh my God.
-They had to be disfigured.
Don't you see? I have to make them
look like they were. That's my art.
Where is my wife?
Janet, I found her in Harris Creek,
in her car. She had drowned.
You're crazy.
You're totally insane!
Not even her injuries or her bloated
condition could hide her beauty.
-My God, she can't be dead.
-Yes, she was. She is.
Like all the others, like that
man you ran over with your car.
He was dead long
before you hit him.
-How did you do it?
-Call it black magic.
Call it a medical breakthrough.
I'll take my secret to the grave.
Oh my God....
It's a nightmare! No!
I've always liked you, Daniel,
so I gave her to you as a gift.
Most of the others, I gave back
a little of their lives, but Janet...
I gave her fear and sex and love.
The others'd fall apart in a week if
I didn't touch them up, but Janet...
Janet could go
three weeks, a month!
The others... drawings. Janet...
Janet was a painting.
My masterpiece.
Why are you doing all this?
Because when people are dead they
don't get sick, they don't age...
and after I work on them,
they look so good, so healthy...
I can't bear to bury them! They're
even more beautiful than the living!
You evil son of a bitch!
You will try to kill me,
Dan, but you can't.
You can only make me dead.
Go on, pull the trigger!
Help me become
one of my own children!
Oh, Daniel. I enjoy these
little chess games with you.
Perhaps you need
a little more motivation.
Hello, baby. How was your day?
You wouldn't believe mine.
Paul Haskell had another locker
check ten minutes before lunch.
-Janet!
-...everybody standing in the hall...
next to their lockers.
It was enough to drive me crazy.
-What would you like for dinner?
-I'll get you for what you've done.
The dead have no memory
except what I give them.
She only appears alive.
-You are alive.
-She's dead, Dan.
She's dead.
You can have anything for dinner,
if you don't mind fixing it yourself.
-But I'll fix it for you.
-She's dead.
...between minute steak...
-Baby, please, die, die!
She's dead.
-Also, you have pork chops...
-Die!
...or beef stroganoff, but I warn...
-Please!
...it's out of the package.
Dan, I'm dead.
Please bury me.
Please.
Dan... bury me!
Janet!
Janet!
Janet!
Bury me.
Please.
Please, Dan!
I love you, Dan.
May she rest in peace, Dan.
Ernie?
Betty.
Ben.
Dan, old buddy.
If you can't solve an accident,
what'll you do if a crime happens?
Harry.
Freddie.
What can I do you for, Sheriff?
Midge!
Midge?
Jimmy.
I gotta go.
Police work's
a high-stress occupation.
Doc?
...restored to life.
That's for sure.
-Be happy for her, Dan.
-Smile.
No!
Don't touch me! Get back!
Keep away from me!
God, no, please!
No! Don't touch me! No!
Don't let him get away!
There's one more thing
you should know, Dan.
Come, Dan.
Let me fix those for you.
