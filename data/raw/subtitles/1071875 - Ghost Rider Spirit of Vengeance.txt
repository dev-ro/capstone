Benedict.
Is this true?
You have found the boy?
Yes.
He's not safe here.
Nonsense, this is a fortress.
The full resources of the Order
are at our disposal.
Respectfully,
Benedict, the devil himself
wants this child.
Only one place is safe.
That is the Sanctuary.
The Rider must take him.
You do enjoy your wine, Moreau.
In a few days,
the winter solstice will be past
and with it the hour of the prophecy.
Then the boy will be
of no use to anyone.
By that time.
Brother,
you will all be dead.

JOHNNY:
It doesn't matter how far you run.
There are some demons
you just can't escape.
My name is Johnny Blaze.
I rode a motorcycle for a living.
I did a bare-ass, 360,
triple backﬂip
in front of 22,000 people.
(JOHNNY CHUCKLES)
It's kind of funny.
It's on YouTube. Check it out.
But when my dad got sick,
I did something
way crazier than that.
ROARKE: You look like you
could use a little help.
Are you willing to make a deal,
John?
Attaboy.
JOHNNY:
Do it.
Save his life.
Do it!
Yeah, that is right. I'm the guy
who made the deal with the devil.
I know what you're thinking.
Doesn't this kid watch movies?
Does this ever work out fine?
Let's just say good judgment
was not exactly my forte.
I was possessed by
an ancient demon.
In the presence of evil,
I change into a monster,
and I pray
on the wicked,
and I suck out their souls.
And you don't wanna be around
when that happens.
See, there's good and bad
in all of us.
And maybe you're not a murderer,
but you did something
you wouldn't want the Rider to see.
A white lie, an illegal download.
What about you? And you?
I've tried to fight it, to hold it back,
but the darkness inside me
only gets stronger.
That's why I had to run
halfway across the world.

The Rider.

You thought that you could control it.
Make it work for you, huh?
That you were stronger
than this deep, hungry thing?
This
sickness.
(GRUNTS)
Why are you here?
Aah!
What do you
want from me?
I need your help
and you need your soul.
So we make a deal.
You know about making deals,
don't you, Johnny? Huh?
Nice bike.
This child.
He is in danger
and for more than his life.
You will save him.
I don't
save people.
(MOREAU CHUCKLING)
MOREAU: What brought you
out here, Johnny Blaze?
Thousands of miles
from your place of birth
and your dark rebirth.
You were brought here for this.
This little kid,
what makes you think I can find him?
This man that you met years ago
that put the curse
On you?
Roarke.
The devil has many names.
He is the link that connects you
to this child.
Let the Rider follow his stench.
It will lead you to the boy.
You said something
about a deal.
The church of my masters
is an ancient one.
We are prepared to give to you the one
thing you want the most of this world.
Bring us the boy,
and we will lift your curse.

Changing the defined terms of an

You told me to get a kid.
Not a problem.
I've done that
for people before.
And I have history

The kid, Danny.
He's your son?
Bullets can't hurt you
when you walk with the demon.
But they'll do
what they're supposed to
right now.
Tell me why I can trust you.
You can't.
But if I don't find your son,
I'd just as soon be dead.
So if you
wanna pull
that trigger...
do it.
Please.
You tracked us last night.
Can you do it again?
I could feel him before.
I could sense him and then nothing.
No, no, he's not dead,
he's just blocked.
But you know something.
Let's go.
JOHNNY: Yeah, okay, well, let
me just get something straight.
The guy who kidnapped Danny
and tried to kill you and blew me up
with grenades,
you two were like
boyfriend, girlfriend?
Carrigan was a gunrunner,
a drug dealer, a mercenary.
I didn't care about that.
I just saw a ticket out.
Right, okay, and so Danny is...?
Danny, what, is Carrigan's son?
No.
Um...
When you met the seducer,
he offered you something.
Yeah. My father's life.
Shocker, he lied.
For me, it was only myself.
It was supposed to be big
for Carrigan, but it went bad.
I made it out a third-floor window.
I was choking on my own blood.
(COUGHING)
I knew I was gonna die.
I could feel it.
And that's when he found me.
ROARKE: You look like you
could use a little help.
Roarke.
He promised to take
the pain away,
to save my life.
But he asked
for something in return.
A son?
Maybe you can never understand.
No, I get it.
You're the devil's baby mama.
I guess that explains
why Moreau
wants
Danny so bad.
Moreau?
Yeah.
Black, French, alcoholic priest,
a dick. Know him?
He tried to help us.
I didn't let him.
Well, we're both gonna work
on our decision-making.
Where you headed?
Someone I know.
He does Carrigan's dirty work.
He'll know where to find him.
JOHNNY: Why does the devil walk
on earth in human form anyway?
I have no idea.
Maybe he doesn't know either.
Maybe he just
passes on from body to body,
through history,
waiting for the perfect fit
But I know one thing:
On Earth, he's weak.
His powers are limited.
He needs emissaries
to do his dirty work,
so he finds them or makes them
using his greatest power:
The power of
the deal.

Before they could kill him.
JOHNNY:
There's no sign of him.
Whoever did this wanted
him alive.
I think we all
have a pretty good idea
who that would be, Moreau.
NADYA:
Yeah. So now he's
with Roarke. Some protectors
you turned out to be.
What exactly does Roarke
have in mind for Danny?
What are his plans for his son? Is he
putting money away for college? What?
MOREAU:
It is the day
of prophecy
As was the day Danny
was conceived.
The child must be
in his 13th year
before the rite can be performed
on the dawn of winter.
The rite.
Roarke fathered the boy as a vessel,
as a container for his power.
The ritual will transform
his essence,
his soul into the boy.
There will be no more Danny.
Only Roarke.
No!
Why the hell didn't you tell us this?
Hey.
You made a deal with Roarke!
Both of you!
Something I would never do.
The prophecy had to happen
at the dawn of a new day.
Maybe there's still time.
Do you know where Roarke has him?
I think so.
What, so now you want
to play hero?
You got what you wanted.
Yes, I did.
Thank you for holding up
your end of the bargain.
You're welcome.
JOHNNY:
If I can spend my last day
as a free man without a curse
over my head, I'll take it.
But I promised Danny
he'd be safe.
And if I walk away now,
I'm just trading
one demon for another.
So let's go.
(CHUCKLES)
Was there ever any doubt?
Don't
touch me.
Cutting it a bit close,
aren't we?
CARRIGAN:
You have any idea
what I had to go through
to get this little turd?
(DANNY GRUNTING)
Look,
the planets don't align for your
pagan party until daybreak tomorrow.
So get off my ass because
I'd say I'm ahead of schedule.
Danny.
Do you know who I am?
Well, I'm sure
your mother told you
a lot of things about me.
What's the matter
with your face?
(CHUCKLES)
MOREAU: Uzak Gökten.
The farthest point from heaven.
That is where the ritual is to take place,
according to the prophecy, of course.
Of course.
Without the Rider, we stand
very little chance against Roarke.
You were
supposed to have faith.
I do.
But also, I think
we should have weapons.
JOHNNY:
Guns
and wine.
Naughty priests.
I'm starting to like you again,
Moreau.
(CHUCKLES)
You wanted to know
why I look this way.
Think of
a flamethrower.
(LAUGHS)
Is that funny?
Okay.
A flamethrower
made out of papier-mâché.
All that
power.
But try to use it, you burn up.
This body I'm living in,
it's weak, human.
It's dying.
It was never made to do
the things that I can do.
But you,
you're only part human.
You have all the power
that I have inside of you.
Like father, like son.
But this
corporeal
form
can wield the power
without burning itself up.
To help you
relax.
(GRUNTING)
That will keep him sedated
until the ceremony.
Who are they?
MOREAU: Politicians, murderers,
people of influence.
The devil's soldiers.
They've traveled
from all over the world
to witness the anointing
of the new king.
JOHNNY:
Oh. The new king.
(SCOFFS)
Please.
MOREAU:
If Roarke succeeds,
he'll have a new form, one more
powerful than he's ever known.
And a shadow will
fall upon the earth.
(ALL CHANTING
IN DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
NADYA:
Twenty-five,
30 men. More inside.
The ritual has already begun.
Danny's soul
will be lost forever
at the break of dawn. This is
when Roarke is at his weakest.
Nadya?
(SIGHS)
You all right?
I've made a lot
of mistakes, Blaze.
But Danny...
Danny's the one...
The one good thing
I ever did.
Well, ahem,
that being the case,
we had better make sure he doesn't
turn out to be the Antichrist.
(ALL CHANTING
IN DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)
Okay. Not much time.
What's the plan?
Plan is you go, you grab the boy,
you run and you don't stop.
What about you?
Me? I'm going through the front.
Okay. Ha, ha.
Not bad.
This might be good on a salad.
Johnny Blaze!
(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)
Go.
(SHOUTS IN FRENCH)
Ahh.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Catch this one, huh?
What a waste of good wine!
(GRUNTS)
(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)
(GROUP CHANTING IN

(SPEAKING IN

(SPEAKING IN
DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
(ALL YELLING)
(SHOUTING IN LATIN)
That felt good.
(SHOUTING IN LATIN)
Come on.
(GRUNTING)
Danny, listen to me.
I shouldn't have gotten rid
of the power.
I know that now.
He's gonna erase you, Danny.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
(CHUCKLES)
Moreau.
I can still see the light!
Oh.
Ugh. That's gross.
ROARKE:
You have no power, Blaze.
You're nothing but an insect
like the rest.
Food for the mills
Of hell.
No.
Not yet.
Oh, you wanna watch?
The apple doesn't rot
far from the tree! Heh, heh.
Danny.
(PANTING)
This is not who you are.
It never
will be.
My powers and yours are the same.
That's what you said.
Right?
Dad?
Like father, like son.
Do it.
No!
Whoa.
MAN:
Whoa!

Come here.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
CARRIGAN:
Enough!
I was never afraid of you.
(ROARING)
Roadkill.
(GROANING)
(ROARING)
You!
Worst fucking deal I ever made.
(LAUGHING)
(SCREAMING)
GHOST RIDER:
Go home.
(SNARLING)
NADYA:
Danny!
(GASPS)
(GRUNTS)
The angel.
Moreau
said that the Rider
was an angel that went crazy.
(LAUGHING)
I can feel him,
the angel.
I can feel him.
(GASPS)
Danny?
Danny?
Did we win?
I'm gonna say yes.
Hell, yes.
JOHNNY:
My name is Johnny Blaze.
I'm the Ghost Rider.
