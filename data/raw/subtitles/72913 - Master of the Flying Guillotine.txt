in the year 1730, during the reign of
the Emperor Yung Cheng,
one of the early emperors of the
Manchu Ching Dynasty
many kung fu experts were
recruited by the Emperor
to suppress and kill the supporters
of the former Ming Dynasty.
These experts were trained to use
that fearsome weapon
the flying Guillotine.
Many fell to this new weapon.
Those who escaped -went into hiding.
it was to seek these remaining rebels out
and kill them that the
Manchu government sent a noted
Master of the flying Guillotine,
fung Sheng Wu Chi
to keep surveillance of
all Han revolutionists
and kill them if appropriate.
fung, who was blind,
disguised himself as a Buddhist Lama
and lived in a mountain
retreat with his two disciples
Chow-lung. Chow-fu.
One-armed man!
Master fung-sheng,
if you receive this message
it will mean that both of us are dead.
Carved on the tile is an image of
a one armed man
Teacher, he will have killed us and he
is a Ming revolutionary.
We are now setting out to kill him,
but because of his great skill,
we fear that he may kill us.
if you receive this message,
then please avenge your two disciples
Chow-lung, Chow-fu.
You'll be avenged
You sacrificed your lives for
the great Ching Dynasty

One Armed Man and avenge you both

just observing the tournament

this tournament?
Yes that's right.
l am Wu Chang Sheng
and President of
this tournament.
lf you're the president,
l'd like to ask you
why l can't enter the tournament?
The rules are quite specific

but the fact is you are a foreigner
therefore, l must obey the rules.
Sorry.
Sorry, my ass.
Eveyone entering has to sign
a life contract,
because you're a foreigner

l can't be responsible!

-Yes!
-Take our guest to his room!
-Yes!
This way!
Japanese tournament contestant
'Win Without a Knife Y. Yakuma
your room is on the second floor.
-Porter, take him up.
-Yes!
When the Government received news
of the tournament
they were afraid that
the rebel Ming supporters
might choose the opportunity
to stage an uprising.
So they ordered fung Sheng to investigate
and to kill any rebels he discovered there.
fung enlisted the aid of
some of the foreign contestants.
lt was clear
the tournament was destined
to be a bloody affair
Give me some more bottles of wine!
Yes Sir!

Daddy, are you looking for me?
Sit down!
There are some foreigners in

And l have no idea about

Theres no mercy in the ring.

That's something l don't want to see.
Why do you worm
Shao-Tieh, if l hadn't stopped that Thai
he could you have taken his kicks?

Yes! Flying Guillotine Fung Sheng Wu Chi!
Good! l finally get to see
the notorious Flying Guillotine
You've killed senselessly.
Did your masters tell you to do this?
Yes, they did. Now listen,
the One Armed Boxer killed my disciples,
and l've come here to
seek revenge for both of them.
You are a vicious bastard!
You've killed innocent people
in this tournament for no reason.
l intend to make sure
you won't do it again.
You get out of my way!
You old has-been!
l want the One Armed Boxer and
nobody is gonna stop me!
Father!
Gather around!
l'm sorry.
Although we're a new school.
were going to have to close, temporarily.
Why?
Teacher, why should we close?
Can't you guess?
You saw that senseless killing.
Saw it, we all saw it!
The man with the guillotine,
he was sent here by the Chings.
To murder all the kung fu experts here.
Pay attention! l suspect that he may
very well soon pay a visit to our school.
ln that case, a great many of you could be
killed. And l wouldn't want that to happen.
Teacher, has got to be stopped!
Teacher! We must defeat him!
Listen here, l have something to say.
Let me tell you something about that man.
Until recently, he had two assistants
both tough men.
They were both ruthless killers.
A few months ago, the two of them tried to
kill me. However, it didn't quite work out.
Ever since l killed those two disciples,
l've expected this.
But l never expected him to
show up at the tournament.
When he killed that one armed
Hsien Hsing after the fight,
l think he was after me, but
got the wrong man!
Brother, were learning kung fu!
We can't hide for the rest of our lives.
Anyway, you're the One Armed Boxer!
Who says we have to hide?
A man who always escapes
is weak-minded!
A man who depends on kung fu
is a foolish warrior!
These kinds of men are not our idols.
The main fundamental of kung fu
is to act wise and brave.
Since we have not yet found a good plan,
we must see to avoid being
killed and wounded!
The only solution is to protect ourselves.
There's nothing to do here.
Go back to the main school and
tell them to evacuate.
l have heard of your name for a long time,
but you didn't enter the tournament
so l had to come here.
You've come at the wrong time.
l've just closed the school down.
That so?
Trying to escape?
The Flying Guillotine will not let you go,
l have got somebody to bring
the blind man here.
ln fact, he should be here any minute.
You bastard, l'll fix you!
Brother, you get them out of here.
Quick!
That's him!
The one who was talking!
Does he think he can escape?
Who are you?
l'm 'Win Without a Knife Y. Yakuma.
This roof fell.
l saved your life.
So you saved me?
But my father?
Dead.
Those who are dead can never return
so there's no point in crying.
Think of something else.
l already have.
And l can think of nothing else.
All l want to do is to take revenge
on that blind man.
Well don't bother.
You aren't good enough.
Better come with me.
We'll go to Japan.
Go with you, why should l?
You fight quite well.
l could teach you my kung fu.
You shall be my first female student!
You've got potential.
You must be joking.
That isn't my decision. l won't go!
You might not have a choice.
Get some rest.
l'm going to get some food.
Miss Wu!
Who's there?
Don't be frightened!
It's me, the Teacher Yu Tieh Lun!
-The One Armed B...
-Shh!
Just outside Clearwater Town is a cave.
lf you go through the cave,
theres a house in the clearing.
Go and hide there.
After l get my students away
from this place l'll meet you there.
Right!
Pay your respects to Saint Kwan.
The enemy will be here soon.
You go now.
As soon as l have a plan,
l will get in touch.
-You better leave by the back gate.
-Sir!
l guess you've come here to fight.
l'm sorry, it's not convenient.
The One Armed Boxer is a one
winged chicken. When is convenient, eh?
Theres a Chinese saying
to kill a coward is easier
than trying to find a way to insult him.
You're going to be sorry you did that!
l smell blood.
The Indian. He's dead.
He can't escape. Hes somewhere
around this area, l know it.
Miss Wu? My brother is back!
Brother, are you hurt bad?
Nothing serious, l'll be alright.
But that Indian gave me
quite a bit of trouble.
l nearly got caught.
Miss Wu, are you alright?
Yes, thanks.
l feel much better now!
Good. You stay here
as long as you want.
Hsieh Yung,
the students get away alright?
Sure. l saw them off.
They should be clear by now.
Good. Come inside and
we'll have a talk.
Brother Yu, what are you
thinking about?
l was thinking that
bamboo is very tough
and even an axe
can break chopping it!
Why are you thinking about that?
lnside the flying guillotine
theres a ring of knives.
Which can't be thicker than an axe.
That's how we will destroy it.
Really?
Yes! Let's gather my disciples
to discuss a plan!
Blacksmith, do you have
my order ready
Yes Sir!
Thanks.
Good day. Do you want a
large coffin or a small one?
l don't want either.
l want to hire this place.
Hire a coffin shop?
O.K.!
l think l've got the answer,
that's why live called you here.
But still, whether my plan can stop
the flying guillotine remains to be seen.
The strength of the
guillotine lies in its impetus.
Once that spinning force develops,
it's almost impossible to stop it.
The first part of the plan is to get rid of
that foreign Killer Nai Men
Then we can tackle the Guillotine.
And that's where l expect
you men to come in.
Somehow you've got to
get him to come to this place.
Hey, he's coming now!
Come on!
Go to the inn and
you'll find a blind man,
bring him out to the cave.
Quickly!
Light it!
Hope you got thick skin on your feet.
Open up!
Teacher, were you hurt?
l'm alright! But my feet couldn't
have stood much more.
-Take the body away.
- Sir!
l don't want any of you killed.
So get on the other side of
the hills and just wait there. Go!
Yu, l won't go. l want to
stay here with you!
Why?
l want to see you avenge
my fathers death!
No, if you stay here
l can't concentrate.
We might be killed together!
Alright, let's settle it.
Let's see who's the best.
l guessed that you might come.
But l'm afraid you've chosen
an inconvenient time.
l saved her life.
lf she comes with me,
then l'll leave right away.
But otherwise -
Before the blind man comes,
l'll have killed you!
You did save me and
l owe you my life.
But l'm not coming.
That's that!
Miss Wu. It's no use trying to
reason with him. Get back.
We're nearly there!
Get inside.
l'll use the bamboo!
Come on! l've waited long
enough for this!
