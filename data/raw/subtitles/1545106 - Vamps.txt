 Hello. I called Goody, and in 1841 </ i>
 I was bitten by a master vampire. </ i>
 They can awaken the sacrifices they choose </ i>
 not to drain all the blood. </ i>
 Normally it would be </ i>
 a bloody history, - </ i>
 - but I have a bright mind, </ i>
 so I learned to live on animal blood. </ i>
 immortality gave me </ i>
 extra time with my loved ones. </ i>
 night was once dull and dark, </ i>
 but it was better in the 80s. </ i>
 So 1880s. Industrial </ i>
 revolution gave us electricity. </ i>
 Suddenly the night was just as light </ i>
 days. Phones replaced letters. </ I>
 I took the subway around town </ i>
 and could get back in the coffin. </ i>
 In the 1920s, everything really </ i>
 modern. The dresses were shorter. </ I>
 night belonged to swing nonsense States. </ i>
 world was young people, - </ i>
 - and I was an expert at being young. </ i>
 And then came my favorite invention. </ i>
 Film. Chaplin, Keaton, Cagney. </ I>
 people on the film were aged not. </ i>
 I could relate to me. </ i>
 In 1960 clocked me in it. </ i>
 I was so stupid to fall in love. </ i>
 From there it went downhill. </ i>
 In the 70s I'd not men. </ i>
 But in the 90s made my ancestress </ i>
 Stacy. I took care of her. </ I>
 I taught her </ i>
 to acquire land for the coffin, - </ i>
 - to hypnotize </ i>
 and find the artery on a rodent. </ i>
 She taught me about mails, Napster </ i>
 and this cool band Green Day. </ i>
 We partied with the usual - </ i>
 - and went to college. </ i>
I'd been over 300 man-years. </ i>
 But graduation is the day. </ i>
 I love to have a friend, or a </ i>
 best friend, as she puts it. </ i>
 Just look how cute she is. </ i>
Goody. Goody, wake up.
It is sunset.
 The only annoying by Stacy </ i>
 is her bad practical jokes. </ i>
What? It made you just do not.
Let me out.
- You got me.
- Again!
Hurry.
I have a lecture at. eight.
Stacy, your friend from Boston
sent you home soil.
Thank God. I was nearly run out.
I have had so much pain in the back.
"Sorry, but your package
has been damaged. "
The postal service scans all packages
and it has probably seen suspicious.
- But it's just land.
- You know the terror law.
The terrorists have destroyed it all.
"Visit us at www ..."
Why do they call it "visit"?
Is it not rather
to write a letter on your computer?
Visit is when you go somewhere.
- Takes up on a website.
- It makes no sense.
If you turn the pages of a book,
visit you then the new page?
Think that you still can not find
your mouth without a mirror.
- The sun rises at. 6.40.
- Use your app in your mobile.
- I like my almanac.
- What happens to the wife pants?
- It is quite common pants.

See you at work afterwards, right?
 Where are you going? </ i>

Ozzy Osbourne and The Cure. "
Where? Oh no, it's a day.
Who was the spade,
who invented rock concerts a day?

- Was the trap?
I think it was cancer
of the artificial sweetener.

Do not you love Times Square?
It feels like the world's center.

- We do not want to see her suck blood.
- Where are my offspring?
There are of course.
See the new autumn collections.
Gaultier, Prada, Dries.
And I can not see,
how I look at it.
What is the meaning of that look like this,
if I can not enjoy it?
It is bummer.
Take your clothes on,
and so, I imagine, -
- How much better it looks on me.
- Call the pizza man.
- Should not we out to eat?
I feel like pizza man.
The dress comes with you.
Before you forward.
- I do not know about this.
- Why not?
- It is not appropriate for young people.
- What?
Should you tell me about
to be young?
Do you know
how long I have been young?
The crisis means that young people
can not afford the kind of clothes.
- And it's fur. Dead animals.
- Here is the hole in your argument.
Why would a mink life
be worth more than a dove?
- In two drink pigeons every day.
- We let them go free.
Stacy was happy for them.
- It was a mistake to give them names.
- You can not kill a Snoopy.
- Or Zeros bass.
- I is a pity.
Then there is the pizza man.
Pizza Man.
Who ordered extra cheese and sausage?
They said "under 20 minutes".
You've kept me waiting, bad boy.
- I'm sorry.
- Bad boys should be punished.

If there is her something

Sorry.
Juicy!
- My name is Vadim, and it is Ivan.
- I'll get my coat.
- Juicy.

Vadim and Ivan are bad guys.
I like the bad guys.
No, you like cute guys.
You must not

Sweet guys.
Guys who are listening to.
Guys who gives compliments.

- No, I'm already in shock.
So they said, "What about the law?"
"I had to go to play music."
"Why did we have money at uni?"

it's about record contracts.
They are so old-fashioned.

- I need to play something for you.
- You have something ...
- Do you have a stroke?
A little bit will not hurt.
I need to run.
- People can see you.

and finding a fuck.
Once the guys would sing,
be painters or writers.
Now it is about iPod hits
and webisodes. I do not get it.
We must be in group therapy tomorrow.
It always helps.
Was not here
a frozen yogurt place again?
In the 70s it was a methadone clinic.
 hippies sat on the stairs </ i>
 waiting for their medicine. </ i>
In the 50s it was a dance school. All
would be beatniks in the Village.
And before that it was a German newspaper.
- How do you know all this?
- History Channel.
Birds singing!
It is Van Helsing.
Let him pass.
This has nothing to do with
Ministry of Security to do.
- Have you found your neck?
- It's just a dead, unknown man.
Killed and exsanguinated another location,
dismembered and thrown here.
- Empty? The body's bone dry.
- Detective?
Was he Pizza Delivery?
Are you satisfied?
If we find a bomb,
we will call you.
Good evening. My name is Erik.
Welcome to Anonymous Sangvinikere.
Tepes, you are the father, right?
There was one that said that if
a parent parent dies, die offspring.
But you're probably okay,
as long as you avoid the sun?
If one parent master die,
age you just.
Not the same as the day shift.
It is assumed his chronological age.
- When did you wake up?
- In the 1841st
Vårhare!
In addition, the new 80th 200
- Stacy was created in 1992.
- Does she know how old you are?
No. She found solace in,
we had the same age.
- The stems of Cisserus, right?
- Do you know her?
We had a brief affair.
It shaved 100 years of my life.
Tepes, you put out?
Thank you, Eric.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Vlad Tepes.
- Spidderen Vlad.
- Hey, Vlad Tepes!
I abstained from
Homo sapiens' liquids in 362 years.
You've probably heard
what I did to the Turkish army.
The young must learn to replace it,
I can not, -
- With things
not harm others.
I like to knit.
Especially ...
... It here.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Hello, my name is Stacy.
- Hey, Stacy.
I have been in the 20s for two decades.
When I was on the day shift,
I took a lot E.
Ecstasy.
One night, I must have been high,
for I can not remember what -
- But I know
Cisserus drank from me -
- And Goody said she wanted me
as clothing mannequin.
If it were not for Goody,
I would have died. Completely dead.
But she says,
I saved her from loneliness -
- And gave her desire to
continues to exist.
I've never tasted human blood,
but still I am tempted.
But it's like with drugs.
We do not need to rush.
It is better not to do any evil
and have fun with his friends.
Thank you.
Shall we?
When you drink human blood,
is one drop too much -
- And a whole family never enough.
Support your fellow ALF'er.
Udød is not equal to insensitive.
What are you doing?
Do not you hate when the tooth is klammo,
and hugtandsdelen is nice white?
- It's Renfield.
- Hello, Renfield.
- Let's take at Soho House.
- I'm so tired of clubs.
Go there, and if it is
amazing, please write to us.
- J.E.U.
- JE U?
I'm out.
Why can young people do not say
whole words? This nonsense does not save time.
We agreed to move with the times,
although it does not turn 80.
I do not complain about the new hits
and says, Devo is much better.
- You have a blob there.
- Here?
The other side. A little higher.
Are not you tired of
not being able to see yourself?
You must have pictures from back then.

Him in the park signed on here.
Looks like it me?
Yes, he has really
captured the essence of you. Wait a minute.

You're both in town,

But my mother was called Goody.
Did you know her?

Just below.
Stacy, there is something I must tell
you. I'm older than you think.
I helped my father a few years. And
when I read, do you think enough, I'm 20th
But I'm almost 25,
and since you're 17 ..
I am also a little older than the others.
Are you?

someone who protest against it -
- And it is always

Traffickers!
Slavery will share our nation in two.
Abolition of slavery now!
Would you like a pamphlet?

 demonstrations against the Vietnam War. </ i>
Oh no! We go eh our way!
Oh no! We go eh our way!
It must have been crazy to see
your ex How long were you together?
Over a year. We did not live together,
but we saw each other every night.
I had completely forgotten how nice it
is all the time to see someone you love.
I wonder what Joey's parents think of me?
- What do you think about Stacy?
- She's a little bleach in it.
- What do you think?
- Your mother think ...
- She is extraordinarily white.
- So you do not like her skin color?
- You're dramatizing.
- She's not like us.
Wealthy, of trained
and paranoid monster hunters?
- She is udød, damn it!
- You think all vampires.
Just because you're up late,
has not necessarily fangs!
Beings without warm blood in his veins ...
Just because you're skinny,
drink not blood.
- You are so intolerant!
- Stop that! Both of them.
Let's invite her to dinner.
Is she one of them, as we see it.
Okay.
Tonight we meet the
sad circumstances.
You've probably all heard of David
tragic accident summer.
A century you are here,
and the next you're gone.
- Can you feel something obnoxious?
- Yes.
- We have a new participant.
- Yes. Hey. My name is Rita.
I psi-vampire.

I live off other people's auras.
I absorb their energies.
How do you know

Psi-vampires are real vampires.
We do not shed blood for ...
Okay, calm down.
We must be more careful,
when we announce our meetings.
Stacy is invited as a jury member.
She has not voted since the 80s.
It was I off.
Consult stamvampyrer and cannibals.
- How do we Cisserus?
- Do you not know where she rests?
She summons us.
We'll never get to her.
- Now we must work together.
- Our species are being persecuted.
I've seen it before. Instead
for torches have computers now.
By mr. Davidoff you are here?
Mr. Davidoff is informed
we are between 7 and 12
- Should I not have a warrant?
- They will think we are from the police.
I'm from Time Warner, and you will
see "Jon Stewart" again, then lock up.
Let's get some light in here.
Good morning, my friend.
Buenas noches , chicas. </ i>
Have you seen Ivan?
- He did not come as summoned.
- We saw him last week.
He is not strong enough
to ignore you.
So should I just replace him.
But we are only good for
to endure and light office work.
Fold this gently together,
and you pack the soil.
Are not you just love
these TV-shop bags?
See how much land there is room for.
There will be a meeting for
all stamvampyrer and ALF'er.
- Many have been persecuted.
- So what?
If you continue in this way,
they find you.
No one takes my stay.
It is the only place
no New Yorker will.
Your behavior hurts everyone else.
Vlad Tepes and his åndsboller?
Spidderen Vlad?
You know what it spidderi went out on?
He compensated.
In addition, I am going away.
Check out this cool travel coffin,
he was doing to me.
Here is my itinerary.
Get me checked in as cargo
before dawn. It is a private.
- What's in Spain?
- There is not just snails on the road.
Look at him. Diego Bardem. The
beautiful and talented man in the world.
- Do you know him?
- No, but I am so down with him.
And listen here.
I will not hypnotize him.
It must be true.
I have not felt that way for some
since Al Jolson.
- Ham from "Mammy"?
- Yes, the guy from "Mammy".
He was fantastic. You understand the
not because you have not seen him live.
No, no, no.
Hey. What did
your parents about me?
 Are you at your computer? </ i>
 Come on iChat. I want to see you. </ I>
- I do not have iChat.
- Yes, it is built.
Yes, but my flatmate
came to paint the webcam above.
- What did your parents?
- They thought you were a little pale.
- What do you think?
- Bleaching. Light-skinned. Maybe a little sick.
It is sparepærernes fault.
Everyone looks ugly out in the light.
They will hear
Whether you come for dinner on Friday.
I'm coming.
Tanning Salon
Stand still.
- Beautiful, is not it?
- It works. I will be mega brown.
Hey.
- You look ...
- Tough out?
Yes. Come on.
Let me be your guide.
- What's the deal?
- My grandfather and great-grandfather's things.
My dad is an expert on vampires.
My family is crazy.
What is it?
If someone you think is the vampire dies, so
puts you on here over the corpse's neck.
If they wake up and will crawl out
of the coffin, they beheaded.
Then there is the food.
- I know him!
- Do you know him?
- I know who he is. Vlad Tepes.
- It's pronounced "Teepeece".
He was
one of history's greatest sadists.
It may well be discussed.
Well? Is it for discussion whether
should impale people and drink their blood?
His illness prevented number
Ottomans to conquer Europe.
His armor is exhibited
in Bucharest. They see him as a hero.
Were it not for him,
we would all talk Ottoman.
You did not like fish?
Do you want anything else?
No thanks, mrs. Van Helsing.
I really enjoy the food.
You should taste the soup.
It's an old family recipe.
- Not the big fond of garlic?
- No, it's salt.
Just a little salt,
and I rise like a balloon.
My dad thinks we do not kiss,
if we get garlic breath.
It did not.
Mom, we eat dessert later.
The film begins at 21.30.
They have a strong will.
- What do you want with my son?
- What do you think?
You will suck the life out of him.
Not more than other lovers will.
- Are you ready?
- Thanks for dinner.
We'll see.
- Did you see her? Is she one of them?
- I was not so aware.
She was quite dark skin,
but we look at the footage.
I can not remember, there were empty
chairs. What have I done wrong?
Nothing.
Why do people out if they just want to
looking at the little glowing boxes?
You sound like my grandmother.
There is Renfield course.
Listen. We can only sit here, if we
order a bottle for $ 400.
Bottle seating.
They were observed for ten minutes ago.
It must be good sex.
- We have not done it yet.
- So it's pure text?
I've been looking for you,
your lifeless bitch.
- What happens to you?
- What have you done to Ivan?
First you destroy it
with the daftige girl.
- And now Ivan ford won.
- You mild dineser!
Hello!
Not in the eyes of day shift.
You remember nothing
the last few minutes.
- I know nothing. I saw nothing.
- Stop that.
And why should we do anything Ivan?
So put Cisserus us in work.
You must come to
a Anonymous Sangvinikere meeting.
You do not become a member. We
fear that they will force us out in the sun.
Is that why
Ivan disappeared?
- Maybe. So his neighbors something?
- They said cable-TV people were there.
Can Time Warner well just barge in
and kill people?
Come to the meeting. We must do something.
- All smoking for reckoning.
- You do not show up.
IRS believes you have to pay
more in taxes. It can do.
You need only attend,
If you have objections.
- How do you know that?
- I am a certified public accountant.
- You just got new customers.

Do not you want something to drink?
- No thanks.

- This is from last week, so ...
- Do you work for the state?

I'm in the middle of a deportation,
where they have listened to people illegally.
I thought they would stop if the
not heard anything terror-related?
No.
See here. I've been looking
after pictures of your mother.
See here. She slipped always,
just before the picture was taken.
- She was superstitious.
- It's a little crazy. Godfather!
- This newspaper I have.
- Have you? Saved she on?
- Add the rather in a folder.
- Did she like this picture?
I then also okay then.
What a great time it was.
Being young and in love and feel
as part of something important.
Does your mother said,
why she disappeared?
Not really.
You know what? I'll pick up some
film to my wife before they close.
- How wacky.
- Huh
That we going the same way.
Cool.
Angela easily fall asleep,
so it must be movies she loves.
So she can keep up with,
although she dozes off.
- Can I help?
- No. I know what I'm looking for.
So I see me around.
Do you have any

Stop it.
Relax.

Run them to the hospital.
And stop stealing.
You were bitten by your cat.
I had to learn first aid.
You hate junk food.
And get "Society enemy"
with Cagney.
Are you okay? I could have
hypnotized you -
- But I would still
tell you now.
So you broke up with me,
because you would not drink my blood?
- I do not drink human blood!
- What did you do to him man?
Oh no.
Have you never seen a vampire bat?
A small rodent can suck all the blood
out of a cow in a few minutes -
- As a result of an enzyme in their saliva,
a harmless blood thinner.
I have too.
I did not drink the man's blood.
I spat at him
in order to stop the stroke.
Well, you just spit on him?
It's something completely different.
- Otherwise he would have been brain damaged.
- How old are you?
- A little older than you.
- So you only socialize with people in a year's time?
It takes seven years
before people aback about it.
I would have been with you
as long as possible.
But when you became politically active,
were you recognized by people on the street.
I thought:
"It is his glory."
You could get just the woman
you would have.
It seemed wrong to rob you
the chance to meet a beautiful woman.
And you met the one.
Did not you?
Yes, I did.
And I'd better see
how she feels.
But I must say that I have it,
as if it's the wildest trip.
I see you again?
Yes, of course.
It is Germany
before World War II.
Because of rascality curse
søvngængeren, murdering his people.
- I'm not.
- Germany. A curse.
- Adolf.
- Your eyes remind me of someone.
- Adolf Hitler.
- No, not him.
Audrey Hepburn. Same initials.
Concentrate now on symbolism.
Do you not curse me? Or I
could cast a spell on you.
- What would you have me do?
- To laugh hysterically.
Holy shit.
Have you tried it that way before?
Not since the 80s.
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting early.
- Truancy.
- It does not. I'll call you later.
My parents come first in the morning.
It is too early to talk about it.
I have to go.
Call me.
What the ..?!
- Is there something wrong?
- What?
If you want to talk about it,
if there are problems with Stacy ...
Would not you like!
He answers neither of my text messages
tweets, emails, phone messages ...
- Gossip to his father?
- No.
- Gossip Danny to the authorities?
- No.
- He hates authorities.
- I confront Joey.
Are you mad at me?
Do not just go.
- Honestly?
- Yes.
So every night there ...
garlic vines.
- You were afraid of them yesterday.
- I've always hated garlic.
- We need to talk about it.
- My father warned me.
I've never done
a human or animal matter.
- You just wanted a Van Helsing.
- No, it kept me as rather away.
If I wanted to drink your blood,
I would have written ten pages -
- On Freud's influence
the surrealists?
How do I know
you wrote it for me?
I also wrote about surrealism
formation about the First World War.
- The I better like.
- Can you do it?
- Do you trust me now?
- You will have the best character.
You know,
I would never hurt you.
Is it all dagproblematikken? Do you
could walk on the beach with your boyfriend?
No, I'm natmenneske.
Is it blood?
Will you at the restaurant?
- I'm not gourmet.
- What is it?
I hate,
when my parents are right.
Now, you see.
Thank you!
Write now under.
Hey. Come on.
Hello, Renfield.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Yes.
- It can not generate you.
- Yes, you hurt yourself.
- So wake me.
- How it works not.
You are accountant. Clear it out. If
all vampires drank the blood of others -
- Would people eating
each other before the birth of Christ.
Only a master vampire can wake you up.
- Is it the Tepes have knitted?
- Yes, he should see, I use it.
He also knit one for you.
I will tell you, folks.
This is fantastic.
Apart from Cisserus we have collected
all the area's ancestors.
- Vadim from Russia.
- Ukraine.
Aswan from Kush.
- Ghuri, the Turkish ancestor.
- Hello, Ghuri.
First let me hear how many
which has been summoned to court?
Excuse me, but why
we eat not just lawyers?
Are you mad? We can not
eat all the lawyers.
- Why not?
- It is excluded.
I can probably mark
here are people from the day shift.
- This is my granddaughter, Sarah.
- Hi, Sarah.
It is our friend Renfield. He is
accountant and expert in tax matters.
And there was also
have a lawyer present?
Hi there. My name is Danny.
I am civil rights lawyer.
I will not be forced out during the day.
And I do not want
your resting places desecrated.
But according to the law, the state must
break into with you anytime.
All your mobiles -
- IPhones and computers
makes you easier to find.
I must warn you against
using electronic equipment.
How should we contact each other?
- I used to write things down.
- Well, in such a calendar.
But the PC tells me,
when the sun goes up and down.
It can be seen in my almanac.
Here, moon phases, tides,
sunrise and-drop and ...
- Oh, my goodness!
- What?
Total solar eclipse in two weeks!
Wait a minute.
14.10 to 15.40.
A shame it's not there, we are
summoned. So we could use hypnosis.
It is no obstacle.
Can not we just move the agreements?
We may delete you from the system.
We may change depending on their PCs.
Now I understand better,
why you do not drink human blood.
- Cool! If you go over on our side?
- Will the ladies be my wives?
Bite your teeth.
Not literally!
Are you okay?
You also threw up yesterday.
Look what I got for you.
Cleanest, pharmaceutical quality.
But they're cute. Not pests.
They could be a pet.
- They do not give nausea.
- I'm fine.
- It is only when I get up.
- Not the nøleri. We gotta go.
I do not want to hear it.
It's in again with low waist.
- According to whom?
- I saw Keira Knightley in it.
That is,
because she plays in a movie.
- You would not want to talk!
- It's from my college time.
Would you football team?
I have nothing more modestly.
I had completely forgotten,
how it is.
It's a completely different world.
- How many women.
- Have a nice day.
Come on, everybody.
We only have two hours.
- You do what my accountant says.
- Accountant.
It is Ghuri.
Case number 3-18.
It is Vlad Tepes.
He was granted asylum in. ..
The 1583rd
He is now married to
a U.S. citizen.
Four.
The mother is engaged
with an American.
... Study visa so he can be
enrolled at UCLA.
DELETE
Recycle
Stacy Daimer is unable to
to appear as a juror.
... Unable
to appear as a juror.
- Delete the call.
- Add deleted names in the trash.
Empty the trash. Ask the IT guy on
remove the hard drive.
Sorry!
THE HAPPY NIGHTS ARE BACK
Close it up now.
Keep it up.
Beautiful colors for you!
There are bogreception
right now on the tenth floor. What do you say?
It's not worth it.
All New York's famous there.
I can get just who it should be.
It gets tired of.
- I love that song.
- Shall we dance?
- Do not you dance?
- I'm not good at dancing.
- Yes, you are. I can remember.
- I can not.
SPANISH IDOL GONE
- Joey went because his dad freaked.
- There are enough problems in the office.
- Who can it be?
- Is not that wild?
I have been dating for 25 years, but I
've never had it like this.
- What about you and Danny?
- I still love him.
But his wife's illness.
I just enjoy
to be with him.
Would not it be cool
If we both had a girlfriend?
-  Mott Street </ i>
- Why is she already back?
- It was probably not with Diego.
- Now it otherwise as well.
- I've never seen really dead.
- What have you done?
I know how it is,
when you eat Chinese.
Half an hour later
you are hungry again.
- How could you do this?
- I eat constantly.
I am so depressed.
Why could he not like me?
I'm as wild hotter
than his girlfriend.
Maybe she was not
a murderous psychopath.
- It's really disgusting!
- Yes.
I could easily hate myself,
but one day with fråderen -
- Makes me's not bad
throughout the weekend.
What's with him?
Make him not just done?
I said, "Beat him to death."
I really can not kill.
In're totally inept.
Forget it.
Is it not even a fortune cookie?
- It was at the last minute.
- Now I kistehår tomorrow.
- Goody, I can not do again.
- I can not.
VAMPIRES!
We must of course adapt.
It no longer makes sense
to be violent.
She does not belong to us.
She is insane.
Surely!
Is there some sort of doctor for us?
Stacy is sick.
We can not be sick.
No, but she throws up every night,
when we stand up.
How old was she,
when she was awakened?
- 20th
- I suppose she has a boyfriend?
- Why?
- She is pregnant.
- Can she have children?
- No, she miscarry naturally.
- Unless she becomes vice versa.
- So if Cisserus door?
Cisserus ...
Just take it easy.
Stacy is fine again
a week's time.
We were told about a patient
a bidesår.
They found surveillance tape.
- Where's the body?
- At Mount Sinai Hospital.
Sit down,
and listen carefully.
You think I'm crazy,
but you must do something for me.
You must have it here for you
day and night.
See how you let it.
You may only use silver bullets.
- Against whom? Stacy?
- Keep it on you! Not bullshit.
If there is famine,
so grab a cup nøddemysli.
Comedian? He's not the least bit funny.
I've never seen him in anything.
- What do you see?
- An insult to those with talent.
The great 80s cavalcade.
Show it to Goody.
My father has taken on
give me this.
- Strange ...
- Beware, there are silver bullets in.
What's he doing?
He was paranoid,
since he saw the tape from the hospital.
A guy who flew
to the main entrance.
Where am I stupid! I forgot
everything about cameras.
- Have you?
- We have not done anything.
- It was our ancestress Cisserus.
- She's a monster.
- She spoils it for all of us.
- Take it easy. We speak with Tepes.
I just talked to him.
He said, you soon feel better.
You're just pregnant.
- What? Am I Pregnant?
- We must have a child!
Whoa!
Am I really pregnant?
Would you like to have a child?
Yes! I am over 40 years.
It is the last chance.
And I will be a great, babe father.
Forget about cell phones, iPhones,
PowerBooks and iPads.
Hooray.
Now I can clear all my needs
with my new mini-iPad.
- It looks like your mobile.
- But can not call.
I can tweet, email, be
Facebook, get reminders ...
So you can read thousands of
unimportant messages and advertisements -
- And your acquaintances brain vomit?
You sound as nicely hormonal.
Maybe you are also pregnant.
So now you learn something new shit
to know -
- There is no better than the old one,
which is not compatible with the new one.
Just to blogging
and look stupid docu-soaps.
It all goes too fast!
And I'm tired.
I am sick of it all!
We do not get mini-iPads.
See. They had only a few channels.
But they had Groucho Marx.
It is not Groucho.
He had a mustache.
And glasses and cigar.
-  Who was buried in Grant's tomb? </ I>
- Were people really that stupid?
- He just wanted to make sure they won.
- Located Grant's Tomb in New York?
- No.
- Yes.
- Have you been there?
- No.
There it is!
It is the place
no New Yorker will.
Cisserus choose as a monument
and so even a grave!
- You got a right.
- Come on.
Can I see?
I can feel it, but I
thought you would have a child before me.
Is it strange? Now that ...
You must make a decision
independent of me or Joey.
The child survives only
If you are reversed.
- But then the Cisserus the die.
- That's right.
I would be in their 40s.
But I wanted to be a mother.
- You would also be older.
- Yes.
It also affects my you. How has
you feel about not being young anymore?
Should I miss going to clubs
and date all the idiots?
It would be nice not to have to
fake nostalgia for the 90s series.
- And all the stupid abbreviations.
- And the clothes and the music.
There is no longer anything new to
To stay young.
And then we get a child.
But we can not kill Cisserus.
She has endured for centuries.
Because no one knew her stay.
But she is very strong,
and we have some cake arms.
Yes, but she is sloppy and pretentious.
We call in the big boys.
- Who?
- Your future father in law.
I just need to achieve one thing before.
Did you know that you will do everything
to win a little more time?
Will you be natmenneske and love me
only let her eat animals?
Can you keep her alive?
- Not really alive ...
- But not even death?
I can not, but he can.
Yes! I do not want to lose her.
I will not be disturbed.
That's enough.
As long as it does not take.
You have a sweet wife.
So I just want to hear
how you two have together?
Is there any chance,
In that split?
Danny.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Now close up!
- Who is it?
One of your son's friends.
I will help you.
- Will you help me?
- I have good news grandfather.
Did you grandpa?
I thought all the victims were vampires
or dead.
I've never heard of inversions.
I have not seen it for myself,
but if you are young enough ...
They can not be used for anything.
And it's not just Joey's rebellion?
- Is it serious between them?
- I've never seen Stacy so happy.
He welcomes such to
to become a father. It is true love.
- When did you wake up?
- In the 1841st
I survived
and asked her to create me.
- Would you like to be a vampire?
- It was the lesser of two evils.
In 1840 hit a cholera epidemic
Manhattan.
It was a painful and undignified death.
My husband and my sisters
had passed away.
But my kids had done it.
I had digestive problems.
It is one of the first symptoms.
Orphaned had a hard time.
- Survived your children then?
- My son was less than 63 years old.
And my daughter married
Peter Meester and was 99 years.
It was unheard of back then.
Most older've not
a young, strong mother for help.
I disappeared when the grandkids
came to. I would have scared them.
- Did you get it?
-  Yes. </ I>
The only way out is
to behead her.
Everything else makes her just mad.
And when Cisserus is dead
Stacy will be a normal girl.
Yes, of her being.
- What happens to you?
- I saved my family.
Now we need to save your.
Here is your family tree.
Your descendants.
Your great-great-great-great-grandson ...
...'m An addict.
He is in prison.
Four doctors.
One of them in Doctors Without Borders.
Two professors, four teachers
and in the House of Representatives -
- Jane Rutherford,
Chairman of several committees.
- She looks like you.
- Thank you.
Good. Let rifles lie.
Take axes, scythes, all with blades.
Well so. Now necks we
the dried bitch.
I'll also rare
but you meet nice people there.
I'll never there.
I can not believe I met you.
- You are beautiful.
- Where are you sweet.
- Shall we sit?
- Certainly.
- Here is nice.
- Yes, is not there?
Is your wife not worried
where you are so late at night?
She is traveling. What she
do not know, she has not hurt.
- You are surely a bad boy.
- I can be very bad.
What does a bad boy like you?
I am a dentist.
Are you dentist?
There I was probably lucky.
I have a problem,
What worries me very much. See here.
I've never seen anything so ...
No! No!
Run!
- Your asshole.
- Come on.
Naughty girls!
I am very disappointed in you.
I have done so much for you.
And this is the thanks?
How to care for
his ancestress.
There is no powder in the!
Duk you!
- We did it!
- No. She must be into the grave.
Have I got such a flat ass?
Can I just say ...
- What do we do to the body?
- The door in a moment.
- Where were you?
- You asked me to take a chainsaw.
- But it lacked gasoline.
- You should have thought of before!
- I thought it ran on electricity.
- Are there electrical outlets in the woods?!
- Like a hairdryer ...
- Joey!
 I will praise the Lord come </ i>
 I have seen His glory </ i>
 He squashing grapes of wrath </ i>
 world he subject </ i>
- Come on!
- It's just too much.
Hurry up!
Throw it in!
- Can you feel anything?
- No.
Wait a minute.
Was that it?
You were just 20 years old?
I have not drunk, smoked,
taken drugs or sunbathe.
You may not have as good genes
but with a little laser surgery ...
You did not lie about your age, do you?
No call their children
Goody for longer.
- You will not be even older, right?
- It's okay.
I've been here long enough.
I'm tired.
I should have guessed it. History
Channel only shows films about Hitler.
Before I met you,
I was ready to go out in the sun.
You taught me to have fun.
- Is there anything we can do for you?
- Yes. I would not be standing here.
- I will stand in the midst of chaos.
- Come on.
Are you okay?
- Are you okay? How are you?
- I'm hungry.
- I could eat a pretzel.
- Loading you not just one, Joey?
Goody? Goody?
You mild.
- I saw good.
- She was the one who checked me out.
Now remember,
I gave you my life's best years.
Not five or ten years, right?
Eternity you.
- Do you realize how long it is?
- I'm starting to feel it.
Now you just see Goody.
- For scary.
- Is it scary?
There did you grandfather.
