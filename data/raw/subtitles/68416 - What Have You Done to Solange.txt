- Why not?
- It's what I want too, Enrico.
I want it as much as you do.
But not like this.
You love me, but you don't trust me.
True?
- No.
- Soon, I'll take care of everything.
You'll see.
It's just a question of time.
Elizabeth, I want you to be happy.
- What is it?
- Over there, on the bank.
I saw someone.
- For heaven's sake!
What does it matter?
No-one can see us.
I can't be much of a lover if you prefer
admiring the scenery.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to close my eyes
and not think of anything.
There! A knife! I saw it.
I saw it!
What did you see this time?
I get it. You could have invented
a better excuse.
It's all because of the education
you got at that damned school.
All they do is teach you
a load of rubbish.
You should never have gone there,
there's always something
that stops you behaving
like a normal girl.
Come on, get out.
So where is it? Has it vanished?
What kind of a knife was it?
A dagger? Maybe a sword?
Did the archangel Gabriel
come to punish you for your sins?
Stop it!
You can be so cruel sometimes.
Okay, but I've had enough now.
Come on, stop crying. Tidy yourself up.
My uncle and the school
have nothing to do with this.
I saw a knife. I really did!
It wasn't my imagination.
Take me home. Please.
This is the 7.30 radio news.
The international Euratom meeting
has ended in...
Can't you put on some music?
Despite a breach of the London treaty
Where are you?
In local news, an horrific crime
took place in London this morning.
At dawn this morning,
an angler found..."
raising the suspicion of the police,
who rushed to the scene.
So far, only preliminary
investigations have been possible,
as there are no clues
to the victim's identity
In sport today...
- Why did you change the channel?
- Why shouldn't I?
- Did you hear what they said?
Of course I did!
Could you be any more rude?
Oh, sure. Nothing must disturb
our domestic bliss!
It's all you've thought about
for five years.
All I want is a little respect.
Yes sir,
we're waiting for the ambulance.
The coroner is already here, over.
Stay back. No-one's allowed here.
It looks like she was strangled.
- No, they used a knife.
- What knife?
I saw her, she didn't have any wounds.
At last! Professor Rosseni,
they're waiting for you.
- Park my car please.
- In the headmaster's office,
everyone's there, including the police.
Now we're all here, inspector.
All the teachers from the second year,
including the gym teacher.
- I also teach Italian. - You're an
hour late Mr Rosseni, it's unacceptable.
My car broke down.
I couldn't find a taxi,
I had to wait for repairs.
Inspector Barth of Scotland Yard.
- Pleased to meet you.
Let's not waste any time. - Sure.
- Please look at these photos.
- Professor Newton, German and history.
Father Webber, chemistry and biology.
Please look at them carefully.
Professor Joseph Kane,
history and philosophy.
Professor Erta Rosseni, maths.
A necessary formality.
Professor Enrico Rosseni.
You've already met.
Oh my God! It's Hilda Ericson.
- Yes.
- Who was it?
We don't know yet.
We only have her name
because her parents
reported her missing yesterday.
Now I have to tell them we've found her.
Thank you all. If I need you again,
I'll be in touch.
Goodbye Mr Rich.
- Goodbye inspector.
You're Italian aren't you?
- Is that significant?
- No, it's not.
My husband has lived
in London for many years.
I know. Goodbye Professor.
You're students are waiting for you.
Tell them what's happened.
I'm entrusting you with this task.
For once, your friendship
with the students will be of use.
Be tactful and don't go into detail.
Girls, this isn't a ballet school.
Relax and pay attention.
Sadly, I have some bad news.
You'll have noticed that
Hilda Ericson isn't here today.
Something very serious has happened.
There's been a tragedy.
- Is she dead?
Come on Janet, don't cry.
When did it happen?
- Yesterday afternoon.
I knew it. I knew she'd been killed.
That's true. How do you know, Brenda?
Last night her mum rang
to ask if she was with me.
She was very worried.
Hilda never comes home late.
I understand.
- What happened to her?
- I've no idea.
Excuse me, Rosseni.
I thought my presence might help.
Girls, come with me to church.
Sorry, I can only stay ten minutes,
I have to go back to school.
I guess you knew about Hilda's death.
- When did it happen?
- Yesterday afternoon.
In the woods, by the river bank.
What can you tell me?
Did you see the murderer?
No, all I saw was a vague shadow.
I don't know how to describe it.
I'm sure it was a man,
but there was something odd.
Odd? In what way?
I'm not sure, I can't remember.
Should I tell the police?
Listen to me! You can't always
do what you want.
Forgive me.
Darling, don't you understand?
We were together.
You have to be aware of that.
I need time to tell Erta,
to make her understand
that I'm in love with you.
Can you imagine the scandal at school?
You're in your last year.
You're right.
Especially where
you're wife is concerned.
- Where did you go this morning?
- I don't need more questions.
You don't even care what people think!
You're tired of me and
you can't even hide it.
You've never been able to lie.
I only have to look at you.
That ridiculous story
about the car breaking down.
It wasn't ridiculous, I wasn't lying.
Do me a favour and leave me alone.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- Why did you go to the crime scene?
- Simple curiosity.
So it was just an impulse.
When did you go?
I left home at eight,
ten minutes past at the latest.
And at 8.30 you were already there...
twenty minutes.
- Is there a problem?
- No I'm just curious.
How could someone find such
a secluded place in 20 minutes?
I heard the news on the radio.
Don't you remember?
Of course.
"A man who'd gone fishing at dawn
found the body by the river.
"He called the police and
they went straight to the scene.
"They could only make
preliminary investigations
"as there were no clues
to the victim's identity."
For you to get there so soon
is extraordinary.
You could have been anywhere.
I wasn't alone. There were dozens
of people. Isn't that strange?
Passersby, curious because
of the police presence.
- So the killer always returns
to the scene of the crime? - No.
But you're hiding something from me,
and I don't like it.
When was the girl killed?
According to the newspapers,
the coroner has yet to decide.
I'll tell you. Between 5.00 and 5.30,
just before sunset.
Where were you at that time, Mr Rosseni?
- I was driving around town.
- Alone? - Alone.
I'd argued with my wife.
I needed to calm down.
I understand. You can go.
Is that it?
Yes. Feel free to come back anytime.
Hilda Ericson was your student.
She chose Italian, not French...
because you're a young,
good-looking and tolerant teacher,
always at odds with the old guard.
Now she's dead. That's right. Dead.
But that's not what's bothering you.
You're worried about something else.
- Did she suffer when she was killed?
- For a long time.
The killer wounded her fatally.
She was in agony for an hour.
An hour is along time.
Well? How are things going?
These are casts
of the footprints we found.
We know they were made
yesterday afternoon.
This cast is the victim's footprint.
- And this? - It was found about
100 metres from the corpse.
I'll send it to the lab for prints.
- Where'd you find this pin? - On the
victims clothes. - They're here sir.
- I'm coming. Are those x-rays ready?
- They're still drying.
Fine. Carry on.
- Why can't we see our daughter's body?
- I'm inspector Barth. Have a seat.
I'm in charge of this investigation.
I'll take you to see your daughter
in good time. Take notes, sergeant.
Mr Ericson, you're aware
that I need to know everything,
even if it doesn't seem
important or relevant.
Yesterday was Sunday.
Please try to recall the day's events.
We didn't go out in the afternoon.
We went to mass with Hilda...
She went to confession,
then she took communion.
You were going to say something
about the afternoon.
My wife and I stayed in.
Do you remember dear?
We watched a cricket match on TV.
Then we began to wonder
why Hilda hadn't come home.
She'd never been late before.
At what time did you begin to worry?
Around 7 or 8. We started ringing
some of her school friends.
But they hadn't seen her.
- So Hilda didn't go out with them?
Did you believe what her
friends told you? No doubts?
I don't understand these kids.
Your daughter was hardly a child.
Maybe she had a boyfriend.
I think she would have told me.
Wouldn't she?
Well, that's all for now.
Please excuse me.
I have a question, Mr Barth.
Was Hilda raped?
Miss Boorman!
In a way, she was. Please, follow me.
Be strong, Mr Ericson.
The killer left the knife there.
- Yes, Father. - Alone?
- No, there were other girls.
Yes Father, but I'm not brave enough.
There was someone else.
I'll get it, uncle!
Oh, it's you.
It's for me.
I've a surprise for you. You don't care?
I haven't seen you for a week.
What is it?
- Who are you talking to?
No-one, I'm alone. Where?
You have to guess. Let's see if you can.
I nearly forgot the keys.
I'll leave them here.
Don't be like that Elizabeth.
Honestly, I want to see you darling.
- I'll put these in a vase for you.
Who are you talking to?
I can't tell you,
it's part of the surprise.
Don't forget, whatever you need,
I'm next door.
No, no.
Let's test your female intuition.
- Do you like it?
- You devil! Tell me where you are.
I can't stay on the phone for ever.
Evelyn Gardens, number 8.
It's the door by the lift.
- Going out?
- I'm off to Deborah's to study.
- Was that Deborah on the phone?
- Yes.
'Bye for now, colonel.
- Don't be late.
- I'm not Little Red Riding Hood!
I know, but after what happened...
Don't worry, I'm not like Hilda
and I don't go down to the river.
'Bye!
- So you do love me after all.
- Don't be stupid!
- Close your eyes. Follow me.
- Why?
Come on.
What do you think, my princess?
- Now I understand.
It's a trap! My favourite flowers,
my favourite music.
This can be our hideaway until...
It must be a wrong number.
- Why don't you answer it?
Hallo?
See? They hung up. I knew it.
Would you like a tour?
This is the kitchen.
Or mini-kitchen rather.
The bathroom is fantastic!
Nice! So, is that it?
Where do we make love? In the bath?
- You're wonderful!
The knife! I thought
I was being stabbed!
HILDA ERICSON
Their written Italian is awful.
Even Goethe preferred Italian.
Any example will do:
We say 'palm of the hand'...
you say 'plate of the hand'.
Schiller was right,
Italian is the language of the angels.
While German is harsh and useless,
like me.
You need things to be soft,
sensitive and above all, new.
Erta, please!
I'm trying to help you,
you've wanted to tell me
something for a while now,
you talk around the subject, but you're
never brave enough to confront it.
Not even in the sweet tones
of your fine language.
What was going on with you and Hilda?
Why did you rush to see the body?
Did you sleep with her as well?
- Have you gone mad?
How can you say such a thing?
You'll have to try harder than that
if you want me to believe you.
Please, come in.
- Mr Barth.
- Good evening
You're just in time for an aperitif.
Please, have a seat.
A whisky? How do you take it?
- With ice and soda, thanks.
I gave you a week,
but you've let me down.
So I decided to take the initiative.
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to warn you of my visit.
I'd like to recap.
I'm sorry, do you have a pen?
- There's one next door, dear.
Isn't that your pen on the table?
Thank you.
I have a few questions for you.
- I'll leave you both alone.
- That's very kind of you.
We found a pen like this
at the scene of the crime.
- Left there by the killer?
- Or a witness.
Fine... There is more I can tell you,
but on the condition that
it stays between us.
I didn't see anything on that day
by the river bank,
but the person I was with thought
they saw someone on the bank.
It was an intimate moment
that I didn't want to interrupt.
A knife! I saw it!
I thought it was just an excuse.
Then I heard the news bulletin.
So I rushed off to the river
like a fool.
That's it, honestly.
- Elizabeth Seccles?
- Exactly.
The niece of Colonel Douglas Seccles.
You realise I'll have to question her.
I'll be discrete
but if her answers lead me
to the killer, this will all come out.
She saw some shadows in the trees,
what good is that?
All it can do is cause more problems,
for both you... and me.
- Good evening sir.
- 'Bye! Have a good time.
- Hallo? - Mr Bryant?
- Sorry, my uncle's not in.
- Is that you Janet?
- Yes, of course.
Good evening Janet.
I'm Helen's father.
- Mr Rodman...
I'm sorry,
I didn't recognise your voice.
Helen wanted to borrow your Italian
text book, she can't find hers.
She has a test tomorrow morning.
I'm not far from your house,
I'd be grateful if you'd lend it to me.
Sure, no problem.
Wait! You're...
Hallo?
What, now? Right away?
Okay, I'm coming.
Don't bother Enrico,
don't say anything.
Calm down, darling. What's wrong?
I had that nightmare again,
but this time, it was clearer.
I know who was chasing Hilda.
I told you something was odd,
now I remember.
It's clearer now. He was wearing
black robes, like a priest.
- What can you tell me Mrs Holden?
- My dog was barking all night,
but he always does!
Today, I came it out into the garden,
and I tripped over her. Why here?
Why did it happen here?
- Janet was killed last night!
- What?
- Professor!
- What is it?
- I need to talk to you.
- Fine, go ahead.
I may know something
about what happened,
about Helen's death.
This latest tragedy could have terrible
consequences for the school.
Professor Bascombe,
why is Miss Seccles with you?
She's just told me something
we all need to hear.
With your permission.
- Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Tell them everything you said to me.
You see... Mr Leach, that afternoon,
on the Sunday that Hilda was killed,
I was there. I was boating on the river,
I saw something...
- What did you see?
I saw the killer chasing Hilda,
and again while he was killing her.
And you waited until a second girl died
before telling us?
But I didn't know,
the professorjust told me.
That's true, Elizabeth spoke to me
before I broke the bad news.
Please, continue.
At the time, it was very confusing,
I couldn't really see.
But later, as I thought about it...
- Go on.
Now, I'm sure the killer
wore a long black robe.
In other words, a priest.
- Yes. - And what were you doing?
Fishing?
No Mr Newton, I was with a boy.
Just as I thought.
There's nothing wrong with that,
your boyfriend may be able to help.
No! He didn't see anything.
He didn't even believe me.
- Did you see this priest's face?
Would you recognise him?
- I don't know.
I can't be sure.
Maybe. If I see him again.
Thanks for not giving me away!
I'll see you this afternoon,
before I go to the police station.
Try to be more subtle. Don't worry,
I'm the only one who knows.
But neither of you are good at lying.
- I suppose you disapprove.
- Of course.
I understand though. I knew at once
you were the boy on the boat.
I told the inspector
everything last night.
- What about your wife?
- No, not yet.
Of course professor, thank you.
Thanks for being understanding.
Darling! I'm in here.
Take another.
Get all her clothes.
Be careful.
Don't touch anything.
What time did you say you arrived?
Around four o'clock.
Was that when you were
supposed to meet Elizabeth?
No.
She said that she'd get here
in the afternoon.
She had a key.
- Did you leave the school at one?
- Yes, I did.
I went home.
I wanted to talk to my wife.
- Of course. Did you?
- No.
Inspector.
She was attacked in the bath.
She struggled a lot.
Dozens of bruises on her neck.
The killer used a towel,
so there are no finger prints.
She wasn't strangled, she drowned.
There are hairs under her nails,
they're not from the victim,
probably the killer's.
I've sent them to the lab.
- Was she raped?
- I don't think so.
We'll know more after the autopsy.
We can go.
- There he is!
- That's him!
Sorry, no comment. Let me through.
Get in.
- Were they having an affair?
- No comment.
- Here comes the colonel's car!
Give us a statement, inspector.
The police station, please.
You shouldn't have come colonel.
When can I see my niece?
- Tomorrow. It's not possible now.
- Have you arrested her killer?
Who? You mean Rosseni? No.
We can't be sure.
- I'm certain he's guilty!
Mr Bryant,
I offer my sincerest condolences,
as do my colleagues.
Thank you, but condolences
mean nothing right now.
I still haven't seen poor Janet's body,
they only care about the new murder.
The inspector's vanished.
I've been waiting for hours.
Colonel Seccles obviously
has more influence than me.
It's one o'clock. I have business
to deal with as well!
In that case, leave!
I don't need
to question you any more.
Why don't you question them?
Three deaths and they still don't see
there's a sex maniac at that school!
Wait till you read tomorrow's papers.
- What do you want?
- We need a sample of your hair.
Sorry colonel, but there's no point
in a confrontation between you
and professor Rosseni.
You have no proof.
- A married teacher seduced a minor,
that's proof enough for me.
- But not enough for a conviction.
Then make him confess!
I'm sure you know how.
You're upset colonel.
It's understandable. I'll have you
accompanied you to your car.
Thank you, but there's no need.
Inspector.
Where's Enrico? Can I see him?
- Not now. Please be patient.
- You're wasting your time.
Enrico didn't kill that girl.
He's no murderer or a sex maniac!
We have to be certain.
Excuse me, I have a lot to do.
I don't know about the relationship
between Miss Seccles and Rosseni,
or the other two girls.
No-one said there was more
than one relationship.
No? It seemed obvious to me.
I'm sure.
Do these green pins
mean anything to you?
She was a lovely girl.
There's no way she slept around.
If she had an affair with Enrico,
she must have loved him.
She was serious and sensitive.
How could someone
hate her enough to kill her?
As for Enrico,
I can't believe he did it.
It's completely inconceivable.
I never liked that Italian.
I knew there was something going on.
He's disgusting.
Have you seen this key before?
- Is this a game?
- It's one of the keys to the flat.
Rosseni says that his key
was stolen yesterday,
between 10:00 and 11:30
from the changing rooms.
You think I stole it?
Enrico is young. His wife can be harsh,
she has rigid principles.
It's not surprising
he needed some distraction.
You're a good psychologist.
Do you think Rosseni is...
drawn to young girls?
I'm no expert, but these days
a girl of 18 is hardly a child.
It's a shame, but true.
Regardless of morals...
why would he have killed her?
We all know what she saw.
She told us in the headmaster's office.
What did she know?
She was a witness to Hilda's death.
What did she actually say?
I formed an impression,
after much deliberation...
What did she say?
Hilda's killer wore long, black robes.
In other word, a priest.
What's this about a priest?
It's what she believed.
She had nightmares about it.
Seeing the murder again and again.
Then she remembered the priest.
- When did she say that?
She rang me one night.
She had another nightmare,
and remembered that detail.
- Which night?
Two nights ago.
When Janet Bryant was killed.
Please be patient.
Where's Grieg?
He was supposed to be here!
Go and get him at once!
This is the autopsy and the lab results.
The hairs from the fingernails
aren't Rosseni's,
they're dead hairs.
- Dead hairs?
As for the autopsy,
you won't believe this...
not only was there no rape,
the girl was still a virgin.
- Elizabeth was still a virgin?
- Exactly.
I'm sure that will restore
her reputation with the teachers.
Maybe.
You're needed for more questioning.
Come on, get dressed.
- Damn. I knew it would end like this.
Take a good look.
What was he: Catholic, protestant,
Jesuit, Dominican? Answer!
Enough! You call me a liar, now you want
to know what order he belonged to?
All priests wear black! Black!
You must have seen something!
Okay, alright...
Maybe he had a beard.
Get me Draper.
- Here you are inspector.
- Thank you.
The hairs found under the finger nails,
could they have come from a beard?
Yes, but only a fake beard.
The hairs are synthetic.
Okay, thanks.
Hold him a while longer.
Come on, take another look.
Father Webber. Father!
- Praise be to the Lord.
- Yes, of course.
Have you ever seen a priest
with a beard at the school?
Or perhaps at the church?
- I don't think so. Why?
- Never mind.
You can go now, and take him with you.
What a bunch of bastards!
I'll never find a taxi at this time.
To hell with priests!
Why did I have to see him?
And people say I'm too superstitious!
- God, there's another one!
Leave me alone!
Yesterday, your husband was late
for his appointment with Elizabeth,
because he wanted to talk to you,
but he didn't. Why not?
I didn't exactly encourage him.
I didn't want to know.
- No, you already knew.
You left before him, didn't you?
Where did you go?
- Why do you ask?
- Your husband didn't kill anyone.
He'll be released shortly.
- Can I go?
One last thing, Mrs Rosseni.
The girl, Elizabeth, was still a virgin.
This is for you, from Mr Leech.
So is this.
All your school clothes. Don't you want
to check? - Not now, thanks.
You can go.
What did you expect from
the headmaster, congratulations?
You're not suspected of killing her.
You're not even to blame for her death.
Take and shower and relax,
we can talk later.
We haven't talked for ages,
If we carry on like this,
we'll never speak again.
You spoke to Elizabeth
yesterday, in the courtyard.
I saw you with her.
I wanted to say something,
but I didn't have the courage.
I told her to study more at home.
We don't have to say much, Erta.
We know each other too well.
We've just grown apart a little.
- You want us to stay together?
I have to know who killed her.
You understand, don't you?
I want to know too.
I'll help in any way I can.
You've all heard that
Elizabeth Seccles died yesterday.
The headmaster wants classes
to go on as normal.
This experience has been
unpleasant enough as it is.
But we can talk about
it among ourselves a little.
Was Elizabeth killed by the same person
as Janet?
- In the same way? - My mum wouldn't let
me read the papers today.
- I read them. Is it true that
Mr Rosseni was arrested?
Wait, I've got some questions too.
- May I?
- Stand up.
Please excuse me.
I need to have a chat with
these young ladies.
Have any of you seen, in recent weeks...
A priest with a beard?
At school or in church... well?
Yes, in church. The new confessor.
- What do you mean 'new'?
- Another, not Father Webber
He only comes here now and then.
- How many times has he been?
- Two or three.
Did any of you confess
to this bearded priest?
That's enough girls.
Confession is a serious thing.
Who's spoken to the new priest? Come on!
- I did Miss.
- What did you say?
I'm sorry.
Did Hilda confess to this priest?
I don't know, but Janet did.
I remember, during Hilda's funeral.
We took communion.
Okay, I understand.
Thank you all. You too madam...
Goodbye.
- Weren't you friends with Hilda
and Janet? - Not really.
That's not true! You were like a gang.
You, Hilda, Janet and Helen too.
Mind your own business!
Girls! So what if they were friends?
Why try to hide it?
Why trying learn more. Don't you want
to know who killed Hilda and Janet?
Elizabeth was a good friend of Janet,
as you well know.
Only you can help the police, because
you knew these girls well.
Do you know who their friends
were out of school?
Which boys they spent time with?
You were right, Hilda, Janet, Brenda
and Helen were close friends.
- Did you find out anything?
- Not much.
Brenda's as cunning as a fox,
but I think Helen's a little scared.
- Scared? Why?
- I don't know.
I did discover one thing though.
Hilda and Janet were seeing older boys,
university students.
They were anything but innocent!
Sorry, that came out wrong.
I found out the name of one young man.
He lives on a houseboat on the Thames,
his name is Philip Sollivan.
- I'm a friend of Philip Sollivan.
- Fine, you can come in.
He'll be back in a minute,
he's changing films.
- Are you Philip Sollivan?
- Yes, what is it?
Do you have a minute?
I'm a teacher from St. Mary's school.
Don't worry, this is just between
you and me. No trouble.
- What do you want to know?
- Let's talk outside.
Not so fast!
I don't have long. Let's finish now,
or we'll run out of time.
Sorry. Let me finish this shoot.
Have a seat.
Come on baby, let's go to work.
Did you know Janet Bryant
and Hilda Ericson?
Sure, I met them
at university last year,
all my friends knew them as well.
They were two cool girls.
It's tragic, the way they died.
Cool in what way?
In that way. Sex, my friend.
- It was easy to get them into bed?
- Actually, no.
But everything else, yes.
Haven't you read the Kinsey report?
What do you know about
Brenda and Helen. You know them?
Of course I know them.
Brenda, Helen...
what was that other one called?
- Elizabeth.
Yeah, her. The one that
was killed two days ago.
Now I think about it...
she wasn't really part of that crowd.
- They were all students of mine.
They were like a gang,
weren't they?
Better believe it! They even slept
together, the little lesbians.
- What about with the boys?
- They never slept with any of us.
Not after what happened to Solange.
Okay, babe. We're done,
you can get dressed.
So, what do you want to know?
First of all, who's Solange?
Just a girl. It was just an example.
An example of what? Who is Solange,
what happened to her?
Nothing! Why should
anything have happened?
- Talk!
- What is this?
She was half French.
Very free, very cute.
She used to sleep around,
but I never had her. I swear.
It's the truth!
She was in the first year.
- Not in my school. - No.
- Where, then?
I don't know.
A girls' school somewhere.
I don't know where. That's all I know.
She disappeared. I never saw her again.
I'm coming honey.
Father Herbert takes confession here,
We priests have our little habits too.
Of course. Who uses that one?
I mean, couldn't Father...
- Herbert. - Perhaps Father Herbert
brought a colleague in to help.
Another priest?
- I never have.
I take confession
for all the girls personally,
I'm the only one, I'm sure of that.
- You must be Father Herbert.
Step forward please.
Do you always use this confessional?
You never change?
But if you're in there,
and the Father's at the pulpit,
couldn't that damned priest...
I'm sorry. Couldn't the bearded priest
have hidden himself in here?
Theoretically, that would be possible.
But I don't think that's what happened.
I suppose you can't tell me
what the girls said to you
over the past two weeks.
- No, I can't.
- I understand.
I need to speak to you.
Please don't judge Elizabeth harshly,
our friendship was platonic.
I wanted to ask about something else.
Would you look at that!
He's unbelievable.
It would be wrong
to cause a scene here.
There's something I need to know.
You had a friend called Solange, right?
- Never heard of her. Have you?
- Me neither.
Come here. If you keep talking
to those girls,
Newton's bound to believe
you're a sex maniac.
How are things with Erta?
She's an amazing woman. Without her...
Yes, Solange. She started college
last year. I don't know the surname.
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.
- Well? - That was the last one.
I've checked every college in London.
Sit down. Look...
It can't be her, she's still there.
This one's called Solange, but she's
still in secondary school.
That leaves one, Solange Beauregard.
She started college last year,
But she hasn't begun her second year.
It has to be her. Where does she live?
James Street. Don't go there now.
Please, I'm exhausted.
Good evening, Miss.
Good morning.
You should go to work,
I'll look for Solange.
Okay. 'Bye.
What's going on?
Forgive the intrusion,
I'm looking for the Beauregard family.
Beauregard? I don't know them.
They have a daughter, she's sixteen.
Her name is Solange.
Do you know where I could find them?
- I'm sorry.
We've only been renting here for a year.
- Do you know the owner?
- I only know the agents, Golden House.
Thank you.
- Hallo?
- Is that Professor Rosseni?
- Who's calling?
- It doesn't matter.
Consider me a friend. Of Italy.
- What do you want?
- Be quiet and listen.
Take a holiday. Go to Italy. If you
don't, your wife will disappear.
Son of a bitch.
Hallo, this is Golden House Estates.
Our offices are closed
until Monday morning at nine...
RUTH HOLDEN KNOWS EVERYTHING
SHE LIVES AT GERASDORF
- Sir!
- What is it?
You dropped this earlier,
when you picked up the post.
Mrs Holden!
Is anyone here?
Mrs Holden!
Who could have left you this message?
Probably one of the second year girls.
- Why you?
- I've no idea.
The girls should be
under surveillance.
We've taken care of that.
Have you heard? Poor old Ruth.
- Are you scared?
- Just a little.
Well I am. We should go to the police.
Idiot! Don't you dare betray us!
We decided to keep it a secret.
You swore an oath!
Okay! I won't say a thing,
I promise you.
Do you do gym as well, Mr Newton?
Yes! I mean no.
I was looking for a colleague.
I was looking for some of the girls.
Where are the second year students?
Of course. Actually, no. I must go now!
Girls, did either of you know
Ruth Holden?
No.
Why did you say no?
You're Brenda Pitcher, aren't you?
Please join us, Mrs Rosseni.
Why did you say
you didn't know Mrs Holden?
This morning, your mother said she was
with your family for 3 years.
You mean nanny! I'm sorry inspector,
I always called her 'nanny'.
I forgot her name was Ruth.
Of course I knew her.
>From the day I was born, in a way.
The police are fumbling
around in the dark,
while treating me like a child.
- Maybe they're right.
- If I'm a child, I'm a stubborn one.
Those girls know everything,
I'm sure of it.
They're 16, they have secret boyfriends,
there's jealousy, orgies,
lesbian relationships.
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.
I wouldn't be surprised
if they took drugs.
My God! The way that poor woman died.
Don't think about it.
She's the connection between
all the killings.
But why dress as a priest?
What if it really is a priest?
He hears their confessions,
he absolves them, then he kills them.
Come on, that's enough now.
On Monday, we'll carry on
looking for Solange,
You might as well relax until then.
Come here! Stop it!
Why do you do this?
Come back here! Stop!
Stop running, Solange.
- Who is it?
- Hallo? It's Philip.
What's wrong? Why doesn't
he call me himself? - I've got news...
Come to the fun fair tomorrow.
Around two.
You must come.
It's important for everyone.
If you don't, the police will find out
everything. He'll be there.
Here, and here.
Unmarked cars. Try not to look like
policemen in disguise.
Keep an eye on everyone,
but make it subtle, okay?
Understood?
The trap's set. Tomorrow, two o'clock.
Don't you remember me? I'm Brenda.
You disappeared. Come on!
Why didn't you stay in touch?
Where have you been?
- Inspector.
- Don't salute, you idiot!
We were friends, we could be again.
Excuse me Father, did you see
two girls pass by?
Yes, they went in that direction.
I turned round for two seconds.
When I looked back, they'd gone.
I saw the car drive off, the priest was
the only person in it.
They can't have gone far.
We've got roadblocks everywhere.
We're doing all that we can.
She was with a friend,
not someone from school though.
I'm sure of that.
Please try to think who that might be.
- Inspector Barth!
- Excuse me.
Mister Bascombe.
My daughter Solange isn't at home.
I went out. When I returned, she'd gone.
- Do you have a photo of her?
- Yes, certainly.
I thought you might need it.
Stay with him.
Sergeant Kramer! - Solange Beauregard
is Bascombe's daughter?
Yes. She's mentally ill. He keeps her
hidden away.
Not the sort of thing you make public.
- She wasn't ill last year. - I know.
It happened last summer.
The doctor said it was
infantile regression.
Why is her surname different?
She's his daughter from another
marriage, for God's sake!
Don't you have anything better to do?
Where the hell is Kramer?
Look at this. Is this the girl
who was with Brenda? - Yes.
As you can see,
the door's been forced open.
Where is your daughter's room?
They broke into here as well. Since her
illness, I've kept her indoors.
But now... - There's nothing more
we can do here,
Stay at home. If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.
We'll keep you company if you want.
No thank you. I'd rather be alone.
Fine. Call us if you need anything.
He managed to keep Solange hidden
from everyone except the killer,
who used her as bait to get Brenda.
But why?
Solange started college
last year, didn't she?
Yes, I told you.
Now where are you going?
Solange can't speak, but you can.
I want to know everything, do you hear?
Everything.
I knew that nanny was good
at that kind of thing.
We went to there together, by bicycle.
That's not all. I want details.
We arrived at Ruth Holden's house.
An argument began.
There was disagreement,
Elizabeth and Hilda were against it.
They didn't want her to go inside.
But we managed to convince her
to see Mrs Holden,
we told her she didn't have a choice.
What did you do to Solange?
- Hurry up.
- You won't hurt me, will you nanny?
If it hurts a bit, you've deserved it.
Girls, hold her still.
Keep her legs wide open.
Do what you do when you're having sex,
grit your teeth.
Are you sure about this?
- Mr Bryant please.
- He's not home.
- It's professor Rosseni,
please let me in. - You're positive?
I wouldn't be here otherwise.
Hilda wouldn't tell me anything.
She didn't mention you or the others.
But she betrayed herself in confession.
Janet told me nearly everything.
In church, and before I killed her.
Are you sure no-one removed
a book after...
I don't know. No-one's been
in here since then.
The Italian text book isn't here.
We have to call Barth.
Now it's your turn, Janet.
Your turn.
Look, the door's been repaired.
There's no-one in. He's probably out
looking for his daughter.
- You're wrong. - Without a warrant,
there's nothing I can do.
I don't have any proof,
not even a decent clue.
See! An Italian text book
from the second year.
Solange left after her first year!
Why is this here?
A similar book is missing
from Janet's house,
because it's here. How is that possible?
This is Barth, tell all patrols
to look out for...
Hallo? Inspector?
You're Solange, aren't you?
Where's your father?
They found you!
Thank God. Where have you been?
Where did you find her?
- She came back on her own.
I have a few questions for you,
if you don't mind.
You too.
The black robes. Barth!
Inspector Barth!
Stay here.
Come with me.
Over there! The priest's habit.
She's unconscious.
- Why?
- The girls formed a club,
a secret sect, with oaths of silence
and even a badge, a green needle.
They were going out with boys
whenever they liked,
and nobody knew a thing about it.
Solange got pregnant.
They kept it a secret and forced her
to have an abortion.
It resulted in trauma. Her father
put some of the pieces together.
By using the priest's habit,
he discovered the rest in confession
and set out to avenge her death.
All the girls involved had to die.
All of them.
Hilda, Janet, Ruth Holden and Brenda,
all condemned to death
for what they did to his daughter.
Elizabeth died because she saw him.
But it's still this poor soul who's
paying the price for everyone.
