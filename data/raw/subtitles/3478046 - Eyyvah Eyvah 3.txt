Bravo, Hüseyin!
Wicked!
- Osman Abi, isn't that kid goat done yet?
- Still cooking.
Drink up, drink up!
C'mon, cheers!
Hüseyin Abi!
What's up?
Müjgan Abla is in labor!
- What?
- Müjgan Abla is in labor!
Müjgan's in labor!
- It's early.
- Calm down, Hüseyin.
- Müjgan's in labor!
- Relax, I'll get you there.
Go, go, go!
Hüseyin, where are you going?
- To Ezine.
- Go, go, go!
- It's early.
- So be it.
It was due next week.
I wouldn't be at work
if I'd known.
Relax. It'll be healthy,
it'll be perfect.
Don't worry.
Trust me.
Hüseyin, stay with me.
You promised.
I'm here, beautiful.
I'm here, my love.
I'm here, don't worry.
OK, Müjgan. You're doing great.
Good job.
Remember,
breathe in, breathe out and push.
- C'mon now.
- OK.
What's going on, Hüseyin?
I did the breathing
and my heart started pounding.
- I have to go out.
- Hüseyin!
Doctor, can we switch
to a C-section?
She's in pain.
Why the need?
Müjgan is doing fine.
Keep pushing, c'mon.
Don't give the mom stress.
I need water.
Can I have some water?
Cold or normal, Hüseyin?
For heaven’s sake!
You're making her tense up.
What about giving her some support?
- C'mon, Müjgan. Push. Ignore him.
- What else am I supposed to do?
Stop butting in
then hiding under there.
You want me to grab the baby?
Do your job.
What about patient psychology?
I asked for water, not raki.
I'm having stress.
I'm all over the place.
Where's the support?
As a dad? As a husband?
What the hell?
I thought I'd give hera fright
to help her relax.
Idiot!
Out! Get out!
Am I supposed to deal with you
or deliver the baby?
Lift it up!
You get out!
It's your fault.
You came and she tensed up.
Out! Get another doctor.
Are there no other doctors
in this hospital?
Has it arrived?
Whee!
Six months later
Did you wake up?
Did you wake up?
You're a gem.
My little tiger.
My little Bayram.
Come here, c'mon.
You strapping young thing.
Look at you.
Pooh!
That stinks!
Did your mom
feed you meatballs, son?
Phew, c'mon.
C'mon now.
Don't cry.
Let Daddy turn on the TV for you.
It's OK when I put you down.
You know what?
Where's that sardine, huh?
Look, I turned on the TV for you.
I turned on the TV for you, see?
Oof!
Bayram Berk,
you're a true miracle.
How can you eat 2 grams
and make 3 kilos?
Good grief!
Allah allah be. Dur sakin dur.
Look, it's Firuzan Abla.
I get exhausted performing.
Everything must be perfect.
But guys,
now really isn't a good time.
- Thanks.
- She got to be a star.
You must always be prepared.
Even out shopping!
But at home
I wanna leave all that behind.
My home looks like this.
Rızgara.
A retreat from the brouhaha.
Rızgara awaits you too.
Rızgara Homes
Await Occupants
Look at the place.
It would scare a dog.
Shame on you! Is this what I get
for the commercial?
Business is bad.
Finally I get a commercial...
And it's a waste of time.
Firuzan, our deal with the guys
was for flats.
Could a commercial
get you a flat in Istanbul?
Is this Istanbul, Yaşar?
It's near enough.
The metro's coming.
Spaniard,
get the guy out of my hair.
Or I'll tear his hair out.
Sorry, Yaşar.
I'm done with you. It's over.
Screw you!
- You see?
- Firuzan, please. Calm down.
The metro's coming.
Coming where?
So is the Black Sea.
Great!
What more could I ask for?
Yes, Hüseyin?
Get to be a star
and you forget us.
Hüseyin, can I call back later?
OK, sure.
Sure, Abla.
Have a nice day.
I can't talk now,
my nerves are shot.
Hüseyin, if only it was a wedding.
When it's a club
I worry about you all night.
Honey, it's work.
And work is money.
Müjgan. Let me take a peek
before going.
No chance, Hüseyin.
I just got him off to sleep.
C'mon, please.
I never stop thinking about him.
Just a peek.
OK, but be quiet.
Sure.
- He's just like me.
- Shh!
Oh no!
Great, there you go.
What now?
How could I help it?
Hey, Bayram Berk?
- I mean, Hüseyin.
- Hey, Bayram Berk?
Bravo, Hüseyin.
I mean, bravo.
Did you wake up?
Bayram,
what should Daddy get you?
What should Daddy get you?
What should Daddy get you
from the club, huh?
Go, Hüseyin.
He'll be up all night.
Müjgan, let me have a kiss
now he's awake.
OK, OK, OK.
I know what I'm in for.
Why are women so cranky
after giving birth?
What was a kiss gonna do?
He was awake anyway.
Damn you!
Deniz!
Oh my God!
You die first, then me.
Don't hide behind him.
- He's talking to you.
- Don't abandon me.
Hey, calm down, friend.
Quiet!
Come out
or I'll shoot the guy.
- Do as he says.
- No, please!
Friend, what's up?
See that woman? I gave her everything
and still she dumped me.
Now she's dancing for joy
because I'm a wreck.
Shame on her.
But you can talk about it.
Huh?
It won't work with guns.
Huh? What's your name?
- Esat.
- What do you do?
- Sell water.
- Great! A nice, clean job.
- What did you say?
- He's lying.
He cheated on me
with my hairdresser.
So damn what?!
I'm not some agony aunt.
Just talk and make up.
Talk to each other.
And lower that gun.
We have families.
You go drinking and swagger in here.
Hey, where are you from?
Not from around here.
- Çan. So what?
- Same as our Kamil.
- Which Kamil?
- Armless Kamil.
That's Circumciser Kamil.
Erkan, you're mixing them up.
We don't have a Circumciser Kamil.
Do you mean Ferruh?
Ha, Ferruh.
Yes, Ferruh.
How's he doing? Is he OK?
Not bad. He's old now, but OK.
Still chopping.
- He's such a scream, huh?
- Yes, he has this goat story.
Just hear it.
It's hilarious.
See? We're friends.
So drop the gun, avoid any accidents.
Let's sit fora decent chat.
Want a drink?
Well, OK.
Damn you, Süleyman!
Damn your heroics!
You broke my clarinet.
I got him calm. Why hit him?
- My clarinet!
- Easy, Hüseyin.
Good grief.
Still, let's be thankful.
Astray bullet
could've blighted our family.
I haven't been home yet.
The cops kept us all night.
And they shut the club.
My job's gone.
My clarinet too.
Look, it's totally kaput.
How can I get a new one?
Go home and get some rest.
We'll handle it.
Like how, Dad?
For goodness sake!
You put every cent into this place.
It's opening any day.
Yes.
Your grandad's all fired up.
We'll see.
God help us.
Amen.
God give you sense, Halim!
Is a camel gonna save us?
I said don't, you old boozer.
Damn you!
Keep your nose out, hag.
As if I have money!
Well, if you drink
and gamble all winter.
It's a sin! He'll slaughter you
in the next life.
Fine if he catches me.
Anything you frown on is a sin.
Who butchers tiny kid goats
and stuffs rice up their asses?
That's different.
Look at the beast!
Morning, Hüseyin.
Morning.
C'mon now. C'mon.
Dad, what's going on?
Grandad's making camel sausage.
He says it'll sell.
Huh?
C'mon.
What can I do?
We're out of money.
Brown bread again, Müjgan?
It's healthy, Hüseyin.
I've had it with diets!
I'm fading away.
Is that so bad?
The weight's falling off.
No this, no that.
Will it never end?
I'm like a demented fox.
I dream about pastries.
I know, honey.
But just lose a tiny bit more.
- It's easy now. You're almost done.
- What's easy?
9 months of your cravings
and life was hell.
You wanted watermelon in midwinter.
Think of me.
I was born with cravings.
It's how I am.
- I've had cravings for 35 years.
- Don't do it then!
- You'll be a sofa again in 2 weeks.
- A sofa?
That's respect for a husband!
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I know you're thinking of me,
but I need sympathy.
No work, no clarinet.
What do we do?
Look.
I have you,
you have me.
- Huh? We have the baby.
- Thank goodness.
We'll figure something out.
Don't worry.
Let's hope, honey.
What's that lipstick?
From the dancer.
She grabbed me from behind.
She grabbed you.
Wait till I grab you!
I'm going to work.
For goodness sake.
That baby has to grow up fast.
He made her so cranky.
- Dead.
- Huh?
The shaft's cracked inside.
Toss it. It's trash.
- No, really?
- Really.
Hey, Cezmi. Give him a hand.
Got any good clarinets?
Here.
- Whose was this?
- Porky Ahmet's in his time.
Porky Ahmet?
Who was he?
- From Biga. Died of a heart attack.
- Ha.
The Sabancis' Süleyman,
he had a heart attack too.
- So did our Şükrü, the violinist.
- Must be an epidemic.
Nice clarinet.
What do you want for it?
- 3000.
- Huh?
He wants 3000 lira.
How can I pay 3000 lira
for a clarinet?
His daughter ran off,
that's why he wants 3000.
He needs the money.
Erkan. Are you gonna shut up?
Don't make me
regret bringing you.
Hüseyin.
Borrow your dad's sax.
Play that.
Sax? No, c'mon.
Forget business being bad.
So long as we have love, baby.
You bet we do, honey.
Our sommelier suggests this wine
for your menu choice.
Really?
Which one is that?
Ha. Your sommelier chose this?
1962. A vintage year.
You mean history.
Excuse me?
I mean the wine's old.
OK, honey.
Let's go for it.
No, baby. Umm...
He's saying 62.
That's nearly my sister's age.
It's like she's right here.
I can't take it.
Umm, sorry.
Can we return to the present?
Hey, wait.
- Isn't he an actor at that table?
- Which one?
The guy with the beard.
He's on TV.
Ha. He's in that series
'Under the Pine Trees'.
He's an actor.
Hey, it's money.
C'mon, get over there.
Good evening.
- Hello. Bon appétit.
- Good evening.
- Welcome to our town.
- Thanks.
We know you from TV of course.
We watch all the time.
Welcome.
Shall we play something?
Efsun?
You say.
What should they play?
Some Halil Sezai?
Sure. Who's he?
The guitarist.
You know, that quiet guy.
With the forelock.
We can do him, but it won't sound good
with these instruments.
- How about a classic?
- Sure, OK.
- Let's say "Who's Tired of Loving".
- Ah, nice.
Wait a second.
I wanna take a picture of our hands.
Wait.
Wait, I'll show you.
Ah, it's great.
- Let's see.
- Wait, let me take another.
- It's great, look.
- Great.
How good is that.
We're so good together.
Suppose we get married?
Was that a bit forward?
I dunno,
we just get along so well.
I suddenly got all, you know.
I'm a romantic, it's the Cancer thing.
- Firuzan?
- OK, maybe you don't want to.
Marriage is something else.
I'd understand.
Firuzan, I'm married.
Well, I was married.
In Spain.
What?
Yes.
Wait a second.
ARE married or WERE married?
I'm working on ending it.
You're working on it.
Why don't I know about this?
Great.
So you're working on it.
How do you mean?
It's like some hobby?
My lover works on leaving his wife
during his free time.
That's beyond cute!
So sweet!
Seriously.
Shame on you, Spaniard!
Everyone's staring, Firuzan.
Let them!
You're a beast, you know?
A savage.
You sly ass, Spaniard.
- Firuzan?
- Don't come after me!
- Argh! A cat! Can, a cat!
- C'mon, Efsun. It's gone.
- I saw more damn cats than people here.
Argh, the cat! The cat, Can!
Efsun!
God!
- What did you do, dammit?
- What did I do?
- Why did you wind up the cat?
- I just went 'zzzt'.
- Why?
- What else do you say to a cat?
Hello? I went 'zzzt'
to get the cat away from your wife.
Asshole, I'll...
Don't come back again.
I say nothing to the clarinet,
then it's a sax. Beat it!
So we can't make a few cents?
For goodness sake.
SPANIARD
Homes she sells are in court,
intended turns out to be wed
Oh my God!
You are such a cutie.
Just look at you!
- Müjgan, give him here.
- C'mon, over to Grandad.
Hey, Mr Cutie.
You are so cute.
Welcome, Father.
Son-in-law, welcome.
Come over.
Did you get here OK?
No problem.
Come on over.
Hi, Dad.
How are you?
Fine thanks.
- Welcome, Mother.
- Thanks, dear.
- You think he's grown?
- Boy, has he grown!
Boy, he's got so big.
Well, baby Berk means more expenses.
How's the music going, son-in-law?
- Fine, Father. We manage.
- Good.
Edremit?
Did you just call the baby Berk?
Yes. We named my grandson Berk,
remember?
Come off it!
We named him Bayram.
Berk was my late father's name.
It's very fitting.
- Your father was Berk?
- Yes. Berk Pasha.
He could fell a stallion
in a single blow.
My grandad was a cattle herder.
But what a herdsman!
One winter the roads were under snow.
Villagers had no food.
My grandad fed his herd
to all the villagers.
He was a good man,
Grandad Bayram.
I say Bayram's the best name for him.
Enough!
Let his parents decide.
Hüseyin?
We call him Bayram Berk.
But on my own I just use Bayram.
OK, it's settled.
Register him as Bayram Berk.
People can use what they like.
Bayram Berk Badem.
What the hell is that?
Some cologne brand?
Edremit!
Enough! Please!
Don't spoil the day.
Welcome, Kadriye.
Hello.
I came soon as I heard.
It's too bad.
- What's up?
- Here, it's in the paper.
There's a story on Firuzan Abla.
She means that.
No, I don't mean that.
The supplement.
The supplement?
Hand it over, let me see.
What's all this about?
MAN RAIDS BAR FOR LOVER
Give it here, let's see.
Son-in-law.
So business is good, huh?
No let-up on the action.
Great!
What the hell is this?
Enough!
Quiet. They'll hear, Edremit.
- Let them!
- Quiet.
It's your fault.
You let the girl marry a musician.
Now my grandson's future
is in the hands of some floozy!
What a joke!
He says he'll play sax instead.
What if that breaks?
We'll help buy him a pipe.
He'll carry on his antics
till Bayram Berk's grown up.
Enough!
It'll be OK, dear.
They're opening a restaurant.
His father and grandfather
are sure to help out, Edremit.
No chance! They're crazy.
It's clear as hell.
They killed the camel
to make sausage.
The clarinet's gone too.
So what now?
Look here, Necla.
I have my feet on the ground.
It's high time
we got that boy a proper job.
Good evening.
Father's right, Mother.
I trusted my clarinet,
but I guess that was wrong.
And now there's the baby.
I'll do anything for my family.
It's for you to decide.
Bravo.
That's my son-in-law!
Bravo.
Like I said, chief.
He'll start on contract.
Hopefully it'll work out
and we can make him permanent.
Thanks, Mayor.
Hüseyin won't let you down.
Right, Hüseyin?
- Sure.
- Bravo.
Treat everyone equally.
No favors, no turning a blind eye.
- Geyikli must have justice.
- Sure.
What's this trash here?
It's not mine.
I didn't put it there.
Does it matter
whose damn trash it is?
What's the harm
in picking it up?
For God's sake!
Unbelievable!
Damn you!
Clean the place up.
I wanna see no more trash.
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam.
Are they fresh?
I make them myself.
Here.
- How much are they?
- Nothing. Enjoy.
Did you pay the charge
to set up here?
No.
Then you have to.
But I don't make 5 cents here!
Someone complained about you.
Now get packing.
You can come back when I'm gone.
- No.
- No?
No. Why should I?
It's my busiest time.
Don't give me your busiest time!
What a bighead!
Forget being nice.
Someone complained.
You wanna incriminate me
my first day?
You ate half my mussels.
What's left to pack up?
That was your fault.
You egged me on.
You kept ramming them down my throat.
I'll throw the rest to the cats.
Pack up!
You saw that, right?
He scoffs my mussels,
then kicks me out.
You're all witnesses.
God sees everything.
Say something, brothers in faith!
I have 4 kids.
What are they gonna eat?
Take the money.
Why are you bothering people?
- Hats! Fedoras!
- Hat-man, come here!
Hey, this isn't enough!
Don't run away!
Come here! Come here!
What's going on?
Come here!
Come here!
- What's going on?
- Come here!
I'll chop off your head
if I catch you!
It's that jerk again.
Man, not you again!
Welcome. What are you up to?
How's the holiday? Hello.
Sorry, we crashed.
All because of those hat-men.
They're parasites here.
Stay away from here.
See? It bothers people.
If you need anything,
I'm here.
Come here.
Come here.
This is an announcement
from Geyikli Town Hall.
The fish market is selling sardines
for 7.5 lira a kilo.
For the public's attention.
Who cares about sardines?
I'm dead.
This job isn't for me.
I'm a musician, dammit.
They're exploiting me.
Give me drums, anything but this job.
But it's my fault.
It's my stupid fault.
I can't be a bad person.
The devil says
face the father-in-law.
Say, father-in-law!
Come here, father-in-law.
Say, is it you
who fed us up to now?
Say, stop meddling.
What's the big deal?
That's not Hüseyin.
Well, Hüseyin.
The past comes back...
To bite you in the butt.
Sardines at the fish market.
As if I give a rat's ass.
Shame on you.
That's all I have to say.
Shame on you.
Let's call it first-day stress.
I was talking to myself.
Hear that, Necla?
A certified crackpot.
Talks to himself.
So keep it to yourself!
It's only human, love.
These things happen.
I'm sorry.
Keep your apology for the mayor.
Let's see if he accepts it.
You ruined my reputation!
I'll get that.
Yes?
Who are you?
Hüseyin.
Firuzan Abla?
What are you doing?
I haven't even started yet.
Spaniard was better than Fatih, huh?
No, it's suicide.
I'm serious.
It's over and I'm back where I was
when it started.
- It's total suicide.
- But hang on, nothing's over yet.
How can you say that?
Why didn't you tell me
he was married?
I would have if I'd known.
You think he just married on paper
to be able to live there?
That's how it works.
You say, this is my husband,
let him come here.
And in Europe
they give you residency.
Stop babbling
like some embassy official.
I know all that.
Surprise, surprise,
Spaniard is married in Spain.
Is that why
you called him Spaniard?
No way! He had a run-in
with a sacrificial bull as a kid.
Sure.
His jersey caught on the bull's horns.
The bull tossed him about like a rag.
We took him for dead.
But Spaniard bounced around
like a matador and saved himself.
He's been Spaniard ever since.
Just a nickname, no big deal.
My poor Spaniard! He's a softie.
It must've hurt so badly. Sweetheart!
My sweetheart!
- For goodness sake!
- Damn you, Spaniard.
How could you do this to me?
Firuzan Abla! Enough, please!
Seriously, I'm not happy you came.
- Call him. Say you're here.
- No!
I'm not calling him, Hüseyin!
He should've told me everything.
We shared everything.
He should've told me.
Ah, I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe it was a gamble
and I knew I'd lose everything.
Hüseyin?
Can I stay with you a while?
Just a few days?
The house is yours.
Stay as long as you like.
- Thanks.
- No one will bother you here.
You can clear your head.
My favorite big sister's here!
Drink, c'mon! Enough tears.
Ah, you!
He's just like Hüseyin.
Look at you, you're gorgeous.
What a cutie!
- Müjgan, let me hold him fora bit.
- Sure, Firuzan Abla.
Come here. Oh my God!
He's the size of a chickpea!
Ah, you're gorgeous!
- A miracle of life, isn't he, Firuzan?
- An absolute miracle.
Well, coming from
a father like Hüseyin.
- Edremit!
- Just kidding.
You cutie!
You're so sweet.
A little child came home one day
and found the house was empty
Here, Müjgan.
Sorry, my nerves are shot.
We know.
It'll all pass.
Now let's talk about nicer things.
OK, I'd like to do a portrait of you.
God willing.
Good morning.
What is that, bumfluff?
What's with the outfit?
Müjgan, is this some police fantasy?
So you haven't heard.
Hüseyin now works
for the municipality.
No, you're kidding.
Come in!
Good morning, Mayor.
- I came to apologi...
- No, Hüseyin. Sorry.
- Official duties aren't for you.
- But if you give me a chance...
No, Hüseyin, sorry.
The chief won't be happy...
But I've had too many complaints.
OK, return your uniform.
Good luck to you.
Take up your pipe again.
Thanks.
Hüseyin!
Spaniard!
What?
- Did you tell him I was here?
- No.
- He guessed when I went quiet.
- Bravo, bumfluff!
Very smart.
That's how I'll keep my secrets
from now on.
You discovered a great new game show.
Guess What Turkey.
Sell it to Acun.
But Abla, the man's dying of grief.
His eyes are all sunken.
Good!
Let me ask him here
to explain himself.
No way!
No way!
He must've told you, so you tell me.
I don't wanna see his face.
The woman's coming.
She's on her way.
She's happy to divorce.
He says he was gonna tell you.
You surprised him...
By suddenly raising it,
so he was made to look like a liar.
Like I said,
their marriage was a formality.
All Spaniard wants
is to introduce you to her.
What?
Hang on, did I hear right?
Yes.
The guesthouse is just there.
We'll go for coffee there tomorrow.
If all goes well...
We'll ask Spaniard's wife
for his hand, huh?
Guess that's how it looks, huh?
I'm the envoy.
To hell with your envoy thing!
Are you out of your mind?
- Get out!
- Get out where?
OK, I'll leave.
I'm going to Istanbul.
- Got it?
- Don't be crazy!
Firuzan.
Mercedes, I told Firuzan everything.
Plus...
Ola!
I specially wanted to see you
because I'm furious.
- Yes. I'm straight up furious.
- Mercedes.
But it's true!
I'm furious at him
for not telling you.
- OK...
- But you just can't do that to a woman.
You put me through hell too.
My journey took 12 hours.
I had to fly economy.
Those seats are made for Armani butts.
My legs got crushed.
I had a child wailing and drooling
down my neck. His mom had sleep apnea.
Whenever the child went to sleep
she'd wake him up with a loud snort...
And he'd start crying. Don't sleep
if you have that problem, right?
My late uncle had it.
He looked dead when he was asleep.
Like this.
Then he'd suddenly jerk awake
with this huge snort. Yes.
- Aren't you talking nightmares?
- No, it's sleep apnea.
Yes.
Anyway.
He's dragged you all the way here
for nothing.
Would it be different
if he'd told me before?
Would we be closer?
Or would we have flown apart
all the sooner? We can't know.
Spaniard dreamed of a break-up song
and he's playing it now.
And I'm afraid we,
well I...
Am just listening.
C'mon now, sweetie.
Don't be unfair on yourself.
You found a good catch.
Ismail is lazy.
But he's good.
Sorry, when you say 'good'?
- Umm, where's the bathroom here?
- Shh, sit down!
If he weren't lazy,
he'd wouldn't be back in Turkey.
Our thing was just an agreement.
Lots of people do it.
Ismail wanted to live in Barcelona
so I helped him.
- You live in Barcelona?
- Si.
- You go to the matches?
- No.
I apologize to you both.
Firuzan?
I'm sorry.
Ismail?
C'mon, take us to the place
that does those vine-leaves you love.
Ah Firuzan, their vine-leaves!
Tiny things, the size of my finger.
Vine-leaves?
You like vine-leaves?
Ha! Vine-leaves.
If you like vine-leaves...
My gran makes
the best vine-leaves around here.
Spaniard, take the ladies to our place
for my gran's vine-leaves.
Let's see how you rate them.
I swear nothing beats them.
You can make friends.
And it's a way to welcome our guest.
Welcome, Mercedes.
Nice to meet you.
OK then.
Abla, my cell phone is on.
Enjoy the vine-leaves.
All right, OK. All right.
We struck lucky, Sabri.
If we make the most of this
nothing can stop Geyikli.
- The ministry called.
- What's up, Mayor?
Great things! The olive festival
is going international this year.
The Greek island Lesbos
is pitching in.
Artists from Greece, the Lesbos mayor,
ministers, priests, they're all coming.
An opportunity lands at our feet!
But this time we need
a big name at the festival.
But how do we do that, Mayor?
We don't.
The organizer will handle it.
The man's on his way. I found
a top-notch organizer. International.
Organizer.
How's that?
We're in international waters.
They won't even find your body.
Shall I dump you?
Look, Captain.
You're out of order.
God's my witness, a debt's a debt.
I'll pay it back, I swear.
- My assistant can't swim.
- Zip it!
- When are you gonna pay?
- In a week. Give me a week.
You promised all month.
What's different now?
Work.
I got work, Captain.
From umm, from Geyikli.
Please, let us go!
Thanks. Thanks.
You screw the captain, huh?
We'll see who screws who.
You have a week.
Find the money and bring it.
He's staying.
Me?
Collateral.
Here come the blue fish.
- Here you go.
- They smell delicious.
- Mercedes?
- Huh?
Pardon me asking, but is Mercedes
your original name or a nickname?
My real name's Melahat,
but my friends in Spain use Mercedes.
Halil Dede, it's a nickname.
Mercedes is really a Spanish name.
It's also a car brand.
- Sorry?
- Like a Murat 124, Dede.
Huh. Well I'll be damned!
Mercedes dear,
you sure like your food.
- Aren't you afraid of gaining weight?
- No, sweetie.
Diets are a new fashion.
Women starve themselves
in the name of beauty.
They go blonde, get fake teeth
and all end up looking the same.
But it's true.
I have my own teeth, my original hair
and get on with enjoying life.
Great.
Come in.
Good day to you.
I brought back my uniform, Mayor.
But maybe we could have a word?
- Wait over there.
- OK.
Mr. Halit, we can't pay
this kind of money.
Mr. Çetin,
you get what you pay for.
I'm bringing an entire team.
We'll cover the town in posters.
Let it be a great event.
That's always my aim.
God willing,
this will be my 450th event.
I speak from experience.
Don't get me wrong, Mayor,
but it isn't easy being Halit Akan.
Far from it.
Starting out, I had one slogan.
And that was...
No town will go without entertainment.
Our towns will be revived.
Who's this Popstar Ceren?
Your voice hits the walls
I am scorched by scars
One morning his bullet hits me
Hits and hurls me into the air
Her most popular song.
Remember?
No, I don't, you see?
She's down as 3000 lira. Glory be!
Çetin Abi, the guys you know
start from 15,000.
Sorry, I was familiar using 'Abi'.
If it bothers you...
No, go ahead.
Yes. Çetin Abi,
those are the prices.
Six instruments, plus artists.
Plus fixtures included.
We also have a core team of dancers
from Fire of Anatolia.
Add them on and our festival
will be a true festival.
Come in!
Ha! And here's Mr. Can,
our theatre director.
You'll know him from television.
Come in, Can Hodja. Have a seat.
Hello, Mayor.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
So you're the theatre man?
Yes.
I'll be doing it with Troy.
OK, decision time, Çetin Abi.
Oof, 10,000, 15,000. Add the play
and the Greeks. We're talking 30,000.
What should I do?
None of it.
Don't do any of it.
I'll bring Firuzan to that festival.
I'll get an awesome band together.
I'll do it for half the money.
Who are you, friend?
Çetin Abi?
Hüseyin.
No, well.
Firuzan is one of our singers too.
But numbers? The guy's out to lunch.
You can't do it for less than 20 or 30.
You can. I'll get Firuzan, Mayor.
On one condition: Get me a clarinet.
I'll do it.
20, 30, 40.
What kind of money is that?
It's all cock and bull.
Yes. This core group, that band,
posters all over town.
We're a town of 1500.
Posters are a waste of money.
We can shout.
Everyone will hear.
Who needs posters?
You did what?
- I fixed you a job.
- Are you my manager?
I'm in a living hell here
and you do that without asking.
My loss is your gain, huh?
C'mon, Firuzan Abla.
It'll be a morale boost.
Artists come to themselves on stage.
Plus I'll get a clarinet.
Ha, so it's about that, bumfluff.
- You fix me work to wangle a clarinet.
- Not exactly.
Look, I'm all fireworks inside.
Forget festivals.
Go buy a clarinet and I'll pay.
Don't be like that.
I could never take money from you.
- But you sell me.
- God forbid! How could you?
That was so beneath you!
Look, Firuzan Abla.
Let these poor folk here
see you sing live.
They're all crazy for you.
You went on TV and sang "Beans".
Everyone here was in tears.
We're proud of you.
You're Firuzan of Çanakkale to us.
You became a symbol here.
And there are Greeks coming.
The press will be here.
It's a chance to snap out of it.
Geyikli is in love with you.
Well, yes.
When the song became a hit
they became fans, I guess.
You bet they did.
I don't know, Hüseyin.
There's make-up, costumes,
the band...
- Don't drag me into work mode now.
- I'll handle it all. There's money too.
How much?
A small amount.
So, all the best to us.
All the best to you.
I love it.
Look at Daddy.
Daddy's making music, look.
Son-in-law.
You got your clarinet.
Landed on your feet again, huh?
- Please, this way.
- After you.
May God keep us happy!
Amen.
Ms. Firuzan.
I'd like to thank you
for your generous gesture...
In front of
all our friends and guests.
Don't mention it, Mr. Mayor.
It's nothing.
Being the Jennifer Lopez of Geyikli
I'll eat nuts since there's no money.
I got it, I got the rhyme.
How's that? Hüseyin?
C'mon then. All the best
to the restaurant and our festival.
We say welcome to our restaurant
and welcome to Firuzan and Mercedes.
C'mon then.
Help yourselves!
Hey, what's that?
It looks great. Bravo!
Hmm, muy bien.
Ha, bien.
See? She "biens" this too.
You're amazing, Mercedes.
Everything's bienvenu with you.
- Firuzan, please.
- What? She doesn't get it anyway.
Bon appétit, Mayor.
- My respects, Ms. Firuzan.
- Hi.
Welcome, Halit.
Ms. Firuzan, maybe you remember.
We were both at the Karaburun festival.
Oh, really?
Maybe, but I can't place you.
Sorry.
The team's coming tomorrow.
- As discussed.
- How come he knows you?
- But the Greeks are acting up.
- He's lying.
They now say
we should pay board and lodging.
You know our budget.
It means extra money.
A friend of mine has a camp hotel
in Gürpınar.
I could put the team there
for 150 lira per person.
- But then food would be extra.
- No chance!
No! We're already over-budget.
And food on top?
Mayor?
Irfan Abi has that hotel in Odunluk.
Let's put the guests there.
Guests are king.
And we'd keep the money.
Bravo, Hüseyin!
Good thinking.
- Irfan's one of us.
- Yes.
Everyone should do their bit.
We must make sacrifices for our town.
Ms. Firuzan is doing her bit,
so we'll be catering sponsors.
What?
Great! The restaurant's all set,
the beds are ready.
All we need now is the guests!
Don't let it get cold now.
Right.
Spaniard, carve for 12 people.
Oof, Ali Rıza.
What gave you
this sponsorship idea?
How are we gonna feed
so many people?
A gesture was called for,
Halit Abi.
There's plenty of fish here, right?
Serve fish and be done with it.
Good idea.
I'm a crack fisherman.
With the harpoon I had in my youth
I kept the whole village fed.
Why the forest
if we're going fishing?
Just follow me, Ali Rıza!
Roll up your trousers!
If there's fish to catch
I'll catch them.
Good old Edremit.
Still made of steel.
We can't do that,
it's a sin.
We aren't selling the fish.
What are the guests gonna eat?
Think of that
next time you offer to be sponsor.
Scoop the fish with that net
when they come to the surface.
OK, in the name of God!
What's that? A dolphin?
Run, Ali Rıza! Run!
You got off lightly.
Dad!
Can you hear me now?
- Only just.
- Only just.
It's OK, Müjgan.
There's no permanent damage.
Well, who were these guys
with the dynamite?
Father!
Did you see who it was?
Did you see them?
Yes. From up in the air.
There were two of them.
One fat, one short.
But their faces escape me.
One was short.
Who on earth were they?
Edremit.
Good, isn't it?
Very good.
I made it from camel hide.
Screw my hands, my feet
and all 5 fingers!
Lose in love, lose at games.
Talk about luck.
Hüseyin, you'll wake the baby.
I got him used to the clarinet.
The sound put him right to sleep.
He'll be a clarinetist.
Come here.
Forget pacifiers,
he wants a clarinet.
I missed you.
So did I.
We never see each other.
No.
What are you doing, Hüseyin?
In front of the baby?
With people outside? Behave!
I need some air.
Go on then.
If he had no shame...
C'mon, baby.
- My God, I got the joker!
- The joker?
Si, dear. Si!
This hand calls fora song.
Here!
Single or double, the joker's mine
And you're in trouble
Oh no!
Morning, Irfan Abi.
Morning, Hüseyin.
Morning, Mayor.
Well, Irfan,
the guests arrive today.
Today?
How many?
Have you been drinking?
No.
I told you 10 people were coming.
And a priest.
Wasn't that next week?
OK, Mayor.
I'll get onto that guesthouse.
We have folk dancers too.
I hope they have room.
Don't get onto anything.
Let's save the money.
Mayor, we'll share
the other guests among us.
The priest can stay with me.
Is that them there?
Look at the flags.
Right, it's them.
You're staying with us.
You're staying with us.
12TH INTERNATIONAL
GEYİKLİ CULTURE & OLIVE FESTIVAL
What's that smell, Helena?
And that music?
What's that whiff of seduction
in the air?
Me, Pan.
Nature's shepherd.
Hear my flute, mortal.
Breathe my smell.
Is your wish for an ordinary life
or a life of love?
I must die for love if that's my fate.
I accept the finest death from Hades.
Hades will show you the finest death!
Kill us here and relax.
We learnt the play backwards
baking out here.
Artists are waiting
and you laze in the shade like buffalo.
Cut, cut!
What's this bull about artists?
Aren't we artists?
- Failed policeman!
- What did you say?
Hang on, let me take over here.
You can't just look down on us.
We're artists too.
Besides, the public is judge.
You can't act like we don't exist.
We've been waiting hours for our slot.
I have sunstroke.
You know, in that TV series
when your cousin killed your wife...
I cried for days on end.
You just lost a fan, Mister.
God!
Can, what's going on?
What kind of place is this?
Drop the hand gestures!
You're talking to an artist.
This place was fine
when you gorged on calamari, huh?
Hang on, wait.
Just let it go, OK?
Ms. Firuzan, look.
We're all in the same boat.
Besides...
I'm a fan of yours too.
Thanks. Even if you aren't a fan,
that's the right approach.
No really, I'm crazy about you.
Thank you.
I'm all embarrassed now.
Yes, like you said,
I'm in the boat too. Yes.
So I say let's be critical,
let's help each other.
- So can I make a criticism?
- Sure, go ahead.
Honey, what was your last line?
Something about love?
- I must die for love if that's my fate.
- Ha, that's it. Exactly.
Sezen Aksu has that song Die for Love.
Suppose I came on singing that?
Just like that, you know?
It would be a nice touch.
My entrance would be a nice surprise.
This is my inner voice speaking.
As you well know,
the inner voice is important on stage.
That's why I'm speaking up.
It'll be umm, great.
Sorry,
will your series continue next year?
OK, this is for the theater guys
and this for the Greeks. Sign here.
Mr. Halit.
Thank you.
Çetin Abi,
you're sure about Firuzan, huh?
Personally, I'd rule out Hüseyin.
Experience tells me there'll be grief.
It's done, so let's hope for the best.
Anyway we like him.
What the hell is this?
The town key.
I said a symbolic key.
You made an anchor.
Symbolic, my ass!
It's for the minister.
If he drops it
his foot's broken.
Hüseyin Abi.
Müjgan Abla wants you.
OK.
Make a smaller one.
Go!
I'm gonna lose it.
Does no one in Geyikli get what I say?
I asked for traditional costumes.
How can I dress the band in these?
This is fabric for grannies.
All flash and fancy. I mean, please!
Make them yourself then.
I haven't slept for24 hours.
You're so rude!
He's so rude.
Where did you find him?
But it's true!
Hüseyin. Hüseyin...
Finishing these costumes
has done us in.
Just go with it this time, honey.
Look, Mersedes is tired out.
She's crazy!
Sorry, Abla.
I'm stressed out.
As the day gets closer
I get more uptight.
They're good actually.
They can wear them. Me too.
- Mum, where's Bayram Berk?
- Out with Firuzan Abla.
How's it going, Mr. Bayram?
You like it here?
Shall we sit at that table?
C'mon, let's sit down.
You went quiet.
Does that mean you like it?
Where have we come, huh?
Where are we?
Where have we come, huh?
Did we come for a walk?
Are we gonna have coffee, huh?
My little chickpea!
Look at that cute face.
Eyüp, you'll have to excuse me.
I have family to worry about.
To hell with you all.
I've had it.
Eyüp?
What's up?
No sound from you.
No, c'mon.
I have a bit with me anyway.
It's 2 days till the festival starts.
I'll get paid right after wards.
And I'll bring it to you.
Here you go.
- How much are you getting?
- Enough to cover it.
I'll pay the debt,
don't worry.
I'm taking your car too.
Why?
Ever heard of
the interest rate lobby?
Yes.
That's us.
- We're finished.
- Don't give me that.
Wait, I'm thinking.
Where did that Hüseyin come from?
If he hadn't butted in, we'd be fine.
So what do we do?
Kidnap him
to get him out the way?
Let's scoot. If the captain finds out
the money is hot air, we're toast.
- Help!
- A man's drowning!
Save me! Save me!
He fell off the boat.
He's drowning.
Ah, yes.
Did someone jump?
Is someone saving him?
My gosh, he jumped.
One of you help.
We'll kidnap someone, but not Hüseyin.
- What are you talking about?
- C'mon.
Stop! What are you doing?
This is a Town Hall announcement.
Local resident Hüseyin Badem's baby...
Has disappeared from the quayside
in his stroller.
If you see the baby, kindly report
to the Town Hall or gendarmerie.
Bayram!
They kidnapped my son.
They kidnapped my baby.
Firuzan Abla, please say
who kidnapped my baby.
Who would do it? Why?
Müjgan, please don't cry.
They'll find our baby.
When you cry I feel terrible.
Calm down, they'll find him.
Right now I wanna die.
There's a curse on Geyikli.
Every visit something happens.
Shut up!
Just shut up!
We're all torn up
and you're all site reports!
Geyikli, whatever, enough!
Argh, enough!
Hüseyin!
Calm down.
We aren't sure
but we think the baby was kidnapped.
They dumped the stroller.
Hey! Let the commander speak.
Don't cry, Müjgan.
We'll find whoever did it.
Hüseyin, keep an eye on your phone.
If they call for a ransom, contact us.
He's so cute.
Can't we keep him?
Are you crazy?
C'mon, give him here.
No, don't touch. He's sleepy.
He'll only have a meltdown.
Hey there! Hey there!
See what you do?
Idiot.
I'd cry too if it was me.
- C'mon, get him quiet if you can.
- Sure. What's the big deal?
He won't stop crying.
We got the baby
a ton of pacifiers.
Pacifiers are supposed to work!
I tell you,
my nerves are shot.
Here, tum on this radio.
Drown out that crying.
I'm a nervous wreck.
Tum it off.
Turn it on again.
He got the baby into music.
Poor thing.
He thinks his dad's here.
We should give him back,
it's a sin.
He's not some pigeon
we can just give back.
Cut the crap.
2 days.
For2 days we'll, you know.
Have the prince to stay.
Then we'll take him back.
We're already screwed.
Don't make me feel guilty.
Good boy, junior, good boy.
OK, say bye-bye to Halit Abi.
Say bye-bye.
Get back inside.
Morning.
Morning.
When's his mom coming?
You must be tired out.
She's out of hospital tomorrow.
I'll go pick her up.
- That's great.
- Thanks. Take it easy there.
They'll be glad of the milk.
- How come?
- Mom had an accident. He's babysitting.
- You don't say.
- Sure.
What if they sold him
to a beggar?
Be positive, Müjgan.
C'mon, precious.
I promise
I'll find our baby.
Whoever stole him,
I swear I'll dismember them...
And stick their parts
at every junction.
It's all my fault.
With all those checkpoints
why can't the gendarmes find them?
Maybe they're somewhere round here.
Come with me, Hüseyin.
- Come where?
- Move.
- Where are you going?
- I'm curious.
- Sema, look after Müjgan.
- OK.
Come in.
Sorry about the news.
I guess the festival's canceled.
How can we cancel with the Greeks here
and the minister coming?
And we spent all that money.
So? I don't suppose
Firuzan will do her thing.
No.
Can we find someone else?
Ebru Kartepe.
The only free artist I know.
What do we pay her?
- 20,000, end of story.
- OK.
Welcome, Hüseyin.
I'm so sorry.
- Any news?
- No. Thanks, though.
Abla, why are we here?
Are there any other pharmacies
around here, my friend?
Not in Geyikli. Why?
I'm not mistaken, am I?
No, it's not that.
Did anyone buy diapers, any baby stuff
from you in the last 24 hours?
Yes. But why are you asking?
I don't understand.
C'mon, answer.
A ton of vacationers pass through,
many of them with kids.
Who knows what we sold
since yesterday?
OK, but anyone unusual,
anyone nervous?
- Someone like that...
- Ha. The guy yesterday.
Remember he kept asking
how to mix the baby food?
Who was that, Kasım?
No one we know, Hüseyin.
A man came as we were closing.
He wanted two of everything.
He even had us pick a pacifier.
He was in a sweat.
We had to laugh to ourselves.
- OK, what was he like?
- Nervous.
What did he look like?
Receding hairline.
Prominent temples.
He'll be bald in a year or so.
My age.
No way!
You're older.
Don't talk crap
in front of the lady!
We're trying to help here.
OK, let's say your age,
more or less.
More, not less.
OK, did this man have a beard?
No.
A moustache.
He was a bit rounder than me.
- No, you're fatter.
- Why are you giving me a hard time?
- Enough!
- Exactly, enough!
Quiet, andropausal boys!
Would you recognize him
if you saw him?
Yes.
We'd recognize him, Ms. Firuzan.
OK, great.
We'll get a robot picture done.
Ha, bravo.
What's a robot picture?
You know.
When they do a sketch.
Of the suspect.
The police hang them up in a line.
Robot police.
Police artists.
You think this is New York?
You won't find a police artist!
We have 2 policemen,
both traffic police.
If anyone has one
it's the gendarmes.
Let's ask them.
C'mon, Asım Abi. Kasım.
OK. Close the shop.
- Are they coming too?
- Who else is there as witness?
The picture was your idea.
- OK.
- C'mon, shut up shop.
How's this?
It's like him.
He was maybe a bit rounder.
OK. You come with me.
We reckon Kiremitoba Village
is the scene of the kidnapping.
Please have the nearest units
transferred to the crime scene.
Roger. Units are being directed
to investigate.
OK, Hüseyin. We'll be in touch.
You can go.
Thanks, commander.
Thanks.
Abla, you heard what the two-way said?
A kidnapping, an operation.
Kiremitoba Village.
That's right here.
I've been to 500 weddings there.
Let's take a look.
- Maybe a girl was kidnapped.
- He turned off the two-way right away.
I say they're about to find Bayram.
They're keeping quiet
so we don't get worked up.
Nice thinking, Mercedes Abla.
Let's hope so.
I keep thinking about his tiny feet.
Abla, let's go.
It's a hope.
C'mon, then.
Let's hope.
Dear God, let's hope.
- You haven't seen anyone, huh?
- No.
Thanks.
Anything new?
No.
Let's go back then.
Ha! Why didn't I think of it?
What's up?
There's a milkman around here,
he's called Rasim. He knows everything.
Where is this Rasim?
Real close.
We tum up there.
See there?
- Up there?
- Right, look there.
- Go up there.
- You mean go straight?
Go left by the pear tree,
but the road's rough.
Slowly now.
We'll leave the car here. Stop.
Stop here.
We'll walk the rest.
How come?
What about the car?
We can't go down there in this car.
We'd wreck the undercarriage.
His place is on the path down there.
We shoot downhill.
C'mon.
Can I stay in the car?
Your choice.
- Which way? Down here?
- Right, this way.
Hüseyin!
Hüseyin! Hüseyin, Firuzan!
Wait for me!
Hüseyin, Firuzan, wait for me!
You disappeared so fast!
A snake, a snake!
Help, a snake!
A snake, a snake!
Mercedes!
Mercedes, are you OK?
There was a huge snake.
But snakes here don't do anything.
They aren't poisonous.
You mangled yourself for nothing.
Drop it, will you!
The woman was scared.
I think I broke my leg.
What do we do?
C'mon, we'll lift her.
We can't lift her.
Look at you, fatso. Don't be so rude.
Your ass would make 3 grown men.
What kind of talk is that?
Shame on you, Mercedes.
An insult like that
from a woman of Europe!
Knock it off!
You know what we'll do?
Go ask Rasim for help. C'mon.
No! Don't go anywhere.
Don't leave me. I'm scared to death.
What do we do?
What can we? She's scared.
Wait, I got it. Wait.
Slow down, there's rocks.
You'll tip her over.
Zip it!
Don't get me started.
I'm an idiot for ever trusting you.
How many times is this?
Stop wailing, Mercedes.
It's all your fault.
The gendarmes found the baby
and all that crap.
Shame on you, Firuzan!
How could you!
Why are you blaming the woman?
Bless you, Mercedes.
You gave me hope.
Screw your hope.
Look at you both!
Zagor and Chico.
God help me!
- Careful of the thorns!
- Oh God, thorns!
We're here.
Open the gate.
Open the gate.
For goodness sake, Abla.
- The thorns are pricking me!
- Stop moaning.
Who are they?
You said no one was coming.
- Quick, I can't hold her much longer.
- Coming.
- How do we lift her?
- How do I know?
- Let's tip her out.
- Where?
Anywhere is fine.
She was OK rolling down the hill.
- Careful!
- Here we go.
Watch out.
Are you OK?
Rasim Abi.
Rasim Abi!
Rasim Abi!
Rasim Abi!
He's not answering.
Why isn't he answering?
Here, drink this.
He's deaf and dumb,
but he's a great marksman.
You guys, stop twitching.
Sit still!
Hüseyin!
What are you doing here?
They stole my baby.
I was gonna ask if you heard anything,
if you saw any crooked types.
What else is he gonna see
in this crooked damn field?
- What's going on? Who are they?
- They're butchering my animals.
- You called a butcher?
- They just turned up.
They're thieves.
I heard they hung out in Foça,
but now they're here too.
They butcher them, load them into vans
and move on.
So that's where "meat market"
comes from!
No time to market your IQ, sweetie.
We're dead meat here.
So that's what they meant
on the two-way.
Remember the kidnapping thing?
I thought they meant Bayram Berk.
But they meant goat-napping.
Oof!
- So the gendarmes could come any time.
- Hopefully before we're sausage-meat!
My animals are dying!
My sheep and goats!
What are you talking about?
You can get more animals.
We're about to die here. Maniac!
Maniac.
Don't cry! My son's gone
and you think about your animals.
What kind of guy are you?
A grown man crying.
It's our turn now.
Mr. Butcher.
Blondie.
Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ.
Come sit beside me, salami man.
What do you want?
What do YOU want?
Are you crazy?
We came here for a good time.
And you're just interested in lamb.
Look.
You're missing
prime cuts here, sugar.
Leave the cold cuts.
Come try the hot stuff.
Rasim. Why didn't you say?
Who are these guys?
They're here for me.
He brings them.
You know, being single.
- You sell them, huh?
- Right. I sell them.
Lo and behold!
Well, we would.
But we can't with our hands tied.
Look at you,
all over a sheep.
You could be enjoying
the sweetest company here. But no.
It's silence of the lambs.
What do you sell them for?
They're both different.
- What are you thinking?
- To butcher the lot of you.
Hey, come here. You're tired.
I'll wipe away your sweat.
You come here, blondie.
C'mon. Let me untie you.
I'll treat myself to a hot snack.
Good for you. You're smart.
Mr. Brain-box.
Take this!
- Quick, grab him.
- Don't hit my head.
Bash his head with something.
- Run. Run!
- Move it!
Run. To the van, quick.
Firuzan Abla.
Quick! To the van. C'mon.
- Run. Keep going.
- Open the door.
Come here!
Hey!
Climb in.
Move! Get in the truck
before the gendarmes come!
Thanks, Firuzan.
You saved our lives.
Dying would've been fine by me.
Müjgan will be worried.
They took our phones. What do we do?
There's a phone there, look.
Use that.
Thanks.
What do I tell Müjgan?
We didn't find Bayram?
We almost died?
- Better not to call.
- Wait.
I just remembered.
You know Taşkapı Camping?
In Kumburun?
I took milk there this morning.
You know the half-wit owner.
He said the guys would be
pleased as punch.
He said they're babysitting the baby.
The mom had an accident.
He said he laughs at them.
Why? The mom had an accident!
Maniac!
The baby stops crying
when he hears music.
- Otherwise he keeps everyone up.
- That's my baby! That's Bayram!
I got him into music.
I played him clarinet.
He misses the sound.
We found him, I know it!
I told you he'd find him.
Go right to Kumburun!
Quick!
Let's hope.
Müjgan, put Dad on!
Put Dad on.
Can't you find any music?
Tum that thing on.
There's nothing on.
C'mon, you had a sleep, you had food.
C'mon.
Oh my God!
What's up?
We're in holy shit.
Leave the baby. Run!
Scram!
Leave the baby!
Quick, they're here!
Run!
Dad, stop! It may not be them.
- The baby! Put that gun away.
- Shut up!
- Yes?
- Where's my grandson?
- There's a baby in there but...
- Move!
I can hear him, Mum.
Bayram!
Bayram! Bayram!
They found him.
Run for the car.
Where are they?
Who stole him?
There they are! Come here!
Get them!
Don't run away. Come here.
Hey, come here!
Come here!
Hey, come here!
What did you want with my baby!
Don't run away!
What kind of guy are you!
Halit? It's Halit! Come here!
Start the engine.
They're coming.
Isn't it you, Halit?
It's you!
What did you want from us?
Come here!
Come here!
Don't run away!
Don't run away.
Cramp! I got cramp.
Hüseyin! I'm here, Hüseyin.
Don't hold my neck.
Hold on to me.
Damn your heroics, Hüseyin!
You'll drown the woman!
Let's be glad it's all over.
Thank goodness! Geyikli never saw
such a snake in the grass.
No one steals here! He even swiped
our Greek friends' money.
But thanks to the Reverend here,
our artists said they'd still perform.
It's nothing, Mayor.
We found the baby, huh?
What's the story, commander?
Did you catch the rogues?
Our boats are looking, chief.
No sign of land either.
I guess this time we...
Man, you're such a pessimist!
- While there's life there's hope.
- You never stop!
Look, a boat!
A boat's coming!
A boat's coming!
Boat! Boat!
We're here, boat!
Boat! Boat!
It's coming right at us.
- The captain!
- The captain?
Halit Abi!
All right, I see.
Oof, the minister's on his way.
Ms. Firuzan, after all your trials
we obviously can't ask you to perform.
But thanks all the same.
Geyikli loves you.
Thanks.
Hello there.
Mayor, I'm afraid
my theater crew have left.
- What?
- They went back to Istanbul.
The crook swiped their money too.
And he deceived me.
The guys said no deal.
I couldn't stop them.
Oh no!
Hold on, Mayor.
A job started must be finished.
Count me in.
Thanks, you're wonderful.
I'd say the same,
but I have no actors.
WELCOME TO THE 12TH INTERNATIONAL
GEYİKLİ CULTURE & OLIVE FESTIVAL
What's that smell, Helena?
And that music?
What's that whiff of seduction
in the air?
Me, Pan.
Nature's shepherd.
Hear my flute...
Breathe my smell.
Is your wish for an ordinary life
or for love?
My only wish is for Helena,
Mighty Pan!
Even if the price is heavy.
The fire inside me bums for Paris.
That fire is the fire of Hades.
The price is very heavy, Paris.
Troy's fate is written in blood.
Are you ready to pay Hades that price?
I'm ready to do anything for love.
Pitiful mortals,
let's ask Mighty Zeus then.
Will you allow Pan...
To play the flute of love in Troy,
Mighty Zeus?
Zeus?
I allow anyone to die for love.
- But plant an olive on Mt Olympos.
- What? An olive?
They ate the fruit of forbidden love.
Let Trojans make ready for war.
What's that?
I beg you, Hera.
If Troy is to die for our love...
Stop this destruction.
I'll give up on Paris...
- Hüseyin, when's this play ending?
- Even if stabbed by Heracles' sword.
Quiet!
Long live Troy!
Long live Troy!
Firuzan! Firuzan! Firuzan!
Thank you so much.
Dear people of Geyikli,
I missed you so much.
- Did you miss me too?
- Yes!
- Did you like the play?
- Yes!
Yes, yes. Thanks.
Thanks to our director, Can Hodja.
We did our best to give you
a play from Ancient Greece.
Thank you very much.
And of course my very dear friend
who introduced me to you...
The amazing Hüseyin Badem!
Let's hear it for him.
Thank you so much.
Hüseyin...
...Müjgan and baby,
huge kisses to you all.
Good luck to you all.
OK, all together now let's sing...
"C'mon, love, love"!
Yorgo! Let's hear it for Yorgo!
Hüseyin Badem!
Spaniard!
Firuzan, I love you.
Marry me. Spaniard.
Firuzan.
Will you marry me?
Bravo, Spaniard!
Abla. C'mon, say yes.
- Say yes.
- Say yes! Say yes!
- Yes!
- Bravo! Bravo!
I don't believe it.
I love you, Müjgan.
I love you too, musician.
Oh no.
Give me the clarinet.
Quick.
Wait.
Here. C'mon, play.
OK.
He's asleep.
