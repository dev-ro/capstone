My leg! My leg!
My leg!
My leg!
Okay.
My leg!
My leg!
My leg!
My leg! My leg!
My leg!
My leg!Aaah!
Th... That's me!
What the hell's going on?
It's time to return.
Look into his eyes.
I can't believe it.
MAN: Listen.
In almost
all instances,
coronary occlusion results
from arteriosclerosis,
a degenerative disease
of the arteries
caused by development
of fatty fibrotic deposits
in the arterial wall.
The endothelial
cell damage
in the inside surface
of the artery
causes
a two-fold effect,
so the smooth
muscle cells
lying deep in the endothelium
start to multiply
and protrude
against the endothelium
cell lining.
Fatty substances
begin to deposit
around the muscle cells,
causing development
of a fibrotic lesion.
Now, when the aortic
or pulmonary arteries
are obstructed,
you're into the area
of myocardiac
infarctions
or neurosis
of the myocardium.
Got it, Chris?
Yeah.
It sounds more difficult
than it is.
Let's go over it
again.
No, I think I understand.
When the aortic
or pulmonary arteries
are obstructed,
you're into the area
of myocardiac
infarctions or--
Dad...
I got it.
Chris, you can't
"get" anything.
You have to know it.
What would the faculty
at Northwestern say?
Dad, I'm in the 12th grade.
When I was your age,
I was in my second...
year at Oxford.
Year at Oxford.
Angiocratic menosis...
There's nothing
that fascinates me more
than the human body,
and no part of the human body
is quite as mysterious
and wondrous
as the heart,
so let's start with the aorta,
and work our way
through the entire system...
uh...
by which blood is distributed
through the body.
Damn!
Uh... uh...
but when the aortic
or pulmonary arteries
are obstructed,
you're into the
area of myocar--
Riveting.
Dr. Hammond.
Dr. Hartwood on four.
This is
Mr. Racine.
He's 47.
Two days ago,
he underwent
an aortic valve
replacement.
How are you feeling
today, Mr. Racine?
I don't know, doc.
My right leg kinda hurts
and I'm burning up.
Mr. Racine has
a low-grade fever
and is exhibiting
tenderness
in his lower right calf.
Undoubtedly phlebitis.
In su--
In such cases,
an anticoagulant
is prescribed.
For such minor
incidents as this,
I would suggest--
75 milligrams
of Synkavite.
Very good, Dr. Spellner,
but as death is not
our objective here,
I would suggest
10 milligrams
of Coumadin.
Hernia.
It's all
in the chart.
Uh, that
rectangular thing
that Dr. O'Donald
is presently fondling.
Let's go.
Dr. Larkin, hospital policy
prohibits the treatment
of patients without
medical insurance--
This gentleman doesn't
give a rat's ass
about hospital policy,
and neither do I.
A hospital's a place
where people come
to get well.
Um, scurry on. I'll catch up.
I know you think
only rich people
should get sick,
but it just doesn't
work that way.
I'm sorry, Dr. Larkin,
but there's nothing I can do.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Put him in there for me.
Keep shouting.
There's a few patients
you haven't disturbed.
I've got a man here
complaining of chest pains.
He's got to be
admitted right away.
She's got a man
with no insurance.
I don't know where
she keeps finding them.
Send him to County.
There you have it.
What?
You know what the policy is.
No insurance--
Policy, shmolicy!
This man needs
medical attention.
Remember how to do that, Jack?
You used to.
You used to be the best
surgeon in this city.
Still am. Send him to County.
Good morning, all.
What seems to be
the problem?
Oh, money
and my patient's lack of it.
Dr. Larkin,
if you want to carry
this crusade any further.
bring it up again
at the board meeting.
An have them
kick my ass again?
If the shoe fits.
Mind if I join you
on rounds, Jack?
No.
Sorry.
County will treat you fine.
Chris, I thought it was
a great speech.
It started out
about the heart
and ended up being
about the brain...
damage.
Oh, wait,
there she is.
There she is, man.
Lori
Shh, shh.
Where, where?
All right, man. Now, all
I have to do is ask her.
Well, you could
split up the tickets
and give her one,
and when she goes,
she'll be sitting
right next to you,
and then let
the fun begin.
No, she is great.
She is so great.
No, I can't do it. No.
I'm selling the tickets.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Just walk up to her,
look her right in the eye,
and say, "Lori,
will you go with me
"to the concert
tomorrow night?
And if not, I'll
set fire to you."
How can she stand
to be so close
to her own body
without constantly
feeling herself up?
Chris? Go.
Oh, right.
Do I look all right?
You look good. Breath.
No, no, no, Trigger.
I can't. I can't, man.
If you could
just go up there
and ask her out for me,
tell her
I injured my voice
rescuing hostages
or something.
Uh, hi.
Hi.
Hi, Charlie.
No, it's Chris.
Um, Lori, I was
just wondering,
tomorrow night,
if, uh, you weren't
doing anything,
that maybe we could go out,
or if you were
doing something,
I understand, or even
if you weren't doing anything
and didn't want to,
that'd be okay.
Are you serious?
No, not really,
but it was just that,
uh, well,
I wound up
with these two tickets
to a concert
tomorrow night
and I thought that...
that since you remind me so
much of Heather Thomas--
Locklear.
Locklear, that, um--
Well, what are the seats like?
Front row--
Aisle or center?
Center.
Look,
sorry I canceled our date
for tomorrow night, babe,
but my parents are forcing me
to go to my grandmother's
for dinner.
It's a really big deal to her.
Well, it doesn't matter, Rick.
I'm going to the concert with,
uh...
Uh, Chris.
Hey, Rick.
Him?
He considers me more important
than his grandmother.
Right, Chris?
Right. Nothing.
Nothing.
She means nothing to me,
right, Trigger?
Hates her.
Fine, if that's the way
you want to play.
Larry, I have been
in your office
for 15 minutes.
Don't keep me waiting.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ginnie.
Mm.
I was making rounds with Jack.
His wife is dead,
so he can take
all the time he likes.
Hello, Jack.
It's been a while.
Yes, far too long, Ginnie.
Dear, I hope you're
going to take my advice
and make Jack the next
Chief of Staff.
Well, I may just do that.
He's a good man.
Lord knows they're
hard to find.
Well, I'll...
I'll be happy
to serve this hospital
in any capacity you see fit.
Either of you.
Hmm.
Excuse me.
Dr. Armbruster?
May I interrupt you
for a moment?
Yes, of course.
I'll be right back.
Jack, entertain my wife in
your patented manner,
will you?
I shall
make the attempt.
Modesty, thy name is Jack.
Hmm.
I wonder if you know
what you could do
to really entertain me.
Well, wait a minute.
Let me think.
Why are you always so shy?
Why are you always so married?
You were performing
a very delicate operation
in a dream I had last night.
Then I suppose
I'd be wrong to bill you.
You had very sure hands.
I wonder what it would be like
if I were awake.
Most operations
are best performed
with the patient asleep.
Ah.
Yes.
Dear,
he definitely
has the ability
to handle people.
I think he's a born
administrator.
Jack, you should
appoint this woman
your campaign manager.
Well, I would
if I was campaigning
for Chief of Staff.
Instead,
I remain quasi-available
and fashionably aloof.
Oh, that's good.
That's very good.
Aren't you late for surgery?
Yes, I am.
Well, then.
Well, then.
Oh. So cool.
You want to stick it in
Tisdale's lunch for a laugh?
No, I can't do this.
I'm sorry, I...
This is wrong.
No, it's, no.
No.
Dr. Hammond.
You seem to be hoping
this frog will
commit suicide.
I suggest you overcome
your delicate
sensibilities
or fail class
for the day.
Do I make myself clear?
Crystal clear, sir.
Attaboy, Hammond.
Start at the gizzard,
slice this sucker
open,
and scoop out
the intestines.
Piece of cake.
Kill, kill,
kill, kill.
Ka, ka, ka, ka.
Kill, kill,
kill, kill.
Ugh.
Sorry.
Blood pressure is too low.
You want him
on dopamine?
I just want
his pressure up.
Aye-aye, captain.
Let's get him stable.
I want to get him
off the bypass.
You're in a good mood, Jack.
I had to tutor Chris
for his biology midterm,
and then spent the rest of
the night and
the early morning
getting the equipment
forecasts for this
bloody hospital.
No pun intended.
Let's come off bypass.
NURSE: We're off,
Dr. Hammond.
When you're
Chief of Staff,
do I call you chief?
"O, Exalted One" will do.
We're losing
one hell of a surgeon, Jack.
You're right.
What do you say we
go out for a couple of
drinks tonight?
You never
socialize anymore.
You haven't been
out of the house
since Jan passed away.
No, I don't think so.
Close for me, please.
50.5!
Way to gut it out, Hammond.
You're pacing yourself.
I like that kick you're using.
Hey, it's the Hammond Kick!
Hammond Kick, huh?
Well, it's official.
Hammond, you're on anchor
at the Districts tomorrow.
Anderson, you lead off.
Come on, Coach.
It was a fluke.
You can't make
Hammond anchor.
I just did.
Hit the showers!
I'm warning you, Hammond.
You're getting
in my face
too often.
You better watch your step,
dickhead.
Look, Rick, come on.
We're on the same team.
What do you say we just
call a little truce, okay?
Okay, for the good
of the school, asshole.
Hey, Rick.
What?
Nice race.
Look, Rick,
whatever you want, okay?
Come on, Rick.
Leave him alone.
He's a good kid.
Yeah, well, you better
watch your step,
dickhead.
That guy is huge.
I mean, what is it?
A glandular disorder
or what?
I don't know,
but sooner or later,
he is going to freak,
and I wouldn't
want to be here
when he does.
I think there should be
a size requirement
for high school.
Oh, God!
How bad?
The worst.
Look. A "C."
A "C"?
A "C."
I am dead meat.
I am sitting on a hook,
rotting in the sun.
Flies are, like,
gathering around me.
I am dead meat.
For what?
For a "C"?
My dad would give me
his porno collection
if I got a "C."
A "C"? I cannot believe a "C."
TRIGGER: Hey, thanks
for the ride, Chris.
Good luck at home.
Hey, man, there is
no good luck at home.
Only death by lasers
emitted from
my father's eyes.
Ah, you'll get into
a med program somewhere.
Hey, man,
what's that?
That's my Uncle Earl.
He's been staying
with us
for the last
couple of days,
stinking up the house.
He's leaving today.
Probably on his way
to Venus.
Hey, Earl,
how you doing?
Pretty creepy-looking
to me, there, Trigger.
Yeah,
he's
an archaeologist.
Creepy is
his life's work.
Hey, listen,
I gotta get home
so my father
can end my life.
Oh, wait, let me see
if I can get him
talking about his
brain transference serum.
It could make
med school obsolete.
Brain transference serum.
He was talking about it
last night.
He's got it in those
boxes up there.
The one marked
"Brain Transference
Serum."
You gotta keep
an open mind about it.
You should see
the scar on his leg.
Hey, Earl,
can you
tell my friend
about how the Indians
operated on your leg
and you didn't
feel anything?
No.
Great talking
to you, Earl.
I'll get him
to talk about it.
Just wait.
Nah. Forget it, man.
Look, I'll see you tomorrow,
and if brain transference
has anything to do
with having your head
handed to you,
you and your Uncle Earl
can come on over to my house
and watch.
See you tomorrow.
Later.
ANNOUNCER: MTV.
It's an attitude.
MTV.
I'm a real wild one.
WOMAN'S VOICE:
Sit tight
and listen carefully
while I...
Hi, man.
I thought you were my dad.
Nope. Taller.
Uh, Tabasco sauce?
Brain transference serum.
Oh, shit.
Trigger,
what are you doing?
Hey, dude, I went through
a lot of trouble
siphoning this stuff off
from my uncle
without him seeing it.
Now, we can
at least try it.
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna
try this stuff.
Come on.
No.
You're not gonna try
anything.
Hello, Seymour.
I have a little present
for you.
All right, come on.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Come on, this stuff
looks like cooking oil.
Yeah, well, let's see
what it can do.
Well, be careful,
be careful.
Trigger, come on.
This is stupid.
Trigger, how did that happen?
Did you ever see
The Emerald Forest,
where the guy,
he swallows some stuff
and turns into a panther?
No.
Same principle.
Hey, did either of you
notice anything unusual
about Seymour and
Sparky today?
No.
No.
Oh, gosh, it's my dad.
I'm out of here.
Terrific.
Come on, Trig.
Just stay for dinner
and lessen the blow.
Will you relax?
I don't see
what the big deal is.
You just blew
an assignment.
Yeah, I know.
It's a big deal.
You know my dad.
Look, you don't want to be
in med school anyway.
Now, if I was you,
I'd tell the Ayatollah
to get off my back, Jack.
Dr. Hammond!
What a delightful
surprise.
Isn't it?
Uh, Trigger, you're
staying for dinner.
Well?
How'd you do, Chris?
You know, doc,
that's a great jacket.
It really brings out...
The color
in my eyes.
Yeah, right. Chris?
Um, the grades
aren't being posted
till Monday,
so I don't know.
Monday?
I was hoping you'd hear
before the weekend.
Yeah, I know,
but, uh...
Oh, listen, Dad,
I'm running anchor
in the mile relay
at the District
Championships tomorrow.
Well, good.
Be sure to mention that
to the guy
from Northwestern
on Friday.
Dr. Hammond,
I'm leaving in a minute.
The spaghetti's nearly ready,
the bread is in the oven,
and the salad's in the fridge.
Aba-daba-daba-dab.
See you later, Phyllis.
What?
Right.
Dad, I need to talk to you
about that interview
with the guy
from Northwestern.
How about that interview
with Lori Beaumont?
Well, you re-confirmed it,
didn't you?
Uh, yeah.
Damn right. I mean, let's
face it. You lucked out.
She's major league
action.
I didn't think
you had a prayer.
You said I was
the ultra dude.
Yeah, but I didn't mean it.
I mean, she's used
to going out with guys
that look like a cross
between Don Johnson
and Sylvester Stallone.
Oh, yeah?
So what does that make me?
Well, you're more of a cross
between Sylvester Stallone
and Don Knotts.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're like
a cross between, uh,
Don Knotts
and Sylvester the Cat
with, like,
maybe a lint ball mixed in
for IQ purposes.
Hey, dude, after what you got
on that biology presentation,
I don't think
you qualify
to be making
IQ judgments.
I mentioned that jacket
already, haven't I?
Herringbone or something?
What the hell did you get?
Oh, oh, oh,
you mean the actual grades.
Well, those are gonna
be posted on Monday,
but, um, Trigger is...
Trigger's talking
about the...
Temporary! Temporary!
They can change at any time.
They're just temporary grades,
and those are gonna, like,
change without notice,
so for the time being,
I...
It may appear that I...
may have gotten a...
A "C."
A "C." What actually--
A "C"
TRIGGER: So, uh, thanks
for the chow, Chris,
and glad I could
be of help.
Doc, again,
great wardrobe.
Thousands of herrings
must have died
for that jacket.
A "C"?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I really...
I tried my best,
but I'm just not...
Hammonds just
don't get "Cs."
Chris?
Dad?
I don't fucking believe it.
Chris?
Dad?
TRIGGER: Oh, shit.
Ugh! Ugh!
Are you in there?
Yeah, Dad.
I'm old.
I don't believe it.
Uh...
All right,
just stay calm.
There's bound to be a very...
rational...
scientific...
explanation
for all of this.
There is.
You put Tabasco sauce
in your Bloody Mary.
Oh, God.
Dr. Hammond...
Dr. Hammond...
I feel a little responsible
about what's happened here.
Uh-huh.
See, it started out,
we were fooling around
with my uncle's brain
transference serum--
There's no such thing
as a brain transference.
No sweat.
Uh, I seem to remember
my uncle saying something
about it not lasting
very long.
I can ask him, uh,
but he's gone.
Well, not dead.
Just gone.
Listen to me,
you little asshole.
I don't care
where your uncle is,
or what you have to
go through to find him,
but you go right now
and do whatever the hell
you have to do
to get us out
of this thing,
and if you don't,
you'll never
finish puberty.
Do I make myself clear?
Oh!
Sorry, Dad.
Trigger.
Trigger.
Oh, boy. Oh, no.
Dr. Hammond?
Is that you?
No. Uh, yes.
I was just wondering
if you'd seen my cat.
No.
No. Damn cat.
Uh, well, then,
Walter,
I wonder, uh...
could I have a word alone
with your fine boy, Clarence?
Sure.
I'll see you at the
front door!
* Well, all around town
My name is mud *
* But I can't help it
'Cause it's in my blood *
* I make it no secret
It's plain to see *

Uh-huh.
I'll have a martini.
You want that on the rocks?
No, in a glass is fine,
and could I have some ice
with that, please?
And what would be
your finest champagne?
Louis Roederer Cristal,
and you're not
getting any.
Yeah.
This sucks.
I'm gonna cruise the joint,

Well, well, well.
Who have we here?
We have... moi.
Me.
When I saw you a moment ago,
a shiver ran through my body.
Do you think I need something
to warm me up?
You mean like a hot chocolate?
I was thinking
of something
a little more personal
and a lot more private.
Private, as in just
you and me?
Can't think of anyone else
I'd like to invite.
Okay.
Okay?
Uh, the place is full of nuns.
Hello, there. How you doing?
The name's Trigger,
as in horse,
as in "hung like."
Uh, this is...
my son's friend.
Oh.
Yeah, see, me and him,
we're inseparable.
Yeah.
The age difference
doesn't matter
because I think like an adult,
and I also do other things
like an adult.
Yeah.
Um, I have to go.
It's been charming
to meet
your son's friend.
The charm was all mine.
I'll be seeing you.
Yeah, sure.
Any time.
Any time?
Sure.
Let's rock and roll.
* Everybody have fun tonight
On the house!
* Everybody Wang
Chung tonight *
* Everybody have fun tonight
Whoo!
...and I'm Wally.
We have some lines
open right now,
so give us a call.
All right,
you're on the air.
MAN: Uh, oh, hi, Wally?
Yeah, hi.
I'm a first-time caller.
All right. Thanks.
COMPUTER VOICE:
The key is in the ignition.
The key is in the ignition.
The key is in the ignition.
The key is in the igni...
Now, what do you
mean by that?
"Leave it
or live with it."
Well, you know,
like an alligator...
Some alligators have teeth
that can kill an adult.
What happens when the
good guys have no gun...
The key is in the ignition.
Right, right.
Now, that's the type
of moronic answer
that I get
every morning here.
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Oh, shit!
The key is
in the ignition.
The key is
in the ignition.
What the hell
have you done to me?
Dad, could you
hold it down a little?
You're drunk.
You're drunk.
No. I'm dead.
You're damn right you're dead.
Jesus, Chris,
look at you.
You've been out
all night
doing God knows what
in my body.
All right!
Using my cash,
probably
boozing it up,
and where in the hell
did you get the money
to pay for an outfit
like that?
I only had $20
in my wallet.
Well, Dad--
My credit card.
My...
You used
my credit card!
Get in the house.
You are grounded...
for the rest
of your life!
Yeah, all right!
Lean on him!
Up yours.
The key is
in the ignition.
Do you mind? I'm on a diet.
Oh.
Sorry, sorry. I forgot.
Hey, good morning,
Dr. Hammond...
or Chris.
Whatever.
Hey, what happened
with Uncle Earl?
You look like a geek.
What about Earl?
Well, it seems there's
no phones in the
Zocolo rainforest,
but I did leave a message
with the chief
of their local police,
and Uncle Earl should be
getting back to us pronto!
Well, pronto isn't
good enough.
Don't worry.
I'll find him.
Chris,
um, here's your excuse
for missing work today.
I want you
to call my...
I want you
to call my office
at precisely 9:00 a.m.
and read this note, okay?
Hey, Dad, where're you going?
To school.
What?
Hey, Dad! Come on!
You'll wreck everything.
What are you doing?
Chris,
it's the best thing.
See you later, Chris!
Dad, come on!
Come on, you can't do this!
That's my school!
You'll ruin everything!
This is the best thing, Son.
Trust me.
You can't go
to my school,
for God's sake!
Come on, stop!
Now, I don't want you
leaving this house
under any
circumstances
until I get home.
I'm not gonna let you do this!
All right! Kill your own son!
All right. Have a good time.
Dad!

LORI: No! I told you already.
You had your chance.
I'm going
to the concert
with Chris Hammond.
Come on,
the guy's a dork.
What's he got
that I haven't got?
Excuse me, son.
A Jaguar,
for starters.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna park there,
all right?
Uh, may I advise you
not to do that, sir?
That's Rick Anderson.
Never heard of him.
Come on, let's go.
I wouldn't
do that, sir.
Chris, are you
all right?
You look kind of funny.
Um, ah, yes, yes.
I'm really looking forward
to the concert tonight.
What concert?
Are mag wheels optional
on the XJ6?
See you.
Does this sort of thing
happen...
often?
Doc, it's really not cool to
scam on your own son's date.
Look!
* Somebody
* Somebody put something
In my drink *

Dr. Hammond,
it's nearly 9:30.
You should be at work.
Oh!
Yeah.
Uh, hi, Norma.
Yeah.
Uh, this is Chris...
uh, Chris' father,
Dr. Hammond.
Norma, I'm gonna be unable
to come to the hospital
for the next few days
because I'm suffering
from an acute attack
120-hour flu
and a very severe case
of laryn...
laryngitis.
Uh, yeah.
Please refer all my calls
and appointments
to Dr. Roger Hartwood.
Thank you.
The main bronchi...
are distributed
around the whole circumference
of the tubes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What, did you fart?
Move.
Stop that!
"Stop that!
Stop that!"
Excuse me, is that seat taken?
No, we saved it
just for you, dude.
Well, thank you.
Well, well, good morning,
Hammond.
I do apologize for dragging
you in here so early.
That's quite all right.
Hammond,
do you think
you have a strong grasp
of the respiratory system?
Very strong.
Well, then, up to the board.
Okay.
Well, Dr. Hammond says
he has a strong grasp
of today's material.
We'll give him
a chance to prove it
by sharing
his vast knowledge
of the respiratory system
with us.
Hammond,
why don't you
complete the diagram
for all of us?
Okay.
Well,
your sketch work here
is a bit remedial,
although it does have
a certain
kindergarten charm.
The main bronchi
and its branches
present only irregular
cartilaginous plates.
Oh, Dr. Armbruster?
Dr. Armbruster?
Dr. Hammond
just called,
said he wasn't
feeling very well,
wouldn't be coming in.
Well, that's a first.
It must be serious.
You know,
I'm having lunch out that way.
I'll drop by and check on him.
Dr. Hammond?
Dr. Hammond?
Uh
I'm going out
for some groceries.
I will be back in about
an hour.
* Whoo
* She's only 15
* She's the reason
The reason that
I can't sleep *
* You say illegal
* I say legal's
Never been my scene *
* Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
* I try like hell
But I'm out of control *
A quasi-humorous
side-note
to this election
is that Martin Van Buren,
who'd been born and raised in
Kinderhook, New York
and was known as
"Old Kinderhook,"
issued campaign materials
shortening "Old Kinderhook"
to "O.K."
"Martin Van Buren is O.K.,"
which is where we get the term
"okay."
Thank you, Chris,
for that footnote.
Can anyone tell me
what effect
Martin Van Buren's
election
had on the country?
Anyone else?
The effect of this election
on the country
was fascinating.
CHRIS: Yeah! Whoo!
* There she was
For all the world to see *
Whoo! Whoo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Whoo! Whoo!
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah!
Jack?
Dr. Armbruster.
Looks like you're feeling
much better.
Yeah, I was just
checking the light bulb.
Good.
That's good.
All right, then.
Well, we'll see you
back at the hospital
in say, uh...
oh...
an hour.
Right.
Bye.
Shit.
What we're doing here, folks,
is trying to define the
distance between two points.
This is the formula
we use
to define
that distance.
Who did that?
He did.
Holy shit.
Is that Hammond?
Hello, Dr. Hammond.
Nice Jeep.
Your son's?
Uh, no, it's mine.
Uh, his.
I mean,
I just, uh...
keep it around to, you know...
haul stuff.
It's great.
You like it?
Yeah, I used to have
a '78 just like it,
only it was black.
Yeah, it was jacked up,
had these great ol' roll bars
and heavy-duty shocks,
four on the floor.
Great.
Sir...
This is a complete
overhaul job. I did it myself.
I got it from some chick
who completely burned out
the transmission.
Sir, you're chewing gum.
Oh, yeah. You want some?
Oh, no, thanks.
I, uh...
No, thank you.
Okay, listen, um...
I gotta bail.
I'll catch
you guys later?
Bail?
Good morning,
Dr. Hammond.
Hey, what's happening?
Ooh.
Good morning, sir.
Hey.
Good morning, Jack.
Que pasa?
[BABIES CRYING,
PEOPLE SHOUTING]
Take him
to Ward Three.
Out of the way,
out of the way.
I'll need
a tracheal surgeon.
Dr. Hammond,
Dr. Hammond,
I've been looking
everywhere for you.
Could you look
in on your bypass--
I can't. No, I'm sorry.
I've gotta go to the office.
Um, isn't that
Bob over there?
Where did you
go off to?
I made some phone calls.
I've now left messages
for Uncle Earl
with every tribal chief
in the hemisphere.
He'll turn up.
Or your ass.
So what
are we eating?
I don't know you, doc.
No offense,
but get away from me.
Trigger,
that is loaded
with nitrates.
I like nitrates.
You might as well
be licking the floor
of a slaughterhouse.
Goodbye, doc.
I'll see you at graduation.
Trigger, listen.
It's rough out there
in the real world.
I know.
I'm trying to get Chris
into a good college,
and you should be
thinking about that also.
You're both seniors now.
Later, you can have
all the fun you want.
When?
Well, congratulations,
doc.
You made it to total outcast
in just three hours
and 42 minutes,
beating a record set
just a few decades back
by a young Charles Manson.
Dr. Abrams, call 6105.
Dr. Abrams, call 6105.
Dr. Hammond to
Nursing Central. Dr. Hammond
to Nursing Central.
Uh, no calls,
no visitors, okay?
I'm gonna be real busy.
Testing...
Shit.
How are you feeling today?
"I'm not so bad,
th-th-thank you."
Now, then.
I have some bad news for you,
Mr. or Mrs. Matsil.
Jack?
Yeah?
I was hoping
you could do rounds for me
today.
Rounds of... rounds of...
rounds of what?
Great rounds.
Well, uh...
Dr. Hammond? Mr. Racine.
He's over there.
Who?
Uh, Racine.
We're supposed to see him.
Uh...
yeah.
Dr. Hammond?
Dr. Hammond?
Hmm?
Oh.
Mr. Racine.
Oh, hi, doc.
Hi.
Doc.
What's your name?
Me, sir?
Yeah.
It's O'Donald, sir.
Yeah, I know that,
but your first name.
You wanna know my first name?
Yeah.
It's Mike, sir.
Mike?
Okay, why don't you take this,
Mike?
Subject, age 47,
underwent
an aortic valve replacement.
Phew! God!
During post-op,
he complained of pain
in his lower right calf
and exhibited low-grade fever.
Phlebitis
was diagnosed.
What do you think
we should do?
You want
my opinion?
Uh-huh. Sure.
I think...
I think we should
increase
his daily dosage
of Coumadin
to 12 milligrams.
Coumad... Coumadin? Coumadin.
Uh, does this sound right
to you guys?
Anybody think that's a
bad idea?
No.
No.No.
Sounds good to me.
Okay.
That's it.
12 milligrams of Coumadin.
And don't worry, Mr. Racine.
We're not gonna let you die.
Are we, guys?
No.
No.No.
God, this is great! I love it!
Okay, who's next?
Hey, come on.
You take a crack at this one.
He's got a machine.
Yo!
Come on. Look.
Well, it's
a good thing
you're going home
now, doc,
while there's
still a few kids
who like you.
They'll learn
to like me
once they get
to know me.
Yeah, well, most
of these kids
will be out of here
in four years.
Hey, Chris,
good luck today.
Good luck?
In the track meet.
No, doc.
Don't even
think about it.
Why not?
Because--
In this body,
I can run like the wind.
Damn!
Doc!
In his latest report,
Mr. Taylor made
a similar conclusion.
In this particular case,
the financial burdens
on the hospital
might cause
a budgetary strain.
I believe
this is something
we should all
think about,
and in regards
to the Sudbury matter,
they did find that
the low pyroxin levels
caused the rate
of oxidation
to produce, uh,
sulfitanic goiter,
manifesting the
comprising ganglia
of the lower autonomic
nervous system,
which would,
in all probability,
produce, uh,
solvetania.
Well, actually,
that, uh...
that concludes
my report.
Um...
Uh...
Uh...
Very interesting,
what you were say...
um, what you were saying,
and, uh...
I think that
a lot of...
a lot of good things can be,
uh...
said about the stuff...
that, uh,
that guy said,
and, um...
really.
Very interesting.
Very interesting,
what we have here.
Right?
Great.
Thank you, Jack.
You bet.
Right, now, uh...
well, I think we should, um...
send Dr. Selwyn's proposal
to committee.
Do we have a second for that?
All right, fine.
May the record show...
that Dr. Gilden
seconded the motion.
Uh, let's...
Oh. Now, let's see
what's next
on the agenda.
Oh, yeah.
The matter of, uh...
of indigent care.
Uh-oh, here it comes.
Now, perhaps
we can be brief.
The materials are
in front of you.
I think
they speak for themselves.
Do we have a motion to--
You certainly do.
I thought we might.
Uh, Dr. Larkin,
do you have a seconder?
All right, then, uh...
next item.
Now, wait a minute.
Hold on. You haven't even
thought about this.
You've got people out there
who are sick and dying,
and their only sin is that
they don't have the money
to get in here.
Now, I always thought
that our first obligation
as doctors
was to help people
who need medical attention.
We are shirking
that duty.
Now, I realize that this is a
private hospital, but surely--
Dr. Larkin,
we've been through all this
before many times,
and you know
the insurance rules
are very strict, and
they're not unreasonably--
Will you at least
send it to committee?
We can't send everything
to committee.
Do you have a second? Now, you
have to have a second.
Do you have one?
Oh, come on.
Are you all so afraid
of offending Dr. Armbruster
that you won't send
this to committee?
Well, Dr. Larkin, you are,
as they say in the
vernacular of one of your
indigent people,
you're shit out of luck.
Hey, I'll second it.
Screw the insurance.
Well, Jack,
you're full of
surprises today.
First the gum
and the...
the cigarette trick
and the little fire
and now this, huh?
Well, let
the record show
that Dr. Hammond
seconded the motion.
Dr. Larkin,
it would appear that your
issue is going to go
to committee.
Hey, are we out of here
of what?
Jack?
Jack.
Uh...
you were
a revelation.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, sure, Amy.
"Amy"?
Whoa, let's see
some I.D.
What do you mean?
Well, no, I mean,
I just can't believe
that that was you
back there.
I mean, since when did you
start taking sides with me?
Well, it just seems to me
that if people are sick,
then you have to try
and help them out.
I mean, screw
the insurance.
It's part of the
hypocritical oath,
isn't it?
Hypocritical oath.
You know, that took
a lot of courage,
what you did in there,
and frankly,
I... Well, I didn't think
you had it in you.
Ah, it was nothing.
Nothing, huh? To say that
in front of Armbruster?
It took a lot of guts,
even if the
Chief of Staff job
wasn't on the line.
Big balls, Jack.
Big ones. Huge.
Dr. Hammond,
you're a godsend.
I can't stabilize him.
He's in VTACH.
Well, I...
I'm not Dr. Hammond.
His rate's increasing,
and I think he's
going into VFIB.
Whack him one!
Hit him, Dr. Hammond!
Did you hit him yet?
Yeah.
Oh, God,
I'm getting nothing.
Whack him some more.
But I don't
even know him!
Beat on the
son of a bitch.
Beat him hard.
Hurry, we're losing him.
All right, right now.
Let's move, people.
He's in VFIB.
Come on, give me
the backboard right now.
Stand by with
one amp of bicarb.
All right, I need
one amp of bicarb.
I'm standing by.
No response.
Let's defib.
All right, stand clear,
and clear!
Hello.
Good to see you.
How are you?
Good running.
Good luck.
Don't need it.
Right.
Runners to the block.
Take your mark.
Set.
All right, Rick! Way to gain!
Hammond! Hammond!
Come on!
Hey. Get to your mark.
Go on.
Right.
Take it easy!
Rick's got us
a nice lead!
Don't blow it,
asshole.
Nothing to it, Hammond!
It's a cakewalk!
Get 'em, guys!
There you go!
What are you doing, Chris?
Come here!
Come back here!
Chris!
Hammond, get back there!
Come on, Hammond! Come on!
Just beat one team, Hammond!
Just one!
Come on, Hammond!
Use the kick! Use the kick!
Where the hell
is the Hammond Kick?
Did I win?
Close.
Uh, you dove
10 yards too soon, doc.
You still haven't
crossed the finish line.
Oh.
Hi, Dr. Hammond.
Hi, Jack.
Hi, Jack.
Hey, you guys all right?
Yes, sir. We're all right.
Hey, I've got jumper cables.
Great.
I wonder what Chris is doing
right now.
Hey, dickhead!
Uh-oh.
Here comes
more pain.
Your ass is mine.
I gave at the track.
Just agree with him.
Agree with him that
you're a dickhead.
Come on, buddy, let's go!
Right now.
You wanna have a fist fight?
Oh, you got it,
dork vomit.
"Dork vomit"?
Apologize.
Why? I didn't do
anything wrong.
What does that have
to do with it, doc?
He can
mangle you.
He's only a kid.
So are you.
Come on, buddy.
Let's rock and roll.
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson. Come on, man.
Come on,
get out of the car, man.
Come on, get out!
Let's go.
Come on, let's rock and roll,
man. Come on.
Hey, where you going,
you little suck?
Huh
Huh? Come on, man.
Ow!
Ow! God!
Ow.
Oh, yeah?
Come back,
you little bastard!
Ow! Ow!
Chris?
Chris?
Chris...
is home.
Chris is home.
Phyllis, where's Dad?
Your father
left for the hospital
four or five hours ago.
He did what? Dammit.
That little bastard
can't follow a simp...
* Jeremiah was a bullfrog
* Was a good friend of mine
* I never understood
A single word he said *
* But I helped him
Drink his wine *
Hasta luego, mi amigos!
* Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Yeah!
* Was a good friend of mine *
Yeah!
Oh! Whoo!
Hi, Pop.
What were you doing
with my interns?
Oh, you know, hanging out.
A couple of pizzas,
a couple of beers.
You ate pizza
with my interns?
It wasn't my idea.
They asked me.
Hey, hey, Dad,
what happened
in school today?
Nothing. School was easy.
You didn't see patients,
did you?
No, no, I just went
on some rounds.
Did you talk to Lori?
Wait a minute. Rounds?
You went on rounds?
I gave out some pills.
Everybody feels fine.
What kind of pills, Chris?
You didn't talk to Armbruster,
did you?
I didn't talk
to anybody.
Anybody asked me a question
I gave them a pill.
You lost, right?
Not by very much.
Dad, lost is lost.
I mean,
what happened?
I won that spot.
I'm pretty sure
someone cheated.
Cheated?
What are you
talking about?
False start
or something?
Dr. Hammond.
I don't believe it.
No. Chris.
Yo.
Uh, no, who's this?
This is Chris.
Lori!
No, no, this is Chris.
Really? Um...
hold on a minute.
I've just got to
clear my throat.
Dad. Dad, you got
to talk to her.
She thinks she's
talking to you.
She is.
Yeah,
but she wants to talk to me.
Hello?
No. Uh-uh.
Um, Lori, could you
hold for a moment?
My father wants to
speak to me.
Dad, you can't cancel.
She's your date.
Yeah, but it's our first date.
I mean, if I...
if I cancel now,
she may never, ever
say yes again.
Ever!
Please.
What do you want me to do?
Uh, tell her you'll pick her
up in 15 minutes.
15 minutes--
Tell her!
Come on, please.
Lori, I'll pick you up
in 15 minutes.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh, what a guy.
Thanks, really.
You know, I have no time
to get ready.
Be back by 10.
Oh, believe me,
I'll be back by 9 if I can.
No, no, no, um...
make it 11...
Right.
and, um, make sure
you have a good time.
* She never looked
That good for me *
Whoo!
* I was so secure
* I didn't see it coming
* And she was
Halfway out the door *
* Before I started running
* They say that
love is blind *
* I didn't see the signs
Let's go!
What are you doing?
It's only 9:30!
Haven't you
heard enough?
These chords are all
very similar.
Ow.
It's about... Oh.
You said any time.
Oh.
Here I am.
I've been wanting
to do that
all night.
Me too.
Mm
Sorry, I'm normally
a bit taller.
Jack...
Yeah?
Oh, Jack.
What?
This is really very special.
And you... are
really very special.
I don't want you
to forget that.
No.
No.
You know, there is
a magic between us.
It's a tenderness
and sort of
a childlike caring
that I really need
in my life.
Okay.
I'm learning something
tonight, Jack.
I feel so free,
so unchained,
so able to feel
a warm emotion
without being
compelled
to perform
some mindless act.
Am I right?
Because reality is so much
better than fantasy.
I go around saying that
all the--
Warmth is so much more
valuable than heat...
My motto.
because we could just
go at it, Jack,
and we will.
You know it,
and I know it.
We can.
Yeah, we can, we--
Right now.
Right here,
right now.Yeah, we can.
Just take off all our clothes
and just go at it.
Oh, yeah?
We could just be
like animals,
rubbing and feeling
and touching and kissing
and sucking
and eating...
Eating.
Screaming.
for hours.
Let's just do it.
Do it, yeah.
Do it.
Yeah.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
That would be so darn easy,
but rushing's never
been our style.
Mm.
Ah.
Whew.
Jack...
Huh?
Oh.
Jack.
Yeah?
Jack...
How about a drink?
You got it.
A little music?
You bet.
Whoa.
Too loud, too loud.
It's a little bright,
don't you think?
Too bright? Yeah, bright.
Yeah. Bright.
Yo!
Thank you.
Yo.
Whoa.
No problem. There we go.
Almost out.
Um...
Uh
It happens every so often.
Let me just...
let's move this
out of the way.
Give this a little push.
I'm uncomfortable,
Jack.
I'll have this out in a jiffy.
It's getting
a little late.
It's early.
Pull up
another chair.
The couch.
It's out.
Let me just get this fire
completely out.
Uh, go ahead and help yourself
to another beer.
I have beer at home.
Good night, Jack.
You're leaving?
JACK: See?
And you still
have the shank
of the evening
to do with
as you wish.
Ugh!
I want out of here!
Not nearly as much as I do.
You're ruining my life.
I have got the living shit
beat out of me
and it is your fault!
Oh, no, you've got the shit
beat out of me!
You are screwing up my life,
mister,
and I can kiss
that Chief of Staff
job goodbye!
Oh!
I have had it
with you, pal...
and tomorrow morning,
the woman from Northwestern
has to interview me
to get you
into a medical program,
and look how I look!
Why don't you leave me alone
and let me lead my own life?
You've never let me
lead my own life!
How can you lead your
own life? You can't even
lead my life.
Oh. Hi.
Uncle Earl.
You found Uncle Earl.
He's got the antidote.
Ah.
Oh, thank God.
Well, he doesn't
exactly
have the antidote
with him...
Trigger...
but he knows where it grows,
so I guess we're going on...
a little trip.
CHRIS: Earl,
how close are we
to this carrot root?
Tarot root.
How close?
Real close.
Real close?
How close?
Well, maybe not
absolutely close.
Where, dammit?
Death Valley.
JACK: Is this
tarot root?
EARL: No, that's
piccoli cacti.
Tarot root is brown.
Oh. How about
this one?
Nah. Sand rot.
Tarot root is,
uh, tiny.
Hey, I think
I got something
that's brown
and tiny.
Aah!
That's curler
snake.
Looks just
like tarot root.
Earl, forget the fire.
Help us look
for this root.
We need the fire.
We got some cooking to do.
You're going to mix
this stuff out here?
You yabboes are in a hurry
to get out of each other.
Yeah.
I do have that interview
with Northwestern tomorrow.
You want to go back or not?
Yes.
You see how easy it is
to let school slide.
Root.
Right.
Brown and tiny!
Brown and tiny!
Is this it?
Jackpot.
TRIGGER: Hey,
great going, Chris.
Now, everybody squat.
Earl...
Squat, squat.
Ow!
I'm sorry, Earl.
I don't squat.
Squat.
Now, everybody settle.
This is just us
and the desert.
Let all
your worldly cares
just blow away.
Let the wind
just clean you out.
Earl, skip the mumbo jumbo.
Let's get to it.
This is it.
Well, I feel damn silly.
Well, we're all damn silly
in the desert...
and in the world,
whether we know it or not
or whether we like it or not.
Earl...
Okay. Here we go.
Cheers.
Sometimes
it takes a while.
Mumbo-jumbo. Damn!
Shit!
What does "shit" mean, Earl?
It means
they've put up
some confusing signs
on this highway.
Well, haven't
we got any maps?
Sure.
Here.
Plenty.
Hey, there's a gas station
or something.
Ah!
Great.
Great, Earl.
Anybody here?
Well, let's get
back on the bus.
Excellent idea.
Somebody's in trouble.
It's one person
in trouble, Earl.
Let's not make it a busful.
Doc, you'd better
get in here.
It's the perfect time.
I kill him,
you go to jail for it.
I think I'm gonna love it
out here.
Doctor's coming.
We've got a doctor.
The lady's having a baby.
She's gonna be
all right.
How long has she
been in labor?
Aw, hell, I don't...
Two, three hours,
I guess. I don't know,
but we need a doctor.
All right, now, get some
towels and some fresh water,
Mr., uh...
Freemont. Thank you, kid,
but I need a doctor.
You've got a doctor.
Who is
this kid?
He's the doctor.
Oh, shit.
This is crazy.
Okay, Freemont,
come here.
Help me hold her head.
Hold her head, Freemont.
Help me out
here, please.
Ow, ow, ow!
There you go.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Hang on, hang on.
A little young, aren't you?
Not as young as you think.
What's your name?
Corky.
Corky, is this
your first?
I've got a son.
Good, I do too.
Got the water.
I got the water.
No towels.
Well, do you have
any newspapers, then?
Nope. Nope.
There's, uh, some on the bus.
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Ow.
All right, now,
hold her head, Freemont.
Make her comfortable.
Everything is going
just fine.
Push, Corky.
Push hard like you want
this baby out of you
and into this world.
That's it. Push.
I know it hurts.
TRIGGER:

Push.

That's it, that's it.
I said, come on, Chris.
Come on.
That's it, that's it,

Chris, come here.
Come on, Chris.
I want you
to get around back of me
and watch this. All right.
That's it.
Here it comes.
That's it.
That's it.

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
All right,

That's it.
That's it, push.
Chris, Chris,

Damn, this is...
Push, push.
Damn, is this something
or what? Chris...
Chris, can you
see this?
That's it. Here it comes.
Here it comes.
I haven't done this in years,
and it still gets me. Chris...
Chris... Um, Earl?
I'll take care of him.
There you go.
We've got a boy.
Oh. Oh.
You're gonna make
one hell of a doctor
when you grow up, boy.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, doc, what do you say we
celebrate the kid's birthday
and ditch school?
No, no. I've got
Chris' interview at 10:00.
We should just make that.
Good luck.
I'm going home.
No, you're not.
You are going to the hospital
to make a very brief
acceptance speech
as the new
Chief of Staff...
then you go home.
Chief of Staff of
a major medical facility,
grounded.
Oh, Dr. Armbruster. Larry.
God.
Hi, Jack.
Didn't mean
to wake you.
No. No, you didn't.
No.
I was just, uh...
catching up on
a little shut-eye.
I had a rough night.
So I heard.
You heard?
I wanted to drop by and have a
little chat with you
before the board meets.
I want to give it
to you straight.
I'm supporting someone else
for Chief of Staff.
No, please.
Oh, God, please.
This isn't happening.
Larry!
Uh, Dr. Armbruster,
I mean, uh, you're making
a terrible mistake.
My father...
He, uh...
I... I want this
more than I can tell you.
I mean, it's the most
important thing in my life.
I... I...
I mean, I...
I love medicine.
I love blood.
I really do!
Nobody's doubting
your sincerity.
Hey, look...
I admire the way you said,
"Screw the insurance."
Please, you don't understand.
I mean, Chief of Staff. I...
It's what my father's worked
for and slaved for.
It's all he has left.
I didn't realize
your father was still alive.
He won't be for long.
This will kill him.
Oh, Jack, Jack.
No...
Buck up, Jack.
Jack, it's
all right, now.
You're still my guy.
What? What is...
Come on down
to the board room
and we'll start
the meeting.
What
JACK: Where would
the Northwestern
interview be?
Guidance office,
second floor.
Hurry up, doc.
You're 15 minutes
late.
Run, doc!
It's okay.
The guidance
counselor's office?
End of the hall.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You... I can't tell you.
I'm terribly sorry.
Are you all right?
I... I was sliding.
I was out of control.
I'm Dr. Jack Hammond.
I'm late
for an appointment.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Hi, Jack. Janice Stenfield,
Northwestern University.
I just want to know one thing.
Now, what would ever
possess you to fool around
with my wife?
I did not screw your wife!
I was airborne.
I was out of control.
What?
Ah!
I'm back.
Oh, my God, I'm back!
Oh, I'm back,
and I want to be a doctor!
This is me. It's me!
Yes, indeed!
Here I am,
and I want
to be a doctor!
I want to be a doctor!
I want to be a doc--
What?
What?
I... I want to be a doctor.
I want to be
a doctor.
I... I want to...
Jack... Jack, you are
a doctor.
Yes.
I... What?
I just found out
that I'm not gonna be
Chief of Staff.
You're not even
in medical school yet.
I don't want to be
in medical school.
I want to be a doctor.
I mean, my father, he
wants to be a doctor, but...
I am a doctor, for God's sake.
I am a doctor! I am a doctor!
It's Chris who doesn't
want to be a doctor.
Holy shit,
I've gotta get out of here.
We still have a few minutes.
Hey, doc. Doc!
Trigger, Trigger, come on!
Hey, it's me.
It's me. It's Chris.
Chris, you're back.
Yeah. We got to get
to the hospital.
Let's go.
There you are,
you little chicken shit!
Lori left me.
You satisfied
Rick, I want
to help you out here,
but, man, I gotta go.
I'm gonna finish
what I started last night.
Wait a minute.
You did this to me?
Yeah,
and I'm gonna do it again too.
Look, Rick, man,
I don't want to fight--
Oh, you don't want to
fight now, huh, Hammond?
I'll fight you
with one hand behind my back.
Come on, man!
Oh, are you afraid,
little boy?
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'll fight you
with two hands behind my back.
What do you say?
Two?
Two?
That one was for my dad.
Doc!
Trigger!
Doc!
Trigger,
where's the car?
Where's my car,
Trigger?
Your dad
brought the Jag.
Hurry up.
The Jag, right.
Run.

Position on liability
insurance is dangerous
to the financial success
of this hospital,
therefore, I cannot,
I will not,
recommend Jack Hammond to
succeed me as Chief of Staff,
but my recommendation
is for the man I know
will continue...

ARMBRUSTER:
Policy stands
as amended.
All right, freeze everybody!
Hold it right
where you are.
All right,
now, what is this?
What the hell is this?
Just shut up, moose breath.
Would someone remove this boy?
I'm Jack Hammond's kid.
My Dad
wants to be Chief of Staff
more than anything...
and if he hasn't
been himself lately, it's...
Well, that's because he's had
a lot on his mind.
He's been helping me
with school and...
and trying to get me
into college,
and I've kind of let him down,
but my dad knows medicine.
I mean, he spends
all his spare time
here at this hospital,
and he's always...
always bringing home those...
those boring
medical magazines.
He doesn't do it
because he has to.
He does it
because he loves it,
because he cares
so much about...
He cares so much about
his patients and his work.
He cares so much about me.
You guys have all seen
him work. My dad is a
great doctor.
You should have seen him
out in the desert.
Under pressure, he was...
he was so calm and cool.
He was so together,
and for you to keep him
from being Chief of Staff
because of yesterday,
well, that's not fair,
because it wasn't his fault.
It wasn't even him. It was me.
God, I would love
to explain this,
but I can't. You
wouldn't understand.
You've just got to
take my word for it.
By the way, it...
it wasn't my dad
who was screwing around
with your wife.
It was me.
Sid, read the name
of the new Chief of Staff.
The new
Chief of Staff is...
Hal Gilden.
No, you... This is so wrong.
Didn't you hear me?
Didn't you hear
what I said?
All right, you can leave.
You can get out.
Didn't you hear what I said?
You can't do this.
Get out!
Please, guys,
you...
Dr. Armbruster,
I, uh...
I need to make
a very public apology.
It won't change things.
I'm hoping it will,
because I have been an ass.
I've been disrespectful
to a very important person.
Well, and if
I'm forgiven,
I promise to make amends.
Um...
I've changed in...
some ways and I...
I hope to change more.
ARMBRUSTER:
I'll have to think
about that.
I'll really have
to think about that.
Why?
This really has
nothing to do with you.
Listen, Jack, about
the Chief of Staff job...
Oh, you can shove
the Chief of Staff job.
This is about me and my son.
Anything left on my
credit card?
Enough to get us home.
Come on,
let's go home.
Yeah. Oh, uh, sorry.
Uh, my son and I
have some
celebrating to do.
I'm celebrating
being a doctor
and my son
is celebrating not.
I presume
you drove my car.
You want to
drive us home?
Uh...
I think
I'll grab a cab.
Dad, about your car...
What?
Well, you know, I was a
very forgiving person...
when I was your age.
Hey, guys.
Look what I brought.
Want another shot?
Trigger...
Trigger...
I'll throw it away.
Rick...
I have a little
present for you.
Do you have insurance, son?
No, dickhead.
