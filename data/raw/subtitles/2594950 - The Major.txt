THE MAJOR
Who is that?
- Hello?
- Sergey Sobolev?
Yes?
Your wife is in labor.
Kolya, get back here!
Kolya, no!
Holy shit!
Kolya!
-Seryoga, what...?
-I just ran over a kid.
What the fuck! Where?
-The kilometer 6 exit.
-OK. Let me think.
Shit...
-Did anyone see you?
- No, no.
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.
-So get out of there!
-Where can I go?
-Are the parents there?
-The mother.
Is the kid alive?
Is he alive?
No, he's dead.
Want us to get you out ofthis?
Burlakov's on duty tonight,
with Shepelev and Karpunin.
And Merkulov's on the beat.
Do we do this?
Grab Merkulov and come quickly!
Just the two of you! Goon!
OK.
-Hey, speed racer! Need help?
-No, I'm fine.
-And your wife?
-She's bitching about the car. Drive!
If you say so...
Where are you going, asshole?
Give it back!
Kolya!
Kolya, my little boy!
Kolya!
You bastard!
-You piece of shit!
-Calm down...
He locked me in his car
while my child was dying!
He stood by and watched my child dying!
-What's your name?
-Didn't even call an ambulance!
What is your name?
Irina Gutorova.
Calm down, Irina.
We're going to sort this out.
My baby died in front of my eyes!
I understand.
Please, just calm down.
In front of my very eyes...
We're going to investigate now.
Stay in the car.
That piece of shit killed my son!
He killed him, bastard!
You just stay here,
pull yourself together.
Talk to me.
I was driving...
-They crossed to the bus stop.
-From over there?
It was dangerous to brake
because of the ice.
So I sped up...
but the kid started running.
I veered left and right, hit the brakes.
It's so stupid...
-Any witnesses?
-No.
-You sure?
-Yes.
-Really sure?
-Wrap it up, Pasha.
OK, guys, here's the deal:
No one saw any of this.
Let's get out of here now.
We were never here.
She can't prove anything.
Are you nuts?
Otherwise, you're in deep shit.
-No, man.
-So what do we do, then?
Let's go.
Where were you headed?
Got a call an hour ago.
Nadya's in labor.
Is she in Ryazan?
Yes. She was hospitalized.
And I thought I had problems!
Got it?
Yeah.
We were crossing the street,
and he was speeding like a maniac!
The signs were right there,
in front of his fuckingface!
That asshole didn't even look!
-Do you believeme?
- I do.
Then he locked me in his car.
He wouldn't let me out!
And my baby was dying!
Have a drink!
That piece of shit!
Have a drink.
It'll do you good.
No, no, drink up.
Drink it all.
Did he let him go?
Of course, not!
But I can't have him sit next to you.
Now sit back and relax.
2-17, 2-17!
Accident at 6th-km exit.
A kid got run over.
Send an ambulance
and evidence techs.
2-17, Roger that.
They're 20 minutes away.
Listen.
Sobolev drives from there.
He sees them walking to the bus stop.
Write, write!
He slows down before the turn.
He's doing 50 at the sign.
So he keeps driving.
They're walking towards him.
He honks twice.
And when he reaches the bus stop,
the kid starts running.
Then, he hits the brakes
and skids into the ditch.
How long's the skid mark?
10 m?
Yes, 10 m.
Not 10.
It looks more like 30.
Write down what you're told, OK?
You'll tell them your battery died.
-Can I use your phone?
-Sure.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
I have to call my husband.
What's the boy's name?
Kolya.
Kolya Gutorov.
Louder, please.
Kolya Gutorov.
His age?
7.
We're removing the body.
Is someone filming?
My battery's dead.
Guys! I need help here!
Right...
You'll feel better now.
Easy, calm down.
Breathe slowly.
It's going to be OK.
We're giving her an IV injection.
Take a blood sample first.
Did you hear me? Do it.
-Is that what really happened?
- Like I said.
We need witnesses.
We'll find some. We always do.
What if she starts saying...
She won't say anything!
She's in a daze.
What will she remember?
Sign it.
Listen, Burlakov,
let me talk to him.
I'll get him to headquarters myself.
OK, but once there, he's mine.
Stop baring your teeth, Burlakov.
I'm not locked up yet, so back off.
Or I'll assign you
to a cow-counting beat.
Yes, sir,Comrade Major.
Do you think he's going to run?
-He's flexing his muscles.
-Asshole!
Tolya!
Here's the deal.
They took a blood sample.
She drank 20 cl of cognac.
In an hour,
I'll get her results and we're cool.
Is that it? Done.
Open up!
Vlasov, open up the road!
Kolya, my baby boy!
Sweetheart!
Stop! Where are you going?
Somebody stop her!
Let me go!
Seryoga, are you all right?
I'm fine...
I'm fine...
I'm fine...
What a moron! I saw them!
I saw the bus stop! And the signs!
How could this happen?
Let's be honest.
If it had been my son,
I would've hung you by your balls.
Why did it have to be a kid?
But you're not a scumbag.
You're a regular guy
who's taken two bullets.
You lost it'cause you're happy.
It could happen to anyone.
You've waited for your baby so long.
That kid was no more than 7...
It's your decision.
It's not too late yet.
Let's go to the maternity hospital.
Something bad's happened, right?
Yes, something bad.
Is it Pankratov?
Is Sobolev with you?
Yes.
Here he is.
Hello.
-Are you in trouble?
-Yes, I am.
-What do we do?
-I'm going to the hospital.
Forget it and get over here now.
Be right there.
To his place?
It's a good location.
We can build a market,
a parking garage
and open a restaurant nearby.
There's no need to wait.
Report that dorm as ''unfit'',
and knock it down.
And you,
start looking for contractors.
If anyone complains,
I'll make it plain...
OK, let's have some hot soup!
Let me put the plates down!
I'll doit.
You take care of the food.
Goon!
Have a seat, gentlemen!
Two more plates, Lena!
No, thanks.
Fine, as you wish.
Could you be quiet?
I already told them.
Well, tell them again!
Don't they have school?
There's an epidemic.
Half of their class has the flu.
Come here, kids!
Go upstairs and play!
Burlakov called me.
He told me what happened.
Your version sounds coherent.
But the mother's going to make a fuss.
-Now tell me...
-It was my fault.
I don't care whose fault it was.
I need to know
if your version is airtight.
Yeah, for sure.
And nothing will get out,
even if she doesn't let up?
Nothing. No chance.
She is the kid's mother though...
What if she stirs up
the entire district?
Right.
Take him to the station
and put him behind bars.
Don't let him out.
If Internal Affairs comes,
he's in custody.
I want no shit-stirrers
and no complaints.
And deal with that woman.
I don't care how...
I want her to sign your snow job.
What do you mean, deal with her?
We have dirt on her.
If in court she...
This can't go to court!
Wake up!
Court...
Everyone wants to fuck us.
Inspection after inspection...
They want to bring us down.
You want to give them a chance
to nail the Police Major?
They'll have you all on your knees.
And me, as well!
We don't need a commotion.
Andrei Vasilievich
has elections coming up.
We're going into construction.
Don't rock the boat in town.
If she signs, it won't go to court.
-What if...
-No ifs!
But be tactful, guys.
Otherwise...
Otherwise, you're in for a spanking.
You can count on us.
Stop staring down at the floor!
Feeling guilty?
I'm the one who hit him.
You can't bring the kid back.
You've got your own now.
You've got to raise your kid.
Teach it the ways of the world.
Don't complicate things,
for yourself or others!
Dismissed.
Lock me up,like he said.
But go easy on the woman.
Just mention the alcohol.
If she refuses, let her go.
We'll be dead meat.
Did you hear me?
Got it.
PATIENT ADMISSIONS
Did you catch him?
Yes.
Where is he?
- In jail.
-Can I see him?
What for?
This is it...
POLICE
OK,it's settled.
-Thanks. I owe you flowers.
-Of course!
In my office,in an hour.
Shit!
Get him out!
Let me kiss you.
Stop. Where're you going?
Get him out!
Hold him back!
Where are you going?
Is he back from the war?
What war?
We put him behind bars.
He's been drunk for three weeks.
His mother makes moonshine.
I'm sick of going over there!
We take him in,
and she yells at us!
I tell him,
''Smack her, or I'll smack you.''
I'm sick of going there!
Come see us every day!
-You can talk later.
- Right, sorry.
I'm so sick of them!
Later, OK?
-I've got to talk to you.
-Wait. Open up.
You're free, girls!
-How's Sobolev?
-Look, there.
Did Burlakov come to you?
No,not today.
Hey, move it!
Calm down.
Hey, you! Watch what you say!
Listen. Can you loan me some money?
I need to sober up fast.
Zavyalov and I got drunk last night...
You drank with Zavyalov,
so ask him for money!
Let's go.
-Are you OK?
-I'm fine.
Topolev, get her out of here!
Come on.
Choke on our blood, you Satanist pig!
Go to hell!
May your shameless eyes
rot!
And may your wife
give birth to dead babies!
Everyone to their places!
Let's go.
-Are you bringing them to me?
- No.
Let me take them.
There are people upstairs
filing a complaint.
Deal with them, I'll take care of this.
Come on in.
-Wait here.
-I'm not leaving her.
With all due respect,
this isn't a boutique.
I'm not going without him.
Come in.
Don't leave them here.
Take them somewhere.
-Where?
-That way! That's where!
Here is your statement,
Mrs. Gutorova.
We forgot to have you sign it.
Sorry about that.
-Can I use your pen?
-Go ahead.
And this is the driver's statement.
Sobolev's.
Read it.
What's the point?
Can you let us go already?
There is a point, I'm afraid.
Read it.
Go ahead, read it.
Bastard!
This isn't true!
It's all lies!
I didn't drink!
He was driving like a maniac!
Calm down!
There were signs,
and he was doing at least 100!
He honked at the last minute!
The short skid mark
speaks in favor of Sobolev.
He couldn't be doing more than 60.
It's strange that you didn't see him.
Why did your son cross?
The car was far away!
He thought he had time!
But he was speeding
and my son couldn't do anything!
May be you didn't see the car.
May be you told him to cross.
So I'm an idiot?
Or am I blind?
In his statement, Sobolev claims
he smelled alcohol on your breath.
Did you drink before the accident?
No.
We were walking home
from my mother's.
But if you didn't drink...
how come there was alcohol
in your blood?
Your blood sample
was taken at the scene...
You gave me a drink!
I did?
Not you, your colleague in uniform.
He said it would calm me.
Officers aren't allowed
to carry alcohol.
Let alone offer any to accident victims.
That's regulations.
You scumbag!
You pieces of shit!
You're all in this together!
All for one!
Is he a relative?
Your brother-in-law?
Keep your voice down.
Please, no rash accusations.
I understand your pain.
But don't make it worse.
What you have just signed
qualifies as perjury.
The career of a police officer
with a spotlessrecord is at stake.
An officer, you say?
I suggest...
you admit
that Sobolev's statement is true,
and that Kolya escaped your attention.
Otherwise, this situation
will have serious consequences for you.
I'm not joking.
Think about it.
No.
Stubborn bitch!
Don't talk to my wife like that.
Shut up!
What're you gonna do?
Bang your head against the walls?
You weren't born yesterday!
-Kids!
-You...
Stop it!
Stay put, don't get up.
Let's resume calmly.
I've got all the facts.
There's nothing you can do.
And if you try,it's a small town,
we'll find you.
We'll take it to court!
Go on, crawl!
Want me to push you?
Sign!
Go to hell!
You don't wanna be a good girl.
You don't...
Don't!
Please don't!
If I hit him again,
he'll be a vegetable.
I'll give myself a black eye
andsay it was you.
Sign! Sign!
Come on.
Let's go...
I'll get you in the next life.
Try in this one!
Let's go.
What's that, man?
So, did they come?
Shut the door.
It's over. Here...
What have you done?
What I had to.
There was no other way.
I was clear!
Do you realize what you've done,
you moron?
Her son is in the morgue.
Bad luck.
It was my fault!
I can still see that kid!
Quit shouting!
I did it for you!
Wanna join him in the morgue?
Shut up, gentlemen!
You're giving me a headache!
This isn't a courtroom, dammit!
If you're guilty,
stay in jail.
If you're not, get on with your life!
Going to prison
isn't difficult in our country.
If you can still see the kid,
then sleep!
Maybe it'll pass.
Sergeant!
Let's move.
Fine, have it your way.
Lock up.
-Sergey, out! Hurry!
-What's up?
I said, hurry!
-What's up?
-He's at the gate.
-Who is?
-Guess! Come on!
-What's going on?
-I don't know.
But keep your cool!
What? Tell me!
-Tell me now!
-Her husband...
-Whose husband?
-That woman's!
He's armed, looking for you
and has two hostages.
-Who?
-Zavyalov and Nikita.
-What's the situation?
-Get them out of here!
And make sure they don't come back!
Nice job, Sobolev?
-What did you do to them?
- Never mind!
Tell me!
Two men have a gun to their heads!
I need to know if he's sane or not.
What's he capable of?
What'son his mind?
What really happened?
Same thing as in January!
When that guy was driving home,
you smashed his head against the hood
and he's been in a coma since.
What did your report say?
That a drunk man with a crowbar
attacked an officer on duty.
Galya, get lost.
Stop rubbing it!
It's going to break!
-It's jammed.
-Yeah, right!
You planning to shoot it
or look at it?
Look at you guys!
You're a wreck.
It's not all about dicks and booze!
Pull yourselves together
or we're in for a bloodbath!
And find mea gun, fast!
-Wasn't there a flame-thrower?
- No.
You want him to shoot us all?
Give me yours.
We can't go.
Let the special unit handle it.
He'll have killed us all
before they get here.
It's their job.
Let's not risk our lives.
I don't know what to do.
I just don't!
Do you wanna catch a bullet?
Get the fuck out!
Come here or I'll kill them!
We need a cordon!
Watch out for stray bullets!
He's at the gate.
How are we going to get out?
Major!
Stop wriggling and speak!
He's got Zavyalov and the sergeant.
You useless clowns!
I told you a million times
to search everyone!
There are lunatics out there!
And you just sit here, dicking around,
you assholes!
Go hide
and stay out of the line of fire!
Are you scared, asshole?
Wanna live?
Like my son, you bastard!
He's at the gate. Fuck!
Can't get him.
We're in deep shit!
Any ideas?
You hear me, scumbag? I'm waiting.
Be a man!
Be a man!
I fucked up.
So I've got to go, right?
Here.
No, wait!
We're not a pack of rats!
He's here to kill you, not beat you up!
And I can't go either.
I'll go.
Maybe I can reason with him.
If I fail, you go.
Deal.
Downstairs.
Everyone stay at the end
of the hallway, behind me.
Don't move until I tell you to.
Here we go.
What's your name?
I'm not talking to you.
Get me that bastard!
Calm down, man, and get real.
You wanna kill him.
I can't hand him over!
Don't you care about them?
I give you my word he'll go to jail.
Take your uniform off,
then give me your word.
I don't trust any of you fuckers!
Don't touch my uniform.
What's your job?
Locksmith?
I've been dodging bullets
for 20 years,
so you can eat and shit in peace.
I've got nothing against you.
What've you got against me?
Or them?
They have families, too!
Cut the crap!
Just get me that bastard!
Sobolev!
Yes?
Are you coming?
On my way.
So, guys,on the floor.
I'll get you, motherfucker!
Son-of-a-bitch!
Get them all out now. Quickly!
Take him away.
Comrade Colonel...
Wait.
Don't just stand there.
The day isn't over yet.
Back to work.
What are you smudging this for?
Stop sniveling!
Come with me.
You too.
Don't write up a report,
but come in my office in 30 minutes.
Why didn't you waste him?
I'm asking you a question!
Did you deal with the woman?
I did.
Were you rough?
I did what I had to.
And he came back with a gun.
You should have smoked him
as soon as he fired.
You guys are out of it!
Bunchof kids!
Wasn't there enough bloodshed?
It started with you.
Should've ended with me!
You shouldn't have
forced them to sign.
Fuck you both!
I'm going to jail!
-Are you crazy?
-You're not going anywhere.
Don't get worked up.
We need to get rid of that guy.
Right now.
We'll report he was killed
resisting arrest.
Where does his wife live?
What's that?
Are you out of your minds?
Let me tell you something.
The rat squad is about to discover
a shoot-out and a body.
What then?
A Police Major...
ran over and killed some kid.
Two hourslater,
his mother signs a statement
admitting it was her fault.
That he escaped her attention.
And then the kid's father
storms into the station...
and kills a police officer.
There will be questioning.
And we'll all be finished!
You!
And me!
I was in the cell
and I didn't do anything.
I'll do time if I have to.
Burlakov was your fault.
God you're hard-headed...
Pasha, be smarter than him.
Make it look good.
Look good...
Yes, sir.
Open up!
Open the door!
What's the arrestee doing in the hall?
There's already that guy in the cell...
Pasha, don't be inhuman!
Take him to my office.
Now!
Hands off!
I know where it is.
Scumbag.
Open up.
The gun!
I said, the gun!
Step away.
The arrestee Gutorov
was killed
while attacking officer Burlakov.
Not a word of this
or I'll take you down with me.
I have shit on all of you.
I've known you a long time.
Now get lost!
Open up.
Starkov, Ryabtsev! Stay put.
Take him to the morgue.
Don't step in the blood
or we'll have to mop up again.
You, grab his arms...
-You got him?
-Yes.
-Alright, let's go.
-OK!
Lift him!
Put him on the boards.
Topolev,clean the place up.
-Give me Gutorova's address, quick!
-Whose?
Guess whose!
The boy's mother!
-It was your gun.
-I didn't shoot!
You'll get a bonus and a promotion.
-21 Energy St., Apt.84.
-Car keys and gun.
-What?
-Move it, you fuck!
Come on!
Dammit!
Move it! Come on!
Get dressed, we're leaving!
Move it!
I'm calling my husband!
Hurry, you fool!
Put your boots on!
Faster!
The car is out front.
Sit in the back
and keep your head down.
Don't sit up until I tell you to.
No trying to escape! No screaming!
No bullshit!
Or I kick your head in!
Got it?
Go! Go!
Which floor is it?
Come on! Move!
I'm gonna pound you, watch it!
Mouth shut! Not a sound!
You, stay down here. You, come with me.
Don't let anyone out!
Ira, what's going on?
What the fuck?
-No, no!
-What're you doing?
I can't!
If I see you again,
I'll rip your face off, you hear me?
Follow me!
Hey, dude, spare some change?
- Beat it, moocher!
-Take it easy, man!
- I'll kill you!
-Are you a gangster?
-I swear, I'll kill you!
-Oh! I'm scared!
Stay here!
-Scram!
-Spare some change...
Drop your gun!
Holy shit! Come on,guys!
You're screwing things up here!
Get in the car! Hurry!
Dima, it's coming from outside!
Cover me!
Don't shoot!
Why are you doing all this?
They killed your husband.
Stay there.
He may have left the district by now.
That's none of our business.
We're just waiting out here.
How long do we have to wait?
As long as it takes.
I'll be right back.
Tell me.
Come back and give him the woman.
Tell me more!
Tell you what?
You're an armed fugitive with a witness.
We can shoot to kill.
That's it.
Why didn't they stop me in the city?
To prove you're on the run.
And we can't shoot her in the city.
Too many eyes.
Now,it'll be like you killed her.
She'll be found in some ditch.
Or not at all.
Me, too?
You bet. What did you expect?
Cut the crap and take her back.
Are you going to hide
in the forest with her?
Take us to Internal Affairs.
What?
You've lost your mind!
Do you realize what you're asking?
I'm not gonna screw myself.
I poured her that drink
and I wrote that report!
Look at all he bloodshed!
That's right! Nobody wanted all this.
We did it for your sake.
It's too late now.
We can't back up.
There's no turning around.
Either we kill her
or it was all in vain.
And they'll shut us down, as well.
Give her to Korshunov.
I can't.
Look,
I'm only talking to you
because you never fucked anyone over.
But if you don't take her back,
we're on opposite sides.
You won't make it to headquarters.
What are we doing here?
Here's the thing.
We can't leave the district.
We're cornered. I have nothing to lose.
I won't hesitate to shoot.
I wanted to call Internal Affairs,
but I'm a fugitive now.
They won't believe me.
Unless there are witnesses.
And I only have one.
In this room.
So, here's what we're going to do.
Call headquarters,
tell them the three of us are here.
And tell them what really happened,
so they'll hurry up and get here.
We'll just wait for them,
right here, at your place.
Do you realize what'll happen?
Think you'll get less jail time?
We'll all go to jail.
So be it. We deserve it.
-You've truly lost it.
-I've found it!
Make the call.
You're fucking up, Seryoga.
It's 3 hours to the city,
then another hour to get here.
We can get some sleep.
It'll clear your head!
My head's already clear,
I told you.
Yeah, right! We wanted to help you,
and you're dragging us to hell.
I didn't need that kind of help.
Why didn't you say you'd do time
when you ran that kid over?
You should've dealt with your conscience
and left us out of it!
I didn't ask Pasha to interfere.
Didn't have to! He knows
who's on his side and who isn't.
What could he do with Burlakov dead?
You'd get 5 years,and he'd get 25.
Goon, keep at it!
The kid, the father and her!
What's wrong with you?
Don't play dumb with me!
You know what I mean!
What kind of people are you?
How can you live with yourselves?
Like you do.
If your husband ran a kid over,
would you go to the police?
There you go!
We're all the same.
So keep your mouth shut.
And you?
You've just become a father,
and look what you're doing!
What are you trying to prove?
That you're the only human here?
No, we all are.
Except when we cross the line.
That's life.
Merkulov...
But how can we live with it?
Don't do it, guys!
I'm shooting to kill.
I'll kill Merkulov if I have to.
You hear me?
No one down?
-Sasha!
-I'm fine!
-You're alive!
-Yes.
Nikita, is that you?
Yes.
Are you wounded?
Just a scratch.
Don't push me, guys!
I know what's at stake, you don't.
Get Korshunov, let me talk to him!
Fuck this, guys!
Let's get out of here.
Don't just sit there!
Let's go!
It didn't work.
Go talk to him yourself.
But he's a fugitive!
Don't fuck with me!
It's the woman you're here for,
not him!
We're not taking a bullet for you.
We quit.
Get up, let's go.
Hurry up.
I won't hand her over, got that?
Kill her yourself and hide the body!
Never!
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.
I'm going to go kill
Nadya and your baby!
Do you hear me, Comrade Major?
What a day, Pasha!
What did you tell Internal Affairs?
Everything.
Everything there is,
everything that happened.
Having a gun to your head
makes you talkative.
What's wrong, Pasha?
Is the gas on?
Yeah.
Now breathe.
What's wrong,Pasha?
I'm drunk.
I'll say it was all bullshit.
He's gonna kill the woman.
They'll never prove anything.
You want a bullet in the knee?
Breathe!
I can't.
Fucking clown!
Let's get it over  with.
I've been suffering all day.
Do it!
He's going to kill my wife and baby.
Drop the gun.
The rat squad
will be here in three hours.
Run.
Merkulov is done.
We should have killed her there,
at the bus stop.
Merkulov would still be alive.
Burlakov, too.
And that idiot with his shotgun.
But I felt sorry for her.
What a fool I am!
Hey, speed racer!
Give me a ride to Ryazan?
-Where in Ryazan?
-The maternity hospital.
Get in!
