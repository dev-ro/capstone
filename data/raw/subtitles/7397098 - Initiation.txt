Stop!
Run!
Grow up, El.
Yeah, those are
house property.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, slow down.
- Aah!
- Hey, Beau, Beau. Put me down.
I'm just giving the pledge
a head start.
Don't you dare.
Hey. Don't look at her.
- Do not look at her.
- Bro...
You have to earn the right
to look at a Kap...
- Sucker!
- Did I hear you laugh?
That profile picture
isn't even you, honey.
Bye!
- Bye!
- Where's Kylie? Where's Kylie?
If you get me wet,
I will murder you.
- Hey, sorry, sis.
- No!
- Come here.
- No, no, no!
Whoo!
We got five kegs.
Ten handles.
Sorry for
the interruption, Dylan.
We have a little
disciplining to do.
We got to make an example out
of you, Alvin.
Now, your pussy long face.
Keep that on.
Boys, it's real simple.
Don't talk back
to your brothers.
Back to business.
Guys, in true Sig Nu Pi
tradition...
Top comment.
You guys got to know
which girls are sluts.
An exclamation point?
Yes, an exclamation point,
Alvin.
Two holes are better
than one.
They're better shaven.
Guys, two in the pink,
one in the stink.
It's a stupid game.
We said we'd knock it off.
Wes, you should know,
no one likes sloppy seconds.
Tag the ho's
to protect the bros.
Let's fucking drink.
Sig Nu Pi!
Sig Nu Pi! Sig Nu Pi!
Sig Nu Pi! Sig Nu Pi!
Sig Nu Pi!
Sig Nu Pi!
K-A-P-P-A.
Boop-boop-bee-doo!
I'd like everyone
to take a moment
and find your big or little.
I see you, girl.
Okay, you two are buddies
for the night.
Yes, check in with them.
Are they having a good time?
Do they need water?
Is their ass hanging out from
their shorts
while they make out with a rando
against the wall?
Maybe you should
walk them home.
Yes.
Just don't leave
the house tonight
without checking in
with your buddy.
- Cool?
- Cool.
And we love you all.
And happy first homecoming
to our Kappa newbies!
To honor.
To honor.
If you can't cum in her,
cum on her!
Um, serving redneck realness?
White trash,
not redneck.
Got to raise the stakes, baby.
Beers are for bitches.
Not the pank drank!
Oh, no, what is that?
It's cheap vodka
and artificial sweeteners.
A shit combo,
but a minimal hangover.
Yum!
And it tastes like
a fucking dumpster.
My girl's got such a refined taste.
Hmm. Hey, are you sure
that I can stay
with you and Ellery
tonight?
Of course, but the hangover
really isn't that bad.
Oh, no, no.
My dad's just being so extra.
I can't wait to move out.
- Winter quarter, honey.
- Ooh!
Okay, bae,
I got to focus.
- Yeah.
- Okay, fine. I'm going anyway.
- Bye!
- Let's get it.
- Hey.
- Rules are,
if you're playing this game,
everyone drinks the pank drank.
Not the pank drank!
Hey, she's getting it.
Hey, elbows.
All right.
You got it.
You got it.
- Oh!
- Boys flick. Girls blow.
Hmm. You want to play
that game.
Give it a shot.
Mm!
Like a champ.
Yeah, that tastes so gross.
What the hell is that?
Yeah, like a dumpster.
Okay, this one or this one?
- Um...
- This is what I want.
No. You'd better pray
Dad doesn't see that photo.
- Are you serious?
- Whatever.
He doesn't even look
at my stuff anyways.
But I'm in the picture. He always
gives me shit for stuff like that.
It's just weed,
and I'm the one smoking it,
so I think it's okay.
You know, you went off
on your little internship,
and you came back
a total druggie.
- I'm not smoking crack, Wes.
- Not yet.
You are so full of shit.
Oh, my God.
- Here, come on.
- Okay, fine.
- Give it to me for a sec.
- You just... Exactly.
Just use it.
See, this one is just
so much better.
And look, no weed.
All right,
that was my second choice.
All right.
Okay.
Don't need to see that.
It's just this girl I'm texting,
you know.
Mm-hmm. Cool.
Wes, I actually have a really
important question to ask you.
Okay, one sec.
What is it?
Come on, what's up?
Hey, you good?
What should my caption be?
It's really fucking
stressing me out.
I-I don't know.
Um...
Crack is wack.
- You're such a...
- Crack is wack.
- Dad would so appreciate that.
- You're such a shit.
I like that.
That's really good.
- Okay, I'm going to post it.
- You know what?
I'm going to go get one.
Do you want anything?
- Mm-mm.
- All right.
Dad's totally going
to call your phone.
Okay I'm posting it.
Get ready.
Excuse me!
Yo, Kai-kai.
Hello, ladies.
- You little...
- Oh, I have to pee.
Hey, use the...
Use the upstairs bathroom.
- Oh.
- Sig royalty only.
I'm royalty?
I expect that back.
Hi, babe!
Hey. Oh, yep,
she's done.
I'm ready to go.
I think I'm to start
checking in with everyone.
Okay, yeah.
We, cannot have any transports.
Mm-hmm. Preach.
I'm going to do
a once around,
and we can start taking girls
home if we need to.
I love you. You got that?
I got it. Always got it.
Oh, you going this way.
All right, I know y'all
are going to keep partying,
but, yup, I got lab
in the morning.
Eff my life.
Okay, hey...
Come on, bud.
You guys have
a good time tonight?
You're good, dude.
Party people, thank you so much.
Good? Okay, cool.
Yo, yo, yo,
let's bounce.
I'll walk you home.
Great. Um...
Ready?
I forgot to check in
with Kylie.
- One sec.
- We will wait.
Okay.
Kylie!
'Sup?
What's up?
- Whoa, okay.
- What's the password?
Password is move, Dylan.
Okay, but no.
Dylan, I'm tired.
Is Kylie in there?
Ellery, I don't know what...
Kylie! Let's go, babe.
I'm tired.
- Hey.
- 'Sup. Is Kylie in here?
- Come on in.
- Dude, why didn't you call me
if she was passed out?
Ugh. That's so bright.
Thanks for coming out.
She took one hit
and was passed the fuck out.
- I can see that.
- Yo, you done with this?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks, bro.
- Yeah. You're welcome.
Girl.
Why was the door locked?
I didn't know it was.
Ugh. Wes?
I... I didn't lock anything.
Let's sit up.
Okay, can you put your feet down
on the ground?
We're going to get up and go.
Okay, can you put
your feet down?
Hey, hey. You good, bro?
Yeah. Yeah, man.
I'm going to get
your shoes...
No, no. I got it.
I got it. I got it.
Here, let me...
Let me call y'all a ride.
No, no. It's fine.
Are you okay?
I just don't know why
you got her so fucked up.
- El, she's fine.
- No, she's not.
Just stand up girl, okay?
Wes? Wes?
Wes, don't forget your phone,
bro.
Thanks.
We're going to walk. Ready?
Here we go.
Yo, Wes.
Wes?
I got it. Yeah, I got you.
Thanks for coming, bro.
I think she's gone.
Is she okay?
Let's just go.
Where does she live?
She's crashing
at our place tonight.
Have a good night y'all.
What's wrong?
Have you talked
to Kylie yet?
You mean this morning?
Yeah.
No.
She just came in the kitchen
and told me she thinks
something happened to her
in Beau's room last night.
It sounded a lot
like last year.
That girl.
She... Did she, like...
s-say who?
She doesn't remember.
What are you going to do?
Hey, girl.
Alvin, keep that
chicken head on.
Hey. Hey, what's up?
I messaged you.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Uh, can we chat?
Um, yeah. I got to go
in a sec, though.
- That's cool.
- All right.
Hey, man, can we have the room
for a couple of minutes?
Is that cool?
All right, thanks.
- You want any coffee?
- Nah.
So, about your message.
I just want to let you know
that everything
has been taken care of.
What does that mean?
Beau was fucking with me.
Okay, but I told your frat
not to post that shit
with Kappas.
- Yeah, I know.
- And I was in the photo too,
so that's fucking gross, Wes.
Okay, okay, well, I deleted it,
so I don't know what to say.
Why don't you go talk to Beau.
He was the one who posted it.
- Mm-hmm.
- Seriously.
So, wait, what were y'all
doing in there?
You were just hanging out?
When?
Mm, after the party?
- 3:00 a.m.
- After the party?
I don't know.
I was in bed by 2:30.
No, Wes, you were in his room.
Actually, I was in here.
Asleep.
No, you were in Beau's room,
and you were super drunk,
and I texted you afterwards,
so you can check it.
Okay. Whatever.
Hello?
Give me my phone.
I'm gonna be late to practice.
Are you going to talk to me
about this?
Okay, just give me
my phone, please.
Why are you being
so insane right now?
I fucking knew you were
blacked out last night.
- I wasn't blacked out.
- Oh, really?
You clearly don't remember being
physically present in a room.
- So, what does that constitute?
- Okay, you know what?
I can let go and have a good
time just like you.
Okay, but I don't black out,
and maybe if you would
get off your phone
for, like, five minutes...
Oh, my God,
you sound just like Mom.
Why are you being such
a fucking asshole right now?
Wow.
Wow. You know, I have somewhere
to fucking be, okay?
Okay, okay.
What the fuck?
I could go with you
to file a report.
Okay, realistically,
what am I going to say?
"Hi, I think I was assaulted,
but I was too drunk
to really remember."
Yes.
No, that sounds so stupid.
They can't do anything about it
unless you do.
I know, I just... I really...
I don't know what to do, okay?
I'm just walking you
through options.
You know you don't have
to do anything.
Are you sure you don't remember
anything else?
Hey.
Um, I had to tell Ellery
this morning.
It's kind of protocol.
But I promise you,
I didn't tell anyone else.
It's fine. We don't even really
need to talk about it anymore.
We can talk about it
however long you need to.
Yeah, girl,
if you need anything...
I'm so sorry.
Malik has the worst timing.
Just, uh, give me one sec.
Hey, babe.
God, it's hot in here, right?
A little.
My dad's going to kill me.
What?
No, he's not.
Sorry, babes.
Yeah, I got to get home.
Oh, um, okay.
- Just text us.
- Yeah.
What did Beau say?
I didn't talk to Beau.
I talked to Wes.
Kappa should be prepared
if this gets out.
Yeah, got it.
I can ask Malik if he hears
anything from the guys
- or at practice...
- No, no, no.
Let's just wait,
see what she does.
Are you sure? Because Malik
wouldn't tell people...
Yeah, Shayleen,
I'm sure, okay?
All right, um...
well, have fun
at work or whatever.
Ahem, I noticed you were, uh,
looking up graduate programs
earlier.
What schools
are you looking at?
Um, I'm just looking,
because I'm going to work
at a lab first.
Oh, I see. Yeah, okay.
Well, if you need a rec
or anything...
Oh, thanks, Tyler.
Um, cool.
It's, uh, getting dark.
Do you want me to walk you home
or anything?
- Sorry, what?
- Oh! I...
It's getting dark, do you want
me to walk you home?
- Oh, no, I'm good. Thank you.
- Are you sure?
- I live right behind Greek Row.
- Awesome, but I'm good.
Thank you, though.
- Get home safe.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
- Have a good night.
Okay.
Hey, have a good night.
Come on, let's go!
Solid leg, Moore.
Let's go, Scott.
Go, go, go!
Dig, dig, dig!
Let's go, Scott.
Come on, come on.
Let's go.
Come on, dig, dig!
Dig, dig. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go, Scott.
Come on, dig, dig.
Come on.
You just cost your team
a three-second lead.
Get out.
Get on the deck.
Let's go, come on.
On the deck.
All right, give me 50.
Everybody.
On the deck.
Let's go, let's move.
You want to join us, Scott?
When one of you fail,
all of you fail.
When one of your teammates
fucks up,
it's your job to get him
to pull his head out of his ass
and get it together.
Because there is no
second place, Scott.
You finish up.
Shower! Change!
What's going on?
You got something
on your mind?
Nah, I'm just a little tired
right now, I think.
I'll be ready for next week,
though.
Well, may I remind you
that we do not rise
to our level of ambition.
We sink to the level
of our training.
Did you get that
out of your playbook?
Look at me in the fucking eyes
when I'm talking to you.
This is about Olympic
qualifying.
This is the year.
Got it.
Yeah.
I don't want to see your face
on my pool deck ever again,
with a performance
like that.
Do you understand that?
Don't forget that.
Fucking punk!
Hey, Wes.
Wes.
Yo.
Just get some rest tonight.
You'll show up tomorrow.
You always do. Don't question.
Thanks, man.
I just need a break from, like,
everything right now.
What's going on?
I'm just tired.
Yeah? Well, um,
maybe you should cool down
on all the partying
you've been doing.
What?
Look, I'm not trying
to start shit,
but, bro, you were wasted
on Saturday.
But you're not trying
to start shit?
Okay, whatever, man.
Wes, Wes, no, no, no.
Not whatever.
Look, bro,
your head isn't in it,
and you're dragging the rest
of the fellas down with you.
I had an off day.
It happens.
Wes, it's not about that.
You're acting like
this isn't important anymore.
If it's not,
you should just quit.
You know, I could.
But I don't think you'd be fast
enough to step up and anchor.
Yeah, fuck you, Wes.
Fuck you.
That's not perfect, of course.
Because when I take the slope
of that one,
this factor, this power,
this exponent,
"N plus N" will come down.
Just as N came down here,
N plus 1 will come down.
And therefore,
I'd better divide by N plus 1,
so that when I do
take the slope
and when I do go
to number two...
Hey, Kylie, do you smoke?
I'll take a hit.
Want to see
the presidential suite?
There's a mesmerizing light
that's, like, so calming.
I want to see.
Come here, sit closer.
Come on, take a hit.
Thanks.
Just relax. It's okay.
- You're okay, Kylie.
- What?
- She's such a slut.
- I was sending a text.
She's such a slut.
Heard she slept with Wes Scott.
Did you see the post?
She got tagged. Look at her.
Just relax.
She's such a slut.
Heard she slept with Wes Scott.
Did you see that?
The photo on her profile.
She got tagged.
Oh, my God.
She's such a slut.
Another is sines and cosines,
if you can fit it in to that.
Another is out of the X or...
Your brother
is so famous.
Eh.
The world stage.
That is huge.
He's killing it.
Uh, what are you working on?
Just logging a few orders.
Neato.
Well, um, I am headed home.
Uh, cool.
I'm going to finish this up,
and then I'll head on.
Oh.
Um... okay.
When you log your hours,
uh, there's no overtime.
We don't have
the budget for it.
I would prefer
if you just came in...
Tyler, I know there's no
overtime.
I will totally clock out.
Okay.
Okay.
Are you sequencing
something?
Yes.
A few requests that came in
this afternoon.
From whom?
Um...
I don't remember,
but I could check for you.
No, no, no.
It's, uh...
It's cool.
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
Just...
just hurry up.
Turn off the lights
when you leave.
You got it.
Good night.
Check out this last photo.
It's on fire.
Yo, bro.
Yo. Bro.
Hey, 'sup?
Monday Funday.
I texted you.
Yeah, have fun.
Bro, everyone does
Monday Funday.
Not tonight.
What the fuck
is wrong with you?
I don't know, man.
You tell me.
'Sup?
Hey! What's up?
I texted you.
Yeah. I just...
had my phone off all day,
you know?
Why?
Trying to find some
peace of mind from you fuckers.
Oh, my God,
you're ridiculous.
You rolling with us?
Nah, I'm going
to stay in tonight.
You cool?
Yeah, just tired.
You sure?
I left Thai in the secret fridge
if you want some.
Thanks, man.
Goodbye, my love!
Yo, why is there a fucking couch
in front of the door?
Yo?
Yo!
Shit!
What the fuck, Dylan?
Dude, I thought you were
out with the guys.
You scared the fuck
out of me.
Why'd you dress up
like a fucking psycho?
Yo, can you help me
move this couch?
Fuck! Ah!
Aah!
Help!
I just don't know why
you got her so fucked up.
I don't know what to say.
You should go talk to Beau...
Yo, Beau.
You left too?
We should have cruise-pooled.
Dude, the door's blocked.
No one's answering.
I just tried to get in
through a window.
What the fuck, man?
It's not budging.
Come help me.
Dude, what the fuck?
Who the shit
that put that here?
Oh!
Oh, shit.
Yo!
Dude, what the fuck is this?
Is that blood?
Hi. Miss Ellery Scott?
Yes?
My name is Adam Tahan.
I'm the university chief.
This is Officer Rico Martinez,
Hillsboro PD, violent crimes.
Violent crimes?
Yes, Miss Scott...
we'd like to ask you to, um,
gather up your things
and if you could...
If you could come with us.
I'm... Is everything okay?
Something's happened
with your brother.
My brother?
We just found him
at his fraternity.
He's dead.
Wait...
Um... no.
He... Uh, he just texted me.
I'm sorry, Miss Scott.
Um...
I'm going to call him.
What?
Talking to the best.
You know it's Wes.
Hang up and message me.
- Miss Scott, if you could...
- Umm, wait.
Sorry, just get...
Talking to the best,
you know it's Wes.
Hang up and message me.
Look, Miss Scott, I'm sorry.
Wait, hang on. I...
Talking to the best,
you know it's Wes...
Oh, my God.
Miss Scott,
your brother is dead.
I'm going to call my dad.
I'm going to...
Wait...
Wait, what?
This is...
Wait, no, I'm just...
Let me... Let me...
Let me just call him.
Talking to the best,
you know it's Wes.
Hang up and message me.
I don't want to come with you!
I want to talk to my brother.
We have one victim,
and are still looking
for a suspect.
Please call us if you have
any information.
Now, the Whiton University
chancellor, Dr. Bruce Van Horn,
would like to say
a few words.
Thanks for coming.
Tonight has been one of the most
difficult nights
of my career.
Wes Scott was a shining example
of the university's core values.
He embodied everything
that we want
out of our student athletes.
Hard work. Discipline.
Intensity.
I was very fortunate
that I knew Wes personally.
The university
will cooperate fully
with our own police department,
as well as the City PD,
so that we can...
so that we can bring justice
for Wes.
Thank you.
- I need to say something.
- Oh. Yes, please.
I just want to take a moment
to reflect on what
a special individual Wes was.
Just yesterday, we were
discussing his Olympic dream,
and, um...
well, to see that taken away
from him is...
I just hope
his legacy lives on.
Thank you.
That's all for now.
It really
looks like we could get
only one call
until tomorrow morning.
I'll let you know
if we get anything sooner.
Keep your phone with you
in case Mom or I call.
And stay with the police.
Be strong, baby.
I love you.
You too.
He said he's going to call you
when he gets to the airport.
Okay.
Want to sit over here
while we wait?
Listen, how long is this
going to take?
Not long.
- Here we go.
- Hey.
- Fitzgerald?
- Yeah?
That's my student,
this is my campus,
which means that I will
be in there
for every minute
of your questioning.
By all means.
After you.
- Detective?
- Yeah?
So, Evidence Collection
dropped this off.
I wanted you to see it
before they process it.
Thank you.
Um, Miss Scott,
you can wait here.
There's a little more
privacy.
What was that?
This is my office.
Can I get you anything?
Miss Scott, you thirsty?
You should drink
some water.
Do you have any friends
coming to pick you up?
My friend Shayleen.
And Malik.
Okay.
Well, if you want to...
Do you want to lay down?
I can bring her back
when she gets here.
Okay.
I'll be outside
if you need anything.
Did you find him?
No.
His fraternity brothers.
I was the first officer
on scene, though.
Was he alive when...?
Was he alive
when you found him?
No.
Was it bad?
It was bad. Oh, my God.
Now, Mr. Vaughn.
Beau.
If this is the Sigma Nu Pi
house...
here's the front door.
These are the bushes
along the front.
Can you draw the exact path
that you walked
with Mr. Davenport
before entering?
So I came up
to the front door.
Like I said, it wouldn't open
and no one was answering.
So I came around
to the side.
There's a window
right here.
Tried to get in,
but it was locked.
So I came around to the front,
and there was Dylan.
So you were at this spot
when you saw Mr. Davenport?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Have you seen
this hammer before?
No.
Do you recognize it?
He said he's never
seen it before.
This was found in the exact spot
you just said you were.
- Okay, that's enough.
- Did you see anyone else around?
No, but I-I-I wasn't...
Why did you come back
before your other friends?
Do not answer that.
We are done with the questions.
Mr. Vaughn, listen to me.
Your son is involved
in a very serious situation.
No, I see what's happening here.
We are done.
I can't believe y'all called me
out of work for this bullshit.
Let's get the hell out of here,
Beau.
This is bullshit!
I spent all this money,
for what?
- Fuck this!
- Oh, thanks.
Can you send this to Forensics?
Thanks.
This is a fucking shit show,
okay?
I'll be in touch in the morning.
We have a lot of important
alumni here this week.
Get this done!
One second.
Ellery, I want you to know
how sorry I am about Wes.
You can't imagine how many times
I pictured him
representing this school
on the Olympic podium.
You know that you can come to me
with anything, right?
Your brother did.
Now, get some rest.
Ellery, hi.
You need some sleep.
Let's get you home, okay?
Come on.
Hey, babe, what's up?
Hey, babe.
How's she holding up?
Not good.
Her parents won't get here
until tonight, so it's hard.
- Are you at the gym?
- Yeah.
Just going to work out,
clear my head.
You going to class tonight?
Um, I don't know.
I skipped this morning
to stay here,
so I guess I'll just see
how she's feeling.
- Why?
- I just don't want you
walking around alone
at night.
There's patrol cars
on every corner.
Yeah, I would just feel better
if you were with me.
Well, look, they should
release us around 5:30.
So just let me know
if you go to class or not.
Okay, I'll text you either way.
I'll see you soon.
Be safe.
I will. Bye.
Hey. Sorry.
One of the officers
is here asking for you.
Officer?
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you,
Miss Scott,
but we've been trying to get
a hold of you all morning,
and all the calls have been
going straight to voicemail.
And your parents
even called the station.
Oh, shit. I, um...
I put it on silent.
- Sorry.
- Well, I'd...
I'd freak out too if I couldn't
get a hold of my daughter.
Yeah.
Well, the reason
we were calling
is because we'd like to schedule
an interview for you
- with Detective Fitzgerald.
- Me?
Would tomorrow afternoon
be okay?
Um...
Can I talk to my parents
about that?
Of course.
I totally understand.
We'll get in touch with you
tomorrow morning then?
Okay.
Oh, and Miss Scott...
you have my word
that I'm going to find
the person responsible
for this.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello there.
I'm Dana Thompson
with Student Affairs.
Dr. Van Horn's assistant.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
He's checking in,
and he wanted to know
if you could stop by his office
before he's gone for the day?
Between 6:00 and 6:30?
Can I come another day?
He did say that it was
very important.
I'm so sorry.
Okay.
Um, I'll come by.
Thank you.
I'll let him know.
What's going on?
Dr. Van Horn wants me
to come by his office today.
Why?
Uh, his assistant said
it was important.
Well, I'm going
to come with you,
and Malik is walking us.
And we can meet him
on the way.
I don't want those
fucking flowers up here.
No problem.
Um, the girls just wanted
to do something nice for you.
Come in.
Somebody left these
at the door.
Just leave them outside,
and just come in
and close the door.
Man, I've got a headache.
I can... I can go
grab you a coffee.
No, I just...
I need to get out
of this house.
Yeah, we can go get a coffee,
and you should probably eat
something too.
And what're you up to?
Oh, I-I have class.
I just came by to...
Hey, Kylie, I...
You forgot your shorts
at homecoming.
Thanks.
Well, we're heading
to campus too,
so why don't we just
all go together?
Um, yeah. Yeah, cool.
So your statement says
the last time you saw Mr. Vaughn
and Mr. Scott together
was late Saturday,
early Sunday?
Is...
is Beau in trouble?
Why do you ask that?
Well, they were asking
a lot of questions about him,
and I told them I thought
he was acting weird.
What do you mean by weird?
I just can't stop
seeing Beau
coming from the side
of the house.
And then I saw Wes, and...
I don't know, it just left a...
left a strange feeling.
I don't know.
Last year when Wes got
our fraternity in trouble...
What happened last year?
He's the reason that we were
on social probation.
Beau wanted him out.
How do you know
he wanted him out?
Told me.
Tell me about their interactions
together Saturday night.
Beau and Wes were...
were acting cool,
but I know...
I know Beau messed with Wes.
Messed with him how?
Took him to Beau's room.
Just the two of them?
There was a...
a girl with them.
- Who was the girl?
- I'm not good with names.
I just met her that night.
You were in the room
with them?
Oh, no. No.
I...
I was following them in there,
but um, Beau locked the door.
- Why?
- Does that sometimes.
He just locks you out?
Or whatever.
We're... we're cool.
Are you always the sucker
who just keeps watch?
How did he mess with Wes?
Beau took his phone.
Started posting some stuff
on that girl's account.
We've had some issues
of cyberbullying on campus.
Uh, boys calling out girls
on social media
after hooking up
with them.
It's... it's a crude game.
What do they post?
An exclamation point.
May I uh,
may I go to the restroom?
Or how much longer
do you think this will take?
We're done. For now.
Oh, and thanks again
for your cooperation.
Thank you.
Come on in, officers.
Detective,
we dug these up for you.
Thank you.
Oh, so you knew
about this game?
Well, not much goes on in this
campus that I don't know about.
Like the fact
that Mr. Scott
was involved in a sexual assault
accusation last year?
He had some fingers
pointed at him in an incident.
Turned it into a, "he said,
she said" and case was dropped.
Look, trust me,
a Title IX representative
thoroughly investigated it.
But the school
looked into it?
The Student Affairs office
handles these cases.
Dr. Van Horn?
Detective...
remember, you are dealing
with legacy now.
Mr. Scott is very well-liked
by this university.
I can see that.
I'm going to shuttle
the fraternity.
Give me a buzz
if you need anything.
Turn the lights off
when you're done.
Hey, Rico, tell me something
good, please.
CSI is going to wrap up
in the crime scene
by this evening.
Forensics called,
couldn't find any blood
on the hammer.
- Shocker. Any prints?
- Nothing yet.
And I couldn't get his sister's
schedule for tomorrow afternoon.
I'm going to check back in
with her tomorrow morning
- after her parents get here.
- All right.
Well, keep tabs on the house
until CSI clears.
And dig into these for me,
will you?
Make sure I didn't
miss anything.
You good?
Yeah, I will be.
Sorry, man.
Yo, someone's in here.
What the fuck, man?
Ow! Fuck! Oh, shit!
No, please!
How's your head?
It's okay.
Hey, Kylie, um,
I need to tell you something.
Okay?
Someone accused Wes of something
last year and he...
said he didn't remember.
And...
that's what he said
about the other night.
I just felt like you...
...like you needed to know.
I'm so sorry, Kylie.
- Yo.
- What's up?
So, Malik just wasted our time.
Where is he?
Well, he just texted me
that he's really sorry,
but the coach
had to keep him.
Let's just roll.
Yeah.
We can, uh, stop by your class
on the way.
Yeah, I'm just going to skip.
It's Film Lit.
I slept through that whole
class. You're fine.
Plus, now we can all
get food together?
They're putting us up
in some shithole dorm.
Well, how many
fucking nights are you going to be there?
- The rest of the week.
- What the hell?
It's going to take that long?
Yeah. I don't know.
Now guys are telling me they
want to move out of the house.
Oh, that's bullshit.
Where's their fucking loyalty,
Beau?
I don't want
to talk about it.
Listen, it's a damn shame
the way the school's
treating you right now.
They're not going to get away
with this, son.
Not on my damn watch.
In fact, they're all going
to regret this shit.
Just focus your mind
on something else.
My ride's here.
I'll call you later.
Remember, Beau,
not a fucking word.
I know!
Don't you fucking "I know" me,
boy.
I'm serious. Watch it.
They're going to try
to get in your head.
Just lay low
in your fucking dorm
until I can sort
this shitstorm out.
Okay.
Bye.
Found him in the dining
room, nearly decapitated.
Shh, here he comes.
Yo, this dorm
is a fucking shithole.
Where's the bathroom?
Around the corner.
We all sharing one?
Yeah, it sucks.
Are you all right, man?
Yeah. I'm good.
You don't need anything, or...?
No, no. I'm... I'm good.
- All right.
- Hey...
let's round up the boys,
all right?
Meeting. Thirty minutes.
All right, let's do this.
Has anyone seen Dylan?
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, fuck.
Miss Scott?
Perfect.
They just got back
to his office.
Okay.
I bet you're eager
to get home too.
Follow me.
I'm so sorry.
I tried calling you.
Where's the bathroom?
- It's right down here.
- Thank you.
All right, Bruce.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night, Dana.
- Good night.
Look, I-I don't want to take up
a whole bunch of your time.
I just wanted to talk
about some private matters,
if that's okay
with you ladies?
It won't take long.
We'll be in the courtyard.
Yeah.
Please, come in.
Have a seat.
It got dark fast.
There's no way for me
to charge my phone?
Um...
no, I don't think so.
Again, I'm sorry that you have
to be here today of all days,
but this information
was just given to me,
and I felt that we should
deal with it immediately.
Of course, I will take
into consideration
that you've just suffered
a substantial loss.
But...
can you tell me...
ahem, what that is?
It's just a sequence.
This is an unauthorized use of
university facilities and money.
Come on!
Shit.
Fuck.
Hey, uh, do you know how we're
supposed to get out of here?
The door.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Thanks.
Um, bathroom break?
What a creep.
I really need to leave.
Oh, um, okay.
If you want to call a car,
no pressure to wait.
I just don't have
any service.
I can call it.
Wi-Fi's weak too.
Hey, are you okay?
Ellery just told me
everything about Wes.
About what?
Did you know
about last year?
Not a lot.
I really need to be alone
right now, okay?
Okay.
I'll be in the courtyard.
What were you
sequencing?
It was a DNA test.
For what?
I was seeing if I could match
someone's DNA
to this girl's shorts.
Why would you do that?
Because she said something
happened to her
at our homecoming party.
Don't you think
the proper protocol
would be encouraging your friend
to report the incident?
This university takes these type
of allegations very seriously,
and we conduct very thorough
investigations.
I conducted the sequence...
because Wes was in the room.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I just, um...
I knew about last year and I...
I just really
wanted to know.
Have you told anyone else
about this?
No one.
There could be a lot
of damage done
if these allegations
were to be made public.
Not to mention extremely
embarrassing for your family
and the individual involved.
Have you thought
about that?
I wasn't going
to tell anyone.
Ellery, I am willing to keep
this new information between us.
And I'm hoping that I can
rely on your discretion
to do the same.
You've been through enough,
and this is something that if it
were to spiral out of control,
could hurt all of us.
Plus, we wouldn't want
to tarnish Wes' reputation,
now would we?
Dr. Van Horn, I'm so sorry.
Um, I'm just trying to leave,
but the doors are locked
or something.
Then go out back.
No, those are locked too.
Has Dana left?
Yeah, she left already.
Tyler, I'll be right there.
Okay. Thank you so much.
I'm glad that we're on
the same page with this.
I'll make sure that everything
is cleared up in your program.
Again, I'm so sorry.
It's over here.
I was trying the door.
You ready?
What's up?
I was... Look, I just need
to leave.
I'm trying to call a car.
Oh, okay.
Um, well, where's Shayleen?
She's waiting
in the courtyard.
Oh, well,
let's just go get her.
Yeah.
Shit!
I tried cutting it, but...
Oh, my God!
He fucking broke it.
Okay. Come, come, come on.
Watch out. Shit.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
We need to find Shayleen.
Oh, my God.
Fuck.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Huh?
911. What's your emergency?
911? What's your emergency?
Please, please,
please send help.
Please. Whiton University,
Send help.
Hello? What's your emergency?
- Hello?
- Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
No, no, no.
Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please! Please!
Please stop that!
Hey! Stop!
Wait!
No! No! No!
No! No!
Fuck you!
No! Shayleen!
Help! Help!
Please help!
Stay there.
Stay there. Stay.
What are you doing?
Stop. We have to hide. Stop.
Aah!
I'm not going to hurt you!
I got him!
Get him!
Stop!
It's me. It's me.
It's me.
Dad?
Dad, Dad, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
No! Daddy!
I was the first
officer on the scene.
Forensics called, couldn't find
any blood on the hammer.
No, he's my dad! Call 911!
No!
- No! Daddy!
- I'm sorry.
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.
What did you do?
I'd freak out too if I couldn't
get ahold of my daughter.
My dad's going to kill me.
What did you do?
What did you do?
No! No!
I'm sorry.
Call 911!
We need help!
We need help!
- Everybody, down!
- On your knees!
Hands in the air.
Hands in the air!
Let me see them!
Get on your knees!
On your knees now!
No! Dad!
We need a medic.
We need a medic!
Dig into these for me, will you?
Make sure I didn't
miss anything.
Took him to Beau's room.
There was a girl with them.
I was very fortunate
that I knew Wes personally.
We wouldn't want to tarnish
Wes' reputation now, would we?
I'm going to find
the person responsible for this.
You have my word.
Hillsboro Police
raided the university building,
only to discover the school's

of a terrorist attack.

Police have yet to

Leaving more
questions than answers
on the connections between
these brutal slayings...
I didn't know!
Don't let go!
Ellery! Ellery!
Ellery, I swear to God,
I didn't know.
Believe me, I didn't know!
Do you have any leads
