... And look at your work ...
Better to let go.
Now, I guess you do not want this asshole ...
... To pull your hair ...
No.
Go home, we will arrange it.
What would you do?
First you teach him to respect women.
Then I will do my cousins from here to talk about racial stereotypes ...
... Like to assume that all black people eat watermelon and chicken.
After that he will understand that although my ass is black ...
... Has no right to my notes, as if I do not know.
It is a hard lesson ...
Make him a tattoo while.
What do you say?
Something short, as ...
... I did that I was someone else ...
... To have sex with girls ...
... And then they caught me and took photographs of the tiny bird to me ...
... And every day I look in the mirror ...
... I remember how lucky I am,
I have only this tattoo for revenge ...

When you do these things hurt ...
I want to love me, daddy ...
I want ... I know that when you look at me ...
... Do not see something that brings in a difficult position ...
... But your daughter.
We wanted only good when we were young.
I was ... bad wife ...
... So your mother to quit ...
... And when I saw you, at a time ...
... Was already pregnant with you ...
The other, your biological father had disappeared ...
... But I knew that I was an idiot ...
... I was present at your birth ...
... I am your real father ...
... And you're my little girl.
Come here.
Just promise me ...
... You're a good girl.
I will, Dad ...
... Starting next week.
Hey, Joe ... no, why?
What did he do?
We must find it.
Would not like it when they read the note from mom.
What do you mean if something happened to you?
What is the What?
I do this for mom and dad.
Listen to everyone. I will say a few words about the birthday of Manuel.
Me and my brother did not always find ...
... But I know that deep within my love.
- Happy Birthday, Manuel.
- Cheers!
I do not drink it, I'm not stupid.
No, but you are predictable.
Where is my striptease?
... Have for years ...
... To the maker of all. And for 6 msg ...
Shannon, I'm Kerry. Call me.
What do you think?
I do not know ...
We are all worried ...
Look, baby, I'm sorry I brought Manuel there ...
Never mind, I arranged the ...
Basically, I expect something to happen here ...
I do not know what happens ...
Clear your mind!
What about you, Manuel?
- I kill you!
- I hope not with it.
Jazz, go get a Joe.
You're dead!
Stop! The fuck you! I warn you!
No good to fight.
It was the most horrible thing I've ever touched.
Perhaps the second most ugly ...
To calm down now.
How do I get this front?
Kerry!
- For God's sake!
- I said the other week, Dad.
I love you, Jazz.
And I ...
Stop! Manuel, stop!
Good ...
Kerry, what the heck ...?
Are you okay?
Here you are. Take my keys and go to my car, Okay?
Okay.
Kerry, what the heck is going on?
Not much. Besides being locked in a panic room ...
... I stole the car of my brother ...
... More infuriated my entire family ...
... I broke the window and you ... I found this weapon ...
And the San were ignored.
You how was your day?
Shit!
Joanne: Friday 15.30 '
- What happened?
- What seems to have happened?
Blow of fate.
Because nobody called me ...
... Or send me a message or an e-mail;
Why not contacted any of you with me?
We did not want to disturb you, darling.
- Drink your tea, dear.
- Thanks.
How did this happen?
He slipped in the building.
Fortunately we have private insurance.
Why hit by something that had to do.
He says: "Do not climb without reason."
One minute. It will continue to be paid?
It is building, my love. Does not work, do not get paid.
Links suffered much damage.
It probably means
that will be out for about 3 months ...
... And that is why I want to talk with you.
With me to be contracts between ...
... One of you should work night.
No, no, no, no.
Barry already phoned in to tell him,
it will go one of the two of you.
Mom!
I know you do not like, but it pays triple,
and we need money.
Yeah, well I will not do.
Joan has worked there for months.
So much you love your dad?
Gwen, I am amazed. And you, Joe ...
... When our family was joined by the bonds of marriage,
we have a family, and I hurt ...
Okay, well, well.
I will work tonight, but it will not work tomorrow.
Thank you.

No, Mori, I did not.
I swear you stop? You like fucking ...
... Lady ...
What do you want? We can talk tomorrow?
Not ...
Joe, what are you doing here?
The low intelligence of my father,
plus the fact that he is like a child,
resulted in the rupture of links ...
... And I can spend the entire summer, filling the shelves.
Yes!
Who is working tonight?
Cedric, I, you, Ron, and What.
What is the What?
Angeles, will go down to bring a few cartons of Jack Daniels;
And the runway with snacks wants filling.
I thought it would come to Gwen.
He could not, so ... you have me.
Well, new information, Joe.
Cedric will not come to watch the 1.00 '...
... So you'll need to work all night.
Got a problem?
- No.
- Good.

I do not know it was there earlier.
Look, I can manage the fund, make a break.
Perfect, that was what I was missing now.

Angela, I see license shelves in my store?
There I said yesterday to fill? I am sure that I told.
No, not now ...
What is the fund?
I'll go back, I will just 2 minutes, you know ...
Yes, what I know is that never leaves the fund unattended ...
... And you can not go anywhere with them without having to pay.
Okay, but how to pay, since I do not leave me here to bring my bag?
Okay, go down ...
.. Bring your money, come back ...
... Paid ... go back down ...
... And then do what you should do.
I will not go anywhere if no one in hand.
Are you serious?
Okay, you know something, well, you just bleed on the floor.
Look, I do not care what you do ...
... Just to know that watch.
By watching?
How about a watch too?
I mean, what was it yesterday with the key of the safe?
If you say a word about it ...
I came ...
Go to my post.

I'll call the police!
- Here comes the police.
- Hurry, then.
No more games, What.
Get your shit!
Fucking idiot.
You said you do not like to know.
Would come, would leave the thing, I'd take the money and would leave ...
No stealing the store and do not shuffling!
I would do this if the money was there that needed to be.
But it was not ... so ...
You tried to warn him, right?
And now you can close your mouth ...
... Otherwise I'll throw ...
- Don 't hurt.
Shut up! Everyone can shut up!
And you ... not think to do anything ...
Good luck.
Any idea what I suffer, if they do not go there to go?
It's my friend, I will get rid of.

No, I do not know how many.
I admit that it is somewhat strange ...

Got proof?
To take ...

All right.
No, I will go myself.
Okay, see you later.
Oh, Joe ... should be very scared ...
Yes, I guess so ...
You have a new message: "Joe, I do not know what was going on,
but I think I have stolen life ... "
Diamonds?

This shows much better on me than on you.
Thanks.

Dave is on you, wants to out out again.
God, I should not see me with this outfit.
Well, it will hold up.
Joe still wants to pull out. Jeez, what fun!

What about you? Very worried.
I am fine, how are you?
Yes, just a little bit shaken.
Where is Berry?
Not here. What opened the shop.
I opened all the boxes when not looking.
Yes, and looking ever since.
Increasingly upset after not finding what you want.
I think that is my friend.
What?
What you looking ... diamonds.
What I said yesterday?
No, listen ...
No, we can solve it, not ...
Seriously, get back.
It is your job, girl.
Angeles, take their weapons.
Angela!
Look, we just want to get him and get outta here.
I can not let you do this.
Yes, it's an asshole, and this is not really my job ...
... And normally, it should let you get it and not lift a lid ...
... And you know why? Because since died true my father,
it does Joe.
- "Joe, you make my coffee? Tea?"
- "Certainly" ...
"Joe, you can swim for charity?"
"Yes, of course."
"Joe, you can work instead of me?"
"Natural".
"Joe, give me your last cigarette." Define ".
"Joe, to put him there, tonight?" Of course, do whatever you want. "
"Joe, Joe, Joe" ...
"Yes, yes, yes."
But today, for the first time ...
... I say no.
I will not let you go, you will not let him take ...
... And if you really need and would not let him die ...
... For some shiny stones, which, to be honest, bitch ...
... I do not think its worth it.
- Why I wish I know what I?
- What?
A thank fuck.
For all that do. Even a person.
"Very good job, what I would say get an increase?"
But no, no, I have you now ...
Well, thanks.
Now or shoot us or get out of my face.
Sometimes ideas?
