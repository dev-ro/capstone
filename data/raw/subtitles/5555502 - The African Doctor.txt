- Who? The president?
- Yes!
He's agreed to meet you.
I'm one of his lawyers, now.
He loves me!
Better than that.
He eats out of my hand.
Better watch your hand, then.
Just imagine!
You, an orphan from Biongo,
personal doctor to President Mobutu!
Not to mention the salary
and the villa that comes with it!
A chance like this
comes once in a lifetime, Seyolo.
Come with me, Rosa. I'll take you
to Paris. We'll live the high life.
No, it's too stressful.
Where will you go?
- I don't know yet.
- Back to Zaire?
Never. All my life I've seen
those in power exploit the people.
I'd like to stay,
but I need French nationality.
That way you can watch us
exploit Africa!
Well, I'm not married yet.
Look!
The guy from last year.
- Who's that?
- The mayor of some godforsaken town.
Every year he comes looking for a sucker
to bury out there.
If you go there, Seyolo,
they'll wrap your nationality in a bow.
- Is it real?
- As real as all the others.
You're not French?
Mr Mayor, I speak fluent French
and I did my studies in France.
I'm sure you could get a dispensation
on my nationality.
The situation in your village
is exceptional.
This is ridiculous,
it would never work.
For years, every doctor I've asked
has refused. So...
I don't see how you...
I'm looking for someone permanent
who is ready to settle there.
Of course!
I would bring my family.
Your family?
Of course. I want to give my children
the best future I can.
Your family won't like it.
Why not? It's France!
No, it's not France!
It's the countryside.
It's cold.
It rains, it's muddy,
and nothing happens there.
Goodnight.
I don't get it!
You should be persuading me
but you're doing the opposite.
It's because I'm black?
They've never seen a black person
in Marly-Gomont.
So what? Now they will!
THE AFRICAN DOCTOR
Kinshasa - 1975
- Hello?
- Hello?
Who's speaking?
Seyolo!
Anne! Seyolo!
- It's Seyolo?
- Yes!
- Seyolo!
- Darling?
Listen to me!
- I made an important decision.
- Yes?
We'll live in France.
He wants us to live in France.
In a village north of Paris.
Paris? That changes everything!
You should have said!
Children!
We're going to Paris
with dad!
It's a bit further north...
Shopping! The Champs-Elys√©es!
It's not quite
- in Paris.
- Dad?
Sivi, is that you my beauty?
What about my soccer final?
Don't worry,
you can beat other teams there.
If you're good,
you could even play for France!
Seen many blacks on the French team?
And my friends?
All my friends are here!
Don't worry, Mosquito.
You'll make others.
Paris!
It's not exactly in Paris!
The red light district in Pigalle!
Thanks to you,
my daughter has security.
You can take mistresses.
It's fine! You know,
I had lots and lots of mistresses.
You just have to be careful!
No harm, no foul...
the Congolese way.
He's talking about his flings.
What he's not mentioning
is the depression he fell into
when I had an affair!
I'll be the happiest woman in France,
I'm going to Paris!
Hello?
Listen darling,
it's not exactly Paris itself...
Is that the Eiffel Tower?
- That's enough.
- You lied to us!
I explained several times
it wasn't Paris itself.
It's the bush!
It's worse than Zaire!
Stop squawking like a hen!
And it's raining, I'm cold!
Hello!
Behave for the mayor.
Sorry, I didn't see the time.
Hello, ma'am.
Hi, kids.
Pleased to meet you!
Welcome to Marly-Gomont!
The city centre's there?
Yes, but I'll show you around.
Let me give you a hand.
- Did you have a good trip?
- Fine, thanks.
I would have brought my car,
but it's prettier on foot.
Yes, of course.
The changing sky like this
is really beautiful!
As we say,
if it's raining it's going to rain!
Are you all right, ma'am?
Don't slip in the mud!
I love the view from here,
you can see the bell tower.
This is our church,
it's 11th Century.
Fortified against invaders!
What could anyone want to invade?
On the right is the medical clinic.
The main square!
Main square?
You should see it on market day,
twice a week it's...
Great! Hear that, darling?
- Sorry?
- Nothing...
Holy kamoley, what's that?
- Mireille, come see!
- What?
- You ain't gonna believe it...
- What is it?
There's blacks across the street
with the mayor!
What a jackass!
I swear!
Come see!
The toilet...
Cozy, isn't it?
The house is well laid-out.
- The furnace will cut the humidity.
- Of course.
I forgot the most important thing.
Come see, little man.
You'll like this!
This will help your visits.
Not brand new but she's solid.
Believe me! There you go.
She's a real beauty.
Tough as nails!
Well, I'll be advertising for you.
That's kind.
And...
Will it be okay?
Yes, don't worry.
She seems a bit...
Sorry?
- I'll come by the clinic this week.
- Great.
We'll cross fingers!
- Goodbye!
- Bye.
It's nice...
What were you thinking
bringing us here?
No buildings, no stores!
- It's the sticks!
- It's cold.
- Darling...
- Never call me that again!
For now I have a dispensation to work,
but soon I'll have papers
and nothing can stop me
opening an office in Paris.
I had to start somewhere!
We're lucky to be in France.
Anything is possible.
The kids will go to school,
make friends...
It's a small village,
they'll settle in easily.
I'm sleeping with my coat on.
It's not so cold.
It's freezing!
A French education...
Do you realize how lucky you are?
You could reach the Ivy Leagues
and even become president of France!
As a child, I had nothing.
No father or mother.
Today I'm a doctor!
That's not a miracle,
it's down to hard work.
You have to listen to your teacher,
never sit at the back,
and never talk in class.
Any bad grades,
there will be hell to pay.
Only education matters.
Especially when you're black.
Why is it harder
when you're black?
Go on, kids.
Don't be late for school.
Have a good day.
Bye. Have a good day at work.
Holy kamoley,
the jackass was right!
Holy kamoley!
Hello!
Holy kamoley!
Holy kamoley.
Holy kamoley to you, too.
Make sure you say hello to the lady.
Here are our two new students!
Mrs Chafouin, the school principal.
Hello.
- You are...?
- Kamini.
Go and join your schoolmates.
Come on, everyone in line!
No one will stand
with our new pupil?
- Not me.
- Me, neither.
Smells like poo!
Silence!
I'm warning you...
I will not accept that attitude
in my classroom!
Please!
Holy kamoley!
Holy kamoley!
What's your problem, too?
Never seen a black woman before?
- Is anyone here?
- Yes, I'm coming!
The mayor said there's a new doc.
I came to see.
You did right, ma'am.
Seyolo Zantoko.
Relax...
Relax. There.
Stand up, let me examine you.
- I'll be dandy.
- You can't carry all that, let me...
That's kind but I'm dandy.
Just dandy. Excuse me.
- Just dandy.
- What are you doing, ma'am?
I can't just let you go,
you're unwell.
Let me help you home.
I can manage. I'm good.
Excuse me.
Just dandy.
Dr Zantoko's office,
how can I help you?
Absolutely. In that case,
please give me the address.
The Malenquin farm?
Malaquin...
Malaquin.
Hello?
Come back!
Hello, Mama?
It's Nanou!
I'm so happy to hear your voice!
Yes!
Paris!
Just like I imagined.
The Eiffel Tower, the shops,
the lovely outfits...
And so many people!
That's Paris!
Mr Malaquin?
Dr Zantoko!
We spoke on the phone.
Very sorry it took so long.
I had some trouble finding it.
Mr...
Mr Malaquin?
Beat it!
Get out of my field!
Dirtbag!
Son of a bitch!
It's tasteless.
They didn't have any spices.
At school, they called me black.
What's the problem?
You are black.
Listen, it's normal.
We just arrived,
people don't know us.
We have to make an effort
if we want people to like us.
- They call me Darkie!
- And me Jungle Bunny or Jigaboo!
- Who calls you that?
- Everyone.
Unbelievable.
Stick up for yourselves.
Next person who does it, punch them.
Calm down.
Violence doesn't help, it's for idiots.
Today I went to treat a patient
and he shot at me.
For real?
Yes.
What did you do?
What do you think?
I hit the ground!
Then you ran away?
Yes.
Like a rabbit?
Yes, like a rabbit.
They'll never let me play soccer.
So much the better.
You'll shine in your studies instead.
But Dad...
What?
Blacks can't just dance
or run after a ball.
Soccer is for ignoramuses.
Mom, can I leave the table?
And starting now, no more Lingala!
Only French!
So, what can I get the little lady?
Do you know cabbage?
Very good.
Or I have cucumbers.
Cu-cum-ber.
Leeks good too.
Very good.
Leeks.
I'm not an idiot!
Something wrong, darling?
Hello, Mr Zantoko!
- Mayor...
- So, your first patients?
So far, so good.
Glad to hear it.
- And how's the family?
- Fine, thank you...
Well, what a surprise!
Lavigne...
This is Dr Zantoko.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.
Let me guess.
Senegal...
Ivory Coast...
- Benin?
- Zaire. Kinshasa.
- But I studied in France.
- I see.
And you set up practice here?
That's funny.
The village needed a doctor.
For three years we've asked
Ramollu for a doctor!
Don't take this the wrong way,
but this is provincial France.
People are used to what they know.
I guess with the elections,
any solution would do.
Anyway, for me the main thing
is that we have a doctor. Right?
So, good luck...
and welcome!
Mayor...
His implication
is that I'm your last resort.
I warned you!
It was your choice to come.
Now prove I was right to trust you!
Is there a problem?
No.
No? Move it along, then! Bumpkin!
I was going to give you a hand.
It's true that the mayor
took his time to find a replacement.
So obviously, Lavigne took advantage.
In the end,
you're kind of the key to the elections.
Somehow I need to win people's trust.
What you should do
is spend time with them.
But where?
Hello!
What are you drinking?
Calvados.
Same thing for me.
Nice place.
Thank you, sir.
It has kick!
You're playing darts?
Can I try my luck?
Saquer neddin!
Sorry?
You gotta saquer neddin, kid!
As we say here, you gotta go for broke.
Saquer neddin!
There!
Saquer neddin!
To the beginner!
Seyolo Zantoko, good to meet you.
I'm the new doctor.
Hello, sir.
Seyolo Zantoko, the new village doctor.
Ma'am...
It's my round.
Saquer neddin!
Seyolo the champion.
Darling!
These men, who heroically
fought the invaders...
who sacrificed their lives...
What are they doing?
Commemorating the 11 November Armistice.
They're remembering all those who died
in WWI.
...their country's pride.
Let us now honour them
with a minute of silence.
Look who's here!
How wonderful!
What is this racket?
I think it's the mayor's new friends.
What are you doing here?
We came to see your new pad!
- Where'd you come from?
- Brussels, a 3 hour drive.
Less noise!
It's Remembrance Day!
Pray for our brothers
who died for France!
Uncle Beki, should we follow?
- Yes!
- Let's go!
Get in!
The kitchen is through here.
Why is it so quiet?
It's cold, let's heat up some food.
Let's go!
That's Uncle and Auntie Baheta,
they pray
and sing religious songs.
Check out the class!
- And him?
- Gucci glasses!
Uncle Jacq de Monz.
Mister "Congolese dressologie".
Brand names only.
They shine so bright
I can't see the time!
- He must be rich.
- He's been unemployed for 7 years!
It's time for Fumbwa!
Cheers to the Zantoko family!
Best to stand behind Michel
when it's his turn.
You could try different shoes, Michel.
They make good insoles now.
But I don't want other insoles.
It's just my advice.
Bought insoles. Feels great.
Anyone want to play darts?
Darts it is.
Carrying those crates,
sometimes I can't feel my fingers.
For me, it's standing all day long.
It pulls behind my heels.
For a while now I've been getting
a prickling in my chest.
It bothers me.
A prickling?
Yes, in the inside!
I could examine you at the clinic.
Yeah?
Tomorrow morning at 10 am?
If you like.
This is it!
I have my first patient tomorrow!
Be right there.
I came with my brother.
That's Dede.
Great. Hello, Dede.
Please go ahead.
Breathe deep.
Good. It's a slight cardiac arrhythmia.
It's benign, nothing worrying.
That's a good one!
Go on, show him your thing.
What are you doing?
It's my bum.
- It's in the behind.
- On inside.
- In that case, Bernard should leave.
- Why?
We're brothers, we share everything!
Very well...
You have hemorrhoids,
but also a healthy colony of crabs!
So, what's he doing?
Looking at a man's ass.
Listen, is there something
you can do for my teeth here?
No, you'll need to see a dentist.
All your teeth have holes
and this one is infected.
But I brush them at least once a week!
It's Dede, he never brushes!
That will be 19 francs, please.
Social Security will reimburse you!
We're not nincompoops!
And if I'd known I had to pay
I'd have gone straight to Dr Vinquier.
He's a real doctor.
At least he doesn't take us for idiots!
See that, Sivi?
No way!
Anne, the kids are watching TV again!
- No, Dad!
- Soccer, what's more!
You've nothing else to do?
There are books in your bedroom.
High fever.
Pupils dilated.
Breath...
fetid.
It's worse than I thought.
A case of severe grumpitis.
It requires a fast intervention.
And there's only one remedy.
A remedy I alone know...
It's very effective.
I wonder if the people here
will ever trust me.
It will be all right.
Don't worry.
What if it won't?
At least you'll have tried.
A telephone bill for 3568 francs!
But we never make phone calls!
We make a few phone calls...
Well, we don't call Kinshasa!
No...
I'll contest it in writing.
No, you didn't!
I didn't know the cost!
You're totally crazy!
How can I pay this?
I spend my life on the phone
because no one here speaks to me!
We should have stayed home.
We were good there.
We were at home.
We were happy.
It's called soccer, Darkie.
I suggest we wait
for the different estimates
and decide
once we get them.
I see Mr Zantoko is with us,
so let's address
the medical situation.
Personally, I find it deplorable.
Worse than before.
People are still driving miles
to see Dr Vinquier.
We can't continue
without a doctor here.
You seem to have forgotten me.
No, but the villagers have.
Once again,
I've nothing against you,
but we have to face facts.
The villagers...
I'm sorry, but they're afraid of you.
I recognize the difficulties.
The reason I came here today
is to beg your support.
I know you have some influence
over people's opinions.
If, for example, you visited my...
the clinic,
others might follow.
Certainly spending your days
in the bar
won't help win anyone's trust.
You were lucky enough
to be trained in France.
Don't you think you could
be more useful in your own country
caring for people
who really need it?
Here we're endangering
people's health.
It might be time
to find a replacement, Mr Mayor.
Since it takes you a while.
Well, bring on the elections.
Listen, I know we can make this work.
It's just a matter of time.
Give up and you'll lose anyway.
You have until after Christmas.
Could I get financial aid until then?
I'll pay it back.
Sorry, in my situation
I can't risk it.
The heating's off,
you need to add oil.
Stop playing with that ball!
What did I tell you?
No more soccer!
Eat, darling.
- Good night, kids.
- Night, Dad.
Dad...
Are you a real doctor?
Yes, why would you ask that?
The kids at school
think you're a witch doctor.
They say there's no such thing
as a black doctor.
Soon they'll believe it,
wait and see.
Sleep well, my angels.
So, where's my apprentice?
Here!
Where do we start?
From the beginning.
There!
They play so badly!
Then go show them
what you can do.
My father won't allow it,
he says soccer is for imbeciles.
Anyway, girls can't play soccer.
No one asked you, four-eyes.
Hi, what's your name?
Sylvie, but everyone calls me Scabby.
I like Sylvie better.
I'm exhausted.
- You had patients?
- A few.
That's great!
- What stinks like that?
- I don't know.
- You stink of cow.
- Really?
Or rather what comes out
of a cow's backside.
Oh, I know why.
I treated some farmers.
- That explains it.
- I'm going to take a bath.
Yes.
Good idea.
Darling, it's dinner time...
Have a good day, darling.
Love you!
But Dad!
Kids, get your school bags.
Let's go!
Follow that car, please!
Follow it!
- Faster!
- There are kids in the bus!
I'm going to lose him!
- Turn right!
- I stop here.
- What?
- That's not the school road.
Stop!
- You're bats!
- Don't start!
Follow that car!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing on that?
- I'm working.
- As a farmer?
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't worry you.
You couldn't worry me?
I haven't slept in a week!
I thought you had a mistress!
What?
It's all your fault!
Sneaking around on me like this...
- Sneaking?
- Yes, sneaking!
Instead of saying you're farming
because we're broke.
I'm playing for time.
After Christmas we might have to leave.
Then we'll leave,
Dr Zantoko.
Hi, Jeannot.
Gentlemen...
Tonight I raise my glass
to my new employee, Seyolo,
who had to accept
a job on my farm
due to a lack of patients.
A word of advice to those who'd like
to cultivate something else next year.
The soil around here
is very fertile for stupidity.
Idiots grow like weeds.
Cheers.
Night.
They say he performs abortions.
- No!
- That's what I was told!
He dares go against the word of God?
At the same time,
if God created my wife...
What we gonna do if there's trouble?
It's like we got no one.
Holy kamoley.
How do you know
if he's a good doctor or bad?
You'd have to try first!
He has the same diploma
as your French doctors.
Have you seen yourselves,
with your holy kamoleys and gosh-darns?
You can't even speak French!
My kids talk better than you.
You don't even deserve a doctor.
With your lousy Camembert breath...
Bunch of ignoramuses!
Hi, everybody!
Dad!
Hello, sir.
Dad, this is Sylvie.
Kamini told me you're a doctor.
You can do something, right?
Of course I can.
Quick, come see!
Look, it's so pretty!
Oh, no!
Quick, let's get dressed.
I'll protect my house
against you bandits!
Come inside, it's cold!
You'll get sick!
Come inside, it's cold!
Everyone get mom!
So, my little bandits...
Let's take a look.
I didn't know I had another sister.
What are you doing?
Get out, Kamini!
- Everyone has their present?
- Yes!
- All the ladies?
- Yes!
- Well, then...
- Merry Christmas!
Mado, this was you.
In February you'll come to Brussels.
We'd love to but...
it's not in our budget.
We don't have any money.
The clinic is often empty.
Often empty?
- Always empty.
- People never get sick here?
Yes, last week there was a flu epidemic.
The village stopped,
school was closed.
They all went to the doctor
in the next town.
But why?
That's how it is.
- Are they racist?
- I don't know...
Okay everyone, time to eat!
Darling, are you all right?
Yes, fine.
I admire you. I could never live here,
it's too cold!
I'm icing!
You mean freezing!
I'm cold, too.
Frankly, Anne, don't you miss Zaire?
What about you, kids?
You miss Zaire?
Yes, of course.
It's normal, we only just arrived.
On the way, I looked for Chanel.
I didn't find it!
No offense,
it's just that for us Zairians,
living in Mali Godon
is like living on another planet.
I believe you.
At the same time,
it's rewarding to discover
another world.
Anyway, if you get homesick,
you can always come and visit.
I wanted to surprise you.
- It's a Hollywood villa!
- How many bedrooms?
Enough for the whole family.
And get this...
I have air conditioning
in every room.
Villa Prestige, congrats.
Bought with the people's blood,
money and pain.
Don't be jealous, Seyolo.
You could have had the same.
It was you
who didn't want the job.
What job?
Personal doctor to President Mobutu.
He never mentioned it?
You want me corrupt like the others?
We came here for the kids!
For the kids?
We came here for you!
Because you think only of yourself!
- For the kids?
- That's not true!
It's to give them
a healthy environment!
- A good school!
- What?
Not a week goes by
without Sivi fighting!
They insult her all day long!
Did you know
she got a reprimand?
You never tell me anything!
Why should I?
You already tyrannize them!
Kamini can't watch TV,
Sivi can't play soccer,
we can't even speak Lingala!
You hid the truth from me.
You could have been a great doctor.
Instead, you came here to farm.
So here and now,
you'll make me a promise.
Even if the clinic starts working,
we're leaving here!
I promise.
Hallelujah, Lord be praised!
It's the birth of Jesus,
we're all going to mass.
Mass? No!
That's not a good idea.
You'd stop us going to church?
Let's sing together.
Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon Virgin,
Mother and Child
Holy infant
So tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace...
Sleep in heavenly peace
What's your problem?
We can't sing on Christmas?
For weeks, I've done everything
to get people to accept us.
- To see us as normal people.
- Normal people?
- What's going on, Seyolo?
- Normal people...
Because we're not normal people?
He's renouncing his origins!
That's it!
Not at all! I just want them
to see we're the same.
So I'd rather my family didn't
sing African gospel
in front of the whole village
on Christmas!
- They're our brothers.
- They believe in Jesus.
Our Lord Shepherd
loves all his sheep.
If you want patients,
you should pray to God.
Now what do I do?
I'll need a miracle to convince them!
Quickly, my wife is in trouble!
You have to help, he's coming!
- Who's coming?
- The baby! It's early!
Come on.
Honey, the doctor is here.
Not you!
I said not him!
Calm down.
Just let me examine you.
I forbid you to touch me!
Tonight, it's not about you or me.
It's about your baby.
Exactly!
I can't let you touch my baby!
Hold her hands.
Try and I'll bite you!
If it's hurting you need help!
It's not hurting!
Calm down.
Calm down, Mrs Quinquin.
- Calm down.
- Let me go!
Get your dirty paws off me!
Don't touch me!
Please, honey...
It's a breech birth.
- We need a hospital!
- There's no time.
She could haemorrhage.
I need hot water,
soap and another towel.
You're gonna deliver me?
Yes. Like it or not,
tonight we're a team.
No, never! Vamoose!
Calm down!
Your life and that of your baby
are at stake!
Do you hear me?
Here, doctor.
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
Here.
No, it's not the moment!
- Okay?
- I guess.
I'm used to this with animals but...
Are you ready?
On the count of three, push.
I hate you!
One, two and three!
Rapscallion!
Yes, that's good!
- Buffoon!
- Very good, push!
Again!
Blazing imbecile!
That's right!
Think of me!
Go on! Now saquer neddin!
What'd you say?
Saquer neddin.
- Go on.
- Okay.
I'm gonna saquer neddin!
Push, push!
There!
Put your hand on her stomach.
Now push, push...
And relax!
Breathe!
Two, three... Push!
And breathe!
That's good, very good.
Push, push! Don't let up!
Push!
- Here.
- Thank you...
My little love.
- He's beautiful.
- Yes!
Oh, my baby!
Thank you.
I couldn't have done it alone.
You both did great.
Sorry about before.
Don't worry about it.
What will you call him?
Isn't Felix beautiful?
Maybe we should
throw some ice on your wife!
Mr Mayor...
This is for you!
This is for you, my friend!
- Three cheers for Seyolo!
- Hooray!
- Bye, Doctor.
- Get home safe, Doctor.
Bye!
Dad, did you hear?
They called you doctor!
Hello?
An appointment... for a consultation?
Yes, certainly! Let me see...
What would suit you?
Yes, that works.
And your name?
Is it open?
Certainly. Come in.
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.
Doctor?
Doctor, the pills...
- On an empty stomach?
- Yes.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
I'm sick of this medication.
Then let's stop it.
But in exchange, you must walk
five times round the garden every day.
And start gardening again.
You can bring me flowers.
It's men who should bring flowers.
That's it, people are coming!
He's happy,
he's got his confidence back.
Then in Brussels it will be easier.
In fact, Mado, did you send me the ads?
I can't wait to come and see it!
Yes, I'm getting my license.
Of course I can drive!
First gear.
Shift, Mrs Zantoko! Shift!
- But I'm shifting!
- No, you're not!
That's what I'm doing!
You're braking! It's the other pedal!
Now accelerate!
Go on, Mrs Zantoko.
Shift!
- Gently release the pedal.
- I'm moving!
Yes, that's the point of a car!
Forward, forward!
There, like that.
Can I be honest with you?
This will take a while.
If you've lost all your medical bills,
it's going to be hard.
Well, they must be in there.
Look properly.
I don't understand why you've waited
so long to register.
I don't understand their stuff.
Here, there's this too.
- A little glass of wine?
- No, thanks.
Looks like the mayor won his play.
I'd never have bet on that black.
He's very nice.
My wife went to see him,
she found him charming.
It's intolerable!
We're talking about an African doctor!
It's a disgrace to French medicine.
We have to do something,
the elections are soon.
We need information on this guy.
Cupcake, we'll serve the drinks inside.
It's about to rain.
Come on, everyone inside!
Hello?
I'll be right there.
More energy!
Lavigne, I can't hear you count!
Mathilde!
Go on!
OK, good.
Those wanting to play soccer
get into teams.
The others come with me,
we'll jump rope.
Get a move on!
Hang on, guys.
Wanna play soccer?
Yeah, okay.
Whatcha doing?
Get lost.
We'll take you all on.
We have a match to play.
You scared?
Darkie really wants a beating!
Claude? It's Bernard.
Get to the school right now!
Hurry!
Go on, Sivi!
When you have two left feet
you're better off jumping rope.
Go again, Sivi!
I always knew you'd do it.
Since the first day I saw you
in the bar, remember?
You must be so proud
of your husband.
Yes, but I can't say it
or it'll go to his head!
I always trusted him.
And now he's proved himself,
I'm sure that in a big city
nothing will be able to stop him.
We'll probably move to Brussels.
You haven't told her?
- What?
- One more reason to toast.
There are still a few formalities
to settle,
but your husband will have
French nationality in a few days.
No, really?
So he'll be able to set up
his own clinic here in Marly-Gomont.
You accepted this offer?
- Naturally!
- Of course.
Excuse me, I have to go.
- Darling...
- Don't touch me!
Mom, where are you going?
Auntie Selipa is ill,
she needs me.
You'll stay with dad, okay?
Come on.
See you next week, my darlings.
Be good.
How will I manage
both work and the kids?
If you stay here,
you'll need to take them sometimes.
Darn, I forgot my checkbook.
Sorry?
I forgot my checkbook.
It's fine.
You can settle next time.
Mr Zantoko?
Yes...
Come with us to the station.
You're under arrest.
Sorry, the clinic
is closed until further notice.
Regarding transport,
I will go in person
to lobby the regional council
for a more frequent bus service.
Because if we want to modernize Marly,
we need to give its residents
the means to get around.
Regarding the Bastille Day ball,
I suggest...
Excuse me.
Oh, no!
Sorry, I...
I have just learned that Dr Zantoko
has been arrested.
He can no longer practice in France.
So once again,
we have no doctor.
Hang on,
we agree this situation
is unacceptable.
Once again, our sorry mayor
has proven his irresponsibility,
and we're paying the price!
Tomorrow I will meet with him
to offer, through my connections,
a lasting solution!
You can't play
with the townspeople's health!
At least I don't want to play!
How is this possible?
His dispensation from the Health Ministry
was suspended.
Suspended?
Just like that, with no warning?
Just days
from him getting French nationality?
The application wasn't completed.
- What's the issue?
- Mr Zantoko is an orphan,
so they require proof
of his birth nationality.
How long will it take?
Probably a few weeks.
What will happen in the meantime?
He's free to go, but he can't work
until this is sorted out.
This is the waiting room,
and the office.
You're here, Seyolo.
- This is Dr Grenier.
- Hello.
It's a bit basic,
but we'll make do.
If you have any questions
for Dr Zantoko...
No, thank you, that's fine.
He left. I asked him to wait
but he refused.
- Where did he go?
- That way.
Where are you going?
Hey, Jeannot!
- What's going on?
- I'm walking!
Who's with the kids?
They're with themselves,
they don't need me. No one does.
Not even my wife needs me.
- Come on, I'll take you home.
- Not a chance!
Where are you going?
Come back!
Don't be ridiculous!
I am ridiculous!
I did all I could to be accepted.
And for what?
It's true, I renounced my origins!
Me, the orphan from Biongo.
Gently...
Gently, now.
Don't move...
I'm going...
I'm gone...
I'm gone.
Gently, now.
Mommy!
I'm gonna die!
You sure you want to see the match?
There's no reason I shouldn't take you
to a game, at least.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
Well done, Doctor.
The child is fine, now.
It's thanks to you, Doctor.
It's terrible what's happening!
You're our best doctor ever
and they won't let you work!
If you want a chance to get me back,
vote Ramollu tomorrow.
You know the kids have prepared
a show for the occasion.
So we expect to see you there...
and your wife.
Yes, of course.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Where's Sivi?
She ran into a friend, she's coming.
A friend?
"He" really has
a magnificent kick.
Who?
Who!
Who!
What's she doing?
She'll miss the start!
Go, Sivi!
That's okay, Sivi!
You're gonna score!
Sivi the Black Panther
Well played, son.
Nice goal!
Well done, Sivi!
That's my daughter!
Thanks to her,
we've made the minor league!
It's beautiful!
Enough, enough.
Mado? It's Seyolo.
Is Anne there?
No, she's gone out.
Well, tell her that Sivi
is an amazing soccer player!
She scored four goals.
She crushed them!
If only she'd seen it...
Mado?
Tell her I can't work
at the clinic anymore.
What?
It's too long to explain.
And please...
tell her I apologize.
That I'm sorry.
And that I hope...
I'll see her tomorrow.
Okay? It's important!
Okay.
It's important.
Thanks.
Municipal Elections
Marly Voting Station
Ready, kids?
Then let's go.
Hey, it's our champion!
How's things?
Congrats for yesterday!
Drinks are on the house!
In that case, three lemonades.
Move over!
So, it's the big day?
You're not going to vote?
For all the good it does!
Either way, Ramollu's in a pickle!
The main thing is how you're doing.
Not too sore today?
No, I'm okay.
Next week is against Nouvion.
We're counting on you.
But unfortunately,
we won't be here next week.
What?
We're leaving the village.
- What?
- What are you talking about?
I can't work here,
so I need to go elsewhere.
Sivi won't be on the team anymore?
No.
Don't worry.
You'll play on another local team.
If only there hadn't been
this election...
Since the mayor managed
to get a local doctor,
Lavigne has tried to stop me working.
- There must be a solution but...
- What?
Exactly, what?
We'll vote for Ramollu!
If we keep the mayor,
he'll support us.
That could help.
Well, we have to go.
The kids have a show.
Come on.
- You'll be there, I guess?
- Yes!
After the vote.
- Yes!
- See you later.
- What vote?
- We goin' voting!
- We gotta vote!
- Hang on!
I ain't never voted!
- Did I look disappointed enough?
- You were perfect, darling.
- Are we really moving?
- For now pretend we are.
Hello, Mr Gaillard.
Hello!
Sivi wanted to say goodbye to you.
Thank you.
With all my heart.
I'll always be grateful
for your trust
by taking me on the Marly team.
You're leaving us?
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for this turnout.
The voting station
won't open until 10 am.
So, a little patience...
Mr Mayor.
Why are they all so early?
- Are you okay?
- Yes, why?
- I don't know, you seem strange.
- No.
It's since we decided to leave.
Mom!
Hello.
As everyone seems to have voted,
I think we can start.
One small precision.
Everything you'll see
was imagined and conceived
by the children themselves:
This magnificent set,
the wonderful costumes,
and of course the beautiful story.
Please enjoy the show.
Arrest him!
I think we might have
the election results.
No?
I never knew if it was our play
that did it.
But if it was,
I think it's a fitting turnaround
when children can help their parents.
Soon afterwards,
the Marlysians got mobilized.
Now we can live to be old.
They signed a petition
asking for Dr Seyolo Zantoko
to obtain French nationality.
That's how we stayed in Marly.
In fact, my father soon
had to hire a secretary.
And not just anyone...
Dr Zantoko's office, can I help you?
My mother quickly found her place.
People even came without an appointment.
She had her ways
to instill customer loyalty
and motivate the boss.
Did someone say donut?
What took you so long!
My parents remained loyal to Marly
for the rest of their lives.
And even if every night
my mother barely slept...
over time,
they became inseparable.
Like my father and his patients,
who he cared for
until his dying day.
At his funeral,
when I saw his patients arrive...
it was like he'd given us all
the same appointment.
This last appointment
was proof
of what he always wanted...
something that had transformed
into love.
A simple love
that said here,
we were at home.
Isn't it beautiful?
Seyolo Zantoko died on August 30, 2009
from a car accident.
In 2008, he received the medal of merit
for service to Picardy.
Anne finally achieved her dream
of living in Brussels,
near the Matonge district
not far from her cousins.
Sivi and Kamini both got nursing degrees.
Sivi practices in Brussels.
Kamini is now a comedian in Lille.
In 2006,
he made his childhood village famous
with his Internet hit Marly-Gomont.
