Who are you angry at?
Everyone.
Everything.
What do you do
when you get angry?
I pipe up!
Fuck my lungs with smog.
Do you have an outlet
to release this anger if you...
- can't get high?
- No.
I want to lash out.
Release this...
this deep fucking hate
I have for everyone,
everything!
Just to fucking purge
all this shit that eats me up!
"Purge."
Interesting term.
You may have a chance
to purge soon.
Unemployment rising
across the nation.
Stock market down
another 2,000 points
in the largest drop
in its history.
A subprime mortgage
crisis worse than 2008.
Neighborhoods
across the country
destroyed by
an opioid epidemic.
Protests across the nation.
Americans are looking
for a necessary change
in these tumultuous times.
Citizens
growing angry as they face
a collapsing economy.
A new party is arising
as a substitute to
the Republicans and Democrats,
calling themselves the New
Founding Fathers of America.
The New Founding Fathers
rising in polls with
the NRA now endorsing them
and supporting them
financially
with large donations
to the NFFA war chest.
Can the NFFA seize control?
Will Americans fall
for their fear mongering?
As your elected president,
with my fellow
New Founding Fathers,
we make this promise.
We will revive this country.
The American dream is dead.
We will do whatever it takes
to let you dream again.
USA! USA!
We are now only days from this
controversial experiment,
this night of legalized crime
that people are now
calling the Purge.
And there are protests
all over.
Conflict between
anti-Purge protesters
and Purge supporters broke out
early today in North Carolina.
Yes, Susan,
I'm here in Charlotte.
There's been about
20 arrests so far,
and we'll keep you informed
as protests
are continuing.
Staten Island, the chosen site,
has become the focus
for the entire world.
We have reporters
across the island
who will be giving live updates
for the next several days.
Let's go now to correspondent
Van Jones, who's in Park Hill.
Yes, James. I'm here
outside the Park Hill Towers,
a low-income housing project,
and I can see citizens are...
Isaiah, our tower
made the news.
Are you serious?
Goddamn it.
Dolores. Good morning.
Have you seen Tony?
My sink is leaking again.
Good morning, sweetie.
I'm so sick of this
piece of shit building.
The damn elevator's
down again, too.
As bad as my asthma is, got me
sweating like a fucking snitch.
We need five or six supers
in this raggedy motherfucker.
I'll let him know what's up
if I see him.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sweetie.
Hey.
This bullshit experiment
really happening, Ny?
- Talk to you later, okay?
- All right, sweetie.
The Pope has continued
his condemnation of the Purge.
And France's president,
Lemercier, has called upon...
I'll see you later, bro.
I'm out.
- I'll see you tonight.
- A'ight.
...if the NFFA
doesn't stop this, quote,
"barbaric experiment."
Locally, protestors
have started to gather
at the evaluation sites,
as well as outside
local government offices.
So far,
there has been no sign
of violence,
but tensions are high
as the clock ticks.
Are you an angry person?
Who ain't?
Just tell me what I need to do
to get paid.
If you remain on Staten Island
during the experiment,
you will receive monetary
compensation of $5,000.
You'll give me $5,000
just to stay home
during this thing?
How would you know if I stayed?
We would implant
a tracking device in your arm.
Not harmful.
And if you decide
to participate beyond that,
there would be
further compensation.
What do you mean,
"participate"?
Go out, release your anger.
You mean kill someone?
If you feel compelled.
Okay. Let's do this.
I need the money.
Let's go to our News Four
on-the-scene reporter
at the Park Hill Towers.
This is one of a dozen sites
being set up across the island
where citizens are signing up
to participate
in the experiment.
They are also being
psychologically evaluated here
to determine
their mental status
before they purge.
And they will be
evaluated again
after the experiment,
if they survive,
to see how they
were affected by the night
that is being described
as a "societal catharsis."
Are you angry?
Damn straight.
People around here been making
fun of us our whole lives.
We keep to ourselves, but they
just won't leave us alone.
Are you ever inclined
to hurt someone?
What do you think, Doc?
The island was chosen
because its demographic
is a perfect representation...
There are numerous
drug and street gangs
on Staten Island.
Many are wondering
if they'll participate.
Many citizens are leaving.
For those staying,
the financial reward
seems to be the incentive.
Despite the weather conditions,
the protesters are out.
They have their signs,
and their fists are raised.
They are against the Purge
experiment that is happening.
This is wrong!
Do not purge! Do not purge!
Walk away from their money!
Do not purge!
Do not participate!
Do not purge!
Do not participate!
So we are here
with Arlo Sabian.
He is the chief of staff
for the NFFA.
He got this whole thing
pushed through Congress.
Well, you got protests
all over the place now.
Please. The idea of the Purge
was analyzed for years.
We allowed island citizens
to vote on participation.
- They voted yes.
- Yeah, and you know why?
Because a lot of those people
felt coerced by the fact
they don't have money
and you're offering money.
So, what do you say
to the lower-income people
who are out here
risking their lives tonight?
Well, Van, as with
any scientific trial,
those who participate
receive payment.
You know, I'm gonna turn
to you, Dr. Updale.
You are the behavioral
scientist
who actually came up
with this whole experiment.
A lot of people have
a lot of concerns about this,
and one concern comes up
over and over again.
I want the truth from you.
Is the Purge
a political device?
I do not work for the NFFA.
I did not conceive
of the experiment for them.
The NFFA had the courage
to test it,
but the conceit
is not a political one.
It is a psychological one.
The benefit of acting violently
without worry of consequence,
- that's a freeing violence.
- "A freeing violence."
Okay, that's a...
that's a new one on me.
I have a question for you.
What is your definition
of success?
Well, the level
of participation
in certain areas is key.
Uh, the Park Hill Towers,
for example,
are the center
of this community.
If there's considerable
participation there,
I think that'll be
a strong indication
that this night
is a great success.
- Well, we'll see.
- They have monetized
- and incentivized murder.
- Yeah!
- Walk away from their money!
- Yeah!
The wealthy areas
are already clearing,
but the NFFA knew that we,
"the impoverished,"
would stay if there
was monetary gain.
This is another way
to keep the brown
and black people down!
Yes!
Do not purge!
Do not participate!
Do not purge!
Do not participate!
Do not purge!
Look at all of this.
Everybody want to be
a gangster.
You really think
these regular folk
gonna pop each other like
gangsters when the time comes?
Shit yeah. People pissed.
They ain't got no money.
They ain't got no food.
- They gotta release their anger.
- Bullshit.
They participate,
it'll be for that paper.
- Trust me.
- Nah.
People gonna riot.
They gonna steal,
act like clowns and all that,
but there ain't gonna be
that much killing.
Nah, killing comes
from the heart, B.
- Yeah.
- A damaged heart.
These people, they don't got
that type of damage.
Do not participate!
Do not purge!
- Believe me.
- Do not participate!
Do not purge!
Do not participate!
- Do not purge!
- D!
You come to see the show?
OG.
All three of you old men
out today?
What's the occasion? Am I...
Am I the luckiest man
in the world?
Three kings at your service.
Nah, we the Three Wise Men.
Man, who are you fuckers
kidding?
We the Three Stooges
on our best day.
Moe, Larry, Jheri curl.
What you think
about all this here, Fred?
Oh, man.
Look here.
This is the greatest shit show
on Earth.
They turning our island
into ancient Rome.
Our hood into the Colosseum.
Now, the question is:
Are we gonna be the Christians
or the lions?
Gladiators or the slaves,
right?
Stay safe, Three.
If you need anything...
We three okay, man.
We done seen it all
and then some.
We three, we've been
through some shit.
Y'all be easy.
Hey, tough guy.
You here to participate
or protest?
Still fighting
the good fight, woman?
Fighting the only fight.
Oh, I see.
No cops, no law.
Sounds like a dream come true
for a man in your business.
You got me wrong
on this one, Ny.
I don't like it.
Why not?
I don't know what it is.
When I don't know
exactly what something is...
I don't trust it.
Not one bit.
Keep it moving, man.
Hey, yo, pocket that money
quick, son.
And then send these niggas
on their way, a'ight?
Man, listen.
We one of Dmitri's top corners
'cause we keep shit moving.
A'ight.
Let's go, man.
Isaiah.
Your sister know you here?
You're better than this, son.
Come by the shop,
you want a job.
The fuck you doing, man?
You got a customer.
The customer.
The-the one and only.
What you need, Skeletor?
Mmm, yeah, I smell your sweat.
Innocent Isaiah just...
fresh-fresh.
What the fuck
you talking about, nigga?
Ah, you green.
Our first transaction's
on you, hmm?
A little initiation fee
to get my biz
with your fine-ass sister.
Hey, yo, fuck you, fiend.
Move on.
Get the fuck out
of my face, man.
A blood baptism for Innocent I.
Sure enough.
See, that's what
the doctor ordered.
And I'm the practicing
practitioner!
Yo, hold up, hold up.
Yo, yo! Yo, we out!
Hey, yo, clear out, yo!
Hey, yo, come on, Isaiah.
Come on.
- Come on.
- He cut me, man.
For real?
I called y'all here
to discuss this experiment.
I don't give a shit what other
people do during Purge night.
I care about what you all do.
You get hurt or you die,
I lose money.
- And I don't lose money.
- Word. Word.
- And we got enemies, right?
- Yeah, true.
Niggas might use the night
to make a move on us.
Maybe the police
might use the night
to take out motherfuckers
like us.
Who knows?
Point is, we gotta
be prepared for anything.
So we lay low.
We stay inside, and we protect
- what needs protecting.
- Word. - That's what's up.
Our kin, our skin,
our product and our money.
Yo, D. We should all
just go to Brooklyn.
You know what I mean?
So we don't even take a chance.
Nah.
Nah, we can't move our money
or our stash off the island.
It's too risky.
- And it'll make us look weak.
- Come on, my G.
This is bullshit.
I want to fucking purge, man.
I want to tear shit up
and have some fucking fun.
For the first time in my life,
I could be
a law-abiding citizen.
Oh!
If you so much as blink,
Blaise will remove the skin
from your face, fat man.
She does exactly what I say.
You know why?
We're family.
I put food on her table,
and I put money in her pocket.
My only question for you is:
I put food on your table.
Why don't I get the same type
of discipline
from your big ass?
My bad, D.
I'll stay home.
Good boy.
Let's get through
this Purge bullshit
so we can get back
to business as usual.
D.
There's been an incident.
Isaiah, man.
What you thinking?
Isaiah, you home?
Yeah. I'm just showering, sis.
Did you hear what happened
at Fourth and...
Isaiah, what's going on?
Why's there blood on the floor?
Are you good?
Yeah, I-I cut myself shaving.
You need facial hair
in order to shave, boy.
Open up the door,
or I'll kick it in.
You know I will.
A'ight.
Jesus Christ,
what happened to your neck?
Keep your left up.
Jab, jab, jab.
Get it out, get it out!
There you go.
Hey, hey!
It's all locked and loaded.
We're gonna have
at least 20 soldiers
surrounding this place,
keeping it secure
during the experiment.
Me and Blaise
will be at the stash house
with about two dozen niggas
on the perimeter.
We'll be protected.
Oh!
The eyes, Terence!
The eyes, the eyes.
Your eyes went right to Aesop.
Now, me, you, everybody know
you tossing to Sop.
You ain't talking, but you
telling me everything, man.
Let's pay attention to that.
Everything else
is good money, a'ight?
Let's keep up the pace,
a'ight, boys?
Whoa, what are you doing?
- Thanks, D. Appreciate it.
- Of course.
- Run it from the top.
- Let me through!
Let me through!
Get your hands off of me!
- Don't touch me.
- Yo.
Put your hands on me
one more time,
I'll rip your fucking
balls off. Believe that.
Ooh.
To what do I owe this...
Cut the shit.
I need to talk to you now.
My office.
You son of a...
- Yo, yo, yo.
- I don't believe you.
What is it? What's up?
Isaiah was just cut
by some junkie
off one of your corners.
- What? Is he all right?
- He's going to be fine.
He didn't want to go
to the hospital,
'cause he was too afraid
I was going to find out
he's been hooking school,
working the corner
for the past week.
I had no idea
he was involved, Nya.
- Oh, bullshit.
- You think I know
who works my corners?
Nya, come on. Nya.
I would never let Isaiah get
anywhere close to the business.
You know that.
I watched that boy grow up.
Why'd he... why'd he do it?
Why else?
He's sick of struggling.
He wanted to make life
a little bit easier for us
- with some extra cash.
- And I told you I would
- give you money for that.
- Stop.
I'll never take
your blood money.
You know that.
I-I tried talking to him.
I tried...
I tried being his mother,
his father, his brother,
his sister, but clearly,
- I'm not doing a good enough job.
- Nya, Nya, hey.
- Clearly, I can be...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's a'ight. I got you.
I want you to stay with me
during the Purge, a'ight?
You and Isaiah.
As far as that...
as far as that fiend
who hurt your brother, I'm-a...
I'm-a take care of that,
a'ight?
Take care of it?
Yeah.
What you gonna do?
- You gonna hurt him, kill him?
- Ny, come on.
No, no, no, no. 'Cause that's
your answer to everything.
Right? That's who you are.
Today, it was two people
we know,
but every day,
it's at least two
who are hurt 'cause of you, D.
I know no other way.
Come on.
I grew up here, too.
We all have to make
choices in life
to heal or to hurt,
and you chose the latter.
Don't you care
about this Purge or what it
could do to our community?
I mean...
More selfish bullshit.
Wow.
Now, the Purge is one day.
You, Dmitri,
destroy this community
364 days a year.
You weren't always like this.
The man I knew and loved
years ago
had courage and had soul.
I miss that man.
But thank you for the invite.
I, uh, uh...
We're gonna be fine
without you.
- Oh.
- Uh, um...
Stay the fuck away from us,
Dmitri.
And you're angry.
Yes.
I'm angry.
Very angry.
You want to release that anger?
I need to.
Thank you for
your honest answers.
First, a few formalities.
Baptisias, the official flower
of the experiment.
They represent rebirth.
In the box,
you have recording lenses.
Contacts.
Should you choose
to actively participate,
wear them on the evening,
and they'll document
everything you do.
As I said,
greater participation
yields greater
financial compensation.
Next, we'll implant
a tracking device.
After that, you'll be all set,
as they say...
to purge.
What do you mean,
I can't get off?
No, let me through!
Turn around. You gotta get out.
- No.
- Let me off this island!
A lot of people you know
are gonna be there, okay?
Why can't we just stay home?
Selina, because we can't, okay?
This is the safest place
in the neighborhood.
- I'm scared.
- I'm gonna take care of you.
I won't let anything happen,
okay, mamita?
Okay.
Hey.
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.
Venga, ven.
Let's hurry up.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Luisa, Selina.
Hey. Oh, I didn't expect
to see you.
I thought you would have left
the island by now.
Oh, I was going to,
but, you know, the money, Nya.
$5,000 to stay?
That's life-changing for us.
- We need it.
- Yeah.
Pastor Almory opened up
the church to everyone.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay? We got cots.
There's gonna be security
at the door, food.
And Pastor's going to deliver
a sermon later tonight.
Oh, Lord, forgive me.
Pastor's a wonderful man,
but his sermons
bore me to death.
It's a goddamn
snooze fest, okay?
Yeah.
Why don't you make
yourselves at home?
- Anything you need.
- You'll be all right.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for coming.
Of course. I appreciate it.
Hey, y'all doing good?
We gonna be all right.
Sis.
Are you there yet?
I'm-I'm already
in Brooklyn, sis.
A block away from Uncle...
Uncle T's place.
Um, I-I got the last bus
off the island.
Yeah, I wish you were with me.
I know. I know.
But I just had to get
as many people
off the street
and into the church as I could.
Stay safe.
I'll be fine.
A'ight.
What you say, Skeletor?
There are candlelight vigils
happening all over the country.
Now let's go to Anne with
footage from just moments ago.
That is the last of the buses
leaving the island.
The last ferry
left minutes ago.
We're just minutes away now,
and the questions
on everyone's mind
remain the same.
Will people participate?
Will Staten Islanders prove
that this is a night
America needs?
Thanks, Anne.
And now we're going
to take you live
to the White House,
where President Bracken
will address
the citizens of Staten Island
and the nation
for the start
of the first experiment.
The courageous citizens
of Staten Island...
those pioneers...
will be part of something
that could bring about
great change.
We are all
Staten Islanders tonight.
Good luck.
This is not a test.
This is your
Emergency Broadcast System,
announcing the commencement
of the NFFA Social Experiment
on Staten Island, New York.
Weapons of class four and lower
have been authorized for use
during the experiment.
All crime, including murder,
will be legal
for 12 continuous hours.
Blessed be
our New Founding Fathers
and America, a nation reborn.
May God be with you all.
For our country.
Skeletor's purge is on.
Motherfucker.
Tonight's my night, baby.
You been charging me money
to take out my money?
Fuck that.
I want my fucking money back.
20s, 50s, 100s
or whatever this shit is,
I want that shit right back.
You see me, NFFA?
Is this the first of the night?
Number one.
Making my money.
- Shit going down tonight, boys.
- Yeah.
We gonna purge.
Gonna have some fun.
It's Christmas in March,
niggas.
I got my list. Y'all got yours?
- Yeah!
- Hey, yo, from tonight on,
no more bullshit.
From nobody.
No one, no thing.
From now on, just our shit.
Fuck Dmitri!
This is my kingdom.
It's our night, fellas.
Y'all ready to run down?
- Hell yeah!
- Let's go then, niggas.
And just back
from Staten Island
and joining me here
in the studio is Anne.
Anne, what was the atmosphere
like out there?
Uh, well, you know, it...
People were...
they wanted to see
if this could work.
This violence
fighting violence.
I spoke to both
the anti-Purge protesters
and the Purge supporters...
Dr. Updale?
We have something.
We believe that this is
the first purge of the evening.
Okay.
Get it out there.
Yes, sir.
Yo.
Zo. How we doing?
Quiet, quiet.
Locked down, all good.
Oh, oh, one thing.
Fat-ass Cap A didn't show up
to work today.
Bet you this motherfucker
out there purging.
What else?
If you need company,
we got the girls on the way.
- I'm not interested.
- Yeah, well,
you should keep 'em around
just in case you get bored.
Call me if you need
anything else, bro.
I ask you, do we descend?
On this dreaded night,
do we descend?
Or do we ascend?
That is the question
that we all must ask ourselves.
The 23rd psalm says,
"Although I walk
through the valley
- in the shadow of death..."
- Check this out.
I found Pastor's
secret stash in his office.
- He's got a whole bar up there.
- Are you kidding me?
Thank the Lord.
Monopoly is not gonna get me
through this night.
Oh. He gonna see you.
- Mm-hmm.
- ...no man but God.
It tastes like old-man ass.
Don't ask me how I know.
You sure you don't want a swig?
No, thank you, Dolores.
Okay. Gonna be a long night.
Every dark night,
the sun shall rise
in the morning.
Tonight, young blood.
Get the fuck out of here.
The fuck you looking at?
You see me kill
that motherfucker, boy?
Tough guy.
What you think
you're gonna do with that?
- Stand down, motherfucker.
- Yo!
I'm exercising my right to
purge by taking all your merch.
And if you stand in my way,
I will fuck you up!
Motherfucker.
- Let's fucking purge, y'all!
- Yeah!
I'm coming for my free shit.
- Get back, get back, man!
- Hey, you get back, nigga!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chill, chill.
Fall back. Yo, Isaiah.
Chill. It's me, Kels.
Damn, K. Scared the shit
out of me, son.
Man, what the hell you doing
out here by yourself, yeah?
And why you wearing
those contacts?
What, you purging,
little nigga?
Oh, I see. You out here looking
for Skeletor, ain't you?
Motherfucker made you look
like a little bitch.
Now you trying
to save some face.
Man, screw that shit, yo.
Roll with us.
There's a Purge party
down the block.
What the hell is a Purge party,
my nigga?
Nigga, I don't know.
Could be fun, though.
Let's go find out.
Maybe your boy
Skeletor's there.
Let's go, y'all. We out.
There's nothing happening.
Look at this.
Some kind of block party.
There are actually a couple
across the island.
Parties?
Are you kidding me?
CNB breaking news
from Staten Island.
This footage just came in.
It's being reported
as the first kill
or purge of the evening.
The following is graphic
and contains violent images
- that might not be suitable for minors.
- Selina.
Hey, come with me.
Help me with the other kids.
There's something wrong
with the world,
isn't there, Nya?
There is something wrong,
Selina.
But we have to keep trying
to fix it.
Please, Jesus...
This is very disturbing,
but it is what we expected
to see tonight.
It is very hard
to process that...
what we are looking at here
is actually legal,
that there is no punishment
for this inhumane act.
This is almost
an alternate reality.
Hi. I'm good.
Have you seen it?
No, what is it?
You're a freak!
- What is it?
- Oh, shit, you see this?
Yo, what's up?
Yo, you looking at this, bro?
Holy shit.
Hey, yo, Zay.
Check this out, bro.
It's the first kill
of the night.
20 million views already.
Damn, that's some
animal shit, man.
That's some nasty shit, yo.
But I'm out.
I'm-a go find that psycho.
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
Careful, son.
That motherfucker crazy.
- Yeah.
- Y'all see that?
Yeah, your queens ready
to party with the king.
Fuck, hey!
Whoo!
- Ay!
- Yeah!
Yo.
What up, sexy?
Call me if you need anything.
- All right, cool.
- A'ight?
Good luck, Seven.
Make yourselves at home.
You already know
where the bar is.
Hey, yo,
any y'all seen Skeletor?
- Can't wait, baby.
- Whoo!
Y'all getting it poppin'.
So, what's this?
You're matching and shit?
Yes.
- What up, daddy?
- Oh.
What's up?
Oh, he's ready.
Oh...
Look how sexy she is.
You like what you see?
- You want me?
- So hot.
Mmm.
Mmm, Zaddy.
Founding Fathers...
pay me!
Save me!
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.
Who and how much?
Capital A.
A lot.
More money than we'd see
in ten lifetimes
doing the shit we do.
Wasn't personal, D.
It was our way out.
Purging.
Cherry.
Cherry, they watching.
Make that money.
Soil that soul, Innocent I!
Where you gonna run to, Isaiah?
You can't run from me.
I'm the night, Isaiah.
I'm gonna find you.
It's starting.
The basic tenets of morality
have to be abandoned.
Religious dogma
must be dropped.
People are beginning
to participate.
Don't get too excited.
And to this point, we've seen
mostly looting and vandalism,
with only a few instances
of real violence
across the island.
Take, for example,
the Park Hill Towers,
the center of the community.
Many people are looking at them
as a gauge
of the Purge's success,
but so far,
it's been relatively quiet.
Where you gonna go?
I'm everywhere, Isaiah!
You can't hide from me!
I see you!
- You hear that?
- Get that motherfucker!
I told you, he's over there!
Yo, this way.
Yo, over here.
We gonna get you,
motherfucker!
- I think he left.
- Nah.
Let's check out back.
Where you hiding, boy?
We know you're here.
Mother...
Hey. Just calling to check in.
How's Brooklyn? How's Uncle T?
Nya, I'm not in Brooklyn.
What?
Where are you?
Okay, uh, I'm on my way.
That motherfucker tried us, D.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Get the fuck off of me!
What are you doing?
Let go of me!
What the fuck? Get the...
Get your fucking hands
off of me!
No!
Pussy-grabbing motherfucker!
I told you, he's over there!
Come on!
This way.
Where you at?
Yo, over here!
I think he went upstairs!
Brother and sister.
- What the...?
- Where's your brother, hmm?
Fuck them!
And I don't want to wait.
Can't wait.
No more.
See, I gotta get paid!
No more!
Fuck!
Motherfucker!
Oh, shit.
My girls.
I didn't think y'all
was gonna pull it off.
I am impressed.
I'm the king now.
And y'all are my queen.
So tell me,
that bitch-ass nigga
beg for his life?
Young king!
Your time is up now, A.
It was short.
Hope the crown felt good.
Yo, yo, D.
You thought
that you could use their purge
to take my ass out, but...
Didn't anybody tell you, A?
I don't know how to die.
You can't purge me, man.
I purge you.
In plain sight.
Yo, D.
Later, A.
Fuck you!
Take care of these fools, man.
And let the girls walk.
But make sure that they know
never to step foot
on this island again.
How accurate are these figures?
They were just updated, sir.
You predicted a much higher
level of participation.
We should have
expected the unexpected.
This is an experiment.
There are variables.
- Variables?
- Human nature.
Behavioral patterns vary
according to environment.
Data suggests
that this socioeconomic group
is not reacting the way
that I predicted.
Question is: Why?
I don't give a shit why.
The NFFA put a lot of faith
into this evening.
If it's deemed ineffective,
the entire regime
could be judged as a failure.
I told you that science
does not obey the laws
of politics.
My job is to analyze this data,
nothing more.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, we're looking
at the data right now.
We've gotta get to the church.
We'll be safe there.
So?
What?
You lied to me, Isaiah.
Almost got yourself killed.
Oh, are we gonna talk or what?
What do you want me to say?
That I'm wrong and I'm sorry?
That I learned
my lesson tonight?
Or that I was just being
plain-ass stupid?
Yeah, that's what
I want you to say.
I just said it.
I fucking hate
our apartment, Nya.
The leaks, roaches.
The fact that we never
have anything for anything.
I don't like it, either,
but there are other ways.
Are there?
'Cause I ain't seeing 'em.
I ain't seeing a way out, Nya.
When I was with Dmitri,
I saw a lot of stupid shit.
People getting hooked.
Friends getting locked up.
I've been down this road
before,
and I saw a way out.
Just let me help you
see it, too.
Deal?
Deal.
Hey, yo, hey.
Come on, man.
We-we don't want no problem.
- Shut up!
- Okay.
Don't...
Hey, that's my sister.
- No. No, no, no, no.
- No, no.
Please. Please, no, no, no.
No, no, don't. Please.
What the fuck?
Let's just go.
Yeah!
Shit. Come on.
Yeah!
Where the hell
did they come from?
We are seeing
an interesting trend
emerging tonight.
Some of the people
participating in violence
have been seen wearing masks
and disguises.
The whole world is watching
and wondering...
And psychologists are already
speculating about why
they're doing this,
why they're disguising
their identities.
Is it that the participants
are ashamed of this need,
ashamed that they want to
commit these acts of violence?
- Have you seen the chief?
- Or is the regalia
just a chance for them
to add ceremony and jubilee
to this night of lawlessness?
So I...
I release my anger, right?
I'm-I'm... I purged, right?
- I'm a new man now, right?
- Uh-huh.
Fuck, man.
- That's dumb shit, man.
- Yo, boss, I was thinking.
You want me to try
to find some new girls
to bring up to your office
tonight?
Fuck you, Seven.
Fuck you seven
different ways, man.
Oh, shit.
Look at these crazy fuckers
bucking the system, yo.
Oh, shit, I mean,
that's illegal,
so I guess they purging, too.
Yo, I'll purge like that
every night.
Oh!
Fire at will!
Light those motherfuckers up!
Seven. Seven. Seven.
All right,
one left, one right!
Advance!
Reload!
Zo, we're gonna need some help.
Go.
Watch your leg.
Come on. Yeah, yeah.
- You good?
- Yeah.
The church is right ahead.
Oh, my God.
All right, let's go.
I got like five of 'em, man.
Money's good tonight.
All right, move out.
I can taste that money.
Let's get some more, man.
Come on.
A large group of people
are participating
on Main and Third.
Gang activity across the island
on multiple screens.
Participation levels
increasing.
Increasing violence
on various screens.
Purgers everywhere,
especially in low-income areas.
All data supported
early violent behavior
and then a downturn.
This doesn't make any sense.
Where are these gangs
coming from?
Why weren't they out earlier?
Islanders
are now taking to the streets
as we are witnessing
waves of violence
all across the borough.
The governor is sending
500 state troopers tomorrow...
Don't question it.
This is a good thing
for both of us.
Nya, we can't go...
Nya!
Sorry, sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.
- It's us.
- Jesus Christ.
You scared the shit out of me.
Are you okay?
What the hell happened
in there?
Bastards went inside.
About a dozen of them
started shooting at everyone.
We had to pretend we were dead.
We covered ourselves
in somebody else's blood.
I'm so glad you're okay.
D-Dolores. Dolores.
Where's Dolores?
Have you seen her?
We don't know.
We don't know where she is.
She left earlier.
She went looking for you.
Isaiah, try Dolores's cell.
See if you can find her.
- No, no.
- No.
No!
Some people got out, Nya.
But not everyone.
Nya.
Her phone's off.
We can't be out here anymore.
Let's get to my apartment now.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Be careful.
Check this out.
They all got the same ink.
What is it?
Mercs.
Saw these fuckers overseas
after I enlisted.
They badasses for hire.
They'll work
for anyone anywhere
as long as the cash is correct.
Like Blackwater
back in the days.
Usually ex-military,
and not just American.
These fuckers
are the real deal.
Show me Park and Fourth
ten minutes ago.
Here.
Follow those trucks backwards.
Use drones, street cams,
whatever you need access to,
to see where the hell
they came from.
There's purging
going on all over the city.
It's turning.
- I knew it would.
- Sir.
We have a breach
inside a private office.
I tracked those trucks
all the way
across the island to here:
a remote area
of abandoned factories.
Watch this now.
At around midnight,
something strange happens.
I did a vehicle search
on all systems,
and every one of these vehicles
ended up in Park Hill,
Mariners Harbor and Stapleton.
The low-income areas
of the island.
And they're attacking
crowded places:
churches, apartment buildings,
Purge parties.
The gangs know
where people are gathering
because of
the tracking implants.
How would gangs know
how to monitor
the tracking implants?
They're not gangs.
I want all this footage
on a flash drive.
Did you really think
you could just snoop around
- an NFFA building?
- I know what you're doing.
You're sending soldiers
into the island
disguised as gangs,
as citizens,
hunting people down
using the tracking implants.
You're making it look
like people are participating
because there wasn't
enough purging.
But they're not soldiers.
They're mercenaries
from all over.
This country
is overpopulated, Doctor.
There's too much crime,
- too much unemployment...
- Is that even true, or did you
- falsify those numbers, too?
- And a bankrupt government
that can't afford to care
for its own citizenry.
People don't want us
to raise taxes?
Our debt has tripled.
We can't pay for anything.
We, the NFFA...
we inherited all this mess.
All right,
something needed to be done.
- Not like this.
- Well, what then?
You tell me, because we
exhausted every possibility.
I need for this to work.
I need to sell this
on a country-wide scale
because this is our last hope.
You're trying to depopulate
the lower classes
just so the NFFA
doesn't have to support them.
Come on.
We both know there's...
there's no easy answer
where somebody...
some group doesn't suffer.
What have I done?
You saved us.
I thank you for it.
No. No.
Don't-don't do this.
The American people
don't need this.
- Do not build this on a lie.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- I was wrong.
- The NFFA and America
will remember you fondly
as a hero to your nation.
Fucking Russian?
Something funky going down, D.
Alpha unit
leaving Amsterdam and Oswald.
We know people on that corner.
Let's go.
Roger that. Over.
Now. Come on!
It's getting hot out here, D.
The eyes, Terence.
The eyes.
Come on, D.
We got to get out
these streets.
Got to get home, like, now.
We're not going home.
Holy shit.
We need to keep moving.
Come on, guys.
We're almost there.
Come on, come on.
Easy, easy. Come on.
Hey! Run!
Isaiah!
Come on!
Come on.
Come inside.
You're a lifesaver, Nya.
¿Tú estás bien?
Sí.
- ¿Tú estás bien?
- Sí.
Can we...?
Of course.
Only two hours left
in this experiment,
and the island is a war zone.
Yes, Susan.
The NFFA have been releasing
firsthand footage
from some of the participants.
Nya.
Mira.
Some of the footage
looks like a battle zone.
Isaiah injured his neck
the other day.
It was a lot of blood. I...
I thought I cleaned it all up.
Look, it's nothing
you need to worry about.
Oh, I'm sorry
about my paranoia.
It's just...
This is so crazy.
Okay. Come with me.
This is so crazy.
Come on. It's okay.
I look at her,
and I think about this night.
What they're doing to us.
What they're doing
to this country.
I am worried
about this country.
I'm worried about
our future, you know?
Okay. Listen.
We are not going to let
anything happen to her.
This night will not win.
Okay.
Gear up and load the trucks.
Every soldier we have
is on their way.
Check this out.
I got some brand-new shit
this week.
Gun dealer said we got
a big new batch
from an unknown supplier.
This shit was cheap,
got all new tech.
I snatched it all up, yo.
The hell is this?
This is an explosive device.
It's like C-4
with a handheld detonator.
NFFA been putting all this shit
in the streets, y'all,
hoping that we'd off
each other.
We didn't, and now they're
stoking the fire
in another motherfucking way.
Our neighborhood
is under siege, gentlemen,
from a government who doesn't
give a shit about any of us.
Now, there's a lot
of good people out there
who we're gonna have
to protect now.
See, the NFFA forgot
about one thing.
They forgot about us.
This is our home.
So let's show these
white-haired motherfuckers
never to fuck
with our island again.
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
Thank you, sir. That's more
than we could've imagined.
Yeah, it seems like
the people...
people really needed this.
Okay.
Now make that footage
disappear.
It's me.
- It's Dolores! Open up!
- What the fuck?
Well, I guess nobody
missed me, huh?
Dolores, you're okay.
No, I'm not okay.
I was out there looking
for your little narrow ass.
I was scared to death
out there.
I lost my damn cell phone.
I couldn't call nobody
for help.
Then I get the bubble guts,
tried to run home.
That was a bad idea
'cause I realized
I don't have my asthma pump.
Oh, but it gets better.
'Cause I shit on myself
a little bit
when I was on my way home.
My fucking bowels
done joined the Purge, too.
We're safe.
For now.
We have three
four-man fire teams,
all equipped
with M-4 assault rifles,
frags, RPGs and flashbangs.
Copy that.
Citizens
are mounting a resistance
against Charlie team
on Fourth and Bay.
Echo, transit to assist.
Echo heading that way.
A'ight, well,
here's what we're gonna do.
Motherfuckers!
Fuck you!
I'm hit!
- Oh, shit. Shit.
- Come on, come on.
Shit.
Here. Put that on there.
Move! Move!
I'm out!
Me, too!
I'm out!
Everybody, down!
Move!
Oh, shit!
To the right! To the right!
Link. Right now. Link.
They coming.
Here.
- Here.
- Give me one.
You kill as many of them
motherfuckers as you can.
You make it count.
Let's do this.
Hey. Stay back.
Well, as I live and breathe.
- The devil himself.
- He shall appear.
Let's get these Wise Men
some more weapons.
Beta on Second,
en route to towers with Echo.
Yo, D.
You gotta hear this.
ETA ten minutes.
Proceed to housing project
towers on Main and Bay.
Nya.
Let's go.
What the hell is going on now?
Shit.
Oh, my God.
These motherfuckers
is here already.
What's the move, D?
We know these towers better
than whoever they are.
Seven, I want you to go through
the back with Blaise, a'ight?
Through the courtyard.
Have everyone else come out
the emergency exits
on the south side
and wait for me and Zo.
Outside the main quarter,
all right?
Me and Zo, we're gonna go
through the...
Get down!
Zo!
No. No!
Fuck.
Shit.
Shit.
Fuck!
Seven, I got you.
- Where you hit? Where you hit?
- No, no.
No, you gotta go to the towers.
Nya.
You gotta go.
Go.
Coño, this is not a gang.
It's like a goddamn army.
No, this is
some straight bullshit.
That's a fucking militia.
- We need to try to sneak out of here.
- How?
They're coming in
through all the exits.
Front, back, sides.
So, what do we do?
We hole up and arm ourselves
with anything we can find,
and fight.
We are not giving up.
Okay.
Here's what's
gonna happen, Nya.
They're gonna move
from floor to floor,
killing as many
as they can, okay?
You on the 14th floor,
so you got time.
I want you to move
to the back of the apartment
- and you find a safe place to hide, a'ight?
- A'ight.
Stay strong, Ny.
I'm coming.
Stay down, stay down!
All clear.
All right, help me out.
Come on, come on.
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
Push it against the door.
Come on.
Yeah, block the door.
Okay.
Isaiah, use this, okay?
Three, two, one!
Open it up! Open it up!
Fuck out my neighborhood.
Breach!
The fuck?
Defensive positions!
Lost visual, Captain.
Samuels, what's going on?
What the fuck is going on?
- Someone tell me!
- Can't see shit!
We've got a problem.
Nya, where's the baseball bat?
- Closet.
- Selina, look in the closet.
Yo, what the hell is all this?
We having a fucking barbecue
or something?
Oh, shoot.
I forgot something, y'all.
- Wait. Check this out.
- Selina, look in here.
- Whoa.
- Jesus.
That's a hand cannon.
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.
No way, Dolores.
Have you used that gun before?
I have.
Old boyfriend.
Let me see that.
Geez.
There's only
five bullets in here.
It beats a damn spatula.
She's right.
Come on.
They'll be coming
through this door.
They're going to have on
body armor.
I'm-a shoot low, their legs.
Isaiah, you jump in
and finish them off
- with a knife.
- Got you.
Aim for the neck
above the armor.
Yo, who the fuck
was your old boyfriend?
Everybody else, in the closet.
- No.
- Pérate.
- We're in this together.
- No matter what happens,
you stay in that closet.
For Selina.
Go. Go.
Nah, I'm not getting
in no closet.
I'm staying out here with you.
- Go.
- Yo, this is
my fucking fight, too.
Let's do this.
All right.
Let's do it.
Breach! Breach!
Hug the wall.
Good on left!
Link it up.
Link!
- All clear to left.
- Clear on right.
Get back!
Pull the strap!
- I can't.
- Get his arm, too.
Yo, what the fuck
is really going on?
I'm confused.
Nothing to be confused about.
- Help has arrived.
- D.
You a'ight?
Yeah.
Well, I'll be damned.
Little Miss Nya
and Dmitri Cimber,
the big fucking dog
of Park Hill.
Well, now I know how you know
how to use that gun
- so damn good.
- What up, D?
We got a lot of talking to do
after all this is done, a'ight?
Unit three,
what's your sitrep on the 14?
Three, come in.
Stay here.
He's up here.
Took out half our team.
Kill everyone on this floor.
- Is there anyone else here?
- Yeah, in the closet.
- You'll be joining them, Nya.
- Why? What's up?
No time to explain.
Help me with this body, Isaiah.
- Make time.
- They coming, Nya.
A lot of 'em.
I got one chance to stop it,
but I gotta do it alone.
- What are you talking about, alone?
- No time to explain.
- Get in the closet now.
- But, D, it's almost over.
"Almost" doesn't count
tonight, man. Let's go.
Make room. Do not move.
Do not make a sound.
Do not come out,
no matter what you hear.
- Understand? Understand?!
- Yes.
- I got you.
- Okay, okay.
Why you doing this?
You gotta go.
- A'ight, now.
- No.
I'm with you.
And don't you try
to talk me out of it, either.
It won't work.
Ready!
- Move forward!
- Move it!
Move forward! Move forward!
Get down!
Here.
- Load it up!
- Load it!
Wait!
You're going to get killed
out there.
- Light him up!
- Light him up!
Motherfuckers!
Brother and sister are mine!
Not yours!
Come here.
I want you to just throw it,
and I'm-a shoot it, okay?
Go!
Nya!
Jesus Christ.
It's not all my blood.
I'll be...
I'll be fine.
Hey.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Nya.
- Nya.
- Help him up. Help him.
- You all right?
Slow. Slow, slow, slow.
I got you.
Okay.
It's over?
For now.
Dolores, come on.
We need to make sure
nobody else needs help.
All right, now, make a path.
Come on, y'all. Move back.
- You okay, baby?
- Y'all got this.
- Thanks, D.
- Y'all stay strong.
- Stay strong, y'all.
- Back up.
- Way to go, Dmitri.
- Are y'all deaf?
Saved us, baby.
Big dog of Park Hill
is coming through.
Looking out, D. We owe you one.
- Real soldier.
- Thank you, Nya.
Move back.
I'm not gonna ask twice.
I've had a very,
very long night.
Thanks, D.
Thank you so much.
Oh, my goodness.
So, what do we do now?
Now...
we fight.
Come on.
Stay strong, all right?
Well, the turnout was bigger
than we ever expected.
Staten Island and its citizens
have proven
that this experiment
was necessary.
Uh, we will, of course,
study the results,
but, uh, I've received word
from President Bracken
that we're considering
a nationwide Purge,
uh, as the people
are now calling it,
uh, as early as next year.
One where every U.S. citizen
can participate.
