Hello, Papa!
Hello Nejat. Sit yourself down.
I'm still frying the fish.
- How are you?
- Good.
- And how are you?
- Fine.
I've brought you a book.
What’s it about?
Just read it.
Are you having some raki?
- Sure, and you?
- Of course!
I've got this Iranian friend, Mahmut.
He's given me a tip
for the fourth race.
- Which horse?
- "Ofliff Sunshine"
"Ofliff Sunshine"?
Yes.
The fifth horse in the fourth race?
Do you mean "Sunshine of Life"?
- What does that mean?
- The sun of life.
It would be nice if the sun of life
would shine for us someday.
It's an outsider, Papa.
We'll see, shall we?
Yes! Yes!
the odds were at least 70 to1!
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, there you are.- Thank you!
Come on, I'll treat you
to ice cream, with chocolate.
Who are you screwing at the moment?
A gentleman
doesn't talk about such matters.
I didn't know that!
It's impossible to talk to you
about anything, anyway.
Take care, Papa!
Read the book, okay?
Yeah, yeah..
Goethe was opposed to the revolution.
Not on ethical grounds.
but because it seemed to him
to be too uncontrollable.
Two quotes illustrate this.
"Who wants to see a rose bloom
in the depths of winter?"
"Everything to it's own time.
Leaves, buds, flowers.
"Only a fool could want
this untimely intoxication."
Come on now, old man!
I'm not 14 any more.
I don't come that quickly.
-I'll have to charge you extra.
- I'll give you another 50!.
Talk, talk!
Tell me to grab your arse!
- Grab my arse!
Come on now, my lion!
I want to ask you something:
are you happy with your job?
I can't complain.
Look, I live on my own.
m a pensioner, and a widower, too.
What's the saying?
"Only God is entitled to solitude."
- Bravo.
m looking for a woman to live with me.
I would pay you
as much as you earn here.
In return, you'd sleep only with me.
Agreed?
Have you fallen for me, old man?
You don't have to say anything now.
Here's my cell phone number.
Call me whenever you like.
Peace be with you.
No understand.
Don't lie to me!
We heard you speaking Turkish
Or are you ashamed of being a Turk?
You're both a Moslem and a Turk,
understood?
- I'm not deaf.
- Don't try to be funny
You are on the false path.
Repent!
Repent!
I repent!
Don't let me catch you there again.
It would be a shame about you.
Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.
- And peace be with you.
He's made his move too soon.
I'm glad you came
Will you treat me to a coke?
- Of course.
Are you hungry?
When you said you'd pay me
what I earn in the brothel,
were you being serious?
How much do you earn?
I'm left with 3,000 a month.
Do you have that much?
I'll get it.
- How?
I get a pension
and I have a bit of money in the bank.
I've got
some land and property back home.
And I have a son.
He's a professor at a German university.
He earns good money.
If the worst comes to the worst, he'll help me.

When his condition improves,
we II keep him in for observation.
Do you have any questions?

-27.
II
Does she know what you do?
She thinks I work in a shoe shop.
I often send her shoes.
I'd do anything for her.
I didn’t t want her to be uneducated
I wanted her to study
and become like you.
Getting old is evil.
There's absolutely
nothing good about it
It's completely pointless.
- You'll soon be okay.
- Right...
Don't forget to water the tomatoes.
Nejat,
the tomatoes are ripe for plucking.
Do you want one
- Just to try.
Let's take him some!

I can't get hold of her for some reason.
Did you screw her?
I’ve made some borek.
Would you like some?
Take that away.
I don't want any borek.
Don't look at me like that.
The doctor said   "No pastry"
- Then eat shit!
You won t eat borek, but you smoke.
Are you taking the piss?
Don't get involved in my life.
You have yours and I have mine.
You re leaving?
Wait!
Here, for the journey.
Yeter!
Get me a raki, girl.
We will soon be arriving in Hamburg.
Your connections...
Did you screw him?
I asked you a question.
You're drunk.
No, I'm not.
Don't touch me!
Stop that!
I've paid you,
and I'll fuck you whenever I like!
You don t own me
- Yes, I do.
I own you!
Go on, give me a French job.
You can shove your money up your arse.
Where are you going?
Where?
I'll go wherever I want.
You're not going anywhere!
You're not going!
-I'll say it again: I'll go wherever
I want. I’ve seen plenty like you.
Yeter?
Yeter!
Then here to the right
And stop
So, then you go in here, please.
It's small.
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
So, in you go.
You II be given
your personal items later.

Listen, Nejat.
The streets, these case files,
are full of Kurdish children.
We deal with them every day.
They are illiterate

Wouldn't you rather
help one of them?
What good will this do?
- Maybe someone will get in touch.

Please have a seat.
Why do you want to sell such a lovely shop?
- You know...
I've been here for about ten years.
And all of a sudden...
find myself missing Germany,
and the language as well,
Even though I'm surrounded by it here,
with all this literature.
But it's...
like a museum here.
Extinct. Like Latin.
And I've been feeling...
homesick.
I understand.
How much would it cost?
What was your name again?
Nejat Aksu.
What's your occupation?
m a professor of German in Germany.
- That would be funny, if...
A Turkish professor of German
from Germany
ends up in a German bookshop in Turkey.
That fits!
Yes, maybe...
So you're staying in Turkey
for the time being.
Yes.
What about your work?
Maybe teaching isn t my calling.
What about your father?
A murderer is not my father.
