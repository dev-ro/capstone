[Speaks German] Mrs. Merkel,
do not force us, do
not try to radicalize us.
Remember, astronauts
who have nothing to lose
there is no more dangerous.
[newsletter credits]
[presenter speaks
German] Strike of astronauts
Dear viewers on the sixth day.
They have just
published themselves
there will be those you know from the music clip.
We are with the leader of the astronauts, Cemal.
Cemal, what exactly is the
problem, can you explain?
Good evening.  We have been blocked for ten years.
Our families and friends
are making fun of us.
Daddy, where is this? Is it from
space? When are you going dad?
The money that will send us to
space has not left the budget this year.
They even taught us to eat in
space, to sleep, to forgive shit.
We gave our years to this job.
If you wouldn't send it,
why did you steal our life?
Our actions will continue
until you send us to space.
We have nothing to lose.
We have nothing to lose.
[announcer quietly]
Where did this come from?
Can you tell me how
I should continue?
[answer from headphone]
Well.
- Is your outfit state-owned?
-No, we did it ourselves.
[boy yells] My teacher,
Ali stole my pen!
My teacher, Ali stole my pen!
My teacher, Ali stole my pen!
My teacher, Ali stole my pen!
My teacher, Ali
stole my pen! [ringing]
[grunts, smacking his mouth]
[pretending to be a cat] Ahmet
Arif Bey has forgotten my food again.
Not "Ahmet Arif" dear.
-Ahmet Misbah.
- It says "Ahmet Arif" in front of me.
Kenanigim, Ahmet Misbah. The man is
my customer, will you know better than me?
Ahmet Mispah.
Misbah? B or p? Misbah.
Let's add some
more jokes to that cat?
[sighs] Or we jokes these
We actually wrote to the tree. The cat
would have been more cranky like this.
How?
"The cat would be the more surly."
I say. That was the joke of the cat.
How is this joke? The
animal to be said to yourself?
So funny I think.
Not my Kenangi. Not at all. Come on,
add some things. Let's go to our house.
OK.
[Kenan grunts with cat imitation]
I wonder if I leave here
around the trees
can i pee
[grunts, chuckles]
[They speak German] You
got out and set yourself on fire.
-It's a huge move. -Thanks.
Do you know? You
are a living legend now.
-Exaggeration.
- They'll send you to space this year for sure.
You should never give up. Your fight is
my fight. Your revolution is my revolution.
[phone rings]
- So until the end... - Sorry.
I will be with you until the end.
-Hello?
-I am an astronaut.
Hello, who are you?
Yes brother.
[Speaks Turkish] I
hear it, please. Mazhar?
Father?
[bird and insect sounds]
[woman] Cook it.
[instrumental music begins] He
followed the butterflies until he died.
They made fun of it.
He never spoke.
When he died, he would bring it to his corner one by one.
He would save them.
Everyone would make fun of it.
He never spoke.
He opened thousands of tombs on his skin.
One by one, the butterfly buried
the dead in the holes in its skin.
Everyone made fun of it.
He never spoke.
It just stopped.
It stopped.
One day it stopped.
It stopped for two days.
Morning of the third day
thousands of butterfly wings appeared on the skin.
And he flew away.
No, we cannot finish
this. Something big.
How many grams of something did you bring?
This is like a lamb. Where
did such a thing come from?
[sighs] Emre, I want to leave.
Suzan, how's that?
-I want to leave. -When?
What do you mean "When?" Now.
-I'm sorry my love. Suddenly nonsense...
My love, where did it come
from, my love of leaving?
Where did he come from?
I've been telling you this for three months.
You've been saying for three
months. You're telling me this.
I think you will not get the fish.
My love, if you tell me
why don't I know about this?
You know what you
said when I last said it?
-Emre! -Sir?
-Sir?
-I came to the lounge, you were at the computer.
"Emre, I want to leave." I said. You
slowly lifted your head from the computer.
You looked at my face and said "sushi in this country
You are so stupidly
expensive, isn't it? "
-I said that?
-If you want, I'll come soon.
Sweetheart.
I have been telling you that I want
to leave four times for six months,
You haven't even heard of any
of them, Emre. I want to leave.
My love, it's been like this for six months, right?
No, Emre, it's been like this since
the beginning of our relationship.
For the past six months
I just wanted to leave
- I'm trying to tell you.
-Sweetheart.
I Kump.  Sweetheart.
Sorry.  I neglected you a bit.
O Bolu Tunnel tender.
I've been ruined since
I bought it. It ruined me.
My mind is not on my
head. I neglect you too.
I'm not calling, I'm not interested.
I am aware of this, I am aware.
We...
We took Durmazlar Holding as a subcontractor.
They were going to do the ventilation
while we were driving the stakes.
Although he is not in the contract
now, Durmazlar Holding has
the SSI premium of
all, all West side workers
He says I have to pay.
You idiot, if I'm going to pay the
SGK premium for all of them...
[phone rings]
... why did I take you as a
subcontractor? I'd make them payroll.
These guys would have
payroll. I show both as expense.
I fall out of the tax. -Hello.
- [Emre continues to
speak] -Cemal brother?
Brother, I'm fine.  How are you?
Did something happen?
[Emre continues to speak]
Did my father call?
[rock music player]
[yells] Can I have a beer?
- [shouting] Do I know you? -Ha?
Do I know you?
-No. I do not know.
I do not think so.  But it happens to me a lot.
-A lot? -Exactly.
Either I'm used to it.
Either I'm an actor.
I played in a drama called The
Bottom of The Neighborhood.
Where?
I played in a drama called The
Bottom of The Neighborhood. Iso.
[cheering sounds]
-The lead? - [Kenan laughs]
I will be the main role and the side role that
I will be the headline, and I would be better.
[Laughs]
[Emre continues to speak]
No brother, I'll come to Istanbul.
Let's go from there all together, okay?
I am now picking up my
ticket tomorrow morning.
Okay, okay, see you.
[Emre]... I do not understand
without ventilation, if we will not do.
My job is piling son,
piling. I pull the stake, I go.
I will not interfere with the rest.
How should I know that ventilation...
I also know that Emre
is cheating on me.
-With whom? What? Who...
-Emre, I'm leaving you.
After that, there is no old Suzan.
Shaking your head is so pointless.
Either there are money in these series but
it locks people from such
acting. So it steals from there.
That's why I'm making voiceovers.
Hmm.
There are family videos like that,
people don't like your own voice
sometimes we dub it.
- So is the cat and the dog...
- What?
We write words to cat and
dog or something. It's funny.
- Is it funny? -Exactly.
-Your phone is ringing. -I know.
-You won't open? -No.
[girl laughs] Is
she your girlfriend?
It writes "Cemal".  My brother.
He must have wondered you.
Ugh. So he searched four times in
30 years. I don't think you're wondering.
Okay, so something
important is looking for.
I'm afraid of him too.
Should we go to a more comfortable place?
I was so tired of talking like this.
[laughter]
-Hasselba Link. -Hasselba Link?
-Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.
-Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Exactly.
He was a very good striker.
Brother is Dutch. -Yeah?
288 matches, 129 goals.
He had a great harmony with Zola.
Gianfranco Zola.
[song ends]
[cheering and applause sounds]
The phone that I fucked her mother.
[door opens]
[Kenan sighs and sighs]
[phone rings]
[groans]
[shouts] Enough! Enough!
[door player]
[vibrates the phone]
Hallo! Surprise.
[vibration sounds]
[vibration sound is cut off]
Aren't you going to say anything?
What... what should I know? I couldn't be like
that when I saw it. What are you doing here?
I said come to see my brother.
By the way, isn't it Kenan, I'm not wrong?
[Cemal] What's up?
[Cemal] Are you available?
I entered at such a time.
I'm free, come on. Sorry, something
happened at a time when I saw you.
Son, how many times have
I called? Look at your phone.
-I entered with shoes, no
problem? Come in. I'm going in.
[Cemal laughs] Wow, artist life.
Was there a party?
Yoo.
Are you hungry? -Look... What?
- I'm going to eat something, are you hungry?
-No thanks. I ate on the plane.
You just said something.
The HI.
Our father called.
He calls us to Hasanlar.
[Kenan sighs]
He said, take Suzan and
Kenan, come to Hasanlar.
It was important.
Come on.  Very good.
Very good.
We'll go tomorrow.
-Are you talking to my father?
- I'm not talking.
Okay, we'll hit the road tomorrow morning.
Where are we leaving
tomorrow? Are you kidding?
Will we go to Hasanlar after 30 years?
- Kenan, he called.
He said it was important.
I spoke to Suzan, and he is
coming. It's here tomorrow morning.
- Is Suzan coming? I've
been looking for two days.
Either you are taking your
phone busy or not looking.
- Is Suzan coming here?
-Yeah. It's here tomorrow morning.
I'll make you a bed aside.
You will go tomorrow morning
with Suzan and Hasanlar.
Kenan, my father said, "Take
your brothers, come." said.
Have you ever heard of
such a thing from her mouth?
I haven't heard anything for 30
years, from his mouth, let me hear it.
-You look, you're hiding something?
-Like what?
Let me know, 30 years from now.
[sighs] Take it.
- It's a bit dirty, but now.
-No problem.
He called quite calmly.  It was important.
[sighs] Tomorrow
is a beautiful...
... we have breakfast, Suzan comes too.
Then you go to Hasanlar.
I can't come, I have a job.
-What are you doing? -Request...
I have a set or something...
The -Set? -Yeah.
New series?  Which?
As if you know the old one.
New series... I have no set.
Here is a voice over...
- [makes nonsense sounds] -Hi?
What should we talk about, you tell me...
-What? -Let's talk later.
OK.  I am now, my overlap...
- [gagging vomit] -Oh. Kenan?
Come on, let's go to the bathroom, come on.
- I vomited black.
OK no problem.  Come on, let's go to the bathroom.
I vomited black. Come
on, Kenan. Come.
I'll call you a few minutes
later, will you? Five minutes later.
- [Kenan laughs] - Come on,
let's go to the bathroom. Come on.
[electronic music sounds]
[music sounds louder]
[Cemal] Morning sunshine.
I sent the doorman to the
market. Jacob. Funny guy huh.
[Kenan sighs]
I thought our conversation last night was a dream.
[ringing] It was a nightmare.
[Kenan] Ah.
Are you hungry?
-Girl, you stepped on my foot, maniac. Ah!
-Pardon.
I hired a car. So
that we can go easily.
I do not remember, though.
After all, I was eight years old.
I'm not coming.
Our father called Kenan.
Or "Our father called." Do we have a
father for 30 years? What is our father?
Kenan, my father called. He called
you and Suzan and told me to come.
Absolutely.  "It's important," he said.
EA?
There is nothing to do.
[door opens]
[woman shouts] Crap!
-Kanan, who is this
woman? Hello, I'm Suzan.
Kenan, who is this Suzan?
[sighs] Brother.
-Who are you? Hello,
I'm Cemal. My brother.
[woman] Her brother.
[woman shouts] Kenan!
-Ugh. The-Edge!
Who are they?
My brothers came.
the sister? -Yeah.
How many years have we been with you, Kenan?
-Four.
-Half past four. Half past four.
-Right.
It's getting cold. Exactly.
-Half.
It's half way.  Yeah.  Exactly.
You haven't talked about your
brothers for four and a half years.
You said to me, "I have no brother."  You said it.
- "I have no family." You said it. Do you remember?
-Yeah.
-I remember.
-Good if you remember, okay.
Is your brother out of
nowhere? Excuse me, brothers.
-Two one. Not one.
-Your night my brother...
-No, I called you last night.
-Exactly.
-You didn't open your phone.
-Yeah, because my brother came last night.
Aras you were.  You disappeared in an instant.
-No, my brother came last night.
- I would come to you.
I'm telling you something, do you hear?
-I was dealing with my brother last night. Really.
-Look... -So huh, sure.
- Because you didn't open your phone...
- [Kenan shouts] Either shut up, okay!
I'm already dealing with these, enough!
-Why are you shouting at me?
- Okay, please.
-No, it's not over yet. Kenan is not over.
-Let's handle this, then let's talk.
- [Kenan] Okay, stop! Done!
- [woman] It's not over! Are you crazy?
[woman shouts] I really don't
understand what she is anymore!
Enough!
I will fuck your brothers
too! [knocks the door]
-Oh! A little bit nervous.
Some things have been overlapping these days.
Kenan, we go to Hasanlar.
Good luck, go.
You come too.
-No, I'm not coming.
- [Cemal] You are coming.
-No, I'm not coming.
-You're coming.
-I'm not going. -You're coming.
-I'm not going. -You're coming.
-I'm not going. -You're coming.
-I'm not going. -You're coming.
Will you shut up?  What are you doing?
-You're coming. -I'm not going.
-You're coming. -I'm not going.
-You're coming. -I'm not going.
-You're coming. -I'm not going.
What is he doing again? Is
he trying to hypnotize me?
-It's coming. You're coming.
-I'm not going.
You're coming.
What have you got?
- [Cemal] You are coming.
-With such sunglasses...
-You're coming.
-I have some problems.
- [Cemal] You are coming.
- [Kenan] You have some problems.
- [Suzan] Uh-huh.
-You're coming. Well,
inside with sunglasses...
-You're coming.
- Shut up! I'm not going! I'm not going!
I'm not coming.  I'm not coming!
I'm not going.
Okay. If you do not come, we
stay here without leaving anywhere.
Kenan look, my dad won't call
us in vain. Don't regret it later.
No, come on the bottom for a
few days, then we'll come back.
[Cemal] You never wonder?
Come, let's go together.
What is there to be so long?
What if there is a situation, if it is sick?
If it is sick, let me put it on the
patient's cunt. Is it sick to me?
Did he call us once, for 30
years? Did he wonder once?
-Hallo. I say he called.
-For me to forget them
I tried so hard. They passed, I
forgot them. These are left behind.
-Kanan, I say he called.
I'm not saying he called.
Did he wonder once?
The man was treated for a
long time. As if you don't know.
- Can you get angry in this situation...
- I'm not angry.
I'm not mad.  I just...
...I do not care.  Ugh.  It is what it is.
- [sighs] Come, let's go together.
- [Cemal] Don't be a teenager.
Am I acting adolescent? Look at the man
who said to me, "You're being a teenager."
"You're coming,
you're coming." he...
Brother for me.
I need a time. I have to get
away a little bit. I'm not good.
I need you. Come,
let's go together.
He didn't call you, okay, thank you. How many
times have you called me? Your little brother?
Here I am, I called.
"I need."  I say.
I'm calling.
Suzi.
Let's put some good
music and enjoy it.
The road is long.
["Another Summer Ends"
plays while the band is sunrise]
[Cemal is accompanied by a whistle]
Another summer is coming to an end.
The sky was cloudy
Waves are tired, heavy
-Ah!
- Like they breathe off the shore
- # Tents have been
dismantled # -What was that?
- Was it the Yeni Turku, what was this?
-Yeni Turku?
-Grup Gundogarken. I love these Guys.
- # hostels are empty #
Brother, i guess you have been in a coma
rather than in Germany for years?
Heavily hearts
- # Separations like a game
# - This road won't pass.
[horn sound]
#Another summer #
-My mother committed suicide.
- # Hopes despair secretly #
Let's repeat. Tell. "My mom committed
suicide. My mom committed suicide."
Come on. Look, it took me a
lot of time to be able to say that
But after I said it, I felt
relieved and liberated.
Come on, Come on Kenan. "My mom committed suicide."
-Are you crazy?
Is this something to be
kidnapped? [phone rings]
No, it's not something to be kidnapped.
The subordinate committed suicide.
- [Kenan] Are you a silence?
-Kanan, look, my mom committed suicide
-and this is not your fault.
-I know him.
-The anger in this is not your fault.
-Can you shut up? Can you shut up?
It's not the fault of any
of us. We understand.
- Sir, Emrek.
-Astronaut's Road Guide.
- [Emre] Where did you go? Where did you go?
-Cemal brother, can we cut the music down a bit?
-Sir. -Where are you my Love?
-What is that?
-The name of the book I wrote.
Demand Realization: The
Astronaut's Road Guide.
Are you writing a book? I -Yold.
- [Cemal] Yes, personal
development book. I'm going to Hassan.
For example, I am talking about this
method of persuading you in the book.
I'm not going to anyone.
- Did you convince me? -Yeah.
I used the repeat method
this morning or on you.
- [Emre] Why are you going?
- My father called.
Are you a Buddhist in Germany?
Something you want it to happen
- you repeat it all the time.
- My father called, to my father's village...
-You repeat and it's happening.
- [Emre] When are you coming?
- [Suzan] I don't know.
You convinced me to come.
Now that he's sitting there...
- With my brothers right now...
- [Emre] What are you trying to do?
[moans and breathes deeply]
[Emre]... that is
the work of the piles
easier than subcontractors...
- He's still talking. I
... to subcontractors...
-Who is it? - [Suzan] Emre.
Kocan Emre?
- My future ex-husband.
-What is he saying?
- Says "Subcontractor."
-... we do all the work...
What do you mean?
-It means the person you transferred the contract to.
Are you playing
subcontracting or something?
Wait a minute, stop.
What does "handing over the
contract" mean? I do not understand.
- He tells me about his job.
-OK. How beautiful. He shares with you.
-... nobody agrees with this idea...
-Continuously. Continuous.
-Continuous. It constantly shares.
-Then Taþron comes to work...
Subcontractor.  He is still sharing.
I'm embarrassed, I'll call you later.
I'm not available now, Emre.
-... you are adjusting, you are...
-Al...
I'm with my brothers right now.
I'm not available. I'll call, okay?
What I'm angry is the subcontractor...
[sighs] What annoying is this!
Like a game
But you know the smartest part?
Ay, what's the smart side?
-The brother was writing a personal development book.
Each sentence is 140
characters. So why 140 characters?
"So why 140 characters?"
"So why 140 characters?"
- On the Internet... On the Internet...
- "So why 140 characters?"
"So why 140 characters?"
-To be published on the Internet.
-"Internet."
-Yes, so they can post on Twitter.
-"Twitter."
Young people are constantly
on Twitter, on social media.
So I wrote 140 characters
for each sentence.
- # Hopes despair secretly #
- This road will not really pass.
Other personal development
writers, such as Elke Heidenreich.
They never pay attention to
such things, no. It is important.
If you do not catch the age,
you cannot fall into the future.
Isn't that right, hodja? Falling into
the future is a very important issue.
- Or who are you?
- "What about those who are?"
Who -Dend. - "Denden on."
Fingernails are. - "Teeth."
Can we cut the music down?
That someone else is talking
required to indicate.
Or whoever put it, they think it is his sentence.
Aa comma.  Zitat that.
Well, that's probably it. When you write
someone's words, you put it to the end.
-I'm telling me. -Hýmm. Yeah.
-I couldn't think of it.
- Can we turn this music off a little?
-My head is really turned.
-Not so, Kenan Bey.
It will play what I want first, then
you. Then your youngest brother. Suzi.
So let's take a right or something.
I'm going to piss blood
on the back seat now.
-Kanan, we just started.
-We just started. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's stop, have
a cigarette over there.
Hopes, despair secretly.
A little more insatiable A
little more love desperately
#Another summer #
[Cemal] I'll ask the
friend over there.
- [Suzan] Ah.
- [Kenan] The glasses are gone.
Excuse me?
[grasshopper sounds]
Pardon.
Good evening. Is it possible to
go to Hasanlar from this side?
[Kenan and Suzan laugh]
[Kenan] From what side?
- [laughter] - [Suzan]
Stop, don't shut it down.
Al Cemal brother.
-If you asked German?
-Oh, sorry.
[Cemal] They would
answer in Germany.
Excuse me, sir, look?
- Sorry, sorry. Excuse me.
- [Cemal] Ha ha ha.
[match sounds]
- [Cemal] Good evening. Good luck with.
- Good evening, thank you. The room, right?
-Yeah.
-Of course, the room. Come on, late.
[reception] Are we together?
Yeah.
-My brothers.
-How good. How beautiful.
Ah!
[Cemal] I will ask something.
Can we find an open
place to eat at this hour?
-Ha?
- It's a place open at this hour,
to eat.  Can we find it?
Oh sure. Outside the town,
there is the Calm Music Hall.
Calm Music Hall. -Yeah. Do not.
Do not.  I get my IDs out.
-Okay. -Mother mother
I found a place to eat.
-Very good.
-We'll stay in a room.
It is not a problem right?
Off.
We throw something in one or two.
I got him.
["Ruin My Heart" plays]
- Come on, welcome. Here you are. Sülo.
- If your purpose is killing
- # Kill and get rid of # -
Welcome to our magazine.
Let me tell you, brothers, please.
Is the kitchen open?
-It's about to close but I have meatballs and appetizers.
- [Kenan] I buy meatballs.
-You make that patty three.
-They make them three.
I -Chef. Does raki fit?
-It is. -It's a big racket.
-Racki is great. -Exactly.
- Also cheese, feta cheese.
-Cheese.
-Fruit. -OK.
- [Kenan] Yeah. What
a strange place, isn't it?
-Give me some ice, ice.
-Silo, and bring me ice.
It's like something, you know,
it's happening in your dramas.
You turned my heart into
ruin [women laughs and shouts]
[Cemal] Wow, I never thought.
In such an environment with my brothers and sisters.
-They look strange to me here.
-Nothing happens.
-Why do you know that nothing will happen?
- Brother's here.
Son, you brought
us to a casino to eat.
When I say "casino"?
-Yes, they eat us here.
Nothing happens, dear.
Oh. -Is it enough?
Put more. - My strange heart
-Hello. - If my heart wants you
- [Kenan] Look ahead, ahead.
-Ha?
Look at the front.
- # Tell me what should
I do? # - [Cemal] Sorry.
You got excited when you saw the wife, didn't you?
It doesn't come from my hands
- Can't take your eyes off there.
- # let me disassemble you
[clink glass] Cheers.
If my heart wants you
Tell me what should I do?
It doesn't come from my
hand that I will disassemble you
Good thing you came.
I've come here so far. I
don't know what's next.
Nonsense.  No turning anymore.
We are not astronauts son, we are actors.
Our right and left will not be known.
Kenan has no turning back.  We are going.
You turned my heart into ruin
[phone rings]
You brought my life to the edge of the cliff
You turned it into ruin
You are my heart
[applause and whistling sounds]
Come on come on.  Our health.
So, are you singing cats,
trees and dogs like that now?
-Exactly. So how do you live?
-I live because I am short.
-You live because you're short.
Cemal, what are you
doing, except astronaut?
How's life there?
- Did you say "I'm writing a book"?
-Hide. I am writing a personal development book.
So, when do you go into space?
-We're talking about that more.
-Who are you speaking to?
- Are you talking to the people of space?
- [man] You call.
-No, with the authorities.
- [man] You ate.
-That those. Hmm.
- [man] Yedin Kamil, you ate. You ate my son.
-Do you go directly, do you transfer?
- [Cemal] Hamburg has to transfer.
Is it possible to go with Istanbulkart?
You don't know Ýstanbulkart now.
Do you relax when you talk like that?
How do you go to space?
Is it always the same place?
-The road going to the same place?
- [man] Excellent...
If you are comfortable, you can really continue.
-Vall to.
- [man] He doesn't want to understand.
- [man] What is Faruk brother doing?
- It was like shit, dumplings?
- [Cemal] They overpowered the garlic.
- [man] Found trust.
[man] In this sink,
get up and go...
[Kenan] They will print
us here, you have no idea.
-For example, in Kamil. It tells me a story.
- [Cemal] No problem, I'm earning euros.
- Don't say that...
- [Kenan] Euro?
It's all about Kamil. I do not
say anything to Faruk evening.
I don't understand Kamil. Kamil.
-Euro go.
- It's all about Kamil.
Faruk brother is poor.  Did he get it?
There is no perfect master.
- [Suzan hits the table]
-Kemal brother doesn't do that.
- Who's Kemal, son? Kamil la, Kamil.
-Hush!
You, dombili.
- Guy says get up...
- I say to you, mustache!
-Perky. -Do not you understand?
Why Kamil did so
-Do not you understand? -What?
Exit.  I do not understand.
Let me put some understanding
in this corner. My head is swollen.
I saw my brothers for the
first time in years. Vir vir vir
Kamil did as follows, enough!
- You fucked my
head! The -Suzan.
What are you looking at,
child of my mouth? Go away!
The -Suzan.
- Lady, are you telling me?
Miss is mother, I say to you.
Who shall I say? I say to you!
Sister, are you talking to me?
-I fuck your brother. What is your sister?
Did your mother fuck my father? What older sister?
- [Cemal] No more.
-I'm gonna take your dick off!
- [Cemal] Suzi. What are you doing?
[Screams of Suzan]
[music gets louder]
[horn sound]
[Suzan moans]
Lan! Lan, are you still here?
-No no.
Don't look at me!
-Allah to my book... -Suzi!
-... I'll break your dick, huh!
-Suzi, don't be silly.
Don't look at me!
- Suzi, enough, what happens.
- My friend, okay.
-Ornamental! Ornamental!
Take it, go. -Suzan is!
Let's go, come on, okay.
-Where are you
taking me? Come on.
-OK. -I'm distributing here!
-Suzi, what happens? Suzi, please.
- I'm silent, I'm silent, are you a man?
Lan! Enough.
-OK. Let's go to the hotel.
What are you holding?  I'll distribute it here!
[Kenan] My daughter,
they're gone! They went!
[moaning]
[Suzan shouts]
Wait, this is not the case.
-Kenan, late.
-Okey stop. Your mother... Allah Allah.
Our ass hurts our heads too.
[laughs] What
are you looking at?
- [Cemal] Hiþt.
- [Kenan laughs] Is it a flush?
I will drink raki again.  We came.
- [Suzan laughs] Number one.
- [Cemal] Suzi, stop.
Open the door.  Plug.  AA.
I'll do something. Wait
outside. I will wear my pajamas.
Feeling.
Balloon.
-Ah. - Did he say "Balloon"?
What does that mean?  Balloon?
What should I know?
How is he swearing?
-It swears very well.
-I never heard it in my life, they swear.
What does "I sit in your mouth" mean?
Your nose is bleeding.
Of course I'm bleeding.
We had a car beating.
I don't have a watch.
What are you laughing?
Scheisse.
You hit it nice, though.
You hit well.  Is not it?
Is it an astronaut shape, what is it anymore?
You hit it beautiful like this.
You're getting out of the thing.
[Kenan laughs]
They packed us. They packed it.
My back is also very bad.
We had meatballs like
shit, we got nice beating but.
After all, something like that happened.
Laugh a little.
God bless you.  Ah.
This place is so bad. I didn't
understand when I got beaten.
[rumble comes from inside]
Suzi.
-Open Open. The -Suzan.
Maniac.
Get up, get up.
Remove it.
[Kenan laughs] Allah Allah.
Get up girl, wake up. They
took the watch of Cemal brother.
[Kenan laughs]
Lan, what are you laughing Kenan?
[Kenan's laughter]
Cemal brother, Cemal brother, get up.
-Good Morning.
-Cemal brother, no Kenan.
- How is it not? -No.
How not?
What were you talking about last night?
What were we talking last night?
-What were you talking about?
-What were we talking about?
-Ah, Cemal.
Yesterday you were discussing
something in the music hall.
- Yeah.
-What were you discussing?
Here it is...
His right and left are not certain,
He was saying that he could
go back home at any moment.
But he was drunk, so his head was not in place.
Did he say that?
-Suzi is not gone.
At least he didn't take the car.
Where's your phone?
Hah, here it comes.
-Where were you?
- [Kenan shouts] What?
-Where have you been?
-Breakfast is finished. I went to buy a donut.
I filled up with gasoline.
-What are you looking at?
-Let me collect the items.
What are you grinning at?
Are you going to sleep?
Come on, get dressed.
The pastry is hot, come.  Come on, get dressed quickly.
[Erkut Taçkýn plays "Father"]
Ugh.  My back hurts.
The actual hour is gone.  Hour.
He's gone, brother, get well soon.
Sorry month.
What happened to us last night? What
did they do to you? Did they say something?
Did something happen?  What?  I do not understand.
They didn't say anything.  They did not say anything.
-You were cursing the men?
-Yeah.
Now I want to say the
moment I feel that I feel.
The last day a father called his children.
Desperate everywhere
he called, that day
If a father didn't give love,
Even if he hid the love
How could the children wait for him?
After a father teaches kissing
Sorry, forgive her
Even if there was no father,
Loneliness, loneliness
He taught this the truth too late
All of you meet now
# Shaking hands with kisses.
All of you meet now
[popping sound]
[cow and chicken sounds]
What was that sound?
I do not know that. Do they
blow up dynamite or something?
Did we come? You were going
to wake up just before you came?
Girl, what should I know?
I'm not coming every day.
[Kenan] Suddenly,
the sign appeared.
Kenan, let's park somewhere here.
- There's a shadow place over there, over there...
- Okay, I get it.
Gee. We will park.
We won't always go.
That left side.  Stop it.
- [cow voice] - [Cemal]
Hah, wait like that.
-You don't remember the house, do you?
-Exit.
Let me ask the friend over there.
Let everyone put it on his friend's pussy.
-Ugh. Let me go, let me see a little bit?
-Well okay.
[cow and bird sounds]
Hello, let it be easy. -Thanks.
I'm Cemal.  Mazhar's son.
-Mazhar's son?
-Yeah, I'm my eldest son.
Now we came with my
brothers. I said let me say hi
I said, let me ask
about my father's house.
I just asked a friend outside. He also
told me to be head of the headman.
-You are the Mukhtar,
right? I -Muhtar.
Who said that?
You said it.
I?  What did I say?
-You said "I'm the Mukhtar" now.
-No, I'm not saying that, son.
Who told you to come here.
Ha who said I don't know him.
So he was a brunette friend.
Is it brunette?
-Brunette. Did our Hüseyin say?
The -Hus. I do not
know that. Is he tall?
No. -But brunette.
Brunette.
Gee.
-What did he say?
- "Stop by the Mukhtar." said.
-What did you say?
-I did not say anything.
What did he say?
Here I said, "I am looking for Mazhar's
house, he will be my father." I said,
he said, "Stop by Mukhtar."
said. I did not say anything, I came.
It's either Hüseyin or Zahit.
Didn't you say brunette?  It's either Hüseyin or Zahit.
Could be.
-You're Mazhar's son, are you?
-Yeah.
He called the other day. "Come
on, jump, come to the village." said.
We will surprise him.
Surely it will be a surprise.
Did you say he called?
He called. "Take your brothers,
come to the village." said.
Thank you, brother.
Thank you.
-What does it mean? - Thank you.
-Did not you know? -What?
Oh, let me sit here, brother.
What was your name? Kemal?
-Cemal.
Look Kemal.
The events are in the events.
You know, those babies are
there... Petruska... Patrikka?
They are intertwined. Was it
petushka? What was their name.
Matryoshka.
Now you take one of them
for example, you open it up,
Take another one, for example. But his
face is similar to him, so it is the same.
You open another one of them.
He is even smaller than that.
So they are all intertwined, but
their faces are in each other...
You got it.
[cow sound]
[bird sounds]
That's exactly what it is like.  So
- It looks like petruska dolls...
- Matryoshka.
-What? -Matruþk to. Babies...
Did something happen to my father?
Matryoshka.  Matri, matir.
It sounds strange too, look, I
never thought of it. A change...
[cock crows]
[music sounds from the radio]
Uncle, who is this?
[rooster crows,
chicken sounds] Hey!
[low voice] Don't come. Coming.
- [shouts] I don't hear.
- [whispering] Don't come.
Away. Away. Get away from
the chickens. [chicken sounds]
What happened to the chickens?
Get up.  This is coming to the chickens.
[Kenan] What happened
to the chickens?
Get away from the chickens, get away.
There are some things I
don't understand right now.
-Relax relax. Do not. Do not.
-Daddy, I'm not interested in your chickens.
-I am Mazhar's son. We're looking for Mazhar.
- Get away from the chickens. Away.
I don't understand.
[burst sound]
[shouts] What happened? What
happened? What just happened?
[explosion sounds] What
happened? Did the chicken explode?
[explosion sounds]
- Chicken broke? -Ornamental!
Hush hush.  Shut up.  Are you Mad?
Why don't you understand words?
[chicken and dog sounds]
-What happened? What happened?
-Lan okay, shut up.
- Shut up, okay.
- Is it mine or is it my blood?
-No. Bleed, are you okay?
Good sister, good.  It has nothing.  Good.
-Kanan, what happened?
-What happened? What is this?
-Nothing, chicken exploded.
- Chicken broke?
Chicken has exploded!
-What did it explode?
The chicken exploded.
- [shouts] Chicken exploded!
-We've been like this for a
week. The chicken exploded.
Either they take pebbles to their snipe,
to grind the millet.
Do you know him?
A powder truck was overturned
in the village square last week.
These are millet or gunpowder.
They ate all of them. -All.
-Idiots.
-What. Now of course stomach gunpowder...
Uncle, what are you talking
about? The chicken just exploded.
-What... -I burst into my face!
-We are telling him.
Which wind blows you?
We are the children of Mazhar.
We're looking for the home.
- My bleeding son, you're fine, nothing?
I'm fine, I suppose. How should I
know? Is there anything? Such an...
Wherever I wash my hand and face
years later, if I don't face
the man like this? Be afraid of.
Yes, on which side is his house?
Brother Mazhar... You don't know?
I thought you came for him.
Look, you will have
a mistake. I know you.
You came out while this was all you went.
- Your mother did something.
Brother, what are you saying?
- Stop by a Mukhtar. Brother,
I'm already coming from Mukhtar.
He said something stupid,
then escaped, disappeared.
Then stop by imam,
he knows more.
Who is Imam? Where?
- Imam in the mosque.
-Cami is over there. Do not
be wrong, you come to imam.
I'm sorry.
You're fine, aren't you?
-How should I know?
- [door knocks] -
[Cemal] Hodja, hello.
I Aleykümselam.
Here you are.
Suzi, you wait.
Come on girl, come on.  Come.
-Here's.
- Teacher, we are Mazhar's children.
Did Mazhar have children?
- We are, hodja, here we are.
-How, what happened?
-Hi, you guys.
Look, what about you, your
father? Your superior head is blood.
Chicken burst, sir.
These days they are exploding.
Here you go, you survived.
-Here's.
-How, sir, what should we order?
We came today, nobody has been
telling us anything since morning.
I went to Muhtar, and
he ran away somewhere.
Then I asked the guys when the
chickens did something. They also
he spoke a strangely strange.  Sent it to you.
-You are right. -Teacher.
-Sir? What happened
to our father?
He's dead.
So he migrated to wood.
-Tahtalýköy?
-What. Unfortunately.
-When did it happen? -Yesterday.
- Did he say "Tahtalýköy"?
- "Tahtalýköy" was said.
-Tahtalýköy. -Tahtalýköy.
And where are you hodja?
I'm looking for you everywhere.
- Are you looking for me?
-You left me in the room.
-I did not go.
You go. -I did not go.
You go.
-I went to the side room.
To get water.  To gather my strength.
No dear, I saw through
the door. You ran away.
Here I say, I went to the
next room. To get water.
You did not go. -I went.
You did not go. -I went.
You did not go.
-I went, but that doesn't matter.
I have news for you.
Brother, your father is dead.
We know, we are talking about it.
-You know. -Who is this guy?
-I do not know. Is -Muht.
Yes, I am Muhtar.  You know it too.
Why don't you cry?
-Are we going to give an account?
-Yahu Muhtar,
stop, be calm. We are
sitting, we are talking.
You came to your father's
funeral like this. So fate.
We came to see our father.
You have come to
bury, not seeing. Kismet.
Here is Allahutaala.  He called us.
My condolences.
So everyone really
liked Mazhar Efendi.
-The whole village loved the
people. Everyone loved my father?
You are that in Germany, right?
-Yeah. -Do you live in Germany?
So my aunt raised me
after that in Germany.
I've been there since I was little.
-What do you do? I -Astronaut.
-Astronaut. -Yeah.
How, with a helmet?
O miserable.
Have you ever been to space?
Hopefully soon.
-God willing. God willing.
I'm also interested. Such Supernova,
black matter, energy or something.
- You know Neil Armstrong...
- Sir?
Sir, my daughter.
-What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
-We get out of here, for a meal or something...
-We go for a meal.
-We eat.
-E is a peasant place. What are you going to do?
- We have dinner.
-Ha. The village is already.
What will we do with our father, not him?
Haa.  So our funeral is ready to be buried.
If appropriate, like noon
tomorrow or afternoon
With Allah's leave, with the congregation
we can bury our funeral.
Would you like to wash your father?
[Kenan sighs]
-It is. -OK.
Then we meet and handle it in the morning.
Come on then. -See you.
Muhtar Efendi, will we
stay at our father's house?
-So if you want we can set another place.
- [imam] So.
Let's stay in our father's house.
You're all in blood like that.
Yeah.
No, so you're going out
of the dead like this bloody,
who sees will say, "Did
he kill this?" [Laughs]
You turned the killer
back to the scene.
That's it.
It is spoiling everything.
Cemal brother, let me eat the oil of your eyes,
Don't talk to your imam about your matters.
Imam Efendi is strange these days.
He says "I have concerns."  says.
Is it a black hole in something?
Here is seismic or cosmic? Are
we a coincidence or a connection?
He got them there. He preaches a friday,
tells a black substance on a friday. Valle.
We wrote to Diyanet, now
we are waiting for an answer.
Look what happens, don't confuse her.
He won't stop after ha.
So.  "We can't speak."  also.
"As Astronauts Union, we
have no such authority." also.
Are you hungry? I'll
send something, food?
No thanks.  Thanks.
Now, but with this head, there is
no food. You came from the road.
I'm sending you something.
Haha.
-Thanks. -My condolences.
-Thanks. -My condolences.
[instrumental music begins]
What did we expect after all?
[sighs]
[sighs]
He called us to bury himself.
-Do not miss, no such
thing. What the hell is that?
He didn't call us for years.
He called, we came, he died.
Kenan, are you angry
now that he died for man?
There must be a mistake.
Should there be a mistake?
That's the mistake.
The family we were born in.
This.  This is wrong.
Our mother committed suicide as a child.
-No more noose next to you...
-Heshsh Kenan.
The guy pulled us out the door.
He didn't call or ask for 30 years.
This is it. This is wrong.
These. These are mistakes.
[sighs]
This guy was crazy?
Everyone loves it in the village.
He was running to everyone's
help. I didn't understand that.
He left us a letter.
-Who left it?
-Dad? -We have a name on top.
What is Suzi
writing? Read it aloud.
This is his will.
"When the butterflies come, bury me.
After burying, a black road
starts at the end of the village.
Follow that path.
When the road is divided into two,
nature is correct... Follow the mountain.
There is a stony path to the
summit, when you follow it
you will see a great plane tree.
There is a blind shepherd under that plane tree.
Tell him that you are
Mazhar's children. "
Is that all?
[Kenan] What does this mean now?
When the butterflies come, he wants to be buried.
[Kenan] What does "buried
when butterflies come" mean?
- He was waiting for us.
- What does "When the butterflies come" mean?
- [Suzan] He was waiting for us.
-Et's waiting for us, of course.
He called us.
He was waiting for the butterflies. We will
also see the blind shepherd. It's crazy.
[woman cheerfully] Welcome.
Welcome.
-Hi. -Hi.
My condolences. I said, let me bring
something to eat. You are tired of the road.
- [Suzan] If you didn't bother.
-No dear. Hot.
- [Cemal] Thank you. Here you go.
- [woman] Thank you.
- I'm Hatice. I am the Muhtar's wife.
- Is that so? We met him today.
Oh oh how beautiful.  How beautiful.
Eat it when it's hot.
Well, you came just in time, Mrs.
Hatice. I will ask you something.
What does "when the butterflies come" mean?
It means when the butterflies come.
Sorry, I asked at a moment.
We just found our
father's will inside.
He wrote in the will. "Bury me when butterflies
come," he says. What does this mean?
-You are asking him. -Yeah.
So every year, this time tons of
butterflies come to this village. Die.
People always gather around.
We close the peasant glass frame.
Then we clean it with a shovel, so many.
Look at Mazhar.  Gee.
- [Kenan] When do these
butterflies come? Valla is in his ear.
First they make it hot, then they come.
Well, let me.
You have something to talk about.
Come on Bismillah. Here you go.
-I will pass you.
-No girl, no thanks. No.
Our mom's tale.
What tale?
Do you remember Kenan?
He would follow the butterflies
and wait for them to die.
-Do not you remember?
-What's the story?
You were small, you can't remember
Suzi. Kenan, don't you remember?
I don't want to remember anything
anymore today. OK. Yetti. Yetti.
What is this? "Do you
remember? Do you remember?"
Where are you going?
[Cemal] You haven't slept yet?
Look at Suzi, if you are not comfortable
above, let's make you a bed here.
What fairy tale are you talking to Kenan today?
My mother used to tell a fairy tale
to put us to sleep when we were little.
[Cemal] Like poetry.
Of course, I can not remember at such a moment.
It was the story of a
man waiting for butterflies.
Follow the butterflies,
The story of a man waiting for them to die.
Gathering dead butterflies
and buried them under his skin.
After waiting for two days
thousands of butterfly wings
came out from under the skin.
Then he flew away.
Didn't you sleep until this hour?
I could not sleep.
-Cemal slept? -What?
-Cemal slept? -Yeah.
[Suzan sighs]
[popping sound]
[dogs bark]
-Are you hungry?
-Exit. I am not.
How are you?
It's like I've never lived here.
As if I never lived here.
If I see him, I know him.
[sighs]
If I had seen my father then he would have died.
I was going to be my father.
We didn't have our father.
I will not be upset
after this time. You too.
We didn't know him.  That's it.
Not like that. For example,
you remember that tale.
What did you say to me before
you came? Do you remember?
What did I say?
-I always think of it.
-What did I say?
"I tried very hard to forget
my family." You said it.
The HI?
-So?
- That word touched me a lot.
-I thought so much.
-I didn't mean you, dear.
No, it's not that I'm stuck.
You try too hard to forget...
I want to remember something
I've never experienced.
This is very difficult.
I mean remembering a memory you've never experienced.
What kind of mother was that?  How would he strok my head?
I invent memories.
It feels like I remember after
a point. It feels like it happens.
For example, that light comes
from behind your hair. Ea...
Always asleep me. I
have a moment in my head.
A light comes from behind her hair.
Touch of one hand...
[sighs]
But then I realize that...
... I don't know what color my mom's hair was.
I don't know if anything happened at that moment.
For example, did he ever tell me that tale?
[sighs] Like this...
... I have memories in my
head, I remember them.
Actually.
Probably none of them are real.
Then what was my father's voice like?
How's her hand?
As if they never lived.  No...
Like I've never lived.
-Anyway I am going to sleep.
- Give me a cigarette.
[sighs] Where are
you going to sleep?
[sniffs] I'm going to
sleep in my dad's bed.
We made Cemal evening bed,
you will be curled up to the sofa.
Give me one towel.
OK.
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.
Oh.
[instrumental music]
[Kenan sighs]
My mother used to tell that tale to you most.
It made you sleep first.
We would listen to you while we were sleeping.
You would sleep right away.
Her hair was brown.
Teacher?
- Sir Muhtar Efendi. Let's
get out of here. What happens.
Ya Muhtar Efendi, I
tell you my situation.
So why are you
saying this right now?
Why are you tempting me?
-When I have this in my head...
-How, when?
Look, Muhtar Efendi,
Verse 286 of Surat al-Baqara:
"La yukellifullahu nefsen illa vus'aha."
"Allah does not charge anyone more
than his power is enough." he says.
Give me some time.
- [Cemal] Muhtar Efendi, Sir.
-Hi. -Hi.
-Hi. -Hi.
I wanted to talk to you
about my father's funeral.
Yes, we were waiting for you.
- Well, we said we'd break it in the afternoon.
- Teacher, okay, we found your will yesterday.
"When the butterflies
come, bury me." he wrote.
Did he want to be buried
when the butterflies came?
He writes so in the will.
-What are we gonna do, hodja?
-What are we gonna do?
Now, Mr. Cemal,
-Cemal was, right? Astronaut.
-Ripeness.
-Cemal, teacher. -Cemal.
Well, we were keeping your
father ready for you to come.
So let's get this work done first.
Then let's take care of
your business. Let's do it.
Is it clear that day?
-No, it's not certain.
If the heat has gone, they always
come. So they come tomorrow today.
Anyway, you can talk later, teacher,
people gathered,
come, let's handle this.
Okay Mukhtar, you go.  I am coming.
-Teacher! Take a walk. I repent.
Cemal Bey, let's talk about
your issues for a while.
Issues to speak. He said,
"We'll talk." Don't look at him.
His head is gone.
-Good Morning.
- [Suzan laughs] Good morning.
What are you laughing girl?
-I have never seen such a sleeper.
-How am I sleeping?
How am I sleeping?
You looked so funny.
What are you laughing?
Did you prepare this?
-Memal brother prepared it.
-Already...
-Where is Cemal? -Output.
He went to talk about the funeral with Muhtar.
Funeral work?
You can not snooze.
Will we really wait?
This is his will.
Where did you go? You laughed,
you laughed Put a cup of tea.
-Welcome.
-We found it nice, hello.
-Welcome brother. -Hi.
Everyone is also gathered.
Hodja is on his way. You wanted
to talk about this chicken issue.
What is it?
-Why don't we call a vet?
We urge. We call it too. We will
wait. We notified the district governor.
What did he say?
What do you mean "What did he say?" Hatice? As
if you weren't my wife, as if you didn't know.
-What do you mean, "What did
he say?" OK, what did he say?
Weren't you there when you were talking, Hatice?
Why are you doing this?
-Any other question?
-What did he say, what did he say?
"We will wait," said Hüseyin.  We will wait.
How long have these chickens been
exploding? Ever since the truck tipped over.
Hatice, shut up, look what
happens. I will have an accident.
-I'm very angry with you. What happens?
- [man] Truck...
Since the truck was overturned.
Haha! Since the truck was overturned.
These chickens ate these gunpowder.
There is gunpowder in the animals' body.
[instrumental music]
- [Suzan] Kenan? -What?
Come on.
Look.
[Suzan] He cut
them all, hid them.
Hoot.
[Kenan] He cut programs.
Are you okay?
I'm going to get air.
-Where?
-I will look at a Cemal evening dress.
[sighs] Let me fuck my type.
What should I do,
guys? Am I a vet?
I told the District Governor, this was the case.
If there is a better idea, let it be
said. Let's do. What shall we do?
Now let's go to this chicken
issue. Let's talk about the rain.
My ready teacher came too.  Teacher!
Let's talk.
[clears his throat]
Well okay, let's talk.
Sir, you know how long...
So our village is dealing with drought.
Our crops have dried up.
- [man] He, sir.
We cannot dig the land. It turns
out that we are going to open a grave.
[Mukhtar] Valla villager
gathered for this, hodja.
We called you for this.
We want a rain prayer.
[Hatice] What will she say?
It's going to be silly again.
-Hush. -What?
Huh, teacher?  Let's do this rain prayer.
Let's get out, let's pray.
When should we go, hodja?
-So I... - What are you saying?
Hodja, isn't there a rain prayer in our religion?
- There is. -So?
Okay then. Let's get out, let's do our prayer.
The villagers should also be comfortable.
Let's get out tomorrow. Ha? Let's
get out tomorrow. Let's go tomorrow.
Then this is...
-... the matter of rain prayer...
-Hah.
This rain prayer we...
I can't do it, Muhtar.
-How can I "do it", teacher?
-I can't.
So you know my situation.
You say rain prayer, for
God's sake. Prayer of rain.
So you are saying that God
should rain this village, right?
Yes, we say that.
- My friend, what rain?
-Yes, we say.
Let's say he hears us, let's
say he hears everything.
And it answers everything.
You created the entire universe.
How many galaxies in the universe,
how many planets are there like us.
Put it all aside,
Come, it is rain to Hasanlar.
What about that? Ha?
Do you mess with this?
Why should God take
care of your rain? Why?
What are you talking about, hodja?
It's a matter of balance, bro.
Rain falling on Hasanlar rain
that does not rain on Çoraklar.
Don't the barren want rain?
Teacher, what are you saying?
It's a matter of natural balance.
Are you in trouble? What kind of teacher
are you? Did the sun go into your head?
My friend, is Allah your
servant? I repent, astaghfurullah.
You go, disturb the balance
of nature. Destroy everything.
After that, may Allah rain
there, May Allah rain here.
God is luxury, luxury. It's
luxury. It doesn't run to everything.
Sir, a little calm.
But friends, you are a
little calm. What happens.
Hodja, your nerves are well stretched.
Look, a weather change,
a rain is good for you.
He is not interested. I'm
telling you. She's not interested.
God is not concerned with
your rain. I'm not going to pray.
-Who says he's not interested?
- I'm saying that!
I'm im. Do you know better than me?
-Teacher?
[bangs and screams]
Either this village has gone mad.  Everyone is crazy.
Again chickens burst.
I fucked your mother. Whatever I touched
since the morning has been in my hands.
What did you do, did you
shower? If you took off your clothes.
Don't step here with bare feet.
I always messed around here.
Where's Suzi?
-He went looking for you.
- Do we drink raq, young people?
- "Do we drink raki, young people?"
-Where are you come from?
- From my father's body.
-Are you okay? Come on, come on.
You wash those tomatoes, Kenan. I
will grill the eggplant, we make a salad.
You get rid of those cucumbers.  Tzatziki.
Were you there all
day? I did not see you.
I saw you. You
came with me, imam.
-If you voiced it. - [sighs]
I took a chair next to my
father today, I was thinking.
There's something about
calling us here, it's weird.
We left with a death, we left.
We went back with a death again.
And now we are together.
Who broke this?
I will handle it.
[Cemal laughs]
[Kenan] What are you laughing?
I'm nervous.  Our mother is here...
I repent. Our father is in the gashouse.
We are in an environment like this.
[Cemal laughs]
I read a news of suicide the other day.
In the newspaper.
[laughter]
Pardon. One man committed
suicide in Düsseldorf.
[laughs] Before suicide...
[they all laugh with laughter]
He left a note.  Note.
-You know what it says on the note?
- [Suzan] What does it say?
But look at this fact.
- "Manchmal bin ich so..."
-What?
"Manchmal bin ich so traurig."
-So...
- [Kenan] What do you mean?
"Sometimes I feel
so sorry." [Laughing]
So sometimes I get very upset.
I mean, I don't always feel sorry.
That's why I commit
suicide. [Laughing]
I read this one. So the people
around me are looking at me.
What is this laughing for?  After I read them.
They looked at me
coldly. Is that crazy?
[Cemal] "Sometimes
I feel very upset."
Good thing you are.  Cheers.
[laughter]
[Spray the Cemal raki]
Pardon. Pardon. [Laughter]
[Suzan laughing] Moon.
-Yeah. -Moon.
You didn't play my
song in the car. Çakallars.
"Jackals"? Your mouth starts to
deteriorate, look again. Be careful.
Oh, don't come over me.
What are you going to do?  Will you say?
[laughs] Stop.
Where is it going?
[Kenan] What will he do?
[Suzan shouts] Let me shit in
your mouth. Who left this here?
[Cemal] Look,
I'm afraid of that.
He connects him to the
truck driver. Mr. Driver.
[Suzan] Shut up!
[Nazan Öncel plays "Let's Go Here"]
What was this?  Oh 90s.
We connect it to Cemali from here.
"I Want To Hear" comes.
It happens after that.
There was a man named Cemali, right?
- Not a man, boy, they were brothers.
[Suzan accompanies the
song] #Lal la la la lala la la la #
[Kenan] was Nazan Öncel, right?
#Lal la la la lal la la la #
#Lal la la la lal la la la #
Tell me to wait for the spring
- [Cemal] Bravo Suzi!
- Don't let the branches of the willow bend today #
Don't let my brother come to pass me
No one should be upset by one of his mother.
- [Cemal] Vuu!
- Don't let my brother come to pass me #
No one should be upset by one of his mother.
- # Let's go from here # -
[Suzan shouts] Come on!
[they start to accompany
together] # I can't stand #
Let's go, I can't
forget from here.
Let's go, I can't stand here
# Oh let's not
forget from here #
[laughter]
[they shout all together]
# Let's go from here #
#I can not stand#
# Oh let's not
forget from here #
Let's go, I can't stand here
# Oh let's not
forget from here #
Sitting next to my father today...
I was saying to you
yesterday, "I don't remember".
What?
There is a veil between us.
Did you remove it?
I was lifting.
I could not remove.
I was afraid that I would see a stranger.
I could not remove.
Ugh. I couldn't lift it, what should
I know after this time? That's it.
When he first called me, I
did not know his voice first.
I hung up the phone.
Then I waited such a
week, without doing anything.
Shall I come or not?
So I give you some right, Kenan.
[sighs] What did you
do, what did you do?
You said at home, "I will not
come, I will not come." He said.
-I can understand you.
- "I waited a week." did you say
-Yes, I just stayed.
-You waited a week.
[Suzan] Did you wait
a week to call us?
We didn't set off as soon as we called.
No Suzi, I couldn't get out.
So if we get out of now... Repentance repentance.
-We were going to see our father alive.
Did the man die while waiting for us?
What could I do? 20 years
later, the phone came suddenly.
I couldn't call you immediately.
What kind of person are you? Ha?
The man is calling, "Come now." says.
Cemal, who died two days ago.
Did the man die while waiting for us,
Are you calling him, huh?
Kenan, what do you
say if you love Allah?
I convinced you to come
here, or you would never come.
I beg you, we brought you
with Suzi. Is it a lie Suzi?
What happened now when I fastened
that I will not come or come as a child?
You suddenly became a big man and
you ask me why I didn't come before?
"You have no right to do this." I
say. "I would decide that." I say.
I say, you wouldn't be
here if it was up to you.
It was as if it was too.
What kind of a week
do you expect to call us?
How would you make such a
decision alone? I do not understand.
No I do not understand. Why
didn't you say that before?
I say "I couldn't say" Suzi.
[Kenan] You couldn't say.
You could not tell. Is that so?
You could not tell. He could not tell.
[Kenan] He couldn't say.
You could not tell.
-You know how to say
shit 40 times. The-Edge.
What are we doing here?
What are we doing for two hours?
We play family.  Ha?
We are unable to do this job.
Did you understand? we suck.
We bury it tomorrow, we disperse.
Everyone goes their own way.
Tomorrow everyone is going their own way.
He could not tell.
Always the same, always the same. Always
the same thing, always the same thing.
Always the same thing, Cemal.  Enough.  Yetti.
Always the same thing.  Always.
Tomorrow we are buried, we are falling
apart from here. Did you understand?
I couldn't say at once.
[chicken sounds]
Make the tomb of the deceased a
garden from the garden of heaven.
[man whispering]
Hush, what is this?
Is the beekeeper dressed?
-How should I know? Astronaut.
-Do not extort punishment, O my Lord.
Give patience and jemil to
those who are left behind.
Everybody talks about you.
- [everyone] Amen.
When we take this path one
day, please give us the Quran.
I have never seen such a ridiculous thing in my life.
Dear community, on the way to the hereafter
all your rights and law in the
hereafter to the late Mazhar Efendi.
- Would you mind?
- [Everybody] Halal.
- Would you mind? -Good job.
- Would you mind? -Good job.
-Are you pleased with him?
- [everyone] We are Raz.
-Are you ready? -Razýyýz.
-Are you ready? -Razýyýz.
May your Almighty Mawla be reasonably
welcome your martyrdom and halal.
[imam] Lem yelid and lem yed.
And lem whole lehû kufüven ehad.
Kul e'ûzü binnâs.
Melikinnâs.
Ýlahinnas.
Min shit...
Ýlahinnas.
- [Hatice whispers] Aha stopped.
- [whispers] Don't start, not now.
-Friends...
- [Hatice] Valla begins.
Friends, I know.
Neither place nor time.
But so...
Not now, not tomorrow, when?
Sir, shall we continue?
-What shall we continue, Mukhtar, pray?
- [Mukhtar] Hodja.
So Mukhtar will go to
heaven, not to hell, is that it?
- Sir, read this prayer. Lets.
-What happened?
will this happen, shall we continue this?
Sir, read this prayer,
read, let's go, let's go. Lets.
Exit.  I will not read.
I repent. [people are said]
-Read will not.
-Huh, teacher, are you crazy?
We have a funeral, look, their children
have come, from there, from here. Let's.
Are you Mad? Are you sick? Do you
want beating? What kind of thing are you?
Yahu Muhtar Bey, my brother.
What if there is none
of this? Heaven, hell.
What if it's a gap?
What if it's dark? - Whoa!
If it's dark, it's dark!  What the hell are you!
Come on read it!  Let's finish!  Let's!
Am I hodja? Should I read?
Come on read it, let's go read it.
-Let's!
- What's bad with the dark?
See. What does Surat
al-Baqara say in 260th Verse?
"Once upon a time Ibrahim
'O my Lord,
Show me how you
resurrect the dead. ' said.
Allah said, "Didn't you believe?"  He said.
He said, 'Yes, I believed
but for my heart to be
mutmain and soothe
-I want this.'
"Repent, repentance."
-So? the -Yah
I repent. What about resurrecting the dead?
We have funeral, we will bury, we will go.
There is no resurrection to
the dead. You got me wrong.
[Cemal] What are you
talking about reviving?
No, no resurrection of the dead.
I'm not talking about
resurrection. I want to talk
Even Ýbrahim
Aleyhisselam can doubt it.
-So? So the headman,
I can't read the prayer I'm not sure.
I'm trying to tell you,
you don't understand.
Hüseyin, you know. I have
dreams, that is, I have dreams.
Not a read.
-Who is yours, your prayer, your dream!
-Teacher! Teacher! LAN!
-Lan don't run away!
I'm a shit in my mouth.
Every time, either.
Man, I hope they
catch this one too...
How many, is this game?
What happened now?
There is nothing. You would see the one
that came out last Friday. This is nothing.
- This Zahit is not a little crazy, huh.
- Psychopath or psychopath. It doesn't stop either.
Hodja also speaks nonsense.
Friend, let's bury, let it go.
-Kalk, get up. I
repent. Help me.
-What are you doing
there? I'm collecting.
Come soon, help me.
I was upset by the nerve.
Where are you going
now? Brother, these are now
they bring the imam captures.  They call us.
-They convince you,
you relax. They shelf.
If they can not convince,
will it remain open?
-No, they will.
- They bring it, they bring it. Do not worry about it.
We bury the man
against his will.
For now, stay like
this, I will find the imam.
It cannot stay like this, it will feed the bird in the wolf.
Okay, Suzi, I'll handle it.
-What will you handle?
How can you not tell us? Idiot.
You came out and came
here with an astronaut suit.
What kind of person are you?
Ya Kenan, if you love Allah,
shut up. Look, it's not on the nerve
so i will not argue with you.
Here I will find and bring the men.
[sighs]
You'll leave your father
here as you left me, right?
Kenan.
Do you know what did your brother
Cemal do? Did he ever tell you?
[Cemal] Kenan, look. Extension.
We are at our father's funeral.  Extension.
The subject has nothing to do with you.
The subject has nothing to do with you.
Let go of that cowardice
and face it now.
Am I afraid?
When our mother died, I found her first.
Another noose hung beside him.
While trying to put the rope around my
neck, my brother Cemal entered the room.
You know what he did?
He turned away and ran away.
So.
So. Even if you run away or
don't want to hear it, it's Cemal.
That's why you're not calling
me, I know him too. I know that too.
But this is so Cemal.  This is it.
You left your little brother there.
You left.
You were my big brother.
I would look at you with envy.
You left me there.
You came now and you
say "you are cowards".
Am I afraid? What?
Am I afraid? Am I afraid?
[shouts] Am I afraid?
Ha? Am I afraid?
You ran away, you.  You ran away!
It wasn't enough, you became an astronaut. You're
trying to go to space, let's put it in your pussy!
If I had suffered that noose that
day, I would have died, you know?
You idiot, didn't you
know my mother?
Who chose to take it with you?  Ha?
Which of us was enough for that noose?
I did not run away from you, Kenan.
-I never escaped from you.
- [shouts] Enough!
[shouting] Enough! Enough!
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
There was something in my head.
There was something until I saw you.
You destroyed him.  You have ruined!
We don't even have a
photo that we're side by side.
You put it in my head!
What about you
In that car, when I saw that shit in the
pavilion, I became someone else after a long time!
I didn't notice until I saw you!
I always have a pain here!
It has been sore since
birth, so I didn't notice!
But my shit always hurts!
What are you talking about?
Look at you!  Look at you!
Your father is in the grave! Your father is
in the grave! Our father is in the grave!
Just bury it! Goms
you! Bury! Bury!
Bury!  Bury!
[instrumental music
begins] Embed! Bury!
[hiccups]
Are we completing the will?
[music is cut off]
Hello there.
We are the children of Mazhar.
Mazhar's children.
Sit down.  Sit down.
Sit down.
I was waiting for you.
It was three years ago.
It was raining time.
The rain was falling
so hard, so strong
as if the sky was pierced
It was like it would crash over us.
I was soaking wet.  I wet.
I had nowhere to go.
I knocked on your father's door.
He took me in.
He gave a bowl of hot soup.
He split his bread with me.
The rain was so heavy that
the roof of the house was flowing.
I went up to the roof.
I repaired your roof.
To me...
... you owe 500 lira.
[Kenan sighs]
[Kenan] Oh!
[Barýþ Manço plays "Daughter of Binboða"]
Why are you laughing?  Why are you laughing?
Go on. - Get up.
She was blind, shepherd. Should
I put a fairy tale on this cunt?
I left my father's stove years ago
One day, fate pulled you over
You looked like you disappeared like mirage.
It is nice to call the creek hill
I'll call you
It is nice to call the creek hill
I'll call you
I asked the bird in the
dry, they said give up.
She is the daughter of Binboða, what do you need?
You looked like you disappeared like mirage.
I will call you beautiful if I say stream hill.
I will call you beautiful if I say stream hill.
I came from the Kozan Plateau is Barýþ is my name #
If we are today, we will not be tomorrow.
One day, of course, it will call the valley, my God.
Now I will call you on the day of the apocalypse.
Now I will call you on the day of the apocalypse.
Believe me I will call you on judgment day
Now I find you on the Day of Judgment.
