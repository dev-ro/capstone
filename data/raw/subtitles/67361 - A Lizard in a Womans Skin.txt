She's turned the place upside down.
She's gone crazy trying to find her fur...
The Gordon woman from
the third floor phoned.
She said Julia Durer was strangled,
found half-naked with a fur next to her.
You didn't bring the paper,
Frank? You always do...
Sorry, Carol. l brought it.
l must have put it someplace.
What are you trying to hide from me?
- Carol, stop thinking about it!
l'd like to...but it's not
easy... with everything going on...
Mrs. Hammond is dining, Mrs. Gordon.
Then don't bother her. Tell her
she can call me back. l'll be home.
l must talk to her. l have to tell
her something very, very important.
Yes. Mrs. Gordon?
- Hello, dear. Did l bother you?
Have you read the paper?
- No, l haven't read any of them yet. Why?
l gave you the wrong information...in
the confusion l guess l misunderstood...
That good-for-nothing, yes,
Durer, was not strangled.
No, my dear, not at all.
They stabbed herthree times,
each one of the stabs fatal. lt
says so quite clearly in the paper.
At what time would you like the car, ma'am?
- Quiet, idiot! Oh dear, sorry!
Two of them in the middle of her chest
and one slightly beneath the first two.
And with a letter opener! Can you
imagine what a horror that was...
What are you doing?
Did something happen?
The letter opener! Oh,
Frank, it's not possible.
Not possible that even my letter opener
has disappeared. l have to find it...
She was killed with just that, a letter
opener. Just like l killed her in the dream!
Mrs. Gordon said she was
stabbed three times in the chest.
l stabbed her with the letter
opener three times in the chest too!
That's absurd, Carol. Absurd!
Oh, Frank. Help me
Frank! Help me, please!
Here, have a drink, it'll pick you up.
- Thanks.
