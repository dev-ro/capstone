[mysterious, whimsical music]
[young girl] Wow!
[young boy chuckling] Not again.
No, I really see something this time.
You have to believe me.
[chuckling] There's nothing there.
It's just fire.
Look again.
- There's nothing there.
- Hmm.
Maybe you're right.
[woman] All right, my loves.
- Good evening, Grandma.
- Good evening, Grandma.
Ready for story time?
Can we please read
The Night Before Christmas?
[warm music slowly rises]
I think it's time for a new story.
Okay, don't just stand there. Come on.
[blows]
The Invention of Jeronicus Jangle.
{\an8}[whirring]
{\an8}[young girl] Look at that!
{\an8}[metallic grinding]
{\an8}[book unlocks]
Never read us that story before.
I've never read anyone this story.
"Once upon a time,
many, many years ago…
lived the greatest inventor
in all the land…
Jeronicus Jangle."
[gears grinding]
[woman] Children, come inside!
From humble beginnings,
his mind never stopped spinning.
More gadgets, more gizmos!
The whole town was abuzz.
[toys chiming]
Oh! Where are you running to?
[grandmother] Excited to see
the most magnificent shop
that ever there was…
[girl] Pardon me. [giggling]
[grandmother] …Jangles and Things.
- [excited chatter]
- [toys chiming and whistling]
[magical music soaring]
- Everything was alive.
- [quacking]
Even things that shouldn't be.
Jeronicus was inspiring to all,
none more than his
most trusted apprentice,
Gustafson.
Prepare yourself
for Gustafson's magnificent…
[chuckling] …marvelous, eh…
Bout of brilliance.
The Twirly…
[whistling]
…Whirly.
[crowd gasping and murmuring]
[cranking]
[Gustafson mutters]
[crowd gasping]
[sputtering]
[crowd exclaiming]
Hey. [chuckles]
- It works! It really does.
- [laughing]
Just a few tweaks, that's all.
[man] He's just an apprentice,
nothing more.
[chuckling] Gustafson
fancied himself a great inventor.
[sighs] You'll see.
[grandmother] But that distinction
had already been taken.
{\an8}[boy] Mr. Jangle,
you've got so many inventions!
[Jeronicus] Oh.
[grandmother]
For his most fantastical invention,
he had been waiting
for its final ingredient to arrive.
And then one day…
Package for Jeronicus Jangle!
Oh! It is!
[grandmother] The key
to unlock his wildest dreams
- and change his life forever!

Mom, I have to get my smock!
We're inventing!
Professor Jangle, you promised
you'd look at my invention.
- [Jeronicus] It's getting there.
- No, no, no, Professor, just two minutes?
Oh, did you calibrate the gyroscopic
stabilization system like we discussed?
- Not yet, but...
- Realign the gimbals?
- No, but...
- Do that. I'll look at it tomorrow.
- Hey, but, Professor...
- [Jeronicus] And man the shop, my boy!
Brilliance beckons. Genius awaits!

[machinery whirring and whistling]
Yes! [chuckles]
[whimsical music plays]

Finally.
After all these years.

It is an honor for you to finally meet me.

- You?

- [Don Juan] Mmm.
- And this…
- [Don Juan] Oh.
- This is my wonderful family.
[Don Juan] Ah!
¡Qué bella, mi reina! [kisses]

¡Cuidado! ¡Cuidado!
- I am fragile.
- I got you.
Mucho mejor.
You can throw roses at my feet later.
Ah.
I like when people stare at me.
I give them something
to stare at in the form of a dance.
[Jeronicus] Everything we dreamed of.
- Everything I promised you…
- [Don Juan] And bow!
…will be ours now.
I believe in you, Jeronicus.
Hello, hello?
Magical toy just came to life!
Focus!
Focus.
- I believe in you the most.
- [Joanne chuckles] Aw.
[Don Juan] ¡Qué dulce!
And I believe in you.
That's why…
I got you… an early Christmas gift.
[warm music plays]
[Jessica] My own inventor goggles.
They're perfect!
[Jeronicus] Now you're an inventor.
I am, Daddy, just like you.
[Joanne] Aw.
Okay, back to me.
- Oh, Professor! You did it.
- [sniffs]
Ooh! Ugh!
¡Ay, Dios mío!
- But how?
- You are very stinky. [grunts]
[Gustafson] Perfect!
Por favor.
Admire me from a distance.
Soon, there'll be a million of 'em.
Huh?
A million of me?
One for every child in the world.
Uno, dos, tres…
Uh… But, but...
I am one of a kind!
We have to celebrate.
Let me get dinner ready.
- Celebrate what?
- Yes, indeed.
Wait, wait. Excuse me!
Wonderful family!
- Gustafson, straighten up everything…
- Uh-huh.
…and take good care
of our new friend…
Sí, señor.
…whose very existence
has changed everything.
- Let's discuss this "million" thing.
- [Joanne] Jeronicus!
[Jeronicus] I'll be right there, my love!
- Eh… ¿Profesor? Yoo-hoo!
- [Gustafson] Professor J, could you...
- It'll be a merry Christmas!
- [Gustafson] You promised...
[Jeronicus] Wait till
children everywhere see this!
[sighs]
I am an inventor too.
Clearly not a good one.
[sniffs] Stinky? Yes.
Good? No.
[laughing]
A million of me?
[Gustafson] Calibrate the gyroscopic
stabilization system. Realign the gimbals.
Who could conceive such a thing?
This is absurd.
I am singular. I am spectacular!
To pull off such a feat, he would need…
"Plans for Don Juan Doll."
[shudders] Ah!
[crying]
¡No, no, no! ¡No puedo!
[Don Juan] Hmm.
[clangs]
[groans softly]
Mmm.
It must feel good
to be such an integral part
of bringing something so amazing to life.
It was, um…
Well, the professor's work really.
I'm just his apprentice.
Sí, pero…
I am sure you've created
something of your own
almost as amazing as me.
After all,
you're an inventor, too.
I've been telling everyone
just a few tweaks is all it needs.
The professor promised
to look at it tomorrow.
The bull waits for tomorrow!
But by then, he is dead.
- We wait for no tomorrows.

Gustafson.
[wind whistling]
[breath trembling]
[young girl] Oh, no!
Is he coming back?
Unfortunately not.
Jeronicus tried to convince
the constables of what Gustafson had done,
but he had no proof.
And so,
Jeronicus, ever the optimist,
returned to what he knew best.
Only, things weren't quite the same.
He couldn't seem to find
the right screw or turn the right gear.
[orchestral music picking up]
And year after year,
the crowds grew less,
the bills stacked high…
[Joanne coughs]
[grandmother] …and Jeronicus watched
as his stolen book of inventions
turned his once loyal apprentice
into the richest toy-maker in the world.
But Jeronicus refused to give up.
Once a great inventor,
always a great inventor.
But the magic, it seemed,
had escaped him.

[grandmother] Jessica tried

But the loss was too great.
And Jessica, too small.
Eventually, it became clear.
She hadn't lost just one parent…
But two.
Broken, defeated, Jeronicus insisted
she'd be better off without him.
And finally…
She granted his wish.
And Jangles and Things,
once a world of wishes and wonder,
was no more.
And Jeronicus Jangle,
the greatest inventor of all,
vowed never to invent anything
ever again.
- The cuckoo inside just doesn't cuckoo.
- [Jeronicus] Mm-hmm.
It's a bit of a family heirloom.
[Jeronicus] Hmm.
Do you have family?
[clattering]
[boy] I'm okay!
[crashing]
I'm okay.
I swept the shop,
wiped down the counters…
And mopped the floor.
Did you clean the pantry?
Ugh!
It would mean a lot if you could fix it.
Of course he can fix it.
I mean, he's the greatest inventor of all.
Children. Active imaginations.

Thank you!

Never coming back.

- She was just delivering my mail.
- Expressing my affection.
In the most respectful way I know how.
Would you mind expressing it
somewhere over there?
Anything for you, Jerry.

You know…
Your cousin is visiting for the Holidays.

Hopefully my favorite cousin.
Nope.
- Mr. Delacroix.

- Jangle...
- Just the person I've been waiting for.
Yes, which is why
you haven't answered any of my inquiries.
Yes, I've been thinking.
Jangle, for the last 30 years,
you've been promising
something sensational.
- Yes, and I have a thought.
- Yes, something spectacular. Hmm?
- Silver.
- [sighs]
You melt it down. It's a 3.5,
but it'll be a 4.5 next year.
- Something stupendous.
- It'll be 5.7 the year after that.
Something that will show the bank
they've made a return on their investment.
Which is why I needed more time.
I can show you.
- We're moving...
- I'm sorry.
- The bank can't wait any longer.
- Just take a look...
- You'll see yourself.
- Listen to me!
Either come up with the money
you've borrowed by Christmas…
That's just days away.
…or show me the revolutionary invention
you once promised.
Something revolutionary?
[loud thud]
- Take the circumference of spectacular.
- [clanking]
Divided by
the second derivative of sensational…
It'll take approximately…
[sighs]
Two thousand years.
It's a big miscalibration on my part.
- The invention or the bank will seize…
- Wait, wait.
- …Jangles and Things and all its assets.
- Mr. Delacroix! Mr. Delacroix!
I would lose everything.
I'm sorry to say it, old friend,
but it looks like you already have.

[grandmother] He had found the one thing
that could change everything.
Here you are.
[grandmother]
But still something was missing.
Someone was missing.
Many times he sat to write…
But Jeronicus
couldn't figure out the words.
I suppose "I'm sorry"
hadn't quite been invented yet.
And though she had moved far away,
the heart, it seems,
isn't bothered by distance,
only by what it loves
and wishes loved it in return.
And Jessica grew weary of the wait.
She had a life of her own now,
and a daughter.
A peculiar little girl.

where can I find Jeronicus Jangle?
- He's right over there.
- Thank you.
[Jeronicus mumbling]
- I'll take this one.
- Twenty pegs.
Are you Mr. Jangle?
Depends on who's asking.
I'm Journey, your granddaughter.
My granddaughter's name is Jackie.
Something with a "U." Justice?
Jupiter? June? July?
It's Journey.
That's a J-O-U. That's with a U. Okay.
My mom told me to give this to you.
"Illumination ignites the integration.
N times between…"
I see.
"Dear Father…"
Allegedly.
Uh, I'd like, uh, one egg, please.
"I've decided to let Journey
stay with you until Christmas."
Journey. Interesting name.
"She's an inquisitive girl,
but well-mannered."
"Like you said, it's time
you both got to know each other."
Did I say that?
When did I say that?
"I'll be there
to pick her up on Christmas morning."
"I hope you are well. Love, Jessica."
No.
My real granddaughter
would never wanna visit me anyway.
But I have nowhere to stay.
Speak quieter,
I'm having a hard time hearing you.
I have nowhere to stay...
You can't stay here. Not now.
Maybe next year, or year after.
Maybe five or ten years from now.
You know what they say about children?
They're a creative vacuum.
I can't have that right now.
I'm workin' on something.
- But...
- Goodbye.
[Jeronicus] Symmetry…

when we talked outside?

She wanted
her own pair of inventor goggles.
"I want a purple band, Daddy."
"They have to have a purple band."
That's what I did.
Her mother thought
she wasn't ready for it, but…
I knew that she was.
You can stay.
Great.

All clauses of confidentiality to protect
the specialty of the personality
whose mentality transcends the continuum

You don't touch, move, bust, break,
you don't take anything from this shop.

Okay, sign it right here.
The pen is out of ink.
Keep going. The pen is full of ink.

You signed it.
You're under contract.

Could you not?
I guess you're right.

Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey! Okay!

Okay.

Well, you hurry back as slowly as you can.

Why won't anyone call me by my name?
[warm music plays]
[grandmother] Jeronicus wasn't the only
one in need of something revolutionary.
Gustafson, too, was searching.
[young boy] Who's Gustafson?
[young girl] He's the one
who stole Jeronicus's book of inventions.
Aren't you even listening?
[dramatic music soars]
[grandmother] Driven by
Don Juan's greed and thirst for power,
- Gustafson's empire soared.
- [all cheering]
For nearly 30 Christmases,
Gustafson unveiled
one stolen invention after the other.
But then, there were no more.
So Gustafson had no choice
but to revisit an idea of his own.
["Magic Man G" playing]
[grandmother] After all,
he was an inventor, too.

I fixed the center wheel
six times on these things.
That's stupid, stupid, stupid.
I'm stupid. I'm dumb.
Okay, the gyroscopic stabilizer's
supposed to…
I'm not reading this right.
Stabilize the gyroscope…
[grunts]
[toreador music playing]
Well, maybe next time
someone will lose an eye.
So they'll never have to see
what a mockery you've become.
If you hadn't forced me
to burn your designs,
I could have mass produced you.
[laughs] And the burden of building
an empire would have fallen upon whom?
I am, and forever will remain,
one and only one of a kind.
I will fix it. You'll see.
Or I will come up
with something even better.
You wanna know why?
Because I'm the Toy Maker of the Year,
- Toy Maker of the Year, Toy Maker…
- [muttering mockingly]
…Toy Maker of the Year!
Lift me!
Do not be afraid.
I want to offer… [kisses]
…sweet words of encouragement.
[grunts] I encourage you
to not be an imbecile!
Your only successes have come
from that book of inventions.
So why not borrow
another one of Jeronicus's inventions?
- Because I have already stolen…
- Borrowed.
…everything in that book.
There is nothing left of him.
There is nothing left
in that pawn shop of his.
Do I need to slap you again?
Because I'm happy to do it, huh? Truly.
Once a great inventor,
always a great inventor.
There is always something left.
- [Journey] So what are you working on?
- [Jeronicus] Couldn't be someone talking,
the only person talking couldn't,
because they're so busy
doing their chores.
- But Grandpa, I don't want to...
- Talking.
- I was just trying to say...
- Chores.
[clocks chiming]
Hmm.
You have to raise the variable
exponentially to the second power.
[chuckles] The other one.
No, that's not possib...
Square root. Derivative would be…
You understand this?
What about…?
This one?
[chuckles]
The circumference of spectacular.
And this? This one?
The second derivative of sensational.
You looked through my notes.
Hey, hey, hey, watch.
Wait till I'm finished.
You're not gonna trick me on this one.
What about this?
That's what I thought.
It's okay.
Well,
it would be
the square root of possible,
but there's a miscalculation.
The square root of possible
is the summation from one to infinity…
Multiplied by the integer
from zero to possible…
Delta-T times the log of circumference,
times one minus theta raised…
Derivative of…
Divided by sin-theta.
From zero to one. Multiplied by
the derivative of theta divided by
the interval from one to zero…
Now it should work.
You can see that?
Can't you?
No.
Not anymore.
- I was just...
- No more talking.
- Just chores.
- But, Grandpa…
Chores. Chores.

Whoa!
"The Jangleator 2000"?
[elevator chugging]
I knew it!
[metallic squeaking]
Ah! Ghost!
[clattering]
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
I'm Journey. Jeronicus's granddaughter.
I'm Edison. Edison Latimer.
Professor Jangle's most trusted assistant.
You wanna be my apprentice?
Do you wanna be mine?
I asked first.
[sighs]
As the head inventor,
I insist we leave at once.
- Not until I find what I'm looking for.
- What are you looking for?
I'll know it when I see it.
You shouldn't be touching
anything in here,
it could do something like...
[loud thud]
…that.
[floorboards creaking]
[wind whistling]
[mysterious music plays]
There is something here.
Why didn't the professor tell me?
It's… it's amazing!
It'll be even more amazing
when I get it to work.
If the professor couldn't get it to work,
what makes you think you can?
Because there's nothing that says I can't.
[Edison] What does that even mean?
[Journey] Wait.
[squeaking]
[warm music plays]
There's something's wrong with it.
There'd be something wrong with you if you
were stuck in a dark room all your life.
It looks like the power source is in
a superposition of states.
We just need something
to collapse the wave function.
- [Edison] Will it work or not?
- [chittering]
[Journey chuckles] Yes.
What are you saying yes to?
Will it work or not?
It's a simple question.
All I request a simple answer.
[Journey] It will work.
At least, I believe it will.
[machine]
It will work. At least, I believe it will.

goes wrong, I'm right here.

- [machine] It's okay.
Come on.
[machine] Whoa!
Whoa, it's okay.
[birds chirping

Easy.
[Edison] Be careful.
My name is Journey.
[machine] I'm Buddy. Buddy 3000.
[chuckles]
And this is Edison.
- [thuds]
- Ow!
I'm okay.
[Buddy] Ow! I'm okay.
Hi!
[Buddy] Hi! Edison. Hi!
Why didn't you work for my grandfather?
[Buddy] I've always worked.
Just needed someone to believe.
[echoing]
That's it.
[Buddy] That's it.
Belief! It collapsed the wave function.
It must have been part
of Grandpa J's formula.
It works.
[Buddy whirring]
Because we believe.
Of course we believe.
He's hovering above your head.
He's hovering above your head!
Mommy!
[Buddy] Mommy!
[mumbling]
[Buddy giggling]
Mommy!
Mommy!
Be careful.
[Buddy] Belief, belief, belief.

What the…?
I'm actually flying!
- Buddy.
- [Buddy] Actually flying!
Whoa!
What's happening?
How is this possible?
Edison, just let go!
[Buddy] Let go!
[Buddy giggling]
[whimsical music soars]
- [Journey] It'll be all right!
- It's not gonna be all right!
- Whoa!
- [Journey] Whoa!
[whimsical music climaxes]
[gasps]
[Don Juan giggles] Bingo!
[Jeronicus] Who's there in my workshop?
[gasps]
[Buddy] Less belief!
- [Jeronicus] What are you doing up here?
- [Edison coughs]
What have you done?
I told her not to touch it,
but she's not a very good listener.
The contract clearly stated
you were not to touch, move,
bust, break or take
anything from this shop!
- Do you remember?
- I didn't move it.
You expect me to believe
it got up and walked over here?
Well, actually,
he flew.
That's not possible.
Watch. I'll show you.
Like this.
You see?
You see? I told you. It doesn't work.
He does. You just have to believe.
Professor,
you really are
the greatest inventor of all.
I'm not an inventor.
And you're not an inventor either.
[Edison sighs]
But, Grandpa...
Enough already, okay?
Enough.
Nothing would make me happier
than if this worked.
He does. You have to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.
I would not lie to you, Grandpa.
- I need you…
- Please!
- I need you… to go to bed.
- I don't want to go to bed.
I want to stay up here
and fix this, please!
- Please!
- Good night.
- All you have to do...
- Listen to me!
Go!

If I know anything about your grandfather,
Jangles and Things
is stirring with something sensational.
Something… spectacular.
It's just a pawn shop.

You and I…
- Both know there's something in there.

You can tell me.
Perhaps I could market it.
Or mass produce it.
For him.

In the pawn shop.

Mrs. Johnston.
I've been looking for you all day.
You always come by the shop.
Something wrong? Is everything all right?
Jerry!
What a surprise! [chuckles]
What's the problem?
Are you all right?
- [softly] Yes! Yes!

This isn't…

Oh.

How did that get there?
Mrs. Johnston, I don't…
[chuckling] I don't have time for this.
I just need you to collect my boxes.
I know. I know!
You have boxes that need collecting.
Everyone in Cobbleton
has boxes that need collecting!
Only they've all gone for the holidays
to be with their families and…
loved ones.
Um…
Focus.
Mrs. Johnston, focus.

I… I think you have to push the latch.
[Ms. Johnston] Come on.
- [Jeronicus] Good job.

Mrs. Johnston? It's just that
I need this taken care of today.
- Happy holidays, Jerry.
- I'm going out of business, Mrs. Johnston.
- It's supposed to start snowing. [laughs]
- I'm closing the shop in a few days.
- How about a time?
- I hear your granddaughter's down.
Oh! Grandchildren are like children,
only you can give them back.
- Could you give me a time of day?
- [chuckling]
- Just… No.

It's fine, Jerry. I've got it.

What happened?
Gustafson started bragging
that he was the greatest inventor,
- and the professor hadn't...
- Edison, tell me you didn't.
I'm the worst apprentice ever.
I mean, you're a bad apprentice,
but not even close to how bad I am.
- Buddy!
- Ow! I'm okay.
Where's Buddy?
I think I hear my mother calling me.
Did you hear that? I did.
- Here I come!
- Edison!
Huh?
- We have to get Buddy back.
- Yes.
You absolutely do.
[Ms. Johnston] I'm still working.
- [Journey] You thinking what I'm thinking?
- [Ms. Johnston laughing]
If I say no, will you stop thinking it?
[man] That's a lovely truck.
It's new! I'm still getting used to it.
I almost only killed one person today.
[laughs] Progress!
[epic music plays]
[grandmother] Journey would stop
at nothing to rescue Buddy,
her only hope
of saving Jangles and Things,
- and her grandfather as well.
- [Edison grunts]
We can't go through there!
[Journey] Whether you think you can
or think you can't, you're right.
[Edison] What does that even mean?
The buyers are here? Again?
[groans] Did you not learn
your lesson from the last time?
We saw it with our very own eyes.
[chuckles] It's foolproof.
Ah! You are proof that there are fools.
Fools, fools, fools, fools…
Fools.
Journey? Edison?
Didn't I tell you not to play in my shop?
[sighs]
What have you done?

[man] I now present to you
the premier proprietor
of playtime products,
and 28-time Toy Maker of the Year.
Excuse me.
Sir, have you seen my granddaughter?

[man] A man whose
artistic excellence is unparalleled.
She's wearing…
the cogs and screws in her hair.
[man] Whose brilliance
defies all logic and explanation.

We are simply waiting for it to warm up.
I was working
on the housing last night, and, um…

Hello?
[woman chuckling]
Now… Oh, no, don't miss it.
'Cause you don't wanna miss it.
This is going to be amazing.
The wow factor alone
will knock your socks off.
- [Jeronicus] Mrs. Johnston!
- [truck horn honking]
- [Ms. Johnston] Jerry!
- Can you take me to Gustafson's factory?
I could be persuaded, I'm sure.
No bother. I'll just walk.
Oh, Jerry! Lighten up. Hop inside.
It's Jeronicus.
My name… is Jeronicus.
When you're walking, it's Jeronicus.
When you're riding with me, it's Jerry!
- [Jeronicus mumbles]
- [Ms. Johnston whooping]
- Might've be tight. I've used tin cogs…
- They don't believe.
…Instead of copper cogs.
It makes the product more light,
which is easier for transportation
when you bring it into your homes
for your children,
during this holiday season.

Twenty-eight-time Toy Maker of the Year.

Box this wretched thing up and send it
where we send all ill-conceived toys.

No, to the crusher.
[man] The crusher?
[Gustafson] Yes! The crusher!

[Journey] There he is.
I'll distract the guards

- [Ms. Johnston] Me again!
- Why are you back here?
[Ms. Johnston] Well, you see, I, uh…
I forgot to deliver these, didn't I?
Oh! Silly me.
You know what it's like,
being Christmas and everything.
All these things go back and forth.
Parcels, gifts, letters, you name it.
[frantic choral music plays]
[Edison] The guards!
They're right behind me!
[Journey] Come on!
We have to get back to the tunnel!
You're doing great, Edison!
[Edison] You're lying!
Your hair, as shiny as a stallion's mane.
Your eyes, the azul of the sea.
And your bumpies,
with the burn of a fresh-picked
habanero that's just about to...
- Do not finish that sentence, please.
- [door opens]
There are kids in the factory.
They've taken the crate with the robot.
Who cares?
It's a failed invention. Let 'em have it.
Hijo de la…
If it were failed, then why
would they be trying to recover it?
They wouldn't!
[Don Juan] Kids in the factory!
Stop them at once! Kick their shins.
Pull their hair. Twist their arms!
Stop them at once!
[alarm blaring]
[Journey] Hurry.
[fan powering up]
[both grunting]
[Edison] Oh no!
- [Journey] What happened?
- [Edison] It's broken.
[fan revving]

- [Jeronicus] Edison?
- [Edison] Professor?
Grandpa J!
[Jeronicus] Journey, are you all right?
- Yes!
- No!
- Yes!
- No!
We're fine!
We've got Buddy.
We have to get him out of here.
Okay. I want you to turn back right now.
Right now! At once!
I'll meet you at the gate.
[fire whooshing]
Fire!
[echoing] Fire!
Grandpa J, there's a fire!
We have to go through the blades!
Journey, listen to me!
You cannot go through the blades!
It's impossible! That's impossible!
That's it!
The square root of possible! That's it!
- The square root of possible!
- It's just a theory!
A formula in my mind!
- It's not been tested!
- We trust you!
We don't have a choice!
It's a theory!
[groans]
[female voice] We have tracked
the intruders to a fire in the east tower.
We have tracked the intruders

- Kick it in!
- Yes, sir.
[echoing] Grandpa J, just believe!
[ethereal choral music playing]
[blows]
[dramatic music builds]
[gasps]
Okay.
Stay there. Stay there.
[Jeronicus's voice
calculating indistinctly]
Okay.
Velocity.
Centrifugal force. Point of inertia.
[all screaming]
[guards shouting indistinctly]
[Journey] Hurry!
Okay, 45 seconds.
No!
[Jeronicus's voice
calculating indistinctly]
Wait a minute.
1,500 feet.
Okay.
The blades are movin'
at 500 revolutions per hectosecond!
You have to get caught
in a current of the blades,
which'll sync with the speed
of the crate in the path of inertia.
You have to enter at a 35-degree angle
at exactly 1,500 feet per minute!
You will make it through!
Okay, Grandpa J, I love you!
I love you, too, Journey!
Let's go!
[Edison grunts]
Edison,
we don't have time for this.
There's a fire.
Come on! Let's go!
[Edison] Just for the record,
this is not a good idea!
[both screaming]
[thrilling music soars]
[Journey] This is so cool!
[Edison] This is not cool!
This is ill-advised!
- Duck!
- [gasps]
That was close.
Watch out!
It's getting close!
Whoa!
This is crazy!
Edison, you just have to believe!
[Edison]
There's no logical reason I should…
- [powering up]
- …but I do!
I do!
[Journey] You have to slow us down!
We can't slow down!
[Buddy] Slow down!
- [Journey] Buddy!
- [Edison] How does he do that?
[Buddy groaning]
You're going too fast! 35 degrees!
[Journey] Buddy!
[Buddy exclaims]
[both screaming]
- [Jeronicus] No!
- [screaming]
[both screaming]
[shrieks]
[grunts]
Are you all right, Edison?
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
Journey! Edison!
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Grandpa J!
[groans]
Grandpa J, your formula, it works.
[Edison] Professor!
[panting] I came up with
a steering mechanism made out of rope
that got us through the tunnel alive.
Well done, Edison.
Quite the inventor.
Just like you.
Well, if hugs are going for free…
I wouldn't say no.
Mrs. Johnston?
You came back!
A good postal woman
always ensures a safe delivery.
Children, Jerry, come on!
I'll get the truck, you get the crate!
[Gustafson] Open the gates!
[menacing march music playing]
[Jeronicus] Mrs. Johnston? I really
need you to keep to the left of the road!
- Left is good. Right is bad.
- [Ms. Johnston laughing]
"It's a failed invention."
"Let them have it."
[huffs and yells]
- [Jeronicus] Get outta the way!
- [honking]
If you value life, get out of the way!
We're here. You can stop now.
[Ms. Johnston whoops]
[Jeronicus] Great job.
- Here we go.
- [Journey sighs] Yes.
[Jeronicus] Careful.
- Watch your step. One more.
- [Ms. Johnston] Okay.
- Thank you, Jerry. Okay.
- [Journey] Here we go.
[Edison's mother]
Edison, it's time to come home!
Edison, come on,
we're about to put Buddy together.
My mom is calling me, so…
I've got to go.
Thanks for helping me rescue Buddy.
I couldn't have done it without you.
We both know that's not the case, but…
Thanks for saying it anyway.
[sighs]
Journey, I really,
really do like you… a lot.
Bye!
[crashing]
Ow! I'm okay!
[Journey sighs]
Buddy.
[warm music plays]
Thank you.
I don't know why you came back.
[chuckles softly]
Because you're a good man.
Stubborn. Ornery.
[chuckles]
Could benefit from a good haircut,
a new set of clothes, but…
Still good.
Jeronicus…
I know about losing things.
But the magic
isn't just in what you've lost.
It's in what you still have.
- Mrs. Johnston?
- [engine starts]
Ms. Johnston…
[engine idling]
Oh.
Look what I found here.
I forget how you use these.
[chuckles]
It's been so long.
I think you…
Place it over someone's head.
- [chuckles softly]
- Like so.
And lean in for a kiss.
[kisses]
Like so.
Uh…
Ms. Johnston?
Ms. Johnston, can you hear me?

[sighs]
Grandpa, you have to fix Buddy.
You have to make him work again.
Please.
[footsteps approaching]
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You're the greatest inventor of all.
You can do anything.
It's why I came here.
I had to see it for myself.
You're here because your mother
wanted you here.
That's what she wrote in her letter.
Because I wrote her one from you
saying the same thing.
Why would you do such a thing?
All she ever talked about
was how magical this place was,
and that you could see things
that nobody else could.
Like I can.
Everywhere I've ever been,
I felt out of place.
This is the only place
where I've ever been
where I finally felt like I belong.
Journey…
A child with an imagination…
Always belongs.
Never be afraid
when people can't see what you see.
Only be afraid… if you no longer see it.
Okay?
I love you, Grandpa J.

Daddy…
[tool clatters]
Jessica?
I thought I'd come
to pick Journey up early.
I hope she hasn't been
too much of a bother.
It was nice of you
to even wanna spend time with her at all.
Actually, I never...
Never could have imagined
she'd be such a delight. [chuckles]
And… and she's quite the inventor.
[chuckles softly]
She must have gotten that from you.
Or you.
[sighs]
We should leave now,
if we're to make it by morning.
Jessica, I'm sorry.
For what?
For giving up?
For making me feel it was my fault
that things turned out the way they did?
Do you know how many times
I went to my mailbox
hoping for something…
To let me know that you still cared?
That you even thought about me at all?
I thought about you…
Every day.
[Jessica scoffs]
Every day.
[warm music plays]
Given everything that happened,
I wasn't sure you wanted to hear from me.
So, I didn't send these letters.
"I wanted you to have the world."
"Reach into the heavens,
pull down the stars
just so they could shine on you."
"Not just read about a happily ever after,
I wanted to be the one to give it to you,
Jeronicus Jangle,
the greatest inventor of all,
only wishes he were…"
"The greatest father of all."
[chuckles]
Journey reminds me so much of you…
And your mother.
I wanna be there for her
like I should have been there for you.
I mean…
Maybe…

I love you so much.
I love you, too, Daddy.
[delicate warm music plays]
[crying]
I'm gonna…
I'm gonna go wake up Journey,
if you don't mind.
Say our so longs and goodbyes.
If she's asleep, we could stay.
Or maybe take… take a morning train.
Or…
Maybe we could spend Christmas here?
If it's all right with you.
That will be... It'll be all right with me.
[chuckles]
[sniffles]
[chuckles]
Is that…?
Wow!
- The Buddy 3000.
- It's really him.
What's left of him.
I was hoping to
put it back together for Journey.
She's taken quite a liking to him.
If we start now, maybe…
Maybe we could put it together by morning.
[warm music continues]
Symmetry and synchronicity.
[Jessica]
Which is the stability of it all.
- [Jeronicus] You've been reading my notes.
- I think you've been reading my notes.
[Jeronicus] I have.
So good to have you back.
I'm gonna need something…
[warm music rising]
[Jessica] Thanks, Dad.
[crowd chattering]
[Jessica] Make sure to open the heart.
I forgot about that.
[tool hissing]
- Got it?
- Got it.
[Jessica mumbles]
- Hey!
- [laughing]
Grandpa J, I…
Mommy.
[chuckles] Grandpa J, you did it!
- [Jeronicus] Had a little help.
- Mommy…
Hello, baby.
Had a lot of help.
From both of ya.
[all chuckling]
Now, all we have to do is turn Buddy on.
[Journey sighs]
Okay.
I believe.
Come on. Come on, Buddy.
I… believe.
[powering up]
[Buddy] Believe!
Just needed someone to believe.
Buddy?
[Buddy] Jeronicus!
You're alive.
[Buddy] Alive. Yes!
Good to see you, Buddy.
[Buddy laughing]
[warm uplifting music playing]
I'm glad you're here.
[Buddy] Glad to be here.
[loud knocking]
[man] Jeronicus Jangle!
Gustafson?
Well, hello, young lady.
- What is the meaning of this?
- Please!
The robot that you stole from me.
To the dungeon with him!
- Yes, you.
- I demand that you arrest him at once.
- Right now.
- For what?
You're the real thief.
A thief couldn't have these.
The designs
for the robot that I slaved over.
Restless days and sleepless nights.
I wanted to give up
so many times, but I didn't.
- I…
- [Don Juan] We.
…persevered knowing that one day,
- I…
- We.
…would realize my dream.
Proof in black and white.
And blue.
¿Azul?
"Property of Jeronicus Jangle."
Explain this at once.
I don't… I…
- It's an easy explanation...
- I can explain.
After I ran into Mr. Gustafson,
I was afraid he would try
to steal The Buddy 3000,
so I marked the design.
For proof.
Uh-oh.
Just arrest Mr. Jangle.
You told me those were your inventions.
Did you lie?
Are you a thief?
Yes, you.
Jeronicus, save me!
[Jeronicus] I'll take the matador.
He's my invention after all.
I am home!
- What?
- [Don Juan] Mi rey…
I've missed you!
I like your hair.
Did you do that yourself?
Finally…
- Children everywhere will love you.
- [Don Juan] I am extremely lovable.
[chuckles] Puppy-dog eyes.
Baby kitten eyes.
- After I reprogram you.
- Reprogram? Reprogram what?
I am and forever will remain
one and only one of a kind!
[powering down]
[constable] We've got the wrong guy.
Come on.
Why are you here, sir?
This doesn't make sense.
You will take the word
of a ten-year-old child?
I'm a respected member of the community!
Are you kidding?
Look at that child!
She has evil in her eyes! Don't you see?
How did you get on the force?
- You know...
- [Jeronicus] Wait.
I have something for him.
- I had it for you that night.
- [Gustafson] What?
But then you were gone.
[paper rustling]
A gyroscopic stabilizer.
For your Twirly Whirly.
I would have shown you everything…
If only you'd waited.
I…
Come on. Move.
[Delacroix] Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
Mr. Delacroix.
Merry Christmas, old friend. Ladies.
I'm sorry it's come to this.
[whirring and whistling]
[gasps] What? What in heavens…?
It's something sensational.
- Yes!
- It's something spectacular!
More than that!
[both] Something revolutionary!
- It's The Buddy 3000.
- The Bud… The what?
[Buddy exclaims]
- [Jessica] It's a robot.
- Beg your pardon?
A flying robot.
- Is such a thing possible?
- Hmm.
[Buddy] Something sensational.
Something spectacular.
Something revolutionary!
[Delacroix] It talks?
It talks.
It talks.
[both chuckle]
[Buddy chuckling]
You talk.
[Buddy] I do.
By Jove, Jeronicus, you've done it.
You are a genius, old friend.
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, no, no.
- If I know anything…
- Some people call me brilliant.
- [both chuckling]
- …there's more where that came from.
- I have 30 years of notes.
- Then I have no doubt!
Oh, look at you!
I'm going to bally well kiss you.
- We're kissing now.
- From now on,
whatever you need, the bank will give.
- For the rest of your life.
- Okay!
- [Delacroix] He's a genius! Spectacular!
- [Buddy] Genius.
It's a merry, merry Christmas indeed!
Go in, go in! See for yourself!
[Buddy] A merry, merry Christmas indeed!
- What's happening? Buddy? Put me down.
- [Buddy whooping]
[Buddy] Let go!
[Jeronicus] Whoa!
Grandpa J, just let go.
Let go of what?
[Buddy laughing]
[Jeronicus chuckles] Oh!
[Jessica] You're flying!
[both laughing]
[upbeat music playing]
[inaudible]
[Jeronicus] I said the same thing!
Follow me, Buddy. Come on.
[indistinct chatter]
- Hey, everyone!
- [Buddy] Hello!
Jangles and Things is open for business.
The world of wishes and wonder.
Jerry! Oh! You get down
from there this instant!
Hey, Edison!
Up, up, and away!
[Jeronicus laughing]
[grandmother] And everything that was
stolen from Jeronicus was returned to him.
And they laughed and sang,
and danced, just like those flames.
[gentle music playing]
Keep looking.
See them now?
You can see them, too?
You didn't think you were the only girl
who could see things, did you?
[gentle music playing]
You're Journey.
Yes.
- [gasps]
- So Jeronicus Jangle is
- our great-great...
- Great-great-grandfather.
Yes.
Yes?
Yes.
[all chuckling]
Why didn't you tell us before?
Well, I had to wait for the right moment,
when you needed it the most.
When you… [sighs]
…were ready for the magic.
Because it's been ready for you.
[Buddy] I'm okay.
- Hello, Buddy.
