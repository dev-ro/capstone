- Good evening Mr. and
Mrs. North and South America,
and all our ships at sea,
let's get a fresh flesh-- -flash!
Congress today has called
an emergency session,
but as yet no one has shown up.
And the President refuses
to issue a statement,
having locked himself
and the Vice President
in his bath-room early this morning.
However, the First Lady
urges all, and I quote,
"Seek comfort in the Bible," unquote.
A bulletin just in, the
world's top scientists
are holding a conference
in Washington, D.C.,
awaiting a statement
from Professor Gordon,
world authority on animal
behavior and renowned physicist.
- Gentlemen, we are in big trouble.
- Sex madness perils planet!
Extra! Read all about it!
Sex madness perils planet!
Get it now, read all about it!
Sex madness perils planet!
Hey, scram you horny jerks!
- Gentlemen!
As I have told you,
we are in big trouble.
I think there is no need
for me to describe to you
the incredible chaos our beloved planet
has been plunged into.
Of the disgrace-ful acts
which are being committed
at this very moment!
In every apartment,
on every street corner,
or on the rooftops!
In grass huts in the
jungle, in igloos in the Arctic.
In airports, in markets,
in movie houses, in the parks!
Yes, we are in big trouble.
- Doctor Gordon...
all of us here are aware
of the total degradation
that has overcome the masses,
but what are we going to do about it?
What is causing it?
- Now I say it's a virus and
we must find a vaccine for it!
- It is not a virus,
any fool can see it's a
case of mass hypnosis!
- Hypnosis-- ha! I've done research
and traced the cause to
cans of bad Passover tuna.
- Tuna fish, tuna fish!
This guy's got mercury on his brain!
- Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, we must be calm!
Future generations are depending
on decisions made here today.
Now, I have discovered three
things about this madness.
Number one, not all areas are affected.
Look around you, are anyone
of you sexually aroused?
- Yes, ha-ha-ha!
- Anyone of you, huh? No!
Not all areas have been affected.
Number Two, my son,
who has been rep-resenting
United States at the tenth
international ice hockey
playoffs in Tibet,
has discovered what appears
to be a great beam of light
proceeding from some far off planet
whose appearance is simultaneous
with the first occurrence yesterday.
Number three, I discovered my wife...
in bed with the garbage man.
- But what about your son, professor?
Did he find anything else out?
- Yes Professor, what are
you holding back from us?
- What's the scoop?
- My son is at this very moment,
'on his way back to this country
and as soon as he has landed...
we shall all find out.

we gotta get to a telephone.
You see, we were flying
along in this airplane from Tibet,
when suddenly we were hit
by this sex ray from outer space.
And this unrestrained sex orgy ensued,
which both of the pilots joined in.
When I noticed the plane was going down,
I took over the controls
but they broke off in my hand.
So you see the young lady,
nearly overcome with sex madness,
and myself, bailed out just
before the plane crashed.
And we landed just over there.

Do you think I don't know
you've come here to steal
the secret plans to my new Interstellar,
Hydrocombustion, miracle

And employs a new updraft design,
which lifts the ship on small spirals
of synthetic strontium pellets.
Do you think I don't know that!
Well, I've never even heard of it.
So you're barking up the wrong tree.
Come here, young lady.
I would like to conduct
a little experiment,

that exposure to the sex ray,
increases the size of the secondary--

Dale Ardor, this is Doctor Flexi Jerkoff.
How do you do?
- So you see, I've actually
discovered which planet
the sex ray is coming from,
and fortunately, the straddle
ship was ready just in time.
Oh, you can't know

Fortunately, the rocket was
completed before that happened,
