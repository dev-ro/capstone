Take it easy, Blue Boy,
your supper will be here any minute.
I wish I knew
what was keeping that fella.
Dad?
Daddy, I just had Mr. Kramer
on the phone.
He said Dave Miller stopped by
1 0 minutes ago...
-...to put water in his radiator.
-Thanks.
Margy.
-Have you finished your packing?
-Not yet. I was just going to.
I don't know what's got into you.
All you do is sit around and mope.
I don't sit around and mope.
Well, stop moping now
and finish your packing.
Always saying she doesn't know
what's got into me.
I'll be glad to get to the fair.
Hear something different.
See something different for a change.
What has got into me, anyway?
-Margy.
-Yes, Mother.
Soon as you're finished, come down
and help me with the pickles.
In a minute, Mother.
Pickles.
-Margy.
-I'm coming, Mother.
Come on, boy.
He'll win first this year, sure.
He's half again the hog
he was last year.
You don't really expect to win, do you,
with that animated lard can?
Say, listen, you can say anything
you please about me...
...but don't say anything bad
about Blue Boy.
That's the finest Hampshire boar
that ever breathed.
If you think that, then he's
just as good as beat now.
Be better if he was third or fourth best,
you'd stand a better chance.
-Oh, what are you talking about?
-lf a hog or a man...
...ever got what he was entitled to,
just once...
...the eternal stars would quit making
melody in their spheres.
Oh, there you go
with that book talk again.
I say he's the best hog in the state,
and the judges will say so too.
They might. But if that turns out good,
then something else probably happen.
He might catch pneumonia
or hog cholera.
Or you might catch pneumonia.
Or something might happen
to Wayne or Margy.
Mark my words, Abel.
There's compensation in this world.
For every good, there's bad.
Now, Ralph Waldo Emerson tells us--
I don't care
what Waldo Emerson tells us.
Look, I'll just make a little bet
with you.
-On what?
-I'll bet you...
...we go to the fair
and Blue Boy will win the grand award.
And nothing bad will happen
to him, me or my family.
Yes, and we'll all have a good time too
and be better off for it...
-...after the fair is over.
-It's a foolish bet, Abel.
If you'd asked me,
I'd have given you 1 0-1.
But you didn't ask me,
so it's an even bet. Five dollars?
Five dollars is right.
I'll be around for the money
the day you get back.
-Be around with the money, you mean.
-You'll see, you'll see.
Yeah, I'll see.
Well, well, what's this?
You got your chains on.
You're expecting a shower?
Nope. I'm expecting good weather.
That's why I put my chains on,
so I wouldn't be fooled.
Do you want your name "Mrs. Abel
Frake" or "Mrs. Melissa Frake"?
Melissa Frake, I guess.
With your father entering Blue Boy...
...the judges might get us mixed.
Hog cholera. Pneumonia.
He left out earthquakes,
the old doom-spreader.
Poor Dad.
-I don't know.
-Let me taste.
-Don't taste like Grandma Stidge's.
-I followed her recipe.
I'll get it.
-You left something out.
-Abel Frake...
...I am not going to put liquor
into my cooking.
Making mincemeat without brandy?
No such thing.
I don't approve of it,
and I won't do it.
Well, you'll be sorry.
You know those judges at the fair...
-...they like a snifter now and then.
-Eleanor, for Wayne.
-Wayne's out back somewhere.
-I'll find him.
Why don't you say hello to Eleanor, Ma.
See how her mother is.
They had the doctor again today.
I suppose I should.
-Find out if she's going to the fair.
-Yes, I will.
Hello, Eleanor. How are you, dear?
How's your mother feeling?
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry I couldn't get by
to see her today...
...but I've been so busy,
getting ready to leave and all.
Oh, well, I'm glad she's better, dear.
Wayne'll be here any moment.
Hold on.
And be sure to give my love
to your mother.
Thank you, dear. Goodbye.
Abel? I need a good-sized box or carton.
Something to carry my pickles in.
Know just what you want, Ma.
I'll get it for you right away.
"A third apple, molasses,
binding sugar, lemons....
Two parts good brandy. "
No, I won't.
-Eph, where's Wayne?
-Wayne? Oh, he's back there in the barn.
Thank you, mister.
And now I think I'll have a try
at that fancy brass clock.
Yes, that one.
-There we are.
-Wayne?
There's a nice string of pearls.
I'll have a go.
-Oh, I know they're fakes, but--
-Wayne.
What are you doing?
-How long you been there?
-Oh, just a little while. I--
Why didn't you say something
instead of standing there?
Who were you talking to?
Does Mother know you have
her embroidery hoops here?
Look, just leave me alone, will you?
Stop prying in other people's affairs.
Speaking of affairs,
Eleanor is on the phone.
Eleanor? Well, Christmas,
why didn't you tell me?
Eleanor's on the phone.
Hello, Eleanor? How are you, honey?
What'd the doctor say
about your mother?
Well, I don't know what to do, Wayne.
The doctor says she's a bit better, but--
Oh, but, Eleanor, you've got to go.
I've made a lot of plans for us.
What?
Margy, my dear little Margy,
I'd make the world a ruby
for your little finger,,,
,,,and say, "I love you, I love you,,,
,,, I love you, "
Margy, you are beautiful,
You are so very beautiful,
Margy.
Hello, Margy.
Hello, Harry.
No, l' m not mad.
I' m just disappointed.
Well, I'll see you when I get back.
Goodbye.
Gee, I wish I was going to the fair
with you tonight.
I'd rather be doing that
than anything I know.
Oh, would you, Harry?
Well, sure.
Only, I can't neglect my cows.
Oh, of course not.
-Say, I saw something today.
-What?
The sweetest bit of farmland
this side of Davenport.
I was thinking of putting a bid in on it
if you like it.
-lf I like it?
-Well, sure.
You know I haven't made a plan since l
was 1 2 years old that didn't include you.
-Got a house on it?
-Yeah, but it's too old.
-We'd have to build a new one.
-Oh, I like old houses.
Well, it wouldn't fit in
with our kind of farm.
You know, I plan to do everything my
old man won't let me do on his place.
Scientific irrigation, electric milking,
separate henroosts, no horses.
All tractor power. You see what I mean?
Everything modern.
-But the house you live in--
-It's gotta be the same.
No old clapboard-and-shingle business.
There's a new kind of plastic
prefabricated job. I want you to see it.
Got the catalog home.
-ls it pretty?
-Sure.
But what's more important,
it's termite-proof.
Wait till you see it.
They tell you how to furnish it too.
No rugs or carpets.
They're just dust collectors.
-What's on the floor?
-Linoleum.
Through the whole house.
Wait till you see the pictures.
It's-- It's slick and smooth
and easy to keep clean.
Well, it's like every room
in the house was a bathroom.
-Sounds real cozy.
-Y eah, don't it, though.
-What I've always wanted.
-Oh, sure. It's the only way to live.
-Everything sanitary.
-Sure, and if we had children....
-Oh, Margy.
-I said, if by any strange chance...
...we had children, why, I could dress
them in cellophane rompers.
Say, I didn't know they had--
Life will be just ducky.
Plastic.
What's the matter, honey?
Oh, nothing. Just restless, I guess.
Sure, I understand.
You like to travel.
Well, I figured we'd make a little trip.
California or Bermuda or....
If it was May, we'd go to Washington,
see the cherry trees.
-A honeymoon?
-That's what.
I'd almost marry you
to make the trip, Harry.
Oh, no kidding now, Margy.
What do you say?
What do you say?
Well, l-- I won't say anything
just now, Harry.
-Well, after the fair, maybe?
-Maybe.
Look at him, Marge.
Holy cow.
He gets bigger every time I see him.
-Biggest boar in the world, I bet.
-All depends on how you spell it.
Eleanor can't go.
-Where's your mincemeat, Ma?
-Right here between my feet.
-ls the top on tight?
-Certainly it's on tight.
-Why?
-Oh, nothing.
Just don't want the flavor
to escape, that's all.
Get your place. Fat man, skinny man,
fire-eater, strongman.
This is the biggest state....
Here you are.
Curious folks are always....
-Hello, Mrs. Frake.
-Hello there.
-How are you?
-Just fine.
-Be down as soon as we get settled.
-Yes, do that.
If Wayne doesn't come back soon
to take me around, I'm going by myself.
I do wish your father'd come
to his breakfast.
If he'd rather stay with Blue Boy
than eat, let him.
But I've got my whole day planned out.
Don't you know
you can't plan a whole day?
-There's no such thing.
-I do it all the time.
You sound just like Harry. He thinks
you can plan out your whole life.
So you can.
Is that what he was
talking about yesterday?
Did you come to anything definite?
I'm sure I don't know
what you're waiting for.
It would serve you right if Harry up and
married that Skidmore girl instead of you.
-I almost hope he does.
-Me too.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
Move in a little closer. Don't be afraid.
Hurry. Hurry. Try the game.
Three rings for a dime
and prizes worth up to $20.
Positively no blanks. The prize
you win is the prize you get.
The prize you take away.
Don't any gentleman
want to try his skill?
Ain't nobody here
got the pioneer spirit?
I tell you what I'm going to do...
...I'm going to put down three
nice, new, crisp $1 bills.
One here, one here and one here.
Now, who'll spend a dime
for three chances at $3?
-ls that real money?
-lf you win them and don't like them...
...I'll give you a dollar apiece for them.
Hey, mister,
them hoops look mighty small.
-Do they fit over those things?
-Lots of people do it, sir.
-Lots of people do it.
-Yeah, I did it last year. Remember me?
-I won a pearl-handled revolver.
-Well, now, there, you see?
Young Mr. Daniel Boone won a revolver
off me right at this very fair a year ago.
Bring down any grizzly bears
with that shooting iron, sonny?
T ell you what I'll do with you, I'll just
give you three rings on the house...
...to start things off.
Three chances for nothing.
I can't win, I can only lose...
...but I love the game.
Remember, young man, you are enjoying
the courtesy of the house.
Don't cost us money.
I just lost $2.
But I'm having fun. I love the game.
Here, my boy,
I want you to have a fair shake.
-That ring looks warped. Try this one.
-This one's all right.
Well, well, you all see how easy it is.
Who else wants to try?
I'll try again. Here's a dime.
-Who else wants a chance at a big prize?
-Here, mister, here's my dime.
You, sir? You look like
you've got a good aim.
-But you got a customer.
-Give me three rings. Here's my dime.
Give him a fair shot.
All right, buddy, here you are.
-You didn't put any dollar bills back.
-Ain't pearl necklaces...
...and safety razors
good enough for you?
Can't you enjoy the game for the
game's sake? Are you money mad?
Those prizes are all fakes,
but I'll win them anyway just to prove it.
Quite a character.
Step up, folks, we're having fun here.
Just lost a pearl necklace.
But I'm laughing.
I love the game.
The young man is winning a fortune.
Here you are, buddy.
Look, pot metal molded in one piece.
What good's a vanity
that won't open?
Okay, you had your fun.
Now, come on, move along.
Those clocks don't have works.
What good are they?
-You know what I'm paying for this?
-No, what?
More dough than you'll ever see.
So you spend a dime, take $3 in cash...
...then tell the public
my prizes are no good.
-They're just a lot of junk.
-Look, you, I've been nice long enough.
-Now, beat it or I'll call a policeman.
-Why don't you.
-What's that?
-I said, why don't you call a policeman.
He's only trying to bluff you.
The law says he's got to sell you
all the rings you want.
-Otherwise, you can close up his place.
-Oh, smart dame, huh? A law student.
You listen to me, arsenic
and glamour, I don't know who you are--
I'll tell you who I am.
My father's the chief of police here.
-Your father is--?
-The chief of police.
I was standing here
and saw the whole thing.
Say, how did you get so good at this?
It's a silly thing to be
good at, isn't it?
But he made me sore last year.
I was trying for one of those revolvers...
...and cost me about $8. When I finally
did win, it wasn't a revolver at all.
It wouldn't even shoot.
It was just a toy.
-Defrauding the public, huh?
-Now, wait a minute.
I wouldn't have minded, but he kidded
me in front of the crowd. So l--
You practiced all year
just to get even?
I figured I'd come back, make as big
a fool out of him as he made out of me.
-No, you don't.
-Will you give him his $8...
-...if he promises to lay off?
-I don't care who your father is.
-Okay.
-Here. Here, here.
Here's your 8 bucks,
and you don't come back, see?
Is it a deal?
-You think it's all right to take it?
-Well, sure, it's all right.
Here you are. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh, don't leave, folks, prizes up to $20.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,
we're having fun here.
Gee, it was swell of you
to stand up for me. Thanks.
Oh, that's all right.
He had it coming.
Well, now that you helped me
get my money back...
-...how about helping me spend it?
-That won't be necessary.
-What about a fancy custard?
-No, thank you, I believe not.
-Hot dog?
-No, I have an appointment.
-I'm late already.
-Will I see you? How about tonight?
-Will you be on the midway?
-T onight?
-Yes. I think so.
-I hope so. I'll sure be looking for you.
-Do that. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
You sure you won't change your mind?
How about some popcorn?
--from start to finish.
This is the biggest state fair
and all the curious....
Get tickets now if you care to ride.
The train's now here, ready to leave.
Get your tickets for this ride.
All aboard if you care to ride.
-The train is now--
-One, please.
Keep your tickets for this ride.
For the longest, the highest,
the fastest...
...the safest ride at the fairground.
Get tickets now
if you care to ride.
Hey, Pappy,
there aren't any seats together.
Say, mister, do you mind sitting
in the seat behind?
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
-All aboard.
-Okay.
There they go.
-Hold your seat. Hold your bar.
-Watch your hats, folks.
They're off on a race
through the clouds. A thrill a minute.
Sit down!
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?
I'm sorry.
Haven't you been on one
of these things before?
Not since I was a little girl.
-I used to be afraid of them.
-But you're not now?
That's what I wanted to find out.
Here comes another dip.
It's nearly over now.
Here's the tunnel.
Johnny! Stop that.
Everybody out, folks.
Everybody out.
-I'm going around again.
-You gotta have a ticket.
Press pass.
-The lady going around again too?
-No, thanks. I've had enough.
Take this ride at the fair.
Get tickets now for this ride.
--or if you go and get tickets
for this ride.
Get tickets now
if you care to ride.
Three rings for a dime. Hurry.
You feel safer down here?
-I thought you were--
-I changed my mind.
Standing there
watching you walk away...
...every step you took, your hair bounced
up and down on your neck. Rather nice.
I don't know if that's what got me,
but here I am.
Now it's your turn to say something.
-What can I say? I-- I don't know you.
-Well, I can arrange that.
And all you know about me is that my
hair bounces up and down when I walk.
-Everybody's hair bounces up and down.
-Mine doesn't.
I mean, girls.
The old-fashioned string game....
Well, look over there.
Well, maybe it wasn't your hair. Maybe it
was the way you held your shoulders.
-Walk away again. Let me see.
-All right.
Hey. Hey, wait a minute.
-Where you going?
-You told me to walk away.
-Yeah, but l--
-I have to go.
-Why?
-Well, l--
Well, what?
What are you afraid of?
-I'm not afraid.
-Good. Then what'd be wrong...
...with you and me exchanging
our ideas of life over a Coke?
Nothing wrong. It's just that--
I'm not saying it's a great idea.
What's bad about it? What can we lose?
Let's give it five minutes.
What do you say?
Here we are. Two people who
know nothing about each other.
Maybe we should.
Maybe it'd be fun to find out
what we're like.
-Maybe it'll be dull.
-What do we do if it's dull?
-Break it up.
-How do we do that?
One of us just says, "Let's break it up. "
That's the end. You go east, I go west.
No hard feelings,
no questions asked. Agreed?
Agreed.
Okay. Here we go.
Hold on. Here we go!
You tried to get....
Now, with roller coasters,
that's different. They're fun.
You ought to see the one in New York.
The one in Chicago is pretty good.
There's one in Los Angeles,
it's not bad...
...but the one in New York, that's
the one. It's got a dip of 200 feet.
-You've been everywhere, haven't you?
-Not yet.
Oh, when I first started out,
I worked on different papers.
But now I'm afraid the great Des Moines
Register's got me hog-tied.
-Someday I'll work on a bigger paper.
-l' m sure you will.
I think I better go
the rest of the way alone.
I'd have a pretty hard time
explaining you to my folks.
Yeah, I guess you would. Everybody has
a hard time explaining me.
-See you again?
-Well, l--
-Would you like to say, "Let's break up"?
-Oh, no.
Well-- Well, I mean, do you?
Look, bobbylocks.
Don't worry about me.
Any time I wanna throw in the sponge,
you'll know it. I just won't be around.
Well, I don't know what
the family's plans are for tonight.
-I don't know where I'll be.
-I'll find you.
-How?
-I'm a newspaperman.
It's my job to find the right people
at the right time. You'll be seeing me.
So long.
So long.
What's the matter with you?
What's the trouble, Blue Boy?
Ain't you feeling good?
This ain't like you, son.
Ain't sick, is he?
Sick? Oh, no, no, no.
He-- He's in fine shape.
Just had a long trip.
Kind of resting up a bit, that's all.
-I thought he was sick.
-Oh, no. He's never felt better in his life.
You see what a spectacle
you made of yourself?
What are people gonna say about you?
-Hello, Hank.
-Hello there.
-What you got this year?
-She'll put anything you got in the shade.
You wait and see.
Come on, get along there.
Get along.
-Hello, Hank.
-Hello there, Frake. How are you?
-You got a duroc this time.
-Yes, and a good one too.
-Get in there.
-She's got nice color.
Well, she ought to have.
Her mother before her was the most
beautiful red sow in the whole world.
-What's her name?
-Esmeralda.
And she'll win the sweepstakes, sure.
Now you look like something.
I don't mind telling you, though,
you had me worried, son.
But I knew you'd come through.
Now you look like a real champion.
-Excuse me.
-Why don't you look where you going.
Gawking around, people think
you've never been to a fair before.
I thought we might meet
somebody we know.
So what?
Why are you looking around?
Who are you looking for?
Oh, I sort of had a half date
with a guy I met here last year.
-Why don't you keep it.
-What would I do with you?
-Look, Wayne--
-I beg your pardon, sir.
-May I trouble you for a match?
-Sure, I think I have some right here.
-That's very kind of you.
-Okay.
-Here you are. Thanks.
-Why don't you keep them.
My brother has another pack.
-Oh, sure. Sure, go ahead, that's okay.
-Thank you very much.
Certainly big with my matches.
Well, what do you care?
Your pockets are always full of them.
Look, Wayne, if you wanna
keep your date with that friend...
-...I wouldn't mind.
-You wouldn't?
No, I hardly slept a wink
in that old truck last night...
...and what I wanted to do
was to go to bed early...
...but I didn't wanna
disappointment you.
Oh, don't worry about me.
Maybe you'd better,
you do look a little tired.
-And I can get back all right.
-Oh, that's swell, sis, thanks.
-I mean, get a good rest, now.
-I will.
Hello.
Pardon me. I'm looking for
the chief of police's daughter.
-Have you seen her around anyplace?
-His daughter?
I don't believe I know her.
There's the chief over there.
Why don't you ask him.
Okay, thank you.
-Good evening, chief.
-Good evening, what can I do for you?
Can you tell me where your daughter is?
I had a date to meet her.
-What?
-Well, it wasn't exactly a date.
She said-- I mean, I told her that--
Well, let's see.
She's around here somewhere.
Oh, Violet.
Yes, Daddy?
This young gentleman tells me you two
have a date to go out stepping tonight.
-Well, I guess I must mean her sister.
-I haven't got a sister.
Looks like someone's been pulling
your leg, my boy.
Y eah. That's a pretty good joke on me,
all right. Well, thanks.
How many, please?
-How many tickets?
-One.
And now for your favorite, the lovely
Emily Edwards and "That's For Me. "
-There you are.
-Thank you.
-Who is that singing?
-That's Emily Edwards.
She's kind of cute,
but she's not my type.
She's a redhead.
Now, with brown hair, that's different.
-Hello, Pat.
-Hi, Pat.
-Hi, girls.
-How you doing, honey?
Quiet, you.
I guess you know a lot of girls,
don't you?
Well, in my racket, you know....
-I just spoke to your father.
-My who?
Your father, you know,
the chief of police.
Oh, that.
Didn't you know I was kidding?
Well, I do now. And just for that, you're
gonna have to have a drink with me.
When I saw you, I couldn't believe
you were the same girl.
-Why not? Was I that bad?
-I didn't mean it that way.
You were good. Wonderful.
That's just it, a girl singer like you
with Tommy Thomas' band.
I couldn't figure out why you went
to all that trouble today for me.
-Why not? What's wrong with you?
-Well, nothing wrong with me.
I mean, well, maybe there is,
but don't tell me.
Like to dance?
Do you?
Sure. That's why I brought it up.
-Sure. We can get our drinks later.
-All right.
The big feature ride of the fair. Come
and get your tickets for the next ride.
This is the highest, fastest,
safest ride at the fairground.
Get tickets now
for the big, fast ride.
-Come on, I dare you.
-I'm game.
-How many?
-Two, please.
Next ride.
-What you thinking about?
-Why?
You sort of had a funny smile
on your face.
You really wanna know?
Well, I was just thinking about
you practicing all that time...
...with your mother's embroidery hoops
just to get even with somebody.
You think I'm kind of screwy,
don't you?
No, I don't. I don't at all.
As a matter of fact,
I like that kind of a fella.
That's lucky for me, because I like the
kind of a girl who likes that kind of fella.
Say, you're pretty good
in that voice department yourself.
I'm an old glee-club boy.
Hey, cut that out.
I'll get you for that.
You wait and see.
You two sound like you had
a wonderful time.
-Sure did.
-Terrific.
I wish your father was enjoying himself
instead of brooding over that old pig.
Say, I thought you were going to bed
early last night.
Oh, well, I was going to,
but I changed my mind.
I went for a ride in the roller coaster.
It's much better than it was last year.
Okay.
I tell you, he's raring to go.
When I left him just now...
...he was strutting around
prouder than a peacock.
-You'd think he owned the place.
-Maybe now you'll give me a little time.
Yes, sir, he's all right again.
Wait till you see him.
There ain't a hog ever was
or ever will be that can touch him.
For what we're about to receive, O Lord,
make us duly thankful. Amen.
-You said grace before, Dad.
-Yeah.
I did? Well, I'm gonna
keep on saying it all day.
I just hope he stays like he is
till the judges see him.
Why, they hardly tasted them.
And I like my sweet pickles best.
Oh, they don't have to taste much,
they're experts.
Don't be so jittery, Mother.
There's that Mrs. Metcalfe.
-Behind the lady in the red hat.
-Oh, yes, I see her.
So biggity.
Why, she was just lucky last year.
Her pies weren't half as good as yours.
-Well, hello, Mrs. Metcalfe.
-Hello.
Pardon me. Going to win
all the prizes again this year?
I don't know about all the prizes...
...but I have high hopes for
my pickles and mincemeat.
Same as you.
Look. They like your sour pickles.
This is the last year
I'm ever gonna enter anything.
-lt isn't worth it.
-Oh, Mother, you say that every year.
Please.
Number one award goes to....
Number two....
Thank you.
Well, aren't they going
to announce their decision?
Not until they finish with
the mincemeat.
Thank you.
I don't remember telling you
to cover this part of the fair.
Oh, hello, boss.
Thought you were specializing
in human-interest stories on the midway.
What's wrong with putting in a plug
for the housewives?
That, my friend, is Mrs. America.
Do tell.
And what dainty putter-upper
of what delicious preserve...
...is the cause of your presence?
Forget that you're the managing editor
of a newspaper and try to act intelligent.
You ever seen me with a type
who's a good cook?
No. I've seen you with every other kind.
You had to get round
to these sometime.
Shove off, let me finish this story.
It's for your paper.
Sure, only I hope it's better than
the one you turned in last night.
"Fun on a Roller Coaster. "
You'd better hope the old man
misses that one...
...or he'll never give you a shot
at that job in Chicago.
That's yours, isn't it?
Do you think they liked it?
They must have.
They certainly ate enough.
Your attention, please.
Silence, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Quiet, please!
We are now ready to announce
the awards. Sweet pickles:
First prize to Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe
of Pottsville.
Second prize...
...to Mrs. Agnes Field of Arcadia.
Sour pickles:
First prize...
...to Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick.
Oh, you won.
Second prize to Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
quiet, please.
As you know, we occasionally give
a plaque for distinguished achievement.
As you are doubtlessly aware...
...this plaque is only given
in rare cases.
And on this occasion, my colleagues
and I have voted unanimously...
...that it be given to a lady who has
concocted the most delicious...
...the most succulent
and spiciest mincemeat...
...ever entered in a state fair.
The lady who wins this distinction...
...is none other than
Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick.
Oh, Mother.
I've got the most a woman
can get in life, Margy.
-lf I think any more about it, I'll cry.
-Stand where you are, please.
Hold it. Thank you.
Thank you, ladies. Your picture
will appear in the Register tomorrow.
Good day.
-See, Mother, you're famous.
-I'm worn out.
I'm going up to the trailer
and lie down.
I never knew what a strain it was
to get something you really wanted.
-I'll take these, dear.
-My hat too.
Yes, now, you run along
and enjoy yourself.
My horse is number eight, Tessie B.
In the green shirt.
Come on, Tessie, come on.
Get up there, come on.
Attagirl, Tessie. Pass her. Pass her.
Attagirl, Tess!
-Hey, she made it!
-She won! She won! Your horse won!
It can't be much fun for you...
...just hanging around here,
waiting to catch me between songs.
Can't think of anything
I'd rather be doing.
Anyway, we can-- I mean, can we
go someplace after the show?
I thought maybe we'd have
something to eat or something.
Well, I can't tonight, Wayne.
It's Marty's birthday.
-Who's Marty?
-The boy I sing with in the band.
We're giving a surprise party for him.
Wouldn't you like to come?
Well, I was kind of counting on
being alone with you.
I know. I'd like that better too. But this
is a party we cooked up a week ago.
We're giving it in my rooms at the hotel,
so I can't very well back out now.
Hey, Emily.
-They're playing the introduction.
-All right, Marty.
Now, don't go away, I'll be right back.
Okay, let's go.
-Listen, I got the greatest number here--
-McGee.
-lf you ever scare me again--
-I got the greatest number I ever plugged.
-And I'm gonna give you first crack at it.
-Buzz off, McGee, we're busy.
Just like all singers.
They don't like songs.
-Hi, buddy.
-Hello.
-You in the music business?
-No, I'm a farmer.
A farmer.
What a night in heaven.
-You're a friend of Emily's, ain't you?
-That's right.
-My name's McGee.
-My name's Wayne Frake.
-You in the music business?
-Yeah, I'm a song plugger.
I work on songs
till they get popular.
"Work on them"? I thought songs
got popular because people like them.
Oh, that's naive. How can people
like a song if they don't hear it?
You gotta get the big singers to sing it.
-How do you do that?
-There's all kinds of ways.
And none of them is easy.
You got no idea what a schnook has
to do to get a song on the hit parade.
Last week I fell down in front of Dinah
Shore's taxi just to talk with her.
Every Christmas I gotta remember
to send Sinatra a new bow tie.
When a bandleader's wife
has a baby...
...I gotta stay home with it
on the nurse's night out.
It's a question whether
"Mairzy Doats" would've been a hit...
...if I hadn't known
how to change a didy.
-ls that a new song you got there?
-Yeah, and it's a honey.
A natural for your friend Emily.
You wouldn't wanna help me
get it to her, would you?
I am not at all niggardly
when it comes to the old payola.
-Payola?
-It's a technical term. Forget it.
The man who wrote this song is
starving in an attic in Brooklyn.
His wife ran out on him,
left him penniless with two kids.
She even took the piano with her,
so now he can't write no more.
If this song ain't a hit, there's only
one thing left for this man:
The river.
On the other hand, if somebody was
to get a great artist like Emily Edwards...
...to introduce it
with the band on the radio...
...this man's fortune would be made,
and his genius preserved for posterity.
How do you know
he ain't a Stephen Foster?
-Well, I don't--
-Just read those words.
Here, take a couple of copies. I'll hum
the tune so you can see how they fit.
Follow me.
Right there.
Hey, where's my drink?
Let's see what else they got here.
Look, Wayne, how about
your singing a chorus?
No, thanks. You're doing all right
without me.
-I want them to hear you.
-You can't be as good as she says.
-You'd be surprised. Come on.
-No. No, really.
Come on. Don't tell me
we have to coax you.
How about singing a rousing corn-fed
ditty you guys sing around little towns?
-Come on, sing anything you like.
-Y eah, you can't tell.
You might have
something we can use.
As a matter of fact, if you need a song,
I've got one right here.
How do you like that? He didn't expect
to sing, but brought his music with him.
-Would you like to try it with me?
-No, no, you do it yourself.
Did you write it?
No, I didn't. A fella gave it to me.
Okay, bud.
Okay, bud.
This ought to be something.
You know, you're right
about that song, Wayne.
-I like it too.
-You do?
Billings Publishing Company, huh?
-A guy named McGee give you this?
-Right.
-How much he slip you for plugging it?
-Wait a minute.
-Nothing.
-Said he'd come through with the payola?
-Yes, he used that expression.
-I'll bet he did.
Well, that's great, Emily,
your boyfriend here cashing in on you.
-Oh, I thought they were kidding.
-How do you like that?
Wayne.
Wayne.
Wayne, wait a minute.
I'm sorry, Emily. I just couldn't help it.
He's been putting in digs
since I got here.
I know he was asking for it,
but please don't go.
You don't think I'd cash in on
being friends with you, do you?
Of course not. And he wouldn't have
said it, only he's had a few drinks.
-Please come back.
-Oh, it just wouldn't work, Emily.
I'd let him have it as soon as
he opened his mouth.
Look, why don't you walk around
the block.
Give me a chance to get rid of them.
How about that, huh?
Well, I hate to have you
break up the party.
I'll tell them I have a headache.
When you come back, we'll be alone.
That's the way you wanted it, isn't it?
-Okay. How long?
-Come back in half an hour.
Emily, l--
-Half an hour?
-Make it 1 5 minutes.
All right.
Only a few stars left.
Yeah, and they look kind of tired.
It's funny how a day creeps on.
So slowly at first
you think it's never coming.
Then, all of a sudden, it spreads out
over the sky and the sun starts shining.
People loom up like that too.
Are you really gonna go home and
marry that guy you're engaged to?
That's what girls usually do, isn't it?
Marry the men they're engaged to.
Yeah. They're usually sorry afterward.
Think you'll ever marry?
Who, me? Sure. Sometime.
Trouble is, if I ever found a girl
that I cared that much about...
...I'd care too much about it
to wish a guy like me off on her.
Sounds kind of hopeless.
Guess it is.
It's pretty hard for me
to picture myself...
...what do they call it,
"popping the question. "
Can you imagine me suddenly
turning to some girl and blurting out:
"Will you marry me? "
Oh, l.... I can see you wouldn't.
Well, bobbylocks, you've
made a very wise decision.
Anyway, I'd be no good for you.
No good at all.
Of course, you'd be
awfully good for me.
What about your old man's hog? Aren't
they gonna judge him this afternoon?
Oh, yes, I guess I'd better be going.
-Wayne's probably in already.
-It's getting pretty late.
-Don't you want me to go with you?
-No, it's better if you don't.
-Will I see you tonight?
-At the roller coaster?
Eight-thirty.
Well, l....
-Good night, honey.
-Good night.
-Pat?
-Yes?
I was only talking. I couldn't marry
anybody but you ever.
Well, Blue Boy, this is the great day.
Your hour of judgment.
Now, take it easy there, now.
Don't get your face dirty.
Look, Mother, Blue Boy's already won.
There's his blue ribbon.
Oh, that thing?
That's only the class award.
He's won in his class of senior boars.
I'm getting him ready...
-...to go in for the Grand Championship.
-ls he all right, Abel?
All right? Why, just look at him.
Yeah, he's fit as a fiddle.
Class 51 Hampshire senior sows,
pavilion number two,
Better go in now, son. Get seated.
-We go in after this.
-We better get going.
-Good luck, Pa.
-Thanks.
-You too, Blue Boy.
-Thanks.
-We'll be pulling for you.
-All right. Bye. See you later.
Well, let's see.
Is your face clean, son?
Yes, you're all right.
You gotta look your best, you know.
You taking her in, Hank?
No, not yet. Just taking her out
to put her on a scale.
Blue Boy. Well, what's the matter, son?
Oh, you think Esmeralda's gone home.
No, she's just gone out to be weighed.
Hampshire boars get ready, please,
That's us, son. Come on, get up.
Oh, don't act this way.
Esmeralda will be back, I tell you.
She ain't gonna be judged
until after you win.
Come on, boy, get up.
You hear that? That's the band playing
for you. You can't lay down on me now.
Oh, come on, fella, please.
Attention, please. Attention.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I have the honor...
...of introducing to you
a man whom you all know:
Congressman James A. Goodheart.
During this great day of boar judging...
...you have seen hundreds
of seemingly perfect boars eliminated...
...Ieaving only two contestants:
The Junior Champion and the Senior
Champion, both perfect specimens...
...representing excellence of breeding.
The judges realize the importance
of their decision...
...for the boar they decide is the better
will be acclaimed...
...Grand Champion Boar
of this year's state fair.
Introducing the first contestant:
Whirlwind, number 1 88.
Winner, Junior Champion Boar.
Owner, Mr. R.C. Martin.
-He's awful big, isn't he?
-Blue Boy will outpoint him.
And now for the second contestant.
Introducing Blue Boy.
-Where's Dad?
-Yes, now what?
-Where is he?
-lntroducing Blue Boy.
Number 1 494.
Winning Senior Champion Boar.
Owner, Mr. Abel Frake.
Go, Blue Boy. Go, go.
Whoa, Blue Boy.
Whoa, Blue Boy.
Whoa, Blue Boy.
They didn't look at him very long,
did they?
They'll be back.
Blue Boy, get up. Get up on your feet.
The judges will see you.
Oh, this is terrible. He'll lose, sure.
Get up, Blue Boy. Blue Boy.
Come on, son, get up.
Son.
What's the matter with him? Get him up.
We can't judge him lying down.
Come on, Blue Boy. Get up, will you?
Blue Boy, come on.
Blue Boy, come on.
Come on, son, get up.
Come on, Blue Boy, get up, will you?
Blue Boy, come on.
Blue Boy, come on.
Just a little tired, that's all.
Attention, please. Attention.
I have the honor to announce the winner
of this year's Grand Championship:
Hampshire boar Blue Boy.
This gives me great pleasure, Mr. Frake.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Oh, Pa.
Congratulations, Mr. Frake,
congratulations.
My, my, whoever wrote this
must be a friend of the Frake family.
"As Mr. Abel Frake won the grand award,
he was watched from the grandstand...
...by his charming wife and talented
and beautiful daughter Marguerite. "
-Come on, Wayne, it's getting late.
-Just a minute.
Say, you look mighty pretty tonight.
Is that a new dress?
-Do you like it?
-Prettiest girl I ever saw.
-Okay, I'm ready.
-Not too late, now.
-We want to get an early start.
-I might be late. It's the last night.
-So long, Dad.
-Bye.
So long.
-They look nice together, don't they?
-What'd you say?
-I said, we had two lovely children.
-Well, who said we didn't?
Wish Margy would
make up her mind about Harry.
Why? He won't run away.
He's one of those goody-goody boys.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
You were a good boy
when I fell in love with you.
That's what you thought.
Well.
Since you're such a gay dog...
...you'd better take me to the midway
for a little fun.
-No, Ma, you're all tired out.
-Who said I was tired?
Say, here's something interesting.
It's about that judge,
the fella that gave you the plaque.
It says here how he had
a kind of seizure afterwards...
...delirium tremens, sort of.
"While Mr. Hippenstahl
was unconscious...
...he kept murmuring something
about mincemeat.
Those nearby declared they could smell
brandy on his breath. "
You fool.
-Just for that, you've got to take me out.
-Oh, no, Ma.
I've got that nice tired-out feeling.
-You and I are going to the fair.
-I've seen the fair.
You've seen the hog pavilion.
-Are you going to get out of that chair?
-Now, Ma.... I'm out.
Now, go on in and change your clothes.
Go on. I want some excitement.
That's right.
What do you think of this
imitation champagne?
First time I ever tried it
and I love it.
It's as good as that
French champagne any day.
-Did you ever taste French champagne?
-Nope.
Who's that little runt?
What's he grinning at?
That's Mr. Hippenstahl,
the pickle-and-mincemeat judge.
-Well, that explains it. He's drunk.
-Abel.
-Come on, let's get out on the midway.
-All right.
Hey, buddy. I wanna thank you for
the plug you gave that song last night.
It's all set with Tommy Thomas
for Emily to sing in Chicago tomorrow.
-Chicago?
-Yeah, their next date, the Palmer House.
I'm going with them on the plane.
Sticking with them
so they won't change their mind.
Emily didn't say she was--
I didn't figure on them leaving tonight.
Sure. Right after the show.
I wish she'd hurry up
and get out here. I wanna talk to her.
Kind of went overboard for each other,
didn't you, kid?
-Kind of.
-She told me.
Oh, they all tell me everything.
You going back to the farm soon?
-T omorrow.
-That'll be good.
Come in.
-Oh, hello. I was just on my way out.
-I'll say you are.
-Where's your suitcase?
-Suitcase? What for?
The old man just phoned from Chicago.
He's gonna give you a crack at that job.
-The eastern syndicate?
-That's right. A column of your own.
-I can't believe it.
-He's leaving in the morning...
...and he wants you to fly
up to Chicago to talk tonight.
-The 8:30 plane.
-How much time have I got?
Practically none. I'm holding a taxi
downstairs. I'll get your shaving things.
-Hey, wait.
-Yeah, what's the matter?
I can't leave now, I've got a girl
waiting out at the fair.
-What'll I do?
-Do? Get another girl, in Chicago.
"A girl waiting at the fair. "
I break my neck getting this for you,
and you start yapping about some girl.
-It's different. It's not just a girl.
-Yeah, I know.
She's wonderful. Only girl in the world.
I suppose this job is just a job.
Kind that comes up every day. Look.
I wanna make something very clear
to you, sonny boy. The old man is funny.
When he wants you to be someplace,
you better be there.
-Yes, I know that.
-Do you want this job?
Now, you got just about two minutes
to make up your mind.
-What'd she say?
-She sees lots of money coming my way.
-Good, I can use some.
-I don't think it'll do you much good.
She says I'm going to marry
three times.
Here they are, folks,
the eight fugitives from the Follies.
They did a little dance in New York,
but the police commissioner objected.
He demanded that they take
certain things out of the dance.
Understand? Well, rather than do
the emasculated version...
...they come out here to give you
the original dance with nothing cut out.
Just to prove to you what
you're going to see on the inside...
...okay, Mike, let her rip.
Do you want to go in?
Of course, it means nothing to me...
...but if you'd like to see it,
I'd be glad to take you in.
What do you think, huh?
Of course, like I say, it means nothing
to me unless you wanna go in.
You do? Come on.
Two, please.
-Enjoying yourself?
-Yes, we are.
That's good.
What's that old buzzard doing,
following you around?
Don't be foolish, Abel. He's seeing
the fair, having fun, same as we are.
All aboard, train now leaving.
Get tickets for this ride.
Another train coming in, get your tickets
for that high, fast ride through the sky...
...on the big roller coaster,
the big feature ride of the fair.
Come in, get your ticket.
But last night and all the things
we said, was that just kidding?
-No, Wayne, it wasn't just kidding.
-Well, it certainly wasn't with me.
I thought that....
Oh, what's the difference
what I thought.
But, Wayne, darling,
I thought you understood that--
Well, after all, we were just two people
who met at a fair--
And fell in love, didn't we?
Well, that was something
I hadn't bargained for.
Wayne, will you believe something,
just one thing?
It's every bit as hard for me
to give you up...
-...as it is for you--
-Well, then why do it?
Why give each other up?
Come with me, meet my father and
mother and go home with us tomorrow.
Because I can't, Wayne. I--
-Hey, Emily, you ready?
-No, she isn't.
I'll be right in, Marty.
Wait here, Wayne.
I have to tell you something.
Something I should have
told you before.
And I would have if--
If I hadn't been such a--
A coward.
Please wait, Wayne, please.
Do you mind if I say something?
-Such as what?
-First, let me get something straight.
When you said that about taking Emily
home with you, did you mean the works?
-Wedding ring and all?
-That's it, the works.
And that's the way it's gonna be.
Look, I'll give it to you quick.
She's married.
She's got a husband, see.
They don't work at it very hard.
They split up about a year ago.
He claims he's a songwriter,
but he's just no good at it.
As a matter of fact,
he's just no good, period.
She liked him, though.
Sort of knocked her out for a while.
Come to think of it, you're the first guy
she's looked at since then.
I guess I just don't understand
the people in your business.
Take my word,
they're the same as anybody else.
They make mistakes, sure.
But don't everybody?
Are all the people
in your town perfect?
-Why didn't she tell me?
-She told you why.
She didn't wanna spoil everything.
Maybe she figured she had a right
to a little happiness too.
You know what you and me
need right now?
A drink.
How about it, buddy?
Ring it this time. There she goes.
Forty-seven, how high...?
Forty-eight. Very good.
-Who's next, folks?
-Not bad. Not bad at all, Mr. Frake.
-Not bad, huh? Thank you.
-But you didn't ring the bell, though.
I know I didn't ring the bell, though.
Who can? Can you?
I don't know, I never tried.
-Well, why don't you.
-I don't know but what I will.
Step right up, neighbor.
Step right up.
-It's kind of heavy, isn't it?
-Allow me.
Now, I suppose the idea
is to lean your weight on it.
Yes. Put all your 1 20 pounds in it.
Come on, Ma, I'm tired.
Let's go home.
I suppose it's too late to stop
someplace for a cup of coffee.
Oh, who said it was too late?
Easy does it, pal. Easy does it.
-I'm okay.
-Sure you are.
What about this Eleanor,
the girl from back home?
You say you graduated
from school together, huh?
Yep. She's a fine girl, too.
-What does she look like? Redhead?
-Nope, blond.
Oh, I like the redheads.
There's a redhead lives on
the floor below me. What a dish.
I keep thinking I'll get off the elevator
at the wrong floor, but I never do.
Why not? Why don't you?
What, and have my wife
make a cripple out of me for life?
One shoe off
and the other shoe off.
Diddle, diddle, dumpling,
my son John.
Hey, that don't rhyme
like it used to.
Did I ever tell you about Eleanor?
She's a girl I went to school with.
-Wonderful.
-Yeah, I know. I know.
Just the girl for you. Wonderful girl.
Look, bobbylocks,
don 't worry about me,
Any time I wanna throw in the sponge,
you 'll know it, I just won 't be around,
-You about ready?
-Y es.
-See you next year.
-Y es, indeed. We'll be here.
-T ake good care of yourselves.
-We will.
All right, son, get aboard.
-Bye.
-Bye.
I can't remember
when I've been as tired.
It's that resting you did at the fair, Ma.
Three days' rest will tire anybody out.
-Goodbye, Hank.
-Goodbye, Frake, see you next year.
You bet.
For goodness sake,
what's the matter, Margy?
You're crying like there was never gonna
be another fair. We'll be back next year.
-I never wanna see another fair.
-You can say that again.
You meet people who play you for a
sucker and have laughs at your expense.
And when the fair is over, what?
-Just chalk it up to experience, I guess.
-Sure, that's why you go to a fair.
Experience. Something new, different.
Yes, sir, the Frakes are coming home
in grand style.
You got your plaque, I got the Grand
award, we're all well and happy...
...and Dave Miller owes me 5 bucks.
Now, here, here. There you are. That's
Melissa's plaque for her mincemeat.
And this is mine, first prize
for the best boar in the state.
So you see, gloomy Gus,
you lost your bet.
Nobody got sick
and nothing bad happened to any of us.
Only thing is, something might've
happened we don't know about.
None of that, now.
Come across, $5.
-Lemonade, Mr. Miller?
-Yes.
Thank you, Mrs. Frake, believe I will.
Would've done your heart good
to hear them in church today.
Everybody talking about the Frakes...
-...and all the prizes you won.
-Well, that's nice.
See you later.
-I won't be home for dinner.
-All right, son.
Where you going?
Oh, just for a little drive.
Did Wayne have a good time?
He looks a little down.
Had the time of his life.
-Mr. Miller? Abel?
-Thank you.
No, no. Not now, Ma.
Headache better, dear?
How about you, Margy?
Did you have a good time at the fair?
Answer that, Margy.
It's probably Harry for you.
Well, go on, dear.
Don't let it ring all day.
-Well?
-Let's not be hasty about this, now.
Hello.
Say, doesn't anybody ever answer
the telephone?
Pat. Oh, Pat. Here?
In Brunswick?
Oh, yes. Y es, I do. I do, Pat.
That's all I wanna know.
You're going back to Chicago with me.
You're gonna be the wife of a columnist.
Yeah. Say, how do I drive out
to your place?
Well, where are you now?
Is your car pointed toward the hotel
or the Elks Hall?
Well, get in and keep it going
in that direction.
Just keep going until you see me.
Oh, yes, and hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
Margy, you didn't answer my question.
Did you have a good time at the fair?
Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Miller. It was the most
wonderful fair in the whole world.
There.
-You see, what did I tell you?
-Margy.
Margy, that's Mr. Miller's car.
Well. Well, she'll be right back, I'm sure.
Five dollars.
Oh, Pat.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hi.
