- We'll get to that tomorrow.
Huh?
Put it back in the pantry.
- Could've said that earlier,
before I broke my back.
- I told you five minutes ago.
- Yeah, sure you did, jackass.
Let me guess, your girlfriend
is getting on your nerves
and making you do your homework.
I'd like to pound
a couple of beers, you know?
Loosen me up
before the recording.
- Yeah,
beer helps you play better?
- Makes you sing better.
- Funny.
- What the fuck are you doing,
man?
- I'd kind of
like to season it tonight
so the flavors soak in better.
- Leave it till the morning.
- Still,
I want it to taste better.
- Shit, is it bad?
- Not that bad.
- Jackass.
- Okay, Max, could you
kick a test for me, please?
A little louder, please.
Not that loud.
- I'm not the fucking drummer,
all right!
Where is that fucking idiot?
- Do you want to call him again?
- No, I don't want to
call him again.
This band is going nowhere, man.
- Can we try it again, please?
- Okay, that's enough.
Thank you.
- Hey, Robby,
how much more time
do we have left?
- About 45 minutes.
- All right, if we cut out now,
will you give us
a small discount?
- When you book time here,
you pay for time here.
Your recorded product
is incidental.
- It's not cheaper
when you got to work with
a jackass, jackass?
- Shut up, man!
- Hey, Robby,
when can we book again?
- Uh, next Thursday,
after midnight.
I can give you the same rate.
- Yeah, we're not going to have
the money by then,
but I'll call you.
- Where the fuck were you,
you douche bag?
- Max, don't start.
- I'm 15 minutes late.
What's wrong with you, man?
- You, you retard!
Where were you last night?
- I was with Amanda.
- Oh, the yeti.
- Shut up,
at least I'm getting laid.
- Yeah, by a fucking yeti.
- What's up your ass, man?
Why are you attacking me?
- We had studio time,
booked and paid for!
- All right, Max, come on.
Let's get to work.
- Oh, man, I am so sorry.
I totally forgot.
- Oh, man, I am so sorry.
I totally forgot.
I was fucking a yeti.
- All right, both of you,
come on, get to work.
- You need to talk,
with your fucking girlfriend.
- Max.
- Seriously.
What's the fucking point?
- Shut the fuck up!
Get on with it.
Shit!
When are they gonna switch these
knobs the right way around, man!
And that smell
in the locker room,
it smells like his ass.
- I stopped calling
about that stuff.
The county board
is more interested
in football fields
than Sans Asylum.
- They're gonna
phase this place out?
- I wish.
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Hey, J.B.
- Smells Indian.
- Smell a lot of Indians,
do you?
- So what is it?
- It's a shredded chicken
in a creamed curry sauce.
- It's not too spicy, though?
- No, it's pretty mild.
- By the way, the meat people
are delivering
tomorrow morning.
You need to be here
pretty early.
- Oh.
What time?
- 7:00 a.m.
- No, I'm playing with them
tonight!
I told the office!
- I'm sorry, George.
- Fine, I'll be there.
- What about you, Ricky,
are you gonna be there tonight?
- [chuckles]
- You guys set to go?
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm gonna call them in.
- Ricky, you get the plates.
- File up against the left wall.
- You heard J.B., file up.
Let's go.
- Take one tray from the stack,
one plastic fork and spoon
from the basket.
- Here comes Sleepy.
- Pass your tray
through the window.
Thank the cooks
when they serve you the meal.
One at a time.
Stay in line.
- Give me more, man.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Here's Mr. Happy.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Have a good day, man.
More man, more.
You're welcome.
- Yellow.
- Hey.
- Yellow.
- Hey.
End of the line.
Hey. Hey.
[clattering]
You've been reaching through
there, right?
I see you reach through there
again,
I'll put you on liquid lunches.
You got that?
End of the line.
- Now.
- You guys all right?
- Uh, yeah, we're fine.
[soothing music continues]
Okay, guys, come on.
Hey, Pete.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Pete.
- Harry Green's
got a crush on you, man.
- Lynn?
Lynn, I need-- I need a towel.
- Just a sec.
- I'm soaked.
- Not working hard enough.
- Lynn?
- I'm coming.
Oh shit.
- God, man, it's cold.
- You nervous?
- Yeah.
We've changed the set around,
and with my finger,
I hope I can pull it off.
- I'll pull you off.
- I'm sorry I can't come.
- Don't worry, you've got
a ton of papers to grade.
- Yeah, but I never
missed your show before.
What if I'm
your good luck charm?
- Then maybe I'd better grab
some good luck now.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No, I got to go.
No time for a quickie.
Come on.
I got to go.
I might violate you later.
- You better.
Good luck.
- Well, that sucked.
- Yeah, man.
- Hey man, take that.
Get out of here, all right?
You got an early start.
We'll finish up.
- Are you serious?
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
- Come on, asshole.
Why does all that shit
come out of your mouth?
- Forecast today,
showers and thunderstorms
with strong
northwesterly winds
gusting up to
about 50 miles per hour.
We're expecting a high
of around 59 degrees
with the temperature
dropping rapidly
towards the evening.
Showers and thunderstorms
are expected to continue
well into tomorrow.
But by tonight,
we should see a low around 38.
Rain's supposed to be
tapering off
tomorrow afternoon.
- Put that cigarette out.
Hey.
You got a leak.
Hey!
Hey!
Good morning, Wendell.
- Good morning, boss.
- Oswald, Tim, Jennifer.
Any problems other than
the oppression
Oswald is reading about?
- Nein.
- Nine problems?
- No, no.
Tim's taking a class
in German.
- The meat guy just got here.
He's in the kitchen.
- You know,
you should cover your mouth
when you do that.
- I'm tired, man.
- I'll escort you over.
Put that book down
and do your rounds.
I'm not paying you to read.
- Whatever, man.
Give me a break.
- They've still got the heads.
These chickens.
- Hmm.
What?
- Why did they
leave the heads on?
- That's how they do them now.
- Oh, man.
- Hmm.
- Fuck!
Oh, fuck.
Fuck!
- Wendell Stokes,
please report
to the reception desk.
Wendell Stokes,
please report
to the reception desk.
What the fuck is that?
Oh, man.
- Oh!
Hey!
- Silence!
- Hey!
- Silence!
I want you to sit there
and be quiet.
- You!
Go to the end of the line!
Don't sit there.
Find your own seat.
Take one tray from the stack,
one plastic fork and spoon
from the basket.
- Fucking storm!
I could barely see the road,
man.
How was it this morning?
- The storm
wasn't even my problem.
You know they leave the heads
on the chickens now?
And then I came across--
it was like some kind of
animal head
in one of the chopped meat bags.
I don't know what it is.
- At least we know
it's not Ricky retard!
- George?
This head there,
can we maybe use it
to make soup stock?
- You say that about
every disgusting thing we find!
"Hey, George, can we use
intestines for soup stock?
How about these brains,
can we use them for soup stock?"
Rotting meat!
both: Soup stock!
- You know what?
I am so glad I don't
live with you two anymore.
- Oh, you don't find our banter
enlightening?
No, man, you know what?
You're probably right, man.
It probably is better for you
to stay at home
with your old lady.
- You know what, Max?
All right, that's enough!
She's nice enough,
considering
the pay I bring home,
the friends I have.
- He means you, retard.
- No, it's you
I'm talking about!
Quit attacking everybody
all the time!
You can't stop!
That's enough!
Fuck!
- That's enough!
Fuck!
That's enough!
Fuck!
That's enough!
- Whoa, man.
- Hey, George,
can you keep it down?
They're nervous.
We'll take this gentleman
someplace else for lunch.
- That's enough!
Fuck!
That's enough!
Fuck!
That's enough!
Fuck!
That's enough!
- I'm sorry, man.
- They should electrocute
guys like that, man,
turn them into fucking charcoal,
you know?
Fucking mess.
- You know, I hope that
if I was on the other side
of the glass,
you'd be a little bit nicer
to me.
- George!
George, man!
George!
George.
George.
Everything cool?
- Uh, yeah.
I'm just tired, man.
I didn't sleep very well.
Man.
All right, come on.
- [sighs]
- Hi.
- Hey, Pete.
- You do a good job.
- Tonight is chicken
scarpariello and pasta with...
eggplant saut√©, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I can do
all that shit, man.
You go take a nap.
- No, man.
- Go, man, go take a nap.
Yeah.
- Give the number a call, okay?
- Keep moving.
- I can't see my feet.
- You don't need
to see anything.
Straight on.
Careful, you two.
Don't make me hit you.
- Don't make me?
Make you.
- Like you need a reason.
- Move back.
Move back.
- George.
George.
- What time is it, man?
- The power went out.
- Mm.
What?
- The lights died,
and then we heard
an explosion outside.
- We've got a backup power
supply.
- Yeah, well, it's not working,
like the automated doors
and every other fucking thing
in this building.
- What, we're locked in?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Jesus Christ.
- What time is it?
- 6:00.
- Did J.B. bring the people in?
- Some of them
are sitting out there
in the fucking dark.
- Ah, great!
Did anybody call
the maintenance people
or the power company?
- J.B.'s trying to figure out
what happened.
He's in the other room.
- What's he doing?
- He's checking the light.
- Guard!
- It's what I thought.
We're fucked.
- Why?
- The filament
is completely fried.
The power surged before it blew.
Wiring's toast.
- Oh,
and we're all out of jelly.
- Just shut up.
Do the bulbs out there
look like this?
- No, it's fluorescents
out there.
No wires.
I have to check these
to be sure.
- Guard!
- Be quiet!
Or it's liquid lunches
all next week for everyone!
- All right, the power company,
don't they have,
like, an emergency team?
- I'll call them
as soon as I can,
but right now we've got to deal
with the inmates.
- There's no light.
There's no water.
- Bobby, shut the fuck up!
- Where are
the other security guys, man?
- Probably stuck on
the other side of the building.
Wendell was taking two guys
back to their rooms.
I need you and Max to help me
get the
others back to their rooms now.
- No way!
- The sooner we lock them
into their rooms, the better!
Shit, they're stuffed with meds.
There is no risk.
- It's not my job
to deal with this shit!
Call the cops.
- It's got nothing to do
with your job,
it's about getting control
of a dangerous situation,
one we're all trapped in!
- I'll help.
- Good.
- Not me, man.
- George, they know you.
They see you through the window.
You're safe.
I'll take the troublemakers.
Come on, George.
- All right, all right,
all right.
- Right, let's go.
Keep them in single file.
George, you walk at the front.
William, you walk at the back.
As you go, read out the names
written on the open doors.
They'll walk into their rooms.
You lock them in
as you walk past.
If you still
have someone with you
at the end of the hall,
tell him you're gonna bring him
back to me for disciplining.
Here.
The round one
gets you out of the cafeteria.
The square one
opens the door to hall B.
You'll be fine.
Fuck that!
- Everyone, listen.
The lights will be back on soon.
I promise.
- What are the cooks doing?
- These gentlemen
are going to help me
take you back to your rooms.
They're both fully authorized
to discipline anyone
who acts out of line.
You'll eat
and receive your meds privately.
- Who authorized them?
You?
- They can't do that like that!
They're supposed to do
some kind of special training!
If he touches me, I'll scream!
- Shut up and sit down!
I'll take you myself.
Everyone in hall B,
get in line by the door.
George and William
will escort you to your rooms.
George.
- It's time.
- Be quiet.
- It locks by itself.
Is this your first time
in the nuthouse?
Is it?
- No.
- It's his first time
on inside--
- Stop it!
Now!
What's your name?
What's your name?
- James Harper.
- Okay.
You got him?
- I got him.
- Come here, man.
- I've got him.
- Hey, can you stand?
Okay.
- When do you guys think
the power is coming back on?
- Do you think J.B. and Wendell
have the situation
under control?
- I couldn't say.
- Shouldn't we check,
just in case?
- Wait till the lights
come back on.
Why is it that the white guard
is the only one with a Taser?
- It's only fair.
You and Wendell
have a cloaking advantage
in this situation.
- Kiss my ass, cracker!
You better fucking
watch yourself right about now.
- I'm ready for you,
Herr Schwarz.
- Now!
- Bob Kissler.
Martin Howden.
Arthur West.
James Harper.
This is you.
Steven Gordon.
Oh, man.
- Hey.
Someone just got out.
- Hey man, what's going on?
- Whoa!
Oh, fuck!
- Are you okay, buddy?
- What the hell
is this guy doing, man?
- Hey!
Hey!
I want you in your room, okay,
now.
Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.
God, what are these guys on,
man?
- Whatever it is,
he don't need them now.
Come on.
- Let's get this guy back.
- Oh, God.
Oh, man.
Am I bleeding?
- No, it's just red.
How'd he get out?
- I have no idea.
- From now on, that bitch can
eat his own shit for all I care.
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here.
Come on, man!
Come on!
Shit.
- Oh, God.
Where's J.B.?
- I don't know.
- Let's get our knives.
Fuck.
Hey, Cutter.
- Hey, chef.
Do you like my cooking?
- Door.
- Yeah.
- Table.
- Yeah.
Let's see those bastards
open that.
- Yeah.
- The pantry.
Max?
Max, is that you?
Ricky?
Oh, George, fuck!
God.
You scared the shit out of me,
man!
What took you so god damn long,
huh?
Oh, man, you know,
Ricky's gone crazy, man.
- What?
- He's gone crazy.
Fuck!
- Hey, Ricky?
- I'm not leaving here, man.
Fuck that.
- What?
- Where's J.B.?
- I don't know, man.
- We have to call the cops.
- We haven't got a phone.
Come on.
The kitchen's locked, okay?
No inmate can get in here.
Nothing's gonna happen to us.
- What do you know?
Do you know this building?
No, you don't know
a fucking thing!
- Ricky, it's logical.
Okay, no inmate can get in here.
- And it's logical
what's happening here,
no security, nothing?
- Come on, man.
It's gonna be okay.
All right.
Come out when you're ready,
okay?
- Fuck.
- Where's J.B.?
- I don't know, man.
- Oh, shit.
There's a bunch of guys
out there.
- Fuck.
- Fuck.
Do you think they saw us?
- Ricky.
- Shit. Shit. Shit.
- Ricky!
I can't see a fucking thing.
Fuck this shit!
Come on.
Max.
- Max, come on!
- They can't break that window,
right?
- Fuck.
Oh, God.
- Free food, boys, free food.
- Shit.
Oh, shit.
- Come on.
Oh, fuck!
Fuck.
- Don't look at him!
- Is that J.B.?
- Max, don't look at him!
- Come on, guys.
Fuck.
Oh, come on.
Hey.
Hey, look.
- Is that their meds?
- Harry Green, I saw him.
- What?
- Come on.
- He made another inmate
spit out this stuff.
- Are you sure?
- I don't know.
For fuck's sake,
I couldn't see very well.
- What are you whispering for?
This is fucking ridiculous!
We have a flashlight on.
They can see us.
- What do you suggest,
we just grope around
in the dark?
We can't stay here.
Come on, let's go!
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking if it's working.
- There's no fucking power, man!
- Switch off the flashlight,
man, we stick out.
- Come on.
- Come on!
- No, no, no.
Shit, no!
- What are we gonna do
about Ricky?
- What do you want us to do?
Okay, all right.
Look.
Right, let's suppose
nobody ever called the cops.
- Okay, so--
So where are the phones?
- One's in J.B.'s office,
I think.
There might be another
in the receiving room.
- So we have to go
to J.B.'s office?
- Yeah, we need to get his keys.
You-- you guys want to try
to get them?
- Have we got a choice?
- I don't know.
Hey.
- What?
Man?
What?
- You're right, it's nothing.
Come on.
- Hey.
Could you help me?
I'm collecting coupons.
- Coupons?
- Yeah,
in case I get out of here.
I ain't got much savings left,
so--
- We'll come back, man.
- Cool.
If you guys got papers,
just bring them in.
- Lock it.
- Shh. Quiet!
- It locks from the outside.
- The patients, they're kept on
the fucking sedatives.
Normally they're like zombies.
- This is zombies on speed.
- Yeah, exactly.
- What do you mean by that?
- Well, they didn't all
get the same idea
at the same time.
Maybe somebody suggested
they spit out the stuff.
- Harry Green?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I saw him.
- Man, just drop it!
These guys are on a joy ride.
- Look,
I saw that son of a bitch
make another inmate
spit out his meds!
- So, what, you want to go
and get him?
- We should get out of here.
Let's go before they're finished
with whatever the hell
they're doing.
- When are we gonna get to eat?
- Uh, pretty soon, okay?
- How much time?
- 15 minutes.
- Hey, what's so funny?
- It's his first time
on this side.
- Why the hell
would they want his body?
- I don't know.
- Fuck, man.
- We should try
to get into his office, anyway.
Come on.
- Come on, man.
- Fuck.
- What?
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, J.B.'s office
is at the end of the hall,
but this is usually locked.
So they have the keychain.
- Oh, God.
- Okay,
there's someone in the office.
It looks like one of the nurses.
Hey, I don't recognize him.
Okay.
- Uh-uh.
- Have you called the police?
- I'll call back.
- They killed J.B.
It's complete chaos out there!
Did you--
All right.
Did you call the cops?
About the power being out.
You didn't call them
to come and fix it?
- Why?
- Because we're locked
in an asylum
with the criminally insane!
- Don't yell at me.
- All right, okay.
All right,
let me call, okay?
- Fuck you!
smack!
- Oh, fuck!
- Gotcha!
- Fuck.
- Nutjob!
Fucking!
- Hey!
It's okay.
He's down.
Come on.
You get the phone, man.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Hey, Max,
See if this guy's
got the keys on him
so we can lock the door.
- Oh, come on.
Come on.
Yes.
Okay.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm calling from
the Sans Asylum.
My name is George Marshall.
I--
Sans Asylum.
Yeah, listen, okay?
The power blacked out,
and the inmates are rioting.
They killed
at least one security man,
and the others are--
No, the locks are automated.
That's--
Yeah, we tried!
My-- my coworkers and me, yeah.
I don't--
I don't give a fuck!
All right,
there's a decapitated guy
in the corridor,
for fuck's sake!
They took his head off!
Police, fire, rescue,
your janitor if you want!
Just send someone quickly!
You can't get here any faster?
Well, fine!
- Well?
How long till they get here?
- Um...
It's like an hour...
at least.
- Great.
- Max?
- No, I'm fine.
- George.
- Hmm?
- Do you really think
Harry Green's behind all this?
- I don't know.
- Bullshit!
Harry Green is just one of them.
What,
you think he's their leader?
- Come on, there must be
a reason for all this.
- You think they need a reason?
We're in an asylum;
they're inmates.
That's your reason.
- Hey, Max.
I'm sorry.
I should have never
offered you the job.
- I'm sorry I ever took it, man.
If I get out of here,
I'm gonna stick to my guitar.
I'm gonna stick to my music
and never stop.
- Yeah.
You're right.
We should finish the album, man.
- Oh, come on, man,
let's cut the bullshit.
You know,
you'll go back to Lynn.
You'll go back to your chick.
That's what you'll do.
That's your thing.
I'd rather busk in a subway
than waste my life just--
Whatever, man.
- Oh, pick up, come on.
Lynn?
Hey.
It's me.
Yeah, at work.
Is the power out with you?
Yeah, it's out here too.
No, no, no, don't worry.
We're safe.
I just wanted to call, you know,
and see if you were okay.
We're fine.
Yeah.
All right.
I'll see you later, okay?
Yeah, hey.
I love you.
Hmm.
Bye.
- No!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Help!
No!
No!
Help!
Help!
- It's Ricky.
- Stop!
- No!
- What do you want?
What do you want?
Stop!
- No!
- Stop!
Do you want to
get out of here?
Stop it!
- Don't!
Stop!
- Ricky!
Ricky!
Ricky!
- Is he alive?
- I think he's--
- Let me look.
let me look, man!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
- George.
George!
Get me your towel.
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Turn him on his side
so he doesn't choke.
- Let's go.
- Oh, God!
Come on.
- I've got him.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Go, go, go.
- George,
what the hell are you doing?
- Help me!
Help me break this door down!
- George,
what the hell are you doing?
George!
George!
- Get him!
Get the cook!
- Motherfucker!
- Man, I see one of the cooks,
man.
The cops will be here
any minute, man.
You're dead, asshole.
I know it's you, Harry Green.
I know it's you.
No!
Max.
Max.
Max.
Max, wake up, man!
Max!
Max!
Max, wake up now!
Max.
Hey, stop.
Max.
Max, wake up!
Max.
Wake up, man!
Stop it!
- Max, get up!
Stop, man, stop!
Stop it!
- Oops, wrong one.
- Max!
No!
No, Max!
Max!
Max!
Pete, Pete,
what are you doing, man?
Pete?
Huh?
Pete, what are you doing?
Fuck.
Pete, come on, man.
No.
No!
Pete.
Pete, come on.
- Hold still!
- Pete, come on.
No.
No.
Pete.
Pete, look at me.
Why are you doing this?
Don't do this, man.
Why are you doing this?
What is he gonna do to me?
It's Green, right?
Max and Ricky are dead!
Come on!
And so is--

And they were always
nice to you.
Huh?
And so was l.
- I know.
- Well, help me.
Huh?
Please, just help me.
I know it's Green
making you do this.
Just help me, Pete.
- Okay?
- Here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Pete, I want you
to find Harry Green.
Will you do that?
Will you go and find Harry Green
for me?
Thanks.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Okay.
- Oh, he's loose.
Hey, son!
- Fuck all of you!
Smells of gas.
Why?
Why?
We're all gonna die.
Harry, you could save us.
Just...
Turn it off.
Oh, God.
Hey.
Hey.
Come back.
Come back.
Come back!
You motherfucker, come back now!

- Now!
- That's him!
George.
George.
Come on, man.
Come on, George.
Come on, we'll get him out.
Get him in some fresh air, now!
Okay.
Okay, George?
- Are you George Marshall?
- No, I don't remember George.
- Come on, George.
We better get out of here.
- Harry Green.
- Come on.
- Max, Max, my friend--
my friend Max,
he's still in there.
- Lie down for your own safety.
- Hey, rock star,
how are you?
How you doing?
You okay?
You okay, honey?
How are you feeling?
Feel better today?
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna help you.
I love you so much.
What happened to you
was an accident.
It could have just happened
to anyone.
It's not your fault.
Not your fault at all.
I'm so sorry
I couldn't be there.
Everything's gonna be fine.
- What are you doing now?
- I'd like to season it tonight
so the flavor
will soak in better.
- Just leave it for the morning.
- When I do something,
I do it well.
- To season a steak here,
it's...
meaningless.
- Everything has meaning, Max.
All right.
Keep working.
A thin dice, huh?
- Yeah?
- Ooh.
- Aah.
- Stop, man.
Guys.
They-- they got in.
They're inside.
