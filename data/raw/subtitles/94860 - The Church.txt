The Church
They're here.
Hurry!
This way.
Come.
Come.
They're here.
She's one of them.
Who are you?
Where are the others?
Careful!
She's a witch.
Don't let her speak to you.
Don't let her touch you.
She's one of them.
She's a heretic.
They brought the infection.
They have a cross under their
feet to trample on it.
It was written in the prophecies
that they would come...
and would spread out like
a flooded river.
You won't hurt me,
will you?
Look, the stigmata.
The mark of the Devil.
Kill them!
All of them!
Leave nobody alive.
Look.
Look down there.
Look, the dead
are waking up.
They're coming back to life!
Cover them, hurry!
Et Demonium Padreternum
What should we do now?
The men are scared.
Bless this place
and build a church upon it.
May its eternal weight
seal the Devil inside.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- It could've been worse.
It's my first clay
here and I'm late.
A truly idyllic fresco.
Where's the library?
Thanks.
- How about a coffee later?
- Sure.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Who are you? You're not a priest.
- I'm the new librarian.
And I have to catalogue all
these books, unfortunately.
- My name's Evald.
- My name's Lotte.
I'm the churchwarden's daughter,
unfortunately.
Come closer.
Close your eyes.
- Did you hear the horse?
- What? What horse?
Good morning.
It's your first day and you're
already half an hour late.
- It isn't a good start.
- You must forgive me.
- I assure you it won't happen again.
- We agreed you'd be here at 8:30.
Ancl Lotte, there's no reason
why you should be in the library.
I won't be late again,
I promise.
From the Gospel according
to Saint Luke, chapter 8.
From verse 27 onwards.
As Jesus stepped ashore,
he was met
by a demon-possessed
man from the town.
This man had not worn clothes
or lived in a house,
but had lived in the tombs.
When he saw Jesus, he cried out
and fell at his feet, shouting...
"What do you want with me,
Jesus, Son of the Most High God?"
"I beg you,
don't torture me!"
And Jesus asked him,
"What is your name?"
"Legion," he replied, because
many demons had gone into him.
As you've heard, that man
was possessed by the Devil.
The Devil.
Man's sworn enemy that must
be defeated by any means.
The cancer of your conscience
that must be won over with faith.
With absolute faith in the
Lord our Father.
Your absolute dedication
to good causes.
Through prayer, so you won't
fall victim as well.
As happened to that man...
Who implored Jesus to free him
from that Satanic possession.
Stop!
Stop!
- Everything's shaking.
- I told you.
We've got to stop.
Don't touch anything.
From the sound of the drill
it seems empty under there.
Right, I'll have to do a report.
This isn't a simple
restoration anymore.
You have to stop work,
straight away.
There you are.
Weren't we supposed to have
a coffee together?
We've got problems.
Look at those cracks.
This isn't your job anymore, you'll
have to inform the Heritage Ministry.
You're right.
Okay.
Leave everything as it is.
I'll do a survey later.
Let's go, I'm starting to have visions
cataloguing all those books.
Terrifying visions, no doubt.
Martyrs, torture, punishment...
Why not angels, heaven,
virgins, ecstasy?
Evald.
Look what I found.
A parchment.
It's beautiful.
- Where did you find it?
- Down in the crypt.
I'd like to try
and decipher it.
- We must tell the Bishop.
- No, wait.
I want to have
a look at it.
I've never seen
anything like it.
- Okay, I'll take you home.
- Thanks very much.
Good evening.
What did she want?
Nothing, she was just
looking for a ride.
I tried to examine
that parchment.
There's something written on it
but it isn't writing...
It looks more like a code.
I can't decipher it.
Where are you taking me?
What are we doing?
If it served some purpose I'd
spend all night studying it...
- You took it with you.
- We're the only ones who know.
I think I recognised the emblem
of the Knights Templar.
Who were they?
A religious order?
Yes, an order of warrior monks who
defended pilgrims during the Crusades.
They spread out
across half of Europe.
With a cruelty that's remained
legendary.
You know, when they
laid siege to a city...
they would surround
it with hanged corpses.
Just to scare them.
They were very popular
with the Nazis.
Hitler took his inspiration from
them when he created the S.S.
The Iron Cross, which was his
preferred decoration...
was the black cross of the
Knights Templar.
Lord bless this food
and bless us who sit at your table.
Amen.
Reverend, I found that
quote for your sermon.
"Mundus est diavoli."
"Genitivi casus et diavoli
nominativi casus."
The world belongs to the Devil.
The world
is the Devil.
In other words, the world
identifies itself with the Devil.
Won't that be
a bit too much?
Why?
No Devil, no God.
We even meet the Devil in church,
when they put flowers on the altar.
Isn't that right, Reverend?
Sorry I'm late.
I'd be grateful if you would
arrive on time, Father Koss.
Sorry, Father.
You wouldn't happen to have a
Latin quote for my sermon?
You know very well
I haven't studied Latin.
Your plums,
Reverend.
We've arrived.
Do you like it?
Not bad.
Do you live alone?
I'm going to have a shower.
Pour yourself a drink.
Have you ever heard of
the French writer Fulcanelli?
According to him...
the Tables of Law were buried
under one of these gothic cathedrals.
Tables that were once
kept in the Ark.
Which one?
The one from Indiana Jones?
I'm not joking.
There's proof.
That's when the first huge gothic
cathedrals sprang up all over Europe.
There's no other explanation of where
they got the knowledge to build them.
Isn't that fascinating?
Do you realise what could be
hidden under these cathedrals?
Things stolen from the Holy Land.
Treasures.
Or maybe the key to an unknown
science we've lost all trace of.
Something that could turn
the finder into a superman.
A god.
And maybe the key is in
that parchment.
- It seems a bit dishonest to me.
- I don't care.
I don't want to spend my entire
life dusting down old books.
Look at the state of my hands.
It won't come off.
There is a place where
there is hidden...
There are seven
eyes on the stone.
I've got to look for a stone
with seven eyes.
You know this is the only cathedral
that doesn't have a king buried in it.
Or even a bishop.
Why?
There's only one tomb,
that of the builder.
Perhaps they didn't want
anyone digging underneath.
What if I told someone?
No, you won't do that.
You're on my side, right?
Where have you been?
Your bed's still made.
- You went out.
- No, daddy, I went down to pray.
Dressed like that?
You don't fool me, liar!
You've been drinking
and smoking.
No, you went out.
How? The door's locked.
How did you get out?
Come to bed.
I know it's late
but stay here with me.
- Keep me company.
- Forget that and come back with me.
Are you kidding?
Take it, but...
But promise me
you'll read it.
Okay-
I'm gOing-
Be careful.
- Wait until they've locked up.
- Okay.
That which is entrusted to you...
you must keep safe.
There's no stone
with seven eyes.
God.
What's happening to me?
What did I see?
Lotte.
Lotte.
Come out.
I know you're here.
Lotte
Come out.
I heard you.
Lotte
Gothic cathedrals are part of
a cosmic design that we ignore.
Ignorabimus
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Who is it?
Who's speaking?
Hello?
Who is it?
Operator, go ahead.
Hello, police?
Pofice?
4th District, go ahead.
Please hurry!
Yes madam, please tell me..
Help me!
It's trying to kill me!
Please hurry!
Are you crazy?
Hurry, what are
you waiting for?
Calm down.
Call an ambulance.
It's over.
Luckily they traced your call
and we were in the area.
It was a monster.
It wasn't human!
It was a monster!
Hold it, just like that.
Smile.
Smile.
No...
We've got to
finish in an hour.
Go and call the
princess, quick.
It's your turn, princess.
- Would you marry me?
- I'd do more than that!
Evald.
L- li-
You've arrived.
How come you're late?
Oh Evald!
You won't believe it
but something horrible happened to me.
Someone tried to
kill me last night.
Kill you?
It was a monster.
Perhaps it was someone
wearing a mask.
I don't think so.
It was a monster.
A real monster.
I was looking for you.
What did you do?
- What happened to you?
- There isn't much to tell.
That idiot churchwarden
arrived almost immediately.
He flew into a rage and...
I just hope he didn't
recognise me in the dark.
Darling, won't you give me a kiss?
No, please,
we'd better not.
No.
You're hurting me!
Are you crazy?
Idiot!
What's up with her?
Who knows?
A panic attack.
Women.
You can never
tell with women.
Miss Bruckner, I read that the
builders of gothic cathedrals...
built them in such a way
that they would collapse...
if you pressed a precise point
that they kept secret.
If there's a point like that here,
Otto's sure to press it
he's so clumsy.
What are you
talking about, Otto?
So much has been written
about gothic cathedrals.
You drag me to church
and I'm worried about the bike.
If the mechanic doesn't give it
tonight, we'll miss the concert.
Tell me the truth, are you scared
you'll miss the concert, or Frank?
Not again.
And now, kids, we're going
to see the architect's tomb.
Stay close to me.
I'm here with you now, and I'm going
to the concert with you, not Frank.
Will you stop
hassling me about Frank?
I've had enough of
your damned jealousy.
But you called him earlier
at the mechanic's, I heard you.
You didn't go to the toilet.
I can't hear a thing.
These damned things never work.
It's you who's
completely deaf.
Don't make me nervous.
It's our wedding anniversary.
Lotte.
Lotte
Yes?
Would you mind opening
the window, please.
Yes, sure.
What is it?
There's no need to be afraid.
I don't want to hurt you.
You didn't go to school today.
How come?
I didn't feel well.
You had a tummy ache, I bet.
Is that right, Lotte?
- No, I had a headache.
- You're lying.
You mustn't tell lies.
Let's open your tummy,
then we'll see.
Why it hurts.
Shall we open it?
Daddy, please help me!
He's crazy, he wanted to kill me!
Are you listening to me?
- Who?
- Evald, the librarian.
Evald?
Evald is a good man.
It's not true, I'm telling you
he wanted to kill me, he's a monster!
What are you saying?
Don't say that.
You mustn't say that.
No, daddy, let go!
You're hurting me!
Let go of me! No daddy!
What are you doing?
Don't keep me waiting
for those onions.
Not another word.
Clean your mouth.
Lotte.
Lotte
- Where's she going?
- You idiot!
- Did she hurt you?
- She dirtied the dress.
Let's hurry this up,
I've got a flight in three hours.
If they say anything
I'll give them a big smile.
Father, we wanted your permission
to take some photos.
- It's so beautiful here.
- Did you get married today?
Yes, and it would mean a lot
to take...
I'm sorry but I really have to go.
Go ahead
but make it quick.
Easy with the flash.
Come on, let's
be quick!
Hurry up!
May the Lord enlighten you
and help you make a good confession.
I think... Ehm...
Help me.
I need help.
I'm scared.
I've always shunned evil.
That's why I lock myself away
in here with my family.
I know you.
You're Herman, right?
No, I'm not Herman anymore.
I'm not the churchwarden anymore.
Last night the Angel of Evil
entered into me, and I accepted it.
I want to do evil things.
To kill and destroy!
- He scratched me.
- It's nothing.
Kids, don't wander.
Stay close.
Heinrich
Heinrich, did you see that man?
He looked possessed.
- Look at what he did to me.
- It's nothing, you can't even see it.
Poor thing, now mummy will give you a
kiss and you'll feel better, happy?
No!
Out of the
way, kids.
Look up.
Look over here!
A nice smile now.
A bit to the
right, yes.
It's stuck.
Father, Herman
killed himself.
The churchwarden
is dead.
The secret of the cathedral was
destined to remain buried in oblivion.
In the oblivion of millennia.
If it has come
before your eyes...
You poor unfortunate souls.
It's a sign that the terrible
hour has come again.
The evil has taken on the
form of monstrous beings.
That we have called
Demons.
What else is
written there?
Cut it!
Tear it!
There's no other way out.
I'm responsible
for these children.
Try to be strong, dear.
Let's wait before we ruin it.
It costs a lot of money
and we have to give it back.
I can't breathe.
I said wait.
Why don't you open this damned door?
What are you waiting for?
I told you, there's
nothing I can do.
It's the only door.
Then tell me what I
have to do, Father.
It says in the book that since
medieval times...
the original mono portal structure
has remained unaltered.
Did you hear that, idiot?
Are you happy, idiot?
Now we're together.
Reverend.
- There's no time to lose.
- What's going on?
I don't know, but we've got to
get these people out of here.
- You call the police.
- Wait, let's tell the Bishop first.
He already knows.
Call the police immediately.
Will you stop
ordering me around?
- Listen...
- Why don't you call someone?
- The fire brigade, for example.
- The churchwarden's dead.
There's blood everywhere
in the crypt, now call the police.
Or the Boy Scouts.
Who do you call in these situations?
Reverend
Reverend, wait.
- Have you found a way out?
- We're doing everything we can.
I'm responsible for these children.
Their parents will be worried.
I can't do it.
It won't budge.
How can they build a church
with only one door?
Darling, have a biscuit.
Don't get upset.
Will you stop talking
and get me out of here?
Just a bit longer, please.
Excuse me, do you have a
sharpener or a pair of scissors?
- Will this do?
- Thank you.
Heinrich
I've had an idea.
What's wrong?
Depositum custodi.
In the name of God,
what's going on?
I'm cold.
I'll get you
some water.
Miss Bruckner, it's past midnight.
My parents will be worried.
My glasses!
Otto?
Otto, where are you?
Help me.
- Please help me.
- Leave it to me.
Where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere for you.
And don't look at
me like an idiot.
We've got to find
a way out of here.
Then what are
you waiting for?
I found your glasses.
Thank you Otto
You're a
very good boy.
Come on, Fisher,
it's nothing.
- Pull yourself together.
- It's like he infected me.
Come on, those
things don't happen.
Go away!
Leave me alone!
- I never want to see you again.
- Okay, I'm going.
No!
Wait.
Do you remember Nietzsche,
the philosopher we studied?
He said, to know
your best friend
you must see his
face when he sleeps.
Yes, because if he's your best friend
he'll have the same face as you.
I'm your best friend and I feel
like I'm going to fall asleep.
Do you really
want to see me?
It's a stupid idea.
There isn't even a rope.
Then we'll climb up to the top.
Help me.
If we can ring the bell
they'll hear us.
It won't work.
Anyway nothing works with you.
We won't make it.
We're too old.
How great to
be immortal
like the
possessed...
Yeah... Yeah...
Go ahead
Come on
What do we do now?
It's so heavy.
- Help me.
- Yes, I'll ring it with my head.
It was your idea.
Deal with it.
I might have
another idea.
I have to go home right now.
Please take me.
You're crazy.
I'm staying here.
You're an idiot,
I hate you!
Go away.
I want to be alone.
What's happening?
In the name of God,
what's happening?
What's happening
is in Satan's name.
The cathedral is
infested with evil.
But how?
In a church?
Precisely, a church is the Devil's
most hated place.
And the door?
Who closed the door?
- The Devil?
- No.
There's a safety mechanism
built into the cathedral.
Safety?
- Who for?
- For the outside world.
The evil contagion is like the plague.
Worse than the black death.
How come you
know all of this?
It's written on this parchment.
It's all here.
It isn't the first
time it's happened.
- Then what do we have to do?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
- There's no choice.
Be possessed or die under the
ruins of the cathedral.
Ruins?
What ruins?
There's a secret point
in the cathedral.
You just need to touch it and the
entire structure will collapse.
With help from the parchment
I now know this point.
But the secret will always remain
locked in the mouth of its builder.
If the cathedral collapses
the sacrifice of the few
will save the majority.
And its stones
will bury the evil.
But if I don't do anything
the evil will spread like the plague.
And this corrupt city will
have its just punishment.
It will be a
second judgment clay!
Now you talk like God.
Give me that parchment.
- I am the church!
- You're out of your mind!
Give me that parchment!
Don't touch me!
You can't play God!
God!
What do I have to do?
Tell me what
I have to do!
Please, tell me!
It's a dead end.
There's no way out!
Where have you taken me?
Get me out of here!
Shut up.
Did you hear that?
Do something!
Wait.
Listen.
What?
Don't you hear it?
Shine the torch.
Don't let me go!
Please don't let go!
Don't let go! Don't let go!
Help me, please!
I can't do it!
Go on! Go on!
Where has everyone gone?
Where are the priests?
I must find Evald.
Evald?
Don't leave me
alone, please.
Don't you go as well.
What I'd give for a mirror.
I can't live without a mirror.
I need it.
That's not me.
I'm beautiful!
I'm so beautiful!
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
It's me.
Father Koss.
Father Koss!
Don't you recognise me?
Where have you been?
I saw you leave today.
How did you get back in?
Is there a way out
that we don't know?
I saw them.
- Will you listen to me?
- I saw them.
My father was there
and my mother.
How did you get back in?
You must tell me.
There's an opening.
A hole.
In the crypt, behind the fountain.
No one else knows about it.
Lotte
We've got to
get out of here.
Now.
Are you listening to me?
They killed everyone,
even the animals.
Nobody knew why
They said they
carried disease.
They didn't even let
the architect live.
He knew and that
frightened them.
He was arrested
and put on trial.
I followed your orders
I constructed the mechanisms
to destroy the cathedral.
Even a thousand years from now
if the contagion should reappear.
That pestilence,
as you rightly call it.
You are an alchemist
and alchemy is an inhuman science.
You serve the Devil.
Everything you don't understand
you call alchemy.
Ascribing the plague to an
invasion by the Devil.
Mistaking illness for evil,
but it's all lies.
Lies generated by your
sick tormented minds.
The secret of this cathedral
must never be revealed.
And it will remain locked
in your mouth forever!
They buried him here.
The monks threatened anyone who
dared put another tomb in the church.
- Why do you know these things?
- I don't know, I was there.
I don't know.
The secret will remain locked
in your mouth forever.
Let's go.
Come with me.
- What are you waiting for?
- You'll have to go alone.
No, please
come with me!
I have to stay here.
Save yourself!
I'll join you later.
Go!
The secret of the cathedral was
destined to remain buried in oblivion.
The evil has taken on the form
of monstrous beings.
That we have called...
demons.
In the mouth.
It must be in the mouth.
And this makes Fulcanelli's
theow more plausible...
That gothic cathedrals are part of a
cosmic design that's unknown to us.
Tied to the ancient alchemy
of their builders.
And so, inexplicably, with a crash,
the cathedral collapsed.
Burying numerous victims under
the ruins, one stormy night.
Miraculously intact,
but unstable...
The bell tower seems to represent
a constant threat to the city.
So much so that they're thinking of
transferring the ruins to a museum.
Did you see that?
