If you knew that there is only
one person in the world ...
Who is able to make you happy.
And he is the right one for you.
What would you sacrifice
to find him?
How many centuries would you
spend looking for him?
And if you finally found him ...
Would you ever let him go again?
Wouldn't you hold him with both
arms as tightly as you can?
And never, never,
never let him go again?
- Why are we even flying to Paris?
- You shouldn't have killed the pilot.
- Charlotte?
- Two more pages, I want to know the end.
Now!
- How unfortunate.
- What?
You can't help it.
Let me guess:
Her eyes were too good to be true?
Do not listen to her Louise.
Sooner or later you'll be lucky.
Sooner or later ...
- Be careful!
- Stop! Stop!
Down on the ground!
Come on, down! Hands behind your head!
Legs apart!
Stand still!
Go away, let me through!
Police!
Ah fuck!
Excuse me! Hi. Did you see
a guy run past?
- This tall, hooded sweatshirt and dark pants.
- Sorry.
- Found anything?
- Nothing, no trace.
That's impossible!
May I sit with you?
I have to rest for a while.
That bastard was too fast for me.
- What has he done?
- Who?
The bastard who was
too fast for you.
He robbed a Russian pimp
we were about to arrest.
I bet the idiot didn't know whom he was robbing.
He made us miss our oportunity.
Tom.
- Hi.
- Doesn't this hurt?
It's OK. You have to be careful,
There is broken glass everywhere.
Thanks for the warning!
Too late, unfortunately.
- And what do we do now?
- Now I have to arrest you.
- If you get me.
- If I get you?
I already got away once.
- I didn't know who i was chasing.
- And I now know who I'm running from.
- That will make you faster?
- Funny cop!
We could ...
Stay here!
Come on, stop it.
I don't want to hurt you.
Sorry, Tom.
Insufficient funds in your account.
Shit!
Hi, Honey. You didn't mention that
your probation officer was so cute.
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Yes, of course.
- Hey, are you crazy? Do you have a problem?
- Shut up, asshole!
Let her through!
I'm dying of thirst!
Can I buy you a drink?
Not yet!
Not yet, you can keep it.
Consider them an advance for letting
me stare your beautiful eyes.
Where are your friends?
What friends?
At your age no one goes out
without friends.
I've made my decision for a solo career.
If you don't want to be like the others,
you have two options:
You let their world destroy you ...
Or you create your own world.
It takes money to do that.
Or a good dose of courage.
And you have both.
Enough for two.
I think I will continue alone.
Good luck!
You can't even see it.
It is hidden from your eyes,
although each look reveals it.
- What are you talking about?
- About what is in you.
And what is this?
Something special!
Rare!
Breathtaking.
Well, you are the first person
to notice that.
I am not a person.
A horrible plane crash
occurred last night
The plane crashed in Berlin
ten minutes before landing.
I was so excited that you'd come.
I couldn't sleep!
Come!
- Good evening.
- What have you done to me?
Sit down.
- What have you done to me?
- Calm down.
I know what you're missing.
- What's in it?
- Your new life.
To immortality.
This is nonsense!
You are crazy!
Your new conquest seems
to have trouble accepting it.
You will need to prove it to her!
If you want them to swim ...
throw them into the water.
- You have a girl for me?
- Yes.
- Does she have experience?
- Not yet.
What are you doing to me?
I will teach you something
you don't want to learn.
Do not feel pity.
The more evil the man is,
the sweeter his blood.
She says you're a shy girl.
We'll change this.
I've paid for you!
She learns quickly.
We never get to have fun with pimps.
Wait.
Oh, Louise.
- Please, please, please!
- You already have two red which you never drive.
Let yourself go.
Let go.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What happened here?
- Where are the corpses?
- This way to the stairs.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You've talked to anyone?
- What makes you say that?
- How many bodies do we have?
- Two.
A burned body here and the
second is in the next room.
- The other corpse is also burned?
- Yes.
- Who found them?
- Two teenagers.
Well, look at that.
Am I dead?
You can't defeat your thirst
with abstinence.
Well?
How does it feel?
Yes. I know.
You have no idea about
the miracles awaiting you.
I know how you feel.
I still remember my transformation.
It was a masked ball at court.
It all happened very fast.
At first I hated it.
How could she do this to me?
But then we traveled all over Europe together.
She showed me the world
and opened my eyes.
When she was burned a century
later on the beach in Nice ...
I wanted to follow her.
I was so desperate ...
Lost.
But something held me back.
A desire, A hope.
Then I started  searcing.
And now ...
Now I finally found you.
They can't have tampered with the tapes
in such a short time. It's not possible.
There!
Hey, we have a witness.
I can't believe it. Zoom in.
What's that on his ear?
Wow, cool!
You should have given her
a wedding dress.
Welcome to the family!
You look fantastic.
- Shall we go?
- I have no shoes.
My poor Cinderella.
You'll take yours!
Press!
The one with the fewest bags
is paying!
- Do you have a favorite restaurant, Lena?
- Are we going to eat?
Just for fun.
We eat, drink, snort cocaine and fuck
as much as we want ...
And we don't get fat, pregnant or addictive.
Smile a little.
Billions of women would kill for that.
- You saw that?
- She can smile!
Nora! The waiter is not included on the menu.
- There goes my dessert.
- Enjoy your meal.
This doesn't fill the crave
but it tastes good.
How old are you anyway?
You don't ask that question to a lady.
If Louise hadn't discover me at
the Love Parade, I would be 37!
Hey, young lady.
Smoking is prohibited here.
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?
How many are there like you?
40 women in Europe.
About 100 worldwide.
- And the men?
- They became extinct.
They were too noisy, too greedy ... too stupid.
Some were killed by humans and the rest
we killed them ourselves.
We swore to never pass the gift
to another male.
Long live the liberation!
For over 100 years no
man, mortal or immortal ...
Is telling me what to do.
No king, no leader, no husband.
How many women can say
the same thing?
Excuse me ...
If you try this one more time,
I'll have you fired.
I know, I was a little harsh.
But he is cute, right?
So why are you so rude to him?
- I don't want to hurt him.
- That's what you just did.
I mean, really hurt him.
Humans "break" so easily.
Come!
Charlotte.
Charlotte!
You are so beautiful.
You are so beautiful.
I didn't want to rush things.
I'm sorry.
Stupid Louise.
Stupid, stupid, stupid Louise!
Hey! Good morning.
- Already here?
- Yes.
Did you even go home?
I couldn't sleep.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
- I'm afraid of missing something.
- I'll give you an advice ...
- Find a way to compensate for this shit.
- You mean a hobby?
No, I mean a private life.
Cuddles and kisses.
I'm working on it.
Are you going out?
I spent the last two nights out.
Did you even notice?
You are old enough.
- How did you find me?
- Hi. I almost didn't recognize you.
You have a file in the police computer.
- Are you going to try and arrest me again?
- No.
I'm too afraid of you!
Wait a minute.
You stole money from an asshole
abusing women.
You would serve 18 months
if I arrested you.
It would be unfair.
Here!
- What's in it?
- Open it!
I wanted to wash it but my
washing machine is broken.
I found it on the bridge after you
run away the other day.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
You changed your style didn't you?
I like it.
- It's only a dress.
- No, there's something else.
- You've only seen me once.
- It's my job to be observant.
Your hair, for example, are different now.
They are not dyed. And your shoes ...
You've never wore heels again.
I can tell from the way you walk.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
The first time we met you wouldn't
agree to have a coffee with me.
- Will you leave me alone then?
- But we just met.
Just once.
I promise.
Let me get that.
Here you go.
How's your hand?
- It's healed.
- Not bad.
I have good genes.
- Why would someone like you become a cop?
- Someone like me?
Well, someone who seems all right.
Oh, thanks.
It's one of the few jobs where you get
paid for the adrenaline rush.
Car sirens, breaking through doors,
chasing the criminals. I love it.
- That's what you said to your job interview?
- Exactly. And you?
- Stealing was always your dream job?
- I'm done with that.
I'm glad.
Did I say something wrong?
I must go.
- Really?
- Yes.
Too bad.
- Can I walk you back?
- Sure.
- Everything okay?
- Yes.
- You promised!
- You can tear it once i'm around the corner.
Come on, Lena. Why shouldn't we
meet again? This is ridiculous.
I'll get in trouble with my boyfriend.
How do you think I can afford such clothes?
This is my only way of getting away from here.
You are a horrible liar.
Are you already bored of the nightlife?
Louise would tell you that
you will get used to it.
She wants you to be happy.
I became too depressing for her taste.
She thinks you're the one
she seeks for centuries.
You'd better not disappoint her.
I was a very untalented actress.
I wouldn't survive the transition
to talking movies.
Louise and I met at a movie premiere.
My husband and my daughter
had already returned home.
You looked wonderful.
Otherwise you wouldn't have bitten me?
Or Nora? Or Lena?
- Oh, Charlotte, don't ruin the evening.
- Right, since we're having so much fun.
- The ladies seem to be in a bad mood.
- You don't spoil us enough.
- Which unfulfilled desire torments you?
- I miss the sun.
I feared you wished for something
that I wouldn't be able to give you.
- Where is he?
- In there.
- Who are you? Are you a cop?
- Put the gun down! Slowly!
Let me see.
I want to be in a secure cell.
In the best prison. Please!
How did you get in here?
Hi, guys!
Get out of here!
We will call the police!
- Please don't!
- I won't say this again. Get out.
Why don't you take off your uniforms
and come join us?
- What did she say?
- That we should join them!
There's plenty of room here.
They pay you that good you can
deny yourselves this pleasure?
Look, She's topless!
- This is a huge opportunity!
- I have to agree, unlikely to happen again!
- You won't do anything to them, right?
- I promise.
Ladies.
Hello, Mr. guard!
What's your name?
I'm Bernard.
- What were you doing up there?
- Guarding the place.
- This is fine.
- Really?
Of course ... perfectly normal.
Can you tell me your name?
Guess.
Chantal?
Mandy?
Yvette? Nicole? Steffi?
Isabelle?
Where is my colleague?
He's gone already?
Do you have any idea
where my colleague is?
Nora!
Charlotte! No, Charlotte!
Charlotte!
Stop behaving like this
and accept what you are!
Nora!
- Why did you do that?
- Why not?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
- Oh, please!
- We need an ambulance!
- Yes.
No! No! No!
Hi, this is Tom Serner.
Speak after the tone.
Hello Tom. It's me, Lena.
I ...
I didn't know who to call and I ...
I ...
Oh God!
- They are very dangerous, believe me!
- What kind of drugs are you on?
Who? Me?
I'm not taking drugs.
Why did burn your two partners?
In German please.
I've already told you everything.
I didn't kill them, those women did it.
Their eyes were like the the devil's eyes
and they walked on the ceiling.
- Aha, they had wings?
- What?
I mean, they could fly?
- Why did they steal my Lamborghini?
- What?
My Lamborghini!
- What color is it?
- Silver.
Silver, like the cross.
Where did you find the Lamborghini?
The "Grand Hotel"?
- No, the special forces have to wait!
- Special forces?
Yes, it wasn't my decision.
Hello Tom. It's me, Lena.
I didn't know who to call and I ...
"I ...
What's up?
You have a girlfriend now?
Wake up, my Romeo.
No. No!
What have you done? No!
The police is surrounding the hotel.
I'll hold them.
Have your men at the emergency exits too, understand?
Yes, of course, immediately!
- What floor?
- Fourth.
How did they find us?
Meow!
Take the safe cars.
Don't move!
Charlotte!
Charlotte!
Get in! Charlotte!
- Where's Nora?
- Behind me.
Shit!
- Stop!
- Why?
- Damn!
- We must help her!
Fire.
- Nora.
- You can't help her.
Charlotte, be reasonable.
- Don't leave me!
- Nora!
Go!
Come on, faster!
Don't move.
It's over!
Please, Lena!
Don't hurt him!
- We are approaching the sunlight!
- Get out!
Crazy day, right?
Who was that policeman?
- I've seen you together.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- How does he know you?
- He tried to arrest me for something insignificant.
For something insignificant?
For something insignificant
Nora is burnt!
For something insignificant
we're on the run.
You brought them to us.
That's not true.
I didn't say anything to him!
How did they find us?
You kill people every night!
Do you think this goes unnoticed?
She's right, Louise.
Cleaning up has never been our strong point.
- You are on her side now?
- I'm not on anyone's side.
You should just calm down.
Of course.
Of course.
We need money and new passports.
I have to say goodbye
before we leave town.
It stinks of death here.
When was the last time
Charlotte saw her?
In 1923.
She's sleeping.
Maybe it's better this way.
Mom!
Come on! Come on!
It's time.
Our next sunrise will be in Moscow.
Charlotte!
No! Charlotte!
- No! Charlotte!
- I'm sorry.
Open the door! Don't do this!
Open the door!
Charlotte! Don't do this! No!
No! Don't do this!
Open the door!
Charlotte.
Charlotte.
I wanted to see you again before I left.
Who are you?
I can't explain it to you
with words.
Stay away!
- Let go. Stop it!
- Look carefully!
Let it go!
No!
Shit! Lena!
Look at it Tom.
- I'll call an ambulance!
- Tom! Look at it.
Just shut up.
Lena, no!
Come on, get up!
Go.
I'm sorry I had to do this.
Me too.
Asshole!
Good evening.
How do you imagine your future, Lena?
Even if he stayed with you which I doubt ...
He has 60 more years of life at best.
And then?
Then you will be alone.
Loneliness will devour you slowly,
day after day.
Believe me ...
I know what I'm talking about.
Shut up!
No!
- Lena, run away!
- Louise!
Don't harm him, please!
I'll let him live.
On one condition:
Tell me you love me.
Say it like you mean it.
I love you.
I love you!
I love you, Louise!
I love you!
This is the most beautiful lie
I have ever heard.
No!
No!
Now there are only two of us left.
Headquarters?
I'll start the search.
I'll do it.
Let's take fingerprints.
Good luck!
