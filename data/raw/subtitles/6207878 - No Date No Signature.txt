No Date, No Signature
Are you blind or something?
That jerk hit my side mirror
and I hit you.
Why do you drive
when you can't control the car?
He hit me! Is the kid OK?
Is she OK? Check her head.
It's nothing, dear.
Let me see your arm.
It's nothing.
- Do you have pain?
- My head.
Where? Let me see.
Call the police.
I'm a doctor.
- Do you have nausea?
- Nausea?
- Do you want to throw up?
- No, just it hurts here.
Where?
- How many are these?
- One.
- Call the police. I don't have a mobile.
- OK, let me check him first.
You don't drive like a human!
Pick her up. She's crying.
What are you waiting for?
- Give me your mobile.
- Out of battery.
No need for the police.
I'll pay compensation
and take you to the clinic.
No clinic! Call an officer!
Shall I call a pickup
and take it to a garage?
It's fucking broken down!
It isn't even mine.
Give your car's light.
- Can you fix it?
- How do I know?
- Madam, please sit in the car.
- I'm fine here.
You sit in the car, boy.
- Is that OK?
- Get in, son.
- Tell your wife to get in too.
- No need!
Hello? Azar?
Go to the window.
Can you hear me?
Her husband knows she is there?
She can leave her photos,
but I won't do it.
I'm busy now, Azar.
We'll talk at night. Bye.
- You OK, son?
- Yes.
- What's your name?
- Amir.
Amir!
Roll up your sleeve.
- Your surname?
- Khanroodi.
- You are cold?
- A little.
Fold your arm like this.
- Which grade are you?
- Third next year.
So you've grown up.
- Now do this.
- It stings.
- Your head hurts too?
- A little here.
- Do you want to take a nap?
- No.
What is this?
The A/C, heater,
and the glass steam.
- 5 gears?
- Yes. Put your hand here.
1, come down.
Aren't you strong, champ?
Go up.
3, down.
It hurts?
5, and reverse.
- That's the horn?
- No, this one.
That's the windscreen water.
I'll be back now.
Was it fixed?
Only the shield
and headlight are broken.
- How much they'll cost?
- Dunno.
- Tell me.
- I don't know now.
OK, get in.
I'll take you to a clinic
and pay you for the damage.
- I'll take them.
- I can give you a lift.
Get out!
OK.
Take as much as you want.
- I won't get compensation.
- Take it.
Go to your mother.
Take it.
Thank you.
- You ok with it?
- Yes, no problem.
There is an underpass ahead.
The clinic is next to it.
I know where it is.
Get on.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Won't you shake hands?
Change his position every 2 hours
even if he doesn't show a reflex.
Sure.
The taxi is downstairs. Can I leave?
Wait a second.
- When did you change his catheter last?
- One or two hours ago.
- He had discharge today?
- No.
No need. I have money.
Thank you.
- Sayeh brought the cartons?
- Yes.
They are clothes.
She said she'd arrange them.
What should I tell my sister?
She left her photos.
It isn't complicated.
She'll go to the expert
and they'll determine the compensation.
She wanted you to see them,
because some time has passed.
Didn't I tell you
not to talk about my job?
She isn't a stranger.
All right.
Tell her to come
to the Legal Medicine tomorrow.
- When?
- Morning.
Thank you. May I?
- Close the door tightly.
- Sure.
OK, now!
You enjoy keeping me waiting!
I told them last month I'd be leaving
and handed over the building management.
They nag whenever they see me.
"The lift is not working.
They don't pay the charge!"
- They don't have a new manager?
- They do, but he is a wacko!
A wacko?!
You use another term?
We were more polite.
We'd say he was an ape!
Mannerless!
- There's only bread in it!
- Fasten your seat belt!
Hello, doctor. Right away.
Sayeh, dear? We are there.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.
- A woman wants to see you.
- Tell her to come here.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.
- I didn't want to bother you.
- Take off your glasses.
- When did it happen?
- A week or 10 days ago.
- Why you didn't come back then?
- I pitied him when he cried.
- He was wearing a ring?
- Yes, he was.
- Only your face?
- No, my back too.
The photos are in my mobile.
- You know Forensics in Behest St?
- I'll find it.
- Go to Mr Garoosi and I'll call him.
- You can't do it?
No, examination office is there.
Print your photos too.
They determine compensation
for today or 10 days ago?
10 days ago, I think.
- I bring the result to you?
- No, they'll do it there.
Thank you.
Will you sign it, doctor?
It's from yesterday.
- What is it?
- The youth in the accident.
It's written car accident again.
Dr Moshiri says the cuts were caused
by the windscreen and guardrail.
The cut behind his ears is sharp.
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, sir.
Clean the shards.
- Your hand is OK?
- Yes, sir.
I won't sign it.
Send it to the commission
or give it to Dr Salehi to sign.
- Dr Salehi may not come today.
- Farrokh, I won't sign it.
Have a bite, doctor.
I don't have appetite.
You'll regret it. It's organic!
Don't give him eggs every day!
He's got fatty liver.
- Watch him at home.
- No home for the time being.
- You aren't taking your stuff?
- I am.
- Why there are so many applicants?
- Guess they are from last semester.
They regret coming here
after two days!
What should I do with this?
What's the problem?
His family don't want
a complaint or autopsy.
- Dr Salehi has come?
- Not yet.
- What has the judge ordered?
- Legal action.
Then why are you asking?
Explain the situation to his family.
Yes?
What does he want to see?
Where is he now?
Tell him to run DNA test.
If he is the father, I'll inform them.
That's not a problem.
Goodbye.
- Won't you take it?
- No, my hand's dirty. Farrokh will bring it.
- Have you shuffled them?
- Take them away, kiddy!
- Male, 30, severe burn.
- Immolation?
His family haven't said anything,
but it is probable.
Male, 67...
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You're better?
- Yes, professor.
Go on.
67, pulmonary fibrosis.
Male, 23, brain stroke.
- Farrokh, did you give the file to doctor?
- He sent it to the commission.
- Sign it before there is trouble.
- Why trouble?
He was saying yesterday
you send all his autopsies to the commission.
- He must do his job well.
- You won't let go!
Male, 31, poisoning.
- CO?
- No, aluminium phosphide.
Male, 49, heart problem record.
Hospital confirmed heart failure,
but family claim died in a street fight.
- The CID investigated?
- Not yet.
Amir Khanroodi, 8,
cause of death unknown.
Dead on admission.
Male, 52, death at home.
Who?
- The last?
- No, before that.
Amir Khanroodi, 8,
cause of death unknown.
Dead on admission.
- When they brought him?
- This morning.
- He is in the hall?
- Yes.
You know him?
Maziyar?
Did you see Dr Nariman?
He was in the yard.
- Shall I come with you?
- No!
Farrokh says you got very upset.
It's nothing. I'll be ok.
You knew the kid?
Whose child is he?
The son of an acquaintance.
A close one?
Not close. I knew his father.
What does his file say?
Cause of death unknown
and he'd had severe nausea.
He died at 3 am
on the way to hospital.
- He had a history?
- I don't know.
- Do you want to see his family?
- No.
- They know you work here?
- I don't know, no.
- OK, I'll autopsy him.
- Why?
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing!
Farrokh has the file?
Bring the little boy to autopsy hall.
- I must talk to you.
- Later.
Now!
- Why do you talk like that?
- I'm not your subordinate.
Why you send all my autopsies
to the commission?
- I do that whenever I think it's necessary.
- We are dumb? Only you understand?
Talk properly, fool!
I've told you 100 times
to check everything.
How do you know I didn't?
The family of the deceased
are waiting outside for your report.
- I did a complete autopsy.
- He has knife marks on his ear!
I'll talk to him.
As if only he understands!
- Bring the kid's file.
- I will.
Listen!
What's the matter with you?
- He gets on my nerve.
- I know.
What's the matter with you today?
I said I'd do the autopsy.
- OK, bring his file.
- No need!
I'll give your cases to Dr Salehi.
- I must work!
- Can you work like that?
Listen to me!
- Sayeh, don't insist!
- Just go!
Nothing will happen without you.
I'll call you when the autopsy is over.
Go!
Kaveh! Look at me.
Don't sit here. Go!
- What is it?
- I don't know.
They just yell!
- We are working here.
- The guard can't do anything.
We ask them to close this door
but they won't do it.
Shouting, yelling,
insulting all the time!
- What's going on here?
- Don't let them in.
- Call Dr Behbahani.
- She went out.
- Why?
- To talk to the kid's parents.
- What for?
- I don't know.
- The autopsy was done?
- A long time ago.
She sent the samples
to the lab at noon.
- Why the lab?
- Excuse me.
They are only insulting.
OK, now. Please go in.
Why these questions?
Why should we answer?
What is your job, then?
What have you been doing
to my kid since morning?
Why don't you talk
in a way we understand?
Calm down! I'm doing my job.
I know you are sad.
The test result is out.
Come take it.
Stay here, please.
Why did you come?
I said I'd call.
- I want to know what happened.
- I did the autopsy.
Wrap the child for identification.
- When did you last see the boy?
- I don't remember.
- During the past week?
- I think so.
- No ptosis?
- I don't remember exactly.
His breathing was normal?
No weakness?
He was weak.
- Did he...
- Talk properly, Sayeh! Don't ask!
I'm telling!
- I saw him only for 5 minutes.
- OK!
He's had diarrhoea
and vomiting for a week.
He was weak
and they took him to hospital.
They gave him an IV
and sent him home.
- What does it mean?
- Most probably acute poisoning.
- You sure?
- No, I ran a test.
Why was that man shouting?
That man?! Your friend?
I said I just know him.
Must you tell me something
but you don't?
No. How come?
Nothing!
It is a special case?
No, Dr Nariman knows them.
The parents are here.
Send them in for a test.
They must have it too.
They will have it too
if it is botulism.
The child definitely has it.
They might have had the same food
with different reflexes.
- It is only from food poisoning?
- It is sometimes blood poisoning too.
It is very rare in general.
- Could he be saved?
- I can't tell with certainty.
If it isn't diagnosed,
it will kill in 10 days.
- How many days he had it?
- He was probably in the 6th or 7th day.
Don't you hear that?
Yes?
Hello, sister.
I lost my kid!
I lost him!
I'm wearing black now!
I don't know.
He had diarrhoea
and vomiting for a week.
He shivered, couldn't eat.
He couldn't even moan last night.
I woke up Moosa
to take him to the hospital.
We usually don't tell the family
the cause of death.
We send it to the legal authorities.
But it is a special case.
- Do you have another child?
- Yes.
- You eat the same food?
- What do you mean?
- Does she eat from your food?
- No, her mother breastfeeds her.
- Nobody else lives with you?
- No, why?
He had food poisoning.
It is a poison called botulin.
Excuse me.
- Stay outside.
- No, come in.
I was explaining.
Your son had botulism,
a rare disease.
It's a kind of food poisoning
caused by contaminated food.
You didn't have tuna can
in the past week?
No.
- What about your son?
- He didn't like fish.
Any other tin food?
Stale or rotten meat,
something you don't know its origin?
No.
You must both run a test.
Didn't you feel weak in the past week?
Or difficulty in swallowing?
The symptoms your son had.
What did you mean
by stale meat?
Meat produces poison, botulism,
if it is kept in a closed space.
If it enters the body,
it will cause death in 10 days.
- Moosa!
- Wait!
- Well?
- That's all.
You didn't remember something?
I'm saying that for your sake.
No.
Nothing!
You must both run a test.
If you had any symptom,
come to the doctor quickly.
He is ready now for identification.
The burial permit is issued too.
Accept my condolences!
- I want to sit a moment.
- No problem.
Don't be late
because the ambulance will leave.
- What is she saying, Moosa?
- Don't say anything now.
- She said stale meat.
- Just a minute!
- Moosa...
- Shut up!
How much do you know them?
Who?
The child's parents.
Why don't you let go?
Do I ask you to explain everything?
No.
- His father is hiding something.
- How come?
The wife wanted to say something
but he stopped her.
- You sure?
- I felt it.
Write it in your report
if you think it is important.
- What is it?
- What?
Superficial swelling
at the back of skull.
It was nothing important.
- No bleeding?
- Not at all.
- Fracture?
- No.
Did you ask his family
about the swelling?
No, why? It wasn't necessary.
Thank you.
You're not coming?
No, I have a few files
from yesterday.
OK, bye.
Khanroodi, Amir!
Come here.
Is it him?
Yes.
May he rest in peace!
Don't stand there.
May God grant you patience!
Get the burial permit downstairs.
Hello, Ms Sahragard.
This is Nariman.
Thank you.
I have a question.
You were the prosector
of the autopsy of the child today?
Yes, the 8-year-old one.
Dr Behbahani had had mentioned
a superficial head swelling, right?
The skull didn't have a fracture?
What about bleeding?
Did you check the cervical vertebrae?
No fracture?
I mean, did you open it up?
That can't be a reason.
I know about the poisoning.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Come in.
They're asking about you.
I will.
It is 10.
I don't think they'll leave.
Why they stayed?
To come to the grave tomorrow.
To do what?
What everybody does.
Where were they
when he was alive?
Were you dumb then?
Did you care about us?
Watch your tongue!
Whenever they came, you left.
Leila? Where is the dustbin?
Behind the curtain.
Get something for dinner.
They are hungry.
What the heck!
- They've come for our sake.
- I don't have money.
- Why do you shout?
- I don't! I just don't have money.
There is the rubbish you brought.
Shall I give it to them?
- Being sarcastic, eh?
- I shouldn't be?
- By God I didn't...
- Why you brought it if you didn't?
- Quiet! They'll hear you.
- I shut up? Shame on you!
- The fucker said it was ok.
- Why did he sell it cheap then?
- By God I didn't know.
- I hate you more when you swear.
Leila?
Leila?
Why are you sitting here?
You saw him?
Saw who?
Amir.
Yes.
Why you didn't let them
open his face in the grave?
Let's go in.
Come on.
I won't! You go.
I'll leave
after his 7th Day Anniversary.
Where will you go?
Dunno.
I may return to Garmsar.
I'll take Raheleh with me.
Why are you talking nonsense?
It isn't your call.
It is!
I don't want to stay here.
I didn't say anything
and you got cheeky.
You want to beat me?
Go ahead!
Fool! I said I didn't know!
- Know what?
- By God I didn't!
You thought they pitied you?
They'll hear you!
Didn't you think why it was cheap?
He only said
they hadn't been slaughtered.
Why not?
Why not if they were good?
Shh!
You thought they give you
healthy chicken so cheap?
- You!
- What? I'm stupid?
You took my child from me.
Quiet!
They'll hear you.
Let them hear!
You think nobody understands?
Listen to me.
Are you a man?
Do you care?
Look at me.
Look at me!
I don't want to!
Why don't you understand
I can't see you?
You killed my son!
My Amir!
Oh God!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Why don't you go?
I will.
Something wrong?
When you autopsied yesterday,
you didn't see any sign of
cervical vertebrae movement?
You asked Sahragard.
Why do you ask me again?
- I'm really sorry.
- Forget it!
You told me not to ask
and I won't.
I won't ask who he is
or why you didn't show yourself.
I won't ask
and you won't say anything.
But take me for a fool!
I had an accident with them
two nights ago.
Where?
Can we go upstairs?
Why you didn't call
an ambulance?
My insurance had run out.
There'd be trouble if the police came.
But it was written in the file
they'd taken him to a clinic.
They took him at 3 am
and he died on the way.
What is it to you?
I checked the skull.
No fracture, no bleeding.
Sahragard said
you didn't check the neck.
I did.
- You didn't open it.
- No need.
I checked your report all night.
What you wrote indicates
the movement of cervical vertebrae.
He had nausea, weakness,
and ptosis for a week.
The lab said
it was definitely botulism.
It was, but it isn't definite
it is the cause of death too.
What if he had
hidden neck fracture in the accident?
How did you hit them?
I don't remember exactly.
He was unbalanced
when I sat him down.
- It would show in the examination.
- It won't!
Not in 1st and 2nd vertebrae.
Only difficulty in movement.
Why you didn't tell me yesterday?
If you had,
I'd have checked thoroughly.
I don't want to blame you.
Does whoever has an accident
go to the corpse and say what he's done?
I did what I always do.
We don't have such a thing
in a general autopsy.
- It was an accident case.
- Who should've told me that?
You keep silent
when you must talk.
Has it ever happened to you
you can't talk?
Yes?
Speaking.
What for?
Miss Azar,
I told your sister what to do.
Put a word for her too.
No, I'm busy. I don't have time.
Welcome.
Goodbye.
Then he sat in the car.
He rubbed the back of his head,
but I was so stupid I didn't notice it.
You aren't sure.
And nothing changes
by blaming yourself.
He might've died
because of the accident.
I know!
But what can you do now?
He wouldn't survive
more than 10 days anyway.
He would live for 3 days at most.
I wish
I'd talked to them yesterday.
Talk about what?
It is only a possibility.
And he wouldn't let you go.
I don't want to justify you,
but you can't do anything now.
Get up! We'll be late.
I can't come. You go.
The key is there.
Would you eat something?
No, go.
- Yes?
- I want to see Habib.
Where is Habib?
- In the yard.
- He wasn't there.
Check the cloakroom too.
Yes?
What the hell!
- I'll kill you!
- What is it?
Where is the rubbish
you give to people?
- Bastard!
- Watch your mouth!
How many people you've ruined?
Where is the shit you give people?
Let go!
Let me kill the motherfucker!
Shut it!
What are you saying?
Let go!
You call yourselves humans?
You know honour?
What are you saying?
You won't understand!
Nobody does!
Bastard! My son died!
What is he saying, Habib?
Nonsense!
It is nonsense, son of a bitch?
Where is the shit?
Talk or I'll thrash you!
- Answer him.
- I don't know him.
You don't?
What's going on?
What's he saying?
He attacks and insults
for no reason.
Call the police.
What are these?
What are these?
Get to work. Leave!
You are humans?
Animals!
What are you saying?
You are Muslims?
Humans?
You give shit to people!
- What is he saying?
- They are the dead chicken.
What are they doing here?
We gather them
and throw them out for the clogs.
Dogs?!
Dog is better than you!
Dog was my son!
I am a dog
who took this shit to my family!
I am a dog because I'm alive!
Shut it! Call the police.
What are you scaring me of?
I buried my whole life yesterday.
Here!
Take these to your family.
2000 each! I'm being kind to you!
What is he saying?
What did you sell him?
He is lying. I don't know him.
You don't know me?
You said everybody bought them.
You don't know me?
Don't stand here. Go away!
I won't go without his body!
Cut it, I said!
Go make a complaint.
Take him out!
Don't stand here.
Don't beat him!
- What did you do again?
- He is lying.
He is?
You sell chicken carcass?
That's not true.
Shut your gob!
Fuck off!
Get lost!
- By God...
- Shut the fuck up!
As if I sold a carcass
and bought a garden!
Out!
Take it.
Sue him.
What's the use?
He says he doesn't know me.
- Where did he sell them?
- At the door.
When did it happen to your child?
May God damn him!
Sue him and get blood money.
Boss wants you.
Get up.
May God grant you patience!
How they'll answer God
in the otherworld!
Can you bring someone?
- Who?
- The cops.
They're removing the carcasses.
I didn't tell you anything.
Sir!
Did you ask?
He says only the name of the disease
is mentioned.
I told you
Forensics would not mention that.
- They only write the cause of death.
- It is good if they write it?
Depends on the judge.
The crime must be proven.
How?
He sold them to my husband.
You are saying that.
You must have proof.
What must I do?
Do you have a witness?
Has anybody seen he sold them?
I don't know.
If it is proven he was guilty,
your husband's sentence might change.
I've been living with him for 15 years.
He hasn't hurt even a fly.
I know,
but it is a criminal case now.
What would you do if
it happened to your son?
What are you saying?
You can't do anything you want
because you were wronged.
What must I do?
I've been coming here for a week.
Talk to a lawyer.
See if you can find a way.
- How much will it cost?
- It is free.
Go to the Counselling Office.
- Where is it?
- On the ground floor.
- They are here now?
- How do I know?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- What did she want?
- At the door?
She wanted us to change the report.
Why?
Yes?
No, I'm in my room.
I'll see it there.
What do you mean?
She wanted us to write
the cause of death clearly.
Hello?
Give it to Sahragard to bring it.
I didn't get her well.
Tell me what she said exactly.
I am!
Wanted us to write,
the cause of death was
the eating of stale chicken.
Why stale chicken?
It seems
the father took dead chicken home.
Someone sold them cheaply
and he bought them.
- He bought chicken carcass?
- I think so.
Put them over there.
- Why wanted it to be in the report?
- The court told her.
- They'll bring new files today.
- I do not know.
Well?
She was very upset.
I didn't understand.
Give me the files!
Please go out!
- Dr Salehi said...
- Please go out! Come when we are done.
Your behaviour is insulting.
- Tell me what she said.
- You're carrying it too far.
Answer me!
What she said exactly?
Her husband goes
to the chicken seller.
Well?
He beats him
and he is in a coma now.
Who is in a coma?
The chicken seller.
Where is the father?
In prison.
Kaveh!
Kaveh!
Kaveh Nariman.
- From?
- Legal Medicine.
- Judge Ahmadi allowed the visit.
- Just a moment.
Your mobile or gun.
You were in the Legal Medicine
that day?
Yes.
Why you didn't tell me then?
I didn't know yet.
I don't know it now either.
I just doubt it.
If you doubted it,
you wouldn't be here now.
That's not so.
There is no doubt
he had botulism.
But the symptoms look like
the neck bone fracture.
He broke his neck
but walked as if nothing happened?
No, it is a medical term.
When the trauma is severe,
the vertebra moves
and a small movement can cause death.
I don't understand.
You write whatever you want.
- The blood test confirmed food poisoning.
- Then why are you here?
Because the cause of death
might be something else.
You say it now?
You wrote my son died
because of the rubbish I gave him.
You ruined me
and threw me out.
My wife doesn't look at me again.
Any idea what it means?
It is only a possibility.
What you didn't say it then?
I didn't do the autopsy.
A colleague did.
Why you didn't do anything
when you found out?
Why?
I don't know!
I thought a lot.
Then I wrote an exhumation request,
but didn't give the letter.
- You were afraid?
- I wasn't sure.
You thought they'd kick you out?
You'd be disgraced?
You are late!
You are late, doctor!
Why you didn't take him
to the hospital that night?
I blew the horn,
signalled the headlights,
but you passed by the clinic.
- I owe you 200,000?
- It isn't about money!
If you had taken him,
he might've...
Why you didn't stop?
He was fine that night.
I took them out to dinner
after a few years.
If I'd taken him to the clinic,
he would survive?
I don't know.
I really don't!
Sir, shall I do it later?
No, go on.
- Don't you need me?
- No, thanks.
- Clip his nails tomorrow.
- Sure.
- Goodbye.
- Go in peace.
- What is Dr Salehi saying?
- What is he saying?
- Get out.
- Say it.
Come out!
What?
- He says you've requested exhumation.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
- Suspicious cases must be autopsied again.
- What will that change?
Suppose for 1%
he died because of the accident.
That is not true.
How can you be so sure?
You didn't check his neck.
It was your fault, not mine.
When a body is there,
everybody comes and says what he's done?
You're repeating yourself.
He didn't have signs of accident injuries.
And poisoning signs were strong.
You should've said it but you didn't!
- I was fucking wrong!
- Be polite!
I was fucking wrong
and I'm paying for it.
He would have died anyway.
That man is going crazy.
He thinks the seller killed his son.
Suppose I made a mistake
and he didn't have botulism.
- Why he didn't take him to a doctor?
- That's no reason for a false report.
I gave a false report?
- Can you be certain he died of botulism?
- He certainly had botulism.
- Can it be the cause of death?
- Lots of people...
Can you be sure?
I've ruined his life.
His son is dead, he is in prison,
and someone is in a coma.
If I'd shown myself that day,
he wouldn't have attacked someone else.
Am I to blame for all that?
Why don't you understand?
I would if it changed anything.
He is stupid, ok.
We told him he killed his own son.
If you didn't work here,
could you show yourself to him?
That's what I'm saying.
I had an accident
and he came here the next day.
- What does it mean?
- Nothing!
You are a doctor.
Don't give me nonsense!
There is only one centre
and all bodies come here.
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen!
OK, do the exhumation!
But if the result is the same,
you have only added another pain.
From Legal Medicine.
Park here.
I was here and called him.
He ran away and I ran after him.
Show us.
How? I ran.
Come!
Soldier, come down.
I got him
and punched him in the forehead.
Forehead or temple?
It hit here.
- Where is the guard?
- Here, sir.
- Where were you?
- In the kiosk.
I heard them
and saw them fighting.
He shouted to me
to call the police.
His shirt was torn.
Then he head-butted me.
Show us.
Then he pushed me to the wall
and grabbed my neck.
You were watching?
Yes, I was calling the police
and saw them.
Then?
He was strangling me
with both hands.
I turned him
and he fell into this.
You pushed him or he fell?
I just wanted to free my neck.
What did you see?
I was coming out.
Didn't see exactly.
Who was the other witness?
- Mr Hesari.
- That's me.
What did you see?
I was going to the warehouse.
- Where is it?
- The big door over there.
They were tangling
and he threw him into that.
- He threw him or he fell?
- I saw him throwing him.
Why are you lying?
How could you see from that far?
Quiet, madam.
Go back!
Why? He can't talk.
Stand back.
You mustn't say anything when I ask.
How could he see them?
Listen to me.
They are friends.
- You mustn't be here.
- Why not?
Legally you mustn't.
I said you must be quiet.
- OK, I'll stay back.
- No, go out.
- Listen to me.
- Quiet! Go out!
By God you'll be punished for it!
By Quran you will!
- Come closer.
- Yes, sir?
He fell or he threw him?
I swear he threw him.
I think he did!
Habib isn't my friend.
What is he saying?
He says you threw him.
I said it again and again
he was choking me.
I took his hand and he fell down.
What do you want to hear?
Slow down!
This door is always open?
Most of the time.
We leave it open
to let out diesel odour.
- Where did he fall exactly?
- I didn't see.
- Louder!
- I didn't see.
How's that possible?
You were there.
What do you want to take from me?
I was holding him till the police came.
- Answer when I ask a question.
- I answer.
Don't make it hard for yourself.
Answer my questions.
Why you talked to my wife like that?
She mustn't be here legally.
Whatever I say
you say it is nonsense legally?
- Answer my questions!
- I won't!
What do you want to do?
Hang me?
If I come out, I'll kill myself.
If I was a man,
I wouldn't bury my son like that.
You've brought
so many people here for what?
Enough! Take him away!
He was killing me.
I told you many times.
Come with me.
- Where was he exactly?
- By the tank.
I think his head had hit that corner.
He was bleeding.
- Amiri?
- Yes.
Write their testimony.
You two come here.
Get back to work.
Close the gate.
I said it ended half an hour ago.
I'll come and we'll talk.
I can't talk now.
All right.
Bye.
She said
he'd live a few days max.
She was telling the truth?
No.
We can't be that certain.
When they'll do it?
Exhumation is on this Tuesday.
- You husband knows?
- Yes.
I got out to tell you this.
I wouldn't do such a thing
if there was another way.
I just ask you to tell your husband
when you visit him...
I don't visit him.
I went a few times
but he didn't show up.
His cellmate said
he was ashamed.
His mother?
Yes.
What did she say?
Wanted to know the result.
You gave her your number?
Yes.
You talked to the inspector
at the crime scene?
- Yes. How come?
- What did he say?
Probably manslaughter. Why?
I meant to tell you since morning.
The child's mother called last night.
The victim died.
The chicken seller?
I shouldn't have told you now.
- Aren't you coming?
- I will.
Hello?
This is Nariman.
Who is on duty tonight?
Who?
Put me through.
Hello.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.
Dr Rafe'i left?
He's changing.
He said you'd fill him in.
They are bringing a body.
Exhumed.
- Tell them to move it gently.
- Sure.
- Put him in the morgue downstairs.
- Sure.
They are here.
I'll come now.
The complainant said
he asked you a few times to call the police.
Yes.
Why you didn't?
I wanted to but my insurance had expired
and the car would be impounded.
- When did your insurance expire?
- A few months ago.
Why you didn't take him
to the hospital?
I wanted to, but no damage was visible
and they didn't want me to go with them.
You didn't notice the family of
the deceased in the Legal Medicine?
I did.
- They saw you too?
- No.
We didn't know he worked there.
You made your statement.
You didn't talk to the family?
No, sir.
Who did the autopsy the 2nd time?
Myself.
I don't have anything here.
Dr Salehi gave the copy
to the court 20 days ago.
Slowly. He is writing it down.
He didn't have the illness?
The Legal Medicine lab
confirmed the illness.
But the main cause of death...
was seemingly the trauma
caused by the accident.
It couldn't be determined
the first day?
It doesn't show itself
in the general autopsy,
but I doubted it
because I knew about the accident.
When did you doubt it?
After the body was given to the family.
And when you requested exhumation?
10 or 12 days later.
13 days later, right?
You realised it that night
but requested exhumation 13 days later?
Yes.
Why?
I don't know.
You are a member
of the judiciary system.
You know your statement
is considered confession.
Yes.
Is there anything else
you want to add?
I can't think of anything.
All right.
You will be bailed out
until you are sentenced.
Sign your statement.
You too.
Will you give the key?
- You have my mobile?
- Yes.
Why you didn't say
you gave them money?
What?
The money you gave them
that night.
It wasn't necessary.
It wasn't necessary
or you didn't want to?
I didn't remember it.
And you didn't remember
they passed by the hospital!
The judge didn't ask anything.
What?
Pull over.
Why you returned that night
and did the autopsy?
You asked me 10 times.
I was worried
and I wanted to know the result.
Why do you ask?
I've been doing this for 11 years.
I don't understand.
Don't go!
Stop!
Look at me.
That boy
really died of the accident?
