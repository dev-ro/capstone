IF EVERYTHING SEEMS UNDER CONTROL
YOU'RE NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH
Keep it up,
but don't push it too much !
Use the exit.
Dad, I've got him in front of me,
I'm going to pass.
Don't attack before the variant !
Shit !
No, fuck !
Oh, Nico !
My father prays every time
I'm about to get in the car.
Our Lord of the blood
that flows in the darkness of my veins...
hold my arm on the steering wheel.
Dad, I've got him in line !
He's a bit scared for me
and a bit scared
I won't go fast enough.
Dad, can you hear me ?
Dad, say something !
Control the strength of my feet
on the accelerator and brake,
help me to dare the impossible.
Fuck, fuck...
Keep me from the temptation
to dare the impossible.
Dissolve the black ghosts
I carry inside.
Mario !
Protect me
and make it...
that nothing happens to me.
You always say,
Don't take on every corner
as if it were the last,
because there'll always be
another one after it.
Don't think about the corner ahead
but the one you can't see.
Annarella !
I'm staying home.
What are you doing up there,
sweetheart ?
I'm not coming, baby.
Don't.
I've got lots to do
before it gets dark.
Baby, it's nine in the morning,
it's not dark.
Come on, I'll help you get ready,
come down.
Come on, darling, don't give me
a hard time, not today.
I can't get down.
Loris is here, He'll help you.
- Loris !
- Hey.
- Tonino !
- Loris !
I knew you'd come.
Hi, Loris.
Hi.
She's your sister.
Giulia.
This is Nico.
Is he your son ?
My brother.
- So he's my brother too ?
- Yes.
Come here.
Little guy.
- Who made him ?
- Mom.
- Why, is Mum back ?
- Yes, but...
Then she left again.
Hey, wait a minute.
- Let me see him, please.
- What ?
Open the coffin,
my father's in there.
- I can't.
- What the fuck are you saying ?
Let me see him! It's my father,
I want to say goodbye.
- I can't, it's already been zinced.
- It's easy to open, give me that !
Keep your hands to yourself !
What the fuck are you thinking ?
Let him see, it's his right.
- No, I can't.
- Come on !
Come back here !
What are you doing ? Come here.
Come out.
Loris !
Climb up, come on, Loris !
Give me your hand.
Don't be like that, come on.
Loris !
Why are you in the dark ?
I'm getting my cross wrench.
What for ?
They're 25 years old, I bought them
and I'm taking them home.
Tonino, there are still six races.
Who cares if they've thrown us
out of the garage.
Yeah, right, absolutely.
Do you want to go too ?
Giulia, I'd stay for you for free,
but it's just me.
The others all worked with Mario
and you can't pay them.
On my own, I can't do anything here.
Listen to me,
Minotti lent Dad money
for the car, for parts,
for registration fees
and all the preparation.
If I don't win the championship,
he'll take this house,
and my brother and I will end up
on the street,
and I'm a minor, I can't end up
on the street with my brother, Is that clear ?
I grew up in this house,
it's all I have left of Mom and Dad,
I'm not letting Minotti get it,
I swear to God.
I'll be expecting you
on Saturday morning.
Let me in.
Annarella, let's go !
Nico, who is it ?
Hello.
Well ?
- This is my brother Livio.
- I know, I saw him the other day.
I think his name's Nico.
- You've changed everything.
- No, it's always been like this.
Right, it's nice.
- We'll be fine here, right ?
- Yes.
You can't stay here.
- Why ?
- Because this is our house.
That's right, our house,
more mine than anyone's, actually.
You can't just show up after 10 years
and say this is your house.
I'm entitled something
for the loss of my father.
I'm his child too,
why don't you care about me ?
Because you're a junkie.
What the fuck are you looking at ?
Do you want to call the cops ?
Call, let's see what they say.
This is my house, I'm staying.
You wrecked my car !
You're out of your mind,
what are you doing ?
- Go!
- You're out of it...
- Go!
- Are you crazy?
- You too, move!
- You're not right in the head.
I don't want to see you
here again, OK ?
Fuck you
It's all right, don't worry.
40 Torx.
Loris is here.
With a short lady.
Giulia, your mother lost
legal custody years ago,
the judge ruled her unavailable.
She isn't, she lives in Canada.
Yeah, right...
And how do you know ?
How long since you spoke to her ?
Have you got her number ?
You're 17,
so by, law you can go
and live on your own.
But your brother, Nico, can't,
his presence in the house
resolves the issue.
What's Nico's relationship
with Loris ?
He doesn't even know him,
my father hasn't let him
in the house for 10 years.
No, it's me,
I didn't want to come back
after Mom left.
See, you don't know anything.
This is a form that states you assume
responsibility for the minors.
You declare that you will see to
the children's education...
No, not with a felt tip.
Take this one.
You declare that you will look after
their education and so on.
Then there's the self-certification
of your personal conduct,
where you declare you don't have
any legal matters pending,
that you don't use
prohibited substances...
What the fuck is this ?
He's signing a false statement,
he just wants
to steal everything as usual.
Is that what he said ?
He told you that ?
Of course...
Who knows how many
other things he hasn't told you.
Listen, you're obliging two minors to
keep a drug addict in the house.
Giulia, think before you speak,
because if you declare that,
I have to take note of it
and declare him unsuitable.
But for now there's no choice,
if he doesn't stay with you, and
there are no other close relatives,
the court will foster you out
immediately.
May I ?
Do I sign here ?
- And you're under observation.
- Obviously.
There.
This is my room.
Do I have to give it back ?
Be only right.
But it's my room now.
- Let's play for it, ok ?
- No.
YES.
Do you know how to get out
without taking the stairs ?
- You can't.
- You can.
- No.
- Yes, you can, wanna bet ?
Mom taught me.
- Hey, do you remember Mom ?
- No.
Mom
had this incredible yellow dress
and she was always smiling.
You don't smile much, do you ?
Smiley !
It's like this, if I make it back up
on my own, you're out.
But if I break an ankle,
the room's yours.
What are you doing there ?
Can I come too ?
No.
Will you be back tonight ?
It's highly likely.
How long are they staying ?
I don't know.
He says it's his room.
Well, it is.
They finished the milk.
Come on, Nico, hurry up !
That history teacher is gonna kill me
Did you cut school ?
You have to go to school,
school's a serious thing, take my word.
Is there any wood ?
I want to do the barbecue.
I took this because...
well, you've outgrown it.
There's a bunch of stuff
in the house just sitting there.
If you need money,
you could sell something.
The cutlery in the living room
are sterling silver,
they buy it at 20 cents a gram.
Are you eating with us ?
I thought I'd make potatoes,
you feel like some ?
Loris, we don't need to talk,
or eat together, or like each other,
is that clear ?
Giulia, have you ever taken
benzodiazepine ?
I can't kill you because
unfortunately I'm not crazy,
but I'm asking you, I'm begging you,
leave me and my brother in peace,
is it that hard ?
You mix it with fruit juice
and then afterwards you're calm.
Once I hypnotized myself !
I took 50 drops.
You'd better take less.
This is my Evo 2.
The Turbo 16.
He kept this fucking casket.
Why did he keep it, the crazy maniac ?
What the fuck did you keep it for ?
Why did the fuck did you keep it ?
I'll leave your horsey here, I know
you care about it, don't worry.
I've never seen you in a jacket,
are you cold ?
Push from there.
We can't do it, there were two of us
and we could barely do it.
- Well, there are two of us.
- Two men.
- And my age starts with a 7.
- Push.
What's all this noise ?
There are people sleeping.
Still with this car ?
Hey, push
Well ?
What ?
Can't you see she can't do it ?
What do I care ?
Don't be like that, help your sister.
Pain in the ass.
One, two, three !
Push!
Let's go.
Sure, but when we get there,
how will we manage ?
We'll find a Romanian
and we'll give him 100 euros.
100 euros ?
Here I am !
Give me 80 and I'll come.
Come on.
All right, 70.
Yeah right, 70.
50!
It's a gift !
I'm your Romanian, come on !
All right, 40,
and you help us unload too.
Sure, wait a moment.
Just a moment !
The final laps
for these Formula 3 drivers,
these youngsters
who dream of Formula 1.
This round of the Italian GT
championship is about to begin,
here at Imola
for the second race of the season.
In pole the Antonelli Motorsport
Porsche Gagà driven by Martinez,
the Curti in the Ferrari MP1
and Fulgenzi in the Porsche Heaven.
Good to see you here.
If you need anything, just ask.
Will you lend us an assistant
mechanic for the weekend ?
See ? We don't need you.
Break a leg !
Loris, you're back.
Giulia,
I get my 40 euros
even if you screw up.
Because you're going to screw it
up today, I'm telling you now.
You done ?
- Hey, that's Loris De Martino.
- Who's that ?
He was the Dancer,
he was hot shit.
- Used to wreck 'em, now you fix 'em.
- One !
I only wrecked one.
Dancer, what happened to you ?
What happened to you ?
Who the fuck are you ?
As the cars come back in,
there's a few minutes till the start.
Basili is leading with 20 points,
in the Team Minotti Lambo,
followed on 15 by Fulgenzi
in the Porsche Heaven.
Our Lord of the blood that runs
in the darkness of our veins...
protect me
and don't let anything happen to me.
...Here's the pack, really tight,
waiting for the green light.
That's it, they're off !
Feet down on the accelerators.
Still all together
at the first chicane,
really going after it for first
place, Antonelli's Porsche Gagà
and the MP1 Corse Ferrari.
Big test of character for De Martino
who despite her recent loss
has decided to race here at Imola.
Unfortunately,
she's off the leading group,
a poor start from the Imola driver
who risks being caught by the Porsche
and the Lambo behind her.
Leave some space.
The one in front is too far away.
Wait for the high variant, well done.
Go for her at the Rivazza
because she'll be out of place.
You feel it more on the exit.
Take it on the right.
See if she leaves space...
A duel begins between De Martino
and Minotti's Lamborghini,
The Lambo attacks
but De Martino closes.
Neck and neck ! De Martino does not
want to give up her position.
But now Basili pushes De Martino
aside and comes in from the left.
Overtakes De Martino who is attacked
now at the Tosa
by the Easy Race
and Baldini Ferraris.
The two coming into contact again.
The orange and blue Porsche
stuck dangerously on the track.
Shit!
Your sister's a bit dangerous.
What do I care.
De Martino has slipped back
but seems determined to make it up.
Really going for Fulgenzi's Porsche
now.
At the Tamburello
why don't you pass kerbside ?
She's driving too clean.
She's scared of breaking it.
Yeah, breaking it...
If it breaks, you fix it !
Go ahead and laugh, if she doesn't
win, you lose the house.
We lose the house ?
Tonino, we lose my house ?
We didn't have enough sponsors
and your father put the house up
as security with Minotti.
No, fuck !
Shit, no !
Shit !
De Martino is still on zero points
after going out at Monza.
She's behind here as well,
but the race is far from over !
What the fuck was Dad thinking
putting her in this junk ?
The usual dumbass fool !
- He said that Giulia is a champion.
- Champion, champion...
Everyone's a champion here.
Fulgenzi coming back
on the Tamburello curve.
Why doesn't she close him off ?
Close him off!
Dancer, take the girl home,
you're hurting each other.
A crash, a Lambo into the wall,
debris flying everywhere !
The cars are zigzagging in
the middle of the track to avoid it !
Fuck!
Good, let him feel your breath
on his neck.
Left, right, fast.
Left four.
Keep going, keep going !
Stretching right, right.
After the exit.
Squeeze him !
Squeeze him, but don't lose the apex,
you have to exit fast.
See, what you've gained ?
Breathe, you're not breathing.
You always breathe
on the straights at Imola, OK ?
Let your arms go, head up,
you're falling asleep.
Listen to me, he's behind you again.
He's on the right, at the Tamburello
he'll try pass you on the left.
Hold it steady
in the center of the track.
Good!
Brake 10 meters early
and close him off before the kerb.
He's going faster
and they've already waved the flag.
What the fuck should I do ?
Open out or close him off ?
Close him off.
- Cut.
- I can't hear you.
Cut the curve !
Don't round it, cut it !
Fuck, she's doing the curves wide.
You have to straighten the curves !
Take the curve straight !
Over the line really fast, but second
place is the Team Minotti Lambo,
driven by Basili who with that
placing move to top of the table !
That'll do, guys !
She's driving like he's at Luna Park.
And young De Martino's Porsche
picks up her first four points,
but only finishes seventh.
You took the curve wide,
I told you to cut it!
You would've saved two tenths
and sailed in fifth.
You drive too clean,
you do the curves wide,
too wide.
What the fuck, are you crying ?
Well, so you should,
you ran a shit race.
Darling, there's foam.
They all recognized me.
You should have heard them.
"There's the Dancer !"
“Hey, Dancer !"
"Hi, Dancer !"
My dancing love.
That was a crap race you did.
There were bubbles.
Listen, this is what we'll do
this is your bathroom,
don't come into ours,
don't ever take our towels,
understood ?
And don't drink from the kid's glass,
or touch his milk.
Do what you want outside the house,
but no getting high at home.
30 euros a day.
Fuck!
- Expensive for a bath.
- No, you'll train me.
You'll give me a hand.
- I'll train you ?
- Every day.
And I'll give you 30 euros
and feed you both.
Train you how ?
You could have left Nico with me,
I was so lonely.
I'm not leaving Nico with you,
because you're a junkie.
- Am I right ?
- Yes, you're right.
Turn it on, it's getting cold.
Stop it, we're talking about work.
Let me turn it on.
Keep you damn hands still !
I can't even hear what she's saying.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Asshole, you hurt me.
I'm sorry, baby.
Go away, everything was so nice.
It was so nice with the bubbles,
what's the matter with you two ?
Baby, I'm sorry.
Loris !
Do you want to sell something ?
Take my first communion bracelet,
leave the car alone.
What's this neck,
do you think it's gonna work ?
It's the neck of a humming bird.
- These scrawny shoulders...
- Fuck you.
They're pitiful,
you need to work out.
And look at your legs.
Like those on those little animals,
the ones with two little paws...
- That little...
- What animal?
You were right to choose Loris.
Loris is the right guy.
What's your heartbeat
when you're racing ?
130.
You have to do 90-130.
- Driver's weight ?
- 49.
Good, a point for us, godammit !
49 ? Excellent !
And then
there's something very difficult,
but I won't tell you now.
- Why won't you tell me now ?
- Actually, I will tell you now.
You know, yesterday with I said,
"Cut it" ?
You shouldn't cut
the curve completely...
I mean, you have to cut the curve,
but when I say, "cut it", it means...
- When...
- You're not well.
Dammit, I've been thinking about it
all morning.
I'll tell you later, I need a hit.
Go get the bike.
What the fuck !
Follow me
and we'll try it out.
It's 30 degrees,
why do I need the coat ?
Do you trust me ?
No, I don't.
Come on, push it !
You're going twenty an hour.
Come on !
Ezio !
We're not there with the heart rate.
Asshole, you've got
the nerve to show up here ?
Take it easy, Loris is a friend.
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.
Who's the cyclist in the coat ?
- That's my sister.
- Ah, a De Martino.
I'm sorry about your father.
I need a hand,
four kick-ass suspensions
and some brake pads
and some hundred octane, yours.
For that heap of junk,
I can give you a pipe from my boiler.
And as for the hundred octane,
forget it.
No, Porsche 997,
GT championship.
I'll pay, I'll pay!
My son was in there ten months ago.
What happened ?
A ditch, he fucked up.
- Down by the windmills ?
- No...
This new clandestine thing.
A much bigger race,
they call it 'Italian Race'.
People with money finance it.
Two were killed last year.
And what is it ?
Shit, that's what it is.
Go straight, Smiley !
Stop or you'll go through
to the other side.
I thought I saw a rainbow.
Do you believe in rainbows ?
Why ? Do you have to believe in them ?
I think they really exist.
Really ?
Breathe, throw it out.
I'm teaching you to brake.
To brake seriously, you have
to lift more than just this stuff.
You have to lift much more...
You have to lift...
two Annarellas.
Annarella !
Don't give crackling to Pira,
it's bad for her.
- Where are you going ?
- Wait for me here.
What the fuck are you doing ?
- You were sleeping, I caught you.
- Loris !
Look what I've brought you.
What an asshole.
What an asshole !
- What the fuck does it cost you ?
- I don't know fucking all.
Great !
- Who's your alcoholic friend ?
- Lorenzo, he's a legend.
Where are we going ?
"Where are we going ? What are we
doing? What aren't we doing ?"
Jeez, you're a pain.
You don't know how to live.
Right, left...
Left, right, left...
Left, left, right, right.
At that speed,
the brake is like a thingy...
...that metal thing you pull...
It's hard.
Take it from down there,
right by the trees, gas down, cross,
sideskid into the skittles,
without touching any of them.
- Gas and brake.
-Why ?
Because you have to give me
today's 30 euros,
that's why.
Did you give me yesterday's ?
Shit, yeah, you did.
San Donato in third,
steady on the kerb
and accelerate but not too much.
Then you pull third
to the limit at the first S,
left, right and then let it rip
with fourth and fifth.
Holy shit, I've got it all here,
because I'm the man.
The grip, you gotta feel it
with your ass, gas and brake !
What are you thinking ?
I'll tell you.
You're thinking of something
and you shouldn't
be thinking of anything.
Anything !
On the wet there are puddles,
use them !
Side crossing is fundamental,
on the track,
to control your trajectory.
That's bullshit,
I'm not driving rally.
You're so ignorant.
How did Dad train you ?
You were right to choose me.
How many are you at ?
- You were counting.
- Then let's start again, one...
two...
three...
27...
28...
You have to feel the grip
with your ass!
Gas and brake !
There she is !
There she is !
There she is,
parking between two pins !
Great job Giulia, way to go !
How does it feel ?
Good!
Take it from me
because at the first Arrabbiata
the kerb's been lengthened
and raised going in and out,
don't think you can cut it and make
it good to the second Arrabbiata,
see what can happen.
In case of a fire on board,
area F is set up.
Drive with your head
and may the best pilot win.
The cars are going round, waiting
for the green light here at Mugello.
The crowd are in a frenzy waiting
for the start. There it is !
Green light, they're off,
and the tight group is ready
for the San Donato !
De Martino continues to attack
the Porsche Heaven,
but it shuts her out.
Go, keep it UP !
But here's De Martino
with a dummy left-right.
Good girl !
She gets inside
of the Heaven Motorsport Porsche.
Minotti's Lambo is still
in the lead ! Ah, a crash !
Incredible,
for the official Team Audi !
And now De Martino
has taken second place.
Not far behind Antonelli's Porsche
and the MP1 Ferrari fight for third.
Go like that, stay with it !
Last thrilling lap with De Martino
in second place
with Minotti's Lambo
right on her tail.
Right behind the Ferrari MP1, which
has passed the Antonelli Porsche.
Go in neat, go up the kerb.
They've raised it, dickhead !
If you'd been at the briefing
you'd know.
Bullshit! Stay on the gas,
anticipate, go up on the kerb.
- That way you'll pass Basili !
- That way I'll break everything !
Go up on the kerb !
No!
Incredible, De Martino hits the white
line on the final lap and slips !
The MP1 Ferrari takes advantage
to grab second place !
And the winner is Gianluca Basili.
Now the podium.
Giulia De Martino, third position.
Get down.
Get down from there.
- You let him sail through.
- It's your fault.
You drove like shit.
Are you stupid ?
Leave me alone.
Now she's throwing cups...
You're out of your mind.
Leave that cup alone !
So, what is it ?
You came third, you did well.
I could have won,
coming third's useless.
' Win ?
- Yes, ?
With a junkie and that old man ?
You'll never give me my money
back with racing, you know it too.
You know what the Italian Race is ?
- Yes.
- This year it's different.
Knockout tournament
and I need a good driver
who's ready to take risks.
You're getting good
and you have to take a few risks.
If you come with me and win
you don't owe me a single euro.
Still sulking ?
Dad used to say it's wrong to anticipate,
you risk crashing out.
Forget Dad, he never won shit.
In fact, he never took risks,
Loris took them.
Listen to me, dammit !
I made dinner.
- Where's Annarella ?
- Been in the bathroom for an hour.
She told me not to disturb her
under any circumstances.
Annarella !
Open the door, Annarella !
Baby, open UP !
Fuck, open LIP !
Fuck, fuck, fuck...
Baby !
Darling !
Stay with me !
Stay with me !
Go and get the blue phial
that's in my room, run !
- Where the fuck is it ?
- In the dresser drawer, hurry !
Darling !
- She needs an ambulance.
- No, take her arm.
She needs an ambulance !
Take her fucking arm !
Squeeze it hard.
Harder, harder !
Darling !
Don't fall asleep.
I didn't want him to see me
like this.
Nico and I
have been together all day.
I know, baby.
- Was I good ?
- Yes.
- I made him a smoothie.
- You've been very good.
Hello, darling, hello.
Let's go away.
I can't go away now.
Darling, I've never had a TV
or even a washing machine.
I never eat breakfast,
I don't even like it.
I've tried, but I'm not like this.
I try,
I try with all my heart, but I can't.
Let's go away, please.
I can't.
Hi.
Break a leg.
Right.
What did he want ?
How are you ?
It's been a shitty day,
I feel really bad.
Will you tell me
what he wanted, please ?
He offered me a race
to repay the debt.
What race ?
The Italian Race.
See ?
See that I'm right ?
That it's not worth fighting
for anything.
I'm an idiot, because I trust people.
I'm here with you
trying to be a normal person,
fuck it !
Because I think
we're brothers and sisters,
that at least you can trust
your family.
But I always get screwed over ?
I said no,
because we're going to win
the championship.
Godammit !
Yes, we're going to win
the championship !
We're going to win the championship !
We're going to win it, right ?
The De Martinos
win the championship.
We're going to win
the GT championship this year.
But we can play video games later.
What are you looking at ? Let's go.
Everyone's going
to Michele's to play.
- And you're not going ?
- No, I'm not.
Come with me,
but you carry this.
Not on both shoulders, like a loser.
It's heavy.
Which one's Michele ?
It's a nice sunny day, it's hot,
makes you want to play outside.
Why don't you come
to our amazing garden ?
We have to go to my house.
I've got three swings, a soccer
field, volleyball net and PES.
- You've got an Olympic pool ?
- No.
- Well, Nico has it.
- I don't believe you.
That's my car,
it's for thrill seekers.
But we haven't got a pool.
Smiley, you might live
to be a hundred,
but they'll be years
of unhappiness and sadness.
Who wants a swim ? Let's go.
Let's go
Got a light ?
No.
What a temper !
Guys !
Godammit, let's move.
Get undressed, come on.
Careful !
Amoebas,
look at me !
- Who jumped from the low one ?
- Me !
Who jumped from the high one ?
Me !
Matteo, you were
at Giulio's with Francesco.
Giulio, obviously you were
at Francesco's with Matteo.
And Francesco was at Matteo's
with Giulio,
Livio was a Michele's.
And Michele, who's already
called home, was at Livio's.
But there's no Livio.
Don't be a pain in the ass.
And me and Nico, you've never seen us.
Cross your fingers and if you tell,
you're a snitch, you'll go to hell.
And who was I with,
with Matteo or with Francesco ?
What a bunch of retards.
You know why you're not improving ?
Because we haven't got enough money
for simulations and testing ?
We don't understand each other.
You're training for control and
working well on holding the track,
but you're scared of anticipating.
You have to anticipate the curve
before you even see it, OK ?
The curve you can see isn't
important, but the one after it.
Loris, enough with all this story
about anticipating.
There's no anticipating curves,
I work on clean trajectories
and if we wreck the car, it's over.
What the fuck are you doing ?
- Excuse me.
- What do you want ?
Fuck!
What the fuck are you doing ?
You've had it, piece of shit !
What the fuck are you doing ?
Move, I'm not driving.
Move it, 'cause these guys
are real criminals.
Fucking hell.
Now I want to see what happens
with your clean driving.
I don't even have a driver's license.
Fuck, move !
You have to be a racer,
you have to anticipate the curves.
- You have to take risks.
- We're in town.
YES.
In fact, there's the dance school.
- Where the fuck you going, asshole ?
- Fuck !
God...
Annarella used to teach there.
This rattletrap barely goes !
This rattletrap did 140 in third
when yours truly drove it.
That Way !
Why do you do only nonsense things ?!
Dad knew that to win
you have to take risks.
And you have to have fun.
I'm not having
any fucking fun at all!
You think too much:
the house, Nico, money...
You just have
to anticipate the curves.
Side cross, kickback...
- I'll total it!
- You'll total my car ?
Would you do me the favor of
anticipating the curves, please ?
Here she is.
Wait a minute...
That's it, good !
Son of a bitch !
- Where are they ?
- They turned left.
Watch out for Granny.
- Where the fuck are they ?
- I don't know !
Loris, what do I do ?
Turn right.
No, left.
Now...
right, turn back.
Maestro...
You need to call me maestro.
Fuck you, Loris, get out !
- Get out !
- But it's raining.
Giulia De Martino !
Fly !
De Martino dangerously approaches
Pisischella's Porsche.
Side by side at the Tamburello !
It's pedal to the metal !
Holy moly, what a duel !
Come on !
Antonelli spins out !
What bravery, De Martino wins
her first race of the season.
Go!
You're the best Giulia !
How about that !
Loris De Martino gives lessons.
It's a fight from the start ! The
Porsche and Lamborghini at the bend.
Team Minotti's Lambo uses the bend
to take third place.
But De Martino's Porsche
is putting in another fast lap.
Go, Giulia !
De Martino passes Gaudiano and moves
alongside the yellow Eurotech Lambo
driven by Giambarresi.
Fast laps, one after another,
Record T 2 and T 3.
De Martino is racing
after second place.
Forget Basili, he' losing oil,
in three laps he'll be in pit lane.
He's in my trajectory.
Keep on him and hold your position.
We're on the last lap.
The Team Minotti Lambo holds second,
closely followed by De Martino.
Minotti's Lambo
is losing oil and stops.
Giulia De Martino finishes second
And go I
and moves up to third overall.
I open everything, I keep left,
I break away at 150 meters,
sixth, fifth, fourth, third,
at San Donato I go for it,
I open out on the exit,
I keep right, then open it all up,
soft left and I go on the kerb
at Luco,
I close to the right, do it sharp,
I open third, fourth, fifth
until Materassi and San Lorenzo,
at Casanova I break away,
fourth, keep right,
and I stay steady, then pull away
at 150 meters from Scarperia.
No, there you pull away at 130,
or even 120, trust me,
and take Palagio in third,
open a little coming out
and as soon as you feel the kerb,
straight into fourth.
Then fifth up to the Correntaio,
sacrifice the entry and go for it,
that way you'll exit faster,
third, fourth, Biondetti,
fifth, changing direction.
Tonino !
Rain.
- What the fuck did the Dancer say ?
- Rain tires.
- Rain ? It's sunny.
- What do we do ?
And put the fucking rains on, move !
What are you doing, putting rains on ?
Can't you tell when I'm joking ?
And Giulia De Martino
wins the race !
Listen.
"The young promise,
Giulia De Martino,
after winning Imola
wows them again
with a podium and another first place
and is just a step away from
the title of Italian GT Champion."
Who's this? Who's this guy ?
"Certainly merit goes
to her new preparer,
her brother Loris De Martino !
Old-time motor-racing glory."
Easy one, “old-time" ?
But you are old.
And you're a dickhead.
Hey ! We never die !
Go on, it's good for you.
Been celebrating.
Wanna smoke a joint ?
I don't use that stuff.
You shouldn't smoke,
or drink, you're a racing driver.
Or else why am I training you ?
You don't know how long it's been
since I had fun like that.
I sang, I danced,
I drank tequila, I fucked in a car.
What did you do in a car ?
I fucked, Loris.
What are you doing,
playing the big brother ?
No, I'm not playing the big brother,
I am your big brother.
- How old are you ? 15, 16 ?
- 17.
- You're too young, you shouldn't.
- What ?
Fuck ?
I take a curve at 200
and you're worried if I have sex ?
That's different.
What a pain.
Shit !
What's wrong ?
It's stained,
it was Mom's and I've stained it.
You know what ?
Fuck her and the dress.
And fuck Dad too !
And fuck that little kid
who never smiles.
Fuck!
I kill myself and he never smiles.
And fuck you too !
Fuck all of you !
Wait.
The world...
No, leave me alone.
Really, threatened with death ?
"Cross your fingers and if you tell,
you're a snitch, you'll go to hell."
- Did you hear that ?
- What ?
Judge, have you ever done
"Cross your fingers..."
I'm not a judge, I'm the principal.
All right, I'm sorry.
Excuse me, I came as soon as I could.
Giulia, you didn't have to come.
You're welcome.
I'm taking care of it.
It seems like, last month, your brother
drove five children in his car,
broke into the council pool
and let them swim
without qualified personnel present.
I was there.
- Then he drove them home.
- Issuing them with death threats.
- Again, really ?
- Be quiet.
Ordering them not to tell the truth
with a non-specified threat.
I'm sorry.
Just a couple of dives.
I knew absolutely nothing about this.
Five children in the hands
of a drug addict.
Let's call things by their name,
without hypocrisy.
I already said I'm sorry.
Luckily nothing happened, right ?
And the lady shouldn't express
personal opinions.
My brother is former racing driver,
perfectly capable of handling
himself and others.
You realize I have to inform the authorities,
there was a break-in.
I understand and I'm sorry,
but we are already
in a difficult position,
I promise I'll come to pick Nico
up from school myself.
But, please, don't get us
into any more trouble.
If someone else had done it,
you know what they would have said ?
"Well done, you took the kids
to the pool to have fun."
I do it and the sky falls in.
That was good when you said
that I was a racing driver
and all that.
You were great.
What's wrong ?
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Do you realize what you've done ?
I took the kids to the pool.
You know the principal
can report you ?
You know what that means ?
That they'll take Nico away
because you're a dickhead
who couldn't pick a kid up
from school and bring him home.
Hey, I'm teaching you how to live,
you and this little retard.
What can you teach ?
Listen to me,
we only have one more race,
if I win it, everything's solved.
Do what the fuck you want.
You want to go and steal ?
Steal, get high, kill yourself.
I couldn't give a shit.
But leave us alone.
Can't you see the shape you're in ?
You're worthless.
You haven't got a job,
you've never done anything,
you're even missing teeth.
And take that fucking brace off,
there's nothing under it.
Fuck you
I let my woman leave
to stay with you.
Go back to her.
It's time to go to bed,
you've got school tomorrow.
I'm not going back
to that shitty school.
What was that ?
He'll be back.
No, he won't.
What the fuck are you doing ?
What the fuck are you doing ?
What do you want ?
- She's my woman.
- Easy, I'm not jealous.
You hear me, buddy ?
Stay calm.
Listen...
Do you want some ?
Take a hike and I'll give you
this little present.
What the fuck are you doing ?
- Take it.
- Take it, he's giving it to you.
- Watch your hands.
- Get your hands off me.
Asshole !
Stop!
Asshole !
You're done, asshole !
This is, like, such crap...
What the fuck are we doing ?
What have you done, brother ?
What the fuck have you done ?
He was on my woman.
They'll come and kick our ass !
Darling, I'm not your woman anymore.
Don't say that.
Thanks for coming.
- Go away
- Let's go home
- What did you come for ?
- Let's go home.
I'm the one who wants you to go,
you only make trouble.
- Go away, Loris.
- Let's go home.
- Go away !
- This is fucked up !
Go!
No, it's that piece of shit !
- Slow down, Giulia !
- Shut up !
Piece of shit !
Loris, what do we do ?
Get out of the fucking way !
Oh my God !
Hold on !
Loris !
Stay calm.
What's that ?
That's a rod for your right leg,
you've got a compound fracture.
I'm sorry.
I've got a race in 3 hours, I have
to go or they'll take my house.
Miss, it's 7:00 in the evening,
you slept for 20 hours.
Where is Loris ?
My brother was with me.
Has something happened to him
and you don't want to tell me ?
What happened to him ?
Where's my brother ?
Keep still.
- Where's my brother ?
- Calm down.
- Where's my brother ?
- Wait.
Why won't you let me see him ?
You won't let me see my brother.
Good morning.
- So, are we ready ?
- Ready.
This is Flavia and Leonardo.
Hi, Nico.
- She said, "hi".
- Hi.
You'll be staying with them
for a while.
Let's go, little guy.
I'll take this.
It's nice to meet you.
Come.
Giulia, please,
let's not complicate things.
Shut up.
If I hid on the roof,
they wouldn't find me, I told you.
They would have found you anyhow.
This isn't our house anymore.
If we make a fuss, they'll send
us away, don't make it worse.
I'm waiting for Loris to come back.
Loris isn't coming back.
He's never coming back.
I want to go with you.
Please, come down.
Coming.
Not the Turbo 16.
Mario kept it alive for 25 years.
So now it's Loris',
it's old, but it's all handmade.
You can even burn it if you like,
but I'm not leaving
the Turbo 16 to him !
What are you doing here ?
Do you still need a driver
for the Italian Race ?
Shut up g
No, what can I do with her ?
I don't want anything for me,
but if I win, you give the house
to my brother and sister.
But you can barely stand up.
Never felt better,
I'm like lightning.
I'm supposed to give you a car ?
What if you wreck it ?
Shut up g
I'll race with my own car,
it's worth your while.
- What car ?
- The Turbo 16.
- The EVO 2 .
- But it's over 20 years old !
But it's doing great for its age,
trust me.
That race is for sickos
and desperates.
What are you ?
Desperate.
There are only
a few of us real desperates left.
Lunch is ready.
Guys, let's go up.
Aurora... Giulia, come on.
Are you looking for someone ?
At the beginning, there's a track
that closes in before a gate,
no more than one car
can go through at a time,
they'll jostle to get in.
Then there's a strip in town,
between the buildings in Matera.
It's crazy,
stuff for psychos.
At the end of the last straight,
there's a blind curve
with a wall
in the middle of the road,
don't push it,
or that's where you die.
I've brought a 3-bar Garrett.
It'll hold.
Mario said, 2.5 was the maximum,
it'll be 700 horses per wheel
on a 900kg car.
There weren't
tires with this grip before.
It'll overbalance to the right
and lose grip even in fifth.
Trust me,
we'll have to take a few risks.
Think fast when you're in there.
Gentlemen, are we ready to dance ?
Open all 5,
left 3 fast, with right 3,
open, 100,
close right 3, 100,
watch the bottle neck,
bump, disconnect,
squeeze into the gate, left 3,
close, left 3, no...
No, left, 2, open 500,
eye on bump, ditch,
open it up.
Come on !
Come on, holy shit !
Holy shit !
Fuck!
Fuck!
Go, Dancer !
Go, Dancer !
Go, Dancer !
Fast left 3.
Go, my beauty ! That's it !
Let's see how this Garrett works !
There it is !
Where are you going ?
Where are you going ?
Now, Dancer,
run away,
run away.
And here he runs away !
Under there.
Wait there, I'm coming !
Did you take it wide ?
Come on, my lovely.
Now I just need to catch you.
No, no, no...
Brake !
Oh, my God
It's not right
that you're here all alone.
Nico will be back in a week.
What about him ?
Do you know where he is ?
Yes, I do.
OK, let's go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Everything OK ?
- Yes, and you ?
Good, thanks.
I'll bring him back at 6:00.
' BYE, Nico.
- Bye.
Are you going to leave or not ?
How many times do I have to tell you ?
I said, "Get out of my house".
This isn't your house, asshole.
It's a cemetery, do you understand,
or is that too complicated for you ?
You're in my garden,
you're bothering me.
Shall I call the cops ?
They're all dead here,
how can I bother them ?
Why do you have to bust my balls ?
Either you go, or I'll kick your ass.
What the fuck...! My sausages !
I'll call the cops, then we'll see
if you get the fuck out of here.
Look at this !
Godammit,
what am I supposed to eat now ?
Come on, let's go.
No, I'm staying here.
I'm leaving.
Smiley !
Smiley !
You came to visit me !
Are you happy ?
