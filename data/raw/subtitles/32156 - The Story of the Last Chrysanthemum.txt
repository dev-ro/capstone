THEATER SHINTOGI (TOKYO)
I hold a grudge against you
You were born as a human
The time has come to
take revenge on you
I am vengeful!
Now is the time
Take this!
Give me some remedy
I'll push you into the river
You'll be eaten by kites and die
That was terrible
Learn from him
You'll never be any good
You drew the curtain too soon!
Move over!
Useless, every one of them.
Useless!
Kikunosuke's no good!
He's a born loser
But he's still young, master
And you were born good, master
Morita is the one!
I'm going to make him
my successor
- Bring Kiku here
- Kikunosuke?
- Yes, now!
- Yes, sir
People say that since
your son was born...
...you have turned you back on
your adopted son
You mustn't scold him so
- Is this the 210th day?
- It was rough going!
Really bad
He was especially bad today
The best he can do is boil
bath-water
Father, you called for me?
- Kikunosuke!
- Please, master...
How was I today?
He's very happy with you,
because you were good
Aren't you, master?
Don't worry about it
Just keep training hard
and you'll make it
I'm very grateful, father
What's wrong, Kiku?
How was I today?
Well...
- You're my friend
- Then tell me the truth
You were good, very good!
Really?
I wonder
Fuku, let's go to Yanagibashi,
my treat
Sorry, I'm busy tonight.
Another time
- You're going to Teishin?
- Yes
I saw you earlier
Thank you
Kikugoro is such a brilliant actor
So what's wrong with his son?
As they say, good father, bad son
Still, he's very popular, isn't he?
Nobody ever criticises him, that's
why he doesn't get any better
He's spoiled
He's inherited the great name of
Kikunosuke from his adoptive father
That's all it is
That's the only reason
he's so popular
He's basking in his father's glory.
Isn't that so?
Listen
Is he here?
Wecome, Kikunosuke.
How long have you been here?
I didn't know
The new play is a great success
Everybody's been talking about you
So young and so good
I'm going home
That's a pity, because Eiryu
will be here soon
And she so wants to see you
She'll be very disappointed
Why, here she is!
Eiryu, you are late
I came as soon as I could
Now he's angry because you're late
Don't blame me
Even the gods will abandon
you one day
I'm so sorry
Are you angry with me?
But you're not angry any more,
are you?
Leave me alone!
Oh, you're so unkind
But I understand
How  could you be happy
with someone like me?
I'm an old maid
I know how popular you are
with the girls
Please be quiet
I can't
I've already been boasting about
you and me to all the others
So if I can't marry you, I'll
have to leave Yanagibashi
I'll have to leave town altogether
I'll leave Tokyo!
Because you made me lose face
You mean it's my duty to marry you
to spare you the emarrassment?
Good evening
I thought you'd given up on him
You said so the other day
Did you forget?
That's not like you
Or have you simply lost your
mind altogether?
And what about you?
Anyway, you're rude, barging
into my room unannounced
Oh, so sorry
But could I ask you a question?
Why do I need your permission
to come and see my boyfriend?
But between you and me...
Listen, Eiryu, everyone in
Yanagibashi knows what you are
So don't put on airs
You know what they say
If you really want him so much...
...I'll let you have him
I don't mind
You don't have to go
behind my back
You won't get away with it
Remember that
Take him away if you can
I'm not merchandise!
Get out!
I'm so sorry about that, Onaka
You really walked into a trap here
Shall we start drinking
all over again?
Oh, get out!
Serves you right!
Wecome home, sir
Otoku, what are you doing here
at this time?
The baby's disturbed
He can't sleep in this heat
Let me off here
Go home now
Goodnight
He's a troublesome child, isn't he?
No, he's very good, usually
But he's not well tonight
He's got an upset tummy
But he's usually so healthy
Is father asleep?
He's still up. He's reading
a new play
Damn
What time is it?
It's 2 already
He'll be going to bed soon.
Let's stay in the cool air
Wind bells!
Here, let me have one
Which one would you like?
One with a nice sound
I'll take this one
Thank you, sir
- Here you are
- Thank you
Sounds nice, doesn't it?
There, he's not cross any more
I went to see you in the play today
Did you?
I took the baby home with me
Auntie was there
She was saying nasty things
about your acting
I'm your baby brother's nurse...
...so it made me angry
But I'd never seen your latest play
So I went to see it on the way home
How was I?
Don't let your admirers' praise
go to your head
You see, I watched you act
Was I bad?
Well...
Was I that bad?
I had to agree with Auntie
I don't care if you get angry,
I'm going to be honest
Please...
One day soon, you will become
Kikugoro the 6th...
...and it's only natural for you
to enjoy youreslf sometimes...
...and find pleasure in the adulation
of your admiring public
But you must not forget
that you are an artist
As your father says:
your art is your life
Without it...
...even Kikugoro the 6th
is just an ordinary man
Sorry to be so impudent
Thank you. Nobody ever said
such things to me before
Don't mention it
Since I've already been rude,
I shall continue
Please keep training hard
and become a great actor
Then your father will be
proud of you
You'll be his true successor
The evening dew will dampen
the baby's clothes
It'll soon be dawn
We'd better go in
It'll be all right.
Follow me
Please forgive me for speaking
so impudently
- Otoku?
- Yes
Thank you
- Has he gone to sleep at last?
- Yes
I wonder where Kikunosuke is
He came home earlier.
He's sleeping
You can go to bed now
I say, Matsu...
Was it last year when you
fell into the river?
Two years ago
You struck a very impressive pose
in the water
The master told me to do it again
because I looked better in the water
He's cruel!
Auntie, where's Kiku?
He went out on his own
to avoid the crowds
How is he these days?
He no longer goes gallivanting
around town as he used to
He now comes straight home
He ignored my advice, then
But do you know the reason
he's not here tonight?
What is it?
Otoku isn't here either
She's at home with the baby
We felt the fireworks would
upset him
Is that what you think?
Well, you're wrong
- You mean...
- Don't be ridiculous
It can't be true
Be careful what you say!
Aren't you going to see
the fireworks?
I don't enjoy them
I don't like the noise
Would you like to have
something cool to eat?
We have watermelons
On the other hand, we should wait
for the others to get back
- How many watermelons are there?
- Five
So we can have one, then
Would you like some?
- Is it cold?
- Yes
They've been cooled all day
It's big, it must be heavy
I'll cut it
Will you? Thank you
It's cold, really cold
I knew it would be
Otoku, come and help me
Hold it down
Good, isn't it?
Hold this for me
I'll do the rest
It's a good one
- Where are you going?
- To the annexe
Here is fine
- But...
- Yes, we'll eat here together
As you say
Let's salt it
And eat it
Don't be shy
Let's eat together
It's delicious
Go on, eat
Let me remove the pips
Listen, Otoku
Because everyone always
praises me to my face...
...and says bad things
behind my back
You were the first ever
to criticise me
I'm very happy...
...that you're so happy
The geisha and all those
other girls like me...
...just because I'm Kikugoro's son
They don't give a fig about my art
If I weren't Kikugoro's son,
nobody would have noticed me
That made me feel so lonely
So when you talked to me
the other day, I was happy
For the first time in my life
I felt really happy
It was like drinking cool water...
...when you're on a long hike
in the mountains
So I've been feeling truly happy
on stage lately
Now I can act for you,
feeling you're there
Your presence makes me feel
secure and confident on stage
I'm going to be a great actor
I'm just beginning to feel I might be
What's wrong?
I'm touched because what I said
makes you as happy as that
I'll work very hard from now on
And I'll do my best to help
and encourage you
I'll do everything I can for you
Thank you, Otoku
- It was so hot
- We should have stayed at home
Welcome home
Onaka!
What were you doing?
Mending the collar of his
night kimono
Go home, Otoku
I'm firing you
Why?
You'd better not ask
The baby's so attached to me
And I didn't do anything wrong
Lady, it's because of him, isn't it?
You have nothing to worry about
I'm completely innocent
Nevertheless...
Why are you being
so kind to him?
What's behind it?
Is it because you hope that
if things go well for you...
...he'll end up marrying you?
Is that it?
That's a terrible thing to say
Kikunosuke is an innocent boy
So stop teasing him
How terrible that you would
think me capable of that
That certainly shouldn't be
a reason to send me away
So what kind of relationship is it?
I just want to do whatever I can
to help him...
...so he can become a good actor
But that's not a maid's job
He's got a great actor in his father,
Kikugoro
And he's got me as well
No, his father lives only for acting
What I'm trying to say is...
...that I can be a nurse
for his acting
That's my job, not yours
All you need to do is nurse the baby
You forget your place,
and you are too ambitious
People are already talking about it
and that's bad enough
So you're fired
Here's the hat
Kikunosuke, are you ready?
There are lots of very distinguished
guests here today
And some actors too
So make sure you behave yourself
as befits a son of your father
Good morning
Lady, where are the baby's clothes?
In the third drawer
I'll be with you in a minute
Mother
Where's Otoku?
I sent her away
Why?
You know why
- Wait. Have you seen Kiku?
- He just rushed out
Oh, dear!
I'm sorry. Kikunosuke's gone
- Come home straight away
- Yes, sir
- No
- Is she out?
Wait. Is Otoku here?
- I don't know
- Where is she?
She's not staying with us
Wait a minute
Wait
Take this
It's all right, just tell me
where she is
- She's gone to a relative's house
- Where is it?
I don't know
Just a minute
I'll be back tomorrow.
Can you find out by then?
Goodbye
Excuse me
Are you Otoku from Iriya...
...by any chance?
Yes, why?
I sell tea at the shrine
I had a customer today who asked
me to come and bring you with me
Who could it be?
- She's over there
- So she came?
Otoku!
How did you find out where I was?
It wasn't easy
I found your house
but couldn't go in
So I stopped a servant who was
sent on an errand and...
- Kanekichi?
- Yes
He was told to say nothing, to
keep your whereabouts secret
But yesterday, I finally talked him
into telling me
You went to so much trouble
just for me?
I'd just found a real friend, only to
have her taken away from me
I was lonely
Young master...
You made me very happy
But if we see each other often,
they'll find out
It's not good for you
So we mustn't see each other again
I don't want that
No, we mustn't
We've been accused of
something we didn't do
If we keep meeting...
...it will be true
I don't care, Otoku
I want to marry you
No, it cannot be
That would ruin your future
You're still young
I'm just a house-painter's daughter
That's got nothing to do with us
You would have to leave your home
I'll leave home, then
Kikunosuke, come here
Kikunosuke!
Come closer
Who's the girl you met today?
Everybody is saying you have been
a fine son to me
You act well and you behave well
They say you are a worthy successor
and that makes me very happy
So this news worries me
You should respect my decision
We sacked Otoku...
...because she was bad for you
Then you go after her
and meet her...
...despite your own father's
objections
If you won't heed my words,
I'll have to take action
Tell me exactly how you feel
about her
Kikunosuke
You mustn't worry your father
Think why you are so popular
They all make a fuss of you
as the young master...
...only because of your father
It can be forgiven because
you're so innocent...
...and you think that everyone is
as innocent and honest as you
...just because you are
the successor
She's not like that
You just don't know women
very well
You're wrong!
You just don't know any girls
apart from geishas and their kind
- They're all the same
- No!
Otoku is different.
She is pure and sincere
No matter! You have to
obey your parents
Kikunosuke, come here!
Come
I'm quite determined about Otoku
But your father doesn't want
to be publically shamed
Otoku was your baby brother's
nurse
She's agreed to give you up
So it's only you who is
making things so difficult
None of you believe it, but
our relationship is pure
I'm very glad to hear it
You shouldn't have
sent Otoku away
You shamed her and destroyed
my happiness for no reason
Kiku, do you know what
people are saying?
They think you're in love
with a nursemaid...
...and that the family is angry
Your father has been
far too kind to you...
...not to have thrown you out
altogether...
...even though he has his
own son now
So you'd better think of him more...
...and work a little harder
Kikunosuke
An actor must be adored
by his public
Only then can he shine
You're only just beginning
to acquire that adoration
I'm tired of adoration
I'd be glad if it was for
my own merit
But I'm living in my father's shadow
That's a terrible thing to say
I don't want to be "the 6th"
And I don't need the family name
- I want to try on my own
- You'll be helpess on your own
I'll prove that I can do it
Take your selfish arrogance
and get out!
Apologise at once!
Apologise to him now!
Father, I beg you
Let me marry Otoku
Please, father
I beg you!
Silence!
Kikunosuke!
Osato!
Good evening
Who's there?
Is Otoku here?
Who are you?
My name is Terajima
Otoku isn't here
Where is she?
Look here, we've been given
strict instructions
We can't let you see her
That's all I can say
Shut the doors!
Excuse me
- Please take this to the girl
- Certainly
And bring back her answer
Young master
I think you were wrong
You were much too harsh
with your father
Matsu!
But we'll talk about it later
Just come home now, please
I promise you that I, Matusuke,
will take care of it all
But you must come back and
apologise before it's too late
I can't apologise
And I won't go back
I see
In that case...
...come and stay at my place
Let me hear all about it and
how you feel about the girl...
...and then we'll decide what to do
Come, young master,
please come with me
Let's go
If you insist on doing
your own thing...
...then go and make yourself
a fine actor
Tamizo is a brave family man
He'll be happy to take you in
But remember
You shouldn't be too dependent
on his kindness
You must work and train very hard
Do you understand?
Let's go
Kiku-chan!
I heard you're going away
I beg you, come back home now,
please
You don't understand
But you mustn't anger your father so
You must consider your
name and family
Say no more. I've had enough
Let me come with you...
...and apologise to him
It's too late
I'm on my own now
And I'll come back successful
Where is she?
Who? Otoku?
Matsu, did they tell her
to stay away from me?
I don't know
Well, goodbye
Won't you change your mind?
Don't try to stop him
Please forgive me
Take care of  yourself
You too. Goodbye
Young master, keep well
Goodbye
One year later
- Where are my sandals?
- I don't know
Watch out!
I'm sorry, I was trying
to get my sandals
Thank you
What's wrong?
I know the young master
is backing him...
...but the boy's reputation
is not good
Maybe we should give the role
to someone else
Tamizo is backing him.
Let him do it
- But...
- It's all right
Let him play it
- What else?
- No, I'll go
Uncle
How do you feel?
Well, thank you
I've come back to life
I'm no ordinary old man
Doctor, I'm getting better, right?
Uncle
My acting is not getting any better
I'm afraid I must be a
terrible burden to you
Don't be silly
Don't worry about what
the others think
Let me tell you this:
an actor cannot improve...
...if he gets too much praise
too soon
None of us was any good
when we were young
We just stay aboard
and keep paddling
Thank you, master
Tamizo is at your side
Thank you
It looks like it's going to rain,
so I thought I'd bring this
Very kind, thank you
Kiku-chan, what's bothering you?
Tamizo...
I'm no good
You and uncle always
stand up for me
He's just cheered me up once more
But I feel I should go away
Where would you go?
I'm not good enough
for your theatre
So I'll join a touring troupe
Or, Otsuru, maybe I should ask
your father to train me...
...and become a masseur
Listen, Tami-chan
When you are young...
...it's so easy to waste your time
You must keep training in your art
and do it well
Otsuru, I'm going home
Goodbye, then
Young master, they want
your hairpin
Then give it to them
Young master!
When did you come?
Just now
I came here straight away
to see you on the stage
That is a surprise
I didn't expect you
We didn't know you had
a secret sweetheart
Why didn't you come to Osaka with me?
Your family told my parents
not to let me out of the house
I thought so
But when I heard of your troubles,
I couldn't take it any more...
...so I ran away
I've been very unpopular in
every role I've played here
I completely lost faith in myself
this last year
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd been with me
If you hadn't arrived tonight,
I would have been gone for good
It's all my fault
I had confidence when I left Tokyo
But now I know - I'm just no good
That's not true
I can see the improvement
you made
No one else could see that
You've acquired a quality
you never had before
You mustn't give up now
What you were unable to do
in Tokyo...
...you've managed to acheive
here in Osaka
Do you really think so?
I hope you're right
I am, so keep up your spirits
I will
This is it
- I'm home
- Welcome
Welcome
Come in
I'm surprised you live
in such a place
Thank you!
There's the cushion - it's for you
Is that all you brought?
There's more. But I left my things
at the station
We'll go and get them tomorrow
Can I stay here?
Of course, we are married now
No, I just want to help you become
really good and then take you home
Then what?
Then...
I don't know
Don't be so distant
Have some
The play's over
You can tell by that drum
it's all different from Tokyo
Won't you rest a little?
You need it
But I promised to have this
finished by noon
I wish you didn't have to do
this kind of work...
...but it won't be long now
Bear with me
Don't worry
Look, Otoku...
Gonta and Koremori
can be great roles
And Yoshitsune are family plays,
right?
So if I perform these roles well
I might change my bad reputation
Of course, I'm sure you will
I can do it
I'm sure this time
I'm sure too
- The furniture's arrived
- Really?
Be careful
I don't mind if you get hurt,
but don't scratch the mirror
Don't say that!
Can't you be a bit more careful?
I'm sorry
Take it back down, please
Will you came here for a minute?
It's wonderful
Where did you get it?
It's for you
To be a good actor...
...you need a proper dressing-table
It's wonderful
I'm so happy
It's a lovely mirror
- Can't I have one like it?
- Impossible
What about money?
Don't worry about it
I sold things I didn't need
Thank you
Otoku is an admirable woman
and very resourceful
Excuse me!
Kiku-chan, it's terrible!
The master has died
Uncle?
But yesterday he was...
It was so sudden,
we're all shocked
I'm worried
We had to make a few changes
in the cast
I'm sorry about that, but...
...we have to lay you off
I'm sorry
I know it will be hard for you, as
you were counting on these roles
We've got Onishi's
travelling troupe here
It will bring us more business
Please think about it
Well, what do you think?
I'm sorry
With old Tamizo dead, our
theatre feels like a funeral
It must be a great shock to you
Won't you come with us?
We'll give you an advance
Good pay - the best!
How much advance?
Let me see... 15 yen?
How about it?
Here you are
Can't you stay and train in Osaka
in stead of going on the road?
I don't want to leave, but
what about next month?
Without uncle, there's nothing
we can achieve in Osaka
All we can do is quit
And I'm sure you'll enjoy it too
- Don't you agree?
- Definitely
Four years later
- That's not enough
- That's all we've got
We can't work under
these conditions
Then quit!
Can you go without
your leading actors?
We can get on very well
wihout any of you!
You're just ham actors
Go wherever you like!
All right, I will.
Give me my wages.
I don't have them
Don't be like that
Fighting again?
They waste time over money...
...but what about the play?
I hate it
I know we shouldn't be
in a travelling troupe
It's been four years
You picked a bad man
to share your life with
You can always leave
It's for you that I feel like this
I can't bear to see you wasting
yourself on this touring
It's none of your business,
I like it
I'm doing all right
They like anything you do,
it's fun
Forget it and give me some money
Going out?
Out to enjoy myself
There's no money!
But we got some yesterday
I put it aside to buy you new socks
and underwear. Yours are too old
Give it to me
You've changed so much
There you go again
I don't need your advice
Can't you speak nicely to me
once in a while?
Don't forget how you felt
when you left Tokyo
How did I feel?
It's a lost dream
Give me that money
I will not
You were going to make it
on your own
You said so yourself
So I have, haven't I?
I can play any part,
even children's roles
You won't listen to me
- Give it here
- No!
It's all your fault
Here
I'm so sorry
Forgive me
Go out and enjoy yourself
Aren't you going out?
Then go to your room and sleep
Otoku
Keep this money
But...
Take it!
Listen, everybody!
Something terrible has happened
We were told to leave
But there are days left
in our contract
You're unpopular, so you're out
and women wrestlers are in
Who do you think you are?
We're human beings
So let's talk like human beings
Talk?
Get out of here!
- Where's our manager?
- Wait!
From what we hear,
he's run away
- Who are you?
- Women wrestlers
We weren't told anything about it
Maybe not, but your manager
made a deal with us
This man says you're leaving
tonight
Forget about them.
You there, get busy
Wait till the manager gets here
I don't have time
Get to work. Now!
- Listen to me!
- Where is your manager?
Listen, the manager and the boss
have run off
You see? You talk too much
Move over, you're in our way
How dare you?
Get out of here!
What shall we do?
What are you going to do?
There's nothing we can do but go to
the director's place and talk to him
Nice to have a place to go to
Are you staying?
Five sen for two
This way
1 sen and 8 rin for bedding
You must have caught a cold
You should take more care
I saw an advert for a play today
It's a Tokyo drama
A drama?
They charge 1 yen 20
That's a month's food money
Where is it?
In Nagoya, Suehiroza
Who's in it?
Shikan... and Fukusuke...
Wonderful!
This is a gift from the gods
You can go and see Fukusuke
and talk to him
I can't. I won't let Fuku
see me like this
Maybe he'll give you a part
He won't
He might have done if
I were still in Osaka
But not in the state I'm in now
But you've improved
I don't think your acting's got worse
People say that if you do well
in Nagoya...
...your next step will be Tokyo
You'll come back victorious
It's time to put it to the test
Please try
It's no use. You can't go asking
favours from an old friend
He wouldn't see it like that
You should know how things go
by now
I'll just have to stay on the road.
It's easier
What about all that work and the
training? It'll all be wasted
Forget it
At least we can still eat
Our luck will soon change,
you'll see
What's wrong?
Are you ill?
This is terrible
Wait here! I'll go and buy
some medicine
- Someone to see you
- Who is it?
She says it's about Mr Terajima
Did you say Terajima?
It's Otoku!
How is Kikunosuke?
Is he here too?
I've come about him
Please, come in
It's been hard, then?
The hard times have
helped his art
Even I can see how much he's
developed and improved
It's obvious that no matter
how good one is...
...it doesn't count if you don't
carry a great family name
Please, won't you help him
get back to Tokyo?
He'll get worse if he keeps going
as he is now
He desperately needs help now.
Please help him
I beg you
We've had news of him
Father and I have tried to speak
to master on Kiku's behalf
But master kept saying Kiku was
useless and no good as an actor
You see, Kiku made master
lose face
What about giving him a part
in our play?
If he's really good, I'm sure master
will reconsider and relent
Please, father
Which part could he play?
He could do Sumizome,
replacing me
That's crazy
After his low-grade work
with the travelling troupe...
...he could never tackle
such a big role
The public would never accept it
- Don't you agree, young master?
- I do
But if you let him...
If you and young master give your
permission, I'm sure he will manage
Please give him a chance
- Please, young master!
- Fuku!
Yes, I agree
- You agree?
- Yes, I do
Thank you
Look, lady, if he does well...
...I'll go and talk to his father
myself
I'll try to persuade him
to take Kiku back
That's what you want for him too,
isn't it?
Yes, more than anything
in the world
If he's still no good, there's
nothing I can do for him
But, lady, if he is good... will you
give him back to the family?
Otoku-san
This is a very hard thing
I have to demand of you
You mean, we have to part?
Yes, I'm prepared to do that
Stop here!
Kikunosuke, wake up
Kiku-chan
Fuku-chan
- You did that?
- Kiku-chan...
We have a lot to catch up, but
I want you to come with me now
Who is this woman?
How did she get here?
Where did  you come from?
I come from Shimoku-machi
Who are you?
What is  your name?
Sumizome is my name
Sumizome?
They named you after this
cherry blossom?
A fine name
This is a game
We both know that
Truth...
And lies
Play on charm
With hidden intention
If that is so...
...we must part here
- You really amazed me
- Thank you
- You did very well
- With your help
Kiku-chan, that was very good,
you were excellent
- You did very well
- Really?
- I'm sure your father will be pleased
- Thank you
Thank you, uncle
I'm so happy. It was an
excellent performance
Fuku-chan, this is all due to your
kindness. I'll never forget it
No, it's all due to your hard work
and training
Go on, take off your wig now
Now you can go back to Tokyo
in great style
It will be wonderful news
for your father
Every boy should be sent
on such a hard journey
Otoku!
We can go home!
Really?
And I want to go home, as
you'll be coming with me
It's hard to believe, isn't it?
I never dreamed this would happen
It's true
My honour is vindicated
I worked hard so I could go back
to Tokyo...
...but I never thought I'd have
so much praise
I knew it
I knew you'd be good today,
I never doubted it
I knew you would amaze them all
And they were amazed
This is the reward for
all your hardship
It's been such a long, hard journey
Hasn't it?
Even so...
...I was so anxious I couldn't
bear to watch you perform
I just stood under the stage
the whole time...
...and prayed
Funny, isn't it?
So now you really are happy
All is well, then
You can go back to Tokyo
with your head held high
Are you well?
I'm happy and so relieved
Let's celebrate
Excuse me!
I want to order a real feast for two
With all the trimmings
Everything must be fresh
- And plenty of sake!
- Is that all?
Are  you sure we can afford all that?
We musn't be extravagant,
you know
Sir, this came for you
Of course we can afford it,
because we're so happy
You can be your old selfish self
again
I ordered this for you
You can't go to Tokyo
dressed like that
Well, do you like it?
It suits you
Such a pretty pattern
Start sewing it now. It must be
finished by our last performance
You must get ready
You'll be leaving soon
You're right
I'll go now
I'll thank them and come right back
There, Otoku, we'll start our
celebration together then
Don't worry
I'll be right back
Take care
Otoku's gone!
- Where's Otoku?
- She was there just now
Kiku-chan!
She's left this letter for you
Was it you, Fuku-chan?
You  told her to leave me
You tricked me, saying
we were going together
It was me, Kiku-chan.
I told her to let you go
Why, young master?
Why did you do that?
Just sit down and listen
She'd already made up her mind
We both wanted you back in Tokyo
And now that you've
proved yourself...
...your father will take you back
But not if you are with Otoku
- That is my business
- But, Kiku-chan
But what?
You don't know how Otoku
really feels about it
- Don't I?
- You don't
Stop this!
Kikunosuke is probably right
You have the wrong idea
about our relationship
I can never be happy if I have to
go to Tokyo without Otoku
Listen, Kiku-chan!
You've been through a lot
But on your own, you'll always
be stuck at the bottom
As Otoku said: a family name is
very important in the theatre
Under the name of Kikugoro,
you will shine in Tokyo
If you want to succeed, you must
accept the demands of your public
Without her, success means
nothing
I want to be with her always
I'll keep looking until I find her
Listen to me
Think of how Otoku must feel
What about her?
The hard life on the road
has drained her strength
Now that my luck has changed,
I want to give her a good life
Listen, Kikunosuke
You must obey her wishes
Otoku wants you to go to Tokyo
and excel in your art
It's what she wants. That would
give her the greatest happiness
Don't go looking for her
I'm not asking you to do it for us
Do it for Otoku
Fuku-chan
Why would she want it that way?
For five long years we lived through
such hardship and suffering
Her love and kindness always
soothed my pain away
I could go through anything
with her
Oh, foolish Otoku
Why have you gone?
Where are you now?
Otsuru!
Uncle
Who is there?
Sister!
It's you , sister
I'll get a light
We didn't know where you were,
you never wrote
It's good to see that you are well
Where's Kikunosuke?
We had to part
You have parted?
Why?
I didn't enjoy living with him
any more
You have changed so much.
You look different
Really?
Yes, I must have changed
It's the first time for six years
that I've seen you happy
Even the air feels fresher,
and I feel lighter
Uncle playing the lion king
with Fukusuke as the cub
That's what Kiku wanted
- I'm relying on you
- And I rely on you
Morita-san
After we finish our run here,
how about going to Osaka?
- Do you really think so?
- Yes. Don't you think it's a good idea?
Well, try it
Kikunosuke is very popular there, and
having succeeded here...
why not succeed not in Osaka?
Good idea. I'm Sure that Kikunosuke 
will also think so.
Why not close the deal before we
change our minds?
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely!
It's decided then
How you've grown!
Who are you?
Don't you know me?
No!
No wonder
Is that an offering?
Yes, New Year is over
Kikunosuke, what are you doing
here? They're all waiting for you
I pushed my cub...
...from the top of the mountain
He went through trials and
tribulations to test his strength
He has no experience...
...but having gone through
much hardship...
...we are together again
The plants celebrate
the two lions' reunion
No matter what you say
We never gave up hope
What a happy outcome
Look!
They are carrying a lantern
with your name on it
You know Osaka very well
Will you show us the town
between shows?
Kikunosuke!
Osaka is your second home
So you should be at the front of
the boat parade today
You'll stand on your own at the front
and greet your public
- Where are you going?
- I must see Kikunosuke
I have some business with him
Let him come
I know Kikunosuke personally
Kiku-chan!
Why, you've become so fine!
It's been so long. You did
so much for me
- But Otoku...
- That's why I am here
She's staying with us
She's at your place?
She's not at all well
It's been getting worse since
the start of the rainy season
She wouldn't let us
tell you about her
But the doctor says
she might die tonight
So I had to come and tell you
I know there have been many
problems between you...
...but you must come with me
to see her now
But...
Come and see her
before it's too late
Kiku...
...go and see your wife!
An actor can't achieve his art
by talent and hard work alone
Skill is not enough
Otoku helped you,
not sparing herself
If it hadn't been for her, you
wouldn't be where you are now
I want you to go to her now
And thank her for me,
as your father
Father
Go now! You can join us later
It's very bad. You must inform
her relatives as soon as possible
- Father's already gone to tell them
- I see
Call me if she gets worse
I'll come at once
Thank you so much
Stop here
Father!
Otoku-san, Kikunosuke is here.
He has come to see you
Why did you tell him?
I told you not to.
I had to.
We were not supposed to meet
ever again
Please go away
Please, sir, leave this place
Don't worry, Otoku, it's all right
I have father's permission
Your father?
Yes, he said I should go
and see my wife...
...and thank you on his behalf for
making you the artist I am today
Did he say that?
Otoku, I'm in Osaka for a short
season. I made a triumphant return
Now that we are together,
my life is fulfilled...
...as well as my art
Did your father really
give his permission?
We can finally get married
We can go out into the world
as husband and wife
That's right
My husband
Now...
...you should go.
They will be about to begin
- Don't lose any more time.
- Calm yourself, it's not important
- They can have it without me.
- No, your public expects you
The parade makes no sense without you
Please, you should go to the parade
When it's over we'll
have lots of time
Unless you have someone
else expecting you
- There is no one else. Right, Otosha?
- Of course not
- My love.
- What?
I will listen the music from here and
imagine you parading and greeting...
- ...your public.
- But I want to stay here with you.
If I am your wife, and all at last 
accept me as such...
if I have this honor, then...
...you should do what I ask of you.
And I want you to go
- I will go if that is you want.
- I will be here, waiting for you.
- Return to me when you finish the parade.
- I will return
My love, I am so proud
of your success
- it's all because of you.
- Hurry, you mustn't lose any more time.
I will wait for you here and imagine you
parading beside the river...
...amid the applause of your public. I've never
been so happy as I am now
My love...
They'll see the parade, and the
whole world will know your worth
They'll see and parade by in
the name of our love
Yes
You are the best actor in the world and
I the happiest woman in the land...
Thanks to you
Wait for me, Otoku,
wait for me
I love you
- Otosha.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Will she be all right?
I couldn't do anything for
her before
and now that I can...
Otoku, don't die!
You mustn't die!
Uncle...
Go and have a look at
the boat parade
I want you to tell me all about it
Please, hurry!
Yes, I'm going
Sister, the medicine
Sister!
