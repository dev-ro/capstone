'The world drifted away
into many continents'
'The continents were
divided into countries'
'Countries were split into many states'
'In 2014, Telangana detached itself
from Andhra Pradesh...'
'...as an independent state'
'Since Hyderabad was
part of Telangana...'
'...it was decided to announce'
'...Visakhapatnam as capital
of Andhra Pradesh'
'But since law and order was disrupted...'
'...and since commissioner Ramakrishnan
who came to rectify it was murdered'
'...Amaravathi became
the de facto seat of governance'
'Till date because the motive behind
that murder has not been ascertained'
'...all hell broke loose
in Andhra Pradesh'
Silence!
Now the Home Minister
can record his statement
Hon'ble Chief minister and I
have taken a joint decision
If this Assembly agrees...
...within 2 months, we can nab
the culprit who killed the commissioner
And the motive behind it
I can assure you
First disclose your decision
We have spoken to Mr Ramanathan
Home minister of Tamil Nadu
He has agreed to send an efficient
police officer to our State
Don't we have efficient
police officers in our State?
Of course we do
But they haven't divulged
anything for a year
So what?
Like our Vizag, in the port cities
of Chennai and Tuticorin...
...with many badges
pinned to his credit
...he went up to South Africa and
arrested an international criminal
We are bringing in here
the most powerful police officer
Who is he?
Duraisingam
"The solitary lion"
"Here comes the lion
The 1 man battalion"
'You might have seen a lion
in a photo, movie or TV'
'You may have even seen
a lion locked up in a cage'
'Have you seen it stride
in the forest with pride?'
'Have you seen it hunt its prey
with a barbaric vengeance?'
'It weighs one ton
when it strikes you'
'Do you want to see its power?'
'Witness it right now'
"The hunter-lion"
'From one city to another,
country or continent...
'...I will pursue my target
with a fixed aim relentlessly'
I'll make sure
you get death penalty
But our law doesn't permit bringing in
a police officer from another State
So we plan to transfer this case
to Central Bureau of Investigation
And bring him to
our State through CBI
He will investigate
the commissioner's murder
And also allot the responsibility
of restoring law and order in Vizag
I got Duraisingam's number
Give it to me
Isn't this Duraisingam?
Don't come to Andhra
If you step into
Vizag police station...
...I'll chop your legs!
What did he say?
'I was in a tearing hurry
I didn't get a haircut'
'Come and do the needful' he said
Not just his legs
Chop his neck too!
"Come and get 'em
Beat them numb"
"Come and detect
Come to protect"
"Assail and assault
Have a bloody blast"
"The lion stalks its prey
Duraisingam is on his way"
"Prowls night and day"
"Lion with momentum
He is Duraisingam"
"Roars fearsome"
"Strike to seal his fate"
"Show them your power innate"
Chop that Madrasi's legs
"Enraged 1-man army
Eliminates his enemy"
"Patrols to the T, his territory"
"The lion, king of the jungle
Duraisingam on a mission possible"
I am not a Madrasi!
Indian!!
Who called me?
Who segregated Tamil Nadu police
from Andhra police?
Tamil Nadu, Andhra,
Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala
...have been divided
as States for convenience
Not as different nations
I am an Indian police!
Sir, autograph please
Look here, the deputy commissioner
who is arriving today...
...has stripped many rowdies
of their trousers in Tamil Nadu
If any of you mess up anything-
Will he remove their caps, sir?
Or their belts, sir?
Who are you?
Don't block the way
I would like your autograph, sir
You are-
I asked you for your autograph
at the railway station but you left-
I thought it was just for fun
You're serious about it
What will you do
with my autograph?
No police officer has the guts to
trample 10 rowdies in a public place
Durai-singam
- Girls shouldn't come to police stations
- What about your house then, sir?
I don't like anyone
speaking out of turn
Ask him if it's alright to
stand in a corner and talk
I was told you are a strict officer
But I heard you hit 12 men
and sent them to a hospital
I never knew you had
such stamina!
Did you find out about them
and why they attacked me?
I enquired after thrashing them, sir
But their excuse is very cheap, sir
- What?
- You were wearing a blue shirt it seems
They didn't like it one bit
That's why they hit yo-
They took an aversion
to my blue shirt?!
Release them immediately
We've filed a report, sir
Yov! Just tear that report, man
- 'Tear it, huh? '
- You said he has was strict
He is walking away
with such loose talk
This file has all the details
of the commissioner's murder case
Am I here to investigate
the commissioner's murder?
I thought I can enjoy 'Avakkai biriyani'
and relax for a couple of months
Overloading me
with work on my 1st day
He has been appointed
by CBI to assist you
Let this remain confidential for a while
That file shouldn't
budge an inch from there
But I want all the details
from it on to my laptop
I want details of all officers here
Their character, service records in 2 days
When I was on the train
this morning some chap called me
From True Caller I found out
he is Beemli Selva
Sir, he is part of Reddy's gang
'Madhusudhana Reddy'
'A businessman who has Vizag city and port
under his control through fear and force'
'VIP and don'
'Supporter of Ramprasad,
minister of central civil aviation'
'Without Reddy's consent, a container
can neither enter nor exit Vizag port
'Reddy embraces those
who endorse his actions'
'Destroys those who defy him'
'This is Reddy's character'
Are you brainless or what?
You've assaulted a policeman
He has come to investigate
the commissioner's murder case
You've needled him unnecessarily
What will you do if he arrests you
for the commissioner's murder?
If you wrestle with a police officer
you should come out the winner
Clear out!
Call Vittal sir now
Yes, Reddy
'His father Ram Prasad is
the minister for Central Aviation'
'His mother Rebecca
is a British woman'
Steve and his wife
are waiting in the office, sir
'He imports all iron scraps in Australia
to his 4 steel plants in India'
'...for export and import
the Australian Govt has conferred
...the honorary post
of High commissioner'
Director of CBI is a close
friend of mine, I'll take care
Where is constable Veera?
Gone to nab Thangam
the 'Loan shark'
She is a rowdy female, I say
Akka, you're in a league of your own!
He has gone in disguise, sir
"Thangam, my precious dear
I came looking for you here"
(song from 'Naanum Rowdy Dhaan')
"My diamond sparkler new
One day I shall take­you"
Sis, he's flirting with you
"Her face–oh my God!"
"Her shape–wow, good Lord!!"
"In toto
Aiyaiyaiyo!"
"You mesmerize me on the whole
Body, mind, heart and soul"
Why did you drag me here?
My sister who was averse to marriage
has fallen flat for you, da
Love, oh God!
"Who is he, I wonder?
Why is he here, I ponder?"
"He smiles at me, he appreciates
I am the center of his universe
"What is this heavenly feeling?
I don't know, I'm still reeling"
Just because I sang this song
did you think 'I am also a rowdy'?
I am a police officer
I have come to arrest you
You can be a cop
or a foolish chap
I am in love with you
Lord Rama, help me!
First marry me
Then arrest me
After that attack me
Aiyo! I am just a youngster
But you look like
a smooth operator!
I am as thin as a beanpole
But you sing like a nightingale
My sister is a chaste maiden!
Get lost, you son of a gu-
Swine!
Only because you're a beanpole and
a nightingale, my sister flipped for you
If your sister liked my song...
...the original singer is Anirudh, man
He is thinner than me
and extremely stylish
Kidnap him and get him
married to your sister
Tata, my dear nincompoops!
Which inspector dealt with
the commissioner's murder case?
Me, sir
Why haven't you recovered
the mobile he used last?
I couldn't find it
in the crime scene, sir
I enquired in the neighborhood
But I couldn't find it, sir
Serve them tea
The new DC is inside, sir
New, right?
Duraisingam, sir
What a surprise, sir?
- Do you know sir earlier?
- What kind of question is that?!
"A lion with momentum
He is Duraisingam"
My home town is Tuticorin, sir
You ensured Thangaraj
got death penalty
You made Bhai and Danny the drug lord
stir porridge in the pans in prison, sir
I know everything, sir
Sir, how is your wife?
He has no family
- What?
- He isn't even married
Srinivas, I was very much
in town on his wedding day
I have all the cuttings
of his wedding snaps
Want to see?
Shall I show you?
- Constable
- Oh God!
Er...er, has your wife
come with you, sir?
- No
- Why, sir?
- Not with me now
- Why, sir?
We got divorced
I don't believe this!
Come inside
We can catch up-
We can go in and continue
I am Veeram, sir
I leave the forum, sir
I want to meet asst commissioner
Krishnaraj who attended the case
He is on medical leave, sir
But he'll be in Royal Casino
every night to booze, sir
Do you know for a fact?
Why get worked up for this?
Don't I have to show
I'm working now that I'm here?
Where is Royal Casino bar?
Let's go take a look
Sir, asst commissioner is inside
"He's a smooth operator double quick"
"With one look, he lures this chick"
"With rainbow colors graphic
he weaves mischievous magic"
"His caress shoots pulse rate erratic"
"Kills with his pinches rhapsodic"
If you want you can
see the network report
Haven't you seen it as yet?
"Everybody hello"
"Move it like a rolla"
"Singam dude in the tick of a second
stepped in here, this lion legend"
"Never mess in with him"
"He be rolling you all"
"International dabber"
"Swing in with him
Song a with him"
"Fast by himself supersonic"
"As good as gold, supersonic"
"Get them on the floor"
"Come, doe dear, I'm your energy tonic"
"24 carat gold supersonic"
"When you gotta move"
"I'll feast on you, I'm really unique"
"Try hindering me with a hurdle
I'll quick fix whatever the obstacle"
"To ignite instantaneous
I'm a brave heart with legal access"
"If taxed with terabytes of tension
I'll be a holy terror to reckon"
"Take a look at me once more
I have faces on sides four"
"As good as gold, supersonic"
"Come, dear deer, I'm your energy tonic"
"24 carat gold supersonic"
"I'll feast on you,
I'm really unique"
"Even if theft and night time
join hands as partners in crime"
"Neurons in my brain send impulses
to search for missing pieces"
"Even if midnight and burglary
aide and abet as accessory"
"Neurons in my brain send impulses
to dig deeper in the trenches"
"Will you sing with me?"
"I'll dance in a frenzy"
"Will you sing with me?"
"I'll dance in a frenzy"
"Job becomes a jolly commission
when profession is passion"
"As good as gold"
"24 carat gold"
"As good as gold supersonic"
"Come, doe dear, I'm your energy tonic"
"24 carat gold supersonic"
"I'll feast on you, I'm really unique"
"Corner of my eyes zoom in"
"Eyes clash exchanging"
"Here and there circling"
"Only you, my eyes will zero in
To revel in ultra scanning"
"Whenever she flees wherever
my GPS will flare and flicker"
"My limbs with strong reflex
if you provoke I will attack"
"No need clubs or unions
I am equal to a 1000 lions"
"If you're caught in my jungle
hey! hey! hey trouble!"
"Good as gold"
"Lo and behold"
"As good as gold, supersonic"
"Come, my dear deer, I'm your energy tonic"
"24 carat gold supersonic"
"I'll feast on you, I'm really unique"
"Try hindering me with a hurdle
I'll quick fix whatever the obstacle"
"To ignite instantaneous
I'm a brave heart with legal access"
"If taxed with terabytes of tension
I'll be a holy terror to reckon"
"Take a look at me once more
I have faces on sides four"
"Hey! As good as gold
This lion, behold!"
"Hey! Pure as 24 carat gold
Roars in his stronghold"
"Look at this lion in its den
with its mane honeyed golden"
"King of the jungle, hey!
Lord of all he surveys"
If I danced along
just to give him company...
...with no respect,
he made me tend to this horse
- Sir?
- This is respect
Aren't you commissioner Veera Babu?
Me...commissioner?
Commissioner
Long live!
Commissioner
Long live!
I'm not the big C
you make me out to be!
- Joint commissioner
- No
- Assistant commissioner?
- Nope
- Deputy?
- Ordinary police constable
That's okay
What do you want?
- I came to meet Dorai
- Which Durai?
DC Duraisingam
works here, right?
Addressing him without respect?
How dare you treat
my boss with scant respect?
That's how we talk
Sir, your friend has come
Who said she is his friend?
Got his autograph, right?
We bonded then
- Does that make him your friend?
- Yes
If I click a snap with him,
then a 'closssse' friend!
- Why do you keep coming here?
- Then when should I come where, sir?
What do you want?
I like bold police officers
like you very much
That's why I befriended you
This friendship won't work
- I'm already married
- But aren't you a divorcee?
Hey! Who told you all this?
Shouldn't be a traitor to men
Shouldn't trade women
My grandfather's words of wisdom
I'll clobber you
Is this how a young girl talks?
Yov! Buffalo, will you bring her in
if she claims to be a friend?
Men won't be truthful
Women won't be deceitful
My grandma's wise words
Where's your grandma?
Grandmaaaaaa!
He's feeling shy to call me
his friend in front of everyone
But shyness, fear, bashfulness,
shame, timidity, modesty
...are all alien to me
Even I don't have
whatever you listed now
Bingo!
On the way
drop me at the court
Tell me
2 check leaves I signed
are missing from my office
I didn't specify the amount
Blank checks
Isn't it wrong to sign them?
I know
First inform the bank
to block the checks
Call everyone in
their office and enquire
But before that...
...ask them to
search thoroughly
This doesn't seem
like a missing case
More like it was
deliberately displaced
Sir, a complaint has been
lodged against the shops here
It seems they mix cocaine in coffee
They add 'snow' in ice cream
Let's taste both
to be doubly sure
- Veeram, where's your sir?
- In CMR mall
Our Abhi is missing
Reddy's henchman is
carrying a girl over there
My daughter
My child...stop!
Where are you taking her?
Wait, I say
If you're a Customs officer...
...do you have 4 arms?
You got hold of our container
and refused to let go
Better sign this paper now
- Wait here
- I can't sign
Give my child back
Knowing it's Reddy's stuff
you still confiscated it?
Sign the papers
Who are you, sir?
Being a police officer
you're supporting a goon?
No one in Vizag has the right
to block Reddy's container
Oh gawd!
Abhi...?
What's happening here?
I won't sign until I know
what is inside that container
- You won't sign, huh?
-  I won't, da
If you don't sign now...
...shall I tell him to lower his hand
a few inches below her neck?
"A lion gathering momentum
He is Duraisingam"
I was talking, right?
Molesting a woman?!
Isn't it a disgusting habit?
Besides your mother,
sister and wife...
...will you see all other women
only in a lecherous way?
Go
Leave now
Don't let him go
You dare hit a policeman?
What audacity!
If you let go of
4 containers now...
...we can seize 400 containers
Containers have left?
He got the signatures?!
Start the car
Hey! Ask that DC to meet me
Jalaripeta,Gun Ravi's area
Can't take any action
without defying him
Mr Reddy has come to meet you, sir
- Ask him to come
- You have to go and meet him
I don't understand
Reddy has never stepped
into any police station
Only the officers
will go and meet him
Tell him I can't come
DC said he can't come, Reddy
Start the car
- This is DC Duraisingam
- Tell me
I hope you'll understand
if I say just one word
No one should know
I'm on your side
That's why I didn't
come out to see you
I understand
You should come home one day
Certainly
The day we both meet...
...I can assure you will be
a memorable day in your life!
- I don't understand
- Maybe your birthday
Or your wedding day
Not a single soul in the station
What are you eating?
- Brown nut ball
- Eat
Isn't that a groundnut ball?
This is groundnut ball and
this is its brother brown nut ball
Taking me for a royal ride
early in the morning?
You look like a cylinder
wearing pants!
Mocking a senior officer!
What is the problem, sir?
A groundnut ball
is brown nut ball it seems
He's being sarcastic!
That's why I whacked him
Try this 'Vimala' orange
Yov! Isn't this pomelo orange?
This is the non-hybrid pomelo orange
That is its sister 'Vimala' orange
Then what about this?
Their mother 'Amala' orange, huh?
Is this their grandma
'Pamila' orange?
- Yes, bro
- Don't you know?
Ignorance is bliss for me
You claim to be the brainbox?!
Will you call your brother 'akka'
and sister as uncle?!
Sir, forensic report
In the ballistic investigation...
...bullet in the commissioner's body was
from an improvised country made gun
Are locally made
weapons in use here?
Ravi from Jalaripeta
deals with this, sir
Sir, Vidya is coming in
Looks like she may be
in love with you
I came only to see you, sir
What-
Sitting near me like this
in a public place
Then can I sit close to you
in a private place, sir?
Get up
GET UP!
- I want to talk to you in private
- Tell me whatever it is right here
I think I have-
- You have?
- Love
- I'm NOT in love with you
- No, huh?
Vidya, how could you say this?
You followed him as if you had
fallen in love with him
Shameless!
First clear out from here
Where, sir?
Check where the restroom is
Let me confess the whole truth, sir
This is my preliminary
pass certificate
This is my main hall ticket
And this is my ID card
I'm preparing for
the Indian Police Service exam
I followed you thinking
I can learn something
Please settle the account
Why didn't you show your ID card
when you got his autograph?
Will your sir accept it at once?
Girls shouldn't come to the railway station
Radio station is taboo for mothers
Grandmothers can't step into fire stations
Won't he set his own set of rules?
I want to see you immediately
I'm right here
- Here...?
- Our company's guest room
- Where's the rest room?
- Look over there
I asked you directions for the rest room
and you're showing me the toilet
What...what?
I can even see bathrooms everywhere
But I am unable to see
any rest room here
Room for pigs!
They have a separate room for pigs!
The other day in
the police station-
I lied to you about
that missing check
I know
I felt like seeing you
I needed an excuse, right?
'For a guy to meet a girl...'
'...didn't you say
he needs an excuse?'
He went into 406, sir
What are you doing here?
Let me ask you
the same question
I went to the restroom
Rest room?!
I was looking for that wretched
rest room in all the floors
Show me where you took rest
I want to see the rest room
My boss also wants
to take rest there
- Do you know what a restroom is?
- What...?
You mean where people poop?
Sir, I came looking for yo-
Wrong, sir
To meet a girl who complained secretly-
Not right, sir
Do you know who she is?
My wife
You said you were a divorcee?
Bless you, my dear
Welcome, sir
"At last I see you're mine"
"It­s like I­ve been lifted high"
"My dreams have been brought to life"
"Girl, the first time I set eyes on you"
"At once I lost myself in your love true"
"Only one I asked you, just once'
"I welded you to my soul, my princess"
"Beloved, you are I know"
"Like mother­s unconditional love"
"Like a sleepless baby somehow"
"Like the ghost Casper, friendly fellow
my love, with your love you follow"
"Hot tempered and stubborn I was
not to fall in love at all, o­lass"
"With your expressive eyes you hooked me
My vow tore into tatters, tigress sweety"
"1st time I set eyes on you, on that day"
"I gave myself to you right away"
"Only one I asked you just once"
"I fused you to my heart, my princess"
"Bright yellow flower, my love-goddess
Step out of your petal into my universe"
"Holding your waist, sweet parakeet,
Come, let me sweep you off your feet"
"If you call me,
I'll go with you readily"
"On a bed of thorns or the silver sky
I'll walk beside you, I'll comply"
"Not sulking if you didn't see me"
"You won my love with your loyalty"
"What mistake shall I do happily
for you to yell at me daily?"
"During the day, not seeing you
craving climbs a ladder feeling blue"
"I want our nights together
with don't disturb sign forever"
"Only after you breezed into my life
my days are filled with sugar & spice"
"To pamper your desires to the T
my passion crosses its boundary"
"With your hand linked in mine naturally
Planning the day's agenda casually"
"To make out with a fervor
To whet appetites for each other"
"I am a policeman, that's true
I'm here now to loot you"
"Love, the first time I set eyes on you"
"I accepted you as my address anew"
"Only one I asked you just once"
"I linked you in my mind, my princess"
When you are newly married...
...I feel bad to send you to a city
that's going through trouble and turmoil
If our neighboring State
is asking us to help...
...it is a feather in the cap
of Tamil Nadu police, sir
If possible ask for a North Indian...
...who doesn't know the language
to be appointed as commissioner, sir
If I take you along with me
to a city churning in chaos
...I may have to work
under a cloud of worry
Just 2 months
You should go
Godspeed
Then you can stay with
your parents these 2 months
Maybe you can work
in your dad's office
I've got an idea
Instead of Chennai office...
...let me stay in the guesthouse
and work in our factory in Vizag
I won't meet you or call you
Even if I meet you
I won't identify myself
I'll have the pleasure
of being in the same city with you
Okay
I was very particular no one should
know about my family background
Even for security purposes
...my wife who refused to
remove her wedding chain
...I was forced to say
I had divorced her
My wife is the one who is great
Head constable has fainted
- Come soon
- What happened?
I want to know
what happened
He complained of
a headache, sir
I got him a glass of tea
and tablet, sir
He drank it and fainted
How can you treat him here?
First take him to
a hospital...fast
- Take care
- Govind, be with him
What tablet did he take?
Here, sir
Look this up in Google
The expiry date has been struck off
Sir, this is an Australian tablet
How can that be sold...
...in some corner tea stall
Find out the tablet's source
The supplier and all the details
And let me know
Do a mild enquiry
Go in mufti
Who is supplying
this medicine to you?
Yes, Srinivas
Baburao from Anakapalle
has supplied it, sir
Find out how he got
this tablet in particular
Sir, no proper office or license
He is supplying
from a go-down, sir
Did you find out
who the supplier is?
His name is Prabhakar
Reddy's man, sir
Don't enquire further
- What happened?
- Murder case
He said he would be back
after attending to it
Yes, Krishnaraj
Someone has murdered
MLA Malleswar Rao, sir
But he never came back
Krishnaraj claims
he never called that day
He has come to meet
the commissioner thrice
Do you recognize him?
So many people
meet him in his office
How will I know all of them?
Come here, dear
No...wait
Go inside
Don't stand here
Why are you calling my children?
No need, stop all this
I don't want anything
My dead husband
won't walk in now
Why are you reacting like this?
That assistant commissioner
came here to enquire
He asked a few questions
for the sake of asking
Pretended to feel sad
and made a pass at my girls
Won't a mother know if he was being
sympathetic or lecherous?
As soon as my kids finish school
we will leave this place
I don't want any of you knocking at
my door in your khaki uniform please
Commissioner's wife is lying, sir
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir
Krishnaraj never called
the commissioner at all
We have copies of both their bills
Not registered in either, sir
Krishnaraj was insistent
we should check the reports
The report favors his statement
That's why I suspect him even more
When I asked his wife a question
she looked at me with a flash of anger
It was loaded with honesty
I believe in emotions
rather than evidence
They have used their clout
to tamper network reports
Is that possible, sir?
In recent years, with the help of
reports from network companies
...we have been investigating
Why can't they go wrong?
But the top level
has to permit this, sir
Why won't the top level agree?
A company that earns 100 billion
They hold meetings to discuss
how they can increase their turnover
Reducing their profit...
...do they reduce their call charges
to their customers by 50%?
Let us not blame anyone
But we can suspect someone?
Sir, he hacked UBC bank's system
and stole Rs 1,800,000
They have morphed girls' photos
and sent them through WhatsAp-
- Send them away
- They should be attacked by animals
Will you shut your gob?
You can be used instead!
He hacked Cel Tel network's server and-
What did you do?
They billed me wrongly
for Rs 2000  instead of Rs 200
My attempts to plead and
persuade them were futile
So he hacked their network
4 million customers
were billed only 2 bucks
The company suffered a huge loss
Soooper, man
Claiming he is linked to
the commissioner's murder
...take him under our custody
You there! Wait
What crime did you commit?
We gave connection
to aunties online
- Gas connection?
- No
- Cable connection?
- No
- Current connection?
- NO
- Water connection?
- 'Matter' connection!
What do you mean?
Aunties bouncing with drive
for uncles bugged with life
Aunties with a love-spark
for uncles who are dark
Girls who are freaky
for guys who are free
We connected unlike poles to attract
'Positive Individual Making-out Progress'
in a multi-level indeed
If you help us
in this investigation
...you can be out
within 2 months-
What should I do?
At 10:15 a call was made from
the asst commissioner's phone...
...to the commissioner
for 31 seconds
It has been erased from
the network 12 hours later
At 11:15 commissioner's signal
was at the crime spot, right?
Madurawada Towers
SE 620.10 meters
At that particular time at the crime spot
can you check for any other signal?
Only one number has flashed
from a distance of 300 meters
Neared at 11:12 and left at 11:16
Sustained for 4 minutes
In the name of Mallaya
Is Mallaya the murderer-
According to forensic reports
4 people are involved in this murder
Like how Krishnaraj's number
was erased from the call list
...can't other numbers be erased
from the location history?
Can it be retrieved?
That chap Selva who tried
a face-off the day I joined duty
- Shall we taunt him face to face?
- Will do, sir
Hey netizen!
From this number some female
has texted me, 'I love you'
I tried calling her back 70-80 times
She didn't pick my call
Can you find out her name,
the city she resides in-
You stuck the paper under my nose
before I could furnish all the details
Pushpa from Vijayawada
DOB 7th November 1994
Parents are Krishna and Shanthi
Wait, man
She sent this to 2400 numbers
They have all called her
70-80 times daily
180000 'missed' calls to that number
- So many?
- 12 people are paying her phone bill
Those 12 numbers are
boys 20-25 years old
Daily one number from Delhi
From Delhi?
This list seems to extend
up to North India
In the midst of traditional
home bound wives...
...what a bimbo
with loose morals!
Hello, sir
Come in, sir
Vidya, sir is entering Zoom bar
Come if you can, to meet your star!
I'll be there
in 4 minutes flat
What would you like to order, sir?
You haven't taken
the IPS exam as yet
Trying to sweeten up sir
with your salute?
I need your signature
in this application, sir
- What is it?
- I intend learning to shoot
The Training academy wants
an attestation from a police officer
Girls shouldn't be here
Sir, Selva has come
Go, leave now
- Good afternoon, sir
- Sit down
Have a beer
Regarding the murder of
the commissioner a year ago
I know you are
in no way connected
But you know the man
connected with the murder
Why are you linking me to this
when I am least connected?
Without anyone's knowledge...
...whisper in my ear
You know I am
one of Reddy's men?
I am also on his side
Why do you bring him into this?
Playing politics with me?
Tamil Nadu police cannot
do any damn thing here
Bloody mongrel
You think you're worthy enough
to talk about Tamil Nadu police?
This gun does not discern its target
based on which state or what status
Only what is right and wrong
Shall I shoot you?
Shall I?
I could have closed the file on you
for trying to kill me the day I joined duty
What are you staring blankly for?
It was you, right?
Didn't you send your thugs that day?
You told them my blue shirt was
an excuse for you to target me
We will pretend we don't know
even if we were well aware
And you'll keep thinking you fooled us?
He must have killed the commissioner
You'll get evidence in his house
What do you want, sir?
You are barging in to my house?
Sir, how can you come-
- Look in that rice bin
- Yes, sir
Don't! That's an offering for God
There is nothing in there
Entire stash is Australian dollars
Worth almost 700 to 800 million
Who are you, man?
Gun in the rice bin
A trunk filled with
Australian currency
How did all this-
Duraisingam, do not enquire
about that money or the gun
That is 'hawala' money
from Australia
If you want, take a couple of bundles
I'll take it, Reddy
When I need it
I'll do the needful
Let's go
Hey! Take a bundle of Australian dollar
Get a cup of coffee for each one of them
Duraisingam barged into Selva's house
without knowing he is one of our men
We can trust him
By the way
how did you find out?
4 cameras belonging to my company
monitoring Vizag city are active, right?
Then money must be
dispatched from here
Something doesn't fit right
Srinivas, something has been
written about our boss
Read it
- What is it?
- You are closely associated with Reddy
It seems you accept
bribes from him
Vizag city has deteriorated
after your deputation
Not only that, sir
In room # 406...er-
...you were seen with a girl
Who the hell wrote that?
Someone called Agni
If we nab Agni and beat him up
we can get to the bottom of this, sir
- Yov! Go, do it
- No, don't
Only what seemed true
has been written
As soon as we knew a police officer
was coming from Tamil Nadu
...to write a thrilling article about him
...our chief editor from Hyderabad
sent her here to investigate
Her work should
be kept a secret
At first I thought he must be
a skirt chaser and I spoke differently
But he's very strict
So I lied saying
I am taking the IPS exam
He believed me at once
'A complaint has been lodged
against CBI officer Duraisingam'
What do you mean, sir?
Please come to Vizag immediately
In my next article
these photos will be published
Then this man will
scurry back to Tamil Nadu
I heard about the article
I'm going to my hometown
Your reputation must be
damaged by now
If you want to cover up
arrest 10 of my men
I'll arrest, Reddy
I will
Why is she coming here
now of all times?
Sir, I have come to Vizag
to meet you
Come immediately to
Home minister's guest house
Tell Subbu to send Mallaya's details
Come here
Don't come this side hereafter
Someone has maligned me
If you come here...
...your reputation
will be in shreds too
Duraisingam, what is happening here?
I am unable to digest
whatever he told me
No development whatsoever
in the commissioner's murder case
You've not arrested
even one culprit so far
Just arresting a culprit
doesn't make one a police officer
A smart cop should prevent crimes
The constable and sub inspector here
can arrest if that's what you want
Why should I come here
from Tamil Nadu, sir?
- I don't follow
- My route is different, sir
Only now I have scattered the puffed rice
for the fishes in the sea to take the bait
Very soon I'll hook them
The day will soon dawn for me to expose
the 4th lion in the police symbol
You won't find a single criminal
in the city on that day
I understand, Duraisingam
In another week,
I'll complete my task
I'll arrest all those involved
in the commissioner's murder
I'll submit my file and
return to Tamil Nadu, sir
Forensic officer called, sir
2 months ago, they have
killed 2 security officers
The bullets from their bodies and
the commissioner's match, sir
- What about Mallaya's details?
- He is Mr Krishnaraj's driver, sir?
The day after the murder, he went
on medical leave to his hometown
Medical leave
the very next day
- Which is his home town?
- Doospeta near Vijayanagar
What's wrong?
A gross injustice, sir
They killed the commissioner
right in front of my eyes
On that night, I went along
with Mr Krishnaraj, sir
He asked me to stop the car
a little distance away and he went alone
I waited for quite a while, so I went to
check if there was any problem, sir
At that time, commissioner was
driving the car by himself
How was he killed?
Only you are here?
What's happening here?
You didn't pay heed
to my warning, right?
'I was too far behind'
'So I couldn't hear
anything they spoke'
Wait and watch, tomorrow
all of you will be counting bars
I thought Reddy must be
involved somehow in this case
But he is the main culprit
Sir, don't include me
as a witness
They will bury me alive
with my family, sir
You be silent for now
First come and join duty
- Yes, Srinivas
- Mallaya's details match, sir
Signals of all 4 men are
from Madurawada tower
In the same 30 degree 
620 meters point
After 12 hours they erased
the call and location history
...they have modified it as being
in their respective houses
They know to influence networks
And to collapse data by hacking
This is the complete list
of criminals in Vizag
From pickpockets, bandits,
thugs who steal electricity...
...to commissioner's assassin
I've listed all their names
By this evening
we will arrest all of them
"In a different league altogether
Eye for eye, measure for measure"
"A lion in form magnetic
Duraisingam w(e)aves his magic"
"The lion that creates mayhem
Mastermind Duraisingam"
"Sends shivers in every hoodlum"
"Come and get 'em
Throw a tantrum"
Nab all of them
Are you taking any action against
the reporter who wrote this?
I believe the police is
arresting all your men
I was the one
who instructed him
That DC is on our side
"On a covert rampage
with cloud and courage"
He is arresting our men, Reddy
Hello, tell me
DC isn't picking up the phone
Let go of me, sir
Marijuana in his laptop bag, sir
I am arresting you for
murdering the commissioner
This is the network's original report
This is the report
modified by you!
You know I'm Reddy's man, right?
Aren't you ashamed to say this?
- Why did you arrest Mr Krishnaraj
- I'll tell you by this evening
"Duraisingam on the warpath
working in suppressed wrath"
"Waiting to pounce
24x7 on his rounds"
Duraisingam
Why did you arrest inspector Prakash
and asst commissioner Krishnaraj?
No DC, JC, commissioner, Home minister
or Chief minister has asked me this
You are a criminal
You dare ask me this?
Hey police!
The cops in your department
thrive on my perks
And wag their tails like dogs!
I'm not a wolf that preys
on anything that catches my eye
I am a lion that hunts
only when I am hungry
I'm hungry enough
to kill anyone now
In such a frenzy
I'll prey on anything I get
Whoever stands before me...
...I'll trample him
and walk away
Sir, what is the reason
for this sudden action?
Selva, DC is on his way
to 'encounter' you
Somehow escape
Police...run
Press and Media
don't come this way
He is armed
"Hot and happening
Duraisingam the Lion-king"
Hot coffee in Australian dollars
- Shall I give it to you steaming hot?
- Don't
I heard you roam around here
like demon Narakasura's duplicate
If I shoot you many here
will celebrate Deepavali!
You 'encountered' Beemli Selva
Did he kill the commissioner, sir?
Selva is dead, huh?
- Everything went wrong
- How could you, Vidya?
- Can you tell who killed the commissioner?
- No, not now
- What happened?
- Ravi escaped, sir
- Bro, stop the Press
- What happened?
Everything has gone wrong
Hey! Come, I say
When Reddy returns
your chapter will be closed
I heard you're on your way
to arrest Reddy
If you want your one day action
to be successful...
...don't arrest him now
Find out why he killed
the commissioner
If you arrest him
with proper evidence
...he'll be in prison
for the rest of his life
He must be right
Where's 'Andhra Today' office?
- Jagadambal circle, sir
- Let's go
Who wrote this?
That's Media ethics!
It's confidential
What...?
Investigative journalism, huh?
Are you doing an undercover operation?
Follow a criminal if you want to
write an investigative article
Watch any politician
who is a crook
Instead of that
you followed me
You've written who was with me
in room 406 in a scandalous way
It could have been
my parents, right?
Could have been
a relative of mine
You can only think crooked, huh?
To nab 10 criminals,
we'll suspect 2 good souls
To save one good man
we'll free 2 criminals
How will you understand all this?
I won't even let any stranger
anywhere near me
Just because you wanted to
take up an IPS course
...I believed you
without any doubt
You've humiliated me
You've followed a police officer and
prevented him from doing his duty
Published false information
Ruined a police officer's reputation
defamed him with slander
Come along
"He's my hero"
"Now I'm feeling like a fool"
"All I ever wanted"
"All I ever needed"
"He drives me bloody crazy"
"He's my Zorro"
"All the ways he makes me feel"
Do you agree to pay
Rs 1500 as penalty?
"And I will wait forever"
"Tell him that I'm ready"
"Hurt and hollow"
"That's the way he makes me feel"
Your reputation is also at stake
Are you behaving like an adult?
"And I will wait forever"
"I know my love is steady"
What do you want?
Why did you come here?
"He's the one for me"
I came to express my love
"He will always be
the only one for me"
"He is my Mr Right
Every single day and night"
"He is the only one for me"
"I wanna wanna need you"
"I am never gonna miss you"
"I wanna wanna need you"
"I am never gonna miss you"
"I wanna wanna need you"
"I am never gonna miss you"
Hey! Don't follow
Stop the vehicle
You sit, sir
I'll take care
Listen
He is married
Don't unnecessarily-
What's your problem?
Get lost!
Reddy, DC barged into our office,
bashed up everyone and took them
Arrested everyone, Reddy
Reddy, you told me
DC was your man?
He has killed Selvam now
He bought my trust
and backstabbed me
I won't spare him
I won't spare his life
Ignore Agni, sir
That guy who pointed out
your whereabouts...
...first we must nab him
Hey...hey...listen
The lion is in a relaxed mood
Why is this rat
getting rattled?
Veeram, I am so boiling mad,
if I get hold of that spineless scum
...I'll take my gun and-
I'll bash with a bang
My bullet won't boomerang
Dishum-dishum
Dumeel...dum!
Should smash his skull
with a solid stone, sir
Stone won't do
Nail his head with nails
Not 1/2" but 5 long
Poleaxe him from
his mouth to his bum!
Sir, talk like a respectful policeman
You're behaving like a real scumbag
How dare you call me a scumbag?
If I take out my gun
and bang bang bang-
Looks like your office has
a butterfly flitting colorfully
Nothing like that, sir
- Sir...?
- Yes, sir
Tell me, sir
I believe someone is coming
and professing her love
Looks like you get
all the updates
Want to know
who is aiding me?
No, not necessary
Subbu, looks like you are
making unnecessary calls!
Sirrrr! Was she sooper mad at you?
If your wife isn't possessive...
...life will be boring
We missed only this chap
in our investigation
If we get hold of him...
...we'll know the motive
for the murder
Why do you think so negative?
His details will-
He has met the commissioner thrice
But why is his name missing
in the visitor's record?
His name has been concealed
True, sir, but-
In case he's above suspicion...
...wouldn't he have attended
the commissioner's funeral, right?
Get the footage of commissioner's funeral
from all the TV channels
Zoom that picture
He has come, sir
The man standing next to him is...
...headmaster of the Govt school
in Madurawada, sir
He's the headmaster's friend
He's a teacher in the same school
Tell me
I need to talk to you alone
They killed him, sir
Killed them ruthlessly
Not just the commissioner
They killed 32 children
including my granddaughter
On that day in my school
after the 2nd bell
'...kids were playing in the ground'
'At that time...'
'...in Madhurwada dump yard
next to our school'
'...the trash was being burnt'
'The smoke slowly swept
towards our school'
'Our kids fainted, sir'
Sir, the kids have fainted
Sir, this is your granddaughter
Oh God! What happened to my child?
Officers from the Corporation
and Pollution department came
Politicians wandered around here and there
But 15 days later
the Press reported it as...
'Student dies due to food poisoning
in mid-day meal scheme'
I reported this news to
the commissioner
He called me after a week
Many top leaders
are involved in this
Don't file a complaint
I've arranged for
a Press meet tomorrow
Please attend the meet
Next day neither did
the Press meet happen
Nor was he alive!
The day you arrived I came
to share this news with you
'Am I here to investigate
the commissioner's murder?'
'The way you behaved that day...'
'...I just went back'
'Without knowing why...'
'...32 innocent children
lost their lives'
Tragic mass murder, sir
They had burnt the trash here
Smoke emanated from here
They've dumped
electronic items here, sir
Looks like hospital wastage, sir
Sir, I'm calling from
Uppada dump yard
Trash consists of
medicine from Australia
Waterbody has been contaminated
All Australian covers, sir
They contain human organs
Each and every cover has
'Australia' labeled on it
Get me all the details
about that CBI officer
Reddy's motive for
killing the commissioner
Medical waste from Australia...
...and e-waste from
their computer companies
...are getting dumped into
our country's dump yard
This dealing is through Rajeev Krishna
who imports it as 'Vizag Scrap'
Toxic smoke as a result
of burning this trash...
......has taken the lives of 32 children
They are selling tablets from here
well past the expiry date locally
Deducing this, the commissioner...
'...has warned Reddy'
Since he didn't comply...
...commissioner has called
for a Press meet
'Hearing this news also
through Mr Krishnaraj...'
'...they lured him to a venue and
tried to strike a deal with him'
'Since the commissioner didn't agree...'
'...they have shot him ruthlessly'
More than Reddy, we know
...there's a stronger power
...in Australia!
The entire department is angry
Where's the teacher staying?
In the headmaster's house
Get an arrest warrant
in the morning
Follow him
night and day
I'll go to the harbor tonight
And open un-dispatched
containers and get the proof
Will be around 60 to 70 containers
How many belong to Reddy?
- Maybe 40
- I'll be there in another hour
- Tell me, Reddy
- Close that teacher's chapter
I'll finish him off and call you
Tell me
Duraisingam has entered the harbor
Finish him off right there
Boys are tanked
How can they do it now?
If he checks the containers,
I won't be able to answer Vittal
Okay, I'll go myself
One of our men
is on night duty there
Get the boat
Go to the harbor
This cargo is from
Sydney Iron Scraps
Speed up
Yeah, we can open this
What's all this, sir?
It's all medi-waste
Until I get the arrest warrant tomorrow...
...none of these containers
should leave this place
Don't let them off the hook
Sir, over there
- Where is the teacher?
- Run...run, sir
Chop him
Hey! Teacher
- Where are you?
- Hey! Kill him
Drive fast
Come to Netaji nagar
That's the police...run
You bloody sinners!
- Tell me
- I killed the teacher
Stay on the line
That teacher is dead
Please be on the line
Hey, deputy commissioner
Haven't you witnessed
death in your service?
You are going overboard on this one
You've hidden your
entire background
So working as
a happy-go-lucky cop?
Who the hell are you?
Your dad is Soundara Pandi
Mom is Kalyani
Sister is Dhanalakshmi
Her kids are studying
in Infant Jesus school
Including the fact
you divorced your wife...
I know everything
Your dad owns
a grocery store in Tuticorin
You own a house
in Nallur village
I've marked your house at 8.585645
latitude and 78.056442 longitude
Paying 1 billion, on international borders
if I send a missile from a ship...
...not only your house
The entire town will
be razed to the ground
If you're appointed to
investigate a murder case
...do just that!
Why do you rake up
all the trash unnecessarily?
If you dig this dump...
He was a good man
He was under our care
Couldn't save him!
Ravi is the one
who has killed him
We traced the call you
received from Australia
Because it was an internet call,
we couldn't trace the number
We must first arrest Ravi
If he opens his mouth...
...we'll arrest Reddy
Reddy, Duraisingam won't interfere
in our business hereafter
What do you mean, sir?
You were on the con call
when I spoke to him
He was shaken up
Duraisingam has entered your area
Not even a single police
will go back alive!
I'll finish all of them
Please get me
out on bail, Reddy
Hey! Get the gun
Don't let them go
Surround the building
Start the car
Drive through the bazaar road
Straight
They are following us
Knock all the cars
on the road
Speed up...quick
No one got hurt, right?
Smash that damn car
He's disrupting the traffic
driving like a maniac
Drive towards him in DG road
and divert him to Ring road
Don't give him way
Speed up
Block him
Turn left
Don't miss
Don't allow him, overtake
Speed up
Faster
"Faster than a whirlwind
He is here to spin a win"
"A lion gathering momentum
He is Duraisingam"
"Springs lithesome"
"Eyes blazing fury"
"Just its snarl is scary"
Don't shoot me
I'll surrender, sir
What do you want, sir?
You backstabbed me, right?
If a policeman dodges,
it means he's lurking!
If he lurks, it means
he intends to strike
The dog has identified
a spot near the well
Didn't I tell you
the day we meet...
...I can assure you will be
a memorable day in your life!
I'll neither forget nor forgive!
Found the gun, sir
You've used this gun to kill
the commissioner a year ago
And 2 months ago
2 securities who worked for you
You made 'Gun' Ravi kill
our witness, Govt school teacher
Ravi has turned approver
Here, Central Minister
is on the phone
Shut up and
get into the vehicle
Otherwise I'll bury you alive
Stop...!
I heard you won't step
into the police station!
Take off your slippers and come in
Will you or should
I do the honors?
'In commissioner Ramakrishna's
murder case as a crucial turning point...'
'...renowned businessman
Madhusudhana Reddy'
'...was arrested today'
'He will be produced
in court tomorrow'
For the planned murder of
Police commissioner Ramakrishna...
...this court orders
R. Madhusudhana Reddy
...to be remanded to
judicial custody for 15 days
Sir, which jail is Reddy in now?
Will you ensure
he goes behind bars, sir?
Will you go back
to Tamil Nadu, sir?
I'm here till the charge sheet
of this case is filed
What's your comment on your 'bond' with
Reddy as reported in a weekly magazine?
Don't question me on what's reported
without getting the facts right
People will think twice before believing
what politicians or officers say
But anything published
in the Press...
...they'll believe it first
Only then they will think!
Their trust in you is so strong
Hey! He's looking at everyone
But he isn't making
eye contact with you
If he looks at me
without looking at anyone...
...then I'm special
But if he looks at
everyone and not me...
...I'm extra special!
Wi wi wi wifi
you energize me
Li li li likes many

Si si si signs you show me

Life will be a paradise of dating
Will you take me to Phuket island, love?
Will you kiss me on the boat's bow?
I'll lose my senses senselessly
Float in thoughts of you fully

Can our love be ignited
like flint stones incited?
I can burst a cracker
In my hand, no fear
Why would I be scared then
to touch you, o'maiden?
You zeroed in on my anger
You zoomed in my vigor
You planned to rob me
of my sleep completely
I would have known myself anew
I would have melted before you
Wi wi wi wifi

This is for your perusal, sir
Commissioner's murder case file
The motive for this murder
You didn't disclose
any of this in the court!
Deliberate ploy on my part, sir
This file was prepared for
the court, CBI and Govt, sir
I've created another file
for personal use
Because...
...the chap who spoke
to me from Australia
...my hometown,
about my family
He spoke volumes, sir
I'll deal with this case
from Tamil Nadu, sir
Why can't you work from here?
No, sir
This isn't a State's problem alone
Our country's problem!
To deal with this
Won't we support you?
I must be a bit crude
And bend a few rules
You must turn a blind eye to that
My State has to earn a good name
It should be glorified
I'll do anything to achieve that
I must fly to Australia at once
I'll get a confidential report of which
company is exporting containers from there
Only then take action
I'll talk to the Embassy right away
Let this be just
between you and me, sir
I'm making it out
to be a personal trip
In case those activities...
...are happening with the Australian
Govt. officials in the loop
...then we won't get
an iota of help from them
I want to see him
The chap who spoke
over the phone with me
Meet him
face to face
Vittal, you're careless
In the FIR copy
submitted to the court...
...about medi-waste,
e-waste, or dump yard
Or about the school kids
...that policeman
didn't emphasize
So...?
We can get Reddy out in 2 appeals
In another 10 days that DC
will wait outside our office
Because we cleared the medi-waste
and e-waste in Australia...
...the Govt. is giving us the iron scrap,
lock, stock and barrel for free almost
Hi tigress sweetie! Is anyone
known to us in Australia?
Our company's Australian dealer
Pushparaj anna is in Sydney
I've got a week off
So wondering if we can
go for a 2nd honeymoon!
- Hi, Kavya
- I'm flying to Australia next week
Who are you going with?
Moron of a mom!
Whom will I go with
for a honeymoon?
Book your flight
on a Full moon day
Only then the moon
will shine real bright
Mummy, why are you
still a dummy?
My dear child, your husband will claim
he's taking you on a honeymoon...
...he will go just to
arrest someone there
My mental mother
hang up now
- Sister, how are you?
- I'm fine
Mr Singam, how are you?
I've heard of a 2nd attempt in exams
And 2nd innings in cricket
1st time I'm hearing
of a 2nd honeymoon!
Shameless! Why are you
harping on this?
How could you
call me 'shameless'?
- My heart missed a beat
- Not you, bro
He was talking to the driver
Shameless fellow!
Drive properly
Lovey dovey smack up
Biggy-wiggy match up
Pushparaj, rent a car for me
"Ema gama gama got up"
'Roaring lion'
'Daring lion'
'Soaring lion'
'Rocking lion'
Wanna wanna wanna higher
"Gonna gonna gonna fire"
"Gotta gotta gotta near"
"Never never never fear"
'Sydney Mission'
'Own decision'
"Has the vision"
'For the nation'
"He crossed the high seas"
"He whizzed like the breeze"
"Stood his ground
Every nano second"
"Confirmed win
for this cop with grit"
"Lone battalion roaring lion"
Gutsy gritty daring lion
"Spunky spirited soaring lion"
"King of the jungle rocking lion"
"Dare to defy
this roaring lion"
You're flying a camera
on a helicopter?
Shouldn't we know
what's on the other side?
They may spot us
Let's get out of here
Wait, let the right person show up
- Yes, Veeram?
- Sir, where are you?
I'm in Tuticorin
I called home and
they said you haven't come
- Talk to one of our townsfolk
- Give it to him
- What, bro?
- Hi hobo
- Why don't you believe 'sir'?
- I won't you know
If you keep saying this
I'll break your teeth
I'll rip your ears to pieces
I'll spray Tuticorin salt on your face
I'll stuff Kovilpatti mud
into your mouth
He stoops even lower than me
- Sir is in Tuticorin
- How are you so sure?
He's drawling
Tuticorin slang to the T
"Re-re-re reloading re-re-reloading"
"Big bad-der boss boom
bullet on a zoom"
"Flew into Sydney, a new direction"
"Got it all locked down
None to question"
"Didgeridoo, if you know who"
"He could do it solo
what takes two"
"Gonna leave a trail in New South Wales"
"Kangaroo kick!
This man's so fleek!"
- What is this building?
- Vittal Steel office, sir
Our Central Minister Ram Prasad's son
Why take it into this office?
Check if there's any Australian number
in the phone we seized from Reddy
Will call back
in 10 minutes, sir
There is just one Australian number under
the name Vittal in the sim we processed
They've been in touch
once in 2 days, sir
Give me that number
'If you dig this dump...'
' ...I'll dig the grave
for your family'
The same voice that spoke to me
Vittal is the mastermind
behind this whole scam
Take Murali into custody
Ask him to wait for
my call in Control room
My flight is at
6:00 p.m tomorrow
Can you fix an appointment
with Vittal by 11:00 a.m?
I'll get someone
in 2 minutes
Pushparaj'na
How did you marry her?
How else but by tricking her!
Some chap promised to get me a job
in Australia and ditched me
To work here, I needed a Green card
To get the Green card, I had to
marry a white card like this
I'm a big black card myself!
At that time
'I will marry only a dark fellow'
So said my darling and made
a royal exit from the country
"With his coal black hands he hugged me"
"My love blossomed ever so tenderly"
The moment I married her...
...through your father
I became a dealer of India Cycles
Thanks to sir, I've even
become a policeman!
- Hey!
- What...?
You didn't tell your wife
about your investigation?
Please tell her, sir
Cough up the truth
Don't lie to your wife
You'll regret it later
Blabbermouth!
My mom warned me
when I was packing
How is your holiday?
Your son-in-law is doing
his 'look for the crook' here too!
Didn't I tell you?
My dad is a textile store
Your dad is a cycle store
Your husband's dad
is a grocery store
Your husband is a police booth!
They don't even know
the spelling of 'jolly'!
They'll only be job-aholics!
Hear me out
If I had told you earlier, would you
have enjoyed these 4 days?
You would have been so stressed
As far as we are concerned
...it should be a 100% holiday
That's why I didn't
inform you earlier
Now spare me for just 1/2 hour
for an appointment
I'll be right back
Quick as a wink!
- Where are you going?
- Investigation going on
Murali, I am in Vittal's office
I'm connected to their wifi
We must get the access point
Enter the number I give you, sir
"The lion stalks its prey stealthily
Duraisingam on a hunting spree"
"Pounces powerfully"
"The lion in the enemy's den
Duraisingam the unbeaten"
"Prowls for a reason"
- Then...deputy commissioner?
- That's my profession
I came here for 2 reasons
If you supply 8000 tons
annually to my company ...
...it will be useful
for my production
One random scumbag...
...called me from Australia
He threatened to
wipe out my family
He can't even pluck a blade
of grass from Nallur, my hometown
I came to pass on
this message directly
Whether I clinch that deal
of 8000 ton scrap or not...
...that 80 kilo lazy buffalo
...will definitely fall
into the palm of my hand
He has taken off
and gone to his hometown
I am watching him
What happened?
Why did you leave?
Boss wanted to meet you
Let me talk to your boss
I know you are
that 80 kilo buffalo
To target you I've crossed the boundaries
of my hometown, country and continent
Indian police, I say
- Kavya
- What happened?
Our flight is only at 6 p.m
Stay in the airport
Don't stay in the city till then
He thinks I've come alone
Let him assume so
Use Indian number
Trash the local sim cards
Don't come with me
I'll leave the car in the airport
Settle the bill
His name is Duraisingam
And that's ME!
"Duraisingam; force to reckon with"
"Pounces pits to zenith"
"Duraiingam; a lion with guts and grit"
If you land ahead of him
he'll think you've got the jitters
Stop right there
Why did you come here?
I haven't seen your sir
for a week
We have strict orders
not to let you in
Lift her scooty
- Lift...throw
- Where are you taking it?
Don't throw her
Trying your tricks with me!
Just you wait!
I'll hook your boss
I'll marry him
I'll come here as his wife
Then watch how I torture you
- My deaaaaaar!
- What happened?
He has fractured
the crab's legs, dear
Fracture, huh?
Oooh! Aaah! Ouch!!
- Glutton! Won't the crab be hurt?
- Did you buy it as a pet?
Not just one day
I'll torture you
every single day
The loo needs to be cleaned
Leave someone behind
I'll leave Veeram behind
Wonder why I was named
'Veeram' meaning bravery
- My 'Veeram' has gone for a toss
- He's saying it as pun intended
Kill him via 'encounter'
Encounter, huh?
Pun intended, huh?!
Don't forget
I belong to the Press
Not Press
Pressure cooker
- How many whistles!
- You dare raise your voice
I'll crush your Adam's apple
Men get it often
- Women sometimes
- What?
- Anger
- Oh! That, huh?
I'll finish you off
through Facebook
I'll twist you via Twitter
I'll wipe you out
in WhatsApp
Are all these your thugs?
- She's acting like Google Pichai's sister
- Who is that?
I'll grow old explaining to you
First put her behind bars
She's a jailbird!
She'll come out on bail
through Email!
Look how I tame her!
Hereafter I am
your slave forever
I'll listen to whatever you say
- Yes, Subbu
- Reddy is out on bail
- They humiliated us, sir
- What happened?
8 lawyers came from Delhi
to take Reddy out on bail, sir
How did he get the bail?
3 of them surrendered claiming
they killed the commissioner
2 of them were criminals who had
escaped from Vijayawada police encounter
What I couldn't digest was
the reason they gave, sir
He claimed the commissioner
constantly tortured his wife sexually
To escape that, they joined hands
and killed him is his story, sir
They ruined his name
CBI lawyer didn't utter
a single word, sir
This is all Reddy's doing, sir
This is Vittal's game plan
He has started showing his power
I'm sure you witnessed it?
You had a glimpse of my power?
You heard?
You heard about
the court proceedings?
I was loaded
with power and position
You saw to it I was positioned
in a room without power!
I'll take away your power and pull
by this evening, just you wait
By tomorrow evening
I'll close your chapter
Sir, CBI is on the line
They want to see you immediately
Did you pay heed to me
when I cautioned you repeatedly?
The dead won't come alive
At least let the others
carry on with their lives
Now haven't you
made it even worse?
You've showed a person
who is very diligent...
...can't even have
a dignified death?!
My 2 daughters are back home
from school totally humiliated
Now all our neighbors...
...look at us scornfully
Shall I drown in the sea
along with my daughters?
Why should we die?
With whatever grit and guts
you arrested that Reddy...
...with the same bravery and bravado
...close his chapter and prove
my husband's integrity and diligence
Otherwise-
Tell me
Why did you arrest Reddy?
He has asked Reddy for some bribe
When he refused, he has fabricated
the commissioner's murder case on him
The article clearly states his link
with Reddy in bold letters
Who sent you to Australia?
For what purpose?
How do you know
I went to Australia?
Did Vittal Prasad tell you?
Are you here to do what he says?
Is it for India
or Australia?
Mr Duraisingam?
We are terminating you from CBI
People are under the impression
CBI will render justice to all cases
Don't tarnish that trust
I got to know all that happened
I don't want an apology from you now
I am relieving myself
from Tamil Nadu police
Give me a posting
as Andhra police
All I need is your signature
I will re-write his fate
"He wore his khaki uniform you see"
Bottled within him red hot fury
He will pound to a pulp mercilessly
Who will bear the brunt of his fury?
He is second to none; extraordinary
"Universal cop"
"Very, very sharp"
Just a single strike from him will do
1.5 ton force it will change into
If he rises to bash, that's the end
Like a missile he will descend
An unofficial target
Transfer all the cops
who support Reddy, sir
"Universal cop"
"Very, very sharp"
If you lay a finger on us
we will complain to the judge
You can do so
only if you are alive!
If you blunder once
and that too
knowing it's wrong
...even if he is God Almighty
I will not spare him
What is your name?
Mo...MoMoses, sir
Have you read the Bible?
- Do you know what Romans 6:23 says?
- No, sir
Wages of sin is death
What?
As a false witness you boldly
claimed you killed a police officer
Why are you flustered
looking at a murder?
These 3 have turned approvers
against Reddy
Reddy got wind of this
On the way to the judge's house
2 men were shot by Reddy's goons
You're repeating this story
verbatim to the judge
"In his police uniform to strike
with confidence he will stride"
"In just a single glance
he'll weigh his prey, pros and cons"
"In his police uniform to strike
Dash and daring, he will stride"
Reddy, DC has got
an arrest warrant on you
Turn the car
Reddy has been informed
He might try to escape
"Criminals with evil intentions
Forced to flee to different nations"
"To wipe out crime in fact"
They are holding me captive, sir
"Is there any case he can't unlock?
This cop sure can walk the talk"
"Universal cop"
"He is razor sharp"
"Universal cop"
"Very, very sharp"
'Duraisingam takes drastic action
against rowdies involved in the riot'
No hurdle is an obstacle
Let's cross, really simple
"Come on, rap-a-tap-tap"
India has 4800000 fishermen
20,000 boats sail in the high seas
Who are you?
Military in mufti
Unpaid navy!
No trespasser can enter
our nation defying you
You shouldn't allow either
"Rap-atap-tap"
"Like a volcano erupting"
"Like birds with their wings flapping"
"To reach great heights, paths will favor"
"What he sets his mind to, he'll conquer"
Bravo! Dare to defy
Spread your wings to fly
Rock on, with your style
Achieve your goal, worth the while
His bullet zooms
to pierce his victims
In Govt dump yard of 100 acres or more...
...medi-waste has been dumped
Underground water has turned toxic
to the effect of 1000 acres
I'll support you
in every step
No one should throw even
an used tea cup on the roads
You should think twice even
before you light a matchstick!
"If anyone dares to take him for a ride"
"With a flash of a smile
this cop will push him aside"
"Universal cop"
I have to meet you immediately
- Right now?
- Yes
I'll meet you in Kailashgiri
"Universal cop"
"Very, very sharp"
What's up with you?
You came here
as a CBI officer
Now you're inviting
more and more trouble
I'm in a mood of fury
mixed with frenzy
Don't bug me
This city is totally different
Why do you struggle here?
I am really petrified
Let's leave this
and go back home
If I get my hands on a case
I should either win or lose
I am standing in between
If you feel bad seeing
all this, just leave
Go back right away
Because you blabbered
in front of everyone...
...he had no other go
but to claim he is divorced
I need to divorce my wife
Whom should I deal with?
- I'll deal this case
- What's your problem?
My wife goes on a show-off spree
- Shows what?
- Anger
Sometimes when I ask her
to show, she refuses
- What is this?
- Love
He is being ambiguous
We lived together for 3 years
and bond was so strong
3 months after we got married
the ties loosened
What's 'livington gether'?
Without being formally married
living under the same roof informally
Stick together like glue
Or find someone new
What's right about that?
In the case of
a couple divorcing...
...if a rule is passed for money
got as wedding gifts to be returned
...will you go in for divorce?
Scumbags who have risen
to ruin our culture
I'll butcher you
Why are you waiting here?
Working odd hours
or different city...
...so many feel terrible
not being with their spouse
You're demanding a divorce!
How dare you block all our containers!
"Fast & furious in strategem
Mean-machine Duraisingam"
"Power packed action is his emblem"
Dad, I am on my way to Vizag
That Duraisingam has to meet me
in my office at 12 noon
Why are you hiding in
your home town now?
'Come immediately'
We will show him
Vizag is under our control
Dad, I've landed in Vizag
He will be in your office at 12:30
- Chief minister will call you now
- Why?
Don't be tense
I'll handle everything
I don't get it
For what, sir?
From State minister to central ministers...
'...they are pulling strings
to release the containers'
He is so stubborn as to insist
you meet him by 12:30 in his office
Wrong, sir
If you have to be here
at this particular time...
...in Opera house, Sydney, Australia
At 33.8 latitude
151.2 longitude
I decided yesterday
Do you realize at least now?
Necessity is not the reason
for earning all this money
To get a 'high'
2 million a month
Even though you can accept bribes...
...if working for a meager salary
of 60000 is your passion
My company has
6400000 share holders
12,300 employees
in my company
What crime did I commit?
I brought all the rubbish
and dumped it in your trash cans
You dump your trash
only on your roads
You pee on your walls
Your whole country
is a land of rubbish bins
What are you trying to say?
The containers you blocked
in the beginning...
...release them from the port
...sit in a toll booth
and issue tokens
And then...?
Close Reddy's file at once
- Where is Reddy now?
- Heading towards Vizag, sir
Stop the car...stop!
"The cop with a mission"
Hit and finish him off
Stop...stop...!
"Cop who rules the game
Duraisingam is his name"
Reverse the car
"Courage is his surname"
"Deadly ultimatum
Decreed by Duraisingam"
Smash him
Turn right
Block his car
Get the car here
If you let him be like this,
how long will he be alive?
Hey! We will take immense pleasure
in watching you suffer and die slowly
All of you, sit down
Kill me
Does it hurt?
Think you can die
without the pain?
It's easy to die
Tough to live
To lead life as a good man
is doubly difficult
Extremely difficult to live
without hurting others
Not only did you kill
an honest police officer...
...but you also tarnished
that good soul's name in court
I decided that day
An arrest is easy way out for you
You should go to hell
6 years ago
...to save Vittal's father's position
...you created a riot in the city
Do you remember that?
In that riot...
...you toppled a school van with
18 children with no compassion whatsoever!
A child in that van died
Are you aware of that?
That child's father...
...is an honest police officer?
Do you know that?
Subbu, I know the pain
in your heart can never fade
But shoot him
And soothe your pain
with this medicine
Come on
He led a royal life like a king
He's an abandoned corpse now
What gall Duraisingam has
to execute him like this?
In this country...
...police officers have been
given this kind of power?
First talk to your dad and find
a way to move the containers
A policeman's family
...fearing for their lives and
evacuating because of a criminal
...should never be in
any official record
I'll always be there for you
with my band of loyal men
My dear lad
My girls are able to go to school
without any hassle nowadays
Where's my man?
I must meet him immediately
Listen, Vidya
He hasn't divorced his wife
His wife is happily married to him
Wipe out all your plans
from your scheming head
I warned you the other day
But you didn't believe me
You could've dinned it
into my head, right?
In such a way I would
have got the message
Used cuss words to
make me come to my senses
Or hit me hard
and hammered it in
Why are you crying?
Vidya...look at me
Stop crying, please
They've transferred me, sir
Duraisingam has blocked
all our containers
The Press is swarming there
Why have you stopped them?
All the containers have
been cleared by Customs
- You got no right to stop this
- Fat hopes!
340 acres
Only the harbor is
under central Govt
Other than that, the entire State
...is under our control!
Shut up and stand aside
Sir, what's all this?
Why don't you arrest them, sir?
We can but they will claim
they sent the wrong load
And they will agree
to send it back!
Who is behind this, sir?
Maybe a business man in Australia
May be a millionaire too
All your 'mays' are assumptions
How will you find out?
I know you are watching me
Vittal has to come and meet me
in my station at sharp 11'o clock
Our boss isn't here
The entire Press wants
to know the details
If I open my mouth...
40 press, 400 policemen...
...customs, pollution control board
...tahsildars, sub registrars, collectors
...will queue outside your office
If he comes around 11-
Around or ground!
Don't come with your stooges
hovering and covering for you
You must come alone
All of you
wait outside
You decided to meet me in your office
just the day before
To make you stand here...
...I decided the day I met you!
That's why the container
I should've opened long ago...
...I opened it today!
Making money
gives you a high, huh?
Then get sloshed and
be sprawled somewhere
If you work for a living in a country
of kangaroos and wolves...
...and you have such temerity
...then living in a land of glory
with lions, tigers and cheetahs
...imagine my pride and arrogance!
You're dumping trash in lakes and ponds
providing water for farming and drinking
Your conscience doesn't prick?
32 innocent children
...gasped for breath
because of you and-
You have no regret?
And you have the gall to be cheeky!
God has blessed you
with abundance
Then why do you pinch
another man's bread and butter?
Maligning your homeland is equal to
deriding one's own dear mother
Instead of littering chocolate wrappers
on the roadside, nowadays...
...school kids stuff them in their pockets
to trash it only in a dust bin
Trash bins in every street corner
And toilets in every road
That day will dawn soon
Then our country will be
in a different level altogether
You dare trash my country
as a rubbish bin?
Our country is rich in resources
I can strip you right now
and remand you to police custody
But if I do so...
...your employees, share holders
and general public will be affected
I'll give you another chance
If you put an end to this
shameful profession and surrender
But if I catch you-
Yes, sir?
I'm in Mumbai
Will you act smart?
Will you say that?
Why are you hitting
an innocent kid?
If I say something, he retorts
in a bad way, using swear words, sir
Normally we yell at our wives
May be 500 - 1000 cuss words
Do you know this kid's cuss word
vocabulary at this tender age?
Ask him a question
Hear his twisted reply
Don't hit him
Let me ask him
Smart chap, tell me
- Daddy
- Rowdy!
- Mummy
- Dummy
- Fire, dude
- Slipper you!
Water
Sir, don't ask further
He'll bitch about your mother!
My father's name is Kathamuthu
I named him after my father
with so much love
Ask him his name
Let me go in his own route
My dear lad
Tell me your grandpa's name
Katha-muthu
Psychopath-u!
That's why I told you
Arrest and put him in jail!
You should be thrown into prison
If you talk to your wife
with your kid around...
...you should speak
words of fragrance
- Fragrant words?
- I mean
For example
hear this
My dear precious gem
My sweet cuckoo
Listen to me
Whatever I tell you now...
...follow my lip movement
And you rhyme properly, okay?
Rose
Garland
What's that 'aah' for?
Rose-garland
Heard that?
You can be a businessman
in Australia
From what he says
it has to be Vittal Prasad
If interviewed in
a crisscross way
...he'll certainly blabber something
Do you need all this?
Duraisingam sir needs him
For my stupid mistake...
...I must compensate somehow
Keep an eye on Madurawada
and Walter's area
- Pa?
- Durai
Tell me, pa
Kavya's grandma passed away!
We have to leave now
To your hometown
Why all of a sudden?
Meet me at the airport, I'll tell you
I'm heading to Chennai
for a meeting, sir
What happened?
Your grandma...
...passed away it seems!
I think she's his wife
Until I get her details
follow her, okay?
Grandma
He was close to a female here
They've web-checked already
into a Chennai-Tuticorin flight
Let me carry it for you
Car is waiting, sir
Follow that car
- Pazhani...?
- Sir...?
Pull the car to the kerb
Hey! Start the car
Reverse...quick
Go...go...fast
What gall! You'll follow
a police officer?
Who are you? Let go of me, sir
I followed without knowing
it was sir's car!
Who the hell asked you
to follow a police officer?
Girl in the photo
is Duraisingam's wife
India Cycles owner's daughter
You're Vittal's fake beneficiary
You were going to Chennai for a meeting
Why did you follow me?
Sir, should I come there?
You sent our photo
in WhatsApp?
Received the reply by Telegram
Either you should've stopped tailing me
in Chennai or Tuticorin airport
Instead you're following us
till our hometown?
We got all the details
of that girl
You come back, okay?
How will he get back?
He can only take an U turn!
After we pound him to a paste...
...if he drags your name
in Tuticorin court
...his voice will echo in Vizag court!
A boat is leaving for Andaman
Shall we board him into it?
He won't make it
Keep him in a launch in the sea
near Nallathanni Theevu
You stay here
I'll go in and come
But she wrote an article
against Duraisingam, sir
Ask her to come in
Unload it there
That reporter is recording everything
with a hidden camera in her bag
You're #1 in the Steel industry-
She's Duraisingam's girlfriend!
Which country do you
take iron wastes from?
Which country
do you take it from?
You are a business tycoon in Australia
E-waste, medi-waste
Did Duraisingam send you here?
Did Duraisingam send you
to ask me all this?
- Came in to interview
- No one came
She's a good bait
Using her, we can bring out
Rajeev Krishna very easily
Pack her up
- She came in
- You're mistaken
- Who is this?
- I'm Vidya's friend
- What happened?
- To help you she went to interview Vittal
She texted me
she had a problem
But when I enquired
they deny even seeing her!
Send me Vidya's phone number
Called me directly
That girl has nothing to do with it
Leave her alone
If she isn't connected
why are you calling her?
You have your wife in the factory...
...telling the whole world
you're a divorcee
...are you dating this girl?
Your wife...
...looks beautiful
Such a stunner!
I'll let go of him
I can only send him by road
Can't get him on a flight
- He got hurt a little bit
- Hurt...?
Ask your men
to hand him over
But your signal has to
be only in Tutitcorin
If you do your police gimmicks
and intelligence...
You leave immediately
No, Kavya
How can I go-?
It's alright
Divya is coming from London
only tomorrow morning
We'll attend to
the funeral rites
Attend to your work
My mobile signal should
show only Tuticorin
I'm on my way to Vizag
but I must take all calls
Calls shouldn't get diverted
Is there a way?
Buy a prepaid card from that area
Send me the sim number
at the back of that card
In half an hour
I can double activate it
We are sailing
to mid sea, sir
Come back to the shore
Get him into the car
Leave immediately with him
I'll take the next flight to Vizag
You'll reach Naidupettai
toll gate only at 3:00 a.m
By then I'll find out
where that girl is
Shanmugam, ask few of your men...
...to follow that jeep
at a distance of 300 meters
Rest over the phone
I'll land in Vizag by 8:30
Call Vidya's friend
and get all the details
Check all the toll gates in
the suburbs with this car number
I'll reach in 1 and 1/2 hours
Bro, we are entering Andhra
When we traced that car...
...it has crossed
Port road tollgate
Sir, please come
This is the car
Please zoom in
Would it have crossed
the next toll gate?
You can view footages of
all toll gates on NH 5, sir
That car hasn't crossed
Aganampudi as yet, sir
Then it has crossed
the same toll gate again
Show me footages
of return vehicles
Sir, that vehicle has
returned in 8 minutes
Maybe they took
the girl back to the city?
Or transferred her to another car
Show me footages from Aganampudi
in the 5:00 to 5.30 time frame
In this...
...which vehicles didn't
cross this toll gate?
I'll connect, sir
Only one ambulance hasn't
crossed this toll gate as yet
That ambulance has returned
in 10 minutes to Aganampudi toll gate
'Returned immediately?'
A girl who is unwell is missing
- Is she admitted here?
- This is public charity hospital
That too, if you search at this hour
all the patients will be disturbed, sir
You must be right, I agree
Sir, what is this?
You thrust that girl in here
Somehow the damn cops sniffed
their way in here, sir
What do you mean?
Sir, you've come back here agai-
Policemen are dogs, huh?!
I placed a phone here to
overhear your conversation
- We are at the toll gate
- Hold on, I'll call you
Wait
To take revenge on me
Vittal has a girl as hostage
Can't take her to any other hospital
Can I go to our factory hospital?
Take her immediately
I'll get everything organized
By mixing Propofol with morphine
they have administered an overdose
She won't regain consciousness
for another 3 days
But not treating her
is also very risky
If she should regain
consciousness?
Sir, I need your signature
Central minister Mr Ramprasad
is on the line
Your son-in-law is disturbing
my son too much
Why are you telling me this?
Then don't ask me if your son-in-law is
found stabbed in the middle of the road
Similarly if your son is shot
in the open by my son-in-law-
What audacity!
I have no son as heir
Half my wealth of 120 billion,
60 billion is his
If he has renounced this lap of luxury,
working for a salary of Rs 65000 only
...what fervent fury
he must possess
First ask your son to surrender
Make an appointment with the judge
for 10:30 p.m to get an arrest warrant
But don't disclose the name
Every single word
I speak to the judge
The evidence I submit
...should be relayed
'live' for the general public
Here is your ticket to Hyderabad
Drop Vidya at home
I'm not going anywhere, sir
Look here, I am not prepared
to lose people close to me
What did you say, sir?
I said, 'leave now'
You said something like
'people close to you'
I thought you'll regard me
as your enemy for all my blunders
I thought I was doing you a favor
when I first fell in love with you
Only when I knew
you won't reciprocate my love...
...I knew how truly
I was in love with you
I am unable to forget you, sir
If I lock myself in my room
and cry the whole day...
...I'll forget everything, sir
- What happened to that vehicle?
- Not starting
- Be brave
- Okay, bro
- I can see the red car
- Go inside
- Hey...you there!
- I placed it there, bro
- Careful, sir
- Srinivas
Call the ambulance
4 cops died in a bomb blast
in the police station it seems
Why did you let the Press in?
I have no hang ups about
media knowing the case details
Do you have any problems, sir?
I have no problem
Tell me
Which case?
- What is this?
- 435 documents and agreements
Agreements signed by many
medical universities for medi-waste
How did he get hold of all this?
Soft copies from
my Super computer
All this is documentary evidence
Vittal Prasad's fake beneficiary
Rajeev Krishna has turned approver
District judge and collector
of Tuticorin are with him
Subbu, block his passport at once
He shouldn't cross the city limits
We must arrest him before dawn
Our boss isn't here
Vittal's number is switched off
in S.K Nagar tower
Unable to track it
He would have definitely
called his dad
Central minister hasn't received
any call after 12 midnight, sir
Murali, through signal
triangulation method...
...can't we find out the numbers
in and around the minister's number?
Sir, there's a London number
next to the minister's signal
That number has been
receiving calls from Australia
The Australian number was switched on
at 12:15 in S.K Nagar tower
In the next 1/2 hour
crossing the Gail toll gate...
...it has moved
down the highway
I'm sure this is the number
Trace its signal
He will reach Vijayawada
in 2 and 1/2 hours
Any flight now to Vijayawada?
In 1 hour
The signal crossing Vijayawada
is on the highway to Hyderabad now
He's trying to catch the 11:30
Malindo flight to Malaysia
Sir, you're 500 meters away
- I can see only a container ahead of me
- The signal is from there, sir
Overtake that vehicle
Both the signals are intersecting, sir
Check inside
Take a look, sir
No one here, sir
It's empty, sir
He can never find you
Another 12 km
you'll be in Telengana
Someone is making a call to
the minister even now from there
- What do you mean?
- No one can touch you after that
- Isn't this 40 feet in length?
- Yes, sir
Govindaraj, get in and
measure the length
Sir, stop!
Tell me
- Which city?
- Visakhapatnam
That is Andhra Pradesh
This is Telangana
Can't allow you
A criminal is escaping
I have to catch hi-
We can handle all that
His passport has been blocked
How could you let-
Immigration will handle all that
This is an emergency
This is an arrest warrant
This is the passport
cancellation copy
Knowing all this, how did you
board him on this flight?
By now my dad and
chief minister will be in Vizag
I'll be out in an hour
as soon as we reach
I'll fly to Australia
in just 1 day
In a week, 2 containers
will land in India
Both cities from the Indian map will
fall into the sea the very next minute
Do you think I am
taking you to court?
We will be soon at the banks
of river Godavari
The car will lose control
and fall into the river
40 feet deep
We will escape
Bloody mongrel of a criminal!
You'll drown handcuffed!
How much longer?
Speed up
Faster, drive faster
Just because you have a gun
will you 'encounter' me?
What will you do now?
Knock me down and kill me
"The lion, king of the jungle
Duraisingam on a mission possible"
Are you scared to die?
Didn't I tell you to surrender
giving up this shameless profession?
You needn't have even got arrested
Just shut down your shady business
Instead you've anchored
400 containers of trash in mid sea?
As if I'll allow!
Not only did you kill
32 innocent kids
You planted bombs in police station
and in cars going to and fro
You brag to me, you'll delete
2 cities from the map
One who blunders
in anger will reform
One who commits a crime in a position
of authority will never reform
You dare deride my country
as a trash can?
You are the trash
English subtitles by rekhs
assisted by harini
Central minister Ram Prasad
has been dismissed from his post
My wedding has been fixed, sir
I don't intend
sending you an invitation
Nor insist you attend
I plan on deleting
your number from my phone
That's why
I need to meet you right away
Where are you?
I'll be there in an hour, sir
Another city again, huh?
"Here comes the lion
The one man battalion"
