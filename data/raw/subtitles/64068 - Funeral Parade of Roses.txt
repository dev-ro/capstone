FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES
A beautiful day.
It's too bright.
Okay?
Yes. I don't like the sun.
Like an owl.
Oh, no. Give me that.
Like my muscles?
Can you lift the chair?
Of course.
Help me.
How do I look?
Beautiful, Eddie.
You like my hair down or up?
Both.
I hate to leave you.
Don't quit the bar.
I have to.
Give me time.
I'll make Leda quit the bar.
Then, you'll be
the proprietress.

Your hand.
Everybody! Your hand, please!
What is it?
Open your hand.
What's this?
You look exactly like a girl.
How long have you been queen?
Four years.
Why did you decide to become queen?
I wanted to be a girl.
I like it.
You like girls?
No. I like to behave like one.
How does it satisfy you?
I'm very happy now.
Will you be a "man" again?
I don't think so.
Will you be a transsexual?
No. I won't go that far.
How long?
Since last December.
How come?
I like it.
You like what?
To be gays.
Gays?
You mean you like men?
Not exactly.
I can't tell.
I like gays, that's all.
Being a queen?
How come?
I was born that way.
Born?
Hello! It's been a long time.
A funny place.
I was beat.
Too much sex.
Do you know this?
What is it?
As if you didn't know.
It's that.
Oh, no! You embarrass me.
Watch!
It's changed.
In this quarter, yes.
Bad environment!
It was good in Akasaka.
Good old days!
This is the Madame.
Beautiful!
Wonderful!
Telephone.
Excuse me.
Hello. Mr. Lida?
Where are you?
The Jardin?
Come over here.
I'll be waiting. See you later.
"Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who is the fairest of all?"
You're late.
I'm sorry.
You came very early.
She amazes me.
By the way, have you brought it?
Where to, Tony?
Steady!
No. All right, cut!
I'll do it.
Take it easy.
Ass! Leave it to me.
Slowly.
Okay?
No.
Okay?
No.
This is as far as I can make.
No good.
Damn it!
Good! It's okay.
I'm talented!
Hardly!
Don't move!
Yeah, like this...
Cut! That's all.
- 20 feet more.
- Smoke.
Keep it.
I want to smoke marijuana.
Eddie's absent.
Burn banana peel.
Doesn't work.
I've two drugs.
Give me.
Only two!
Eye-lotion helps.
Drink it!
Ominous...
He's okay. Look.
FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES
She's shameless!
She makes me mad.
Don't worry.
Young people have
different ways of thinking.
You're encouraging them.
Don't be critical, or
no one will work with you.
But Eddie has bad manners.
All she knows is coquetry.
Times have changed.
But queens should have pride, too.
We must respect ourselves.
What's wrong?
I cut my leg. I'm bleeding.
Look.
Ouch!
It's like a mosquito bite.
You're all right now.
Don't be hysterical.
I'm sorry. I was anxious.
What about?
You'd desert me.
Stupid.
You won't?
Never.
Which do you like better,
me or Eddie?
You, of course.
Have fun together.
Come with me.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You alone?
Yes. I'm all right now.
How about a drink with me?
Keep me company.
Every man has his own mask...
which he has carved for a long time,
Some wear the same masks
all their lives, but....
others use a variety of masks.
Some masks stress the features,
but, ..
Others are far from their original,
Some are poor and easily
distinguishable, but, ..
Others are so skillfully made,
they're hardly distinguishable,
People always wear masks
when they face each other.
They see only masks.
Even if they remove their masks....
their faces seldom expose themselves,
Because there may be second masks.
And even third masks...,
hidden under the first ones.
Therefore, people often take
your masks for you.
And you take theirs for them.
The objective of love and
hatred may be the masks.
...,faces suffer Ioneliness.
People try to escape from it...,
and make new masks.
Where are we going?
Look, Guevara.
You want this?
Insert it.
"What a sly,
mysterious scheme!"
Cut.
Oh, wait... Okay.
Okay!
Don't need the microphone.
Next, an interview with Rabbit.
An interview?
We only have 20 minutes left.
Only 20 minutes.
Let's have an interview with Rabbit.
You like the love scene?
A man loves a man. As a queen,
what do you think?
Don't you feel guilty?
Well, you can love a man
as well as a woman.
If you're in love,
it makes no difference.
Have queens little interest in girls
as an object of sex?
There are various types.
I can't say yes or no.
Are you interested more
in men than in women?
Me personally?
I mean generally.
Generally, yes.
They tell themselves they're women.
How about you?
Me? You can guess.
Do you know? "NHSMC."
Nihon Homosexual Men's Club.
Where is it?
Minamicho.
There's a party every week.
The members bring handsome boys.
A weekly reported it.
That's Akasaka.
Really?
You mean the secret club
for homosexuals?
A lot of them.
There are many pretenders, too.
Pretenders?
They pretend to be "gay."
They can earn more that way.
Don't look at us like that.
We're genuine.
Detectives are here.
Detectives?
Eddie.
You know him?
Who?
Yagawa.
He's missing.
I don't know.
It was twelve years ago.
You don't remember.
Forget about Father. You have me.
How delicious!
Don't peep.
How nice!
Pretty!
Expensive.
A present for me.
Patron?
Yes.
Old news.
I didn't know.
Excuse me.
Me, too.
Me, too.
What good is she?
She's just a loafer.
Come, come.
Nothing is good.
Watch out.
I understand. Go to bed.
Promise you'll fire Eddie,
or I won't move.
You're impossible.
Eddie is the number-one
girl in the Genet Bar.
Customers come to see her.
Note that.
You're in love with her. Say so.
Stupid!
You're always complaining.
How sneaky!
Are you a man?
"Are you a man?"
That's a question I ask you.
I'll make one thing clear. If anyone
has to quit, it's you, not her.
I understand.
Try to fire me if you can.
I'll expose your secret business.
"Then, you don't love mankind?"
Don't desert me.
No kidding!
"No. I hate it."
Damn Leda!
If she acts funny...
Say no more.
Stop! Please stop.
Why?
I'm sick.
Let me get down.
Don't be nervous, Eddie.
I'll take you home.
I want fresh air.
You all right?
I'll call you later.
Ominous...
"Ready"
You like it?
I don't know.
Ears are humming.
I've never seen it
like this before.
Pull off the cord.
It's "underground," isn't it?
Yes.
You look surprised.
I am.
"All definitions of cinema
have been erased."
"All doors are open now."
"...- Menas Jokas."
Jonas Mekas.
Of course.
But you must feel something
with your body.
It's intoxicating.
Really? I prefer a real drug.
Very good!
It's about time for it.
No.
Oh, pot!
Good!
No!
Don't push me.
Two for me.
Two. No credit.
Stingy!
You, Piro?
One.
How much marijuana have you smoked?
I smoked a lot.
I smoked very hard.
How do you feel smoking?
I feel like I'm floating
up from the chair.
That's a matter of myself.
A chair on a rock.
You know that?
A chair on a rock.
It's not so hard to touch.
I'm floating up in the air
from the bed.
I want that feeling.
I want more of it.
Have you ever smoked marijuana?
No.
Drugs?
All the time.
What kind?
Minahai and Norumo.
When I'm out,
I take Maruso and Donton.
How do you feel?
Well, my senses become paralyzed.
I become psychologically idle.
That's all.
Well, I find myself in a...
state of mind
where I can't see myself.
Something like ecstasy?
Not like ecstasy or anything.
When I take it too much...
I don't even remember
I have taken it.
I don't feel I'm existing.
But still...
so I hear later...
I moved around and
do many things.
It's interesting.
What are you looking for
through the experience?
I'm not looking for anything.
It's meaningless.
How did you get yourself
caught in the habit?
It's like alcohol. Easier
to take than alcohol.
You're tickling me!
Okei.
Try hard, Okei.
The top? The bottom?
The top.
You're a glamorous type.
Guevara, go for it.
See, I told you.
Take off your shirts!
Dirty undershirt!
Eddie.
Me? No.
Try hard, Eddie.
Strip!
Not yet. Take this off.
"The first chapter ended."
"I'll leave you and go
on my next trip."
"Roses"
"Oh, the empire of roses!"
Hello.
Let's go to the beauty parlor.
Wait.
Yes.
I'll put a make up on.
Look delicious.
Can I have one?
Of course.
Looks nice.
Oh, no. You're imagining.
You are.
We have poor imaginations.
You sinned?
It was a laugh. I ate at
the Kamehachi last night.
A boy who sat beside me
asked me for a date.
He invited me to a hotel.
I had a few drinks.
I went to a hotel with him.
He was...
a masochist.
He asked me to tie him
and step on him.
He cried like a fur seal.
He believed to the last
I was a girl.
But I pity a boy like him.
Bad boy.
Good night.
Wait, Eddie.
What do you think?
Do you think
I don't know anything?
Badger!
Skunk!
Thief!
Stupid!
Ass!
Fairy!
Whore!
Lmpotent!
Shit!
XXXX!
How dare you!
Get out!
Damn you!
Behind the masks,
faces suffer loneliness,
People try to escape...,
It's you, Eddie.
Eddie! Come on!
I warned you, didn't I?
Don't cry. This'll be all.
Will I be cured soon?
Of course.
They're just scratches.
Will you celebrate my birthday?
Let's go to the lmperial Hotel
and have a big party.
No. In my apartment,
just two of us.
I'll decorate my room with flowers.
Roses, of course.
I'll light up candles, too.
It'll be wonderful.
I'm scared.
Everything is dim.
Outlines are always changing.
I reach for something,
but the next moment I see nothing.
Not only you.
Can't I see it
though it is there?
Or is it gone?
Suppose it isn't there.
From the beginning?
Yes. Like a mirage.
What can I believe?
I don't know.
Strange.
What is?
I think I saw it before.
But it's impossible, right?
Strange!
Something's wrong with me.
Can that happen?
Watch out! Don't run.
"Return of a Father"
"The day I was born,
perish and disappear! "
..., it may affect young
people badly.
Police headquarters
started today....
..., an investigation into
drug smuggling,
I should say
the counterplan is too late.
News commentary is over now.
It's Leda.
No.
Yes.
Don't look back.
Did she follow us?
Nonsense!
Scum!
I'm funny today.
You're tired.
I feel "life" has left me
behind long, long ago.
"A man spends most of his
lifetime walking."
"But he isn't always a walker."
"It is possible that a man..."
"who walks little and
hates to walk..."
"and never is good at walking,"
"is a walker beyond doubt."
Le Cregio, a writer, said so.
Bad boy.
No!
Don't! Don't!
Don't!
Don't! Don't!
Don't!
"The road to sanctity is narrow,"
Cut!
What do you think
about the hero?
He and I have something
in common.
He parts with his father
as a child.
His way of living resembles mine.
His character, too.
His character?
Do you sympathize with him?
In his way of living, yes.
But not in incest or
things like that.
But I understand him.
How did the role attract you?
This is my first movie
and I'm interested.
My circumstances are like his.
That's one reason.
And the gay life is
portrayed beautifully.
The love scenes?
It's up to the director.
You know her?
Only by sight.
She doesn't know me.
That's better.
What'll you give?
Be sure it's her face.
Who's there?
What's wrong?
The police are after me.
You're bleeding. Come here.
I'm sorry.
Go to a hospital.
Did it hurt?
No. I was excited.
You're lucky
your injury isn't serious.
Thank you.
Why run riot?
To topple national authorities.
Still that doesn't justify violence.
What matters is not
admission of violence...
but progressiveness
of your violence.
And whether the violence
will stop...
or will last forever.
In order to decide don't judge
crimes by morality...
which people call pure morality
by mistake.
Place crimes in logic and dynamics...
and in history, where they belong.
I'm late. I must be going.
Sorry to trouble you.
That's all right.
You're late.
I'm sorry.
You came very early.
She amazes me.
Hello. I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting.
Thank you. It's over now.
Thanks to you,
I have a good appetite.
What are you looking at?
Looking for trouble?
You, fags.
What did you say?
Fags?!
You are Fags, aren't you?
Common girls!
Common?!
Men don't care for common girls.
Dare you call us common?
I'll show you something.
You see? Now, beat them!
Welcome home. How are they?
Terrible!
Aren't they hurt?
Eddie, either?
I don't want to lose her.
No kidding!
Stop acting.
What did you ask Osumi?
She confessed.
Did you think your lousy
trick would work?
Please listen to me.
Shut up!
I see. You mean you love
me that much?
Or you mean you love...
the mastership of the
Genet Bar, not me?
You're cruel.
Don't cry. No tears for me.
No thank you.
"Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who is the fairest of all?"
What a laugh!
You're old.
Your day is done.
Just like that?
You can't blackmail me.
There's no evidence.
Take your time and look for it.
"The sun.
The decapitated head."
Are you alone?
No.
Welcome. Come in.
You like Akihiro Maruyama?
I like Carusel Maki.
Me, Maruyama.
Why?
Because Maki is a transsexual...
I'm sorry.
How is your movie going?
Only a few more shots.
It's your first movie.
Interesting?
I don't know.
It's unique anyway.
"Acclamation Requested!"
Leda?
Funny.
Juju sent for her.
She's late.
Can we meet again?
I can't tell.
Vietnam is at war.
Eddie.
Juju is on the phone.
Hello. It's me.
What?
Roses were her favorite flowers.
They had to be artificial too.
Thank you.
Thank you. Come this way.
The land around here is sinking.
True! Look at that.
They're dipping!
I wish the whole country
would sink underwater.
"The world is reaching its end."
Guevara.
What're you thinking?
About the exit.
What exit?
"Now, from the open ceiling..."
"roses are falling
one after another."
"Spring! Oh, unhappy spring!"
Leave it there.
Eddie... I mean Madame.
It sounds funny.
Why?
This one?
Let me see.
At the corner.
Mister.
Throw this away.
Goodbye.
Good luck.
Drop in here again.
Madame.
Can I leave it here?
Yes.
What is your biggest dream?
What do you want to do?
Well, I want to have savings.
I think I'll run a shop.
A "gay bar?"
Possibly.
You'll live as a queen
all your life?
Yes.
Don't you think about marriage?
I do, but I won't get married.
I can't.
I can't be a "man."
What do you want to
do in the future?
Nothing particular.
Nothing.
Nothing at all?
No dreams?
I'm what I am.
Are you happy living
as a queen?
I'm content.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
No ideas?
Are you haappy now?
Not very.
No? Why don't you
stop being a queen?
No reason.
"Return of a Father"
Why don't you take a bath?
What is it?
Frightening!
Cursed destiny of the man.
What a composite of
cruelty and laughter!
Let's look forward to the
next program. Goodbye.
