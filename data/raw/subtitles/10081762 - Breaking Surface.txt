Mom!
Help!
Is Tuva here?
Is Tuva here?
Where is Tuva?
-Is Tuva here? Where is she?
-I don't know.
We were going to swim under the jetty.
Tuva, I'm here
Cone on. Come on.
Come on, Tuva!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on now!
Tuva...
Ida, you were supposed
to look after her.
You were supposed
to look after her!
If she dies,
you'll be responsible!
Mom?
Sweety, it is in the middle of the night.
You have to sleep now.
-Are you going to swim?
-I'm going to dive.
-With Tuva and Grandma.
-Will you be wearing socks?
Of course.
Otherwise my feet will get cold.
But they're rubber socks.
When you're older,
you can come too.
Where will we live when you
and Dad get divorced?
-Who says we're getting divorced?
-Eric said so.
That's why Dad sleeps
in the other room.
We're not getting divorced.
Everything will be fine,
I promise.
Here. What kind of thermo kit
are you wearing?
A warm one.
It's 90 degrees in here already.
You won't need all this
in the Philippines.
Four months of easy money.
Right?
You guys are crazy
doing this all winter.
One last ice bath then!
Main propeller is okay.
Small tears on one and three.
Not bad.
Okay, move to the bow thrusters.
On my way.
I'm there.
-Confirm all engines are stopped.
-Yeah, all engines are stopped.
Diver in the tube.
How does it look?
The usual crap.
Rope, nets...
It'll take me 15 minutes.
It's really cold here.
I should have worn
the other thermo kit.
Weren't you thinking
you'd be warm?
In four days time...
...you'll be doing this yourself.
Surface?
Surface.
The propeller moved.
Does the bridge know I'm here?
-Is it the current doing anything?
-There's no damn current here!
The propeller moved.
It was mechanical.
Engine running!
Engine running!
Tuva!
-Stop it!
-Let me go!
It's nobody's fault!
Tuva! Tuva!
-Let me go!
-Tuva!
Ida!
-Hi.
-Hi!
Early start?
Not when you have kids.
What's with your hand?
It's nothing.
We'll get your bags.
Mom's waiting.
Mom!
Hi, Tuva!
Hi!
-Hi, Ida!
-Hi.
Hi, darling!
You have to come
visit me more often.
Knut! Knut!
Knut!
So nice to have
both of you here for once.
We'll spend the weekend together,
go diving--
be out in nature,
allow the mind to relax...
How are the kids, Ida?
Good. They're getting older.
And Einar?
It...
It's good.
We're in counseling.
Is that something
your father suggested?
I'm asking because
that's what he always wanted for us.
Therapy, therapy...
Until the end of time.
God, You can't sit in a room
and talk yourself into loving someone.
It's either there or it isn't!
And if it isn't there...
Ida, don't be like your father,
just letting things fall apart.
We'll keep up the therapy.
No one will come and help you,
if that's what you think.
Who would that be?
And don't tell me
you're doing it for the kids.
Ida, I don't want to fight with you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to be like this.
You can't go diving with that cough.
A cup of tea
and some sleep will fix it.
And we'll make it a quiet evening.
Why are you knocking?
What's up?
In the car today...
Well, she can't take her medicine
before diving.
Without it, she goes a little...
Never mind.
-You're much better with her than I am.
-More practice maybe...
Don't let it get to you.
I was thinking, after the dive,
maybe you could
come back with me to Sweden.
The kids, they really miss you.
I'm... I'm going to the Philippines
on Tuesday.
-Another time.
-But...
Good night.
Good night.
...beginning of the day.
Later on rain or snow
with poor visibility.
Minus five degrees...
A hot bath is all she's diving into today.
What the hell are you doing?
Mom will lose it
if she finds out I'm smoking.
-How long have you been doing that?
-This is the second dog.
Wanna go?
Hey!
Wake up.
Look.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Flat tire?
-Yes, but a tow truck is on the way.
-Do you have a spare?
-The tow truck will be here any time now.
-We can't leave you with a flat tire.
-No, but they're on the way.
Could you open this?
But, Tuva,
she wants to wait.
Magic!
Yup...
Hi there.
-Are you friends?
-Sisters.
Or half-sisters...
Mom liked to go
on diving trips alone.
Tuva, you can stop now.
They're here.
Damn it.
Come on, Knut.
This feels familiar.
From what I remember,
mom parked down there.
Yup, it seems you and mom
do a lot of things together
Are you pouting or diving?
Here.
Knut!
The company overstocks
these and nobody takes inventory.
Did you steal them?
Wireless communication.
It's been a while
since I did full mask...
Come on, grumpy.
It's easy.
Knut!
Come here. Sit.
Sit.
Come here.
Knut, come here.
Hey, where's your phone?
Check the battery and reception.
I have 80% battery power
and three bars.
Okay, we have a satellite phone too.
Shit!
We'd better move our gear
under the overhang.
Yes...
Okay, 46 feet straight down here,
around the point
is the entry to the swim-through.
This should be open.
The swim-through ascends to 16 feet.
That's our safety stop.
-Okay?
-Okay.
Diver One connected.
If something goes south...
Ida, are you with me?
Yes, coming.
This is a little scary.
Don't worry.
It'll open up further on.
One tight spot,
then it gets wider.
Tuva, wait,
let me catch up.
This is exactly
where mom and I were.
Just a little further.
Tight spot...
Okay, this is it.
Stop here.
I want to show you something.
Release some air.
Why?
Why do you always
have to be so difficult. Just...
Stop! Get off my stuff!
Do what I say,
release some air.
Good. That's enough.
Come on.
Don't breathe here.
You'll get CO2 poisoning!
Relax. It's like a dive bell.
We can be here for a little while.
Check this out.
Mom ruined my diver's knife doing this.
It was the first thing
I ever bought with my own money.
I loved that knife.
What is it?
-Nothing.
-Stop mumbling and pouting!
It's so fucking obvious
that you and mom shared so much
and I was never allowed in.
-It's even carved in stone.
-Oh give it up, Ida, will you?
-Did I choose that? Is it my fault?
-No, but you know what?
No, but you know what?
This is what happens
when parents split up
and people take sides.
Just like what's about to happen
to my family.
And there's not a goddamn thing
I can do about it!
-Get it? It's happening again!
-Stop it! Stop.
What's going on?
You said things were going well.
It's not good at all.
I'm cold.
Ida...
How much air do you have left?
Twelve bars.
-That's a bit low. Are you cold?
-Of course I'm cold.
Three minutes safety stop,
then we go up.
Ida, look!
Wow!
They're not dangerous,
just curious.
Answer them.
They're talking to you.
-What happened? Why did they leave?
-You never know...
Watch out!
Damn it!
Are you all right?
That hurt!
Screw the safety stop.
Let's go up.
Tuva!
Tuva!
Tuva!
Get back, get back.
Get back!
Tuva! Tuva!
I'm coming, Tuva!
Tuva!
Tuva!
I'm stuck!
I'm stuck!
Shine your flashlight.
I need to see where you are!
Shine your light up.
Ida, stop.
I can't see you!
Shut up!
We need to keep calm now.
Understand?
Okay.
What's your depth?
-72 feet.
-Okay, listen.
I'm stuck.
Keep calm, save your air.
-Get to the bottom.
-Okay.
Okay.
One thing at a time now.
Right now you just need
to get to the bottom.
Just keep going.
Close to the wall I think.
I'm down.
Good. What's your depth?
108 feet!
Tuva, we have to get out of here.
Don't worry, there are margins.
Shine your flashlight, 360 degrees.
Where?
Can you see me?
No. The line for your marker-buoy
is in your leg pocket.
Yeah, I think so...
I have it.
Tie it to something where you are.
Ida, we have to work fast.
You need to find me
before you run out of air.
Okay.
Swim 66 feet.
In what direction?
It doesn't matter. Left.
Tuva, can't you get out?
No, I'm completely stuck, but I'm lucky.
I could have been crushed.
Tuva, you have to try to get out.
It's impossible.
I swam 66 feet. I can't...
-I can't see you.
-Okay, turn around.
-Tie the line off.
-Yes.
Don't get lost now.
You have to be quick.
I can't be far away now.
Keep going.
Tuva, I can't see anything.
-There are just rocks everywhere.
-How much air do you have?
-35 bars. I'm almost out.
-Okay... Easy.
Breathe slowly.
Save your air.
You have to find me
before it runs out.
Okay.
Ida!
Ida, I can see the light
from your flashlight. Keep going!
There!
There you are!
I can see you, Ida.
-Take it easy now!
-No, no, no, no!
-Oh my God!
-Ida! Ida, listen to me!
We have to move
the rock out of the way.
Ida, stop it! Listen to me!
The rock won't budge.
-We have to move it.
-Take it easy.
Take it easy!
We have to get you out, Tuva!
Push! Push!
Listen to me, you can't move it!
Easy, just go easy.
Ida, hold it together.
We have things to do here.
We have to get you out.
We have to get you out, Tuva!
-One thing at a time. Okay?
-Okay.
You'll find glow sticks
in my leg pocket.
You need to mark this spot.
Then go up to the surface
and call for help.
Then make one more dive
and bring me extra air.
There are two tanks at base.
Attach the line to the marker buoy
and secure it close to me.
Okay.
Fill the buoy with air
so that it floats to the surface.
Do a direct ascent immediately.
No safety stop.
When you're up just call for help.
-Ida?
-Yes.
You can do this.
All you need to do is call for help.
I'll be fine.
To the surface now. Go!
Ida, your dive computer will tell you
to do a safety stop.
-Just ignore it, there are margins.
-There's the alarm!
Ignore it. You can do a longer stop
on the next dive.
Get up there and call for help. Now!
Everything will be fine.
Okay, I'm going up.
Okay.
No, no, no... Fuck!
The rock slide struck up here too.
Phones, air-- it's all destroyed.
-Can you move the rock?
-You don't get it. Everything's gone.
Tuva!
Go to the car.
There are two air tanks in the car.
But the car keys are under the rock!
What do I do?
Just smash a window!
The trunk.
Get the car jack from the trunk!
Ida, set your timer for 15 minutes.
You can use the car jack
to lift the rock. Go, now!
The trunk, the trunk, the trunk...
What...
Trunk... no, no, no!
Damn it!
No...
God damn it!
Fuck! Fuck!
Oh my God!
Help!
Help!
House, house...
There.
There... One mile.
-Tuva, I'm here.
-Do you have the stuff?
Not the car jack.
I couldn't get into the trunk.
What about the air?
Do you have it?
Help!
-Tuva!
-Ida, what are you doing?
-I'm almost out of air!
-Tuva, there was an airplane!
There was an airplane!
I don't know if it saw me.
Ida, you have to get down.
-I'm almost out of air.
-The airplane!
It´s back!
Damn it! The emergency flare!
Light your emergency flare!
I don't have it.
I used it already.
Listen! My air gauge is at zero.
I'm out of air any second.
Tuva, the airplane is turning.
It spotted me!
Tuva!
Diver disconnected.
Tuva! 30 seconds. I'm coming!
Tuva! I'm coming!
Can you hear me?
Hold on, Tuva! I'm almost there.
Okay?
I dropped the other air tank
when I signaled the airplane.
I have to find it.
I'll leave my air with you.
Okay?
I couldn't find the way back.
I couldn't find you...
I'll hook your mask up
to the new air tank.
We have to hurry.
The airplane is up there.
It works.
Tuva, the airplane is up there.
It saw me when I was in the water.
I have to get back up there again.
Tuva, we have to hurry.
Okay, up now!
Go!
Up!
Ida, this time you have to
do a safety stop.
Why?
I was only down for a few minutes.
Tuva, I have to get up to the airplane
before it leaves.
We can't wait.
No, you have to stop at 10 feet.
Okay, I'm at 10 feet.
How long do I have to stop for?
Damn it, this is way off the charts...
I don't know.
The airplane is up there.
Ida, I don't know what will happen
if you don't stop.
You said there were margins.
I have to get up there now!
Ida! Stop!
-No, no, no, no!
-What is it?
Damn it!
The airplane is gone.
What do we do now?
Tuva?
Tuva, what do we do now?
You need to go back to the car
and get the jack.
I can't get into the trunk.
But there's a house on the map.
No, you have to lift the rock
with the car jack.
No! The The house is better.
I can get help.
Ida, no one is coming to help us.
Get the jack from the car.
Okay.
Shut up, Knut!
Shut up!
Hello?
Hello?
Damn.
Doggy?
Hey, buddy!
Easy now. Easy!
Easy...
Fuck!
Oh, no! My suit...
Skype, Skype, Skype...
Skype.
Connect to Eyvind's mobile.
Connect.
Eyvind's mobile.
God damn it!
Damn!
Cheap-ass Norwegians.
Where the hell is the jack?
Fix-a-flat.
Sticky tape...
Okay...
Okay. Okay.
-Tuva.
-Ida.
Tuva, there was no jack in the car.
But I found a lever.
I'll try using it to lift the rock.
Just get me out, it's freezing cold.
-Did you change tanks?
-Yes.
There's some left in my old tank.
This tank is almost full.
Tuva, this is what we have.
-We'll move the rock with it, Okay?
-Okay.
Okay, just get me out.
Okay.
Ready, Tuva!
Push! Push!
-Is it moving?
-No.
-I'm using too much air.
-How much?
-20 bars. Let's try one more time.
-Okay.
Okay, Tuva.
One. Two.
Again!
Push, Tuva! Push!
-Is it moving?
-Not a bit.
Tuva, I need more time.
I have to switch to the other tank.
What's wrong?
-Damn it. The valve won't open.
-Is it stuck?
I dropped the tank.
I never checked the valve.
It must have broken.
-Is it not moving?
-It's just spinning without resistance.
Damn it!
Breathe slowly.
How much air do you have?
I have three,
maybe four minutes left.
Okay, one more time with the lever.
Find a new spot.
Okay.
Ready, Tuva?
You have to push.
Push!
Again, come on!
Push, Tuva!
No, no, no, no!
Your BCD!
Push it under the rock
and fill it with air.
-I'm almost out of air!
-Don't talk. Just do it!
-The safety valve is opening!
-Try to block it!
I can't do it....
Damn!
It doesn't work.
Block it!
I can't.
I'm almost out of air.
You have to choose.
I can stay here...
...and breathe from your air.
Or I can do a free ascent.
Maybe someone...
You can't do that.
You can't do a free ascent.
You'll die.
You have maybe 15 minutes left.
Help might come...
No, Ida,
it's not going to happen.
When your air is out
you have to take mine...
...so you can live.
Please, just stay until it's over.
Zero.
It's okay.
I'm so sorry that mom
is not here with you.
I want it to be you.
Take the air!
Are you giving up too?
You need to decompress.
You have too many dives in your system.
-I'm sorry I left you.
-Ida, stop it!
You've done too many ascents.
If you go to the surface now you'll die
before we get you
to a pressure chamber.
-How did you feel after your last ascent?
-Not so good.
How do you feel now?
Any pain in your joints?
In my shoulder and arm.
You have to stay here
for 30 minutes at least.
-That's all we have.
-Stay as long as you can.
Then get to the surface.
I'll wait for you there and pull you out.
Monitor yourself for CO2 poisoning.
Count backwards or something.
Okay, I'll see you up there.
I'll see you soon.
I can shuttle air from the surface.
-It will give you a little extra time.
-Wait, wait!
We have air!
The broken air tank at the bottom,
it's almost full.
We just need to break it open.
In here, right?
60 seconds!
...four, five...
...seven, eight...
We have to do this now.
The air is getting bad here.
We did it!
Ida.
Ida.
Ida?
Ida. Ida!
