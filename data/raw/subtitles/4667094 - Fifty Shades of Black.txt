Subrip:
Pix
Hey, sir... Come back!
Wait!
I've gotta get out of here.
Boo, boo, boo,
hey, hey, hey.
-Girl, you got that list of questions?
-Yes.
I think I have
everything that I need.
Be happy you ain't
got this chlamydia.
Girl, I tried
to take a piss earlier.
It was like there was
an angry dragon inside
my snatch, like some
Game of Thrones shit!
That's terrible, Kateesha.
I can't help it when a
tall, athletic brother
come pushing up
on this thickness.
Yeah... Shit.
God, girl, I thank God
every motherfuckin' day
that the Supersonics
moved to Oklahoma... Shit.
Okay, um, I'm gonna go so I won't
be late for your interview.
What the fuck
are you wearing, girl?
There ain't no camouflage, no
fishnets and no fluorescent colors.
How they gonna see
you in the dark, bitch?
How they gonna see you?
I gotta go.
So big.
I'm sorry.
If you're looking for the homeless
shelter, it's two doors down.
No, I'm...
I'm Hannah Steale.
I'm here to...
To see Mr. Black.
The college bitch.
May I take your coat?
Yes, please. Thank you.
Ew.
Follow me.
In case you're wondering, I'm the hot
secretary who's fucking the boss,
which means there's no room
for the dopey intern
with the damaged hair
and the cankles.
Come here.
That's the smell of his balls after
lunch and two games of racquetball.
Have a nice day,
Miss Steale.
Plain-ass bitch.
My leg.
You.
Shit!
I guess
I should've tried pulling.
Miss Kavahellnah.
Christian Black.
Are you okay?
Um, I think so, yeah.
Good, 'cause you
got fucked up!
You hit that statue
like a hard-charging rhino.
I say rhino because you're a
lot fatter than I thought,
and you got this bump on your
nose that resembles a small horn.
-Um...
-May wanna get that squeezed.
-Okay.
-A little Proactiv on that.
I'm... I'm not
Miss Kavahellnah.
You ain't Miss Kavahellnah?
Who the fuck are you?
My name is Hannah Steale.
I'm studying literature with
Kateesha at the university.
Please, have a seat.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
No.
No.
So, what do you want?
Jesus Christ!
Just spit it out!
A pencil.
"A pencil." Should've just
said that in the beginning.
Gosh. Here, take 'em.
Jesus!
Thank you.
You gotta get your shit
together, Miss Steale.
Shit.
These are
Kateesha's questions. Okay?
"You have mad stacks of cash.
How'd you get it,
and can I get some?"
Miss Steale.
I got my money the way most
black entrepreneurs got theirs.
-Real estate?
-Drug dealing.
See, you have to know your
business inside and out.
I smoked crack.
Not for long.
But just long enough to know
what a penis tastes like.
Tastes like
raw rump roast.
Ew.
I got all ashy, like E.T.
when he was sick in the river.
I lost
six essential teeth.
Have you ever tried
to eat steak with one molar?
No. Why would I do that?
Gnaw and suck.
Gnaw and suck.
It's hard.
Um, could be
that you're lucky.
No. Keanu Reeves is lucky.
Flo Rida is lucky.
Iggy Azalea is lucky.
Yeah, he's lucky.
Next question.
"Is you gay, or is you
gay as a motherfucker?"
Just because you touch a penis
doesn't mean you're gay.
Especially if it's
for money or crack.
You're only gay
if you enjoy touching penis.
You touch a penis with attitude
like, "I don't really like this."
That ain't gay.
It's just exploratory.
You said
you're an English major.
Was it Chaucer,
Shelley or Keats
that first made you fall
in love with literature?
It was Seuss.
Seuss!
Cat in the Hat.
Thing 1 and...
Thing 2!
I mean,
who doesn't wanna be them?
Me and my brother were Thing 1 and
Thing 2 for Halloween this year.
Really?
Yeah. Check this out.
My God, look at both of you!
We called 'em
Thang 1 and Thang 2.
That's amazing.
What if I wanted
to hire you?
I don't... I don't know.
I... I see the way the women dress
around here. I don't exactly fit in.
You know, despite
the Salvation Army sweater,
the greasy weaves
and your big ol' Usher nose,
there's something
oddly attractive about you.
Yeah, you're like
the little ugly runt
in a litter
full of pretty puppies,
the little ugly one
that nobody wants to touch.
You're all hairless and
big-eyed and wild-looking.
But you just wanna take you
home and give you love
or stuff you in a sack
with a bunch of rocks
and just toss your
ugly ass at the bottom
of the ocean, just put
you out your misery.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Black.
Please, call me Christian.
Christian.
I hope I answered
all your questions.
You certainly did.
-Hannah.
-Christian.
Shit! God!
Jesus Christ!
God, make it stop!
White girls,
get that elevator fixed.
Hannah!
So, how was he?
Um, he was
all right, I guess.
Shit! You fucked him, girl!
I knew that shit!
Yeah, girl, get that dick, girl!
Get that dick!
What?
Get that dick!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Take it to town, motherfucker.
Get that dick! Yeah!
Yeah!
Shit, girl, yeah!
-So, did he have a big dick?
-What?
Girl,
was it like real skinny, girl?
Or was it like real long,
like skinny-long?
'Cause that's fucking weird.
But, like,
short and thick, girl...
I can get down
with that short, fat dick.
No, there is... there's
no... there's no dick.
Remember what I told you, okay?
If it's got red zit-like
things on the head
of that shit, you
put that in your butt.
He gon' be like, "Girl,
no, it's just skin tags."
"Bitch, you got 47 skin tags
on your dick?
I ain't falling for that shit.
Again. Okay?"
But you gotta admit, girl,
he is bangin'!
Yeah, I guess if you're
into the wildly successful,
super-handsome,
possibly dangerous thing,
then Christian Black
is your guy.
Bitch, I'm talkin'
'bout Lil Weezy!
Girl!
He got tats on his tats!
And he ain't afraid
to get a bitch pregnant.
Let you keep the baby
and everythin'.
-You gon' eat that?
-Um...
I wish I could find a man
the size of this to satisfy me.
This shit
better be gluten-free.
Mr. Black.
God.
God. Christian.
My God.
You know what I want to do?!
Hi.
What the fuck?
What a pleasant surprise,
Miss Steale.
Please, call me Hannah.
Okay, Miss Steale.
I was just in the area and
wanted to pick up a few items.
Um, are you stalking me,
Mr. Black?
Yes.
I mean, unless you
don't want me to.
You do want me to,
don't you?
Just something
to think about.
Um, can I help you
with something?
Yes. I would like to pick up
some cable ties and some tape.
Well, you're in luck. We got
some cable ties right here.
What color do you want?
Red.
The color of passion.
The tape is this way.
Follow me.
If I didn't know better, I might
mistake you for a serial killer.
Don't be ridiculous.
If I was a serial killer,
I'd need rope, ax, lye, ammonia,
chlorophyll, wood chipper,
plastic sheets
and three large boxes
of space Pampers.
And a shovel.
Second thought,
I think I need to pick up
a few more items.
Well, looks like
you're all set now.
Thank you, Miss Steale.
Hey, if your roommate needs
a photo to go with the story,
I'll be around tomorrow and the
next day and the day after that.
I'm actually around
all next week.
Here. Just contact me.
"Christian Black.
I'm not a bidness-man,
I'm a bidness... man."
Thank you so much
for your help, Miss Steale.
Let me know when those space
Pampers come in, okay?
Save me three boxes.
Got a long drive ahead of me.
Bye! I'm gonna call you.
-Jesse!
-Hey.
Thank you so much
for doing this last minute.
Hannah, listen.
You are my best friend, okay?
You know I'd do anything
for you, right?
Yeah.
-I'd really love a hand job though.
-What?
I said, I really love this job.
It's amazing.
My God.
Get in here.
Later I wanna hit it.
I... Um, I-I didn't catch
the last thing.
I said,
later I wanna hit the bar.
Come on, Hannah.
It's what platonic friends do.
You know?
Grab a beer, right?
Then you make out and have sex
until we question the status
of our friendship, you know?
I guess.
Yeah. Come here.
Hannah!
Did you just kiss me
on my lips?
-Wait. I thought that...
-No. Listen. Let's get one thing clear.
We are just friends.
Don't make it weird.
No, I thought...
-It's okay. I'll fuck you later.
-Wait. What?
I said, I'll see you later.
Geez.
Just go ahead.
Pow! Pow!
Girl, he's Santa.
You like some real fear-type
shit right now, girl.
He look like Marky Mark after he left
the Funky Bunch and started acting.
All right, give me a smile.
Cheese.
All right, don't ever
fucking smile again. Okay?
He asked me to go to coffee
with him after the shoot.
Girl, that's cute!
Last time I went to coffee, I got
eaten out outside a McDonalds.
That McCafe menu
got a girl gushin'.
All right,
let's break the Internet.
Eat.
I'm not your dog. You
can't tell me what to do.
You're right. If you were
my dog, I would do this.
Bad girl!
Bad, bad, bad girl!
So tell me
about your family.
Well...
My dad left me
when I was two years old,
so I was mostly raised
by my stepdad, Ron.
That is painfully uninteresting.
How about your mother?
She's been married
eight times.
She's an incurable romantic.
Are you a romantic?
Um, I guess.
I mean, I like long walks
on the beach.
I like baby talk.
I like to cuddle.
And I love
Nicholas Sparks movies.
Even the one
with Miley Cyrus?
That's my favorite one.
Bitch, I'm out.
-Cheers.
-Yeah.
That taste like
a white boy on spring break.
I hate him.
I'm gonna call him.
-You want another drink?
-Yes.
Drink to forget.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
That tastes horrible.
The Molly must not be crushed up all
the way. Let me fix it for you.
I gotta go
to the bathroom.
You gotta what?
I gotta go
to the ladies room.
I have to take a shit!
Hannah, you feeling all right?
A little woozy perhaps?
Unable to make
good decisions?
We should take it to the
next level and suck my dick.
Take it to the next level,
you stop feeling sick. Okay?
My God.
You are my bestest friend.
Yes. With benefits.
Fuck my mouth
with your fingers.
Fuck!
I'm never
gonna get none.
I'll fuck you.
I ain't gonna like it,
but I'll do it.
Listen, I don't fuck
white girls, okay?
Nigga, who you callin' white?
She just call me
the "N" word?
That kinda
turned me on.
Call me "nigga" again.
Well, hello there.
Yeah, this is Hannah.
Hannah, are you wasted?
Yes, I am wasted,
you hole-ass.
You are "might" on the "roney,"
you penis-suck of yours.
You sound like Yoda.
Listen, I want you
to go home right now.
Don't tell me what to do,
Mr. "-Let's-Go-For-Coffee-
No-Stay-Away-From-Me."
Let me put this in words
you can understand.
Now right home you go.
No!
I told him.
Bitch,
you smell like shit.
Hannah. Hannah, hey, it's cold out
here. You can't come out like that.
Thank you.
How you feelin'?
Just a little bit drunk.
Are you like Donald Trump
running for president drunk?
Or like Donald Trump saying
he don't like mexicans drunk?
'Cause that's some crazy shit.
A lot of Mexicans out there just
crossing the border and shit.
Show them niggas love!
Show them niggas love!
Can I show you some love?
What? No!
Come on. Come on!
Just one kiss, man! I don't know
when you gonna be this drunk again.
Come on. Give me that kiss!
No. No.
Stop!
She said no!
Christian!
You just push me, nigga?
You got some crazy shit
comin', boy.
-Wait. Hold up. This nigga comin' ba...
-Comin' to you, nigga.
He comin' back!
Damn!
Christian, stay down!
Okay. Okay.
The nigga's a ninja!
This nigga's a ninja...
WorldStar!
Bitch.
He had such a beautiful face.
Did he leave?
You better run!
I don't feel
so good, Christian.
Come on. Let's get you home.
No, I can't with you because,
um, my roommate is in there.
Don't worry.
She's being well taken care of.
What's your name again?
My name is Eli.
My friends call me Weekday.
I'm Christian's brother.
The poor one.
I know
what you're saying.
"He's financially poor,
yet spiritually rich."
Nah, that don't count.
What do you feel?
What do you feel?
My God.
When does that end?
My God!
The weight of my penis makes my
money too heavy to carry around.
Yes!
I see you later on.
Until we meet again.
How can I touch you?
I mean, get in touch with you.
My number... is seven.
That's a good number.
God.
I'm-a call you!
Good morning.
I've been staring at you all night.
I haven't blinked once.
Gosh, my eyes are hurting.
How did I get here?
I brought you here, Hannah.
Did you undress me?
I sure did.
My God, we didn't...
No, we didn't.
And I have the blue balls
to prove it.
Look at these things.
What are those?
What the fuck are those?
It hurts so much.
I don't know what to do.
Why are you showing me this?
I ordered you
some breakfast.
Here. Eat.
You'll need
your strength.
But you licked this one and did all
sorts of other weird stuff to it.
Can I get a fresh one?
Maybe some jam.
No. Eat it.
Why don't you just
leave me alone, Christian?
Because I'm incapable
of leaving you alone.
I'm a certified stalker.
I have four restraining orders and
I'm currently working on a fifth.
Listen to me.
I don't do
the romance thing.
Anal, yes.
Fisting, sure.
Two in the pink,
one in the stink. Yeah.
I do that.
But I don't do romance.
You know, I'd like
to bite that lip.
I wish you would.
My God!
No!
Come on.
Let's get you
out of here.
God,
that made me wet.
I love it.
Fuck the bullshit.
How you doin'?
Open your eyes.
Lizard kiss. Come on.
Vampire bite!
I love it!
Yes! Yes!
My God!
You shut up and watch.
Get outta here.
Excuse me.
I have to warn you,
elevators make me horny.
Daddy, I want you
to write a song about me.
I wanna be your muse.
This is a great time.
I'm inspired to write
a song about you right now.
That feels so good.
Deeper, Daddy! Deeper!
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
I think you going platinum
in about two minutes!
That like an E minor
or something?
Shit.
Motherfucker!
You done?
I gotta get to church.
Hey! You two are fuckin'.
Hey, brah.
My brother. My brother.
Peace and blessings.
How you doin'?
Hannah, this is
my little brother, Eli.
-Little?
-Yes.
I'm Eli, like the movie about
the book, because I'm deep.
-He is deep.
-Yes.
-Balls deep.
-Yeah.
Kateesha told me a lot about you.
Yeah, you're, like...
You're, like, a lot plainer
than I thought you would be.
Well, she's plain
but pretty.
You're like a brick wall.
Just boring and rigid.
-Okay!
-And just ashy in some places.
Okay, okay, enough
with the small talk.
-We have a long drive ahead of us.
-We do.
A pleasure.
It's been a pleasure.
The moon shall rise again.
That's so romantic, boo.
What that mean?
Deuces, bitch.
Okay, I got you!
I see you later!
Nice meeting you.
Bye.
All right, so listen.
Meet me at the office later.
I have something special
planned for you. Okay?
-Deuces, bitch.
-Who you calling a bitch?
Shit!
Damn, girl.
I was just saying... He did it to her.
I thought it was cute.
Damn, bitch.
I mean, girl.
Are you ready for the
ride of your life?
My God! Are we gonna
go in your helicopter?
I can't believe you thought I was
gonna take you on the chopper.
We haven't even fucked yet.
After you.
Holy shit. You live here?
What, a black man can't have
a nice place like this?
No, a black man cannot have
a beautiful place like this.
Wesley Snipes had a place like this
before he stopped doing his own taxes.
How about some wine?
Yes, please.
Okay.
Do you know why
I brought you here, Hannah?
I'm assuming
to make sweet love.
I don't make love. I fuck.
Hard and quick.
Really quick.
It's like a Ronda Rousey fight.
You blink and it's over.
O-Okay.
But first you're gonna have to
sign a nondisclosure agreement.
What's that?
It's basically lawyer talk
for "shut the fuck up."
Come with me.
I'll explain.
A nondisclosure agreement protects
both you and me, but mostly me.
Behind this door
is my playroom.
You mean like for your
PlayStation and stuff?
That's a nice key.
So tight.
Get it open.
Come on. Open.
You ready to get open?
I'm an Xbox man myself.
-You next, Black.
-You don't want none of this.
When you done
with Wendy Williams there,
jump on this game so I can
shoot you in the face.
I'm gonna be honest with you,
Christian. She's not attractive.
The bitch look like
she got lupus.
Well, you look like a thumb that's
been yanked out of somebody's asshole.
-Slam dunk!
-That's crazy. That's crazy.
Yeah?
Well, how 'bout...!
-I got nothing.
-'Cause I'm better than you.
Okay, well, I got something
I really wanna show you.
My God. It's not more
broke niggas, is it?
-No more broke niggas.
-No offense.
Don't worry about those
ingrown hairs on your penis.
We can't see them
through your pants.
Don't give her all the dick, bro.
She don't deserve it.
-Half the dick.
-Over there fuckin' Charles Barkley.
Fuck this shit. I'm out.
Please, Miss Steale.
Just keep an open mind.
Tantalizing.
Got these from my grandma.
You're
a sick motherfucker.
No, Bill Cosby's a sick motherfucker.
I'm just a dominant.
What does that have
to do with me?
I want you to give yourself
to me sexually.
Hence all the whips,
chains and freaky sex toys.
And what would
I get out of it?
Me.
My God!
Let me get this straight.
So, you wanna beat me
with these paddles...
-Whip.
-Whips.
You wanna chain me
to this rack...
Handcuff.
And humiliate me
in unimaginable ways,
and in exchange
for all of this torture,
I get you.
Yeah, that's correct.
And women go for this.
Some women.
It's like Disneyland
for grown-ups.
Yeah. So what do you think?
I'm pretty much cool
with anything,
as long as you promise you won't
tell my dad I fucked a black guy.
So what do you think?
Two things. Where is the cup
and when do we eat shit?
What we supposed
to do in here?
Well, I thought we'd start
with a little bit of rope play.
No!
Okay, well, how about I just mount you
to that rack over there and spank you?
Hell to the no.
Perhaps a little bit
of flogging?
I don't even know what
the hell flogging means,
so fuck to the no.
Okay, well, what are we
supposed to do then?
You need to find Jesus.
That's what you can do.
Okay, here's how it goes.
I've drafted a standard contract
that lays out the terms.
Lots of sex.
We have more sex.
Yada yada, we end with sex.
You look it over and you negotiate
what you're willing to do.
I hate to, um, throw a monkey
wrench into the whole works here,
but... I...
You have low self-esteem?
No. I...
You have daddy issues.
No.
What I'm trying to tell
you is, I'm... I'm a...
A virgin?
Yeah.
Man!
I can't believe this.
I don't understand.
Okay, tell me
you've done something.
-Blow job?
-Where does the blowing come in?
-Finger pop?
-No.
-Angry Panda?
-Why is it angry?
Why did you ask that?
My God. Okay, tell
me you've done anal.
I know how it goes. You let guys put
it in your little rusty bullet hole
so you can tell your mama and your
pastor that you're still a virgin.
I've just been waiting.
For what? Girl, you are
20-something years old.
It don't get no better.
It's going to spoil.
It's fermenting down there.
Just fermenting. Okay?
You gonna tell me
nobody wanted the pussy?
Well, I just am very selective
about who I wanted to...
Selective?
That sound like something somebody with
a pussy that nobody wanted would say.
Hey.
Don't get me wrong.
I don't want it all worn out
like a old washing machine belt
or hanging like wet straps
in a car wash
or flapping around like an inflatable
figure outside of a mattress store.
But I want it to have
some experience.
Okay, look, we're gonna fix
this situation right now.
I've been waiting
my whole life for this.
Come on then.
Yes.
Very...
Very Sasquatch of you.
Have you never had sex
with a virgin before?
Not a hairy one.
You nicked me.
What the heck?
Yeah. I have an outie.
That got flavor.
-What?
-You're the first person who's seen it.
Little Eskimo kisses?
Noo-noo-noo-noo.
I never had anyone
do that to it before.
Watch the teeth!
Sorry.
Got him.
Okay.
Sorry.
-I didn't have time to shower.
-Shit!
Okay. You ready?
I'm gonna take you
to a whole nother galaxy!
My God, I'm coming!
God!
Got it. Got it.
Got it. Got it!
-Whoo!
-Already?
-That was amazing.
-Really?
I guess I was expecting
something... different.
Don't worry about it. It's your
first time. Don't sweat it.
You'll get better with experience.
Just keep working on it.
You know, it's customary for a woman
to make a man an oversized sandwich
to help him regain
his strength.
Either that or some leftover
pizza or maybe a Hot Pocket.
You want me to make
a Hot Pocket now?
I don't make the rules.
I'm just telling you.
You got a lot
to learn, kid.
Are you asleep already?
Nigga!
Christian?
-Christian!
-Shit!
-Who the fuck is that?
-My mother.
Great. Now I gotta get rid
of two crazy bitches. Fuck.
Mother.
Christian.
Hello.
You better get dressed or we're
going to be late for the regatta.
I forgot that was today.
-You're not doing crack again, are you?
-No, Mother.
I never raised you
that way.
However, it is a prominent trait
in your genealogical pool.
Hello.
I'm standing my ground!
I'm standing my ground!
Shit!
Mother, what are you doing?
That's Hannah Steale.
How many times I gotta tell you?
Black lives matter.
Come on. Let's get you up.
Hannah,
this is my mother, Claire.
I am so sorry, Hannah.
My, you have
beautiful breasts.
I would've thought
they'd be more droopy,
like a sock
with a rock in the toe,
like in those
National Geographic magazines.
You're gonna have to forgive
my mother's behavior.
Sometimes she can be factually
inaccurate and quite racist.
Do not apologize
for me, Christian.
I am your mother and I love you
like you were my own white child.
But I still hide my wallet
at night, just in case.
As you should, Mother.
It is awesome to meet you.
Are you two dating?
No, Mother,
we're not dating.
We're just fucking. Hard.
And quick.
Apparently, it's the best way.
Well, I just can't tell you how
pleased I am to meet you, Hannah.
I mean, you're the first woman
I've seen Christian with.
I-I assumed
that he was...
What would Oprah say?
Um, on the DL?
-Christian, you can do so much better.
-Mother.
You're one of the richest, most
handsome men in the world.
You could date white women,
like Tiger Woods and Seal.
Okay, it's time
for you to go, Mother.
Or like Taye Diggs
or Quincy Jones.
Or even Ice-T.
Um, Hannah?
Christian's Chinese sister,
Mai, has come to town,
so we're gonna hide the cats and
have the family over for dinner.
-You should come.
-I'd be delighted.
-It was really nice to meet you.
-Okay, great. Time to go, Mom.
Where is my wallet?
Still there.
-You just never know.
-Yeah.
They're delicious.
All right.
We had breakfast.
Time to go.
Look. Your Uber's here.
All right.
Okay. What?
Spit it out.
Well, how did you get into this
whole dominant-submissive thing?
It was one of my mother's really
close friends, and my music teacher.
I was 16.
She was older.
Don't look so nervous,
Christian.
All I ask is that you do
your very best.
Um, I-I thought I was supposed
to be here for music lessons.
Baby, you are.
And... your lesson
starts right here.
Hey, hey. Snap.
We got a regular
John Holmes here,
without the big dick
and the stamina.
Okay. Again!
One, two, three!
Do you know why I hit you
with that tambourine, Black?
I have no idea.
Were you rushing
or were you dragging?
I thought I was fucking.
That wasn't fucking!
Now, count off.
One, two...
Was I rushing
or was I dragging?
Answer the question!
You were rushing!
Is that a tear?
Poor little guy.
Are you upset?
I'm upset.
You worthless, adopted,
unloved little piece of shit.
Weeping and slobbering over my
vagina like a nine-year-old girl.
Now, for the last father-fucking time,
say it louder so I can hear it!
I'm upset!
Black,
get off the bed!
-You make me sick.
-But I'm upset.
Get off the bed.
You're not ready for this.
I'm ready!
Willy?
Willy, you're up next.
Willy?
You better get your
shit together, Black.
You're not gonna amount to
anything, sexually or musically.
And you know what the biggest
disappointment of all is to me?
I thought all you black men
had rhythm and a big dick.
Boy, was I mistaken.
I have rhythm!
You're all set, Miss Steale.
Courtesy of Mr. Black.
What the heck?
What is that? Is that a drone?
All right, just sign here.
Thank you very much.
Girl,
another gift?
Damn, you must be
giving that bomb head!
Wait a minute. Is that a
retina display MacBook Pro?
-Bitch, you lickin' out butthole!
-I didn't lick a butthole.
Shit, you lucky, girl.
I licked six buttholes
last week.
I got a Dell.
Desktop.
I can't take that shit anywhere, girl.
That mail come already?
No. It's this weird sex contract
Christian wants me to sign.
You sign that, but then you get
that paper, boo. All right?
A bitch gotta get hers.
You keep licking
that booty, okay?
We're done?
-What?
-Yeah, I read your text.
"Face,
sparkly diamond, poop"?
What does that even mean? You got
me all fucked up with your emojis.
-Hey, how did you get in here?
-Does it matter?
Yes, actually, it does
matter, because you
don't live here and
you don't have a key.
You don't need a key
to get in a hamper, Hannah.
Here, now, help me
outta here.
You're lucky I wasn't in your
medicine cabinet or your jewelry box.
I tried to hide
in your nightstand,
but you had this Gideon Bible
in there and I couldn't fit.
Wait a minute. Did you break
in through that window?
This one? No.
That could've been anybody.
The brick on the ground says,
"Property of Christian Black."
"Christian..."
Yeah, yeah, I-it does.
But I mean, that could belong to any
black Christian, right? I mean... Okay.
Enough...
with the interrogation.
Come here.
Do not... move,
or I'll be forced to punish you.
I said, don't move.
Okay.
That feels weird.
What is that?
So hairy.
Yeah! Yes!
Wait, wait, wait. Don't move.
Don't, don't... Don't.
Damn it, that shit was cold!
-Are you ready, Miss Steale?
-Yes, Christian.
You brought a condom, right?
A... a condom?
-Yeah.
-O-Okay.
Yeah, of course... of course I got
a condom. Hold on one second.
Goddamn it.
Just knowing you care enough
to use protection excites me.
Aha. Old trusty-dusty.
"March, 1982"?
Hell no.
Yeah, I got one right here.
I found it.
Here, let me open it up
so you can hear it.
Okay.
I'm just gonna scoot these
little bad boys to the side.
And then I'm gonna
park this right there.
My God,
it feels so natural.
It's like you're not
wearing anything at all.
It's lambskin foreskin.
J-just relax.
No, not you. I'm talking to myself.
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
Okay?
Ready?
That was like two strokes!
This nigga's back here
settin' records!
They gonna put me
on a Wheaties box!
-Thank God you're wearing a condom.
-I know.
'Cause, boy, we wouldn't want
to get you pregnant, right?
I know. I'm not even taking any
birth control. And I'm ovulating.
Did I tell you that
twins run in my family?
Twins?
My sister had sextuplets.
Sextup...
Really?
Let me just get
an after-sex mint.
Here. H-Here.
Have one of these.
Here you go.
Yeah.
It tastes weird.
All gone?!
Good girl.
Shall we begin,
Miss Steale?
Page one, paragraph one.
This must change.
There's a typo in the header.
-That's it?
-Mr. Black.
I will end this negotiation
right now.
My apologies.
Page four, section 13.20.
-With regards to anal fisting...
-Is... Is there a problem?
Absolutely not.
And strike out vaginal fisting.
If you're gonna do anal, you're
obviously gonna have vaginal fisting.
-I mean, it's a given.
-For sure. I will put that...
I'm putting that
in there in bold.
Next page, sex toys.
"Are they acceptable
to the submissive?"
Dildos. I guess.
-Butt plugs, fine.
-Fuck yeah.
How did this slip through the cracks?
What's with the genital clamps?
Sorry, Miss Steale. I can't
seem to find those in my...
Because you forgot
to put them in there.
Rookie move, Mr. Black.
Silly me.
Let's be clear.
I will not share you
with another woman.
-I require at least two or three.
-Five.
-Seven.
-Seven it is.
You're not gonna shortchange me, Mr.
Black.
You drive a hard bargain,
Miss Steale.
Thank you.
Miss Steale, I'd like to fuck you
into the middle of next month.
Silly.
You couldn't fuck me into the
middle of the next minute.
I'll fuck you
into a different galaxy.
You'll be, "Shit,
it's cold in Pluto!"
Yeah, well, I'm gonna fuck you
at the Stephen Hawking exhibit
and I'm gonna ram
your ass so hard that
I cause a tear in the
time-space continuum.
I'll fuck you through slavery times,
and you'll get your freedom papers.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
rent me a DeLorean
and fuck you back to the future.
I'll fuck you into a
whole nother planet,
where that insect
is from Men in Black.
You'd be like, "Shit.
How many times you fuck me?"
Three million,
746 hundred million times.
You'd be like, "Why?"
I'd be like, "Shut up."
And I hit you
with the neuron, like...
You'd be like,
"My God.
Why is my vagina so sore?"
And I'd be like,
"You fell."
Well played, Mr. Black.
I've done this before.
And he's a major beneficiary
of our university.
Interestingly enough,
he donates all cash.
Usually in ones, fives, 20s.
The odd rolled-up $100 bill that's
got a little bit of powder on it.
Please welcome
Mr. Christian Black.
You tellin' all my business?
Don't get cut.
Thank you. Let's talk about
life and your purpose.
You all spent four hard years in
this school getting your diploma,
putting your parents in debt.
For what?
Between global warming
and the world economy crashing,
I don't even know why you're
trying to better yourselves.
Give up hope.
Think about it.
You are wasting time.
You. You're a drug addict
waiting to happen.
Look at you. You can't wait to get
outta here and smoke some weed.
And you, you are a stripper.
Your ass is twerkin'
as I'm sitting here talking.
You can find
a rhythm in anything.
And you, sir...
Well, you're white.
You'll be fine.
So, in closing,
I would like to say,
"Thank God I'm not you."
Kateesha!
-Girl!
-My God, we did it!
I'm so proud of you.
Who you tellin'?
I was close, girl.
I was one hand job away
from losing "valevictorian"
to that bitch,
Lindsey Hung, right?
-What are you talking...
-Shut up.
I see that bitch.
She talkin' shit.
She gonna need a gynecologist when
I'm done fucking that bitch up.
All right. Girl, I see you later.
I'm-a go punch a bitch in the throat.
Lindsey!
You bilingual bitch!
So proud of you.
Hannah!
Dad!
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm so proud of you.
You know, I thought you'd
turn out not to be shit.
But you end up looking real good,
being that you from a drunken whore.
Yeah.
Yeah, your mama's
over at the rehab.
Twenty-seven times
is a fucking charm.
-Isn't it?
-Yeah, it's a fucking charm.
-Hey, where are my other stepdads?
-Right over there.
Jonny Quest, B.B. King.
I don't know who that nigga
is with their shirt off.
That must be your birth daddy.
Yeah, it's all good.
What a great bunch of guys.
And you know the old saying...
"It takes a village."
And that's true, especially when it
comes to your mom being a gutter slut
and the village is a gang bang.
"The village is a gang bang."
Hannah!
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hey, hey, hey,
hold up, playa!
Shit, how you gonna walk up
and kiss the girl that I raised?
What kind of shit is this?
Ron, this is my boyfriend,
Christian Black.
Boyfriend?
Ron, to be honest with you,
I just fucked her a few times.
"Boyfriend" makes it
sound serious, like...
like I went raw. I might've
dipped, but...
-Are you thinkin' about marrying her?
-No.
-What if she get pregnant?
-Still no.
But hell no.
I like this mother!
-I like this nigga right here.
-I fucks with your stepdad.
You know what? From playa to playa,
Black, I really like you, man.
You can fuck anybody you
wanna fuck, you hear me?
Thank you.
Just don't pass her around
like we did her mama.
-That's all I ask you to do.
-Yes, sir.
We passed your mama around
like a baton, man. Yeah.
Yeah.
You never told me that
about your mother.
Your mother fucked everybody
in the neighborhood,
then wanted to settle down
with me, and I went for it.
I gotta hang out with
you, man, get your
knowledge, 'cause you
got a lot of wisdom.
I got a lot of wisdom
and I been through a lot.
I done been with a lot of hos.
-Yes.
-And the smells that's on my fingers...
-Shit!
-Over all the years...
-What?!
-Still has never went away.
Damn! Sir!
-I smell every last single one of 'em.
-Yes, man.
It was like beautiful and
horrible at the same time.
Yes, I've stuck my hands
in some of the nastiest
-bitches' pants all over the world.
-Have you?
Really?
Asia, Malaysia, Congo.
That's Dubai
right there.
I smell the hair.
Touched a bitch booty hole
in Dubai at the airport.
I bet you could probably
spit a lot of game to me.
Let me get a picture
of me and you.
No, no, baby. Just me and him.
Ready? One, two, three.
Niggas!
Where are we going?
-Congratulations, Hannah.
-That's a car.
With a broken window.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
It's... nice.
You know what I went through
to steal this car?
I mean,
the car was a steal.
-Did you just roll your eyes at me?
-No.
Listen, there's only
two things I hate...
When you roll your eyes
at me and Craisins.
Like, what is a Craisin?
It's not a cranberry.
It's not a raisin.
Like, it doesn't
even make sense.
You just rolled
your eyes at me again.
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.
I have it on tape. Check this out.
Look at this.
What she doing? She's rolling her eye.
Look at that.
How did you do that?
Come on.
You, with me, now.
Teach you a little lesson about
rolling your eyes. Come on.
Now, do you know why
I'm gonna punish you?
Because you're a sicko
who likes abusing women.
While there may be some truth
to that, that's not the reason.
Because I rolled my eyes.
Bingo.
This is gonna hurt you a whole lot
more than it's gonna hurt me.
Welcome to my world.
God!
Fuck!
-That hurt!
-Did you do it?
Okay, 15 across...
"Winter beverage."
Nothing? You don't feel nothing?
I love knitting.
Aaah.
Are you gonna spank me? All
this buildup is getting boring.
Okay, okay, you wanna play? I got
something for you. Excuse me.
Enough of your games.
-It's about to get real dark in here.
-Sure.
Are you gonna find something
that actually works?
Big brother almighty!
Whoo!
That was my
sorority paddle!
You know, Hannah...
I didn't wanna have
to do this to you,
but you've been
a naughty girl.
Did you break
my fucking stool?
No.
I think I'm pretty good
at this.
I don't...
I don't understand.
I fucking hit you
with everything.
I don't get it.
Don't feel bad.
I haven't really felt anything down
there since I got my butt implants.
I'll just... I'll see you back
at my place tomorrow. Yeah.
When we are in this room,
you do as I say.
Is that understood?
Yes.
Yes who?
Yes, sir.
Good girl.
Hands up.
Turn around.
On your knees.
Stay.
Don't look at me!
Raise your hand.
-Did that hurt?
-No.
Sometimes the pain
is in your mind.
Goddamn it! Motherfuck!
And sometimes the pain
is not in your mind.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
What a jerk.
Whoo-hoo!
I have a very important question
to ask you, Miss Steale.
-Where is bin Laden?
-What?
Where is bin Laden?
When was the last time
you saw bin Laden?
Where is he?
I don't know!
He's been dead
for five years!
I don't keep up
on current events!
And now
the real torture begins.
Where were we?
I can't remember the safe word.
Chapter 23.
"It was a cold,
gloomy day in Seattle."
God, this book is
50 shades of fucking terrible.
Who wrote this,
a third-grader?
Please go back
to the water torture thing!
-What's your safe word?
-Stop it!
What's your safe word?
I don't know.
Please, just...
Are you gonna let me down now?
Yes, Miss Steale.
If I could just...
find these keys.
You don't see the keys?
No, I know where they are.
I just...
God, my arms are really
starting to hurt.
I got an idea.
See, most people use a universal
lock key in their sex dungeons
for reasons just like this.
But what you got here is an over-molded
swivel key. That's a custom job.
You're gonna need somebody
else to take a look at this.
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell ya.
Next time, I'd put one
of those tracker app
things on the key
so you don't lose it.
-What are they called?
-I know the name.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It starts with a "T."
Maybe T-Temp?
Tele...
-Telepathy?
-Hey, dipshits!
-It's called a Tile.
-Tile! Yeah!
-Holy shit! You're good.
-You went to college! Hell, yeah!
Come on, come on!
I've picked a lot of locks, but
never seen anything like this.
-Man, it's impressive.
-Thank you.
Yeah. I got nothing.
Who's next?
Who's next? What are you
guys, Ocean's Eleven?
How many more fuckups
you gonna bring in here?
Stand back!
On the count of three,
the Great Mysterio
shall command
these shackles unlocked!
One! Do not divert your gaze.
Two! Illusion.
Three! Mysterio!
Thank you.
Yeah, that didn't work.
-All the locks are still there.
-Nothing happened!
-I got nothing, guys.
-God. Jesus Christ.
Speaking of disappearing, I
have a bar mitzvah in one hour.
Mysterio!
Damn!
My God!
This was not in the contract!
Where are we going?
To my parents' house.
For dinner.
-You look lovely.
-Thank you.
Where did you learn to dance?
At this little club in Tampa.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Fuck!
Take it off!
My God.
He's got a baby dick.
It's just the lighting!
It's bad lighting!
It's creating shadow.
It's not little!
You're just little people!
-Hi.
-You made it.
Hannah!
It's so good to see you.
Hi.
Hannah,
this is my dad, Gary.
Are we ever happy
to meet you, Hannah.
-Really?
-Yes.
I was sure
that Christian was gay.
He's well-groomed,
loves Lady Gaga,
can't take his eyes off
of Anderson Cooper.
What kind of Republican
watches CNN?
Hi! I'm Mai.
It's so nice to meet you.
I can't believe
you're a Republican.
That's his deep, dark secret.
Shall we?
-I can't believe you're Republican.
-Sorry.
Mrs. Black,
this food looks amazing.
Thank you, Hannah.
Well, it was important to me
that our adopted children
were exposed to
their native cultures.
So, for Eli,
I have prepared Balangu.
It's a spicy goat dish
from Nigeria.
And for Mai, of course,
we have Peking duck
from the Mandarin province
of China.
-I'm Korean.
-Don't be fresh, Mai.
There are billions
of starving Chinese children
who need their energy
to make sneakers for Nike.
And they would kill
for this meal.
For Christian, of course, we
have fried chicken and Kool-Aid.
It's a very popular dish
in Detroit, Michigan.
And your favorite,
of course... hot sauce.
Mom.
Thank you.
So, Hannah, are you interested
in having children?
Yes, I would,
if I met the right person.
You have no idea what joy we
have had from having our kids.
Mai's the one that I...
I worried about the most.
She was so sweet.
I mean,
it seemed almost inevitable
that she'd grow up one day
and run off with Gary
like that little director fellow... you
know, the one that married Mia Farrow?
Sweetheart, please stop.
She's our daughter.
She is a hot
little number though.
Hannah, I would really recommend
adopting underprivileged children.
That's really just
so sweet of you, Mrs. Black.
It is a great conversation
starter at charities.
-It helps your social standing.
-Give it to me.
And your vag doesn't
get stretched out
like an elastic band
at Cirque du Soleil.
Okay, Mom.
Mom, please.
There is just nothing
I wouldn't do for my children.
I even learned
to speak Mandarin for Mai.
Bang-fung-chow...
-That's not even a real language.
Hit that bottom!
So, Hannah,
where is your family from?
My mom
lives in Georgia.
Atlanta!
Then your mom
must be a stripper.
She actually lives in Savannah,
and she's just a housewife.
Sure she is, dear.
I'm gonna go and visit her,
actually, in a few days.
Drinks anyone? Drinkies?
I'll have two.
I'd love to, Mom, but I promised
Hannah I'd show her the estate.
Homestretch! Yes!
Excuse us, please.
It's grocery time.
It's like
I'm on air right now!
-How come you didn't tell me about her?
-Who, my mom?
My God, she has a nickname?
Do you love her?
Of course.
She's my mother.
God! How... How long
has this been going on?
Since birth.
Come on.
I can't compete with that.
Hey, you don't have to compete with it.
You're my boyfriend, she's my mom.
They're two totally
different relationships.
No, they're not.
Okay, Hannah,
you're mine, okay?
There's no mother, no brother, no
cousins, no second cousin removed,
no friends that you call cousin
'cause your parents are close.
There's none of that.
No play cousins?
No play cousins.
Christian, what do you want?
I want Kevin Hart
not to be in every movie!
Why? He's hilarious.
Come on, there's other black actors.
How about them?
Well, like who?
It could've been Sam
Jackson in Ride Along.
Who knows what kind of crazy
wig he would've been wearing.
I thought you wanted me.
What do you want,
love letters?
Hickeys?
Edible Arrangements?
You know, that's not even real flowers.
It's fucking fruit.
Yeah, but it's delicious.
And it's a start, okay?
And maybe we could advance
to a Tiffany's engagement ring
and a wedding where we invite
500 of our closest friends,
and then we have seven kids,
and we live in a big house...
You had this whole thing
planned out?
You know, is it me
or is it hot in here? Shit.
You want me to be
somebody that I'm not.
No, no, it's not me
that's changing you.
It's you
that's changing me.
Wait a minute. That's a line
from the movie Radio.
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, yeah.
The movie with Cuba
Gooding Jr. where he
played this mentally
disabled athlete.
"It's not us that's teaching Radio.
It's Radio that's teaching us."
Nah,
mine is way different.
It's the same premise.
You complete me?
Jerry Maguire,
also starring Cuba Gooding Jr.
I don't understand
your whole fixation on him.
You know, all this time I thought
I wasn't in the right place,
but I was!
That's Snow Dogs.
Goddamn it! I gotta stop
bingeing on Netflix.
Hannah!
That song sounds so sad.
Not as sad as Luther Vandross's
"Dance With My Father."
God, that song tears me up.
Every time I hear it, I just
wanna go, "Where's my daddy?"
Christian, we have to talk.
You mean
like white people?
What's wrong with that?
Well, they just
talk a lot, you know?
They do it differently
than black people do.
White people don't like to argue.
They like to discuss.
Then they start throwing
around all these big SAT words
and putting a lot of emotional
guilt on each other.
It's just too much to deal with.
I like it the black way.
You know,
where we curse each other out.
We may fight,
and then we get cool again,
but we talk behind
each other's back like,
"No, I ain't fuckin'
with that bitch."
-But what you not gonna do...
-What you not gonna do...
-What you not...
-You not about to "not" me!
Don't let me get
to clappin', boo.
Hell, no.
See? That's...
That's communication.
I feel better already.
Christian.
Hey!
You're not upset because I haven't
signed the contract yet, are you?
I mean, it's not even legally
enforceable. You know that, right?
What's important here
are the rules.
And if you break them,
you should be punished.
How are you gonna punish me?
First off,
you'll get grounded.
I'll make you stand
in a corner for an hour.
Then I will send you to your room
without no supper, young lady.
Christian, this is crazy.
Why do you need to punish me?
Because I'm 51 shades
of fucked up!
You know, I'm five-four
seconds from wildin'.
I got three filets
for fryin'.
I got 99 problems,
but now a bitch is one!
That's a hundred problems,
Hannah.
I can only deal with so much.
Ninety-nine's fine.
A hundred just...
I can't even count that far.
Okay.
Then you show me the worst.
I wanna see how bad it can get.
No more of this pussy-ass punishment
you've been doling out thus far.
I wanna go all the way.
Is that something
that you think you can do?
Yes.
Bend over.
Nothin' says ass whuppin'
like good ol' Joe Jackson.
Hannah?
I'm gonna spank you six times.
I need you to count with me.
Goddamn it, motherfucker!
I said count with me.
One!
Two!
Jesus!
It hurts so bad,
I can't keep count.
-Where were we?
-I don't know.
Goddamn it, Hannah!
I don't know how to count, okay? My
crackhead mother never taught me.
How about this?
Let's try in Spanish.
-Spanish?
-Sí.
Tres.
Cuatro.
I'm not too sure, but I think
cinco comes after tres.
Are you kidding me?
Cuatro comes after tres.
Well, don't get mad at me.
I don't know Spanish.
Look, my crackhead
mother never taught
me how to count or
how to speak spanish.
-Now we gotta start from scratch.
-No!
¡Ay!
Hoo!
Hoo. Whoo!
I am tired.
God, that is exhausting.
I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.
Come on. Let's get you up.
-Don't touch me!
-What... Hey!
Does it make you happy
to see me like this?
I mean, not really.
You look like a sad Gollum.
You's all bent over, and you're crying.
You look a little crazy.
-Come on, don't hate me.
-Hate you?
I loathe you.
That's... that's a thesaurus
word right there.
I hate you the way
black people hate cops.
I hate you the way
Republicans hate Obamacare.
Baby, come on now.
I hate you the way Kanye West
hates everybody else!
Well, I'm kind of with him
on Taylor Swift.
What is that bitch
singin' about?
You will never
do that to me again.
You said it was cool.
I know niggas, grimy niggas
who do not value themselves,
and they will have no problem coming
down here to fuck your little ass up!
Slow it up now.
Just one "Cuckoo!"
And they will swoop down on you
like pigeons on old garlic bread.
You can't be cuckooin'
on this mo'fuck!
You gotta calm them niggas down.
You know what?
Let's try something else.
This is cute.
I get it. A little role play.
It's cute. Handcuffs. All right.
You thought you were gonna
do this shit to me?
You messed with the wrong bitch.
You sound angry.
This is for Kerry Washington
from D-jango Unchained!-!
It's fucking... That is "Django"!
The "D" is silent!
This is for Lupita Nyong'o
in Twelve Years a Slave!
Goddamn it!
It stings so bad.
All she wanted was some soap!
Even antibacterial soap!
-This is for Denzel Washington.
-Wait, he's not even a woman.
-You just getting crazy.
-But they made him cry in Glory.
Who makes Denzel Washington
cry? Nobody!
You talkin' 'bout like this?
See, look. I have a Glory tear.
If it wasn't for
Denzel Washington,
Flight would've been
a fucking Soul Plane!
Shit!
Why the fuck did they make
Soul Plane anyway?
And this is for the little white
girl in Fifty Shades of Grey!
Johnson! Dakota Johnson.
She had to be naked
the whole fucking movie?
That shit was just gratuitous!
Whoo! Yes!
It burns! It burns!
It feels like someone
lit my ass on fire!
God, it hurts!
-We done?
-No, nigga, no. We not finished yet!
We not finished
with you yet, nigga!
What? Where you goin' with this?
I'm about to get
medieval on your ass.
Welcome to my world,
motherfucker.
God!
God!
This hurts so much.
I wish I'd died.
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!
It's tickling.
Christian,
I thought you'd like it.
What's there to like?
What kind of sick pervert
beats you for their
own enjoyment?
Christian, you don't want
somebody like me.
Exactly what I want.
A broke college graduate
with a liberal arts degree
and no future prospects.
That's exactly
what I want.
Christian, I've fallen head
over heels in love with you.
Slow it up.
That is not
in the contract.
Like, it specifically says...
And I quote...
"Bitch don't love a nigga."
Okay?
And I double-bolded that.
I knew I should've
had you sign this contract.
Christian, I think it'd
be best if you leave.
Get out!
Fine. You want me to leave? You want
me to leave? Fine. I will leave!
Okay. Wait. Time-out.
Um, I live here.
Shouldn't you be the one leaving?
Am I wrong?
Take an umbrella 'cause...
Bitch, it's raining.
I need my car back.
I already sold
that piece of shit.
I'll send you
a check for $37.
That is way below Blue Book.
Wait, Hannah.
Christian,
you have to let me go.
-Please, listen to me.
-No, you listen to me.
You'll find someone,
somebody who wants to be open
to all the demeaning things
that you wanna do to them.
-Hannah!
-Christian.
-Ew.
-God!
How is he gonna love you?
He doesn't even love himself!
Did... you... see...
his... haircut, girl?
How could you think
this was gonna end well?
Never look back.
-Christian.
-Hannah.
While running down
47 flights of stairs,
I had plenty of time to think.
And when I passed
out on the 23rd floor,
I realized I owed
you an apology.
I just wanna say I'm sorry
for the way I treated you,
especially for the whole
waterboarding thing.
Turns out, you were right
about bin Laden.
Who knew?
Everyone.
You hurt me, Christian.
I know,
but I have softer whips.
You know the kind
with the pink fur on it?
It takes the sting off.
That's not
what I'm talking about.
You want romance.
I deserve it.
Well, what's more romantic than
running down 47 flights of stairs?
-You know I pulled a hamstring?
-Did you die?
No, but that's gonna keep me out of
the Red Room for at least a week.
-Bye, bitch.
-Okay, okay.
-Hannah, wait, wait. Hannah.
-No, Christian.
You are incapable of having
a normal relationship.
I know,
but I'm trying, okay?
I want to be like that old man
whose wife has Alzheimer's,
and he wakes up every
day and he tells her
the story about
their lives together,
and then they take a nap,
but they don't wake up...
because they're dead.
That's The Notebook.
That's the one with Ryan Gosling and
the girl with the big-ass forehead?
He never forgot her.
You don't even like
Nicholas Sparks movies.
I used to hate them,
but now I love 'em.
Even The Last Song.
Why was that even a movie?
You know that wasn't even a book?
If I'm gonna give you another chance,
things have to be different.
I know.
I have something very important
I wanna tell you.
I lo...
I lo...
I... I...
Ia-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
What I'm trying to say is,
I love...
Empire.
That Cookie just says
the craziest things.
Okay.
I love you.
I knew you loved me.
I have one last surprise for you, but
you're gonna have to pack a bag.
Are we gonna go on your private jet?
My God. What kind of jet is it?
No, don't tell me.
I wanna be surprised.
I can't believe you thought I
would take you on a private jet.
I love you and all, but you
don't even have a ring yet.
Hey, baby,
it ain't no thing, man.
We just out here winning
'cause they losing, man.
They goin' broke tryin' to pay
attention. You know what I mean?
It's what it is.
