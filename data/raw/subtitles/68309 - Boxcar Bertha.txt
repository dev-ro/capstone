(# harmonica blues music)
Hey, come on, Bill.
Keep your eye on the spike.
Spike your ass.
Shit! Here he comes again. Lookee, Von.
Watch your mouth, Bertha. Your daddy
ain't gonna like you talking like that.
(# harmonica music starts again)
Coming in.
- I ain't going back up there.
- You better damn well.
No damn chance, mister.
My plane's got a bad mag drop.
I got a half-dusted crop out there.
I have obligations to my buyers in town.
Von, you got that bottle of Pepsi-Cola?
- That don't include winging my way...
- It means finishing the job.
- What's the matter?
- I tell you what.
When you finish that,
take it to the store and turn it in.
They'll give you two cents for it.
That'll help tide you over till your next job.
Hey, Von, check it out for me, will you?
Why doncha let go, Daddy?
It don't matter. Let him keep his money.
You know I can't do that.
I know.
You maybe could do it.
Don't let it fret you, honey.
I'll bring you a star.
- How'd you get it to shine so?
- What?
(engine splutters and cuts out)
No!
(explosion)
- Son of a bitch. What are you looking at?
- Don't look at me. He was flying too low.
Get your hands off her.
(screams)
(man) You know, I've been hearing
about this thing called the Depression.
That's the word they got for this
empty feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I don't know. Seems to me it's about
the same as it's always been.
I always did have to bust my ass to get
work. Once I got it, I couldn't keep it.
Me and the bosses
never did seem to get along.
You can take it from Big Bill Shelly.
Look around you.
Ain't nobody gonna protect us. Railroad
took it away from us, we gotta get it back.
Organise. Unionise.
You don't expect strikebreakers like
Mclver's there to look out for you, do you?
Well, there's been a lot
of pushing around here.
I say it's time we started pushing back.
Let's hear it. We're gonna bust this
railroad. We're gonna get 'em, right?
We're gonna live like men,
or we ain't gonna live at all.
We're gonna take that Reader Railroad
and smash it. We ain't just playing.
We're gonna take that bastard Mclver and
his friends and grind 'em in the gravel.
Bullshit.
- How'd you get here, honey?
- Boxcar.
Well, I'll be... Hey, you look kinda hungry.
Have you had any dinner?
- I'm as full as can be.
- How about a little dessert?
Just thank God
you came down amongst union men.
Most of these men
been eating wild greens since August.
Violet tops. Weeds like cows eat.
- I want something I ain't ever had.
- How you gonna get that?
- Guts and luck.
- Huh. Luck.
Hell, luck is being
a Vanderbilt or a Carnegie.
Just grab on something good
when it comes by.
Sure enough, honey.
Which way are you headed?
I don't know.
- Watch out for Mr Bells.
- There ain't no rattlers out here now.
You must be careful, anyhow.
Here. I'd carry you across the threshold,
but it's a little high.
Thank you.
Bill, I want to thank you.
You're a real straight shooter.
Whoa, honey.
I'm not that straight a shooter.
Huh?
I mean, you ain't even seen me shoot.
Huh?
I'll at least light a fire for you.
You probably don't even have
any matches, do you?
Well...
Don't do to wear nothing wet
in this weather.
No, I wouldn't.
Get the croup. You ever had the croup?
Once, when Daddy
was dusting in Big Springs.
Hah.
Big Springs, Texas.
I remember when I heard
of Big Springs, Texas.
He was lucky to get out of there alive.
You know that?
I've been lots of places.
You ever been with a man?
- I been with lots of men.
- Goddamn, girl.
I mean like this.
No. I mean I ain't exactly used to that.
I wouldn't let it bother me none.
You get used to it, sooner or later.
(dice rolling)
(man) Ten.
- Craps.
- You lose.
- OK?
- Sure. Put it in.
- Do I do it?
- Yeah, just throw them out.
Not bad, honey. Not bad.
- Do it again?
- Do it again, right.
- She did it again. You win.
- I win?
- Right.
- That's easy.
Yeah. That's easy.
- Wait. Let it ride, he'll fade you.
- What does that mean?
Just leave the money out there
and he'll fade ya.
Fade me?
- Do it again?
- Do it again.
- You did it again.
- You win again.
- (both) It's all yours.
- I'm gonna quit.
- You're not gonna play any more?
- No, I ain't gonna play any more. Mm-mm.
Thank you. I ain't gonna do it any more.
You ain't got much to say
for a gambling man, have you?
Are you mad at me at winning at craps?
You ain't sick or nothin'? Deaf and dumb?
Well, why doncha say somethin'?
You sure look awful silly, sitting there
wagging your head around like that.
- What kind of clothes do you call that?
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- Did you hear that?
- I knew it. He's a Yankee.
- What are you doing in this camp?
- All I got to do is open my mouth and...
Go back where you belong.
You guys are still fighting the Civil War.
We're not all Jews or somethin'.
- Yeah, you are.
- Just go.
(quiet man) He should talk.
He looks like a rabbi.
- You see that?
- You can't go back up North?
I doubt it. You think I'd be here?
- I seen lots of folks worse off than you.
- Yeah?
Why don't you do something
about that problem of yours?
- I can teach you.
- What problem?
- Say after me. De-ah.
- What?
De-yah.
I can't understand what you're saying.
It don't matter if you understand.
Just say after me.
De-yah?
That's pretty good. Now again.
Deyah.
Yeah, that's real good.
That's real good.
You're gonna learn easy, I can tell.
Mah de-yah. My dear?
No.
- Ma de-yah.
- That's good.
Deah, you lookin' lovely.
Thank you, Rake.
- How's the house?
- Money, ma deah.
Some small-town merchant
and a lawyer who works for the railway.
But they got 'em a satchel.
(Bertha) "Make light thy brother's load."
Uh... honey, you ain't planning
on using that, are you?
Use it? What for?
Well, you just be careful
where you're aiming it.
What do you mean?
Nothing, honey.
- Mr Mendares.
- Mendiez.
Rake Brown, the fella
I was telling you about.
- How do?
- From the Louisiana Browns.
Really? You must know some friends
of mine. The Coxes in New Orleans?
(Southern accent) I seldom make it
up there. I like Baton Rouge personally.
It's down.
It's a little south of Baton Rouge.
When we say "up", that's because
we lived on the north side of town.
- This is a friend of mine. Bertha.
- How do?
- How do you do?
- Bertha?
- Oh, can I offer you a cigar?
- Thank you.
Everybody's striking.
East coast, West coast.
What happens if everybody strikes?
Firemen? Police?
You know what that'd mean?
Anarchy. Chaos.
We got a socialist people going on now.
We got Reds coming in, Reds around us.
Reds in Washington goin' down.
What's gonna happen?
What are these Reds?
That's all I ever hear about, is Reds.
Big Bill Shelly. He's a Red.
- Shetley? He's a Bolshevik, too.
- I'll take one, please.
Not Shetley. Shelly.
Shelly.
(Mendiez) But he gonna get his tomorrow.
Cos tomorrow we're gonna get him.
And it'll be one Red less.
You're pretty.
Very pretty.
You have a remarkable figure.
Quite... full.
Thank you.
What colour cards you have there?
Hey, what colour deck
we playing with now?
- What's the matter with you?
- (screams)
Get away from me. If there's anything
I can't stand, it's a cheat.
Anything I can't stand more'n a cheat,
it's a Red.
Anything more'n a cheat and a Red, it's a
man who dresses the way you do. Get up!
- Don't! For God's sake, don't do it.
- Why?
- His family's good name.
- God damn his family's good name.
Get away from him. You're gonna get...
(gunshot)
Get away. Hurry. Come on, hurry.
- (approaching vehicles)
- Sh!
Sh!
(men shouting)
What the hell's going on out there?
Nothing. They're shooting up
some folks across the road.
Must be them strikers.
Bill...
No, Bertha. I'm Rake, remember?
- I gotta go.
- Listen, moron.
That's real guns they're using out there.
Y'understand? We're gonna stay here until
they're finished. Then we can hop a train.
But you're not going out there now
and neither am l.
(shouting and gunfire)
Hey, slow down!
Hey, wait a minute, will ya?
Hey, I'm not good at this running. Bertha!
What are you doing?
Trying to get us killed? Jesus Christ!
I told you I don't do this well.
- (screams)
- I said wait.
What's the matter with... Hey! Bertha!
I'm here. Here I am.
Hey, who is that?
- Hey, what is this?
- This is Bill.
I've known him a while.
Well, you know me a while, too, Toots.
It's not the same.
Not at all.
This is Rake.
Yeah. I'm Rake. That's terrific.
Gambler's luck.
You guys up for a little game of cards?
No?
What a terrific day this is.
Just terrific.
- Hi, Big Bill.
- Hiya, Bertha.
Hey, looks like we're coming into
some kind of big town, huh?
- Looks like Memphis.
- Don't look like Memphis to me.
Well, which one is it?
Is that Memphis?
- Is that Memphis?
- Chicago.
What are you talking about?
Is that Memphis, really?
Wake up.
You ought to get George now,
be ready to go as fast as you can.
We don't want to go
all the way into the yard.
Setup!
It's a goddamn setup.
Hey!
Listen, honey.
We're not gonna clear this one.
Now, you go out
and I'll find you when I shake loose.
No. No!
(Bertha) Oh!
(Rake) I just woke up in this car.
There's these guys.
I didn't even know who they were.
Do you think I'm nuts, hanging around
with a bunch of stiffs like that?
I'm not even from here.
(# harmonica blues music)
(man) See, she's got her skirt
up somewheres around her chin.
I got a clear view up to the old kazoo.
I finally get her home and she says...
I swear to God, she says "Deputy,
I don't know how to thank you."
And I says "Why, honey, I believe you do."
So, I climbed in the back seat there, see.
And she lies back, she puts her legs up,
and she acts just like she was born to it.
(hums blues improvisation)
Hey, nigger.
If you're gonna play, you play "Dixie".
(plays harmonica)
Or shut up.
Full of communists and coons.
(plays "Dixie" slowly)
(stops playing)
Bill.
- How are you?
- (mumbles)
- How you been?
- OK.
- What they do to you?
- (prisoners shout)
Harvey, who is that son of a bitch?
How's that, Sheriff? Which son of a bitch?
The one over there,
shaking hands with that nigger.
It's good to see you.
I didn't expect to see you no more.
That's Big Bill Shelly. Notorious
Bolshevik. We drug him in last evening.
Well, I don't know about no Bolshevik,
but I know he's a nigger lover.
Harvey, go over there and
make a nigger out of that white one.
(thudding and Shelly crying out)
Hold fast there.
(Rake) Hold it a second, huh?
Wait a minute.
How you gonna like it when I choke your
guts out? Huh? How you gonna like that?
You guys. Hey, guys, please.
Please!
Wait a minute. They got guns.
Listen to me, huh?
Oh, my God.
You boys sure made a mess.
Clean it up.
Von) # Ain't no more here about
Ain't no more here about
# Oh, what's it got to matter, baby?
# You won't write to me
You won't write to me
# Oh, what's it got to matter, baby?
You won't write to me
(all) # You won't write to me
Von) # Oh, what's it got to matter, baby?
You won't write to me
- (all) # You won't write to me
- Shut up.
# I ain't all that tired, uh huh
All right, you sons of bitches.
- Shut up.
- (singing continues)
(car approaching)
Keep working, boys.
(tyre popping and gas escaping)
- Can I be of service, ma'am?
- Shit, yes.
I just can't figure out how
to put that thing on that thing.
Well, honey, just leave it to Harvey.
I'm just no damn good
at them mechanical things.
We'll have it in a minute, ma'am.
Good, I got a... a train to catch.
- Where you going, little lady?
- To Africa.
- Africa?
- I'm a missionary.
I've dedicated my life
to the black heathen.
Ain't you afraid those niggers
might... eat you, or something?
Come here, honey.
Come here.
Sit down.
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.
Real wide, now. Now, don't move.
What the hell are you doing, making up
to that guy? Get on over there. Go on.
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.
Come on, Von.
Get in there.
Do it, man. Go.
I'm not meant for this kind of life.
You're used to them regular hours
on the chain gang.
- Have a piece of chicken.
- Y'all wanna go back?
- Hey, turn off that dirt road.
- Huh?
- Turn off.
- This milk gone bad, Bertha.
- It's buttermilk.
- Take the next one.
Now you got us public enemies out,
what are you gonna do?
Or didn't you think about that?
Bet you didn't.
I'll tell you this. I sure would have hated
to wait for you to break me out of jail.
- Ain't you got no bread?
- No.
Well, at least I wouldn't be about to hand
that goddamn deputy my ass on a platter.
- As far as I could tell, he already had it.
- Hey, come on.
- How about that? He sure did.
- Come on. We're on a state highway.
Would you relax, boy?
Hey, is that a cop car?
(mouths)
Don't you go lookin' at him, now, Bertha.
God damn, Bertha.
Couldn't you buy a car that'd run?
- Buy?
- Ah...
- This thing's busted.
- Oh, great. Now we're auto thieves, right?
Let's skip what we are and think about
what we're gonna do. We're in Arkansas.
- Where you going now, Bertha?
- The thing's busted.
- What you gonna do?
- We'll catch the 5.10. Come on, help.
- How far is it?
- Down the road.
What do you mean?
I ain't cut out for this kind of life.
- Son of a bitch.
- Who you callin' a son of a bitch?
Come on.
Hey!
- Hi.
- What happened? We get robbed?
Why? You got something to rob?
Now, four goes into twelve.
It goes three times...
And...
- (Rake) Put all the ones here.
- Well, it goes three times.
(Rake) So that's... uh...
Von) That's three thousand apiece, guys.
(Rake) And now put
the hundreds in this one.
Now the fifties. That's fifty.
That's the ones.
Right, you just get the twenties.
You see, each pile is sorted out.
- Why do I get the twenties?
- That's the system.
- Why do I get them?
- Take any one. There's twenties.
There's the twenties, fifties, hundreds,
ones. Put the ones... That's not twenty.
Hey, let's go.
- You got this thing cut loose?
- Sure enough.
Come on.
- You know how to run this thing?
- All aboard! Roll the train!
(horn)
(conversation drowned out by train)
Wait a minute there, boy. God damn.
This is the first time
the 5.10 has been on time in 40 years.
First time it's been run by a union man.
You done all right with the engine,
but where's the rest of the train?
God damn, old man.
How do you think we got here on time?
Come on, baby.
(sniggering)
- (Bertha) What's so funny?
- (Rake) Listen.
"The notorious labour radical
and Bolshevik spy, Big Bill Shelly,
along with certain of
his desperate confederates,
broke out of Shelby County Penal Farm,
assaulting a guard."
What's so funny about that?
I was laughing at the spy part.
You don't look like no spy to me.
- I always thought they wore glasses.
- (Bertha) What else does it say?
"Assaulting a guard
and stealing a locomotive as he did so."
"ln addition to Shelly, the break-out
freed... one... Rake Brown,
a cardsharp and a pretty...
a petty confidence man,
well known to authorities in this area."
"Brown is not considered dangerous,
as he's known to be a coward,
and lacks the nerve to carry arms."
- I carry arms.
- But you don't use 'em.
That's not the point.
"Along with Brown and Shelly, authorities
claim a woman, Bertha Tomkins..."
- Thompson.
- Thompson. Bertha Thompson...
"..known to be a common whore
and woman of the streets,
also is im... implicated in the escape."
"The Thompson woman is being sought
for her alleged involvement
in the shooting of a prominent attorney."
"lt is reported that all other escapees
have been returned to custody,
except for a Negro."
That's probably you, Von.
- I never reckoned on all this.
- What's this about an attorney shooting?
- That was just a gambling man.
- Shut up.
An accident. And the other stuff's a lie.
Why... we're just criminals.
- I guess that's one way of looking at it.
- Shut up.
- Let's stop all this and head for California.
- No. I ain't no criminal. I'm a union man.
Yeah...
Yeah.
I'm going to take my $3,000
to the union hall.
- What?
- Yep.
- Hey, what about us?
- Bill!
- You go, that's all our asses.
- You can't go to town.
- You go with $3,000, that's all our asses.
- What do you care? It's my share.
They're gonna come back and get us.
Don't you understand?
Why don't you do it some other time? You
expect us to be here when you get back?
- We're not gonna be here. Right, Bertha?
- I'll be here.
I'll be damned. Shelly. They told me you
was dead. They said the sheriff's boys...
You can't believe anything a cop tells you.
Even something good.
Listen, did anyone know
you were coming up this way?
Hell, no. Just my police escort.
Didn't you hear the sirens?
Don't come all smart with me.
They got a price on your head.
You and them nuts you busted out with.
Whores and niggers. My God,
ain't that a nice image for unionism?
Well, here. I reckon
this'll clean up the image some, huh?
It's marked. You know it's marked.
They mark it nowadays.
Tiny little mark. They can tell every bill.
Joe, try not to be no dumber than you was
born to be. It's OK. Hell, it's money.
You're hotter than a deep-bowled stove.
Do us a favour, stay away from here.
The union has got to preserve...
- You don't need my money, you mean?
- I didn't say that.
It's appreciated. It's appreciated.
Look, hitting a scab is one thing.
But robbing the damn mail,
that's something else, ain't it?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Just see that stuff
gets in the strike fund, you hear?
- All you socialist bastards are just alike.
- In the strike fund!
Anything goes.
What are you doing with that dog?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm feedin' it.
Oh.
I had a dog in New York once.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What'd you do? Lose him in a crap game?
No, as a matter of fact
I didn't lose him in a crap game.
He started a union.
Bill?
What?
It's gonna be all right.
Sure. Union don't want me.
Railroad goes on starvin' kids,
bustin' heads, makin' money.
And I'm here.
Bill, to get back at the Reader, you
don't need no union. Ain't that so, Rake?
You don't need no union
to go for more Reader payrolls.
Yeah. Payrolls... ticket offices...
What else we gonna do?
Put an extra $10 in them pay envelopes.
Just keep calm, and keep working.
Don't you do anything funny now.
You wanna just put something
on the tray, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am, that's fine.
That's fine, thank you.
And you, sir, you got
something here for me?
Thank you. Oh, my goodness!
Oh, that's...! Thank you.
Y'all sure was nice to this old nigger.
What you got?
That's a nice-looking watch you got on
there. Uh-huh. Yes, ma'am, all that's good.
All that. Yes, yes.
Thank you. You ain't got nothin' for me?
My goodness. How 'bout you?
You got something for this ol' nigger?
Thank you, I'm doing real well here.
Thank you, that's very kind.
(train whistle)
- What? Some what? Some with what?
- I said I think there's something wrong...
Waah! Hey!
Woohoo! Give me these.
Well, let's don't stop now.
Let's just keep going, huh?
You take care of the others, Rake.
Get over there. Watch it, now.
- OK, now, drop that.
- Move over.
Put 'em down.
I'll just take those, boys.
Y'all get on the floor, fast.
I said hit the ground.
All right, sit down.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Sit down.
Fast.
Now up.
- Fast. Fast.
- Come on, Bertha, get on with it.
Stand up. Up. Up. Down.
Up. Get up.
Down, down, down. Up.
Down, up, down.
Down. Come on, now.
Sit down.
Sit.
Well, how many?
Well, they've got four bosses,
but they got plenty of others.
What about that commie Shelly?
He used to plague me
with wildcat strikes. What about him?
- He gets his orders from abroad.
- Oh, of course.
We got more than
a security problem here.
We know how to handle him
when we get him, don't we?
And it'll be the exception, won't it?
Cos in the words of the Lord "l shall
vomit forth that which is lukewarm."
We know what to do.
Of course. What about the other one,
Brown? What about him?
He'd, uh... He'd crook ya.
You mean he'd try.
Fellas, the way things are,
this railroad's losing money every day.
I'm losing money every day.
You add Bill Shelly to that
and I got myself a situation.
- Ain't there another man with him?
- Nah, just a nigger.
Oh.
Well, what about her? What can you
tell me about this here Boxcar Bertha?
- (man) Aw.
- (woman giggles)
(man laughs)
(both laugh)
What's the matter, honey? You tired?
How could I be tired? I ain't done
an honest day's work in months.
I think it's honest work.
You think it's better to pick up a pay
envelope each week, working for them?
- I don't think that's more honest.
- That's being a slave, and you know it.
I'm just not used to
this kind of life, that's all.
I'd do anything you want.
You wanna quit, we'll quit. We'll go away.
I ain't a quitter.
If you want to leave,
there are no chains on you, honey.
- You're dumb.
- How do you mean?
I ain't leaving.
(Bertha giggles)
(gunshot)
Stay down.
- You see anything?
- No.
God damn.
It's Rake and Von.
Damn.
(laughs)
- Trouble?
- No, ain't no trouble.
What the hell you firing your gun for, with
the sheriff breathing down our necks?
You got to tell us you got
a new pair of shoes or something?
- Yeah, I got new shoes.
- Great.
What else am I going
to do with the dough?
- Anyway, that ain't why I'm shooting.
- Well, what, then?
We got ourselves
a little piece of fortune comin'.
There's a big party
Sartoris is throwing for all his buddies.
- So he's having a party? So what?
- So what?
So everybody from the railroad
will be there. Von, what do you say?
It sounds good. I want to see the look on
their faces when we take them goodies.
What we have here is a trap.
That's what it is, it's a trap.
I'm tellin' ya, it's a good thing. The only
thing is we don't want to go in shooting.
So we gotta come up with something.
- I ain't a criminal, you know.
- It makes me the criminal, right?
Aw, Rake, no, I didn't mean that.
All I mean is...
Listen, if we're going to hit Sartoris, we
gotta hit him so he doesn't get up again.
Damn, you just go for anything.
This ain't no easy war you're figuring on.
Honey, I never thought it was going
to be easy. I never said that, did l?
You're right, though. Bertha, you just
stay here. We'll go on ahead without ya.
Like hell I will.
- Where are you going?
- Trying to get out.
- I go first. Ladies first, remember?
- All right, get out.
Von) Get out the car, Bertha. Come on.
Hurry up, Rake.
- Do I look all right?
- You look great.
But I just saw a guy wearing tails
and I'm wearing a tux.
- Oh, Rake, you're so silly.
- What's so silly?
I'll be the only one in there in a tux.
I'll look like an idiot.
Invitations, please.
Oh, invitations...
- You must have them.
- I don't have it.
- I think I left it on my desk after...
- Henry, you have it.
- I do believe I does have them tickets.
- I think we got them.
- Here they is.
- That ain't it.
- Look again.
- That's it, that's it.
Yeah.
- Come on, Bertha.
- Gimme that gun.
Now, be careful now.
Yes, the Reader Railroad's
seen a great deal in its day.
Wars, strikes, and now,
the indignity of it all,
gangs of communists, whores,
pardon me, ma'am, and niggers.
Nevertheless, at this very moment,
my agents are...
Out cold and tied up in the kitchen.
Up against the wall, ma'am.
How's that feel for you? That's too tight?
Huh? That too tight for you? Uh-huh.
That's good.
Folks, may I have your attention? Folks?
Sh!
The lady would like to say something.
Go ahead, kid.
Thank you.
I'd just like to say that this is a hold-up.
We've come for your money and jewels.
So if you'd line up,
Bill, Rake and Von won't shoot you.
Von) Come on, move over there.
Come on, move it over there.
Come on, hurry.
Hey, you.
You there, with what
you think is a cuspidor.
"Lay not up for yourselves
treasure on earth."
"Where thieves break through and steal."
- I see you sorta know your Bible.
- What do you mean, sorta?
You forgot something.
The passage goes "Lay not up
for yourselves treasures on earth,
where moth and rust doth corrupt, and
where thieves break through and steal."
"But lay yourselves up
treasures in heaven."
- This here's my Bible.
- Mm.
- (Shelly) That's real pretty, honey.
- Can't stick it in.
- Hey, Von.
- Mm-hm?
Here, pick that up.
Just put it in here, sir. Pick that up.
- Put it in here, son.
- Pick that up.
Pick it up.
Not my tiara.
Aw, it ain't so special.
I got even better ones at home.
Come on, Bertha, let's get going.
- Oh, ma deah Bill...
- Cut it out, now.
You're Bill Shelly.
I had a sort of respect for you.
I thought you were
some sort of crazy Bolshevik.
But hell, you're just a common crook.
You just don't understand.
Here, I don't want your watch.
I don't want to steal your watch.
I just want to smash your railroad.
Let's git.
OK, just stay where you are.
Just stay where you are. That's it.
(train whistle)
I'm taking this to Washington. We'll see
what the FBl has to say about all this.
Thank you, boy.
Now, I expect if J Edgar
don't do something mighty fast,
I just might have to have a talk with FDR.
Yes, sir.
That's a joke, son.
- Hi.
- Son of a bitch, you're coming with us.
A couple of your buddies
are going to pay $100,000 for you.
Von) Mm-hm.
Now, how you gonna like that?
Sure enough.
(gun clicks)
Drop it, Billy boy.
Don't make me do what I want to do.
I believe I could use a drink, boy.
No, God damn it, not again!
Rake!
- I'm gonna help him.
- Hold it, Shelly.
I'm gonna help him.
Run, Bertha!
God damn that bitch.
That damn bitch.
Cover Shelly, I'll get her.
God damn.
(whistle)
(door opening)
(creaking)
Are you sporting, baby?
Do I look like I'm sporting?
Well, I just...
- Sister, what have you been drinking?
- Not a thing.
Well, move on, or I'll have to take you in.
I wouldn't want that to happen.
You keep that mouth shut, you hear?
You dumb son of a bitch, you know better
than to talk to that guard like that.
It hurts when you laugh, huh?
You're gonna get out of here some day.
Maybe.
You'll make it.
There's something you could do for me.
If you could find Bertha...
Tell her I'm not gonna see her again...
cos I'm finished.
You might...
You might tell her I love her.
She knows you love her, Bill.
You won't need to warn her.
She'll be around, if she's around.
(woman) Honey?
Do you have a place to stay?
No, ma'am, I ain't.
- I just made this town.
- Well, you come along with me.
I got a place where you can clean up,
get some rest.
(plays "Turkish Dance" by Mozart)
- How long's this gonna go on for?
- (man) Now, stop talking and watch this.
Can't nobody show you this but me.
(man) How about that?
I don't know the end of what that bastard
can do. When he gets drunk enough...
- That's disgusting.
- Y'all watch this, y'hear?
Ain't nothing to it.
- Tastes great this way.
- Stop it. You're gonna hurt yourself.
Naw, not me.
- Now, watch this.
- (man) Mrs Mailler.
Mrs Mailler, Mrs Mailler,
he's doing it again.
Mrs Mailler. Mrs Mailler.
Oh.
- It's OK. Come on in.
- No, I'll see you later.
- What's...
- Oh, pay no attention to that man.
Are your parents alive?
Are you a cop?
No, no.
As Mrs Mailler explained downstairs,
I'm an anthropologist.
- Your parents, are they alive?
- You sure you're not a cop?
- Positive.
- You wouldn't lie?
No.
- Now, uh, your parents?
- No.
They're not? Good.
Now, have you been in love before?
Sure. I'm in love now.
He's one of the local boys here in town?
No.
I see. Did you go
to church much as a child?
No.
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.
- It shows.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Um... was your mother a whore?
- No. Was your mother a whore?
- No, no.
Uh...
What are the areas
that you find have the maximum...
maximum erogenous,
uh... stimulation, like...
- All over.
- Here?
That's...
that's $2 if you want to touch me.
- Fine. How about down...
- It's $10 below there.
Well, now...
All right.
You can put away your pencil now.
Sorry.
If I give you $1 5, can I stay?
I don't want to sleep alone tonight.
Sure.
See you later, sugar.
We'd better git if we're going.
We'd never have a day off
if they had their way.
They'd just keep on working us to death.
Ah, Tillie, look at the baby doll.
Daddy gave me one like that once.
- She lost her head.
- Probably over some no-good man.
(# blues harmonica improvisation)
(noisy conversation and blues music)
Bertha.
Bertha, I'm so glad to see you.
- How you been?
- How is he? Von, Von, how is he?
Well, last I heard,
he wasn't doing too good.
He broke out of jail about a month ago.
Didn't you hear nothing about it?
- He's out?
- Yeah.
No, I hadn't heard.
I ain't read a paper in months.
Bertha, sit down. Sit down.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm so glad to see you.
I've wondered what you been doing.
Von, you know what I've been doing?
Don't tell me nothin',
'less I ask you about it.
Well, Bill's got to know.
I guess you been doin' just about
the best you know how, Bertha.
- Where is he? I got to go to him.
- That's easy enough.
Did I see some railroad tracks
just down the street?
- There's tracks, OK.
- Well...
was you in need of a week to pack
or what? Come on, girl.
(whistle)
Von) Well, we got him this house.
He don't sleep much at all now.
So let's walk kind of easy. I don't want
to come up on him all of a sudden.
Bill.
Hey, Bill.
You in there?
Who's there?
Let me hear you.
Who's there?
Me, Bill. It's Von.
(Bertha sobs)
Damn. I'm lovely, ain't l?
I always was.
You look just the same.
The fighting's really over for you now,
huh?
Hell, no, not till I'm dead.
You don't have to rush it.
It is appointed each man to die...
till Judgment.
You don't have to rush it.
Honey, they've hurt you so much.
Let's get out of here.
I want to take care of you.
Say, Mac, what do you think
we ought to do with this here fella?
(screams)
Bill!
No.
Don't take him.
Don't take him.
Don't take him.
Stop it.
No, don't take him.
Don't... take him.
No.
No.
No.
