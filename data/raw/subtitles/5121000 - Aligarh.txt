I‘m frustrated.
‘Tasneem‘ wont let me touch her
You must relax or

She says she wont
entertain ‘Little Johny‘
Do I have to marry for that?
Oh, she‘

 entertain ‘Little Johny‘.
All girls want it!
No. This girl isn‘t like that.
Listen. ‘Sakeena‘ was
once at the college fee counter
Said to the collector ‘Sir,
take mine, take it quickly‘
The guy got excited, said ‘wait
2 minutes, 
‘

 take it properly‘
An impatient ‘Sakeena‘ said
‘Sir, take it quickly
or my period will begin!‘
Wake up ‘Little Johny‘
So they‘re still at it, eh?
Move quickly.
Anuj.
- Hmmm.
Who do I talk to
for a news source in Aligarh?
- The PTI correspondent.
Do you have the number?
- Why?
I want to talk to
him about this story.
Your job is to select stories,

Did you have to break
my conversation for that?
Some TV journalists barged
into a professofs home, in A
igarh..
..and they filmed him having
sex with a rickshaw-puller.
Okay.
Give it to Arpit,

The University suspended

What do you think this is?

Good morning Deepu.
This isn‘t a hammock, ifs my desk.
You want my feedback?
What if I say no?
Your article feels like some gay-rights
protest statement, not a story.
Too bad your opinion
has never mattered.
Karan.
- Take your feet off my desk.
Namita.
Namita.
I need conveyance to go to Aligarh.
Deepu, I can‘t send you without

He doesn‘t come here anymore.
Since when?
Since the scandal.
He did come once.
He packed his stuff and left.
Where can we find him now?
- I don‘t know.
She doesn‘t know anything.
Why is the department so empty?
Who cares about regional
languages around here?
We hardly get 2-3 students a year.

Sir, sir...on

You think his suspension is justified?
- I don‘t want to talk to the media.
Sir, pleaseml want to help him.

t‘s best you don‘t help him.
This matter has already escalated
out of control.
But, sir, there was no action taken against
the two who conducted the sting operation.
Don‘t you think he‘s being victimized?
I request you,
please don‘t pursue him..
"otherwise he won‘t
have any place to even hide.
Please understand.
Excuse me...sorry.
Thank you, sir.
Later we‘

Cheapo, you‘

Deepu smile!
His house is completely locked
Looks like Siras has fled.
No, look the lights are on.
So what?
He musfve left the
lights on and fled.
He must be somewhere nearby.

See you day after.
Bye.
The University is charge-sheeting"
..Prof. Srinivas Siras for the incident
that took place on 8th February.
His immoral conduct..
..is unbecoming of a teacher
at Aligarh University (AU).
Prof. Siras will be
sent a legal notice today.
And he‘

 have to vacate
his allotted quarters.
..21 Medical Co
ony..
..within 7 days.
(OIS) Sir, can you tell us who the
other person with Prof. Siras was?
But, sir...what about the
two people who made this tape?
I mean...was there no
action taken against them?
No.
- But why?
Because they are not our employees!
But isn‘t it true that..
..this videotape was made
without Prof. Siras‘ permission?
You think this is funny?
A journalist is asking
me this question?
Do you take permission before
shoving your cameras anywhere?
Remember,
the issue here isn‘t the camera...
The issue is its content.
Whafs the reason
behind leaking this tape?
No more questions!
Well done.
Thank you.
No other reporter wou
d‘ve
raised this question.

t‘s my job.
Do I know you?
Tahir Islam, Philosophy Department.
Deepu Sebastian,
from Indian Post Newspaper.
Siras is a good friend of mine.
lam glad he has a friend.
You cannot disconnect my electricity.
This notice clearly states
that I have seven days.
You‘

 get electricity
for only 4 hours.
From 7am to 11am.
You cannot disconnect e
ectricity..
"as long as l‘m still living here.
I will lodge a complaint
with the police.
Go ahead, go to the police.
ls it done?
- Yes.
How about we settle this some
other way? Give me some more time.
What time did you say?
7am to 11am.
My father was a professor at AU.
I studied at Oxford.
But I came back here to teach..
..because of what
the University stood for.
What exactly did it stand for?
After the Mughal ru
e..
..it was the Aligarh University
that shaped..
..the outlook of the Muslims.
It imparted a...
A scientific and progressive
world view to Indian Muslims.
And of course, it was the
nursery for freedom fighters.
But the sad part is..
..
 can‘t use these
words for AU anymore.
Why?
This place is terribly politicized.
Back in time, differences
were settled through debates.
..these are now settled
through bloodshed.
You think Prof. Siras is
a victim of internal politics?
Oh yes, definitely.
He‘s been intentionally disgraced.
Sugar?
- Yes, one spoon.
Sir, can you tell me
about this in more detail?
About what could have happened...
Look, I want to help Siras..
..and I will do what I can.
But I can‘t rock the boat too much.

t‘s okay.
Thank you.
Hello, sir.
Who?
- Deepu Sebastian...
Dr. Islam must have spoken to you.
Yeah...he did.
lam sorry for the other day, sir.
Whafs wrong?
Something wrong with the meter?
Trying to reconnect
my electricity.
The University had my
Electricity disconnected.
So this is your meter?
No, thafs my neighbofs!
He‘s gone out.
That won‘t do it, sir.
Thafs the earth wire.
Can ltry?
Please stand back.
No...
 mean you might get a shock.
Hmm...this one‘s the earth wire.
What happened?
Just joking, ifs done.
Done!
Shut it.
Take those.
Wanta drink?
No. Thank you.
Sure?
- No...thank you.
Cheers.
Sir, 
‘m not after
your personal details

t‘s none of my business, of course.
But I do know...they had
no right to barge into your home.
This was a conspiracy against me.
By Au?
By some people in AU.
They are jealous of me.
Why?
lam considered an outsider here.
An outsider.
lteach Marathi in
a city that speaks Urdu.

‘m a bachelor amongst married people.
Yet I was appointed the chairman
of the linguistics department.
You know, this morning when
they disconnected my e
ectricity..
..
 wanted to jump to my death
from the University‘s clock tower.
But I stopped.
Thank God I stopped!
Yes, sir.
Now I can drink!
Sir, do you mind ifl record?
Thank you.
You were saying something?
Last January a colleague...
...threatened that he
wou
dn‘t let me remain...
..the chairman of the Linguistic
department for too long.
And a week later this
incident took place.
ls it because you‘re gay?
I don‘t understand this word.
So you‘re not gay?
How can someone describe
my feelings in three letters?

t‘s like poetry..
...that is deep within.
A burning desire"
that cannot be controlled.
An uncontrollable urge.
Which poets have you read?
Poets?
Oh my..
I haven‘t read too many.
Tennyson is too confusing for me.
Too many words make my head spin.
As if poetry is in the words?
Poetry is found in between the words.
In the silencesmthe pauses.
People can interpret
it in different ways.
According to their age,
their maturity...
Understand?
- Understand...yes..
That book of yours,
“Grass Under my Feet“
I looked everywhere for it,
but cou
dn‘t find it.
Naturally,
who buys poetry these days!
And your generation has no
understanding of poetry at all.
They want to put
a label on everything.
Fantastic!
Fabulous!
Super! Superb!
Cool.
- Awesome!
Awesome!
So why did you join AU?
- I love AU.
No, I mean there‘s not
much demand for Marathi here..
I got a lot of respect here.
Now see...there are thousands
of Marathi teachers in Maharashtra.
But in Aligarh, there is only one.
Professor S R Siras!
Only one.
Yeah...on
y one.
Sir...can we talk about that night?
Those people who barged in,
did you know them?
How did they get in?
I don‘t know.
You think they broke in?
Or you did you leave the door open?
Pleasemtalk to me, sir.
You have to help me to help you.
Please sir.
Me and my friend...
...Wé..
..were in this bedroom.
Two people came in.
One was holding a camera...
...and the other was holding a stick.
They pounced on us.
They were hitting us with the stick.
Especially my friend.
They didn‘t let me
wear my clothes either.
They took off my clothes.
I kept pleading...
...not to hit my friend.
Just...
.. just so shameful.
When sudden
y...four of my
colleagues came in my bedroom.
Your colleagues?
What were they doing here?
Its okay, sir.
Am I drunk?
Not yet.
Then 
‘

 have one more.
Sure.
My book.
‘Paya Khali Hirwal.‘
Grass Under my Feet!
If you ever feel like reading poetry.
Thank you, sir.
Oh. But I can‘t read Marathi!

‘ve a translated version as well.
But it is very poorly translated.
I was thinking...l should
translate it myself someday.
So you can give me that cOPY. sir.
No... this is a souvenir.
Okay...thank you.
In that case, can I get an autograph,
No, 
‘

 do it with my pen.
Signed copy.
Love...
...S R Siras.
Okay?
- Yeah...perfect.
Okay, 
‘

 take your leave, sir.
Be careful, ifs quite late.
Pleasure meeting you.

‘

 see you soon.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

‘ve switched on the motor.
This story has got
nothing to do with..
..him being gay or straight.
The question is...how did six peop
e..
..barge into his home
without his permission.
On 2nd July, 2009..
..De
hi High Court
declared section 377...
was unconstitutional.
Prof. Siras‘ suspension
and charge-sheeting..
..is a harsh blow
to the judicial decision.
Today...we need to..
..unite and challenge that decision!
For the first time in Indian History"
..the law is in our favor.
Justice for Siras!
Justice for Siras!
Look, Mr. Siras...
if you decide to challenge AU..
..we will support you entirely.
You don‘t realize it...but
your case is very strong.
Due to the amendment of section 377.
Pardon me,
but 
‘ve no interest in activism.
Mr. Siras, this isn‘t activism.

t‘s fighting for our rights.
Let me show you something, sir.
Take a look at this
signature campaign.
30,000 people have
signed in your support.
You must have heard
about Vijay Grover.
The same lawyer that
argued against section 377.
He wants to represent
you in this case.
I see.
Siras, you‘ve been
working here for so long.
Do you really think they will
revoke your suspension so easily?
You have to fight it out, Mr. Siras.
What will I have to do?
We‘

 have to write in
our petition that you‘re gay.
What?
We‘

 have to write in
our petition that you‘re gay.
Will you be alright?
Do we have your permission?
No. No. No...
No.
Excuse me, professor, please.
Put the luggage down.
What?
- Keep the bag there...please..
.. only for a minute.
Switch it on.
Sir, how does it feel?
What?
How are you feeling
leaving your old home?
Please tell us, sir.
Let me go.
- Please, sir.
Lefs go.
Please, sir.
Take the suitcase up.
The books.
“
t‘s a desire of a restless heart.“
“
t‘s a desire of a restless heart.“
“I will lovemworship you.“
“Make you my God.“
“
t‘s a desire of a restless heart.“
“As long as you didn‘t..“
“..inhibit my forlorn dreams.“
“Happiness was unknown to me..“
“..and sorrows were like a stranger.“
“I even hid my heartbeats from me..“
The problem with 377
was nobody could speak up.
If you said you were gay..
..you were directly
seen as a criminal.
I applaud your courage.
It must not have
been easy coming here.
No, sir. You‘re the courageous one.
You‘re fighting for people like you.
I don‘t think he‘s gay.
He‘s not a gay?
We don‘t say ‘a‘ gay?
What?
- 
t‘s just “He‘s Gay“.
He‘s Gay?
Getting late. Come.
Lefs go.
According to the Times
Asia Higher Education Body..
..A
igarh University is ranked
no.3 amongst Indian Universities.
Clearly such eminent universities.
...have a strict code of conduct.
Mr. Siras didn‘t just
violate these rules"
..in fact, he has also violated
the moral code of his employees.
Due to his obscene behavior
within the University premises..
..he has tarnished the image
of the teacher community.
The victim here isn‘t Mr. Siras..
..the victim here
is Aligarh University"
"because their great reputation
has been tarnished.
By suspending Mr. Siras..
..the Aligarh University
has abided by its rules.
And ifs not illegal to
follow rules and regulations. ls it?
THANK YOU.
Thank you.
Your lordship.
You said AU followed ‘their‘ rules.
‘Their‘ rules. Not the
rules of the Indian Constitution.
You‘re forgetting that..
..in the court we argue
within legislatures and laws.
Article 21 clearly states.
..every citizen of
this country is entit
ed..
..to the right to
privacy and dignity.
Which means,
every citizen of this democracy..
..is equally entitled
to solitude and boundaries.
On the night of 8th February..
..my client was deprived
of his constitutional right.
Some people forcefully
entered his home..
..and filmed him
in his private moments.
When the University officials.
Proctor Zuber Khan,
deputy proctor Feroz Majid..
..PRO Shadab Qureshi and
Media Advisor AK Murtuza arrived..
..they cou
d‘ve stopped
this violation, your lordship.
But instead of reprimanding
those two reporters"
..the University officials
persecuted my client.
They humiliated him.
And the next day, without any
inquiry...AU suspended Dr. Siras.
Without giving him a
chance to even appea
..
..he was charge-sheeted.
He was given only 7
days to vacate his home..
..during which the electric supply
to his home was also disconnected.
Your lordship, my client
is a 64 year old senior citizen.
He had only 3 months
to go before retirement.
Aligarh University"
"has blatantly violated
my clients Constitutional rights.
We appeal to the honorable court..
..that Prof. Siras‘
suspension be revoked.
And his home, 21 Medical Co
ony..
..be immediately
returned to him.
Thank you, your lordship.
Sir, can you hear them now?
Can you hear them
from the studio? - Okay.
Yeah..
- Okay...we‘re ready to go.
Yeah.
Okay. Good luck, sir.
(OIS) Good evening and welcome
to India Fights Back..
a professor of
the Aligarh University"
..on the verge of retirement,
has been fired for being gay.
This new controversy has reignited..
..the homosexuality debate
on the University campus.
And both Students and
Teachers stand divided.
Prof. Siras,
were you sacked because you are gay?
lam very disturbed,
because after years of service..
..the University decided
to take such a step.
lam very much upset.
Those people entered
my house without..
(OIS) Society requires punishment
when there is an offence..
Nobody should be allowed to
devalue our system.
It is not about being gay or anything.
This is about morality.
(OIS) We teacher community,
in any University are..
..to teach moral values.
(OIS) So nobody should be a

owed...to
devalue our own system.
They are not asking me any question.
Islam is against
any sex outside marriage.
And anybody who is
coming in the way of..
..the survival of
humanity as well as..
..the advancement of the humanity.
He

o..
Listen...
- He wants to pee...
He wants to go to the loo.
Can you put him on loop?
Yes, put him on loop please.
Yes, okay..
So tell us Mr. Qureshi.
The proctor and I were having dinner..
..at a guesthouse close-by.
We heard that, someone was filming
something at the Medical Colony.
As the Public Relations Officer,
ifs my duty..
..to be present if there is
any filming on campus.
I called up Deputy Proctor Dr. Majid..
..and Media Advisor Prof. Murtuza,
and asked them to accompany me.
What did you see when you got there?
I saw that...
...Siras and his partner
were sitting on the bed.
Siras was in his undergarments.
..and he was apologizing
to those reporters.
I immediately demanded
to see the videotape.
And what I sawmwas completely
vulgar and shameful.
What did you see?
It was embarrassing.
He was involved in an immoral
act with that rickshaw-puller.
So was it sexual in nature?
Homo-sexual.
Practicing homosexuality
within the University premises..
"is totally immoral
and is forbidden.
He was suspended under the AU rules.
Thank you.
No more questions.
Please.
Mr. Qureshi, what were you and Proctor
doing that night in the guest house?
Like I said, we were having dinner.
Just dinner?
Was it just the two of you?
Where were your wives?
What do you mean?
I mean did they know you
two were alone in the guest house?
What kind of a question is that?
Two peop
e...a

 alone in a empty
guest house. Anything is possible.
I object.
- Sustained.
Mr. Qureshi, how did you find out..
..that some people were filming
at 21 Medical Colony?
It got an... anonymous phone call.
Anonymous phone call? Convenient.
Did they have permission to shoot?
No.
So when you saw them
shooting without permission..
..did you take any action?
Did you call the police?
No.
Why didn‘t you call the police?
When I arrived, I saw that Siras
was apologizing to the reporters.
He was embarrassed.
He admitted his mistake.
- Thafs alright.
Why didn‘t you call the po
ice..
..because they were
shooting without permission?
But Siras could‘ve
called the police as well.
But...he didn‘t.
There was no doubt that he was guilty.
Didn‘t you feel that Prof. Siras
was mortified..
..by the violent and aggressive
behavior of those reporters?
Thafs why I demanded
to see the videotape.
He did not seem ‘mortified‘
while in the act.
Why did you call those
reporters to another room?
What was the need for a private
conversation at that moment?
Because I personally requested
them not to air the tape.
I didn‘t want the University‘s
reputation to be maligned.
Really?
Times!
Herald!
Daily!
Exactly two days 
ater..
..you were giving interviews
to every newspaper.
Didn‘t you think about
the University‘s reputation then?
The prosecution is trying
to mislead the court your honor.
Thafs not true your honor.
- That is true.
The question isn‘t
how my clients got there.
The question is about...
Mr. Siras‘ gross misconduct.
And anyway, why are we
sermonizing about his innocence?
When he has already accepted
that he was wrong.
Thafs not true, your honor.
- That is true.
This is just a..
- Can I just show something to you?
Allow me.
This is a letter
that was written by him.
It is signed by him, and..
..it is addressed to the
vice-chancellor of the University.
lam sorry, your lordship,
we don‘t have a copy of that.

‘

 give you a cOPY. Mr. Grover.
Please.
He‘s clearly accepted in this 
etter..
..that he‘s wrong.
Why did you write that letter?
Sridharan asked me to.
He tried talking to
the Vice Chancellor for pardoning me.
ls he your friend?
- Yes.
You will have to talk to him.
This letter doesn‘t look good.
He will have to depose.
lwill try.
Look, Siras...
...no one from my fami
y..
"has ever been to
a police station or court.
Don‘t humiliate us. Please.
Sridharan, I am feeling bad too.
But they are using
that letter against me.
Who asked you to go to the court?
I told you...this matter
would die down in a few months.
What else could I do, Sridharan?
Now this has become
a public issue, Siras.
Sorry, you will have
to endure it alone.
Dinner‘s ready.
Okay?
Fine.
Fine, fine.
Fine.

Aunty.
Maggfs taking tuitions in my room.
So?
- So? Thafs my room.
Don‘t be so na'
've.
Then do it in your room.
Your room is always empty"
..you often come late.
So I let her give tuitions there.
What do I do now?
I want to change? Where do I go now?
You‘re always such a mess anyway!
Go mind your business!
What..
- Sorry.
Tenants these days think
They own the house.
Deepu..
Deepuy
Wake up!
Wake up!
Were you working late?
Did you not see your email?
- What happened?
Siras‘s video..
with the rickshaw-puller.
What happened?
Lets go to the conference room.
Catch him! Catch him!
What have I done?
Let me go, sir.
I haven‘t done anything.
No, I haven‘t done anything.
Let me go.
Do it! Do it now!
I haven‘t done anything.
Why did you stop?
Look here.
We weren‘t doing anything.
Let me go.
D0 it!
Take that off.
Whafs your name?
- lrfan
Excuse me.
Do you know where lrfan lives?
The rickshaw puller.
Do you know where lrfan lives?
He‘s a skinny boy, pulls a rickshaw.
I don‘t know.

t‘s okay. Thank you.
Do you know where lrfan lives?
lrfan?
Where does lrfan live?
This is 
rfan‘s house.
ls he at home?
- He isn‘t.
Where did he go?
The police gave him a sound thrashing.
And we don‘t know where he is now.
Any address.
Stop bothering me..
- No, no...
 am not bothering you.
Please go away.
Just two minutes.
- Please go away. I said go away.
Go away.
Please...if you have any address.
I said I don‘t want to
talk about lrfan. Go away.
Salim!
Salim!
Yes aunty..
Salim, this boy‘s troubling me.
Why are you bothering her.
- No, no, I am not bothering her.
Deepu.
- Sir.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
I was told that I have a visitor"
..and I was thinking
who this person is.
I was crossing through this town.
I knew you were here.
So I thought I should look you up.
Crossing all the
way through Allahabad?
No, actually I wanted to know
how the court case was going..
..and ifs been a while.
I thought I must come and see you.
Actually I was going to have lunch.
Will you join me?
- Yeah, of course.
As long as you‘re paying for it..
- Sure. why not.
lam kidding sir. Of course.
How did you get that bruise?
This one.
This?
Oh, this.
This was during World War 1,
with the Germans.
very funny.
Some more lentils?
- No.
Just a little.
- No.
Why?
- No.
You touched it.
- So?
You‘re eating meat,
we‘re Brahmins.
Oh my... sorry sir, I didn‘t know.
- 
t‘s okay.
I don‘t understand
all this religious stuff!
Religion isn‘t
something to understand.
The minute you start rationalizing,
you sacrifice faith.
I did see “Aastha“ (faith)
on television! I understand!
How‘s the court case going?
Are you taking my interview, Deepu?
No, no, sir.

‘ve just come to meet you.
So, how‘s the court case coming along?
Very boring.
I go crazy with boredom!
But I blame my father
for this.
Why?
He was a lawyer.
I grew up hearing about sections,
petitions, arguments...
But I didn‘t understand it then..
And I still don‘t understand it!
lcan imagine.
I have a strange relation
with law as well.
When I was a kid,
I would argue with everyone
People would say
“He will become a lawyer.“
I even prepared for Law school.
I managed to get admission too.
But fortunately I changed my mind.
But dad...who paid
100,000 rupees as fees.
..he still taunts me about it.
Dads are all the same really.
ls he happy with your job now?
Either be a doctor, or a engineer...or
go abroad and mint money.
Nothing else matters.
And your family members?
Two brothers, in Nagpur.
Do you talk to them?
We don‘t get along.
We‘ve been living apart for 3O years.
But their children
are very close to me.
Children don‘t judge you.
Never.
Didn‘t your parents pressurize you
for marriage?
I mean it normally
happens in small cities.
The family pressurizes you
for marriage after a certain age.
I did get married.
- You did?
Back when I got a job as a professor.
She did come to Aligarh as well.
But it did not work out.
Because you are gay?
No, it wasn‘t that.
Then?
I was too busy with
my books and my old film songs.
She got bored of me and left.
Now tell me honestly,
how did you get that bruise?
This!
Actually I went to Jamalpur,
to meet lrfan.
That place is really rough.
lrfan doesn‘t live there anymore.
He ran away.
His mother said that
the police thrashed him up.
Why are they harassing the poor man?
You think lrfan was involved too?
Meaning?
Your door wasn‘t damaged
from the outside.
So someone might have
left it open from within.
Maybe I didn‘t shut it properly.
There are three latches on your door.
And you forgot to lock all of them?
Sir, I am sorry but..
..you will have to be
comfortable talking about lrfan.
Otherwise these people
will drive you crazy.
We knew each other for just 8 months.
At my age, people often get lonely.
Was he your lover?
You people are so obsessed
with the word ‘
over‘..
..at least try to
understand ‘
ove‘.
Its a beautiful word..
You‘re making it
sound like a dirty word.
I have a problem with this.
Can I take a picture with you?
With me?
- Yeah.
Look.
Nice.
lam looking so bad.
- No, you‘re looking very good.
You are a very good looking man.
Oh, God!
Thank you.
Alright, sir.
See you next time,
after you win the case.
Thank you for coming.

t‘s an honor, sir. Goodnight.
Deepu.
My book.
Sir, I still know
just one word in Marathi.
‘Marathif
No, no...
 translated this in English.
I had nothing to do in the court.
So I thought 
‘d
translate this for you.
Wow!
Thank you so much, sir.
My English is not as
good as you peop
e‘s English.
Thank you, sir, really.
Welcome.
Goodnight, sir.
“O beloved moon,
fear not the dawn that separates us.“
“For we will meet again,
when the world goes to sleep.“
“In the light of day, I am unseen.“
“It is in your light,
my heart awakens.“
“We will dance as shadows dance..“
“..to the songs of nightingales.“
“We will touch as shadows touch..“
“..becoming one in the midnight sun.“
“O beloved moon,
fear not the dawn that separates us.“
“For we will meet again,
when the world goes to sleep.“
Keep it on tonight.
Why?
I feel cold in the dark.
I feel hot.
I feel scared.
Of whom?
I did not realize that two
people had already entered my flat.
They claimed to be
from News 100 channel.
They pounced on us and one of them...
started beating us with a stick.
Especially...
My friend.
They didn‘t let me
wear my clothes either.
lmasked why they‘re doing it,
they said"
..“We‘ve received a complaint“.
“How dare you behave so
obscenely in a family society?“
And then they made us
stand in a corner..
..and took our pictures
in embarrassing positions.
I kept requesting them to stop"
..and thafs when four
of my University colleagues.
..came into my bedroom.
Can you tell the names of your
colleagues to the honorable court?
Yes.
University Proctor, Dr. Zuber Khan.
Deputy Proctor, Dr. Feroz Majid.
University PRO, Dr. Shadab Qureshi.
Professor AK Murtuza.
I was surprised to see them.
Because I neither called
nor asked anyone for help.
Prof. Siras, you didn‘t call them?
- No, I didn‘t.
They stood there
and kept staring at me.
And they did not let me
wear my clothes...
Then, they took the reporters
to the adjoining room..
..where they had a conversation.
Later the reporters left.
Shadab Qureshi returned to my room..
..and I pleaded with him
that he keep this under wraps.
And he assured me
that he has the tape..
..and he will ensure
it remains private.
But next day...this story was
published in every local newspapen.
..a
ong with my photograph.
And then I was suspended.
Mr. Siras, what was your relationship
with the rickshaw-puller?
I asked, what was your relationship
with the rickshaw-puller?
He was a friend.
Friend.
Will you tell the court
about your exact relation with him?
Your lordship,
this has no connection with the case"
Fine, I will change my question.
You‘re such a senior professor,
Mr. Siras..
..and you mingle with
a lower-class Muslim from the slums?
What kind of a friendship is this?
We would listen to music.
Listen to music? What else?
Watch movies together.
- Watch movies?
And you would pay
him to have sex with you.
Your lordship,
she‘s asking ridiculous questions..
Tell us, Mr. Siras.
- She‘s only talking about the sex!
Fine, okay...
‘

 change my question.
Whafs your age?
63? 64?
64. 64 is your age, right?
Even at 64 you have
the strength to have sex.
Your lordship, such questions
cannot be a

owed.. - Speak up.
Why don‘t you speak up?
Tell us, Siras sir.
lthink you cannotjust.
- 
...
 don‘t want to talk about this.
Why don‘t you want to talk about it?
You‘ve pressed charges against
such an esteemed University.
You will have to
answer my questions.
..but I will change my question.
Tell me...who was the ‘man‘ in bed?
You or the rickshaw-puller?
What is she talking?
- Tell us, Mr. Siras.
Whafs wrong?
You have to vacate
the house right now.
Why?
Bachelors aren‘t allowed here.
Why did your agent lie?
You‘re not married.
You lied.
No, I am married.
I was...
 mean...
 still am.
Fine. Then...
Where is your family?
I have a family.
- Where?
My family is in Nagpur,
and I live here.
You can stay here when
you bring your family.
Take your luggage and get out.
Why?
If the others living
here are ‘familiesﬂ.
..did I bother anyone?
No, you didn‘t.
But you 
ied..
That you‘re a family.
-I lied?
Yes.
Didn‘t you take security fees?
- Yes, I did.
Didn‘t you take a deposit from me?
- Yes, I did.
Didn‘t you take registration?
- Yes, I did.
Why?
- For renting my apartment.
So I am staying in this apartment.
I don‘t care.
We have families living here,
Bachelors are not allowed.
Are bachelors terrorists?
- Maybe.
Vacate the room.
- Why should I?
Rasca
...ba§~~~
Who do you think you are?
What?
Did I pick a fight? Or trouble you?
What do you think you are?
- What are you saying?
Why did you take security fees?
- I did.
Why did you take deposit?
- I did.
Why did you take it?
I took it because
I rented the apartment to you.
This is your apartment?
- Yes.
Then stay in your apartment.
- What is this?
Rascal!
What are you all staring at?
This is a peaceful neighborhood.
There‘s a stainless
steel factory close-by..
..and they make really good locks.
How many locks will I need?
- Sir, I would advise two.
You have to be careful. Right?
Did you talk to the owner?
- Yes.
The owner stays out of town mostly.
Just keep in mind,
too many ‘guests‘ are not allowed.
Stop here.
Just a bit ahead.
Take a look.
Does this look alright?

t‘s a well maintained room.
Here‘s the key.
And... registration charges.
I won‘t vacate this
place before one year.
Only then will I pay.
Even the owner won‘t ask
you to leave before a year.
Swear on your kids?
- Yes, I swear.
Bring the luggage in.
Every society, every institution"
"has the right to
filter ifs members.
Will you allow immoral
characters in your premises.
..where you are raising your children?
No!
Mr. Siras lied about being married
and duped his neighbors.
And when his neighbors found out..
..that random men visit him
at untimely hours, they complained.
Why should such immoral
acts impact our children?
Was Prof. Siras carrying
his business out in the playground?
Why were these people
peeking in his house?
What business do neighbors
have looking into someone‘s bedroom?
And who‘s morality are
we talking about, your lordship?
Because the definition of
morality is open to interpretation.
Those who are vegan,
might consider meat-eaters immoral.
Married people might
consider divorcees as immoral.
What is the boundary of morality?
If someone strays out
of one‘s moral boundaries.
"should he be punished?
Because if that‘s the case,
then every citizen of this country..
..should be in prison for violating
someone else‘s moral boundaries.
We‘re not talking about any
one person‘s morality, Mr. Grover.
We‘re talking about
the collective morality..
..of the 175 year
old Aligarh University.

...
...
 understand.
-Yes.
Collective morality.
I would like to tell
my learned friend..
..that no institution has the right
to invade someone‘s personal life.
I would like the honorable
judge to refer to..
..De
hi High Courfs
historic July 2009 judgment..
..in the NAZ foundation
Vs Government of NCT De
hi..
..where Delhi High court
decriminalized homosexuality.
Even in that case, the opposition‘s
main line of defense was morality.
We argued...that there has to be
a constitutional boundary to morality.
It must have
constitutional limitations.
Because if we leave it ambiguous.
..peop
e can misuse it
to further their vested interests.
It took us 1O years,
but we won the battle.
While de-criminalizing homosexuality"
..the division bench stated.
If there is one constitutional tenet..
..which can be said
to be the underlying theme..
..of the Indian Constitution,
it is that of inclusiveness.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Grover.
But the section 377 amendment
that you‘re talking about..
"is applicable only in the
Delhi High court.
And this is the Allahabad High court.
And here homosexuality
is still illegal.
It is a crime.
lam very sorry that my
learned friend doesn‘t rea
ize..
..that the Indian constitution
is equal for everyone.
Whether its Delhi or A

ahabad..
..any High court order applies
to all the states of India.
Until...it isn‘t challenged in
a particular state, and overruled.
Therefore the Delhi High court order..
..decrimina
izing homosexuality...is
binding on this court too.
Thank you, your lordship.
Namaste!
Prof. Siras, meet Mehmood Naqvi.
Very well known artist from Delhi.
Thafs Abhilash Tripathi.
Mr. Tripathi is a renowned poet.
And thafs Prathamesh Sharma.
He‘s a lawyer.
You and me are mere illusions.

Fear not the dawn that separates us.
For we must meet again,
when the world sleeps.
