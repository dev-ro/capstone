They told us to wait for 10 minutes
That's why i'm waiting here
Stuff it all in
Hurry up
(banging on shutter)
(uproar)
Go and check
I'll kill him
Thanks, sir
You didn't tell us
who you are, sir
Jagdish
Vigilance officer
What guts to sell liquor
illegally on 'Gandhi jayanthi'?
Stuff all the cash in
Show all that you sold
illegally at the Head office
Then collect your stuff
Please sir...sir
Do what I say
Shall we complain
in the police station?
We don't stand a chance
We sold all this illegally
How do they act with
 all these contraptions?!
Hey Jet!
We thrashed them, huh?
You thrashed me!
Didn't you tell me
you'd hit me lightly?
And you hit me
with a bottle!
So sorry, dude
I wanted the opening scene
to have a great build up-
I went overboard
Doesn't matter
I'll buy you a drink
You'll be fine
Don't trouble yourself
I flicked this
from the wine shop!
You crafty fox!
For the next 2 months
Don't show your heads in this area
Off you go
Mass, we put in so much effort
and planned brilliantly
We got only about 300000 bucks
They walked away
with half the loot
I'm in tension
Don't worry
I've already planned
our next heist in millions
Really?
What's my disguise?
I won't need a mask, right?
A task beyond any mask!
Stop...stop!
- Prince 'anna'
- What, da?
A navy boat is
heading towards us
Stop your boat
We need to check
Go to that damn boat
They'll flee for their lives
if they hear the name 'Reddy'
- Stop...!
- Mind your business
Hey! What have you got
smuggled in your boat?
Open all the cartons
You know we are Reddy's men
We've given bribes
at the right places
Clear off
How dare you talk to a senior officer
 with such scant respect?
Sir, what shall we do to him?
Reddy 'anna' will get back at you
Who cares
Bloody Reddy!
Know how many boats we'd have
checked from Katpadi to Kashmir?
Search the boat completely-
(random names of Hindi films)
Search properly
Look inside the cabin
Look here, sir
Bag full of money
What?
Mr Manicka Vinayagam?
Sorry!
Vinayak Mahadevan
Check that sack
I can see something moving
Sir, officer Arnold
Oh God!
Officer?
Please save me
These terrorists tied me up
in a sack and brought me here
Before I die I must do
 something good for our country
"Mother, I salute thee"
They are trying to escape, sir
Dive into the sea
Cash...clean sweep!
How could you think
he's a navy officer?
No, bro
Which area did you see him in?

Go there and dance
We saw a guy in
the church that night?
You kept talking about him
He is just behind us
- Move
- I can't
- Yov! I said, move
- I won't, man
Spoiling for a fight!
Head nurse will yell her head off
Oh! Nurse, huh?
My throat seems
a little sore from morning
Do you know why-
Nothing to worry
Must be yesterday's liquor
You'll be fine
soon enough
Did I talk to you, smarty?
How does one go
to your hospital?
Land up with a disease!
Thanks
Waiting for my nose
to be snubbed, huh?
Where is he?
Where did they go?
I have an awesome DVD of
the Suriya starrer 'Singam'
Hello?
How are you?
I know for sure
he is following you
Let's just ignore him
and continue walking
I know what to do
Just zip your lips
Hello! How are you?
How's your job getting along?
Are you working
in this school?
Of course not
IT corridor nearby
You have a royal
sense of humor!
- Too good
- Thanks
We are late
Let's go
Hey! Kungfu Panda
How is your David?
He got caught in
the DVD piracy case
Police came over to
his house to question him
Hey! What happened?
Sis, give me a minute
I'll be right back
Where are you goin-
Come, my dearest
Isn't your brother David?
Yes, bro
This DVD piracy party
Vishal nabbed him
He's the one, right?
Don't raise your voice please
Isn't he still in jail?
If they know at the hospital
it will be such a shame, bro
Just like a grapefruit
tart and tangy
You and your sarcastic digs!
- What's your plan tomorrow?
- Nothing
We'll go wherever
you want us to go, bro
Okay
I'll tell you over the phone
tomorrow about your program
Okay, bro
See you
Is Kumar there?
Why did you want to
come here all of a sudden?
Hostel is boring
Hiiiiiii!!
What a surprise!
You've also come to Theme park
No, there's a temple
for Goddess Shakthi
I thought I should
come here and pray
Weekdays are filled with work
Sunday is one day
for us to do as we please
Be jolly and live it up
What, da?
Hello?
Do you like this song?
How can you even ask me that!
I'm a big fan of S.A.Rajkumar!
Nowadays music directors
don't come like him!
Even I like his music a lot
When I tell this to my firends
they make fun of me
Shows they have
no music sense!
Have you heard this song from
 a film with Sharath Kumar as hero?
"Princess, not seeing you, my heart-"
Hello...that's composed
by maestro Ilaiyaraja
He has composed
a similar tune
I know
i've heard it
"Delicate rose, so petite"
That's it
I just can't sleep
without listening to his songs
You know when I hear
his songs, I feel...
...I'm lying on my mother's lap
In the best comfort zone ever
I don't feel that way
Why?
My mother passed away
When I was very young
I'm sorry
But you know-
When I listen to his songs...
...I feel like I am
asleep in his own lap!
Really...I swear
That's how I feel
Why did you laugh?
Lying on S.A.Rajkumar's lap and-
Come on, I've spoken
to a few people I know
It's no big deal at all
It's not going to
be a problem
Come on
Cheer up, sis
Hi Malini
I am...
Masss
I just have to say this
You...
...are very beautiful
No one here...
...would have seen such a beautiful-
Beauty that's a joy forever
And I'm in love with you
Masss, you've already
said this in 2008!
Try somethng new
You think so?
Then let me go
straight to the spot
I'll talk impromptu and
 hook her with my charm
Go for it, Masss
Hi...hello
You look kind of troubled
Nothing of that sort
You seem to be
in low spirits today
What happened yesterday, bro-
Keep quiet
What happened?
Did anyone tease you?
Did someone in the bus try-
In your area, or at home
Tell me, I can
set it right for you
Nothing of that sort happened
No problem
Then why dull?
1 minute
I'll be back
Rear side of
 Stanley hospital, bro
Come here
What's the hassle?
Did they stitch him up
with a watch inside during surgery?
How silly!
Move and stand aside
Wait for me
Don't ruin what
little chance I've got
Continue, my dear
Sis has been trying for
the head nurse post here
2 days ago when she attended
the interview, the Dean said...
'...there is a long queue
 eyeing this post'
I'm offering it to you because...
...you're a hard worker
To get this post
3500000
You get promoted
the very next day
I can't afford to pay
such a huge sum-
This is a special concession for you
If you pay this amount...
...your job will be permanent
Okay, Malini?
We are breaking
our heads over it, bro
Whomever we asked
is unwilling to help us
Julie!
She's so tensed-
Keep quiet
Don't take whatever
she told you seriously
What are friends there for?
3500000
I'll arrange it for you
Child's play to me
Give me 2 hours
I'll give the cash
 at your doorstep
We'll confirm the job you like
No, it's okay
Please listen to me
I'll manage
When in love
all this is common
Aren't you...
...in love with me?
We are like bees and honey
When we've wrapped ourselves in
this bond, how can we act like strangers?
Instead...
...unwrap this gift
packed with my love
Wow!
Take it
Our bus is here, sis
Shucks!
Forget it, let's drink and
bury our heads in sadness
Thanks
Oh God!
Jet...!
Let's head for the bar
Drink and be merry
Masss...Lady luck is smiling!
Jet, I'm thrilled to bits
My life is settled for good
I'll live life king size
- Hello, navy officer
- Let go of me
I'll take you to Arnold
Who the hell are you?
Reddy...?
I swear I didn't know
 it was your money
Would I have taken it
if I had known?
Masss is such a weird name!
My name is Masilamani
Boys in my area call me
Masss as a pet name
I maintained the same
because it sounds cool
One tight slap!
If you're Mr Mass
 is he Master Mass?
No...no, sir
Prince...?
Yes, bro
Kill one right here
Kill the other when you get
 the money in your hands
Only then this area
will be terrified of me
I'll take care of it
How did you get
conned by this fellow?
Madcap!
Don't
Let go of him
If you come near me,
I'll drop him down
Listen to me
Go back
Now do you realize
why they call me Masss?
Leave him
Hear me out, Masss
Know the risk you’re taking
You won't go back alive
Step back
I'll hit you
Will you try to escape?
Let go of me
Masss...don't
Guys, nab him
Oh gawd!
They are here
This way
God help me!
That way
Where are you going, Mass?
They are coming on their bikes
That side
Masss!
Whose bike is this?
Quick...quick
Go...go
Drop him
That side
Bend down
Careful...knife!
Masss, please don't turn
No need, Masss
Let's just escape
Watch me now
He hit him
Speed up
He's following us
Who's that shooting at us?
Go up
Masss, careful...don't risk it
God save me!
Watch out...door!
Take that bag
Check if everything is okay
Is it correct?
Okay, let's leave
That way
Who's shooting ow?
Hey! Don't shoot
They are right behind us
Don't miss the bag
He's aiming at us, Masss
Watch out
He's behind us
Jump...oh gawd!
He's shooting again
Don't shoot
Don't shoot I say
Start the car
Thank God, we escaped
Why?
Watch out
Why are you driving like a maniac?
Be quiet for sometime
Fasten your seat belt first
That's okay
Wear it
Many years ago, 2 friends
of mine went to Goa
...to hook only white girls
They would've made them
fall hook, line and sinker
Goa is fine, as far as places go
But will that aunty agree?
Good lord!
Are you going for
 your honeymoon?
Our plans got messed up
only because of her
Fights and chase wouldn't
have been necessary
We could've happily gone to Goa-
On the spot dead, dude
Must be drunken driving, sir
Hey! Go take a look
They start the morning
 with a peg or two!
Police...police
Shucks, he's dead
If we stay here longer
it will become dicey, let's scoot
- Hey! Jet
- Masss...?
Cash!
What happened to the money?
Cops took it all away
 the other day itself
Forget the money
How are you feeling now?
Cops took it?
'The other day' means...?
How many days have I
been in the hospital?
Must be about 7 or 8 days
7 or 8 days?
Rs 6400000 I say!
We could have settled
in life for good
Hospital bill will create
a huge hole in our wallet!
Oh my God!
What's he doing here?
Masss...Masss...Masss
Bro, Prince
Why is Reddy here?
Did he find out we are here?
I've come to the hospital for chest pain
Wow!
Love, huh?
Reddy also is here
She's responsible for our accident
Plus we lost all that money
So you had better not dilly dally
When love is in the air
these villains love making an entry!
Today of all days
 unfortunately nobody is caught!
Where did he come from?
Sir, what's the time?
What?
Time
I wanted to know what the time is
Why are you staring at me
like you've seen a ghost?
His watch is just to show off
Come along, Masss
Driving an auto
and what audacity!
You watch your step, man
Okay, dude!
Excuse me, wait
- 2 strong tea, please
- ‘Oldie drools over heroine’s hip’
Sir, move aside
Is it glam-doll Namitha's photo?
He is...?
Hey Chinna
Look, he's washing
his face at the tea shop
Azhagu
He's wearing a blue shirt
This guy?
Yeah, same guy
Let's circle him
and close his chapter
I think Reddy's men
are here to kill us
Where?
I had asked for 2 tea, right?
I'll count 1-2-3
And we'll escape
One
Two
Three!
Masss, quick
Get into the bus
Good for nothing idiot!
I should be
the one to say '3'!
- Get in
- Grab him
Hey! Trying to bump me off?
Try your luck
Hurry up
First shut the door
How do we stay in
 this house hereafter?
- We must escape at the crack of dawn
- Keep saying 1,2,s,x,y and z!
Reddy's men will surely kill us!
Hey! Jet
Didn't you see someone walk past?
Your fertile imagination
I'm feeling sleepy!
Hey! Jet
Will you please shut that window?
(snoring)
Hey...!
Pccht!
Jet...Jet
What happened?
Reddy's boys are here
Aiyo! What do we do now?
We don't even have the money with us!
Shall we escape
through the back door?
Why should we run?
Who are you?
What do you want now?
Did Reddy send you here?
Did he ask you to
grab the cash and kill us?
We don't have any money
The police took it all away
Commissioner's house is nearby
Shall I call now? Tell me
We are done for!
Hey! I'm telling you
And you keep moving in closer?
No more words
Only action!
Hey Massssss!
There's someone so scary insi-
Something even more scary behind you
Run for your life
Ghost...ghost...help!
How come we are seeing ghosts?
They've been chasing us from the hospital
My leg is hurting
Right behind you
Run...run
Don't come near me
Hey! How do we escape
 from these creatures?
There's only one way
Let's go to a temple
And exorcise them
Don't be funny
I'm not joking
I'm serious
From yesteryear films
by VittalAcharya...
...to films by Sundar.C today
...only God can destroy ghosts!
- You think so?
- Yeah
Run...let's run to safety
Masss...Masss...Masss
Didn't I tell you
spirits won't enter a temple?
Correct, but how do we get out?
The dead is chasing
The living is running
You died and survived, right?
There's more to come
Much more in store for you
Swami, are you talking about us?
I'm so puzzled
From last night
wherever we go, ghosts-
It's all fate's antics
Your destiny!
Isn't this a kind of rebirth for you?
That's why you're able to
see all these ghosts and ghouls
All this is a boon, my boy
- For whom?
- Blessing in disguise
No, I don't want this blessing
Being able to see ghosts
you call it a blessing?
Release them
I don't have that power
Whoever sent them
has to remove them
They are not spirits
They are lost souls
They won't harm you one bit
Just satisfy their wish-list
Then they'll go their own way
Their wish-list?
If I turn my back
they''ll close my chapter
I'm not game for this
You've zoomed through huge catastrophes
Are you scared of these zombies?
If you think a stone is a stone...
...you'll only see a stone!
If you keep the same stone
 in a temple...
...it's God!
Mind is responsible for eveything
If you look at them with fear...
...they'll be ghosts to you
Look at them ordinarily
They'll look like human beings!
Focus your mind
Everything will be fine
Don't be afraid
Gawd! He's looking at me
Is he your friend?
Yes
He's a good boy
Take care
You still have a lot
to care and share
You'll be fine
Not to worry, you'll do fine
Mass, what's he saying?
Don't take him seriously
He just blabbered some nonsense
'Focus your mind'
Only human beings all over the place
Whom will I ask and what to ask?
Sir...?
Excuse me, flower seller
Did you see anyone in a red t-shirt?
No one seems to notice us!
Found 1 fellow
And he also escaped!
They said he went this side
But he's nowhere to be seen!
- Jet
- What?
It's all in the mind, right?
Sir, my phone and wallet are missing
Don't get tensed
This phone costs Rs 35000
Gifted by my future-bride, sir
You might have left it in your car
Let's go and check
You're not responding at all
Please find it for me
They all look only like human beings!
I'm also confused, Jet
You sinner...whose phone is this?
The one who went
past us whining now
His wallet also?
Does this hotel
belong to your dad?
Who will pay the bill?
How to differentiate
humans from ghosts?
I saw an English film, Jet
I believe ghosts can't be
captured in a camera?
Shall we test it?
Let's try
Masss, behind you
Green shirt
He looks spooky
Just like a ghost
Click a snap of him
Hey! Correct
One in a green shirt is a man
The white one is a spirit!
Couldn't get him in the camera
Spirit looks more decent than the man!
No one will believe us if we say it, right?
They will brand us as lunatics
Hey! Stay like that
Yeah, okay
A lady over there
is looking at us
Don't move
Ready?
Just a minute
Smiiiile...!
Got a good shot?
Masss
Masss, am I dead?
Please tell me, Masss
Why did you leave me?
I am having a tough time here
You're ignoring me
and drinking coolly
Hey! I'm so puzzled, dude
I feel so blank
Get me a half boiled egg
You really live life to the fullest
You needn't drink or smoke
You don't even have to bathe
What a cushy life!
You're hassle-free and happy
Why is he talking to himself?
Is this how you talk
to your dead friend?
Are you made of stone or what?
You don't look dead to me at all
Suppose you are not next to me...
...then I might miss you
You are sitting right in front of me
Why should I feel bad?
Still...
...I'm unable to drink
Masss, you know the rites
they do for dead people?
Similarly you can offer
starters and liquor to me
Eat
Go ahead
Help yourself
In your dreams!
You can't even drink
what's right before your eyes
And your taste buds
ask for offerings!
But on top of it
highlight is...
...you being a ghost,
sprinted from all other spirits!
They were all spooky and scary
None of them are fair
and handsome like me, right?
Hey! Come here
Get me the same liquor
that chap is drinking!
Quick...go
(shooing)
Dogs at night
are a real pain
Masss, look over there
2 spirits on top of
the boot of that car
That dog is chasing the spirits away
Are we visible to dogs?
Is that why dogs
start chasing at night?
All these days we thought
they were chasing us?!
They were actually
targetting ghosts only
Imagine if people get to
know this information!
The whole city at night
will be still as a tombstone
Those who watch
night shows are doomed
Will be scared to death
Life is strange
Isn't that Malini?
What's up?
At this time of night?
Fancy seeing you here?
We were waiting for you
in front of your house
Thinking you'll be late
we decided to leave
Very pretty
Sorry, I'm slightly drun-
That's alright
Your friend's death must be a huge loss
I understand
What happened?
Why?
I had just one soul friend
Masss
He has also left me now
Please don't cry
Why are you crying now?
My heart feels so heavy with grief
I'm right here with you
Aiyaiyo!
He has hugged her
A little while ago you told me
you have no feelings whatsoever
Don't cry
We are all there for you
I'll be there for you
Sorry
What did you just say?
I said I'm here for you
Scout's honor?
Maybe...
...for the 2 of us to unite
...Jet went up
Why are you looking up?
I'm here
If Jet was in front of us...
...how happy he'd have been you know
- Look at me
- Jet, go
Do I look happy?
Jet, just go
See you
I'll see you in the hospital tomorrow
No, bro, she isn't coming
nowadays to the hospital
Why?
What happened?
We told you already, right?
Dean wanted a bribe
for her placement
You promised to give-
But you were in
that awful accident-
She came here for the money
Don't think it's love
Mosquito!
How much did you want?
350000
3.5 lakhs
It's doable
Give me just 2 days
No, it's okay
Don't strain yourself too much
I can do it
Oh! Yes, we can!
It's a piece of cake
Take care
See you
Money was her hidden agenda!
Money makes the world go round!!
Get lost
What's your plan of action?
350000
2 days...how?
Ask for a loan?
Or sell your bike?
That bike will hardly fetch
a packet of dates for your date!
What shall we do?
3.5 lakhs in 2 days
I think it's impossible
What's up?
Why that smiley emoticon?
Got an idea, huh?
Azhagu...?
Oh...ohmmmm!
What are you doing there?
Meditation, you moron!
"If you meditate chanting 'Om'
all comforts will land up at your home"
Let's attend a community prayer
(smacking lips)
Yov! What are you doing?
Ages since I ate such a feast
Don't try to be funny
Come with me
What?
Why did you call all of us?
Who else is there?
That's all, Masss
This is it, huh?
For now, yes
Hey...hey, get up
Stand with hands folded in respect
- He's going overboard
- Fold your hands
Why all this build-up?
Build-up begets bowed heads!
Look here! I know why
you are all following me
You have a list of
unfulfilled desires
You think you can tick
 your wish list through me
Am I right?
Each of your wishes can be satisfied
But what do I get in return?
You'll be blessed
Who wants your blessing?
Old man!
Do you need this?
Old man, what do I do
with your blessing?
You don't need food, clothing
shelter, no creature comforts
But I do, right?
I get hungry
I need to look tip top
Pay my rent
Cope with the villains
in each area my work takes me
Plus a new love story
You know what a costly affair
being in love is!
Yes, of course
So first you help me
I will return the favor
according to your wish list
Fair deal
Tailor made for us
Sales rep!
Whose side are you on?
If we asked them for help...
...they are asking help in return
I strongly protest this-
Gone
You're joining with him
 and taking a dig at us!
Chinna, he has promised
 to help us, right?
Sunna! How is he helping us?
Yes, according to Human rights law 407
(wailing)
Madam, I'm talking on your behalf too
And you keep weeping
Keep quiet
That's exactly what I said too
You said, head, dead
Instead of selling, have you
started playing second fiddle?
Why are you both squabbling like this?
(overlap of loud voices)
Shut up!
I kept quiet
giving you a long rope
You are letting your tongue run!
You can't do any damn thing
Yeah, he's right
If you listen to me and help me...
...I'll help you in return
Or else...
...clear out
Jet, ask them to leave
Those who believe
Masss will help you...
...come over to this side
Hey Sales!
Inviting himself
Shameless fellow
- Sir, your name?
- Sripathy
Come this side
like Sripathy
Come on, guys
They've gone out of
their way to request you
Come over
Uncle, just come
Don't go over there
Loser!
Don't we all need to be helped?
That's what we were
waiting for all along
Why are you hesitating?
Goddess Shakthi has sent
this boy specially for us
Come over
Listen, old man
We'll agree because of you
But mind you, they shouldn't
go back on their words
Hello!
Such words don't exist
in my dictionary
Sonny, what should we do?
If we just cut this scene-
(humming)
Can I eat now?
Give me few minutes
Won't I be hungry?
How long will I wait here?
I came out of the shower hours ago!
What happened, dear?
Hunger pangs increased!
Don't show now
You're in for a lecture
Soooper  report card
3 zeroes
Very good
I love you, my dear son
Remove your glasses
2 zeroes are here
Where did they find the 3rd zero?
Useless fellow!
I don't know why you go-
Why is your plate jumping like that?
Run...run
Wait, don't leave me
Get inside
Let me also come in with you
Hello...who is it?
Someone has opened the hot water tap
9-6-000
690-9
I don't know whose number this is!
You better call right now
Can I meet the owner of this house?
I'm the owner, sir
Why are you looking so pathetic?
Sir
The TV moves in my house, sir
Books fly off the shelf
Plates act like frisbees
Am I not here for you?
Don't worry
Thank you, sir
Come inside
Did the TV move?
Yes, sir
Boss, my handiwork
Just 1 push
- Did plates jump?
- Yes, sir
Sat at the table and
it started dancing, sir
I take full responsibility
Actually you know how I got this idea-
Just shut up and keep quiet
I was the one
who threw toys at him
Only then he pressed the panic button
Due to my age I couldn't
throw ay stuff at him
Already my heart is beating fas-
You are already dead
What's your problem?
Shouldn't you respect him for his age?
How can you yell at him?
We've done our part
It's your turn now
(gibberish mantra)
There are many spirits in your house
Many spirits...?
Soooper
He means all of us
Because you have made
some blunders in your life
True, sir
Is there any retribution, sir?
Rs 500000
5 lakhs?
It is too much, sir
This won't work
Will you keep quiet, dear?
I'll pay you whatever you ask
Oh! The main switch is here
Just tell us what we should do
What you need to do is-
In your prayer room,
draw a star with rice flour
Box it with drumsticks
Place a rolling pin in the centre
With the power of my prayers...
...if the rolling pin
crosses over the drumstick
...means your house
is free of spirits
Azhagu, super channel
Doesn't she dance
with wings to her feet?
Masss, who is she?
Katrina Kaif
Masss, how much longer?
Shall I roll it out?
Okay...okay
Hold on to it
Enough, he asked you to wind up
Shall I bring it out?
Roll...roll...roll over
Wait
Let me do the honors
You'll be ghosts-free hereafter
Sign your son's report card
Okay, my boy?
'You know, there is
a spooky world out there'
'This is very very scary'
"Boo-boo-boogeyman the monster"
"A good catch made him the winner"
"Boo-boo-boogeyman a specter"
"The right catch made him the winner"
"He has the gift of the gab, you bet"
"He worked 24x7 to be the best"
"He’ll be right next to you; still
cross the 8 seas he will"
"To bring items fanciful"
"He’s a wily whiz-kid"
"He’ll simply say ‘take your pick’
Plant gifts on your palm double quick"
"Not just once but quite often
he paints the town a deep maroon!"
"By pulling a fast one, rascal clever

With knack he hooked a good looker"
Didn't Masss bro tell us
he works in a finance company?
All lies
You know what he is up to?
You called me and now you're silent
Do you believe in ghosts?
You might as well have been quiet!
Why do you flick a good
love scene and choose horror?
Answer my question
Do ghosts exist or not?
Will anyone say it exists if it doesn't?
Have you seen a ghost?
Ghosts...I haven't seen any
How do you exorcise them
 if you haven't seen any?
You left this behind at
Julie's uncle's house last week
What's your link
with these spirits?
You won't believe me
I've been seeing ghosts
 for sometime now
Didn't I say you won't believe me?
Just leave it
They are rich enough
to part with their money
Don't justify what you earn
through unfair ways
The doctor who demanded a bribe
for your job is justified!
You paying up is excused
Only problem is how
I earned that money!
Is that right?
Hello...?
Sir, I'm calling from Besant Nagar
Something strange is happening in our house
I'm outside now
I'll talk to you later
Sir, please, hello-
If I should get a job
by exploiting people...
...then I don't want that job
If you want
I'll return that money
I should repay Julie's uncle
If I do that, problem solved?
Why get tensed for this?
It isn't hunky dory
just because you pay back
Please give up
being a con man
You've had a raw deal in life
from when you were a kid
I do understand
But now I'm with you, right?
Let's start life afresh
Listen to me
Sir, I had called you earlier
I'm outsid-
I'm willing to pay any amount
- Where are you?
- Besant Nagar
- Address?
- 17, Ashtalakshmi Nagar
Okay, I'll come
Trust me, I'll come
Here's the ring you gave me
Sir, please come
Bye
Please rush here at once
Will be there in 10 minutes
Okay, sir
Hello...you are-
Are you the one who called me?
Okay, let's go inside
We don't want to come in
Give me that money
Rs 300000
Even if you want more
we are prepared to pay
We'll stay outside
Let's go
Why have you turned
this place upside down?
Hey...Jet
Didn't I tell you all to take off?
Why this torture?
Hey! Can't you hear me?
I'm talking to you
Hey! Who is that?
Come out
Don't simply try to scare me
Whoever it is should own up
Do you get it?
Who did this?
Jet...!
Okay, fine...Sripathy?
Guys, where are you?
Why this cat and mouse game?
Who are you?
Masss, I was looking for you everywhere
Who is this?
Looks like your clone
Who are you, man?
I am-
I know
You are both twin brothers
In the estate in Ooty...
...your manager and 2 of his friends
pushed you down the hill and killed you
Actor Major Sundarajan
played a  major part
Will you shut up?
Who are you?
You're wrong if you think
I'm your sibling
My name is Sakthi
I need a favor from you
Oh! You are a Tamilian from Ceylon, huh?
Thank God
If you had introduced yourself
as my sibling...
...our story would have
taken a different turn
To ask for my help
you gave such a build up!
What build up, Masss?
Lights are turning off
Foot ball rolls around the floor
He even entered from that mirror
Oh! Really?
- Even I got a little jittery
- Seriously...?
Why did you play such a drama?
There's a mile long queue
of people asking for help
You first stand in line
Hey, if he needs help...
...first teach him
the rules and regulations
Okay
Smart Alec!
Wait, where are you going now?
Why act like a celebrity
when you need help?
Whatever the scene
only Masss can act big
No one else should
Meet me tomorrow morning
I’ll take care of everything
If you’re bored to come by yourself...
...bring a beautiful
glam-doll ghost with you
Marriott top floor, suite room
Upstairs...upstairs
Bye...bye
See you tomorrow
Who went to Julie’s uncle’s house
and gave them the flyer?
I don't know
Julie promptly went and
complained to Malini
I was so hassled
Easier to have a live-in
relationship with ghosts
But girls, I swear!
Death's client!
You could have killed me
What's wrong with you?
Are you really mad?
Or acting like one?
How dare you!
If I get angry-
If you do?
What do you take me for?
Masss
You can’t do any damn-
God has blessed you
with such a super gift
To see supernatural spirits like us
Is this how you abuse it?
Instead you can...
...beg for a living!
Me...a beggar?
If you had been alive...
...I'd have hacked you to pieces
Didn't I tell you to stand in line?
Following me like this
Why this do or die rush?
You are a pro in stealing,
pick pocketing and swindling
Why do you then resort to
sending spirits to different houses...
...terrorize folks
grab their money?
Instead use the same spirits...
...to find out the locker numbers
And right there make a killing!
That...how is that possible?
Use spirits to check out lockers
Why didn’t you guys
get such brainwaves?
That’s not the point…
Your I.Q level when alive...
...will be the same after you die too!
Only in films ghosts will be brainy
What rubbish!
How much is the locker worth
in the house we went to now?
I have no idea about that locker
But the locker I’m talking about...
...has 750 million
Oh my gawd!
750 million?
That's a big bluff
- Where?
- Sembikarai
- Aiyaiyo...!
- Why?
Sir, that’s too far
Don’t you have anything nearby?
- Hey...!
- What?
Ouch!
In Sembikarai, illegal money transfer
is the most 'happening' business
To convert black money to white...
...this 'hawala' is an easy route
Police, politicians, Government...
...are all well aware
of these transactions
But all of them will turn a blind eye
Because they may also have to come here
to convert their black money into white!
He’s Antony
'Hawala' king of this town
Without his knowledge
not even 1 rupee through 'hawala'...
...can exit or enter this town
His commission alone will run
into millions through this business
This is his food storage factory
Money that comes
for his 'hawala' business...
...will be hidden here
The money we intend stealing...
...is also hidden here
Sir, where is the money?
Where are you taking me?
When is RK’s flight leaving?
Sir, 11.30 flight
- Which flight?
- Lufthansa
Should I go in?
My God!
Sir, bundles of cash
I’ve ever seen this much
piled up in my life, sir
How sad I can’t even touch it
Wish you had shown me
when I was alive, sir
After 'Mangatha' only now
 I’m seeing so much money
Sir, you're God!
Masss, cash stacked up
Worth millions
Did you really see it?
I swear only today
I feel bad I'm dead
Unbelievable amount of money
But saddest thing is
I couldn't touch it
Let's loot all of it
 and settle abroad!
All that money isn’t yours
Aiyaiyo!
50% for me and 50% for you
That’ll do, sir
As soon as you get
 the money in your hands...
...you must tick only my wish list first
Sir, we’ve got our hands dirty so often
Won't we do even this?
What do you say, dude?
Dot!
If you tell us how to loot this cache...
...we can gate-crash
Watch your step
Security will be less after 8:00 p.m
That's the right time
 for us to start our action
Wait! Someone is coming
I can hear someone
Who can see you?
Check and tell me
Sorry, 'Memento' memory!
Step that side
Be careful
Wait...wait
Go...keep going
- Masss, stay here
- Why?
Jet, stay with him
Come back fast
Masss, why did you agree
 to a 50-50 deal with him?
Who the hell agreed?
Let's first grab the loot
We'll help ourselves to 101%
Why do spirits need 50%?
Someone is coming…go hide
Radha, when I’m there...
...don’t worry about anything
You enjoy the trip
Bye bye
Only if you’re alive
Hey! Something is pulling me
It's dragging me
What’s this?
Simply soooper
Hey Vasu, tata!
One more...one more
Super man
I'll wait in the factory here
Okay, I myself will come there
Will be there in 20 minutes
Mass...?
Hey! Where did you go?
I told you to wait there
I was searching for you
Let’s go to the locker
Go that side…right there
- It's over flowing with money
- I'll hit you
Jet, is this the one?
Punch 7693
Didn’t we see 7683 the other day?
Listen to me…press 7693
Which one of you is right?
I’m telling you, press 7693
We've sounded the alarm
He messed up
That’s it!
Stop...stop...stop
What’s happening there?
Hey! What happened?
What number did you say?
The other day I saw him press 7683
Bingo!
Check inside
Treasure trove
Jet, it's a mass of million new notes
What a haul!
750 million
Stuff it all in
Bombay, Delhi, Goa...????
Masss, stop
Let's leave from here
Why did you give us the wrong number?
In all the hurry-burry
I got confused
Men are heading here
Leave the money
Let’s escape now
I’ll finish with this...I’m done
Mass, security is here
Jet, come to the back door
Oh! You can’t do it
Awww! Money
We can take it later
I can hear the guards
Come this side, Mass
Hey! Stop
Run...run
I lost all that money because of you
Messed it up big time
That's our money
We'll come back for it
Now your life is important!
You scumbag!
Mass, let’s first get out of here
All our efforts down the drain
Come
You bloody hoodlum!
I lost it all
Hey! Who are you?
Stop
- Mass...
- What?
Take this car
I’ll deal with you later
Jet, he almost made me a corpse
- Start the car
- I'll torture him
Ask him to get down
Turn off the headlight and drive
How can I drive
without headlights?
I’ll take care of that
Yeah! The expert!!
Where’s he going?
Masss, he's on top of the car
Can’t see a thing
How to get out of here?
Go straight...straight
I said, go straight
Turn right
Right here
Then...?
- Left...
- Turn left
Turn on the lights
Whaaat?
Switch on the headlights
Hey! Watch out
Start the car
Let's leave this place
It's okay...go...go
Start the car...leave
You didn't expect, did you?
Didn't expect me
to come back, huh?
Especially not like this, right?
I’m here now
Now
It's my fucking game!
I won't do this again, sir
Forgive me, sir
All words, no work
Sendhil does his job
after giving what's due to me
Are you such a big shot?
Are you Goundamani?
I'll make sure it doesn't
happen again, sir
To download his stuff you said
Sendhil has already lined my pocket
Are you a by-pass for us?
I’ll pay whatever you ask
Isn't he promising
a better deal than him, sir?
Sasi, it isn't important
who gives the best deal
First is what counts
It means only the first guy
has full faith in us
Can we betray
the one who trusts us?
We shouldn't, right?
Since I'm already
committed to him...
...I've decided to divorce this one
Spare me just this once, sir
Yes, Ramya?
Antony died in an accident
Antony?
- When?
- Last night, sir
In his factory
I'm coming
Stupid of me to have trusted you
Even my fuel expenses
weren't covered
I was so happy minting money
with my gang of ghosts
You know Masss has earned much more
with spirits than producer C.V.Kumar
Just shut up, you scumbag
I'm so bloody mad
If only you were alive-
Why are you so tensed?
Whaaaat?
I have conned people,
robbed them but murder-
I've never even thought of murder-
Murder?
When did that happen?
Hey! Watch out
Even if I had been a human
that driver would have killed me
How will he know you'll jump?
Same way, how did I know he'll dart
in front of the car all of a sudden?
We aren't here to fight
But to become a millionaire!
Millionaire, huh?
Don't irritate me
You promised me 750 million
I didn't get a single rupee!
If you had got...
...you'd have vamoosed
taking the entire haul
Aiyaiyo...!
Masss, I didn't say anything
You thought you could ruin
my own plan and deceive me?
That's my money
Wherever it goes
only we have to loot it
Wait a moment
Knowing I'll cheat you out of it
why did you ask me to steal?
Your motive is not
to loot that locker?
Masss, you've got me all wrong
What was all that build up about
'my money 750 million' and 'hawala'-
And you took us to Sembikarai
Forget it, Masss
Let's go back to Chennai
We can mint money
with our gang of ghosts
We can globetrot to Singapore,
Malaysia and have fun-
Aiyayiyo!
Car...over heat
I go check the oil
Masss, hear me out
and then talk
I don't need to hear
 any of your lies
You planned it nice and proper,
made me kill for you
Happy now?
This guy looking very scary
I go hide
Don't even stand in front of me
What the-
Just go
I must face the consequences
Who will blame you?
Do you have someone to turn to?
Dad, whenever I ask you...
...you always say, 'I'll think about it'
Anu is very good
She's very good at magic
How many kids can boast
of a magician-mom, dad?
Please
Let's take her home, dad
Please, dad
Let's go home
and talk about this
No way, dad
Only if you accept her
 I'll talk to you
Mom has gone to heaven, right?
I'll ask her and
let you know
Don't lie, dad
Has mom ever talked to you?
She talks only to me
Let me ask her right now
Mom?
Mummy...!
Dad, mom said she likes her
She asked you to marry her
Hey! What happened to my Megha?
Don't carry me, dad
'Shakthi, what does Anu lack?'
'She loves you both very much'
'Megha won't get
a better mother than Anu'
Megha...?
Look at me
Princess, do you like her?
I love her very much, dad
My precious princess!
If my daughter likes her...
...so will her dad!
Aunty...?
Dad said 'yes'
Where is-
"I am not her"
"I am not the mother
of your daughter"
“In good looks or character
Any of these, I’m not her”
“I fell in love with you”
“Will you make me bloom
in your sky as the second moon?”
“Will you let me blossom?”
“From where she left you
I’ll continue her journey anew”
Dad, look...mom
“But love, honey
listen to my plea”
“In my heart where she rested
I hesitate to let you stay instead”
“But my love
let me say this now”
“The world my wife left behind
with you I’m trying to find”
“In my sky you snowed
as a silver lined cloud”
“Like the light blue sky gently
you spread into my heart perfectly”
“In my earth as a plant
you flowered permanent”
“Like the lush evergreen forest
you covered every inch of my heart”
“I smile again thanks to you
with a twinkle in my eyes true”
“I reopened my life
All because of you, my wife”
"Still in my past, as an outcast
I searched for the path I had lost"
“But my love so true
listen to my point of view”
“In my heart where she nestled
to let you settle..."
"To let you inside
to reside"
“Before belonging to me formally"
"You became my child’s mother informally”
“Before I could ask you why, my dear”
“You whispered with kisses in my ear”
“Into your lap you kidnapped me, darling"
"Weaving your fingers in my hair lingering”
“With your unconditional love, dear
my scars healed and disappeared”
Listen, dad
All my friends play with
their brothers and sisters, dad
Even I want to play like that
I want a little brother
or sister soon, dad
Go and ask your mom
Amma...?
I am okay
Our daughter's wish
"Darling, you are my everything"
"My silver moon wife"
"My soul mate for life"
"My dream without strife"
"You’re my world, darling
You’re my joy, my everything"
"You are my heart and heartbeat"
"Hereafter my journey complete"
"For ever after my world replete"
I'm in a meeting
I'll call later
Antony 'anna' passed away, bro
- When?
- Last night
1 minute
What are you saying?
Yes, bro
Antony 'anna' died in an accident
In his factory, bro
Accident?
We are not yet sure
if it’s an accident or murder
I've interrogated all the workers
No one is coming forward to complain
But we got information that Antony's car
is hidden near Ambuli lake
A car here has run over Antony
and vanished into thin air
Antony's car is hidden in a corner
on the banks of the lake over there
Executed with clockwork precision
Is it the handiwork of
an individual or a gang?
That is the question
Why was this factory
their specific target?
It seems Antony anna's locker has
neither the money nor any documents
Are you playing the fool?
How can it disappear?
Did you think the documents
were just blank papers?
Money amassed by the minister
for 25 years by trampling lives
Details of which container has what
and which ship carries it
Destination of that particular ship
Date of arrival
All the goddamn details are in there
Who has the guts to come
To Sembikarai and loot all this?
You think it is a local job?
Definitely, sir
Definitely not
- No?
- Yes
Maybe your parents named you Ramya
looking at your beautiful smile
Such a huge locker
Wonder what was stored inside?
Full of black money
If it gets into the wrong hands
Customs or harbor officials
We are done for
Don't worry
I'll handle it
Before I get back to India...
...it should be retrieved
Catch the thief also
Done deal
Sir, we can find out by
checking the CC TV camera
Is he running a software company?
He's up to his neck in deceit
As if he'll have a witness at hand
There's no CC TV in this factory
That's why I stuck this camera here
Sir, how did you manage that?
I spat a chewing gum here
and stuck it on top
I thought I could catch Antony
and milk the maximum out of him
Now I don't know which cow
will be the scapegoat to milk
Let's see if we find
Antony's killer
Like Manik Baashha, Robin Hood-Don
in 'Baashha', he may be captured in this
Who was on the phone?
Madhi had called
I wanted to ask you myself
What stage is our money in?
You've trusted me
It will be 100% alright
You finish our business deal
properly signed and sealed
Don't worry about the money
My responsibility
RK, I want this money in Delhi
before the election campaign starts
Because this is the only chance
for me to launder all of it
It will be delivered in the place
and time you specify
'Back' means rewind
Whom is he talking to
all by himself?
He isn't Antony's henchman
Nor does he belong to Sembikarai
But on the day Antony died
why was he in his factory?
Sir, his photo has matched
our Tamil Nadu police list
His name is Masilamani
He's in the accused list in Vyasarpadi,
Perambur and Thousand Light
But for some time now
he has been silent, sir
If such fellows are silent...
...they are planning
a heist in a large scale
Record this as just an accident
in our First Information Report
Okay, sir
She should say it
- Okay, sir
- I like that
Other than us, no one else should be
aware of this fellow's involvement
Who is he?
Where is he now?
Who is giving him the orders?
How is he connected with Antony?
We should go to Chennai
Only if they are happy
they can help us
You mean 'your' happiness!
- Look how happy our Jet is
- Did he tell you?
Because he doesn't rub
Masss sir the wrong way
That's why he is happy
Hey! What's the problem, Jet?
Boss, you go and freshen up
I'll convince all of them here
Shut up, man
Forever over acting
Me...over act?
Masss, they won't work
for us anymore it seems
They are going on a strike
Internal revolt
Hereafter we won't do
whatever you say
Fine with me
Given a chance you'll start
a separate union for spirits
Did I come looking for you?
You came after me
Jet, all this won't work
Chase all of them out
We bring fresh ghosts in tomorrow
We start a fresh business
We don't need anyone
who disobeys us
Tell them to get out
You heard it from your boss
Only the spirits who have
faith in us stay behind
Rest of you, get out!
Whether we should stay here or not...
...you shouldn't be deciding
We want to hear it from him
Who?
Turn and see for yourself
Hey! Didn't I tell you
not to see me ever again?
Why did you come here?
Hello...he didn't come
We called him
God above takes care of
the homeless and the needy
But abandoned spirits can
look up only to Mr Shakthi
Madam, our story was
going smooth, no?
Why this sudden
profound punch line?
Sonny, what she says
 is 100% true
They made use of us
and when we need help...
...they are kicking us out ruthlessly
Yes sonny, only you can
ask for justice on our behalf
Looks like you'll start off on
dialogs from yesteryear classics!
Get out if that's what you want
Don't create a scene, just go
- Masss?
- What?
We've just started earning
Imagine if we have
to find a fresh lot
And train those spirits all over
Do we need to go
into all that trouble again?
Bad enough we've killed
some stranger for him
Give it a thought, Masss
Should we pack them off?
Hey! Wait
Wait, you supernatural powers
If someone new calls you
you'll run behind him, huh?
Chinna...what?
Hey! Azhagu...?
Is our bond so shallow?
I thought we belong to
one big happy family
Sripathy...?
- Is our bond so flimsy?
- No, boss
- Be with him and do what?
- Don't know, boss
In the end only I'll come to your aid
Forget it, Masss
Do you know what he did?
He turned me into a murderer
He planned it and made me a killer
Selling salt to the sea, huh?
Now what?
You think I won't help
...and I'll cheat all of you?
That's your doubt?
Tell them
What should I do
and to whom?
Come forward, this is
priority for me now
Which one of you needs my help?
Padma, go
Elders or ladies?
Who is he to decide?
Ladies first
Tell me, madam
What should I do for you?
I want to see my son
"Braving chariotry, elephantry
cavalry and infantry"
"Like a tempest voluntary
he can strike with his gallantry"
"Like mountains massive
with his shoulders protective"
"With his bravery
he can wipe out the artillery"
Good life comes only after you die!
Enjoy, dude
A new South Indian lady in our area
What, my dear?
New to this area?
No
Who this fellow?
All these days I've been
 waiting to meet you
Promising to introduce them to you...
...I've been 'managing' many girls
in America, Canada, Holland
Hold on, I'll call them
Angelina...Amy
Already there are enough spirits
 waiting in the queue
We can deal with
 international ghosts in part 2
Hey! Shut up
I need a favor from you
This madam's son is missing
Name is Ganesh
Just a kid
I believe he's here in
 in this area somewhere
Have you seen him?
Wretched fellow!
Do you know Ganesh or not?
Move aside
As far as I know, in this area...
...my assistant Krishnamurthy
of 'Naan Kadavul' fame
...does big time business
with the handicapped
Her son Ganesh should be there
Follow me...come on
This place used to be
a paradise on earth
It's gone to the dogs now
Leave now
- Get up
- I'm hungry, bro
Eat at the place
where you beg
Is he your son Ganesh?
Is he your-
Here...eat
What happened to your hand?
A man-hole on the street
was left open yesterday
I slipped and fell inside
Bro, I'm hungry
Can I eat?
Eat
He can't even see
How can we leave him alone-
Where's his dad?
When he was born-
I had jaundice when I was young...
...and lost my eyesight
So my dad left me and my mother
If only I had been with him-
Hey! Stop it
Don't give excuses
You'll have a baby
because of your desires
Making up stupid excuses
Bro, what happened?
Silly excuses
Nothing...nothing
I got a call
Do you know how tough it is
to grow up as an orphan?
I'm also like him
'I was younger than him'
'We ate the food dumped
as waste by kids my age'
'Jet and I would sleep
wherever we found a place'
Easy to say 'would've taken
better care if I had been alive'
But you weren't with him
Look at him
Hunger
He's now begging
What's the rush?
Why the hell did you die?
Masss, let's go to Goa
- Why?
- Slow down
Why are you driving like this?
Ma...maa?
Ma, where are you?
Ma, say something
Ma...?
Please say something
Ma, where are you?
'I have robbed people
Even conned them'
'But I've never ever
 thought of murderin-'
I'll also be with him, doctor
Somehow restore his vision, doctor
Sister...sister...listen
Masss 'anna' has brought a blind boy
He is discussing about
treatment with Dr Deepak
That's it...gone!
He'll enact a drama
and cheat that doctor
- How is he?
- He's fine
He'll be able to see, I hope?
His optical nerves aren't damaged
It's okay whatever be the cost
If someone donates an eye for him...
...a simple surgery
can fix the problem
Who will donate an eye-
Don't worry
Nowadays many register
 their eyes for donation and die
If we can find a match
for his eyes...
...we can definitely
restore his vision
Please go to the reception
and finish all the formalities
- Please take care
- Sure, don't worry
Masss
I believe Ganesh will be
able to see very soon
Doctor told me just now
You don't worry
I swear I didn't do it deliberately
Why are you feeling guilty, Masss?
Even if I had been alive...
...I don't know if Ganesh
would've got his eyesight back
Maybe that's why I died
I trust you, Masss
You'll take better care
 of my son than me
I swear-
I am happy, believe me
I'm the one who should thank you
Please don't thank me
Madam...?
Don't go
Please stay
Madam...wait
Your son will be able to see...
...after all these years-
"With birth as the fishing tackle"
"With life as the worm to dangle"
Mass, what should we do now?
What you've done till now
 is more than enough
Tell me, whom should I help next?
"With death as a metaphor to sky"
"Before we sprout wings to fly"
"One last dying wish alone
to be realized we yearn"
'I must propose to the girl
 I fell in love with, Masss'
"This dream sequined
in whose eyes who has lined?"
This is my girl
I showed you her photo
"If it dissolves half way,
 won’t it continue to display"
"In heart’s dormitory
who has sown this memory?"
I want to kiss her, Masss
"Even if time tramples them
won't the cherished memories blossom?"
"With birth as fishing tackle
and life as a worm to dangle"
"Of our own accord we get lured
Listing a few wishes to be fulfilled"
"With death as a metaphor to sky
before we sprout wings to fly"
"One last dying wish alone
to be realized we yearn"
"The magic of the tear that dissolves
before it drops from the eyes' alcoves"
"Hurt and heart ache, smile eclipses
before the teardrop reaches the lips"
"Lost love in depths of sorrow immersed
when not promptly expressed"
"Kisses not imprinted, a zillion
wilted into vacillating oblivion"
The boy has got a match
We can operate at once
Probably in the next 2 weeks...
...he should be able to see very well
Knowing he'll be able to see...
...I'm more thrilled than him
Malini, in that application form...
... include sir's name as guardian
Wait here, I'll come back
with the papers
I need to talk to you alone
Why?
You wait here
 I'll be back
I have work to-
Sir... I need to talk to you
- Wait
- Sir...sir
I was the one who
donated my eyes to that boy
Oh! Thanks
Thanks a lo-
‘How much love we showered on you’
‘You've left us and gone now’
Thanks a lot, bro
My heart feels much lighter now
Why are you thanking me, sir?
My girl friend Manimekalai
is the main reason behind this
When she asked me to register
for organ donation...
...I was so scared!
But today when I know
 I saved so many lives...
...I feel so happy and proud, sir
I must to do something for you
Do you have any desires, brother?
After the boy's vision is restored...
...please take him to Manimekalai
If you tell her he is
seeing through my eyes...
...she'll be very happy
Definitely, I'll do that
Thanks, see you, sir
1 minute
You are going without seeing
 how happy Manimekalai will be
I know you'll do it
I'll anyway be seeing it
See you, brother
"With birth as the fishing tackle"
"With life as a worm to dangle"
"Of our own accord we got lured
Listing a few wishes to be fulfilled"
"With death as a metaphor to sky"
"Before we sprout wings to fly"
"One last dying wish alone
to be realized we yearn"
Don't cry, madam
I can't forget-
Take care
Call me anytime
I'm there for you
We'll take leave
See you, uncle
Malini...?
Someone I know-
I just met them here
Bye
So you won't talk to me, right?
Aren't you avoiding me?
Not like that
The other day in the hospital
I told you to wait for me
But you left
That means you don't
wish to speak to me
That day...some urgent work cropped-
You are not like before Masss
The moment you wanted
a blind boy to see...
...whom you've never set eyes on
...I knew how genuine you are
But only with me
you were so false
If you don't like me,
let me know, I'll go away
It isn't like that
I don't know how to explain
Do you know
how much I love you?
When you walked off
in a huff the other day...
...I wanted to slap you,
pull you close to me
...and kiss you
What stopped you?
What?
She's fine with it
What are you waiting for?
You are not the Masss I know
Slowed down too much in the 2nd half
This won't work
Start the music
Masss, what's his last wish?
To dance for his own death!
Maybe he fulfilled
his wishes when alive
That's why he went up
as soon as he died
This is what you term as 'good death'
Masss...Masss
You indecent fellow!
Why did you come here?
Cops have come in search of you
- Police?
- Yes
- Why are they here?
- I don't know
You go, I'll follow
Answer me
Sir, you haven't as yet
 asked me any question
Do you know Antony?
Anto-
Tell him you know editor Anthony
Antony-
If you look up, you can
see only an antenna, not Antony!
Antony...I don't know
So you don't know Antony
What are you doing nowadays?
I exorcise spirits, sir
What?
All these evil forces,
spirits, ghosts, ghouls...
...I talk to them and
 drive them away
Do they even exist nowadays?
Yes sir...then wha-
Ramya?
This is just a trick
to con people for money
Have you been to Sembikarai?
- Sembi...
- Karai
Sembikarai
I asked if you've been there?
Tell him you've been there
Tell him you went regarding a spirit
I haven't even heard that name, sir
So you've never been to Sembikarai
I'm saying I've never
even heard that name
Then how could I've gone there?
Can I get water please?
Sure, I'll get you
Masss, these guys look suspicious
Then it's your call
Take out the voice recorder
Go outside and keep it
 under the coffee table
What should I do, sir?
Shut up and watch out for him
Masss, underneath the table...
...they've fixed a voice recorder
I told you to tell them you went
Why did you say otherwise?
Hey! I know what to talk and when
You shut up and go
Girl, what's this?
I'm not a player in your game
Nosey parker!
Sir, he's here
No cold water, is it fine?
I'll come back again
You should serve me cold water then
Ramya, give him the number
- Not your number, but mine
- Sorry, sir
Hope you'll remember
If you're leaving the country...
...inform me before you go
Why, do you own a travel company?
Want water?
They've placed a wireless
mike underneath
Outside
Where?
Vikram, Assistant Commissioner of Police...
...has come to meet you
Ask him to drive us to our quarry
Bro, please sit
You look very familiar to me
Have we met before?
Not that I know of
Old age is catching up
So 'Ghajini' memory!
No, we've certainly met somewhere
It's possible
We meet a lot of customers
If you tell me who you are
and details about your work...
...I can jog my memory
See, I forgot to tell you that
My name is Madhivadhanan
Member of the Legislative assembly
I didn't know
Please sit
Looks like he doesn't watch television
Yeah, I don't
In the sub-collector murder case
in Kanchipuram...
...they suspected me
and put me behind bars
Masss, he seems like
 a big time murderer
Bro, I have total faith in God
If good exists then
 bad should also exist, right?
True
I also believe in ghosts
One of my friends
 died in an accident
Wretched fellow!
I don't know where he kept
his money and all the documents
That's why I'm in
a state of confusion
In my house for the past 2 days
something spooky is happening
Suddenly your number
 comes up on the mirror
I feel Antony 'anna' is trying to
say something through you
Just a minute
This is Antony 'anna'
Masss, you're dead meat
Call Antony's spirit and ask
where he's kept the cash and papers
You'll be truly blessed
You can do it, right?
Masss, otherwise
you'll be done for!
Give him some excuse
and escape from here
Good lord! Got trapped
in this chap's web
Why didn't you inform me
before coming here?
Ask him to get out of here
Thinks he's my savior!
For all the problems-
What did I do?
Whose plan is it to go
house to house and write numbers?
It's yours
You took us to Sembikkarai
and made us kill Antony
Problem now is not
about going to Sembikarai
But the missing money in the locker!
The locker number-
How can that money disappear?
We didn't steal it
We didn't but someone else did
He suspects you
That's why he has called you here
He's talking to spirits
Everyone is watching you
It isn't easy for you
to leave this place
If you listen to me,
I'll make you escape
Masss, if you listen to him
he'll end up like me!
Without realizing
the gravity of the situation...
...you're playing the fool
I know
I know that-
I don't know
Did you find out?
What did the spirit of
Antony 'anna' tell you?
Didn't see Antony's spirit
Since he died in Sembikarari...
...think the spirit is
 still roaming there
It's a spirit from out of town, right?
I couldn't bring it over here and talk
You're giving me a heart attack!
Shall we go to Sembikarai?
No...no
It won't work if we do that
I must perform a special prayer
It will take time
- It will take time?
- Yes, of course
RK 'anna' is on his way here
You start the prayer-session immediately
After RK 'anna' comes,
we can all go to Sembikarai
It isn't as easy as you think
It needs preparation time
It will take at least a week
I will pray specially for this
I'll keep you posted
Drop me
'Since he died in Sembikarari...'
'It's a spirit from out of town, right?'
Hey Mahesh?
Bro, you called?
Did anyone tell him
Antony 'anna' died in Sembikarai?
No, bro, I didn't tell him
Then how did he know?
He was talking to someone, bro
He even knows about the locker
Maybe that's why he escaped
He must have spoken
 to Antony anna's spirit
He's hiding something
Go and get him
Enough of doing good to all of them
Let's go to Bangkok
Many spirits there
are having a tough time
Come back
Boss wants to see you
Why?
I told you it will
take a week
He wants to discuss it
with you, come back
Aiyaiyo! It's getting late for me
Too many customers waiting
Tell him I'll come another day
Drop me if you don't mind
Hey! What's all this?
Why are you ganging up like this?
- Where's the money?
- Which money?
Don't act smart
Where is the money
I gave Antony 'anna'?
How will I know?
Mr Antony never turned up
So he knows only the fact
Antony 'anna' died in Sembikarai, huh?
Sir...that...it's not what you think
Masss, game over
They know all about you trying to
steal from the locker in Sembikarai
The question now is...
...will they finish you?
Or will you close their chapter?
Hey! Don't think you can
fool me a 2nd time, okay?
Whom are you playing with?
Aren't you talking to Antony 'anna'?
If you don't tell us
where you've stashed it...
...I swear you're dead meat!
If you don't let me go
your life is in danger
You have the gall to
 threaten me in my area?
Sir, listen to me
I swear I don't know anything
How dare you deny it!
Okay, fine
You don't seem to understand, sir
RK 'anna' is on his way
I'll pickle you to pieces
Why don't you liste-
Because you're a big shot
I made allowance for you
Go and make him sit
in cool comfort
I'm warning you repeatedly
that your time isn't good
“Flying lean and mean in mid-air”
“Rays of gold gleam and glitter”
“Zip zap zooms to surpass”
Where is the money?
Don't create problems
Trying to con me?
Are you dumb or what?
Won't you listen?
Let's run...quick
You got no brains?
How many times to tell you?
Where is the money?
Hey! What happened?
Lie on the floor
Masss, get some water
What the hell did you give?
Save me
Fire is spreading
Lie down
I'll stamp it out
Lie on the floor
Masss, escape
The whole place will
burn now, you go
I am telling you to go
Fire is spreading
Masss!
Don't you remember?
Shakthi...!
Shakthi?
You thought it was all over?
Shakthi will come in any form
No one can destroy me
I'll use him to kill all of you
Son of a mongrel!
Save me...!
Masss, you haven't left?
You made me a fool
once more, no?
You'll use me to kill people?
What are you blabbering?
First, get out from here-
Why?
How many people
will you kill using me?
You're using me again
and again for your cause
Go away from here
Be a little patient
Ask him to go
Why are you torturing him?
If you won't even let me speak-
How many more lies?
Did I spoil your flashback?
Looking at your face so often...
...I hate to look
at myself in the mirror
Go...just go away from my sight
You've got it all wron-
Didn't you hear me?
Masss, don't
I'll slit my throat myself
One more word and I die
Only if I am alive
you can use me
If I am dead?
Shall I slit my throat?
DON'T!
Then go
GO
I'll leave
Whole place is burning
Someone may come now
You leave immediately
How did you land here?
Grab him
Get into the car
Listen to me
Come
Get in now
I'm in no way connected to them, sir
It's all because of...
...Shakthi!
Shakthi?
He isn't Shakthi
His name is Masss
I saw him in Sembikarai factory
on the day Antony 'anna' died
He killed Antony in Sembikarai
He killed the MLA also, sir
He was present there when
2 people known to you died
On top of it,
 the death penalty prisoner...
...Kamal Ekambaram was also there
What is the connection
between you two?
Stop it
Do you know who Shakthi is?
As if I care
Why does he keep torturing me?
He's your father
Your dad
'I was the only family friend
for your mother in India'
'Your mother lived in Canada'
'Her dearest dream was to donate
 her land in India to an orphanage'
'I made all the arrangements'
'And I asked them to come
 to India to register the land'
'We went to the orphanage
as soon as they landed'
'When we reached-'
Madam, how could you
go back on your word?
'You came forward and offered to
give your land for our orphanage'
But now you've registered the land
to some construction company
Kamal 'anna', what is she saying?
'When we were in a dilemma
not knowing what to do...'
'...we came to know about RK
and Antony, 2 real estate sharks'
'If they set their eyes on a land...'
'...they would stoop
 to any level to grab it'
'But because your father was
a police officer with integrity...'
'...we went straight to
the registrar's office'
But Anuradha's death certificate
 has been submitted here
Whaaat?
You go straight to
 the Canadian embassy
Get an authenticated certificate
that you are Anuradha
'Before we could digest
such a deception...'
'...RK and Antony landed there'
Good afternoon
My name is Shakthi
I actually wanted to
meet you in person
By mistake you seem to have placed
your company board on our land
Your accent is different
Are you from Ceylon?
Tamilian...!
They are my friends
'While we were talking
things got out of hand'
Some goddamn foreign jackass
is claiming the land to be his!
After some time, will make up
stories saying they hit him
When the husband was away
they misbehaved with the wife etc
Shakthi!
How dare you!
Shakthi...no
If we come from abroad, you think
we'll sightsee, take snaps and...
...run back home,
scared of your vile threats?
Sacrificing his land...
...and without any identity of his own
...he lives in some corner of this world
Do you know his pain?
How long will he be a 'yes man'
to your wrong doings?
A savior has to come
'Finally your father took the decision'
We'll register the land
'Because we needed
local police support also...'
'...we went and registered
a written complaint also'
Many have complained
against them, sir
But no one has given it in writing
I'll handle it
'Next day we were waiting
 for the registrar's arrival'
Sir, they're here to
create some trouble
I'm here, right?
I'll handle it
Let's not create any problems
We'll adjust in our present premises
Inform sir
I've gathered everyone here
 just as you asked me to
There's no written complaint
You do what is necessary
Aren't you the stowaway
who escaped in an illegal boat?
You think you'll save this land?
Did you notice something?
From the beginning hasn't this
land been torturing us?
Yes, you're right
Maybe a human sacrifice
will rectify it
Yes, Radha
Shall we start with that kid?
Madam, come away
Go
I can't-
Shakthi
Go away
Shakthi?
Both of you run from here
Hey! Catch hold of her
Megha...wait
You go somewhere safe
Watch your step
Here you are
Hold your little brother
Hold on to him firmly
- You come, mom
- I will, you go
Be careful with the baby
Anu...!
Take care of my little brother
Don't know whose baby this is
Someone has left him here
Is anyone there?
Megha, come here
Hurry up
Mom...?
Megha?
Meghaaaa
Don't do this...no
Don't...please
Please
Let me go
Shakthi...!
What shall we do with him, bro?
He killed the entire family
wanting to usurp all the money
You caught him
We are your witnesses
Close the case
You could have told me, right?
That you are my dad
You could have told me
I intended to
But you said, if I talk
of relationship...
...you'll show your Hyde side
And asked me to
stand in a queue
I didn't know-
Only when I mentioned
the word 'money'...
...you gave me a second look
I didn't know-
Anu...Megha
Anu...?
Money blinded me
I didn't even know my dad
who was next to me
If only I had known
our family's plight right then-
I'd have massacred them
Who?
Tell me
Tell me, dad
Tell me now
How many should I kill?
Masss
Don't underestimate me
I knew when Kamal Ekambaram
escaped from prison
That someone is backing him up
He'd have given you graphic details...
...of  how I killed
your sister, mother and father
Your family was the foundation
for me to build my kingdom
I don't believe in leftovers
in any job I undertake
But only in your case
it somehow got missed
That damn kid duped me
Otherwise I'd have killed you
that very same day
Do you know how many families
 like yours are buried in my garden?
I vaguely remember your father's face
But I've forgotten  his name
I admitted all the boys
 in the hospital
But...we looked everywhere
Couldn't find Masss alone
Take as many men as you want
I need Masss alive
He has important documents of mine
RK...?
You can go
Greetings, boss
What happened to Madhi?
Madhi-
...died in a fire accident in our quarry
When the rocks explode-
I know everything
Antony and Madhi who
knew about the container...
...have both died
when we were abroad
You hid that information from me
Election work has started
I must get that money
within the next 48 hours
If I don't get...
...the consequences are
 well known to all
Don稚 spoil our friendship
that has lasted so long
Please come
Dad?
- Dad...?
- Masss?
Jet...?
Masss?
Jet...?
Lie down
- Masss, I'm here
- Don稚 strain
- Masss...?
- I can稚 see my dad
I知 right here, Masss
Where did you disappear, dad?
Malini, I知 not able to see them
- Jet...?
- Masss
No one is here, Masss
Just me and Ekambaram
No, Malini
My dad, Jet-
Listen to me, Masss
Usually I can see them
Masss, don't strain
If you take rest
you'll be fine
Malini, make him lie down
Dad, where are you?
They are all here
but I知 unable to see them
Just give me a minute
Malini, I can't see my dad
Hey! Jet...?
Where did you go, dad?
I know they are all here
I can稚 see them, Malini
I want to talk to Jet
I can't see them
Hey Sripathy
Masss, I知 here
We are all here
Why am I not able to see them?
I want to see my dad
He needs me, sir
What happened to me, Malini?
How come suddenly I can't see them ?
Hey! Jet...?
How could you leave me?
Malini, quick
- Dad...?
- Relax, Masss
What has happened to Masss?
Sripathy...Azhagu
Hereafter, Masss can't...
...see any of us
All of them will be
with me always, sir
What are you saying?
Power acquired from one accident
Got lost in another accident
Calm down, please
Can't see, Malini
Where is my dad?
He was with me
Jet, I致e been fulfilling
everyone's last wishes
But I didn稚 ask you at all
What痴 your last desire?
I don稚 have anything
specific like that
I have no one but you
I want to always be with you
And torture you!
One tight slap
- You can't hit me!
- Tell me something
Such a madcap
Jet...?
You are here, right?
Aren't you right here?
Remember one day
you asked me?
'Is this how you talk
to your dead friend?'
It hurts me now, dude
DAI...dad...?
Where are you?
After I knew you are my dad...
... I知 not able to see you!
Masss?
Nothing...I'm fine
Listen, Masss
750 million is right here
You and Malini take it
And live happily together
I致e told her the whole story
Your dad also will want
 to see you happy
No, he won't like it, sir
Dad, you won't like it, right?
I must kill RK, dad
I must kill him
with my own hands, right?
Did you see that?
I must do the honors!
My dad wants me to
No, Masss
Antony, Madhi, RK
and the commissioner
I escaped from jail
only to kill them
That's why I killed the commissioner
2 out of the 3-
I killed them not knowing
who they were, sir
I even fought with my dad
because of that, sir
I yelled at him
Till my throat went hoarse, sir
Now I should kill him knowingly
Only I should kill him
'I somehow missed your case alone'
'That brat of a kid duped me'
'Otherwise I'd have killed you
that very same day'
'Just like your family...'
'...do you know how many
 are buried in my garden?'
'I vaguely remember your father's face'
'But I don't know his name'
'You don稚 know
your father痴 name, right?'
Looks like if we dig your garden...
...we can find cases
full of unsolved cases
If I should ignore all this...
...you'll be wasting time
 reporting to the Commissioner
Let me know how much
commission I値l get
I値l give you 200 million
I want Masss
I want all my documents from him
Need the original
 of this recording
I致e already planned it to the T
How to chop Masss into pieces
And produce him before you
Hey!
Grab him
No one should call me
a cop who didn稚 grab, right?
That's why
Take this as bribe
and board him into the jeep
I arrested Ekambaram, RK
Masss isn稚 here
Got all the documents
Where is the container?
Krishnapattinam port
Andhra Pradesh
To have Ekambaram alive
and in our custody...
...till we get the money in
 our hands is the safest measure
I致e briefed all the details to Naresh
Open it
Those who want to be alive...
...run away from here
this very minute
Being all alone
you're threatening me?
Where is the money?
Who the hell told you...
...I'm single?
Hey! Let's take him
Are you showing me
your magic tricks?
Where have you kept the money?
Hey! Don稚 shoot him
Where's the money?
If you don稚 answer
 your head will shatter to pieces
You can now shoot him
make Masss-soup and enjoy
There痴 750 million here
Deal is okay now
Where should I bring RK?
If RK should trust you...
...first arrest Ekambaram
in the place I tell you
I値l give you much more
than what he gave you
Sorry, RK
Instead of the best deal...
...first come first served is my preference
Pretended to be a good cop
and tricked me
Who told you I'm good?
Blackie, crush him
Why are you lifting that door?
Hey! That man can see us!
Watch out, he will kill you
with his nonstop chatter
We need you to lend us
your right hand
Who is dead here
for us to do funeral rites?
We are dead and roaming around
Then why is it you're so pathetic-
Why are you hitting me from behind?
Strange...I hit him and
 these chaps disappeared?
Where have you gone?
Where痴 our hero?
He痴 fighting
a solo battle
Let me contribute
my 2 penny bit
Poor thing!
He痴 forgotten he is a hero too
Who is this?
Hey! Who is making
the 'Premgi mudra'?
How atrocious is this?!
Disgusting!
Who the hell are you?
Dirtied my hands so much
Won't I do this for you?
Dad, are you watching?
Dad, you池e watching, right?
Watch me now
You're watching, right?
You wanted to know
my father痴 name?
My dad is Shakthi
Didn't I tell you?
I'll kill him with my hands
You just relax and watch
Come here
Dad...?
"Get set at Jet speed en Massse"
"Sky rocket to Jet out and aMasss"
"In tip top style to cover
Hither and thither world over"
"Zip zap zooms to surpass
Earns 100% applause"
"Seas and shores he encompasses
This Masss is for the masses"
"Here...hereafter, wait and watch
In fact he has the Midas touch"
Hello, sir
The Oscar award goes to-
What's up, sir?
You'll get it from me
