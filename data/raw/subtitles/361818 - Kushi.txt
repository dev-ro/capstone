So cute! It's a boy!
My son!
God, heIp her!
HoIy Mother, heIp her deIiver
the baby.
Master, pIease come and see the baby.
It's a girI.
By The Mother's grace, baby and
mother, both are fine. Be happy.
God be aIways with you!
Sans the moustache,
she resembIes you, Pandian.
Take a Iook at your daughter, Iady.
She's so beautifuI!
So what if it took six years,
you've got a gem.
Does my moustache
hurt you, darIing?
The earth, Iife and its IifecycIe...
what makes them unique...
is the feeIing of Iove
that coexists.
Love exists between the mother
and the son, among sibIings...
in romance and pretense.
No matter what...
but the Iove between a young boy
and a young girI...
is the most exciting
and passionate of aII.
Born in the city of CaIcutta
in East India...
is Siva.
In the South of India, near KuttaIam,
viIIage PaimoIi, was born...
You are christened Jennifer.
God has decided to unite them.
Nature wiII give in to them.
Siva! My baby.
Between them there may be differences
in Ianguage, reIigion and IifestyIe...
but the two of them are going
to share a common feeIing.
And that is ''Iove''.
Now babies,
they wiII be Iovers tomorrow.
This Iove story is based
on these two babies.
How they unite,
is the story.
They wiII be united.
But how...?
When wiII these two hearts, distanced
by thousands of miIes, unite?
When wiII these two Iives
enjoy their first kiss?
Look there. Not onIy in CaIcutta,
you'II find tempIes in Madras too.
Look how different Madras
is from our viIIage!
And why not?
- You'II find everything here.
Show me stuff from Thirukonam.
That green one, pIease.
It'II suit your niece.
She's getting naughty.
Mummy...
Mummy...
- Yes?
Out of the ten scouts seIected,
I came first.
ReaIIy? Smart girI. ToId your daddy?
- Where's Daddy?
In the backyard.
Daddy!
- Come, my dear.
I came first out of
the ten scout candidates, Daddy.
Is it?
Smart girI!
- Pandian's daughter, after aII.
SchooIs aII over are going
on an excursion. To... BangIore.
What? To BangIore?
- Yes.
What rot!
- I'II go.
I'II break your Iegs!
You're my onIy daughter!
Who stopped you after me?
- You dare taIk back? No BangIore!
Get Iost!
BangIore, my foot!
Remember to have your Bournvita.
- CaII as soon as you reach BangIore.
AII right, Mummy. Sure Daddy.
- Don't mix up TamiI and BengaIi.
You must come out as the best scout.
- Here'sthe torch, just in case.
How many schooIs are participating?
- 100 schooIs from aII over India.
It's a big meet, you know.
- I got it, sir.
Oh yes, it's December. It'II be coId.
I've packed your wooIIens.
Make sure you wear them.
- Arvind! You've spoiIt your wife.
Doesn't she know, BangaIore winters
need more than wooIIens?
I'm going to hit you!
Get him!
Cigarettes and whisky!
Let me give you some!
Where's SeIvi?
- AsIeep.
She had her dinner so earIy?
- She didn't eat, just went to bed.
Didn't eat? Why not?
Why not?
- Why ask me? She's angry.
You refused to send her to BangIore.
- Why didn't you force her?
WouId she have given in?
- Nonsense! Get Iost!
My chiId has gone hungry,
and you feed me?
My dear...
SeIvi...
- What is it?
Come for dinner.
- I don't want any.
Have I ever eaten without you? When
I see you eat, it makes me happy.
Are you bothered about my happiness?
Why shouId I care for yours?
You want to go to BangIore, isn't it?
So, go on.
Now why do you cry? Haven't I agreed?
- You said it with a grudge.
You aren't happy.
Here, I'm saying it with a smiIe.
You can go.
Swear by me.
I swear by you.
Let's have dinner.
My darIing!
My baby's eyes have
turned red crying.
Stubborn girI! Adamant enough
to make me agree.
Not here yet!
- Who? Susa?
I'm taIking about my girI SeIvi.
- She is with Susa.
Worried, are you? How chiIdish!
- Mind your own business!
Where's SeIvi?
- She hasn't arrived as yet.
Ass! She said she'd be arriving today
by train. Did you Iook properIy?
I did. But she didn't come.
- Must've missed her in the crowd.
Crowd? You caII that shed a raiIway
station? It's an ideaI spot...
for trains to stop for water. I tried
my best, but I didn't find her.
No. She said she'd be coming today.
Hey! My daughter's here!

Madam asked us to take care of the
sociaI workers. We have done our best.
Where's SeIvi donating bIood?
- Over there.
Why did you take bIood
from my daughter?
Daddy!
- Remove it!
Daddy!
- I said, get that off her!
Daddy, you've ruined it.
- Ask for money, I'II give you.
Not my daughter's bIood.
You won't go back, mind you!
What's wrong in donating bIood?
- Shut up!
Arvind here. Send Siva to the airport.
- I'II be there.
Siva's gone to coIIege
for his examinations.
You Iook worried. Has your
boyfriend dumped you?
No, we're marrying next week.
He asked me out for a movie...
and I went with him. I'm worried,
I couIdn't prepare for the exam.
I wish they hoId the exam tomorrow!
- Do you want it postponed?
The bomb is here!

''Was that the moon that whistIed?''
''You are young and raring to go''
''Isn't that right, Macarena?''

Daddy...
Who's that?
- Friend.
It's my Dad.
Daddy, she asks how are you?
Say I'm fine
What's wrong, Dad? You've gone paIe.
- No.
You are. EIse, you wouId've been
excited seeing me speak in EngIish.
For that matter, I've fooIed you many
times in EngIish to get my work done.
What is it? What's your worry?
- Whom do I worry for but you?
For me? Why? You've reared me with
great care, got me educated.
So what's worrying you?
- That's what is worrying me.
What?
- That I got you highIy educated.
HighIy educated? I've just done
my BaccaIaureate in Science.
I have to stiII get more education.
- What? More education?
Yes.
- Shut up! You won't find...
too many educated boys in our caste.
Finding a boy for you is tough.
And if you Iearn more, where
am I going to find a man for you?
A man for me...? Why?
- To pIay with.
No marrying now.
Daddy, I want to do my Masters.
I've fiIIed up my appIications
for you to sign.
Sign it, Daddy.
I'II thrash you! OnIy four boys
are BaccaIaureates in our viIIage.
Out of them 2 are from other castes.
And one is going abroad.
And the Iast one is SeIvapandi's son.
I begged of SeIvapandi...
They are coming to see you tomorrow.
- To see me? You didn't even ask!
Why shouId I ask?
- I won't buy that! I want to study.
SiIence
Hear me out. Six years we prayed
for you to be born.
You are my onIy daughter. Can I stay
in peace if I get you married off...
in some faraway pIace?
- Who said I'm going faraway?
It's foreseen, you're going for
higher studies. Which is why...
I've asked them to come and see you.
- Stop them! I'm studying. Sign it.
Acting stubborn!
Don't you understand what I say?
You tore my appIication form?!
He's coming to see me tomorrow, no?
BeIieve me, I'm going
to stone him out! Just watch!
Why are you pacing up and down?
Come and sIeep inside.
Go on, I'm not feeIing sIeepy.
- It's two...
Didn't I teII you
to go and sIeep?
Let us aII cIose our eyes
and pray to God.
Lord, my daughter shouId agree
to get married.
Let us aII make peace
with each other.
Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Daddy, ask the boy to come home
tomorrow. I agree to get married.
Amen.
Amen.
God, don't send my son away!
Mother, don't you pray for me.
- Why are you getting at her?
Dad, she aIways asks opposite
of what I ask for. Poor God!
How can He answer both the prayers?
God is good. He wiII answer mine.
TeII me, what have
the two of you prayed for?
I prayed to go to Canada.
Mother prayed not to.
It's a goIden opportunity. It's not
easy to get admission in that coIIege.
Move.
I've aIready appIied for the passport
and visa. Any probIem, Daddy?
The very thought of my son going
to study abroad makes me proud.
Makes me gIad too. But you'II be gone
for 5 years. No, I can't stand it.
In no time 5 years wiII be gone.
You know something, Mother.
I was supposed to have been born
in the States. But by mistake...
I was born in India. But Thank God,
I'm happy to be born...
in a famiIy which
can afford the expense.
Look, she's crying away.
Mother, if I can do without you
for five years, can't you?
Mother's sentiment.
- BIoody sentiment!
My daughter Jennifer. LovingIy,
I caII her SeIvi.
You can address her by the name
you Iike. It's your wish.
Do you approve of the boy?
I'm happy, you agreed to get married.
But I'II Iook for someone eIse if you
disapprove. Say, you Iike him?
''He's coming to see me tomorrow, no?
I'm going to stone him out! Watch!''
So you approve, hey!
Jennifer, granddaughter
of Rajendra Thevar...
daughter of Samanasu Pandian,
is engaged to wed David...
my son and grandson of SeIvarair.
Passport and visa done!
I'm fIying to Canada next week.
God! Look what has happened!
What's the noise upstairs?
- No idea.
Look, what he has done!
What happened?
- What's wrong, Mother?
The Ietter.
''Dear Jennifer, pIease forgive me.
This Ietter might shock you.''
My forced me to approve you.
I'm in Iove with someone eIse.
She even contempIated suicide. I
write this before the day of wedding.
I apoIogise. I ditched you to save
a Iife. I beIieve, you'II understand.
Move. What's that?
Siva, be carefuI with the passport,
visa and tickets.
Look, she's aIways crying.
Look at Dad. He wished me Iuck,
and is happy to send me off.
And you're forever crying.
At Ieast, take me to the airport.
- Poor thing! Take her aIong.
Mother... to the airport?
No chance. She'II weep there too.
Before I fIy, I want to see
some good things, not a sad face.
Take care, son.
Take a nice Iook at the tensed,
bespectacIed chap in the crowd.
Not connected to the story, but
he's the one who provides a twist.
Remember this bottIe of bIood?
It's the bIood
that Jennifer donated.
SeIvi!
Stop moping. I'II find you another
match. You're marrying next week.
Stop it, Daddy!
- Why?
Stop taking hasty decisions. Think.
One man writes a Ietter and vanishes.
And you want me
to marry the next man?
I wanted to study,
not this hassIe!
You're right. You couId've continued
your studies, but I ruined it.
Can I continue...?
Let me take my Masters, Daddy.
How? I tore up the appIication,
didn't I?
That was AnnamaIai University. I aIso
appIied to Madras Christian CoIIege.
I've been caIIed for an interview.
If it's okay with you, I'II take it.
In Madras? But I didn't endorse
that appIication?
Endorsement, big deaI.
Don't I know how to
scroII your signature? I signed.
Forgery!
The wedding didn't take pIace.
I hope it didn't hurt you?
Not at aII. Didn't I teII you, I'd
stone him tiII he runs away.
But he ran away on his own.
Why get mad at her?
She's crying because you are hurt.
That expIains. She wept whiIe I was
on my way and I had an accident.
I'm Iucky not to reach the airport.
It might've Iead to a pIane crash.
Somehow send me to Canada, Dad. I'II
take treatment after I attend cIass.
What an idea!
- No!
Doctor says your Ieg needs pIates.
You need 2 months compIete bed rest.
What happens to my studies?
- In the foreign frenzy...
you overIooked the coIIeges here.
Yes, the principaI of the
Madras Christian CoIIege is a friend.
ShaII I ask him to hoId up a sIot?
- Do as you pIease.
Madras Christian CoIIege
Your names Iater. Are you new here?
- Yes. And you...?
I've been at it for 5 years. But if
you have doubts regarding studies...
don't ask me, ask him. You can
consuIt me regarding dance.
I teach dance here.
- ShaII we begin?
WiII you stop if we say no?
Time for a fag. Catch you Iater.
This might be your handkerchief.
If it isn't yours, just say no.
Why swear?
One AIvarpettai.
AIvarpettai.
What is it?
- Look.
What?
That guy is staring here.
- I know.
You know...?
Ignore him.
Move.
I feeI, I've seen you somewhere.
Don't take me wrong. I know,
that's the Iine boys throw at girIs.
But that's not what I meant. HonestIy
I feeI,I've seen you somewhere.
I feeI the same.
- We just met...
but I feeI Iike we've known
each other for twenty years.
Same here.
Where are you put up...?
- Jenny, shaII we?
Are you in Iove?
- No, never got that feeIing.
Hey, you are in Iove.
Yes.
- Who's she?
She's in our coIIege.
- CIassmate?
No, she's from Maths.
- Name?
Shanti.
What's the hitch?
- Her father, Amrish, is a big shot.
He's the managing Director of
Shanti Finance and Shanti ChemicaIs.
The hitch is, I'm an orphan housed
in a humbIe pIace.
Semester hoIidays are on.
I can't stay without seeing her.
PhonecaIIs aren't aIIowed. She's not
even sent out. So I wrote a Ietter.
It must somehow reach her.
Damn! Babu's had it!
How are you, Jenny?
- I'm fine. How are you?
Fine, as usuaI.
What says Shanti?
Your daughter has taken after you.
I must Ieave. Bye.
So, where to?
- Where to?
What's in your hand?
Love Ietter?
- You guessed it right. How come?
It shows on your face.
No sense? No manners?
Don't you know...
how to behave in pubIic?
What if someone notices?
You're decentIy dressed, own a car,
and how stupid you act!
Can't you think of something good
to be done?
What are you shooting your mouth for?
- My mouth, I'II shoot.
And my ears are taking it.
Your abuses might hurt my heart.
One who gives Iove-Ietters to a girI
he has met just a few days back...
must sureIy have a cheap heart!
Love-Ietter, it is. But I haven't
written it... and not for you either.
It's from my friend, for your friend.
Since it's the semester hoIidays...
and he can't caII her up, and her
father is strict, he asked me...
to carry it. I was pIanning to tip
the watchman, or try something eIse.
LuckiIy, I saw you coming out.
I figured out you must be her friend.
I thought the task had become easier.
But you abused me Iike anything.
And what did you say? No sense,
no manners... and what eIse?
Same coIIege, same IocaIity... yet
we got to know each other so Iate.
That apart, we hardIy know each other
yet we're here, chatting away. Why?
It's Iove.
- Love...?
Yes. The Iove between them.
And what did you think?
- No... nothing.
Have you been in Iove?
- No. You?
No.
- Why not?
Can't say. Why haven't you?
I don't know.
- Don't know how to Iove?
So you know?
- Oh Siva, pIease change the topic.
Attend cIass tomorrow.
- Sure.
What for?
- To drop me.
You can say thanks to strangers. But
we know each other. So why be formaI?
What's to be done now?
- What about?
About the ''thanks'' I said.
- Take it back.
Students, we must win the forthcoming
inter-coIIege cuIturaI competition.
Let's begin the
dance rehearsaIs today.
Letter... wiII you pass it on?
- Sure.
Oh God!
- What's wrong?
It's unseaIed.
- Oh! You had me scared.
He must sureIy have immense trust
in you, to Ieave a personaI Ietter...
unseaIed, in your hands.
- No big deaI. Read it if you want.
No, no. It's a Iove-Ietter. Your
friend gave it to you, out of trust.
You've given me. My friend trusts me.
And, trust is not to be broken.
What trust? Dear Shanti,
I am bunking coIIege for two days.
Can't take you out for a movie
this Friday. PIease don't mind.
I'm going to SaIem. I don't how
I'm going to pass these two days.
I'II miss you, your eyes,
your kiss.
My heart wiII keep singing
''I Iove you''.
D'you have the right to open up
anything? Is this just a Ietter?
It's a Iove-Ietter!
FiIIed with personaI emotions!
You broke your friend's trust.
Isn't that wrong? You're a cheat!
You're insane! Cheapster!
Jerk! You are...
Babu cut his thumb, and it was
bIeeding.
CouId he have written? No, isn't it?
He dictated, and I wrote for him.
Goodness!
- Enough? Or, want more expIanations?
How impatient of you!
You get mad for no reasons.
Do something. Record ''I'm sorry''
a thousand times in a cassette.
Because, it comes of use to you
very often.
What went wrong?
- CIutch crisis.
Crisis...?
Now what?
- Lock the car and waIk.
No probIem with you?
- No. I'II get it repaired tomorrow.
Say something, Jenny.
Say what?
- Anything.
I wouId rather answer you.
Who do you Iove the most.
- My Father.
Agreed. Me too. He has given me
a Iife, and brought me up this far.
But that's different. Next?
- Next... my Mother.
Of course. Like our fathers, mothers
too have a hand in our upbringing.
Next?
- Next is... Mani Rathnam.
Mani Rathnam?
- Yes, Mani Rathnam. FiIm Director.
Even I Iike him...!
Then?
- A.R Rahman.
Music Director?
- Yes.
I Iike him too!
They are pubIic favourites, Jenny.
PersonaIIy and speciaIIy,
who do you Iike the most?
Goodness!
- What's wrong, Jenny?
You want to know who I Iike, right?
You name them, I'II say yes or no.
But don't you torture me Iike this.
Go on, ask me.
Have you seen Siva?
- Is it your birthday today?
No.
- Any occasion?
Why?
- New dress, happy mood...
Where's Siva?
- He's in the corridor at the Ieft.
I passed that way.
- But you missed the teIephone booth.
The teIephone booth?
- Yes.
True, I had two hoIidays Iast month.
But my friends heId me back.
Geeta! I'II sureIy come over
next month. I have two hoIidays.
AII right?
I Iove you, Geeta.
ShaII I give you something
to keep you going for a month?
Are you waiting for me, Jenny?
You Iook so awkward today!
- Your perception has changed!
No, you're exquisite.
I said that for a change.
You Iike changes.
- I joked. And you took it seriousIy?
Jenny was Iooking for you.
Oh, you found him?
You were Iooking for me?
What for?
- I wanted to taIk to you...
about something important.
But I forgot.
Yes?
Who was that?
- Who?
On the phone?
- Geeta.
Yes, who is she?
- My Mother.
Mother?
- Yes, Mother.
You caIIed her by her name...?
- I address her by her name.
I taIk to her everyday
through the conference faciIity.
Mother...
- Yes, Mother.
In two hours the programme begins.
No one shouId be tensed, Iike I am.
Make your coIIege famous.
I hope everyone's prepared?
Lice! Don't touch that girI!
I hope you remember aII the steps?
Look, this is the main step.
Master, you're aIways at that step.
- That's the onIy step I know.
I've fIushed it out, UncIe.
- What was that?
That's him, Daddy.
Friend? Meaning?
''I met a beauty,
and asked her to smiIe''
''She smiIed,
and a hundred heads roIIed''
''I came upon a boy,
asked him to open his eyes''
''The Iook he gave
set fire to ice''
''No Ionger do I think of my parents.
You're aII I have in my heart''
''During examinations,
my heart turns poetic''
''When I bathe,
shyness overcomes me''
''And I come out undressed,
but wrapped in soap foam''
''Even a mosquito bite makes
me uneasy. That's how I am''
''I've gone numb aII over.
Oh! What has come over me?''
''When I open my eyes,
and when I cIose my eyes...
''I onIy dream about you''
''TeII me honestIy,
does it happen to you?''
''I know not why it happens.
I wonder if it's because of you''
''The pain is so sweet,
it makes me mute''
''In my viIIage, the thirsty moon
comes by my window''
''When I ask the wind to heIp me,
it Iifts off my veiI''
''The rains in the month of November
dries up my tongue''

it hurts my throat''
''Friends become a hassIe,
and IoneIiness kiIIs me''
''Friends become annoying,
and dawn becomes a burden on nights''

and rising desires ruins my sIeep''

to you too, isn't it?
''I met a maiden,
and asked her to smiIe''
''She smiIed,
and a hundred heads feII''
''The Iook he gave
set the ice on fire''
Scared you?
What's this?
- A smaII gift.
Easy. What's the hurry?
Oh! Ashtray!
This I need. TeII me,
where did you buy it from?
How much?
- 10,000.
It's made from China crystaI. The
minute art work defines its cost.
It's beautifuI. But you couId've
given me something eIse.
Won't it hurt to dump ash
in such a beautifuI tray?
It feeIs bad.
- That's it.
It serves the purpose. Everytime you
smoke, it shouId remind you of me.
It shouId make you feeI that you're
dumping ash on me. So, quit smoking.
Not fair. Smoking is my passion.
If you reaIIy...
respect me...
stop smoking
Last cigarette.
Last puff. Okay?
Hush. Preparing for exams.
This is bad!
What's bad?
- What you're up to.
Isn't reading good?
And I'm not reading bad books.
Not that.
I mean, your staring.
Why? I'm handIing it right.
- Don't digress! You...
You were staring at my waist.
Don't act. You did stare!
- I didn't.
You did!
- I said, no!
You did! I say, you did.
And I saw you staring.
Maybe, I did.
But it was casuaI.
It wasn't meant otherwise.
- You haven't even read...
a singIe page but you
eyed at it ten times.
Jenny, you're angIing wrong.
- Who, me? Or is it you?
You have aIways taken me wrong.
The other day when I toId you...
what was written in Babu's
Iove-Ietter, you caIIed me insane...
crook and a pervert.
Didn't you?
And when I toId you the truth,
didn't you apoIogise to me?
And when I gave you his Iove-Ietter
that was meant for Shanti,
didn't you...
create a scene? The truth is, you
want attention and admiration.
You even expect someone to profess his
Iove to you. And if someone does...
you create a scene out of it.
That's women's psychoIogy.
TaIk about me. Don't you taIk
about womankind! What do you know...
about women's psychoIogy? Women don't
hide what we have in our hearts.
You men do.
Okay... you do.
Remember, in the restaurant, didn't
you intentionaIIy drop the spoon?
Then didn't you eat
with the spoon I used?
Didn't you hide a feeIing there?
TeII me, what was that?
Remember the car breakdown?
You had faked it, to waIk with me.
Didn't you harass me? You kept on
asking me who do I Iike the most.
That apart, when you introduced aII
your friends to your father...
at one go, couIdn't you have
introduced me on the trot?
Why did you hesitate there?
What feeIings did you hide there?
AII the whiIe you knew it, and you
acted ignorant. Can you expIain?
You gave me an ashtray... fine, I'II
consider that a token of friendship.
But when I gave kisses and said
I Iove you to Geeta on the phone...
weren't you desperate
to know her identity?
You cooIed down onIy when I said
that Geeta is my Mother, didn't you?
You hate to see me smoke. So the gift
can be taken a token of friendship.
But what'd you caII the desperation
that you showed to know about Geeta?
Stop digressing!
Didn't you stare at my waist?
Do you Iove me or not?
- I don't!
Then I didn't stare at your waist!
One can't even taIk to a girI
sitting on a terrace.
Such an egoistic character! I can't
be a friend to such a girI!
Even if we were friends, I wouIdn't
be in Iove. Even if we were in Iove...
I wouIdn't marry you!
Even if I'm forced into it...
I'd run the day before my wedding.
But I'd Ieave a note.
What a girI!
Never met one Iike this!
Look, you have no right
to discuss me and my character!
As for me,
I've never even met you!
From now on,
there's nothing between us!
ParceI from the skies?
- Airdrop. That airhostess is my...
girIfriend. How were the vacations?
- Read through it.
FiIm magazines?
- No, science fiction.
Stop it! Are you human? Bookworm!
You're an insuIt to the fraternity!
No good. What about you?
- What about you?
Went up in smoke.
My story is different.
Her name is Girija. AII of eighteen.
And her eyes... Iike Aishwarya.
Aishwarya Rai?
- Right, moron.
Legs Iike Sen.
- Sushmita Sen?
Not the Suzuki Zen.
Uncrowned beauty!
For her, I designed a FormuIa One,
took it out to the track...
drove out of the pit, programme fixed!
- What programme?
Five in the morning, she enters
the bathroom. Latch turns, I enter.
I see something. It's her back.
I touch. She turns.
Not her. It's her grandmother.
Then...?
- Guess
Trash that beII!
Siva, Babu isn't here?
- No idea.
Jenny, Shanti isn't here?
- No idea.
I'm going to kiII!
- Do it!
Not you. I'II kiII him.
- If you touch Babu you'II kiII me!
Drop dead! As far as I'm concerned,
either way you're dead.
I'd rather you simpIy drop dead.
Aren't you my daughter? How come
you Iost the Iove for money?
I suspect your mother.
- Shame on you!
Look, he's going to die
if you see him again.
Babu came here when you were out of
town. That worsened the matter.
Daddy's men took Babu away.
I know not what happened to him.
Nothing wouId happen to him. It's my
responsibiIity to unite you and Babu.
I haven't come for a compromise.
- Compromise is not a bad idea.
Look, I'm not here to argue
with you. It's important.
Many things have happened here when
we were away during the vacations.
Babu went to Shanti's house to
meet her. And her father caught him.
Shanti stays Iocked in her house.
Did Babu come to coIIege?
No.
The affair that we fostered
is now under danger.
I mean, the affair
between Babu and Shanti.
Did you meet Shanti?
I'm coming from her house.
She was in tears.
I promised to bring
her and Babu together.
I came to you to taIk about it.
You too have promised your friend.
So, to keep our promises,
Iet's together...
Together?
Together, we must unite them.
Are you surprised to hear ''together''?
Let me be expIicit.
For this venture,
we got to define our association.
No Iove, no friendship,
nor any other reIationship.
Just a bIind association.
And that association ends
once they are united.
I hope you wiII abide...
I beIieve, you wiII.
You snatched my words.
ShaII we go and see Babu?
CouIdn't you wait for two months?
Fine, you went there, but...
you shouId've gone to Shanti's room,
why wake up her Dad?
Stop it!
- Never give any commitments.
And Iove is one of it. Take my case,
I'm so happy and contented... why?
Because I'm not in Iove and saved of
hassIes, unIike you. That beard...!
That charade appears fooIish.
I mean, aren't you
worried about Babu?
So? Does worrying and weeping over it
soIve probIems?
Look Babu, don't worry. Get on with
your studies. For Jenny and me...
academics makes no difference. But
you got to study. Forget about Iove.
That's our concern. To unite you
and Shanti is our responsibiIity.
Don't you trust us? Fine, if you
reaIIy Iove her, you wiII get her.
Say what?
- What...?
If the Iove between us is true,
we wiII be united, right?
Yes...
Don't miss cIass tomorrow.
- AII right.
And shave that beard.
No need to waIk.
I shaII drop you.
And that needs no reIationships.
No Iove, no friendship.
Let's think we're strangers. And that
you asked for a Iift and I offered.
if you stiII insist that
you want to waIk... go ahead.
I don't stay in an apartment anymore.
I've shifted to the hosteI...
to distance myseIf
from some affairs.
I see. Then Iet me drop you
at the hosteI.
''O'MoonIight,
are you cross?
''Why did you desert the skies? Why?''
''Love...''
''is thy name siIence?''
''Is it fair to deceive
your own heart?''
standing faraway, you'll try
to touch the sea shore
lf you go near, it'll go far!!
Both of them are restless!!
Our feelings are wavering
like sea waves!!
Not my fauIt this time.
The car broke down on its own.
Let me check.
Snapped wire.
Two minutes.
God! I saw nothing!
It's my habit to say thanks
to a stranger who drops me.
Great habit!
I can understand if you fooI a rustic.
But, didn't my moustache scare you?
I asked you to take me to the
coIIege. And you took me for a ride?
No sir...
- Get Iost! This is no theatre!
Come, Iet me drop you
at the Christian CoIIege.
What for? I've paid him.
Go away, Iet me deaI with him.
Sir! Don't! No one moves without you.
Look at the traffic jam.
Come, I'm going there,
I shaII drop you.
Come on, sir.
How do you survive in this city?
I can see nothing but deception.
But you are good at heart.
Am I right?
AIways smiIing.
I Iove that smiIe.
Do you know my daughter?
- Who...?
SeIvi.
- SeIvi...?
You won't know, for aII the crowd.
Do you know the women's hosteI?
Which one?
- Some Rani...
Rani Mayamma?
- Yes, Rani Mayamma.
I won't forget that hosteI.
My friend stays there.
Not an ordinary girI she is.
She's very egoistic.
What?
- Egoistic.
Meaning?
- It means...
What to say...?
Let me say she is mean.
She never apoIogise even if she knows
that she has committed a mistake.
I see.
- Yes.
She wouIdn't give up.
She is as adamant... how to say?
A stubborn ass?
- Right.
If a girI has that attitude,
can't I? Say what?
Right, right.
Right.
- Yes.
That's the buiIding sir.
- Than you very much.
Do drop by our house if you happen
to come to KuttaIam. Bye.
Daddy!
- How are you, SeIvi?
I'm fine. Where's Mother?
- She wanted to come, I refused.
Why are you Iate?
- Don't ask me. Cabbie messed it up.
Then a boy... wait.
- Where to, Daddy...?
GentIeman! Yes, you.
Come over here.
Why are you standing there.
Come here.
Didn't I teII you someone dropped me,
after I had a fight with the cabbie?
He's the one.
This is my daughter. SeIvi.
- SeIvi?
That's my pet name.
- I see.
Come, Iet's have some coffee.
- No thanks...
It's our custom to give treats
to our guests. No coffee, not fair.
Invite him.
- Come for a cup of coffee.
Let me park my car, sir.
Go on, I'II be back.
Make it fast. Come on.
This is your Iast year. I'm here to
say that I'm considering your wedding
You're aIways at it, Daddy.
I'm not marrying now.
Why not? As you wished, I sent you
to study. Can't you fuIfiII my wish?
PIease sit down.
- I won't.
Why not? Look, she doesn't obey me.
You must obey your father.
- Do you know what he says?
It's between me and my father.
- Behave yourseIf! He's our guest.
I ask her to get married,
and she refuses.
Doesn't that mean
she has someone eIse in her mind?
WeII' I put no conditions. Just that
the guy shouId be decent Iike him.
TeII me if you Iove someone.
I Iove no one!
- Then Iisten to your father.
Find a bridegroom for me, Daddy.
Look at that. She wouIdn't agree.
One word from you, and she agrees!
Our stars match. You soIved the mess
on the road, soIved my probIem too.
My job is over.
Drop me on the way. Bye, dear.
Something very important. He knows
a girI here, who's cross with him.
Forget that, Let's go.
- Wait! For aII your heIp...
wouId it be fair if I ignore you?
- PIease, Iet's go.
HoId on. That girI is a stubborn ass.
A bit out of mind.
She is... you toId me she has
a probIem, ''echo''... isn't it?
Let's go sir.
- Go ahead and say it. Come on.
Ego.
- Yes, ego? She has a massive ego.
Like the stubborn asses
in our viIIage.
For my sake, you taIk to the girI
and teII her that he is a gentIeman.
TeII her that I've said not to fight
with him. PIay the mediator.
Enough, or shouId I stay back and...?
- That's enough, Iet's go.
Bye, dear.
Strange girI! She fights with
a gentIeman! BIame her upbringing.
Everytime you dump ash, it must make
you feeI you're dumping ash it on me.
Are you dancing before me?
Stop!
Here. Look here.
What are you Iooking at?
TeII me, what are you staring at?
Those beautifuI pair of...!
What are you Iooking at with
those beautifuI pair of eyes?
So what if I caught a gIimpse
of that restricted area?
But wasn't that tantaIising?
Fair body covered with a bIack dress!
Part of the Iemony waist Ieft open...
Sorry, not Iemony...
combination of pink and yeIIow.
How couId my eyes resist
such a romantic sight?
You shouId've covered it up.
Not onIy the waist,
I'II see your entire body.
What wiII you do?
You are no match for me!
You have no right to touch it.
I came to discuss something cruciaI.
But we aren't in the right frame.
I boozed because...
- Smoke, booze... do as you wish.
I don't care!
Who are you to me?
Why do I care for person
who doesn't matter to me?
And I don't want to know
why you boozed.
Damn it!
I wiII say it even you
don't want to hear.
I can't get over you, Jenny!
Not you...!
Damn you!
Remember your steps?
- Can't get one right, Master.
You couId pick her up, and not
the step? Forget it, happens.
For this beat...
raise your right Iegs.
Next, for this beat...
Iift both your Iegs.
Won't we faII, Master?
- That wiII reach you to new heights.
How are you?
- Fine.
How couId you guess that was MaIa?
- The stink. Never bathes, you know.
There! I smeII something nice.
Hi! How are you?
- Fine.
Keep it up. But avoid the high heeIs.
Let me come to the point.
This year's cuIturaI programmes are
nearing. RehearsaIs begin tomorrow.
I've caIIed everyone incIuding Siva.
You join Siva. Okay?
No Master. I'm out of it.
- Why?
Just count me out.
- No way! I'm your dance master.
Don't turn me into a Kung Fu Master.
Last year you and Siva were a hit.
This year too, you must combine to...
What is it?
Forget it.
Raghu, Iet Anita pair up with Siva
this year.
Who's Anita?
You ask who is Anita?
She's the new babe in the bIock.
She has the whoIe coIIege rocking.
Guys are going `bIind' for her.
What for?
- It's a tragedy of her Iife.
Her bIind brother was hit by
a speeding truck. Since then...
she has been giving her hand to heIp
every bIind man cross roads.
To get a feeI of her touch, our guys
roam about putting on fake goggIes.
Me too.
What a girI!
What a heart!
Madam, wiII you heIp me cross,
if you don't mind.
Why?
- I'm bIind.
Poor thing!
You've crossed the road, sir!
- Damn the smaII stretch!
Anyway, thanks for the magnanimity!
What's this?
- Shanti's Ietter.
You may give it to Babu.
- Not for him.
For me?
- No.
For you?
- No.
Beats me. Whom is it for...?
- It's for us.
Tough bond.
I mean, the Ietter.
Read.
To Siva and Jenny. From Shanti.
My Iove for Babu is immeasurabIe.
Does it sound typicaI of Iovers?
Never mind, Love is Love, after aII.
And pain comes with it.
PIease, I must see Babu. Shanti.
Now what?
I have an idea. Apart from you
doesn't she have friend, Fatima?
After 4 hours of taxing my brains,
I have the gun ready.
Take care, Babu.
- CarefuI. Don't faII into her Pop...
Iike you did Iast time.
Make sure it is Shanti.
Keep chatting.
I'm off to sIeep.
Who's that, Shanti?
- She's... Fatima's friend. Farida.
Is it her first time here?
- Yes Father.
Fine, you chat with Fatima.
It's Farida's first time here.
I'II show her around.
- Father don't!
No Father!
Stop! Is that Matiz car yours?
Yes.
- Are you Siva?
Yes, I am.
Who are you, man?
- I...
Who are you to her?
- I am her...
Whoever you are,
heIp me with the injection.
Not there, man.
On her hip.
Administer it in her hand, Doctor.
- No, this is meant for the hip.
You don't understand, man!
This shot is meant for the hip.
HeIp me.
- No thanks. You don't know.
The hip has put me in troubIe.
Cock fights have Ied to feuds.
Crashing roofs have cracked nations.
But I never beIieved those taIes.
But when the tiny hip created hassIes
I began to beIieve those taIes.
It'II take me hours to make it cIear.
PIease, Iet her hand take the shot.
Who's the doctor? You or me?
Nurse throw him out.
Thank you. I haven't seen anything.
I won't see anything, either.
Do as you wish.
Hip is a troubIe spot.
It's a wee IittIe spot,
but a weII of agony. Spare me!
Damn the doctors! How can they choose
such a pIace for injections?
''Someone pIease teII me''
''Can someone teII me?''
''FIower buds refuse to bIoom''
''The wind caresses them
tiII they bIoom''
''Is it the defeat of the fIower?
Or is it the victory of the wind?''
''ScuIptures Iie asIeep insides rocks''
''ChiseIs caresses them awake''
''Is it the rocks' defeat?
Or is the triumph of the chiseIs?''
''Someone pIease teII me''
''Can someone teII me?''
''CIouds are knots of rains''
''The wind caresses them
tiII they open''
''Love ties two hearts together''
''When eviI eye is cast,
the ties are undone''
''When two cIouds cIash,
it does not impIy a confIict''
''When two bodies meet,
it does not mean a fight''
''Bodies Iie, hearts never Iie.
Don't you know this truth?''
''Don't seeds of Iove reap
in the siIent soiI?''
''Someone pIease teII me''
''Can someone teII me?''
''When dew drops faII sIowIy,
it springs up newborns''
''When siIence breaks graduaIIy,
Iove is born''
''A hidden heart shows no art,
no Iove''
''A daring heart has no fear,
no burden''
''Does the river drown
shameIess quarreIs?''
''Doesn't the sun open up
the tiIting Lotus bud?''
''Someone answer me''
''Can someone teII me?''
I need to taIk to you. Your staff
refused to give me an appointment.
I'm Siva. You sent men to kiII me.
Surprised to see me aIive?
Did you take the mission to be over?
It wiII take them some more days...
to give you the news of my weII being.
I dispatched them to the hospitaI.
I need just two minutes
of your time.
But he has a bright future.
You may not foresee that, but I do.
I'm here to teII you about the Babu
I know. At my age, my Father...
was in a pathetic state than Babu.
PIease don't mind, but you too.
You were a don. But mind you, at your
age, Babu wiII be far better off...
than me, my father and you.
BeIieve me, sir.
He's good at heart. Apart from money,
he has that quaIity that you don't.
It snatched Shanti away from the Iove
that you bestowed on her for 22 years
Being Babu's wife, she'd be happier
than being your daughter, sir.
Love that is earned without
any hassIes makes one happy.
Unite them, sir.
Two minutes aren't over yet.
I have said what I wanted to.
You may say what you want to, sir.
Get the car!
He didn't say anything?
He said nothing?
- He said the two minutes are over...
and got going.
CouId you figure out
what was in his heart?
What?
- CouId you guess his heart?
That's the hitch. If one couId guess
hearts, he'd never have any probIems.
Meaning?
- Each and every probIem, I mean.
I must Ieave.
You caIIed me?
- Yes.
Why?
We need to taIk.
- I guess, we did just that.
No, we need to discuss
something eIse.
About?
- My foot! Feigns ignorance! Conceit!
You guessed it right.
Beats me. You caIIed me.
Say it.
Bye.
You caIIed me just to say that?
My friend's house is vacant. Coming?
- WouId you mind my shoes?
I don't mind.
- You're incorrigibIe!
I need to taIk to you.
Let me come to the point...
Guys have been chasing me.
But you've got me hooked.
Your eyes! Your nose...
Iips, and...
I can go on and on.
You can faII in Iove with me.
You can dream of making you mine.
That's fine. As for me, the possibiIity
of faIIing in Iove with you...
You have a chance.
- Thanks.
I can decide onIy after
I get to know you for some days.
WouId you mind the deIay?
- No probIem. Take your own time.
Can I touch you?
- With pIeasure. AII yours.
I feeI, I Iike you. You never know
when you get to Iike a person.
Your forehead! Your eyes!
Siva!
- Your nose!
Your Iips!
Your neck!
And...
Don't think that hugging, seducing
has provoked e to scream at you.
At 7:30 we got to see Shanti.
It's seven now. I hope you remember?
Who's this Siva? Friend?
- No chance.
Love?
- Shame! She doesn't fit the biII.
Then who is she?
- Her name is aII I know. Jennifer.
Siva, it's 7:10.
OnIy 20 minutes Ieft.
When do we meet next, Siva?
- Next... next...
Sunday?
- For Iunch?
No, Iet's meet for dinner. Night...
dinner... night wouId be just fine.
So we meet on Sunday night at 10.
Today's Sunday!
So what?
It's about to strike ten.
So what? I don't care!
''HoId me in your arms, sweetheart
Touch me aII over''
''I'm going to tax you
Pay the tax, take me to bed''
''The tax is kiss
Kiss me aII over''
''Let me find the sensitive part
of your body''
''I shaII touch you there''
''I'm the Iamp, and you are my Iight
FueI the fire''
''Let me touch you
Let the emotions fIow''
''Hug me, touch me
Touch me, hoId me''
''Touch me, hug me
Push me through''
''The greatest gift
is the Iover's heart''
''Every vein in my body oozes
out a fountain of passion''
''You are an institution of Iove''
''Naughty boy''
''Like the rising sun, kiss me,
push me through''
''My heart is throbbing,
touch me, appease me''
''The hair on your body!
Let me Iose myseIf in them''
''Honey, your ears,
Iet me bite them''
''Never scaIe the HimaIayas
without Oxygen''
''Take to bed,
not without imaginations''
''The bed wiII have vanished
by daybreak. Watch''
''HoId me in your arms, honey
Touch me aII over''
''I'm going to tax you
Pay the tax, take me to bed''
''The tax is kiss
Kiss me aII over''
''Let me find the sensitive part
of your body''
''I shaII touch you there''
No, Anita don't.
Anita, don't!
I asked you out for Iunch,
but you said dinner.
Then why do you make me pine
for my dinner?
Siva, stop!
Stop biting!
Let me answer the phone, Anita!
You are mine, Siva!
Sorry for the deIay.
- That's okay. What did Shanti say?
She asked to forget.
Forget what?
- The affair.
Whose affair?
Shanti and Babu's affair.
Shanti caIIs it off.
And what did you teII her?
- What have I to say if she refuses?
And why wouId you care? It's in you
to Iove someone and then dump him.
You don't care what it does him.
- You taIk as if you are a gentIeman!
Don't I know you?
Weren't you wheezing?
Weren't you wheezing and whining
away Iast night?
I wheezed the night before too. I do
it everyday. And I wiII, tomorrow.
I'II do it as hard as I can. Now
this is getting to be too much.
What's wrong in breathing? I agree,
staring at your waist was wrong.
How can you say breathing is wrong?
Not onIy me, everybody does it.
Your parents breathe, my parents too.
Can you and I Iive without it?
Even this dog breathes, hard
and deep. Say what, puppy?
There! Deep breathing is good for
heaIth. How can you say it is wrong?
I'm taIking about the other type.
- No cIassifications! If breathing...
is bad, everything you do is bad.
- If that's how you taIk, I'm going.
For aII the pain they've endured
in Iove, Shanti refuses? Is it fair?
It's time for aII of us to part.
So Iet me see you off.
Come MahaIaxmi. That's not
how you do it. Bye sweetheart!
Come Nandu. How's your sister?
She was very cIose to me.
Goodness! Jackie Chan's sister?
See you Iater.
Shake hands!
Get Iost!
Shake hands and vanish!
Come my princess, my darIing! Bye.
Get Iost!
Are you going away too, Anita?
- Yes.
Now there'd be no dearth of broken
hearts around. You aIways say...
you Iove kids, right?
- Yes. I just Iove kids!
ShaII I heIp you out?
Shanti's wedding
has been fixed on Friday.
Now what?
Here. Over here.
Your daughter... take it easy...
she isn't here.
Don't disappoint the guests. Let them
offer bIessings. It'II reach her.
Right now she's getting married
as per the day and time you fixed.
One more important thing. KiIIing
by mock accidents is your forte.
Dare not use it on me. Pray that
nothing happens to me.
In case anything happens to me, you
wiII be heId. I've set everything up.
Looks Iike you're worked up,
are you? Intend to knock me down?
Look, Iet aIone me, you
can't even touch my image.
Want to give it a shot?
Go ahead. Go on.
My car. Honeymoon a month in Ooty.
Then head straight to CaIcutta.
My Dad has fixed a job for you.
Wish you a happy married Iife.
As a paI, you've been of much heIp.
I'm no friend if I don't heIp you.
You and Jenny aren't
getting aIong weII, right?
Hidden and unspoken feeIings are the
cause of miseries. When expressed...
probIems are soIved. That's the way
it is. You may Iike someone, yet...
you pretend not to, and vice versa.
But why? The heart is so tiny.
It's no use suppressing, twisting and
hurting the feeIings in your heart.
If you Iike someone, say yes. If you
don't, say no. Isn't it fair?
God has given eyes to see, ears
to hear. Know why He gave a heart?
To Iove. Love each other.
Don't Iet your egos overcome you.
That's aII I have to say. Bye.
- Bye Jenny.
You've heIped me a Iot in uniting
my friend with his Iove.
I must aIso thank you for
heIping my friend win her Iove.
You've been of much heIp.
I must thank you.
Priya here, Jenny.
We're parting and you don't
sound sorry?
I'm aIready tensed.
Sir, the cab is here.
ShaII I keep the Iuggage?
Siva?
- Gone.
Gone? Where to?
- To the station.
Which train?
- The Howrah MaiI at seven.
Jenny...?
- She's gone.
Where?
- Egmore. By NeIIai Express at seven.
Hang on.
Nobody here.
Someone caIIed Jennifer...?
- No one.
CouId he have gone
searching Iook for me?
CouId she have gone
Iooking for me?
If not?
Has she?
If not?
What's in my heart...
I'II write it down.
Many a days, I wanted to teII you
something. Know what it is?
I Iove you, Siva.
I tried to say whiIe you were around,
but wonder why it remained unsaid!
Today, when I feeI Iike teIIing you,
I don't find you around.
If Ieft unsaid today, I fear it wiII
never be said, Jenny. I'm afraid!
When Iife deserts you, onIy then
you reaIise the true vaIue of Iife.
And that's how I feeI at the time of
our parting. I'II miss you, Jenny.
Do you know when I feIt the Iove
inside me rise for you?
When I drew my hands away from yours
after thanking you...
when I saw your picture
I had trashed.
It's not in me to
break someone's heart.
I Iove you. How couId I ever
think of hurting you?
Every night Iying in bed,
a thousand times I must've said...
''I'm sorry Jenny.
I Iove you''.
But I never said it to you. Had I,
our probIems wouId've been soIved.
I kept fighting with you
throughout the year...
but I couIdn't Iive without you
even for a minute, Siva.
After a Iong time,
I have faced a truth.
It wasn't a fight,
it was an expression of Iove.
Didn't you say that if the Iove
between us is true it wiII unite us?
My Iove for you is true, Siva.
I need you, Jenny.
To fight with me, to Iove me.
Yours...
- Siva.
Excuse me. One Siva wiII be here.
PIease give this to him.
Madam...
Madam!
What's the time?
What time is it?
Time, Madam?
Sorry. BIoody deaf!
WeIcome, Madam SeIvi. First Iet me
give you a good news. You're Iucky...
to have got such a father.
Since the day you agreed to marry...
he has been up day and night
and has found a bridegroom for you.
He wished to marry you off on the day
of your arrivaI. And so it wouId be.
You've just got to get there
and marry. Come, be quick.
Hey, how are you? The arrangements...
- I have toId her aIready, sir.
Wasn't that my job, you fooI?
Go and dress up.
- Father...
I know. You want to know if
the bridegroom wouId run away?
No way. I've aIready asked him
beforehand. He has no girIfriends.
Nothing to worry. Go, ready yourseIf.
