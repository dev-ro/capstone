Madeleine, can we buy
some milk from you?
One quart.
Take it off the top
so there's lots of cream.
Thanks.
The same, but with more cream.
Thanks.
It's a shame. Such a nice girl.
Imagine not being able to talk.
Completely mute.
No wonder, after what happened.
Such a sweet, young girl.
It must be 15 years ago by now.
And the old man who raped her
got off scot-free.
They said he was insane.
Not responsible for his actions.
But it sure is strange
the girl can't talk.
The doctor said
it was because of the trauma.
Some kind of mental block.
Madeleine.
You better hurry if you want
to catch the 4:00 bus.
You haven't had any time off
for a month.
Can you give me a single reason
not to come to town with me?
Hi, my name is Tony.
Got this car today.
Isn't she a beauty?
A 3000 GTO.
157 horses.
Goes from zero to 100
in 81/2 seconds.
Max speed just over 200.
You buy the hottest car in town,
but still the best is missing.
A chick to drive around with.
Would you like something to eat?
It's on the company.
We'll start with cheese and herring...
followed by the pepper steak flambé.
Figs in cognac flambé.
Red wine,
and Akvavit with the herring...
and some champagne to start.
I like women
who don't talk too much...
but you set a new record.
Welcome.
May I take your coat?
Thanks.
Won't you sit down?
I'll get something to drink.
Cheers.
You aren't drinking.
It won't kill you.
Just good stuff.
Cheers.
Hello, nurse?
It's Tony. Is the doctor in?
Thanks, that's kind of you.
Hi, it's Tony.
A new prospect. 110 pounds.
A real beginner.
How much will we need?
Can you bring the shots immediately?
She's sound asleep now.
Sure, great. See you.
Hi, it's Tony.
In ten days
I'll have a fine new chick ready.
How about that?
The fifth this year.
Soon we can close up
and retire to Switzerland.
That's great. So long.
Good to see you, Sam.
Here's our patient.
She needs a little stimulation.
Just sign your name.
Sign the duplicate too.
No need to read it.
Just sign it.
Where the hell are you going?
There you are... my love.
Now, here's the situation.
You have become hooked on heroin...
which isn't like
your ordinary amphetamines.
It's the toughest narcotic
in existence.
You're hooked both physically
and psychologically...
and you'll die in 48 hours
if you don't get a fix.
But we're not going to have
any trouble, are we?
Do as I say and you'll get
your two shots a day.
"I never want...
to see you again.
Because you never understood.
You never understood
how much I hated that terrib/e farm.
How your protective instincts
suffocated me.
I have found a wonderful man
who has given my life meaning.
I'm doing everything to forget
my horrible time with you.
I hope you'll forget
about me quickly.
You'll never see me again...
because I never want
to see you again.
Signed, Madeleine."
Well, my little friend,
now life really begins.
You'll get two of these a day
if you do as I say.
Your first visitor arrives at 1:00.
No mistakes, or you'll go without.
Now, let's have a look at your room.
The accountant is arriving soon.
Be nice to him.
Hi, sweetheart.
Take off your clothes.
Tony! What the hell?
Goddamn it!
What kind of bitches
do you have here?
How can I go home to my wife
with my face looking like this?
Damn it!
I'm gonna scar her for life.
I'm doing great. How about you?
What? The pirate?
Let me check. Tuesday?
The pirate is available
between 2:00 and 4:00.
But the price has gone up.
Yeah, she's more than Sally.
Is that okay? Great.
My pleasure. Thank you.
This is how it is from now on.
You're on your own.
Every morning at 9:00,
you'll get a list from me
with names of customers
and times they'll arrive.
You'll get two packets
so you can make it through the day.
Monday's your day off.
On Sunday you'll get four packets
so you can make it through Tuesday.
If you behave, you'll get
a percentage of the profits.
That's fair, isn't it?
Here's today's list. In half an hour
you start with Mr. Andersson.
What?
That's right. I almost forgot.
Get undressed.
My name's Sally.
You poor thing.
The beginning's the worst.
You feel so sick you wanna die.
The only thing that keeps you going
is the dependency on dope.
If you go without for too long,
then you really start feeling things.
Goddamn!
I tried to leave here once.
I ran back to my little town.
To Mom.
But I fell apart.
I thought I'd die.
Tony sent two thugs to get me.
Horrible bastards.
They'll do anything
for a couple of grand.
After those guys,
being back here seemed all right.
At the most you'll last 30-36 hours
without getting a new hit.
After that, it's over.
You get paranoid.
Then you die,
unless you get another hit.
But I've got a plan of my own
to fall back on.
I hit up all the johns
for additional loot.
For a bit of extra service.
In a year I'll have enough
to take off for Switzerland.
There's a rehab clinic there
for drug addicts.
It takes four months
before you're cured.
But it takes dough.
Around 60,000
for the entire treatment.
I should be able to leave
in about a year.
I get this way sometimes.
I can't help it.
Hey, I saw Tony
had a letter for you.
I took it when he wasn't looking.
"What a terrib/e /etter
we received today.
How can our /itt/e Made/eine...
be so fu// ofhate?"
What did we do wrong?
What we did wrong
you could have set right.
Now we have nothing to live for.
We are tormented by the fact
that our little Madeleine...
is so full of hate.
After all these terrible
disappointments...
your father and I
only want to tell you...
not to worry.
You will never see us again.
Madeleine...
you were our everything.
The sunshine of our lives.
Good-bye.
The doctor said it was poison...
but I wonder where it came from.
It seems awfully strange
they were the only ones poisoned.
A lot of people bought milk that day.
Well, I wonder.
You don't pour poison
in your milk by mistake.
I still wonder if it wasn't...
Sure, after those terrible letters
the girl wrote her parents.
Terrible letters.
I read the last one.
They took it really hard.
So, you want to learn how to drive
faster than the average guy.
Half of this will do.
This is a model 96 rifle,
also called a Mauser.
It was used in both world wars.
If you lie down...
a little further back. There.
Hold it against your shoulder,
because it has a good kick.
Hold it steady.
To load, lower the weapon.
Pull the bolt up, then back,
and then insert the cartridge.
Push down
and move the bolt forward.
Then bring the gun up
against your shoulder.
Make sure you keep it
steady against your shoulder.
Place your finger on the trigger
and gently squeeze off a shot.
Reload.
Check your shoulder.
Now aim and squeeze.
You'll have a visitor today
who's never been here before.
Take good care of...
This is Tony.
Oh, hi there.
Good, as usual.
Sorry, what did you say?
The 24th? Let's have a look.
She's just great, as usual.
Step back.
You're striking too quickly.
Sink down and strike hard.
That's better. Step back.
Now look.
If you're coming
into a curve like this...
and you start to skid...
you have to steer into the skid.
Steer into it like this
until you come out of it here.
Then you floor it.
Wait here.
I have a present for you.
An extra hit.
By the way, Sally's gone.
She won't be back.
Got another job in Beirut.
That's her business.
Hope it works out well for her.
I can't teach you anymore.
I'll be damned! All bull's-eyes.
Hell, you want that much?
You want a powerful one?
I need two more bills.
You got a car too.
Three beers.
We've got trouble.
Madeleine shot a customer.
She may be after you too.
I got you two tickets to Spain.
Get lost until things cool off.
Yeah, it's me.
Come over right away.
I have a rush job for you.
What?
Right, 10,000 a head.
Hurry up, damn it!
Great. Bye.
Hello?
What? Axelsson?
You're scared?
Think how I feel!
Hell, no! She's gone nuts.
Completely mad.
No, of course I've closed the shop.
She has to return soon to get a fix.
Take my advice and go out
to the country until this is over.
What? No problem.
Someone's just come in. Bye.
I'm glad you got here so fast.
Madeleine shot two of her customers.
Set a trap for her
and then take her for a drive.
She is not to be found again.
I'm out. There's nothing left.
I'm completely cleaned out.
I know somebody.
The hot dog man in the harbor.
Go there.
Car 411.
This is 411, over.
We have shots fired in the harbor.
Warehouse three. Over.
411, I read you.
Over and out.
Drop your weapon.
She's totally nuts.
She's challenged me to a duel.
I get to choose the weapons.
She should be in a nuthouse.
Now she's gonna get
what's coming to her.
I'll get her once and for all.
Madeleine,
what the hell are you doing?
Put down the gun,
and let's talk about this.
It's just a misunderstanding.
What kind of nonsense is this?
Put down the rifle.
Madeleine, please.
You fucking whore!
Thought you could fool me, huh?
Damn slut!
Which knee should I blow away first?
Fucking whore!
