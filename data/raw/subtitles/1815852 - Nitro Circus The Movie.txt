Nitro Circus started
very organically...
with a group of friends.
[ Squealing ]
[ Man #2 ]
It's their childhood dream
just manifesting itself...
in the present moment.
[ Man #3 ] People are so
conditioned in watching movies
that they all think it's fake.
There's real life on the line
in what Nitro does.
[ Children Screaming ]
[ Chanting ]
Nitro! Nitro! Nitro!
[ Man #4 ]
To get to a live tour
and actually pull it off-
lt is insanity.
lt was not possible.
[ Engine Roaring ]
[ Man #5 ]
These guys will never make it.
[ Man #6 ]
Nitro is about trying to find
where it's not possible to go.
And then going there.

[ Man Narrating ]
Childhood never ended for
this lively band of brothers.
They've always had one mission-
to have more fun
than anyone on the planet.
Oh! Oh!
Go!
[ Narrator ]
The crew is led by
two good old boys...
who met when they
were 12 years old-
Jeremy Rawle,
a hippie lawyer who gave up
his failing law practice...
to fight off the symptoms
of midlife crisis.
[ Screams ]
Am I done, or do I
need to do that again?
You're done.
And Godfrey,
the son of a trucker
and the poster child for adult
attention-deficit disorder.
Under Gregg and Jeremy's
unorthodox direction-
[ Groans ]
the crew recorded
their adventures
in a series of short movies...
and even a TV show.
Through some creative financing,
they made this movie,
shot in 3-D,
which cost a buttload.
They pitched their idea
to Hollywood,
but Hollywood
crapped its pants.
The studio executives
were terrified...
that this movie
was too dangerous.
Pussies.
The end goal
for the Nitro Circus-
the dream they've shared
since childhood-
was to perform their stunts
live in front of an audience.
They set their sights on a show
at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
But would anyone
really come to see them?
I mean, who are
these guys anyway?
[ Laughing ]
I'll tell you who.
First off,
there's Travis Pastrana,
the modern-day Evel Knievel,
1 8-time X Games medalist...
and five-time
national champion.
But he can't throw a ball
to save his own life.
He's the all-American
wonder kid...
and ringleader
of the Nitro Circus.
[ Vocalist ]
Yeah!
♪ I wanna party ♪
Then there's
a 26-year-old man-child-
Yeah! Not in my house, punk!
Not today!
[ Ferocious Shout ]
Streetbike Tommy.
He is the most adorable member
of the Nitro Circus...
and the fattest.
He loves cheeseburgers,
soda pop...
and hates
his everyday occupation
of hanging drywall.
But the Nitro Circus is more
than just fat, hairy men.
[ Groans ]
[ Bleeps ]
♪ I don't care
what you think about me ♪
Jolene Van Vugt-
She is tough, sexy
and downright full of it.
She is the only one
with a vagina.
She keeps the boys in line
by not just competing
with them,
but showing them up.
Nitro Girl is the real deal.
Not quite as sexy,
but just as ballsy...
is Erik Roner,
extreme skier and BASE jumper.
He has no business
on anything with a motor.
[ Shouts ]
Although he's completely
out of his element
with this group,
he's always game
to hurl his body
into harm's way.
For a dude with a tramp stamp,
he's one bad mofo.
Come on, Special!
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
Hit him, Special!
Come on, come on.
Work it lower to high.
Come on.
Which brings us
to Special Greg,
Travis's cousin.
He's a jack-of-all-trades
and master of none.
Like a cat, he always seems
to land on his feet.
And like a nasty honey badger,
nothing can stop him.
Special-
[ Body Thuds ]
Well, all right now.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
[ Bell Rings ]
At least one member
of the crew...
has a steady job, for now.
[ Horn Honking ]
Jim DeChamp.
He's Travis's oldest friend.
Oh!
He has a super-long neck...
and is somehow always able
to always cheat death.
He's the current
world record holder...
for consecutive
one-handed claps.

[ Narrator ]
These guys don't give a rip...
about what most people
think is possible.
They only care about
pushing each other
beyond their comfort level,
givin' it hell...
and seeing if they can come out
all right on the other end.
They've been doing this
since childhood.
This is the Nitro Circus.
So we might as well
pack seven people
into a school bus...
and see how far
that puppy can fly.

[ Man ]

[ Whooping ]
[ Whooping, Cheering ]
My, uh, 12th-grade teacher
was right,
and I was meant to be
a bus driver.
Hands down, one of
the coolest things I've ever
gotten to do in my life.
Absolutely.
[ Narrator ]
Their biggest goal is
to share what they do live...
in front of a packed house
at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
We came from Mexico
to see the show.
We are really,
really excited.
I've definitely never seen
anything like it before.
Those guys are crazy
with talent.
This is the best day of my life.
Rock and roll.
I think the reason people
connect to Nitro Circus-
It's- I think everyone
has a relationship with fear.
I think you can sort of
hearken back to that moment...
where you did something
very stupid...
and somehow, like, just skinned
under the wire of death.
It's almost like that idea
of, like,
if you had the balls
or were willing to do it,
it would be so much fun
to get with all your friends...
and go do sketchy things...
that give you
this amazing adrenaline rush.
It's crazy.
Half the- [ Bleeps ]-
these guys do,
they have to go
out of the States
because it's illegal...
to jump off buildings
the way they're doing it.
It's illegal to do
the stuff they want to do
in America.
That- [ Bleeps ]- illegal, guys.
That should be your-
That's what it should be like.
Ah, this might not be
a good idea.
Travis is like,
"No, let's get on a plane."
Wow.
This is one
of those stunts that-
This is why
we do what we do.
[ Jolene ]
We just got up to the top
of this skyscraper-
63 stories high
above Panama City.
It's going to be
a very interesting BASE jump.
First of its kind ever.
And we're not too sure
exactly how it's gonna go.
When you jump off that,
that ground comes at you
real fast.
I'll tell you that much.
You got about four seconds
to figure it out.
You're good.
What can possibly
go wrong?
Well, for some reason,
me and Crum...
are the only ones
down here on the ground.
We, uh-
I think we're Team "C."
Yeah. 'Cause we wanna see
what's gonna happen down here.
- 'Cause we wanna see
what's gonna happen.
- [ Laughing ]
[ Bonifay ]
So we got Roner
perched on a blob,
and there's two fat
Elvis Evel Knievels
jumping onto it,
and he's gonna shoot off
the blob on top of the building.
You know what happens,
is I get so nervous...
that I have to pee.
For them.
Yeah, I need to pee.
Like, why do I have to pee?
I'm not even doing anything.
You shouldn't pee, man.
I think I'm gonna pee.
Hey, Jer.
You ready for this, baby?
It's go time.
[ Crum ]
Almost 500 pounds up there,
I think. Maybe more.
Of man meat.
- How is it out there, Erik?
- lt sucks!
[ Laughing ]
We've been waiting
our whole lives for this.
We're damn good too, man.
[ Man ]
You got it, Rubs.
You got it!
Three, two,
one!
I love you!
[ Man #1 ] Oh, no. No.
[ Man #2 ] Perfect!
Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!
[ Whoops ]
Yeah!
[ Whooping ]
- Yeah!
- [ Excited Chattering ]
Whoo!
Oh, my God.
I thought he was gonna go way
further away from the blob than that.
That was not far enough.
I about- [ Bleeps ]-
my pants when you
turned in towards the building.
That was heavy.
I didn't go very far out.
I think I saw someone having tea
in their apartment building
real close.
Hi. Whoo.
[ Crum ] I think Roner
deserves a group hug...
that he's still with us.
Get in there,
breathe it in.
Rubberneck,
you sick puppy.
Can we be done with,
uh, skyscraper blob drop?
Look at you.
Did you see
what just happened?
[ Crashing ]
Ow!
Tommy ejected,
missed all the safety boxes...
and slammed
into the ground.
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
My- [ Bleeps ]- ass.
If Tommy had bounced the
other way, he would have blobbed
himself right off the building,
and that would have been
the end of Tommy.
Tommy, I got
a couple cheeseburgers
coming your way.
Thank you for launching me
over that building safely.
Outside of Streetbike Tommy,
you guys are
far superior athletes.
Uh, we're more theatrical
with our costumes...
and man-on-man contact.
You guys have more things
with motors in them,
and we do more pranks.
I came from Jackass
and when I met the Nitro family,
it felt very familiar to me.
I get the dynamics of it
right away.
It's like all the same
inbred family.
[ Tremaine ] Really,
it just always boiled down to-
The difference
between Jackass
and Nitro...
was our Jackass stunts
are always designed to fail.
Everyone accepts that.
Nitro's stunts-
you have to succeed,
or you die.
Same mother,
different daddies.
[ Chuckling ]
In this game
of Freedom Flyers,
the objective is
for me to leave
my mother's nest...
and fly...
with the help of
a bungee cord...
and a jelly doughnut
inner tube.
Hit that there jump,
launch in and take out
as many of my friends...
and as much of their home
as possible.
In other words,
I'm a wrecking ball...
in the form of a bird.
So, Rubs, this is
your speed test for this.
We need to line up
how you're gonna jump...
and to see how fast
you need to go,
so you're our guinea dive.
The water's
three foot deep.
You're gonna be
20 feet in the air,
goin' 120 feet in distance.
No problem.
Okay. Let's get you
on that tube.
[ Jolene ]
Go, Rubs!
[ Whooping ]
[ Laughing ]
Whoo!
Was that far enough?
They told me it was time
for me to leave
the mother's nest.
I'm ready to go right back
into that nest.
I think that was the biggest
D.D.T. body slam I've ever had.
Oh. I don't know
about this one.
There's just so much that
could possibly go great here.
Great possibilities.
There's a lot
of scenarios.
The goal was Tommy.
Now the goal is
to take out Parks.
Parks is the only one
left on top.
Um, I still think Tommy
should be hit.
All right.
I'm ready to freedom fly.
Go get 'em, Roner.
[ Man ]
Good luck, buddy!
[ Man ]
Whoa! Holy-
[ Bleeps ]
Oh, my God!
Yeah!
[ Distorted Shout ]
Parks, you hit the water
so fast!
That was like- boom!
You don't stop!
That was one
of the hardest hits
I've ever had.
The thing about freedom
is you can never stop
fightin' for it,
so we're gonna try again.
Freedom!
Take off.
Freedom!
Oh!
[ Shouts ]
[ People Laughing ]
Oh- [ Bleeps ]
That was a lot
of destruction.
That was awesome.
[ Travis ]
Wow. Special got
knocked the "F" out.
[ Jim ]
Special took it-
[ Travis ]
Wow! What a hit.
[ Erik ]
Freedom Flyers has been pretty
damn rough until this point.
But, unfortunately,
we didn't accomplish what
I was trying to accomplish,
which was take out my friends
and their home.
I think we gotta
do it again,
which sucks for me.
But, um, I'm gonna try to
have a positive attitude...
and, uh, try to catch
some more air.
Red rover, red rover,
send Roner on over!
You can take our land,
but you can't take
our freedom!
[ Shouting ]
Yeah!
Good luck, buddy.
Perfect.
Back up.
Oh!
Oh- [ Bleeps ]
Oh. That's gonna
leave a mark.
We gotta carry him off.
You got blood on there.
Holy- [ Bleeps ]
That's probably where
your teeth are bleeding from.
ls that Roner's blood?
Wow.
[ Jolene ]
As soon as I saw you
take off, I was, like,
"Oh, he's heading
straight for Tommy."
[ Erik ]
For a minute, I was,
"Oh, I got the stars."
Then I was like, "Oh, Tommy."
When I saw you, I was like,
"Yes, I finally got one!"
[ Laughing ]
For all you people
that wanna be on Nitro Circus...
and come out
and do this stuff,
ooh, it's so much fun.
Perfect!
As we found out,
freedom ain't free of pain.
Ka-kah!
[ All ]
Ka-kah!
[ Man ] To fill
an arena in Las Vegas
is no easy task.
Everyone tells 'em
they can't do it.
A loss in what they do
is different than losing a game.
You miss a field goal,
you miss a field goal.
You miss doing
a double backflip, you die.
And they approach
every obstacle like that.
Those are paying fans
looking to be entertained.
You just can't lose.
[ Shutter Clicking ]
[ Man ] Travis's compound
that he has in Maryland...
is, uh, a true testament
that he lives this life.
It's in such
a beautiful setting,
you know,
with these lush trees
all around,
and it's just- yeah,
the devil's playground, man.
Death is everywhere.
You can smell it in the air.
[ Sheckler ]
The only thing that is
burnt in my brain...
from that dude's house...
is the first time I went there,
we're going into the foam pit,
this random dude
just comes around,
and he's like,
"Travis, can I flip?"
Travis said, "Yeah, flip.
Just don't go right."
That's when the dude
took the 1 1 0 off the side.
Like smoked himself.
And I saw that
with my own eyes.
I was like,
"Dude, don't go right."
Burnt into my brain.
It's a little factory
of bad ideas.
Well, Trav,
after all these years
of talking about it,
you finally built this loop
in your backyard.
Every single thing that we do,
someone in our crew steps up,
and Jolene has volunteered
to step up for us.
Thank you, Jolene.
You came right out
this morning and said you
wanted to hit this first.
I'm comin' in hot.
Everyone's gotta go first once,
and l- just go.
We don't even know if
this is gonna work, Jo.
I don't care.
All right.
Let's get up there
and do this.
This is a way better loop.
[ Laughing ]
You're on your third loop!
Hey, guys, Tommy's
on his third loop!
I'm looking for
a baker's dozen.
Mmm.
[ Travis ] Loops are stupid.
I don't know why we built one.
I guess just to see
all these people that scared
that are such badasses.
And Jolene gears up first.
Crazy girl. Crazy.
I have nothing
but wonderful things
to say about Jolene...
because I'm
scared to death of her.
Being the only girl
in that whole crew,
it must be very difficult.
And she pulls it off
like a champ.
For someone
who doesn't have balls,
she has the biggest set.
lt looks fun though, Jo.
You're in the hot seat,
not me, but it does
look fun.
[ Jolene ]
My main concern is aiming.
I do have a word of advice.
Do you wanna hear it?
I don't- I think
I want to vomit,
so I think
I want to go.
Okay.
We're ready to go.
But aim for the black line.
That's my word of advice.
Just get in there
and hit that thing!
Yeah.
What's taking so long?
Okay.
Just stop talking!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah, JoJo!
Okay.
This is gonna be cool.
You got it.
[ Cheering ]
[ Laughing ]
That was awesome!
That was awesome!
That was the best!
That was rad! Good job.
She's pumped!
Look at that.
I own you, Mr. Loop!
You're saying
don't lean too far forward
'cause you'll die?
I mean, I don't know.
I did a tricycle.
You're doing a wheelchair.
Big difference.
Oh, man.
I need some-
some wheelchair advice.
Yes.
And unfortunately,
you're the only one
of your kind,
so, sorry, you don't
get any advice.
So I gotta talk to myself.
You're a unicorn.
You're the only one
of your kind.
The only difference
between a unicorn and you
is that you've been spotted.
[ Laughs ]
[ Narrator ]
Aaron Fotheringham,
a.k.a. Wheelz.
He was born with spina bifida
and can't walk.
If you ask him,
he's not in a wheelchair.
He's just riding one.
- [ Men ] Whoo!
- Makes the rest of the crew
feel like pussies.
[ Travis ] It's my house,
and I am scared to death
to go around this loop,
and Wheelz is gonna try it
on a wheelchair.
And I am scared for him.
Good luck, Wheelz!
You own this one, dude.
Come on, buddy.
It's good.
You got it- Pickin' up speed.
Not too fast.
You got it,
you got it, you got it.
Oh!

- Oh, my God.
- You are the toughest kid.
You are so tough.

Oh, my God.

Seriously, the first time I've ever
seen things that are floating.
[ Jolene ]
Oh, my God. Aaron, your head-
[ Man ]
How are you
conscious right now?
[ Distorted Voices ]
[ Man ]
Dude, you hit so hard, I thought
you were gonna start walkin'.
Yeah, Wheelz!
[ Cheering ]
Wheelz, are you ready
to leave this loop
behind you?
I sure am.
This thing broke my heart.
What are you doing
with that?
Oh, no, no. Wheelz!

settin' that thing on fire!

This is the tallest,
steepest BMX ramp that we have.
- Jim, you wanna calculate
this ramp for us?
- I'll do my math calculations.
I'm going no pedals,
no brakes and just goin'
whatever the hell big the hill is.

that's about right.

of his comfort zone.
He kind of gets guilted
into like, "Yo, I can do it.
I wanna be-
I can do it too.
I can do it too."
Then some catastrophic thing.
Um, if you hit
absolutely perfect,
you have a two percent chance.

- But he's going really fast.
- Too fast. Too fast.

I even thought I was goin'-

is way off.
I always think
I can go faster.
He's a real wild card,
and he gives great footage.
We're getting ready
to jump a Big Wheel
at way too fast of a speed.
Holy- [ Bleeps ]
[ Man Laughing ]
What's a Big Wheel?
Okay, it's a kids' toy.
They must be
the best-put-together
Big Wheels ever.
Like, these guys
are jumping them
at least a hundred feet...
on some of their craziest ones
and landing, no problem.
Like, it doesn't
make sense.
I think the only way
that I would be able
to get the feeling...
is if I had to try
to ride the trike,
which I don't wanna do, Travis,
so- [ Bleeps ]- off.
All right, guys.
Over the past three years,
the most elusive trick
that we have not
been able to do...
is the double backflip
on trikes.
This has turned
into a mission.
We have a launch ramp.
We have Mount Mulch-more.
And today is the day...
that we beat this trick!
All right. Hands in.
Nitro on three.
One, two, three!

I'm the guinea pig.
I got the short straw.
You know how that works.
Got a long day ahead of us!

from what Special did,

for the best.

You landed on your face,
and you got a calf cramp?

This has been
an absolute bear of a trick.

all to Maryland

we all came to Maryland.
This was the trick,
the stunt, the fun day
that we all wanted to have,
and you conquered it, man.
Hose me down
and dress me up.
Let's go out tonight.
Whoo!
Get so excited about
being the world's first double
on a Big Wheel...
when it's just you
and your friends
that do it.
No one else.
No one else in the world.
You're claiming,
"Oh, this is the greatest day
of our lives"...
because it's like four of you
have ever even tried to do it.
And you're the only ones
with these highly modified,
next-level Big Wheels. Okay?
So it's yours to own forever
because no one's ever
gonna do it.
All right, Hubert.
Somebody's gotta
stick that landing!
We built all that mulch.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinkin' me,

that means someone
probably got hurt.
[ Man ] Always told my boys
you gotta go like hell.
Gregg never went easy.
He always had to push
the envelope.
If Scott jumped a hundred feet,
he had to jump 1 1 0.
Maybe from that,
they got more and more
and more competitive.
So here's the deal-
I am the present
world record holder...
of the longest
and highest semi jump
in the world.
[ Horn Honking ]

This is Nitro Circus.
I've seen you land on your head

This has gotta work out
a lot better then.
It's a win-win for you.

You've tried this out?

you've got it all modified?
Well, kinda. I tell you,
if he hits it hard,
you're going for a ride.
I'm just telling you guys,
you're goin' for a ride if he
cranks on that throttle, so-
Well, the guys said they
wanted a little horsepower
to pull the rope,
so we brought in
our friend The Colonel
to give us a little help.
You think this is really
what they asked for?
No.

picked up that takeoff,
smacked his face dead on his-

And then he, like- it was-
[ Laughing ]
He was still holding on.
And violently flung himself
lifelessly-

lt didn't look real.
There wasn't enough lube.
lt was all dried out.
I got serious burn marks
down my whole entire chest.
[ Laughing ]
No, it was peeling off me,
and I was, like,
"I'm not lettin' go."
I would suggest
wearing protection.
lt started burning.
I was like, "Oh, it's
pulling my skin off.
I can't let go.
It's pulling my skin off.
[ Bleeps ] I gotta hang on."
Boom! I'm like,
"Oh, I'm gonna flip and land."
Then, "I'm still in the air."
I'm so proud of you.
I... just wanted to show you
what glory looks like.
Good job.
Dude, your stomach
is horrible.
lt hurts, dude.
Does anybody have
any aloe vera?
With my experience
and your smart mouth,
we're the best team

I did one, and I was like,
"All right, enough air
to do two."
Do two.
So I go into two
and I come out of two.
And I'm still like
25, 30 feet high up there.
You did like a half
at that point.
Then I was like,
"Do I go three

I think I tried to dive.

Hi. I'm Wheelz,
and I'm jumping
this big-ass ramp
on my wheelchair.
Trying to harness the Nitro cast
before a show or stunt...
is pretty much like trying
to herd a thousand...
clinically insane
stray cats.
Except they all have
skateboards and motorcycles,
and they're all faster than me.
Five minutes!
Five minutes!
Go out there
in five minutes!
No, I got fans.
Streetbike Tommy.
Best- Best of
the Nitro crew.
[ Laughing ]
We've had to leave the country
on many occasions...
to get the kind of footage
that's gonna make people flock
to see this movie.
You know
that there was no strings.
There was no special effects.
There was no green screen.
There was no nothing
to say...
that they didn't
actually do it.
And that's what
you guys are doing.
You're just actually
doing it and saying,
"All right. Watch."
[ Erik ]
We just arrived
in Panama City,
and we're gonna
start the day off...
with Jim trying
to hydro-skim across
the Nitro City pool.
In true Nitro fashion,
it's gonna be either
really amazing...
of Jim's gonna eat-
[ Bleeps ]
I'm ready for either one.
I call anything
over the baby pool good.
You said that, right?
Officially?
That anything
over the baby pool is mint.
Yeah.
If you and your bike
make it over the baby pool,
I don't have to do this.
Clear.
Yes!
I have never selfishly hoped
that someone has made it...
as bad as I hope
you make this.
This is probably
the gnarliest hydro-skim
I've ever actually seen.
So, good luck.
Please make it
so I don't have to do it.
Hey. Happy trails.
Nice knowing you.
So he's gonna come
from over there,
through the hotel
and across the grass,
and he's gonna drop
eight, 1 0 inches
onto the pool.
And then he's gonna jump
the little pool,
land on the grass.
Hopefully the bike's
underneath him.
[ Tommy ] Right.
And then over the rocks,
into the ocean
and ride away?
Right.
[ Both Laughing ]
[ Engine Revving ]
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!
Go, Jim!
[ Shouting, Whooping ]
Are you okay?
Am I hurt?
You're okay!
[ Laughing ]
No good.
[ All Chattering ]
You needed to go faster.
That went as bad
as it could've gone.
Oh, my gosh.
This little blue piece
right here saved his life.
Had that not been here,
it would've been a back
or neck cracker on this.
Whoever came up
with that idea,
Jim owes them
a thousand handshakes.

Well, apparently Travis
is going to gear up
right now,
'cause that was
technically a fumble.
I actually don't want
Travis doing this.
I agree with you, but
I think he can do it.
That's the thing.
I think Trav can
skim through here
and get a touchdown.
If he does what Jim did,
Trav's going to the hospital.
If Trav dittos what Jim did-
busted shoulder, concussion.
Trav's head cannot-
He can't take it,
and his shoulder will buckle.
Jim didn't make the touchdown.
He didn't make the field goal.
Unfortunately, he didn't even
make the two-point conversion.
On his last drive,
he got the turnover.
And, uh, now it's my turn.
He didn't have enough speed
on a 450, and I'm gonna
try it on a 250.
This is the part of the show
where I crash, and then
Travis goes back,
"Oh, that's so easy."
He does it, no problem.
I'm gonna go have a beer.
I'm not even gonna watch him.
Ronald McDonald's
on his bike.
God, does he look stupid.
Why's he wearing
a diaper?
Aw- [ Bleeps ]

[ All Cheering, Whooping ]
- Way to go!
- I don't know what to say.
I can't believe it!
[ Shrieks ]
- Oh, my God!
- How the hell
did he do that?
I don't even know
how he hung on
to that.
He's such a douche.
I hate him.
He's way too good at things.
Way too good.
That speed was intense.
[ Erik ]
I hope he gets stung
by jellyfish right now.
Honestly.
You gotta give it
to Jim though.
"A"- going first.
"B"- on a bike that
weighed twice as much
as my bike weighed.
And "C"- he didn't have
all the goofy-looking
hockey pads.
He just frickin'
pinned it.
And he's a durable
son of a gun,
'cause he landed
flat on his face.
And he's still alive.
Thank you, Jim, again.
I think, a lot of times,
you just never expect
the worst-case scenario.
Hey, Tommy. Ever since
I've seen this stunt
in an old spy movie,
I've wanted
a piece of it.
Where'd you get
your instructions?
The Internet.
[ Laughing ]
We're totally safe.
They don't have fear.
They just don't-
They're scared of stuff,
but, in their minds,
they only think
about making it.
They never think of
what's gonna happen
if they don't.
When it comes to something
like flipping that car,
what you guys are doing
is mega sketchy.
[ Erik ]
Yeah, I know.
If you guys land
on your wheels,
I'll go nuts.
I don't think you're
going to though.
Be safe.

Jim, we're coming.
Stay still, buddy.
We need to cut him
out of this car.
Let's bring him
to the ground here.
Then we'll strap him in.
There's something
possibly with his neck,
so we gotta be really
gentle as possible,
okay?

We're taking care of you, pal.
You're gonna be all right.
We're getting you
to the hospital.
You're all set.
- We need to check you out.
- Nice work, everybody.
The difficult part for-
for any athlete is that,
you know, you have a crash,
if you're scared of that stuff
and you think about it-
When that deal happened
out there with Jim,
we were all scared.
And everybody
was worried about him.
[ Man ]
He's hurt.
He's really hurt.
He's in a situation that most
of us could be in and dread.

these guys are mentally
so strong.

[ Erik ]
Good morning, Panama.
Yet another day
of Nitro Circus,
and we are gap jumping
tricycles and bikes
over 400-foot buildings.
I just remember
the last shoot
that we did...
when the Big Wheels
fell apart.
The first guy
that went down,
the tire fell off.
The second guy that went down,
the handlebars went
all the way down.
Then Dusty went down,
and the bicycle went down.
We had a flat tire.
[ Man ]
We've come a long way
since then.
That was five days ago.
Oh, yeah.
This is so stupid.
God, this was such
a better idea on paper.
Everyone's a little worried
about safety.
Jeremy and I decided
we'd check and see...
what the worst-case scenario
might look like...
just to put
everyone's mind at ease.
Bombs away!
[ Jeremy ]
And launch her.
Oh, God.
Holy- [ Bleeps ]
Oh, my-
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my God!
[ Laughing, Murmurs ]
Seems perfectly safe
if anything goes wrong.
Why is it everything
that we do that's deadly...
also has to be sketchy?
You'd think, if it's deadly,
it would be a perfect setup,
but it's not.
It's always stupid.
All right, Spesh.
Come help me.
We all concur
that he is so scared
of not making the gap-
which, oh, granted,
that's death-
that he's gonna
go too far.
In which case, that's
just a broken back.
Um, so he's getting a push
by Special Greg.
That's a long way down.
I hope we make it.
All right, Erik.
Three, two, one.
[ Bleeps ]
[ Cheering, Whooping ]
Hold on, hold on.
You okay?
You all right?
That was the biggest
jump ever.
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
That was so high
and so far.
- Fill it up again.
- [ Laughing ]
If you're gonna flip,
then just go ahead
and flip it.
If you're not gonna flip,
then we'll roshambo it.
I'd rather see me crash
than you crash.
No, we're gonna land this.
I'd rather see me land
than you land.
So we'll roshambo
for who gets the privilege.
I'm already over here.
All right. Well, just jump
and meet me over here.
We'll have a cocktail later.
All right.
Good luck.
That's what you call
reverse psychology.
I definitely
did not wanna flip.
I'm scared- [ Bleeps ]-
even trying to jump.
That worked.
That worked great.
Couldn't have asked
for anything better.
Thanks, Greg.
So the plan is to go
twice as high
and twice as far.
ls that the plan?
That'll do better
for you.
That'll work, right?
All right.
Love you guys.
Love you, pal.
[ Cheering, Whooping ]
All right. [ Bleeps ]
Line it up.
I am covered
head to toe.
You look like
a homemade action figure.
[ Laughing ]
All right, well, Rubberneck,
you accidentally
went too far...
and almost got
all the way
in the boxes.
So, Jim, let's
get all the way
to the boxes.
Give me a push.
I mean a push.
All right.
I can tell
Travis is nervous.
Because whenever he gets
nervous, he's, like-

I just hear him
chirping up there
like a bird.
