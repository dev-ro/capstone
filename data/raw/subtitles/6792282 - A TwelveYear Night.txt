The man looked at the Convict
and asked the Officer:
Does the prisoner know his sentence?
No - said the Officer-
He will experience it on his own body.
Franz Kafka. In the Penal Colony.
Uruguay is under a dictatorship
after several decades of democracy.
The Tupamaro Revolutionary Movement
has been defeated.
Its survivors are in prison.
On September 7th, nine Tupamaro prisoners
are secretly taken hostage
by the military government.
This is the story of three of them.
A 12-YEAR NIGHT
Troops!
Proceed!
- Move in!
- Quickly, quickly!
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
Let's go, move it!
Quickly!
Let's go, keep moving!
Come on! Move in!
I need to take a shit.
Quiet, little shit!
Pepe?
Ñato.
Quiet! No talking!
- Ruso, is that you?
- Silence!
Keep your mouth shut, little shit!
Then I'll have to shit right here.
Sorry, guys.
Silence!
Let's go, in the truck!
There's crap everywhere.
It stinks.
Come on, in the truck.
Let's go, let's go!
Quickly!
Come on, keep walking!
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
I've brought prisoners.
José Mujica, Eleuterio Fernández
Huidobro and Mauricio Rosencof.
Take them away.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, keep walking!
Inside!
Hold him there.
Soak it in gasoline.
More, more...
- Suffocate him.
- No!
I can't breathe!
We're going to light you on fire.
Hold still.
We're lighting you on fire, hold still.
No!
Son of a bitch!
Shut up.
Hold still. Hold still right there.
On your feet!
Stand against the wall.
Stand still.
Facing the wall without touching it.
Don't move.
Hold still.
Hold still, don't look at me.
Face the wall.
Hold still.
ABANDON ALL HOPE,
YOU WHO ENTER HERE.
Here, little shit.

He could use a kick in the kidneys.
A gymnasticist!
You stay still. Understood?
12 MONTHS LATER
These guys can't talk to anyone.
Nobody can talk to them.
Remember that they're seditious
and subversive.
Traitors to our country.
They're very dangerous.
They can be incredibly convincing.
Contact with them must be minimum.
We're the National Army.
It took us years to win this war.
And remember that humanity
was always saved
at the last minute
by a firing squad.
My dear Ruso,
I'm here because your family
is pestering us.
I'll let you see them,
but don't make things harder,
because you'll make it harder
for them, and for you.
And you love your family a lot, right?
You know what this is?
It's a resolution from
Army Central Command.
If any attack happens,
we'll have to kill you.
And you know that's easy.
You're not prisoners anymore.
You're hostages.
We should have killed you
when we could.
Now we're going to drive you crazy.
You lost the war, Pepe.
Now you are doomed.
And you wanted to change the world?
Just look at yourselves.
I would kill myself.
Why don't you kill yourselves?
Stay still.
I said stay still.
Look, this is barbaric.
A firing squad
would be more humane.
Rosencof, get ready.
Dad.
Hi!
How are you, sweetheart?
What beautiful eyes you have.
And school?
How are things at school?
- We brought you food.
- Thanks, Mom.
- And notebooks and books...
- Thanks, Mom.
- How are you, darling?
- Fine.
You're so big!
What a lovely surprise.
What do you do here every day?
We walk.
You have recess?
Yeah, sure.
We brought Alejandrita's
new glasses to show you.
Put them on.
Wait, wait.
Tell him to close his eyes.
Close your eyes.
I'm closing them.
They're closed.
- Can I open them?
- Yes.
They look beautiful on you.
Oh, Dad. These glasses make me cry.
No, sweetie. Don't use them
if they make you cry.
They make her cry?
The lenses make her cry.
Isaac...
Hey, Dad. Are you okay?
What's wrong?
- Who is he?
- Mauricio.
I came to see my son.
- Isaac, please.
- Dad, it's me.
- Where is my son?
- Calm down.
- Isaac, sit down.
- Where is my son?
- I came to see my son.
- Sit down.
- Dad, it's me.
- No, please, sit down.
Sit down.
No!
Isaac!
Dad, are you okay?
Dad!
Don't move!
Dad!
- Isaac, no!

Dad, it's me!
Dad, it's me!
Let's go!
Come on!

Where is Pepe?
No idea.
Checkmate.
Checkmate how?
With queen on D4.
You're shitting me.
Queen D4 I win.
Arguing with you...
is like talking to a wall.
Hurry up. Crap quickly.
I can't like this.
I can't squat, I can't shit.
What do you want me to do?
Loosen it a little bit for me.
I'm not authorized.
So I'll have to shit all over the place...
Corporal, there's a problem.
He can't reach the toilet.
He can't defecate.
Show me.
I can't bend over.

The prisoner is tied...
Faster, faster!
In the neighborhood...
- Sergeant, sir.

- Attention!

- What's going on?
A complicated circumstance.
You see, Lieutenant?
This is the situation we have.
You call me for this?
You can't solve this yourself?
Captain, we have a problem
in the bathroom.
Is it clogged?
You really need to take a crap?
Major, sir.
Attention!
Are you all retards?
Can somebody come in here?

VICTORY OR DEATH
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.
I'm here to see my son.
- Who?
- José Mujica.
The courthouse said he might be here.
Your ID.
Sign this and wait here.
I brought you mate
and dulce de leche.
The shirt you like.
How's the neighborhood?
The neighborhood is fine.
And Grandpa?
Grandpa misses you.
Ma'am!
They're checking documentation!
Why don't you wait inside?
No, I'm fine right here.
Mom.
Stop coming.
As long as I'm alive, I'll come.
Even if I have to crawl.
Ma'am!
I'm sorry, but your son isn't available.
He isn't here?
I don't have that information.
Where is he?
I don't have that information.
What information do you have?
The information I gave you.
But what information did you give me?
I don't have that information.
Mom, come here!
Come back!

That's it.

I knew her because she was
Ñango's ex-girlfriend.
And I always liked her.
We started dancing
and I got closer to her.
She smelled like soap.
So clean.
I hadn't been around that in a long time.
- Brunette?
- Yeah.
We danced to like two songs
and she said come tomorrow.
I put on cologne, a nice shirt...
When I went, she wasn't there.
I don't know if she stood me up.
I should have got answered.
I left her flowers, chocolates...
- Which flowers?
- The flowers were...
The ones with yellow in the middle.
- Daisies.
- Right, daisies.
I know women, always the same.
It happened to me once.
- They leave you hanging.
- What did you do?
Nothing, I never saw her again.
I think they were mocking me.
There was something.
You know when you feel it?
We made eye contact...
By the third song
we were closer together...
And she gave me a kiss
right here on the cheek.
And I was like, "No..."
Stop! Stop...
Silence!
Stop, Barriola, please.
- Barriola?
- Stop.
How do you know my name?
You never stop talking! The girl,
the ex-boyfriend, the dance, the kiss...
You need to move.
She's interested, but make a move.
Shut your mouth!
Let me think. Listen.
Maybe her boyfriend is in town
and that's why she's ignoring you.
How do you know?
Shut up or I'll kick your ass.
Here's what we'll do.
Bring me down a pen
and paper and I'll help you.
- I want to help you, really.
- Shut up!
You have to surprise women, Barriola.
Bring me a pen and paper...
I'll stick the pen up your ass!
Please, Barriola, let's solve this.
I can't listen to you anymore.
Stop calling me by my name!
Hey, little shit.
What do you want
the paper and pen for?
For you to write her a letter.
What for?
Because you said she was hot,
I thought you liked her.
You dictate,
I'll write it down.
But I'm warning you,
if you're pulling my leg,
I'll kick your ass.
"And here, in the infinite solitude
of guard duty,
imprisoned by your absence..."
Slow down, slow down.
"Imprisoned by your absence,
I can feel my tear ducts
quivering."
And? What now?
- What do you mean?
- What do I do?
You send it to her, soldier!
On your feet, let's go.
Shitty Tupamaro.
When the sergeant gets here
you'll get the club.
Take off his hood, soldier.
Everyone get out.
Everybody out!
Move it!
So you're the writer.
Look, I have a problem.
There's a girl I like.
I heard you can help me.
Who is she?
What's she like?
She's...
brunette, pretty...
I met her last week.
We were playing around.
I asked her out,
but she doesn't want to.
What's her name?
Nelly.
- Brunette, you said?
- Yeah.
She works with her mom in the bakery.
And she makes warm bread
in the morning?
Yeah, that bread with fat.
Just...
sign it with your name
so it looks better.
Thank you.
Can I keep the notebook?
Please.
Thank you.
Soldiers!
Take him away.
I brought hot bread.
Thank you.
We went out last night.
But the girl is very confused,
she has a lot of doubts.
What doubts, if I may ask?
I...
got married very young.
I was still in the militia
and I met another girl.
When I went back home,
I was a different man.
I had changed a lot.
I have a daughter from that marriage.
She's all grown up.
She doesn't talk to me.
That hurts.
And now that I want
to make a new life for myself,
it's like a pebble in my shoe.
Sergeant,
we all make mistakes.
Goal!
Goal!
Help me.
How do I answer?
What are you looking for with her?
I don't know, I'm older now.
I don't want to end my life alone,
I want to end it with her.
Should I write that?
You're the writer.
What would you do?
I wouldn't tell her yet.
We need to make her fall in love first.
Yes.
Of you.
Of me.
Of the air.
Of the shadow of before.
Of after.
Of who knows love.
Give me back the Word.
Keep pedalling, I'm letting go.
Good, sweetie!
Keep going!
Good! You're on your own!
Look at me, Daddy!
Raise my hood.
Please, only for a second.

Keep moving, let's go.
Where the fuck are we?
Please, where are we?
Where are we?
Open up!
Let us out of here!
Don't play dumb, Mujica.
Tell me about...
your contacts.
I'm not going to think,
I'm not going to think...
You must have contacts...
I'm not going to think!
I'm not going to think!
You won't get shit out of me!
I'm not going to think!
What are your next movements?
What are you saying?
Speak clearly!
What are you saying? Speak clearly!
Tell me what you want!
Are you on my left or right?
What the fuck?
What are you saying?
What? Go ahead, talk!
Speak!
Go ahead!
I'm not going to think in my head!
You won't get shit out of me!
I'm not going to think!
Let him out!
Let us out of here!
Let him out!
Pepe!
Let us out!
Come here if you're a man!
Come here!
Hi, Ñato.
Ñato.
There's someone I want you to meet.
She was born in the barracks
and she wants to meet you, Ñato.
She wants to meet you.
Gabrielita.
Gabrielita wants to meet you,
but it's not easy.
They're constantly moving you.
You're in Melo now,
and I'm in Punta Rieles.
I don't want her to see me like this.
She'll think her father is living dead.
Ñato...
She'll think she has no father.
Ñato...
This will be over soon.
What do we do?
No, Sir. No, Sir.
Tell me, Mujica.
Who are your contacts here?
What do you know about Ortega?
What is it you propose?
Tell me about...
the Nicaraguan revolution.
Communists are all the same,
none of you know anything.
Only when it suits you.
Do you agree yes, or do you agree no?
Another round?
We have to figure out
how we'll get the tools.
We have to try them out.
And the noise.
We have to try them out
and do noise tests.
She said it would be fine.
The basement?
- The basement is perfect.
- Can you hear outside?
You can't hear anything. It's huge.
Thank you.
Add two people to the middle column.
- That's where people will come.
- Try them out.
How are we going to do it?
The casino is open
from 8 to 5. Only during carnival.
- How many will participate?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen maximum.
That's a lot.
The Tupamaros have pulled off what people
are calling the heist of the century
against the multi-million-dollar
tobacco company Maihlos.
Thanks to documents
revealed by the Tupamaros
the judge ordered a prison sentence
for Narciso Eduardo Maihlos
for tax fraud and contraband.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Another round?
Do you know you're being recorded?
Do you know?
Anything else?
Pepe.
Pepe.
You're being recorded.
You have an antenna.
The basement?
The basement is perfect.
Can you hear outside?
You can't hear anything. It's huge.
- How are we going to do it?
- Only during carnival.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Another round?
Sorry.
I got the lyrics wrong.
Mom?
Identification.
Sit down.
Damn it, sit down!
Stop, stop!
Stop, Pepe!
In a successful operation carried out
by the Montevideo police,
a rebel from a known gang of conspirers
was seriously wounded.
The stranger who was carrying fake ID
turned out to be José Alberto Mujica.
Wanted for some time
as a member of the organization.
Mujica is now being held
in a military hospital
in critical condition.
How old are you, kid?
You hadn't even been born
when they put us in here.
They forgot about us.
They forgot about us.

And if this were
my last poem,
rebellious and sad,
worn out but whole,
I would only write one word:
Companion.
Visit tomorrow.
First time see Gabrielita.
I'm scared, Ruso.
You have a daughter.
What do I do?
Tell her a story.
I don't know any.
Tell her this one:
Then the little girl receives a gift:
A machine that makes her dreams
come true.
Then one day the girl
was with her mother
and her mother said:
"Go and feed the blue chicks."
"Mom, there's no such thing
as blue chicks."
"Go anyway."
And when she went to feed them,
she started hearing chicks
cheeping everywhere.
- Cheep, cheep!
- Right.
- Cheep, cheep!
- That's right.
That night, when she goes to bed,
she lies down to sleep
and she dreams of elephants.
When she wakes up the next day,
she sees elephants
walking around her house
and she says,
"Look, Mom! Elephants!"
Thirty seconds.
Gabi, the next time you come,
I'll finish the story, okay?
Daddy, why don't you have any hands?
No, I do have hands.
It's just that my hands
transform as well.
They turn into animals, look.
Look.
A butterfly.
What do butterflies do?
That's it.
A monkey.
A dog.
The visit is over.
Bye, Gabi. I love you a lot.
Francisco Franco's heart

Caudillo of Spain...
...after intervention by the army...
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
won the Oscar
for Best Picture and its actors,
Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher
won Best Actor and Best Actress.
For the signing of the agreement
at Camp David,
attended by the ex-President
of the United States,
Jimmy Carter...
It might hail the next few days
in some areas of Uruguay...
They have the basics, a bed,
a curtain, light,
we're always attentive
to requirements for general hygiene,
rations or anything else
they might request,
they're attended to...
Say anything stupid
and we'll rip your head off.
Got it?
What is your name?
State your name.
Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro.
Are you all right?
The prisoner is fine.
I'd like to hear it from him.
INTERNATIONAL
RED CROSS COMMITTEE
They barely feed us.
We're not allowed to talk to each other.
We have nothing.
We've never seen a judge.
We have nothing at all!
They don't feed us!
They won't even let us
go to the bathroom!
The Red Cross dictates that
all prisoners must be treated fairly.
- You want to use the bathroom?
- Of course I do.
Take him to the bathroom immediately!
What is your name?
State your name.
Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro.
Dismissed.
I said dismissed.
State your name.
Mauricio Rosencof.
Dismissed.
What is your name?
José Alberto Mujica.
Dismissed.
Attention. Ten-hut!
Take off his hood and get out.
What the fuck is that?
They made me come from Montevideo
for that crap so talk fast.
Are you taking up arms again?
What bullshit is that?
Contact with the outside?
What for and who?
What is the point of all this?
Go ahead.
I remember how to make you talk.
I'm being nice to you
so don't treat me like a fool.
Did you make this?
Give me the code.
The message, damn it!
Give me the message right now!
It's not a message,
it's a martingale.
A system of chances to play roulette.
Are you fucking with me?
May I?
A is the initial bet.
B is the chance of losing.
And N is the number of tries
between the maximum and minimum bet.
Let's suppose
your maximum bet is 1,000
and the minimum is 10.
You have to always play
two chips at a time either red or black.
That way the chances of winning
are higher. It's 50.5 %.
So A=7, P=5
and N=0,53.
That gives you a chance
at winning of 20, 40,
60, 80, 120, 360,
460...
You guys never change.
Do you really think you'll beat
a whole system?
It's too bad I didn't kill you
when I had the chance.
Neither of us will ever forget that day.
APRIL 14TH, 1972
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.
Mom, I forgot my pencil case.
Oh, darling.
Don't worry, go inside and I'll go home
and bring it to you.
Have fun.
Bye.
Today, April 14th, 1972,
we leave behind Uruguay's
bloodiest day in the 20th century.
MLN Tupamaro commandos
have taken action
against men they identified
as members of the Death Squad.
In only hours, deputy commissioner
of the Interior
Armando Acosta has died
as well as deputy commissioner
Delega, Officer Leites,
navy captain...
This is a declaration of war.
...deputy commissioner Reyes.
At ten this morning...
Turn it off.
What?
Turn off the radio.
I don't hear anything.
Exactly.
Something's wrong.
Move in!
Answer it.
They're down too.
Move out.
Tell me your name.
What's your name?
Luis Martirena.
Luis Martirena.
Good. So you're alive.
At 2 P.M. at Amazonas Street...
What do we do?
...near Aconcagua,
in the Malvín neighborhood,
shots were fired between authorities
and Tupamaro guerrillas.
Two guerrillas were killed.
Authorities continue to search...
Did you hear that?
There were four of them.
Only two dead.
...different clashes
and the city of Montevideo...
They're alive.
Call Marcos and Cabrera.
We have to prepare a rescue team.
Shout that there are two of us.
Shout my ass.
I'm not leaving here alive.
What's going on?
Lower your weapon.
There are two of us!
We surrender!
We surrender!
The world is full of idealists.
Hell is full of good intentions.
This is your hell.
I take responsibility for my mistakes
and the consequences.
No, you take responsibility
for neither.
We forced you to take responsibility.
Your defeat
forces you to.
I did what I did because I believed in it.
I'm responsible and I accept
my punishment.
Not you or anyone else
will take me for defeated.
So you're not defeated?
It's not the years that passed,
but think about the years that await you.
You'll never get out of here.
I might die here,
but when that happens,
I know the weight of my burden.
But you,
do you know how much yours weighs?
I belonged to this world.
Now everything is foreign to me.
The sunrise,
the sound of the birds...
You're foreign to me.
- Hello, son. How are you?
- Fine, Mom.
Grandpa sends his love.
Always reminding me
to bring you things.
He says: "Don't forget to bring
dulce de leche
and two kilos of mate."
I know they're going
to take away some things,
but something might be left.
- Is that okay?
- Mom.
You have to stop coming.
What?
Why?
It's too long to explain, Mom.
They're persecuting us,
it's like an attack
with sound, ultrasound, I don't know.
My ear is hot. Listen, Mom.
They put a voice or an antenna
inside me.
I can't stop thinking.
Whenever I stop, they attack me again.
They haven't gotten into
my thoughts for a while...
Stop.
What matters is I have it
all under control.
- But you have to not come for a while.
- Son...
What do you think they are?
- Nuns in a charity?
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Listen to me!
I'm the one you have
to listen to. I'm your mother.
They want to drive you crazy.
You can't let them.
Do you understand?
Mom...
Mom my ass!
Mom my ass!
Listen to me.
Listen to what I have to say.
You have to resist.
Resist
any way you can,
no matter what happens.
Resist and don't let them kill you.
I don't know how.
Yes, you do.
The only defeated
are the ones who stop fighting.
You'll get through this and move on.
And nobody...
Nobody will take
what you have inside.
Heat the water at least.
168 years ago today,
by the hand of our leader,
our magnificent commander,
one of a kind on Earth,
when the people gathered
to seek their freedom...
I want my mate and my potty!
I need to take a shit!
I want my mate and my potty!
Fucking son of a bitch!
I want my potty!
Remembering the historic process...
Give me back my potty!
And my mate!
You're going to smell
what comes out of my ass!
Your Sunday clothes will stink!
I want my potty!
I need to take a shit!
Filthy bastard!
I want my potty!
Fucking son of a bitch!
Be quiet.
Come here, Sapito!
Come here!
Come here, Sapito!
Come here!
Bring your bayonet,
just you and me.
Come on, you and me.
How do you know I'm Sapito?
Want me to tell them you cheated
on your wife with that whore?
Sapito cheated on his wife!
You hear me?
Sapito has a lover!
Son of a bitch!
Do they know you got syphilis?
- Because you fucked her...
- Where did you hear that?
- Sapito has syphilis!
- Shut the fuck up!
What the fuck do you want?
My potty and my mate.
That my mom brought.
And bring some hot water
for the mate.
I don't like the water warm.
- Maybe he has a periscope.
- He definitely has a periscope.
Do you even know what a periscope is?
What are you talking about, moron?
We need to keep an eye
on this filthy bastard.
We'll have to call our superiors.
So, tell me.
You have a device, an antenna.
Who put it there?
How should I know, doctor?
I imagine the army,
the CIA, I don't know.
What does it say?
It's a voice here.
It insults me.
It wants to control my thoughts,
get information out of me...
It sends me an electric pulse,
it sends me heat here, in my ear...
A fire here burns me.
Have you had any
episodes of anxiety, distress,
fear?
Any stressful situations?
Do you sleep well? Do you rest?
Yeah, he rests.
Do you eat right?
More or less.
He eats everything we give him.
Soldier, I need to work calmly.
So bring some water, please.
Go and get some water.
Mujica, all of these symptoms you have
appear to be...
a delusional psychosis.
We still don't know if it's chronic,
if it's acute...
We need more time to evaluate.
But that's what's making you feel...
confused and unable to reason.
Part of your disorder has to do with
not being able to rest.
Right now what will help you
the most is sleeping at night.
Take some pills and sleep.
That's what I'm going to prescribe.
I don't need to sleep, doctor.
- You don't? And what do you need?
- To stop thinking.
What will help you
to stop thinking?
To use my hands,
to organize my head.
To write,
read...
To read and write.
I'll have them send you something
to read and paper
and a pen to write with.
I haven't read in 7 years.
You have to cling to anything
you can right now, Mujica.
Anything that you have at hand.
Are you religious?
Do you believe in God?
What god would do this?
The only one we've got,
unfortunately.
If the god you believe in remains silent,
and you say I'm crazy,
what do I cling to?
You're the first
woman I've seen in years.
I haven't seen the stars
or light for years.
And you talk to me
about reason, what reason?
Look, I'm going to tell you a story.
When I was 15 years old,
I saw my mother die of cancer.
And that was when I decided
to become a doctor.
So I studied and got my degree.
I saw hundreds, thousands of patients
those 20 years.
But one day I got up
and didn't want to come to work.
I couldn't leave the house,
I couldn't get up.
I didn't want to talk to anyone.
And I thought and I thought
and I thought.
Like you.
Until I realized
that no matter what I did,
my mother
would still be dead.
That's when I got up
and went back to work.
And here I am, doing what I can,
asking you to do what you can.
To cling to anything you can.
Ma'am.
All set? Can I take him?
Yes.
Soldier.
I need him to sign the diagnosis.
All right.
I'll get you something
to read and write.
Be strong.
Survive.
It's almost over.
Come on, Mujica.
Yes, for my country.
Yes, for Uruguay.
Yes, for progress
and yes, for peace.

...we're going to vote.
Yes, for greatness.
Yes, for Uruguay.
Voting booths have closed
with 20 % of the votes counted.
Here are the results:
39 % "no," 61 % "yes."
In Maldonado...
Are we "yes" or "no"?
I don't know.
Take this, little shit!
It's a disgrace, a disgraceful defeat.
- What will happen?
- Who knows?
Against all predictions,
with 80 % of all votes counted,
the surprising defeat of the "yes" vote
has been confirmed.
The Uruguayan people
said a resounding "no"
to the constitutional project
proposed by the government,
which is now headed
for a period of negotiation
towards a possible democracy.

Doctor, I want a detailed report
on the condition of this guy
they've sent us.
Get out.
Everybody out!
Rosencof.
You're back here again?
Sergeant.
And your girlfriend?
Congratulations.
Thank you.
But she reproaches me:
"When we were going out
you used to write me,
but not anymore."
Tell me, what can I do for you?
Pepe.
Ruso. Ruso.
We're alone.
We're alone.
Do you see anything?
We're heading south.
What do you see?

Yeah, yeah.
He's on the fourth floor.
And Arriosa?
No, Ñato. Arriosa isn't.

No, Ñato. Sanzo went down too.
We never heard anything again.

He disappeared.
They took him one day. No idea.

Mujica, get ready.
Sign here.
It confirms that
you were treated correctly.
This doesn't end here.
Don't get your hopes up.
When you're out, we'll find you
and nobody will save you there.
You hear me?
There are no political
responsibilities out there.
I wish you the best.
Ñato!
We're leaving.
Come on, Ñato, we're leaving!
What are you doing?
Why are you still washing?
For the next ones.
If I were you, I'd get moving.
Dad!
Jorge Benitez' family!
- Grandpa!
- Dad!
WE DIDN'T FORGET YOU
Carlos González' family!
Roberto Hipólito's family!
Washington González' family!
Marcelo Jiménez' family!
Is that Daddy?
I don't know, wait and see.
Daddy!

Where is your bird?
Where?
Tell me where your bird is.
My bird is a dream
and it flew away.
My bird is a dream...
