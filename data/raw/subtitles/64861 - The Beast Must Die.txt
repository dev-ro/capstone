Shut up!
THIS MAN MUST DIE
Michel!
I would have killed a man.
I know neither name, address nor looks
But I'll find him and kill him.
Were you sick?
Yes, in a way.
Nothing serious, I hope?
No...
not as you mean.
In that hospital,
they'd revive a corpse.
My sister's brother-in-law
I'm living with them
works in there as a male nurse.
A tall red head. Andre Duplessis.
Know him?
Their Dr. Duverger is A-1.
And the food, first-class too.
The prices, of course
You're lucky all the same.
The swine!
Sorry?
I meant that signpost.
3 months ago, a kid was killed here.
They could've thought about it before.
Authorities, you know
There was some mizzle, as usual.
You hurt your feet, it seems.
You had the curtains cleaned. Good.
Where's my boat?
A mast fell down. Old Coudec
is repairing it.
Very good.
You've repaired that.
Now listen carefully.
This is very important.
Never speak about "that".
Not the slightest reference.
You promise?
Lf, some day,
you have to talk about him
do it at the present tense,
As if
I know it's stupid
but I prefer it.
Let's drop that.
Did you obey my orders?
Is his room empty?
Yes. I gave everything to
my niece's son.
And the toys?
I couldn't!
No, I couldn't!
It may take 6 months,
one or two years
but I'll find him.
I'll make friends with him
I'll wait patiently.
When he's trapped, I'll look at
him with a smile.
Directly in the eye
And I'll make him deserve his death!
I've some work to do.
Let no one disturb me.
If the phone rings I'm not here
I said I had work to do!
But, sir
Leave me alone!
But... it's the Police.
Gentlemen.
Come in, gentlemen.
Please sit down.
Sit down
Just one moment.
- Well?
- The investigation is going on.
Vainly, of course?
We've put ads throughout the region.
To inform everyone
Every garage in the area
has been visited.
The collision surely damaged the car.
We've been inquiring about repairs.
The pump assistants were questioned.
My men went everywhere.
Nothing.
I expected as much.
Might as well look
for a needle in a haystack.
In a haystack?
I wouldn't put it in a haystack.
I'd hide it in a needle-case.
Meaning?
The best way to hide a small dent
is to cause a bigger one.
What would I do to hide an accident?
I'd create a second.
I'd drive into a wall, a tree, anything.
It'd cover the first collision.
Yes, we must find out
if another accident
happened that day.
We took care of that.
The idea isn't new.
There are different possibilities.
Perhaps the car hasn't
been damaged
which is unlikely.
Or maybe the guy put it
in a private garage.
In that case, it's still there
Or he might have
repaired it himself.
If this hypothesis is right
does it inform us about the man?
It does.
If he repaired the car himself
it means he's an expert
and has the necessary tools.
You straighten a wing
with a hammer.
But
he must have worked
during the night
Because
hammering... at night...
makes a ruckus
The noise would've woken
the neighbours.
A wing can be removed and
then replaced.
Let me go on.
If he replaced himself
a wing or a head-light
he's a good mechanic.
He's likely to work in a garage.
Or
Perhaps he's the owner of a garage
and can use his spare parts
without having to tell anyone.
A bit imaginary.
No, no... wait.
My son was crossing
from left to right.
He was thrown to the left.
Then the left wing was damaged.
We must find a left front wing!
May I help you?
Yes. I've a little trouble with my car
Where's your car?
At my place.
You'd better bring it here,
don't you think?
No, no, it's not much.
I can do it myself.
If you've a front wing.
Oh a wing! What kind of car is it?
A 404.
I've no wings for A 404.
No wings!
Well... if you had some old parts
I might find what I need.
An old stock of wings?
We fix them and throw out the junk
We don't keep them. I've no wings.
What would we do with them?
My apologies
Sorry. I'd have liked to help you.
It's okay. Thank you.
I've found it.
Take it, then.
Yes... that's it.
Careful with my tools.
But that's completely ruined!
Less than mine. I'll put it right.
- Didn't you say a left wing?
- Yes
That's a right wing.
The result is rather disappointing.
Five exhausting weeks for nothing.
Or almost nothing.
Dead ends.
False hopes
which leave me desperate.
I realize that
my search is limitless.
I'm only a human being
tracking another.
My only arm is my patience.
I have all the time.
I have all my life.
And all his.
Unless chance interferes.
Chance is wonderful.
And it exists.
It's the only thing that exists.
The point of my pen on this paper
is like everything in the world
a coincidence.
I bet you're stuck.
You're not the first.
Same thing every time it rains.
There's always one to get stuck.
And sometimes, even two or three.
What can we do?
Do you know anything about cars?
Hell, no!
I don't either.
Wow... say... well
Last time, it happened
to someone important
an actress, a movie star
a fine girl.
She was in a sports car.
A Mustang, my son said.
A swell girl!
The guy with her,
he fumed because
the front of the car was damaged
I remember it well.
It was on the 3rd of January.
Yes, the night of January 3rd
- On January 3rd?
- Yes, January 3rd.
What a fine girl! And not proud.
She was a bit wiry. She was crying.
I said: "Don't take it so badly.
Nobody's hurt"
What was her name?
That I can't tell you.
I saw her on the telly.
In a programme... that was called
It was called... I forget that too!
Too bad.
But my son knows all about that.
He knows all the stars.
He knows too many.
Why?
Are you interested?
Yes, it's amusing to
think that a star.
When are you going home?
Why don't we go right now ok?
A glass of wine would cheer you up.
Then I'll pull your car out
with my tractor.
Okay, let's go.
Say, you're a Parisian?
- Where's Jean-Franois?
- At the dairy.
Tell him to come here.
Be careful, it isn't very clean.
Make yourself at home.
Sit down.
I'll go and get my son.
Come this way.
January 3rd.
It'd be a weird coincidence.
I never thought it could be a woman.
But I won't have any scruples
with her either.
I can see her.
She drives right into the mud,
on purpose
to wash away my son's blood.
Will you get away!
Tell the lady's name to
this gentleman.
Helen Lanson.
Don't know her.
You don't know Helen Lanson?
No. I never go to the movies,
and have no t.v.
I'll show you her photo,
You've seen her no doubt.
Let's have a drink.
Will you join me?
They don't show enough
poetry on the TV.
Helen Lanson... yes.
The name of the programme?
"The Cathari".
You were right... A fine girl.
On the other hand,
the guy was rotten.
What a fine car!
And the man...
what was his name?
I don't know.
But he was sure most rude.
He kept giving her hell.
And... how can I say he had
a tough gaze.
That's it... a tough gaze.
Her husband, do you think?
Her husband dare I say, right!
How do you know?
She doesn't like the guy,
don't know why
She didn't even see him
Your health!
I wonder what you see in
that girl. I've told you.
She's exactly like the girl
in my screenplay.
Working for the movies, now?
Like everybody else?
Why not?
It won't keep me from writing
whenever I feel like it.
What time does she arrive?
I don't even know if she'll come.
Usually, this is her last call.
Another drink?
Two scotches.
Yeah. Poor Helen!
She could be rather good
if she had interesting parts.
But she never
she was never given her chance?
She hasn't got any herself.
She's a Jonah.
A... what?
A Jonah. Got it?
Here she comes.
Let's go and dance.
You're late!
Cool isn't it?
How are you? Okay?
How are you doing?
The fair Helen of Troy!
- Very funny.
- It's an old joke.
You're just in time.
You've got a new admirer.
I don't believe you
Well, sit down.
He looks rooted to the spot!
Have a drink.
His name's Marc,
a talented author.
It was not very hard.
The lady isn't shy at all.
And not dumb either.
She's even subtle and amusing.
So far she hasn't made an error.
That's a nice place.
The best restaurant in Paris.
The cooking is fine, isn't it?
Sometimes, she seems to
wonder about my aims.
I let the mystery drag
I never made the least
advance to her.
She must be at a loss.
If she only knew!
I gave her only my pseudonym
"Marc Andrieux", my pen-name.
Who would think I'm Charles Thenier
whose son was killed in Bretane?
I'm waiting for her.
It's the first time she comes over
I don't know how I'm going to act.
Not for a second will
my resolution weaken.
If she is guilty
she will die.
I would prefer
Come in.
How are you?
Give that to me.
Go in.
Sit down.
Do you want a drink?
- Yes
- Whiskey?
Whiskey
With or without
Without.
Filthy weather, isn't it?
There's no more spring, summer
Fall, winter. No more
- If I were God
- Marc!
What are you getting at?
What do you mean?
You take me to restaurants,
Why?
I think it's very pleasant.
Don't you?
Well, then?
You talked about a screenplay.
Is there one?
I'm working on it.
I jot down notes.
I think about it a lot
Show them to me.
Yes... of course.
That's too stupid
They must be
My secretary must have
- Marc!
- Yes
Let's be frank.
What do you want of me?
Well... Listen
You're not
a little girl, after all. It's not very
Hard to... to understand
Pretend I'm a little girl
and tell me.
Well, since you want me
to say platitudes
I'll tell you that
you're lovely.
You're charming
I like you a lot.
And?
From the day you came into my life
I haven't slept
I haven't eaten
I don't drink much
The birds' songs
and the flowers smell stuffy.
Satisfied?
No.
Didn't know this kind
of man still existed
It's not what you think.
Are you married... or virtuous?
Neither.
Do you want to kiss me?
Yes
Funny guy!
Tea or coffee?
Tea.
With fried eggs and jam?
Yes... I'm hungry!
Yes, hold this.
Put it there.
It smells good!
It's nothing.
Some day, I'll cook
a peppered sauce hare
or a shepherd's pie, you'll see!
Where are the spoons?
Here. Sorry.
Make your choice.
They're not very pretty.
Aren't you well off?
No. But anyway I'm a bachelor.
I live in lodgings.
Why?
Because I travel a lot.
That's why I haven't
Objects make me sick!
Me too. Less so out here
I'd like to live in the country
Where are you from?
Can't you ask me nicely?
I was born in Brittany
Got some relatives there?
My grandmother and my sister.
And... any friends?
Not many.
My brother-in-law.
Isn't he a member of your family?
Yes... No matter.
Where does he live?
In Quimper.
He owns a garage.
Very clever!
Sorry.
I never learned to use all 10 fingers.
What were we saying?
Yes, you said he has a garage.
Who?
Your brother-in-law.
Yes. And he's got lots of money.
It's the biggest garage
in the country
What's his name?
Maybe I know him, I often
Go to Brittany,
in the region where I love
Paul Decourt.
It would surprise me if you knew him
No, I don't.
You said he's a funny guy.
Funny?
No, he isn't funny.
He's rather unpleasant.
I don't see why he interests you.
Everything that concerns you
interests me very much
That's nice.
The only nice thing since...
this morning
You see him often?
Who?
Your brother-in-law.
No. I don't see him much,
almost never
Why?
I can't figure him out
He's a nervous wreck
He makes one laugh,
but it's not funny
No. I don't find it funny either.
I'm not laughing
Are you annoyed?
I am and I don't wish to talk about it.
Got any cigarettes?
Yes, in my room.
On the writing-desk.
Is that your teddy bear?
- Drop that!
- Why?
Give it to me.
Drop it! Drop it!
It's a priceless gift
- Are you crazy?
- Give that to me!
I'll give it back once you tell me
who it belongs to?
It's my nephew's, he's dead.
It means a lot. Give it back
Wait a minute.
Give it to me!
Why can't I touch
your nephew's teddy bear?
Because give me that
To you, I'm dirty girl.
You want to see what
I think of this bear?
Stop!
You want to kill me?
Please forgive me.
Me too
I acted like a fool.
I should've controlled myself.
That bear, impregnated
with my son's kisses...
is nothing but horsehair and plush.
I'm strangely taken
by this rash girl
Her nervous break-down
proves she's more a victim
than at fault.
Which doesn't mean
unfavorably that
I plan on giving up my scheme
I've come to conclude
That under close examination
Consciousness is paid more dearly
than anything in the world
I succeeded in persuading her.
We are going to Quimper.
I showed anxiety,
for my love of brittany
And I returned her wish
to be introduced to her family.
That made her extremely happy.
I'm ashamed to think
she believed in my love
I thought your in-law was a mechanic
It's no reason to sleep
between 2 pumps
He lives here.
The garage is in town.
Hurry, we're late.
Something we forgot
concerning your sister.
Wouldn't it be better
if I stayed at a hotel?
Don't worry.
She knows me.
That's good to hear.
Idiot
Little sis who lives and works in Paris...
...isn't a nun in a convent.
Besides, she doesn't care.
And if you're shy,
there are 15 rooms in this dump
How are you?
- Hi Madame. Marc Andrieux.
- Jeanne
I'll show you your rooms.
You'll have yours and Marc,
in the small one adjoining.
Here's your room.
I hope you'll like it.
Yes, I like it a lot.
Yes, very much
I'll leave you.
Friends are over for dinner.
Paul is coming soon.
Ok, I'll just change
and I'll catch up, thank you.
I never saw anything so crappy.
Come I'll introduce you.
Philip, my son.
Stop now.
Your father'll be home
Mrs Decourt, my mother-in-law.
Jacques Ferrand, Paul's partner.
And his wife Anna.
- What can I get you?
- Please, Porto, Whisky?
Nice city, Quimper
A bit too calm.
Specially in winter.
In summer, it's okay.
But it's better in spring.
The conditions are very pleasant
The fields are covered with flowers.
Only in the spring does
It happen so often
Autumn, too, is charming here.
When I came here last fall
there were shades
Of yellows, reds and
Golden light
Yes, and blues. Beautiful.
You live in Paris?
It's more lively than here.
Yes, a little too much for my taste.
We were there three weeks ago.
The traffic is becoming impossible.
Yes, specially at rush hour.
From Madelaine to Porte Maillot,
two hours. It's crazy no?
And the noise is godawful!
I've read
in a police report it could reach
I don't know how many decibels
between 6 and 8 pm.
And the pollution is nasty.
It appears to be a real
national problem.
And even international.
Who knows how it's all gonna end?
Yes, I see many young people.
They're distressed.
Did you have a nice summer?
- Are you kidding?
- Lousy!
All the tourists ran away to Spain.
It was catastrophic
And that wasn't because
of the weather.
The sun shines here too.
Believe me the Authorities
are largely responsible.
All polical advertisement
needs to be reviewed.
I don't know what your calling is, sir?
I write a little.
Oh of course!
Remind me your name?
I read your last novel.
What was it called?
I loved the end.
When the old maid runs to open...
No, I write fairy tales for children.
Wonderful!
Another drink?
No, thank you.
Although it's very good
15 years of age.
If I may, what do you think
of the new novels?
It bores some people.
But I find It's an interesting
attempt to renew the form.
It reconciles time and space.
- Don't you find?
- Yes... sure
Nathalie Sarraute,
Butor, Robbe-Grillet
one may like them or not
and it goes far.
Yes, very far.
Indeed.
I think so too.
Here's Paul.
Hey bitch,
it's a nice cushy life isn't it?
Because we've been too nice to you...
...you take it easy.
But you're not there, far from it
Don't laugh.
You'd better not.
It's not my hand
you're gonna feel, it's my foot.
And it's gonna hurt.
You dumb-bell!
Already here?
Sorry I'm late, I had a meeting
Why the long faces?
This stew is simply disgusting.
The sauce is watery.
Why didn't you time it?
It boiled for 4 hours.
5 or 6, I don't care!
I've told you before, when the meat's
cooked, keep it warm
And the sauce,
you cook separately in a pan
Separately, in a pan.
Haven't I said it. Separately
You a gourmet?
Yes, on my time
So you understand me.
They always do what they can
to make me complain.
And I hate wasting merchandise
Imagine what I pay
per month for meat only
100,000 francs
Cooking is the only art
which doesn't lie.
You can fuck up on paintings, music
but cooking is no trifle,
it's either good or bad.
Only, my wife prefers
to lock herself in her room...
...to write her trash.
So in the morning I, clic!
Don't miss a good opportunity.
"O moon of hope, valley of tears"
"my heart under the bodice black"
Paul, please... stop!
"Souls of the gods, elixir of the
world's youth"
"To great works in the spring
of all things"
That's not bad.
"Dances of my heart on the mauve..."
Wait...
What is it?
"Dances of my heart on the
mauve asphodels"
"While a last revolt from black Erebus"
"Jogs the very seat of my ego."
She locks herself in her room
to shake her seat.
What do you think of that?
Madame, it fully justifies
abandoning your duties.
You're very kind,
but Paul is only teasing me.
You know I like you, sweet peach!
I've nothing against poetry.
I'm all for culture
you shit, can't you be more careful?
See what you made me do, asshole.
Get out of here!
You hear me? Get out!
A monstrous being
a caricature of a perfectly evil man
such as one hopes
never to meet in life
I feared I'd find a friendly guy
Now my joy to eliminate, it will be.
You said you'd like to visit
my garage?
Yes, with pleasure.
What are you writing, a book?
I'd have liked to do that.
It's an easy job
and brings in dough. What?
You don't want me to read it?
Not really...
...I don't like to show it.
Why because it's dirty?
No, not at all.
It's a question of,
I don't know... how it'll end
It's the story of a man
looking for another
A detective story?
Yes, in a way, yes.
I thought you wrote stuff for kids.
Well, yes.
It's a story about a child.
Are you afraid of thieves?
Do you always hide it like that?
Sorry, it's a matter of talking,
I don't like...
I can lend you the key to my safe
if you fear inquisiters.
I know what it means
to keep precious things.
We could dig a hole
and put a slab over it
If your kids book is so important.
That's lousy!
It's for the runs.
I hope you never have one like it.
Surprised?
It's huge.
Mr Andrieux, what a pleasure!
He asked to visit the garage.
Can't think why.
Everything interests a writer.
He may be looking for a new setting
In dirty oil and grease?
I know him. He does it out of politeness
Everything interests him.
Workers disturbed make your bill major
You understand chics?
She wants to paint.
I hire a professor, wonderful guy
who taught in colleges.
One week later, painting's out
She stays in her room
reading spiritual junk...
...horoscopes, Zen, Hinduism
Buddhism, Brahma, Shiva,
whatever else
Now she takes to writing poetry.
I'm just worried the boy
will turn out like her.
Perhaps she's trying to escape.
I work myself to death
so she's got everything!
That's in the family.
Helen's the same.
She could cry about a lot shit...
specially to me.
I could tell you about it
'til dooms day.
But I'm not here to confide.
What are you doing
digging around in that filth.
What are you handling this trash for?
Nothing... nothing.
You know a sculptor named Ceasar?
He adores car-bodies.
He says there's a soul in each shape
He says that?
Aren't you a bit loopy too?
Splendid soul!
Why do car sellers
always kick the tires?
Why do movie makers
always do this?
It's a trade habit.
I kick the wheels
If you want a car,
that's an exceptional ride.
Thanks, I've got one.
Not like this one.
I don't say that because
I own the garage.
This one was mine.
A good old car.
I have to get rid of it.
Why?
Why do you have to get rid of it?
I'm not asking
if your grandmother rides a bike?
Why the hell are you doing here?
Don't hurry, we're just waiting!
- I looked for you everywhere
- What for
You have to sign my note-book.
What do you have in History?
The cards were against me
I studied the Directory,
but we got the Empire
- Leave me alone!
- That's enough!
Okay, we're not gonna fight
about bullshit
After all, we're brothers-in-law!
You're almost
a member of the family.
Not quite.
Phillip!
He's a jerk, a lousy pig!
I hope he croaks!
He's your father.
I don't care!
Why don't you kill him?
Why don't you kill him?
What you're asking is crazy!
Do you realize that?
Yes. I can tell what
you were thinking.
If you don't do it, I will.
What will you do?
I will do it.
I got one twice as big!
What a charming family scene!
Think so?
Look, Phillip!
Oh beautiful children,
a spider crab!
I told you to show your skin, bitch!
- I'm cold.
- I'll warm you up
What about Jeanne?
She doesn't care.
And Anna's husband?
He doesn't care either.
I adore you!
No, Paul, not now!
Come and see!
Look!
What is it? Why are you
looking at me like that?
You slept with him too?
Who "him"?
You know very well who I mean
It's my most shameful memory.
You forgive me?
I've nothing to forgive you for.
Are you hiding anything else?
Isn't that enough?
You're sure you're not hiding
something else?
Marc, have pity on me!
What I confessed today
is already too much.
Look, Jeanne, this ordinary shellfish
is a wild marine gastropod
with an extraordinary strength.
Come on you hunters,
it's high tide, let's go home.
They say it's hard to roast
country plums here.
I'll put you up
for a good bargain if you like.
I'm no businessman
Don't be silly!
You'd get 2 million for a capital of 10.
It means 20%/0.
You don't give that away
An old girl owns this land,
3 miles from here.
I wanna turn it into a golf course,
but she won't sell it.
We could easily ruin her.
And I'd have the land for nothing if.
She entrusted me with bonds,
there's no proof. No receipt
I'm talking seriously.
Want to see that land?
It's not far.
Shake a leg, you lazybones!
Look, look at that!
Help!
I can't hold on!
I'm going to break my neck...
Help!
You can't let me fall...
Help!
Do something!
What happened?
Lay off!
Let's go!
I'm fed up of your bloody fishing!
Turn it on.
Why did you help him?
Who?
You should've let him smash
on the rocks.
Quiet.
He doesn't deserve to live.
I know.
I don't like him either.
Lovers often hesitate,
not out of shyness
but to prolong
their awaiting happiness.
I, full of hatred
am savouring what awaits me.
His killing will only be a gesture
of a man throwing
away the useless peel
of a fruit slowly enjoyed to the pit.
He can't swim.
His son told me.
I spend hours walking with Phillip.
I must convince
Decourt to go boating.
I'll rent a very small boat.
I'll wait for the day
with a southwest wind.
We'll sail before the wind,
up to the cape.
From there,
we'll go against the wind.
Then the time will have come.
I'll wait for a strong squall
to put the helm hard over
then we'll stall
and the boat will capsize.
Infallibly.
Generally, they don't rent.
They make 'em per order.
The boss is a friend of mine,
he'll do us a favor
I could buy one if necessary
Just for one outing?
You're extravagant!
He's never in, that dope!
This one isn't bad.
Not bad at all.
A mere cockle-shell!
Don't count on me
to accompany you in it!
- Why are you scared?
- No, but I love life
There's ten times more risk
crossing the street.
- Like it, Charles?
- Oh sure
You're calling me Charles now
We know each other pretty well.
No?
And I hate standing on ceremony.
I might be a bit harsh,
but it's because I'm up front.
But honestly, spending 3
or 4 millions on this is just stupid.
No, it's not stupid.
So what do you think?
I don't give a damn!
Most people prefer the Odyssey.
But the Iliad is the most sublime
ever written.
Later on, when you read Kafka,
you'll see it's similar
But Homer is much better
There's a town...
which is mentioned
And no one ever enters
Hundreds and hundreds of young
heroes fight and die
for that inaccessible and unreal thing.
It's a very simple story
but with remarkable poetical details.
When a bad poet describes death,
he automatically uses cliches.
He writes about eyes frowning
at the sweat beading on the forehead
Of the ghastly inhuman grin
There's none of that in Homer.
Every death he describes is particular
Real even
I remember a part where a young Trojan,
chased by Dionysus
receives the javelin
in the nape of his neck
The point comes out through his mouth
like a tongue of metal.
And he rolls around on the ground
biting the cold steel.
Beautiful no?
You're very kind...
...to help me. I was lost with those
Greeks and Trojans
It embarrasses me to tell you
but I like you very much.
I'm embarrassed from you telling me
but I'm happy to hear it
Too bad you're not
Not what?
That you're not my father.
You think it's bad
to judge one's parents?
You know
In truth it's rather difficult not to.
But you're better of think
about something else.
Then ignore them?
Is that right?
Yes, that's about right.
I would have rather liked
having a father to think about.
That too is hard to prevent
thinking
I think of him and I'm mortified.
I know how children are made.
Half of my blood flowing in my veins,
my skin, my hair, my eyes
Shut up!
Anyway, your blood is your blood.
It's yours
Your eyes are yours.
You see, you look,
you think, you act, you...
All right, go on.
Tomorrow 's sunday.
Will you take me boating?
No.
I invited your father in fact.
He hates it.
He has the jitters.
He wasn't pleased
the other day on the cliff.
For having been...
scared in front of everyone.
Why did you invite him?
Why?
Because he... introduced me to...
the man who sold me the boat.
Thanks to him, I got a bargain.
So it's
it's the least I could do.
Come on.
Back to work!
I have a errand to do.
II'll be back in 15.
Don't delay too much,
the tide is rising.
Put on oilskins.
Don't want you to catch cold.
I'll dress like a sea lion.
Be careful, Marc.
Paul isn't exactly a sailor.
I'm not a baby!
- You've always hated water.
- Except with Pastis
Come on, slow coach!
I just heard the weather-report.
It isn't great
No but there's only a little wind
a little rain toward the Cape.
Otherwise it's very nice and calm
- Be careful my dear.
- Yes, don't worry
- Don't sail too far.
- No I better not in all case
What do you mean you better not?
All right, go on.
Say, don't you think
it's getting a little choppy?
No, on the contrary,
the sea is perfect.
- Where are we going?
- Right to the cape and back
The Cape! You're crazy,
it's full of stones and terrible currents.
Don't be afraid.
God damn it.
Stop saying that, I'm not afraid!
Only, I don't like being stupid.
That's all.
I'm here.
Are you all right?
Want to hold the helm?
No, I know nothing about it.
Easy. You go right, you go left.
Let it go when there's wind
The sail inflates and holds.
You scared?
Stop bugging me!
I'm not a kid, I just don't like it.
Okay, then try.
Why come on a boat
if you don't try?
Let me pass.
You see, it's not voodoo.
It isn't that difficult.
Yes, it's easy.
Why do they make such a fuss of it!
I told you
What do I do now?
Ease off
Let it ease off!
Let it.
I'm fed up.
Take this shit back.
Duck!
Let go.
Don't pull on it
Enough with your helm!
Take it back.
- Let go! Let go
- It's gonna come off
Just let it go.
The joke's over.
Now we go back.
No, the fun's just beginning.
We're going back!
What's going on?
Are you mad?
Don't try any nasty tricks or else!
We'll croak together buddy
What trick?
Don't argue.
Do as I say.
You should've hidden
your diary better.
Poor dope, you think I'm that stupid?
Because you write kids' tales,
you think everyone else is a nitwit?
When I saw the fuss you made...
...first thing I did
was read your filthy diary.
I'll have an accident
if you're not careful.
You'd better not.
Because your diary
is at my lawyer's now.
If anything happens to me,
your little black book
will go right to the Police.
That was my little errand,
back there. I was crackin' up.
You think I'm a jerk?
Why didn't you go
straight to the Police?
Because you knew...
...you'd spend years in jail?
Don't worry, I won't denounce you.
On the contrary!
I want to get your skin...
your bastard skin... and I'll get it.
It's as good as done
and you can do nothing.
I won't be worried in the least.
You're as good as dead
Fuck you, you bastard!
Dirt bag! Lousy bum!
Rotten swine!
Fuck you, d'you hear!
Fuck you... you shit!
Rotten, disgraceful,
trash, trash, trash!
Never set foot in my house again!
Got me Mr. Artist?
And if I find you
I'll throw you out the window!
I'll just take my bag.
Ask your bitch to do it for you!
Are you cold?
Shall I close it?
No, it's not worth it
Anyway, we'll stop soon.
We'll pig out.
You want to pig out?
More than ever!
Here, try this.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing.
I don't want to think.
I wonder how you can eat.
You know,
I too am trying not to think.
Until now,
it hasn't spoiled my appetite.
On the contrary!
May I serve the duck?
Yes, please.
You know
the young boy
the one you ran over on the road
he was my son.
It took me a long time to find you.
And my real name is Charles Thenier.
You can imagine, when you ask me
to accompany you to Brittany
my only aim was
to meet Paul and kill him.
That's not why we met?
At first, it was.
You can't imagine what I've endured.
You may not believe me, but
I didn't dare talk.
I'm a coward
I don't love myself.
You've already told me that.
Let's go back there.
You'll kill him?
I'll help you.
Now some sad news:
The violent death
Listen.
Of a well-known person,
Paul Decourt
whose body was found
in his bathroom.
The death seems due to poisoning.
The point in question is,
an accident or a suicide.
Mr. Decourt was
a well-known garage owner
brother in-law
of an actress
whom we often see on our screens:
Helen Lanson.
Miss Lanson was, in fact,
visiting soon before the tragedy
together with the writer,
Marc Andrieux
the best-selling author
for the young.
We presume they're both
on the road to Paris.
If they are listening,
please come back at once?
And now, here are the first pictures
of the family drama
A cruel rictus.
Something really horrid to see.
It's him.
He killed him!
Please sit down, Madame.
I'm Superintendent Constant.
How do you do, Charles Thenier
You see, he introduced himself
under a false name.
You understand?
Please, Madame,
you'll speak in your turn
Swine!
What happened exactly?
The maid discovered the body
around 7 p.m.
In other words,
shortly after you left, I guess
Yes, that's right.
He'd dragged himself
and collapsed on the basin
breaking it in his fall.
How sad!
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.
We have the postmortem results.
It might interest you.
Let me have a drink.
You know he used to take
a medicine for his intestines?
I had hardly arrived, I'd been
here one or two days...
when he kindly informed me.
Some was found in his stomach
together with poison.
There was nothing else.
What sort of poison?
A compound containing
arsenious acids.
It's used to destroy vermin.
It's commonly named "rat poison".
It causes atrocious agony.
The nerve centres are paralysed.
One hour before death,
the body lurches...
as in epilepsy.
Breathing becomes impossible.
Paul Decourt suffered abominably.
I'm dreadfully sorry,
Superintendent!
Unfortunately
rat poison has an awful taste.
Poisoners can't put it
into soup or tea.
But it escapes notice
in bitter medicine.
Therefore it's not impossible
that it was put into the bottle.
Don't listen to that bastard!
Please, Madame, keep quiet!
But the bottle has vanished.
No clues, no prints, nothing.
Any ideas, Mr Thenier?
None.
Why should I have?
Of course.
And now, let's talk about
your... diary.
Of course we have it.
And of course I read it.
I hope you
admired the quality of my style!
Among other things, yes.
I understand your motives.
We're not monsters
but I represent the Law.
That diary constitutes
overwhelming evidence against you.
Really?
How?
You write at length
that your aim is to kill
Paul Decourt.
Planning a crime
- isn't a crime.
- You want him dead, that's obvious.
That isn't a crime either.
Yes, I admit it.
I admit I wanted to kill him.
I also admit that the news
you give me
makes me very happy
and I regret only one thing
that he suffered so little.
For I have suffered since January
At least you're honest
But it makes you more of a suspect.
Perhaps.
But I didn't kill him!
Anyway, everybody
wanted him dead.
Everybody hated him!
Don't exaggerate.
Except his mother, maybe
because she's like him.
I'd go even further:
You should take me
off your list of suspects.
I knew he had my diary
and would have it taken to the
Police if anything happened to him.
I'm not fool enough
to kill him and put my head...
in the lion's mouth!
Yes, of course.
I've thought about that, you know.
I'll examine these people.
Especially Miss Lanson.
And then we'll continue
this interview, Mr Thenier.
Take Mr Thenier to my office.
Go down to the hotel
next door and I'll join.
Bastard!
A cow
in two letters?
I... O.
Yes, "I... O".
Come along, Mr Thenier.
Sit down.
I saw everybody and
I've come to some conclusions.
You would be most foolish to kill
when everything is against you.
But you're the opposite of a fool.
A man like you
couldn't have killed Paul Decourt.
Unless
unless he plays the part of an idiot.
I'm listening.
Go on.
Suppose you decide
to arouse Decourt's suspicion
on purpose.
You excite his curiosity.
You plan for him to find your diary.
You incite him to take precautions
and these precautions
will destroy him.
He's sure that the threatening charges
will stop you killing him.
That's a mistake
The opposite happens.
But that's only a supposition.
Let me go on:
If one considers your diary
as a confession made
to yourself, you're quite right.
It puts you last on the list.
But let's suppose it's the main part
the prime motive in your plan.
What do you say?
Nothing.
I'm listening.
Mr Thenier, I think your diary
was written only to be discovered.
It was.
Then there was no obstacle
to the killing of Decourt.
But I don't understand you there.
It was easier to do it
under my false name.
We'd have found out soon enough.
Whereas if you didn't hide
if you acted in full daylight
you cut the ground from
under our feet, right?
I'm afraid I have to
put you under arrest.
Now tell me frankly:
Where's the bottle?
Young Philip Decourt wishes to see you.
He says it's important.
Bring him in.
Come, Philip, don't be afraid.
What is it?
You've something to tell me?
I'm bringing this.
It contains the poison.
I'd hidden it in the cellar.
I killed dad.
You realize what you're saying?
Yes.
It's me.
Marc didn't do anything.
Father was cruel and vile.
I found rat poison in the garage.
I poured it into his medicine.
Dad drank it, then put it
back in the cupboard.
Later, I took the bottle back.
And I hid it
in case my finger prints showed.
You swear this is true?
I do.
Look at me, Philip.
You swear it's true?
Your life is ruined.
Do you realize that?
Well?
Don't talk about it now.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow I'll tell you
the whole story.
Now I want to sleep.
I want to sleep
Helen, my darling
forgive me.
Last night, Philip accused
himself of cold blood murder.
I said nothing.
And I left the Police Station freely.
What a fine revenge, wasn't it?
Worthy of a Greek drama!
A man kills a child
and that man's son kills him.
Poor Philip!
He had a merciless hatred of
his father, almost equal to mine.
Perhaps his friendship for me
was born of that common feeling.
I could have suggested to him
what he should do
to kill his father.
I am sure nothing could
have stopped him.
Maybe he would have loved
me better still.
Tell the Superintendent
that the boy lied...
that I am guilty.
I, and I alone.
Philip lied only to save me.
Understand, I hated
that abject man so much...
that I refused to ruin
my life for him.
The Superintendent guessed right:
My diary hinted that
I missed my revenge...
while I was preparing it.
Forgive me.
I cannot let Philip pay for me.
Yet I thought I had become
as cold as steel.
But it takes a long time
for a heart to die.
Philip mustn't get into trouble.
Helen, if we had not been
carried away by this...
I would have loved you!
Now I am going to set sail.
I will go far and never return.
I will disappear Helen,
erase myself
I acted like a coward, yesterday.
The prison scared me.
And I accepted Philip's sacrifice.
I shall choose my own punishment.
Brahms wrote a song
paraphrasing Ecclesiastes.
It says: "The Beast must die."
"But the Man too."
"One and the other must die"
Farewell.
