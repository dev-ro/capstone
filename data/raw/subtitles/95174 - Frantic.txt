Nice fruits.
Yeah, well,

Nice view.

from the Eiffel Tower this afternoon...
...where you and Dr. Alembert

But first, let me have the notes
so that l can confirm your iuncheon.

You can't speak French and

Richard, give me that. Listen...
Richard, don't sWallow it.
You're gonna choke.
Now she says...
Well, at least iet me get you
some water to wash it down.
Honey, Maurice Aiembert
doesn't give a rat's ass about me.
NoW, since he saw you
at the Berkeley seminar last year:
"Oui, your lovely wife.
Make sure to bring her to Paris. "
Was he the one with the long legs
who took his shoes off when he spoke?
Never mind.
How do you feel?
Do you want some breakfast?
l've already eaten, thanks.
l'm gonna order some cafe au iait
and croissants. You want some?
Yes.
Hello. Room service?
Uh... Over here, please.

Got it.
Walkers' residence.
- Hey, buddy.

- lt's 11 :00 at night, Richard.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing up?
You woke me up.
- l knoW. Just testing.
- Sure, Dad.
Before that, somebody else called
from Paris for Mom.
Somebody called for you from Paris.
- Wha...?
- l don't know anybody in Paris.
Hold on a second.
- Mom wants to say hello.
- All right.
Would you make these keys work?
l can't get my suitcase open.
- Hi.

- l'm all right.
- Are you sleeping?
- Yeah.
Who called me?

- Him? Would you put Casey on?
She's not here.
She left you alone?
- Casey's out?
- Yeah, she's out on a date.
- When did she go out?
- l don't knoW. She probably left around...
You're not scared, are you?
- No.
- No. You got that number?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you have our number?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well, you can call us anytime, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- We'll call you tomorrow?
- All right.
- Sweet dreams, my love.
- Good night, Mom.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
No wonder you can't get the keys to work.
- lt's not your suitcase.
- What do you mean, it's not my suitcase?
l mean it's not your suitcase. lt doesn't
have your nametag. There's no name at all.
The keys don't work.
lt's not your suitcase, dummy.
Walker, you did this on purpose because
you want me to go shopping in Paris.
- Au contraire, my dear.
- Oh, no?
No, no, no. l'll get on TWA right away
and get it straightened out. Heh.
Yes, please. Would you get me TWA?
Besides...
The lost luggage department, piease.
Besides, for the next 24 hours...
...you're not gonna need anything to wear.
Promises, promises.
TWA, bonjour.
Yes, please, l was on Flight 862
this morning from San Francisco.
Eight-six-two, yes.
And my wife, apparently,
picked up the wrong bag.
- Samsonite?
- Yes, Samsonite. You have it?
Oh, we have to look, but it's
always Samsonite. They look alike.
- What. S your tag number?
- The tag number is...
- Hoid on a second, please.
- Okay.
The Grand Hotel lntercontinental.
Richard Walker.
So how about it?
They're gonna send somebody
to pick this one up...
...and then we gotta
fill out a form for yours.
And then we gotta hope
that whoever's got your stuff...
...doesn't like it better than their own.
l was talking about breakfast in bed.
Be with you in a minute.
Walker!
Honey, l can't hear you.
You're awful quiet in there, babe.
Haven't gone to sleep on me, have you?
l ain't in here shaving for drill.
You gonna get that, babe?
Where...?
Come in.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- This is your les affaires de toilette.
- Yes, certainly.
- Yeah, l can get that?
Can they fix a special dinner
for mademoiselle?
Yes.
l'm looking for my wife.
Where's the guy who was here
this morning?
Good-looking guy, was here this morning
when l checked in.
He stops work at 8.
Perhaps l can help you.
ls the manager in? l'd like to speak to him.
Would you get him for me, piease?
Certainly, sir. lf you please.
Monsieur Walker.
- Yes.
- You wish to see me?
Yes, thank you.
- l checked in this morning with my wife.
- Yes.
- While l was in the shoWer, she left.
- Yes.
- And she hasn't come back.
- Well, how may l help you?
- Does she know Paris?
- Beg your pardon.
- Maybe she's lost.
- No, no, no. She wouldn't have gone out.
She ieft her bag
and she would have told me.
- Ah.
- lt's for me?
Thank you. Hello?
Yes. Dr. Walker?
Yes?
Hello, Dr. Janet Perelman.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
- Yes, thank you.
- Dr. Alembert asked me to call.
We have a slight scheduling problem.
Aortic valves seem to be
a particularly temperamental group.
We wonder if you'd mind moving up,
reading your paper tomorrow at 3?
- No, no problem.
- Oh, good.
- We'll get your slides in the morning.
- Right. Yes.
And about the lunch at the Eiffel Tower...
...would you like us to pick you up
or can you get there on your own?
l'm afraid we're gonna have to cancel.
- Oh, what a pity.
- l'm sorry.
lt sounds like a tourist trap...
...but it's not. The food is marvelous.
- No. That's not it.
lt's unavoidable, l'm afraid.
Well, Dr. Alembert was hoping to see you
and your wife before the madness starts.
- l'll have him call you back today.
- Yes, thank you.
Well?
- No, it was something else.
- This is Pascal, our head of security.
Does your wife know anybody
in the hotel?
- Not that l know of.
- Have you checked with the concierge?
- He may have seen something.
- He's off duty. lt was Gai...
- Gaillard.
- Gaillard.
- Why don't we try to give him a ring?
- Oh, please.
ls your wife diabetic or...?
l'm a doctor. lt's not a medical probiem.
He says his father is sleeping.
He's not supposed to wake him.
We'll call back later.
Have you checked around the hotel?
Yes. l looked in the neWspaper place,
the bar, outside, everywhere.
How about the ladies' room?
No.
Well, cleariy, she's not here.
Wait.
Just a second, please.
Excuse me, l'm looking for this lady.
l'm looking... l think she might...
Um... l'm looking for my wife.
l'm... My wife. She might have...
Espresso, please.
Excuse me, you speak Engiish?
My wife.
Yeah, what do you want?
l'm looking for my wife, this one here.
l was wondering if she might have
come in this morning.
She had no coat.
She was wearing a red dress.
A lot of people come here,
you knoW. Sorry.
Over there, this morning, in the passage.
A man put a woman in the car.
This woman?
Coming. Coming with me.
l explain to you.
Please.
l'm sorry. How much?
- Five.
- All right. Thank you.
- Twelve.
- Twelve.
Yes, it is true.
lncredible story.
Exactly, exactly.
They saw everything.
They saw what? What did they see?
One man push with brutality
the poor woman in the car.
- When? When?
- They go back later, you know?
Do you have a cigarette?
l don't smoke, but...
...that should be enough.
Eyes?
Blue. Blue-gray, really.
Face?
- What about it?
- The shape.
lt's thin and narrow at the jaw,
with a rounded forehead.
- Paris.
- City of Lights. Ha-ha.
Listen, listen. l expect you people
to take me seriously, you know?
You are being taken
perfectly seriously here, sir.
As a matter of fact,
you have a special treatment.
Usually we fill out this form
after a week or so.
Usually we just take a deposition.
SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
Okay? This is the procedure.
Photo.
You see, the thing is,
even if they find Mrs. Walker...
...they cannot disclose her whereabouts
without her consent.
Unless you get the attorney
to make a formal request.
What are you talking about?
Why wouldn't my wife
want me to know where she's at?
You and your wife
have been to Paris before?
Yes, on our honeymoon.
ls it possible she met someone then,
someone she has been thinking about?
Since June 1 5, 1 968?
Please, don't take offense.
l'm an ex-cop.
- We've seen this type of thing before.
- Can we call the concierge again...
...see if he's awake?
- lt's his wife. Gaillard's gone out.
- Where?
Gym Tonic?
- Gin and Tonic? A bar?
- Gym Tonic. A gymnasium.
Did you get an address?
Gym Tonic.
- They don't take calls for customers.
- Tell them it's an emergency.
They hung up.
- lt's Walker. Dr. Walker.
- 402.
- That's right.
- ls there something l can do for you, sir?
- Yes. My wife, do you remember my wife?
- Yes.
She ieft the hotel this morning
while you were on duty, l think.
- Did you see her?
- Yes, l spoke to her.
What did she say?
She asked me to send up
some toilet articles...
...and then she ieft with the man
who had called her.
- l don't understand. The man who...
- Well, a man...
...asked me if Mrs. Walker
was staying at the hotel.
l said she was. So he called your room.
Then, a few minutes later,
your wife came down...
...she asked me to get her
some toothpaste, a toothbrush and...
How do you call to take off makeup?
Take makeup off your face. lt's...
- Cotton balls.
- Cotton balls.
And they left together.
ls there some probiem?
Did she seem to know him?
Were they talking together?
Did you notice anything else?
l noticed she had wet hair,
which is a bit strange.
l didn't really hear
what they were saying but...
...he had his arm around her.
- Around her waist or...?
- No, around her shoulder.
What...? What did he iook like, this man?
Tall, well-dressed, mustache, dark skin.
He had an accent.
- An accent?
- Not American, if you know what l mean.
More like Middle East.
- Thank you very much for your help.
- No, no. Dr. Walker. No, no.
l'm sorry. Thank you very much.
l'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to wait your turn.
- But this is an emergency, you understand?
- Yes, sir.
You understand,
but don't give a damn, is that it?
l'm sorry, sir. We have a iot of emergencies.
You have to wait like everyone else.
Has everyone eise had
their wife kidnapped?
l don't knoW, sir.
Where you from, sir?
San Francisco,
just like it says on the passport.
Can you step through
the metai detector, please?
Here, l'll take that, sir.
Wanna step back through and remove
all the metal objects from your pockets.
- l keep your passport.
- Thank you.
You're supposed to wear this pass
in the building, sir.
Thank you. Go in.
Eyes?
Blue, both of them.
Blue.
- Face?
- Oval. Look...
l know this must seem like
annoying bureaucracy, but really...
...we have to get one of these to the police
when we deal with a missing person.
l've already been to the police.
l filled out one of these damn forms.
And it's not a missing person.
lt's a kidnapping.
Don't you think that's a bit premature
to be so positive?
No, l don't think. l have witnesses.
My wife was kidnapped.
- Do you understand what l'm saying to you?
- Yes. Yes, of course.
But what would you like us
to do, exactly?
l want you to find my wife.
Well, you understand, Dr. Walker,
ours is basically a liaison function.
We can assist you in communicating
with the French police.
We can put pressure on the Ministry
of lnterior. But this is their country.
lt's theirjurisdiction.
We can't just send a posse out after her.
What do you do here?
l'm head ofAmerican Services.
Visa applications...
...registering births, any kind of general...
- ls there somebody here who can help me?
Why don't you have a word
with our security officer?
- Are you rich?
- No. Well, l'm well-off. l'm a surgeon.
- You involved in politics?
- No.
What about your wife?
The same.
We don't even vote anymore, l'm afraid.
There doesn't seem to be much
to support your kidnapping theory.
This is your only evidence?
She could have just dropped it.
lt's a bit flimsy, doesn't close very well.
lt used to.
You were in the shower
when this person called?
Yes.
So you didn't actually hear
any of their conversation?
No, none of it.
They spoke for a moment and then
she went downstairs to meet him.
Meet him?
Yes, meet him.
And when they left the hotel,
he had his arm around her.
- Dr. Walker.
- He had his arm around her.
Here, like this.
He could have had a gun. Like this.
Here. Pointed right at her.
"Shut up. Smile. Walk. Out the lobby. "
Like this, huh?
Yes. Yes, it couid mean that. Or they
could've just been having a good time.
Mr. Shaap, you're talking about my wife.
You must be thinking about yours.
402, please.
What's this?
Jesus, the suitcase.
- No other messages?
- No, sir.
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
He asked if you could leave it
in the luggage room.
Yeah. Can l have my key, please?
lt's not here, Mr. Walker.
Yes.
Just a minute, please.
Thank you. And this.
Please call Dr. Richard Waiker
at the Grand Hotel lntercontinental.
lt's important.
- Beer.
- Tuborg, Heineken?
Yes.
Dede?
You're looking for Dede, man?
Yeah, you know him?
Yeah, man.
You don't look like you know him.
- What am l supposed to look like?
- Desperate, man.
Yeah, well, l'm desperate.
Ha-ha. So where you from, man? New York?
- San Francisco.

Many places to dance.
Come on, man. Buy me a Kahlua and

Well, all l really need, man, is Dede.
All the boys and girls
are iooking for Dede these days.
But Dede's been gone,
you knoW, two nights.
Yeah, but where?
Man, why not say what you're looking for?
Dede not the only one
who can show you.
Why don't you tell me
what l'm looking for?
The white lady.
NoW, isn't that so?
- Yes.
- Heavy. Now l see the desperate man.
- ls she all right?
- Beautiful, man.
Nobody has touched the iady.
You don't worry, man.
Follow me.
- Where is she?
- Cool, man.
No one has so much
as stepped on her toe.
She's here, man.
And pure as the driven snoW.
- Hey. No, look.
- Come on, man, give it a try.
Do a one-on-one and tell me if l lie.
Come noW, man. The nose knoWs.
The white lady.
Pure white.
Good, not true?
Six hundred franc.
You don't need Dede, man.
No.
Dollars?
- All right, man.
- NoW, look.
One more of these
for Dede's address, huh?
Okay.
You have a stylo, man?
Do you have a pen?
Your matches.
Hello?
Jesus.
Please call
Dr. Richard Walker, Grand Hotel...
No messages, huh?
Nothing here.
Let me check with the operator.
Thank you.
Why don't you go to the gym
and do some sports, Dr. Walker?
There were a couple of calls for you,
but the man wouldn't leave a message.
Son of a bitch.
Would you come to my room
for a moment?
Very well.
- The suitcase.
- l'll call the police.
No, no, no.
Not now.
l left a suitcase in the luggage room.
Would you get it for me?
- lt's gone. They took it.
- What? Who?
TWA. Just after l came on duty.
Shut the door.
l want you to tell me what this says.
"lt's me. lt's Michelle.
l'm back. l've made a good trip.
l'll see you tonight at the Biue Parrot.
Don't forget my money. l kiss you. "
She's waiting for Dede.
Something about her leaving a suitcase
in some locker.
She's got nothing to dress in and no keys.
lt's her again.
She's angry noW.
She'll wait at the Parrot until it closes,
then she'll go to his place.
- What time do nightclubs close?
- Four or 6, it depends.
Dede?
Pardon. Listen, listen!
Listen.
Where is she?
- Please don't kill me!
- You tell me, where is she?
- Who? What do you want?
- My wife.

So you have it. Then pay me

No, l don't what you mean.
All l know is that l have your suitcase...

You put my wife's suitcase in the locker

And when l will be back,
he will give me at least...
- How much do they oWe you?
- Ten thousand francs.
Well, 1 0,000... No, not tweive.

Ten thousand francs, more or iess.
What are you doing?
You're in it for the money,
l'm giving you the money.
Then you can leave me the hell alone.
Two thousand dollars,
that's about 11 ,000 francs.
lt's a bit more.
Room service.
l'm sorry for all this, Dr. Walker. The police
would like to ask you some questions.
They won't let us clean that up

Just a moment.

- lnstead of the other half...
...you keep me with you.
- Why?
l'm trusting you with my suitcase.

Promise?
Yes, l promise. Now scoot.

- l beg your pardon.
Please.
She doesn't know anything about this.

Can l have a little consideration here?
Has Paris changed so much, huh?
So, doctor, has anything been taken?
JeWelry, clothing, anything?
- Why?
- Well, you must have some sort of list...
...in order to lodge a complaint.
Well, actually,
l don't wish to lodge a complaint.
Why not?
Well, the fact is,
there's nothing to complain about.
The truth is...
...l tore this place up myself.
My wife and l were having a fight and...
...l was looking for her phone book.
You're right.
She does have a friend in Paris. Heh.
NoW, look, l've got...
l've got an important paper to read
this morning at this medical convention.
l don't want this to get out of hand.
l'm sorry for the trouble.
l know it's been a lot of trouble.
All right, doctor, we understand.
By the way...
...the concierge informs me you asked him
to translate a tape with messages on it.
He mentioned a name, Dede.
l was told that tape had important medical
information relating to the convention.
You wouldn't have that tape with you?
No.
Well, doctor, it may interest you to know
that my colleagues...
...have come across a man
called Dede Martin...
...who was in serious need
of medical attention.
lf you should find that tape,
please inform us.
l hope you know what you're doing,
Dr. Walker.
