Where did you find that garbage?
Tell me!
It's disgusting!
You're just like your father.
Tits! That's all he ever cared about!
You think he was a hero, don't you?
I could tell you
a thing or two about him.
I'll kill you if I find this garbage
in the house again.
Get the trash can.
I'm burning it all.
Don't just stand there, stupid!
Come on!
I'll bet the bastard showed it to his son
so he'd grow up to be just like him.
That pig.
I'm sure he's got
more filth in here.
Don't be stupid! Get the trash can!
Hurry up!
- What's in here?
- It's his room.
- My God.
- Whoever did this is completely crazy.
It's terrible.
I've never seen so much blood.
There must be something in here.
It's Mrs. Weldon.
I knew it.
I knew something terrible had happened.
- My God!
- Please escort her.
Don't worry, I'm okay.
Back.
- It was a very big man.
- Timmy.
- Very big!
- Take it easy, Timmy.
Where's his dad?
He died in Europe.
He was in the Air Force.
But he's got an aunt
who lives nearby.
I'll call her and go get her.
It's horrible.
Mom?
Where are you?
Mom, come back!
Are you gonna be a while?
I'll go somewhere else.
Only a moment, miss.
All right.
Just a moment, gentlemen.
The dean will be with you shortly.
Don't worry. We're used to it.
Did you know that girl?
Well, I'm not sure.
This is a very big university
and it's hard to remember all the students.
- Yes, sir?
- Are the gentlemen still there?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, I'll be right out.
Okay.
You must be Bracken.
- Lieutenant Bracken.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Sergeant Holden.
- How do you do, Sergeant?
- How do you do?
- Come in, please.
Grace, hold all my calls, please.
After you.
What a terrible matter.
You guys heard the latest?
They installed a water bed in the gym.
How about that?
You ever slept on a water bed?
The coolest feeling in the world...
is smoking a joint
while having sex in a water bed.
Watch out! There he is.
Watch this.
Professor Brown?
I'm sorry, sir. Can I ask you a question?
Where are the pectoral muscles?
My classmates say
that mine are pretty funny.
I can assure you
there's nothing the matter with yours.
Yes, but where are they?
Here. Right here.
We need be discreet. What happened
was just an unfortunate accident-
That murder is simply horrible.
The police are inside. They think
it was somebody from this university.
I won't ask how you came across
that piece of information.
What makes you think that?
Well, the lieutenant says
it looks like an inside job.
Poor Willard. He found the body.
But they still haven't found the head.
I wonder what the killer
could've done with it.
- You know, I'll bet-
- Are they going to be a while?
I don't know, Professor.
They've been in there for quite some time,
so it can't be long.
But if you prefer to come back later-
Get Professor Brown, Grace.
He's probably in the teachers'lounge.
He's right here, sir.
Should I send him in?
Great. Yes, send him in.
According to our current records,
we have over 2000.
I'm glad you're here, Arthur.
This is Inspector Bracken,
and Sergeant Holden.
Pleased to meet you.
I'd like you to show them around.
When is your next class?
- Tomorrow, actually.
- Tomorrow? Great.
They want to ask you some questions
about that girl, Virginia Palmer.
She was in your class,
if I remember correctly.
Professor Brown is the head
of our anatomy department.
Please, show them anything
they wish to see.
And feel free to come back and see me
if you need anything else.
Now...
I ask that you be discreet.
Imagine what it would mean
for the university...
if all of this became front page news.
Don't worry.
That wouldn't help us either.
We'll be discreet.
I'm sure you'll agree that it must
have been an unfortunate accident.
Although these things
always end up becoming public,
it's important right now
is to gain time.
I've said enough already,
and I've got work to do.
I don't think
I'll be of much help to you.
I don't remember the girl too well.
I've had a lot of students this trimester.
Come on, Arthur.
You're only in charge of one department,
while I'm in charge of the whole campus.
I'm sure you'll do a better job than me.
Gentlemen, you'll have to
excuse me. My apologies.
Professor Brown will show you out.
Thank you, sir.
You've been a great help.
I appreciate it.
Please keep me up to date.
Of course, don't worry about it.
So you didn't know the girl too well?
- Got a light?
- No, I don't.
Any idea what kind of girl she was?
Did she chase boys?
She was very attractive, but I don't
remember her having a boyfriend.
This is my classroom. Come in.
We study comparative anatomy
for its use in anthropology and the like.
A present from one of my students.
I don't know where he found it.
It's the skull of a 16-year-old girl.
I'd like to talk to that kid.
What's his name?
That was a long time ago.
Surely, you don't think
one of our students killed her.
Our job is like identifying garments
which are missing their tags.
We have to check everything.
Did that girl have many friends in her class?
Yes, she was very popular.
If you come to my office, I'll give you
some names that might help you.
Thank you very much, Professor.
We have to start somewhere,
and we don't even have the coroner's report.
All right.
Willard?
Tell me, Willard. When do you think
your work will be done here?
Well, I'm not sure.
Probably in another week or two.
But don't worry.
It won't cost you any more.
That's the deal
I made with your secretary.
- It's all included in the price.
- Yes, it's all included, I know that.
But the sooner you're done, the sooner
you can start work somewhere else.
And I assume
that's in your best interest, isn't it?
- I'll finish as soon as I can.
- Good. All right.
How about a little dip in the pool
by ourselves?
- Hi. How are you?
- Leaving already?
Yes, I have to study.
Brown is real tough.
Look, there he is. He's so weird.
He's always by himself.
So sexy!
- All right, see ya.
- Bye.
Kendall?
- Have you seen Kendall?
- Yeah, he's right there.
Thanks.
By the way, are you free this afternoon?
All right, that's what I was saying.
You're not free.
Kendall, I finally found you.
This is for you.
- What is that?
- How am I supposed to know?
I just know it's urgent.
Where the heck were you?
I've been looking all over campus.
You weren't here before.
Alistair, when did they give you this?
About half an hour ago.
Half an hour? That's weird.
When it comes to keeping a secret,
my lips are sealed.
- Yeah, I know.
- See ya later.
Grab him!
Hold it!
Don't move,
or I'll blow your brains out.
What a tough line of work to be in.
Nobody realizes
just how horrible it is.
Thanks for coming
so quickly, Professor.
Hank? Bring that over here.
I need your help.
I still don't have the coroner's report...
and I need to know right now if this-
this bloodbath-was caused...
by that chainsaw.
Don't touch that!
You might erase some of the prints.
Sorry, I didn't realize that.
I'm not exactly a pathologist, but...
I could almost guarantee
that it was caused by this chainsaw.
Or by something very similar.
All right, Professor.
We'll be in touch. You can go now.
Thank you.
Sergeant, do those kids know
I want to see them?
- Yes, they know.
- Good, let's go talk to the dean.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a feeling.
This case is driving me crazy.
Me too. I've got the strange feeling
that somebody's watching me.
What we really need here
are a couple of undercover officers.
I'll mention it to the dean.
- Women, right?
- Yes, of course.
That's all the killer's interested in.
All right, I'll see ya.
Just a second, kid. And you too.
The lieutenant wants to see you
at the dean's office in half an hour.
All right, I'll make sure
he comes with me.
- Don't worry, we'll be there.
- I hope so, for your sake.
- And not a word of this.
- All right.
Yeah, man. We know.
We're absolutely certain
that person is on campus.
You surely don't think
it's one of my students or teachers.
It could be anybody.
Do you want to cooperate or not?
You want to place
two female officers here to spy on us.
I think you're asking too much.
We've had two murders.
And now that maniac
is going to kill again.
I assure you
it's the only way to catch him.
Yes. Of course.
I understand.
When do you want to start?
I'll let you know.
Now I'd like to ask your secretary
and those two kids some questions.
Don't tell them you couldn't find me
the first time you went to the library.
- You know how cops are.
- You think I'm stupid?
- Where were you?
- With Alice. You know her?
The blond chick? Really? Her too?
- Of course. Nothing to it.
- You're amazing.
- You gotta share that recipe.
- If you behave.
Let's see, if I'm not mistaken...
you found an envelope on your desk...
addressed to Kendall
with the word "urgent" written on it.
Yes, and I gave it
to the dean right away.
Didn't I, sir?
And what did you do?
I'm sorry, but is all this
really necessary, Lieutenant?
Maybe you should ask that
to the parents of the murdered girls.
Yes, I understand.
It's natural.
You see, I instructed Grace,
my secretary...
to send the letter to Kendall urgently.
Urgently? Why?
I can't tolerate my office
being used as a post office.
The students know that...
and they keep bothering Grace
with all their nonsense,
love letters and that sort of thing.
Nevertheless,
when I found the letter on my desk...
I assumed that what it said
on the envelope was true: "Very urgent."
I'm sorry, sir.
I never imagined thatJenny...
would use your office
for something like that.
You're wrong, kid.
It wasn't her. The killer sent that note
to keep you away from the pool.
Why did you go?
I really don't know.
I had a hunch.
I felt something strange.
Something I can't explain, Lieutenant.
Yeah.
What about you? You know anything?
Me? Not a word, I swear.
Okay.
But I don't want you to mention
this conversation to anyone.
- Understood?
- Understood.
Give me a call
when you feel better.
- There's somebody I'd like you to talk to.
- All right.
I don't have any more questions.
What about you?
One, two, three, four.
And one, two, three...
four, five, six, seven...
eight.
All right.
- I'm going to step out for a sec.
- All right.
What's the matter?
You scared me to death.
You came out so suddenly.
Come on.
I want to tell you something.
Come in.
- Hi, Doctor.
- Would you stop calling me that?
I'm a psychologist, not an MD.
- Is this the kid?
- Hey, I don't need a shrink.
Come here.
I'm not a shrink, young man.
And I'm sure you don't need me.
Calm down.
The doctor just wants some information.
- About what?
- My name is Jennings.
I'm a psychologist,
as you've just heard.
It's my job to prepare
a detailed psychological profile...
of the possible killer.
In many cases, his psychological profile
is all we have to go on.
But I don't know anything.
Or do I?
Exactly.
You might know the killer
without being aware of it.
Now, if the lieutenant is kind enough
to carry on with his work...
we'll try to make some sense of things.
All right. I'll see you later, huh?
- Bye.
- Have a seat.
Is he dangerous?
Very.
Good. I'm sick of being bored to hell
in this damn office.
I imagined as much. Find an active girl,
make her fill out forms all day long...
and six months later she'll volunteer
for just about anything.
- Dr. Jennings is done with me.
- It wasn't that bad, was it?
- Hey, aren't you Mary Riggs?
- The one and only.
- Mary Riggs, Kendall James.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've seen almost all your matches.
What's a tennis champ doing here?
It's quite simple. This is my home.
Are you saying you work here?
Of course.
She's the woman I spoke to you about.
She'll be working undercover
at the university.
- She'll be the new tennis teacher.
- That's great!
I really appreciate
your trust in me, Lieutenant.
And yours too, of course.
Kendall, all you have to do...
is keep your eyes peeled...
and stay close to Miss Riggs
in case she needs help.
- All right?
- All right.
He's a good kid,
and he's been through a lot.
We've had a good talk,
and I think we can trust him.
That's just fine.
But why did you tell him about me?
We've hit a dead end.
I don't have anyone to protect you.
I trust him.
I'd trust him with my own life.
And mine too, of course.
I can't see why
you're complaining.
You'll be playing tennis every day,
playing tennis till you're worn out.
- In the mean time, we'll be watching.
- I need to speak to the lieutenant.
I'm really sorry,
but that's impossible right now.
- I have orders. You understand-
- I've been calling all morning.
Let her in.
- What is it?
- I was waiting for you, Lieutenant.
Do you have a minute?
- Who are you? It's okay.
- Sylvia Costa. Boston Globe.
What's going on at the university?
What's going on at the university?
What could possibly be going on?
There are rumors going around
about some strange incidents.
Apparently, there's a maniac on the loose,
or something similar.
Look, miss. Rumors like that
go around every single day of the year.
Yes, but this time
they seem to be true.
There's even talk about a murdered girl.
The students' imagination
knows no bounds.
I'm sorry, but I'm very busy.
Will you excuse me?
But-
Why don't you talk to Miss Riggs?
She's the one that's up to date
on all that stuff.
Forty-fifteen.
Game, Miss Riggs.
Six-three, third set.
Well done, Miss Riggs.
You were marvelous.
- Just marvelous!
- Thank you very much.
We're serving tea in the teachers' lounge.
I'm sure you could use a little.
Yes, but I'd like to shower first.
That girl gave me a good workout.
Please, Miss Riggs, don't be modest.
I'm sure with your teaching...
our tennis team will improve
tremendously in very little time.
Tell me, does anyone suspect anything?
Anybody know why I'm here?
Not a soul- except for those
the lieutenant has confided in.
Good, then you're the only one.
I'd like to talk to you later.
- Is that possible?
- Yes, of course.
But, tell me, where's the other young lady?
I don't see her anywhere.
Well, I'm on my own.
These jobs are for volunteers.
You're brave, Miss Riggs.
I hope you're capable of
performing your job with discretion.
That is very important.
By the way, where's Willard?
We had to let him go.
We don't have any evidence against him.
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
I'm afraid that's impossible right now.
I'm busy.
It's about the incidents
that have occurred lately.
I don't know a thing about that.
There's nothing strange going on here.
There's nothing going on, is there, dear?
Please excuse us. We're in a big hurry.
Who's there?
It's you. You scared me.
What's going on here?
What are you doing?
- The key! Where's the damn key?
- We don't have a key.
I'll go in through the window
and open the door.
Come on!
Hurry up!
Get help. Quick. Come on!
Use that phone right there.
If the door is locked, knock it down!
Damn bastard.
- What happened?
- He cut a girl's arms off.
And we weren't able
to catch that son of a bitch.
Calm down. We'll get him this time.
Sergeant, make sure they search
every square inch of this building.
- I will.
- Every square inch, got it?
Don't worry.
- Doctor, how is she?
- It's hard to say.
She's alive, but she's lost a lot of blood.
Her condition is critical.
I don't think she'll make it.
God!
That son of a bitch
is probably laughing at us.
What happened?
- Where did you come from?
- What?
Are you deaf?
I asked you where you came from.
- Upstairs, from the library.
- All right.
We'll talk later. Kendall.
Sir, something horrible has happened.
Listen, kid. We have patrol cars
everywhere, but that's not enough.
You need to keep your eyes open
and your ears peeled.
We need your help.
And above all, I ask that you
don't let Miss Riggs out of your sight.
I shouldn't have to ask you this,
but I can't afford to let that
damn maniac get away again!
Go on, get out of here.
Randall, I want a full check
of all the employees.
A thorough check.
- Use the whole department if you need to.
- Very well, Lieutenant.
I thought you'd like that.
Try to do your best.
It won't be long before
this madman gets back to work.
Shut up!
Don't you realize? You're going
to wake the whole campus up.
And you're the one that was afraid
of getting caught? You're unbelievable.
- Oh, Kendall.
- What the heck?
Why do women always end up crying?
Get off me!
You're all the same.
As soon as you get what you want,
you forget all about us.
What are you doing?
You're leaving now?
- Miss Riggs?
- It's you.
- Miss Riggs.
- You scared me to death.
- What happened here?
- I don't know.
I thought I saw someone
running through the garden.
Hey, it's my kung fu teacher.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was jogging
and I was attacked all of a sudden.
But I can see everything's okay.
Good night.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What are you doing out here so late?
The lieutenant asked me
to keep an eye on you.
I saw you go out, but when
I got downstairs, you were gone.
- So I got the bike.
- Next time, forget the bike.
It sounds just like a chainsaw.
- Well, since you're okay, I'll go.
- No way, Kendall!
I'll grab my gun
and leave with you.
All right.
Get on.
Hold on!
Well, thanks a lot...
for saving my life tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Mary?
How about a drink?
Some other time.
Thanks.
Casanova!
You?
Willard?
- Who put that music on? It's unbearable!
- They must be testing it out.
I thought that was your job.
No, ma'am.
I just take care of the garden.
The PA system is controlled
from the dean's office.
Kendall, call and ask them
if someone's testing the system.
There's a phone in the locker room,
if Willard's got the key.
Using that phone is against the rules.
I'll take responsibility for it.
Wait for me there.
- How do you stop that?
- How do I know?
That damn music is driving me crazy!
Willard, isn't there some way
we can stop the music?
I'll try. Come with me.
Let's go.
What about that key?
Don't touch it.
It could be evidence.
If something happened, I mean.
Kendall?
Kendall, where are you?
What happened?
Another one. In there.
It's Susie Billing!
Right!
While we were distracted
by the music...
that bastard was killing her!
Monster!
Monster!
He cut her in two
while she was still alive.
Do you realize how much
that girl must have suffered?
Sergeant, we're running out of time.
I know, Lieutenant. I know.
And I'm doing everything I can.
But if I move too quickly,
I may overlook something important.
- You've gotta give me more time.
- That's what we don't have.
Make a special effort, don't sleep,
anything! But give me a lead.
Lieutenant, I'm doing everything I can,
but I'd like to have some help.
I can't stay up all night.
My eyes are so tired, I can't read anymore.
I think I can get you some help.
You remember Kendall?
That kid could be a great help to us.
Are you kidding?
We can't use a suspect for this.
What kind of nonsense is that?
That kid knows everyone.
He's been in this university
for five years...
and he would notice anything weird
way before anyone else.
Yes, Lieutenant, I know that.
But the rules-
To hell with the rules.
We have to find the killer.
That's what the rules say.
So Kendall will be there
in half an hour.
Don't worry, Mom. I'll fix it.
Professor? Professor Brown?
Do you mind if I walk with you?
I'm a little nervous after what happened.
In broad daylight, in the middle of campus,
I don't think you have too much to fear.
I'm going to Horton Hall.
Is that on your way?
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry, you must think I'm silly,
but after what I saw-
No, not at all.
I'm used to seeing cadavers...
and maybe I'm desensitized.
Unlike the dean,
you seem like a sensitive man.
I think you're not at all familiar
with campus politics.
Why do you say that?
In order to survive on a campus like this one,
you need to be very tough.
I'm not one
to stand in the dean's way.
I'm sure I wouldn't fare too well.
That sounds like the voice of experience,
a bitter experience.
I say it the way I see it.
- Tell me more.
- I have nothing more to say.
Miss Riggs...
I don't like people who pry
into other people's private affairs.
I just want to know
what I've gotten myself into, Professor.
Especially with a maniac on the loose.
- It's me.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous, that's all.
Where were you?
The lieutenant asked me to help
Sergeant Holden check the records.
Well, well.
The lieutenant doesn't play by the book.
Well-
You know where I can find the dean?
He won't be back until this afternoon.
He goes to Arlington
on the first of every month.
But you'll find him in his residence
around 7:00 p.m.
At 7:00? Good, I'll go see him then.
- As you wish.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi. What are we going
to start with today?
Oh, our police apprentice.
Well, I hope you still like this job...
after reading reports for 10 hours.
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No. Why? Does it bother you?
Yeah, I can't stand smoke.
Especially being stuck down here.
Well, you know how it works:
Read each report carefully...
and take note of any reference
to members of the university, all right?
And that's your desk.
Okay.
Well, Miss Riggs. What a surprise.
- I'm sorry. I don't want to bother you.
- Please, come in.
I only wanted to ask you some questions.
Certainly,
but if you insist on staying here...
we'll just have to
make ourselves comfortable.
It is a little silly, isn't it?
This way.
Can I offer you anything?
I was making some tea,
but maybe you'd prefer coffee.
Yes, coffee, please.
You have a very nice apartment.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
I don't hear that often.
It's a little big for one person.
Make yourself comfortable, dear.
Give me just a second, please.
Miss Riggs, how do like your coffee?
With milk and sugar?
Milk and no sugar.
Maybe a little saccharine.
I see you look after your figure.
I wouldn't think you'd need to
with so much tennis.
I'll put a little in.
Just a moment.
Here I am, dear.
Sorry for taking so long.
Here's your coffee.
I don't know if you'll like it.
It's instant coffee.
Thank you.
I put a little saccharine in there,
like you asked.
It tastes great. It's delicious.
You're very kind.
I'm glad you like it.
And now, Miss Riggs, tell me.
What did you want to talk about?
About Professor Brown.
- Professor Brown.
- Yes.
Do you know if he has any problems,
something he'd like to hide?
I hate asking questions like this,
but it's absolutely necessary.
Would you like some more coffee?
Yes.
It was very good.
If we don't find something soon...
I think they're going to investigate
everyone on campus.
Frankly, I don't want to see
this university crawling with cops...
looking for bodies everywhere.
It would be pretty unpleasant.
Sergeant...
this looks important.
He changed his name.
It's no big deal,
but we better find out why.
I'll call the Arlington archive.
I hope someone's there...
even though it is a bit late.
Arlington?
This is Sergeant Holden, in Boston.
I need an enlargement
of file 672947-HF.
It's urgent.
Yes, I'll hold.
You better keep working.
This will take a while.
It's an old guy who sounds
like he's about to drop dead.
Yeah, go ahead. Yes.
Are you sure?
Can you send me a telex
with that information right now?
To our central office.
It's very urgent.
Yes, I understand. That'll be all.
Thank you.
What did he say?
We've got him.
I'm positive the dean is the killer.
Apparently...
his mother was chopped
to pieces when he was a kid...
and that must have left him disturbed.
I imagined it was something like that.
Mary said she was going
to go see the dean at 7:00.
Good Lord.
Why didn't you tell me? Let's go!
- No, stay here and call the lieutenant.
- Yes.
What am I saying?
No! There's no time to lose.
We'll use the radio. Come on, Kendall.
I hope we get there in time.
I'm sorry. The water got cold
and I had to reheat it again.
- Thank you very much.
- Your coffee.
We were talking about
Professor Brown.
He's a homosexual.
I found out by chance
several years ago.
But, for now,
he hasn't broken any rules...
and, therefore,
that's entirely his business.
Don't you think, dear?
Brown was really worried...
about me knowing his little secret...
and he tried to destroy me.
But I'm stronger than him.
I don't feel well.
I feel really weird.
You're feeling the effects
of the drug I've just given you.
You can see and hear
everything I'm saying, can't you?
But you can't move, can you?
Lieutenant?
- Lieutenant.
- What?
An urgent telex.
It's about the crimes at the university.
It looks like they found out
who the killer is.
Tell Rogers to get my car right away!
Nobody will ever find you. Ever!
Sergeant!
Hold on.
You two go around the back.
Let's go.
That way.
Kendall, you stay put here.
Lieutenant, you can't do this to me now.
All right, but stay back.
If somebody shouts "Down!",
hit the dirt like a soldier, okay?
Yes, sir.
Get away from there!
Hold it.
Mary?
What's wrong? For God's sake,
what did he do to you?
- The dean's not here.
- We need to find him. He can't be far.
Kendall, stay with her.
I'll radio for an ambulance.
Come on, Mary.
Mary, please.
You need to walk now. Come on.
Snap out of it. Get up.
Please. Come on, get up!
Come on. It's all over.
Please.
That's it, I'll help you up.
There you go.
That's it, Mary.
Now you have to walk.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
What you have to do now...
is walk a little.
That's it. There you go.
You're doing great, Mary.
Come on.
- Are you okay, kid?
- Yeah.
- You're lucky.
- No kidding.
How's Mary?
She'll recover soon.
She's just drugged.
Bring something to cover him.
Sergeant?
We're going to search everything here.
Mary.
- Take a look at this.
- Let's see.
It's horrible, isn't it?
I wouldn't say that.
She's not that bad-looking.
I never imagined the dean
collected things like this.
- Who would of thought?
- As you see,
you learn something new every day.
Hurry it up.
Where's the lieutenant?
- He left with Miss Riggs.
- All right. You can go.
- How are you feeling?
- Pretty good.
- You still want to be a cop?
- You kidding?
Come on, let's go.
I'll buy you a coffee.
You can rest easy.
You helped avenge their deaths. Let's go.
Just a second.
