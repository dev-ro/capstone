Then you lie here.
The rain falls on my face.
But I don't feel anything.
In a little while they come with
the white tape and make my profile.
A good picture.
The victim in the rain.
Direct flash. Sharp as a knife.
The woman...
There should always be a woman.
There she is.
Dear Mette...
I don't know where I am going
Only, that I am laying
with the back pressed to the planet.
On my way away.
- We could go to Polynesia.
- Did we win the lottery?
- If we don't buy the new car.
- I'm not driving two meters in that wreck.
New car, new apartment, new lamp,
new painting. Everything is new.
- Painkillers...
- One gets old in all this new.
- Do you know where the painkillers are?
- Yes. Near by Equator.
How many times
did you and me sleep together?
If we say the first five years:
five times a week.
The next five years:
maybe twice a week.
2000 times.
I think that is
goddamned too little.
What are you doing?
I'm scared.
No, no, no, no...
Here.
Otherwise I can't see you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Tibetan monks believe that celibacy
leads to absolute insight.
- Do you sleep?
- Mmm.
- Should we go into the living room?
- Why?
I couldn't see anything
but darkness.
Yet from the height of the bed
I could see far away.
My agents reported home
about everything, that is.
The secretive coasts of
Polynesia.
The dessert of Arizona
or the corrals of the Red Sea.
I was the king of Earth.
And my thrown stood high in the north
in a litlle country, that called herself Denmark.
In a new apartment,
that smelled of wet painting.
In a new city without a face on Amager
[a newly build area of Copenhagen].
With limited increase in value
and a very worn down car down in front.
Two wonderful children, Klara and Frederik
and my beautiful wife Mette.
And a job
a little out of the ordinary.
- Where do you work
- In the police.
- Dad takes photos of the dead.
- Then you can photograph my doll.
That I can.
Hold it like this.
- At least she has resisted.
- Humour is a way to survive.
The only problem was,
that Poul wasn't funny.
Frank often asked,
what was most scary.
Pouls jokes
or the crimes?
At first he has
beaten her in to a coma.
Then he has
put in the stick and kicked hard.
- Where is he?
- Upstairs with the kids.
The kids? They didn't say anything
about any kids.
"I love Malte,
Tulle and Charlotte."
"That's why we are travelling away
together. Fuck you."
Four mis-spellings in three sentences.
It has been my dream since I was 14
to become a photographer.
I wanted to photograph
the beauty of the world.
Fly above the world in a helicopter
and photograph the landslides below.
Not dead children.
I didn't know anything about her.
But I will get to
love her unlimited.
Unlimited.
That was the way, one loved Julia.
Like in the movies.
Dramatic. Excited. Excessively.
A sudden encounter
a crazy moment.
And the world
as you know it disapears.
Julia was on the run.
Not from a boring daily round.
But from a sharp, dark shadow,
which had drilled it self into her neck.
Hi mum, it's me.
No, everything's fine.
We are still in Hanoi.
But I'm on the way home.
No, I come alone.
Sebastian had some... business.
He comes later.
It's a little stupid.
But a lot is happening.
Mum...
I'm missing you.
Julia was on the run.
Julia wanted to go away.
Julia was definitely going away.
Going completely away.
Opposite me.
I was never going away.
I was always going home.
- Now we are going to be late.
- Why has I tried this before?
- Old shit.
- You mustn't swear.
- You may at all old shit cars.
- Fucking car.
- Com'on dad.
- It's just...
- It's the fourth time in one week.
- Just what?
- It's stubborn.
- It lies in the family.
Shit, piss, damn,
fucking cock car.
Take it easy, young lady.
yes.
Boys plays with balls
girls jumps hula.
Can you do the shopping today? We are
out of bread and yoghurt and vegetables.
- Klara needs a new drinking bottle.
- Hasn't she just got one?
- I threw that one away.
- Why?
I read about that soft platic.
What's its name?
- Was it made of that?
- I don't know. Buy one made of metal.
- Ftalates.
- The girls, they're skipping...
No, really!
This must be a lie!
...the girls, they're skipping
nicely on tiptoe.
Look, how Pelle is jumping,
skipping lightly and plays,
jumping of and barks now,
vuf, vuf, vuf.
Boys plays with balls
girls jumps hula...
Get down!
Look away.
Look down, Frederik! Oh no...
- Sebastian...
- Everything's gonna be allright.
I can't see. I can't see.
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.
Get a blanket!
Talk to me.
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna... I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.
I'm a doctor.
Are they...?
Oh, my god!
Oh, god.
- She went into a coma.
- Did you find out who she is?
- I haven't got access to a shit.
- I'll call Bundgaard.
- Is he a criminel?
- The speed must be balanced.
So you can brake, in that case
the driver in front gets into trouble.
- I feel, that...
- You were almost taken from behind, Jonas.
Hey. Poul, go up and fetch
an irresponsible piece of danish.
I must go to medico-legal.
It's Julia Castlund.
The art collector.
The guy who is Scandinavias largest
publisher. It must be his daughter.
She arrived to Frankfurt from Hanoi
where she rented a car.
- I'm going there.
- Jonas.
I just wanna see how she is doing.
- Is she pretty?
- Why?
Pretty girls and mystery.
Isn't it like that all dark movies begin?
Hello, can you help me? I'm looking
for a patient, Julia Castlund.
Are you a relative?
We can only inform relatives.
- She has been involved in an accident...
- Don't you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes?
- Julia Castlund?
- Are you relative?
- Yes.
- I'm her boyfriend.
- Hey. Magnus Castlund.
Don't you think it's best
if I'll wait? I don't think...
It's him.
Sebastian?
- You are Sebastian?
- Sorry...
We haven't heard a word from you.
We left a thousand messages.
Oh no.
- The cell phone is invented.
- He doesn't look that stupid.
Angkor wat. The night I called
was your first night.
- Julia had changed.
- Sorry...
- It's a little difficult.
- It's a little difficult?
- Yes.
- It's a little difficult for him.
- It is Sebastian.
- He gets cold feets.
What the hell
are you thinking about, man?
- Why didn't you just tell them who you were?
- They were all crying.
- I should just keep a straight face.
- And when Sebastian turns up?
Then they find out, don't they?
And that even wasn't the worst part.
You should have been there
with the doctor.
That girl, she was so lively.
This girl may be bound to
a respirator the rest of her life.
I've seen many
who runs away.
I've seen many
who runs away.
It's about life and death.
It's about life and death.
Do you want to help or don't you?
Yoy mustn't go down.
You mustn't break down.
You mustn't break down.
- Do you understand what I am saying?
- Do you understand what I am saying?
Sit down.
Julia, I'm here.
Now we are together again.
And I won't leave you.
- Now you must come back to us.
- You should kiss her.
Maybe... Maybe she feels it.
- Kiss her.
- Yes.
Thank you, Sebastian.
- Where do you live?
- At a friends.
Why don't you come to ours place?
I'm fine at Franks.
But thank you.
- Call.
- Yes.
What did you do, when you sat with the
defenceless girl in a coma in the darkness?
- What I did?
- Did you held her hand?
- Where did you held her?
- Now you are really sick in your brain.
Hey, Sebastian.
My name is Irma.
I must bath Julia.
But can you do it.
- Oh...
- Come.
And then it's under her arms
and between her legs.
And other places where you
feel she burns. Good.
Call me it there is anything.
- Sebastian...
- Julia.
Sebastian.
Are you mine?
I've been looking for yo long.
Where have you been?
Around.
- Are you home now?
- Yes.
Till death do us part.
No. Nothing can part us.
Not even death.
Julia, who are you?
Where did you come from?
Where did you come from?
Why
didn't I leave Julia just there?
Maybe because my reality
simply was too real.
And Julias was mysterious.
Pretty women and mystery.
I guess it was just that.
I was curious.
I was just curious.
What are you doing?
I'm from Copenhagen
Police, technical department.
Yes you find many strange
things in cars.
I once found a pair of shoes
And a teddy bear.
And a whole coca-cola
which were full.
I also found a dead cat.
That was pretty disgusting.
Did you find anything in
the trunk of this one?
It's very important you tell me
if you found anything in this one.
Did you find anything?
What did you find?
- What did you say the guy was called?
- Sebastian Christersson.
Sebastian Christersson.
You must go back
and say it as it is.
- I'll just keep away.
- And runs into the crowd one day?
Every one of the Castlunds.
What do you think little Mette would say?
No. I better go back
and say it as it is.
Good idea.
Dear mr and mrs Castlund,
I've made a crime.
The other day I walked in
as clown in huge shoes.
You were in a state of chok and I was afraid
of telling the truth. It was a big mistake.
I'm not Sebastian
but I was a witness to Julias accident.
I work as a photographer in the criminal
technical department and I found the suitcase.
I'm sorry. I wish you the best of
luck in this hard time
and Julia, I hope you will be better soon.
Sincerely, a friend.
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
It's so good you came.
You're going to be so, so, so happy.
You're going to be so happy.
Julia has awakened.
Julia has lost 90% of her sight. But the
chance of her regaining her sight is big.
Sebastian is here.
Sebastian...
Your Sebastian.
What are you talking about?
I don't know anyone called
Sebastian.
Julia, do you have a boyfriend?
Sebastian.
Julia, now we going to try once more -
slowly and quiet.
Come, sit here.
This is Sebastian. Your boyfriend.
You met in Asia,
where you were in 9 months.
Oh god.
I'm sorry.
I don't remember anything.
Julia, Julia, Julia.
easy.
- How are you?
- This is too stupid.
Yes. I know what you are thinking.
I have talked to Dichmann.
Julia might end the rest of her life
in a wheel chair
Try listening. This is all...
This is all a big misunderstanding.
- Here. I have signed it.
- This is not about money.
No. Exactly.
Now it's all about helping Julia.
I hire you
to help her.
I buy a some of your time.
I don't worry about
what happens later.
But for the sake of god
give her some love.
Look at her.
My daughter is destroyed.
You can't in decency back put now
when she needs your help the most.
You can at least pretend.
Write 100.000, one million.
What ever you want.
I've known women who could act
in love for considerable less.
What if I told you,
that I'm not Sebastian.
Then I would call a
damn coward.
It is you!
Sebastian!
Julia would like to talk to you.
Dichmann says,
you are my best medicine.
Have we known eachother long?
Yes, a couple of months.
Dad said,
we had called from Cambodja.
Angkor wat.
What happened there?
What happened?
How did we meet?
It was a fire.
And it was night.
Small groups gathered in the twilight.
And got to know eachother.
People from all over the world.
- Was I alone?
- Yes.
- And you were alone too?
- Yes.
How do you look?
Ordinary.
Tall or short? Dark or light?
In between.
Regular. I blend with the wall.
What happened then?
You were sitting alone.
With a danish flag on you backbag
I offered you a bottle of Chang.
- Chang?
- The local shitty beer.
Two danes in Angkor wat.
What a coincidence.
Well.
Love at first sight.
If you believe in that.
What are you doing by the way?
I am a photographer. Travelling
around the world and photograph.
For what?
National Geographic.
Reportage. A little of everything.
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
It took you too long.
I don't love you.
No.
I don't fall in love.
That's sad.
I've always been afraid
of rutines.
Fixed times.
Fixed meals.
I hate rituals.
I don't want any obligations,
I don't take responsibility.
Can you imagine a life like that?
What life?
Husband, wife, a house in the suburbs.
Two screaming kids
and a sad job. Television.
Friends for dinner every saturday, sex
on fixed days, when the kids are sleeping.
No... No.
No, I can't imagine that.
It must be horrible.
Or maybe it is wonderful.
Everything is predictable.
What was it, that you and I could?
We could...
Then I think I want
a rum and coke, please without coke.
- We could see.
- See?
We could experience. We were running
away from a very little country.
And we wanted to see a world,
that was so much bigger -
then coffee
herrings and smalltalk.
And you provoked med
and I provoked you.
We surprised eachother all the time.
All the time, a new experiment.
And all the time,
all the time with love.
Sex?
Several times a day.
- You're lying.
- No...
Did I come?
I never can come.
You came all the time.
You bragg.
What are you saying
Yeah, welcome,
it's nice you could come.
- We just said that.
- Thank you for having us, Jonas.
Yeah, but anyway, welcome.
Where did we go
after Angkor wat?
- With this speed we will soon have drinken it all.
- Where's the other bottles?
- Polynesia.
- What?
- What?
- Polynesia?
- There's a long way.
- Yes.
I've always dreamed
of seeing Polynesia.
Are you ill?
Did you hear that Karsten and Henriette are
going to get a divorce too? He found a polish girl.
I see it this way:
Marriage is like a new car.
You are fucking happy.
It smells nice and shines.
But then slowly you get lazy.
You stop vacuuming the mats.
- We too have thought about buying a new car.
- You forget an empty can.
You just want a new one.
If only you made it to a fixed routine
just once a week to wash the car, -
vacuum the mats, clean the panels and
and clean the rims, -
then you would have
a new car all the time.
Somebody had poisoned my apple.
But then you came and kissed me.
Then I woke up.
Should we try once more?
My face is destroyed, isn't it?
I think you are beautiful.
I think you've got the fever.
- I'll talk a walk.
- What are you saying?
- I need some fresh air.
- We got company, honey.
Julia, I have to tell you something.
It's very hard to say it.
I know, what you want to say. Now leave.
I don't know what it was like out there,
But everything is different now.
You don't need me.
And I don't need you.
Okay.
What did you think I wanted to say?
Leave now. Just leave.
What happened?
What happened last week,
happens this week and in the week to come.
- I'm dying, Frank.
- Who the hell isn't?
- I feel like...
- you feel like what?
- Limp.
- Get a moustache.
What is most horrible? The cave of
Afghanistan or screaming kids?
A wife that only wants to fuck when
the headache allows it? You know what?
You maybe be the lucky one,
you and Poul and Kirsten -
and Mette and the whole fucking Amager,
who has seen the light.
If only there is anybody! Hello!
Is there anyone who are breathing?
Amager, can you hear me?
Have you seen the light?
Listen, if you need to stretch
your legs a little, -
then buy a blowjob of a lithuanian.
What's the probem? 450 krones.
- Julia needs me.
- "Julia needs me."
Julia needs me.
Does Julia need you, ha?
Jonas, you are not Sebastian, okay?
You are Jonas. Jonas.
I don't fucking know if they're breathing.
I don't fucking know.
They don't.
- I'm Jonas.
- Yes, you are Jonas.
He will be there tomorrow anyway.
Sebastian.
Sebastian Christersson is dead.
- What?
- Murdered.
I got a message from Hanoi. They found
him in a hotel, shot right in the head.
- I'll go to her.
- Goddamned, Jonas.
- Am I crazy?
- Yes! You are in love.
Is anyone here?
Who is it?
Sebastian?
Is it you?
Did you sleep?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
I thought I heard you before.
Maybe I was dreaming.
- Have you been drinking?
- A lot.
I am glad, you are here.
Aren't you going to answer it?
It doesn't matter.
Maybe it is important.
Take me.
- Do you want to make love?
- No thanks.
- Are you fucking someone else?
- Mette.
I would like to know it.
- You have to answer me honestly.
- Stop it.
- Do you want to answer me honestly?
- Yes. I'll answer you honestly.
Come come. You have to turn me.
Turn me.
Is there someone else?
No, Mette.
Where did you go?
I just needed to stretch
my legs a little.
I think we will need to cars.
- And then you spend 139.000 krones?
- It helps when you are frustrated.
I was 139.000 krones frustrated.
Sit here.
What's going on here? I don't fucking
use this size.
What? I have a fucking bigger ass
after two kids.
I didn't know you were one of those
who get turned on by dirty panties!
- Where did you find them?
- In this one.
Nice done, Mette. Nice done.
Do you know what that is?
It's a very fragile piece
of evidence from a scene of crime.
- Uh!
- A murder. And know you spoiled it.
In the last 14 days you have...
You have been gone, Jonas.
You don't talk to me
You don't touch me. You are gone.
What the hell is happening?
Where are you?
So this is your hotline?
This is Mette and Jonas.
Hello?
No, I'm not Julia.
I don't know
if this is her telephone. Wait a second.
- Is that her name? Julia?
- Mette, hang up. Hang up.
I guess this is her phone
but she's not here.
I think she is busy fucking my husband.
Please try again later.
- Where are you going?
- Work.
- What's happening?
- Nothing.
It's a wonderful house.
Right by the beach.
In the distance you can see
Kullen in a sunny day.
The whole time.
The sound of the sea.
You feel the sun in the neck.
It sounds nice.
As soon as I get up
we could go there -
and spend a couple of months
I'll proberly needs some help.
There is nothing a rather want to do.
Something fantastic has happened.
You made me pregnant.
Isn't it amazing?
But, when?
Before or after?
- What do you mean?
- Here or in Asia?
Here.
Right here.
But that is fantastic.
It's amazing as she is recovering.
We rarely see something like it.
A couple of weeks ago she was almost
dying. Now she can go home.
- With a little help, of course.
- Yes.
- Did Julia tell you she is pregnant?
- Yes, that is fantastic.
Yes... Sebastian.
I don't really know,
how I should put this.
Maybe it's very simple.
I think you are the biggest asshole,
I have ever met.
- What?
- You fucking pevert.
Where are you going?
- I can explain everything.
- What are there to explain?
It just happened.
The misunderstanding.
But what happened between us...
It might be that the scene is false,
but the feeling is true.
I don't know,
what happened to Julia.
But I will find out what happened.
And she will be told, who I am.
- I'm just waiting for...
- what the hell are you talking about?
Fucking your wife while she
is in a coma. Ugh!
- What?
- We know exactly when it happened.
God damned she was in coma!
Then I think you ought to investigate...
Are you suggesting that it is us
who fuck the patients? Did you enjoy it?
Stop it!
Now I said it. I'll only protect you,
to help her.
I insists you see a psyciatrist.
Here's a number.
And then you say hello from me,
and say that it is urgent.
- Dichmann... Dichmann!
- Shut up!
Hey!
Hey!
Should we search everything to find
a man in bandages? You fucked!
It was later. And how do we know
that Sebastian is dead?
They found the body, brought it in
and wrote a death certificate.
- Where did you get it?
- I made them fax it.
If you are going to have his name, there
shouldn't be anyone who wants your head, right?
- I was shot in the breast.
- And declared dead after arrival.
Just keep it. It's a present.
He looks like one of these losers, -
who only travels
to get laid.
He works at a bar, spends all his money,
needs some money for coke, -
meets some chineses and make some
money on thansporting suitcases.
- Does the police in Hanoi know this?
- Maybe this was Julias job.
- She didn't need any money.
- Doesn't she rebels against rich daddy?
By the way, they'd like to talk to her.
Maybe it's them who have called.
- How's Mette doing?
- Like shit.
Do you remember when we were in middle school?
We had leather bracelets with holes, -
and then we wrote the name on the girl,
we wanted to date.
- You had Lise. I had Joan.
- Until we switched. We just switched.
Evrything was so simple then.
If you don't want Mette,
then I will take Mette.
- Are you threatening me? Mette is my wife.
- That's right. Fuck the emotions.
- Decide.
- Fuck you. What do feel like?
Fuck you, Jonas.
Do you want to hear what I feel like?
I feel for these fools who I see
dead, because something ridiculous -
has happened in their love life.
Disappointment, hatred, decieve, rage.
Do you know why the idiot
shot his family the other day?
First the wife threw him out, and then
she fucked his best friend.
Is he or she crazy?
I don't know, Jonas.
I believe in the muslims.
Do it for practical reasons.
Do it to get kids. Do it to
get a camel. Make a contract.
Fuck love.
- Are we a little cynical today?
- Are you a pathetic romanticist?
Not to speak about this fool.
She wrote a suicide note.
"Say hello to everyone and say
that if Johnny hadn't left, -
I would still be dancing
around the living today."
Nine misspellings in one sentence.
Now, that you decided to commit suicide,
couldn't you at least learn to spell right?
Isn't there someting about illiteracy
and love in despair is contagious?
Henriques.
Where is love placed?
It's placed here.
in this area,
where lust meets association.
There the desire crosses a
progressive, floating force.
There it crosses the harmony
the need for rest and silence.
two incompatible quantities.
That's probably why things are so shitty.
Unfortunately you can't cut it out
without causing handicaps.
you two lovely kids,
what's happening to them?
Do you know what?
I'm about to vomit over myself.
But does everything has to stop until
one child reaches 18 and leaves home?
Is it the dad, Klara and Frederik
has to grow up with?
Are you joining lunch?
There is hearts in cream sauce.
Just go.
I'll be there in a little while.
Where does those hearts come from,
I only ask.
- We're out of everything.
- What?
We are out of almost everything.
Do you remember if
we are out of toiletpaper?
Would you please wake up?
Toiletpaper. Jonas!
Would you please... Don't ruin
this morning.
Right? Please try a little.
We have...
Mette...
What were you doing?
- I can't do this.
- What can't you do?
- This.
- What do you mean?
- Do you want to do the shopping somewhere else?
- I'm sorry, Mette.
Do you smell of alcohol?
There's a lot you and me can do, but
it's not enough. Simply isn't enough.
- What are you saying?
- That I can't do this.
Someday we'll day
and then we are gone from hear.
- What are you talking about?
- This.
- Can't do what?
- Everything, Mette. Everything.
Are you ending it?
- Is this place a good place to do this?
- There is no good place to do it.
You're crazy.
I don't want to go through life
with a handbill.
Is it her?
You are destroying our life, you are.
You are standing here and destroy our life.
...with usual iron will, you finally proclaim:
"I never find a husband in this
small provincial fucking country."
"I want out and find a husband.
I want out and see something."
Of course you would find a husband.
Because you had made up your mind for it.
But what kind of husband?
Not just a husband, no.
A regular husband,
And that's fantastic!
The first time we saw Sebastian,
we thought: "Is that Julias husband?"
I mean, he was neither
mountaineer or drug dealer or...
Or wild and mad in some other way.
No, he was completely normal.
Thank you. Thank you , Sebastian,
because you have so good manners -
and nice and natural and regular and
normal. Thank you, sweet Sebastian.
- Cheers!
- Now we must drink.
Maybe the scene was false.
But the feeling was true.
Reality was very far away. And I
doubted if it ever came back.
Everyday I prolonged the day,
I would tell Julia the truth.
And in the end it didn't matter.
Because Sebastians face grew steady.
And Jonas' dissapeared.
You never cashed the check.
Which check?
You are stupid.
It must be that day, God used
as prototype for all good days.
Should we make a child today?
We have only known eachother for...
...an eternity.
Only an eternity?
You...
Julia.
Now you must relax in the summer house.
You are not going anywhere in that state
whether it is summer house or...
I don't think it's a good idea
that you are going now.
- We'll solve it.
- There are many things you need to solve.
Now, there's peace and quiet. Call us if anything
happens. It's only one hour from here.
Exactly. It's just one hour.
Now go.
- Julia...
- Yes?
i love you. There is nothing,
that can tear us apart.
Nothing can tear us apart.
Not even death.
I dreamed something strange. I was out
swimming. Then a whale came.
It opened its mouth to swallow me.
But inside on the tongue, an old man
with a beard like Ho Chi Minh stands
and shouts: "Watch out! Watch out!'
But it isn't Ho Chi Minh.
Because on his T-shirt
his name is printet. Jonah.
I woke up and thought: "Why
is Jonas in the whale called Jonah?"
I don't know anyone called Jonas.
- Why Ho Chi Minh?
- Yeah, why?
Becuase Jonah backwards is Hanoi.
Have you ever hit me?
No!
- Did we argue?
- No, never.
Shouldn't I get a planket
and some warm tea?
The number of messages was six.
- First message:
- It's me. Call me right away.
Where the hell are you? Call!
Jonas, it's all wrong.
I must be talk to you.
OK, Jonas. I took fingerprints
of the wheelchair, the guy was sitting in, -
- and I ran them in the system.
They belong to Sebastian Christersson.
I fucking don't understand a thing.
Call me!
I'm dead.
Do you understand?
I'm dead.
I have traced him to a hotel on Vesterbro
[old area of Copenhagen]. He is on Vesterbro!
I can't reach you. I gonna find out,
what he fuck is happening here.
There are no new messages.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are Julia there?
- What is it about?
I'm her boyfriend.
Sebastian.
- Is she here?
- No.
- But, isn't this Castlund...
- There is no Julia here.
Sebastian?
Julia?
- Where is she?
- We sat down by the water.
- You are?
- When did you come?
- It's a long story.
- Sebastian?
Did you walk the whole way?
Do we have guests?
Who is it?
You must be Julia.
Hi.
I'm...
- Jonas.
- Jonas?
I've just dreamed about you
You did?
Did you arrive in a whale or a car?
In a car from Sweden. I'm going to
Jylland. And I wanted to say hi.
He has been talking so much about you.
I won't be here long.
Are you busy?
No, not really.
Then stay for dinner.
- I don't want to...
- Of course you are staying.
Sebastian, right?
But, that offer I won't decline.
I just go to the car and
pick up some titbits. Nice.
- Is it a car?
- Yes.
Then a Jonas arrived.
yes.
- Did you feel that?
- Groce.
Do you always carry this with you?
It was supposed to be used
to seduce an old girlfriend.
And now I eat her oysters
and drink her champagne.
I suppose you get something like this every day?
Sebastian says your familily is rich.
He do?
Are you blind?
On good days I can se shadows.
- Where are you, Sebastian?
- What is it you are doing? Then say it!
Say what?
- Tell the truth.
- OK, this is a dissapointment to me.
That you haven't told Julia about us.
told what?
We were boyfriends.
Stop it.
I swear. Sebastian and I
were together for three years.
I mean, we weren't gay-gays.
We loved women.
We were really good friends, right?
We tucked eachother in,
shouldn't we say it like that?
Jesus, Sebastian.
But, Sebastian fucked everything,
that walked. Isn't it right, Sebastian?
Holy shit,
you were a swine with your dick.
I don't know anything about you.
What is it, you want?
Sorry. I didn't thought
you had secrets for eachother.
What is it, I don't know?
I'm so sorry.
You don't have to say sorry.
I know.
It's my mistake.
Sorry.
Sorry, Jonas.
It's because it's been sofucking long time
since we have last seen eachother
Of course, there is a
good reason for that.
I'm glad, that the six years hasn't
been that hard. You can feel that.
Prison use to b hard to people.
All the voilence. No love.
And the love from the other inmates,
isn't it more like rape?
What did you do time for?
Drugs. Jonas was a drug smuggler
and roved in South East Asia
Had some small jobs
from Beijing to Sydney.
Always with someone at his heels.
Always with a suitcase.
Jonas was always on the run.
What was it, that fucked you up?
What went wrong?
Why are you sitting here
and says something like that
Did I insult you? Why are
you saying I was in prison?
What's happening?
I'm sorry if I said somthing,
I shouldn't have said.
I could feel right from the start
that I wasn't welcome.
I was just because Julia insisted
that I should sit here and...
- I think, I must leave.
- What is it, you want?
Julia, I think I'm leaving. Sebastian
and I have some problems...
Please sit down.
What is it you want, ah?
Did you here from Frank?
Frank?
I don't even know who Frank is.
What happened in Hanoi? Can you tell
me what happened? Can you?
- What happened in Hanoi?
- I don't know, what happened.
- I have no idea what you are talking about.
- Now you tell me what happened.
Stop it! Now you get outside
and get some fresh air.
Get some cigatettes
or something.
Maybe it is a good idea
to get some fresh air.
Then you can relax a bit.
If you are driving, you can take my car.
I'm parked infront of yours.
If you even want to drive
such an old car.
Are you all right?
of course I'm all right.
This is Frank Behrings voice mail.
Leave a message and I will call back.
Hi, Frank. He has come up here.
It's crazy.
I really don't know what he want. Call.
I am with the phone, okay.
- It was stupid of me.
- You told the truth.
It's me and my big mouth.
You know how hot-tempered he is.
But he has changed
unbelievable much.
He has?
Sebastian has so many feelings.
I think he is one the most sensitive
person I have ver met.
But sometimes
it besomes too big for him.
It becomes too much.
His love turns to...
...madness.
Do you know his former relationships?
This is very difficult for me.
I don't won't to let Sebastian down,
but I have to tell truth.
Do you sometimes sense,
that Sebastian hiding something?
Yes.
- You don't remember anything, do you?
- No.
He says, everything
was fantastic out there.
It wasn't.
Julia...
I'm not going to Jylland,
I rushed up here, -
when I heard about your strange
reunion with Sebastian.
Tell.
He was crazy,
when he called me in Hanoi.
I don't know if it was LSD
He was desperate.
It was Sebastian, who travelled around
with a suitcase i South East Asia.
He worked for
some horrible people.
He should smuggle some diamands
over the boarder. It went wrong.
And you only cheat the Triade once.
This is Frank Behrings...
Why didn't we run?
He was setenced to death.
His only way put was as a body.
Then what?
You should die together.
You must get us away from here.
Do you mean that?
I'm with the man,
I ran away from.
You must help me.
This is Frank...
This is Frank Behrings voice mail.
Leave a message and I will call back.
I don't understand it.
Has he told you about Hanoi?
You were at a hotel.
You left him there.
I keep seeing that door.
I'm walking towards it.
If we are to move on, you have to go back
and walk through that door.
You must enter.
You must enter.
- They will kill us,
- Give them what they want.
It's too late.
It's too late. It's too late.
Let me go!
At least we have eachother, right?
No, no, no. No!
What are you doing? Don't you love me?
What?
I want you to say that you love me.
I want you... you to say...
that you love me!
I want you to say that you love me.
I love you.
I love you.
Orfeus loves you, Eurydike.
We are going to get out of here.
I just cannot turn around.
He just want to see,
if it is her, that follows him.
And that's why she goes the
the kingdom of death.
That's why they only
can be together in death.
Listen to me.
Orfeus must die first.
If they are to reunite.
First Orfeus. Come.
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
I love you, Orfeus.
If you come to the kingdom of death
I will follow you. I promise you.
I promise you. I promise you.
You know.
You know.
I love you.
You promise, you will follow?
You promise, you will follow!
I promise.
Orfeus should never have turned around.
You didn't want him.
Can you imagine how that felt?
Orfeus has fought like a mad man
to get to Eurydike.
Then when he arrives, they stand
and laugh and say: "Eurydike?"
"No, no, no. She is not here.
She has left with someone else."
Come. Lets go outside
and finish this.
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
What the hell is it
you are doing, Jonas?
You see?
What do you mean?
Did you start smoking again?
- The children.
- I only smoke under the range hood.
Very carefully.
- Can I take one?
- Yes.
- How is your new car?
- Perfect.
I told you,
we would need two cars.
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.
I don't know how it got so far out.
It just happened.
And the ground dissapeared below me.
I'm not crying.
But I hit the ground very hard.
You have always dreamed
about flying, right?
Who hasn't?
I miss Frank.
It might well be he was mad.
But you could see his madness.
Do you wanna see the children?
Wait a little.
You can take this fucking
suitcase with you. Bad karma.
- When do we see eachother again?
- I'll call.
I was leaving
and still going home.
It was a good evening.
Not a Hollywood ending.
But good enough.
Like Amager.
There is not happening that much.
Bur what happened,
happened yesterday.
And luckily something
will happen tomorrow.
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
Safe and nice.
Then you lie here.
The rain falls on my face.
But I don't feel anything.
In a little while they come with
the white tape and make my profile.
A good picture.
The victim in the rain.
Direct flash. Sharp as a knife.
The woman...
There should always be a woman.
