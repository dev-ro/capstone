Dad!
It's about time.
Push.
Breathe deeply.
Xiaochun, the baby won't come out.
I want you to play her something.
The livelier the better.

Liu Cheng!
Taste this.
It's delicious.
Liu Cheng may come from the north...
but he sure can cook a tasty southern dish.
If I were a woman, I'd marry him.
I like your son Xiaochun.
He wasn't much when you arrived.
What a violinist he's become!
A little something for him.
No, I couldn't.
- Take it.
- I'd rather not.
Xiaochun, come here.
Xiaochun, I want to thank you.
Take this.
Buy yourself whatever you like.
Thanks, Mr. Debao.
Xiaochun, at least you understand how
life works.
Liu Cheng, a letter.
Community News: Liu Xiaochun will
compete in Beijing.
Dad, my back itches.
Here?
Fortunate Mr: Debao had an 8 lb. 8 oz. Boy.
Nice shot!
- Taking much cash with you?
- Guess.
1,500?
2,000?
No, guess again.
3,000?
I'll leave you guessing.
Chun, it's urgent.
I need a toilet, and fast.
Wait for me here. Don't budge.
Need a place to stay?
Cheap beds, good service.
Anyone need a room?
Watch it. My hair!
Fix it nice.
Kid, grab the suitcase.
I'll give you a receipt.
- Who called for help?
- I did.
What's the problem?
I've lost my child.
- When was this?
- Just now.
He was right here 10 minutes ago.
I had diarrhea...
Let me explain.
He began the violin at age 3.
Since age 5, he's won a local prize
every year.
What a catastrophe.
- Age?
- 13.
- Boy or girl?
- Boy.
Chun, where on earth were you?
It's your turn.
YOUNG PEOPLE'S HALL
- That's my boy.
- He's good.
The winner's parents, come forward.
Director Chang!
Mr. Chang, meet Liu Xiaochun.
Good work.
You play very well.
If your school accepts him...
we can stay here and try to bring you honor.
Unfortunately, you need a Beijing
residence permit to stay.
I can't help you.
However, if a private teacher takes him,
we won't object.
Jiang, how did you like the competition?
Your music exam's always the same.
What do you mean our exam?
You're on staff here, too.
How much did the winner pay to win?
We accept targeted contributions
to offset costs.
Is it wrong to express gratitude?
No favoritism, no sponsors.
The good player finished where?
You mean number five?
You remain perceptive as ever.
Professor Jiang.
Oh, Professor!
My name is Liu Cheng.
I'm number five's father.
Number five? So?
What's the big deal?
Wow, I'm bowled over.
He's home.
Professor.
This is your teacher. Say hello.
Go on!
I entrust him to you.
Let me do that.
Will lessons be once or twice a week?
Be strict. Strict is fine by me.
It's best for the child, to be strict.
Beijing folks are sharp.
But my son is their match.
Smart and adroit.
Every year a prize, like clockwork.
Back home, nobody's heard of Liu Cheng...
but everybody knows Xiaochun's father.
This is a real opportunity for you.
I'm telling you straight.
Understand that Xiaochun...
Fine. I get the picture.
Explore a bit of Beijing together.
See the Forbidden City and go home.
Are you kidding?
He finished fifth, didn't he?
I'll level with you.
He should have been first.
You get it?
Even if he plays great, he won't succeed.
Do you understand?
Mr. Jiang, your words just make me want
to stay even more.
The truth is...
he was a baby when his mother left.
Her violin remained.
He began to play it because he missed her.
Whenever he thinks of her,
he plays the violin.
I don't want anything to hurt him.
Chun!
It's 11:00. You can come in.
Tell me.
20 yuan buys a bath and a bunk.
Is that right?
That's right. Why?
You're sure?
Chun, a bath and a bed for 20 yuan...
is quite a deal.
A bath with the room.
You asleep?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Zhang Lifa, listen to yourself.
You haven't played a single note on key.
Not one.
Really?
Yes. Really.
Now start over.
Hello?
That you?
I'm at the kid's violin lesson.
That's right, it's culture.
Mean anything to you?
What's the problem?
What?
You under his thumb?
He demands, and you deliver!
If he said to jump in the lake, would you?
I owe him money? That's a laugh.
He has no proof.
Press charges?
I didn't say stop.
I'll sue right back. For slander.
I didn't sign an IOU.
You listen good. If you give him one cent...
you'll feel my wrath.
Come on, honey,
let's not stay another minute.
Goodbye.
Get this straight.
We're dumping you, and not vice versa.
Come along!
Come back.
Don't forget your bow.
Teachers are a dime a dozen.
Thanks for letting me quit.
You, at the door!
Come in. Stop lurking like a thief.
Yes, sir, Professor.
Come here, boy.
Would you remove that red hat?
It makes me uneasy.
The thing is...
I must be incompetent.
Not at all! You're a good teacher.
Oh, yeah? Then why did she fire me?
We...
We would like to hire you.
Liu Xiaochun, before we start,
some ground rules.
First, you'll have to work hard.
Otherwise, it's pointless.
Second, you must enjoy playing.
Refrain from playing unless you enjoy it.
And finally, don't play only when you 
think of your mother.
That's it.
Play something.
Who is it?
Hello, is this Mr. Cheng?
Cut it out, I know it's you.
I miss you already. Now what?
I miss you, too.
Oh, yeah. Then why leave me?
Do you give other women such nice shoes?
What other women?
Do you love me?
Not this again!
Yes or no?
You're always asking!
You must love me a lot.
Is that a yes or a no?
I love you.
- I love you, babe.
- You know I'm up here.
You can't outfox a sly old fox.
- I've got to go.
- Clown!
That guy your uncle?
He needs directions.
Did you find it okay?
Yes.
Here in Beijing...
it's easier to find a bride than housing.
You're lucky indeed.
Come in.
Hey! Violin-boy!
Here!
Up here!
You mean me?
Yes, you. Come on up!
85471.
Where do you wander by starlight?
Where do you wander?
That's right.
When you've got a sec, call me.
He knows my number. Sign it Mimi.
Hello?
Tell him I've moved to a new apartment.
The number is 62 87 54 53.
Sign it "Your babe."
How old are you?
I'm 13.
You're not bad on that violin.
Play me something.
Lonely Makes Me Lovely.
Don't know it?
The Moon Reflects My Heart.
Play.
Hi, Fanny. I've moved.
I'm still unpacking.
The old apartment was fine.
But Mr. X ran out of cash.
What are you up to?
You still with that guy?
New topic.
What's-his-name isn't bad looking.
Is he rich?
No kidding?
Millions?
I'm his type?
Gotta see if I like him.
He says that to all the girls.
Give me his number.
What is it?
I may not even call him.
Hello? Mr. Han?
It's me, Lili.
Why are you such a bad boy?
Wait, I'll go to another room.
I'm all ears.
Stupid boy!
Was it you at the station?
I didn't recognize you.
What brings you here?
I live right over there.
See you around!
You're really something.
You test my patience.
- I what?
- You pile your coal here...
without concern for me.
We all share this courtyard. Get it?
Delivery guy's choice.
Don't fish for excuses.
- Don't be silly!
- You dare hit me?
Watch it!
What?
Same routine every year.
You blame the delivery guy.
You encourage him just to spite me!
If you take that tone...
it's unlikely I'll move it. It's fine where it is.
- Will you move it away?
- Nope!
No?
No.
Fine. In that case, it's all mine.
Say that again?
I'll be nice and warm this winter.
Just try it, you'll see!
I'll help myself.
Put that back!
Kid, what do you think you're doing?
Is over here okay?
Yes. Thank you.
What's your game?
Helpful, aren't we?
You're aiding the enemy!
Some teacher you are!
Wash your hands.
Use soap.
Hold it.
I'm overwhelmed here. 
Come help me.
Give me a hand.
He followed a lady cat and got beaten up.
Stop!
Get the medicine on the shelf.
You don't know how. I'll do it.
Close it up.
Mix the milk with water.
The kittens are hungry, too.
Careful when you feed Mimi.
Remove the bones.
Watch it, clumsy.
He has bad teeth.
Less salt in his.
Kidney problems, too.
Stay there. Don't be such a klutz.
Go on. Play.
What smells so awful?
Did kitty pee under the bed again?
Did you do that?
I'll do it.
See if you find a sock.
A black one.
No sock here.
Just this photo.
That's odd.
Okay, back to work.
Hey! Where are you going?
My father pays you for violin lessons.
Liu Xiaochun.
- How much for 1 lb. Of rice?
- 1.6 yuan.
How much is your rice?
- What did he quote you?
- 1.5 yuan.
I'll give it to you for 1.3.
How about 1 yuan even?
I'll make it 0.9. Deal?
Stealing my client?
What of it? I do as I please!
Bastard! I'll trash your stand!
Here's a solution.
I propose this. 
I'll buy 5 lbs. From each.
You stay out of this.
It's between him and me.
No, that's not mine.
My hat!
Chun.
I screwed up.
I lost my cap.
Good.
Why good?
I won't have to look at it.
But the money! My money was inside.
Here, Dad.
- Where'd you get that?
- I earned it.
Take it.
Lower your head. Admit your mistake!
Hi there.
Come play tonight. It's my friend's birthday.
Go get the sheet music.
Liu Xiaochun.
Today you'll rejuvenate sheet music.
You know what that means?
- Rejuvenating means...
- To wipe off the dust.
See the pencil marks?
She wrote them in.
We were classmates at the Conservatory.
We often copied scores together.
When I was with her...
I felt pretty good.
Do you like her notes?
Shortly before graduation...
she told me...
another guy wanted to date her...
and asked my advice.
I said, "Sounds good."
The classmate in question was a 
real go-getter.
That's a good trait, no?
Later on...
I realized she loved me.
I was such a dope!
I liked her.
Anyway, that was that.
She married the other guy...
and left me here.
I hear she's divorced.
Never saw her again.
The piece you played the other day...
was our graduation farewell.
I'm telling all this to a kid.
That's a laugh.
Professor Jiang.
You never married?
Who would have me?
Plus, if I bring a woman here...
my cats will have to go.
I have my music...
to warm my heart.
Chef, you don't put tomato sauce on
fish-basted pork strips.
You want some pork strips?
I'm not here to eat.
I'm a cook. The temp agency sent me.
That's the boss.
You're the boss?
Can you ride a bike?
That's hot.
Here.
Put that down...
and feel the music in your heart.
What have we here?
Wait a minute.
The other day, you said...
Why, you little sneak.
Making fun of me, eh?
This is such a filthy sock.
What do you say...
we leave it there?
Give me a hand. I'm way behind.
Find the hair dryer.
Hurry up!
It's not here.
Look over there.
No, my feet. Do my toes.
What do you know?
That's my least favorite.
Sit down. And no peeking.
I put on the one you picked.
Guess what this is.
A birthday cake.
What's written on it?
Happy birthday?
Wrong!
He was born at 8:05 p.m. Original, huh?
The cell phone you've reached is
unavailable at this time.
Forget it.
Play. I'm listening.
What's your name?
Liu Xiaochun.
I'm Lili.
Two little honeybees gather pollen
in the breeze...
Dad!
Who's that woman?
A friend.
Not so fast, comrade.
Miss, you're mistaken.
You a burglar? I may be female...
but I'm not helpless. 
What do you want?
How shall I put it?
Let's have it.
I'll tell you the whole story.
Somehow, the other day my son 
made 50 yuan.
Yesterday, the woman in there
left lipstick on his cheek.
I heard a violin being played in 
this apartment.
You're Xiaochun's father?
I'm the one who gave him the money.
I live here. The lipstick traces were mine.
You object?
Xiaochun reporting!
I found two sweaters in a basin 
under the bed.
They're disgusting.
All moth-eaten and faded.
Why did you cage them up?
You fascist.
Easy.
You put dirty clothes on the piano...
of all places!
Your father pays me to teach you the violin.
Not to clean or do my household chores.
Go on. Play.
I'm unhappy.
Therefore, I can't play. 
You said so yourself.
Why are you unhappy?
You rearrange all my stuff.
I can't find a thing.
I've barely objected so far,
but you're unhappy.
I don't like playing in a pigsty.
You never change your clothes.
You live to pick fights.
You smell worse than your house pets.
They're not "house pets."
I rescued all my cats from the street.
Without me, they'd have starved
or frozen to death.
Liu Xiaochun, you're not so special.
Why, you...
You're just...
a stray cat I took in. You know that?
A cat who happens to play a violin. 
Big deal.
You're nothing exceptional.
And you say I smell like my animals.
Stop tapping. Sit up straight.
You never admit your mistakes.
If you'd been less proud...
your classmate wouldn't have married 
your rival.
Get out.
You hear me?
That's right, clear out!
If you leave now, you needn't return.
Chun, where you going?
Back home.
Why the long face?
Let's go out. My treat.
Your dad came by.
I thought he was a burglar.
I pulled this out.
He was so scared, he almost passed out.
I could use it for self-defense.
The curse of a pretty face.
All Beijing knows it's a cigarette lighter.
Your dad's a country bumpkin.
His red hat screamed "peasant."
He hid his money in it...
and got himself robbed.
Great strategy, huh?
Big sister, are you very rich?
I work hard for my dough and blow 
it on clothes.
You never mention your mother.
She left when I was two.
She left me this violin.
No wonder you play so well.
So your dad raised you.
Must have been hard. 
The peasant did okay.
Am I too "peasant"?
No, you're cool.
Over here.
I'm beat.
Coffee now. We'll eat later.
What will it be? Ice cream?
What are you staring at?
How about pastry?
That's your phone.
- Be right back.
- Answer it here.
Don't mind me.
Who's calling?
Hello?
Hello there.
What's with "hello there"?
Where are you?
I'm talking business.
Who with?
A promising contact.
Male or female?
Like me.
Say you love me.
Say it in Chinese.
Yes, that's right.
Hello?
I can't hear you.
Dad!
Darling.
So, you're talking business?
Nice female client.
Ever so attractive.
Pricey jewelry she's got there.
She's the one you hope will cough up
some money.
Sit!
Keep chatting.
Honey, I'll go home and start dinner.
You still here?
All men are jerks! Get lost.
Goodbye. Come again.
Come on.
Straight ahead.
Excuse me, is this the way in?
Thank you all.
I'd like to introduce my esteemed teacher.
I am here thanks to him.
I owe him everything. Professor Yu Shifeng.
How many big-ticket concerts in 12 months?
Sure, they applaud.
The welcome is warm.
But it's not for your playing.
It's for your reputation.
And now I'm part of your show, too.
You're a big boy now.
I can't scold you anymore.
Or give you a good kick.
Where will it all lead?
I sense the danger in too much, too soon.
To truly succeed as a musician...
Forget it. I'll shut up.
I've said too much already.
Let's not keep the press waiting.
Go ahead.
Your dad wants me to teach you violin...
He paid you to.
How rude!
You're a very rude boy.
Liu Cheng.
Professor Jiang.
Is class over?
What's all this?
Chun offended you, didn't he?
It's a token gesture.
Chun.
Go down the street and buy us a bottle.
If we finish this one, that's a start.
Have a seat!
How good a musician is Chun?
He's not bad.
Does he have a future or not?
That depends.
Do you seek fame and fortune...
or consummate musicianship?
Fame and fortune.
I can't guarantee it.
In that case, we quit.
Suit yourself.
Professor Jiang...
you're very understanding.
- How so?
- You're a fine man.
I was afraid you'd be insulted.
Your open mind disarms me.
True, such a trifling matter couldn't affect...
What are you insinuating?
Come clean. What's this about?
Are you firing me?
Liu Cheng, you're a regular bastard.
You set out to trick me, didn't you?
Drop this nonsense.
Is this about money?
I don't want money. Not anymore.
In that case...
Professor Jiang...
I'll tell you the truth.
I want Xiaochun...
to change teachers.
Out of my sight!
Sulk all you want.
But it's settled. 
You're changing teachers.
Uh, Mister...
- Professor Yu!
- Who?
Professor Yu!
What is it?
Hello, Professor.
- Ever hear of a doorbell?
- What bell?
Professor, I was at Mr. Tang Rong's recital.
Do you remember me?
- You have company?
- No.
That's my pupil I'm teaching.
Please forgive my intrusion.
But I have something vital to tell you.
May I see you alone?
Of course, Mrs. Yu may stay.
Okay, I'm all ears.
I wish to tell you...
about a violin prodigy.
This genius...
is my son.
A strange path led him to the violin.
So, your son's a genius?
Well, that's a secret.
I'll tell you the whole story.
Well...
Come in!
We've got some catching up to do...
you and I.
Let's begin.
Take care. Bring him to us soon.
See you, Professor.
Goodbye.
He really got to you.
We often see folks like him.
A touching tale!
You truly play well.
Liu Xiaochun...
our lessons together...
end here.
The first time I saw you, I figured...
you'd never make it.
I saw your potential...
but doubted...
that destiny would smile upon...
a country boy with no connections.
Your father's right.
I can teach you violin...
but not lead you to acclaim.
Study hard with Professor Yu.
He's a good teacher.
Return this money to your dad.
I've written my phone number.
Call me sometime.
DONGDAN STRINGED INSTRUMENTS
Well, well. You!
If it isn't my son.
Little devil.
You put me in a real bind last time.
Is Lili home?
She's not here.
Two guys seek Lili. 
I, however, have a key.
Why are you here?
And you?
Give her that.
Hey, kid!
You're pleased with yourself. 
What gives?
Take off my glasses and get out.
Nice hairdo.
Darling.
Hands off.
Open it.
How did you know I tried it on?
Top secret. I can't say.
You followed me?
Followed?
Glasses off!
Look me in the eye.
Answer me!
Nothing elaborate.
You really followed me?
Yes.
All right, then.
That woman at the café...
you told her your dirty jokes?
Who was she?
Out with it!
My new policy...
is to talk business...
only with men.
I was eyeing her shop.
But I'm low on funds.
Don't be angry.
Help me put it on.
Like it?
Obviously.
Sell it!
It stirs up bad memories.
You just said you need money.
How much?
27,000.
That's what it cost. Go return it.
Professor Yu.
I kept my shoes on last time.
I felt foolish as I left.
Come in.
- So you're Liu Xiaochun?
- Yes.
Play a piece you like.
Xiaochun, play the Wieniawsky concerto
for the professor.
Where's the violin?
I sold it.
Don't joke!
It's true.
Where's the money?
I spent it.
What is this?
Professor Yu.
I don't know what's going on.
Where is the violin?
Professor, I wouldn't dare lie to you.
Truly, he does play the violin.
And rather well.
Perhaps you could loan him one...
and he'll show you.
Sit down.
Lin Yu!
Bring us your violin.
Play something.
I don't know how.
Oh, yes, you do.
I can see by your hands.
Lin Yu, loan him yours.
I won't play here.
Where did you sell it?
Speak up! Where?
Dongdan's shop.
Who told you to sell it?
See what you've done?
Look here. You call this sheet music?
You think I'm an idiot?
It's full of pictures of bad women!
And this stuff. 
What have you glued in here?
Who said to sell it?
Sell everything! Why don't you?
The first prize...
and all the rest. You're unworthy.
They said you were the best.
All these prizes!
Worthless boy.
And here. You've put up a picture
of the bitch upstairs.
What were you thinking?
A violin, sir?
It's an ordinary one.
And you want 50,000?
Somebody cheated you.
We didn't pay that.
We add a profit margin to earn a living.
- Who's banging?
- Me.
- Who?
- Something's happened.
Why, it's Xiaochun's dad.
Am I your type?
Come out here!
Why should I? Tell me.
Come out here, then I'll tell you.
Something serious has happened.
I wouldn't make this up.
Stop shouting and listen.
If Chun bought the coat, I'll pay you back.
Tell her about the coat.
Tell your big sister everything. Is it true?
The number you've dialed is 
out-of-service.
It wasn't easy to find him a teacher.
Mr. Yu of the Conservatory.
What an insult...
to show up with an empty case.
The way things are going...
Xiaochun's future is shot.
The violin. How much?
50,000.
Fanny?
It's me.
How much cash you got?
I'll fill you in later. A rotten break.
Help me out, it's urgent.
I'll repay you fast.
10,000 yuan?
I'll take it. Thanks.
For tomorrow. 
I'll have to find the rest.
Mr. Han? It's Lili.
Lili! You have some nerve phoning me.
You found a guy richer than me?
You stood me up. I waited three hours.
If an employee is three minutes late...
I fire him on the spot.
I'm not your employee.
Don't take that tone with me!
Your money is no excuse!
I was 14 the first time I heard this.
I was in high school.
Phonographs were rare.
I had a classmate whose father went abroad.
He brought back Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
We were young.
We hid in order to listen.
Outside it rained. We were entranced.
It was like...
How shall I put it?
A sort of secret.
A pact between us and the music.
Music was our first love.
It was a magnificent feeling.
You, there!
I can't talk, Fanny. I'll call you back.
Out!
Get out!
Professor Yu!
You again.
I lost my temper earlier. I apologize.
Sorry.
I didn't come for your course...
but for a child.
I screwed up. I destroyed a genius.
Only you can help me.
A father and his son came to see you.
- I'm not taking any students.
- Wait!
It's all my fault.
He sold his violin to buy me a coat.
Nobody's ever been that nice to me.
And I wrecked his future.
This way, Professor.
Professor.
Please come in.
- Miss Lili brought me.
- Sit down.
What you want doesn't count.
Now play and absolve me of my crime.
Here.
It seems I've ruined his future.
Play!
Miss Lili, truly...
I thank you deeply.
As soon as I saw you...
I knew you were a good soul.
Knock it off.
I knew right away you were rotten.
How true.
We're even now.
Whether Yu accepts him or not is 
up to fate.
Agreed.
Who's your teacher?
You won't say?
No matter.
You play from the heart.
That's good.
Who did you sell your violin to?
Dongdan's shop.
You're gutsy. I'd not have dared.
Character pleases me.
You've got peach fuzz.
Want to be my pupil?
Every note is in place, but it's no use.
There's no feeling when you play.
Music devoid of feeling is like
an empty gun.
Without bullets, how can you hit a target...
or conquer a listener?
Feelings can't be taught.
Technique, yes.
But feelings are up to you.
Class dismissed.
Come here, Liu Xiaochun.
I'd like you to meet Lin Yu.
This is Xiaochun. Shake hands.
We've met.
I'll soon pick a pupil
for the international contest.
Your chances are equal, so study hard.
But you already chose me.
I'll decide at the last minute.
Go!
Liu Xiaochun, that's great!
An international competition.
So begins our first lesson.
Seems dark?
Get used to it.
Learn to embrace it.
The stage is blinding.
When you play, the audience vanishes.
The light is in your heart.
Heaven, too, is dark.
Only the angels glow.
You, too, are an angel, for you 
possess music.
Your violin is a weapon.
Your feelings are bullets.
You must conquer.
You must conquer through music.
I've chosen your piece.
It's perfect for you.
It's difficult.
Tchaikovsky's Concerto in D Major.
This is a precious violin.
It's over 200 years old.
Starting today, it's in your care.
Begin.
That's better.
The shotgun's become a sleek rifle.
I barely recognize you.
Professor Yu.
Liu Cheng, it's you.
I've come to get Chun.
Liu Cheng...
I've discussed it with Chun...
- Some water.
- Thank you.
To facilitate matters...
starting today...
Chun will live here with me.
From the professor...
to buy yourself an outfit.
I have something to tell you.
I went to Dongdan's shop.
Somebody bought our violin.
No big deal.
It had seen better days.
A change was in order.
Pay close attention to Mr. Yu.
This is my sink.
Yours is the other one.
Peasant!
30, 40, 50 thousand.
It's all there. Every last cent.
They sold the violin.
So I don't need the cash.
Who's the bastard who bought it?
Let's drop it!
And you can knit.
You're something, Liu Cheng.
It was an old sweater of Xiaochun's.
I undid it to knit him another.
Chun is lucky to have a dad like you.
Give me that.
The professor wants
to keep Xiaochun with him.
I should be pleased.
So why don't I feel good about it?
He's your flesh and blood,
not some kid you found.
He's your son, no matter what.
That's true.
It's me.
I wanted to see you.
Come in.
Lili bought you this coat. Try it on.
I wanted to see you...
to talk to you about something.
It's good that you're living here with Mr. Yu.
I'm thinking of heading home.
I'll earn the cash to send you abroad
to compete.
What do you say?
Have some fruit juice.
Thanks.
Here.
It's a last-minute thing...
as to who will get to compete.
Bye!
That's good.
Why are you stopping?
Professor...
I don't want to compete.
My dad's leaving.
I want to go with him.
He won't agree.
He dreams of your success.
Stay and play well...
for his sake.
I think my playing is worse.
True enough.
You've developed Lin Yu's failing.
This is about expressing gratitude.
I see no gratefulness in you.
How to put you in touch with the sensation?
Let's say...
Take an example.
For example...
For example...
Liu Cheng is not your real father.
He found you in a train station...
with a violin beside you.
So Liu Cheng assumed...
whoever left you there...
wanted you to play the violin.
If your parents abandoned you...
for a shameful reason...
Liu Cheng never blamed them.
He was very happy to have you.
He hopes you will succeed...
because that way...
upon learning the truth...
you'd overcome the humiliation.
That's how he raised you.
Don't you think you owe it to him to excel?
It's a pack of lies!
Liu Xiaochun!
What's the matter?
Tell me what happened.
Don't cry.
I miss you.
What's wrong?
Did your teacher mistreat you?
I shouldn't have made you angry.
I shouldn't have sold the violin.
I didn't listen to you.
I was wrong to disobey.
I have my flaws, too. No matter.
I want to quit.
I want to go home with you.
My boy.
Professor.
Come in, Professor.
Let me talk to him.
I know you're angry at me.
I regret revealing the secret.
I so desire your success...
for your father's sake.
Put on your coat. Come back.
The choice is yours.
Liu Cheng, come in.
Why the big box?
It's some of Chun's things I'd like 
you to keep.
I head home tomorrow.
But there's the competition.
What's your hurry?
Sit down.
What's going on?
If I attend, I'm afraid...
I'll distract Chun.
I have stage fright, too.
One more thing.
He'll need money to travel abroad.
I've got to go home and earn some.
The 50,000 yuan. 
I set them aside for you.
It's enough for a while.
I can borrow more.
Take it.
For a young girl like you...
life can't be easy.
I can't accept.
If you find the time...
please look in on Chun.
He's still just a boy.
And I suppose you're a man?
No need to get all weepy.
You didn't knit this.
Lili helped me.
Looks good on you.
It does.
Help me pack?
Dad, are you taking that home again?
We brought it along to make gifts.
Who knew we'd find a teacher so fast?
I'll make a comforter and bring it to you.
Aren't we lucky!
Finding a teacher as good as Yu so quickly.
We made a great leap forward.
Big competition coming up.
We've been living here a while.
It's hard to leave.
True.
At first we even slept at the public baths.
I had my red hat.
Then I lost it.
And your slogan to comfort me?
"Admit your mistake!"
Were we right to switch teachers?
Yes.
It was hard to leave Professor Jiang...
and his cats.
Hush now.
I know.
Dad!
You must come hear me play.
You'll go right after.
Sonny...
I'm no good under pressure.
I might even faint.
Time to say goodbye. I'll be back soon.
Behave yourself.
On your way.
Away you go!
Aren't you gone yet?
Are you rejecting me?
Professor Jiang? It's Liu Cheng.
Xiaochun's dad.
Hello. I wanted to tell you...
I'm heading home.
Chun isn't leaving.
He lives with Professor Yu.
We met many good people in Beijing.
We were lucky.
I wanted to thank you.
Many thanks.
I've made up my mind.
For tonight's competition...
I've chosen Xiaochun.
Give me your glass.
Lin Yu...
keep working hard.
There will be other opportunities.
A ticket to leave town.
It's best that you take a train home...
after tonight's concert.
We'll serve ourselves.
Yesterday afternoon, the rehearsal 
went well.
But you know Chun.
How to put it?
When you're around, I'm uneasy.
I understand.
I already bought my seat...
for tonight's train.
I'm not going to the concert.
Out of my way!
I'm sick of this!
Lin Yu.
I really thought you'd be the one
to play tonight.
Yeah, right.
Don't pretend to pity me.
I'm leaving, but first...
come see something.
Go on, open it.
Open it up!
Hard to believe, huh?
While you and your dad mourned 
its loss...
it was right here in a drawer.
Know why he bought it?
So long as this existed, your heart 
eluded him.
If you triumphed, he'd give it back to you...
making a fuss over all the trouble
he'd gone to.
But if you didn't turn into a prize pupil...
this would be gone for good.
My playing lacks feeling.
Has he shown me feeling?
He says it can't be given.
Because he has none to give.
Liu Xiaochun.
I thought I didn't care.
But when he said I wouldn't play tonight...
I realized just how much I truly love music.
I know.
Xiaochun!
Dad!
Chun!
Whose baby is this?
Whose baby is this?
Whose baby is this?
Did someone lose a child?
