- Yes?
- It's Rolex.
To see Papa Sanou.
ONLY THE ANIMALS
Hi there, you.
Ah! You OK?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Forgot I was coming?
No.
Let's look at this inside.
Yeah.
Here.
OK...
Check it over and sign.
You need to get up to date
on hygiene monitoring.
Did you fix a date?
Not yet.
You have to.
Don't waste time.
What?
Remember what you said
the first day I came here?
"I only talk to the animals
and my dog."
It's true.
Oh, yeah?
I love your hands.
I love it when you touch me.
Joseph...
You weren't really with me today.
The same anxieties?
Is that it?
Have the noises come back?
I need to be alone.
I need to be alone.
Don't say that.
We do each other good.
You seem better to me anyhow.
This low-pressure zone
in place over central France
is bringing heavy snow...
Michel, are you eating with me?
- I'm busy with the accounts.
- OK.
Last night, a violent blizzard
struck the Causse plateau,
leaving many homes
without power even now.
For now, police efforts are focused
on a missing woman
whose car was found abandoned
at the side of the road.
So far, there are no leads.
Here.
- It's ossobuco.
- Thanks.
I had to draw on our joint account.
Mercier wanted a deposit for the shed.
Hadn't you already paid?
No, that was the pump.
A woman is missing.
- Really? Where?
- On the plateau.
I saw her car.
Were you up there?
Yes, for my rounds.
I'll leave you.
- Good evening, Dad.
- Hi.
Ossobuco. Shall I warm it?
All right.
Is he managing?
"He" has a name.
He's called Michel.
- Your pills.
- Thanks.
Do you still fuck?
Stop that, Dad.
Meaning you don't.
It's none of your business.
No, you don't understand.
Let me explain.
Mrs Calvet called the surgery
to learn Mrs Lojewski is on sick leave,
with no replacement,
and they don't know
when she'll be back.
- Is that right?
- Yes.
No, don't see what you can do,
find someone to take over.
All right.
I'm counting on you. Call me.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Well...
We'll manage it.
I won't back off.
You're sweet.
- It's good to be optimistic.
- Yes.
Necessary, I'd say.
Do you love your husband?
Yes, of course.
You're safe, then.
That woman who's missing,
she didn't love her husband
and he didn't love her.
When you love,
nothing can happen to you.
Nothing.
The search is complicated
by the amount of snow
and the driving winds.
There is no news yet
of the missing Parisian woman
whose car was found abandoned.
She has been named as Evelyne Ducat,
who has a holiday home
in a renovated local sheep farm.
Her husband, Guillaume Ducat,
was away when she disappeared.
He was travelling abroad.
He has just returned and gave us
this statement.
I can't explain it.
Evelyne is independent,
but not rash.
We don't always
tell each other everything we do.
But it has been 48 hours,
and I'm starting to worry.
It's freezing out.
- Is it a bad time?
- No.
- Do you want a coffee?
- I wouldn't say no.
This weather's something else.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- It's hot.
- I've just made it.
- You wanted something?
- Yes.
Between you and me,
the Evelyne Ducat thing...
- We're getting nowhere.
- Ah.
If she were lost in the storm,
we'd have found her body.
What are you thinking?
You see a lot of people.
Maybe you heard things
that could help.
Nothing precise. Rumours.
Such as?
Just senseless gossip.
OK.
Know Joseph Bonnefille?
Yes.
He's insured by us.
I saw him earlier.
He's a bit of a loner.
Do you know him well?
Not that well.
I've handled his file
for a few months.
Losing his mother shook him up.
- Do you suspect him?
- No, no.
I'm just curious.
- OK?
- Hi.
Just checking on you.
I wondered if you two saw anything
during the storm.
We're still looking
for Guillaume Ducat's wife.
I have no time for that.
OK...
I guess I'll be going.
See you.
Bye.
You have no time for it either.
Why do you say that?
Your round keeps you busy.
What do you mean?
Cheat on me all you like
with your dropout.
But don't come crying to me after.
Joseph?
Joseph?
Joseph!
Joseph?
What are you after?
You scared me.
But...
What happened to your dog?
Someone shot him.
Who?
No idea.
Are you OK?
Joseph?
What's wrong?
You can talk to me.
Why have you come?
Because...
I love you.
I'm not interested.
I don't believe you.
What have you done?
Joseph, you can talk to me.
I can listen.
Get out.
Get the hell out!
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
Hold on, I don't get it.
Will you press charges?
No, I won't press charges.
Get off my back!
Who was that?
Press charges against who?
Michel...
Talk to me.
Michel...
Michel.
Come with me.
Come inside.
Did Joseph do this?
Did you fight?
Did you kill his dog?
Did you, Michel?
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Where's your husband?
No idea. With the animals.
The hell he is.
They haven't been fed.
He thinks life is a holiday?
I'll feed them.
Goddamn layabout!
Dad! Stop it!
You can't exert yourself.
Get off my back.
Cédric, can you come here, please?
I had an affair with Joseph.
At first, I just wanted to help.
I wanted to revive him.
Give him gentleness
and pleasure.
I didn't feel I was in love with him.
But you were.
Yes.
Michel killed Joseph's dog.
They fought.
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.
That's Michel's car.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Michel!
Michel!
Michel!
What's wrong?
What, boy?
Shit...
Hi there, you.
Ah! Are you OK?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Did you forget I was coming?
Shit.
What do you want from me?
Hello.
- Mr Bonnefille?
- Yes.
Major Vigier, gendarmerie.
Sorry, this won't take long.
A woman has gone missing.
You must know her -
the wife of Guillaume Ducat, Evelyne Ducat.
I don't know her.
And her husband?
Neither.
She'd been here a few days.
Perhaps you saw her?
No.
All right.
What's with your dog?
He's hungry.
I'm hungry, too,
but I don't bark like that.
All right.
I'll go now, Mr Bonnefille.
Come here, boy.
Listen to me.
You mustn't bark like that.
Get it? Huh?
Get it?
Go on, get in the house.
They're looking for you.
I'll stay with you.
I don't hear the noises here.
Thirty-four.
News of the missing woman?
Not that I know.
Let go of her! Get away!
Get away, I said!
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
You're leaving
No, my love, it's nothing
Just a few weeks to wait
You're leaving
My joys, my dreams are for you
There can be no doubt about that
You're leaving
Like a sun that vanishes
Like a summer, like a Sunday
I fear the winter and the cold
I fear the emptiness
The absence
You're leaving
And the birds aren't singing anymore
The world is only indifference
You're the last one.
Yes.
They're all dead.
Yes.
Tell me about it.
Last summer,
- when my mother died...
- Yes?
I couldn't face calling anyone.
You left her in her bed?
Yes.
- For a long time?
- Yes, a long time.
Until she began to rot?
Yes, until she began to rot.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter a bit.
Joseph!
- What are you after?
- You scared me.
But...
What happened to your dog?
Someone shot him.
You can't stay here anymore.
Goodbye.
See you soon.
Table 11.
- Did you like it?
- Very much.
I chose well, then.
Yes.
It was delicious.
In Sète.
I told you.
I don't know. A couple of days.
Yes, I'll go to La Palière.
All right.
Me too.
Who was it?
You're a curious little monkey.
- You won't tell me?
- My husband.
Are you shocked?
No, I'm not shocked.
But it's a pity.
A pity for whom?
For you or for me?
For us.
Well, for everyone.
Even for him.
If it helps,
I don't think he cares.
I love your kisses.
- A turnover, two swordfish.
- OK.
Little monkey, I hate goodbyes.
Next time in Sète, I'll get dessert.
Michel, what's wrong with you?
Arsehole!
Hi.
Hello.
How's it going?
OK. How did you find me?
You mentioned this place.
It's well hidden.
That was the idea.
Is this a bad time?
You're not alone?
Actually, I am.
I just wasn't expecting you.
Put your bag down.
I have a present for you.
It's ugly.
But nice.
Like me.
Who said you were nice?
I feel we could live slotted together.
Slotted together?
Don't laugh, I'm serious.
This kind of thing
only happens once in a lifetime.
As soon as I saw you, I felt it.
I adore you.
Don't talk to me
as if I was still a kid.
- You are almost.
- No.
Marion...
I'm twenty years older than you.
Age doesn't matter.
It does matter.
It's in your mind.
What's in your mind
is thinking it doesn't matter.
Marion...
What?
I'd rather you didn't sleep here.
It's Guillaume's house after all.
Here.
It's a bit basic,
but it's the only one open in winter.
What are you doing?
To pay for a room.
Are you crazy?
It's nothing. I feel guilty
for not letting you sleep over.
So let's go back to yours.
Go on, take it.
I'd rather you feel guilty.
As you want.
Can I help you?
Do you have cheaper rooms?
The prices are all there, Miss.
It's closed.
Please, I'm cold.
This is all I can offer.
I can't open the trailers.
It'll do.
I opted for the campsite.
I'd rather be with you!
Stop!
What?
Enough of this.
I'm cold.
I ache all over,
I slept badly.
You should've taken the money.
No, you should've
let me sleep at yours.
Why own a dog
if you love being alone?
I'm company for him.
I didn't want a pet.
But he insisted.
He followed me on a beach
and never left.
Adopt me.
I'd like to keep things light.
You find me heavy?
I find you irresistible,
but a bit too...
Too?
I don't know... Too much.
I have no idea
what "too much" means.
Your husband?
Yes.
- I wish he'd die.
- Stop it.
I'll curse him.
He'll get sick.
Stop it!
Yes?
There's someone outside.
What do you mean?
Someone peeping through the window.
You're imagining things.
Just go to sleep now.
I miss you.
I can't really talk now.
Come and fetch me.
Actually, Guillaume just got here.
I can't see you now.
When does he leave?
I don't know exactly.
I'll be in touch.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Evelyne, stop it,
I don't want money, I want you!
Shit!
Get back in the car!
Fantomas, get back in!
Come in.
Here's my little caravan.
Has your husband left?
Yes.
Actually, he wasn't here.
What?
I lied. He wasn't here.
I don't understand.
I prefer to be alone.
You prefer to be alone?
We'll stop seeing each other.
No.
Certainly not.
Yes, you're young -
you have your whole life ahead of you.
Stop it!
I want to be with you.
- Let me speak.
- Don't try to fool me.
Just let me speak!
I'm fond of you, Marion,
but I don't love you.
Not true.
It's not my fault.
I enjoy the sex, but it ends here.
Stop it!
I can't give what you want.
- I want nothing.
- You want a lot. Listen...
No, you listen.
This is freaking you out.
You don't prefer to be alone.
No one does. It's just...
you're scared.
You're scared of loving.
And, above all, of being loved.
But that's OK, I don't care.
I love you enough for two.
I can love you enough for ten.
I'll give you everything.
I'll make you happy.
Don't you want to be?
Stop!
Stop!
Here's money for your trip home.
Fuck you and your money!
What do you think I am?
A whore?
You disgust me!
You really disgust me.
Miss?
Miss?
Miss? Can you hear me?
Miss...
Can you get up?
Cédric Vigier, gendarmerie.
Did you take something?
Drugs? Pills?
Look at me, please.
I came to ask you
about Evelyne Ducat.
She's missing.
When did you last see her?
I forget...
The night of the storm.
- Where?
- Here.
She came to the campsite?
Yes.
And?
We made love.
And after?
After, she left.
You left it at that?
How do you mean?
Did you arrange to meet again?
The next day, say.
No, nothing was settled.
You weren't worried
not to hear from her?
No, we were free.
Why not say she left you?
The janitor heard you arguing.
You hide away here...
She ended it, right?
What's all this money?
She gave it to me to go away.
What's happened to her?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Who is it?
It's me.
Who's me?
I need you to explain.
Who are you?
The guy who called earlier...
He wasn't a cop, it's a joke.
I don't understand.
Amandine...
I don't understand.
You're so beautiful.
- Let go of me!
- It's me.
Get lost!
We'll go away together.
- Amandine...
- Get lost!
Amandine...
Get the hell out!
Get lost, bastard.
I don't want to see you!
Get lost!
Abidjan-Paris!
Hey, it's a small fish.
You're taking too much.
There's not enough atchéké.
Leave some for others.
Rolex! Rolex!
He's made a lot.
Don't you recognise him?
He's Rolex the Bourgeois.
He got a real pigeon.
He hit the jackpot.
Even his sheep eats lettuce.
It's true he's made a lot.
But he did a bad thing.
What did he do?
A human sacrifice, a real zamou.
What?
- It's true.
- That's bullshit.
You never believe me.
But I don't lie.
Remember Navarro Big Bucks?
He saw Papa Sanou, too.
His pigeons coughed up big time.
Where is he now?
Dead and buried! Bad deal.
Better rich for a day
than a slave all your life.
Hey, thief, you scam from dawn?
- I collect the colonial debt.
- Scam and come back broke.
Get lost.
That one.
Beautiful and natural.
True.
Totally.
Her name's Angelina More.
Angelina More always wants more.
- Got stuff?
- Photos, videos...
For a good price, as a buddy.
With her, you'll hook rich fish
and earn loads of money.
I'll take her.
Your Angelina
will be my Amandine.
Are you there?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Seeing to my animals.
I like that you work with animals.
I love animals.
It's a lot of work.
Is Amandine your real name?
Yes.
I don't like lies.
Neither do I.
But Zorro's not your real name.
No.
What's your real name?
Michel.
Send me a photo of you?
All right.
You're very pretty.
That was at Christmas.
Send me a photo of you?
You're a pretty pigeon, too.
I'm here to see Papa Sanou.
Wait here.
Follow me.
Sit down.
Hello, Papa Sanou.
I want to hook a pigeon,
get lucky and make lots of money.
I know.
The photo.
You have a photo of the bait?
You're lucky. She's beautiful.
It's not luck.
I chose her well,
bought photos, videos...
- It's chance.
- Not even.
Shut up!
What do you know of spirits?
Chance is stronger than you, idiot!
What's her name?
For my pigeon, Amandine.
Amandine.
Do you know what love is?
- Yes.
- No.
You don't know.
Love is giving what you don't have.
- You understand?
- Yes.
Giving what you have
means having fun.
Love is giving what you don't have.
Repeat.
Love is giving what you don't have.
Are you ready to give
what you don't have?
Fill your mouth.
Go on, fill it.
Spit on the photos.
Your white man wants you.
He needs all your love.
Yes.
What you ask, he'll give you.
And your fortune will grow.
Thank you, Papa Sanou.
You'll thank me later.
Listen to me carefully.
When your white man coughs up,
come back to give the spirits
their share.
You understand?
Yes, I understand.
How are you, sweetheart?
Not great.
Why?
My dad has died.
I'm sorry.
He worked in Abidjan.
He had a heart attack.
I must go there.
When do you go?
I don't know.
I have no money for the flight.
I don't know what to do.
I cry all the time.
How much do you need?
A bite!
I got a bite!
Is 1,000 euros good?
Almost 1,000 euros.
The bank won't give me a loan.
The bank won't give me a loan.
I can help if you want.
It's working!
It's working.
Pay me back later.
You're too kind.
Too, too kind.
I'm happy to help.
Darling,
as a way to thank you,
I'm going to send you something.
A little video.
He'll be wanking all night.
Hi there.
I'm going to Mende tomorrow.
OK.
Excuse me.
- Do you sell PCS coupons?
- Yes.
I need 1,000 euros worth.
Money, money...
I've never seen so much money.
The General!
Check out the General's style!
Smart dressers, too!
Everyone feeling good?
Everyone?
Hello and welcome
to Abidjan’s most exclusive party!
Tonight's sponsor is General CFA,
the most generous of generals.
General CFA!
Mr Prestige in person!
Check his look.
Check his pants.
Yes, General.
He's going to stand.
General CFA!
Check his moves!
Hey! Cut, cut, cut!
Here's the cut!
He's going to town!
CFA! General CFA.
The man for whom the CFA
has no secrets.
General CFA!
Show your stuff!
The cash dispenser!
The money! The moves! The moment!
Hands in the air!
Praise the guy!
Mr NMW.
No Money Worries!
General CFA!
The fan! The fan...!
CFA storm!
Money storm!
It's Monique.
- What?
- Monique, look.
She's even more beautiful.
Go and see her.
Go on.
Get up!
The General.
Monique.
Monique.
It's been ages.
It's been ages.
Is this your place?
Yes.
You won the lottery or what?
Stop staring.
You look like a fish.
Seriously, tell me.
He's French.
He invested in mining.
- A French guy?
- Yes.
He's OK, he leaves me in peace.
I just have to be with him
when he comes on business.
And Flore?
He's kind to her.
Can I see her?
You can look at her,
but don't wake her.
OK.
She's very pretty.
She's my treasure.
I think she has my nose.
No. I hope not.
Come on.
Can I tell you a secret?
Yes...
of course, my love.
I've put money aside
for years, to go away one day.
Your wife says nothing?
She doesn't know.
She doesn't know...
You don't love her.
You don't love her anymore?
It's you I love.
Oh, my darling!
I want your touch.
All over. My breasts. My bum.
You like my breasts?
Yes.
And my bum?
Yes.
Want to fuck it?
Yes.
Say it.
Go on, say it.
I want to fuck it.
Coming to eat?
Not yet, I'm on the accounts.
I'll bring your meal?
Later.
I have a gift for you, too.
Close your eyes.
OK. Open them now.
You're crazy.
Look, there's a diamond.
A real one.
It's beautiful.
It must've cost a fortune.
Yes.
All I've ever made.
All of it.
I didn't even throw a party.
- Armand...
- Yes?
I won't leave my white guy,
not for you or anyone.
Don't go imagining things.
I'm imagining nothing.
I'll offer you more than him.
A big house,
the best schools for Flore.
I'll prove it, trust me.
They beat me. They stole my money
and my debit card.
Come back to France.
You can't stay there.
Come and see me.
At your place?
Yes.
I'll send you money.
Thank you, darling.
I love you.
I'll be waiting.
Chance is greater than you.
What did they say?
It's pressure.
I'm not surprised.
You're stressed.
It's not stress,
it's my blood pressure.
You can be calm
and have high pressure.
It's the heart.
The heart and nerves
are all linked.
It's true.
Look...
We can pick her up.
Michel, what's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Are you crazy?
The poor thing.
Honestly...
- It's OK.
- That's so mean.
I saw you.
You came here.
I couldn't stop.
I was with my wife.
What does he mean?
It was a shock seeing you.
Your guy's nuts.
He believes so much in your love,
he sees Amandine for real.
It was you, wasn't it?
What do I tell him?
It's screwed.
Just say goodbye.
No. I'm not saying goodbye.
Yes, it was me.
Where are you?
At the hotel?
I don't know where she is!
How can I know?
I want to see you.
No, be patient.
Not yet. You must be patient.
I'll explain.
I love you.
How'll you get him
to send you money now?
Your luck is gone, bro.
Speak.
It's the zamou.
Luck has abandoned me.
I've lost the zamou.
Something's blocking it?
Yes.
- And you know why.
- Yes.
Say it.
I forgot to come back.
You forgot to come back.
-Yes.
- Because you earned so well.
Yes.
You spent it all.
And you forgot the spirits.
Yes.
Ask for forgiveness.
- Forgive me.
- On your knees!
Forgive me, Papa Sanou.
It'll be 4,000 euros.
What? 4,000 euros?
I have to confess something.
I saw you in town and followed you.
I know you're at the campsite.
I scared you.
It was me watching you.
You're so pretty.
Did you find the money?
The 500 euros in the envelope.
Did you find it?
Yes.
But I need much more.
Why?
There are people I owe money to.
How much do you owe them?
How much?
4,000 euros?
I need coupons, not envelopes.
I want to see you first.
That's too dangerous.
They're serious.
I don't care.
Too bad.
I want to see you.
Stop!
Stop!
Fuck you and your money!
What do you think I am?
A whore?
You disgust me!
You really disgust me.
What's wrong?
You like making others suffer?
What? Who are you?
I'm nobody.
I'm calling the police.
Deal with that.
He's working hard.
He's focused.
Look at his face.
He's an ugly bastard.
Look at his eyes.
Like roadkill.
- Are you there, sweetheart?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
I have solved your problem.
That woman won't threaten you again.
We can be together now.
We can be together now.
Are you Amandine?
Answer.
Are you Amandine?
Yes.
Well?
Didn't your parents teach you
to make an honest living?
They did.
So why do this?
The guys you scam,
do they deserve
to have their feelings mocked?
No.
We'll call your victim.
- Hello?
- Mr Michel Farange?
Yes.
This is Inspector Siako,
with the Abidjan cybercrime unit.
Yes?
Mr Farange,
have you been in touch
with an Amandine lately?
Why do you ask?
The girl doesn't exist.
I have the young scammer here.
His name's Armand.
I don't understand.
Mr Farange,
will you press charges?
No, I won't press charges.
Get off my back!
Who was that?
Press charges against who?
Michel...
Talk to me.
Michel.
Who is it?
It's me.
Who's me?
I need you to explain.
- Get lost!
- Amandine...
Get lost!
Get lost, bastard.
I don't want to see you!
Get lost!
Did Joseph do this?
Did you fight?
Did you kill his dog?
Did you, Michel?
Michel!
Michel!
Michel!
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.
- I'm looking for Armand.
- Who?
- Armand.
- Armand?
- Armand.
- There's no Armand here.
I told you,
there's no Armand here.
Armand?
Let people work.
There's no Armand here.
Armand?
There's no Armand.
Let people work, please.
- 109, please.
- Here you are, Monsieur.
Armand! Armand!
- Hello, Armand.
- Hello, Monique.
I was looking for you.
Your sister said you worked nearby.
I'm helping my uncle.
That's good.
I came to say goodbye.
You're leaving?
Flore and I are going to live in France.
I wanted to give this back.
Take it.
Sell it.
I know you're in trouble.
I'm not in trouble.
Keep it.
I chose it for you.
Take good care of Flore.
Hey.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, I did.
Haven't seen you in a while.
- That's why you called?
- Yes.
- I'll get to work.
- You work?
- Yes.
- Stay cool.
He's outside.
The guy in the grey T-shirt.
- Which one?
- The grey T-shirt.
You see him?
Recognise me?
You had a good laugh.
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
I didn't.
I'll pay you back.
I don't give a shit about the money!
Understand?
Screw the money!
Are you there?
Yes, my love.
