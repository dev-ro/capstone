[Crickets chirping]
[Caroline]
THANK YOU.
[Dog barking]
[Caroline] ANOTHER
2 MILES, HE SAYS.
THE ROAD TO JACKSON
IS JUST BEFORE THE NIOBA SIGN.
[Sound of chains]
[Footsteps]
AHH!
[Heavy breathing]
[Thunder]
STILL LOVE ME?
WHAT'LL YOU OFFER?
COME HERE.
OH, SHIT!

WELL, HANG ON.

I WILL.
I WON'T BE LONG, NOW.
[Dog barking]
[Caroline]
THOR.

[Barking]

[Mac]
OH, MY GOD.
[Eli] HELP ME.
GET HER OVER THERE.
COME ON, HURRY.
[Caroline moaning]
[Truck honks]
YOUR BOY IS SICKER
THAN WE KNOW.
THE IV'S ARE THE ONLY THING
SUSTAINING HIM AS IT IS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO SUPPLEMENT THAT
WITH A FULL COMPLEMENT
OF LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS,
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
ANY CHANCE TO SUSTAIN HIM.
"SUSTAINING."
"CHANCE."
I DON'T WANT
MY SON SUSTAINED.
AND I DON'T WANT ANY CHANCES.
I WANT HIM CURED.
[Caroline]
ELI.
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.
A MONTH AGO, HE WAS A HEALTHY,
.
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT, HAPPY KID
THERE'S A CHEMICAL
IMBALANCE,
AN OCCULT MALIGNANCY
IN HIS SYSTEM.
WHAT KIND OF MEDICINE
ARE YOU PRACTICING HERE, DOCTOR?
WHAT WE HAVE IS
A PITUITARY GLAND
THAT HAS GONE CRAZY,
OUT OF CONTROL.
IT'S CAUSING MUCH
TOO RAPID RATE OF GROWTH.
NO MATTER WHAT
NOURISHMENT WE GIVE HIM,
IT JUST ISN'T ENOUGH.
NOW, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE GENETIC, INHERITED.
BUT METABOLIC TESTS
THAT WE DID ON BOTH OF YOU
.
SHOW THAT YOU'RE NORMAL AS PIE
SO UNLESS THERE'S
SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW,
UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING
LEFT OUT OF THE PICTURE...
ELI.
NO.
NO. NO.
ELI, PLEASE.
ATLANTA OR
MAYBE HOUSTON...
FIRST THING
WE GOTTA DO
IS GET HIM THE HELL
OUT OF HERE
AND SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.
.
WE CAN'T JUST WISH IT AWAY
WE CAN'T JUST GO
ON PRETENDING
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
17 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ATTACKED
.
AND NOTHING'S EVER
GONNA CHANGE THAT FACT
HE...
HE IS MY SON.
HE IS MY OWN SON
AND NOBODY ELSE'S.
YES, HE IS YOUR SON.
YOU LOVE HIM
AND HE LOVES YOU.
AND WHATEVER WE FIND OUT
WON'T CHANGE THAT.
BUT MICHAEL IS DYING.
WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO
FIND OUT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE.
YOU HEARD WHAT
DR. ODOM SAID:
"SOMETHING MORE TO GO ON."
,
THAT MAN,
HIS BACKGROUND
.
HIS MEDICAL RECORDS,
MAY BE THAT SOMETHING MORE
NO! NO!
NO.
NO.
NO.
NO!
NO!
AAH!
NO!
NO!
NO--AAH!
[Slam]
YOU'RE LEAVING.
.
NO, SWEETHEART
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE LEAVING ME.
I'M JUST GOING WITH DADDY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
JUST WHERE WE THINK
WE CAN DO YOU BEST.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK, DARLING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT HERE.
BUT I'M AFRAID.
I'M DYING.
I DON'T WANT
TO BE LEFT ALONE.
NOBODY,
DADDY,
DR. ODOM OR ME
.
IS EVER GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN TO YOU
I'LL SEE YOU
REAL SOON, NOW.
[Sighs]
YOU OKAY?
I'M FINE.
WELL, THE FOG
IS ROLLING IN.
[Bird crowing]
[Dog barking]
[Dog barking]
[Dog barking]
[Eli]
WELL...
LOOKS PEACEFUL ENOUGH.
.
THERE'S THE COURTHOUSE
HI.
WELL, HI THERE,
YOURSELF.
UM... I'D LIKE TO GET
SOME INFORMATION.
.
HONEY, YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE
I'M JUST A FOUNT.
[Typewriter clicking]
?
YES, MA'AM
. MAY I HELP YOU
I'D LIKE TO LOOK THROUGH
YOUR BACK ISSUES, IF I COULD.
OH, WHY?
I'M FROM JACKSON,
THE EXTENSION SCHOOL.
?
IS THAT A FACT
I'M WRITING A BOOK
ON CRIME IN RURAL AMERICA.
.
THIS ISN'T JACKSON
. THIS ISN'T EVEN SHREVEPORT
THERE'S NO CRIME
AROUND HERE,
EXCEPTING AN OCCASIONAL
BARN BURNING.
YOU KNOW, STRICTLY LOCAL
STUFF TO BE EXACT.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'M LOOKING FOR.
SOMETHING TO GIVE ME
A FEEL OF THE AREA.
.
WELL, THE MORGUE'S IN THE BACK
IF YOU GOTTA FEEL OUT THE AREA
YOU ONLY GOT A FEW MINUTES.
IT'S NEAR LUNCHTIME.
AND I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY
TO MIND THE OFFICE
AND I'M NOT PUTTING
ANYBODY ON.
YOU HELP YOURSELF,
YOU HEAR?
JUDGE, MAYOR
AND SOMETIME THAT
PIG-HEADED SON OF A BITCH.
[Giggling]
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
THE CLERK OUTSIDE,
MRS. GUMFREY,
SAID YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HELP ME WITH AN ASSAULT THAT
HAPPENED HERE ABOUT
17 YEARS AGO.
WHAT KIND OF ASSAULT?
RAPE.
RAPE.
MAYBE...
IT WASN'T DESCRIBED THAT WAY.
I'M INTERESTED IN
ANY POSSIBLE
ACT OF VIOLENCE,
ANY
MEMORABLE BEHAVIOR.
I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T HELP YOU...MISTER?
MACCLEARY,
ELI MACCLEARY.
WELL, I HOPE
YOU WON'T HOLD
THE PEACEABLENESS
OF OUR LITTLE NIOBA
AGAINST YOU,
JUST THE SAME.
THANK YOU.
.
THANK YOU, SIR
[Typewriter clicking]
IT'S LUNCHTIME.
ALMOST.
HEY, MISSY, I SAID
IT WAS LUNCH.
COMING.
ELI!
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
[Edwin] BUT SHE RIPPED OUT
THAT WHOLE FRONT PAGE,
ALL ABOUT
LIONEL AND...
WHO'S THAT
WITH HER?
WELL, IF YOU WAS
TO GIVE ME ODDS,
I'D SAY IT WAS HER HUSBAND.
YOU DIDN'T TELL
HIM ANYTHING?
ALL RIGHT.
OH LORD, I BETTER GET AHOLD
OF DEXTER AND HORACE.
WE DON'T WANT THEM
FORGETTING THEMSELVES.
WE'RE REAL
SORRY, MA'AM.
THAT'S WHY
IT'S A SMALL TOWN.
YEAH, WE'LL
LOOK INTO IT.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING.
EXCUSE ME, UH...
SHERIFF BRAND?
POOL, BILL POOL.
SHERIFF BRAND
RETIRED IN '65.
WELL, COULD YOU TELL US
WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?
HE PASSED ON IN '69.
YOU'RE JUST A TAD LATE.
WE WERE HOPING THAT SHERIFF
BRAND COULD TELL US ABOUT
LIONEL CURWIN'S MURDER.
I WAS DEPUTY
WHEN IT HAPPENED.
WE'RE RESEARCHING
A BOOK,
CRIME IN SMALL
TOWN AMERICA.
WHAT YOU
WANNA KNOW?
EVERYTHING.
EVERYTHING.
FIRST OFF, LIONEL CURWIN
WAS A SON OF A BITCH,
IF YOU'LL PARDON
MY FRENCH, MA'AM.
EVERYBODY WAS PRAYING
HE'D GIVE OUT.
BUT NOBODY WAS PRAYING
FOR THE WAY HE FINALLY DID.
[Eli]
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN HE WAS
RIPPED TO PIECES.
PARTS OF HIM WAS EATEN,
WHAT PARTS WAS RECOGNIZABLE.
?
WHAT DID IT TO HIM
A WILD ANIMAL?
AN ANIMAL THAT'LL
TEAR A MAN TO PIECES
AND THEN TRY TO
SET FIRE TO HIS HOUSE?
THEN WHO?
WE DON'T KNOW.
WHOEVER IT WAS
HASN'T DONE IT AGAIN.
IT'S BEEN QUIET AS A GRAVEYARD
AROUND HERE EVER SINCE.
.
[Eli]
WELL..
.
THANKS ANYWAY FOR
YOUR HELP, SHERIFF
YOU BET.
WHERE IS HE? THE MACCLEARY
BOY, WHERE IS HE?
[Phone ringing]
HELLO?
YES, IT IS.
WHAT?
WHEN?
WHO IS IT?
IT'S DR. ODOM.
MICHAEL'S MISSING.
[Car horn blaring]
[Gasping and choking]
[Car honking]
[Groaning]
[Door creaking]
WILL YOU
LET ME SLEEP?
YOU HAVE TO
PROMISE ME FIRST.
WILL YOU
PROMISE ME?
[Eerie moaning]
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN
COME OUT NOW.
[Eerie moaning]
I KNOW
YOU'RE IN HERE.
I KNOW YOU ARE.
[Dog barking]
MISSY, WHERE IS
THAT DELIVERY BOY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE'S ALREADY DELIVERED IT?
I HAVE TURNED THIS
KITCHEN UPSIDE DOWN.
MISSY, THAT BOY AIN'T WORTH
THE POTTAGE YOU PAY HIM.
I'VE TURNED THE KITCHEN
UPSIDE DOWN
AND I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I CAN FIND
HIDE NOR CRUMB
OF HIS ORDER! SHIT.
BYE-BYE.
KOKO!
COME ON IN HERE,
SWEETHEART.
IT IS ABOUT TIME.
WELL, COME ON.
BRING IT ON IN, PLEASE.
DON'T BE DROPPING IT.
YOU BOYS ALWAYS
DROPPING THINGS.
I GUESS YOU PLAY WITH
YOURSELVES TOO MUCH.
MISSY SAID NO MORE
THAN $5 FOR THE MEAT
AND I EXPECT HER
TO STAND BY IT.
SHE SAID $5, AND CARRY
THE 2, THAT'S 12...
ALL THAT'S LEFT
OVER IS FOR YOU.
WHAT KIND OF SLAVE
WAGES IS MISSY PAYING YOU?
YOU'RE THE HUNGRIEST,
DROOLING SOMEBODY
I EVER DID SEE.
SIT DOWN.
THERE'S ENOUGH HERE TO
FEED AN ARMY, ANYHOW.
'COURSE, IF WE COULD
EXTEND IT A LITTLE.
MAYBE IF I CRUSHED UP
SOME SALTINES IN IT.
NO, THAT'S TOO PRETTY
TO DO THAT TO IT. I KNOW.
PUT A LITTLE OF THIS IN IT
AND THAT MAKES IT REAL GOOD.
HOW DO YOU
LIKE YOURS?
I LIKE MINE RARE.
MAKES WAITING EASY.
[Barking]
OH, KOKO.
KOKO!
[Barking]
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU, DARLING?
KOKO!
[Eerie chirping]
WHAT'S THAT?
NO, IT CAN'T BE.
NOT THIS TIME OF YEAR.
YOU HEAR IT?
?
DO YOU HEAR IT
AAGH!
AAGH!
[Sobbing]
AAGH!
[Screaming]
TIPPER, IT'S DINNER.
[Barking and whimpering]
TIPPER!
TIPPER--
TIPPER.
TIPPER, YOU BAD BOY.
OKAY. OKAY.
HE'S SLEEPING
PEACEFULLY NOW.
I THINK IT BEST
WE DON'T DISTURB HIM.
[Doc] HE'LL BE FINE,
MRS. MACCLEARY
DON'T WORRY.
PLATT GIRL FOUND HIM
WANDERING AROUND
OVER AT THEIR PLACE.
JUDGING BY
THE SCRATCHES,
HE MUST HAVE COME
THROUGH THE WOODS.
HE LOOKS SO GOOD.
LORD, AFTER AL
L HE'S BEEN THROUGH,
HE ACTUALLY LOOKS
SO MUCH BETTER.
ANYWAY, THE SCRATCHES
ARE MINOR.
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS NOTHING
WRONG WITH OUR SON.
NOTHING THAT
SOME SIMPLE,
DECENT MEDICAL CARE
COULDN'T CURE.
[Chuckles]
WELL...
YES AND NO.
RIGHT NOW, SLEEP'S
THE BEST MEDICINE.
WELL, WE COULD ALL USE
A LITTLE OF THAT, DOC.
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO HERE.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
[Church bell chiming]
MORNING, DEXTER.
NEWSPAPER ISN'T OPEN YET.
IT'S PAST 10:00.
D
SUCH A THING
HASN'T HAPPENE
SINCE THE NIGHT LIONEL'S
HOUSE WAS TORCHED.
THANK YOU, DEXTER.
[Judge]
EDWIN?
[Flies buzzing]
[Doc] THE TESTS ALL SEEM

WHAT ARE YOU 3
GOING TO DO NOW?

UH, NO,

A BOYFRIEND?
I DON'T.
NO? YOU SHOULD.
[Loon crying]
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?
I JUST,
NEVER HAD NOBODY
TELL ME THAT BEFORE.
[Dog barking]
[Barking]
WHAT'S THAT?
?
DOWN THERE
THAT'S BLACK PINE BOG.
NOBODY EVER
GOES THERE, THOUGH.
NOT EVEN TO
PICK BLACKBERRIES.
IT'S ALL FULL OF BRIARS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO
GO THERE, MICHAEL.
COME ON.
LET'S GO.
[Amanda] LOOK AT THESE BUGS.
AREN'T THEY HORRIBLE?
[Michael]
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
HOW COME YOU DON'T
HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
'CAUSE OF PA,
I GUESS.
HE'S AWFUL STRICT.
[Michael]
HMM.

HORACE PLATT,
LIONEL CURWIN'S COUSIN?
YEAH, HOW'D YOU KNOW?
[Eerie chirping]
MICHAEL?
MICHAEL?
MICHAEL,
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU WANT ME TO
GO GET THE DOCTOR?
NO!
.
IT'S ALL RIGHT
[Shrieking]
YOU SAY THAT'S WHERE
THE DOG WAS DIGGING?
IT WAS JUST DOWN
OVER THERE.
DAMN.
[Sheriff] AS IF I DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH TROUBLE ALREADY.
WHAT YOU
DOING HERE, GIRL?
WE WAS JUST TAKING
US A LITTLE WALK, PA.
I GIVE YOU PERMISSION?
.
LOOK, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO
COME. I TALKED HER INTO IT
GET IN THE TRUCK!
DAMN YOU, BOY.
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY BABY.
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY LITTLE GIRL.
GODDAMN YOU, GIRL!
IS HE ALWAYS
LIKE THAT?
.
THAT WAS CIVIL
A COUPLE OF
YEARS BACK,
CAUGHT HIS WIFE IN BED
WITH ANOTHER MAN.
HE KILLED THEM BOTH.
HE WASN'T PUT AWAY?
HE'S THE JUDGE'S COUSIN.
HE'S GOING
TO HURT HER.
NO, HE ISN'T,
MICHAEL.
HORACE PLATT WILL.
OHH.
YOU'RE TIRED, HON.
YOU'RE STILL NOT WELL.
[Sheriff]
JEFF,
TAKE THE BOY
BACK WITH YOU.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
YOU COULD GO
OUT LIKE THAT.
NOW, I'M PUTTING
YOU TO BED.
AND THIS TIME,
YOU ARE GOING TO STAY PUT.
GO ON.
THAT EXPLAINS MICHAEL'S
OUTBURST THIS MORNING.
WHAT?
AMANDA.
OUR MICHAEL HAS
GOT A CRUSH.
UH.
YOU GO ON BACK. I'M GONNA
STAY HERE FOR A WHILE.
YOU WANT TO GIVE US
A HAND HERE?
OH, SURE.
[Loons crying]
HOLY SHIT.
SHERIFF!
SHERIFF!
LOOK WHAT I FOUND!
[Eli]
GOOD GOD.
DID YOU FIND
THAT HERE?
YES, SIR.
RIGHT IN HERE.
OH, WAIT!
HERE.
HAVE YOU GOT IT?
OH, SHIT.
I'M GONNA GET
SOME MORE MEN.
WE GONNA NEED
A LOT OF HELP.
[Sheriff] IF YOU FIND ANYTHING,
FOLKS, SING OUT.
HELLO, BILL.
DOC, I GOT SOMETHING
DOWN HERE I WANT
TO SHOW YOU.
[Doc]
HOW MANY NOW?
[Sheriff]
36.
DID YOU ID
ANY OF THEM?
NOT YET.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.
COULD BE AN
ABANDONED GRAVEYARD,
AN INDIAN BURIAL GROUND,
CIVIL WAR COMMON GRAVE,
OR SOME MURDERING NUT
SNEAKING IN HERE
AND BURYING HIS BODIES.
[Doc]
MAYBE SO.
TAKE A LOO
K AT THIS ONE.
BUT THIS ONE'S
EMILY OLDENBURGH.
NO, IT CAN'T BE.
I KNOW IT.
WE BURIED HER IN THE
CHURCH GRAVEYARD
WE WERE BOTH THERE,
REMEMBER?
BUT THIS ONE'S
STILL EMILY.
I PUT THIS
STAINLESS STEEL
FEMUR HEAD IN HER
HIP JOINT MYSELF.
SOMETHING ELSE STRANGE.
LOOKS GNAWED ON.
YOU NOTICED, TOO.
I'D HAVE A TALK WITH
DEXTER WARD, IF I WAS YOU.
THERE'S A
PROBLEM, BILL.
[Sheriff]
WHAT'S THAT, DOC?
DEXTER WASN'T UNDERTAKER
WHEN EMILY DIED.
HE WAS HIS ASSISTANT.
WHO WAS?
LIONEL CURWIN.
[Sheriff]
YOU GONNA ASK US IN?
YOU HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON
IN BLACK PINE BOG?
NO, I GOT MY OWN
HANDS FULL HERE,
AS YOU CAN SEE.
YOU OR
LIONEL DO THE WORK
ON EMILY OLDENBURGH?
EMILY OLDENBURGH?
WELL, IT'S BEEN SO LONG
I DON'T REMEMBER.
WHY?
HER SKELETON'S ONE
OF THEM IN THE BOG.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I PREPARED HER HERE
FOR BURIAL MYSELF.
I REMEMBER PLACING
HER IN THE CASKET.
HER HIPS CREAKED.
HUH...
COULD ANYONE HAVE
REMOVED THE BODY
BETWEEN HERE
AND THE CEMETERY?
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.
WHO IS HE?
UH, JUST ANSWER OUR
QUESTIONS, DEXTER.
.
NO, I WON'T.
IT'S INSULTING
I DON'T OWE THIS MAN
ANY EXPLANATIONS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO HE IS.
I'LL TALK TO
YOU LATER, DEXTER.
I LIKE YOUR NEW
PAINT JOB, DEXTER.
WELL?
WELL, WHAT?
WHO'S BURIED IN EMILY
OLDENBURGH'S COFFIN?
NO.
[Train clattering]
HOW ARE YOU, TOM?
WHO ARE YOU?
BEEN A LONG TIME.
IT HAS?
WHO ARE YOU?
OH, YOU'RE THE
MACCLEARY BOY.
.
I'D OFFER YOU A DRINK,
BUT YOUR DADDY MAY GET MAD
YOU DON'T MIND
IF I HAVE ONE.
DON'T YOU
RECOGNIZE ME, TOM?
BILLY? BILLY CONNORS!
LOOK IN MY EYES.
OHH...
NOW, YOU STOP THAT.
HEY, BILLY, BILLY.
BILLY CONNORS.
I REMEMBER BILLY AND ME
LISTENING TO MY DADDY.
WE USED TO PLAY GAMES.
"HEY, BILLY,
"CAN YOU DO
THE MAGIC
"LIKE THE LOCUSTS
AND THE CICADAS?
"CAN YOU GET
THROUGH ANYTHING
"BY BECOMING
SOMETHING ELSE?
"CHANGING,
BEING REBORN?"
YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT?
[Cackling]
I CAME BACK FOR THEM.
ALL OF THEM.
ALL THE CURWINS.
YOU AIN'T BILLY.
[Chuckling]
KEPT MY PEACE
FOR 17 YEARS, JUDGE,
BUT IT'S GETTING TOO HOT.
I WANT MONEY,
A LOT OF IT,
.
AND I WANT OUT
THEY'RE GONNA BE BACK
HERE IN A MINUTE.
I WANT YOU OVER HERE
TOMORROW MORNING
WITH THE MONEY,
JUDGE.
?
I WANT IT HERE
FOR SURE, YOU HEAR
[Door bangs]
[Door creaking]
[Water dripping]
[Glass shattering]
ALL RIGHT, IT'S YOU KIDS
AGAIN NOW, AIN'T IT?
ALL RIGHT, YOU KIDS,
I'M GONNA PUT YOU
IN COUSIN EDWIN'S PLACE.
I'M WARNING YOU.
PEEKABOO,

I'M GONNA GET YOU.
I'M GONNA GET YOU.

[Choking]
[Sheriff] THOSE ARE
NOTHING BUT ROCKS.
[Doc]
DEXTER WARD?
[Sighs]
[Sheriff]
DEXTER WARD.
DEXTER?
WHERE ARE YOU?
[Eli]
OVER HERE.
OH, GOD!
LORD, SAVE US.
HE'S BEEN EMBALMED
ALIVE.
[Eli]
NO.
[Caroline]
MICHAEL'S GONE.
WHAT?
YOU MEAN HE'S
NOT WITH YOU?
NO.
MAYBE HE'S
AT AMANDA'S.
OH, SHIT.
CHRIST, HORACE'LL KILL
HIM. DOC, GO WITH JEFF.
WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT THE HELL
YOU WANT?
IS OUR SON HERE?
JESUS CHRIST! GET THE
HELL OUT OF HERE!
MICHAEL.
MICHAEL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THERE'S A MURDERER
RUNNING LOOSE.
I DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE HER ALONE.
LIAR!
HE SAID HE WAS ONLY
PROTECTING THE GIRL, HORACE.
NOW SETTLE DOWN!
NEXT TIME I'LL KILL YOU,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD, YOU HEAR?
NO! DON'T...
JEFF, GET HIM
OUT OF HERE!
I'M GONNA GET
THAT BASTARD.
!
I'M GONNA KILL YOU
AAGH.
I'M SORRY, BABY.
I'M SORRY.
MICHAEL.
,
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING IN THERE
IN AMANDA'S ROOM?
MICHAEL!
CAROLINE, NOT NOW.
[Eli] COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, BUDDY.
UH-HUH.
WHAT I THOUGHT.
HERE.
THIS IS WHAT
I'VE BEEN FEELING
BENEATH THE SKIN.
?
WHAT IS IT
.
A SUBCUTANEOUS LAYER
JUST BENEATH THE EPIDERMIS
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT BEFORE,
BUT I KNEW
I FELT SOMETHING.
[Caroline]
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
CAN HE TRAVEL?
WELL...
I THINK IT'S TIME WE GOT
HIM BACK TO JACKSON
AND HIS DOCTORS THERE,
DON'T YOU?
.
YEAH, OR MAYBE HOUSTON
OKAY, HOTSHOT,
A BIG SURPRISE.
YOU CAN STOP FAKING IT NOW.
WE ARE GOING HOME.
NO.
LISTEN, THE DOC'S
CHECKED YOU OUT.
YOU CAN'T ARGUE
WITH DOC.
AND YOU CAN WRITE TO AMANDA
WHEN YOU GET HOME.
NOW, COME ON,
LET'S GET GOING.
HOP TO, MY MAN.
YOUR MOM INSISTS.
NO,
I'M NOT GOING.
AND YOU CAN'T
MAKE ME.
WANNA SEE ME TRY?
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
MICHAEL.
DON'T TALK TO YOUR
FATHER LIKE THAT.
.
HE AIN'T MY FATHER
BILLY CONNORS
IS MY DADDY.
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WHY DID YOU
SAY THAT?
I DON'T KNOW, THE WORDS
JUST SLIPPED OUT.
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
PLEASE JUST LEAVE
ME ALONE!
HE'S KNOWN.
BILLY CONNORS.
I AM LOOKING
FOR DEXTER.
I WENT DOWN
TO THE MORTUARY,
IT WAS LOCKED UP.
I WONDER WHERE
HE WOULD BE.
HE'S DEAD, JUDGE.
WHO DID IT?
.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO FIND OUT
TRYING?
EDWIN AND DEXTER
WERE CURWINS.
AND THAT'S WHO HE'S KILLING.
CURWINS.
NOW YOU CALL THE STATE
POLICE IF YOU HAVE TO.
HEY, BILL?
YEAH?
BILL, I...
I KNOW WHO IT WAS.
WAS WHAT?
WHO DONE THE KILLINGS.
IT WAS BILLY.
ONLY IT WASN'T BILLY,
IT WAS THE BOY.
THE MACCLEARY BOY
COME BACK AS BILLY.
UH TOM, UH...
WHY DON'T YOU GET
SOME BREAKFAST?
YOU LOOK LIKE THE HIND
END OF A COON DOG
JUST LEAVING
THE SWAMP.
UGH!
AAGH!
NO, YOU PROMISED!
MICHAEL,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO, UH...
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT BANDAGE?
IT'S NOTHING.
.
NOTHING, YOU DON'T SEE
I TOLD YOU IT'S
JUST A SCRATCH.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
IT MIGHT GET INFECTED.
NOW, JUST RELAX.
AAGH!
MACCLEARY!
[Eli]
YES?
YOU'VE GOT
TO STOP HIM.
STOP WHO?
THE BOY, YOUR BOY.
.
ONLY HE AIN'T YOUR BOY
I MEAN NOT IN HIS HEAD ANYWAYS
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
,
HE'S THE ONE THAT'
S BEEN DOING ALL THE KILLING
.
HE TOLD ME
SO HIMSELF
DON'T YOU SEE?
BILLY HATED THE CURWINS.
BILLY?
BILLY CONNORS?
YOU'RE THE ONE,
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HAS BEEN
TALKING TO MY SON
AND FILLING HIS HEAD
WITH THAT BILLY CONNORS!
YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME
AND YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY SON.
ELI!
I THINK YOU REMEMBER
THIS VOICE.
DOC?
[Clanking]
WHERE WE USED TO COME
WHEN WE WERE KIDS, TOM!
DO YOU THINK I COULD
EVER FORGET THAT?
IT TOOK ME
17 YEARS, TOM.
LIKE THE CICADAS,
BUT I CAME BACK.
TOM!
AAGH!
AAGH!
AAGH!
[Sheriff]
JEFF,
LET'S CHECK THIS OUT.
DOC?
YEAH?
WHAT WAS--UH
BILLY CONNORS LIKE?
BILLY?
STRANGE BOY.
BEAUTIFUL TO
LOOK AT, THOUGH.
TALL, SILENT
WHEN HE MOVED,
HE LOVED
THE WOODS
AND EVERYTHING
IN THEM.
HE TALKED TO THE ANIMALS.
IT WAS SAID
THAT EVEN THE BUGS
WOULD ANSWER HIM.
YOU COULD BE TALKING
ABOUT OUR SON.
YOU BELIEVE IT,
DON'T YOU?
WHAT?
WHAT TOM LAWS
WAS SAYING ABOUT
MICHAEL AND BILLY CONNORS.
I WOULDN'T PUT
MUCH STOCK IN THAT
INDIAN PALAVER,
LOCAL NIOBA NONSENSE.
WELL!
TOM LAWS IS DEAD.
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOUR BOY.
MICHAEL!
MICHAEL! WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?
YOU GOTTA GET OUT.
PA'S GONNA BE
HOME ANY SECOND!
HE SAID HE'D KILL YOU.
HE DO THAT TO YOU?
CAN YOU DRIVE?
KINDA.
OKAY--UM.
I WANT YOU TO
GET IN THE CAR
RIGHT NOW AND LEAVE.
AND YOU KEEP GOING UNTIL
YOU'RE FAR AWAY FROM HERE.
WHY?
WHOEVER KILLED THE OTHERS
IS GONNA COME
FOR YOU, AMANDA.
I KNOW.
BUT WHY? I NEVER DID ANYTHING
TO HURT ANYBODY.
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.
YOU'RE A CURWIN.
NOW, GRAB
SOME THINGS
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
WILL YOU COME
WITH ME?
THEN I WON'T
GO EITHER.
GODDAMN IT!
YOU HAVE TO.
IS IT THAT IMPORTANT

F THIS, SHERIFF.
I HOLD YOU
RESPONSIBLE,
YOU AND THIS WHOLE
DAMN TOWN, TOO.
N
BUT THIS MAN'S
GOT INFORMATIO
AND I'M GOING
TO GET IT
OR HE'S GOING OUT
ON THE STREET.
NO, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING--
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED THAT NIGHT,
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY SON,
AND YOU'RE GONNA
TELL US, BY GOD
OR I'M THROWING YOU
OUT THAT DOOR.
I SWEAR TO GOD, I-I...
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING, JUDGE
YOU BETTER START TALKING.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
DON'T LET HIM...
YOU SON OF A BITCH,
YOU TELL US.
IT WAS BILLY.
BILLY CONNORS!
BILLY CONNORS!
.
IT WAS MY
BROTHER LIONEL
HE'S THE ONE
WHO DID IT.
HE'S THE ONE WHO TURNED HIM
INTO WHATEVER HE IS.
.
NONE OF US KNEW
WHAT TO DO WITH LIONEL
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HEAR SOMETHING?
MY BROTHER LIONEL,
HE WOULDN'T EVEN
TOUCH SARAH,
HIS OWN WIFE.
KNOW WHY?
HE THOUGHT IT WAS SINFUL.
YOU THINK SARAH RAN
OFF WITH BILLY, DON'T YOU?
SHE DIDN'T.
SHE NEVER GOT
THE CHANCE.
WHEN HE CAUGHT BILLY
AND HER TOGETHER,
HE LIKE AS WENT CRAZY.
HE KILLED HER
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
BUT THAT WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM.
OH, NO.
HE HAD TO
TAKE BILLY
AND LOCK HIM UP
IN THAT CELLAR.
AND HE KEPT
HIM THERE
AND HE KEPT
HIM THERE
AND HE KEPT
HIM THERE
UNTIL BILLY COULDN'T
STAND IT ANYMORE,
UNTIL HE WAS STARVING.
AND LIONEL,
HE OPENED UP
THAT CELLAR DOOR
AND HE SAYS:
"BILLY,
"BILLY,
"YOU STILL WANT HER?
"WELL, NOW YOU
CAN HAVE HER."
AND HE THROWS
HER BODY DOWN.
AFTER THAT,
IT WAS EASY.
LIONEL,
THE TOWN UNDERTAKER,
ROBBING HIS OWN COFFIN
S TO FEED BILLY HIS FLESH,
THE HUMAN FLES
H BILLY NEEDED TO LIVE.
HA, IT WAS EASY.
AND YOU ALL
COVERED FOR HIM.
NO,
.
NOT TILL
DEXTER FOUND..
.
FOUND HIS BODY
HE FOUND IT ALL.
JESUS CHRIST, MAN,
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT YOUR WIFE!
BUT HE GOT OUT.
AND HE ATTACKED MY WIFE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU SON OF A--
YOU SON
OF A BITCH!
IT WASN'T
OUR FAULT.
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT!
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
AND YOU LISTEN NOW,
I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU.
IT WASN'T
OUR FAULT.
IT WASN'T
OUR FAULT.
AS SOON AS
WE FOUND OUT,
WE WENT AFTER HIM.
WE DID!
AND YOU LEFT
HIM TO DIE.
AND SOMEHOW HE GOT BACK
TO THAT CELLAR,
THE ONLY PLACE
HE EVER KNEW.
WE JUST FOUND
HIS REMAINS.
MY GOD!
GET DOWN!
OVER THERE!
[Banging]
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
GET BACK BY THE CELLS.
[Gunshots]
GET IT!
ELI,
.
COVER THE BACK
JEFF!
SHERIFF, LOCK ME IN HERE.
IT'S THE ONLY SAFE PLACE.
DOC, SHUT HIM UP!
[Eerie buzzing]
[Banging]
A GUN...
GIVE ME A GUN!
HE'S COMING THROUGH.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, GIVE ME A GUN!
GIVE IT TO HIM.
[Eerie buzzing]
WHAT'S THAT?
THE CICADAS.
THEY'RE COMING
AFTER ME!
THEY'RE COMING
AFTER ME.
YOUR GUTLESS
HIDE IS SAFE.
HE'D HAVE TO
KILL US FIRST.
GOT TO COME THROUGH
THAT DOOR,
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.
[Buzzing stops]
AAGH!
JEFF, LET'S GO.
[Footsteps]
[Heavy breathing]
[Shrieking]
[Screaming]
[Growling]
DOC!
OH, MY GOD!
SHE'S STILL ALIVE. LET'S GET
HER TO THE HOSPITAL.
OH, THERE'S
SO MUCH BLOOD.
[Gurgling, choking sound]
[Gunshots]
