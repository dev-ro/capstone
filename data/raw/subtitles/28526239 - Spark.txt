Aradhana!
Aradhana!
Aradhana!
Aradhana!
What happened, dear?
Come!
Sleep!
Sleep!
What's wrong, dear?
Wake up!
Oldy, didn't I tell you not to
wake me up early in the morning?
You've been dreaming the
same dream for the past 10 years.
Is there any use?
Will he come into reality from the dream
if I don't wake you up?
How dare you not wake up?
I will teach you a lesson.
You won't listen to me, right?
You...
I'm not boasting about her just
because she's my daughter.
I'm telling the truth.
Lekha!
Please note.. she is humble.
She respects elders.
She is organised.
Perfectionist.
Don't ask me anything.
Her father boasts about her.
But this girl threw everything in the
room as if she were a boy.
She would've become a mother
if she had married by now.
Mother!
Hi baby!
She'll be here after getting ready.
My mother.
Lekha's grandmother.
-Greetings!
If I have to say it in one word,
then my daughter is traditional.
She makes us feel proud of her.
They knew.
They are her friends.
Oh! Again?
They are very close to my daughter.
Mother! Is breakfast ready?
dear, Lekha!
Come here.
What is this?
Dress...
What, father?
Actually, Mr. Raju's son...
I didn't like him.
What?
Don't spoil our honour.
Do I have to get married to a person
that you like just because of your honour?
Have you seen his face?
Hey! Enough sitting here, get up.
What?
Lekha!
-Out!
Disgusting!
Sorry!
Is it necessary to spoil my honour
and then reject him?
Not fair.
This is the way your wife raised her.
Why are you blaming me, mother-in-law?
It's all because your son pampers
his daughter so much.
Will you stop with your kitchen politics?
Father, if you behave like this even though
you know everything, then I'll do the same.
It's not like that.
Everyone has a dream boy or girl.
We need to know how he looks and
where he is if you only want to marry...
the person who keeps showing up in your dreams.
For every dream, there's a reason, father.
He's been showing up in my dreams for so long.
I will wait for him to appear.
Please...
Okay.
I'm running late.
I'll take my leave. Bye.
Bye. Bye, grandma.
I'll take my leave.
If you don't get your dream boy in 30 days,
you should agree to marry the person I mentioned.
You have only 30 days.
Okay. Bye.
Don't ask me anything.
Mother!
Close your ears when your daughter talks.
Otherwise, she will cast a spell on you
and make you listen to her words.
She is so smart.
[Chanting]
Will she get married to the person she wants?
If Padmavathi makes a wish,
then Lord Sreenivasa will appear.
Then make a wish.
[Chanting]
If only you would've married the one your father chose,
we shouldn't be here on the road searching for a stranger.
Exactly!
Will you kill me or what?
Why are you looking at me like that?
She's saying the truth.
Your father gave you a time frame of only 30 days.
Will it be enough?
Leka, What happened?
-You left without saying anything
I saw.
What did you see?
-Who did you see?
I saw the person who appeared in my dreams.
Was it really him?
Yes!
I saw him in a black hoodie.
But where did he go?
-Okay, guys.
Did everyone bring Bluetooth?
Yes!
-Okay.
You go that way.
You go this way.
I'll go that way.
Inform me immediately when
you see a guy in a black hoodie.
Okay?
-Done.
Hey! Why did we come to the hospital?
We should go to the bank, right?
We've come to the right place.
But nowadays, where is the money in the bank?
Everything is a digital transaction.
Then where are our people?
Everyone is ready at their places inside.
Sir, today seems like the highest billing day.
Sure.
Not only that, but we couldn't deposit the money
in the bank as today is a holiday for banks.
So all our lockers are filled.
See the amount of money.
Count them as soon as possible
and send them to the bank.
Hey! I found that hoodie person.
I've come to the neura hospital.
Come here all of you.
Yes. He's going to the first floor.
I'm following him.
I'm at the emergency exit.
That black hoodie guy passed by here just now.
I'm close to the lift.
That black hoodie guy is entering the lift now.
What do you want me to do?
Leave me.
Hey!
If you'll be quiet for the next 10 minutes,
then we'll finish our work and go.
If you act smart, then we won't
hesitate to shoot you all.
What's happening?
Hey, move... move...
Let's go.
Sit! Sit down.
Hey! Give me the phone.
Sir! Sir! Sir!
Take the money quickly.
Take it. Take it.
Sir! Sir! Sir!
My child is on his death bed.
Please wait for a few minutes.
Take it from them after I pay them.
I beg of you.
Is it necessary to pay money
for the ones who died?
I got this money by buying the house.
Let me pay them, sir.
Hey! Give it to me.
Sir! Sir, I beg of you.
Lekha, Wait
Lekha!
Lekha!
He is the hoodie guy I mentioned
Really?
Then let's go.
It's a beautiful picture, right?
-Yes.
Hey! Is he your dream boy?
Where did he go?
It's okay.
He came into reality through the dream.
He will come to the wedding altar too.
Okay... Shut up!
Mr. Raju gave me an earful over the phone.
-Fine, Have your coffee.
Mom, Pick out one card among these.
See! Luck is on my side.
Pick out one card among these.
Why one? Give me all the cards.
Very good!
Thank you.
"Make your presence in front of my eyes quickly"
"I can't find you without your efforts"
"Make your presence in front of my eyes quickly"
"I can't find you without your efforts"
"Make your presence in front of my eyes quickly"
Sorry.
"Are you hiding in the valleys?"
"Are you in the forest playing the flute?"
"Are you in a pond, hiding behind
the branches of a tree?"
"Did you forget about the heart that
you stole while stealing other things?"
Hashtag coffee with Karishma.
Phone.
Got him.
I found him, but how do I meet him
within these 6 hours?
"Radesha, make your presence in front of my eyes"
"My eyes are weary, and thoughts of you
keep me from sleeping"
"Radesha, make your presence in front of my eyes"
"Your breath follows me,
whispering that time is slipping away"
"Please come Lord Krishna,
embodiment of adorable and victorious qualities."
"Please come Lord Krishna,
embodiment of adorable and victorious qualities."
"O, the one with big eyes,
what offences have I committed? "
"I cannot bear the onslaught of Cupid,
the god of Love."
"Please come Lord Krishna,
embodiment of adorable and victorious qualities."
Hi guys!
I moved to a new house today.
The bathroom is too small,
but the kitchen is so big.
So starting tomorrow, I'll entertain you by cooking
so many dishes and uploading videos of them.
So keep watching.
Arya! Where were you until now?
Are my boxes here?
Yes. I told them to keep them in your room.
But why did you order so many?
Are you thinking of creating an app
to compete with Amazon?
It's uploaded.
See! I said that I had to go,
but you stopped me.
Now it's midnight already.
There is no cab or auto.
I couldn't get any Rapido bike service either.
I'm walking alone...
Someone is following me.
Who?
I don't know.
-Mamtha, who is he?
Mamtha!
Hello!
What is this? Why are you alone at this hour?
Mamtha!
-Come with us. I'll drop you at your house.
It's okay, sir.
I'll go on my own.
It's okay. Get inside.
Okay, bye.
Bro, one tea.
-Okay.
Don't you have a phone?
Take it.
Hello!
Look over there.
Wait a minute. I'm talking on the phone
Hello!
Yes, I'm coming.
It's raining here.
Wait! I'm telling him. Wait!
"What a beauty! What a beauty!
What's your work on this earth?"
"What's your work on this earth?"
"What a beauty! What a beauty!
What's your work on this earth?"
"What's your work on this earth?"
"Such beauty has never been
witnessed in villages or cities"
"This beauty is like a novel to this earth"
"What a beauty! What a beauty!
What's your work on this earth?"
"What's your work on this earth?"
"Your beauty, akin to a rainbow,
took the form of an arrow in my sight"
"Just like a moon shower,
your smile brought me closer, much like a full moon"
"What a beauty! What a beauty!
What's your work on this earth?"
"What's your work on this earth?"
" Such beauty has never been witnessed
in villages or cities"
I miss her.
What should we do here?
-I don't know.
You said there was no electricity here.
But look over there. There is everything.
How is it possible that there
is electricity in this remote village?
Careful!
-Durgi.
You have to take care of yourself
in these times, right?
She is deaf and can't speak.
But why did you come here?
We're here to arrange a medical camp here.
There are still two women
who are pregnant in our hamlet.
Test them too, and make sure that
they give birth to a healthy child.
We have to arrange a medical camp here urgently.
Principal
-Down! Down!
Lecturers should say sorry.
Principal
-Down! Down!
Principal
-Down! Down!
Lecturers should say sorry.
Principal
-Down! Down!
Hey! Brother Rakesh is here.
Brother Rakesh!
Zindabad! [Long live]
Principal
-Down! Down!
Stop!
The principal...
Mr. Rakesh!
You're a lecturer here.
You should not support the students.
-No, no, no.
I'm not only a faculty member here,
I'm a student too.
I have 8 backlogs.
So I'm a student here.
First, you should know what happen...
I won't.
I don't want to.
This is how I behave.
I'll travel one kilometre at the speed of a rocket
if you give me one cm of leeway.
I'm a devotee of Lord Hanuman.
Just like he doesn't know where his mountain is,
I don't know the capacity of my brain power.
Mental!
What's the issue?
He proposed to a lecturer,
thinking that she was a student.
So what?
What is this, sir?
Why are you requesting him?
Mr. Narayana, his grandpa donated us the
land back then, when there was no college in Vizag.
And there is one and only one condition for that.
Regardless of whether they study or not,
the first child of every generation of this
family should become the faculty of this college.
No matter what choice we have to make,
we must first talk to them before making a choice.
So we must endure what he says or does.
Here, he is not a backlog student,
he is a backlog faculty member.
Then what should we do now?
Principal
-Down! Down!
There is one master who is the right person for him.
He will teach him a lesson.
But they are really closely bonded.
Move!
Principal
-Down! Down!
Hey! Let's go.
Okay.
Guys! Compromise!
Compromise?
Take this garland.
Give it to him, and tell him to give it to him.
Come!
-Okay? Bye!
Mother! Coffee!
I'm coming!
Mother!
Can't you wait until I come?
What's the matter, madam?
Till now, you were looking like a sluggish.
But now you look happy,
as if you've found a treasure. What's the matter?
Why don't you ask about the
condition that you made?
Don't ask me anything.
Ask her, mummy.
Dear, lekha..
What's wrong, oldy?
What about the 30-day condition
that your father made?
Shall I call Mr. Ramaraju's son?
There's no need for that, oldy.
I found the boy that I had seen in my dreams.
Who is he?
Where is he?
I found him.
He came to the opposite house
because I'd been waiting for him.
What do you mean?
But no one lives in that house, right?
No, mother.
Now it is filled with my dream boy.
It's as if Dhoni came in at the last over
and made his team win in cricket.
Can we see that boy?
Do you have a picture of him?
Don't ask me anything.
You go and ask.
You have a lot to find out, right?
So ask him his name, where he is from, his gotra, etc.
Why should I go?
Tell your mother to go.
But you'll ask him better.
Your daughter comes first when
it comes to buttering up people.
Let's go, mother.
-Why are you coming along?
Stay here.
Did my followers learn about
my home so quickly?
I didn't make a home tour either.
What the...?
They're really crazy about me.
What a pleasant surprise!
What's up, oldy?
We're your neighbours.
We live in the opposite house.
Welcome to the community.
So what's your problem?
Do you want dal, salt, curd for curdling,
cumin, red gramme, or black gramme...
Will you just shut up?
Is this house yours?
No!
I came here for robbery,
as there are no people in the house.
There are so many things in the house.
Will you join the 50% partnership?
Poor oldy!
This is my house.
I'm the owner.
Any doubts?
No doubts.
But I can't believe it.
How can you believe it?
You'll believe it only if you come inside.
Come inside by stepping your right leg in first.
Okay.
Nice skin tone, oldy.
If only you would've come before 40 years...
Is this a hotel or a house?
What's your name?
Rambo.
What does it mean?
My name is Rama Brahmam
I hand-picked this name, cut it into slices,
mixed it beautifully, and split it gently.
And I put it as Rambo.
Leave it! What will you do, Bambo?
It's not Bambo, it's Rambo.
Yes! That's the one.
Cooking.
Are you a Cook?
Why do you say that cheaply?
What will be eaten if there is no one to cook?
Do you know one thing?
Do you know how lucky the person
who's going to marry me is?
I'll give her a bed coffee in the
morning at 7 a.m. after she wakes up.
Breakfast at 8 a.m.
Midmorning snack at 11 a.m.
I'll serve lunch at 1 p.m.
I'll give her coffee again at 4 p.m.
Mid-evening snack at 5 p.m.
Midnight biryani, midnight haleem,
followed by Rasgulla at 1 a.m.
She should just be in bed and eat. That's it!
Happy!
That means you'll marry her to
just feed her and make her sleep?
Doesn't she need to do any other work?
Come again!
Why didn't you marry yet?
No, darling.
I didn't have time.
Have you been busy cooking?
Exactly!
You're sharp!
Will you marry my granddaughter?
Is she beautiful?
Yes, she's so fair
She likes you.
It's true.
She likes me?
It won't be possible.
I have to see your granddaughter.
Do you think you'll find a more
beautiful girl than this one?
This girl?
She's been loving you for 10 years in a dream.
There is no filter, either.
What a beauty!
Don't joke with me. Are you sure?
Bambo!
It's not Bambo.
And it's not Rambo either.
I'm your grandson.
Okay, grandson.
Come to our house tomorrow and meet the girl.
I don't understand why she is in love with this Cook.
Hallucination!
Arya! Come here.
Do I need to wear it this way or this way?
Hey! What's with your dressing?
Guess what?
The girl in the opposite house has
been loving me for 10 years.
She wants to marry me.
I'm going to meet her today.
She's been loving you for 10 years?
Yes!
But we shifted yesterday, right?
Our love is telepathic.
Pathetic people like you won't understand.
It's love that happens only to brilliant people like me.
You'll also meet your queen in your dreams if you quit wandering
around and go to bed at the proper hour each night.
Then we four can go on our honeymoon.
I'm almost late for the auspicious time.
Come fast.
How is it possible that my daughter loves him?
I can't understand.
Uncle! Laddu is self-made with pure ghee.
Call me anything but not uncle.
Call me anything?
Okay, Anything!
What's up, Anything?
You just said, Anything.
Sorry, sorry.
Okay, Srikanth.
Srikanth?
That's a self-made laddu made with pure ghee.
Srikanth!
Srikanth!
Does Srikanth have diabetes?
Then...
-Hello, uncle.
Uncle, who is this uncle?
Uncle?
Her dream boy.
Dream boy?
-Since 10 years.
I'll go and meet Lekha.
You're going to meet her anyway, so can you please
ask her what she wants to eat at our destination wedding?
I'll cook.
Leave it here.
Here is my granddaughter.
Grandma, I'm feeling shy.
Get up.
Why did you beat me?
Where is my dream boy?
Where is he?
Are you blind?
Why are you asking, Where is he?
when he is in front of you?
Him?
Hey! It's me, Honey.
Honey is the best.
Who is this joker?
Joker?
Are you out of your mind?
You've been seeing me in your dreams for 10 years.
-Explain Srikanth!
Is he not your dream boy?
If he appears in my dream, then it is not a dream.
It's a nightmare.
Yes!
Nightmare?
What is meant by nightmare?
-Nightmare means peedakala. [In Telugu]
I thought the same when I saw your face.
What the hell is happening here?
Do you think this is a reality show named
We Want Groom?
The whole family is pranking me. I'll...
-Bambo!
It's not Bambo. It's Rambo.
You, tell me.
He is my dream boy.
So good.
Your dream body is my friend, Arya?
Arya!
He really looks like a dream boy.
Everyone is a dreamboy except for me.
Then go to them.
Just shut up!
He came like the Lord Rama
in Seetha's swayamvara.
Why is he the Lord Rama in my swayamvara?
Are you mad?
It's a small mistake, Cook.
Take it lightly.
A small mistake?
I've asked twice,
are you sure because the girl is beautiful?
You said, sure, grandchild. Sure, grandchild.
And now you've brought me here.
Tell her Srikanth!
Don't dare to call me like that.
I'll give you a tight slap with my slipper.
Slipper?
You oldy. It's all because of you.
Arya, dear, come here.
Are you married?
You're repeating it?
Do you have girlfriends?
We both don't have girlfriends.
We are both single and ready to mingle.
I think someone is burning in anger.
Yes, I am. It's become ashes too.
You've been appearing in my
granddaughter's dreams.
She wants to marry you.
Will you marry her?
What? Marriage?
Have you gone mad?
Who are you all?
I don't even know her name.
We'll tell you now.
-This is Lekha.
Hey! What is this?
-What can I tell?
I told you about my beautiful love story, right?
This is the climax's twist.
She is the villain. Oldy.
Sir, just think.
Do girls in this generation tell you that a guy has
been appearing in her dreams and she wants to marry him?
Don't you think it's silly?
I'm sorry.
I don't like this concept.
I don't have an interest in your proposal.
Did you listen to him?
Let it be what has happened.
But I want to say something.
Send every sweet I brought without
leaving even one behind.
Otherwise, I'll file a case at the police station.
We'll do that. Leave!
Bloody Srikanth...
I'll especially file a case against you.
You said sorry, grandchild. Sorry, grandchild.
It's a loss of Rs. 22000 for me.
What is this?
Mother!
Arya!
What did I do to you?
Kattappa(A character in Bahubali movie)
in Bahubali is much better than you.
He stabbed from behind.
But you stabbed directly.
What happened?
-What happened?
You would've told them that Rambo,
who is in front of you,
is much better than me,
who appeared in your dreams.
No! You don't eat,
and you won't let me eat.
Aren't you grateful for anything?
Tell me in one word what did I do to you?
Tell me in one word.
Shall I tell you in one word?
-Tell me in one word.
Pada. [in Telugu]
(Let's go.)
Pada?
Hello everybody.
Dr. Indra, who served our Army as
a consulting neuropsychiatrist for many years...
and later ran hospitals in the private sector,
made great progress and
was the first Nobel Prize nominee from India.
Let's welcome her.
Welcome, madam.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Congratulations!
Very kind of you, sir.
Welcome, madam.
My greetings to everyone.
The human brain is one thing that
is still not completely known in this world.
The progress we are making in technology
is made possible by the brain.
The brain makes it possible for only
humans to talk, feel, and think,
which is not possible for any other living being.
The brain does almost 38,000
trillion operations in just one second.
The Blue Gene supercomputer,
which is the most powerful computer in the world,
also works similarly to that of 0.002% of humans brains.
Each and every sensation
will have a receptor in our brain.
Like receptors for fear, receptors for pleasure...
Ma'am, you've got an urgent call...
I'm thanking the Nobel Foundation...
on behalf of our country for nominating me
for the Nobel Prize for the research I'm doing.
Thank you so much.
The central home minister urgently wants
to meet you regarding Actress Aradhana's case.
A chartered flight is ready for
you at the Begumpet airport.
Come,
Mamatha finish your shopping fast.
Okay, Mum
See there!
-Hey!
Rashmika!
-Ha!
It's nice, right?
It's nice. Buy it.
That one is nice as well.
Mamatha! Look at this one.
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Sneha, where is Mamatha!?
I don't know.
-Where did she go?
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
What happened?
What happened?
Mamatha!
Get up!
Let's go.
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha!
Mamatha, wait.
Mamatha.
Mamatha, wait.
Mamatha!
What happened to her?
Swapna died over there.
Come!
Mamatha, wait.
Wait, Mamatha.
Mamatha!
Wait, Mamatha!
Mamatha!
-Mamatha!
Mamatha!
-Mamatha!
Mamatha...Mamatha...
Mamatha...Mamatha...
Where is the Local SI, Anand?
Over there.
Anand!
Come here.
Anand!
Don't call me Anand.
Call me Anandi.
Whether you're Anand or Anandi, I don't care.
And I also don't have any problems
with your sexual orientation.
It's better if you could wear less makeup during duty.
Did you investigate?
You're fresh, right?
That's why I didn't start to see your performance.
Girl, come here.
No, no, no.
You stay there.
Boy, come here.
Ask him.
You've seen everything, right?
What happened?
When I was entering the mall,
that girl jumped and died.
That's the only thing that I saw.
Okay. You go.
-Go.
She is Mamatha's mother.
They're Mamatha's friends.
If we ask them about her...
Madam, does your daughter have
any personal problems or health issues?
No sir.
There's nothing like that.
She is a very happy person.
She talks with everyone.
Sir.. Sir.. Are there any suspicious person
behind these deaths?
Does she have any health issues?
Sir, what is the reason behind these two deaths?
We don't know anything,
whether it is because of a health issue,
a depression issue,
motivation, or any other activity.
We don't know anything...
We'll let you know the complete
details once we get the postmortem report.
Okay?
Okay. Leave!
That's it. You can leave!
Anand, send bodies to postmortem.
-Okay, sir.
Careful!
Without waiting for joining instructions,
you began your duty.
That's why I recommended you for this mission.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
Did you find anything interesting there?
Not yet, ma'am.
Actually, I studied a little bit of the actress
Aradhana's case that you mailed me.
And at the same time, I investigated Mamatha's case
that happened in the shopping mall.
Patterns are the same, but motives are different.
I can't believe that it's a suicide.
But there is no proof that it's a murder.
So how do you want us to treat these cases?
I need some time, ma'am.
I'll think from a mental health point of view.
You think from a crime point of view.
Sure, ma'am.
-Is that okay?
Yeah.
-Okay, done.
Thank you.
He's playing so well, isn't he?
Yes. He is.
-Hey, he is coming...
Ignore him.
-Okay.
Hey! Why are you here?
Hey! Good shot!
Yes. He played well.
Why are you quiet?
Yesterday, when Rakesh was supporting us,
you said, Let's compromise, and took us.
We didn't like it.
-We didn't like it.
Student life is very small.
You have to use it properly.
Why involve yourself in protests?
Where is Rakesh?
I think he's eating in the canteen.
Go and bring him.
Let's go.
Jay, what's wrong?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is the girl studying at our college?
Yes. Her name is Ananya.
She is a new medical student.
Why? Do you like her?
I saw her at the bus stand two days ago.
I fell for her the moment I saw her.
Our eyes love many people,
but our hearts love only a few people.
Really?
Then why are you delaying it?
Go and propose to her.
That girl should first know my name.
She should know about me.
Then I'll propose to her.
You've got a lot of work to do.
Go ahead!
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon.
-You can leave.
Ma'am, I'm Ananya.
I've been in touch with you through email.
Ananya.
-Yes, ma'am.
When did you come?
It's been two days since I came here.
Good!
I saw your email, and I really liked your ideology.
Setting up medical camps in tribal areas.
It's nice.
Thank you Ma'am.
Dude, I'm hungry.
Give me your phone. I'll order something.
It's here?
Why are Ananya's pictures on his phone?
Is he in love with her?
Two, Three.
He is in love with her.
You've seen the Tholi Prema
movie 100 times, right?
Even though generation changes,
it drives youth crazy.
However, one-sided love is the purest form of love.
Oh!
No matter how many times I watch it,
it's the best movie.
That means one-sided love.
I'll be back in a minute.
Tholi Prema, Ananya, one-sided love.
My Jay is in love.
I won't stress to him that he will propose to her,
instead, I'll try to make them get closer.
A film by Rakesh.
Bro! Your both are perfectly
made for each other.
Amazing, bro!
That's it!
Super?
Your pair is lovely.
Pair?
Rakesh!
Hey, Rakesh!
Hey! Everyone is saying pair.
Who are they?
Your name is Jay.
It's nice, right?
I'll....
I'm not talking about peru (Name),
I'm talking about pair.
I'll tell you. Calm down.
Ananya.
Boys! Turn backwards.
You look forward.
Did you see her?
Is she going in slow motion by looking at you?
Hey! What did you plan?
-Plan B.
What do you mean by Plan B?
-Even I don't know about it.
If you do something crazy in the name of Plan B,
I'll put a cracker under you.
Still, there is more time left for Diwali.
You can go.
You're impossible.
-Let's begin the game.
Bro, bro, bro.
Give it to me quickly.
The principal will get angry if he sees this.
Who is he? I'm with you, right?
-Give it to me.
Go! Go! Leave!
Leave!
Leave!
Don't you have any shame at all for selling
drugs to the students in the college?
Who are you to question me?
Idiot!
Brother!
Leave me.
We will sell.
Do whatever you want. Go!
Be careful.
Come!
Ananya, are you okay?
Calm down.
Ananya!
Ananya!
Ananya!
Don't cry, Ananya.
Ananya!
Don't cry.
-Ananya!
Calm down.
Please!
I won't spare him.
Jay.
How many times do I have to
tell you not to sell drugs in college?
He is asking something.
Have you all heard it?
Forgive me, sister.
We won't sell drugs in college starting now.
He might kill me.
Tell him to let go of me.
He is Jay.
Jay, you said she had to know about you, right?
Now she knows about you.
Go and propose to her.
Lekha!
Lekha!
Lekha!
Why are you laughing when
you should be sobbing over his rejection?
When did he reject me?
He refused me.
That's it!
 What's the difference between them?
Arya is already known to me,
as he's been appearing in my dreams.
But in reality we just met.
But he didn't get to know me, right?
That's why he said no.
Then what's your next step?
I'm gonna make him fall in love with me.
Hi!
-Hi!
Hi!
-Hi!
Bye...
-Hey..
It was a small misunderstanding.
We are very sorry to have hurt
such a good person like you.
That's why we brought a hot pizza for you.
Forgive us, Mr. Rambo.
Friends?
Pizza...
Thank you.
Bye!
What is this, Mr. Rambo?
Won't you ask your friends to come in,
as they're already at the entrance of the house?
Now we're friends, right?
So dumb of me.
Come inside. We'll party.
Arya! Do you want to eat pizza?
Our neighbours brought it for us.
They're so kind.
It's a small misunderstanding. That's it.
Sit! Sit! Sit!
They came here for the first time,
so I'll prepare a tasty welcome drink.
It's my special.
Rambo's mogambo.
I'll be back.
Okay.
Okay.
I know why you're here.
Let's drink this first,
and then let's plan how to impress him.
Okay?
Basically, he's shy.
He's an introvert, too.
Don't get tense. Text him and tell him to come.
Really?
Yes. Tell him.
Done.
Let's see.
Arya!
Listen to me.
I know that even you like that girl.
You should be lucky enough
to have someone who loves you.
I know how it feels.
Listen to me.
Stop doing all this and move on.
He said yes.
"I don't know why I met you,
but now I know why"
"Little by little, I'm getting closer to you"
"I'm alone, and I heard you calling me"
"I'm together with you and saying it"
"Slowly and slowly, I'm becoming yours"
"Lekha! Lekha! I'll be with you till the end"
"Lekha! Lekha! who else if not you?"
"Even your shadow is not present in my past"
"But my future is not complete without you"
"You're like a way to shore"
"Lekha! Lekha! I'll be with you till the end"
"Lekha! Lekha! who else if not you?"
Brother! There should be jars and test tubes
with bubbles and smoke coming out of them.
Where are they?
That is the lab.
Where should I find the 07 rack?
How can we find 07 among all these racks?
See here.
Here you go!
Who puts 7 after 8?
Right?
-Search for it.
I found it.
Let's go.
Ananya?
Hello, Jay.
-Tell me.
The book you've mentioned is not in the library.
Come to the library.
-It's in your hand, right?
Shh!
Look there.
Today I must...
Let's make them closer.
-But how?
Plan Racks.
Shobhan...
What?
Are you okay?
I knew when I saw him that
something wrong would happen.
The inspection is tomorrow.
What's up with all these issues I'm having today?
Madam! Madam! It's already so late.
Please take your leave.
We will both organise these books.
You don't need to stay.
We'll handle it, ma'am.
You can go. Go!
You also come along.
Hey!
Let's go.
What?
Let's leave them here and go.
Let's go.
Faculty!
-Sister-in-law!
My head is aching really bad.
Send someone to get me a coffee
from the canteen.
Go!
Sure, Sister-in-law.
Hey! Go and get some coffee for sister-in-law.
Okay.
And get some Little hearts biscuits too.
Why?
My grandfather said..
-Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Ananya.
My heart felt it already.
And now my lips also wanted to say.
What?
I love you.
Thank you.
You said thank you instead of sorry,
I'm not interested. Right?
See! It's nothing like that.
If I have to talk to you in the way that you do,
then I should have feelings
for you just like you have for me.
Otherwise, I should have any
special feelings for you.
So thank you is the most special
thing I can say at this moment.
So thank you, Jay.
Got it. Got it.
I've been wanting to ask you this for a long time.
This place does not look like a tribal village.
You all are much more advanced than us.
Yes, ma'am.
Jay is the reason for such advanced life
He comes to our village every week.
Too wet to go out...
He is educating us and our children.
Mr. Jay.
She is asking about Mr. Jay.
All the reports are normal.
I'll give some vitamin tablets.
It will be enough if you use them.
Good job, Kavitha.
Get these tablets.
-Okay, madam.
Brother...
I'm going to attend Puja.
Will you come along?
You go! I'll come.
Mother! I'm going to attend Puja.
Take care of Durgi.
You can go. I'll take care of her.
Why're you taking a sickle?
Durgi!
Durgi!
Where are you?
Durgi!
What happened?
Durgi!
Durgi!
Where did you go?
Durgi!
Durgi!
Durgi!
Durgi!
Durgi!
Durgi, what happened?
What happened to you?
Listen to me carefully.
I checked Mamatha's postmortem report just now.
No clue.
So I need GHMC CCTV coverage.
Okay, sir.
In the meantime, I'll inquire about
Aradhana's case once again.
Come...
Sir!
You.. buffalo
Why are you here?
He wanted to say something important to you.
What do you want to say? Tell me.
Sir, your younger daughter's friend
is not as good as you think.
He killed his own girl friend in Vizag.
I escaped from there because I'm scared of what
he will do to me now that I know about it.
Arya?
-Yes, sir.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Hey!
Lekha!
Sir!
Harshita's mom?
Hello.
Hello, aunty.
Lekha...
Harshita hasn't been home since the evening.
Is she with you?
No, aunty.
She left the cafe, saying that she had some work.
Didn't she come yet?
What happened?
Madam!
The car is broken down.
Your house is not far from here, right?
Can you go?
Okay.
Hey! Who are you?
Why are you following her?
Are you trying to kidnap her?
Harshita!
Harshita!
Harshita!
-Harshita!
Harshita!
What happened?
Tell us.
What's wrong with you?
We are all worried about you.
The phone is turned off.
This is Sai sir..
Harshita safely reached home.
Uncle, take Harshita home.
We'll discuss it in the house.
Yes, uncle... take her
Come, dear.
Speak up!
What happened?
Mother!
Did Harshita come?
Harshita came just now, father.
Wh... What is her state of mind?
What is her state of mind?
Why did you stop there? Come in.
Did that girl speak up?
No, sir.
Don't leave her alone with her parents.
Got my point?
Yes, sir.
Okay, sir.
-Oh my God!
Harshita!
Harshita!
-Harshita!
Don't...
Harshi...
Please don't kill.
Harshita!
Uncle!
Harshita!
Arya!
Harshita!
Harshita!
She is dead.
Leave her.
Why did you come here?
Do you want to kill my daughter, Lekha, too?
How many people will you kill?
Leave him.
What are you doing, father?
You don't know, dear.
This evildoer will kill you too.
Just like Harshita died, you will die too.
Let's go to the police station.
What are you talking about, father?
Harshita died...
Poor girl! You don't know anything.
It happened according to his plan.
Harshita!
Do you know how many people died because of him?
Here! Here! Here!
Here! See!
All these... All these...
Where do you think I got all these things from?
From his room.
Forget it!
Mamatha in the shopping mall the other day...
Today, Harshita...
And it will be you next.
Forget it!
His name is not Arya.
He is Jay.
Tell her.
Where are you looking?
Tell her.
Tell her.
Tell her.
Wait a minute, father.
Arya, what's happening?
Look into my eyes and tell me that this is not true.
Tell me that your name is not Jay, but Arya.
Tell me. Please, Arya.
Tell me that you didn't have any girlfriends in the past.
Swear on me and say.
I'll believe in you.
Please, Arya.
My name is Arya Jay Dev.
That's it.
Yes, My Ananya died.
Does that mean what all father said is true?
Lekha!
Lekha!
- Wait.
Lekha!
I need to talk to you.
You don't need to talk to her.
You dare to come there.
Go back now.
Please...
-Daddy
Lekha, give me a minute.
-Wait, dear.
Stop it.
- Uncle.
I can understand your anger.
But I need to answer some of Lekha's questions.
Lekha, I need one hour of your time.
You are the one and only person
I care about in my life.
You won't be seeing me after this.
No, don't, dear.
Don't, dear. Don't go.
Please. I'll take him to the police station now.
How dare you?
-Lekha, please.
How dare you?
-Lekha. Trust me.
Dad, stop.
This is the last time.
Trust me.
Thank you
Let's go.
If you have to know what actually happened,
you should know about Ananya.
What? Looks like you are in a good mood.
Did I disturb you?
No.
Fine, tell me why did you call me?
Should I tell you?
I'll be happy if you are able to tell me.
I want to give you the chance to
understand me for my whole life.
I'll be more happy if you tell me
in a way I can understand.
Sometimes the understanding part is called life.
And the moments we create
together become memories.
Let's make memories together.
Oh no. I can no way find Oxford's
dictionary in this jungle.
Tell me in a way I can understand.
Like how you are sharing your love to everybody,
you should give that love wholly to me for a while.
I understand now.
I'm telling you now.
From now my love is all yours.
Every second and for my whole life.
Every second we spend together
should become a memory to me.
That should be with me for life long.
Yes.
Let's make some memories together.
"A few memories are all we need,"
"much like flowers throughout our life span"
"Memories are akin to autographs,"
"they are the lamps that illuminate our joy"
"Each memory, in its own unique way,
brought me closer to you"
"A spell was cast, making sure
I'd never forget you"
"Bad times are like blank paper"
"Each memory transforms
into a variety of colours"
"A few memories are all we need,"
"much like flowers throughout our life span"
"Memories are akin to autographs,"
"they are the lamps that illuminate our joy"
"Each word I share with you turns
into a cherished memory"
"Silence is also a memory"
"A sweet memory
...Every fight"
"A precious memory
...Every smile"
"A hug, at this point in life,
is a memory filled with warmth"
"As you become a cloud, each memory
condenses into a raindrop upon contact"
"A few memories are all we need,"
"much like flowers throughout our life span"
"Memories are akin to autographs,"
"they are the lamps that illuminate our joy"
"A journey that's leading me
to like you more is a memory"
"A sojourn is a memory as well"
"Hope is a memory
...Every touch"
"A desire is a memory
- Every step"
"The delightful connection
between our lips is a memory"
"The thought of us together transformed
all my memories into a novel"
"Each memory, in its own unique way,
brought me closer to you"
"A spell was cast, making sure
I'd never forget you"
"Bad times are like blank paper"
"Each memory transforms
into a variety of colours"
"A few memories are all we need,"
"much like flowers throughout our life span"
"Memories are akin to autographs,"
"they are the lamps that illuminate our joy"
Why are you looking like that?
It's nothing.
Tell me, it's okay.
I'm scared.
Why?
I don't know.
I want both of us to be like this forever.
Would we be?
For sure.
Don't worry.
We ate nothing when we started.
I'll get you something to eat.
Bro, give me two dosas.
Jay.
Brother, give me 2 coconuts.
Kavitha..
Jay!
Jay!
Kavitha..
Ananya.
Ananya..
She is all right.
Hey, Rakesh.
How is Ananya?
They said they'll discharge after they
keep her under observation for two days.
Is the discharge summary of patient 301 ready?
Get it ready.
I'll come and see it.
Okay, ma'am.
-Okay?
Doctor. what about the accident patient?
She's recovering well.
There's no problem. She's fine.
Did they say there's any problem?
-Nothing will happen.
I'm coming there now.
You don't have to come.
How could I leave you both alone?
I'm here.
I'll bring her after she's discharged.
No matter what you say,
I'm so tense. I'm coming now.
I'll take care of it.
Ananya!
Ananya!
Ananya! What are you doing, Ananya?
Ananya!
Ananya!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Ananya!
Don't, Ananya!
Listen to me, Ananya!
Listen to me, Ananya!
Ananya! Don't.
Please. What are you doing, Ananya?
Wait, Ananya!
Ananya!
I couldn't bear Ananya dying in front of me like that.
A bigger shock to me is that the police arrested me
thinking that I did something to Ananya.
Mister, why don't you tell the truth?
He'll beat you to death.
Get up.
Sir, hello.
Here are Jay's bail papers.
Wow. She has a striking figure, dude.
You killed this girl?
If you told us before, we would have shared her.
Ouch!
Hey, no matter how much I beat you, won't you feel ashamed?
- Jay. Stop it.
Did you see?
Jay.
He has no self-control.
Would anybody believe it
if that person didn't commit a crime?
What's this, Mr.Rakesh?
- Hello?
Tell him to be a little careful.
-Hey, come on.
Okay, sir.
-Go now.
I couldn't even see Ananya for the last time.
Everything is over. Look there.
Ananya!
What actually happened?
What happened to Ananya?
Why did she do that?
There are many questions.
There's no answer to any question.
At the same time, I recalled another
incident which happened to me.
Jay!
I came to know that Kavitha also
committed suicide last week
mysteriously through a newspaper
article that Ananya tried to show me.
I went to the tribal area which has the medical camp
where both of them worked together for the
last time to see if I'll know the reason for these deaths.
Sir.
Last time a girl came along with you,
where is she now?
She passed away.
She passed away the very next day
she left this tribal area.
Is she passed away?
Yes, she died.
That means, the ghost who killed our Durgi
must've killed the girl you loved, sir.
Durgi passed away?
Yes, sir.
Some evil power has taken their lives.
It is all your perception
But, if I see it with my own eyes,
then I will believe it.
You are saying that it is evil power.
But I'm saying that there is someone behind all this.
I will show the world who is behind all this.
Sit.
Tell me.
Sir.
I got to know this when I went out on bail.
This girl is Kavitha. She worked along with
Ananya as a volunteer in the medical camp.
She's a medico.
Last week, she also committed suicide mysteriously.
Sir, look at this.
Her name is Durgi.
She's a patient in the same
medical camp in the tribal area.
She also committed suicide.
In Vizag 16 such suicides have taken
place in the last 6 months, sir.
A perfectly fine will suddenly change.
She'll kill her friends, relatives, parents,
boyfriend or somebody else, sir.
After that she'll commit suicide, sir.
This doesn't only happen in Vizag.
Look at all these, sir.
These cases have already happened in different cities.
New Delhi.
Mumbai.
Kolkata.
Bangalore.
And now they are happening in Vizag, sir.
Look at this map once, sir.
I marked all the suicides happened in Vizag.
Sir, if people like you help,
we can stop all these suicide killings, sir.
Suicide killings you said, right?
-Yes, sir.
You have a good writer in you.
You created a story that only one guy did all that
Sir.
and you want to escape by making me trust that.
If I leave you outside like this,
you'll make the court believe it.
Sir.
What?
The SP is on the line, sir.
Put on handcuffs for him and
make him sit outside.
Hey, get up. Move. Move.
- Please listen to me, sir.
Try to think about it seriously, sir.
- Quiet. Move.
Good morning, sir.
Sir, at least you try to understand me.
Hey, stop talking and sit there.
Sir, please.
-Come on, sit.
Sir, what's this?
Please, sir.
Sure, sir.
All the guns are entered, right?
-I did it, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
I'll take care of it.
Mister, go and get Jay.
Sir. Jay escaped, sir.
He escaped?
I kept the two guns which
we took for the raiding on the table.
I also can't find them, sir.
Hey, I'll lose my job.
Go and search for them.
I understood then that no one would believe me.
I'm on my own here.
Until I kill the people
who are behind Ananya's death,
I will not rest.
Unexpectedly I got a call from Dr.Bhavani
who worked with Ananya in the tribal area.
Actually, I came from America yesterday.
I was shocked after knowing that Ananya,
Kavitha and Durgi had passed away.
I think I am in danger, too.
I should tell you the thing which happened that day, Jay.
Ma'am.
These are antipsychotic drugs, doctor.
What?
Why are you giving them to her?
I didn't. It's ma'am who prescribed her.
Why are you prescribing antipsychotic
drugs to a pregnant lady?
This is not my prescription.
Just check it.
This is not my prescription.
-Hey, wait. Wait.
You check it.
This is mine.
There's something wrong.
We need to find it out.
When I threatened the compounder
who escaped, he told me.
Wait!
Tell me.
What happened?
I know nothing, sir. Sir.
-Tell me.
Tell me what had happened?
I really know nothing.
They paid me to do this.
I know nothing more than that, sir.
-Who? Who made you do that?
Who told you to do this?
Sir, he's tall with a beard and a shaved head, sir.
I understood then that,
there's a person behind all these suicides and
that there's a common connection between all these.
At the same time, I read the news of actress
Aaradana's suicide in Hyderabad.
I came to Hyderabad and met the producer
who made the most movies with her.
What's your opinion on Actress Aaradhana's suicide?
I have known Aradhana since her childhood.
There are no such issues that lead to her suicide.
Are there any medical issues?
She has Type 1 diabetes.
She used to frequent the neura hospital to get it treated.
I came to neura hospital with the hunch
that Aradhana's suicide is linked to the neura hospital.
You saw me there accidentally.
I have collected the data of every girl between
18-25 years who visits that neura hospital frequently.
I tracked each and every one of their movements.
This is what has happened.
I came here to solve this case.
Not to get stuck in this mess.
I felt that you, Harshita and many more girls
are in danger. So I tracked all your movements.
I know that those suicides would come to you.
I wanted to find the answers through you.
But I couldn't save Harshitha after knowing everything.
Lekha, give me a minute.
I didn't come to you as a person
who comes in your dreams.
I came here searching for answers for a few questions.
I thought I was not ready when
you tried to approach me initially.
But I don't know when and why it happened.
You are so close to my heart now.
I'm telling you now.
You are my future.
But if I have to come to this future,
I should get answers to the questions of my past.
After I find out my answers to those questions,
I'll come to you as your dream person.
Till then, I need some time.
Dear.
Dad..
-Dear...
Grandma, I think I'll need some time.
He's tall with a beard and a shaved head, sir.
Take them.
Harshita.
What do you want, sir?
I'm searching for an ambulance
driver working in your hospital.
He's tall, bald and has a beard
and a tattoo on his neck.
Have you ever seen him?
Him? It's David.
His name is David?
Did he come today?
I'll see him once in a while, sir.
Where does he stay?
I don't know for sure.
I saw him once when I went
to the old city to buy ganja.
Please be careful.
Let's have some fun.
He came...
He came to my house.
Finish him.
Come on, move.
Then I understood that
this is much bigger than I thought.
But, I'll not stop until I get the answers I want.
I'll fight back.
Take it.
James.
Impossible.
My compass.
Sir, where does that bald guy live?
There.
Thank you.
Major General Bharadwaj.
Retired.
New Delhi.
Hey, Arya.
Here...
Jay!
-Why are you here?
CI Ashok Reddy arrested our guys
and is beating them to extract info about you.
Hey, tell me where Jay is. Tell me. Come on.
-Sir, we really don't know. Ouch.
I escaped from them.
You should come once.
Who's this guy with those cards around his neck?
Is he epileptic?
Who the hell is this guy babbling nonsense?
Arya. Why does he call you Jay?
Does he have forgetfulness?
Ask Liberty college, it will tell you about our bonding.
Tell him, Jay.
Hell with that bonding.
I'm his childhood sweetheart.
-A criminal gang?
Why do I care about your family?
Hey, you are going overboard.
-Stop it.
My name is Arya Jayadev.
Don't you know that?
I know.
I found a link and I'm going to Delhi.
I'll find an answer.
They attacked us with huge guns
when we went to the old city.
Is it necessary to go to Delhi?
It might be a risk. Please don't.
What are you saying?
Hey! Please don't go.
Hey, blackie. Give me the way.
Blackie?
It's not me. I'm a joker.
You are the blackie.
- She called me that.
Who is she?
She's his present lover.
Tell me, Sister-in-law.
Don't stop him.
-Why?
He should go.
He should find the answers to his questions.
Until he comes, I'll be waiting like this.
Tell him that.
He's here, why don't you tell him yourself?
Hey, did you hear that?
Go now.
Go in slow motion watching her.
Let's not disturb both of them.
Let's go into the room and stay the
whole nightâ€¦ Let's drink and watch a duet.
Let's go.
"By bending milky way..."
"By splitting the blue sky from top to bottom"
"By collecting the stars amidst the string of clouds"
"By bringing an end to the hasty air movement"
"I've appeared in front of you"
"Extend your hand to me.
Why are you hiding?"
"Is this magic?
Or is this real?"
"Is the dream's power
what makes it feel real?"
"What did you bring from the galaxy?"
"I plucked and brought two comets"
"I placed them in your ears as earrings"
"What have you brought from the morning sky?"
"I've brought moon light"
"However, I let it go, as it doesn't
do justice to your cheek's shade"
"Why did you bring the black hole?"
"To put a Kaala Teeka (a black mark
to ward off evil eyes) on your cheek"
"The joy in my imagination stands before me
How can I trust this?"
"Your love can become the
ruler of the universe if you believe"
"Is this magic?
Or is this real?"
"Is the dream's power
what makes it feel real?"
My name is Arya and
I come from Hyderabad.
I want to meet Mr Major Bharadwaj.
I'm sorry. It's been a month since
my grandfather passed away.
See this.
To find answers for a few questions,
I came for him with a lot of hope.
Would you be able to help me?
I don't know much about my grandfather.
I was born and brought up in Canada.
Grandfather wanted to donate
this house to an orphanage.
I've just come here to fulfil his last wish.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Oh! All my hopes were dashed.
Excuse me.
I feel like you've come here to talk
about an important matter with grandfather.
This may be useful for you.
This box belongs to my grandfather.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
The new year has started.
I was deployed to the LOC.
Soldiers! Call the ambulance.
Shut up!
Diya, my formula.
Sir!
Relax his hand.
Relax. Relax.
Relax.
Monitor him.
How many months will it take to heal, doctor?
Months?
-Do you mean years?
Wait and see.
Do it once again. Okay.
-Excuse me, sir.
Mr.Rudra.
-Sir.
I've recovered fully because of your treatment.
Thank you so much.
That's good.
Tell...
Speak out!
Speak out!
Speak out!
Speak out!
Tell me where you are going to do the attack.
-I won't tell you.
David.
Truth serum.
Sir, how long should we do these truth serum tests?
It's very old.
We need in time.
Shall I try something new, sir?
Sir!
Matchbox.
Yes!
I'll tell you. Don't kill me.
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.
Don't kill me.
I found the way Rudra extracted the truth
from a captured terrorist very interesting.
Dr.Rudra.
-I know, sir.
Hi.
-Hello.
It's Dr.Rudra who proposed the
mental breakdown method.
How much do you trust this mind
control method, doctor?
Yes, there are separate receptors
in our brain to receive each emotion.
If we eat sugar, a receptor called
Dopamine will be secreted.
It's just like that.
If we activate the fear or
fright receptors in the brain,
they will undergo an hallucination that they are in danger.
Then they start attacking others.
For that we need an actively
functioning healthy brain.
Only then can we study.
I guess we need to start stealing the brains.
Why to steal?
We have terrorists to experiment with..
Oh. We should counter them with
unique ideas like the MK Ultra program.
You should take an initiative
on this and tell the Indian army.
Please.
Do you think it's possible?
Terrorists are up to date with
the advanced technology day by day.
Our counter strike...
It should be beyond technology, sir.
We propose SPARK sir.
SPARK?
Sense Perception Altering and
Reactive Control Program.
SPARK.
What's your opinion, Ms. Indra?
Let's decide after we see the
results of the SPARK Program.
Then, let's approve SPARK.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
After the SPARK Program was approved,
Rudra's behaviour changed.
He used to stay in the lab round the clock.
But he never let anybody know about which
experiment he is doing, on whom and all.
Slowly people started complaining about Rudra.
Sir, I should tell you about something very important.
Mr.Rudra is not saying anything to us now, sir.
I suspect something, sir.
I'll look into it.
-Yes, sir.
There are no subjects, sir.
They are over.
What shall we do?
There's a tribal village nearby.
Yes, sir.
Arrange a medical camp.
David.
- Sir!
Send all these reports to Diya immediately.
Okay, sir.
Thank you, thank you.
Hi, Ratan.
Soldiers treated by Rudra are
dying one after the other by vomiting blood, sir.
Colonel.
We've searched the whole area.
We see no one.
What could have happened?
-We don't know.
Sir!
What happened?
Rudra.
Sir!
-Yes.
The whole tribal area turned into a graveyard.
Rudra killed everyone brutally.
Where is he?
Due to the fear receptors on the stimulus,
the brain is prone to extreme fear
I was shocked after reading the American
CIA MK Ultra program document
They are committing suicide to
get out of that hellish situation.
Rudra!
Stop it!
This is too cruel.
Why pity terrorists?
They are just lab rats.
That's all!
You called our soldiers lab rats?
guinea pigs
Eight of the soldiers you treated died.
10 members are in danger.
The tribal area has become a burial ground.
Yes.
What is this?
What kind of treatment is this?
Every experiment will have a side effect, sir.
How will I become responsible for that?
Are you trying to rationalise yourself?
I'm just stating the facts. That's all.
Do the same thing in front of the
disciplinary committee tomorrow.
What is this, Rudra?
I'm worried after seeing these reports.
It would be a big mess if these got leaked to the media.
And there are central elections within a few days.
Actually, what do you want to say?
Mind control programme.
Controlling our brain.
That's it, right?
No, sir.
It's not controlling our own minds.
It's about controlling others minds and their actions.
But what's the benefit for us?
If we control our minds,
then our future will be in our hands.
But if we control others minds too,
then their future will also come into our hands.
gives most of its budget to defence.
If we are able to control others minds and actions,
then we can kill anyone from where we are,
no matter where they are.
So there will be no war.
Half of the budget will be reduced.
Is this why I approved it?
Park program.
-No, sir.
Spark program.
Whatever!
This is...
If you want to achieve something here...
You're simply blabbering.
You can remove him from this programme,
and you can do it, Bharadwaj.
If they could do this without me,
then we wouldn't be here for the meeting.
Oh!
Okay.
Does that mean you know better than them?
Then I can prove it, sir.
Check my documents once.
Riya...
Okay, sir.
Are these your documents?
Is there no proof in the lab to show?
So you spent crores for this?
But if you could've saved that money
and renovated temples with that money,
then people in our country would've lived happily.
Right, Am I, Indra?
Come! Come!
Sir! Sorry, sir.
Riya!
Riya!
What happened?
Diya!
Don't worry.
She is unconscious.
Take her to centre.
Yes, sir.
Soldiers!
This is what Spark is.
But its reaction is different for males and females.
I realised it recently.
I know that you are a minister.
You're just a person who is harming that person
who got injected with this chemical. That's it!
A sense of fighting for survival will act right away.
Now, what you saw was fear of a fight response.
That means the person into
whom I injected this Spark
will have a hallucination that someone is attacking them.
Every action will have a reaction, right?
That's why she attacked you.
When did you give her an injection?
I've put a chemical on her inhaler.
She inhaled it just before she came to you.
So this drug will enter the mind through the air?
Yes!
Air and water.
Rudra, why didn't you update us
on the progress until now?
So that you'll throw me away and
hire another person to do this programme?
That means you didn't say these details
to either Indira or Bhardwaj, right?
No!
No one was aware of this until now.
This formula is also in the deeper layers of my mind.
No records, no notes, no voices, nothing.
Okay, Rudra.
You go ahead with the Park.
I mean Spark.
But take safety precautions,
it should be used only by the government.
We will support you.
Complete support.
-Sir, this is very...
Bharadwaj, you just stay quiet.
He is a genius.
We should encourage people like them.
That is culture.
Sir.
Rudra, you go.
I'll talk with them.
General.
Sir.
Take him down.
-Okay.
Sir, just now you said that he is a genius, right?
He tried to attack me on your campus,
where there are so many soldiers.
That's why I acted like I supported him.
Tit for tat!
If you had thought of all this,
you would have been a politician.
Take him into custody, know about
that formula from him, and kill him after that.
Do it very confidentially.
There shouldn't be any records showing
that a person like him was in the army.
Today is a very dark day in my life.
The whole Spark lab was destroyed
because of the attack that happened today.
In that blast, 30 soldiers and David died,
along with Rudra.
We confirmed Rudra's death through dental records.
So the Spark programme ended with Rudra's death.
No.
Rudra hasn't died yet.
I saw David three days ago.
That means David and Rudra both didn't die.
Yes.
Sir, bad news.
-What happened?
The SD card, which has all the
details of our programme, is missing.
What? How could such important
information be missed?
We terminated a girl who was making
too much noise in the last tribal camp.
Her boyfriend took it.
He's been tracking us since then.
I sent our people to kill him.
But it didn't happen.
Abdul.
-Yes!
He came to my house today.
David, what we want is one more
night and one more subject.
Subject 369.
We'll be completely ready for tomorrow's launch.
No one can stop us after that.
Sir, he finished all the private armies
that we built within a snap.
Listen to me.
It will be better if we close the lab
and go away from this city.
Idiot!
We lose only the army.
We'll build another army.
You saw it, right? The entire
government was not able to do anything.
What can he do?
However, we don't exist in the eyes of people.
Your experience is my experiment.
Soldier, where is Rudra?
Tell us, Soldier.
Terror Begins...
Oh My God!
Good bye.
Do what I say...
Do what I say...
Ok Sir.
Rambo!
Rambo!
What?
See this!
It's not as simple as we think.
I got to know who was behind these suicides.
Who?
David.
Rudra.
See...
Rudra and David made the whole
world believe that they'd died,
but they escaped and have been doing experiments.
They're using loopholes very smartly.
If a person dies of natural causes,
then a postmortem won't be done.
But if a person commits suicide, then they'll take
that body to the nearby Government hospital's mortuary ward.
And they'll send it to postmortem the next day,
stitch the body, and give it to their parents or relatives.
Their target is 18â€“25-year-old young,
healthy female brains.
Once they identify the girl, they'll try to send
the Spark formula to her in some way or another.
Okay.
There's no need for that, madam.
This is a complimentary service from our hospital.
Thank you.
There's no need for that, madam.
This is a complimentary service from our hospital.
Thank you.
Don't forget to take the tablets.
It's better if you keep alert.
Okay.
David follows that girl like a shadow.
Once she commits suicide,
David reaches her within 5 minutes
and takes her body to a mortuary ward.
They kept one mortuary ward per city under their control.
They extract that brain during the postmortem.
And They'll give bodies to parents as if they did nothing.
David gives that brain to Rudra.
Rudra does experiments on those brains.
Total of 368 innocent lives.
Durgi is also one of them.
Ananya and Kavitha were killed because
they came to know about antipsychotic drugs.
All the reports are normal.
I'll prescribe some vitamin tablets... use them.
That red box.
These are antipsychotic drugs, doctor.
What?
Why are you giving them to her?
I didn't give them. Madam did.
This is not my prescription.
Check it.
This is not mine.
-Hey! Stop!
Hey!
David!
Sir.
Too much of noise.
Make them silent.
There is something wrong.
They had already planned something big.
They wanted to bind this to the
COVID virus and spread it to the world.
If this happens, then no one can stop Rudra.
This is pure biological warfare.
The launch time is tomorrow morning at 9.
We should stop him before that.
But how?
How will we be able to know where they are?
That, too, we have to know by this night.
Go quickly and search the
locations of Neura hospitals.
Call me if you get suspicious.
Okay, done.
Are you and Lekha neura hospital patients?
Yes, I am going to the neura hospital
because she suggested
Lekha!
Lekha! Lift the call.
Hello!
Wait.. wait..
Suicide killer.
Cool! Cool!
Your work is done in Vizag.
So you've come to start here in Hyderabad?
Lekha's life is in danger, sir.
It's not as simple as you think.
Check the content on this SD card.
It has all the information you want to know.
Just tell me, where have you hidden the guns?
We might lose our jobs.
Hello!
Sir!
Are you here to arrest him
or to do the comedy skit?
Sir, check the content on this SD card.
Anand!
Sir!
Come here.
He looks like a vampire sir.
Anand, come and arrest him.
I am coming, just a minute.
I feel like he looks like a vampire.
What is this?
Take him.
Hey... Hey... don't harm me...
Hey, you coward!
Sir, please trust me one last time.
Are you playing with us?
-Please sir...
Let's go.
Take the gun.
Don't shoot.
Don't steal his gun.
He'll lose his job too.
If you move one step ahead, then I'll shoot you.
Move away!
Move! Move!
Move!
Move!
Sorry, sir.
Your guns are also in the trees. Take them.
Hey! Search for the guns.
Go.
Hello! Control room.
Ashok Reddy here.
He is wearing a brown jacket.
He is very dangerous.
He passed Kokapet Service Road.
Arrest him immediately if you see him.
Urgent! Please!
Sir, our guns...
-Okay, okay.
Come on.
Start the jeep.
Sir, let's go along with them.
There's no need for that.
Why? Will you leave him like that?
No!
He's neither a criminal nor a vampire, as you thought.
Then?
He is the same as us, searching for answers.
Let's go. Let's help him find Lekha.
Come.
Hey, don't shoot him.
I want him alive.
Jay! Surrender yourself.
Otherwise, I'll shoot you.
Don't move.
Hey! Catch him.
Damn!
Arya!
I inquired about all the neura hospitals, as you said.
But there is something wrong with
the building in Gachibowli.
They stopped the construction because it was in dispute.
I went to the place where the building
was to see what was happening.
Security was really strict.
I'm really suspicious about it.
I wanted to say something about it.
But you were not in the house.
Where did you go?
This guy...
Hey! Stop!
My vehicle!
He is running away with my clothes.
Thief!
Thief!
Catch him!
Hey! Idiot!
Don't you know that you shouldn't
smoke in dangerous zones?
Give it!
Hey!
Who is he?
He is the suicide killer.
Oh!
Suicide killer.
Why are you disturbing me like a rat?
Rudra!
I lost my life.
I lost Ananya because of you.
I won't spare you.
Hey!
Don't underestimate me based on my looks.
I'm a soldier.
I'm a soldier, man.
David, get up.
See, suicide killer.
You're not aware of my value.
That's the reason why anger and
revenge chemicals are released in your brain.
Mind control is a genius thought.
Only brilliant people will have this thought.
Mind control.
My dream and my invention.
Look...
Their death is your dream?
Inventions should strive to make people's lives better.
Doctors like you should do research to save people.
But what are you doing?
But you're trying to destroy the world by killing people,
taking out their brains, and researching them.
Is this what you call an invention?
I have no time for this.
See!
I have to combine brain chemicals and
mutate into this girl's brain.
Into this girl's brain.
I've been working here for 180 days without going out
and focusing on only one thing,
discovering a formula.
Mind control is nothing
but your foolishness and avarice.
It's malice that you want to do to mankind.
If taking one person's mind into
our control is considered malice,
then a toddler is also doing malice by controlling his
mother's mind by crying late at night to wake her up.
Now believe in Rudra as a god of science.
You're not a scientist, you're a devil.
Yes.
I'm a devil.
I'm evil.
Spark can create.
Spark can control.
I'm Spark.
Rudra.
I won't spare you.
You can't escape.
Hey! You will be killed in my hands today.
Let's see.
Arya!
You will die for sure.
Hey! I know all your tricks.
I shut down all the gas walls before coming in.
You will die for sure.
There is no use, even if you kill me.
Look over there.
She will kill you for sure, even if I won't be able to.
If possible, try to live.
But make sure you burn my brain.
Otherwise, I'll come back.
Once this formula is injected,
there is only one way to save the person.
I believe that their brain will come out of the hallucination
once they believe that they killed themselves.
Lekha!
Lekha!
Lekha!
Somebody please help me.
Arya, please help me.
They kidnapped me along with Lekha.
Thank you.
Where is he?
-Here...
Arya is here.
How is Lekha?
She is out of danger.
Her heartbeat has become stable now.
But she is unconscious.
You can meet her once she regains consciousness.
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.
Arya, don't ask me anything.
Lekha is your responsibility from today.
She used to tell us that someone was appearing
in her dreams and that she wanted to meet her.
She used to tell us that every dream has a meaning.
Are you here to save her?
Grandma, I was her dream until yesterday.
But for me, she is my present.
And she is the future's life.
A proud woman of India,
The great Neuropsychiatrist
Neura Hospital Chief Dr. Indira...
is going to Sweden to receive the Nobel Prize.
Arya!
-Jay!
I'll be back.
Okay.
Arya!
Lekha is fine, right?
Yes. She is fine.
Thank God. I'm at peace now.
The war is not over yet.
There's something else that I have to finish.
We'll be at peace only after it finishes.
What do you mean?
Arya!
I hope this prize brings more visibility to our work.
The field of neuropsychiatry.
And hopefully more funds too.
And thank you very much for your wishes.
Thank you.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Someone named Arya wants to meet you urgently.
I told him that it wouldn't be possible now,
but he said he wants to meet you now,
otherwise, you'll be in danger.
Excuse me!
Hello Madam!
-Thank you.
Hello Arya!
Renu said something very important.
Take your seat.
You didn't expect that you'd meet me again, right?
It all happened because of you, right?
Otherwise, I wouldn't be...
Why think badly at this auspicious moment?
Okay. Lekha is fine, right?
Lekha is fine, madam.
But there are so many innocent people like Lekha.
I couldn't save any of them.
Very sad.
Anyway, you ensured that this circumstance
wouldn't arise again by ensuring Rudra's death.
Rudra is just a pawn in chess.
But the grandmaster is still alive.
That means, who is the grandmaster?
Excuse me! Give us 5 minutes.
You all...
Sorry.
What do you mean?
Who is the grandmaster?
I didn't understand when Rudra said
that he's been in the lab for 180 days,
he'll get the subjects to his table,
and he only does research.
I gave it some thought afterwards.
Then I understood that there
was a missing link in this chain.
I need some details regarding Dr.Indira.
Waiting...
You got to know about Rudra when you first met
that you and Rudra think the same.
We attack ourselves via hallucination.
- via hallucination.
You decided to use Rudra.
2016 December.
Rudra made the whole world
believe that he died in a lab attack.
But you were the one who helped him escape.
David!
-Yes, ma'am.
Soldiers are coming to terminate Rudra.
Be prepared!
Okay, ma'am.
Okay.
Welcome, Rudra.
Do whatever research you want to do.
I will get you the subjects that you want.
You concentrate on cracking the spark formula.
You're dead to the Indian government.
No one will disturb you.
Thank you, madam.
In January 2017, you opened the
first branch of Neura Hospital in Delhi.
Within one month of that Delhi saw
a surge in the cases of suicide killings.
In January 2018, you started the
second branch in Kolkata.
The suicide killings cases stopped
in Delhi but started in Kolkata.
In 2019, Mumbai.
In 2020, Bangalore.
In 2021, Vizag. And in 2022, Hyderabad.
You were present in each of those cities
and you opened your Hospitals in each of those places.
Out of all the victims, 368 people
were Neura Hospitals patients
or Neura Hospitals sponsored
medical camp patients, madam.
Even the smartest criminal
will leave behind some traces.
The CCTV fixed in front of your house
belongs to the GHMC.
Look at this picture.
David.
He came to your house two days
before the death of Actress Aradhana,
and he came out with the file from the neura hospital.
The file's number is visible if you look at it carefully.
Patient file number 00238.
Look at this picture.
The person in this picture is also David.
He came to your house exactly two
days before the death of Harshita
and came out with the file from the neura hospital.
Not just Aradhana, every single patient,
every single person,
every single one of those 368 subjects..
you are the one who shortlisted them, madam.
You are the one who gave the files to David,
and you are the one who helped Rudra, madam.
Here! This is subject 369 that you asked.
Will the formula get completed with this subject?
Wait and see.
Please help me.
They kidnapped me too, along with Lekha.
Hence proved, madam.
Rudra is the body, and you're the brain.
Hence proved, madam.
Rudra is the pawn, and you're the grandmaster.
Punishment for the guilty is inevitable, madam.
In the year 1971...
My father died for our country when
there was a war between India and Pakistan.
I was 2 years old then.
I didn't cry growing up for my
father because he died for our country.
I used to think with my scientific brain
about how to save our nation.
I learned about Steve Gottlieb
after I became a doctor.
MK-Ultra, what a great invention!
I wanted to turn myself into a powerful
army for our country through MK-Ultra.
I don't think there was anything wrong with that.
Of course, things happen.
I don't think I have to say anything
specifically about collateral damage.
When I desire to accomplish anything big,
it doesn't bother me when minor setbacks occur.
Do you think 368 lives are collateral damage?
Arya!
Don't look at me as if I'm a traitor.
All I did was for our country.
With patriotism.
See! I had to sacrifice my personal life too.
Because everything has a price.
Tell me your price.
Tell me what you want.
Will you give me what I want?
-Yes.
Ananya.
Will you give Ananya to me?
I know it's really hard to show
your real face to the world.
You're an experienced person.
So I'm leaving it to you to decide
what you want to do next.
Arya Jayadev has proved that the
medical mafia is behind...
the series of suicides in different
states of our country since 2016.
He is not a normal person.
Good!
I've been watching this place since childhood.
Shall we go on our honeymoon here?
Yeah! But why did you directly come
to talk about your honeymoon?
Ananya, I didn't let anyone live
who was the reason for your death.
But I didn't think that I had
to fulfil your wish in this way.
Sorry.
Rest in peace, Ananya.
You idiot!
Did you think that I was dead?
How many times should I search for you?
People say that if our will is strong,
then even dreams become true.
This is the SPARK that happened in our lives.
