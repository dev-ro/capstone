- Hello,jefe.
- You're late for the ceremony.
- They still up in the squad room?
- Yeah.
Lieutenant Thomas will be
in charge of this precinct...
and no one else.
So far as you are concerned,
he has no superiors.
You'll give him
your cooperation...
and your obedience.
And I expect this precinct to maintain its
present high record with the department...
under your new lieutenant.
Do you wish to make
any remarks, Lieutenant?
I'll talk to the men
individually.
Good idea.
Dixon, I want to talk to you.
I'll use your office, Thomas.
- Yes, sir.
- That's all, boys.
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Good luck, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.
Sit down, Dixon.
We've had 12 more legitimate
citizen complaints against you this month.
For assault and battery.
From who? Hoods, dusters, mugs?
A lot of nickel rats.
You're a big disappointment
to me, Dixon.
You've just seen a man who started out
at the same time you did...
take a big step up
in the department...
which is something you'll never do
unless you get hold of yourself.
I know what to get hold of, sir.
A little more pull.
Sit still!
You've gotta learn, Dixon, what's
expected of a police officer and what isn't.
Yes, sir. I'll try to learn
not to hate hoods so much.
You don't hate hoodlums.
You like to beat them up.
You get fun out of it.
You like to read about yourself
in the newspapers...
as the tough cop who isn't
afraid to weigh it in anywhere.
Your job is to detect criminals,
not to punish them.
Is that all, sir?
I'm reducing your rank, Dixon.
You're going back
to second grade.
Any more complaints against you
for cruelty or roughhouse...
and you'll be back in uniform
pounding a beat.
It's no fun
telling you this.
You're a good man
with a good brain.
But you're no good to the department
unless you learn to control yourself.
All right,
you can go now.
Thank you, sir,
for the advice.
Hey, Willie? Willie!
How you feelin',
Willie?
Feelin' fine, thanks.
Don't you think you better be in bed,
Willie?
Parole rules allow me till 12:00.
I got 20 minutes yet.
How's Mr. Scalise,
Willie?
What are you tryin'
to do, trap me?
I ain't consortin' with no questionable
characters, and nobody can prove that I am.
That's a nice boy.
You'd better get to bed. It's good for you.
Sure.
- Who is it?
- Willie.
It's my point. Come on. Eight the hard way.
- Two fours.
- Seven the loser.
You're very lucky tonight,
Mr. Morrison.
Must be the little lady
brought me luck.
- Your dice, Mr. Paine.
- Pass.
- Your dice, Mr. Morrison.
- Okay, I'll shoot 3,000.
- I'll take one.
- I'll take 500 of it.
I'll take the rest.
You're covered.
- Hello.
- Care to join our game, Mr. Bender?
- Sure, sure.
- How are things?
- Oh, fine.
- Six.
- Bumped into a couple of old friends of ours.
Dixon and Klein.
They asked about you.
- But I think they're too busy to drop in.
- Too bad.
All right. Come on, dice.
Give it to me. A six right back.
- Here we go! Six!
- Ten.
Mr. Morrison is from Texas.
He's very rich.
Here, you breathe on 'em.
Oh, that'll do it. Now you got
Lady Luck ridin' with you, dice.
This is it! A six!
Give it to me!
There it is! A six!
- And getting richer.
- Six is my lucky number.
I'll shoot
the whole 6,000.
You taking any, gentlemen?
- A grand.
- Same here.
Four open.
You're covered, Mr. Morrison.
I like your friends, Mr. Paine.
Can't get better action than this in Amarillo.
All right, dice, now we're
goin' for the big money.
Well, what do you know-a seven!
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home, Mr. Morrison.
- Morgan.
- Ken, you know I have to be at work at 8:30.
Well, that's right.
You can't keep a workin' girl up all hours.
Then I'll take you
home, Morgan.
We'll all go together.
I'll get your things.
There you are.
- Mr. Morrison?
- Yes, sir.
You're 19 grand into us.
Well, that's all right.
You'll get it back some other night.
I ain't leavin' town
for a week.
Tell him you changed your mind.
You want to stay.
No, Ken. I told you I could
only stay until midnight.
- But you can't do this to me.
- I'm not doing anything to you.
I brought him here.
Oh. So that's it.
Yes, that's it. And you're
foulin' me up again.
That's all you ever do
is foul me up!
You're telling him to stay!
- No, I'm not.
- Why, you-
Morgan.
You heel!
16th Precinct, address: 43rd Street Hotel...
3 7 2-C West 43rd Street.
Cars 618, 619 and 12,
proceed immediately.
- That's us.
- Hello, Sergeant.
- Hi.
- Foley.
- Hi, Sarge.
Hi.
- Vice joint, huh?
- Yeah. Floater.
- Get his name?
- Morrison. Big barracuda.
He was D.O.A.
Knife cut his heart in half.
Nobody did it.
Nobody saw it.
There's a cut
on his hand.
Yeah, he hit somebody hard.
Who runs this parlor?
Tommy Scalise.
He's in there.
Oh, that's nice. Our dream boy
finally stepped into something, huh?
I've been waiting quite a while.
Should've gone home to bed,
Willie, like you were told.
You'd be asleep now,
with no parole troubles.
I live in this hotel.
I just dropped in for a cigarette.
How do you do,
Mr. Scalise?
Where did you hide
the knife, dream boy?
Go easy, Dixon.
Keep your hands off me.
- Talk.
- Wise up, Mr. Dixon.
You made a monkey of yourself two years ago,
tryin' to hang somethin' on me.
Who killed him-
you or one of your playmates?
You find a corpse, and
right away I'm a killer.
- You've been a killer for a long time.
- Have I?
As I remember it,
the jury found me innocent.
And they weren't out
more than 15 minutes.
You're still a killer.
What are you always tryin'
to push me in the gutter for?
I got as much right
on the sidewalk as you have.
Don't talk to me about rights.
You're a hood and a murderer.
You're a pretty smart rat, Scalise,
but this is your off night.
What are you always
jumpin' after me for, Dixon?
Four years,jumpin' after me
like I was somebody special.
- Why?
- That's right.
Getting you is a special job of mine.
- I can't figure you out. Your father liked me-
- Shut up!
- Hello, Lieutenant.
Find anything, Dixon?
I've been waiting to tell you
what happened, Lieutenant.
Take them outside.
We'll question them later.
Congratulations
on your promotion, Lieutenant.
Okay, okay, let's have it.
Mr. Morrison was brought here
by a fellow named Ken Paine.
Sort of an acquaintance
of mine.
There was a girl with him.
I, uh, didn't quite get her name.
A Morgan something.
Mr. Morrison wanted
a little friendly play.
How much did he win?
He didn't win.
He lost.
- You're lying, Scalise.
- Let's hear his story first, Dixon.
He lost a grand or so,
but he didn't care.
He was makin' a play for this girl,
showin' his stuff.
Paine was jealous.
He hit the girl first...
smacked her hard in the face,
and she ran out.
Then Morrison tackled Paine.
Morrison pulled a gun...
but Paine had him so he couldn't shoot,
and they wrestled into the bedroom.
Before I could call the cops,
Paine came out.
He didn't say anything.
Just left.
Then Morrison came out
and fell on the floor.
He was dead
when I got to him.
What did you do
with the knife?
There wasn't any weapon.
Paine must've taken it along.
You're lying, Scalise.
Let me handle him, Lieutenant.
- What is Paine's address?
- I don't know.
K. Paine, 58 Pike Street,
Chelsea 3-2099.
Another telephone number:
Murray Hill 5-997 0. What's that?
A pool room
on Third Avenue.
I'm sure you won't have any trouble
picking him up. He was blind.
All neat and ready
with a fall guy, huh?
- Let me handle him, Lieutenant.
- Go after Paine, Dixon.
Come on, Paul.
Keep the change.
Yeah, Ted Morrison.
Kenneth Paine calling.
Don't answer? Maybe he's in the bar.
Have him paged.
But I gotta talk to him.
It's important.
Tryin' to get Ted Morrison
on the phone, huh?
Who are you?
Detective Dixon,
16th Squad.
Get out.
Maybe he's tryin'
to win his money back.
Don't give me that.
He was cleanin' up.
- How much?
- And he's gotta cut me in.
After what you did to him?
He started it.
It's all among friends.
Hello? What? He isn't?
Well, look, Kenneth Paine wants him
to call as soon as he comes in.
No, that's all right.
I said get out.
I don't like cops.
Ted Morrison is not
gonna call you back, Paine.
Nobody asked you.
Somebody sunk a knife
into Morrison. He's dead.
Dead? You're lyin'.
Scalise is trying to frame you.
Says you knifed him.
Go home.
Look, I'm tryin'
to help you, Paine.
Scalise and his boys
are hanging a murder on you.
They knocked him off to get their
dough back after you left. Come on.
Go on! No cop's
gonna touch me!
- Stand up alone then.
- I'll stand up when I want to.
Get outta here.
Get out!
Okay, buddy.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mark?
- Oh, hello, Paul.
- Did you find him?
Mark? Mark?
Hello? Hello?
Operator, there's a bad connection.
Get this line cleared.
- Mark, can you hear me?
- Yeah.
I picked up some stuff on him I thought you
oughta hear. Go easy on him. He's a war hero.
Got a hat full of medals
and a lot of newspaper friends.
When he first got out of the service,
he wrote a syndicated column.
I thought I'd tell you so you don't
muss him up if you run into him.
Gonna wait there
for him?
Yeah, I'll stick around
in case he shows up.
So long.
Will you send a cab
to 58 Pike Street, please.
- Did you call a cab?
- No, not me.
- Pennsylvania Station, please.
- Yes, sir.
A ticket to Pittsburgh,
the first train out.
Seventeen dollars
and eight cents.
Hello, Paul. I covered
a few bars in the neighborhood.
I just got here.
See this?
Slipped in and out
after I was here.
Probably watching you.
Nice piece of luck for me.
You can't be everywhere.
Got all his stuff out of this closet
kinda quick.
Left his uniform
and one shoe.
- There's another closet.
Nothing in there.
It's empty.
Maybe somebody saw him get away.
There's an old lady in the window downstairs.
We're from the police.
We'd like to talk to you.
What do you want?
How long have you
been sitting here?
Since after dinner.
I always sit here at night.
- Do you know Kenneth Paine?
- Oh, yes, I know him.
- Have you seen him tonight?
- Yes. He left in a taxi.
- When?
- I don't know.
When you get old like me,
you don't care what time it is.
Approximately
how long ago?
About 20 minutes, I think.
The taxi man woke me up.
Everybody wakes me up tonight.
Usually I can sleep here.
I always sleep here
since my husband died.
It seems less lonely.
Music helps me.
Thank you, madam.
Come on, Paul.
That's all.
Thank you.
- He's running for it, huh?
- We'll get him.
You cover the Yellow Cab stand.
See if you can pick up the driver.
- I'll cover all the independent garages.
- Okay.
Paine! Open up!
I know you're in there!
Open up, you dirty rat!
Open-
- Where's the lieutenant?
- Sign this. He's in there.
- Right.
- Lieutenant?
- Yes?
- We got a break on this.
One of the porters saw Paine
stick it in a locker.
Oh, good.
Here's the cab driver's
statement.
" Picked up a fare at 58 Pike Street
around 1:10.''
- Is that right?
- That's right.
Do you recognize
this bag?
Yeah, the guy was carryin' it
when he came out of the house.
I noticed the name.
Kenneth something.
Yeah, Kenneth Paine.
He had a bandage
under one eye, huh?
- Yeah, piece of tape.
- Which eye?
Under the...
left eye, like this.
Under the left eye.
Thanks. You can go.
We know where to get you.
Looks like we have a definite
line on Paine, Lieutenant.
A ticket agent at Penn Station remembers
selling him a ticket to Pittsburgh.
Evidently trying
to throw us off.
He's probably holed up
in town somewhere.
- No line on the girl yet, Lieutenant.
- Well, keep calling, Vincent.
Scalise thinks she was
either an actress or a model.
- Call the agencies on both
as soon as they open in the morning.
- Okay.
Call C.B. and have them Teletype
Paine's description to Pittsburgh.
Dixon, take yourself a rest.
You too, Klein.
- Then get busy on the hotels.
- Communication, please.
I'm going home
for a couple of hours.
Knock off, Casey,
and then report back at 8:00.
Good night, boys.
Teletype the following
description to Pittsburgh.
- Age about 36.
- Give me Communication.
Complexion dark.
Height 6'1'', weight 180 pounds.
- Hair dark, build average.
You look beat, Mark.
Don't you feel good?
- Hey, Mark,you awake?
- Hey, Mark,you awake?
- Yeah.
- We got a line on the girl.
Her name is Morgan Taylor. Lives up in
Washington Heights. I got her phone number.
- What is it?
- Bosworth 3-5098.
Bosworth 3-5098.
All right, all right.
- Hello?
- Does Miss Morgan Taylor live there?
Yeah, she lives here.
No, she ain't in now.
She's gone to work. Who's calling?
Never mind.
I'll call her later.
She's gone to work. Have you
got her employment address?
Here it is.
Friedman and Lyon,
525 Eighth Avenue.
Very nice.
But too high-styled for my customers.
Maybe we could make
a little bolero, Oleg.
Well, I'll sketch it.
Mm, I'm not sure.
I'll let you know when I send the order in.
Thank you, Morgan.
It's all right with me.
We have more orders than
we can fill on this number.
- Did they notice it?
- I don't think so.
Come here.
Let me see it in the light.
It still shows a little.
I better put
some more pancake on it.
You know, Morgan, it's your own fault.
Hold that.
You keep thinking of him
as a glamour boy.
You won't see him
for what he is...
which is
definitely a jerk.
So he won the war
and freed the slaves.
Does that entitle him
to spend the rest of his life...
drinking barrels of whiskey
and punching girls in the nose?
Don't worry.
- I'm not going to see him anymore.
- You said that before.
So he rolls his
alcoholic eyes at you...
and you set yourself up
for another left hook.
You can't help him, Morgan.
I guess you're right.
- There's someone to see you, Miss Taylor.
- Oh, tell him to drop dead.
It's important. Mr. Friedman said
to come to the office right away.
Miss Taylor, this is
Mr. Dixon and Mr. Klein.
They are police detectives.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Would you sit down,
please, Miss Taylor.
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.
What would you like to know?
You were with
Kenneth Paine last night?
- Yes.
- You were at a so-called
"floating crap game''...
in the apartment of a man
named Scalise at the 43rd Street Hotel.
- Is that right?
- Yes.
- Have you been in touch
with Paine this morning?
- No.
- Have you any idea where he might be?
- No, I haven't.
From what we hear,
you're pretty well acquainted with Paine.
- Yes.
- How well? Tell us, please.
- I'm his wife.
- Is that so?
But, uh, you're living with
your father, we understand.
Ken and I separated
three months ago.
What happened at Scalise's
while you were there?
May I know why you're
asking me all these questions?
We'd rather tell you afterward,
if you don't mind.
Well, Kenneth was drinking,
and we had a quarrel.
I understand he hit you.
Yes.
- Did you see him hit Morrison?
- No, I didn't. I left.
- Where'd you go?
- Home.
Take a taxi?
No. I met my father at his stand
a block from the hotel.
He's a taxi driver.
He drove me to the subway.
- Did you hear from Paine after you got home?
- Yes, he telephoned.
- What'd he say?
- I don't know. I hung up.
- What time was that?
- About 12:30.
- Did he call from his house?
- No.
How do you know, if you hung up
without talking to him?
Because my father went down to
Ken's place after he dropped me.
- What for?
- Really, is this necessary?
We think so, Miss Taylor.
Well, l- I didn't
want to tell him anything.
But I was crying,
and he noticed the bruise.
- What'd he say?
- He was very angry. He told me before that-
What?
Well, that if Ken ever hit me
again, he'd beat his head off.
Morrison was killed
last night.
No?
At Scalise's place,
shortly after you left.
He was killed with a knife.
And you're looking for Ken
because you think he did it?
When did your husband
start getting jealous of Mr. Morrison?
Jealous? That's silly. Mr. Morrison
was somebody I hardly knew.
- But you went out with him.
- No, Ken called me up
and asked me out to dinner.
You just said you were
separated from your husband.
Yes, but he kept insisting,
and I felt sorry for him.
When I got to the restaurant,
he had Mr. Morrison with him.
Then after dinner, Ken took us
to this gambling place.
And then I realized
all he wanted to see me for...
was to use me as a sort of decoy
to help get Mr. Morrison to go there.
That was sinking
pretty low, I thought.
Poor Ken. He must be
desperate for money.
- Why did Paine hit you?
- Because I wanted to go home.
He didn't want
Mr. Morrison to leave.
- Because Morrison was winning?
- Yes.
- How much was he ahead?
- A great deal.
I think they said
about 19,000.
Thank you for the information.
We won't bother you any longer.
Hi!
Well, hi. How are you?
- Hello,Jack.
- Hello, Morgan.
- Night-night, Mary. See you around.
- Night.
Miss Taylor.
- Hello.
- Good evening.
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Have you found Ken?
- No.
- You think I know where
he's hiding and won't tell.
- Where are you going now?
- Home.
Would you mind
if I came along?
That's a nice way of putting it when
you're out to give me the third degree.
This is no third degree.
This is strictly off the record.
Have you come to nab me
as a gambling house habitué?
I'm not really. I've never been
in one of those places before.
Are you-Are you having
dinner with anyone?
- You inviting me?
- Yes.
I take that subway there.
It'll take me a few minutes to change.
That's good enough.
- Hey, Dad. You home?
- I'm cookin
- There's company.
- Paine?
No.
This is my father,
Mr. Dixon.
- Mark Dixon.
- Glad to know you.
You don't remember me, huh?
I'm Jiggs Taylor.
I'm sorry.
I don't recall.
Excuse me.
I'll get ready.
Well, sit down.
I'll tell you about it.
It's 2:00 a.m. I'm cruisin'
through Central Park.
There's a blizzard goin' on.
A detective jumps in my cab and says,
"Follow that black sedan. It's full of thieves.''
So I give her the gas.
Here. Here's the diploma
the mayor gave me.
" For aiding Detective Mark Dixon
in a time of danger.''
Oh,yes. Six years ago.
Say, Dad, let's hear about how they opened
fire and riddled your cab with bullets.
Well, Mark can tell you himself.
Can't you, Mark?
Yes, there were a few shots fired,
as I remember.
A few shots? Dad always claimed
it was a bigger battle than the Argonne.
That's the trouble with
the new generation- no respect.
- How about a drink, Mark?
- No, thanks.
On duty, huh?
I suppose you're workin'
on that Morrison killing.
- That's right.
- Cigarette?
Thanks.
Any other suspects
besides Ken?
That fella Scalise, huh?
I've heard about him.
The department thinks
he's clean on that job.
He's been released on bail
on a gambling charge only.
But you got
your own ideas, huh?
In the first place, he lied about Morrison
being loser when the game broke up.
Your daughter says
he was about 19,000 ahead.
It looks like a cinch
he's the guy!
I wouldn't tell a lot of people about going up
to Paine's place last night to beat him up.
I don't care how many people hear it.
He's had it coming to him for some time.
Oh, Dad, please.
Mr. Dixon isn't interested in my life story.
I ask you, what would you do
if you had a son-in-law like that?
You know, it is a lucky thing
I didn't find him in last night.
I'd have-
Oh, I forgot to ask you.
I've been so excited
over meetin' you again.
How about some chow?
I got enough for three.
No, Dad.
We're going out.
Well, we could
talk over old times.
I'll be seeing you, Mr. Taylor.
Nice meeting you again.
Well, at least I'm glad
she's goin' out with somebody...
who ain't gonna land her
up to her neck in crooks.
You're horrible, Dad.
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.
Have fun, kids.
Good evening, Mr. Detective.
Where've you been hangin' out?
- Hello, Martha.
- Good evening.
How do you do?
You know, I like
places like this...
that specialize in good food
instead of headwaiters.
It's the worst food
in town.
But don't worry. They usually serve
a stomach pump with the dessert.
Who invited you to come
to my restaurant, Mr. Detective?
- Not me.
- Martha's the head of a ring of burglars.
My presence
makes her nervous.
Yeah, last night we got a whole basket
full of diamonds. You wanna see?
Bring us two of your
dangerous dinners, Martha.
- You know how much I've been
offered to poison this man?
- Ten dollars.
That's right.
I'm holdin' out for 15.
Two dinners.
Do you want wine?
- Bring a small bottle.
- Huh. Same old cheapskate.
She adores you,
doesn't she?
- She ought to. I sent her husband up.
- Was he really a burglar?
- Wife beater.
- Oh, she's wonderful.
But she's under wraps tonight
on account of you.
I don't usually eat here
with a dame. Oh, I mean-
Dame's all right. I imagine
you bring your wife here.
- There's no such animal.
- Oh? My dad told me you were married.
Your dad is not a reliable
source of information.
You're quite right. I never knew
anybody who tells so many lies.
He does it for fun though. He's always
driving kings and queens or movie stars...
and overhearing the most
amazing conversations.
- Like your dad, huh?
- Crazy about him.
I hope you come here
often,young lady.
For five years, this man sits in
my restaurant frightenin' everybody away.
A detective in the window.
You can imagine how people wanna come in.
But now, with a beautiful lady,
he looks almost human.
- How's the soup?
- Horrible.
- It's very good.
- Thanks. Eat all you want.
Have you been trying
to get in touch with Paine?
No. I don't quite
know what to do.
- When were you married?
- After he came back from the war.
But we knew each other
before that.
You said this morning
you were separated.
- Three months ago.
- Why?
It's hard to say
why you leave a man...
or why you
stop loving him.
I always blamed Ken,
but I guess it was my fault too-
not understanding what made him
seem so mean and impossible.
I guess the chief thing
wrong with Ken was no job.
And lots of pride.
Too much pride.
A man can usually
find work if he wants to.
You're worried about me feeling badly because
he's going to be arrested, aren't you?
Something like that.
I think I'll stick
by him if he is.
He'll need me.
I owe it to him.
You still love him, huh,
in spite of everything?
No. It isn't love
anymore.
Mr. Detective, telephone!
Excuse me.
That must be my partner.
Probably wants to know
what I'm eating.
Dixon speaking.
Been tryin' to get you for an hour, Mark.
Big doings. We found Paine.
Where did you find him?
River watchman reported to
the 6th Precinct down here that
somebody slugged him last night.
He just punched his clock
at 3:00 a.m.
We sent a couple of men
over to talk to him...
but they couldn't make head or tail
of the slugging- nothing stolen-
till the watchman remembered
the man held something like a body.
We started dragging the river
and brought up Paine a half hour ago.
- Who's that?
- Mark.
Mark? Thomas. We found Paine
in the river with his skull cracked.
We'll meet you at his apartment
in 15 minutes. Be there.
Okay, Lieutenant.
- What's the matter? You look sick.
- Give me the check.
You gotta leave the beautiful girl
just when she's beginning to like you.
That's what you get
for bein' a detective.
No fun. Always chasin'
the wrong people.
- Did something happen?
- I've gotta go out on a job.
Please finish your dinner.
It's really very nice.
- Best chicken and rice in town.
- I'm sorry you have to leave.
- Thanks.
- So long.
- Bye.
- Good night.
You like him, huh?
- I think he's very nice.
- I'm glad.
You know what that
fellow needs? A family.
He's got nobody.
All he thinks of day and night is his job.
He grabs himself a dizzy blonde
once in a while, but that's no life.
A fellow like him oughta be married...
to a beautiful girl.
- Have a home, kids and-
- You're wasting your propaganda, Martha.
- I'm married.
- Buzzin' a married woman.
Wait till I see
that dope again.
- You got it?
- It's blood all right.
Quite fresh. I'd say
not more than 2 4 hours.
- Get it to the lab right away.
- Okay.
That clinches it.
Paine was killed in his room.
Somebody came in there
and slugged him.
He bumped his head
on the floor when he fell.
He had a silver plate in his head
as a result of a shrapnel wound in the war.
- The fall must've killed him.
- I buy that, Lieutenant.
The killer tried to get the body out,
but he was surprised by someone.
Probably Dixon when he
came through the front door.
He ducked behind the staircase
here and hid the body.
That's the reason for
the blood stain on the wall.
If it is Paine's blood.
We'll get the lab
report shortly.
Now, we can establish
the time of the killing...
between 12:30, when
Paine must've got here...
and 3:00 a.m., when the killer
knocked out the watchman on the pier.
- Hello, Dixon.
You know Mr. Gilruth
from the D.A. 's office.
- Sure. How are ya?
- Hello.
A lot of fancy footwork you did
last night, Dixon-you and Mr. Paine.
That couldn't be helped,
Lieutenant.
I can't understand
how you didn't see him.
You came in here at 12:50.
Klein talked to you on the phone.
- That's right.
- Paine came in and packed
and got out at 1:10.
That's when the taxi
picked him up.
So you must have practically
passed each other.
Well, he wasn't here, so I thought
he might be doing some drinking.
I had a look
in a couple of bars.
That's a queer way to figure- a guy on
the lam is going to be sitting around bars.
- What time did Dixon come back here?
- About 1:50.
- And you left again right after that?
- That's right.
- We started chasing Paine.
- It's obvious.
He lays a fake trail, he goes
to the Pennsylvania Station...
and then he decides to come back
and hide in his own apartment.
He figures the police have been there,
and they won't come looking again.
What time did Jiggs Taylor
say he was here?
- About 2:15.
- That pretty well puts
the finger on him, I'd say.
Yeah, and he came down here
crazy angry, according to his daughter...
ready to knock
Paine's block off.
- You're wasting your time on Taylor.
- How is that, Dixon?
It looks completely definite-
motive, opportunity.
- Scalise did it.
- I don't see that at all, Dixon.
I'm telling you,
Scalise knifed Morrison.
Then he was afraid Paine
would go to the police with it...
so he sent someone after him
to finish him off.
That doesn't stand up.
Whoever killed Paine
killed him by accident.
He only meant
to slug him.
A Scalise hood would have taken
no chances on a rumpus.
He'd have knifed
or shot him.
- Yes, Benson?
- We've gotJiggs Taylor
and his daughter outside.
Bring them in, Harrington.
Has he been talking?
A mile a minute. Keeps thinking
he was going to a picnic.
I think we can wrap
the case up tonight...
with statements
from both of them.
- I'm Lt. Thomas.
- How do you do?
How are you doin',
Lieutenant?
I was expectin' this.
As I told the boys on the way down...
the minute I heard
Ken was murdered...
I knew I was in
for a going over...
havin' been
at the scene of the crime.
You were already for us
with your story, huh?
Won't take long.
Save you a lot of time.
Give it to you without you
having to pump me-
everything that happened.
I came down here
last night around 2:15...
Iookin' for my son-in-law.
You were pretty
worked up, huh?
I'll say.
I told him last month...
if he ever laid a hand on Morgan
again, I'd slap him silly.
Go on. Go on.
Let's have it all,Jiggs.
Well, that's all there was.
The door was unlocked.
I walk in, look around...
nobody home,
so I walk out.
With his body?
- Whose body?
- Paine's.
That's sure smart
figurin', Lieutenant.
- I tell you all-
- Never mind the lies,Jiggs.
We've got
every one of your moves.
You took the body to the river, knocked out
the watchman and dropped Paine in the water.
Oh, so I knocked out
a watchman too, huh?
That's fine.
Okay, now let me tell you somethin'.
I didn't see Paine.
If I had seen him,
I'd have taken a poke at him.
I ain't denyin' that.
He deserved it.
But I left this place
two minutes after I got here...
and I picked up a fare
three minutes later on the corner.
Congressman Reynolds.
Took him up to the Astor Hotel.
- Told me-
- Check on that, Klein.
- Yes, sir.
- Sure, check.
Check all you want.
And what time do you claim
you got to the Astor Hotel,Jiggs?
- Around 2:40.
- Anybody see you around there?
Yeah. Uh, Pat Rafferty
and Haime Berg.
They're taxi drivers.
The congressman doesn't answer in
his room. Want me to run him down?
No. No, we'll check later.
The pier watchman was slugged at 3:00 a.m.,
according to the report.
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm, yes.
That gives Jiggs Taylor 20 minutes
between 2:40 and 3:00...
to come back here from
the Astor Hotel and do his stuff.
He couldn't have come back here
from the Astor, killed Paine...
lugged the body out to the car,
driven down to the pier...
and slugged
the night watchman by 3:00.
Couldn't have done all that
in 20 minutes.
It looks like we're
on the wrong man, Lieutenant...
especially if the congressman
backs up his story.
It's not the wrong man.
If Paine was already dead at 2:15...
and Taylor came and got the body
at that time and stuck it in the
back compartment of his car-
Well, that's screwy!
I told you I picked up Congressman Reynolds.
Sure, you did.
But you were on the way to the river to dump
Paine's body when Reynolds hailed you.
He took him to the hotel.
Twenty minutes was time enough...
to scoop back the pier, slug the watchman
at 3:00 a.m. and drop Paine's body.
Paine was out ofhere at 1:10,
according to the old lady downstairs.
We're just wasting time,
Lieutenant.
I don't think so, Dixon.
Bring them along.
Did you see anybody coming
out of that building...
carrying something
over his shoulder?
- Like a large bundle.
- I didn't see anything like that.
- I'll take over, Casey.
- She says she didn't notice anyone-
Never mind.
I'm going to ask you a very
important question, Mrs. Tribaum.
Are you sure it was Kenneth Paine
you saw leaving this house at 1:10?
Of course I'm sure.
I never heard so many foolish questions.
I'm going to try a little experiment,
Mrs. Tribaum.
Taylor, I want you to put on
this raincoat and hat.
What for?
Put adhesive tape under his eye,
somebody, to match Paine's description.
Oh, no, wait a second!
What's all this for?
Now, don't act dumb, Taylor.
It won't get you anywhere.
Last night, you put on
Paine's coat and hat...
and carried his bag
out of here at 1:10...
after you'd killed him and
stuck his body away somewhere.
Do you wanna come clean
now,Jiggs?
Well, I told you the truth.
- Then put the coat on.
- Don't do it, Dad.
They have no right
to ask you to do that.
No, I won't. I ain't goin' in
for any of these monkey shines.
All right. Dixon, you're about his build.
Put the hat and coat on.
Oh, that's comic strip
stuff, Lieutenant.
The lady said she saw
Paine leave here last night.
Sure, I did. I saw Mr. Paine
out of the window.
No, you saw a raincoat,
a hat and a bag.
Go ahead, Dixon.
- Anybody got some adhesive tape?
- Here.
Under the left eye.
Mrs. Tribaum, did he walk straight
to the car, or did he look down at you?
- He looked down.
- Dixon, take the bag.
Just walk to the car
and look down once.
Now, is this
where you were sitting?
No, I was standing here
closing the window.
A taxi driver had asked me
if I'd called a cab.
Are you sure you could recognize
a face at that distance, Mrs. Tribaum?
I can tell that fellow
isn't Mr. Paine.
Can you distinguish
his face in this light?
No, but I can tell
by something else.
It isn't Mr. Paine.
- By what?
- He didn't wave at me.
- Did Mr. Paine always wave at you?
- Always.
He went like this.
What about last night?
Did he wave at you last night?
Do you remember?
Yes, I remember.
He didn't wave last night.
You're right.
It wasn't Mr. Paine.
No, never.
He would have waved.
Thank you, Mrs. Tribaum.
That's it, boys.
Take him to the station and book him.
- Well, you're kidding.
- Nobody's kidding, Taylor.
You thought you were pretty fancy
walking off as Paine at 1:10.
Then you came and got
the dead body at 2:15...
and dropped Congressman Reynolds
at the Astor at 2:40...
and hurried it
back to the pier.
- Well, that's screwy! I tell you, l-
- Take him along, boys.
- I'd like to talk to my father.
- Go ahead.
- May I talk to him alone?
- Can't be done. He's under arrest.
Dad, please.
Did you see Ken last night?
So help me.
I swear by your ma I never saw him
or laid a hand on him.
I believe you.
Will you take Miss Taylor home, Casey.
We're knocking off for tonight.
I'd rather go alone,
if I may.
I've been looking for you
for an hour, Mark.
Scotch and water, Bill.
You gotta hand it to Thomas.
He wrapped this one up quick.
His first job too. I didn't
think he had it in him.
Stop talking like an idiot.
He bungled it.
Oh, wait a minute, Mark.
That ain't fair.
Don't tell me what's fair.
I know. Scalise did it.
Scalise did both jobs-
Morrison and Paine.
You can't go against
the facts, Mark.
I'll betJiggs Taylor'll confess
the whole job in a day or two.
- See you later.
- Where are you going?
I'm going to get it
out of Scalise.
Wait a minute, Mark.
You're not on that end of it.
- You know the boss's orders.
He's got a plant on Scalise.
- Let me go.
Look, Mark, I'm gonna give it to you
straight like a friend.
I don't like to see you made a monkey of
by a girl with a pretty face.
You got a record to protect.
You're as dumb as Thomas.
Come on.
I'll drive you home.
You're driving me nowhere,
you dumb lug.
You stick with your boss
and his orders.
You let me go,
or I'll paste you.
We're closed for the night.
- Scalise in here?
- I'll go and see.
Don't bother.
Get your clothes on,
Scalise.
When I'm ready,
Mr. Dixon.
Hey, cut that out.
Okay, Steve.
I warn you
not to touch me.
Why? You don't seem to be
carrying a knife at the moment.
We found the one
you used on Morrison.
- That's a lie.
- Is it?
It's always a pleasure...
to watch a cop four-flushing.
I don't like rats
to grin at me.
That's too bad.
Maybe I'd better show you
my hand, dream boy.
Tonight I'm not kidding,
Scalise. You're gonna talk.
We found out Morrison had you for about
20 grand and wanted to leave.
So you knifed him.
Then you got worried about Kenneth Paine
sobering up and telling about what happened...
so you sent one of your mugs
down to his place to knock him off.
You trying
to frame me for Paine?
You killed Morrison,
and you killed Paine...
and I'm going to get
a statement out of you.
Outside, you lugs.
He's gonna talk...
and talk to me alone.
Go on, I said, outside.
Okay, Steve.
Joe! Ernie!
- Better have a look out front, Kramer.
- Yeah.
Get your coats.
I oughta finish the job.
This guy's gonna keep after me.
Wouldn't be smart. They'd put
on too much heat for a dead cop.
- They still out there?
- They're still there.
- Both of them?
- Both of them.
- I can't make up my mind.
- Don't.
All right, have it your way.
Let's go.
Get the keys, Steve.
- Yes?
- Mark Dixon.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to you, Miss Taylor.
What's the matter?
You're hurt.
I could use a drink.
Where the devil am I?
I keep coming and going.
I don't know
why I came here.
I'll go now.
You can't leave like this.
Why did I come here?
I must have had
something on my mind.
What happened to you?
A run-in with
Scalise and his pals.
Shouldn't I call the police?
Let's leave the police
out of this.
I made a big idiot
out of myself tonight.
Bigger than usual.
Did I bungle this one.
I'll fix your head.
Come with me.
I suggest you use an ax.
Here.
Come and sit down.
What did they hit you with?
Various objects.
Why did you fight
with Scalise?
Did it have anything
to do with my dad?
In a way, yes.
You don't think
Dad did it?
You don't think
he's guilty, do you?
What I think doesn't matter
a row of nickels.
The most important thing
is that you need a lawyer.
That's what I came here for.
You need a big-time lawyer.
Here, hold this.
- One that can't lose.
- But if Dad's innocent-
That doesn't always help.
Innocent people can get
into terrible jams too.
One false move,
and you're in over your head.
How much money have you got-
you and your father- for a lawyer?
- None.
- No savings?
No.
Paine got 'em, huh?
Yes.
Thanks for the facial.
I feel a lot better now.
You go on back to bed.
I'll be back in the morning
about 8:30.
You wait here for me.
You're not fooling me.
You do believe Dad didn't kill him.
Your dad never touched him.
Good night.
Good night.
I'm sorry to wake you up, Paul.
I won't stay but a minute.
I need some dough.
Who stuck his finger
in your eye?
I've got 7 00 in the bank.
That leaves me 300 shy.
It's for a lawyer.
I thought you wouldn't mind
kicking in.
I wanna get Norman Ackerman
to handle the Taylor case.
He never lost
a murder verdict in his life.
But you gotta slap down
one grand, minimum.
Be right with you.
- Who is it, Paul?
- Mark.
- He wants 300 bucks.
- For what?
- For a lawyer for his girl.
- Since when does that gorilla-head got a g-
Shh!
Please, Shirley, don't argue.
After the way he treated you,
to have the nerve to come here and ask for-
I told you!
No arguments, please.
You told me you were
never gonna talk to him again.
I don't know, Shirley.
Sometimes, you really get me sore
with this kind of nagging.
Three hundred dollars...
for a man you were gonna punch in the jaw
the next time you saw him.
l-
Yeah.
Take them to the Acme Loan this time.
You'll get more.
Who knows?
I might even get to wear them someday.
- Yes?
- Detective Dixon is here with a young lady.
Have them come in.
Send off that cable, Mary.
I'll call you later.
Hello, Mark.
- Hello,Jerry.
- Well, what happened to you?
I'm just fine.
Oh, Mr. Morris, this is Miss Taylor.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss Taylor? Sit down.
- Thank you.
-Jerry, I understand Ackerman's out of town.
- When do you expect him back?
- He's in Washington.
He's due back
around 5:00 this afternoon.
I'd like to make an appointment
with him for Miss Taylor.
Her father's involved
in the Paine/Morrison case.
I read about it.
Thought you were on it, Mark.
I am.
That's why I'm here.
I like stiff competition.
Here's your retainer for Miss Taylor's father.
It's $1 ,000.
I'll hold it.
Come in around 5:30.
Mr. Ackerman will see you,
Miss Taylor.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I never heard of anything so generous-
what you just did.
Well, my partner
kicked in too.
You're an amazing man.
You know something?
I could kiss you right here.
I'll take a rain check
on that.
I'll give you
an alibi for your boss.
Tell him you're late because
the police questioned you.
Mr. Friedman has dispensed
of my services.
I'm the notorious
Miss Morgan Taylor.
Bad for buyers. Might take their minds
off Mr. Friedman's creations.
That mug!
I'll run him in.
I bet you would.
- All right. Good-bye.
There's a phone call for you, Mr. Detective.
Do you wanna answer it?
- No, I'm busy.
- That's what I thought.
I told him you weren't here.
It's wonderful the way
he looks at you.
He didn't even eat
his ravioli.
He just eats you up with his eyes
because you're so beautiful.
- Cut it out.
- What's the matter? I'm tryin' to help you.
You don't know how to make love,
so I'm makin' love for you.
- Bye-bye, Martha.
- Bye.
Bye.
It's a wonderful day.
No job, everybody against me...
my poor dad
sitting in a cell.
- And it's a wonderful day. Isn't that amazing?
- Hey, Mark?
- Excuse me a minute.
- Hello, Mike.
- There's a forthwith out for you.
Where you been hidin'?
- What's up?
- The skipper's chewin'
on the telephone. Come on.
Do you mind going up to see
Ackerman alone? It might be better at that.
Then wait for me at my hotel.
230-A East 54th.
I'll be there, Mark.
And thanks for everything.
Let's go.
You wanted to see me,
Inspector?
Come here, you.
Is this one of the men
who beat you up last night?
That was just
a personal affair, sir.
Your personal affairs seem to be getting
in the way of the department, Dixon.
Take this man out and hold him
as a material witness.
You had no business
going after Scalise.
You were asked not to.
You were told to lay off by your superior.
I thought I could get
a statement out of him.
Well, you didn't.
And now you've driven Scalise to cover
with your bullheaded tactics.
It'll take us days
to find him now.
- I'll find him.
- You'll ind nobody!
I'm not throwing you out of the department,
like I should...
but I'm inviting you to take
one week of your annual vacation...
beginning as of now.
I don't wanna see
or hear of you for a week.
- I want you to go someplace
and get hold of yourself.
- Yes, sir.
Look at you, all bunged up
like a barrelhouse vag.
First thing you better do is
get your head fixed up, inside and out.
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.
He's got a point.
You shouldn't have let Scalise go
until the Morrison job was cleaned up.
It looked certain
that Paine had done it, sir.
Get on this fella Steve.
I've got a hunch he'll sing
if you keep on him.
And try talking to him
like Dixon would.
Yes, sir.
Sit down.
You're going to talk.
You were in that crap game
with Morrison.
- Yeah, but I didn't see nothin'.
- Listen!
I want straight answers,
and I want them now.
Hello.
Did you see Ackerman?
Yes.
You've been crying.
What happened?
Mr. Ackerman doesn't
want to take the case.
He's too busy.
There are other lawyers.
I'll get in touch
with Bill Cadwell.
He's as good as Ackerman.
It won't help.
It's no different
than it was.
You felt all right
this afternoon.
I didn't realize
how serious it was.
But now, I know.
I thought because Dad was innocent,
nothing could happen to him.
- But it will.
- It won't.
It's already happened.
He's in jail.
They'll try him,
and he didn't do anything.
Somebody else did it,
and he's got to pay for it.
- He won't be tried.
- Don't try and fool me.
Ackerman didn't take the case,
because he was afraid of losing it.
That means they might
find him guilty.
I'm not fooling you.
Nothing is going to happen
to your father.
Why?
You didn't sound
so certain before.
Now you're certain.
- Because he didn't kill Paine.
- But can you prove it?
- Yes.
- How?
Mark, you know something
you haven't told me.
- That's right.
- What?
What is it?
I'll tell you.
Please.
Oh, that's not fair-
to stand there without telling me...
even if you have
to break some police rule.
If you know something,
Mark-
I can't stand thinking
how he feels.
He's never done anything wrong.
You don't know him.
He's sweet. He's always felt
that everybody was his friend.
Now he's in jail,
like a criminal.
You don't know what it is
to have your father in trouble.
My father was a thief.
What?
He's dead now. He died when I was 17,
trying to shoot his way out of jail.
I worked all my life to try
to be different from him.
Mark.
Darling.
- You'd better go home.
- Why, Mark?
Because you're a sucker
for wrong guys, like Ken and me.
You're not wrong.
I trust you
with my whole heart.
I'm glad you told me
about your father.
You're not like him.
I know it.
Thanks.
I figured out what to do...
about your dad.
What?
Don't ask any questions.
I've got to do things a certain way.
You look tired.
Get some sleep.
Thanks.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Everything's going to be
all right, isn't it?
Sure.
It'll turn out all right.
- So long.
- I'll wait here for you.
- Okay, Mac.
- You oughta be more delicate, Mr. Dixon.
I almost hit
my head on the door.
That's okay, Willie.
The cab's insured.
I wasn't doin' nothin', Mr. Dixon.
I was just standin' there readin' my paper.
I'm not interested
in what you were doing.
- You're up for parole violation Monday.
- I know.
- Three more years, isn't it?
- That's right.
- Would you like to duck that?
- You can't do nothin', Mr. Dixon.
I can say I sent you up to Scalise's hotel,
using you for a stoolie.
- Yeah?
- Particularly if you prove it.
- Like how?
- Don't play dumb!
You mean by squealin'
about the Morrison job?
No. By telling me
where Scalise is.
You're gonna tell me, Willie...
and save yourself three years
and a lot of trouble- bad trouble.
- Come on.
- What do you call this- good trouble?
- You're asking for it, and you're gonna get it.
- Wait, wait. Wait.
- They'll kill me, Mr. Dixon.
- Where's Scalise?
I gotta find out first.
Uh, a telephone. Let me get to a telephone.
- Okay. Hey, Mac, pull up at that bar.
- Okay.
- Keep the change, Mac.
- Thank you, Mr. Dixon.
Don't push me!
They'll catch on!
Get in that booth.
I won't listen.
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Willie Bender.
Who's this, Kramer?
Listen, Kramer, I'm hangin' here by a shoelace.
What do you mean,
what do I mean?
Dixon is on my neck.
Yeah, he's right outside the booth.
No, no, he can't hear nothin'.
He wants to see Scalise.
What's the idea
of calling here?
Ain't ya got any brains in your head, stupid?
That copper'll grab this number!
- Who is it?
- Willie Bender. Dixon has glommed on to him.
Give me that.
This is Scalise.
Is Dixon alone?
It's okay, Willie.
Now, get this straight.
I'd like to see Mr. Dixon,
but all by himself.
Now, here's the way
I want you to work it.
Get out a pencil
and write this down...
so if he's watchin' ya
he'll know it's on the square.
Hold it.
Just a second.
Okay.
Tell him I'll meet him
under the following conditions.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, I got it.
Yeah, yeah.
What did Scalise say?
Well, I wasn't conversin' with Scalise.
I was talkin' to Kramer.
He says he'll contact Scalise
in an hour...
and that you should be
on the East River Drive...
across the street from Bellevue
at 3:00 a.m.
And if everything's okay,
he'll pick ya up there.
Oh, and he says
you gotta come alone.
- What else?
- That's all.
- Thanks.
- Uh, what about my parole?
I done everything I could.
Hello, Blue Star Service?
Send a messenger to the Graystone Hotel.
He'll know where it is.
Have him wait in the lobby.
The name is Dixon-
Mark Dixon.
Right away.
Inspector Nicholas Foley. Dear sir...
I didn't have the guts to tell you this
while I was alive...
because I didn't want
to end up...
like Sandy Dixon's kid.
That's what every hood in New York
calls me-Sandy Dixon's kid-
and even in the department,
behind my back.
I wanted to end up as a cop...
and that's what I'm going to do.
I killed Kenneth Paine.
It was an accident.
I went in to pinch him.
He slugged me, and I hit back.
How was I to know he had
a silver plate in his head?
But I covered it up
like a mobster...
because I couldn't shake loose
from what I was.
Now I'm shaking loose.
I'm going to get Scalise
for you.
He's a hood,
like my old man was.
You won't have to worry about
pinning the Morrison killing on him.
You can pull him in...
for mine...
and that will square things
all around.
Sincerely, Mark Dixon.
Where's Scalise?
Scalise ain't here.
He left a message for you.
What is the message?
He's willing to see you
under certain conditions.
What conditions?
You gotta park your gun.
- Where is he?
- We got instructions.
It's " no go''
with a rod.
Put it down here.
Anything else?
We gotta frisk you.
Go ahead.
We're wasting time.
- He's clean.
- Come on.
- It's okay.
Sit down, Mr. Dixon.
I told the boys
you'd come alone.
That's because
I understand you, Mr. Dixon.
What I don't understand is your reason
for calling on me at this time.
I said sit down.
I never saw a man
as full of hate as you.
I consider it almost humorous,
the way you came hotfooting it after me alone.
I'm in the clear
on the Morrison job.
The police are satisfied
to let me alone.
But you're still hot on my neck
as always. Sit down, Dixon.
