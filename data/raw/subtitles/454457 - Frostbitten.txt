Hannes! Hannes!
Jochen! Come back! He's dead!
It's me... Jochen. Take my...
Aksel, faster!
We're going to die!
We're going to die!
Get a grip, Rauni! You're not going
to die! No one else is going to die!
You never give up, do you?
You always have to be the hero.
The fucking hero!
Karl, how are we doing?
I can't see them anymore.
I think they are regrouping.
This could be our chance.
It'll get dark any moment.
If we can get to the forest,
we can escape in the dark.
Always the optimist...
But we have no choice.
UKRAINE, 1944
The German Army Scandinavian Volunteer
Division: SS PanZer Division Wiking.
Separated from their unit.
Lost and freeZing.
The stove is still hot...
They must have fled
when they saw us coming...
Schröder,
clear the entrance of snow.
I thought we'd stand watch in twos,
but I think we all need some sleep.
- I can take the first shift on my own.
- Gerhard, what happened before...
Isn't it time you started
speaking German like everyone else?
Shut the fuck up!
Beckert?
- Beckert, are you awake?
- Elsie?
- I was thinking of something.
- What? What is it?
If the door and windows were jammed
with snow... How did they get out?
The people who live here...
How did they get out?
Rauni! If the door and windows
were jammed with snow -
- how did the people
who live here get out?
- Through the chimney?
- Wake up Aksel!
Aksel? Wake up! Aksel?
Jesus Christ!
What the bloody hell was that?
- I think I got it!
- Did you hit it or didn't you?
- I don't know. I think so.
- We'll just have to go and see.
No way I'm going in there again!
So what do we do? FreeZe to death?
I'll have a look. Cover me.
You're the hero, mate...
That thing had better be dead!
Are you OK?
Give me a light!
Karl, the lamp!
MARIA
I need help down here!
Get the spade!
Get the spade now!
We need something heavy!
FROSTBITE
Bloody morons!
Saga, when you get your license,
promise you won't drive like that.
I fell, and I can't get up...
But, honey, I told you
we would take that together.
I brought it up here, didn't I?
- What do you think?
- About what?
The apartment.
Everything will be fine, you'll see.
Once the furniture gets here.
Do we really need furniture?
We could just cover everything
in plastic and eat from the floor.
So this is the reason
we moved to this dump?
Yes, Gerhard Beckert. He is
a leading figure in genetic science.
He also happens to look like a moron.
Stop being so grumpy, please.
Well, I suppose maybe it won't
look as bad in the daytime.
I told you they have polar night
up here. No daylight for a month.
I'll go and get more stuff
from the car. You're coming?
I should've moved
in with dad instead...
Are you OK?
What?
I'm fine...
This isn't the first time.
Well, that's lucky.
Try and be more careful
next time, OK?
- Asshole!
- I heard that.
It's 6.30, amd here'sthe local mews.
Ayoumg mam wasfoumd dead.
Accordimg to the police...
It was all renovated in 1984.
The mental institution was
connected to the main building.
The old premises from the 50's
are more or less intact.
We can visit the electric shock
therapy room later.
After lunch maybe.
That corridor leads back to the foyer.
This way is the eye clinic.
We'll go this way
and come back here later.
And here we keep... Jesus Christ!
What the hell is going on here?!
Creative anatomy studies?
We don't want to see any of that!
Is that clear?
Throw syringes again, and I'll give
you creative anatomy studies, OK?
Start working on your haemophobia
instead, if you want to be a doctor!
- It won't happen again, sorry.
- Good.
Wheelchair racing. Anesthetic
in the cocktails at our office party.
I don't even want to imagine...
Those blasted budget cuts.
Doctors are either wet behind the ears,
or they've got one foot in the grave.
Never mind. This way...
- What's the bullseye?
- The spleen.
Gerhard... May I introduce
our new colleague: Annika Wallén.
It's a pleasure to meet you. You are
the main reason I applied for this job.
Oh, really?
I thought it was because of me.
So, you're interested
in genetic research, then?
I'm still somewhat
of an amateur in that area.
Good. I don't trust experts. Amateurs
are passionate about their work.
I'm busy right now, but we should meet
and talk some more on the subject.
I'm looking forward to that.
That's Gerhard's private patient.
His only patient, in fact.
Car accident.
She's been in a coma for over a year.
Déjà vu. I had the weirdest dream
last night. I was washing the dishes.
But everything was so brittle,
that it all just broke.
But I just went on until
the water was colored with blood.
- What do you think of that?
- Of what?
The dream... What does it mean?
- Do I know you?
- You have my old locker.
- Voila! You got a light?
- You can't smoke in here, can you?
No worries, I've got one.
- You just have to come to the party.
- Thanks, but I'm not invited.
I'm inviting you now.
There, you're invited. Officially.
Anyway, did you hear about
the guy who got killed?
No.
I know a guy at the hospital.
We can go look at the corpse.
No, I have class now... Besides,
it sounds like a horribly bad idea.
You don't have to answer now.
Give it some time, think about it.
Bring a camera,
so we can take photographs.
If you have to smoke,
you'll have to do it over there!
Yes, yes, yes. Rules, rules, rules.
Fascism, fascism, fascism.
I confess! It was me. Put me away.
I'm a danger to society!
I need a good talking to, and heavy
medication! You'd better handcuff me.
- Dress warmer and put that out.
- Do you think you'll catch him?
- Who?
- You know who. The killer.
No one has said anything about murder.
And you should show
more respect for the dead.
It's my parents.
It pains me to turn them in.
But justice must be served.
Lock them up and throw away the key.
Run along now, will you?
I'm sure you have a class now anyway.
- Yo, mama!
- WhaZZup, motherfucker?
- So what do you think about it?
- About what?
- Sander Carlsson is dead!
- You're bullshitting me!
- But we saw him yesterday!
- When did you see him?
The cops asked if I'd seen anything.
What was I supposed to say?
"I saw him driving
down a foot path at 100 kph".
- Haven't you been questioned?
- No. What happened to him?
They've been looking for you,
you just haven't heard anything.
Because of your humongous headphones.
They'll give you neck injuries.
- Can anyone tell me what happened?
- He crashed, I suppose...
- Wasn't that just a question of time?
- How are the party preparations going?
This will be the most awesome party!
People will talk about it for weeks.
Just make sure that some of the house
still stands when we get there.
- We're having dinner with my parents.
- Cornelia and her beloved Sebastian.
I invited this girl to the party.
You'll like her, such a nice girl!
When did you see Sander Carlsson?
12 HOURS EARLIER
Rick Allen isn't
the drummer of Iron Maiden!
- So who is?
- Nicko McBrain plays in Maiden.
- You just made that name up.
- You're thinking of Def Leppard.
- And the difference is?
- He's only got one arm!
How could anyone play
the drums with just one arm?
- Can you get something for the party?
- Sure. I've got contacts.
- Isn't he doing community service?
- It's ironic, isn't it?
He gets community service
for doing the community a service!
No worries, though,
I've got a new contact.
We can't have that! Overtake them!
Burn them off the road!
Wow! Déjà vu.
If the cops see us,
your license is history!
Wasn't that Sander?
Who else? Christ, the way he drives!
It's a wonder he's survived this long!
Well... To begin with, we have
a penetrating skull trauma.
But that's not what's bothering me.
Any idiot can pick up one of those.
- What's really interesting is this.
- What's that?
Dermatic perforations at a 35mm
distance of Arteria carotis communis.
Really? Could you run that by me
one more time, in normal language?
Two holes right into his main artery.
That alone would be the cause of death.
But how did he get them?
- So there is a crime involved?
- I don't know, I just got him in.
It could just be from his helmet strap.
But in my whole medical career,
I've never seen anything like it.
But you can stay for the autopsy.
I'll give you answers as they come up.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Why don't you call me
when you know?
I have a bit of a problem
with dissected people.
You do, do you? Well, I'll call you
as soon as I find out more.
- You have my number, right?
- Oh yes.
Hello, darling, it's me...
No, your husband!
I have to work late today.
This thing just came in...
Well, a corpse, obviously.
And yes, I know how
the microwave oven works.
And say hello to your choir leader.
Bye.
Gerhard! Good Lord!
You've worked with dead people
for too long.
Doctors don't have to work with living
human beings, if they don't want to.
How can I help you?
- I will take over this autopsy.
- Take over?
- Yes, if you don't mind.
- I was a bit surprised, that's all.
I thought maybe I should get
back to field work again.
And I overheard your conversation...
Lisbeth is going out tonight, and
she's put something in the fridge -
- for me to heat up.
But I've forgotten what it was.
And she said I absolutely shouldn't
take the... whatever it was.
The little problems of everyday life.
Hurry on home then!
Thanks. I owe you one.
Don't mention it.
That police officer, Jacob, was here.
He wanted to see the report.
I've got his number here somewhere.
- I'll take care of that.
- OK. Thanks again, Beckert.
May the Lord have mercy on your soul!
- Déjà vu.
- Do you always stand there?
- So, you thought about it?
- The corpse? No, thanks.
- No, the party. You're going?
- Who are you?
- Vega.
- Saga.
You're joking? Vega and Saga? That's
like Smith & Jones, or Bonnie & Clyde.
It must be an omen.
Something cosmic.
- Are you on medication?
- Not at the moment.
What about the party? It'll be fun.
You'll get a chance to meet people.
What kind of people?
Patients from your ward?
No, sound people
with healthy bodily fluids.
- I'll think about it.
- Good. Don't be scared of strangers.
Well, now you've detained me
long enough. Ta-ta!
Hello?
Damn!
- Weren't you supposed to make soup?
- There are no spoons.
They must be in one of these boxes,
somewhere. Have you seen the mixer?
- What?
- The mixer, the blue one.
- I don't think we have a blue mixer.
- Oh, come on. The blue mixer!
No, I haven't seen it.
Maybe it got lost?
What if someone took it?
One of the removal guys?
I'm sure it's at the bottom of a box
somewhere, along with the spoons.
There's a film on tonight.
French, I think. Want to watch?
Yes... No, I'm going out tonight.
Really? Well, I probably
don't have the time either.
- But you must have seen it?
- The film?
The mixer!
You made milk shakes with it.
I haven't made milk shakes
since junior high!
It's blue, anyway.
Do you know what I found?
The Soda Stream I got
when I was in junior high!
What's that?
I don't know.
I took it from professor Beckert.
Can I have a look at it?
- Oh... It's one of those!
- You know what it is?
I knew a guy who used to sell
these at parties. Great stuff.
- How do you mean?
- Great fun, will save any party.
Like ganja, but without the smoke.
You want to try it?
OK.
Give it here then.
- For fuck's sake! I was just kidding.
- It tastes like shit!
Are you out of your mind?
You can't just swallow any pills...
And you shouldn't trick
people like that.
Wait... Something's happening.
- What?
- My head's swimming.
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Fuck!
- You all right, Lukas?
- It's fun until someone gets hurt.
Have another pill, why don't you?
Saga? Could you come over
and help me, please?
- What is it?
- Are you going out?
Yes, I was invited to a party.
I told you.
Invited to a party already?
What's that, a personal record?
- What do you need my help for?
- This. It's not working.
Move that card there.
I'm amaZed I didn't see that.
Will you be out late?
I don't think so. You're working
the night shift anyway, aren't you?
The whole place seems to be
full of mental head cases.
- Isn't that a tautology?
- What?
No, forget it. It's great
you got to know people already!
Yes, a few. It's nice to have
friends who aren't removal men.
Removal men may be useful, but you
don't go and see a movie with them.
- Let's pick out clothes for you!
- I've chosen some already.
Don't be silly. Come on, let's go!
How are the larvae?
You are eatimg larvae.
How do they taste?
A big boy like you
have mothimg to worry about.
- Tell her I've gome out.
- Marit has beem dead for 20 years.
I'm aware ofthat.
I have a terrible headache.
Go get it!
I'm looking for a ball.
Have you seen my ball?
No.
Come on!
Come here, boy!
Talking dogs... There's not a bloody
thing written about talking dogs!
Hello?
Hello?
- Jesus Christ, you scared me!
- Sorry.
- What did you do? You're all...
- It's just a bit of... ketchup.
- Shouldn't you get ready?
- For what?
- For dinner with my parents.
- Oh, bloody hell!
I just wanted to make sure
you hadn't forgotten about it.
- No, don't worry.
- OK, see you at our place, then?
Yes, of course.
- Take a shower, for God's sake.
- Don't worry, Cornelia!
Where did Rufus go?
- Rufus!
- Hey! You! Mr. Smartypants!
- Look what I found!
- Rufus, don't touch it!
- Anything on the floor is mine!
- I need it, OK?
What are you screaming about?
What are you doing?
- Did he poo on the carpet?
- No, but he...
- Pull yourself together, Sebastian!
- But there's dog hair all over the...
Don't be late, please! My parents
like people who are on time.
Come on, Rufus!
- Get a grip!
- You're going to burn!
Burn!
OK then. See you later!
Hello? Mr. Dope Fiend?
Thank God! I was completely
sure I'd missed you!
- Were you able to get me anything?
- Get you what?
For the party.
I called a week ago.
Don't let me down now.
- I'm sorry, Vega, I forgot.
- You forgot? I gave you money!
I'll give it back to you tomorrow.
The party's tonight!
What the hell am I supposed to do?
- I can get you some laughing gas.
- I want to party, not give birth.
- And why are you still at home?
- I live here.
Weren't you going
to Cornelia's parents?
- Oh, shit! She's going to kill me!
- Serves you right.
I have to run.
I have to take a shower.
You'll get your money tomorrow.
I just don't have time right now.
I'm sorry, Vega.
- Professor Beckert?
- Someone's been in my private lab!
She bit me! Your patient,
the comatose woman.
- She bit me!
- May I see that?
Here. Press this against the wound.
Come on. Ring the door bell.
You're just a little late.
- You must be Sebastian. Welcome!
- Thank you.
Watch out, or Hampus
will jump out through the door.
- My name is Eva.
- Nice to meet you.
Why don't you hang your clothes over
there? Dinner will be ready soon.
What's wrong with you?
- What?
- What's wrong with you?
Get lost, monkey-boy!
Hi, honey. How are you doing?
I'm fine...
I have to... where's the bathroom?
- That door over there... Are you OK?
- I feel great.
Get focused.
Hello?
Hello?
- Aloha, baby!
- What do you think?
- Kinky.
- Could you sort anything out?
Yes, but I don't know if we should.
I feel a bit bad about it.
I nicked them from Sebastian.
- Fuck him, if he can't take a joke.
- Where is everybody?
They're on their way. Cornelia
and Sebastian will show up later.
People should start arriving soon.
And here they are!
- Hi there!
- Wait till you see what I've got.
I'll take whatever's behind
door number three!
That's awesome!
I want to try.
My precious!
Anyone there?
That wasn't funny!
Bad dog! Don't you see
you're scaring the girl?
Hello there. We haven't met.
Hi... Nice to...
...meet you.
- Are you all right?
Yeah, sure. My collar's too tight.
Can't really breathe.
I remember meeting Eva's parents for
the first time. Sweating like a pig.
Come on, let's go to the dining room.
- I can't. I can't take one.
- What do you mean you can't?
I've taken medicine for my asthma,
and I can't mix it with Ecstasy!
I can barely do alcohol as it is...
After all this hype
you're just going to "say no"?
And this isn't even Ecstasy!
We don't know what it is.
Are you sure
it's compatible with my medicine?
"Compatible with my asthma medicine!"
Give me a break! Here you go, Vega.
I'll see what happens to you first.
Then I might take one.
I don't want to end up in hospital.
What the fuck! Can someone please
do drugs properly here?
- Hello. I took one.
- Oh, shut up.
We raise our eyes to you in hope, and
you give us our food when it is due.
You open your hand and satisfy every
living creature with your kindness.
- Gloryfied be Thy name. Amen.
- Amen.
Dinner is served.
I hope you like
sea trout braised in garlic.
Looks delicious.
Come in!
- We haven't met, but...
- I know, you're Vega's mystery date!
Glad to see you here.
My name is John.
And I'm not really Vega's "date".
Not a sound, Annika...
- Dance?
- Maybe later, but probably never.
- Cool!
- You seem a bit off.
No, I'm fine. It's just that...
I have this weird feeling.
I have a feeling this
is going to be a great party!
Just chill out a bit.
How are we doing? Isn't it time
we let loose the mad dogs of hell?
- Vega, your date's here. Cute girl.
- I know.
- John, where can I smoke?
- Allow me to show you.
Come on, join the fun!
I'll go and get some more.
- Saga, darling! You came!
- But of course.
You'll have the time of your life!
Have you had some punch? Come on.
Is it too much to ask
what the hell is going on here?
Answer me, for fuck's sake!
You demented bastard!
- ApologiZe.
- I am sorry.
Say it with more feeling,
as if you really mean it.
I am really sorry.
- Where are the pills?
- What?
- Where are the pills?
- What pills?
You have no idea, do you?
You might feel a slight sting.
Who are you? Who the hell are you,
and what the hell is going on?
- Calm down, Annika.
- Explain!
You want me to explain.
Then I'll tell you.
On the Eastern front in 44,
we took refuge in a cabin.
But we couldn't hide
from what we found there.
Beckert... Grab her arms
and we'll drag her outside.
We'll get some firewood
and burn it to hell!
That was my last night
as a human being.
As a soldier I had to kill many times
before. But that night I killed -
- and drank blood for the first time.
And the only one who left the cabin
with me was of the same kind as I.
When the Third Reich fell,
and the German army surrendered -
- I headed back to Sweden,
with what I claimed to be my daughter.
We started a new life here.
You're joking, right?
You want me to believe
that you're a vampire?
- You can believe whatever you want.
- I think you're completely...
You're suffering from schiZophrenic...
My God!
- Don't move! I swear, I'II...
- Kill me? Can you do that?
Go ahead and try, Annika.
Stab me. Straight through my heart!
I'm on to you, John.
I know what you are. You're a lemon.
I always thought of myself as a mango.
OK, Freud, what do you mean?
People might be attracted to your nice
round shape, and bright yellow colour.
But they run away, when they realiZe
that you're bitter and sour inside.
You go well with drinks, though.
Sebastian? Are you all right?
- Sebastian?
- Yes, I'm coming. In a minute.
Sebastian, open this door!
I'm not feeling well, and I would
like to go home now, thank you.
Where's my rabbit?
Good work, Sebastian. I've always
hated that bloody rabbit!
- How did you get to know Vega?
- Everyone knows Vega.
She's a nice girl,
and not as mad as she seems.
She just wants
to make a cool impression.
That guy definitely
can't handle his drink!
Cornelia, darling! Where's Sebastian?
I am now going
to drink my brains out!
I don't fucking care where Sebastian is
or what the hell he's doing.
Come on, Ceasar, do your business.
Well, hello there!
I think it's only fair for you to know
I carry mace in my handbag.
Calm down, will you?
I'm not feeling well,
I have to go home.
- Drink some water.
- No, I'm serious.
I think it's those pills.
There's something weird about them.
What pills have you taken?
Something is very wrong!
He's just had a bit too much to drink.
Joel, I'll take you to the bathroom.
Come on.
- I've got to go to the bathroom.
- OK, I'll keep your seat.
I wish we had met under
different circumstances.
The comatose woman?
Is she one of you?
She's my guinea pig. I've tried
to find a treatment for this curse.
Being a vampire has many drawbacks.
But now I've changed my research.
Instead of trying to destroy my vampire
genes, I've started to improve them.
So you're trying to cross
humans with vampires?
You see. You really understand me.
My little blood supply. Thanks to her,
I have access to vampire blood.
And human blood is always obtainable.
You're using her!
I tried to cure her,
but she was too stubborn.
I'm the latest model.
She's stuck in the past.
I'm close to perfection. She's just
a stepping stone for the new species.
Just like you.
You're stuck in the past too.
You're her kind.
What do you mean by that?
Her kind?
Look at yourself! Feel it!
You must realiZe
what happened to you?
You overpowered me even though
you should be physically inferior!
It's busy, OK?
Come on!
My eyes hurt!
Please turn out the light.
OK, I'll turn it out.
But we can't stay in here for ever.
How do you feel?
Joel? I'm turning the light on.
Joel?
Joel!
Open the door! Open the door!
This is Cemtral.
Callimg Umit D2. Over.
D2 listening, on Main Street. Over.
Could you please
have a look atsomethimg? Over.
- Is it importamt? Over.
- It's very importamt, yes. Over.
OK, we're on our way. Over and out.
To think I moved here to wind down...
What happened?
- The blood isn't mine.
- So, whose is it?
A poodle's. You won't believe this.
A hysterical old lady is being
sedated in the staff room.
We have this guy in a cell
who's beyond description.
The old lady was holding a leash that
ended up in a pile of blood-soaked fur.
Next to her is this guy, apologiZing.
He's saying: "I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to!"
The old lady is devastated, demanding
we arrest him for killing her dog.
- Ceasar.
- Ceasar.
Seems like this guy did
horrible things to Ceasar.
- What do we have to do with this?
- You have to check this guy out.
- Sebastian.
- His name is Sebastian.
Hello?
Hello?
Give me the keys.
- To what?
- The cell. I'll check him out.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I think I have enough training
to deal with a lapdog killer.
Give me the keys.
If you're going in there,
you'll need some equipment.
- Ready?
- Ready.
What are you doing?
- Loading up with teargas.
- I can see that, but why?
- I might have to pull you out.
- You must be joking?
- You don't know what's in there.
- Yes I do: A pet killer.
What do you use against hardened
criminals? Anti-aircraft guns?
Let me in.
OK. Very funny.
Teenage werewolves, dead lapdogs...
Is this a typical Lapland joke?
Get on top of him! Use the shield!
Incoming!
My eyes!
- I'm sorry. I thought that...
- That shit really hurts!
You scared me!
- What are you doing?!
- One more step and I'll do it again!
- Why?
- You're a demon!
- No, I'm not.
- You have red eyes and fangs!
It's the latest fashion.
Stay away!
If I'd known you'd get that mad,
I wouldn't have done anything at all.
How are you doing?
You look a little pale.
Need anything?
A cup of blood, maybe?
Shut up!
You will feel the symptoms soon. Your
immune system won't know what hit it.
Surprisingly enough,
the virus is in fact a rhabdovirus.
Similar to rabies,
but a lot more aggressive.
Please, don't do this!
The virus is doing things to your DNA
that you could never imagine.
Just the discovery of its effects
on blood cells would give me -
- a Nobel PriZe in medicine!
But sod the Medicine PriZe!
When I'm done, our kind will rule over
all of you, like the cattle you are!
Don't worry, little one, it'll be OK.
Run!
I'm calling the police.
Hello, sorry for calling this late.
My name is Kajsa Falck.
Across the street there's
a bunch of drunken teenagers -
- making an awful racket
so I can't sleep.
They're even climbing the walls.
They are junkies and dealers all of
them, playing hip hop and hop hip -
- and I've had quite enough of it!
Number 3, Park Street.
Thank you very much, bye.
Awoman called complaining about
teenagers climbing the walls.
Do you remember any part of basic
training preparing you for this?
Kids crawling on the ceiling,
killing little dogs? No.
But maybe I just cut that class.
What's going on here then?
What seems to be the problem?
Who lives in this house?
Hey. You really have to...
Call for so much fucking backup!
- You've got the handcuff keys?
- No.
- I know what you are!
- You're holding them like an X.
Try something else.
Stop throwing gnomes at me!
What a totally uncool way to die...
Say something!
- Something...
- Are you OK?
Police! Stop or we'll open fire!
Get her out of here!
This just isn't happening.
Don't worry. It'll soon be over.
Dawn is just a month away.
What's your name?
My name is Saga. What's yours?
My name's Maria.
Mother says we'll be sisters -
- and we will always be together.
You'll never be alone.
Mother says you never
liked it here anyway...
