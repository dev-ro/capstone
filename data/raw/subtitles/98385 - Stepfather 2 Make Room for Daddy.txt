Excuse the mess here.
Dr. Winington has returned
to his private practice.
I'm Dr. Joseph Danvers.
Call me Joe.
I thought we'd start right in,
get some things out into the open,
and know what we're dealing with.
Want to tell me
something about yourself?
What's to tell?
Well...
it says here...
Jerry and Susan Blake...
were, according to neighbors
and friends...
the ideal, happy couple.
That is...
until Jerry brutally attacked
Susan and her daughter,
murdered James Ogilvie;
and just a year earlier...
Henry Morrison walked-out
on his family.
Jerry Blake, Henry Morrison,
and before them, Bill Krieger.
What kind of man changes names
like other people change their clothes,
and then marries into
fatherless families?
And how can such a man
be a loving father,
and devoted husband, right...
...up until the time he
decides, to calmly wipe that family
off the face of this planet,
hmm?
I believe, just a man.
A man with the same
dreams and desires
as me, or him.
A man who wanted all the things
everyone else does.
home and hearth...
but it got twisted...and turned
along the way.
What would you do
with a man like that?
I'd help him.
I'd reach out to him,
tell him to trust me.
I'd say to him that everyone is
entitled to their feelings.
Could he trust you?
Yes, Jerry,
just as much as I trust him.
Remove this man's handcuffs.
Doc, ain't no man sitting here,
it's a fuckin' animal!
Just do it.
It's okay, Jerry.
I don't smoke.
[SAW CUTTING WOOD]
[WHISTLING]
Where do your thoughts take you?
- Reti.
Who's Reti?
- My dog.

He was my best friend.
He was your best friend,
this Reti?
For a while.
What happened?
[SMALL CHOKE]
There was a...
...an accident, kinda.
Did Reti do something bad?
Did you punish Reti?
- [BEGINS TO QUIETLY SOB]
Jerry?
Jerry...
I thought we said we were
going to start trusting eachother.
I know.
You're the only one
I can trust.
Smith,
would you wait outside?
Maybe you being new, and all,
you're not up on the policy here, Doc.
I make policy, now, so...
...just leave, please.
Fuckin' shrinks!
So, where did your
thoughts take you, Joe?
It's beautifully crafted.
It's more than that.
It's much more.
What's that?
It answers your question of why
would a man murder one family and then...
marry into another, time and again.
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait!  Wait.
You see, Joe...
...the eternal optimist...
believes that you
can fix whatever's broken.
So...
...he just keeps on trying.
Wait outside, Smith.
That is good.
That is very good.
This will just take a minute.

[WOMAN TV REPORTER]:
Two men were brutally murdered
here this morning
when a patient here at
Puget Sound Psychiatric Hospital
staged an escape
in broad daylight that has
local police baffled.
According to hospital authorities
convicted family killer
Jerry Blake, also known as
Henry Morrison
and previously, Bill Krieger;
stabbed resident psychologist
Dr. Joseph Danvers
then bludgeoned
security guard Ralph Smith
before making his escape.
Unfortunately for Puget Sound
area residents,
local police have not
been able to recapture Blake,
nor do they have any clues
as to his whereabouts.
As of this moment, police are
combing the streets and highways
in search of Blake,
in one of the largest man-hunts
in Puget Sound history;
but so far, they
have made no progress.
...today on 'Dream House,'
our returning champions:
Suzie and Pete Morgan,
will make their second
attempt to win a dream house
and prizes worth over $100,000.
And now, here's the man
with the key to your dream house,
Mr. Bob Eubanks
[EUBANKS]:
This is round 1 of 'Dream House,' you know today
and everyday, our couples are competing for
a fabulous room of furniture and
a great dream house;
and Johnny Gilbert is about to
tell us about some of the houses offered
by our family of builders.
Here they are, John--
[JOHN]:
You could be moving to
Palm Meadow Estates
in lovely Loma Linda.
That's right.
Palm Meadow Estates, just
an hour's drive from downtown
Los Angeles
could be your home, sweet home.
Family values and easy living
will have you agreeing
that Palm Meadow Estates is where the
American dream becomes reality.
Tree-lined streets will welcome
you to these dens of domesticity,
where all areas of everyday life
have been planned,
down to the tiniest detail.
Schools, shopping centers,
and houses of worship
for almost every faith
make Palm Meadow the ideal family spot.
and it's all yours, Heinz family
free and clear,
for winning on 'Dream House.'
[APPLAUSE]
[WOMAN POLITELY COUGHS]
Excuse me,
Dr. Clifford.
Call me Gene, Miss Grayland.
[SMALL COUGH]
Well, actually, it's Mrs. Grayland.
Oh, well, isn't Mr. Grayland
the lucky one.
[SMALL LAUGH]
But  I suppose it's--it's Miss Grayland now;
I just got a divorce.
The logs.
They don't come out, look!
Oh?
-No, it's gas.
See, all you need to do is
turn this little valve.
Well, I'll be!
-Yes, it takes all the muss and fuss
out of making a fire.
Well,  I guess I'm kind
of old-fashioned, that way.
Nothing like stoking a fire
on a cold New England night.
Oh, really, where?
Well, my last practice
was in Connecticut.
Oh, that's a coincidence!
- Excuse me?
Well, the owners of this house, the Fieldings,
they just moved to Connecticut.
Perhaps you have a few tips
you could pass on to them?
Hm?
- Did they say how long
they were looking to lease for?
Yes, they did.
Two years, with an option to buy
at the end of the lease.
Mmm Hm!
Where's the basement?
- There is no basement.
I see.
Is that a problem?
Well, my last house had a basement workshop.
I like to work with my hands.
Well, I can understand that.
You know, a lot of people around here
use their garage.
Do you specialize in your practice, Gene?
Family.
Family guidance types of problems.
I find that everything in life
begins or ends with the family.
One way or another.
Seems like a nice neighborhood.
- Hm.
You couldn't ask for
a better neighborhood.
I should know,
I live right over there.
All by yourself?
Actually, I have a son.
[DOOR LATCHES]
[SKATEBOARD ON CERAMIC TILE FLOOR]
Oh, Todd, what did I tell you about
riding the skateboard
in the house?
I didn't know you were home.
-No, I didn't say that it was OK to do
when I'm not at home.
Park it mister.  Hm?
Where are you going?
To my room.
I was hoping that you and I could have
a little celebration. Hmm?
16" pizza with the works.
What are we celebrating?
Your mother sold 2 houses
and leased a third this week!
High 5 for mom!

That's great Mom.
-Hmm!
And then I went down to Dell Pharmacy,
and I bought-up every last
baseball card they had.
Got to be a Pedro Guerrero

Right?
The Dodgers traded Guerrero.
Oh....
[TV REPORTER]
...and in Washington State,
the manhunt continues.
Puget Sound Police
are still on the look-out
for escaped family-killer Jerry Blake.
Blake, who was serving time
for the grizzly murder of
a Seatle family
escaped from a psychiatric hospital
just a week ago.
So far, the police have found no clues.
Turning to weather:
Here in the Southern California area
we're still going to have
a 20-30% chance of showers
which will probably
give way to a warming trend
by the weekend.
The high tomorrow will be a
comfortable 67 degrees.

Quality time between a

Anyways, this last Sunday,
being Jake's birthday and all...
He wanted
something special with his present.
And what was that?
He wanted me to hum a song.
Well, as they say:
"music soothes the savage beast."
Not Jake.
It gets him all hot and bothered.
Especially show tunes.
Show tunes?
Yeah, this week I was supposed to learn 'Cats.'
I tried telling Jake that I
had been running around all week,
but with errands,
and planning the Church Social,
I didn't have time to learn the tunes.
Couldn't you just buy him the record?
It isn't the same, Dr Clifford.
I--I got to hum the songs.
Well, I--I can't blame a man
for taking pride in his wife's voice.
It isn't exactly my
voice Jake's so interested in.
What do you mean?
Jake likes me to hum when I...
You know...
[LAUGHS]
No, Sally, I'm afraid I don't.
He likes me to hummmm when I...
...when I kiss him down below.
[SNORT & SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER]
Well...

Do you know why
he makes you do that?
No, but if you hum a few bars,
I can fake it.

Hello.
Hiya, Matty.
-Hi.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
talking in my office?
To tell you the truth, Doc, no.
OK.
[SIGHS]
What's on your mind?
Not too popular, are you?
[NERVOUS CHUCKLE]
What's that supposed to mean?
Nobody likes to write to you.
You must have burned a lot of
bridges in Connecticut.
Have you been
checking my mail, Matty?
I mean, you did say
you were from Connecticut.
At least,
that's what you told Carol.
Then I saw this.
Why did you lie to her?
Did I?
I told Carol my last practice
was in Connecticut, yes.
This is from my high school,
telling me about my 25th class reunion.
Uh, it's amazing how they
can still find you
after all these years.
I'm very disappointed in you, Matty.
Nobody likes to be spied on.
I'm gonna have to go to the post office
and put a stop to this.
You were quite the basketball player
in 1964,
according to your class newsletter.
And this was in there
along with the invite.
"Harrison High School Cougars,
1964 Regional Division Champs."
They even got a picture of the team.
The funny thing is, I see your name here,
but I don't see you.
[SIGHS]
A man can change a lot in 25 years.
Not this much, Gene.
No.
No, not that much.
I knew you weren't a psychiatrist.
The question is now,
who the hell are you?
I'm just someone who loves Carol.
Let's see what she
has to say about this.
Matty, wait.
Wait,  please.
I never meant to hurt anybody,
least of all Carol.
I know that you're her friend
and she has a right to know,
but do let me tell her.
What are you gonna tell her?
More lies?
You have the evidence.
You can be sure I'll do it.
I just think that
she should hear it from me.
When?
Today.
Today.
You've got until five.

A lot more.

There's something

Shh.
There'll be plenty of time
for talk later.
Oh!
What happened?
One of my patients back in Connecticut...
heard voices.
And one of them told him
to do this to me.
This is what you were afraid
I'd find out?
I must look
like Frankenstein to you .
No.
Frankenstein was a monster.
You are...
...the kindest man...
...I've ever known.

I have the spare set of keys

A lot of good I did with them.

I'm gonna miss her

Sam, this is Gene,

- Hi, Sam.
Hello.
Matty must have been mighty upset
with that guy to do what she did.
What guy?
I don't know,
she had a lot of boyfriends,
but I never heard any of them
leave in the middle of the night before.
You heard someone leave her house
the night she died?
I heard someone walking
from her back yard
across mine,
someone whistling.
Whistling?
- Yeah.
Some song I ain't heard
in a long time.
[WHISTLES ♪'CAMPTOWN RACES' SLOWLY]
[INCREASING PACE OF ♪]
It was probably just some kid
taking a short cut through the old guy's yard.
What kid do you know
who whistles a song
like 'Camptown Races'?
How would I know?
Don't you see, Gene,
someone might have been here
the night that Matty died,
someone who knows
what really happened?
What do you think happened, sweetheart?
Alright, I know,
but I want to know why.
Carol, people die.
Life goes on .
We have a lot to do.
You have a wedding to plan.
Gene, I just don't know
if I'm up to that right now.
I just don't see why
we have to call off the wedding.
We're not calling it off.
We're just postponing it.
What about all the plans we made?
You know, you behave
as if nothing's happened.
My best friend just died, Gene,
and I--I just can't start worrying
about wedding arrangements.
So, instead of getting married,
you want to spend your time grieving?
Yes...  no!
I don't know.  Look, maybe if I'd been there
when Matty needed me, maybe none of--
"Maybe I could have
helped Matty."
Maybe Matty did need you.
You don't know that would have changed things.
What I know
is that I need you.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to push you, I ah--
I'm just afraid.
I'm afraid of losing you.  I--
