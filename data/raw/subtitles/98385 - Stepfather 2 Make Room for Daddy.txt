Honey, I'm home.
Hi, Honey, Good Day at the office?
-Ah, the usual.
Say, what's for dinner?
I made your favorite, pot roast and apple pie.
-Mmm, mmm, mmm!
Why can't you just leave me alone?
All we need is some order
around here!
Order!
[CRASHING]
We are going to keep this family together.
You had better believe it!
Wait a minute!
Why am I here?
[THUNDER CLAP]
Argh!
Thank you, honey!
[SHE CRIES OUT]

[CRASHING]
Stop it!
- Aaagh!
I love you!
[THUNDER CLAPS]
[INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER P.A.]
Time to see the new shrink,
bad daddy.
An hour with him,
then you're mine again.
In there.
Have a seat, won't you?
Excuse the mess here.
Dr. Winington has returned
to his private practice.
I'm Dr. Joseph Danvers.
Call me Joe.
I thought we'd start right in,
get some things out into the open,
and know what we're dealing with.
Want to tell me
something about yourself?
What's to tell?
Well...
it says here...
Jerry and Susan Blake...
were, according to neighbors
and friends...
the ideal, happy couple.
That is...
until Jerry brutally attacked
Susan and her daughter,
murdered James Ogilvie;
and just a year earlier...
Henry Morrison walked-out
on his family.
Jerry Blake, Henry Morrison,
and before them, Bill Krieger.
What kind of man changes names
like other people change their clothes,
and then marries into
fatherless families?
And how can such a man
be a loving father,
and devoted husband, right...
...up until the time he
decides, to calmly wipe that family
off the face of this planet,
hmm?
I believe, just a man.
A man with the same
dreams and desires
as me, or him.
A man who wanted all the things
everyone else does.
home and hearth...
but it got twisted...and turned
along the way.
What would you do
with a man like that?
I'd help him.
I'd reach out to him,
tell him to trust me.
I'd say to him that everyone is
entitled to their feelings.
Could he trust you?
Yes, Jerry,
just as much as I trust him.
Remove this man's handcuffs.
Doc, ain't no man sitting here,
it's a fuckin' animal!
Just do it.
It's okay, Jerry.
I don't smoke.
[SAW CUTTING WOOD]
[WHISTLING]
Where do your thoughts take you?
- Reti.
Who's Reti?
- My dog.
I got him when I was
9 years old.
He was my best friend.
He was your best friend,
this Reti?
For a while.
What happened?
[SMALL CHOKE]
There was a...
...an accident, kinda.
Did Reti do something bad?
Did you punish Reti?
- [BEGINS TO QUIETLY SOB]
Jerry?
Jerry...
I thought we said we were
going to start trusting eachother.
I know.
You're the only one
I can trust.
Smith,
would you wait outside?
Maybe you being new, and all,
you're not up on the policy here, Doc.
I make policy, now, so...
...just leave, please.
Fuckin' shrinks!
So, where did your
thoughts take you, Joe?
It's beautifully crafted.
It's more than that.
It's much more.
What's that?
It answers your question of why
would a man murder one family and then...
marry into another, time and again.
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait!  Wait.
You see, Joe...
...the eternal optimist...
believes that you
can fix whatever's broken.
So...
...he just keeps on trying.
Wait outside, Smith.
That is good.
That is very good.
This will just take a minute.
Argh!
[INTERMITTENT BUZZER]
Yeah, yeah.
What is it this time?
Doc?

[WOMAN TV REPORTER]:
Two men were brutally murdered
here this morning
when a patient here at
Puget Sound Psychiatric Hospital
staged an escape
in broad daylight that has
local police baffled.
According to hospital authorities
convicted family killer
Jerry Blake, also known as
Henry Morrison
and previously, Bill Krieger;
stabbed resident psychologist
Dr. Joseph Danvers
then bludgeoned
security guard Ralph Smith
before making his escape.
Unfortunately for Puget Sound
area residents,
local police have not
been able to recapture Blake,
nor do they have any clues
as to his whereabouts.
As of this moment, police are
combing the streets and highways
in search of Blake,
in one of the largest man-hunts
in Puget Sound history;
but so far, they
have made no progress.
...today on 'Dream House,'
our returning champions:
Suzie and Pete Morgan,
will make their second
attempt to win a dream house
and prizes worth over $100,000.
And now, here's the man
with the key to your dream house,
Mr. Bob Eubanks
[EUBANKS]:
This is round 1 of 'Dream House,' you know today
and everyday, our couples are competing for
a fabulous room of furniture and
a great dream house;
and Johnny Gilbert is about to
tell us about some of the houses offered
by our family of builders.
Here they are, John--
[JOHN]:
You could be moving to
Palm Meadow Estates
in lovely Loma Linda.
That's right.
Palm Meadow Estates, just
an hour's drive from downtown
Los Angeles
could be your home, sweet home.
Family values and easy living
will have you agreeing
that Palm Meadow Estates is where the
American dream becomes reality.
Tree-lined streets will welcome
you to these dens of domesticity,
where all areas of everyday life
have been planned,
down to the tiniest detail.
Schools, shopping centers,
and houses of worship
for almost every faith
make Palm Meadow the ideal family spot.
and it's all yours, Heinz family
free and clear,
for winning on 'Dream House.'
[APPLAUSE]
[WOMAN POLITELY COUGHS]
Excuse me,
Dr. Clifford.
Call me Gene, Miss Grayland.
[SMALL COUGH]
Well, actually, it's Mrs. Grayland.
Oh, well, isn't Mr. Grayland
the lucky one.
[SMALL LAUGH]
But  I suppose it's--it's Miss Grayland now;
I just got a divorce.
The logs.
They don't come out, look!
Oh?
-No, it's gas.
See, all you need to do is
turn this little valve.
Well, I'll be!
-Yes, it takes all the muss and fuss
out of making a fire.
Well,  I guess I'm kind
of old-fashioned, that way.
Nothing like stoking a fire
on a cold New England night.
Oh, really, where?
Well, my last practice
was in Connecticut.
Oh, that's a coincidence!
- Excuse me?
Well, the owners of this house, the Fieldings,
they just moved to Connecticut.
Perhaps you have a few tips
you could pass on to them?
Hm?
- Did they say how long
they were looking to lease for?
Yes, they did.
Two years, with an option to buy
at the end of the lease.
Mmm Hm!
Where's the basement?
- There is no basement.
I see.
Is that a problem?
Well, my last house had a basement workshop.
I like to work with my hands.
Well, I can understand that.
You know, a lot of people around here
use their garage.
Do you specialize in your practice, Gene?
Family.
Family guidance types of problems.
I find that everything in life
begins or ends with the family.
One way or another.
Seems like a nice neighborhood.
- Hm.
You couldn't ask for
a better neighborhood.
I should know,
I live right over there.
All by yourself?
Actually, I have a son.
[DOOR LATCHES]
[SKATEBOARD ON CERAMIC TILE FLOOR]
Oh, Todd, what did I tell you about
riding the skateboard
in the house?
I didn't know you were home.
-No, I didn't say that it was OK to do
when I'm not at home.
Park it mister.  Hm?
Where are you going?
To my room.
I was hoping that you and I could have
a little celebration. Hmm?
16" pizza with the works.
What are we celebrating?
Your mother sold 2 houses
and leased a third this week!
High 5 for mom!
[SLAP]
That's great Mom.
-Hmm!
And then I went down to Dell Pharmacy,
and I bought-up every last
baseball card they had.
Got to be a Pedro Guerrero
in there someplace.
Right?
The Dodgers traded Guerrero.
Oh....
[TV REPORTER]
...and in Washington State,
the manhunt continues.
Puget Sound Police
are still on the look-out
for escaped family-killer Jerry Blake.
Blake, who was serving time
for the grizzly murder of
a Seatle family
escaped from a psychiatric hospital
just a week ago.
So far, the police have found no clues.
Turning to weather:
Here in the Southern California area
we're still going to have
a 20-30% chance of showers
which will probably
give way to a warming trend
by the weekend.
The high tomorrow will be a
comfortable 67 degrees.
[WOMAN ON TV]
What do I look for
in a man?
Wua shh...
[SHE LAUGHS]
I look for...
a luxury automobile,
trust fund,
a platinum American Express card,
intelligence,
sense of humor,
a 4 carat rock.
[CLICKS TO NEXT]
I am...with this gentleman
that I have been seeing for a while,
and things are progressing in a nice
direction in the relationship,
and I'm about to explain that...
umm...I...use a diaphragm...and....
[CLICKS TO NEXT]
Of course, any man I date
has to understand that my career
comes first.
I mean, I haven't worked
all these years just to throw that away
on some guy.
[CLICKS TO NEXT]
[CLICKS]
On Sundays, we usually unplug the phone,
that way, Jake and me are left alone.
Quality time between a
husband and wife is very important, Sally.
Anyways, this last Sunday,
being Jake's birthday and all...
He wanted
something special with his present.
And what was that?
He wanted me to hum a song.
Well, as they say:
"music soothes the savage beast."
Not Jake.
It gets him all hot and bothered.
Especially show tunes.
Show tunes?
Yeah, this week I was supposed to learn 'Cats.'
I tried telling Jake that I
had been running around all week,
but with errands,
and planning the Church Social,
I didn't have time to learn the tunes.
Couldn't you just buy him the record?
It isn't the same, Dr Clifford.
I--I got to hum the songs.
Well, I--I can't blame a man
for taking pride in his wife's voice.
It isn't exactly my
voice Jake's so interested in.
What do you mean?
Jake likes me to hum when I...
You know...
[LAUGHS]
No, Sally, I'm afraid I don't.
He likes me to hummmm when I...
...when I kiss him down below.
[SNORT & SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER]
Well...
[SIGHS]
Do you know why
he makes you do that?
No, but if you hum a few bars,
I can fake it.
[CHORTLES]
Carol, you're very quiet.
This isn't--
well, it's all very new to me.
I'm not sure where to begin.
Well, begin at the beginning.
My husband...Philip...
he's a dentist, and--
-I thought you were divorced.
Ran away with his 22 year-old hygenist.
Well, should we talk about the
ones who stay; like your husband?
What about my husband?
-Well, he's a perv...
I should know,
I deliver his mail.
You know, he subscribes to every
stroke-book and porn mag under the sun.
Ladies, please.
I beg your pardon--
-It's true, I swear!
All of his magazines come
in plain brown paper wrappers.
Madaline, please--
- [SHE LAUGHS]
Matty...
...to my friends.
Carol, you were saying?
Phil left, um,
a little over a year ago.
I knew that it was coming.
So, I've--I've learned how to
roll with the punches since then.
But Todd?
That's my son...
...it's really hit him hard.
And, where do your thoughts take you?
Well, what d'ja think?
-Think of what?
You know! Dr. Gene.
It's just the first session, Matty.
Oh, come on Carol,
this is Matty you're talking to.
I saw you get the 'hands-on'
treatment from the doctor.
He likes you!
- Oh! You starting to imagine things again!
Well, personally,
I wouldn't blame you for
jumping his bones.
Wh--wh--Keep your voice down!
What's  the matter?
You afraid to start dating?
No!

[BOTH LAUGHING]
If you're not careful,
and you back-up over one of these,
you can say goodbye to your rear axle.
If it wasn't for frozen dinners,
I might never eat.
Do you want to know
the secret to cooking?
Yeah.
You find someone else to do it.
That was great!
Well, there's plenty of Moo shu pork left.
Thanks, I'm full.
Todd?
- Can I be excused?
Don't you want your fortune cookie?
- Nah, you can have it.
See 'ya, Slugger.
He's a nice boy!
Thank you.
[DOOR CLOSES IN BACKGROUND]
So, ah, when did you
decide to be a shrink?
Excuse me;
a psychiatrist?
When I was younger...
...I realized that the family...
...was the heartbeat
of this country, and that...
...sometimes when
families have problems they--
[THUD OF BALL AGAINST HOUSE]
...they need a helping hand...
[THUD]
[THUD]
Todd.
Excuse me!
â™ª [GUITAR]
I'm supposed to stop, right?
Your mother would appreciate it.
Here, let me show you something first.
When you side-arm the ball,
you never know where it's
going to end-up.
You throw over-hand,
it's like pitching on
a straight line.
Here, you try it.
That's it!
That's it, straight.
Just, give us a minute here.
You want to try this?
No, hit it like you mean it.
Todd, be careful!
Don't worry so much.
Boys will be boys.
I mean, I was.
You were?
Yeah, aha!
- Mm-mm!
Lean-in; put your hand
just behind his right shoulder.
Lean-in to him a little bit more.
1...2...3.
[TOGETHER]:  Cheese!
- Perfect.
[CAMERA CLICKS]
â™ª [MELODIC]
Home sweet home.
So, anyway, after I took
the Rorschachs
and the 'Wechsler Adult
Aperception Scale,'
I took this, ah,
'thematic intelligence' test.
It was pretty bleak.
I mean, bottom of the curve .
- You know?
- Aha.
Beyond the bottom of the curve.
[SHE LAUGHS]
And, I was really disappointed
because there aren't too many tests
like that that you can screw-up.
So--
- Well, maybe you'll do
better next time.
How?
What?
- How am I going to do better?
I mean it's not like I was taking
a math test or anything,
you know?
A person only has so much
'thematic intelligence,' right?
[SIGHS]
I mean, perhaps if you take it
in a better frame of mind.
Sure.
Doctor?
I'm sorry ladies,
we' re going to have to cut
this session short.
I'm feeling a little
'under the weather' today.
Sorry.
Hope you start feeling better.
- Thank you.
[BIRDS SINGING]
[CHATTERING]
Ah, Doc, can I
ask you something?
Of course, Matty.
Did you hear anything
that I said in there?
Don't you worry, it's all in here.
That's reassuring.
[DOOR BELL]
- Hi, Carol.
- Hello Gene.
How you doin'?
Fine, thank you.
I was just wondering if Todd wanted to
toss the old pigskin around
before dinner.
Well, he's not home right now,
tomorrow might be better.
Carol, where are you
keeping the coffee
these days?
I'm sorry,
you have company.
- No, no, ah--
- Doctor Gene Clifford, this is--
-  Phil.
Phil Grayland,
Carol's husband.
Oh, well.
Hi ya, Phil,
pleased to meet you.
I'll, ah, come see Todd tomorrow.
I'm sorry that he wasn't in.

He wants a second chance.

It's not just for him, though.
It's for Todd too.
And what do you want?
Uuuh...I don't know.
Perhaps you deserve better.
Perhaps.
It's just the great unknown
that I'm afraid of, I--
with Phil, I know what I'm getting.
How about if I try
to find out exactly what it is
you would be getting?
What do you mean?
Why don't you ask Phil
to stop by and have a chat
with me tonight?
Couldn't hurt.
Hi, kiddo.
Hey, do a jump for me.
I don't really feel like it.
It's OK.
I'll talk to you later.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Come on in, Phil.
- Hi Doc.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Well, I gotta tell ya,
Carol thinks you're some kind of
genius head-shrinker.
You don't sound convinced.
Dentists and psychiatrists....
I clean teeth,
you listen to sob stories;
it's not like we're
dealing with life and death.
If you don't have good teeth,
you can't eat, and you can't
deal with your problems--
Let's get something straight.
I'm only here for Carol's sake.
She wants you to check me out;
see if I'm for real this time.
Well, I am.
I made a mistake, alright?
I screwed-up royally.
Now that's over with,
I'm ready to come back.
Phil, when a tooth is dead,
you pull it out.
You don't just
hope it will get better.
What the hell
are you talking about?
Carol asked me
to say what she couldn't.
Oh yeah, what's that?
She wants no part of you.
I don't believe you.
It's true, Phil.
Thanks for the message, pal.
She's gonna have
to tell me to my face.
Phil, wait!
- Later!
- Phil, I made the whole thing up!
What?
[SIGHS]
It was a test...
...sort of.
[DOOR CLOSES]
It was a test 'sort of'?
Man, are you for real?
I'm sorry,
I had to be sure of you
for Carol's sake.

I guess the rug

Yeah.
So, does this mean
Carol is interested?
Oh yes, definitely.

I said he was cute.
Now, I'm saying he's weird.
Want a refill on that?
Ah, sure.
My parents got me a case

I think it's great.
Why do you think he's weird?
Oh, I don't know,

He didn't even say goodbye.
It's hard to say goodbye.
I know.
I know.
Carol, I have a confession to make.
I lied to you.
I don't understand.
When I said that I
was sorry about Phil,
- I'm not.
- What is this?
The pity treatment?
No....
No, no!

So, come on and

Come, help us celebrate!
Carol, what exactly
do you know about Gene?
That I love him.
Are his parents coming in?
They're both deceased.
What about his other relatives,
and...friends, and...?
No.
Well, you know that figures,
because the only things he gets
are local bills and junk mail.
You've been going
through his mail?
Carol, I don't think
you know him well enough
to marry him.
Oh, come on, Matty!
You don't even know

Matty, it's crazy.
Who do you think you are?
- I'm your friend.
If you are my friend,
you'll respect my feelings,

Why not?
Carol, this is my first marriage.
I just want to do everything right.
Big wedding,
Followed by that special night.
That's a bit Victorian, Gene,
don't you think?
Well, what's the matter with
sticking with tradition?
Nothing.
- I mean, if more people stuck
with tradition,
there'd probably be a lot
happier people
and a lot fewer divorces.
Maybe you think I shouldn't wear
a white gown, either.
No, no, no.
That's not what I was saying.
Gene, you know,
I think I better go home.

Hello.
Hiya, Matty.
-Hi.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
talking in my office?
To tell you the truth, Doc, no.
OK.
[SIGHS]
What's on your mind?
Not too popular, are you?
[NERVOUS CHUCKLE]
What's that supposed to mean?
Nobody likes to write to you.
You must have burned a lot of
bridges in Connecticut.
Have you been
checking my mail, Matty?
I mean, you did say
you were from Connecticut.
At least,
that's what you told Carol.
Then I saw this.
Why did you lie to her?
Did I?
I told Carol my last practice
was in Connecticut, yes.
This is from my high school,
telling me about my 25th class reunion.
Uh, it's amazing how they
can still find you
after all these years.
I'm very disappointed in you, Matty.
Nobody likes to be spied on.
I'm gonna have to go to the post office
and put a stop to this.
You were quite the basketball player
in 1964,
according to your class newsletter.
And this was in there
along with the invite.
"Harrison High School Cougars,
1964 Regional Division Champs."
They even got a picture of the team.
The funny thing is, I see your name here,
but I don't see you.
[SIGHS]
A man can change a lot in 25 years.
Not this much, Gene.
No.
No, not that much.
I knew you weren't a psychiatrist.
The question is now,
who the hell are you?
I'm just someone who loves Carol.
Let's see what she
has to say about this.
Matty, wait.
Wait,  please.
I never meant to hurt anybody,
least of all Carol.
I know that you're her friend
and she has a right to know,
but do let me tell her.
What are you gonna tell her?
More lies?
You have the evidence.
You can be sure I'll do it.
I just think that
she should hear it from me.
When?
Today.
Today.
You've got until five.
[CAROL GASPS, PAUSES, THEN EXHALES]
Can you forgive
a lifelong bachelor's premarital jitters?
Oh, Gene.
They're so beautiful.
They're ah--
the first part of
a very involved apology.
There's more?
A lot more.
[GENE CHUCKLES]
[CAROL SIGHS]
[CAROL SIGHS]
[CAROL WHISPERS]:
What's wrong?
There's something
that you should know about my past.
Shh.
There'll be plenty of time
for talk later.
Oh!
What happened?
One of my patients back in Connecticut...
heard voices.
And one of them told him
to do this to me.
This is what you were afraid
I'd find out?
I must look
like Frankenstein to you .
No.
Frankenstein was a monster.
You are...
...the kindest man...
...I've ever known.

Hello.
Hi.
What?!
[VICAR]:  lf we'd only known
as I'm sure the Lord knew,
the pain her soul was suffering--
Why?
Why did Matty kill herself?
It doesn't make any sense.
Matty was afraid.
She was afraid
of being left alone.
She looked everywhere
for her er...
...Mr. Right.
She just couldn't find him.
[QUIETLY SOBBING]
Oh, Matty!
[TAPPING ON GLASS]
[TAPPING CONTINUES]
Gene?
[TAPPING CONTINUES]
Gene?
It's Sam.
I was just going to come over.
Oh, I heard your car pull up.
There's a box right over here.
Sit down.
- Thanks Carol.
I have the spare set of keys
she left with me...
...in case there was
an emergency or something.
A lot of good I did with them.
- Sam, don't talk that way.
I'm gonna miss her
- We all are.
Oh, excuse me.
Sam, this is Gene,
my fiancÃ©
- Hi, Sam.
Hello.
Matty must have been mighty upset
with that guy to do what she did.
What guy?
I don't know,
she had a lot of boyfriends,
but I never heard any of them
leave in the middle of the night before.
You heard someone leave her house
the night she died?
I heard someone walking
from her back yard
across mine,
someone whistling.
Whistling?
- Yeah.
Some song I ain't heard
in a long time.
[WHISTLES â™ª'CAMPTOWN RACES' SLOWLY]
[INCREASING PACE OF â™ª]
It was probably just some kid
taking a short cut through the old guy's yard.
What kid do you know
who whistles a song
like 'Camptown Races'?
How would I know?
Don't you see, Gene,
someone might have been here
the night that Matty died,
someone who knows
what really happened?
What do you think happened, sweetheart?
Alright, I know,
but I want to know why.
Carol, people die.
Life goes on .
We have a lot to do.
You have a wedding to plan.
Gene, I just don't know
if I'm up to that right now.
I just don't see why
we have to call off the wedding.
We're not calling it off.
We're just postponing it.
What about all the plans we made?
You know, you behave
as if nothing's happened.
My best friend just died, Gene,
and I--I just can't start worrying
about wedding arrangements.
So, instead of getting married,
you want to spend your time grieving?
Yes...  no!
I don't know.  Look, maybe if I'd been there
when Matty needed me, maybe none of--
"Maybe I could have
helped Matty."
Maybe Matty did need you.
You don't know that would have changed things.
What I know
is that I need you.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to push you, I ah--
I'm just afraid.
I'm afraid of losing you.  I--
[SIGHS]
We don't have to have a big church deal.
The wedding's not important.
[WHISPERS]:  It's not?
- No.
The marriage is.
Having a family that cares about one another,
that's what matters.
We could just go to
a Justice of the Peace.
I love you.
I love you too, Gene.
We'll do it like we planned,
with flowers,
church,
the whole nine yards.

Hi.
Mom, you look really cool.
Thank you.
You like it?
Yeah.
Honey, have you seen my veil?
Ah, no.
Oh, this came for you.
Oh!
It's from Matty's mother and father.
Oh, they sent her
a case of this for her birthday.
Ah, thank you!
Now, what happened
to your tie?
I've never worn one of these things before.
I just can't get it.
Why don't you go across the hall
and have Gene look at it, OK?
OK.
What's it doing
down here, slugger?
Boop! [LAUGHS]
You still got the ring?
- Right here.
You know, if the best man loses the ring,
there can't be a wedding,
so I'm depending on you.
- Hey, no prob.
OK.
- OK.

Come in here.
Where did you learn that?
[TODD]: Why?
[CAROL]: What song were you whistling?
[TODD]:  I don't know I can't remember
[CAROL]: Try to remember
Gene taught me.
Why?
Wait outside.
You're gonna be late for your own wedding,
if you don't hurry up.
Gene, there's something that
I have to ask you.
Go ahead, sweetheart.
- The first night that we were together.
You came back with
a bottle of wine like this.
Where did you get it?
I don't remember.
Why?
This is the same wine
that Matty had.
So what?
What's this all about?
- Answer the question, where did you get it?
What's the difference?
The difference is
that you taught my son
the same fucking song
that Sam heard
the night that Matty died.
That's the difference!
Now answer the question!
Where did you get the wine?
[GENE GROWLS]
What do I have to do?
Why is this so hard?
Haven't I said
that I love you?
Haven't I been like a father
to that boy?
I even had sex with you,
for God's sake!
You will never...
[BOTTLE BANGS / GLASS BREAKS, FALLS]

than me, pumpkin.
