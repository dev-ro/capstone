In the 11th century and all throughout the Middle Ages
the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela,
or St. James of Compostela
was the site of a great pilgrimage –
one that is still being made.
Every year more than 500,000 pilgrims would set out on foot,
from all the countries of Europe.
Bound for Spain, to visit the tomb of the Apostle James.
In the late 16th century,
because the Wars of Religion disrupted the pilgrimages,
the Bishop of Santiago had the apostle’s remains hidden.
In the 19th century they were discovered by accident.
It was some time before the Papacy would recognize
that they were authentic.
In the 7th century A.D. according to legend,
a star guided some shepherds to where St. James' body was hidden,
hence the name Compostela;
from Campus Stelle - the Field of the Star.
In most Western European languages,
the Milky Way is also known as
'The road to St. James'.
You think these bastards will ever stop?
Forget it. Come on.
-I’m beat.
-And I’m hungry.
-Got any bread left?
-You know I don’t.
Alms, please.
Alms, sir.
Do you have money?
No, sir.
Then you shall have nothing. Nothing at all.
Yes, I have a little.
Then you shall have much more. Here.
-Are you going on a pilgrimage?
-Yes, sir.
To Spain?
To Santiago de Compostela?
Yes. How did you know?
Go, and find a harlot,
and have children by her,
name the first:
'You Are Not My People'
And the second: 'No More Mercy'.
Did you get that?
Look!
Where’d he come from?
Must have been under his cloak.
How did he know where we were going?
Who cares? He gave you money.
I should have told him I had money too.
But why’d he give it to me and not you?
I bet it’s your beard.
Beards inspire confidence. That’s good.
I guess so.
Reminds me of what me mother used to tell me as a kid.
You’re all dirty.
Go outside and play with your brothers.
Don’t shave, my son.
You look much better with your beard.
Your mother sure knew what she was talking about!
Wanna sell me a cigarette? I’m out.
Go ahead, take one.
Don’t forget we got that money. It’s for both of us.
I owe you one.
What are you doing there?
What happened to you?
You got blood on your hands.
Look at this.
And this.
What’s your name?
You all alone?
Where are your parents?
What, cat got your tongue?
Here, have some red wine. It’s good for you.
Hey, let’s go.
You should hurry home.
Want us to take you back to the village?
There’s no point.
Forget it. They won’t stop.
Well, get in! What are you waiting for?
Going far?
To Spain, sir.
You’re in luck. I’m going all the way to the border.
-You don’t mind if we drive all night, do you?
-Not at all!
I feel like Sleeping Beauty.
Feels so good.
goddam, goddam, goddam.
-Do you want some?
-No, thanks, quite honestly.
And you’re from around here?
Yes... nearby.
-I’d be glad to give you a lift.
-No thanks, I like walking.
Anyway, getting back to our discussion;
about the miracles of Christ,
there is absolutely nothing miraculous,
they’re commonplace occurrences.
-Really?
-These days, science can explain anything.
Miracles are natural phenomena, like it or not.
Well, I find that more than ever before science agrees with the Scriptures.
That’s why the whole world is now catholic.
What do you mean Catholic?
That’s right, the whole world.
But what about the Moslems?
Come now, the Moslems are Catholic.
and the Jews?
Especially the Jews.
What is it? What do you want?
Something to eat? Some leftovers? We have money.
Ok, Wait.
Hello folks.
You could let them in. It’s pretty cold outside.
-I thought they might bother you.
-Of course not!
Ok, come on in.
Sit down.
In any case, Father,
you’ll never convince me that the body of Christ can be contained in a piece of bread.
Be careful about what you’re saying.
The body of Christ is not contained in the bread.
In the sacrament of communion, the host becomes...
the body of Christ. No matter what we say, transubstantiation does exist.
I’d like to believe you.
I’ll admit I just don’t understand.
It’s beyond me.
The host is the body of Christ.
That is it!
Don’t Believe it’s a mere representation, a symbol, as it were, of the body of our Lord.
The Albigensians believed that.
And, of course, so did the Calvinists, among others.
And that is a serious mistake!
I always say that the body of Christ in the host,
is just like the rabbit in this pâté.
What?
I mean that it’s rabbit, and at the same time it’s pâté.
You don’t understand!
You speak like those 16th century heretics...
that were called, as a matter of fact, pate-liers! so don’t talk like that!
You must take the words of Christ literally!
Sorry, but it just doesn’t make any sense to me.
All the more reason to believe!
Religion without mystery is no religion at all!
In other words,
any heresy that attacks a mystery...
can easily seduce ignorant and superficial people,
but heresies will never be able to hide the truth.
Father, I’d like to ask you...
What happens to the body of Christ inside your stomach?
And what do you want?
Do you have any ID?
Dupont.
Duval.
Ok. Beat it!
Out!
Goodnight gentlemen.
Poor souls.
They didn’t even get a piece of bread.
A little charity, sergeant?
You can’t enforce the law, and also be charitable.
-How strange.
-What’s that?
It suddenly occurred to me the Pateliers were right.
It’s a revelation!
I feel that the body of Christ is in the host...
like rabbit in that pate! I’m absolutely sure of it!
-But you just said the opposite.
-I said the opposite? Who me?
So, Father, out for a little walk again?
Now you promised you’d behave yourself...
-We’re going to have to lock you up.
-Oh, yes, I’m sorry. I felt like getting some fresh air.
No, don’t bother. I’m fine now.
-You know me.
-We sure do.
Well, if you insist.
I never knew. He seemed so normal.
Who is he? Is he really a priest?
He was the parish priest of Chevilly till last year...
You probably contradicted him, right?
-Maybe.
-I knew it.
Touch my hand.
You have cold hands, but a warm heart.
A warm heart....!
How old are you?
and... you can still do it?
At my age...
Anyway the first thing I do when I get to Santiago...
You hear that?
Sounds like people talking.
You think so?
Can’t you understand?
It has already begun!
What’s he saying?
I have no idea.
Who are you? Where do you come from?
Whoever you are, welcome!
Come, if you wish.
but not a word about what you will see.
Who was that guy?
I don’t know.
A shepherd that talks like a priest.
Goodnight.
Brethren...
Good tidings from Rome thanks to proconsul Volventius.
The Emperor Gratian...
has reinstated Priscillian as the bishop of Avila.
Thus we are justified.
The heretic is not I...
but he who sits on the throne of Peter...
and who has taken the title of Pope.
Our doctrine is the right one,
and soon we will proclaim it publicly to all.
Let us give thanks unto God.
Our soul of divine essence.
Like the angels,
it was created by god
and it is ruled by the stars.
In punishment for a sin it was united with a body.
This body is the work of the devil.
The devil exists from the beginning...
like god himself.
A thing so unworthy and impure...
as our body...
couldn’t have been created by god!
The body is the prison of the soul.
The soul, to free itself...
must gradually become separate.
The body must be humiliated and detested...
and constantly subjected to the pleasure of the flesh...
so that the purified soul may return after death...
to its celestial abode.
Swear never to betray this secret!
We swear it!
It is not I who have harvested thee.
It is not I who have kneaded thee.
It is not I who have put thee in the oven.
I am innocent of all your sufferings.
And may all those who have caused them know the same agony.
It’s pouring!
What’s the matter? Scared?
I don’t like storms.
That sure ain’t going to protect you.
How do you know?
You believe in God?
What do you think?
Wait. Watch this.
Where are you going?
Can you hear me up there?
If you exist, go ahead!
You idiot! You’re really asking for it!
One... two...
Three!
See that?
Well, it didn’t hit me.
Idiot, you think God’s at your beck and call?
As I was saying, monsieur Richard...
at any rate, everyone should believe in god?
Yes. Of course, there have always been atheists.
But those people are crazy. Or they’re not real atheists.
How so?
Because a reasonable man cannot deny in his heart that god exists.
-But why not?
-Why not?
Because it says so in the Bible! Psalm 13.1.
the fool hath said in his heart: there is no God.
Well that settles it.
There is no God.
All religions are based on a false premise, Thérèse.
They all believe in god the Creator,
but this creator does not exist.
Is there any one religion that does not bear the emblem...
Of fraud and stupidity?
But one that especially deserves
our contempt and our hatred
is the barbarous law of Christianity,
Our birthright!
You rely on a vengeful God.
Don’t be foolish, Thérèse,
this god of yours is but a chimera,
that is found only in the minds of madmen.
It’s a phantom invented by wicked men,
Whose only purpose is to deceive them,
or to arm them against one another.
If this lord really existed,
with all the flaws that have appeared in his work,
how could we see him as anything but contemptible?
and heinous?
If there were a god, there would be less evil on earth.
Look, your ear is still bleeding.
It’s not a crime to depict the bizarre habits...
that nature inspires within us.
No, Thérèse, there is no God.
Nature is enough.
This godlike phantom, born out of ignorance and fear,
is nothing more than a revolting platitude,
which is not even worth a fraction of our time.
It is a pitiful extravagance
that disgusts the spirit, sickens the heart,
and that should forever return to the darkness from whence it came!
If your god does exist, I hate him!
Yes, God exists! God exists!
Only depraved people deny God!
And it’s only so they can give in to their passions,
because no one can deny the obvious.
Monsieur Richard, one thing I have trouble understanding,
is how Christ could be a man and a god at the same time.
Yes, Martha, it is difficult.
Look,
when the devil takes the form of a wolf, for instance,
well, he’s a wolf...
and he’s still the devil.
It’s almost the same with Christ.
...Would you mind helping in the cloakroom? you know what time it is?
-Right away, sir.
But if Jesus was god, how could He be born and die?
A very good question.
If Jesus was God, how could He be born and die?
If you only knew how many heretics talked about that!
Some said that Christ was only God.
That his human form was a fantasy, an illusion.
-So he didn’t eat?
-They said he didn’t - He pretended to,
and of course, he didn’t suffer, he didn’t die, ect.
That was the opinion of Marcion and the Monophysites.
And Nestorious, too?
That’s right, and they even said that Christ...
witnessed his own crucifixion.
Simon having assumed His appearance.
The other heretics said the opposite...
that Christ obviously wasn’t god, but a man. Just a man.
Get rid of this pear. It’s over-ripe.
But he could laugh, couldn’t he? And cough?
They always show him to be so dignified and solemn...
walking slowly, with his hands like that.
After all, he must have walked like everyone else.
We’re late
What time is it?
Almost the sixth hour.
I’m hungry.
-Master!
-What?
The guests have all arrived. Your mother and brethren also.
Behold my mother and my brethren!
For whoever shall follow the will of my Father, in heaven,
he is my brother, my sister, and my mother!
If He was a man, He must have been like any other man?
At first,
I didn’t dare believe it,
but then I was very happy.
Look how marvellous he is.
Master, they are all awaiting your words.
Just a moment! Just a moment!
There was a rich man
who had a steward, and...
the same was accused by him that he had wasted his goods,
and he called him and said, “why do I hear this of thee?”
“account for the stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer my steward.”
Then the steward said within himself,
“what shall I do? For my master taketh away from me my stewardship.”
“to dig I have no strength,”
“to beg I am ashamed.”
“I know what to do,
that when I am put out of the stewardship
they will receive me in their houses”
So then?
Just a minute.
So he called every one of his master’s debtors unto him,
and said unto the first, “How much owest thou to my master?”
“One hundred measures of oil,” he answered.
And he said unto him,
“take thy bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.”
Then he said to another, “And what owest thou?”
“one hundred measures of wheat” he answered.
The steward told him, “Write down eighty.”
And the master praised his unjust steward
because he had done wisely,
For the children of this world, are in their generation wiser
than the children of light.
They have no more wine.
Woman, what concern is that to you and me?
My hour has not yet come!
Do whatever he tells you,
Fill all these vases with water, and serve them.
They shall have wine.
So He was just like any other man!
In the 4th century, after the Council of Nicaea,
many Christians fought and even died to find out
whether Christ was like Father, or consubstantial.
This way, please.
What were you discussing, if you don’t mind me asking?
Nothing, really. This and that.
But what?
We were discussing Christ. His dual nature.
You’ve studied for the priesthood?
No, but the subject does interest me.
And we were also wondering why, of all the healers and prophets of that time,
such as Simon the Magician, for instance,
Christ was the only one who succeeded in the end.
Why because he was God!
Of course, Madame Garnier.
Some oysters to begin? They’re fresh.
Oysters, why not?
Please excuse me.
What do you want? Who let you in?
Sir, it’s only to ask you if you could spare a little,
We just wanted to know if...
-Alright, get out! Now! Go!
Let’s give it a try.
Excuse me folks,
this is my friend Jean, and I’m Pierre.
You wouldn’t happen to have anything...?
Pass me the rest of the chicken.
Thanks folks.
I hope you don’t have far to go.
-To Spain, ma’am.
-On foot?
Sometimes, and sometimes on the other.
Well then, why don’t you have a little wine?
Can’t say no.
It’ll put some hair on your chest. Have some.
To your health!
My dear friends...
Now. I am pleased to present to you,
our little annual performance.
And I ask your kind indulgence,
because as you all know,
this has been a difficult year.
These are violent times,
and fortunately, God has been watching over us,
and our classes haven’t been disturbed.
In a few moments,
the older girls will present a witty comedy
written especially for us
by Monsieur Pontier, our young pharmacist.
Before that, you’ll hear our ninth and tenth graders
recite the works of our great poets,
Racine, Lamartine and Henri de Regnier.
But first,
to show that in the young hearts we are teaching
that religion is a living reality
our little girls will deliver a brief prologue.
If anyone says it is permitted for a Christian
to have several wives,
and having several wives is not forbidden by divine law
Let him be condemned!
If anyone says that the sacrifice of the Mass
is a blasphemy against the sacrifice of Jesus Christ
who died on the cross
Let him be condemned!
If anyone says that God’s commandments are impossible to keep,
even for one who is justified and in a state of grace
Let him be condemned!
Let him be condemned!
What was that?
Is there a shooting range around here?
No, that was me.
I was imagining they were shooting a pope.
You’ll see a lot of things...
but never the pope being shot.
If anyone says that god hates the newborn babe,
and that He punishes him for the sins of Adam...
Let him be condemned!
Let him be condemned!
Many Christians wonder...
why God allows innocent animals to suffer.
Many also wonder...
why God did not make man herbivorous,
like the sheep
and the giraffe.
Now, little Sylvie,
our honour student,
will give you the answer.
If anyone abstains from the meats God gives us for food...
not because he wants to practice mortifications...
but because he feels they are not fit to eat...
Let him be condemned!
Let him be condemned!
And where was that said, Sylvie?
At the Council of Nicaea in...
At the Council of Braga, in 567, Canon thirteen!
And I say and I maintain...
that they Holy Scriptures never spoke of Purgatory!
And the so-called Confirmation and Extreme Unction...
were not instituted by Christ!
You are condemned!
You shall die,
for you have relapsed, succumbed to your errors.
But you still have a chance to escape the agony of hell.
Just say, I recant,
and your soul will be saved!
I cannot!
I wish I could, but I can’t!
Take him away!
What is it, my son?
Something is troubling me.
I am listening.
I wonder...
if burning heretics is not against the will of the Holy Ghost.
It is the justice of men which punishes them!
The secular arm!
Heretics are not punished for being heretics,
but because of seditious and murderous acts against law and order!
But then, those whose brothers have been burned...
will burn others, and so on,
each one believing he possesses the truth.
Millions will have died for what?
Do you know what you are saying?
I don’t know...
Yet you persist?
Father, I submit...
What happened?
I got to stop. My feet are a mess.
I’ll fix that.
Forget it. There’s no way they’ll last.
It’s better than nothing.
Hope you crash and burn, you bastard!
Think he’s still alive?
No way. He’s all smashed up.
What do we do? Better call the police.
Don’t do that.
They’ll keep you for hours.
Just go.
Where’d you come from?
What’s going on?
Aren’t you hurt?
I got in when you hoped he’d crash and burn.
I always get on at the last moment.
-So what do we do?
-Go.
I told you to go.
Who are you?
A labourer...
a labourer who is never out of work.
And there are millions and millions of us down there...
Down where?
Where tears are of no avail,
where repentance is useless,
where prayers go unanswered,
where good solutions are rejected,
where there is no time given for penitence,
since beyond the point of life...
there is no more time for penitence.
But I think one day we shall be saved.
On Judgement Day...
God will have mercy on us.
You, who have sore feet,
Look!
He won’t be needing them now.
Better watch out.
In Bayonne, they’ll see you with those new shoes.
Hold on. I’ll fix that.
Don’t move.
Sister, I beg of you. Stop this, recant!
No, Mother Superior, it’s useless.
I wish to suffer like Our Saviour.
Look. The Count himself, our benefactor,
came to dissuade you.
Are you suffering?
No, I feel nothing.
Now the other hand.
Sister, Christ is not asking this of you.
Closed! You can’t go in!
What were you going to do in there?
-Who us?
-Yes, you!
We wanted to visit the chapel.
Do you know why this door is closed?
This convent has been contaminated by the last of the Jansenists...
Inside, they commit the most frightening sacrilege...
they’re convulsionaries. Fanatics!
Don’t go in, whatever you do!
How do you feel, sister?
Very well.
Now go, all of you...
Don’t you want anything?
I want to be alone.
May I have a word with you, sir?
To whom have I the honour?
I am Father Billuard of the Society of Jesus.
I thought that Jesuits only came out at night...
like rats.
How dare you speak to me that way!
I’ll speak to you as I see fit.
I’m in a hurry. What do you want?
I know where you were.
I know everything that goes on in this holy place...
and I also know that you persist in denying...
the true doctrine of Grace.
With man’s corrupt nature, inner grace is irresistible.
Would you dare to repeat that in a more secluded spot?
Monsieur. I am at your disposal.
Follow me.
Will you come along and act as our seconds?
What do you mean?
We are having a duel.
Yeah, but we don’t know anything about that.
No matter! Let your conscience be your guide!
Come.
Now do you dare repeat that?
Yes, sir!
With man’s corrupt nature, inner grace is irresistible.
Grace doesn’t always achieve the effect God has intended.
One moment, please.
Would you deny that a just man, before acting,
has the necessary grace to accomplish a good deed?
Yes, I deny it!
The will is subject to the pleasures of the moment.
Worthy or unworthy, with man’s corrupt nature,
he does not necessarily have freedom...
that is free of necessity!
Worth or unworthy, with man’s corrupt nature,
he must be delivered from all necessity...
absolute or even relative.
It is a Semi-Pelagian error...
to say that Jesus Christ died for all men!
You are insulting Divine Goodness!
Christ died so that all men might achieve salvation!
Pre-existing will is wishful thinking!
My thoughts and actions are not within my power!
And my freedom is only a phantom!
Freedom! ...What does that mean anyway?
It means...
It means that between two actions, good and bad...
you can choose.
Yeah, but doesn’t God know everything?
So if I choose the bad action, He already knew it.
Sure, He always knew it.
So how can you say I’m free...
if everything I do is planned ahead of time?
It’s called free will.
God’s grace helps you choose the good.
But what if he knows I’m going to choose evil?
He’s the one that decided, not me!
Why did he decide for me to choose evil?
God works in mysterious ways.
Hey, look.
You know if they want to see our passports we’re sunk.
We’re French. An ID card’s good enough.
We’ll see.
La Concha de San Sebastian What does that mean?
The shell of San Sebastian, right?
I’ll take the Riviera.
You been there?
No. But I think I’d like it better.
What’s the difference? Got to be loaded.
C’mon or we’ll never make it to that damned Santiago.
Where are you headed?
That way, straight ahead.
Could you do us a favour?
That depends.
There is an inn about seven miles from here.
Take the donkey and wait for us there.
For how long?
Till tonight. We have to go to the village.
Take this. We must hurry!
-It’s gold!
-Of course it’s gold.
And what if you don’t make it?
Don’t worry. We’ll be there. Won’t we?
Of course.
And if we don’t come, keep everything.
See you tonight.
Thou hast died piously, adored by us.
Thou hadst received the last sacrament,
and we considered thee already among the blessed.
Alas...
after thy death, we found this manuscript...
which revealed thy secret errors.
For many, you spoke the truth.
Blood has flowed because of thee...
may God, whose love and mercy are infinite...
have mercy on thy soul.
Remove him.
Hear me.
This is the dogma...
the only truth.
There is only one God in three persons.
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
The Father is neither created nor begotten.
The Son is not created, but he is begotten.
The Holy Ghost is neither created nor begotten,
but proceedeth from the Father and the Son.
The Son and the Holy Ghost exist from all eternity...
Like the Father.
Whosoever strays from this dogma...
shall be declared a heretic!
God is one!
Listen to me!
You are being deceived!
One God cannot be divided into three!
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost...
are only names we give to Him!
It is the Father who was made flesh and who suffered!
It is the Father who died on the Cross!
The Son and the Holy Ghost are coeternal with the Father.
By an inherent and essential act of the Father!
The Father is the only God!
The Holy Ghost is only an archangel!
Seize them!
Let’s see.
Hit it?
-What was it?
-I don’t know.
something long that had no paws.
That’s funny.
I heard that the forest was full of sleepwalkers.
I haven’t seen any.
No wonder. They only come out during a full moon.
Say, what’s this?
Let’s see.
You know what it is?
No. Looks like one of those things blind people make.
It’s a rosary! The papists use it to pray to the Virgin Mary!
Get ready.
Give me a light.
What time is it?
A quarter to seven.
Time flies.
Seems like yesterday, and yet...
we’ve inherited the fruits of their labour.
The day of trial approaches.
We can’t wait for a miracle any longer.
You hear that?
There, look!
what is it?
You see her?
Yeah, but...
Look, she’s moving!
It was her! I’m sure of it!
Take it easy. You’re tired.
-You were hallucinating.
-But this?
What’ll it be?
I dunno... Some chorizo.
Same thing for me, and some red wine.
So you can’t sell the tractor?
Are you kidding? In this village they still use mules.
So what?
You sound like my grandfather.
I know what I’m talking about.
Want a taste?
Yes, please.
You’ll love it.
Delicious! Did you make it yourself?
Of course. A little more?
‘Evening, everybody.
-‘Evening, gentlemen.
-Just fine, thanks.
Someone said they saw two not-very-Christian-looking characters come in here.
Got some ID?
Let me see.
I want you out of here first thing in the morning.
‘Evening Father.
Chilly tonight.
I came in to warm up, myself.
A little ham and some wine?
It’s very tempting.
I recommend it.
I heard you’ve been promoted to sergeant.
That’s quite a promotion for a young man like you.
Maybe. But I deserved it.
Quite a career.
And your wife is having another baby?
We’re not rich; we got nothing else to do.
They’re here.
Where were you?
Thanks. We saw the donkey.
-We could put him in the stable.
-He must be hungry.
We’ll take care of that.
Good hunting?
Nothing all day.
I’m surprised.
-Got your hunting licenses?
-Of course.
No problem.
Well, that’s about it. Got to go.
-Thanks for the wine and ham.
-Don’t mention it.
See you next time. Father.
Good night, everybody.
Do you want something to eat?
-Just a room for the night.
-Fine.
Why... what’s the matter?
Are you crying?
Can I help you?
You should tell him.
-Look, Father, he...
-Quiet!
-Do you see this rosary?
-Of course.
The Virgin Mary just gave it to me.
The Virgin Mary?
-But when?
-A half-hour ago.
I saw her.
She appeared to me.
I had insulted her, made fun of her...
Father, faith does not come to us through reason,
but through the heart.
Of course.
Here, keep it.
A miracle is obviously a very moving experience,
but there’s no reason to let it affect you this way.
You know, the Virgin has appeared thousands of times,
all around the world!
And she has performed countless miracles!
Shall I tell you one?
Come, if it interests you.
And you too.
Gather round.
Now listen carefully.
A long, lone time ago,
not far from here, at a Carmelite convent,
there was a young sister,
very good, very trustworthy.
She took care of the money. A sort of sister-treasurer.
She was very orderly, very serious,
and extremely devoted to the Virgin Mary.
Now listen carefully.
Unfortunately,
one day, she was seduced by a young man.
Some claim it was the devil,
but no one knows for sure.
In any case, she fell madly in love with him
and decided to escape from the convent.
Are you with me?
On the day of her departure, that eve...
the poor Carmelite, in tears,
threw herself before the alter of the Virgin,
begged her forgiveness and prayed to her.
She placed at the Virgin’s feet
the key to the convent safe.
then she fled.
Now listen carefully.
She lived for a long time...
...excuse me...
...with her seducer.
Years.
They had children together; a boy and a girl,
but deep in her heart, she was very unhappy.
One day, unable to stand it any longer,
she decided to return to the convent.
She was ready to accept all the punishment due her.
She arrived there quietly.
It was morning,
and walking through the chapel,
she automatically turned to the statue of the Virgin.
Now listen carefully.
The key to the safe was still there!
So she went in,
trembling with fear,
but the sisters didn’t seem surprised to see her. At all!
It was as if she’d never left.
so she returned to her work,
and no one ever mentioned a word to her.
Do you know why?
Because in her absence,
the Virgin had assumed the form of the sister-treasurer,
and fulfilled all her functions.
What a beautiful miracle.
That was really a marvellous story.
That, Father, really, is beautiful.
And I have so many others!
I could go on all night!
There is no mystery sweeter or more profound...
than that of the Virgin Mary.
Well, it’s getting late. It’s time for me to go.
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight!
Follow me, please.
Let’s go.
What are you doing?
One does not light a candle to hide it under a bushel,
but to place it on a candlestick and give light.
No, your room is just across the hall. This way.
There’s room for two.
-And why not?
-Mister...
if you don’t like it you can go somewhere else.
A word of advice.
Tonight, if anyone knocks on your door, don’t open it.
-Why not?
-Just don’t answer the door.
For nobody!
Even if it’s me.
Please don’t let me disturb you.
You’re very beautiful.
You’re very kind, thank you.
You seem puzzled!
What’s your name?
-Are you from far away?
-Yes, we walked a long way.
You should rest.
As you can see, it’s very quiet here.
You’ll enjoy it.
Who is it?
It’s me. Excuse me. Would you please open the door?
-Just a second.
-Not a chance! Go away!
Listen, the father’s here.
He came back.
He wants to tell you something.
Open up.
It’s me again, my son.
Pardon me for bothering you so late, but...
but while we were talking about the Virgin Mary,
I forgot to tell you some very important things.
Open up!
Just for a minute.
No, Father, speak from where you are.
-But why?
-Because.
As you wish.
Bring me the chair, please.
I’m sure you cannot imagine the full richness...
of the mysteries of the Virgin Mary.
Think about it.
First, the Immaculate Conception.
She was conceived without original sin.
Next, the birth of Christ,
as commanded by the Holy Ghost.
And... the precious virginity of Mary!
Just imagine...
are you with me?
Yes, Father.
Don’t worry. We’re right with you.
Now listen carefully.
Just imagine that she remained a virgin...
before, during and after the birth of our Saviour.
Of course, certain heretics have denied it.
Photius and Cleobulus, for instance.
But we must believe the dogma.
Christ was born of his mother without ruining her virginity.
Do you understand that?
Yes! Like a thought that springs from the brain...
Without breaking the skull.
Like sunlight through a windowpane!
Very good!
Finally, imagine her Assumption.
Imagine she rose to heaven, in flesh and blood,
borne by the angels,
and, from up there, she intervenes for all sinners.
It’s amazing.
The dogma of the Assumption is perhaps the most beautiful.
Bring me a glass of water, please.
And if you want to please the Virgin Mary,
imagine that nothing disgusts God more...
than the sin of impurity.
Do you know why Jesus did not reply to Herod...
and did not even raise His eyes?
Because Herod was a lewd man and a fornicator,
and Jesus didn’t want to look at him.
Very good, my daughter!
You must avoid lechery like the plague!
Do you remember those hateful sects,
the Adamites and Nicolites,
who shared one another’s wives,
and indulged in debauchery!
All of them were condemned!
It is written:
the house if the impure woman is the abode of the dead
Yes, my children.
Now, open up so I can come in just for a minute.
You’re wasting your time. I’m not letting you in!
Father?
What if she and I decide to get married?
Married?
Obviously, that’s different.
Now listen to what the Apostle Paul said:
I feel it is good for a man to take no wife
You see?
Furthermore, certain theologians,
St. Thomas, for one,
believed that even for a married couple...
carnal knowledge is a venial sin.
I am a virgin, Father.
-So maybe I am without sin.
-Don’t say that!
My child no one is without sin!
Not even the Virgin Mary?
She was incapable of committing a sin, of course.
But did you know that St. Basil,
and St. John Chrysostomus,
maintained that she was guilty of several faults?
Which ones?
A little vanity, perhaps.
The desire to be admired.
They said that during the Annunciation,
she doubted the words of the angel.
And that finally at the foot of the cross,
her faith weakened somewhat.
Well, now I should let you sleep.
Can you hear me, my son?
Open the door, just for a minute.
Why? I heard everything you said.
Open up. Just for five minutes.
I said no, and I mean no.
Well at least let your friend come out!
He doesn’t want to. Now leave!
Oh, yes, the sword. Thanks.
My hatred for science and horror for technology...
will finally lead me to this absurd belief in God.
Well, well, fancy meeting you here.
Up already? On your way out?
What’s the hurry?
Got a minute?
What are you hiding there?
A ham.
And it’s a ham from the inn!
The one we tried, remember?
That’s right, it is the same.
So where’d you get this ham?
You buy it?
We bought it from the innkeeper.
-But did you really buy it?
-Yeah, and at a good deal.
You should have said so before.
Alright, you can go.
Sure you don’t want a little?
-And we got a little wine.
-No thanks. Not right now.
What about you?
Some other time.
Look Santiago!
Finally!
Well, it’s about time.
-I was getting fed up.
-Me too.
What does the dame want?
Let’s find out.
Well where’re you going? What’s the big rush?
-Going to Santiago.
-On a Pilgrimage?
You bet. And make some bread. Heard there’s a big crowd.
Take your time. There’s nobody there.
-What?
-Nobody.
The four squares around the cathedral...
used to be crowded with thousands of pilgrims.
Now it’s empty, totally empty. I mean zip.
Same thing in the hotels. All empty.
Well what happened?
Apparently, they found out that the body in the crypt wasn’t St. James’.
It’s a body without a head.
Body of a guy named Priscillien...
that they decapitated a long time ago.
Not exactly a very Christian guy from what I hear.
Where to now?
Well, you’re not in such a hurry after all.
How about a roll in the hay?
Got any money?
We even got gold.
Show me.
Take it easy. Not so fast. Well, what do you say?
C’mon.
Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.
Go ahead. Tell me!
I would like to have your child.
Why?
I’d name it, 'You Are Not My People'.
'You Are Not My People'?
And what about if we have a child?
I’d name it, 'No More Mercy'.
'No More Mercy'?
There he is!
I hear him! He is coming.
Lord, where art thou?
Stop. Listen to me!
I hear him. He is nearby.
Lord! Where art thou, Lord?
And don’t forget what I just told you.
No Lord. God forbid. Thou canst not die.
Go behind me, Satan. Out of my way...
for thy thought is not God’s,
but that of men.
Lord, here we are!
What can I do for you?
Have pity on us, son of David.
Lord, have pity on us!
Do you think it is in my power to do what you ask?
Your faith shall make it happen.
I see people.
Like trees walking.
A miracle, Lord.
I see grass, trees!
A miracle, Lord. I can see thee!
Be careful! No one must find out.
Why hide that thou hast healed them?
Sometimes, Lord, I wonder why We cannot tell of thy miracles.
At Capharnaum, thou hadst performed so many in public.
And multiplied the loaves and fishes. In the presence of thousands.
Do not believe that I am here to bring peace unto earth.
I am here not to bring peace, but the sword!
Lord, a bird has just passed.
I recognized it by the sound of its wings.
For I am here to oppose son against father, daughter against mother,
and step-daughter against step-mother.
In truth, in truth, I tell you,
man will have for enemies- the people of his own family.
Son of David, show me what is white, and what is black?
Whoever loves his father and mother more than me...
is not worthy of me.
Whoever loves his son and daughter more than me...
is not worthy of me.
