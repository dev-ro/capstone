What's going on?
Have you picked one yet?
- Yes, I think the grey one.
- You're crazy.
Rashid from Bermudastreet has
one like that in pink. Like a faggot.
- What about the red one?
- It only goes 25 km/h.
- Then this black one.
- The Aprilia? Now you're talking, bro.
- That's nice. It has an Italian engine.
- Doesn't Brahim have one?
- Which Brahim?
- Brahim from West.
That singer, right? Yes, that thing
was tuned up. It did at least 80km/h.
Van Loon, you're pissing
like a drunk tramp.
Excuse us, gentlemen.
I hope we're not disturbing you.
- Not at all.
- Hey, scooters.
- Any nice ones?
- Well the thing is...
We can't decide between
that grey one and this black one.
- I'd take the black one.
- Didn't I tell you?
Have you seen a couple of hot chicks
come by, in nurse uniforms? Two? No?
- Have you been out on the town?
- It's Tuesday.
Exactly, Tuesday night,
the weekly medicine social.
- Or don't you study medicine?
- No, we study economy.
Usually that's on Wednesday night.
But it's a swell social.
Wednesday night? They're insane.
Few nice chicks, right?
A scarcity.
But we're thinking of switching.
Understandable. Switch to medicine.
'Get over to the dark side.'
Who knows.
Yes, are we ready? Bladder empty?
Gentlemen, we're off.
- Good night, get home safe.
- Likewise, my friends.
- A scarcity?
- What should I have said instead?
- Have you picked one now?
- The black one.
Which one? I don't see it.
The Aprilia?
- Sure?
- Yes.
Couldn't you have warned me, asshole?
Come on, lift it up.
Come on, move it.
Wait.
One, two, three.
- Fuck.
- Come on.
- The grey one?
- Why not?
- Good morning.
- Zamari.
You were late yesterday.
I have to report it.
Can I have my orders?
In 30 years, your father wasn't late once.
You've been late twice in your first week.
You should be glad they hired you.
You're lucky someone didn't show up.
If you stay an extra hour
to clean the hall, I'll turn a blind eye.
- Hey, mocro.
- What's up, working man?
- What are you doing here?
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Is it any good?
- What?
- The work?
- No way.
How's your dad?
Alright.
He doesn't say hello to me anymore
when I see him in the neighbourhood.
Well, you know...
- Indiadreef. Is it far?
- Not far from our hood.
- Can you drop me off there?
- Sure.
You're going to train again?
Maybe.
- Should I wait for you?
- No, go ahead, I'll walk home.
Sure?
Shops are open late tonight.
- You want to go?
- Why not?
- Alright.
- At eight o'clock on the square.
- Good afternoon. I'm looking for Ben.
- He's training someone.
Right.
Okay, take a break.
I'm looking for Ben.
- That's me.
- Chris sent me here.
- Chris who?
- Chris Hoop.
- What did Chris say?
- That I should go to you...
- if I wanted to make some money.
- Is that what he said?
Have a seat.
I'll be with you in a minute.
High.
Hey, Ben.
Will you take long with that monkey?
I have things to do.
If you have things to do, go do them.
If you want to do it here, then sit down.
Alright, I'll sit down.
But tell him to try a bit harder.
You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
Hafid, get him some gloves.
Get ready.
Take it easy. Break.
Mike, you're okay?
- What is it?
- I want to get a book.
How often have I told you to knock?
It's my room too now.
Come here. Close the door.
Give this to Mom.
Make sure Dad doesn't see.
- Here, this is for those shoes.
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
Don't do anything stupid with
the money. I want to see a receipt.
Tarik, listen. You're the only one
who knows it's here.
If it's gone,
I'll knock your teeth out.
What the hell is that?
Did you build it yourself?
This is the last time I work with an
amateur. - This is the only one he had.
It needs work, but the engine
is perfect. It does up to 90.
90? That thing will explode at 40.
It's suicide. I'm not riding on that.
No? Then ride on this.
250. Just those two phones were worth
500 euros. That cheap motherfucker.
Look here, I have 300 in cash.
250 for the stuff, and I still have
to give that Pole 100 for the moped.
- By the way, that crazy Pole had C4.
- C-what?
- C4, you know, to blow things up with.
- Have you lost your mind?
What do you want to blow up?
Car windows?
I don't know.
Listen, are you coming into town
with the boys?
I'm going home.
I have to get up for work tomorrow.
Be healthy for a change!
Get better!
You look terrible.
I'm serious.
You look terrible.
- Doesn't Mom feed you anymore?
- Of course she does.
You know who you look like?
- Who?
- Hassan.
Which Hassan?
Hassan from the neighbourhood,
with that small bike?
Hassan from Sultan.
He's gone into hiding in Turkey.
I only heard about it two weeks ago.
They closed the place.
It got closed down by Health & Safety.
- What?
- It was full of rats and cockroaches.
I never ate there anymore anyway.
Remember when you got sick there?
Everything came out again.
Out of both ends.
I'd love one of those sandwiches right now.
Majid, you have to do
something for me.
You have to get something
from my place.
What's that?
It's in a small silver tin in my desk.
- What's that all about?
- About the house.
- Which house?
- Our house in Morocco.
- What about it?
- They want to sell it.
- Why?
- I think they need money for Hamza.
Dad said we'll buy a new house
when Hamza gets better.
When he gets better?
Is that what Dad said?
Yes.
Don't stay out here too long, alright?
Yes, Zamari, Abdel-Majid.
Your second week
at the flower auction, right?
- How's it going?
- It's going fine.
Really?
Because I've received
a first official complaint.
- What about?
- You were late. Three days ago.
- I made up for it.
- Still, it's in here. This is what counts.
So I have to give you
a first official warning.
After the third warning you're out of the
program and will have to do the time.
That you're here is a privilege,
not a right.
It's a chance to show you can behave.
Because I have fifty pages here
that say you can't.
If you do your best, they may hire you.
Four days a week makes a nice salary.
Does it?
I don't see any fancy cars
parked outside there.
What do you want to do
instead of this?
I don't see a lot of qualifications here.
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know. Definitely not work there.
- How are things at home?
- Fine.
Did you arrange your health insurance?
Did you take a look
at the brochures I gave you?
I meant to, but I lost them.
Look here. And this one.
Read this one as well.
This shit took place
like 100 years ago.
You see this black dude.
There were no blacks here yet.
Those Dutch people looked at him
like he'd escaped from the circus.
But his Dutch was perfect.
I was jealous.
He's just arrived by boat
and he immediately goes:
'Good afternoon, sir, here I am,
could I have some Dutch mashed potato? '
Not even the queen talks like that.
- Who's that? A cop?
- No, I know him.
- Everything alright?
- Yes, yourself?
Fine.
What can I do for you?
That guy you fought?
You broke his jaw.
- If you come for money, I have none.
- No, that's not it.
Next weekend would be his first
tournament. Now I'm a fighter short.
- How much does it pay?
- If you win, 750 euros.
250 for me as your manager.
- Are you my manager now?
- Yes, for that day.
- Do you work?
- Yes.
- Where?
- At the flower auction. Why?
Good, that's in the morning, right?
Then I'll see you every day at four.
Miss one day
and the deal's off.
- Deal?
- Alright.
- Majid, how are you?
- Fine, and you?
How can I help you?
I've heard you want to buy
my parents' house.
- That's true.
- For how much?
- 60,000 euros. A good price.
- Listen.
Call them tomorrow
and tell them the deal is off.
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?
- Because I'm asking you.
- Get lost.
This is a free country.
I can do what I want.
You really think this is a free country?
Then I'm free to come here every day.
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
Take a break.
What did you say? 15 euros?
Let me get my wallet.
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it from a Somalian.
- Why?
- It's cool, isn't it?
Cool? Sure, if you're a clown.
- One day you'll let your money burn.
- What money?
- What's that dude doing here?
- He's getting on my nerves.
Where were you, faggot?
You said you'd come, but you didn't.
- Who are you calling a faggot?
- You.
You don't answer, you don't call back.
Where's my money?
- Calm down, you'll get it.
- You've been saying that for weeks.
If I don't get it tomorrow
I'll break your neck.
Who's breaking what?
- Nothing, bro.
- Who is this guy?
Listen, I don't mean to disrespect you,
but this guy is taking the piss.
- But you do disrespect me, asshole.
- See what I mean?
This man calls me for shit,
I give it to him, he doesn't pay me.
- I was busy.
- Busy with what?
- Busy smoking up your money, okay?
- Relax.
Come with me.
Just come with me.
How much does he owe you?
- 600.
- That much?
It was 500. I've been waiting all week.
I have costs too. Calling him and stuff.
100 euros in phone calls.
You call from Zaire? No, right?
What is this bullshit?
- How much do you have on you?
- What?
- How much do you have?
- Now?
- Yes, how much?
- I don't know. 100.
Give it up.
- That's 200, you fag.
- So what?
I'll tell him he'll get the rest next
week. - And what do I have to live off?
- Here.
- This is a human rights violation.
Here.
He'll bring the rest next week.
But don't come around here shooting
your mouth of again.
Vleermuis, show him your wallet.
Come on, show him your wallet.
What do you need that for?
Are you a clown?
I didn't know you sold that shit.
Sometimes people call me
for a gram or two. Nothing major.
- As long as you don't use it yourself.
- Of course not.
That's easy for you to say,
but I was here by myself all summer.
Not that I depend on it.
But it changes things.
And there's good money in it.
This is the part I like.
- It's still quiet, isn't it?
- Does that surprise you?
You think people will pay money
to see these clowns fight? Look.
Who is that guy?
Hakan Atesh.
He's supposed to be a major player.
I saw him at a fight this summer.
Turned out he'd paid for everything.
Fuck this shit.
What am I going to do with you?
That guy didn't stand a chance.
You were killing him.
Is it so hard to stop
when the ref tells you to stop?
To go to the corner
and wait for your applause?
Is that so hard?
Answer me!
Is that so fucking hard?
You really fucked up.
You can say goodbye to the prize money.
The champ is here.
Was that guy angry?
Well, fuck him.
I thought it was a good fight.
So, are we going to that after-party?
Come on, we have to celebrate this.
What's there to celebrate?
I didn't even get the money.
Forget the money.
Tonight we'll drink, dance and fuck.
Tomorrow
we'll worry about money again.
But seriously, that guy stayed
on his feet a long time.
I had to go into the ring
to finish it myself.
I thought you entered the ring
to be a ring girl.
Asshole.
What's this guy trying to do.
Get out of the way.
Asshole.
- Hakan wants you to have this.
- Thank him from me, but I don't want it.
Take it, he made good money tonight.
- Stop by at coffee house Mavi Kösk.
- Alright, I will when I have a chance.
Two whiskey and colas, please.
Wait here, okay?
- Come with me.
- Why?
Because I'm asking you.
What are you doing here?
- You're deaf? What are you doing here?
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
I don't hear from you for six months
and now you ask me what I'm doing here?
Yes.
- Yes, what?
- Yes, that's what I'm asking.
You've really lost the plot, haven't you?
Okay, I'm here with Joyce
because we've been working...
Joyce is a whore.
Those guys at your table are pimps.
You hang out with those people these days?
Sounds like a perfect match,
doesn't it?
- I don't need this.
- Who says you need it?
You fought like a lion and beat
that guy to pulp. You've earned it.
I enjoyed beating that guy up.
I don't work for people I don't know.
And I enjoyed watching it.
As my nephew said,
I'd be interested in talking to you.
Who knows what we can do
for each other.
They talk about you at school.
What do they say?
That you beat someone to death.
Do you believe that?
Fine.
You should have been there.
It was like he never fought before.
He kept taking punches.
Then everyone started shouting
and pushing and pulling. Total chaos.
Even he jumped into the ring.
I swear, if they hadn't stopped me,
I'd have destroyed one of those guys.
People don't know that I'm the real
secret weapon of the neighbourhood.
Majid, who used to take you
to that shit?
- The bus.
- Tell them who took you to karate.
I did. I took him.
You know why? Every day he came
home from school covered in bruises.
One day my father said to me:
Take him with you.
The first time we were all in karate
suits, he was the only one in jeans.
You know how thin he was?
Like this.
In the end I quit, but if I'd continued...
it really would have been off the hook.
Why did you quit?
I tell you, lying on the mat
with all those sweaty guys.
One leg this way,
the other leg that way.
- You have a point.
- That's not for me. I'm no faggot.
Lend me your car.
- Why?
- I have to take care of something.
A chick?
When will I see you again?
- I don't know. I'm busy.
- Busy. With what?
Stuff. Working, training.
Call me tomorrow.
- What are you doing?
- Checking the backseat, you faggot.
This jalopy is a heap of dirt anyway.
Who were you with?
With that Tessa, right?
That broad is crazy in the head.
She was asking about you all summer.
You know she's a slut, right?
She was going out with everyone.
She even tried it with me.
I told her I didn't want your crumbs.
- I'm not a dustbuster.
- Police.
- Anything funny in the car?
- No, nothing.
- Driver's license?
- My brother's.
Good evening.
License and registration, please.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just a routine check.
What are you looking for?
You may get out and go to one
of my colleagues. Yes, thank you.
Can you take that out?
- What's this?
- A rock.
- I see that. Why do you carry it around?
- Is it forbidden?
Depends on what you intend
to do with it.
I intend to put it in my fish bowl.
Can I have it back?
You like that, don't you?
Dirty faggot.
License and registration
are in order.
Alright, Mr Naufal Hamedi.
You can go.
Have a nice evening.
- I need money, Adil.
- How much?
- A lot.
- What for?
Some stuff.
Well?
I'm going inside.
Thanks.
Help yourself.
- Water?
- Yes, please.
Even though you screwed up,
it seems you made an impression.
You have two requests
for tournaments.
It's the first time in six years
Chris sent someone to me.
Look, Majid...
you're not the brightest, but I tell you,
I can make a champion out of you.
People will be proud of you.
You can even make a lot of money.
I'm not worried about the fighting.
What I do want to know is if you're
planning to go back to Chris soon.
To do community service work,
if you know what I mean.
In that case, just tell me.
It's fine with me.
You can come and train once a week,
but then I won't invest any energy in you.
- What's that?
- Food.
I don't think I can have this.
I don't think it'll kill you.
Come, I'll leave it there.
I've brought you your rock.
You know how long I've had it?
Oualidia.
Remember?
You, me, Tarik, Mom, Dad.
We stayed on the beach all day,
till the sun went down.
That was a nice day.
Tarik said you started boxing again.
Yes.
Maybe I'll come and watch next time.
What are you doing to me?
What are you doing to me?
You little rat.
Stay out of it, you punk.
It's your fault, you hear me?
If it wasn't for your mother,
I'd throw you out on the street.
I've worked hard in this country
for 30 years.
On the bicycle
through rain, snow and heat.
And for what? To raise a thief
who carries my name.
A thief they take out of bed in the middle
of the night for the whole street to see.
Do you have any idea how people
look at me at the mosque?
But how could you know?
You never go there.
Listen carefully.
As God is my witness...
I will not let my youngest son
follow the same path.
Do you hear me? You devil.
Will you tell me what all that was about?
- A letter came from school.
- What kind of letter?
- That I'd been absent for two days.
- Where were you?
Don't do that again, you hear?
Or I'll hit you so hard
you'll never forget it.
You know what happens with boys
who don't finish school?
They become like Adil and me.
Is that what you want?
No.
Eat your burger, it's getting cold.
- Aren't you going to eat?
- Yes, in a minute.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
It doesn't look like nothing.
Tell that black monkey
to sit down or I'll hurt him.
What's your problem, asshole? - You are,
if you don't mind your own business.
Please, Sergio, sit down.
Mind my own business?
This is my business.
You came to my table, right?
Your faggot friend never gave me the money.
Eat your chicken.
Take him home and come straight back.
Majid, please.
What are you doing?
Stop. Majid, please, stop.
Fuck.
He was carrying this?
That lunatic. You should have
shot him, if only just to punish him.
- Just in his leg.
- Give here.
Let me dump it for you. If they
catch you with it, you're fucked.
Have you seen those Turks yet?
- No.
- Are you going to see them?
I don't know. What do you think?
They make good money.
Did you see the BMW he rides in?
You know one day I'll be driving
through the hood with a ride like that.
That car does 250.
But I'll only do 10.
You know why? So you guys
can have an even better look at it.
Yes, you have to burn inside.
- A BMW, right?
- Yes, buddy. A Mercedes is fine too.
The only time you'll drive a Mercedes
is when you become a taxi driver.
Anything new?
How long were you standing there?
A couple of minutes.
Why don't you pray?
You heard me.
It's not for me.
Praying is a good thing.
What good has it brought you?
Peace.
- Peace?
- Yes, peace.
I know where I'm going.
I also know where I'm going.
Police, show your hands.
On your knees.
Dad.
If they ask you, we walked home
together and stayed out for a while.
We went home together.
Good afternoon, madam.
I hope this is the right address.
We brought you flowers
because you called the police...
and thereby saved the life
of one of our best friends.
I'd almost say yes, they're so lovely.
But it's two doors down, second floor.
Betsy is her name.
Betsy Molenaar.
Mom, I know you're there.
Open up.
I know you hear me. Open up,
I have to tell you something.
Mom? Mom?
I can't let you in.
Why not?
- Mom.
- It's better this way. Also for Tarik.
Is Dad home?
Let me in for just one minute.
I need to get some clothes.
You can't leave me out
in the freezing cold.
- Keep it.
- I can't accept it.
Use it to buy the things the police
broke and anything else you need.
Take care of yourself.
They really fixed up
this neighbourhood.
I used to come here a lot.
A kid on my soccer team lived here.
A Turkish guy, Gökan.
Gökan Dohan?
Yes, a good kid,
a good soccer player. Fast too.
- He was a left winger.
- His father is a thief.
It wouldn't surprise me
if his son became one as well.
Baris has a meeting tomorrow. I want
you to go with him, to keep an eye out.
If something happens you don't like,
you intervene.
If nothing happens, you do nothing.
Either way you'll get paid.
- How much?
- 4000 euros. For 15 minutes of work.
Interested?
You know what it is
with you Moroccans?
The first 30 years you were here, all
you did was sleep. And steal bicycles.
Now I see you on TV every day.
Singing, dancing.
- Where are we going?
- Breda.
What's there?
M'barik,
but everyone calls me Barry.
They're upstairs.
- Why isn't Hakan here? I don't trust it.
- Shut up and wait.
- Something's wrong.
- Shut up.
- Do you know them?
- Relax, I know these guys.
Show them.
- I really don't like this.
- Shut up.
- Let's go.
- Wait, stay here.
Why do you talk?
Who is he?
Moroccan, right?
Where's that old Turk?
I don't know where he is.
We've come here to do business.
- Calm down.
- No problem.
- No problem.
- Weapons down or I'll shoot him.
Stay calm, guys.
Let's talk this over.
A big shot, aren't you?
You want to shoot him? Go ahead.
- Don't shoot.
- Are you sure?
You have the same Tangier accent.
And you have the same nose.
You want to tell your mother
your brother was shot in the head?
So what will it be?
Calm down.
You too, drop it.
Listen everyone,
we can do this the hard way.
We've come here to sell something.
Do you have the money?
Otherwise we'll take our stuff
and walk out of here.
Do you have it?
Check it.
Alright.
Everyone cool?
Do you have what you want?
I don't want any more bullshit.
Hakan says you can choose.
4000 cash...
or this.
Majid.
That Tessa, is she with you?
Yes.
I got a surprising call
from your foreman.
They're very happy with you.
He wanted to emphasize that,
after that initial misunderstanding.
- That makes me very happy.
- Yes, me too.
I think a permanent contract
is a real possibility.
Majid, this is John Terpijn.
Do you know that name?
John is the organizer of Max Promo.
This is the kid I told you about.
Majid Zamari.
I saw you fight two weeks ago.
Against that German. Very impressive.
You understand that what we do
is a few levels higher.
There you'll be facing professionals
who train every day.
Hakan says you train hard,
that you want to move up.
- I do.
- I'm organizing an event soon.
And there's a fighter who dropped out.
Maybe it's something for you.
You can get a taste of the real stuff,
and we can see what you're made of.
This kid is made of steel.
You'll see.
Is that true?
Did you talk to those Turks?
- About what?
- About me.
- I can do the same shit you do for them.
- It's going fine as it is.
Of course.
But it can go even better, right?
I'll talk to them.
Pull over.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Then what are you here for?
- I'm with Ashraf, Kemal and Lahti.
I'm not asking who you're with.
I can see you're with scum.
Ashraf, Kemal and Lahti are all scum.
Their brothers, their fathers,
even their sisters are scum.
So what are you doing here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- How's Mom?
- Fine.
- Dad?
- Also fine.
Hamza?
Go on home, alright?
Take a break.
Majid.
The guys from Max Promo called me.
They want you for the next tournament.
Do you know anything about that?
Serious stuff. Professional fighters,
no losers like you're fighting now.
It's about money, a lot of money.
It means you'll have to train
twice a day, at the very least.
Majid, I'm glad you're here.
We were talking about you
and Sergio, and this situation.
Sergio's uncle is a good friend of mine.
I think we should talk this over.
It seems one is owed money
by a friend of the other.
And one threatened
the other with a gun.
Those are sensitive issues
that have led to some tension.
As far as that gun is concerned,
I'm already happy it didn't get used.
For me two things are important.
First, I don't want to draw
the attention of the cops.
And I don't want my nephew
to do any stupid things he'll regret.
He only does stupid things,
that's why he looks like that.
I understand you.
The first thing also applies to us.
That's why I want to settle this
once and for all.
But I also have a financial matter.
Hospitals aren't cheap these days.
On top of that, my nephew
hasn't been able to work for a while.
Shall we say ten?
To smoothen things out a little?
Your friend's uncle is a dangerous
man. He's an old jungle commando.
Don't underestimate him.
I have something that's perfect
for you and your friends.
A robbery of a money transport,
the morning before Christmas.
You know how many people
will go shopping for presents that day?
All the ATM machines
get filled up for that day.
They have to do so
before the shops open.
And because it's so busy,
there's only one armed guard per car.
Our man on the inside says
that every car...
carries about 2 million euros that day.
- I don't know if we're up for that.
- Oh no?
I've heard you switched from stealing
mopeds to blowing up ATM machines.
- You're well-informed.
- We have very reliable information.
Including the route
of the money transport.
We'll finance
all the equipment you'll need.
We take 40 percent. If you do it with
five men, you'll easily have 200K each.
That's a lot of money.
I don't know.
I have that fight two days later.
Are you watching
or am I watching this film by myself?
I've already seen it, you know.
Are you okay?
Hamza, are you okay?
What are you doing?
Don't get up.
Do you have to pee?
- Do you have to pee?
- Don't know.
You know I can still beat your ass, right?
Of course you can.
Sorry.
It's okay.
- How does it feel?
- What?
To beat someone to pulp.
Why do you want to know?
No reason.
I just want to know.
Well?
I don't feel anything.
Sometimes I just have to.
If someone is acting tough
or whatever...
I just have to hurt that person.
Otherwise I can't go home.
Then I can't face myself anymore.
Majid, I'm not gonna lie,
but that guy looks dangerous.
- Those Yugos are all dangerous.
- I'm definitely betting on the Dragon.
Bitches are going to love this shit.
Handsome, toned, the whole package.
Are you interested?
Do you want his number?
You know what my brother says? That
if he wins this match, he can be a pro.
He knows one of those fighters.
They get 10,000 euros for one fight.
- That's impossible.
- For one fight. Check it yourself.
- Your brother talks a lot, doesn't he?
- Yes, he does.
He also says this guy is going
to stick his hand up your ass...
until it comes out of your mouth.
Did you bring your passport?
Good.
Where are we going?
You'll see.
But we're not going to work.
Do you know what used to be here?
Nothing. Just a mountain
and some goats...
and a shack my father grew up in
with six brothers and three sisters.
Now there are three hotels
that all belong to my family.
As a child I always played
with the kid next door, Frank.
We hadn't been in the Netherlands long.
Frank and I would play soccer.
Or with those little balls...
What are they called?
They're made of glass.
- Marbles.
- Yes, marbles.
We had those big black ones.
One day I didn't see Frank anymore. Imagine,
we used to see each other every day.
If I asked, his mother would tell me
she had no idea where he was.
Until one day I ran into him on the street.
He was with some other Dutch kids.
They were playing with marbles.
I got mine out and wanted to join them.
'You can't play with us.'
'Why not? ' I asked him.
'Because my father says
you're filthy Turks.'
The other kids
couldn't stop laughing.
Before Frank could say anything,
I hit him in the eye with my marble.
A large cut in his eyebrow, blood
gushing out. The other kids ran off.
Two weeks later
our neighbours had moved.
And three weeks later someone had
painted 'filthy Turk' on my father's van.
I never saw Frank again,
until last year.
You know where I saw him?
Here by the pool.
It was still morning, and he was
already drunk from the free cocktails.
All sweaty and sunburned.
He looked just like his father, only
fatter and with a scar above his eye.
There he was, among the filthy Turks
in filthy Turkey.
Eight days all-in
in the cheapest room.
Majid, this is Omer, one of my
oldest friends and business partners.
I love this place.
How's your training going?
Alright.
Is it working out with Ben?
There's a lot at stake in that fight.
Do you know the guy you're fighting,
the Yugoslavian?
- I know who he is.
- He's a strong fighter.
Big as well. I've seen him fight a few
times. He's a madmen in the ring.
Thank you...
- Do you think you have a chance?
- Of course.
It wouldn't be a disgrace if you lost.
You're still young
and have an excellent reputation.
You'll have plenty of chances.
What I mean to say is this.
If you feel like: I won't pull it off...
there's still a lot of money to be made,
if you know what I mean.
More than you'll get if you win.
I can handle him.
Alright.
- What do you think you're doing here?
- Training.
What do you think? That you can
just show up whenever you like?
Where were you all week?
You were meant to train twice a day,
instead I haven't seen you at all.
I called you, I went to your father, who
also told me interesting stuff about you.
- What the hell's going on, Majid?
- Nothing. Can we just start?
Start with what? Do you think I'm crazy
and will let you enter the ring like this?
You know what you can do? Call those people
and tell them you're withdrawing.
- Or you can go by yourself, without me.
- Fine, I'll go by myself.
- Sure, go ahead. Walk away again.
- Fine.
Do what you do best, disappear.
Make your father proud.
And your brother.
What?
What did you say?
- Say it again.
- What do you think?
That I'm some kind of pimp
who's afraid of you?
Now get the fuck out of my gym.
- Are you going to tell me or what?
- Relax, dude, you'll hear in a minute.
First of all, thank you for coming.
I spoke to some of you yesterday,
some of you are just back from the sun.
The reason I asked you to come
is because I trust you.
And I want you to make money.
Now I happen to know a way to do so.
In two weeks it'll be Christmas.
You know what that means, right?
People will go shopping like crazy.
What do you need for that?
- Cash.
- Right. And where does cash come from?
ATM machines. And they fill them all
the way up the day before Christmas.
- We're blowing up ATM machines again?
- Even better.
We're going to rob
the truck that fills them.
- Does this plan come from the Turks?
- What does it matter?
- Yes, right?
- Can't I do business with those Turks?
Are you the boss now?
Should they only talk to you?
Did I say that? - No, but what's
the problem? Are you jealous?
- Get out of here.
- So what's the problem?
If you want to wave guns around like
a cowboy, go ahead, but I won't do it.
- Oh no?
- No.
Who fixed it when you were waving
a gun around because of some slut?
Who had to go to Betsy Molenaar?
I think it was me.
That was different.
Does Betsy Molenaar shoot back?
This is madness.
Especially with those guys.
- Forget it, I'm out. Good luck.
- That's impossible.
- What's impossible?
- I told those Turks you're in.
- Do you get to decide that for me?
- Yes.
Yes? Fuck you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Did he bring the money?
- You have the money?
Shotgun, Uzi, AK-47.
How much is the AK?
2500 euros each.
100 for an extra clip.
I'll take five.
And ten extra cartridges.
- Here you go.
- Step back.
What have I done to God
for Him to take the wrong son?
- Am I not your son?
- Have you gone crazy?
- Am I not your son?
- Go away.
Am I not your son?
Am I not your son?
I thought you'd be here.
I heard about your brother.
I'm sorry.
Have you found someone
for that thing?
No.
Get out.
Now.
Get out.
- Get out, now.
- Get out or we'll blow you the fuck up.
Come on, get out.
Hands on your head.
Hands on your head.
Look down.
Look down.
- Keys.
- I don't have them.
- Where are the keys?
- I don't have them.
- Don't act tough. Where are they?
- I don't have them.
- Where are the keys?
- In my pocket, my right pocket.
- Get them out.
- Get them out.
Reda! Come.
Get these, get these.
Watch it.
Hey Sous, quick, quick.
Quick, quick.
Come on.
It's much too soon.
Come on, to the car, let's go.
Don't stop, keep going.
Keep going.
- No, let's go.
- Keep going. Keep going.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, we'll keep going.
- Let's go, now.
- Keep going.
Get in the car, get in the car now.
- Hey, Sous, step on it.
- It won't go any faster.
- Right, turn right.
- Sous, keep going.
- What the fuck did you start shooting for?
- What should I've done?
Keep calm, idiot.
What's the matter?
Hey, Vleermuis.
Hey, Lerin.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
- There's blood everywhere.
- Is he still breathing?
A little bit.
- Drive to the hospital.
- No, no, no.
- Shut up, drive to the hospital.
- No, to the other car.
- Sous, drive to the hospital.
- No, drive to the other car.
- I can just leave him at the entrance.
- Shut up and drive to the other car.
Are you crazy?
Look at him, he's dying.
It's too late anyway.
And what do you think they'll do?
They'll give him some drugs
so he'll live just long enough to talk.
Is that all you can think of?
We've known his brother for years.
You want to serve time for him?
- Sous, go on.
- I should've stayed out.
- Hey, he's not okay.
- Press your hand on the wound.
Bro, keep driving.
- You know it's your fault, right?
- Shit happens.
- What was that?
- Didn't you hear me?
What did you say?
- Let's not do anything crazy.
- What did you want to do?
Hey, come and help unload the car
instead of fighting before the cops come.
- There's not that much to unload.
- What?
Maybe 200,000 euros, that's all.
- What do you mean?
- Then we have 20,000 each.
I'm coming for my share tomorrow.
And his share.
At an extremely violent robbery in Utrecht
a security guard was killed this morning.
The employee of the company STS was
probably shot down by the robbers.
They used heavy automatic guns
and explosives.
The police had to give up the pursuit.
Police spokesman Henk...
Tessa.
Get in and I'll take you home.
Come on.
Have I ever done anything to you?
People always think
he's the strongest of us two.
But I'm the smartest.
I plan all our shit. I'm the general.
I got him out of jail some time ago.
I have to do everything for him.
Look in the glove compartment.
Did you know I always told him
to chase after you?
You're pretty, you're smart.
And what is he, really?
But you know how stubborn he is.
Nothing gets through
to that brain of his.
Come here.
Come a little closer.
What's your problem?
No.
New developments.
We reported earlier
that a 35-year-old guard had died.
A second victim has been found
near the burned-out getaway car.
It's the body of an 18-year-old man...
who was probably one of the robbers
and was left behind.
Hey, Sous. Yes, it's me.
Listen, have you heard from Adil?
He's not answering his phone.
It's okay, I'll call him later. Listen.
You have family in Maastricht, right?
Go stay with them for a few days,
till things quieten down.
- What happened to your eye?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?
- Never mind.
Tell me what happened to your eye or
I'll do the same thing to your other eye.
I went to the Risk last night. I was
going crazy in here. I had to get out.
You know who was there?
Baris, you know, that filthy Turk.
- You know who he was with?
- Who?
Tessa. And believe me, they were
acting all loving and horny and shit.
And I was sitting there. They saw
me too, so I had to say something.
Before I had a chance to hit
that filthy Turk...
all his friends were punching me.
I swear, if that bastard had been
by himself I would have killed him.
- Do you have my money?
- Not here. I've hidden it.
Okay, I'll resolve it.
But I need a favour.
Don't come to the fight tomorrow.
Wait for me at 23:00 in the parking lot.
Bring the money
and drive me to Brussels.
Then you sell the car
and give my share to my parents.
Is the moped still here?
Give me the keys.
At 23:00.
What do you want?
Tarik, it's me. Tell me, are there
people visiting? Who are they?
Say it's someone from your class.
Tarik, you've got do something for me.
Remember when we had burgers?
Our secret? This is the same thing.
Tell Mom you're going to Anas
but come to the roof instead.
Today you can, because I'm there.
But come by yourself, okay? Alright.
Come.
Listen up, I don't have much time.
Remember where I hide my money?
- Under the bed.
- Exactly.
Hide this there as well.
Wait till New Year, then give it to Mom.
I'll put it in this pocket.
This I put in your other pocket.
It's for Hatim's parents.
Isn't that the name of Vleermuis' brother?
Tell them it's to cover
this week's expenses.
Listen, Tarik, this is very important.
I'm going away for a while.
That means you'll be the oldest now.
What you have to do is for strong men.
Are you a strong man?
Wait here for ten minutes, then go
downstairs and hide the money.
Here. Ten minutes, alright?
What's the matter with you?
First you and your friends made us
lose handfuls of money on that heist.
And to thank me for not shooting you
right away, you do this to my nephew.
I thought you had potential.
Remember what we talked about
over dinner in Alanya?
Do you remember?
The second round.
Then we can put this all behind us.
Do you understand?
Great.
Majid, I trust that you
and Baris will resolve this.
Baris, take it easy, he still has to
fight. - Who do you think you're talking to?
Put his hand on that stool.
What are you doing?
