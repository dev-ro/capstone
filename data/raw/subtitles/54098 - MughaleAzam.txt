I am Hindustan
The Himalayas
watch over my borders
The waters of the holy Ganges
I have sworn by
Since the beginning of time,
darkness and light...
have been my companions
The foundations of marbled monuments
that rise from my ashes...
lie embedded in deeper depths
than of Earth herself
I was plundered by barbarians
and saved by the merciful
The unwise tied me in chains.
Those who loved me have freed me
Of those who loved this land,
one was Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar
Akbar transcended the barriers
of religion and tradition
He taught man to love his fellow man.
Thus he embraced this country
This is Emperor Akbar's palace
In this palace live
stories of the past
Some four centuries ago,
far from this grand palace...
a man walked through the burning sands
of the sunswept desert barefoot
This man who walks alone
is Emperor Akbar
There is sadness in his eyes,
for he has not yet fathered an heir
Akbar is travelling to meet
the Holy One, Salimuddin Chisti
He travels in hope that the blessings
of the Holy One may beget him an heir
The royal procession follows. But
Akbar walks. For he has taken the vow
Finally, the destination
is arrived at
The Emperor before whom the world
bows to, stands before a mendicant
Seek as one should seek, for God
never refuses the faithful
Raise your hands in prayer,
and I shall pray with you
O'Emperor of Emperors, Thou hast
bestowed upon this humble man...
every blessing that
life has to offer
I have heard people call me
their emperor
Now, please let me hear
the word father
O'Lord of Heaven and Earth,
let Akbar not die without an heir
May Jodha be made fertile
by His grace
Felicitations! Felicitations
to the Emperor
The Lord has blessed
the Queen's womb
The Emperor has a son,
and the Empire an heir
Allah be praised!
You bring happy tidings
to a sad Akbar!
Keep this ring. Keep it with you
as a mark of my promise
By the sacred scales of Justice,
I swear
Whatever you seek of Akbar,
for once in your life...
shall be given
With the passage of time, the prince
began to develop certain tastes
Prince...
These scales are not meant
for you to play with
Are they for The Emperor to play with?
- No. The sacred scales are...
a memorial to Emperor Babar,
and they signify Mughal justice
How profound
This is what you have to speak
in court. Memorise it
Is this a command?
- No, a request
Then I shall try
The Prince became
more and more disobedient
And he began to transgress the limits
of etiquette and protocol
Take it away, with all due respect
One day, Prince Salim, the heir to
the Mughal throne took to drinking
Emperor Akbar realised that
a dark future awaited Hindustan
The symbol of Mughal justice shall not
be a wayward Prince's plaything
Man Singh
No more for him, the security
of his mother's love
Cast him in steel
Take him away. Temper the steel
in the desert fires
I entrust you with the future
of the Mughal Empire
For a child it's a mother's lap,
not the shadow of war
Lord, grant me that my love may shield
my son from the enemy swords
The Prince sends his chain of mail
from the battlefield
My Salim!
Salim has lived up to my expectations.
I am pleased
Salim! My son!
You are the Empress of Hindustan!
No, O'Mighty One. A mother
is nothing more than a mother
The frailty of a mother's emotions
overcomes Empress Jodha?
That she forgets her status?
This I knew not
What political prerogatives
that forbid...
a mother to long for a son
being bled callously?
Suffer then, but not in tears
Were all mothers whose sons are on the
battlefield with yours, to break down...
then Hindustan will be
drowned in tears
As much gold as the Prince's chain of
mail weighs, be distributed to charity
For 14 years Salim was tempered amidst
the storms of battle in the deserts
Why have the Prince's wounds
not been dressed yet?
We haven't been given permission
to enter
May I beg to be excused?
May the Prince's wounds
not be dressed?
Not wounds. These are flowers.
Nature rules that flowers shall wilt
Hear this
Not just an assassin'
this has a heart too
This is as much a branch of a tree
as it is a sword
Surely, this dumb sword is
no princess for a romance?
Not merely with the eyes of a soldier
do I see this piece of steel
Not that soldier who wields the sword
only in bloodletting
Then what is it that
the Prince wields?
In my hand, this dancing blade is like
a woman in throes, in her lover's arms
Then rises the blood, that spreads
in a blush over her face
Poetry, even after fourteen years
of bloodletting... strange
There is nothing strange
Were Omar Khayyam's anthology,
the Rubaiyat...
to have been etched on stone, not
to have been timed for recitation...
would it's meaning be any the less?
- No
Then those designs that The Mighty One
may have for me, are founded in error
The armour you wore to the victory
is to be presented to The Mighty One
Are these years of my bloodied youth
not enough?
Not the armour. Rather this story
of my life, bloodied and in ashes
And my son shall present this story
of your life to The Mighty One
Ride with the despatch
Attention all ye
The Mighty One's foresight
has been proved right again
The Prince has emerged victorious
again
Does he carry the wounds of battle?
Several. Countless swords
he has braved and broken
And every enemy sword proved
again and again...
the Prince's valour, and the might
of the blood of Akbar
I shall inspect Salim's armour
Instead of the armour, the Prince
sends The Mighty One this missive
Read it out. Loudly
Before the Emperor of Hindustan,
Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar, I bow
Before You, I present this account...
of every yard of the terrain
steeped in Your royal blood
For fourteen years the fires of war
that ravaged this land...
sucked from my veins Your blood
that these fires took to quench
But Your Salim has still blood left,
to bloody the Deccan plateau...
should You so command.
In subservience, Your Salim
Allah be praised
From Salim I take heart
Prince Noor-ud-din Mohammed Salim
be ordered to march for home
Felicitations to The Mighty One
on Prince Salim's return
Felicitations!
Lord, why are you still silent?
Just let me see Salim's face
The Emperor has ordered Durjan Singh
to bring the Prince back immediately
You are the bearer of news
that turns tears to smiles!
Pearls, Bahar! Pearls for your words!
- Far too little, Your Majesty
I want the Prince to walk over
a carpet of pearls
For Salim, anything!
My son is coming home after years!
I shall pray to The Mighty One...
that He lets my son be with me
for a few days
His father's politics he has learnt;
his mother's love he hasn't known
Tell the courtesans to choreograph
a performance beautiful enough...
to make Salim forget
the pictures of war
Tell the court musician Tansen
to write tunes so dulcet...
to make Salim forget
the thunder of cannon
And flowers, Bahar! Flowers for him!
And light up the city!
Stars for him to tread upon, and
a heaven as far as the eye beholds!
O'everything! Everything I want
for him! And everything I cannot say
Lord! Bring me to that moment when
I may behold my son before my eyes!
Then for a moment, You too
I shall forget
Sculptor
The jewel of the palace
in my humble workshop?
I have to choose a sculpture
for the Prince
The sculptures I carve,
Princes and Emperors cannot appreciate
Why?
- For they speak the truth
Behold, the court where every word
spoken by The Emperor is law...
against which, there is no appeal
And this, the field of battle
The blood of innocents,
for the victory of one man
This is the price of truth
Punishment by death.
- Not true, sculptor
May I present to the artiste
a rhetoric?
Meaning?
- Whereas I appreciate your art...
what art is it that touches
not the heart?
What figurine therefore,
which fails to woo the vain?
Then at the feet of the idol I sculpt
the soldier shall lay down his sword...
Emperors shall lay down
their crowns...
and men will carve out
their hearts in oblation
What have you done?
The crown is to be presented
to the wearer
The hands that crown are others'
but the courage is one's own
Bahar, have you no fear that
someone might see you?
Fear?
No crown is worn on a head that fears
You wish to become the Empress
of this grand empire?
How many girls would be
dreaming the same?
Then let them dream
Look at my eyes
- Such beautiful eyes!
Like the drunken reveller
who jabs his sword at the skies...
are you too aiming for the stars?
- Stars do fall out of the skies
For vain princes,
one look of the eye is enough
As with death, so also with
the hearts of Princes
You can never know when
I wish for it the soonest
Your Majesty, two hours for sunrise.
The last pearl for the night
The price may be paid
Shall The Mighty One welcome
His son in battle-gear?
Not my son. I go to greet
a great soldier of Hindustan
I have not seen Salim grown up.
Do not present him to me unannounced
News of the Prince!
He has entered the palace
May I be rewarded?
The Emperor welcomed
the Prince Himself!
Before he could bow,
The Emperor embraced him!
The Prince has crossed the Inner Court.
The slaves have sighted him
At every step, he is being showered
with flowers
He is firm in his step,
as he walks in here
The Emperor has granted permission
to the Prince to enter alone
The Prince has arrived
O'joyous world!
Or, are my eyes swimming?
Bahar! Hold me!
After so many years!
I wonder how he will say Mother?
For me, a new sound!
That word will resound in my ears
and it will resonate in my heart
O'heart, miss not a beat!
Mother
Open your eyes, Mother.
Look at me. I am here
Salim, you've grown so big!
I was used to seeing you
when you were just knee-high
Bend down, Salim.
Kneel down
Great soldier, are you?
You bled my blood upon
this earth... callously?
Without as much as a thought
to what it'd do...
to your mother's heart
to see these scars?
Had you remembered your mother
in battle...
you would've heard my lullabies
through the clangor of swords...
and you'd be as secure as
you'd be in your mother's lap
But you never remembered me
Salim, my love!
Bahar, take him away from me!
The heart awaits a glance
The foot awaits a step
Who is it that hides from me?
Not hides. Is hidden, Your Highness.
- Why?
The sculptor's challenge.
When this candle is unveiled...
Shall it be irresistible?
Challenges are interesting, sometimes
He claims that at its feet,
soldiers shall lay down swords...
Emperors their crowns, and men will
carve out their hearts in oblation
The sculptor's claim is much too
arrogant for appreciation
I must see how vain art can be
The Mighty One would rather
that you didn't see it
Why?
- The court astrologer says...
it augurs ill for the Prince to set
his eyes on any sculpture...
before the moon has set tonight.
The unveiling may be done tomorrow
In the presence of The Mighty One.
- The sculptor's challenge...
the astrologer's warning...
and this veiled sculpture
How can I wait till daybreak?
The sculptor's claim is correct
Only on stone can be etched
so stark a beauty
I must bow before such creativity
The Prince may be accused of idolatry.
- And lauded for appreciation of art
Nadira, the sculpture isn't ready yet.
You must pose for it tomorrow again
The Prince has seen me.
He has expressed his appreciation
There is an ardour veiled
in that appreciation
Ardour? Of whom?
- You
Attention
The Emperor cometh
Your slave wishes
to present a proposition
You may
Stories are told of statues
unveiled using the arrow
Interesting proposition
Prince, may stories be made
to come true?
As You command, Your Majesty
Great!
An angel from the heavens
cast in marble
Not an angel. Human
Who has made you pose
for the statue?
One of Your sculptors.
He was persistent
But he wishes anonymity
His strange sense of the arts
is surely laudable
But that arrow was aimed at you.
How come you stood still?
I wanted to see how stories
are made to come true
Well spoken, and I laud
your courage
Empress, you may take her in
as your handmaiden
I name her Anarkali
Tomorrow, we celebrate
the birth of Lord Krishna
She will dance
My word
Krishna teased me on the
banks of the Jamuna...
Krishna teased me on
the banks of Jamuna...
He twisted my delicate wrists
Krishna teased me on
the banks of the Jamuna
He cast a pebble at me,
and broke my pitcher
He broke my pitcher...
He left me drenched
Krishna teased me
on the riverbanks...
With his eyes, he cast a spell;
he won my heart
He won my heart
With his eyes, he cast a spell;
he won my heart
He won my heart...
My veil he pierced
with a mere look
On the riverbanks,
Krishna teased me
What is it, Suraiya?
- Someone is in love
You are.
- You're insane
Who am I in love with?
- With the one who's in love with you
Allah! Who is it?
The Prince!
- Hush!
Started making commands already?
When you become the Empress...
For God's sake, show me not dreams
that a slave dares not dream
He is the Crown Prince. The future
Emperor of Hindustan
So what? Allah makes Emperors of men,
but their Empresses can be anyone
You're naive. Can the earth
ever touch the skies?
Then, what do you want to be?
Just a slave.
- The Prince's slave
Not again! What if someone hears?
- This is love!
If not today, people will
come to know tomorrow
I know
Then why be afraid of
getting a bad name?
I'm not afraid of getting a bad name.
I don't want him to get a bad name
If this is what you believe,
you've had it!
Get up, come with me
Where?
- To him
His eyes are craving to see you
I cannot face anyone now.
Just let me hide in here
Go on, hide. I have the confidence
to go and face him
Have you lost your senses?
That is just what I have to ask
the Prince
One look at him, and people
lose their senses. Why?
To speak my heart before him
would amount to transgression
That'd be if neither had he
a wish in his heart
But in the state of ardour he's in,
will he have any sense of propriety?
What is the matter?
Why are you calling Suraiya?
Oh I'm so afraid, Mother!
Why are you here?
- I just came...
By whose permission?
- By let of my heart
Begone!
- I won't
Let her be, Durjan
What do you want?
- I wanted to see...
why people lose their senses
when they see you
Who says so?
- My sister. Nadira
She's out of her mind
ever since she saw you
Impertinence!
My name is Suraiya
Does your sister call you
by that name?
She used to.
- And now?
She has forgotten all else!
The only name on her lips is...
Prince
Give your sister
this message from me
This could be fraught with danger!
- Fall in love, and you will lose fear
What are you so completely lost in?
Letter
What letter?
- From the Prince
Allah!
If you pray to Allah,
you might get another letter
Take care, it's throbbing
Maybe, it's his heart
Take it
No
You lose no time in giving your heart
away. And you lose heart so easily?
I woke up to find Anarkali
in my soul
And I was in love
Do you know?
A sadness hangs heavy
on my restless heart
Day and night I think
of you and my desire
Allah forbid!
He loves me!
Sleepless nights I wake for you
Waiting by the canal
Send me a flower
Send me a reply
Let it float down the waters
Forget you, I cannot
Pray, send me a reply
A refusal?
Reason?
Because she's a slave girl.
And unfortunately, I'm a Prince
And places may not be traded
But I am human. That too is true
Have you been waiting for me
to cross the limits?
Your Highness, in our happiness,
we reach out for the stars
But do the stars ever
come down to earth?
For I have desired
For God's sake, do not
denigrate your status!
You are my master
I... am your slave
This wall that separates you and me,
I want to pull down
Sit down, Anarkali
Your Majesty...
Anarkali, look at me
I wish to see the desire
in your eyes
No, not my eyes
For I have nothing but
the fearful emotions of a slave girl
Then forget that you are a slave.
And in your eyes...
let Salim see for himself
that which you fear to voice
Do not take away from me, my dreams
It'd kill me!
I'll make these dreams come true
Your Majesty...!
- Let them see
Taunts I can live with;
not your dishonour
Give me an indication Lord
...what is to become now?
What does this couplet mean?
My heart is slipping
out of my hands
Oh, let not my agony
poison the lives of everyone
God knows what's come over you.
Don't you even feel Ionely?
And he's always asking about you.
Get up and come with me
No, I am afraid...
lest my eyes give away...
the secrets in my heart
Nadira, why have you been
so depressed of late?
If you stop socialising, people will
accuse you of having become vain...
ever since you were named Anarkali
by The Emperor
Allah! Would someone so helpless
be vain?
Can you stop tongues from wagging?
Little do you know palace intrigue
Welcome Bahar
You should take her under your wing.
- You mustn't worry
I have come to take her with me.
- Take good care of her
Anarkali... your new name
is so beautiful
Indeed
As of pretty candles that feed
their wax to the flames
Then why fear the firefly?
Fireflies...?
Like me
Maybe you could join me
during my performances?
Performance...?
Tonight. It's a recitation contest
Wouldn't it be nice if you were
to take a part of the stage?
And the other...?
- Me
And...
- Which of us wins...
is left to the Prince's discretion
In your court,
I will try my destiny
For a few moments, I will see
what it means to be close to you
In your court...
I will try my destiny too
At your feet,
I will lay my head
Spring comes bearing
the news of love
After ages, I see hope
After ages, I see hope
I will save myself
from the agony...
What fun is a life
bereft of any grief?
What fun in shedding tears,
without any grief?
I will shed tears in love
In your court,
I will try my destiny too
This is what happens
to those who fall in love
They suffer in silence...
and die a miserable death
I will see this farce
and amuse myself
In your court,
I will try my destiny too
Love, I concede,
ruins your life
But isn't it enough that you are
remembered long after you are dead?
I will ruin myself
for my love
At your feet,
I will lay my head
A few moments, I will
spend with you
In your court,
I will try my destiny too
To love in secret, to die for love
...the lover's dream
I shall watch it with a smile
come the day
Like this flower
And you Anarkali, would rather
be in love and be ruined
For what more can one ask for
but remembrance, after one is gone
What you get is the thorn
I am fortunate
Thorns live not in fear of wilting
What is it, Man Singh?
Documents relating to Ajmer province.
At the disposal of The Mighty One
At my disposal?
- Yes
Does Man Singh not know that
I have given away the province?
I know, Your Majesty.
- Then why the documents?
I am forced to draw Your attention.
Unless the mandate is issued...
the province might rise in revolt.
- So it has gone this far?
Have you not apprised the Prince
of his responsibility?
They were presented to the Prince
on several occasions. But...
What is it, Man Singh?
- But the reason for his reluctance...
I have failed to fathom.
- Then I shall!
Durjan, you will carry my word
to the governor of Ajmer
The works are to commence immediately.
Tell him that I wish...
to be apprised of the reason
for this negligence
I'll tell her that.
- And also tell her...
that without her, Salim's life
is as dark as the night
And...?
- Also that in the wait...
Salim is sinking into oblivion.
- And...?
That...
And The Emperor has decreed that
the works be commenced immediately
Do you bear animosity towards love?
- I bear you goodwill, Your Highness
If you bear goodwill towards others,
you might receive letters too
Silence!
- I'm Suraiya. You are too forgetful
Sire, I have seen anger
in The Emperor's eyes
Unless you stop this dangerous game,
the rumours will begin
Sister...
What's wrong with you, Suraiya?
- Why don't you look at me?
Why don't you ask me where I've been?
- You know it. Your sister is lost
Then stay lost. I don't have the time
for running errands for people.
Goodbye
Wait!
Did you meet him?
- Yes, I did
What was he saying?
- Lost? And yet so mindful?
Get lost. I won't tell you.
- If you don't, you're my pallbearer
I met the Prince in the garden.
- And then?
Looked like he hadn't slept all night.
He smiled. Then he asked me...
how is your sister?
- And then?
Then he holds my hands
and he asks...
Say Suraiya, she must be
as ill as I am...?
What did you say?
I said it!
Then he stepped forward
and he kissed my forehead
And then what happened?
- He said, tell your sister that...
tonight when Tansen sings,
ask her to come to see me
A blush? After that kiss?
Is it because he kissed me there too?
- Oh! I forgot
Such a delightful mistake!
But he kissed my forehead twice
Someone must be watching!
The intruder shall see me
in my chamber
At your command
I rue my fate that the dagger
failed to find its mark
Your Highness, do give the dagger
one more chance
There is much blood that
flows through my bosom
What carries the flame?
- Silenced tales of a night past
And some secrets
Which is why, it will be put out
as soon as the day breaks
Your Highness!
A secret you too have tried
to unravel
And thus shall you be silenced
You may leave
Anarkali (pomegranate blossoms)
The trees in the garden are flowering
Maybe Your Majesty has not noticed
Yes, I have not seen Anarkali
in a long while
Her plaintive voice may soothe
my laboured mind
Summon her
She cannot. Not at this time.
- Reason?
Anarkali shall sit beside Salim
as the Empress of Hindustan
Let not the dust at your feet
rise to touch your crown
It is done. I can see it
Akbar's Hindustan you shall inherit.
- For God's sake!
The fate of the people of Hindustan
you shall decide
Wherever you look, a thousand souls
will stand in awe
And your mercy they shall seek
The Emperor!
No! You must not commit such trespass
before The Emperor! Let me go!
The Emperor cometh
If His Majesty sees me here,
Anarkali dies in your arms!
Untrue to love you are, if you live
in fear. It's debauchery, it's sin
Out of the way!
- I won't!
Where is he?
Who?
- Emperor Akbar, at whose command...
life that Allah giveth is snubbed out!
- You shall speak in courtesy, Salim
It is not Salim's Anarkali who may
suffer death in a despot's dungeon!
I will have his seal
on this order of acquittal
Anarkali may not be set free
Why not?
Silence! The Crown Prince may not
be oblivious of his duty
What duty calls for stifling
the love in one's heart?
To do The Emperor's bidding
is your duty
This is no duty! But it surely is
punishment of being born of an Emperor
Then this noblesse oblige
you shall have to suffer
Then imprison her not, and grant
the same to that innocent Anarkali
You've no right to direct my decision.
- But over my own life, I have a right
If Anarkali be not acquitted, then
tonight augurs dear not for Anarkali...
but for Emperor Akbar and his dreams
I weep for the falsehood of love
I weep for the falsehood of love
I am hurt, I weep
I weep for the falsehood of love
I gave it not another thought...
my desire for you
has led to my downfall
I weep for the patronage
you extended
I weep for the lies
about love
I am hurt, I weep
How was I to know
what it would lead to?
That I'd have to hide my love,
and yet lead my life
I live, but I weep
at my life
I cry for those falsehoods
of love
I am hurt, I cry
I cry for those falsehoods
of love
Orders. Anarkali is to be produced
in court
Surely the darkness of the dungeons
has dashed your splendid dreams?
The darkness was far less than the
light I carry in my heart dispels
You may suffer worse darkness
And resolve may harden
Resolve may be crushed
The Emperor's justice?
I wish to hear no more
Akbar's word is the law
You must forget Salim
Forget Salim?
- Beyond doubt
Not only that. You must convince him
that you were never in love with him
I could bring not my tongue to speak
of my love to him. How can I refute?
You will have to prove...
that your love was untrue
A slave dreamt of becoming
the Empress of Hindustan
And in love she found a pretty alibi.
- This is not true!
Allah knows! This is not true!
Not true!
What you have to prove is that
this is the truth
Lord!
Grant me such courage...
that I may even betray the Prince
Your slave shall try to obey
your command
Not try
You shall abide
Set her free
No one has ever known Emperor Akbar
to renege on His verdict
Anarkali's acquittal is a defeat
for The Emperor
Not defeat. It's proof that
at heart, The Emperor is humane
For the first time, I think of myself
not merely as the Crown Prince...
but also as the son of a father
who is humane
In Anarkali's acquittal, He has
conferred a privilege...
to the woman I love.
- Not love, Your Highness
A privilege for deceit
Deceit? Whose?
Ask it of these chains
I ask you
Fragile as she is, your Anarkali could
not bear the weight of these chains
She has traded her chains
for golden cuffs
What proof?
Anarkali's rewards include
a fiefdom
Tonight, she performs in court.
After which...
she has agreed to disappear.
Forever
The Prince is coming
Leave me alone
You shall stay here
So at last the wax doll melts?
And burns to ashes that
false garb of love...
which you wore when you strutted
before my eyes?
Anarkali! The one whom just a dark
night in the dungeons has consumed
You treacherous slave!
Anarkali you are not!
You're a pretender who is masquerading
as Anarkali to get out of prison!
You are not my Anarkali!
- Yes, I am not your Anarkali
Certainly not! You are Akbar's whore!
Not Salim's lover
You were just an illusion
I took heart to
You're a shameful blot on my name.
To be washed away!
Attention all ye
The Empress of the world
The jewel of the throne
of Hindustan
Maharani Jodhabai
The one we are proud of
His Highness, the Crown Prince
of the Sultanate
Prince Noor-ud-din Mohammad Salim
Attention! Heed the Badshah
Plenipotentiary of Allah
The Emperor of Emperors, The One
of whom the world seeks succour
Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar
cometh
It is but once that man
falls in love with another
In anguish, he lives...
in anguish, he dies
When we have loved...
why should we fear?
We have loved...
not committed a theft
We have only loved
We have loved...
not committed a theft
Why should we be afraid?
We have loved...
why should we fear?
I'll reveal today the secrets
that lie in my heart...
I'll reveal today the secrets
that lie in my heart
Death is what the
world witnesses...
what good is dying a death
of sufferance like this?
We have loved...
why should we fear?
In desire of him...
I shall burn
For love, I shall live.
For love, I shall die
Nothing more is my will
Now that I am in love,
why must I fear?
Our love will not remain hidden
Everywhere around us
are tales of our love
There is nothing that
separates us from God...
why should we create barriers
between humans?
We have loved...
why should we fear?
We have loved,
not committed a theft
Why should we fear?
This fearlessness in love,
this audacity...
this novel manner of
making your statement...
indeed, all this deserves
to be rewarded
My good fortune
Of the magnanimous Plenipotentiary
of Allah, such I have expected
Master of the Dungeons
Take this girl away
Cast her in the
darkest dungeon
Leave me alone
Your continued presence
is proof of your disobedience
Anarkali was arrested... I watched on.
- What else could you have done?
What can anyone do before
so mighty an emperor?
But today, Allah's Plenipotentiary
must own up to vindictiveness
And my aspirations must be respected.
- If a slave is what you aspire for...
then you shall be denied.
All your life
Did you beget me that You may
rule the life that is mine?
That while I breathe, You hold
my heart hostage?
Am I to be indebted to You for my
life? Am I to pay my debt in tears?
Anarkali is unfit for you
Why not?
Embrace me as a father
would his loved son
Behold me with love in Your eyes
as You did when You saw me first
Not as the Crown Prince of Hindustan,
think of me as your son...
and tell me, is Anarkali unfit for me?
- Father I am, of a loved son
But my duty as Emperor
I cannot disregard
For no sake of my son's romances,
may I play with the fate of my empire
It all changes. With time
Empires change. Emperors change
But in this world of changes,
one who has found love wavers not
Change, you will have to!
Salim! You will have to change
A father who wants kings and sultans
to bow before his heir...
an Emperor who wants his Crown Prince
to crush kingdoms...
that is the father who has seen
his heir...
that is the emperor who has seen
his Crown Prince...
bow before a slave's beauty. It was
as if thunder had struck his hopes
The shock has shaken the very seat
of the Mughal empire
Desist, till He has
regained composure
Desist I, whose life has been ruined,
and desist not he, who thinks...
his fancied regency has been marred?
- That is not the case
No! The Mighty One wants to play God!
He wants to dictate emotions!
Who cares of consent
to fall in love?
Your Highness! Save my Nadira!
Please save my Nadira!
My Nadira! Please save her!
My little girl! She will beat her head
upon the dungeon walls till she dies!
If this is the way she has to die,
Hindustan is the empire no more!
Hindustan will become the graveyard
for the Mughal Sultanate
If the doors open not, then the walls
of the dungeon will have to fall
Not the sword. You need a key to open
fortified doors
Bahar...!
- I have dared
Come on
Where to?
- Far away from Akbar's empire
The arrogance mounts!
Salim is to be held
Subtitle by PmT
Will you confront The Emperor
for the sake of a slave girl?
No! I see in her the pride of Mughals.
The Empress of Hindustan
Never! The pride of the Mughals may
never be equated to a slave girl
And Hindustan is not your heart
for a slave girl to Lord over it
Nor is my heart your Hindustan
to rule over
Over your heart, I have no right.
But over you, I do have my rights
After all, you are my son.
- Yes, your son I am
But you too should consider
that I am part of your body
Not some slave
No Salim, no!
You were given to me in answer
to my years of prayer
You are my life's treasure.
You are my beloved
But this is a matter of the state.
Do not drag your mother into this
Do not force me to forget my duty
because of my love for you
Have respect for my responsibilities
and for your duty too
To Hindustan, you are the Moon!
Do nothing to denigrate yourself
Cast Anarkali out of your heart
For the sake of my milk I fed you!
- A price for my mother's milk?
No Salim!
Or would you rather...
that I bathe your feet in your milk
that runs in my veins as blood?
But ask not for usury
You do not even understand
the import of what you speak!
I understand. I seek not one piece
of your precious Hindustan
But give me Anarkali.
I beg of you
Of Maharani Jodha I seek compassion.
Of Emperor Akbar, I seek mercy
Salim! Tears? Those tears are
Jodha's and Akbar's life!
Spill not tears from your eyes.
Hold your tears
Anarkali, you will have
Never
No heir to Emperor Babar's throne
may be disgraced
I decree Salim be sent on
the campaign of Deccan
No sad lover, but a soldier be given
the sword to carry in battle
Do not endanger the Prince's life.
- Death in the battlefield...
is better than life lived in
desperate love of a slave girl
Wait
My Salim will not go to war
My decree shall not be swayed
by a mother's blind love
But Salim will decide
If You wish to see how an Emperor's
decree may be rebuffed...
then give Salim Your dictat
Such scant respect he has for me?
- Do not gauge him by his disposition
Let this storm blow over.
Salim will change. You'll see
And how to make the storm blow over?
- Let him have Anarkali
Once he has Anarkali,
Salim will return to us
The obligation of a slave girl
to turn my own son around?
For the sake of your son!
- A mother can be only a mother
And you are an emperor.
Only an emperor
Beyond doubt
Man Singh, so shall it be done
This royal charter decrees...
that the Crown Prince...
Noor ud din Mohammad Salim...
at daybreak tomorrow,
leaves the royal palace
and marches for Deccan
with the army
Take it away! I am no heir
to Emperor Akbar!
Your Highness!
Wait or us at Safdarjung Gate
Your Highness, was that not naive?
- Maybe. But I insist
If I be coerced, then I shall
refuse to obey
You may not act in naivete.
This is no time for being adamant
He is the one who is being adamant.
My wounds need to be salved. He knows
And yet he decrees my departure!
If he thinks he can coerce me...
he is wrong!
- The Emperor will not tolerate...
the Prince's disobedience. The stance
may be the excuse for Anarkali's death
This, he cannot do!
- This is exactly what he will do
Life for Anarkali lies beyond
the bloodbath and the victory
Lead your army
If Anarkali's life be cause for war...
then I shall turn the tide
even in the face of death!
But who takes responsibility
for Anarkali's safety in my absence?
I do. She lives safe
in the shadow of my sword
Durjan, you have but one sword.
Emperor Akbar wields a million swords
Then you have a Rajput's word.
A million heads will roll
Your Majesty, the sculptor is here
Leave us alone
Sculptor, I am glad that artistes
of your prowess thrive in my empire
But the truth is that
I face starvation
Not any more
In appreciation of your art
I reward you
In appreciation of the art,
this is far too much
But in appreciation of truth,
this is far too little
What do you seek?
- To spread the truth...
about my art throughout the empire.
- You have my permission
My good fortune. My unfinished agenda
shall now be completed...
thanks to The Emperor's magnanimity
No, all is not done yet
What you lack in life
is a woman
As your reward, I give you
the very beauty...
whom you have used to express
the beauty of your art
Meaning...?
Tomorrow, you shall wed Anarkali
But Your Majesty...
Is this5s any less a reward?
- It is beyond my expectations
I am beholden to The Emperor
You may leave
Such little difference between cruelty
and justice that Emperors dispense!
For the bounty that The Emperor
bestows upon you...
is this how happy you are?
- Happiness is a fool's emotion
I am just joking about the foolishness
of the bequeathal
Do you refuse the reward?
Do you refuse to obey The Emperor?
Indeed!
The consequences... do you realise?
The truth of my sculpture
may yet be borne in my blood
The spirit you have shown in refusing
to obey Emperor Akbar, I salute
That salutation is no reward
for my spirit
Then, what is it you desire?
I wish to see Anarkali's fate
enjoined with yours
A message to The Emperor
from the Crown Prince
Read it out
The Emperor of Hindustan,
Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar...
be apprised that I, Crown Prince
Noor ud din Mohammad Salim...
hereby declare my independence.
I enjoin upon The Emperor...
to accept Anarkali as my consort,
the future Empress of Hindustan
The Emperor also be apprised that
I am a prince of the dynasty of Tamer
A dynasty of regents who, without
recourse to dictat or religion...
chose their consorts. I too reserve
the right to choose one of my liking
And this right I am exercising.
Should The Emperor disagree...
This is a documentation of the vanity
of youth. Read it to the last
I cannot move myself to speak.
- The veil of courtesy is lifted
Read on
Read on!
Should The Emperor disagree,
then the revolt has begun
The rebellion of this upstart
I shall take on
Let the historians add a love-crazed
fool to the list of my rebels
Man Singh, we shall fight
I shall ride in battle
Has the Maharani forgotten that she
has to say sacrament to my sword?
Your Majesty, the Empress
expresses her inability...
to hand over to you the sword
that will slay the Prince
Tradition may not be changed.
From her only, shall I accept my sword
Always from your hands I have taken
the sword...
that has decapitated my rebels
Today too, you shall perform
this ritual
You ask me to give you the sword
that will kill my son?
Not your son
I seek the sword against the rebel
who threatens to kill your husband
Will you not give me the sword
to protect myself, for my victory?
I stand not to win.
Either way, I lose
On one hand, my husband.
On the other, my son
And the choice you shall make
right now
Your son, or your husband?
As a Rajput, you epitomise the legacy
of women who immolated themselves...
upon the pyres of their dead husbands.
Do you hesitate?
You were born a daughter of warriors!
Why are your hands shaking?
No hands of one who heartens
not to her husband...
can carry the sword of emperors
O'Mighty One!
The mark of the wedded woman that
you have wiped from my brow...
you will give back to me
with the red of Salim's blood
If the price of my husband's life
has to be paid for in my son's blood...
then take this sword, and
be happy to kill my son!
Not a word shall I utter!
The call for battle is
the cry for his death
Whose death, Your Majesty?
The one so blinded by foolish love,
as not to know his father!
This darkness must be dispelled
This pretty serpent that sways between
me and Salim, must be fanged
I make an appeal...
my world lies shattered
Show mercy to me, O Lord
Mired in difficulties is life
Have mercy on me, Lord
I need help, Lord...
Come to my rescue
I keep no secrets from You
I'm wounded at heart
Have mercy on me, Lord
Dark clouds hover...
there isn't a silver lining
Save me from drowning...
I'm surrounded by storms,
life is difficult
Have mercy on me, Lord
I'm plagued with adversity
Have mercy on me, Lord
Open the cell.
I have come to take Anarkali
Except death, to none else may we
deliver her. The Emperor's orders
And I have to take her out alive.
A Rajput has given his word
The army is ready and awaiting
The Emperor's arrival
May Allah lead you to victory
May the Regent who loves His subjects,
His Motherland and God...
be victorious always
O'Emperor of Emperors, Thou hast
bestowed upon this humble man...
every blessing that
life has to offer
I have heard people call me
their emperor
Now, please let me hear
the word father
Are these the hands that prayed?
Man Singh, before the battle commences,
I shall go to meet Salim
With all due deference
to Your decision...
it is not advisable for The Emperor
to enter the rebel's camp alone
But for a father it is possible
Emperor Akbar cometh
Leave us alone
Has The Emperor come
to pardon the rebel?
This unfortunate father that
the world calls an emperor...
has come to talk to his talk to
his son... to ask for his love
You destroy your son's love,
and yet you seek his love?
Now the emperor poses
as a father?
The Emperor never weeps
These are tears in a father's eyes
Son, before Akbar's principles,
your poor father is helpless
Then to Salim too, his love
Son...
Son, love can win hearts.
Not battles
Your emotions cannot withstand
the relentless onslaught...
of an Emperor's endless might.
- That the battle will decide
The Emperor cares not for war
to influence his decision
At the sounding
of the wardrums...
Anarkali dies
My son...!
So this is the day I begot you for?
If the father's head should roll
to please the son...
here stands a father
Your Highness
Has the might of the Emperor overcome
a Rajput's promise?
No, Your Highness.
A Rajput will give up his life
Not his promise
Anarkali...?
Salim has won without war
There will be no war
- There will be war!
My prayers go with you
On the battlefield, may Allah
protect you from Akbar's wrath
Anarkali...
That you still live,
bodes ill for Salim
Before the swords of Akbar cast
the shadow of death over your heads...
before the storm of blood and ash
consumes you...
hand Anarkali over
This sword has vanquished
the mightiest of warriors...
protects not only Anarkali,
but all men who have loved...
all those who refuse to be
servile to emperors
Man Singh! Battle begins!
Charge!
Charge!
Kill Anarkali on this very field
Your Highness, Anarkali's life
is in danger
With your permission,
may I escort her to safety?
The victorious Emperor returns
from the battlefield...
to visit Maharani Jodhabai
Is this the mark of the married woman,
or is this a mother's woe?
Look at my sword
Not a drop of Salim's blood
This must be the first sword
that a mother has embraced!
Take me to Salim
You may not meet him
Why?
His father's sword
may have spared him.
But there's more to
The Emperor's justice
Accused. Noor ud din Mohammad Salim,
son of Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar...
be presented before the tribunal
for sentencing
Attention all ye
The proceedings may begin
Against Noor ud din Mohammad Salim,
the accusation lies...
that for the sake of a slave girl,
you have brought the Crown to disgrace
You have undermined
The Emperor's decree
You have incited a mutiny
You have lured a trustworthy Rajput
like Durjan Singh into treachery
You have abducted Anarkali
You have incited a rebellion
in the Emperor's armies
You have revolted
All these charges
can be retracted
All your transgressions
may be pardoned
I can bestow upon you all privileges
as before
Provided you return Anarkali.
- For You to execute her?
Beyond doubt
Then in all equity,
The Emperor shall do so too...
to those disobedient fireflies that
fling themselves into the candles...
and the bees that sing so sweetly
of love as they fly over flowers...
and stop the rivers for they lose
themselves in the embrace of seas
I wish not to hear depositions
on love inspired by madness
I want Anarkali
And I do not want
to give Anarkali away
Then I swear by the blood of Tamer
that runs in my veins...
you will be disowned forever
That I shall accept
But not the throne that sits upon
Anarkali's grave
Not the crown that holds
my heart hostage
That is unacceptable.
- Now I know!
In the fires of your love you wish to
melt down the gold in the Mughal crown
To craft of it anklets to adorn
the feet of a dancing girl
Upon the sacred throne of Hindustan
you wish to see a pretty whore dance
And you...
And you wish to bring your future
daughter-in-law to disgrace in court!
Silence!
Try as much as The Emperor will, to
veil vendetta for defeat with justice
Anarkali He shall not have!
His son's life, He may have
Justice I hold dearer
than my son
Noor ud din Mohammad Salim, you have
taken advantage of my magnanimity
And you have refused to present
Anarkali in court
Anarkali's sentence
is not revoked
In her stead, you...
are sentenced to death
Mercy!
Seek not my sympathy today
What but death can a despot decree?
In the tale of Anarkali's love
etched in Salim's blood...
the demise of Akbar, The Emperor
will also be told
Leave me alone
What news?
Emperor Akbar has decreed that
tomorrow morning...
Prince Salim will die
in Anarkali's stead
Till Durjan can wield the sword,
death cannot touch the Prince!
Where are you going?
- To face Emperor Akbar!
You are wounded.
- My body is wounded
Not my spirit!
Out of my way!
Do you see fear on your son's face?
Not a shadow
You are my blood.
I have faith
I have come to congratulate my son
The brave Rajput is also
wedded to death
How I wish all mothers had hearts
like Maharani Jodha
Today is the day when Emperor Akbar
was defeated, and love triumphed
To you I express my gratitude...
and my respects to the mothers
of the martyrs who bore death...
for the sake of truth and love
This is my final message
Stand fast by those in love,
not by those who be mighty
Long live the Prince!
On the path of love...
a lover triumphs
Rejoice. Love is martyred
Victory be to love
Victory be to love
Free from slavery to riches,
love triumphs
Long live, love
In mosques and temples...
Iove is faith
Flowing from Krishna's flute,
love is what Allah blesses
Love keeps the world alive
Long live, love
Hatred shall not contain
this storm of love
Love shall not be slain
by daggers and swords
Lovers are martyred...
they are remembered forever
Long live, love
Should love revolt,
it could change the world
A raging fire it could
cause in mighty palaces...
and overthrow emperors
With their heads held high,
they seek no favours
Long live, love
Long live, love
Those who worship power
have no faith of their calling
He who worships power
has no faith of his calling
A heart bereft of love
is made of stone
He whose heart is bereft of love,
is not human
Come to your senses,
O enemy of love...
lest you are doomed
Long live, love
Long live, love
Long live Man Singh!
Should The Emperor so desire,
the Prince may be released
After Anarkali's death
He is alive. He lives
Your Majesty!
The Prince is alive!
My felicitations to The Emperor!
You will die
Take this pretty petrel away!
Bury her alive
The word of The Emperor be blessed.
May my Prince live forever!
That is all I wish for...
all I wish for
Anarkali, the dying is given
one last wish
If you have any wish,
you may petition The Emperor
It is beyond The Emperor
to give me my wish
I am not so narrow-minded as not to
allow the last wish of a slave girl
Speak
Before I die, I wish
to become the empress
At last! You have spoken
what you had in heart
Even in the shadow of death
you have not forgotten...
that golden dream of becoming
the Empress of Hindustan
I am a slave. Do not presume
that it's my wish, Your Majesty
The Prince promised...
to make me his queen
I do not want him to break
his promise
A future Emperor of Hindustan must not
be ashamed of failing a slave girl
I shall not let the future
Emperor of Hindustan to be ashamed
Man Singh, Salim is to be set free
Before daybreak, you will make sure
that Salim inhales...
this flower doused with intoxicants.
He must not interfere with your death
He must pass out before the sentries
draw you away from him...
and send you to your death
Death is closer than love
So it shall be done
Unless this is done,
Salim will not let you die
And I shall not let you live,
Anarkali
I died a long time ago
Now please let the coffin pass
into my grave
You may go
In return for this
act of magnanimity...
this slave absolves you,
Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar...
of the crime of my murder
How will the heartburn ever lessen?
How will love ever lessen?
The night is colourful...
what will day be like?
Every couplet sparkles;
goblets of joy are drunk
This Spring will be spoken about
for ages to come
How much more enchanting
could love be?
Such is this colourful night...
what will tomorrow be like?
The mood around here,
with the lovers present
Their eyes convey love...
their hearts brim with passion
For a few moments
spent like this...
why would they even
regret death?
Such is the colourful night...
what will day be like?
Such is the state
of these lovers...
those issuing edicts
aren't going to be spared
Why would they contemplate
the consequences...
given the state they are in
A passionate night is in the offing;
what is it going to be like
Such is this colourful night...
what will day be like?
Why have you done this?
These pretty hands have
at last let go of love?
How could you betray me
like this?
Do not turn away from Salim, Anarkali.
Come to me
Tell me, can you betray me?
Tell me, can you?
No!
Anarkali can betray her on life
Not you
Life...?
Who is it?
Who wants to kill you?
No one
Is this why I have been intoxicated?
So that you may be taken away from me?
Destiny decrees so
Destiny shall change her decree
Anarkali, I can see
those crawling shadows
The cowardly slaves
of Emperor Akbar...
they are coming for you!
I can see them!
Come out!
Anarkali is mine!
No one takes her away from me!
These heartless knaves...
cannot touch you, Anarkali!
My love, come...
You knaves!
Knaves!
Anarkali...
Salim loves you!
Comes dawn, bearing death...
like someone snuffing out life
May God be your Saviour
May God be your Protector
This is my prayer
Your world, I leave
Accept my farewell
When they take away
my bier soon...
do not be one of those
who carry it
When they take away
my bier soon...
do not lend it a shoulder
May our love never be disgraced
This is what I pray for
This is what I tearfully pray for
May God be your Saviour
This is all I pray for
My child!
Nadira...!
By the sacred scales of Justice,
I swear
Whatever you seek of Akbar,
for once in your life...
shall be given
The Emperor!
The Emperor!
Where is The Emperor?
What do you want?
Life. For my daughter
Has hope blinded you?
Do you not know my law?
Do you recognise this,
Your Majesty? Remember...?
You promised me that
I may have one wish
I seek Anarkali's life
I remember nothing.
- You remember nothing?
But The Emperor never reneges
on his promise
I told you! I remember nothing!
You may forget your promise
But that Emperor of emperors
who has made you an emperor...
He shall never forget!
On the day of judgement,
you shall be accused
And I shall have justice!
Take her away!
My child! Emperor, my child!
Seek what you will
The Emperor has reneged on his
promise. What else is there to seek?
Look
My child!
Your Majesty, I am grateful!
Listen...
This tunnel will take you past
the border of the Mughal empire
That Anarkali is alive is a secret.
You will have to keep it a secret
Salim must know that
his Anarkali is dead
So it shall be
The Emperor has done justice
by letting her live
Anarkali, pay your obeisances
Till such time that this world is,
you will live as love lives
And the Mughals will remember
this favour you have done
Unto the dynasty of Babur and Humayun,
you have granted a fresh lease of life
But I...
I can offer you nothing
but a life of anonymity
I am helpless
By God, I am no enemy of love
But of my principles
I am a slave
Consider the helplessness
of the slave...
and you might yet forgive me
Anarkali, The Emperor
has expressed his gratitude!
Take her away
Emperor Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar
pardoned Anarkali
He took the blame for being
cruel and merciless
I stand testimony of the justice
of this ruler...
the one whom the world remembers as
Mughal-e-Azam
