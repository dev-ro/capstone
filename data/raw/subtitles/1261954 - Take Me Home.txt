Actually sir,
if you could just take a look now...
...I really appreciate it.
There is... There is issue
with my landlord...
...he is kinda on my back.
So, if you could just...
please, please.
Thank you.
Not bad,
nice work, good job.
Thanks for coming in.
That's it?
You got no studio work.
All we do is studio work...
...food, fashion,
celebrity portrait.
- I got celeb.
- Who?
I actually just shot
Frank Stalone for this.
- He is the brother of...
- I know who he is.
It's out of order.
Look,
we sell seks.
You got no seks in there.
You see that,
we shot that.
I had sex with that.
You're a photojournalist.
You take
pretty pictures of...
...trees and buildings
and homless people.
- Stick with that.
- If you could just...
I don't have studio work...
...because
I can't afford it.
I can't afford it,
because I don't have jobs...
...that pay
like studio work.
See? So...
...I really feel like
I can be great at this.
I just...
I need someone
to take a chance.
Good luck with that.
I love it.
It is not
what it seems. It is like...
We can do our
work here.
We can talk about
business and...
Hey hon.
This is my... Candy.
This is Candy.
You are not at work.
I'm not at work.
I'm right here.
Candy,
could you excuse us?
Yes, sure.
Oh, you mean...
Okey, now before
you get all in a huff...
...just hear me out, okey?
Candy is
a new manager's assistant...
...while Dawn's in Anaheim
I'm getting her acclimated.
To our home?
Yeah,
we were in neigboorhood, okey?
I left my laptop here.
- Eric!
- What?
Don't power lunch me, Eric!
Okay, what do you wanna hear?
- The truth!
- The truth?
That you rather spent time
filling things in Candy's drawers...
...than be home with your wife.
You work
just as much as I do, okey?
It's like
a sicence project, isn't it Eric?
Oh, no, no,no, not right now,
not the big picture's speech.
Working on us.
It's like the bathroom walls
we never get around repainting.
What are we doing here?
Can I say something?
Actually really like
the paint of the bathroom.
I can't believe this.
I truelly find this
unbelievable.
Did you ask me,
if I had the rent? No.
Instead you chucked
my things out into the hall way.
Do you have the rent?
That's not the point, Dave.
Okay, you know what,
I, I... I...
I am working tonight and
I'll bring you check tomorrow morning.
Do not work Thomas!
You're a fake cab driver...
...who drive people around
in a fake taxi cab.
That's on the side
but okey, you know what?
I was gonna tell you this
I got a job today.
A real job?
Yes, a real job and
it has a big fat pay check.
So why don't you help me
pick all this crap up and...
...put it right back
into that room, please.
Dave!
Sorry Thom,
I can't carry you anymore.
- Dave, Dave!
- No!
You gotta listen, please.
- No, I can't do that.
- Don't do this to me. Dave!
Dave!
Okay, bye.
Susana!
Did you send up the mailling list?
That's it, there.
Great, great,
Susana, thanks for staying.
- My pleasure.
- So you are done.
You heading home,
heading out?
- You need me to mail those?
- No, no.
You've done
more than enough.
Okey then.
Hey, how's your boyfriend?
What's his name again?
- Chris?
- Chris.
Ow, ow,
We broke up.
Oh you did,
I am sorry.
Oh, it's okay,
we never really fit anyway.
Yeah?
I mean,
we tried to make it work...
...but he always wanted me
to be somebody I am not.
You know?
Totally.
Correcting my grammar,
buying me clothes I did not like...
...puting a pillowcase
over my head...
...and bending me
over the furniture.
I just...
I never got used to it.
But live and learn, good guy
just not the one for me.
Yes.
Are you sure
don't want me to mail those?
No, no I'll get it.
Thank you.
Okay.
Claire,
where the hell are you?
I hope you get this.
I called at your home but
for some reason your machine didn't pick up.
So I am calling you here.
This is your mom by the way.
I should not be leaving
a message like this...
...but it's about your dad.
His daughter Eve called
and he is...
He went and
had a heart attack.
He is okey, you know...
...well I guess
he is not okey...
...he had a
goddamn heart attack.
But he ain't dead.
So I was thinking...
...I got the number of
the hospital he is at in California...
...on the off chance that
you might wanna call him.
- Where to?
- Drive!
- What?
- Just drive.
Are you...
If you go on past Newark
I gotta charge round trip.
I don't make the rules.
That's... That's headquarters.
We can't go past
New Brunswick either.
That's...
That's corporation limit.
In fact, even
New Brunswick's pushing it.
Will you shut up?
I'm not paying you to talk,
I'm paying you to drive.
That's why
I took a cab.
So, I could sit in the back...
...while some foreigner
who speaks broken English...
...could take me
where I need to go!
I do not know
where you need to go.
I do not care where...
...I do not care where
I don't care how much it cost.
I'll just pay you
whatever it cost.
Because I don't care.
Do you get it?
I don't care.
I don't care.
Do you care?
Holly shit!
Good morning.
Holly shit!
Where are we?
Rodney.
- What?
- Rodney.
It's about one hour
outside the Pittsburgh.
- Pennsylvania?
- That would be the one.
We are in Pennsylvania!
- Are you joking?
- No.
- Why did you bring me here?
- You told me to.
To drive to Rodney?
"Just drive" that's
what you said, "just drive".
Ow, I get it.
You drive me
all the way out here...
...so you can drive me
all the way back...
...then you make
twice as much.
That's really clever.
Dan Reeves.
- Turn around.
- I can't.
You'll get your round trip,
now turn us around.
I can't drive the median.
That's is illegal.
I pay for the ticket,
just turn us around.
Six miles to the next exit,
you'll just have to wait.
Stop the car!
Okay.
Meter's running.
Can you wait in the car?
Here is your purse.
I got it.
I got it.
I am sorry.
We can work
something out, if you, um...
...you know,
If you don't have enough.
Anyway.
I am sorry.
You're a licence cabby?
Don't point that at me.
You have a good record, right?
You're a professional?
- Yes
- No accidents or tickets?
Non
- Honestly?
- Honestly.
I need an atlas.
Ready?
Looks like
we just stand 70.
70 west?
So where we head?
Encinitas.
Where is that?
In Pennsylvania?
Ohio?
California.
Oh God,
you are serious.
Yeah,
we're not doing that.
Why not?
Oh, I don't know, I got...
I got other things to do.
I got meetings,
I got deadlines...
I 'm not just
a taxi driver, you know.
I pay whatever
the meter says.
The meter would explode
trying to calculate a fair that big.
Then name your price.
We're talking about
alot of money.
Like buttloads.
Two thousand.
Two thousand,
get you to the Pittsburgh Airport...
...you can fly anywhere
in the continal United States.
I do not fly.
Three thousand.
Three thousand is,
carry the one, still not enough.
Four.
Five.
Done.
Six.
You said five.
Five, tonight.
A thousand at the end of each day.
Five days,
five thousand.
- Plus accommodation.
- Done.
- And food.
- Fine.
Fine.
So Encinitas, huh?
Dan is it?
Claire.
Ben burada ölüyorum.
It's this car.
It's depressing.
You should take
better care of it.
Yeah?
It's funny you'd mention that.
I was just about to get, uh,
cashmere upholstery in here, beautiful..
But then
I splurged on gasoline.
Well, I bet you spend
a lot of time in here.
Wouldn't be surprised...
...what a little TLC could do
to brighten your mood.
Yeah, I don't think
the cab's the problem here.
It wouldn't kill us
to get out every once in a while...
...you know,
stretch our legs...
...get a sense of where we are,
how far we've come.
That's
what road trips are for.
Otherwise,
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Utah...
...you know,
they're just names on a map.
Might as well be
on a plane looking down.
There.
Let's stop there.
Here we go.
Where it where?
Okay.
Can you back to trunk?
- Oh, well, let me...
- What's all this?
Some guy
drove last night left it.
- Can we get rid of it?
- No, no he...
...he asked me
hold onto it untill call about it.
Must be really lonely.
You ever notice how really
lonely men have huge DVD collections?
That's the point, I guess.
Ready?
Was it an accident?
What?
What happened
back in New York.
It's cool me.
It's cool me.
I'm just tellin you...
...I don't wanna get dragged
into something, you know as...
As what?
An accomplice.
Come on.
You're driving
cross country in a taxi cab.
Your method of payment
has to be your husband's check book.
And you don't want
your photo taken.
It is curious.
I killed my husband.
Look, I don't really feel very comfortable
telling you my life story.
He found out
about the afair.
What?
Your husband,
he found out about the...
...the bohunk living in Encinitas,
we're heading out to see.
I should have known.
I see it now.
Look, I am sure,
this is a lot of fun for you but...
...I don't feel comfortable
telling you my life story.
Than don't.
The less I know,
the better.
Are you gonna do this
the whole trip.
You're not gonna talk,
I am gonna fill in the gaps.
My father is in a hospital in Salinas,
he had a heart attack.
So, If you are not gonna stop talking
could you at least switch subjects?
Absolutely.
So.
You're married.
What's that like?
- It's great.
- Yeah?
I don't think I can do it.
I think it's unnatural.
Did you know that
out of all the mammals on earth...
...only a quarter of them
are monogamous.
The rest...
...sleeping around.
Doing it.
Many of which eat
their own poop.
I just think
we have unrealistic expectations.
Did you know that
marriage was orginally conceived...
...as an agreement
between families...
...for financial gain, security...
...and somewhere
along the line...
...this whole concept of love
got stirred in?
But they just don't mix.
Marriage ruins love,
love ruins marriage.
It's awful.
Take George
and Willma over there.
I bet they were insanely
happy once upon a time.
And then they got married!
Had kids,
went broke.
George was a wonderful plumber
but terrible accountant.
Wilma probably blamed him
and thought about leaving him...
...but decided to stick it out,
you know, for kids.
And now here they are
after all these years...
...with nothing to say.
Maybe they are enjoying it.
Sitting with someone
they really know.
Someone
who really knows them.
Not having to say
something with your insightful.
I like my version better.
Just a little bit.
it is a better story.
For someone
who has never married before...
...how did you get
to be such an expert.
You must come close
once or twice.
No!
I got a degree
in psychoanalysis, N.Y.U.
You're therapist?
And taxi driver?
Wow!
Driving is something
I do on the side.
You know, for fun.
Well, you might wanna
change your focus.
You're much better
taxi driver than you're therapist.
Hey! Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Oh God!
Wow,
that was...
The alignment
seems to be a little...
Stop the car!
- What?
- Stop the car.
Why?
You just drove
across four lanes.
- It was because the...
- The what?
- The alignment?
- That's not what I said.
- That's what you said.
- No!
- Pull over!
- What?
Pull over right now.
What are you gonna do?
Get out and walk?
There, there,
pine bluff hotel 5 miles.
Take me there.
Yes, Miss Daisy.
Getting the motel room...
...then giving you check
and you are going to hell away.
Sounds good.
Do you work here?
Sometimes.
Good,
I need a room please.
55 even.
Where is my purse?
Dan,
where is my purse?
This purse?
Oh! I guess it's not on me.
Well,
I appreciate you looking.
Yes.
I understand.
Okay,
thank you.
Bye.
It says
you have 25 cents left?
They checked
the entire restaurant parking lot.
Nothing.
I had to cancel
all credit cards.
The good news is
they are going to sent it to my moms.
So we can just
pick it up in Vegas.
You can blow
your own blackjack or something.
If they find it
or something.
What did you say
you had on you?
I didn't.
Okay.
Could you check?
Oh! 83 dollars.
Okay.
Credit Cards?
I have 83 dollars
to my name.
I thought
you were a therapist.
Uh, just...
...playing around.
So you're...
you are poor?
No, you are poor!
I have 83 dollars.
Fine,
whatever.
Is there something
you wanna ask me?
No.
Can we?
Can we what?
Don't be obtuse,
you know.
Can we use my 83 dollars
to get us across the rest of the Country?
Can we?
Can we what?
Can we use your 83 dollars
to get us across the rest of the country?
No.
Why not?
You think 83 dollars is gonna
get us across half a Continent?
I do not know!
We can fill this whole cab
with "what you don't know".
Get your hubby
to wire you some money.
No.
Why not.
I can't call him.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- No.
- You killed him?
- No!
Okey then...
Get him on the phone
so that he can wire you some money...
...and then we can go
the hell of away from here.
- I am not calling him.
- Why not?
- Because...
- Because what?
Because...
You know what?
Forget it.
Just...
just get out, would you?
Leave your crab,
I sell on ebay...
...and you just go
on your marry way.
Holly shit!
You cry alot.
Shut up!
No, auu!
Hey, no, no.
I do not play this,
I am sorry.
We are not doing this,
I don't fight with women.
My neck!
Yeah.
Where are you going?
Bathroom.
There she is.
Where did you go?
I just...
...looking for food.
Are you hungry?
I thought you left.
Find anything good?
Where are you going?
- Good morning.
- Hey there.
Howdy?
What can I do you for?
By 10 bucks
cheap and lonely.
No.
The guy here last night said that...
some sort of breakfast or...
Yes,
a continental breakfast...
...right around the corner
in conference room 1.
Thank you kindly.
I used to have this
all the time growing up.
Can't believe
I never got tired of them.
Oh good.
Because that's
breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Dan!
I know this puts you
in awkward position...
...with the cab company
and everything.
But it means a lot.
So how do we
get you to California?
Where is the nearest airport?
- Where to?
- Elmad.
- But...
- We 'll get you there.
Elmad?
- Probably a suburb.
- Probably.
Yeah, I'll find it,
you just...
Just what?
Fill in the gaps.
Oh, right.
So next thing you know...
...my dad's got
80,000 dollars worth of debt...
...and four tons of
taffy oka pudding in the basement.
Oh, I'll be!
What company did you say
he was with?
it was the Good Topeka business
or Better Topeka...
Something something.
- Never heard of it.
- Yeah, it's not around anymore.
Well,
I can see why!
Next right.
- Right.
- Right.
What?
Was that my street?
- No!
- No!
No, No
that's a a construction...
...we're actually going to
take a scenic route.
- Left
- Right.
And here we are.
There will be
forty-eight and fifty.
How much?
Forty eight.
That's a little bit stiff.
How much is it normally?
Twenty Five.
- Sounds good.
- I'll get your bags.
It was fifty-five right,
fifty-five College?
It was fifty five College.
Which street we are?
This is the Abesis.
Oh I know this is...
I am right
looking back there.
I guess..
Mark, you sit down.
- I think, I'm done.
- Yeah.
How much
do we have left after this?
Hopefully enough
to get us to Colarado.
That's it?
Haven't driven
the car lately, have you?
Yeah, welcome
to the rest of the world.
Maybe we should go
back to the airport.
God, no.
Let's keep going,
we can always do this again.
Good idea.
We'll have better luck
in Denver anyhow.
Yes?
- Hi.
- Hello.
This is going to be
a strange question but...
Did a young man
happened to come here...
...looking to use
your rest room or something?
No.
Did you lose someone?
Yeah.
Yeah, i think
I fell asleep in my car...
...and when I woke up
he was gone.
And I don't know why
he was stop here, or...
...actually I don't know
where I am.
I am sorry.
Well, we are in Bolder.
Arnold, who is it?
Lynnette, did you see some guy
walking around outside?
Oh Gosh, no.
- What's his name?
- Dan Reeves.
Like the football coach?
Sure.
This guy
she was traveling with...
...took off while
she was sleeping in the car.
Oh my goodness!
Oh my goodness!
We will keep an eye
on him for you.
What is he look like?
Oh, I have a picture.
Surprise!
Thom!
That was a classic.
Oh my Gosh!
I can't believe it.
Oh, you should have seen
the looks on your faces!
Well, you had me going.
Dan Reeves.
Oh, i wish you'd let me know
you were coming.
This place is a mess!
Your father promised me
he was gonna sweep that.
We wanted to suprise you.
- It's just an absolute mess.
- Mom, Dad, this is Claire.
Hello.
Hi.
What brings you out here?
You know we had got
this crazy idea that...
...travel across the country,
and I thought, hey...
...I know someone in Bolder, so...
So you drove
from New York just like that.
Just like that.
What fun,
that's fun.
I don't believe it.
- Well, are you guys hungry?
- Not really.
Starving!
Oh wonderful,
let's get you feed.
Come on sweetheart.
- We had just dinner.
- We can't spend too much time...
...we actually have to
back on the road soon, mom.
Okey. What would you
like to eat sweetheart?
Why don't you sit
right here, next to the father...
...and there is
Asian chicken on the table.
It is so very good.
And then
I have some meat loaf...
...and some bean salad.
No, i'll take
some meat loaf.
Ow Ow,
that's a good one isn't it?
Those are surgeons,
that's Tod and Marcia...
...and that's Gracie,
the little olympian...
...and I think you know
the cute guy in the middle.
I just wish you guys
had told me you were coming.
I would have fixed
something a little fancier.
Mom this is great.
- I'll have the chicken, please.
- Asian chicken.
- Delicious!
- So exactly how did this come about?
You know, it was
a spare the moment kind of a thing.
We both had time off from work,
so figured why not.
Thom.
So where you two heading?
Lynnette,
I'll take some meat loaf.
Well, my mom is in Vegas,
so we are gonna go there.
And then I also have some
family in San Diego.
Oww, California girl.
Lynnette!
Well.
Not exatly.
My half sister and
my father live there.
How often
do you get to see them?
Oh, about
every twenty years or so.
I grew up with my mother.
- In Vegas?
- In Vegas.
Atlantic City, Orlando,
pretty much everywhere.
- So how did you two meet?
- Mom
Oh Oh well, excused me!
if somebody would just call
his parents every once in a while...
...and told them about
what's hapening in his life...
...I'd not have to be so noisy.
But so,
do you work together?
No, no, no.
No, I'm in nonprofit I don't think
i'd last very long as a cabby.
A cabby?
Yeah,
like your son.
Thom.
I didn't tell you guys about that.
Do you drive a cab?
Yeap.
Well on the side,
you know for fun.
Well, what happened
to Wall Street?
Nothing happened
to Wall Street, mom.
It's still there.
It's just a...
...you know I got a mobil office,
wifi, a satellite kinda thing...
I just, you know, don't have to
be rooted to a desk anymore.
I can literally work anywhere
if i could just type and off it goes.
I'll have
the chicken if there is...
But,
why a cab driver?
Well,
I mean why not...
...you know,
when in New York, right?
Plus, it's always been
a dream of mine...
...to overhaul
the transit system there.
So I figured,
you know...
...mine's will start
with one out of a fleet.
And so i figured...
So you own a cab?
- It's out front.
- Here?
You just...
You just drove
out here in a taxi cab?
Sure did.
- What fun!
- Yeap.
Goodness!
You came all the way out
from New York in a...
Yes,
it's unbelievable, isn't it?
Uauu!
Uauu, uauu, uauu.
Yeap.
Is it one of the checkers
or is it little yellow one?
I always like the yellow one.
- It's... It is yellow.
- Oh, God.
Well, if you could
excuse me for a moment?
Oh! Sure, if you need to
the bathroom sweetheart...
...it's just pass
the pantry on the right.
You wanted a meat loaf?
Chicken.
Asian Chicken,
good for you.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
- What fun.
- Yeah.
So how much is he
charging you Claire?
No, I'm kidding,
I'm so kidding.
Well it was very
really nice to meet you.
I just wish
we had more time together.
Are you sure
you don't wanna stay until breakfast?
Because your father
doesn't even have to leave...
...until ten o'clock
and we can...
Yeah,
I am sure, mom.
Alright.
How are you doing in cash?
Need some money
for gas or what not?
No.
Okey...
Alright.
Pleasure.
So, you have your dad's
new telephone number?
Yes.
Okay, you call
when you get to California.
- Yeah, i will.
- Just to let us know if you're alright.
- Okey
- Okey
- Safe trip!
- Thanks.
You okay?
Let me know if you need to switch.
You can't drive.
Not legally.
Claire.
Wow!
Did you know about this?
I have no idea
how we got here.
That's impressive
what with you...
...driving the car alone.
I must have dozzed off.
No,
I dozzed off...
...you apparently
went into a coma.
We're alive, aren't we?
Let's back
get in the car and...
...find the highway.
The highway
you drove off?
- Yes
- How do we do that Claire?
Is there an onramp?
I am not seeing it.
We follow the tracks.
What tracks Claire?
Unless you sprinkled
bread crams for us to follow.
- There no tracks.
- Why are you being an ass?
It's all like
I meant to do this.
You realize that
makes it even worse, right?
Because that means
we have no way of getting back.
Fine,
you stay here.
I am sure tumbleweeds can appreciate
your sarcasm hell out of more than I can.
That was gonna
be so cool, wasn't it?
Are you driving off.
Can I?
So when exactly were you
diagnosed as a compulsive liar?
- I'm not a compulsive liar.
- Neah.
You're
hall of famer Dan Reeves.
Yeah,
I lied about that.
And about
being a therapist.
And Wall Street tycoon.
And just now
about not being liar.
- It's kinda oversimplify for you, isn't it.
- Well, it's kinda simple.
You lie eventually.
I don't see
what the big deal is.
We were always like...
you know what...
...let's just be completely
brutally honest about everything.
And somewhere
along the lines that turns into...
...I hate to just squeeze from
the wrong end of the toothpaste.
Or... or you know
when you're making that face...
...when you're making love.
Don't do that. That's ugly.
Or I wish
you looked like a model.
And I wanted to have sex with
every person I've seen today except you.
You feel better?
I know, I do.
I am so glad
I got that off my chest.
I mean, I wouldn't much rather tell
a few white lies then put in all that work.
And the lies back
at your parents house that wasn't work...
All that back pedaling...
And for what?
They don't care if you're
some Wall Street zillioner.
They just
want you to be happy.
- And how would you know that?
- Because they are unhappy.
- They are?
- Completely.
Your dad keeps
everything bottled...
...and your mom
barely acknowledges your dad.
Whatever those two had
when they got married...
...they give up
a long time ago.
Yeah,
you know what...
...it can't be always
rainbows and chocolate hearts.
You know, they had kids, responsibilities
eventually they have to settle down.
Some people settle down
and some people just settle.
Well, it's clearly
it's a category you fit into.
What?
Oh come off it, you escaped New York,
faster than Kurt Russel.
And then you demanded I take you back
what you feel like I'm scaming you.
And then you... you...
You asked me to drop you...
...over a motel
in the middle of nowhere.
I mean, make up your mind
you are like a ping pong ball.
Someone gives you a little tap
and you just go flying.
I left New York because
I caught my husband having in an affair.
Ooh.
Yeah, ooh.
You...
You like a caught him?
Pretty much.
There was definetly
something going on.
But you didn't see anything?
I didn't see...
need to see something...
I just know.
There was no like emails...
...you didn't find pictures
from the Bahamas or anything?
I just know.
Why are you laughing?
When I drove off the road...
...you caught me.
This. This just sound like
someone looking for a way out.
How much further you think?
Depends.
On what?
Where we're going.
Toward that or away from that.
We can be...
...two days
nearest road by now.
Great attitude.
Let's stop crapping ourselves, shall we?
The likelihood of us
getting out of this alive...
...gets slimmer the longer
we're out here.
If the cold doesn't get us tonight,
the heat will tomorrow.
Would you shut up?
You wanna pretend
there's a Marriott over the next horizon...
...you go ahead
and do that.
But I would much rather
spend my energy...
...trying to figure out
how to, you know...
...keep each other warm.
How do you suggest
we do that?
No thanks.
I'm not talking about...
Whatever.
You think it's cold now?
Wait a few hours.
Thom.
Almost done.
Great.
So we should be
on the road no time.
Why are you
so camera shy?
- I'm not photogenic.
- I find that very hard to believe.
I can show you
some school pictures.
Oh come on.
Oh yeah, I can show you
one from third grade.
My mom, she did my hair up
in a really hot perm.
It was really sexy.
That sounds really sexy.
And then she put
all this makeup on my face and...
...put me in a slaughter vest
that I really really hated it.
I looked like a rodeo clown.
I got teased on the bus,
it was that bad.
Anyway a few years later
I went to go visit my dad and Eve.
That's my sister.
Half sister.
And wouldn't you know it,
that picture's on his fridge.
And he said.
See,
I look at you every day.
But it wasn't me.
Wasn't even me
in third grade.
It's just a picture.
Can I take your picture?
No.
Come on.
Did you just hear
my whole story?
Look, when you get old,
like really old.
You may wanna share
your memories. Okey?
Maybe not a hot perm rodeo Claire,
but definetly have something like this.
Why can't this
taken without me?
Because
without you in the picture...
it's a flat shot,
it's like postcard but if you...
Alright.
Alright, here,
go on, take a look.
Alright.
Put me on like center the frame.
You see
how it's a little easier...
...to take in all of it
with something in the foreground?
Yes, it's not the same.
Yeah, exactly.
So.
Can I take your picture?
Alright, you're looking at
355 all toll.
I thought
it was an easy fix!
It was but
with the toll, it is 355.
We can't pay that.
We can't pay that.
I am sorry.
I actually don't think
that you understand.
I lost my purse
four cities back and...
...when I say that
we can't pay that...
- ...I actually mean that.
- You should have thought of that...
Okey.
Call the taxi company.
Yeah, I don't know
if the taxi company...
I mean, I am sure
they have roadside assistance...
...triple A something like that.
This car is not
registered under any company.
So no, there is
no roadside assistance.
Okay, hold on I figured out,
you know what, I got something.
What are you talking about?
If this was a commercial vehicle
then have different plates.
This car isn't registered
under any company anywhere.
Just the Tom Covanake,
that guy, okay?
- So there will be...
- 355.
Thank you very much.
Alright, hold on.
Okey, I'm aware this is bad.
Is there anything else?
What?
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?
I bought this
at an auction last spring.
And... and when
I get really loan cash...
...I used to pick people up.
It's not something
I do all the time...
I just... I got kicked out of
my apartment the first night you met me.
And I didn't tell you
because I needed make money.
And then I didn't tell you
because I was embarrassed...
...and I was just,
you know, it was too late.
Also the DVDs
in the back are all mine.
Also the first night
when you fall asleep in the back...
...I looked up your skirt.
A lot.
The cash...
The cash wasn't mine.
It was my parents,
and I didn't borrow it from them.
I stole it, and this morning...
This morning I...
...I heard the highway and
I didn't wake you because...
...I wanted to
sleeping with you and...
Do you have a...
You have
absolutely nothing to go on.
I want you
to know that I am...
...I'm tired of
the way I am and...
...I will never lie to you again.
I know.
I know he will be
really happy and sleep well...
...knowing that
you are in safe and sound.
He is your husband, you know.
I do know that.
Look, I am not gonna
get in the middle of it.
I just think
he deserves a call.
Let him know
you are okey.
Call him.
Maybe.
- Well I try.
- Yes you did, yes you did.
Thom, have you met
Claire's better half yet?
You know,
I have... I have not yet.
He is quite a catch.
He is like
seven feet of muscle.
He gave me
the most beautiful sweater for Christmas.
It's cashmere.
- It's just simply gorgeous.
- And practical here in Nevada.
Well I think it's beautiful.
It's a lot nicer than
the golf clubs Jered got me.
I mean what the hell
was I gonna do with golf clubs?
Except maybe clunk him
over the head with one.
Mom.
Sweetheart.
You got my message
about your father, right?
Yeah, we're driving
in the morning.
- How are you feeling about that.
- Fine.
- We'll talk later.
- What is your talk about?
I even called yet.
I decided I'll just go and see him.
He is still in the hospital?
You didn't get my message.
Monday night.
No, I left another one after that.
His serves is tomorrow.
I'm sorry Claire.
- Claire! Claire.
- That's okey...
Claire, honey!
Alright,
alright, come on.
No, no, no,
Claire, come on.
- No, no, don't, don't do this.
- Get out!
Hold on.
Just breathe here.
Just don't... alright, listen,
take this... no, no, no.
That's okey, that's okey,
I do that all the time.
Pick up my can.
Pick it up.
My can.
Just a second.
Okey.
Sorry.
Come in the back there.
The towels are
in the closet by the bathroom.
Thanks.
I'm cryin' already and
I didn't even like him.
I brought lotsa goodies; I got potato chips
and I got pretzels and I got a lotta gum.
Do I look alright? I was gonna do
a hot perm but I didn't have time.
This is good.
What you got going on?
Look at this beautiful house.
Eve.
Claire.
You're so tanning.
- You're practically Mexican.
- Mom.
- That is a compliment.
- This is the Thom.
Hi, Eve.
Hello,
nice to meet you.
This is my husband Allen,
this is Gil.
Hello.
How do you do.
Hello, nice to meet you.
Welcome, welcome.
- And this is Claire.
- Hi, Claire, lovely to meet you.
Oh my God.
- Erik, my big bear.
- How are you?
I wear your sweater all the time.
I would expect nothing less.
Hi.
I got on the plane
as soon as I heard.
When was that?
Last night.
Well, I got to see a man
about the dog.
- Eve, may I use your boudoir?
- Yes.
- Alright, Thom.
- Hey, Eric.
I heard a lot about you.
Claire, can we talk?
- Do you want a beer?
- Yeah, yeah.
How was the drive?
- Well...
- Long.
It's last month...
...we have been working a lot together,
getting pretty close, you know.
I don't know, I guess I just liked to
talk to somebody else about us.
I don't know.
Anyway, along that time
that's when we had our big fight...
I knew
we had to work things out...
...so call Candy
with the house to call it off...
...because
I just wanted to stop it before...
That's you came home
and found us.
Claire,
it's not her fault, okey?
It's my fault,
I let it go on too long...
I should have stopped it
before it got out of hand, and uh
She is a great girl
and I'm sure...
...under different circumstance
you two make great...
The point's, Claire, is that
I never crossed that line.
You gotta believe that.
Because I believe
we can work things out.
- I'll be working on being...
- On what?
Mean we're married?
Or in love.
Both.
Hi.
Sorry to interrupt but
I think everyone is here.
Are you gonna walk down?
Yeah, thanks Eve.
We'll be right out.
You know
when you were gone, I...
I nearly losted.
Come home,
empty house you weren't there.
I don't wanna
feel like that ever again.
Judging by how many people
showed up here today.
I think It's...
...safety say that dad was...
...was probably
the loneliest man on earth.
It's understandable he was...
...hard man to know.
And he didn't
believe in second chances.
What's done is done.
I don't buy that.
We can change.
We do change.
We don't have to take
our regrets to the grave like he did.
We can be free of all of that.
We don't die inhaling.
We exhale.
We leave it all behind.
Oh! Thanks.
I like her, I do.
He is...
He is...
He is not me.
I hope the check is okey.
It's fine.
You going back to New York?
You know,
I can be poor anywhere.
I might as well be
on the road for a little while.
Where is the...
where is the airport from here?
I do not know.
I thought you said
you didn't fly.
Well it's time
I got over it.
Those pilots know
what they're doing.
And it's safer than driving.
Depends
who is driving.
I think that's everything sweetheart
but you forgot your scarf so may I...
Hey Thom, you...
..you live out of your car, pal?
Why is that?
I... Well... Why is that? Well,
look at all the decorations in this bad boy.
Isn't it great?
It...It... looks
like a Pottery Barn in here.
But it's great, it's... it's..
it's great.
I'll take a last look.
Yeah, that sounds like a...
...good idea.
- I think we're all good.
- You shouldn't have to go.
Claire!
What did you just say?
I said...
I wish you could stay.
I can't do that.
I know.
Claire!
Hey, Claire!
I'm sorry about your father.
Thank you.
He...
He really miss a lot.
You're only one
does have to be here.
- Okey.
- Alright.
I want sweaters
for Christmas please.
I'll clean this shit,
I promise.
There's no pay.
- Be carefull.
- I love you.
I love you too, guys.
We're looking to you, guys.
- Goodbye guys.
- Goodbye guys.
Doesn't get any easier, darling
She's been in my life for 29 years
and it still hurts to see her go.
Okay,
we're gonna get back on the 5...
...we're gonna
drive for about 60 miles...
...and then we're gonna
see that burger joint...
... and we are
gonna stop there...
Come on!
Come on!
Battery Park City.
Did Dan see it?
And what did he say?
Then what's the problem?
That's exactly what I was telling...
Sorry sugar.
You know what, look...
Okay good, so, see you're
basically telling me Selena that I spent...
...what four and a half hours
on a plane reading stupid thing...
...I never gonna be
actually dealing with.
No, you told me that
he actually read it.
Right, now are you telling me
that he just read it now?
Why didn't you tell me this
when I was in California?
Okey look,
do me a favor...
...not telling me do something
unless he has made a decision...
- Home sweet home.
- Home sweet home.
I love seeing
those little colored balls.
If you find my eyelash...
...would you mail it to me?
Because that's human hair.
Sure I will.
And I hear my phone ringing.
Everything happens as soon as I move.
Are you telling me,
I mean you... you're talking insane.
Who would call this?
Give her on the phone.
Okey.
- Hello.
- Hey.
Did you make it home
in one piece?
No, no. No, no that's...
Oh God, no, that's Bill Samorack.
No, no, no,
this is Bill Walls.
The exhibition artist.
Remember? He was the guy
who had that show in Greenpoint...
...where he hung himself
from a flagpole by his nipples, remember?
Right, right
I remember.
Well, he and I went to
one of those parties everybody is in cages.
Right.
And you know, people are
crawling all over each other...
...pretending
to be wild animals.
What were you?
A turkey.
The Bill was a dolphin.
How cute is that.
Oh my God.
We had the best time.
Susan,
I'm really happy for you.
Yeah...
it's about time, huh?
Yeah.
Before I forget,
San Diego called...
...about celebrity auction.
Are you gonna be able to go?
Yeah, that's fine
I'll just give them a call in the morning.
Right.
Right.
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you Susan.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hola my beautiful sister, it's Eve.
Happy Belated Easter.
For what that's worth,
I don't know.
I got your message and
I think that would be so awesome.
Lady, you pick the date,
I am there.
We eat, we surf...
...we do everything you're
supposed to do here in beautiful Encinitas.
Which is..err...
easier than surfing.
Now I think about it,
anyway call me, I love you.
Hey, it's...
It's Eric.
It's call when you know
I dropped out some your mail.
Your landlord said that
I can put it inside your apartment for you.
So, I just wanted
to make sure you got it.
I hope you're doing okey.
That's it,
okey, bye.
