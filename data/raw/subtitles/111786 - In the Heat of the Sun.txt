Peiking has changed so fast.
In 20 years, it's become a modern city.
Almost nothing is as I remembered.
Change has wiped out my memorise.
I can't tell what's
imagined from what's real.
My stories always take place in summer.
People expose more of
themselves in the heat.
and find it harded to
control their desires.
It seemed like it was
always summer then.
The sun always had time to
come out and play with us.
The sunlight was so relentless,
so bright,
that our eyes were washed
in waves of blackness.
In the Heat of the Sun.
In the raging stroms of Revolution.
The soldiers' hearts
turn towards the sun.
Oh, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao.
We want to express our ardour to you.
You launched the Cultural Revolution.
and your military
victories are stunning.
Your brilliant thoughts
are like dew and sunlight.
After the 9th Party Congress in 1969.
my father was sent to
Guizhou as an army rep.
to stop factional battles
taking place there.
I longed for a Sino-Soviet war.
I was sure
that in a new world war...
...the PLA's iron fist would
smash the Soviets and Americans.
A new war hero would become a legend -
that's me, of course.
Hurry
wild goose hurry on your way.
With a letter from the
liberated serfs under your wing.
passing on love to
Chairman Mao in Peking.
After Dad left
I was freer than I'd ever been.
I always envied kids whose
parents worked out of town.
Now I was one of them.
Let's bet that
who can toss their bag the highest.
What's the wager?
icepops?
Butter flavour.
Two.
Ok.
let me go first!
No.
We'll start with Big Ant.
See if you can get is
as high as the roof.
Ok,
go for it Big Ant.
1, 2, 3
No good.
Your turn Liu Sitian.
1, 2, 3
No good, no good!
Yang Gao, your turn.
1, 2, 3
Oh, look at that stupid thing!
Your turn, Monkey.
1, 2, 3
You are such a lazy bastard...
You even hold on to your bag yourself?
Come on!
Big Ant! Big Ant!
And so I graduated from primary school.
We were all sent to
different high schools.
This was a policy of the school...
aimed at breaking up our little gangs.
But several years later...
Our families all moved to
the same army compound...
and I was reunited with my mates.
Gooloomoo!
Oo-ba!
Gooloomoo!
Oo-ba!
In the seventies.
Beijing didn't have so
many cars or luxury hotels.
or even that many people on the street.
The older kids were in
the villages or army.
and the town belonged to us.
Time for class. Attention!
Hello students!
Hello teacher!
Don't laugh.
It's a simple principle of physics.
Sit down.
Who said you could get up?
Take your seat!
I mean, first put that hat
back and take your seat.
Yes, Mr Hu.
Who's class monitor?
She is.
Get back here.
Who's asking you?
I am asking class monitor
to identify herself.
After class, get rid of these coals.
Open your books to page 35.
Let's look at the Sino-Russion
Treaty of Nerchinsk.
"Sino"
refers to the Qing dynasty.
"Russian"
to czarist Russia.
But Nerchinsk,
what's Nerchinsk?
It's the reginon east
of the Baykal Lake.
Who did this?
What's the meaning of this, huh?
Who?
It wasn't me. My hands are clean.
Hold up your hands, everyone.
Mr Hu.
Speak up.
Never mind.
Speak up,
don't be afraid.
Maybe it was to keep the
hat from flying off again.
It was well-intentioned.
So don't be angry.
I'm asking who did it!
Well I don't know.
Sit down.
Don't be angry. Mr Hu.
Class is adjourned.
I shall get to that bottom of this!
Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu!
Would you mind tossing me my shoe?
Sure, and I'll wipe your
ass in the toilet too!
Shall I help you put it on as well?
NO,
Just toss it out here, please.
Get out of here!
You rotten apple!
Mr. Jiao!
Someone
get Mr. Jiao of the Workers
Propaganda Team here right now!
Jeez, Hu.
give me a bit of face, OK?
I'm not asking for much.
OK, just you wait!
Wait for what?
What a joke?
What are you going to do?
don't threaten me.
Fine. I don't need that stupid show.
come back here!
Going to have someone beat me?
Puncture my bicycle
tyres? Stab me in the back?
No one wants your filthy shoe.
Attention! March in time!
Our leaders should rest assured,
we will complete our mission.
8-5-1, 8-5-1, this is
Yan'an, this is Yan'an.
Fire in my direction!
Fire in my direction!
I loved keys.
I learned how to make them.
I practiced on all the locks at home.
peering into my parents' secrets.
Then I gegan going into
other people's homes.
The "click" of a lock popping open.
propelled me into a
realm of sheer bliss.
This feeling
This feeling, only the Soviet army attacking
Berlin in WWll could have felt what I feel.
I can't hid it.
I got my talent from my father.
In the Korean War.
he worked out how to
countless American bombs.
Lots of people lost
their lives that way.
but he came out of it
without a scratch...
which is why Mom suspects
that all his time in Korea
was spent hiding out in the mountains.
I'd check carefully for any cash.
The machines everyone demands
today were unkown then.
Work units provided
most of the furniture.
I can testify that at the time...
expect for a very few
politically suspect cadres.
there was virtually
no corruption at all.
In all my exploits...
I only spotted one old
Soviet black-n-white TV.
I considered stealing it,
but it was too heavy.
Besides,
I vowed I'd only break in,
I wouldn't be a thief.
When I tired myself out..
I'd take a nap on the bed.
imagining what might
have happened there.
I knew I'd never be caught.
'cause no one ever snuck
out of their office then.
And I never stold anything,
so I didn't arouse any suspicion.
Of course, I ran into
trouble from time to time.
But this didn't dampen my courage.
it only increased the thrill.
Usually, I only went for
padlocks, they were safe.
But that day, something moved
me to pick a built-in one.
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.
Well, Hu, you've fallen low!
This is Yu Beipei,
from the Foreign Ministry compound.
This is our mate, Ma Xiaojun.
Come on up!
That's Liu Yiku.
Liu Sitian's stepbrother..
just out of the army.
He was handsome.
and fought dirty.
We thought he was terrific,
'cause he always brought home girls.
She was called Yu Beipei.
That "pei" is usually pronounced "bei".
But we called her Yu Beipei...
and even she didn't
know which was correct.
I didn't know you were waiting?
No one told me anything.
Had a date, did you?
Fuck you! No way!
Don't be embarrassed, Monkey!
Say it! Who had the date.
Enough, enough.
what thin skin!
What's so bad about having a date?
Wasn't it a date that
brought me here today?
Who with?
Him.
Come, sit over here.
Just ignore them,
they've got dirty minds.
She's talking about you, Ant.
Ignorant fool! Filthy mind!
I'm wasting my breath on you!
Now he's talking!
Forget it, have a cigarette.
Yu Beipei..
next time bring Mi Lan with you.
We want to meet her.
You want to chat here up?
Find her yourself.
Haven't you said no girl
can resist your charms?
Seriously.
we hear so much about her.
She's a legend.
Guys have fought over her..
friendships have ended
and some have died.
All we ask is that you introduce us.
Forget it, she's a proper sort.
I didn't say she wasn't.
Anyway, I've asked her.
and she said no.
The photo I discovered
that day put me in a daze.
She filled my entire field of vision.
The implications of her gaze..
were bounded only by my imagination.
I had no idea she was the
Mi Lan everyone talked about.
Gooloomoo!
Oo-ba!
Kiss, and one more.
Catch him!
You OK, Yu Beipei?
I'll bite you to death.
Let go, let go!
Let me go!
I'll get you, you little bastard!
Forget it, leave him alone, Yu Beipei.
Beautiful flowers
blossom across the land.
Friends are coming from distant places.
Flowers of friendship
blossom across the land.
Welcome! Welcome! Warmly welcome!
Welcome! Welcome! Warmly welcome!
I was always hanging out there..
like a cat on a hot tin roof.
frantic for the girl in
the picture to appear.
Like a ghost..
she came and went without a trace.
Only my intuition and
a lingering fragrance..
could verify her existence.
I'd wait till the stars
were high in the sky,
and still nothing.
the ambassador.
It's Koreans.
How would you know?
It's true.
But didn't the ambassador
come last night?
What would you know?
There's no just on, you know.
There's gotta be two or there at least.
Maybe this one's from South Korea?
What the fuck would you know?
South Korea is America's.
We wouldn't even let him in.
Running dog!
Who's a running dog?
Hey, which country
is she ambassador for?
Yu Beipei, go get her
to come talk to us.
Have some soda.
What'd you say to her?
Are you a dancer?
yes.
At Youth Palace?
Can you tell me your name?
I'm Ma Xiaojun.
I'm Zhang Xiaomei. "Xiao" as in "dawn".
The "Xiao" in my name means "samll".
These guys really are a pain.
Where do you think you're going?
I love music,
just wanted to see the concert.
Just because you're a music lover
you pretend to be a foreigner.
And the Korean ambassador at that.
What's the real story?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
What d'ya mean, what's wrong?
What the hell..
"what the hell"?!
I didn't do anything.
Right.
I've had my eye on you. Come on!
What'd I do? I didn't do anything.
And the girl there,
you're coming in as well.
Your father's name?
Ma Wenzhong.
Your mother?
Zhai Ru.
Where do you live?
No. 11 Internal Affairs
Department Street.
What are you looking at?
Just found this. What a menace!
Don't let that sort of
thing slip by next time.
That gang's not going anywhere.
Carrying arms!
Gonna rebel, were they?
We'll take'em to lockup this evening.
Guoqing!
Hear that?
Uncle, Uncle, please let me go.
What are you crying
about? What's his story?
I was waiting for tickets,
and they hauled me in.
Look at you, you think
half of Peking is your turf.
If it's anyone's turf, it's ours.
Get that? yes.
Wipe the snot off your nose..
and don't show you
face round here again.
Get that?
This isn't mine, that is.
that.
You taking it or what?
yes.
If not, you're welcome
to spend the night here.
I'm taking it! This one is fine!
Go fetch my belt.
My belt! Go get it!
Don't you think you're Mr. Tough?
Lose your nerve, have you?
Get up off your knees..
and stop crying.
I don't buy that crap.
When I cry,
it's just to confuse you wimps.
What's if your business
if I pick up chicks?
I'm not after your mother.
I'm coming back to do it again tomorrow.
I'll be alone.
If you don't arrest
me you can kiss my ass.
I'm the king of half of Peking..
and of your station as well.
OK, Get outta here.
If you don't move it, you're
welcome to spend the night.
Who's there?
Someone's bashed Yang Gao.
Fuck!
On his way home..
he saw some kids from Liutiao
bullying the retarded boy.
They were making him eat catshit..
and trying to take away his pole.
Yang Gao went to his rescue..
and they bashed him up.
He can't open his eyes.
They broke the pole in half.
Let's go.
What about me?
Girls stay behind.
I wasn't involved, mate!
Out of my way!
Yang Gao, was he involved?
Let's go.
Monkey..
when'd you get to be such a thug.
What do you mean?
What you did with that brick?
It was dark. I couldn't see.
Otherwise I'd really have wasted him.
If you told Monkey he was fat he'd loosen
his belt. He's really full of himeself now!
Actually..
Actually what?
I don't think that kid was involved.
Fuck you!
Asshole! Why didn't you say so earlier?
It all happened..
before I got a good look.
He's part of that gang.
What the hell!
Get out of my sight.
Who's there?
Yu Beipei.
Monkey.
You asshole.
I'm going to get you.
Come on out, then. À°¡ÏÖÔÚ¾ÍÀ´°°É
come on, get a move on.
You jerks.
Look at this. My clothes are soaking.
And you've torn the sleeve.
Jeez, you're a pain.
Yu Beipei, you've got to leave. Go away!
No
I won't.
I said, get out!
You bore me!
Hiding like that..
as if anyone wanted to look at you guys.
Oh no! Those are my clothes!
I don't care whose they are.
Monkey.
this all your fault.
He's erect!
The bastard's got an erection!
He's erect!
You scumbag!
I have to pee.
Get outta here.
Hei.
Talking to me?
Haven't we met somewhere before?
Forget it, kid.
You're not old enough for this.
Wait, don't go!
Don't you live in that building?
Do you go to school down the street?
Yes, I've seen you.
at the door of the police station.
You were with a policewoman.
Can we be friends?
Is that necessary?
I don't think so.
Why not be friends?
You're obviously a very bad boy.
Can't we just get to know each other?
Be an elder sister to me.
Find your elder sisters elsewhere.
If you won't be friends, I'll..
You'll what?
Beat me up?
Yeah.
Really?
You really think if we fought you'd win?
Kid,
come over here.
How old are you?
sixteen.
Let me look at you.
No way you're sixteen, liar!
And you? How old are you?
Older than you.
Still want me to be your elder sister?
Yes! How can I put it...
you're just like my sister.
You have a sister?
No.
What's your name?
Ma Xiaojun.
Really.
It's here on my book bag.
I'm not lying, and you?
Mi Lan.
You're Mi Lan?
So?
Nothing. Uh, you don't
spend much time at home?
How do you know?
You live at No. 5. I've
been to you building.
Go home..
before you get into
trouble with your parents.
Go home.
But I've still got something to say.
There's something I forgot.
Uh, have you been to Beihai Park?
Nice try but forget it..
kid.
Time to little children to go home.
So..
you will be my elder sister?
Only if you do as I say.
I promise.
Ok, then run off home now.
OK!
And no more picking
up girls on the street!
I swear before Chairman
Mao this was my first time.
Bye!
Uh, can I really come visit you?
You really are your father's son, you!
He's never at home..
and neither are you.
You treat this place like a hotel..
and me like a maid.
Aren't you something else!
Get me some water.
And a bowl!
Trying to scald me to death?!
No.
You make me so angry.
No, Mom.
I'll kill you.
I'm going to give you a beating!
No, Mom.
Don't, Ma.
No, don't hit me.
You're never here.
You're never home, you
little son of a bitch.
You little son of a bitch.
You hang out with those bad kids.
One day I know you'll end up in jail.
and no one will sympathise.
This is a letter from your teacher.
Read it. Read it!
Other children..
come home to do their
homework after school.
But you?
It's dark and you're still not home!
What's going on, huh?!
Why don't you..
be exactly like your father..
and never come home?
Get out, go!
Go!
You're free.
Go visit the police whenever.
Why don't you just
move directly to jail?!
I'm an educated women..
with a proper upbringing.
but I've been a "dependent"..
since your dad joined the army.
Is that all I deserve? Me?
I'm so furious... I'd like
to burn down the house.
I can see your father
in you and you in him.
Peas out of the same rotten pod you are.
If you were a chicken,
I wouldn't even eat your meat.
I hate you that much.
You hate me too, don't you...
When have you ever done
anything to make me proud?
You disappoint me.
I regret ever having had you.
You bastard.
I never hit or cursed anyone..
before your father and you came along.
Turtle spawn!
Get out of here!... Oh!... Aaah!
In a fit of anger, my mother
gave birth to my brother.
My mates look her to the army hostital..
on the back of a bicycle cart.
'cause the driver...
couldn't get the jeep started.
I thought.
what sort of war-preparedness is this?
An attack by the imperialists..
and we'd be dead meat.
Ma always cursed Dad
when she was beating me.
but her curses brought
him home this time.
When I got older I realised
my brother's birth..
had to do with my breaking
into Dad's drawer...
and puncturing that big balloon.
That kid from Liutiao was
in hospital for a month.
His mates sent word...
that..
there'd be a rumble on Monday...
at the Marco Polo Bridge.
We could each take 100 people.
I couldn't help feeling nervous...
and regretted trying so much
to be a hero with that brick.
They demanded my participation.
My thoughts turned to Mi Lan.
I had to see her immediately.
Maybe it would be the last time.
The bastard's here. Let me go see him.
What for?
Act smart...
and watch for my signal.
Are you Ma Xiaojun?
Yeah!
Was it you who hit him with a brick?
yes.
The rumble never got underway...
despite all the planning.
We went to the old Moscow Restaurant.
Brothers of the 4 Seas & 5 Continents..
the supreme virtue is
- unity!
Cheers!
I discovered a rule.
With a dozen people...
you can fight to death.
With hundreds involved,
the fight never gets going.
'Cause the more you drag in...
the more likely it is...
that the same people will
be friendly with both sides.
So it was this time.
We'd both gone for the
most fared bully in Peking.
He had an awesome reputation.
and everyone talked about
his underhanded ways.
This was my first...
and last encounter with him.
He was later...
killed by teenage punks who
wanted to take his place.
All I remember is that
his hand was so soft,
it was like a girl's.
So I got off without a scratch.
But something else was
driving me completely mad.
Mi Lan seemed to be avoiding me.
Mi Lan.
Mi Lan!
Mi Lan!
Who's there?
Oh, it's you.
Come over here.
Why aren't you in school?
Uh..
Teacher's sick. We're having
study period. I snuck out.
Have you been by before?
No.
Hmph, Why not?
I've been busy with...
end of term exams...
I haven't had any time.
I've been really busy.
Really busy.
And I was thinking...
where he's disappeared to?
Off meeting other "elder sister"?
No, no.
So...
have you met anyone new lately?
Seems like I've nothing better to do!
No, definitely not.
OK!
Give me a hand, would you?
Sure.
Fetch that kettle from the hallway?
Careful, don't burn yourself.
No problem. Don't worry.
Let me help you rinse it.
Thanks.
Put in a bit of cold water first.
Oh, Ok. Too hot?
No, go ahead!
It's so hot.
And summer's barely begun.
Can you swim?
No.
And you?
Yes, I'll show you some day.
Great.
If I fall in...
you can save me then?
You bet...
though you're a bit big for me so
I'll have to work out a bit first.
Every day, in Shisha Lake.
What about school?
When I finish with exams, we...
Put it over there.
Yeah, we can go there together.
Stand there, don't move.
OK.
What are you studying?
Studying?
Dunno..
I mean, how to make wine...
and, uh, violins...
sesame paste, stuff like that.
Where do you learn those silly things?
From the workers and peasants!
We worked for a month
in the wine factory,
got into a big fight there,
200 of them,
but we won,
and now we always carry
cleavers in our bookbags.
This older kid was begging for mercy,
but we slashed him up anyway.
Really?
So what do they test you on?
Wine-making or fighting?
Sit down.
You kidding?
We were only there one month.
the rest of the time
we're in the classroom.
I like reading.
What sort of books do you like?
How Steel Is Tempered,
Gadfly,
The Song of Youth, Bitter
Blossoms, that sort of thing.
Do you like the heroine Dunya?
I like Pavel,
but I like Dunya too.
Pity how she changed...
and became bourgeois.
Have you finished all those books? No.
Why not?
They're just old books
without beginning or end.
What about "200 Songs"? You read that?
Of course!
200 Folk Songs from Abroad.
It's a songbook.
I can't read music, I
just read the lyrics.
Why don't you teach me to sing them?
Sure, no problem.
Where do you work?
Really far away.
So why aren't you there?
I'm just back,
I usually stay there.
That's why you're never home.
So you have come to see me?
No.
Liar.
My grandma told me you've been by.
A kid would call out "Mi Lan"...
and run when she opened the door.
That wasn't me.
Really.
Fine.
Anyway, I'm on sick leave.
Come visit anytime.
What's wrong? Mind your own business.
Isn't there a photo of
you in a bathing suit?
Nonsense!
When have I ever worn a bathing suit?
It was hanging right
there. I'm sure of it.
There was a photo, but I
wasn't in a bathing suit.
Impossible! Show it to me.
A friend took it.
I'm positive you were in a bathing suit.
Such a stubborn kid!
Want to see?
Strange! I'm so sure.
Really?
Just like this one,
but with a bathing suit.
No?
Hanging right here?
Just tell me this, am I
wearing a bathing suit?
No, you're not.
I don't get it.
It was hanging there, I
remember it was in color.
OK...
why don't you a photo
of me like that sometime?
OK.
Can I keep this one?
No.
Come on.
No.
Why do you want my photo anyway?
You really won't give it to me?
Then I'll steal it.
You'd dare!
Stop it!
