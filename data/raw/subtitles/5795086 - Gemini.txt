Devin.
Is this fucking Tracy?
No, it's Jill.
Well...
...is Heather there?
No, I'm not with her
right now.
Why do you have her phone
if you're not with her?
What are you calling about,
Devin?
Just tell her
I know what's up.
- You know what's up?
- That's right.
And tell her to fuck off,
and I'm going to
fucking murder her.
Okay, Devin.
Good bye.
Who was that?
- Did you go in already?
- I didn't go in yet.
- Who was that?
- Uh, Devin.
He says
he knows what's up,
and he's gonna
fucking murder you.
Why haven't you
gone in yet?
I want you
to come in with me.
What? Why?
Okay,
you're gonna kill me.
No, I'm not.
Wait,
what are you gonna do
that's gonna make me
wanna kill you?
I'm not gonna do
the movie.
What do you mean,
you're not gonna do the movie?
I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna
tell him I don't wanna do it...
and I think
it'd be really nice
if you came in with me
for support.
- Okay. You know he's gonna freak out, right?
- Yeah, I know that.
And Jamie is similarly
going to freak out.
Fuck Jamie.
I don't care about Jamie.
Okay. I-I... Why?
Why aren't you
doing the movie?
I don't wanna do anything
for a while.
I think that you should
think about this.
Jill,
I've thought about this.
Okay. This is
a really big decision.
And, you know,
there's no movie without you.
- Right?
- Of course I know that.
I know
this is a big deal.
Okay.
Okay.
- Mm.
- Okay.
Jill.
What?
Good evening.
Are you looking for someone?
Uh, I am,
but I just found him.
- Thank you.
- Okay, great.
- Hi, Jill.
- Hey, Greg.
Where the fuck
is Heather?
- Uh, she's not coming.
- Okay.
I know you just didn't tell me
that she's not coming,
- because we have a ton of shit to talk about.
- I know.
And I've been here
for like, half an hour,
so I know you didn't just tell me
that she's not fucking coming.
And for that matter, what are
you doing here in person
if she's not even coming?
Can I get you guys started
with some apps?
- Apps?
- Apps. Appetizers.
Have you looked them over?
If not, I can recommend
something or give you more time.
Whatever you'd like.
Yeah, I think
we're just drinking.
Okay. That sounds great.
What would you
like to drink?
Uh, well, actually,
he's just drinking.
If it's okay for now,
I'm just here.
- Great. That's no problem.
- Okay.
You know what?
I am... I'm gonna have apps.
I'm gonna have
one of everything.
One of everything?
That's actually
a lot of food.
- I will have one of every single app, yeah.
- Okay.
Well our bruschetta
usually comes in pairs,
but do you just want one?
- No, I'll have the pair.
- Okay. That's perfect.
I'll get your order in
right away.
Thank you.
Jill.
Greg.
You wanna tell me
what you're doing here?
She's not doing the movie.
Okay.
Greg!
How'd it go?
Oh, um, I dunno.
I think it went bad.
- It went bad?
- Mm-hmm. I think so.
What is this?
That is an old-fashioned
that Greg was drinking.
Should I answer?
- That was fast.
- Should I answer?
- Yeah, answer.
- Are you here?
Jamie.
Are you kidding me?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know exactly what.
Is she with you?
Jamie, it's okay.
What... What do you mean,
"It's okay"?
You know what?
We're in a restaurant
right now.
I'll come in tomorrow
and we'll talk about it, okay?
Heather,
I wanna kill you right now.
Don't be so harsh.
I'm not being harsh.
You are being crazy.
Do you know
how much this fucks me,
how much it fucks
all of us?
Jamie,
I'm gonna go now, okay?
Put Jill back on!
N... Okay.
You know what?
I'll step outside,
and we'll talk.
Well?
Hey.
Uh, sorry to bother you.
I'm Sierra.
I'm a big fan of Heather's.
Oh.
You're her assistant,
right?
Uh...
Eh... Yes.
You don't have to worry.
I'm... I'm not gonna
bother you guys.
I just...
I had to come up and say hello.
Okay, I'm really sorry,
but, uh,
you really shouldn't be here
- when she gets back.
- No-no-no, I totally understand,
but it would be really cool
if I could just hang out here
for a minute.
Hello.
Hi.
Your assistant
tried to save you,
but I've just wanted
to meet you for so long
that I wouldn't take no
for an answer.
I have to tell,
you... you're even
more beautiful in person.
Thank you.
I'm sure the two of you
just wanna hang out on your own.
Um, just seriously,
it would mean so much to me
if I could just
hang out here for a minute.
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
Actually,
could we take a picture?
I would love it
if we could take
a picture together.
Uh, no.
Now is not a good time
for photos.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
We can take a photo.
Okay.
Would you mind?
Uh, okay.
All right.
Can you do one
without the flash, actually?
We got the photo.
No, it's okay.
Let's do it again.
Do you know
how to turn the flash off?
Yes, I know
how to turn the flash off.
- Oh.
- Okay.
Great.
- Did it turn out okay?
- Yeah, they're both great.
I feel like the first one
was better.
No.
They're really both good.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.
Sorry, I'm just...
Aah!
...really nervous.
- It's totally fine.
- Um... Okay.
So, um,
as you probably know...
most of information
about you
- is on the Internet, or whatever.
- Mm-hmm.
Um, it's just that there's
this theory going around
that the two of you
are together,
and that's why you're
breaking up with Devin.
And, I just wanted to know
if it was true.
I'm sorry,
that's just...
that's incredibly
inappropriate.
Oh, I...
I didn't mean to be rude.
Okay, here we go.
What is this?
It's apps.
Apps?
Appetizers.
They're super-good.
- Heather, Heather, Heather, here!
- Heather, Heather, here!
- Hey, Heather.
- Heather, here we go!
- Oh!
- Here we go, here we go.
Hey Heather,
how ya doin' tonight?
- You're looking beautiful.
- Okay, Stan, give us some space.
Yeah, how's the love life
now that Devin's out of it?
Hey, Heather, come on,
we know you like to dish.
- Tell us, what's going on?
- I've got nothing to tell you, Stan.
So you're a single lady,
then?
Yup, I'm a single lady.
Come on, Heather!
Hey, ladies.
Wait up, come on.
Hey, Heather, why don't you
let me take you out some time?
I'll take ya any place
you wanna go.
- No thanks, Stan.
- No thanks, really?
Well, what is it? What does
Tracy have that I don't have?
Oh! Look at that? I think
I'm onto something, there.
Well, Tracy Kim is
a very beautiful woman.
- All right, Stan, we're done.
- What do you think?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Okay, remember,
I can either work with you
- or I can work...
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Are you threatening us?
- No, I'm not threatening you.
Okay, are you gonna print
a bunch of bullshit rumors?
No, I'm not gonna print
a bunch of bullshit rumors.
What is your problem?
Get a fucking life.
- What's my problem?
- Get in the car. Come on.
I just feel that Heather's
fans have a right to know.
You are like a vulture, Stan.
A vulture.
No. Listen.
I'm not a fucking vulture.
- Move your coat.
- I'm not the bad guy here.
I'm the good guy.
Remember that.
Who's the boss?
Who's running this show?
There ya go.
Bye-bye.
Have a good night.
What are you doing?
- I'm looking at Instagram.
- No!
- I know, but I...
- Stop! Don't do that!
I just wanna see the photo
that that girl took of me.
I found it.
You already found it?
Okay.
I do not look good.
Don't show me
while I'm driving.
- I would say I look bad to quite bad.
- Okay.
Heather,
where are we going?
"O.M.G., it happened.
Heather Anderson,
heart-eye emoticon."
"Hashtag Heather Anderson.
Hashtag Heather Anderson OMG."
"Hashtag heart Heather."
That is so many hashtags.
All right, Heather,
stop looking at things
on Instagram,
put your phone away,
and tell me where we're going.
- Just keep on going west.
- Okay.
Actually, can we just stop
by your place for a minute?
My place? Why?
'Cause there's just something
there I wanna pick up.
What?
Look, if I tell you what it is,
you won't let us stop.
- What are you talking about?
- I just wanna stop at your place for a minute.
Can we stop at your place
for a minute, please?
Do you have alcohol
at your place?
I have St-Germain.
- From that party?
- Yeah.
- That's all you have?
- That's all I have.
- - Why can't you
be normal and have vodka?
- Comfy?
- This couch is really fucking comfortable.
I know. It should be.
- You gave it to me.
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.
- When?
What do you need
in this apartment?
A drink. Please?
Okay, drinks first.
Drinks, drinks, drinks!
- Ah, the only mixer I have is pineapple juice.
- Ew.
Ooh, I actually have
a Mello Yello.
Ooh!
Why do you have a copy
of Seventeen Magazine?
I don't know.
It just started coming.
That's weird.
I know,
it's really, really weird.
- It's actually really cool.
- Really?
Yeah. It looks exactly
like it did in the '90s.
I don't think
I really read it in the '90s.
Oh, my God, I was obsessed
with these things.
The quizzes,
do you remember the quizzes?
I guess maybe I did
a quiz or two in my day.
Remember
Jonathan Taylor Thomas?
Yeah.
I definitely had my first orgasm
thinking about him.
- What?
- What?
This is very positive.
I'm into this.
Here.
Thank you.
- This is delicious.
- It's delightful.
I love it.
We can't forget
this combination.
Okay, well there's two of us
to remember, so...
Yeah, but you're the one
who remembers things.
Why are we here?
Right.
Okay.
A question for the lady.
All right, milady.
What?
Um...
You have a gun, right?
No.
Okay,
I've seen your gun.
I stole a hair tie from you once
and I saw it.
It's in your bathroom.
- Okay, yes, I have a gun.
- Okay.
Why do you have a gun?
I don't keep it loaded
or anything.
- I just...
- Where'd you get the gun?
I got it when we were
shooting in Utah.
What?
I know it's stupid,
but I felt really not safe
where we were,
and, um,
the props guy, Dave...
- The one who had a crush on you?
- Yeah.
He gave it to me.
Wait, so is it a real gun
or a prop gun?
No, it's a real gun.
- It's a real gun.
- Yeah.
Can I borrow it?
- What are you gonna do?
- I... I'm... Nothing.
I just... I feel like
there's so many crazy people
who are mad at me right now,
you know?
- Yeah...
- And... Okay.
You know how you were just
saying you don't feel safe?
Yeah...
I feel like that
all the time.
You know
how to shoot a gun?
- Jill, how many movies have I shot guns in?
- Two.
Well, yeah,
I know how they work.
Okay, more importantly,
do you know
how to not shoot a gun?
Like, how to not shoot yourself
or anyone else
- when you don't mean to?
- Yes.
I do.
I'm not gonna use it.
I'm 99.99%
not gonna use it.
Okay. Good.
Thank you.
I wanna do karaoke.
Now?
Yeah, like fucking
real, hardcore
K-town karaoke.
I'll call Tracy,
and we'll do
a three-person party.
You guys are okay, right?
Yeah, we're good.
We're good, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
Hi.
I'm going to the cabin
tomorrow.
I'll miss you.
- I'll see you this weekend, right?
- Yeah.
Mm.
Yes?
Someone just took a photo
of me and Tracy.
What?
I saw a flash.
Uh...
did you see who took it?
No, I saw a flash.
Well, um...
I guess
there's nothing more
we can really do
about that now.
It's probably fucking Stan.
Oh, Stan.
Starfish-man.
Stanny the manny.
Are you okay to drive?
♪ When a problem comes along,
you must whip it ♪
What?
Hey, sleepyhead,
no sleeping!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
- Wake up, wake up, wake up!
- You like Tracy, right?
- Yeah.
Are you kidding?
I love Tracy.
- She let me ride her bike.
- Her motorcycle?
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?
Yeah, well,
when I had to pick up
all that stuff last week,
she let me ride it.
She never lets me ride it.
Well, I used to have one
in boarding school.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Got it from a local kid
and I hid it in the woods.
What a delinquent.
- Hey, but, I mean...
- What? What?
Well, I told you
what I think of Tracy,
but what about you?
Do you love Tracy?
I like Tracy.
I like her a lot.
That's good.
- That's really good.
- Yeah.
I'm going to her cabin
this weekend.
- Oo-la-la.
- Oo-la-la!
Okay, eyes on the road.
No crashes.
I'm... Okay, I looked at you
for like two seconds.
Yeah, whatever.
You are not the best driver.
No, I'm not.
I'm terrible.
Yeah, you are terrible.
Do you want a drink?
No.
You wanna stay here tonight?
If that's
all right with you.
- Yeah. I'll make up the guest room.
- No, no, no.
I have to get up early
and go home and change
before the thing.
And if I sleep
in a real bed,
I won't be able to do it.
But the sleep
will be so much better.
Doesn't matter.
Won't be able to get up.
What are you doing?
I'm setting an alarm.
Wait.
Why do you have to get up?
Because I set up the meeting
about that other thing.
What other thing?
The reshoots
that you're not doing.
I totally forgot
about that.
I know.
Jill.
What?
The light came on outside.
Hmm?
The light...
motion sensor light...
came on outside.
Oh.
It's probably just
a coyote or something.
We'll be fine.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
You have to protect me.
I can protect you
in my sleep.
No. You have to protect me
in real life.
I can protect you
with my eyes closed.
Have you seen "Scream"
anytime lately?
Go to sleep.
You know, I haven't forgotten
what we talked about.
When?
Of doing something together,
on our own.
Developing projects
or something like that.
I didn't forget.
I know.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Shit.
Oh...
What happened?
I'm sorry.
- I'm so fuckin' sorry.
- Christ, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine.
I just... I...
- The gun went off.
- The gun went off?
I was...
I was thinking about taking it.
- Why? You were gonna take it?
- I was gonna take it,
and then I decided not to...
and I was putting it back,
- and then I really don't know what happened.
- It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. It's okay.
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.
I broke Devin's coin case.
It's okay.
I hate that stupid
fucking coin case.
Okay.
Now go tell them I don't wanna
do their shitty reshoots.
Hi. It's Heather.
I'll call you back.
Bye.
Hey, I'm coming over
to sort this shit out with you.
And you better have
fucking coffee.
Bye.
Hello?
Heather?
Heather.
Heather.
Jill LeBeau?
I'm Edward Ahn.
I'm the detective
in charge of the case.
Mind if I sit down?
Okay.
Look, I...
I know this isn't easy.
You won't believe me,
but I've felt like
you're feeling right now.
I've felt it and...
I know there isn't much
a stranger like me can say
in a situation like this.
Which is why it's so tough
for me to ask you
what I've gotta ask you.
What do you have to ask me?
I can tell you're smart.
You remember things.
Am I right?
I don't know.
I think you might
remember things
more than most people.
It's just a gut feeling
I have.
I already gave a statement.
You did.
Um, but not to a detective.
Um, that was more of
a paperwork statement,
basic facts.
See, what I'm looking for
is a little different.
I want you to think back
to early this morning.
And what I wanna know about
is what is the last thing
you saw in this house.
In other words,
what was Heather doing
when you walked out the door
the last time you saw her?
She was just looking,
at me.
That's it?
Just looking?
Yeah,
just normal looking.
Mm.
Except she was holding
your .22 snubnose.
Is that right?
Yeah.
So, we could say
it was a little
not quite normal, right?
Well,
the looking was normal.
It's just that she was...
she was holding the gun.
Okay.
She was holding the gun
and looking normal.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Did she ever
threaten you or...?
No,
she didn't threaten me.
'Cause I've heard stories
about movie stars that...
Just trying to construct
a little history.
That's all.
You might not think
something's important,
and then bingo,
it's the key
to the whole thing.
Hi. It's Tracy.
I can't pick up the phone
right now.
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.
Hey, Tracy.
Um...
Just call me back
when you can, okay?
Okay?
Finnegan, Harper and Murphy.
It's Jill.
Put me through to Jamie.
Did she kill herself?
No.
She didn't kill herself.
How do you know?
Because, Jamie,
she was shot five times.
Have you been
to the police yet?
Yeah.
I think they think
I did it.
You... you didn't?
Of course I didn't!
And I'm pretty sure
you didn't.
Hello.
Hello.
Do you have a charger?
No.
You have to put out
a press release
before the police do it.
We have to stay
on top of this.
I can't.
Jamie, come on.
I know you don't wanna
think about this right now
but you have to think about this
right now.
Because what we say
and do right now,
that's what people are gonna
remember about this.
Jamie, I can't do it.
I literally can't do it.
Okay, fine.
I'll take care of it.
Jill,
if she didn't kill herself,
who killed her?
I don't know.
I really can't think
about this right now.
Honestly,
my money's on Greg.
You should've heard
what he said to me
last night.
What did he say to you
last night?
Something to the effect of,
"Jamie, this is killing me."
"I'm going to fucking
kill Heather.
I am going to fucking
kill her."
I'm sure
he was exaggerating.
Well, I don't know,
but I wouldn't be so quick
to cross people off the list.
I didn't kill her,
but you don't know that.
You see what I mean?
I guess.
Look.
I know you and I
kind of hate each other,
but I actually
quite like you.
So I'm asking you
to be careful, okay?
- Goin' somewhere?
- Aah!
Uh, me?
No.
Walk with me.
Have a seat
at the counter.
Okay.
What can I get you?
- You want a coffee?
- No, thanks.
Two coffees,
regular coffees.
Okay.
You didn't answer my call.
My phone died.
Where are you from,
originally?
I don't think
that that's important.
I'm not asking
'cause it's important.
I just wanna know.
Portland.
I'm from Portland.
- Oregon or Maine?
- Oregon.
I haven't lived there
since I was 14, though.
Why not?
Because I went
to boarding school.
Which one?
Um, Exeter.
You always want to be
somebody's assistant?
I mean, back then,
you know, back at Exeter,
what did you wanna be?
I don't see what this all
has to do with Heather.
I'm gonna tell you
three things.
Okay?
All right.
Drink your coffee.
I don't want it.
I said I didn't want it.
Okay, look,
do whatever makes you happy,
but just listen
for a couple of minutes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
All right.
Look, I already know how
you're gonna say
these things
fit with your story,
but here we go anyway.
Number one, your prints
and your prints alone
were on the shell casings.
The .22 had
one other set of prints.
Heather's.
That's it.
No other prints.
You with me so far?
- I think so.
- Good.
Number two,
your hand tested positive
for gunshot residue
underneath the right index
and middle fingernails.
I told you.
I accidentally let off
a shot this morning.
Okay, number three,
by your own admission,
you were there at approximately
the time of death.
'Course there's
a couple of things
I still can't figure.
Like what?
Like the coins.
The coins?
What about them?
They're gone.
I can't figure it.
Unless it's somebody's
clumsy attempt
to make the whole thing
look like
a burglary gone wrong.
Am I under arrest?
Not yet.
Warrant's coming, though.
What? What are you...
What are you looking at?
Stan.
You know this guy?
Hey, Jill.
Yeah, he's paparazzi.
You can't do that.
In the State of California,
you cannot record
a private conversation
without the consent
of all parties
in that conversation.
I'm sure you know that.
Hey, Detective.
Yes?
What happened
to your friend?
Yeah, can I help you?
Oh, my God, it's you.
- Yeah.
- What, uh...
What is this?
What are you supposed to be?
- Nothing.
- Okay.
I do think the police
are looking for you.
So you've heard?
Oh, yeah, I heard.
Can I come in?
Why?
Because I wanna
talk to you.
Okay, fine.
You're gonna have to talk
while I pack.
Pack?
Where are you going?
Goin' to Edinborough.
What's in Edinborough?
Well, for me, nothing.
That's the point.
I don't get it.
Look, 'cause of
your snake of a boss,
there's no more movie.
I gotta get outta
this poisonous town
before I murder someone.
You didn't already,
did you?
You're being glib.
It's not attractive,
and frankly, I'm offended
by the question.
- Well, somebody killed her.
- Yeah, you know what?
I really
don't give a shit.
- Greg, she's dead!
- Yeah.
She's still a fuckin' snake,
and I still
don't give a shit.
You used to like her.
Yeah, well, that's before
she snaked me.
You know how long I've been
working on this movie?
5 years.
You've told me 100 times.
Anyway, she was going
through a hard time.
It had nothing to
do with you.
And who cares,
'cause she's dead!
Okay.
Jesus Christ, I get it.
You made your point.
Don't you think it looks
a little weird
that you're
leaving town?
No. Why?
I mean, I think the police
think you did it, so...
Have they been here?
Yeah, 'bout an hour ago.
I answered
all their questions.
They didn't tell you
to stay around
- or anything like that?
- Nope.
Hey, what d'ya think
I should bring to read?
I don't know
what books you own.
Well,
clearly something escapist.
Do you know anything about, uh,
nautical fiction?
No.
You don't think I killed her,
do you?
You two were like freaky,
fucked up best friends.
People like that
kill each other all the time.
Where were you
at 6:00 this morning?
I was probably crying
or jerkin' off.
Can you be serious
for five seconds?
I didn't kill her.
Okay?
She's still a fuckin' snake,
but I didn't kill her.
And I would never kill her,
no matter how angry
I was at her.
Okay?
Who killed her, Greg?
Isn't it obvious?
Is it?
Okay, look.
I don't wanna speculate,
but if I'm writing
the screenplay,
I'm looking
for three things...
motive, opportunity,
capacity, okay?
The cops think you did it
because of opportunity
and physical evidence,
but forget about that
for a second.
If I'm writing it,
it's obviously Devin.
Right? I mean, motive...
he hates her.
Opportunity...
she lives in a house
that he basically owns.
And capacity...
this is Devin
we're talking about.
The guy's a fuckin' maniac.
Which is exactly why
it's not Devin.
Because it's too obvious.
You know,
all signs point to Devin,
so it can't be him.
You know, maybe it's...
maybe it's Jamie,
or maybe it's me.
But it's not Devin.
You know this is real life, right?
Yeah, look, uh, I'm just
trying to help ya, here.
Okay?
I mean, I'll tell ya
what the real twist would be,
is if it was you.
But, could also just be
some random lunatic, you know,
like a fuckin' crazy superfan
or something.
You know,
I heard that one time.
There was a guy living
in Katy Perry's garage
for like a week.
Can you imagine that?
- What?
- The fucking superfan.
What?
This crazy
fucking superfan...
she came up to us last night
after you stormed out.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
You say that Heather
was at the restaurant
last night?
Well,
she was just outside.
Greg.
Of course she was watching.
She's such a fucking pussy.
It's like
she was actually there,
and she still sent you in
to do the dirty work.
Can I please tell you
about the superfan?
- All right. Fine.
- Okay.
After you left Casa Bianca,
she came up to us,
and she was acting all crazy,
like obsessive.
Obsessive how?
Well, she was asking
all these personal questions,
and she wanted to take
a bunch of pictures.
That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.
- Wait. Just...
Just forget the whole crazy
superfan thing.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
All right?
Could've been Stan.
Who's Stan?
This terrible
paparazzi guy.
Yeah.
What?
Okay, look, um,
just 'cause I gotta leave
in like five minutes,
and for some fuckin' reason
you're standing
in the middle of my bedroom,
you're gonna...
you're gonna see me
get my octopus.
Your octopus?
That's the octopus.
Excuse me.
Who is it?
Okay,
it's the cops again.
Look,
just go out the back, okay?
There's a gate
in the backyard.
And for the record,
the next time
you're gonna put on,
like, a little disguise
or whatever the hell that is,
it would be a lot more effective
if you put it on
after you come around
visiting people like me, okay?
I'm coming!
Jill, it's Tracy.
I was up at the cabin,
and I just got your message.
Um, I'm driving back now.
Call me when you can.
Hey, there,
it's Heather Anderson.
And I just wanted
to call and say
you seemed really cool,
and I liked you.
So, um, you've got the job
if you want it.
Okay, call back. Bye.
Hello?
Nick?
Yeah, this is Nick.
Good, well, then,
maybe you can tell me
what's going on.
Uh, what d'ya mean?
Well, we're here,
and we don't see Devin
anywhere.
Is this
Cassandra's assistant?
Yes.
We've been waiting
for 20 minutes.
He's not already there?
No, Nick.
We're at Bar Marmont,
and I've looked
everywhere.
Bar Marmont?
Yes, I mean,
I just stepped outside,
but I'm telling you,
he's not here.
Well, that's wrong.
Wrong?
Well, then, where is he?
Long day?
Yeah.
Well, one drink,
and all will be groovy.
I guarantee it.
You know what you want?
Um...
If you don't know
what you want,
it means that you want
the voodoo juice.
- Okay.
- Great.
So, wanna talk about it?
Um...
Your bad day?
No. I don't think so.
All right.
Suit yourself.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
I'll be right here.
Jill.
Hey, Devin.
What are you
doing here?
Nothing.
- Are you following me?
- No.
Did you call Nick?
Your assistant?
All right,
cut the bullshit.
I have literally no idea
what you're talking about.
- Really?
- I'm here for a meeting.
With who?
As you know,
this is one of my spots.
In fact, I'm pretty sure
that you started coming here
because I told you this was
a great spot for meetings.
What'd you do
to your hair?
Nothing.
You think I killed her,
don't you?
I don't know
what I think.
Why are you
following me?
I already told you,
I'm not following you.
You think
you understood Heather.
I do understand Heather.
No, you don't.
Where were you last night?
I don't have to answer
your questions.
- Why can't you tell me where you were?
- You know what?
Tell me if Heather
was really with Tracy.
- Why does that matter?
- I wanna know.
Why?
Fuck you, Jill.
- Just like two seconds.
- I don't have the key, so...
- Well, maybe you left on the table.
- Fuckin' left it at the fuckin' bar.
We can get one at the damn desk,
all right?
Okay.
What the fuck?
What?
Why are the lights on?
How should I know?
Sorry.
You're freakin' me out.
Okay, we need to talk about
last night.
Last night?
Were you at home?
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
Why are you asking?
Probably won't even
come up,
but if the police
talk to you
I need you to tell them
that we were together.
When?
Last night,
up until this morning.
When I talked to the police,
I said I spent the night
at your house.
Why did you
tell them that?
I went up to my place in
Joshua Tree last night, alone,
which means
I don't have an alibi.
So, you want me
to lie to the police?
You trust me, right?
Look,
if it was gonna be a big deal,
I wouldn't ask you
to do it.
It's just...
It's gonna make it easier,
okay?
I have to pee.
I wanna take a shower.
If I can take a shower,
I think I'll feel better.
Okay.
You okay?
I dunno.
I want you
to look at something.
- What's this?
- I found it in Devin's hotel room.
They... they were missing
from Heather's house,
and the detective
that I was talking to,
what he thinks is
that someone took them
to make it look like
a burglary gone wrong.
Devin's obsessed
with these things.
How do you know this isn't
another one that he owns?
Oh, I dunno.
I guess I don't.
Everything okay?
Yeah. Fine.
I brought you these.
What are they?
They'll calm you down
and help you sleep.
Don't worry,
I take them all the time.
Oh, God.
I do wanna sleep.
It's okay.
It'll be good to sleep.
I can get her
to come up to the cabin.
No.
She's asleep now.
Yeah.
I just really think
I should bring her up there
before something happens.
Jill.
It's Detective Ahn.
I need you to come in
because we have to talk.
See, what I think is
that you haven't told me
the whole truth.
Um,
I hope you'll call me back.
And I wanted...
"Hashtag Heather Anderson."
"Hashtag Heather Anderson
O.M.G.
Hashtag heart Heather."
That is so many hashtags.
You want this?
No.
I obviously
can't be trusted with it.
You sure?
Hi. It's Tracy.
I can't pick up the phone
right now.
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.
- Looking for me?
- Jesus, fuck!
Hello to you, too.
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew you weren't dead.
Of course
you're not fucking dead!
I'm really happy
you're here.
You killed her,
didn't you?
You must've shot her
in self defense.
What are you doing here?
I was so scared.
I was...
so fucking scared.
And I don't know, maybe I
wanted to disappear anyway.
You know the police
think that I did it?
My prints are on the gun,
and I'm the only one
who they're sure
was at the house.
Okay, but now you can help me,
though.
- I'll go back to sort it out.
- Help you?!
Heather,
I'm the one that needs help.
Okay, yeah, we can do that, too.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, you're always telling me
not to worry about it.
Yeah, because you worry
too much.
I thought that you were dead!
I thought that you were gone!
- The police think that I killed you!
- Okay. I'm sorry.
I know I fucked up.
I'm sorry.
I did a bad thing.
I just...
I knew they'd figure out
it wasn't me who was dead,
eventually.
Yeah,
that's not the fucking point.
Me and Tracy
thought you'd be okay.
Look, we'll stay here tonight,
we'll hang out,
and in the morning
we'll go.
No. It's not fun.
It's not
a fucking sleepover.
Of course it's not fun.
I know it's not fun.
Jill...
Look, I know
it's not a sleepover.
I... I'm sorry.
Look, I know it seems like
I don't get it.
But I do. I get it.
Jill, I'm sorry,
but I need you.
Not as my assistant,
but as my friend.
You're like... you're like
my only fucking friend!
Jill, don't go.
I'll do whatever it takes
to make it up to you, okay?
Just, um...
Just try not to fuck up my face
permanently.
Okay, sorry.
No, no.
Just... just do it.
Do it how you want.
Okay.
Hey.
They're ready for you.
Whenever you are.
I'm not ready.
Yes, you are.
Come in.
Hey, um,
so we're pretty much set,
but Vanessa wanted
to come and talk to Heather
for a moment
before we get started?
Okay. Just a minute.
Thanks.
Come in.
Expecting someone else?
Yeah.
Listen, don't blame
the guys upstairs.
I had to work my badge
pretty hard to get past them.
What are you
doing here?
Can't I stop by
to say hello?
Is everything
all right?
Yes. Yeah. Fine.
There's no problem.
So anyway, I-I...
I heard about this interview,
and I gotta admit,
I was pretty curious
about it.
Curious how?
I know
I could watch on TV,
but, um, listen,
would you mind
if I stuck around
to see it live?
The way I understand it,
a lot of these interviews
wind up
on the cutting room floor,
and I'd like to see
the whole thing.
You know?
I'm sorry.
- Is... is the case closed?
- Yes.
No, the case is closed.
This is entirely
unofficial.
In fact,
it's really up to you.
I'll go if you want,
but I would like to stay.
Uh, just a minute.
So what d'ya say?
You can stay.
Thank you.
I wanna start by saying,
it's good to see you.
I mean it.
It's good to see you,
too.
I remember
when I first met you,
what impressed me so much was
how self-assured you were.
- I think you were 17?
- I was 18.
Well, I can honestly say
that you have not lost
an ounce of grace
over the years.
Thank you.
But now you find yourself
in the aftermath of
a very difficult situation,
one that goes way beyond movies,
well beyond celebrity.
You're right,
this is, um...
- It's real life.
- Yes.
I want you to tell me...
tell me something
you told me
right before
we started today.
I...
I said that nothing
was off-limits.
That's right.
And what about
the legal consequences
of you
speaking with me today?
I care about the truth.
That's why I'm here.
And what is the truth?
This... this girl was...
was in my house.
I was afraid.
Help me understand
what you were thinking
when that girl and you
made eye contact.
