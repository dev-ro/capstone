All right.
My shift's not over till 9:00.
So tell Coach C I'm gonna be
a few minutes late
picking you up, okay?
Okay.
Good luck out there today.
Thanks.
Hey.
You know, if I could,
I would be in those stands
cheering for my baby.
I know. Next game.
Hey, Bron?
You forgetting something?
Love you, Ma.
I love you too, baby.
All right. Go kill it.
What's up, Bron?
What's up, Malik?
Check it out. It's for you.
My dad got me
the new color one.
Oh, and if
it freezes up on you,
just smack it really hard.
- Works every time.
- Thanks, man.
Let's go get this win.
Phew!
Eh, what's up, Doc?
Hey, where Bron at?
LeBron James!
Eh, what's up...
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, snap!
"Oh, snap" nothing, man.
Get your tail on the court
right now! Whatchu doing?
Hey, hey, hey!
Iso! Iso for Bron!
Nobody else shoot the ball.
All right, Bron,
you keep that ball!
You shoot the ball.
- Iso! Iso! Iso!
- You know what to do,
baby. Let's go.
It's your world.
Damn! Damn!
It's all right,
it's all right.
Damn!
Come on, line up.
Line up in front of me.
Line up right here
in front of me.
Listen, man.
I'm not even disappointed
about us
losing the game tonight
'cause it's not about that.
It's about you giving your all,
and you didn't do that tonight.
LeBron.
You wasn't focused.
Getting your head in the game
starts before you even put
one foot on the court.
It starts before you even
get to the gym.
- But everybody on the team plays video game...
- LeBron.
This ain't about everybody,
this is about you.
Listen, you're
the best basketball player
I ever coached.
You could be
a once-in-a-generation talent
if you focus on the game
of basketball and not these
distractions.
You can't be great without
putting in work, right?
You got the chance
to use basketball
to change everything.
For your mom, for you,
for everybody
who you care about.
You want that?
LeBron James
has an NBA body.
Six-seven and a half,
240 pounds...
plus he has got
the complete package.
With the first pick
in the 2003 NBA draft,
the Cleveland Cavaliers
select LeBron James.
There he is
with his mom, Gloria.
And the NBA
Most Valuable Player
goes to...
And this fall, I'm gonna take
my talents to South Beach.
LeBron James
with his first field goal
as a member of the Miami Heat.
The Most Valuable
Player trophy
of the 2012 NBA Finals.
The 2013 NBA Championship
resides once again in Miami!
I will not just shut up
and dribble.
We in the White House
right now. This is like...
Mom, I made it.
LeBron James
is going back to Cleveland.
I'mma do
what makes my city happy.
I love you. I'm back!
LeBron James
makes a great American story.
Oh, blocked by James!
It's over!
Cleveland!
This is for you!
LeBron James
is a Los Angeles Laker.
Here comes LeBron!
My goodness,
that's the stuff
that dreams are made of.
Two seconds to go.
James, a buzzer beater!
You bet!
So how much more work
does your video game need?
It's been months.
It's almost ready.
Like how you're
almost ready to tell Dad
about the E3 Game Camp
next weekend?
I'm waiting on the right time.
Honestly, I just think
you should rip
the Band-Aid off and ask him.
You're just saying that
'cause he says yes
to everything you ask.
That's 'cause I'm nice.
- You're not that nice.
- That's big talk.
See if you can back it up.
Come on,
let's see what you can do.
All right.
Don't get crossed.
Oh! Gotcha!
Yeah, okay.
Come on, bro.
Dom.
What was that?
An open shot.
And if you're gonna be
out here,
it's about giving everything
that you got.
And not whatever that was.
Where's your fundamentals?
We having fun.
Everything in between
these four lines
is work.
Who said I wasn't working?
This thing right here.
Told you not to bring
that out here.
Come on, Dom.
This isn't a game.
I need you focusing more...
...instead of playing
with these toys.
Darius, chill out.
You know
I got full court vision.
How does he do that?
Ball.
Show me that step-back move
I taught you.
You got this, son.
- In and out. Crossover.
- In and out.
Step back.
Come on, Dom.
You gotta concentrate.
Darius, show him the move.
Watch me.
Ball.
In and out. Crossover.
Step back. Shoot.
Yep. See,
that's 'cause your brother
been putting in that work.
I ball all day.
Ow!
Dom. Focus.
You got basketball camp
next weekend.
Them boys gonna be coming
at your neck.
Seeing what you got.
Oh, we quitting
on each other now?
Can't be great
without putting in work.
All right. That's my guy.
Let's get some work done.
Enough of these games.
Okay. I'm ready.
Boys!
Y'all can't stay out here
all day.
It's dinnertime.
Oh, man.
Really, Bron?
What are we having for dinner?
Spaghetti and meatball?
Ow!
- Ooh, that's my favorite.
- Damn!
We talked about you
affirming Dom more.
Spending some
unstructured time with him.
We was just outside.
I mean,
how much more spontaneous
do you want me to be?
Babe, I am worried
that you are pushing him
too hard.
I mean,
the kid keep telling me
he want the best coaching
so he can be the best player
on the court.
Have you thought
about talking to your son
about something
other than basketball?
Like what?
Like how Dom
built a video game.
He's 12
and he built his own game.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, that's great.
I mean,
but if I don't push him,
if I don't stay on him,
- all the distractions...
- He doesn't need a coach.
He needs his dad.
LeBron James, a hit.
- James...
- LeBron James...
I've searched far and wide
for the perfect partner
for this launch,
and I've finally found him.
LeBron James.
Pete, he's a family man,
an entrepreneur,
a social media superstar
with millions of fans
worldwide.
Algorithmically speaking,
he's more than an athlete.
He's a king.
Hmm?
I know I'm just
an algorithm, Pete.
That's precisely
why I need King James.
I'm stuck
inside the Serververse.
No one knows who I am
or what I do.
But that all changes today.
Because today,
Warner Bros. launches
the revolutionary technology
that I masterminded.
Today,
it's my time to shine.
Just look at this guy, Pete.
Oh, he is the key element
to this entire operation.
Once I partner with King James
and combine his fame
with my incredible tech...
I will finally get
the recognition and respect
that I so richly deserve.
LeBron James, get ready.
Oh, hello.
A new idea from the algorithm.
I'm listening.
Hey, son.
What you doing?
Um, just building my game.
Is this the one
you've been working on?
Actually, it's basically done,
but I...
Here. Just...
I still have to figure out
some of the player designs.
Whoa.
Who are those guys?
Oh, those are
people around the world
tuning in to my livestream.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Okay.
And this is how it works.
You do combos and moves,
and the better you do,
the more people tune in.
Let me see
a couple of those combo moves.
Crossover. Foul line!
Oh, that was nice.
- Ooh! Posterized!
- Posterized?
Is this not real basketball?
Well, I put a spin to it.
You can get style points.
- Power-ups.
- Count it!
It's like basketball,
but better.
You just play for fun.
Remember fun, Dad?
Tsk. I am fun.
Man, give me that.
Show you how fun I am.
Kick your butt in this game.
Dang, I miss this, man.
I ain't...
- Whoa.
- Gimme dat!
Were you trying
to do my move?
Yeah, I put it in the game.
In and out.
Crossover. Step back.
Let it go.
Uh-oh!
No.
Why... Why he freeze?
No, no, no.
Man, can you fix it?
'Cause I don't want...
Hey, don't try
to blame me for that.
No. No, no.
Don't erase my char...
My entire character is gone.
It's gonna take me at least
a week to rebuild this.
Listen, son.
Setbacks happen.
Adversity is a part of
the process, man.
But if you're passionate
about something,
you gotta learn
how to push through it.
You got me?
Hey, I think
I've got something
that will cheer you up.
I'm meeting at Warner Bros.
about some
high-tech movie thing.
You should come. Cool?
Yeah, Dad.
Oh, snap.
Did Dad just come up
with a dope idea?
Please don't dab.
Oh, what'd you just say?
Did you just say,
"Please, Dad, dab"?
- No, I said...
- Dab.
Uncle Malik will be here
in 15. Let's roll.
It's called Warner 3000
and it's supposed to be
next level!
This could be the new wave!
Hello. I'm Al G. Rhythm.
And as you might have guessed,
I am an algorithm
here at Warner Bros.
The studio
behind all the classics.
But now, it's time for
our greatest creation yet,
Warner 3000.
This will revolutionize
the entire
entertainment industry,
and we want you
to be on our team, King James.
Now, we know you're busy,
but we can make it
very easy for you.
Because our brand new
Warner 3000 technology
will scan you
right into the movies.
Oh, it's like looking
into a mirror, huh, LeBron?
Think about it,
Batman versus LeBron.
LeBron of Thrones.
LeBron
and the Chamber of Secrets.
The possibilities are endless.
You'll be
the king of Warner Bros.
That's the power
of Warner 3000.
Say yes, LeBron, and together,
we'll make mind-blowing
entertainment
forever.
Huh? Huh?
So, what do you say?
Pretty sweet, right?
I mean, look at him.
Look at that face.
He's speechless.
He loves it!
How about that algorithm, huh?
Pretty brilliant.
He came up
with the entire presentation.
I should watch my back.
Yes! Thank you! Finally, huh?
Put some 'spec
on my name, right?
Oh, man.
That was, um...
That was something.
Right, Malik?
Listen, guys,
I'm a ballplayer.
You know,
and athletes acting,
that never goes well.
I'm sorry, guys.
This is all just...
It's just not me.
And I can't afford to take
time away from the game.
Whoa, Bron.
- Let's not be too hasty here.
- Malik.
Let's just hear
what they're talking about.
Nah, nah, nah.
With all due respect,
with all due respect,
this idea
is just straight-up bad.
That algorithm is busted.
Busted?
It's among the worst
ideas I've ever heard.
Top five, easily.
Okay. Thank you. Thank you!
That's exactly
what I was think...
You're saying
what I'm thinking.
This is trash, this algorithm.
You're cancelled, algorithm!
What a terrible idea.
So stupid.
So stupid.
This is what happens when...
Pete, tell me he did not
just say "stupid"!
Uh-oh.
I don't know. I think
the algorithm's pretty cool.
I've got a question.
Is it a heuristic algorithm
or some kind of
matrix variant?
Dom,
using the medulla oblongata.
I think we got a little
Stevie Jobs on our hands.
Yeah, I'm actually building
my own video game.
Oh, nice, your own video game.
You heard of the E3
Game Design Camp, right?
Yeah.
Well, there's gonna be one
next weekend, and I'm going.
There's gonna be a whole bunch
of other coders there.
Hold... Dom.
I'm actually
looking forward...
No. You can't go to that.
Basketball camp
is next weekend.
I'm not going
to basketball camp, Dad.
Dom, you don't
have to be scared.
You got amazing potential
on the court,
and I can help you get there.
That's not what I want, Dad.
Dom.
Wonderful to meet...
Excuse me, guys.
Dom!
Hey, hey, I'mma catch you
at the car.
What?
So, is this a hard pass or...?
Who does
this guy think he is? Huh?
Rejecting me? Humiliating me?
Okay.
All right.
I tried being a team player,
but those days are over.
I'm done playing
by everybody else's rules.
It is my game now.
Dom!
I'm your father.
When I say stop, you stop.
Right this way,
King James.
Dom,
do not get in that elevator!
Come on, Dom.
You know I can't let you
back out of camp like that.
You made a commitment.
You make me hate basketball.
- You don't mean that.
- I do.
Everything is always
what you want.
You never let me do
what I wanna do.
You never let me just do me.
"Do me"?
You think I got to "do me"
when I was 12?
Hold up. Wrong floor.
Warner 3000.
Welcome, Dominic James.
Wow, this is cool.
Dom?
Stop playing, man.
You know
your mom don't like it
when I don't have you home
for dinner on time.
All this computer stuff
is your thing, not mine.
Dom?
Dom!
Dom?
What in The Matrix hell?
Dom! What's going on?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Wow.
This must be
some kind of immersive tech
like holography
with haptic technology,
or something like VR...
Dude, dude, dude.
Just tell me what's going on.
Dad, I think we're digitized.
- We're in the computer!
- We're in the computer?
- Dad.
- You know I'm claustrophobic.
- Dad, chill out.
- How do we get out of here?
- Dad. Dad.
- Where's the elevators?
Hey, Siri, can you let us
out of here, please?
Siri?
Who goes there?
Who dares disturb the great
and powerful Al G.?
Look at your faces.
You were terrified!
Priceless.
See? Nothing to be afraid of.
The computer's Black.
I can see that.
Hello.
Hi.
Wow. King James.
I am a big fan.
I just...
I don't know, I thought
you'd be taller somehow.
Hmm.
- These graphics are unreal.
- Right?
Dom, don't touch
the silver computer man.
What's going on?
- And who are you, man?
- Uh...
You're right. Forgive me.
Where are my manners?
I am King Al G. Rhythm.
Oh, you're that guy
from the video.
Yes, I am.
And this... Ha-ha.
Oh, gentlemen, this...
this is
the Warner Bros. Serververse.
Just make you feel
all insignificant, don't it?
Are all computers like this?
Dom?
- Dom?
- Uh-oh.
What'd you do to my son?
Where's Dom?
Who's Dom?
Dude, chill out.
You're gonna get
your son back.
There better not be a "but"
at the end of...
But there's something
you're gonna do for me first.
Like what?
You know, you, uh...
You really shouldn't have
rejected my ideas back there.
That was a mistake.
Now, I'm afraid you're gonna
have to help me
fulfill my destiny.
Listen, man,
if you don't produce my son
in five seconds...
Eh-eh! Uh-uh. No, no, no.
All that pointing
and aggression.
No, no, no. You're not
running things in here.
I am the king of this domain.
I'm not your coach.
Now, the only way you're
getting your son back
is if you and I play a little
game called basketball.
You wanna play me
in basketball?
Well, you didn't wanna be
in the movies.
You wanted to
"focus on your game."
Well, guess what?
Now you can focus
on this game.
You and me, we're gonna
put on a show, baby.
We are gonna play a game
of basketball
in front of the largest
captive audience ever.
All your followers,
they're all gonna be watching.
And when they see
the two of us together,
I will finally step out
of the shadows
and into the light.
And the entire world
is gonna know
the name of King Al G. Rhythm.
But you know what,
I'm a good sport.
Tell you what, if you win,
you and your son can
skedaddle on out of here.
And what if I lose?
Yeah. Wrinkle.
If you lose...
Well, when you lose,
you're just gonna
have to stay here
in the Serververse with me...
forever and ever and ever
and ever.
Oh!
So, you better play
like you mean it.
You know,
you think this is a game.
I'm calling
the authorities on you.
'Cause what you got
going on here...
On this phone?
How'd you do that?
LeBron, why are you worried
about the authorities
when you should be out there
looking for a team?
Pete, send this clown
to the rejects.
Wait...
I guess he fell for it.
Here's looking at you, kid.
No, no, no, no, no!
What is happening?
I'll get you, my pretty.
No, no,
no, no, no, no!
What is this?
I'm shorter than Kevin Hart!
No, no, no!
What the...? I'm a cartoon?
Is this where the game
is gonna happen?
Where is everybody?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
"Rabbit season"?
What the...?
Ahh! Get away!
Leave me alone!
Somebody help!
What's up, Doc?
Duck season!
Bugs Bunny?
Whoa!
Bugs! I can't believe...
Bring it in, man.
Listen, I need your help.
Eh, you missed your cue.
Oh. Rabbit season.
All right, here. Now say,
"I'm huntin' wabbits..."
...and try to chase me.
Bugs, wait!
Come back!
I should've seen that coming.
Coming through!
Say, have I seen you
somewhere?
Hey, you're that famous
basketball guy.
Come on,
aren't you LeBron James?
Bugs Bunny knows who I am?
Of course.
I may live
in a hole in the ground,
but we still get TNT.
Oh, my God, is that a...?
Yep. Cover your ears, Doc.
Why would you do that?
I'm a Tune, Doc.
I can survive anything.
I'm not a Tune!
No, no, no! Ahhh!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
I do not understand
this world.
Eh, my bad, Doc.
How long
have you been alone here?
Alone? You're never alone
when you got friends
like mine, Doc.
- Ain't that right, Porky?
- Uh...
That's just
a pile of pumpkins.
Porky, did you hear
what he just called you?
So, what brings you
to Tune World, Doc?
Torn meniscus?
Midlife crisis?
Ran out of teams to play for?
Uh... All I know is a computer
dude kidnapped my son,
and I have to play basketball
to get him back.
His name is Al G. Rhythm?
Did you say Al G. Riddim?
Yeah, that's the guy.
Rhythm, Riddim...
Whatever.
That nefarious nimrod
nixed my nearest and dearest
from Tune World.
He kicked them out?
Well, not exactly.
He buttered them up,
saying they were
wasting their time.
That there was
much more to see
in the Serververse
than old Tune World.
Made 'em turn their backs on
who they really were.
They all left, all of them.
And I wish them all the best
in their new endeavors.
Ah, man. Sorry, Bugs.
That's terrible.
Family's everything.
Yep.
Family.
Well, Bugs Bunny,
I need to assemble
an elite team
of A-plus ballplayers
to help crush this Al G. guy.
And I need to do it before
that game clock runs down.
Hol... Hold up, Doc.
So, you want me,
a talking cartoon bunny,
to play with you,
an NBA superstar,
in a high-stakes
basketball game?
Sounds awfully familiar.
Who are you talking to?
But, yeah,
that actually sums it up well.
Mmm. I think I know a way
that can help the both of us.
I declare this land
for planet Earth.
Not so fast, furry creature.
Excuse me.
Marvin the Martian?
For real?
I claim this planet
in the name of Mars.
My goodness.
My mistake, partner.
I thought this land
was in the clear.
Well, we'll just get back
in our ship
and out of your way.
Oh, it's quite all right.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Come on. Let's boogie.
What? You're stealing his
ship. I didn't agree to this.
My ship!
Blasted rabbit.
Whoa, whoa!
Bugs! Help! Help! Whoa!
Take this, rabbit.
Back at ya.
Huh?
You coming, Doc?
Or would you rather hang back
with a cranky Martian
and his space mutt?
Just watch out for the...
Just watch out for the...
I just said, watch out for...
Bugs!
You have
made me very angry.
Very angry, indeed.
This place is awesome.
It really is.
Wait, where's my dad?
Your dad?
Oh! He's out there
looking for a team.
- A team?
- Yeah.
He challenged me
to a basketball game.
I mean, that's weird, right?
He just left?
Kind of his M.O., right?
I mean, he left Cleveland,
he left Miami.
He left Cleveland again.
Look out, Lakers, huh?
Come on,
don't look so sad, Prince.
I mean, you don't need
your old man
bossing you around anyway.
Look at where you are.
This is the greatest view
in the entire Serververse.
Your old man is missing out.
It is pretty amazing.
Who built this?
Well, someone brilliant.
Visionary.
Incredibly good looking.
Modest.
With a multitudinous
vocabulary.
Hint, you're looking
right at him, kid.
But all
my extraordinary gifts,
they're nothing
compared to yours.
Yeah, right.
It's true, Dom.
I saw you back there
in that boardroom
through some camera-phones,
and a printer,
and a fax machine,
and a thermostat.
It's very clear
how smart you are.
And Pete tells me
that you hate video games.
You create video games.
Why don't you enunciate?
How many times do we
have to go through this?
I'm the problem?
Get out of here.
Get out of here!
Sorry.
Heard you made
your own character, too.
Yeah, but he got deleted
because of some stupid glitch.
Ah, don't worry about that.
We can rebuild him.
- You could?
- Absolutely.
Make him greater than he was.
You wouldn't
even have to lift a finger.
There's a shortcut for
everything in the Serververse.
What?
Aw.
Thinking of your dad again,
huh? How he's always...
"You can't be great
without putting in work."
Yeah. How did you know that?
I know a lot about you, Dom.
Any device with a camera,
I can see you.
If it's got a mic,
I can hear you.
Hey, let's get a look
at that game of yours.
Captain's log,
Captain James T. Bunny.
Intergalactic space traveler
on a five-year mission.
My crew has been scattered
to the far, far reaches
of the Serververse.
Marooned on strange,
inhospitable worlds.
I've commandeered
Marvin's ship in an effort
to reassemble the team.
Yo, Bugs.
Check it out.
Look what I found.
Oh, that's not good.
Were you saying something?
Uh, I was just asking you...
Hey, what's that for, Doc?
Gotta make a list.
We're gonna need
the most powerful
Warner Bros. characters
for this team.
Now, let's see.
Who to get? Hmm.
Gotta start with Superman.
Man, I could've used him
on the Cavs.
Ooh. King Kong.
He'd be a beast on the boards.
Yeah, listen, Doc...
Try not to get your hopes up
too much.
You might not be able to get
all those top guys
for the team.
This ain't the Miami Heat,
you know.
We're gonna need
a strong power forward.
Iron Giant.
Put him on the same team
as his hero, Superman.
I'm just saying
it might be good
to have a backup plan.
Wow.
This Serververse is massive.
So many different worlds
to explore.
I wish Dom was here
to see this.
So, how come you stayed
on Tune World?
Tune World is my home.
It's the only place
where I can be me.
- Where I belong.
- Yo!
Is that Harry Potter World?
Awesome!
Hufflepuff? I knew it!
Nerd alert.
Oh, yeah! Metropolis.
I can't wait to see
what I turn into here.
Oh, it's gonna be
somebody dope.
Robin? I'm freaking Robin?
And why are we chasing
a runaway train?
We're in DC World, Doc.
And where there's trouble,
- there's superheroes.
- Whoa!
Hmm?
Gadzooks!
Some despicable villain
tied up the driver.
Yeah, sorry.
Unless someone
stops this thing,
it'll crash straight into...
...an orphanage. Of course.
This is not good.
Luckily, Super Duck
is here to save the...
Cut!
What are you
doing here, rabbit?
Say, we need a couple of guys
to win a basketball game.
Hold up, you want these guys?
Basketball?
Are you kidding me?
This stunt here
is gonna get me
into the Justice League
penthouse!
With free parking.
And now, the hero,
Super Duck, who is me,
will pull this brake,
and save the day.
That's all, folks.
Whoa!
The... The children!
Huh?
Uh, we did it?
Oh, no, you don't, rabbit.
I did this. It was me.
I masterminded
this entire operation.
It was me!
It was him.
It was definitely the pig.
Yeah, what?
Any of you
play any basketball?
You know, on second thought,
I love basketball!
Dibs on coach.
All right, we're off to a...
decent start.
But now we gotta crew up,
build our elite squad
so I can get my son back.
And that's exactly
what we'll do.
It's draft day.
Beep, beep.
- Witness!
- Witness!
Beep, beep.
This guy?
Yeah. He's explosive.
Beep, beep.
I know what you need.
You need a player.
- Yeah.
- Beep, beep.
Yeah, baby! Yeah!
He is exactly
like you in every way.
Except 1/8th your size.
Sylvester, is that you?
Sufferin' succotash!
What are you doing here?
Can we
just get some players
who are at least tall enough
to ride a roller coaster?
Sing it, Sam.
Ooh. You got baggage, lady.
I can relate.
♪ You must... ♪
What? What?
Oh, come on, man.
Well, with the hat on,
he's at least 4'2".
4'3", varmint!
Bugs, I'm getting the feeling
that I need to be
very literal with you.
We're done running tests
on your badger thing.
It turns out
his condition is irreversible.
I'll never erase
what I saw from my brain.
He's your problem now,
dum-dums!
Yo, Bugs,
does this thing bite?
Winter, I say,
winter is coming!
You know what we're missing?
Everything.
We're missing everything.
Some veteran leadership?
You read my mind.
Police!
Hands on your head!
Can't a lady
check her Twitter?
Abuela, let's do this.
What's happenin', bro?
Arriba! Arri...
Mi sombrero!
Epa! Epa-epa!
Neo ain't got nothing
on me, bro.
Oo-hi-yah!
Oh.
Hi-yah! Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-yay!
What did I miss?
Hey, Granny.
Speedy.
All right, everybody.
Group picture.
So, uh,
has anybody seen Tweety?
What year is this?
- Man! You got smelly.
- Gross!
- You're kidding, right?
- Oh, Tweety!
This is not the team
I asked for.
Relax, Doc.
This is the team
you wanna go up against Al G.
Okay, everyone,
say cheese.
Best team
in the whole wide Serververse.
Mother...
Fine.
But you gotta get me at least
one real ballplayer, Bugs.
Just one.
Well, I got just the player
you need.
A true friend of the court.
Trust me, she ain't busy.
Lola! Lola! Lola!
Today will be
the most challenging day
of your life, Lola Bunny.
You have earned the right
to become one of us.
But first, you must pass
these final trials.
I'm ready, Princess Diana.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
- Pardon me.
- Down in front!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Ow!
That was my toe! Watch it!
There she is. Lola!
Lola! Lola!
You must complete
all the obstacles
before time runs out.
Begin!
Giddyap!
Whoa!
Hey, Lola,
we need your help.
We gotta play
a basketball game!
Ow! Ow!
Listen, I know
it's been a while, but...
I'm kind of busy here!
I got this!
Come on, Lola,
this is our big chance.
This is LeBron James.
How often do you get to play
with an NBA superstar?
Been there, done that!
Huh.
That's a good point.
But basketball
is who you are, Lola.
Uh-oh.
I don't play anymore.
I spent years
training for this.
Do not mess it up for me.
Sorry, Doc.
I guess she is busy.
We can't die here!
I have to save my son!
What?
Calm down, Cleveland.
I got this.
Lola, we need your help!
This lava is gonna be
really hot!
I...
I failed.
A warrior is judged
not only by her skills,
but by her values.
You are now an Amazon.
I am?
I am!
Now, go with your friends.
Help them win
this battle of the baskets.
I will help you
deliver justice
to the one they call Al G.,
and save the son of The Bron.
- Hey, guys!
- Lola!
Hi, Lola.
Good to see you!
Yo, Bugs, you coming?
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.
Yeah, Bugs! Here we go.
Nah, nah.
Oh, I got the ball. Let's go.
- No.
- I got you now.
Oh. Ah.
Dunk-tastic!
You dunked on me? Man...
I still can't believe you made
this by yourself, Dom.
I mean,
people need to see this.
You're not just a prince,
you're a wizard.
Come here.
Wow.
That's Diana Taurasi.
How'd you build her?
- Yo, Dame!
- What's good, bro?
Dad hooked me up
with some of his friends
at an NBA charity event.
I thought
maybe they could help me
with the character designs
for my game.
Game?
Yeah, I'm building
a video game.
Okay.
You know you're gonna
need a shooter,
- and I'm that dude, so...
- Wait a minute.
I'm next, because if Klay's
in it, then I'm in it.
Hey, if I'm gonna be
in this game,
I need a superpower
or something.
Between me and you,
I need one of those
special modes.
And we can call it
"Dame Time."
Nah, time's up. Time's up.
You guys can be
whatever you want.
It was great.
They really helped me out.
Stored all the scans
right on my phone.
This phone?
So, theoretically,
this app of yours
can scan people in
from anywhere in the world,
using their own phones.
Yeah, I guess.
That is sick.
Pete!
Check this out.
Make sure he gets it
back though, it's his.
And respect his privacy.
Gotta say, though,
it's really a shame that
your dad doesn't support you.
I mean, I get it.
He's one of the greatest
of all time at what he does.
Well, the jury's still out
on that, I think,
but go ahead.
And I... build video games.
Mmm.
I think he doesn't...
He won't let me do me.
He won't let me be me.
I'd let you be you.
You know what?
I think I know a way
we can fix this.
We're gonna
make your dad stand up
and take notice of you,
young prince.
Ball.
I need us to focus
so we can beat this Al G. guy,
and I can get my son back.
I'm coach,
I'll take it from here.
The dictionary
defines basketball
as a game
played between
two teams of five.
Uh, look here, Cleveland.
We got a certain way
of doing things around here.
Let's start
with the basics.
Lola, show 'em how we do it.
You're despicable.
Simplest shot in the game.
- Sufferin' succotash!
- Oh, wow!
Nice layup.
That's fundamental basketball.
Fundamental basketball.
That's what I've been saying.
Sam, shoot the ball.
Let's try that again,
shall we?
Ooh!
Come back here, you.
Whoo-hoo!
What the...?
I say, I say, hi-ho, Silver!
Yee-haw!
Ow!
Ball hogs.
Hey! I'm open!
Go, Tunes!
Here I go.
Taz, no!
Whoa!
Ay! Diablo loco!
Let me show you how it's done.
Three-point land!
Where'd she get the ramp?
In your face!
This isn't real basketball.
You're right. But it's fun!
You remember fun,
don't you, Doc?
Game, Blouses! What?
You lost LeBron James?
And his son? For real?
You better find that dude.
He on my fantasy team.
I didn't lose LeBron,
so stop saying that!
Oh, come on, man.
Listen, his wife keeps calling
me every ten minutes.
Now, I gotta get back
to her soon
or she gonna kill me, man.
Look, does my name badge say,
"LeBron Finder"?
"LeBron Locator"?
No, it doesn't.
But isn't it your job
to secure something?
With all due respect,
I went to school
for six months
to be accredited
as a security specialist,
specializing
in the securial arts.
And the sooner
you come to terms
with the fact that you lost
the world's greatest athlete,
the sooner you'll be able
to move on with your life.
I'm a professional!
An avid professional, man!
I ain't lose LeBron,
and I ain't ask you
about your...
Hey, Kamiyah.
Yeah, I got the funniest story
to tell you.
Oh, snap!
I gotta call you back.
I'm driving through a canyon
right now.
He ain't in no canyon.
He in my office,
violating my personal space!
I'm driving through a canyon
right here!
He need to get back on his
business and find LeBron.
Code ten! Code ten!
- You... I can't hear...
- Malik.
You have zero seconds
to tell me
where my husband
and my son are.
Okay, young prince,
time to rebuild
your character.
Al, have you
done this before?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I upgrade things all the time.
I mean, look at Pete,
for instance.
He was hideous, now he's
adorable. Right, Pete?
Ugh. Don't...
Don't look at Pete, okay?
Just focus on yourself.
That's the character
customization menu
from my game.
Yes, it is. Now, with this,
you can become the player
that your dad
always wanted you to be.
Best part is,
you get to do it your way.
You have control.
Seventy-five?
You're good with 75?
Come on! We didn't come here
to be three-quarters.
Pete's a 75,
he can't even rebound.
Come on, Dom. Let's go.
Dream big, son. Turn up.
Turn up.
That's it. Now you're living.
Let's go! Yes!
Ha-ha! Yes.
Now, you are finally gonna be
who you really are.
Captain of my basketball team.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Take it. Swish!
Watch me do it.
Come on, Pete.
Running man on 'em. Whoo!
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Running man on 'em. Huh?
You said we were rebuilding
my character.
You never said anything
about me
actually playing in the game.
Look, do you want your dad
to respect you or not?
- Yeah, but...
- No, Dom. No buts.
You want
your dad to respect you,
you beat him in a game
of your own creation.
Dads don't understand
reason, Dom.
They understand power.
You take the power.
You gotta make him
respect you.
You make him see
that you are special.
Do it. Upgrade me.
Yeah! Feel it!
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Yo! I got handles!
You got mad handles.
There's no way
we're gonna get beat now.
Hey, how about we show
your teammates some love?
Have some fun with it.
And remember, Dom,
no rules, okay?
Forget about fundamentals.
Okay. I think I can make
a few customizations.
Ooh.
I'm sure you can.
And now Bron
won't answer my calls
or texts or anything.
It's almost like...
It's almost like they were
abducted, all right?
What?
Now, we gotta rule out
all possibilities here.
Now, I'm talking about aliens,
okay? The government.
Uh, the New York Knicks.
Guys, guys. Dad just tweeted.
- Thank God! About what?
- Okay.
Said he's playing
in a game later today.
- Is that Dom?
- Yeah. Some kinda...
Game?
...epic live event that
you can stream on this app.
Weird.
I just had
a thought, okay?
Now, if he's tweeting
from his phone right now,
then that means you can...
I can track him on my phone.
That's what I was gonna say.
Pre-game ritual?
I like to remind myself who
I'm playing for. My family.
And right now,
it's all about Dom.
We'll get your son back.
I promise.
Ooh! My ship!
Finally I shall get my...
Wow! Isn't this great?
We're all back together.
Come on, Tunes.
We gotta get to work.
Move it or lose it, rabbit.
Jeez, can't a guy stop
and smell the roses?
A little help here?
Uh, well... Oh, I...
Okay, one more time.
In and out, crossover,
step back, shoot.
Ooh, that's some fancy
footwork, Doc. Let me try.
Okay. Stop!
Can't touch this!
What the...? Really?
Look, Bugs, you already got
what you wanted.
Your friends, Tune World.
I still need my son back.
Outside these lines,
be as looney as you want.
But inside, you do what I say.
Oh, I see.
You're that kind of king.
Look, Bugs,
it's my way or the highway.
Uh... Guys?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Fundamentals
win championships.
Uh-oh.
He's here.
Go! Go! Get out of the way!
I say,
shake a leg, Granny!
Watch out!
I got you, pajarito!
Huh?
Well, if it isn't
the old-news Looney Tunes.
Looking just as washed up
as ever.
You know what?
I think it's time
for an upgrade.
An upgrade?
No!
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Lola!
What in the world?
I say, I say,
cock-a-doodle-doo...
not do that.
I look expensive!
What's happening?
Oh, no!
Oh, they're alive! Alive!
Oh, yeah. You're looking
sharp, Looney Tunes.
Al G.,
this means war.
Whatever, Bugs.
Where's my son?
Oh, now you wanna be
Daddy of the Year?
Just calm down, LeBron.
He'll be here, okay?
We got bigger fish to fry.
Let's get some butts
in these seats!
How big are these butts?
Yabba Dabba Doo!
Hey, Boo-Boo!
Hey, yo,
he's probably in here.
Don't be scared. Come on.
Welcome, James family.
No, Xosha. Wait.
Ladies first.
- Really?
- No?
All right. I'mma go first
'cause I'm a gentleman.
Uh-huh.
Bron?
Bron?
It says he's in here.
Dad?
Dom?
Bron?
Where's the other half
of the crowd?
Uh, they should be tuning in
to the livestream
right about...
Right about...
Right about...
Buffering!
So embarrassing.
Right about now!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's it.
It's game time!
Yo.
It's game time!
Hey, look here.
It's game time!
I say, I say, how in the world
did he get
all these spectators here?
I don't know, but the line
for the bathroom's
gonna be insane.
And we're back
from commercial and...
Where are we?
Lil Rel?
Man,
what are you doing here?
Wait, Ernie Johnson?
This is crazy!
Look, I was
on my phone, right,
and I was getting
on the elevator...
Wait a minute, did I fall down
the elevator shaft?
Ernie, are we dead?
Is this
what heaven looks like?
No, it looks like
we're in some kinda
computer-generated
basketball game.
It looks like
Dad's game's starting.
What? Let me see that.
Oh, Bron, Bron.
Who's this guy?
Got some VIPs coming in.
No!
Yeah!
What a twist!
No, we shouldn't
be watching that.
Where is he?
Where is this coming from?
Something's
not right here.
It's game time!
What?
Whoa, what in the world?
Mommy, what just happened?
Oh, my God! Kids!
Bron!
Babe, what is going on?
Where's Dom?
I don't know, but I have to go
to play this game
- to save everyone with...
- Bugs Bunny?
Uh...
What's up, Doc?
That's kinda normal
around here.
Dad, this is Dom's game.
You know how to play, right?
It's basketball. Of course!
Yeah.
Uh, excuse me?
Paging Mr. LeBron James!
Everything's
gonna be all right.
I promise.
Zap me into you.
Sorry,
I didn't understand that.
I said, zap me, into you.
Zap me, human,
into you, phone.
Zap me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a warm welcome
to your host for the evening,
Mr. Al G. Rhythm!
Hey, how y'all doing?
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,
welcome to the first and final
Serververse Classic!
Oh! Let me tell you what.
I know that you all
are LeBron's biggest fans.
And the King has had
a great run, hasn't he?
But that's over.
That's done now.
And it is time for a new king
to take the throne.
This dude is a hater.
Haters gonna hate.
- He's a bad guy.
- Big time.
So let's lay down
some basic ground rules.
If King James wins,
you all get to go back
to your regular, boring lives.
But if my team wins,
you all get to stay with me
in the Serververse
forever.
What?
How 'bout that, huh?
What? That wasn't the deal.
Oh, yeah! Didn't see
that coming, did you?
Well, at least we're good.
Oh, boy.
Oh, and I almost forgot,
all of the Tunes
will be deleted, so...
Oh, no!
- Deleted?
- That is messed up!
- That dude is bad.
- Why?
You just couldn't keep
your big beak shut.
Blabbermouth.
I deserved that.
And now, from the beautiful
mind of Dominic James...
Introducing...
the Goon Squad!
Whoo!
White Mamba!
What's up?
Wet ball, baby!
Wet Fire!
Arachnneka!
Queen of the web. Mwah.
And The Brow.
Flyest guy on the squad.
Dang!
What'd they do to my boy, AD?
And this next young
man I'm bringing up...
Oh, my goodness.
Y'all gonna love him.
He puts the G in genius.
He's my hero
on the ones and zeroes,
Mr. Dominic James!
Dom!
Give it up one more
time for Dominic James!
Dom!
Dom!
I don't think he can hear you.
I'm his mother.
He better hear me.
Dom!
- Whoa.
- Right? It's amazing.
All these people came here
to see you, Dom.
And we used your scanning tech
to make it happen.
Check 'em out.
This is dope.
- Dom.
- Dad!
Are you okay, son?
I've never been better.
Listen to me.
Everyone in here is in danger.
Come on, Dad.
Why you gotta make everything
so serious?
This is serious.
Your boy Al G.,
- he's a bad dude.
- What?
He's using your game
to trap everyone in here.
He's not bad. He's just sad
because he works so hard
and no one pays
attention to him.
He's like me, Dad.
No, he's nothing like you.
He's manipulating you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why you using
all these charged words...
Deleted. Manipulate...
Kidnapped.
Come on, LeBron, chill out.
What'd you say, man?
I'm playing basketball.
I thought you'd be happy.
Thought you'd be happy.
Yeah, you keep it up,
you ain't gonna get
that Father's Day card.
Those things
are not guaranteed.
- Dom.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You going down,
King James.
What's good, baby?
Hey, yo, Brow,
I think it's time
for your eyebrows
to break up with each other.
Oh?
They ugly. Let it go.
What he mean?
What's wrong with 'em?
We'll show him who's boss.
What did he say, Bron?
He thinks Al G. is his friend.
I don't know what else to do.
You gotta win this game...
and get our son back.
Okay.
It's game time!
Pete's the referee?
Oh, you mad, bro?
Look,
I don't want to alarm you
or any of our viewers,
but apparently,
if the Tune Squad
doesn't win this game,
we're all gonna be
trapped here forever.
Luckily
the Tune Squad got
the four-time MVP LeBron James
on their team.
I ain't sweating it.
Oh, we doomed. We're doomed!
You gotta be kidding me.
Did you see
that kid fly?
Uh-huh.
He's like Superman,
but with a hi-top fade.
Rel, I gotta tell you,
this Goon Squad is loaded,
top to bottom.
Bugs Bunny is gonna need
a rabbit's foot
against this guy, Wet Fire.
Oh! Because he's wet,
and he's fire.
That's kinda brilliant.
- Whoop. Oh. Whoop. Ha-ha.
- What?
- Gimme that ball!
- Back off, rabbit.
Entering
the Splash Zone! Ha-ha!
And you know
what else is brilliant?
This ball movement, man.
Check it out.
Sufferin' succotash!
Leading!
Whoo!
Sixteen? What's up
with the score?
Style points, Dad.
Style points?
Style points?
We playing video game rules.
Style points, power-ups.
See, kids, playing video games
do pay off!
Come on, baby bunny.
Out of my way, you big worm.
Thank you.
Help me. Please.
What?
Come chase this down.
Hey!
Arachnneka
throws down a monster dunk.
And she dunks again.
And again and again.
Eat that, eat that,
eat that, eat that.
And again and again and again!
And again!
And again!
Ow.
Down goes the king!
Is... Is this legal?
Man, she got six arms.
What else she supposed to do?
Oh, boy.
Get up, LeBron.
We need you.
How'd that taste, King?
Yeah! Can't touch us.
Listen, Bron-Bron.
This is basketball,
but with a spin to it.
We gotta think outta the box.
There's only one basketball.
And, Bugs,
don't do nothing looney.
Nothing looney?
Let's go!
We're not called
the "Fundamental Tunes."
Don't just stand there,
rabbit!
Get the ball to LeBron!
LeBron's so hard
to guard down low
using that huge size
advantage.
Sorry, son. You know
I gotta go win this game.
If you say so.
Ooh,
he just got blocked by Dom.
The King has been dethroned.
His own son.
That is cold-blooded, Ernie.
Look, this is not like
any kind of basketball
LeBron has ever seen.
Whoo!
I've never seen
anything like this.
Where's that pass going?
- Hey, what up, Bugs?
- Watch the hair.
Thank you. Assist.
Top floor!
33-pointer?
- Oh, yes!
- Huh?
Well played.
See, this is why we practice.
We didn't. We don't practice.
What's up with that, Pete?
You can't move the basket like
that, man, that's cheating.
No, you can.
You can move the basket.
Man, you don't
even know what you're talk...
A technical?
Oh, you're gonna give me
a technical?
Man, I wish you would. Tsk!
I say, what kind of ship
are you running here?
You gotta call the game fair.
I say, fair!
Well, that happened.
Never in my career
did I think
I'd say these five words,
"Foghorn Leghorn
just got ejected."
This is not going well.
Your dad's got this. I hope.
Let's go. Stand her up.
D up! Right there.
Come here, bunny.
- Got you!
- Iverson'd! Ha-ha!
- Way to go!
- We love LeBron!
Let's go!
You act like
it's the first time
you ever dunked.
Buckets.
Buckets.
Who you calling "worm"?
Not you, girl.
Ooh! I got her, I got her!
Oh, she got me.
We're gettin' murderized!
Try a power-up, Dad!
What you got, King?
Gimme that, gimme that,
gimme that!
- Oh, I got this.
- Wait!
LeBron's on a mission.
He wants to go coast to coast!
And...
then some.
Ouch.
Ooh.
Yikes.
LeBron just hit a force field.
Man,
and speaking from experience,
that's gonna leave a mark.
We gotta stop meeting
this way.
Tell me about it.
Time out.
I'm not a betting duck,
but, uh, my money's
on the other team.
Let's run a triangle offense.
- We're getting crushed.
- A square offense.
A trapezoid offense?
Any shape!
I know.
Look at 'em.
Their spirit is broken,
and that's exactly
what we want.
But I guess it's time to
put 'em out of their misery.
Go ahead and take
a little break, Dom Dom,
because do you know
what time it is?
What time is it, Al?
Oh, it's Dame Time.
New character unlocked.
New character?
Here's our first
Goon Squad substitution
of the night.
Chronos!
It's the King Stomper!
- Granny, I'm subbing you out.
- What?
- Road Runner, you're in.
- Beep, beep.
Knock yourself out, kid.
Chronos!
Oh, yeah! Whoo!
Chronos!
Beep, beep.
Beep, beep.
Sheesh!
Dude could use a makeover.
Mmm. Oh.
Wow. Whoo!
Hmm. Oh. Okay.
Ha-ha! Word.
Oh...
Yeah!
- Dame Time!
- Bye, bye!
Ooh, I'm feeling salty now.
Way to Dominate!
That's how you do it, Dom!
Goon Squad, what?
Yeah, Dom!
Puttin' the lights out!
Yeah, Dom!
- Hey, Tune lover.
- Wow.
- You feel good?
- Feel great.
What a job. What a job!
Amazing. He's amazing.
Goon Squad, what you got?
They can't touch us.
Goon Squad!
We got this.
You're the best, Dom.
You're the best!
Come on, give it up!
Give it up!
Thanks for the turnovers.
Goon Squad!
Goon Squad!
Oh, please don't let us
get deleted.
Please don't let us
get deleted.
Come on, guys.
Don't give up.
There's a whole other half
to play.
I'm telling you,
we can still win this.
How? We're getting decimated.
We need a boost. A pick-me-up.
A secret weapon.
We need a miracle.
I don't know
if this counts as a miracle,
but I found Michael Jordan!
He was in the audience.
I know he can help.
His Airness?
You found him?
I can feel his power already.
Ooh, I can hear his shoes.
At guard, 6'6",
from North Carolina...
Number 23,
Michael Jordan...
Huh?
Come on, man.
That's Michael B. Jordan.
The actor.
I was just getting
some popcorn,
and then this cat grabbed me.
We couldn't get
Michael A. Jordan,
so we got Michael B. Jordan?
How could you think
he was His Airness?
They look nothing alike.
It's been 25 years.
I thought he aged gracefully.
This is awkward, um,
but I believe in you guys,
okay?
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose. You hear me?
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose!
- Say it with me...
- Mike.
Yeah, y'all got this.
I'm... I'm too much.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'mma go back to my seat.
You came back three-one.
- Well...
- You killed it.
You can do it again!
Right.
Well, that was a bust.
Anyone else
got any bright ideas?
Come on!
Get it together, guys.
The Tune Squad
doesn't give up at halftime.
The Tune Squad
doesn't give up ever.
We're down a thousand points.
No team is coming back
from this.
Well, why don't you try
coaching us better, bucko!
I've been coaching y'all
this whole time!
Sylvester over here
getting the wrong MJ,
Granny's out here
having a martini at halftime,
and Taz might as well
be playing for the other team!
Your son
plays for the other team.
Yeah, you're a bad dad.
I'm a bad dad?
I've been trying
to save my son
and coach y'all
at the same time.
- What y'all doing?
- We've been trying.
Trying to do what?
Trying to be like you.
And it's not working.
Because you're not me.
"You never let me just...
do me."
Huh?
Okay, I got it. New game plan.
Bugs.
Time to do
what you guys do best.
You know something?
If we're going out,
we're going out looney.
Let's go, team!
All tooney, big mooney,
full looney!
Good plan.
I say, good plan.
It seems bleak,
but let's remember,
there's an entire half
left to play.
Oh, that first half
was interminable.
Are you kidding me?
It's showtime!
Yeah! Let's go, Tunes!
Yep, we in here.
Are we ready?
Tune Squad,
we in the building!
Ha-ha. Yes, sir!
Tune Squad!
Hey, they may be down
a gazillion points,
but LeBron James and the Tunes
are coming back out here
for the third quarter
with some renewed energy.
And I don't understand why.
They are losing really badly.
All right, here we go
in the third quarter.
Uh-oh.
Yeah! Bird versus baby bird.
Do you have your ticket?
'Cause the 11:50 Express
is running on time.
Hmm? Huh?
Classic.
Give me that ball, rabbit.
Whoa!
Someone's absorbed
in the game.
Beep, beep.
- Yo.
- Hey, guys.
Where's the ball?
Beep, beep.
Beep, beep.
Oh, no! Are you kidding me?
Road Runner smokescreen?
It's the oldest trick
in the book!
Tweety!
Ooh, slam dunk!
Just like I drew it up.
Gossamer, I say,
he's the quicker-picker-upper.
Oh, what
a no-look pass ahead to Dom.
Looks like the Goons
are playing keep-away.
Dom passes to Wet Fire.
Wet Fire back to Brow.
He's gonna dunk... Oh!
But he freezes at the rim!
Oh? Huh?
What are you doing?
Giving new meaning to
"suspended from the game"!
Give me that.
But the Goons fast break,
take it to the other end.
These silly Tunes don't have
what it takes to win.
No, wait, wait.
I wasn't trying to start a...
Oh, we rappin' now?
We rappin'?
Hey, Porky, fry 'em.
Fry 'em? Me... Me... Me?
Show 'em who you really are,
Notorious P.I.G.

Style points.
I'm not exactly sure
what we just witnessed here.
He just got
bonus points for those bars.
He was spittin' hot fire.
Yeah!
Taz brings it up.
He can really pat the rock.
And it's stolen by The Brow!
Back to Tasmania,
ya little devil.
Taz!
Huh?
- Yeah!
- Let's go! Yeah!
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!
Make a call, Pete!
Oh, you wanna swallow
your whistle?
Yeah! How'd that taste?
Now call the game!
How did I lose control?
I didn't lose control.
You lost... You...
This one lost...
I haven't lost any...
Yeah, baby, let's go.
Let's go!
- Yes!
- Yay, LeBron!
- Let's go!
- Yes!
- Let's go, Tunes!
- Here we go! Let's go!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Wow!
Check out this crowd.
Everyone really getting behind
the Tune Squad.
You know somethin',
it's about time.
Coming off
the bench now for the Tunes,
Wile E. Coyote.
Beep, beep.
Wow.
Look out.
Looks like Wile E.'s
gotten himself
mixed up in the machine.
And just like that,
the Tunes have a thousand
points on the board.
We havin' fun yet?
They're gonna clean
these coyotes off the court
and keep the game going.
What's wrong, Al?
That was awesome.
What do you mean,
"What's wrong?"
They're catching up.
Run Dame Time.
Not him again.
He's gonna
make bacon out of us.
Oh, don't worry.
Time's on our side.
She knows time is literally
on their side, right?
You sure about this, Granny?
I'm going old-school
on his butt.
Whoa.
Come on.
Stop!
Tick-tock.
Hyah!
She is The One.
What in the AARP
is going on out here?
I got hops! Whoo!
Lola!
Got you, Bron!
There we go! Let's go!
And the Tunes
take the lead!
What a play from Lola
and LeBron James!
A monster jam!
LeBron came back
from three-one down.
Can he come back
from this far back?
Let me tell you this,
I woke up today
and only knew one world.
Then I got sucked into
my phone, and at this point,
anything's possible!
- Way to go, Tunes!
- Let's go!
Foghorn, right here.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- I say, that's all right!
- Lola!
Yes! My dude!
Taz!
- Go, baby! Yeah!
- Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Way to go,
Tune Squad!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!
Now we having some fun! Yeah!
Whoo-hoo! This is
fun basketball right here!
- Be yourselves! Be yourselves!
- All right!
Hey, Dom, are you a Tune
or are you a Goon?
Tune or Goon? Tune or Goon?
Make up your mind.
Make up your mind.
Let's go. Sit down.
Yeah. Way to get looney
out there.
Ooh-whee!
We did it!
Everybody happy, huh?
Everybody having
a good time? Yeah?
You having a lot of fun
out there?
'Cause that's all
that matters, right?
Is that you're having fun.
That doesn't matter at all!
What matters is that
I win this game!
Oh, and you, Dom.
How are you losing
at your own game?
For server's sake,
I didn't even think
that was possible!
I expected a lot more
out of you, son.
Get your head in the game.
I need to win!
All right!
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw!
Drinks on me!
Boy, that was awesome!
Go team!
Yeah, maybe
your dad was right about you.
Letting you be you
was a mistake.
Okay.
If everybody would move down,
then we could all sit
on the bench.
Let's all sit on the bench!
Now that's what
I call momentum, son.
- LeBron?
- Way to go!
Hey, you with us?
I'm so tickled.
Let's end this.
I'm getting my son back.
Iso. Clear out.
I wonder what move
he's gonna do.
The post-up?
Maybe the fadeaway.
He's gonna dunk all over him.
Look at that kid!
Kid's too small.
Dad, what are you doing?
We're in the middle of a game.
Hey, what's goin' on?
I don't know.
Dad...
Dom, your game
is amazing, son.
But I guess
I would've known that
if I would've listened more.
Sorry I didn't.
For me, when I was a kid,
the things that I went through
to get where I am now,
I had to be a certain way.
Yeah, it helped me win games,
but not so much being a dad.
I'm still learning how.
You're teaching me.
I want you to be yourself.
Do you understand
how much I love you?
Do you understand
how important you are to me?
How very special you are?
I mean, I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.
Sounds right to me.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, son.
- Oh, now, that's beautiful.
- Let's go!
Whoo!
I think I'm gonna cry.
Not me.
Bugs, pull it together.
Dom!
Dom!
Mom!
Hey, Xosha!
Are you serious?
Zip it!
You two are a joke,
you know that?
I got this, Dad.
Oh, what?
You got something to say?
Yeah.
I think you want people to
fear you more than anything.
And I'm not about that, Al G.
I'm playing with my dad.
First of all, it's Mr. Rhythm
to you, you little traitor.
Second of all, you're not.
You're playing
against your dad.
See what this says?
"Goon Squad."
You already
made your choice, Dom.
Right, Pete? He can't...
Pete, are you crying?
There's no crying
in the Serververse, Pete!
All right. Yeah, all right.
I see how it is, Dom.
I see how it is.
I gave you everything!
I say, I say,
good to have you, son.
Great spot for you
right here, kid.
We got 'em now!
Bienvenido, senorito!
Somebody get him a new jersey.
Welcome to the hunt.
Sufferin' succotash!
I made this, just in case.
Thanks, Granny.
Eh. What's up, Dom?
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Here you go, Dom.
Really glad
to have you on the team!
Thanks, Dad.
Fine.
You wanna join these losers?
You go ahead, Dom.
'Cause it's not your game
anymore.
I am the game.
King Kong
ain't got nothin' on me!
- Did you see that?
- Uh-huh.
The man just grew,
like, five feet.
Yo, King.
You're about to lose
your family, your friends,
those Tunes,
everything you love.
I don't think so.
Oh, it's on.
Count it!
Yeah, Lola!
All right!
Nice pass, King!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!
That's cute.
But I thought I told you...
What?
Ugh!
...it's my game now.
Yo, yo, switching everything.
Yo', stay home. Bump out.
Sic 'em, Goons.
Get back, rabbit.
Ow!
Come here!
Incoming!
Whoo!
I'm a monster!
We about to break
the internet, baby!
It's over.
Time out.
Oh, brother.
Did you see that?
He's cheating!
Well, I say, I say,
that plain ol' sucks.
Listen, it's all right.
All we gotta do
is get one bucket.
How can we score
if he controls the game, Doc?
Whoa!
Where my Goons at?
Right here, Coach!
No mercy!
That no-good,
despicable son of a glitch!
Yo! That's it!
Your move, Dad. Remember?
The step-back glitch.
In and out, crossover,
step back, shoot.
That move froze my whole game.
And that's good because...
If the game crashes,
Al G. won't be able
to control it anymore.
And if he can't control it,
he can't stop us
from scoring.
Right!
- Oh, boy!
- Yeah! Yay!
Wait.
- That's not gonna work.
- Why not?
When my character did
the step-back, it got deleted.
So, whoever does
the glitch move...
Will get deleted.
So, I say, so I guess
we're drawing straws.
We are not doing that.
We'll think of something else.
What about the old alley-oop?
I'm gonna do the step-back.
What? No.
Dad, you'll be deleted.
I'm not
a video game character.
I think I'll be okay.
Dad, you don't know that.
I've done the calculations.
Dom.
Somebody's gotta do something.
LeBron,
you don't have to do this.
No!
Listen, just get me the ball.
Hands in.
Tune Squad on three.
One, two, three...
Tune Squad!
Here we go.
Yeah, this is fun, huh?
We should just do it again,
and again, and again.
Just over, and over, and over
for all eternity.
How's that sound?
Ten seconds
on the clock.
The Tunes are one style point play away from victory,
or defeat.
This is
their last chance.
Bugs, what are you doing?
And it looks like
a broken play!
In and out, crossover,
step back...
Bugs, no!
Shoot!
Bugs' shot
is gonna be short.
But wait, LeBron is flying
through the air!
Come on, Dad.
Oh, no.
He's not gonna make it.
He's... He's not...
Gonna make it.
No.
That's cheating!
Great. Posterized.
Yeah! Yes! Let's go!
Whoo!
We did it! Yeah!
- Posterized. Yeah!
- Beep, beep.
The Tunes win!
The Tunes win!
Unbelievable!
Al G. just got turned
into a literal poster.
This is not
how I wanted to go out!
- Yeah!
- I say, I say,
- that's all right!
- That's what I'm talkin' about!
No, no, no, no, no!
Hold on. No! No!
Adios, Goons!
We won! Whoo-hoo! We won!
Give me a hug!
- Somebody hug me! Anybody?
- I love y'all. Yeah, Tunes!
- All right, Dad!
- Beep, beep.
Great assist, Dom!
Whoa!
Yes! I never doubted you
for a second, LeBron!
We are going home!
Thank you so much!
You are the Akron Hammer.
The chosen one!
King James, man! I love you!
We going home.
Bugs...
How'd I do, Coach?
Bugs, that's the least looney
thing you've ever done.
You got that right.
But taking care of the people
you love is fundamental.
Right, Doc?
Thank you.
Goodbye, Bron.
We did it.
We're all back together again.
Bugs.
That's all, folks.
- Son?
- Dad.
- You're all right, right?
- I'm good.
- You're sure?
- I'm good.
All right, let's go home.
Come here, boy.
Daddy!
- Baby, hi. Xosha, hey!
- Daddy!
- Baby!
- Mom!
- Missed y'all so much.
- Bro, that was amazing.
I'm so proud of you!
All my family.
My goodness.
- I love you, guys.
- We love you, too.
Come on, Malik.
Come on in, man.
You the Bron, man!
It's a family affair, man.
Come on in.
LeBron! LeBron.
Hey, Malik, you good?
No. No, man.
- You cryin'?
- What?
All right.
- I ain't crying, bruh.
- Okay.
So, Dom,
you ready for basketball camp?
Yeah.
I'm actually pretty excited.
Yeah? Because I know
how much you really wanted...
I think
I'mma just take a break
from video games for now.
You know, after we...
Got sucked into one?
Yeah.
Really? Because, like...
I mean, I feel like
I've made a mistake.
I mean, we can turn around
right now if you want to.
What are you talking about?
Look.
I mean, I figured it's
about time for you to do you.
Thank you, Dad.
You're welcome.
Hey, man, have fun.
Yo, Dom.
Ball?
I think I'mma hold onto it.
Aw, that's so sweet.
What's up, Doc?
- Bugs! How did you...?
- Come on.
You didn't think you'd get rid
of me that easily, did you?
I told ya, I'm a Tune, Doc!
I can survive anything!
It's good to see you, buddy.
Oh, by the way,
you think I could
crash at your pad
for a few days?
Of course. There's more
than enough room for you.
Great! I've never been
to Tinseltown.
I wanna go on a star tour.
I hear they love
drinking juice here.
Oh, do they make carrot juice?
They juice anything
for you here.
Oh, hey, can I stay
for Taco Tuesday?
Taco Tuesday!
No doubt.
Hope you and Mrs. LeBron
got bunk beds
'cause I got some friends
who wanna visit.
Hold up, hold up.
Bunk beds?
That's right. I brought
the whole gang with me!
What do you mean,
"the whole gang"?
You can't get rid
of us now, Doc.
We're family!
That's all, folks.
