Whose letter?
I'm not able to recognize
the handwriting.
M. Mitra.
Must be someone from
your mother's side.
There's no one called M. Mitra.
Whose letter is it?
Whose letter is it, Mother?
- Wait, dear.
Wow! The matter is terrific.
What is written?
Anything bad?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
- Whose letter is this?
Your younger grandpa.
- The one who had left home?
It's been ages since
he left home.
35 years, he left in 1955,
I was 2 years old then.
He left immediately after
clearing his B.A. exams.
I don't remember anything.
Whatever I've heard,
was from my mother.
We last heard of him in 1968.
Mother, elder uncle, no one
was informed about him.
Only Shetalbabu used to receive
cards, occasionally.
From the various cities
in the West.
We couldn't reply to him
as his cards never
carried his address.
Shetalbabu means, that
family friend of yours?
Yes, he was Grandpa's friend.
He has even come to our house.
Yes, the one who used
to work in A.G. Bengal!
He's retired, now and stays
in Shantiniketan? Isn't it?
He has come to know
about us from him.
From where has he
sent the letter?
Delhi. Qutub hotel.
What has he written? Read
it aloud. Let me listen.
His Bengali is still
too crisp and classy.
My dear Khuki.
- Khuki! Who's that?
Let me read it first.
I don't know your actual
name, that's why
I'm addressing you
with this name.
Oh my! It sounds like
the language of saints!
When I sacrifice my body, then,
you're actually Khuki.
Anyway, I've finished my tour around
the West and have settled here.
Through Shetalkanto uncle, I
came to know that you're the
only one surviving of my relatives.
In fact, you're happily living
with your husband and children.
In a few years, I'll be giving
up this material life of mine.
It's my wish to be your
guest for a week
in my birthplace, Kolkata.
You won't be able to recognize
this uncle of yours
and I, too, will not be
able to recognize you.
I understand that under such
circumstances, this wish
of mine will be like
an imposition to you.
In our country, the customs
that prevailed regarding guests
under that, even a stranger
wouldn't be denied access
as a guest, into a family.
Due to that custom
I gathered the courage to
put forward my request.
I've decided that on the 16th,
I'll board the Rajdhani express.
and reach Kolkata
on the 17th, morning.
With the help of a taxi, I'll
find your house and be there.
Your decision regarding
my visit as a guest
is up to you, and your
decision will be respected by me.
Remember, whether sweet or
bitter, I'll listen to whatever you say.
Blessings, your younger uncle,
Manomohan Mitra.
You were saying that you didn't
have any relatives.
Short, thin, dark, fair, don't
you remember anything!?
No!
- Then, there's only one way.
We've to send an immediate reply.
Not a letter, but a telegram.
Why should I lie?
What's a lie? Don't people
go on holidays?
He doesn't know that
I work in an office.
Suppose I was a college
professor?
Then, I must've been enjoying
my Pujo holidays, now.
But you aren't a professor.
What's the assurance that
this person isn't lying?
Do you know how many kinds of
frauds take place these days?
Babaramdev's collection,
Francis' collection.
There're goods worth Rs. 78 lakhs,
in this wardrobe.
Forget that, if one sells those
bronze elephants on that
book shelf to a foreign
tourist, one can make a fortune.
Do you want to say that
this man is coming with
a motive to steal?
Uncle was very dear to Mother.
Even Grandpa used to love
Uncle very much.
And that too, not
without a reason.
Uncle had many prized qualities.
He was never second in life.
In 35 years, a man can change
completely. Do you know that?
It doesn't appear so
from this letter.
I accept that he's your uncle,
and that he's very good.
But won't you think over what
your husband's saying?
What are you trying to say?
This gentleman is coming on Friday.
He'll stay here for 7 days.
It means that our whole
weekend would be spoilt.
It's Saptami on the 21st.
I had thought that I would
relax during Pujo.
But that's not going to happen.
This old man will be sticking to us.
Come in! Sit, brother!
I'll spread the carpet!
I'll lay the table!
I do not like it, at all.
- What? - Your attitude, what else?
That telegram isn't the right
way to reply to this letter.
This is such a good letter.
- I'm not denying it.
It's not only good,
it's overly good.
That's where the problem lies.
The one who has been out of
the state for so many years
how does he manage to write
so nicely in Bengali?
Maybe he has written the letter
with someone's help.
The language is someone else's.
But the thought is his.
No! No, there's definitely
Something wrong in this.
Ok.
Mother, want Grandpa to come?
- Ask your father.
What happened?
Are you angry?
Do you want to say that having
any stranger as an uncle
is better than not
having an uncle?
I just want to say that he has
written that he would be
arriving on the 17th.
Let him come.
What's the necessity
to send a letter?
If, on arrival, we find
that he isn't my uncle
or that he looks suspicious,
then I, myself, will send
him back with due respect.
You don't need to do anything.
Is it alright? - Bravo!
Wow! Mystery grandpa!
Clean properly under the
wardrobe. It's too dusty.
And Madhu, when your
job is done
place a glass of cold
water over here.
You stay there. And when
he comes, inform me.
Mother! He has come!
Listen, you all, come down.
You've to lift some luggage.
What's your name?
- Satya.
Satya, what? Krishna's disciple?
Or Sundindra Bose's son?
What's your name?
- Anila. Please, come in.
Did you get my letter?
- Yes, I received it.
But I didn't get your reply.
Did you write a refusal? - No.
Please sit.
- Shall I sit here? - Yes.
Don't I know that
I've troubled you?
The one whom you haven't seen,
accepting just his words
What are you saying?
It's a joy to get back
something that was lost.
Where's your husband?
- He's in the office.
He has a holiday for
the next 2 days.
And the Pujo is from the 21st.
- Ok.
Shall I give you something
to drink?
You can bathe after
resting for some time.
Ok. But don't add ice
to it, dear. - Ok.
While coming, I thought I would
buy some sweets for you.
Then I remembered that I don't
know where to get what.
In the end, if I buy
something inedible
Bhimnath, Ganguram, are
these shops still there?
Yes, there are new shops, too.
Is this Coca cola? - Yes.
- Are these available here?
Oh God! Since when did they
change the spelling of the thumb?
Very good. Do you
study in a school?
We've a month long vacation,
now. For the Pujo.
While coming here, I saw
tents in many places.
I understood that I had
come during the Pujo.
Did you see any Pujo after
leaving the state?
No, I didn't see any Pujo,
dear. But, I saw the Rath Yatra.
Do you know where? In New
York, Madison Avenue.
It's the same, over here. The
whites are crazy about it.
Rath Yatra has become their
festival. It isn't ours anymore.
Do you know the 108
names of Krsna, sir?
108 names! Do you know?
- No.
My grandmother used to sing it.
I'll teach it to you, ok?
Will you take a bath? - Only if
you don't have a problem.
Not at all. Your room
is on the 2nd floor.
He'll show it to you.
It belongs to my father-in-law.
Did your husband inherit it?
- Yes. - C'mon, Satyendra.
I didn't ask you about
your food, that's why.
Listen, I'm all-hungry,
and all eating
you don't need to
worry about that.
Has he come?
- Yes, just now. - How is he?
What can I say?
He speaks nicely.
And he addresses me as dear.
It sounds good.
He may be calling you dear
but have you started
calling him uncle?
You can't forget your
own so easily.
Does he have any resemblance
to your mother?
No. But one thing matches,
he has a good voice.
Has he already sung to you?
Just 2 lines. I'll tell
you when you return.
How is his Bengali?
- Better than us, not worse.
What are you saying? It's
increasing my suspicion.
Listen! - Now what? - Ask
him to show his passport.
There's no other better way
to trap him, than this.
Have you gone mad? How
can I do all this?
If you want to do all this, then
do it after you come back home.
I'm hanging up. I've
a lot of work to do.
We've come, dear. I'm wearing
a kurta-pyjama. Will it do?
Of course.
I didn't have any clothes
that could be worn here.
That's why I had to buy
all this in Delhi.
That's fish. Please sit.
When you're all-hungry, then
you've to eat everything.
You remembered that, but
forgot all eating?
You keep the other things
for the night.
I'll eat only fish now.
Do you know what this is?
You won't believe for
how many years
I haven't even seen
Bengali food.
This is a spinach curry.
- O spinach!
Do you know him, boy?
- Yes, Popeye
derives his strength
from spinach.
I'll show something new to you.
- Oh God! What's this?
Karnapuri, the people of Mednipur,
prepare it in their homes.
Such a variety of food, this
is possible only in Bengal!
Give me one, Mother.
Won't you eat, dear?
- You all eat, first.
That means you haven't become
a modern woman yet.
You said that you haven't eaten
Bengali food for years.
But there are so many
Bengalis in foreign countries.
Even we have relatives
in New York.
Didn't you interact with them?
Once, when I've broken the
bonds and gone out of Bengal
then why should I get
into Bengali company?
But you haven't forgotten
the language.
Pulses first, and
then some fish.
We, too, have the same habit.
The thing is that, dear,
if one doesn't want to
one will never forget
his mother tongue.
And those who want to forget,
then do so in just 3 months.
For that, you don't need to
go to foreign countries.
In Delhi, I heard young
children calling their parents
mummy and daddy. Do you
do the same thing, boy?
You've to eat it with pulses.
Shall I give you one?
Ok. A variety of food!
Why did you leave home?
I mean, I heard from mother
that you were dear to everyone.
You were a brilliant student,
you had a bright future.
Even then, why did I leave the
house, isn't it? - Yes.
There's a very beautiful phrase
in German, Vahn Deluest.
It means a desire to travel.
Was that the only reason
you left home?
I had that desire. There was
another reason as well.
Let the fish be. I'll
take some meat.
Enough.
You didn't tell the other
reason. - Are you listening to us?
I'll tell you. You'll enjoy it.
When I was small, I used
to sketch very nicely.
Yes, I had heard
that from mother.
So, I had decided that
after my college
I would join an art school.
One day it so happened, I
was in my 1st year then.
I got hold of a
foreign newspaper.
I opened it and saw
a bison's picture.
It wasn't a photo,
it was a sketch.
Do you know what a bison is?
- Yes, it has horns.
It was charging fiercely.
Do you know, dear
it was an amazing picture.
So deadly, so fierce,
it was captivating.
Who could've drawn
such a picture?
It was written in the paper
that in Spain, 30,000 years ago
in the Alta Mira region, a
caveman had drawn the picture.
It was so extraordinary
that I said to myself
I swear on your blood, Bison,
whatever I become in life
I won't ever become an artist.
There isn't any art school in
the world, that will teach
me to draw such a bison.
Since then, there was a
debate within myself
regarding what's civilized,
and what's uncivilized.
And the other reason
Vahn Deleust, these
two made me leave the country.
You had written that you will
be going abroad again.
Yes, this time I'll be
going to Australia.
I haven't seen that island yet.
This is a Greek coin, Drachma.
This is a Polish Zloty.
This is from Mexico, Peseta.
This is from Peru, Scholl.
Anish's uncle, too,
collects coins.
I know what it's called. - What
is it called? - Numismatics.
Very good.
I don't collect coins. I don't
have a desire for money.
These were left behind with
me, I give them to you.
To me? - You can show
them to your friends.
I've told my friends, not
everyone, but a few of them.
What've you told? - That
someone has come to my house
he may be my grandfather,
and may be not.
They'll be coming
to meet you, today.
Bablu! Come. Doesn't
he need to rest?
I shall leave now.
What did you say?
It's German. It means
see you later.
Think about it, the highest
peak in South America, Andes.
On it, 4000 ft. above ground
level, is this stone city.
400 years ago, people didn't
even know about that city.
After that, in 1911, when
Mohun Bagan defeated
the whites and won the
IFA shield, that year
Heram Bengam, a traveler,
suddenly discovered this city.
What's the name of the city?
- Machupichu.
Look at this!
- Wow!
Have you been to this city?
- Of course.
This photo has been taken by me.
I had been there 20 years ago.
On the back of a donkey.
I was shocked on
seeing the city.
Everything over there
was made of stone.
But, there isn't
any stone nearby.
From where did the stone come?
How did they take it
up that mountain?
No one knows about it.
The Inca civilization
was highly advanced.
Another story!
- No more stories.
Now, I'll show you magic.
What's all this?
I'll ask you a few things,
let's see whether
you can answer them correctly.
Ready. - Ready!
Tell me, which one's larger,
the sun or the moon?
The sun!
- How did you know? Wait.
This is the sun, and
this is the moon.
They both appear to be
the same in the sky.
The sun is much farther away.
How farther? I'll tell you.
The sun is 9.5 crore miles away.
And the moon is just
5 lakh miles away.
That's why they appear
to be the same in size.
Suppose, instead of 5 lakhs,
had the moon been just
2 lakh miles away, then
how would it have appeared?
The sun would've
appeared larger.
Like this, isn't it?
- Yes.
And suppose it would've been
8 lakh miles away, then?
Then it would've appeared
much smaller.
Like this, isn't it?
- Yes.
But that didn't happen. The
moon is just far enough
so that it's like this.
That's why when the moon
overshadows the sun
covers it completely
- Solar eclipse.
Total solar eclipse. And when
the earth's shadow covers
the moon, from all sides
- Lunar eclipse.
Total lunar eclipse.
How does it happen?
You don't know? Ask the
wisest man on earth
even he won't be able
to say. No one knows.
This is a mystery. According
to me, it's
the biggest mystery
of the universe.
The sun and the moon, one's
the king of the day
and the other, the
queen of the night.
The earth's shadow on the moon.
Everything's dark
on one side. Magic!
Listen!
- What's the matter? - Listen!
I'm convinced.
- That's he's your uncle?
And also a very good man.
I'm able to see that you're
easily convinced.
In a few hours, you've
recognized a man's true nature?
Women can. Women aren't
as suspicious as men.
Moreover, can't you understand
from one's behavior
and thoughts?
There's no doubt that he has
traveled around countries.
He knows German.
Moreover, he has also given
a few coins to Bablu.
Foreign coins?
Do you know that one can
purchase foreign stamps?
Similarly, there are dealers
for foreign coins, too.
Which countries' coins
do you want?
I'll get them for you,
tomorrow itself.
Did he tell you
why he left home?
That's when he mentioned
this German phrase.
This means a desire to travel.
Yes, but he didn't pronounce
it like you.
Isn't it?
- Yes.
This phrase is also
used in English.
And when used, it's done so
with an English accent.
I had learnt German for
months in Max-Muller Bhavan.
Due to lack of patience,
I couldn't go ahead.
Even now, I remember half
of what I learnt.
And what other reason did
he give? - For what?
For leaving home, what else?
It's a long story, it
will take a long time.
Even then, let me listen to it.
Bison! Are you able to
understand anything? - Bison!
There's a guest in the house,
you're the head of the family.
The host. At least,
meet him once.
Where's the gentleman?
- He must be in his room.
He had gone to the playground
with Bablu and his friends.
He returned sometime
ago. Get up!
If there isn't a sieve in
the house, then get one.
Please keep my word, at
least take his blessings.
Come in!
Good evening. - Good evening.
No! Never! When your heart
is clear of all doubts.
If it does, only then will
the question of taking my
blessings, arise.
Not otherwise.
I had written in the letter,
and I'm telling it now.
I know that it's an
awkward position.
I know who you are. But
you don't know who I am.
Unfortunately, whether
I'm genuine or a con.
The real uncle or a fake uncle,
there isn't any easy way to
find out.
To find all this, you've
to give some time.
Are you ready to give that
much time? Think about it.
But I'm not able to understand
why you're saying that there
isn't any easy way.
This is it!
Thanks!
It's your name, Manomohan Mitra.
This is your picture.
Distinguishing mark
mole on the right cheek.
Then it's alright.
What did this prove,
Sudhendra Bose?
You'll say identity. I'll
say, not even that.
In this age of globalization
there're plenty of ways
to fake passports.
This passport proves nothing.
Yes, you've the right
not to believe me.
But, this can't be
told to your wife.
She's quietly doing her duties,
without any flaw.
There's the pull of the blood
relation, but that's with your
wife, not with you.
So you have the
right to kick me out.
Look, I haven't unpacked
my suitcase yet.
If you so desire, then I can get out
of this house in just 5 minutes.
Why are you saying so? My
wife likes you very much.
There is no question of my, my...
- I am at your mercy.
You forget this. I just have
one question. - What?
Why did you suddenly feel
the urge to come back
to your motherland?
Think of it, whether you'll
believe it or not.
I didn't feel like returning
to my country.
After roaming the West, I had
decided to travel around the East.
For that, I had
to come to Delhi.
All these days
I didn't feel the pull of
the blood, towards anyone.
This time, maybe due to my age...
You rest. I'll come
back after my bath.
You win. He's genuine.
Passport.
- It's alright.
Did he show it?
- Yes, almost.
Then why are you saying almost?
He's the actual uncle.
He can fool 50 people
of my kind.
Do you know what he says?
- What?
Says this passport
proves nothing.
That passports can be easily
faked, these days.
You wanted to see the passport.
Are you happy?
Your so-called uncle
is a man of many arts.
How would I have known that?
Whatever you say
I'm sure that he's playing
some sort of a game.
I'm not able to get it.
It seems that the final
decision will be taken
tomorrow evening.
Meaning?
Tomorrow, I've asked
Pritish to come over.
You need a cunning man for this.
And you know it very well
that he isn't your husband.
If I have some chronic problem,
then it's nothing but shyness.
Pritish isn't so. I've
told him about it.
And he's most intrigued.
He claims that he has handled
many such cases earlier.
Will he try to trap him? That
barrister friend of your talks
very provocatively.
- What do you mean by a trap?
That man claims that
he's your uncle.
He's eating our food.
By feeding him, we'll
spend at least Rs. 50-60.
In fact, we know almost
nothing about that man.
We've to do some investigation.
Pritish will do that. And he'll
do it as decently as possible.
That man saw me as
a 2 year old baby.
35 years later, when he
has come to meet me
I don't find anything
unnatural in that.
Ok.
If that man has come for
sentimental reasons
then I can understand.
But, if I find that in spite
of being your uncle
he has come here with
some other motive
then I'll have to
show him the door.
I will forget all my shyness
at that moment.
And what if he isn't my uncle?
- Then what? you're there.
To send him off ceremoniously.
Hello.
I'm Chanda speaking. Aren't
you able to recognize me?
Your voice sounds different.
- That's due to excitement.
Has he come?
- Yes, he has.
Really? - Of course. - Tell
me, what've you understood?
What'll I understand in a day?
We've, I mean, me and my
husband, are dying of excitement.
The whole day, we've been
dying to hear from you.
But, you haven't told
anybody, have you?
Believe me, we're dying
to tell everyone.
But you didn't even call us. -
You've come to know of it now.
Shall I hang up?
- No! He wants to talk to you.
I'm giving the phone to him.
Hello.
- Yes, tell me.
I've a request that you've
to accept. - What request?
In half an hour, we'll
make a visit.
But, what if he comes to know?
Listen! I guarantee that
he won't understand.
We'll come over there casually.
Talk to you all casually.
And then casually leave
after half an hour.
You tell Sudhen not to
introduce me as an actor.
Let my profession be a secret.
But, do you want to
come today itself?
I've to work in the next 2
days, as it's Saturday and Sunday.
Then you come over
- Thanks.
Then that is decided.
Are you listening?
- What happened?
Chanda and Ranjan are coming.
They want to meet him.
Very good, then inform them as
well, Mallika, Shefali, etc. etc.
Then, we won't be burdened
by the job
of entertaining that oldie.
Listen! Please introduce
him as my uncle.
Ok.
Can I come in?
Did I spoil your evening?
Not at all. Let me introduce
them to you.
They're Mr. and Mrs. Rakkhit,
and this is Mr. Manomohan Mitra.
I couldn't.
- He's Neeli's uncle.
Uncle? Uncle.
I had made a mistake. I had
another friend whose wife...
what's her name? Isn't
her name Manju?
From when did Manju
find an uncle?
Manju doesn't have an uncle.
Do you have 3 uncles, or 2?
- 2.
The elder uncle has died.
And the younger one left
home 35 years ago.
I got confused.
You were never clear.
The whole thing is very simple.
Neeli's uncle left home
35 years ago.
He came back this morning.
- From where?
From the West.
This is something sensational.
This is almost
like the Baul hermits.
Do you know the Baul hermits?
Yes, I do.
- It's a world famous case.
Do you know for how long the
case went on? 10 years.
There isn't anything
fishy over here.
I mean, that he's her uncle.
There's no doubt about that.
Good. You don't know
how lucky you are.
These days, if you get trapped
by a lawyer, then they'll
leave you only after
bankrupting you.
You would've had to go back
with a begging bowl.
Isn't this that marvelous
biscuit prepared by you?
Marvelous!?
- Excellent!
Won't you inform the press
about his return?
No, I won't, and if I find that
the press has even got
a small hint about his return,
then I'll assume that you're behind it.
I don't go around
revealing secrets.
I was imagining a headline,
the return of the prodigal uncle.
The word prodigal
has 2 meanings.
Do you know?
- 2 meanings!?
One is wasteful, and the
other is repentant.
And I'm neither of them.
I'm glad to hear that.
Can I ask something?
- Of course.
We came to know about this,
after coming here.
You've returned after so many
years. Did you return alone?
I don't have anyone else.
You haven't married?
One of the offspring of
marriage is a house.
When I left my house,
then how does
the question of
a family arise?
Yes, I understand. You're right.
Thank you.
You've returned to Kolkata after ages.
Did you leave from Kolkata?
- Yes.
How do you find the city
after so many years?
I'm a contradictory person.
I'm used to listening
to criticisms about the city.
Why criticize? No doubt
it's a civilized city.
What are you saying?
Isn't this civilized? So
many people, vehicles?
High rises all over the
place, like pillars.
And you come back here
after 35 years
and find that people are
still pulling rickshaws.
If this isn't contradictory,
then is it civilized?
It seems you have bitter
thoughts about civilization.
What do you say about New York?
- That's something I have not seen.
I've only photographs of it.
In the main part of the city,
family after family is sitting
with a placard, we are homeless.
Get it.
Are you coming from New York?
- South America, Brazil.
Brazil! What are you saying?
What's the matter?
He must be thinking of Pele.
- Pele!?
Footballer? Isn't it?
He's a great player,
don't you know?
Mr. Rakhit, My knowledge about
football is very poor.
Mohun Bagan, and East Bengal.
Remember one thing, football
is the life of a Bengali.
Football and one more thing,
which you must
surely be missing
in foreign countries.
What's that? - You can call
it a Bengali's monopoly.
You can call it a Bengali's
invention.
Rosogolla [sweet]?
- Adda [chat].
Non stop Adda. Adda in
a club. Adda in a park.
Adda on the banks of a lake.
Adda in a coffee shop.
Without which a Bengali won't
even be able to digest his food.
Adda is made in Bengal.
Allow me to contradict
you, Mr. Rakkit.
2500 years ago, in Greece,
there was a gymnasium.
Do you know that? - Where
they used to build bodies.
Not only that, do you know
about the essence of life?
We had learnt it
while in school.
Mel sana el corporesano.
Sound mind in a sound body.
- Right.
There, they used to exercise their
mind as well as their bodies.
There was a time when
they used to do both
within the gymnasium.
In that gym, the geniuses
of that age, Socrates, Plato
used to gather to discuss.
And the topics of
discussion were
politics, science, math,
art, and literature.
The dialogues are still there,
you can read them even now.
What will you call this?
- This is a kind of Adda.
But at the highest level.
No criticism, no
backbiting, no spitefulness.
Of course, I'm not criticizing
Bengali Adda.
Even here, there are
productive Addas.
But, what happens on a large
scale, I mean, what used to
happen during our times, of course.
Now it's all about criticizing.
It's nothing but throttling
one's conscience.
Had Bengali Adda been so good,
Rabindranath would've joined.
You're right. Rabindranath has
never participated in Addas.
Or maybe he has. Sudhen, has
Rabindranth participated in Addas?
I haven't given you his real introduction.
He's Ranjan Rakkhit, a popular actor.
He works in theatres, movies,
television everything.
Is that so?
- Yes.
He's a comedian.
- A comedian?
What do you say?
Am I good or bad?
Do you find anything laughable
over here?
I couldn't find anything
other than sad news.
It isn't a joke, but
a kind of a satire.
It's there as long as there's
politics in our country.
But it isn't exactly a
satire of that Aris...
Aristotle?
- No, not him.
...tophanes.
- What? - Aristophanes.
It's a kind of a skit
over here. - Skit.
Yes. Let me give you an example.
Assume that there's a gentleman.
A Bengali gentleman.
- You can exclude 'I'.
It's the same with me.
- Yes.
Like me, I'm from Kharagpur.
And she's from Netrakona.
You? - Jessore. - And Sudhen,
you? - Bardhoman.
Useless place. So...
- Stand up and narrate. - Ok.
A gentleman has gone to
the writers building
to meet the chief minister.
According to this gentleman
in some matters, only
75% English was enough.
He went there, the police
was standing outside.
They asked him, whom
do you want to meet?
This man said that he
wanted to see the CM.
The police man reacted,
CCM!? You mean CPM?
No, how can I see the
PM. He's in Delhi.
I have come to see CM.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes, of course, right now.
4CM, I mean 4PM.
Sorry, the CM's left.
- Why sorry? I'm also left.
What's there to feel
sorry for that?
Brother, the CM has left for home.
By then, he reacts, right.
Very good, very good.
Mr. Rakkhit, can I
ask you something?
Of course.
- How do you find me?
You had come to meet
me, isn't it?
What's the need for a newspaper?
The telephone's there.
It's too difficult to keep it
a secret, isn't it, dear?
The suspense, thrill,
of a drama.
To be or not to be, uncle.
I hope you didn't mind,
Mr. Rakkhit. - No.
In fact, I was feeling
a little like that to act.
Feeling a little like this.
What happened?
I'm not able to forget it.
- What? - Ranjan's face.
I've never seen him
so embarrassed.
I must say that I'm beginning
to like your uncle.
He's knowledgeable. It shows
that he was a bright student.
What I like most is
that man's attitude.
He knows to laugh, as well
as make others laugh.
Moreover, when
we come to think of it
We don't know anything about
this gentleman yet.
Where he was in the past
35 years? What did he do?
Why did he do it? Nothing.
A big question mark.
Surprising!
Listen, your uncle may be
an early riser.
But don't wake me up
before 9, tomorrow.
What are you thinking?
Mrs. Bose!
Will you tell me what's
the matter?
You shouldn't hide anything
from your husband at midnight.
Do you know? This is
not only science
but Sudhendra Bose's
philosophy.
Tell me what's the matter?
Tell me.
Why didn't it strike me? Why?
- What?
What's the matter?
- A man, who left home,
when you don't come to know
anything about him
then, after how many years is
it assumed that he has died?
7 years.
- Uncle left home in 1955.
Till 1968, he sent cards
to Shetalbabu.
Carry on.
Grandpa died in 1970. He left
a will before his death.
Mother gets money, elder
uncle gets money.
Grandpa used to love younger
uncle very much.
O God! He's a diamond.
Your grandpa must've surely
left something for his dear son.
Is that what you want to say?
Even if it's there, how will
he come to know of it?
We can think of that later.
First, we've to find out whether
your uncle had a share or not.
How will you find that out?
Is there no way? - I don't know.
I'm not able to think of anything.
Listen, your grandpa's lawyer
friend, the one who had
come to our marriage.
He doesn't hear properly,
moreover, he has an organization.
Don't you remember about
the good time we had?
Tridib Mukherjee. He was
70 year old at that time.
What's the guarantee
that he's alive, now?
He may be alive. And if he's
alive, he will surely know.
Why did I think of this? Why?
Are you repenting? -Yes.
I'm repenting.
I've no doubt that
he's my uncle.
And that he has come to meet me.
There can't be any
other reason than this.
You're calling him your uncle,
have you ever addressed him
so? I didn't even hear you once.
Do you know why I
haven't done so?
It's because of you, you've
sowed so much suspicion
within me that I desire, so
much, to address him as uncle.
I even try. It comes
up to my lips, yet...
Doesn't it come out?
Listen, dear. Harden yourself.
He could be a genuine one
or a fake one, too. Prepare
yourself for both results.
You're saying that it's
the pull of the blood.
I say that it's his
magnetic personality.
These days, is it easy
to get such big houses?
I feel that he has an eye
on my house, and that
he has come to claim his share.
I wanted to know, about whom
all the heirs to Mohinimohan's
legacy, were?
Washington? Who had been there?
- Heirs!
Who were Mohinimohan's heirs?
Mohini's heirs were
his three children.
Had he provided for
the three of them?
Yes, Sitemohan, Leela
both of them got it.
They got a good share.
Mohinimohan was the only ENT
specialist at that time.
Even I met him in
his own chamber.
That time, I had been
to Delhi in a flight.
I hadn't won at that time.
During the landing, my ears
were so blocked. Oh God!
They won't open at any cost. I
came back to Kolkata and
went to meet Mohini, he was
at his peak at that time.
He inserted a tube into my
nose, blew in to my ears.
His youngest son,
Mohinimohan's.
Monu? Yes, Manomohan.
Did he have any share?
- Yes, he did.
But he wasn't in the
country at that time.
I don't know which country,
But, yes, he used to inform
us that he was alive.
Do you know that
he has returned?
No, I don't.
- Will he get a share, now?
What?
Will he get money, now?
- Of course. Why not?
Money isn't a piece of
camphor to evaporate.
He'll get it if he claims it.
But, yes, he has to
prove his identity.
Will a passport do?
- Yes.
Who holds the money now?
The one who was the executioner
of Mohini's will
must be possessing it. It's
in his account in the bank.
Is the executioner a
friend of Mohinimohan?
Yes, he could or couldn't
be from Bengal.
When Mohini died, I was in
Singapore, at my daughter's place.
What's this?
- Tribal music.
Where did you get it?
I've understood.
- What? - Who you actually are.
Who? - Grandpa. - The genuine
one or the fake one?
The genuine one. - How did
you know? No one else does.
Shall I call you Grandpa,
from now on?
It would be better
if you address me
as Fleeing Grandpa.
Chotdadu? - Yes, as I'm
always ready to flee.
This life itself is all about
fleeing from one place to another.
After resting here for a few
days, I'll flee, again.
I'll be here as long
as I like it here.
Will you go away after that?
Listen, I'll tell you something
interesting. Kupomanduk.
Kupo means a well, and Manduk
refers to a frog.
A frog in a well? - Yes, think
about it, what a nasty thing.
No light, nor air, foul
smell, dirt and slush!
He stays there all his life.
There's a Kupomanduk in every
man, it's known as Kuno.
I'm not like that, that's
why I keep traveling.
What if I travel, too?
- Of course you have to.
Or else, how will you eat
the meat of an armadillo?
Whose meat!? - Armadillo!
It's an ant eating animal.
Who eats its meat?
- If I tell everything, then
my bag would be
emptied of stories.
Be patient, only then will
you bear the fruits.
I'm dead tired. A useless
hearing aid that has no use.
According to that man,
your uncle has a share.
But he said that he was in
Singapore during your uncle's death.
Which means, if your uncle
had changed the will
in case he felt that
his son won't return
then, Mr. Trideep won't
know about it.
Maybe that's what has happened.
It didn't strike me, earlier.
Had Uncle had a share, if
not anyone else, then
Shetalbabu must've
surely known.
And he would've told Uncle.
And Uncle wouldn't
have hidden such a good
news from us. Never!
Why?
Because the one who doesn't
have open hands
I won't be surprised to
know that he doesn't
have an open heart, as well.
What do you mean by that?
- The one who can
come to meet his niece after
35 years, empty-handed.
That person can be anything
but large-hearted.
Ok, you're going to
test him, today.
Then itself, we'll come to know
what kind of a person he is.
What's the matter?
Whatever he maybe,
he isn't a thief.
Was this here yesterday?
No, it was kept in another room.
Made of bronze.
These miniatures and ivory.
Are these your collections,
Sudhen? - No, my father's.
I had seen that instrument,
yesterday, too.
Is it a Sitar or a Tanpura?
- Tanpura.
Do you sing?
- Not much, just a hobby.
Not only does she sing,
but also dances.
Asking her to dance
would be too much.
But, a song won't do any harm.
Will you sing, dear? I haven't
heard a Bengali song
since I left the country.
You all drink your tea first.
I'll sing after that.
Where's Bablu?
- He is in his friend's place.
They're celebrating the Pujo.
So he spends the evening there.
And yes, you can smoke
if you want to.
I don't believe in this
seniority thing.
If you don't think of
me as a senior person
then it won't be
offending to me.
Have you come here to
celebrate the Pujo?
I didn't even know that
the Pujo has arrived.
Do you know how many times
Durga killed Mahishasura?
How many times? As far
as I know, just once.
3 times. Do you know why
Ganesha was beheaded?
I knew it when I was young.
Now, I've forgotten.
When I was young, I heard so
many mythological stories
from my grandma that I
haven't forgotten them yet.
What do you think of the
situation in the country?
Are you reading the newspaper?
Caste and religion, both
are really dangerous.
The paper is bearing
testimony to that.
Don't you believe in religion?
The Hindu scriptures have
various meanings for religion.
I'm meaning religion. - I'll
reply to your question later.
Have you all finished
drinking tea?
Are you ready, dear?
- Yes.
Who is playing the Veena?
In a sweet tune.
Who is playing the Veena?
It brings about
a new life in me.
Who is playing the Veena?
In a sweet tune.
Who is playing the Veena?
All the dreams have
come true in the dawn.
Breaking all the barriers
of time and age.
Who is playing the Veena?
In a sweet tune.
Who is playing the Veena?
It has awoken everyone
from the sleep and brought
nature to its full bloom.
It has awoken everyone
from the sleep and brought
nature to its full bloom.
I remember all that I forgot.
It's made sweet
memories come back.
Who is playing the Veena?
All those pains that the heart
gets out of miseries.
How do I face them all?
I know not.
All those pains that the heart
gets out of miseries.
How do I face them all?
I know not.
My emotions in this
world come alive.
My life also shivers thinking
of those miseries.
Who is playing the Veena?
In a sweet tune.
Who is playing the Veena?
Beautiful! It made me
think of my sister!
What was your question?
- Do you believe in religion?
Mr. Sengupta, I'm an unorthodox
kind of a person.
That's good. - Something that
creates a divide between
human beings, I don't
believe in that.
Religion does just that.
And an organized religion
surely does that.
That's the reason why I don't
believe in castes, too.
And God?
For the blind man light is God.
For the dead God is life.
Who'll give light,
who'll give life?
The problem is, Mr. Sengupta,
in these days
it has become difficult to
believe in the Holy Lord.
Daily newspapers, daily,
they attack that belief.
What do I do, tell me?
I'm with you in this opinion.
But what about science?
Voyager has sent
pictures from Neptune.
What will you like
to say about that?
What difference will
my opinion make?
Tell me what you feel.
- Nothing much.
The same that 4-5 educated
people feel.
And what is that?
Unimaginable progress
of technology.
It's something that
couldn't even be
dreamt about, a few days back.
A big feather in the cap of NASA.
NASA, there's also Nesha
[addiction] along with it.
Injecting themselves with
hypodermic syringes
and infusing addictive
juices into their body
they're releasing
summon after summon
to millions of people
around the world.
The youth of this world, which
technology can stop it, Sengupta?
You've spent so many
days in the West.
Yes, I have. - Why?
The West is the hub
of technology.
If that hurts you so much, then
you could've gone and
stayed with the tribals
in the jungles.
Look! This isn't a
part of science!
You mean to say that you've
lived with these tribals?
After leaving home, I spend the
first 5 years with these tribals.
Nothing but the truth
so help me god.
After living with the Santhals,
I went on to stay with
the Kohl, Bhil, Naga,
Munda, Orau, Tora...
How many more names
should I give you?
Have you spent time
with these tribals?
Have you ever eaten a field rat?
A snake, a monkey? Dear,
I had told you that I'm
all-hungry, it's not a figure
of speech, it's the truth.
In these 5 years, it doesn't
seem that you had
earned your living.
On the contrary all my
savings were eaten up.
You must be thinking that
where did I get my money.
Your father surely, mustn't have
sponsored your
running away from home.
My grandma, Giribaladashi.
She used to love me a lot.
It won't be wrong if I say
that she used to spoil me.
I came 1st in the matriculation,
then in the 12th grade, and
when I came first
in my B.A. exams
that old lady, gave me a
lump sum amount and said
dear, you've glorified your
generation. May God bless you!
It wasn't a small sum
during those times.
So, I leave home with my own
earnings, and I didn't
have to resort to
any evil means.
I got it. You said that
your money was spent.
So, an obvious question
that arises is that
Who paid for your trip abroad?
I was a cabin boy in the
S.S. Olympia ship.
Then? After reaching London?
- For 5 years.
Not only in London, but in
various cities of Europe.
What? What did you do there?
Struggle for existence!
Struggle, the most favorite
word for a Bengali.
I don't call it a struggle.
I call it a nutrition
for the brain.
Nutrition for the
muscles and bones.
And the first step towards
recognizing a man.
When did you return
to the jungle?
All these incidents seem
have occurred in a city.
A civilized city.
The fortune favours the brave.
The daring gets what he wants.
So fight along.
My life story will not get
you closer to the truth.
you're trying to see the
inside of an onion by
peeling of the skin on the
outside. It won't be so easy.
Even then for the sake of
record, let me tell you
I had started writing
in various journals.
Earned a lot of bank balance.
And also did some studying:
a degree in Anthropology.
Then the journey to United Nations.
United Nations? - Yes, UNO.
The reason?
Indians. - Indians?
Oh I see.
The American Indians
Were you a cabin boy there, too?
No, sir. Please don't mind,
even though, if I'm narrating
it's like a biography,
that this time, too
I came first in my exams.
I didn't have to struggle. An
anthropological society
sponsored my trip. The
condition was that
I should send them a regular
report of my trip.
I've been fulfilling
those conditions.
Throughout North and South
America, I've been to
43 Indian settlements
and spent time with them.
This is the prime reason
for my wisdom. - Ok.
Let me take over from here.
You please sit, your throat
must've gone dry.
As you wish, sir.
- I'll talk, you listen.
If there's a mistake, then
you can correct it.
The main topic, that's still
standing is that
these experiences have taught
you that civilized life
as in a city,
is illusionary.
Tribal civilization
is the real one.
It should be told at this point
that, I, in spite of being
an urban man, am not ignorant
about tribal life.
I, too, have some
knowledge about it.
I know that they have their
language, culture, religion,
arts, music, etc but...
Just a moment, Mr. Sengupta!
What's etc? This etc won't
help them understand.
How will it help them know me?
Then you tell me,
what that etc is?
Oh God!
The real thing has been left
behind, science, technology.
You're only thinking of
Neptune, only about Voyageur.
Think about this, man,
uncivilized, in an ape form
hunting, fishing, weaving,
pottery, everything necessary
for leading a civilized life,
how did he learn it?
There's a reason behind
that, architecture.
Even building a hut
requires knowledge.
Have you seen an igloo?
The house of an Eskimo?
Do you know, it requires 2
kinds of ice to build an igloo?
An opaque one, which is used to
build the walls and the ceiling.
And another, a transparent
one, for the windows.
What will you call this?
Isn't this science?
Isn't this technology?
Enough, sir!
All the mystic practices
of the tribals' like
voodoo and mumbo jumbo.
You, when you feel sick, do
you send for a witchdoctor?
I've done so, Sengupta. On many
occasions, I've done so.
Where will I find a doctor
in that jungle?
Do you know what kind of
a witchdoctor he was?
He knew everything about
500 medicinal plants.
He had cured me.
It's true that I don't send
for them, very often.
The reason being the one for
which I'm sitting on this
sofa and drinking
tea with you all.
Why are you unnecessary
complicating a simple matter?
Why aren't you able
to understand
that I, myself,
am not a tribal.
It's something I lament about.
That I'm not a tribal, that
I can't draw bison like the
cavemen of Alta Mira.
But what can be done, tell me?
Long before I left home, they
had become a part of me
Shakespeare, Rabindranath,
Bankim, Karl Marx.
That's why I need to
make field notes.
Else, had I been a tribal,
would I have needed that?
You said that you've studied
the Muriya tribal.
Yes, I have. - Then, the open
sexual encounters among
their youth, what do you
have to say about that?
Isn't it the height
of promiscuity?
Will you call that civilized?
No.
The soul that you behold in you.
Will be mine from now onwards.
The holy wedlock.
That is civilization.
Sometime back, you said
that you were all-hungry.
So, have you eaten human flesh?
I haven't been fortunate
enough for that.
Fortunate? - I've heard that
human flesh is delicious.
But I haven't eaten it. I've lied
by calling myself all-hungry.
Don't feel offended.
Then what kind of
a civilization
would you call
this cannibalism?
Civilized!? It isn't civilized!
It's barbaric!
Do you know what a
civilization is?
It's when a man pressed
a single button
to release a single atom
bomb, and destroy a whole
city of tribal in
a single moment.
And do you know who
uncivilized men are?
Those who take oaths regarding
the use of weapons.
What, Mr. Sengupta, you tripped
after taking over, isn't it?
That's bound to happen. How'll
you call me your friend?
Whether a friend or an enemy,
we haven't decided on that, yet.
Do one thing, I have a
pseudonym, it was dear to
me in my childhood, Nemo.
You can use that name.
You mean Jules Verne?
Captain Nemo?
Latin word.
Nemo means no one.
Whether you're a no one, or
someone, that's the question.
Do you know, how your visit has
ruined the peace of mind
of my friend and his wife?
You've spoilt their sleep,
do you know that?
They're very decent
that's why they haven't
shown their displeasure.
But you, aren't letting
us know whether you're
welcome or unwelcome
as a guest.
You're saying that your
passport proves nothing.
You're the one who knows
what you want.
Then why aren't you
telling that to us?
Look, either come clean
or just clear out.
Ok. I'm leaving.
Listen! Why did you have to
say that last thing you said?
This person isn't fit to live
in a civilized society.
He can't have a place
in your house.
Whatever he is, that
doesn't bother us.
He would've left
in a day or two.
And you had promised that you
would handle the matter carefully.
I know your wife, and I know
what she's feeding him.
Surely not field rat.
Hadn't he been threatened, he
would've stuck to this place.
Eating you out of
this house and more.
You don't know such
creatures, I do.
I don't know how to...
I felt like disappearing
into the earth.
He didn't even speak
at the dinner table.
I'm really sorry Nili.
Had I known that Pritish
will do such a thing.
I wouldn't have invited him.
He had written about
traditional hospitality.
Is that what we've given him?
Now, what we should do
is to remove the pain
that he's suffered
due to this insult?
Will you tell me something?
- What?
Were you able to imagine that
he spent half of his life in
this manner?
Absolutely not.
Extraordinary life.
Extraordinary experience.
He has learnt many new
things, but for that, the man
kind of went far away.
For an uncle, you feel
love, closeness.
But for him, you feel respect.
Do you know what the
difficulty is?
As a scholar, that man must've
opened his mind.
But he still hasn't
opened up his heart.
You can't try and become
a tribal, else Uncle
would, himself, have
come close to you.
That's not possible, anymore.
But, for the remaining days
we've to break his silence. His
first introduction is that
he's our guest, it's
a sin to hurt him.
You can call him as Uncle, I
don't have any objections.
If that comes from within my
heart, I'll surely do so.
But I can't force myself
to become a hypocrite.
What's this!?
Are you listening?
- What?
He's not there. The room's empty.
Meaning? - That's he's left.
There's none of his luggage.
Only this key.
I was afraid of this. What'll
you do now? - Wait.
Let me get fresh, first.
- Will you inform the police?
Give me the directory.
- Whom will you call up?
The one whom I feel like.
Give me the book.
Who is it?
- The back door is open, sir.
When did you notice it?
- An hour ago.
The bedroom door was closed
so I couldn't inform you.
Ok. You may go.
Grandpa's room is empty, Mother.
I know it, dear. - Where's
Grandpa? - I don't know.
What's that?
- Bholpur. STD.
Do you know Shetalbabu's number?
Yes. - You call him up.
- What shall I say?
First, ask him whether he's the
executor of your grandpa's will.
If he is, then ask him whether
your uncle has a share.
And whether the money
is with him.
If yes, then the last question.
Has he informed your
uncle about it?
If that too is yes, then tell
him that we'll be at
his place by 2 pm
in the afternoon.
We'll have our food on
the way, he doesn't
need to arrange for
our food. Now call him.
We'll have our food on
the way, he doesn't
need to arrange for
our food. Now call him.
Come, dear.
Are you fine?
Hasn't he come? - Yes, he has.
The train arrived an hour ago.
Then where is he?
- Come, I'll tell you.
You said over the phone
that he's a little angry.
I feel that he's more
than a little angry.
I saw him last in 1955. Sit.
I took him to visit a
zoo when he was young.
Where is he now?
That person hasn't eaten
anything since morning.
At least have lunch.
No, I won't.
At least drink a cup of tea.
No, I don't want it.
Then what was the need to come?
You've met me after so many
days, just for transacting money?
Or don't you need even that?
Then he said, there's
a need for that.
I'm here for a few days, and
then I'll return to Kolkata and
board a flight.
Then there's no need to hurry.
Moreover, today is Sunday
the bank will be closed,
nothing can be done.
Then, he's...
Have you come to Shantiniketan,
earlier?
I've come, thrice
before marriage.
There's a Santhal
village nearby, Bonerpukur.
He has gone there. He says
that he stayed there for
sometime before leaving
the country.
I don't know what the special
attraction is, over there, dear.
He should sit and talk
to me, not even that.
And do you know what's
most ridiculous, dear?
Before taking my blessings,
he took out his passport,
think about it, he took out his
passport and showed it to me
saying that he is
Manomohan Mitra.
Since we've come, let's go and
see whether we can find him.
Yes, go. And if you find him,
then bring him here, somehow.
Yes, we'll do that. - Does
he have any mental problem?
No! - I mean, I've kept so
much money for the past
20 years. 5 lakhs, think of
how much it has become, now.
No, don't worry. His
mind is crystal clear.
Let's go.
There's Grandpa!
Come. Sit.
Why did you do this?
You didn't even inform us.
My mind was in turmoil.
I'm ashamed about last
night's incident.
The thing is that, I've stayed
with different kinds of people
around the world, and when
I see that someone's
fooling around, I can't
control myself.
You haven't even eaten
anything since morning.
We've come to take you. Come.
Not now, there's no harm
in fasting for a day.
There's a dance here, today.
I've arranged for it.
I'll see that dance and then go.
You'll also see it.
The oldest tribal
civilization in India is
the Kohl civilization.
Santhals are their offspring.
150 years ago they revolted
against the British.
Will you return to Kolkata
from here? To our house?
When you've come,
I'll surely return.
But not today, tomorrow
evening by train.
I've a job here tomorrow.
You've an inheritance, don't you?
- Yes. I do.
You didn't share such
good news with us?
There was a reason for that.
I felt that since I didn't do
my duty towards my father
I don't have any rights
on his property.
Then I realized, that since
my father has left so much
money, lovingly, for me...
Then why are you
standing? Sit.
Enough. Now take a deep breath.
No more talking.
How do you like it?
- Good.
What are you waiting for?
Go and join them.
- Really. - Yes, go.
Are you seeing your
niece in action?
I had a doubt whether
she was my niece.
Now, it has been removed.
Then, you can keep it
as a memento.
That suitcase was very dear
to me. Why do you want to?
You've to be civilized
in some matters.
OK. I can say nothing
against you.
Do you need all these books?
Those are my field notes, dear.
The ones I didn't need, I got
rid of a long time ago.
OK, then let it be. You
can pay excess baggage.
You've a lot of money.
We were all prepared to go to
the airport with you.
You were prepared, but
when you go there
you'll hear that the flight
has been delayed by 8 hours.
Then I won't be prepared for it.
I can't allow that.
The sun and the moon may work
on time, but the airlines don't.
Madhu! Carry the suitcase.
Here's the suitcase key.
Dear, I had told you that
patience bears fruit.
Here's the fruit. Here, take it.
This has been made by those
who eat the armadillo.
1500 years ago.
- Thank him.
No! There isn't a better
thank you than his smile.
Come, dear.
I forgot to tell you,
I've written a book.
You can call it a travelogue.
An Indian amongst Indians.
The book will be published
in America.
I've been given
a handsome advance.
That means you're
a rich man, now.
Yes, you can say so.
Will you write a letter?
I don't know what I do
when I get lost in my element.
At least a reached safely message?
Yes, I'll do that.
Now, a final duty.
- What's the matter?
Do you know the longest
word in English?
O, yes! I had read
about it in school.
The longest word in the
English dictionary.
Do you know the meaning?
- No, I don't.
Setting little or no value.
To teach this, 29 letters.
Is this civilization?
Let me go, first.
Open it after that.
If someone reads my writings in
my presence, I feel embarrassed.
This is a small message
regarding your hospitality.
Of little or no value.
Bablu! Now, Chotdadu will flee.
Won't you ever come back?
Now, you'll come to me.
And what have you
promised you won't become?
Kupomanduk.
Remember it, dear!
I've done a lot of injustice,
Uncle.
Forgive me! - Were you the
one who did injustice?
Don't I know in what situation
I had put you in?
But there was a reason for it.
What would a passport prove?
Match the name, match the photo.
But that won't teach
you about that person.
You need time for that. There
was the need for that time.
Is there a system of
prostrating, among the tribal?
I haven't heard of it.
- Then, instead of prostrating?
Wait! See what your
uncle has written?
Neeli, this has been addressed
to you. A poem.
Understand the bond
of a blood relation,
the uncle left behind
his share for his dear niece.
What's this!?
My name, Shetalbabu's signature.
Can't you understand? He has
given his whole share to you.
