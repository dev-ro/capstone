What is an adult?
Becomin' one

or significant.
I am 18 and
entirely unremarkable.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Languishing in the wilds
of nowhere, Tennessee.
In this tomb of a house
left to me
by my brilliant
and selfish parents.
They're not dead...
though they pretend I am.
They're permanently abroad.
Literature is my solace
in the solitude.
And writing is my only means
of escape.
Because, you see...
I've never left the edges
of this town.
It's positively gothic,
really.
Lonely girl longs to escape
the interminable boredom
of her small village.
Lonely girl longs
to be meaningful.
Lonely girl longs to be loved.
Books make longing
seem romantic, but it's awful.
It's greedy.
And I wear longing
like a fucking veil.

My parents are lawyers.

You think
that's Boris Fillmore?
Why not?
He's fine.
He's like,
really fucking smart.
And he's kind.
Which means, as my first time,
he'd take his time
to get me all good and juiced.
And then
he'd give me aftercare.
You know,
the first time you have sex,
it's not supposed to hurt.
Right?
Like,
if you're properly aroused.
You likely won't even bleed.
Didn't know that.
That's because a woman's pain
is valued more
than her pleasure.
But that's a conversation
for another day.
My point...
is that Boris has just got it
going on.
I know what I'm looking for.
And I think Mr. Miller knows
what he's looking for.
What do you mean?
I've never seen him look
at a student
the way he looks at you.
He sees you
even though
you hide in plain sight.
-Shut up. (GIGGLING)

He hasn't said anything?
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Oh, well, he said,
"Go to bed."
So...(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(EXHILARATING MUSIC PLAYING)
Take off your shirt.
What?
-Why?
-We are gonna make out.
For him, not for you.
Well, it can be
a little for me.
How is this?
Yeah, good.
Your turn.
(EXHILARATING MUSIC CONTINUES)
Here ya go.
Be a little closer
when I take this photo.
Not like that. What, are you
a fucking Dutch clock?
I meant like this.
Close.
Ready?

BEATRICE: You've been summoned
to the principal's office.
Mm-mm.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
BORIS: You got a title yet?
BEATRICE: Lesser Expectations
of a Greater Love.
(DOOR CLOSES)
-BORIS: I mean, I don't know.
-(BEATRICE LAUGHS)
-(BORIS SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
-Hi, Joyce.
-(LAUGHING) Another beer?
-Mm.
No, I should go.
-I should get outta here.
-Oh, come on.
-Don't be boring.
-No. No.
I got 45 pop quizzes
on thermodynamics
to fail.
And we haven't even gotten
to fractals yet.
Goddamn hopeless youth
of America.
Well, you're the one
who wanted
to make a difference,
remember?
(CHUCKLES) Hey, fools rush in.
-Where's Jonathan?
-Tithing.
All right, well, look,
tell him I had to run.
Bye, kiddo.
BEATRICE: Bye.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Joyce got the story.
What?
Well, it had a "For Jonathan.
Love, Cairo..."
(GRUNTS) ...written at
the top, so, you know...
there's no mistakin'.
And she'd like to speak
to me formally
about the necessary paperwork.
(CHUCKLES) Paperwork for what?
An incident report.
Uh...
I think she did it.
Who did what, huh?
Cairo. Cairo turned it in.
It's a short story, Jonathan.
It's not
The Communist Manifesto.
Mm-hmm. I know.
But, yeah, but,
it's the, uh...
it's the implication.
Why if she can convince them
that somethin' happened
between us, then, uh...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Well, I could lose my job.
That's not all you could lose.
Did somethin' happen
between you?
Nothin' I invited.
(BEATRICE SIGHS)
Teenage girls are dangerous,
Jonathan.
They're full
of emotional violence
-and vituperation.
-Mm-hmm.
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

Have you seen Cairo?
-I haven't.
-I haven't seen her.
And I just thought...
-maybe you had.
-I haven't. No.
-You don't text?
-She tell you we do?
Well, you know...
Cairo says everything...
And nothing.
I don't understand
what's happening.
Don't you, Winnie?
(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)
How did it start?
In your own words.
We recognized each other.
She's exceptionally talented.
Uh, she's singular in that
at this school.
Did you exhibit favoritism?
-Give special mentorship?
-Of course.
He was excited to give me
the midterm assignment
in advance.
JOYCE: And the midterm is what
percentage of the final grade?
It's 25%.
Enough to destroy my GPA.
JOYCE: You do know
that Henry Miller
is not an approved author
for public school study,
right?
She's better than
the curriculum, Joyce.
You know that.
I wanted to help her
stand out.
I think he was impressed
I knew who he was.
Have you read his work?
How often have you
been together
beyond the classroom?
We would see each other
before school,
uh, in class, of course,
and sometimes after.
And what would you do?
We would talk about literature
and things that
we cared about.
Sometimes we'd share
a cigarette.
We happened to be smoking
in the same place one time.
And that, well, that...
That's how it started,
I guess.
Not...
I mean, that is how
we started smokin' together.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Do you see each other
socially?
Absolutely not.
We went to
a poetry reading together.
JOYCE: Would you consider
yourself friends?
Without question.
We are as close,
uh, as is appropriate
for a student and a teacher.
Have you ever been
alone together
outside of school?
Only a couple of times.
Y... Yes, sort of.
Uh, I mistakenly left
with her phone
from the classroom,
and I returned it to her, uh,
before my wife and I
went on a business trip
to Nashville.
We didn't actually go,
but, you know,
we were going to go.
He came to my house.
Were you alone?
Yes.
My parents were out of town.
What happened?
Why?
She say somethin' happened?
Nothin' that didn't seem okay
at the time.
I returned her phone.
JOYCE:
Did you go inside the house?
I didn't touch her, okay?
Um...
When she sent the story,
I told her it was not
appropriate for school.
(SIGHS)
(GULPS)
I'm gettin' the impression
there's nothin' I can say,
uh,
to defend my position here.
JOYCE: 'Cause there isn't.
(PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING)
BORIS: Jonathan...
are you in love with her?
Fuck Almighty. Are you?
It's not about my feelings.
It's what she implies.
And you know I could get
crucified for this...
-BORIS: Oh, fuck me.
-...while you're sittin' there
swiping through pictures
-of naked students.
-Oh, he's so smart, everybody.
That's why I deleted it.
You deleted it.
-Oh, good.
-No. No.
(SARCASTICALLY) Well, as soon
as you delete somethin',
of course, it means
it's really deleted, right?
-Come on. Jesus.
-Oh, I'm shakin'
in my fuckin' boots.
You know the difference
between you and me?
You cannot identify the line.
So, you cross it.
Right.
That's why
you're sittin' here scared,
defensive.
You are the adult.
Show some responsibility.
You can't be serious.
-Like you?
-Yes.
I know where the line is,
Jonathan.
-Mm.
-I don't cross it.
You see, knowin' the line
is knowin' the risk.
You tryin' to make me
your collateral damage.
You don't know... Oh, man,
you think
you're my collateral damage?
(SCOFFS)
-All right, man. Just go, man.
-All right. No, no.
-Yeah, all right. I will.
-All right, yeah.
-Cool, bro. Mm-hmm.
-Thanks for your help.
Appreciate that.
(PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING)
JONATHAN: I've been suspended.
Did you fuck her?
No.
-(SNORTS)
-Then what happened?
She impressed me.
I gave her preference.
She handed in the story,
which I obviously
could not accept.
Her feelings got hurt,
and she lashed out.
-That's how I understand it.
-Hm.
So you flirted with her,
-and then, you rejected her.
-JONATHAN: No,
-it wasn't flirting.
-What was it then?
-It was affection!
-(CHUCKLES)
Well, are you
attracted to her?
(JONATHAN EXHALES SHARPLY)
I'll tell you.
This is about a girl
who flattered you,
who read your little book,
and your inevitable surrender
to adulation.
You fucking fell for it.
Finally. Finally!
Someone gave your reductive
short stories a second glance.
And you can't help
but get hard for it
because, what, now suddenly
you feel worth somethin',
is that it?
Yes!
She made me feel
worth something.
What does that tell you?
Was it her sycophancy
that got you hard?
Or was it the smell
of teen spirit?
-Fuck you.
-Oh, be my guest.
Stop. (PANTS)
-Did you?
-No, I didn't fuck her.
Why do you look so guilty?
I haven't done anything wrong.
-Oh, didn't you?
-(BREATHING HEAVILY)
God, I'm in hell. (CHUCKLES)
Well, make yourself at home.
Why are you so punishing?
You wanted her.
I can read it all
in your face.
How can you see anything
in this state,
you fuckin' alcoholic?
It's the only thing
that makes you bearable, baby.
You are a cunt.
And you're a liar.
Liar!
You're the banner boy
for mediocrity,
waving your flag
of spotless virtue
like some middling
American hero.
But, Jon, baby...
you're the villain.
But you can't even see that,
can you?
Don't you worry for me at all?
What would I possibly
worry about
other than dying of boredom
having to listen to
your inventions of conflict?
You...
are...
vile.
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
Why don't you write about it?
Spit it out, Winnie.
What are you doing?
I'm completing
my admissions essay.
Is that all?
Well, I'm smokin' a cigarette,
if you wish to be
very literal.
What are you doin'
to Mr. Miller?
I'm testifyin' against him
in front of the school board.
-Why?
-He underestimated me.
I overestimated him.
Are you okay?
I'm inspired.
-That's not funny.
-It is.
A little.
-Please don't do this.
-Why?
You're gonna ruin his life.
And for what?
To avenge your rejection?
To punish him?
Because
he didn't wanna fuck you?
He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.
(SCOFFS) Yes.
But he didn't leave his wife
for you.
I'll testify against you.
No, you won't.
Excuse me?
I'll show them the evidence
I have against you and Boris.
And not only will your
credibility be shot to shit,
but you'll incriminate him
as well.
Two teachers
can lose their jobs.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
Oh, hey,
maybe we can double team.
You played me.
You knew what we were doing.
This is not what I meant.
Isn't it, though?
Didn't I play it out
exactly like you imagined?
This isn't a fucking game,
Cairo.
You're right.
This is, to date,
my greatest achievement.
