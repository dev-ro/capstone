And we are back, in living color
 with our exclusive interview
 of the president of
 the United States,
 Richard milhous Nixon
 Mr. president,
 just before the break,
we were discussing the impending
 impeachment investigation.
And I guess we're all wondering,
 how are you feeling
 about your ability
 to defend yourself
 against the charges?
That's very interesting to hear
you say that, Mr. president.
It begs the question
is it paranoia
if indeed everyone is
coming after you?
You can just drop it
on the floor for now.
- Hey, Christine.
- Hey...
Are we interrupting something?
No, I was just running some tape
on myself.
Oh, it's the new quad machine,
sorry.
- Hey, Jean?
- Yeah.
Have you ever noticed that
i do this thing when I...
I nod a little
too sympathetically
when I'm interviewing a subject?
No.
How can you be too sympathetic?
I don't know.
 It feels forced.
 Hey, I think I'm gonna cue up
 the interview for the zoning
 piece.
Can you look at the film intro?
 Yes.
Have to run down here,
I'm gonna need your help
in the studio.
Hey Chris, is it cued up?
- Yes, it's cued up.
- Alright.
- Your stomach still acting up?
- Yeah, it's just stress.
So I was thinking
we'll go, film intro,
and then go to graphics
and then jump into this?
Yeah, we don't need
that film intro.
- Let's cut it.
- Are you sure?
No, this is good
this is solid as it is.
 ...at least put it to vote.
Because while we wait, there are
 kids who are suffering.
The whole of Florida suffers...
Stop!
Rewind.
How come?
It's that lean-in there,
i just wanna see it.
Hey, I was wondering...
If you have time after
the show tonight,
could you take a look something?
I took your advice,
I've been trying to
put a story together.
Well, I have my volunteer shift,
and then dinner,
but tomorrow maybe?
- Yeah, alright.
- Okay.
 ...or at least put it to vote.
Because while we wait, there are
 kids who are suffering.
Yeah, right there. Stop.
See that?
You don't think that's...?
No.
...forced?
No, it's fine.
You're listening to them.
Have you noticed the gal
who's been putting fake flowers
on the table?
Oh, yeah.
Mike asked her to.
Wayne!
They're like silk or something.
How is our new,
very expensive quad look.
I don't know yet,
it's still in the box.
Let me know when you get it up
and running.
If it doesn't work,
I'm not paying for it.
Ladies, team meeting,
five minutes?
Copy five.
I mean it!
"I mean it!"
"Five minutes, ladies."
Steve, what's going on
in your world? How we look?
Orlando's looking at
a big storm tonight,
so it'd be great to get
an extra 10 seconds.
It's gonna have to come
in the lead then, George?
The lead-in's ten long as it is,
and I've got fat to trim all
over the rest of the show.
- Okay, I'll keep working on it.
- Just came in.
Fire just called.
Pickup truck went off the road
on orangeville.
Chubbuck, can you
get out there please?
No, sorry, I can't.
What do you mean you can't?
I'm tucking in
that hospital piece.
I need more time.
You're shitting me.
I thought you finished
with that last week.
That was part one.
What is with this
zoning obsession of yours?
It's inane.
No, it's important.
People could be dying out there.
Mike,
it's Fender-bender reporting.
It's demeaning.
I have been very clear that
I am doing issue-oriented or
character-based pieces.
...make it very, very clear.
- Thank you for your clearness.
- Okay.
It's too dry!
We gotta liven things up
around here.
Ratings are
in the fucking toilet.
I can be on that real quick.
All the film rigs
are out anyway.
Take one of the akais.
The akais don't work.
They work, chubbuck,
you just refuse to learn them,
which reminds me, everybody...
September the first!
Everybody in this room!
September the first!
Mark it on your calendars.
We're all video by then.
There's no excuses.
- Yes?
- Yes.
No excuses!
Jean, do you mind
getting up there and
picking up that footage?
No, I'm on it.
- Mike...
- Yes?
Bob's on the phone.
Bob, Ford dealership Bob?
No. Bob Bob.
Station owner.
Fuck.
Tell him I'll be there.
Tell him I'll be right there.
Tell him
I'll call him right back.
Mike,
you should go take that.
Probably just calling to tell me
he's gonna come down here
to put us out of our misery.
Bob Anderson,
deigning to visit us.
That'd be something.
Will he be traveling
by spaceship or unicorn?
Okay, quick.
Sports. Kirby. Go.
Get your curlers out, Kirby,
- we're on in 30.
- Thank you.
"...quarterback among
his two men..."
They're gonna skip that...
That's good.
Thank you Gail.
Anytime, George.
 In other news,
 there was a car accident
 on the 301 this morning.
What time do we have
Christine in the line up?
5:20.
5, 4, stand by...
Take vc1.
 The erratic flight patterns
 of a pelican...
 - End quote.
 - Stand by...
 The resulting pile up
 fortunately
did not result in any injuries,
 but did back up
 south-bound traffic
 all the way to Santa fe.
 Driving conditions are
 now normal.
Jean, I changed my mind.
We need to add film of me
walking the county line.
I don't think we can.
We're up in 3 minutes.
Godamnit, chubbuck!
Gimme a minute, I'll grab it.
How's that graphic looking?
I don't know, I like it.
...the meetings will be promptly
 at 7:30 pm.
 And we're told that cookies
 and coffee will be served.
- Ready camera two.
- Stand by.
 And now let's kick it over
 to Steve Turner
 - at the super computer...
 - Moving on to weather!
I shaved
a couple of seconds off the top.
We're good, let's go.
- Keep camera two.
 - Thank you, George.
Tell George to stretch.
Tell George to stretch it.
Camera two, go to a two-shot.
You really mucked things up with
that rainstorm last week, huh?
Like any new technology,
it has its kinks.
Just kinda makes you look
like a liar, Steve.
Well, I think you know
that I'm not, George.
I'd like to see you
jump over here
to the hot seat
one night, see how it feels.
That sounds like fun actually.
I'm sure it does.
As always...
Vty is open ladies,
whenever you're ready.
Okay...
Here it is.
It's starts halfway
from my pinkie.
My asshole is like this
right now.
Like this.
I'm going, copy, copy.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
Master load graphic at vt1,
load film on film 2. Trt is
35 seconds, sound on film.
Put interview at vt2.
Sound on film...
And now, in a special edition of
the sarasota suncoast digest,
an ongoing investigative report
 from reporter Christine
 chubbuck.
Christine?
Thank you, George.
As you know there's been
some controversy
with several of the hospitals
up near longboat key.
I sat down with councilman and
zoning board president
tom d'esposito
and some local
health care professionals
for an exclusive interview
to talk about it.
And how it ties into
what might be
a larger crisis in sarasota.
A zoning crisis.
- Projector 2.
- Rolling on film.
 You can't see but I'm standing
 on the line that divides
 manatee and sarasota counties.
There's a proposal on the table
 right now,
 to move the line up
 a fifth of a mile,
 so that
 the sunshine children's home
 and other facilities like it
 are eligible for
 more state funding.
 However discussions,
 like this railway track,
 have come to a dead end.
 Mr. d'esposito, this is the
 fifth time in as many months
 that re-zone proposal has gone
 forth before the board?
 Is your plan to
 postpone a vote again?
 What's your message
 to residents?
 And to the workers at
the sunshine children's center,
and the children in their care?
 You fill up my senses
 like a night in the forest
like the mountains in springtime
 like a walk in the rain
 like a storm in the desert
 like a sleepy blue ocean...
But miss tangerine...
Yes, see saw, darling.
How do you know
if it's a stranger,
what do you mean?
Well, what if you know them,
but you don't really know them?
Then what?
Well, that is a tricky question,
see saw, darling.
If you've spoken to them
more than once,
then they're not a stranger,
and it's probably okay.
Well, thank you, miss tangerine.
You're welcome, see saw.
Thanks, kids.
Thank you, kids.
That was wonderful!
Can everyone thank
miss Christine?
Thank you, miss Christine!
Alright,
it's dinner time everyone.
Hey Stevie,
i have a good one for you today.
Knock knock.
Who's this?
Harry.
Harry who?
Harry up and let me in,
it's cold outside.
Alright, it's dinner time,
kiddo.
- Good-bye, miss Christine.
- Bye, Steven.
Thanks again, Christine.
Of course.
You know, I was a little torn,
I know most of them don't even
leave the grounds ever, so...
No, it's all helpful.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey, Miranda...
I've been having these...
Awful stomach pains,
right down here.
Could you maybe
have a look for me?
Honey, I'm a pediatric nurse.
I'm not really qualified.
That might be
in your lady parts.
You should call a doctor.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Well, it's probably
just stress anyway.
Sorry I'm late, roomie.
Hey, it's okay.
Long day?
Long day.
I was stuck behind this guy
on the 41...
We were not moving at all,
it was crazy.
It's okay, don't worry about it.
Can I have the usual?
The show was great tonight.
No, it wasn't.
They're always put me
at the back of the line.
It was great!
Hey, who did the graphic for
the zoning crisis?
That was wild.
Yeah?
Well, it was my concept.
But Jean did the graphic,
i let her do the tech stuff.
So...
How were things with
"gorgeous George" today?
Don't be weird.
...we're still not speaking.
- What's all this stuff?
- I know, I'm sorry.
We're out of storage
at work and
frank asked if I could keep
some of it here,
just for a week or so.
Rent's due tomorrow,
don't forget this month.
I won't!
Jeez!
- Hey, Chris?
- Uh-huh?
Have you thought anymore about
what you might want to do
on your birthday?
Trying not to think about it.
At least let me take you
to dinner.
We could go to davenports.
Maybe you could invite George?
I have to get to bed.
Come on, Chris,
i was just kidding around.
No, it's fine,
I just have to
get up early tomorrow
to grind out a piece
before Friday.
Good night, mom.
 Oh my god!
Frank delmonaco, Miami action 6,
got an 8 with this.
An 8.
He beat out reruns of
"all in the family."
They got a 7.6.
What, you're reading
the numbers now?
I always read the numbers.
It's called rounding up.
Michael, why do I have
to be here for this?
- I do sports.
- This is a "team meeting".
It's a simple concept, guys.
"If it bleeds, it leads."
There's a reason this idea
is catching fire
in the culture right now.
But they didn't show that,
Mike, they cut out
just before it.
If they'd had the guts to show
the whole thing,
they could've doubled
their rating.
There aren't sniper standoffs
in sarasota,
we're not Miami.
Also, "if it bleeds it leads"
is not some concept, Mike,
it's a catch phrase
that you picked up
at that conference in Cleveland
last month.
Chubbuck,
this is not debate club.
This is a joke.
This sort of thing,
it'll make us a joke.
Mike, I'm gotta side with
Chris on this one.
Steve...
You do weather.
We're the joke, chubbuck, okay?
We're the joke.
You read the numbers?
Tell me, chubbuck.
Tell us all.
What did we do last month?
We are drowning here, guys.
Abc isn't kicking in
what they promised this quarter.
The last round of local ads
didn't hit,
so people aren't re-upping.
I know this is all just
fun and games for you,
you're all breezing through here
on your way to
a national market.
But the situation
is getting fucking dire.
Hear me when I say that.
We need higher ratings.
How do we get them?
Juicier stories.
It's simple math, guys.
That's not math, that's logic.
 Here we are at the 5th annual
 sarasota strawberry festival.
Hey, chubbuck.
You ready?
A or b...
"The salmonella
can seemingly be traced to
"poorly packaged chicken
from..."
Or...
"The authorities believe that
the salmonella originated..."
Are you okay?
Why?
Do I not seem okay?
You're not upset about Nelson,
are you?
No.
You can't let him
get inside your head.
Can he even hear himself
sometimes?
He just gets all grumpy
because he's got
Mrs. Mike Nelson back home
waiting for him.
Use the "authorities" line.
Make people feel like someone's
steering the ship, you know?
You're okay?
I'm okay.
I'm okay, you're okay, right?
Alright.
 At the strawberry festival...
 Here we go, folks,
 the first strawberry of
 the season.
 They are juicy.
 So Sharon, what can you tell
 me about the festival?
 Well, this is our fifth year.
 We've been doing this since
 1969.
New in town, huh?
Yeah.
About a year.
I used to vacation here
as a kid though...
Yeah.
You were in Boston
before this, right?
- Great city.
- Yeah, but Ohio originally.
So...
How long have these pains
been going on for?
Oh, I don't know,
about a month or two.
Probably just stress.
Probably.
But better safe than sorry,
right?
We'll take some blood and
urine, and do a pregnancy test.
A pregnancy test?
Okay, sure.
Good luck with that.
Been a while, huh?
Oh, you could say.
And...
I think we'll do some x-rays,
so we need to schedule
a follow-up for next week.
That alright?
Absolutely.
Whatever you need.
Says here someone's got a
birthday coming up, huh?
Oh, yeah, don't remind me.
The big 30, huh?
Put your feet up
in the stirrups for me, please.
Sure.
Alright.
Now slide down.
Slide your hips right down to
the edge of the table for me.
Thank you.
 ...this is nbc nightly news,
 reported by John camel...
 The house judiciary committee
 voted today to make public
 all the classified material
 it has amassed in seven weeks
 into the inquiry into the
impeachment of president Nixon.
 The vote was 22 to 16,
 with 16 democrats and
 6 Republicans
voting to release the evidence.
Anything else while you wait?
No, no.
Long day.
I guess I've been stood up.
That's rough.
I'll just take the check there.
Hi, hi.
Sorry to interrupt.
I couldn't help but
notice you back there.
You both seem to be
very much in love.
Thanks.
We are.
How long have you been together?
It's our third anniversary.
Oh...
Wow...
You must think I'm crazy,
my name is Christine,
I'm a reporter at wzrb.
And I have a
community affairs segment
called the suncoast digest.
And I'm always on lookout for
positive,
human-interest stories.
Ah...
Here.
Let me give you my...
You wanna call me...
I can't guarantee that
you'll make it to air, but
why not give it a shot, right?
"Okay, lady, we get it,
let us get back to our dinner."
I'm really sorry to interrupt.
You just made my night.
Don't lose sight of
what you have here.
Okay?
 Words...
 Matter...
Chris?
I'm so so sorry I missed dinner.
I got a little tied up at work.
You could've called
the restaurant.
I know, I...
Got a little distracted.
Frank had us do inventory.
 You have to learn
 how to stand up to him.
I know, I know.
You wanna hang out?
No, I think I'm gonna get
to bed early.
You sure?
One hundred percent positive.
...goddammit.
Somebody grab the phone.
Are you freaking out?
I am freaking out.
No. Why?
It's the worst possible time
for this to be happening!
Is your computer
acting up again?
My computer is more than
acting up.
It's taking over my mind.
But I'm in the booth,
talking it over with
the Japanese tech guy,
and that's no small feat,
"the circuits are flied..."
I swear we are just about
to break the whole thing wide,
I'm talking countries
coming together here, Chris.
And Jean busts in
like I'm in a bad dream
and tells me that
i have to get out
because Mike is
giving Bob a tour,
and I'm just úreally Jean?'
wait.
- Bob?
- Yeah.
And now I have to stand up
in front of an empty map
with nothing to say like
a goddamn birthday clown.
Bob andersen?
Yeah. Bob fucking andersen.
Are we having
the same conversation?
Jean?
Hey, Jean!
Jean!
Hurry.
Yeah.
- What do you know?
- About what?
About what?
About Bob andersen.
Nothing really, he just came by.
It's crazy, right?
I think he's with Mike
right now. Hey...
I keep meaning to talk to you
about something.
Communication.
 ...Bob Anderson...
Yes, chubbuck,
can I help you with something.
I'm sorry...
I...
I just wanted to let you know
that I've been getting
a lot of calls
about that strawberry
festival piece.
Great!
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Now I'm serious...
Are we taking a
championship this year?
I this might be
the year, George.
There you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,
a bold prediction from
our own Andrea Kirby?
And that's all
we have for you, sarasota.
Stay tuned for police surgeon,
followed by the national news.
Until tomorrow.
And we are out.
Thank you, everybody.
Great show.
Who's thirsty?
Yeah, let's go to that place
across the street.
Bob andersen
was watching from back there.
Yeah so...
Everybody's freaked out
about it.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you...
- Good work, guy.
- You too, Steve.
No, I saw him wave...
Did he say anything to you?
Did he talk to you?
He didn't talk to anybody,
he was working with Mike.
Oh...
So that's how it feels
to have everyone's
attention and respect.
What's going on here, Mike?
Calm down, Steve.
What do you mean
"calm down," Mike?
We are talking about
all of our lives here.
Why didn't you tell us
that he was here?
I didn't know he was coming
any more than you guys.
He flew down this morning,
called me at home,
asked to have lunch.
Mike, are we going to be
shut down?
In defiance of any logic or
common sense,
I can discern...
He's here to see if he can poach
some on-screen talent.
What do you mean, "poach"?
He's not shutting us down.
He's actually picking up
another station in Baltimore...
Wkrb.
So I guess he's doubling down on
this whole news thing.
Wait, so he's gonna hire one of
us to work in Baltimore?
It's a top-30 market.
I love how quickly
you've all moved off
your fear of getting fired.
If he takes one of you,
it's gonna be
a royal pain
in the ass for the rest of us.
Who's he gonna take?
Steve, I have
no fucking idea, but
he's gonna be hanging around
for a couple of weeks,
working on this and a couple
of other real estate deals
he's got going on.
He's even offered
to host our 4th of July party.
But believe me when I say
he'll be watching.
Mike, you always host
our 4th party.
Yeah, well...
Things are gonna be
little different this year.
Good night, kids.
Baltimore.
That's so close to NY.
That'll be huge.
Hey, maybe he'll
take a couple of us.
That'd be a fun road trip.
Hi, Mike.
No knocking, chubbuck.
Do you have a minute?
Sure.
Check this out.
I'm watching
an action 6 aircheck
from last month.
They're doing
a series on fat people.
People addicted to junk food.
You know, like twinkies?
They're trying
shock therapy now.
Can you believe this?
 Okay.
 We're going to ask you do
 a couple of things.
 Alright.
 I'm gonna turn the machine on
 and at first you're not
 gonna feel anything at all.
 As a matter of fact,
 the machine is on right now.
Mike, level with me.
I haven't led
in over a month now.
Tell me what I have to do
to get to Baltimore.
Why not try to get me
something like this?
Because this is totally at odds
with the work that
I've been doing, Mike...
It's exploitative.
Then why are so many people
watching it?
The people you're so concerned
about representing are
the ones that are gobbling
this stuff up.
We're supposed to know
better than them.
That's a pretty superior
attitude to take.
It's on the job description.
You asked me a question,
I'm answering your question.
So what?
Get some footage of some
fat people
burning in a car crash
and I'm on a plane to Baltimore.
Is that what you're saying?
Now you're being smart-ass.
What's your problem,
miss chubbuck?
You're a feminist.
You think that
the way to get ahead is
by talking louder
than the other guy.
That's the whole movement
in a nutshell.
Oh...
So you saying that I'm not
fit for a bigger market
cause I'm a woman.
No, I'm saying that
there's no respect
for institutions of authority.
You're the smartest person here.
If you took half the energy
you use to give me a hard time
and just did what
I'm asking you to do...
I'm just trying to understand
what you saying.
Jesus Christ, just
make your stories juicy.
But I thought
people were supposed to like me
for who I am?
That it's what's on the inside
that counts?
They are.
But you have to show them
who you are.
How do I do that?
Well, you do it
with your actions.
You act boldly and bravely,
you put on nice clothes,
you wake up every day and
you tell people who you are.
You use your body language.
You use your words.
So what I say can count too?
Yes, it can.
Sometimes it can.
Thank you, miss Christine.
Okay, come on.
Christine, you're bigger
in real life, taller.
Really, I didn't
recognize you...
Don't mind him.
He's on a damn drunk.
Maybe I can get your autograph
on the way out?
Frank!
You have a celebrity visitor.
So I'm looking to run some
grittier stuff for my segment.
Grittier? Okay.
Well, you know.
Crime is on the rise.
In sarasota last month
there were at least
2 armed robberies
and 4 burglaries.
That was an anomaly.
If you look at the charts,
it's pretty even.
I wouldn't say it's rising.
Well, maybe not rising.
But it is here.
I think people are a little
too happy to ignore it.
Did something happen
to someone you know?
Cause you can tell me.
No.
I just need a...
To show the darker side
of sarasota
find a darker angle, you know.
For what it's worth,
miss chubbuck,
I think your show is great.
You do these think pieces.
They're so positive.
I love coming on.
Well, I appreciate that.
Captain, people are really
listening to me.
So I need to make sure
that I'm really
saying something.
...paranoid and crazy...
Oh, hi honey.
I need a minute, peg.
What's in the box?
Can I come in?
You're smoking pot out there,
and you know how much
i hate that.
It's my day off.
Please let me come in.
I want to talk to you.
I heard you talking about me,
if you have a problem with me,
you can say it to my face.
No, Janice.
Janice, from the yarn barn.
I'm sure you were.
Chris...
Will you stop looking at that?
What is that, a ham radio?
It's for work.
What?
I'm making shark steaks
for dinner.
I was hoping to talk to you.
Well, we're talking right now.
What?
Christine?
This isn't the start of
one of your moods, is it?
You can tell me. I hate
to see you go through that.
Peg.
Jez...
Moods.
What is it?
It's just...
You're sounding a little
like you sounded
at the end of
your time in Boston.
Yeah, well, I'm fine, okay?
What?
I have some news.
I met someone!
His name is Mitch.
He came into work
a few weeks ago.
He lives in bradenton.
Okay.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to be happy for me.
I'd like you to meet him.
Well, why don't we
give it a few weeks?
Historically, these things don't
always go as planned with you.
Christine, I know
that's not you talking.
It's whatever you're
carrying around right now.
And I think you should
apologize to me.
Christine!
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't say
things like that to you.
It's just you didn't even ask me
what's going on with George,
or anything and it's like...
Whoah, whoah, whoah.
I wanted to talk to you
about it the other day and...
And now
you're telling me all this,
and it just feels like gloating.
Oh, oh, my god, no!
I'm sorry,
i should've checked in with you.
Do you really see that
or you're just saying that
to shut me up?
No!
I can totally see
where you're coming from.
Okay?
Can I give you a hug?
That usually seems to help.
Thank you.
I guess I didn't know how much
i needed this.
Thank you.
Of course, honey.
You can always talk to me.
I'm your mom.
That's what moms are for.
Okay.
 If you could just go over
 the island park,
 there's those kids
 that've been loitering
around the last couple of weeks.
 Shine your flash light
 or whatever. Over.
 1315...En route...
I'm at fifth and pineapple now,
 heading back toward main...
 Did you get that
 1120 under control?
 Whatever that was.
 What was that?
 1315, yeah,
 just a couple of kids,
 we flashed the lights,
 they finally took off.
 You want to hear something
 on a happier note?
 Yeah, yeah, please do.
 I finally touched marine's
 pussy last night.
 What is going on
 in Brian's fucking life?
 I don't know what can I say?
I hate my job, I hate my family,
 I hate my fucking brother.
 Now we're getting somewhere,
 now you're opening up, okay.
 Good evening, 1021, 3215,
 3275, 3250,
 respond to a 1055 in progress
 at sycamore and orange.
 Sycamore and orange,
 there's a 1055 in progress,
 sycamore and orange.
This is so exciting.
- I feel like Bob woodward.
- Ah-hah.
Is this for the zoning crisis?
I'm not exactly sure yet, Jean.
We will find out.
What's going on?
- A fire.
- Oh my god, a fire?
Yeah.
Find where
the good angles are, Jean.
You want the oricon or the akai?
Ah, oricon.
Oricon, color film.
I have a feeling
this is going to be special.
Hello, sir.
Christine chubbuck...
I'm a reporter from wzrb.
This is some fire.
Can you tell me
how it got started?
I really don't know for sure.
I just know bad things
have been happening to me.
Okay, okay...
Can you stay here
for one second?
I will be right back.
Jean?
Chris.
I'm gonna get an establishing
of the trailer.
- You wanna check frame?
- No.
We don't need it,
we need to shoot this guy.
Okay, but...
We can frame him up
with the fire behind him.
No, we have to frame up
on his face.
Real close.
 I fell asleep last night
 with a cigarette in my hand.
 But I do check the smoke
 detector quite regular.
 I'm grateful my wife got me
 into that habit.
 I woke up,
 I heard the alarm go off.
 I ran quickly outside
 to the front lawn,
realized I forgot my cigarettes.
 And I ran back in.
And when I ran into the kitchen,
 two canisters exploded,
 and ignited.
 And that's how I did this.
 You know...
 That's the third time
 this happened this year.
 I hope they don't, but...
 I think they're gonna cancel
my homeowner insurance tomorrow.
A man driven back
into a burning house
by a primal need
to feed an addiction.
An entire community, imperiled.
A sad story,
but not one without hope.
What does it mean?
Real floridians.
Real stories.
This is Christine chubbuck
with your suncoast digest.
Thank you, Christine,
for that story.
Next up after the break,
the sports report
with Andrea Kirby.
And after that,
sales of "lemons"
are on the rise
in western Florida:
Bad cars from bad dealers.
A special report on
what's looking like an epidemic.
And...
We're on a break guys,
back in 60 seconds.
Hey Mike,
what'd you think?
I was trying to tap into
some real suffering.
It wasn't a story.
The guy burned himself
going back in for cigarettes.
Mike, that was exactly
what you've been asking for.
It was raw, and the man
had an irony to him.
We're not making irony,
we're making news.
I mean where was any footage
of the smoldering house?
At least that
would be something.
You just showed his face.
But his face was burnt!
You showed a guy talking.
Mumbling actually.
Guys!
I got to get out of here early
go pick up my wife
for the party!
I'll see you all at Bob's!
No shows will be fired!
Darren, you're in charge!
That guy was
a real pistol, huh?.
That was real different, Chris.
It wasn't supposed
to be different,
it was supposed to be good.
And we're back
in 30 seconds, guys!
 From the whole gang
 here is wzrb,
 happy 4th of July, sarasota!
 Yeah!
Andrea, welcome to the party.
I don't know if you remember me,
but I'm Michael's wife.
Yeah.
Of course, I remember you.
Have you seen this place?
It's like their second
or third house.
And it just sits here
most of the year.
I mean...
It's just wild.
Oh god.
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.
- Dammit, every goddamn time.
- Sorry.
Come over here and
drink some coffee, please.
Oh-oh, here comes trouble!
Steve's had a few.
Jean...
How bad was that...
Honestly?
I liked how it came together.
I thought Mike was
way too hard on you.
You don't think Bob andersen
was watching, do you?
I don't know.
But it was good.
Don't worry about it.
Hey Turner,
you keeping it together?
You know what, George?
- One of these days...
- Yeah?
I'm gonna test you.
Yeah, I'm gonna give you
the test, you'll see.
I'll study.
You should.
I will.
Good.
Hey, chubbuck, I found
a pool table in the den.
C'mon.
What?
Okay.
Here you go, Mr. andersen.
But it's not Andrea.
Now that was some report
you gave today.
Thank you, George.
Strange.
Interesting.
I liked it.
Okay.
Tell that to Mike.
Jeez, just take
the compliment, chubbuck.
It's good stuff
you do in the field.
I wish I could get out there
and do something like that.
Make an impression.
No one on anchor wants to be
in the field.
That's what
people in the field think.
Still stripes.
You and I have been working
together for over a year now,
and we've never gone out and
had a drink together.
Well, I don't really drink.
You know what I mean.
Well, you've never asked me.
You're not always the most
approachable person, chubbuck.
Well, I am approachable.
Maybe you just don't know
how to approach me.
Oh? And who does know
how to approach you?
A lot of people.
Jean...
Steve...
You're funny, chubbuck.
People are just so funny.
Take Mike and Mrs. Nelson.
Something drew them
to each other, you know?
But now?
God.
It's like we all have these
different versions of
ourselves competing
to be the real us.
You ever think about
stuff like that?
It's your turn.
I don't think
I'm very good at this.
Sometimes,
I'll be daydreaming at work,
and I'll just gaze off
and imagine like this
big wad of shoelaces, you know?
Like in a box.
All tangled up.
Different colors too...
Grey, black, red,
neon, orange...
A big ugly knot.
And that's...
My life.
I don't think we're so
different, you and me, chubbuck.
I think sometimes maybe we make
things too hard on ourselves.
I think you and I might have...
Something to offer one another.
You know
we're not alone out there.
Well hello, you two.
Well hey, soldier.
You just get here?
I have...
A lot of work
to be doing so,
I should go.
Hey, chubbuck, just admit
this was a little fun.
Sure.
Good night, George.
So what's the game?
Pool, dummy.
Happy 4th, Mr. andersen.
Hey, chubbuck, aren't you
gonna stay and watch?
No, I just have to
say goodbye to someone.
The fireworks is starting...
Mom?
You home?
 I'm telling you man
 you got to take it to tug.
 I'm telling you, I don't trust
 an outside guy with my gun,
 specially not tug daiss.
 It's pronounced "dice."
 ...it's the
 daiss auto service center.
 You've never seen "daiss"
 on the side of the building?
 Yeah, I dunno about
 that guy, he fixes cars,
 he fixes guns,
 he just fixes stuff.
 It's like if I had
 a sandwich shop,
 and you came and I said,
"today we're selling blowjobs."
 That's why you see him.
 He's crazy.
 He's a real character.
 His stories are fuckin'
 hilarious.
 I don't find him hilarious.
 I find him pretty
 disturbing, to be honest.
 That is the touch, my friend.
 Look, he's there from 4 to 8.
 You do what you want to do.
 Anyway, let me tell you
 how it went with Betty,
 last night, alright?
 So we go back to
 her place, but
 she's raring to go...
I thought I was just stressed.
Is it from stress?
It's hard to say.
It could be.
It could be genetic.
As we get older,
our bodies do things to us that
we can't control.
Well, I have been stressed.
You know, if you're stressed,
we can give you something
for that.
Give me something?
I have in your chart
you used to take trazadone
as an antidepressant.
I didn't like the way
they made me feel, okay?
I would really appreciate it
if we could stay on topic.
This is very...
Unexpected.
Look...
It's great
we caught it so early.
It's very manageable
at this stage, we just...
We need to take it out
in the next few months.
The cyst.
The whole ovary.
It's the only way to make sure
the issue doesn't recur.
But it's a very
manageable surgery.
It's tantamount to having
your tonsils out.
The only issue is, of course,
it can create complications
should you
want to conceive in the future.
Are you saying
if I have this treated that I...
I won't be able to have...
That I have
two months to have a baby?
I'm not saying that at all.
You will only have
one ovary so...
It just...
Might require
a little coordination.
 And we want our residents
 to partake,
 but they need to get on
 that waiting list quickly.
 We can't help it if
 we've turned this into
an attractive destination for
retirees and non-retirees alike.
You know Florida is the place
you want to be.
We have sun, sand, surf,
championship golf,
great cuisine, culture.
Everything you could imagine.
Everybody wants
to come here right now.
People are coming here from...
Sorry, can we stop
for a second...Jean?
- Yes.
- Stop, can you...
Can you get Gail?
I thought she was meant to get
some fresh flowers.
Yeah, I told her to,
it must've slipped of her mind.
It slipped her mind?
Well, I can't think
about anything else.
Sorry...
You're gonna have to...
Someone get some fresh flowers!
 Okay, I'm sorry, sir.
 We just gonna have to wait...
 A little bit, I'm sorry.
 I'll be right back.
Chris?
Hey, Chris.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Just...
Summer allergies.
Oh.
But...
Are you, you know...
Okay?
What do you mean?
You just seem a little more
wound up than usual.
What do you mean?
Like, tense.
No.
You said more than usual.
A little.
But you just seemed like
you got really upset out there.
Hey...
Do you want to get out of here?
Where?
Why don't we just go
play hookie?
Jean, don't be weird.
I'm serious.
Look, when I'm bummed out,
I like to go to eat ice cream.
It's a little trick I learned
when things are starting
to be too much,
I just get a cone and...
This is gonna sound stupid,
but I sing.
Along with a song on the radio,
or whatever,
it doesn't even matter.
Come on, it's my treat.
I have a lot of work to be
getting on with,
so I should do that.
We should get on with my work.
I'm sorry, sorry, but...
Can you sign me an akai
out for me?
I need to learn it.
Know what,
I'll go get the flowers.
Okay.
Sir...
I'm very sorry.
And we will pick this up
at a later date.
Okay, thanks, Christine.
My source at the police station
called it
"the tug show" actually.
- He said that?
- Yes...
He did,
and how did you get into this?
Into this business
with the police?
After Jimmy suskind comes out
here with a busted up cop car,
started fiddling with
his pistol,
says it doesn't shoot straight.
So I said give me your keys
and your pistol.
He said, "i ain't gonna
give you my pistol."
I'll take it for one day
and get it fixed for you.
It'll have it shooting
straighter than
a pecker in a peepshow.
He says, "alright."
Hey, madman,
take care of the front office,
I gotta take care
of a little business.
Here we go.
There you are.
Come on in.
This is it.
And...
All of these guns
belong to other people?
Only about half of 'em
I'm working on for other people.
Others, I sell to friends.
Yeah, the rest of them
are mine though.
And...
Ahh, how about that one there?
- What's that?
- That one there?
That's a bad boy,
looka there.
That's a .44.
Yeah, it's loud,
got a big kick.
It's got a lot of weight to it.
It's a damn monster.
Here, hold it.
- Really.
- Oh yeah, come on.
It ain't loaded or nothing.
There you go.
Holy cow, that's heavy.
Here.
I had no idea that
so many people
carried guns down here.
Oh sure.
Now this a .38 special.
My momma carried that
in her purse.
It aims for shit, but it's good
for close contact.
We just got bullets for those,
called "wadcutters."
They explode on contact.
Stop a threat dead
in its tracks.
I didn't know that
sarasota was a
town known for its threats.
Oh yeah, there's threats
everywhere.
There's a fever settling into
this country, miss chubbuck.
Can't you feel it?
You gotta be ready
to protect yourself.
Be aware.
You're living in
condition white.
"Condition white"?
When you're sleeping.
When you're home,
tucked in your covers.
Condition white sounds nice.
It's a victim's mentality.
Condition white is for sheep.
Condition yellow...
That's when you are
aware of your surroundings.
You're yellow when
you leave the house.
There's a bird.
There's a car.
Most people live and die
in white and yellow.
Carrying a gun on you
usually jumps you
right up to orange.
That's the next level.
That's where you want to be.
That's when you're aware of
your surroundings
and of threats.
And...
What happens after orange?
Well, that's red.
That's when you see the threat,
and you're ready to
take an action.
You carry one of these around
with you for a few weeks.
You'll see.
Changes things.
Why are you so bad?
Why are you so bad?
- Don't...!
- It's going to be nothing!
 Hi, you've reached Jean Reed.
 I'm probably not here,
 or if I am, I'm...
That's great Wayne, re-rack it,
cue it up the preview.
Will do.
- Is Mike in his office?
- Yeah.
Oh, that is a great shot.
Yeah, I thought so.
The shoe's been
in evidence for a year,
with blood all over it,
they completely missed it.
I love it. I love it.
You've got some pep
in your step.
Yeah, I think
I've got something.
Look out for it.
Michael, I have some footage
that you need to see right now.
I think its really gonna blow
your hair back.
We're always fighting, you know?
But I think we're actually
saying the same thing.
You want flash and pizzazz,
and that's fine.
You know what?
Who am I to say that's not okay?
There's drama and tragedy
and suffering all around us.
I just want to really
get to know these issues
and the people behind them.
We need to put it in context.
The mistake we've been making is
not doubling down on the idea.
We need to go deeper.
Wayne? Where's Wayne?
Wayne!
I'm not following.
I am saying,
let's get ride of this
pedestrian idea of the news.
So-and-so did such-and-such
at this place and time...
It's so cold.
Let's really examine it.
And there's a subjectivity
to those stories
we're not tapping into.
We need to go
inside people's homes.
Really spend some time
with them.
Plant cameras.
Heck, give them the camera
so we can see what's going on
behind closed doors,
cause that is
the big question...
That we're all running around
here trying to answer,
what would it be like
to be someone else?
They did this chubbuck.
It was called "American family,"
it was on pbs last year.
I thought about that, Mike.
Wayne?
I need you, Wayne.
So I'm thinking long form,
docu-journalism
with little movies
to fill in the gaps.
Movies on the news?
Yes.
Wayne, Wayne, come on.
Stand by, I'm coming.
Cue it up.
People just watch stuff, Mike.
You know, a never-ending parade
of stuff
to distract themselves
from their miserable lives.
So I mocked up
something like
a domestic dispute
and a home invasion.
It's a little rough.
So, try to follow me here.
 The door is unlocked.
 Hey, you never leave
 the door unlocked.
 Are you home?
What you're seeing here is
a dramatic rendering
of the moment a
roommate comes home and
realizes that her friend
isn't home when she should be.
 She's usually home
 by nine o'clock.
This is based on that case
last year where
that girl in Reno was
abducted from her dorm room
and no one reported it
for over a week.
We've got more standard
talking-head interview
which will go right in front.
But then we just jump into this
and we don't make
a big thing out of it.
We just do it.
What is that, a knife?
What I'm looking at?
The exposure's off,
we'll adjust that.
Jean wouldn't come out
and run camera with me so...
It's a little too much
to do for one person.
Christine?
Why are you even here?
Look, chubbuck, this is...
Interesting, but...
I think you need to
develop the idea more.
I'm punting
the chicken lady tonight,
why don't you take
the rest of...
If you're punting
chicken lady anyway,
I should go on and announce it
on coming attractions.
Jesus Christ!
I'm punting the chicken lady
to make room for the
serial killer from gainesville.
It's gonna lead.
What?
Who?
Young Jean Reed, here.
She's been working as
an extracurricular activity.
Doing really good work.
Real grisly.
Exclusive stuff, too.
I tried to tell you
about it, Christine, I swear.
Is this a joke?
We do local news,
gainesville isn't local.
He's at large.
He could be anywhere.
Well, I didn't know
those were the rules.
There's no rule book, chubbuck.
And I don't need
your permission.
Excuse me.
I never wanted to do
a chicken story anyway!
Good, I'm glad we agree.
You know, Mike, just because
your wife has a drinking
problem,
doesn't mean you get
to treat me like this!
That's on you,
don't put it on me!
That's on you!
I'm just trying to do my best
for this station!
And it isn't easy!
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
You fucked up again!
And now you insult me?
You insult my family?
I got half my savings
invested in this station.
I believe in it.
What do you believe in?
What are you doing
to make a mark?
Okay.
I'll do the chicken lady.
But there's gonna have to be
some changes around here.
Christine!
Go home!
Have you even seen the flowers
that Gail has put out for us?
They're fake!
Mike, just fake!
Sums up the whole operation!
Running our own cameras
in the field.
We're a joke, Mike!
We're not real!
 We're a joke!
 I don't know what's going on
 with you right now,
 but you need to get
 the fuck out of here!
Chris, what happened?
You okay?
 I'll have the complete
 weather picture for you
 at 5:20 on channel 30
 weather watch.
 Watch yourself sarasota
 with the channel 30 news team.
 Meanwhile, sit back, relax,
 and enjoy our afternoon.
Hi, Chrissy.
You're home early.
Aren't you on air tonight?
Oh my god, it would seem not.
We were gonna surprise you,
making an apple pie.
Your favorite.
This is Mitch,
my friend
i was telling you about.
Honey, I'm Mitch.
Your mom has told me
so much about you.
Peg, can I talk to you
for a minute?
Alone.
Nice to meet you too,
sweetheart.
Mitch.
Christine, we have company.
Now, please.
What is going on with you?
What is going on with me?
Where have you even been?
Mitch surprised me,
we went to key west to a hotel.
Are you kidding me?
What about work?
Honey.
Here I am,
just drowning under water,
and you decide to
take a romantic getaway
without telling anyone?
What are you, fifteen?
- What happened to you?
- What happened to me?
My mother abandoned me
for four days and
now she shows up
out of the blue
with some stranger that
she's gonna have
sex with in my house.
Our house.
Our house that
i pay all the rent on
while she stays at home
and smokes pot!
Christine, that's not fair.
My life is a cesspool!
I'm so, so sorry the smell
is inconvenient for you.
It must be very, very nice
to have an escape hatch.
You are scaring me, it's
getting to feel like Boston.
What is this?
"Bring up Boston" month?
I'm in pain here.
It's that simple.
Baby, I can see that.
What do you want me to do?
Tell me what to do.
Look at me. I'm here!
But him...
Forget about him.
I like him.
Look at me. Look at mom.
You have these moods, baby.
You know you do.
You put all this
pressure on yourself
and this is how it comes out.
Can you see that?
For a second.
And I'm not always equipped
to deal with it!
 Maybe you should go back to
 Dr. benolken for a little.
 You liked him.
 That is a temporary solution.
 I need to fix my life.
My life is the problem.
What? He's answering
the phone now?
She's indisposed right now.
Can I take a message?
Yes, could you tell her that
Jean called?
And that I...
Wanted to talk to her.
And that I'm her friend,
and I'm sorry.
Alright.
Can you just ask her
to call me back.
Okay.
Just invite him
to move in with us?
Maybe I will.
Maybe I'll move out.
Oh, the truth comes out!
Cause you want me
to act like this!
I don't know what to do
with you sometimes!
You want me to be your mom,
you want me to be your friend,
you want me to be
your punching bag!
I am a person too, Chris!
We're both adults here!
I'm your child!
You were supposed to
figure this all out.
And maybe if you did,
and spared me for one day
your hippie baloney,
I would actually understand
how the world works!
Christine...
I love you...
Look, look, let's just
take some breaths.
Why would you love me?
It's weird that we live
together. Just say it.
I won't say that!
We both know
what's going on here, peg.
I got all turned around
in Boston and
I come here to relax
and rehabilitate,
and you're here to babysit me.
It's not true.
It's not relaxing here, peg!
It's a trap here!
These people are ruining me
all over again!
These people...?
Why won't anyone just
listen to me!
 Hello, wzrb,
 this is Gail speaking.
 He's in a meeting right now.
Hey Chris,
did you get my message?
Hi.
Wzrb, this is Gail speaking,
how may I direct your call?
Hey, Chris, I...
Chubbuck...
You got a minute to pop into
my office with me?
Did you want to talk?
No, it's just...
Mondays, you know.
It's Thursday, Turner.
- Just saying, George.
- Right.
Have a seat.
So, how are you?
I'm fine. You?
You didn't seem fine yesterday.
Didn't you ever have a bad day?
Sure, I have bad days
all the time.
Listen...
You wanna maybe
get some dinner tonight?
What do you mean?
You know, fork, knife,
plate, food... dinner.
I don't get it.
Chubbuck,
I'm not gonna bite you.
I feel like we're always about
to make some breakthrough
to some new level of
connectivity
but something gets in the way.
Dinner?
Yeah.
And then maybe afterwards,
i could take you somewhere...
Somewhere where we could talk.
Well, I...
I'm gonna have to think
about my schedule.
Don't think,
just say what you want to say.
It's a little more
complicated than that.
Why don't you just say...
"Yes."
And usually
we can harvest about
200, 300 eggs in a day.
And they go
straight out to market.
Well, that's fascinating.
Maybe you can get us
some footage
of the chickens having sex,
so people can see
how the eggs are really made.
I'm kidding.
That's a joke.
We can edit it out later.
I was going to say,
I've seen it, it ain't pretty.
Oh, well, I can only imagine.
I'm going out, peg.
You're talking to me now?
How do I look?
Really nice, actually.
I have a date.
You have a date?
Guess who with?
No.
No!
Baby, I'm so happy for you.
Yeah.
Hi, George.
Why hello, Christine!
Shall we?
I thought you didn't drink.
For the most part, I don't.
Special occasions.
Like easter.
I'm surprised that you
remembered that about me.
I didn't drink for
a really long time.
Just easing back into it.
Sometimes I still slip up
and overdo it.
If you told me a year ago
that I'd be sitting down
for a one-on-one dinner with
Christine chubbuck,
I would have told you
you were crazy.
I would have, too.
I mean, I don't mean me,
i mean about you...
Having dinner with you.
Right?
I understood what you meant.
So why haven't we been able to
just sit down and have a dinner
like this together, huh?
Well I...
I can shut people out...
Even when I don't mean to.
I know how that feels,
Christine.
Believe me,
i know how that feels.
Thank you.
If you believe it will happen,
it will happen.
Right.
My mom always says stuff like,
"thoughts become things,"
and mostly I just tune her out,
but I really think
that if I just
harness all the energy
that I have
and put it into getting back
into a major market, then...
I'm rambling...
I'm rambling.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't usually drink.
It's very pretty, where are we?
This is where
i went to high school.
Really?
Yeah, I'm a Florida boy.
Never left home.
Failure to launch.
You can't be hard on yourself.
I was an all-star
quarterback here.
Starter, three years.
I took a bad tackle
in college,
and messed up my shoulder,
and couldn't play anymore.
After my injury,
I couldn't see the future.
I felt like
a train off the rails.
Not a lot of people know this,
but I got really into cocaine.
Bad stuff.
It's the only way
i could feel alive anymore
because, in many ways,
i was dead inside.
But then one day,
I met a man named Marvin lammer
here in town.
You ever heard that name before?
No, no.
Marvin saw what
was going on inside of me
as plain as day.
That my definitions
were all wrong.
I see the same thing
going on with you.
The same thrashing around.
What is this?
We call it "ta."
Short for
"transactional analysis."
It's sort of like...
Group therapy.
Don't be scared.
Put your trust in me.
Howdy George,
we're just about to start!
Everybody,
this is my friend, Christine,
who I was telling you about.
Everybody please say hi to
George's friend, Christine.
Hi, Christine!
We were just about to
start a round of "yes but"...
Crystal, Jim,
could ya'll split up.
Crystal,
you work with Christine,
and Jim,
you can work with George.
Just give it a shot.
Okay.
It's best just to dive right in.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Maybe we set aside
some time later,
so we talk a little about
the broader process,
- uh-huh
- okay.
- Hi, Christine.
- Hi.
- I'm crystal.
- Hi.
I know this can feel
a little bit funny,
but just try to relax and
let it wash over you, you know?
We're gonna play a little
exercise called "yes but."
I'm going to be black and
you'll be white, okay?
Basically you're just gonna
tell me a problem
that you've been having,
and I'm going to
try to come up
with a solution to that problem,
and then you counter that
by saying,
"yes, but..."
For instance,
"i need to lose weight."
I would say, "why don't you
join an aerobics class?"
And you would say
something like,
"yes, but I can't afford
the membership fee." Etc.
Got it?
And...
This is gonna help me?
Yes, in a way.
In time. You'll see.
Would you like to
give it a shot?
Sure.
Whenever you're ready.
Well...
I really wish that
i could get a job promotion.
Why don't you ask for one?
I already have...
Yes, but...
Yes, but I already have.
They said I have to do
different work.
Why don't you do different work?
Yes, but
if I do different work then
I won't be doing
the work that I love.
Why don't you try to compromise?
That just makes my stomach hurt.
Yes, but...
Yes, but...
That just makes
my stomach hurt.
Why don't you see a doctor?
Yes, but I have.
He tells me I have to have
an operation.
Well, why don't you have
the operation?
Yes, but if I have
the operation then...
I won't be able to
have children.
Then why don't you
have a baby then?
Yes, but I...
I haven't got the man I love
to fall in love with me yet.
Why don't you have a
different man impregnate you?
Yes, but I can't have sex
with just anyone,
I haven't had sex at all.
I'm a virgin.
Why don't you try to
adopt a baby?
Yes, but I've always
wanted to have a baby.
And I've always
wanted to have a husband and
I've always wanted
to have a job where
I can do the work that
i want to do.
Why don't you
manage your expectations?
Maybe...
Adjust your thinking?
I don't...
I don't understand the question.
Christine, it works.
I promise you.
Once you learn your life script,
it really just
becomes okay.
Can I tell you something?
I'm gonna tell you something.
I want you to hear it
from me first,
I've known for a couple days but
i haven't told anybody yet.
I'm going to Baltimore.
To anchor...
For Bob andersen's new station.
What?
How?
Bob andersen came up to me
at the 4th of July party,
and told me I had a
steady, paternal presence.
Then just like that, bam,
I'm going to Baltimore.
Just like that.
I know you were jockeying
for a spot up there, but...
This just goes to show
if a dumb quarterback like me
can get where he wants to go,
so can you.
Believe me, Christine,
you have so much passion
and integrity,
you're bound for
even bigger things.
Chicago...
Hell, New York City!
I believe that.
I really hope you can still
help me with my copy.
Maybe we can do phone calls.
Phone calls sound good.
Good.
Okay.
- See you at work.
- Yes, I will see you at work.
Yes, thank you for dinner.
- Can I help you?
- Hi...
Forgive me,
I've blown a flat tire
outside of your house and...
Mr. andersen?
Is this?
I didn't realize
this was your house.
I'm sorry, do I...?
It's me,
I'm Christine chubbuck,
I'm a field reporter at wzrb.
Oh, hi!
I thought I recognized you.
Would you like to come in
for a minute
and use the phone?
Thank you,
that'd be very nice.
Now I was just having
a little midnight snack.
Excuse the mess, I haven't
had a chance to clean up.
You wanna use the phone?
I might need just to take a
second here,
I'm a little shaken up.
Sure, sure.
Did you happen to catch any
of our reporting while you were
here the last couple weeks?
Not as much as
i would've liked to.
I was mostly tied up
with construction
on the other properties
i own down here.
I always try to do
informational pieces...
Community affairs.
I should show you
a clip sometime.
Have Michael send me a tape.
You know our anchor, George
Ryan?
Yes.
He's the anchor.
He and I have
a terrific chemistry.
I should try to find a piece
where we're
at the desk together.
You'll know what
I'm talking about.
That sounds fantastic.
You see the way the anchor
shuffles his papers there?
That seems like a tic but...
Actually he's added that
consciously to his delivery.
I think it makes people feel
more comfortable.
George and I, we have that same
attention to detail.
I guess I never saw that before.
I mostly just keep this on
for company.
I feel like you were
maybe leading up
to a question there.
Did I miss it?
I've had a few.
I'm going to cut to the chase,
Mr. andersen.
I'm not supposed to know,
but I have heard
that George has been promoted
and is going to Baltimore,
and I want to know,
if you're still looking for
another news person.
If the qualities
that I have mentioned
are important to you...
Oh, well...
We've already hired our quota.
That little
blonde number in sports...
- Andrea?
- Yeah.
Andrea.
Firecracker.
She's going to Baltimore?
George suggested
that they go together,
and I said, "well...
"Sounds like fun,
what the hell."
But the door is always open.
I always leave the door open
as policy.
I just try not to overthink
these things too much, you know?
My wife likes
to read the papers,
watch the news.
She and I took a vacation
down here once,
she liked it.
 Bam!
I bought the news station.
Bam! I bought this house.
See what I'm saying?
Follow your gut.
Exactly.
And leave the managing
to the managers.
Life is hard enough
without dwelling
on every little thing.
And man, is it hard.
And that's...
The liquor talking...
Which is
another problem I have.
But there's only way out...
Forward.
 Hon?
Honey?
Hi, peg.
Baby, your alarm's been
going off for an hour.
I don't think
I've ever seen you oversleep?
Was it a late night?
Oh...
Yes.
Well, great!
See, you were
just lonely, right?
But you feel better already.
You always come through
these funks.
Move in circles.
By the way, I went ahead and
made a reservation
at Davenport's
for your birthday.
No pressure,
we can always cancel.
Miss tangerine?
Miss tangerine?
You are not saying anything,
miss tangerine.
What would you like me to say?
I don't know.
I like it when you talk to me.
What if I don't have
anything else to say?
You mean it's
okay to be quiet sometimes?
Yes, see-saw,
sometimes it is.
Can I be quiet with you?
Yes.
See-saw, you can be quiet
with me.
Morning, Jean.
Hey, good morning, Chris.
Frank...
George.
George Ryan.
Chris, can you get
this vo done by noon?
Oh, the children's hospital
called.
Okay, sure.
...using it when it's...
Come in.
Hey, Mike.
Do you have a second?
Chubbuck.
Can we have a talk?
I can go.
No, stay actually.
I would rather you stay.
So, two things first,
I got the scratch vo for that
piece about the camp site
from yesterday.
We're kicking the can on that.
I have to run this fucking story
about the bowling alley
going under.
Okay, sure.
You just tell me.
I will.
The second thing is...
I'm just going to
come out and say it.
I want to ask your permission
to lead a story from the desk.
You are not leading.
Mike...
You know what?
Don't, he's right.
You're right,
i know, I have been a...
Real bear lately.
I can see that now.
Look, Mike...
I know we're in a less than
ideal situation here together.
You're not going anywhere,
and I'm not going anywhere.
So I would like to wipe
the slate clean.
I'll read anything you like.
What is this?
What are you doing?
I just been thinking
a lot about...
Your idea of...
Sensationalizing the news.
- That's not what I'm saying!
- Mike, listen.
I'm agreeing with you.
I just got sidetracked
for a second there.
I should've fired your ass
for your tantrum the other day.
You should have,
but you didn't.
If I mess this up, I'll never
ask for anything again.
Cross my heart.
I mean, Mike, come on.
Mike...
I don't know.
No one's watching us anyway,
remember?
Ha!
You can report whatever comes in
over the weekend.
Whatever I say.
Thank you.
I mean...
You say "please," it's nice.
"Please" I can work with.
 We're not trying to
 prove psychic powers,
 but let's see if
 you can pick up the image
 which I'll tell you
 at the end of the program.
 Alright? Ready now?
 Begin...
 Time.
Oh, hi Chrissy.
As you were.
As you were.
 The name which
 I can see engraving...
A sheet of paper...
She seems better.
She does, doesn't she?
 With your eyes
 closed of course...
She's my favorite person.
You're my favorite person.
Get over yourself.
That's great.
Okay, good...
Let's keep it simple.
Let's use 10 or 15 seconds
at the top.
- Okay, are you sure?
- Yeah.
Can you...
Can you make sure that
Darren is recording
the show tonight?
I'll want it for my reels.
I will go out of pocket for it.
Alright.
Hey, Chris...
You wanna go to lunch?
Maybe tomorrow.
Okay. Rain check.
Okay, everyone,
we're getting close.
Let's get ready.
Chubbuck's big night.
 This is news watch at five

I'm George Ryan.
To begin our broadcast tonight,
- we turn to Christine chubbuck
 - gimme camera 2
with a report on
some upsetting events
that occurred over the weekend.
Christine.
 Take 2.
Thank you, George.
An 18-year-old man
named James whitworth
was stabbed this weekend
in the parking lot of
the starwood tavern
on 27th street.
 The event occurred
 at roughly 4:30 pm on Sunday.
It's unclear how the altercation
 that led the stabbing began.
The conflicting reports citing
a financial disagreement and
an argument over a relationship.
 Ready, projector one?
Police and ambulance were...
One is not gonna run.
What? No!
No, go fix it.
Go fix it, Kenny!
Godammit!
Who's name has not been released
at this time...
Tell him...
Flag anything that needs film.
And we'll bump up anything
that's on the quad.
We go now to exclusive footage
of the crime scene
just moments after...
What do I do?
Tell George, godammit.
It's jammed.
It isn't going to roll.
It isn't going to roll.
Here we go.
Come on, Kenny!
 It appears that we're having
 some technical difficulty.
 We had wanted to show you
 some film from the scene,
 but I'm sure that if you...
Kenny, where are you
with the projector?
- ...you'll be able to catch it.
 - Keep swimming.
So...
Now...
In keeping with the wzrb policy,
don't give up on it.

And complete reports of

Very funny, Christine.
Oh, my god!
Oh my god,

Get a towel, get anything!
- Gail!
- She's breathing!
Get on the phone!
Get on the phone right now!
Calm down now...
I know you're scared.
Gotta stay calm.
Everything's going to fine.
Christine.
Christine.
Sir...
I'm gonna need you to
put that down.
Sir, I'm sorry, this is
an active crime scene.
You gonna have to put that down.
Respiration is shallow...
Bring it in, bring it in.
No information.
Would someone just...?
I'm sorry, there's no paperwork.
Mrs. chubbuck?
Yes.
I'm Jean.
You're Jean, from the station?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
How she is doing?
What's going on?
What did she do?

Oh, my god!
I'm really sorry.
I'm okay.
You're okay.
I'm okay.
You're okay.
Repeat it, say it.
Say it, say it!
I'm okay...
...and shot herself in the head
 while the program was
 on the air.
 30-year-old Chris chubbuck,
 is in critical condition
 tonight.
Seconds before shooting herself,
 miss chubbuck told TV viewers
 "in keeping
 the channel 30's policy
 "of bringing you the latest

 TV 30
presents what is believed to be
 a television first.
 In living color
 an exclusive coverage
 of an attempted suicide.
The woman host of a TV talk show
 in sarasota, Florida,
 Chris chubbuck,
 today read a news item
 about a local shooting,
then told her viewers they were
about to see a television first.
 She pulled a gun from
 a shopping bag
 and shot herself in the head.
 She's in critical condition
 at a sarasota hospital.
 In other news tonight,
 vice president Ford said today
 that Watergate has
 this country deadlocked
 on its
 major domestic problems
and that something must be done
 to break this impact.
 In California,
 the vice president said...
Scratch vo for
Christine chubbuck memorial.
Christine chubbuck
was born August...
August 24, 1944...
Okay, Chris...
 My name is Christine chubbuck.
 And I'm a field reporter at
 wzrb.
 What kind of cracker
 do you call her?
 Come on...
 Chickens are very serious...
 An entire community imperiled.
 ...begs the question
 is it paranoia if everyone
 is indeed
 coming after you?
 You can just drop it
 on the floor for now.
 Hey Christine...
 Are we interrupting something?
No, I was just running some tape
 on myself.
 It is a new quad machine.
 Sorry.
 Hey Jean, have you noticed
 that I do this thing when I...
 I nod a little
 too sympathetically
when I'm interviewing a subject?
 No, how can you be
 too sympathetic?
Hey, pepper.
Hey, sweetie.
 Good evening.
 President Ford told a
congressional subcommittee today
that there was no deal, period,
 involved in the pardon
 of Richard Nixon.
 Mr. Ford's appearance
 before a subcommittee of the
 house judiciary committee
 has no precedent in history.
 He is the first president ever
 to testify voluntarily before
 the house of representatives.
 And the message he brought was
 that his swift and unexpected
 pardon of Mr. Nixon
 was done only because
 resignation and punishment was
 enough,
 and because the country had to
 focus on other problems facing
 us.
Here are some of the main points
 the president made
 in a two-hour session.
Our nation is under the severest
 of challenges now
 to employ it's full energy
 and efforts
 in the pursuit of a
 sound and growing economy,
we would needlessly be diverted
 from meeting those challenges
 if we as a people
 were to treat its opponents
 as enemies must never,
 never be tolerated...
