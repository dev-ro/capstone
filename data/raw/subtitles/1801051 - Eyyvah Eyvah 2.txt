EYYVAH EYVAH 2
-The girl's here?
-Yes.
Well, go give her the ring then.
See how well the box goes with it?
What's wrong?
Abla, I can't do it!
-Do what?
-Give her the ring.
Why? She's your girlfriend, isn't she?
-She doesn't know that.
-How do you mean?
I haven't, like, talked to her yet.
How can I give her the ring?
What am I doing here then?
I thought the girl liked you.
You said we'd be going to ask
for the girl's hand. Didn't you?
-Yes.
-Well?
Well, something will happen in time.
I mean, I have that feeling.
Give back my ring then.
Just kidding!
You believe anything, local yokel!
OK, then. We've come this far,
so go and say hello to the girl.
Yes, OK.
Go on! For goodness sake!
And check this one out.
Watch, watch!
-What happened?
-Nothing. She's busy, doing stitches.
-Doing stitches?
-On a guy who cracked his head open.
''How you doing?'' I said.
''Fine,'' she said. ''You?''
''OK,'' I said.
''See you later then,'' she said.
So I'll see her later.
Come on, let's go.
-Still eating sea urchins?
-Aha.
I can tell.
Excuse me, do you have this
with a pocket on the front?
I have it in green, black and red.
-Well, do they have pockets?
-No. They don't either.
-I see. You mean, get the message.
-Huh?
Nothing.
Abla, don't drag it out.
Just pick one. They're all the same.
OK, OK.
One of these then.
?aban Abi, are these the kind
that dry right away?
Whoa! It's you, Huseyin!
-Yes!
-Hey, my man!
-How you doing, Spaniard?
-Fine, great.
How come you're over?
I'm back for good, you know.
Listen, is it true what I heard?
They said your dad's alive.
You tracked him down in Istanbul.
Yep, all true. Without Firuzan
I'd never have found him though.
I'll introduce you. Firuzan Han?m.
She's truly a great musician.
She's my guest, staying at my place.
Right, Firuzan Abla?
Hey, come on, Huseyin.
Drop the 'Abla', will you?
He does it out of respect, you see.
-I say drop it as well. I'm ?smail.
-Firuzan.
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.
No one knows him as ?smail round here.
We call him Spaniard.
Hey, there's a wedding on tonight.
Come and play with us.
I know. Melek already asked me.
Of course I'll play, my man.
Are you crazy?
Thanks, my friend. But if you play,
will we be good enough for you?
Abla, he's a great musician.
Used to play with Co?kun Sabah!
Ah, you worked with Co?kun?
Well, I tag along.
Great to meet you, Firuzan Han?m.
-You too, you too.
-See you tonight, Huseyin.
-Bye then.
-That's 10 lira, right, ?aban Abi?
-Ciao.
-Ciao.
Abla, are you done? You picked one?
Yes, here. I'll get this one.
How much is it?
Don't worry, it's OK. Please.
You're a guest. Come on!
-But, Huseyin!
-Abla, please!
-Take it out of this, ?aban Abi.
-Don't you have change?
-No!
-Grab some flip-flops then.
What does that make it?
And grab a hairclip.
How much are we at now?
Forget the hairclip, grab a hat.
I don't want to spend my money
on stuff like this!
But I don't have change, Huseyin.
Pay me later then.
For goodness sake! OK.
Halil, it's disrespectful to the man.
At least have a few words with him.
You've said nothing since he arrived!
What am I supposed to say to him?
He can talk to me.
Where's his mind been all this time?
We have one grandson and this is his dad.
What's done is done.
Go on now!
-How you doing?
-I'm fine, thank you.
Well, there you go, Ali R?za.
There's no telling
what life has in store for us!
You're right, Halil Abi.
Take me. I always wanted to be
an officer. But I never got to be one.
-That's fate for you.
-Take you. You never got to be anything!
-I play the saxophone.
-Well, you're not playing now!
Know what? If you played,
you'd make a fortune.
It's wedding time here right now.
You'd be raking it in!
Welcome.
You can sit by the mayor.
-You shouldn't have!
-It's only small.
Huseyin Abi's over there.
Welcome, my dear Mujgan Han?m. Welcome!
Thank you.
-That's the girl, right, bum fluff?
-Yes.
Hey, she's beautiful too.
Go on, go and talk to her!
Abla, the captain's next to her.
So? What's the captain going to do?
Haul you into the army?
I'm watching for a suitable moment.
Don't give me suitable moments!
Go on, get going.
Go on!
Evening! Mr Mayor..
How you two doing?
-Good. How you doing?
-Good. Congratulations on the wedding.
-Thanks, Huseyin Abi.
-Thanks.
-Hopefully you'll have kids too.
-Hopefully.
Well, let's hope then. God willing.
Huseyin!
Yes, Mr Mayor?
-That's great, you found your father.
-Thanks.
-Hey, aren't you playing tonight?
-Well, I have a guest from Istanbul.
We'll take care of your guest, son.
Here, let me introduce you.
The town's new doctor, Faruk Bey.
-Hello.
-You know our Mujgan already.
Yes.
Hello there, friend.
I've heard nothing but praise for you.
To be honest, I'd love
to hear you play tonight.
-Thanks. I'll play then.
-You play then!
Yes.
-Hey, aren't you drinking, Ali R?za?
-No, I'm taking medication.
Well, don't then!
I'm Cetin Y?ld?r?m Ate?.
The mayor.
It's an honour to have you here.
It's an honour to be here, Mr. Mayor!
How d'you find our town?
On the internet!
Sorry, just kidding, Mr. Mayor.
I do hope I live to see
my Huseyin married!
-Ali R?za, is the place yours or rented?
-Rented.
I see.
Imagine, we have Troy to the right,
the Temple of Apollo to the left...
...Mount lda behind. History all around!
In a word, unbelievable beauty!
Yes, right.
We grow rice, cotton, vegetables...
And olives, of course.
It's fantastically fertile land.
And we do livestock too.
Lovely. What animals do you have?
-Mostly goats.
-Wonderful!
Boss, let's ask Firuzan Han?m
to sing a number.
OK.
Yes, now we have a surprise.
I have a guest here, Firuzan Han?m.
She's a talented singer from Istanbul.
Let her come and sing us a song
in that beautiful voice of hers.
A round of applause for Firuzan Han?m!
What a sweetie, thank you.
Thank you very much.
First of all, let me wish
the young couple happy times.
And I'd like to sing
a romantic song for them.
And also for Huseyin, of course.
Ah! What cuteness!
Yes, let's have a C minor, please.
Please, if you wouldn't mind.
Let's sing all together 'Eyes are made
for smiling, so why the tears?'
And I'll ask all happy couples
to take the dance floor.
Come on, guys.
OK.
It won't fit through, Halil Abi!
It will, Ali R?za. It will!
Just push, go on!
Halil! The man's tired from his trip.
He's just out of hospital.
You can do it later.
The household's grown, Hatice!
We need it.
Push, Ali R?za. Push!
Oh, do what you like then!
Push! This way. There, you see?
Now what's that there?
-A camel.
-A bird.
An ostrich then.
Look, it's so tall!
There's a man on the back of the bird.
Tall with hair like a girl's.
-Where?
-Look.
Right, I see. There, yes. Well?
This long-haired man
is your destiny, girl!
No, really? So he's on his way
on the back of an ostrich!
You say the sweetest things.
-Look!
-I've seen, I've seen.
God, granddad!
First the carriage, now the motorbike.
Where am I supposed to find
an 18mm nut?
Hey, Huseyin!
Did you find that nut?
Still looking!
Even if I find them,
how do I know which is an 18mm?
I'm not a goddamn mechanic!
Oh my God! God!
Run! There's bees!
Run, run! There's bees in there!
Hornets!
Dad, don't get stung! Bend over!
Don't get me stung as well!
Don't be scared, son.
-They made a nest there.
-Ouch, wait! Ouch!
Oh God!
Morning!
Look, I'm OK. Check him out.
He's sick. We don't want him dying.
-I'm fine. I didn't get stung.
-What were the bees doing there?
Oh, Halil!
Ouch! They got me on my heel!
Look, excuse me, doctor.
I wass stung by a lizard as a child.
I came out in pimples all over.
You think the same thing
will happen all over again?
How did a lizard sting you?
Lizards don't have stings!
You were just freaked out
by its feet.
Oh, don't!
I'll write you all a prescription
for anti-allergy pills.
-I don't take pills!
-Why not?
-I choke when I swallow them!
-Good grief!
Do you do teeth? I have awful trouble
with my teeth, son.
Fix me a tooth, will you?
What's this?
I rubbed on tomatoes
to take down the swelling.
You should've broken
a couple of eggs on top!
How do you mean?
Don't tomatoes do any good?
No. Well, you got off lightly.
It's incredible, the whole family.
Take a holiday with this man
and you have to be prepared for...
...all kinds of thrills and adventures.
That's my Huseyin for you.
But I don't get it.
Why do you say tomatoes do no good?
Mud works too.
Listen, maestro. Blow your pipe
and leave those things to us, huh?
-You need anything else?
-No, my dear.
He's come between us
like a thorn bush.
There's nothing I won't do
to mess him up. Just you see.
Tomatoes do no good, huh?!
He thinks he can humiliate me
in front of Mujgan.
Shame on you too, Mujgan!
I'm not getting any younger either.
I'll never love anyone again!
No, come on. That's just not true.
Well, I doubt it.
Is the water cold, I wonder?
Who calls their nurse ''my dear'', Abla?
Hmm.
What do you think I should do?
Not so fast. We'll think of something.
Isn't that your guitarist friend
down by the water there?
Aha, it's Spaniard.
Hey, Spaniard!
How you doing?
Ah, the sea looks so inviting!
Let me take a dip
to cool down, Huseyin.
Hello!
-What's the water like?
-You get used to it once you're in.
OK, let's get used to it then.
Bravo, Abla!
Is that your bright idea?
You're saying
go bang on the girl's door.
What's the deal? Knock on her door,
say how you feel and be done with it.
Where's the problem?
Look, Firuzan Abla. The house
is owned by Karabacak Kadriye.
She lives downstairs.
Mujgan's her tenant.
She's the worst gossip.
I tell you, everyone in Thrace
will find out in minutes if she hears.
Karabacak Kadriye?
What, from the family of wrestlers?
-Huh?
-Nothing.
Go on! Go talk to the girl!
I'll be waiting right here. Go on!
-Move it!
-What did you do, God damn you!
You should've hurled a rock
while you were about it, boss!
Throwing a fist-sized stone at glass!
Stoning the devil, were you?
Come on, drink up, drink up!
He runs fast for his weight, though,
I'm telling you.
Wait a second, hold it.
I sent the doves flying
I missed my chance with the nurse
No matter what strangers say
I've outstayed my life
OK, all together!
I sent the doves flying
I missed my chance with the nurse
No matter what strangers say
I've outstayed my life
Shame on you, Spaniard!
Abla, he wants a laugh, right? See
how he whips up that song in seconds.
Pay him and he'd never do it!
-No kidding! You just made that up?
-Well.
-Ah, that's so cute. Cheers!
-To you too.
Where the hell
did this doctor come from?
It's a mystery, Huseyin Abi.
The man's been a dark horse
since he arrived. Right?
We don't have the first idea
what he's like.
He doesn't talk to anyone, boss.
It's home work home.
Beats me how he was at the wedding.
I know the story there.
He's a sly one.
He's secretly hitting on Mujgan.
Just thinking about it pisses me off.
He's asking to get his face smashed in!
Huseyin, just calm down.
How about we take the doctor out?
He'll open up with a drink. And click,
we'll see what makes him tick! Huh?
Playing with words again, I see.
Click, tick..
You'd come up with a song
just like that, huh?
Hey, wait, hold it.
He's right.
Why don't we take him out?
Let's take him out.
Tomorrow's Sunday, right?
-Huh.
-Yes.
Oh right!
You know, you put me to shame, boys.
Not at all, doctor.
You deserve some fun too.
Just kick up your heels.
Huh, Huseyin?
Sure, yes.
Huseyin Abi said
let's take the doctor out.
He said you should see Ayazma.
And drink the ice-cold spring water.
Right, that's what I said.
And thanks, you agreed to come.
I tell you, it'll do me
the world of good.
Did you bring your instruments along?
Yes, we all did.
We'll do polyphonic for you.
Bravo, bravo!
That was fantastic, boys.
Thanks.
Doctor..
I see you love this place, huh?
How could you not?
Look how beautiful it is!
I've seen nothing ugly
since I arrived in Geyikli.
They say everything beautiful
belongs to someone, doctor.
Huseyin, beauty belongs
to the person who sees it.
What if someone else
sees it before you?
Seeing isn't enough.
You have to appreciate it.
Come on, let's drink
and get beautiful.
Come on!
Doctor! Excuse us.
We have to take a leak.
Melek, come and take a leak.
But I don't need to.
You will when you hear me.
Come on!
Get going, will you!
You hear those innuendoes, huh?
First it's Geyikli that's beautiful,
then it's the people.
Looking at beauty is virtuous.
It's all about Mujgan.
I can't take it.
I feel like beating him up.
Hey, hold on! He'll start talking
with a few more drinks. Wait a bit.
How's he going to start talking?
He drinks more than us!
He's no doctor. He's an alcoholic!
For God's sake!
Red reishi mushrooms! Oh my God!
They're fabulous grilled, Huseyin.
Wow! Look at that!
These are something else.
I'm talking out of this world.
I don't know how many I've eaten.
I'm about to burst.
Eat up, girl. Enjoy!
We call them 'pi?i'.
Well, do you like this place then?
You think I wouldn't?
I could spend my life here.
Look how beautiful it is.
I like you more than anything, girl!
Sweetheart!
Thank you, dear.
You're taking care of my Huseyin.
Come on, don't even mention it!
He's as good as a brother.
Although he dumped me today.
All in a good cause, of course!
I know everything that's going on.
We'll see. Let's hope for the best.
No, really?
Well, I was a young woman once.
I know about these things, Firuzan.
My boy's fallen in love
with the nurse, hasn't he?
Hatice Abla? I'd call you an old hand,
but I guess that's rude.
I had my time,
but the crows got to me!
Bury me, Ali R?za. Bury me!
My feet too. Bury me!
It won't trouble you
in the heat, will it?
Not a chance!
It does wonders for my bones.
Bury me, bury me. Keep at it.
So, Ramiz. Is there a horse? A horse?
Yes, Halil Abi. But when I'm here
I don't do the horses. I abstain.
Ramiz, there's a camel for sale,
in Ayvac?k.
The man's sick, can't look after it.
We should get that camel, you know.
We'd rake in the money!
-No way! It'd cost a fortune.
-But we can borrow the money.
Soon as we get the camel wrestling,
we'll pay it right back.
But it's money, right?
-Yep, mushrooms coming up!
-Bravo, you guys!
To be an artist is something else.
But it's a tough job
being a musician, right?
You're always at weddings or whatever.
You get drunks, weirdoes.
We love it.
Boss.
Being a doctor's tough too.
A patient dies and the doctor
gets beaten up. All kinds of stuff.
I mean, dealing with so many people
is tough. Being a nurse is tough too.
Especially being in love with one.
It's just up your alley, Huseyin Abi.
Mujgan Abla's a gem, seriously!
Whoa! You mean our Mujgan?
Who the hell is Mujdat?
I'm talking about Mujgan, Mujgan.
Didn't you say you'd fallen for her?
Mujgan...
What's it to you?! Enough!
Are you trying to
wangle things out of me, huh?
You've made life hell for me
these past few days, slimy dog!
-Huseyin, just calm down.
-Why not stick it in writing for him?
It's your fault! You told the guy!
It's all your fault!
What was I supposed to say?
It's you who blabbed to begin with!
Hey, guys! What's going on?
Hold on a second.
Get your hands off me!
Huseyin, my friend. Just calm down.
You and Mujgan.. Whoa, Huseyin!
Don't worry. I won't say a word.
I know the score. Me and my fiancee..
The things we went through for years!
You have a fiancee?
Yes. We talked in secret
for five years before getting engaged.
What did you talk about?
Current affairs!
-Abi, are you engaged?
-Yes.
-How come you don't you wear a ring?
-Gives you fungus in the heat.
Is that so bad?
Look, we're eating the stuff!
Oh no! I was out of order there.
Will you ever forgive me, Faruk Abi?
Don't even mention it.
Besides, I loved seeing you like that.
Well, let's drink then.
Drink, drink, drink! C'mon, Spaniard!
-To your fiancee.
-Drink to Huseyin and Mujgan.
Cheers!
It'll be a big surprise.
I've missed her so much.
And we'll get to see Cetin, Necla.
If only you hadn't told him!
It could've been a surprise.
I didn't tell him.
It'll be a surprise for him too.
Necla, get that animal out of my face!
Don't call him 'animal', Edremit!
Huh, Lucky?
Come here, sweetheart. Come here.
Let's get some petrol here.
No, let's not, Edremit.
Look, my feet have swollen up!
There's something in those mushrooms.
Let's get out of here.
Wait, friends!
We'll take a ride on a swallow.
And if we're lucky, our wings
will melt in the sun like lcarus!
You're taking a ride on a swallow?
I won't let you.
From now on, you're staying with me.
Faruk Abi,
I was so out of order with you!
I'm taking care of you.
You're staying with me!
The same chord again. A hicaz.
It was bound to happen!
For goodness sake!
What's up this time, Edremit?
We're out of petrol, Necla Han?m!
I'll have to go and get some.
I told you, damn it!
I told you we were running low!
Am I supposed to stay here
all on my own?
What do you think?
You have Lucky. He'll protect you.
No! You're not going anywhere!
Besides, there are snakes here.
Necla, I'm at the end of my rope.
Get in the car!
No, I won't!
Doctor, are you still with us?
Huseyin Abi, their batteries are dead.
They took out the plug.
The oxygen wiped them out.
It's normal.
And you slow down.
Don't let's get wiped out for good.
Look, a car's coming.
Boss, looks like
they had a breakdown.
Let's see what they want.
Lucky. Lucky!
-Oh my God!
-I'm steering clear.
Hey, stop! Stop!
No! He's gone, he's gone!
God damn you!
What speed do you call that?
-Abi, when the mutt jumped out.
-Is he dead? Is he dead?
Abla, wait. I'll check him out.
I'm an animal guy, you know!
Oh, Lucky! Oh, Lucky!
Come here now.
-What are you doing?
-Helping his blood circulation!
This lot are drunk, Edremit!
Just listen to me!
Just hang on!
He's breathing! He's breathing!
What are you doing?
You'll drown the animal!
I'm giving him shock treatment.
Just keep out of this, lady!
Look, he's alive. He's alive!
Hey, are you alive?
He's come back to life.
Cutie boy, that's my cutie boy!
Aghh! God damn you!
Oh, Lucky!
-Just my damn luck!
-You pest!
Has he had his jabs?
Have you recovered?
-Yes, Abla. I'm fine.
-Here. Drink this.
See? I told you there was nothing
between her and the doctor.
Well, turns out you were right.
And I was barking up the wrong tree.
But I'm sick of this whole thing.
I've had it up to here, Firuzan Abla.
I'll go to her house tonight
and talk to Mujgan.
-To her house..
-Yes!
What about Karabacak Kadriye?
I've made my plan. I'll slip
round the back without waking Kadriye.
-No kidding!
-Yes.
Thieves! Help, neighbours!
Thieves!
Who is that? Who's out there?
Dad, put the gun down
for goodness sake!
-Dad?
-Who are you? What's going on there?
Who are you?
Is Hayri Abi around? Hayri Abi?
I came to see Hayri Abi!
When the dog growled like that
I got scared and fell in the well.
The house next door is Hayri's.
ldiot!
Lucky! Come here, Lucky!
Huseyin, is that you?
It's Recep, Abla. Recep the melon man.
I bring you melons, right?
So I got the wrong house.
Hayri Abi wanted melons, you see.
I've disturbed you
at this time of night.
I'll go off to Hayri Abi then.
Good night.
I'm sure I know
that guy from somewhere.
God!
Dad, it's me! What are you doing?
Huseyin? What is this, all painted
like a commando? You terrified me!
-I had an accident.
-What accident?
Come and sit down for a bit.
Over there.
-You're OK, aren't you, dad?
-Fine. Thanks.
You're not mad at me, I hope.
I never ask how you are these days.
You have any problems?
No. I potter about
with your grandfather.
Does granddad mess you around?
No, but he's a bit of a joker.
A law unto himself.
I just get on with it.
What's this accident business?
A sudden mishap. There's a rice field
behind Melek's house.
Huseyin!
-An affair of the heart, is it?
-Yes.
You had a ring set aside in Istanbul.
You mean that girl?
-Yes.
-Are you in love?
Head over heels!
Does your stomach hurt
when you think of her?
Everywhere hurts.
I'm all out of whack, dad.
It's like I'm going to throw up
whenever I think of her.
I can't believe
I'm doing this to myself.
-Well?
-Well, isn't it obvious? Look at me!
Look, son.
Always follow your passions in life.
Never regret anything.
I don't pity anyone
like I pity someone with regrets.
Don't have regrets!
Battle to the very end!
The beauty is in the battle.
Embrace what you love. Don't give up.
Everything beautiful is hard, dad.
Take the clarinet. That's beautiful.
But if you can't play, you can't play.
It drives you crazy.
I mean, it's hard.
-The saxophone's harder.
-No, not like the clarinet.
Then play if you think you can.
Sure, I'll play.
What's the big deal?
But we shouldn't go waking people
at this time of night.
-Are you challenging me?
-Don't say that. But well, yes!
Well, damn you!
Hey, come here, come here!
Oh my God!
-What's this, Huseyin?
-Duck shit.
The smell of duck shit sticks about
till 40 washes get it out.
Should we go to the hamam, Huseyin?
We can use a hose
somewhere over there.
Where are we going to find
a hamam open at this time?
Captain, who were these drunks
for goodness sake?
No idea. One was fat like this.
Said he's an animal man. Puts spells
on them I'd say. The fiend! Cocky too!
Good grief!
But that's not all!
Strange things happened last night.
A guy fell in the duck pond.
The whole household was out of bed!
-Who on earth was it?
-I don't know the man!
-Mujgan, don't you know him either?
-No, Cetin Amca.
An isolated incident.
Things like that don't happen here.
Whatever. We've only come
to see our daughter for a week.
We don't want the holiday spoiled.
Cetin, are you pleased with Mujgan?
No need to ask, captain!
She's the pride and joy of Geyikli.
Well done you!
-Dad, suppose I drop by on Sema?
-Of course, dear.
-Well, hello there!
-Hello!
-How you doing?
-Fine. You? Have a seat.
All right, I guess.
You take over as boss
and forget all about us, ?bo!
No, come on. Would I forget you?
I'll order tea. Have a tea.
-No. I'm not in the mood.
-Go on. Just a tea!
I'm really not in the mood.
What's up, lovesick cloud?
No luck with Mujgan?
Well, now I have her family to handle.
I'm about to lose it, I tell you.
Look. This is my second favour to you.
Don't you forget it!
What's that?
How you doing, wife?
-OK, fish man. How about you?
-Fine. Waiting for tonight.
Animal!
-Hello, Huseyin.
-Hello, Mujgan.
-How are you, Huseyin?
-I'm fine. You?
Same as ever. My parents are here.
I know.
It's been a long time.
-Well, you have a guest. You're busy.
-Guest?
The blonde singer, you know? Her.
-Oh, Firuzan Abla?
-Abla? But she's young!
Well..
Why are you looking at me like that?
-How?
-Suspiciously.
Like I've committed a crime
for goodness sake!
Was it me you came to see last night?
-Yes.
-If only you hadn't come via the well!
-Hey, don't laugh!
-I keep thinking of you like that!
What could I do? It was your dad.
How would I know?
I couldn't believe it was your dad.
The way Kadriye was screaming.
You'd think I'd stolen her ducks!
Thieves! Thieves, women!
Huseyin.
Remember that rose you brought me?
-Yes.
-My mum just loves it.
-I'll get one for her too.
-Go on then.
OK.
Why did you come last night?
Mujgan.. I umm..
I have something to tell you.
You see, with you, I...
-Oh no!
-What's up?
My dad!
Oh dear, oh dear!
-What are we going to do?
-What?
-What are we going to do?
-How do I know?
?rfan! Where are you, son?
What's the bream like?
I can't give you the bream, nurse.
Bream's no good for you. It stinks!
The gilt head's better. Line caught.
We catch them ourselves, nurse.
-Right.
-Mujgan?
-Ah! Dad?
-Huseyin, what's going on?
Mr Mayor, hello. Hello, Amca.
?bo went off to the toilet.
He left the shop to me.
I'm helping out.
And the nurse needs some fish.
This guy..
What are you doing here?
Buying fish, dad.
Cetin, he's the guy we met on our way!
The drunk animal man!
But today he's a fishmonger!
Who knows what his real trade is!
-Huseyin?
-Mr Mayor, the man's right.
There was an unfortunate accident
yesterday. We went up Mount lda.
The oxygen got to us.
These guys have a dog...
...and we ran into it in the car.
But the animal's fine. I treated it.
How was it last night? Better, huh?
I mean, the animal's fine now.
Yes.
Great! Too bad it happened.
How can we make it up to you?
First of all, let's welcome you
to the town with this.
-Here, nurse.
-What are you doing? Take it away.
-Huh?
-Take it away!
Captain, it must have been bad luck.
Huseyin's a good lad, you know.
Now, I expect you and Firuzan Han?m
and the band at the vineyard at 4.00.
Put things right for once and all.
We'll give the captain a fine welcome.
-Sure. Welcome!
-Hello there, Mr Mayor.
-Hello, ?rfan.
-Welcome! Welcome, Mujgan.
Huseyin, what the hell are you doing
with that fish?
Bravo, my lad!
You should do this full-time!
Cetin, you know,
I just love that song.
Tell me about it, captain! You had
the bandsman play it 20 times a day!
What days they were!
Firuzan Han?m,
you haven't had any goat.
Thanks, Mr Mayor.
But I've gained weight here.
How am I going to lose it again?
Heavens above, just gain weight!
Enjoy, enjoy!
Firuzan Han?m, Edremit Bey
was my captain in the army.
Hey, that's great.
You've kept in touch all this time.
He's our Mujgan's father too.
And Necla Han?m here is her mother.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sure I know you from somewhere,
but where?
The stage in Istanbul, I expect.
I doubt it.
Edremit doesn't have a nightlife.
Maybe Bal?kesir has one.
Just kidding!
Firuzan Han?m is the pride
of the Istanbul stage, you know.
-Thank you.
-Well, we've never been to Istanbul.
-We're from lzmir. So elsewhere maybe.
-You're from lzmir? So am I!
-Really? Whereabouts?
-Kar??yaka, 35.5 territory.
-And we're from Bostanl?.
-You're kidding!
-I'm serious!
-No, you're kidding!
I'm serious!
Wait, so you'll know whatsitsname..
Lokum Mustafa, sells Turkish delight.
-And Sait, the pastry man next door.
-Exactly, yes
-The apartment block on the corner!
-That's where she grew up.
Ah! That's just amazing, Mujgan!
Hey, Mujgan. Let's have your number.
-Sure.
-We can blab about lzmir now and then.
That would be great.
Give me the number then.
05, how does it go on?
OK.. I'm tapping that in.
Take a look, will you?
Yes, that's right.
Hey, baby. How am I supposed
to catch a fish without any bait?
That's a trotline.
When the feathers dance around...
...the fish are drawn by the sparkle
and swallow the hook.
Hmm.. So we're an expert.
Hook them with your sparkle, do you?
Not every fish.
I wonder..
The moves are rather experienced.
What was that?
Experience is a swordless soldier
in the face of love.
Crazy guy!
And we have an answer to everything.
Why do they call you Spaniard?
Let's hear that.
I'll tell you one day.
-Promise?
-Promise.
-Say it again.
-Promise.
Ah, what perfection!
I've fallen hook, line and sinker.
What?
I think I've caught something.
But I don't know what to do next.
Pull it in!
I can't. Help me.
I can't pull it in.
Maybe if you go that side..
Look at me.
Are you faking this?
What do you think?
You're so crazy!
Wait, we'll capsize!
-How you doing?
-Fine.
I wanted to talk about something
with you, so I said to Firuzan Abla...
-What did you do to me? Shall we walk?
-OK.
Huseyin. Remember you played
a song for me here?
'Fly Away, Birds'.
Right. I've learned the words.
No kidding! Go on then.
Let's hear.
No, you'll only make fun.
Why would I make fun
for goodness sake? Go on!
-Really?
-Yes!
OK.
Bravo! You had me all burning up.
We can go to work together, really.
-Yes, right!
-Yes, right!
-Ah!
-What's up?
Isn't that Firuzan Abla?
And Spaniard with her!
Well, aren't you a gentleman!
Which is mine? Wait, which one's mine?
This one, I think.
Abla, I'd rather go blind
than have seen that moment!
What's the problem?
I don't approve.
I won't allow this affair!
Good God!
Are you reading me the riot act?
Ungrateful so-and-so! It was fine
when I fixed a date with Mujgan.
Keep Mujgan out of this.
You had to go and pick
my best friend on strings!
What a joke! You're jealous.
That's it, you're jealous!
Why should I be jealous?
Hey, are you crazy?
Nothing's even happened yet.
I just took a shine to the guy.
I mean, there's nothing definite yet.
It's not like we're about
to start dating. You get me?
Actually, our Spaniard
beats that Fatih any day.
OK, I have one condition then.
I don't know the first thing about it.
If things get serious between you,
I'll pretend I've only just found out.
I'll go, ''Ah! Good luck to you!''
I have no patience for disrespect!
I'm leader of a band, you know!
I'm their boss.
OK, boss. I think that's clear!
You're just jealous!
I could eat you, my rustic loaf!
Here, I have to pinch your cheek!
Here, I have to pinch those cheeks!
-Hey, don't!
-Come here, my little jealous one!
Hey OK, Firuzan Abla. OK!
-Oh my God!
-What the hell is that?
-What is that?!
-Huseyin!
Granddad! Granddad!
Granddad, what the hell is this?
We got the champion, finally.
Cevahir. The camel of camels!
-How did you get him?
-With a bank loan.
With a bank loan?
Yep. Thanks to Ali R?za.
He tied up his pension for it.
Oh my God! Dad?
Let's get me a saxophone, son.
And take me along to those weddings.
It's good you told me, Kadriye Han?m.
And it was him
who fell in the well that night.
I recognized Huseyin all right,
but I couldn't work out from where.
The situation's absolutely clear.
Well, let's hope for the best.
They obviously love each other.
They were seen on the island today.
All over one another.
Shame on you!
This was bound to happen.
Leave a girl to her own devices and
she'll end up with a piper or drummer.
This one's chosen the piper!
Edremit!
I didn't educate you
to be a common musician's wife!
Dad!
But it was obvious
the guy was up to something.
The imbecile! Sneaky peasant!
But from tomorrow it's home work home!
You're not to see the guy!
Musician's wife, Mujgan!
Gambler's wife Mujgan! Mujgan, Mujgan!
You're completely out of your mind!
Take your dog and get out!
Out! You as well! You as well!
Come on, Lucky.
We're leaving daddy.
Get going!
No daughter of mine
is marrying a musician!
Shoo!
Did I surprise you?
Yes.
How come?
-I don't know. What are you doing here?
-What are you doing more to the point?
I brought a plant.
I supply the plants here.
Argh! You're a florist now, are you?
I know everything.
You're to keep away from my daughter!
You're not to see Mujgan!
How do you mean?
That's my last word, Huseyin.
But well, you should ask Mujgan
what she thinks too.
Look! I'm at the end of my rope.
Let's not wind each other up.
No daughter of mine is marrying
a musician. Forget Mujgan and move on!
Have a good day.
You see everything, don't you, mum?
He won't let his girl marry a musician.
The captain comes to give a good time,
ask for the girl and he's all slime.
What should I do now, mum? Huh?
Hello there, nurse.
Is the doctor around?
No. He won't be back today.
Can I help?
I have someone sick at home.
No, sweetie.
Her phone's still switched off.
Her dad's confiscated it.
Abla, please help!
I have to talk to Mujgan.
What can I do, Huseyin?
The guy will twig when he sees me.
You're right,
but what should we do then?
Wait. Let's sit somewhere
with a clear head and make a plan.
I'll get you out of this mess.
Don't worry, bum fluff.
Move! Get this thing going.
Go on!
Abla, look!
-Who the hell is that?
-How would I know?
-Follow him, bum fluff!
-Huh?
C'mon, get going! Follow the guy.
See where they're going.
If his injury's bad, we could
have called an ambulance actually.
Nurse, he's an old man.
We can't move him.
And he's stubborn like nothing else.
He insisted on having the doctor come.
Where's he going with her?
We're out of the village.
Abla, stop rolling around!
We have to stick together like flies!
OK. You just step on it.
We mustn't lose them.
Excuse me. If we're going any further
could I just use your phone?
I don't have a phone.
-No way!
-What's wrong?
This road goes to the old harbour.
So why are we going this way?
-What's there?
-Nothing.
No one, no villages.
There's nothing there.
If the man means well,
why's he coming this way?
God, bum fluff! Don't scare me.
Go on, follow him. Go on!
Step on it, bum fluff!
We've lost sight of them.
I'm going as fast as I can.
-Hey, what's that?
-God damn it!
What's going on? Are we on fire!
My God, we really are!
Off the bike, Abla! Save yourself!
We're on fire! Smoke's coming out
Hold the thing, Huseyin. OK.
-We'll catch fire too!
-God damn it! What's wrong with it?
God damn you stupid thing!
Screw your steering, axle, everything!
Excuse me, Abla.
What do you expect
if my granddad makes the bike?
What do you expect if you're driving
more to the point?
What do we do now?
So it's my fault now, huh?
Sling the mud then, see if it sticks.
You told me
to step on it, Firuzan Abla.
How fast can it go? You think it's a
Ferrari? There you go, I stepped on it.
We've lost the girl too.
Here we are stuck in the wilds.
Come on, let's pick up the bike
and lean it against that pine tree.
It's huge. Where am I supposed to hold it?
Grab the back.
Where is she? Where?
Think you're walking
into a bear garden, do you?
Where's Mujgan?
If you don't know, why would we?
My girl went missing three hours ago!
She's not at the clinic.
I've asked everyone. It just so happens
Huseyin is gone too. Where are they?
We don't know.
He's run off with my girl, hasn't he?
Now look, my patience is running out.
It's my patience that's running out!
There's no need for rudeness.
My son wouldn't do that!
Don't overstep the mark!
-Where are they then?
-Taking a walk.
Where are we going?
There's a shortcut through the trees.
I know. Just follow me. Come on.
How can I? I can't keep up.
Slow down!
Wait, stop!
Let's just think calmly.
Call the mayor.
Have him talk to the gendarmerie.
There's no signal!
It's a miracle you can speak
on that phone in the first place!
Hold on a second. God damn it!
There's no signal on this either.
-What are you doing?
-Looking for a signal.
OK.
Abla! I'm sinking! It's a swamp!
I'm sinking, Abla! Abla, help!
-Where did you fall in? What shall I do?
-Find a stick. Pull me out!
-Wait!
-Hurry!
-OK, found one! Pull!
-Hold it this way.
-Grab the thing!
-Pull!
I can't! You're too heavy.
I can't pull it.
-Pull!
-Just...
There, that's the end of us.
Give me your blessing, Abla.
I'll give you crap!
I'll give you poison!
-Why aren't we sinking?
-How do I know?
So the swamp's only this deep.
Let's get out then.
-Go on!
-Is it OK to walk? Wait. Hold on.
I guess it's not exactly a swamp.
Wait. Forget that. Wait!
Here! Grab hold of this.
You get out, then pull me.
His musician brat of a son
has run off with my daughter!
Don't be rude!
Use some manners when you speak!
-Exactly. Know your place!
-I'm feeling all faint.
Can we sue them for damages?
They marched into my garden
just like that! It's a disgrace!
Just a minute. Calm down! Hold it.
Don't panic! Calm down!
Don't panic! I guarantee they'll find the guys.
Really, they'll find them.
My grandson's gone!
He's gone, gone!
Don't say that!
You'll tempt fate, Hatice!
You were too hard on the girl.
Far too hard, Edremit.
Captain! Captain!
Edremit!
Wait! I'll get him some yoghurt.
The wound's infected.
It needs to be opened up.
Open it up then.
-But if a doctor was here..
-Open it up, I said!
I need hot water.
Some short cut!
I'm done in!
God, look at the state of me!
The phones have gone too.
God damn you, Thracian Shrek!
-What the hell's Shrek?
-How do I know?
I saw a poster somewhere.
Looked just like you.
-A star?
-Right. A star.
OK, I'm done in for real.
That's it. I can't go another step.
-Let's get to the main road.
-The main road?
-Where was the main road?
-Now that's north.
Yes.
-We're lost.
-Yes.
-Abla!
-What?
The evil eye is on us.
That's why all this is happening.
There's no evil eye, bum fluff.
It's you!
If they've done anything to Mujgan,
I swear...
-Agh!
-What's wrong?
-Ah, I'm dying for a pee!
-Just do it over there.
How? L ike it's that simple!
What if a hyena trots out?
-A hyena? We're not in Africa here!
-So you don't get hyenas?
No! If it makes you feel better,
I'll stand over you.
No! How ridiculous can you get!
-Huseyin, are you there?
-Go ahead, Abla. Do it. I'm here.
-Don't come too close.
-OK, Abla. Just do it.
Don't take all night!
Get on with it.
Firuzan Abla, are you OK?
Firuzan Abla? Firuzan Abla!
I'm coming over.
Firuzan Abla?
Firuzan Abla?
Firuzan Abla?
-Psss!
-Ah! What are you doing?
You coward, bum fluff!
What's got into you?
Is this the time for jokes?
We'll get eaten by jackals here
and you're still after a laugh!
But you just said
there are no hyenas or anything.
No hyenas, but there are jackals.
The smaller kind, like this.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Don't worry about jackals. They're OK.
Worry about pigs. They're the worst.
They have teeth the size of slippers!
If they get their teeth in,
your flesh rips apart like paper.
-Shut up, scaremonger!
-You asked!
You started it!
You ask what's around,
I tell you, and it's a crime!
Ooph, OK! All right, Shrek!
-Look, a snake!
-Agh!
What's it like then? What's it like?
God damn you!
I hope this road goes somewhere.
Now let's say Huseyin's run off
with your girl. OK?
OK!
Right. Well, where's Firuzan Han?m?
She's not around either.
So have the three run off together?
Playing hooky, are they?
Isn't it obvious?
She's gone to help.
Well? The woman's car is here.
Her things are here.
Did they leave in a hurry?
What kind of help is that?
Something must have happened!
Something's happened to Mujgan!
Necla! Just calm down, will you!
Halil Aga, where's the motorbike?
Exactly! Where's the motorbike?
Bravo! You've solved it!
All three sped away on the bike!
But would that bike
take the weight of all three?
Sure it would,
but how would they all fit on?
The engine's powerful enough.
I made it with my own hands, you know!
We're best off waiting at home.
Absolutely not! We should all
stick together at this difficult time.
Ali R?za Bey is right.
I'm not going anywhere.
Stay put, dear! Set that dog free.
Let the poor thing wander around.
Don't be shy! Make yourselves at home.
We count as family now!
Hey look! There's a house.
God! After walking all this way
we should've come out at the harbour.
Stuff that. I'm talking about a house!
There'll be a phone.
Abla, wait! Suppose it's them
who kidnapped Mujgan?
They can kidnap me too!
I've had it!
I can't hack your hyenas,
your pigs and whatever. Get going!
Kamuran! If you'd lived, we'd be celebrating
our 45th wedding anniversary tonight.
Only God exists in solitude!
No one should be alone, my Kamuran.
Is he praying?
Reading poetry, I think. Just shut it!
Stay out of this. I'm the boss now.
-...not even a hello from you.
-Hello!
Excuse me! Sorry!
Yes?
I wonder if you could help us?
We're in a terrible state here.
Come over. Come on.
That way. Come over.
OK, thanks.
You must have gone astray.
Yes, I suppose
we came the wrong way, huh?
The old harbour is this way.
The road in front of the house
goes up to the Ayranc?k turning.
Yes. And we've bothered you
at this time of night.
Sorry.
What a wonderful spread you prepared!
We're celebrating
our 45th wedding anniversary.
Amazing, amazing! That's so nice.
Don't get the wrong idea,
but your wife's clothes fit perfectly.
I guess we're the same shape.
I'm all warm again now.
Kamuran is slim like you.
Just like you.
We've started without your wife but..
You eat! Just eat!
Excuse me, where's the phone?
There is no phone. Just the radio.
Telephones bother me!
Really?
When do you think
your wife will come?
-She's always here!
-Where?
Beside you!
Beside me?
She sees us. She hears us.
I feel it.
Abla, they'll worry about us.
They'll be out looking.
Let's say goodbye and make a move.
We'll follow his directions, huh?
Sit! Where are you going
at this hour?
Well, can I get some water then?
I won't touch anything inside.
OK, I'll get you some.
Are you asleep?
-Why?
-The guy's off his head! Nuts!
Look, he lays a place
for people who aren't here.
He looks at you and goes off in another
world. He keeps contradicting himself.
He'll kill us!
Is that Kamuran?
Ah! Now we're in trouble.
She looks like you.
She really does.
Maybe he'd let me go, but you'd stay.
That's clear, Abla.
Come on, let's go! Leave all this.
You're still eating. C'mon, get up!
Have you had enough there?
Yes. Yes, really. Thanks.
It's time we got going.
Let's not bother you any longer.
No, if you're still hungry,
I'll give Necati the chop too.
-Who's Necati?
-The other chicken.
No, no need for Necati Bey
or any other chickens.
We should get going.
We've eaten enough anyway. Haven't we?
Too right. In fact,
I could throw up right here.
If you've had enough,
then wait a moment.
He's grabbed the tools.
He's on his way, Abla. Run!
Hold on! Wait!
Huseyin, over here!
Not that way, this way!
Where are you going there?
I still have watermelon to give you!
If only we could find water somewhere.
Abla, there's a house there, look!
You see that, Abla?
Isn't that the guy
outside the hospital?
Sure is. The minibus is there too.
Look. C'mon, run, Abla!
-Wait, the car's coming. Hide!
-Hide! Over there!
Come here!
If only we had a phone now.
Abla, let's go in.
How?f he kidnapped the girl,
he's sure to kill us!
But he doesn't know
we've come for Mujgan.
-C'mon, let's go in.
-But how?
-Troy!
-You mean build a horse?
Giddyup!
God damn you, bum fluff.
Is this what Troy's about?
Abla, don't spoil the game.
Leave it to me. I know what I'm doing.
This way! This way!
Anyone there? Anyone there?
Who are you? What do you want
at this time of morning?
Greetings, Abi.
We're looking for work.
We've come a long way. The wife and me,
we're both hungry and thirsty.
We'll do any work,
in the fields or whatever.
And my wife can do housework.
Can't you, Hediye?
Huh, yes. I can.
No, I don't need anyone.
Don't send us away, Abi!
We'll work just for food.
We'll chase the crows away
if you have them.
We won't waste any harvests.
My wife makes nice pancakes too.
-Don't you, Hediye?
-Yes, I do.
Lady, where are you from?
Where am I from?
Umm, Gulucuklu.
Gulucuk? Where's that?
Gulucuk? Right up on the hill
from Kazl?ca.
There's no work here.
Now get on your way.
Aga, do you have no pity?
No conscience?
You're sending us away?
But we're hungry and thirsty!
Is it my fault you're hungry?
Get going! F**k off! Go on!
-So much for Troy!
-It's your fault, Abla.
You say you're from Gulucuk.
It got the guy suspicious.
So how did you know
where Gulucuk is, huh?
You think I work in rural affairs?
Ungrateful idiot!
I've turned into a savage
all because of you!
Two weeks ago, Firuzan
was performing on red carpets!
Now she's chasing work
on the back of a donkey! Enough!
Abla, it's Mujgan!
-Abla, Mujgan, Mujg..
-Quiet!
-Mujga..
-Quiet!
They didn't let me marry you,
didn't let me
We were so in love
I'm running back home,
running away with my sweetheart
Skipper, the cargo's loaded.
Come over then. I'm waiting. OK.
Hey, mother-in-law,
what have you done to us?
We were so in love
I'm running back home,
running away with my sweetheart
Hey, what are you doing here?
Hey, mother-in-law,
what have you done to us?
Man, I'm talking to you!
What are you doing here?
What can I do?
Found a bottle there.
I'm downing it here, Abi.
You refused us food and water.
What can I do?
And the wife's gone back home.
I'm drowning my sorrows.
Watching the crows.
Look at the crows. Look, you see?
What do you want
from my girlfriend, huh?
Cut your throat, shall I? Huh?
C'mon then!
C'mon and cut me up! C'mon!
Here, let's drag him aside.
Grab hold of him!
Let's get him away from the road.
Grab him! Go on!
Pull, pull.
Pull him where?
Can't you push a bit?
Mujgan!
I'm here, Mujgan. I'm here!
Huseyin, Huseyin!
Untie my hands.
-Mujgan! Mujgan!
-Ah, Firuzan Abla!
Thank God! Bravo, bum fluff.
Untie her hands.
-You're OK, aren't you?
-Yes, fine!
Sweetheart!
Thank God! I'm free.
Oh my God!
-Who are they?
-Refugees!
What?
Huseyin!
Are we moving?
Yes.
Ah, perfect!
Loads of action, loads of fun,
loads of tourists all around. Huh?
That's what a holiday's about.
Right?
Hey, Abla. Are you OK?
No, I'm not! No! You damn idiot!
Don't hit me in front of the girl!
Shut up! I'm going to kill him!
He turns up, he's all lovey-dovey,
then he gives me nothing but grief.
I'm sick of it! Enough!
And stop staring, you lot!
Look, sorry. I raised my voice a bit.
Excuse me. I just got uptight.
Firuzan Abla,
they wouldn't understand.
I saw it on the news. They take
their money, then sink the boats.
-Are you serious?
-Yes.
Ah! Poor things!
What are we going to do?
Right, poor them,
but isn't it poor us too?
We're in the same boat here.
Ask where they're going.
Go on, ask!
What did he say?
We've won a Greek holiday, bum fluff.
And the priest's made
a fabulous pilaf with walnuts.
Anyway wait. I'll explain. Hold on.
Not 'killing'.
Thief. What's the word for thief?
Mujgan? Any chance of knowing
what you said to the man?
Sure, that's right. That's more umm..
Enough! Enough! He doesn't understand!
Look this way!
You know the captain up there?
He's going to drown us.
He's going to sink the boat, kill us.
He's pocketed the money.
So let's whack his head off.
C'mon, let's go!
Otherwise we're all dead!
C'mon, let's go!
What are you doing?
He's saying to help.
He's already smashed it by himself.
The guy's something else.
So?
Who's going to drive the boat?
Nice job, you two!
What? It's his fault. If I hadn't bashed
the guy, he'd have killed him.
I thought I'd knock him out.
What could I do?
If I'd asked you,
you'd have killed him.
Man, are you tough or what?
Out of there. Out!
Huseyin, it's motoring. Do something!
Abla, what do I know?
I'm a musician, not a helmsman.
What the hell is that?
We're going up to the surface.
Yes, sir.
It's stopped.
Sound test. This is a sound test.
Sound test.
Give it here.
Hello. Can anyone hear us? Hello.
No, you say 'over', not 'hello'.
I've done this before.
Over! Can anyone hear us, over?
Firuzan abla.. What the hell is that?
Oh dear, oh dear!
What's this boat doing
in the middle of the military exercise?
Congratulations, Huseyin.
You're the first fishing boat skipper...
...to take part in the Troy Exercise.
Frankly, that takes a lot of courage.
-Sir, I...
-You've made history!
Those illegal immigrants
have gone back home thanks to you.
And there's a good chance I'll become
sea captain in Ad?yaman. Bravo.
Is there any sea in Ad?yaman?
None! You don't find sea there.
Anyway. Thank goodness it's all over.
My daughter, my daughter! My sweet!
-What happened?
-Are you all right, sweetie?
Yes, of course.
Yes, Mr Governor. Of course.
Firuzan Han?m, I'm sorry
you had to go through this!
-Thank you, thanks.
-I was worried sick about you.
Thanks.
Captain, happy reunion!
How are you, my dear Mujgan?
I'm fine, Cetin Amca.
Huseyin and the others saved me.
It'll be even better from now on.
I've talked to your mother
and got the OK from her too.
We're going back to Izmir.
You'll continue your work in Izmir.
The Geyikli adventure is now over!
Thank you too, captain.
-You're welcome. It's my job, captain.
-Relax.
Come on. Come on!
What is it this time?
Coming with us, are you?
No. It's like I hijacked you,
but I have something to say to Mujgan.
Say it to me!
The girl's had enough upsets.
In that case, captain,
could you give this to Mujgan?
I know I'm troubling you, but..
Look, son.
I don't have a hard heart.
If you have children in future,
you'll understand me.
But you're not giving me
a chance to, captain.
I do understand you though.
You have dreams for her.
I'm not part of those dreams.
What can I do? This is all I am.
So if it's not going to happen,
it's not going to happen.
There we go.
Why not come with me, bum fluff?
The change will do you good.
Thanks, Abla. Maybe in winter.
I should spend some time with dad.
You're right there.
OK then.
Huseyin!
Give me a cigarette, Necla!
He's got me crying too, son of a bitch.
Mujgan Filiz,
daughter of Edremit and Necla Filiz...
...do you accept Huseyin Badem,
son of Ali R?za and Ay?e ?eker...
...as your wedded husband?
Yes!
Huseyin Badem,
son of Ali R?za and Ay?e Badem...
...do you accept Mujgan
as your wedded wife?
Yes!
-Are you people witnesses?
-Yes!
With the power vested in me by the law
I pronounce you husband and wife!
Ow! Hey, what are you doing?
Knock it off, Huseyin! That's the custom.
Go on, kiss the bride! Lift her veil!
May God make you happy!
Hey, groom. Look!
He's asking us up there.
C'mon, let's go.
-I'm crazy for you.
-So am I for you.
-Are we married now?
-Yes!
Firuzan Abla! How did I forget!
What's up this time?
-Wait. This is for you.
-What's this?
Abla, there's a song on here.
It's famous round here.
I did a new arrangement.
Take it. Sing it on your album.
It can remind you of me.
They'll like it.
What are you talking about, bum fluff?
Thanks very much.
Come here, local yokel!
Let me give you a hug.
Oh dear, oh dear.
Huseyin!
Play, Ali R?za, play!
Never mind the rain!
Come on! We're not here to sit down!
Our grandson's getting married!
On your feet, c'mon!
Six months later
Yes, she's on her way, guys!
She won everyone's heart
with her latest album.
She's a pop star!
She's totally beautiful!
She's a, she's a... Words won't do it.
An extraordinary woman is on her way!
Let's hear it now! She's a bean!
She's Firuzan!
Mujgan, she's on! Come quick!
Thanks. Thank you so much.
Yes, the guys have been going crazy
to see you.
It's your first time on the show, huh?
Yes!
-Let's talk about the album right away.
-Sure.
You spent years singing
all types of music in bars.
Yes, that's right.
Bless them, my fans never let me down.
Now, with this album
I developed a brand new style.
Of course,
for this new style of music...
...there's someone
I want to say a big thank you to.
Thanks. If you're saying thank you...
-The thank you camera?
-That's our thank you camera there.
The wide-angle one.
You say thank you to that.
Yes, they told me backstage.
Yes. Now I know
he's watching me tonight.
My dear friend,
one of Canakkale's greatest musicians...
...Huseyin Badem, I love you to bits.
And I send you kisses from here.
-Is he watching now?
-Yes.
Just look at Firuzan Abla.
I twittered all my fans today.
And I sent him a separate message.
I know everyone's watching tonight.
But I'm sure Huseyin
and his wife Mujgan Badem...
...are especially excited to be watching.
Thank you so much, Huseyin,
for this beautiful arrangement.
Many thanks to Huseyin Badem,
Mujgan and the whole of Canakkale.
Thanks. Are we ready to roll?
Yes.
Let's hear it then, guys!
For the first time live on Beyaz Show...
...Bean and Firuzan. Take it away!
-Hey, fix me a raki, wife.
-How much will you give me?
I'll give you my life!
