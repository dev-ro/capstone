Listen up, asshole.
I'm taking you in right now.
Have I ever arrested the wrong person?
I'll leave the answer to the judge.
My philosophy is ...
The good guys catch the bad guys.
Before the 1997 Hong Kong Handover
4 fives! 4 fives!
- That doesn't count!
Here, have some more!
7 sixes!
Do you know how to play?
Waiter, give her the rule book!
Let me introduce you to my younger brother, Tiger.
-Hello, Brother Shan.
Hello.
Your hands are wet.
That's my big brother... Zha.
I have a lot of stuff to move.  There are other smugglers who can do it.
Why should I have you ...
- If you want to do Vietnam,
It has to be us three.
Who would know the place better than us?
We're Vietnamese!
However you want to split it, we'll go along with it.
That's all there is to it!
That didn't count!  Again, again!
4 ones, I win!
- 4 ones?
That's not right!
Well it's right because I said so!
Police! We're checking ID!
You.  Come here.
I threw that bottle.
So what?
My apologies.
I'm sorry! I'm so, so, sorry!
January 2nd, 1997.
Club Mongkok, while checking ID,
you assaulted a patron,
and broke his pelvis in 3 places.
He spent 2 months in the hospital.
How do you plead?
February 17th, 1997.
During a Triad investigation,
you assaulted another person,
The criminal sustained serious head injuries.
According to the doctor, he has permanently lost his sense of taste.
How do you plead?
March ...
- That’s enough.
I'm guilty.
In the first half of this year,
on average you have been involved in 14 cases each month.
In each case, you've injured, on average, 3 people.
Half a year!  You've already broken your record from last year!
What's the problem with police apprehending criminals?
That's what I do!
Are you going to let us do our jobs, or what?
Inspector Jun, I know that you are an outstanding officer.
You have the highest number of solved cases on record.
But I want to remind you ...
You need to pay attention to your attitude and your methods.
I don't see the problem.
OK, you're free to leave.
You know something?
Since I came in, you've talked for an hour straight.
Who knows?  In that hour, I could have solved a case!
You need to reconsider your operating standards,
and stop wasting everyone's time.
Nice!
That's 50 thousand!  You still want to bet?
Don't bet against me, you'll lose everything!
Tiger ... that's not how you play golf!
It's not martial arts, forget your stances.
Here, I'll teach you.
It’s simple.  Hold the club like this.
Make sure your thighs and shoulders are level.
Look where you're aiming, then look at the ball.
Then swing through hard!
That was a bad demonstration.
Next time, next time, eh?
Boss. We've got a problem.
Hold on.
These guys don't know anything.
Go ahead.
I asked you to move the stuff to Vietnam.
It’s been 2 months!
Don't give me bullshit!  Where's my cargo?!
Are you trying to fuck me over?!
- Look ...
The ship's stuck in a storm!
So stop blaming us!
It'll be your problem if the ship sinks.
That shipment is worth 80 million!
You've only covered 2 thousand!
You should have told me earlier, I would have sent it by courier!
It’s just a few days by plane.
If you're shipping it by sea, of course it will take a few months!
Go home and wait.
What did you say?
Don't be stupid now.
Otherwise, I'll kill you.
You don't scare me!  Who the hell are you?
I come looking for Tony, and instead I find you morons!
Get Tony over here!
Motherfucker!
This is how we work!
Don't do that in public!
Put on some suntan lotion!
Come on, now!  Are you still pissed?
Calm down! You two are always arguing!
Inspector!
Stop trying to be cool all the time!
Why don't you just arrest people?
You're always beating people up!  We know you can fight!
Every time you come looking for me, you want me to save you!
And if something bad happens, you blame it on me!
What are you whining about, muscle man?
You're the one that hurt me!
Last time you injured my arm, the doctor said that there would be complications!
You threw wine in my face!
If I didn't do something, everyone would be suspicious!
You're the one that fought back!
Of course I fought back!
I can't lose my street cred!
Street cred? You're a cop!
Yeah, why don't you say it louder, idiot!
Look, you shouldn't have been so heavy handed.
And you know he's a loose cannon, and you still lit a fire under him!
When you got me into this shit, you made it sound good!
Now my life's in danger!
How long do I need to stay undercover?
We're not talking about that.  Let's talk about the facts.
Who is your superior here?
Oh, not this shit again.
What? You need to start following orders.
Stop arguing!  The two of you will probably never work together again anyway.
What?  Are you serious?
The complaint report is out.
You'll keep your position, but next month you're off the case.
What?  There's no need for that!
You said it yourself.  Both of you need to follow orders.
That's bullshit.
Keep going.  Watch your ass.
Same to you.
Do what you need to do.  But be careful.
If I die, then I die!  I'm going in!
You're playing it wrong again!
Wrong over and over!
Where was I wrong?
After the 6th note, the E flat!
I didn't hear anything wrong, except for you shouting!
You guys need to take this seriously!
You think we're just fucking around?  Then leave!
Not everyone does things your way, Inspector Jun!
You ..
- You must have been wrong.
If an officer makes a mistake,
they will ruin someone else’s life, as well as their own.
Take it seriously, and improve your work.
What are you doing here, mom?
I knew you were here, and wanted to let you know ..
I'm going back to the country.
Wait until I'm done, I'll take you myself.
I've already waited.
Waited until Auntie Chang died.
I'm going back to pay my respects.
If I like it there, I'm staying there.
Come on, mom.
I'm lonely here by myself.
You work all day, and have no time for me.
Son, don't abandon your life for your job.
What should be important to you is your life.
Without your life, how can you be someone?
Take care.  I'm leaving now.
So let me get this straight.
You stole Shan's shipment.
He wanted to negotiate, and you turned it to a fight.
And now you ask us to ignore it.  Why?
Look, we'll take care of Shan ourselves.
It would be bad if they found out you're involved.
Just ignore the whole thing, and nothing will happen.
We don't want to be involved in this shit.
You need to remember where you came from.
If we didn't take you in, you'd still be floating in the sea.
Our family was stuck in a refugee camp.
It wasn't much different than living in prison.
Why did we fight?
Because we wanted a place of our own.
If people ever got in our way,
then we went to war.
Brother.
So, how'd it go?
Did it go bad?
No, nothing yet.
The talks haven't even started yet.
Don't do anything for now, otherwise there'd be nothing to discuss.
Don't be unreasonable now.
That's it.  I'm gonna do it.
Wait, wait ...
How about you talk to them?
Four eyes, your wife takes your kid to school pretty early.
What if something bad happened to them?
Are you threatening me?
Of course I'm threatening you, motherfucker!
I don't want to hurt anyone’s feelings.
If we can work this out,
there will be many more opportunities for us in the future.
Hey, see that sexy woman in red ...
walking with her four-eyed kid?
When I tell you to, I want you to run them over!
OK.
So, have you thought it over?
Your family is about to reach the entrance.
I'm not getting an answer!
We'll ignore the situation with Shan.
Speak up.  I don't think he heard you.
We'll ignore the situation with Shan!
Don't do anything stupid!
Zha, it's Da Xia.
Let's go out for drinks! We're all friends here!
You should have said that from the start!
Have some breakfast.
I bought it for you guys.  Don't be unreasonable now.
Run them over.
OK.
Turn!
Are you a dog?  So obedient!
Just because I told you to, you'd do it?
You could have killed them!
Hey, I'll treat you out for your birthday tonight.
I'm going to meet with some friends.
What? You have friends?
Yeah.
-Alright.
Here, have fun.
Thank you, Boss.
Lily?
It's me.  Are you free?  Come over!
What'd you say?
What are you yelling at me for?
May!  Let me talk to your daughter!
What?  She's dead?!
- I'm so sorry ...
- Bobby?  It's Wilson.
What's up?  It's my birthday today!
Come on, let's not talk about that shit!
I just wanted to know if you wanna hang out or something...
Hello? Hello? ... Hello?
Hi, is Julie there?
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Are you done with work?
Not yet.  I'll come over afterwards.
OK, bye bye.
Bye bye.
It’s been a while.
It hasn't been that long.  We met half a year ago.
Have you been to Vietnam recently?
If you're going, you should be careful.
You might get caught.
Even if I'm just going there for a bowl of noodles?
I thought you were gonna quit your job at the bar?
I do want to quit,
but what else can I do?
Unless ...
You want me to be a prostitute?
Don't do that.  Do something respectable.
You're a pretty girl, you know.
Why don't you go into modeling?
You really think so?
Well, of course!
I think with your good looks,
you'd be able to land a good gig somewhere!
And what about you?
No way, I'm not photogenic at all!
The only ads I'd be able to do would be for Johnnie Walker!
I'm gonna take a shower.  Join me.
Tiger, are you really going to do this?
This isn't like you.
So where you want to go later?
I want to go on a picnic!
-OK.
Get out of here!
- Cops!  Get in!
You're lucky!
You can leave hospital at anytime.
If you keep fighting, I won't let it go so easily!
If you want to die, don't get me involved!
I want to testify.
Come in.
Inspector Wong, we've bought in the criminal.
That hurt, Inspector Wong.
Do you have something to drink?  It’s hot.
Shan's spilled the beans about Tony!
That’s great!  Let's go arrest him then!
We're assembling the task force right now.
You need to be careful, or you'd be first to die!
I know, I'm more scared than you are!
Inspector, please don't tell me you're leading the team on this one.
Relax, I'm not the one
that's been keeping tabs on those Vietnamese kids.
Get them to bring back Jun!
This is a time when the department needs him the most!
It's you who needs him the most, right?
Yeah.
Inspector.
Shut the door!
What are you doing?
Do you want me to get caught?
OK, what am I being brought in for?
Come on, why else would we call you back?
Help us solve this case,
so we can all take a vacation, OK?
Yes, sir!
Here, put this on your head.
Put it on!
Let me finish my smoke!
- No, put it out!
Your breath smells enough like shit already!
Put it on, fucker!
This is for your own good!
Inspector Wong, he's not co-operating!
Take him out for a beating, then.
Hong Kong's about to be handed over,
can't you guys take things a little more seriously?
It’s their mother's big birthday tonight.
Those three will definitely be there.
We'll take care of their associates first.
Sir, we're going to have to take you to the station.
OK.
Brother Wilson.
- Hello.
Brother Wilson.
- Hello, hello.
Eat, have some!
Doesn't it smell good? Try it!
- Auntie!
I wish you riches, health, happiness,
and that you stay beautiful forever!
Oh, thank you ...
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!
How's your appetite?
Stop talking to her, she’s not eating!
Leave now!
Auntie, enjoy your meal!
If they're not returning calls, then keep calling!
What time is it?!
No one's here!
- Please calm down, sir.
- Don't tell me to calm down!
Here, have a bite.
Tiger!
Come here!
You're so loud that mothers' not eating any more!
Kneel!
Apologize to mother!
Mother, please eat some!
So, everyone's here.
If no one goes to see Zha,
who will be there to celebrate their mother's birthday?
Have a mouthful.
Eat, ma!
If you don't want this, then what do you want?
You don't like it?
We'll order something else, OK?  Sea cucumber?
Abalone?  You don't like it?
Then I'll order Bird's Nest Soup for you!
Shark Fin?
Big Brother, something's wrong.
What's more important than mother not eating?
Eat, ma!
Tiger, feed mother.
Time to work ...
Stay here tonight.
Someone will take care of you.
You must catch them, Inspector Jun.
Here.
Have a mouthful.
The food here doesn't suit you.
I'll take you somewhere else, OK?
- Tiger.
- Where?
Don't worry, let's go!
Wilson! Come here!
Coming.
Hurry up!
Hey, manager!
Did you drive today?
Where is your car parked?
Hello?
Tony, go and get the money.
I'll leave with mother first.  We'll meet at the docks.
Understood.
Where to, Tony?
To the garage.
Brother, what’s happening?
Have you seen these people?  What time was this?
- Inspector Jun.
- What's the situation?
Someone's injured, an ambulance is on the way.
Xiao Ying.
-Yes.
Check his vehicle registration.
Xiao Ya, get this cleaned up.
-Yes, sir.
Hello?
Where are you? I'm outside your front door.
I’m busy.  I'll call you back later.
I can wait here until you come back.
Not tonight.
I made a spare key for you.
I'll give it to you next time.
Hey! Can you not talk on the phone!
Sorry.
Da Pao, the target vehicle is a dark green Mazda MPV.
License, JL2933
Also, a burgundy Acura Legend.
License, DE3654.
Hey, give us a hand!
Brother Tiger, did you lock the door?
Aw, shit.
I'll check it, take this.
They're leaving with the money, call you later.
We can go now, Brother Tony.
- Is it locked?
- Of course.
Sit in the back.
No problem.
That's the car!
Wilson, give me your phone.
Brother Tony.
Mother, sit tight.
Don't drive so fast!
Pull over!  This is the police!
I said, pull over!
Mother, sit tight!
Jia Hui, we're in pursuit!
Are you alright?  Hang in there!
I want to vomit.
- Vomit in here.
You'll feel better after you throw up.
It's alright.
We're heading through the industrial district!
Get out!
His body will be at the docks.
Hey, look over there!
Hey, man.  Are you alright?
- How's Wilson?
- Inspector Wong.
Don't know yet, they're still working on him.
They'll fix him up.  Stay calm.
Hey, what are you doing?
You bastard cops!
What are you doing?
What's it to you?!
Are you Julie?
I can arrest you for assaulting an officer!
So what if you're a cop?
Wilson is my partner!
He's undercover.
What are you in for?  Triad activity?
I'm not a Triad member.
No? Then join me!
Call me Brother Zha.
Do it!
Brother... Zha.
Have you ever seen your sons assaulting people?
I have three sons?
I've never seen them.
Sir, can you call the police for me?
Sir, call the police for me.
My sons are missing.
No one will come to see her on holidays.
Perhaps, never at any other time either.
Take care of her for me.  Her mind tends to wander.
It's my birthday!  I'm 80!  You should have come earlier!
I'm 80...
Xian Wei Zha, there is sufficient evidence that shows,
that during the period from 1992 to 1997,
you were involved in multiple accounts of
assault, smuggling, and Triad activity.
Those are the charges.  How do you plead?
Not guilty.
Hearing is set for May this year.
I'm transferring the case to the North Kowloon courts.
Use this time to gather your reasons.
You are denied bail and permission to leave the country.
All your assets are now frozen,
until the sentence has passed.
Wow!  You're putting all this on me?
You think you can convict me?
Let's go.
Hey, take your hands off me!
I'll sue you for sexual assault!
Move it.
3 months later
I won't be able to keep up with you soon.
Then I'll slow down to wait for you.
Take it easy.  You'll get used to it.
Oh, I don't know.
I lost the use of a leg,
you think I'll get used to that?
Everything's been sorted out for you.
Next week, you'll be transferred to a desk job.
Desk job?
Why don't you get the government
to give me some compensation?
Not only won't they pay,
but I have to cough up my own legal fees!
Everything's sorted?
Are you kidding me?
You know I've done everything for the force!
What have I gotten out of it?
Instead, I end up being a fucking gimp.
The people at the station are waiting for
your return, so hang in there.
I am hanging on!
And how many people are waiting for me?
Just you?
I forgot something,
don't wait for me.
Careful ...
Brother, Tiger and I will return before your trial.
I won’t give Wilson or Shan the opportunity to testify.
Tiger.
Mother.
My sons.
I'll take you home.
Mother, do you remember this place?
We used to live here.
After I pickup Big Brother,
we can leave Hong Kong.
Here.
What are you smiling about?
Nothing.  Maybe injuring your leg was a good thing.
That way you can't run around every day.
And you can stay home and keep me company.
You've taken care of me for so long.
You must like me a lot.
Don't you know that in every woman
is a natural sense to care for others?
On behalf of your inherited ability,
I hope that it will be like this forever.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
They're here!
Let me get changed!
- Careful!
-  Come on, come on.
- Hello.
- Hello!
Delivery!
Be careful.
Come and have a look!  It's good stuff.
Is it that good?
It's heavier than him!
Why do you live on the roof?
I'm so tired!
We only helped carry it.
Jun, he bought it and delivered it.
Where do you want it?
Over there.
OK.
Move over!
Put some muscle into it!
Careful, don't scratch it!
That cost over 30 thousand.  He paid for it himself.
That's sincerity.  Accept it.
Do you have a power strip?
- Yeah.
Here, let me do that.  You guys are so useless.
Where's the power strip?
I know you're no good with English,
so it's in Chinese.
Like driving, it's automatic.
Try using this button.
You always said that your leg hurt.
This will help improve the circulation to your leg.
The blood moves freely to the leg,
but the leg itself can't.
It should be easy for you.
Train your right leg to be as flexible as your
left leg, and you'll be fine.
What did you say?
I'm kidding!
So it wasn't that funny.
Forget it.
I'll get it.
Take out.
That smells good!
What is it?
Something good.
You know, there's a lot of pressure being a cop.
Then why don't you think about
doing something else?
Whatever you do, I'll join you.
Come over and eat.
Wow, all this looks good!  Let's eat!
Wait, let's take a picture first!
OK, take a picture as we eat!
No, the picture first!
This is my only request.
Like this.
A picture with the chicken?
Whatever, just go with it!
Come!
The chicken's a bit cold.
Wait!
Let's heat it up!
If we don't improve our standards,
how can we become better people?
It doesn't matter, we can still eat it!
It’s so easy to heat it up!
Chicken, 200 degrees.
I'll go help Inspector Wong.
Is Julie alright?
She's under observation.
Are you alright?
I'm filling in for Inspector Wong.
For security reasons, you are all placed on leave.
They killed the Inspector.  And witnesses.
And you want us to take a break?
I'm worried for your safety.
We're all risking our lives!
You take charge, and you put us on leave?
You're confused and emotional right now,
please leave.
When I was undercover,
I was living under the cover of fear every day.
They fuck up my leg,
then they blow up my home!
Now you want me to leave?
Obviously, you don't deserve to wear that uniform!
If there is sufficient evidence,
I will arrest the people involved.
Do you have any evidence?
Report to Madam for
what else needs to be done.
Tony.  Where's Tony?
Enough!  You're gonna kill him!
Give me your gun.
Give me your gun!
Give me your gun!
Give me your gun!
Give me your gun!
Come on, man!  He doesn't know shit!
Madam, what do we do now?
The most important thing
is to find out what happened to Tony.
The most important thing
is to protect Wilson in the hospital.
He's our only witness left.
Xiao Ying, let's go.
Let's go.
Why are you still writing?
My mother has a place in the country.
Song Flower River.
The country?
Let's leave together.
We'll start a family.
Are you sick of this place?
Though, after living in Hong Kong for so long,
I've never felt that this place was home.
My mother wants us to visit her.
All three of us.
I'm two months pregnant.
Are you worried?
Everyone entering the hospital must be searched.
All the exits, doors, stairs, toilets,
must be under watch.  Understood?
Yes, sir!
Nothing happens to Wilson before he testifies.
Hey, the baby's hungry.
Should we give it something to eat?
I'll go buy you something.
Don't go anywhere.
Inspector Jun, wait.
Wilson, Inspector Jun told you not to go anywhere.
Thanks.
Police!  Move!  Move!
Shots fired inside the elevator!
Get backup!  Quickly!
Hello?
I have her.
OK, OK, OK!  What do you want?!
Are you scared?
Yes, yes!
Whatever you want, just say it!  I'll do anything!
Watch out!  Stupid ass!
Move!
Mommy!
Drop the gun!
Put the child down!
I said drop the gun!
Are you deaf?
Put the child down!
Do you want her to die?!
Inspector Jun, what's the situation?
Inspector Jun!
It’s time to go to court.
Hello?
Wilson, where are you?
I'm heading off to court.
Did something happen to Julie?
Yeah.
Don't believe them!  They'll never let her go!
I have no choice.
How can you not have a choice?
You're helping those bastards!
I don't want anything to happen to her.
I don't want anything to happen to both of you!
Do you want to die with her?
Hello?!
You need to record a statement.
You beat the criminal to death!
Then arrest me.
Witness.  You may now testify.
I don't remember anything.
Due to sustained injuries,
the witness is unable to testify due to amnesia.
All charges against the accused ...
are dropped due to lack of evidence.
Tony.
I'm out.
Speak!  Where are you?!
South Shengwei.
Come quickly.  I'll be waiting.
Stop it!  Don't hit him!
Stop hitting him!
Wilson!
Wilson!
I knew I wasn't going to leave.
I just want you to let her go.
Wilson!
Shoot! Shoot him, Tony!
Come on! You scared?
Drop the gun!
- Drop the gun!
- On your mom's dead body!
- Fucker!
- Shoot him now!
Don't talk about my mother!
Brother!
I'm going to kill you bastard!
Fuck!
I'll drive.
Open the door!
What are you thinking?  Open the door!
What are you doing?
Leave with me!  Don't go back!
Leave with me!  You promised you wouldn't go!
Ma Jun, come out and fight!
Fuck you!
Ammo!
Let's go!
Have I ever arrested the wrong person?
I'll leave the answer to the judge.
My philosophy is ...
The good guys catch the bad guys.
