Looks lovely, darling. How about

I can't stop now.
Brian babe, you've been working all day.
You got to eat something.

What? It's fashion, man. Swagger, innit?
Whatever. Did you speak
to Russell about that advance?
- I need that money for tomorrow.
- Nah, I left, innit?
You done what?
I left, innit? I'm on bigger tings

Bigger tings? Bloody bigger tings?
I was relying on that!
- How could you do that?
- Ah, allow it, Mum man.
No, I won't bloody allow it,
you flipping moron!
- I'm not a moron, all right?
- Is that you, Kenneth?
Come and have a look
at my Supermarine Spitfire.
I don't wanna see
your wasteman plane, Dad.
Don't you dare speak
to your dad like that.
You're the only waste round here.
Waste of bloody space,
that's what you are.
I mean, look at you.
You could never be like your dad.
Your dad was suave, he had style.
Slot you right in there, just like that.
He had his pick of the women.
I'll tell you.
Your dad was a true player in his day.
You? Wasteman. I mean, when was
the last time you had a girlfriend?
When have you ever
brought a girl round here?
Have you even lost your virginity,
Kenneth? No, I don't think so.
Oh, I mean your dad really knew
how to turn a woman on.
There was this one night
we were on the kitchen table.
- Ah, allow it, Mum man!
- He knew how to put his back into it.
I don't want to hear this, Mum, all right?
- Perfect.
- Yeah, I loved your dad!
You've got no drive, that's your problem.
But I'll tell you something.
You can't just live here for free.
Life ain't like that.
You don't just get things
handed to you.
- How can you just walk out on your job?
- Russell's coming to man on a hype!
Idiot! We're skint. What am I supposed
to do now? They'll be here tomorrow.
Know how much we owe them bailiffs?
- Well, it's not my fault, is it?
- No? Where's my bloody rent money?
You ain't given me shit
for the last three months!
- You're a moron.
- I told you I'm not a moron.
What is this, Mum man?
Why you always picking on me for?
You got something against me
or something?
You don't talk to Lily like this. You don't
ask Lily for no rent. It's not right, man.
Lily is seven, you pathetic waste
of space! I tell you something!
You go back and see Russell, and you
beg for your job back for all I care!
Mum, you're mental.
Russell's an idiot, man.
There's no way I'm going back there.
Bun that.
Oh, you will, Kenneth, you will!

It's the most beautiful day.
And did you know, Edward,
this postcode was voted most
outstanding and up-and-coming area
by "Time Out" in the summer?
What about that, hm?
The Goonbred Estate.
- I think it adds character...
- No, Patricia, it does not add character.
A 13-year-old girl
came up to me last week
and addressed me as "Oi, My Size".
- Hm? "Oi My Size", Patricia.
- What is wrong with you, Edward?
I know you're not happy about it
but you'll just have to live with it.
- He is family.
- Oh, balls, he's family, Patricia!
But last summer it was all right to spend
our whole summer holidays with them.
Yes, because I didn't realise
we'd be asked to take in his damn
silly fool of a son for four months.
I don't like him.
I can't understand a word he says.
He's here!
First of all, I would
just like to say that my family and I
are very grateful to you
for letting me to stay in your house.
- Oh, it's nothing.
- I am very much looking forward
to being inside of your family.
Patricia.
I have to say that...
that you are looking even more beautiful
than the last time we were together.
Your hair looks wonderful, it's like a...
it's like a waterfall that cascades
on to your shoulders.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Well, I hope you're happy, Patricia.
I have a migraine. We have no pills.
- Get your own bloody pills.
- Under no circumstances!
- You go and get my pills!
- Please, sir! I will do this for you.
- I will go now.
- Oh.
I don't believe this.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
Edward, what...
Most up-and-coming area of London?
What's the worst
that could happen, Patricia?
How you mean,
you run out of Fruitellas, man?
Look, there is no more
bloody Fruitellas! No more, man!
But there's hundreds of sweets here!
Kitty Kat, Twix, Mars Bar, Snickers.
- Why you want bloody Fruitellas?
- Because I like them, innit?
Why you asking me for, blud?
It's a badman sweet! You get me?

then maybe you could give me a call
and maybe I could go through
some interview techniques with you.
You know, give you a hand.
Interview techniques?
You make me laugh.
Well, then, K, I guess
I'd better take your number, then.
Yeah?
Yeah, why not?
You seem like a nice guy.
I am nice, twice as nice,
nice with a lickle bit of spice.
Sorry?
Nah, I'm just saying, innit?
I do music, innit? I do this.
See them man over there?
They're my boys and all, yeah.
But trust me when I tell you none of
them know how to satisfy a girl like me.
You get me? To be honest, I don't really
like bragging about it. You get me?
- Right.
- But all of them man over there?
Two minute, man. And I'm talking
two minutes. You get me?
Me, on the other hand,
swagger's on point,
I go all night, and I'm talking all night,
like at least an hour.
Now, I'm a player
when it comes to the tings.
I'm thinking maybe me and you can
link up and do a little ting, get me?
You could come over to mine and we
can go over some interview techniques.
Cos I got techniques.
I got techniques like twelve tens.
I'm just gonna grind, man,
an hour of pure sensation.
Yeah.
Cos I do this, innit? Hm, it's nothing,
boy. It feels so nice, innit?
- What's he doing, blud?
- Who knows, blud?
I know you like that, innit?
It feels so good. It feels so warm.
Slow it down, slow it down.
Take time, think about the sheep.
You can do it, K.
You can do it. That's the one. Hm.
- Oh, yeah, slow it down.
- Wow.
Oh, my days, blud!
What the fuck are you doing, man?
- Tyrone.
- You trying to fuck that bollard, blud?
Nah, nah, it's just an itch, innit?
- Man's trying to fuck the bollard, blud.
- Nah, man.
You trying to sex that ting, blud?
Cos same man's already pressed that?
- Yeah?
- Yeah! You can't draw girls, blud.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha! Jackanory time!
- Oh, come on, man.
- You went there, blud.
- Shit.
- He is a friend of yours?
- Nah, that guy ain't no friend of mine.
That guy's just pure mean, blud,
just pure mean.
Enrique, maybe you should head back.
I'll get K to give you a call later.
Yeah, run along, Spanish boy.
It's fine. I can stay out
for a few more hours.
All right, cool. Wait here, though.
Boy, if you men don't mind, yeah,
I don't need this today, man.
I'm going yard.
Four, three, two, one. I'm going.
Just kotch, TJ, man.
What's wrong with you, man?
Why do you always do this?
It's cool, man. You're with me, innit?
I'm a topboy out here. Top of the top.
Me and Tyrone are cool.
He ain't gonna do nothing to you
if you're with me, man.
Come, man. I ain't Kenneth out here,
you know, blud? Shit.
Cos you know it's time!
My time!
- What possessions you got for man?
- Blud, on a level, I ain't got nothing.
Tyrone, cool?
I don't know who you are, blud,
but I will break your head.
I will confiscate your life, rudeboy.
You better get out of my proximity
at least two metre radius apart.
Furthermore, who are you
to be calling out man's name?
Do you know man to be calling out
man's name? Apologise, blud.
- Come on, Tyrone.
- I said apologise, blud!
- Just apologise, man.
- Sorry.
That's what I'm talking about. Everyone
needs to know their role out here.
Next time I'll slap that dry roasted
peanut head of yours. Ha-ha!
Who's on the throne?
Can't hear you, man.
- I said who's on the throne?
- Tyrone.
Yes, man! That's what I'm saying.
Big Mike ain't got nothing on me.
- What you saying, TJ?
- Safe, Tyrone.
- What creps are they, blud?

I can't believe Kenneth thinks
he can get girls, though, blud.
- I was just chatting to her, innit?
- You man are all batty boys!
You can't draw girls, blud!
I get girls, blud.
Touch that, blud. I'll allow you, innit?
- Kinda hench still.
- That's right, blud, hench!
You man could never be bigger
than me. You man are inferior to me.
If I think about it, I should slap you lot
up for even trying to dial up with man!
Ha-ha-ha. Ha!
What does that say, blud?
- Squinty eyes! What does that say?
- Link number five.
That's right, blud. Man's got five links

Five! None. Five! None. Five! None.
Heh-heh-heh. Yes, baby.
Yeah. Nah, nah.
Man's not around tonight still, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. What you saying? What

No, no, no! Actually, you know what?
You know what it is.
It's a raving thing, you get me?
Ministry. Next Hype.
Yes, baby, you know it's about
sex in the afternoon, innit?
Sex after "Kyle" and lick a bit of head
after "Dickinson's Real Deal".
Yes, babes. Listen, come to mine
Friday about 12, yeah?
Man's tongue's ready, baby.
I said I'll rub your belly, baby.
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.
Ha-ha! Man's got all these links, blud.
And I'm still with my babymama! What?
No one can't tell me nothing, blud.
Yes. Now, the only pussy I've ever
seen you with, blud, is this little prick.
- Oh!
- Lend me them creps, blud.
Oh, come on, blud.
♪ Hey, sir, can't you see the sign?
It's a double yellow line...

This is disabled parking!
You are not disabled!

Blud, I am disabled! Look at my arm.
Eh, so you are mocking less fortunate
people. You know God is watching you.
I don't care who's watching, blud!
Let them watch!
You're taking my stress levels
to a next dimension.
OK. Watch this.
It's a double yellow line.
Are you watching?
Let me...

Why can't that flippin' orang-utan

He's lucky I didn't spark him, you know.
Real talk.
Whatever, man. What we on?
- I gotta handle some business, innit?

He's going home to masturbate

Unlike you, fam,
I have responsibilities to take care of.
So, K, er... where are we going?

Kitchen now.
Boy, I'll eat it, pass it.

Oh, yeah, thanks for waking her up.

Because if there's anything wrong, all

- No what?
- Longage. No long ting, innit?
- Right, yeah.
Everything's cool.
Couldn't be better.
But you ain't gotta keep
coming round bringing food.
- I do, though, Yasmin.
- No, seriously, you don't.
I do, though, cos you are
my cousin's baby mums, innit?
And now he's all banged up

Cos you're family,

I feel kinda bad, innit? Like when
my cousin got shift... well, I was there.
And I feel like somehow I was
responsible, like it was my fault.
It was your fault.
Well, yeah, sort of.
Well, it sort of was and it wasn't.
Cos I warned them about...
Look, what's done is done, yeah?
It's in the past.
Look, K, you ain't gotta keep
coming around checking up on us.
Yasmin, I do not shy away
from responsibility.
Cos man's

For God's sake, K,
what is the matter with you?
Look, I don't want you to talk to me.
I don't want you to wait for me.
I don't want you to do nothing, yeah?
Nothing.
You're on your period, innit? It's cool.
The way I see it,
you're a helpless woman, innit?
When you had my cousin,
you had someone there for you,
but now he's in the dustbin,
who have you got?
You ain't got no one. So, that's what
I'm saying. I'm here for you, Yasmin.
When you are in need,
that's when you can call K.
I swear, I sent you
a friend's request, man.
- You wanna do something for me?
- Yes, I do, Yasmin.
See these DVDs that Leroy sold me?
- It's Lesoi.
- Whatever. They don't work.
What?
Pow!
So, what you saying, blud?
You know I love my boys skinny, innit?
I could eat you up in one bite,

So, how about you take

Sure. Why not?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

Just hurry up, man.
Don't worry, Yasmin.

Just play the game.
Come, rematch, innit?
Fuck the game, man.
You're shit anyway, man.
What? How am I shit, blud?
You're just jammy, man.
Er... jam is something you put on toast

Now I'm saying come,

and you wanna play "Street Fighter".
You're just pissed off, yeah, cos
I keep beating you at your own game.
You think you're so nang at everything,
gassing like you're some gangster.
But I can tell you for nothing now,
you are not a gangster, fam.
You ain't got no P,
no whip, no links, no girl.
The only thing you got is a pet hamster,
and even he don't like you, blud.
You know, K,
it is perfectly OK to just be yourself.
What? Shut up, man.
So Solid had lyrics about man like you.
I'm on to you.
You are an official hater, blud.
Me, I'm on big tings out here, G.
- What big tings, blud?
- Bookie, man.
Big tings? You don't even work no more,
blud. You don't shot.
The music ting flopped. What big tings?
Delusion. That's what you're on.
Blud, man's only known
the yoot for five minutes
and even he knows, be yourself, blud.
Try that.
Wasteman.
All right, cool.
Gone, innit? If that's what you man
really think, I'm out of here.
- Prick.

'In the 1990s, I joined a group of
people called the Demon Drummers... '
I hope you're pleased with yourself.
They took everything.
It's not Kenneth's fault, sweetie.
What you throwing stones

- I wanna start shotting, blud.

- Hear me out, innit, man?
- Ah, look, K, I'm tired, man.
Blud, hear me out, fam.
I got a little movement lined up, innit?
I got all my shots sorted.
I know I can do this, man.
- I'm just asking for a little bit of help.
- You know I can't help you, man.
Yeah, but your uncles can, though.
I just need a little skunk, innit?
Something to get me started,
and then I'll be all right.
Don't let what Bookie said get to you.
He was just vex about the game.
The bailiffs have taken all our shit.
I need to get some money together,
and fast, man.
- I'm desperate out here, blud.
- You're too bait, man.
No, I won't be, blud, I promise.
I'll hold it down. I swear.
Blud, if it was my food, man might
try and sort something out, blud.
But that's my uncle's skunk, blud.
Man can't afford for that to go wrong.
That's way too risky. Family
or no family, them man will kill me.
You're the only family
I've got right now, blud.
Please, man.
Come round tomorrow morning.
Man'll try and sort something out then.
Ah, blud, I ain't gonna forget this, man.
And don't worry, I won't smoke it all.
Nah, nah, nah,

And no bait moves.
The money's all there.
Nice job, yeah? Bless.
We're becoming
a fucking laughing stock.
Get up. This is my seat, rudeboy.
My seat! Sitting in my seat!
Need to respect man out here.

Best place to find a sket. Yeah.
For real.
We can't have the word going around
that we're going soft now, mate.

There's nothing soft about me.
Hey, hey.

This is now property of Tyrone.
A man takes what he wants out here,
blud. Standard procedures.
- Bookie Ebegulu, pass me your phone.
- Nah, blud!
What? Are you saying no to me, blud?
Hm? Is that what you're saying, blud?
See this, blud?
What does that say, blud?
Hm? It says property of Tyrone.
Look at it, made in Tyrone.
I swear, blud, you're lucky
your auntie knows my mum
or man would've stripped them jeans
off you right about now, fam.
No homo.
Let man know if you want
some weed, innit?
Man's got the piff, blud! Ha-ha-ha!
Man's tremendous out here, blud!
Standard procedures!
Man's intelligence has no limits, blud!
- I hate that guy, man.
- I knew this would happen, man.
- Don't worry, I'm gonna sort this out.
- How you gonna do that, blud?
- I dunno.
- You're a wasteman, blud!
Realise how much trouble I'm in, blud?
I told you.
I warned you not to be so bait, man,
but you just never listen.
- Cos he's a wasteman.
- This ain't my fault.
It is your fault, man.
It's always your fault.
- You're too fucking bait.
- 100 per cent waste.
Why did you bring all that food out
with you? And why you licking shots?
Tyrone was right.
It's like you wanted him to rob you.
Nah, man, I just didn't think.
That's your problem, K.
You never think, man.
All of us, man, got robbed cos of you.
Fuck, man!
My uncles are gonna kill me.
But that's not your problem, is it?
On top of that, I lost my PSP.
This is fucking dead, man.
I'm going home, man.
- Don't call me no more, K.
- But, Bookie, I will get your stuff back!
- Whatever, blud!
- I will!
I defended you, blud.
Even though everyone I know
warned me not to hang around with you.
You know what? Bookie's right, blud.
Your whole life's one big joke, man.
You try and bring next man down
with you. I ain't in it no more, K.
Lesoi, seriously, I'm sorry, man.
No, "sorry" don't cut it this time, blud.
Lesoi!
You're still jamming out for a bit, yeah?
I think I should probably go home.
I promised Patricia
I would be home early.
- Goodbye, K.
- Yeah.

You break a man's heart.
And by the way, learn to speak,

Man's not spastimacated, you know.
It's just a speech impediment.
Oh, my days, blud!

You.
I don't care. I want my money
by the end of tomorrow, nigga.
No, you. You better get it for me.
If not, me gonna carve
a bludclot 'C'
from the corner of your eye
to the corner of your mouth.
You just get me my money.

"Look, I want my money tomorrow."
That's not gonna work. That doesn't
have any effect whatsoever.
No, you got to put a little bass
behind it. You know?
You...
That's powerful, a lot more powerful
than "Can I have my money, please?"
They just won't take me seriously.
Now, with...
You.
I want my money now. Yes, you.

You're sounding like a bigger cow.
