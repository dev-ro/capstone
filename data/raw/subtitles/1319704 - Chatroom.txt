-So, what...
is the usefulness of collecting
young people from Chelsea?
That's a great question, Emily.
William?
I think it's just fun
to talk with each other.
Make new friends,

Well, how we start a conversation?
Choose someone you hate, share it with the
Group and from there we talk further.
I am Mo.

People who hate TV
people who think...
that the people who watch TV
idiots,
such people I hate.
-Because TV is so important?
Yes.
-Do you watch much TV?
Yes, often enough.
-It is important to have a hobby.
It is not a hobby.
-It just keeps you busy?
That is called just a
regular life, William.
Okay.
-Who hate you, William?
Shit.
-Ahead!
I hate not really something.
-But there is surely something you irritate?
Grace Rollins.
-I think its great books on Ripley!
And they annoy me to no end.
-But she writes just fine.
She is fake!
-They are interested in children with history.
When I Ripley goes to Pompeii
had read, I had no need...
more to read more
about Pompeii or volcanoes.
So good it is!
That is one of the things triestste
I have ever heard.
Really true?
If you have a few minutes time,
I would like to show you something.
Boys and girls, it is the
black plague...
... in the style of Grace Rollins.

Chronicle of
Grace Rollins

He has saved the day Magic.
Typical for grace Rollins.
Hate your hair?
Well done, William.
I mean, I'm a media work together
and, I've never seen anything like this.
To Grace Rollins pissing off, you have
even a stronger point?
All the lies that were told
Since our childhood.
Suppress The teenagers.
-Good point.
It should come back to our parents,
right?
Do you think our parents
afraid of us?
Yes. And that they should too.
We are higher educated than them.
And we are better connected to the world.
-But they see it not the case,
they see the opposite.
They see us as an experiment.
I don't know what my parents were planning
with me,
But apart from that, have
they ruined me.
But not intentional.
-Oh, no.
It is usually a conscious decision to
you to ruin it, Jim.
I'm smarter and better able to me
to adapt than my parents.
But... you are still a child.
Absolutely.
Take the power, Emily.
-Power?
Yes. You know
how in the world.
What moves the people?
Yes!
-You would need to have more ambitions!
Seize the moment!
Create something of the world!
Create, or death something?
-Yes.
How about all three?
In order to let count
You should use the life, right?
So if we're the next two months
explore the world?
Class!
-Creative and positive.
You are truly a teenager
with an exclamation point.
Sorry, but that sounds
like a lot of nonsense.
We need to come together.
-Absolutely.
I would love to chat on a regular basis.
I also.
And I too. Eva?
Yes. Yes, why not.
-Great!
And you know, William?

Take your time.
So. ..
Good afternoon, ladies.

This is a gold carp.
Yes. I have just bought him.
Have you purchased a dead.
Damn.

She is enigs child.
Been A second was fine
but that's just not.
It all sounds so desperate
us change
in such boring people.
Dom and vulgar.
That is an excellent combination.
I know we are fortunately
If they are accepted as they are.
I want us all to shake.
And I like their love,
I really.
The closest thing I've ever at
have been him
was when my father suffered from
prostate cancer.
That tumor from behind
is a happy event...
... and was the happiest time of our lives.
Do you think a terminal illness
to simulate?
I've never tried it.
And violence?
You really Believe that?
A family who feels threat
keeps always together.
Is that true?
A little fear... and they
stop socializing...
... and go back to basics for love
of their daughter.
Do you think?
-It is a signal, Emily.
You'll even do them a favor.
-Okay.
So, because the HCR
of yourself...
do you think you have some random violence
You can go wild on your parents?
I would try some random violence.
-Excellent.
I know, of course, not
where to start.
Well, William and I can come up with something.
Some small tricks, to
to begin with. Yes however, William?
I oppose
premeditated murder.
But what random violence is fine.
-Brave boy.
This is great!
-Let's make a start.
Who is Jim?
That's nice.
-Just a little color, right?
You don't talk so much.
Are you shy,
or should you people just don't like?
Shy.
Do you allow yourself to have friends?
No.
Do you think you're still

I'm not in Tony Layton PC hacks.
And his name is added to the
database of...
assailants.
Paedophiles.
-Have you hacked him so quickly?
We must protect this room so that
only us fives in May.
Do you think everyone pedophile

Depending on the age

Years.
We are talking about you?
Maybe.
Have you tried something?
-No! And I am ashamed of myself, I...

Paedophiles are barred.
-Well...

-I hope that the new device like it.
You have the password?
-Of course.
Dead Ripley.
This is not cool, huh?
William, you should be with us.
I can't do this,
come on down.
I have friends.
Online friends?
Yes.
You won't get better by
to talk with strangers.
You want to make sure that the guy who you were
not return, right?
No, so I don't want to be.
Then come and talk to us.
We simply want you better.
Only... only this here yet.
So, Jim. It is your turn.
What?
Something you want to share with us?
Those who hate you?
I don't know for sure.
It's tricky.
-Come on! Come on...
get personal.
Who is it?
Who hate Jim?
Myself.
Really true?
Hate you know yourself?
And what would that be?
Is your family situation okay?
Yes. Yes.
I have no father,
but my mother is
very very nice.
And you hate yourself,
because...
I have two years
Antidepressants swallowed.
And... did you benefit?
Do you know if they have helped?
I do not know. Maybe.
Let the medications.
If you want to feel human again...
Let them then.
You know it yet, Jim?
Yes. Yes.
We are your friends.
If you're brave enough
in order to leave the medications...
Then we are there for you.
Or not?
-For sure.
Yes, certainly.
Would you guys do That?
-Yes, we want to bear in mind that you are alone.
You know...
some would like to...
unknown continue here.
Do you think...
that we can see
How to get there really?
Jim?
That would really help.
Yes. Yeah, well good.
You are not with me about
If a good Samaritan.
What are you going to do?
What demons.
Give Him a few answers.
We are a little on the
playing with Emily.
Do you want a little with
Jim Frolic?
Maybe.
Only perhaps?
You are tomorrow's birthday, right?
Yes.
Therefore, I supposed
a gift for you to buy.
Those who hate you?
It is good that you join
I appreciate that.
Well... I want to help.
Tell even where are you from?
-Tell me what you're going to do with me?
Do you love handcuffs?
She is very beautiful.
And she does to Gymnastics.
She is very smart.
But... I was attracted to her,
and that's odd.
Do you want that I'm Keisha?
Not it is in order, thank you.
When do you do here if you Keisha
so nice find.
My friend said it before.
In order to look on the Internet.
To see what
the adult women like it.
No children at the head?
-Yes, that was the thought.
Unless you're a perverseling,
take me on each
way that you can.
I love rape games.
What?
-Come to Leeds.
Behind my house is a brakliggend
plot of land.
You would be able to take me there!
-Jesus Christ!
You are so damn sweet!
I've always been such a sweet little boy wanted...
... who me in my mouth wants to fuck!
Where are you going?
It was a bit strange,
It felt...
It felt like I
raped was, to be honest.
This felt wrong.
People abuse these rooms to the ongoing
band, don't worry.
Yes, but in one way or another
It was weird. You understand that?
Listen, say Sayu
what you feel for Keisha.
What?
Friendship is about understanding
and forgive each other.
It's not that you have something
have done wrong.
That's right.
-Yes. The heart is uncontrollable.
Tell him that, he will understand.
Okay, I will try.
-I have a gift I give away.
Can you just take over?
See you.
-Laters.
Laters.
Dead Ripley.
You just can't stay away.
It is impossible.
Please.
I listen all
calls, all emails.
All information that they drop.
I stuck her face
those bodies.
She is apparently
two year porn star.
I have "Modelz One" hacked...
... and work some more subtle
to its portfolio.
I renew her nose,
make her lip narrower,
reduce the distance between the eyes.
It is striking, but sufficient.
My God. I know I said
I hate her.
But you know...
have her really killed.
I know it. Isn't that wonderful?
Thank you so much, William.
Happy birthday, Eva.
What do you do?
-Watching it.
Maybe watching a dvd?
Yes, Yes.
-Kate Winslet.
I find that bitch great.
I need somewhere with your
talk about it.
That sounds serious.
Keep it short.
Do you remember,
When a girl was in the game?
You are gay!
-No. ..
No.
I have a maid.
Who is it? Forward,
Hey, who is she?
Keisha.
Keisha, your sister.
You take me in the grind!
-No, I don't.
She is still but eleven!
I know it.
-You have touched her?
No!
-But that was your plan.
I wanted to talk to you.
-I am not a pimp!
There is nothing to talk about!
She is a little girl of eleven!
Pedophile!
We can talk about, a quietly
without that you have the money goes?
I have done nothing.
The heart is uncontrollable. Sy.
The heart is uncontrollable?
-Yes.
What is this? homotaal
DEATH
Tell me what, Jim.
We are all here for you.
I was seven years old.
And... my mother was away
in the weekend.
Being away from it all, or something.
My father stayed with me.
to me to mind.
And...
We sat at a table in the kitchen
just looking at each other.
And he asked me what I wanted to do.
I said immediately,
I want my cowboypak to, and to the
Penguins are going to look at the Zoo.
Fun.
It would be nice.
What do you think?
I'm sure your song
one fan.
So. ..
We went to the Zoo.
And I... I walk straight
to the penguins.
And I am in my cowboypak,
looking at the penguins.
And I have such a fine conversation with my father.
It was...
the perfect day for a child.
He left my hand.
And said he would would come back.
And he goes away.
He is gone.
And I am glad
I see the penguins.
But...
It was about an hour ago
that he left.
And I started to walk around
in the Zoo.
Looking for him.
But I am still no worries.
I talk to no one
I go to the bus stop where we are
get out, I step in. ..
and say the driver
our address.
He asks me
where my parents are.
And I say that they are at home.
They wait on me.
I took out the key
under the mat.
And I go inside
There is nobody at home.
It was a Saturday night.
I am in bad.
And I pulled my pajamas.
Because my father that would have wanted.
That...
It was dark outside.
I'm starting to worry me.
I grab a blanket,
go to the bathroom
and do door locked.
With the door shut
It feels safer.
He does not go back.
He will never come back.
What did your father you...
you leave
like a dog,
that is incredible.
I don't know why, but...
I feel better.
Perhaps because I've been told that story.
-You will not be better.
Say that well either.
-And what should I say then?
You're within two weeks
will be happy again?
No, I have...
I hope, William.
I have to remain positive.
No, you're down
and in panic!
First you need to understand where
you have to do with it.
Are we going?
Listen.
Talk to people who
have experienced the same thing as you.
I know a room.
Called "Dörfli." 
I can get you there in.
It will help you.
Jim.
It helped me.
Well then.
Yes, okay.
And we're still friends?
-Yes.
Yes. That is to say, we can
our differences.
But I'm not going away at you, Jim.
I would never do
What did your father.
What are you doing?
Was your Conference?
Give it to me.
This is really sick!
Out!
Get out!
That is mine! Enter here!
It is from me! Give back!
Thunder!
William?
Please, sweetheart.
Don't do crazy things.
Do the door open!
I need to know that you know yourself
nothing will do.
It is but a video
on the Internet.
I am now over it.
I love you.
You can always
talk to me, do you remember, William?
Mobile phone!
It is necessary that I come in that room.
Whining in there,
that children,
You might want the whole stuff
destroy.
We can have it somewhere else?
Yes of course.
Are you flirting with me on it?
I had to rescue of those
terrible guests...
you friends.
So. ..
We are now a couple?
After I Jim have crucified.
You can safely through to the
next step.
Do you mean a real meeting?
You need such things
rush.
You never know
who you can trust.
Naughty bastard.
Do I need to call a doctor?
No.
No, it is though.
Then later on call me, okay?
I love you.
He wasn't man enough
in order to raise a child.
It would have been better if they but with
their two had been.
So, he hated you
because you were born?
Maybe.
For a child to blame
for his shitty life.
Hopefully he shot himself to death.
Have you ever held a weapon?
Never.
Scary things.
That would be fun!
-To tennis look?
Henry his father has a box,
with a roof above us.
Another day with those people, and I
would have bitten off my hands.
Okay, I'll be there!
-Don't do it, stay where you are!
You live right next to me.
You have no hate us?
-What are you talking about?
We are a bunch of pathetic girls,
Charlotte.
Love.
-Do you know why can you can't see?
Because you know your head in that
privileged ass of you're stuck!
We are horrible people!
You're late.
Where were you doing?
I have cleared my past.
Smart.
Yes, but how can I
actually know
who you really are?
Don't you think
you choke him leave?
You are there begun.
You come here with a small problem,
and she turns into a nightmare.
I believe these things are not.
-But if you're in such a way someone plague
then they have every right to yours
to hate.
I know.
He is your brother.
He will forgive you is not so easy.
Now it feels
as if you are not entitled to forgiveness, right?
Do they really think it helps?
Do you think want to injure yourself?
-That makes her nothing.
I'm too tired to think about.
They'll all beat.
And if you think,
that they have stopped,
then they start over again.
You take fate
into their own hands.
You understand that?
-This is wrong.
By the end of your life...
-You can fight against it.
fight your against it.
-You took just a little bit of fun with him out.
Of course I do that.
Jim. Who will be the fastest?
Of course, mine.
Because mine has very
a lot of fire.
Beautiful boys.
I know the patterns
of what can happen.
I recommend as best I can.
But why is the room hidden?
Some children can't decide,
If they feel
that they meet the depression
can escape.
It is a safe room...
to commit suicide.
Do you have the last time
suicidal tendencies?
Yes.
And why do you still
still not done?
Give him a few days,
Let him suffer a little more.
And then he will crumble.
And that's all what you are trying to do?
Of course.
But, why?
He...
He reminds me of a
boy, who I've known.
That...
lonely and pathetic boy.
I really hate that reminder.
Where are you
at the moment?
In my bedroom.
So, you're alone?
Yes.
And what about you?
More or less.
Are you a happy person,
William?
I am definitely not happy.
But at this time...
at the moment so with you,
I have never been so lucky.
Welcome.
Welcome, everybody.
The books of Ripley the time traveler

She is really
an extraordinary writer.
So, ladies and gentlemen,
the woman herself,
My mother, Grace Rollins.
Thanks, Ripley.
This is the eighth...

I started writing these books

Therefore, it seemed to us a good place
to our book presentation here.
I would like to purchase all our friends

The past year in particular.
My family
means everything to me.
I am very very proud
on both my sons.
That they are healthy,
and here with me today...
... that's really great.
I have them embarrassed,
but still
... I dedicate the book to Paul,
William, and Ripley.
Thank you.
Beautiful.
How are you?
Can I ask you to a few people
proposals, Grace?
It is good. Go but.

-No!
Give me that!
-No, no, no. Papa!
I need...
-I need to talk with MOM, okay?
I have to go. I have to
stop where I am working on. Where is she?
You keep on your room
If you are dedicated.
You are nothing else than jerk!
-No.
Jim?
Are you ready for your session?
They are all waiting for you.
Yes, William.
THE DESTRUCTIVE LIFE
OF MISERABLE JIM
Born in the hope of his father from
to save a uniepolaire depression.
Born to a mother, who
him dressed as the perfect entertainment.
The Rugby, the screens.
ARC schietkunst.
Dad, are you now
happy with me?
Are you now happy,
papa?
What did I do?
He decided to stay indoors
and to pray for
a child to play with.
But after a fruitful year
of blanks shooting...
pops up his father...
... in an even deeper
depression.
You are worthless!
I don't want another...
miserable child.
I'm telling you: I can't
even look at him!
At a terrible day left his father
him behind in the Zoo.
his family behind in the shit.
You destroyed me, man!
I'm away from here!
On the 1st anniversary of
his father's disappearance...
... swallows the boy
his very first valium.
He was eight years old.
-I'm actually eight and a half.
The pills help a little bit
against the voices in his head.
But he knows in his soul
the fault of his father's grief...
the disappearance of his father.
The probable death of his father.
If any other poor
misguided fool on this planet
he tries to find answers
on the World Wide Web.
Hey, man!
Go, USA!
Yes, man, I'm going to do it!
Like the other members
the suicide Club
he suddenly had a hunch...
... "Maybe I should
commit suicide? "
"I'm sorry that I was born, and 
that you've gotten sicker by me, dad."
"It's all my fault!"
"And I'm sorry
that I was your way have hunted, Dad!"
"I'm sorry, excuse
me, Dad!"
"Sorry!"
So tangible to see...
... it will always be difficult.
Jim should his depression...
... in a kind of Act of
expression invert.
I see what you
are doing.
Just me and Jim
have some appreciation...
... for what happens.
"You have no idea
where I am working on "!
This is going to Jim, who in the
reconcile.
His past kill!
-It's so cruel!
It is a well-documented
psychotherapy, Emily.
Yes, and it works.
-And what makes you an expert?
Keep your mouth!
-What do you know about depression?
How should I know?
-Have you written a book about?
My mother committed suicide, Mo!
She was like... Jim.
And his father.
And I...
have the last two years have to live with.
And I know how exhausting it is.
I can imagine...
... that my mother comes to my room
and I see there are on the ground.
Every day they looked to me,
She thought of my father.
I had to do what for both of us would be better.
I need this round.
It is about time that I met him once.
I redeemed him out of his suffering.
Are you going to kill him?
-I help him to commit suicide,
that is something quite different.
And we are all involved.
That is why we are here.
Therefore, you are my friend.
You don't think
I give anything to your little identity crisis?
Because, you have such a hard life!
Thinking about how you can make to an end?
Yes, there are a few people that I could call.
Not necessarily.
If they need you.
Hello, Lucy. What happened?
Why do you ask that bitch above not?
Is Eva home, Sir?
Eva! Come on down!
Jim. Do you want to open the door.
I am concerned, do open.
Everything is in order?
Everything is okay.
Go but.
I have something I want to give you.
Take your pick from where you want to meet me.
Dead Ripley.
Love here, Jim!
This is not what you want!
William has lied to you! Against us all.
About his mother.
She has never committed suicide, look!
Look at your mother, right?
Yes, that will be.
Mine is a spoiled cow. Bitch!
I don't know why he does it.
But William wanted you dead.
I just see That.
Do you think I need advice have wannabee pedophile?
If you have a conscience had put a gun to your head.
I just wanted to help.
You better pray that as William is ready with me...
He has the energy 
and the dedication to a fellow like you to destroy!
You're the, eh?
If you point me in the road runs,
make your life a hell.
I need to do something!
-Such as what?
Jim to find, and tell him what's going on!
How would you like to get out of it, Mo.
Why not?
-Because I was in your system.
And I will be completely erased.
Make you there fast, fast!
We have to go Jim!
Where do I go to return?
-What is it with my computer, Mo?
It is William! We must return to the scene!
Damn!
-I need your help!
On the drive from Charing Cross, to one hour!
I've you need help.
Emily, here's Mo.
Hello!
-Hello.
Hello!
Who is he?
-A computer genius.
How would you like to find Jim?
-Take me to the chatroom.
Once we are, we delve inside him.
Dead Ripley.
Decide where we can take.
Where my father hath left behind.
Love, please. Ahead!
William has already previously attempted.
In his own way, he survived.
But he respects Jim his wish to die.
Just as I will do.
-But this has nothing to do with he want.
William has him broken!
Let's see him online.
-Yes.
You're already in there somewhere?
-You have promised to be with me.
I am now. Create the envelope. -No, please, don't do it.
This goes between me and Jim, Eva.
You have no idea.
And now go!
Your father... your father...
He left you, Jim.
I have to you imagined.
You can escape.
What we're now poised to go about it
that makes you a hero to me!
Jim!
Where are we?
-He kills you, Jim!
I do it!
-No!
Please, Jim!
-If you do then you address them.
It is not safe, Jim!
You said you would be with me. You got me alone!
Stay where you are!
-You got me alone!
Stay where you are, I'll get.
-This is not correct.
I have to go home! I have to be anywhere. But not here!
I must go.
-No
Racing!
-Don't do it!
You know... you know...
Jim!
Leave me alone!
Damn!
What ails you? Can you hear me?
He has a gun!
Jim! What are you going to do?
Are you going to do it? You're going to do it!
Your fathers hate that you will never escape.
Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger. You are killing him.
Jim! Do it!
Do it, now. Do it.
I know that he hated me, William!
It's not about me.

I want to help you!
I try to help you.
You understand that, don't you?
No.
I really hope it hurts!
