Bengal. O'golden beauty...
...we love you.
1962, Calcutta.
A city of rickshaws and trams.
Evenings spent in
'The Coffee House'.
A city hungry for social change.
Undying in its faith
in Goddess Kali.
Dripping with the
sweet syrup of rasgullas.
Tantalizing with its spicy treats.
From the bounce
of the football...
...to the bustle of bazaars.
A city of political debates...
...obsessed with reform.
A city of joy and love.
Lolita and Shekhar's city.
And tonight the city celebrates
Shekhar's marriage to Gayatri,
daughter of Shyamlal Tantiya.
Son of and only heir
to the city's rich
and famous industrialist Navin Rai...
...the managing director
of Rai Constructions,
Shekhar Rai.
Shekhar. Shekhar.
Behold the handsome groom.
A couplet in your honour
They will sigh... some even die...
...as tonight you look...
quite dashing.'
How do I look?
Quit staring.
Just say I look like a freak.
Congratulations, sir.
My lady has requested you to come.
If possible please come.
Go meet her.
Aunt's here. I better run.
Hurry up.
Lady... you and your tales
...some sweet,
some tall,
They're endless. Some outright fake.
Here's the story of the
bride and groom.
He was a simpleton,
she in full bloom.
Her beauty had travelled
far and wide...
...made the hearts of many
burn with spite.
But how did they meet?
Tell us the tale of the wedding night.
"Please tell us."
God knows what possessed the bride...
...locked the door and sulked inside.
The puzzled groom knocked
the door silly.
Thought -
'This the end of my story.'
My darling, don't torture me this way...
...please tell me the
follies of my way.
His friends then explained...
- What did they say?
Want her back?
Be sweet, be false.
Only then will your queen agree.
'Do you want the moon
and stars, my bride? '
She said, 'Could you be more trite? '
'My life is yours to keep,' he said...
'Consider it over, it's so cheap.'
So how did they meet?
Tell us the tale of the wedding night.
He came to me, I said -
'What good are stars, silly boy? '
Armed with my magic words,
He went over to her, not so coy.
What did he say?
'I've brought you silver and gold.'
She said,
'The door's now half unbolt.'
I have brought diamonds and
pearls with me, my queen.
The bride then opened the door.
Aunt Vasundhara.
You're here, son?
What's happening?
Even your uncle...
Girish handled everything.
A son-in-law like him is a blessing.
He is more than a son.
He is our backbone now.
He wanted to meet you.
What happened then?
Please tell me.
Meet him and go,
he's on his way...
Some other time, aunt.
OK. I'll ask him to look you up.
Good bye, aunt.
Bye. Oh. Congratulations.
Shekhar.
Leaving already?
Without meeting me?
Can't you even look at me?
Heard you're getting married tonight?
Have you forgotten me completely?
Don't want to see me, meet me...
...even touch me?
Maybe you do want to touch...
You're shameless. Married women
don't utter such things.
It's because I'm married...
I feel no shame, no fear, just...
Stop it Lolita. I'm not Girish...
I know the real you.
And who am I? Tell me...
A shameless betrayer,
pretending to be a faithful...
...innocent wife.
That's what you are.
Have you composed this?
No, it's Tagore's, stupid.
Koel, who's this?
Lolita. Her parents died
in a car accident...
...now she stays with us.
Hey, Koel. There's some fresh
tamarind pickle for you.
Tamarind?
Lolita, have some too.
No. I don't eat pickle.
OK.
But I wouldn't mind some
mango pickle.
So still is my heart's beat...
...aching to hear the bells of your feet.
My life has lost its melody...
...my songs are mute with defeat.
From dusk until dawn,
your memory rules my mind.
Why does my hand seek yours?
Were you ever mine?
Tell me... tell me... tell me...
The flowers see the bee swing,
like your vision in my mind.
Trees hear the nightingale sigh,
'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'
How much? - Twenty five paise.
I don't want it.
Show me...
Not bad. Why were you
returning it, stupid?
No money.
You need money, right?
Oh, boy. Come.
Here's my pocket money
- take it anytime.
There's no need to ask anyone.
Not even you?
No. Need any now?
No.
Here, keep the keys.
How long will this dreary night last?
Tell me...
How can I erase our past?
Tell me...
Lolita. Come up. - Coming.
Will my arms find you again?
Will your perfume fill me again?
Will your love ever ebb away?
Were our bonds made of clay?
From dusk until dawn...
...your memory rules my mind.
Why does my hand seek yours?
Were you ever mine?
Tell me... tell me... tell me...
See, Lolita is wearing a sari.
Not bad.
Hey Lolita.
What happened?
- Came first in my class.
Then come up immediately.
Coming...
So what do you want?
A small statue of Lord Krishna,
for your room.
My room?
So?
Shekhar.
The flowers see the bee swing,
like your vision in my mind.
Trees hear the nightingale sigh,
'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'
Flowers see the bee swing,
like your vision in my mind.
Trees hear the nightingale sigh,
'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'
Shekhar.
Hurry up and get dressed,
the prayer is about to start.
Hey, you'll get burnt. - So will you.
Hey, Lolita.
Come up, I've got a new tune.
Hang on. I've just come back.
Why fret, Mr. Gurucharan?
You own a palatial house...
This house is a gold mine,
a treasure.
Tell you what - sell it
and buy a modest place.
Unthinkable. My grandfather had built...
...this house with so much love...
...you could see it from anywhere.
Hello, sir.
Hello.
And... in any case its mortgaged.
Mortgaged?
Since when?
Three years back when
I got a heart attack...
...Navin Rai lent me
100,000 rupees... just like that.
But your home is worth
at least two million?
Navin Rai though a gentleman,
is also a businessman.
When the interest added
up to 150,000 rupees...
...the house had to be mortgaged.
I've promised to repay
by 30th November...
...I really need that
extension on my job.
Mr. Jones has made up
his mind... its over.
This is your final pay package.
Exactly 10,809 rupees.
See you. No, I really must go.
Thanks and all the best.
Lolita. Lolita.
Mom.
Why isn't she here yet?
She'll get here.
Who asked her to get a job?
She's obsessed with her office now.
See you soon.
Mom.
You asked your father
to employ her.
Lolita.
Later... Shekhar's calling.
But we need the cake tomorrow.
OK, tell me.
Koel, you're so stubborn...
Sis-in-law won't accept
any other recipe.
Now tell me...
Lolita. - See?
Corn flour?
200 grams. He's just so impatient.
Yeah... next.
What next? I'll have to go now...
I am talking about the recipe,
come on tell me.
What's next after chocolate powder?
Spoon Vanilla, 200 grams butter...
he must be sulking now.
I'm off.
The cake...? Sis?
We need eggs, right? - In what?
Your head... Shekhar,
Shekhar, Shekhar.
Such an expensive pen?
Must have blown your paycheck.
Nope. I have fifty paise left.
Play the tune.
I don't know...
You are mine...
Say you are mine...
Nice.
Thank you.
Put some words to it.
The lover said something,
so did the lass
alas.
I do not know.
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow,
but why it sways,
I do not know.
Not bad. Hear this...
Matters of the heart,
the heart of the matter...
...should always be
locked in the heart.
My lips are sealed,
with bolts and keys...
...but through my eyes
my love is revealed.
The lover said something,
so did the lass
What they said, alas.
I do not know
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow,
but why it sways,
I do not know.
The lover said something,

I do not know
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow,
but why it sways,
I do not know.
Now imagine
- A girl, a little cranky, a bit mad...
You know, like you.
Really? - And a boy.
Bright as a star?
- No. Madder than she.
How else would they fall in love?
One day, in the church...
I once asked a river,
'Where do you scurry to, silly? '
'Far is your sweetheart's dwelling
why do you spiral hither and thither? '
A trifle bashful,
a wee bit fearful...
...she skipped, she tripped, she leaped.
All she cared was to rush to her lover...
just like me, my dear.
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow,
but why it sways,
I do not know.
The lover said something,
so did the lass
what they said, alas.
I do not know
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow,
but why it sways,
I do not know.
I once asked a cloud, dense with rain,
'Where are you floating to, silly? '
'Can't you see this parched landscape?
Descend on it regally.'
She shivered a little,
quaked some more,
she yawned a mighty, mighty roar.
Then she poured on me, a rain of love
...just like you, my dear.
The lover said something,
so did the lass
what they said, alas.
I do not know
My heart sways gently,
Never so slow,

I do not know
My heart sways gently,
Never so slow,
but why it sways,
I do not know.
That's for sure.
We'll handle the rest at the recording.
I've taken a hundred.
So?
For the pen. Do the math.
Have you gone crazy?
With my head for numbers?
Its all about numbers.
The concession we get is our profit.
You can't give it away to those people.
But uncle... I mean, sir,
profiting from a charitable hospital...
...is important. They're charitable, not me.
Know this. A profitless deal
is a bad one.
Got it?
Yes, sir.
Hello. Yes, Rajeshwari...
You know we have to go in the evening.
What?
It's Shekhar's marriage, not mine.
'Won't see the girl.'
Has he given any thought to his future?
A girl from such an illustrious
family is hard to find.
Gayathri is Lala Shyamlal Tantiya's
daughter.
Enough. He has to be
ready in the evening.
And you... no, forget it.
'Don't want to see the girl.'
Where were we?
'A profitless deal is a bad one.'
Stop fretting needlessly.
Has Navin Rai asked for anything?
And what if he does?
Can we suddenly produce
that kind of cash?
Even you, Vasundhara...
A gentleman like him would
never do such a thing.
And we know him for decades...
Sir, I'm in a bit of a rush.
Lets go.
Any problem, sir?
Nothing. Please sit.
This year we want less
drummers for the festival.
What?
Three are enough.
What? The whole colony
comes here to celebrate...
I know, but times are hard.
But Mrs. Rai has already paid
for the arrangements.
She wants it to be grand...
I've even got an advance.
She's already paid? - Yes. I told you,
stop fretting needlessly.
Hello.
Hello.
Shekhar had sent word for you...
OK.
Heard you've got a job now, dear?
Yes, sir.
Then I expect a present this festival...
Sure.
I take your leave.
Amazing. They've already paid.
Why tell me? I told you.
Lolita, freshen up quickly.
- Why?
Because without you
Calcutta stops functioning.
Has sis returned?
There you go. - Now what?
Their cake isn't ready.
Charu has called for you
ten times for the cake.
Shekhar's sent word twenty times.
Shall I cut myself into two?
Three. What will I do without you?
Four. Sis-in-law's cake needs you.
No, five. What about your uncle?
Hey, six. For me.
Oh. We forgot about Shekhar.
Awful weather upstairs?
Tempers are soaring.
- Stop drooling.
Has to meet a girl,
but he's still on the piano.
Please help him, or your uncle...
And why have you come so late?
Just fifteen minutes late.
A minute's delay...
from you ruins the schedule
of this house.
Now run.
Lolita will light up the
house she marries into.
Yes.
She will go to a house
where she's appreciated...
...not where she's a
namesake mistress.
Not ready yet?
Don't you want to see the girl?
I could die.
Does the entire city know?
I don't want to meet any girl.
Dad's so stubborn.
Navin uncle.
Grow up Lolita, it's not even funny.
Please pick out a decent shirt
from my crappy wardrobe.
God. Such fuss.
Here.
Wow. When did I buy this shirt?
Navin uncle got it for
you from London.
Amazing. I didn't even
know it existed.
Like many other things you have. Oh.
Navin uncle.
Not again Lolita.
Shekhar. Aren't you ready yet?
I'm ready father. Let's go.
Hurry up.
Run.
Shekhar. - Coming, father.
Good evening, Mr. Tantiya.
Hello.
My son, Shekhar.
Silly oaf.
You've got a cake load of
flour and sugar on you.
And here's a raisin for the icing.
Never think of baking another cake.
Just pray this third cake works...
Can you smell that? - What?
Something's burning.
Oh my God. Cake.
Koel, stand back... careful.
Take the plug out.
This cake is...
...resting in pieces.
- Shut up.
Oh dear.
How our hearts baked for you...
What happened? - It's about to...
...a fourth cake, by you.
Thank God, you're here.
Now we won't get egg on
our face in front of Girish.
Not egg... cake.
Who?
My brother Girish is coming
from London tonight.
He loves my homemade cakes.
Yours...
Are you ready...?
Still baking?
No, burning.
Shut up. You two get cleaned up.
Sis-in-law, relax.
I'll handle this.
- Thank you. OK, listen...
- Yes, I've got your purse.
OK. And have you...
Yes, I've filled the petrol.
Can we leave now?
- Of course. Stop chatting.
Take care of the cake and the pudding...
and shut the door.
OK.
Hello. I'm Gayatri Tantiya.
Hello. I'm...
Shekhar. I know.
I'd forgotten who I was for a second.
Happy birthday by the way...
Thank you.
Did you know Shekhar's a musician?
Hopefully it'll remain an interest.
Hi, Shekhar.
- Hi, Sidharth.
Where is your drink?
Sis, you haven't even asked him.
Come on...
I will fix you a drink.
Navin, let Shekhar and Sidharth
handle the Darjeeling Tea estate deal.
We've done our bit.
Let them handle this.
I like that even more.
What do you play?
Piano.
Did I say something funny?
Just remembered my piano lessons.
Do you play too? - No.
Tried to. Not me
my tutors did.
One after the other, all seven fled.
Cowards. Tonight could have been
your concert performance.
But I'd have missed meeting you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cake is about to be cut...
Happy birthday to you.
Hello. Please send someone
to 56, Bagh Bazaar.
We have no electricity.
Now that was a piece of cake.
Like it? I made it.
Enjoy yourselves...
- Really?
Are you mad? It's from Fluries.
I can't even boil water.
But don't worry, dad has promised
to send 6 cooks with me
when I get married.
Is that OK with you?
Or should we ask for twelve?
One to boil water, one for tea
and one for cake.
Are you serious?
Coming.
Stop breaking the door.
Here so fast?
Yes. Thought I'd surprise them.
And you are...?
Yes, I'd called for the electrician.
Electrician?
I plugged in the oven and...
poof. It blew.
Are you going to fix
it telepathically?
What happened?
The fuse has blown.
This way.
What's this?
Suite... I mean the toolbox.
Tools for any contingency.
Here's the fuse box.
Hold this.
Oh, no. - Is it bad?
Very. Flour all over.
- On the fuse?
Hold still...
Now it's OK. Got any wire?
Shouldn't you have it?
This pin will do.
Your hair looks much better open.
Got a hammer?
Hammer?
Need to break the wall
to check the wiring.
God. This is going to be
a long process.
A long affair, yes.
Could be a week, even ten days.
But I'm ready.
Can you open the tool box?
This? - That's the shaving kit.
Man's gotta shave.
Look, mister...
Can't see in the dark.
Could you hold the candle up?
Much better.
Do you think this is
an easy profession?
I have to travel to America, Japan...
just back from London.
They all know me by name...
Girish.
There you are.
Girish.
Girish Sharma.
We've been waiting
for you at the airport.
And you're standing on top here.
Come on, sis.
How are you?
Hello, brother.
Did she ask you to stand there?
No, it was the fuse...
The fuse had blown, sis.
And the cake?
Then?
I told the Britisher, 'I'm not here to
work in the steel plant'
'... I'm here to buy it.' We know.
Eat some cake.
Of course. He was shocked.
You finally learnt how to bake, sis.
Thanks.
Then?
Then I bought it
my first steel plant.
And the rest, as they say,
is history.
He's made a habit of
buying steel plants.
Have you come to buy
one this time too?
Nope. This time I've come
especially to... fix a fuse.
Just kidding. I've come here
for two reasons.
To find a Managing Partner
for my new project and...
...to help Charu find her life partner.
Brother...
He needs to see her once
in candlelight...
...love at first sight.
Then eat this cake and set a date.
This must happen in your London.
Marriages aren't a game here.
You're right. What say, sis?
Game? There's one game
in which I rule...
...can even beat
my foreign-returned brother.
Which one?
Flush.
Have you ever really
won that game?
I can, if Lolita plays with me.
I warn you, sis, I've become
a quite a champ myself.
Oh.
You don't know Lolita then...
Try me...
Really? Challenge?
Challenge.
I knew you would drag cards
in somehow.
So tomorrow afternoon
we wreck a deck.
Afternoon? I have work.
Evening then after work.
How was the girl, son?
Alright.
Come on, describe her... tall, thin...?
Mom, she was like girls are.
'Morning.
Lolita, why don't you ask
him about the girl?
He doesn't tell me anything.
So?
Pandit Nehru has said that in the
UN general assembly tomorrow...
Good looking?
Pandit Nehru?
Did you meet him last night?
Is Gayatri Tantiya very beautiful?
Didn't notice anything... nothing special.
What was she wearing?
Sort of a gown...
very English... nice dress.
Color?
Pink, slightly dark,
you know, off shoulder.
And she was wearing a beady...
'choker', right?
Maybe, but then you weren't noticing.
And her heels?
You'd fall if you wore them.
Why can't I wear heels?
They're just not you.
Besides why would you wear them?
What I can or can't do is beyond you.
Hey, I'm just saying that I've never
seen you wear them.
What you haven't seen
before isn't impossible.
Where are you going?
What about my song?
My heels will work on them.
Listen...
- Need to get to work. Bye.
Come back quickly, sis.
Hello.
If I finish I'll come.
Make some excuse.
Will try.
Please, sis. You know sis-in-law is
miserable at cards.
We'll lose without you.
Sis? Why are you wearing my heels?
You'll break them.
I told you.
Be careful...
Hey, Lolitha. Looking lovely today.
Nice heels, man.
Thanks. How was the holiday?
Great.
What the hell. Clumsy girl.
Sorry, sir.
Are you picking them or spying?
No sir, I'm just... - Shut up.
Got your morning dose.
Bam. We bumped and papers flew...
Careful. Your table is scary.
No tea for you, right?
- No.
Thanks.
What's this Heritage Hotel
project, uncle?
Heritage Hotel? Never heard of it?
Has anyone said anything?
- No. Read it on top of a file I dropped.
What was written?
Did you see anything else?
- How could I? He grabbed it.
That's 'Hitler Rai'.
- I better run before I get
an 'overdose'.
Hey, are you taking
a tonic these days?
- No
Grown tall overnight.
Chatterjee Uncle...
Checked the track lay?
Ok.
1, 2, 3, 1...
The lover said something,
I do not know what they said, alas.
So did the lass
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow
But why it sways, I do not know.
I once asked a river,
'Far, too far, is your lover's abode... '
No, no.
I'll tell them, relax. Listen up...
1, 2, 3,
'Far, too far, is your lover's abode... '
Have you written this?
I've written what I remember
of Lolita's lyrics.
Where is she?
God knows. Am I her secretary?
But you gave her the
date and time, right?
Yes.
Should've taken
an appointment...
...sent an invitation card
to her highness.
Just one Saridon, and say
goodbye to headaches.
So should we play another turn?
How do I know?
Just one more turn and...
'... good bye to headaches.'
And here's Lolita.
Welcome, please join us.
So late? We're losing miserably.
Sorry.
I'm so tired of
my lucky streak, sis.
Shut up, Lucky.
He's bluffing.
Bluff?
Koel, show me your cards.
Now what?
Nothing.
One more turn.
Are you sure?
Of course.
Think twice. The loser will...
What?
Take us all to Moulin Rouge.
Moulin Rouge.
No. The Coffee House.
- How boring.
One minute.
Are you scared of nightclubs?
Or are you not confident?
None at all.
Rubbish. Lolita, say something.
And what if you lose?
Breakfast at Fluries for all.
Fluries. Yeah...
Hold on. Let me make myself clear...
- I'm not losing.
Of course.
Sir, what if instead of the 'ocean',
the stream meets a 'boat'?
Sir, please sing what's been written.
But it's contrary to the meter.
Who's the music director here?
You, sir.
Then please sing.
Chill. He's very senior.
Sir, lets decide what the
stream meets later.
Show your hand.
Already? Where's the confidence?
We're confident, not overconfident.
Come on, show.
OK. So here's my first jack. Now you.
Hey, I asked for the show of hand.
I've bared my soul here,
and you can't show me a card?
Here's our second jack.
A pair of jacks? - Now your show.
Just a pair.
They've lost. Colour. Fluries. Fluries.
One minute.
You don't know my third card yet.
Here's my third jack.
Which means - Moulin Rouge.
You weren't bluffing?
I never bluff.
Then?
Just plain lucky.
The recording date won't come
to her in her dream?
Aren't you the arranger?
For music, not meetings.
You should've spoken to her...
If I've to say everything, then I will.
Right... Pack up, please.
If I have to do all the talking,
then hear this...
Sir, pack up.
But why?
Why didn't you tell Uncle if you
didn't want to see the girl?
Because he would've dug a hole
right then, and buried me.
Point.
How is Gayatri though?
Why? Interested?
Good heavens, no.
She is my sister-in-law.
You always play this wrong.
Always?
So sue me. Hang me.
Look, if you're going to vent
Lolita's anger on me...
Speak of the devil... Lolita.
And who's the guy?
Handsome, isn't he?
My foot. Wears a suit
and eats puchkas.
Where was he when the
British were leaving?
Take it easy, man.
The heart sways, Why?
I don't know why.
Out. - Why?
Get down.
But...
Out.
I've got no money to get home.
Sir, a penny. Just a penny would help.
Can I borrow a penny from you?
Please, just one.
No way. Scram.
I've taken 200 rupees.
We're going to Moulin Rouge
because I lost a bet.
Who's we?
Koel, Charu, Girish, sis-in-law...
Girish who?
Sis-in-law's brother from London.
Owns huge steel plants, but so simple...
I'm sure it was Sir Girish's idea to bet.
Do you know how he got
his first steel plant?
So now you know his life history.
Maybe that's why you
missed the recording.
Recording? When?
What do you care?
Cards, puckhas, night clubs...
So Koel told you about it.
And you've started hiding things.
But I'm telling you now.
After dressing up,
just before you leave?
Tell me, should I not go? - Please do.
Just don't pretend to 'ask'.
Sir Girish awaits your presence.
Shekhar, why are you...?
Just go.
I knew the plan would be ruined.
Why does this always happen?
Speak softly, Koel
...my head's pounding.
Shall I massage it?
Come on, sis. Can I get you a pill?
I'll get it for you.
Here. Come on sis,
we won't get this chance again.
You guys go ahead.
- I'm really feeling ill.
Keep some money.
They're here.
Sure you want to me go?
Go. - See you then.
Have the medicine, sis.
Where's everybody?
Right here. - Where's Lolita?
She said she'll come later. Headache.
What are you wearing?
If she's very ill let's cancel this. - Yes.
No. This is normal.
She'll be fine. Let's go.
Are you sure?
- Even Lolita has asked us to carry on.
I think we should continue. - Yes.
Should we? - Let's go.
Come on... - OK.
Oh my, a halter neck?
Aunty let you wear it?
No, these questions aren't new.
They are as old as time.
What is this riddle called life?
Can you block it can you
stop that which flows?
What is this riddle called life?
Take a sip, give in to its powers...
...and find laughter in your tears.
It makes you laugh,
It makes you wail,
All in a moment, this strange tale.
What is this riddle called life?
Can you block it can you
stop that which flows?
What is this riddle called life?
Like a twinkle in the eye...
...your tear turns into a pearl.
Like a beautiful boulevard of trees,
on a lonely long road.
What is this riddle called life?
Can you block it can you

No, these questions aren't new.

Bye. - Be good.
Thanks, Girish. I'm sorry about
messing up your shirt.
Better than your
messed up character.
Oh, shut up.
Wine stains are stubborn.
Speak softly, sis.
Careful.
You're early.
Thought you had a late night?
Yeah, it was a bit late.
And tonight?
Cards, night club...
or something new?
I'll think about it.
I've found Elvis' new LP.
Good morning, Lolita.
Lolita, come here.
Why weren't you
at the recording?
I would've come,
had some one taken the
effort to tell me about it.
I knew it.
Ajit, she's busy entertaining tourists.
You see, she's still
under colonial rule.
Completely false.
It's like the saying-
We dare sigh...
...for fear of slander, but they
get away with murder.'
Brilliant.
OK, Shakespeare.
Ask her where she...
Hang on. Why don't I leave
and let you two fight.
Sorry, Ajit.
I'll forgive you only when
I have the whole song.
Haven't you heard?
- What?
I'm busy entertaining tourists.
Actually he's quite handsome.
Anything on?
Maybe.
Bye, Ajit.
What's up with her?
You tell me...
she was talking to you.
Come in.
Uncle, you have the blueprints
of the hospital, right?
Uncle, you have the blueprints
of the hospital, right?
Must be on my table.
Search it.
Oh, boy.
What happened?
How can you keep such
confidential papers like this?
How many times have I told you...
I need an assistant...
Heritage Hotel project. Our home?
Our home... a hotel?
See what Lolita's got me
with her first pay?
Chocolate. For me?
Can't you ever buy
something for yourself?
Silly girl.
- What if uncle finds out?
What are you looking at?
How much time do we
have to vacate?
End of November, I think.
This can't happen.
Navin uncle can't do this.
A profitless deal is a bad one.
I have to repay by 30th November.
Can I ever repay?
Tell me what do you want?
I could ask Shekhar...
but will he have 150,000...?
Here, keep the key.
Didn't you hear the horn?
I'll drop you if you're
on your way home.
A profit less deal is a bad one.
Navin Rai though a gentleman
is also a businessman.
Oh, hello. - Hello.
Did you meet him on
the way, Lolita?
Where have you been all
these days, Gurucharan?
I wanted to show you
my face only after...
...I'd organised at least
part of your money.
Money isn't going to disappear
all of a sudden, are they?
Return at your leisure.
Ridiculous. I'm your neighbour,
not a businessman.
You've retired now, relax.
Stop worrying.
We'll find some way.
Let's go, uncle.
Goodbye.
Let's go.
He's taken a load off me.
Let's all celebrate with your
aunt's spinach cutlets.
I know you love them.
I'm going to eat so much.
Raghu.
Anything else?
Just one, sir, where will Lolita and
her family go after eviction?
I mean, everything is ready
from our end... we're ready.
We're getting a house worth...
...two million for just 150,000...
...surely we can give them
10 or 20,000 as good will.
Yes, sir.
We won't throw them out.
They can stay in our old warehouse.
But that place...?
Get it cleaned, get some electricity...
they can stay...
...there for a few days.
In any case, their house is
too classy for them.
True. But won't Shekhar's presence...?
Don't worry.
Shekhar will be in Darjeeling
finalising the Tea Estate deal.
At least you can sleep peacefully now.
Otherwise we kept getting visitors.
But the debt still exists, and
we still have to pay it back.
Now you've started.
Hasn't Navin Rai just said...
Words don't mean anything.
We must repay him.
Who has that kind of money?
I have some money... and
we can sell mother's jewellery.
What? Sell sister's jewellery?
What's the matter with you?
How do I explain to you
that unless we repay him...
Don't worry daughter.
Please don't cry.
Have some faith in Navin Rai.
Hello, uncle. Hello, aunty.
Hello, Sunita.
Have a sweet. Charu's engaged.
Is it?
Why the long face?
You've to make
the arrangements, right?
Come on, we have to
select saris for the wedding.
When is it?
After the festival... on the 19th.
So soon?
I know. But the priest says
it's a very auspicious day.
Just need to exchange garlands...
You can't call that a wedding?
Exactly. It's such an auspicious day
that, that's all you need.
No, our Charu will go
amid a lot of fanfare.
Absolutely.
Let's go.
No, I have to go to Shekhar's.
I've just come from there...
he's out. Go later.
Go, it'll brighten your mood.
Guess what... yesterday Girish
was to come...
...shopping with me
...He didn't come with me...
and he never listens to me.
One second... - Yes.
Is Shekhar back? - Not yet.
Please let me know once he does.
OK.
Enter only if you're in peace.
Has the fuse blown again?
Let me show you the sari
I've picked out...
Here comes the ghost. I'm off.
There's a wedding to organise
and you're sitting
with the planchette.
Please sit, sis.
Ask something, sis.
The spirit's here already?
Ask something, sis? Come on...
I've asked.
And here's your answer...
P-R-O-B-L-E-M-S-O-L-V-E-D
Sis, consider your problem solved.
What's the problem?
Sis...?
What's up? - Nothing.
Now lets see who will solve it?
Girish.
Girish? - Girish?
Brother, you'll solve her...
yes, with a magnet.
What's this, Girish?
- Cheating. No...
I hate such pranks.
Lolita, Shekhar's back.
I have to go.
Who's this Shekhar?
How come you're here tonight?
Shekhar, please.
What happened?
I need some money.
Why ask? You have the key.
I need a bit more.
How much?
150,000 rupees.
What? Are you buying a plane?
Direct to London, huh?
Please stop joking.
I really need that much.
Why? What happened?
Shekhar... I...
Shekhar. - Yes, father.
Sidharth's coming here to
discuss your Darjeeling trip.
Come to the study.
Now.
They will lose their ancestral home
worth two million for
just 150,000?
If I could I'd give it to them
and ask them to fling
it on Navin Rai's face.
I have that much. - What?
I can give them the money.
- But why?
Sis, its just 11,252 pounds.
While we celebrate
Charu's wedding.
Imagine them on the streets
True. If you can,
please do something.
God will bless you.
I will.
But is that the only reason,
or... Lolita. Aha. Lolita.
Sis, can't you take anything
at face value?
Have you seen yours
it's bright red.
You're too much, sis.
I can't believe this, son.
Girish is making me...
...his Managing Partner
in his new project.
Managing Partner? - Yes.
And, he's given me five years'
pay in advance too.
180,000 rupees...
with no interest.
Uncle, it's your salary,
not a debt.
But son, at this age...? - What?
I'm a textile man...
You're a man of principles, uncle.
I need your values and experience.
Hear that?
OK, son. I'll accept this.
Our problems have disappeared.
Though Navin Rai is a gentleman...
Even so... a debt should be
repaid as fast as possible.
You're right, son.
I'll keep this inside.
Oh, no. No tears now.
Let's celebrate. Get dressed now.
Why?
Girish, haven't you told her?
Yeah, it's a double celebration
at Trinca's...
For Charu's wedding and...
do you have a headache today?
Come on get dressed now.
And sis, wear my heels if you like.
I'm fine in these flats.
I'm not going to fall.
Hurry up.
How will we all fit?
In a big heart.
Come on.
And Keol, try not to
mess up my shirt today.
What is this riddle called life?
Can you block it, can you
stop that which flows?
Good Morning.
Good morning. How's everything?
Your money.
Money?
The mortgage... exactly 150,000 rupees.
How did you get so much money?
Met a gentlemen just like you.
Impossible.
Did you get burnt?
You can't mortgage an
already mortgaged house.
It's not like that.
Girish... oh, you don't know him.
He's made me his Managing Partner.
Thought the least I can do
is repay your money as
I can never repay your kindness.
Please take it.
Just need your signature here.
Now if I could just have
my house papers please...
Hello, uncle. - Hello, son.
Meeting with dad?
Yes. The Goddess has
been very kind.
I've repaid my entire debt,
with interest.
Really?
The Goddess sent him from
London just to help us.
Imagine, 180,000 rupees.
See you, son.
Do come in the evening
for the prayers.
Hey, what are you doing?
Might burn your feet.
Come on, aunt... the clothes are
yours, so are the earrings...
...and now this necklace - why?
You're mine too, aren't you?
Stay away from the evil eye today...
you look beautiful.
I hope you marry a prince,
and rule where ever you go.
Let's go.
Sunita has called five times.
Now go.
Get my prince ready.
Why?
He's sulking.
Just like his father.
Says he's lost his buttons and chain.
You mean his sense of humour.
Get him ready quickly.
Just fifteen minutes left. - OK.
Just fifteen minutes left
and you're not ready yet?
Now smoke your health away.
I know what's good for me.
Why the temper? Brilliant excuse not to
show up though can't find my
buttons and chain.' So Pæÿ¿'s this?
I don't want to go.
Why?
Is this a marriage?
No conversation, no engagement
just a cold wedding invitation.
I'm not in the mood.
Weddings are dictated by an
auspicious moment... not your mood.
And they say tonight
is particularly auspicious.
Exchange garlands, and you're married.
I said I'm not going.
What's up with you?
No - what's up with all of you?
What do you mean?
You, uncle...
Why did you take money
from that stranger?
Did father ever ask for the money?
Do you know why Girish helped you?
Tell me.
To buy you.
Moulin Rouge, bailing you
out with money...
I could've helped you.
And I did ask you.
But you didn't wait.
Why did you go to him?
Where would you have
got that money from?
Why don't you understand?
I could've asked father.
And have us repay your father
with his own money?
Do you even know what he...
anyway. Thank God, it's over.
What's over?
Nothing. And...
I didn't go to Moulin Rouge.
Why?
You didn't want me to.
When did I stop you?
You were livid... kept scolding me.
Have I ever gone anywhere
without asking you?
You're always yelling at me...
Uncle and Girish made the deal,
how is it my fault?
I'm sorry.
Everyone went except me.
I'll never go.
I'm sorry.
You can have your buttons. And this...
What have you done?
Now what?
Do you know what this means tonight?
It's not a garland... it's...
Shekhar, please stop joking.
I'm not joking. You know how
auspicious tonight is, right?
Let me complete the ritual.
And with this exchange of garlands
you two are now man and wife.
Your lips intoxicate me...
...I drown in the kohl of your eyes.
Dewy morning glides your forehead...
...night resides in your tresses.
Every breath I draw for you...
...for you flutters my heart.
My life itself you win from me,
I lose, and I lose joyously.
When you touch me...
my body and heart feel adorned.
I became a married woman.
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow...
...but why it sways,
I do not know.
Repeat after me...
Where were you, sis?
Right here... inside.
She looks so pretty.
Bring the warm bread, quick.
May I serve you some?
Isn't Shekhar looking handsome today?
Girish, don't serve it cold.
Get some warm bread, man.
They know each other?
- No idea.
Cold bread is no bread.
This isn't your English bread, brother.
So what took you so long
to get here o' patriot?
I was at another wedding.
Should've told them it was
as important to come here.
But that wedding was
not possible without me.
Girish, let me serve father.
You're looking really dashing today.
Supervise the kitchen you two.
Look at Lolita... she is looking
like a bride today.
Shekhar's train leaves
at seven in the morning.
Make sure his bags are packed.
See you.
Take care of everyone
at home. - I will.
Mother and... yes... Lolita too.
Yes, yes. You take care, son.
I'll put you in jail.
Sir...
Isn't 150,000 rupees a lot for you?
- Sir?
Don't you think Girish overpaid
for a girl my son
bought with his pocket money?
Sir, please stop.
Oh. I'm not allowed?
So, what is permitted?
Shekhar buying you every day?
Or Girish, making you his life-long
mistress in one clean swoop?
You're crossing the line, sir.
I am going...
Is that a warning?
Mocking me with Girish's money?
There's a word for women
who sell themselves for money.
Don't know what you call them,
but respectable people like...
...us call them prostitutes.
Now just get out of here.
I don't want to see you or
your family's faces ever again.
...you bloody whore.
Why do I keep remembering
you so much?
That I jump off the train?
Hey, not possible.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
You know what they are saying?
Life is like a roller coaster ride.
What do you say?
I'm talking to you and
you're not even here.
I can hear the winds murmur,
they wonder where you are.
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.
I can hear the winds murmur,
They wonder where you are.
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams,
I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.
The earth looks charming
the skies don their best...
...I see our home nestled
among their breast.
But with you so far,
this dream is lonely...
...come to me now,
you're my one and only.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
I can hear the winds murmur,
they wonder where you are.
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.
Can you hear my soul chant,
Live always in my heart.
You're my bliss, you're my pain;
You're the summer in my rain.
Through the trail of our dreams,
bringing caravans of bliss...
...come to me, my darling,
come to me again.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
I can hear the winds murmur,
they wonder where you are.
Hello, sir.
Hello. Is Sidharth here?
He's waiting for you at
the tea estate. - Good.
You've been booked at the hotel.
But I'm leaving this evening.
Today?
Give me a call tomorrow.
Surprise.
Aren't you just thrilled to see me?
Hey, what are you doing?
Why is this wall being built?
Why you are cutting our tree?
And this wall?
I don't want to see their faces.
Hey, why are you cutting our tree?
Uncle, please calm down. - Why?
Koel, take him inside.
This girl has ruined everything.
What's happening to father?
Father. - Uncle?
Father. - Uncle?
Good work, Shekhar.
I'll just complete the formalities
and be with you.
I think today is a good day for me.
Great. Now I'm tired. Work ends.
Party begins.
Let's go back to the
hotel and celebrate.
I'm afraid I have to
return this evening.
What?
Have a recording tomorrow with
fifty violinists... - Are you sure?
Of course. Would I lie to you?
I'm going to check on you.
Please call home and
ask them to send a car
to the station.
You don't worry about that.
Just make great music.
I love music.
Bye.
Where's he going?
Brother, just let me get married
to him... I'll kill him.
Porter. Take this carefully.
Father?
Is everything alright at home?
Nothing is right.
Why? Is mother well?
Nobody is well. Your mother's
blood pressure has shot up.
What happened?
Mr. Gurucharan had a heart attack
and in the turmoil they...
...decided to get Girish
and Lolita married.
How's that possible?
Everything is possible today.
Everything has a price.
The price is called out and
then auctioned off.
And all sold to the highest bidder he...
And that girl...
who used to take money
from you her whole life...
To pay up the debt of her house
she took money from...
Why didn't she come to you?
Do you know why?
Because she thinks
you're not a man...
...just a good for nothing, impotent idiot,
who lives off his father.
Will you let her think that?
This wall...?
I had it made.
I don't want to see their faces.
I just can't stand them anymore.
Mother...
She's finally fallen asleep.
Are you back, son?
Look what happened in your absence.
Mom, are Lolita and Girish...?
Yes, son.
Who told you?
Vasundhara. Maybe this
is what's best.
Enough. The doctor has
asked you to rest.
There's no need to go there.
Yes, there is.
Your fees, doctor. - Thank You.
We've overcome this crisis, Girish.
But you have to take a lot of care.
I'll give you a referral.
Hello, Shekhar. You're back?
How's uncle? - Better now.
I think your decision to
go to London is right.
It's the only way.
You're taking him to London?
All of them. The situation
is delicate and...
...I can't prolong my stay anymore.
Doctor, the referral...
Excuse me.
I'll give you a letter for Dr. Caine.
Koel...
Girish, has the doctor left, son?
Yes.
Shekhar, when did you come?
Listen... - Yes...
Has he taken the morning capsule?
Yes. When is the next dose?
At night, with milk.
But the milk's over.
Don't worry, I'll get more.
Do you need anything else?
No. But tell the milkman to not
come from tomorrow. - OK.
And... the tickets aren't
here yet either.
Sir, tickets. Please sign here.
When did you return, son?
The tickets are here?
Can you believe your uncle's state? All our
hopes lie with the doctors in London now.
Are Lolita and Girish...?
Yes. Your uncle wished it.
And men like Girish are rare.
Mother, please come here.
Coming.
Shekhar. Shekhar.
Thank God, you're here.
Everything will be fine now.
Right?
I can't believe you sold out like this.
Shekhar. - Oh, please.
Women like you...
What do 'respectable' people
like you call us?
Prostitutes, right?
Whores.
Your father's words, not yours.
And you're just like him.
If you ever utter a word against him...
...I'll kill you... you...
Night, o' ambassador of black.
Night, o' envoy of dark.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
An era has passed since
we met last, and yet,
you come alone?
The mood is solemn...
...only the crickets mourn.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon;
why do you come alone?
Extinguish the twilight,
eclipse the dark...
...I only wish to speak
to the pitch in the black.
The night is sad...
...it's heavy with grief...
...sitting in its own dark shadow.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
An era has passed since we met last,
and yet, you come alone?
Extinguish the twilight,
eclipse the dark...
...I only wish to speak
to the pitch in the black.
You're here?
We're leaving tonight...
You have no business
with anyone here.
Please give this key to Shekhar.
Brother... Shekhar.
Shekhar. Koel. - Enough. Leave.
You've got your hands
on a treasure chest...
...what do you need this key for?
The darkness is maddening,
opaque and dense.
It pricks, it stings;
it's a welcome offence.
I seek its lap
to end my day...
...I join its embrace
to veil my dismay.
Like my black renegade kohl,
it streams down my face.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon,
why do you come alone?
Extinguish the twilight,
eclipse the dark...
...I only wish to speak
to the pitch in the black.
The night is sad...
...it's heavy with grief...
- Let's go, Lolita.
...sitting in its own dark shadow.
Not a musician...
Just a businessman.
Uncle Raghu...
Son. - Yes, mother.
Some bad news...
Mr. Gurucharan is no more.
The wedding happened quickly
to fulfil his last wish.
Is it over?
Yes. Girish managed everything.
They'll be here next week
for the last rites.
What's happening to you, son?
Is everything okay?
Tell Mr. Tantiya I'm ready to
marry his daughter Gayatri.
Wonderful, son. I'll call them
first thing tomorrow morning.
Come on, Rajeshwari.
Have you composed this?
No. It's Tagore's, stupid.
Hello, Shekhar. Congratulations.
Here to just congratulate me?
I'm also here to give you
a parcel from Lolita.
What's this?
The papers to their house.
Why are you giving it to me?
Consider it your wedding gift.
Tell her I don't want her charity.
Not charity - a debt.
She said she'll never be able
to pay you back completely.
...but she's trying.
Your wife's become pretty smart.
Yes. And I really love her.
Isn't this the tune you two sang?
Day and night.
It made me insanely jealous
as to how someone
could love so much.
But marriage cured me.
My clever wife cured me my Koel.
Koel?
I know what you're thinking,
and rightly so.
I loved Lolita very much...
but when I proposed to her
...she said she was already married.
I asked her but she didn't tell
me her husband's name.
...But she never so miserable
...not even to Koel.
But when she gave you
the house, I knew.
The money you had given her
turned into a debt the day you...
...decided to marry Gayatri.
This debt will become a burden for her.
And she won't bear this burden...
A burden she wasn't willing to carry.
That's who she is.
I wanted to find that foolish man
and drag him to her feet.
But you... you're not even worthy
of her feet. I pity you, Shekhar.
You lost what was already yours.
You're the most unfortunate soul
in the world.
When are you all leaving?
- Right now.
What have I done?
What do I do...?
Shekhar.
Ask daddy dearest.
Why was Girish here?
What is this?
The papers of the house.
He was here to make this deal?
How much does he want?
Mr. Tantiya will be delighted.
Hello? Mr. Tantiya, please?
Good news, Mr. Tantiya...
we've got the house.
We're just leaving for your house.
My son has accomplished
what I couldn't.
Behold. Mr. Gurucharan's house papers.
Thank God, it's yours now.
Or else God knows how many more
lives would've been destroyed.
The house that killed Mr. Gurucharan
got Lolita...
...fired with such indignity created
a wall between two families...
Rajeshwari. Be quiet.
Thank God, it's yours now.
What is so wrong?
He couldn't repay so I kept the house.
You gave him the money
knowing fully well he'd...
...never be able to repay.
It's business.
And I'm a businessman.
A very bad one.
Such a profitless deal.
Why? What's the price?
It's free... but too expensive for you.
You've got everything.
...an empire, fame...
and now this house too.
But nobody is poorer than you today...
...because you got the house...
...but you've lost your son.
You've gone mad.
You're going to be wed in a while.
Mr. Tantiya is expecting us...
...Ask him... will he wed his
daughter to a married man?
What? - Yes.
I'm already married.
To whom?
Lolita.
Really, son? When?
I don't consider it a marriage.
Give her some money and...
Enough. My wife is not for sale.
Your mind is governed only
by money, isn't it, dad?
And I feel sorry that
I was following your path.
You poisoned my mind so deeply;
I saw everything through your eyes.
I was reduced to business, deals,
money just like you...
I even raised my hand on my wife.
Stop it, son.
Where are you going?
To be a good husband
and bring my wife home.
You won't go anywhere.
Where are you going, son?
What's overcome him?
Shekhar.
Shekhar.
Shekhar.
Break it, Shekhar.
Break it.
Ajit, stop him.
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
Break it, damn it.
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
Stop watching the circus and
stop him. Call the police.
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
What is this commotion?
- I'll check.
Rajeshwari.
Break it, son. Destroy it forever.
Here, light these.
Light up the whole house.
My daughter-in-law is home.
Yes, tonight is Shekhar's wedding night.
Just a few players have changed.
And the city's dreams and
joys have returned.
Calcutta is once again a city of joy.
