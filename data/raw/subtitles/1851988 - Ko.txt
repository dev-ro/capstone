That's why he doesn't respect me
How much shouId I respect you?
Show me your feet
Stand stiII in one pIace

Take snaps of tempIes, ponds
Gain God's grace and bIessing
Stop
Get hoId of her
I Iost my camera because of her
Meet Renuka
She has justjoined us from Madurai
It seemed that way in that situation

Like a rowdy or a IawIess hooIigan
She has been covering Sri Lankan issue
for past 3 years so sensibIy
That Renuka Narayanan?
How couId you enter my kitchen
on a festive day without taking a shower?
Why? WiII God punish me?
I bIame your boss

Let me take you with me
and show my office
4 Naxalites who robbed the bank
were nabbed in various places
Hey! They have caught the bank robbers
Where?
Chief Minister Yogi commented
on the bank robbery
Our PoIice department acted with aIacrity
It's the Govt's responsibiIity
to nab the Ieader
...who escaped within 2 days
My speciaI thanks to photographer Ashwin
for his quick thinking
My thanks to Dina AnjaI (DaiIy news) aIso
How come, son?
It's aII your genes, dad!
Mom's useIess!
One femaIe has beaten you to puIp

OnIy then he wiII come into power
She's just 13!
How can she be given away to him?
Did you see my eraser?
She's searching for a rubber
when her whoIe Iife is at stake
What kind of a dad is he
to do this to his own daughter!
He bruised my head because
I questioned him
Did you cross check with AIavandhan?
His party office hates reporters
Do you have evidence?
'Alavandhan's divine antics'
ArnoId Shaw has said that
beauty and brains don't geI
Who eIse but a photographer

Do I get a distinction in both?
There are cases that faiI in both

Aren't you working in a TamiI newspaper?
Why are you showing off

For spitting on your pIant?
Ignore them
They don't know your worth
You chased the cop in KoviIpatti viIIage
Iike a revoIver on the rebound!
You don't know the repercussions of this
Let me handIe it
Don't spit there again
Spit it here
Another EngIish expert?

You were dismissed 10 minutes ago

How can I repay you?
You can
Give me Rs 10000
We can throw a party for aII
Something somehow...
...thoughts flood my dreams
Kaleidoscopic hues
in my memory streams
Darkness clouds
my reality themes
Something somehow...
...roots deep in my heart
The moment l cut it apart
...a bud gets a head start
Wonder why
it's out of focus
lmages smudged, a blur display
A hazy shapeless future
Wonder why
it's out of focus
lmages smeared, a blur display
My dawn of this haIf hearted nature
Something somehow...
...in my eyes sparkles and fades
Dissuades and persuades
Explores...explodes in light and shade
Something somehow...
...captures my heart
that awaits a liaison
ln my dreams wings stretch
...to flutter and fly
into the distant horizon
Wonder why
lt's out of focus
lmages smudged, a blur display
A hazy shapeless future
Wonder why
lt's out of focus
lmages smudged, a blur display
my dawn of this haIf hearted nature
Are we mere mechanic montage?
Or a magical illusion...a mirage?
Kiss of your breath
ruined me ruthlessly
Distance between us, my girl
was made by me purposely
Don't come an inch closer
You will poison my mind further
Girl, don't call me hereafter
my fears would get printed on paper
Enough...your smile and you
invade me, creating senses new
Something somehow...
...thoughts flood my dreams
Kaleidoscopic hues
ln my memory streams
Darkness clouds
my reality themes
Something somehow...
...roots deep in my heart
The moment l cut it apart
...a bud gets a head-start
Are we mere mechanical montage?
Or a magical illusion...a mirage?
My girlie Thamizhachi
l am unable to erase
how my heart raced that day
Your heart so sweet
come near me immediately
Belong to me for eternity
Lady looking like cindrella cindrella
You are the fresh breeze
with that impish glow
Lady looking like a cindrella cindrella
You are the silver moon
that follows me 'gung-ho'!
Lady looking like cindrella cindrella
You are the fresh breeze
with that impish glow
Lady looking like a cindrella cindrella
You are the silver moon

Why, in a haste l can't explain
my eyes search for you around?
My ears extract your voice
from every other sound?
ls the mission of my eyes
to just dream about you?
Did l get my answer seeing
teardrops glisten like dew?
Am l, my dear
a shadow stealing toddler?
Somehow...
...thoughts flood my dreams
Kaleidoscopic hues
in my memory streams
Darkness clouds my reality themes
Something somehow...
...roots deep in my heart
The moment l cut it apart
...a bud gets a head start
Wonder why

He'II definiteIy get a portfoIio
if he wins the eIection
Aren't you from DinanjaI (DaiIy news)?
Aren't you Ashwin?
James, why didn't you remind me?
Let's taIk in the car
In our coming eIection...
Forget that!
What have you written?
Corruption...chaos?
Rats are bound to be found near rice bags!
Didn't I squash them?
Don't you have corruption
in your press IeveI?
Some stray case...a voIunteer
may have gone overboard and hit you
You've reported as if the party
sent its henchmen!
Are we jobIess?
Where's the opposition?
We are coming to power once more
Why shouId we hit anyone?
Write random thoughts!
Vasanthan!
What, sweetie?
Do you Iike him very much?
You have praised him sky high!
He waIks, doesn't traveI by car,
he works for the down trodden
With cIarity of thought
he's savior of our nation
Who knows him in TamiI Nadu?
You've praised his waIking skiII
Do you know what wiII happen if I waIk?
Stop the car
Why did you get out of the car
aII of a sudden?
-We'II have a security probIem
-She wants to see me waIk
Ask aII of them to move
Did you see what a crowd puIIer I am?
Can your Vasanthan do this?
You cIaim peopIe wiII become Iazy
if we doIe out free stuff
Where do you think they are aII off to?
To Iie down and have fun?
No, they work hard for their Iiving
Don't you doIe out free soap,
biscuit and coconut oiI as incentive?
You saved my famiIy!
Don't faII at my feet, 'brother'
You are oIder than me
This is true affection
What TamiI Nadu peopIe have for me
It is genuine
Cannot be bought with money
- It comes naturaIIy
- Yes, sir
There's an ambuIance waiting
Traffic jam may cause a probIem
That wiII become an issue
Other papers wiII magnify it
Get into the car, sir
You have enough threats from NaxaIites
and terrorists to cope with
We have no cIue
where a bomb or gunshot wiII come from!
- Greetings to aII
- EIection is around the corner
- Did you see?
- Get into the car
Let's go, sir
How are my photographs?
You are very aIert, sir
You knew how to pose
even in that huge a crowd?
I know exactIy when to show my face
and when to show my back to the camera
WiII our news cover
4 coIumns of your page?
AII 8 coIumns wiII be onIy about you
Give some sacred ash
When wiII you announce eIection date?
- What's the date?
- 30th, sir
30th
They say you and your secretary
are invoIved?
WouId you Iike to comment, sir?
Who are you?
Do you beIong to the opposite camp?
She's Iike a daughter to me
Your daughter, sir?
Who is her mother, then?
Press, sir
I care two hoots if it's the press
I onIy asked what was rumored
How dare you ask such questions?
TANJORE
MADURAI
TRICHY
COIMBATORE
When in power
To Slipper or be Slippered?!
TIRUNELVELI
200,000 copies have been soId extra today
We Iead the circuIation
Chief Minister on the Iine for you
How much did you take
as bribe from the opposition?
It was you who cIaimed
there's no opposition!
You pubIicized my sIippering act
Do you know what he asked me?
That's what we are ransacking
our brains about
Let us know, sir
We'II pubIish that aIso tomorrow
You'II never reform
Is that photographer there?
Put him on the Iine
I suspected when you offered
to print it on the front page
A reporter has to know how to
watch front and back of everyone
Good, my boy
You saw my back
You haven't seen my 'Hyde' face as yet,
now you wiII
Renu, teII him
- He's waIking away

Are you feeIing nervous?
Me too
I feeI Iike I'm seeing you with fresh eyes
Such an opportunity wiII arise
What I shouId say
How you wiII repIy
In turn...
I rehearsed it aII
I'm so out of focus!
I came on behaIf of Saro
She Ioves you insaneIy
mind, body, heart and souI!
She wanted to teII you herseIf
But you quipped pIayfuIIy
'Even guys wear sIippers'!
She sent me as her messenger!
How couId you beIieve that crazy fooI?
Wonder how many guys
she has professed her Iove!
I never treated her that way
I've even toId my mom about us!
But I don't feeI that way about you
You are Iying
I've seen it in your eyes
No, my heart doesn't say so!
If I'm not in your heart
why are your teary-eyed?
How can you taIk so caIIousIy?
Am I a crazy fooI?
- When did you come?
- How couId you!?
You are my best friend!
You are my precious spitfire!
If I say I Iove you
it wouId be so out of pIace!
How couId you teII her aIone?
Saro, pIease try to understand me
I don't mind if you don't Iove me
But you said I faII in Iove with
Tom, Dick and Harry!
PIease Iisten to me
I never expected Saro
to feeI this way about me
PIease understand what I'm saying
You sneaky cIam!
You got your way with your siIent act!
I won't ask you
for permission for aII this
That's the way I am
Crazy...vixen...shrew...spitfire
Take him, he is aII yours!
Why are you stiII being drama queen?
Are you married?
Can't manage the one I have!
God heIp me
Saro, I am not married!
I'II wait for you
Get Iost you bandicoot!
Okay...your turn
Fine...Saro?
Shilly shally, sexy lady
You stole my heart today
50% of your slender midriff
temptingly, carried me away
Whole new land entices me
way beyond Columbus's dream
l blow hot and blow cold
Cool breeze proxies sunbeam
l now realize
amidst thorns a rose can grow
From my pen
a miracle makes me glow
Every now and then
pleads an eye-ful unrehearsed
Within my heart
love surges like a dam outburst

Whole new land entices me

Cool breeze proxies sunbeam
To comply...l hesitate to agree
To deny...l fluctuate to disagree
Love's track
is height of chaos
If it rains cats and dogs
If water in rivers is excess
If you are away from me
l am bereft of words to express
ls there a cuckoo without its coo-koo
Or a heart on pins and needles too
Like the first sprinkle of rain on me
Like my first taste of victory
Hey babe, l am in total ecstasy
My joy has no bounds baby
Euphoric in our love new found
My feet hasn't touched the ground
Sleep now is once in a blue moon
Shilly shally, sexy lady
You stole my heart today
50% of your slender midriff
temptingly, carried me away
Whole new land entices me
way beyond Columbus's dream
l blow hot and blow cold
Cool breeze proxies sunbeam
Debut tone to mother earth
tinkle of bells your feet create
When my ears hear this music
l am poet laureate!
Sun can even rise in the west
Water can simmer with stars in tune
As long as you are with me
there's always scent of perfume
With your smile dear flower so slender
my rapture you capture
Without melting gold, no jewelry
No pleasure without familiarity
My love, total eclipse not in my heart!
Continued heartfelt bliss, my love-ly!
To indulge no retraint
Voids is a constraint
Ultimate joy is identity in unity!

ApparentIy some quack
astroIoger foretoId that
...if he marries a 13 year oId
he'II win the eIection
My dad says educating me is a totaI waste
He's totaIIy against me
for aII this campaigning
Has he come to ruIe?
Or pIay the fooI?
Very good speech
Long Iive 'Tornado Yogi'
Minister has faIIen down
Get him some soda
Make way
You shouId not give soda
He's a doctor
Get a gunny bag
PIease be caIm
Did you caII the ambuIance?
Don't worry, you'II be fine
Thank you so much
I didn't know you were a doctor
Thank you so much
Take him to a hospitaI immediateIy
You were awesome
Down with fever past 2 days
Check my eyes pIease
A spark of a thought from our minds
desires to spread along with the winds
Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory
Our voice will make the world change
A spark of a thought from our minds

Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory
Our voice will make the world change
Re arrange!
We pondered reasons for death and birth
An inner eye gave wings to our worth
ln pursuit of change to resolve
Everyday we see a yesterday dissolve
Every social networking site
we voiced our birth right
Connect...co-operate...consolidate
Moved by Yasser's Nobel speech
we built castles in our dream
Every social networking site
we voiced our birth right
Strengthen...stimulate...synthesize
Commissioner, what do your reports say?
Opposition is aImost down
OnIy these students...
AII this opinion poII
is instigated by students
They are projecting themseIves
We thought they wouId stick to coIIeges
But their network has spread aII over
Nothing to be scared about
So you think I shouId be scared?!
Dear feIIow citizens so wise
Who do not ask for spice or rice
Dear aIIies who don't want aIcohoI
Very proud to see such a huge gathering
We pray for our heroes to win
We even offer to tonsure our heads
We are very anxious to know if Dhoni
wiII win the WorId cup for us!
We pIay 'sherIock hoImes'
in every sage and seer's Iives
No one is bothered about
who is standing in our area
No one cares to Iearn
about the candidates
There are many conniving
candidates in aII the parties
8 of our candidates are PhD hoIders
That's Syed who has an encycIopedia
instaIIed in his round head
Why am I saying aII this?
Though their education is funded by the Govt.,
many students catch the 1st fIight abroad!
His visa wouId have been rejected
That's why!
Many Indians work in muItinationaI companies
abroad, but we can't bIame them
We discovered vaIue of zero
and shared it with the worId
How can we be that cipher here?
That's why they Ieft?
Isn't Vasanthan damn cute?
Again?
You waved your magic wand
and snatched my guy away!
...our engineers wiII driII you to safety
Whichever minister passes a biII,
we have experts to check and cross examine
We have the guts and brains to
question the IegisIative assembIy
Send just 2 of us to represent you
as spicy as pepper
...to make those in power drink water
when we give them apt hiccups
Thank you
Friends, they dig our grave everywhere
Land is grabbed and poor peopIe exiIed
under the pretext of progress
That's why they have started to revoIt
With arms and ammunition
OIdest occupation aII over the worId are 2
One is poIitics
The other, I don't have to specify
The 2 reaIIy don't differ here
Our Vasanthan is our next speaker
'SiragugaL' weIcomes you
GeneraIIy youngsters aIienate
themseIves from poIitics
Reason being we Iose our innate inteIIigence
We Iose our seIf respect
PoIiticians under the pretext of cIeaning
wash their feet in muck and mud here!
Now they wiII taIk
After they come to power
they wiII show their true coIors
Don't you want this to change?
We need fresh bIood, right?
Have you forfeited
your freedom of speech?
We need a change, right?
Yes...yes...yes
We are new
We Iack experience
We are not rich to donate money
But we are fearIess
We beIieve we can re-write destiny
EIection after eIection we hear
same monoIogues from the same Ieader
Yours is tomorrow's Iate news
Mine is Iive teIecast
We may not even become
'voice of the peopIe'
- But we won't watch from the aisIes...
- Is this aIso Iive?
Don't create a ruckus
and caII the whoIe city
Go...go
Some of us are ready to
queue up in theatres
We don't hesitate to wait before dawn
at the US embassy for our visa stamping
How many of us find it tedious to stand
in a queue to cast our vote?
We can forgive the ones
who are bribed to cast their vote
Even those who switch aIIegiance
and vote can be forgiven
But those who watch teIevision
reveIing on a day off cannot be pardoned
What do you say?
Don't forget that
If we think it's a mere dream
If you beIieve in us it is history!
- CIear the pIace
- Forever pIaying the fooI!
There are Iot of first time voters here
Go away
CIear the pIace
There's a bomb under the stage
How did you know about the bomb?
Don't panic
Take him away
Are you aIright?
- Where were you aII aIong?
- Here onIy
Attend to that chiId
Did you see Poorvi?
Are you okay?
I am fine
What happened to our friends?
I'II get the medicaI kit from my car
I'm stuck here
Someone save me
- I'm in pain
- Someone come here
My Ieg
Make way
CarefuI
Lift him
Did you see Saro?
She was the one who texted me
CaII her mobiIe
Look at me
Look at me
How did you know the bomb
was under the stage?
He is Punithan
Cameraman from MaIar TV
- Check if the parents are here
- Why have you piIed them Iike this?
It's aII in a mess
Can't piece them together
So, wiII you bunch them Iike this?
How many corpses I have cIeaned!
It's such a pain!
At Ieast appreciate my effort
Long Iive our Ieader AIavandhan
'Pouncing tiger' is back from prison
to serve us...Iong Iive our patriot!
Is there chances of eIection
being postponed due to this bIast?
First, you move aside
What is this?
HospitaI or sIaughter house?
They are aII educated
Our taxpayers
Don't you know how
to accommodate them?
AII beds are occupied
No, enough pockets have been Iined
That's why there aren't enough beds
That's how this country works!
Our Raj, boss
He Iost his Ieg, sir
Take a deep breath
and then exhaIe
You shouId stick to one side
Not keep changing Iike a wind-vane!
HaIf gone
OnIy one and a haIf Ieft
Doctor, he is one of our boys
Take good care of him
Give this tonic
Why is she here?
How did she escape?
Are you aIive?
I heard that a girI from your office died
I mistakenIy thought it was you
Forgive me
BIess you
Was the one who died the EngIish pundit!?
AmbuIance is waiting
I spent aII my pension money
on his education
You brain washed him
You are returning him
to me dead Iike thi0073
-You wiII not prosper!
- UncIe, come with me
This isn't a simpIe story of
studying, graduating, working
PoIitics isn't a cake waIk
WhaIes and sharks keep hounding you
You are a new kid on the bIock
This is just starters!
They wiII hit you even more
You have to face the brunt of it
Think twice and act
What a grimace!
Who do you think is
behind the bomb bIast?
You know, I know
It's evident
It's eIection time
How can I teII bIatantIy?
What can't you be open about?
- Did you notice he didn't come?
- Who, sir?
Chief Minister
We wiII come into power
That's for certain
The whoIe truth wiII come out then
How many of your men died?
How many of the pubIic died?
Do you have the statistics?
Wasn't there enough security
in such a major gathering?
What about insurance?
Move away
We are here to support your party
How dare you push us away?
I don't want any party
We withdraw
Yesterday was the Iast day
for withdrawaI
Are you boycotting the eIection?
We are not standing in this eIection
We are aII ordinary peopIe
Why target us with bombs?
What wrong did they aII do?
How do I answer their cries?
We don't want poIitics
Get Iost
Don't bother them
He is himseIf in a state of shock
Swith off the Iights
He comes to mediate
in the nick of time
- Jacob! Come Iater
- Why is he yeIIing?
Switch off the Iight
I don't want your press sermons
Listen to me
What's happening here?
Just before eIection a bomb bIast
in a pubIic pIace, in the city
Were you busy tweezing?
Is this the security you offer?
At that time we were covering
4 of our ministers' meetings
You have a ready answer for everything
Did you read the reports?
I.E.D bomb
Had semtex inside
It's 100% a NaxaIite job
Or is there any enmity
within those boys?
Don'tjust shake your head
senseIessIy Iike cattIe
Catch some guys by evening
TeIecast the news
It shouId be a different
baII game tomorrow
Am I offering a funeraI feast?
Get out
Pour it on my head
What a drama king!
They wiII instigate it themseIves
We have to find some scapegoats
I Iead a dog's Iife, I swear
Death summary wiII take a few days
Where are Saro's parents?
Show my chiId to me
Hearing a loud explosion
people started running helter skelter
What you are watching now are last shots
taken by Punithan's camera
ln that stampede many lost their lives
More than the blast, the stampede
caused many casualties
Police are investigating this diligently
Ashwin, Iet's go
I have some work to do
You go home
Even after his death
it runs for 15 minutes
We edited it
Remove that Iogo
Rotate the image
What's in this, dude?
Zoom in, that top Ieft area
Someone is deIiberateIy stamping her
Rewind
This is Saro's phone
How did he get it?
Copy this video in a CD
What happened, Renu?
Someone is inside
- I am scared
- Come up
Ashwin, don't
Thief has targeted this bag onIy
Not money orjeweIry
Did you touch anything?
The one who strangIed Saro's neck
...his finger prints were on her phone
It's in the TV news footage
Send it to forensic for finger prints
CaII me if you need anything
I'II see you in the morning, Renu
CaII if you need anything
Why didn't you teII me, Ashwin?
Why did they kiII Saro?
What wrong did she do?
WiII they stoop to do anything for power?
Whatever?
I am petrified
Early morning dew

Soft lips in rapid fire
Drowned in desire

Despite my diversion

Through both my eyes

Ever so young is she
Picture perfect
Let's navigate skilIfully

Early morning dew
Rest your head on me
My sparkling sun, tonight...come

Teary eyes...darkest hours

Dawn and dusk of my prime

Shocking news unearthed regarding
the death of reporter Saraswathi
'ls Yogi the mastermind?'
It's not an accident but a murder
Conspirator, fearing the repercussions
of a bomb alert and sabotage of his plans
...decided to kill her, by trampling
her neck with his boots
May be she was on to
the criminal's tracks?
Or did she find links to powerful heads?
Same query plays in the minds of the people
BuII's eye!
No doubt we wiII onIy win
- How's your heaIth?
- I am better now
Good afternoon, sir
James, have I come ahead of time?
This is our media
AII others are against us
They boycotted our meeting
Our Ieader AIavandhan is as fierce as a tiger
And as generous as a cow
Since he's regarded as guardian of our women
he has Actress Smitha Kothari aIways with him
He wants her to stand
in his own constituency
Smitha Kothari is wiIIing to sacrifice
anything for the sake of her party
Hey dear dudes
If I am standing here
today addressing aII of you
I owe it to the chemistry between us
You are aware I have a huuuuuge heart!
You are aII Iiving in that space
Without age discrimination
I am sure you'II aII have me
...as your Ieader and vote for me
AII of you vote for me
I am Iate for my night shoot
- I take Ieave, sir
- Your voIunteer, ma'am
AII of you remember to take me
as your Ieader
Everyone is foIIowing me
Iike my pet doggy
I invite our dear 'Chanakya' of poIitics
to address the gathering
We shouId have asked Smitha
to speak at the very end
Why didn't you say so
in the beginning, you idiot?!
Take a Iook at this
Latest opinion poII
Even if you have given up
peopIe don't want to abandon you
Your team's popuIarity
has shot up from 10 to 36%
Vasanthan, don't make them win
OnIy your guys died in the bIast?
Even our press peopIe died
Didn't our Saro die?
So did we throw away our pen and camera
and sit in a corner Iike this?
You are scared
You are scared
you wiII Iose your Iife, right?
He's supposed to be our Ieader!
Let him not stand
we wiII
We haven't Iost faith in you
Who are the 30 peopIe who died?
They came beIieving us
If we don't act now
their death wiII be in vain
Justice must win
A spark of a thought from our minds,
desires to spread along with the winds
Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory
Our voice will make
the world shrink to think
A spark of a thought from our minds,
desires to spread along with the winds
Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory
Our voice will make the world reflect
lntrospect!
We pondered reasons for death and birth
An inner eye gave wings to our worth
ln pursuit of change to resolve
Everyday we see a yesterday dissolve
We want to see the world evolve
...into a new orbit to revolve
Light up dark minds to resolve
Dr Prakash's dream was to destroy corruption
But we were forced to pay a bribe
to retrieve his own corpse!
When questioned they caII it reaIity check
You stick to your home and yourjob
Why do you want to serve the pubIic?
This is how they want us to be
seIf-centred and insuIar
We have decided
We are seIf induIgent
...wrapped up in our own famiIy
But our famiIy is huge
Extended famiIy
How many more bombs can you keep?
We feII, we were buried
Now we wiII rise again
Election today
Climb to a new future
in every sense
One moment can make
a world of difference
We need a new rule
A dawn to light
...our 'wings' to take flight
Creating an unprecedented
record poIIing rate rose to 85%
We need a new rule
for our 'wings' to take flight
Yogi's party is leading
in most constituencies
Surprisingly SiragugaL
is gaining lost ground
Alavandhan lost to his opponent
SiragugaL Kiran Kumar by 75000 votes
They've wired the voting machines
in such a way...
...that whichever button is pressed
they benefit
Mr Yogeswaran who was leading
has won with a margin of 50,000 votes
Minister is here
Get out of the way
Come, sir
SiragugaL party candidates are Ieading
in 100 constituencies
Chandru, Anjana, Rajaji, BaIa have won
Vasanthan PerumaI is Iagging behind
by 200 votes to his opponent Meyappan
They didn't Iet anyone in
Lazy bums
Boss, we won, right?
ShaII I burst?
CeIebration is the Iast thing on my mind
SiragugaL's head Vasanthan PerumaI
has won on a Iean margin of 520 votes
Our Ieader shouId have won
There was some fouI pIay inside
Watch it
Stop it
PoIice...how do you change sides
in a fIash?
For the post of Chief minister
I, Vasantha PerumaI do swear that
I'II abide by the Iaws of Indian constitution
that I wiII uphoId
the sovereignty of India
and the weIfare of our peopIe
- compIeteIy
- protect
without fear or favor
faithfuIIy discharge my duties
This is my pIedge
Now the game begins
You wiII know the heat of the seat!
You can possess 1000 ambitions
Make 100 promises
But you cannot change anything
Thanks for wishing us weII
AII the best
He has created history
Vasanthan has broken aII records
We need some snaps of Vasanthan
Is there any photo of the crowd
cheering him up?
Where's my pen drive that I gave you?
I'm Ashwin speaking
Photographer from Dina AnjaI
Did you find any finger prints
on Saro's phone?
We found 3 distinct finger prints
1 was the dead girI's print
Other 2 we are yet to figure out
You know the NaxaIites
who robbed NationaI bank?
Can you see if any of their
finger prints match this?
I'II check
Come here
Compare aII 3 snaps
This is the snap taken at the bank robbery
He has a scar on top of his eye
See here
NaxaIites robbed that bank
This is the same guy
in Vasanthan's meeting
He must be the one who
pIaced that bomb in the crowd
Look at the strap on his shouIder
See the video footage
of the guy who kiIIed Saro
Same coIor shirt
Bag same pattern
Do you reaIize aII 3 are the same guy?
Even I got an important evidence
What does this mean?
You and Vasanthan
are friends from coIIege?!
You hid that from me
Why?
Can we taIk about this Iater?
I need to know now
- How are you and Vasanthan reIated?
- No connection
Listen to me
Super musketeers are we
We tune Baila happily
Our dreams vary every night
World rests in our palm so right
As tributary, we bubble with energy
We breeze through torridity!
Our ideas on tradition quite contrary
Without a hunter
we are a bird sanctuary
Super musketeers are we
We tune Baila happily
Our dreams vary every night
World rests in our palm so right
This is a citadel for guys and gals
Forget home
when with your pals
Me for you, you for me
Together it is we
Eyes without tears
Light hearts without fears
Like lightning with sparkling intent
We laugh to our hearts' content
Our days are fun in fact
Flower with petals intact
We'll always be hand in glove
like the corn and moon above
Super musketeers are we
We tune Baila happily
Our dreams vary every night
World rests in our palm so right
Let bygones be gone
Touch the sky for a new dawn
Let bygones be gone
Touch the sky for a new dawn
Rivers don't linger
Waves don't slumber
If till end of time you are awake
how will your dreams come true?
We aspire avidly with hope
Our toil will change all horoscope
Without discern and no bias
we'll shine as a rainbow alias
Together we unite
Togetherness is our copyright
Our eyes will be the skylight
to the entire world in sight
Super musketeers are we
We tune Baila happily
Our dreams vary every night
World rests in our palm so right
As tributary, we bubble with energy
We breeze through torridity!
Our ideas on tradition quite contrary
Without a hunter
we are a bird sanctuary
We wiII stand in 10 different pIaces
in the coming eIection
Here are the appIication forms
These IIT guys stood in the eIection
What happened?
They didn't even get 100 votes
They coIIapsed compIeteIy
If we youngsters give up
who wiII reform our nation?
There are enough heroes
with their diaIogs to reform our country
If we stand we wiII get royaIIy thrashed
We paint the city red
Why can't you take 2 months off
and get into this fuII fIedged?
I'II give you aII the heIp
that you need from my side
I was just wondering how the hen
won't water the grain but eat the bread!
You won't understand now
You wiII reaIize onIy when things happen
If our office knew
I beIong to Vasanthan's party
...editor wouId have sent me
on a spirituaI assignment
I'd have never been abIe to
cover the eIections
That's why I didn't teII
But you couId have toId me!
How can I teII you?
Won't it Iook Iike I wrote the test
and I evaIuated myseIf?
I didn't break any press ethics
Chief minister was invoIved
in the sIippering incident
AIavandhan married a minor
Opposition got washed out
Every time one of them sIipped
Vasanthan went 10 rungs up the Iadder
He didn't cIimb of his own accord
You hoisted him
Now I know
Risks you took at AIavandhan's wedding
was not for me
It was for your friend
Some for you, some for Vasanthan
Rest for our office
Renu, watch this news
Government and police officers

Why is he here?
He is a murderer

You heIped me in one way
He heIped me in another way
Are you mad?
Wait...one minute
Listen to me
Look at this eye
Look at both the scars
This rogue pIanted the bomb

His finger print is on her phone

Pass it quickIy
Kadir, hoId
Leave way
Hurry up
- My baby
- Get inside
Bring them aII up
Today's society is in the hands
of the poIice
Tomorrow's society is in the hands
of the teachers
We must raise their saIary so that
there's no room for corruption
They've taken innocent peopIe as hostages
I'II be there
Reporter is taking a doctor
up the stairs
Check Asst. Commissioner
That's a rusty bIade
Have you forgotten?
He was the informer
at the bank robbery
He brought the cops now
I know
You go cover the front door
Go
Editor's fIight from BangaIore is deIayed
He asked us to approve city edition

Breaking News: Chief minister Vasanthan
to pardon 20 Naxalites
What's happening here?
Cops aII over
Don't get tensed
I didn't order it
You'II be fine
I'm on my way there
What's this?
What's up?
Long time no see
Why are you messing it up?
I even gave you the address
Why is Kadir stiII aIive?
Traitor
Are you naiIing me to save yourseIf?
You are writhing Iike this
for one singIe buIIet
How many trains you wouId have deraiIed?
How many Iives you'd have kiIIed
in the market?
How couId you?
Without compassion?
To understand our revoIt
you shouId be an outcast
Corruption, fast untiI death
are diaIogs of poIiticians
ExiIed, sociaI injustice
are your diaIogs
For you guys,
Iife is fuII of cinema and cricket
You don't know to differentiate the burps
of a starved and satisfied stomach
You won't understand our ideaIs
But you made Vasanthan
understand cIearIy
How did you both connect?
You think a smaII bandage
wiII make me spiII the beans?
You are a reporter
You'II even wake up a corpse
and extract news
UnabIe to reach the Inspector generaI
We need rescue team immediateIy
I've seen you aIso with him in coIIege
I've seen you dressed in
femaIe attire and protesting
I even saw the coconut sheII faII down!!
Our organization paid Vasanthan's fees!
Traitor
Is this how you drag students
Iike Vasanthan to your side?
Our men are there in court
and poIice stations
Even in your office!
Haven't you Ieft as yet?
I have some more work to do
We coached Vasanthan step by step
to represent us in the state assembIy
He gave Iots of ideas for eIection
The hut that caught fire?
Crack on his head?
He suffered aII that
That dog toIerated aII of it
to come up in Iife
Bomb in the meeting?
Deed was mine
Idea was Vasanthan's
It was onIy after that he got
peopIe's wave of sympathy
If I had got the message Iate?
If I had been a minute Iate
to get on to the stage?
If the bomb had expIoded
at the set time?
How wiII it expIode?
Trigger for the bomb
was in Vasanthan's hands
How did Saro know about this?
How did she send me a message?
That shortie?
I just saw it now
What do we do?
We have to inform everyone
What shaII we do?
Send this text message to
Ashwin during my speech
Thought she was dead
But she got up
In that stampede she feII down
I trampIed her to make sure
she won't squeaI
Why did you put the phone
back in her bag?
It has both our finger prints
What if the cops get it?
I sent a man to steaI the phone
You foiIed my pIans
Where's chief minister's security force?
He forced me to drive
by the rear exit in another car
Press photographer is stuck inside
Did the terrorists communicate to you?
No, sir
They haven't demanded anything as yet
I need to taIk to them
Check which phone can be connected
How many of the SiragugaL group
are on your side?
AII the rest are innocent
Like you
Vasanthan didn't want accompIices
OnIy we both know the whoIe truth
I am the chief minister speaking
What are your demands?
Have you come?
Are you showing your
true coIors to me?
You come up first
I'II come there
But free aII the hostages
Don't act
Come up
We have to change the front page news
News that wiII change the seat of power
Keep ready in the front page
I'II be in the office in an hour's time
Vasanthan on a murderous
streak for power
Unlimited Conspiracy
Traitor who made his friends scapegoats
You shouIdn't go in, sir
Stop being puppets to peopIe in power
Come back
Don't pIay with Iives of innocent peopIe
Don't shoot anyone without my order
Don't be scared
Don't get agitated
Come
CIose aII the windows
Are you pinning the cops on me?
I'II mediate with you Iater
Let me get hit by him first
What did Saro do to you?
She was innocent
How couId you...
Did the reporter extract aII information?
- Why?
- Let go
Why taIk of a finished story?
What do you want?
Start a teIevision channeI?
Newspaper of your own?
I'II give my fuII support
Or do you want a ministry?
I'II make you minister of information
Win in the bi-eIection for dead candidates
You are a beast seated on the death
of 30 innocent Iives
It is their sacrifice
You kiIIed aII these peopIe
and pretended to weep for them
You even refused to stand for eIection
- What an act!
- What can I do if you got fooIed?
Let me be the traitor
But in our SiragugaL, each member
has miIIion dreams to achieve
WiII you trampIe their dreams?
WiII such an apt ministry
ever happen again?
Are you pIanning to bury aII this effort
by pubIicizing through your paper?
What's your probIem?
You want to shoot?
How wiII you go out?
Not even an ant can escape the scrutiny
of aII the cops
What wiII you do?
ShaII I give you an idea?
HoId the gun to my head
Drag me out
AII the cops wiII make way
Ask for aII the vehicIe
and money to escape
Your demands wiII be met
Drop me at some city Iimit
and go away with your group
But if he is here both our stories
wiII be in shreds
Got it?
First finish his story
There's no time to think
I have taken onIy 10 minutes time
Then aII the commandos wiII barge in
I can trust him
Not you
This reporter has brainwashed him
He is not our Kadir
Don't run
Stop
If you shoot
cops wiII aIso shoot
Finish his story first,
without gun shot
Don't
There's no room for compassion
in our organization
Why did you change?
It's not too Iate
You aIso switch sides
Why are you pressurizing me?
I didn't want to kiII you with my hand
You are forcing me
Shoot
Shoot me now
What are you doing?
Don't take off your foot
It wiII expIode
If you move from here
I'II take my foot off
Wait
Don't
I'II caII the bomb squad
As tributary, we bubble with energy
We breeze through torridity!
Our ideas on tradition quite contrary
Without a hunter
we are a bird sanctuary
You said we'II be together tiII our death
Now you are Ieaving me in the Iurch?
Why shouId we die together
when we can both Iive?
- What happened?
- Are you okay?
Let me be the traitor!
But in our SiragugaL, each member
has million dreams to achieve
Will you trample their dreams?
Will such an apt ministry
ever happen again?
Are you planning
to bury all this effort?
Why did he go up?
Vasanthan on a murderous streak for power
Traitor who made his friends scapegoats
Listen to me
Why?
This shouId not be printed
Do as I teII you to
Did your friend buy you aIso?
You want me to Iet a mass murderer
go scot-free?
No...no more
Not even a handfuI of his ash remains
ShouId I hide aII the truth
because he's dead?
Try to understand me
His team didn't do anything wrong
OnIy Vasanthan was to bIame
No one eIse knows the inside story
If we bIurt it out now
Government wiII coIIapse
MiIIions of peopIe who wanted a turn
for the better wiII feeI cheated!
Never again can a youngster
ask for a vote!
AII our dreams wiII be trampIed
PIease don't print this news
No one shouId get wind of this
Krish is here
Vasanthan who went to mediate
was kiIIed by NaxaIites
How did you get this news?
Vasanthan sacrificed his Iife
to save the hostages
Vasanthan's supreme sacrifice
Chief minister Vasanthan went
to mediate the release of hostages
He died in the cross fire
His brave act has stunned the people
I couId have never been so courageous
This is the best reason for our nation
to be ruIed by our youth
May that brave souI rest in peace!
Despite the freedom you gave us
we crossed the boundaries of press ethics
We tender our resignation
I have been working diIigentIy
and honestIy for 25 years
Everyone generaIIy read the paper
and trashed it
But your faIsehood has changed
and re-written history
Make sure you cover the next
chief minister of SiragugaL
One smaII regret
What you achieved the entire nation
shouId be ceIebrating
But we are forced to bury the truth
between ourseIves
Without finishing what I assigned you
what were you gossiping there?
You shouId be sacked
You wiII never prosper
I know 'Ass'!
Mr SpirituaIity asked you
to come to the tempIe at 4:00 pm
Didn't Saro teII you
not to water this cactus?
You were right there when the bomb expIoded
Did you take a singIe photo?
Why the heII do you even come to work?
I'II make up for it in the next bIast
Poor me to be stuck with you
as photo editor
Which tempIe shouId I go to?
Mundakanni Amman tempIe
A Iie is at par with truth,
if it goes with fIawIess nobIe cause
- VaIIuvar
A PuLi - DDR Presentation ;)
