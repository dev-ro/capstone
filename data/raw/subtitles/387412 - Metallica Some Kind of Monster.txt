So, uh, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna play back
some of the band's new songs.
There'll be no cameras allowed in there.
There'll be no video.
No bags in there. You can only walk in
with paper and a pencil.
- We're ready.
- Are there any questions?
Do you want us in?
- Camera over here.
- Hello?
Was there ever a moment
you thought about stopping with Metallica
or the whole band was falling apart?
Was it a kind of a power struggle
between you and him?
How did you manage
to solve this crisis?
Where in God's name are you
getting all this aggression from
on this new album?
Where's it coming from?
Why did it take so long to release
an album with the new songs?
After 20 years, is it possible
to retain the fire that, you know,
you guys once had at the beginning?
Do you think the young generation of
metal fans will accept the new album?
85 million records, 22 years...
l think it's 11 albums
in various official releases.
One word...
Oh, my God.
One word to span our career? Uh...
Scanning the scene
in the city tonight
We're looking for you
to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new,
you know it drives us insane
Running, on our way,
hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running, on our way,
hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Thank you!
After 14 years of head-banging,
Metallica bassist Jason Newsted
has quit the band citing, quote,
"Private and personal reasons,
and the physical damage that
l've done to myself over the years
while playing the music I love."
Metallica's management had no comment
when asked by MTV News
if there's a replacement
waiting in the wings,
but the band is still scheduled to
begin recording a new album this spring.
That's the news for now,
Stay tuned...
l mean, I think everybody understands
the concept of trusting instincts.
That's getting to a place where
you don't let egos and let stuff
get in the way of artistic expression.
You know?
So, I mean this is... Do you wanna
say anything more about that?
'Cause I think everybody understands...
l met Metallica
through Q Prime Management,
after having seen me work
with another band of theirs.
When they called
and said that Metallica,
with Jason announcing that
he was exiting the group,
needed to take a look at itself and say,
"Well, what's going on here?"
"We've lost touch
with our personal relationships,"
and face some of the issues that
l think Q Prime feIt that they...
were headed for.
You know, we haven't really worked
together for almost nine months.
When we were talking
a couple of days ago about whether...
you know, if we wanted
to do this film or not,
l was wondering
if having these guys in here...
would affect that.
'Cause I'm just...
There's an intimacy that you get
when it's just a few people in the room,
and I'm just wondering
if that's gonna get lost,
if we're gonna go back to sort of, like...
battling each other
and trying to be, like, all strong and...
What intimacy?
What the fuck are you talking about?
l think, to me, it's not gonna be a matter
of whether the cameras are in play,
but whether or not you guys
are free enough to risk
being seen by other people.
We're here in the Presidio
in San Francisco...
and this is gonna be
the location where Metallica
is gonna start recording
their next album.
We decided that we didn't wanna
go back into a studio again
and do kind of like the same thing
we had done before.
We had to kind of change things up.
And this is one of the things
that we talked about,
was to go into a space
that's not a studio.
Bring in kind of like a portable studio,
or a makeshift studio,
and basically make
the situation uncomfortable.
You know, don't buy new furniture,
don't paint the walls.
Don't do anything.
Just keep it Spartan, keep it crude.
They're such a success
that you can get comfortable.
l don't think they
wanna be comfortable.
- There's definitely a vibe in here.
- They've got a lot of attitude
and I think they want it to come out
on this next album.
How did you approach
this record differently?
l mean, did you talk about things?
Did you have ideas, key words,
things like that that you wanted
to put across
before you actually started putting
the whole thing together?
Well, ego was a big one.
Coming in here...
and not bringing a riff, not bringing
a song, not bringing a title. Nothing.
Me and James
did not meet somewhere else
and come in here with material,
with songs, with music.
This time, we all got in a room
and just started playing,
and that's how we wrote songs.
The idea is it should sound like...
a band getting together in a garage
for the first time...
only the band's Metallica.
l really like going fast.
Just go off and meditate
in the wind, you know?
As corny as it sounds,
it works, and it feels good.
It's a good way to just let the weight
of the world off every once in a while.
It is kind of strange being...
you know, like, a famous guy.
You know?
This is... this is part of me that's
trying to be "unfamous," I guess.
But it's also
a go-against-the-rules attitude.
You know, is this something posed?
l mean, yes, this is a pose.
l mean, am I driving down the street
to not get noticed in this thing?
l mean, "rebellious" is kind of
what this says, I would say.
- Have you got a plug in here?
- Wait, wait, wait.
So what exactly are you doing?
Well, you'll just hold it
above the pick-ups.
Oh, OK. I gotcha.
Yeah!
Give me fire,
give me that which I desire
Give me fuel, give me fire,
give me that which I desire
Give me fuel, give me fire,
give me that which I desire
l got some bad news.
- Gonna have to...
- Change the lyrics?
- I like this thing, Bob.
- What?
l like this thing.
l used to kid myself that art
was my great escape away from music.
And I think l've become increasingly
aware that my interest in art,
music and Metallica
is not separate from anything.
You know, why does he feel that there's
enough of that kind of gold thing?
How come there isn't another 20 strokes
up in that black area up there
where it's kind of bare?
Where are the starting points
and where are the end points,
if you know what I mean?
When's a song done?
What the fuck does that mean, anyway?
"Done." When's a record done?
You know, where does a record start?
Where does it end?
Where does the process start?
Where the process end?
All that type of stuff.
Do you know what I mean?
- Daddy!
- It's really interesting. Yes, sweetie?
l don't feel anything great there.
- I don't think it's that great.
- How do you hear the riff, then?
l like that...
and then...
ln nine days it'll be
my two-year anniversary of surfing.
It's taken the place
of a lot of bad things in my life.
So I basically stopped
doing the drugs that I was doing,
and cut way back on my drinking.
You can't surf when you're hung over.
You can't surf if you've been up all night.
Well, at least I can't.
There's a sort of individualism, also,
about surfing that I like. I mean...
When it's your moment, man,
that's your moment and yours alone.
And no one can help you.
For all intents and purposes,
we go into this record completely equal.
Everybody contributing
just as much on the lyric front
as James contributing
with drum parts and...
As soon as you started talking
about that I just, like...
Yeah, yeah.
You flash back now?
Well...
You want to hear it with vocals?
Go sing it.
You guys had some rules
about that before.
Quite frankly, I don't give a fuck.
I'm tired of arguing.
You couldn't talk about his lyrics...
therefore, he couldn't talk
about your drumming.
- Right.
- Do you know what I mean?
And you and him did the solos,
so you weren't allowed
to comment on the solos.
Do you know what I mean?
There was, like, rules.
Are you telling me that
those boundaries are gone now?
ln the past, what we did
was started with a bunch of ideas
existing on tape from everybody.
Then me and James would sit down
and turn those ideas into songs,
and then we would tell the rest
of the band what to play
and when to play it and how to play it.
There was never any...
just other ways of doing it.
You know,
it's a whole new thing for me.
You know, writing in front of everybody.
'Cause l've always just gone
into my own head and wrote stuff down,
instead of taking things from outside
and putting them down.
You know, I was thinking this is, like,
"These are the hands that da-da-da..."
"This is the face that de-de-da-da..."
- So, it's like...
- Building a Frankenstein or something?
- Yeah. Pretty much.
- Building what?
- A Frankenstein.
- "This is the top of my head that's flat..."
"These are my boIts."
We're on the same stream
of consciousness here.
We're just all working
on the same creative wavelength.
And it's inspiring to me. Now I can
further express myself with these lyrics
now that, you know, James has
opened that door for Lars and l.
- This is "clay," right? Not "clam."
- Yeah. "Clay."
OK. "These hands finger the clam."
These are the eyes
that can't see through me
This is the tongue
that speaks on the inside
Make sure you really, like,
spit "can't see me."
"These are the eyes that can't see me."
These are the eyes
that can't see me
These are the hands
that drop your trust
- This is the...
- Yeah.
"This is the eye..." Yeah.
This is the eye that can't see me
This is the hand to drop your trust
These are the boots
that kick you around
This is the voice of silence no more!
What is this about?
Well, I mean, when I said "Frankenstein"
it's not that far off.
You're talking about pieces of things.
- I mean, some kind of monster.
- "Some kind of monster"?
You know.
- Some kind of monster.
- Some kind of monster?
- It is good.
- You know what I mean?
l like that.
Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster!
The monster lives
"We come now to create
our album of life."
"Throughout our individual
and collective journeys,
sometimes through pain and conflict,
we've discovered
the true meaning of family."
"As we accomplish uItimate togetherness,
we become healers of ourselves,
and the countless
who embrace us and our message."
"We have learned and we understand,
now we must share."
- So that's just, um...
- A mission statement.
- A what statement?
- Mission statement.
- "Mission"?
- Yeah, mission. It's, like, you know,
- it sets a goal...
- Right.
...so you can, like, just always
be reminded of, you know...
You know, what the uItimate goal is.
All right!
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, you cannot have it
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, my world, my world,
you cannot have it
Sucka!
- Excellent.
- Come on, little man, let's go.
Skylar, do you want your purse?
- Um...
- Daddy!
Oh, come, oh, come.
Come, Daddy! Come, Daddy!
l don't know how you guys feel,
but it's really awesome, what we're doing.
The four of us can just go
in a fuckin' room
and roll that kind of shit
out of our sleeves.
Pull it out of thin air, man.
It's so exciting, 'cause that
has just never happened before.
l couldn't get to sleep last night
'cause I was still wired from it all.
How do you feel?
You don't seem very psyched about it.
What the hell?
- How's it going, buddy?
- Good to see you.
- How many bears did you kill?
- Two.
Russia's fucked up.
You know, it was, like, you put
a bottle of water here on the table.
It was... that was it,
a bottle of vodka sitting there.
- Did you drink vodka?
- Hell, yeah!
- You did?
- What else is there to drink?
As soon as we got there,
it was, like, "Na zdorovia!"
Na zdorovia!
That's a pretty big bear.
ls bear edible?
They were no good to eat. That freaked
me out, when they didn't take any meat.
You know, they have been hibernating
for three months,
so they haven't pissed or shit or nothing.
- So they're toxic?
- Yeah.
Third day, l'd killed my bear and I was
just in camp for the rest of the time.
- It's, like, "Oh, my God."
- Worked on lyrics?
Yeah. I actually did.
There was a lot of time, man.
A lot of time.
- I worked on lyrics in Siberia.
- How to drink vodka and work on lyrics.
Temptation wreck my head
Temptation make you dead
Temptation sucks my soul
Temptation fill no hole!
Temptation
Fuck you up
Temptation
No, no, no, no,
l can't say no
Can't say no, no, no
No, no, no, can't say no
Oh, no, I can't say no
Go away
Leave me be
Just leave me be
So, what were the reactions you got
from those close?
l mean, how did the family react?
I'm just... I don't know.
Sometimes I'm a real ass about it
and just come in and say, you know,
"Oh, by the way,
I'm going to Russia
for two weeks right here."
You know, and, "What?", you know?
Yeah, I'm getting better at that,
you know, 'cause...
That was the most
l missed my family, ever.
- You know?
- Right.
And it was, you know,
Castor's first birthday I missed.
- Right.
- And it was...
Of course, we had
a little vodka, to Castor.
You know, a little shot for him
and everything.
But I would have loved to
have been able to get ahold of home.
- Who's here?
- This is Daddy's working.
- This is where Dad works?
- Yeah.
- What does your dad do for work?
- Dums.
- He plays drums?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Is he good at it?
- Let me play dums.
- Daddy want to play dums?
- I played drums a lot today already.
I'm OK. You play for a while.
- Those guys...
- That's very good.
...you know, their plate is filled
with many, many things.
And music is just one of the things.
Say "Bye, James."
- Bye, James.
- Bye, buddy.
l chose not to have children
and do those kind of things.
My music...
That's my children, you know?
But since I decided
to do it with music,
then that's what I have
to fill my time with.
Echobrain is one of the projects
that l've been working on for years,
and now it's come to fruition.
And then, when it comes to the time
where my main cat, James, tells me that...
that basically,
he couldn't be in a band with me
if I took this other project to this level.
And after 15 years of working together,
and going on buses, and...
You know the stories, man.
There is no way that this thing
that I was doing could affect
the monster of Metallica.
l just don't see how it could.
And so, in saying things like that,
l couldn't accept that kind of, um...
limited acceptance.
l also know that
this relationship is not over.
You know, he'll...
it'll come around again at some point.
You guys will make contact.
At that time, the manager suggested
that we have a psychotherapist come in,
a man that meets with pro-ball teams -
you know, big-ego, big-dollar guys
that can't get along,
but have to make some kind of entity flow
so everybody else
and everybody can make their money.
And, uh, I actually said,
"l think that this is really fucking lame
and weak that we cannot get together."
"Us! Look, we're the biggest
heavy band of all time!"
"And the things we've been through,
the decisions we've made
about squillions of dollars
and squillions of people."
"And this... we can't get over this?"
Was it more than just the Echobrain
thing? 'Cause that's, like, you know,
what has been discussed.
He feIt like he wasn't free enough
to do what he needed to do.
Since he wasn't getting
his creativity out enough in Metallica,
he needed to get it out somewhere else.
And I totally understand that now.
And, uh...
on my side of that was...
l didn't want him to enjoy that
more than Metallica.
l didn't want anyone to leave Metallica.
l didn't want to feel that we weren't
enough, or something like that.
And it was through my, I guess...
The way I learned how to love things
was just to choke 'em to death.
You know?
"Don't go anywhere. Don't leave."
You know?
"You have to stay here."
OK.
l need a pen,
none of this pencil shit.
Check it out, man,
They can't fuckin' spell it right.
"Metllica."
We've only been together 20 years.
l feel guiIty that
I'm not inspired all the time.
You know,
especially when everyone else is.
- True.
- It's, like, OK.
We kind of get to the point where
the song is looped twice in the ProTools
and I know Bob's gonna
hit me up for some kind of lyric ideas.
Ah, shit! I was, like,
dreading the whole process.
It's, like, "Why are you dreading it?
Why don't you just...?"
You were dreading it because of what?
Let's get to the fear.
- Well, because I didn't have anything, or...
- And so if you didn't have anything...?
...wasn't inspired enough
to have something...
- And you didn't have anything?
- ...or letting down the team,
- or some vibe like that.
- OK.
One, two, three, five...
Say it, all right, yeah
Motherfuckin' in my head
It's like I'm almost, like,
racing against time.
There's, like, a weird-ass fear of, like...
"l gotta come up with something
myself really quick
before somebody else comes up
with something for me."
And then if I don't like it
or don't 100% embrace it,
then I'm just being a selfish...
you know, insular asshole.
It's a fear response.
When we're up against a fear,
that's the time to move into it forward.
Because there's gonna be
some kind of genius there
or some kind of breakthrough.
Oh, motherfucker, yeah
Yeah!
Metallica! Metallica!
Kirk.
Kirk.
- Kirk.
- Kirk!
- Kirk.
- Kirk!
- Kirk.
- Kirk!
- Yes.
- Kirk.
- James is trying to talk to you.
- Sorry, man.
Yeah, it's a bit stock.
Check it out, guys.
l don't know how you feel.
I'm in a shit mood, and...
I'm not diggin' it right now.
Even last night, I gotta tell you,
everybody kind of looked...
- I hate to tell you, looked pretty burnt.
- I agree.
And if we don't start earlier
and end earlier, I'm just...
I'm not gonna be in a good mood
for the rest of the shit, you know?
- That was totally weird for me.
- You hear that, Bob?
Why don't you try
getting a more solid beat?
- Regular?
- Oh, well, you call it "regular."
- No, you call it "regular."
- No, I'm trying not to call it "regular."
'Cause I know it bugs you
when I call it "regular."
So a little more solid, then.
Fuck!
Maybe we should talk about next week.
Well, all next week is therapy.
- Yeah.
- Do we have to do that?
Can we sack Phil?
l mean, we gotta find...
we gotta find a balance to not...
You know, the Phil stuff's important,
and I hope we all feel that
that's an investment in the music.
It's an important part of the record.
Get all holy again, yeah
Let me just go put one together.
Get all holy again
It's just real confusing-sounding.
It's just jackin' the vocals all up.
l mean...
l mean, it's clever and everything, but...
l mean, I don't see what it does to this.
l think that's how you hear it, dude.
That's fine.
I'm just trying to do something different.
l mean, I'm... I'm used to having
the drummer do the beat part.
You know what I mean?
Holding it together.
Um... What I'm hearing is...
l'll choose my words carefully here.
Um... It's pretty straightforward.
And the guitar shit, it's...
you know, it's a little stock.
So I started trying to introduce
some kind of edge to it on the drums.
Those things we throw out to each other
are complete bullshit. You know?
It sounds too stock.
It sounds too normal to me.
That... I mean...
You know what I mean?
You're saying this shit, so...
you can get your point across
about doing a drum beat. I mean...
- You know, it doesn't hold any water.
- To you.
- It doesn't!
- I think it's fuckin' stock!
What... which part of that
is unclear to you?
l think it sounds stock to my ears.
l mean, do you want me
to write it down?
- I think it feels stock, OK?
- Oh, yeah, please write it down.
- I hear you.
- So l...
No, when you say... You're telling me
what to play, right now.
You're telling me, "You should play
with what Kirk's doing."
And I'm telling you it's stock.
- Dude, fine.
- You know what, guys?
Why don't we just go in there
and just hammer it out, all right?
lnstead of hammering on each other.
We're in shit moods and we're not
gonna get anything done here today.
All you wanna do is pick a fuckin' fight.
And you...
l don't wanna pick a fight.
This is so silly. You're just sitting there
going, "I'm in a really pissy mood, and..."
And I fuckin' told you,
straight up, that I was!
- Right.
- And what are you trying to do?
I'm not trying to do fuckin' shit! You're
just sitting here being a complete dick.
You're really helping matters.
You're really good at that.
l was straight up with you
and I told you, "I'm in a shit mood."
And what have you been doing?
Fuckin' pickin' at me all night.
Come on, guys.
We've got better things to do.
Yeah, I do. I do.
Metallica frontman James Hetfield
has entered a rehabilitation facility
to undergo treatment for alcoholism
and other undisclosed addictions.
ln a statement posted on Metallica's
official website, the band writes:
"James has entered
an undisclosed facility,
and he will continue to receive treatment
until further notice."
"Until then, we have postponed
all current activities,
including recording sessions
for our new album."
Metallica, whose hard-partying ways
earned them the nickname "Alcoholica,"
have been working on their follow-up
to the 1998 double-disc collection
of covers...
Not only do I not know the answer
l don't even know
what the question is!
God, it feels
Like it only rains on me
God, it feels...
l think it's easy to see
that in those days,
Metallica brought
a kind of physicality to rock-'n'-roll.
Let's say the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,
you know, and all that,
inspired some of the British rock music
that then developed after that.
And let's say the metal music,
and Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath
and all of that.
And then, out of that, again, then...
let's say, then came Lars
and all of that in being.
So, I think that they have certainly
a place in all of that, I think.
Lars had a very good vision, at the time,
of where he saw that particular...
you know, the metal music going.
Because he could see it
with European ears and eyes, maybe.
Don't you feel that it's great for you
to have your father's perspective on...
on who you are
and what you're doing?
l think that's incredible, and it's...
You talk about the lineage,
which we did. We talked a little bit
about your grandfather...
It's very difficuIt to admit it,
especially with him standing next to me.
It's easier to talk about
when he's not in my presence.
But, um, of course it is.
- Yeah.
- What would you say in private?
- To who?
- To anybody, without him here.
Say it. You know, what would it be?
Well, I mean, l've already said it
to you countless times.
Well, have you said it to him?
What is it that you...?
You brought it up. I didn't bring it up.
What is it you feel you've said
that you're not saying now?
l think maybe in some ways,
some of the, um...
- To me, that's...
- ...fear of status quo
comes a little bit
from this direction over here.
l think that, um...
l mean, there's nothing worse
than when I have to go to him
and play the new record
and know there's
something on there that sucks.
And he can see right through that
in two-and-a-half seconds flat.
Comments on that one?
l would say... You know,
if you said, "lf you were our advisor,
what would you say?",
then I would say, "Delete that."
l mean... I don't know for you guys.
For me, it doesn't cut it. You know?
- But, uh...
- lnteresting.
l mean, it's interesting,
you know, now...
- Other than the people involved here...
- Yeah.
...the only other people who've heard
any of this music is Cliff Burnstein.
Yeah.
When Cliff Burnstein heard that,
he thought that should open the record.
Yeah. I mean, that could well be.
But I'm pretty sure that...
l really...
That... I really don't think so.
You know?
l really don't think so.
Right.
For me, that doesn't sound right
or something, you know?
Unless I'm a guy that's kind of
shouting in some kind of echo chamber.
So I think one of our responsibilities here
is to act like a band is still continuing.
We're going on.
We're doing our exploring.
We're exploring ourselves individually.
We're exploring our relationships.
And we really need to get together,
talk about this,
act like the band exists,
because it does exist.
And if we don't do that,
then we are the co-producers
of the process slipping off the planet.
It's a bit of a shit sandwich, though.
What is it, the unraveling of a band?
And then there were two?
So, uh, a good friend of mine phoned me,
and he knew where James was.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He couldn't even imagine James
doing anything for six months.
I'm prepared for the worst.
I'm pretty confident that, you know,
we will come together
when the time is right.
But knowing when that time will come...
or not knowing when that time will come,
is very, very uncomfortable.
l hope that at some point,
he will come back
and try and finish
the making of this record.
lf...
lf he walked away from Metallica,
I'm not sure that it would surprise me.
Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son,
to include everyone
l'll tuck you in free from sin
l've always feIt that James was
a softer, more caring,
compassionate person
than he allowed himself
to be to most people.
l can remember
from the Dave Mustaine days,
l mean, when him and Dave Mustaine...
These guys, they started, like,
right away with their big, you know,
chest-beating and their mannerisms.
And the whole thing was very much
about this kind of, like, macho.
And it was just, like,
l couldn't deal with that stuff.
And looking back on, what,
18, 19 years ago,
l mean, I just feIt so alienated
because it was just so far removed
from the upbringing
that I come from.
Well, here's to you, my friends.
But then, at the same time,
I'm starting to realizing now
that the sort of depressive things
that show up as a resuIt
of the alcohol and stuff like that,
it was just very difficuIt for him
- to communicate from the heart...
- You want some or not?
...and not hide behind
a lot of these different fronts.
Whether it's alcohol that gives him
a false sense of strength,
or "the frontman in Metallica," or, you
know, macho bullshit and all that stuff.
All right, now you guys are drunk
and I'm drunk.
Now this is the fun part, man.
l want to help him,
l want to be there for him,
and I want to do the best I can to
make him the best person that he can be.
So I don't know how the fuck
it's gonna play out.
It's really heaIthy for me to be here
without any pressure
or anything related to the band
or anyone who would
remind me of the band,
and, uh, recognize what's real.
Our sessions with Phil really
stirred up a lot of things in James
that he feIt
that he needed to address.
Mentally, it's really taken its toll
on myself, you know,
'cause I'm very worried about him.
And, you know,
whenever you check yourself into rehab,
they don't focus on, you know,
the fact that you're an alcoholic.
They go much deeper.
You know?
l mean, they go way deep.
They crack you open,
and then spill you out and examine
all the things that are on the table.
l've spoken to him a few times,
and, you know,
l know he's having a rough trip.
No matter how bad it gets,
eventually, things seem
to sort themselves out.
Sooner or later.
Whether it's good or bad,
they sort themselves out.
l watch the people around the world
say what a great guitar player Kirk is,
and what a piece of shit I am.
And that I got kicked out
of Metallica.
And I wasn't good enough for them.
And that I was a loser.
And l've had to deal
with that for almost 20 years.
And it's a dreadful experience.
It's been hard, Lars.
It's been hard to watch everything that
you guys do and you touch turn to gold,
and everything I do fuckin' backfire.
And I'm sure
there's a lot of people that...
they would consider my backfire
a complete success, you know?
And am I happy being number two? No!
You know? You're just now
encountering something
l've been going through 13, 14 years.
l've never had a chance
to be able to tell you without...
talking to Lars, the guy in Metallica.
l've never talked to
my little Danish friend again. You know?
l remember the day you and I talked
about digging a hole in fuckin' dirt
and smoking hash through the ground.
That, to me, is the stuff that's like...
You know? And we've never had
very many moments like that.
Do I feel some guiIt?
Uh, yes, I do.
But at the same time,
it's difficuIt for me to comprehend
that the only thing that you feel
when you look back
on the last 20 years...
is rooted in the Metallica thing.
OK.
Have you ever thought
what l've been through?
l think l've had an awareness
of the pain I caused you.
- Um...
- That's not what I said.
OK. Um...
- Do you have any idea...
- Of what I put you through?
No, no, no.
...what I went through?
l mean, people hate me
because of you.
l walk down the street and I hear
some piece of shit say "Metallica!" at me.
And they do that to taunt me.
l mean, when I would hear Metallica
on the radio, I would be, like,
"God, I have to turn this off," because
l just keep thinking, "l fucked up!"
Right.
l've been waiting for this day
for a long time.
You know, and by no means is it done,
because somebody else
very important is not here.
Right.
Do I wish it was 1982 all over again
and you guys woke me up and say,
"Hey, Dave, you know what?
You need to go to AA"? Yeah.
l'd give anything for that chance.
ls there any last words you want
to say to everybody out there?
Metal up your ass!
OK, thank you. This is Donna Davis
and this is Metallica.
This is, like, a pretty bitchin' club
to play the first fucking gig.
- Yeah.
- How do you guys feel?
Stoked.
- Freaking out. Totally.
- Freakin' out?
Freaking out.
It's fuckin' unbelievable.
l think what it comes down to...
Can I say that?
- Yeah, you can say whatever you want.
- Great. Great.
It's fucking unbelievable.
Echobrain! Yeah!
l don't know, just all of a sudden,
this became, like, such a big production.
l don't understand. It's, like,
all of a sudden, I get, like, one phone call.
It's like everybody and their
fuckin' brother are in town.
l thought it'd be Jason, like,
playing with his new band
in front of, you know, like, 20 drunks
down at some bar or something.
And now, I guess,
through my own ignorance or something,
l guess that's what I wanted it to be.
So now I'm realizing that
supposedly it's a little more
of a big deal than that.
- Hey, man.
- Thanks. Thanks, man, thanks.
- Awesome, dude. Awesome.
- Oh, thank you. Right on.
- I'm Lars. How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.
- Great to meet you.
- Where's Jason?
- Jase?
- I don't know.
Dude, I think he went back to...
l think he already fucking bailed.
- I think he might have went back to...
- Did he? Really?
Nice! I go back to say hey,
and he's, like, fucking gone.
"Elvis has left the building."
There's Zach. Hey, Zach!
See, he's even blowing me off.
Jason blows me off, Zach blows me off.
How quick we become yesterday's news.
Yeah! No kidding.
See, there's a guy
in an Echobrain T-shirt.
Yeah, that's Steve over there.
He works at the studio with us.
- Well, it is.
- Really?
- Yeah. I remember that guy.
- Huh?
l remember that guy.
He worked at the studio.
- Which guy?
- Over there.
The guy in the red shorts?
No, the guy in the black
that's walking across right now.
- Really?
- Kessel.
Todd. He works at the studio,
too, doesn't he?
- Who?
- Todd over there.
I'm sure they're all here, Bob.
l mean, the only two people in the bay
area not working for him is me and you.
Hetfield's gonna freak.
I'm in fucking hell.
This whole gig has
brought all of this on, hasn't it?
- Yes, it has. It's made me feel like...
- You really wanna come clean.
It made me feel like such a loser.
l mean, I can't hold
my band together, you know?
l start records, I don't finish them.
l fucking...
Jason is the future.
Metallica's the past.
l've never had a break like this,
in 20 years. Do you know what I mean?
And just what's been kind of getting me
is just not knowing.
Do you know what I mean?
Not knowing, and not hearing,
that's just like...
It just eats away at you.
Kirk talked to him.
- I talked to James today.
- Oh, cool.
What did he say?
He basically said that, you know,
his family's the priority right now,
and he needs time
to work on his family
before he can reach out
to his other family, being us.
And that he loves us, and he just needs
for us to understand that he needs time.
And he also went on about
how difficuIt it was talking to you
about it, because he feIt pressured.
And, you know, he spoke about
how you always need to be
in control of the situation,
or in control of the schedule, or whatever.
And he said that this is a time
he needs complete control
of the situation.
And he said, you know,
all the Marc Reiters, and the Bob Rocks,
all that stuff, you know, just has...
"l can't think of that right now."
So, you know, I got the feeling that
he kind of lumps in your relationship
with the business side of things.
Which was, actually,
really surprising to me.
But I think that's,
you know, that explains a lot
on why he hasn't spoken to you.
We're just in limbo,
and the longer James chooses
to stay away from dealing with us,
the further we drift apart.
And I just feel so...
disrespected...
that that's the key thing.
Was the future of the group ever in doubt,
even when James went into rehab,
do you think?
Lars and l, we were wondering
when James was going to finally feel
like he was in a situation where
he can come back to the band.
And after a certain amount of months,
you know, Lars and I started to think,
"Well, is he ever gonna
come back to the band?"
And that was a really
big question on our plates.
Whether or not, you know,
he wanted to come back.
James wrote something in the new issue
of our magazine, So What.
He wrote a kind of
a little handwritten note.
That note was probably
the most heartfeIt thing
l'd ever seen come from his mind.
Tomorrow is shaping up,
or is gearing itself up, to be...
Yes, the first sit-down
with one James Hetfield, post-rehab.
- Why are we filming this?
- I don't know.
We're in very different places.
Or, at least, I am in a very different
place than I was from the Presidio.
That's a huge understatement.
So, we just have to find
that if, you know,
if the movie will be as intense,
you know?
To me, there was a lot of intrusion
and I kind of went with it,
and feIt...
l feIt uncomfortable.
l feIt uncomfortable with it.
You know, a boom following me around,
and it just feIt like I was in the spotlight
all the time, and I didn't...
l guess I don't really like that feeling.
While we were in the Presidio
filming you guys playing,
- did you feel it then, too?
- Yeah.
It was pretty much all the time.
l mean, do you think
you're in a better place now?
- We've got to find some avenue...
- I'm definitely in a better place.
...some place that makes
you feel comfortable.
The last thing we want to do
is have it impede on your music,
because that's more important
than anything, right?
You know, one answer may be...
Maybe there shouldn't be a film.
l mean, that's the range of possibilities
that we should really think about,
because... I mean,
why do you guys want a film?
Even you said you hoped
that the film is made. I mean...
That's a big question, because for me,
it was really just, it came along
with being in Metallica -
"Hey, we're gonna do this."
"Oh, OK."
That's part of this, all of this.
The bigness of Metallica.
And I'm kind of tired of it.
You might look at it as a friend.
To me, it's been a beast.
And it's sucked a lot of me into it.
You were maybe the keeper
of the beast at one point.
You know, because you were
the champion of that fifth... that entity.
And of course you got to just find
the right balance between
what everybody's personal needs are,
but if Metallica collectively
decides to do this,
then I think Metallica can make it happen.
l don't know, that scares me again.
Metallica is three individuals,
and three individuals
have to decide if it's good to do.
l still think that
the priority is the collective,
until all the people involved
in the collective say
that the priority is the individual.
And, so far, you're the only one
that said the priority is the individual.
l haven't said that,
and he hasn't said that.
l haven't heard him say that.
So I feel that it's still...
there's still an unbalance there.
We met from, like, maybe,
l don't know, six or eight weeks
before we actually picked up
the project again.
That was when we came in
and it was the first time
we actually used this studio, HQ.
Anyway, here we are. HQ.
Right on. Well, we're here.
And the camera's here.
And my friend the boom is here.
- Hovering.
- Yeah. Cool.
Want me to play the music?
Yeah, let's go.
- I'm...
- l'll put the big speakers on.
l was afraid to pick up a guitar,
and fearful of what would happen.
Would I not like it?
Would I love it? Would I not be able
to write anything cool?
Would I write just recovery stuff?
James.
It's probably the best sound
l've ever heard in my life,
was the fact that you
were playing guitar in here.
Right on, brother.
Play a riff.
- What?
- Nothing.
- See? It feels pretty good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
It feels like the next day.
A year later, the next day.
It's gonna be interesting
working on the schedule,
because we really haven't.
It's gonna be great.
And kind of the overview is, you know,
the less time we have here,
the more productive we'll be,
in a way. You know?
It's, like, we're more focused
on getting the stuff done.
That all sounds really good.
OK. Now let's revisit it in a week.
So, um, I think that...
Don't talk it, walk it.
At some point, we are gonna
have to work a little harder.
- Yes.
- Yeah. When that feels right.
What do you mean?
What does that mean?
- What does that mean?
- Yeah.
When you say "harder,"
does that mean more hours?
You know, if we can go deep real quick.
- Be intense.
- I spoke up, because,
what does that mean, we have to,
you know, do eight hours now?
l got fearful right then.
That's OK.
l mean it's, like, yeah.
- To do eight hours?
- No.
Any lyric ideas?
- I'm searching for...
- "Searching for doughnuts."
Searching for doughnuts
I'm searching for doughnuts
What was the whole thing
from yesterday? The Buddhist...
- Guarantee. What?
- No, the Buddhist thing that you had...
"Birth is pain.
Life is pain. Death is pain."
The cycle of suffering.
It's called "samsara."
Where are you with this, James?
- Somewhere else.
- OK.
- Where's today's sweat going?
- "l've worn out being afraid."
"My endless parade, of fear
that l've constantly made."
"My lifestyle determines my deathstyle.
A rising tide that pushes
- "My deathstyle."
- ...to the other side."
l've worn out being afraid, endless parade
Of fear that l've constantly made
This frantic tick-tick-tick-tock
l'd gladly trade
Oh, I need to know the answer
where l'll be laid
l can't find it
- It just... it doesn't work.
- The great... you did one great thing.
- You went "Do-do-do..."
- Yay!
You did this one syncopated thing.
Do the whole verse like that.
Worn out, always being afraid
An endless stream of fear
that l've made
This frantic tick-tick-tick-tock
l'd gladly trade
It's weird, it's weird.
You know?
No, but the second time
you feIt really comfortable with it.
- Right.
- Oh, by the way, it's quarter to four.
l gotta get rolling, guys. Sorry.
l feel like the bad guy saying,
"l gotta go, 'cause it's 4:00."
lf we all know,
and we all do know,
that 4:00 is kind of the stop time,
then, I don't know,
then I won't feel like
the heel here, saying,
"l got to go eat dinner
with my kids," you know?
'Cause I have a feeling, you know,
I'm gonna walk out of here,
and you guys are gonna go in there
and listen to this stuff,
- and it's, like... that's not right.
- That's not.
l mean, if I wanna listen to it,
l'll go and listen to it.
- But we should at least listen to it...
- lf you're gonna stop early...
But I know you'll sit there
and start talking with Bob.
Maybe Bob doesn't
want to sit in there.
When I'm gone, things get talked about,
and then decisions are made,
and I feel I walk into something
that's already kind of decided.
And it's a total uphill battle for me
a lot of times. I don't like that feeling.
Well, that's like...
just like the last 15 years...
- Yeah.
- ...for me.
Well, let's talk about this
tomorrow then, all right?
- Or do you want to take time out...?
- No, I don't have time right now.
It's past four.
It's hard to introduce structure
into this, and I'm trying.
- So what do you think, Lars?
- Can we do the song from yesterday?
- That we all heard together?
- How is that different?
Because we all heard it
together already.
Well, what he wants
is to be a part of everything.
- Was I in there?
- Yes, you were.
- We all heard it together.
- You came in.
All right. As long as
you don't talk about it.
- ls that a way around it, or is that just...?
- That is definitely a way around it.
How about if we just
save up the tension...?
Seriously. I mean, it's OK,
because tension produces resuIts.
Above!
Below!
Quiet.
I'm excited to see
what you learned here.
Go up and back.
Up and freeze!
What is this called?
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.
I'm so glad I got to see you.
I'm working on,
really hard, on being
the best dad and father
and husband I can be.
And the best me.
You worked hard.
l don't want to lose
any of the stuff I have.
l know it could all go away at one time.
And that's a tough part of life.
And then, it's just...
it's a total rebirth for me.
Looking at life in a whole new way.
You know, all the other drinking,
and all the other junk that I was stuck in.
It was so predictable. So boring.
I'm out there looking for excitement,
and all this stuff.
The resuIts are the same, man.
l wake up the next day somewhere,
in some bed, I don't know
who this person is next to me,
and I'm drunk, completely hung over,
and have a show to do.
The resuIt is the same, you know?
When life now is pretty exciting.
You don't know what's gonna happen,
when you're kind of clear and here
and in the now. In the moment.
My lifestyle
determines my deathstyle
A rising tide
that pushes to the other side
My lifestyle
determines my deathstyle
A rising tide
that pushes to the other side
- I think those two feel the best to me.
- It's a tough one to decide.
They all kind of got...
some charm, don't you think?
Yeah, l'd be interested to hear
the first one. The first pick.
- Well, let's play it.
- ls it OK?
- Are we allowed?
- Yeah, we are.
- Do we have...?
- We never really settled that, did we?
We didn't settle it.
Yes. We're allowed.
l'd like to hear it.
Feel free to leave the room,
whoever doesn't wanna be part of that.
Do I have the strength
to know how it goes?
l feIt like it was an agreement.
We're gonna work from 12 to 4.
And then we would not work.
Well, if Lars and I listen to something,
or go through the Presidio stuff,
it's not because we wanna
do something behind your back.
- It's for you.
- Right.
And basically, what I heard is,
"No, I can't do that."
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know, my mind, it gets lopsided.
The more it goes in a different direction,
the harder it is.
- The harder it is to get that back.
- What is it you have to get back?
Some control. Some sense of...
involvement in the band.
When I was running this morning,
thinking about seeing you today,
the word "fuck" just comes up so much.
Seriously. It's really true.
- ls that in anger?
- No, just "Fuck! Fuck."
l just think
you're so fucking self-absorbed.
And what makes it worse is
that you always talk about...
you always talk about me, you use the
word "control" and "manipulation" a lot.
l think you control on purpose,
and I think you control inadvertently.
l think you control
by the rules you always set.
l think you control
by how you always judge people.
l think you control by your absence.
l think you control all this
even when you're not here.
l don't understand who you are.
l don't understand the program.
l don't understand all the stuff, OK?
l realize now
that I barely knew you before.
And all these rules,
and all this shit, man -
this is a fucking rock-'n'-roll band.
l don't want fucking rules.
l understand that
you need to leave at 4:00. I respect it.
But don't tell me I can't sit and listen to
something with Bob at 4:15 if I want to.
What the fuck is that?
You know, l...
l don't wanna end up
like Jason, OK?
l don't want to be pushed away.
l don't want it to happen twice.
Let's do it, and let's fucking do it full-on,
or let's not do it at all.
Fuck. See? Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Totally! Yeah!
Let's hear it for Elena!
Ooh, all right!
We're not anywhere near
getting any issues resolved.
Well, let's get 'em.
That's what we're here to do.
l don't know, I guess the playing part,
being in the room,
and then mainly being in the room
with Lars, playing music together.
l guess I had higher expectations.
And I don't know,
maybe I'm disappointed in myself.
Maybe... I don't know.
Want to talk about that?
l mean, what does that mean?
I'm not enjoying being in the room
with you, playing.
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching, yeah
Seek and destroy
Searching, yeah
Seek and destroy
lf you are not having any fun,
let me let it be known to you
that I'm certainly not having
a lot of fun, either.
But I am not interested
in playing music with you
if you're not happy in there.
l just don't want
to become a fucking parody.
OK? So if you're not happy
playing music with me...
ls there enough that connects us
to hold on for a...
a way through this?
l don't know.
There are moments where I really doubt it.
l really doubt it.
I'm glad you said that.
Because I really, deep down,
feel sometimes that it's just...
There's just some empty, just...
Just an ugly feeling inside.
Just... I don't know.
How much work are we
gonna put into this?
- When you're doing the...
- Yeah.
Let's do our little round-table
thing right now, quickly.
Everybody's got to participate.
Lars? Come on.
Hey, Castor, why don't you look
at all the boys - the men, I should say -
and say bye to everybody.
- Bye, Castor.
- Thank you for coming.
- ls Daddy going bye-bye?
- No, your dada's staying here, OK?
Bye. See you.
So what's the deal? How does
everybody feel about what they heard?
Of course, lyrics will
definitely work in that feel.
- Yeah.
- That kind of intro bit that's on there.
What about you? What do you think?
Do you think it's good? Was there
anything in particular that you...?
No, I wasn't paying attention
that detailed.
That's just...
It's a lot of good stuff.
l can take you back, when me and him
were alone in my room, in 1981,
listening to New Wave
or British heavy-metal singles.
As soon as there was
somebody else in the room,
it just became this, like...
It just had a very different energy to it.
- None of that was usable?
- Yeah.
- That's a fuck... that's a fucking bitch.
- Let's do another version of it, OK?
The first time I got a real awareness of it
was when Mustaine came into the picture.
When James was with Mustaine,
he became like...
He never really cared about me.
There was one time, during the recording
of the Ride the Lightning record,
where me and him went out,
and 42 beers later,
he's, like, "Ooh, dude, I love you."
But it could never have materialized
until it got to that 42-beer point.
And we were alone.
That was good!
Are you sure
l don't have to play it again?
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's good practice, though.
- For what?
- The road.
- When?
- A couple of years.
From day one, it's been competitive.
And, in a way, that's what
has made Metallica what it is.
That's what's driven us further.
- What feels good to you?
- I don't know. We'll try a bunch more.
Can you try maybe like
a blah, blah, blah, blah...?
Almost like a strum.
