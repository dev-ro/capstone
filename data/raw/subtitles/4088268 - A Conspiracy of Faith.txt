Assad.
Not now.
- Come on Assad.
Come on.
- I'm working Rose.
Just one round.
- I'm working.
Come on Assad.
One round.
- Have you trained?
Yes, but I have to practice on you.
- Are you serious?
Bam, bam, bam... Hook.
Bam, bam, bam...
Yes, that's right. Come on.
- Flex your muscles, Assad!
Uh, uh...
Carl Mørck. Leave a message.
I have a new case for Department Q.
It's a message in a bottle.
You might be the only ones who can solve it.
Who is...?
- Pasgård.
Where is Mørck?
- Didn't you know?
Jacobsen put him on sick leave.
It was awful.
He was just walking around, doing nothing.
You couldn't make contact.
It was like, well...
Carl's always in a bad state,
but this time....
It was really bad.
- Rose?
Some times...
- Rose?
He's doing fine.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Where did you get this?
- A retired soldier found it up north.
He thought you should have it.
Have fun.
It was nice to meet you.
- Bye.
Bye.
- My name is Rose.
Right. Pasgård.
Isn't this blood?
Yes, it could be.
We should send it to the lab.
- Yeah.
Carl?
Hey.
- Hey...
The door was open.
- Oh.
Ok.
What's going on?
- Um...
You should have been
back at work.
Yes, I should... Yeah.
Lets take a walk.
- What?
Put on a fresh shirt,
and we'll go for a walk.
Yes...
Remember to fold your hands.
The just lord.
The almighty lord.
The beautiful lord.
Hear us, your faithful servants.
Your eternal servants. Your chosen ones.
Elias?
Come!
Come.
I baptize you in the name of the father...
... in the name of the son.
... repent and accept his will.
We haven't seen you
in church for a while.
I know. Time flies.
Must be more than a year.
It's a nice farm.
Really nice.
Pretty fields... A beautiful place.
It's not a farm anymore.
Just a house.
I had to sell the grounds.
- We're doing fine.
Elias is working at the market garden.
- Please.
I'm doing the congregation's books,
so... we're doing alright.
Elias. Family and faith,
are the most important things.
Right.
Goodnight, mom. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, dad.
- Goodnight, children.
Goodnight, father.
- Goodnight.
Is it true?
- Yes.
Yes, Magdalena has been chosen
messenger for the entire region.
You know what, Magdalena?
You have a light in your heart,
just like your mom and dad.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
It was lovely to see you again.
I feel blessed.
Thank you.
- Yes, thanks, and safe travels.
May God bless you and the children.
- Thank you.
Guess we'll see you in a year?
"Bus stop".
That is correct.
Yes.
- And... here.
Could be "children", right?
- Right. "Mom and dad" for sure.
Right?
- Yes. Um...
Right. We know that the bottle
has been in the water for a long time.
The algae is 6 or 7 years old minimum.
- Yes.
The letter is written in tar.
It could've been dropped off a boat.
There's a lighthouse, so it could
have been thrown close to land.
We've confirmed there's a lot
of blood on the paper.
We know that someone's name
starts with a P.
I think a child wrote it...
... man is misspelled,
and it says mom and dad, right?
What about this us,
it was...
... is it f-o-o-l. fool us?
I think it's an f,
as in far.
Doesn't it? Us far.
- Oh right.
Took us far away.
Lets say you need help
and write a letter.
What would you write first?
- Where you are.
Or who took you.
- Yes.
A man, right?
A man named...
Yes, a child would write
naimed, with an i.
Wait, so it spells...
Jehova... will... save... us.
Jehova will save us.
Jehova's Witnesses.
Lets look at children who've been
reported missing in the last 10 years.
I'll ask around.
Do you realize how many children
have vanished in the last 10 years?
Two.
Both times, the press ran wild.
But there hasn't been a P.
No Jehova's Witness. Nothing.
Well thanks, Carl.
Hey guys. This thing's a bit
of a time waster.
I used seven different colors for the scan,
and it came up short.
Even showed nothing on the infrared.
- It didn't work?
Well then I thought, what could have
washed out the letters?
Can we take a look?
I ended up using a small
mixture of sodiumh...
Thank you.
What does it say?
Lautrupvang.
Sounds like a location.
There is a Lautrupvang in Ballerup.
"There were more kids here."
We don't have any children,
who have gone missing.
Any abuse victims?
- A few unfortunately.
We think the child might have
been a Jehova's Witness.
Trygve?
- Sorry?
I had a Jehova-child in one of
my classes. His name was Trygve.
But I don't think there's anything there.
He seemed like a happy boy.
Do you remember when he was enrolled?
- One moment.
Trygve Holt left school in the
first grade. Parents' wishes.
Parents' wishes?
Can I take a look?
Says here the children didn't
show up for classes one morning.
The parents say the children have been
sent to Australia for a religious awakening.
I don't know what these
people are thinking.
I'm just trying to understand
what's going on.
The kids drop out of school one day
to go to Australia.
They don't return and the school
never follows up?
You don't have to put it like that.
- How else should I put it?
We acted in accordance
with the rules.
Children.
You said children.
So there's more than one.
Poul Holt, 4.b...
Must be Trygve's older brother.
Poul?
Poul Holt? You found your P.
Now lets find Poul and his brother.
They're fine.
They're both fine.
They just switched schools.
They think it's hilarious we found
their bottle after all these years.
Yes.
Can I see?
- No.
I'll tell mom and dad that you
have a magazine.
You're allowed to look at pictures.
Not with short haired girls.
Wearing makeup.
Are you sure,
you are allowed?
No...
- Well.
Look at the moon on these
belts and shoes.
Hey. Hello?
Hello.
- Hello.
Do you want a ride?
Um, no. We're fine.
We'll... just walk.
But it is so far.
Um, we're are used to it.
What if it starts raining?
- Yeah, that's fine.
Are you sure you don't want to?
We'll be home in two minutes.
I thought you had to leave.
- Yes.
But I left something in church,
and I thought I would...
... say goodbye to mom and dad
before I left.
Are you sure,
you don't want a ride?
You can sit in the front, if you want.
Do you want to sit in the front?
Okay.
No! No!
- Sit down.
Let me go!
- Sit down.
Stop! I want to get out!
Stop!
Thanks... Thanks.
You're welcome.
He's going to kill our children!
T-r-y-g-v-e. Trygve.
I have a listing for the parents.
Christian Holt, Ballerup Municipality.
Oh, hell...
He was found dead in his bed
with his wife.
They swallowed six months'
supply of sleeping pills.
Theory is that it was
a religious ritual.
Jehova's Witnesses don't have
any suicide rituals.
They don't have rituals at all.
They just sit around... and chat.
It's the pigs! It's the pigs!
- Settle down!
Fuck off! Get out.
Sit down.
- No.
Go sit down.
- What the fuck are you doing?
Go sit down.
- Sit.
Don't touch me.
- Be calm. Sit down.
What's going on?
- Don't talk to them, Trygve.
- Hey, we just want to talk.
- Trygve?
We want to talk about a letter
from your older brother that we found.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't have an older brother.
We know you have a brother.
- My older brother left.
He what?
- He left! I don't know him.
I don't where the fuck he is.
Now fuck off!
We'll wait.
Assad?
Can I see the letter.
Hello.
- Oh God. It's you, Christian.
The door was open.
Who else would it be?
Well I don't know.
It's good to see you.
It's so annoying.
I hate to sit alone, knowing...
It smells like rotting seaweed.
Salt water.
My big brother was there too.
We're both bound.
But he's alive?
- Yes.
I hear a loud noise.
All the time, the same noise.
Where's it coming from?
I don't know. A factory maybe...
A road, I don't know.
Just this continuous...
metal-sounding noise outside.
Can you hear it?
- What?
Can you heart it now?
Yes.
The man who took you. Do you
remember what he looked like?
I couldn't do anything.
He made me watch.
He grabbed his scissors.
He's dead.
Poul is dead.
There... Come on.
It's okay.
- He cut him.
He cut him with the scissor.
They said, if I talked about this
Jehova would punish me.
Viborg police, hello?
You will spend the night here.
Let talk more tomorrow?
So you didn't see,
who grabbed the child?
We'll take a look.
A dog walker saw a child being
forced into a gold-like car.
8 kilometers west of Skals.
- That could be anything.
An argument,
a parent making a joke...
I'll send a car to
check it out.
The bottle was found here. right there.
- Why narrow it to this circle?
We're excluding Kattegat.
The sea currents can't push it that way.
The boy said the perp spoke Norwegian.
Could it have come from Norway?
The Oceanographic Institute says all
west coast currents travel north.
It's a huge area.
- Well, it's only the coast.
It's difficult to throw a bottle into
the water from Herning city square.
Ringkøbing Fjord and Limfjorden...
- and Vadehavet.
Well, if you've got a boat...
- Trygve says there was no boat.
Could be a summer home along
the water, a boat house, a shed...
Department Q, this is Rose.
You're basing this on a 15-year old,
coming down off crystal meth.
Checking that area would cost 0.4% of our
entire budget. It's not going to happen.
Fine.
We'll continue with Trygve
and see if we can narrow it down.
There's also the noise Trygve heard.
We could try that lead.
Okay, listen. What are
we dealing with here?
Child goes missing and the parents
don't tell anyone at all.
That's very strange.
- Yes.
Aren't there sects that do all kinds
of things with children?
They're Jehova's Witnesses. It's...
God damn it.
And this happened this morning?
Wait a second. It's Viborg police.
A witness saw a child being forced
into a car near Skals village.
Guess whats up there.
A religious sect called
The Lord's Disciples.
We have to investigate this.
- What's the problem?
Viborg police will call us,
if they discover anything.
Marcus. Can you extend my
sick leave for a few days?
I have family in Jutland,
that I want to visit.
Right, you haven't seen them in a while.
Uncle Jørgen?
He's gotten problems with his eyes.
Aunt Esther?
- Her too. They've got cataract.
Well, shit.
Yeah, that's fucked up.
Well, that's terrible.
The Lord's Disciples.
They believe Jesus was born in Texas.
We're dealing with the
mentally handicapped.
It's good to have you back.
- Is that sarcasm?
I don't want to have this conversation.
People believe different things.
It's the same thing. Jesus born
in Texas, God up in the sky.
A guy in a cave believes he's a prophet
because a floating man told him so.
That's some psychotic shit.
- So I'm psychotic?
About this? Yeah.
We've known each other for years.
You've never tried to understand my faith.
I had hoped it would pass.
Like a bad habit.
Like smoking or homosexuality.
I have no idea, -
- whether I'm going to Paradise
to see my family when I die.
But I believe in something,
much bigger than us.
It makes me happy to think about.
Do you get that?
That doesn't mean I switch my brain
off, or grow a beard down to my waist.
Something bigger than us?
- Yes. It's not so strange.
A majority of the planet
share that sentiment.
So long as they're not killing each other.
- That's easy to say.
It's easy to speak the truth.
- Should I sign up for your religion?
Mind your blood pressure.
- You believe in a black hole, man.
That it's all meaningless.
No thank you.
With that attitude you'll never
come around to fried pork belly.
That's not funny.
Hello.
- Hello.
Assad.
- Lisa.
Good on you for coming all this way up.
But no one has been reported missing.
Right.
Is that a list of congregation members?
- Yes.
I've highlighted families
with young kids.
Here and here.
- Yes.
Right, thank you.
- Thanks.
Excuse me?
- What did you expect?
To question people without anyone
from the local present?
Yes.
You're a social worker?
- No, I'm a detective constable.
But we could talk
about your childhood.
We're police. Carl Mørck.
Can we ask you some questions?
Sure, what do you want?
We're asking around if anyone noticed
anything unusual these past days.
A witness saw a child being
forced into a car, -
- so we're here to see
if anyone saw something.
No, I haven't.
You've got two kids, Right?
Samuel and Magdalena.
Yes, they're not here.
- They're not here.
No they're, um...
In Sweden with their aunt.
Can we come inside
for a moment, to...?
We don't let strangers into our home.
Especially not his sort.
His sort...?
Because he's from the city?
You're disrupting our prayer.
I haven't seen anything. Bye.
That's not fucking normal.
You have to be quiet.
You have to be quiet. You have to...
No! How am I supposed
to be quiet?!
No, it was lower.
- As in deeper?
Lets try to lower the pitch.
What do you do,
when you're not on the job?
You're asking me?
Why do you ask?
You must have interests.
- I have all kinds of interests.
I'm going to get beer.
Well, she's... She's nice, Carl.
- Huh?
When was the last time
you asked out a girl?
It's been about a week ago now.
Something like that.
You haven't been with anyone,
since your divorce.
Here you go.
Thanks.
What's going on? Its a Wednesday night.
- It's Ascension Day tomorrow.
What?
When were Poul and Trygve taken?
Um...
May 11 2008.
- Would that be Whit Sunday?
He's taking the kids on Christian holidays.
- Carl.
Do a cross-country search.
And I mean everyone, even those...
Carl, Carl. Carl!
- Every religious holiday.
Carl, stop it.
Listen, December 2008.
Birgit Torp, a member of the House of Christ,
reports her two daughters missing.
The same night she calls back
to withdraw the report.
The whole family lives in Thailand now,
except the youngest daughter Cecilie.
It's as if she's vanished off
the face of the earth.
Rose found another.
- Right, and it's not the only one.
You asked me to look up
Elias and Rakel Steensgaard.
Yes?
Well you might say I've done that
and then some.
No, let me.
Yes. I have to button your...
Your eternal servant. Your servant.
Your eternal servant.
Hear our prayer.
We need You, oh Lord.
We need You.
I've looked at your magazine a little.
Look at it.
Look at it.
What do you think mom and dad
would say about his?
Look at me.
Only God can help you now.
Pray God that He shall come
and help you now.
Pray!
Your servant. Your eternal servant...
Your servant. Your eternal servant...
Stop speaking like your dad!
 I don't want to hear it. Again!
Our Father...
- In Danish, I said. Again.
Stop it!
Elias? We need to talk.
I have to go to work.
- You transferred everything to your account.
Your pensions, the company,
Rakel's parents. 670.000 total.
What's the money for?
Listen. We asked a neighbor to
check on your sister in Lund.
There weren't any children, Elias.
Listen.
Stay out of it! How the fuck do
you know all this? Who are you?
Easy. We just want to know what
happened to Samuel and Magdalena.
You don't get it! If he finds out
I talked to the police...
Stop, Elias!
- It's not his first time.
Last time only one of
the children returned.
Well, lets talk.
Speak!
I'm not talking to him.
They're here for the sake
of the children. Can't you see?
Come inside.
Both of you.
Carl.
- What?
The shoes.
So this is the children's room...
Magdalena sleeps here.
And Samuel.
We didn't even notice
they were gone, -
- until he called.
He called here?
- Yes.
And he spoke Norwegian?
- Yes.
Yes?
Yes, he said he had Magdalena
and Samuel, and that...
We had to cash out all our money.
He...
He knew exactly
how much we had.
How did his voice sound on the phone?
Was it young? Old?
No, we know him.
His name is Johannes.
You know him?
Yes...
Yes.
He visited the church a few
times the last couple of years.
He said that he was
a missionary for the congregation.
We had dinner with him two nights ago.
Right where you're sitting now.
Johannes is probably not his true
name. Do you have a photo of him?
No.
- How is the money being handed over?
I have to put it in a bag and
get on a train to Hamburg tonight.
He will call and tell me
where to hide the bag, -
- and then I have to get off
at the following stop...
When he has the money, he will release
the children somewhere familiar to them.
If we don't do as he says,
or tell somebody, -
- he will kill them.
But first he will make sure,
they can't enter Paradise.
He will... do things to them.
So... you can see why we
can't let you get involved.
Good.
You have hand over the money,
but we have to be there.
No.
- You can't. If he sees you.
He won't know we're there.
- No.
We won't do anything until we have an open
opportunity. This isn't his first time.
I said I won't allow it!
- He's killed at least one child.
I won't allow it.
The other children's parents
have let him get away with it, -
- because they put their faith in God
rather than the police. So I'll ask again.
Could you live with the fact that you did
nothing to save your children's lives?
Carl, Carl... Take it easy.
- Could you?
Easy, Carl.
Elias.
It's your kids.
Your call.
But Carl is right.
If we don't stop him,
you'll never see your children again.
No... No.
- Yes, Elias. Yes.
Yes.
- No.
We can't do it alone.
If something goes wrong...
... and you're to blame...
I promise we'll do everything we can.
There's 11 stops to Hamburg and we need
two plainclothes officers at every station.
To officers are on the train from Randers,
another will board along side Elias, -
- and we've got to cars along the
route, in case he slips past us.
That's 25 plainclothes officers.
True plainclothes. No windbreakers
or tight jeans.
I'll change to a blue suit.
We've got five and a half hours
to get everything in place, -
- those with the largest distance to cover,
should go now.
We need a helicopter,
in case we lose sight, -
- or if he's got someone helping him.
Will Carl and Assad be on the train?
- No, you'll take one of the cars.
Sorry, have I
missed something?
28 officers and a helicopter
for a single arrest.
This is kidnapping for ransom,
and we don't even know if he's armed.
We don't believe he's doing it for money.
- He's toying with the families.
He spends years to get to know them and
takes their children on Christian holidays.
He forced a 7-year old boy to witness
the murder of his own brother, -
- and we know of the siblings case in 2008,
when a 9-year old girl vanished.
He's not a kidnapper.
He's a serial killer.
If we lose him, we risk losing
one the children. Maybe both.
Anything else... before we head out?
We know he speaks Norwegian. Other
than that, this drawing is all we have.
We have no trace of him,
not today or back in 2008.
He called them from a stolen phone
that's been recovered from a ditch.
He's not stupid.
... a large scale aid-effort on
the African continent...
I'm afraid I have to go now.
- Yes.
See you.
- Yes.
This is Cop 1
Helicopter 1.
Are we in touch with Mørck?
Yes, this is Mørck.
- Did you check the route?
In some places we're further
than 4 kilometers away from the train.
You've got to say:
"Heli, Bravo, Whiskey, over and out."
What?
- Else he won't get it.
"Hello, Bravo",
what the fuck are you talking about?
They won't know you're addressing them.
It's very important.
"Heli, Bravo, Whiskey, over and out."
- Sure thing, Carl.
I was just kidding.
- Dial it down a little down there.
Right, sorry.
Can I help, Rakel?
- You can put the books down over there.
The train's arriving.
Elias? Are you ready?
- Elias?
The train for Hamburg will be
arriving shortly on track 1.
I repeat: The train for Hamburg
will be arriving shortly on track 1.
Can I help you?
- What?
You can get your tickets over here.
- Right.
Stop looking around.
Thanks... I'm glad you're
coming with me.
I don't get the kind of people
the police force accepts.
I know, it's shit.
Stop looking around.
There's a chance he's
getting on the train with us.
From this point we don't talk.
Safe travels.
Why do you think the bottle
found us, Carl?
I mean, why now?
Right before this goes down.
Otherwise we wouldn't know
about Samuel and Magdalena.
We might save two children because of a
letter, that was in the water for 8 years.
What are you trying to say?
That God sent us a message in a bottle?
What if it's true, Carl?
What if some force is watching us.
Standing by in car 23,
seats 33 and 34.
Leading us all towards good.
All we have to do is listen for it.
Quit that bullshit.
- Stop calling it bullshit.
Do you want to talk about elfs too?
If you want to be my friend then
stop being arrogant about my faith.
It's embarrassing. How can someone so
clever believe in something so stupid?
Your opinion on right and wrong
can't be taken seriously.
Okay.
You've got half of your life left
and you've already given up.
Don't you ever wonder
about life's mysteries?
No.
This is Cop 1.
The train is departing Hadsten Station.
He's calling.
How far are we?
- Two kilometers.
Yes?
We have contact.
- I see him.
Which car are you in?
- 22.
Go to the nearest restroom.
You have 30 seconds
to reach it.
I want to speak to them first.
- 30 seconds. Don't ask again.
Focus, Elias.
Go to the nearest restroom.
Where are we?
- Take a right next.
On the right side in front of you
there's a red handle, next to the door.
Pull it and force the door open.
- What?
Do it.
- I can't.
No more questions.
Do as I say. Now.
He's opening the door.
- What door?
What?
- He's opened the outer door.
He is not on the train.
- He is not on the train.
Which side, Pasgård?
- He opened the outer door.
Pasgård, on which side?
- The right side.
What should I do?
- Stand by.
Prepare to throw the bag.
- How do I know I'll get them both?
What do you mean? Who said
you'll get them both back?
We've made contact again.
We see Elias.
In 15 seconds you'll pass
a gate and then a forest.
Prepare to throw the bag.
- I want to see them first!
Elias, do you want to see
your kids again? Elias?
You're crazy. You're lying.
- Do as I say.
Elias?
Where's the next crossing?
- What?
Where's the next crossing?
- In two kilometers.
Cop 1. The train is entering the forest.
We won't have contact.
Prepare to throw the
bag in 3 seconds.
I will kill them if you
dont throw it... now.
Hello?
Elias!
Fuck.
He jumped!
A man has jumped off the train.
We don't have visual contact.
Carl!
What the fuck are you doing, Carl?
What?
God's protecting us, right?
Repeat, a man has jumped off.
- Fuck.
What does it mean?
- Be calm, Rakel.
Easy, sit down.
Carl? Carl, where are you?
Carl, come in. Where are you?
Elias?
Where are my children?
Ssh.
Do you see me now?
Elias?
Elias?
Carl!
Carl, get the helicopter.
Carl, where are you?
- Get the helicopter back.
What?
- Elias needs to go to the hospital.
Elias? Elias?
The police has not provided many
details about this operation, -
- which TV2 News has learned
went wrong, resulting in, -
- a 40-year old man jumping off
the train earlier tonight.
Speculations of a kidnapping
have been raised.
According to witnesses, the man's two
children haven been absent from school.
We have an exclusive on the
events taking place on the train.
The police are still reluctant
provide details in order to protect...
Why is it...? Why are
my children on it?
What?
You promised you would help.
You promised.
Now Elias is up there.
And my children...
I'll never see them again.
And it's your fault!
You did everything you could,
and she knows that.
How long have you had that, Carl?
What?
I've had many colleagues, who went
through unpleasant experiences.
You need help. You're shaking like
someone who's about to fall apart.
Oh.
I better see someone about that.
Okay.
... an improved infrastructure
will increase the possibility -
- of active and long term
investments, which naturally...
In the case of the two kidnapped
children, TV2 News has tried -
- to reach Carl Mørck, -
who did not wish to comment
on tonight's events.
Yes...
Look at me.
Look at me.
Are you watching?
Mhm, yes please.
Yes please, yes please.
Hey. Who are you talking to?
What's going on? Christian?
I think it's been taken
somewhere between '93 and '96.
Can you move in closer?
Look at her eyes.
- Yes.
Did Vejle police find any prints?
None that shows in the database.
Neither Denmark or IFAD.
Yes?
It's central. We have someone
who wants to talk to you.
He has information about the kids.
Do you want to speak to him?
Yes.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
- What do you believe in?
Who is this?
- Are you a religious man, Carl Mørck?
Yes.
You made a big mistake,
but I think you know already.
Yes... I know.
We should have left you alone.
- You're probably right about that.
I understand, that you're angry...
- The children will die now.
Listen...
- Both of them. This is your fault, Carl.
I think you care more about me,
than the children.
Hey... What do you want?
- Do you?
Tell me what you want.
- Maybe we'll see each other.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
He is here.
He's here at the hospital.
He's here. He's here!
Block all exits.
Block all exits.
Elias.
Mrs. Steensgaard,
he's waking up now.
Can we get a doctor...?
What the fuck is happening?
Where's the alarm?
Hello, can you hear me?
- Elias, are you there? Can you hear me?
I need some help over here.
- We need a doctor.
ICU, ward 3.14.
We need a doctor.
Elias?
- Yes, right away.
Hey.
- We have a pulse. 20.21.
Jo...
- Johannes? I know.
Lift.
What.
Here.
What's the pulse?
He was wearing scrubs?
- Mhm.
Yes?
- Carl, he's wearing scrubs.
Whats that?
- Carl, he's wearing scrubs.
Carl...
- Assad? Behind you.
Carl?
- Elias, stay with me.
Elias?
His going into cardiac arrest.
Do you need a priest?
Do you have a priest?
Yes.
- Can it be a regular priest?
Step away from the patient.
... 8, 9, 10.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
Come.
Hey, lock the door.
In there.
Pasgård?
Pasgård!
No, no, no...
Pasgård. Pasgård.
Easy, calm down. What's happening?
What should I do?
We need paramedics in the
parking garage. Level 3, now.
Carl, where the hell are you?
Carl! Carl!
Fuck, fuck!
He didn't do anything.
- Have you done nothing wrong?
We didn't do anything!
- God doesn't want you!
We didn't do anything!
Where the hell is he?
- That's the last trace of him.
After that he's gone.
Neither level 4 or in the basement.
- Have you checked the cars?
Where the hell are you, Carl?
There.
The convertible.
It's not registered
to any of the staff.
We have a registration number.
YJ 47 512.
Mia Hansen. The address
is half an hour away.
Okay. We want all of
you to listen to this.
Trygve, who was taken
8 years ago, -
- has identified the noise he heard,
when he was held captive.
It's the only lead right now,
that points to the children's location.
And I know that...
... there's a chance
we won't find them...
... or Carl alive.
Various factories have been excluded.
- A generator?
No, they run in a faster tempo
and have a more constant sound.
He might not remember exactly...
- Um...
You said a boat house, so
it's by the water, right?
Right.
- I think I know what it is.
Hey, Rose.
- The sound could be a windmill.
We're making a list of addresses,
where you can hear windmills.
It's more than 100 possibilities...
- Good job, Rose.
"Becca".
Rebecca Henriksen? My name is Assad.
I'm a police officer.
Did something happen?
- Can I come in for a moment?
My brother speaks Norwegian...
... but his name is Thomas.
Do you know where he lives?
- He travels a lot...
He's lived in Germany for a few years.
He's an executive.
He bought this... house for me.
He always took care of me.
We're looking for someone who kidnapped
two kids from The Lord's Disciples.
He's done it more
times before that.
Yes...
Always siblings who come from
very religious families.
It was in the news this morning.
- Rebecca...
Do you think it might be your brother?
Rebecca?
He doesn't live in Germany.
He has a place in
Denmark, by the water.
She says he has a boat house.
By the North Sea.
Begin with areas
close to windmills.
Continue along the coast
and go north west.
Don't worry about her now.
It's just you and me.
Do you know what I am?
You've done this before.
One thing at a time.
First answer my question.
Do you know what I am?
No.
I'm the son of the Devil.
I know how it sounds.
- No no...
I know how it sounds.
I don't believe I am the sole
chosen son of the Devil.
Because I'm not.
I'm one of his many sons.
We're his soldiers,
one might say.
The Devil's? Satan's?
So that's why you're doing this?
Hello.
He came to me,
when I needed him the most.
Hello, mom.
He made me strong,
when I was weak.
And then I was his.
From that moment on.
So you kill children?
To sacrifice them to him?
Does he get their souls in hell?
- This has nothing to do with children.
I understand how it might
seem like that, but it's not.
I found the purest way to
serve his sacred will.
Enough of that.
We need to beat God.
I take their faith away.
From the child, the parents, the family.
Everyone loses their faith,
and it spreads. And now...
And now...
I'll take away your faith.
You're wasting time.
I don't believe in God.
I don't believe in anything.
Johannes.
Johannes.
Listen, Johannes...
No, no,  no...
No!
- No! Do you hear me?
Listen to me.
Take me instead.
Take me instead, Johannes,
take me instead. Samuel.
You're rescuing people you've never met.
Of course you have faith.
Samuel.
I've never met anyone,
who's had as much faith as you..
Johannes, Johannes.
It's just a little boy.
He didn't do anything.
- Oh yeah?
He is just a little boy. So
why is no one helping him?
Take me in his stead.
Johannes, take me instead.
Samuel, look at me. Samuel!
No, no, no...
Johannes. Johannes!
Take me!
Do you wish God would make you
powerful enough to stop me?
Johannes... Get him up.
- I think you will remember this day.
Get him up. Listen to me.
You were here...
... and it changed nothing.
And God... never showed.
Johannes, what...?
Johannes?
Don't do this.
Take me instead.
Now you take this...
- Johannes.
And then you get your revenge.
Then you will be his,
then you will be free.
Stab me.
Stab me, and you'll be free.
You disappoint.
Now you've seen.
Now you must live.
I see a house on the water.
Assad, put down the machine.
Find Carl and the kids.
I have to land on the beach, Assad.
Magdalena. Magdalena!
Help me.
Find something over there to cut
these strips. Come, come...
Here, here.
Samuel! Samuel!
Hurry!
Just put me down here.
Please come back.
Samuel? Samuel?
- Samuel...
Samuel?
- Samuel...
Carl?
He's out there somewhere.
Are you ok?
- I'll stay here.
Hm, yes...
You and the others must go on living
in gratitude of all the things, -
- you got from Poul.
Short as his life might have been,
you received something very valuable.
You must live, Trygve and
trust that he is with God now.
Just as we are with God.
God reaches across the
border that is death, -
- giving a sense of community
between the living and the dead.
He gives us hope that life is
stronger than death. Amen.
Amen.
Lovely is the Earth!
glorious is God's heaven!
wonderous are the souls
pilgrimage!
Through the great
kingdoms on earth
we go to Paradise
with song.
Era's will come
era's will be passing
generations will follow
generations;
never will silence
the sound from the heaven
in the happy song of pilgrim souls.
The angels were singing
first for shepherds in the fields;
wonderful from soul
to soul, the words:
Peace on the Earth!
Lets go.
Thank you.
I've always looked at
those kids and thought:
"What a bunch of idiots."
Dreaming about everything.
They have no idea.
But perhaps that's alright.
