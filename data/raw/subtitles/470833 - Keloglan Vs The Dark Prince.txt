Damn!
What a handsome fellow I am!
You sent for Sirmaoglan (Goldilocks)
Here I am your Majesty
Sirmaoglan, after much thought we have
decided to give our Cankiz to you.
Oh, thank you, your Majesty.
But don't you think I should have to do...
...some task before I get the princess?
A task?
You know, you always give me
some impossible task, and I do it...
...and I put on a big show and then
I get the girl.
What's with all this task business...
How can we find a better man than you
to give our daughter to?
Don't say that, my Lord. There are...
...hundreds of cool young guys around.
I'm only a humble shepherd.
Oh no... We've looked round a lot.
There's no one as handsome, charismatic
and with such beautiful hair as you.
I know, your Majesty. I just wanted
to hear you say it.
Get going...
Your fiancé’s gone out looking for you
Wait up. Sorry, guys. This morning your
friend Sirmaoglan is a bit late.
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Let's get out the sweet-sounding saz.
Let's have some fun.
Let's brighten up your boring lives...
...with some music.
What on earth was that?
You wait here, Dogface... Keep an eye
on the sheep.
I'll be right back.
Hang on a minute.
Help...
Oh my god, that's her voice...
Oh my god.
Help...
I'm here, oh princess
I'm sorry, princess...
Aren't there any stones here?
Hang on, princess, I'm coming...
Stay back, buddy
I'm going to save the princess
Huh?
Help... Leave me alone, you beast
- Has this been going on long, buddy?
- I don't know. I just got here too
I'll let some air out of this guy
You can pick up the pieces afterwards
No way!
Me? Are you talking to me?
Sure am! I got here first.
It's my job to save the princess.
Help!
Just a moment, sweetie...
- What line are you in, buddy?
- I'm a part-time shepherd.
- A shepherd, huh?
- And proud of it!
And what about me? What do you...
...think I do? Look me over.
What do you think I am?
The King of Spades?
- I'm a prince - the Black Prince
- So...
...you must be the Jack, then.
Listen, pal... She's a princess... And
only a prince can rescue a princess...
...not a simple shepherd like you.
Get on your bike, and get out of here.
Hold on, princess, the Prince is coming.
My god! He's fainted.
Blackjack, you see!
You're not so tough, huh!
Help, help!
It's difficult
Hey! I'm coming, princess!
Help!
Your own stuff is always better...
Let that girl go, dragon!
Don't worry, princess... Now I'll rescue
you from the clutches of this damn beast!
Now I'll put out his fire!
Take that, you gas-powered lizard!
How about that huh?
Run, Sirmaoglan run!
You messed with my fiancé
You messed with me, ok...
But you shouldn't have messed up my hair!
If I don't chop your evil head from your
yellow body...
...my name isn't Sirmaoglan.
May I have your fire?
That's it.
Are you ok, princess?
Thanks to you I'm fine, Sirmaoglan...
You saved my life!
Not a problem, just part of the service.
Well thanks anyway.
Oh God!
I know we shouldn't do it before
we're married, princess...
But at least let me taste
your sweet lips.
It's not that! As far as I know that kind
of dragon has two heads!
Two heads!
Oh my God!
Our friend's right behind me, huh?
Dear God!
4 YEARS LATER
Keloglan are you crazy? Why are you
trying to kill yourself? Thank God...
...I saw you in time and came running!
Tell me, share your troubles...
We'll certainly find a cure...
Is it right for a tough guy like you
to die before your time?
Ah, Cankusoglu my friend... I want to die!
If you know of any ointment, bring it...
...and spread on my bald head...
used to be everyone's sweetheart!
Now I'll be a laughing-stock...
Let that heartless Cankiz mourn my death.
Yes, Keloglan you may be bald but
you're a human being.
Don't fret yourself.
Anyway, if hair was a good thing it
wouldn't grow on your backside.
- In the worst case, you can put on a wig.
- Come on, tell me, Cankusoglu
...what brings you here?
Tell me and let me die.
Let me die in peace.
The Sultan orders Keloglan to come
to the palace immediately.
Pigeons and men on horseback went
forth to find you.
And that's why...
You...
...you... post haste... um...
to the palace...
Keloglan ah... I'm bored with all this...
...fancy talk. I just wanted to say a
couple of words, and look what's happened!
Relax, Cankusoglu relax...
Say what you want... Anyway
I'll soon be dead.
Hey, Keloglan what do you mean,
what are you doing, Keloglan buddy!
Didn't you hear what I said?
I heard you, Cankusoglu. I heard
what you said.
You said the Sultan
sent a message...
For sure he's going to send more trouble
to entertain himself and his daughter.
Always the same story - when you
complete this task, Cankiz will be yours.
Every time, Cankiz finds some excuse...
...to get out of marrying me. God knows...
...there are no tasks left to do,
but still no girl.
I've got nothing but a flute
Greetings, young friends.
Greetings to you, Hodja. Are you well?
Praise be, my son. Life goes on
as you see.
That's fine, Hodja... But mind
what you're doing. Don't splash us.
Look, please... The water is dirty.
Our clothes will be ruined!
Ok, my son, ok...
Come on, come on, let's go.
Ok, Hodja, we're off. Farewell.
- Come on...
- Guys, boys.
For God's sake!
Hey Boys.
Can't you see what I'm doing here?
- What are you doing, Hodja?
- I'm making yoghurt in the lake
- Great, great! Good luck, Hodja!
- Come on, come on!
Do you think that amount of yeast will
turn the lake to yoghurt?
- What if it does, Hodja?
- What?
That's my line! When a man's telling
a joke...
...you should follow the script.
I'll teach you...
- Oh my God, the Hodja's gone mad!
- Come back... Get back here!
- What are you doing, Hodja?
- Get back here! Get back here!
Baldhead, your next mission,
should you decide to accept it...
...is to bring me the belt from the waist
of the doleful, dreadful giant...
What!
- Bring the belt, take the girl!
- Whaaat!
Yeah, sure, sure...
We don't want to do it...
Until we meet again, in another place,
on another adventure...
...we pay our humble respects.
What's this? Are you defying
the Sultan's orders?
Certainly not, your Majesty.
Some orders can't be obeyed.
How on earth can we
steal the belt from the ginormous giant?
In fact, that terrible giant will...
...eat these two guys for breakfast!
And I won't have to go through
all this stress any more.
What, Keloglan, don't you love me any
more?
Oh, I love you so much...
When we're married. I'll play the flute
for you every night, what about that?
Really!
I'll blow your mind!
- We accept the mission, your Majesty.
- What!
- Good for you. Well done!
- Yes, well done...
God have mercy
on your soul, Keloglan
You fool!
Your Majesty, my friend is speaking for
himself.
I want no part of it.
If you bring the belt, I will give you
a hundred bags of gold, Cankusoglu
In three days you will have the belt,
your Majesty.
Come on, we're wasting time, Keloglan.
Black Prince, please... On my tummy...
I greet you in the name of all the Vandams
Black Prince...
Where's your skirt, huh?
It gets in the way when I get on my horse
o prince...
So how do you do this greeting, huh?
Put your hand down...
The council of evil ones are waiting
o prince...
Fine!
Take off your watch. Greetings, men
- Greetings Soldiers!
- Greetings, sir!
- Are you well?
- We are!
Who the hell made up this royal greeting?
Who's that evil villain sitting
at the end of the table?
He's a local bad guy, o prince
Red Riding Hood...
Pinocchio...
The Tin Soldier...
Snow White and the seven dwarves...
Sinbad...
Hansel and Gretel...
It's time to put an end to this
exploitation, my friends...
You witch, how much trouble you went to
to prepare this poisoned apple.
Well, it's not that hard... You get
an apple, you squirt in the poison...
And look at comrade wolf's situation...
Look what a business it is for him just...
...to have it off with that young thing
in the red hat - it's a shame! A macho...
...wolf ends up looking like a monkey.
Hey man, why are you still wandering
round dressed up like a woman?
- I like it
- Dear God!
We should put a stop to this!
The whole world should know, comrades...
...that, there can't be any fairy tales
without us bad guys. We're the ones...
...who do the real work!
We live through all the adventures, the
action, the tension... and we bring it...
to life... OK, we bring it to life, then
what happens? They name all the fairy...
...tales after those sniveling good guys.
There's a message for you, o prince.
The sultan's set a new task for Keloglan-
It's serious... if he's successful...
...this time, Keloglan will get the girl.
And anyway, Keloglan...
- Ok, pal, I can read
- I'm sorry, sir...
Before this baldheaded fool becomes a real
problem, I have to put my sly plan into...
...action. After I marry the princess of
the Goodies kingdom...
...the whole world will be talking
about me...
...the tale of the Black Prince will be on
everyone's lips.
From now on the bad guys
will win the battles.
I've finished mine - do you need
any help, Balkiz?
Oh don't bother, Taskiz...
Oh, it's no bother, dear
We can have a lovely chat
Thanks.
How long does love last,
do you think, Taskiz?
I don't know, Balkiz.
Unrequited love never dies, but...
In fact you do everything to make him...
...notice you, you burn with love like
a lighthouse on a dark sea.
But no... instead of seeing the light
under his nose, he goes off looking...
...for love elsewhere... He prefers to be
an unseen light in a different sea.
If only he knew
how much I love him...
Hey, body, how can we find
this giant, huh?
My man is coming...
A frog... A frog.
Hello there.
Don't stop us, Balkiz, we're in a hurry
- You're in a hurry?
- We're in a hurry
- So where are you going?
- What's it to you?
I wonder if you got another
task from the sultan?
It's none of your business.
Actually, it's more of a
suicide mission.
OK Cankusoglan, if you're so scared
you don't have to come along.
I was about to commit suicide anyway.
You came and messed it up.
- Why would you kill yourself, Keloglan?
- What's it to you?
Lets go.
So it's none of my business, huh?
I'll come and put a spoke in your wheel...
...or my name's not Balkiz!
Get out of the way, get lost!
One day I got on the donkey backwards,
I went on my way...
That wasn't it. It was an English donkey.
If it was a Turkish donkey,
it would've been ok.
So, we're on the donkey, riding backwards
Tolga Han... What's new?
Ohh, you're the news, Keloglan.
The sultan was looking for you.
- You've got a new job, I hear.
- Don't we always have a new job, pal?
You sure do. Why do you think I never have
hair on my head, huh?
Hey, watch out, you!
Why are you standing in front of the door
like a sack of flour?
I'll head-butt you...
My God, Tolga... who are these characters?
How do I know? They look like
builders laborers to me.
And then I said to my wife.
Get out of my sight.
The Hodja is on form today!
- What's up Snow White?
- Let me go, Cankus, I've got business...
We're your business, baby
We want to order...
- But I haven't got this table
- Maybe, but you've got my heart.
Why are you doing this Snow White?
I've told you my conditions, Cankusoglan,
If you don't accept my dwarves, there's...
...no way we can get married.
What am I gonna do with all those
dopey dwarves? Let's adopt Ali Baba...
...and his forty thieves too, Snowy baby!
It won't be long now. I'm gonna
take you away from all this...
The sultan has given us a new job.
This time there's gold in it!
I'll put it into a house...
You want a house?
You want a car? You want a sedan chair?
Well, it's up to you, Cankusoglan...
One day a prince on a white horse...
...will come and take me away.
The hell with your prince on his white
horse! What's all this white horse stuff!
Listen, baby... Let's make a deal. Choose
a couple of good ones, and tomorrow...
...we'll get married, huh?
She's driving me crazy, buddy. I don't
know what she sees in these dwarves.
The hell with Sneezy and Dopey.
Here's a guy worth all seven of them...
...put together - she doesn't
even care!
My hair's wet again.
This long hair is a real problem!
Split ends, all wet.
How'm I gonna dry it?
I'll get it all cut off, for sure!
Cankusoglan, where are we going to find
this dreadful giant?
I've got it, Keloglan, I've got it!
What Cankusoglan?
The giant, Keloglan... The giant!
Don't talk rubbish, Cankusoglan
Is the sultan so stupid that we can...
...make him take the belt of a circus
giant instead of the real one?
How will he know, Keloglan?
They're both giants.
No way! This false bravery
doesn't suit us, Cankusoglan.
OK, but has your honesty been
rewarded up to now, Keloglan?
Up to now you've done all the Sultan's
tasks honestly and manfully like...
...a true hero. And where has it got you?
Hasn't Cankiz found some excuse...
...to get out of it very time?
Hasn't she, huh?
So what if you cheat them once, huh?
It's a good chance to teach Cankiz
a lesson, and pay her back for all...
...the trouble she's caused you!
But I don't know any fairy tales where
evil wins, Cankusoglan.
All right then... Don't let Cankiz win
with her nasty tricks any more... You'll see
She'll see the truth in the end...
She'll accept the love you offer...
Ok, how can we find this circus?
Look, this poster is 10 years old!
I know where this circus is.
If you take me with you,
I'll show you.
- Who are you, lad?
- My name's Tüysüzoglan.
Tüysüzoglan?
No hair!
None?
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is
the fairest of them all?
Ah, who's this? Guards, guards!
Find this creature, bring her here
and throw her into the dungeon!
As you wish, Princess Makarena.
Dear God, so many beautiful women
in the world!
You throw them in the
dungeon but there's no end to them!
Cankiz, you're the only one left...
...but your end is nigh.
You'll rot in the dungeons, all of you.
There'll be no one left
more beautiful than me.
Oh God - I swallowed my chewing gum!
- No... No... let me go... no... no!
- Move, get in there!
Send a couple of the ripest ones
to my room this evening, ok?
Princess Makarena, your brother the
Black Prince of the Vandams has arrived.
Don't thump those things on the
ground, pal - You're wrecking the parquet
We've just had it polished.
I've come to pay my
respects to you, Makarena.
- You are welcome, Black Prince...
- Let me kiss your hand, sister.
Listen, Necati - If you call me sister
in front of the soldiers again, I'll...
Watch it, sister - I'm not Necati
I'm the Black Prince. Black Prince!
Please don't touch the surface, you'll
leave finger prints.
Are you talking to me? To me?
I found the potion you wanted,
my Black brother
Really!
First you have to promise me that when
you marry Cankiz, you'll father...
...half a dozen children and spoil her
beauty by turning her into a 130 kg...
...baby elephant.
I promise, sister.
I promise, o queen!
Your mother is the queen.
I'm still only a princess.
Give me that, my dear sister.
You will be mine, princess.
So your father the sultan
won't give his daughter to the prince?
We'll see!
Sister... I am going to smash
that mirror, I'm telling you!
That's good, huh, my strong one!
Come on... Can we put this here?
Won't fit. Come on, Cankusoglu.
It's time to get going...
Listen, You're sure you know where this
circus is, aren't you?
Of course I'm sure.
Tüysüz, don't I know you from somewhere?
I don't know.
Never mind, let's get going. Come on...
- Come on, come on.
- So?
Yeah, come on!
- What are you doing, little man?
- I'm getting on the donkey.
You can't get on, Tüysüzoglu,
this donkey is a two-seater
- What do mean, a two-seater?
- If we put three, the police will stop us.
You're right. If they impound our donkey
what will we do? Come on.
- What happened, Tüysüzoglan?
- I've sprained my ankle, Keloglan,
- Oh God...
- I can't walk...
Ok, tell us where the circus is. We can
ask on the way and find it.
No way... I mean... You won't find it...
I'll have to come with you.
In that case, you get off, Cankusoglan.
Let Tüysüzoglan get on.
- What?
- Come on, get off. We're wasting time.
I can't believe this!
Hey, Cankusoglan, aren't you going
to help me get on?
Sure, sure - what did your last little
black boy die of?
Get out of the way!
- Tüysüzoglan, are you ok?
- I'm fine, never felt so good in my life.
Great, let's get going then...
Watch where you put your hands, ok?
Cool!
Black Prince, I think it's a trap...
Are you serious?
Say the word and we'll get them.
Wait, let's see what they want.
Good day, gentlemen. You've fallen into...
...the hands of Robin Hood, Prince of
thieves, and his men.
Soon my friends will be walking
around to collect our fee.
Please don't make a fuss.
Just give whatever you have.
And don't be too sad.
Everyone we rob gets a free copy
of the Tales of Robin Hood.
What did you say you were the prince of?
Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves...
It seems you don't read too many books?
You're a thief? And there's a book
just about you?
Yeah, pretty good, huh!
Whose name shall I write?
Prince... Black Prince.
My dear Black Prince. Hoping you
read more books. Robin Hood.
...- How do you invest your income?
- Our income?
- What do you do with your ill-gotten
gains? - Oh yeah,
I was going to tell you.
We give it all to the poor.
You give it to the poor?
We rob the rich and give to the poor...
we're not your normal bad kind of thief.
As you see, we are
good-hearted thieves.
That's why they put my name on the book.
Would they ever put...
...a bad guy's name on a book?
Of course not.
Did you hear that, guys?
Get them!
What a fate! I've been waiting here
for months...
...and no one has come
to rub the lamp!
Tüysüzoglan, are you sure this circus
is somewhere around here?
- Oh, someone's coming.
- Not far now.
How far we go?
Don't shout like that, huh! You'll scare
the donkey.
Stroke him, stroke him...
Keloglan, we're saved!
- What do you mean, we're saved?
- We're saved!
My God, we're saved! We really are!
We're saved!
I was so sad we left the tea pot behind
in our hurry this morning...
...Cankusoglan, it's good that we found
this tea pot, huh?
Oh, it tastes like honey. Keloglan.
It was time for a tea break. It takes
away all the fatigue of a journey.
But let's not waste time. Let's drink our
tea and get on the road.
It would be good to find
the circus before dark.
Tüysüzoglan, we'll get there before
nightfall, won't we?
Of course we will. The circus
is just over that hill.
Tüysüz, we haven't met before, have we,
at the market...
...or somewhere like that?
No, how could we have met?
Never mind. I'll draw some water from this
well. We'll take some to drink on the way.
Will you come and help me,
Keloglan?
What?
Come on, Keloglan!
Excuse me?
There's something strange about Tüysüz.
Why, Cankusoglan? Isn't it good
that he's helping us?
No there's something about him.
I'm sure I've seen his face somewhere.
But where? Oh, what's that?
There's a girl getting out of the well.
Hey, sister. Is the water in this well
drinkable?
I won't drink the water, Keloglan.
That girl put her head in it.
Ah, you wash one head in a big well.
No problem. It'll be clean.
Ok, but how are we going to get the water.
We don't have a rope or a bucket.
Easy! You hold my legs
and I'll dip the tea pot in the water...
...like this, and take it out.
No Keloglan... You're heavier than me.
You hold me and let me get
the water in the teapot.
I'll do it like this, ok?
All right, what I say is
We do it this way.
You hold me.
Why are you standing in my way, pal?
I'll plaster you on the wall...
...like a fly!
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, you, you cockroach!
Take a look at me! Hacivat!
Watch this. Take him out. Learn this move.
Call it the 'way of the crane'!
All right!
What's going on? What're you doing, buddy?
First let me see the goods.
Let me have the other thing.
Give it to me!
Who is Necati, by the way?
That night you left these
in my pumpkin coach.
They have 'Necati' embroidered
on them.
I borrowed them from a friend.
Maybe he had it done.
How can I help you, my prince?
Get Cankiz to drink this.
Where's this circus, guys?
It's gotta be round here somewhere.
Last time I saw it...
...it was right here.
When did you last see this
damn circus?
Not that long ago, only last year.
Or maybe the year before... or maybe...
...the year before that... That's all!
- Dear God!
I'm fed up with this!
Help!
Are you having us on, eh?
Oh God, don't do that, Cankusoglan!
Dear God!
- Greetings! Who are these guys?
- The Biriciks.
- The Biriciks?
- Yes. There's nothing to worry about.
Keloglan, I've heard that these Biriciks
are very friendly, warm, loving people.
Yes, they do look friendly.
Well done, pal.
Cankusoglan, where are you going?
This guy must be chief of the Biriciks.
Let's introduce ourselves to him.
If they like us, I don't think there'll.
Be any problems... And maybe they...
...know where our circus is.
Good thinking, Canküsoglan.
Let's do it.
Greetings, my lord.
I greet you on behalf
of my colleagues.
Bravo, well done!
Cankusoglan, the chief likes you.
- Oh my God!
- What's going on, Keloglan?
This evening there's a dance competition
with a flying carpet for a prize.
Ha! All the preparations are for
that occasion!
Flying carpet, huh! Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?
Oh no, buddy - I'm not thinking
that at all - no way!
Why not, buddy? There's a flying carpet
to be won - just think, man!
I'll dance with you, Keloglan!
Are you a good dancer, Tüysüzoglan?
Have you realized?
There's no women here.
Are you crazy, pal? You could have
broken my head!
Wait, wait! Cankiz! Don't! Stop!
Cankiz, it's me, the Black Prince! Stop!
Honey, didn't you let your hair down so
I could climb up the tower?
No... I just got out of the shower...
It's hard to dry my hair...
...so I thought I'd hang it
out of the window.
So... When did you grow it so long?
It's a hair extension.
Today my father...
...gave a new task to Keloglan.
- Yeah, I heard...
This time it's serious. I can't
get out of it. If Keloglan comes back...
with the giant's belt, I'll have to
marry him. And we'll be parted.
Nothing's finished till I say so.
I've got a great plan! Up till now...
...they always said we won't give our
daughter to a prince.
But this time the sultan will
send you to me with pipes and drums!
I miss you so much, Black Prince!
I miss you too, Cankiz.
Stop stop, what are you doing? Someone
will see.
Come here.
I've brought you camomile tea, princess...
Oh how kind, Cinderella!
By the way, what's the time?
Five past twelve, princess...
OK, you may go.
Pesky Cinders.
Good night, princess... Sweet dreams...
Keloglan, come on, get up, let's go.
We won the flying carpet!
Please help me, Tüysüzoglan,
rescue me from these people.
Come, come...
How did you escape from them?
It seems I'm not their type.
- What type are you?
- Never mind!
Gentlemen, why don't you help,
for God's sake, instead of standing there?
Oh, my daughter.
Wake up, wake up now.
Leave her to me...
- Oh my beautiful daughter, wake up.
- Let me try, your majesty.
We need to send for the prince with the
white steed your majesty.
I won't give my daughter
to a foreign prince.
OK then, let her sleep forever
like a log.
Guards, send the word around.
Wherever he is, let this foreign prince...
...bring his white steed and come
immediately!
If I remember right, the kiss from a
fearless hero will do instead...
...of a prince with a white steed
or so I read.
A fearless hero?
Where are you, Keloglan?
For God's sake, come quickly!
- This carpet doesn't fly!
- There must be a button somewhere.
I think we probably have to
say some kind of magic spell...
We made a decision, little man,
not to listen to your opinions any more.
- We should take the donkey.
- Hang on, Keloglan... Wait a bit!
You've got the latest flying carpet...
...and you want to put a donkey on it!
- The latest model, huh? But it won't fly!
What if we run it down a hill?
Come on, damn you! Let's get going
before these Biriciks wake up.
Carpet, carpet, fly away home, Your house
is on fire and your children all gone.
- He's dreaming
- Stupid, stupid!
Dear God! I think we're flying! Hey!
1... 2...
...3... 4...
Attention!
Great - don't forget behind the ears -
They must be whiter than white!
All right! I like this carpet business!
We're going fast! In half an hour...
...we'll find ourselves at the circus.
In fact, if we throw Tüysüzoglan off
we'll go faster.
- No, no, don't do that.
- What do you want?
We've already wasted too much time.
Come here!
- What's going on? What're you doing?
- The carpet's gone crazy!
There must be turbulence!
When you were sleeping this morning,
I did something to it.
What did you do?
I should kill this Tüysüz!
- I swallowed a fly.
- Close your mouth!
Yes, my friend.
- What is this now?
- The circus!
Ole!
Come on, get moving!
- Welcome.
- Is there a giant in this circus, pal?
Of course... Come in, come in!
- He's coming, the giant's coming!
- He's really coming!
Thanks, Tüysüz...
Thanks to you we found the circus!
Ladies and gentlemen... On stage
before you is the great Devriye!
Oh! Our daughter's sleeping like a log.
What are you doing? You'll wake her up!
I wish they could!
- Respectful greetings, your majesty!
- Who are you, my son?
I'm the prince with a white scarf!
I hear there's a young sleeping princess
who needs waking up.
I have to kiss her and wake her up. This
must be her, I guess!
- Stop, stop. What are you doing?
- But your majesty.
God forgive you!
We need a prince with a white steed,
not a prince with a white scarf!
A white steed?
When the fax arrived,
the paper got stuck at that point -
I couldn't read it, and I thought...
...what's the use of a white scarf?
- I'll throttle you with this white scarf!
- I guess I misunderstood you.
Ah, I die, Horatio... This dreadful poison...
...is pressing on my soul.
Bravo! Bravo!
This woman is wonderful!
So tell your mother to come and ask
for her hand in marriage!
I told you we couldn't be real heroes
by trying to cheat!
What's the name of this play?
We were really moved! Weren't we, friends?
Did you hear, guys? It was Hamlet!
In fact Hamlet is a male character...
but I play the role in man's clothes.
Actually, because I'm the only actor
in the circus, I play all the roles.
Well, in fact we're here on business,
that's why we're bothering you.
- On business?
- Important business?
We are here to desire the honor
of your presence at the sixty-third...
...celebration of our Traditional
Theatre Festival.
- I don't believe it! Are you serious?
- It's true!
Cankusoglan! What festival? What theatre?
If you accept this invitation...
...we will put our names to a project
with a very important cast.
Of course I accept!
It's an honor for me!
- The honor is ours, my friend!
- What honor, huh?
But we want you to play all your roles
in men's clothes, and to wear...
...men's clothes during the festival
to make it more convincing.
Like Viola in Shakespeare's
Twelfth Night!
Our play will be just like that! Keloglan,
This Shakespeare wasn't a low-born...
...character, was he?. In that case,
We'll be in trouble with the Sultan.
- Look into it, then.
- Why?
Ah, the beautiful Viola! She dresses
as a man just to be near the man she...
...loves, and no one notices for
the whole play!
I could play that role very well,
believe me!
I'm sure you could. Anyway you...
Just a minute...
Is there really a story like this?
The girl dresses as a man just to be
near the one she loves?
Well, she loves him so much, what
can she do? But the man doesn't know...
...the worth of the love she offers him.
You see that, huh!
I mean, what a wonderful story, isn't it!
So what happens in the end?
- Aah, you'll find out at the festival...
- Sure.
Come on then, we've got a long
way to go. Come on, guys!
You're up to more tricks,
aren't you, Cankusoglan?
I'm updating the project a little, pal.
The sultan wants the giant's belt...
We're taking the giant himself!
We'll have Cankiz right where we want her.
Yo! Let's see!
Come on!
- She won't wake up!
- Your majesty, your majesty!
Keloglan is coming!
- Has he got the giant's belt?
- Yes, he has.
But it seems he forgot
to take the belt off the giant first!
Cankus, sir! Why are these people
running away in fear?
They're very ex cited to see a big star
like you... I mean...
I think these poor people are
running around trying to find pen and...
...paper to get your autograph
- Oh, how sweet they are!
But listen dear... Stick to your role -
try not to look like a girl!
Sorry... These chains are really nice!
They make my role seem...
...more tragic!
They do, don't they!
But Cankusoglan, I don't feel happy.
I always say there's no bravery...
in lying and cheating.
That's what you think, pal... Look at the
sultan! He's come to the gate to meet you!
Devriye, dear... You're sure this
Viola story has a happy ending...
...aren't you?
- Of course I'm sure!
It doesn't feel that way to me...
What the hell is that?
- It's a white horse, o prince!
- It's got grey hairs, pal!
Open your mouth, quickly!
Kiss her before the effect of the potion
wears off and she wakes up.
Do it man!
No, your majesty. I don't trust her.
She's pretending to be asleep just so
she won't have to marry me, isn't she!
No, son, there's no trick!
Look...
...she's fast asleep.
- She can't hear a thing.
- So what are we going to do?
You'll kiss her and wake her up,
Really!
It shall be done, your majesty.
Kiss her now - wake her up!
Go get her, Keloglan!
What are you waiting for, son? Do it!
Just a moment - for the bad breath...
Take two.
Cankiz is now yours, Keloglan.
What! Disgusting! Get away from me,
wretch! Oh, daddy!
You've come late, you've come late!
I know, get out of my way...
Keloglan has already kissed the
princess and woken her up.
What! What are you saying?
And he caught the dreadful giant, and
brought him as a prisoner!
But, but that's impossible.
Something strange is going on here.
What?
- You see?
- Who the hell is this Keloglan?
It's just between us, but he's saying
bad things about you.
Dear theatre-lovers, I would like to...
...thank you for inviting me
to your festival.
And then I grabbed the giant by the neck...
The size is not important, I said...
...It's what you do with it that counts!
You should have seen it, girls! The huge
giant was trembling with fear.
What a beautiful smile!
What's your name?
- Have you got a sister, Birgül?
- What?
What? What?
Oh no, Snowy... Snowy baby!...wait!
You've got it all wrong.
- Snow White, have you seen Tüysüz?
- You men are all the same!
What?
Cankusoglan!
Have you seen Tüysüz tonight?
No, I haven't seen him tonight.
Dammit. Where has he got to, that guy?
- I'm feeling really down.
- Yes...
...I'm a woman... My name is Viola.
And I'm in love with you, Duke Orsino.
Tüysüzoglan, what're you doing here alone?
Why don't you come and
enjoy yourself with us?
No, no, I'm fine.
- Ah, oh, are you crying?
- No.
Look at this pebble.
Look at the
beautiful shape!
You have it.
Take it!
If you have a lover one day
you can give it to her as a gift.
- You'll win her heart.
- Thank you.
I was watching Devriye in the play.
The writer told a wonderful story...
The main character Viola puts on
men's clothes to be nearer to the...
...man she loves but the man
doesn't know it.
In fact the man is in love with another
woman who doesn't love him.
He can't see the love under his nose.
How stupid!
And...
But the girl - to make the man she...
...loves happy, and to ease his pain...
...is helping him to win the heart
of the woman he loves.
- Amazing! What happens in the end?
- In the end. I haven't seen the ending.
I was worried about you,
so I came looking.
But I'm sure in the end, the man will
realize who really loves him.
Who the hell is this Keloglan?
I want to see him!
What's this? Come on!
Oh, my God!
- Let's get going. The real giant's come.
- We can see him, buddy.
My Devriye. My God! Devriye!
My Devriye! Thank you, God!
I've found you at last!
We'll never part, Muharrem, we won't!
Wow! It seems the love of giants is
extra large too!
Keloglan's giant was a fake!
Hey, where are you taking the girl, pal?
Where's he going?
No problem... It's the prince on the
white horse.
Keloglan...
We're in real trouble now!
It's all finished... I'm finished!
Don't give in to despair, buddy.
Our situation's not that bad.
For sure we can find a way out...
Have you got a light?
We deserve this... The bad guys lost.
In fact the best way out is this.
Face the truth and die.
Keloglan, before I die I want to confess
something to you.
So confess then.
Well, in fact... The truth is...
You know Tüysüzoglan... Well, I...
- Keloglan.
- Yes, Cankusoglan...
What's up?
Have you come up with a new sly plan...
...that will put us in a worse situation
than we are in now?
Are these grey snakes deadly
or harmless?
Grey snakes? Are they deadly?
My friend, you just head for
that Tüysüz over there.
Hey, friend! The one with no hair.
Go for him.
Go get him, the one with no hair...
That one there, yes, him!
Yay! We're saved! Keloglan, some
people are coming! We're saved!
I don't believe it!
Hey, my friend, come here... Don't go!
Bite me first! I want to die
quickly! My friend! Hey!
You saved our lives. We're very grateful.
In fact I'm not so grateful.
We were dying gracefully... Now
I'll have to...
...make suicide arrangements
Keloglan, I think they're going to
give a concert or something, somewhere...
- We going to play at a wedding.
- Ah, how nice! Whose wedding is it?
The Black Prince and Cankiz.
- So where is the wedding?
- Where do you think? The Vandam castle!
Why don't you go and rescue Cankiz,
Keloglan?
What?
Well, up till now all the tasks you've
done were just games! But now...
...there's a real task in front of you!
At last a real task that will
make you a genuine hero!
Don't talk rubbish, buddy... How can we
pass the guards at the Vandam castle?
I've got a plan!
So we're back where we started...
Esteemed guests!
Now we invite
the bride and groom on to...
...the dance floor. Applause please!
To accompany the dance, we bring you
the Biriciks!
- How happy I am!
- Of course you are...
I wish mum and dad and the rest of them
were here...
Forget about them...
In my tale there's no
place for fat-bellied sultans and...
...their wrinkled wives.
- Your tale?
Welcome to the tale of the Black Prince,
baby! Have an apple?
- Come on, let's go dance!
- No, no!
- Come on, let's show off a little...
- I like it better here.
Ok, I'll dance on my own then.
What is this?
Hey, leave the girl alone!
Keloglan!
Hold on, princess, I'm coming!
Leave that bald guy to me!
I'll take care of him myself!
Stop it! Stop following me!
What are you doing here, Keloglan?
Don't worry, princess, don't worry!
You're safe now!
For God's sake! Who told you to come
and rescue me? I don't want
...to be rescued!
- Huh?
- But... I don't understand!
- There's nothing to understand.
I love the Black Prince, not you!
But all those tasks! All those adventures!
They were all to entertain my father...
I always prayed that you would die...
...in one of them, but it didn't happen.
My God!
Am I dead?
Balkiz... This stone... Tüysüzoglan...
Were you Balkiz all the time?
Why did you do it?
To be near the man I love!
- What a weird thing to do!
- Weird?
Open your eyes now and
see how much I love you! I threw...
...myself in front of the arrow for you.
Do you think Cankiz would do this?
I love you with a true and unselfish love.
You may be bald and vain
but I love you.
- My Keloglan...
- Yes?
Ah, I can see a hair!
Is my hair growing back?
My God!
Thank God, my hair's growing back!
- What did you do, Keloglan?
- It's ok, the roots are still here.
Do you see, Keloglan... True love
conquers all.
- Even baldness!
- You mean Sirmaoglan, I think!
Stand up, Keloglan.
I want to see your
face as you die.
There's no more Kelolglan...
You can have Sirmaoglan, ok?
It doesn't matter to me...
Did I pay good money for you?
You get in my way in every adventure!
Well, it's not easy to be a popular
fairy tale hero.
Don't envy me... Try hard,
you can be one too, pal.
Arrest that character!
You've got two hairs on your head -
Does that make you a man?
Do you think you're a man,
you mini-skirted foreigner?
The split looks good, but you need to
get your legs waxed, Neco!
Are you going to teach me about hair?
Let me go! Do you know who I am?
I'm an important person! I'm... Just a minute...
I have connections...
Hang on a minute, I want to say something.
What are you doing? I have things to do.
I know this Milton style of fighting...
I don't want to use it on you, but...
What's all this?
Hey, it's ok, pal! I'm fine here!
You get on with your fighting, ok?
And watch out for those swords!
Thanks, thanks a lot!
I'm Cankusoglan.
Nice to meet you.
We've come to the second apple. Yes.
So we've come to the end of the tale.
The end of Keloglan's tale, but the start
of the Black Prince's!
I've got four special moves...
You are trying in vain, Keloglan. In this
tale, I'm the victor!
The bad guys win this one!
My name is not Keloglan...
It's Sirmaoglan, Necati.
- Who's Necati?
- The Black Prince...
You see what happened!
I'm the winner! The princess of the
Goodies has chosen me!
The evil prince
has got the good princess.
I loved you the first moment I saw you,
Cankiz... Because I thought that you...
...also loved me I got into a lot of dangers
for you...
...but you chose to play with me.
So, in fact, you are a very bad princess,
Cankiz!
What do you mean? No, no!
What sort of book would be called
Black Necati?
But my prince, it will be so appealing to
children. They'll love it!
In fact, it's not a bad idea!
Black Necati on holiday. Black Necati on...
...a picnic. Black Necati starts school...
Black Necati's circumcision...
Black Necati on the way to the chateau...
And even Black Necati and his best friend
Kil Bil...
Are you having me on?
