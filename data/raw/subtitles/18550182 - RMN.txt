to your sites
We'll run the line
Turn off your phones!
- Are you replacing me?
- Yes, I'm working the hooks.
I'll take care of it.
Stop chatting!
. Get to loading
Auner!
You're not on a break.
Help them unload the sheep
- Get to work!
I have an emergency.
- Dirty gypsies, you're all lazy!
 - What?
Companies with more
than thirty employees
Can obtain an additional
56,000 from the European Union
- And our shares?  
- They'll increase proportionately.
However, rental equipment 
will be taken into account
We get any other calls?
Someone from Toplita called yesterday
When I told him he had to leave,
 he hesitated
I'm afraid Traian will leave us too
How is his son?
He is still under treatment 
with his mother
All these papers are useless
If we do not apply
 for the 136000 grant.
It will be hard to find five qualified
 workers before the deadline...
What if we don't announce the salary?
We would get a lot of calls for nothing
We just have to do 
another round of ads
Without specifying the salary,
just “overtime is paid double.”
What should I tell the recruitment
office about the three workers?
Gain us some time, 
and send the new ad
We'll see later.
Okay.
Good morning!
Morning!
- Good morning!
- Good morning. 
- Has the priest arrived?
- Not yet. 
Can I paste another ad?
Go on, the door is open.
- Thank you.
- Good bye. 
I brought you a beer.
- Hello.
- Good Morning.
- Are you coming to the rehearsal?
- I will try. 
You still have that bike?
Do you want to drive it
 that bad?
Hello, can I post an ad?
- Not job candidates yet?
- Not really.
- Any news about your cousin?
- He found a job in Stuttgart.
- Can he take Mara?
- He lives in a truck container.
Since her mother lives in Italy,
I take care of Mara and the elderly
- Send her to rehearsals!
- I won't stop her!
- Hi, Mara?  
-Hi.
- Do you rehearse at home? 
 - Yeah.
She rehearses on her smart phone!
Not true.
My grandfather makes me go
 to our church choir
You can do both.
- We'll practice at school.
- I asked him.
Coming.
Can I?
-There's a call.
- Thank you.
"BEWARE OF WILD ANIMALS"
This is better, right?
Thank you, Father Otto
- Starting Monday, we'll practice
 at the school.  - Okay.
Someone will come to take
 the musical instruments
Thanks.
- Are you passing by "Mercuria Ciuc"?
- Hop in.
Good Morning. 
Papers, please.
- Where do you come from?
- Münster, Germany
Does everyone else?
Except for him, he's from Regensburg
- "Auner"?
- Yes.
Hey, lower the sound!
Safe travels.
Thanks.
Behave, Kaiser!
Let's keep "Qualified bakers, 
experience required"
"Transportation is secured"
And add 
“Overtime hours paid double.”
Double. That's it.
No, we will not put the salary.
That's all, yes.
Is that available online now?
I'll fix it immediately
Thanks.
 Thank you. 
Hey you, how are you?
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you call?
I broke my phone.
Take off your shoes.
How's Rudi doing?
Same as always.
Does he talk?
No.
- Have you seen a doctor?
- I consulted one, yes.
It's useless to push him.
He'll talk when he's ready.
Did you buy him 
anything for Christmas?
I didn't have time
I'll get him something from here.
Rudi?
Turn it off. Papa is here.
Come.
That's enough, it's late.
We'll finish this game.
Will you take him to school?
- Doesn't he go alone?
- Not since he got scared.
Rudi.
What did you see 
in the woods? Tell me.
Not before bed!
I wasn't talking to you!
It's okay, I'll take him.
It's all right, OK
Your father is back home.
Nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Let's go, bedtime.
He doesn't sleep alone anymore?
No.
You're really not helping him.
He wets his bed if he sleeps alone
Did you pass by Father Otto's?
No, I came right away
You should, he's not feeling well.
Good night.
Was he the one who scared you?
What are you doing there, man?
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Did you come here to steal?
Huh?
I don't want to see you here again!
You're scaring the kids.
Asshole.
Come on, let's go.
Here's your bag.
From here, you'll go on your own.
Come on, I'm watching you.
Let's go!
This way, good!
You could've caught it.
Go, little girl.
Hey!  What is this?
If I hear you say that again,
you're doing push-ups.
 -You're back?
-Yesterday evening.
Shall we go for a drink later?
How are you, Matthias?
Are you home, or is it just Christmas?
I don't know, we'll see
- Is your contract for three years?
- Two years.
Mathias, I'm sorry for asking this,
 you just arrived,
But could you slaughter my pig?
The man who succeeded you
 did a horrible job
I left my tools before I left.
A good knife, that we can find.
- When?  
- Today, if you can.
- I'll try.
- God bless you.
Only four for Bradu, okay?
- What about Toplita?
- Two boxes.  Thanks.
If you don't want them, tell me.
I have an offer for them, in Navodari.
Okay. 
We'll take these three candidates.
And I hope to find two more
 in the area.
- What's the deadline?
- The 7th.
January?
Are you really hoping to find bakers,
during the holidays, with that salary?
With foreigners, you can't be sure.
And you have to house them.
How can you not be sure?
They are more serious and less paid 
than our country's workers
- Asians? 
- Yes.
We never work with Africa ​​at all.
- We'll think about it.
- And the three, when will they arrive?
Two of them will arrive tomorrow.
They're already in Bucharest.
Yeah, let me call you later.
Excuse me.
-Hello.
-Hello.
- You've lost weight, huh!
- Clothes make it seem like it.
Is there a smoking area here?
- Nobody smokes anymore.
- Really?
- But you can smoke.
- Won't they fire you?
- Who?
- The managers.
I'm the manager.
Is all of this yours now?
It's the owner's,
 but I'm in charge of things.
- You said you'd never come back.
- I had something unexpected.
Why did you call me?
What did we agree?
It's an emergency for Rudi.
I'd like Tanczo to check him.
- Why don't you call him?
- He changed his number.
It's not me you want to ask then.
How is that?
Tanczo and I got divorced,
two years ago.
I thought you knew.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
And Tanczo?
No idea. He's in Hungary, I think.
He's gone, in any case.
What's wrong with Rudi?
I don't know, he no longer speaks.
Something is off.
So, are you staying?
Maybe, I don't know yet.
- Is there work here?
- Not really.
Will they reopen the mine?
No. 
Maybe a job at the forestry?
The forestry...
Or if you are interested, 
we're looking for bakers
And what's the salary?
Minimum wage. 
But overtime hours are double
- Double?
- Sorry, I mean paid double -
I'll think about it.
Not for too long, the offer won't last.
Do you still live there?
I took my parents' house.
I renovated it.
You renovated it...
- I have to go, I'm cold.
- Okay, see you.
Bye.
Papa.
Are you okay?
Come on, let's get you up.
Let's get out of here.
Don't move, okay?  I'll be back
Here, some Coliner. Ten drops,
for cerebral blood circulation.
You have to do tests in the city.
I can't do anything more than that
Tests?
Yes, for diagnosis.  At his age,
there could be several reasons for this.
- He must stop milking his sheep.
- He must stop...
He's getting old, he has to accept that.
- Someone's got to take care of him.
- Steffi came to visit.
He needs someone around every day.
To give him his pills, 
to wash him, to stay with him.
- Do you know anyone?
- In the village?
They all work abroad
- There's less and less people here.
- Yeah.
He has trouble expressing himself too. 
More than usual.
That's possible.
- Could it be hereditary?
- What?
Difficulty expressing oneself.
Not really.
Because the Germans here
were marrying each other.
- But you speak well.
- Not me. I was thinking about Rudi.
He doesn't speak?
Not anymore.
In this case, you have to see a doctor.
Here's the prescription.
Take him for a checkup 
at a neurologist in Cluj.
Thanks.
Serve yourselves.
Thanks.
- I don't drink...
- You're so big now!
- Did the pig have some?
- Mom gave him.
I put a little in his bread.
Cheers!
Here we go.
- Hold it.
- I won't touch that.
You hold it.
Give me the knife!
Arm first!
Hold him.
Put him down!
Hold him tight!
Put him down!
Hold him!
It's me, don't be scared.
What the hell are you doing here?
I slaughtered the priest's pig, 
and he gave me a piece.
So?
I wanted to get you some.
Are you fasting for Christmas?
Me? No. 
But I don't eat meat anymore
- You don't eat meat anymore?
- No.
For Christmas, I mean.
.I mean for Christmas
I watch movies.
Movies?
Yes.
I don't know...
It's hard to be alone on Christmas.
Aren't you with your family?
Not me... I was thinking about you.
Me, I'm with Kaiser.
With Kaiser...
I wanted to tell you...
I can't work as a baker.
OK.
- Might as well do nothing.
- Okay.  Go home
I'm in no hurry.
Rudi's already asleep.
- Your wife's got to be waiting.  
- She's not waiting for me.
Doesn't matter. Go to sleep.
- I'm not drunk 
- Maybe, but...
Also, don't come to my house
by the backyard again.
By the backyard?
Come by the front door,
or don't come at all.
We'll talk tomorrow. Go home
Good night.
Good night.
Rudi?
What are you doing?
We're going to school.
- Won't he go alone today?
- No.
He will.
We went together yesterday, that's enough.
He's afraid.
Rudi, don't be afraid.
- Don't hit him!
- Of course not, are you crazy!
Rudi!
Rudi.
Come to papa.
Get down.  
Tell papa about what you saw.
"Something bad".
- "Something bad?"  
- Yes.
Did you take him to the doctor?
Which doctor?  
During the holidays?
I talked to the priest about it,
 we'll visit him Sunday
The priest...
Rudi, come down. Papa will come
with you. We'll take the gun.
I'll go fetch it, come down.
Come on.
Rudi.
Look.
Do you see the bear?
In the bushes.
We'll just give it a big scare,
so it doesn't scare you anymore
What do you think?
Come on.
Hello!
Welcome!
 Please, come in.
Alick.
 - Hi
- Mahinda.
Please take a...
Morning.
Mahinda.
- Hello, Csilla.  
And Alick.
- Hi, I'm Alick.
- Csilla, nice to meet you.
You too.
Welcome.
And this is Mrs. Denise, she's the owner
- Hello.
- Hello. 
Sorry to bring you here
 just before Christmas
Work before all.
 - Where are they from? 
- Where are they from?
From Sri Lanka.
Give them a quick visit, 
they must be tired.
We'll teach them the ropes tomorrow
- Is there a final signature?
- We'll finish the procedures.
Follow me.
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

Happy Holidays.
Hello, Mr. Baciu.
Bravo!
Happy Holidays!
Merry Christmas.
What a beautiful song!
Hello.
Well done, that was amazing!
Thank you for the gifts.
- Say thanks for gifts.
- Thank you.
They're from Santa Claus.
- Matthias told him he didn't exist.
- I don't want him to be deluded.
A shame!
Mrs. Baciu, can we rent your rooms
 to our new workers?
Certainly.
- There's a wood stove.
- They need wood.
- Wood. Got it.
- "Wood".
Can Csilla come today?  
It's urgent.
- We'll be waiting for you.
- Thank you.
- Happy holidays.
- See you later.
Come see.
Bring the stick back here.
Plant it well!
Hide it under the leaves.
Leave the meat visible.
If you drink this, you will die.
It's full of dirt.
Because of the mine.
But it's still water.
It seems that Papa Otto's 
ancestors are buried here
They arrived from Luxembourg.
About 700 years ago
You know where that is, Luxembourg?
Next to Germany.
I'll teach you how to purify water.
Do you know what this is?
Birch.
In the spring, I'll show you
 the edible plants.
Taste it.
It's not tasty,
 but it's drinkable water.
If you know how to make a fire 
and boil water, you'll be able to live.
But to survive, you need  
one more thing.
To know how to fight.
It's simple.
You must not have any pity.
Our invaders, did they have any pity?
That's life.
If you have pity, you will die first.
And I want you to die last.
Let's go.
Go wash your hands.
They gave them beautiful gifts 
at the factory
By the way,
Did you talk to Csilla again?
To Csilla?
Yes, since coming back.
What is this?
Santa's cape.
- He made it. 
- Him?
- He knows how to knit.
- Goddamn it, he's a boy!
No need for big words.
And no arguments at the table
"the meek shall eat
 and be satisfied”
"they shall praise the Lord"
"that seek him, your heart shall
 live for ever"
Amen.
Bon Appetit.
Bon Appetit.
- Want a beer? 
- No.
Say what you wanna say to me,
I'm sleepy.
Why are you talking to me in that tone?
- What tone?  
- This tone!
Did you wake me up for this?
And me, did I come back
 to hear that?
I don't know why you came back.
Why do you think?
I don’t care.  
You do what you want.
And Rudi?
I told you I take care of everything.
Of what exactly?
What are you insinuating?
You sleep with him?
He's 8 years old!
He's a little boy.
This way you keep him little,
 that's why he depends on you.
Bullshit.
You teach him knitting, 
but not German!
It calms him down, it's recommended
Recommended?  
Do you want to turn him into a sissy?
Does he have to kill animals
 to be a man?
He must be strong
So he doesn't get squashed.
- He will be in time.
- He's the laughingstock of his class!
- I worked like a dog out there.
- Not for me.
Watch what you say!
Or what?
- Raise your hand on me
again, and I'll leave. - Go ahead.
- And I'll take the little one.
- Never. He'll grow up in my house.
Your house?
Listen to me carefully. 
If you take my son, I will kill you.
Understood?
Stop.
You can go back to your sweetheart.
Don't sleep here
if you're going to act like this.
And if you want us to stay in
this house, Rudi and I.
 Sit down, Kaiser!
 Everything is automated.
- Are you married? 
 - Yes I am. 
- And you?
- No. Not anymore.
- Do you have children?
- Yes, I have two boys and one girl.
- You have children?
- No, not yet.
 Work, Work, Work.
 All the time.
What about him?
No, he's too young.
 He's 25, I'm 44. 
We say, "Multi inainte".
It means, “May you live long”
Thank you. 
It's Romanian.
Romanian is difficult.
- Well, I'm not Romanian.
- No?  
Actually I am,
but ethnically I'm Hungarian.
Does he speak English?
A little bit.
Look, your home.
 Oh nice.
The workers have arrived.
Aura, bring the cabbage, please.  
The porridge too
Are they Japanese?
He said Chinese,
 and then Nepalese.
In fact, they are Sri Lankan.
- Here we are.  
- Very good.
- Can we bring the...?
- Yes, yes. Please.
Do they know how to start a fire?
I think so.  
They'll be taught, otherwise.
- Come to lunch. 
- It's embarrassing. It's Christmas.
Come on!
And them? Do they eat pork?
Do you eat pork?
No,
 But don't worry.
Fish?
Excuse me, but to you, 
the world is the West.
More than raw material.
Colonies.
﻿-You're exaggerating.
- Not at all!
﻿We know your history very well.
﻿Anna can tell you.
﻿And you don't know anything
at all, about the East.
You're generalizing, but yeah.
History will always be the strongest
- It's the way it is.
- Yes, of course.
﻿You've become powerful, 
and have erected great cathedrals
Because we, here...
﻿We have been struggling
with the invaders. 
The Mongols, the Avars...
And the Huns, the worst of all.
 Yes, the Huns.
Look at the map.
Romania has always been between empires.
You have the Germans,
 the Russians, the Hungarians...
﻿And we've stood our ground here,
for two thousand years.
﻿Yes, but we also 
won two world wars.
- And you left us to the Russians!
- Enough politics!
Aura, bring the cabbage to the guests.
- I'm being a bother.
- No, have a seat.
Hello.
No, I don't want anything.  Thanks.
A little dessert?
That, I can't say no to.
Me neither.
- Mara, is Santa Claus gone?
- Yes.
You were still.
Still as a picture.
- We're waiting for you at rehearsals.
- She goes to the choir.
I've heard her sing before.
But playing an instrument would help her
- Some wine?  
- I have to drive.
Make some room!
I didn't introduce you to Mr. Ben
- Csilla. 
- Nice to meet you.
He is a member of a French NGO,
 for the protection of bears
And how long will you stay?
Until we finish.
  We are counting their population. 
And?
Still counting, no rush.
 - Very beautiful country, Transylvania.
Nice people...  - Yes.
And where do you... Sorry.
- I interrupted you.
- It's okay.
Transylvania is beautiful, Yes. 
But it's not a country.
Countries and regions...
It's all the same with Europe.
﻿We can say that we are all brothers.
Yes.  yes.  We have a saying here:
﻿"My brother is my brother, but
cheese costs money"
"Brother, brother,
but cheese is for money"
They teach this in school.
And where do you stay?
Here, upstairs.
At the request of the mayor,
this is part of the contract with EU.
Did you find workers?
We've had a tough time.  All these ads,
Nobody's answered...
They all work abroad
They destroyed our economy.
- I even suggested it to Matthias.
- What?
To work as a baker.
He will go back to Germany, 
he has a life there
We'll see what happens.
The little boy didn't speak German
 anymore since I left
It's okay, they learn fast 
when they're young.
He will learn what he needs.
Yeah.
Excuse me, I'm going to see Father Otto,
 he's bedridden
Very good.
No one should stay alone on Christmas.
There's only us ones 
who work non-stop
Thank God,
We need this bread every day.
Take some sarmale to your father!
It's all ready.
What is this?
- Cozonac.
- A sweet bread.
- What about this?
- Tuna pie.
Would you like some cozonac?
Can I?
Please...
There are nine sheep.
Same number as before, I think...
Papa?
I am at the hospital with Papa Otto. 
I can't come tonight, I'm sorry.
They look like they know what they're doing
That's good.
We could make 800 cozonacs
and sell them to Toplita
Should I confirm for the other two,
then?
Can we wait a bit more?
The deadline is approaching.
You're right, send the confirmation. 
Worst case, we lose the warranty.
Do you have any gifts for them?
For everyone. 
I invited them to the party tonight.
How is your old man?
There is beer.
One beer.
When are you bringing him home?
I'm waiting for his test results.
What's he got?
Something in the head
That sucks.
He didn't lose his mind, 
some sheep really did disappear.
Probably a bear.
- Will you be able to leave?
- I'll wait and see.
- Are you gonna lose your job?
- Maybe.
- Is there work here?
- Bad salaries.
And at the forestry?
They already cut everything
Moreover, they employ locals.
To save money.
Austrian bastards!
Are you done?
Done.
See you later.
- Bye, guys.
- Happy Holidays. 
- To you, too.
Bye.
More gypsies.
I saw some of them in the woods
Those aren't gypsies
They work in the factory.
Some Nepalese, or something
They make you black bread.
They couldn't find anyone from here?
At minimum wage?
Yes.
People leave for money,
leaving their children behind.
Fuck them and their salaries!
Hello, gringo!
Come have a chat!
Come here, come!
You wouldn't dare, right? You afraid?
They're probably the ones
who stole your sheep.
Since they don't eat pork.
You coming to the game to support us?
- Against who? 
 - Bradu.
We will crush them, the gypsies.
What? You're primarily German.
Barely, he's a real bastard.
Would you take Rudi
to your hockey team?
I'd love to, but him?
Take him to the game, maybe he'll like it.
Another one?
We kick the gypsies out, 
and these people replace them.
- He danced with your sister!
- You're kidding!
- I gotta go.
- See you.
- Is this a joke?
- I swear. 
Dirty cockroach,
You'll see what I'll do to you!
So, do you love me?
Do you love me?
I love to fuck you.
Fuck you!
You love me to fuck you.
In the ass.
Can't you say you love me?
I love you.
No, in Romanian.
In Romanian...
It's weird.
You mean for a big boy like you?
I can say it in Hungarian.
Go ahead.
Say it.
How is it said?
"Jo étvàgyat".
Jo étvàgyat.
Jo étvàgyat mucho. 
- What's in that bag?
- What bag?
That one there.
Some stuff.
Stuff, like?
A toothbrush,
things like that.
You can't say you love me,
but you're moving in with me?
I told you I love you.
Say it again.
Jo étvàgyat.
That means "Bon appetit".
I love you.
- What is this gun?
- It's for you.
To do what?
Just in case.
You live near the forest.
We all live near the forest.
Give it to Ana.
She doesn't love me.
And do I love you?
Don't you?
- Can you do me a favor?
- What is it?
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
Can you go to the Bicaz station?
I'd rather 
you not stay here tonight?
When, then?
I don't know.
I want to hold you.
You want to fuck me.
That too.
So?
When?
Tomorrow?
I don't know.
Tell me.
When?
Next year?
When the chickens have teeth?
Fuck me, baby.
I sent you a link, open it
Local forum
"Kill them all!"
These immigrants won't do anything
except stealing and killing people!
Would you like it
if Romanians said that about us?
If we say yes to these guys,
it'll be an invasion soon enough!
They have 10 children and 3 wives each,
and the European Union funds it all!
They bring diseases to us!
In Germany, they border on
1,500 euros, not counting allowances!
Kinga, please!
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Bucharest?
 No, no.
Bucharest is over there.
Ah, west...
No, West is that way.
I don't know, back home, all is west.
Is Budapest far from here?
It depends.
I am Rauff.
Thank you, I'll manage.
What is this?
For the game, tonight.  
Are you coming?
I'll see.
See you later.
Hello.
We cooked, please join us.
I can't.
I promised the boy we go.
Okay, next time.
Hold on tight!
Come on, Bradu!
Come on, Récfalva!
Are you okay?
Have no mercy, Geza! 
Hit where it hurts
Come on!
What are fighting for?
Let's go!
Go back home, Wallachians!
Go back home, Wallachians!
Long live Dacia!
Free!
Dacia!
Free!
Dacia!
Free!
Why are they dressed as bears?
To belong with the animals.
And what do they do with the sticks?
- They fight for new year's eve.
 - With whom?
- The uphill against the valley.
What for?
It's a tradition.
To chase away bad omens.
"NO IMMIGRANTS IN RECIA!"
"It's  Hungarians who discriminate!
Let them leave Romania!"
"Close all schools
that teach in Hungarian."
"Hate attracts hate.
Europe: queers and slavers.”
"It's the Hungarians who should leave,
 not the two foreigners!"
"Are strangers the ones 
firing other strangers?"
Go back to work!
May our parish be blessed,
 My it prosper
in the years to come,
And shall always be there someone...
to perpetuate the spirit of our ancestors.
Amen.
How is your old man?
Bring him to our church, 
It's pretty much the same.
- I'll suggest it.
-  Mathias!
Mr. Felix!
Thanks.
Father!
- Here.
- This is nice, you shouldn't have.
Happy new year.
Happy new year to you!
- Matthias
- What's up?  -
- Rudi's disappeared.
- How is that?
I couldn't find him anywhere.
What happened?
Rudi's disappeared
Are you hurt?
Bring the first aid kit.
Don't worry, he'll find him.
He'll find him.
Rudi!
Rudi!
Don't get closer.
Don't ever get close...
to a wild animal...
without being armed.
Happy new year!
They received death threats. 
Alick sent them to me.
Hold this, please.
Guys?  Mahinda, Alick?
Don't worry about it tonight.
  Not tonight
Let's have fun.
Put the phone away and...
We'll take care of you tomorrow.
Father, something must be done.
They are also children of God.
 They can be children of God 
in their homes.
We have nothing against them.
 But they don't belong here.
 We too have children
who work abroad
It's different in the city.
They blend in with the people.
They make bread.
  They're not builders.
Honestly, I don't buy bread 
from there anymore.
The problem is that we don't know 
anything about their hygiene.
They put their hands
 on our bread all day.
And it's us who eat it.
It's baked in an oven.
You don't think they touch it after that?
- True!
They touch it to box for transport.  
I've seen them myself.
And our workers, 
don't they touch it?
The pathologie of viruses is different
...in those countries.
Medically speaking.
If there were only one or two,
 that would be fine.
But they're now three.  
When will it stop?
Look what is happening abroad.
They welcomed a couple of workers,
and now it's like an invasion.
And then, they blow themselves up.
 Or they kidnap you in a car.
We just got rid of the Gypsies,
only to make the same mistake again?
He's right.
- I'll go talk to the factory about it.
- Okay, father.
Ask them why 
they didn't hire local workers.
You know well that most locals
from here work abroad
Do you find it normal that
they're taken advantage of by others?
While our villages 
are full of this kind of people.
You've seen the gypsies well!
They'll settle in any empty house.
Who knows what they want?
They want to go west, 
we're just a stepping stone. 
Don't raise your voice in church.
Father,
You have to talk to the factory
Immediately.
We are just a group of villagers.
Let's respect each other.
All has been heard, I'll go after mass.
We don't want them here.
We have nothing against them,
Just that they stay where they're from.
We don't want them in our church.
Take action before it's too late
We are going to pray all together
to get our focus back.
Look.
1500 euros a month, accommodation paid.
To be confirmed, but he must be a
resident, because he's half German.
- Does he speak German?
- Yes, with an accent.
That's a big plus. 
I'll take a look at butcher job offers.
Please.
As for the new two, 
do you have the papers?
Here they are.
Think about it and call me quickly.
It can't wait too long.
- Good day. 
- You too.
The priest asks to speak to Mrs. Dénes.
She's busy.
 It's about the workers.
People were angry at church.
Look, it's all with proper papers,
everything is legal.
I understand,
 but the villagers don't want them.
Should I throw them in the streets
right after I brought them here?
You should have made sure 
that our community approved it beforehand.
But we've been placing ads
 for several weeks
We have our priorities, 
we are asking for European funding.
- It's complicated. 
- Of course.
I don't want this
 to end up exploding.
How is that?
I'm telling you what people are saying. 
Take that into consideration.
Did these people tell you that they
created a Facebook group against them?
That they're sending them death threats?
 - Facebook, that's beyond me.
- We have to take this seriously.
Who are they bothering?
They work hard, they're good people.
That's possible, but...
People don't want the bread 
that they make.
- Why is that?
- Because they don't want it.
Sorry, this has gone too far.
They don't have the plague, everything
 is legal.  Sorry if that bothers you.
I doubt we're heading in the right
 direction, but I'll let them know.
- God bless you.
- And you too.
Come on. 
Stop.  Lift it.
Throw it.
Bravo.
The priest is back!
Again.
So, father? Any news?
Unfortunately,
she wouldn't let go of these immigrants.
Speak louder!
 What a whore.
I explained it to them.
For them, they are good, 
hardworking people.
Let them work for them, then.
Let's start a petition
 to drive them out of the village!
You have a paper?
Do you think 
this is a good idea?
Why not?  We'll say what we think.
Get back to work!
Hello.
Say hello to my boss, Csilla.
- Hi.
- Hi. 
Wait...
You don't have to worry, 
everything is fine, okay?
She says you are like a mother 
to us.
Yes.  I am the mother,
 and they are two very good boys.
They work hard.
They're good cooks. They cook wonderful.
Look, you want to see?
Look.
Fried chicken.
Vegetable rice.
Samoussas.
Good Appetite!
Thank you! Wait...
And this is the cook, Alick.
Say Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello.
So you don't have to worry, yes?
Everything is okay.
I will give you back Mahinda, 
to say goodbye
 - Bye.
- Bye.
Look, this is my brother.
- And this?
 - It's Pepsi.
Betsy?
What?
How is he called?
- What's here name?  - 
Pepsi. 
Pepsi!
I also have a dog, and his name is Kaiser.
Nice.
- And your brother, where is he?
- He's in China. He works there.
- And your family too?
- No, my family is in Sri Lanka.
- My brother is in Spain.
- Good.
- Where in Spain?
- Barcelona.
- And your parents?
- My parents are dead.
- I'm sorry!
- No don't worry.  It's okay.
He's a great musician!
 Philharmonic.
Yes. He makes music.
He can play on the glasses.
﻿Come on!
Show us.
Can you help me?
Hold the glass.
Very nice!  Can I?  
Amazing!
- Can you play this?
- Yes, I'll try.
Let's see.
Go back home, or we will kill you!
Kaputt!
Shame of you! 
Show yourself if you're real men!
You fucked the whole village,
and you're sucking black cocks now?
I'll call the police.  I know you! 
We know where you live, idiot.
Jancsi, is that you? 
I'll call your father.
If they don't leave, we'll burn you all!
Motherfuckers! Get the fuck out!
What is going on?
We can't keep them here, I'm sorry.
They are good people.
Probably, 
but my wife has a weak heart.
You said two, now it's three...
- We'll pay you extra.
- That's not the point.
- Take your advance and take them away.
- Take them where, at this hour?
We can't keep them here.
At least until tomorrow, 
I beg you.
What if these thugs come back, 
what are we going to do?
Risk my wife having a heart attack
for 500 lei?
An ambulance takes hours to get here, 
you know that.
What's wrong?
Can I help?
- Have you seen Rauff? 
 - No. 
Go back and see if he's inside.
- Where is Rauff?
- I don't know.
Rauff got very scared.
Is he really a baker?
Rauff!
He's not inside the house.
Okay, let's go.
- We go.
- Thank you.
Should I come with you?
No, it's okay.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Mahinda.
Thank you.
It's the new year, baby.
What's going on?
They foreigners got attacked.
They will sleep here tonight.
- They were attacked? 
 - Yes.
By whom?
I don't know, they were masked.
- Were they drunk men?
- Probably.
- Do you know who they were?
- I have no idea.
It's not my business anyway.
Oh really?
Even though we almost got burned alive?
What were you doing there?
- Is that the problem?
- This is part of it.
If they were the only ones to burn, 
would it be okay?
Of course not, but...
It's not their place to be here.
Why?
You're the ones who need them,
but they will never be at home here.
Okay, go home.
- And you, where will you sleep?
- Me?  What do you mean?
Where will you sleep?
Here, of course!
It's kind of crossing the line,
 if you ask my opinion.
I didn't ask for it.
We have sex, and that's it.
 I'm not your wife.
- We have sex, is that all?
- You know what I mean.
You don't say "I love you" to me, 
but you give me your opinion?
Yes, because...
I don't want you 
to sleep with strangers.
What's the problem?
You think we'll all have sex together?
Listen, if someone tries to touch you...
What?  What are you going to do?
I'm not your thing!
Go home, and put your life in order. 
If you're such a strong man.
Get out.
Read it back and sign it.
Already done.
- Is there anyone you suspect?  
- No. 
- Did they speak Romanian?
- Yes, but with an accent.
I see.
What do you see?
That they spoke Romanian
with an accent.
Will this help in the investigation?
It's a fact.
Everyone knows Romanian here, 
even the Hungarians.
But they don't speak it.
When they have to, they speak it.
 Got any news
regarding the online threats?
We've sent it to the county,
they have the required technology.
Is the mayor here?
Not today.
He's in town.
Contact me if necessary,
or if there's anything new.
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.
- Good day.
- You too.
- Any news on the third guy? 
 - No. 
- Did you tell the police?
- No.
I spoke to the mayor.
Tomorrow, he'll call
 a general meeting in the church.
Should we bring the press too?
He wants it to stay between us. 
Social media is already on fire
What about the grant application?
We'll stay on it.
- Can I confirm the other two?
- Yes.
In Ditrau, 
they told us to stop shipping.
- And in Toplita?  
- We only sold two boxes.
Here, in the village, they all returned
old bread from yesterday.
We could use this to make toast.
- We don't have packaging for it.
- We'll order some.
Bring it all inside.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Good morning.
- Is the priest here?
- He's having his breakfast.
Could you ask him to come over
when he's done?
God bless you!
-I told them you...
The mayor's called an assembly tomorrow?
Yes.
I just wanted you to meet them 
before this assembly.
Meet them?
Personally,
 I have nothing against them.
I'm only a messenger 
conveying to you the will of the people.
But you agree that we should
 witch-hunt them at the church?
Muslims have never been allowed 
to enter the church.
They are not Muslims.  
He is Catholic.
Ma'am
If people don't want them, 
I can't do anything.
Everyone has their place in this world
All as God wills it.
Is this Christian, Father?
Don't talk to me about Christianity. 
You never set foot in the church
And those who do, 
what do they benefit from going there?
Please, leave us.
It's getting late, and I have to get ready.
Bye.
Good day.
Good day.
Do you suspect anyone?
"Do I suspect anyone..."
Well?
Where were you last night?
- At home.
 - All alone?
Speak, we're already up to date.
What do you want from me, then?
Here's what I want.
Demeter Zsolt
He said that last night, 
He was with you.
True or false?
Since he said that...
Do you want us to bother Father Otto 
for this?
I don't think so.
Matthias,
Don't play with fire.
I called the county,
they asked me if you were here.
Your German employer 
asked them about you.
What am I gonna have to tell them?
Good evening.
Good evening!
Is Matthias here?
No, he isn't.
- I see, thanks.
- Any messages?
No, it's okay.  I'll call him.
How are you?
I'm alright.
Good night.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Why are you going with him?
- He's afraid!
- Let him go alone!
I will let him 
when he's no longer afraid.
Stop! You're crazy...
He saw a man.
In the woods.
Hanged on a tree.
Why didn't you tell me?
I learned that yesterday.
  He drew it for me.
Come on Rudi, we're gonna be late.
Show me where.
Was it here?
Rudi?
You see?
There's nothing to be scared about.
Maybe it wasn't here.
There's nothing. Tell him too. 
It's just fear.
- He saw it!
- What did he see?
Do you think people evaporate?
Maybe animals have eaten it.
I'm sorry, Rudi.
I didn't mean to scare you.  
Forgive me.
Before giving the floor to the mayor,
Let's pray together,
May God guide us
 to do what is right.
In what language?
Each in his own language. 
Our Father...
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come...
Steffi, I'm here!
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Father.
There are still people outside.
I leave the floor to Mr. Mayor.
Dear fellow citizens, allow me...
Louder! There's a crowd!
Speak louder.
Do you have a loudspeaker?
It's not plugged in.
There are loudspeakers in the ballroom.
- Is it occupied now? 
 - No. 
- Shall we go there? 
 - Yes.
It's warmer there.
Let's go,
everyone towards the ballroom.
Calm down, please!
Let me pass first!
To the ballroom.
Have a seat, please.
Will you allow me?
Can everyone hear me?
Yes.
in Romanian!
Is everything okay?
You're asking me if everything is okay?
Yes.
See for yourself.
I wanted to apologise.
For what?
- For pissing you off.
- Oh, that.
And for what I said.
Okay.
- Give me your hand.
- This is not the time.
Are you ashamed of me?
Everyone has their own language
- I'm asking your hand.
- This is not the moment.
Your hand and I'll behave.
...avoid spreading rumors
that will ridicule us later.
- Do we all agree?  
- Yes. 
Are there any journalists
 in the room?
Good. Very good.
I see more.
Not a problem.  
We have nothing to hide.
Our communities 
have always been well heard.
We have no conflict since the 1990s
- Except for that crime eight years ago.
- That was an unfortunate event.
But the perpetrator did not come
 from our historical communities.
Ever since there were no more
people of that race left in the village,
We coexisted peacefully, 
Hungarians and Romanians
- And the Germans!
- Yes, what's left of them!
Didn't we get rid of the gypsies,
and now we're arguing for foreigners?
Are gypsies the problem?
Let's watch the words we use.
 The West will be listening to us.
To hell with the West.
My son-in-law, in Germany,
They call him a gypsy
 all the time.
He is more German than
 the immigrants who pick up the garbage!
This is where it leads, tolerance.
Soon the West won't even
allow us to say mom or dad!
Well, I'll put it another way.
Such statements cause
harm to our local tourism.
- We have obligations towards the EU.
- To buy their low-quality products?
Let us start. 
 Here's what I propose.
I will say a few words
 and give you the floor.
Does anyone want to talk?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Let's stay civil,
 without interrupting each other.
As the one elected, I guarantee you...
those who want to express themselves
 can do so.
Is there a speaker in the room?
Well, let's get started.
we are here because 
you have signed a petition...
Because the local factory  hired
 foreign workers.
Legally.
They are not immigrants,
 as we hear everywhere.
You, dear fellow citizens,
 have submitted a petition
Demanding their expulsion.
Who signed it? The names!
- Do you have the list?
  - Yes.
Németh Zsolt, Kelemen Tibor,
Cipariu Aurica, Auner Matthias,
Teodorescu Avram, Lancu Aron...
It wasn't me
 who put my name on the list.
- I don't care about any of this.
- Exactly.
There are 395 signatures
Do you want me to read all the names?
411, precisely.
Make a copy, please, 
and attach it.
On the bulletin board.
There's also a list of people who
 agree to them staying with me here too.
Who?
I, Szabo Csilla,
Dénes Viktoria, Amzulescu Traian,
 Steffi Auner, Nagy Réka,
Németh Kinga, your sister...
These are factory workers!
﻿What?
- You got them to sign.
- We didn't force anyone.
They signed because they know
 these foreigners personally.
It is their own initiative.
Some even come from Bradu.
I work here,
I have the right to express my opinion.
How many names are on your list?
There are 28 of them, 
but we only started this morning.
Forget about it.
Excuse me!
So if things don't go your way,
you no longer want democracy.
395 against 28.
It's not even debatable!
411.
Let's continue.
- Mrs. Miklos.
- Would you allow me?
Closer to the speaker.
We have nothing against these people,
as long as they stay in their home.
Not in our factory. 
Their hands are in the bread we eat.
Sure, I'm old-fashioned,
but this disgusts me.
Me too.
Let's not buy from them again
as long as they still work there.
Finally, Mr. Mayor...
Let him talk. 
It's good to get an outside perspective.
Who is this guy again?
He comes from a French NGO,
for preservation...
Please.  Please.
I'm here to help you protect 
your wonderful biodiversity.
He helps us count 
the population of bears.
Does anyone need translation?
- We pay him for that?
- I don't know.
Please...
How much do we pay him
 to count our bears?
I don't know, 
we're not the ones paying him.
It's a matter of principle.
We're unemployed,
 the mine got shut...
By ecologists!
Animals ravage our lawns,
and we pay this guy to count our bears?
Why doesn't he count them in his country?
Because they don't have any more bears.
They killed them
 so they could build highways.
Same with wolves!
They're well developed now...
What about us,
Do we have to remain the zoo of Europe?
Like they did in Africa.
Except that we are not savages!
Please, let him speak.
Some calm!
Thank you.
I just wanted to say...
that today,
 people are free to move around.
We can see that, there are more Blacks
 and Arabs in Paris than the French.
We no longer dare to take the metro.
But these people are French
You wanted to colonize them,
you pay the price.
Not us. 
So what are they doing here?
Sir, there are also people from here
 begging in the streets of Paris.
Hungarians never beg!
Neither do Romanians,
It's the gypsies!
Don't get confused.
  Romanians, yes.
But there are also citizens.
Listen, Mr. Fraternité-Egalité...
If you love them so much,
why do you send them back to us?
Because they have to be
 integrated in their country.
It's impossible to integrate gypsies, 
stop being so blind!
Calm down, please!
If you were so good at this, you'd have
integrated your Blacks and Arabs.
- But we are.
- But we are what?
- They'll cut your throat before that.
- And it would deserved.
You haven't learned from Charlie Hebdo. 
You don't have anything sacred anymore.
Let's close a parenthesis on that,
 and get back to our topic.
By respecting us.
Who disrespected you?
We can't tell the truth anymore?
Go back to communism!
You're punished if you speak your mind.
Please, let's get back to our topic.
We are in the middle of it.
We've seen what happened
 in other countries.
It starts with one, two...
then they bring the whole family.
This is their way of doing it.
After that, they want mosques.
In Germany, one cannot even enter 
their neighborhoods.
They attack women in the street
 if they are not veiled.
I don't think 
we're in danger of that in this village.
But if we let them come,
won't they claim their rights?
Using bombs and everything.
Let them go away!
Rest assured,
no attacks will happen here.
Even if they blow us all up,
we won't be in the newspapers.
What are talking about?
Let's get back to you, Doctor,
but get right to the point.
I only have one remark to make.
I don't know 
these people from Bangladesh...
They're from Sri Lanka.
From Sri Lanka.  
And they may be very clean.
And I'll say it in Romanian
 so everyone can understand,
The pathologie is different...
Give me your hand.
Their diseases and viruses,
their immune response as well.
This is how we got AIDS, 
and bird flu,
and God knows what next.
Through human societies
directly associated with animals:
monkeys, bears, bats...
They spread them,
because they can go anywhere!
Doctor,
They were given a comprehensive
 health check before being employed.
If you allow me...
It's a matter of hygiene.
Excuse me, but Muslims
do not use toilet paper.
And they work in the bakery...
- They are not Muslims!
- Even so!
Please!
Mr. Baciu.
One last thing.
The end of the world,
won't be a nuclear bomb.
It's all these people
who invade us,
While the EU pays us with
parks in the countryside.
and ask for measured pickles.
Your pickles
are easy to measure!
This is a fact. 
Why make parks in the mountains?
I can tell you the answer.
This allows us to access 
available grants from the EU.
Those grants, are for parks
 in rural areas.
What about water channels?
  And paved roads?
There were no grants for that.
But with park grant money,
we lit the public streets.
I've been raising my hand from the start!
- Stay on topic.
- On topic.
My name is Brebu Vasile.
For those who don't know me,
 I work at the factory.
The real problem is this:
Why are foreigners employed 
instead of us?
People from here
 don't want to work.
How is that?
They prefer unemployment benefits.
That is wrong. I disagree
Aside from one or two lazy-pants,
as is the case everywhere
Our men work hard 
in every country they go to.
You know that very well,
 they don't pretend in those countries.
The Westerner,
when he hires you, he exploits you!
But he pays you well.
Exactly, well said. Thank you sir.
The question is: 
why does the factory pay so badly?
Why doesn't she pay us
for extra hours?
We pay extra hours. Double pay!
False! 43 hours of overtime, never paid.
I even filed a case against you.
You can check,
 we have been paying them since 2018.
You wouldn't think I'd believe that
I'm a former employee,
And I'm well positioned 
to tell everyone about extra hours
I never got paid for them.
- Mr. Brebu...
- Mr. Mayor.
I speak on behalf of all workers
Who never dare say anything...
for fear of being fired!
The ads have been there for weeks.
We want to hire people.
At minimum wage.
And if bread cost 5 lei?
Why not 10?
At the bakery, we work hard, 
even during the holidays.
Fresh bread,
it's needed every day.
That's true.
- You have to work hard?
- Yes.
So why doesn't that apply 
to you too?
How much did it cost, your Mercedes?
While you pay your workers 
so miserably!
My car is on lease.
All this on the backs of your workers,
madam.
The priest also has a Mercedes!
It's my mothers.
A used car.
We are going off topic again.
Thank you, Mr. Brebu, 
we have heard your complaints.
If you'll excuse me, 
I think we have the right to respond...
In Romanian, please!
Listen.
In recent years, we have created
 most of the local jobs.
We also support the local orchestra
and we want to continue 
developing the region.
For this, we are applying
 for European funds.
- As if it was for us!
- Yes, that money will be spent here.
Money that doesn't stay in your pockets!
We're getting further again.
I propose we take a vote.
Who votes to hire the foreigners
brought into the village?
It has to be clear.
Matthias?
I didn't quite understand.
Who votes for the foreigners to stay.
The problem wasn't well presented
Of course it was!
We are afraid of public opinion,
 but we obviously don't want them here.
Here's what I suggest 
to resolve the situation:
We'll equip the foreigners
 with a pair of gloves...
Otherwise, we will change their posts.
They won't touch the bread anymore.
We don't want them, 
what do you not understand?
What if we house them
in another village?
No, they need to go away!
Who's in agreement not to buy
their bread in the meantime?
There are still laws in this country.
That's why we want autonomy,
so that we don't take orders.
How can you, the Hungarians,
a minority among us,
Discriminate against other foreigners?
Auner Matthias!
Matthias, where are you?
Matthias, come here.
- What's going on?
- Papa Otto has hanged himself!
May God have mercy on him.
Help me.
I love you, papa.
I love you.
Let's reapply in 
the "less than 30 employees" category.
We no longer have time.
We're going to stop production
and we'll work on it tonight.
The other two are due to arrive tonight.
- We cancel it.
- We can't...
What else could we do 
given the situation?
- They are human beings. 
- I am well aware. 
But we are human beings too.
Without customers,
What took ten years to build,
 will disappear.
And we'll all end up on the street.
No one will end up on the street.
You'll find another job, 
and I’ll be left alone with debts.
Please, go redo the application.
No, I will not do it.
They have families, contracts, 
we can't just wash them off our hands.
No one washes their hands of anything.
I've spoken to the mayor.
They'll sleep at the station tonight.
Tomorrow we will appoint them in Bradu.  
Let them know.
I've been offered a job in Germany.
I didn't want to accept it, 
but given the context, I quit.
You were the last one not to stick
 a knife in my back.
You have until tomorrow 
to redo the application.
Inform the workers of my decision.
Take my car.
- The car is open.
- Okay.
- Is this all?  
- Yes.
 Goodbye. 
And don't worry, you'll be safe, there.
I'll come to see you later.
"Condoleante".
"Condoleante"
The flowers.
Thanks.
Good evening.
- My condolences.
- Thank you.
I'm so sorry, Matthias.
Who's there?
Rudi?
Let me in!
Ana!
Let me in!
- Where's Ana?
- She's asleep, what do you want?
- Calm the dogs down? 
- Why?
- I want to talk to her.
- She'll talk tomorrow.
Rudi!
- Come see papa!
- You're scaring him!
Your father loves you!
You'll talk tomorrow, in the calm!
Go inside.
- Get some rest, we'll talk tomorrow.
- Let me in!
Go home!
- Let me in!
- I'll call the police!
Let me in!
Rauff?
Rauff, wait.
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, I beg you!
