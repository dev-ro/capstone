This is the story
of a family like any other.
It could be set
in Tokyo, for example.
In New York.
Paris!
Or maybe...
in Rio de Janeiro!
But no.
It's almost in Rio.
This story is actually
set in Niteroi.
Yes, Niteroi.
Also known as
Nikiti City or Smile City.
And it's there, in the midst
of 5 hundred thousand people,
that our heroes live...
A family like any other.
Mrs. Herminia, the mother,
is a caring lady
that worries solely
with her children's education.
Marcelina,
I already told you to get in
that fucking shower!
I'll go when I feel like it.
When you feel like it,
you filthy girl?
Lunatic!
Marcelina, the daughter,
the family's little princess.
A teenager like any other.
She has a bright
future ahead of her.
This is Juliano,
the man of the house.
The eldest, Garib, married young
and gave up on the perks
of living with his mother.
And this is the father,
Carlos Alberto, who surrendered
to the charms of a young mermaid
and also left the house.
He never left, in order to leave
you need to come in first.
And Carlos Alberto
was never really here.
I find it very funny:
After separated,
he applies for
"world's greatest dad"!
Geez!
Juliano!
Yeah!
In a sec...
Juliano! Get those sneakers
out of the living room,
it's been growing
cobwebs for a week!
Nobody stands that reek!
Early morning,
and already bossing around.
- Mom is a pain!
- And you're awesome, right?
If I don't say anything,
no one volunteers.
Breakfast is set, come on.
Hurry up
with the breakfast, people.
- Mom...
- Your father's coming.
Mom, you bought less ham.
Just be thankful that I did,
that's coming off the list.
Have you no shame, girl?
You're fat as hell
and you still want more ham!
- Mom! You tossed Atila!
- Oh, my God! Get him out!
Guys, where's dad?
He's late...
Your father was never
on time for anything.
Even to get married
I got there first.
Geez! Speaking of marriage,
there wasn't
any cold water to drink,
you two drank
and didn't refill.
Mom's losing it, what does
marriage have to do with water?
It doesn't matter,
Marcelina.
You shouldn't be
worried about me,
you should be worried
about your panties. Filthy.
It's been hanging
on that shower for a week.
Wet, dry, wet, dry...
I don't know how
you haven't got an itch
on that pussy of yours!
Mom, Garib! Hey, how's it going?
Show your face more!
- Hi Garib, how are you, my son?
- Hi, mom!
Finally remembered
you have a mother, huh?
What, no phones in Brasilia?
Or is it that ridiculous
woman of yours?
Mom, you know very well
that since I came here
to start my vet clinic,
life's been crazy.
I'm glad you managed
to build that pet thing...
Now you can take care
of your wife.
What is she saying?
- She sent you a kiss!
- How sweet, send her another.
Mom, Andreia is here.
She is sending you a kiss.
Ok, fine then.
Your siblings are fine.
Everything is fine...
Drop that cookie!
Your father is coming.
He's picking them up
to go for a ride.
Good, send him
a kiss from me.
Oh, I will.
The first thing I'll do
when he sets foot here, Garib,
is send him a kiss.
Definitely!
Your father sets foot
in here, I'll say:
"Garib sent you a kiss", ok?
Come visit us
more often, ok?
Take care.
Why didn't you tell her?
How, Andreia?
Does she let me speak anything?
How I loathe that girl.
She thinks she owns him,
and she's ugly.
Mom! Poor Andreia.
She's so nice!
She's nice 'cause there's
no other choice.
When you're ugly
you need to spiritualize,
because the matter
is rotten.
There's your father,
let's go!
This family is really zen...
Can you lower the horn volume,
Carlos Alberto?
No need to get
neurotic on the horn.
- The neighbors appreciate it.
- Where are they?
Juliano's late
because he couldn't get up.
- As always...
- Got it from you, right?
And Marcelina is in a bad mood,
nobody can talk to her.
If you do a scan,
chances are she's brain dead.
- She's your daughter...
- Right, my daughter.
Yes. Your daughter.
I made her with my finger, huh,
Carlos Alberto?
Hurry up, kids, before I throw
a vase down there!
Juliano, darling,
did you get your asthma inhaler?
Did you, Juliano?
Hurray!
- Hi, dad!
- Hi!
Close the door, close it...
Marcelina, don't go crazy
on the ice cream,
your dad is a moron
and can't set limits.
And give Soraya a kiss,
that stepmother of yours!
That bitch!
MY MOM IS A CHARACTER
=- THE MOVIE -=
Dad, where are we going?
To get Soraya at the beauty
parlor, and then... country club!
The whale can't even hear
of water, she gets excited!
Mock me, Juliano, I'll
tell dad which animal you are.
Hi Marcelina, sweetie.
Hi Juliano, darling.
- Hi Soraya!
- What's up? Everything cool?
Excited to go to the club?
Very!
I'm super excited!
Honey, is my hair ok?
He forgot the asthma inhaler...
He doesn't forget his head
because it's stuck to his body.
- Guys, mom's calling...
- Already?!
- Hi, mom!
- Get back home,
you forgot your inhaler!
Mom, I'm breathing just fine.
I don't need the medicine, ok?
What if you have a crisis
and die, what then?
Relax, mom, I'm not
gonna have any crisis.
Even so, dad's got
a spare one in the car.
Ok, kisses!
Mom is a pain!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
I don't know
how we even stand her!
She does that sometimes...
- Sometimes? Always!
- Always...
God forbid! She's exaggerated,
a drama queen.
That's why dad didn't take it.
Got divorced.
- Nobody does.
- And you'll be just like her.
Have you lost it, Juliano?
I'll never be like her.
If I need to be like someone,
I'd rather be Soraya.
All dresed up, big hair,
riding around in a sports car
with a hunk like dad
on the side...
Much better
than being at home
doing the dishes
and being a pain in the ass!
Thanks, Ma!
Besides, if it were up
to me, I'd live with you guys.
Over my dead body...
Are you gonna say you don't
prefer living with them?
You don't, right, honey?
- I do...
- Much better!
- Need some help?
- No!
I want to see you smile,
I want to see you sing,
I want to see your body
dance all night long
I want to see you smile,
I want to see you sing,
I want to see your body...
She is beautiful, her hair...
Hi, aunt Zelia.
I came to spend
a few days with you, auntie.
I can't stand
those kids anymore.
I can't stand
being disobeyed, unappreciated
to be treated as less than a dog
by Marcelina and Juliano!
I can't stand it anymore!
I've lived a whole life
just for them! It's over!
From now on, I'll only think
about me. They'll see!
It's all about me now!
It's over!
But, honey,
you're too worked up!
What do you want me to do?
Coffee!
You listen to me,
Carlos Alberto.
This whole club thing...
it's in and out, ok?
I'm not spending
my whole day here
being the good stepmother
to those two pests!
One hour, tops!
Done, no more, enough!
"A pain, annoying,
exaggerated, drama queen".
That's what she said, auntie.
That's how she treats me.
If regret could kill,
I'd be dead already.
But it's normal...
All teens say horrible things
about their mothers.
- It comes with the job!
- And Juliano agreed!
They say that boys like him
are more affectionate,
companions, don't go out much,
very homey. But he's not!
He'd rather live with Carlos
Alberto and that bitch Soraya!
Marcelina...
Honey pie, look at me.
- I'm thin, right?
- And?
And you're fat,
right, darling?
You jumped into that pool
like a SeaWorld whale.
You know, those at Disney?
And then
a big splash comes out.
- That's you, honey.
- Since we're in the "SeaWorld",
can I tell you what you are?
- A mermaid...?
- A barracuda.
Has your mother
ever told you you're nasty?
No, but she told me
you were.
Carlos Alberto.
When I was younger,
I'd say:
"When it's my turn
it'll be different,
I'll be the best mom ever".
And then you find out
there's no such thing,
mothers are all the same,
and children are all
the same too.
We wait 9 months to give birth,
we suffer,
and when they come
we get a slap in the face!
Is it so hard for Marcelina
to be more polite?
The other day
she disobeyed me, embarassed me,
inside the supermarket,
I was stupefied!
Careful, girl!
Sorry, mister.
See what you did, tubby.
For God's sake,
forgive me.
She didn't crawl
as a baby...
And when they don't crawl,
they have no notion of space.
When you get home,
you're gonna parallel park,
between the table
and the sofa. Let's go.
Mom, I wanna buy
this shampoo!
You're not getting any,
put it back.
But I wanna look like her...
Marcelina, you've got
other priorities! Give it here.
- You're not getting it.
- Mom...
What good is that hair
with that body? You need a diet.
I'll put you on soup.
One of these days, I was like,
''Darling, go on a diet,
it will help you
and it will help mommy".
Then she went
to the endocrinologist.
And apparently, the doctor
told her to eat every 3 hours.
You see, auntie?
It was supposed to help me...
But I told her, I replied!
I told her: "Marcelina, darling,
it's every 3 hours,
a yoghurt, a fruit,
not a lasagna every 3 hours".
Do you think she listened?
Fuck no!
No, wait a minute,
give me that.
R$20,00 the ham,
not taking it. Go on.
- Cancellation.
- Cancellation.
But mom, I like ham...
Darling, someone
who wears XXXL like yourself,
obviously likes everything!
Don't overdo it!
I'm not XXXL, I'm just L!
Cancel it for me.
You're XL, Marcelina,
and if you eat an olive,
it's another X.
Fuck, that hag there...
Hey, fatty!
- Who's the fatty here?
- Yeah, who's the fatty?
You, roly-poly.
You're the fatty, chubby.
If you decided to eat healthy,
leave the register open for us.
Let others go through,
we don't have all day.
I'm gonna rearrange
your dental arch, you clown.
Look at that
eternal gengivitis.
Just ridiculous...
You don't need a dentist,
you need an architect
to redo the design.
Are you going
to offend me now?
I don't want to offend you,
I wanna help you!
In your case,
only some good praying.
Let's talk to the witch
from our building.
Don't mind her.
Are you taking the ham?
I'm not taking it!
I'm going
to eat bread with...?
- Who said you'll eat bread?
- Mom, you're a pain!
Put this chayote in,
I'm raising a monster.
But Marcelina was always
like this, auntie, desperate.
That one is a handful,
Herminia! Get ready...
- Who's the queen here?
- Marcelina!
Marcelina!
Get down from there!
How dare you talk
to me like that?
I'm the queen here, obey me!
Get down right now!
I will not! I'm playing.
You sit down.
Marcelina, come down
without jumping.
- There you have it...
- Go, Herminia, go!
See what you did, Marcelina?
Are you satisfied?
If you fall and die
you get me a big problem,
I've got no money
to bury you.
I'd bury you in the garden
until things get better.
- You're too stressed!
- It's because mommy loves you.
I couldn't find the one that
doesn't burn. It'll have to do.
- No, no!
- Almost done!
- It's burning...
- Nothing's burning.
- It's burning...
- It's faster like this!
Lunch with the family
was always something.
My sister Iesa
would always stir trouble.
Are you making
Joao's plate, Iesa?
No, Joao's on
his third plate by now.
He eats everything
by himself.
I don't even bother.
This is for Andre.
Wow! Andre eats salad?
How wonderful!
Andre gives me no trouble.
A little angel,
aren't you, Andre?
- A little angel.
- Didn't get it from you, Iesa.
Because you're
far from angel, quiet.
The quiet DNA is not yours,
it's the father's.
Yeah, he's quiet, but he's dull.
Dull people are usually quiet.
He's a dissimulated, two-face
deceiver, that's what he is.
Geez! Well, I'm staying
away from salad.
If I take it to her,
she may throw it in my face.
It's impossible to see her
eat something finer, fancier.
She got that from you,
huh, Herminia?
What? Geez!
The finesse DNA is not yours,
it's the father's.
The father has finesse?
Only if it's
on the street, Iesa.
Because at home, he mixes
food with breadcrumbs.
You know what else?
He fills up the whole plate
and puts a banana on top.
Is that finesse? A banana?
He puts banana...
Oh, the facts of life!
How appearances
can be deceiving, right?
I always thought Carlos Alberto
was a fancy guy,
- and you, the troublemaker...
- Me, the troublemaker, Iesa?
Where, exactly? You're the
troublemaker, ridiculous woman!
- Minding people's business!
- What business?
When did I do that!
I won't argue, Iesa.
Do you know why?
Because deep down,
you always hated me.
God, you make
some stuff up in your mind!
Why would I hate you?
- Because I have ass, you don't.
- So what?
"So what" what? One came
with a butt, the other didn't.
- I do have an ass!
- What ass? That board?
I'm gonna throw
this bacon on your head!
- Marcelina.
- Again!
- Again...
- Marcelina!
- Marcelina...
- Again...
She didn't get hurt
at all, auntie.
She doesn't get hurt,
she gets broken.
It's a whole
different level.
She broke arms, legs,
teeth, head...
I'd tell her: "Darling,
when you grow older,
you can be a contortionist".
With her first boyfriend,
do you know what I said?
This is not brand new,
ok, boy?
She's mended in several places.
On the honeymoon,
- she might fall apart.
- Mom!
You're going to ruin him...
He's too skinny for you.
Come on...
The only thing that calmed her
down was a good old hemorrhoid.
I've got
a small inflammation,
- a swelling, a protuberance...
- Where is it, miss?
In this case, it's on...
- It's hemorrhoid!
- Mom! You're out of your mind!
And you haven't pooped
in 4 days, Marcelina!
I was even wondering if you do
those stomach pumps.
Because this girl, the amount
she eats can fill a container.
She hasn't shit
for 4 days, so, 4 containers...
- I don't know what to do.
- I see...
I don't know,
maybe a stomach pump.
Do you do those
full check-outs?
- Check-ups, mom!
- Check-up, check-in, same shit!
Just get it pumped.
- Where do we drop her stool?
- Mom!
What's that? Free Willy?
Didn't you say
she hadn't gone for 4 days?
But she finally
did it, darling.
She shat and wreaked havoc.
The lab is this way, please.
- Mom, sit over there!
- You watch your tone with me.
Come on, sir, move it.
Thank you for your kindness.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
- I brought my samples.
- Did you collect them today?
Yes, but lower your voice!
What's the matter?
Everybody poops.
It doesn't matter!
I don't, until proven otherwise.
Speak louder and I'll collect
your tongue out!
Just hand over
the shit, Marcelina.
But on that day, auntie,
I laughed with joy.
I told her:
"Marcelina, darling,
when you mistreat me
in front of others
that's how I feel.
Embarrassed.
That's God's punishment,
sweetie".
Hey, mom!
Hey, Atila,
come here, boy...
- I missed you...
- Mom?
Hello.
Hello, Wesley, did you see
my mom down there?
She passed by here,
and not in a great mood.
- She even had luggage.
- Ok, thanks.
So, mrs. Herminia left?
For heaven's sake,
mrs. Juraci.
You're the syndic
but don't creep up on me.
Did she leave?
It's none of my business,
I don't know.
- So?
- She left, luggage and all.
But why?
Did you do anything?
Me? Of course not! Did you?
Me neither!
Where could she have gone?
Hello.
Your mother?
She's not here, no.
You guys fight, slap,
and want me in the middle?
I'm not getting into this!
Yes, she is here, ok?
You both screwed up,
she's upset and she's giving you
the silent treatment.
Bye.
What's the matter, Juliano?
Mom is spending some days there.
Aunt Zelia said we screwed up.
- What did we do?
- I have no idea...
That's one of her dramas!
I'm not falling for it.
I can't believe it!
Finally, peace in this house!
It's not funny, Marcelina.
Not at all.
I'm worried about her.
Geez...
Who called, auntie?
- Juliano.
- I knew it!
Juliano was always
more affectionate, more caring.
He's Marcelina's
complete opposite.
Never broke a nail,
that I know of.
I only wish he had
half of his sister's spirit,
but he was always
like that... different.
- Why did they mock you?
- I don't know.
And you, Garib? Why didn't you
defend your brother?
I'm not in his classroom, mom.
How was I to know?
Ear to the ground, connections,
talk to people. Investigate!
And why didn't you
mock them back?
- I don't know how, mom.
- You've got to learn,
what are you going to do
when I'm not here?
Are you a man
or a piece of bacon?
- A piece of bacon.
- Let's go, guys.
It took me a while
to get used
to my "piece of bacon" son...
Juliano?
Juliano? What are you
doing over there?
Carlos Alberto did
everything, auntie.
He put him
on soccer practice...
Watch the waist,
move the waist.
Jab, cross.
He even put him
in boxing lessons.
Actually, Carlos Alberto was
far more patient than me.
Punch it, darling.
Juliano,
fucking kill it, darling.
Yes, yes! You're doing well.
Juliano, give it
a whoop ass, like this.
Relax, let him do things
in his own time.
- What are you talking about?
- To each its own time.
You have yours,
I have mine, Juliano has his.
- What do you expect?
- Nothing, Carlos Alberto.
Just teach him any shit
from the masculine universe.
- Why not take him swimming?
- I did. He drowns.
- Judo?
- He gets beat up,
always the first one!
What do we do,
Carlos Alberto?
Son, come here.
Tell daddy and mommy:
What do you like to play?
Dolls.
Leave. Give me this.
On a Christmas, auntie,
he bought Juliano a skateboard.
We thought: it's ok
to play with dolls,
but while riding a skateboard.
Then it evens out...
Did you like it?
Garib, as usual, was never
any trouble, a golden boy.
- Did you like it, my son?
- Thanks, mom!
Here, look, essay tubes,
potassium permanganate...
- Drop that french toast!
- No, it's mine!
- Give it back to me.
- It's mine!
Carlos Alberto,
can you get her present
so she can drop the food?
Marcelina,
darling, your present.
Wow, dad! It's beautiful!
Thank you!
It's all pink, I love pink!
- Thanks, dad.
- Mine!
No, Juliano. It's hers!
Juliano, that's not
your present. It's hers.
- Yeah...
- Pink, look. A bow. It's hers.
- Not yours.
- What's the matter with pink?
It's not about being pink,
it's just hers.
The object is hers,
not yours.
- It's not about the color.
- It's hers.
- Daddy's got a pink shirt.
- You do, Carlos Alberto?
- It's lilac.
- Lilac!
- Oh, no, it's pink...
- Pink...
But that's not the issue,
it just isn't yours, it's hers!
- It's hers!
- Son, easy, easy!
Take her...
Marcelina, come with me, honey.
Come here...
See what you did?
Now what are we
giving Marcelina?
How about this one?
And this one?
No.
This one, my love.
I must have said
some awful things
to Juliano
without realizing it.
I was just so afraid
to see him suffer, auntie...
He was always so kind,
so sweet, such a good boy...
Hi, mom... This is Tiago.
- We just came to get a...
- Hi, Tiago! How are you?
- Hi, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Now that you're here, Tiago,
where did you meet Juliano?
Well, from life.
- What life?
- At a nightclub.
- Where?
- On the entrance line.
- What line?
- The bar's.
- Which bar?
- In the nightclub.
- Which nightclub, Juliano?
- A club that I go to.
- Who took you?
- Tiago.
- Isn't that where you two met?
- Different one.
You both sit down, now.
I want to talk to you.
Let's talk
about that nightclub.
Are there
more men or women there?
- More men.
- More women!
No, he lies!
One more thing...
Do the men get shirtless?
Yeah...
One more thing,
Tiago, sweetie...
The music, is it
those loud beats with no vocals?
Yeah...
Ok...
And the dancing, is it...
What do you want
to know? Just ask!
No, never mind.
Let's get the DVD.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
Yeah, he's kind of cute...
Juliano is really
a golden boy, no?
I miss
my "piece of bacon", auntie...
I'm not even hungry.
I'm starving!
What's there to eat?
There's everything...
Rice, beans...
We only have no clue
how to cook it.
What's the use?
We could ask aunt Iesa...
Are you crazy, Juliano?
Mom's already pissed at us,
if we drag aunt Iesa into it...
Let's starve
to death, then...
I got it! Waldeia's there!
- Waldeia!
- Deia...
What is it?
I'm on vacation. Hurry up.
- But you're here!
- I'm not "there", I'm "here".
"There" I'm on vacation.
"Here" I'm working.
I got an extra shift
at Iesa's.
It doesn't matter,
you have to help us. Mom left.
It's just
another of her dramas.
Soon she'll be back.
I know her. Geez...
Waldeia,
she left us with no food.
She did you a favor,
right, Marcelina?
You're a pain!
Speaking the truth makes you
a pain, huh... What, Juliano!
- We don't know how to cook.
- Then you'll have to learn.
What if World War III starts?
There's no more food?
Marcelina's stocked up,
what would you do?
Eat your fingers? Bye.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, auntie.
I think I overdid it.
Don't think about the kids.
You need to think
about yourself now.
Ok, auntie, I will.
So relax and sleep.
Ok, auntie, I will.
Up already, darling?
You're completely
right, auntie.
I was thinking.
They're not kids anymore.
I should focus on me now.
I'll change my life around.
You'll see.
That's more like it! Upbeat!
- Forget that housewife!
- Done.
- Forget those kids!
- Done!
- So let's hit the streets!
- Let's go, auntie!
They're both fine,
I'm sure of it.
- They have a strong bond.
- Let's go.
Auntie, I loved that you
brought me to Icarai beach,
it's been a long time
since I came here. Great idea.
Hi, Dea Lucia, are you ok?
Remember her?
You know what's good
about this beach?
There's only
beautiful people.
With one or two exceptions.
Look, Herminia, I'm going to say
something, don't be mad at me.
What I really think
you need is a man.
A man?! Auntie,
let me tell you:
"Seeing" and "having"
are two different things.
- You need a husband!
- Are you crazy, auntie?
One more at home
to increase my load...
Geez. A husband is not an object
you get in the supermarket
and simply take it home.
Nowadays, it's harder to get
husbands than public jobs.
A good one, then...
Nowadays, you're too picky!
In my days, we fixed them.
Today, you just trade them.
Men are annoying, auntie.
If uncle Iranizio was alive,
you would've killed him already!
Oh, the poverty...
Juliano, isn't Tiago coming?
You could call him, ask him
to bring sandwiches...
Of course not,
we just started dating,
I won't start
asking him things.
Why not?
Tell him mom freaked out,
left, and abandoned us
here with nothing.
We. Just. Started. Dating!
He shouldn't find out
this family is crazy.
Juliano, he already knows
mom is crazy!
I don't care, I won't do it.
Go out and buy it.
But I'm tired...
- Oh, decided to call?
- None of your business!
- Hey, hon...
- Ridiculous.
You see how life is...
I'm loving this time I'm
spending with you, auntie.
I'm loving it too,
having you here with me.
It's also good to get
away from that building.
It's full of crazies...
Not to mention mrs. Lourdes.
I get the chills
just by looking at her.
I'll hide
in the first hole I find.
Herminia! Herminia!
Fuck...
Hi, Mrs. Lourdes.
Is everything ok?
Oh my God, why did I ask?
Well, not really.
I don't know if I told you,
but I have some serious
intestine issues.
Always
such pleasant topics...
You did.
You told me your whole life.
I have a big problem,
I suffer from constipation.
I try everything, right?
Lots of fiber,
vegetables, papaya,
homeopathics, luck charms...
- To try and loosen the bowels.
- And?
Well, now it's loose...
My lord, you must have pooped
things from the 70's...
Girl, now I'm all loose,
everything, it's terrible.
I even changed the diet.
I bought cashew, bananas,
I don't know what else to buy
to control this.
Buy adult diapers.
How about that?
And some duct tape
to shut that mouth.
Never met someone with
so much to say.
Wesley! Wesley!
- He's not in...
- How so?
The doorman must be at the door.
It's in the regulations!
Oh my God,
if he doesn't get here
my arm will gangrene.
I'll yell him out. Wesleeey!
Totally lost the sense of
ridicule and respect for others.
I'm sorry, it was hard
to control. Just a little fart.
A little fart like that,
in a bigger scale,
could destroy mankind...
How I loathe this syndic.
A woman that size,
thinking she owns the building.
Sometimes I feel like
punching her to the ground.
It's really hard for me...
"For me"?
For us, honey.
- I'm sorry...
- Go, mrs. Lourdes.
- But I can wait...
- Go!
- New resident?
- Yes. 302.
Have you no shame, girl?
All that singing,
day and night.
My husband got
a new karaoke machine.
He sings all day,
I hate that thing.
And you don't sing, huh,
half-wit? I hear woman's voice.
But not for
a long time, right?
'Cause he's the fanatic,
won't let me sing.
And when it's my turn
he chooses my song.
- I don't know what to do.
- But I do.
Residents meeting today,
I'll be at your door,
with or without music.
Now, excuse me.
Residents meeting.
Let's go!
- Is it time already?
- Yes, of course.
What's this?
He's ruining the song.
- He ruins all of them.
- Oh, come on,
that song's wonderful.
That's just wrong.
Give it here, you goat.
Ridiculous...
Give it here.
I love you, I love you
Fuck...
I want to make you happy
Let's get the first plane...
Wait, you're early!
- Can't I join in?
- Of course not.
Have you ever seen
a country trio?
- It's always duos.
- Duos!
What the hell?
A last minute trio?
Hey, the residents
meeting is on!
For heaven's sake!
Asshole, son of a bitch...
I wanted to sing,
you stood by her.
You're messing
with me, give it.
- I love you, you know it.
- Yeah, right...
Cry for me, call me
You're fucked! Fucked!
Well, since nobody opposed,
I'll consider we all agreed,
and also decided on
the addition of an extra fee.
Now let's move on
to the next topic,
a very important one:
increasing the syndic's salary.
The syndic is
the authority figure
here in this building
and also the one with the most
responsibilities, of course.
That's why I put
this topic in our agenda
- Started already?
- Yes.
We've already decided
on the extra fee
and we are now
on the final considerations.
Good, you're
on your final consideration,
because that soft talk of yours
to get our money is old news.
The news now
are going to come from me.
I'm going to tell on everyone,
even Wesley is gonna go down.
I've never seen a doorman
that's not at the door.
How do you explain that?
Is he a ghost?
He comes to the door for 3min
and leaves. Is he a visitor?
I'll write down your complaint,
every opinion is valid.
After all, this is our home.
A "home" is where you're going,
if you don't knock
- that dull face off.
- That's absurd!
The absurd is you,
making this renovation up
and trying to shove
this extra fee on us.
But we need to finish
the garage renovation!
Exactly, darling, we need
to finish that construction!
3 months
drilling that garage.
Where are you getting at?
Earth's core?
Who did you join forces with?
Bin Laden?
That's a good one.
Bin Laden's dead!
What's so funny,
mr. Maranhao?
I think it's funny your interest
for this garage renovation.
What's it for? To put a large
kennel for you and your dogs?
I didn't even know
mr. Maranhao had a dog.
Three. A pit bull,
a siberian husky and him.
You see,
not even the syndic knew.
- This building is a joke.
- I'm confused.
- I'm getting a headache...
- We get one too, everyday
with that strong incense
you light up.
Can't you reduce
the frequency, girl?
Because you're
not the witch.
That's her, I'll be
with you in a sec.
Now you, lighting that incense
with those red eyes,
you're lighting
something else.
Your kids also "light" it.
My kids light it sporadically,
they're young.
You're a grown-up, an adult,
you lit it, you liked it,
you're hooked.
You light it up every day.
Guys, let's do something here.
It's over!
This is a circus act,
come on, leave!
Meeting's over. This is a joke.
I'm not myself today. Let's go!
Me, crazy? Pothead.
Look at that
aggressive pothead.
Come on, let's go.
Look at the sweaty one.
Go take a shower, you clown.
Ridiculous. Sweaty.
Good, you're
the last one here.
- I'm not alone.
- Oh, no? You're with whom?
- I'm with my guides.
- With your guides?
If you keep playing those drums
every Tuesday afternoon,
you'll be with them
on the same plane.
If you keep bugging me,
I'll incarnate a spirit
right here. An entity.
- I'll beat both your asses.
- That's absurd!
I'll disincarnate, if I have to.
Get out of here!
- Geez...
- Clown, colorful, ridiculous.
Too much negativity?
Have a salt shower.
Salt shower? I'll shove
salt down your throat.
Clown, ridiculous, colorful.
Go to the circus.
Did you see that, auntie?
Threatening me
with an entity!
But on that day
I said it all.
If I didn't,
I would explode.
That's what you should do.
Explode it all, then pick up
the pieces and restart.
Forget everything
and worry about yourself.
I try, auntie.
But, before I know it,
I'm already involved
with something else.
Now, for instance,
I'm talking to you here,
but I'm thinking
if the children ate well.
I can't help it.
HUNGRY!
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, hon.
Here, I brought
the sandwich you asked.
Great!
I brought you
one too, Marcelina.
It's chicken. I wasn't
sure about the side order.
- It's salad, right?
- Yeah... no.
Some fries would be better,
but in our predicament,
no other option,
I'll take the salad. Thanks.
And I brought your favorite:
- What?
- Cheese bacon.
What?
Wanna switch, Marcelina?
I'm not even gonna
fake it. Yeah!
- Here, orca!
- Handsome, you!
I'm glad I'm here
with you, you know?
- What's wrong?
- My house sucks.
My mother's
annoying as hell.
- So is ours.
- What do you mean, you lunatic?
Well, she's just not here,
but wherever she is,
she's annoying as hell.
That's how they
classify me: annoying.
These kids don't want
anything out of life.
Not at all. Never have.
When Iesa started living there,
I had to set some boundaries.
She'd go out to work,
and Joao Marcelo would stay
the whole day in my place.
The whole day!
That's how they are.
That's what they do.
Joao Marcelo and Andre Luis are
forbidden of stepping in here.
- Forbidden!
- Will you explain why?
You stay cramped up in here,
fighting, and I've had enough.
That's it? Not a good reason.
Give me more.
Fine, I'm crazy.
Not coming in!
- End of story! Forbidden!
- You see?
That's why I'm growing
with all these traumas.
I somatize it all
in my body,
get nervous,
then I can't stop eating.
So now, you being
fat is my fault.
- Yeah!
- I raised you both.
- He's thin!
- But he's gay!
Wha...? Marcelina!
Mom!
Mom, mom...
Look what you did! See?
Go get some help,
see if there's anyone
at aunt Iesa's. Go.
Run, girl! Mom, mom...
I think my mom's dead!
- What?
- Come, Andre!
Aunt? Aunt Herminia?
I told you I don't want you
in here anymore. Get out!
But weren't you dead?
That's your problem.
Get out. Move!
I was far from dead, auntie.
I just faked it so I could
get out of that conversation.
I thought,
with Iesa next door...
raising the children would be
easier. You'd help each other.
Help, auntie?
We just added up the problems,
she was full of them too.
You scared me! What now?
Come on, sit over there.
Herminia, can you believe
Andre started smoking?
I don't believe it,
give me one.
We try setting the example.
I do it all, I work my ass off,
I suffer all day
in order for them
to learn, but they don't!
Look at
your mother's example.
Look at what she's become.
A delusional,
failed, heinous,
assless, golden-teethed,
decadent woman.
- Hey, don't overdo it!
- You're enabling smoking, then?
I'm glad
I don't have that here.
My kids never smoked or put
a cigarette on their mouths.
- Yes, they did.
- What?
I saw Marcelina smoking
one of these days.
What! I'm not feeling well,
I'm blacking out,
- got the chills, look.
- Bullshit.
Hold those chills,
because I'm not done.
If Juliano doesn't,
he soon will.
He's obviously
full of issues,
and cigarettes are home
to unbalanced people.
Just like you, Iesa.
You're living proof!
- What are you, a saint?
- No, but do you think I forgot?
That fit you threw when mom died
and left me the coffee table?
Mom hated me.
It had to be it.
- Hated you, my ass!
- If she didn't,
the coffee table would be
mine, not yours.
This living room
is all cluttered,
full of knickknacks.
Ridiculous.
Nobody walks in here, it's like
a museum, and old store, a mess.
- What's this? Jealous much?
- It's not fair!
Mom always knew
I loved that coffee table.
You had to bring it up...
So annoying, this whole coffee
table thing. A circus act.
It's mine! Enough!
Mom died and left it with me.
Solid wood, wonderful.
You'll die before you get it.
- Who said you won't die first?
- What?
You're older than me.
It's only natural.
When you die,
I get the coffee table.
Yeah, sure, I'll put it
in my will, darling!
I'll put,
"Coffee table: not Iesa's".
- Then who'll get it?
- No one.
I'll just put, colon:
"Except Iesa"...
Weren't you about
to black out, faint,
have a thing,
full of chills?
- Aren't you going to bed?
- How?
No time for that,
I'm a busy woman,
anguished, full of problems.
I think, Herminia.
I'm troubled, it's karma.
- I don't sleep, sis.
- Go find yourself a man!
Why don't you go first?
- Geez... Why?
- You find a scumbag,
- I'll find a better one.
- Competitive much?
I'm not,
the table should be mine.
Now we're back
on the coffee table!
It should be mine!
Holy fuck!
Look here, Herminia,
you know what I think?
That you never
cared for Garib.
You never gave him
much thought.
You never talk about him.
It seems there's only Juliano
and Marcelina in your life.
What can I say
about Garib, auntie?
He always had good grades,
always studied.
He left home, so different
from the rest of the family!
I don't know...
Something's fishy.
I'll make some coffee.
Geez!
She came in strong,
no "good morning",
and already laid
an intrigue. This soon!
- Hello.
- Hello, Garib...
- Hey, mom, what is it?
- Let me ask you something:
Did you have
that childhood trauma thing?
- No, of course not, mom.
- Are you sure of that, Garib?
No backsies. Kisses, bye.
Aunt Zelia, let me
tell you: I called Garib.
No traumas there. Ok?
They have nothing
to be traumatized about.
They always had everything.
I made all
the birthday parties.
It was my pleasure.
Geez! Crazy woman...
Quit it!
She's crazy...
I don't know where my mind was
when I decided to do this party.
Next time, put me
in an asylum first, Waldeia.
I don't know why
you invited so many.
I'm not sure
there's enough food!
How come!
Look at all these hotdogs!
Kids party is just hotdogs
and soda, that's enough!
Except it's juice, not soda.
- Same thing, Waldeia.
- Where?
In this world?
Which country? Geez.
- Hi!
- I'm hungry!
- Here, hotdogs!
- I don't like hotdogs.
But you're gonna eat them! You
are gonna eat this shit. Here.
- I'm thirsty!
- Juice is coming, ok?
- Yes, juice.
- I wanted soda.
"Wanted"!
You used the correct tense.
Wanted! There's no soda.
Give me this balloon.
Look at the clown, look!
Don't you wanna
do anything, you clown?
What's this?
Give me this shit.
Shitty clown, never again.
Benjamin, let's take
some hotdogs to Marcelina.
You pests!
Balloons, never again.
Hotdogs!
Mom, I told you
not to come in here! Get out!
I told you!
Hotdogs!
- Mom, get out!
- Fuck...
Stop barging in
all the time,
we're not doing anything!
It's my birthday...
I don't want closed doors!
That's it!
It's my birthday,
you're a pain!
Marcelina, I told you I don't
want this fucking door closed!
What's that
you're hiding there?
This, mom... It's a... a...
a sort of clay,
like... humus.
It's like a compost
that gets the plants...
High, Marcelina?
Super high.
Do you think I was
born yesterday?
I' from
the Woodstock generation.
- Are you crazy?
- Mom, you went to Woodstock?
I did, passed straight by it.
But I felt the stink.
Moms and dads
are not morons.
I want this door open.
They think they know
everything about life.
That mothers and fathers
have no other concerns.
You know...
They don't realize
we also have a history.
We also suffered,
got happy, disappointed...
You know? Teenagers
are very hard, auntie.
I would rather have
20 kids than one teenager.
Teenagers think nothing bad
will ever happen to them.
They think
they're immortals.
I wish...
Mom. Mom, wake up.
Mom, something happened
to Andre Luiz.
We spend our children's
adolescence with no sleep,
hoping nothing bad
will happen.
And when Andre died,
my God...
For a second there,
the whole family died with him.
But I think, auntie, that
when a mother loses a son,
all the mothers in the world
lose a bit of themselves.
This conversation
took a turn, huh...
Yes, I'm sorry...
I said too much.
You did. You opened a lot
of parenthesis and closed none.
But I'm glad I have you
to open them with.
I'm very lonely at home.
If it's up to the children,
they never talk to me.
They don't bother.
They come in,
stay for 5 minutes,
and go back out.
Marcelina,
forget that nightclub!
Forget the partying.
No partying!
Marcelina, you come
home right now!
Do not set
my dysrhythmia off!
Forget the beer! No!
Because I don't want you to!
Just because.
Yes, it is an answer!
Just because!
Because I'm crazy!
Come home.
I don't want you there.
Come... Oh, disobey me!
You hang up on me,
and I'll show up there
in my nighties.
Forget the beer! No!
Let's go, I'm going after her.
Come on, Juliano.
Mom! You're
in your nightgown!
I don't care. Should I dress up
just to slap her face?
Wait!
Come, Juliano. Excuse me,
I'm an elderly, I go in first.
Stop it, mom!
Sorry, sorry.
She's nervous...
Mom, please.
- Sorry, hi.
- Good evening.
I was wondering,
why is everyone in pajamas?
It's a pajama party today,
and you're
not dressed for it.
- Call Liege.
- Who's Liege?
Liege Monteiro,
our greatest press secretary.
- I went to school with her!
- Let me explain.
Liege didn't
throw this party.
It's Carol Sampaio's, ok?
From "Favorite"?
- I know her.
- We know her, sure.
Let's speed this up.
You can go,
because you're dressed
for it. You can't.
- Pants off.
- I won't...
- Take them off!
- I can't!
- Right now!
- No, not here...
Shut up,
mind your own! Let's go.
Geez, that ridiculous lingerie,
minding my son's business.
Put it here. There.
He's dressed, you clown.
He's dressed!
- Out of my way!
- Excuse me.
Let's go... Geez!
What a lunatic!
God knows what He's doing.
Look at the parties
your sister goes to!
Pajama party!
In my days, there was
nothing like this.
No way!
Carlos Alberto only saw me
like this after we got married.
If he had seen it before,
we might not have got married.
On the other hand, mom,
now everybody's looking!
After a certain age,
we put it in God's hand.
Now shut up!
Help me find your sister.
Look at this nightclub,
full of whores.
Excuse me...
Out of my way.
Are you Carol?
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Since you own all this,
turn this shit off, please.
Shut up, "boo" my ass!
Marcelina, look at me,
you can't hide for long,
mommy knows you're there.
Ok, darling?
I'll just say stuff,
you're probably embarrassed,
but then at least
you'll have a reason.
Guys, Marcelina is the filthiest
girl ever, you have no idea.
She didn't get it from me!
- It's the father's fault.
- Mom!
One more thing:
She wears the same shirt
700 times, never changes it.
She fills her armpit
with deodorant,
to get the B.O. out,
then she gets that thick
yellow crust there,
because she has B.O.
It's normal at that age,
- it's a hormonal B.O...
- Mom!
Hi, Marcelina, I was
just talking about you!
- Let's go, mom!
- Wait a minute, not now,
I'm enjoying this chat.
Isn't it fun, guys?
Mom, that can't be
your normal you.
Why not? I'm young too,
of course I'm not normal!
Can anyone be normal here,
like a videogame,
this ridiculous music?
Are you trying
to embarrass me to death?
I wouldn't say "death",
but since I'm here,
I'd like to have a chat.
Here's the thing:
Raise your hands whoever
finished middle school.
Wonderful, good students!
How about high school?
The numbers started
to drop, Marcelina.
And college?
Did you finish?
This is an embarrassment...
So this is
the "ungraduated" crowd...
The "ungraduated" nightclub.
Wonderful, guys.
Marcelina is
"ungraduated" too.
How many times have you
sucked at your SATs?
She's dumb,
she can't assimilate.
- You know, the questions...
- You're destroying my image!
Of course not,
I'm just talking...
- Aren't you enjoying it?
- Yeah!
Then you stay there
while I have drink at the bar.
Like hell you will!
I'm so embarrassed!
You, embarrassed?
I'm embarrassed!
Look at her clothes,
like a slut!
As if she
didn't have a mother.
I'll never show
my face there again!
Damn right, Marcelina!
You're never going there again!
Ridiculous!
Full of ridiculous people.
That decadent, dark place...
I think I miss
mom's craziness...
Let's call her,
ask her to come back.
I won't! She left,
she should call us.
If mom were here
right now...
I'm looking for 50 bucks
she owes me. Beat it!
Let's take a walk, auntie.
I'll buy some things
and cook you a delicious meal.
I don't want it,
I'm not hungry.
Then I'll buy
some appetizers for us.
No, only old people
eat appetizers...
What's the matter?
What happened?
A thousand things.
Look at this.
What's that?
I can't forget that kiss.
I didn't even watch the movie.
I can't stop
thinking about you.
Time has proved that my love
was real, that I wasn't crazy.
I can't imagine
my life without you.
Herminia, our children are
beautiful and healthy.
That's the greatest proof
our love was worth it.
But we can't look away
from what's happening...
Mom, you're
the prettiest rose of all.
We can't live without you.
I'll call her.
Come on, auntie.
I forgot my wallet.
Wait just a second.
What for, auntie?
I've got money.
I don't leave home
without my ID. Just a second.
Yeah, get your ID.
Old people can't
walk around unidentified.
Old people
must always be alert.
- They're not answering.
- Maybe they're sleeping.
I'll try again.
Damn it...
- Hello?
- Hi, auntie!
Finally! I was worried...
What's happening?
Why is mom acting like this?
Look, darling,
I shouldn't say anything.
But this has gone too far.
Here's what happened:
But I ask you first
not to tell her I told you,
because you can be
a big mouth sometimes...
Hey!
Took you a while, auntie!
What happened?
Imagine that,
I forgot where I put my wallet.
Why do you hide
things, auntie?
After a certain age
we can't hide anything,
two minutes later
we forget where we hid it.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Honey, I don't
want to butt in,
but don't you think
it's time to go back home?
Yeah, I do,
but what of my pride?
As long as I remember
what they said...
- Forget that...
- Why? Do you want me to go?
If that's it, I'll go.
Am I bothering you?
- No, not at all.
- If you want me to, I'll go.
- Do you want to go?
- Do you want me to go?
I'll tell them I came back
because you told me to.
You're dying to go back!
Of course I am!
And my pride?
Where do I put it?
Of course I am...
And?
What do you think?
They left.
And the doorman,
with that dull face,
has no idea where they went.
Aargh... She should
get a cellphone...
Yeah, absurd...
When I get home,
I'll tell them
next time they disobey me,
it won't be an ice treatment,
it'll be an iceberg.
They'll see. Next time,
I'll get my savings and go
to New York. I'll leave a note:
- "I left, don't bother..."
- Take me with you!
Definitely, auntie.
Relax, Marcelina, relax!
At least we know mom's
with aunt Zelia, she's fine.
She's not fine, Juliano.
- And I feel terrible.
- Don't be like this.
Come here. What is it
you wanted to do, again?
- Eat...
- Ah, eat...
Campo de Sao Bento looks
prettier every day, isn't it?
It's true, this is just like
Central Park, but in Niteroi.
- Hi?
- Could I interview you?
- Of course!
- What's your name?
- Herminia and Zelia.
- We're going in live, ok?
I told you
to get those curlers out.
- It's fine...
- We're going in.
- I'm here with mrs. Herminia...
- And Zelia.
I wanted to know from you,
have you noticed
the food prices increase?
Of course I have!
This whole
"the country is broke",
that's just silly, boy.
It's broken for ages...
At home, things are
broken for a while.
This week was
the microwave oven,
it had a one-year warranty.
After one year and one day,
it broke. Right?
God, I'm so happy!
Marcelina, look!
Unbelievable!
What's this?!
Is it live? Where?
It's at Campo de Sao Bento,
mom's there right now. Let's go!
Very nice of you.
Home appliances, nowadays,
are not like before.
Thanks for...
Hold up.
I've got more to say.
Look at that, Soraya.
She loves the spotlight.
There are things
mothers don't say.
In fact, let me do
something here.
Yeah. In my opinion,
a woman has to be discreet,
has to shine naturally.
I wanted to tell you all:
respect your mothers, ok?
Wow, cameras
really make you fat, right?
Let me listen.
No, hold up, 3 minutes
is too little for a mother.
We act a little bit crazy,
just because
we really are, ok?
But we mean well.
Who's this crazy woman?
Cut, cut, cut!
No, no, wait. Let her...
- The ratings are going up.
- We may be a pain, you know...
I am.
When my kids ask me
things I don't have,
it hurts, isn't that right,
auntie? It hurts.
We want to give,
but we don't have it!
Then, what's left, boy?
You see? We suffer.
Raising is difficult,
the thing is...
Making it is easy,
but raising... right, auntie?
But I tell them this:
Enjoy your mom
while she's alive,
because our only certainty
is that we'll die, you see?
- Mom!
- Those are mine...
- I miss you!
- You're coming back, right?
Do you promise to...
- I missed you so much!
- I missed you both...
Buddy, excuse us,
this not a reality show.
Babe. Babe...
Even I missed you,
can you believe it?
They're through the roof,
can you imagine?
Will you get
the wet towel off the bed?
Yes...
Do you promise to put
the toothpaste lid back on
- for the shit not to get lumpy?
- Yes...
Babe, let's go
to the bedroom.
Let's go, babe.
To the bedroom?
Nothing for you today,
ok, babe?
Do you...
I won't promise anything.
Moms are neutral, right?
Let's go, guys. I was going
to have a heart attack...
I'm starving...
ONE WEEK LATER
Mrs Herminia!
Do you wanna
give me a heart attack?
God forbid!
If you die I lose my job.
Mr. Carlos Alberto's coming
and they won't wake up
to take a shower.
The rooms are stinking rotten.
They won't?
There! Marcelina,
you've showered. Let's go.
Your father's coming.
Juliano,
your father's coming.
Will you have a bathroom
or a bedroom shower?
He chose the traditional one,
that's great.
Cleaning the ballroom
for the party, Marcelina?
- Pass me the sweetener.
- I won't!
- I'll spend some days away...
- Disobeying me this early?
- Soon, they'll be slapping you.
- You see...?
But mom, come on...
Waking us up with water?
What's this? Are you all
ganging up on me now?
Answer the phone, Waldeia.
- It's not for me.
- You see...?
Hello.
Hi, aunt Zelia, how are you?
Everything's fine.
Yes, everything's great.
Yeah, we're
much better than before!
Aunt Zelia, I'm hanging up now,
Carlos Alberto's here.
Now the gang's finally full.
Let me see if that
"slum madame" is here too.
Ok? Kisses.
Let me check if the boss
bandit dared to come.
There, she did.
Hi, Soraya!
Everything ok?
Nice dress, darling!
Thanks, honey pie.
Carlos Alberto gave me.
Expensive...
Such good taste,
Carlos Alberto!
Always had, Herminia!
That's why I married you.
Married and then
dumped me...
Do you know why, honey pie?
In time, people get
finer tastes.
- Hi!
- Hi, Soraya.
Hi, honey. How are you?
What's up...
Hi, dad!
They didn't
even give me a kiss...
Why would they start now?
Look, it's filthy!
You clown!
Be careful, kids, and look!
Mommy loves you...
Hi, aunt Zelia.
Hello, I'd like to talk
to mrs. Herminia.
- That would be me.
- Hi, you don't know me,
my name's Joao Fonseca.
I'm the director
of a TV station.
You were interviewed live
on our show...
Yes...
I'd like to say that
the interview was a huge hit.
We got several e-mails,
and we thought
about creating a TV show,
just for you.
Not even
in my wildest dreams
I'd think my life would get
turned around like this.
But if there's a group
of people whose lives
keep getting turned around,
it's moms, no doubt about it.
- Waldeia?
- Yes.
Have you ever thought about
working at a celebrity's house?
No, I thought about me
being the celebrity.
Me, having all the fame.
What are you talking about?
No, never mind.
Just curious.
ONE MONTH LATER
Attention, 1, 2, 3, recording.
Good morning to all
our mom viewers. Welcome!
We welcome you too,
sons of a gun!
You, who don't
appreciate us,
for you, I say: "Wait,
yours is coming your way".
So, Margareth, let's talk
to Margareth real quick.
Your daughter flunked
the 8th grade 8 times now.
I can't believe it,
she's completely hopeless.
What would you do, Eunice?
- I'd beat her good.
- Did you or did you not?
I did, so hard,
even more than I should.
At home, that's
how they learn.
- Do you know it's not true?
- No?
They don't learn. I'd even
like to send a message here:
You can't beat them up,
you go to jail.
It's in the law. You can't
beat them in any way.
When I've had enough,
what do I do?
I throw
the first thing I see at them...
But that's also beating.
But then you don't leave
your fingerprint on them.
You send your message
and walk away free.
So, if you want to beat
the dirt off your clothes,
do you know what you do?
Here. Come here, honey.
This girl slows us down.
It's the dynamic duo,
Liquid Ariel and Downy.
All the dirt goes away
with Liquid Ariel.
And Downy's scent is four times
stronger than the others.
So, now, back to the talk.
You can go now.
THREE WEEKS LATER
Don't you miss,
in a few moments, on MDG,
the premiere
of Herminia Show.
- Today's the premiere!
- Don't even...
- Are you smoking?
- Oh, auntie, I'm nervous!
Then you're the usual you.
And Iesa, is she here yet?
Iesa's not watching it here
because she's cold.
Who's cold?
Who said I'm cold?
Did you change your mind?
I'm watching it with you,
here, with the family.
- Are you smoking?
- Mind your own business, Iesa.
Mom, you're not gonna
believe this. Dad's coming up.
Your dad? Unbelievable!
Today's the day...
Hi, Soraya!
- Hey, honey!
- You ok?
- Hi, dad...
- How are you, my son?
Hi. No need...
- How are you, Carlos Alberto?
- Herminia!
I had to come
and congratulate you.
Congratulations, Herminia.
You're going to be famous!
Is there anything to drink
or only after the fame?
There's something for you, yes.
Waldeia, get Soraya some water.
Sit, Carlos Alberto,
be my guest.
Hello, hi.
Hi, honey!
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thank you.
I do.
Is there anything
you don't, Soraya?
- The bathroom...?
- Find it yourself.
- Still jealous, Herminia?
- Of you, Carlos Alberto?
An old man like that.
In a few moments,
the must-see show for moms.
Have you boiled the water,
pretty thing?
- Do you know Physics?
- What?
Physics states that water only
boils at a certain temperature.
I don't know exactly which,
because I don't have exactitude.
It won't boil sooner
just because you want to.
But I think Physics
must do what I want.
Everybody does,
why would Physics be different?
Because that's
what you think.
I don't work with thoughts,
I work with exactitudes.
Did you like it?
What?
This middle class kitchen?
Not really. Too small.
I like space,
you know, Wal...?
- Waldeia.
- Waldete...
Do you know how many
square meters my apartment has?
Yeah, you really need
a lot of meters
- to fit that arrogance.
- Wow...
one of Snow White's dwarves
started talking!
You know what you look like?
A little ant...
But with that big head,
it's more of a fire ant...
What's your problem?
Tract infection?
Yeast infection?
Constipation?
Drink plum juice.
It'll fix
that face of yours.
Who do you think
you are, Jiminy Cricket?
She doesn't think
she is, she is!
And if she's Jiminy Cricket,
you're Noah's ark.
You're a cow, a hen, a bitch,
a rhino, a snake, everything.
- Gloves off now?
- Exactly.
Just because I dissed
your tiny little maid?
She's not a maid, honey.
She's family.
- Unlike you.
- You listen to me, Herminia...
Mrs. Herminia!
It's Mrs. Herminia for you.
Santa?
That's right, I forgot
you're way older than me.
I'm older, far older,
far more interesting,
far more anything than you.
Someone like you should
understand that time passes.
For you, time flew!
You should fly too.
Get out of my kitchen.
Don't touch me.
One more thing:
Herminia, you're swollen...
You'll be swollen too
when I shove this tray
down your throat. Clown!
Herminia.
What is it, Carlos Alberto?
Round two?
- No, I owe you an apology.
- Carlos Alberto...
I know perfectly well
I wasn't a good husband.
I'm not the greatest
father either, but...
I want you to know that
despite everything,
I really like you.
Let me tell you something.
You were a great husband,
you are a great father
and the kids love you.
Everything's fine.
- But your part is very hard.
- It's not hard, it's easy...
What do I do?
I go to the supermarket,
buy something,
come back, do the dishes,
do the laundry, forgot
something, go back...
- Yeah, my part is hard...
- Yes, very hard.
When I put it this way...
I think we're starting
to get along, Carlos Alberto.
I think so too.
Only one think left
for us to really get along.
- What?
- Dump that son of a bitch!
- Mom, Garib's here.
- Garib, Carlos Alberto!
Hi, Garib, my son!
Long time no see!
Do you want
anything to drink?
I'm really thirsty,
I'd love a drink.
Of course. Waldeia, bring this
girl some water! Excuse us.
Darling, anything to drink?
Some grape juice...
Get out, honey.
You take too much room.
Have a seat.
- What's up?
- Are you guys ok?
No, I'm fine.
Actually, I'd like
to take the time,
since everyone's here,
to give some great news:
Andreia and I...
We're pregnant!
You're going to be
a grandmother!
How do you spring
something like that on me
on the day
of my show's premiere!
Mom, be quiet
so you can rest, please!
Jesus, how will we
raise this child?
Every other day in my place?
Mom, I live in Brasilia!
We'll talk later.
My goodness...
What are we going to do?
Give me the name
of that baby food,
I'm doing groceries today,
I'll stock it up.
Mom, we're only 3 months in.
We don't even know the gender.
I'll buy unisex baby food.
Not a problem, Garib.
See the shit you did, Garib?
Not long ago I spent
two days at Zelia's,
how long will I
need to be here?
I'm shutting up, now.
I need to be alive
when my show premieres.
THIS MOVIE IS DEDICATED
TO ALL BRAZILIAN MOMS,
ESPECIALLY TO DEA LUCIA,
INSPIRING MUSE OF THIS PIECE.
Delete it! I'm going to tell
the fucked up things
you do at home. Delete it!
Delete what?
The picture looks great! Ouch!
Delete it!
Stop it, mom!
The picture looks great!
You'll see what I'll do
with this tablet.
- Give it.
- I will not!
What do you want?
- Are you filming me?
- Of course not, mom!
You're filming?!
You bastard!
I wanted to go
to the party, take a shower
and you're pestering me?
- Give me my tablet.
- Get out!
I'll pin you to the wall,
just like I did with Juliana.
Give me my tablet.
- Against the wall.
- Give it back!
- I won't!
- Get back here!
Give it back! Trying to hide
behind the door, huge woman.
Huge is your ass,
your tongue, you son of a bitch.
Give me my tablet!
Paulo Gustavo, here.
Do anything you want.
I'll gather the press.
