THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY
"The action begins in Toledo, in 1808,
during the city's occupation
by Napoleon's army.
It is inspired by a tale
by Gustavo A. Becquer,
the Spanish romantic poet".
Prisoners against the wall!
First row, take your positions!
Ready, aim... -
Down with liberty!
Death to the French!
Fire!
I'm hungry.
Despite his wound,
and bent on revenge against the knight,
the captain wagered his fellow officers
that he could bring Dona Elvira's
mortal remains to his bed.
Nothing could deter him from his intent,
and one night
he carried out his macabre plan.
The mysterious hand of death
had spared her face,
which had remained
as fresh and delicate as a rose.
They found her
beneath her tombstone
amid her repugnant paraphernal... -
What's that?
"Paraphernalia".
Is that a sweet-smelling herb?
Is it a rosary?
- Not that either.
It's a legal term for the personal
property of a married woman.
But in English, the word "paraphernalia"
has a much broader meaning.
It refers to any accoutrements,
belongings, personal items,
even fishing gear
or a sewing kit.
- Where were you?
- We went biking over the bridge.
We're going to the slide.
We're going soon.
We'll come get you.
You slid down so nicely.
I think I know you.
What's your name?
Vé
- And you?
- Valé
Yes, of course.
Since you two are so nice,
I'm going to give you a charming gift.
Come with me... -
- Our bikes are over there.
Let's go.
And now,
I'm going to show you
some very pretty pictures.
But you mustn't
show them to anyone.
If you want them,
you have to promise.
Just look.
They're for you.
Show them to your friends.
But no grown-ups.
You'll remember that?
I'm sick of symmetry.
Henri.
Back already?
What do you mean?
I never went out.
Don't you feel well?
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm on edge, tired.
It's true.
I've noticed it myself lately.
Since Vé
on vacation this week,
let's go down to the seashore.
Why the sea?
The sea's no longer the sea.
Hello, Mommy.
Look what someone gave me.
I passed you in the street yesterday
and you didn't even recognize me.
I haven't been sleeping well lately.
I haven't mentioned it,
but sometimes I lie awake all night.
You should get a checkup,
just to be sure.
Don't say "checkup".
There's a proper French term for it:
General examination.
It's too long.
"General examination".
Checkup is much quicker.
What's the hurry?
Françoise!
Come here.
Where did you get these?
- A nice man gave them to me.
So, you let her talk to strangers?
I didn't see anything.
I didn't know.
The man seemed very nice.
He even offered us candy.
I've warned you before.
If you ever accept anything
from a stranger again,
watch out!
Time for her snack.
- Yes, madam.
This is disgraceful!
Let me see.
Can you imagine!
Disgusting, but what can you do?
I'm at my wits' end.
I can't always keep an eye on her.
Look at this.
Remember? It was in Milan.
At your parents' home.
We were too young.
But it was magnificent!
And you didn't want to... -
Vé
Incredible.
Revolting.
- Sickening!
- What can you expect nowadays?
This one could pass.
This one is indecent.
That may be okay for old fogies,
but not for me.
No, not this!
- Let me see.
- What for?
Why not?
Let me see it.
You're right.
This is going too far.
Call the maid.
Françoise.
I'm going to skip dinner tonight
and turn in early.
You should see a doctor. I insist.
- Here, you can keep them.
- Thanks, Daddy.
May I trade them
for some spider pictures?
If you like.
Madam called?
After today's incident,
it's best you leave us.
But I had nothing to do with it.
I didn't know... -
Settle things with my wife,
then get out.
I'm sorry, but under the circumstances,
there's nothing I can do.
Of course, you can stay the night.
Let's work out what we owe you.
- This one's a water spider.
- Very good, darling.
I drew that one.
It's a wolf spider.
No, darling,
it's a trapdoor spider.
A species you won't find in France,
sad to say.
Hé
That's enough.
That really is enough.
I'm sorry, Mr. Foucauld,
but this isn't my specialty.
We're both wasting our time.
But what should I do?
Physically,
there's nothing wrong with you.
If you want to discuss your dreams,
see a psychoanalyst.
He'll listen to you... -
for months, years, if he has to.
Doctor, it wasn't a dream.
I have the postman's letter.
Look.
- Doctor?
- What?
May I see you a moment?
Can't it wait?
It's rather urgent.
Excuse me.
My father is very sick.
What's wrong with him?
He's already had two attacks.
He's old.
I'd like to go see him.
We're very busy right now.
Will you be away long?
A couple of days.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
- All right, then.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Excuse me, did you see
any foxes on the road?
Foxes? No.
- No foxes crossing the road?
- I didn't see a thing.
What'd I tell you!
No foxes around here.
Never were!
I had firsthand information, sir.
Maybe it's the storm.
And we still have 30 miles to go.
Enough time wasted! Let's go.
Excuse me,
are you going toward Argenton?
Be careful. There was a landslide
and the road may be out.
Good-bye, ma'am.
Let's go!
May I use your phone?
The line's down because of the floods.
- What will I do now? Do you have a room?
- Of course. Front or back?
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving early.
Would you like supper?
No, just some milk and fruit.
I'll just be a minute.
Go and dry off.
What hellish weather!
It seems the Argenton road is out.
Have a seat, madam.
We're stranded here too.
- Are you from around here?
- My family is. And you?
St. Joseph's Monastery.
You must know it.
I've been there with my father.
I'm going to see him. He's sick.
Who knows if I'll find him alive.
What's wrong with him?
I'm afraid for him.
The heart.
The disease of our times.
The bustle, the anxiety,
the traveling.
My father runs a small farm.
He never travels.
He doesn't read the papers.
He doesn't have a phone.
If everybody prayed to St. Joseph
and spent 30 minutes a day
in meditation,
we'd all be perfectly relaxed.
Surely.
Whenever you're ready.
This way.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like an extra blanket?
No, I sleep with the windows shut.
Is there hot water?
- Of course.
Shall I wake you?
- No need.
Then good night, ma'am.
Who is it?
It's Father Gabriel.
I'd like a word with you.
Just a moment.
Good evening, madam.
May I?
Do you know what this is?
- Yes. It's an image.
A miraculous image of St. Joseph.
It can have surprising effects
on the sick.
- Really?
- I'm thinking of your father.
Faith can sometimes triumph
where science has failed.
We just saw
the Marquise de la Pomarè
Yesterday she was near death.
We brought her the image.
We prayed.
This morning
when we left the chateau... -
- She was cured?
- She felt a little better.
You play cards, madam?
Sometimes, when I'm alone.
I play solitaire.
So do I. It's very relaxing.
That must be the fathers.
And now, with your permission,
we shall pray for your father.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'm deeply touched.
Would you like a rosary?
Yes, thank you.
Let us meditate tonight
on the sorrowful mystery
of Christ's agony
on the Mount of Olives.
Our Father, who art in heaven...
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
- I'm in.
- Raise you 10.
- Pass.
- I'll see you and raise you a scapular.
I open.
- How many cards?
- Two.
Virgins are 10
and sacred hearts are 25, right?
Yes, and scapulars are 50.
I open with a virgin.
Full house, jacks over eights.
Didn't you say your father
once lived in the colonies?
No. He never left
these parts. Why?
Oh, nothing.
Place your bets.
She was so mischievous.
Who?
A pious lady who used to visit us.
Her husband was in the army.
- What about her?
- Nothing, nothing.
Father Gabriel.
I didn't say anything unusual.
Those must be the late guests
I was expecting.
If you'll excuse me.
Which is higher,
a flush or a straight?
A flush.
Then I raise you 10.
- Is our room ready?
- Yes. It's very nice.
You have a view of the mountain.
Very quiet.
It's late, but if you want dinner,
a snack or a sandwich... -
No, thank you. The lady is tired.
We'll get some rest.
Take their luggage up.
What time would you like breakfast?
We'll come down.
Would madam like anything?
A bottle of mineral water?
Nothing, thank you.
Good night.
Alea jacta est.
What do you mean?
That this is wonderful.
Come sit next to me. Come on.
- The things you make me do... -
- Don't be nervous.
You heard the man.
It's very quiet here.
- Too quiet.
- Sit down.
Take off your glasses.
What's wrong?
You seemed so happy about coming.
- Why did I listen to you?
- How I've waited for this.
Please, François, take me home.
Why did you come then?
Because I can't refuse you anything.
For once we're alone,
without my mother,
my brothers, my sisters.
It had become unbearable, having you
near me, always having to lie.
For me as well, François.
But how can we avoid lying?
Sit down here.
All my life, I've felt you close to me.
Your perfume, your presence.
The times I held you on my lap
when you were a child.
When I think of a woman,
it's always you I see.
Of all my nephews,
I've always loved you the best.
Remember that Holy Thursday,
sitting side by side
in the church's dim light?
Your hand was resting on the pew.
Gently, I put my hand on yours
and squeezed it.
I felt your fingers close around mine.
I didn't dare believe it.
I waited for a moment.
Then I looked at you.
You looked at me
and leaned toward me,
and we kissed for the first time.
We couldn't help ourselves.
I won't touch you.
But there's one thing
I want more than anything.
What?
- To see you naked.
- Impossible.
- I won't leave here until I do.
- I couldn't.
I've never been naked in front of a man.
No man has ever touched me.
Take off your clothes.
If you refuse,
you know I'll stop at nothing.
Shit!
Take off your clothes.
You promise you won't touch me?
Lock the door.
Turn around.
It's no good. I can't do it.
- But you said... -
- I said nothing!
What's got into you? Stop it!
You swear you won't touch me?
I swear.
Turn around.
What must they be thinking at home?
They'll be waiting for us.
You know your mother.
She's so easily worried.
They may think we had an accident.
What with the phone lines down...
Well, too bad. We'll see.
Are you ready?
You can turn around if you want.
For pity's sake, François.
Don't be frightened.
Let me.
You swore.
One second.
It's better like this, isn't it?
Let go of me or I'll scream!
Help!
I'll light your way.
Just light a candle
and the power comes back.
Going downstairs?
- To the bar.
The bar's closed.
Come to my room. We were
just about to open some port.
Yes, come in. Just for a minute.
Please do.
Do come in.
My dear,
allow me to introduce Mr...
François de Richemont.
- Miss Rosenblum.
- Pleased to meet you.
The pleasure's mine.
My name is Jean Bermans.
Do sit down.
Are you from Paris?
Yes. Are you?
No, I'm a hatter from Nîmes.
Miss Rosenblum is my associate.
Are you in business too?
- No, I'm a student.
- What are you studying?
I'm graduating high school.
Lucky young fellow.
I have fond memories
of my student days.
If only I could have gone to college.
But in Ostend, you know... -
Are you here alone?
No, I'm with... -
my mother.
Perhaps she'd care to join us.
I don't think so.
She's not feeling well.
One moment.
I'm sorry, but I heard voices.
I'm looking for matches.
Come in.
Sit down for a minute.
Yes, but...
I'm with four gentlemen.
Four gentlemen?
We might invite them in too.
That would be lovely.
Will you show me to your room?
- Yes, but... -
- Come.
Which door?
- That one.
She didn't tell me
the gentlemen were... -
But it's no problem.
On the contrary.
Jean Bermans.
Gentlemen, I'd be honored if you'd come
have some port in my room.
In your room?
- That's very kind of you, but... -
- I'd be so pleased.
It's late. We were going to bed.
We must celebrate the chance
that brought us together.
- Celebrate what?
- Chance. Come along.
Come along, please.
This way.
After you.
Please go in.
You must be Dominicans?
- No, Carmelites.
- That's a relief.
My dear Edith,
isn't this a stroke of luck?
This is Miss Rosenblum.
- Pleased to meet you.
Edith, pour us some port, will you?
Mr. De Richemont,
will you give me a hand?
It's a bit cramped in here, but no matter.
We love these little impromptus.
We're going to have a charming time,
if you have no objections.
Excuse me.
Mr. Bermans,
haven't we met before?
I don't think so.
You never lived in the Congo?
The Belgian Congo.
- I've never been to Africa. Why?
- No reason.
- The weather's improving.
- It's about time.
Personally, I love Africa.
St. Christopher was never
any help to me.
- Naturally, madam.
- Why's that?
He's no longer a saint.
Nor are St. George and some others.
The church has become very strict
about sainthood.
But isn't that damaging to the faith?
On the contrary. It reinforces it.
Sainthood isn't like some badge.
You've no doubt heard of Savonarola?
- Wasn't he a Dominican?
- Indeed, and an illustrious one.
Savonarola was tried
and condemned as a heretic.
He's completely rehabilitated now.
Soon he may even be sanctified.
While other saints will disappear?
Yes, it appears that
St. Thé
St. Thé
How could they?
That's the rumor going around Rome.
We now know that Theresa's parents
had a hereditary disease
when she and her many brothers
and sisters were conceived.
What will become of the basilica?
A church like all the others.
And the Virgin of Lourdes?
Same thing?
No. There never was a real miracle
at Lisieux, whereas in Lourdes... -
Go on, beat me, you old slut!
Harder! Again! That's it!
Harder!
I'm a swine!
I'm filth!
Beat me, you filthy trollop!
I'm foul!
A leper!
Again!
No, wait! Don't go!
Let the monks stay, at least!
- Allow me, ma'am.
- Yes, take him.
Thank you for your hospitality.
If it's the cane he wants,
I'll give it to him!
Calm down, Father!
You must rest up.
This way.
Come.
Do what you want with me!
You're the first one up.
- Is the phone working?
- Not yet, but the Argenton roads open.
- Is my bill ready?
- Of course.
Excuse me.
Are you going to Argenton?
Can you give me a lift?
The bus isn't due for two hours.
- I'd be glad to.
- Thank you.
Here you are.
Do you need the bill?
Allow me.
I'll tell you where to drop me off.
Here he comes!
Look out, he's coming!
Take your seats.
Be seated.
THE COLONEL IS A CUCKOLD
THE CAPTAIN IS A PANSY
Who wrote this?
I repeat: Who wrote this?
You won't answer?
Then I'll have to report it.
It's incredible.
At your age,
you still act like children.
Duval, erase that.
And close the door.
We were discussing,
in our last class,
the notion of laws
and misdemeanors.
We saw how the aim of laws
is to maintain social order.
Naturally, they're subject to change
from one country to another,
from one age to another.
In fact,
they are merely conventions.
The same goes
for customs and morals.
Take polygamy, for example... -
Target practice!
Group 3!
As I was saying,
morals are subject to change
like laws.
So, polygamy...
which is the norm in some societies,
is taboo in ours.
On this subject, I refer you
to Margaret Meads works... -
I repeat: Mead, M-E-A-D... -
on sexual practices in Melanesia.
These books... -
I'm not starting over for latecomers.
I was talking about the works
of Margaret Mead
on sexual practices in Melanesia.
I was saying that these works... -
Accident on highway 767!
With all these comings and goings,
I lost the thread.
Ah, I was saying that these works,
which are in the barracks library,
will help you better understand
the relativity of customs
and, consequently, of laws.
When you compare one culture
to another,
it's all a question of viewpoint.
Everyone is always
someone else's barbarian.
What's more,
as far as the relativity
of customs and laws is concerned... -
The gasworks just blew up!
General alarm!
Aren't you going with the others?
- We're on arctal ructive duty.
- On what?
Arctal ructive duty.
I see. And you?
- Me, too.
- Very well.
With all these interruptions...
I lost the thread.
I think that everything
I just explained to you
will help you better understand
the relativity
of customs and laws.
You're well aware that it's often
a question of changing the laws.
We also hear a lot about an evolution
that is leading to changes in customs
and morals.
Hey, look at this.
RED DAILY
Workers Sound the Alarm!
Attention!
- Colonel.
- Go ahead.
I was told the class
was a bit restless today. We'll see.
Sit down.
Carry on.
There's a good deal of talk
about changing our morals.
Some people are even calling
for a general upheaval.
But the consequences of such
a disturbance could prove intolerable,
even horrifying.
I'll pick an example at random.
My wife and I are invited
over to some friends...
- We thought you'd never make it.
- You can't imagine the traffic.
We nearly began without you.
- You should have.
- You're not serious!
Why, here's Sophie!
Sweetheart, how are you?
How you've grown!
Everything fine at school?
You know Mrs. Calmette.
If you'll just follow me...
Let's see.
Mrs. Calmette, you sit there.
Elizabeth, here.
You, Professor, at my right.
Charles, between Elizabeth
and Mrs. Calmette.
And you, Sophie darling,
sit on my left.
Do sit down.
We went to see Tristan and Isolde
the other day.
- Was it good?
- Splendid.
Carlotta Igellicci was heartrending.
What a voice! What presence!
It's a shame she's put on weight.
Care for a cigarette?
I'd love one, thanks.
- How was your trip to Spain?
- Interesting.
But... -
- But?
We had to come home early.
Madrid was filled with the stench of... -
pardon my language... -
food.
It was indecent.
What will our planet be like in 20 years
with the current population explosion?
It makes you think.
What are you referring to?
Consider the quantity of toxic products
we dump into our rivers.
Insecticides, detergents,
all the industrial residue.
- Not to mention bodily wastes.
- Of course.
There are almost
four billion people on earth.
In 20 years there'll be
seven billion of us.
Seven billion!
And how much bodily waste
do you think a person discharges daily?
I don't know.
Half a pound, maybe?
Much more!
Urine is heavier than water.
All told, I'd say
at least three pounds.
Multiplied by four billion,
that makes more than
12 billion pounds a day.
In 20 years,
more than 22 billion pounds!
- Ten million tons of excrement a day?
- Exactly.
My word!
That's really alarming!
How many tons did you say?
More than 10 million tons a day.
And such waste is extremely toxic.
Its damaging effect is increased
by the presence of chemicals.
Just try peeing
into your fish tank every day
and you'll understand.
Mommy, I'm really hungry.
Sophie, it's bad manners
to talk like that at the table!
Excuse me a moment.
Where's the dining room, please?
Last door on the right.
It's occupied!
Sorry!
What is it?
Colonel, we go on duty at 11:00 a.m.
Go ahead then.
Driver's license and registration.
- Don't you know the speed limit?
- I was doing under 40.
Really?
And the seat belt is compulsory.
I know. I wasn't thinking.
Have you seen your tires?
You're not only endangering
your own life
but that of other drivers.
I have a doctor's appointment in Paris.
Are you kidding me?
Consider yourself lucky
I don't impound your car.
Richard, how are you feeling,
old man?
No better, no worse.
- And your wife and little girl?
- Fine, thank you.
You must come over
for dinner some evening.
We'd like that.
Sit down.
Did you bring the test results?
Let's have a look.
Glucose: 130.
Cholesterol, fine.
Uric acid... urea...
good.
Very good.
Your results are better than mine.
Now for the electrocardiogram.
Normal.
You smoke a lot?
- A pack a day.
Too much.
And you lead a hectic life.
Keep it up and in three or four years
you'll end up in a wheelchair.
Let's look at the X rays.
This area here is clear, see?
There's a small spot here.
We could take another X ray
to be sure.
And those white spots?
Oh, nothing.
Catherine met your wife the other day.
So you're not going south this summer?
If I'm not feeling well,
we'll stay in Paris.
All right. Well?
One thing.
I'd like to make a small incision.
Sheer medical curiosity.
- Big?
- This long.
Is it an operation?
Just to see.
When?
Whenever you want.
When you have time.
Is tomorrow okay with you?
Tomorrow? Is it that urgent?
It's always best to do these things
as soon as possible.
What's wrong?
It's up to you,
but personally,
I'd like to have a look.
Look, Pierre,
I'm not a child anymore.
If it's something serious,
you can tell me.
I like patients like you.
You have a neoplasm.
I see.
What's that?
A growth of new tissue.
Or, if you prefer, cancer.
What?
You have cancer of the liver.
Cancer, me?
At a fairly advanced stage.
But nowadays, you know,
these things...
Cigarette?
What did Dr. Pasolini say?
It's nothing.
Oh, good.
That's a relief.
I was a bit worried, you know.
Did he start you on treatment?
- No, nothing.
Isn't Aliette here?
She's at school now.
Yes, speaking.
What did you say?
When? How?
That's impossible.
We'll be right over.
- What is it?
- Aliette's disappeared.
- What?
- She's disappeared from school.
There must be an explanation.
Did the nanny take her?
Yes. She just got back.
She didn't say a thing.
Brigitte!
Exactly what happened?
I don't know.
We don't understand it.
- You're sure she's disappeared?
- I don't know.
What makes it so odd
is that she and the others
were under constant supervision.
And she was always there.
Come with me. I'll show you.
"Will we see him...
come back?"
This is Mr. And Mrs. Legendre,
Aliette's parents.
When the children came into class,
the teacher counted them.
There were 22 girls, as usual.
Five minutes later,
she noticed Aliette wasn't there.
She called me right away.
- Could she have run away?
- Impossible.
The concierge was categorical:
No pupil left.
It's incredible.
Isn't anyone in charge?
Sit down.
I counted them too.
I took the enrollment list
and called the roll.
I've lost faith in this school.
- Mommy.
- Be quiet. What do you want?
I'm here.
Be quiet when the headmistress
is talking. Understand?
Now go back to your seat.
I'll call the roll for you.
You'll see.
Legendre, Aliette.
Here.
You see? She's there.
And all the others are there?
All of them. I checked.
You looked everywhere?
We searched the entire school.
Nothing.
Good Lord!
What could have happened to her?
If you think we'll accept
your feeble explanation, you're wrong.
We must notify the police at once.
- Where's your coat?
- In the hall.
Show them in.
Please come in.
Do sit down.
You are Mr. Legendre?
Yes. Thanks for seeing us
so quickly.
Not at all.
What can I do for you?
- Our daughter has disappeared.
- When?
About an hour ago,
when she got to school.
The nanny took her as usual.
When the teacher called the roll,
she was there.
They searched the entire school,
but obviously they didn't find her.
Do you have any enemies?
Anyone who would wish you harm?
I don't think so.
You're a man who's fairly... -
I mean, if it's a kidnapping,
do you have the means
to pay a ransom?
Yes, of course.
I see. Is there a witness?
The nanny.
You took this child to school?
Yes, sir. But I don't know a thing.
It wasn't me.
I left her at the gate,
like I always do. Didn't I, Aliette?
That's right.
It was like every day.
She left me at the gate.
You'll speak when you're questioned.
First we'll fill out
a missing persons form.
You did well to bring her.
It helps.
Come here, child.
Now then...
Legendre. Your first name?
Race... white.
- Age?
- Eight and a half.
Marital status... single.
Brown eyes.
Auburn hair.
Height?
3'6".
Weight?
Fifty-five pounds.
Wearing a blue coat,
black shoes, white socks.
Ask the sergeant to come in.
Issue an all-points bulletin for Paris.
We must find this child.
- This her?
- Yes, why?
- Can't we take her along?
- No need.
Just take a good look at her,
then get to work.
Sergeant,
your shoes are far from spotless!
You're right. I didn't have time to... -
So there's no need to worry.
We're pulling out all the stops.
Contact us if you hear anything,
even if you're warned against it.
Count on me.
- Thank you, Inspector.
- Don't mention it.
A fine-looking dog you have.
You keep him tied up all day?
- I let him run free from time to time.
With all this traffic?
He's used to it.
- What's his name?
- Chico.
Good boy!
The bastards who mistreat animals
should be drowned.
That's what the Gospel says...
more or less.
What's the matter?
There he is!
It's him.
The open window on the top floor.
I'll call in.
Court is in session.
The defendant will rise.
All right, all right.
Here are the judgments
on the charges
and the verdict.
On the charge of first-degree murder
the jury replied guilty,
by a majority
of at least eight votes.
As to extenuating circumstances,
the jury found none,
by a majority
of at least eight votes.
Under Articles 295,
296, 297, 302, and 304,
and Article 12 of the Penal Code,
the court,
having deliberated
in accordance with the law,
sentences Bernard Levasseur
to death.
Court is adjourned.
May I have your autograph?
Me too.
The trial of the killer poet
lasted 14 months.
Meanwhile, the search
for the little girl continued.
Then, one day...
Mr. Commissioner,
Mr. Legendre is here.
Show him in.
- Mr. Commissioner.
- Sit down.
After all this time,
you may have started losing hope.
I have good news at last.
You did it!
I don't believe it.
Bring her in.
Sit down, madam.
- I waited two hours for you.
- I couldn't help it.
- Why didn't you phone?
- I couldn't.
Commissioner,
I don't know how to thank you.
Was she well treated?
She had everything she needed,
didn't she?
Everything. As usual.
How did you find her?
I have the written statement.
I'll read it.
It's a rather unusual story.
"On the night of February 7,
the population of Lisieux
was awakened
by a deafening explosion.
When rescue workers arrived,
they were amazed to find... - "
1:30 already?
I'm sorry.
I have an urgent appointment.
Go ahead.
My secretary will read it to you.
Do you mind, Jacqueline?
Good-bye and excuse me.
Written statement:
"On the night of February 7,
the population of Lisieux was awakened
by a deafening explosion.
When rescue workers arrived,
they were amazed to find..."
Shall I wait, sir?
No, you're dismissed. Thank you.
What?
They're not here yet?
But the appointment was for 1:30.
Listen,
turn off that music, will you?
You can't go into a bar or restaurant
without hearing canned music.
Turn it off, will you?
- Yes, sir.
The usual?
Of course.
- Will you sit at the bar?
- No, I'll sit over there.
I'll have a glass of port.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but... -
Don't be afraid.
I'm the police commissioner.
Pleased to meet you.
May I sit with you for a minute?
Please do.
Your port, ma'am.
Your drink is at your table, sir.
- Leave it there.
You come here often?
- This is my first time.
I was troubled
when I saw you come in.
May I tell you why?
- If you wish.
Today is the fourth anniversary
of my sister's death.
I loved her deeply.
She looked exactly like you.
I thought you were her.
Same face, same voice, same walk.
Her name was Marguerite.
My name is Estelle.
One summer afternoon...
it was unbearably hot.
You still here?
Didn't you have an appointment?
- It's too hot to go.
Too hot!
You'll never amount to anything!
I don't think I'll go to Toulouse.
I'm going to tell Mother.
She'll be furious, but you're right.
These family dinners:
The aunts and cousins... -
what a bore!
I know.
What would I do in Toulouse
at 3:00 p. M?
Take a nap.
Do me a favor.
Play the Brahms Rhapsody.
If you like.
She never did go to Toulouse.
She died a few days later.
Do you play piano, too?
A little.
- You're not French?
- I was born in Italy.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
May I?
What did your sister die of?
The miserere colic.
What is that?
It's horrible,
especially in the final stages.
You end up vomiting excre... -
Excuse me.
- How awful.
Horrible.
I must be going,
But it was extraordinary
meeting you like this.
I'd like to see you again,
invite you to the Policemen's Ball.
I'd love to go.
A call for you, sir.
- Is it Marcel saying he's late?
- I don't think so.
No one else knows I'm here.
Shall I say I haven't seen you?
No. Ask who's calling.
Can't have a moment's peace.
Would you mind giving me
your name and address?
It's your sister, Marguerite, sir.
- What?
- She says she must speak to you.
Georges, tell her to go screw herself.
With your permission, madam.
This must be a sick joke.
My sister's been dead for four years.
But, sir...
she insists.
She wants to see you
tonight in the family vault.
She says the key's
in your right-hand desk drawer.
Why, that's true.
Ask her
what I requested she play
one hot summer day
when I went in her room.
The commissioner wants to know what
he asked you to play one hot summer day
when he went in your room.
The Brahms Rhapsody, sir.
Give me that.
Yes, speaking.
Who are you?
Learn the true mystery
of death tonight?
- What do you want?
- I want to come in.
It's closed.
I'm Mr. Richepin.
My family vault is here. Let me in.
You need a special authorization.
I'm the police commissioner.
Go in, then.
Shall I go with you?
No need. Stay here.
That's him!
- What are you doing? Let go!
- Take him away!
Don't you know who I am?
Hands off!
I'm the police commissioner!
- Explain it at the station.
- Let go, I said.
Stand at attention
and give me your badge numbers!
- The commissioner.
- Send him in.
Sit down.
I've been treated
in a most shameful manner.
I couldn't even call my home.
You were found last night
at the cemetery,
desecrating a crypt.
When arrested, you claimed
you were the police commissioner.
You know full well I am.
I order you to return
my belongings at once.
And take me to my office.
You'll hear about this!
Of course.
As we were saying,
desecration of a crypt.
It was my sister's casket.
Your sister?
I went to see my sister.
She phoned me!
Back to his cell.
Get me the police commissioner.
It's urgent.
Hello, Mr. Commissioner?
Sorry to disturb you.
This is Inspector Dupuis.
We've arrested a fellow who claims
to be the police commissioner.
Claims to be the police commissioner?
How odd.
Does he look like me?
Is he pleasant?
Not at all.
I see.
Bring him here right away.
The commissioner will see you now.
There you are.
Come in. How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Fine, thanks.
That will be all, Inspector.
Thank you.
Won't you sit there?
I'm fine here.
Very well.
You there, and me here.
Two glasses of scotch.
You've put on weight.
- So have you.
- All those official dinners.
- Always eating and drinking.
We ought to refuse.
- Not easy.
What are you doing this morning?
- This morning, you know... -
- Ah, yes, the zoo. At noon.
I've taken precautions.
I've stationed
12 buses of riot police nearby.
But not grouped together.
Spread them out:
Some here, some there.
We mustn't alarm people.
The main thing is to keep them
from reaching the cages.
The locks have been
carefully checked.
And anyway, if some animals
are killed, tough luck.
Our men are more valuable
than a zebra.
To your health.
Down with liberty!
- Charge!
- And let 'em have it!
