Then, each athlete has scored
a yuko. 
[judo move]
The atmosphere for this final
round is very tense.
This is psychological warfare.
These initial tactics are used to 
check the opponent's state.
As I was saying, Go Du Yeong 
is using a foot technique. 
Nice! Nice! Just like that!
Very good. A positive tripping.
Pretty good try.
Go Du Yeong is working hard to
score more points. 
Go Du Yeong must not back down.
His opponent is making a
very aggressive attack.
A grip move!
A grip move!
Wow. A "waza-ari" has been
scored against Go Du Yeong.
Wow. A "waza-ari" has been
scored against Go Du Yeong.
He must first escape, then he
can possibly score a sequential
"waza-ari."
Go Du Yeong must escape.
Go Du Yeong has managed to
escape.
Okay, a foot sweep!
A foot sweep and he has a grip!
Very good
Du Yeong!
His optic nerve has had a 
serious injury. 
Optic nerve injury cannot be 
cured by transplantation or any 
other method.
Unfortunately,
he has completely lost his sight.
-=Hyeong=-
[older brother]
You applied again this year?
Yes, I'm back again.
If you are released on parole, 
how do you plan to live after
you get out?
Looking here,
you haven't gotten any 
qualification certificates?
Not only a qualification certificate,
I don't even have the 
qualification to get out of here.
They said I ran a business to
defraud people out of money.
When I think of the people who
suffered because of me...
Even after I serve my sentence, 
I'll still be in prison, right?
This...
Is it for your image?
How could it be?
People who have tried those tricks,
how will they face their God?
-=Judo athlete loses eyesight=-
Go Du Yeong?
Go Du Yeong?
But,
what is this?
This child,
is my younger brother.
Because I'm so useless, I 
never dared to mention it.
I didn't want to hurt my 
brother's reputation.
My parents passed away on
the same night.
Now my only brother has gone
blind...
I'm a terrible person.
I would gladly accept my 
punishment, but...
just thinking about this child, 
I can't even swallow my food.
All my brother can see must be
endless darkness.
I don't even know if he is 
eating on time.
That he's not sick!
The reason I applied for release 
on parole
is totally because of this child.
Yes.
I'll take this back.
I can't stop crying.
Go Du Yeong actually put a
glimmer of light into my life.
That hurts.
The first time I've been back 
here in 10 years.
Why should I have to climb
over a wall?
It's filthy.
It's like a haunted house.
Oh, it stinks.
Are you some little kid?
You won't even get up to 
open the front door.
Ah, that's right.
You're disabled, aren't you?
Get out.
I don't want to.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Get lost.
It's done.
I finally get to eat ramen in 
my own house!
I didn't expect you to be such
a help in my life.
Thanks, brat.
Before you get the call, you 
should know it's only for one year.
I didn't come here willingly, 
either.
It's just one year we have to
live together.
After that, I promise I'll 
disappear without a trace.
You rude jerk.
If a hyena comes into your 
home, you should at least 
come out to check.
But I wonder...
how much is this place worth
now?
It should be a lot.
How much money do you have?
Hey!
Your mom must have left you 
something before she died.
By the way, don't expect
anything.
Don't think I'm here to take
really good care of you!
If you're having naive thoughts
like that,
you should get rid of them as
soon as possible.
What was that?
Hey.
Let go!
If you can't get from the kitchen
to your room, what's the point?
I'll go to my room and you can 
do whatever you want.
Give me one pack Lamborghini 
Ice Tornado.
What?
Lamborghini Ice Tor... Tor... 
That.
Ajussi.
One box Lamborghini menthol,
please.
Ah, menthol.
That's what I just said.
Give me another one of those.
They're sold out.
Then that means...
you should put it down.
I already paid for it.
Lamborghini menthol.
I asked for it by its correct 
name,
Lamborghini Ice Tornado, okay?
Ajussi.
Keep the change!
Hey. Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you fucking bastard!
- Give it to me. 
- Okay, okay.
I'll give it to you. I'll give it 
to you.
This bastard wants to die.
Hey, you bastard.
The next time we meet is the
day you die!
Son of a bitch.
Now my stomach hurts.
What the hell?
Why now?
Damn, I really have to go.
You're an asshole!
You're just lucky I have to shit!
Du Yeong, it's me. Su Hyun.
Why don't you ever answer 
the phone?
I'm at your front door right now.
Are you at home...
It opened.
That hurts.
Du Yeong.
Du Yeong.
Wh-Wh-Who are you?
Who? Why did you hit me?
What the heck?
So what is your relationship?
Are you his girlfriend?
It looks like Du Yeong won't
eat anything.
He'll eat when he gets hungry.
He's not a child.
Don't talk about him like that!
Why are you shouting at me,
woman?
Du Yeong, let's eat.
What is that woman doing?
Du Yeong.
Du Yeong, get up. Let's eat...
Du Yeong, what's wrong?
Du Yeong, open your eyes!
Listen carefully.
I didn't come here to pay my 
last respects to you.
Don't make a big fuss.
If you really want to die, 
then die quietly.
Otherwise, eat and stay alive.
He said it's malnutrition.
Does malnutrition make any 
sense?
Do you think it only takes 
ability to be a national athlete?
A national athlete also needs
stamina.
Shouldn't you at least pay
attention whether he eats or not?
Then take him away.
Since you're so worried, 
just take him.
As his "coach", does it really 
matter if he's blind or not?
What do you mean by that?
You said he has the stamina of 
a national athlete.
That should do well.
Are you trash?
Because of that damn kid, my 
life really has become a pile 
of trash.
- Fucking seriously.
- Fucking seriously?
For patient Go Du Yeong,
please go take care of the bill.
The trash will leave first.
My card is maxed out...
I'm someone who doesn't even
have a card, understand?
Thinking about a card makes
me crazy, okay?
What kind of a bastard...
What kind of brother is that?
He doesn't have to be so rude.
No one could even tell that
he's your brother.
He's not my real brother.
No wonder.
That makes more sense.
Should I beat you? Huh?
Turning a good person into 
trash, is that fun?
Stop the show.
When it's time to eat, come in 
obediently and eat.
Stop pissing me off.
Is it fried ham?
It's Spam.
This jerk is too much.
Your eyes don't work and now
even your nose is broken?
No way is it Spam. 
[lunch meat brand]
Your entire existence is spam, 
kid. 
["junk email"]
Also,
you should be grateful I'm a
humanitarian.
You should thank heaven there
is rice to stuff into your mouth.
Ramen is rice now?
Are you disrespecting ramen?
Shin Ramyeon, Neoguri,
Haemul Ramyeon, Nagasaki...
So many varieties, you 
dumb ass.
What about you?
You grew up eating well, so it 
won't hurt you to eat this for 
10 more years.
So just shut up and eat.
Don't tell me what to eat.
Are you wearing cologne?
"You?" 
[not honorifics]
"You?"
You son of a bitch, that's not
how you talk to your brother.
Then calling me "son of a bitch"
is okay?
You son of a bitch!
Ow.
Your mouth...
I guess it still works, huh?
It would be nice if that didn't
work, either.
You ruined my appetite.
You...
asshole.
Can you see?
You can see a little bit, right?
You son of a bitch.
Some humanitarian.
Just a thug.
Hey!
What, asshole?
What? What? Asshole.
Son of a bitch.
That hurts.
I'm sorry, Customer.
Even if there is security, both
parties must be present to 
sign for the loan.
If there's a problem, you must
bring your brother's power of 
attorney form.
I need to have a power of 
attorney?
I'm sorry.
I mean, I'm his brother.
His older brother.
We're family...
Seriously.
Oh, squid strips.
Ajussi.
Are you out of Coke Zero?
Oh, here it is.
This much, right?
Add this on.
Where did my cola go?
Damn it!
Hey, hey, hey!
You're back. You're back. 
I warned you last time, didn't I?
The next time I saw you 
would...
would be your death day, so...
That was my cola first, see?
So, well...
You live in this neighborhood?
What if I do?
Then...
Let's make a rule.
Whoever pays for it, gets it.
Okay?
What kind of work do you do?
Why do you need to know?
What do you think I do?
I-I didn't ask.
I'm not interested.
What are you talking about?
That means go figure it out
yourself,
old man.
Give me my cola!
Omo. What to do?
I'm sorry. Your suit. Aigoo.
It's time to light the incense.
[funeral ceremony]
Light the incense!
Don't be like this!
Don't chase me! Don't chase me!
You're the neighborhood 
nutjob!
The next time I see you, you
asshole, your mother will be 
burning incense!
Nothing goes smoothly.
What's with those pants?
It's getting mushy. It's mushy
already.
Eat it. Okay.
You...
It smells like sweet and sour 
pork, right?
Sweet and sour pork. Here.
Have a bite. Open up.
What are you doing?
What do you think?
I'm watching you waste away.
It really makes me feel bad.
A fork would be better, right?
Wait a second.
Okay, here's a fork.
Here's a fork. Here's a fork.
Here. Say "ah".
Then you feed yourself.
You can do that.
Here, it's in front of you.
That's a carrot.
That's cucumber. Cucumber.
Cucumber.
Left. Left.
I'm not eating.
I'll just stab it for you.
Eat.
It's good. It's good, right?
It must be good!
I told you so.
Okay! How about the black
bean noodles?
It's starting to get mushy.
You know you have to eat it 
before it gets too mushy.
Here, dig in.
Wow! You eat well, little
brother!
You can really eat.
This is from Yangjagang, right?
Yangjagang?
Are you a ghost?
[how did you know?]
You are a ghost.
Wow, you're really amazing.
By the way...
Our father and your mom,
that columbarium said they
want to move their ashes.
Because of that...
we need to submit some 
documents.
I can't sign by myself, since
you're also their child.
So I need a...
is it power of attorney?
They said I need to bring that.
Anyway, it's a big hassle.
I guess just to do something
so small,
the procedures are still very
complicated.
So?
Where is your seal?
Why does the columbarium need 
my seal to move their ashes?
What do you mean, you 
bastard?
Looking at your reaction just now,
you must think I'm going to
do something dishonest, 
is that it?
Wow, I'm really disappointed!
Seriously.
Wow.
Hey...
No matter what you think, why
would I use your seal like that?
Just forget it then!
We'll just let them take those
two old people's ashes,
and sprinkle them in the 
Yangjaecheon stream.
What I said,
I didn't mean it like that.
Please confirm it.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
You've worked hard.
It's under 3000 cc, so it has 
the best fuel economy.
Take a look.
This opens!
This, there's this. It should be
able to open, right?
First time in a car like this?
So for this one, how much is it?
Just a moment.
You give a discount for the
disabled, right?
What?
Try it. A macaroon.
Guess where I bought them.
Icheon-dong.
They're good, right?
Those are your favorites.
Du Yeong.
Judo... keep practicing.
I can't see anything, so how 
can I practice judo?
Don't misunderstand and just
listen to me first.
I've been checking into...
the Paralympic national team.
If you get selected,
you will be able to...
I've lived in this house for 
20 years,
but I can't even find my 
own room.
You want me to keep practicing
judo?
What do you think that's called?
That's called disability 
overconfidence.
My temple.
No, no. You can't drink that.
The best kind of beauty
is dumb beauty.
Your shoes are loud.
Oppa...
this is your house?
You're so cute, so cute.
Our house has a mad dog.
It will be noisy if you wake it.
Just take my hand quietly.
Talk softly.
This way, this way.
Oppa! A ghost, a ghost!
You're sitting here?
Oppa.
The mad dog is a man?
A mad dog?
I meant that...
No.
It's not like that.
Before this mad dog bites you,
you'd better get out of here.
This kid, talking to your 
brother like that.
Who do you think...
Hey, hey, hey.
Where are you going? Cutie!
Hey, Baby!
Bastard.
People should have at least
some common sense.
If you have common sense, you
don't need education, money or
whatever. Fuck.
Just because you're fucking
disabled, I'm screwed.
I was trying to be a good
example for you, you fucker.
Then you turn on me like that?
So damn annoying.
Gui-dong Community Center.
Who are you talking to?
Yes, hello. You came to my
house the other day.
This is Go Du Yeong.
You asked me if I would be 
interested in rehabilitation.
I've been thinking about it.
Compared to how I am now, it
would probably be good for me.
I'm curious about something.
If a criminal was given parole
just to take care of me,
will he be sent back to prison?
He doesn't help me at all.
You crazy bastard.
Are you an insane asshole?
You're driving me crazy!
I was doing fine without you.
Please get the hell out.
That jerk just had a temper
tantrum.
Hello?
Du Yeong is wasting his ability.
In the Paralympics, at least he 
would still be involved in sports.
As his brother, explain that
to him.
He said he doesn't want to, 
so why should I?
That's why you need to 
persuade him!
You live together, so keep 
encouraging him.
I don't have that much free time.
You must be a gangster.
What?
As his brother, your car is 
pretty fancy.
Where did you get the money
to buy it?
You even put Du Yeong's 
disabled person sticker on it.
Someone who's so busy has 
time to take care of all of that?
I think you're interested in me.
I don't care about sports.
Are you out of your mind?
Then why don't you mind your
own business?
He's so scared, he doesn't dare
step outside.
You're not his full brother, 
but this is still outrageous.
You're still his older brother.
As an older brother, you...
If you're giving out advice, 
I have something else to do.
There are plenty of families who
get along without blood ties.
Family members, my ass.
Maybe that child was bored, 
so he played a little joke.
No matter how well I treat him,
I can't erase the psychological
trauma he suffered.
Go Du Yeong, are you eating
properly?
Shin Ramyeon.
Neoguri.
Nagasaki.
When he was alone, he couldn't
even cook ramen.
I saw him breaking up and 
eating the dry noodles.
He begged me to cook every 
brand for him. Here's a drink.
If you have difficulty with meals, 
you can apply for assistance.
We can provide kimchi and 
other side dishes for support.
You're doing good work.
Your younger brother,
because of the change in his 
situation may possibly develop
depression.
With you by his side,
it would be good for you to 
accompany him on walks.
Enjoy being in the sunshine.
I'm going in.
Sit out here in the sun, kid.
She said you have depression.
I'm depressed because of you.
And you really piss me off too!
Prison or family, it's all the 
same. Fuck it.
Don't you have...
anyplace you want to go?
Didn't you say the columbarium 
moved?
I want to go there.
You want to go there with me?
You and me?
We're so close, right?
Those genes were heartless.
You're fine. Your mother was
also fine.
If you don't want to, then forget
it. Stop bitching about it.
Shut up, asshole.
Do you remember?
The Jongsu public baths.
In Yangjagang?
When dad got paid,
mom and dad,
you and me,
would bathe there.
Then we'd eat black bean 
noodles.
I don't remember.
After you left, we never went
again.
When I kept pestering him to go,
he said we had to wait until 
you came back.
What are you talking about?
You think we all lived happily
after you left, don't you?
Maybe it was because you
were an adolescent.
Maybe you wanted to be a 
success before you came back.
I dreamed up every kind of 
excuse to understand you.
But you still never came back.
At 18 years old, I had to handle
my parents' funeral all alone.
That's when I gave up.
Our relationship was really over.
I won't report you to the prison, 
so don't worry.
You can leave easily.
By now, I can take care of 
myself.
Get up.
Hey, get up.
I said get up, you jerk.
What are you doing?
Get up.
- Come on, up.
- Quit!
Get up now.
This damn kid.
Do as you're told. Get up.
Get up.
Damn it!
I was going to take you to the
sauna, you jerk.
To wash...
Soak for a while, kid.
Go Du Yeong's layer of dead 
skin from the past 10 years 
must be unbelievable.
No.
I want to go back home.
You said you wanted to come.
Since we're here, just get 
a scrub.
Hurry and undress.
You grew up pretty well.
What are you doing?
Crazy jerk.
You really do see a little,
you asshole.
It's obvious you can see.
Wow, that jerk.
Wow, look at all this dead skin!
It will probably clog the drain.
Just be quiet and scrub.
This is cool, right?
Can't you tell I'm an expert?
Did you just eat and scrub 
backs?
Kid,
before I went to prison,
I hid inside a public bath for 
a year.
I helped scrub people's backs
for a whole year.
That's how a jerk who ran away
from home was able to live.
I was a waiter, porter, even a
beauty salon assistant,
just to get a mouthful of food.
Then why did you run away 
from home?
Your brain is useless if you
don't understand.
My mom and you didn't get
along, right?
Your mom treated me very well.
After your mother walked in
the door,
I had the best lunch in my 
whole class.
At lunch time,
the moms would arrive with
udong noodles.
your mom was usually first.
I still remember what she 
sent me.
But,
one day the ajumma who 
lived next door
came over and talked to me.
She woke me up.
She said how could I be so
stupid?
Why?
Why?
She said, "That woman that 
you call mother. That woman..."
"is the woman who nursed your
mom before she died."
She said if my mom looked 
down from heaven,
she would probably feel she
died unfairly and hate me.
So, I got fucking angry and 
ran away, why?
The two of them had been 
praying for my mother's early 
death.
That's what I thought, kid.
Why did you ask that?
You pulled out my dark
secret.
Scrub in a different place!
It looks like I'm using an 
eraser on your back!
No matter how much I scrub, 
the dead skin doesn't stop.
I'm probably bleeding by now.
Seriously, kid.
My hands will bleed from
scrubbing you.
There's so much.
What's this back?
How did it get so broad? 
You used to be a little shrimp.
That "pepper" didn't have a
single hair.
[penis]
Now it's already filled in 
thick and black.
No good.
Let's go.
I have plenty.
You have a lot of sportswear.
A man's clothing is important,
kid.
Du Yeong.
Are you okay?
He shouldn't be standing in
the road.
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?
What?
Me?
Yes, you.
It's obvious. I'm shopping.
Who do you think you are?
If you knock over a blind person, 
shouldn't you apologize?
Blind person?
If he's blind, where's his 
walking stick?
Why does he go out without a
stick just to cause problems?
I mean, when you come across
a disabled person, just be kind.
Shouldn't you have that 
basic humanity?
That's really annoying.
This jerk.
So young.
Young, my ass.
I'm older than your girlfriend,
old man.
Who do you think you are?
Why are you hanging around
with a blind kid?
I'm his older brother. 
What about it?
Let's just go.
Stay right there.
Somebody disabled shouldn't
pretend to be normal.
Hold on.
What...?
What did you say about 
"disabled"?
If he can't see,
he should go stand alone in a
corner.
If you have eyes,
watch out for people when
you're walking.
Don't tell me your eyes...
are only used to look at 
young girls?
I told you to apologize.
After you pay for your things, 
then apologize to my brother,
old man.
You fucker.
Customer!
Don't fight.
I barely touched him.
You all planned this, didn't you?
What's going on?
I just barely touched him.
He seems seriously hurt.
I told you to let it go.
He's all in a cold sweat.
What to do?
Wait a second. Oh, my stomach...
Are you all right?
I really didn't mean to!
It's just that he was...
I just barely touched him!
It really was his fault, making 
a scene about nothing!
Please lower your voice.
You should understand the
reason.
That's his brother.
He's disabled...
Look.
He has a physical disability.
It's all my fault.
I wanted to buy my brother
some clothes,
so I forced him to go out.
I only...
want him to succeed in a world
full of prejudice. That's why I
brought him out!
Unfortunately, there's so much
discrimination...
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry.
It's all because of me.
It must really hurt.
I'm over here, you idiot!
You're worried about me at a
time like this, you idiot?
Come here.
Okay.
Just see if I don't get that guy!
He was lucky.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Are you going to academy
classes?
Your acting was really great.
I was keeping up with you.
You little bastard.
What do you mean calling me,
"you"?
Then what should I call you?
Do you think you're Hong Gil
Dong?
You have a brother, but you 
can't call him your brother?
"Hyeong", what bullshit.
Even a dog passing by would 
laugh.
You used to call me "hyeong".
- When did I? 
- You just did.
No, I never called you that.
You brat.
This little bastard, who are 
you lying to?
I'm an expert on lying, okay?
Let's hurry and get home.
Fine, then you lead the way. 
Hurry.
You can take me home, kid.
- You can't move a single step
without me, kid.
- Let go. Let go!
Let go!
You scared me. Seriously.
Do you want to throw me 
down again?
Here, hold on.
Son of a bitch, it's just "hyeong".
Should I get an MRI or 
something?
A CT scan isn't very expensive.
That's enough.
But did you see it?
That fucking guy was so 
infuriating!
Did you see the woman he was
with?
She was really pretty! 
It's so irritating!
So in other words...
Can you go back to your room?
We have some things to 
discuss, Du Yeong and I.
They even have tea to drink.
They could go into his room
and chat.
It's fine.
Just go ahead and say it.
Du Yeong.
If it's about that, then stop.
I won't do it.
Are you embarrassed? 
A Paralympics medal,
is it meaningless?
I don't want to be seen as a
blind, disabled person.
As a normal person, if I say 
this it may have no meaning.
But some people say,
disabilities aren't to be 
overcome.
They're to be accepted.
How can they be accepted?
Overnight, the whole world left
me and I became a big joke.
I know you are enduring an 
incredible limitation.
But Du Yeong,
there are people who can help
with your limitations.
But if you feel humiliation,
no one can help with that 
but you.
Would you change places
with me?
I have lost everything.
If you had lost everything,
you wouldn't be talking about
"limitations" and such.
That's right, Du Yeong.
- But this matter... 
- The kid says he doesn't
want to!
Whatever it is, he has to do it
willingly.
If you force him, what if he gets
injured?
How much more damage do 
you want to do? Leave.
Don't come back. Just go.
Do you have the right to 
do this?
You never even cared whether
Du Yeong ate or not.
These days, who the hell 
has malnutrition?
I want some barbecued pork.
Is that so?
Coach, you can eat before
you go.
I...
You might as well pick up
some chopsticks before you go.
Well...
Can we drink some somaek, too?
[mix of beer and soju]
Do whatever you want. 
I'm not playing bartender.
I'm from Hancheong Church.
This is domestically made candy.
Ajussi.
Do you have some pork belly?
Yes, we do.
Okay, give me some beef and
some pork belly strips.
Okay.
Today, it looks like chicken
is the best.
Hold on.
Damn you.
Are you a pastor?
Do you want to accept Jesus?
7 to 3 is the golden ratio.
Shouldn't he eat something?
I should.
No, no.
His stomach is full. He doesn't
need to eat to live.
This is a man who will never be 
hungry by the glory and grace 
of God.
Who?
A neighborhood resident.
Don't worry about him.
He's a born barbecue expert.
He's your younger brother?
Are you checking our family 
registry? Grill your meat.
Are you married?
Chew your meat.
Check what family registry?
I'm not married.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
Hey, the atmosphere isn't bad.
There's still a lot of meat. 
I'll make one for you.
I'll fix it for you.
I don't want all that fat.
The lean meat is best. 
Lean meat, okay?
Garlic? One or two?
Two.
Eat this up.
Onion?
A little bit.
Eat a lot.
Here.
Have a drink first.
Here.
Drink this first.
Here.
You can't leave empty-handed.
Thank goodness.
Du Yeong and his brother 
have gotten a lot closer.
Your purpose...
is to butt into other people's 
business?
Du Yeong,
was once a star of hope.
He fell before he could shine.
So I feel so hurt.
That's why I butt in.
I won't be so hard on you again.
Because of you,
Du Yeong was smiling.
Do you really have the heart?
It's my independent will, brat.
You have to learn to do these 
things.
Then you can get a wife, brat.
What crazy woman would
marry me?
Oh?
With your looks, why not?
You must have dated a few girls.
When I was in training, 
how could I?
I was working very hard to 
win a gold medal.
You really wasted your youth.
I really can't take it.
Brat, today you're going to 
pick up a girl.
Are you kidding me?
The simplest thing in this world
is to pick up a girl.
For me, it's the hardest.
Come over here, kid.
Now it's more difficult.
Sit down.
This kid, seriously.
Should I explain to you this
thing about women?
This poor fool.
Shut up.
Wait a second.
About girls...
Yeah.
I'll just use judo to explain.
Judo?
Judo.
There's a cola bottle in front
of you. Feel it.
Feel it.
Hold it firmly. Resolutely.
Hold it tighter.
A little tighter.
That's it.
Push it. Pull it.
See? Push, pull.
With women, it's push and pull.
This is a must.
Push.
And...
Your timing has to be right.
Then, when the time comes...
then immediately...
the takedown.
This is already half of your
victory.
And after the takedown?
After the takedown I told you,
it's just like in judo.
There's also some...
Some charm and skill.
Conquer her.
You want to intoxicate her.
Make her intoxicated.
If she runs away? Catch her.
Catch her and hold onto her.
Finally, a merciless move 
towards victory.
Enough.
You still need some ability.
How can you worry? Just win.
You can move your eyes, right?
With your eyes, look left and
then to the lower left,
about 10 seconds.
What?
Like this?
That's good. Then...
Cross your legs and look to 
the upper right for 3 seconds.
I didn't mean give someone
the side-eye!
Enough!
Like that.
It's just like that.
Hey. It's not kicking out.
Don't kick out.
This way, this way.
That's right!
Rough, tough, like a wild horse.
Maintain that feeling and add 
some touching words.
Some touching words?
"People have two kinds of eyes."
"Their physical eyes and..."
"spiritual eyes."
"Regrettably, I have already 
lost my physical eyes..."
"Regrettably, I have already
lost my physical eyes..."
But isn't that a bit cheesy?
Let me finish.
"However, God..."
"has given me another type
of eyes."
"Spiritual eyes."
Spiritual eyes.
Right. Just that way.
Done!
Some self-confidence,
and clothes make the man.
Spiritual eyes.
My leg is starting to feel numb.
Can't I change positions?
No!
My back hurts.
Just suck it up!
Where do things come easy 
in this world?
I will go fishing for a great girl
and bring her back.
Just stay right here.
Hey!
What?
I...
want a Jeon Ji Hyeon style.
You don't want much. I'll just go
find a goddess or something.
People have two kinds.
People have two kinds of eyes.
Their physical eyes,
and their spiritual eyes.
Are you here alone?
Yes.
I came with a friend.
Oh, I see!
My friend had to force me 
to come here.
Since it's my first time,
I feel a bit awkward.
Do you mind if I talk to you
for a little while?
Okay.
People have two kinds of eyes.
Their physical eyes,
- and their spiritual eyes.
- Spiritual eyes?
You may have already noticed.
Regretfully, I...
have lost my physical eyes.
And so...
I was hesitating for quite awhile.
Omo.
Omo. What should we do?
But,
God...
has blessed me with another
type of eyes.
Spiritual eyes.
Then use your spiritual eyes.
How do I look to you?
Are you Jeon Ji Hyeon?
Omo. You really can see!
People always say I'm a mix of
Jeon Ji Hyeon and Kim Tae Hee.
Don't you think the two of us
get along very well?
- Yes.
- You're so handsome!
Omo. How can you be so 
handsome?
Do you want to kiss me?
Do you? Don't you?
Then, I'm going to kiss you.
What?
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait! Let go, let go. 
Hold on a minute!
Omo, omo! What are you doing? 
What are you doing?
Excuse me, I'm sorry. I was
worried. No, no, no.
He must be drunk already. 
He's my little brother.
- No.
- I'm his brother.
- No.
- I'm his brother.
No, wait. We haven't finished.
No. Let go. Let go.
Why do I have to go?
Go away!
No! Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm a woman. Why?
No, you're not a woman. Go!
You're like a bandage on a dog.
Thank you!
Thanks for nothing.
He just thanked me!
He didn't want to!
Seriously.
Go away!
- I'll see you later! 
- Absolutely not! Go! Hurry!
Don't ever see her. 
Don't look at her.
Brat, I was so...
Couldn't you be patient?
I can't stand it. Give me a 
wet paper towel.
Why?
Why? That thing...
Your lips, your lips...
Your lips look like a clown.
What? Was she alone?
That really scared me. 
Seriously. That face.
Hey, let me see.
How hard did she suck on you?
I told you just to wait there, 
you asshole.
She said she was a mix of Kim 
Tae Hee and Jeon Ji Hyeon.
She did?
Wow. That bitch.
That's how this world is.
It's very scary.
A creature like that dares to 
use a goddess' name.
It's really horrible.
Her body...
seemed pretty nice.
You little brat.
So you had the skills to check 
out her body so quickly.
I guess the student really can
surpass the master.
So what did she look like?
If you knew, you wouldn't be 
able to sleep. Let's just say
it was Jeon Ji Hyeon.
Then I would like some more.
Listen carefully, okay?
Let's say you are dead drunk.
You can't tell if you're on the
street or in your room.
That means...
the sidewalk even looks like 
a ladder.
You can't tell if the electricity
poles are upright or lying down.
That's how being that drunk
feels.
- But...
- But?
But,
even in that condition, the 
moment you saw that woman's 
face,
you're suddenly fucking sober!
Shit.
That's why I say,
Managing Director Go,
next time until Chairman Go 
gives you the okay, just wait.
Hello.
I was told to come in and get 
my test results.
But I didn't come in for any
checkup,
so why would I have any test
results?
May I ask your name, please?
Go Du Sik.
You came in through the 
emergency room last time.
Your CT scan and blood test 
results are ready.
Oh, that's what it must be.
Where should I wait?
You'll help me get in quickly?
Sure.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Mr. Go Du Sik.
Just a moment.
This is very difficult for you to
accept so suddenly.
I understand.
- It will be very...
- Just hold on a moment.
= The number you have called
is currently unavailable.=
Say something that people can
understand!
Can't you figure something out?
Customer,
there's nothing we can do 
because of Professor Kim's
surgery schedule.
I mean, that quack just told me
I'll kick off in 3 months.
But I have to wait a few months
until I can see the best doctor.
This is a bullshit situation.
This is a bullshit situation.
Can't an educated person even
add and subtract?
Customer, the hospital system...
I get it! It's the system!
Register now and wait months
to get treatment, that system.
I know about the damn system!
But tell me, don't you have a
responsibility?
If I wait and wait until I die, 
don't you have...
What are you looking at?
Shit.
- Customer, I'm sorry, but you 
can't act like this. 
- Let go. Let go.
Instead of that nonsense, give
me a solution! A solution!
Please calm down.
What's a solution?
He said I have fucking late
stage pancreatic cancer!
I'm just supposed to wait until
I die?
Until I die?... 
Let me go, you fucker!
What?
What should I do? 
Figure something out!
Answer me!
Some fucking university hospital!
It's worse than a fucking 
private hospital!
Do I look like I don't have 
money?
Fuck off.
I have money.
I'll give you money!
I'll give you money!
I'll give you money. Just give
me a fucking appointment!
What are you looking at?
Body waste builds up, what 
does that mean?
Better to die cleanly?
Why isn't he answering his
phone?
What's that sound?
What if you get injured?
You could get burned...
Let me see.
You did get burned, damn it.
Where is the medicine?
Does a beggar live in your
stomach?
If you're hungry, just tell me 
and I'll make it for you!
I wanted to cook for you.
What is this shit?
Mom would always fry an egg.
That's how you liked it.
This is a real variety show.
The persimmon tree in the
courtyard,
grew up eating fried eggs.
After waiting for you all day,
when it was cold, she'd bury it 
under the tree.
She'd say, "Eat this and grow
delicious persimmons for my 
Du Sik to eat."
She'd say, "Eat this and grow
delicious persimmons for my
Du Sik to eat."
That's how it was.
That's fucking enough.
Are you trying to make me
feel bad?
Did you think I'd believe that?
Stay put. I'll go and buy 
some medicine.
What the hell?
Can you walk?
Yes.
I'll get you some clothes.
Where are we going?
You said you wanted to see
your mom.
Mom.
Dad.
We came together.
You don't need to worry anymore.
I'm going to the restroom. 
Wait here.
Hey...
Hurry back.
One of your two sons became
blind.
Father's son from his second
marriage.
As for me...
I'm going to die soon.
All of our previous resentment,
we can settle it soon when we
all meet.
But that kid...
Du Yeong...
What should I do?
Don't just smile at me like 
that and tell me.
Drink this slowly.
Here.
It's good, right?
It's good.
You...
used to be pretty good at judo,
I hear.
I heard you were a gold medal
contender.
If you've got great skills like
that, it's a shame to waste it.
If you've got great skills like
that, it's a shame to waste it.
Then,
you didn't get a chance.
Where is... What's it called?
The Paralympics?
If you participated in that, 
you could find out, right?
What are you trying to say?
Start again. Judo.
You wanted to tell me that?
Yeah.
I don't want to.
Why?
Are you afraid people will say
you're trying too hard?
I can't even go to the 
supermarket.
I can't even buy a package of
ramen by myself!
How can someone like that
represent their country?
I'm saying I'll help you.
I will help you.
Your coach will, and other 
people will too.
We'll help you and will never
abandon you.
Let's go.
Are you crazy?
How can I run?
Don't you know this place?
When we were young, we 
played all day long here.
It's not the same as it used to be.
It's the same.
It hasn't changed a bit.
I used to be by your side and
I'm still by your side, right?
I don't want to.
Let's go home.
How long are you going to 
stay stuck in that house?
How does someone who spent 
their life as an athlete just 
give it up?
I might as well die.
Ah, fuck that! Seriously.
Die?
Is dying so trivial?
We're all going to die, but if it
were me, I'd at least run before
I fucking die!
We're all going to die, but if it
were me, I'd at least run before
I fucking die!
What won't you do if you're
about to die?
I'm scared.
I will watch out for you, okay?
Try running and see.
Du Yeong.
Start running, Go Du Yeong!
Trust me and run, you brat!
Run!
Very good!
Very good, Go Du Yeong!
Very good.
Are you all right?
Well done.
Well done.
- Will you help me?
- I'll help you.
If people laugh at me,
will you help me teach them 
a lesson?
I'll throttle them, those fucking
sons of bitches.
What's going on that you 
ran over here?
Did you put on makeup?
Well, just a little.
Some BB cream isn't enough.
It's too bad.
Let's turn Go Du Yeong into a 
national athlete.
National athlete?
Du Yeong wants to?
It wasn't easy to convince him.
We need to train him quickly
before he changes his mind.
What happened suddenly?
Why are you curious?
You're so nosy.
By the way,
well...
if the athlete wins a gold medal, 
do they get some kind of a pension?
They won't cut it in half because
they're disabled or something?
It's all the same. They get a
pension and a bonus.
Why?
Are you going to take it away?
I have one condition.
You have to always be on 
his side.
I think you may not understand
this,
but I am a team coach.
The team also has other 
mentors and coaches.
Then you're a swindler.
What does that mean?
I need to know he's not alone 
and will have people to help him.
You can just act as his manager.
For training and competition, 
just follow him around.
We have a history.
After Du Yeong was born, 
I really liked him.
But as he grew up, I started to
really hate him.
He didn't do anything wrong.
Probably, Go Du Yeong feels
it was unfair.
Since we just met again, I
want to take care of him.
But it seems I have cancer.
I'm going to die.
So I'm saying Go Du Yeong will
be alone and I need you to help him.
If you don't help him,
Du Yeong won't become a 
national athlete.
There's no one except you.
I only put 300 km on it.
Please handle it for me.
But why do you want to sell
this car already?
No reason.
What? What did you say?
Where are you going?
To be a Paralympic athlete
coach.
Why would you do that?
Hey, Lee Su Hyeon.
Have you been drinking?
I want to take Go Du Yeong.
Du Yeong wants to continue
training?
Yes.
Then leave Du Yeong alone.
I'll make a call and find someone
to take good care of him.
If he doesn't train with me, 
he won't let him go.
Who? Who won't let him? Who?
His older brother.
I'll come back after Du Yeong 
has settled in.
What if you come back?
Who guarantees your position
will be available?
In that case,
I'll just keep working with the 
disabled team until I die.
You're really unbelievable!
Hey, kid!
You've worked so hard until now!
You're telling me you want to
undo all that?
If I leave Du Yeong all alone,
I'll be distracted and always
worried about him.
Do you think it's easy for me?
Go Du Yeong isn't your brother!
Why are you worried for him?
I have to prove it to him!
Even if he has lost everything,
even if everything in front of
him is dark,
he can live his life with a smile.
It also drives me crazy that it's 
come to this point.
But,
if I'm going to take Du Yeong's
hand,
I have to drop the hand I'm 
holding.
Only then can I take his hand.
You should help me.
Hey, Tae Won Seong, kid!
If you keep goofing off, just 
see what I do!
Are you paying attention?
This kid, do you want to die?
Go Du Yeong's eyes have arrived.
What is this?
What else? Your eyes.
This goes in your hand.
I don't want it.
Instead of not moving because
you can't see, use this.
You can step boldly forward! 
That's a lot better.
You just flick this open.
Hold it like this...
It's a little noisy, noisy.
Am I feeling it?
Seriously.
Of all the blind people in this
world, you're the best.
What bullshit is that?
-=2016 Paralympic Qualifying=-
Get ready!
Begin!
Yuko, white!
Score!
Yuko? Yuko?
Hey, Go Du Yeong!
Are you afraid of hurting your
opponent?
Get ready!
Begin!
Ippon!
Ippon scored! Winner!
Competition ended!
But,
is the car broken?
The car?
I sold it.
Why?
Are you tired of taking the bus
and the subway?
No, that's not it.
You're an athlete.
You must be tough in the face
of hardships.
If you keep eating only ramen
noodles, you'll surely win the 
gold medal.
- When it was 19...
- I'm going.
Even when his brother is talking.
Thank you.
Do well. Stay strong.
Fortunately,
since none of you can see,
you won't be too stunned by 
my beauty to practice.
In any case, no matter what 
anyone says,
all of you are Korean national
athletes.
So please do your best.
$4.50
What?
You even deliver black bean
noodles,
Mr. Pastor?
Don't order just one bowl at
peak time.
Shouldn't that be an unwritten
rule?
This is crazy.
Seriously.
The church,
is also a business.
You can't get in without a 
college education.
Those large churches,
their annual salary is higher
than Samsung.
That's why you majored in
theology?
At least I could graduate with
a theology degree,
so I took the theological 
college exam.
A pastor. Aigoo.
You became a pastor.
It's so wrong. How can I even 
die in peace?
Anyway, I dropped out of
school.
You don't need to feel wronged.
You can just die whenever it's
your time.
Yes?
Bastard, why haven't you 
come back from your delivery?
What?
If this is how you're going 
to be, then just quit.
Okay.
You're not leaving yet?
Come on.
You delivered a meal to my 
home and then you ate it.
Do you have any beer?
Why?
They told me not to come back
to work.
Really?
Du Yeong.
That friend is...
really a kid with potential.
A national athlete.
Dig it deeper. If there's a 
hurricane, it will fall over.
You said you'd pay me daily.
If you don't pay me, I can call
the Ministry of Labor.
Why are you laughing?
Afterward, you need to bury
a fried egg.
You know,
there are some good fertilizers.
Why use a fried egg?
Even I can't eat a fried egg.
How is it?
It seems almost the same.
Come over and look.
What?
Hey!
Hey, hey!
What happened?
I need 112.
Please send an ambulance
here quickly!
What?
It's a waste of time.
Yes, hyeong-nim.
That's 119, right?
119, yeah.
Hang up.
It's useless.
You won't be home for a couple
of months.
I know.
All of the difficult work you've
been doing
will pay off when we get to 
Brazil.
Yes, Coach.
This doesn't seem like our 
house.
What did you do to this house?
-=Home of Go Du Yeong=-
Just let the feelings come.
Just let the feelings come.
Of the women in South America,
Brazil is great.
After the competition is over,
I'm going to seduce a Brazilian
lady before I come back.
Look at this kid.
I belong to the global class.
The moment I appear,
they all start shouting about 
changing their nationality.
But I can't speak English.
That's why you're an amateur, kid.
Do you only need your mouth 
to seduce a woman?
It takes a feeling.
You need a certain expression,
kid.
A feeling.
I hope I win the gold medal
this time.
I should do well, right?
Of course you will.
That gold medal already belongs
to Go Du Yeong.
Who can win that gold medal
besides you?
It's all taken care of, almost.
Oh yeah, there's something.
I... got a job.
I... got a job.
A job?
I'm not unemployed anymore.
I have a friend in Busan.
He's going to be erecting a 
large building and he asked me
to come.
When?
I guess...
right away.
He keeps bugging me to come
at once.
Should I drop it and go to 
Brazil with you?
You dropped out of high school,
so it's not easy to find work.
You little son of a bitch.
Do you have to dig at someone's
sore spot?
If you go down there and do
really well,
you'll get hired permanently?
That's right.
Right. It's good if you have a 
job, then you can get married.
Take care of yourself first. You.
Kid, you're worried about
nothing.
Then I should go to Brazil by
myself this time.
With the coach.
Will you be okay?
I've gotten pretty good with
using my cane.
As for the competition,
I'm going to win.
This kid.
You're a pretty cocky guy.
If you go there and don't win
the gold medal,
just stay there in Brazil and
don't come back, you brat.
You must dance the samba.
You have to dance.
Samba.
How's this?
Not too bad!
You dance pretty well, Go Du Yeong.
It's like this. Go like this.
Move to the beat.
Don't run around all over.
Listen to that self-proclaimed
beautiful coach.
I didn't call myself that, okay?
Other people call me that.
Please notice the mood here.
We're trying to film the long
farewell scene, seriously.
Be sure to work very hard.
When I come back, I'll go
to Busan.
Fine.
We'll go eat some sashimi later.
Remember to eat properly.
- Things that are easy to digest... 
- Hurry, hurry. Let's go.
You can't be late for your plane.
Yes, your brother is right.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I'm going.
Okay, have a pleasant trip.
Republic of Korea athlete, 
Go Du Yeong.
It's the quarter finals!
You're doing great.
That throw-down was clean
and sharp.
I'm sexy, right?
Because of your brother, you've
been corrupted.
I should call him.
Sure. Let's show off to him.
I got into the quarter finals, 
did you see?
Of course I saw it.
That super-photogenic, Go Du 
Yeong.
You're in Busan?
Can't you hear it?
The seagulls are noisy.
You can hear the samba music,
right?
=It's really no joke!=
=They dance right in front of you.=
=The women have great bodies.=
I'm not kidding.
You're just bragging now.
You're always bragging, kid.
It's your bedtime, isn't it?
Shouldn't you sleep?
=I'm fine.=
You have to go to work, right?
Is the food good there?
Yeah.
=The food is good, but your
cooking is the best.=
=Shin Ramyeon. Nagasaki...=
- Just a second.
=Are you doing a good job?=
=You can't be goofing off.=
=I told you to work hard so 
you can get married.=
=This time you really can 
get married.=
Faker.
[fake pastor]
What?
Why are you giving me such
a scary look?
How much is the hourly rate to
deliver black bean noodles?
Why?
I'll pay you more.
Nursing fee.
Am I crazy?
That I'd be your nurse?
I'm very busy.
You're a faker, so how fucking
busy can you be?
I'm tired of being called a faker,
so I want to do better.
I'm going back to school.
You're going to become a 
preacher?
None of your business.
When?
I will.
I won't stop you.
When?
Before that...
help clean up my poop and urine.
After I'm sent away, then you 
can go.
That's so gross. Why would
you say that?
Never mind.
That's all then.
I have to get up early to watch
Du Yeong. Set the alarm clock.
Help me lie down.
I said go lower.
Ah, I got it.
I'm a machine idiot.
Du Yeong.
What is it?
Don't you feel well?
I keep thinking about...
my accident.
That competition.
You've done well until now.
You can't dwell on that.
Coach.
I do want to win the 
gold medal...
I do want to win the
gold medal...
but I'm scared.
I can't breathe.
If I forfeit on the grounds 
of an injury...
Du Yeong.
If you want to forfeit the 
match, then do so. 
Don't force yourself.
You're still young.
You have very good ability.
Next time, you might win it all.
But,
when that time comes...
your brother...
won't be around.
Du Yeong!
I have to go.
I want to go back.
Du Yeong!
I don't want to! I have to go!
Du Yeong, calm down.
Your brother didn't want you to
know, because he was afraid
you'd do this!
Do you think running back to
him right now is the right thing?
Is that it?
If it is, then go.
We'll go back to Korea together.
How much time is left?
Until the match?
About 5 minutes.
I want to be alone.
Oh, Brother.
It's me.
The women here are no joke.
Damn. If I had known, I would 
have gone with you.
Don't worry.
I even got the phone number
from a samba dancer.
Did you pick someone good
this time?
You won't be taken advantage
of again?
This kid never lets me relax.
Are you kidding?
This time it's the truth.
=It's true?=
=Aigoo. I should have gone.=
The final round...
Yes, it's the final round, Kid.
Keep this in mind, you bastard.
If you don't win the gold medal, 
stay there and don't come back.
Stay in Brazil.
If you dare come back, I'll go
to airport
and prohibit you from entering
the country, kid.
The life isn't bad here.
But,
I'm still going to bring a gold
medal back to South Korea.
For sure.
I will bring back a gold medal.
=Just wait.=
=Okay?=
You have to wait.
Du Yeong.
Yes.
I miss you.
=I really miss you, so come
back quickly.=
Is it very painful?
=I said, is it very painful?=
Come back soon.
I'm about to die, so hurry,
you bastard.
It hurts even more when you're
not around.
Hurry back.
Don't be in pain.
I'll be back soon.
You can do it, Go Du Yeong.
The 2016 Rio Paralympic Games.
The finals of the Judo 60 kg 
class are about to begin.
This is the debut of a Republic 
of Korea athlete in the finals.
We are broadcasting live for
everyone.
Compared to ordinary Olympians,
these two athletes have had to
work harder and with greater
hardships.
In their minds right now,
they must be thinking of that
hard work they have put in.
Athlete Go Du Yeong looks 
very nervous.
Get ready!
Begin!
The match has begun.
This is a match worthy of the
finals with aggressive attacks.
It's a battle of nerves with 
these 2 athletes.
There was no trip.
Five technical attacks have not 
succeeded.
Violation!
Although dangerous, it was 
fortunately out of bounds.
Unfortunately, that ippon seoi
nage was out of bounds.
Du Yeong, get lower. 
Grab tighter with your left arm!
Get ready!
The 2 athletes are at the center 
of the ring.
Begin!
Waza-ari!
[half point]
Unfortunately, that score was
taken away.
Waza-ari!
Out! Hold it!
Du Yeong, steady yourself. 
Are you alright?
There's still time. It's okay.
Then, Go Du Yeong has lost
half a point.
Give me a cigarette, quickly.
I don't have any.
It's fine.
I quit.
Really.
How did you quit so fast?
Watch the match. The match.
Against the Turkish athlete,
Go Du Yeong still has hope.
He's not afraid. 
He has risen through this entire
competition the same way.
A more cautious and calm
response to this competition.
With assistance of the referee, 
the 2 athletes move to the 
center of the ring.
They have gripped each other's
uniform. 
Republic of Korea athlete, 
Go Du Yeong.
Grip him firmly, kid.
Tightly.
Hey, Go Du Yeong!
Are you afraid of hurting your
opponent?
Do you think you're Hong Gil 
Dong?
You have a brother, but you
can't call him your brother?
That's how a jerk who ran away
from home was able to live.
You have to start buttons
from the neck, kid.
Are you feeling sick?
Who's sick?
Where would I feel 
uncomfortable?
Du Yeong.
Start running!
Trust me and run, you brat!
Do you have an older brother?
I have one.
Begin!
A great tomoe nage!
A high technical score for 
Go Du Yeong!
Hold him! Hold him!
His opponent is struggling to 
break free, but cannot escape!
Don't let go, Du Yeong. 
Du Yeong.
Go Du Yeong is still holding on. 
Press and hold! Press and hold!
Please.
Waza-ari!
And so...
a victory!
Athlete Go Du Yeong has won
the gold medal!
Athlete Go Du Yeong!
Go Du Yeong well deserves
all of this applause.
He originally was to compete 
at the Rio Olympic Games,
with high expectations of 
winning a medal.
Now he has won gold at the Rio
Paralympic Games. It's almost
unbelievable! 
Although he experienced pain, 
he was able to bounce back.
For continuing his athletic career,
Go Du Yeong really deserves our
warm applause.
What's wrong with him?
Is he in shock?
Hyeong.
Hyeong!
Hyeong!
Hyeong!
He's insane.
Hyeong!
Hyeong!
Hyeong!
Juice.
Grape juice.
It tastes like orange juice.

phone,
that's my number.
I'm available 24 hours a day.

Also,
your brother wanted me to 
give this to you.
your brother wanted me to
give this to you.
=My dearest little brother, 
Du Yeong.=
=In this unreal world, I hope 
you become a bridge.=
=One that's so beautiful...=
=No. What the heck? Aigoo.
Fuck.=
=Well anyway,=

Du Yeong.=

=A man needs the right 
clothes, okay?=
=Don't just fiddle around, but
go out dressed properly.=
=And don't ask if they're Jeon 
Ji Hyeon and get fooled again.=
=You worry me to death.=
=I, your brother...=
=have to say some things 
to you.=
=And that is,=
=you are absolutely not alone.=
=Your father, mom, and=
=me, your brother, will always
be by your side, don't forget.=
=And what else?=
=Oh right, that.=
=On behalf of our family, enjoy 
yourself and then come over.=
=Okay? Have fun, you bastard.=
=If your life is meaningless,=
=I will be very sad.=
=And last of all,=
=we will certainly see you 
again someday.=
=I'll really miss you, 
little brother.=
Hyeong.
Oh, you're quite handsome.
Oh, you're quite handsome.
You're a pretty arrogant guy.
You're a pretty cocky guy.
