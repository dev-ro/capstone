So,
ÿÿÿÿwe all settled? We all good?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿPull it up one more time.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, so...
Tell me that story.
ÿÿOkay.
ÿÿÿÿBefore I was born...
when I was in the tummy
of my mother...
ÿÿmy father would always
ÿÿsay atappa,
ÿÿa Pashtun story.
ÿÿÿÿIf you look
ÿÿÿÿat the world map...
on the east side, you can find
a country called Afghanistan.
Long ago, it had a fight
with another country
called England.
ÿÿThe Afghan people,
ÿÿthey were losing hope.
And a teenager
saw the fighters running away.
ÿÿÿÿShe goes up to the mountain.
ÿÿShe raised her voice.
ÿÿWhich simply means...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿit is better to live
ÿÿÿÿÿÿlike a lion for one day...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthan to live like a slave
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor a hundred years.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe encouraged the people
ÿÿÿÿÿÿof Afghanistan.
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿShe led the army
ÿÿÿÿto a great victory.
ÿÿÿÿBut she was shot...
ÿÿÿÿand she died
ÿÿÿÿon that battlefield.
ÿÿHer name was Malalai.
ÿÿÿÿWhen I was in coma,
ÿÿÿÿI had these terrible dreams.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿAnd I was thinking
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthat I was dead.
ÿÿÿÿLying near death...
ÿÿA 15-year-old was shot
for standing up
to the Taliban.
Tonight, Malala
ÿÿremains in intensive care.
She was shot
ÿÿin the head by the Taliban...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor daring to suggest
ÿÿÿÿÿÿgirls should go to school.
Now millions
ÿÿÿÿÿÿaround the world
ÿÿare watching to see...
if she will die for her cause.
When I opened
ÿÿmy eyes...
ÿÿÿÿI did not know where I was.
ÿÿÿÿI realized
ÿÿÿÿthat this is not my country.
ÿÿÿÿAnd I thought, "No one knows
ÿÿÿÿwhat's my name."
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI saw nurses and doctors.
When she first woke up,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿher first question was...
ÿÿÿÿ"Where's my father?"
We were thinking,
"What Malala
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwill be thinking?"
ÿÿÿÿ"I was a child.
ÿÿÿÿYou should have stopped me.
"What has happened to me
is because of you."
It is an honor for me
ÿÿto be speaking again...
Come, Malala, come!
ÿÿWhat is the problem?
I lost my shoes.
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿIt's okay.
Atal Khan Yousafzai,
ÿÿÿÿI'm waiting for you
ÿÿÿÿto take breakfast.
This is
ÿÿmy youngest brother.
ÿÿHe's a really good boy.
ÿÿHe has a lot of energy.
He would demand us that,
ÿÿ"I want to play golf,
ÿÿand I want to"...
This is the laziest one.
ÿÿYou see?
ÿÿLook at the first impression!
ÿÿOne, two, three. Start.
His name is
ÿÿKhushal Khan Yousafzai, and...
ÿÿand he's a okay boy.
ÿÿWait, wait, wait!
ÿÿÿÿÿÿYou don't get
to ÿÿÿÿÿÿuse two hands.
- .- ÿÿÿÿThis is Malala Yousafzai
ÿÿÿÿShe's the naughtiest gir
l ÿÿÿÿon the earth.
ÿÿOne, two, three, go.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt's not fair.
ÿÿCome on, then.
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿNo!
People think
that she is really kind
ÿÿand she speaks
ÿÿfor people's rights...
e.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut that's not tru
In home, she is so violent.
I'm not violent!
.ÿÿÿÿI would request my brother..
ÿÿÿÿÿÿnot to say any bad thi
ng ÿÿÿÿÿÿabout me.
.ÿÿÿÿHe should only praise me
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI play with them,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI fight with them.
ÿÿI get a little bit naughty,
ÿÿbut that's fine.
That's my right.
She's a little bit naughty.
That much.
What does she do?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe just slaps me every ti
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwhen I meet her.
l.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhen I come from schoo
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhen my brother's fighting
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwith me,
you come and rescue me.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhen I go to your room,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿyou slap me there as well!
That's
ÿÿkind of confusing.
ÿÿSave me from one
ÿÿand hit me in the other one.
ÿÿHe's saying I beat Khushal
ÿÿand then I protect Atal...
ÿÿÿÿbut when I take him
ÿÿÿÿto my room,
ÿÿthen I myself give him a slap.

ÿÿÿÿ(MIMICS SLAPPING

It's out of love.
It's just for love.

ÿÿÿÿIt is not a love
ÿÿÿÿIt is a sign of love

ÿÿhow much I love you and...

ÿÿÿÿ...how sweet and cut
e ÿÿÿÿyou are for me.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThat's why I give you a sl

When you laugh,
do you get any pain
down here?
.No.
ÿÿÿÿOkay
ÿÿThis place is tight. This one.
These ones.
ÿÿSay "special".
Special.
Now say "feel."
ÿÿÿÿÿÿFeel.
ÿÿÿÿ"Freddy.
"
ÿÿÿÿFreddy.

ÿÿÿÿNo pain when
ÿÿÿÿyou stretch it like that
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMmm-
There it feels
a little bit tight.
ÿÿÿÿThe nerve doesn't seem t
o ÿÿÿÿstimulate this muscle?
ÿÿÿÿThat's unlikely to come back
ÿÿÿÿThe damage was too severe.
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿIt's okay. Look there.
When I was in Pakistan,
it was a different world
for me.
Here, I have just spent
one year only.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI don't really understand
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthis new society
ÿÿÿÿand these new rules.
Dear!
ÿÿÿÿIt's a dog!
S)
(LAUGH
Sorry, Malala.
You all right?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt's fine.
ÿÿÿÿI want people to learn
ÿÿÿÿfrom the experience I had...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand the story of my life.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey want you alon
e, ÿÿÿÿÿÿso look there,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand then there.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿSo, the name of the sh
ÿÿÿÿÿÿis The Daily Show?
ÿÿÿÿVery nice to see you
.
Nice to see you.
ÿÿ
Okay, straight.
The Queen of England
has invited you to the Palace.
ÿÿ
With
ÿÿall these public appearances,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿdo you have any semblance
ÿÿÿÿÿÿof a normal life?
ÿÿTake a deep breath.
ÿÿJust relax your hands.
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿ
ÿÿLook to this side.
No, you're good. Thank you.
You're very good.
ÿÿWhich camera now?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWell...
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿI'm done.
ÿÿWe couldn't go to market,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwe were not allowe
d ÿÿÿÿÿÿto go to school.
,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿAnd that's why I spoke
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbecause I believe
ÿÿÿÿÿÿin equality...
e
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand I believe
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthat there is no differenc
between a man and a woman.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI even believe that a woma
ÿÿÿÿÿÿis more powerful than men.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhat? Wait

ÿÿÿÿ
You should teach m

to write something with it?
ÿÿNo, it's okay.

When she was very small,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿmany friends used to come
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto our home.
We used to talk
about politics,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwe used to talk
ÿÿÿÿÿÿabout the basic rights...
ÿÿÿÿand she used to sit with us.
When I was young,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI used to listen to him.
Like, what is he saying,
how he talks.
We became dependent
ÿÿon each other.
Like one soul
in two different bodies.
ÿÿÿÿWho would you have
ÿÿÿÿbeen if you were jus
t ÿÿÿÿan ordinary girl
?
ÿÿÿÿfrom the Swat Valley
ÿÿIf I was an ordinary girl
ÿÿin Swat Valley...
ÿÿI'm still an ordinary girl.
ÿÿBut if I had
ÿÿan ordinary father
ÿÿand an ordinary mother...
ÿÿand a conservative family...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthen I would have
ÿÿÿÿÿÿtwo children now.
So this would have been
my future.
ÿÿÿÿYou would have seen Malala
ÿÿÿÿsitting with her two babies.
You named her
ÿÿafter a girl who spoke out...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand was killed
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor speaking out.
ÿÿIt's almost as if you said...
ÿÿ"She will be separate
ÿÿfrom the world,
ÿÿÿÿ"she will be
ÿÿÿÿan activist abroad.
"She'll be different from
ÿÿÿÿÿÿall the other women
"in Swat and Pakistan."
ÿÿÿÿÿÿYou are right.
It was very early
ÿÿÿÿin the morning...
ÿÿÿÿwhen the night goes,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand the morning
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand the day comes.
ÿÿÿÿA girl, whose mother
ÿÿÿÿwas helping my wife
ÿÿin the delivery of the child,
ÿÿcame to me.
ÿÿÿÿShe told me,
"A child has come
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto your home."
ÿÿÿÿIt was a kind of attachment
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfrom the very first moment
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI saw her.
ÿÿÿÿA few days after, my cousin
ÿÿÿÿbrought the family tree.
ÿÿIt traced back for 300 years.
No woman was mentioned.
Only men were there.
I took the pen, draw a line...
ÿÿÿÿand wrote "Malala."
ÿÿ
Malala,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthank you for joining us.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThank you so much.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThe Taliban have said that
ÿÿÿÿÿÿif you return to Pakistan,
ÿÿÿÿthey will kill you.
ÿÿÿÿHow do you feel
ÿÿÿÿabout such threats?
ÿÿÿÿOn the one-year anniversary
ÿÿof Malala's attack...
ÿÿÿÿthe Taliban said
ÿÿÿÿthey would target her again.
ÿÿMalala has often said
ÿÿÿÿshe wants to return
ÿÿÿÿto Pakistan...
in spite of the death threats.
The bullet
hit Malala's forehead...
ÿÿshattering her skull inwards.
ÿÿÿÿFragments of bone
ÿÿÿÿwere driven into her brain.
The bullet
ÿÿÿÿÿÿdestroyed both her eardrum
ÿÿand the tiny bones
ÿÿwithin the middle ear.
My father said,
"Have you forgiven them?"
All this time,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿyou've never felt angry?
ÿÿÿÿNo.
ÿÿNot even as small as an atom,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿor maybe a nucleus
ÿÿÿÿÿÿof an atom...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿor maybe a proton,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿor maybe a quark.
Never angry?
ÿÿNever.
ÿÿÿÿIslam teaches us humanity...
ÿÿequality, forgiveness.
It doesn't matter for me
if my left side
ÿÿÿÿof my face isn't working...
ÿÿÿÿor if I cannot blink
ÿÿÿÿthis eye properly.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt doesn't matter for me
ÿÿÿÿÿÿif I can't smile properly.
ÿÿÿÿIt doesn't matter that
ÿÿÿÿI'm not hearing in this ear.
ÿÿI can't hear.
When the Taliban came to Swat,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿeveryone thought
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthat they are good people.
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿMullah was very charming...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿvery popular in the area.
He was the talk of the town.
Everybody used to discuss him.
ÿÿ
He was called
ÿÿ"Radio Mullah"...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand he would give sermons
ÿÿÿÿÿÿon the radio every day.
His sermons could be
heard by everyone in the town.
The most popular part of
his show came every evening...
ÿÿwhen he would read out
ÿÿpeople's names.
People liked to hear which
of their neighbors was sinful.
ÿÿ
We lived
only 100 miles
from our capital, Islamabad...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut we were separated
ÿÿÿÿÿÿby a great mountain pass.
And for a time,
our isolation meant
we lived in a paradise.
Life was normal,
life was happy.
I was able to go
to the streets
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand play with my friends.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿPlay hide-and-seek
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand running games.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI miss the dirty streets.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI miss the river.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI miss my friends.
ÿÿIn this new school,
ÿÿit's quite difficult.
ÿÿTo be really honest...
ÿÿÿÿI don't feel comfortable
ÿÿÿÿwhen people can see my legs.
So my skirt is longer
than most of the girls'.
ÿÿAnd then, my life is quite
ÿÿdifferent than their life.
ÿÿMost of them have boyfriends.
Most of them have broke up
with some of the boyfriends
and found new ones.
ÿÿIt's quite difficult
ÿÿto tell girls who really I am.
ÿÿÿÿI don't know whether
ÿÿÿÿthey would like me,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿor whether
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthey're interested in me.
ÿÿÿÿ
In Kenya, there are so many
girls who cannot go to school.
ÿÿÿÿ
Grade nine?
ÿÿUp to which grade?
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿI lived in this country.
ÿÿI was born in this country
ÿÿcalled Pakistan...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI was born in Swat Valley.
ÿÿÿÿThere are more than
ÿÿÿÿ180 million people.
ÿÿMost of them are youth.
ÿÿSo, who wants to
ÿÿbecome a doctor?
ÿÿYou want to.
The number one is wheat.
Number two is rice.
ÿÿNumber three is maize.
ÿÿÿÿWho wants to study history?
ÿÿThat's great.
ÿÿIt's called K2.
ÿÿIt comes through these valleys
ÿÿand goes down, down, down,
ÿÿand through Sindh.
ÿÿWhat do you want to be?
ÿÿOn this side?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿYeah.
ÿÿThe girls whose mother
ÿÿor father is educated,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthey should raise
up ÿÿÿÿÿÿtheir hands.
I loved education.
ÿÿÿÿI loved to be a teacher.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI started my own school...
just with $150.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWe hired a small building.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI was the sweeper.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI was the manager.
ÿÿI was the headmaster.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThe very first day
ÿÿÿÿÿÿof my school,
ÿÿI stood and I recited
ÿÿthe national anthem.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThere were three students,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand it started.
I used to be
ÿÿin school all the day.
ÿÿI loved the way
ÿÿteacher was speaking.
ÿÿÿÿAnd I loved the way
ÿÿÿÿthe students
were listening carefully
to the teacher...
being all around with
other girls and with teachers.
ÿÿÿÿI put in my student
ÿÿÿÿa kind of rebel
against traditions, customs...
ÿÿand how to raise their voice.
I could not
ÿÿÿÿeven speak properly, but...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿin my own language
ÿÿÿÿI would try to give lectures
ÿÿÿÿto the empty classrooms.
ÿÿÿÿSchool was my home.
ÿÿMoniba was here and then
ÿÿI was sitting next to her.
ÿÿHere was I.
ÿÿAnd here was Shazia,
ÿÿand here was Kainat.
ÿÿThe Talib came here...
ÿÿand I was just
ÿÿvery near to him...
ÿÿand then he asked,
ÿÿ"Who is Malala?"
e.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThis is an easy on
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿOkay, choose a card
ÿÿÿÿin all these cards
.ÿÿÿÿand then remember it
ÿÿNow see my tricks.
ÿÿThis is your card.
ÿÿ
ÿÿ How do you do this?
The next two bullets
ÿÿhit Shazia and Kainat.
ÿÿWhere did the bullet hit you?
ÿÿThis right arm. Here.
This is the inside,
and this was outside.
ÿÿTwo bullets hit Shazia.
- r.
- And was my shoulde
The bullet
ÿÿthat hit her
ÿÿin her left shoulder
ÿÿhit Kainat.
ÿÿSo one bullet
ÿÿhit two of them...
ÿÿÿÿand one bullet went through
ÿÿÿÿthe hand of Shazia.
ÿÿÿÿ
Mullah Fazlullah
ÿÿÿÿÿÿmight be
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe first person
ÿÿÿÿÿÿin our history...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto talk directly
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto women in Swat.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿHe was a Pashto speaker...
and he talked to people
in their own language.
Sometimes
ÿÿÿÿÿÿhe would say,
"Men, go outside now.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI'm talking to the women."
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿ
He took them
ÿÿinto confidence.
ÿÿHe used to talk to women
ÿÿabout their issues directly.
ÿÿÿÿ
You see,
ÿÿÿÿour women are illiterate...
ÿÿÿÿignorant from all other kind
ÿÿÿÿof information.
ÿÿWhen all other windows
ÿÿare closed...
ÿÿand the only window
ÿÿthat is open to their mind
ÿÿthat is Fazlullah's window...
ÿÿultimately that man
ÿÿwill have an effect on them.
Like many women
from Swat,
my mother used to cover
her face.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿNot for religion,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut for tradition.
ÿÿÿÿNow in the U.K.,
ÿÿÿÿshe does not cover her face.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe only covers her hair.
Sometimes she says,
ÿÿÿÿ"Don't shake hand with men.
"Look down. Don't look at men.
It's a shame."
And I said,
"If men can look at me,
ÿÿÿÿ"why can't I look at them?"
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe told me many times...
"Cover your face because
"people would think
ÿÿÿÿÿÿyou are not a nice girl."
ÿÿ
But covering my face
ÿÿÿÿwas something that...
made me feel like I was just
hiding my identity, who I was.
ÿÿ
I think she's not
ÿÿÿÿÿÿindependent or free...
ÿÿÿÿbecause she's not educated.
What are
ÿÿthose yellow Post-its?
I want to
ÿÿÿÿÿÿincrease my vocabulary...
because now I'm living
in an English society...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand I want to have
ÿÿÿÿÿÿgood vocabulary.
ÿÿÿÿI see "cat burglar."
Why do you care about
the word "cat burglar"?
Because
ÿÿÿÿI know what's a cat,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut I didn't know
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwhat's a burglar.
ÿÿÿÿSo I have written...
a thief
who enters a building...
"by climbing to
ÿÿÿÿÿÿan upper story."
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿSchool is quite complicated.
ÿÿIt's really hard to find way.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿSo there are blue stairs,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿred stairs, green stairs.
ÿÿIt's good
ÿÿthat they colored it,
ÿÿÿÿotherwise I would have been
ÿÿÿÿlost in my school.
She does all
ÿÿÿÿof her homework all the day.
ÿÿFrom 5:00 until 11:00 or 1:00,
ÿÿshe does all her homework.
Why?
I don't know.
ÿÿI award you
ÿÿthe honorary degree
ÿÿof Master of Arts.
w.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI think she's addicted
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto books. That's all I kno
ÿÿÿÿ
It's a terrible problem.
.ÿÿÿÿÿÿYeah. ÿÿÿÿÿÿNo, not really
ÿÿ
In Swat,
ÿÿI was considered to be
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe top girl in the class.
ÿÿÿÿGetting high marks,
ÿÿÿÿgood behavior.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿNice to teachers,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿintelligent...
ÿÿHere, it's hard.
ÿÿIt's really difficult.
She's not going to
ÿÿtake questions this morning.
.ÿÿÿÿÿÿAlthough she is a profound
ÿÿÿÿÿÿinfluential world leader..
she's also doing her GCSEs.
ÿÿSome people think,
ÿÿ"Malala is lucky,
ÿÿshe's now with...
"Hillary Clinton,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿshe's with Bono,
"she's with rock stars."
But on the other side,
I get homework as well.
Rock stars
ÿÿÿÿÿÿdon't need to do homework.
ÿÿ
.ÿÿÿÿI think rock stars are lucky
ÿÿWhen I told my school
I wouldn't be at school
for one week...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe teachers gave
me ÿÿÿÿÿÿextra homework.
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿShall I show you my tests
ÿÿÿÿand how much marks do I get?
Yeah, show me.
ÿÿIt's really embarrassing.
ÿÿThis is the biology test.
ÿÿI got 73%.
ÿÿI'm good
ÿÿin the first questions,
ÿÿwhich is all about hormones.
ÿÿ
ÿÿ
.ÿÿÿÿMy name's Malala
Is it true
ÿÿÿÿthat when you spoke
with President Obama...
ÿÿyou talked about your concern
that drone attacks
are fuelling terrorism?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿYes, of course.
ÿÿBecause I missed that lesson,
ÿÿI got only 1% in this question
ÿÿout of four.
This is
ÿÿunfortunately Physics.
What did you get?
In Physics,
ÿÿI got 61%.
So what do the girls do
ÿÿÿÿif they don't go to school?
..ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey clean dishes.
.ÿÿÿÿThey buy things
ÿÿÿÿfor other people
w.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI don't really kno
f.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey clean dishes
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand they do their stuf
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhat's so wrong with that?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI don't really kno
w, ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut it's bad.
My mother,
she was very beautiful.
Green eyes, maroon color hair,
fair skin.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhen she was five,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿshe was admitted to school
ÿÿÿÿÿÿby my grandfather.
ÿÿShe was the only girl
ÿÿin her class.
ÿÿÿÿShe realized
ÿÿÿÿthat all her female cousins
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwere not going to school.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey were playing
ÿÿÿÿÿÿin the fields.
ÿÿAt that time,
when you sold something,
ÿÿÿÿin return
ÿÿÿÿyou would either get food...
ÿÿÿÿyou would either
ÿÿÿÿget corn and flour.
She got candies.
ÿÿNobody asked her,
ÿÿ"Where are your books?
"Why are you not
ÿÿÿÿÿÿgoing to school?"
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThat was the end
ÿÿÿÿÿÿof her education.
ÿÿÿÿ
They used to go
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfrom town to town...
ÿÿÿÿand they used to make a heap
ÿÿof all the computers,
ÿÿTVs, CDs...
ÿÿand burned them on fire.
ÿÿÿÿ
The smoke
ÿÿÿÿused to reach to the clouds.
They did not want us
ÿÿÿÿto watch the television.
ÿÿÿÿAnd if they heard it, ever,
ÿÿÿÿthey would come
ÿÿÿÿinto your house by force...
they would take your TV
ÿÿÿÿand they would burn
ÿÿÿÿyour television.
e.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿPlease can you put
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe banana on the plat
ÿÿOn the plate?
s.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿYe
.ÿÿÿÿPlease pick up number 10
Is your mother
ÿÿÿÿÿÿhappy here?
y
ÿÿÿÿI think she is not that happ
because she doesn't
have friends.
ÿÿShe don't know
ÿÿthe language well.
t.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿBut I think
ÿÿÿÿÿÿshe will get used to i
ÿÿÿÿMy mother is like,
ÿÿÿÿthe best mom, I think, ever.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMaybe you have a special
ÿÿÿÿÿÿconnection to your mother.
Yeah, she loves me.
I'm the favorite one.
Yeah, I'm her favorite one.
ÿÿÿÿNot Malala?
Quarter past...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿSeven.
ÿÿYes.
The first time
I saw her, she was 14.
ÿÿI was dark in color...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿso my physical appearance
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwas not good in my eyes.
ÿÿÿÿAnd I thought
ÿÿÿÿthat I'm not a handsome boy.
ÿÿI had not beauty,
ÿÿshe had not education.
ÿÿÿÿShe saw her completion in me
ÿÿand I saw
ÿÿmy completion in her.
Is it unusual
ÿÿÿÿto have a marriage of love?
Love marriage
in America
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand love marriage
ÿÿÿÿÿÿin Pakistan...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿare very different things.
ÿÿYou can't have dates,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿyou can't have
ÿÿÿÿÿÿromantic meetings.
ÿÿYou only see someone,
ÿÿshe sees you...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand the next step is not
ÿÿÿÿÿÿany dating or any meeting.
The next step is to tell
your father and mother,
ÿÿ"I want that girl."
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿIn the very beginning,
ÿÿÿÿFazlullah was not violent...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut he became stronger
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand stronger and stronger.
ÿÿÿÿ
They started killing policemen
ÿÿand blasting police stations.
Taliban are
a small group of people.
They think that God is a tiny,
little, conservative being.
ÿÿBut for us,
ÿÿGod is not that tiny.
ÿÿGod has sent us to this world
ÿÿto see how would we live.
ÿÿÿÿWould they choose a bad way
ÿÿÿÿor a good way?
ÿÿ
ÿÿMy name is Shettima Harouna.
ÿÿMy daughter
ÿÿis Margaret Shettima.
ÿÿMy daughter is 17 years.
ÿÿHer name is Sarah Samwell.
It's 100 days
ÿÿsince Boko Haram
ÿÿabducted more than 200 girls.
The abduction
ÿÿÿÿof the Nigerian schoolgirls
ÿÿÿÿÿÿcontinues to dominate
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe national conversation.
For three months,
ÿÿparents called
ÿÿÿÿfor the safe return
ÿÿÿÿof their daughters.
ÿÿÿÿNow they hope it's the voice
ÿÿÿÿof a teenager
that will make the difference.
I'm still 17.
ÿÿI'm still a teenager.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhat should I do?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿHow can I help?
Malala Yousafzai
ÿÿÿÿhas joined the campaign
ÿÿÿÿto find Nigeria's
ÿÿÿÿmissing schoolgirls.
Much-needed help
ÿÿÿÿarriving with 17-year-old
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMalala Yousafzai
ÿÿÿÿÿÿnow in Nigeria...
ÿÿÿÿbringing with her
ÿÿÿÿworldwide attention.
President Jonathan
clearly hadn't expected
ÿÿthat Malala would be so tough
ÿÿand focused.
?"
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI asked the President,
"What promises do you make
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI met him today
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand I told him...
ÿÿ"You are
ÿÿthe elected President.
ÿÿ"You need to fulfill
ÿÿyour responsibilities.
ÿÿ"And your responsibility
ÿÿis to listen to your people."
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt is so hard to get
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthings done in this world.
ÿÿYou try, and too often
ÿÿit doesn't work.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿBut you have to continue,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand you never give up.
ÿÿÿÿ
If somebody
ÿÿsaid something
ÿÿopenly against the Taliban...
ÿÿthey would be warned.
ÿÿWe know about you.
ÿÿYou'll face the music.
ÿÿÿÿThey would go early
ÿÿÿÿin the morning...
ÿÿand next day
ÿÿhe would have been killed.
ÿÿÿÿ
Who was the person
who shot Malala?
ÿÿÿÿIt was not a person.
ÿÿÿÿIt was an ideology.
When I'm in a car,
ÿÿlooking through the window...
I like just to be silent
for a while.
ÿÿÿÿSometimes I feel
ÿÿÿÿthat I am in England
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut it's just
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor a short time.
ÿÿI'm not going
ÿÿto live here forever.
ÿÿWhen I think of Swat,
I think
that it's just a story.
ÿÿÿÿIt's something that happened
ÿÿand I can
ÿÿnever see Swat again.
What would happen
ÿÿif you went back today?
ÿÿÿÿIf I would go back,
ÿÿÿÿwould I be shot?
ÿÿOf course I would be.
ÿÿÿÿThey said, "If you come back
ÿÿÿÿwe're going to shoot you."
I just want to go once
just to see that house.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿJust once.
Just look at it.
ÿÿAtal.
ÿÿJust let me do something else.
ÿÿThis is boring.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe's looking
at ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe pictures.
Who's that?
ÿÿShane Watson.
.ÿÿÿÿThis is Shane Watson and he'
ÿÿÿÿa really good cricket player
ÿÿAnd there's another one
ÿÿas well,
who is one of my favorites.
ÿÿÿÿI think you like him
ÿÿÿÿmore than just for cricket.
ÿÿÿÿNo, I just like him
ÿÿÿÿfor cricket.
ÿÿAnd I also like Shahid Afridi.
Yeah?
ÿÿHe's the Pakistani cricketer.
He is an amazing cricketer.
One of the best cricketers.
ÿÿAnd he had the longest
and the biggest six
in history.
This one!
It's this one!
See?
ÿÿHe smashed it miles!
It went miles away.
.But he's
ÿÿÿÿnot good anymore
ÿÿÿÿHe is good.
ÿÿHe's getting old.
ÿÿHe can't even play.
Do you think
you could ever ask
ÿÿÿÿa boy out on a date?
ÿÿ
ÿÿMy brother can tell me
that he has got
a girlfriend...
d.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut I can't tell him
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthat I have got a boyfrien
ÿÿMalala says
ÿÿthat you can have a girlfriend
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut she can't have
ÿÿÿÿÿÿa boyfriend.
g.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI think she's wron
It's all up to her.
.Who's that?
I have no idea
Brad Pitt.
ÿÿÿÿIf there's a boy you like...
ÿÿwhy can't you pick up
ÿÿthe phone and ask him,
ÿÿ"Let's go to a movie"?
No, it would
be ÿÿÿÿÿÿquite embarrassing.
And the other thing is that
if my family would know,
m.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿit would be
ÿÿÿÿÿÿa surprise for the
ÿÿÿÿAnd they would be astonished
ÿÿÿÿ"Malala asked a boy?"
And there is Roger Federer.
You like him?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿYeah.
You like tennis
ÿÿÿÿor you like his haircut?
ÿÿI like his haircut.
It's always changing.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿOne of my friends,
ÿÿÿÿthe Taliban
ÿÿÿÿstopped their car...
and showed them
the head of a slaughtered man.
They said, "If you don't
follow the real Islam
"that we're showing you...
"then you can be the next
ÿÿÿÿÿÿperson like this man."
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey were not about faith.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey were about power.
ÿÿThey are cruel people
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwho are misusing
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe name of Islam.
They are the enemies of Islam.
ÿÿÿÿThey used to bring innocent
ÿÿÿÿpeople to the square...
ÿÿÿÿsometimes shoot them
ÿÿÿÿin the square
ÿÿÿÿand sometimes slaughter them
ÿÿÿÿin the square.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey used to leave a note
ÿÿÿÿÿÿon the body...
"If you go against
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe Taliban,
ÿÿ"this could be you tomorrow."
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMany people, they thought
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthat if they speak...
ÿÿÿÿthey will be killed
ÿÿÿÿthe very next day.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI was feeling that
ÿÿÿÿÿÿif I don't speak,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI would be the most
ÿÿsinful and the most guilty man
ÿÿin this world.
ÿÿÿÿAs a schoolboy,
ÿÿÿÿthe hardest times...
ÿÿÿÿwere the moments when
ÿÿÿÿa teacher asked me to stand
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand read a passage
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfrom a book.
Tell me about
ÿÿÿÿÿÿyour father's stammer.
ÿÿWhen he talks?
ÿÿYeah.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMmm.
ÿÿ Malala. Malala.
One thing that
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI noticed in my father...
ÿÿÿÿeven if he stammers
ÿÿÿÿfor one minute,
ÿÿhe will try to say that word.
He never stops.
ÿÿThe first time
ÿÿyou can just stop it.
ÿÿAnd you can say
ÿÿanother word instead.
ÿÿBut my father never does that.
My father
ÿÿwas a very passionate
ÿÿand emotional speaker.
A fiery speaker.
ÿÿÿÿThe most eloquent man
ÿÿÿÿI have ever seen in my life.
ÿÿÿÿHe used to give sermons
ÿÿÿÿin the mosque every Friday.
ÿÿÿÿMy father would be shouting
ÿÿand speaking like just
ÿÿbringing out fires.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI asked my father,
"Can you write a speech
for me?"
"Look. You utter
ÿÿÿÿÿÿone sentence in a minute.
ÿÿ"You stutter, stutter,
ÿÿstammer, stammer.
ÿÿÿÿ"How will you speak
ÿÿÿÿto public?"
My name was announced,
I went to the podium...
ÿÿÿÿI was speaking to the people
ÿÿÿÿbut I did not see them.
ÿÿÿÿAnd when I ended my speech,
ÿÿone of my teachers
ÿÿcame to me and told...
ÿÿ"Ziauddin,
ÿÿyou spread the fire."
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI got encouraged.
I didn't keep silent. I spoke.
ÿÿÿÿBecause this is me.
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿBecause this is me.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIf I keep silent, I think,
ÿÿÿÿthen you lose
ÿÿÿÿthe right to exist.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThe right to live.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIf my rights are violated
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand I keep silent,
ÿÿÿÿI should better die
ÿÿÿÿthan to live.
I would worry
ÿÿabout my father.
ÿÿÿÿSome of his friends
ÿÿÿÿwere attacked
and some of his friends
were killed.
The Taliban leader
ÿÿÿÿÿÿannounced my name
ÿÿÿÿÿÿon his FM radio.
ÿÿÿÿI used to change my routine.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI used to keep
ÿÿÿÿÿÿa random kind of schedule.
It was really hard
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto sleep.
ÿÿI could see
ÿÿa lot of scary things.
ÿÿÿÿUsually, the Taliban killed
ÿÿÿÿpeople at nighttime.
ÿÿI would go outside...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI would check every door.
ÿÿ"That gate is closed,
ÿÿso they cannot come
ÿÿfrom that gate."
ÿÿ"That door is locked,
ÿÿso they cannot come
ÿÿfrom that door."
ÿÿÿÿ"God, protect my father.
ÿÿ"Protect our family."
ÿÿThe Nobel Peace Prize,
ÿÿÿÿthe average age
ÿÿÿÿof the winner is 62.
But tonight,
the youngest nominee is
a 16-year-old girl.
ÿÿ
Malala
is the daughter of the nation.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe is doing great work
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor the girls' education.
She's like a role model
to all our girls.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe's even a favorite now
ÿÿto win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Nobel Peace Prize,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿif I get it,
ÿÿÿÿit would be an honor for me.
ÿÿIt would help me
ÿÿin my campaign
ÿÿfor girls' education.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMalala is a brave,
intelligent girl
from our valley.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿShe lit the candle of
ÿÿÿÿÿÿknowledge in our country.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMalala was a girl like us.
ÿÿÿÿShe's inspiring us.
ÿÿÿÿOne of the most importan
t ÿÿÿÿfactors for Hitler...
She's a goodwill ambassador
of Pakistan
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand we're definite
ly ÿÿÿÿÿÿsupporting her.
ÿÿIn her hometown today,
schoolchildren prayed
she would win the Nobel.
.ÿÿÿÿGood morning,
ÿÿÿÿladies and gentlemen
ÿÿÿÿThe Norwegian Nobel Committe
ÿÿÿÿhas decided...
ÿÿthat the Nobel Peace Prize
ÿÿfor 2013...
ÿÿis to be awarded
ÿÿto the Organization
s.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor the Prohibitio
n ÿÿÿÿÿÿof Chemical Weapon
They must have made
ÿÿa decision on merit...
ÿÿso we should honor it,
ÿÿwe should accept it,
ÿÿand we should be happy
ÿÿfor that.
Awards doesn't matter.
ÿÿPeople have supported me,
ÿÿand that is the greatest award
ÿÿI have deserved.
If awards
ÿÿÿÿdon't matter, what matters?
ÿÿReally, change matters.
ÿÿChange matters.
ÿÿÿÿ
The Taliban
ÿÿÿÿstarted the campaign
ÿÿÿÿthat girls' educatio
n ÿÿÿÿis against Islam...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand girls should n
ot ÿÿÿÿÿÿgo to school.
ÿÿ
Education
ÿÿwas a threat to them.
ÿÿEducation gives you the power
ÿÿto question things.
The power to challenge things.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿTo be independent.
ÿÿ
We have given
ÿÿÿÿÿÿscholarships to many girls
ÿÿall around the world.
Little girls.
ÿÿThey're only six and seven...
ÿÿwho'll be going to
ÿÿother people's houses
ÿÿto clean their houses.
ÿÿAnd now these girls
ÿÿare getting education.
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿ
It's very difficult
to forget all those good days.
ÿÿWhen I was
ÿÿfacing those girls...
ÿÿit was lovely.
I dream that
one day I'll go back...
ÿÿÿÿand I will meet
ÿÿÿÿall my students, my people.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThat would be
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthe greatest day,
ÿÿÿÿthe happiest day of my life.
ÿÿÿÿ
Three schools
bombed in Matta.
ÿÿTwo more schools in Charbagh.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿOne more school in Kabal.
When they
ÿÿÿÿÿÿcame to our town,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthey bombed three schools
ÿÿÿÿÿÿin one night.
It brought fear.
ÿÿÿÿIt scared children.
ÿÿÿÿThey thought that
ÿÿÿÿif they go to school
ÿÿthey might be killed.
Many
ÿÿÿÿÿÿinternational journalists
ÿÿÿÿÿÿused to go from
ÿÿÿÿÿÿperson to person.
ÿÿÿÿEverybody said,
ÿÿÿÿ"No, I can't speak.
"I can't risk my life."
ÿÿThe BBC correspondent said...
"We need someone to
write a diary of Swat."
The first girl
ÿÿtold her whole story,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwhat happened on her day.
ÿÿThe next day,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿher father came to school
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand told my father...
ÿÿÿÿ"My daughter cannot do this.
"I do not want her
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto be killed."
ÿÿÿÿMy father asked me,
ÿÿÿÿ"Would you like to?"
ÿÿÿÿMy mother would say,
ÿÿ"It's written
ÿÿin the holy Qur'an...
"that truth has to come
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand falsehood has to die."
ÿÿEvery night
ÿÿthe BBC correspondent
would call me...
ÿÿÿÿand I would tell him
ÿÿÿÿwhat my feelings are
and what happened all the day.
They changed my name
and gave me a pseudonym,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿGul Makai.
ÿÿÿÿSo you moved houses?
This is, you can
ÿÿÿÿÿÿcall it the fourth house.
Fourth?
ÿÿYeah.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿFirst, my mother, father,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthey were in a hostel.
ÿÿÿÿThen they moved
ÿÿÿÿto an apartment.
ÿÿThen we went to another house.
ÿÿWe stayed there
ÿÿmaybe for six, seven months,
ÿÿand now we are here.
What's your
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfavorite book of all time?
ÿÿÿÿNo, don't ask
ÿÿÿÿdifficult questions.
I like this book,
A Brief History of Time,
but it's quite difficult
to understand.
ÿÿÿÿYou have to read it
ÿÿÿÿthree, four times.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿAnd then the book
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwhich is my favorite book,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿis The Alchemist.
ÿÿÿÿOver there, the yellow one.
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿSo, there's another book,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿit's quite...
ÿÿShow me the book. What is it?
ÿÿÿÿHere's another book.
ÿÿÿÿIt's quite boring.
So this is I Am Malala.
ÿÿÿÿWritten by Malala
ÿÿÿÿwith Christina Lamb.
And someone has given me
an autograph.
ÿÿSomeone has signed it.
ÿÿÿÿAnd her name is also Malala.
ÿÿ"Dear Malala,
ÿÿwell done, keep it up.
ÿÿ"Best of luck, Malala."
ÿÿÿÿPrivate schools in Pakistan
ÿÿÿÿare banning a book
ÿÿÿÿwritten by Malala Yousafzai.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThe school board president
said Malala represented
the views of the West.
There are many other people
y.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwho are doing much more
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor the Pakistani communit
ÿÿThat's a big question for us.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWhy she's getting
ÿÿÿÿÿÿso much attention.
She's getting a lot of fame
ÿÿÿÿÿÿand I think it's more
of ÿÿÿÿÿÿa publicity stunt.
ÿÿÿÿMalala is just
ÿÿÿÿname of a character.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt can be anyone.
She's a girl.
She don't know anything.
ÿÿ
I've noticed
something about you.
ÿÿYeah?
You don't like
ÿÿto talk about your suffering.
ÿÿYou're avoiding the question.
I am?
ÿÿÿÿYou're avoiding my question.
Of course I am.
You don't like
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto talk about it.
ÿÿÿÿWell, I don't know.
Every night you would hear
the noises of the bomb blasts.
ÿÿAnd in the morning,
ÿÿthe school was no more there.
ÿÿThey destroyed
ÿÿmore than 400 schools.
ÿÿÿÿFinally, the Taliban
ÿÿÿÿbecame so strong...
they could make a demand
ÿÿÿÿÿÿmore devastating
ÿÿÿÿÿÿthan their bombs.
ÿÿÿÿ
The Taliban said that
ÿÿno girl can go to school...
ÿÿand if she goes,
ÿÿthen you know what we can do.
ÿÿThe government decided
to take military action
against the Taliban.
There was fighting everywhere.
With millions of others,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿour family had to leave
ÿÿÿÿÿÿour beautiful Swat Valley.
ÿÿFor three months,
ÿÿwe moved from place to place.
ÿÿÿÿRefugees in our own country.
What's his name?
ÿÿMalik.
ÿÿThere's no schools.
ÿÿRanim used to go to school
ÿÿbecause she's six,
ÿÿbut now they've destroyed
ÿÿthe schools.
No matter
ÿÿÿÿwhere you go in the world...
no matter what country,
what religion...
ÿÿyou will find children
ÿÿwho are out of school.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIn just three years,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ3 million Syrian children
are no longer in school.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿEach day,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿhundreds cross the border
ÿÿto escape war.
ÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿPeople argue about the war
ÿÿand debate
ÿÿabout the politics...
ÿÿÿÿbut who is thinking
ÿÿÿÿabout the children?
ÿÿWhen we returned home
ÿÿwe were hopeful.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿBut those old, busy roads
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwere vacant.
Many houses and schools
were destroyed.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThe Taliban
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwere no more on the roads,
ÿÿbut the target killing
ÿÿcontinued.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿOur beautiful school
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwas used in the fighting.
ÿÿÿÿIt was school where I would
ÿÿÿÿsee my friends every day.
ÿÿÿÿWhere we would learn
ÿÿÿÿevery day.
It was school which was
giving me hope...
ÿÿwhich was building up
ÿÿmy future.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThere is a moment
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwhen you have to choose...
ÿÿÿÿwhether to be silent
ÿÿÿÿor to stand up.
Sometimes
ÿÿÿÿsome people just say that...
one should protect his life...
ÿÿÿÿprotect his family.
When I was little,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿmany people would say...
ÿÿ"Change Malala's name.
"It's a bad name,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿit means sad."
ÿÿÿÿÿÿBut my father
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwould always say,
ÿÿÿÿ"No, it has another meaning.
"Bravery."
The BBC blog,
it was very safe.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt was anonymous.
ÿÿBut it was not enough.
I knew
what the risk would be,
ÿÿÿÿstanding in front of
ÿÿÿÿthe camera.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿHe didn't push me.
ÿÿÿÿHe let me do what I wanted.
ÿÿÿÿWhen every man was losing
ÿÿÿÿcourage at the battlefield,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿa woman raised her voice.
ÿÿSpeak, Malala.
ÿÿSpeak from your heart.
Speak what's inside your soul.
ÿÿÿÿ
She was
ÿÿthe first one who named them.
We started
sneaking to the school.
Going secretly.
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿThey'll never kill a child.
ÿÿI never, never expected that.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI have the right to sing.
I have the right
to go to market.
ÿÿI have the right to speak up.
I will get my education
if it is in home,
ÿÿÿÿschool or any place.
ÿÿÿÿThey cannot stop me.
ÿÿI was in a press club
ÿÿÿÿand it was my turn to speak.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿMy friend received a call.
ÿÿÿÿ"Malala's school bus
ÿÿÿÿhas been attacked."
She was taken
to a military hospital.
ÿÿThe doctors performed
ÿÿan emergency surgery.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThere were a lot of people
ÿÿÿÿÿÿin the hospital.
ÿÿNobody thought
ÿÿthat she will survive.
Me and my wife,
we cried all the night.
The doctors made
ÿÿÿÿthe decision to move her.
ÿÿÿÿThe plane that she's in now,
ÿÿÿÿprovided by
ÿÿÿÿthe United Arab Emirates...
ÿÿis a special air ambulance...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt wasn't certain
that she could survive.
A large
ÿÿÿÿÿÿpiece of bone was removed
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwhen her brain
ÿÿÿÿÿÿstarted swelling.
Although she was
on very strong antibiotics,
she had some infection.
Sepsis has got
ÿÿÿÿa very high mortality rate.
The procedure
ÿÿÿÿÿÿshe will be undergoing
ÿÿÿÿin the next week...
is putting a titanium plate
over the deficit in her skull.
Malala's kidneys
had started to shut down.
ÿÿHer blood acid levels
ÿÿhad started to rise.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿHer blood had
ÿÿÿÿÿÿstopped clotting properly.
Malala is still
ÿÿÿÿÿÿshowing some signs
ÿÿÿÿÿÿof infection.
ÿÿÿÿShe has undergone
ÿÿÿÿa further surgical procedure
ÿÿto repair
ÿÿher left facial nerve.
She wasn't
ÿÿÿÿmoving her right side well.
ÿÿÿÿThat area of the brain was
ÿÿÿÿstill not working properly.
The second part
ÿÿÿÿof the procedure
ÿÿÿÿshe'll be undergoing
ÿÿÿÿa cochlear implant.
I was
ÿÿÿÿÿÿvery worried that survival
ÿÿÿÿwould be with
ÿÿÿÿmajor disabilities.
When she first woke up,
she didn't believe that
her father was alive.
ÿÿÿÿShe had got it into her head
that he'd been targeted
and he was dead.
ÿÿÿÿEvery time I saw her
ÿÿÿÿshe asked me,
"So where's my father?"
We were thinking,
"What Malala
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwill be thinking?"
ÿÿÿÿ"I was a child.
ÿÿÿÿYou should have stopped me.
"What has happened to me
is because of you."
ÿÿÿÿThe doctors told me,
ÿÿÿÿ"She will survive."
ÿÿBut would she recover?
ÿÿAnd...
Like this. Good.
ÿÿÿÿThere was still a fear that
ÿÿÿÿshe may not be
ÿÿÿÿthe same as she was.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWould she be able to walk?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWould she be able to talk?
ÿÿOkay.
ÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿWould she be able to speak
ÿÿas she used to speak?
ÿÿWith the same spirit?
It is a miracle
ÿÿÿÿthat you are
ÿÿÿÿhere with us today.
You had to overcome
an attempt on your life.
ÿÿÿÿGrievous injuries
ÿÿÿÿinflicted by a gun.
ÿÿÿÿMonths in hospital.
ÿÿYou have been taken
ÿÿfrom your own country
ÿÿthat you love.
ÿÿÿÿLet me say the words
the Taliban never wanted
her to hear...
a.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿHappy 16th birthday, Malal
e
ÿÿÿÿIt is an honor for m
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto be speaking aga
in ÿÿÿÿÿÿafter a long time.
ÿÿThank you to every person
ÿÿwho has prayed
ÿÿfor my fast recovery...
ÿÿand a new life.
ÿÿThe Taliban shot me
ÿÿon the left side
ÿÿof my forehead.
ÿÿThey shot my friends, too.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey thought that the bull
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwould silence us.
But nothing changed
except this:
ÿÿWeakness, fear
ÿÿand hopelessness died.
.ÿÿÿÿStrength, power
ÿÿÿÿand courage was born
.ÿÿÿÿI am the same Malala
ÿÿMy ambitions are the same.
My hopes are the same
and my dreams are the same.
We realize
the importance of light
ÿÿwhen we see darkness.
ÿÿÿÿWe realize
ÿÿÿÿthe importance of our voice
ÿÿwhen we are silenced.
ÿÿWe believe in the power
ÿÿand the strength of our words.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿToday is the day
ÿÿÿÿÿÿof every woman...
ÿÿÿÿevery boy and every girl...
ÿÿÿÿÿÿwho has raised their voice
ÿÿÿÿÿÿfor their rights.
Let us pick up
our books and our pens.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿThey are our most
ÿÿÿÿÿÿpowerful weapons.
.ÿÿÿÿOne child, one teacher..
.ÿÿÿÿone book and one pen
ÿÿÿÿcan change the world
ÿÿ
ÿÿI have been given a new life.
ÿÿÿÿAnd this life,
ÿÿÿÿthis life is a sacred life.
One more game of Snap.
ÿÿ Yeah,

Okay, so one...

(TOOR SPEAKING INDISTINCTL
Khushal,
you're not taking the card.
You're so slow.
e.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿOne, two, thre
ÿÿOh!
ÿÿI'm donkey? I'm your father.
ÿÿWhat are you saying?
ÿÿYour father's a donkey.
t.
No,
ÿÿit's just a game.
I didn't say i
ÿÿÿÿMalalai, she made a choice.
ÿÿ"I might get shot
ÿÿbut I'm gonna do it."
But your father
made the choice
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto pick this life for you.
ÿÿNo.
ÿÿMy father only gave me
ÿÿthe name Malalai.
ÿÿHe didn't make me Malalai.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI chose this life.
It was not forced on me.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt was not told to me
ÿÿÿÿÿÿto live such kind of life.
ÿÿÿÿI chose this life
ÿÿÿÿand now I must continue it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
ÿÿgood morning.
ÿÿThe Norwegian Nobel Committee
ÿÿhas decided...
ÿÿthat the Nobel Peace Prize

A conscience
ÿÿexists in the world...
ÿÿthat extends
ÿÿbeyond all boundaries.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿIt says that children
ÿÿÿÿÿÿhave a right to childhood.
I tell my story
ÿÿÿÿnot because it is unique...
ÿÿbut because it is not.
It is the story of many girls.
a.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI am Malala,
ÿÿÿÿÿÿbut I'm also Shazi
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI'm Kainat.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿI'm Kainat Soomro.
ÿÿI'm Mezon. I'm Amina.

ÿÿÿÿAnd our voices have grow
n ÿÿÿÿlouder and louder.
