THAT IN THESE CITIES

WINTHROP.
SIR GUY?
WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PAPER,
IT HAD ONE OF THE HIGHEST
CIRCULATIONS OF ANY SUNDAY

IT WAS A PAPER...
WITH A HEART, WINTHROP,

HEAR! HEAR!
AND A CIRCULATION.
NOW JUST LOOK AT THIS.
READ IT OUT, WINTHROP.
BUT, SIR GUY, YOU SAID, UH--
YES, I KNOW WHAT I SAID,
BUT READ IT.
"DETECTIVES MADE INQUIRIES
FROM HOLIDAY MAKERS

WHAT IS AUJOURD'HUI,
WINTHROP?
IT'S FRENCH FOR "TODAY,"

THIS IS MICHAEL BARRETT
REPORTING FROM THE FAMOUS
CRUFT'S DOG SHOW...
AND HERE'S MR. UMBONGO
JUST AFTER THE INCIDENT.
A NEW BREED OF DOG--
IF IN FACT IT WAS A DOG--
MADE A SPECTACULARLY
UNFORTUNATE DEBUT AT THE SHOW
WHEN IT OPENED HERE TODAY.
THE ENDURING QUESTION
WAS THE SO-CALLED CONGO
BLACK DOG KNOWN AS,
OR REGISTERED ANYWAY,
AS "BIG FANG."
AND IT'S A CURIOUS
CATLIKE CREATURE.
TODAY COVERED IN A POODLE-TYPE
COAT WHICH ALMOST
OBSCURED ITS FACE.
WHEN ITS OWNER, MR. UMBONGO
FROM MASAWA IN WEST AFRICA
TOOK IT INTO THE ARENA,
THE BEAST WENT
ABSOLUTELY BERSERK.
IT FEROCIOUSLY ATTACKED
THE OTHER ENTRIES.
THERE WAS DEVASTATION.
THERE WAS HAVOC, NEAR PANIC
IN THE GALLERIES.
AND IT'S REPORTED THAT
THE DOG WAS ACTUALLY EATING...
AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER
OF ITS FELLOW ENTRIES.
THIS IS MICHAEL BARRETT
RETURNING YOU TO THE STUDIO.
OH, SO DREADFUL, GUY!
SWITCH IT OVER.
THAT'S BETTER.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW A THING
LIKE THAT COULD HAPPEN
AT CRUFT'S.
A DIRECT HIT
ON ST. PETE'S, DAD.
GOOD, GOOD.
GOOD, YOUNGMAN, GOOD.
COOK CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITH THE GROUSE, GUY.
SHE SAYS THEY'RE BURNT
TO A CINDER.
INCOMPETENCE IN THE KITCHEN,
EH, SISTER?
GUY? GUY?
COOK SAID THEY WERE LIKE THAT
WHEN SHE OPENED THE GAME BAG.
CARRY ON, YOUNGMAN.
ALL ASHES AND BONES.
ASHES AND BONES IN THE GAME BAG?
HO-HO. I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.
- EH, YOUNGMAN?
- ME NEITHER, DAD.
THERE.
GUY, WE SIMPLY MUST EAT
BECAUSE I'M STARVING.
NOW COME ALONG.
WHAT? WHAT?
- I'M STARVING.
- THE WHOLE WORLD'S STARVING.
WELL, LOOK HERE, SISTER.
LET ME SAY IF-- IF COOK...
HAS IN FACT SPOILED
OUR TABLE BIRD,
WHY DON'T WE ALL GO DOWN
TO CHEZ EDUARD.
WHERE, IF MEMORY SERVES,
AN HONEST WORKING MAN
CAN STILL GET A GOOD
LANCASHIRE HOT POT.
CHEZ EDUARD'S SUCH FUN.
THAT'S A SPLENDID IDEA.
CAN'T WE SETTLE
OUR DIFFERENCES AMICABLY?
NO, SON. NO.
NOT WHILE THERE'S
A CATHEDRAL STANDING.
YOO-HOO.
GOOD EVENING, SIR GUY.
GOOD EVENING, SIR GUY.

I'VE BEEN IMPOSING MYSELF
FOR ONE OF YOUR GASTRONOMIC
EXPERIENCES FOR SOME TIME.
- WAITER.
- EVERYTHING IS PREPARED
AS YOU ORDERED.
GOOD, GOOD. THEN I SUGGEST
WE WASTE NO MORE TIME.
GUY, AREN'T YOU DINING
WITH US?
NO, DEAR AGNES, NO.
WHEN THE GOURMET MOOD
IS ON ME,
MY NEEDS MUST DINE ALONE.
YOU REMEMBER CHARLES,
SIR GUY?
CHARLES, CHARLES.
[ Speaks French ]
THE ADEN OFFENSIVE,
WAS IT NOT?
GIVE US ONE OF THE OLD ONES,
CHARLES. I LOVE THE OLD ONES.
MAY I SUGGEST
THE POUR COMMENCER,
C'EST CE PAS CAVIAR?
THE CAVIAR, YES.
BELUGA, OF COURSE.
CERTAINMENTE.
BELUGA.
[ Speaking French ]
IT'S VERY INTERESTING,
EDUARD.
BUT TONIGHT I FANCY...
PUTTING YOUR CANARD
A L'ORANGE TO THE TEST.
[ Grunts ]
YOU HAVE HEARD.
IT IS THE CANARD
A L'ORANGE.
[ French ]
UH, SOMMELIER, YES.
YES, THAT'LL DO VERY NICELY.
SIR GUY GRAND.
LAST OF THE GREAT GOURMETS.
DO YOU APPROVE
OF THE WINE, SIR GUY?
THE CORK IS '47.
IS THE WINE AUSSI,
SIR GUY?
A RARE COMBINATION.
[ Gargling ]
THIS PLUCKY LITTLE BURGUNDY
HAS GOT MY JUICES A FLOWING.
MERCI, SIR GUY.
[ Both Speaking French ]
EXTRAORDINAIRE.
[ French ]
WITH MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,
SIXTY PENCE.
OH, ANOTHER FIRST
FOR ENGLAND.
[ Shouts ]
THAT'S BETTER.
[ French ]
GOD ALMIGHTY, WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE? WAITER!
[ Customers Shouting ]
YOU KNOW, EDUARD,
THE ODD THING
ABOUT CAVIAR...
IS THAT ONE NEVER
GETS ENOUGH TOAST.
TOAST, SIR GUY?
NO, THANK YOU.
I NEVER TOUCH IT.
[ French ]
MM-HMM.
THE CHOPPED EGG.
WHERE A FISH
IS A STURGEON,
THIS CAN ONLY COME
FROM A VIRGIN.
MMM!
[ French ]
YES, IT IS '47.
EXCELLENT.
YES, THANK YOU.
THIS IS THE CANARD.
YES, I LOVE IT.
YES, I MUST SPEAK
WITH THE CHEF.
I MUST SPEAK

[ Man Over P.A. ]
GENTLEMEN, A BIG HAND
FOR A GOOD LOSER.
[ Crowd Jeering ]
BUT, GUY, I THOUGHT
YOU SAID IT WAS TO BE
A SOIREE MUSICALE.
HOLD IT, TIGER.
BIG SMILE.
IT'S THE CHAMPIONSHIP,
AUNT AGNES. IKE JONES
AND JOE THOMPSON.
¶ [ Trumpets ]
CHALLENGER JOE THOMPSON
HAS JUST CLIMBED INTO THE RING
LOOKING VERY FIT.
VERY FIT INDEED.
AND GETTING A WARM
ROUND OF APPLAUSE...
FROM THIS FINE SPORTING CROWD
HERE TONIGHT.
ALL OF THEM ASKING THEMSELVES
THE SAME QUESTION: CAN THE
CHALLENGER DELIVER HIS PUNCH?
YOU KNOW HE'S GOT IT,
BUT CAN HE DELIVER IT?
WILL HE STAY CONSCIOUS
LONG ENOUGH TO DELIVER IT?
GOOD EVENING, MILADY.
HELLO.
[ Muttering ]
AH, JEFF, LAST OF
THE OLD BULLDOG BREED, EH?
AND HERE HE COMES NOW,
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD, IKE JONES.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
JUST LISTEN TO
THE RECEPTION HE'S GETTING.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS CROWD.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE RECORD
OF THESE TWO RUGGED CUSTOMERS.
I HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE THIS MAY BE
AN EXCEPTIONAL BOUT. YES.
JONES MAY BE STRONG, GRANTED.
BUT IN MY OPINION,
JOE THOMPSON COULD
EASILY BE THAT MUCH
TOO NIMBLE FOR HIM.
EH, JEFF?
CERTAINLY, SIR.
WELL, BOTH THESE MEN
MOUNT THE RING...
WITH VERY IMPRESSIVE RECORDS
BEHIND THEM.
THE CHAMPION HAS BEEN UNBEATEN
IN A TOTAL OF 78 BOUTS.
HE'S NEVER BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
IN FACT,
HE'S NEVER EVEN BEEN
KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET.
BUT HE HAS HAD TO TAKE
PLENTY OF PUNISHMENT
FROM TIME TO TIME.
IKE JONES IS CERTAINLY
NOT HIDING BEHIND
THE DOOR, AS THEY SAY,
WHEN FIGHTING HEART
AND GUTS WAS BEING HANDED OUT.
MY LORDS, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS THE MAIN EVENT...
OF THE EVENING.
FIFTEEN ROUNDS OF BOXING...

CHAMPIONSHIP...
OF THE WORLD...

IKE JONES!
[ Crowd Cheering ]
FIGHTERS MOVE TO THE CENTER OF
THE RING. THEY'RE GETTING FINAL
INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE REFEREE.
BOTH FIGHTERS LOOKING CONFIDENT
AND RELAXED.
AND THE CROWD HERE
AT THIS ARENA SETTLES BACK
FOR WHAT PROMISES TO BE...
A VERY HARD AND LIVELY SCRAP...
BETWEEN THESE TWO GIANTS.
NOW THEY'VE RETURNED
TO THEIR CORNERS
AND WE WAIT FOR THE BELL.
HIT HIM STRAIGHT
IN THE EYE.
- [ Muttering ]

OUR FIRST ROUND OF
THIS BRUTAL MATCH
FOR THE HEAVYWEIGHT CROWN.
BOTH BOYS CIRCLING
EACH OTHER NOW CAREFULLY.
EACH MEASURING HIS MAN.
SHOWING DUE RESPECT
FOR THE LETHAL POWER
IN THE GLOVES OF THE OPPONENT.
[ Cheering Ceases ]
YOU'RE TOO MUCH.
COME ON THEN.
[ Crowd Gasps ]
[ Referee ]
ONE, TWO,
GUY, THOSE MEN ARE ABSURD.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
JUST GOOD FRIENDS.
[ Crowd Jeering ]
[ Announcer ]
THE CROWD SEEM
TO BE SICKENED...
BY THE SIGHT OF NO BLOOD.
[ Guy ]
THERE THEY ARE, SON.
THE DARK BLUES.
THE OXFORD CREW.
STOUT HEARTS, THE LOT.
WHERE ARE THEY GOING, DAD?
[ Guy ]
NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR.
BACK AND FORTH.
BACK AND FORTH.
WORKING OUT.
HONING THE EDGE,
IF ONE MAY DARE TO COIN.
THEY'RE PRACTICING
FOR THE BIG RACE WITH
THE CAMBRIDGE EIGHT.
THAT'LL BE OUR MAN, SON.
WE'LL BE WANTING A WORD
WITH HIM.
¶ IF YOU WANT IT
HERE IT IS

¶ MAKE YOUR MIND UP FAST

ANYTIME I CAN GIVE IT ¶

'CAUSE IT MAY NOT LAST ¶
[ Chattering Indistinctly ]
¶ DID I HEAR YOU SAY
THAT THERE MUST BE A CATCH ¶
¶ WILL YOU WALK AWAY
FROM A FOOL AND HIS MONEY ¶
STEP INSIDE.
WELL, THAT MUCH IS DONE.
DONE AND DOUBLE DONE.
BIT SURPRISED HE WENT
FOR IT, ACTUALLY.
I MEAN, THE RACE BEING
SUCH A TRADITIONAL THING
AND ALL THAT.
WELL, SON, AS YOU
PROCEED ALONG THE
GREAT ROAD OF LIFE,
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO
AS THE "YELLOW BRICK ROAD,"
YOU'LL FIND THAT THE--
AHA.
[ Blowing Nose ]
I SAY, WHAT'S
ALL THIS ABOUT?
WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF THIS, SON? WHAT DO
YOU THINK THIS IS?
LOOKS LIKE AN ADVERT?
"WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?"
YES.
THIS CAR IS PARKED
IN A LOADING ZONE.
AND IT'S LUCKY FOR YOU
IT WASN'T TOWED AWAY
FOR THAT MATTER.
WHAT IS THIS THING?
WHAT IS IT?
NOW THAT-- THAT HAPPENS
TO BE A PARKING TICKET...
THAT I'VE ISSUED TO YOU
FOR THE VIOLATION.
BUT MY SON THOUGHT
IT WAS AN ADVERT,
DIDN'T YOU?
WHAT?
I THOUGHT IT
WAS AN ADVERT.
YES, I CAN'T SEE
THE POINT OF IT MYSELF.
I REALLY CAN'T SEE
THE POINT AT ALL.
THE POINT IS THAT
YOU ARE IN VIOLATION.
YOU VIOLATED
THE TRAFFIC RULE...
[ Horn Honks ]
[ Cab Driver ]
GET OUT OF IT!
BY PARKING YOUR CAR
IN A LOADING ZONE.
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOADING ZONE?
THERE'S NO LOADING
GOING ON AROUND HERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE SODS
ARE DOING WITH THEM
PRESSURIZED FERKINS THEN?
TELL ME THAT THEN.
PRESSURIZED FERKINS.
FERKINS.
YOU KNOW,
NOT MANY YEARS AGO,
I CAN RECALL THE DAY...
WHEN YOU COULD BUY
A DECENT PRESSURIZED FERKIN
FOR A COUPLE OF POUNDS.
[ Officer ]
LET GO, SIR.
THE WHOLE THING IS THESE SODS
AREN'T LOADING PRESSURIZED
FERKINS. THEY'RE UNLOADING.
CONSTABLE, THERE'S THE RUB.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE
AT ALL. AND DON'T
CALL ME CONSTABLE.
IT'S WARDEN.
NOT SERGEANT, WARDEN.
WELL, THEN, ARE YOU
TRYING TO TELL ME,
SERGEANT WARDEN,
IS THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
LOADING AND UNLOADING?
WHAT'S HE DOIN'?
HE LOOKS LIKE A BLEEDIN'
NUTCASE TO ME.
WHY DON'T YOU GET
YOUR BLEEDIN' HAIR CUT?
"NUMBER SEVEN:
THE SILENT SCREAM.
"OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND EYES

WHAT'S YOUR GAME THEN?
UH, GRAND IS THE NAME.
AND, UH, MONEY IS THE GAME.
WOULD YOU CARE TO PLAY?
"MAKE IT AS TINY
AS YOU CAN.

DISAPPEAR."
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID THEN?
CAN YOU SEE THIS FACSIMILE

GOD BLESS HER.
JUST A MINUTE. WHAT WAS
THAT YOU SAID BEFORE?
OH, MY SUGGESTION IS...
THAT IF YOU'RE PREPARED
TO EAT THAT PARKING TICKET,
I WILL GIVE YOU £500 STERLING
FOR EATING IT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
ME EAT THAT-THAT?
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.

THAT YOU'RE--
YOU'RE WILLING TO
GIVE ME 500 QUID...

IT'S TO AVOID OFFENDING

[ Announcer ]
GOOD AFTERNOON,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AND WELCOME TO LONDON
FOR THIS GREAT AND GRAND
HISTORICAL EVENT--
THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE
BOAT RACE.
AND, AS I LOOK AT IT NOW,
IT SEEMS WE'VE GOT THE MOST
PERFECT WEATHER OVERHEAD.
THEY'RE WONDERFUL CONDITIONS.
THEY REALLY ARE. AND, UH--
CAMBRIDGE EIGHT
HAVE JUST APPEARED.
AND WE'RE WAITING NOW
FOR THE MUCH-FANCIED
OXFORD CREW.
WELL, THEN, NOW
BREAK IT UP, CHAPS, WILL YOU?
GATHER AROUND.
I, UH--
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
SIR GUY GRAND...
AND HIS SON,
YOUNGMAN GRAND.
[ Exchanging Greetings ]
SIR GUY'S COME DOWN
WITH A VERY INTERESTING
PROPOSITION TO US.
- SIR GUY.
- LADS, WE, UH,
HAD A LITTLE IDEA
CONCERNING THE RACE.
YES.
YES. YES.
AN ENDEAVOR, YOU MIGHT SAY,
TO MAKE IT SOMEWHAT MORE...
INTERESTING
THIS YEAR.
[ Announcer ]
CAMBRIDGE ARE MAKING THEIR WAY
TO THE STARTING POSITION,
BUT THERE'S STILL
NO SIGN OF OXFORD.
WE'RE HERE,
IN FACT, TO MAKE YOU
A VERY INTERESTING OFFER.
[ Youngman ]
OF MONEY.
[ All Laughing ]
- I THINK THEY'RE
TRYING TO BRIBE US.
- THEY ARE.
OXFORD STILL HAVEN'T PUT IN
AN APPEARANCE, AND THE CROWD'S
GETTING JUST A BIT RESTIVE.
IT'S REALLY MOST EXTRAORDINARY.
I'M QUITE SURE THE UMPIRE'S
GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS.
OXFORD,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YOU MEAN YOU'VE ACTUALLY
COME HERE TO OFFER US MONEY
TO INTERFERE WITH THE RACE?
YES,
THAT'S RIGHT.
[ Knocking ]
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE.
YOU HAVE THE WRONG MEN.
[ Overlapping Chatter ]
BUT YOU MUST
LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.
YOU SHOULD REALIZE, SIR,
THAT OXFORD MEN CANNOT
BE BOUGHT.
HEAR! HEAR!
MM.
BUT, YOU SEE, WE THOUGHT THAT
IF THE SUM WAS LARGE ENOUGH,
AS LARGE AS THAT.
- NOW, GET A MOVE ON, PLEASE!
- [ Announcer ]
AND HERE'S OXFORD AT LAST.
WELL, I MAKE THEM ABOUT--
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LATE.
THAT'S BETTER.
I THINK IT IS THE FIRST TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF THE RACE THAT
ANY CREW HAS BEEN LATE.
GET READY!
ARE YOU READY?
- ROW!
- AND NOW THEY'RE OFF.
THEY'RE OFF TO A GOOD START.
THEY'RE LATE,
BUT NEVERTHELESS UNDERWAY,
AND DESPITE A RATHER FRESH
HEAD WIND, THEY'RE MOVING ALONG
RATHER NICELY.
CAMBRIDGE HAVE SETTLED DOWN
NICELY. MOVING ALONG TIDILY,
SIR JOHN.
AH, YES.
SPLENDID. SPLENDID.
THE BEST I'VE SEEN SINCE
I STROKED THEM IN '28.
OH?
YES. BEFORE YOUR TIME,
OF COURSE.
OH, OF COURSE.
YES, OF COURSE,
YES.
[ Chuckles ]
NOW, BOTH CREWS ARE ROWING
WITH ALMOST PERFECT STYLE
AND LOTS OF POLISH.
BUT NOW AS I LOOK, CAMBRIDGE
ARE PUTTING UP THE STROKE NOW.
AND AS THEY SHOOT
HAMMERSMITH BRIDGE,
I MAKE CAMBRIDGE ABOUT--
OH, I SHOULD SAY--
A GOOD LENGTH AHEAD.
THE LIGHT BLUES
ARE PUTTING UP
THE STROKE A BIT, SON.
THEY'RE GIVING IT TEN.
MM, YOU MIGHT
BE RIGHT, DAD.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT"?
THEY ARE GIVING OUT TEN.
YES. YES. YOU AND I KNOW
THEY'RE GIVING OUT TEN, JOHN.
I WAS POINTING IT OUT TO HIM.
HE'S NEW
TO THE GAME.
OH, I SEE.
WHY, IS HE ENTITLED
TO THAT CAP?
I MEAN TO SAY,
WHY IS HE WEARING IT?
TO KEEP ME HEAD WARM.
OH.
[ Chuckles ]
"KEEP IT WARM."
YES.
[ Announcer ]
NOW, AT ABOUT HALF WAY
ALONG THE COURSE,
CAMBRIDGE ARE STILL IN THE LEAD,
AND WE'LL JUST SEE HOW OXFORD
WILL RESPOND TO THIS CHALLENGE.
NOW, WITH THESE LADS, IT ISN'T
WIN OR LOSE OR DRAW THAT COUNTS.
IT'S SIMPLY PLAYING THE GAME.
THAT'S HOW
IT'S BEEN FOR 140 YEARS
OVER THIS BOAT RACE,
AND THAT'S HOW IT IS TODAY
ON THE THAMES HERE.
AND--
GOOD, GOD!
WHAT ON EARTH'S GOING ON,
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE?
- [ Announcer ] THE BLOODY SWINE
HAVE CUT THEIR RUDDER LINE.
- OXFORD!
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR WATER!
- IT LOOKS LIKE A CHANGE
IN TACTICS FOR THE DARK BLUES.
HOLD ON, SON. LET'S NOT
JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.
- THEY'RE GONNA
RAM 'EM AMIDSHIP!
- GOOD GOD!
- THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICIN'.
- YES. WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF IT, JOHN?
WELL, IT WOULD'VE NEVER
HAVE HAPPENED IN MY DAY.
NOR MINE.
- WELL, IT'S HAPPENIN' IN MINE!
- [ Guy ]
IT SEEMS THE LIGHT BLUES...
HAVE LOST THEIR ALL TOO HASTILY
ACQUIRED POLISH, EH, SON?
[ Announcer ]
AND NOW THE DARK BLUES
ARE TURNING BACK.
GOOD LADS.
THEY'RE GOING BACK
TO LEND A HAND.
[ Youngman ]
LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF A PUNCH UP.
- THIS LEAVES A VERY NASTY
TASTE IN THE MOUTH. [ Coughs ]
- YES, INDEED.
COME HERE, JOHN.
ANYTHING THAT LEAVES A NASTY
TASTE IN THE MOUTH DISGRACES.
[ Coughing ]
WHAT? JOHN. COULD YOU JUST--
FOR A QUICK PHOTO TOGETHER.
THANK YOU. IT'S A DISGRACE.
THE WHOLE THING IS A DISGRACE.
BLOODY STUDENTS!
WHAT'S GOING
ON THERE, UMPIRE?
INFRINGEMENT!
YES, UMPIRE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT IS IT?
[ Indistinct Shouting ]
HELLO, THIS IS MICHAEL ASPEL,
AND WELCOME ONCE AGAIN TO...

ANOTHER EDITION OF
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

...IS THIS FANTASTIC NEW
DREAM SHIP, THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN.
NOW LET'S MEET THE MAN
WHO'S GOING TO BE AT THE HELM
FOR HER MAIDEN VOYAGE,

GOOD AFTERNOON, CAPTAIN.
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
SIT YOURSELF DOWN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
UH-HUH.
NOW, CAPTAIN, YOU'RE NO STRANGER
TO A DISTINGUISHED COMMAND,
BUT HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
SELECTED FOR WHAT MUST BE...
THE MOST COVETED CAPTAINCY
IN THE HISTORY OF SEAMANSHIP?
[ Laughs ]
QUITE AN HONOR, I THINK
I'D SAY. AN HONOR, YES.
- [ All Blowing ]
- [ TV Program Audio Continues ]
SHE'S A MARVELOUS SHIP, SIR.
SO, HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP?
AFTER 35 YEARS OF SERVICE
TO QUEEN AND SEA,
I'VE NEVER LOOKED FORWARD
SO EAGERLY TO A NEW COMMAND.
HOW'S THAT?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
CAPTAIN KLAUS.
AND CAPTAIN KLAUS
IS NOT ALONE
IN HIS FEELINGS,
BECAUSE TONIGHT
MANY PEOPLE
ARE THINKING ABOUT...
THE MAIDEN VOYAGE
OF THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN.
AND, AS WELL,
ABOUT THE LUCKY PEOPLE...
WHO ARE GOING
TO BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO BE PASSENGERS.
ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE,
THE SO-CALLED GRACIOUS FEW...
WILL HAVE TO DIG
INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS
TO THE EXTENT...
OF ABOUT £5,000 EACH.
BUT CERTAINLY AMONGST
THESE BEAUTIFUL, TRENDY PEOPLE,
IT WOULD SEEM
THE ONLY "IN" PLACE
TO BE THIS EASTER...
IS ON BOARD
THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN.
GOOD EVENING.
THIS IS ALAN WHICKER
AT TOWER BRIDGE QUAY IN LONDON,
FROM WHERE
THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN,
THE MOST LUXURIOUS SHIP
EVER TO SAIL FROM THIS PORT,
