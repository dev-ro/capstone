Once upon a time, in the land of bossa nova,
lived a girl named Isabella.
When she was born, the gods blessed her
with extraordinary beauty,
but overlooked one itty-bitty flaw:
Motion sickness.
Her parents tried everything.
Conventional medicine, organized religion,
alternative religion.
Nothing worked...
until Yemanja,
goddess of the sea, took pity on the child
and compensated her with a gift.
Too frail to play with her friends,
Isabella spent her days
in the kitchen with the family cook.
She blossomed into a shy but dazzling girl,
who could melt the palates
and the hearts of men.
Isabella dreamed of traveling the world
and becoming a famous chef.
But when she laid eyes on the dashing
Toninho, all of her dreams took flight.
It was love... at first bite.
They fell so madly in love that they knew
nothing could ever keep them apart.
With Isabella's exotic dishes, Toninho's
new restaurant was the hottest spot in Brazil.
She did all the work.
He got all the credit.
And though she got job offers
from all over the planet,
Isabella's dreams of worldwide glory would
melt away in Toninho's irresistible embrace.
Now, Isabella could control her motion
sickness only by controlling her motions.
If she always drove,
if she always led,
if she always stayed on top,
everything was just fine.
But some men must always appear to be men,
no matter what it may cost.
Isabella!
Isabella! I'm a man!
I have to be on top sometimes!
Give me the strength, Yemanja.
Please give me the strength to leave him.
And Bahia!
Her prayers were answered.
And thus begins our story of love,
motion sickness
and the art of cooking.
Isabella!
Isabella!
Isabella!
Your attention, please.
Varig announces the arrival of
flight number 732 from Rio de Janeiro.
- Please, I beg you.
- There is no way I'm gonna do that.
Oh, mon, lady! What planet you from?
Brazil.
Hello.
Hi. I am Isabella.
Monica Jones is expecting me.
Ah, yes. Of course.
Unfortunately, Ms Monica has been detained.
Detained? What do you mean, detained?
Oh, nothing serious. For her, I mean.
She'll be back in a couple of days.
She's left you a key.
Thank you.
Have you known Ms Monica long?
Yes, since we were children, but she left.
- Bahia has never been the same without her.
- I don't doubt it.
I can't take elevators. I'll walk.
All right.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yemanja, goddess of the sea,
she fills our nets with fish every day.
Accept our offerings.
- Have you seen Isabella?
- No, not since last night.
- Is something wrong?
- Serafina, where is Isabella?
Go away!
Hey, hey! Wait, wait!
You are the son of a fisherman.
You must make Yemanja an offering.
She always gives you the best fish. Come on.
You can go to hell, Yemanja!
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Oliveira.
- May I get you a taxi?
- I can't take taxis.
- Thanks.
- Of course not.
Sorry. He's no longer the manager.
Do you have any openings in the kitchen?
- Washing dishes?
- No. I'm a chef.
Of course you are, my dear.
And I'm Jeanne Moreau.
I do wonderful codfish balls,
and I am known for my coconut-basted
lobster with passionfruit dip.
- Do you do fish and chips?
- Sorry?
Fish and chips. It's our most
popular special, Thursday nights.
Yes, I can make fish and chips.
Maybe in a spicy batter...
We're fully staffed.
- Or plain batter.
- Really fully staffed.
Shit!
Monsieur Laroche?
- I'm Isabella. Isabella Oliveira.
- And?
I was the chef at Yemanja in Bahia.
Remember?
Oh, Brazil. I remember.
- But you, I'm afraid...
- You gave me your card.
You spoke of a possibility
of a teaching position.
Oh, I can't really hire novices.
The spicy seafood soup.
Crustaceans marooned
in a most exquisite fragrant broth,
laced with fiery chilies.
Passion food. Food of the gods.
But it's too late.
The semester has already started.
Perhaps next year?
Hyperventilation. The soufflé fell... again!
It's a class for the "public général."
A two-week course.
I'm sure you wouldn't be interested.
Are you?
What happened? Where are the fish?
You shouldn't curse Yemanja!
Good morning. I am Isabella Oliveira,
and I am your new teacher.
I come from a place called Bahia
in the northeast of Brazil.
There we have a very unique way of cooking.
So I will not give you my recipes.
I will show you what inspires me in the hope
that you will find your own inspiration. OK?
I think that to cook well, you must bring
all your feelings and experience
to the act of creation.
Let's start with my passion:
Chili peppers.
They're from the Americas, and were found
here long before the arrival of Columbus.
Hold them in your hand. Notice the colors.
Now sniff.
OK, what do you smell?
Can you describe the sensation?
How about you?
I smell...
a walk on a moonlit beach in Acapulco.
When did you become a poet?
What do you expect me to say?
It smells like a vegetable?
So now here's my favorite.
"Malagueta" pepper.
Don't be fooled by its tiny size.
On the heat scale it is a very hot ten.
But what I love most about it is its smell.
Its aroma.
And a flavor you can never forget.
So when you work with the chilies,
remember to coat your fingers with oil,
so your skin won't burn.
The smooth flavor of a chili
is found on the outside part.
The part that burns are the ribs and seeds.
That's where the fire comes from.
I'm sorry.
I'll be fine. Really. I'll be fine.
We wrap tonight's broadcast
with thoughts from author Claudia Hunter,
whose new book, "Women Who Love
Men They Hate," has just hit the shelves.
Women in love with rotten guys.
Are you one of them?
Do you love someone
who emotionally jerks you around?
Are you hooked on a handsome,
charming, strutting peacock,
who makes wonderful love, but keeps you
hidden away in a small dark kitchen?
Shut up.
Go home! Go home! Christ.
We have no fish, no customers, no chef.
Help yourself to whatever's left in the kitchen.
Thanks, Mr Toninho.
Hey, come on, man. Don't be like that.
Ave Maria! Look at the painting!
All of our fish, there they are.
- You're drunk.
- Still, there they are!
Toninho, the fishermen
are very angry. It's a sign.
You must make a formal apology to Yemanja.
What she gives, she takes back.
You could lose the restaurant.
She didn't give me the restaurant.
I made it with my own hands, every inch of it!
This is my life. This and Isabella.
And no one is taking it away from me.
Toninho, what on earth
possessed you to do what you did?
I mean, when a man truly loves his wife,
he never lets her catch him.
- It's insensitive.
- And not so smart.
You're my friends.
Why are you making me feel worse?
I do miss Isabella's coconut shrimp.
And her delicious sweet "punhetinhas."
Yemanja, bring her back to me.
Give me a sign, a clue, a phone number.
Do something, or I'II...
Sign here.
- Izzy!
- Monica!
- Free at last!
- I missed you.
Thank Estée Lauder, I'm free at last!
- She wasn't even pretty.
- Are you sure?
I'm playing! Honey, he's a man.
They're not like us.
Faithful, romantic, selective.
They're like animals on
the Discovery Channel: Fuck, fuck!
- That's disgusting.
- I know.
So what did you do? Why were you in jail?
- Nikos didn't tell you?
- No.
Remember Dominic? He told me he wanted
a real woman that could give him a family.
So I doctored his goodbye drink
and I moralized the dog!
I used his body as my canvas "au Dominic."
It's beautiful. In Bahia
they would have given you a medal.
I can't believe the son of a bitch
even pressed charges.
I missed you a lot.
- You broke my heart when you left Bahia.
- What about me? What about me?
It's not my fault. You were my best friend.
You know, the retard twins:
Little puking girl with boy in a dress.
But Daddy got called home
and it was "Bye-bye, Bahia."
The diva had to learn how to be all by herself.
I've never been alone.
One day I was a child in my parents' home,
the next, a wife in Toninho's.
Well, now, girlfriend,
you are gonna learn to be on your own.
But I'm so Ionely, I can't even
cook without thinking of Toninho.
Yesterday in class I smelt a "malagueta."
I nearly chopped my finger off.
Girlfriend, if you love him that much,
forgive him and go on back to Bahia.
To be locked in a kitchen, while
he flirts with woman after woman? No!
What I have with Toninho is not love.
It's a curse.
If I want to start a new life,
I have to get him out of my head,
out of my skin, him out of me!
OK. You serious about this curse stuff?
Yes.
He is haunting me.
Then there's only one thing we can do.
Isabella, what took you so long?
- Hello.
- I can help you, child, but I warn you,
there is no lookin' back.
Yemanja will take your love to the bottom of
the sea and you'll never love Toninho again.
- Are you prepared for that?
- Are you prepared for that?
Yes.
OK. This is what you must do.
Find four fat Mephistophelean crabs,
the heart of an artichoke,
two ripe female mangoes,
12 drops of midnight rain...
The feather of a black rooster.
The eyes of two boiled catfish.
And finally, sprinkle the ashes
of his burnt photograph.
Allow me.
How about this? "What's My Orientation?"
Every day we bring out guests,
and a panel has to guess
if they're gay or straight.
- I wouldn't watch that.
- Me neither.
Dammit, Cliff. Just find me a 7:30 show
that won't get clobbered by "Xena."
- I will find you something, Alex, I promise.
- Yeah, well, you better!
Thank y...
God, I hate my life.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Good morning.
Thank you.
Good morning. I am Isabella Oliveira.
Welcome to my class.
I see a lot of new faces here today.
Oh Lord! Are you nuts? You're crazy!
My friend, can you take me here?
Oh Christ.
- There's no address, mon.
- I know. Will that be a problem?
Now crush the garlic in the mortar with
a pinch of salt. Measure with your senses.
In time your fingers can develop
a tactile memory forjust the right amount.
You've got to ring more doorbells than the
Avon lady to find something by this method.
Sauté the bell peppers, onions,
tomatoes and chilies in "dendê" oil.
Then we add the stock.
And when it comes to a boil, add the shrimp.
You will see that they are ready
when they turn pink and begin to curl.
Isn't that beautiful?
To finish, pour into a nice serving dish
and sprinkle a little more cilantro.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Voilà! Muqueca de camarão.
And remember: The last
and most important ingredient
is to share it with someone you love.
I think it always improves
the flavor of the dish.
Well, that's all. Thank you.
- Too hot for you?
- No.
No...
It's just... new.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
If you called every Monica Jones in the book,
you must have unlisted number.
But she's quite unique.
5'10", braids, great legs and she's a man.
In San Francisco, that is not unique.
Until two hours ago my entire definition
of cooking was "Remove tinfoil and nuke."
I have never seen anything like it!
The whole room was bedazzled by you.
- Where did you learn that?
- I was a chef in my husband's restaurant.
- Is that too heavy?
- No, it's fine. It's fine.
But, anyway, I left him.
Your husband?
That's great! I mean, why?
Let's say he was stifling me.
How could he? How could anyone stifle you?
You are so... like the air,
like the wind, like a fish.
No... Not like a fi...
- Come here. I wanna tell you my idea.
- I can't.
- It's OK.
- I can't, really.
Come on, it's OK. You'll be fine.
Are you all right?
- I get motion sickness.
- That's nothing. When I get anxious, I hiccup.
Hold on.
Yeah? Hey, Alex. I did it!
I got an idea. We are coming right over.
You are gonna love it.
OK, what do you think? A cooking show.
Just like the class. Your recipes, your style,
everything just the way you want it.
How does that make you feel?
- A cooking show at "7":30?
- Your wife. She has the travel agent on hold.
- Why not? Everybody's making dinner.
- They're not! Everybody's eating dinner.
- Nobody wants to watch a cooking show.
- Alex, just... just wait one sec.
Alex, this is Chef Isabella Oliveira.
Isabella, this is our station manager, Alex.
Hello.
Hi.
A TV show!
Holy Mary and Rhoda!
- So who's coughing?
- My producer.
Cliff Lloyd, Monica.
Hi.
It's quite a nice place you got here, Monica.
It's very... artistic.
Amazing how you make that
sound like an insult.
Excuse me.
- I'm makin' him nervous.
- No, not at all.
So, Cliff, what's the show gonna be like?
Exactly as Isabella wants it.
How sweet.
You sure he's a producer?
- Excuse me?
- Yeah?
- Why does everything have to be so bright?
- It's TV.
I know it's TV.
But how would it look if we
turned off this? And this and this?
I don't know. Give it a try.
Looks good to me.
That's it for us. Stay tuned for the premiere
of our new feature: "Passion Food Live."
That's coming up next.
- And we're out.
- OK. Thanks, everybody. Great show.
- Let's get dinner.
- I've a tanning that you're making me late for!
- I said we're over.
- What?
- We are done! You're dumped!
- What? I can't believe this!
- You are a blithering idiot.
- I am not a blithering idiot! I'm an author!
- She looks great.
- Yeah. Let's just keep moving here.
Yemanja, I am preparing
your favorite dish tonight.
Please don't let me down.
Wow. I've really gotta start
wearing my hair down.
OK! In five,
four, three...
Good evening. I am Isabella Oliveira,
and this is "Passion Food."
In this show you will learn to turn simple
ingredients into sensual, delicious dishes
that fire the blood and satisfy the heart.
- My God, the camera loves her.
- It's like a miracle.
I would like to introduce
my assistant, Monica.
- Hi!
- What is that?
L- l-l-I have no...
Play "Cinzas," the breaker of hearts.
This is always happening.
That's it. Don't stop. It's good for your arms.
Coconut milk is the main ingredient
in Bahian cuisine.
Hard to extract,
but worth every drop of sweat.
So now ladle some hot water over it,
and squeeze.
Squeeze.
Squeeze.
And now we are going to reduce the heat to
bring all the flavors and the scent of the sea.
While it simmers, we are going
to cut the tomatoes in quarters.
Make sure your tomatoes are full and plump.
- She's a natural.
- They should be firm as well. Ripe, but firm.
Soak the French bread in the coconut milk.
Break the crust so that
the milk can penetrate its center...
- A whisky, please.
- Comin' right up.
Hey, man.
- Work it with your fingers till...
- Isabella!
- That's my wife!
- Hey!
- That's my wife!
- D'you work her with your fingers?
Bake until it forms a golden crust.
I think that it will taste even better
if you share it with someone you love.
And we're out.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to make a toast.
To our cast and crew for
an unbelievably successful first show.
And, of course, to Brazil's own gift to us,
the extraordinary Isabella!
- Hear, hear! Bravo.
- Whatever.
You're gonna change my life.
Hey, taxi! Stop! Stop!
How could she? Squeezing her coconuts
for all the world to see.
Your girlfriend's a stripper, mon?
Mine, too. You get used to it.
There she is! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Isabella!
- Oh, my God.
- Toninho!
- Yemanja be praised.
I need to speak to you... alone.
Izzy, I'll be right here.
- What happened to your face?
- What happened?
- I was defending your honor!
- My honor doesn't need defending.
Oh, no? I travel half the planet
searching for the Isabella I know and love.
And I find you on TV looking so...
You're looking...
You look beautiful.
Like when we first met
and I made you my wife.
Your skin tasted of salt,
and your hair held a scent of cinnamon.
And when you kissed me,
your lips burned with chili pepper.
It made my head spin.
Now here you are.
Come home with me where you belong.
I belong where I choose to be.
And I choose to be here.
Do you also choose to dress like this?
It's not proper, not in your condition.
- What condition is that?
- Married to me.
Funny. You don't act married.
For three years I've been lying
flat on my back for you. Three years!
Not to mention that
I never get to drive anywhere!
You know, I'm not some thing
that can be moved around like a puppet.
Fine. From now on
you can move wherever you like.
Isabella, I swear on my mother's grave,
you are the only woman I ever loved.
Your mother is still alive.
That's not the point. You can't leave me.
You're my wife.
Goodbye, Toninho.
On your mother's grave?
Honey, please!
Mon, dis not gonna be so easy.
Isabella? Are you there?
Madame Oliveira! Alberto.
- You remember me?
- Of course. Your show is the talk of the town.
It's an honor
to have you here in my restaurant.
- But not in your kitchen.
- Excuse me?
Jeanne Moreau.
- Jeanne Moreau?
- It will come back to you.
Certainly, madame.
- So what was that all about?
- Nothing.
- I'm being bad.
- You, bad?
That's hard for me to imagine.
Thank you.
You don't have to buy me flowers.
This is not a date.
- Is it?
- You thought it was a business dinner?
Yes.
Oh, well... no.
No?
I'm sorry.
I had a great time with you, and you have
been wonderful to me, but... I'm not ready yet.
Someday, maybe?
Someday.
