Let the turban race begin!
Can't I pray wearing my
American hat, brother?
In India, one wears a
turban while praying.
Damn it!
You don't know anything!
Sister-in-law, get him a wife who'll
tie his turban and his pajama string.
What a fuss!
They're being so childish.
It's a festival; they have every
right to enjoy themselves today.
And I don't think it's
right to be so strict.
I'm not being strict,
I'm talking about discipline.
- That should apply to you too.
- What do you mean?
It's Diwali today, and you're
going to attend the music concert.
Once you start singing,
people won't let you stop.
Is the turban okay?
Whenever you tie my turban,
my every note sounds melodious.
Honestly, if I didn't have you,
I'd have been a very bad singer.
You're lying.
- Come home soon today.
- Why?
Your student is going to
arrive from Italy today.
If he speaks Italian,
how will we speak with him?
No, he can speak many languages.
He speaks very good Hindi.
He's half-Indian.
I had asked Nandini to vacate
her room for him, did she do it?
I did tell her, but it made her
so angry that she left in a huff.
- Why should that make her angry?
- Ask her.
I'll call her here.
You convince her.
"Like a line drawn
in the soil...."
"God has created
something"
"It took a mixture of
fire, air and water..."
"to make a picture
so perfect"
"You laugh with such
gay abandon"
"You are a wonder of nature"
"You win hearts;
the sight of you..."
sets off storms
and lightning"
"You are incomparable,
O fair virgin..."
"In you is all nature.
In you, it is"
"You are made of clay, no doubt.
But innocence-personified are you"
"You're simplicity
and innocence..."
"keeps you going"
"Like the breeze,
you waft..."
"like the waters,
you flow"
"Like a stream,
you flow"
"The confluence of waters
is your beauty"
"Like a raging fire..."
"is your passionate youth"
"Swaying as you walk..."
"you speed up
and turn around..."
"kissing the soil..."
"You are mischievous"
"Like the wild spring;
the gay dance..."
"You have piercing eyes"
"You have all the airs"
Where were you?
- Still angry?
- Father was inquiring about you.
- I'd gone to buy the lantern.
But where will you hang it,
you have to vacate your room.
Come what may,
I will not vacate my room.
I decorate my room so
lovingly every Diwali...
not for a stranger to occupy it.
I'll never tolerate that!
But why are you all after my room?
Because the mansion's best
room has been given to you.
But don't worry, we'll all
help you vacate it. Won't we?
And then, there is nothing
in your room...
...except the yellow flowers,
the lamp chandelier you like...
...and your little diary.
If you all tease me,
I'll spoil this Rangoli.
Where were you, dear. You know
I don't leave without seeing you.
Answer me.
Oh! You are a statue?
But you can indicate
with your eyes.
Did you vacate the room?
You're still angry.
Look, dear. He's our guest,
and we must honor a guest.
Vacate the room before
I get back, all right?
That's a pretty lantern.
Let's go, Bhairon.
Just let him come! I'll make him so
miserable, he'll leave in two days.
I will go to the mansion, father!
I haven't left mother,
I'll never leave her.
You love being up there,
don't you? Stay up!
Oh no, I don't need your help,
I'll find my own way.
This way.
But where?
No, I don't need your help,
I'll ask these sands the way.
You're laughing? You're enjoying
troubling your son, aren't you?
But get this clear, I'll go to
the mansion, I'll learn music...
...I'll live in India, and
I'll call mother here from Italy.
You slapped me?
It's the first time you've
slapped me, but I'll still go.
Why shouldn't I?
Who's over there?
O Italian, may you forget your
way before you reach my room.
May you be robbed, may you lose
your way, may you go hungry!
May the hot sands...
He fell in the water!
Welcome! What an entry!
From Italy into the water!
How are you?
Let me introduce everybody.
My younger brother, Nilesh.
My wife, Pushpa.
- Hello!
This is Parul.
This is my brother, Tarun,
who has returned from America.
And I'm Kamlesh.
The cheek he has!
He pulled everyone in the water.
Oh no, he's so jovial,
he's made everybody laugh.
That's only for now. He'll make
everyone cry when he leaves.
And I'm Bhairon.
What have you done!
You pushed the guest in the water?
Pardon them, this is not
how we welcome a guest.
Come, the food is ready.
I'll take you to your room.
He's a jovial guy,
we'll get along very well.
A few days with us and
he'll have adopted our ways.
What was the need
to invite him here?
There are so many young girls in the
house, what if he woos one of them?
Aunt, can't you say anything
good about anybody?
Who is she, Vithal?
- She's the mistress of the house.
She rules the roost,
but she's very kind hearted.
Welcome! You've arrived on a very
auspicious day, it's Diwali today.
How was the journey?
Did you come swimming?
No, I fell in the water.
Vithal, show him to his room,
and get the breakfast ready.
I'll just be back from the temple.
- Yes, ma'am.
Auntie, can I say something?
Even my husband says so.
Where is my room?
What did you say?
Just you wait!
The Italian is here!
Hi! How are you?
I think you're upset.
I'm Sameer, you can call me Sam.
What's your name?
Can I call you Nandu?
- Only Nandini!
Your name is different.
Does it mean Nandi, the bull?
It's not necessary for every name
to have a meaning.
It's not necessary for you to look
at me while lighting every candle.
First you look away.
- How can I, your eyes hold me.
Why should they?
- You'll burn your hands.
See! The effect of an evil eye.
- You must have cast an evil eye.
I don't have evil eyes.
- Then what eyes do you have?
Sharp, very sharp eyes,
they can see your soul.
And what do they say?
- The tangy lemon!
The tangy lemon?
So sweet!
Shift your gaze or you'll
loosen your grip on the rope.
Never mind.
- The chandelier will fall.
Let it.
- The glass will break.
Let it.
- If it breaks, you will blink.
Let's see who blinks first.
If you keep looking at me,
you'll fall in love with me.
Listen!
You have, haven't you?
What are you all gossiping about?
He's stripping!
Come on, get in.
- Wait!
Will you just keep laughing
or tell me about it too?
It's nothing grandma, they've
been laughing at the Italian.
What does he look like?
- Tell her.
"A guest we have at home
who talks so very sweetly"
"A handsome young man who
rents mischief in the air"
"A great face,
he's innocent looking"
"he wins over your heart"
"A body like marble,
he's everyone's favorite"
"He's so very bitter
and cunning"
"He stole my bed, my room,
everything that belonged to me"
"I'm sure I'll give him
the treatment too"
"Listen to me...
I haven't been able to understand"
"Which bird are you
talking about?"
"Beware, you're young; lest he casts
a shadow on you"
"Don't get close to him; he'll touch
you and you'll be afflicted"
"You will neither eat nor sleep;
you will suffer heartburn"
"When he takes to his wings,
the world will laugh at you"
You've come even here?!
I heard you laughing,
so I came over.
This is a house, not a garden
that you can walk in anywhere.
Come, I'll show you.
Grandma, I'm Sameer. I have
come from Italy. How are you?
Sameer! A whiff of cool breeze.
Call him a snowstorm grandma.
He'll leave everybody cold.
Come!
You are just what I'd thought
you'd be. You have no manners.
You bathe in the open! You see
girls and walk into their room!
If you want to live here, you'll have
to follow the rules of this house
Or you'll be thrown out.
Why do you get so
annoyed, Mandakini?
I'm not Mandakini, I'm Nandini.
You've been a pain since you've come.
You've taken away my room, now you're
wooing everybody with your sweet talk.
By tomorrow,
you'll become father's pet.
Have you come here from Italy
to learn music or to have fun?
You call yourself a singer?
You look like a muscleman to me.
Here's your room.
Oh damn it! What a mess.
This guy is too much!
When will this guy go back?!
What are you doing in my room?
- This is my room, you idiot!
This is now my room and I'll
roam around as I please in it.
I'd come to take my diary, you...
- Don't look, I'm still in my towel.
May you get lost in the desert
before you reach my room.
Don't you dare read my diary!
How can you read someone's diary?
What a mess you've made of the room.
Don't you think this room
looks more alive now.
Master has called the guest.
The master has called?
- Go quickly!
Have you come here to bathe or
to eat? Go wear your clothes.
He came in his towel.
He went in his towel,
he'll get a good hiding!
It's good my towel
didn't come lose.
Listen!
- I went in my towel
We tried to stop you,
but you didn't hear us.
Doesn't matter. Now, to please
father, greet him in a special way.
Special way?
- Show him how.
Got it?
- Yes...
but she isn't fooling me, is she?
- Not at all...
how can she do that to a guest.
Go, hurry!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
I'm greeting you, sir.
- Like this? Who taught you this?
Go and sit on that chair.
Wait! Let him sing first.
- Let him eat, he must be hungry.
No, let me judge him right now.
He kept writing to me, he's come
from Italy to learn music.
I want to hear him to know whether
he deserves to learn it at all.
Sing!
That was wonderful!
You are not only a good singer
but seem to be a good man too.
While teaching you, maybe even
I learn something from you.
Shall I teach you now, sir?
Not now, let's have breakfast now.
Music means everything to me.
Music is great, like God.
To be a great singer, it is very
necessary to have a pure mind.
It is said that a fake
singer sings superficially...
...a hungry man sings
to fill his stomach...
...but a true singer
sings from the heart.
You sing from the heart,
that's why I'm going to teach you.
Sir, your fees?
- My music is not for sale.
But I may take something when
the time comes, or I may not.
My father will be
very pleased today.
I won't be able to eat anymore.
Until you don't burp 3-4 times like
this, you haven't eaten anything.
You are young,
you should eat more.
You'll have to eat what I've made
or I'll be offended.
You haven't eaten any dhokla,
you must have some.
And these Kachoris.
- And something sweet too.
All that lentil-stuff...
I can't digest it.
You'll keep this between us,
won't you? Please!
Grandma was right,
Sameer, a whiff of air!
Why are you after me?
Have some sense of timing at least.
You embarrassed me before her.
Thinking about me, aren't you?
- Yes.
No.
You're lying. You are
thinking about me, I know.
Why should I think about you?
Then who were you thinking about?
About myself.
- It's one and the same thing.
Don't assume things,
you'll be heartbroken.
Then what are you doing
on the terrace at night?
I come here very often.
When father practices at night,
the stars and I listen to him.
Grandma says these stars
change our destiny.
But they are very dear to me.
What if your dear ones
go against you?
Then I'll fight with them. They'll
have to give me the destiny I want.
Do you believe in destiny?
- Believe? I can even read destiny.
Really? Then read mine.
It's Indians who read destiny in
hands, we Italians read the feet.
Really? Then read my feet.
Let me first tell you
that you have beautiful feet.
Read!
And your feet will very soon...
Feeling ticklish, aren't you?
They'll very soon take you across
seven seas for the sake of love.
Where?
Madras...
Calcutta, Bihar...
London...
Italy!
Stupid!
Look, a falling star!
Did you wish for something?
No.
- Why?
My mother says you should not wish
on a falling star, it's inauspicious.
You miss your mother very much,
don't you?
Yes. She's so far away.
And your father?
- He's very close to me.
And...
- And your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Listen! Will you be my friend?
Women cannot compete with men.
- Both are equals.
Even a simple walk down the
stairs is a task for you.
What happened?
Tell them how men are
superior to women.
Of course they are!
Oh! You too. Tell us what men
can do that we women cannot.
There are many, but let me
give you just one example.
Can you do this?
Only women are permitted here.
What are you doing here?
Music drew me here.
- Can you see any other man here?
Vithal is here.
That's different.
Vithal has reared us.
If the women see you here,
they'll beat you to pulp. Go!
Do you have songs
for every occasion?
Yes, every occasion.
Wedding songs, harvest songs,
love songs, spring songs, Bhavai...
Havai?
- No, Bhavai.
Haven't you heard of that?
I'll sing it.
"I'm a tall young man.
I wear a turban"
"I sport big whiskers,
like every colorful Gujarati"
"I'm a colorful Gujarati"
And the one in which you clap?
Garba!
- Yes.
"Apply henna on her hands..."
And?
- Bhangra.
You are making fun of me!
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.
Sister!
- Some other time.
Sister, they are calling you.
I'm coming.
- Come soon!
Only my voice?
And?
- Your hair.
And?
- Your smile.
And?
Your style of saying,
'falling star'.
And?
Nandini!
- Coming!
Go on, hurry!
- Your mummy, your daddy.
Coming!
- Your cook, your sweets, flowers.
You are an absolute nut!
I didn't say it!
Why are you laughing, even you
don't know. Shall I tell you?
The groom has arrived,
you aren't dressed yet?
Go get dressed, and see if
Anu is ready or not, hurry!
Yes, mother.
You're okay.
- Excuse me!
I look better than you right now.
Take a look at me after I get
dressed, you'll be stunned.
The way she boasts, it'd appear
she's the Miss World.
Anu, are you ready?
The groom has arrived.
Shall I come in to help you?
No, just give me a minute.
You'll have to come with me,
I cannot live without you.
Do you know how I spent
these six months?
I suffocated within,
but kept a smile on my lips.
But you simply went away.
Only to make myself
good enough for you.
Coming, Nandini.
Let's run away.
- You're saying that now?
My parents will die of shame.
It's too late now. Go!
What happened?
- I broke a vase.
Are you all right?
- Yes.
We'll definitely meet one day.
Coming, Nandini.
Thank God you opened the door.
What were you doing for so long?
How do I look?
It'd obviously take time; I'm being
a bride for the first time.
Scared?
- A little.
I'm so happy for you.
- Get dressed, I'll go meet grandma.
I'll go take care of the guests.
Fix it properly.
I'm Tarun.
You look beautiful.
"These trespasses of my eyes..."
"please do forgive"
"These trespasses of my eyes..."
"please do forgive"
"With my gaze fixed on you..."
"that which my lips
should say to you..."
"my eyes do"
"The modesty and shyness
my eyes observe..."
"please do forgive"
"They lower under your gaze"
"That which my eyes could
tell you when I looked at you..."
"I tell you,
with my eyes lowered"
"These intrusions of my eyes..."
"please do forgive"
"This kohl in your eyes,
I want on my lips"
"I want to save you from the
eyes of the Sun and Moon"
"Come, let me hide you
in my eyes"
"My flights of fancy..."
"do please forgive"
"Every moment,
I think of you"
"When everyone else
is in his senses..."
"your memories
take my senses away"
"The modesty and shyness
my eyes observe..."
"do please forgive"
"To you my life
shall always belong"
"Love for you,
my heart shall always have"
"To even breathe,
I shall forever need you"
"I'm naive at heart..."
"please do forgive me"
"My heart heeds not me"
"The dreams I have begun to dream..."
"my heart strings"
"The trespasses of my eyes..."
"please do forgive"
"My shyness and modesty..."
"please do forgive"
Aren't you ashamed to do that
in everyone's presence?
Nandini, listen...
I don't want to hear anything.
You've spoilt my photograph.
Why are you getting angry?
I was only joking.
You want to know what I wanted
to tell you yesterday?
You didn't tell me yesterday.
Sorry, I don't want to hear it now.
Let me tell you.
- Leave me, what are you doing?
Please cool down now.
There were so many people around...
what if someone had seen us?
The celebrations are about to begin,
don't be a spoilsport.
All right, tell me what you
wanted to, I'll listen.
I now want to say that you
are not worthy of my love.
Oh really?
Then stay in your room!
There may be someone at the wedding
who finds me suitable.
If he asks for my hand in marriage,
you'll be left helpless.
"The sour lime..."
"The sour lime..."
"Get me a sour lemon"
"The sour lime..."
"A little sour lemon..."
"Get me a sour lemon"
"Go and get it for me...
get it for me"
"Go the fields and
get me a sour lemon"
"A sour lemon..."
"A sour lemon..."
"Get me one..."
"One from the fields...
get me a sour lemon"
"Get me a sour lemon"
"If you wish to escape
the evil eye, listen to me"
"If you wish to escape
the evil eye, listen to me"
"slice a little sour lemon..."
"and see it work"
"The evil eye will
turn sour for itself"
"It will fall by the way"
"One from the fields...
get me a sour lemon"
"A sour lemon..."
"Get me a sour lemon"
"So tiny it is...
yet so juicy"
"Tangy and sour it is"
"It's smell tempts you..."
"it's so sour"
"In love, my beloved..."
"lovers end up casting
an eye on each other..."
"and there are often
lovers tiffs"
"But this is love for you"
"Get one for me, friends..."
"a little sour lemon"
"A sour lemon"
"A sour lemon"
You are too much, brother!
I wanted to introduce you to
Nandini, but you just disappeared.
I thought maybe...
I'd be tongue-tied before
such a beautiful girl.
Stupid! Some things are
even said with your eyes.
Come! You must meet her.
But listen!
- I don't want to hear anything.
What if she doesn't like me?
She will! So what if she's fair
and you are dark...
her eyes are blue
while yours are black...
she sings well, but you sing
terribly even in the bathroom.
But you have something
that no one in the world has.
What?
- A beautiful heart.
I have one more thing.
- What is that?
You are avoiding the issue.
Tell me, do you approve of
Nandini or not?
Yes.
- Then choose one hand.
Do it once again.
Whichever hand I chose,
Nandini will be mine!
Congratulations for the wedding.
- Stupid!
Anu's marriage is over,
Nandini is also a big girl now.
Have you given her a thought?
- What for?
I'll tell you.
Chose a hand.
How childish!
- Chose one!
Shall I?
I knew you'd choose this hand!
We've got a very good
proposal for Nandini.
Proposal for Nandini?
Yes, advocate
Vikramjeet's son, Vanraj.
The boy is good,
even the family is nice.
We are visiting their
city for the fair anyway.
We'll go to their house and accept
the proposal too. What do you...
A daughter has to go one day.
Does he sing?
Can't you think of anything else
other than singing? Yes, he sings.
Really?
- But he's pretty hoarse.
Meet Nandini, she ruined
the family photograph.
Everybody is looking straight,
but she is looking up.
Vithal, look at your photo.
- I'm not visible, only my hair is.
Kamini look, your groom, the priest.
Why do people eat pizzas in Italy?
Because food made by grandma
is not available there.
Sameer, you are a sweet talker.
- He is my sweet son.
What happened? Don't you like the
food? Nandini has cooked today.
It's a bit spicy.
Spicy food is for spicy girls,
not for sweet fools
That's a great reply!
What stupidity is this?
Stop it, Sameer!
Don't be stubborn.
Give him some water.
Why do you always trouble him?
Look, he has left.
What happened?
- Sameer ate a lot of chilies.
His mouth must be on fire,
give him some honey.
Go and apologize to him.
He ate the chilies, but he'll
have a problem in the morning.
A token of our love.
This hand has been punished
for the offense it committed.
It would be so nice if I was a
kite, I'd fly in the sky like it.
Girls are like kites.
Before marriage, their
parents control them.
After marriage, it's their husbands.
Like Anu got married,
and now, it's Nandini's turn.
Not so soon.
- Why are you being so modest?
You are desperate to get married,
why don't you say so openly?
Why are you so concerned,
I'll marry when I want to.
You'll marry of your own accord?
- Of course!
You act as is I don't know anything.
You're flying high these days.
Some are lucky to fly high...
while some don't even manage
to get off the ground, like you.
That's not the way to speak
to elders, Nandini! Apologize!
Apologize to her!
I'm sorry, sister.
- Doesn't matter, she's immature.
It's not that we are not
worried about her marriage.
We've got a good proposal too. If the
horoscopes match, we'll accept it.
Please don't mind her.
- Of course not.
The mother is looking
for a groom...
while the daughter's
having an affair!
Forget it.
"Let the kite loose..."
"and when it flies higher,
pull it closer"
"Let the kite loose..."
"It could cut your finger..."
"so what is a kite?"
"Let the kite loose..."
"And when it flies higher..."
"pull it closer"
"Your kite has gone flying"
"It flew so high
and it was cut"
"Be not disheartened;
try again"
"The skies are yours...
be brave"
"He can't hang on
to the string"
"He doesn't even know
how you tie a kite"
"Let there be another contest;
try your tricks again"
"The kite teaches you
to always aim high"
"That's what the kite
teaches you"
"Let the kite loose..."
"Let the kite loose..."
Here you are! I cut your father's
kite today. Do you know how?
I let my string go under your
father's kite and it fell down!
It would be so much fun
if you were also with me.
Our kites would sway up
in the skies.
I don't want these paper toys!
You fly the kite while
I hold the string?
Someone will take me away
right from under your nose...
and you'll do anything
Of course I will!
I'll beat him to pulp!
Do you know the taunts I have
to hear because of you?
You're always being childish,
always taking things lightly.
My family is talking about
getting me married.
People will come to see me
They'll ask me show them how
I walk, sit, sing, laugh.
And I'll have to do all that.
But you don't do anything!
Not even when my groom
takes me away.
Not even when I belong
to someone else.
Not when I get married,
not even when I die!
I'll tell your father.
You could not tell me,
how will you tell him?
You cannot even tell me.
It's a sin.
It's not a sin.
- What if something happens?
What will happen?
- A baby?
Babies don't happen like this.
- But this isn't right.
Father won't accept.
- Why won't he?
This isn't a sin, is it?
- No, it isn't.
You won't leave me?
- Never.
Someone is here.
Where are you going?
- I must go.
Aunt?
I came looking for a book,
I feel like reading today.
Which book?
- But what are you doing here?
Aren't you flying kites?
It's real fun.
I'd come to straighten things here
- First straighten your clothes.
Mind your own business, aunt.
Don't act smart with me. The day
I get tough, you'll be in trouble.
Found it! How's this book?
- It's in English.
So what, I'll have to
even learn Italian now.
Congratulations!
The horoscopes match.
Congratulations!
- To you too!
Do the horoscopes match?
- Yes, perfectly!
See! I told you.
Give sweets to everyone.
First let me give the one
who's getting married.
Look how shy he is.
- Wait!
You cannot become my son-in-law
just because the horoscopes match.
You're marrying a singer's daughter,
let me check if you can sing.
Sing for me.
- Sing?
Of course! You'll have to sing.
I have to take this test.
Go ahead and sing, my son.
Even we'll ask Nandini
to argue like a lawyer...
before the marriage takes place.
How about a song then?
"A spark the rains
extinguish..."
"but what the rains start a fire...
how douses it?"
Enough. You lack melody, but
my daughter will teach you that.
But there is a truthfulness
in your voice which assures me...
that you'll keep my daughter happy.
The sky is shining with lights.
It seems like thousands of lovers are
carrying lights in their hands, grandma.
Lovers don't need lights to shine.
- How do you know, grandma?
Love told me.
- Had you ever loved?
Love lures everybody,
nobody can escape it.
Did you have a love marriage?
- No, I married and then fell in love
Tell us about it.
I was barely 14 when I got married.
I was combing my hair one day...
and your grandpa
was flying a kite...
when your grandpa slipped
and fell from the terrace.
I ran towards him.
I saw him holding on to the parapet.
I extended my hand.
The moment he touched me,
a current ran through me.
Then?
Then our eyes met
and we fell in love.
That was the first time
he kissed me.
And you became pregnant?
- You don't get pregnant by kissing.
Then?
- Then we had a family.
We were very happy.
Then?
Then my children got married,
we had lots of celebrations.
Then?
- You all came along.
Then?
Then I sang lullabies for you all,
you laughed, you cried.
Then?
- Then nothing.
Then?
Then?
Then?
After 60 years, two lovers
met again on the same terrace.
And grandma caught them!
Your father always wanted
a singer husband for you.
Maybe that's your dream too. That's
why I want to tell you something.
Even I've been thinking of telling
you something since several days.
Shall I?
- Yes.
But you'll have to promise that you
won't get angry after you hear me.
Angry? Why?
- Actually...
Anu is back from her in-laws.
She's in a very bad state.
Come down quickly
Get this clear Anu,
you'll have to go back.
No father, come what may,
I'll not go back there.
You'll have to forget
about Bharat and go back.
I'd rather die, but I'll
never return to that house.
I don't want to spend my nights
like a corpse in that man's bed.
A daughter has to marry
as per her father's wishes.
After marriage, a husband
means everything to a woman...
that's the norm.
Anu will return after Holi.
No! Send her back right away.
Her sight makes me...
- Stop!
We don't hit grown up girls
in our family.
By Holi, things will cool down.
Anu will definitely return after that
She won't be happy there, father.
Look how they have beaten her.
Nandini, kids are not supposed
to interfere in elders matters.
It's her life, ask her.
Nandini, go away.
How can she live with
a man she doesn't love?
Nandini, leave!
Leave!
Sameer has arranged for everything,
Bharat must be waiting for you.
Come on, hurry!
- What is all this?
Am I doing the right thing?
The family reputation...
what if something happens to Bharat?
This is not the time to think about
that. You are doing the right thing.
This is your life, you have
a right to live it your way.
Is everything arranged?
- Yes.
Are you afraid?
I am afraid of your father.
Let's go.
Hurry, Bharat is
waiting outside the temple.
Idiot! There is no cat
in this house.
Anu must be so happy,
we did such a good thing for them.
This is all very romantic.
Even we must sprint and get married.
Sprint?
- I mean, elope.
Even before your family realizes,
we'll be in Italy.
But why should we elope? You'll have
to ask father for my hand in marriage.
Just think! We'll get
married in everyone's presence.
Where has Anu gone?
- I don't know anything.
You know everything.
Is that why we employed you?!
Tell me, or I'll kill you!
Bhairon! Why are you beating him?
Even you are responsible for this.
- What are you saying?
I'd told you to send Anu back
immediately, but you didn't listen.
I did the right thing.
- Right thing? Nonsense!
Anu ran away with another man.
Look, her wedding chain
and this letter.
She has scorned all
of us, especially you.
Lower your voice!
You are elder to us, so you cannot
tolerate anyone telling you anything.
What right do you have to
force your decisions on us?
You make mistakes
and we have to suffer.
It's your fault. You didn't teach
your kids the family norms...
...now you are misbehaving.
- I'm not misbehaving!
You'll understand how I feel when
Nandini runs away with someone.
Don't cross your limits!
He's right. Before blaming others,
take care of your own family.
You'll be ashamed the day you
know what your daughter is up to.
Stop it! Don't any of you dare
badmouth about Nandini.
I trust Nandini,
I take pride in her.
She's as pure as my music.
If I find her doing anything wrong,
assume my music will die forever.
I'll never sing after that.
- If you trust her so much...
call her here right away
and get things clarified.
She'll hear you only
if she's home.
Nandini, where are you?
Go out and see what
your daughter is up to.
In the first vow, we'll promise to
share all our happiness and sorrows.
In the second vow,
you'll promise to protect...
Iove, respect, and cherish me.
In the fourth vow, I'll take
your permission to go ahead...
so that when death arrives,
I can embrace it before you.
When death arrives,
we'll embrace it together.
We didn't expect this from you.
What have you done?
This has been happening for eight
months and we don't even know?!
You didn't even tell me?
I've begun to hate him!
I'd never thought he'd do this.
- People get obsessed in love.
I experience
the same obsession.
I just didn't realize
when I fell in love.
No one has the right to
fall in love in this house.
We live by certain norms.
People respect your father.
He was disgraced because
of you today, only you.
You didn't even...
Who knew a small meeting would
develop into such a deep relationship.
Sameer says father loves him,
I'm sure he'll accept.
He won't.
Your marriage with Vanraj has been
finalized. We've given them our word.
When I was explaining the
marriage rites to him...
it felt as if the whole
Universe was celebrating.
Marriage rites? How far
has your relationship gone?
Have you done anything
that could embarrass us?
Has he touched you?
Tell me!
Here... and here...
...here...
- Stop it, Nandini!
He has touched my soul.
His eyes follow me everywhere.
Don't separate us, I won't be
able to live without him.
I love him very much,
I can only belong to him.
Control yourself!
Help me, mother. Convince dad.
- Calm down! Listen to me!
I'll try to convince your father.
But until I return,
you will not budge from here.
I have quit singing...
and therefore, I have
nothing to teach you now.
Sir, it is our mistake,
why are you punishing yourself?
I have done nothing wrong. I was
going to ask for Nandini's hand...
It's time for you to pay your fees.
For the sake of all the knowledge
that I've given you until now...
promise that henceforth,
you'll neither meet Nandini...
nor will you try to keep
any relationship with her.
That is the fees I want.
"Love for you it was that
brought my heart to life"
"Love for you it is
that has ruined my heart"
Nandini, Sameer is going.
Your father didn't agree.
He's not ready to hear anything.
He has only permitted you to
see him once while he leaves.
Get up, Nandini.
Sameer is leaving forever.
See him one last time,
maybe you'll never see him again.
Go, Nandini.
"Of sufferance
my heart cried..."
"I have been punished
for falling in love"
"And what was my crime?"
"I have been ruined..."
"I have been ruined for
falling in love with you"
"Of sufferance my heart wept..."
"I have been punished
for falling in love"
"And what sin have I committed?"
"Devastated I have been,
by falling in love with you"
"Of sufferance my heart cries..."
"In love with you,
I have been ruined"
"Strange is love..."
"where happiness lasts
but for a few moments..."
"Sorrows one gets"
"And Ionely one is"
"Tears and sorrow, grief
and grievances it entails"
"Your face it is that
I see everywhere"
"Your face, I see everywhere"
"Your memories
torment me"
"Your memories torment me..."
"Your face haunts me
in the darkness of the nights"
"In sufferance my heart cries..."
"I have been punished
for loving"
"What was my sin?"
"I am devastated"
"I am ruined in my love for you"
They have come.
Welcome!
- Hello!
You almost disappeared
after fixing the alliance.
Actually, we were busy
with the wedding preparations.
Even we were busy with that We even
have the invitation cards ready.
Our first invitation
and the first card is for you.
The card is very pretty,
have a look.
It is indeed pretty.
Thank you.
Thank us later,
first let us talk about dowry.
What?
- Of course we'll take dowry...
we've fixed our son's alliance with
the daughter of a renowned singer
What do you say?
- As you wish.
Our dowry will be that
you'll sing at the wedding.
I may not be able
to sing on that day...
but Vanraj surely will,
he must have learnt by now.
Vanraj will only
sing for Nandini now.
Auntie, where is Nandini?
Brother has been looking for her.
She's upstairs in her room,
she's not feeling well.
What happened?
She fell from the stairs.
It's nothing serious though.
"My dear Nandu, living without
you is almost impossible"
"It's time we wrote
our own destiny"
"I am sure my love
will bring you to me"
"I'll wait for you,
yours, tangy lemon!"
"I can't believe you didn't come.
But I am sure you will come one day"
"You have my heart; take care of it,
and do come to return it to me"
"Your Sameer - the wind
that has stopped blowing"
We are beginning a new
life together today.
Why don't we begin it truthfully...
because truth is the
foundation of every relationship.
Maybe I shouldn't be
saying this right now.
Actually, I have no words
to describe how beautiful you are.
You must be wondering that you
are so beautiful and mischievous...
how could you marry this man
who is so reserved and quiet.
Is he proud, or is he trying
to prove he's intelligent?
Do you know? I'm the son
of a famous lawyer...
but I lose my cases very often
The truth is that
I cannot stand lies.
I can tolerate anything, but lies.
I've to be up at four in the morning
for prayers. Can I go to sleep?
What happened?
Have I done something wrong?
We are married and
are husband and wife...
If a husband and wife's relationship
only means this, then all right...
What nonsense are you talking?
Have you gone crazy?
Marriage is not physical union,
but the union of minds, of souls.
Since we've been married, I feel you
aren't the Nandini I'd seen before.
Have you been forced into this
marriage, or don't you like me?
Or is it something else?
Tell me Nandini,
tell me before it's too late.
Before we are forced to carry the
burden of this relationship for life.
I've told you this before,
I cannot stand lies.
Tell me Nandini,
I'll support you.
Speak, Nandini!
You won't gain anything
by staying silent.
Brother! Open the door.
Hurry! Open the door.
Switch off the alarm or you'll
awaken the entire neighborhood.
And if brother bothers you again,
tell him it's time for the prayers.
Get dressed and come quickly.
- All right.
Come soon, sister-in-law.
A woman fasts on this day
for her husband's long life.
Is there any greater pleasure
than having a husband?
That's all okay, but where
is the moon, I'm so hungry!
I think the moon will
make us wait long today.
It's hiding behind the clouds. It had
disappeared like this even last year.
Look, the moon!
You liar! We're hungry anyway.
And you're teasing us.
"You have put it to shame,
my love"
"No, Moon... do not show up;
should you show up..."
"my beloved might go away
out of shyness"
"Show up, O Moon...
May you be blessed"
"Do not show up, Moon...
my beloved will go away"
"Let me hide in that veil...
- No"
"Let me lie in those dark tresses...
- No"
"Love is patience, my love"
"How can I be patient anymore?"
"Wait, like the peacock
awaits the rains..."
"Let things be...
do not turn your face away"
"This is yet something else..."
So much!
- It's nothing at all.
You shouldn't have
brought so many things.
Don't embarrass me.
Actually, I was missing Nandini
very much, so I came to meet her.
Since she has come here,
she's been the soul of the house.
Nandini, look who's here.
Your mother probably thinks
we don't look after you.
It's not that.
The two of you sit and chat,
I'll just be back.
How are you, dear?
Everybody misses you
so much at home.
Your father asked me
to look you up.
What did he want to see? That
I'm still alive or have I died?
You're still stuck on that?
Come with me!
What's this? You aren't dressed up,
and you haven't even made your hair.
Don't forget you are a new bride.
You have such a good husband and
in-laws, what more can you ask for?
Don't ruin everything
because of your stupidity.
I'll ruin myself too.
Even Sameer...
Sameer? You shouldn't even
be uttering his name now.
Do you know what you're doing?
You're still holding on
to the past. Let it go.
Or by the time you realize,
you'll have nothing left.
Life is ever changing,
accept the change.
Accept Vanraj, he's your husband.
I can never accept him
as my husband
You'll have to accept him. And why
aren't you wearing your mangalsutra?
They only mean black beads to you,
but the day you realize their worth...
you'll know powerful,
how important they are.
They may be important for you,
but they are a burden on me.
Why don't you try to understand?
And then, Kaushalya
and I laughed so much...
What are you laughing about?
Share the joke.
It was nothing.
I'll take your leave.
But you didn't eat anything.
We don't even drink water at our
daughter's place, or you'll taunt her.
Of course I will!
I'm her mother-in-law after all.
They'll leave for their honeymoon as
soon as Vanraj's court case is over.
Send Nandini home after that.
- Sure.
Give my regards to your husband.
Nandini, come here.
These are some letters
from Sameer.
Sameer's letters?
When did he send them?
Some before your marriage,
and some, after.
But I feared to give them to you.
- That means Sameer was there then.
You should have given me then,
maybe something could have been done.
I didn't get a chance,
it was too late by then.
It's never too late in love.
Maybe we would have met.
- But Sameer would never meet you...
because your father asked him
to promise never to meet you.
He had promised father, I hadn't.
I could have met him.
Take my advice and
burn all these letters.
Vithal!
- Coming!
Burn them.
Nandini, I'm going to the temple.
Will you come along?
- No.
I was going to tell you...
- I'd told you I cannot stand lies!
You had no right to humiliate me
and my family like this.
You cannot live here anymore.
Come. Come!
What are you doing?
Listen to me!
Please!
Where are you taking me?
Let me explain.
Where are you taking me?
Have you gone mad? You want to take
your wife to Italy to her lover?
People will laugh at you,
and at all of us.
What made you take this decision?
Nandini loves someone else.
She doesn't belong to me.
Do you want your son to live in
sorrow just to please the world?
You are a man,
can't you keep a woman in control?
What happened to your manhood?
Is manhood proved by forcibly
robbing a woman of her happiness?
Is manhood another name for
running away from the truth?
Is manhood living with a woman
who's body belongs to you...
but whose heart and soul
belongs to someone else?
Tell me.
Manhood is facing problems,
facing the truth.
Words. Mere words.
I hear them in court every day.
They are very easy to speak,
but very difficult to fulfill.
Will you be able to
bear that moment...
when you give away your wife,
whom you love so much, to another man?
Love isn't selfish.
It lies, not in your happiness, but
in the happiness of the one you love.
I know that moment will
be very painful for me...
...but her one smile
will erase all my pain.
I will need your support
and blessings then.
I may be a great lawyer,
but you are a greater human.
And I am sure you
will win this case.
"My love... O, my master"
"My love..."
"My love..."
"I come to you,
seeking love, my love"
"My love, my master"
Come.
It's very difficult to find a
stranger in such a big city...
that too, without
even having his photograph.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
Get ready, we'll have to
make a beginning somewhere.
I think we may find out something
from a music shop or music school.
I'll get the addresses
from the manager.
You've probably forgotten the
combination. I'll open it for you.
No, thanks.
Get dressed.
The tram has arrived, let's go.
Shall we go?
Wait here while I go
and ask inside.
"My love..."
What happened?
Nandini, he's here.
You are finding it very difficult to
find a stranger in such a big city.
So it becomes necessary
to know how Sameer looks.
He looks like this.
Maybe you'll even laugh
more now, won't you?
Because all this is a joke for you,
even I'm a joke for you.
I wasn't laughing at you
or Sameer, that musician...
He's asking you something.
Here, have the sandwich.
Don't be stubborn,
eat the sandwich.
Have some water.
Drink it!
Look at this!
Haven't you seen such a big tram?
You were running like crazy.
Yes, I've gone mad. I have
lost Sameer because of you today!
Because of me? Thank your stars
that you were saved or...
I would have died!
So what? What would you lose?
Yes, I'd lose nothing!
Remember, until you reach your goal,
your safety is my responsibility.
Who gave you that responsibility?
Who asked you to bring me here?
What relationship do we share?
There is nothing between us.
Why are you trying to play God?
Why are you playing this
game of finding Sameer for me?
You want to impress upon me
that you are great, you are God?
I don't want God.
I'm not trying to be God.
Because you are suffering.
And I'm going to lose both ways
in what you think is a game.
Do you know why?
Because I...
How would you ever know
what love is.
Shall I say something?
- Yes.
I'm sorry for whatever
happened yesterday.
Shall I say something?
- Yes.
You're reading the
magazine up side down.
Shall I say something more?
- Yes.
You were right, there is
no relationship between us.
But we can have one.
Shall I say something?
- Yes.
You are a very nice man.
- I know.
You have a sweet smile.
Keep smiling.
I'd thought I'd forgotten to smile.
If you ever want to laugh, come
to court with me, it's great fun.
Really? Tell me about it.
Silly questions are asked
during cross questioning.
Once a lawyer asked an accused that
he's clearly visible in the photo...
but how can he prove that he was
present when the photo was taken.
Once even I asked
a stupid question.
What was that?
I asked that it is proved that
the basement stairs go down...
but how will you prove that
these very stairs come up too?
And what happened to the case?
- As usual, I lost it.
Shall I say something?
- Yes.
Forget it.
And then came the season of kites.
Listen, mother.
- Go on.
I managed to cut everybody's kites.
Then she taught me Havai.
- Havai?
Their food is mind blowing.
And one day I was fed so much food
that I couldn't control myself.
I went to the terrace, looked left,
looked right, and passed air.
And when I looked behind,
Nandini was laughing at me.
Do you know what she said?
'Sameer, a whiff of air! '
Then?
- Her stupid aunt spoilt everything.
I had asked her father beforehand
what his fees would be.
He'd said that his music
is not for sale...
he'll take it
when the time comes.
Do you know what he
asked for as fees?
What?
My life, Nandini.
Because when I was leaving home,
Nandini came on the terrace...
to see me the last time, and I
told her to become a statue.
She stood like a statue,
but her tears wouldn't stop flowing.
And my father says Nandini will
come, I will definitely get her.
I will get her, won't I, father?
Go and offer the flowers.
No, my father is here.
You are Nandini, aren't you?
See! I recognized you.
Sameer said you'll definitely
come, and you have!
He's always talking about you.
Only today he was telling me...
that he's going to have a show.
He's busy preparing for it.
He thinks of you all the time.
I'm sorry, I talk too much.
Who's he?
Where is Sameer?
- He just left.
You'll find him at
the bus stop. Go!
Where are you staying?
Listen, he sings at the Visconty
Bar in the city every Friday.
"The cool breeze..."
"must even now unsettling her hair"
"Your veil..."
"must even now be
slipping away from your head"
"Your hair must even now..."
"be adorned
by a flower"
"The cool breeze
of the nights..."
"must still be
giving you the chill"
"You must still be
drifting into dreams"
"The sun's rays,
in the morning..."
"must be driving
away your sleep"
"As I see it, my love..."
"you must even be
talking to yourself"
"That I look at you on the sly
is what you must think"
"The cool breeze..."
"must still be unsettling
your hair"
He's married, has a kid, and is
running after another woman.
Do you understand Hindi?
- You speak very fluent Hindi.
I speak very fluent Italian too.
Trust your love, and such
a situation will never arise.
How many people come here
because they fear God...
and how many come
because they love Him?
I come here because
I love Him very much...
and He's my father's friend
In my opinion, God is everywhere.
In fact, He's between us right now.
God is not between us,
He's within us.
If He's within us,
why does He hurt us?
Because we think of Him when in
pain and forget Him when we're happy.
He gives us sorrow,
so that we learn to love.
And if we love selflessly,
it takes us closer to Him.
Have you loved anyone like that?
I have.
- Me too.
But right now, she's in pain.
And I cannot bear
to see her in pain.
When so many people pray,
God gets very busy.
My father is a very good
friend of God, speak to him.
Father, he's my friend, you'll have
to give him whatever he asks for.
What do you do?
Nothing much, like I prayed for you
today, that's more than enough for me.
What brings you here?
- I've come looking for someone.
You've found him! It's good we
met, I was feeling very Ionely.
Maybe you can help...
Do you like music?
- No.
I love music. Do you sing?
No.
- It's obvious.
Even I don't sing these days, but I
love a song which we'll sing together.
"The drum beat..."
"The drums beat loudly..."
Good, but it's not at all in tune.
"The drum beat..."
"The drums beat loudly..."
"And there's a furor..."
"The drum beat..."
"The drums beat loudly..."
"The drum beat..."
"The drums beat"
"The drum beat"
"The drum beat"
"The drums beat loudly"
"The drum beat"
"The drum beat"
"The drums beat loudly"
"She's so very precious..."
"she utters sweet-nothings;
she's doe-eyed"
"The drum beat"
"He's so very mischievous...
and talks so much"
"He says it all
to woo you..."
"the drum beat"
"The drum beat"
"The drums beat loudly"
"This beautiful body of yours...
let me feel it"
"No...
- Please do let me"
"Like the flowers,
a fragrance I exude"
"Do not touch me"
"Come to me, love...
- Let go of my hand"
"My way I will have.
- Don't be a devil!"
"The drum beat..."
"The drum beat..."
"The drums beat loudly"
"She's so very precious;
she talks so sweetly"
"The doe-eyed beauty..."
"The drums beat for her"
"He's so mischievous;
he talks so much"
"He teases me..."
"the drum beat"
"The drum beat"
"The drums beat loudly"
"The drum beat..."
"The drum beat..."
"The drums beat loudly"
"A furor it kicks up"
"A furor..."
"The drum beat"
"The drums beat loudly"
How did you know
I like these flowers?
They are not from me,
they are from him.
I met a very nice man
in the church today...
we even prayed for you together.
And look! When I came here, the
doctor said you can be discharged.
Get dressed.
Your clothes.
At the hotel...
What happened?
Where did you hear this song?
- He...
We'll go to Viscounty Bar tomorrow
Remember, Sameer's mother had said...
But how will we go there?
We don't have any money.
We'll definitely go,
even if it's without a ticket.
The ticket checker is here,
and we don't have tickets.
Remember that day in the train? The
TC couldn't ask for their tickets.
In the train?
Is he coming towards us?
- Yes.
Sameer may come,
we'll wait for him.
No.
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.
Forget it.
You dance very well,
I really enjoyed myself today.
But even I dance well, don't I?
- Yes.
But shall I tell you something?
Yes.
- Forget it.
You know, I've met him.
He's a very nice man.
He'll always keep you happy,
maybe more than me.
Not maybe, he'll definitely
keep you more happy than me.
But shall I tell you something?
Yes.
- Forget it.
You know, when you go away,
I'll be a happy man.
I'll come to meet you.
I'd love meeting the two of you.
I'll call out to you
from that bridge.
You'll recognize
my voice, won't you?
You'll surely recognize my voice.
Come on, chose one hand.
I knew you'd get Sameer.
Even if you'd chosen this hand,
you'd get Sameer.
But shall I say something?
Forget it.
I don't know what
I said last night.
I don't even remember
what I was saying.
Maybe I spoke a bit too much.
- You said nothing.
Sometimes, a person says a lot
without really saying anything.
Whatever I said
last night was not...
Were you lying last night
or are you lying today?
Wishing for something and actually
getting it are two different things.
Love is not just getting...
Iove is to give.
Love!
I think I have now begun to
understand now what love is.
Yes.
- I'm Sameer's mother.
Where is Sameer?
He's doing a show at
Opera theater tonight.
Today is the biggest day of life.
He's coming to take me.
I haven't told him
about Nandini's arrival.
I'll tell him everything
when I meet him today.
My son will be so happy.
Listen, you bring Nandini there.
We'll unite them before the
show itself. Don't be late.
We'll be there.
"My heart I have given away
to you, my love"
"I now belong to you..."
"I swear it on you"
"I have given you
my heart, my love"
"I now belong to you..."
"I swear it on you"
"Atrocities I will bear"
"For you, I will
even lay down my life..."
"I swear it on you"
"I have given you my heart,
my love"
"I belong to you..."
"I swear it on you"
"I swear it on you"
"My hopes I have
pinned on you, my love"
"Your hand, I have held"
"Never will I forget you"
"Never will I forget you"
"My heart, I have given you,
my love"
"I really belong to you"
"I swear it on you"
"In your name, I swear"
"Thinking of you will
I spend my lifetime"
"After the Almighty, it is you
I will worship"
"Ask for anything..."
"it belongs to you"
"Seek anything...
it belongs to you"
"You I have given
my heart away to, my love"
"I do belong to you...
I swear"
"You, I have given my
heart away to, my love"
"I belong to you...
I swear it"
"In your name, I swear"
Will you...
- Nandini!
Sameer has been waiting for you.
Come on, hurry!
I knew you'd come!
And my father had said Nandini will
come to Italy, and you are here.
I'll come down the stairs.
I'd told you, hadn't I,
that you'll come to Italy?
You finally fought your stars
and wrote your own destiny.
And today's show...
After the show, we'll go
to a temple nearby...
and get married.
What happened?
Did I say anything wrong?
You are not happy to see me.
Look into my eyes, Nandini.
The love I used to see in
your eyes for me is no more.
You have changed.
- Yes, I have.
Circumstances have changed.
You loved me, and it was for love
that I came across the seven seas.
But I cannot cover this
small distance between us now.
You taught me to love,
but it was my husband...
who taught me to abide by it.
Husband?!
Sameer, I'm married.
By keeping your promise given to
my father, you fulfilled your duty.
But do you know, after marriage, when
my husband came to know about you...
without given a thought
to what people will say...
without giving a thought
to his own happiness...
he brought me here
to unite me with you...
to fulfill that vow of marriage,
that he'll give me all happiness.
It's then that I realized
that true love is sacrifice.
Now I have to fulfill my duty.
I must go back to him.
Please forgive me if you can.
Allow me to go to him, Sameer.
Go on, you have my permission.
But can I...,
though it's not necessary...
can I meet and see
who the lucky man is?
Oh yes, I've met him.
He's an interesting man.
I even taught him the
song, 'The drums beat..."
He cannot sing at all.
But he loves you very much.
We both prayed for you, I made
him talk directly to my father.
I told father to give him
whatever he asked for.
Father never grants me anything
otherwise, but this once, he did.
I'll deal with you later.
People say that she crossed
the seven seas for him.
But in today's jet age, board a
plane and you're there in seven hours!
But now, you'll have to
live with him for seven lives.
The few moments you spent with me,
are enough for seven lifetimes.
But not more than that, because in
your 8th life, you'll belong to me!
And don't look at me like that,
or you'll fall in love with me again.
Go! Because I look
horrible when I cry.
Now you listen to me! I've been
talking to you since childhood.
Everybody told me that
my father was dead...
but I kept you
alive in my heart.
I never asked anything from you,
except Nandini, but she has left.
She now belongs to Vanraj;
he's her husband.
But I ask you for something,
don't refuse me.
Just hug me once, please!
What happened, son?
- Nothing, I was talking to father.
I was telling Him, first He took
away my father, and now it's Nandini.
Now if He takes you away,
He should call me too.
I don't want to live in Italy,
I don't want to be a star.
"You have given me a body"
"Yet, why have you given me
a heart that breaks?"
"What is worse,
it falls in love..."
"Strange are Your ways, Lord"
"I meet her sometime,
and lose her"
"I unite with her
and lose her..."
"is this love?
Strange are your ways, Lord"
"Out of sufferance
my heart wept..."
"I have been punished
for loving"
"What sin have I committed?"
"Ruined I am
for having loved you"
Shall I say something?
- Yes.
Must you go away?
Shall I say something?
- Yes.
I can't live without you.
