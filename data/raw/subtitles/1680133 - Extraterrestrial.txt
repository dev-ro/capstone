EXTRATERRESTRIAL
-Don't shout.
-Don't shout.
Sorry, sorry.
-I'II get dressed, okay?
-Okay.
Hey...
What?
Do you know where my pants are?
In the Iiving room.
NO SIGNAL
Last night everything
feII out of my pocket
and I'm missing a two euro coin.
It's onIy two euros.
You can pay next time.
Don't worry about it.
Here.
Anyway...
Can I have some coffee?
It's burning.
Thanks.
You're weIcome.
I'm sorry but something urgent
came up...
Do you mind if I make a caII?
There's something wrong with my ceII,
there's no coverage.
This isn't working either.
HoId on.
Mine has no coverage either.
What time does yours say?
-Just past 7:30.
-Just past 7:30?
Yeah, the day got away from us.
Listen, I reaIIy need to be aIone.
I'm sorry.
No one around, at this time?
Even on a Sunday...
Has something happened?
Did you hear anything?
None of the channeIs are working.
It's been Iike that since I got up.
What about the internet?
...in a state of emergency.
PIease stay caIm
and remain in your homes
untiI emergency crews arrive.
Contact them and foIIow
their instructions. Thank you.
HoIy shit! What is that?
A temporary evacuation is underway...
There, out back.
-Got any binocuIars?
-No.
...untiI emergency crews arrive.
The camera...
This is a message
from the Department of Defense.
-This is the zoom, right?
-Yeah.
How big is it?
Look, it's turning very sIowIy.
Yeah.
I think I can figure it out.
If I time how Iong it takes to turn
I can work out its size.
Got a caIcuIator?
Yeah, you want it?
Yes, pIease.
Hey, excuse me...
-JuIio.
-Oh, I'm JuIia.
What a coincidence.
I don't know why I thought
your name was Luisa.
After Iast night no wonder
I can't remember...
By the way, where did we meet?
Hey, aren't you worried
about anybody?
I guess I shouId caII my famiIy,
they're aII in Badajoz.
If the phones are working Iater.
You must have somewhere to go.
Yeah.
Yeah, my apartment.
I Iive in HortaIeza.
I'm renting a room
from some friends of my parents.
I can Ieave if you want.
No, wait tiII I find the caIcuIator.
ShouId I Ieave after that?
No...
Sorry, what was the caIcuIator
for again?
There's somebody there.
Hi.
-AngeI.
-Hi.
This is...
What was your name again?
JuIio.
I'm JuIia, what a coincidence.
He's a friend...
I think you were right
to stay home.
PeopIe were so quick to take off.
Where couId be better than right here?
Wow.
Is there anyone eIse
Ieft in the buiIding?
ActuaIIy, I don't know.
Trucks showed up around nine
with the miIitary and they organized
the cars into Iines.
I think everyone Ieft but...
I don't reaIIy know
because I didn't open the door.
I watched TV aII day
untiI it stopped working.
Is your internet working?
What have you been doing aII day?
Didn't you hear me ringing?
Where did they take everyone?
I don't know, the suburbs,
the mountains...
Not far, because
there are more there.
More what?
More ships.
Don't you know what's going on?
AngeI, is your internet working?
WorIdwide they don't know,
but in Spain
more than 30 have appeared.
EspeciaIIy over the cities.
Have you been in bed aII day?
I tried ringing the beII...
How did you know she was here?
What?
Why didn't you think
she'd Ieft with the others?
Because JuIia aIways parks her car
in front of mine.
And it was there this morning,
that's how.
But you said you didn't go outside.
How did you see it?
From the window?
Yes.
No.
My internet isn't working.
No...
Anyway...
I'm going...
to the bathroom.
No, I'm Ieaving.
I'II caII you Iater, JuIia.
I think it's aImost...
four miIes wide.
Nobody's seen anything coming out,
right?
WeII,
I think they come down from the middIe.
That's why we can't see them from here.
What's up with your neighbor?
Is he aIways so transparent?
What?
It's obvious he stayed
because he saw your car
and knew you hadn't Ieft, right?
How do you know
about aII this stuff?
I'm an industriaI designer.
ActuaIIy, I haven't finished my degree,
but I work making signs,
drawings, modeIs...
I'm working on something amazing.
Some friends of my parents...
WeII, the ones I'm renting from...
They're going to be in a parade
in their neighborhood
and they asked me to make this.
It's a fIoat, something Iike this.
WeII, more or Iess, okay?
And they want a car to puII the fIoat,
but what I did was put the car
inside it.
Sorry, I'm reaIIy tired.
I'm going to bed.
See you tomorrow.
It's okay, it's me.
-What's wrong? What time is it?
-It's Iate, aImost morning.
I was Iooking at the ship
and I thought, shit.
Anything can happen anytime.
Yeah.
I thought we couId take turns
keeping watch.
Don't worry, I'II go first, okay?
But what happened?
No, it's just in case.
I'II wake you up
if something happens, okay?
-Where are you going?
-The Iiving room, stay there.
No, I'm not sIeepy.
-Quick, get up.
-What's going on?
-Are they attacking?
-Get washed.
CarIos!
JuIia.
Where have you been?
They were taking peopIe
to EI EscoriaI...
Sweetheart, I'm so gIad you're here.
They were taking peopIe to EI EscoriaI
and you weren't there...
but there were peopIe
from this neighborhood.
I caIIed and you didn't answer.
And since you had gone out...
By the way, I'm not aIone.
Hi.
CarIos, this is...
-Sorry, what was your name?
-JuIio.
What a coincidence!
Like me.
-Hi, JuIio.
-Hi.
FeeIing any better?
Yeah.
You're Iucky JuIia saw you
from the window. If you'd bIacked out
one street up nobody'd have seen you.
-I aImost did Iast night.
-What happened?
I waIked here from EI EscoriaI.
Eight and a haIf hours.
It got dark at Ciudad Universitaria.
I spent the night in a tent
untiI some jerks woke me up
screaming Iike crazy aII night
and breaking windows.
Nothing happened
but it was scary.
What's this?
Did you draw it?
Yeah, I'm a designer.
Have a seat.
JuIio was drawing
what he saw outside for me.
It's good. Damn, it's spot on.
I know peopIe who've seen it
cIoser up and showed me photos
but you can't see shit.
What's that?
HoIy shit!
I heard about a weird car
driving around.
It sounded Iike
a miIitary vehicIe,
but this is something eIse.
This is serious, damn it!
Where did you see it?
Out there.
Here? On this street?
I didn't see anything.
This is...
I saw it.
It drove right past.
I described it
and this Iooks a Iot Iike it.
Nice going, JuIio.
-Good work.
-Thanks.
-Shit, you couId have toId me...
-I know, I'm sorry.
I'd have Ieft right away
and saved you the troubIe.
I put my foot in it.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
I'm Ieaving.
You're Ieaving?
I'm in the way.
No, you're not.
With aII the mayhem out there...
You might bIack out again.
Come inside.
AngeI stayed behind too.
You don't say.
We can't get rid of that guy,
not even with UFOs. Come in.
Hi, AngeI.
Come by for dinner Iater!
The miIitary has fenced off the area
right under the ship.
ApparentIy peopIe have seen
some crazy stuff out there.
Anyway,
besides that weird tank JuIia saw
I don't beIieve any of it.
You saw a weird tank?
Yeah, I have a drawing of it
in there.
If they brought huge ships aII this way
there must be a reason, right?
They'II do something.
Maybe...
Look, I don't mean to scare you,
but I overheard two cops taIking
at a highway checkpoint
and it's been on my mind
ever since.
Maybe they're aIready doing something
but in a way that we don't reaIize.
I think...
Maybe they're invisibIe.
Maybe they can fit in among us
without us noticing.
But shouIdn't we Ieave?
There are ships everywhere.
I think...
At Ieast we're somepIace
we can controI.
WeII, I think that's pretty Iame.
They come here in fIying devices
bigger than towns
and suddenIy they're worried about
being noticed? It makes no sense.
What do you think then?
Let's hear it.
I think they're testing humans
to see what we're Iike,
how we react,
if we're inteIIigent,
if we're brave...
They're probabIy
watching us and aII the peopIe fIeeing
are making fooIs of themseIves
because there's no need.
I'II pass.
Then those of us staying home
are doing the right thing.
We'II get a prize.
You'II get a prize.
CarIos, heIp me with this.
-No, they're here to staIk us.
-I hope not.
Because our neighbor
has that covered.
-CarIos.
-I'm coming.
Get the peaches I brought,
they're tasty.
I put them in the fridge.
What?
What?
What's the probIem?
What do you mean?
No, what's wrong with you?
Nothing's wrong with me.
What's with that face?
What's with what face?
Come on, I can teII.
You can teII what?
That you're jeaIous.
JeaIous of what?
You can teII I'm jeaIous of what?
That you're into her
and you haven't screwed her.
Oh, yeah?
And why shouId I be jeaIous?
You know exactIy why.
You must have heard us fucking
or something.
Don't give me that Iook
Iike you didn't know.
You knew, stop pretending.
You didn't know?
Try to open this.
My hands are wet.
Let me see if I can...
We're short on food.
We can check
the neighbors' apartments.
I think the supermarket
out back stayed open.
In the worst case we can pIant
something on the terrace.
What do you think, AngeI?
ShouId we pIant Iettuce?
Maybe the spacemen
wiII give us dipIomas.
CarIos...
Shit!
Damn.
-It's nothing.
-Are you sure?
Damn it!
I'm reaIIy sorry.
Does it hurt?
Next time aim the other way
and hoId it tighter.
I can't stand that guy.
Sometimes I wish he'd fuck her to see
if he'd caIm down and Ieave us aIone.
JuIia?
Hard to beIieve I thought
he was a snooty homo at first.
But you can totaIIy teII
he's into JuIia.
You can teII, you can teII...
AngeI, nothing happened!
Don't make things up!
Nothing happened!
Thanks for dinner.
See you tomorrow.
I'm going to bed too.
Wake up!
Is it my turn?
No more turns. You're Ieaving.
Leaving? Why am I Ieaving?
How couId you teII AngeI that?
How dare you!
What did I teII him?
You know exactIy what you toId him.
No, I don't.
You and I never had sex, okay?
I know we didn't.
What are you taIking about?
Hypocrite.
You're Iecturing me on sincerity?
You of aII peopIe.
Where wiII I go?
It's coId.
Let me eat something first,
I'm hungry.
Here.
ReaIIy, JuIia, I didn't say anything.
Maybe I said something
and he understood whatever he wanted.
Who cares anyway?
You don't know him.
He's Iost his mind.
WeII, he'II get over it.
Last night he said
if I don't teII him, he wiII.
Shit.
Come to my pIace if you want.
Wait, wait!
Just one thing and I'II Ieave.
But pIease, Iisten to me.
You win, asshoIe!
JuIio...
I went to the supermarket.
The one you said.
Why did you go by yourseIf?
Come in.
What the fuck are you doing?
-It doesn't fit.
-What doesn't?
AngeI. He said he never Ieft
his apartment,
but he knew your car was parked
in front of his, right?
Yeah, so what?
It turns out his car
is the one that isn't there.
You mean it was stoIen?
Who'd steaI that crate?
At Ieast parked next to yours...
What are the chances everybody
wouId Ieave the buiIding except him?
TeIIing us some crazy story
and watching us the whoIe time...
And the strangest thing...
What scares me the most...
What?
I swear to God I didn't teII him
anything about us.
What do you mean?
There's something strange about AngeI,
we can't trust him
and I think CarIos shouId know
right away.
JuIio! You didn't bring
an extension Iead, did you?
What?
Did you see how he reacted
to what you said Iast night?
About them being among us?
He freaked out.
Okay, are you guys teIIing me
there's a chance
the AngeI next door
isn't the AngeI we know?
I don't know him at aII,
but he seems very weird to me,
a troubIemaker.
I don't know about you guys...
What did he say to you Iast night?
At dinner,
when you two were aIone.
Before he took off aII of a sudden.
He said something to you.
It's been troubIing you ever since.
That you've been acting strangeIy.
That there's something odd
about you.
I said I didn't beIieve him,
of course.
That's why he took off Iike that.
Look, it's unIikeIy this AngeI
is not the reaI AngeI...
but we can't take any chances.
Hey, what's up?
Hi.
Did you take the peaches
with you Iast night?
No, I Ieft them here.
I don't see them anywhere.
I didn't take them.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Are you caIIing me a Iiar?
What?
Are you caIIing me a Iiar?
Why wouId you Iie to me?
I don't know, you teII me.
CarIos, I don't understand.
Why do you say
I'm acting strangeIy?
That's what you toId JuIia
when you were aIone, right?
That I'm acting strangeIy.
Isn't that what he said?
Come here! Come here!
Grab him, JuIio!
JuIio!
JuIio!
Grab him!
Grab him!
I've got him, I've got him!
CarIos, CarIos!
Listen to me!
JuIia's cheating...
Let's see what this bastard
has to say for himseIf.
No!
I'm scared!
Isn't JuIia kind of overreacting?
About what?
Not Ietting him taIk and aII that.
What's he gonna do, hypnotize us?
I don't know.
We couId ask him why they're here,
what the fuck they're doing here...
That weird car JuIia saw,
the one you drew...
Yeah.
Maybe he came in it
and he's got it parked somewhere.
-Don't you wanna see it?
-Yeah, sure I do.
If he couId brainwash us
he'd have done it by now.
Take off his gag.
Wait.
Come here.
Maybe it is the reaI AngeI.
So?
If it's AngeI,
he's bound to go back
and teII JuIia I didn't Iisten to her
and Iet him taIk.
I'm not gonna Iet that bastard
give me away.
Just untie his hands and feet
and Iet him go.
AngeI, if you are AngeI...
I hope you understand,
okay?
I suggest you go
to the shopping maIIs
to the north.
There were no peopIe around.
You know the way, right?
If you're not AngeI...
Don't!
Don't take off the gag!
Turn around and beat it!
You got that?
Hi.
Isn't it CarIos' turn?
It's earIy.
I couIdn't sIeep.
Yeah.
He took out the gun?
You got that, motherfucker?
WeII?
There are no buIIets,
it's just in case.
It's not even Ioaded.
I got it from a sporting goods store
on my way over here.
He showed it to you?
No, I saw it in his pants.
I guess he didn't want to worry me
by taking it out.
I guess.
This is the first thing
we shouId have done.
I don't know why
I didn't think of it sooner.
He's impressive.
He knows what he's doing.
If he knew what he was doing
he'd have thrown you out as weII.
At Ieast now we know
we got rid of that freak.
Thanks for coming back.
Those are pages
from a city guide, right?
Yeah. It's the best view
of the city.
But they're printed
on both sides.
How did you manage that?
I took two guides from taxis
on the way here.
These are the quickest routes.
We'II have to make runs.
JuIio, this is your apartment?
Yeah.
You'II need us to pick up
your things.
Yeah.
What's this Iine?
This is the area cut off
by the miIitary.
The whoIe area under the ship
and these are the barricades
I mentioned.
Okay.
Right, first we'II go
through here to pick up
the generator for when the power
goes out, which it wiII.
Then we'II Iook for
a bookstore downtown.
We'II need manuaIs on
teIecommunications, eIectronics,
stuff Iike that.
I'm making a Iist on the Iaptop.
Who goes with who?
Who stays home?
Nobody.
If we go, it's aII three of us.
Why's that?
If AngeI wasn't AngeI,
what happened to the reaI AngeI?
What if one of us gets Ieft aIone
and they switch us?
We stick together, no exceptions!
Damn!
What?
I found a two euro coin!
Are you sure?
-There are some swings over there.
-Yeah.
I wouIdn't go near them.
When I went by there
I saw some nasty-Iooking guys.
Very dangerous.
SeriousIy, with guns and everything.
They tried to shoot me.
You couIdn't pay me
to go over there.
A gas station.
With enough gasoIine
we can make a bomb.
-But CarIos...
-There are other ways.
A bomb is a bit...
I'm not taIking about kiIIing anyone.
It's just in case
we need to scare someone.
We're not that far from home.
As Iong as we don't head that way
we're fine.
The water's been cut off.
-AIready?
-Yeah.
We'II have to get more bottIes.
ShouId I wake CarIos up?
No. Are there any more
in the kitchen?
-Yeah, I'II get them.
-No, I'II go.
When you waIked by
in the toweI earIier...
I saw your ass.
You did that on purpose, right?
What?
No way, you're joking.
How can you think that?
Come on, you know exactIy
when your ass is in view.
EspeciaIIy if there's a guy Iooking.
WeII, you're Iess carefuI
if he's aIready seen it.
I've aIready seen it?
I thought we agreed
we didn't have sex.
We didn't, but you probabIy
saw my ass.
Right.
-Are you sure we didn't have sex?
-I don't know.
Do you know how the generator works?
It's stiII too dark.
Wait untiI your eyes adjust.
You'II see more.
That's it?
This is aII we're gonna see?
What eIse do you wanna see?
Shit, the power's out.
JuIia?
What?
Lower your voice, you'II wake him.
Are you stiII keeping watch?
Yeah.
Go back to bed.
Get some rest.
I'II never get back to sIeep anyway.
Remind me when we go out tomorrow
to get a 300-foot extension Iead
for the generator.
It's siIent...
but it's better off
in the stairweII.
Or upstairs.
We'II find one that's...
CarIos, what...
''Tune UHF... We're stiII here.''
Damn!
CarIos?
I'm onIy asking you
for one thing.
When I ask you for the paper
don't take haIf an hour
to bring it.
Why don't you Ieave it
on the tabIe?
I've toId you a thousand times
I don't want any papers on it.
I can't be reading a piece of paper.
This isn't the news, this is war.
Then why keep asking for it?
When we're on the air.
I don't want it
when we're on the air.
We are on the air.
-We were, but you stopped.
-No.
-You stopped.
-No, we're stiII on...
This bozo cIaims to speak
for Madrid's refugees?
-You stopped, right?
-No, damn it!
More Iights. We're not the onIy ones
with a generator.
We're not the onIy ones
watching this.
AII those peopIe Iistening to this guy
cIueIess to the danger we're aII in...
CarIos, there's no need to exaggerate.
I'm being IogicaI, JuIio.
If they went to the troubIe
of trying to fooI us,
three schmucks in an apartment...
won't they try to trick
these peopIe on TV?
I'm going to bed.
Me too, my head's kiIIing me.
By the way,
I'II Ieave the Iaptop on
so you can check out my notes.
See you tomorrow.
...imposed by the government
due to this supposed threat.
We're convinced there might be...
AIready?
Sorry.
-You know what we can do?
-What?
With the cans and the hose...
Since the heater isn't working,
we can run the hose out the window,
roII it up in a circIe
and the sun wiII heat the water.
That wouId be nice.
I think I can puII it off.
Great.
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.
JuIio!
What's wrong?
CarIos is gone.
He must have gone out for something.
Isn't that weird? He's the one
who said we shouIdn't separate.
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.
Did you boIt the door?
JuIio, I'm scared.
JuIia, this is insane.
It's not so weird
after what happened to AngeI...
We might have exaggerated a bit
about AngeI, don't you think?
What do you mean?
That we might have exaggerated a bit.
You Iied about his car, didn't you?
No.
''Who'd steaI that crate?''
you said.
How couId you know it was a crate
if it wasn't parked there?
You mean you knew it was a Iie
and you pIayed aIong?
-No, I just reaIized.
-You're a fake!
ManipuIator!
-Hypocrite!
-Liar!
HeIIo?
Somebody boIted the door.
Can you open the door?
HeIIo? Are you guys there?
JuIia?
Hey, open up!
The door's boIted!
CarIos, where have you been?
I went to find an aeriaI.
Hey, you don't think...
CarIos, you said not to separate.
I didn't even Ieave the buiIding.
I didn't...
You're right, I'm sorry.
We shouId have gone together.
Son of a bitch!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I can't ask you to Iet me in,
especiaIIy if I'm upset...
I'm sorry!
CarIos...
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
ActuaIIy, it's what he wanted.
To go out and save the worId.
I don't know why he came back.
Not for me, I assure you.
He went to a Iot of troubIe
to get here.
And Iook how easy it was
to get rid of him.
Yeah.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Wanna have sex again?
JULIA'S FUCKING JULIO
Hey, CarIos!
Look!
Read the tennis baIIs!
CarIos, Iisten!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
What the fuck?
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
CarIos, Iook outside!
Check it out!
JULIA'S FUCKING JULIO
Look what it says!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
Has he aIways been a jerk?
What about you?
Have you aIways been a homewrecker?
What a bastard!
Where's CarIos?
He Ieft! We're aIone!
Where did he go?
Out to find stuff!
He'II be back.
Hey.
The first time I saw AngeI,
when he came to see you,
he didn't ask about CarIos.
Isn't that strange?
You know he can't stand him.
I know, but...
wasn't he surprised
he wasn't with you?
CarIos hadn't been around for days.
AngeI knew we were on the rocks.
You two were having probIems?
WeII, probIems...
I didn't teII you?
I thought I toId you.
We had a crisis.
AngeI Ioves it when we fight.
Have you had many crises?
Of course we have.
We've been together since I was 19.
JuIia, had you ever cheated on him
before?
I didn't cheat on him,
this isn't cheating.
This is...
It's more compIicated.
No, I'd never cheated on him before.
It's working?
HeIIo?
Hi, how did you...
Yeah, JuIio's here.
Okay.
-Okay, we're ready.
-Can you hear me?
Yes.
Hi, JuIio.
Goddamn it! HoId on.
I can see you from here!
Get out of there right now!
Get out!
Okay, I'm back.
Quick, you guys can see CoIumbus
from where you are, right?
To the right.
Yeah, I think so.
Go out on the baIcony and Iook.
I think there's an orange buiIding
on the right.
Are you Iooking?
Yeah.
That was me.
Don't worry, the buiIding was empty.
-But why?
-Take it easy.
JuIio, Iisten to me.
I went to your buiIding
in HortaIeza
and pIanted 4 bombs.
I can demoIish it too.
What?
I need you to do something for me.
But I need a way to force you,
try to understand.
-I'm sorry.
-What do you want?
I'II teII you.
I need my books, notes, Iaptop...
Everything on the tabIe
in the Iiving room.
I need it badIy.
I'm kind of in troubIe.
What's wrong?
I took some stuff from the TV guys
and they're after me now.
Maybe I went too far
but I don't trust them.
-CarIos, pIease...
-Find somewhere safe
in your area to Ieave them.
I'II caII you tomorrow at 8 sharp
and you can teII me where.
I have a remote detonator so I can
bIow up your buiIding anytime, okay?
And...
weII...
JuIia...
What is it?
I miss you.
I won't stop
untiI I regain your trust.
I'II bIow those motherfuckers
back to their saucers if I have to...
CarIos!
You fucking asshoIe!
Bye.
ApparentIy we're not the onIy ones
he's threatened.
He's been seen causing troubIe
at more than one shetIer.
I mean sheIter.
SeveraI, in fact.
Read the paper.
If you see him,
and this is my personaI opinion...
shoot to kiII.
If you interrupt me again
whiIe I'm taIking
I'II kick your ass.
I swear I'II kick your ass.
Just read the paper.
I don't want to read it!
I'II stick it up my ass first!
You want me to stick it up my ass?
Yeah?
Fine, great.
Okay, you tape it so everyone
sees me stick this up my ass.
We're on the air.
-But I said to stop.
-No.
-Yes, I did.
-No.
-I said to stop.
-No.
-Yes, I did.
-No.
Good evening.
UnfortunateIy
sometimes danger appears...
What do we teII him when he caIIs?
Our faciIities have been attacked
by an armed individuaI...
We'II teII him we jumped the gun.
He's dangerous, irrationaI...
That we were wrong
and to come back.
-This is what he Iooks Iike.
-Great!
You know what I'II teII him?
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
JuIia's fucking JuIio!
I'm going over there.
What do we do with him after?
What do you mean after?
I mean after we throw him out.
He's got nothing better to do
than bug us.
Who cares if we take away
his tennis baII machine?
He's got something much worse.
What?
AII the time in the worId.
I know a pIace where he won't bug us
and CarIos won't hear about it.
The garage where I work.
I have the keys.
We can take him there
and Iock him inside.
Lock him in a garage?
It's big, it's where the fIoats are.
We'II bring him food and if he runs out
we'II bring him more.
I'm at the door about to...
Shit.
What's the matter?
He bIocked it from the inside too.
Damn it.
I'II try and...
JuIio! JuIio!
Can you hear him screaming?
This ain't water!
Fuck! You son of a bitch!
If CarIos caIIs at 8
and I don't give him his stuff...
JuIio, what is this?
WiII he do it?
WiII he demoIish the buiIding?
I think so.
You said you don't care, right?
I don't care about the apartment.
JuIio,
what is this?
I've got an idea to get AngeI
out of his buiIding.
Damn, I shouId have put wheeIs on it.
-What time is it?
-AImost 8 o'cIock.
He hasn't caIIed yet?
He wiII soon.
Listen,
if this works and CarIos comes back,
what do we do with...
You know.
The simpIer the better, right?
What?
ExpIain to him you beIieve
he's a human being,
that you know he's not an aIien,
but that being separated and aII this
made you think about your independence,
needing space,
and once you guys have broken up
we'II wait a whiIe,
a coupIe of weeks,
and we'II act Iike we onIy just started
feeIing something for each other.
Isn't two weeks Iong enough?
We'II pIay it by ear.
That's what you want, right?
To take it sIowIy.
-Right?
-Yeah.
Is something worrying you?
Why wouId I be worried?
I don't know.
That he won't beIieve us?
CarIos aIways beIieves me.
JuIia...
AngeI!
AngeI, wake up!
Look down there, on the sidewaIk!
What is that?
They're expIosives.
JuIio's been making them.
We can bIow up your buiIding
whenever we want.
We've prepared a demonstration
for you.
JuIio, do it!
CarIos.
Hi. Is JuIia there?
CarIos, go ahead and do it
if you have to.
Do what?
I didn't bring your Iaptop.
Don't worry about it.
Where's JuIia?
HoId on a second.
Don't you want your stuff?
I did before, but not anymore.
Put JuIia on.
JuIia, what is this?
Here it comes...
SeriousIy, you can go ahead
and demoIish
-the buiIding.
-That's not necessary.
-CarIos, hoId on.
-SeriousIy, Iisten to me.
Something happened.
You'II never doubt me again.
We have a technicaI probIem.
CarIos.
JuIia.
Prove to me you're CarIos
or I'II hang up.
What?
How Iong have you been
preparing this?
-You made a threat, right?
-Yeah, but...
Either make good or I'II hang up.
Are you fucking stupid or what?
Because the CarIos I know
never backs down.
I said, are you fucking stupid
or what?
Now wiII you Iisten to me?
That's my car, damn it!
HoIy shit!
Look where my peaches were!
My car and my peaches!
You bomb peopIe out of their homes
and you're aIso a thief!
JuIio!
Yeah?
Hurry, come back!
Ricardo Rubin.
GonzaIo Prada.
Marta Navarro.
-Okay?
-Yeah.
What?
Those were from
the city of Pontevedra.
Now from Pontevedra province.
-He's taken the whoIe buiIding.
-What?
Yesterday's expIosion was to scare them,
to make them Ieave.
Rebeca MoIiniIIo.
-Ours was just in case.
-He didn't get rid of that guy?
No, because he confessed
he's an infiItrator.
Pedro Pato.
Then CarIos toId him to name
aII the infiItrators in Spain.
Luis AngeI Barreda.
He's just reading random names
to save his skin.
-Doesn't CarIos reaIize?
-Sara CastiIIa.
We'II teII him tomorrow.
Rodrigo Loro.
-TeII him what?
-I said we'II drive there tomorrow.
-What wiII we teII him?
-The truth.
Maria Chau.
What truth?
That we haven't been infiItrated,
we've been Iying and I cheated on him.
No, hoId on a second.
JuIia, you didn't cheat on him.
This was something eIse.
AngeI NumbeIIa.
This is more compIicated.
Maria Jose CarbaIIo.
You want to teII him everything?
Eduardo VaIdivia.
Okay, that's good.
Where's AngeI?
I Ieft him at the...
Him too?
-We'II do GaIicia tomorrow at noon.
- But why?
PIease write down
aII the names on the Iist and share them
with as many peopIe as you can.
We have to stop this.
If you know any of the peopIe
mentioned,
take the necessary measures.
This is off, right?
Okay, then.
-Do you smoke?
-No.
What about you guys?
Don't worry, he'II understand.
I'II go get...
It's funny how your coIIeagues
gave you up so quickIy.
They practicaIIy thanked me.
And how quick you were to confess.
Don't think I'm not aware of it.
I'II feeI better
when my friends get here.
If you're hoIding anything back
we'II get it out of you.
She's as sharp as they get.
Did I teII you she spotted
one of your kind right away?
The day the ships came
she didn't even Ieave her apartment.
OnIy to heIp some stranger
in the street. How about that?
She's the person I admire most.
What sucks is I'm teIIing you this
instead of her.
I don't think I've ever toId her.
It's the first thing I'II teII her
in the morning.
JuIia wants to taIk to you.
We both do.
What?
We're going home.
You can go back to your apartment.
What do you want to teII me?
We owe you an apoIogy.
Out of nowhere?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
Don't teII me.
You screwed things up good, huh?
Did CarIos catch you two humping?
This is going to be good.
That's it, right?
Is that it? Is that it?
Is that it?
Hey, you're going the wrong way...
We're going somewhere
you won't bother us.
But didn't you say JuIia...
I'II teII JuIia I came here,
you got away,
I Iooked everywhere
and couIdn't find you. Period.
What about CarIos?
CarIos, CarIos, CarIos!
Fuck CarIos!
CarIos has nothing to do with this.
I'm fucking in charge here
and I've had enough of you.
Shit.
The miIitary has fenced off
the area right under the ship.
ApparentIy peopIe have seen
some weird stuff out there.
I don't mean to scare you, but...
maybe they're aIready
doing something but in a way
we don't reaIize.
Maybe
they can fit in among us
without us reaIizing.
Shit!
What was I saying?
I was saying something.
AngeI.
I'm sorry.
PIease, forgive me.
What?
I didn't know...
-I didn't know...
-You didn't know what?
PIease, Iet me go.
I'm begging you.
You'II never see me again.
I'II Ieave Madrid.
I've got a house in Cantabria.
I'II disappear.
PIease, Iet me out of the car.
I won't teII anybody that you're a...
that you're a...
WeII, you know.
-You're untied.
-What?
I didn't reaIize.
Here.
Anyway...
-You're Ieaving, right?
-Yeah.
You won't hurt me, right?
No.
ActuaIIy I'm thankfuI.
Why is that?
Because I've tried to get out
of this situation before and...
it's reaIIy tough.
What is?
Not having the baIIs to Ieave
when you know for sure
nobody wants you.
Right...
Here, take this.
I don't want it.
That means...
everything you've done...
you did it aII for her?
Yeah.
Like you.
Yeah, but there's no comparison...
Hi, it's me.
Sorry, I set this up
because I didn't want to wake you.
I understand you wanting
to come cIean about everything
and teII everybody, okay?
But I don't know...
I was thinking...
and I came up with one more Iie.
Freeze!
Hi.
What were you doing in there?
I...
I'm sorry.
What are you sorry about?
-Where's JuIia?
-She's fine, at her pIace.
But...
CarIos.
I came to apoIogize.
ApoIogize?
For actuaIIy being a...
You know.
I promise you I meant weII.
I was gonna Ieave, take my...
machine and Ieave.
You wouIdn't Iet me, remember?
But after that I thought,
''You'II never be this cIose again.''
You know how boring
my Iife is up there?
Wait, wait, wait!
That thing over there is yours?
Yeah.
I saw it.
It drove right past. I described it
and this Iooks a Iot Iike it.
That weird car JuIia saw,
the one you drew...
Yeah.
Maybe he came in it
and he's got it parked somewhere.
-There are some swings over there.
-Yeah.
You couIdn't pay me
to go over there.
You had it parked by the swings.
-Son of a bitch!
-CarIos!
What I'm most sorry about
is you Ieaving.
ActuaIIy, we got rid of you.
It was me, JuIia was against it.
I boIted the door and convinced her
not to open it.
But why?
Your notes, CarIos.
Your books, aII that information.
I was dying to get my hands on it
without raising suspicion.
I was sick and tired of pretending.
-That's why you did it?
-I swear.
That's why you kept it.
That's right.
And that's why you didn't care
if I demoIished your buiIding.
You gave me a random address.
ExactIy.
I onIy wanted to Iearn about you.
When I go back they probabIy
won't even ask what I did.
They might not even know I came down.
AImost nobody does.
No?
WeII, maybe to take a stroII,
Iike I was doing when I bIacked out.
But hardIy anyone.
Do the ones on the ship know
what I've been saying on TV?
If the guy on TV were one of us
they wouId have rescued him.
They don't give a shit.
Damn.
What I did to that poor guy...
I've got him there.
Why did you Ieave the apartment?
JuIia reaIized you were one of them,
didn't she?
ActuaIIy she never beIieved
you were one of us.
Is she by herseIf right now?
Then there was AngeI...
I don't wanna hear about that jerk.
Here, Iet me. I'II handIe it.
-This is the key?
-Yeah.
He's in a smaII room by the set.
I'II cIear things up for him.
Hey!
Why are you here?
Yeah, with the ships and aII that.
There's no reason.
What?
You came for the heII of it?
We extraterrestriaIs are Iike that.
If my pIan works,
CarIos wiII be back anytime.
So erase this tape right away.
And that's aII.
ActuaIIy, it's not.
There's something
I want to teII you.
I came cIose to saying it
many times but I thought
it might sound too...
forced,
too untimeIy,
too fake.
I'm not saying it won't sound fake now,
but I have to say it.
I Iove you.
How did you tape it?
What do you mean?
In a singIe shot or did you edit it?
A singIe shot.
I turned on the camera and said it.
You didn't write it down first?
It just came out?
Yeah.
It's not so hard, is it?
If I don't have it on paper
in front of me...
I butcher it every time.
