Screenplay: Péter Dóka and György Gát
We will be soon there, Spotty.
You have to endure!
Music
I won't go any further! I'm tired. We marched all night.
Spotty, we are all tired.
You said huge carrots are growing here.
Cabbages reach the sky.
But it is the same as in our old forest.
We are all tired.
I still won't go any further!
This forest is the same!
No, not at all!
This is a special forest.
NATURAL RESERVE
Look!
Dad. There are no foxes here, right?
# Just look around! #
# Isn't this great? #
# You see peace, yet it is not just a dream. #
# Just look around! #
# This is a happy land. #
# Protect the home of your people! #
# The journey ended today. #
# Every pilgrim waits a destination. #
# The world can be an adventure for you. #
Vuk Jr. is scary. Everyone is scared of Vuk Jr.!
# This is the place... The wind laughs, it kisses you. #
We are safe here from the humans and their lightning rods.
But what about the foxes?
There are foxes everywhere, but if
you grow up, there won't be any fox
who can catch you. Not even the famous Vuk.
Even he is the fastest fox.
Have I told you...?
When he chased me...
This is a very interesting story...
It started when I roamed, looking on the
fields, searching for something tasty
Run, cubs! Into the forest.
NATURAL RESERVE
Brothers, we found you.
[RAPPING] Another family, too bad they just hares. They propagate, and the reputation of this place goes away. The forest overpopulates.
Rabbit smell. I'm feeling rabbits.
I'll eat you for lunch.
OK. Just this time, I won't hurt you.
It's time to hunt.
I'm going, Csele. I'm going.
Dad! Can I go with you, right?
No. Only when you will be bigger.
You are still a cub.
Cubs must stay home.
Bring him with you!
He is just like you. And as stubborn as you.
OK, but try to act as grown-up.
First of all: do the same as me.
Mom will be angry if you get such dirty.
My fur is too red. It would glow in the moonlight.
This hunt is cool!
[RAPPING] Too bad that the famous Vuk is now hunting with his little scrub.
Quietly. We have to sneak, or the dinner will notice us.
And when you are near... My son. Vuk Jr.!
Where are you?
This stinks!
Oh, my boy. I said, being
calm is the most important.
Anyway, the polecat, you can't...
Because the polecat... My son!
Son! Stop! Be careful!
Thanks, dad.
I think this is my most unsuccessful hunt.
Sssh! Listen!
When there is a human, there is a dinner too.
Sure. Next year too. Bye.
Bye.
Leftovers.
Humans. Dogs.
Come on, my boy. There won't be any problems.
You have a good nose.
You will notify the others.
Come on! Run! Don't stop!
I'll go back and lead them away.
They will follow me.
The swallows are making new nests.
The little otters ran away again.
They swam down on the creek.
I found them almost at the lake.
Listen! The humans are back.
With dogs... and lightning rods.
You have to hide!
The humans? With lightning rods?
I'm not joking.
They are coming with the lightning rods and the dogs.
Silliness. The humans are good. They care with us.
If you really want to eat something tasty,
you can find it in their gardens.
I'm planning to move to the village for the winter.
Sut, Sut. Leave the 'rog. They don't believe me.
Say to them to listen to me!
Tush! It must be your brain! Because of the hunger.
The humans. They are attacking again.
They are hunting for us.
The humans are our friends.
[RAPPING] This is the end of the peace. The humans are attacking the forest with guns.
Where are they?
They must stuck on their way here.
Hide under the fern!
To the left. To the left.
Mom.
Mom, what's the matter with you?
Everything will be alright. Run, my son.
That red fox is beautiful.
He is mine.
Come on! Get him!
Get him!
[RAPPING] Gophers... they are dead like stones. Who are you killing? Bunnies are getting killed, the foxes are caught and chained...
Haven't you seen Vuk, my father?
Kár, kár! Haven't you seen my father?
I knew that they will be back.
Come on, Colonel! Hunt to hunters!
Colonel, are you deaf?
Oh, sure you are.
The money is at the bikers.
Send the animals, or you can forget your circus.
Look! What is this, Sut? Follow them!
Stop!
Officer of the forest.
Stop!
My circus.
Who I'm married to?!
You can't drive. Of course, you can't even make magic.
And to top it all you are getting sloppier.
Where is the acrobat with all the muscles who enchanted me?!
Who promised me to be the queen of the circus.
Just look at this!
I want a brick circus. You promised me. That fits me.
What a dupe!
Just not with that hand! My honey.
Pl... please not with that.
Mr. Circus, I want to take a look in the caravan.
We are simple circus people.
I see it, mister.
But since poachers are lurking around...
I have to look into every truck...
I have to...
Circus maximus... Omnibus...
Circus maximus... Omnibus...
Why are not you more careful?
Take back Chimpy to his car.
Arcadonna, my only one. Please don't be angry!
You see, I still got my power.
You see, it works.
Chimpy, get in!
# You can feel it what I feel... #
Sut. That fox girl is very nice.
Come on, Vuk Jr. Let's get going!
You can go, Sut. But I'll check the humans.
Let's see you lazies, if you can do
it better than the miserly last time.
What are you doing, Balfék?
Come on, Igor. Pull it!
Let's do it, sissies!
Why are you sleeping?
Jobbfék, if you want see the next morning, then do it.
# A stray angel came with the wind... hidden into a girl's heart, where she can be now? #
# ...hidden into a girl's heart, where she can be now? #
# I'll find her wherever she goes... This is the destiny... #
Hi! I'm Carmella, an acrobat.
And who are you?
I... I'm... A... A... Alex.
Carmella!
Oh! My father is calling. I've to go.
But we will be in the village for at least a week.
Come and find me, A. A. Alex.
Carmella.
Every free born animal are my brother.
The freedom is our animal right!
And one day we will be free again.
The freedom worth more than the food served on plate.
The freedom is more than a comfortable bed.
Maybe it is comfortable, but it is still a cage.
[LISPING] Come here, and see it yourself what freedom is like.
There is a jungle out there.
You can die in no time.
And your skin winds up as a furry carpet.
Can't you see what are you doing?
Don't you care with yourselves?
You are being exploited. And what are you getting in return?
Leftovers.
And you...?
It is time for a revolt.
My brothers!
Can you smell it?
How strange. They have no smell.
To be frank, my nose is not the same as it used to be.
Sut. They don't have a smell.
But I'm still feeling something.
No.
I must be imagining it.
Everyone has a smell.
But... I'm feeling something.
Hey, foxes!
Why aren't you moving?
What an urban manner is this?
Do you disdain the country foxes?
I'll give it to you!
Pompous, urban scoundrels!
Look, those foolish wood-dwellers.
Mom. Are the wood-dweller foxes so foolish?
We don't say the word... fool, my dear.
We say... inane.
Hey, you goosy wild red fox.
This is just a painting. It isn't living.
It doesn't have any smell and it can't
move because Arthur, the director made it.
But you are real, aren't you?
Or... you are a painted delusion too?
Sure I'm real.
Hey, look man!
Innit this wild fox smell?
Sure it is. Maybe.
It is possible.
Yes!
Then... alarm!
Run, little red. Run away!
Come on, Vuk Jr.!
Get him!
You are too stupid to do this.
Do you see, Colonel? This happens all the time.
The animals vanish again.
Only some blood stain.
Few orphaned feathers and nothing else.
Let's go home, my little buddy.
Done.
We were faster than the last time.
Weren't we, honey?
You break the record with one minute.
Awesome!
His ear drooped the same way.
He was a very cute little fox.
He resembled to you.
Every free, wood-dweller fox resembles.
But he is the same as you.
Just a bit... smaller.
Everything will be alright, little buddy.
And what happened to him?
No, don't even say!
He got very tired.
We almost caught a cool little fox.
With might and main.
Ware!
What a strong hand she has.
What have I done to deserve this?
All I want is my well deserved circus.
How nice you are.
My boy. What have you got this time?
A little vulpes vulpes.
A little red fox.
If you have been riding around in the
forest, then you were not exercising.
If you are not exercising, you won't get stronger.
Your legs won't work again.
Okay, dad. But now this little fox needs help.
Let me guess...
Acepromazine.
A strong sedative.
Poachers... here?
Voilà.
He is fine.
No problem, little buddy.
I'll bring you back to your forest.
The world famous Circus Trilibus is here!
Exotic performances. Lions...
Go home, little fox.
You can walk now.
I have to get back to Csele and to the cubs.
I have to escape.
If you escape, they will hurt you.
If they hurt you, it hurts me too.
You could be my father.
Ibis, if you could escape,
the human would find you
because of the collar.
Like following your smell.
But it is so nice.
Nice... Nice... Just think of it as the extended hand of the human.
# This is a colorless dream. I can only see your face. I'll guess your name. #
I... want... money... from... you... And...
you... want... these... animals.
Shut up!
Not you!
L... look! Arcadonna wants money.
You have to pay.
Are you talking to me, man?
We've changed our minds!
We want the motorbike.
The bike?
[RAPPING] I know what happened... and it is strange... because Vuk Jr. had enough... drank too much...
Hey, brother. Pull his whiskers!
No. Pull his tail.
Vuk Jr.
You are still alive?!
I thought they have taken away you too.
I got saved by a human, who has wheel legs.
I'm so happy that you are alive.
You smell like a human.
What is it?
I wasn't imagining it.
I can still feel its smell.
The human's?
Oh, no. This is... my dad's smell.
I recognize it.
Vuk Jr. Your father has died.
He was the hero of the forest, but...
That smell. It is...
Dad is at the circus.
What are you talking about?
He is there.
I'm going to the circus.
I'm going back.
Faster, man!
This is not fast enough, man!
Wake up, you lazies! The rehearsal begins.
Come on, come on!
Carmella! Carmella!
Where is this girl again?
And what happened to you?
You have been drinking...
We have been motorcycling.
Motorcycling?
But you don't have a motorcycle.
Sure we have.
We have.
Here it is.
We got it from the hunters.
This is the top business.
This worth at least twice as much...
Aren't you happy?
WHAT?!
# There was silence in my heart but now I've arrived home. #
# Fragile world, let me protect you... #
- I can see you.
- I remember you. A. A. Alex.
- Why don't you walk here?
# The world shines through your smile. #
- I'm sorry. I'm so dumb.
- I'll walk there. OK?
Hey! Now this is something!
I'm knotting it... I'm not knotting it.
I'm knotting it... I'm not knotting it.
I'm knotting it... I'm not knotting it.
Voilà.
There is a knot... There is no knot.
Jobbfék. Chimpy will train with you today.
Okay.
Come here, sticky-fingers.
Hey, brother. Have you been wearing my luxury pants?
I have only two friends.
One of them is Colonel.
He used to be the most famous hunting dog.
But a shot with a double barreled gun near his ear made him deaf.
His owner brought him to my father to put him to sleep.
But I haven't allowed them.
I made him a hearing aid Instead.
You know, Colonel is like me.
The modern technology is the key.
He couldn't live without it.
And who is your other friend?
This is it.
Turbo 3000.
It has a built-in computer, display and a strong engine.
I can go faster with it than a healthy boy.
# The destiny made this way. #
# Thanks to my prayer. #
Are you sure they wrote this?
Hey! You can't even read.
Just stay put.
Scream if it hurts!
Our accident happened here.
We have been on grape harvest festival like every year.
We set off at dawn. A jeep crashed into us.
It changed lanes.
It was a frontal crash.
I flown out. Mom got stuck under the car.
She died instantly.
Only my father was unharmed.
A woman drove.
In the end she wasn't convicted.
She got exempted.
How come?
No one knew.
Not even my father.
Is this... permanent?
The doctors are saying that with exercising I could walk again.
But I don't believe them.
These are dead already. I rather scorch with my wheelchair.
Colonel? Colonel, let's go.
Enough of this.
Time to practice Toby's new trick.
This... Oh, this is beautiful.
I come here to think.
Colonel too.
It must be awesome to travel around the globe. Like you do.
Sure. With Arcadonna, the evil stepmother.
I have to go back.
I'm sure they have started with the rehearsal already.
Why don't you come with me?
You would like it.
Come... come on!
Give me fire!
Arthur! Give me fire!
You worth something after all.
Come on, you lazy pig.
I hate fire.
His tail is on fire.
My tail!
My tail is buuurrrrning!
Are you out of your mind?!
This is my best cloth.
Where is former glory of our circus?
This is animal torture.
My god. It is not possible.
He died.
What is he doing here?
We are practicing.
He is my friend.
Strangers are not allowed during the rehearsal.
You better go out now.
Wait for me outside.
Fraternize outside!
Come on, bring the foxes!
By the way, get me the red too.
Tie him strongly.
I have to lecture him.
Look! He made a hole again.
He would have escaped in half hour.
Do you want more?
Beautiful animal.
Dangerous beast.
Look into his brain! Take away his will. Brainwash him.
At least you will make something useful.
Jobbfék. Balfék.
Music.
Your scent is fantastic.
You are beautiful.
Okay, cubs. Tighten your backs. Chase! Let me see!
# I feel that I always feel. #
- Dad's smell is coming from there.
- He must be inside.
- Sut, wait me here.
# I can't let you go. #
# You look to me and you can see. #
# I wipe away your tears... #
# ...you will have nice dreams if I protect you. #
# I open my arms but you step by me. #
- Oh. I have never seen a flying fox.
Dad!
Vuk Jr.
Come on, my son.
Hey, Vuk Jr. You can't take away my fiancé.
Jobbfék. Balfék. The acrobats are escaping.
That's it, little red.
Loafers! The foxes are escaping!
Come on!
Revolt.
Call the cops!
The cops? Are you crazy?
We really don't need them.
What happened with this?
You have to get out of sight!
So you are the clown?
You overlooked again.
You are playing weakly today.
What's your problem?
I guess you haven't slept again.
Oh, just the usual.
I dreamed about the accident and waked with a start.
You have to move on, Doc.
At least because of your son, Alex.
But I still can't understand why that witch got exempted.
That's what I'm saying. You should care with your son instead of this.
He is adolescent now. He is smart, and he
loves the forest, the animals, the nature.
Yes, he always roams in the forest.
He is not doing his exercises.
They said in the clinic that there is a chance.
He brings me an injured animal every week.
His craze are the poachers.
I don't want anything bad to happen to him.
You know, he is the only one who left to me.
I wish I would be as determined as Alex.
The nicest animals are vanishing.
No one knows where to.
I'm alone, and can't look after everything.
And I have strange memory losses.
Memory loss?
Yeah.
Last time I've been checking
some circus people and my last
memory is that the director
rises his rod before my eye.
As far as I can remember it ended in a carved snake.
A rod with a snake head on it?
Snake head... on a rod.
What's up with Csele and the cubs?
There is no one else.
I'm the only one who left.
Mom saved my life. Since then, Sut, your old friend, raised me.
Just like Karak raised you.
At least you are alive, Vuk Jr.
At least you are here for me.
I'll get you out of here.
Get closer.
Look! I caught this for you.
Oh. This is really nice from you.
You have so big, beautiful ears. You hearing must be good.
Young lad... This is very country-like pace.
And you have so nice forest-smell.
The smell of getting out.
No, not smell. The sweet scent of freedom.
This is disgusting.
Tell me, how the the forest looks like?
The forest is beautiful.
Sometime I go to up to a hill, and I play with the 'rog.
What is a rog?
The frog!
In the morning I run
after the 'utterflies.
Or I lay down on the
fields and enjoy the sun.
I can't allow you you yobbo to bother my fiancé.
[LISPING] Chew off his tail!
Get him, Tim!
Come on, Vuk Jr.! Show these flabby
circus apes how a free fox fights!
Warning! Fleas.
I said that this red devil will set us free.
That freedom will bite, I can say.
This is Chimpy, the king of the thieves and rebels.
And they are the foxes. The flying foxes.
And he... he is Toby, the dreadful but
really loved king of the savannah.
He don't have any teeth.
I'm currently making his denture.
Hey! This is my little fox.
How he got here?
He is the newest catch of Arcadonna.
Please let him out! He is my friend.
I've seen him in the forest just yesterday. Freely.
Okay. But first, I'll take off his collar.
Run! Escape!
I'll come back for you.
The traffic is heavy today.
Heavy traffic?
Follow them, you idiot! They escape!
I really don't need this cripple's idiot father here.
Come on, you old screw!
Faster! Go faster!
Toss she off!
Toss she off! Don't pity her!
The time will come.
The collar! Don't forget the collar!
It causes trouble.
Come on!
Help me, Colonel!
I know your teeth are not as good as they
used to be, but you must help me now!
Vuk Jr. is fighting like his dad... while his strength lasts.
Vuk Jr.?
Vuk Jr.?
Vuk Jr.?!
You are not Vuk Jr.
No. I'm Tupi. His best friend.
Have you seen him?
Why are you wearing this like the dogs?
I have to get it off. Please help me!
Quickly!
Can I have it?
Sure, but don't wear it because it's dangerous.
This radar is awesome.
We will get our escapees in no time.
Do you know how it works?
Don't talk that much! Just say where should we go!
You don't know, right?
Why? Do you know?
Let's turn right.
We already got one of them.
Toss her off!
The time will come.
It is now. Now!
The fox is mine.
You better get out of my way or I shred you...
...and even your father, the doctor
won't be able to put you together.
You little flea bag.
You ruined my hand.
Bring it baaaaaaaaaack!
Good bye, my little buddy. And thanks.
Help me! Help me!
Dad. Dad.
My god.
How do you look like again?
I've been chased by a crazy, one-handed women from the circus.
And my little red fox saved me.
My dear son, you shouldn't
play your computer all night.
You are not getting
enough sleep.
Believe me, dad.
She wanted to kill me.
Stop kidding. Why would she?
I have no idea. But she is really angry at me.
She knows us. I don't know where from, but
she even knows that you are a doctor.
How does she look like?
Do you have a photo?
Sure I have.
And who is she?
A friend of mine.
I think tomorrow we will go to the circus.
Where have you been?
Let's move and snug everything up.
Our acrobats are getting away and you
are fraternizing with a cripple?
From now on you are grounded.
Honey. Why do you need that?
Another question and I'll lock you up too.
Finished.
Toby can use it now.
I brought you the hand of the human.
This means that we can defeat them if we are brave enough.
Vuk Jr., you are a real hero. A real Vuk.
Don't be afraid of it. It won't hurt anyone anymore.
Come on, smell it!
My friends. Forest animals.
I met a lot of strange animals in the
circus, who are living in captivity there.
The humans make them do strange
things in that huge colored building.
But the circus animals are our friends too.
Because all animals are friends.
And now, meet two of them.
She is Zizi, the horse from the circus.
Hi! I'm Zizi.
Hi, Zizi!
And she is Ibis, the flying fox.
An acrobat.
And my friend.
I'm Ibis.
An acrobat.
We have to join with our friends from the circus...
...and together with them we will fight against...
...the lightning rods, the whiplashes,
the collars and the humans.
When we get there, we have to take off their collars first.
Those are the power of the humans.
My friends, my bothers.
Here is the messenger of
the freedom, savior of
the animals, the dauntless
warrior with red fur.
The famous Vuk.
He is the one who will lead us out to the forest.
To the free world.
That's right! Eat the man!
I mean, eat the dinner first, then rise after that.
You can't revolt with empty stomach.
Thank you, brothers.
Let's taste this word: brother.
Turn to each other, and say: brother.
Come on!
My brother.
My sister.
These are not artists.
I won't leave the boards behind.
I suggest you brothers that tomorrow
we should escape during the show.
I'll lead you to my forest.
To my forest where I know every
roots, every pebble in the stream.
I know when the snow falls, when
the spring breeze starts blowing.
Attention, forest animals!
We have to wait till the show starts.
Arcadonna and the director will be too busy to notice anything.
We can surprise them.
Ibis is right. We have to wait till tomorrow.
We will meet here at sundown. Then...
Excuse me but my stomach is growling.
When do they bring us the dinner?
Bring it?
Well, I don't know.
Are you hungry already?
Sut, tell her!
Come here, Ibis.
I have to tell you how we get the food here.
No one will bring it here to you.
Then what?
What are we going to eat?
Thank you.
You can sit anywhere.
Meine damen und herren. Ladies and gentlemen.
The world famous Circus Trilibus starts its show.
Get Arcadonna out of the picture!
Then her snake.
My daughter, Carmella.
And the queen of the circus: Arcadonna.
You can see Arcadonna... the queen of the circus.
You ungrateful snake, don't leave me here.
I have to sssee... the foressst.
Let me ssslide with you.
Okay, you can come.
Every animal is our friend.
Even you too.
You all heard of Igor, the Caucasian bear.
Igor, lift it up.
Only at the Circus Trilibus...
the fox family... the flying foxes.
And don't forget about my assistant, Chimpy.
Don't let him detract your attention.
Watch his hands!
Where are the wild animals?!
We want the lion!
There was a lion on the poster.
We demand the flying foxes!
Give our money back!
Give our money back!
Give it back! Where are the horses?
Where is the king of the savannah?
...our money back!
Give our money back!
Give our money back!
Give our money back!
Give our money back!
Looks like the mood is good already!
Should we go in, Vuk Jr.?
Yes, we'll go in!
Where are the wild animals?!
We want the lion!
Where is the king of the savannah?
Where are the horses?
Hey, Vuk Jr.!
Where are our friends?
Dad, where are you?
Stop!
Don't be afraid!
My friends.
Come on, we have to find the others!
Do you want to play?!
Then take this.
So here they are.
We are out.
Then let's go!
Follow me!
Read it!
[USER'S MANUAL]
So...
The press... of the red button... will shock... the target
Let's rock.
What a word class performance!
We are glowing! Unbelievable.
It hurt a little though.
Climb over the branch!
It is strong enough.
You will be safe on the other side.
And what about you?! How will you come?
I'll help him.
I can defend myself.
Help me!
Follow your little girlfriend!
No! No! No!
Toby, no! Toby!
Vuk Jr., you are the greatest little fox.
Oh, no!
Alex.
It is so good that you are here, dad.
My little son.
The tale is over.
The good won.
And from now on the evils won't go close to the forest.
Keep your chin up, brother!
We will have the best jail circus performance!
We will do the sawing of the glowing man!
It will be awesome!
Or not?
Soon there will be new blossoms on the trees, new petals on the flowers.
And soon cubs will be running everywhere.
The nature will renew.
The cubs will become adults.
The adults become elders.
Till wild animals live in the forest...
...they will be telling how Vuk Jr. the son of the famous Vuk...,
...the greatest little fox, saved the animals of the forest.
Based on the novel Vuk by István Fekete and Vuk and the Simabőrűek by István Fekete Jr.
