I hate it when

Well, the boys have it, too.
It grows back thicker.
It's stronger for it.
- I know.

I just don't like to see it.
It's no different to a baby
getting its head dunked

You are here for the cleaning?

Excuse me for a second.
Hello? Yes?
Hang on, give me a second.
(In English) You can do it now

But I never confirmed.
(In French) Yes.
It won't fit?
You're telling me now?
I don't care what he says.

You'll have to refund me.

Yes. Bye.

So, you are English?
When I saw you at the door, I...

you can use it if you like.
I'm Geneviéve.
Mary.
You don't speak any French?
- (Grunts softly)
- OK, I'm sure they told you...
- (Mobile ringing)
- (Sighs) I'm sure they told you, but, er...
I just need someone for a very short term
to help me with the clear-up.
You know,
before the movers come.
So maybe, for today,
you can clean
the bathroom and do laundry.
(Mobile continues ringing)
OK?
- Where are you moving to?
- Oh, we're staying in Calais.
- When are you moving?
- Saturday.
I know... I know I left this far too late,
but... (Sighs)

Sorry, can I just leave you
down there to start here?

Solomon's father.
Mary, don't worry
about folding them.
They're just going in bags.
(In French)
Sol, what are you doing up there?
(Solomon) Nothing.
(Geneviéve)
You can bring stuff down.
(Solomon)
Why isn't Dad here doing this?
(Geneviéve) Oh, please, not now.
There's so much stuff!
(Signs)
(Solomon) When is he coming?
In two days, when we've moved.
(Solomon) Only then?
(Geneviéve)
Listen, don't start, please.
Do me a favour, yeah?

OK?
You're going at a snail's pace.
(Solomon) I'm having a break!
You've hardly even started.
(In English) OK?
(In French) Thank you.
What's in here?

You really don't know how to film.
(Man, in English)
'Yeah, that's good!'

I look like an idiot.
See, you used to let me hug you.
I remember dressing you in that.
- (Solomon) I'm not eight anymore.
- (Geneviéve) No, I know.
You were so cute.
(Geneviéve speaking French on TV)
Look how happy he is. (Laughs)
Look at your father.

- (Solomon) No, I only found that one.
- Oh.
(Sighs deeply)
(In English) Er, I'm finished.
You have a light?
Thank you.
- Did you convert when you married?
- Yes.
How do you feel
about wearing it?
- How do I feel?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't.
I've worn it
longer than I haven't.
It must have been hard
to take all that on?
Back then, I did something
for my husband
that no one else could.

What were you doing in my house?
I left... I left my bag.
And I just popped back
to get it.
Why did you run?
Because... you scared me.
- What were you doing upstairs?
- I...
Were you watching?
Of course not.
I left my bag.
And, erm...
I told your mum I was coming.
She gave me the keys.
You can ask her.

You know, when I was young,
we used to write letters.
My husband and I were
a secret, too.
For years.
Before his family found out.
Must have been a bit younger
than you.
(Keypad slacking)
About 14 when we got together.
Every summer...
he'd go to his family's village
in Pakistan.
Well, I couldn't write
to him there.
So...
we agreed that we'd look at the moon
at the same time every night.
(Mobile chimes,
Mary chuckles)
He made
these cassette tapes for me.
So I'd listen to those.
That's how we saw each other.
And what if there were no moon?
Well, I guess we didn't see
each other that night.
But I'd hear him.
Have you ever been to the UK?
Yeah, once.
With your dad?
Where'd you go?
Dover Castle.
(Chuckles) Dover Castle.
Was that on a school trip?
Yes.
But I ran away from the group
to find my dad.
Why?
I guess I wanted to see
where he works.
Did you find him?
No.
I got lost.
The police found me.
When was that, then?
A few years ago.
Dad was really angry.
Well, he was...
He was probably just worried
that something might happen to you.
Parents are like that.
(Geneviéve, in French)
Solomon, my love.
Yes!
(Geneviéve)
Can you throw this for me?
Come on, don't sulk.
- Both bags.
- No.
Yes, both.
(indistinct chattering,

(Ship's horn blows)

(In English) So much crap,
I can't believe it.
Mary?
That's nice.
Thank you.
- Sol?
- (Door slams)
Sol!
Sol?
(In French)
What's your problem?
(Solomon) Vincent saw you with that prick
from Geography. Arnaud!
- He saw you in his car!
- (Geneviéve) What?
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is! Don't lie, OK?
You think I'm stupid.
I've known about them all.
- I'm not moving to that house with you.
- Why are you saying that?
- (Solomon) I want to live with Dad.
- (Genevieve) But he does live with us.
If you believe that,
you're more stupid than you look.
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Fuck off!
If you weren't messing around
behind his back, he'd be here!
If he doesn't take me,
I'll go alone.
Just stop.
Why can't I live with him?
Because, Solomon...
- Why?
- "Why"?
Why don't you ask him?
Ask him.
(Solomon, in English) Move!
(Door opens, shuts)
(Footsteps approaching)
ls Solomon OK?
He wants to go
and live with his father.
He hates me.
I knew this would happen.
How do you mean?
Ahmed and I,
we are not married.
He...
He has a wife in the UK.
Oh, so you've...
you've always known that...
he was married?
Ahmed doesn't have
a glass ceiling above his bed,
so why should there be one
above my own?
And does Solomon know
about this?
No, he doesn't know anything.
This is a problem.
We're not married.
We're not divorced.
We are together
but also not together.
He's hardly here
and then just pops up.
No wonder the poor kid's
screwed up.
Is he...
Is he gonna leave her?
For you?
Oh. (Laughs)
Husbands never leave the wife
for the other woman.
If he was going to,
he would have done this years ago.
- But you're buying a new house together.
- No, no, no.
I'm buying it alone.
I'm not sharing that, too. So...
This place is all falling apart...
I can't stand this anymore.
What does Ahmed say about...
about her?
- Er, who? The wife?
- Mm.
Nothing.
I forbade him to talk about her.
- You're not curious?
- Of course.
I'm human.
Pakistani.
No kids.
That can all stay over there.
- He said that?
- I've never seen a picture.
- I don't care...
- He said that?
- What?
- I mean...
How... How can...
How can you share?
Knowingly?
We all break the rules
we set for ourselves in the end.
You must know him very well.
Er... What I know is that...
being with me has made him
a better husband for someone else.
This is sad for me.
But mostly for Solomon,
that he's a disappointment
as a father.

- Er, in the morning.
Thank you, Mary,
for everything, really.
You've been an amazing help.
I couldn't have done this without you.
- Oh, no.
- Oh...
We've got used to
having you around,
so maybe you can come next week
once we're settled?
Oh, I... Er... Erm...
I need to check.
OK. Anyway,
you have my number.
OK? Just call me
when you want to.
- See you soon.
- Mm.
(Geneviéve, in French)
Boys? I'm off.

(Anthony) I'll grab my bag,
I've got to go.
Bye, ma'am.
(Mary) Goodbye.

- I have to go.
- I'll call you later.
- You'd better.
- (Both chuckle)
See you.
What?

we could find something.

- What's it called again?
- Saag.
It's spinach.
A bit DIY, I'm afraid.
Though I am very impressed
with the tortilla wraps.
Who knew they'd make
such a good substitute for roti?
Mm.
You eat like my dad.
Mm, come on.
Take a little piece.
- All right.
- Mm-hmm, like that.
Just a little bit, then.
Now you use your thumb.
These two fingers. That's it.
And you just scoop it.
There, see now.
Look, you can hold it!
(Both laugh)
- (Anthony) Mm.
- (Chuckles)
You're doing very well.
You just keep going.
Did your dad, erm...
ever teach you to speak Urdu?
- Mm-hmm.
- He did?
But I understand it more
than I can speak.
(Mary) Oh.
(In Urdu) So he taught you Urdu,
but not how to eat with your hands?
What was he thinking? (Chuckles)
- (In French) Unbelievable...
- (Both laughing)
(In English) Erm, wait. Erm...
(In Urdu) You speak it well.
How did you learn?
(In English) My husband.
I learnt because I wanted to know
what his family was saying about me.
(Solomon laughs)
(In Urdu)
Does your mum speak it, too?
- Oh.
Have you been to Pakistan?
(In English) Hmm. Well...
I have been
to Lahore and Karachi.
Hmm.
And then,
when I first got married,
my husband, he took me to his home village
just outside Islamabad.
I'd like to go one day.
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
Sol?
Mary, you... You're still here.
Yes, erm...
He was hungry.
And I had a free evening.
I didn't mind.
- Did you cook this?
- Yes.
(In French) It's delicious.
Oh. (Chuckles)
(In English) I should have stayed in,
after all.
(In French) I see you've helped yourself
to my wine.
(In English) May I join you?
Oh, would you...
Would you like some yourself?
No, no.
I've eaten. Thank you.
(Pouring wine)
(In French)
Have you spoken to your father?
Yes.
What did he say?
(in English) Did he say
where he's been all this time?
He hasn't picked up my calls.
And I'm worried.
(In French) He said
I could go and live with him.
He said what? You're lying.
(Solomon) I'm not lying.
That's that, I'm going.
(Geneviéve laughing)
Needs more salt.
(In English) Why are you
criticising her food?
She's right in front of you.
Do you feel inferior?
- Because I said her cooking was good.
- Don't be stupid.
She's done me a favour
feeding you.
- (Solomon, in French) Yeah, right.
- Listen...
Why are you so hateful
towards me?
(In English) I can't wait
for my father to arrive tomorrow.
(Genevieve) Oh, we're gonna have
a discussion, the three of us, for sure.
(In French)
Actually, that's all I'm waiting for.
Sometimes you behave
like a totally selfish child.
You're really behaving
like a little bastard.
(In English) Nice.
Now I'm a little bastard.
I can hardly accuse her
of being a liar on that.
(In French) If I'm a bastard,
then what are you?
You're a whore!
I dare you to say that again.

I didn't want to know about you.
I did.
But if I knew who you were...
what you looked like...
I would have gone mad.
I was jealous of you.
That he wouldn't leave you for me.
I convinced myself
I was fine with sharing...
because I always thought
that I had the better half of him.

(Footsteps descending)
(Ahmed) 'Hi, Mary.
'I'm not sure
what day you'll get this,
'but today is Monday
29th August, 1974.
'It's 3:00 in the morning here,
'so I think it must be 10 o'clock
where you are?
'Everyone's sleeping in the courtyard
because it's so hot. (Chuckles)
'It smells amazing.
'All of the lemons
are coming out on the trees.'
(Crickets chirping)
'Can you hear that?
'It's crickets.
'Hey.
'If there's a full moon here,
'does that mean there's a full moon
where you are, too?
'I wonder what you look like right now.
'Oh, I think the tape's running out.
'Keep looking up.'
Where did you find that?
(Recorder clicks off)
It was... It was in the drawer.
(Breathes shakily)
(Sniffles)
(Breath shuddering)
(crying)

(Sobbing)
(Both continue crying)
(Seagulls squawking)
(In French)
Solomon, not so close, please!
(I Sombre string music playing)
(I Sombre string music
continues playing)
