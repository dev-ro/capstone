Sleep eludes me
"Today's paper, Miss Sarika."
Mother..? I've just come.
Who? oh no! No way.
Don't begin now.
I can't come to Pune now.
I'll call you at night.
okay. Bye.
I'd gone to the washer man
so I got your clothes too.
- Why did you take the trouble?
- It's no trouble at all.
- Count them. They're 8
- My hands..hold on.
Your clothes..
- Meena has gone to her
parental home. - So..?
You were cooking.
I've got a tiffin.
We could eat together.
"- Don't be formal.
- Mr. Kamdar, please leave."
or I'll have to tell
your wife about this.
- You misunderstand me.
- Not one bit.
Please go away and stop making
excuses to come to my house daily.
- Give me a minute.
- You may take an hour.
I don't mean this.
What can I do for you?
I need details of a flight
to London via Frankfurt.
Will you join me for lunch?
"Sorry, I don't go out
for lunch with strangers."
I am Karan Rathod and
your name is Sarika Vartak.
- We're no longer strangers.
- Knowing names doesn't make us pals.
But it's very important to
know names to make friends.
"Fool, you turned him down!
My God! He's so cute"
"I'd have gone with him for lunch,
breakfast and dinner if I were you."
Are you following me?
I thought you liked me..
So you followed me over here.
I'm kidding.
- We drink the same coffee.
- Half of lndia does.
Does half of lndia drink this coffee?
- Are you okay? - I chased him
because he was half my size.
Yet such people could be
carrying knives...
So you think I'm a hero?
I risked my life to get your purse.
Nobody does that for a stranger.
"lf not lunch, will you have a
cup of coffee with me? Here..?"
"- what do you do? - A little
everything, a little nothing."
Meaning?
Call you in an hour.
"Meaning stocks, shares, sensex"
My job is quite boring.
Tell me about yourself.
Do you like living alone?
- How do you know I live alone?
- 15 packets of noodles.
Either you live alone or
you have lots of kids.
Lots of kids.
Where do you stay?
In a suitcase.
I often come to Bombay for work
I live in a hotel.
"Mom is in Europe, Dad in USA.
They're divorced."
They're happy. So am l.
"Yes, tell me.."
When?
- All well? - Somewhat
and somewhat not well.
- Then..? - Then what?
He had his coffee and left.
"l too finished my coffee,
caught a bus and went home."
What..?
You..? What're you doing here?
Following you.
Been waiting for 2 hours for you
to come out so I can drop you home
Don't tell me you believe that!
I had work in the bank across.
"l saw you. Anyway, I'm going
to Juhu. Shall I give you a lift?"
So you took my advice?
- But...
- Again.
So you work in a travel agency.
My travelling is only from
home to office and back.
And weekends at Pune.
- What does your Dad do?
- He was a mining engineer.
Now he's retired.
I'll have a cup of tea
or coffee if you insist.
Who is Vidyadhar Damle?
He teaches drums in Africa.
He's my landlord.
- You really have many kids.
- Can you find me?
This..no this one..
"Tea, coffee or cold drink
What do you want?"
Actually I want to kiss you.
You asked me what
I wanted and I answered.
Not because I said this...
But because I made you angry.
- What is wrong?
- What? Nothing.
- Don't want to eat lunch?
- No.
"Miss Sarika, this is for you."
"Somebody left it
at the door, I just.."
You must've read the note.
I don't want to talk to you.
Lock up..
- Where do you want to go?
- I thought it's empty.
- It is. The meter is up
- Fare is 2 bottles.
Come on in. We'll drop you home.
"lf you won't sit in
the cab, neither will we."
- We'll walk with you.
- Step by step.
Sit in the taxi.
We hailed it for you.
- Get the cab..
- Who is he? Her Pop? - Let me see
My arm!!
Stop the cab!!
He broke my arm! Wait for me!
Come on.
- For what?
- For what??
- If you hadn't come in time..
- They were hired hoods.
They work in a beer bar.
"- What's your problem?
- You have a problem, not me."
You don't know what's true.
I broke his arm.
I'll have to pay an extra 10000
- This is no joke.
- You're joking.
Alone on the road at midnight.
What if something had happened..
Wear the seat belt.
For you.
open it.
- This is very..
- Expensive. I know.
- I can't take this.
- I'm not asking you to pay.
I'm serious. I can't take it.
I got you a gift.
I should've got you
a pen or some flowers.
So you could keep them
in the cupboard or notebook.
But you can't accept a necklace.
For me buying this
is like buying a pen.
I bought it for you.
I didn't look at the cost.
I liked it so I bought it
Shall I put it round?
- Got caught in traffic.
- Where's your luggage?
- What luggage?
- Did you come to say bye?
- Come with me.
- And my work?
India's tourism industry won't
come to a halt if you take leave.
- You're coming back on Tuesday?
- No guarantee of anything.
Who knows I might return on Sunday..
I meant next Sunday.
"No, mother. The holiday season is on."
So we have to work on Sundays
too. I'll come next week.
What's the matter? These days
Dad doesn't talk of settling me
You said you're coming on Sunday.
"l said, you can't be sure
about anything in life."
You're looking very pretty.
I'll be back.
Come in.
You could've called earlier.
I'd have made something else.
It's very good.
I can easily catch you when you lie.
Is that so?
We'll ask each other 5 questions
and the answers should be lies.
What is this?
What's the colour of your shirt?
"- Do your parents live in Pune?
- No, in Timbucktoo."
"- You work in the stock market.
- No, I'm a gangster."
- How many questions is that?
- Two.
- You lose.
- Hold it!
Let's not count this.
Let's do it again.
You have many girl friends?
You're the first girl I love.
Was..this the right answer or..
It's my turn.
"You tell me, if it's right or wrong"
It was the right answer.
Last question. Can l
stay here with you tonight?
- Yes. - okay.
I'll stay if you wish.
This was the sixth question.
What is the matter? Is it
because we're not married?
or because you don't trust me
I trust you.
- What's wrong?
- It's a rat!!
"- What? - I swear it's
a rat, I'm not joking!"
- What's the matter?
- A rat! I wondered what's wrong.
- It's not funny. Why're you
laughing? - okay. I'll find him.
- one second..
- Don't open it!!
It will come out!
What are you doing?
- There it is! - Don't kill
it! Get it out of here!
- What is this? - There's
a drain in the corner.
- He ran away hearing you scream.
- You find it funny
Why does my screaming
seem funny to you?
- Come down.
- I won't.
I'm not stepping down.
You come for 2 days
then you vanish for 4
- I don't want this. I want us..
- It's not for you.
It's for me.
So I can call you
whenever I feel like it.
"l have an off on Saturday,
I want us to go to Pune."
To my house.
No.
- Do me a favour?
- Yes.
"l have a friend, Abhijit
who lives in Nashik."
He's flying Hong Kong this evening
but first he'll come to Bombay.
He doesn't know anyone in Bombay.
Shall I send him home for 2 hours?
- I don't' have to show him
the sights? - offer him coffee.
He's your friend. I'll give
him coffee and lunch too.
I'm Abhijit. Karan..

Which airline are you flying by?
How much sugar? Two spoons?
Are you going to Hong Kong for work?
Just a minute.
Yes. In Andheri.
"Yes. okay, be there in half an hour."
"Yes, I have work...
I must leave."
I'll take it before flying..
"Gangster Prakash Sahay alias Mama

According to the crime investigation
unit of Mumbai Police Crime branch..
Prakash had come to Chandan
cinema to kill an industrialist.
Sahay alias Mama..
He was wanted in many cases
of murder and extortion.
- Your friend..
- I know.
- Did he leave anything with you?

Does Sarika Vartak live here?
Yes but she isn't home.
- Who are you?
- l..I'm Rathod.
- What's in this?
- Clothes. - open it.
No. I mean I couldn't
find the keys at home.
- Where is it?
- The key is lost.
I was going to get a duplicate made
Are you Mama's aunt?
Please talk properly.
I haven't done anything.
"How many times must I say,
I know no Mama or Sahay"
"- Everything..
- Quiet, bitch!"
Singing the same tune for 2 hours!
How did he have your address?
Under no circumstances
must you mention my name.
He was in the Wanted list.
He had to go sooner or later.
Why are you crying?
Honest..I didn't even know him.
- l..
- only slept with him or..?
Did you work for him?
This is a police station.
Crying doesn't help here.
only talking helps.
Speak...
There's somebody to see her.
I'm Sarika's friend.
- Is he also her friend?
- He's my brother.
I know Sarika for a year and a half
You are mistaken. Really..
Forget about her.
Talk about yourself.
You know her for a year and a half..
That means you too are involved
She only works with that
girl in a travel agency.
only work. That's why she's here.
Friendship is way off.
She hardly knows her.
I thought it's just
a case of accident..
Shut up. Don't waste madam's time.
She has lots of work.
Where's the food?
Give us some food.
Shut up. Is this a hotel?
It's a government cow shed.
Bitch!!
What are you staring at?
Never seen blood?
Come. Somebody is here to see you.
Your lawyer. Karan sent me.
- Where's Karan?
- He's busy in some work.
- Urgent work.. What?
- I don't know.
He said he'll come and tell.
Please sit here.
I'll explain.
Karan met this Mama or
whatever a few months ago.
He said he was Abhijit. Had
a grape business near Nashik.
All dealings in grape
business is in cash.
Karan was investing his money.
They had become friendly.
Who knew he was a gangster.
He had neither grape nor Pop.
Did the police trouble you?
The police think I'm with
that man Prakash Sahay
- Where is Karan?
- He's in Bangalore.
Let me tell you..the facts are
we have done nothing.
Nothing will happen to you.
We'll go to court. Let the police
say anything. You don't worry.
"The judge will ask,
how did you get the suitcase?"
Tell him this Mama came to your house
And said he's your school friend
Sita or Gita's brother.
"Said, she'll call and
forcibly left the suitcase."
No call came.
You saw the news on TV.
You were taking the bag to
the police when this happened
- Sign here.
- But I was scared.
I lied to the police that..
What you said to the police
has no meaning in court.
The court needs evidence.
Which the police don't have.
We'll be home in 2 hours.
Sahay's finger prints
were found in her home.
Also some costly items.
"Mobile phone, diamond jewelry.."
She can't buy them
in her stated income.
This is her neighbour
Mr. Kamdar's statement.
He has seen them together.
Hence I can confidently say
she was Sahay's mistress.
And worked for him in the underworld
Judicial custody for 3 weeks.
Mr. Kamlesh! You said
I'd be home in 2 hours.
- Don't worry. I'll appeal...
- They're taking me to jail!
"What do you mean,
don't worry? Where is Karan?"
one minute. I'm trying his
mobile but can't reach him.
- He maybe in the flight.
- Flight..? - And who is Kamdar?
He's my neighbour. What's..
- You should've told me!
- There was nothing to tell.
- What could I say..?
- Will you decide what to say?
- No - I should know
what'll happen in court.
This is a legal matter.
Screaming will worsen it.
I'll take a date as early as possible.
We'll sue them and demand
compensation for defamation.
Come on.
It's a matter of a day or two.
Hurry up. Come on.
"1 1, 12, 13, 14.."
"16, 17, 18.."
Hurry up.
Sign and stand there.
You come forward.
Stand straight.
You're the new chick.
Want a biscuit?
Take it!
This is a great place.
You get great food.
"Listen, stay away from one woman."
She's crazy. A real bitch.
She's committed 4 murders.
There's a woman in the next
cell with a bandaged head..?
She fought with Dolly and
Dolly bit her ear off!
And spat it out. Steer clear of her.
What's your name?
And yours..?
Go to sleep. Go on.
What's the matter?
- What did you do to her?
- What did I do?
She's scared of rats.
- What's wrong?
- Scared of rats!
Get in line!
"Mother, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me."
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- But what happened?
- one small mistake..
- The gangster..
- He's not a gangster.
He was his friend. He didn't know..
What did he do? Ask her
what will she do?
What's your friend's name?
What..?
I didn't know.
- Ever heard his name?
- No.
- Ever met him?
- No.
- Simply believed your daughter.
- My daughter doesn't lie.
- Don't yell. I can hear
- The corporator has been waiting..
Ask him to sit.
You were in government service.
What was your salary?
- Rs. 9000.
- Your daughter earns 1 2000
It's enough but not in Mumbai.
Whatever you earn isn't enough here.
"Perfume bottles, cell phone.."
"Clothes, nail polish..
Where will these come from?"
They come from good families but
no father knows what the girl does.
She doesn't lie!
Work fast and you'll get thrashed!
- The lentils smell of soap.
- Then wash your hair with it.
Who is this swell babe?
She's new.
What's the name?
Name!
What did you do? What??
Answer questions.
- Leave her.
- Did I do anything to you?
Did l..? What?
What did I say? Leave her.
She's not answering me.
Get moving.
Move off.
See you later.
Come here.
- What's your name?
- You two are always out.
- Go away.
- We're going.
"Madam Pramila, they've come.
Sir wants you to talk to them."
"Carry on, I'm coming."
It's a matter of 2 weeks.
Everything will be fine.
"Till then, take care."
- Keep this.
- What is it?
Razor. You'll need it.
- Why do I need it?
- This is a jail. You'll need it.
- But I don't want it. I..
- As you wish.
Who is Premila?
Sadubhai's wife.
Don't you know him?
Where have you come from?
He was a notorious gangster.
He was bumped off by a rival gang.
Pramila killed both and came here.
She runs the gang from here.
She's very influential.
outside and inside.
She can get out when
she wants but it's safe here.
Police and gangsters
both can lose their lives.
When is Pramila's hearing?
- Why?
- Just asking.
- Come on. - Where?
- Just come.
"l said, come on."
- Where are you taking me..?
- Quietly come with me.
Go in there.
I met him at a party.
A friend introduced us.
I had no idea he was
part of the underworld.
"I'm calling all my contacts,
all my friends everyday."
I'll get you out of here very soon.
My entire work centers
around my reputation.
"lf my name comes up in this,
years of effort will be wasted."
Nobody will trust me.
Everything will be ruined.
I don't know how to say this but..
"for my sake, bear it
for another few days."
What a man. Left his wife in jail..
- And is free...
- No. Don't say that.
He told me he's trying his best.
"ln a few days, he'll have me out."
Good. This place isn't for you.
- ordered anything?
- No.
Who is it?
Got scared?
- Eight million? - Yes. Tomorrow.
- Where? - London.
Need 8. In London.
Note the number.
Everything is fine.
He'll call you.
Heard you have a girl friend
What's the problem?
- There's no problem.
- of course.
Her father is moving court.
He's got a date next week.
- So?
- What does that mean?
She's charged with MCoCA.
She can't hold out.
What if she mentions your
name during interrogation?
And if she admits to the crime?
But why will I confess
when I didn't do anything?
The police have lots
of evidence against you.
You'll go in even if
you don't confess to the crime.
"lf you do admit, the
matter goes to the judge."
And the judge is a good man.
Tell him you knew the man a little
You did small jobs for him.
Tell him you're sorry.
Shed some tears.
The judge will look at your record.
You are educated.
Belong to a good family.
You have an honest job.
He'll give you a warning.
He'll sentence you for 10-15 days
but you've spent a month in jail.
So there's no problem in that.
"Tell you something,
strictly between us.."
Judge Saklecha showed
this path to Karan.
Karan wants you to be out
as soon as possible.
- So what do we do?
- l..
I want to confess.
Are you admitting on your own?
Yes.
You're from a good family.
You are educated.
You even had a good job.
I can be lenient with those who
get into crime due to circumstances.
You did this of your own
will only out of greed.
I have no sympathy for you.
7 years of rigorous imprisonment.
No parole.
Judge..sir..
Why don't you say something?
"Just a minute, there's a mistake.."
Just a minute. Please.
"Your Honour, just a minute.
There's some misunderstanding."
Hold on. There's
some misunderstanding.
He hoodwinked you!
Now do you understand?
He's connection to the underworld.
He would've been trapped
if you'd mentioned him.
He framed you to save his skin.
She wants to meet you.
Sweetheart is threatening..
She'll tell the police about you.
What will you tell the police?
That Karan involved you?
Try and understand this.
The police have no record on Karan.
They might possibly
make inquiries. So..?
What will it prove?
That you slept with Karan?
Like you slept with Sahay
and God knows how many others?
Sleeping with you doesn't
make Karan a gangster!
I'm explaining to her.
I can understand the
state of your mind.
So I don't mind you threatening
about mentioning me to the cops.
I can't say much
for I am helpless.
I know you'll face
difficulties in jail.
"But believe me, in a few days
you'll get accustomed to it."
It's not as if I'm not
trying to get you out.
This judge turned out to be
a fraud. others won't be.
"ln months or a year,
he'll be transferred."
A new judge will be appointed
We'll reopen the case.
You should be brave. Be strong.
Who?
"We're not allowed to call any
prisoner here like this, Madam."
Who's dead?
Her father?
Wash these too.
Hey! Wash the clothes!
Let me go.
Hey water-baby... haven't you
heard me? Damn you!
Throw that knife away!
The wardens are coming!
out of my way! What the
hell is going on here?
Gomti... what have you
been upto?
You there... come here!
What's happening here...?
Speak up!
Madam... it was that...
How would I know?
I was washing my clothes.
one good thing surely comes out of
the betrayal Karan has handed you.
It has given you strength.
There's a tiger hidden in everyone.
You need someone to provoke it.
You can now spend seven years
here in peace.
I have no intention of staying here.
Meaning?
I want to get out of this place.
Will you help me?
What are you going to do?
Kill him?
Not so easily.
Carry that... don't just watch.
- Careful.
They're asking me to go to Sangli.
How will l?
My husband and kid are here.
I asked them to send Asha.
She has no children.
But they ask me to either
go away or quit the job
"That's not fair, is it?
Are you hearing me?"
Don't worry. I'll look into it.
Go on.
A fire's broken out!
Someone fetch some water!
Hurry! Get some water!
A fire has broken out!
A fire has broken out
in the kitchen!
Go!
Fetch water! From there!
What are you doing...?
Get back... get some water!
Move in.
Move it guys.
No meeting today.
What...? But how?
A fire broke out in the prison.
"A few women slipped out,
and she was one of them too."
That's good... good for her.
I'm in a meeting.
I'll call you later.
Is everything else all right?
- I've bought a new car.
Contessa. White
When will this be done?
"Hello, sister...
are you okay?"
Is Bandya there?
Pramila's like a sister to me.
"Should you need anything... anywhere,
just phone me."
Where is Karan?
Are you out of your mind?
- Where is Karan?
I'm not sparing you!
I'll have you hanged!
I'm not sparing you!
I'll ask you one last time.
Where is Karan?
They say he was drunk
and fell off the balcony.
No one saw anything. They think it's
a case of accident or suicide.
Suicide?
- Yes.
Why would he commit suicide?
He has been killed by someone.
I had told him to take
Nagrath's case lightly.
And those guys of the estate. I wonder
how many guys he caused losses to.
You mean one of those guys
have bumped him off?
Yes. But who was it?
In which room is Mr Karan Rathod
put up?
one moment.
Room number 3023.
Would you like to talk to him?
No thanks. Would 3022 or 3024
be available by any chance?
"one moment, ma'am."
"I'm so sorry, ma'am.
Those rooms are not available."
But you can have the room
bang opposite his.
Will do.
"Would you fill up this form, please?
- Sure."
"I'm okay, Mother."
"No, I'm not in Bombay. I..."
I can't tell you right now.
I'm with a friend.
"You don't know her, Mother."
"But what have you done, Sarika?
- No point in discussing all that now."
"You mustn't cry, please. You can
do that much for me, can't you?"
"Please... talk to me, Mother."
From Delhi. Used a pre-paid
card to call.
Under a fictitious name.
I've been noticing you for 2 days.
My name is Krishna Varghese.
"lf you work for my album, I can
make you famous overnight."
What do you do by the way?
I won't take much of your time.
My studio's nearby. In the city.
What were you saying?
- I can introduce you everywhere.
I can send your photographs
to the top agencies.
"A moment of ecstasy,
and a sweet high"
Was it me...?
or was it someone else?
"Unblemished, innocent,
blameless..."
Iike a nymph from paradise...
she took the breath away
There used to be a beautiful woman
So what went wrong...
"with the beautiful woman
who once was?"
Where is she...?
"the beautiful woman
who once was?"
Killer eyes...
black-hearted...
"the footfalls, I could not hear"
the silence was deafening...
eyes shed tears...
"l kept crying,
while he laughed"
"There was once
a beautiful woman"
What happened...?
"of the beautiful woman
who once was"
Where is she...?
"the beautiful woman
who once was?"
What occurred in a moment?
"My face was lost
in obscurity"
Fires rage in my eyes
"My lips are firm
in resolve"
"The one that was,
has gone into hiding..."
"who's this...?
No, it isn't me"
"There used to be
a beautiful woman"
Is it necessary to meet
so late in the night?
"Not later, right now.
Sir wants you right now."
What are you doing? What?
- Let me make a call.
Don't touch me.
- You're going with us right now.
Move it!
Karan... Iet's go.

What is the problem?
Karan is here.
Sit down.
Why're you so serious?
Smile
Has he gone to sleep?
Go
Go upstairs.
"Make your men see reason, Sanjeev.
They have no manners."
"l told them to drag you here,
wherever and whatever state you were in"
So you've found time to spare
from the girl?
Has my work been done or not?
- No.
Why not?
"lt'll be done, Sanjeev.
Nagar-bhai took ill and..."
To hell with your Nagar-bhai.
- I had to take him to the hospital.
He's not dead. Is he?
How much have you been paid till now?
- Two.
I didn't pay you that amount
to listen to stories.
You were paid to do a job.
When will the job be done?
In fifteen or twenty days.
- Fifteen? or twenty?
Twenty.
"For twenty days,
I won't telephone you"
"Even after twenty days,
I won't."
"All right, Sanjeev. What else?"
How's the elder brother?
He's very happy with you.
Everything's been sorted out.
Give me a smile at least now.
"Yes... I told you,
I'd be free in half an hour."
I'm coming over to pick you up.
What will we do so late in the night?
Watch TV.
"Yes, brother? He's upstairs"
Karan has gone down just now.
Really? I'll take a look.
Have you gone to sleep?
Please come here immediately.
Karan has... killed Sanjeev.
Marfatia's money is also missing.
I want Karan.
"The receptionist has arrived, madam.
The one you wanted to talk to?"
Did you see her
coming or going with anyone?
"Did she receive any calls?
- No, ma'am."
"one thing, ma'am. When she arrived,
she specially requested..."
for a room next to Mr Rathod's.
one Mr Karan Rathod.
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Who are they?
What's up?
"What happened?
- You ask that, you sonofabitch!"
What happened?
- You've killed Sanjeev!
What?
- You've killed Sanjeev!
Who killed Sanjeev?
- You!
Cut the crap!
- No crap! It's the truth!
"Minutes after you left,
we found him dead"
"Believe me, brother.
I haven't killed Sanjeev."
Lies!
- Why would I kill him?
Lies! He's lying!
"Look in Sanjay's house. If not there,
check out Nautiyal's godown."
Why would I kill him?
What happened?
What?!
Where's Bilal right now?
Bilal?
"I'm shocked, brother."
He's gone insane.
Where will he go? Must be
somewhere here in Delhi
We'll find him. And fix him
The situation is very bad.
Just run away.
But why must I run away?
I've not done anything.
Bilal is the one who stole the money.
That sonofa...
To hell with all that.
Save your life. Just run away.
Take my advise. Get out of Delhi.
Any news?
- I've come to ask you.
Any calls?
- I called so many places...
there's no trace of him.
But we're not sparing him.
You looked everywhere?
- Everywhere I could.
Brother had called.
He sounded very upset.
What were you guys doing there?
You killed a goat in the bathroom?
All I know is that he left
this place in Patel's car.
"You know me well, sir.
Make them understand that l..."
"Yes, I knew they had
a fight going, but..."
I'm at the airport.
I can't believe this!
How have you been? I've been looking
for you for so many days!
What happened?
- Nothing... what are you doing here?
"l escaped from there, Karan.
With half a dozen other girls..."
"And you once told me that
you work in Delhi, didn't you?"
"Karan, I called every Rathod
in the telephone directory, but..."
And then I wondered
whether you were around at all.
Whether you were in Delhi
or somewhere else in lndia.
I wondered how I'd find you.
And l...
I can't believe it that
I'd find you here like this
You must be happy too...?
What is the matter?
There are men after me.
They want to kill me.
What...?
- It's a misunderstanding.
I'll be there in an hour.
What happened?
"Your place at Hauz Khas?
C'mon, it's only for a day or two!"
"No, I can't go there.
And you know that well."
"Sarika, where are you staying?"
"What is the matter, Karan?
- Nothing."
Kamlesh called to say that
you had run away from jail.
Didn't you contact me?
- I did.
"l called Kamlesh's house so many
times, but no one takes the phone."
Then I got to know that he had
fallen off the balcony and died.
He didn't die on his own.
He was killed.
Killed? Who killed him?
The same guys who want to kill me.
"After you went to jail, I got
trapped with the underworld."
Kamlesh and I were gathering
evidence to save you.
They got to know and
they killed Kamlesh.
They've framed me for
someone's murder too.
I can't even go to
the police now.
"So what are you
going to do, Karan?"
That which I must do to
save my skin. I'll have to
"I'm with you, Karan."
"Having spent time in jail,
I've learnt to fight back too."
A jail-mate got me this place.
It's absolutely safe.
Yes? You've done it for me?
It's Bilal who killed him and
vanished with the money.
They'll say anything!
I want Bilal all alone. That's it.
"What will you do with
where I am, Amrish?"
Can you do it for me?
or can't you?
Who are these men
that are following you?
"I'll explain everything
to you later, Sarika."
"You have a cell-phone charger?
- oh yes, I'll give it to you."
"Karan, for a little while..."
can't you forget all this?
Give him the phone.
Hurry up.
"Call his place, go there
or do what you will..."
all I want to know is
where is Bilal.
"How many men does he have?
You can do this much, can't you?"
Call me back soon.
"Where will you go, Karan?"
I have a friend in Jaipur.
They have a huge mansion.
"We can get a car, money...
everything there."
"Let's go someplace faraway
from here, Karan. okay?"
Yes?
What?!
"You hate me.
- What... are you saying, Karan?"
You will go to Bilal and
tell him that you hate me.
He will believe what you say.
You will tell him
where I am hiding.
I want Bilal all alone.
And only you can do it for me.
But who is Bilal?
The owner of three factories.
A garment exporter.
But he's definitely
an underworld man.
The bodies we found in the hotel
were his men.
But what has all this to do
with your case?
Where will I find Bilal?
I want to meet Mr Bilal.
Yes?
- I want to have a word with him.
There's a girl outside.
She says she knows where Karan is.
Where is Karan?
Sit down.
And what did you think?
Your men could kill me?
or that I'd run away from Delhi
out of fear?
It was a fantastic move.
But you picked on the wrong man.
"Where is Marfatia's money, Bilal?"
"What?
- Money, rupees... where is it?"
You're insane!
Hurry up!
- How'd I know where the money is
You don't know where the money is?
- You must tell me.
You're the one who
has the money.
"l don't have much time, Bilal."
I see. You're high on pot.
You're the one who killed Sanjeev.
And you stole the money!
"lf I had killed Sanjeev,
why would I come here?"
Think about it!
Why would I come here?
If you haven't killed Sanjeev...
"it means there was someone else
present there, that night"
Who? Who...?
- How'd I know who?
Let me talk to brother.
Let me telephone him.
I'll tell him that you
didn't commit the murder
I'll kill you and the money
won't be any good for you
Give me the money and run away.
I'm giving you a chance.
The money is not with me!
- So you won't talk?
You won't tell me?
I'll tell you... I will.
Get up... move it!
Nobody's answering the phone at
Bilal's. Check what the problem is.
"At once, brother."
Hold it!
"Mr Karan Rathod, we find dead-bodies
everywhere you go."
"l don't know anything, madam.
I had come here to meet Mr Bilal."
But I found these bodies.
And then you arrived suddenly...
and I thought...
- Where is Sarika?
Sarika who? I don't know.
Don't you live together in the hotel?
- In the hotel?
No.
- Why?
Isn't it living together when
you stay in opposite rooms?
Remember now?
Sarika who? The one who ran away
from the Bombay prison?
The same Sarika who
murdered Kamlesh Mathur.
Why would Sarika
murder Kamlesh Mathur?
Isn't it living together when
you stay in opposite rooms?
The same Sarika who
murdered Kamlesh Mathur.
Killed? Who killed him?
"lf you haven't killed Sanjeev,
it means..."
there was someone else present there
that night.
Are you all right?
- I'm all right.
Although I felt for a moment
that we'd never meet again.
"Karan, we must get out
of this place immediately."
"one second, Sarika.
I need to talk to you."
"You faced a lot of problems because
of me, but you're still helping me"
Why?
"I'm in love with you, Karan."
Will you marry me?
"Karan, the police
are after me..."
and you're being followed by...
We must leave.
You didn't answer my question.
- Karan...?
"You love me, don't you?
- oh yes, Karan."
"We'll go to Nepal. And from there,
we'll go away to Europe."
My mother lives there.
I haven't met her in years.
I want to meet her with you.
only tell me... where the money is
I know
"Where is the money, Sarika?"
Where is the money?
Where is it?
I won't ask again.
Where is the money?
How did you kill Kamlesh?
And how did you kill Sanjeev?
Quite a revelation
you've turned out to be.
"That you could be so spicy,
I never realised when I had you."
"The first time I met you,
I only wanted to sleep with you."
"But I now think, I must
really fall in love once"
Where is the money?
What's this? Huh?
You wanted to kill me?
So here you are. Kill me.
You've learnt so much in jail.
Take it!
No?
Where is the money?
"Tell me where the money is, Sarika.
Else, I'll kill you."
Burnt
Loudly!
I burnt it!
- Lies! You are lying!
I'm speaking the truth!
I'm the one who killed Sanjeev!
"l took the money, ran away from
there and burnt the money!"
"Because I knew,
they wouldn't spare you!"
"l wanted them to catch you,
to follow you..."
"to torture you, to put you
through misery..."
And so you burnt the money?
- Yes!
Have you gone mad?
- I went mad... in jail!
"I'm sorry, Karan.
But I've burnt the money."
"What can I do now, Karan? What?
I'll do anything you say!"
I had gone mad with rage!
Please don't kill me!
"I'll do anything you say, Karan.
Anything..."
This is exactly what you
will go and tell Nanda.
She went to jail because of me.
So she wanted revenge from me.
And poor Sanjeev
had to lose his life.
Speak up! Tell brother!
Speak!
- Sir...
"sir, I haven't killed anyone."
I haven't killed anyone.
I was in love with this man.
But he was with another woman in
the hotel. He drove me out...
Let her speak.
I was returning Mumbai. He suddenly
landed at my place last night...
and said he wanted a place
to hide.
He said he had ended up
killing someone.
"That the underworld was after him.
Karan, please..."
"Brother, she's lying!"
Lies!
And then he said
that if I took the rap...
he'd give me a lot of money.
"And when I refused to do it,
he tied me up and brought me here."
Save me from him! Please!
She's the one who killed Kamlesh.
The Bombay police is after her!
You can telephone and find out.
Who Kamlesh?
"l didn't even know
the gentleman, sir."
Why would I kill him?
This man...
She's talking any nonsense
and you're listening to her!
"Ask her where the money is!
She says, she has burnt it!"
"Burnt it...? Why would anyone
burn anyone's money, sir?"
"Have you gone mad, Karan?
- I'll slit your tongue!"
Why would anyone burn money?
Has this man gone mad...?
"Enough!
- Save me from this madman, sir!"
Save me from him!
- This one here is her gun.
I guarantee it. This is the gun
that killed Sanjeev.
Why would she kill my brother
to extract revenge from you?
Because she's crazy!
- Where is Marfatia's money?
Ask her! Don't ask me!
You will die if anyone opens fire.
So listen carefully to me.
If I had killed Sanjeev
and stolen the money...
I'd have been in Europe right now.
Not here!
I have not killed your brother.
She has!
"She's the one who stole the money,
not me!"
Ask her!
She has escaped.
She has run away!
Brother! The police!
Come on out! Quick!
Take a left.
"The next slug will
rip through your skull, Karan"
Take a U-turn.
"What's all this, Sarika?
- Quietly walk."
Go on.
What are you doing...?
What is all this?
I thought about you
in jail everyday.
What am I to do with you?
"Now look, Sarika. What I did
to you was very wrong..."
Mere death would be
far too little for you.
I had to search so much
to find this place.
"Sarika, undo this lock,."
Miles away from the city.
Nobody comes here.
You remember...?
I used to be scared of rats.
"Have you gone mad, Sarika?
Where did the rats come in from?"
You used to laugh.
- Untie me!
You used to laugh.
"ln jail, I was rid of all the fear."
I'm not scared of anything anymore.
I ask for your forgiveness
for whatever has happened.
You think I can't
get out of this place?
Karan's 1 10 million.
I've done what I had to.
Now you can do
what you want to.
