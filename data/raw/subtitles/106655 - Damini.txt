'There is a higher court
than courts of justice...
...and that is the court
of conscience.
It supersedes all
other courts. '
Our film, Damini, is based on
*this statement by Mahatma Gandhi.
No! No!
No!
Go!
No! No! No!
No!
What happened?
Are you scared?
Why do you feel scared here?
Huh?
What happened?
Nobody's here. Why?
- They've gone home.
Yes, they've all gone home.
You want to go home? - Yes.
With whom?
Mother.
Mother won't come.
She said they won't
take you home.
Why have they brought you here?
Tell me. Why have they
brought you here?
They say I'm not well.
I'm alright.
What alright? Why do you have
color on your hands?
Huh? What's all this?
I didn't. They...
I'm hurt too.
Where do you stay?
Don't remember, right?
I know... - Know what?
I'll tell you tomorrow. - Why
tomorrow? Tell me now!
It's very far. - What?
It's very far.
It's far? Okay, okay.
Prepare for shocks.
Where are you taking me, Dilip?
Let's go to the hotel. We'll
discuss the board meeting.
That'll be done. I've
prepared for it.
Come. The show will start.
*-What's there in Nasik? What show?
I know you've seen big
shows in Mumbai.
You've seen the world.
But if you see the dance here,
you'll be stunned. - Come on.
I swing without my beloved...
...how do I forget my promise?
I swing without my beloved...
...how do I forget my promise?
I feel like flying and
touching the sky.
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.
My love, I've got
you in my heart.
I swing without my beloved...
...how do I forget my promise?
I've suffered for many years.
Don't torment me anymore.
These distances say, hug me.
These eyes yearned for you.
You don't know dear, how my
days and nights passed.
The flowers have become young.
The weather is lovely.
They've brought a new
life, don't go.
I swing without my beloved...
...how do I forget my promise?
I swing without my beloved...

I feel like flying and
touching the sky.
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.
My love, I've got
you in my heart.
I swing without my beloved...
...how do I forget my promise?
My heart has craves for
your love every moment.
My dream destination
is far away, still.
My heart has craves for
your love every moment.
My dream destination
is far away, still.
I'm so Ionely. I am a
friend of memories.
I'm now a riddle. Come to me.
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.
My love, I've got
you in my heart.
I swing without my beloved...

Wow! What a dance!
Nice dance, wasn't it? - What a
*girl! What a dancer! What a dance!
And Amir? - He was good.
But she was... wow!
Let's do this. Let's meet
and congratulate her.
Come on, that discussion...
- What meeting?
Congratulating a new artiste
increases their confidence.
You come with me. Come on.
Amir sir, thanks a lot.
You spared time from
your busy schedule.
You came to this school's
charity program.
Look. - We're really
grateful to you.
I'm grateful to you, that
you gave me this chance.
We work daily for ourselves.
But when we get a chance to
work for charity show...
...it feels good.
One feels at peace. - It's
your greatness.
Thanks a lot, Amir.
Due to your presence,
the show was great.
Otherwise KT and I... - No,
what are you saying?
You were the life of the show.
You dance very well.
In fact, an artiste like you
should be in the film industry.
Yes. - Lf you say, I
can recommend you.
Films? No.
I won't be able to act.
I manage to do what my
teacher taught me...
...after a lot of scolding.
Even then, I make mistakes.
And when I get a chance, I take
*part in charity shows like these.
I'm happy with this.
That's how she is.
She's good. She's
good as she is.
Please come. - Sure.
Don't you know how to talk?
- What else should I have said?
The dance was good, right?
I swing without my beloved...
Amir, congratulations!
- Thank you. Hello.
Meet him. Mr. Shekhar Gupta.
- Hello. - Hello.
Owner of Gupta and Sons.
You did a great job. - Thank you.
I'm your ardent fan.
I've seen your 'Dil' (film),
22 times. - Ok.
When is your 'Andaz Apna
Apna' releasing?
It'll come very soon.
Please make it soon. - Yes.
Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Mr. Gupta, bye-bye.
Bye-bye. See how...
This happens because
of you. - Me?
Of course. You just
keep chattering.
I keep chattering? - Then do I?
Yes, you do it. - You do it.
Okay, I do it.
Devika! - Oh, Birju.
Devika! Is it set? Our
affair. - What is set?
Not to you. I'm talking to...
- Why do ask repeatedly?
Didn't I say once? - No,
I mean... - Enough!
I... shall I come... - What's he
saying? - Come. - What's set?
Shanti!
Dad... dad, Shanti...
Come child.
Children shouldn't
stay. Come on.
Come on.
Damini! Come on.
Come.
This is how girls are.
They should be married
before they mature.
What did Shanti want to prove
with this suicide?
Will she be disgraced
any less now?
The poor father.
He had met day before.
He was asking what to do.
He couldn't arrange for
money for dowry.
I say, no matter how
poor a father is...
...he won't marry his daughter
off to a useless guy.
Whatever you say.
There are two young
daughters at home...
...and time is passing by. - As if
I don't understand anything!
I'm just twiddling my thumbs!
Only you're worried
about it, not me!
Ask anyone... - All I can do is
grovel at people's feet now!
There's dowry, relatives,
horoscope.
Aren't they important too?
Isn't checking the family
important too?
You just keep rattling
all the time!
I've said so many times.
Get poison for me!
I'll die! Just because
I am a mother!
Why should you die?
I should die!
I'm useless, right?
I sired daughters but couldn't
marry them off till now.
I'll lie down on the railway
tracks and end the story!
Run the house with my pension!
Marry your daughters off!
I'm going with Birju tonight.
With Birju? Where?
Mumbai.
His relative has
a factory there.
On going there we... - Are
you crazy, sister?
You got fooled by that
drunkard Birju?
What else does he do?
Lying, watching films, gambling.
But it's also possible that
he'll change after marriage.
I want to give life a chance,
Chhoti (little one).
Not a chance, you're punishing
it, sister.
It may be a punishment.
But by doing this father's
burden will be reduced.
I want to live, Chhoti.
Won't you help me?
But sister... - Please, Chhoti.
Write a letter, sister. - Yes.
She told you last night,
why didn't you tell me?
Sister hasn't done
anything wrong.
She has disgraced me
in the community!
What community are
you talking about?
Which one?
Has anyone from the community
come to our help so far?
Yes, one did. Your
Lakshmi Narayan.
Like a great sympathizer,
he came to marry sister.
He has two daughters
of sister's age.
Old, shameless man! Lecherous!
And that Ram Mohan.
He had got engaged to sister
in the community's presence.
And then he broke it. Why?
Just because of dowry.
Did anyone intervene?
You had pleaded so much.
Mother had even held his feet!
No one said anything.
Your community stood
and watched quietly!
Community!
You care for such lowly people
who can't do anything for us...
...who're not bothered about us!
This is what it is.
Caught in the mess of dowry,
*community, relatives, horoscope...
...the girl remains unmarried.
Whether she marries or not
is for me to bother about.
I'm the guardian of this house.
I understand everything. - Yes,
you understand everything!
You don't understand what
a girl goes through.
Shanti's father didn't
understand either.
That's why last night, Shanti...
Thank God, dad...
...sister did no such thing.
Whatever your sister did,
she has ruined us!
She's dead for this
family from today!
Sister has gone to live, dad!
She wants to live.
And she will live!
Gupta Mills, Gupta Industries,
Gupta and Sons.
These are names which have
*carved a niche in the whole country.
It is great news for all of us...
...that Mr. Kedarnath Gupta's
elder son, Mr. Shekhar Gupta...
...is setting up another
project in Nasik.
Thank you. - A small gift
from all of us.
Thank you. Thank you. - Sir, I
wish you'd say a few words...
I... what do I say?
I'm sure that as usual, I'll get
your support in future too.
Actually, my family is linked
to this city since ages.
But now... now I feel a relation
is about to be established.
A deep relationship.
Hello, Shekhar. - Yes,
mom, tell me.
Where were you last evening?
Don't ask where I was
last evening...
...and what happened
with me, mom.
What's it, Shekhar,
are you alright?
I am but I'm not.
Mr. Bajaj is here.
Here, speak with him.
I couldn't speak with her, mom.
Pray that I meet her, speak with
her, then speak again...
...and keep speaking.
What happened? Disconnected?
It got disconnected. - I see.
Don't know why he
was blabbering.
When one doesn't marry at the
right time, one does falter.
Right, Gupta. - You're
experienced.
Look at him. He's younger
to Shekhar.
But since he's married,
he's so happy.
Uncle, you...
I say, get Shekhar married soon.
My daughter will handle
the rest. Right uncle?
Shekhar and Lucy are
made to order pair.
They'll marry and Gupta and
Bajaj will have made it!
What happened? What happened
to my daughter?
What happened? - Some
tea was spilt...
Insolent! You spill hot tea!
Get me some ice, please.
Ice! Get ice!
Why are you staring!
Throw her out!
Illiterate, fool!
Apply some ointment.
Some ointment.
Why are you staring, idiot? Go!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
sister-in-law.
The thing is, I can't bear
something happening to Lucy.
She doesn't have a mother.
Now I only wish that she comes
here as a daughter-in-law.
Ever since I saw you, dear...
...I can't say how
restless I am.
Ever since I saw you, dear...
...I can't say how
restless I am.
Ever since I have
loved you, dear...
...I can't say how
restless I am.
At first glance, you've
cast such a spell...
...that I've lost my senses
and control on my heart.
At first glance, you've
cast such a spell...
...that I've lost my senses
and control on my heart.
I'm scared to think that...
...I might become
a crazy lover.
Ever since I've desired
you, dear...
...I can't sleep and
there's no peace.
Ever since I saw you, dear...
...I can't say how
restless I am.
You've stolen my sleep.
Restlessness torments
me a lot.
You've stolen my sleep.
Restlessness torments
me a lot.
When I think of you,
a pang is aroused.
Ever since I've
got you, dear...
...I dream day and night.
Ever since I have
loved you, dear...
...I can't say how
restless I am.
Ever since I saw you, dear...
...I can't say how
restless I am.
Ever since I have
loved you, dear...
...I can't say how
restless I am.
Brother.
Does Ms. Damini stay
here somewhere?
Damini... - There she is.
Where? - Why don't you
send him to school?
He's always sitting here.
He doesn't go, what do
I do? - Why doesn't he?
You don't go? You don't?
Here, madam. - How will you be
an officer without studying?
Send him to me, I'll
set him right.
Shall I give you a
kilo of sweets?
Yes, taste them. - No.
Made in pure clarified butter.
What happened to my daughter?
I'll give you a kilo
of sweet balls too.
Sir, people come from far
for Mewalal's sweets.
And they go straight to the
hospital on eating them!
Didn't the kids fall ill after
*eating the sweets last week? - Damini...
...what are you saying?
These were the ones.
- She's very naughty.
Six kids. - I'll tell
your father.
Are you spoiling my
business? - Yes.
And if you don't stop
this business...
...I'll put up a board outside.
Beware of Mewalal's
adulterated sweets.
I'm speaking the truth.
Only flies eat these.
Come, I'll show you a nice shop.
Damini! You'll see. One day,
*this truth will prove costly to you.
Is it a sin to speak
the truth? - What?
Tell me. - No.
No one speaks it.
Isn't it? - Yes.
There's something wrong
everywhere. Isn't there? - Yes.
Even then, everyone
is quiet. Please.
The priest at the temple
opposite our house...
...sells the coconut offered
there to the shop.
The same coconut is offered
and sold, offered and sold.
Offered and sold... - But
no one says anything.
Everyone is quiet. It just
goes on as it is.
And if I say something,
my sister scolds me.
Devika. - Devika.
She says I talk too much.
Do I speak a lot?
No, you don't talk
a lot. - That's it.
People here talk a lot, but
not where they should.
That's why all this is
happening. - What's happening?
Who are talking to? Who is he?
Dad... - Hello. - Yes,
I... he... sweets...
Mr. Pedhe? - No.
No, my name is Shekhar.
- Shekhar Pedhe.
No, Shekhar Gupta. My name
is Shekhar Gupta.
Is it? - Yes. - How
come you're here?
I... this Gupta Industries,
Gupta Mills... - Yes.
This Gupta Establishment... - That
is Mr. Kedarnath Gupta's. - Yes.
I'm his elder son.
Oh! - Yes.
I had come here for the
company's work and...
I had seen your show. - Really?
Yes. You dance beautifully.
Very beautiful.
I want to marry your daughter.
What? - Yes.
If you want, daddy
will talk to you.
Why he? I will...
But why do you want to marry?
What? - No... I mean why do
you want to marry me?
You don't even know me and
just now... then how did...
Ms. Damini, sometimes, even
*after ages, no relation is formed...
...and there's no acquaintance.
And sometimes, in one meeting,
one feels as if...
...one knows the other since
ages. Right? - Yes.
Don't you feel that?
A postmaster's daughter will
now be our daughter-in-law.
But you... just see
her once, mom.
Shut up! Relatives are already
wagging tongues.
The younger one is married, the
elder one still hasn't. - Yes.
People don't know that the young
one didn't get married.
He was forced to.
Since these two had
had fun in college.
In this situation, if we
hadn't accepted Deepa...
...her life would've been ruined.
But Deepa is the Agarwal
family's daughter.
She's not an ordinary
man's daughter.
Mom, Damini is from
a poor family...
...but her thoughts, her nature...
...she has a lot of virtues, mom.
A lot of virtues. - That's it?
You've understood everything
in one meeting? - Yes, mom.
My heart believes that Damini...
Damini is the one.
Mom, please. - Damini?
Is this a name? - Why?
Compare her to Mr. Bajaj's
daughter. Lucy! - Uncle!
Will you keep quiet now?
I think we should meet the girl.
- Oh thank you, dad. Thank you.
By the way, tell me
something. - What?
What's so special
about that girl?
Dad you...
Now that you're meeting
her, see for yourself.
Hurry up dear. They're waiting
since long. - Just a minute, mom.
Wow! This is a good set.
Yes. That's why mom said not
to pour very hot tea.
Or they'll break. They're 52
rupees a pair. - Are they?
Damini herself has made this.
Oh really? - Yes.
She's fond of these things
since childhood.
She's excellent at stitching,
embroidery, weaving.
And she's great at singing and
dancing. - Yes, we've seen that.
That's where he... no.
I was saying, I don't see
Damini's elder sister Devika.
Where's she?
Uncle! Uncle. - Uncle?
She has gone to her uncle's
house. She'll come. - I see.
If anyone asks about sister, say
she's at her uncle's place.
Don't talk too much.
You talk a lot.
Damini's mom! Bring Damini.
Come.
Damini. - This is very...
Greetings. - No greetings.
Touch his feet.
A father-in-law is greater
than the father. - No, no.
It's okay, sit.
This... - No.
Why? - No. - Okay.
Please have it.
Tea.
You have it. - No, you, please.
What?
She's Damini's mother.
Greetings. - Greetings.
Greetings. - Greetings.
Listen.
Before you decide, I want to
say something. - Go ahead.
My sister, Devika... - She has
gone to her uncle's place.
No. She has gone to
Mumbai. With Birju.
Birju was our neighbor.
She'll marry him there. Careful.
It's 52 rupees a pair. They
belong to the neighbor.
You did well to tell us.
Otherwise these days, who...
This is what is special.
This won't change our decision.
Right, father? - What do I say?
Now, we'll call the priest
and fix a date.
Congratulations, sir.
Shekhar, congrats.
Congratulations!
Congratulations! - Bless you!
Congratulations to you too.
Thank you very much.
Get the mouth fast. - Mouth?!
Sweets to sweeten the mouth!
There are nine bangles
on my hands.
What are you doing among women?
You're supposed to be outside,
with the guests! Go!
I'm needed everywhere. How
much can I manage? - Here.
This is Sita necklace. The
legacy of our family.
Now this necklace is yours.
Since you're the elder
daughter-in-law of this family.
It costs 900,000,
daughter-in-law. 900,000!
A rich family's rich gift!
Oh Sumitra! This is too much.
Nothing was given to the
younger daughter-in-law.
And so much for the elder
daughter-in-law!
What is this necklace for her?
She had brought two trunks
of gold with her.
But this poor one...
We're lucky that Shekhar
liked her.
Our Shekhar has been generous
since childhood.
Remember Sumitra?
He saw a kitten suffering
on the road...
...he brought it home
from the streets.
Why are you repeating
old tales, Damu?
I'm saying that our Shekhar
hasn't changed.
His childhood habit still
hasn't left him.
Greetings, madam.
Grandfather says, wearing a mark
wards off the evil eye.
You? - Urmi.
Dear, today you've got
everything due to your luck.
What else do I have to give?
I have... this.
Keep Her with you.
She will always protect
you. Yes.
Madam, what're you doing?
A new bride shouldn't
work so much.
You talk like a granny.
What about you who do
everything here...
...at such a young age?
So what? I work for my home.
Sister. - Leave me.
I'm making a spinach
vegetable for him.
It's a pleasure to feed your
husband yourself. - Oh really?
Damini! - Yes, uncle?
Embroider a pink rose on my
violet kurta (Iong shirt).
Sure. I'll do it.
Damini! - Yes, mummy?
There's my sari on the bed.
Send it to the laundry.
Yes. I'll send the eggplant
to the laundry...
Quiet! I've to stitch a flower
and send the sari. - Damini!
Yes, mother? - We're going to
Mr. Gupta for veneration.
The whole family has
been invited.
Okay. I'll finish the work
and come with Deepa.
No, Deepa is also going with us.
You stay here. Help Urmi.
Some people are coming
for dinner.
Okay.
Come on. There's a lot of work.
We'll finish the work
and watch TV, okay?
It's a small injury Urmi.
Leave it, leave it. Never mind.
What's wrong with you?
- I don't know, madam.
When you get hurt,
I feel very sad.
Where are you, Damini? - What?
There's no one at home.
Where are you?
I'm upstairs.
Urmi. Will you prepare that?
I'll just come, okay?
I've heard it's a pleasure
to feed one's husband.
Okay, okay. I'll cook it myself.
Only when he lets you, right?
What?
What did you say?
Take this! This!
You can't break this
partnership!
I'll lose billions!
It had already been decided.
- It was also decided that...
...Shekhar will marry
my daughter.
You can't link marriage
to business!
Everything is linked for
a businessman, Gupta!
Look, whatever has
happened has...
It has not happened yet!
It will happen now!
I've seen your rise, Gupta.
Now, in this city, I'll
see your downfall!
A loss of 150 million!
Sister. This loss is
only from Baroda.
Add 200 from Kolkatta
and it's 350 million!
Just 650 million short
of a billion.
But Shekhar and he didn't
tell me anything.
Who could they? This has
happened because of Damini.
This Bajaj has now
become an enemy.
Greetings. - Come,
come. Hats off!
What an entry! Wow!
They've come today
from Nasik. - Yes.
I've brought jackfruit for you.
It grew in our backyard.
Damini cooks it deliciously.
- Yes.
Here. - Sister.
Here. Jackfruit worth
350 million!
Now we'll have to eat
only this. Yes!
Damu. Arrange for tea and
breakfast for them.
I'm not well.
Ok.
What made you come here?
Now we've decided to stay here.
What? - Yes. I've seen a house.
It's far and small. But it's
okay for the two of us.
Why so far? Come here.
It's such a big house.
We'll find one room.
No, no.
We don't have even drink water...
...at her daughter's
in-laws' place.
It makes us indebted.
- Indebted?!
Sir, it's not so. Look at uncle.
He's stuck here since 20 years
like a Vindhyachal hill!
He hasn't moved! - Shut up!
Hold this! Hold the jackfruit.
Your kerchief. - Yes.
Arrange for some
snacks for them.
??
...
Dear. How are you?
I'm fine, dad.
Dad, look here. It's such a
nice view of the sea-shore.
There's a lovely breeze
in the evening.
And the red flowers there.
I had never seen them in Nasik.
And there... - Dear...
How are you?
You all want to fly, right?
With your friends,
up in the sky!
Look. I'll quietly
open the door.
Escape without a noise. Okay?
Come on. Escape! Escape!
Escape!
Escape!
What's happening there?
No, nothing. Nothing.
What nothing? You're freeing the
birds and say, nothing!
I... I... - I what?
You know, these are
singing birds.
What? - Yes.
These birds sing.
Birds don't sing in
cages, they cry.
How do you feel here, Damini?
I... - Yes.
I feel a bit scared.
I feel as if I don't
belong here.
I don't what you liked
about me that...
...you married without
knowing me.
I keep wondering what I should
do to keep you happy always.
You don't have to do anything.
You're good as you are.
I feel like making every wish
of yours my mission.
Your smile, your joy is
everything for me now.
I want to keep looking, keep
looking, keep looking... - Mother!
Imp! You scared me.
I'll show you in the evening.
And yes. Don't ever touch
this cage henceforth!
Never touch it! Set them
free now. - Really!
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.
Of our union. Of
our craziness...

I don't ask for anything
else from my God.

I'm your Damini!
Damini!
No! Please! No!
Just a little! - Yes,
just a little!
A little here. A little
here. And here.
Best wishes on your first Holi
(festival of colors).
Now it's my turn! My turn!
Apply just a little!
Just a small mark.
A little? Just a mark?
It shouldn't go in
the eyes. - Yes.
Hey! Don't!
Get lost! - Imp! I'll hit you!
No! No! Leave me! - It's
Holi! - It's Holi!
What's happening?
When she's refusing why are you
forcefully applying color?
Go downstairs!
There's a lot of work
downstairs. Come soon.
Yes, madam. I'll just
come with the sweets.
Damini! Where are you?
They're yelling for
sweets there. - Yes.
You attend to them.
Give me this.
Go and get sweets. Go -Okay.
Yes, coming.
Urmi!
Urmi! - Madam!
Urmi! - Madam!
Brutes! Leave her!
Madam! - Leave her! Leave her!
Beast! Leave her!
Leave her! - Move!
Leave her! - Madam!
Madam! Madam! Madam!??
Rakesh!
Shekhar! Shekhar!
Come down! - You come up!
Shekhar, listen to me!
Shekhar, listen to me!
Shekhar! Rakesh and his friends
have taken Urmi upstairs!
Come fast! Anything
can happen there!
No! No!
No! No!
Rakesh! - No!
Rakesh! - No!
Rakesh! Rakesh!
No!
Shall I call father? - Shut up!
Rakesh! Rakesh!
They are... Damini!
Damini!
Give the car keys! - What
happened to Urmi?
Move! - Where are you taking her?
Come on!
Creep! Weren't you ashamed?
What're you doing? - You
raped her! - Shekhar!
I'll kill you! - Enough! Enough!
Will you kill him? - Yes,
I'll kill him!
That girl has grown up in
this house! - Shekhar!
If she's a servant, doesn't
she have respect? - Shekhar!
Shekhar don't hit him,
please! - Enough!
You should be ashamed! - Shekhar!
Shekhar!
You take care of Damini.
I'll handle everything.
Go! Please!
Disgraceful!
I don't what I had done
that I got such a son!
Daddy, forgive me!
Listen, you go to your in-laws'
place for some days.
If someone asks, say you were
there for some days.
You had gone for Holi.
- Come now. - Get lost!
Dad... - Go! - Come on!
Careful! Slowly!
Urmi! - Relax.
How's Urmi? - Okay.
How are you?
Where is she?
She's fine. She has gone home.
How can she be fine? We should
go there quickly.
She might need us. Might
need a doctor.
When she sees us,
she... - Damini...
Damini, we can't go there.
Why?
There... Damini, it'll
be a police case.
So haven't you all informed
the police yet?
Police... it's Rakesh.
Sir, senior sir has called
you downstairs. - Okay.
The police are here.
Tell him I'm coming.
Damini, the police are here.
They could question you.
Right now, just say you
haven't seen anything.
I'll explain later. Now you've to
*just say you haven't seen anything.
Say you were in the room.
You hadn't gone out.
You hadn't seen anything.
Don't forget.
I've already told you
that that girl Urmi...
...isn't coming to work
since last week.
She was caught stealing,
we threw her out.
And what've we got to do with
what she does outside...
...or what happens with her?
But Urmi has named your son
Rakesh her statement.
So what if she has named him?
She was of loose character.
She must've gone with some
loafer... - Sumitra!
You keep quiet. - Brother-in-law.
Call up Delhi.
He'll be transferred right now.
Whom are you threatening?
A poor girl has been raped
in this house and you...
What rubbish are you talking?
This a decent family's
house, officer.
Mind your language.
Urmi has said everything
in her statement.
She has also said that Damini
has seen everything.
I want to meet Damini and
take her statement.
Damini is not well.
She hasn't come out of her
room since morning.
You... you come tomorrow and
ask her what you want.
Not tomorrow, now! - I said she
*can't meet you! - Look Mr. Shekhar!
Sumitra, get Damini downstairs.
Look dear. Even we're sad
about what happened.
But if this goes too far,
Rakesh's life will be ruined.
He has a wife, kid.
Answer the police
carefully, dear.
This family's respect
now depends on you.
Tell me Ms. Damini.
You've seen what happened
with Urmi.
Urmi has also said in her
*statement that you tried to help her.
They raped her and threw
her in a gutter.
And now that poor girl is
fighting for life in a hospital.
Tell me, Ms. Damini.
Who were they?
If you speak the truth, Urmi
will get justice. Help her.
My husband must've told you.
I'm not well.
I was in my room all day today.
I don't know what you
are saying. - Lies!
You're lying!
Ms. Damini, speak the
truth for God's sake!
Speak the truth for Urmi's
sake! - You're speaking...
Good night, officer.
Your lie will prove very
costly for Urmi.
No, no I don't want
to hear anything!
You lied to me!
You had said Urmi was fine.
What could I do, Damini?
What could I do?
As it is, you're not well
and... - And Urmi?
Think about Urmi.
She's there and we... instead
of doing something for her...
...everyone is lying!
And you made me lie too! - Yes,
I made you lie! I did!
Because one truth from you
will ruin everything!
Look Damini! We have to
suppress this issue.
What? - Yes.
Rakesh is my brother. Brother!
It's about family.
How do we hand him over
to the police?
This police... who will do what...
We shouldn't think
about all this.
In front of us, Urmi was...
We should just help her anyhow.
Why don't you understand,
Damini?
This isn't the time
for emotions.
Be practical.
Look, if this issue flares up...
...Rakesh and his friends
will be punished.
But with it, the reputation of
four families will be ruined.
A girl who has served you all
*day and night is now in hospital.
And you're talking about
families and reputation!
Please Damini, please!
Understand.
Look, no one will be
harmed in anyway.
Speaking the truth has
never harmed anybody.
And neither can it harm.
Let's meet her now.
We'll take mother along too.
It'll be a great
support for her.
Seeing us will cheer Urmi.
Why can't we? Why can't we go?
I want to go. I'll meet Urmi.
Take me, will you? Take me.
I want to meet Urmi.
She must be waiting for us.
She must be waiting for me.
She was raped at the right time.
Now I will ruin the Gupta
clan's reputation.
The game of reputation
begins now.
I thought he'll save us from
ruin after hearing us.
But no, he's just playing.
Brother-in-law, listen to me.
Let's go to Jaunpur.
We did well to save
two acres of land.
It has proved useful
during bad times.
Shut up, Damu!
Mr. Chadda. - Everything is done.
Everything. Date, hearing
and sentence.
Mr. Gupta, the world
knows that when...
...case comes to barrister
*Chadda, it's date is fixed later.
The sentence is given before
that. In my favour.
But the issue is going out of
*hand. - The police come home anytime.
What the boys did isn't
a big mistake.
This happens in a young age.
Everyone does it.
The foolish thing was that if
they had to do all this...
...they should've consulted
me first.
Anyway, they should remember
this in future.
Mr. Chadda, what should
we do now?
Mr. Gupta, I've understood all
*the pieces in the game right now.
I've also understood that in
this game, your son Shekhar...
...and your daughter-in-law
are very weak pieces.
Specially the daughter-in-law.
What's her name? Damini.
She's very emotional.
And the police will quickly
smell her weakness...
...and will go after her like
a dog after a bone.
You send her out of the city
fast. - What are you saying?
Damini is my daughter-in-law.
And my son, Shekhar loves
her very much.
Mr. Gupta, love, friendship,
emotions, relationships...
...are very cheap
and weak things.
They ruin a winning game.
Once you suffer from them,
you're finished.
And I, Inderjeet Chadda,
never accept defeat.
I will ruin everything.
But I will never be defeated.
Madam!
Madam, help me!
Urmi!
Urmi!
Urmi!
Urmi!
Urmi!
Urmi!
I'm Urmi!
I... I'm sorry, Damini!
Damini, what happened?
Control yourself, Damini.
You can't understand
what I go through...
...on seeing you in
this condition.
Look, Damini, I agree that what
you say is absolutely right.
But look at it from
my viewpoint.
How can I go against my family?
What do I do, Damini?
What do I do, Shekhar?
What do I do?
I know.
The whole family is
upset with me.
I don't want to hurt
anyone. No one.
But Shekhar, a sin has been
committed in this house.
And I'm unable to forget it.
You teach me Shekhar,
you tell me.
How does one kill
one's conscience?
Explain to me, Shekhar.
Because it's pricking
me from within.
I'm dying, Shekhar, I'm dying.
Help me.
Help me, Shekhar.
Tell me, creep, who were they?
What're their names? Tell me!
Tell me!
Who took the car keys?
- I don't know sir.
Tell me! - I don't know!
It was good servants
didn't squeal.
Or forget Jaunpur, we'd have
been grinding grains in jail.
The police are constantly
after us.
Forget a bribe; they don't
even want to talk.
I don't understand. Sumitra.
Before the police makes
Damini speak up...
...send her somewhere far.
- But she should go first.
She's just chanting one thing.
That she wants to meet Urmi.
Only Shekhar has stopped
her so far.
It has been four days
since the incident.
That stupid Urmi isn't dying
in the hospital either.
And this Damini isn't
letting us live.
It would've been better
if we had thrown her...
...on the railway
tracks. - Please.
Look.
Somehow we'll have to convince
Damini that Urmi is alright.
And she has gone to her village
with her grandpa.
Send Damini to Delhi
with Shekhar anyhow.
Damini. It's very important to
get the truth out of her, Ram.
So in this case, be sensible,
not forceful. - But sir, I...
And tolerate what you have
to, while doing this.
But win Damini's trust.
This case is very
important for us.
Okay, sir.
The flight is on time.
Damini, you wait here. I'll
get the luggage checked in.
Hello, Ms. Damini.
Inspector Kadam.
I tried to meet you many times.
But your family didn't let me.
So I thought... - Look.
If my family doesn't want
you to meet me...
...you shouldn't be talking
to me like this.
Urmi might not be alive
by the time you return.
She's dying. She's in
hospital. See this.
Urmi in a very bad condition.
Due to a vein bursting...
...she's bleeding continuously.
She can't get up from the bed.
She's waiting for you.
She may have to live
like an invalid now.
She can die too. - Look,
Ms. Damini...
What rubbish is this?
- Look, Mr. Gupta!
Get lost! - I'll destroy your
pride for your wealth!
What do you think! - Can you do
anything as you're a cop?
Will you do as you please
since you're rich?
I'll take you to the court!
I'll take you to the court!
I'll shatter your pride
for your money!
Get lost! Threaten someone else!
You hit a cop! - Shut up!
You'll repent for this!
Is this the way? - Come,
never mind.
He's taking advantage
of his position.
At home, then at the airport.
It's not our mistake at all.
If he's a cop, it doesn't
mean he can do anything.
You keep insisting on going
to the hospital.
How will going to the
hospital help?
The inspector! Wonder
what he told you.
You're bent on going
to the hospital!
We're not going to the
hospital! We can't!
Mr. Chadda has said no
one from the family...
...should go to the hospital.
We don't know what case the
police will make. And you...
You don't like it here, so I
thought I'll take you out.
I had to go to Delhi for
the company's work...
...so I thought business and
holiday could be together.
Now why are you quiet? Why
don't you say something?
Look Damini, my trip to
Delhi is important.
I've missed the evening flight.
I can't miss the last one.
Come on get ready. Pack up.
I won't go.
So go! Go to the hospital!
Meet Urmi!
She's everything for
you! We're nothing!
This family, our reputation!
It is nothing!
Tell the police everything.
Ruin it all! Make it
a spectacle! Damn!
You'll find peace!
Get my brother hanged!
I don't want that.
I...
I... once, just once,
we'll meet Urmi.
If she's fine, being treated
well, we'll be at peace.
What do you want?
Do you think we're
Urmi's enemies?
Are we animals, stones!
We're doing what's to be
done, it's being done.
Dad was saying yesterday,
to give what she wants...
...100-200,000, but suppress
this issue, nothing else.
This won't ruin the family's
reputation and... - What?
You're setting a price
for that girl?
Will money bring back all
that Urmi has lost?
Those who think like this...
...can even kill someone
for their reputation.
Anyone!
It's possible even I...
Madam! Madam! - Urmi!
Madam! Madam! - Urmi!
No! - Madam!
Why didn't you come since
so many days, madam? - No!
No one came, madam. No one!
I didn't know that
you were in this...
I was told that you were fine.
No, madam. I'm not fine.
I'm in a lot of pain!
I'll talk to the doctor.
I'll get your medicine and
everything arranged.
Then you'll be fine
and come back home.
No. Home? I won't go home.
I'll go to my village.
To my grandfather.
Your grandfather didn't come?
Are you alone? - Yes.
I don't know if he
was told or not.
I'll inform him. Your
grandfather will come.
You don't worry. Everything
will be fine.
I will never be fine now. - No!
You will be fine. - No!
No, Urmi, you shouldn't
say that.
Look madam. My... my bleeding
doesn't stop.
You've helped the police a lot
by deciding to give a statement.
But what are you all
doing for Urmi?
From the streets you put
her in a hospital...
...so is the police's duty over?
She's neither being
treated properly...
...nor is anyone looking
after her.
Even her grandpa hasn't
been informed.
We've sent a constable
to her village.
Ms. Damini, I hope you don't
turn hostile tomorrow.
What? - I mean that your
husband isn't here now.
After he comes, under his
pressure you... - No.
I should've told you
this truth earlier.
That day, I don't know why I...
Now I'll never lie. Urmi
should just get well.
Her condition very
bad, Mr. Kadam.
We should admit her to some
good hospital so that...
Everything will be fine, Ms.
Damini. Now you're with us.
Remember clearly what you saw
and give the statement.
Come on.
Look, due to my statement...
...will my husband and
in-laws at some risk?
Because it's not their fault.
Look, you don't worry.
I'm here. You give your
statement fearlessly. Go.
Inspector Kadam. - Yes,
Kadam. - Hello sir.
Good that you called.
Damini is giving her statement.
- Good news.
Our case is strong now.
Yes, sir. That's what she's
getting written.
I've convinced her completely.
Sir, Mr. Gupta had
called up too.
We've spoken about 300,000.
Congratulations, sir.
Now we have the statement too.
We'll get more money. - Very
good just a minute.
Mr. Bajaj, we've made
Damini squeal.
Gupta is giving 300,000.
To forget the case.
Whatever Gupta is giving
to forget the case...
...take 100,000 more from me
for raising this issue.
Okay, let's see how much the
case is forgotten or raised.
Kadam, the case is becoming
too important.
Be careful, okay? - Sir.
Think of my promotion.
The promotion will be done,
Kadam, why do you worry?
Thank you.
Come on! Get up!
But... Get up fast! - But
why... - Come on!
Come on! You're a rich
father's son?
Listen to me... - Come on!
When my husband comes, you'll
lose your job, just see!
I'll call Delhi just now.
- Call wherever you want.
This warrant has been issued
on Damini's statement.
Do what you want.
Sister! Damini!
Damini! Come down! - Come down!
You spilt your venom at
the police station!
Are you at peace now?
Wonder which moment
Shekhar saw you!
Everything is ruined.
Now get out of this house!
I knew you would...
I did what I felt was right for
this family's well-being.
If I've erred unknowingly,
forgive me.
Wherever I stay, I'll pray for
the well-being of this family.
A woman is like a man's
shoes. - Yes.
And this woman has come
out of the kitchen...
...to challenge men!
I'll never let Damini become
an example for other women.
I'll send her to the
mental asylum.
Who's that girl to you? Who's
she? How's she related to you?
She's also is a woman like me.
Is this relationship not enough?
I don't want to argue with you.
It's your in-laws' decency that
he still wants to take you home.
And a woman's real house is her
husband's, not her father's.
Who has made this custom, dad...
...that a woman's real house is
her husband's, not her father's?
The house in which she grows,
is it snatched away from her?
Does a new relationship
break all the old ones?
Then doesn't the woman have
any right to that house?
We don't mean that, dear... - Mom.
Why is a woman an outsider?
Why is she called
another's wealth?
If she has to leave her in-laws'
place for some reason...
...who's there for her?
Where will she go?
Should she commit suicide?
Is there no custom
for that, mother?
Does a woman's palanquin go
from her house or her bier?
Does a father perform his
girl's nuptials or funeral?
Enough dear, enough!
Keep quiet now!
Understand what I say, dear.
It's not about some days.
It's about your whole life.
How long will this
old couple live?
Don't be stubborn, dear.
Don't be scared.
You'll be on TV.
Everyone should know what
happened with you.
Naren! Zoom in. Zoom
in to the face.
This mark on the face should be
visible. - What's happening?
Move.
Look. Look.
Look. When you were gang-raped,
how did you feel?
How did you feel?
What cheap question
are you asking?
Who're you? You're disturbing.
Move back.
Move back. Let us work. Naren I
want this mark. - Please, please.
Move her! The mark will be seen
only when we get light!
What are you doing?
Are you her relative?
I... I'm Damini. - Damini!
Damini Gupta! - Damini Gupta!
Hey! Damini Gupta!
Damini! Damini Gupta!
- Ms. Damini!
Naren, pan the camera here.
Hello, I'm Rita Upadhyay
from Network.
You must be watching
our video magazine.
Today, we have Damini
Gupta with us.
Kedarnath Gupta's
daughter-in-law.
Where has the old man
come from? Move him!
He's the grandpa! The girl's
grandpa. - Grandpa?
Yes. - So sit here. Sit.
Let him sit. - Okay? Okay?
No, make him stand,
make him stand.
Give some backlight. Backlight!
What do you think of rape?
What spectacle is this?
- Ms. Damini.
How did you get strength to
fight women's exploitation?
She'll say that later. Naren,
pan from grandpa to Ms. Damini.
Ms. Damini, bring some anger and
a little sadness on the face.
Ms. Damini, the sari's border
isn't looking good.
Can you arrange for
another sari?
Let it be. - Lift it up. Lift it.
Yes. - Move!
Move!
Don't you feel ashamed?
You want to dramatize and
sell a woman's ruin?!
You don't see this
innocent's pain.
You see my sari's border!
That... - What do you
want to know?
Huh? What do you want to see?
Look!
Why? Why did your nose wiggle?
You love to write and publish
the truth! You can't see it!
To see it, you need a kerchief!
Go! Go away!
Look we... - Go away!
Go! Or I'll scream!
You didn't tell me that
Damini has left home!
Whenever I called from Delhi
you... - What could we do, Vijay?
There were business
problems and...
There's life besides
business too, dad.
Damini is emotional but
she's not bad at heart.
I'd have come and
set things right.
You're saying as if it's our
fault. As if we threw her out.
We fell at her feet and cried.
We told her not to go.
No, lies! This is a lie!
Damini can't do this!
Wow son! She has fooled
you in a few days.
You're sad for her but not about
the police taking your brother!
Other, Rakesh is my...
Mother Damini too is this...
Mother!
Dad, dad, you too...
Son, you must be tired.
Get some rest.
We've suffered so much
since childhood.
Mom and dad have been so worried
about our marriages.
What have we not gone through?
And now, when you
have everything...
I've not forgotten anything.
I've not forgotten anything.
I understand everything.
Today, an innocent's life was
ruined in that house...
...and everyone is quiet.
And they want me to
keep quiet too.
I can't keep quiet, sister.
If I keep quiet, won't I become
a party to that sin? - No.
No, Chhoti.
I think the sun has risen
from the west today.
Damini in our humble home?
Mr. Shekhar hasn't come?
No.
Yes. He's not an ordinary man.
He handles business
worth billions.
But get him once.
I want to show him my program.
Birju mimicry artiste,
all in one!
Meena Kumari, get me some water.
She keeps crying. Doesn't
understand my talent.
Wow! Mother Goddess' idol!
We perform shows for Her.
I do them for free. - Here.
Have you brought the
Munna's medicine?
Munna's medicine? - Yes. I
had given you the money.
Yes, Munna's medicine!
The thing is, I met my
cronies on the way.
Then we played rummy.
They won, I won.
At times they won, I lost. They
took everything and I'm here.
You only keep yapping!
You can't earn a penny!
Whatever I earn through hard
work, you gamble it away!
It's always money, money, money!
You spoil my mood!
You keep lecturing me!
This is my house,
not your school!
Don't talk to me like a teacher.
I command such respect outside!
She doesn't understand
my talent.
You're a curse on
my life. A curse!
Or I'd have been famous today!
Yes, Ms. Damini. Do get Shekhar.
There's my program in
our colony next week.
Damini. Love is a blessing which
only the lucky ones receive.
You've got it. Don't reject it.
Shekhar adores you.
And you left him?
Is there anything greater
than love?
You?
Sister! - You?
Please come.
Greetings. - Greetings.
When did you come from
Delhi? - Day before.
I'll just come from the market.
Please sit. - It's okay.
Shall I send a cold drink
for you? - No, thank you.
Please sit.
Shall I prepare tea?
You didn't do the right
thing, Damini.
Leaving home like this.
Talking against the family
to the police.
All this...
I didn't say anything
against anyone.
I just spoke the truth. - To
hell with your truth!
The police, press and others
who sympathize with you...
...don't care for the truth
or Urmi's life!
They're only using
you. That's it!
They want to exploit us
with you as their pawn!
This is the politics of
rich people, Damini...
...why don't you understand?
Damini, you're being made the
victim of their conspiracy.
Everyone is playing this game
for his own benefit.
I don't understand this game.
I only want justice for Urmi.
What justice? And from whom?
Nothing will happen,
Damini, nothing.
Look, Damini.
Nothing is ruined yet.
Forget everything. Come home.
With me. For me.
I'll explain to mom and dad. You
shouldn't mind what they say.
And you'll be alone here,
I won't like it.
Even I'm not happy staying
away from you.
But... - But what?
The same madness again!
The heart's burden. That truth!
The sad thing is, Damini, that
for you, other things...
...are worth more than my love.
But my life... no.
If Urmi goes to court, we'll
be jailed. - For what?
Urmi can't even walk now. And
the man who had gone to...
...the hospital from the court
for the statement...
...has been bought by dad.
As for Damini, Chadda will
strip her in the court!
My dad also said not to worry.
This Damini's truth
doesn't matter.
The one who's rich
can do anything.
He can do anything. - He
can do anything.
So shall we do it again?
- He'll rape again!
It's a conspiracy to defame
the Gupta clan.
Whether Damini's story
is true or not...
...what she saw or didn't
see will be found later.
I say no such thing happened
in Gupta's house.
Milord, that girl Urmi is of
loose character. - It's a lie.
Urmi isn't of loose character.
She's a decent, hard-working,
honest girl, Milord! - Wait!
But you're falsely accusing...
- Quiet! I'm speaking!
That girl is a thief, of loose
character and a cheat.
A week earlier she was
caught stealing and got fired.
After that whether she was raped
or had fun with her friends...
...what has the Gupta family
to do with that?
Objection Milord. Urmi was
raped by four boys...
...and in the same house.
With the charge sheet, the
police's investigation report...
...and the medical certificate
is also there.
That's why I want that... - You
want a lot, Mr. Saxena.
This is a court.
Not a temple or mosque where
wishes are fulfilled.
Hard evidence is presented here,
not coconuts or incense sticks.
And I've exposed many such false
cases in this very court!
You have seen it too.
Yes, Ms. Damini. Was she
clothed then or not?
Judge, I've already said
that the rape was done.
Is this question necessary?
That's why I'm asking, was
she clothed or not?
When I saw her first,
at that time...
Speak louder, I can't hear.
What did you see?
When I saw her first,
she was okay.
They were just taking her away.
And when I reached there
with my husband...
Was she naked?
Speak up. - At that time,
she was clothed but...
Speak louder I can't hear, I
*said it earlier too! Speak louder!
The sari was there, but
it was only wrapped.
So that girl was half-naked.
Okay, now tell me, what were
the four boys doing?
I think... - Don't think,
speak with conviction!
It's about the lives
of four young boys.
Say it with conviction.
Two boys were near her head.
- Where were their hands?
On her chest or shoulders?
Two boys had caught her and...
...had held her hands.
And what was the
third boy doing?
He was near her feet and...
Speak louder I can't hear, I
*said it earlier too! Speak louder!
One boy was sitting near her
feet and had caught her foot.
Look at me and speak. Don't
lower your gaze!
Look at me!
Was he holding her
feet or thighs?
Do you know what thighs are?
The part above the knees
is known as thighs.
Was he holding her
feet or thighs?
Thighs. - He was holding
her thighs.
And what was the fourth
boy doing?
The fourth boy...
He... was lying near Urmi.
Was he lying near her
or abo... - Shut up!
Now tell me. If I present
some boys before you...
...will you be able to recognize
those four among them?
Yes. - Milord,
I'd like to present some
boys in the court...
...with your permission.
Permission granted.
- Come on, boys.
But they were only four boys.
You'll have to recognize
those four from these.
That day was Holi and everyone
was colored like this.
Come, recognize them. - Yes.
Come, come. Look closely.
Don't get scared. Look properly.
Yes, look carefully.
Was he the one? No.
Next. He? Look closely, closely.
Don't be scared. Look.
Look.
Is he the one? - Hold him
back! I'm identifying!
Recognize! He?
Judge, there weren't so
many colors that day.
This is how the colors
of Holi are!
Look! Recognize, is he the one?
Judge, please ask him
to hold them back.
He's trying to confuse me.
Is he the one?
He... - Wrong! He's constable
Jadhav! Go!
But I didn't say that he...
- Never mind. Never mind.
One makes mistakes,
one makes mistakes.
Look, is he the one?
Was he holding the hands!
- Hold them back!
Was he holding the feet?
- Hold them back!
Recognize! Was he holding
her thighs! - Back!
Keep them away! Keep them away!
Keep them away!
Go out! Out! Out! - Mr. Chadda,
what do you want to prove?
I wanted to prove that this
girl is insane! - What?
On seeing colors, she loses her
mental balance! - No, no!
There's no such thing... - She
starts spinning yarns!
This is all a lie... - She behaves
abnormally! - Father, look...
She screams! Shouts!
I... - Quiet!
Objection Milord!
Mr. Chadda is trying to
complicate the case!
Milord. I want to present
some more witnesses.
One day I saw her looking at
the design on the floor.
She was talking to herself.
Blabbering insanely.
I had got her a Bandini
printed dress.
It was so colorful, Judge.
But this crazy one tore that
dress to rags! Yes!
I had brought her multi-colored
threads for embroidery.
She looked at them as if I had...
...opened a basket of snakes
and scorpions!
She began abusing
me. Crazy woman!
Milord they're lying to save
their family honor!
Milord, now I'll present
a witness...
...who isn't from the
Gupta family.
Damini's father,
Mr. Chandrakant.
Swear that you'll speak
the truth. - Yes.
Is it true that your daughter
Damini's mentally unstable?
No. - What? - Yes?
Yes.
She was eight-years old...
...when she was playing Holi with
her friends on the terrace.
She fell from the terrace on
Holi and lost her senses.
What? - She was unconscious
for three hours.
When she came to... - Dad?
She started behaving strangely.
She started blabbering.
Since then we keep her
away from colors.
She started imagining
weird things.
Making stories. - Point
to be noted, Milord.
But Damini was very nice.
She's a very good
daughter of mine.
She takes such good
care of the house...
Okay, you can go now. Go.
Milord... - Judge!
Damini is a good daughter.
May all parents get
such daughters!
She has never harmed
anyone, Judge!
She'll never want to harm
anyone. - Okay, okay, you go.
Go and sit. Go.
Dad!
Milord! This girl, Damini
is an insane girl.
And taking advantage of this...
...the Gupta family's enemies,
their business rivals...
...have disgraced them.
I wish that the accusations
against those four boys...
...should be taken back and
Damini should be sent to...
...a good mental asylum
for treatment.
That's all Your Honor.
After hearing the witnesses'
statements...
...this court concludes that...
...Damini should be kept in a
government mental asylum...
...for two weeks under
doctors' observation.
After the doctors' report...
...the next hearing of this
case will be fixed.
You've made a spectacle
out of Damini!
Chadda had said that he'll
get case dismissed today.
On your saying, I didn't
come to the court...
...and now you're saying she has
been sent to a mental asylum!
I don't understand...
What's your enmity with Damini?
What sin has she committed?
Damini is my wife, your
daughter-in-law...
...this family's honor... - Go
get her! Get her here!
And send all of us to jail!
Ruin this family's honor!
Ruin everything!
Do what you want!
When you talked of marriage...
...we didn't see the family
or the status.
We just your love and made
her our daughter-in-law.
And today she's bent on ruining
this family's honor!
And we should stand
and just watch!
But father, Damini too...
- Look Shekhar.
This fight is not
to harm Damini.
We're fighting to save this
family's reputation.
It's just a matter
of some days, son.
We'll get a report that she's
mentally unstable.
Whatever she said had
never happened.
The case will be over.
Bring her back.
I'll go with you to
bring her back.
Enough. I'm your father.
I know you well, son.
I won't let anything that
hurts you, happen.
Can I meet Damini?
You shouldn't meet
her for some days. - Why?
The police, press have their
eye on this case.
The case shouldn't get
more complicated.
Look, son. It's just a
matter of a few days.
Everything will be fine.
You had said the case will be
dismissed if I lie in court.
I said you what you told me to.
Bring my daughter to
your house soon.
She's in the mental asylum. - Mr.
Chandrakant, don't worry...
...she'll come very soon. Go.
She'll come soon. - Mr. Bajaj!
Come, come, come.
Yes, go. I said she'll come. Go.
Come, sit, Mr. Bajaj.
Mr. Gupta, Mr. Bajaj,
now forget the past.
Damini won't come back now.
You think about yourselves
and unite.
Become relatives! Relatives!
I just wish my daughter becomes
their daughter-in-law.
I had to hold this marriage due
to Shekhar's adamancy or...
...we weren't happy either.
I wasn't with the name itself.
Damini! Lightning!
She struck like lightning
and separated you two.
Uncle! Such lightning glimmers
like a fire-fly...
...in Chadda's backyard!
Go. Arrange for some champagne.
- Yes, right away.
What Mr. Chadda said is final.
I've restrained Shekhar
so far saying that...
...Damini is being taken care
of in the mental asylum.
But if he finds... - She's
being treated well, Gupta.
Everything's arranged to make
Damini insane in the asylum.
She's been given many shocks.
Let's see how many shocks
this lightning can take!
With my third eye, I
see Damini's end.
Father will come,
mother will come.
Sister will come.
They'll then pull my braid
and take me far away!
In the train!
She's spinning it! Look! She's
spinning it! - Quiet!
Or I'll hit you!
She'll hit me!
I'll tell mother. She'll
hit everyone!
Everyone hits me!
I'll tell sister. She'll also
come and hit everyone.
She'll hit everyone!
Why haven't you turned
Damini insane yet?
Scaring her too much or giving
her many shocks...
...could cause brain hemorrhage.
She could even die.
She could die?
Doctor have there been
any such deaths here?
We do take complete precautions.
But some patients have
committed suicide.
So Damini should commit
suicide too. - What?
I mean, doctor, that
if you can...
...such death which
appears suicide.
She can die accidentally.
- Doctor!
Yes? - Doctor, Damini
isn't in her room.
What? - Yes. - Come on.
We take good care
but I don't how...
What care! Is this a
hospital or a maze!
You'll pay heavily
for this, madam.
Rakesh! - Tell me!
I searched the ground, kitchen,
but couldn't find her.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Stop! Hey!
Hey!
Leave me!
Hey listen!
Excuse me, doctor! - Yes.
It's dad's call downstairs
and Mr. Chadda...
...also wants to talk with you.
It's very, very urgent.
Shall we go?
Come on.
Ram Singh! Ram Singh! - Yes, sir!
One girl has escaped
from the asylum!
Come, let's check! Come fast!
There she is! In front!
Catch her! Fast!
Open the door!
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
Hey drunkard! Leave the girl!
Haven't you heard?
Move back!
Leave her! - Leave the girl!
Peter!
I think it's going to rain.
My house is close by.
If you want, you can
stay for sometime.
I'll drop you.
Here. Have tea.
It'll be good for you.
I'll arrange for a rickshaw.
- You're a lawyer?
I was, once.
Who were the ones following you?
My name is Damini.
Is this the place? - Yes.
That drunkard had taken
her from here.
Forget it, Damini. Forget it.
Forget this court.
You won't get anything.
So won't we get justice?
Justice? I've seen the nakedness
of justice and law, Damini.
Not seen, I've suffered it.
Truth. Conscience.
It's all rubbish.
Those who live for them
get only pain.
My wife Aarti also had
ideals like you.
She's used to talk like you.
It was her dream that
I become a barrister.
That I fight for truth
and justice.
One day she was buying something
from the footpath.
A drunken rich guy crushed
her under his car.
Damini, I couldn't even
get justice for her.
They were the same people.
This Chadda, this court,
all of them.
Witnesses were bought,
turned hostile.
People sell their honesty for
pennies, Damini, for pennies!
If one law is created
to stop a crime...
...ten ways are created
to break it.
And in this, what justice
will one get?
And I?
Like a fool, kept going
to the court.
And all I got was a date.
I agree that time was
very cruel to you.
But if you lose heart, who'll
fight for those like us?
I've quit going to
court, Damini.
Not for mine or Urmi's sake...
...for Aarti's sake... - Don't
mention Aarti, Damini!
I'm not mentioning
but reminding you.
She wanted to make you a
barrister so that you could...
...get justice for the poor and
weak... - I'm dead for this world!
Dead!
So is a girl, her life, her
honor nothing to you?
It isn't! It isn't!
Okay. Then forget everything.
Drown in your liquor!
Aarti's soul will get
peace! - Damini!
The court which has mocked
at my Aarti's death...
...I won't ever go that
court! Never!
You had said you'd dispatched
this letter, but this is here!
Sir, I thought... - What
did you think?
You thought you'll lie
and get away with it?
Why do you fear the truth?
Let it be, Shekhar, it's a
small thing. - No, Naren!
Why does man lie? Why does
he fear the truth? Why?
Everyone is lying. Everyone!
I just hope everything
is okay with Damini.
I hope everything's fine.
No! I won't open it.
Damini has to be taken to
the asylum. Come on.
I won't let you take
her to the asylum!
They're making excuses to
avoid taking her home!
It's the court's order.
How can she not go?
No! She's not at home.
I can't open the door.
Sharma, break the
door. - Yes, sir.
Damini you escape! Escape
from the window!
Run!
She has escaped from the
window, follow her!
Enough, Damini! Enough!
Come quietly, or I'll
have to use force!
Vow, Kadam, vow! You showed
great agility!
So you were finally promoted.
You've been given the job
of using force on women.
You've stopped practicing so
have you forgotten law, Govind?
I've an arrest warrant
for this woman.
Even I've a piece of government
paper. Stay order.
Now Damini won't go anywhere
till the next hearing.
Go to those whom you're
serving these days...
...and find some new way out.
I'll see you, Govind.
Whenever, wherever you want,
send a constable...
...I'll show you.
Watch your step, Kadam.
The case is very slippery.
If you slip, you'll
go tumbling down!
No, Damini. No.
You won't cry now.
They will cry.
No. They.
We're finished, ruined,
destroyed!
Only two ways are left,
brother-in-law.
If we're saved, then Jaunpur or
the mental asylum! - Shut up!
Jaunpur! Jaunpur! Jaunpur!
Have you gone crazy?
I haven't gone crazy alone.
We have all gone crazy.
This Chhada used to say,
lightning like Damini...
...glows like a fire-fly
in his backyard!
Hasn't lightning struck you?
He was out to make Damini
insane! - Uncle!
Learn to stay within
your long shirt!
Will that drunkard
Govind save her?
Last time too, I had trapped
him so badly in dates...
...that he forgotten the
way to the court!
That's what will happen now too.
I'll press such a nerve
that he'll scream!
Urmi!
What has happened?
Grandpa, how did this...
Madam, she's gone!
Till yesterday, she
was so happy.
She was saying we'll all
go to the village.
Mr. Govind, this...
Urmi!
She was to be operated
yesterday.
The patient couldn't
bear the pain.
She committed suicide.
Urmi can't commit suicide!
This is a lie! - What's
the lie about this?
Everything is the truth.
This is Urmi's letter
found in her hand.
And we've just done
the survey too.
Damini, read Mr. Kadam's truth.
Now I can't bear the pain.
The pain is increasing.
I'm willfully committing
suicide.
This is a lie. This is
not Urmi's letter.
She couldn't even write! - What
rubbish are you talking?
This letter was found
in her hand.
You are talking rubbish.
Rubbish.
Your truth which was found
in Urmi's hand... hand...
...and this hand is
blood-stained.
And there's not even a drop
of blood on your truth?
Many such questions will
be raised in the court.
Many questions.
And I'll make you write
such a letter too.
In the court.
Govind! You're accusing a
responsible police officer!
You know the meaning of messing
with the police? - I know.
The police and your police
station too...
...where many brave soldiers
show their bravery...
...after tying up a man.
Kadam, have you ever
gone to a zoo?
What? - Zoo.
There, even kids throw peanuts
on a caged lion.
That's different.
If you face a lion in a
field, your notions about...
...being a man will vanish.
Govind! - Don't shout!
Save your baritone
for the court.
You've to give many replies.
Listen.
Tell Chadda that Govind is
coming to the court again.
Better than facing me in
court, Govind, let's...
...settle the matter outside.
You know, Inderjeet Chadda
never accepts defeat.
Chadda, have you seen kids
taking off a kite...
...from an electric wire? - What?
Even kids can take off
kites from some wires!
It's different that the
wire you've touched...
...by taking up Damini's case
will give you such a shock...
...that you'll forget
tossing your head!
You're ruined but are
still arrogant!
Gupta is willing
to give 400,000.
It's a big price for
a girl's honor.
You've progressed a lot, Chadda.
From being a law broker, you've
started selling honor!
This profession is called
pimping! - Govind!
Don't shout! Or I'll settle
this case right here!
Neither a date, nor a hearing!
Justice right away!
That too instantly!
Chadda, reason with
him! Tell him!
Many such toys are sold
in the market.
But the guts needed
to play with them...
...isn't sold in any market.
A man is born with it.
And when this 2.5 kilo hand
falls on someone...
...he doesn't get up. He dies!
I'll reply to all this
in court tomorrow.
And yes, if you do anything
insolent in the court...
...I'll hit you right there!
The judge will keep screaming
for order...
...and you'll keep
getting thrashed!
Relax...
Milord, this Damini is a very
cunning and sly woman!
She was born in poverty.
But she always dreamt of riches!
That's why she trapped a decent
boy like Shekhar...
...with her beauty.
Actually she was eyeing the
Gupta family's treasure.
And when she couldn't get
it despite her attempts...
...she was upset!
She decided to get revenge
from the family...
...which shattered her dreams.
And taking advantage of this,
the Gupta family's enemies...
...bought her with money.
And they hatched a
big conspiracy.
They tried to prove that the
rape which happened outside...
...happened in Mr.
Gupta's house...
...so that they could ruin
Gupta family's reputation.
Milord!
Such a slimy, lowly and sly girl
should be punished severely...
...so that womankind
can learn a lesson!
That's all, Your Honor!
Your Honor, Mr. Chadda
has confused me a bit.
I think he watches too
many Hindi movies!
Because his case is
like these films.
There are many stories
entangled in it.
Last time, Mr. Chadda had said
that Damini is insane.
And today he's saying
Damini is sly.
So sly that she can be scheming.
She can conspire, plan.
I think, Milord, a girl who
is insane cannot be sly.
And if she's so sly,
she can't be insane.
That's why Milord, I want
that like Damini...
...Mr. Chadda should also be
sent to the mental asylum...
For some days. When he's
fine, he can say clearly...
...whether Damini is
insane or sly.
So that I can prepare my
defense accordingly.
That's all, Milord.
Milord, I've proved that
Damini is a lowly...
Lowly are those who rape a
woman living with them!
Those who kill a helpless
woman in hospital are lowly!
That girl was not raped
in Mr. Gupta's house!
And neither was she killed!
She has committed suicide!
And I've presented my
witnesses for that!
I'd like to question those
very witnesses, Milord!
Permission granted.
You're working with Mr. Gupta
since 10 years. - Yes, sir.
So you're his loyal one. - Yes.
You're honest. - Yes.
He has full faith in you. - Yes.
You look after the
cars too. - Yes.
Like repairs, filling
petrol. - Yes.
Everything... - It's
my responsibility.
When those four boys took Urmi...
Mr. Chadda, pay attention.
When those four took her,
they must be worried. - Yes.
They must've looked for you,
for the car, keys. - No, sir.
The Gypsy's car... the Gypsy's
keys aren't with me, sir.
How do you know they
went in a Gypsy?
No, sir. I came to know later.
So you came to know later
about the rape.
Point to be noted, Milord.
Okay Mangesh, you go. - Ok.
Bloody fool! - Mangesh!
Yes? - Mr. Chadda you'd like
to scold Mangesh? - What?
You were muttering so I thought
you wanted to ask something.
No. - Yes, Mr. Kadam.
Urmi mustn't have slit her
throat with a letter hand.
And she couldn't hold the letter
after slitting her throat.
So it means someone else
kept the letter.
That... - What?
Mr. Chadda, do you understand
this language?
You can't hear anything anyway.
Milord, the biggest thing is
that Urmi couldn't write.
Her ration card isn't signed
but has a thumb impression.
And Urmi's killers perhaps
didn't know this.
Just as Mr. Kadam and Mr.
Chadda don't know.
Yes, Mr. Chadda, am I wrong?
Your Honor, now I'd like to call
Damini's husband, Shekhar Gupta.
Permission granted.
Say I'll speak only the truth.
- I'll speak only the truth.
Mr. Shekhar, do you
love your wife?
I don't want to reply to
such a silly question.
Amazing. Milord, I've asked
a straight question.
Does a husband love
her wife or not?
Mr. Chadda did I ask
something wrong? No.
Tell me, do you or
don't you? - Yes.
What did you say? Mr. Chadda,
did you hear? No.
Look, Mr. Chadda and I
are short of hearing.
Speak louder, please.
Yes, I do.
Not with lowered eyes.
Look at your wife and say
do you love her or not?
This is a question of
a woman's trust.
I do, a lot.
Milord, Mr. Shekhar loves his
wife... sorry... Ioves her a lot.
I've heard that, so has Mr.
Chadda and all of us.
It's another thing that he
could've said it with a smile.
Mr. Shekhar, I'm surprised that
you love a girl who is...
...hot-headed, insane.
You love a girl who insults
your parents.
You love a girl who has ruined
your family's peace...
...and who loves not you
but your wealth.
A woman who has destroyed
the Gupta family's...
What are you saying? You say
whatever you feel like?
I'm not saying this.
Your able lawyer, Mr. Chadda
and your family...
...accused Damini of all this.
Am I wrong? No, right?
Forget it. Even I know
they're lying.
Mr. Shekhar, tell me...
...on Holi, when your scared
wife came to you...
...and took you to the terrace,
where you saw Urmi being raped...
...Mr. Chadda, please
pay attention...
...what did you do?
Nothing like that
happened. - What?
That means Damini is lying.
I didn't say that.
What did you say?
Damini says the rape took
place, you say it didn't.
So Damini is lying.
Why is she lying?
Now why is she... nothing
like that happened.
I say, nothing happened.
That means Damini
is insane. - No!
Mr. Chadda, I'm sorry.
You're right.
Damini is hot-headed, lowly,
a woman who has been sold!
Shut up! Stop this bloody
nonsense! - I am talking sense!
Stop it! Stop it! - Mr. Govind.
Mr. Govind, come
here. Come here.
You don't have the right to talk
to my husband like this!
Whether he testifies for me or
against me, it's his wish.
But I can't tolerate his...
Please don't embarrass
him in the court!
Let him go.
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are? - What?
Am I your slave? Servant?
Have you bought me?
I won't let a lowly woman like
you come close to me! - Govind!
One more word to my wife and...
Sorry, Damini.
Milord, did you see?
When I say something to the
husband, the wife is upset.
When I say something to the
wife, the husband screams.
It proves that they love
each other deeply.
Even in this delicate moment,
it's like a rock!
Despite the fact that
Damini has accused...
...Shekhar's younger
brother of rape.
Although Damini has pulled
his family to court...
...Shekhar can't hear a
word against Damini.
Because he knows what Damini
is doing is right.
What she's saying is the truth.
And now I want to hear that
truth from Mr. Shekhar.
Mr. Shekhar, now I won't
ask you any questions.
I'm quitting this case.
Because Damini doesn't
need me but you.
She's your wife. You are
everything to her.
So you have to take a decision.
Will you get your innocent
wife punished...
...to save those four criminals?
You have to decide. You.
Milord! I don't understand
anything!
What does he want to
prove by showing...
...husband and wife's deep love?
He should be ashamed of...
...hiding behind a woman's
false emotions!
Shut up, law broker! - Shut
up, you lowly lawyer!
Order! Order! Order!
Milord! Suddenly I'm not well...
I request the court to...
...give some other date, sir.
Due to Mr. Chadda's illness,
this case is adjourned.
Its next date will
be fixed later.
Now this fight isn't between
us and Damini, Mr. Gupta.
On one side are those who've
been bearing atrocities.
And we are on the other side.
By uniting with the common man...
...Damini has gained
a lot of power.
And now there's only
one way out of this.
Only one way.
Just as Urmi's murder was
turned into a suicide...
...Damini's death should be
turned into a road accident.
We'll have to douse her fire
of truth with her own blood.
Good!
A woman whose integrity
you couldn't buy...
...against whose goodness
you couldn't fight...
...whose trust you
couldn't break...
...by killing her, you're nicely
proving your manhood.
Stop this rubbish!
The whole city is mocking at us!
People are abusing us on the
streets! You know, don't you?
Now there's only one way
to save our honor.
Honor? What honor, father?
The one in whose house an
innocent girl was raped...
...is talking of honor?
The one who gets the girl killed
in hospital is talking of honor?
The one who thinks of killing
his daughter-in-law...
...because she's honest,
is thinking of honor?
Where's the honor? Where's
that honor?
Rather than living with this,
it's better to die in shame!
To hide one crime...
...how many crimes will you
commit, father? How many?
You don't know, father,
how far you've stooped!
Today I'm proud that I'm
Damini's husband.
But I'm ashamed to say that
I'm Kedarnath Gupta's son!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
With your father you...
- Enough! Enough!
I feel like stopping your
breath right here!
But I won't be able
to kill anyone.
But I will regret it!
And yes! I'll support Damini!
Do what you can!
Damini will win! Damini!
This is our Shekhar! - Shekhar!
Where are you going? We'll
miss our train. Sit. Move.
Even a street dog helps in such
times. This is our Shekhar.
Driver! Follow the car!
Tinu, no one should know Damini
is at your place. - Okay.
Bring Damini to the court from
the backside, carefully.
I could be attacked.
But it's important for Damini
to reach the court.
You don't worry, she's
like my sister.
Govind survived!
Damini shouldn't reach
court tomorrow!
I'll stop her!
I'll take the next date.
And before that date...
Milord, Damini is a very sly
and intelligent girl.
By now she knows she'll
be exposed.
She has fled.
Now only the police
can bring her here.
Let's wait for that
day, Milord...
...and the next date should
be given. - Your Honor!
I'm sure someone is
stopping her from coming.
But I'm sure that
she'll come here.
Because many people have
hopes from her.
Our blessings are with her.
She'll surely come,
Milord. Surely.
Tinu, go fast.
Go, Yadav!
This is height of waiting.
Now the next date
should be given.
Milord!
Before you give the date,
I want to say something.
Permission granted.
In the first date, it was said
that Damini is insane.
She was sent to the
mental asylum...
...where attempts were made
to drive her insane.
Before the next date...
...Urmi was murdered
in the hospital...
...and it was turned into
a suicide case.
Though I had proven that
Urmi didn't commit suicide.
She was murdered.
That day Sjekhar was about
to speak the truth...
...but Mr. Chadda again
played his trick.
Feigning illness,
he took a date.
Otherwise, Milord, this case
would've been over that day.
And today, you're giving
a date again.
Before that date, someone will
crush me under a truck...
...and it'll be made a
road accident case.
You will again give a date.
And before that date...
...Damini will be driven insane
and sent to the asylum.
In this way, there'll be no one
to fight for the truth...
...nor anyone to ask for justice.
What'll remain is just a date.
That's what has been
happening, Milord.
One has got a date after
date, date after date...
...date after date, date after
date, but no justice, Milord!
No justice! What one has
got is this date!
Brokers of law have
used this date...
...as a weapon against
justice, Milord.
Between two dates, they sell law
outside the court! Sell it!
Here, witnesses are snatched,
bought and killed!
And what remains is a date!
People sell their property to
fight cases for justice.
What they take away is a date!
Women have sold jewelry
and nuptial threads for it!
They also got just a date!
Doing the rounds of this
court for years...
...many litigants become history!
Even they get just a date!
This case is of the weak and
tormented people of India.
Today, their eyes on you! You!
On what you give them today.
Justice or date!
If you can't give them justice,
stop this drama!
Throw away these boxes!
Tear and burn these law books...
...so that others don't get
ruined in this maze of justice!
So that they don't get ruined!
Milord! What's happening?
This is an insult to the court!
It is contempt of court!
I say, punish him!
Punish him right now, quickly!
- Order! Order!
Mr. Chadda, the court will
decide who should be punished.
Order! Order!
Until the court reaches a
decision, it won't be adjourned.
Come! Come, move forward!
Move forward!
You're man, show your
manhood! Show me!
Move forward!
Touch me! Touch me! Come!
Move forward!
Why are you moving back!
Move ahead! Touch me! Come!
Milord! I can say with surety...
...that Damini won't come back!
Damini will not come
back at all, Milord!
Damini is here! - Damini is here!
Damini is here!
Damini are you alright?
They were trying to kill
me, Mr. Govind.
I escaped with great difficulty
to come here.
Milord! I was right!
There was an attempt
to murder Damini.
Now the court can understand...
...who could benefit from
Damini's death.
Milord why would Gupta
and Bajaj do this?
Point to be noted, Milord.
I didn't name anybody.
By naming Mr. Bajaj, Mr.
Chadda has proved that...
...he's also involved in this
conspiracy with Mr. Gupta.
Order! Order!
Now I'd like to call
Shekhar Gupta.
The one whose wife is so crazy,
how can he face anyone?
The poor guy has fled.
- Impossible, Milord.
Shekhar can't leave Damini
in this condition.
I think he's being held
somewhere or to save...
...the Gupta family's honor,
he has been killed!
What rubbish are you talking?
- I'm speaking the truth.
This is impossible, Milord.
No father will kill
his son. - Why not?
Those who can try to kill
a daughter-in-law...
...can also kill their son.
I don't want justice!
Hold yourself, Damini!
The truth will win. We
will get justice.
Which truth? What justice?
I don't want anything.
I don't want anything. - Damini...
Let me speak, Mr. Govind.
Let me speak.
I've seen and heard a lot.
They've made Urmi's rape
a business! Business!
They've made it their
daily bread.
The press has sensationalized
and sold...
...Urmi's story in installments.
Her ruin was made a source
of income by the police!
And the doctor who's considered
another form of God...
...also fled with the money,
leaving Urmi to die.
These people are worse
than vultures...
...preying on living people!
They're hypocrites, cheats,
all of them!
They dress the Goddess' idol
in silken clothes...
...and they strip women outside!
I don't want to prove the
truth to such people.
I don't want to prove the truth.
I saw Urmi's rape, tried
to get justice for her...
...but she was raped in
every nook and corner!
In the police station
and in the court!
She was raped again and again!
Where were the hands,
where were the hands?
On the hands or shoulders?
On the waist or thighs?
How much was she stripped?
These questions were necessary.
But how were they put to me?
And when I was being asked
such filthy questions...
...why was no voice raised?
Where were those brother...
...who move with rakhis (threads)
To protect sisters?
Why is everyone looking
down today?
Why?
That day everyone was
looking at me...
...when Mr. Chadda
was insulting me.
Yes, Mr. Chadda.
The part above the knees
is called thigh.
Even I know that.
Now I ask you. Answer
me, Mr. Chadda.
The part below the neck
is called chest, right?
You're short of hearing,
Mr. Chadda.
So I'll shout and say so that
you can hear clearly.
The part below the neck is
called chest, Mr. Chadda.
This part gives a person
his identity first.
Every mother feeds her baby,
holding it to her chest.
You too must've been
fed, Mr. Chadda.
Would you have asked your
mother or sister...
...the kind of questions
you asked me?
Answer me, Mr. Chadda!
Look at me and answer me!
No! I don't want the truth!
At least Urmi's soul
rest in peace.
I'm taking this case back.
Perhaps... perhaps I was insane
that till now all this...
I am insane.
Send me to the mental
asylum again, Judge.
Perhaps, that's where I belong.
I deserve to be there.
Forgive me, Shekhar. Forgive me.
Damini!
I'm the culprit.
It is true that Urmi was raped.
I saw it.
In my house, my brother
and his friends...
...raped Urmi.
My family and I hid this.
To save our honor.
To save our false honor.
It is also true that
Urmi was murdered.
In this conspiracy, Mr.
Chadda, Mr. Bajaj...
...and my father are involved.
If I've got courage to come
at this shameful moment...
...if I could fight death and
come, the power behind that...
...is in front of me.
Damini.
My wife, Damini.
I'm proud that Damini
is my wife, Milrod.
Damini is my wife.
And I'm proud that
I'm her husband.
Order! Order!
After hearing witnesses and
Shekhar's statement...
...the court concludes that...
...Rakesh and his three friends,
Mahesh Kalia, Anup Arya...
...and Bharat Sabharwal be
sentenced to seven years...
...of rigorous imprisonment each.
For all in the Gupta family
who tried to hide this crime...
...two years in jail.
And Inderjeet Chadda, Kedarnath
Gupta and Tolu Bajaj...
...are being sentenced to seven
years of rigorous imprisonment...
...for the murder of Urmi.
And no proceedings will
be initiated against...
...Shekhar Gupta who has helped
this court to deliver justice.
Order! Order!
Neither I nor this court
deserves this applause.
I ask those who're upset
with the court.
Who delivers justice?
The biggest judge is
your own conscience.
And there's no court in the
world greater than conscience.
If someone has proved Gandhi's
statement true...
...it is Damini.
The law and the court are
grateful to Damini.
In the history of law, this
day and this decision...
...will be known as
Damini's decision.
Come! In Damini's honor,
together with the court...
...let's congratulate Damini
with applause.
