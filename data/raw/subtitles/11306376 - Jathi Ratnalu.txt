Anna, what is this?
It's the company's ID tag.
Heard you have some
big shot job in Hyderabad.
Yeah.
You are great, Anna
Hey, watch it man.
-Hey!
Add two sodas to my tab.
You need to pay me 10 sodas
to take a look at your tab.
Oh man,
What an idiot.
Nobody does anything
but talks big in Jogipet.
They're the first to talk nonsense.
So what's been happening at Jogipet.
What can I say?
Everything's the same.
Every morning that Karim still
wakes us up with those awful songs.
And there's that Mallesh right?
-yeah, yeah
He applied for a KFC license.
Huh...
And because that didn't work out,
he put up a MFC.
And do you know what it stands for?
Mallesh Fried Chicken.
Disgusting,
Not a single piece is edible,
More bone and no flesh.
Nothing changes at Jogipet.
Praveen...
Yeah?
Heard you've bagged
a good job in Hyderabad?
Something like that...
My daughter also stays in Hyderabad.
-Oh
We're thinking of getting her married this year.
-okay
Here, look at her photo.
Let me see...
Having a good job is not enough,
Also watch out for who your friends are.
For the girl's hand in marriage,
all of this comes into consideration.
Yes, right!
And your daughter is
some fine looking actress right?
Hey, let her be.
Jogipet is full of these idiots.
Intelligent people like us
don't belong here.
Hey Praveen....
Yes uncle,
Heard you've bagged some big job,
One selfie, please
-Yeah sure uncle.
Come here,
Ew, get out.
Why are you overreacting?
There are too many jobless
people in Jogipet now.
-oh
At least you keep up the town's reputation.
Okay uncle.
There is no respect here.
I'm not being respected.
Hmm
If I come to the city with you,
Can you please find me a job there?
Will your father agree if you come to city?
Why don't you just here,
happily looking after the ladies' emporium.
SRIKANTH LADIES EMPORIUM
Yeah
Ladies?
Sir...
We're short on female character
for our play 'Sati Ansuya'
Ah,
Ladies Emporium Srikanth is there no?
Put him in the play.
Srikanth
Hmm.
I need to tell you something.
Me too.
I actually...
-Me too...
-Me too..
My fiancÃ© is coming to see me.
He should fall flat, once he sees me.
Could you please select a
matching petticoat and fall for this saree?
Me?
It is in your hands...
-I wonâ€™t, please.
But you have to take a look Srikanth
-Why?
Because...
Whenever any girl sees you in Jogipet,
They're only reminded of
Ladies Emporium Matching.
Vanajakshi...
Vanajakshi...
Are the bangles not matching?
You know everything.
Vanajakshi...
Praveen Anna,
Take a look at this certificates once.
They are teasing me by calling me
ladies emporium Srikanth.
If you set up a job for me in Hyderabad,
Cybera...
Cyberabad Srikanth has a nice ring to it.
10th standard, 60%
intermediate, 50%
and in B.Tech ,40%
What is this?
Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t do M.Tech, Anna
Him,
And a job in Hyderabad?
If anyone in the whole of Jogipet
and Sanga Reddy offers him a job,
Then that person is more
useless than this one.
Daddy, when I sit at the
ladies emporium all day
All my friends are teasing me by calling me
'Ladies Srikanth'
Friends? Who are these friends?
I don't understand...
Why are there no contractions?
Yeah, yeah, the contractions have begun.
What is this?
Scores.
When you were born to the sound
of the pressure cooker only,
I understood that
you were useless
Shekar babu,
It's only because of your kindness,
my daughterâ€™s marriage survived
She learned how much rice
to put in a rice cooker,
The amount of water...
And how to cook the rice.
Thank you, babu.
Shouldn't there be another friend, Uncle?
Skinny and bearded.
Yeah of course he's there.
You've passed out drunk again?
As if you're a 'love failure'
Let's go.
-Ah!
Buttermilk? Let him drink sister,
let him drink.
If he was that drunk
it must have been love failure.
What do you mean?
Should only love failures
get drunk and pass out?
Wait right there.
Hello
Hello Miss
I am 'loving' you.
Ravi?
Yeah, Speak out!
Pour out all the hatred you have for me.
It's not like that Ravi.
Okay,
I get it, I'm a love failure.
My heart is shattered.
If anybody calls for me,
Tell them that I'm at Ganesh wines.
My love is gone
-I was going to tell you...
Ravi!
What perfect
companions he found,
one â€œchote Miaâ€
Hey!
Wait.
It's your gift go.
-Yeah, I'm going.
Uncle, come this side.
Go there, stand next to them.
Itâ€™s our gift, Chintu.
Look, Look at our heroes!
Well rounded zeroes!
Hello Uncle, we've saved
another colour for you.
Come, sit.
Let's all four of us play.
Anywhere in surrounding towns
You cannot find the better clowns
Gift?
To find their worthy peers
You need to wait hundred years
Iâ€™ll get my purse, one minute.
Satellites cannot place
These street rockets
Namaste Amma.
-Namaste Sir
With holes in their pockets
Trash talking Innocents
Worthless than fifty cents
Sleep like there's no tomorrow
Wake like there's no sorrow
Work like a dead sparrow
Look, Look at our heroes!
Well rounded zeroes!
Valueless diamonds
Our precious gems!
Namaste Amma.
-Namaste Sir
-Are you well?
-Yes,
It's been so long since I've seen you around.
Eee! Loverboy,
carry on with your lover!
Okay amma, I'm leaving.
Stay safe.
Loverboy!
Mama,
Who was the first person to
wear jeans pants in Jogipet?
Morning Prayers
Jeans?
Pratap Reddy wore it, dude.
No dude, it was Aziz.
He saw the movie â€œTere Naamâ€
Also, his hair used to be this long.
Hey, that Aziz used to roam
in shorts in front of me.
-That guy and pants?
Santosh Anna wore it first.
Shut up dude.
It was Pratapâ€™s father who
brought jeans from Muscat
for the first time
Santosh brother wore 2 jeans, bro,
after watching â€œGudumba Shankarâ€
How can anyone wear 2 jeans, idiot?
it was Santosh Anna, who introduced
the jeans fashion in Jogipet.
Aziz wore Jeans first in Jogipet.
Evening prayers
Hey, These Aziz and Pratap used to
wear lungis and roam before Santosh Anna.
You know who introduced torn jeans,
Santosh popularized torn jeans.
Sweetheart!
Don't compare them with monkeys
The monkeys will start a strike
If they meditate
The cranes will jump to their fate.
Don't let them run around the town
The clocks will hang themselves
If you are in their sight
You'll be left in your underwear
Anyways, are you offering drink or not
You tell me that first.
Hey, let that be.
The girl, is set.
Is it?
I am thinking of
preparing for IAS seriously.

Thatâ€™s why, I am starting a big shop
on his name, 'Srikanth Ladies Emporium'.
I promise I'll kill myself
under a moving lorry.
Hey...
I will organize your life, my son.
No, I donâ€™t want this kind of life.
I want Praveen anna's life.
I will do a job and wear the
company Id tag too around my neck.
Hey, if you want to wear a tag,
I will get one prepared on
our shopâ€™s name tomorrow.
Customer.
Please come.
Can you please show me some
matching bangles for this saree.
Show me your hand once.
Did you see akka?
Only our Srikanth can set the
matching bangles for saree.
Wasn't the bride beautiful
on Saritha's wedding?
Srikanth only set all the
matching accessories for the saree.
Everybody was praising him.
Srikanth, You have to match the
bangles for the saree function.
Ok Srikanth.
-Ok.
Did you see how famous he is?
All married and unmarried
ladies in and around,
Come to our shop only for him,
So talent and still
you want to go elsewhere?
Hey Srikanth,
I am writing all the
properties to your name right?
OK. Write all the properties to my name.
but don't write
my name on all the properties.
Even if there is a new scheme in India,
offering a job to one person from each family,
he still won't get a job.
Don't you know about him?
That's why,
I will set your life right.
It's okay, I'll set my own life right.
It is my nature.
Look, give me 2 months' time,
Iâ€™ll go to Hyderabad
and get a job.
If I donâ€™t get a job,
I myself will come

whole jungle for you.
Deer, camel.

Walk fast, don't shake it hard.
Your khaki uniform and bullets

If you think you can hold
the whole sun in your palms,

Your ignorance!
In the heart of the patriot,
there are Tamanna, Samantha, and...
Rashmika...
all the 3 together are there.
Oh Sir, rice didnâ€™t boil properly.
Mama,

Hello!
I got a missed call from this number.
Who is it?
Is Ramya there, sir?
Ramya? I donâ€™t know any Ramya.
Oh! sorry sir, wrong number!
You people have a habit of doing
whatever you like and then apologise.
Arre, what is this sir?
Is this how you talk to girls?
Hello!
Donâ€™t teach me how to talk to girls.
Love failure, here.
Do you know how much I drink?
Oh! do you drink daily?
Why, sir?
To heal the broken heart,
I am sacrificing my liver.
Okay, drink if you want,

Add a little soda and drink.
Anyways, did you eat something or not?
Hey, why are coughing?
I got a cough.

I thought it is a snake really, you know.
Oh my! How nice!
-Who? Me?
Hey not you, bald head.
Ok. will call you again.
What sir, why did you shave your head?
My grandmother passed away
Why? Because you shaved?
Jail is very awesome sir.
It is great that Sangareddy
has such a jail.
Wow!
Okay, there are small problems
but for 500 rupees.
Hello. Send those photos to my house.
My parents haven't taken a single
photo of me since I was a kid.
That is my only memory.
Do you understand?
Right sir,
I am going to Hyderabad.
I will keep our Jogipet
name flying high.
Hey Srikanth you're going to the city?
Yes!
Then what about these people?
are these people destined
to be frogs in the well.
They're getting
worse day by day.
Why don't you talk to them?
What can I tell them uncle?
Us matured people, what a job means,
What life is,
What respect means,
These people, really.
Damn!
Hopefulness people.
His father is looking for
wedding matches for him.
That girlâ€™s life-
-Destroyed! Over!
I will give it in writing.
I am afraid of getting married
because of the fear of
having children like these.
Our fate, what can we do?
I will go to Hyderabad now.
I hope your blessing
are always with me.
I'll set something for them
You donâ€™t worry.
I'll take my leave.
Okay
Donâ€™t keep calling me,
I am preparing for Civils.
Kiss his feet!
What Srikanth?
I heard you're going to Hyderabad?
-Yes.
A good match for marriage has come for you.
They are ready to
give 100 grams of gold
and 20 acres of land.
Oh, so they won't give the girl?
-Your friends?
- Ew, no.
They asked me for the
address of the liquor shop,
Go straight and take a left.
Let us go.
-let's go son.
We need to conduct the milk ceremony.
Let's do it Srikanth
-I like doing these things.
Blessings.
-Do well son.
Why are you peeling that off?
Ok I'm leaving.
You shouldnâ€™t say 'Iâ€™m leaving',
you should say 'see you.'
I won't see you again no?
Okay, if you face any issue
there, use my name.
I have no problem.
But, it's a problem for me.
I will earn a job and come back.
Jogipet Srikanth... is no more.
Get used to calling me
Cyberabad Srikanth.
Donâ€™t keep calling me
asking if ate or slept,
and all those things.
Hey Manjula.
I lost my mind for you.
My sis-in-law,
I am your maternal bro-in-law.
Hey, what is all this?
Hello
I'm talking to you.
Can't you hear me? What are you doing?
Hey move man
Hey... hey... hey!
What is all this? Where are you going?
Hyderabad
-Hyderabad?
Nothing will happen because of you.
You don't have any respect at Jogipet.
What will you do after coming to Hyderabad?
Mama, I will cook rice.
-I will get the curries.
I was asking about the job man,
Mama, I donâ€™t have the narrow mind that
I will do only particular kind of job.
I donâ€™t even want any salary mama.
If you give me food and shelter,
thatâ€™s enough.
It is better to give salary to you rather
than providing food and shelter.
I am going for a job
and to earn respect,
Why do you want all those?
Why do only you need a job and respect?
We need a job too.
Mama, please...
I'm out of money Mama.
I even sold my ring.
Hey, Ravi is here man.
So I need to sell my chain also then.
Letâ€™s go then.
Thu.
Please behave decently
like me in Hyderabad.
If you donâ€™t cook rice & curries,
I will kill you.
Regular or Basmati?
Where is our room, buddy?
You know Nagarjuna's (top Hero) Annapurna studios?
After crossing it you'll pass Chiranjeevi's

Beside that is our room, ROYAL VILLAS

Our adjoining house is
Chiranjeeviâ€™s house mama.
Both of us share the same current bill
Same?
-Curr ... Current ..
Even finding this in the colony is a lot.

Yeah.

Yep.

Only two people can sleep under the fan.
Just for the safe side,
WhatsApp me your Aadhar and voter ID.
Royal Villas is known for its neatness.
Should not behave like cheapskates.
Room should be maintained like
a well-polished mirror. Understood?
Mama, I will go to Jogipet.
I find it better than your house, Mama.
Daddy!
What happened dude?
No... No...
-What were you saying?
I dare you to say it again
No Anna
-Say it once again?
What happened?
Even if a room like this
has conditions and regulations,
I couldn't stand it, bro.
Let him go.
Get out of here.
How dare you beat my son?
I dare you to find a room here.
Get out of here.
Tell me.
-All because of you.
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,
I will leave from here.
He's the one who gave the love letter
to my daughter on the road.
No, No.
I will pluck your eyes out
and tie them on the clock tower.
No, it was a small mistake.
What mistake?
This one was supposed to give the letter,
but by mistake that one gave it.
It's confusion, please drop it.
What? How dare you raise your hand?
All this is because of you.
Sir...
-Hey...
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,
I will leave from here.
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,
I will leave from here.
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,
I will leave from here.
Leave me.
Where will we go now?
Why did you get so angry?
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,
I will leave from here.
Go.
You're the one causing the problem.
I challenged my father and came here.
I canâ€™t go back to Jogipet with this face.
I'll be here whether I live or die.
So it looks like you're destined for death.
Nature
Jogging
Good morning.

Anna, what are you doing here?
I'm doing accounts,

In this apartment.
Oh my.
I've been roaming around
speaking of
the star of Jogipet,
Praveen Anna.
And you're getting toilets cleaned?
You don't even have a tag?
I trusted you and came to Hyderabad,
after fighting with my father.
Saying I'd get a job in two months.
Do you know that we slept
on the road the whole night?
What do you want me to then?
You spoke about some flats right,
Please look for a room
for us, temporarily.
I donâ€™t know anything man.
Please, just for a few days.
We don't have a room to stay at,
We've been sleeping on the roads

These are very rich apartments
The owners of these apartments also don't live here.

That's some battered down car,
and we need a parking space for it.
It's a Luna sir.
It's fitted with auto tires
and run with a cycle chain.
Hey, you potty mouth.
Sir to be a neighbour is to
offer our parking spot to you,
your turkey towels to us,
They lack the common sense to know this.
small town fellows.
I will explain it to them,

You are getting late for the exam,
I apologise on behalf of them.

Welcome sir.
Sir, sir.
People are struggling without jobs.
Namaskar sir.
Older companies are shutting down.

the revenue ministry.
Please don't mind.
If you donâ€™t mind,
I'll take the sports ministry
that he has rejected.

-I will slap your cheek (champa).
Sorry.
Chitti?
Chitti is fixed- right I'm leaving.
Put all the goods in the go down outside.
Sir, sir. Hello sir.
I have come for an interview, sir.
Here, there no jobs available here.
Sir, I will do any job,
Sir please see if there is any availability.
There have been no contracts for 6 months
and the work has stopped.
The owner is paying our salaries
from his own pockets.
For you to get a job now will be very difficult.
I donâ€™t have problem even
if owner pays me from his own pocket, sir.
Sir,
-go, leave.
Forget about the payment of salaries.
Apparently, you're not even able
to pay the electricity bills.
Think about it.
Nothing to think about.
This company was founded by my father.
What can you offer,
India's first electronics company?
all these long tales...
Haven't received any orders
for the past year.
Before the bank forcefully
forfeit your company,
Call us when you think of our offer.
You can leave now.
Sir
that offer,
I mean...
you have to think about your family too, sir.
No Srinivas, we must not lose.
2000 people's lives.
my fatherâ€™s dream,
I will not be defeated.
Here is your advance.
Advance?
Close it.
What is this?
Come here,
I got some secret
information that
the Indo-Asian games are
taking place in our city.
Oh my,
The plan is to give the
contract to their company,
a round figure of 500 crores will be ours.
500 crores?
If you are startled for everything,
I will punch you.
If you take the oath as the
Sports Minister,
And sign that contract,
the balance amount 400 crores
will be released.
I have waited all my life
for a chance like this.
Now there are no more
obstacles in the plan.
Don't know how she'll respond.
Psst..
Psst..
Psst..
What should I do?
*wolf whistles*
You said you'd slap me if I called
you the wrong name,
So I tried making a sound.
You're Ratnamala right?
Huh?
Do you at least fill your
name out on admission forms?
Or do you keep them guessing?
Chitti.
Chitti.
How many times I have to tell you?
Don't record yourself dancing
and send it for auditions.
What about my reputation?
Hello Sir,
What reputation sir?
Could your reputation at least bag you
a fake 10th standard certificate?
What shit...
No, so why does reputation matter sir?
Chitti, if you record your dance again
and send it for auditions,
I will settle the American match for you
and pack you away
Sir, she's a dancing peacock sir.
Sir, your daughter is
â€œManikonda Madhuri Dixitâ€
Tie anklets to those legs,
not shackles sir.
Do you even know what you're talking about?
Sir,
Sir, if she'd kicked you with
those legs when she was young...
-So what?
-So what?
So what?
-So what?
-So...
Say something man.
Finish the dialogue.
You can't understand your own daughter?
What will you understand
if I finish my dialogue?
She is a small girl sir,
You need to understand her.
What she likes to study,
The boy she likes,
Chitti, who is this
half smoked cigarette butt to interfere?
Sir,
Sir, I am also responsible
citizen Kane of country
because of awareness
of 'Beti Bachao'.
Oh Chitti--
Why are you in this place
with such indecent people?
I'm going crazy,
Oh! What nonsense am I talking Chitti?
Come on, letâ€™s go.
My language has changed
after two minutes here.
Tie anklets to your daughterâ€™s legs
not shackles!
Once upon a time there was thirsty crow.
No matter what, city beer is city beer.
Hi.
Oh god.
Uh...
Hi.
Hi.
Is this yours?
It got delivered to our flat by mistake.
Jogipet was written on it, so...
Oh. This is ours.
Is it delivered to your flat?
No problem.
-Thank you so much.
Okay I'm leaving.
Have a beer -
c-c-c-coffee and leave
No, not now, another time.
It's the first time you've come here.
Just five minutes.
Come.
Okay.
What do you do?
Ladies emporiu...
-Empowerment.
Ladies empowerment.
I do as much as I can for it.
I keep trying.
You are great.
What about your job?
Currently I'm struggling.
You Sir?
I am also struggling.
And you?
I have been struggling from my childhood.
Our parents do not trust us.
When I passed my 10th class,
my father did not believe it.
He was shocked.
Why your father, even I was also shocked.
He's always ready to crack
jokes in front of girls,
Like a dog in front of a mutton shop.
Hey, I will put on some rice, not coffee
Heat the morning's coffee and serve it.
Mama, the girl came home!
And from tomorrow onwards,
I'll be a Banjara Hills
(posh locality in Hyderabad) son-in-law.
Now we can delete Jogipet from our life.
You don't know what delete means right?
It means remove.
Donâ€™t behave like Jogipet
boy before that girl,
behave a well-mannered
man like me.
I prepared it.
-Thanks.
Only one.
-Oh, sorry.
This apartment suits me well.
I would like to settle in
this Hyderabad climate.
Is it?
-Yes.
But I want to settle in a village.
Tell me if your Jogipet is good,
I will take a farmhouse
and settle there.
When would he go back to Jogipet?
He deleted it long back.
Your face-
Jogipet is Jogipet.
Some rando-
Oh, it's my father.
-Sorry, one minute.
-Yeah.. yeah..
Hello father.
Did you open the package?
Yeah, it's here,
What did you send?
On the eve of
the Ladies' Festival,
we want to invite all
the married women...
and want to open
a ladiesâ€™ emporium
by the name â€œSrikanth
ladiesâ€™ emporiumâ€
What do you say?
Yeah, yeah.
I will tell you.
If you send photos like these again,
I will kill you.
I am in a meeting.
Hey-all these ladies are
waiting for you here.
Cut the call.
Oh man.
Yes, father your blessings
are enough for me.
Right.
My father.
He asks me to do things I don't like.
It's difficult for me.
What does your father do?
Aaaa... Army.
Idiot, take some medicine
Sorry
He says that I have an army body.
Something happened to him, check on him
Just because somebody
has an army body
does that mean they
have to join the army?
He doesn't listen to me.
What do you do?
I like to dance a lot.
But I'm doing some other
course for my father.
But I have zero knowledge in it as well.
I just cheat and pass my exams.
Is it?
Even I'm crazy about dancing.
Is it?
There's not a single
function in town where I don't dance.
Vijayawada, Marpha, Teenmar
(local dance forms)
I am trained in everything.
Trained?
Yes.
That's a very exciting sound for him.
Tea is very tasty, but...
That is coffee.
You seem like a really good man.
People would think you're a good man,
looking at you.
Huh?
-huh?
What do you mean?
I'm really a good man.
Go type 'goodness' on Google,
The results will show 'searching for Srikanth'.
Okay bye, Vishnupriya.
Hey..
Sorry, is it Krishna Veni right?
Okay
How come you called me Chitti that day?
You want me to you tell the truth?
I don't know why, but I felt like
calling you Chitti when I saw you.
Is it a problem?
If not, can I call you Pinki?
That is...
My Chitti,
Shamili...
Shamili...
My name is not Shamili.
My name is Chitti.
Amma!
There's nobody there to call you
Chitti anymore.
Chitti.
Sorry.
Hello sir, have you received your package?
I will take it if you give it to me.
What sir? How can you suspect me?
We're a family that would
give our lives for loyalty.
So you won't give packages?
Shamili madam.
You took the package from me
to give it to sir,
Didn't you give it to him?
You said it was delivered
to your flat by mistake.
Hey.
Oh my.
Will you give your number
by mistake as well, Shamili?
It's okay. You can call me Chitti.
Oh chitti your smile
Is an atomic missile
When it goes off
My heart gets shattered
When you twist and turn around,
It's like a signal that you approve of me.
Yes you've come into my sight
In my darkest night
And turned on a flood light
I've started to like you.
And I like you a lot.
I was just a guy who's black and white
You filled me with colors so bright
O chitti my bulbul chitti
Hi
Hi.
Chitti, I have to tell you something
Tell me.
But you shouldn't mind it.
I won't mind.
Tell me.
No. you will definitely mind.
It's okay. Tell me.
I told you I have to tell you something,
And told you not to mind,
And you still don't
know what's in my heart?
Even when you're so hesitant
I'm telling you I won't mind
Yet, you canâ€™t understand
what's in my heart?
Aye, Chitti
Chitti
Sweetheart!
Son-in-law of Banjara hills.
Come here.
Come here bey!
Hey....

You stare angrily
in the beginning.
Then you slowly come dancing.
Right?
Come on sir. come.
Hey
-Get out bey.
Sorry sir, sorry.
No battles were fought
No horses were slashed
Just with your sweet smile
You made me victorious
You are queen Elizabeth
And I am a just a nobody
I fixed the carbonator sir.
But you still voted for my common man heart
Come on sir,
Ride our vehicles to once in a while.
And booked a flight
from your palace to my slums
It's nice.
It would be great if someone
called me right now.
Heh?
Hey. I am at Taj Banjara,
will call you later.
Right!
I've said it.
You're like Google maps,
And showed me the way to your heart
O you gave off your heart to me!
You've become a an onion garnish
to my fritter like life
You've pierced my heart,
O you pierced me
with your love tattoo so deep!
You sprinkled a delicious lemon
In my biryani
O chitti my bulbul chitti
Chitti my chulbul chitti
When you squeeze both my cheeks to kiss
I lose my balance
Oh chitti my jiljil chitti
Chitti my redbull chitti

Really?
Indeed sir.

It was a fake prison sir.
What are these?

Are you terrorists?
Hey Inspector!
Itâ€™s a love failure case...
Yes. Thatâ€™s right sir.
The shop owner gave 10 sim cards
when we bought one.
You can take one sir.
They came for Aadhar card verification.

Sir, sir.
Sir, please donâ€™t create a scene here.
If you want, tell me the location,

Verification has become very strict
Hey Chitti, you go upstairs.
I will call you.
Hey, move.

Hey, where are you going?
I will bring my charger, sir.
Sir, please listen to me.
Arey, please listen to me.
Sir,

Namas-
I am very innocent, sir.
I donâ€™t know anything...
Your lie should at least be believable.
You have to tell....
You have to tell me.
We're trying to meet each other,
but we are not meeting.
-Yeah
Actually,
I've come out of station fr some work.
Police Station?

Hey, my mother is coming,

Really?
Okay,
You cut the call.
No, you cut the call.
I won't cut the call, you do it.
Hey, cut the call.
Do you know how big a case we're stuck in?
No one will ever know even
if they kill us in the lockup.
What will they do to us?
Sir how many years
would we be imprisoned for this case?
14 years!!
But because we're good people,
they'll look at our decent behaviour and..
Can they reduce it by 10-12 years?
They won't? Okay.
Chitti will get married
during those 14 years
Hey boys, someone named
Chitti is here for you
It's true love.
Chitti,I now know what love is,
and the value of love.
Even when all these people suspect me,
You trusted me and came here,
That's enough.
Thatâ€™s enough for me.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Do you also suspect me?
You've been lying to me from the beginning.
What did I say?
You said, your father was in the military,
Chi...
That's a sma-
You suspect me of a murder
for such a small thing?
Are you insane?
What is your father saying?
He said good riddance.
Huh.
You didn't tell your father,
that I'm a good person
who tells small lies?
If he lies about the small things,
what would he do about the bigger things?
Is it your father saying all this?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
What do you think about me then?
There's no love here Sujatha.
Chitti....
Pinky!
Srikanth?
-Sujatha?
Hey, listen....
Just get hell and heaven out of from me.
Just...
Go to hell-en.
Don't let the door
hit you on your way out.
"I am the king of the thiefâ€™s street...."
Move aside, uncle...
"Standing like a post,
is it a lady or cell tower?"
Passion of the Christ.
How old is this?
You won't update yourself
when I ask you to.
Please don't keep visiting.
I felt a little homesick, sir.
The situation is not great outside.
Some viral fever,
Fever and body pains,
Who will take care of me
if something happens to me?
If I stay here,
you will take care of me,
slight trust, safety.
Don't I have it?
Hey Chinna...
fresh?
You look like a juicy ice apple.
What did you do?
Wait let me guess.
As far as I know,
You got down a running bus
and the police caught you.
Donâ€™t be embarrassed.
I came from the same situation.
You won't believe me.
When I myself complained to the police
that I lost my drugs,
They beat the hell out of me
in a 6 X 6 room.
My career began then.
I have seen the peaks.
From the information
coming to us,
MLA Chanakya sirâ€™s
condition is critical.
Oh, is his condition that serious?
He won't even laugh at a joke?
How is MLA Chanakya sir?
His condition is very critical...
We canâ€™t say anything now.
Have to tell us now.
Fans
Donâ€™t play games inside the four walls.
If you have the guts,
bring our leader out
before everybody and
do a postmortem.
I will see, how he won't live.
Breaking News.
MLA Chanakya has
just regained consciousness
For all the well wishers-
Greetings.
He survived
Because I still have to do
service to the people,
God has saved me.
If you ask them to speak,
they'll give long speeches.
Today before the media,
I'm going to name all
the people who've
attempted to murder me.
Big names will come out rolling,
you just watch.
Srikanth!
Srikanth means you no?
Ravi
And Shekhar.
These three people who've
recently moved into our apartment,
attempted to murder me.
Oh my.
Grand debut, man.
Notice: To exhibit
real incidents,
some events are filmed
using actors and actresses.
Jogipet Srikanth
Me?
Jogipet Ravi
Jogipet Sekhar
Is that supposed to be me?
To be frank, he looks better than you, Mama
Pickpocketing in Sanga Reddy,
Their criminal life began
with the drug mafia.
Who are these people?
They'll go through any lengths
for small pleasure.
Bro, give me thirty rupees
worth of chicken.
30 Rupees,Anna?
Yep.
Give me the liver
You won't even get this
plastic bag for thirty rupees,
how will you get liver?
Then give me neck pieces.
Hey you wonâ€™t get
anything for thirty rupees.
Why not!
Jogipet Shekhar....
Tired of the petty crimes,
and with a plan to make it big,
They shifted to Hyderabad.
As soon as they reached Hyderabad,
they raised hell.
We don't know what
they've planned,
but entered a posh apartment.
Umm...
They gate crashed MLA Chanakya's party
And while they were trying to steal money,
they shot MLA Chanakya,
who was trying to stop them.
Happy Birthday my boy
Jogipet Shekhar.
But who are these people really?
Let's talk to people who know them well.
They would hit the pigeons
perched on the electrical wires
with beer bottles
I knew it the moment they arrived here sir,
that they belong here.
Death is fun for them, sir.
I haven't been able to sleep since then.
I'm still taking sleeping tablets sir.
Ravi, your mother is here.
We really didn't do anything.
What is all this?
At least tell now,
why did you want to kill the MLA?
Huh? Why would we kill him?
Lies everything is a lie,
you said you'd go for a movie,
and eloped with the sarpanch's daughter.
Aunty, please not here.
You said you's hunt wild boar,
took those guns,
and what did you?
Last year, you said you were
going to Tirupathi.
But you went to Goa, got sloshed and
got caught by the police.
Get out.
Leave immediately.
Okay, I'll leave,
If you think I'm the one
causing the problem,
I'll leave from here.
Is your entire family like this?
Whatâ€™s your name?
Sir,
Whatâ€™s your name?
As in like an attendance register,
or what they call me otherwise?
How many names do you have?
Srikanth.
What is your name?
Pasupuleti Shekhar.
What is your name?
Hey your name?
Ravi.
Why did you go to the party uninvited?
We thought maybe he forgot to invite us.
What?
We thought maybe he forgot to invite us.
Is that how one goes to a party?
I think so.
Then why did you go?
I went to eat Murgh Masallum, sir.
What did you think of doing with body?
We thought of burying it.
Hey, shut up.
I am talking no?
Listen-
He is a fool, sir,
He doesnâ€™t know anything, sir.
We weren't going to bury it sir,
I swear, please believe me.
We thought we'd stuff
the corpse in the boot
and throw it in the lake.
Hey, shame on you.
Why do you lie so much?
Sir, I swear.
We thought of cutting
the body into pieces
and parceling it.
Hey you dimwit,
when did we agree upon that?
Hey, why are you pouncing on me?
Hey...
But the three of you agreed
upon getting rid of the body?
Yes, sir.
Correct...
exactly
Wow, sir is super intelligent.
So you've done something like this before?
No sir, this is our first time.
First time?
Ah...
It isnâ€™t that first time...
First time...one...
water...feeling thirsty, sir
I will go back to Jogipet sir.
We really are-
You remind me of my father sir,
He's just like you.
The water's not good, let it be.
Hey,leave it there.
My head-
Replace the cap.
Hey, you're claiming to be innocent right?
You're entire history is in this.
Do you get it?
Hey
Is this a joke to you?
What are you doing here man?
Who are you threatening over the phone?
Who are you blackmailing?
Ah...ah...that was,
I said I would cook rice
and asked him whether he
would get the curries sir,
Okay, You are innocent.
Why didnâ€™t you inform the police?
I mean if we tell the police,
they'd make a mess out of it no sir?
That's why we decided against it.
I will now show you
my type of interrogation!
Oh my.
Do you understand?
Understood sir.
Where is the toilet, sir?
I have loaded 0.5 mg.
You can start your
interrogation within 2 minutes.
What actually happened on the birthday?
Birthday?
Do you hold any small grudges?
Why not sir?
Sir, to be frank I'm not getting high
with the medicine.
Thatâ€™s a very strong dose, sir.
If we give more,
he may go into coma.
Do you know how experienced I am, with alcohol?
Right from the local Jogipet liquor
to foreign scotches.
Where is your den?
Where do you meet each other?
Srikanth Ladies Emporium...
None of these will work sir.
We stitch pico and falls here.
Matching bangles for
pattu langas also 'alaivable'
I will kill that guy.
Whom?
The character who acted in the TV serial
â€œNeralu â€“ Ghoraluâ€
No man, do you have
any resentments against anybody?
Vanajakshi.
Sir, actually,
we are from Jogipet.
We thought of taking
a room in Hyderabad.
I will kill that person.
She used me to match all her
accessories for her wedding,
Anklets, bangles, clothes...
Under the pretext of
those top stars,
he took us to Royal Villas.
But on her wedding day,
nothing she ware was matching,
She soiled my reputation sir.
They kicked us out because
I hit the owner's son.
I hate you, Vanajakshi.
The world has gone to the dogs, baldy.
Vanajakshi
I hate her sir.
Didnâ€™t you say you'd kill him,
in front of everybody when you were drunk?
He said it sir.
Hey said it only once.
Why did you want to kill me?
Tell me or I'll kill you.
You didn't feed me cake.
We cut a cake on your birthday
You feed the guy next to you.
Not just once.
On multiple occasions.
That's why,
I got so angry that I wanted to shoot you.
But I didn't shot you.
Hey
What man?
-after everything you did.
did everything you could...
Stop it.
Leave.
Brother, it was really the cake-
Leave!
The number you've called is switched off.
What happened sir?
Why do you look so worried?
Do you know who the judge is?
Justice Balwant Chaudhary.
Your Honor,
This is basically an open and shut case.
These three,
Were caught red handed
trying to stash MLA Chanakya's
dead body in the car.
I will ask them a few questions
for the sake of formality.
Stand properly.
Why did you come to Hyderabad?
To settle-
For settlements and
other illegal activities sir.
Hey, no sir.
-N..Noo sir.
Generally the youth parties in a pub or a restaurant,
Then why did you go to the jail?
For fun
Fun? For them
going to jail is fun, your honor.
Oh! No, no sir.
-No, sir.
What was your exact reaction
when you saw the body?
What else sir, we thought we'd bury him
Oh,
Do you feel like you've done something wrong?
Why will it be there, sir?
Oho!
Are you at least feeling any remorse?
No sir, nothing at all.
Oh.
Even after all this,
And without a morsel of guilt,
They're worse than the hard-core criminals.
Without any mercy shown on them,
we hope the court punishes them severely.
Sir... sir... sir....
Do you have a lawyer to defend you?
We will defend our case ourselves,
your honor.
Why don't you pass the
judgment also yourself,
Why are we even here, let's leave, come.
Sir, sorry sir.
It just come out in a flow.
Sir, there's a new lawyer here
to speak on behalf of them
Oho.
I have zero
knowledge on the subject.
Huh?
Somehow I manage to pass by cheating.
Really?
We'll defend our own case sir
We beg you, sir, please.
Chitti
Give it to them sir,
Give them bail.
He give them a bail,
Give it, the lawyer madam is asking for it.
You are a lawyer, right?
That's why you need to
say something or the other.
Sir, No the law is nobody's family
Ah, so what?
So...
So between the struggle
between the law and justice...
Talk about the case please
No Chitti, please
I beg you please.
A 100 criminals may escape
but one innocent man-
Really?
Aha,
Come to the bench.
Which college?
College...
Fake certificate.
Have you read-
a book-
or at least a page about law?
I watched the movie Lawyer Suhasini twice.
Aha
Hah....
This is my last case.
Oh! this is my first case, sir.
Oh!
It is evident....
Along with movie dialogues,
Please mention a few Section numbers.
Otherwise it'll fall onto me.
Okay sir...
Donâ€™t say anything more.
Sir, it is true that they went
to the party on that day.
Aah,tell him Chitti, you're in a good flow.
It is also true that they went to
eat â€œMurgh Musallamâ€
Correct, correct tell them.
Indeed, it is true that MLA's body
was found in their room.
Aah...
Lastly, the fact that they
wanted to kill the MLA is also-
Hey Chitti.
-What? What are you saying?
I mean sir,
If they really had come here from Jogipet,
and had they thought of a
perfect plan to murder the MLA.
If they thought of it...
If they thought of it...
-if we thought of it?
If they thought of it.
Finish the sentence, Chitti
Sir, she has more to say.
She's not done yet,
By 'if they thought of it' is
something lawyers open with sir.
If we had thought of
it doesnâ€™t mean we actually did it.
According to section 113H and 10Y,
give them, please grant them sir,
Grant those poor things bail.
After listening to the arguments,
I feel like I've heard nothing,
I'm adjourning the case.
-Sir.
Instead of quoting sections numbers,
and by quoting numbers from the city buses,
I warn Lawyer Shamili,
for side-tracking the court.
Her words have only increased the suspicion
on these three men.
Sir, sir, sir.
The court orders that
the culprits be shifted
from their current jail
to Chanchal Guda Jail.
Sir, we havenâ€™t done anything, sir.
Please donâ€™t shift to us to
Chanchal Guda jail, sir.
Please sir, please sir.
The current jail we're in is fine sir.
Move,
Please listen to me, sir.
Sir, that girl is a devil, sir...
Donâ€™t shift us to Chanchal Guda jail sir.
Sir, she's not even a lawyer sir.
Susheela, are you happy
that you've trapped us?
Donâ€™t shift to us Chanchal Guda jail, sir.
They're trapped like parrots
in Chanchalguda Jail
They've become numbers on a slate now
They flew towards the
sky aiming for stars
fate kicked them in the butt
They fell right in to the hole
They now understand all those sad songs.
They used to eat butter
Now they're eating dirt.
God knows what's gonna happen now
Such colour dreams were dreamt that,
The heart has found some unknown hope
How carefree the fish was
in the cool water,
But now it's being scaled
to be cooked in fire.
Such lazy lives they used to lead
Now they are carrying a big load
on their heads
And are made to run everywhere.
What king size lives they used to lead!
What king size lives they used to lead!
Now their life is a big mess
They've been pushed into their own graves
Oh son! Whatever you touch becomes a disaster
It's the god's will
You didn't value home when you were there
Now with a simple twist of fate,
look how your story has changed
Prisoner clothes,
criminal gangs
and these four walls
are now your friends
Hey, Gaddalakonda Ganesh.
I am so happy to see you here
Thanks Anna
No matter what, great achievement man,
Respect.
When I look at you
I feel like I'm looking into a mirror.
Hey, they're from our clan.
He is Shankar, cheating case.
Oh, nice to meet you.
He is Mastan, murder attempt.
Oh no, namaste.
The best batch in Chanchal Guda jail
was our batch.
2008 batch
Oh my! everybody was a diamond.
You see that ground over there...
You can do any work there.
If you take one full round,
You'll burn 200 calories.
You see that right?
You can gossip with your
cellmates there in the evenings.
You won't even remember your wife.
The next batch will get good facilities,
Western toilets, tissue papers.
The only lurking fear is for
when they'll send you out of this jail
for good behaviour.
You guys won't be sent.
Have you had the tea?
Goat milk, it's healthy.
SRIKANTH CHITTI
The clean mirror which was your life
Has been shattered to pieces
It should come crawling to me.
Srikanth.
the emporium has shut down
just as you had wanted.
Hmm
Look
criminals, 420s
If were at Jogipet right now,
Karim would have been waking us up
with his Kishore Kumar songs.
What great songs they were.
Then we would have gone to Mallesh's shop
and had some chicken.
MFC
There's no better chicken.
Chitchat with friends at the Clock Tower
in the evenings
Manjeera Dam love failures,
Everybody's always asking about us
Srikanth,
When is are you holding
a function at our house?
There wasn't function I wasn't at, in Jogipet.
Will we go back to Jogipet?
Sir, the last call from this
phone went to this girl.
Umm...
Hello.
Tell me.
You have to tell...
You have to tell me.
What did you eat?
Tomato daal and brinjal curry.
From frogs in the well,
we have become crabs in the lake.
Hey, you have been granted bail.
Bail?
Who granted us bail?
If I don't tell you, then you won't leave?
We won't leave.
Then stay here.
Sir
Who is putting us behind bars...
Who is bailing us out?
Life has become a zindagi sir.
Letâ€™s go.
Hey, get into the car.
Aah...
Who is he talking to?
Hey, I'm talking to you,
Get into the car.
Itâ€™s okay, sir. We'll take an auto
Oho, apparently they're forcing us in.
Hey come on.
Donâ€™t be scared, come.
Hey move come,
Hey...
Do you need a special invitation?
Hey Mama,
why does everybody look so peculiar?
Hey, you please keep quiet.
If these guys kills us and then bury us?
There's nothing in my life to gossip about.
Hey, donâ€™t fear.
Even after bringing us to such a big den,
They've still not tied our hands to a chair
and interrogated us,
Then they're not very dangerous people.
Aah...
I mean these guys are better,
In the other dens, the blindfold you.
Where is the phone?
Where is the phone?
-It's switched off sir.
Who amongst you is Ravi?
Him onlt, he's Ravi.
Hello,

my phone last night?
Your girlfriend, your lover,

Suvarna...
Yeah, to speak with Suvarna
Yes.
Why are blushing?
Why were you using his phone you idiot?
Hmm?
I mean, sir's phone.
Tell where him it is?
Please, try to remember.
You know I forget the person
who serves me drinks also when I'm drunk.
I'm really disturbed Mama.
I can't remember anything.
Oh god...
Hey, what are you thinking?
What do you remember?
Tell me.
Sir, generally...
the process in such dens?
No man, please.
What den? What process?
What are you talking about?
I mean, do you cook the rice
before you get the curries,
Or do you get curries first
and then cook the rice?
No!
Hey! It'll hurt, please.
Don't hit me.
Okay, one minute,
I'll tell you when I'm ready.
Ah! it hurts, okay let me come out.
Let's discuss this once.
I have stitches on my stomach
from an operation.
It hurts a lot please let me be.
Okay, stop, I remember, I need to talk to Chanakya sir.
One minute, I remember, I'll tell him.
Sir, please ask them not to hit me.
I'll find your phone, please.
Give me one chance.
Just one chance.
Tell me
Sir, thanks sir.
Let's recreate what happened that night,
The exact same situation, step by step.
My friend will remember
where you lost your phone.
Please don't mind sir,
He's had memory problem since he was kid.
Please sir, just once chance.
Ready sir, hey try hard to remember.
Okay, mama
First, we walked into the birthday party
in full spirit.
Hey Mama!
Today we have to eat, drink and
enjoy ourselves to the fullest.
Hey wait man,
Ultimately the politicians' money
is ours no?
Haa.... Haa... Haa... Haa... Haa....
100% true.
You werenâ€™t aware of all this, sir
You were cutting the cake then.
Happy Birthday to sir...
Happy birthday to sir....
Did you remember anything?
Happy Birthday to sir, Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to Chanakya,
Sir.... Very...Happy...
Eat, take, eat man.
And then?
And then we wished you
lived for a hundred years
and left for our flat.
there we found your body in our flat, sir.
What did you do in that gap, sir?
Yeah sir, what did you do?
Hey, why do we need all those details?
Powerful people have
a lot on their plate,
cakes, bullets,
Did you remember, bro?
Tch. I don't know man,
my mind is stuck.
I can't remember anything.
Okay. Next, we will enact the part
where we carried your body.
Hey, I will stake my life against
my brother-in-lawâ€™s life.
Then you come sir, please.
We were discuss whether to
chop you into pieces or
throw you in the river.
Hey, I got it.
While I was going this way,
I picked up the phone
and called Suvarna.
That was my phone.
Now, you are saying
that you donâ€™t know.
Hello, um... tell me.
You have to tell me.
Um...you have to tell me.
Have you eaten?
What have you eaten?
Yes.
Tomato man, you?
I ate a tomato as well.
Yesterday Tomato, today also Tomato
is it your favourite thing?
Ha, yours?
ridge gourd man.
Hey,how much more of this tomato,
ridge gourd nonsense.
Tell me, what happened next?
That's all.
Do you remember?
Sir done sir.
Let's recreate the cramming of the body in the car.
If you donâ€™t mind,
one minute,
I can't hold it in any longer.
Go and come.
I will do it. Hey, who is that fellow?
Hey...Ba... Ba... brother â€“in-law.
I will bear this nonsense
only till I find my phone.
Okay
Once the phone is found,
get all three of them crushed
under the tipper lorry.
Okay, brother-in-law.
Heee...
If by any chance the phone
falls into Ramachandriah's hands,
My political career goes kaput.
Kaput!
Hey, don't stuff me in.
Here we crammed the body in
the boot sir. And then,
Something happened
But I canâ€™t remember
Hey, you can't remember anything!
Sir, he was completely sloshed then sir.
Ignore his words.
Actually, this re-creation
is not working out.
He wasn't that sloshed.
Hey!
You don't remember how drunk he was.
Try to remember.
He was stinky we kept
the body in the boot,
We were so stressed out
we were unable to do anything,
And got onto the vehicle.
yes sir, we went from the side,
Are you mad?
Sir, I wasnâ€™t completely zonked out.
and then we sat down.
Where is Ravi man?
I have the capacity to consume
2 full bottles and 4 beers.
If I sit down till the sun rises.
I was not completely zonked.
I winked at him no?
I winked as well.
I winked to let you know that
It looks like they're going to kill us,
Let's get out of here quickly.
and get that Ravi along.
Thereâ€™s so much depth behind a wink Mama.
He was not in a position to talk sir,
He fainted sir,
I'll kill him man.
They are not allowing me to speak sir.
We threw him into the back sat
because he was
becoming a problem,
Allow me to tell....
Go inside.... go inside...
That's when the power went,
We couldn't see anything,
So I slid inside and shut the door like this...
Wasn't that recreation brilliant?
Sai Wines should be around here,
can you please stop there?
Couldn't you understand why I was winking?
When I went to pee,
They were making a plan to kill us.
Apparently there were some
videos in the phone.
They're scared for their lives
about the videos going public.
This is our chance.
If we find that phone.
He will listen to what we say.
We can first ask him to drop
the case against us.
Hey, please, tell where that phone is?
I beg you, please.
Hey, not through the gate,
his party members are there.
Watchman, watchman!
Come here.
Hey watchman
Here he is,
Hey, where is our vehicle?
I donâ€™t know, sir.
Aah, aren't you the watchman,
Who will know, if not for you?
Just because I'm the watchman,
doesn't mean I have to
watch only your car.
This guy only must have stolen the vehicle,
I swear on my mother, I don't know.
Sir, I'd lose my job,
please don't tell anybody here.
Who could have stolen the car?
I really don't know sir.
Hey, his phone must have fallen in the boot.
Those rowdies will be here,
Let's get out of here.
Mama, let me go meet Chitti once.
I don't know if I can meet her later.
Now?
-Please.
I don't know if I can meet her again.
Life has a become a zindagi
And there's only one zindagi.
Hmm...pointed to be noted, your honor.
Chitti.
Srikanth!
Yeah.
Itâ€™s very cold...
I didn't think you'd
be able to get out of jail.
Even I didn't think it was possible
after your arguments, Kamakshi
Srikanth, you are still angry with me, no?
Huh....
Tch
I agreed that I was wrong no?
Oho!
Finally got some sense into your head.
It's okay, you realized
your mistake at least.
That's why I'm trying the fix
the mistake I made, all by myself.
What do you mean?
I thought I could of present
my arguments before court again.
I will plead guilty.
Hey!
If you plead guilty,
you'll be sentenced for.
Will be lesser than the term
I will get if you defend me, Subalakshmi
Oh my, oh my.
You have no feeling of love towards me.
Did you even miss me?
What are you saying Srikanth?
Whenever I read about any
criminal in the newspaper,
you come to my mind
Do you know that?
Really?
Even I wrote only your name
all over the prison walls.
Psst.
Chitti all our clothes have gotten dirty,
Can I borrow your father's clothes?
my Father-in-lawâ€™s suit and boots
Can't you always wear a suit?
Decent, like my father.
If you put my Chanchal Guda
cellmate also in a suit,
He'd look more decent than your father.
As if your dad is some Dec-
Hah!
Really?
Tell me son, tell me.
Something about your
colleagues and cellmates.
It wasn't about you uncle.
Uncle?
Sorry, father-in-law.
Father-in-law?
Hey, you're talking to Satish Janardhan,
Okay Satish
What is this Chitti? Why are you talking
to this bloody criminal?
Excuse me Satish,
according to Indian constipation,
I am still uncriminal till proof.
Hey, it's the constitution.
Are you even qualified enough
to talk to my daughter?
Do you even know what sort of
matches I've found for her?
Aah...P.H.D,
Have you ever heard about a P.H.D.?
P.H.D....
I mean, I've heard the letters separately.
It's the first time I've heard it together.
To be frank, it seems
the order of alphabets seems wrong.
Because after P, it's Q and R Chitti
Did your father go to
a Telugu medium school?
Chitti, do you know how grand
your wedding was supposed to be?
Police, Lawyers, Politicians....

I got really close to
the lawyer Padmanabham during this case.
So now, MLA Chanakya
and all those ministers,
will be at out wedding.
What the F-
Hell, and heaven
Did notice how well our English matched?
Same pinch.
Chitti, if you either talk to him or
his friends once again
Sir!
Say whatever you
want to about me,
but my friends are
diamonds, sir.
Mama, your mama's clothes are real nice.
Hey!
Those are my wedding night clothes.
Who are you guys?
Neighbours sir.
Neighbours?
Chitti, Please tell me you're not in love...
Aah... Aah....
Tell him, Tell him.
Ew, no.
Get out.
Sir, I've not come to attend your class,
I came for Chitti.
I will leave only if Chitti asks me to.
Chitti?
Get out, Srikanth.
Chitti, don't be afraid because
your dad is here.
Tell him what's in your heart.
Get out, Srikanth.
Get out, Srikanth.
From the heart, get out, don't come back.
Goodbye Zubaida
Immediately send this for dry cleaning.
Hey, remove your clothes.
Do you want me strip here sir?
No, not here, outside.
I cooked some rice, get the curries.
This is a reunion party.
2008 CHANCHALGUDA JAIL REUNION
I'm warning you right now.
I'll punch you if you mention
intermittent fasting, keto diet.
Drink like a maniac,
But you cannot puke anywhere.
Hello.
Anna, it's me Srikanth.
Chain-snatching, Srikanth?
No, murder Srikanth.
Then you have to mention it no?
This is about a theft.
Do you want me to do it?
No Anna, the theft has occurred.
Then, why did you call me?
Someone stole my car,
my closest friend Anna.
Definitely, someone from our.....
I'll call you back.
Hey Sharif,
-Anna
Anna
Your car was stolen by that MLA's fan
How are we back here again?
Hey, brother, what are they drinking?
How can we get the phone
from inside the car?
Hey, psst...Srikanth?
Hey what happened?
Who? Oh my!

Why did you come here?
Hi
Hi?
Namaste, Namaste.
Did you call her here?
Why did you call her?
Srikanth...
-Umm..
Srikanth...
-Hah...
Srikanth
Sorry Srikanth...
Actually I need to apologise to you.
No, I need to apologise.
No, I need to apologise first.
No, no. I insulted you the other day,
before my father.
Hey, but I insulted your father as well.
No, I have to apologise first no?
No, I have to say it first.
He has started it again
You're trying to dominate me here also?
Okay
If there's any conflict
between the two of us,
you apologise to me first.
Did you see that?
Thu.
That's how I keep her in my control.
Idiot.
Come here.
Okay, coming.
Mama, come here
- Tell me.
Listen to me carefully,
We need to enter with the 'pherfect' planning.
okay...
I've thought everything through.
I'll enter first.
Sekhar follows me.
And then you.
We should run inside without being spotted.
Don't use your original names inside.
If I call out for Pushkar,
you need to respond with Sangamesh
If anybody comes in the way,
Don't flee.
I'll give you a signal,
like this, 63 degrees.
but you guys don't respond
with the 72 degrees,
it will confuse me.
As soon as the phone
is in my hands,
I'll escape like
Jackie Chan in the car.
If anyone obstructs us,
We'll beat them to pulp,
Drink their blood.
and get out of there.
If any of you faces a problem.
You guys, make this sound.
Then I'll come there, making horse sounds
- You'd know it's me.
Stop it bro.
What an idea Mama,
My brain was fed on ladies finger
when I made this plan.
Chitti, don't get involved in
these dangerous lives.
Hey, where's Chitti?
Where did she go?
Look there.
Cheese.
Oh man.
What a woman, Mama
Hey, wait.
It's nice
Aah....
What are you doing?
Sending it to my father.
What does your father do?
He's an S.I, the police.
S.I?
Hmm...
I've even shared a live location
Why did you send him a live location?
Because I've shared everything
with my father since I was a kid.
Where do you have to go?
We'll drop you.
Take a right from the Jubilee Hills circle,
-Go drop madam.
You know that coffee shop no?
Okay madam, our boy will drop you.
There are two goons there.
Mama, we've arrived at
a life and death situation.
Even if one of us dies, as long
as the other two are happy.
Hey
Decide who that person is
amongst the two of you.
What the hell?
And what if something happens to us?
Even if anything happens to you,
nobody in your family is
going to feel bad about it.
You're that one amongst us.
What, the scape goat?
No, an inspiration.
Hey get out.
Hey!
Your name is the first
name I write with a pen.
Mama, when you didn't
talk to me for two days,
I cried for seven days.
Not those same old stories again.
Hey, let me go.
Let us follow you.
We'll follow as soon as you lead us out.
For once, you please go.
Please, you go.
Sorry, just a minute.
Hey, what Th-
Look there!
Die, die, die.
Oh! no.
Hey, come!
He is calling us, let's go.
How are you?
Open Sesame
Hey, look around.
What is this?
I'll hit it with this rock and it'll open.
Donâ€™t make any noise!
Sorry
Did it open?
Look for the phone.
At the bottom, to the left.
Look under the mat.
I am checking, don't make any noise.
Below the Tyre.
They are coming, quick.
MLA Chanakya,
-Zindabad, zindabad.
Hey, hide, they've come.
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.
Hey, this is the car they used
to carry our boss' body.
That's why I stole this car
taking a great risk.
Now tell me
what to do with this shitty car.
-We will burn it, bro.
-We will burn it.
If they burn the car,
the phone will be destroyed with it.
Oh, God.
Hey, stop it.
We won't find justice in the courts.
Those three are not punished.
We have to change the system.
-I'll change it, bro.
-I'll change it, bro.
You always get to do the job.
Let's give him a chance this time.
Thanks, bro.
We have to give a presentation
regarding tomorrow's location. Let's go.
Hey, Ravi is stuck in the vehicle.
What do they have planned?
Where are they taking him?
Mla Chanakya, Zindabad.
Sir what's your Spandana (response) regarding this?
I'm not in touch with
Spandana at all these days.
Sir, what do you want?
I want justice.
Three criminals have tried killing
my brother in this vehicle.
We haven't gotten any justice yet.
What are you planning to do now?
If I don't get a call from
the supreme court within two minutes.
I'll burn the car right here.
Not just the car, even the police,
Okay, maybe not.
Where are you guys?
-Right outside.
Don't worry.
Are you coming here or not?
Coming,
Please come quick....
They are all drinking around the vehicle.
We are don't have a chance.
Mama, don't worry,
give me five minutes, please.
I'll do something and get you out of there.
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.
We will not stop this here,
We'll do an on foot March
till we reach America!
Open the gate, chanakya is great
Open the gate, chanakya is great
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.
Where are you from?
I am the first person to
have erected a 60 ft. cut out
of Chanakya Anna in Hyderabad.
Super!
How dare they touch out Chanakya!
Chanakya is our God.
Anna, you need to definitely
get those three punished.
I'm not Chankaya's genuine fan, you are.
We'll punish them with your hands.
Open the gate, Chanakya is great
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.
Here, he needs to turn
two ashes in two minutes.
Light him up.
You want me to light him on fire?
You want me to light it?
Yes, you.
I'm burning my own...
Can we light them first?
They look dangerous.
He looks innocent.
Have you looked his eyes properly?
He's the bigger culprit.
Light him up.
I can recognise the kind of person he is,
just by his eyes.
You're right Anna.
Whoever dare touched MLA Chanakya,
should turn to ashes.
How dare you touch him?
I'll turn you into ash.
Hey man, look at all the problems
these two bring you.
My father always told me
that they were a bad influence.
Anna!
-You don't worry.
Anna, please not petrol,
The rates have really gone up.
Anna, please listen to me,
this is a diesel vehicle,
Petrol won't set it on fire.
Hey!
Your vengeance cannot be extinguished
by a small matchstick
Even if the matchbox is small,
the flame is big.
It will not suffice,
If we light a fire here,
it needs to reach Delhi.
-yes indeed
A volcano needs to surface.
-yes indeed
What do you say?
Sweetest of the sweets is 'Kova'
our annaâ€™s revenge is Lava
Wow, your slogans are amazing,
I don't know anything but
the spinach fry slogan
You can use the slogan Anna,
I have one for every vegetable.
But who's that man Anna?
- I'll definitely kill him.
My name is Chanakya Chandu...
Chanakya sir recently
won an election with one vote right?
That was mine.
Who's Chanakya's biggest fan?
You right?
Why is he being a hero in front of them?
Actually, I have been planning
this for 6-7 months
Hey, that kerosene.
Hey what are you saying Madhapur?
Tamarind Rasam, Chanakya Awesome.
My life is dedicated to Chanakya sir...
excuse me...
Who the hell are you?
Get out, Shekhar is waiting for you,
I'll get the phone.
Who gave you these sunglasses,
get out of here.
Door. Door. Where is it?
Brother, I got popular
in media because of you,
I want to transform
my revenge into lava.
What is that, Anna?
If you light a torch here, the flame should
be visible in Delhi.
Definitely Anna.
Trump should hear the sound!
Definitely will be heard....
It needs to blast!
Will blast, Anna
Then, you burn yourself....
Okay, I will burn...
-Bring him.
-What burn mys-
Anna, listen to me.
Anna, one minute
Just listen to me.
I think burning this car is enough
for your vengeance.
-It's not enough.
-Your vengeance does not have scope.
Shut up, will you light yourself or not?
I will light myself Anna
With the media as my witness,
Even if I have to sacrifice
my life for justice,
My burning soul...
mummy... mummy... Ooh... Ooh...
sir, this is not working, bro...
Okay. You go and torch him...
No... it's working... it's good...
quality carbon... matchstick... good...
If we wait for the national channels,
we'll have a wider reach.
We have Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok.
Why don't you start?
Let me speak a few words
before I die.
This is all...
I'm self-immolating because,
In our MLA Chanakya sirâ€™s case....
Justice has been served late,
Umm....
Late.... late... late...late...late.... Justice late...
friends ... friends come very late...
Friends should never be late
People are losing lives here.
And for that reason.
my life shouldnâ€™t go to waste,
friends shouldnâ€™t come late.
Oh! again coined one more slogan,
Okay. ready, bro
My life shouldnâ€™t go to waste,
friends shouldnâ€™t come late.
Hey Srikanth
Huh?
He is a great fan of me.
He's escaping!
Yes!
Get in quickly.
He will not say no to our word.
Letâ€™s move go, go.

Run away from the gun
Go find a place my son,

Silly fools,
Are trying to break the rules.
And fighting with these goons.
And mountain on their spoons.
Run run run,

Mama, according to my imagination
if we have to be safe
we have to go towards the north
Mama
Hey, wait a minute.
Please step aside, and let me go.
You are the girl on the phone, right?
Of course it's you! Same face
No, itâ€™s not me, you are mistaken
Weâ€™ve been looking for you
Whatâ€™s on this phone?
Chanakyaâ€™s men are after
our lives for this.
Please, listen to me,
Big shots are involved in this.
I even had to resign from my job
as a journalist.
There are a lot of problems.
What, you want me to listen to you?
I know you faced
some small problems because of me.
Small problems?
They are trying to kill us.
You donâ€™t know.
I go to Sai Baba
temple every week
and pray for your safety.
What?
Here, listen and try to understand
We are in deep mess.
Just tell me how to unlock this folder.
Please listen to me,
I donâ€™t know.

â€œHi, I am Preetam
The next episode on â€œNeralu Ghoraluâ€
â€œA son who brutally killed his mother.â€
Wait bhaiyya.
Sir,
He is a fan
Move, move.
Sir, you are...
I am Preetam, of â€œNeralu Ghoraluâ€
So, you were the one in that Jogipet episode?
Yes, that is how I shot to fame.
What even was that video?
How could you exaggerate it so much?
My life has been destroyed because of it.
Donâ€™t you ever show the truth?
Making such dumb and useless videos?
Yes, tell me
Yeah, I am coming
Next time if I see
such dumbass videos,
Iâ€™ll rip you.
Get lost!
Get lost!
Just wait, I will make a video
of this incident too.
You dumb cow!
Oh my,
It looks like they will not let us go.
They will kill us anyway, even if we
give them the phone or not.
Not really.
Chanakyaâ€™s life and death
secrets are in our hands,
weâ€™ll get out of this mess.
Mama, there is only one guy who can
help us out of this situation.
MLA Ramachandraiah
Why will he help us?
What is an enemy's enemy to us?
Eternal Enemy!
He'd be a friend, dimwit.
I am not saying that he will help
us out of love or respect.
But out of hatred for Chanakya
They hate each other.
Minus plus minus? Will be a plus for us.
I will hand this phone over to
Ramachandraiah
We are going to get out of this case.
I will make sure of it
That's my nature.
Thatâ€™s it.
Hey, wait.
Sir, we want to meet Jogipet MLA
Why?
To share our sorrows
What sorrows?
Because his grandmother
has not been receiving her pension,
His grandfather passed away.
It's a confusing situation sir,
Alright, go.
Thanks a lot, sir.
Sir, Jogipet MLA is not even in our party.
Hey, wait
Hey, educational ministry is downstairs,
let's get the books.
Letâ€™s go.
Mama, Ramachandraiah
Mama, last chance.
We are neck deep in trouble
I will count to three,
Letâ€™s run and break
through the door and
make this phone land
in Ramachandriahâ€™s hands.
Itâ€™s doesnâ€™t matter even if one of us dies
What say?
Swear on Jogipet,
On my count, 1, 2, 3...
Don't you have any trust?
Shameless cheaters.
What happened?
Why are you gawking like that?
Alright, letâ€™s all go together.
Just divert that bodyguard and
I will manage the rest.
Letâ€™s go.
Walk
Walk!
Donâ€™t get scared seeing that gun.
I am there for you.
Anna, is this Mr Ramachandraiahâ€™s office?
Who are they, sir?
From our party?
Hey,
who are you?
is that a gun in your Pocket?
What gun?
Are you here to murder Ramachandraiah?
Get them!
Security get them
Run! Run!
Stop them
Sir, gross injustice has been done to me.
You have to take some action.
Sir, Sir, I donâ€™t know anything.
But Chanakyaâ€™s men are after my life.
Sir, Iâ€™ll tell you the truth
Sir, I donâ€™t know what it is,
but there is a video on that phone.
You can check, sir
who are those two
I donâ€™t know anything, sir,
I am innocent sir. Kill them both sir.
Please check the phone, please, please.
Please.. please
please leave me
Its open now, check it
That Chanakya! and this video!
With this video, Chanakyaâ€™s life,
will it get squashed?
Our lives are in a mess, sir.
Your life is all set.
Be happy.
Thank you sir.
You helped not only me
but the entire nation.
Yes!
You are precious gems!
Thank you, sir, thank you...
You came right place at the right time.
Sir, you have power in your hands
We have brains.
If we join hands...
Does that mean I have no brains?
No, sir, I mean we have no power.
yes...
Then its..okay...
Then, it's fine.
Sir, the thing is...
It's okay. Tell me, what is it?
I have to pay my daughter's school fees.
Otherwise, they will not allow her
to attend the exams.
I have not received my salary
for three months.
Don't think of it as a salary.
-Please go, Mr. Chalapati Rao.
-Sir.
I'll arrange it.
Please call JP real estate.
Give that money to these workers.
Okay, sir.
Please forgive me, father.
Sensational news!
Mr Ramachandraiah,
who has never come before the media,
is here to talk to us about Mr. Chanakya
Today, I am holding this press meet to
talk about a few important issues.
Chanakya is dead now.
Everyone knows that I speak
the truth and nothing else.
Brother!
My brother!
Ramachandriah, Chanakya
are like brothers.
We do have differences.
That is true.
But thatâ€™s only when it comes
to serving society.
What on earth did he do!
Sir, you are known bitter rivals,
but why are you allies now?
Look
-I will answer it
Okay
We knew you'd ask us this question
when we become allies.
We had to become allies
some time or the other,
We became allies today
I love you brother
-I love you too.
What is this?
Not now, later, please.
What is this?
How are you allies with Ramachandriah?
Hey
Those three handed
my phone over to Ramachandraiah
Yeah, so?
To prevent the video coming put,
I had to give him 100 crores
out of the 500 I got.
I had to compromise.
So,We lost 100 crores?
For the video not to come out,
we have to lose 100 crores.
Otherwise, all my political career is over.
Okay, but tell me now.
What's on that phone?
Hello,
All good sir?
Hey, all this while I thought you
three were naive.
I felt guilty for getting you
stuck in middle of this
So you're not feeling guilty any more?
How dare you to give my phone
to Ramachandraiah?
No sir, it happened by mistake.
We were supposed to give it to you sir
I will show who is Chanakya
tomorrow in the court
Sir,Sir please, sir...sir
Tomorrow, your life is closed
The verdict for MLA Chanakya's murder attempt
is to be given today.
Let's watch the proceedings of the court.
Not her again.
Good Morning, your honor
So which movie did you watch this time?
Come to the point, your honor
These three innocent men,
Have been trapped in a big case,
Because they're from
a small town and
can't do anything.
But there's more to the truth.
If you permit, Iâ€™d like to ask Mr Chanakya,
a few questions.
Mr Chankaya, do you drink?
Itâ€™s okay, you can speak without hesitation.
Our judge drinks as well.
Alright, letâ€™s come to the point
You And Ramachandraiah together made a scam
that video was recorded on the phone
That phone has this secret recorded.
Isn't that why you created this drama
and hid the phone?
I did not hide it
You hid it
I did not hide it
You hid it
I did not hide it
You hid it I didn't
You didnâ€™t hide it
Yes, that is what I have been saying
Exactly, your honor
Usually, according to human psychology,
When I said â€œYou did not hideâ€
But he still said that he did not hide it.
So, you can imagine how strongly
he has made up his mind to lie.
Just think about it
Objection, your honor
Lawyer Shamili is playing games,
and confusing my client Chanakya
Itâ€™s not correct
She is exploiting my client's innocence
Your honor,
Lawyer Shamili is repeatedly
affirming that these three are innocent.
If you permit, Iâ€™d like to present
a video to you
â€œHey, whatâ€™s this?
What are you serving to the public?
I will kill you.
Do you see how violent their behaviour is,
your Honor?
Therefore, I request the court to find them
guilty of the crime.
Is there anything you want to say
for the last time?
Hey,
Only you eat ladies finger in our group and
your imagination is excellent.
Go and speak...go...
Will you say something or
simply talk amongst yourselves?
Hey, what can I speak?
Your honor...
Namaste, sir
Can you replay the CCTV footage
shown by the lawyer?
Pause there, sir.
Can you see Chanakya, his brother
and a third person there?
He is a Hong Kong businessman, sir
How can you certify that
he is from Hong Kong?
Sir, I watch Jackie Chan movies,
without subtitles.
If they are from China,
I can easily confirm
He is from Hong Kong
Just a minute, sir,
Donâ€™t get involved.
Correct
That night, Chanakya, his brother
and the Hong Kong businessman were,
discussing something seriously about hotels
and entered a room.
It was a birthday so,
Why would they be serious?
They entered the room laughing,
As soon as they entered,
first the brother sat,
wait, why would the brother
sit before Chanakya did,
Chanakya sat and then the brother.
After that, they were
in a serious discussion.
Hotels, shares, profit, loss and
many other secrets.
Suddenly the Hong Kong businessman
got furious and started talking in Chinese
Speaks Gibberish
What a big statement he made.
We donâ€™t understand Chinese
Translate it in Telugu for us.
Sorry, sir
He said strongly,â€
This is when Chanakyaâ€™s brother got some
'suspentation'
Brother, what about my share of profits?
Chanakya and the Hong Kong businessman
together made him a scapegoat.
I said, â€œYou take 50% share, I take 50% share
and you will take the remaining 0%â€
Chanakya's brother
got angry,
took a gun out of his pocket
and fired some shots.
That is when a girl arrived at the party.
She must've recorded the whole thing
on her phone.
Correct! From then on, they went after
the girl and the phone.
This is too much.
Their imagination and storytelling
is beyond this world.
All these imaginations and ladies fingers
wonâ€™t work here in the court.
Tell me if you have strong evidence.
Evidences,
This reminds me of a poem from
Mahabharata that I learnt.
'Karmanye vaadika rasyam'
Chankyam- innocent-um accused-um!
Huh!
What is happening here?
Your honor, I donâ€™t understand
what he's saying
I donâ€™t understand either.
I can't even understand
why we came to Hyderabad in the first place
She doesnâ€™t know
why she became a lawyer.
You donâ€™t know why you became a judge-
Sir, I know itâ€™s personal.
I mean a lot of things happen without a plan.
I want to ask the court, sir
Where are we headed?
Hello, blue shirt, yes you.
Hello, look my eye to eye
I am asking you,
where are we are headed?
We live in a world where everyone has
passwords for WiFi.
If anyone wants to use WiFi outside
anyone's house, we need passwords
How can a society which doesnâ€™t share
passwords understand our problems?
I get goose pimples when I think
of the problems in our society.
When I think of goose pimples,
I get more goose pimples.
Corruption, pollution,
population, picturization,
global warmation, is everywhere.
Do even know what global warmation is?
Mr.Defense lawyer, Mr Somashekar,
My name is not Somashekar.
Did you hear that Mr. Dwarakaprasad?
Dwarakaparasad, who's he?
Just tell me one thing sir
Donâ€™t you know all this drama is staged
by Hong Kong businessman and Chanakya?
Yes, I know...err...I donâ€™t know.
I am Jogipet, B.Tech topper, sir
41%, in the second attempt.
If this is the situation of
a B.Tech pass out...
Imagine the situation of these two 10th failures?
Hey, Ravi and Shekar donâ€™t be ashamed,
look at me.
Hello, media, cover them and
show them to the public
Your honor, in Jogipet, Sangareddy, the whole world,
Do you know how many
young people are unemployed
Tell me...
Thatâ€™s not my job
At times, I wonder why I was born?
We came here because we were
never respected in Jogipet.
And people fly off to America because
they are not well respected here.
Next, will they go to the moon?
If this goes on, where is
Final Destination, Part 3, sir?
Isnâ€™t it why you are not doing
the investigation well?
Because we are from Jogipet and
they are from Hong Kong.
Isn't that it sir?
We are 'not have people'
they are 'have people'.
Canâ€™t the 'haves' and 'not haves'
survive in one place?
But you are together.
True, but we are 'not haves'
'Haves and 'not haves'
are all one in the court.
Why not sir?
In this court, as you can see there
are only 'haves'
What about the 'not haves'
But you have no?
See sir, no value for people like us.
This is ridiculous!
Are you saying, yes or no?
Yes, I am saying No
How can you say no?
No, I am saying yes.
How can you say yes?
Why not? Basically, maybe, generally,
yours sincerely
Your honor, he is wasting
the courtâ€™s prime time.
I am also aware of Prime,
and Netflix
and not even downloaded one
movie of Jackie Chan, sir
Hong Kong connection of
Chanakya to be investigated
by the Indian Constitution Sir,
Even after all this, if
you fail to understand,
just get the hell
and heaven, sir.
Hell and heaven
Hey, sit down
Mr.Subramanyam, who was that
Hong Kong delegate?
Chanakya, come here
Who was that Hong Kong guy?
Hong Kong my foot.
He makes noodles,
Him and his dumb imagination.
Please tell me the truth
Never hide anything from
a doctor and a lawyer.
It is Noodles.
Noodles, your honor...
Noodles?
-Hong Kong noodles
He is a chef who makes noodles.
Sir, we had a fight that he didnâ€™t
put enough sauce in the noodles.
Where is the sauce?
Whom are you pointing
your finger at shithead?
Sir, is this even Balwant Choudhary's court?
What do they think of you, sir?
Stop it.
He didnâ€™t say that.
But I can feel it.
You might not feel it, because
of your modesty.
Court is ordering the police
Department to investigate the
relation between Chanakya
and the Hongkong businessman.
The high command is to form a new
committee named Operation Noodles.
#ByeBye to Swiss, #HiHi to Hong Kong
While youth in our country
is unemployed and dejected;
The ruling party is busy investing
in Hong Kong.
All youth in country are showing
their resentment against the scam
How can you simply hide a big scam
under the guise of 'noodles', sir?
Trust me, it was about the noodles.
After all that happened,
you still say noodles?
Yes.
You can at leas lie prop-
It's the truth sir!
What?
Why are you going to Hong Kong, sir?
I am going to Vizag.
To attend my granddaughter's wedding.
So, how will go to Hong Kong
from Vizag, sir?
Sir...sir...sir
In the past, it was the British,
and now itâ€™s the Chinese.
The government is behind the scam.
Hey, don't hit him.
What's actually in the phone?
Excuse me, journalist lady.
Give me your phone for a minute.
Why sir?
I want to call my mother
But I have to go urgently.
Iâ€™ll give it back
Sir, there is nothing on my phone.
Then give me your phone.
Give the Phone
You think you can blackmail me
with that video?
Go.
Get out.
Hey
Give me my phone back
- You'll fire it.
Just leave it
Give me my phone.
The Jana Balam party
leader is enjoying himself
while eating Hong Kong noodles.
Iâ€™ve seen many kinds of people in
my 40 years of a political career.
But who's this guys?
This one video is enough to crash
our party and for by-elections to follow.
What is this â€˜Hong Kong dramaâ€™?
Trust me, sir
I swear, that guy just makes noodles.
Those Hong Kong guys have landed
in Hyderabad.
Iâ€™ve booked AC hotel rooms for them.
-Hong Kong?
What about it?
Itâ€™s a contract of AC and electronics.
Itâ€™s a good fat deal.
We can use that money as
a party fund so I agreed to it.
Chanakya, what are you talking about?
If this spreads to the media,
our party will fall apart
Take the case back immediately and close it.
Sorry, sir, I wonâ€™t leave them.
Well then, you can leave this party.
What?
Yes!
The special dish on our
cooking show today is,
Hong Kong noodles.
Rascal
Not another word about â€œHong Kongâ€
After examining MLA,
Mr Chanakyaâ€™s case,
it is found that Chankay's fan
guilty of the murder.
He has been sentenced to six months
of imprisonment.
Srikanth, Ravi and Shekar are proved not
guilty of the crime and thus released.
This is my final verdict.
But I still suspect them.
Chitti...Sri...
So, should I book the function hall?
Chitti, you fought his case,
itâ€™s over now.
You have nothing more to do
with this guy, letâ€™s go.
Dad, I have something to say
I fell for Srikanthâ€™s innocence.
Decide whether you want him or me?
Dad...
Donâ€™t tell me that you want both of us.
No, dad...
I want Srikanth!
I'm also a decent Citizen Kane like you uncle.
See, look into my eyes.
Is there any kind of trait that
I share with those criminals?
Guess, who it is?
IAS officer, Mr Murthy
-Hello, Suvarna.-Ravi.
You want to meet me, right?
I'm ready now.
What do you mean?
I'm meeting my fiancÃ©.
My wedding is on the 10th of next month.
-Is this a joke?-No at all.
Please come without fail.
They will serve foreign brand alcohol.
-Give me a Poori.
-Crap!
Why are you afraid?
Chitti's dad.
Hey! Uncle.
Ew, no.
Get away.
Why do you look so young?
Is it a child marriage?
It's a joke uncle.
Your Chitti and our Srikanth, we're one big family.
Please don't count us as one
Take him away.
I'll take care of the wedding.
I'm inviting a tleast a
100 prisoners as guests.
We are one, all are one.
Don't let him out till we get married.
Sir, I don't know anything.
Chitti get in,
Sir please sir.
I'll kill myself.
Kill yourself.
Fine take her, but over my dead body.
I don't care if I die also.
Run over me, come.
Hey, not reverse, come ahead.
Is it nice?
Daddy, Where are those facebok
120 likes bangle?
Those shiny ones.
What happened?
why are you looking at me like that?
What is that?
Arey, what is this?
Srikanth Ladies Emporium!
Thanks.
-How is it?
-Super.
Akka, this is brand new. Have a look
Why are you so dull?
I canâ€™t work as a mechanic anymore.
Everyone is making fun of me.
I will go to Hyderabad...
Look, I was just like you.
Why do you want to
go elsewhere because
a random person is
not respecting you?
Tell me something?
Does anyone else in Jogipet knows
how well to repair a bike?
you will find 'shelf' respect
if you do your own work
Thatâ€™s it.
In the property will,
they got silver glasses
while we got copper pots.
Pots are bigger than the glasses.
You're the one benefiting
Can you show me where
the jewellery box is?
Iâ€™ll just come.
I am not able to find it.
Hey, Lawyer Chitti. When will you take up my case?
You need to fight hard for it
Hey, Srikanth...
Mom, I was looking for the jewellery box
Your friends have come.
The contract for the first Indo Asian games
A lot of people suggested
we hand the contract over to
China, or Korea,
I rejected their advice,
fought with them and,
Swatantra Electronics
It's such an established company.
Itâ€™s not easy to get a job in such
a big company.
What did you guys do by going
to Hyderabad?
None of you got a job.
But we got realizations, uncle.
Go to Dubai, you will get more, â€œrealizationsâ€
Come, letâ€™s plan the wedding.
You can't do one thing right.
When will they get realisations?
What all we planned to do,
and all what happened
I wonder what was on that phone.
Our lives have changed.
Mama, give me your phone.
Why?
Weâ€™ll call Ramachandriah and
find out about the video.
Idiot!
This is all because of you.
If you think I'm the one
causing the problem,
I'll leave from here.
Sir, I am very nervous.
Interviewing you is a
big deal for me because
among all the politicians now,
you are very intelligent.
Can I ask you anything?
Sure!
Are you a bowler or batsman in Cricket?
I'm a goalkeeper in cricket.
Heh?
Huh.
