"The skull was placed on a plate
and given to a girl,"
"who then presented it to her mother."
Void of expression,
the executioner stood there
with a bloodstained
long sword in his hand.
She is a real woman.
She has a burning passion
within her cold exterior.
That is her personality.
"A Rebours", by Huysmans
Strange Circus
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the circus.
We have a great show for you today.
It's going to be a lot of fun.
Please enjoy.
My name is Black Shadow,
and I'll be your host.
I'm also known as Sad Song.
I'll try to be a good host,
so please stay until the end.
Now, let's get this started.
Do you want to die?
Or do you want to live?
Well, let's all have fun
and feel alive.
C'mon. Rock'n 'roll.
Now, here's our first act of the day.
Is there anyone in the audience
who would like to be guillotined?
Is there anyone?
You?
You?
You there.
Afraid to die?
I was sentenced to death at birth.
Or maybe my mother was to be
executed, and we switched places.
As far back as I can remember...
I've been surrounded by guillotines.
What's wrong?
One wrong move, and I'm gone.
Everyone, please be careful.
If you're not, it'll be dangerous.
No playing with fire, OK?
If you speak, you may accidentally
blow out the flame.
You have to be quiet, OK?
Now, ignite.
Mitsuko Ozawa in grade 6.
Report to the principal's office.
Mitsuko?
Mitsuko.
Yes.
Come in.
Come here.
Closer.
Closer.
Tell me.
What's the matter?
Why did your grades drop?
I'm sorry.
Don't embarrass me.
Sorry.
Mom is worried.
Who am l?
Who?
Dad.
Repeat.
Dad.
Am I a man?
Or a woman?
-Man.
-Correct.
-Who are you...?
-I'm Mitsuko...
And?
I'm a man.
Tell me what you are, Mitsuko.
Are you a boy or a girl?
Girl.
Correct.
You're doing fine.
Sit.
This is accordion music
recorded in 1938.
It's interesting.
Look.
When Dad first molested me,
it was the beginning of the end.
I was 12.
Mom and I looked exactly alike.
I was her, and she was me.
Mom used to be nice.
You look just like me.
One day, you'll look great in this
'cause you're my daughter.
You're so pretty.
I'll give you all my clothes
when you're tall enough for them.
They'll all be yours.
So pretty.
Come here, Mitsuko.
This is a cello case
that I modified a little bit, you see?
Let's do something fun.
You get in the case
and look through this hole here.
Come on. Get in.
Now.
Good girl.
What is that?
That's nothing.
Bothers me.
That's nothing.
When Mom and Dad had sex,
they made me watch.
Felt like I was having sex.
Whenever I closed my eyes,
I would hear a squeaking sound.
That noise.
Good morning, students.
How are you all doing today?
It's such a beautiful day.
Sunshine, a lot of sunshine.
And that is what we need.
Sunshine in our hearts.
That's what's important.
That's how we must live.
Dad often talked about
what was good for us.
So, I figured whatever he did
was good for me.
I'm home.
Mitsuko?
Honey?
Mitsuko?
Honey?
Mitsuko?
Honey? Mitsuko?
That noise.
Again.
Dad touched both Mom and me.
The difference between us was
that she seemed happy.
But her joy was infectious.
It was dangerous.
Sayuri.
She's been watching us.
Bad girl.
Look what you did to her, Mitsuko.
Now, it's your turn.
You get in the case this time, Sayuri.
I lied down and became Mom.
When Dad touched me,
Mom watched.
I was convinced that I was Mom
and Mom was me.
Dad touched me, and I became Mom.
And I even began to enjoy sex.
'Cause I was Mom.
Look.
They look good on you.
Go ask Mom what she thinks.
Go.
I was sentenced to death at birth.
Or maybe my mother was to be
executed, and we switched places.
As far back as I can remember...
I've been surrounded by guillotines.
One wrong move, and I'm gone.
Those are...
My earrings.
What do you think you're doing?
Take them off.
What's wrong with you?
Stop.
Honey.
Put the knife down, you crazy bitch.
Bitch.
Heard it again.
Mom.
You thief.
When Dad was away,
Mom became abusive.
Get back here.
Come with me.
Get up.
Who gave you this hickey?
Answer me.
Whenever we were alone,
she would try to kill me.
She was jealous of me.
Mom.
That day...
Mitsuko.
I would rather forget.
You took one of my earrings,
didn't you?
Wait.
I didn't .
You took it.
I know you did.
Wait.
Come here.
My goddamn earring.
Where the hell is it, you thief?
Find it.
If you find my earring,
please let me know, OK?
I will. I promise.
Thanks.
Sorry.
When Mom died, she resembled me.
Me at age 12.
That day,
I turned into Mom at age 35.
Lying in her coffin, she was me.
She looked so serene.
Just like an innocent child.
I killed her.
Just you and me now.
Help...
Mitsuko.
Call me Sayuri.
Always been just us.
What, Mitsuko?
Honey, I am Sayuri.
Mitsuko.
When the hearse left,
I was no longer a child.
I carried my satchel and went
to school. I was 35 years old.
I was my mother.
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you...
Does anyone know what this means?
-Yes
-Mitsuko?
Love lasts forever.
What's over there, Mom?
The guillotine... where we die.
Mitsuko.
You're alive.
Your dad's here.
Could you give us a moment alone?
Of course.
Did you tell anyone, Mitsuko?
You know, about what happened.
It's our secret, OK?
I found out the hard way.
You love and care for your children,
but it's never enough.
ln order to truly understand them,
you must communicate with them.
You must love and care for them,
and also build relationships.
That's what's important.
That's what we must do.
Come on out.
Mirror, mirror on the wall...
Who's the fairest of them all?
Mom.
When the hearse left...
I was no longer a child...
I carried my satchel...
And went to school...
I was 35 years old...
Need a lunch break?
Hold it.
I need to use the bathroom.
There.
Stay inside.
Sorry.
This opening paragraph is
really gripping.
I love this.
"I was sentenced to death at birth."
"Or maybe my mother was to be
executed, and we switched places."
Brilliant.
Shut up.
Read it.
Is he new?
No, but he just requested
to be assigned to you.
Is that right? Read it.
Go ahead.
Yes. With pleasure.
You don't like it?
All your novels are brilliant.
Distracted?
I'm fine.
You have wanted to work with me?
I'm your fan.
Please keep reading.
Yes.
Taeko?
Yes.
Can I ask you something?
Just a sec.
Let me...
Don't .
Yes.
I wonder why she likes you.
Good luck with... you know.
What?
Well...
You know.
I don't .
Is this why she likes him?
I guess that's it.
'Cause you seem asexual.
You want to fuck her or what?
It's not like that.
It doesn't matter
as long as she writes good stuff.
By the way, I fucked that freak.
These guys did too.
We all fucked her.
But we're done.
She devoured us
and then vomited us.
We're her vomit now.
But you're still fresh meat.
Be careful, fresh meat.
You know, her wheelchair squeaks
when you fuck her.
It's so erotic.
But no one knows who she really is.
Maybe you can find out
what she's all about.
Like, why she always
writes about "Mitsuko."
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.
You can go now.
Let's go.
The rookie stays.
See you later, Yuji.
Taeko?
I have a question.
Shoot.
Is this book autobiographical?
No way.
I'm in a wheelchair,
but my father never molested me.
I'm done writing for the day.
I want to go out for a walk.
Walk?
Yeah.
OK.
You know, you sound like a robot.
Can I call you "Robo"?
OK.
That's so lovely.
Yeah.
I wanna walk.
Meaning?
Take a train.
I envy them.
-Let me help.
-No, that's fine.
Sure?
Thanks, Robo.
See that case?
I wrote about that.
Right.
ln school, I was in the orchestra.
Yeah?
I was a xylophonist.
Always on my feet.
I see.
Should've played the cello.
I guess.
Pretty windy today.
It's no big deal, Robo.
Aren't you cold?
Even if I were, I wouldn't admit it.
Right here.
Here?
I want to be alone.
The deadline is next week?
Please finish it.
By the way,
this is the music I wrote about.
Accordion music recorded in 1938.
Listen to it.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Bye.
I'm home.
What do you want to eat?
Hungry?
You know, I think I'll go
pick something up.
-This author is crazy.
-Especially her latest.
Taeko Mitsuzawa lets you
live Mitsuko's life.
Ever wonder why there's
never a picture of her?
She's probably ashamed.
You can only write this anonymously.
You think?
I hear she's handicapped and
that's why she writes this sex stuff.
You think she's sexually frustrated?
Don't underestimate her.
