- Good evening, Soames.
- Good evening, Mr. Conderley.
Well, I'm afraid I'm a little early, aren't I?
Miss Trellis wasn't
expecting anyone until 8:00.
I thought I'd come a little ahead of time.
Have a chat with Miss Fanny.
Sorry, sir, she's still dressing.
All right, I'll wait.
- May I bring you a drink?
- No, thank you.
- I never did care for drinking alone.
- You won't be drinking alone, sir.
I won't?
No, sir. Mr. Morrison also came
a little early.
He too hoped to have a little chat
with Miss Fanny. He's in the library...
... drinking sherry.
Hello, Edward.
Hello, Jim.
How come you're here so early?
My watch is fast.
- How is it you're here even earlier?
- I have no watch.
Don't believe in them.
I believe in another sherry
though, Soames.
- Lf he's having sherry, I'll have Scotch.
- Very good, sir.
Well, Jim, think there will be a war?
War? Between whom?
Between whom?
Haven't you been reading the papers?
Of course. I never seem to get around
to the front pages, though.
The kaiser sent an ultimatum to France,
France sent one to the kaiser...
... and the tsar's sent notes to everybody.
- Oh, those chaps.
No, I don't think there will be a war.
Not just yet anyhow.
Too hot.
Tell me. What do you people talk about
down in your section of Maryland?
Horses. And hounds.
You must think.
What do you think about?
What we talk about.
Horses and hounds.
Of course, I do a lot
of thinking about Fanny.
Tell me, is that all you people talk about?
Horses and hounds.
Oh, no. No.
We do quite a bit of sailing too.
Really?
You must lead a busy life.
I should say.
Stables and all,
doesn't give you a minute.
Besides which, I'm thinking
of running for Congress in the fall.
You are?
You should have an easy time
with all those horses squarely behind you.
Well, thought it would be rather nice
for Fanny. Wife of a statesman.
Would it be too difficult to grasp
that others have proposed to her too?
Oh, I grasp it.
But she can't marry all of us, you know.
Well, when you're elected to Congress,
perhaps you can arrange that.
Who the devil is that?
- Good evening, Soames.
- Good evening, Mr. Thatcher.
- Is Miss Fanny down yet?
- She's upstairs dressing.
I thought if I came before the rest...
... there might be an opportunity
for a chat.
I understand, sir. But you see...
What are you doing here, Thatcher?
I feel I have a right
to propose to Fanny now.
Father's promised
to increase my allowance.
He has? Doesn't he want
to marry her himself?
We didn't discuss it.
Well, Jim, what do you think?
War or no war?
What war is that?
Oh, sorry.
Thinking about Fanny.
- Hello.
- Glad to see you.
- Is Fanny in?
- She's upstairs dressing.
- Don't announce me. I'll go up.
- When did you get in to town?
- Just off the train. How is everyone?
- Everyone's fine.
- We're giving a dinner party tonight.
- Good.
- Going to be with us long?
- I hope so.
- Be sure to save me a place for dinner.
- Yes, sir.
I don't recognize him.
Either of you know him?
Fanny will have to stop meeting people.
Looks like he's never been
on a horse in his life.
Without even knocking.
Fanny.
- Hello, Fanny.
- Who is it?
- George.
- George? Which George?
Which... ? How many Georges
are there in your life?
Oh, three or four.
Well, this George is going straight
back to California.
Cousin George.
- George.
- Fanny.
- George, darling.
- Fanny.
- It's good to see you again.
- George, I love you very much...
... but would you moving your chin
to the right?
Manby spent an hour on these curls.
- Is that all you do with your time?
- Don't you think it was worth it?
Well, yes. Even after two years,
you look rather nice.
"Rather nice"?
That's all you ever say to me, Georgie.
I have my standards.
No woman is beautiful until she's
on the cover of the {y:i}Police Gazette.
You never were one to spoil me.
You forget that we were brought up together.
We had the measles and mumps together.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
After all, I saw you
with your didies up, down...
- George, really.
- I'm sorry.
- I can't think of you as beautiful.
- Will you fix these curls?
By the way, I saw three strange faces
on the way up. Who were they? Suitors?
- An entirely new batch.
- What happened to the old ones?
Some married, some committed suicide
and some grew fat.
She still has every man in New York
at her feet, Mr. Trellis.
It's getting now so that they are
proposing in bunches.
Hello, Trippy, darling.
Look who's here, George.
- George, I thought I heard your voice.
- Hello, Trippy.
Well, well. Welcome back.
How have you been?
- Fine. How have you been?
- Me? Wonderful. Couldn't be better.
Trippy has a job now and is working hard.
I certainly am, only I don't like
to hear it referred to as a job.
- What do you do?
- Customer's man.
Skeffington and Company.
- Skeffington and Company? The Jewish firm?
- Yes.
- How do you like working for him?
- Oh, he's all right. Just like any other boss.
Well, he must pay awfully well.
Here you are, giving lavish dinner parties.
Two years ago you were practically broke.
Oh, but we're still broke.
We've kept it from everybody
but the butcher, the baker...
... and several department stores.
The fact is, George, I kept my eyes
and ears open down at the office...
... and I made a little killing.
I thought if I bought new dresses
and gave a dinner party...
... it might encourage Trippy
to make more killings.
Very touching.
You don't have to worry about me.
My killer's instinct is aroused.
That's wonderful. I hope it's all true.
- Why do you say that?
- You still don't look anyone...
... straight in the eye
when you speak to them.
What gives you the right
to keep picking on me?
- Find me someone worth looking in the eye.
- That's not very flattering.
All right, Trippy, darling.
We'll find someone.
Now, come on and finish dressing.
And hurry. You know you're always late.
- Evening, Mr. Middleton, Mrs. Middleton.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Soames.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
I did want to see Mr. Trellis.
- I had no idea...
- Yes?
Nevertheless, I wonder if I could see him.
- Have you an appointment?
- I'm afraid not.
- Well, then, l...
- It's very important.
- Who shall I tell him is calling?
- Mr. Skeffington. Mr. Job Skeffington.
Oh, Mr. Skeffington.
I'll tell him immediately, sir.
Would you mind waiting
in the study? This way.
Thank you.
Trippy, George was just telling me that
they have a huge glass of orange juice...
... every morning in California.
Imagine.
Come in.
I beg your pardon, Miss Trellis...
... but Mr. Skeffington is here
to see Mr. Trellis.
- Who?
- Mr. Skeffington, Soames?
Yes, miss.
Darling, did you invite him?
Why didn't you tell me?
I certainly did not invite him.
He said he won't keep you a moment,
but it's very important.
Well, tell him I'm sorry,
but I can't see him tonight.
And I'll be happy to see him
in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Miss Trellis, your guests
are beginning to arrive.
Thank you.
Soames.
Ask Mr. Skeffington
if he'd wait a moment.
Yes, sir.
What was the idea of that?
Lt'd be nice if you saw your employer.
You'll get more work out of him.
If he thinks because I work for him
he can come barging in here...
But, darling, obviously
he didn't come for a free dinner.
- It must be important.
- Not so important it can't wait till morning.
You get rid of him. I won't see him.
Georgie, what do you think of that?
I think you and I had better
speak to Skeffington.
- But what will we tell him about Trippy?
- Oh, I'll try and think of some lie or other.
No, never mind. I'll think of one.
Trippy's kept me in practice.
Georgie, don't look so worried.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Fanny, you look beautiful.
You look more like
a statesman every day.
Really, Fanny?
My cousin George just arrived,
and for some reason or other...
... we must be kind to him.
George, this is Mr. Morrison,
Mr. Thatcher and Mr. Conderley.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Thank you.
Would you please excuse us?
Will you go speak to Skeffington? I'll be
right in. I must apologize to my guests.
Fanny.
Hello, Chester, darling.
- Fanny.
- Chester.
Evening, Dr. Parker.
Forgive me for being so late.
Fanny.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Mr. Skeffington?
I'm George Trellis, Trippy's cousin.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- I didn't know you were having a party.
- Quite all right. It must be very important.
I'm afraid it's extremely important.
Yes.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
Good evening, Mr. Skeffington.
Miss Trellis, Trippy's sister.
How do you do, Mr. Skeffington?
How do you do?
George, did you explain to
Mr. Skeffington about Trippy?
No, I didn't.
Unfortunately, my brother went to bed
half an hour ago, with a severe...
... cold.
- Headache.
Both?
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's possible the cold
brought on the headache.
Trippy feels sure he can shake
the cold off overnight...
... and be at his desk in the morning.
- I'm sure he will be.
I don't think that's quite probable.
You see, your brother
is no longer in my employ.
Trippy never said a word about that.
A man with a cold
is never very communicative.
- Lf you'll excuse me, perhaps I'd better...
- Mr. Skeffington.
Isn't there anything
you would care to discuss with us?
As you may know, Miss Trellis
and Trippy have no father or mother.
I'm more or less head of the family.
Since your cousin avoided me tonight and
undoubtedly will avoid me in the morning...
... I think perhaps
I had better speak to you.
Miss Trellis, it's rather a delicate matter,
so if you'll excuse us.
- No, Mr. Skeffington, I'm staying.
- All right, then.
I dropped in tonight on an impulse. I was
really on my way to see Arnold Hanlon.
Arnold Hanlon?
Wasn't he the district attorney?
He still is.
I don't think I'm going to be able
to take this standing up.
Maybe we'd all better sit down.
- Won't you, Mr. Skeffington?
- Thank you.
Has Trippy done something awful?
Well, to begin with, your brother
has many good qualities.
He's intelligent. He has imagination...
Oh, this is gonna be even worse
than I thought.
As a bond salesman,
he started out brilliantly.
His orders piled in,
his commissions mounted.
We gave him a larger desk,
put his name on the door.
That he told me about.
Then one day he handed in
a very large order...
... from a Mr. Clarence Pruitt
of Big Falls, Rhode Island.
So large an order, it required
an immediate confirmation.
It turned out there was no
Mr. Clarence Pruitt of Rhode Island.
It even turned out there was no such town
as Big Falls in Rhode Island.
You mean he made them both up?
He created everything but Rhode Island.
Naturally, we started to investigate
other orders that hadn't been confirmed.
We found he'd sold $50,000
worth of railroad bonds...
... to a man whose address placed him
squarely in the middle of the Hudson River.
Another block was sold to a man who
could have had only the mildest interest...
... in stocks and bonds,
having been dead for 23 years.
Good heavens.
How long was he doing this?
For about three weeks.
Weren't you suspicious at all?
He threw in enough cancellations
to make the thing seem authentic.
And here and there,
there was a legitimate sale.
But you had to look for them.
It wasn't very clever of him, was it?
Well, he showed a certain flare
for picking odd names and places...
... but it was hardly worth the $24,000
we paid him in commissions.
You mean he stole $24,000 from you?
Yes. I'm afraid that's it.
Does Trippy know you know?
Oh, yes. We called him in
and told him we'd give him...
... every opportunity to return the money.
Then we sent him to a smaller office...
... and took his name off the door.
That was two weeks ago.
- Has he made any effort to make good?
- Not only hasn't he returned a penny...
... but three days ago he forgot himself
and handed in another order...
... from Mr. Clarence Pruitt.
When a man becomes repetitious,
it's time to go to the DA.
You should have gone long ago.
Well, I was quite touched
when I discovered...
... that he'd lost most of the money
at the racetrack.
- That touched you?
- Yes.
They were my horses he bet on,
and I gave him the tips.
How was I to know
it was my own money?
Poor Trippy.
I'm sorry, Miss Trellis.
I know it won't be any hardship...
... for you to return the money.
- No hardship?
There won't be unpleasantness.
Mr. Skeffington, you may as well know
that Miss Trellis and Trippy are stone broke.
I don't understand.
- The Trellis wealth was a legend.
- Well, it's now a myth.
When my father died four years ago
he did leave a considerable estate...
... but, you see,
Trippy insisted on managing it.
He went through their fortune
and was starting in on yours.
I see.
But the house, servants.
I was under the impression...
Everybody's under the same impression.
Even the creditors.
I take it, then, there's no chance
of the money being returned, is there?
I'll be leaving now.
Unless, of course, Trippy could get another
job and pay you back a little each week.
You couldn't write him
a reference, could you?
I could, but my heart
wouldn't be in it, really.
Well...
... all we can do is throw ourselves
on your mercy.
You see, there are stockholders.
It's not my money, it's the corporation's.
Yes, but the horses were yours
and not the corporation's, weren't they?
Yes, that's true.
But I'm not quite sure of the logic.
If you give us time,
I'll look over the estate again.
Perhaps there's something I can salvage.
Mr. Skeffington.
Well, the stockholders don't know yet.
I'll let it ride a while.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Mr. Skeffington, may I tell you how...
- Please. I'm keeping you from your guests.
Wouldn't you stay for dinner?
After all, you're really the host.
- It's your money.
- No, thank you.
I'm dining with the district attorney.
Just a social call.
I'm sorry you can't stay.
- Good night, Mr. Skeffington.
- Good night, Miss Trellis.
Don't bother seeing me to the door.
You have your guests.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Good night, Mr. Skeffington.
Good night.
- I could wring Trippy's neck.
- It wouldn't do any good, Georgie.
When he was a boy,
we'd put him to bed regularly...
... without supper, and he'd still gain weight.
- But what are we gonna do?
- There's nothing to worry about.
- No?
No. There will be three dozen roses
in the morning.
What a beautiful basket
of flowers, Manby.
- Whose were the first to arrive?
- Mr. Morrison's.
Which are Mr. Skeffington's?
No flowers came from Mr. Skeffington.
These are Mr. Thatcher's,
and these are Mr. Conderley's.
Manby, were there any calls
for me this morning?
I mean, calls other than Mr. Morrison's
and Mr. Thatcher's and Mr. Conderley's?
The Reverend Dr. Parker called.
He said to tell you dinner
last night was heavenly.
- Did he ask if I'd sold any bazaar tickets?
- Yes.
I thought so.
Well, I haven't, Manby. Not a one.
You may take them back downstairs.
- Good morning, Fanny.
- Good morning, Trippy.
- What day is today?
- Friday.
Oh, I miscalculated.
I didn't intend getting up until Monday.
Hey, I can't find my pulse.
That doesn't surprise me in the least.
You knew George wanted to talk to you
last night about Mr. Skeffington.
That's why you drank so much.
Since when have I needed an excuse?
Trippy, what are you going to do now?
How can we possibly
repay Mr. Skeffington?
What do you mean, "repay Skeffington"?
We don't owe him anything.
The whole thing's probably
a huge clerical error.
Twenty-four thousand dollars?
A clerical error?
Well, money and high finance
confuse me.
I never know what belongs to whom
or whose is what.
People are very picayune about money.
Oh, leave me alone, I have a hangover.
Trippy.
Why did you do it?
I'm the brother of the most sought-after girl
in New York. I've gotta live up to it.
That's no excuse
for doing something so dreadful.
- Did Skeffington say what he's gonna do?
- He said that he'd let it ride a while.
Very magnanimous of him.
Listen, Fanny...
... I don't want you to ask any favors of him.
We don't have to beg from him.
- I don't like him or his type.
- I think he was very considerate of you.
The least you can do is forgive him
for having robbed him.
Rob?
Rob. That's what I said, rob.
- That's a fine thing to say.
- How else could you expect me to say it?
I certainly don't expect my own sister...
Yes, I'm glad.
I'm glad Dad isn't alive to see you insult
and humiliate me in defense of a cheap...
Oh, now, you stop that Trippy Trellis.
Skeffington doesn't need any defending.
- You...
- Don't you say another word. I feel sick.
- Of course...
- You make me sick.
You feel sick every time I say something
to you about something you've done.
Trippy, dear...
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.
- Why can't you leave me alone?
- Oh, Trippy, you mustn't.
You mustn't feel like this.
Everything will be all right, really.
No, it won't.
I've just been lucky so far.
Sooner or later,
everybody will know about me.
If Skeffington doesn't go to the police,
someday somebody will.
When that happens, I'll...
- When that happens, I'll kill myself.
- Trippy.
Trippy, don't say such things.
Don't even think such things.
Why do I do it?
Who do I get it from?
Not from Dad.
- He was a grand old gent, wasn't he?
- Yes, he was, Trippy.
Fanny...
... do you remember much about Mother?
Just that she was tall and very beautiful
and played the piano.
I'm glad she's not here...
... to see what I turned out to be.
Why, Trippy Trellis...
... she would love you very much.
Why don't you get dressed and come
have lunch with Janie Clarkson and me.
No, thanks.
- The thought of food...
- Oh, please do.
Janie's very amusing,
and she wears such funny hats.
Yes, Manby?
Some more flowers, Miss Trellis.
From Mr. Chester Forbish.
A very interesting man.
Who, Chester?
No, not Chester.
Skeffington Company, Casey speaking.
Seventeen and a half, sir.
Five hundred at 17 and a half? Yes, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- May I see Mr. Skeffington, please?
- Your name, please?
Miss Trellis.
Miss Anderson, there's a Miss Trellis
here to see Mr. Skeffington.
Yes, ma'am.
- Would you wait a moment, please?
- Thank you.
Will you try to locate Mr. Skeffington?
He's on the exchange floor.
- Yes, Miss Anderson.
- Supply and demand are hypothetical.
The thing to look out...
- Mr. Skeffington.
- How do you do, Miss Trellis? I didn't...
- Why didn't you tell me she was here?
- But...
That's quite all right, Mr. Skeffington...
... considering the fact that I'm
completely unexpected and uninvited.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
Mr. Skeffington, I want you to know
I didn't come here to talk about Trippy.
Good. It's a painful subject.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Cigar?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's automatic.
All my visitors are men.
I see.
Now, what can I do for you?
Mr. Skeffington, I came to ask you if you
would buy some tickets for a bazaar...
... or a musical...
... or it might even be a picnic.
- It's for some charity, I suppose.
Yes, it's for the Children's Hospital
or the Home for the Aged.
I don't quite remember.
Anyway, it's printed on the tickets.
That's funny. I was sure that
I'd brought them with me. They're $25.
They're both worthy causes.
I'll take a dozen tickets.
You will not. Two is quite enough.
Besides, you don't get a thing
for your money.
Or are you used to that?
Mr. Skeffington...
... do you mind very much
if I sit somewhere else?
That eagle looks as if
he were going to pounce on me...
... or whatever it is that eagles do.
- Are you sure he isn't still alive?
- Quite.
He's just stuffed.
Well, my poor little bird is stuffed too,
so maybe that's what appeals to him.
Perhaps you'd like to sit here?
She's very pretty.
Your wife?
No. I'm not married.
Your sister?
I have no family at all.
Well, she's very attractive, but I won't
pursue the subject any further.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah.
What is it now?
Buy 10,000 at 23 and a half.
Mr. Skeffington, please forgive me
for being so curious...
... but it sounds very important.
- Ten thousand what?
- Ten thousand shares of steel.
What's the 23 and a half?
Twenty-three and a half dollars a share.
Ten thousand at 23 and a half?
Oh, well, if you're that casual about money,
I'll let you buy the dozen tickets after all.
You know, the Trellis fortune
was made and lost here...
... and I've never once
seen the stock exchange.
I'd be glad to show you
around some time.
That's very nice of you,
but isn't it a little vague?
Could you make it right now?
I have an engagement with Janie Clarkson,
but we don't like each other...
... so she probably won't be there, either.
In that case, would you like
to have lunch with me?
Oh, I'd be delighted.
Then could I come back here
and see all this?
If you wish. Shall we go to the Waldorf?
Not the Waldorf.
That's where I'm not having lunch
with Janie Clarkson.
Yes?
What?
When?
What is happening, Mr. Skeffington?
- Terrible.
- What's terrible?
They've declared war.
War?
Get all our branch offices on the phone.
Keep a wire open to Washington.
Hello, Casey,
keep me informed on wheat.
- See the tape?
- Yes, I know.
- Steel is up to 28. Buy?
- Sell.
- Wheat's up 20. What do we do?
- Get word from Washington yet?
Mr. Skeffington, I've changed my mind.
I'm having lunch
with Janie Clarkson after all.
It's impossible, I tell you.
Miss Trellis, l...
It's really very flattering, Mr. Vanyi.
Isn't it, Georgie?
Won't you tell me
who commissioned you to paint it?
- I'm sorry, Miss Trellis.
- You're very stubborn.
Yes. Now look here, Mr. Vanyi,
I'll pay you double. I want that portrait.
Sorry, but my client is paying me
four times my usual fee.
- Confound it, who is this client?
- The extra money is to keep me quiet.
You see, Jim, it's no use.
- But look here, l...
- Excuse me. That must be the transfer man.
He can't do this to me.
One moment, Mr. Vanyi.
We'll settle this here and now.
Fanny, it's not like you.
All these hours sitting for a portrait
you won't own...
... for a man you don't even know.
Why did you do it?
I think it's very romantic, Georgie.
An unknown admirer...
... commissions the foremost
portrait painter of the day to paint me.
And besides, as Mr. Vanyi said...
... he offered to donate $ 1000
to my favorite charity.
Oh, I see.
Georgie, I was wondering...
... would it be considered charity
if we use the money for Trippy?
Well, a thousand dollars wouldn't help
much, so we might just as well be honest.
By the way, have you heard
from Mr. Skeffington?
I almost had lunch with him
several weeks ago.
But it was the very day that war was
declared, and it spoiled everything.
I must say, he's been decent.
He hasn't called me in all this time.
- Sooner or later we've got to tell him.
- I suppose we have, Georgie.
I've only been able to raise four,
$5000 and that's the limit.
Goodness, I almost forgot.
I have a date with Janie Clarkson.
Oh, how is Janie?
I don't know.
Haven't seen her for months.
I'll remember this, Mr. Vanyi.
Fanny, this man's impossible. He won't
give me the slightest hint who it is.
- Jim, I really don't care.
- Don't care?
What if we walk into a saloon some day
and see you over the bar?
- I doubt very much I'll ever get that drunk.
- Now, Fanny...
I really have to be going now.
Goodbye, Mr. Vanyi.
I'm afraid it was
a frightful ordeal.
- No, you were a charming subject.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, Jim. Come, Manby.
Can I drop you somewhere?
No, thank you very much.
Why don't you drop George.
Oh, Georgie?
Would you phone Janie,
and tell her I can't see her?
Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Fanny.
Will thou pledge thy troth to him?
In love and honor?
In faith and tenderness?
To live with him and cherish him?
- I will.
- Have you the ring, sir?
- Yes.
- Good. You will repeat after me.
- In token and pledge...
- In token and pledge...
... of our faith...
... of our faith...
... and abiding love.
... and abiding love.
By authority committed unto me
as justice of the peace...
... I declare Job Skeffington and Frances
Trellis are now husband and wife...
... according to the laws and statutes
of the state of New Jersey.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
It's a privilege of the justice
of the peace to kiss the bride.
May I please use your phone?
Job, I was born right across
the river there, near Grant's Tomb.
Of course, the tomb
hadn't quite been built.
My governess used to
take me there every day.
That's where she met her policeman.
Job, where were you born?
Right here in New York.
The corner of Market and Cherry Street.
Market and Cherry? Where's that?
Foot of the East River. It's about 10 miles,
I should say, from the nearest governess.
Job, do you realize I've known you
only two months?
And that I practically know
nothing about you at all.
Were you poor?
You have no idea how poor.
You weren't actually hungry?
My father sold chocolate bars
with almond nuts on a pushcart.
When he had a good day, we ate meat.
When he had a bad day,
we ate chocolate bars with almond nuts.
The bad days had a slight edge.
You remember a lot about
when you were a little boy, don't you?
Especially the lack of plumbing.
Skeffington, that's a strange name
for Market and Cherry.
You mean, is that my real name?
No. The immigration official on
Ellis Island wasn't a good speller...
... and "Skeffington" was the closest
he could get to "Skevinzskaza. "
Well, then, how did you
become so successful?
I don't wanna go on
with the story of my life.
It's routine, rags to riches.
Of course, I sold newspapers.
I was a messenger during the day
and went to school at night.
You can fill in the rest.
There's one difference.
You didn't marry the boss's daughter.
No.
But I married the woman
everybody else wanted to.
That makes up for it.
Job, find out what's happening.
Attendant?
- Yes?
- What's going on?
That's Tony, Joe and Luigi,
serenading a couple that got married.
They go looking for them.
- How do they tell?
- I don't know, but they do.
You know, they ain't messed up
on a couple in over 10 years.
Can you beat that?
Job, could you tell
they've just been married?
He's a very lucky boy.
I think I could.
They way she's looking at him,
you couldn't miss it.
I see what you mean.
The way I'm looking at you.
No. Your look is cordial,
not connubial.
I've married you,
but I haven't won you.
Job.
No.
So far, I've merely taken you
away from the others.
Do you think that night
I broke into your party...
... do you think that was
the first time I'd seen you?
No. I'd seen you many times before that.
Dining at Sherry's.
Dancing at the Waldorf.
You never noticed me.
When I saw you the night
I came to see Trippy...
... you looked very beautiful.
Very unattainable.
That's why I commissioned Vanyi
to paint your portrait.
At least, I'd have that.
Well, now you have both.
The portrait and me.
What you mean is I own both.
It isn't quite the same thing.
Do you know why I came to your office
that day to sell you bazaar tickets?
Because I'd made up my mind even then
that I was going to marry you.
- Why?
- Because you're good and kind...
... and your eyes are special
in a St. Bernard sort of way.
And although I've never
really seen you smile...
... I always have the feeling
you're laughing at me.
And I find that attractive.
Besides the fact you're very rich.
Would you like to kiss me?
We're about to be serenaded.
Skeffington.
Does he hunt? Does he sail?
Does he do anything worthwhile?
I'm not gonna be a hypocrite,
but Fanny's treated me shabbily.
- In an underhanded way.
- I don't see where you come in.
You never stood a chance.
I'm the jilted one.
That's rich, you two.
I'm the one who's unhappy.
- I'm the one who has...
- You unhappy?
I notice you're starting in
on your third sandwich.
At least I didn't hog
the white meat.
- Wait...
- I only had one sandwich...
Wait a minute. It can't be that bad.
- White meat or dark?
- Dark or white, what's the difference now?
That must be Fanny.
Gentlemen, let me speak to her first.
And there's still some turkey left.
Hello.
Georgie, dear.
Well, I, for one, am delighted.
Why do you say, "I, for one"?
Thatcher's here,
Morrison's here, Conderley's here.
Congratulations, sir.
That idiot, Chester, is here.
The time I've had.
They're all eating cold turkey.
I've had to feed them,
but you're gonna console them.
Well, Job, in that case,
shall we get it over with?
I don't know if I'm up to it.
They're full of turkey. I'm not.
- Georgie, do you know where Trippy is?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Fanny.
- Fanny, dear.
I rather expected you'd all be here
to welcome me.
I don't believe you've ever met
Mr. Skeffington, have you?
Job, Mr. Conderley, Mr. Thatcher,
Mr. Forbish and Mr. Morrison.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- How do you do, gentlemen?
- Fanny.
I see that George has done
very well by you.
- Fanny.
- Yes, Chester, darling?
- My sister come in, Soames?
- Yes. She's downstairs.
Now that you've finished the meat course,
perhaps I could get you some dessert.
- Excuse me, Morry.
- Fanny...
I'm afraid the best I can do
is canned peaches.
George, would you bring me
a can opener, please?
Well, if it isn't
Mr. And Mrs. Skeffington.
- Trippy, darling. Then you've heard.
- Of course.
Everybody knows about it.
It's in the papers.
Were we on the front page?
Not quite. You're listed
under "business transactions. "
Trippy, you'd better go
up to your room.
Shame on you, boys.
Letting yourselves be outbid.
- Wait a minute. You're drunk.
- It's his fault I'm drunk.
When they read the news at the club,
they gave me credit.
- Oh, Trippy.
- Fanny, you'd better go upstairs.
Oh, I'm gonna be challenged.
He's gonna heave
his checkbook in my face.
You don't know what
you're saying.
I was the one who swindled you.
- Why did you put her in jail?
- Go upstairs.
- Leave me alone.
- You're a swine.
If he's a gentleman,
a swine is what I wanna be.
- Trippy, you're excited.
- Shut up.
You all make me sick to my stomach.
- Would you please excuse me?
- Fanny.
No, Job.
It's all right, George.
I don't know what you're gonna do,
but I'm gonna have another sandwich.
Trippy.
Trippy, how could you?
How could you?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
- I didn't even know you were seeing him.
- I was afraid to tell you, Trippy.
Because I knew how you felt about him.
But you're wrong.
He has character. And he's a...
Don't tell me you're in love with him.
I'm not drunk enough to bear that.
I'll tell you this much, Trippy.
You're safe now.
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore.
And you can spend
all the money you want to.
Oh, I see. It's me.
That's why you married him.
Trippy, I'm very fond of Job...
... but I love you.
Well, who said I was leading
a useless life?
I brought you two together, didn't I?
I played Cupid, didn't I?
Trippy, go down and apologize.
Apologize? I'll spit in his eye.
Trippy, listen to me. You're being
so stubborn, and you're wrong.
When you get to know Job, you...
I'm taking good care
I don't get to know him.
I'm going to Europe.
Europe? Well, isn't there a war on there?
That's it. This war's a godsend.
Give me something to do.
Trippy. Do you mean you're actually
going to fight?
What else do you do in a war?
Our country isn't at war.
Who will you fight for?
I haven't decided.
I might join the Germans.
- I'll toss a coin.
- Oh, Trippy, you're out of your mind.
And humiliated. And sick.
I hate him. I hate myself.
I'll send a boy from the club for these.
Trippy. If you love me at all,
you won't leave.
I love you very much...
... but I despise Mrs. Skeffington.
Trippy.
Trippy!
Trippy.
Fanny.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Trellis.
Mr. Skeffington is waiting
for you, sir.
- In the library.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Job.
- Hello, George. You're late.
I wanted my flowers
to get here before I did.
- They're beautiful. Fanny was delighted.
- Good.
- You like a drink?
- Thank you.
A friend from a newsreel company
has sent over the latest war pictures.
- Would you like to see them?
- I should say I would.
- We'll look at them after dinner.
- Good.
- Job.
- Thank you, George.
Think Fanny will like it?
It's much too good for her.
- What did she give you for your anniversary?
- Cigarette holder. It's beautiful.
Even though I've given up smoking.
- Just we three for dinner?
- No. Probably Ed Morrison.
He barged in. He's upstairs.
- Doesn't he know it's your first anniversary?
- Oh, yes.
He chose this night especially to ask
for my wife's hand in marriage.
I sent him up to Fanny.
She makes all the domestic arrangements.
Your marrying Fanny
hasn't discouraged any of her suitors?
On the contrary.
Before they just wanted to marry her.
Now, they seem to feel
they have to rescue her.
Do you know she has to reject them all
on the average of about twice a month?
Not too firmly, I suppose.
The trouble with Fanny is,
she's soft-hearted.
She's so kind to them all.
So gentle and considerate.
And how has she been with you, Job?
She's been kind and gentle
and considerate.
That isn't quite what you want, is it?
I'm a very patient man, George.
I'll leave, but remember,
I haven't given up yet.
That would be Morrison. Thank you.
- This what you're looking for?
- Yes.
You're not going to let this
interfere with dinner.
This is no joking matter, Skeffington.
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
- Hello, Georgie.
- Hello, Fanny.
Good evening, Job, dear.
Did Job tell you how delighted
I was with your flowers?
Yes, he did. Thanks.
Do you like my gown, Job?
You look beautiful, Fanny. Beautiful.
Thank you.
Fanny.
Job Skeffington.
You know, George, I keep forgetting that
Job can afford to give me things like this.
How very sweet of you, Job.
I'm simply famished.
- Soames, is dinner ready?
- Yes, madam.
One thing about these proposals,
they give Fanny a whale of an appetite.
"King and queen of England lay
cornerstone for new army hospital. "
- He looks like a very nice man.
- He is.
"Kaiser and Field Von Marshall
Hindenberg inspect crack German... "
They all look exactly alike,
don't they?
I don't like the looks
of any of them, madam.
Just like a machine.
A friend was telling me they start them
goose-stepping when they're 2 years old.
No fooling.
"Another naval victory for the Allies. "
Oh, how dreadful.
Those poor men.
Lafayette Escadrille.
Georgie, isn't that Trippy?
I don't know. It went by so fast.
I couldn't see.
Georgie, it is Trippy.
What did the title say?
Where is he?
- Somewhere in France.
- Do you suppose he really flies a plane?
He must, if he's a member
of the Lafayette Escadrille.
Georgie, would you please
get me a glass of wa... ?
- Fanny.
- Something wrong?
Oh, Mrs. Skeffington.
George, call Dr. Fawcett on the phone.
Oh, Mrs. Skeffington.
Nothing to worry about.
She's absolutely all right.
- Fine.
- I suppose it was the shock...
... of seeing her brother on the screen.
- It wasn't entirely that.
What do you mean?
I usually make a ceremony
of these things...
... but I've a patient uptown I must get to,
so I'll tell you right out.
You're going to be a father.
Why, thank you.
All I can say to you is good night.
And, doctor? Is it all right
if I go in to see her?
Certainly. I've given her a sedative...
... but you'll have five minutes
for the usual nonsense.
Don't put on the light, Job.
I've been crying.
Is there anything I can do for you?
No.
Would you like to be alone?
No.
Shall I come sit on the bed
and talk to you?
No.
You mean I'm just to keep on standing
where I am in the dark.
I suppose it's the custom for the father
to kiss the expectant mother.
I'm very happy, Fanny.
How about you?
Well, at the moment,
I'm more surprised than happy.
Don't you like children?
No. They always seem to be so wise.
Well, I think any child of ours has
a fair chance of being stupid, Fanny.
You're laughing at me again.
I suppose I'm just as fond
of children as anybody else.
Well, it's just that...
It's just that babies grow up, and everybody
expects you to grow up with them.
You're not afraid
of growing old, are you, Fanny?
Yes, I am.
Well, babies stay young
for quite a long time.
Other people's babies, never your own.
Do I look puffy yet?
You look beautiful, Fanny.
I don't know why.
My face is all tear-stained.
Just enough to be becoming.
Well, I wanted to keep on crying,
but I didn't have the strength.
You see, the sedative the doctor gave me
made me very drowsy.
Soon, I'll be all swollen
and puffy and ugly.
I don't want anybody to see me
like that. I couldn't bear it.
Job, George is going to California
in a week. I want to go with him...
... and have my baby there.
You don't want to have
your baby in this house?
No.
But, Fanny, you love this house so much.
Why, you made me
give up my home and live here.
Of course I love this house,
but it's too close to my friends.
I won't have them see me
all swollen and ugly.
You'll never be ugly, Fanny.
And I don't care how swollen you look.
Fanny, a woman is beautiful
when she's loved. And only then.
Nonsense. A woman is beautiful
if she has eight hours' sleep...
... and goes to the
beauty parlor every day.
And bone structure
has a lot to do with it too.
But I'm so busy in New York,
and California is a six-day train trip.
I won't be able to see you very often.
I'll write you every week, Job.
Fanny, that's not the point.
I want to be near you.
I'm so sleepy.
All right, Fanny. You can go
to California if you want to.
Fanny, aren't you really happy
about having... ?
Good afternoon, Mrs. Skeffington.
Some more flowers from your husband.
- "Condition excellent. "
- Yes, I know she's all right...
... but if I could just hear her voice.
- I'm sorry. She's asleep.
All right.
Goodbye.
A girl? Wonderful.
How's Fanny?
Tell me, did you look at the baby's feet?
I mean, has she got all her toes?
Here, cover that up.
- Hello, darling.
- Fanny, here's your mother.
- Good afternoon, Marie.
- Good afternoon.
- Have you been a good girl?
- Of course, she's been a good girl.
Kiss your uncle Georgie, Fanny.
- Mrs. Skeffington?
- Yes, Marie?
- Professor Hyslop's waiting at the house.
- Thank you.
- You coming in, Job?
- Not yet. I'd like to watch Fanny play.
Don't be long. The dinner's at 8.
- Chester and Freddie are going with us.
- Think they'd mind if I came along?
Oh, Job.
Come on, sweetheart. Come on.
Sit down here with your father.
Oh, you're wonderful.
You're wonderful.
I've got something for you.
- Little Sambo.
- Sambo?
Job, who's this Professor Hyslop?
He's some young fellow.
He's not a professor.
Speaks on street corners or something.
- Isn't he that evangelist?
- He's not that either.
He's got a cult all his own.
I think it has to do with deep breathing
on a vegetable diet.
- What's he doing with Fanny?
- He doesn't consider her a disciple.
He's one of the new suitors
that came along when I went to camp.
Fanny's still having suitors.
Ought not you to be a little more
firm about that?
Fanny cannot live on oxygen alone.
She's got to be surrounded by men.
- But she doesn't have to lead them on.
- She doesn't.
She just sits, and they come to her.
It doesn't mean anything.
I think she handles them well.
It saves me the trouble
of sending flowers and candy.
I think you could give the original Job
a few pointers on patience.
Well, there's little Fanny.
She makes up for a lot of things.
I'm glad she's a girl. You can kiss
your daughter for the rest of your life.
With a boy, well, after a while,
you have to start shaking hands.
It's getting cool, and it's
Fanny's dinnertime.
Come on, darling.
Daddy's gonna watch you have dinner.
- Dada.
- What did you say, darling?
Dads, how I get to be so little?
Come along.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Dada?
Now, what is it?
Oh, no, no. You've been twice already.
You go to sleep, and I'll send your mommy
in to say good night to you.
I've taken counsel with myself, Fanny,
and my conscience is clear.
It's true it's written that, whom God hath
joined together, let no man put asunder.
But it is also inscribed,
worship ye at the temple.
To me, Fanny, you are a temple
wherein I may worship.
But, Myles, don't you see
I'm all wrong for you.
I don't breathe properly.
I love steaks and roasts.
- I can't bear the sight of a vegetable.
- Fanny.
- Fanny, you're laughing at me.
- I can't help it, Myles.
Fanny, how can you do this to me?
My life is ruined now.
Destiny brought us together,
and destiny cries out for fulfillment.
Well, are we ready to go?
In just a while.
The professor is proposing to Fanny.
He'll be down in a minute.
Goodbye, Fanny. Forever.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What have you got, son?
- Telegram for Mrs. Skeffington.
- I'll take it.
All right. Sign here, please.
It's from the War Department.
Thank you.
Trippy?
- Fanny?
- I won't be five minutes, Job.
Could I speak to you?
Would you mind waiting?
I'm in a rush.
Manby, get my pearls, will you?
It's important.
It's a telegram.
- A telegram, Job? From whom?
- From the War Department.
It isn't anything about Trippy, is it?
Could we sit down
for a moment, please?
What is it, Job?
Fanny...
... Trippy has been killed in action.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, not Trippy.
My poor, darling Trippy.
And I loved him so.
- Fanny.
- I told him not to go to war. I told him.
- I told him.
- Fanny, let me say something to you.
- Will you please?
- No, no. Leave me alone.
Trippy's dead.
George.
George.
George, go up to Fanny.
- I'll get some brandy. Maybe that'll help.
- Right.
It's all right, Manby.
- Fanny, darling, you mustn't.
- Oh, George.
If it hadn't been for Job,
Trippy never would've gone to war.
- Now, you mustn't say it.
- He killed Trippy. He killed him.
- Fanny, you know that isn't true.
- Yes, he did.
And I'll go on living with him
for the rest of my life.
For the rest of my life,
he'll keep looking at me...
... with those puppy-dog eyes of his.
So good and so kind.
It's so sickening.
Job loves you very much. You know that.
It's really funny, Georgie.
I married Job
so I could take care of Trippy.
And now Trippy is gone.
And all I've got is Job.
Some brandy?
Isn't it a trifle immodest?
No, no, madam. Not immodest.
Daring, maybe.
- What do you think, {y:i}monsieur?
- Delightfully so, I should say.
And if Mr. Skeffington calls, Manby...
... tell him I won't be home for dinner.
{y:i}You have just heard an address
{y:i}by Alfred E. Smith, governor of New York.
How about a game of billiards tonight?
Sorry, I have to go home.
Ask Skeffington.
He's usually free.
That was the most wonderful time
I've ever had in my life.
Do you remember the time
at Cape Cod?
Remember to forget it...
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Surely.
Certainly, Fanny.
You're the notorious Mr. MacMahon.
Yeah.
And you're Fanny Skeffington.
Good stuff, huh, bud?
- I suppose it's right off the boat, eh?
- Yeah. They scraped if off.
Oh, Mr. Mac.
Come in. Come in, Mr. Mac.
- Hi, Joe. How's business?
- Business? Wonderful.
Got a new load today. Right off the boat.
Right out of the bathtub, you mean.
Come on, Fanny.
- Hi, Mac. Glad to see you.
- Louie. Got a good table?
I'll make a good table.
Throw somebody out.
This way, please.
Thank you.
- I'll see that you get the special stuff, Mac.
- Thanks, Louie.
Mac, is this one of your places?
I don't know. I may have a piece of it.
Cigarette?
No, thank you. I have my special kind.
My, my.
Beautiful. Beautiful.
- Ain't she beautiful?
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
I got a friend I want you to see.
I mean, I want him to see you.
Okay. Beat it, beat it.
Beat it?
