...duty to welcome you
here on the behalf of...
...all the other artists, and musicians
with combined talents...
...went in to the creation of this
new form of entertainment: Fantasia.
What you'll see on the screen...
...is a picture of various abstract images...
...that might pass to your mind...
...if you seat in a concert hall,
listening to this music.
Now, there are three kinds
of music on this fantasia program.
First is the kind
that tells a definite story.
Then there's the kind that,
while has no specific plot...
...does paint a series
of more or less definite pictures.
And there's the third kind;
music that exist simply for tones sake.
And the number that opens
out Fantasia program...
...is music of this third kind.
You know, what's amazing is that many of
these musicians are playing for the very first time.
Thanks to Steve Martin's two week
Master Musician Home Study Course.
More about that later.
Hello and welcome
to Fantasia 2000.
 It's been more that 60 years since
Walt Disney and his artists teamed up...
...with Maestro Leopold Stokowski
to create a film they titled: The Concert Feature.
I think, we're all glad that they
changed the name to Fantasia.
You know, Fantasia was meant
to be a perpetual work in progress.
Every time you went to see it, you'd experience
some new pieces along of some old familiar favorites 
But that idea felt
by the way side until now.
So, let me turn things over
to the great Itzhak Perlman...
...who, I've just been informed,
plays the violin.
Well, so do I.
Can I have my violin, please?
Ah, thank you.
All right, boys.
Hoo. Oh, sorry.
Could I have another string thingy please?
Oh, and camera back on me?
Camera back on me!
When you hear a title like Pines of Rome,
you might think of tree line streets and romantic ruins.
But when the Disney animators
heard this music...
...they thought of something
completely different.
Here is the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
conducted by Maestro James Levin...
...performing Ottorino Respigi's
Pines of Rome.
Hi. Next, we're gonna take you
to the streets of New York City...
...for piece that's been inspired
by couple of my favorite artists.
First, there's the illustrator Al Hirschfeld,
who's been drawing celebrities and
Broadway stars for most of the 20th century.
And then, there's the composer
and song writer George Gerschwin,
who took Jazz off the streets,
dressed her up and took it to the concert hall.
My friend Ralph Grierson
plays piano on this next number.
And it all starts with the single slinky note
on the clarinet and a simple line on a piece of paper.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Rhapsody in Blue.
Hi. You may not know this,
but over the years...
...the Disney artists have cooked up
dozens of ideas for new Fantasia segments.
Some of them made it
to the big screen this time...
but others, lots of others
- how can I put this politely - didn't.
For example:
The Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen...
...drew these sketches for a segment
inspired by Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.
Here they are.
And there they go.
Now, Salvador Dali, you know,
the limp watches guy...
he got in to the act with an idea that
featured baseball as a metaphor for life.
How come that didn't work?
Makes perfect sense to me!
Let's see. Then, we had a bug ballet, and a baby ballet, and for a time,
they even considered the sequence inspired by the polka and the fuge.
From Weinberger's Schwanda, the bagpiper.
But finally - a success.
The Disney artists wanted to create a short film
based on Hans Christian Anderson's wonderful fairytale -
The Steadfast Tin Soldier. But they could
never find the perfect musical match.
Until now.
Here is Yefim Bronfman playing
Schostakovich Piano Concerto No. 2...
...and the Steadfast Tin Soldier.
These drawing boards are then the birthplace
of some of the most beloved animal characters of all time.
So, as no surprise, that the artists
chose for our next segment...
...the Carnival of the Animals
by Camille Saint-Saans.
Here, the sensitive strains of impressionistic music
combined with the artistry of the animator...
that finally answer the age-all question:
What is man's relationship to nature?
Oh, sorry. That age-all question:
What would happen,
if you gave a yo-yo to a flock of flamingos?
Who wrote this?
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to take a moment if we may...
...to talk about little something
we like to refer to as - magic.
Picture this. You're at home,
hosting a birthday party for your daughter...
...and you've just shoveled out
50 bucks, saw some...
...pathetic looser who can pull
a mangy rabbit out of a flea-market hat.
At first, you might wonder
to yourself - how did he do that?
But then you'd probably just
dismiss that it is some sort of a trick.
And you know something?
You'd be right!
It's just a trick!
It's an example what we're laughing
when we refer to as stage magic.
We're here to tell you that all stage magic
is a fraud, a hoax, a shabb -
- it's all based on deception and
- Yep - laying. All of it.
Slider hand - lies!
Transformations - fraud!
Dismemberment - rip off!
Fake.
All are illusions.
What we're here
to talk about is real magic.
We're gonna bring out a guy, now
who is the real deal, the genuine article - in fact...
...he taught us everything we know.
And he's featured prominently
in the next sequence from the original Fantasia.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice.
You know, come to think of it,
the Sorcerer's Apprentice is a little guy who...
...who never speaks and just
kinda messes everything up.
And now...
And now...
And now:
The Sorcerer's Apprentice.
Mr. Stokowski?
Mr. Stokowski!
Just wanted to offer
my congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, Mickey.
Haha, gee, thanks.
Well, gotta run, now. Soloing!
Mr. Levine! Ok, Mr. Levine.
Everybody is in place for the next number.
Thanks, Mickey.
Psst!
When...
But we can't find Donald. So you stay
here and stall for time, I'll be right back.
Donald!
Oh, Donald!
When we hear Sir Edward Elgar's Pomp and
Circumstance, we think of a graduation ceremony.
Donald, where are you?
Actually, Elgar composed it for many kinds of solemn events.
This march inspired the Disney artists
to recreate the age-all story...
Aaaa!
Oh, sorry, Daisy.
...of Noah's arch, with one slight twist...
Oh, Donald Duck!
Who is it?
Donald, it's me, Mickey. You're on in 30 second. Hurry!
What? You're gotta be kidding on me...
Ok, Jim, he's on his way.
Go to the intro.
Ladies and gentlemen, Pomp and Circumstance.
Starring: Donald Duck.
Walt Disney described the art
of animation as a voyage of discovery...
...into the realms of color,
sound, and motion.
The music form Igor Straviski's ballet
The Firebird inspires such a voyage.
And so, we conclude this version of Fantasia
with a mythical story of life, death, and renewal.
Camera back on me!
Oh, camera back on me, please!
Anyone, hello! Hello?
Could someone give me a ride home?
