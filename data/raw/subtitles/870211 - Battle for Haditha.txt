(boy, that was a piece of work...)
What do you wanna know?
I live in a shit barracks,
constant threat.
I get shot at any minute,
through any window.
I wake up every morning,
do the same patrols every day.
And basically,
the only thing I'm fighting for
that I know that I'm fighting for
is to make it home
each and every day
without getting killed.
Because I don't know why we're here.
Oh I know why we're here
but I don't know--
Yeah, I don't know
why we're here.
I mean, I've seen a...
I'd say about
60 year old woman
all dressed in black,
in a burqa, or whatever
they call them dresses.
pull out an AK from under her skirt
and starts spraying.
Needless to say,
she got-- I mean,
she became a combattant,
and that's the truth, you know.
Like...men, women, child,
if they pick up a gun and start
shooting at you
they are considered combattants
and that's reality.
It's also just like hunting.
I've hunted deer and
coyotes and shit.
It's like a person
thinks the same,
tries to think like
another person would.
with a weapon.
So, it's luck.
It's the ultimate style of hunting,
is war.
(Battle for Haditha)
Like, this is the planet Earth.
The body, right?
Body is planet Earth.
and Iraq...is the cornhole,
the brown hole, the asshole,
whatever you wanna call it.
with a bunch of dingleberries.
Insurgents. (leaders)
A bunch of dingleberries
hanging around,
just waiting for a shit storm.
And we just happen to
be the fucking turds...
going through
the asshole.
And all the dingleberries
are just surrounding us,
trying to kill us.
That's what I think about Iraq.
Just a giant butthole.
(On 19th November 2005 an IED bomb...
(planted in the roadside
in Haditha, Iraq)
(...killed 1 Marine
and injured 2 others. )
(In the following
hours Marines killed 24)
(Iraqi men, women and children. )
(18th November, 2005, 6:30 am)
Hey Jack!
Fuck ya!
I love that shit!
Look at my fucking ass!
Hey! This is why I fucking
love the Marine Corps.
All right, let's move!
Hey Corporal Marquez.
Take a fire team across the street.
Yeah.
Look look look.
Hey!
What the fuck dawg!
I've never seen a dick that small.
Hurry up, put your little dick away.
Let's go!
- You hear that?
- Aye Corporal.
His dick is so small,
he's peeing on his nuts.
- Hurry up, get back in formation.
- OohRah.
- Ey Cuthbert.
- Yes, corporal.
- You ready to get some?
- Hua.
Found 119 IEDs,
(Improvised explosive device)
and these faggots are playing
at the side of the road.
All the insurgents
came from Falludja.
They are all here,
waiting for us.
- You know that, right?
- Yes corporal.
We're just life bait
And you retards stop fucking around.
(Haditha)
(60 Marines killed in
I.E.D. bomb attacks)
(29 Iraqi Police Officers
publicly executed...)

* Let's get three chickens.
* What else?
* And anything else we need.
* Chickens.
* The chickens.
Chickens?
* You want to look?
* Thank you.
* Quickly.
* Those Al Qaeda idiots just
killed the English teacher.
* Do you want tea?
* Bring me a drink.
Democracy will succeed because every
month, more and more Iraqis
are fighting for their own country.
People we have liberated
will not surrender their freedom.
Democracy will succeed
because the USA
will not be intimidated
by a bunch of thugs!

...corner of Chestnut...
(unintelligible chatter on radio)
- You got DVDs?
- Yeah, sure I got.
You want? Yeah.
Are these the only DVDs you have?
Let me imagine what you're looking for.
You're looking for...
- Boom boom?
- Boom Boom!
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah. All right.
Try it and you must trust me.
So I didn't trust you?
Yeah, I don't trust you motherfuckers
for anything.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I leave you with my uncle,
he will give you a good deal, okay?
* Did you bring the stuff?
* Turn left.
* When we pick it up
* they will show us how to trigger it.
* Ok.
* Do they know where they want it put?
* They know.
* What's that?
* If the foreign fighters
smell the alcohol,
* they'll kill me.
* Breathe.
* It's ok.
* Listen Jafar, these Al
Qaeda guys are fucking crazy.
* Let's go.
* Here it is.
* See this?
* It goes inside the bomb.
* But be careful, any electrical
charge will set it off.
* Understand?
* Good. Then you attach the cellphone.
* A cellphone.
* Exactly.
* Then you switch the phone on
* and pull out the aerial.
* When you bury it
* leave part of the aerial above ground
* for the frequency.
* OK.
* Do you understand?
* Yes, God willing.
* This cellphone will trigger the bomb
* when you call this number.
* When the humvees get close to the bomb
* just dial this number
* and the bomb will explode.
* OK.
* Do you understand?
* That's $500.
* You'll get another 500
if you are successful.
* The money is your reward on earth
* God will reward you in heaven.
* The holy war is for the muslims.
* You should get going.
* Everything is ready.
* Ahmad, I want to tell you something.
* Stay away from the alcohol venders.
* What? Who told you I drink alcohol?
* Heay Ahmad, I'm not blind.
* We know everything you do.
* We're giving the alcohol venders
3 days to stop selling.
* And if they don't stop
* we will kill them.
* You know you shouldn't drink alcohol.
* It's against the teaching of Islam
* And we need Haditha
to be an Islamic city.
Hey Marcus, check this
fucking video out.
I bought this downtown, at the
electrical shop
off of a bunch of fucking kids.
It was on Al Qaeda TV,
they burned it to a DVD,
It's all our guys.
They were here before us,
patroling the same fucking streets.
Makes my ? ? ? fucking ? ? ?
Let's kill the motherfuckers more.
Kill more people.
If they are gonna go out
and do this shit to us,
we should kill more of them, you know?
You're gotta be kidding me
that's all I'm saying.
- I am not fucking dying in Iraq.
- Oh yeah?
You gotta die in Iraq
- I'd rather die fucking drowning...
On a rag.
You wouldn't die in Iraq.
You would die on what?
- Surfing, something like that.
- Surfing? Yeah.

? ? ? butt surfing?
Shot.
Shot ? ? ?
Shark is ? ? ?
- Ramirez.

- Why did you join the Marines?
- Why did I join the Marines?
- Yeah.
- To get the fuck out of Philadelphia.
There was nothing for me.
- What was wrong with Philly?
- What the fuck was wrong with Philly?
Bad ski sticks. ? ? ?
It was the year of the
ski sticks depression,
and...everything was going downhill.
No man.
I mean, it's the murder capital.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
Let me guess.
You wass in a gang.
No, actually, Philadelphia
doesn't even have gangs, dude.
So you left the murder capital of the US
to come to Falludja
the head of the
murder capitals of the world.
- These are in one war zone...
Good job, you're moving up, buddy!
...here is the Apache nearby.
Suspect seen on highway one
to the east.
Who the fuck are they?
I don't know who's fucking

I think they are talking
about misanderstanding...

A copper just smacked a 50 cal

The guy's ? ? ?
* There's a lot of cars.
* It's a checkpoint.
* It's jammed.
* And we still need food for the party.
* Fuck.
* Typical Americans.
* Now that we've been liberated
* we have to wait for hours.
* It pisses me off.
* We got no water, no electricity,
* our kids can't even go to school.
* This is Haditha!
* The place where people would come
on their honeymoon.
* Now it's known as the City of Death.
* It makes me weep.
* Listen,
* when we get to the checkpoint
* just act casually.
* Don't be nervous, we'll be ok.
(radio chatter)
C'mon. Come here.
Come on.
Go over there.
? ? ?

Now stay there.
Step this way, please.
Stop. Put your hands up.
Put your hands up.

Come, hurry up.
Go.
Stop.
Get your hands in the air.
Put your hands in the air.
- Away from the door?
- Yes.
(Insurgents could kill your children)
- Make it good.
- Come, hurry up.
* Useless.
* I told you they wouldn't find it.
* Have you heard the latest joke?
* An american joke?
* Listen to this one.
* George Bush is in a
meeting with his advisors,
* and they talk about how
they are solving world peace
* when he gets a phone call telling him
* the biggest bank in
America just got robbed.
* Bush listens in amazement
and says how is that possible?
* All the thieves are sitting with me!
...
...
(10.00 am)
* Chickens.
....
* Our Baby will be born
* in 6 months time.
* Will you look after
my baby when it's born?
* Just like my brother or sister.
* Really?
* Really, how?
* I will take the baby to the market.
* Look at the goats.
* Look at the beautiful palm tree,
* It's always full of dates.
* Come here quick.
* Come up, I've got
something to tell you.
* I've really got something to tell you!
* Quickly.
* Are you sick?
* Wait.
* Will you still want me as much
* when I've had the baby?
* One hundred babies
and I'd still want you.
* It's great we're past the checkpoint
* but I'm worried
there might be another.
Here you go, son.
- Here you go.
- You just wait, man.
Don't fall asleep.
Go, go...
Nice bag
How are you doing, sir.
What have you got?

Last time I tell you, the fucking
bolt was dry like a fucking...
80 O'Grady's fucking coochie.
(8-year old? ? ? ? )
Think that's funny?
I don't think so.
Your weapon's jammed
It's not funny then,
but funny ? ? ?
Shut up.
Get on your fucking face right now.
Hey! Douchebag.
Get on your face.
What's up with the fucking jokes?
Sorry sergeant.
Say: I will not be funny anymore.
- I will not be--
- Louder!
...funny anymore.
I will not be funny anymore! !
- Ey Cuthbert.
- Yo.
Come here.
What's up?
You're not ? ? ? on your ass?
You don't like me?
No, 'cause you fucking
remind me of me, dipshit.
On my first appointment, man,
I almost lost my fucking leg.
They sat here and fucking told me
I would never be able
to fucking run again.
Fuck...
Doesn't the corps take care of you
after you're hurt?
You know, they offered me
to get out, right?
They said if I wanted
to, I could get out...
with my injury.
They said, we'll give you 10 per cent.
Do you know what 10 per cent is?
That's...$300 a month.
That's what I'm telling you.
Nobody gives a shit about you but you.
Take care of yourself.
The Marine corps don't,
and this fucking country don't
Remember that.

Smash you in the grate with my E2, baby.

- OoRah, sarge.
- I don't fucking feel it.
- OORAH, sarge.
I'm ready to take down
the fucking Iraq here,
sarge.
I know you are.
That's good.
That's why we train, train, train
to kill, kill, kill.
- I've got my motivation right here.
- ? ? ?
- She's always in my mind.
- There you go, there you go.
She also goes into my helmet.
I'm married,
and when I'm ready for battle
and I'm about to put it on,
I stare at her
and I remember
why I'm fighting this war:
To protect freedom and her.
- She's watching over you.
- Well done.

Everyone stack, everyone stack,

Go.
This is a hostile environment.
Everyone in there, man woman, child,

- You understand that?
- OoRah!
Women will strap a fucking bomb
on them
if they lost a son.
Or a husband.
They will strap a bomb to a baby.
To them, they're going to heaven
if they kill us.
You go in this house,
anybody has a weapon.
Anyone is hiding behind
someone with a weapon.
They all go!
Don't think twice,
it's gonna get someone killed!
- You understand that?
- OoRah.
(1.30 pm)
* Stop!
* This is the place.
* The goats are worth money.
* They aren't free.

* Why are you stopping old man?
* This is the last thing
I expected to be doing.
* I should have been getting ready
* to retire from the army,
* fishing by the river,

* What the hell are you
talking about retiring for?
* It is God's will that you
break your back in the sun.
* Shut the fuck up and work.
* Daddy, daddy.
* What's wrong?
* Daddy, I saw some guys over there.
* They had their faces covered.

* We can't see it from here.
* Try the other side.
* Perfect.
* Get up and keep looking.
* We heard that there's a bomb.
* that will explode
* just down the street.
* Auntie, did Walied speak to the Sheik?
* He told him about the
men planting the bomb
* and the Sheik told him to pray
to God and he will help us.
* We should not let the terrorists
control our lives
* and not be afraid and live normally.
* Yes, be strong and don't be afraid.
* But can we really live like that?
* So we're still going
to have the party?
* What else should we do?
* Yes, of course we will have the party.
* Yunis, don't drop your bread.
* Today we are happy
for his circumcision,
* God willing one day his wedding.
* Today his circumcision...
*...tomorrow his wedding...
*...and we will be happy for him.
* What's wrong with you?
There's nothing.
* Nothing.
* It was me.

This is the US Marines.
Not the fucking boyscouts.

(19th November, 5.45 am)
Or you can tell the bombers to stay.
? ? ?
- Good morning, sir.
- Ey, what's up Ramirez.
Is there any way I can speak
to you in private?
Yeah, sure.
Come over here.
Best privacy I guess.
What's up?
Sir, I have a question.
I'm kinda having difficulties
to sleep at night.
Well, what's bothering you?
Just bad dreams,
shit I've seen.
I was wondering...
Is there any way I
can speak to a doctor?
I'm sorry, but you can't see a doctor
until your tour of duty is over.
That's the way the policy is.
You're gonna have to wait until
your tour of duty is over
and see a doctor in your leave.
Ey, listen up, gents.
Everybody takes his food over
the ? ? ? checkpoint.
All right?
Let's go.

OoRah Marines.
OoRah, sir.
Gather round, I'm gonna say a
prayer for Pfc. Cuthbert.
Bow your heads.
Lord, we lost a great
young warrior today.
But the battle was won.
Please give his family the strength
to move on with their lives.
We know he is in a better
place with you, Lord.
Please give the United
States Marine corps
the courage and ability
to destroy our enemy,
who hides like cowards among
civilians.
We thank you Lord.
We have to make some pretty difficult
decisions sometimes out here.
But we know you understand.
Thank you,
and OoRah.
All right. OoRah Marines.
- OoRah!
- Outstanding job.
- Corporal Ramirez.
- Sir.
You handled yourself like a true
professional out there.
I wanna promote you to sergeant,
and I'm gonna recommend you
for the Bronze Star.
- Thanks sir.
- You kept your head in the game,
and you kept your Marines alive.
- Good to go?
- Yes sir. Thank you sir.
- All right. Job well done, Marine.
- Thank you, sir.
-All of you, great job.

* Mummy, mummy. Daddy's home.
* How are you?
* Good.
* I missed you.
(20th November)
- Ey man.
- Wat's up?
Have you been having nightmares lately?
Nightmares?
No, never.
It's like I cannot fucking sleep, man.
Like, last nightmare,
I kept hearing like cries and shit,
like,
I keep seeing these fucking bodies, man.
These fucking women
laid out fucking dead.
Their kids.
It's not so much the guys, man.
it's more like the women.
And then I see pictures
of like my fucking mother,
laying next to them and, like
I just wish I could fucking change
a lot of shit, man.
What are you talking about?
I feel like a lot of
those fucking people
I killed are fucking persons.
and you know me.
That I'm fucking living with this guilt
for the rest of my life, man.
No, I fucking don't
understand that either, man.
I feel like I'm personally responsible
for all those motherfuckers
that died underneath me.
Every Marine that died under--
underneath me.
I feel like I'm personally responsible,
like I could've fucking changed this,
do you know what I mean?
I fucking hate the motherfuckers,
the officers that sent us in.
Fucking hate 'em!
Ramirez, you all right?
Fucking hate 'em, man!
Everyone of them!
I fucking give a fuck about
the fucking medals, man!
They don't give a fuck about us.
* This is our time.
* Look at your children.
* Look at your families.
* We should get revenge
on the Americans.
* Enough orphans.
* We want our revenge.
* Give them mercy my God.
* Send them to heaven.
* Send them to heaven.
* Where is the world?
* Where are all the Arab countries?
* Look at us Arabs.
* Where is the help from the
European countries?
* Give us a sign.
* Find us a solution.
* We want our country back.
* We want back greater Iraq.
* The country of plenty.
* My name is Safa,
* I am the only survivor
of the Yunis family.
* My mum and dad and my 5 brothers
* and my auntie all got killed
by the Americans.
* I wish the Americans would be killed
* and they get out of Iraq.
* Now Safa,
* say the Americans
hit you over the head.
* Ok.
* This is a symbol of what
the Americans are doing,
* to our families and our people.
* Look at this girl, she's the only
survivor of her family.
* The Americans killed her whole family.
* What can we do?
* Will we just keep quiet?
* We are ready Sheik, we are ready!
* Bush, Bush.
* You cannot defeat us.
* Bush, Bush.
* You cannot defeat us.
* The Marines have lost
the battle for Haditha.
* Everyone has joined us.
* and we control the city.
* You will bring us victory.
* God willing.
* Victory by your hands.
*...Give us permission...
*...and see what we can do...
* Jafar, I'm afraid that once
the Americans leave
* we will get someone worse than Saddam
* and he will burn Iraq
more than it burns now.
They're going subway ? ? ? ?
It's the boss.
Do not engage the boss.
Roger.
Squib. Nobody is the ? ? ?
Direct Tango, direct Tango.
- ? ? ? building is to the boss.
- Roger that.
Major General, sir.
We ran a check on all the Iraqi dead
and none matches with
insurgents database.
Nothing that you say causes me any
undue concern...
It's a cleanly coordinated attack
and standard operating procedures
were followed.
This is the official press release
A U.S. Marine and 15 Iraqi civilians
were killed yesterday
from the blast of a...
roadside bomb in Haditha.
Iraqi Army soldiers and
Marines returned fire
killing eight insurgents
and wounding another.
(Four months later)
(Student footage
reveals Marine cover up)
The case first came to light when
a time magazin reporter received
video footage,
shot by a local Iraqi
journalism student.
It showed the gruesome aftermath
of the incident.
It also has interviews
with some of the survivors,
Safa Junis, 12 years old, is the only
living survivor from her family of 9.
She claims that the Marines came into
her house and shot her entire family.
Hiba Abdoolah and three children were
the only survivors of
a family of twelve.
If it had not been for
the Time Magazine report,
this case would never
have come to light.
The Marine high command failed to
investigate the events of November 19th
for over two months.
A blame, they say, must not be
allowed to stay at the enlisted level
but should be traced to its source,
which is the Secretary of Defense
and the Commander in Chief.
I am troubled by the
initial news stories, um...
I'm, uh,
mindful that there is a thorough
investigation going on.
If in fact the, uh...
you know...
laws were broken,
there'll be punishment.
One of the charged Marines,
a Corporal Ramirez,
according to his attourney
was nominated for a Bronze Star
for his heroism on the very
day that incident took place.
The Marines claim that they were
merely following their
standard operating procedures,
lost ? ? ? in extremely
hostile environment...
(Corporal Ramirez: Hero or Bad Guy? )
(8th March, 2006)
(Marine High Command, Camp Ramadi)
Sir.
Corporal Ramirez ? ? ? ? , sir.
At ease.
CPL Ramirez.
You're being investigated for
13 counts of murder.
CPL Delacruz,
Five counts of murder.
CPL Matthews,
three counts of murder.
and Sgt. Ross.
three counts of murder.
Now it is my job
and your job as Marines
to protect the reputation, the honor
and the future of this corps,
and I will not have a band
of reckless Marines
ruin that future and that reputation...
Holy shit.
Ey Matthews, check that fire out.
Ramirez!
Ramirez.
You ok?
We've all seen a lot of action
at a young age.
I'm 20 years old, and this is
my third tour of duty.
We've all seen things that will haunt us
for the rest of our lives.
And I guess after a while
you just get hardened.
You become numb.
