Okay, now, all you kids
got a release form.
You fill it out, you sign it,
then you hand it over when
you get your official entry numbers.
Only read it first.
You break a leg, we fix it.
You catch a cold,
there's free aspirin.
But acts of God, the management
is strictly not to be held to account.
Fire, flats, double pneumonia,
that's between you and Him.
So read it and then sign.
For the benefit of the first-timers,
we go around the clock,
and around
and around and around.
Ten-minute break
every two hours.
Rollo!
That's the warning signal.
If it's your partner,
you've got exactly 30 seconds
to get them moving again.
No excuses, no explanations.
Thirty seconds.
If it's two knees -- Rollo.
That's it, out.
O-U-T out.
We're gonna run it
as fair as human nature allows,
so when one of the judges rules,
that's it--no appeals.
When your partner is ruled out,
you can solo for 24 hours.
If you match up
with another solo, fair enough.
Otherwise, that's it -- out!
There'll always be a trainer
or a nurse on duty,
and a doctor out here
24 hours a day.
Okay?
Now, food.
Four regular meals
and three small ones each day.
Now!
What the hell's going on over there?
Sorry.
Kid, fill this out and get over there.
Come on, get over there.
There'll be two judges
on the floor at all times,
nurses and trainers
in the rest areas.
Any questions,
come up and ask them.
Fellas, give me a break.
In a couple of hours,
we fling open the magic doors
of fame and fortune,
so line up and get your number.
Yeah, we'll take care of that,
don't worry.
Where do you want these, Rocky?
They'll be here in a second.
Put them in there.
Turkey, check the rest areas.
Is this the first time
you've been in a contest?
Some system.
Just like the fleet.
Line up and wait, only longer.
Hey! How about
goosin' it up a little?
You'll get your turn.
Take it easy, huh?
What's this stuff? Hooch?
No, that's for my stomach.
I got a bad stomach.
- Paregoric, opium base.
- No number.
He's got another one.
It's medicine.
I gotta take it for my stomach.
So take it somewhere else. I got
enough trouble without a hophead.
You heard him,
school's over. Blow.
- That's no fair. Just because a guy's--
- Hire a lawyer.
Come on. Next.
Move it up.
Once, between hitches,
I worked a cattle boat out of Galveston.
Same thing,
you know what I mean?
No, I don't think I do, actually.
Well, what I mean is, if you think about it,
cattle ain't got it much worse than us.
They got it better.
There's always
somebody feeding them.
Sure. Stuffin' 'em up good
for the slaughter pen.
Right down the chute
and some big dumb bohunk
is standing there
with a sledgehammer.
But they don't know
it's gonna happen.
That puts 'em
one up on us, don't it?
Yeah, if you think of it that way.
What's the matter with him?
Nothing.
Have you got a specialty
of some kind?
I'm an actress.
Alice LeBlanc, from London.
You got an act or a bit?
Let's see a little.
Well, if you give us a few seconds,
we could work something up, okay?
Yes, they told me
you were fools,
but I was not to listen to your
fine words, nor trust your charity.
Jesus Christ.
You promised me my life,
but you lied!
You think that life is nothing
but not being stone dead!
Alice.
That's great, I really mean it.
Shakespeare, huh?
- It's from "St. Joan."
- Yeah, that's what I figured.
Maybe it's too highbrow,
but don't worry,
I'll set up something
just right for you.
Next!
Hey, Sailor.
Rocky, look at this.
Thirty-one?
Yeah, 31.
What do I need--
a note from my mother?
It's your feet, Sailor.
Next!
Move it. Move it.
Doc.
- You sick or something?
- It's all right.
Open up. Wider.
Wider.
What is this?
He's all right.
Bronchitis, maybe.
Yeah, maybe the Mongolian crud.
No dice.
You infect the whole place,
I got the health department on my back.
That's the way it is.
Next!
- I'm sorry, Gloria.
- That's a big help.
- You're the one that talked me into this.
- I'm sorry.
What about me?
- I'm sorry.
- That's what he said.
I can't buy coffee
and cigarettes with it.
I can't make exceptions.
- How many you got?
- 71 going through and I'm holding out...
What about her?
If she ain't pregnant, I'm Nelson Eddy.
So, what's healthier than having a kid?
And it gives the audience
something to root for.
What do you want me to do--
run out and get knocked up?
We could discuss it later.
That soap's a little hard.
- Is this our number?
- Just hold on a second.
- You got any other suggestions?
- Get yourself another partner.
Yeah, where?
Hey, cowboy!
Yeah, you!
Come here.
Good luck, Bates.
Keep the line moving.
Look, I was just out walking.
I didn't come to--
Is that a fact?
What's your name, cowboy?
Robert. Robert Siverton.
In a minute!
You got a partner, Richard?
No, I--It's Robert.
- I was just walkin'.
- There you are, miss.
How's he gonna dance in those things?
You mean boots?
They're not mine.
I room with another guy.
He went away and left them behind.
- He's gonna break an arch.
- Dig him up a pair of shoes.
Or maybe you'd rather wait
for the Prince of Wales.
- Have I got a choice?
- Yeah. Take it or leave it.
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!
Welcome to the dance of destiny,
ladies and gentlemen.
Around and around and around we go,
and we're only beginning, folks.
Only beginning!
On and on and on and on
and when will it stop?
When will it end?
When?
Only when the last two of these
wonderful, starry-eyed kids are left.
Only when the last two dancers
stagger and sway,
stumble and swoon, across the sea
of defeat and despair to victory.
One couple, and only one,
will waltz out of here,
over broken bodies
and broken dreams,
carrying the grand prize
of 1,500 silver dollars.
Mr. Lightman!
The clock of fate,
ladies and gentlemen.
I said "the prize"
because only one couple
will dance on
to fame and fortune.
Those who give up,
those who give out,
those who give in--out!
Tough rules,
but these are tough times.
In the words of our great leader,
Herbert Hoover,
"Prosperity is
just around the corner."
But what do we say
about the Depression?
That's what we say
about the Depression.
Come on,
let's hear it, folks!
Let's hear it!
It's walking dead night, Turkey.
Pour me a shot of water.
So pick your couple, folks.
Struggle with 'em,
hope with 'em, pray with 'em.
See if you can pick out that one lucky couple
and then cheer them on.
Come on, let 'em
hear you care, folks.
Let 'em know
you're with them all the way!
You hear that, kids?
You hear those wonderful folks
out there rooting for you?
Come on, kids,
show them you care.
A little... a little sprint for those
wonderful folks out there!
That's it.
You see 'em give, folks?
You see 'em give?
That's the spirit!
So why California?
You don't freeze
while you're starving.
It has the movies.
Are you an actress?
I done four atmosphere bits
since I've been here.
I'd have done more,
but I can't get into Central Casting.
They got it all sewed up.
Don't you know anyone
who can help you?
In this business?
How can you tell who can help you?
One day you're an electrician,
the next day you're a producer.
The only way I could get near a big shot
is to jump on the running board of his car.
God. Check that one.
Anyway, I don't know if the men stars can
help me as much as the women stars.
From what I've been seeing lately,
I think I've been letting
the wrong sex try to make me.
- You in movies, too?
- Sort of.
I was a dead French villager
in "Fallen Angels."
Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs!
Wasting your time, kiddo.
The only thing casting
is Von Sternberg's "Raw Earth."
Strictly an all peasant talkie.
I could play a peasant.
Not in that thing you couldn't.
- Do you like it?
- Does it matter?
Not so long as they do.
Hey, sweetie.
Got another partner, huh?
Only he don't look
much healthier than the last one.
What are you, a doctor?
He don't mean nothin', honey.
Just trying to be helpful.
Cod liver oil.
You oughta take some, maybe.
He's just steamin'
because you got 20 years on him.
Maybe more like 30.
That's where you got
your signals mixed up, sweetie.
Yeah, experience--
that's what counts.
Keep your eyes open, buster.
Pick up the beat
and try to stay with me, will ya?
Stop-time!
That's the kind of contestants
we've got for you, folks.
Very classy, Sailor.
You musta killed them in Roseland.
How about a big hand
for our very own ancient mariner?
Harry Klein!
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah.
Thank you, folks.
That's very generous.
You could all see that Harry
used to be in the U.S. Navy.
But something you can't see--
I'd like to be serious for a moment,
folks, if you'll permit me.
Harry Klein is one
of those brave young men
who sailed off to beat the Kaiser.
That's right,
a veteran of the Great War.
And let's hope
there'll never be another.
Harry was decorated in that war
for wounds received in action,
but that's not all.
I know Harry wouldn't want me
to tell you this,
but right now, at this moment,
there are 32 pieces of shrapnel
still embedded in Harry's body.
Thirty-two!
And here he is fighting another
kind of war and fighting to win.
Isn't that the kind of grit
and never-say-die spirit
that's made this a great country?
It is, isn't it?
You bet it is!
And I really mean that sincerely,
folks, from the bottom of my heart.
I should've learned
how to tap dance.
You okay?
Hope I don't start lugging' on ya.
You ain't never lugged on me.
Just keep thinkin' about the seven meals
a day they gonna be feeding us.
Can you feel that?
- What?
- The ocean.
The waves--you can feel them
right through the floor.
Even when you're far from it,
you can still feel it sometimes.
Not where I'm from.
- Where's that?
- Around.
Kansas.
Texas mostly--Dallas.
That must've been nice.
Nice?
Well, I've never actually been through there,
but that's the way
it always seemed to me.
You know, like you could look
just about anywhere and see land.
I mean,
with nothing set down on it.
Yeah, it's great.
I'm a real sucker for dirt and cactus.
That's how come I left.
Well, why did you leave?
You ever been to bed
with a Syrian who chewed tobacco?
Well, if anybody ever asks you,
tell 'em there's no future in it.
What do you want--
the whole floor?
I'm terribly sorry.
The way she's throwing it around,
her feet will last longer than her rear end.
He was a butcher.
- Who was?
- The Syrian.
Listen, I didn't mean to be personal.
I was just--
I didn't mean to be personal.
Yeah? Then why'd you ask?
Well...
just to make conversation.
We're gonna be stuck together
for a long time--
Don't strain anything for me.
All right.
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah.
This is Novelty Night.
We've got a husband and wife
dancing together.
Mr. and Mrs. Ora McCusick Mary
from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
There's a couple from Alaska.
Remember,
there's no place like Nome.
Don't forget to write
your poor old mother.
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah.
All right, kiddies, it's opening night.
Smile for the audience.
- What audience?
- We'll worry about that.
He could get you disqualified.
I've been disqualified by experts.
Ten minutes
and then they'll be back,
and the world's championship
marathon will go on and on
and on and on and on!
I got no time
for personal problems.
Just go find a bed.
Chances are you'll probably
never see the things again.
Laundry bag here,
towels and soap in there.
It's very simple.
Keep it in mind--
the laundry bag stays in here,
towels and soap
in that room only.
Excuse me, girls.
Miss LeBlanc, you got
that specialty bit down yet?
I'm memorizing it now.
Every line.
Swell. Come by my office next break.
Maybe we'll run through it.
Better get off your feet.
When's the baby due?
Don't know.
What'd the doctor say?
Well, see, James and me
been hitchin', ridin' in boxcars.
Nature's little miracle.
Christ.
- Why--
- What's the use of having a kid
unless you got enough dough
to take care of it?
You better get off your feet.
You only got another five minutes.
Folks can't stop having babies
'cause they don't got no money.
You intend to keep it?
I could never get...
Jimmy wants the baby.
Yeah. Why not drop
another sucker into this mess?
I told you guys,
no roughhousing.
And no grab-ass there,
college kid.
What's the matter there, boy?
This ain't for me.
I got sensitive feet.
Next time, I think
I'm gonna try flagpole sitting.
You guys are crazy.
That's really pitiful.
Man can't even make it
to the first rest period.
This here's
my eighth marathon already.
My wife and I even won one
in Oklahoma City one time.
We went 1,253 hours
of continuous motion.
First one of these, kid?
- How're you doing?
- I'm fine, doctor.
It ain't first cabin.
Hell, it ain't even steerage,
but it's better than nothin'.
Well, I figured I wasn't doing anything else
real important, so here I am.
You know what I'd do
if I was your age?
I'd join up all over again--the fleet.
No, I don't think I'd like that.
I'd like to be able to move on
if I got bored or something, you know?
Bumming?
That's all right for a while.
But a man's gotta belong somewhere.
You know, be part of something.
I mean, that's human nature, right?
I guess I never really thought about it much.
Yeah, well, you will.
When you get
to be my age, you will.
Not that I'm that old, you know.
It's the muscles up here that count, kid.
Even more so than your legs.
Right up in there.
No, you wait for Diane Nico,
she wait for you.
The petals of many flowers will fall,
but Diane Nico will wait forever.
Alice, that is terrible.
It just doesn't suit me.
I'll ask Mr. Graverto find
something else for us.
I think you'd better.
Hey, hot lips
Get that in Paris?
No. My mother made it for me.
Do you like it?
It's very nice.
Somebody said after the first hundred hours,
you start getting used to this.
What are you looking at?
There's a partially broken
window up there someplace.
I was trying to see
if it was light out yet.
- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- Yeah, I know.
Sometimes, down by the beach,
it gets light by 4:00.
It's like that in Hawaii,
because it's an island, you know.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. You can look right out
across the ocean to where the light is.
You can even stand in one spot
and watch the sun come up
on one side of the world
and go down on the other side.
How'd you get out there--Hawaii?
I've never been there, actually,
but you can imagine what it's like.
Yeah, you can imagine
you're Gary Cooper, too, I suppose.
I didn't mean that at all.
Why are you always trying
to start an argument?
All I meant was--
You tell that twist
to lay off of my wife.
She was at it again.
Every rest period, she's on her all the time
about why don't she have it cut out,
why don't she get rid of it.
She's giving Ruby the jumps.
I ain't having my wife
upset by no tramp like her.
- Go to hell, you big ape!
- You--
Don't.
- Boy, next time, I'm gonna--
- Knock it off!
You know the rules.
No fights on the floor.
What do you think this is--
a joint or something?
I'm keeping an eye on you.
Which one?
That was stupid. Did you see the face
on that corn pone? He coulda killed you.
Yeah, I guess.
Then why did you do it?
'Cause you're my partner.
How long we got left?
Wouldn't you know it?
I got the curse coming on.
Don't let them give you
any codeine. It'll pass you out.
Around and around and around.
Ninety-seven hours
of continuous motion.
And look at them, folks.
Still struggling, still hoping to win
the grand prize of 1,500 silver dollars
Let's give these wonderful
courageous kids a great big hand, huh, folks?
That's the spirit.
You wanna sleep some?
No, I'm too tired to sleep.
Sailor says you gotta go
a long time, maybe 500 hours,
before you can get so you can sleep
while you're still moving.
- You look tired
- No kidding.
Why don't you try sleeping
on my shoulder?
I won't let you slip.
You can trust me.
That's what the last guy said.
- What?
- Forget it.
Gloria?
She's there again.
She must live here.
You really ought to be nice to her.
Rollo told me she's trying
to get us a sponsor.
Nobody asked her to.
Look, it could mean four bucks a week,
clean socks, and new shoes.
Come on.
- I'm Mrs. Laydon.
- Yes, ma'am, we know.
One of the floor judges told us
you're trying to get us a sponsor.
That's 'cause
you're my favorite couple.
You're wearing my number--67.
That's the year I was born.
Really?
We're not supposed to stay
in one spot for too long.
I understand.
You go along.
But don't give up,
'cause you're going to win.
- I know you are.
- Thank you
You can't leave the floor.
I gotta eliminate you.
Don't bother.
Figure them two.
They'll never know
what they missed.
Why didn't you tell me
it was gonna be this tough?
You're holding your knees too tight.
It knots up the muscles.
Sixty-five.
I figured it out.
That's how old she is.
God, I hope I never live
to be that old.
That's not the way it happened.
It wasn't like that.
We were very close in a way.
I was her friend
Yowsah, yowsah!
Watch your feet, folks.
It's all part of the show.
Seven meals a day.
Seven--count 'em.
Believe me, these boys and girls
can really put it away.
- What's your name, my dear?
- Angie.
- How are you enjoying the food?
- Very good.
You hear that, folks?
After four days
of continuous dancing,
these boys and girls
may not be well-heeled,
but you can bet
they're well-stuffed.
Ten minute's time
is all they have to eat it in,
and they must keep moving,
they must keep dancing at all times.
- How are you doing, Sailor?
- I feel fine, the grub's good. I feel fine
The food is prepared in our own kitchens
by our own culinary experts,
at great expense
to the management,
but they believe that these
boys and girls should be well-fed.
Keep eating, kiddies.
Keep dancing.
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!
I have to.
Yeah...how are you gonna feed it
after you've got it?
Couple number 65,
in a scene direct from that
smash Broadway hit "Private Lives,"
our own Ramon Novarro
and Jean Harlow--
Mr. Joel Girard
and Miss Alice LeBlanc.
Did they like us?
Did they?
I hope so.
Do you think there's anyone in?
All the studio people.
Let's go look.
Alice and Joel will be
back with us again,
if there's no Hollywood talent scouts
in the audience tonight.
And now, in keeping with our policy
of letting you folks know everything
that happens in our little family here,
I am pleased to inform you
that another sponsor's come forward
to back still another pair
of our spunky kids.
Couple number 67,
Gloria Beatty and Robert Siverton!
Let 'em see the company
that's backed you to win, kids.
Congratulations, kids.
Congratulations.
And who knows, folks?
With a sponsor like that,
they may just win.
Suppose we did win.
What would you do with it?
- What? With what?
- The money.
Maybe I'd buy
some good rat poison.
What the hell is it?
It's two hours.
You told me to get you up
in two hours, Rocky.
Shake me out a butt, Turkey.
Listen to 'em...
Those wonderful, wonderful people.
Yowsah.
Shut it.
Shut the goddamn door.
Wonderful.
You gotta understand them is all.
You know something, Turkey?
My old man never got out
of the fourth grade.
When it came to people...
...he didn't know his ass from his elbow.
You know what he was?
He was a faith healer.
I used to travel his circuit with him.
I was the one he healed.
I was his shill
to get the crowd set up.
"Walk, my boy."
"When I lay my hand on you,
you will walk."
"You will walk."
Sodden old bastard!
He thought it was him
they believed in, but it was me.
Here's a guy whose fingers
stretched over 13 notes.
What are you doin' here?
It's a rest period.
You're supposed to be
off your feet.
I was just looking at the sunset.
Go on, get off your feet.
Okay.
Sunset.
Matron?
Someone?
It is gone.
Matron!
- What is it?
- It's gone.
- It's gone!
- What's gone?
My dress!
It's right in front of you
No, my other one.
My pink one.
I--
And chemicals for my hair.
My rouge!
And my lipstick!
Everything is gone!
Somebody's taken it
out of my bag!
Nobody's taken anything.
It's probably just slipped under here.
No. They did it!
One of them did it.
- One of them stole my things!
- You stop!
- Stop it right now.
- Give it!
- Give it back to me!
- You heard it.
You know what that means.
What the hell's going on here?
You heard the sirens. Come on!
Hurry up and get out there!
My dress.
I had it in my case--
- Is she squirrelly?
- I don't think so.
- My pink satin one.
- You better shake it up.
- You got a couple of seconds left.
- I only have two dresses.
Later! Just hustle
your fanny out there
Nobody wants your dress.
Please wait.
Please wait.
Why don't you wear
your other one?
Please wait.
- What?
- Nothing.
What are they doing it for?
It's not for fun.
You can bet on that.
Christ. Here it comes.
I can't.
Jimmy, I don't think I can.
Yeah, you can, honey.
Just don't start thinking about it now.
Son of a bitch.
The thing to remember, kids, is this is
the kind of stunt that packs 'em in.
Listen, we'll even get some
of the Hollywood crowd out there tonight.
Get one of those uniforms
they're passing out
and make sure
you tie your numbers on.
Number 63, easy on the goods.
Listen, kids, these track outfits are
being rented for one time, and one time only,
so any rips, tears, or malicious damage,
you get charged, okay?
We don't have enough
uniforms to go around,
so the rest of you will wear
sweat suits, but they're very nice.
We'll have the doctor
and the nurses on the floor,
so no one has to worry.
Now, you kids who are pros
already know how it works
I'm sure the rest of you
have all heard about it.
And now--now you're going to see it!
Yowsah! The derby!
The supreme--the supreme test
of energy and endurance.
Ten solid, wrenching minutes
of rack and ruin--the derby!
Good! Good, good, good, good.
Because you're in
for an exciting extravaganza.
Yowsah, the derby.
And, if I may be permitted
to share a thought with you,
there's a lesson for all of us
in this, ladies and gents
Contestants,
if you hear me back there...
...you don't need
to be number one
as you amble down
life's highway....
but don't be last!
Round and round and round
they'll go for ten little minutes.
Who will set the pace?
Who will win the race?
Everybody excepting
the last three couples!
- Let's go!
-And now, here they are!
And lookyy, looky, looky, folks.
They've got knees!
They've got knees!
Everybody here?
Okay, take a good look!
Get your hankies ready, folks,
because three couples
are about to go bye-bye.
Yes, indeed.
Nurses and house physician,
are you ready?
Audience, are you ready?
All right! Bring it in!
Mr. Rhythm!
Yes. Yes, indeed, they are off,
ladies and gentlemen
Everyone wins in this race,
except the last three couples.
The supreme test
of energy and endurance.
If one goes down,
they have ten seconds,
and ten seconds only, to getup.
And they must heel-and-toe.
Hold your hats, folks.
Here come the leaders.
Four judges, keep your eyes
on the last three couples,
because the last
three couples will lose
Oh, nelly!
There's a pileup.
There's a pileup
in the far corner!
One! Two! Three!
Four! Five! Six!
Seven! Eight! Nine!
How about that, folks?
Exciting? Well, I hope to tell you.
You all right?
Keep going!
Come on. Come on.
The management cautions
that no wagering is permitted,
but you can always cheer on
your favorite couple,
and believe me,
these wonderful kids deserve your cheers,
because each one of them
is fighting down pain, exhaustion,
weariness,
struggling to keep going,
battling to win,
and isn't that the American way?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just been informed
that among our celebrity guest list
for tonight is Mr. Mervyn LeRoy!
You hear that? LeRoy.
Who's LeRoy?
Only the best director
in Hollywood!
How about it, Mr. LeRoy?
Almost as much excitement here
as in "Little Caesar", right?
Heel-and-toe, Sailor, or she's out!
Come on, we're almost there
There's trouble right here, folks.
The boy from couple
number 78 is in trouble.
Get a floor judge over there.
- One! Two!
- Get up!
No, stop it!
No! Get up!
Three! Four!
Five! Six!
No! No! No!
- Eight! Nine! Ten!
- Stop it!
Out! Get him out!
Couple number 78 is out!
Out of the world's championship
monster marathon!
But that's life!
Let's give them a big hand!
Are you all right?
- Are we behind?
- I don't know.
Less than two minutes left,
ladies and gentlemen!
- Go! Keep going!
- Only two minutes.
What's the matter?
Couple number 67
is in trouble, folks.
No fooling, they're in trouble!
The boy from 67 is down!
He is definitely down!
- What is it?
- My leg.
Stretch your leg out and move it!
One!
- Shake your leg!
- Two!
Three!
- Four!
- Straighten your leg.
Five!
Help me!
Six! Seven!
Shut up, goddamn it!
He's getting up!
- I'm up!
- Hang on to me.
The guy from couple 67 is up!
But will they make it?
They've lost ground
Forty seconds left.
Will they make it?
Hold on to me!
That was the greatest.
You've got real guts. I mean it.
- Save your breath!
- I hope you make it, baby.
Thirty seconds!
Twenty seconds!
Ten seconds!
Five seconds!
The losers are
couple number 22,
28, and 37.
We weren't last.
It's okay.
I know it's
a sad moment for all of us,
but those are the rules,
ladies and gentlemen
But after 602 hours,
25 days of continuous dancing,
I think that these kids
deserve a big hand!
Have you heard anything yet,
Mr. Graver?
Don't worry about it, Alice.
I've reported it to the authorities.
We should hear something soon.
It can't just have disappeared.
I mean, somebody must've taken it.
It's not just my dress.
It's my makeup and everything.
I have nothing else.
