You'll feel better now
What am I going to do?
Tommaso Garani, room 103
My 'phone is out of order.
I wonder if you could...
Could you tell the operator?
He's awake, but drugged with morphine
- Will you operate?
- No, it would be futile
Tommaso, are we disturbing you?
Come in, my dears
Operation successful, but
the patient died
Sit down
I see there's a party to
launch your book today
- Let's not talk about it
- Why not?
Your book is the one thing
that really matters
Lidia, why don't you sit down?
Smoke if you like
I don't feel tired
Here's the magazine with
your article on Adorno
What's your opinion? Shall I
include it in my book?
Yes, it's very good.
Your book will be excellent
I'll have to give it more thought
I haven't been able to think
these last few days...
...yet this is my first free time
in years
What an ironical holiday
Lidia, you look wonderful
- I told Marcella not to come
- Quite right
I'd rather not see anyone
I'm sick and tired of all the pretending
But I was hoping you would come,
of course
You know, I see things
in a clearer light now
I regret that my presence spoiled
so many evenings...
...in your delightful home
It's your home, too, you know
You appreciate many things
when you're all alone
You realize that so much
remains to be done
I wonder if I've ever done
anything really useful
I lacked the courage to probe deeply
Probably I never had enough
intelligence, anyway
If that's true, I'd better
pack up writing at once
You're joking
Occasional self-criticism
helps to raise morale
You bought it? I was going to
bring you a copy
I've not only bought it,
I've begun to read it
Fifty pages so far
I hope I'll finish it
The bath episode is exceptional
Unless morphine has warped my
judgement, it's your best
With morphine things seem different
It must be the morphine.
Do you really like the book?
I do
You'll end up a great success
Yes, I'll come to a bad end
The advantage of premature death:
you escape success
My mother
How are you, Tommaso?
Poor Mother, seven hours on a train
just to sit here
This is Saturday, isn't it?
Who have you seen lately?
Hardly anyone. We haven't done much
lately
We don't get out much,
except to drive around
What about your trip to Greece?
- We haven't decided
- Get well; it was your idea
Don't treat me as a patient;
I know how this will end
Sorry
My publisher will dispose of my
royalties. This must be paid for
It's nothing... I'm sorry...
Don't tire yourself. Should we go?
No, please stay
Quite a place, isn't it?
Appalling style, but I never expected
to end in such luxury
I feel a bit of a fraud
Hospitals are getting more like
night clubs
People want a good time to the end
You know, in such cases one craves
champagne
I don't like it, but I've developed
a passion for it
They weren't surprised
It's stimulating; it's good for you
Excuse me, I've never dared to
ask your name
My name is Elena
Will you have a drink with us?
No, thank you. Don't tire yourself
with talking
She's not a nurse; just a beauty
to boost morale
Yet beauty is depressing
in certain circumstances
Giovanni, will you pour?
Only for me? What about Lidia?
No, thanks, Tommaso. I'd rather not
Giovanni, don't let me drink alone.
You, too, mother
I have to go, Tommaso.
You stay, Giovanni
I have to go. I'll come again
tomorrow
- Don't you want to go, too?
- I'll stay a little longer
Goodbye. See you soon. Tomorrow
They are my only real friends, mother;
others are just acquaintances
They're good people. Giovanni's
a writer, famous, too
If they ever visit you one day...
You must go there
...give them the room overlooking
the orchard
If that's your wish, I promise we'll go
I think they are using water,
not morphine
- How was that concert?
- I didn't go
Have you a match?
No, a match
Get up, please
I could do without this book party
- Are you too tired to go?
- No, I'm fine
Well, a little tired, perhaps
I must tell you something unpleasant
Must you?
Yes. It happened at the hospital.
Very unpleasant
I saw that girl again
- Which girl?
- The one in the corridor
At first I couldn't make out
what she wanted
You went into her room
She was like a wild animal.
I was carried away
Why was it "unpleasant"?
It was hideous. At first I thought
I'd provoked it. The nurses came in
Good story material. Call it
"The Living and the Dead"
- Is that your only comment?
- What else?
That you did something vile?
You disgust me?
No, I understand. You were taken
by surprise. Let's forget it
Perhaps she's the lucky one
Why?
She's uncontrollable
This is the ante-room of fame;
we all wait here
Please sign a copy for
our Nobel Prize winner
I see you sign on the left
- Do you prefer the left?
- Probably
Very interesting; you could have
a great future
- Now one for my collection
- For you: "In friendship"
- What are you writing now?
- Nothing
How I'd love to write a book
- Going away this weekend?
- No, I'm too busy
We'll talk later. Regards to Lidia
Isn't my wife back?
Hasn't she 'phoned?
- Shall I serve dinner?
- No, you can go. I'll wait
Wait here
Stop it! Stop it!
Wait
Do you still want me to wait?
The wind's strong up there
- Have you seen Lidia?
- No, I thought you were out
I'm fed up. Paolo has a cold;
we can't leave town
Ask Lidia to call round
She's not at home. I thought
she might be with you
No, I haven't seen her for days
It's you. Where are you?
I'm in Sesto San Giovanni
In the same old field...
...kids are still firing rockets;
you'll like it
They shoot up ever so high
No, don't worry. Nothing's wrong
Nothing, I tell you
Come and pick me up, will you? Hurry
If you're meeting someone, there's
a little hotel nearby
Why come here?
I just happened to come this way
It hasn't changed at all
It will before long
They were over there,
the boys with rockets
This line was in use when we lived here
Why have you moved the sponge?
I'm tired of staying in
- Let's go to that party
- Anywhere to get out
- Why did they invite us?
- Gherardini has a reason
- Will there be many guests?
- I suppose so
Millionaires collect intellectuals;
he's picked you
A new dress?
Let's not go to Gherardini's party
I'd rather we went somewhere
by ourselves
If you like
What's up?
- Watching you amuses me
- What's so amusing?
I don't know. Sometimes you seem
to present a front to me
Nonsense. Look at her; she's not bad
Remember?
You're really trying to
distract my attention
Don't belittle me always.
I can have my own thoughts
What now?
I haven't a thought now...
but I'm expecting one
I can feel it coming
Here
Did the thought come?
Is it a nice thought? Tell me
Why not?
Where's Gherardini's villa?
In Brianza; about half an hour's drive
Life would be tolerably agreeable
if it were not for its amusements
An inspiration?
I no longer have inspirations,
only recollections
Won't you tell me your thought?
Later. Well, shall we go to
the Gherardinis?
Why have you changed your mind?
I don't know; one must do something
- Are they all dead?
- Let's hope so
Who here would read
"The Sleepwalkers"?
Pontano, isn't it? So nice of you to
come. I've heard so much about you
We're celebrating the horse's
first victory
My daughter's horse
- What's his name?
- Volfango. He's so good
From your books I expected you to be
old and grey
You've read them?
Do I look too inane?
Come, I'll introduce you
Let us introduce ourselves
as we meet people
Hello, Berenice
Lidia and I have hated each other
from the cradle
Pontano, we meet at last
Antonio, put him to bed
- No, he's so sweet
- Not if he doesn't sleep
But it's his party, after all
Put him to bed. This lot will
teach him bad habits
Don't stare so; I know I show signs
of wear and tear
You've improved a lot, you know
You were so plain. Shouldn't I
have said that?
I've heard it many times
You behave like a tart
Are you married?
I live all alone. I was born to be alone
I'm too sensitive - as my dentist
used to say
Do you still hang around
with intellectuals?
I never see you anywhere
We don't go out much.
Tonight is an exception
How beautiful the pool looks
Remember Grimaldi? I still see her
Please... let's forget the past
There are three thousand roses here;
what a hue they take on at night
- Do roses sleep?
- Yes, all night long
Isn't that a beauty? It just awoke
Tell Filippo to arrange them;
everyone else makes them look funereal
Look who's arrived
- Haven't we met before?
- Yes, but I can't place it
Aren't you enjoying yourself?
- Should I jump into the pool?
- Naked or dressed?
I've heard so many good things
about you
- Who designed this place?
- Vietti
Cesarino! Show this gentleman around
I'm going to Sweden.
On my boat, of course
He's awfully rich; he owes millions
Roberto's just arrived.
Shall I introduce you?
He's a remarkable man.
I'll go and get him
Stop sending me postcards;
I'm green with envy
- I've only just got back
- From your holiday?
- It was a business trip
- I bet!
Why, Marchesa Gentili, from Rome
This lady does so much for orphanages,
Signor Pontano
I will have one. Everyone smokes
here in Milan
Signorina Resy. Please join us
Giovanni Pontano? The author
of that great book?
One of the best books ever written
I adore it, I really do. I'm your
greatest admirer in Italy
You must allow me that privilege
I'd like a novel about a woman
who loves a man...
...but the man doesn't love her
But he does admire her intelligence,
her character
They live together... but how could
such a story end?
In so many ways
She'd have to be strong
and sacrifice herself
She sacrifices herself for
another woman's happiness
Why does she sacrifice herself?
I don't know. It makes me want to cry
What are you doing here?
Why not mix with the others?
Yes, I will in a moment
Do you find it interesting here?
So-so. Why is it you never seem
to enjoy yourself?
I am enjoying myself
There's a girl in there enjoying
herself alone, too
She's the one reading
"The Sleepwalkers"
She's pretty, too
- Everything all right, Pontano?
- I'm afraid I know no one
It's absurd to condemn wealth.
No one's wealthy now
But if anyone is still thinking of
becoming rich...
...my advice is: don't let money
obsess you
I've always looked upon my businesses
as works of art
Their financial profit was
almost immaterial
The important thing is to create
something lasting
But not everyone can create
something lasting
The thing that sustains a writer,
like you, Pontano...
...is a sense of necessity,
not a need for profit
You write because it's necessary
for you and others
- But one has to live
- I never worried about that
Life is what you make of it
with your own resources
What would you do if you
couldn't write?
I think he'd commit suicide
I don't feel that important
Perhaps there are other ways
Isn't writing an irrepressible
but antiquated instinct?
A lonely craftsman putting
one word after another
The job can't be mechanized
Do you believe all that?
No. But you have the advantage
of real people...
...you create real houses, real cities
The rhythm of life, the future,
is in your hands
This is a black day for my husband
You're right
Are you one of the many
worrying about the future?
I'm building my own, although
the present keeps me busy
Probably the future will never come
The future will be awful,
don't you think?
By the way, why not stay here tonight?
Darling, you're always interrupting me
Carry on. You were saying the future
may never come
Who knows what the future holds?
Our privileges will vanish.
A good thing, too
When I was young I imagined
a world like this...
...and set out to create such a future
Would you like a drink?
He's been staring at that statue
all night
Who knows what the animal is thinking?
Maybe he expects it to wake up
Cats are strange
Go away, Resy. Leave me alone
Can't you find someone
to play with me?
- Won't I do?
- No. Too old
- I'll be younger if I play with you
- I don't want that
I'd have won. The compact
must stop on the last row
What's the prize?
You make a wish and tell it
if you win
My name is Valentina
Do you often lose this game?
I've just invented it
- Once I lost everything
- What game was that?
The first with seven points
is the winner
Frankly, I came here to talk to you
Too ruthless
I'm scared
That was not ruthless enough
One for me
One of the stones has fallen out
It can't have gone far, can it?
Maybe it rolled into the garden
Never mind, it was only a ruby
Do you enjoy acting the cynic?
Fifteen thousand on Valentina
Twenty thousand on Pontano
- Sixty thousand on Pontano
- Come, now, you can't be serious
You only worry about losers
A typical intellectual.
Egoistic, but compassionate
This isn't a racetrack and don't
take me for a horse
Is there a friskier horse?
I wish to enquire about Signor Garani.
Room 103
When?
Ten minutes ago?
Was his mother with him?
I'm rather disappointed
In me?
How can I put that right?
Shall we read a few pages together?
That would be one way of
becoming closer
- Are you craving affection?
- Aren't you?
I withdrew from the game;
you must claim your prize
Let me savour it a little longer
But don't forget
My memory seems to get worse
every day
Good night, Daddy
I'd like a word
Pontano, I've got a proposition for you.
I could use a man like you
I'm running a cultural programme
for my employees
I want better contact between
workers and management
You know why?
They don't know the firm's history
and my part in it
I want a press and public relations
department...
...with a special section...
...devoted to internal relations
- I want our company's history written
- By me?
Yes, but as an executive
- A full-time job?
- That's right
Wouldn't you like an executive position?
May I ask what you earn?
Your wife's family is rich, I believe
True, but I have my own money, and
I contribute to many publications
Wouldn't you like to be independent?
In what way?
Think it over. It's our policy
to pay top salaries
Look what my cousin brought me
from America
A wallet, with a dollar inside
You see, the dollar gets everywhere
All alone, Signora Pontano?
Isn't it beautiful here?
- Where are you going?
- I won't be long
Have you seen Signorina Gherardini?
Shall we dance?
You can't dance
Don't play about
Where are we going?
Wait a moment. Let's talk.
Tell me something
I'll tell you a bedtime story later
Pretend I'm in bed
No, later. I'll tell you about a
hermit - intellectual, of course
He drank only dew, until
he came to the city...
...tasted wine and become an
alcoholic. How's that?
I'd like a true story about you
- Worse has happened to me
- I wish I could understand a writer
- I've forgotten your name
- Friends call me Resy
- You want to understand writers only?
- No, others, too
I think you'll have your hands full
I'm sorry, I can't
At least I'm clever enough
not to break up a marriage
Now spend the rest of the evening
with your wife
But it was she who sent me to you
Never mind. It's my prize of your game
It's so dark. How can I find her?
I felt miserable this evening...
...but our game cheered me up
Now the misery is creeping back,
like a melancholy dog
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No, I smoke cigars
I'll get my own
Bring more candles
I think we still have
some things to say
Of course
I think that love restricts a person
It creates misunderstanding all around
But not within. Even novels are
sentimental now
I see; you're gathering material tonight
The way I feel, I don't know
if I'll ever write again
I know what to write,
but not how to write it
It's called a crisis; very common
among writers today
But in my case it's affecting
my whole life
You're just weak, like me
Why tell me? I may not understand
My hobbies are golf, tennis...
...cars and parties
Is that all in life? Don't you like
other things, too?
Yes. Everything
Promise not to make fun of me?
I heard snatches of television
dialogue:
"Stop that car!"
"I wouldn't do that, Jim"
After that, the howling of a dog...
...rising effortlessly,
in perfect misery
Then I thought I heard a 'plane
Then silence... and I was happy
A garden's silence is made of sounds;
press your ear to a tree and listen
The sounds may be within us;
I'd rather think it's the tree
The silence is broken by
an alien noise...
...disturbing my peace
I close the window, but the noise
persists; it's too much for me
I don't want useless sounds;
I want to select them
Voices and words... there are so many
words I'd rather not hear...
...but you must resign yourself, like
floating on the waves of the sea
May I hear it again?
I've erased it. It was drivel.
I don't take my writing very seriously
Mother says scribbling indoors
ruins the complexion
It's a sin to waste such intelligence
I'm not intelligent; I'm alert
I'm happy to observe things
without having to write
I went to the States to see Julia
- Who's Julia?
- A hurricane
We may meet more often, Valentina.
Your father has offered me a job
Last year I thought I was
in love with a boy...
Something must be wrong with me,
but it will pass
Whenever I try to communicate...
love disappears
Was that when you lost everything?
Why work for my father?
Surely you don't need money
No?
What you need is a girl,
for a fresh start
Not a girl
You
- Don't be afraid
- I'm not
You see? It's ridiculous
How can he sleep? Anything might
happen
- Nothing ever happens
- Yes, but I hate seeing time wasted
You'll give me a heart attack
Come to my room and dry yourself
How prosaic. Sandwiches at this hour
d'Annunzio's turtle died of colic
after eating flowers
It's true, but you don't believe me
I'll get a towel
You should take your dress off
Listen, Valentina... isn't that
your name?
Stop fussing over me; tell me
what you have in mind?
Please don't spare my feelings
I'm sure that's not in your nature
I've nothing in mind. Dry yourself or
stay wet, but don't go on about it
Isn't our writer drinking?
One day, in Venice...
...I was dining with that
American author...
- The one who hunts elephants
- Hemingway?
There's a man for you. A real artist
I said to him: "Dear Hemingway,
I like you
"One of these days I'll visit you
in Cuba"
Do you know what he replied?
"If you do, I'll shoot you"
There's a man who knows his business
Earns what he likes.
Millions of dollars
Even an intellectual can't scorn that
It's hard to say what an intellectual
might scorn
My boy, never despise money
Our time, sir...
...is vile and anti-philosophical,
afraid to take a stand on values
As for democracy, in a nutshell,
it means: take things as they come
I respect that quotation,
but it's offensive here
He spoke it complacently,
but in despair
It's the words that count,
not the author's intentions
- Shall I tell you what happened?
- Skip it
Fine. I'm not much good at confessions
I wonder what I am good at?
Not a love, it escapes me
I've plenty of vices,
but I hardly practise them
I don't even like whisky
I think I've found the vice that
suits me; it's warm and good
How old are you?
Eighteen... plus many, many months
You don't know what it is to feel
the weight of years, in vain
I just feel like dying
An end to this agony, something new
- It may be nothing
- Yes, it may be nothing
Let's go
I don't feel a bit jealous,
in spite of what I said
Not a bit
That's the trouble
I hope we'll see you again
- Perhaps you'll invite me over?
- In September, after your holiday
This year I won't be back until later...
much later
You've exhausted me, the pair of you
Shall we go this way?
Take no notice. I'm just crying
because I'm silly
Let's not go home just yet
Want to hear a good one?
Gherardini offered me a job
- Will you accept it?
- I don't think so
Why not? It's a good opportunity.
Your life would be your own at last
I 'phoned the clinic. Tommaso is dead
When? Why didn't you tell me?
You were playing. Was he really
your good friend?
He was much more to me
He convinced me, despite myself,
that I was more clever than I am
He spent days trying to make me study...
...even though I wasn't interested;
I was concerned with my problems
His persistence nearly drove me mad
I began to hate him for it
He never talked about himself.
Only me... me...
And I never understood
I thought so little of myself
When we're young, we're so stupid, we
can't imagine things coming to an end
You talked only about yourself
That was something new for me,
I was so happy with it...
...that nothing in the world
was more beautiful
Because I loved you. You, not him
That's why his affection irritated me
and flattered you
Isn't that true?
Yes, but not much.
He was so vulnerable.
I feel like dying because
I no longer love you
That's why I'm desperate
I wish I were old, my life's
dedication to you over
I wish I no longer existed,
because I can't love you
That's the thought which came to me...
...in the night club,
when you were so bored
But if this is true,
if you feel like dying...
...it means you still love me
No, it's only pity
I never gave you anything.
I was completely unaware
I go on wasting my life, like a fool...
...taking without giving,
or giving too little
If you mean I haven't much to give,
you may be right
I used to spend afternoons
reading in bed
Tommaso would call and find me there
He could have taken me; I wouldn't
have resisted, out of boredom
But he was satisfied to watch me
as I read
All those purposeless books
Two hundred pages a day;
I read so quickly
I've been selfish
Now I realize that what we give others
comes back to us
Do they think their music
will improve the day?
Lidia, let's settle this
Let's try to hang on to something
we're sure of
I love you
I'm sure I'm still in love with you.
What more can I say? Let's go home
When I awoke this morning
you were still asleep
As I awoke I heard
your gentle breathing
I saw your closed eyes,
beneath wisps of stray hair...
...and I was deeply moved
I wanted to cry out, to wake you,
but you slept so deeply, so soundly
In the half light your skin
glowed with life...
...so warm and sweet I wanted to kiss
it, but I was afraid to wake you
I was afraid of you awake
in my arms again
Instead, I wanted something no one
could take from me, mine alone...
...this eternal image of you
Beyond your face I saw
a pure, beautiful vision...
...showing us in the perspective
of my whole life...
...all the years to come,
even all the years past
That was the most miraculous thing:
to feel, for the first time,
that you had always been mine
That this night would go on
for ever...
...united with your warmth,
your thought, your will
At that moment I realized
how much I loved you, Lidia
I wept with the intensity of
the emotion
For I felt that this must never
end...
...we would remain like this
all our lives...
...not only close, but
belonging to each other...
...in a way that nothing could
ever destroy...
...except the apathy of habit,
the only threat
Then you wakened and, smiling, put
your arms around me, kissed me...
...and I felt there was nothing
to fear
We would always be as we were
of that moment...
...bound by stronger ties
than time and habit
Who wrote that?
You did
No... I don't love you any more
You don't love me, either
Say it
No, I won't say it
