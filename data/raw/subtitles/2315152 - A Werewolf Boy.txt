What the monster is this?
Why do you watch TV during a meal?
It’s so loud.
I am just listening
Did Eun-Joo call?
She called yesterday. Are you fine and…
I want to see you or something.
Why she didn’t speak me directly?
When you call from Korea, it is night here.
And she has become strange recently.
Maybe she has a boyfriend.
What?
In Korea?
She needs some discipline, really.
Oh my, how can you say such things?
Oh my, how can you say such things?
She’s nineteen, so it’s absolutely normal
Well, even fourteen-year olds are kissing
and hugging on a street.
Well, even fourteen-year olds are kissing
and hugging on a street.
Hello
[Hell…Oh, excuse me?]
Yeah
[Is it Mrs. Kim’s house?]
Yeah.
[Can I speak with...]
Sure. Hold on.
Mom, there is phone call from Korea.
It’s Eun-Gee!
Hi, Eun-Joo~
[Eeh, are you Mrs. Kim Soon Eee?]
Yes, I am.
(TV off)
Ok. I understand.
Who is it?
What happened?
...
I must go to Korea.
Granny~!
So I get C on the midterm exam.
I thought he would teach well.
You know, professors don’t speak Korean actually.
Endless repetition is our only hope.
Endless repetition is our only hope.
[Hello?]
Mo…Mommy?
[Did you met her?]
I am on the way with granny
[Where are you?]
Kang-Won-Do…Hwa-Chun-Gun…
[Where is there?]
/-Do…
Gae..
Gae..
[I want to talk to grandma.]
/Do, Gae..
Ok. Hold on
Grandma?
Yeah. It’s me
Yeah, everything is fine,
I had a meal and took medicine as follows
[Why have you gone there instead of sending Eun-Joo alone?]
I said, everything is ok
[Mom, he wants you to come back soon.]
Granny
Is it here you used to live?
Uh huh
For a while
This place is so scary
It seems like…monster would appear
Monster, you say?
At that time, it seemed exactly same
It felt like monster would come out
How old were you then?
When I was like you.
When I was beautiful like you.
At that time…
Quiet!!
Oh, I’m so sorry.
We are making so much trouble to you
Ohoho! I am fine.
Thank you very much!
Ah, ok ok~
Really thank you!
Kim-Soon-Eee! Step aside
Oh, so you are a younger sister?
Soon-Eee! Put it down! Take a rest.
I’m okay
Oh my Gosh! Oh my Gosh! Granny, that’s so heavy…
Helping new come neighbor is natural!
Together, everything becomes easy
Hey! Dong-Seok! You will fall! It breaks!
Don’t run, Dong-Mi!
Hey~ This house is so nice!
Hey! Hey!
Please, somebody hold it
I will. Just leave him
Okay…
So? Air is nice, isn’t it?
The house is quite good
There is my father’s summer house in the vicinity
But…the wall was so high and it looked gloomy
Therefore I tore down it
Oh, Thanks
I am so thankful to Jee-Tae…
Just don’t say it
Just leave it, what’s wrong?
It’s a pig bladder
Had it not been for your help,
we would have carried baggage all day
It’s a pleasure
Help yourself
Okay, Okay
Thank you very much
Soon-Eee, Soon-Ja, have you thanked?
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Dong-Seok, Dong-Mi,
have you said “I gratefully receive?”
-We gratefully receive!
-We gratefully receive!
Oh Grandma, they have been eating already
By the way, where is your husband?
He died last year
Aha..
Now I’m marking up a manuscript at home and raising children…
Aha…
By the way, I’d like to introduce myself to villagers during a meal…
This is all
Our family and Dong Seok’s grandma
There is Jeong-Sook who is renting our house,
But I haven’t seen her for a while
By the way, I have lived more than 5 years in this village,
But it’s the first time I have come in
How many rooms are there?
Oh my, there is even telephone
Does somebody lived here before?
lol
My goodness….
Of course, there was someone…
I still don’t know his profession,
He had never gone out,
I couldn’t speak to him normally.
Then…
Ah…Hey…
One more soup please
Then he died due to heart attack~
Even before then, I haven’t seen him for a long time
He used to keep wolves, next to that barn
He used to keep wolves, next to that barn
Wow
Huh…Why he…
For food?
No…He studied something…
Walked up and down with big books
Oh, by the way, the children are so pretty!
But the school is quite far from here
So you are...uhm…elementary school student,
And older sister is…eeh…
Maybe you will attend High School, right?
Soon-Eee doesn’t attend a school
Oh my gosh…
We hope you enjoy the food we’ve prepared
How does it taste?
There is plenty of food, so eat more
Mom, I left something on the yard…
It’s cold, so come back quickly!
By the way, we…
Actually we cannot afford such a big house, 
but moved into because of Soon-Eee’s illness
Doctor said she needs home treatment.
What, where?
Her lung…has a problem
So she is preparing qualification exam at home
I haven’t seen my daughter’s smile for a long time
My sister has no friend at all
Soon-Ja…
I feel so sorry
Her face is white as a sheet
What matter!
I didn’t even come close to school, too!
Wait a minute, who is that man with greased hair?
He is the son of my husband’s business partner
So, he is not living here?
Yes
I see…
He looked like a spoiled man
He was sticking his hands in pockets while the elders working…
Why is he here?
He bought this house
There is only two families on entire village
But villagers seems so nice
Maybe we should open windows
Weather is cold, but it will be warmer as the boiler is stoked
Did you take medicine?
I just took it
What about smell?
Strange
Is there a lot of dust?
Yeah…
I will clean here tomorrow, so don’t worry.
Everything will be ok.
Go to sleep
Yeah, I guess so. Ouch, I’m so tired.
“Moonlight, Sorrow”
“Dark shadow inside me.
My existence is meaningless.
Rot and decay.
Die, my soul!!!"
Hey Soon-Ja, wake up!
There is something outside the house! Wake up!
Wake up, I say!
Mommy! Sister is bullying me!
Oh my, Soon-Eee!
Soon-Eee, what’s wrong?
What sound is this? Huh?
Where is your sister?
Mom! Is it here?
Oh my, what is happening here?
You should’ve waked me up.
What, why are you here?
Oh my gosh
Why are you alone? Are you hurt?
Where? Here?
That was close. You should’ve call me.
Hey, it is one more wolf.
Are you all right, Soon-Eee?
Help lip is little skinned.
Wait, try this. It was boiled at today morning.
You are so kind.
Thank you.
Well, it will never come again.
Let’s go inside.
What are you doing?
Come back to your room and keep studying.
High school diploma will be useful even in America…
Mom, wait.
Huh?
Look there.
What is that?
Oh…Ms. Jeong!
Wait, stand still.
Is that what you saw last night?
Maybe, or Maybe not.
Get out
Go away! ! Go away!
Come here
TskTskTskTsk
Yes, come here
TskTskTsk
Is it a man?
Who are you?
Give something? This?
This?
Ok, here
What the smell…
Oh, give it more? This?
This? This?
Mom, what are you doing? Stop and let it go.
Wait a second, wait a second.
Why is he still here?
He can’t speak, right?
Yes…
It seems he understands word…
What are you looking at?
This is just a beggar.
Just drive it away.
Name is unknown
Age…unidentified…
Damn, it’s broken.
Ma’am, is there some…knife?
Wait, what? What are you going to do!
Uhm…
actually, we cannot do anything helpful for you.
I read from a newspaper that 60,000 children were abandoned during the war.
It seems the child is eighteen years old, isn’t it?
Orphanages will not accept such grown-up child.
Stay still.
Oh…There is scar on his face…
Oh my!
Ouh my!
What’s wrong with hime
Has been abused, maybe
You must take him to the station and investigate
Isn’t it a duty of policeman?
You’re right, but then, I will be punished by the chief.
Just kick it out, really!
O…Okay, I will investigate this further, so keep him for a while.
Wait, why me?
Oh my, I have said already,
60,000 children were abandoned during the war.
One copy of application form, three copies of resident registration,
Two copies of an abstract of the register, One copy of income certificate,
Wait…can you speak little slower…
Tax Certification
(?)Certification, Employment Certification,
child protection condition investigation paper
Child protection…
I, I am not the protector
He was in front of the house today morning…
Then you should to a police station.
But police recommended me to come here
Just consider yourself as a protector, and send him out due to difficulty in caring.
Why send him to orphanage if there is a protector?
Ah…Ma’am, you’re so clueless.
Madam
There is…another easy way.
What is it?
So, how much did you get?
5,000 won.
What!?
Goodness, 5,000 won!
Bastards!
First of all…we should wash him.
lol
What!
Hey, Soon-Ja.
Bring daddy’s cloth, whichever.
You, come here
What the hell! What are you doing! He is drinking water instead of washing!
What sound are you making? Take off!
Come here, take off!
Oh, what a smell…
Take off, take off!
Why does such feeble woman have to wash grown man like you?
But it seems you know what is embarrassment
From the way you are grabbing pants.
I will just wash your back
Do it yourself…
Hey.
Is he sleeping?
Mom?
What are you doing? Come here.
Come here, take a meal
take a meal
Take a meal, here.
Meal, ok?
Oh my gosh
What a pity..
TskTskTskTsk
Maybe he was so hungry…
What should we do with him?
Uhm…
I said everything to county office, so the answer will be soon
What will you do until then?
Ah...
Uhm…huh…
I heard he knew a lot of people working in such field.
Let’s keep him until the problem is solved.
What!?
Just a few days~
Hmm?
Listen, I don’t know how long it may last…
Hey, Soon-Eee
I will keep you promise
Sleep quietly and comfortably.
Without making noises, ok?
Understand?
You! Stop making strange noise!
You must be quiet at night!
Come down!
I’m so tired unpacking the luggage.
When will it be finished?
Why didn’t you eat?
I am not eating with him any more.
I will go to post office in order to send the documents.
But…my dear daughter
When are you going to start study?
I am searching for my books.
Where is mine?
Go..Go away!
I said, go away!
Step back!!
Go away!!
I said go away!! Hey!!
Mom~~!!
Mom-!!! Mom-!!
You…

Nobody here?
Are you still unpacking luggage?
It’s so bad there is no man in the house.
Stay away, huh?
You damn bastard!
Three women in the house, and nobody have finished arrangement?
The boy is still here?
What is he doing there?
Let’s go.
I must study.
Qualification Exam?
What’s the use of it?
Just live together with me and make delicious stew.
Let me go!
Hey, come here~
I am going to Seoul, okay?
Since we will not able to meet each other for several days,
So let’s say goodbye properly
What?
You won't get away with this.
Thanks..
Hey, Mom! I can’t lift a spoon.

That’s too much.
Oh no, my meal.. lol
Please, boy, be quiet.

Mom, where is he?
Who, Cheol-Soo?
Cheol-Soo?
Yep.
I decided to call him Cheol-Soo.
Back in the day, your father wanted a son with name of Cheol-Soo.
But then Soon-Ja was born, and I felt so awkward even it was not my fault.
Cheol-Soo, where is he?
Soon-Ja took him outside.
She’s so audacious.
Little time has passed, and she is already wandering with other kids.
Brother!!
Brother!
You are plain noob.
In most cases, I play very well!
I’ll tell Granny you’re playing alone!
Me once again and Dong-Mi will play, ok?

Cheol-Soo!
Cheol-Soo! Kim Cheol-Soo!
There he is
Ah..

Why are you shouting at my kid?
Hey!
So he’s your son, haha
Mommy, me too.

Thanks, yes yes yes yes
Eat eat eat
Your children look so clever.
I also have two daughters and a son.

Why do you always eat even without chewing?
Hear, Mister.
Hey, tell me where you are going
Hey, tell me where you are going
/-One more please.
Are you listening?
Tell us where you are going~
Guys Guys Gusy..
Maybe he needs to go hospital.
Well, some scratches, reddening…
Phew, maybe there will be bruises~
Doctor, is this the only hospital around here?
I thing…we need to go to larger hospitals
Um, you know,

But I can do everything necessary!
As you see, I have worked here for 30 years…
As you see, I have worked here for 30 years…

How fast can you run?

Cheol-Soo
Take this
It’s a bean. With watering, it will grow.
Hey, I am faster than you.
Don’t be silly
Hey, if you treat the note like that, mom will punish you!
Don’t worry. It’s used up.

-Mommy
-Huh?
Buy me a baseball
Brother lost it the last time.
It begins again, huh
Cheoul-Soo threw a baseball, and it flew to where the goat was.
Cheoul-Soo seems athletic.
Maybe his proper job is an athlete?
By the way, mom
Until when Cheol-Soo will stay at our home?
I’m trying, so he will be in better place.
There is a friend in my class who lives in an orphanage, and he doesn’t even bring a lunch box
And wears same cloth every day.
Actually, it’s not so good place.
If somebody belittles me, I will pay him back to 10 times.
I have more money than all of you combined!
Hey, what are you mumbling alone?
What do you know?
Are you looking down on me? Huh!?
I will crush everyone who comes at me.
I will crush everyone who comes at me.
Understand!?
By the way, will we really go to yours mansion and drink one more time?
Good idea!
You are a hard drinker, aren’t you?
Eat me, please
Not drink but something else…
Why do you speak to him!
It’s all your fault!
Ah…
What?
What a moron
What shall we do?
Calm down, he can’t speak
What’s that? Huh?
Hey, you…
Cheol-Soo
You wake up when sun rises, don’t you?
Come here
Hey, you
Let’s talk.
Cheol-Soo
Um…

Say this, Dee-Gut
Hey, try speak it
Move your tongue like this.
Dee-Gut
Dee-
Eeeeeeh
Dee-Gut
Ehh, Dee Gut
Stop staring at me
Write next one
Next
Is it difficult!? Just write it!
Draw a line, like this
Just draw
If you don’t know, sketch. Ree-Eul
Wow… your hand is so warm..
Tray one time, two times, and everything will become familiar.
You will catch on quickly.
What are you doing?
See Mi-um, write on the paper.
Uh…
I haven’t played it for a long time, so I am not sure I can play it smoothly.
But let’s try
It’s a song I made long time ago, so don’t laugh.
I am waiting all night long♪
Until sun rises outside of the window♪
Because when morning comes♪
I can meet him♪
Thank you, for waiting me♪
Thank you, for looking at my eyes♪
Thank you, my dear prince♪
For appearing in front of me♪
There is…even second verse.
Hello?
[Hello? Is it Yoo Ok-Hee’s house?]
[This is a section chief Joe, from county office]
What’s the matter?
[I have inquired some places…there is no place in orphanages,]
[But I found one facility which is reliable.]
[Let’s bring him there tomorrow.]
[Excuse me?]
There is no such kid.
Hey! What are you searching for?
Did you hide food again?
Don’t give me.
I won’t eat…
Hey! How long have you worn it?
Mommy, you promised to buy Cheol-Soo’s cloth
If I were you, I would buy it coming back from post office.
Are you…finished?
Wow! This is the best thing among the cloth you have taken
Look, Look
Hey you are so funny!
Hey, look at me, look at me
You and I look so funny!
Hey, look, look
Look at you
Soon-Eee~
It’s mommy~
Hi Hi Hi, hide quickly!
I’m so tired…
There are shoes, but where is Soon-Eee?
Oh my gosh, maybe I have hold too much. I must go to restroom.
Hey Cheol-Soo.
Stay there until I tell you to come out
Stay there until I tell you to come out
/-I’m back!
Mom!
No?
What? I’m in restroom now!
Hey, Kim Soon-Ja
Huh? When did you come from?
I have called you repeatedly~
Why did you not take it?
Where is Soon-Eee?
Maybe she went with Cheoul-Soo to play.
She used to stay at home all day, and now she’s always wondering around
What if she faint like last time…
I’m feeling ill, I want to rest
Go there and eat sweet potato, don’t bother me.
What’s uncle Jeong gonna do now? All goats ran away.
Mom, where does it come from?
You see, you should be more careful instead of pestering
I did, but it wasn’t here yesterday.
Do you think I’ll believe you?
You always just skim around and say it’s not there.
Every day you ask me, where is this, where is that
Mom, where is my long underware?
What do you think you are wearing now? Huh?
Go in to the room, pack your schoolbag and sleep
Wait
What are you doing so late in the night?
Hey…
I said, speak in high forms? Didn’t I!?
This little girl is so ungrateful~
일Let’s go together.
I’ll buy something yummy.
Come here! Let’s talk!
Don’t disappoint me
Cheol-Soo, stay there.
So you’ve been there, huh?
You, come here.
You, come here
How it makes such sound?
It’s not even puppy
If you continue behave badly…
What’s that?
Wh…What?
Don’t come here!
Don’t come here!
Don’t come here! I was wrong!
Won’t do it! Won’t do it!
Papa!!
Wait!
Wait..
Ghost?
Soon-Eee, you saw that too, right?
I don’t know
Whatever, uh…
This girl said you had broken in the house and attempted to assault,
So let’s go together
Broke in?
Wait
This is my house
You even don’t know who is attacker and who is victim!
Hey, do you know who pays your hospital bills?
Do you know who give you the house, bitch!!
My father!
My father found the business and you joined afterward
Ha! After my father’s death you stole the corporation asset and living well,
I know what the truth is
Even if you mutter about pension and medical bill,
It will not help you a little so shut up!
Oh my, darling!
Gosh, what’s she saying?
Stop, stop
You are now just crazy bitch
I have nothing to say,
If you don’t kick out that thing
Your family will be outside.
Your family will be outside.
Alright, done!
I said exactly same.
Officer,
Let’s go together to the office.
Have you seen the knife and club he used?
Let’s go there and examine properly!
Since it has come to this, why not call you father, huh!?
I have had so many questions to father, so that’s great!
If you can’t
Our family
Cheol-Soo
Leave us along and quit silently.
Oh, you are going too far…
That bitch!!
Officer, stop a fight please!
Do you know who is my father!!?
Cheol-Soo.
What’s that?
So, you…
Drank alcohol, right?
Did you drank "makgeolli"?
Well, uhm…just a little, what?
A little
Drank Venus a little. Venus.
Ah~ Venus, Ah, liquor
Wow ~ I’ve heard if someone drinks much liquor, he can’t recognize his own parents.
You don’t believe me!?
I mean,
We were doing absolutely nothing,
Then he appeared and! Threw everything!
And, killed everyone else!
You must jail that monster!!
Nobody killed. It’s just slight wound.
Hey, you!!
Why can’t you live quietly, causing trouble at night.
Uhh, well I…
What the…!?
They are the one who have frequently visited here.
And…
Now I see the situation is not so good.
Vandalism, trespassing, inciting violence.
And, of course this is not what I should worry about,
Ehh…company property…blah blah…
What does that mean?
Cheoul-Soo, please stay calm.
Okay! Then let’s call it a day
Villagers should not sue each other.
We want both families to reach compromise through conversation.
Office, unlock it please.
Ouch…What the smell
Oh my, I can’t even breath.
Soon-Eee, are you smelling this?
Smell? What smell?
Oh shit, what the…
Why is it there?
That’s all Cheol-Soo’s.
By the way…
Have you called to my father?
Yeah…of course.
I don’t want a quarrel, so I’ll overlook this.
Okay.
Well, why should we fight each other?
She will marry with me anyway.
So let’s get along well, okay?
Where did you take such monster from?
This bastard
Must not be allowed to get out from the room.
It’s dangerous creature.
What…what is this?
Ex-owner’s stuff found during the arrangement.
I thought they are discarded, but some still have left.
Park Jeong-Doo?
Are you Prof. Kang Tae-Shik?
What? You didn’t even knock.
Do you know Prof. Park Jeong Doo?
I have seen something amazing
Maybe…
Maybe you know something.
Sit down.
Sit down, your leg will hurt.
Sit down!
Wait!
The smell hasn’t vanished even after cleaning.
It’s cold, what are you doing there?
Go into the house.
I feel stuffy in the room.
By the way, why do you study so hard lately?
I’m going to the post office for sending documents.
I got in because of cold.
That’s enough.
Is it me?
No..
This is no more.
Instead, I brought another stuff to give you.
Tada~
This is a book my father bought for me.
I haven’t read it yet.
But, I won’t read this for ever.
Because you will read this to me.
When you will learn all letter and word,
Read it to me.
Then, I will stroke your head hundred times.
This is order, you know?
By the way, do you know what is snowman?
Have you seen snow?
You should roll a snowball and make human figure.
We will make it when snow comes.
Do you remember the hill where we played with Soon-Ja?
If we make such a biiiiig snowman there,
It will be so exciting, right?
Promise
Do like this.
What are you doing?
Go and study
Oh my, it’s so stuffy.
You
What did you do until now?
Why didn’t you learn language?
But I envy your strength.
I have no special skills,
Bad grades…
You are good man, right?
You won’t beat people anymore, will you?
Will you?
You must learn from me a lot.
Are you going to live at our house with me?
Say Yes, Yes
Hey
Do you see the pile of stone, below there?
If one of us reaches the pile first, then other one will grant his wish.
Without question, okay?
I’ll say ‘one, two, three, go!’ as a signal.
Understand?
One..
Two!
There’s nobody in my house.
Brother went to school.
Soon-Eee!
Soon-Eee! Cheol-Soo!
Soon-Eee! Cheol-Soo!
Kim Soon-Eee!
Soon-Eee!
Phew! Where are they?
There, maybe?
I believe she is playing with brother somewhere.
Ah, don’t cry.
I knew this would happen, huh?
Something told me that a serious matter would happen.
I knew there would be trouble!
How did they unlock the door?
Soon-Eee!
Kim Soon-Eee!
Wait, who are they?
Uh..I don’t know
We found it!!
Wh…where? Where is it?
Sis!
Soon-Eee!
What, what are you doing?
Soon-Eee
Who are you!?
Kid, relax. It’s just a tranquilizer.
Why did you shoot this to my brother!
Kid, it’s dangerous
Hey, kid, kid!
Brother, let’s go home
What are you doing he…
Soon-Eee! Oh my God, Son-Eee!
Soon-Eee… Soon-Eee, are you alright?
Wake up, Soon-Eee!
She should not be outdoors so long.
Wolf has several features.
Wolf can live in packs unlike other Korean predatory animals,
Also it can continuously chase after prey with an incredible tenacity…
Furthermore, it can endure the long period of starvation.
평The only species that love only one female during his entire life…
What are you talking about?
Eeh, is it do difficult?
It means,
Park Jeong-Doo wanted to create a better soldier for infiltration.
Park Jeong-Doo wanted to create a better soldier for infiltration.
Oh my…where should I begin…
So, He is not human but animal?
Is it what you want to say, huh?
Park Jeong-Doo used to study same field with me,
And since he was my close friend, he sent me mails several times,
They were about…
Let’s not speak unnecessary words.
Let’s not speak unnecessary words.
Is there anything to drink?
Oh, okay…
Since the object of research is human, it has serious ethical problem.
So, if this is known to general public,
A lot of criticism will be prompted.
If a foreign press discovers about it…
Anyway,
Officials who ordered the research at Park Jeong Doo…
Oh my…
There is no evidence of government intervention!
I didn’t say such thing.
I conducted research out of sight, on my own!
What the mess...
Don’t try to learn more.
Well, I haven’t even tried…
In any case, we must take Cheol-Soo and…
Find out more about this.
Hey, that’s different from yesterday’s decision.
The kid must not be known to public.
We can’t take him outside.
If you conduct research on your own,
Why are you so careful?
Damn! If superior gave such order it must be followed.
Why are you quibbling!?
To tell the truth, I don’t know it either
To tell the truth, I don’t know it either
Anyway,
If he is a dangerous man, if
We have to…kill him.
Kill him?
Yes
If it is known to public..
No…taking him outside is dangerous
Eh, Um, you…Uh…
I can’t understand a thing what you are talking about.
Maybe, there is some misunderstandings.
Cheol-Soo is good boy!
He can’t just speak fluently.
Ma’am
Can’t you understand?
If we had arrived a bit later,
Soon-Eee
Would have been eaten by him
He shouldn’t have been here from the start
Don’t worry, Soon-Eee. Let’s go
I depend on your cooperation.
Tell them and give it quickly.
Sis, come back soon.
Soon-Ja
I’ll give it to you.
I’ll be back soon, so write letter 10 times until then.
Eat a lot, and don’t shout at night.
He’s escaping!!
Soon-Eee!
Soon-Eee, are you alright?
Wait
Cheol-Soo
Wait
I said it’s dangerous!
If this happen one more time,
We will shoot...
Shoot?
Don’t try to touch Cheoul-Soo when I’m not here!
Don’t try to touch Cheoul-Soo when I’m not here!
Mister, Let’s go
What are you doing alone?
Learning letters.
Ga Na Da Ra
Why?
Because he doesn’t know, that’s why.
As you see, there is no abnormal activity.
He’s just looking at the door
and learning letters.
Why does he not take a meal?
Because, there is no older sis.
Ouch, it’s so cold
Anyway!
If he shows abnormal or violent reaction,
Will be immediately shot.
Nothing can fool my eyes.
I can tell.
Whether dangerous or not.
Blood type cannot be identified.
And?
Sight, hearing, smell
Everything is excellent
Even too much.
Body temperature is also high…
How much?
46 degrees of Celsius
I think it’s not fever but just natural.
By the way, It must be studied further but
Bone density and muscular strength are similar to elephant.
If somebody asks, say everything is normal.
Yes sir.
If we don’t take him
He will die right here.
Soon-Ja!
Cheol-Soo
Let’s play top-spinning game.
It has rained already, so how to play a game?
I have to stay at home
Cheol-Soo cannot play, too
Why?
Just…He can’t.
Let’s play next time.
It was temporary shock.
Don’t worry.
It seems the home treatment is effective beyond my expectation.
Thank you, Doctor
I was so worried.
Mom
Huh?
Let’s go back.
By the way, this kid
Everything is normal
And mild than expected.
So,
He lost his parent and…just ill-bred kid. That’s all
I saw a lot of similar kids.
Of course it is.
And, Cheol-Soo is neat more than me.
Sometimes, I don’t clean teeth at night,
But he does even after lunch!
Mister Colonel! What…are you talking about? Huh?
You can see it mile off!
Didn’t I tell you?
How he…becomes a monster.
He’s different from us
Of course!
He can’ speak and unusually strong!
He is..
He is a demon, isn’t it?
What is…a demon?
By the way, I am so freehanded person,
And I can’t wait here endlessly.
That’s enough.
Come here
In my opinion,
He lacks sociality because he was raised among animals,
But he has ability and will to learn.
Although it should be observed further,
Presently, exterminating the kid is meaningless
Um, he has never shown violent behavior.
Yeah?
Then, report as nothing happened and go back?
Our brother looks so handsome.
Cheol-Soo…resembles my nephew.
That bastard
That bastard has eaten goats.
When?
Two weeks…ago?
At that night..
With him… at night?
S, So what?
I was driving a car when he…
Was eating mister Jeong’s goats.
Eat them?
How?
What?
How?
He was gnawing them like a wolfling.
Why do you say it now?
I was afraid he would attack me…
You were also there, right?
Why did you tell me?
Well, I’m doing now.
Do you know?
It’s written all over your face that you’re lying.
If you want lie, please do it properly, okay?
Your childish trick makes me even more angry!
What~?
It’s you who are pretending like didn’t see anything.
Uncle
You know that.
Cheol-Soo didn’t do this!
Did you see it?
How he gnawing goats?
I didn’t see it…but…
So?
I saw Cheol-Soo at the farm that night.
I saw Cheol-Soo at the farm that night.
Is the dead goat still there?
Is the dead goat still there?
Nope.
But..
It didn’t seem like the deed of a beast.
You’re wrong! I see everything!
Stop lying!
You cursed bitch!
Ji-Tae!
Mind your language.
Do you know who I am? Huh!?
Don’t you know how to behave!?
Everyone is crazy.
So we are fighting because of that little monster, huh?
Anyway, let’s visit the farm tomorrow,
But that’s enough for today.
Why?
I have something to tell you.
So what? Why!?
If it was Cheol-Soo, he would leap the fence over.
What?
If it was Cheol-Soo, he would leap the fence over.
There was no need to tear down it.
But as you see, the part of fence completely demolished.
Dead goat
It has broken ribs but no wounds.
Visit my farm tomorrow.
I have something to look at.
I put a straw mat on there to preserve a wheel track.
I’ll show this to them.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
If you confess it is lie,
I’ll say nothing, too.
Don’t persecute innocent people and just go back to Seoul.
That’s all I want to say.
Hey, Jeong.
Hello?
What?
Who is that?
It’s a journalist.
Journalist?
It’s uncle Jeong.
Did you really do that?
I’ll come in.
These bumpkins!
Hey, go out and look.
Yes, sir.
Blackout?
What the hell?
What are you doing?
Madam! It’s completely broken!
What? Broken what?
Dou you have a screwdriver?
Screwdriver?
Wait…
I just want to talk with you.
I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry.
It’s difficult to stay here, isn’t it.
Do you know where the guitar is?
Yes, the guitar. You can play music by it.
Recently,
Soon-Eee feels so bad.
The guitar is gone.
So…
She cannot sing and it makes her worse.
She can even die.
By the way, I discovered that
Mr Jeong had stolen it.
Uncle who raises goats.
Meeeeeh~
What a bastard did this?
By the way, it’s secret
Soon-Eee
Doesn’t like you.
She hates you.
Cheoul-Soo
Find the guitar
Then..
Maybe Soon-Eee will love you.
Go out and find it.
Oh, it’s working.
-Phew, that’s it.
-There’s light again.
Huh?
Where is he?
Help!
He is raging now!
He is raging now!
Huh? What?
How did he escape?
Where is he? Where!
I’ll search for.
He went to Mister Jeong’s farm
Maybe he wanted a meat.
What does it mean…
How do you know it?
I saw it on my way.
Where is there!
Go ahead!
Maybe you will need a real gun.
Gosh! What is this sound!
What? Who is there!
Cheol-Soo
Hey Cheol-Soo, what are you doing?
Oh! Why is he acting like this?
Cheol-Soo!
Oh my, what’s he doing!
Oh my!
Oh my God!
What, what’s happening?
Hey, go and bring her.
Um, Mr. Jeong.
are you alright?
What are you doing!
Hey!! Hey! You thief!
Ma…Ma’am!
Kim Cheol-Soo!
Kim Cheol-Soo!
Raise your hand and go out!
Don’t just stand there, go out!
Oh my! Darling!
Darling!
-Gosh! What the hell!
-Mr. Jeong
What?
Who is it?
Hey you!
Hey, where are you going?
Don’t go there!
Soon-Eee
Just come and stay here.
Come and stay here.
I will speak to him!
There’s Soon-Eee! Off you gun!
What are you doing!? Shoot it!
Shut your mouth, please!
Are you going to shoot a child?
If she get hurt, will you take all blame!?
Cheol-Soo
It’s not here
Come to me.
I’ll shoot if you move!!
Get away!
Put the gun down.
Get away, I said
Stop it, please.
I’ll talk.
There’s no need
Just get out
You! Hwang-Jee-Tae!
Put the gun down and step back!
Listen me, bastard!
I’ll count to three
If you don’t come out, you’ll die too.
One
Soon-Eee!!
Cheol-Soo, wait
Knock it off
Two
Knock it off
Knock it off!!
Soon-Eee!!
Cheol-Soo, wait!
Soon-Eee!!
Hey! Stop!
What is that?
I was so tender to you!
I loved you very much
Cheol-Soo
Calm down…and come to me
Pursue and
shoot him
Cheol-Soo
Are you really monster?
What is real?
What is…
Your true nature?
But I don’t care.
I’m..
I’m ok even if…
I’m ok even if..you are a monster.
Soon-Eee-!!
Soon-Eee-!!
Hide yourself.
Quickly.
People are coming.
I’ll go to them
And say you have run away, so don’t follow me.
Go, you idiot.
If you are caught, you are dead
I can’t be with you now.
Go!
Get off!
I hate you so get off!!
Let me go!
Go! Go you idiot!
Ah..
I’m sorry Cheol-Soo...
It is for your sake
Don’t come!
Don’t come! I’ll go!
I’ll go so don’t come here!!
Don’t go…
Don’t come! I’ll go!
Go! And don’t come!
Don’t come!
Here!
What?
Here she is, Colonel!
She was coming on foot, alone.
Are you ok?
Where have you been all night?
Where is he?
I don’t know
What!?
Gosh, she knocked around whole night, and you…
Are you lying!?
I don’t know
He ran out.
You came along with him, and how he…
-Hey! If you were together, then how…!
-Stop splitting hairs!
You ran together, how you don’t know!
Stop it!!
Calm down.
If something happen to child, then you…!
What to do next?
If the operation gets bigger, it’ll be in the air.
But our initial purpose was to keep secret, wasn’t it?
Today…there will be a reporter…
If we keep our mouth shut, everything will be fine.
Well, if not,
Try to do it right, one more time.
Let’s go.
We won’t abandon here forever.
If he appears again,
Call me first.
Okay?
We…
Are going to move out from here.
Mom, what to do with this?
I wanted to buy him new cloth…
And I couldn’t
Sis! Come here!
Goodbye~!
Bye~!
Therefore, when Dong-An Corp. went bankrupt,
The house was turned over to Yoo-Ok-Hee.
And when she died, she bequeathed you the house.
There will be a pension complex in the vicinity, so I recommend you to sell it.
It’ll be sold at good price.
Could we sleep one night here?
There are no rats, I suppose?
By the way Granny, why did you chose this place?
I don’t know
You always don’t.
Granny, look at this.
Wow~ Who is this handsome child?
Looking good, right?
Yeah.
Does he have some money?
Not so much, I think?
Then don’t mix with him.
Pooh, but he is so kind.
Treat him well.
All men like compliments.
If you grow up, you can see what wasn’t seen before.
Knowing more sounds great,
But it makes you a coward.
There is only one chance in our life.
That time…
Never comes back
Oh, hello?
It’s completely out-of-the-way village.
Grandma?
Granny is strong, you know.
yes
uh..
Oppa
I’ll call you later.
Uh, nothing.
Good Night.
What is this?
It's stun gun.
Which papa bought last time.
Somebody may break in.
Me…
Did you wait for me?
Come here.
Stop waiting now
Cheoul-Soo, I am sorry
Why? Why did you wait for?
I’m sorry.
I’ve done everything.
Eat what I want, wear what I want,
Married with other man
Raised children
I lived like this.
I’m…sorry.
I am an old lady now.
My hairs…
Turned white.
No.
It’s same
Hands,
Mouth,
Eyes..
You’re still beautiful.
So much..
I'm missing you, so much
Snowman…
...
And suddenly,
His heart
Became warmer.
Excellent.
It’s deep black like charcoal
And made of brass.
Put the wood in its mouth,
And it will burn, spitting flames.
Are you going now?
What?
Did you left something behind?
Let’s go
Granny
I saw a strange person yesterday.
He looked at me for long time when I was making a call
Usually, it must be scary, right?
But it didn’t.
Why it didn’t?
Yep
[Hi, it’s section chief Kim from county office.]
Yeah, wait a minute.
Granma, It’s the public officer.
I won’t sell it.
[What? Wait, you said…]
Thank you, for waiting meet♪
Thank you, for looking at my eyes♪
Thank you, my dear prince♪
For appearing in front of me♪
All day, I wait for the moon to rise in the sky♪
Because when night comes, I can talk to you♪
Don’t forget our promise♪
Don’t forget our secrets♪
Don’t forget how my heart raced when you talk to me♪
I guess all that comes to people who wait is love
I was so exhausted, I couldn’t even fathom what to do
Why can’t I let you go?
I keep chiding myself and blaming myself
But I still can’t erase you
You’re the first person that I’ve ever wanted to give everything to
