I can't believe
they don't have
one good rock station.
Are you kidding me, boy?
That's stompin' music.
This will be
our last post.
So let's tough it out.
Morning. Sergeant major
Zack Carey.
Morning, sergeant major.
Welcome to fort clemmons.
Is this
all yours?
Personal belongings.
Never said
I travel light.
[ Men exclaim, whistle ]
Put it
on that side.
Sergeant major
Carey!
Sergeant major
Carey!
You calling me?
Sergeant major
Carey?
Yeah.
I'm Jerry elliott
from soldier magazine.
We'd like to interview
you and take pictures.
I just got here.
How did you
find me so quick?
You aren't exactly
the unknown soldier.
What's a soldier's
magazine's interest
in interviewing me?
You're the only one
in the U.S. army
Who owns
a fully operational
sherman tank.
I thought
everybody had one.
I knew a sergeant who
made a lamp out of one.
How long did it take you
to restore it?
Close to 15 years.
Spare part here,
spare part there.
Did it mostly
with my sons.
How old are they?
Well, Billy, he's 16,
And Jonathan...
Would be 22.
He's dead.
I'm sorry
to hear that.
Is this tank
all original?
Everything except
the loudspeaker and
tape deck for parades.
That way,
it could be declared
a public relations asset.
Why would anybody
want a sherman tank?
It's hard to shoot yourself
while cleaning it.
One, two,
three, four, hey!
One, two,
three, four, hey!
This is the way
we start our day!
This is the way
we start our day!
Knockin' down doors
and kickin' down walls!
Knockin' down doors
and kickin' down walls!
[ Intercom buzzes ]
Yes.
General hubik,
Sergeant major Carey
to see you.
Great. Send him in.
Reporting for duty, sir.
Good to see you,
general.
Well, well,
for an old fart,
you look great.
With your permission,
I'd say the same about you.
How's ladonna?
Fine, sir.
And your wife?
She has her moments.
All squared away?
Just about.
There's
a sergeant elliott
looking for you.
Already found me, sir.
He got me
before I had a chance
to test the latrines.
We're going for a drive.
You're creating quite
a stir with that tank
of yours.
I pulled a few strings
to let you keep
your tank here.
I appreciate that, sir.
If I may say so,
I'm glad my last assignment
is going to be under you, sir.
We're too young
for last assignments.
Yes, sir, but I
have made an offer
on a fishing boat.
If they accept it,
I'll put in my papers.
Give me two years,
And you may be the next
sergeant major of the army.
[ Man shouting commands ]
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate
that coming from you,
But it gets complicated.
I only
have one son left.
He's only got
a few more years at home.
That time
won't ever come again.
I've learned that, sir.
There'll be time
to talk about that later.
Pentagon duty isn't
half bad for a family.
Neither
is fishing, sir.
In your hat,
sergeant major.
Yes, sir,
three bags full.
Rear guard, recover!
Next?
Kitchen.
I've talked with
your mom and dad.
What about you?
What's it like
Having a command
sergeant major
for a father?
Made me
more religious.
Really? How's that?
I've realized the problems
Jesus must have had,
Being the son of God.
What sort of father
is your dad?
A cross between
George patton
and Danny Thomas.
Like he says,
"shit rolls downhill.
"If it's a bad day
at the post,
It's the wrong day to look
like a ragbag at home."
You call
about the boat?
Yeah.
You didn't tell me.
You didn't ask me.
It's like pulling teeth
to get information
out of you.
What did he say?
He'll call in
a couple of weeks.
Probably waiting to see
if they can get more.
I hope interest rates
don't go up.
What if they do?
They won't.
What if they do?
Do I tell them
they can't do that
'Cause ladonna Carey
said so?
You're as nervous
about that boat
as about that tank.
Go to the n.C.O. Club.
See if we know anybody
on this post.
You're a pretty good
old broad.
Just watch who
you're calling old.
Jesus, you're
a nervous old woman.
[ Laughs ]

Hey, Carey!
Carey!
Hi, tippet.
How you been?
What they got
you doing here?
I'm operations n.C.O.
With the provost marshal.
How's yourself?
I'm good.
You look good.
Look, I want you
to meet my wife.
Christ, I know Linda.
Uh... No, no.
Big mistake.
Linda is
the old wife.
New wife is Gwen.
Must not call her
old wife's name.
She'll be
upside your head
with a pool cue.
Hi. See anybody
we know?
Ed tippet.
Was Linda there too?
No. Gwen was.
Who's Gwen?
New wife.
Linda is old wife.
They got divorced?
I guess so.
I used to love to go
to the n.C.O. Club.
Not anymore.
Not unless you like
to play bingo
Or go to the disco
and dance
the funky monkey,
Whatever's
blaring in there.
They don't even call
them bars anymore.
I don't want
to go to a disco.
I want
to go to a bar.
You're acting like
the most crotchety
old bugger I've ever seen.
I'll show you
how young
you really are.
Why, miss Scarlett,
how you do talk.
I want to get that boat.
I want to finish things up
And get on that boat,
that's all.
Hey.
Hey, what?
G.I. Want
a good piece of ass?
I love you.
You better.
Gentlemen, the division
sergeant major.
At ease.
Is this
some hard-ass?
He went in at 16
probably got a wino
to sign for him.
I got a wino to sign for me too.
After he did, I said,
"thanks, dad."
You still
bought him booze.
Gentlemen,
be seated.
My name is
sergeant major Zack Carey.
These little chats
are usually full of crap.
I'll keep it short.
The bottom line is
we'll get our
collective shit together.
We'll make this outfit
combat-ready.
Coming over here,
I saw a couple of individuals
looking like ragbags.
That stops now.
Normally, if I was
a battalion sergeant major,
Some clown starts telling me
how to run my people,
I'm gonna personally
tell him to keep his nose
out of my business.
But these
are not normal times,
So I will park
in your pockets.
Concerning
quality of training,
more details later.
Concerning
quality of life,
We will handle
our people's problems.
Whatever it takes
to keep our people's minds
on their work,
That's what we'll do.
For me, at least,
the army is family.
We will take care
of our own
By the book,
but with tact...
And by tact I mean
don't let the bullshit
reach the brass.
We will handle
our problems in-house.
When a problem reaches
Your company or battalion
commander's hands,
It'll catch the attention
of that 600-pound gorilla
With two stars
on his collar.
And shit rolls downhill.
Keep that gorilla
off my back,
That'll keep me
off yours.
I want a beer bar on this
post with a soft jukebox
So old farts like me
can sip our suds in peace
And not have to dance
the funky monkey.
Thank you, gentlemen.
[ Buzz ]
Your division
sergeant major
Is all alone
on the battalion field!
[ Whistle blows ]
[ Man shouting commands ]
Morning,
sergeant major.
And a fine one it is.
Care to take
the air with me?
It would be the highlight
of our day.
Battalion!
Company, right face!
Forward battalion,
march! Hoo!
Column left, march!
Double time!
[ Men shouting ]
[ Men clapping and chanting ]
[ Chanting approaching ]
I'm gonna rock
the livin' day!
Shake, rattle, and roll,
everybody!
Shake, rattle, and roll,
everybody!
Shake, shake, shake
a little longer!
Shake, rattle,
and roll, hey!
Pick 'em up!
Set 'em down!
Rock it!
All right!
Here we go!
Bye, mom.
Ladonna!
Ladonna!
Billy! Ladonna!
We did it!
Help me with
these grocery bags.
Do you know who
you're talking to?
We got the boat?
You better believe
we got the boat.
They took our offer,
locked in
at the same rate.
Yahoo!
Let's forget
that ham in the oven
And have dinner out.
I have the n.C.O. Wives' club
meeting here tonight.
You said you'd eat out.
Screw the n.C.O. Wives.
Let's go celebrate.
I can't do that.
Best news in 10 years,
Billy's out on a date,
And you've got
that crew of Amazons!
I told you five times
about tonight.
Have dinner in town.
* my pretty girl
* sell me some dreams
* my pretty girl...
One of these days,
I'll go to
beautician school.
I did my girlfriends'
hair in high school.
Yeah?
Maybe I'll go
to California.
This girl
in playboy owns
a barber shop.
I want my own place.
No crap from nobody.
I'll drink
to no more crap.
I'll name my boat
the no more crap.
Maybe I'll name it
after you. The Sarah.
That's it.
The Sarah.
Long may she sail.
The Sarah.
I've been in the army
almost 30 years.
'Bout time
I went Navy.
Like to hear
a song?
On the jukebox?
No. I'll give you
a rare treat.
I'll sing you
an old sea shanty
In the key of z-flat.
* when I was
a little boy *
* so my mother
told me *

* way, haul away
40 bucks an hour.
* away, Joe.

Shoot the ball.
Shit!
Just shut up
from here on out.
I'll bust your head.
Hey!
Cut out that warbling.
There's a game going on.
I'm sorry about
that, deputy.
Bad manners
to be singing
during a game.
I'll buy
you a beer.
Don't need you
to buy me no beer.
Sarah, you're
supposed to
be turning tricks.
Don't waste time
on this old boy.
Probably couldn't
get it up anyway.
Get your ass up
and earn some money.
Don't do that.
Say what?
No need for that.
Ain't no need for
no army scumbag
Telling me
what to do
In my town,
with my whore.
You know something?
You're just as right
as rain.
Your town, your whore.
Is that right?
You proved your point.
Deputy, let me ask you
a question.
How would you
like someone to...
He's got
the gun!
Why did you do that?
He only
slapped me around.
I could have lost
my job, asshole!
Don't get sentimental.
A simple "thank you" would do.
[ Doorbell buzzes ]
[ Buzz ]
All right,
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What the hell
is all that racket?
Zack?
What's the problem?
It's 2:00 in the morning.
We got to talk.
I did an El dummo.
I'll admit it.
I know these
cracker towns.
Dollars to doughnuts
the local constabulary
Will be in provost
marshal's office
Looking to stick
my ass in jail.
You gonna pay
for the damages?
I'll pay the guy 500
to cool things out.
You might have
to go higher.
The sheriff's
a mean cracker.
Morning,
sheriff.
Good morning.
Would you
like some coffee?
Thank you kindly.
I believe I would.
In my office,
please, euclid.
Yes, sir.
Euclid?
Yes, sir?
Where is he?
Who's that, sheriff?
He's not in our jail.
And I don't see
no arrest report.
On who, sir?
He in the hospital?
I'd like
to believe that.
Um... Sheriff...
I...Uh...
Or in the morgue?
There should
be a report here.
Don't you care
about your paperwork?
Sheriff, I'm not, uh...
Sure I know
who you mean.
Look at your face, son.
Somebody marked it up
when you was on duty.
When on duty,
you represent me.
Yes, sir.
Who marked you up while
you was representing me?
Because now I've
got marks on my face.
That I can't have.
Spell me.
He's out there,
big as life.
Well, Jesus Christ!
That son of a bitch
has got nerve.
Jesus Christ
on a crutch!
That's a breach
of professional etiquette.
Coming without calling me?
Pulling a surprise inspection
without letting me know?
A breach of etiquette.
I ain't afraid of him.
I'll get me
a meat cleaver.
I'll breach
that mother's skull.
Sergeant major Carey?
This is
a breach of etiquette.
I won't take this.
This is my mess hall.
Keep your nose out.
27 years I been
running mess halls.
Eisenhower ate my cooking.
I won't stand
for no surprise inspections.
Sergeant, I came in here
because the food
smelled good,
I wanted to
eat with soldiers,
Not at the n.C.O.
Country club.
The food's excellent.
It is excellent.
Place is clean.
I run a clean mess.
Nobody slops
the food.
Served with
pride, respect.
Nobody better
slop my food!
My compliments to you
and your entire staff.
You taste
that apple cobbler?
I was going to.
Taste that,
then you talk
about my food.
Sergeant.
Yeah?
Best fucking
apple cobbler
I ever tasted.
Give that man seconds!
Morning, Sarah.
Morning, sheriff.
Do you believe
in wonder woman?
Who?
Wonder woman, like on TV.
Do you believe in her?
No, sir.
Well, now, that's good.
How about
the lone ranger?
Is there really a lone ranger,
like in the comics?
Sheriff, I don't know
what you're talking about.
Just answer the question,
sister Sarah.
Do you believe
in the lone ranger?
No, sir.
Ah, liar, liar,
pants on fire!
You think the lone ranger
wears army green.
That's dangerous
for a lady in your position.
You do business with
them people, of course.
But that's all.
Don't get
personal with them.
They ain't our kind.
That's a lesson
you'll have to learn.
You got to learn it good.
So...
Pull up your
little shirt.
Take down
your drawers.
Turn over.
Get to it.
I'm going to teach you
There really ain't
no lone ranger.
I got this one.
I'd like to see
the provost marshal.
He's not in.
Can I help?
Well,
maybe you can.
I bet you know
who he is.
He's a master sergeant,
or some such thing.
First name's Zack.
He's wanted for
battery on my deputy,
And whatever else
I can think of.
Look no further.
We got him.
I want him.
He turned himself
in to the mps
last night.
He'll be sorry
when we get through.
How much will
he have to pay?
He'll pay, all right.
First, he'll spend
time in my jail.
It's lucky we got
a chance to talk.
I'll save you all
kinds of paperwork.
You're aware of the
supreme court decision,
Clarence versus
kern county,
Ruling that all
military personnel
Committing a crime in
civilian jurisdiction...
I don't want
supreme court crap!
I want that son of a bitch.
I want his name.
I want him in jail.
Do you understand, boy?
Yes, sir.
I sure do.
The military
don't want trouble
with your town.
I'll have him
in 15 minutes.
That's what I like.
If you
want him that bad,
You got a problem
we'll nip in the bud.
I don't see you
locating my man.
I'll have him here
with cuffs on.
Will that do?
If you do it.
And by 5:00,
your town will
be off-limits
To all
military personnel.
We don't want you
to have problems
with the army,
So take him.
And don't worry
about soldiers
In any of your bars
Or your restaurants
or your whorehouses.
That should
cure your problem.
Okay, sambo.
You win this one.
There's more
than one way
to skin a cat.
You better
believe it, Jim.
By the way...
You best watch
how you drive
off this post.
This is
federal property.
You might spend
time in my jail.
Euclid!
I want to know
everything about
that sergeant major.
I want it all,
and today.
[ Child crying out ]
Hold him still.
It's going
to be ok.
Daddy's not mad
at you anymore.
It's okay, Brian.
[ Knocking ]
Come in.
Corporal Harris reporting.
You wanted to see me?
Sit down,
corporal.
I saw your son
at the hospital.
He's pretty
badly beat up.
Did you do it?
According to the army,
that's none
of your business.
I can call
the provost, but...
Nobody's
pressing charges.
Hey, corporal,
you want
to make it hard?
I'm trying
to keep this
inside this office.
Fine.
Let's keep it here.
Your wife's scared
to file a complaint.
Sooner or later,
it'll blow up.
I'm trying
to avoid that.
We got good
counseling here.
I want you
to volunteer.
Nobody will know.
I'll keep it quiet.
But you
need help, son.
Is that it?
You're not
going for it?
Am I dismissed?
Let me put it
another way.
The next time you're
losing control
And want
to hit somebody,
you come hit me.
We can
put on gloves
or Duke it out...
Look. My family
is my business!
It's not
your goddamn...
Hear this, asshole!
I'm checking
that hospital daily.
If that boy's in there,
I'll destroy you.
My retirement,
my stripes,
The stockade
won't mean shit.
I'll destroy you
in a heartbeat!
Do you believe that?
Do you?
Yes,
sergeant major.
You will
get some counseling.
Dismissed!
Hi, bill.
Hi, dad.
Where's mom?
Shopping,
I guess.
You're cracking the books
early, aren't you?
I've got
basketball practice
and an early date.
Smells like mom's
cooking up a good dinner.
Did you check that
early date out with her?
Yeah, I told her
this morning.
Think you'll miss
some good ham, son.
Oh, Christ.
I'm getting
too old for it.
For ham?
No, all the bullshit.
I had a clown
in my office today,
Beat up his
5-year-old boy.
Could've broken
his neck.
When you raise a kid right,
then he gets killed,
And you see that.
Turns your stomach.
Dad?
I was thinking.
If we get that boat,
Maybe we
could call it
Johnny boy.
I don't need a boat
to remind me
of your brother.
I thought it'd be nice,
since he was
your favorite.
Wait. You want to run
that by me again?
Not really.
Bill...
Come over here.
Come over
and sit down.
Do you ever think
I wish it was you
Instead of
your brother
that was dead?
That question sucks.
Yes, it does.
It'd be rotten
if you believed that,
and it isn't true.
Johnny was
your first-born.
It's natural you'd
feel more for him.
Makes sense,
doesn't it?
No, it doesn't.
We felt something
different for him,
But not anything
more or better.
Mom always said
you and Johnny were alike.
You had to feel
something more.
Because we were alike,
when he was little
we got along,
But when he
was a teenager,
He tried to prove
things to me.
Maybe that's why
he got killed.
But I swear,
not for one second
Did I wish it was
you that got it.
You straight on that?
Yes, sir.
I got to go.
Bill?
You squared away
on all that?
Yes, sir.
Break it up!
William Carey!
Yes, sir?
Mr. Taylor wants
to speak to you.
I don't understand.
Why do you want
to see my locker?
It might be nothing.
It's just something
we want to check out.
These men
are deputy sheriffs.
They've got questions.
This your locker?
Yes, sir.
Want to open it?
That's not my lock.
Just open the locker.
That's not my lock.
Honest, that's
not my lock.
What's going on here?
The sheriff's office
received reports
That you've been
selling marijuana.
That's not true!
Ask the janitor
to open that lock.
Go ahead.
Excuse me.
Well, well, well.
Lookee what
we got here.
I'd like to see
the sheriff, please.
Well, right this
way there, general.
Right this way.
Someone to
see you, sheriff.
Okay.
Sheriff says okay.
Well, sheriff, uh...
Buelton.
I am Zack Carey.
I did a dumb thing
the other night,
Then tried to
weasel out of it.
I'm sorry.
You win, I lose.
Now, what can I do
to get my son back?
Euclid, bring
your camera in here.
You wouldn't mind
posin' for a picture
with me, would you?
If not, sergeant,
Back over against
that wall.
Right over here.
Euclid's never seen
a talking asshole before,
And I'd like him
to have a souvenir
photo of it.
All right, euclid.
I think I'll
call this,
"Sheriff buelton
gets his man,"
Unless you got
a better idea.
Well, let's see what
we got here, sergeant.
"William Carey...
"Possession of narcotics,
"Possession with
intent to sell same,
"Assaulting
a peace officer,
And resisting arrest."
If I know the judge...
And he's my
brother-in-law...
This could get
that boy of yours
Two years
on the county farm.
All right, sheriff,
Like I said, you win.
Give me a number.
I'll pay.
You get to the heart
of the matter.
I'm going to let you
come up with the number,
But after you've visited
our correctional facility.
Move it! Move it!
Come on, boy!
Move it! Move it!
Move it!
Come on, boy!
Come on, come on.
Hurry!
We practice
a modern form
of penology here.
We try to
rehabilitate
the prisoners
Through a system
of positive and
negative feedback.
The work here,
that's a privilege.
And that's
positive feedback.
On the other
hand, well...
Trustee Jackson!
Yeah, boss!
Show us an example
of negative feedback.
Right now, boss.
You, boy!
You're lazy!
That's what's
wrong with you!
I get the point.
You don't need to
do this for me.
No, sergeant,
this ain't the army.
Here I say
the "have-tos"
And "don't have-tos."
I say that youngster's
malingering.
That's antisocial
behavior that calls
for negative feedback.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
You're just lazy.
That's all that's wrong!
I hope you found
our tour helpful.
Give me a number,
and you got it.
That's the trouble
with your kind.
You don't
appreciate subtlety.
You come down here
to change our ways,
Because the supreme
court's on your side.
You're finding out
we ain't broken-legged.
Want a number? $10,000.
What do you think
the army pays?
I wouldn't know.
I'm an ignorant cracker,
But soldier magazine
wrote a story on you.
Said you owned
your own tank
And just bought
a fancy boat.
That sounds like
a millionaire
to a poor boy like me.
I bet you could
sell that boat
And raise that money.
[ Gate buzzes ]
Oh, sergeant...
Uh... One more thing.
I think it would
be inadvisable
For you to bring
some Jew lawyer here
To talk about
civil rights.
I'd have your boy
on this farm
Before you can
say "habeas corpus."
Okay, sheriff, you'll
get everything you want,
But remember, anything
happens to my boy,
Nothing will prevent me
from killing you.
He's the only thing
keeping you alive.
And vice versa, sergeant.
You remember that.
Billy, are you okay?
I didn't do
what they say.
Somebody's else's lock
was on my locker.
It has nothing
to do with you.
Then why am I
sitting in this jail?
No, it's the sheriff.
The sheriff's using
you to get me.
I'll do what he wants,
then you're out.
But why, dad?
It's a long story.
Once you're out, I'll
tell you everything.
You'll get out,
understand?
Okay.
Can you hang in here?
Yes, sir.
That's the way
to talk to these guys...
"Yes, sir"
and "no, sir."
In a day or two,
You'll be out of here,
I promise.
Have I ever
broken a promise?
No, sir.
I'm not gonna start.
I promise you
I will get you
out of here.
That's a promise.
Bastard! You rotten,
filthy bastard!
My baby's in jail,
because you went whoring.
We'll get Billy back,
Then you do whatever
you have to.
Oh, no.
I've got this
figured out.
We can cut
those bills...
No! We are
getting a lawyer!
Our son will not
be handled
Between good ol' boys.
You have no
right to talk.
You don't understand.
This guy's evil.
We're not doing things
his way or your way.
I'm getting a lawyer.
You have no right
to tell me different.
You left your rights
on a barroom floor!
Ladonna!
Ladonna!
All right,
talk to a lawyer,
But don't take
any action
Without telling
me first.
I'll do the same.
Okay?
Okay?
[ Horn honks ]
Zack!
[ Horn honking ]
Zack!
First sergeant,
take over the inspection.
What is it?
I tried, Zack.
I didn't understand
what you meant.
I didn't believe you.
Believe me about what?
About the sheriff.
Oh, Christ!
Move over.
He's here, sheriff.
Well, lookee
who's here... Mr. stupid.
You are as dumb
as you can be.
I told him not
to bring lawyers in,
But he wouldn't
listen to me.
We get some big lawyer
in from out of county,
We don't want
to waste his time,
So we held a trial.
Now you know what?
Your lawyer's in
jail... contempt
of court.
We'll finish
this conversation
in my office.
Take the money.
Give me my son.
Please.
Oh, you do know
the magic word.
Sergeant, it's my
sad duty to report
Your son
was sentenced
To three years
on the county farm.
I'll take the money.
It'll keep him alive
for a year.
After that,
I'll take more.
We made a deal!
Any more lawyer noise,
And he'll be shot
attempting escape.
Yes, sir.
I got power to do
almost anything
on that farm,
Except stop the course
of true love.
That I can't do.
You see, unfortunately,
We do have some
degenerates on the farm.
Unless I'm mistaken,
They'll fall in love
with your little boy.
Of course, it will be
A learnin' experience
for him.
Sheriff told me
why I was here,
Before he beat me.
'Cause of you
and your whore!
Bill.
Was she worth it?
Look at me!
[ Telephone rings ]
Hubik.
Are you sure?
Well, stop him.
Block the main gate.
[ Men clamoring ]
[ Tank approaching ]
[ Pounding on door ]
All right, all right!
I'm coming!
Somebody better have
a good reason for knocking,
Or they'll
spend time in jail!
Oh, lord.
I do believe
I got you covered.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, lord. Uh... Uh...
Please, mister. I...
Bring my son out.
Don't be cute.
I'm in a bad mood.
I want to, sergeant,
I swear to Jesus,
But the sheriff
thought you might
pull that legal stuff,
So he transferred him
to the county farm.
He's on
the work detail.
Who's
inside the jail?
Uh... Just
a couple of drunks.
He's lying.
Shut your mouth.
You know
what would happen
If I pulled
this trigger?
He's got your
lawyer in there.
Get the deputy's keys
and let everybody out.
Yes, sir.
Where's the sheriff?
At the state capitol
Meeting
with the governor.
Is that so?
I swear
on my mama's eyes.
Rip the radio
out of that squad car.
Uh... Uh...
I can't do that.
That there's a new radio.
The sheriff would kill me.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Oh, shit!
Do telephone calls
go through those boxes?
They sure do.
Holy shit!
My car!
My goddamn car!
Oh... Shit!
Sarah, give me
that gun belt.
You, come here.
Come on.
Now, strip.
Go on. Strip.
[ Crowd laughs ]
Shit.
Don't let this
take all day.
Here, Sarah.
Handcuff him to
that post over there.
Go on. Go!
Can I go with you?
I can't stay here.
Jump on.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Okay, now.
You stay there.
Close the hatch.
What are you doing?
You're crazy!
Lie down, Billy,
I'm coming to get you.
Lie down.
Damn it, lie down!
You're crazy!
You'll get us killed!
Ooh!
Yea! All right! Yea!
Hooray! Okay! Yea!
Well, where is
this invading army
we're supposed to stop?
Holy shit!
I'd sure like
to help, but...
Governor, I got
a crazy sergeant.
I got a dope fiend,
and a hooker
In a sherman tank!
They've destroyed
three squad cars,
Two trucks,
my office,
and a '74 Chevy!
Call out
the national guard
And blow that
son of a bitch away!
I suppose I could, but
that would take a lot of time.
See what the army
can do for you, buddy.
In clemmonsville today,
There was
an unusual prison break.
Sergeant major Zack Carey
broke his son out
Of the county
correctional facility
Using a sherman tank.
All right.
Thank you, son.
What's
your big plan?
We'll head for
the Tennessee state line
Over back roads
and broken country.
It'll slow
them down.
What's
she doing here?
Bill,
Look, once you get
across the state line,
If they want you,
they have to extradite you.
That means a fair hearing
in a court of law.
What's she?
My lawyer?
At that hearing,
Sarah will testify
That she was forced
into prostitution,
And you and I
can tell our story.
They'll believe us
over a sheriff?
That sheriff is not
part of the system.
In a fair hearing,
a lawyer can work.
We're not running
away from the law.
We're running
t the law, bill.
We'll win.
They'll lose, general!
They're going
down in flames,
and you're going to help.
I can have
the governor
call your superior.
Either way, want to see
some tanks rolling out of here
to stop that maniac.
I don't take orders
from governors.
Sergeant major
Carey's resigned.
He's committed
no crime in
my jurisdiction.
He stole a tank!
It's his tank.
All he did
was bust a fence.
I'm the local
civilian authority.
I'm making
a formal request
of the military
To do everything in its power
to assist me
in apprehending...
Posse comitatus,
sheriff.
Did you call me
a pussy communist?
The U.S. army is,
By congress'
posse comitatus act,
Precluded
from enforcing
civilian law
Outside the military
reservation.
Pussy communist?
I cannot provide you
with military
equipment or personnel
Without a direct order
from my superior
or the president.
I can give you
his address.
Sheriff Cyrus buelton
Has deputized
an additional 200 men
To help
apprehend the tank
Before it reaches
the Tennessee state line,
Apparently
its destination,
According to a cb broadcast
from sergeant Carey.
Now...
A tank is not
what you want to call
A fuel-efficient vehicle.
He ain't
driving a Toyota!
It ain't far to empty
on a sherman tank.
I'm putting one of you
In every filling station
between here and
the state line.
He'll have to
pump his own gas.
When that happens,
it'll be my pleasure
To shoot that sergeant
in his privates.
[ Dogs barking ]
Who's that out there?
Don't
make any noise.
I don't want
to hurt you.
I just
need some gas.
Okay?
You the one they talking
about on television
with that tank?
Maybe.
My sister had a boy
on that farm.
He never came back.
You're welcome to anything
you need.
[ Liquid pouring ]
All right, Mr. gant.
That ought to do her.
I thank you, sir.
Thank your wife
for her chicken.
You're welcome,
ma'am.
Best of luck,
sergeant.
Thank you.
Sergeant,
my wife's a
church-going woman.
She's praying
for y'all.
That's nice. Thank you.
Okay, you guys.
Finish eating.
We're going
to move out.
Now, a few words
about Mr. gant.
He has aided
and abetted escaped felons.
Normally,
I would arrest him.
I can't do that
Because those same felons
did destroy my jail.
However...
Long about tonight,
He'll wish he was
in a safe jail,
Especially if some of his
fellow citizens show up
To express
negative feedback
On account of his
helping escaped convicts,
Dope addicts,
and prostitutes.
Isn't that
an invitation
to violence?
Violence don't need
an invitation from me.
That from
sheriff buelton,
Clemmons county's chief
law enforcement officer.
Meanwhile, the manhunt
for the tank continues.
This is Ken billings
in the TV-9 skywatch chopper.
We were able to obtain
these exclusive pictures.
However,
we were spotted,
And the tank disappeared
into dense woods.
A tank should
be easy to spot,
But when Carey
doesn't want to be seen,
He evidently
will not be seen.
There you are, Jim.
Billy.
We got
them spotted.
He's headed
through that
thicket country,
Then into
them bogs.
He's heading
for the bogs.
We got us
a possum hunt!
If he doubles back,
Nobody will
give him any gas.
Not after what's
going to happen tonight!
My wife and kids is gone!
You want to try
and burn me out?
You go to it!
I'll tell you,
I'll take two
of you with me!
This is the tank.
You assholes
better move!
Thanks, Mr. gant.
You're welcome, honey.
Help yourself to
anything you need now.
Billy, here.
Take this.
I know how
you feel about me.
Nothing happened
between your
father and me.
We sat at the bar,
that's all.
Looks like
that was enough.
Nothing happened
because of him.
He just wanted to talk.
If he hadn't been there,
this wouldn't
have happened.
If he took me
out back,
Nothing would've
happened either.
If he would've
been like any
other guy with $20
That would've been
the end of it.
You should hate him
for not taking
me back there,
Or hate me for not
being sexy enough
to get him there.
You can
think of many
reasons to hate,
But your father
deserves better.
That's where
the sheriff
thinks you are now.
That's where
we would've been.
You'd have been stuck.
He's got 10 mack trucks
blocking the road.
How can we
get around them?
See that holler?
That'll take you out.
That's stump country,
but that won't hurt
that thing you drivin'.
They're not
in the bogs.
They must've
doubled back.
That pussy communist.
Hold on, you two.
We're going
for a rough ride.
[ Engine stops ]
Wouldn't that
just frost them?
What is it?
I do believe we
threw a track.
Start up the tank.
When Sarah says,
inch it forward.
All right.
Sarah, get back.
When I say it's okay,
Tell Billy
to move it forward.
Right.
Damn it!
All right...
Okay!
No!
Billy, he's hurt!
I think I've
broken some ribs.
Don't move, dad.
Oh, it's my fault.
No, it isn't.
Get the first aid kit
out of the tank.
Sarah, put this stuff
back in the tank.
I'm getting a doctor.
You're coughing
up blood.
You two
set out on foot.
Get me off
to the side.
I'm not leaving.
Billy, look,
it's like a war.
You lick your wounds
after the battle.
Horseshit.
I'm not leaving you.
I'm not asking you,
I'm ordering you.
You order soldiers.
I'm your son.
I'm getting a doctor.
No, Billy.
Look, the sheriff
will get all of us.
We don't have any choice.
Then we're all
getting out of here.
I can drive
this tank as
good as you.
I'll get us
across that
state line.
Billy, you don't
have to prove
anything to me.
I'm not proving
anything.
That's you
and Johnny.
I'm like mom.
Practical.
I love you...
More than
anyone on earth.
Can you
understand that?
You put your life
on the line
for me
For something
that wasn't
your fault.
Now you
can lean on me.
I love you, son.
I just want you safe.
That's all.
I know.
Let's get on with it.
Let's get going.
You okay?
You sure you
can run this thing?
He helped build it.
You better believe
he can drive it.
We're not going
to move by night.
We'll go on
the main road.
See that cracker
stop a tank.
[ Engine starts ]
16-year-old William Carey
broadcast an s.O.S.
His father was injured
fixing a thrown track.
William requested
first aid instructions.
Since the battle
of gant's farm,
The tank's crew
are becoming folk heroes,
Especially to
school children.
High school children
are holding up signs
That read,
"right on, tank."
And what does
sheriff buelton say?
These men
are criminals.
We're talking
about an escaped convict
And a man
wanted for assault
And a known...
Excuse the expression...
Prostitute.
These people
in that tank
aren't heroes.
But they do
have a tank.
The Bible says,
"might does
not make right."
That boy made
a serious mistake
When he came back
up on this road.
We're gonna stop him.
We know where, when
and how we're gonna do it.
This is fort clemmons.
We have Mrs. Carey
on the line.
How bad's he hurt?
Billy? Billy!
You have to
release the button
to hear him.
Mom, he's got some
internal bleeding.
You tell your dad...
You tell him
I'm sorry for
the stuff I said.
And I love him.
And I love you.
You're a pretty
good old broad.
Don't you die on me,
you son of a bitch.
Don't you
dare die on me.
This is Jason price
from the Georgia state line,
Where hundreds are gathered
with more every minute
At what will be
the finish line
Of the most bizarre race
ever run
I the tank
can make it.
We're with
ladonna Carey
At the Tennessee
state capitol.
Why didn't
the governor see you?
The governor said he
couldn't spare five minutes.
What are you
going to do?
I'd like to
ask every woman
To imagine that it
were her son and husband,
And phone the governor.
Ask him to
spare five minutes
Just five minutes
To a woman who's trying
to save her family.
I'm going to stay
here until he does.
State capitol.
State capitol.
Yes, he'll
get the message.
State capitol.
300 calls so far.
Who needs this shit?
I say yes, I'm harboring
an escaped convict.
I say no, then
I shot Jesse James.
[ Intercom buzzes ]
Who needs it?
Yeah?
Do whatever
you have to do.
And keep me advised.
State troopers office.
1,000 people
have gathered
On our side of
the state line.
Senators don't have
to deal with this shit!
Tell Mrs. Carey
I'll meet with her.
Billy!
Billy Carey!
This is Ken billings
of wgaz-TV 9.
We're above you.
You read me?
Loud and clear.
How's it going?
How's your dad?
Not too hot.
He's got
some internal bleeding.
Will he make
it across
the state line?
We'll make it across.
What will
you do then?
Will you surrender?
I won't let the sheriff
take my dad.
That's some kid.
That's some old man.
If he wants to make this
the last stand at the alamo,
then that's what we'll do.
Because we've got
a load of firepower.
We'll get
to the real law.
For a long time,
like every other kid,
I thought my dad
was wrong about many things,
But not anymore.
He doesn't have to
prove anything to me.
The bottom line is,
he's my father
and I love him.
If that sheriff
tries hurting him,
I'll blow him away.
[ Cheering ]
That little shit's
running for governor.
I have sympathy
for your plight,
But this is
a delicate matter.
I'm asking they get
a fair hearing
Before you hand
them over to buelton.
It's not quite that simple.
There are other
considerations.
What considerations?
This is a very
church-conscious
state.
I'm talking about
a Christian act
of justice.
In all candor,
I'd find it difficult
To put the prestige
of the governorship
Behind two men
in a tank
With a 20-year-old
prostitute.
Governor, that's
my husband and son
In that tank
with that prostitute.
If I have
no problem with that,
why should you?
We look at it
from different
perspectives.
Well, my perspective
has a dozen reporters
From every TV, radio station
and newspaper you can think of,
Waiting for me
to make a statement.
I'll either tell them
They have a governor
to be proud of
Who's willing
to see justice done,
No more, no less.
Or I'll say
their governor
is an asshole!
Which is it
going to be?
Are you threatening
the governor
with blackmail?
Yes, sir, I am!
Euclid!
Euclid!
Euclid, will
you come here?
Yes, sir.
Where's aavery?
He's coming right now.
You aavery?
Yes, sir.
Where did
you get that?
Sheriff bucks
loaned it to me.
He had it up
on his wall.
They tell me
you can shoot this.
Is that right?
That's all I did
in the army.
Here's the plan.
The tank will
come up this road.
He can't get
over those trucks.
He'll veer
off this road
Into this field.
He'll get
stuck in the mud.
That'll happen.
That's what I said!
When that happens,
You fire
to immobilize
the tank.
I don't care
if he can shoot.
I don't want
him to move.
Piece of cake.
Hit him in the track,
blow that track.
That'll stop him for sure.
Governor, have
you talked
to Mrs. Carey?
Yes, we have.
Have you made
a decision?
Yes, we have made
a decision.
If Mrs. Carey's
husband and son
reach our jurisdiction,
A complete hearing
will occur
In which we'll
examine the facts
Before extradition
is granted.
Where is
Mrs. Carey?
She's on her way
to the state line.
Where I'll join her
within the hour.
Hang in there, dad.
I think we're home free.
The governor will
fight the extradition.
Zack, Billy,
you've won!
All right!
We are ready!
Euclid, get them water
trucks out of here.
Everybody, get behind
this dirt ramp.
The road's
blocked with trucks.
I'm going around.
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Hold him there.
Hold him.
Now get him!
That's all right.
Don't be nervous,
squeeze the trigger.
But if you miss again,
it's your ass!
Keep going, son.
We did it!
We got him!
I'm happy as
a pig in shit!
Maybe you ain't
a faggot after all.
All right.
The game is over.
Come out
and surrender.
No!
No!
No!
Drop on it,
sheriff.
Get down, boys!
Down!
That betrays a negative
attitude, Billy boy.
But that's all right.
We got all the time
in the world
And we can wait.
[ Gunfire ]
Fire away, Billy boy.
We got a long day
ahead of us.
Just sit there and
enjoy the afternoon sun.
[ Helicopter approaching ]
Move those
people back.
Isn't there anything
they can do?
They've got no engine.
They gotta be pulled out.
What are you doing?
Stealin'.
When it gets dark,
You two go out
through the hatch
And slip
across the line.
I won't
let you die.
I'm staying with you.
Bill...
Sheriff.
If I surrender,
Will you get medical
attention to my father?
I hear you, Billy.
Yes, sir.
You give up now,
I'll see
your daddy gets
to the hospital.
You got sheriff
buelton's word.
What the hell
is that?
Cover me.
Shoot that hippie!
Let the governor
through.
Good old son of a bitch!
Goddamn!
Pull!
Everybody, pull!
Pull!
Pull it! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Shoot into
that crowd!
You shoot, and we'll turn
this into little big horn.
Stop them out there!
Come on!
Grab that cable!
Haul that cable in!
Pull! Pull!
Come on, governor!
Pull!
We've got to
try something else.
Follow me.
[ Cheering ]
Get those tables
out of the way!
Move it!
I got you,
you son of a bitch.
Come out of that tank
or I'll burn you out!
I'll fry you alive!
You hear me?
I'll pour gasoline
down that hatch,
'Cause you have lost,
sergeant, and I won!
Hook her up.
Hook her up!
We stopped
a sherman tank!
We didn't get no help
from the governor, army...
[ crowd cheering ]
Pull! Pull!
I'm coming, sheriff!
Sheriff...
You syphilitic
bolshevik!
You pervert!
You pussy communist!
Pull! Pull!
Come on!
Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
You did real good,
old girl.
