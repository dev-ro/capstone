NETFLIX PRESENTS
Hello, Mr. Max.
Yoli, how's it going over there?
Everything ready?
Yes.
Everything's packed and ready, sir.
One moment. Let me put Ander on.
- Dad.
- Hey, Tiger.
- You all ready to go?
- Yeah.
Uh, the guitar won't go back, right?
- I wanna keep it up front with me.
- Of course.
Listen, did you say
goodbye to your friends?
Yes, well, just David and Lucas.
All the other kids I know
aren't really nice to me.
Right.
Listen to me.
Your real friends, the ones you can trust,
can be counted on one hand.
That's not a lot of people,
and you'll likely have fingers to spare.
- So don't you worry about it, all right?
- Okay.
Just don't be late. Get here soon, Dad.
For how much?
He wants half a million.
- A year?
- A month.
Lucero just arrived.
You better stay here.
The Colombians already know us.
I can handle them.
Lucero!
There you are, son of a bitch.
Look at you.
You're exactly the same.
How are you, parce?
I'm good.
Hey, boys. Either of you smoke?
I saw your son.
We both think it'd be good
to combine the families.
It'd be best for my father to be the head.
And my son, Tomasín, will be treasurer.
Hmm.
So you like counting the money, huh?
You and Tomasín. Speaking of...
Here you go.
The Conclave will begin shortly.
I think your father
will get here any minute.
But first...
Cheers.
To a lot of money.
Papa San made the transfer.
I'll divert it to our secure accounts
and have 18 percent
deposited into your reserve fund.
Done.
As for Dimitri?
He claims that he'll back you
if the Colombians do.
Romeo is greedy at heart but reasonable.
Don't you think?
500,000...
a month.
Oops.
Tomasín!
I suggest you tell your boys
to put their weapons down, parce.
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, hey! Don't move!
Don't move.
Kill the bastard!
What are you waiting for?
Come get me, bastards!
Come on this way. Let's go. Stay down!
Yeehaw!
I hate that family. I told you.
You see? They can't be trusted.
Rafa!
Call my father.
Tell him Romeo backed out.
The Conclave was just a trap.
And now, let's spill some blood.
What do you say?
There's a problem.
Lucero!
The taste of death.
No, no, no!
Get up, you filthy rat.
I never could stand that guy.
- This wasn't the plan.
- No.
But he was going
to screw us over, and he lost.
- So what do we do now?
- My father's coming.
Can you talk to him?
Yeah. Don't worry. I'll handle it.
I know these things really bother you,
but he'll understand.
You better leave.
A new life is waiting for you, all right?
You've been like a brother to me.
Faithful to my family.
You deserve the best.
Thank you, brother.
I love you.
I'll miss you.
Yeah, sure you will.
Sunshine, beaches,
time with your son.
You won't have time to think about me.
Take care, little brother.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Max.
- Hey, finally, you're back.
- Come here.
- How about a hello?
- Hello. Come on! Show it to me!
Here you go.
Tiger, you're gettin' much stronger.
Yoli, it's important
that we return these to the owner.
Will you?
Thanks for everything.
You, get ready. We're finally leaving.
- Safe travels, sir.
- Thanks.
Take care, Ander.
Father.
How are you?
Bad.
I don't know what'll kill me first,
the cancer
or my son and his stupidity.
Max?
Where is he?
You were supposed to come here to pay,
not this.
Leave the last shot to me.
Listen, it was a trap.
They were gonna take me hostage.
And your buddy, Romeo, then he...
he was gonna take over the Conclave.
Really?
Yeah.
I saw him yesterday, and we made a deal.
I never got the impression
that he was unhappy with our agreement.
But now, what do you suppose
the Conclave will make of this?
- I'll disappear. What's the problem?
- You idiot!
You have no idea how this all works.
You only care if blood is shed!
Blood is necessary to make it work.
You think this is America?
This is Barcelona!
You can't conduct business
like that! Lucero...
Ever since
you came back from Japan,
you have become cold.
You don't care who lives or dies.
Lucero...
you're not my son, not anymore.
You made me leave.
Because I hoped
you'd learned the value of loyalty
and of hierarchy...
In the Yakuza.
Lucero,
your choices pulled us apart.
Yes.
So I've heard.
Go after María.
Cancel the transfers and clean-up team.
I want everyone to see this.
Your weakness puts us at risk, I'm afraid.
Lucero, talk to your brother and sister.
Let them explain it.
Well, María, you adopted.
And Max, you hired him.
He's an employee, but he saved your life
on more than one occasion.
He's been like a brother to you, Lucero.
You know he has.
Max is not my real brother.
Got that? He's not.
I'm your only son.
Your own flesh and blood!
But you were gonna leave them in charge.
No, I swear.
Your head, Dad, or your heart?
Tell me, your head or heart?
The head. In my head.
I can't find María. She disappeared!
Did you hear me play?
I've been working on that song
all day today.
Sounds great.
When I'm famous and on tour,
I'll dedicate this song to you.
This is for my Dad!
Hey, Dad?
What is it, Ander?
Dad, why is that man here?
Hide, Ander.
Ander, get down!
Know who your boy really reminds me of?
Huh?
My brother.
Remember him?
You should.
I remember my brother.
It was you who made Ricardo do it.
You got him kicked out.
You said he liked
spilling blood too much or something.
Finito, I didn't do anything.
Your brother...
Yeah, I know.
I know, Máximo, you didn't do anything.
Is that why he committed suicide in jail?
- Huh?
- Please, Finito.
He's my son.
Well, don't worry about it.
Look.
Tell me he didn't suffer.
Not at all.
It was peaceful, just like you asked.
Good work, Finito.
I knew I could trust you.
Sure you can.
TWO YEARS LATER
Daniela!
It wasn't my fault.
That took forever. Same bullshit.
- Sure, okay.
- Leo.
Come here a sec.
Come on! Let's go!
Leo, it better just be a minute!
- What's up?
- You got mine?
What was it? Twenty?
Yeah.
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, man.
If you had
all the money in the world,
however much you wanted,
what would you do with it?
Well, we always said we'd go parachuting.
Remember that?
I would buy us a huge island.
GARAGE
Hello?
Anyone home?
You see that?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hey, Grandpa.
Well, I guess the show's gone downhill
since they lost that host.
Here.
Leo, this is more
than you usually bring home.
Where'd you get it all?
I picked up more hours at this
new garage over in the Gothic Quarter.
- Yeah.
- It's near the plaza with the graffiti.
- What are you up to, Tomy?
- Math.
You'll have to teach me, then.
I completely suck at math.
If Grandpa sees you with his guitar,
he'll be mad.
How was it?
Today's your birthday.
Mom get you anything?
Mom gave this T-shirt to me today.
It's a cool present.
It's a stupid shirt. It's a dumb present.
Well, that's a bummer.
Because, actually,
I bought you clothes too.
I could return them.
No, no, don't.
No? Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Come here.
I knew you'd get it!
This is...
Leo, how'd you do it?
You're the best, Leo!
Hey, make sure to keep it hidden.
It's yours.
Hey, man.
Where are you?
And don't lie to me.
I know you're not out.
Where are you right now? The signal sucks.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm at home.
It's my brother's birthday party.
Bro, blow out the candles
and bring your ass over to the Charm.
The Charm?
Isn't that outside our turf?
It's not. Got a problem?
No, I don't.
That brat is here again.
Thanks, man.
Tell the boss it's the third time.
Yes.
Get off me!
What the hell?
If I see you dealing
in front of the Charm again, I'll murder.
This is your last warning, okay?
I need help over here!
Anyone, please! Hey, anyone! Help, please!
- Get your hands off me, dude!
- Quit.
You wanna mess with me, kid? Huh?
You want to die?
Get away from him.
You want a piece of me, asshole?
Beat it, or you'll end up like the kid.
I'd love to kick your ass too.
If I were you, I probably wouldn't.
That was badass.
Hey!
Hey, man!
Wait!
Hey!
Hey, man.
Look, I just wanted to say thank you.
That was amazing.
It was unbelievable.
I can see you.
Okay, dude. Well, thanks anyway.
Really. I'm going.
Look, man, I'm serious.
That was amazing back there.
Don't make a big deal about it.
Man, I thought my house was a wreck.
You really live here?
I don't live here. I live in there.
It's better out here.
Is that an authentic '73 Gibson?
Just mind your own business.
Shit, that really stings.
What the hell is that?
It's disinfectant.
Well, it hurts.
The disinfectant doesn't hurt.
Your wounds do.
Whatever you say.
You play it?
No.
It was my son's.
Well, it's a sick guitar. He's lucky.
Before he left, my dad used to beat us.
But I'm not angry.
I can manage on my own.
Everyone's gotta do
what they gotta do for money.
I'll be done once I build up some cash.
I'm planning on
doing some work for my cousin.
He makes so much money.
Yeah, whatever you say, kid.
It's a great guitar.
Bummer you don't use it.
See you later, Bruce Lee.
Hey, Dad.
Dad, why is that man here?
Hide, Ander!
Know who your boy
really reminds me of?
My brother. Remember him?
We only have
one chance to catch Lucero.
He's been
completely off the grid for two years,
but we finally know
what will bring him out of hiding.
The Conclave.
Shh.
Where's your boss at?
Oh yeah? I get it.
Papa San is where? Hmm?
Go on, ask her.
She's Chinese. I'm Korean.
We both speak different languages.
Okay.
All right. Arigato, everybody!
Turn off that music.
Let's see what we can do, okay?
Today in the Chinese casino,
in the "chinino"...
...we're bringing you a brand-new game.
A gamble with the truth.
I'll deal.
All right? I'll ask questions.
And if you answer correct,
you'll get a prize.
And if you don't, you'll be eliminated.
Any questions?
Let's begin, then.
Who knows where Papa San is?
Easy, right?
That make sense?
Miss, remember the question?
Where's Papa San?
Nothing?
Is that Mr. Miyagi?
Jesus. Professor Miyagi.
Huh?
Stop! That's enough.
Papa San?
What? You thought she was a man?
You're kidding.
Here, let's go.
Hello, old friend. How you been?
You look the same, huh?
You too, my friend.
I see that you're a coward still,
just like always.
You didn't even have the balls
to come here in person.
No, I was gonna come,
but I decided to take the time
to be with my family.
Charito, come on. Take her.
Listen, let's get to it.
I'd love you to back me now
as leader of the Conclave.
- I need to know I have your support.
- Your father was a true gentleman.
We had mutual loyalties
and mutual respect too.
But, you,
I will never back you, ever.
I swear I won't.
Then you can just consider this
a hostile takeover.
It was those Russians again.
I told you, they're bastards, man.
The Charm is a real shithole.
- You got my cash?
- No problem.
Dude, my money.
What happened to the cash?
That's all I managed to get.
It's because they took half.
If I say go to Charm,
you go to Charm, okay?
Okay?
Jackie Chan!
You're pretty shitty on guitar.
You want me to tune it for you?
When my grandpa is sober,
he actually plays pretty good.
It's cool, but he likes
more of flamenco or the rumba.
And I'll play anything except for that.
Then why don't you start a band?
You crazy?
What? And split the money with other guys?
No, forget about it.
Now we're talking.
Perfectly tuned.
And for free. No charge.
My name's Leo.
Max.
Max.
I can give you guitar lessons
any time you want.
And you can teach me a bit of...
We'd better begin, then.
Come on. Push.
Good. That's it.
Make sure to block.
Okay, show-off.
Block and strike.
Block. Strike.
You thought I'd be bad, huh?
No more, man.
I'm outta here.
That was awesome, man.
Call me, maybe we can do it again.
Later, Chuck Norris.
I need you to go
and make an appearance in Barcelona,
push things along with the Russians.
We need to provoke them more.
After what happened with Papa San,
the Conclave won't forgive me,
but I could murder Dimitri
and be the head of the Conclave.
They need to believe
we're defending ourselves.
They need to attack us first.
You can't do it.
- It's weird when you do that.
- Not like that. Like this.
- Hey, man.
- What's up, bro?
- Tonight, I need you back at the Charm.
- Okay, look.
- Someone else has to...
- Ah, ah, ah!
Tonight, that area is gonna be packed.
- It's a city fair. We'll make a killing.
- I'm not going back to the Charm.
Send someone else.
The Russians know
they'll be in trouble if they touch you.
Hold up. We're practically brothers.
I mean, we're family.
If they hurt you, then they hurt us.
Hey, that little prick just hung up on me.
Maybe I'll win the lottery, and that way,
I'd be able to help you stop dealing.
That piece of shit!
Dude, come on. Let's go!
- Look out!
- Hey!
He's over there!
I don't get it.
Maybe I'm crazy,
but I think you're avoiding me.
I didn't recognize you.
You didn't? You recognize me now?
Hey, look. Don't.
I heard that you pulled some shit
with the extra money at my expense.
I swear on my life.
Look, I promise.
I mean, I'm not like that.
- You... you heard wrong.
- Wrong?
Okay.
Maybe this is where
you hid the money, then.
Cut it out, man.
Come here, you little prick!
Wait! Wait! Don't do it!
If I say you're going to Charm,
then you go to Charm.
Got it?
I hoped that would actually work.
Have you seen Leo?
Why are you asking me?
Well, because you're pals.
At least that's what he told me.
You saved him from the Russians,
didn't you?
I'm not sure what to do.
I'm worried something happened.
No one has seen him.
And because he was stealing money
from Jaro, I don't know.
Well, if you happen to see Leo,
tell him to call, okay?
You're pretty strange, no?
I HEARD YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
WHERE ARE YOU?
So?
That bastard Jaro smashed my hand in.
Closed it in his car door.
What did you expect?
- You were stealing his money.
- But I had a right to.
It's hard with how little they pay.
My family can't afford rent.
I can barely support them.
So I robbed them.
It wasn't wrong though.
Would I do it if my dad was here?
No, maybe not.
But I don't have a choice.
You need to go to a hospital.
Are you crazy?
If we go to the hospital,
they'll call my family.
You don't wanna
bother my mother with this.
She loses it when she gets mad.
Don't mess things up for me.
Who are you calling?
Wait back here.
- Thank you. I know this wasn't the plan.
- Exactly.
I mean, the Conclave is next week.
What the hell is this?
He's been distracting you. That kid...
Leo.
His name's Leo.
Just go get him. I'll deal with it.
Hello.
And you, stay focused.
Let's go. Watch out for the bike.
Is there a problem, buddy?
Let them through.
Dimitri doesn't want trouble.
They're Lucero's boys.
Get a bunch of
bottles of Jäger. Find me the good shit.
I need just a minute.
You got a problem?
I'm into ladies.
And young guys.
You calling me a faggot?
Do you know who I...
I don't give a shit who you are.
Hey!
Help me! Get this guy off me!
Hurry up!
Máximo?
Why do you all know him?
Where are you going? Just help me! Hurry!
You want cash?
Is that what you want, man?
- Who's your boss?
- What?
Kick his ass! Goddammit!
I won't ask you again.
You hear me?
Who's your boss, huh?
Okay, okay, okay. I'll spill!
His name's Urquiza, okay?
His name is Urquiza,
but don't mess with him.
I'm telling you the truth.
Don't mess with him!
You don't tell me what to do.
Please, stop! Stop!
Please, no more. Stop.
Stop hitting me, you idiot!
Where is he at?
Where is he at?
You think it's funny
to keep repeating everything?
- Tell me where your boss is.
- Okay, he's at Seven Rain.
That's where he works.
I don't know where he lives,
but he works there.
Did you know the kid played guitar?
I don't know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
His entire hand was completely smashed.
Are you seriously leaving,
you piece of shit?
Now, do you get it?
You crazy old bastard!
Leo!
Please, it's Leo!
Please!
Put your hands there.
I don't get it, man.
Are you his dad or what?
He's just some stupid kid.
- Look, prick, put your hands up there.
- No, please.
No! My organization is big.
They'll come after you.
Do you hear me? They'll come after you.
No, please! Stop! No, don't!
Tell them when they come
that I'll be ready too.
Where is he?
His hand is bandaged, and I gave him
something to help him sleep.
You feel like training?
Ready for me to beat you?
So did you find out anything
that could help us?
That kid works for people
who wanna screw the Russians.
What happened to our plan?
You're gonna risk it
for someone you don't even know?
María, he's a kid.
That kid
is distracting you from our plan.
We've discussed this a thousand times.
We have to remember this is our last shot.
The Conclave.
There's a date.
He'll be there.
It's been two years of waiting.
I'm not pushing it back again.
It's our only chance.
If he succeeds, and he's pardoned
by the families, it's over, Max.
Stop worrying about me and train more.
Let go.
You're hurting me!
Cut it out, María!
The guy who is ruining Dimitri,
he got a name?
Urquiza. You know it?
No.
But I'm on it.
If they saw you and they work for Lucero,
then we probably should leave.
My father's reserve fund is almost empty.
Jesus.
My God. I see you provoked them,
and it worked. Well done, Jaro.
- The Russians had nothing to do with this.
- Is that so?
It was this dude.
- He was a total asshole.
- I bet he was.
Towel.
One of the kids I used
to provoke the Russians
apparently has a, I don't know,
a father, an uncle, boyfriend.
Don't you have
a boyfriend who protects you?
Listen, this prick is a combination
of John Wayne and Bruce Lee.
Beat the shit out of us without blinking.
John Wayne and Bruce Lee.
He's one of them Jaro? He's Russian?
- He wasn't Russian, I swear.
- Shh.
This guy came for me
because I beat up some prick-ass kid.
Doesn't make sense!
Kid was stealing money from us.
He was stealing our money.
Can you believe
that one of my men just disappeared?
He ran away.
Towel.
Maybe he knew him.
It's possible, I guess.
I mean, he knew the man's name.
So then he did know him, Jaro.
Come on.
Uh...I don't remember.
Hmm. It was a name
like in that movie with all the Romans.
- Spartacus?
- No.
Who the hell is named Spartacus?
Not that one. The other one. The good one.
Gladiator.
What's his name?
Jesus, what was it?
- Máximo.
- That's it. Máximo.
Máximo, prick.
That was "Natikillah" by Nathy Peluso.
Tell me where the kid's at.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.
Kid, if they're looking for you,
they're probably waiting there for you.
I know, but I'm not gonna
hide here forever.
Thanks for everything.
Are you gonna do something
or what?
DO NOT GO UP OR DO ANYTHING
UNTIL WE ARRIVE
Great.
Hold on.
- Got a little brother?
- Yeah.
He's always watching cartoons.
- Wait, I'll go in first.
- Max, relax, okay? Take it easy.
Trick or treat?
Happy Halloween!
Thank you!
Hey! You made it just in time!
Oh God!
Well, then, you're Leo, right?
I was just talking to your mother now.
She was telling me about your new job
at the garage in the Gothic Quarter.
What have you done?
You bastards!
You!
You were supposed to be dead.
Like your brother or like my son?
Leo!
- Don't do it.
- Just move, Max.
- Please don't, Leo.
- Get out of the way.
Put the gun down. Look at me.
I'm serious.
- Let him go.
- I'm gonna let him go now.
Look. Okay, I'm sitting now.
Down.
- The kid was the perfect excuse.
- Yeah.
Because if the Russians murdered the kid,
the Conclave would understand.
Lucero would say it's self-defense.
And Finito?
Did he see you?
Yes.
I couldn't finish him off.
I can't believe you.
You screwed our entire plan.
Once Lucero knows you're alive,
he'll bring backup.
We won't stand a chance.
Or even worse, he won't show up at all!
Do you know what you've just done?
How could I be such an idiot?
They're all dead because of me.
Leo.
Leo. Take it easy.
No, no, no. You don't get it.
Don't pretend you understand.
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
It hurts. It just hurts.
I can't explain it.
Leo, they killed Max's son
two years ago.
They killed my father too.
I completely understand.
That same pain destroys you
and rips through you every day.
A pain that won't let you forget.
Max.
When I pulled you out of
that house, all I felt was pain and anger.
I couldn't believe
we'd been betrayed like that.
But...
I think now it might be best
to find a new plan.
Let's disappear, find another place
to regroup, Max...
or quit.
Besides,
the kid...
the kid is all alone.
We don't quit, María.
I managed to hack Urquiza's phone.
Perfect.
Actually, it's not that perfect.
Apparently,
Finito is on his way to your garage.
He called for backup
for a surprise attack. They're coming.
Did Finito tell him who I am?
- No.
- I knew it. He's too cocky.
He wants to handle it
before Lucero finds out.
- We still have time.
- Okay, I'm working on a plan.
There's only one plan.
I'm gonna kill them all.
- Hello.
- Hello, Dimitri.
Long time since we spoke.
It's important
I speak with you.
The garage burned down.
We need to move faster.
How about Urquiza?
From what I could gather,
Urquiza manages a club downtown,
Seven Rain.
It's actually a cover for all of
the money laundering Lucero's doing.
Urquiza is a typical drunk
who has his hands in the register.
Rafa turns a blind eye
because he's his friend.
But Lucero thinks he's an idiot.
Ugh, and this guy
has terrible taste in shoes.
María, what's the way in.
Max, the best way is the back alley.
Excuse me.
Sorry, sir, you can't park here.
Hey, man, we're closed.
Take it around the back.
You scratch it. You pay for it.
Didn't you hear the new guy?
He said we're closed.
All right, so Seven Rain.
Beat it.
They have a turnover of
ten million euros a month, except today.
They're expecting a delivery
of 98 million euros from Lucero
for the Conclave.
That's some steep price for peace.
I'll pop by
and join them for a drink.
I'm guessing you know who that guy is?
It's a big operation.
There'll be lots of guards, about 18.
Six of them by the main entrance.
Six inside.
And six more
that will be guarding Urquiza.
He's over there!
He'll be in that back room.
That's where the money is kept
and where it's counted.
How do they do it?
They go in as delivery men
with lighting equipment for the parties.
But instead of lights,
the boxes are full of bills.
They're instructed to deliver it
personally to Urquiza in his office.
Simple and silent.
How long do I have
before the van arrives?
You have about 20 minutes.
Shit, shit, shit!
I'll send a message to Lucero
that will make him crawl out of his cave.
Wait, Max. Why don't you come here
and we'll make another plan?
Where are you going?
No, no, no!
Lucero, you know who he is.
I have a message for him.
You'll deliver it.
You. Empty that container.
Put it into my trailer.
Hurry!
You sure?
Do it.
I can't do it.
Rafa, he was an animal.
Rafa, an animal.
Wanna drink?
Explain this to me.
I don't understand.
Was this all the Russians or what?
I just do finances.
I just do finances.
I don't know, Rafa.
This guy came. He didn't look Russian.
I don't know.
He... he came in here and killed everyone.
He had this message for Lucero.
- A guy who was...
- One guy?
Guy just came...
One guy alone?
One guy alone, Rafa. I'm... I'm...
Cut it out.
He was...
What message did the prick have?
He... he said, "your heart"...
No. "Your head or your heart."
No, "your head or your heart."
"Your head or your heart,"
and he gave me this cell phone.
This cell phone.
He plans to call in precisely 24 hours.
Lucero has to pick up.
Lucero here in Barcelona.
The part that's worse,
the guy somehow knew
where the cash was in here.
Rafa, will you
help me explain this to Lucero?
I can't do it.
How do we tell him about the money?
Huh?
Lie down.
- What happened to you?
- It's nothing. Don't be upset.
This is nothing? It's a fractured bullet.
You'll need a sedative to get this out.
Max, what's with the money
in your trailer?
Screw sedatives.
I'd better get my message to Lucero.
They'll be looking for us.
Great. Look, this is going to hurt.
You never take me seriously,
yet here I am.
Who's coming after you?
Do you know what's going to happen?
They'll murder you.
Only I won't be here.
What's going on between you two?
Stop being kids about it!
I hope that shuts you up
for a while.
The next one's all yours. I'm done.
How's my favorite Russian?
Good. You?
Just landed.
You in Barcelona?
Yeah. It's beautiful.
Are you broke?
No, please.
Those are rumors. That's bullshit!
I'm telling you it's fine.
See you in a few days.
Goodbye.
Did that prick really say
"your head or your heart"?
I can't be sure.
Urquiza promised that's what the guy said.
I'm not pleased.
Get in the car.
It's worse. The guy took all the cash.
I just blew out the candles
for my daughter's first birthday
on FaceTime.
And I'm here with you all.
I planned on being there.
But here I am.
It makes me so...
Upset?
Pissed off.
Lucero!
- Lucero!
- Why is he tied up?
You guys can't handle him or what?
Unbelievable.
Hold this.
Why is there all this black plastic
underneath me?
Back away.
Ninety-eight million just disappeared,
but no big deal.
My reconciliation with the Conclave?
- I better figure it out.
- I know together we will find a solution.
Yes, but in exchange...
I need every detail, everything about him.
The color of the prick's hair,
the color of his skin too, his eyes,
what kind of nose he has.
It all. Pisses standing up
or sitting down. And be specific.
You can see it recorded
on the CCTV cameras.
Black and white. A typical man.
Had a big beard. His eyes were...
I don't remember. He's a typical guy too.
He went crazy. I just...
He got into the Porsche
and took your cash.
Put your cash in the trailer, and then...
But I didn't say anything.
Please, I messed up!
What you're gonna promise me
right here and now is this.
There will be no more
saying anything to anyone.
No, no.
Hmm?
Never.
Well, that's it. All sorted.
No, no, no...
No, no, no, no...
- What's that?
- It's for cutting out your tongue.
No! No, no, no!
Then my friends here
will take you to the hospital, sew you up,
get you back on your feet.
I don't wanna.
Just, please don't say that, Lucero.
I can't. No, please.
"No, please?"
- No, but what?
- Lucero, you can't do this to me!
But you could use my money?
Let that asshole break in here
and steal 98 million from us?
Be a man, at least!
I deserve respect!
Do you remember what that is?
Give me that!
- No! No!
- Open up! Open! Open it!
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
Open!
He... he struggled too much.
It's in... I stabbed his eye.
Is this the phone?
Come on. Give it to me.
You had it for too long.
There.
Bring my cake.
And where's Finito?
He said he's coming.
He said you had problems with Jaro.
You hungry?
There are a few loose ends,
but everything is under control.
What's your problem?
Cruelty makes us weak.
It makes them respect me.
They fear you. They don't respect you.
Fear is enough for me!
Do I look weak to you?
Is that it?
There is no honor without respect.
Don't give me that!
I don't believe in codes
or any of that bullshit.
That was what killed Máximo.
You killed him.
You killed him and his son.
He was weak.
Weak for having a son?
Where is he?
The big guy, the one with the ponytail?
Dammit!
Tell me, or I'll pull the trigger.
You talking about him?
What do we have here?
What are you looking at, huh?
Huh?
Why are you here? Huh? Why are you here?
Listen up, kid.
I don't know what you hoped to find,
but I know what I want, punk.
Máximo. Hmm?
Where the hell is he, huh?
Come on. Answer, please, Leo.
Who's this, Finito?
- It's personal.
- What does that mean?
It means that it's personal.
Beat it.
Max will murder you.
Max? I thought you killed him.
Murder you.
I'll take care of it.
Are you kiddin' me?
Let me see.
Jesus.
Hey, kid, hang in there.
Just hold on, okay?
We'll be there soon.
Pick up, Max.
This way.
- You told me he was dead.
- Because he was dead.
You swore he was, Finito.
I heard you bragged about doing it.
Apparently, you killed him barehanded.
Because I burned the place down.
I don't know how the hell
he got out of there alive.
But he did, didn't he?
Now all he wants is revenge,
take back his honor.
Let me take care of it.
We'll see.
It's time
to speak to the Conclave.
But it needs to be in person.
I'll ask for their support
and their protection.
You'll be okay
lowering yourself like that?
All right, get out of here. Come on.
Hello.
Dimitri.
My friend, how are you?
Good, and you?
Fine. Listen to me.
I'm in need of a favor.
It's complicated,
but I know you'll be able to help me.
Last night they tailed them
to Hospital del Mar.
They're still there. What now?
Pick up.
Please, leave your message after the tone.
Listen, I'm at Hospital del Mar, room 512.
Leo went to find Finito last night,
and he got beat so badly
he can hardly breathe.
My old friend.
Ex-friend, you mean.
I always thought
that it'd be you leading the Conclave.
A leader with values, with morals.
You're a traitor.
Abandoning Ricardo like that.
You left Lucero as our only option!
You never should've left.
It was supposed to be your Conclave.
You screwed up everything.
And Lucero, who never accepted you,
he's made our lives hell because of you!
Where is Lucero?
It's too late.
He united the Conclave
and is now under their protection.
And how will he pay them?
I have his money.
Don't worry about that.
I'll be bringing that back.
He'll be untouchable after the Conclave.
Lucero is taking over.
You're finished.
Thank you for the information.
Nobody seems to be here yet.
I'm sure they're coming.
Everyone to their posts.
You steal my money,
murder my guys.
Show your face, you piece of shit!
Have some honor.
Do it!
You have one new message.
Max, listen.
I'm at Hospital del Mar, room 512.
Leo went to find Finito last night,
and he got beat so badly
he can hardly breathe.
I think it's time we quit.
We've dealt with this shit for two years.
And for what?
They have destroyed Leo's family.
And they've destroyed us.
I can't stand watching you die again.
I'm taking Leo with me.
Far away from all this endless violence...
before it destroys everything that I love.
I hope that
you come with us.
I'll talk to you later. Think about it.
Sorry.
I thought I was gonna die.
I told them where you were.
Don't worry about it.
I'm still here.
It's brave what you did.
No, it wasn't.
That guy
burned through everything I loved.
And I couldn't do anything to him.
What good is being brave?
If you hadn't been there at my house,
I promise
I would've killed him right there.
I know it wouldn't bring back my family.
You should really be resting.
It's best you let him sleep.
But maybe I'd feel better.
Maybe I would.
Lucero.
Lucero. Lucero.
He's here.
Come on up.
He's expecting you.
Watch out!
The brother
who came back from the dead.
I'm not your brother, you prick!
About time
till you accept it.
No, we're not brothers, but my father...
my father loved you like a son.
You killed my son,
and now I'm here for you.
You see, Max, you'd be with him.
The plan was to finish you too.
Only you abandoned him.
We'd murder you too
so that you could go together.
I didn't abandon him.
No one else determines my destiny.
Your destiny has been determined.
It was from my own father.
He chose this for both of us.
It's ironic.
My father was annoyed
because I wanted to be just like him.
As time went by, he began to fear me.
But you were perfect.
He respected you, Max.
I'm not here to discuss Ricardo.
I'm here to kill you.
Be ready to spill some blood,
little brother.
Well done, little brother.
At least you don't
drop the katana anymore.
Those little Buddhas
taught you well.
One more?
One more.
Please. Hey, Max.
It seems you were right about honor.
I have none.
Finito!
Look who came to see us.
Hey, María!
María!
We're finally together as a family.
Come on.
Come here.
I don't recognize you, Máximo.
I don't recognize you.
Finito, go on and redeem yourself.
Do it.
Come on, sis.
The second time is the charm, you prick.
Stay over here.
Don't try anything.
Rot in hell, you bastard.
Your head or your heart?
Just spare the lives of my family.
Like you and your men
spared Leo's family, Lucero?
You're pathetic!
Hey, sick ride.
No, really.
But it's pretty small, don't you think?
I'll be in the back seat.
But don't expect it
to be this way every time.
There's a hierarchy, just to be clear.
Leo, did you say goodbye to your friend?
Well, yeah.
Friends are everything.
Aren't they?
UNKNOWN NUMBER
Yes?
My dear María.
I was waiting for your call.
Not for you to run off.
Are we good?
What about you? Are we okay?
You know we diminished the Conclave.
The Conclave is tomorrow.
The only thing I did was set a time
and place for your meeting with Lucero.
You did?
I never thanked you
for calling me that night to save Max.
It was very useful.
- What's up?
- I was thinking we could...
Yeah?
What's with this dumb romance
between you guys, huh?
Can you, please,
just wait till we're there?
Okay? Is that too much to ask?
It's just weird for some of us
in the back seat.
