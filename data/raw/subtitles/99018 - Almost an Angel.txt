That's all we got.
Could you at least give us the height, build?
I told you i dont know, if a big star

Comes up to your window
and puts a gun to your face
um you'd get confused too...
- i got a good a realy good look at him.
- Oh yeah?
Didn't like his last album very much.
He does'nt like love songs.
Pretty good if you like love songs.
- You talking about willie nelson

Yeah, but why would rob a bank?
- Well that's it if you heard the album!
- That's not fair come on.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I thought his last album was pretty darn good.
Dont touch him, call an ambulance!
I did'nt see him.
He came out of no where!
He saved my babies life!
He's a hero.
This man is a saint...
who is he?
I thought he was asleep
i was just covering him up
i didn't know about any
possible complications.
He's chart doesn't say anything,
its a bit late to start panicking nurse,
this man is dead, dead, dead...
checked him at 6:30 he was fine.
Its not your fault!
These things happen he propobly died
a few minutes after your rounds
by the feel of him he's been dead for hours
for hours, for hours.
You want the truth i'm giving it to you.
I'm an angel, i'm an angel, i'm an angel...
i'm dead aren't i?
Were the hell am i?
Are you god?
Your not a religious man
are you mr dean.
No but, i did plan to get very religious,
just before i died.
- You know, just in case?
- Yes.
- Left it a bit late didn't i.
- A hum.
Let me put it into a language
you'll understand!
Your on probation mr dean,
think of me as your probation officer!
Probation officer, sure!
I've been through your sheet mr dean,
you have a criminal record
that started when you were 9 years old!
Yeah, well i dont suppose i can lie to you sir.
- You can try.
Your almost a mystery.
In your entire life you did nothing but take.
Yet in the end you gave the noblest gift
you gave your life for another being.
Well it seemed like the
right thing to do at the time
rubbish! It was instinct!!
You'd have time to think you would'nt have done it.
Never the less.
Your intinct has,
earned you another chance.
Probation mr dean.
How does that work?
You will go back, dedicate
yourself to helping others.
Giving not taking.
You will become an angel of mercy.
An angel?
Me?
Probationary, strictly on a trial basis.
You will not speak of this incident to anyone.
Your honour,
does this happen all the time when people,
get sent back to help out?
From time to time,
worthy people are chosen,
to be angels of mercy.
But these are difficult times mr dean.
In this century your the first scumbag.
We've sent back.
Scumbag?
That's a bit much innut?
Scumbag?
Hey pop!
Was anyone in here just now?
Only death my boy.
Only death.
That explains it!
I'm in the nut ward.
Nobody move!
Get your hands up were i can see them.
You people!
Get down on the floor now!
I said now! Fill the bag,
the bag stupid!
Look its rod stewart.
Rod, rod!
Sign this to nancy with love".
Rod: Put, janet,
"last night was great".
Lets go!
Walk out this door,
and your dead.
Stay calm, nobody move.
He's running, he's running.
I put three holes in him,
and he's running!
I could'nt have missed him?!
How did he miss?
How did he miss?
- I shot him, you didn; t miss
i knew you'd flip out if anything went wrong,
so i loaded your gun with blanks, blanks?
44 magnum,6 inch barrell
could'nt have missed.
Should have blown my head off.
Could'nt have missed.
Did'nt miss
passed right through me.
I'm an angel.
Jesus christ! I'm an angel.
Sorry.
I'm an angel...
you can't kill an angel.
Fly...
aerobics.
Like jane fonda.
Holy water right?
This proves i'm not a vampire.
Did you think you were my son?
Oh no, i saw that holy water trick on son of dracula".
No, i've got a real life problem father.
Come along with me,
we'll talk it over.
Well i've been up all night,
i've been up all night talking to your boss.
And checking out your book,
i could'nt find any answers in there!
So i thought.
So i thought the best way to get the inside data...
was to ask one of you holy joe's.
- That's why us holy joe's are here.
- Good.
Do you know about angels?
I dont mean the ones with the
long white dresses and wings.
I mean like angels of mercy.
You know that ones that come back to
earth and do good deads and stuff.
You've been visited by one of those angels right?
Nah.
I'm not supposed to tell you this but,
as you know about angels its ok.
I am one.
Your an angel?
Well almost, i'm on probation.
I'm bullet proof but i can't fly yet.
God did'nt choose you to,
save the world from,
evil politicians did he?
Nah.
To help the needy.
And to give instead of taking.
Same as your caper right.
Problem is um,
i'm not realy cut out to be a bible basher.
Oh! You dont have to be a preacher to serve
the lord my son.
You see were all given different gifts,
use those gifts in gods name,
even if your gift is that of a simple carpenter.
It's all there.
- Ok, but where do i start?
- Well, oh helping the needy?
Well their not hard to find.
Look around.
Oh i'm sure that god will give you a sign.
God give you a sign to get into this racket?
I believe
god called me to do his work.
- God spoke to you?
- I believe he did.
Hey don't you reckon he looks
just like charlton heston?
- For the needy father.
- Oh im sure the needy will appreciate it.
Oh just one thing...
i wouldn't go telling
anyone your an angel.
That's exactly what our boss said.
No sweat.
Please dont let him try
to fly off the top of a building.
(music playing)
Sounds of david! Right.
Hey buddy.
- You got a few dollars for some food?
- You mean drugs dont you, pal.
This is america.
People dont beg for food.
Where have you been the last few years?
Yeah fed the starving multitudes.
Fed em on loaves and fishes...
bread and fishes,
do as i say,
no one gets hurt.
I'll have 200 tuna on a roll to go.
- Paper or plastic?
- Ah i hate it when they ask you that.
In what everyone assumed was a pr excercise.
The bonzo's burger man cruised
the downtown area last night
distributing samples of his products to the homeless,
it now appears he obtained his samples.
At gunpoint
but thanks to an accurate description of the hold up man
police expect an early arrest.
He's medium height, medium build,
and looks like this.
This is cindy miamoto for channel 8 news
thou shall not steal.
You know the ten commandments?
- Your not going to preach at me are you honey?
- Oh no.
I was just wondering do you think they might be flexible?
You know like for a worthy cause.
Well, there's one commandment
that would be flexible as far as i know.
That would be the one about adultary.
I'm sure god will give you a sign.
Moses.
A sign? Moses, moses!
Moses shall lead them out of the wilderness.
Hold it.
- Hey man whats your problem?
- You got some death wish or something, calm down.
- I need a lift to where ever your going.
- 200 bucks?
- Hey come on my man, right this way.
End of the line.
Take it easy now allright.
Thanks joe.
Yes sir, draught thanks.
Hey,
- sorry steve
- clumsy fool, .
Come on i did'nt see you.
Dont mind him sometimes
he gets a chip on his shoulder.
Where i come from someone
would soon knock it off.
Yeah but he's a cripple.
Its being a cripples is like being a dwarf.
- Hows that?
- A guy i knew tiny hollis.
This high, shot three people,
cause they treated him like a dwarf,
killed a man with his short legs.
You gonna move?
You rude to everyone
that's not stuck in a chair?
No.
But if you were stuck in this chair...
i'd punch your lights out.
That sounds fair.
Chair.
Come on,
hey take it easy.
Hey i dont need any help on this.
Hey that's enough.
No, let him go, let him go, i started it.
Hey come on steve.
Your a cripple.

What do you see?
I see a man in a wheelchair.
Acting like a jerk in a wheelchair, huh huh.
Jerk in a wheelchair?
- Can i buy you a beer?
- Nah, but i'd love a scotch.
Steve garner, professional jerk
terry dean, part time jerk.
Hey terry so where you staying tonight
anyway hah?
I though i'd check out the motel
i saw down the corner.
Na na your staying at my place tonight.
And dont argue with no poor cripple.
Ah okay but dont worry.,
cause you dont see a cripple here do you
just a man who happens to be in a wheelchair.
Make that a pig in a wheelchair.
Which way. This way follow.
Hey i dont need any help,
i'm as strong as a bull.
I know that i was just helping you balance.
Thats what i like about you terry?
Your such an asshole.
Thanks.
You dont live by yourself do you?
Nah not since these legs gave in,
i had to move back home.
My mum and my sister they live in the main house,
but i got my own spare room in the back
it's my own pad and everything.
You'll be okay.
What did you do before this happened?
I drove a truck, stole a few bases.
And i chased a lot of girls.
- You got a girl now?
- Nah.
There seems to be something
about me thats putting them off.
Do you think its my haircut?
Nah,
more likely its your deodorant.
Are you kidding,
women go crazy over this stuff.
- . They do! It said so on tv
- well then they must be right.
Come on steve.
You met him in a bar.
Anytime your friends from the city visit.
Their perfectly welcome to stay here.
Mom were not talking about
some old buddy from highschool
yeah your right sis,
i had so many buddies dropping by lately,
- i lost track,
- that's not the point steve.
Its not like you and it's not right to
bring home a complete stranger in the middle
of the night like that.
Terry is not just some drifter.
Rose like the guys got money,
he lives in la.
He's got a house in la,
a big house.
- He's just on vacation.
- I so him reading the bible earlier.
Anyone who starts the day with a good book,
can't be too far off the track?
An axe murderer can read.
Hello!
- Just in time, sit down terry,
- thank you.
Got to feed the body.
Well as the soul.
Won me mrs garner.
So! You have family living in la mr dean?
No, not living. There all dead.
I'm sorry.
I killed them with an axe.
Iook i'm sorry. But ah
its perfectly normal for you to
wonder what im doing here in your house?"
Its just i was planning an easy wandering vacation
anywhere away from the city.
And went into a bar and some
ugly jerk picked a fight with me.
Steve came to my rescue.
Here i am.
No he came, you came to my rescue,
i'm just returning the favour.
The guy was a jerk, but whe was not ugly.
And what is your vacationing from
mr dean?
Oh claustrophobia mainly.
Well i work in electronics.
- Really?
- Pass the sugar? Please rose.
You know we've got broken video games
down at the rec centre.
Maybe if you've got some spare time
you could come down and have a look at them.
Hey rose the man is on vacation.
Right?
- Damn rec centre!
- Alright, its ok.
- Does this rec centre got anything to do with the needy?
- It certainly does.
Rose and steve run it.
If it was'nt for them the kids would be out on the street.
Doing drugs drive by shootings.
Ma this is fillmore,
we dont even have walk by shootings!
What we do have,
is a lot of latchkey kids in the area.
The centres the only place they have to go,
till their parents get home.
- In tha case i'd be delighted to help.
- Thank you.
Thank moses.
You know those video games
are in bad shape, pretty complicated.
No problem., they used to say about me,
that i could eat batteries and shit.
Shoot out electricity.
Some coffee mr dean?
Video's on, alright, why!
Hey you want to play doubles or?
That's amazing!
You know these machines were donated
to us because they just about had it.
That's true,
well i guess you are what you said you were?
- Yep, - uh hum.
Can i apologise and start over?
Thanks, my pleasure.
Just uh using my gift to help the needy.
- Anything else i can do?
- Yeah!!
You can teach these kids how to box.
I know you can do that.
Why not.
Well he seems alright!
But he does talk kinda wierd.
- Yeah he were born in australia.
- I did'nt mean the accent.
Never mind.
- I wanna play,
- hey i'm next.
- Hand speed boys,
- very important to you in life.
When i was your age!
My hands were so fast.
I could steal your socks,
without taking your shoes off.
Now the left hook?
Very important when you throw the left hook.
Keep that elbow up high.
Know why. Because if you miss with the glove,
you can still take
em out with the elbow
i'll tell you what an elbow will
open up an eyebrow better than any glove, i.
The reason i'm telling you boys this
cause thats the tricks
that dirty fighters get up to.
Now i never ever wanna see any of you
guys doing any of this dirty stuff.
Okay come here and help me with the bag.
Put your hands down.
First rule, never trust anybody,
- you sure that's him father?
- Thats my angel alright.
It does'nt add up. This much cash
usually means a drug deal.
- That does'nt go with dean at all.
- Then he is'nt a crook?
Is the pope a catholic.
No offence father.
Dean is a born thief.
An old fashion pro if you will.
Too much pride in his
trade to get involved in drugs.
He specialises in security systems, safes, banks, uh.
Hey, bill!
What was the take on the state bank
the willie nelson job?
They estimated 67,000.
62000?
He took a wad out.
I think we can cancel apb
on willie nelson?
- Hey kid,
- what do those guys want?
- There just asking about the place.
You know how many kids come here
stuff like that, gotta run?
Hi steve.
Who's this guy?
- He's got cash.
- Check it out.
Let me guess boys.
Social workers right.
Yeah and what's it to you? Popeye.
Free samples to start the ball rolling eh?
And dont move,
or i'll have to hurt you real bad.
- What we do call the cops?
- We can't call the cops.
We'll call the family.
Cover me, trust me.
What? No no, vinny. No we cant waste em.
We've got orders.
If they move you can shoot em in the legs.
You know you enjoy that.
Just the legs, vinny.
Gerrido! Yeah we got em.
No their not carlotti family.
I knew the carlotti's would'nt come into
our territory.
Their like a couple of small time
freelance punks to me.
What do we do with em?
Mad vinny wants to waste them.
Check with the conciliary.
We'll all stand by.
No tony, trigger happy.
Graci, ciao.
Vinny!
Good, good.
Lucky day pizano's!
- Get up! I've seen you before, i know you,
- shut up and listen, watch it.
On my signal, you walk back to your car,
walk calmly keep your hands in plain sight.
Drive out of town,
never come back.
Have a nice day.
Oh!
That's yours.
Ah, no it's not ours.
- We dont need it.
- Suit yourself.
Dont even look at it.
- I could have grabbed the gun.
- Dummy that's what they want you to do.
There's like a dozen scope sights on us,
right now, i could feel it!
Oh shit, you know this guy from somewhere?
County jail.
He used to run with real heavyweights.
- You mean like hitmen mafia, like shit?
- Yeah.
He's names dean... something dean
- dean, dean, it does'nt sound italian.
- No so what's dean martin, polish?
Oh yeah, yeah,
the guy at the bus stop!
Ah the truck across the street,
the car!
Get in the car,
just get in the car keep your hands up, okay.
Hurry.
Alright! Get in.
Heh heh, run you dogs.
Hey there going to have to take their
pants straight to the laundry after this.
Me too! I think!
- How did you know how to handle it?
- Oh i saw that in the godfather movie".
Hey bullshit terry.
I trusted you, trust me.
Yeah, i owe you that?
You spend enough time in the sewer.
You get to recognise the other rats.
I did time with scum like that.
A lot of time,
anyway that's all in the past.
You religious steve?
You know about god and angels,
and miracles and stuff?
Ah yeah, i think i've prayed
for my share miracles and stuff.
Well i got one,
a miracle.
God gave me another chance
brought me back to life.
So that's it your a born again christian?
You know about that?
I mean born again?
Jesus christ... sorry.
A priest knew about that too.
You religious people know
how to keep a secret!
Part with the gun, back there offering it
back to them, that was pushing it a bit?
Yeah but did you notice?
I kept me self between you and them.
But they could have shot you!
If you know all about me born again
as a you know what,
you must know i'm bullet proof!
Of course, and can you leap over tall buildings
and dissemble bombs?
Fly? Not yet?
Well for a devout christian
you throw a pretty mean punch.
Ah yeah, but that's allowed.
In the bible were jesus found all those dealers on the steps
said cast them down,
you know, belt the shit out of em.
Monica and daphne stay
outta the fridge!
What are you two up to?
We were just having a bible discussion.
Oh great!
Good practice for the cocktail party tonight.
At the beilmans.
Oh terrific, an evening of grovelling with the bible thumping beauman
oh come on their alright.
Besides if they dont help us out.
This place is history were broke remember?
Oh god, all i can do is
sit trying to looking tragic.
Why dont you ask terry here?
I mean if the conversation turns religious,
it could realy open their eyes
with some of his interpretations.
I think we've taken enough
control over terry's life.
No!
If i can help i'd be delighted.
And if it involves a free drink and
the company of a good looking woman.
Then that's a bonus.
So dont worry, i scrub up okay.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
- Rose does'nt have a man?
- Ah, nothing serious.
She'e too hard to please,
she finds too many faults.
And i keep telling her she'll never
find a saint in fillmore.
Aah, you never know.
- What you?
- Yeah.
Yeah, i guess you could do worse...
think ah! Jack the ripper or freddy kruger...
- what?
- Jason from friday the 13th...
what about you mr buttface?
- You have an eye for quality mr dean?
- Yes, maam.
Early mexico parish.
Really in these days.
Well i guess were ahead of our time.
- Don't picked that that up years ago.
At a garage sale.
- A garage sale?
Phew, that would bring,
100-150 thousand dollars today.
Realy?
Are you in the art business or?
Oh no, ah. Used to be a removalist.
Oh well when your in the business of,
transporting objed-art you get to know the value.
For insurance purposes.
Oh well i guess were fortunate that most thieves
dont have your background mr dean.
- Pardon?
- We had a burgler in last year.
Did'nt touch that,
took the vcr and the stereo.
- Ah it these times mrs beilman
you dont even get quality burglers
- oh hah hah hah excuse me.
I think you do a wonderful job rose.
And i wish i could help,
but i've already made a considerable
commitment to support reverand barton.
Who is on the air right now, will you excuse me.
Hey, hey its on now.
To be in the service of the lord.
Is a special calling.
- Rose, how did it go?
- Not good.
I think it went better with mrs beilman.
Ah she was probably impressed with steve's jacket.
I've be kinda avoiding this rose but,
what exactly is wrong with steve?
- He did'nt tell you?
- Boths kinda avoided it.
I know he thinks that
it might scare me away.
But it wont.
He has a malignent spinal tumor.
- Does it mean he's dying?
- Yeah.
He never said a word.
First few months he cried, yelled.
We all did...
then he just sort of, accepted it.
He was always a tough kid.
- Damn...
- i dont suppose theres any treatment or?
- No.
I'm just hoping he does'nt suffer too much,
too long.
That's why the rec centre
was such a godsend.
Helping those kids took his mind off it
made him feel usefull?
Here it comes!
I dont usually name, names but it is people like,
brother daniel ruffles
and brother george beilman.
Ah ah, who show there genuous
and continuous support.
Help keeps this ministry alive.
You can see he hates that recognition.
How can i compete with that?
I dont have my own television show.
People believe in tv dont they.
No why dont we join our hosts inside.
I need a drink.
Give your love to the old,
the infirm,
give it to the children.
Alright, i dubbed those peices close as i can.
- Works pretty good.
- So will this.
It should transmit 20-30 feet
that cable.
You know terry i dont want to pry,
but a guy with your flair for electronics
could earn a 100000 dollars a year, .
- Legitimate.
- 100000 a year?
I earned close to 100 grand my last job.
Took 20 minutes.
How long was your last stretch?
Five years.
Okay so i'm good at this stuff.
Could'nt never do maths for shit.
So i say to you,
i dont want your money.
Give it to the children.
What in the name of god was that?
Oh the switch,
what, the remote control switch
i probably rolled on it.
George, it's on top of the set.
It's not plugged in.
It cant possibly come on by accident.
There's no power in it.
There's power in it george.
The power of the lord.
He spoke to us.
The reverand barton spoke to us.
Its 2:30 in the morning dear.
The reverand barton comes on at 8pm.
And besides,
i never heard your reverand barton,
suggest giving money to anyone else.
He said give to the children did'nt he?
It was a message from god. I know it.
What children? We dont have any.
Needy children i suppose.
Rose's children!
Rose asked us for help,
for the recreation centre.
Nah i just dont know.
- The lord via television?
- You say it yourself all the time dear,
the lord works in mysterious ways.
I'd better call rose tomorrow.
I was planning to make a contribution
to the centre anyway.
- For the children...
- of course you were dear.
George... (snoring).
George.
Um, i'm too excited to sleep
do you feel like playing ride the wild horse?
Maybe tomorrow night dear,
my back has been acting up a bit.
I consider that a raincheck then.
Goodnight dear.
Goodnight, irene.
Terry!
Shit, what are you doing here?
I was worried about you,
how did it go, did it work?
What a charm.
You nearly gave me a heart attack,
thought i was busted!
You know how embarassing that would be for me.
Three hours in the house without
no loo, i'd be a laughing stock.
Yeah it would, what about me, i'd be known as the
slowest gataway driver in history. Yeah.
Car!
Get down!
Its exciting
its kinda being like in vietnam.
No it is'nt.
Yo terry! I know i'm your getaway driver,
but do you mind giving me a little push?
Oh sure.
Get back, i dont want to catch anything.
- Did you hear the one about the paraplegic
who tried to swim the english channel?
- Nope.
He had to turn back because
his ears got tired.
Thats funny but its in bad taste innit
no only if you say it.
I'm allowed.
- Ah when like all the kids at the rec centre call you
the road runner?
- Their allowed.
- Kids are realy straight aren't they.
- Yeah their pretty cool.
- They think i'm a jerk.
- Yeah well terry kids call it like they see it.
Thanks. You know what your gonna be
when be pass a big stairway?
A test pilot.
Hey this is no cab.
I just read this witness statement.
From the west hollywood bank job.
Lady swears one of the cusptmers
was rod stewert, so?
- This is hollywood...
- yeah but rod stewerts in england.
Besides this guy ran out of
the bank right behind the gang.
Maybe even with them?
Rod stewert, willie nelson, terry dean...
i dont know.
Sometimes these leopards change their spots.
Sold to gang jobs, nah!
Maybe he's smarter than we thought,
maybe! I doubt it.
- Come on i've been waiting for hours,
- i've been waiting for weeks.
Well i've been waiting for years,
its my turn.
Hey, hey, hey i'll solve this...
have you kids heard of the
wisdom of solomon?
No. It's my turn, wait a minute.
You see there were these two women,
fighting over possession of a baby.
And king solomon said,
cut the baby in half
and give you half each.
- Yuck!
- So, so?
What if i take this paddle,
snap it in half and give you half each?
- That's a realy dumb idea.
- It's stupid.
Now, you see the real mother said,
dont cut the baby in half,
give it to her.
And then solomon knew
she was the real mother.
Your weird terry.
I wanna play space invaders.
It's my turn on that next.
Your supposed to say give it to.
I guess there's a fine line between
wise and wierd...
no, no mr beilman whatever times
best for you, terry!
Tomorrow night, sure no,
no problem at all.
Thank you.
Guess what? Mr beilmen wants to
come here,
to check out the hall,
to see what we need.
Old george is coming through.
Well that good news.
I somehow get the feeling that your
involved in mr beilmans coming here.
Me no, i hardly spoke to george
i'm just gonna go and.
Check on steve, he's been in bed all day.
He's been getting tired a lot quicker lately.
Oh he'll come good he's a fighter.
- When's george coming round?
- 8 o'clock tomorrow night.
See ya.
Hey rose, come judge which ones best.
It would'nt hurt to give
george another push, a sign!!
Like the burning bush.
No been done.
Yeah 8 o'clock tomorrow night.
I can set it up tonight.
Hey. Boss sometimes you
make it too easy.
- Hey steve, got any batteries?
- I dont think so...
let me guess, beilmans are in for as re-run?
No. I've got something special in mind for george
need some help?
Not on this one. Definitely a solo job.
I'm not gonna ask you what your doing.
But i would like to know why?
Why are you so intent on helping out?
That's my job,
helping people who need help.
- Are your parents very religious terry?
- Nah.
Devout aethiests from memory.
Anytime i went into a church as a kid.
I used to knock off the poor box
well i was poor.
- What changed you?
- God.
When he gave me this job as a...
when i was like you said, born again.
God told me that...
well he told me not to talk about it.
- You just have to trust me steve.
- Yeah i do.
I dont know why but i do.
I'm afraid your faithfull getaway driver
would'nt have been much use anyway.
I seem to be getting low on gas lately.
Yeah well get a good nights rest sundance,
leave this one to old butch.
Terry... next time your talking to god
- do you think you can put a good word in for me?
- You got it!
Dont know if it'll carry much weight though.
Last time i talked to him
called me a scumbag.
He's really no scumbag? Just!!
Now he's got me doing it...
hhe's got me doing it.
I'm not trying to tell you, how to do the job but!
Steve deserves better than me.
He deserves a proper professional idol.
I'm not even sure this is how to help him.
You haven't give me a sign.
Jesus christ!
Sorry about the blasphemy.
Was'nt my fault though.
Just forgot i was immortal okay.
Besides, if you'd have given me the wings,
would have made the job a lot easier.
Think about it!
Omnipresent.
Everywhere at all times.
So that's how you knew about all,
those crimes i committed.
Everytime i did the wrong thing
you were there.
Ah! I'd like to explain about that
weekend in los vegas with,
froggy franchettis wife,
and his mother in-law,
- they were both in the jacuzzi...
- good!
I was hoping to catch you alone.
- I need your help, terry.
- Ah sure!
Oh a favour. Oh you got it.
Ah, firstly i'd like to thank
you about steven...
i know his condition has'nt improved but,
he's really perked up
since you came along,
the kids got ball's ah, guts mrs garner.
More than most of us i'm afraid.
You know its terrible to watch your
child dragged down by illness,
worse when its both of them.
- Rose has'nt got it?
- Oh no not physically.
But when steve got sick she,
turned off her life.
And gave up a good job in public relations
and all her friends in the city.
And came home to help him.
I know she loves working with the children,
but she's still young and attractive.
- She should have a fuller life.
- Yeah i know what you mean.
Um, do you find rose attractive
terry?
Yeah, i reckon your daughters
a real class act mrs g.
Good. Then why dont you
make a pass at her?
- Invite her out.
- Do anything,
i was gonna do that but,
steve siad she'e pretty fussy.
I know i'm not exactly off the top shelf.
Being fussiy is just an
act for stevens benefit.
A woman should to be told
she's attractive, and desirable.
Otherwise she ceases to be either.
Remind her!
Put a move on her...
you have her mothers blessing.
Oh for gods sake dont tell her that.
I'm a lone wolf mrs g
i'm not looking for any ties.
But i'd be delighted to put
a move on your daughter.
As a favour.
Not sure that rose will be that thrilled though
oh dont worry she's well aware of youi.
Has she said something?
Um she takes off her glasses, fixes her hair.
Whenever you are around says enough for me.
- Is tonight too soon?
- Ah the sooner the better.
Terry...
i think your a class act yourself, yeah!!
Hey did you hear that, class act!
Hope your taking notes.
Hi rose, hi!
Just preparing for the royal visit are you?
I was just trying to clean up a little bit
i guess a dumps a dump. Yeah
i still dont understand why, mr beilmans
seems to have changed his mind about helping us.
Ah you know what they say rose:
The lord works in mysterious ways.
Rose, could i take you out to dinner?
I mean just to so to celebrate george
coming through on you.
It'll be a little premature to celebrate.
Ah oh yeah but, ah yes...
i'd love to have dinner with you.
You would? Great!
- I'd have asked you sooner only ah...
- only?
I guess i figured you were
way out of my league.
Its probably the nicest thing.
Anyone ever said to me.
8 o'clock.
I gotta meet george out the front.
It's dark, you know.
I dont want him to flip over and
break his checkbook do we?
Mr beilman, terry dean we met.
The other night.
Ooh yes of course with rose.
I thought i'd better lead you up there sir.
It's quite dark round here certainly is.
Thank you.
There are some light about but ah,
except for the rec hall,
the power round here - was disconnected years ago
my god! Its obvious theres power
here somewhere - beg you pardon!
- The light?
- On the cross!
- Where abouts?
- Did'nt you see that the cross all lit up.
Oh the old church.
You got better eyes than me mr beilman.
No it was bright it was glowing.
Ah must have been the light of a passing car?
Or something, i can guarantee there's
no lights in the old church.
Went through it yesterday
trying to scrounge anything for the kids hall.
Not even a light bulb.
No there's no power
in the old church.
Except maybe,
power of the lord.
I think we got him.
Were a good team you and me.
Listen mate...
oh i guess you've been asked
this question, million times but...
is elvis with you?
Sir, detective freebody
robbery division lapd
- whats the problem officer?
- Were looking for a good friend,
mr terry dean.
Got a tip he was around these parts.
Dean, dean... nah don't ring a bell.
- Whats he wanted for?
- He's not wanted for anything.
We were just hoping that,
you may be able to help us out.
Yeah, he has been in here
picked a fight with stevie garner.
Thats the darndest thing i've ever seen...,
cause steve's a crip; he's in a wheelchair.
Then they drank together allnight.
Try asking stevie. He's here now.
He should know.
He just left, huh huh!
Check around the back.
Mr garner - police officer!
Damn!
Beaten by a guy in a wheelchair.
Very funny!
Not nesessary my boy
my path is brightly lit.
Oh well good night then mr beilmen.
Goodnight.
Goodnight indeed.
Nah, quit while your ahead.
- Well how did it go?
- He's not gonna fix up the hall.
- What?
- He's gonna build a new one!
I can't wait till we tell steve.
- I dont think i even thanked him
- i reckon he knows your grateful.
You said the lord works
in mysterious ways,
but i have a feeling, the lord had
a little extra help on this one.
- Well he's a busy god.
- Thanks.
Well! Why dont you buy me that dinner.
And maybe fill in a few blank spaces
mystery man,
me i'm no mystery rose.
I'm about as deep as a teaspoon.
Somethings wrong.
Stevie whats wrong?
Look at you!
Oh your bleeding, gangs and bottles.
- A broken town?
- In town?
How long ago.
A long time,
i'll call an ambulance.
Keep that bandaged tight.
Terry, 2 cops their looking for you,
they know where i live.
You gotta go. Shit!
We'll get you fixed up first.
I must have cut a vein.
You know they say you bleed to death
- in 15 minutes.
It's been a lot longer.
Terry, i'm dying...
and i'm scared.
Yeah, i know.
But there's nothing to be
afraid of. Trust me steve.
This is'nt the end,
this is just the beginning, i know!!
How you know, how can you know?
Cause you gave your life for another,
that's the way i died.
That's the noblest way to go,
god told me that.
God told you, god?
Yeah god. God sent me back,
to help you, rose, the kids,
help the needy.
But you your not a scumbag like i was.
No probation for you,
where your going you can forget the chair.
You'll be able to run the 100 in 9.5.
I'm only a probationary angel.
Your gonna be the real mccoy.
I know it,
do i know you believe,
then i want to,
but i'm scared.
Cant you let this kid know,
it's gonna be alright
please god give us a sign,
to let him know i'm telling the truth.
Oh god!
Thank god...
hey sis...
- i'll run the hundred in 9.5.
- He'll be fine rose.
- He just looks so young.
Steve's with god now.
I know that for a fact.
- You really believe that dont you?
- Yeah.
God gave me a sign.
This is'nt powered by god, terry.
- Just batteries.
- I dont need batteries rose.
God told me to me to do that.
Terry i heard what you told steve
and i'm glad he believed you.
- But you can't expect, rose...
- look at me.
I dont wear funny robes
or carry signs around.
I'm not a religious nut.
I just help people.
Like you do.
I dont think i'm an angel.
I dont think i'm an angel rose.
I know i am.
I've gotta go now.
Now? You just gonna walk away?
I have to go.
There are things i have to do.
But god said i can come back,
if you want me to.
I want you to.
I will come back.
I promise.
I cant tell lies. I'm an angel
well almost...
i hope i was right about him
running the 100 in 9.5,
any slower than that,
he'll be after my hide when i see him again.
Terry!
Holy, jees...
i'm cool,
i'm getting used to it.
Indestructable right.
I'll be back!
Steve's with god now rose.
