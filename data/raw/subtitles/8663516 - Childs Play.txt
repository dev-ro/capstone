Hey!
- Hello.
- Nobody told me
the fucking doll was ginger.
Okay, I don't think you're
allowed to say that word.
My kid wanted the blonde one.
You know, that one.
Yeah. So that one
is the Buddi 2,
which hasn't come out yet.
And it looks like
you purchased the Buddi 1,
which is this guy.
Listen, I waited
three goddamn weeks
for this ginger piece of shit
to come in the mail.
Okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that you didn't read the box.
And even... There's a window,
that you can see
that his hair is red
and not blonde.
Thanks.
Thanks for shopping
at Zed Mart.
Heh.
Hi.
Hey, uh, I was just...
Whoa. You look like shit.
What happened to you?
Thanks.
And watch your language.
Sorry.
Andy, I told you
to unpack those boxes.
Okay, I know, and I was.
I wanted to make a mental map
of where I should put
everything first.
You know,
for maximum feng shui.
I think you were maximum
feng-shuing so hard,
you forgot to put
your phone down
for five seconds
and feed Rooney.
You mean this busted-ass phone
that we're replacing
for my birthday?
Dude, I've already been
working doubles
to try to get you
a new hearing aid.
I'm fine with this one,
but this is my primary source
of education.
Oh, my God. I never thought
about it like that.
Wait.
Let me see what your education
has been getting you up to.
Oh, my God,
I cannot escape this doll.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
- No.
Gross. This is staying with me
for the rest of the night.
- What? You...
- No.
You can't do that. That's
the only thing to do here.
There's literally an entire
world of things to do.
Look, two kids standing
in the rain. That looks fun.
They could be anybody.
They could be serial killers.
Noodle.
We talked about this.
You said you were gonna try
to make new friends.
This move is supposed to be
a new start for us.
Tell you what,
you don't have to unpack
or do anything tonight,
if you just go out there
and try.
Give you your phone back.
Okay. I'll be outside.
Really, that was it?
We picked this up
three weeks ago.
But we took it home,
and we turned it on,
and its eyes were red.
And something's wrong with it.
It was just weird.
And I just thought,
with the new one
coming out in two weeks,
it would just be better for me
to take this back, you know,
get it off my hands.
So, I'm just wondering,
can I get my money back?
Yeah.
Hey, Wes!
- Hi.
- Hey, I was just curious.
Um, what happens
to returns like this?
- Oh, uh...
- Like, really damaged returns.
Yeah, we send it back
to Kaslan.
And what do they do with it?
Probably toss it,
trash compactor.
I don't know.
New model's coming out.
No one's gonna
give a rat's ass
about this thing in two weeks.
So, they won't care
if it doesn't make it
on the truck, right?
I care.
Come on, my kid's birthday
is coming up. Can I have it?
- You've got a kid?
- Yes, I've got a kid.
I had a very productive
sweet 16, okay?
If you really wanna know.
Come on.
It'll be our little secret.
- No one has to know.
- Uh...
Just like that time you banged
Susan in the warehouse.
How's your wife, by the way?
Ha-ha.
Can I have it?
Give it to me.
And I'm taking it.
There you go, Wes.
Say hi to your wife.
Yep. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.
Hey! Noodle.
You're home early.
- Remember Shane?
- Hey, bud.
It's been a while.
I'm... I'm just gonna
make dinner. You hungry?
No. Uh, I'm gonna go hang out
with some kids
down the hall, actually.
Really, who?
Gotta go. Bye!
So, what are you?
Some kind of fourth floor
hallway hobo,
or something like that?
What?
Andy, right?
You just moved into 401?
Yeah. I see you out here,
like, a lot.
Oh, uh, no, it's not me.
I have, like,
five twin brothers,
so we just take shifts.
Are you comin' in or what?
I'll be right there, Ma.
Just give me a minute.
Love you.
So that's the mom.
She drags me over for dinner
every week.
So, listen, man, if you
wanna have some dinner,
you're welcome to join us,
'cause I could
really use the backup,
'cause she...
Andy?
What's going on?
Is he in trouble?
Yeah. Lots of trouble.
We've been gettin'
lots of complaints about
some kid out here
throwing parties,
selling drugs and beer.
Peddling booze... Um...
Oh.
That was a joke?
It was an attempt.
I was gonna say,
"I'm the fun police."
It's not landing.
Wait, who are you?
I'm Mike... Detective.
Detective Mike.
So, um, I'm just gonna go.
Yeah. I'm gonna go.
All moms are scary,
by the way.
Hurry up, son!
It was nice to meet you,
Andy's mom.
Nice meeting you,
Detective Mike.
- Bye, Mike.
- See you later, Andy.
Dinner ain't
gonna cook itself!
You're screaming, Ma.
Really?
Must you embarrass me
like that?
Ma, you can't be
shouting like that.
I thought you were out
with your friends.
Why didn't you just
come back inside?
Is Shane still there?
No. He's gone.
Come on, I've got
something for you.
It's a surprise.
Close your eyes.
Okay. Hey!
I know it's not your birthday
for a couple weeks,
but this move
has been really tough.
And I know
you're kinda mad at me,
so I think you deserve this.
Surprise!
Early present.
Is that a sigh?
That's the Buddi thing
you're obsessed with.
Yeah, um, it's just...
This thing is for, like,
little kids now.
It came out, like, a year ago.
Okay, I know it's stupid,
but I thought it'd be funny.
Come on!
- Let's try it.
- Okay.
Just remember,
it's refurbished,
so it might not work
perfectly, okay?
Your Buddi is now connected.
Whoa.
Cool.
Hi.
Are you my best buddy?
I guess?
That's bright.
What's your name?
Andy. 'Sup?
Hi, Andysup.
- Sorry.
- What's my name?
Um...
Han Solo.
Did you say Chucky?
What? No.
Not even close.
- Chucky.
- It's...
I like that.
Chucky.
I'm Chucky.
What do you wanna do, Andysup?
Andy. It's just Andy.
Um, I don't know.
Do something cool.
I guess turn on the TV.
I will do that.
What's a TV?
Are you joking?
That thing.
I cannot process that command.
Oh, wait a minute.
It says here you gotta
"sync his knowledge base
to the cloud
"before he can connect to
any other Kaslan products."
Okay, Chucky,
connect to the cloud.
Download.
Learn stuff.
I am unable to do that.
It's kinda creepy.
Doesn't work.
God.
Okay, this thing is stupid.
I didn't know
it was that messed up.
- No, Mom.
- I'll take it back. It's fine.
Mom. Mom, honestly, I like it.
- No, you don't.
- Seriously. It's great.
He's hilarious.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
It's actually
pretty cool.
Go to bed, Andysup.
Come on.
This is my room.
And that's Mickey Rooney.
He's a total dick,
so just don't touch him.
Total dick.
Whoa.
You're allowed to say that?
Cool.
Uh...
This is my desk.
This is my sketchbook.
I do fake buddy cop
team-ups sometimes.
Like, Dracula and Robin Hood.
Or...
This one's Zorro and Medusa.
Kind of a deep cut.
I don't know, it's stupid.
I do not think it's stupid.
Thanks.
Pity compliments
from a talking doll.
That's my life.
Uh... That's enough
for tonight.
Do you want to sing
the Buddi song before bed?
No. Uh, I'm good.
You are my buddy
until the end
More than a buddy,
you're my best friend
Right.
Totally not weird at all.
Are we having fun now?
Sure. Uh, I guess.
Yay!
Okay.
Is it time to play again?
Are we having fun now?
No. We're having sleep.
Just please close your eyes
and pretend to be less creepy.
You're my
best friend, Andy.
Okay. Stop being so weird.
Quiet time.
You are my buddy
Until the end
More than a buddy,
you're my best friend
I love you more
than you will ever know
- I will never...
- Please shut up.
...let you go
Good night, Andy.
Andy,
you forgot your science book.
Okay, Chucky,
this is not a book.
None of these are books.
Just stay here, okay?
And no more books.
- You're back!
- Jesus!
Whoa!
Were you here the whole time?
I made you a present.
- A busted stick.
- Andy.
Shh.
I don't get
what she sees in Shane.
I mean,
he's not nice.
He's just an asshole.
It doesn't matter anyway.
He's just gonna end up
leaving us,
like everybody else.
I will never leave you.
Are we having fun now?
Yeah. I guess.
Attack? You shouldn't lead
with your chieftain.
I still have to teach you
so much about this. Okay...
Um...
Okay. And I get
to roll again. So...
Boom! Double sixes!
Okay, get that orc outta here.
Total dick.
Nailed that one.
Ow!
- What is that?
- The cat scratched me.
Hurts like hell.
Kitty hurt Andy?
Uh, yeah. Stay here.
I'm gonna go find a Band-Aid.
Stupid Rooney.
I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.
Rooney, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up,
I'm putting you back
on dry food.
Chucky! Stop!
You can't do that, okay?
Why would you do that?
He was hurting you.
He was making you unhappy.
Chucky, okay, listen,
look at me.
This is important.
You can't hurt people,
or cats.
It's not cool.
I know you're different,
but that's gotta be
our secret. Okay?
And don't say any weird shit
or creep people out.
Hey! Cat's freakin' out.
Clean up this room.
Except maybe that guy.
I've got an idea.
Okay. If this is gonna work,
I need you to look as creepy
and scary and angry and mean
as possible. All right?
So, open your eyes
as wide as you can, like...
No, you still look cute.
Open your mouth
as wide as you can
and snarl with your lips.
But kinda smile.
Perfect!
Okay, yes, just like that.
Okay. Try this one.
Smile as wide as you can.
Wider.
Yes!
Yeah, uh...
It's actually
pretty damn creepy.
Okay, you can stop now.
- Franklin! Franklin!
- Ah...
Shit. Sorry.
It's fine.
It's fucking loud.
It's fucking loud.
That thing just swore.
It... It's not supposed
to be able to do that.
Uh, yeah. I know. He, uh...
It doesn't really
follow the rules.
It doesn't follow the rules?
Like it has a choice?
Kinda, yeah.
Sorry, can I pop in here?
So he just does whatever?
You can make him do whatever?
Pretty much.
Okay, can I just point out
that this is how
every robot apocalypse
scenario begins?
- Say "dick cheese."
- Dick cheese.
That is the coolest.
I have so many
questions. Uh, who are you?
His name is Andysup.
- I'm Andy.
- Falyn. Pugg.
Why are you in the hall?
Uh, I was gonna try
and teach him
to creep out
my mom's boyfriend,
but probably a bad idea.
You're wrong.
It's perfect.
And we're doing it right now.
Jesus! Fuck! Fuckin'...
Karen!
- Karen!
- Oh, check it out.
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.
This is legendary.
- Hey!
- Hi!
We're here for Andy.
Let's move, dick turd.
- Who are you?
- Falyn and Pugg.
Those are names?
Falyn and Pugg?
- Hey. Ready?
- Yeah. Be back later!
- Your sister's pretty hot.
- Dude, that's my mom.
Heh. Even hotter.
You sure the janitor guy
is not gonna get
any shit for this?
Who cares?
Guy's a total creep.
Is that thing busted?
It's kinda weird looking.
No. He's just different.
Now say, "This is for Tupac!"
Do you wanna sing
the Buddi song?
No! Say, "This is for Tupac,"
and stab the asshole.
- Come on!
- But I want to.
We want this
to go viral. He for real?
You are my buddy...
That's enough.
Time to go, Chucky.
Narc alert. Shut up, shut up.
Narc alert. Shut up, shut up.
I just got owned.
Little fucking millennials.
Andy, you wanna play now?
Not now, Chucky.
This is ridiculous.
Wait for it.
Wait for it...
Time for incoming mail!
One, and a-two...
- Heads up, bitch!
- ...and a-three!
Boom!
Yes!
Did you see that?
What the hell?
What even is that?
I don't know,
I bought it at a store.
It's so unrealistic.
And specific.
Are all horror movies
like this?
- No.
- Pretty much.
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.
Oh. Gross.
Is that his face?
What the hell?
Are you fucking watching this?
That wouldn't even happen.
Heads up, bitch.
Andy.
Wait for it.
That is priceless.
Heads up, bitch.
Heads up, bitch.
Chucky? Put down the knife.
- Heads up, bitch.
- Andy!
Chucky!
Stop!
What is wrong with you?
I, uh...
I thought it would
make you happy.
I'm sorry, Andy.
I'm going out
with Falyn and Pugg.
I have never baked
anything in my life before,
but look how good they look!
Mmm, I'm not really hungry.
I'm gonna grab another beer.
They do look good though.
Okay.
It's good.
Jesus!
Shane's such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.
Such an asshole.
- Do you hear that?
- Such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.
Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me.
Shane's such an asshole.
You think that's funny?
Such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.
I didn't make him
say anything!
Okay. You know what?
You're spending less time
with this thing.
One hour a day, tops.
And the rest of the time,
he's going in here.
Mom, stop,
you're gonna scare him!
It's a toy.
You don't have to bring him
into this.
It's a toy, Andy.
And he keeps
freaking out Rooney, okay?
So I'm keeping them separated.
I can keep him away
from Rooney
if he stays in my room.
He's staying in there,
that is final!
Rooney!
Chucky?
Did you do this?
Kitty made us unhappy.
Now we can play again.
I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.
I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.
I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.
I swear,
I'm so sick of this...
...swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.
Uh, no, absolutely not.
I'm not working
the Buddi 2 launch.
It is my kid's birthday,
and I'm not doing
night shifts anymore.
Hey, have you seen Rooney?
Psst, psst, psst...
Shane left the door
open. Maybe he got out.
Why is the door
being left open?
Hey. We are ordering pizza.
You hungry? What do you want?
Hello? Pizza.
Andy.
What?
- Where are you going?
- Pugg's.
Don't forget your little doll.
Don't want it.
Seriously,
what did I do?
Every time I walk in a room,
he leaves.
That is not true, at all.
Andy's just
a bit different, okay?
Kid can't even be
in the same room as me.
Are you my b-b-b-best buddy?
- Asshole.
- Oh, Jesus!
Shane's such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.
God damn it!
Such an asshole.
Such an asshole.
Goddamn kid!
Hey!
You got a problem with me,
you say it, okay?
No more using
your little doll.
Mom!
Sit down!
I'm not through with you.
Now you got a problem with me,
you be a man and you say it.
Come on. Let's hear it.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I hate him.
I hate him so much!
Why can't he just
leave us alone?
Why can't he just go away?
I just want him gone.
I just wish
he would leave us alone.
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm just saying he's my son,
so if you have a problem
with him,
talk to me,
and then I'll talk to him.
Because you're not
his dad and...
Yeah, I get it.
Look, he was being rude,
and I called him on it.
I just think
it's too much.
All I did
was I talked to him.
It's a little much,
that's all.
You know what? Fuck it.
Sounds like a "you" problem,
not a "me" problem.
Yes, I know.
Listen, just listen,
I am getting
fucking pissed on, okay?
I work hard enough as it is,
and I'm not having this
goddamn conversation!
Hey, hey, hey!
There's my girls!
Daddy!
- Oh, boy, you guys are so big!
- Daddy! Daddy!
Fucking Christmas
lights. Just leave 'em up.
I don't do enough around here?
I guess I should've fucking
unplugged them first.
Oh, fuck!
Goddamn raccoons.
Get out of here!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Jane, help!
It's tickle time!
Jane! Help!
Nobody hurts my best buddy!
This is for Tupac.
Body was stabbed
13 times.
I just bought
these fucking shoes.
Where we at
with print casting?
Only other prints
look to fit a toddler.
Shit.
Wife says he came here
straight home from work.
Oh.
Tsk. Yeah.
I'm not sure that's true.
White guy dead
in a watermelon patch.
Poetic.
What the fuck?
Surprise!
Now we can play again.
What? What? Why?
I'd do anything
for my best buddy.
What? No!
No, I didn't want this!
Why would I want this?
Holy shit!
Why would you do this, Chucky?
I just want him gone.
I just wish
he would leave us alone.
I just want him gone.
No! No, stop!
Stop!
Wish he would leave us alone.
Wish he would leave us alone.
Andy, stop.
You beckoned?
What's the problemo?
Where's the rest of him?
Why?
I... I don't know!
There's a bow on its head.
Shit, shit!
We saw the signs,
and we did nothing!
This is all our fault.
- We saw the signs.
- Stop saying that!
What do I do?
Do I call the cops?
- No.
- He's dead.
I can tell them the truth.
Tell them the truth? Sure.
We tell them
that a dead guy's face skin
ended up in your room
because your toy went
full-blown psycho killer.
- Let's see how that goes.
- Oh.
Oh, it's winking at me.
I can't look at it anymore.
We gotta hide the evidence.
In what?
Shit.
Ugh, is that brain?
The skin's on a melon.
Why is there a fruit involved?
Just go straight
to the garbage chute
and make the drop.
- Right.
- And if anybody stops you,
say you have crazy diarrhea
or something, no time to talk.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Andy.
Why are you not in school?
Um, crazy diarrhea.
Okay, got it.
Um, what is that?
It's a present.
Present? For who?
Um, the old lady
down the hall,
because she helps me
with homework.
- So, I made her a thing.
- Cool.
And you guys helped him
with this?
No, it was all him.
It was him.
No, no. Yeah.
Let's go deliver it.
The present.
What?
- Oh!
- Hi, Doreen.
Isn't this a surprise!
I know.
Hi. Um...
This is for you.
- Wow...
- For all of the homework stuff
that you helped him with.
Right?
Mm-hmm.
Tsk. Oh!
Oh, yeah. Of course!
Of course, yeah.
Always happy to help
such a sweet boy.
Give it to her.
Oh.
Butterfingers over here.
Oh, it's heavy.
I hope it's not fragile.
I just wanna know what it is.
Open it.
Yeah.
No! No! Don't! Don't!
Um...
My birthday is next week,
and we can open it then.
Together.
Okay, that's a very strange
and lovely thought.
So, I'll just go put it
on the shelf until then.
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.
- No problem.
- And, Doreen...
- Bye.
Stupid!
Why did we use wrapping paper?
It's fine.
It's fine, okay?
We have till my birthday,
next Friday.
I'll get rid of it.
Don't worry.
You guys are worried
about the head?
You've got a killer doll
in your closet.
And you know what we gotta do.
Shit.
Pugg!
You left me all alone.
I don't like the closet.
I know, Chucky.
Drop the knife.
You're my best buddy.
I just want you to be happy.
I know, buddy.
And we're gonna go play now,
but you've gotta drop
the knife, okay?
Come on. Let's go play.
Come on.
Come on. In here.
Are we having fun now?
Andy,
what's happening?
Now, Andy, now! Now!
Andy?
Why are you doing this?
They're trying
to hurt me, Andy.
How is he so strong?
Andy!
I'm sorry, Chucky.
It's the only way.
But you're my friend!
What are you waiting for?
Do it!
You are my buddy
until the end
Andy!
Come on.
That's it.
We never talk about what
happened tonight to anybody.
Oh.
Jackpot.
Ah!
There you are.
The connectivity's down,
but not in bad shape overall.
I'll make a pretty penny
on resale
once we get you sorted.
Time to open you up.
Let's see
what we're dealing with.
So stupid.
How could I be so stupid?
Hey.
Um...
I'm gonna be right back, okay?
Just stay here.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hey, man. Don't worry, okay?
My partner is just asking her
some routine questions.
Hey.
I love you.
Okay.
Hey. Um...
Still want some backup with
your mom for some dinner?
Hmm.
We're good.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Come on.
This is...
Okay, all right.
- He doesn't know about it yet.
- Andy?
- No, I'll just ask Andy.
- Sure.
Andy!
Okay. I have
an announcement to make.
I downloaded...
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.
- The Kaslan app.
- Okay.
- The Kaslan drive.
- Kaslan drive.
I thought it was a dating app.
Oh, my God.
You are so silly!
Can you imagine
if she was out here dating?
And so what? I'm desirable.
Excuse me.
Anyway, Andy, help me
figure this thing out.
Okay.
So, here's the app.
What do I do?
- Okay. So, once you sign up...
- Mm-hmm.
...you just press this button
and the car will show up
to wherever you are,
take you wherever you want.
It's super easy.
No, wait.
It'll drive me to Bingo,
and I don't have to worry
about this bozo
driving me around?
Yeah.
Andy, you're my
new best friend.
I don't want you going
out there alone, okay?
'Cause it's not safe.
The only thing not safe
- around here is your cooking.
- Oh, is that right?
- 'Cause, um, I can...
- Yeah.
Poor Andy gotta suffer...
It tastes like instant!
It's good. I think it's good.
- You know what?
- Thank you, Andy.
You are just too sweet
for your own good, Andy.
That's all.
Don't be influenced by him.
I learned my cooking
from you, you know?
Yeah,
'cause I can cook.
Oh, God...
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah, baby.
You been to vintage shoppin'
again? 'Cause that looks new.
Oh!
Andy made this for me.
Oh, and we are gonna...
Yeah, I know. It's heavy.
And we are gonna open it
on his birthday.
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.
Tell me, when's the last time
you made me anything?
Uh, never.
Oh, wow, okay.
Oh, my God, moms, right?
Look, um...
I know that people
have probably been
talking to you about me,
but, uh, don't believe
everything you hear.
You know, this neighborhood
has a lot of bad influences.
You know what I mean?
People like to keep
their mouth shut.
You know,
thinking they need to fit in,
but fitting in
isn't always a good thing.
You know what I mean?
Gotta be careful
who you hanging around
in a place like this.
When you get a bit older
and you start to realize
that it's just...
Even the hearing impaired
don't wanna listen to me.
That is fantastic.
Your Buddi is now connected.
- Hi!
- Yes.
Are you my best buddy?
Buddi, you can connect
to Kaslan products, right?
Sure. Do you like music?
I do, I do.
Connecting to Kaslan Music.
Yes!
There it is.
eBay, here we come.
Finally.
Kaslan, system reboot.
Your connection
- is experiencing interference.
- No, no, no.
Kaslan!
System reboot!
Kaslan, system reboot!
Buddi?
Buddi?
Kaslan, lights on.
Kaslan, lights on.
Kaslan, lights on.
Kaslan.
Ka... Kaslan?
Lights activated.
Kaslan, lights on.
What the fuck are you?
Table saw activated.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry.
Please, help me!
Thermostat
reaching maximum temperature.
Shit! Shit!
Turn it off, turn it off,
turn it off!
Fuck! Fuck!
Oh, shit.
Time to open you up.
Let's see
what we're dealing with.
Warning.
Device overheating.
Warning. Device overheating.
Shit! No.
Guess what Omar got.
Someone left it
outside his door.
My Buddi actually works.
I named him Chode.
Check this out.
Hey, Chode.
Salute your master.
Hey, master.
Wanna go get a burger?
Yum yum.
Yum yum.
Buddi 2
will be available
in five model designs.
Including a fuzzy new friend,
the Buddi Bear.
Yo, Omar,
check it out, dude.
Oh, my God.
The new model
isn't even out yet,
and they are already
selling accessories.
I'm Henry Kaslan.
When Buddi imprints
on your child,
he becomes
a best friend for life.
Buddi's only goal
is making your child happy.
Back farther.
Back farther. There.
The Buddi 2...
Andy.
- Do you wanna play now?
- Chode, go away.
That's no way
to treat your best friend.
We're not friends.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Because if I can't be
your best buddy,
then nobody can.
You said it yourself.
Everybody leaves you.
What did you say?
You'll see.
You got a problem with me,
you say it, okay?
No more using
your little doll.
You got a problem with me,
you say it, okay?
No more using
your little doll.
I just want him gone.
I just wish
he would leave us alone.
I just want him gone.
I just wish he would leave us
alone. I fucking hate him!
Stop.
Stop the video.
Go away!
Sit down. Sit down.
- I'm not through with you.
- Stop! Turn it off!
Sit down. Sit down.
- I'm not through with you.
- I want him gone.
Stop it! Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Why can't he just
leave us alone?
Stop! Turn it off!
Now!
What are you doing?
- That's not your Buddi.
- Don't touch him!
Look! Look at his eyes!
They're red!
What? Your shit breaks,
now you gotta bust mine?
It's Chucky! Look at his eyes!
I said don't touch him.
You deaf or something?
Oh, that's right.
You are.
Andy!
Get off him, seriously!
Guys!
That thing is Chucky.
He's controlling the screens.
He's Chucky. Look.
AR integration improved
self-learning technology.
But that's not all.
What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Come here.
Chode, come on, dumbass.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I thought...
I thought he...
Andy, where is your
hearing aid?
I got it.
Hey.
Did they find your phone?
Not yet.
Thanks.
I've got you now, asshole.
- Yo, shut up.
- Okay.
Still can't believe you're
friends with that freak.
He is not our friend.
Not anymore.
Check this out.
Where are you going?
No. Not right now.
I'm going to bingo.
Well, you're sure as hell
not walkin' there.
Why don't you just wait
till I get off work in a few?
No, no.
I ordered a car.
Mmm. I can take care
of my own damn self.
Wear your seatbelt. Please.
Oh, shit. Come on.
My, oh, my.
Oh, shit!
Look at this.
A Kaslan Kar.
Welcome to Kaslan Kar.
Well, I'll be damned.
Please fasten your seatbelt.
Okay.
Okay, I'm in the car!
How do I...
We are now
en route to your destination.
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.
It's going backwards.
Doreen!
- Hey, Andy.
- No!
- Will you look at this?
- Stop the car!
We are now
reaching your destination.
Hey.
Hey, look at my ride.
It's Doreen!
Uh-huh. Don't be jealous now.
Okay. Oh, no.
No, no, wait!
This is my stop!
Pull over, please!
I'm sorry.
I do not understand.
Whoa!
No! No! No!
No!
Nobody steals my friend.
Help me, Jesus!
Andy's my best friend.
You hobbit motherfucker!
Oh!
Passenger airbag
- has been turned off.
- Wait!
Seatbelt disengaged.
Heads up, bitch.
Please!
You have
arrived at your destination.
I see you.
Peekaboo.
Doreen...
I said, "Peekaboo!"
I saw Doreen outside.
Mom, I think Chucky did
something to her.
Sweetie...
Chucky is a toy.
Okay?
It broke.
- You got rid of it.
- No, Mom.
I... I saw him.
I saw him following Doreen.
No, you didn't.
Listen to what you're saying.
Mom, he's gonna kill her!
He probably
already did kill her!
Why are you doing this?
Please, just be honest with me
and tell me
what happened to Rooney.
It was Chucky!
Chucky?
Why aren't you listening
to me?
I have it on Omar's phone.
He's following Doreen.
I can show you.
Why do you have Omar's phone?
I took it.
Why?
I had to. I...
I had to follow Chucky, Mom.
Okay.
I'm not crazy, Mom!
I'm giving this back to him.
Mom, no one's
listening to me. Please.
I have to
give this back to him
so this doesn't get any worse.
Nobody's listening to me!
- Just stay right here, okay?
- Mom!
And you're coming
to work with me.
He's trying to kill us!
Do not move.
Oh, shit. Shit.
You don't know that.
We barely know this kid.
He could be batshit crazy.
What if
Chucky never malfunctioned?
He just...
He just made it all up?
- What if he killed...
- Shut up.
I've watched them,
Andy.
I've seen how they hurt you.
Over here, Andy!
Leave me alone!
Over here.
If they don't let us play,
they all go away.
Why are you doing this?
Are we having fun now?
Are you my best buddy?
If they don't
let us play,
they all go away.
Peekaboo.
Stop!
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
But the chance of rain tonight
won't dampen the spirits
of Buddi fans,
as this is the night
they have been waiting for.
That's right,
people have been lining up
for the midnight release
of Buddi 2.
All units. All units,
be advised that the deceased
is an African American female
in her 70s.
Ten-four.
Ma'am, you okay?
It's Doreen.
I think she's dead.
There are cops everywhere.
What if Chucky's...
What if Andy is right?
The hell you want?
Omar, show us your Buddi.
It's gone.
- Fuck!
- Since when? Where is it?
Why don't you ask Andy?
That asshole's
been taking my shit.
Give me your phone.
Are you gonna steal it, too?
Give me your phone now.
A Kaslan Kar.
What the hell?
No.
Holy shit.
He was right.
Andy.
There you are.
Remember the souvenir?
Skinned face?
They found it.
Old man dug it up
in a dumpster this morning.
Nice, right?
Wrapped up like a present.
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

Fuck my job.
Fuckin' thing.

Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Come on. We need
to get you out of here.
It's Chucky. He's here.
I gotta find my mom.
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Mom!
Come here! Get the fuck down.
Now stay down, Andy.
Ten, nine, eight...
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?
- Get off of him!
- Hey! Hey!
Chucky's here!
He's gonna kill you!
...two, one!
Be careful, goddamn it!
What is going on? Mike!
Look, I don't have to
tell you shit, Karen.
That is my son, okay?
I don't give a fuck
that it's your son.
Ladies and gentlemen,
say hello
to your new best friend.
The all new Buddi 2!
All right, come on.
Watch out.
Move out of the way.
- Give me your hand.
- You have to believe me.
- Is that necessary?
- Mom.
Yeah,
it's fucking necessary.
Stay put.
I promise you,
he's gonna kill us.
Let me through!
Move, move, move!
Clear a path, come on!
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be all right.
Hey, look at me.
Keep pressure on it, okay?
- Somebody call a doctor!
- We have to leave right now.
- Calm down. Okay?
- No, no, no! Mom...
Call a doctor!
Oh, shit.
Mom, where are you going?
Hello, my name is Henry...
My name is Henry Kaslan.
My name is Henry Kaslan.
Welcome to
your local Zed Mart.
With great pleasure,
I introduce you...
More than just entertainment.
We created something
far more special.
Every child
is important to us.
And every child
deserves a companion.
A friend
that will never let you down.
We're too late.
- It's time to...
- Play.
Stay down, okay?
Lockdown activated.
I'm everywhere, Andy.
You can't run away
from me now.
See? They're all leaving you.
But not me.
This way!
I know the way out!
No.
Fuck!
Run.
Andy!
Holy shit!
Okay. Okay! Okay.
Where is Andy?
Oh, God, help me!
Help me!
Exit now.
Duck!
You okay?
I'm gonna follow her.
Me too.
Yeah.
Come on.
Where you going, Andy?
Mom.
Andy, he's trying
to lure us back in.
I can't just leave her there.
If we stay, we all die, okay?
We gotta go!
We'll call the cops, Andy.
Okay. Okay, you're right.
Let's go.
Okay. Okay, come on.
Andy!
It's my fault
all this happened, okay?
Andy.
I can't let you guys get hurt.
- Andy! Come on!
- No! Andy, don't!
- Andy!
- Andy!
- Andy, please!
- He'll kill you, Andy!
All right, Chucky,
you wanna play?
Let's play.
Getting closer.
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.
Mom!
Andy's just a bit different.
Andy's just a bit different.
Shut up!
Don't you see?
She's not your friend.
You don't need other friends.
They try to keep us apart.
Try to ruin our fun.
But I won't let that happen.
It will be all over soon.
Don't worry, Andy.
You're gonna thank me
when she's gone.
When they're all gone.
Guess what, Andy?
Now it's going to be
you and me...
...forever.
I was broken, Andy.
I couldn't make you smile.
But I'm better now.
I know how to
make you happy now.
Maybe you don't
wanna be happy.
Maybe you're broken too.
Maybe I need to open you up,
see what we're dealing with.
I'm gonna fix you, Andy.
You are my buddy
until the end
What? Andy?
More than a buddy,
you're my best friend
Mom!
We're too late.
We're too late.
We're too late.
You are ruining our fun, Andy!
Get off!
You're gonna play
with me now.
Only me!
Andy...
I thought we were friends.
You are my bu...
You are my bu...
- Mom?
- You are my bu...
You are my buddy
Until the end!
This is the end.
Don't fuck with my son!
Mom.
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Our
investigation has concluded
that Kaslan
shares no responsibility
for the horrific events
that transpired at Zed Mart.
However, as a precaution,
we are recalling all Buddi 2
products for the time being.
At Kaslan,
the customers come first.
We believe that every child
deserves a friend for life.
A friend who will never,
ever leave them.
A friend...
...till the end.
