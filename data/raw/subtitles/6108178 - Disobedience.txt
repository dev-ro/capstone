In the beginning,
Hashem made
three types of creatures,
the angels,
the beasts,
and the human beings.
The angels, He made
from His pure word.
The angels have
no will to do evil.
They cannot deviate for one
moment from His purpose.
The beasts have only their
instincts to guide them.
They, too,
follow the commands of their maker.
The Torah states
that Hashem spent almost
six whole days of creation
fashioning these creatures.
Then, just before sunset,
He took a small
quantity of earth
and from it He fashioned
man and woman.
An afterthought?
Or His crowning achievement?
So, what is this thing?
Man?
Woman?
It is a being with
the power to disobey.
Alone among
all the creatures
we have free will.
We hang suspended
between the clarity
of the angels
and the desires
of the beasts.
Hashem gave us choice,
which is both a privilege and a burden.
We must then choose
the tangled life
we live.
Call an ambulance.
Rav.
Rav.
Open your eyes.
Take a breath.
And so you were 15 when you first...
First got a tattoo?
That one really hurt.
That one hurt,
and it was Jesus there.
- Jesus really hurt.
- Mmm-hmm.
It's lovely.
Are you getting
what you need?
This is fantastic, yeah.
Thank you. Are you all right?
I'll need a smoke
in a bit.
Mmm-hmm.
Five more minutes?
I got it.
Mmm-hmm.
Chin down a little bit.
That's lovely when
you smile a little bit.
- Ronnie.
- Not now.
Ronnie.
You need to speak
to this man.
Hello there.
- Yes.
- Is Dovid here?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Rabbi, there's
someone here to see you.
- Who is it?
- She didn't say.
Thanks, Naomi.
Dovid.
Ronit.
Ronit.
We weren't expecting you.
No?
- I thought...
- May you live a long life.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Did you come straight
from the airport?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll go to a hotel.
There's people here
to honor the Rav.
Right.
You okay?
Yeah.
How did he die?
Pneumonia, finally.
I'll just find a place
to put these.
- Take this.
- I'll be back.
- Right.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
Hello.
Hello.
Ronit.
- Fruma?
- It's really you!
Moshe.
Ronit, you're here.
Of course you're here.
Oh.
Hello.
Fruma.
Ronit.
Uncle Hartog.
How are you?
I'm all right.
May you live a long life.
Yeah. Take your coat off.
Come on, and the scarf...
- No, I'm keeping this.
- And the gloves.
Fruma.
So,
you came.
Are you all right?
Have you
got any coffee?
- Can I have some?
- Come.
Do you still take it black?
- Yeah, thanks.
I'll get a cab in a bit.
Stay here, Ronit.
Oh, no, that's all right.
Thank you.
Stay here.
Really?
Thanks.
Hmm.
So you came to...
To mourn the Rav.
Why else would I be here?
You were never
very predictable.
Are you still
angry with me?
You left very suddenly.
You married?
Mmm.
When did that happen?
A while ago.
Say more. Who is she?
Do I know her?
Oh, God, it's
not Hinda, is it?
Dovid, you didn't marry
Hinda of Hendon, did you?
Oh, you did. You did, you married Hinda.
Oh, shit, Dovid, no.
No.
- No, I didn't marry Hinda.
- Well, that's good.
Although that does leave about 20
women out there identical to Hinda.
- Why are they all exactly the same?
- Don't be cruel.
Hello, Esti.
Ronit. How are you?
I'm, um,
- here, which is strange.
- Mmm-hmm.
How are you?
Uh, may you live
a long life.
Thank you.
You look very, uh,
- New York.
- Well...
Goodness, you look
very frum, Esti.
Shall I take
more food out?
Don't, leave it, let's talk.
Why doesn't
- Dovid's wife do it?
- When she appears.
So who is
Mrs. Kuperman, Esti?
Do we approve?
Ronit was going
to go to a hotel,
but I told her she
should stay with us.
Ah, yes, yes. You must.
Yeah, I'll fold down the bed
in the spare room.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
It's fine.
You're married.
Yes.
Yes we are, Ronit.
Nobody told me.
Why didn't you
let me know?
You disappeared.
Wow.
Okay.
Congratulations.
No, no,
please. Please.
- Come.
- Okay.
The Hesped is going
to be a big event.
You and Esti
got married?
It was always
the three of us.
Yeah, you went away.
Left the two of us.
Well, I would have come over,
if you'd told me he was ill.
The Rav didn't
want you to know.
He became very frail at the end.
He probably
didn't want you
to see him like that.
You still should
have called me.
This week has been
harsh, Ronit.
Hmm? Please?
My father just died.
I know.
I know, I was there.
Well,
at least you let me know
he was dead.
It's important that this week
is conducted with honor.
Honor?
It's the most
important thing.
Of course it is.
Sorry, it's
a bit of a mess.
- I'll get you some hangers.
- - Thanks.
What?
I look older?
- I wasn't thinking that.
- Mmm.
I look tired.
We all do.
Esti, do you think
I should stay somewhere else?
Do what you want.
Do the windows open?
No.
Uh, if you want to smoke
you need to go downstairs.
Here.
I brought you
an extra blanket.
"Rav Krushka's
untimely death
"is a crushing blow
to Anglo-Jewry.
"He was a giant of the faith.
"Sadly, he left
no children."
Lazy journalism.
- That would have upset the Rav.
- Childless.
It was probably written
by some 12-year-old reporter.
Forget about it.
Everybody loves him
so much.
I used to wonder if I loved him as
much as all those strangers did.
Sometimes I used to wonder
if I loved him at all.
- You're his daughter.
- Mmm-hmm.
But he was closer to you.
He enjoyed teaching me.
So,
get some sleep, Ronit.
Good night.
Oh, I brought you, um...
I brought this for...
Well, for you.
It's...
- Oh, it's your pictures.
- Yeah.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Pleasure.
Good night.
So is it good being
married to each other?
Yes.
We're very happy.
Good night.
You all right?
That's my dad.
Come on, let's go.
Sorry for your loss.
You okay?
Yes.
Good morning,
Mrs. Kuperman!
Morning, Rina.
How are you?
- Good, thank you.
- Good.
- How was your week?
- Good.
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Hannah.
At first, as she's never had
a class of her own, but no.
Good.
I've really appreciated
the time off.
Of course.
It's good to have
you back, Esti.
Oh, thank you.
Good morning, girls.
Good morning,
Mrs. Kuperman.
Well, I missed you.
- Yosef.
- Rabbi!
Morning.
- Dr. Rigler.
- Good morning.
How is your speech
coming along?
I'm working on it.
- It will be a wonderful Hesped.
- I hope so.
The Rav would be
very proud of you, Dovid.
Appreciate that.
Ronit Krushka
is staying with you, hmm?
Yes, she is.
Good day.
"A bundle of myrrh
is my beloved to me,
"that lies all night
between my breasts.
"My beloved is to me
as a cluster of henna blooms
"in the vineyards
of Ein-Gedi."
Is it about sensuality?
That is, the way in which
true love manifests itself?
But might it also be
that between a male
and a female
that there's something
higher than that.
But isn't it that the
references to sensual pleasures
celebrate physical
love here?
The enjoyment of that love becomes,
in this context, the highest.
"See, you are fair,
my love,
"you are fair,
"your eyes are doves.
"See, you are handsome,
my beloved, yea, pleasing,
"and our bed is verdant."
Could I have a piece
of apple strudel?
And, um, also,
could I get one of these?
The Linzer biscuit, yeah.
- Linzer biscuit?
- Yeah.
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.
Do you have shoes?
Yeah, okay.
Candles...
What? Is it wrong?
It's only Uncle Hartog.
No, and Rabbi
and Rebbetzin Goldfarb.
He still invited me?
No, I have invited you.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay.
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.
Good Shabbos.
Good Shabbos.
- Amen
- OTHERS: Amen.
We understood it
the first time,
you don't have
to explain it.
She always
overexplains a joke.
That's the trouble.
- He never lets it go.
- Hard to get by with such a Jewish name.
Every day he mentions his name.
It's unbelievable.
What kind of
a name is "Andy"?
He's got nothing else to say
about him except his name.
What? No, I have something else to say.
He's a nebbish.
- Yeah, that's the other thing.
- I'm sorry, I love my son.
This is his
own father talking.
- Yeah, what do you think?
- I love him.
So our youngest, Basha,
just had her second boy.
And they named him Daniel, for my father.
Ah, mazel tov.
They live in Australia.
It's too far.
Melbourne.
Thirty-seven grandchildren!
- Mazel tov.
- Not bad.
We saw your photos
in a magazine.
It was the pictures of the
twins that you showed us.
But they
called you Ronnie Curtis?
That's my
professional name.
What was wrong with
your real name, Krushka?
You should be proud of it.
Artists change
their names sometimes,
- don't they, Moshe?
- That's right, Fruma.
Women change
their names every day.
They take their
husband's names
and their own
history is gone.
Don't they?
I wouldn't talk
about "gone."
Not gone.
Yes, they do.
Ronit,
you look so like
your mother.
Oh, don't start!
Hasn't she got Leah's eyes,
don't you think, Moshe?
Yeah, she's got
beautiful eyes.
- Oh, she's a beauty.
- Uncle...
Your dear sister
was taken far too soon.
And now the Rav.
This must be a terrible
shock for you, Ronit.
You're away, it's a shock.
Of course it is.
We never thought
we'd see you again.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Ronit...
- More coffee?
- Oh, no. No thanks.
I'd love to talk to you about the house,
though, at some point, Uncle.
Yeah, sorry.
Come to the office.
- We'll talk about it there.
- All right.
You know, you must take your
mother's candlesticks, Ronit.
From the house.
Yes, of course, and then
- you must give them to your children.
- Oh, I don't want children.
I'm not having children.
You keep them and then
you pass them on.
Yes. Yes. I want
to sell the house, Uncle.
Do you think you can help me to sell it?
No, please.
- Not now.
- I'm gonna need some help, though.
- Yes, but not... Ronit...
- Sorry.
How old were you, Dovid,
when the Rav took
you in and taught you?
Thirteen, was it?
Mmm... Yeah.
Twelve, thirteen.
Dovid has been
doing great work.
Wonderful work.
Wonderful work.
A lot has changed
since you were here.
There's a lot of problems.
Housing, and jobs...
The youth.
Even an incident with drugs.
Perhaps people should stop
having so many children.
It's nothing we
cannot deal with.
And you're not married.
You must find
someone, Ronit.
- It's not funny growing old alone.
- Oh, well I'm rarely alone.
I've got wonderful friends.
I expect you have lots of fun.
But that will pass.
But being married, well,
that's the way
it should be.
Oh, is it?
The way it should be?
Or is it just
institutional obligation?
Now, Ronit,
stop right there.
I mean, Uncle,
let's just say
I stayed here
for one more year.
Let's think about this,
okay, right?
I would be
married off to whoever
and then, after ten years
in some loveless marriage
I might have ended up
killing myself.
Or I would've felt
like killing myself.
I am really jetlagged,
so I think I should...
I'm gonna hit the road.
And, I'll see you both
back at the house.
It was great to see you,
Rabbi, Rebbetzin, Fruma.
Happy Shabbos, darling.
Uncle,
thank you for dinner.
- I'll see you guys...
- Why don't you walk her home,
- and I'll catch up.
- Okay.
Sorry.
Thank you,
it was delicious.
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.
Ronit.
Hmm.
Why is Rebbetzin
Goldfarb so mean?
She has a good life.
What does she want?
Mmm.
What does anybody want?
What do you really want?
Do you know what you really want?
Yes, I do. I do know.
I want my dad to know
that I loved him.
Do you think
he knew that?
Yes, yes, he did.
He had to know.
I'm so sorry,
so sorry, Ronit.
The Rav...
You've lost your father.
It goes well, actually.
It's lovely, yeah.
I don't normally wear such a bright color.
It's really good.
It goes with the tempo.
It looks beautiful.
- So if you want to just...
- You can just...
- He's ready for you now.
- Thanks.
Um, the wig...
- Uh, Ronit, hello.
- Hello.
- Let's go upstairs, shall we?
- Okay.
Come in.
Have a seat, please.
Ronit...
I've gone frum!
Please don't joke. Hmm?
So...
These are the keys for you to
gather any personal possessions.
A lot of keys.
Hmm.
Would you help me sell it?
Clause three.
"Last will and testament
of Rav Shlomo Krushka."
Rav Krushka, bless his memory,
left the house
and everything in it
to the synagogue.
- I'm sorry if that's a shock.
- No.
It's just a house.
A father should have a child to
look after him in his final hours.
I didn't know
that he was ill.
How could you know
when you're not here?
You were all he had left.
I know.
It must be very
painful for you
not to receive
the Rav's forgiveness.
Hello, Mrs. Kuperman!
- Hello, Shmuli!
- Hello.
- Rivkah, hi.
- Hello, Esti.
- You look great.
- Oh, thank you!
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're good. We're good!
- Good, good.
- And, and,
all the help, Esti,
it was very appreciated.
Of course.
Hi, Shayna. Hi!
Oh, so sweet.
I saw Ronit just now.
Oh...
- Where?
- She was just walking down the street.
She hasn't changed,
has she?
No...
She hasn't.
Oh, okay.
- See you later.
- Bye, bye.
- Bye.
- Bye, Mrs. Kuperman.
There, there.
There, there.
Ronit?
Uh... You're
wearing a wig.
No.
Here. Here, let me.
There you go.
Thank you.
I'm sorry
it's such a mess. I...
Your uncle said he was taking
care of everything, and...
He didn't want us
to touch anything
before they
take it away.
Hmm.
He left it all
to the synagogue.
Mmm-hmm.
Would you really want it?
Financial freedom? No.
That would be
far too easy.
Would've been nice, though,
if he'd just mentioned me in his will.
Left me a pipe.
I know.
I'm not gonna go
to the Hesped.
- What?
- There's no point in my being here.
I'm gonna change
my ticket.
But...
Mmm.
You know, what really gets me
is I never took his portrait.
So, all he did all day,
was stay in here
and read the Torah
and the commentaries on the Torah
and the notes on the commentaries
- and the debates on the notes.
- Mmm.
And it meant we could
do what we wanted.
Esti, do you think
I should go back early?
No.
No.
No, I don't think
you should leave at all.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Oh...
Ronit...
Esti...
When I saw you...
Me too.
Esti, Esti, Esti...
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
No, it's...
It's okay.
I'm really sorry.
It's fine.
I...
You do look
like your mother.
Oh...
Ronit, are you okay?
It was me
who rang the shul
in New York
to let you know.
I'm just gonna
get some air.
Why did you get married, Esti?
Why didn't you just leave?
Do you remember what the Rav
used to say about marriage?
- No.
- You do.
"Will you grow
old alone?"
No, no. "Will you grow old
with no family, no joys?"
"Dovid is
a good boy. He...
"He has a generous heart,
and he's crazy about you. Marry him."
So everything was
all right when I left?
No.
I was ill.
What sort of ill?
In my head.
The Rav was afraid for me,
and if I had to sleep
with a man,
why not with
our best friend?
Oh, Esti...
I think, I think he felt that
marriage would cure me.
It hasn't been
a complete disaster.
And that's enough?
Do you have to have
sex every Friday?
- It's expected.
- It's medieval.
It's not mandatory.
Nobody gets beaten
if they don't feel like it.
What happened to you?
Nothing.
You happened to me.
And then I started teaching
and that became important.
You can teach anywhere.
I really love the girls.
And I give them ambition.
To do what? Push out seven
babies and be a good wife?
Don't. Don't.
I'm a good teacher.
- And I help them to value themselves.
- Okay, but what about you?
That is me.
Huh.
What?
Do you want a cigarette?
No.
And you? Are you happy?
Yes, I am.
Have you been
with other women?
No.
Not really.
Mmm.
And you?
No.
But, Esti...
Do you still
only fancy women?
Mmm-hmm.
Your bag is, um...
What?
It's extremely erotic.
- Can I take it for a spin?
- Mmm-mmm. No.
You're not frum.
You don't get one.
Oh, please.
- No.
- A quick spin. Come on.
- Please.
- Fine. Have a turn.
One sexy bag, baby.
What about children?
I have three in the bag.
All redheads.
I think it suits me.
This is where
you first kissed me.
It's insane
that you're here.
Oh, fuck!
Ronit?
Is that you?
- Yes.
- What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm just having a wander
around the old places.
This is my husband, Lev.
This is Ronit,
the Rav's daughter.
Remember? I told you
all about her.
How's it going, Lev? Hi.
I hear that you're
attending the Hesped.
The Rav was
a truly great man.
Oh, yes, I know,
I'm his daughter.
Would you like
a cigarette?
Was that
Rebbetzin Kuperman?
No.
Esti!
Are you all right?
Uh, yes. I'm fine.
Esti...
I'll be out in a minute.
What's happened?
What?
What's happened?
"'Tis true.
There's magic in the web of it.
"A sibyl, that had number'd
in the world
"The sun to course
200 compasses,
"In her prophetic fury
sew'd the work.
"The worms were hallow'd
that did breed the silk,
"And it was dy'd in mummy
which the skilful
"Conserv'd of
maidens' hearts."
Very good, Sara.
So what stands out for you
in the play so far?
The handkerchief.
With the strawberries on it.
Mmm-hmm.
And why is
that significant?
Anyone?
Do you remember what Othello
says about how it was made?
Yes, Rina.
He says that the red of it
was dye from virgins' blood.
That's right.
That's right. Yes?
And the lies.
Iago just lies more and more.
And you don't know why.
Mmm. And the killing,
Mrs. Kuperman.
- That was horrible.
- It was.
Her death is very shocking.
But...
- I'm sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Kuperman.
- It's all right.
Mrs. Shapiro needs
to see you.
Uh, thank you.
I'll go in the break.
Immediately, she said.
Keep reading the scenes
in pairs, girls.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Good morning, girls.
Good morning,
Miss Scheinberg.
Carry on reading
where you left off.
Come in, Esti.
Mrs. Shapiro...
Have a seat.
We would all be very happy if you
chose to take on the Rav's work.
There are always obstacles, of course,
to anything that is challenging.
It would be difficult to
measure up to the Rav
in any meaningful way.
And your wife.
She would welcome it
if you took over the shul?
Yes. Esti will support me with
whatever decision I make.
And Ronit Krushka?
We were surprised
at her presence.
Ronit is grieving.
And we will make her
very welcome at the Hesped.
Of course.
And Esti? She won't be
distracted by Ronit's return?
Why should she be?
This is my house
we're talking about.
I keep it in order.
Good.
Hello.
Esti? What's happened?
- Are you all right?
- Not here.
Yesterday,
I behaved like an adolescent.
So stupid
and so senseless.
Did someone
say something?
Yes! Yes!
And I live here.
Tell me,
what did they say?
The headmistress, she...
It doesn't matter.
I...
We need to stop this.
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.
I can't do this. I can't.
Okay.
We try here.
We try to lead a good life.
I know. I know.
And I do believe profoundly.
The word of Hashem
is my life.
I am...
I'm going to
leave tomorrow.
I don't want you to go.
I don't want that.
Esti, I didn't know anything like this was
going to happen. I really didn't. I...
I didn't even know that I was
going to see you for sure.
Can we just go somewhere else?
Can we just get out of here?
Please, come on.
Come on.
We need to just
go somewhere else.
Come here.
I used to think about
your life in New York.
Mmm.
I tried to imagine
your room.
I kept track of
the time difference.
So I knew when you were awake
and when you were asleep.
What?
I was just thinking of
the Rav walking in on us.
Oh, don't.
His face.
What did he say?
"Hashem,
strike me dead!"
Oh, no!
It was awful.
I want to take your picture.
For the Jewish Messenger?
No. No.
Look at me.
Esti, look at me.
Esti?
Sorry I'm so late.
Did you eat something?
Don't...
Mrs. Shapiro made a formal
complaint about you and Ronit.
What?
She came to you?
Yes.
Tell me the truth.
I, uh... I kissed Ronit.
You kissed her?
I'm sorry.
Esti!
- What are you doing to us?
- I've tried!
- I have!
- What do you want?
- I've tried!
- What do you want?
You want to be hurt again?
Has Ronit asked you
to go back with her?
Oh, Dovid!
She'll go back to her friends.
Her men.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
I mean, what is it?
Just tell me.
You can tell me.
- Can I? Can I?
- Yes.
- We've always been honest with each other.
- Have we?
- We have. Yes.
- Have we?
I got the message to Ronit
about her father.
- I wanted her to come back.
- No.
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.
- She's taking advantage of you.
- Look at me.
- You can't even see it, you're blind.
- No, no one's taking advantage.
- You're blind!
- No!
Look at me!
I wanted it to happen.
And when we were girls...
Even then, it was the same.
It's always been this way!
I have always wanted it.
I think you should leave him.
Really?
And where would I go?
I'm late for school.
Rabbi...
Fruma.
Elliot.
The Rav would be so happy
to know that you came.
I'm so glad we could come.
Joey, thank you for coming
from so far.
- Rabbi, I wish you long life.
- Thank you.
- Rabbi.
- Thank you for being here.
- The Rav will be immensely missed.
- Thank you.
- We're very sorry.
- Thank you for coming.
Very sorry.
Are you not eating?
It's good.
- Very good.
- Hmm.
I booked a flight.
I'll be leaving tonight.
What?
Oh.
That's good.
That's good.
I hope the Hesped goes well.
Now it will.
What about you?
What?
What will you be doing?
Uh, I don't know.
Try. Try to explain it to me.
I can't.
Oh, I should pack.
Goodbye.
It's easier to leave,
isn't it?
No, it isn't.
Are you free?
Excuse me.
Hello?
Dovid?
No.
No, she's not with me.
When did you last see her?
Well, she'll be back, Dovid,
don't worry.
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, Dovid, can I call you
back when I've gone through security?
Hello. Hello,
where are you flying to today?
New York.
Esti!
Esti.
Esti!
Hmm.
Esti?
I wish she'd never
contacted you.
Well, I'm glad that she did
the right thing.
My father died.
- You weren't even going to let me know.
- Can you see why I didn't?
I was protecting my wife.
Dovid...
I want you to give me
my freedom.
Esti, come here.
I was terrified.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
for you to worry.
I'm pregnant.
A child.
Hashem is looking over us.
I don't think we should be
together anymore.
- It's His wish.
- No.
I was born
into this community.
I had no choice.
I want my child to be free
to decide.
We've waited so long
for this.
Please give me my freedom.
No, no, no...
- Dovid, you can't...
- Stay out of it.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
You came back.
- Fruma.
- Esti.
I don't want to upset anyone.
I just need to honor my father.
I know.
Please.
Amen.
Why don't you come
to New York?
Why don't you just come
to New York and be with me?
Rav Krushka's departure
leaves us
facing a void,
bewildered.
Today,
we take comfort in knowing
that his legacy
will be preserved
and carried through
to the next generation.
I call upon a new voice,
Rav Krushka's
closest disciple,
spiritual son
and successor,
Rabbi Dovid Kuperman.
Rabbi Kuperman.
Rav Krushka often spoke about
the duty of the teacher.
The duty...
I'm sorry, I can't...
The Rav's only child, Ronit Krushka,
is here with us today.
The Rav's final words
to us...
Why did he choose to discuss
the idea of choice?
And freedom.
There's nothing so tender
or truthful
as the true feeling
of being free.
Hmm? Free to choose.
The Rav was a giant of Torah.
But it wasn't a giant
we saw collapse that day.
It was a man.
He talked of the angels
and of the desires of
the beasts.
And with his final words,
he reminded us of this.
We are free to choose!
You are free.
You are free!
I cannot accept the honor or
position that is offered
to me.
I do not have
sufficient understanding.
Please forgive me.
I'm just, uh, slipping out.
Shalom.
Goodbye, Dovid.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Is that you, then?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
May you live a long life.
May you live a long life.
- Which terminal?
- Five, please.
Ronit! Wait!
Stop! Could you stop, please?
Stop the car.
You will be
a brilliant mother.
You're going to be brave
and beautiful.
I love you.
I love you.
Will you tell me
where you are?
Yes. I will.
Excuse me?
Do you mind
if we make a small detour?
Goodbye, Dad.
