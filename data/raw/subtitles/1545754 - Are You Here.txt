I wake up happy.
I mean, I'm that guy.
I've got enough
of everything I need.
I'm single, I like a party,

young enough to enjoy it.
I wanna do something, I do it.

- Oh.
Must be the magnetic stripe.
And the weird thing is,
I know it's all a cliche.
No strings, no obligations,
but what's the alternative?
Get into some life:
Wife, kids,
some kind of car
with too many seats.
That's a world where
you have to do whatever it is
other people want you to do
to keep it going.
It's prostitution,
when you think about it.
But there
is this nagging feeling
that I'm missing something.
- Sorry, I don't know
what the problem is.
- No, it's not your fault.
That should do it.
And maybe, in the end,
I'm worrying for nothing.
I mean, I'm not

Whoa, come on, wait.
You know I have money.
I just don't have any on me

But I get paid all the time,

- Maybe next time.
Car fare?
And, by the way,
as someone who's life
really is prostitution,
I can tell you that until you're

you shouldn't be complaining.

- I guess that's what
I've really been
trying to write about.
I mean, who are we trying
to fool?
We're not only animals, we're
the worst animals there are.
Why do we eat meat?
The greek gods dined
on ambrosia and nectar.
But we need to incorporate
other species into us.
Look at christianity:
"This is my body,
this is my blood."
that's why I'm doing
this chapter
about the genocide in rwanda.
The tutsis were vegetarians,
and the hutus were ranchers
who eat meat,
and they regarded the tutsis
as monkeys, as animals,
and that's why they had
no trouble killing 'em,
don't you think?
- Honestly, ben,
I don't know why
the farmer and the cowhand
can't be friends.
But I do know
that part of the reason
why some people regard
other people as animals
is because they don't observe
the social conventions
most of us take for granted.
- Every human function
is disgusting in our society.
- I side with the public
on this one.

- And broke.
- That is so uncool.
- Can't I just take
some money back?
I get paid very soon,
and when I do,
I'm gonna float you
another loan.
Until then, I'd like
to borrow back what I leant you.
- Why do you need to leave?
You're just gonna go out there
and be part of the machine.
- Hey, that machine
is what keeps you
in all... this.
Now, you know there's no one
out there today, right?
- Yeah.
- So just hold it together

but I was thinking about
taking the money
from the grocery store
and creating an institute
where people can come and study
how to regain man's balance
with nature.
Horticulture, agriculture,
aquaculture.
Angela, you know
about all this shit,
and you can give lessons
on cleaning
and all that women's stuff.
And, steve,
if we're gonna have a society,
we're gonna need
a tv station.
You could have
the whole station.
- That sounds great.
You look like
you haven't slept much.
Why don't you sit down,
and we'll have some breakfast
and talk about the plan.
- You understand
I'm talking
about fundamental changes
to society.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not hungry.
I have a mission statement
to write.
- Is it always like that?
- He usually doesn't make
that much sense.
I'll be right back.
Hey, genius at work.
- I'm modeling it
on plato's school of athens,
only not the socratic method.
It's more like buddha.
You can relax.
I can see what's going on
in your face right now.
- It's 1/10th
of what's going on in my mind.
- You told me that my father
had a plan for me
to do what I wanted,
and this is what I want,
and I'm not leaving you
behind!
The tv station thing
was just off the top of my head.
I want you to know
that I'm grateful.
And the way that I figure it,
there's enough for me
to keep the grocery store
and for you to have
the farm and the house.
And it's not a gift.
You've earned it.
- Suddenly, the plan
seems more appealing,
but I don't think you're...
you seem a little...
- the journey to enlightenment
is stressful.
- No, it's not enlightened.
[CAR APPROACHING]
Great, mom's home.
- Why are you still here?
- Why are you so angry?
- This was my mother's.
- I need you to mellow out.
- I need to keep
my wits about me.
I wanna get this all down.
- Please, you're out of control.
Let's take the edge off.
[LIGHTS LIGHTER]
- Great.
This is my wedding
all over again.
- What are you doing?
This is important shit!
This is a chance
to right your life!
Drugs are not the answer!
- That's what I've been saying!
- Thank god you're here,
because I can't do it all alone.
- Jesus, get out and go away.
I need to talk to my brother.
- He doesn't wanna talk.
- Yes, I do, I have a plan.
I'm gonna start...
- ben, you don't have
to tell her your plan.
- Steve, I would prefer
to forego your input,
since it most recently resulted
in my brother becoming fat,
unemployed, and growing
that superbly antisocial beard.
- Do not talk to him like that.
- No, no, it's okay.
You know what, terry?
I am gonna get out of your way.
So you can direct that rage
where it really belongs...
at your grieving family.
- He doesn't understand
what's going on.
The decisions that you make now
could secure a real future.
- You don't think I know that?
- I'm sorry!
I guess I just
got blindsided yesterday.
- It blew me away too!
I didn't want the headache,
but then I thought,
"all of this is part
of something amazing.
Life stuff, renewal,
rebuilding."
- yes, exactly.
- I mean, this chrysalis
has served us
as we developed
from pupa to adult.
And now, it has to be
shed and eaten.
- What are we talking about?
- I really want to utilize
this capital
to right some major wrongs,
educate some mysteries,
set some ideas free.
- Well, why don't I find a way
to manage my finances
so I can support you
in eight months,
after you've pissed away what
it took dad a lifetime to make.
- I hear where you're coming
from, but it's just money.
It doesn't mean dad
loved me more than you.
- What?
- It doesn't mean dad loved me
more than you.
- He didn't...
love you more.
You were the squeaky wheel,
so you got all the oil.
And if I were you,
I wouldn't rush off to go change
the world quite yet.
- Hello!
Anybody?
I'm gonna go now.
Ben! Ben!
- Yeah, I'm up here.
- Look at you.
Master of all you survey.
- Yeah.
- You know, I wouldn't go if
I didn't have this job thing.
I'll be out next weekend,
I promise.
Plus, you can always call.
- Oh, I'll call.
I'll call as soon as I get
that big fat check for you.
- Hey, you know, I didn't think
you were really gonna do that.
- Hey, buddy,
I love you.
- Take a shower, okay?
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
- Wait, so you're
just gonna leave?
- Yeah, I gotta get going.
It was really great to see you,
and thanks for the pie.
- That was for dinner.
- I'll be eating dinner.
- No, for everyone.
- You're not as giving
as I thought you were.
- I don't want the pie back.
I just...
well, I guess you know ben
better than I do.
Is he gonna be okay here
by himself?
- By himself?
What, now you're gonna leave?
I mean, with that poor kid
up there?
- So he's not okay?
- He's right as rain.
I mean, his father just died,
he's got a drug problem,
probably some kind of
manic-depressive disorder,
and, honestly, he wasn't
that well screwed together
to begin with,
but he's an adult,
and I have to go back
to do the 4:30 weather.
And though you're under
no obligation,
would it be so bad to take
another two or three weeks
before you do whatever bullshit
you have to do?
- You mean
teaching disabled kids?
- Oh, now they're disabled.
Do you have any actual plans?
- I guess I could take
my time moving out.
- Great.
- You get a week,
and I'm not adopting him.
- Perfect.
I'm gonna leave you my number,
in case
you have to get in touch.
Did you know I'm on tv?
- [LAUGHS]
Yeah, actually,
sam bragged about you once.
- I think he liked you, but
he couldn't really express it.
- Yeah, it always came out
as "moron troublemaker."
he hated the irish too.
People forget that.
[CAR DOOR CLOSES,
ENGINE STARTS]
Okay, now, will you let me know
if I run over a chicken?
'Cause the pie's
all I can eat right now.
- How long
does he stay up there?
- Let me know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How are you holding up?
- [SIGHS]
I don't know.
It's all temporary, right?
- Angela, you knew, when you
decided to get involved
with a man so much older,
it wasn't for life.
- You are so sentimental.
- Okay, alls I'm saying
is that you had that experience.
Now, don't be afraid
to be with a man your age.
You got a whole time ahead.
- Ben asked me to put these up.
- I have some.
They upset people.
- Hey, ma, samuel stoltzfoos
is outside.
You have to negotiate
the lettuce with him.
- No, listen, I gotta go.
I might need my hands.
Okay.
- Hello, terry.
- Good morning, sunshine.
- It's hard, huh,
without him?
- Yeah, try to keep busy.
- Uh, about ben...
- god, don't stick your nose
in that too.
- I'm living with him, terry.
- Nobody asked you to.
In fact, I'm surprised
that you didn't
blow out of town
on the next guy
who came through.
- [SCOFFS]
Jesus, that tongue!
I think you just spoiled
all the vegetables in here.
- You know, you came
into my family very recently
and you started telling
everybody what to do,
which was nothing...
do nothing.
- That is not true!
- You convinced my father
to let a thriving business
go to seed.
"These are the good years!
Life is for living!"
I mean, christ!
A man his age
throwing himself into yoga
and guitar lessons...
- you don't believe in growing!
- You don't grow!
You're a tumbleweed
who blows around whenever
the wind changes.
- Shit, I swore
I wouldn't engage.
I gotta go.
- You know,
people hide in charity.
- Once in a while,
assume other people
are as good as you,
not worse.
- They're not.
- How was the vacation?
- It wasn't a vacation.
- Oh.
Did you get your eyes done?
- [OVER P.A.] delia
got some fan mail, you know.
- Is that right?
- 100 bucks says
delta's fan mail
came from a member
of the cafeteria staff!
- [OVER P.A.] corporate thinks
each piece of mail
represents 1,000 viewers.
- What, did she do
a really good job?
- Hey, what was with you
wrestling that bum
the other day?
Nicely done.
- So did you know him
or something?
- You know how it is.
You buy someone a cup of coffee
and suddenly,
they're your best friend.
Do I need my eyes done?
- 30 seconds.
- It would be illegal
to make them any bluer.
- See, that's what I think.
- Spinach check.
[DOOR OPENS]
- You have no whitening trays?
Now I really can't stay.
- God, it must be tough
having to win the viewers over
one at a time like this.
- You know, while you were off
getting your eyes done
over the weekend, paul flew me
to martha's vineyard
to show me this house,
and it wasn't one of those
stupid cape cod houses
the tourists love.
This was a year-round home
where you could really be
a part of the island.
Paul understands
the limitations of our job,
and, let's face it,
it's a short window
and it's not really based
on skill.
- Yeah, I know that.
Lucky for me,
my finances have kind of been
taking care of themselves.
- Sandwich guy told me
you nailed the baseball pool.
- No, really. I'm coming
into a little piece of property
up in lancaster myself.
I'll probably unload it.
Brian williams
has a place up there.
- I don't think so.
Thanks for the ride.
- Which is why I'm sick
and tired of the bullshit.
- Excuse me, sorry.
I was just passing through.
- Sit, please.
Join us.
Everybody, this is angela,
my stepmother.
- Didn't we meet
at the plastic bag rally?
Oh, your skin is so white.
- I think we should listen now.
- If we create
a non-profit society,
we can reap the tax benefits
of said society.
It is gonna be
a beginning and an ending
of life as we know it,
and that is why I'm calling it
"the omega society."
- I hate to stick
my nose into this, but...
- everyone's voice
has equal merit.
- "The omega society" sounds
like "the omega institute."
it's a holistic
organization.
Environmentalism,
spiritual rebirth.
- It's total synchronicity
is what it is.
Not only is it the perfect name
for our society,
but it already exists.
- I think there's
an omega society too,
so I don't think
legally we...
- justin, it's not
about what is legal!
I grew up out here.
There are amish people
on three sides of this farm.
They don't vote.
They don't join the army.
They don't send their children
to our schools.
When you live off the land
and you're honest,
things fall into place!
You are a beacon
to that babylon out there.
- My cousin lives in oregon.
Ben's right.
- So I've never seen you
at the marriott before.
- Oh, I really shouldn't.
- You just gonna go home
and stare at an empty dog bed?
Chester doesn't get home
from the hospital
till tomorrow, right?
- His name is "clarence,"
he got out
of the hospital today,
and my mom is watching him.
But you sure are
a good listener.
- So are you, and a very
beautiful one, actually.
- [CHUCKLES]
- [MOANS]
- I think clarence needs me.
- Seriously,
I'm really fast.
[PHONE BUZZES]
Did you give my number
to someone?
- I don't even have your...
- Shh, one second.
Hello.
- Ugh.
I really didn't mean
to bother you.
Ben's fine, but we just got
this registered letter.
Terry's challenging
the will.
- Why?
I mean, I know why.
But under what grounds?
- Well,
it's ben's competency.
There's gonna be a hearing,
and he has to see
a psychiatrist.
- Can you believe this?
This morning
the bank account was shut down.
It's a classic obstacle
to a pioneer.
It's like galileo
or che or Jesus.
Every great move
has a countermove.
But let me tell you,
my sister's greed is not
gonna stop the evolution
of mind and body
that's going on out here!
- No, no, no, look,
you need to calm down.
Just get a lawyer.
- A law...
you think I'm crazy now?
- Go see the shrink.
It's like giving them the money
if you don't go.
- I could be my own lawyer,
you know?
- There you go.
- I could prepare a brief,
one of those 600-page
obstructionist babies.
[LAUGHING] they don't know
who they're fucking with.
[PHONE THUDS]
- Hey, you still there?
- Yes.
Any other fires to put out?
- It is just getting
more and more intense,
and there are a lot of other
people involved now.
- Like you and me?
- No, I mean there are
these hippie kids now
and the store
and now this court thing.
He just seems
very agitated.
I mean, I've been trying
to deal with it,
but...[SIGHS]
I'm just glad I could call you.
- You can always call me.
- I'm leaving.
- [WHISPERING] maybe you should.
- Oh, my god,
is there someone there?
- No, I'm alone.
Now.
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.
You're just doing your job.
My job actually.
- I don't really know him.
- He's ben.
He's a blast
most of the time.
But you didn't know
his mother.
He inherited some things
that weren't in the will.
- Yeah, sam mentioned that.
- Probably nothing like
the free love,
whole foods thing
you grew up in.
- My father was an actuary
for the hartford
insurance company.
He died at his desk.
I was still at andover.
- Huh.
Like, say, about sam's age?
- What?
- So you must be loaded.
- [LAUGHS]
Is he gonna be okay or not?
- This is the way
it usually goes.
The best thing to do
is keep feeding him.
Food is nature's vicodin.
That's good too, by the way,
if you have it.
You should finally be getting
some rain up that way, you know?
- Hmm.
I'm not too sure about that.
Well, good night.
- Yeah, good night
to you too.
[THUD]
[GRUNTS]
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo!
[HORSE CHUFF S]
- Ben?
Ben?
Is he ready?
- Ben, terry's here!
I can't believe
you're doing this.
- Yeah, well, I can't believe
you're still here.
Ben?
Benji, we're going
to the doctor, okay?
There isn't anything
to be...
ben?
Great.
[INDISTINCT DISPATCHER
CHATTER]
- Why aren't you inside?
Greetings.
- Sorry to keep
bothering you like that.
- I don't think getting
a glass of water
is the biggest inconvenience
for these people right now.
- I was just explaining
my admiration for these people.
They live off the land
in kindness.
They don't believe in war
or pollution.
I'll tell you, one day,
when there's no earth left
'cause we used it up,
there'll be 10 square miles
of lancaster county
where god still exists.
- Why are you naked?
- I didn't want that
chemical smell on me anymore.
- That smell
is not chemicals.
It's b.o., 'cause you have
stopped showering,
and you ruined everything
I bought you at the gap,
which you loved.
- I don't anymore.
- We are going.
This entire incident
is inappropriate
and probably illegal,
and if I were mr. Yoder,
I would make you pay
for the fact
that I missed
two hours of farmwork
so I could ride into town
on a buggy
to get a cop out here.
- You're wrong!
We're having a conversation!
- I don't want to speak
out of turn here,
but felty and sarah
are not being hospitable.
They're pacifists,
and this is how they respond
to being held hostage.
- Gosh, I'm...
I never meant to...
i didn't...
- ben, I think you can keep
the apron.
Let's go.
Yes, the best way to get
the soda out of the bottle
is to shake it
and shake it and shake it.
Need a ride?
- Yes.
- Next time,
go over to the highway
and get anderson to ring
the fire bell for you.
- I will.
I apologize.
I might have been
in a bit of a panic.
- I am terribly sorry,
mr. Yoder.
- I'm sorry to hear
about your father.
- Thank you very much.
We all miss him, obviously.
- He was lucky to have
a long life.
Such a caring daughter.
All he cared about
was his family.
Surely, there's no other reason
for being on this earth.
- What would you do
if you couldn't have children?
- I would pray to god
to send them to me.
- What if you don't
believe in god?
- Maybe that's why
you can't have children.
- [INHALES]
[WATER GURGLES]
Honestly, ben,
you really fucked me here.
- My independence of mind
is obviously a threat to them.
- Them?
- Society.
With all their poison.
I'm not putting it
in my body.
- And I respect
that deep-fried temple
that you've built,
but you have
to stop running naked.
- I know. I panicked.
Even the most committed
messenger has a moment of doubt.
- Keep that word "committed"
in mind.
- Next time.
- Oh, you mean
in the courtroom?
Because that's where
we're heading,
and they might not stop
with the money.
They can force you
to take the medicine,
and they can lock you up.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
We're studying in here.
- Anyone hungry?
- Not really.
- I gotta go.
- Ben, you okay?
- I don't know.
I'm feeling
a little stressed out.
- I'm stressed out.
You're crazy.
Let's use the word freely
as if it gives us power.
Good night.
[DOG BARKING]
- I see you've been
arrested a few times.
Public outbursts,
indecency,
a misdemeanor
related to your profession,
which you listed here
as "small farmer."
I also see that you've
never considered medication.
- Antidepressants?
They have been suggested,
as they have been
to most of america.
- Well, I was thinking
more like a mood stabilizer,
which for most
is a very effective
therapeutic solution.
- No need to resist
the magic of lithium, I know.
We should sprinkle
its salty goodness
over the fries at mcdonald's
until we're
dawn of the dead drooling
towards banana republic,
pushing our carts, dazed,
through the market,
throwing the meat in,
black blood pooling
under so much plastic.
- That's an interesting image.
- Which I wouldn't have
if I was zonked on that shit.
I wouldn't feel this hum
I've got going,
clear, sharp,
and purposeful,
like every ion in my body
is vibrating with genius.
- Marijuana is a chemical.
- It's green
and from the earth.
- But it's a drug,
a way of dealing
with your symptoms.
- Like the drug you get
when you go into a restaurant
or come home after work
or offer a stranger the moment
they come in your house.
Our whole social system
is built around some drug.
Most cultures made beer
before they had an alphabet.
- I'm going to ask you
some questions,
and you can just tell me
yes or no, okay?
Do you experience
sensations of things
that are not there?
Do you hear voices?
Are you afraid right now?
- There are times
that are wonderful,
and there are times
that are horrible,
and the wonderful thing is,
right now, I feel alive.
But the terrible thing is that
you're not asking me how I feel
about my father dying.
- Oh, well, I was going...
- I feel alone
in the universe,
except for steve.
- So why do you think
you're here?
- Because I won the lottery.
Everybody's got their hand out.
- Now action back to barry
with his suited ace.
80,000 to call
to see a flop here.
And he will have to...
[CLICK]
- Yes, yes,
you'll clean up later.
No.
Motherfucking god damn
damn it!
[SIGHS]
Look at it, it's huge.
Leaves and acorns
everywhere.
You gotta get rid of it.
- The building is called
"the oaks."
it's the only one left.
- It's just a tree.
It blocks
all the natural light.
Plus, it decreases
the value of my unit.
I can circulate a petition
if you want,
but you know
everybody feels the same,
and you gotta be sick
of cleaning up all this crap.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Great.
That's all I can ask.
- Oh, and, steve,
thanks for the oriole tickets.
- Freebies, armin.
Don't be impressed.
- I happen to be
in charge here.
Stop asking me
where the debate is,
'cause I'm not going.
- Ben?
- We all agreed
on a starting place,
and that's where it's gonna be,
and it's not about
who's got the most, it...
[KNOCKING]
- Ben, who's in there
with you?
- Hey.
- Were you on the phone?
- No.
- My diagnosis, as I wrote,
is classic bipolar disorder,
euphoric
with schizoid tendencies.
- [WHISPERING]
see, I told you.
- So in your assessment,
dr. Vincent,
you see mr. Baker as being
incapable of understanding
any consequences
for his actions?
- Yes.
- That is all we have to say,
your honor.
- Uh, mr. Baker,
have you been
having difficulty
distinguishing
between real and unreal?
- My whole life.
- Hmm.
This is a very serious
diagnosis.
Would you describe him
as a danger to himself
or to other people?
- Actually,
I would say no,
not at this moment.
It is, of course,
completely possible.
- Well, I'm prepared
to rule on this.
Mr. baker, ms. Coulter,
I have to agree
with dr. Vincent's finding
that mr. Baker is...
I'm sorry to talk about you
as though you weren't here,
but this 11-page handwritten
brief didn't help, son.
He is seriously
mentally troubled.
And he's likely
to behave with this money
in an extremely
irresponsible manner.
But hopefully, he won't,
because as long as he's not
a threat to himself
or other people, he can
go out and buy the world's
largest hat if he wants.
[TAPS GAVEL]
- Your honor,
you don't understand.
- Look, your father could have
left his money to his dog.
The law is crystal clear.
If the government
gets their piece,
the mandates of the deceased
are to be observed.
- Ben, I'm just
looking out for you, I swear.
- No, I'm looking out
for you!
- Every time
I think you're crazy,
along comes
the justice system.
[UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC]
- Whoo!
Is this great or what?
- Yeah, glenlivet scotch
in a shit hole like this?
- I'm buying everything.
Bartender,
drinks on the house.
- My man!
- Yeah!
[SCATTERED CHEERS]
- I am not buying
everybody a drink.
- No, I think he means
drinks are on him.
- What did I say?
- Hey, hey.
My mom... my mom just gave me
the message.
Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.
It means so much.
- Yeah.
- I don't know if you ever
met my friend, steve dallas.
Steve, this is zed starkovitch.
- Hi.
- He's kind of
the chief administrator
of the whole
omega society.
- I guess we should be saying
congratulations to you.
Can we get
another beer?
- To transforming
society from within.
To being a tapeworm
gnawing on its intestines,
sucking and feeding
on the bile and waste,
growing stronger
every minute.
- Okay, I'm gonna let
you two celebrate.
Zed, can your mom
take you and ben home?
- My mom's blind.
- I'm bottling
this moment.

- Come over here.
What is this?
- What are you
talking about, "this"?
- Don't mess with me.
This.
This place and you
and you.
Your face.
- [LAUGHS]
I don't know what to say.
- Because you like me.
What?
Kiss me again or slap me

and flooding,
2 to 3 inches per hour.

makes you or not,
just get yourselves
out of there.

more important than your houses.

It's hard to resist
the temptation
to step into a normal life.

you didn't want anything.
- Yeah, I said that,
and I really meant it,
but you think he would have
just given me
just, like, one little thing.

that you could talk to steve
about the farm and the house.
I'm sure he doesn't know

- What?
