[rumbling, faint]
[man shouting]
[men chattering]
[man] Put it down,
clean it off.
Walter, there's
30 million here.
We can't sit here all day.
The customs...
We stay until
the job's done.
James, we're clear,
but it won't last.
Any sign?
No.
And there's still
one last gap to check.
Okay.
I'm going in.
No. You won't get
through with the gear.
That's not a problem.
He can't free-dive.
It's on a slope.
He's made his choice.
How long
has he been under?
Two minutes.
Craig, do you have eyes
on James?
No. Maybe he found
another...
- [rumbling]
- [gasping]
[James breathing]
[James] Were you worried
about me, Walter?
That would suggest
I cared, James.
Well, if you didn't before,
you will now. [laughs]
Bring it up.
Bring it home.
Next cage is coming.
[man]
Oh, look at it.
[man 2]
Bring it in, boys.
[men cheering]
Drop it now.
Atlantis crew,
this is Spanish customs.
Raise your hands
and prepare to be boarded.
[lawyer] Our conclusions
are irrefutable.
The Virgin of Guadalupe
was a Spanish galleon
and its remains were found
under Spanish jurisdiction.
[lawyer 2]
Mr. Moreland's assertion
that the law of salvage
is applicable is preposterous.
This was piracy.
The Spanish claim of ownership
is the only piracy here.
My crew and I invested years
in the search...
[judge] Mr. Moreland,
you have provided
no contract from an owner,
nor permission to salvage
from the Spanish authorities.
The cargo salvaged
by the Atlantic Group
is the sole property
of the Spanish Crown.
[gavel raps]
There's got to be something
the government can do.
I like you,
but I helped you
at Her Majesty's pleasure.
Her Majesty's pleasure
was half the bounty.
And now she won't
see a penny.
She'll live with it.
What if you don't
have to?
We lost.
We can't step in.
- We lost in court. What if...
- Stop. I'm not hearing this.
We've only weeks before
researchers are granted access.
How long before they
realize what they have?
Still fighting.
Why can't we just
live our lives?
I've lived my life
every day.
I mean real life,
a normal life.
Do you know how many
times I've been to Paris?
Fifty-three.
Know how many times I've
climbed the Eiffel Tower?
None.
Climbing
the Eiffel Tower.
That's living
a normal life?
It's over, Walter.
You heard where they're taking it.
[siren wailing
in distance]
Right this way.

[bell tolling]
[bell rings]
[students chattering]
Hi.
- Ah.
- Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.
Take a seat.
I hope no one else snuck in
ahead of us this morning.
- You're the first.
- Excellent.
This is a unique position
for a 22-year-old student,
but fitting for the boy genius
whose concrete bell idea
helped Best Oil with their oil
spill problem in the Gulf of Mexico.
The people.
Excuse me?
I wasn't helping
Best Oil.
I was helping the people who were
left with the mess caused by Best Oil.
Yes, of course.
[chuckles] Yes.
But what matters here is that it was
your idea that solved the problem.
You see, yours is precisely the
sort of mind we're looking for.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
So what
we can offer you
is a $400,000
starting salary.
A corner office.
Shares in the company.
A team working
under you.
I think I sent you guys
a project.
About drilling wells?
In desert areas.
With a relatively
modest investment,
you can go a long way
towards eliminating the
water problem in the Sahel.
Yes, of course.
A magnificent project.
You never got back
to me.
It's not our sector.
Do you have any idea how
humiliating this is for me?
The eight leading
multinationals,
and you shit
on their hospitality.
Because I don't want
to follow you
into the corporate hellscape
of Big Oil?
I simply told them
the truth, Dad.
And their interests just
didn't align with my interests.
Yes, of course.
Your interests.
So, what are those
interests then?
[cell phone buzzes]
[waiter]
Your main course.
Bon appétit.
Look, Thom.
You're an adult.
You can do whatever you want in
life, but you still need a real job.
[cell phone buzzes]
Save the world if that's your thing.
But nothing is free.
And those companies, they were offering
you the opportunity of a lifetime.
Don't mess it up.
- Where are you going?
- Just going to get some fresh air.
Sir? Your coat.
Thank you.
I-I didn't...

Claudia!
Claudia Valenti is curating an
exhibit on Spanish Romantics.
[in Italian]
Good evening.
[in English]
What's that?
[in Italian]
My new assistant.
[in English] Ooh.
You fly to Madrid tomorrow, yes?
[in English]
That's why I came. Mm-hmm.
You forgot to sign the official
request for inspection.
Ah. Well,
I do apologize.
- [in Italian] It's okay. Now...
- [chuckles]
[in English]
Um... here.
[man] Nice.
[Claudia] E here.
[man] Uh-huh.
- [in Italian] Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- [man in English] Have a safe trip.
- [Claudia in Italian] See you.
[in English] Now, the rest of
you, I'm going to treat...
Why did you
do that?
Do what?
Well, you stole
his wallet.
I thought you did.
Check your pocket.
[gasps]
What did you do?
Okay, I'm maybe
just very boring,
but I really don't want to get
involved with this, okay? Thank you.
Look, you can give
it back to its owner,
tell him you found it
on the floor,
and remain
a law-abiding citizen.
Make your daddy proud.
It's okay.
Or?
Be an accomplice
and come with me.
[rock music playing
on speakers]
- Fucking rain, huh?
- Yeah.
[rock music
continues playing]
See that table?
Wait for me there.
[cell phone buzzes]
Along with your father's
voice mails,
you'll hear from several leading oil
companies with increasingly rich offers.
Beer.
Don't worry about Lorraine.
She can look after herself.
Oh,
it's Lorraine now.
Enough with this cloak-and-dagger nonsense.
What's this game all about?
I'm Walter Moreland.
I'm the owner
of a salvage business.
And I have a job offer.
I want you to help me
break into the vault
of the most secure location
in the world.
[laughs]
Okay, very good.
Do I look like
Danny Ocean?
He's a, uh...
I'm an engineer.
And your idea
ended the Gulf crisis.
Where others saw futility,
you saw a solution.
It's the same
with my problem.
I see
an impossible task.
You might see
a way to overcome it.
You probably need a safecracker,
someone who actually does this stuff.
Thieves want to rob a bank today,
they use a keyboard and a modem.
Great.
Go and do that.
I'm not a thief.
Oh, really?
How do you figure?
Well, the vault,
how it works, what it is,
we can't work it out.
For 80 years,
no one has.
It's been described as a
miracle of engineering,
but we don't even know
what that means.
I need your mind,
because I'm not just looking
for a solution to a problem.
I don't know
what the problem is.
Why the hell would
you think I'd do this?
Well, aside from making you richer
than you ever thought possible,
for the first time
today...
someone's got
your attention.
[cell phone buzzing]
Your future's calling.
[buzzing continues]
Dad, uh, it's me.
Just wanted
to let you know that I'm...
going to go off.
I need to go away for a few
days, think a few things over.
[chiming on PA]
[man on PA, in Spanish]
Departure of Iberia Flight 2100
for Barcelona.
Please embark
through Gate E65.
Lorraine.
Walter was right.
I wasn't so sure.
Me neither.
[chuckles]
[rock music playing]
[horns honking]
[chattering]
[driver] Tourists?
Um...
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.
- Honeymoon.
- [driver] Honeymoon!
[driver in Spanish]
[in English] Good place,
Madrid, for the honeymoon.
Yes, right?
[in Spanish]
[man singing in Spanish]
I'll show you around
later.
They're waiting
for you. Come on.
The war room.
Hello.
Hey.
You are very welcome.
Meet the team.
In the control booth,
our computer whiz, Klaus.
- Hi.
- [Klaus] Hi.
On my right, James, my colleague
and friend of ten years.
Planning, entry, extraction.
He'll be leading the salvage.
[in Spanish]
[in English]
Look at this beauty.
Not even
on the market.
- A 3D printer?
- Yeah.
[Walter]
Simon. Acquisitions.
I'm the guy who can get things.
If you need something, just tell me.
Thom, one of the world's
brightest minds
and hopefully,
the key to our success.
He hasn't even mastered shaving, and he's
going to mastermind the infiltration?
- Mastermind?
- [James] Yeah.
To succeed where all others
have failed takes a mastermind.
Oh.
[Walter]
Klaus, are we in?
Yeah, we got the phone
line, I can listen in,
but I need an employee
voice mail code to break in.
A voice mail access code lets
you break into the system?
The Renaissance-art, genius of a
virus I created breaks the system.
- [scoffs]
- The code just lets us touch the loop.
[chuckles] Supersmart guy, huh?
Until you hear his plan
to get a voice mail code.
Have you got
a better plan?
Listen.
[electronic sounds,
indistinct]
- [sounds stop]
- He calls numbers in the bank's switchboard,
then keys random nine-digit
numbers, hoping to get a match.
It doesn't check one at a time.
It makes ten million attempts a day.
- How many combinations are there?
- A billion.
What?
Klaus, we don't have time.
Find an employee
who's out of the office,
call them on their mobile, pretend
to be one of those automated messages
telling them they've
got urgent voice mail.
They'll key in their
passcode, and you can copy it.
[scoffs] Come on.
They won't fall for that.
It's a voice mail code, not bank details.
Why wouldn't they?
Try it. Simon,
you be the message.

The moment of truth.
[whistles]
Well done, Thom.
Thom?
That's my hack.
Yes, but he made it work.
So simple.
Unpacking now doesn't mean
you can't walk later.
You'll just be walking away
with less creases.
[chuckles]
I just don't really know
what I'm doing here.
Well, the truth is
you're not off to a bad start.
[woman on PA, indistinct]
[air brakes hiss]
Ah,
another dead end.
Ah.
Do you know who
Sir Francis Drake was?
Yeah. An English sailor
from the 1500s.
Fought the Spanish Armada.
He wasn't navy.
He was a privateer.
- Like a pirate?
- Mmm, it's a fine line.
Hmm.
Drake resented his orders
to steal Spanish treasure
to fund
the English Crown.
He stole the treasure,
kept it for himself.
He buried it.
No one knows where.
Thirty years ago,
I bought this letter
from a backstreet antique dealer on
Crete who didn't know what he had.
It was written
by his first mate.
It concerns three coins
Drake had engraved
with the coordinates
to his fortune.
The coins were kept
in this coffer.
Thirty years
I've searched for that.
A year ago,
I found it on a shipwreck.
And that's what's
locked in the bank.
Drake's motto was
written on the chest:
"Sic parvis magna."
"Great things
from small things come."
Mm-hmm.
How great are the things
that come?
Untold wealth.
But it's not about that.
I have money.
Then why do you care?
I'm a hunter.
I seek what
to others is lost.
We can't explain
our passions.
- If we did...
- [people singing]
- Listen to that.
- [singing continues]
A million people gathering to
cheer for men they don't know
to put a ball
in a net.
Unnecessary,
unessential,
but it means
everything.
That's passion.
[Walter] The Bank of Spain,
one of the most impenetrable
buildings on the planet.
Every inch of the interior is
covered by cameras and sensors.
Any unauthorized movement
brings the rapid fire
of the 15 guards
stationed within.
Across the street is the
headquarters of the Spanish army,
a garrison of 500,
on alert for any attacks on the city
or any attempts
on the bank.
If that wasn't enough,
Gustavo Medina, chief of security.
Former head of Spain's
anti-terrorist task force.
What we call here...
[in Spanish]
If he makes us,
the job's off.
- How are you getting in?
- From below.
There's more tunnels under
Madrid than streets above.
James and Simon
are mapping the route.
We're not there yet,
but we're close.
And this is supposed
to be the vault?
This was a sketch
done by an ex-employee
who was in the vault
for a few minutes in 1944.
And this?
[Walter] It's some sort
of engraving.
They favored aesthetics in functional
architecture in the 19th century.
[Simon]
Catholic imagery.
Probably a martyr.
Very Spanish.
[Walter]
This is apparently a bridge,
and that gives us access
to the vault door.
That requires two actual keys
and Gustavo Medina's thumbprint.
Claudia Valenti,
our art expert,
whom you've met,
will take care of it.
Sounds like you've
got it covered.
[scoffs]
Not even close.
The vault is safety-rigged,
but we don't know how.
If we don't shut down the fail-safe
when we enter the vault...
we're not coming out.
That's the miracle of engineering
that you need to identify and solve.
Can I see
the actual vault?
I can't control
the cameras yet, only watch.
Not till tomorrow.
We'll also have a better idea of
what the vault looks like then.
We're gonna take
a magnetometer read.
Wait, you're going
in there tomorrow?
Stage one.
[ringing]
[announcer speaking

[in Spanish]
[Simon on phone]
[announcer continues
in Spanish on speakers]
[tuning frequency]
[announcer speaking Spanish
on radio]
[cheering]
[cheering continues]
[James] We have to postpone
and find a replacement.
[Walter] We don't have time.
Too much of a risk.
Going in now
is the risk.
If you're getting nervous,
you need to tell me.
Doing it right isn't
a question of nerve, Walter.
- What's going on?
- [Klaus] The security uses Interpol's face rec.
James was special forces,
so he is on the database.
The system
will bust him.
- I'm going in his place.
- You don't know how to use the equipment.
- Teach me how to use it.
- Teach you how to use a magnetometer overnight?
[chuckles] And then Klaus can
teach you code over breakfast.
I can do it.
[scoffs] Of course you
can, Cambridge.
I know how
to use it.
I'm an engineer.
Yesterday
you're a student.
Today you're brainstorming
for a complete stranger.
And tomorrow you're a criminal.
Is that right?
Thom will do it.
[in Spanish]
[in English] Gary Lineker.
[chuckles]
[engine starts]
[in Spanish]
[laughs]
They're in.
- [in Spanish]
- [in Italian] Hi.
Claudia Valenti.
[chattering]
[in English] Miss Valenti?
I'm Gustavo Medina, head of security.
[in Italian]
Pleased to meet you.
[in English]
Is it your scanner?
No. Scanner is
for reproductions.
This has
an ultraviolet light
that traces any imperfections
in the paintings for insurance.
[in Italian]
[man in English]
That's okay, Miss Valenti.
Muñoz will take care of you from here.
Miss Valenti,
Mr. Muñoz.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Could you...
- Sure.
- [in Italian] Pleased to meet you.
[in English]
This way.
Oh.
- [in Italian] Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- [elevator bell dings]
- [Muñoz] Please.
[Walter] Thom,
you're doing a great job.
Now I want you to head
to the basement level.
[beeps]
Okay, Simon. At the end of the
hall, the door on the left.
Just hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
Okay, camera's off.
Ninety seconds. Go.
[humming]
Is it your first time
in Madrid?
Mm-hmm. Yes.
[Klaus] Simon, hurry up. Lorraine
is almost at the chairman's office.
[Simon]
I've got it.
Done. Did it work?
Yes! The security system
is now our bitch.
Okay, so the monitors on the
left is what Gustavo sees,
and the right side is our focus,
what's really happening.
Here is Lorraine.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Here it is.
Our most
valuable Goya.
[Lorraine]
Wow! [in Italian]
Yes.
Well, if you need
something, extension 2871.
Thank you.
- Lorraine, can you hear me?
- [Lorraine] Yes.
Okay.
Let's record the loop.
Twenty seconds. Don't breathe.
Wait until the camera switches.
Go.
Recording.
Stop. Pretend you've seen
something in the picture.
Okay, keep scanning.
Still recording.
Got it. We will
put it in slo-mo.
The loop has been launched.
Two and a half minutes. Go.
[in Spanish]
[Walter] Great, Lorraine.
Let's go for that key. Fast.
[sighs]
[Klaus] All right, Thom.
Ten meters to your left,
there's a door.
Get closer
while I prepare the loop.
[Lorraine]
Scanning first key.
[Klaus]
Just wait. Hold on.
Camera is on loop.
Get inside. Go.
Thom, you're right above
the vault pit.
[grunts]
[beeps]
[whirring]
Okay.
It works.
[Lorraine]
Done. First key copied.
- [Klaus] Lorraine, someone is coming.
- [man coughs]
I'm not sure what this has to do with
your coming exhibit, Miss Valenti.
I cannot place
the artist.
Eating Breakfast
in Salamanca.
It's my wife.
[both chuckle]
- Mariano Bellido, chairman of the bank.
- Claudia.
Beautiful small talk,
Lorraine,
but if you're not back in the same
position in 20 seconds, we are screwed.
[chuckles]
This is embarrassing.
I was wondering...
could you take a picture
of me scanning it?
Oh, of course.
[Klaus] Now,
put your left hand an inch left.
Yep.
And get the chairman
out of the shot.
[in Spanish]
Can you take one
from the doorway?
- I want to feel the grandeur of your palatial office.
- [laughs]
Six seconds.
He's still in shot.
- [Mariano] Beautiful.
- [Lorraine in Italian] Thank you.
Three, two...
[in English]
A little further back?
It's impressive, huh?
And it will stay that way if
you stop smoking around it.
Oh.
You could see that
from the scan?
- And from the air freshener.
- [chuckles]
And the disabled
window lock.
- Well...
- Don't worry. I will not mention it.
[chuckles] Thank you.
[Klaus] Good, Lorraine.
Go for the other key.
- Shit.
- [in German] Shit.
Fuck.
Thom, you've got company.
[chattering]
Break up the magnetometer,
hide it in your clothes,
and walk out of the room as
though you've been cleaning it.
- We need to abort.
- No. We won't get a second chance.
[chattering continues]
[in Spanish]
The other Goya.
Take all the time
you need.
- Can I help you with anything else?
- No, thank you.
Okay, then.
[Klaus] Okay, Lorraine.
Gustavo isn't on you yet. Scan fast.
[in Spanish]
[beeping]
[stops whirring]
Scheiße! It's frozen.
- Fix it.
- [exhales]
- Thom can surge the power, but...
- The pulse will trigger the alarm.
[in Spanish]
[whirring]
[alarm blaring]
[in Spanish]
[computers beeping]
[in English] What the fuck is that?
Fifty seconds left.
[in Spanish]
[guard]
[guard 2]

- [helicopter whirring]
[alarm blaring continues]
Chairman's on his way.
Two seconds.
Miss Valenti, this way.
Come with me.
[man on PA
speaking Spanish]
The building's on lockdown.
They're moving everybody to the foyer.
Big problem.
The safe is still open
and the key's in my hand.
- Miss Valenti! This way, please.
- Thank you.
Well, I'm calling it.
Time to panic.
Simon, I need you to go
to the comptroller's office.
[man on PA in Spanish] Please,
remain inside the building...
[in English] That's a problem.
I'm in the foyer.
I'm not.
Where are you, Thom?
Bottom of the stairs.
What do you need me to do?
How's your catching arm?
Absolutely terrible.
Lorraine is going
to throw you a key,
and you're going
to have to catch it.
There's no margin for error.
If it hits the floor, we're all screwed.
Lorraine, on three.
Two.
One. Now.
Good job.
- [Thom] Now what?
- Okay, Thom, turn left 15 meters.
You will find the back stairs.
Go up. Third floor.
Third door along.
Thom, there's a guard approaching.
You've got to hide!
[in Spanish]
[in Spanish]
Thom, if you have
any other hidden talents,
could you please let us know?
The kid's got balls.
[in Spanish]
[Muñoz on phone]
[Thom] This is the
ground floor of the bank.
This is a few hundred
feet of earth and rock,
and then this part...
soft, wavy lines, out of focus...
this is the vault.
And then an empty chamber
below it.
The model's all hard lines,
precision.
I just don't understand
why this part isn't.
Maybe the scanner shifted.
No.
Below it's solid.
The scanner just can't
figure out what to put in focus.
Water.
It's a tank of water.
The soft part.
The vault sits
under a tank of water.
Shit.
He's right.
Explain.
The water is the trap.
The tank funnels through these pipes
here, flooding the vault.
But that doesn't stop
someone robbing it.
You could swim in.
Or scuba.
No. Because of the empty chamber.
Under the vault.
You see these teeth here,
either side?
That's an actuator. Gears.
Rack-and-pinion gears.
When the vault floods, the whole
thing sinks down into the chamber.
And if it's in the chamber,
no one gets in or out.
But what makes it sink?
What triggers it?
[Simon]
Lasers, maybe.
- Motion.
- No, too modern.
Whatever it is,
it was designed 70 years ago.
Hang on.
It's been in front of you
the whole time.
The engraving.
It's not a martyr.
Justice.
Exactly.
Lady Justice.
[James] So?
So, when they built this,
they didn't have sensors
or motion detectors,
but they did
have scales.
If there's the slightest
change of weight in the vault,
the whole thing floods
and sinks.
And if you're inside,
the vault dispenses its own justice.
It drowns you,
the vault.
The miracle of engineering.
It's one giant
weighing scale.
And it's genius.
A giant scales.
So what's the solution?
I don't know.
But we know
what the problem is.
[man in Spanish]
Fuck.
Another dead end.
We're only
30 meters away.
[sighs]
Wait.
[rumbling in distance]
You hear something?
[rumbling intensifies]
[grunts]
[grunts]
[Simon] Copper base.
Support structure.
[James]
Kid was right.
It is a scale.
We must be directly
under the vault.
The pit must be
over there.
[shutter clicking]
[device beeps]
[chimes]
Oh, shit.
We're fucked.
- [cheering, shouting]
- [announcer speaking in Spanish on TV]
[announcer speaking
in Spanish]
[James]
Steel plates...
titanium-reinforced
concrete...
and a Dyneema shell.
What does that mean?
To drill through this wall
to the pit will take 15 days.
We have eight.
Use a bigger drill.
I'm not bargaining
with you, Walter.
At 800 psi,
this wall will take 15 days.
Drill harder,
and we trigger the alarm.
[glass shatters]
[door slams]
[sighs]
That's it? We're done?
We're not gonna try
and figure out another way?
Walter will pay you
for your time.
Sorry you wasted
five days of your life.
[crowd cheering
in distance]

[dogs barking in distance]
[Simon] Walter, if I'm not gonna be
rich, I could at least watch the game.
Simon, come here.
We can't break in from below,
but we can break in from above.
[James] Walter, we spent weeks
mapping the route from above.
We abandoned it because there's too
much exposure from the CCTV cameras.
Except when Spain plays
its World Cup games.
When the crowd gathers
in Cibeles Square,
every camera will be pointing away
from the building, toward the crowd.
It'll be like that
for the final,
which gives us 105 minutes
to get the job done.
This is your route,
James.
From the Zurich building,
through the dome, through the vents.
Is that still viable?
If the cameras are pointing
at the crowd, not the bank,
then yeah,
the route is viable.
So everything depends
on this match?
Yeah.
[inhales]
[tuning]
[announcer in Spanish]
I just wanted to remind you
that we've still got a problem.
My problem.
The scale.
I'm still no closer
to finding a solution,
and the final
is four days away now,
half the time
I was meant to have.
Well, I have every faith
that Spain will get there.
And I have every faith
in you.
[Simon in Spanish]
[laughing, shouting]
It's all on you now,
Thom.
[announcer]
I'm sorry. So sorry about that.
[laughs]
[announcer]
[cheering]
[in Spanish]
[computer chiming]
[in English]
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
[in Spanish]
Drink that,
and you won't sleep.
I'm drinking it
so I won't sleep.
You've been awake
43 hours.
You won't figure it out if you
break down with exhaustion.
Great work.
[chuckles]
[Walter] He'll be fine.
I put my faith
in him.
You've put fear
in him.
Think what it will do
to him if he fails.
- He'll take a job with GranCo Oil.
- Not if he does have an idea.
What if he does
and it fails?
He won't be
anywhere near it.
But we will.
And that's a risk we agreed to take.
But you're asking him to
put our lives in his hands.
Every voyage, every
salvage, every dive,
we all ask the crew to take each
other's lives in their hands.
He's not your crew.
He's a college kid.
You're worried about him
because he's a college kid?
Or is it
something else?
[Gustavo in Spanish]
[exhales]
[sighs]
[door closes]
Thom, do you have
a criminal record?
Huh?
Okay.
He's clean.
- Simon?
- I've never even had a parking ticket.
If it wasn't for my birth certificate,
there'd be no proof I even exist.
[Walter] Then an image search
won't turn anything up.
What's going on?
You fucked up when
you surged the power,
that's what's
going on.
Walter's right.
We haven't been made.
We haven't been made?
Gustavo Medina knows someone's after
the vault. The place is a trap.
We can monitor
the trap.
Walter's right.
[mocking]
"Walter's right."
Are you capable of having
a thought of your own?
Yes. When I agreed to do this
job, just like you.
Since then, all I've heard
from you are reasons to run.
Why did you come aboard?
Loyalty.
Yeah? To whom?
Stop.
James, we go on
with the plan.
They know we want to get in,
but not how we'll do it.
Thom, you figure out
how to crack that scale.
[in Spanish]
[ringing, buzzing]
[woman] Walter.
How's the Eiffel Tower?
I'm a little south
of Paris.
Really?
How far south?
Eating paella.
And I need
your help.
[chattering]
Walter, you know
where we stand.
The government's hands
are tied, and you know it.
Fifty percent,
Margaret.
All I need you to do
is tell a lie.
And I know
you can do that.
[chuckles]
[chuckles]
[inhales sharply]
[knocks]
[sighs]
[mutters]
[knocks]
Hi.
I'm kind of busy here,
Lorraine.
What do you want?
A drink?
Wash your face
and put this on.
I'm not asking.

So you said he was like
a father to you?
My real father
worked for him.
He died
when I was eight.
So Walter told my mom
if I ever needed anything,
he'd be there.
She died
when I was 12.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't easy.
I was angry all the time.
None of the foster homes could deal
with me for more than a few weeks,
so I wound up
on the streets.
Three years.
Then Walter appeared
and tracked me down.
He kept his promise.
Lorraine...
what if I'm steering you
off a cliff?
[woman singing on speakers]
You're too smart,
and you overthink.
I looked
at your ideas earlier.
I don't understand them
at all.
But you know
what I do understand?
Using an automated message
to get the phone passcode.
Yeah, but simple
isn't always best.
More often than not.
- Look.
- [chuckles]
You can drink a cold
beer on a hot day,
or spend eternity watching this
guy spin bottles like an idiot
and get a glass
of smoky red bullshit.
You can, um...
be a victim
of fashion,
or you can look
sexy as hell
in a plain
gray shirt.
How much money
do you have?
Can I?
Right?
Now watch this.
And...
The weight
didn't register.
- You froze it?
- Metal's always frozen, James.
But, yes, I've further
slowed its atomic activity.
I've tricked the scale.
And this will work
on the vault?
Same principle. Bigger scale
needs more nitrogen, but yeah.
We'll just need someone in the chamber
below to freeze the scale before we enter.
It's genius,
Thom.
No.
It's simple.
[Simon clears throat]
Thom...
what do we need?
Thermal lances,
a fire suit
and 500 liters
of liquid nitrogen.
- Five hund...
- [sighs]
Okay,
I'll figure it out.
Well, this is all well and good,
but as long as someone's in the
chamber spraying liquid nitrogen,
then we're one short
in the bank.
I'll go
in the bank.
No, we need you up here
running the show.
Yeah.
I've asked
a lot of you,
but would you be willing
to go to the chamber?
- No.
- It's the least amount of exposure.
Walter,
he said no.
I'm not going in the chamber.
Simon is.
I'm going in the bank.
[scoffs] There's no way
I'm taking you in there.
I'm not asking.
- Who put you in charge?
- Walter did.
When you brought me in here,
this became my responsibility,
and I won't be responsible for their
lives without putting mine alongside them.
[James laughs]
Let me make this clear so I'm
absolutely sure you understand it.
We can't escape through
the tunnels anymore,
so we'll go in and out
through the roof.
And everything
before the match finishes.
There's no plan B.
If we get caught,
we're going down
for a very long time.
Are you sure you're
prepared for that?
Are you?

[Thom] Are you sure it's a
good idea to be doing shots
the night before committing
the crime of the century?
[chuckles]
No regrets.
It's tradition.
The night before
a dangerous voyage,
sailors would
drink rum
and voice one thing
they regret.
[Klaus]
Okay, I regret...
that one night in Thailand when
I woke up next to that ladyboy.
- [laughs]
- What?
It's not funny.
Okay, I'll go.
Um...
I regret...
I won't be able to watch Spain
win the World Cup with my father.
He dreamt of it
his whole life.
But if he can't be here
to watch it,
I'll listen to it
on his old radio.
Maybe that way
he can hear it...
with me.
Thom?
You don't regret joining
us on this salvage?
No, that's one thing
I don't regret.
Do you mind me asking
why you did accept?
Passion.
And because
it was impossible.
Lorraine?
How about you,
James?
This is our 14th
salvage,
as you like
to call it.
But it's a big one.
No regrets.
[all] No regrets.

Okay, guys, it's halftime.
Sixty minutes to get out.
We're ten minutes late.

Klaus, the codes.
[Klaus] Okay,
the codes change every 33 minutes.
We got six minutes before I
can try grabbing the next one.
- But you can grab them?
- That's the billion-dollar question.

- Six.
- Six.
- Three.
- Three.
Seven.
Seven.
One. Just one more.
How's my time?

Twenty-one minutes left.

Simon,
how many liters have you used?
[Simon]
Eighty percent.
Twenty left.
Should it have
worked by now?
Yeah.
But it hasn't.
[sighs] Fuck.
Simon,
how much left?
None. That's all of it.
Well done.
Wait.
You want to see
what I see.
[laughs]
[Lorraine]
It's working.
[chuckles]
Right.
Hang on.
I'll go first.
If I'm wrong,
it's on me.
[creaking]
The scale hasn't moved.
It worked.
[Walter] Move fast. It'll only
last a few minutes. Get to work.
[beeping]
[in Spanish]
Guys, this thing's melting fast.
[guard in Spanish]
[wings flapping]
[Lorraine]
"Sic parvis magna."
I found it.
And the coins?
Walter, you need
to see this.
[Walter] Fuck.
[in Spanish]
[guard]
What do you mean
we've been made?
[Walter] They've found
the hole in the dome.
- Fuck.
- They know you're in the building.
- The guards have been mobilized.
- What do we do?
You need to get out of the vault
and surrender to the guards.
No, no, we can't.
There's got to be another solution.
You have to surrender,
and do it clearly,
or the guards will shoot you.
[creaks]
This is not gonna hold!
We have to get out! Now!
Wait.
What?
Give me the coins.
[Walter] What are you doing, James?
We've lost. It's over.
Not for me, it's not.
Give me the coins,
Lorraine.
Give them to me.
- What the hell does that mean?
- [James] You were never going to get the coins.
They've ordered me to bring
them to the British Embassy.
[Walter] They? Who?
You know who.
- You should have seen it coming.
- I thought you retired.
We never retire,
Walter.

Give him the coins,
Lorraine!
Give him the coins,
Lorraine!
Oh, shit.

What are you doing?
There are a handful
of people in the world
that could
make that swim.
And you're not
two of them.
I'm sorry, Lorraine.
Really, I am.
[quietly] Fuck off.
It's over. I'm calling the bank.
They can stop it.
[Thom]
There's no point.
This thing
is autonomous.
It won't stop
until the vault's filled.
[panting]
[gasping]
Thom, listen to me.
There's nothing we can do from here.
You think
we don't know that?
[gasping]
[Walter] Thom, Lorraine, keep calm.
We'll get you out of there.
You have around ten minutes before
you're submerged. Ten minutes.
- Okay. Okay!
- We have to get out!
You studied the 3D model.
You know it.
There has to be a way, a route.
Okay!
Okay, can everybody shut up?
Shut up! Shut up!
I'm trying to think.
Okay. Okay, Thom.
Let's keep it simple.
Basic laws of physics.
The water will stop coming
when the vault's full.
It has to, otherwise the
pressure would burst the vault.
Great.
But that won't save us.
There's no sensors in here
to detect the water level,
so how does it know
when to shut off?
The weight.
The weight. The weight!
Simon!
- Are you still down there?
- Yeah, sure.
Okay, pile as much weight
as you can onto the scale.
Come on, please!
Come on!
[in Spanish]
[grunts]
We have to trick the scale
into thinking the vault's full.
It's all about the scale.
It has to be.
[grunts]
[creaking]
[panting]
What if you're wrong?
[in Spanish]

The water's
still rising.

I'm sorry.

[Walter] Okay, guys,
we'll get you out of there.
Walter,
there's no way to get out.
What do we do?
I don't know. Just stay in the room.
There's no cameras.
They'll find them in five minutes.
Get them out of there.
To where? The whole building
is crawling with guards.
There's no way out.
They can break
a fucking window.
[Klaus] The windows are bulletproof.
They need keys to open.
Fuck.

we are as well.
You really believe all that "for
queen and country" bullshit?
And I believe
in doing my job.
You used me...
from the beginning.
We knew you were going to do it.
We could not.
All right, let's renegotiate...
60-40.
You have nothing
to negotiate with.
James has the coins.
And an obscure
sense of loyalty.
You need to disappear.
You'll be at the top of
a short list of suspects,
and we can't protect you.
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.
As I said,
country first.
Wrong.
Friendship
and family first.
Gentlemen.
- Do you have the coordinates?
- Just a moment.
Tougher
than expected...
but I have them.
Care to do the honors?
It's in Europe.
[chimes]
France.
Paris?
Shit.
According to this,
Francis Drake buried
his fortune under the...
Under the Eiffel Tower.
Yeah.
He switched the coins,
that clever fucker!

[Lorraine] I told you
I don't want to get wet.
[Thom] So...
you knew this whole time that James
was going to try and screw you?
I thought he might.
He's a good man,
but he gave his loyalty to a flag,
and the code of honor
that goes with it.
How did you manage
to switch out the coins?
What do you think?
Oh. I don't know.
I was there the whole time.
I didn't see anything.
[Lorraine] Of course not.
- Hmm.
- [Thom] Okay.
[Simon] Okay, full house.
Here we go.
- [laughing]
- Come on.
All right.
Europe.
One of us is going home.
It's buried in London.
I guess that's a sign
I should call my dad.
Where in London, Klaus?

Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Where?
