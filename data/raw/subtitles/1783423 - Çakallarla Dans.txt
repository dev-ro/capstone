DANCES WITH JACKALS
Saving your presence, friends...
I've been feeling
like a shit lately.
If they throw me out to...
Marmara...
Aegean...
Black Sea...
...and even Mediterranean...
I would create an
environmental pollution.
I am in such
a grave trouble that...
...if I am used
as a fertilizer and...
...spread out on the fields...
...the harvest would be
greater for 40 years.
Every little boy wants to be a man,
some will remain large and some small.
If you want to be a man
and you have not enough,
you will always be small. Always small.
Come on, tell us.
You know that
horny barber, right?
Hüseyin?
Yes. Yesterday I went
his barber for a smooth shave.
I must have fallen
asleep for a while.
When I woke up,
I felt heat on my arm.
First I didn't recognize it.
I said to myself, "C'mon idiot,
don't exaggerate it".
Then I noticed that the thing
causing heat is getting hard.
Hüseyin?
Is this good enough for you?
No, I still have to work
on the side whiskers.
That is not what
I am talking about.
Why don't we just pull this towel
off and feel each other's flesh?
We both will be
more comfortable.
Sorry about that.
I took a pill last night.
It is hell of a strong pill.
I haven't experienced
anything like that before.
So what did he do exactly?
Have you felt it's stiffness?
- You almost bruised my arm.
- Really?
Son, come and replace me.
In the meantime let me
shoot my load and be back.
Do it carefully!
- Keep your body away from me!
- Alright.
We have known him for years
would you expect this from him?
Do not make stuff up.
You must be high or something.
Look, I have gone to
his barber all my life.
He has never touched me,
not even once.
Cut the crap. What shall we
do about Beykoz business?
- What is the deal?
- 250 per head, net.
- Do we know them? - They are
bank employees, all jacklegs.
Listen, accountant, I have
said this thousand times.
I am not interested in
the financial side of this.
I consider this
as an sportive activity.
That is what it is
all about, anyway.
We will sweat off and
get rid of our toxins.
- If we win, just donate
my share to a charity. - Sure.
What if that inglorious Metin
does not show up?
I phoned him this morning,
he is unreachable.
My apprentice, Lokman
can play instead of him.
How about his arms?
Who is winning?
Somebody give him ice
for his arm to cool off.
For his right or left arm?
Give him ice cream on me!
- Are you trying to skin me off?
- I apologize, Fatma.
Shut up and go on.
Get out of my sight.
Fly Ahmet, fly my son!
Go, go, go!
Shit, I lost again!
What is so funny?
Turn the damn TV off.
You continue...
Fatma, you are worse
than your husband.
At least, Servet
gambles once a week.
You do it every single day.
Oh dear, everybody is
talking about your husband.
They say he can't even
run because of his alcoholism.
What are you chatting about?
Is it your boyfriend?
- What is he saying?
- As usual.
Listen, you should not
spoil your man.
You never know, he suddenly
begins to boss you around.
I have spoiled Gökhan and
now he is never around.
But still you have
this settled life.
Listen my words and play
hard to get or else you suffer.
Look who is dancing!
Look at these hips!
Let me join you.
Don't Gökhan!
- I don't want.
- It'll take just 5 minutes.
- I know all about your 5 minutes.
- Don't you want me anymore?
- So you don't desire me anymore.
- Let me go, you are hurting me.
Come on, move it.
My darling!
BROTHER IN LAW GÖKHAN
My brother in law has opened a
bottle of wine again, greeting me
My brother in law is making
a barbecue again, greeting me.
Meatballs on the barbecue.
BACK IN 5 MINUTES
My brother in law is spelling
the name of the wine.
Do not drink too much,
stop talking nonsense.
Give that damn meatballs,
if you will.
Do not drink too much,
stop talking nonsense.
Give that damn meatballs,
if you will.
Let's dance for joy and
celebrate our victory.
It was a good game.
Well done, my boy.
What the hell are you doing?
Here is the money.
I am donating yours.
We scored goals and
got the money.
We will go to a night club
and celebrate our victory.
Move your hand.
God damn you!
I dropped by to the store,
you didn't show up for 5 hours.
Who knows where
the hell you were.
Necla, sweetheart, I attended
the retailers meeting.
Who the hell are you? A CEO
of a beverage company...
...or a liquor store owner?
You idiot!
- Neco!
- Do not call me Neco!
Don't make me crazy,
you piece of garbage!
You are still trying have
upper hand shamelessly!
I will rip off your body!
Chief, I had to deal with
a pick pocketing case.
Well done, take a seat.
I want you to work together
on this operation.
Yücel, you are the
head of this operation.
- Sinem, you'll help him.
- Yes, sir.
You have the same authority.
But sir, Sinem doesn't have
any operation experience.
- Therefore it will be too risky.
- There won't be any risk at all.
- But she has the same authority.
- That's why you'll work together.
Sir, I do not understand.
- Did you get it, Sinem?
- I got it, sir. I'll explain you.
Have you ever
wiretapped before?
For wiretapping, you
should be fast and...
...practical and able to
use your instincts.
At school, I had technical
tracking course and...
...received a certificate.
But that is the theory,
what matters is the practice.
Look, wiretapping is a door that
opens to the world of secrets.
First, you should find
the weakest link...
...then put it all together.
And then the gang is busted.
- Handsome! How is the
wiretapping going? - Fine, Recai.
I was just instructing that
to my new assistant.
All the procedure is set.
As soon as we are
approved by the...
...prosecution office,
we can start.
Are there any information
about the previous...
...wiretapping operations
in the file?
Previous wiretapping operations?
Anyway, let's start.
Write it down.
It is your home number!
Why are you writing it down?
Do it properly, stop
dancing around. You fag!
If authorities show up,
they would fuck us all.
Pick those cigarette
butts from there.
I start with the name of God.
Salih, we are making money
by making these smaller.
This is too big.
- 300 gr.
- What? 300 gr?
That is too much. Take this
piece off, now it is 280 gr.
We shouldn't let
people eat too much...
...dough at this hot weather.
I am addicted to this, grandpa!
Just wait and see
how I'll pull it off.
I would purchase a cabrio...
...and a dozen of
girls around me.
I am addicted to this, grandpa!
MEATBALL NECMÝ
Busters, we are going to
bake the best bread ever.
Sesame bread, whole
wheat bread, black bread...
Lokman, give me the music.
Fire up the oven, Salih, let us
feel the heat till to our bones.
How it's going
four eyed Smurf?
- Give me 2 breads. - Please,
try to be a bit more polite.
- My dad wants 2 breads.
- It is 2 TL.
There is no money,
give me the breads.
If there is no money,
there is no bread.
My dad said,
"Don't pay that asshole".
What the hell are you saying?
People say you are spending
all your money for women.
All neighborhood knows
what you are up to.
Get the hell out of here,
you bastard!
I'll rip your ass and
break your skull, you fag!
- Give me my bread, jackal!
- No bread for you! Get out!
- See you around, dear.
- Kisses, dear.
Oh, God!
He broke the window down!
If I catch you...
He broke the window down!
- Sir?
- What are you looking at?
Where the hell are you?
Don't run, bastard!
- If I catch you...
- What is happening?
Tell your daddy,
go fuck himself.
Inglorious!
Meatball, what happened?
You seem hopping mad.
Don't ask, buddy. He pushed
my button at this hour.
Let alone my head is wounded.
What about you?
All right, calm down.
I am not in the mood, either.
Come on, let's have a tea.
- What's wrong with you?
- Take a seat.
- What happened to you, man?
- Don't ask!
- As I was working this morning,
guess who dropped by? - Who?
We are so dead!
- Del Piero Hikmet!
- Welcome Bahattin Aða.
- Don't butter me up!
- Sir...
What do you have to do
with Bahattin Aða?
Don't interrupt! I am
telling. Get us 2 teas.
Last Friday, the prayer on
the mosque was extraordinary.
There were so many people.
People prayed in such
a perfect way...
...I did not see
anything like it.
The Hodja preached in a way that
no one could hold their tears.
Even as I am telling you now,
it gives me the chills.
He preached about friendship,
sharing and compassion.
As I was leaving the mosque,
someone called me.
I turned around, guess who?
- Bahattin Aða?
- Inglorious Metin.
- Fuck! Where the hell has
he been? - Stop interrupting me!
Where is the tea?
May Allah accept
your prayers, Hikmet.
Metin, bro,
where have you been?
Long time no see,
long time no hear.
- I am done with earthly
pleasures. - That's great.
I've forsworn, bro.
You look like you are reborn,
let me kiss your holy beard.
- My dear brother.
- Hikmet, you can't imagine.
I am really changed
and evolved.
- I am planning to open a
retail store. - Good luck, bro.
God willing!
- We will sell pilgrim stuff.
- Wonderful!
- The suppliers demand
down payment. - Sure.
I thought it over.
I know you wouldn't mind
to write me a check.
How much do you
need exactly?
Did you do it?
I wish I had not written
it for that inglorious!
Thank God, I have Hikmet.
Look at this!
Let my beard feel it.
It makes me itch, damned thing!
- Fuck! What happened next?
- Next I am fucked best.
Shut the fuck up horse
meat, let me finish!
- Do you know what kind of people
I like most, Hikmet? - What kind?
Those who write
a check for favor...
...and pay it when
the payment is due.
What else can I wish for?
I swear, Metin will call
today and we will pay you.
It is best if I call him
myself, just a second.
Use my phone,
I have the cheapest rate.
Don't tell anyone, though!
INGLORIOUS METÝN
It is ringing.
It is Del Piero.
Shot and goal!
It says " The person I've called
can't be reached at the moment.
You know what they say?
Those who vouch
are doomed for misery.
- Smally, start the film.
- What film, sir?
Action, thriller and adventure.
Look how he is burning.
So you burned him
alive just like that.
I wrote and directed this film.
- I am the producer, too.
- Bravo, it is great.
If a film achieves a great
box office, what happens next?
- What?
- There will be a sequel.
Hikmet, I give you 2 days.
Either give me my money or
be my lead actor in the sequel.
I got it. Don't worry,
I got the message.
Be cool, I will
take care of it.
DEL PIERO HÝKMET
These man will burn
the fat of my ass. Oh, God!
Give me a glass of water.
What are you looking at?
Get me some water.
And you do your job!
You are in deep shit, man.
You know what?
If you can't find 30.000 TL...
...you'll continue your
football career afterlife.
- Are you fucking with me?
- Not at all, buddy.
Here is an advice for you.
I know, you are not
the man for this.
But if you sniff a piece of
this shit, you'll be free as a bird.
I say Ankara, you say
my ass is like baklava.
- Hide it, what are you doing?
- What do you want me to do?
If I had, I'd give you
30,000 TL right now.
But this is all I have
and offering it to you.
- You'd better appreciate it, faggot.
- Put it in your pocket.
I told you not to bring
this to my store.
It will curse my business.
- Don't you dare to leave it here.
- Why am I so giving, anyway?
- What's up, accountant?
- Meatball, open your ears.
- Wednesday, at 20:30, at Babayiðit.
- Babayiðit?
Right. I have so much
to do, honey. Kisses.
- Servet?
- Yes, sir.
- Servet, sweetheart.
- Mr. Adnan.
- Listen, if I am wrong don't
hesitate to correct me. - No way!
- But if I am right, we'll continue.
- Yes, sure.
Take a seat.
- Are we supposed to pay 300.000 TL
as tax? - Yes, more or less.
- What we'll get against, a medal?
- Of course, not.
Listen to me, Servet.
What is money?
Money equals to what?
- Well, you know what.
- Money equals to power.
- Of course.
- Let me tell you a story.
Many years ago...
...those were the days.
- Weren't they? - Why are you
laughing? I've not told anything yet.
You were about to tell,
so I felt like smiling.
Look at this bonehead!
He is confessing everything.
You are making a mess.
In short...
...if you'll make me
pay that much tax...
I'll enter in your ass!
Did you hear me?
Servet, take care of that.
C'mon, come and get inside me.
Servet is waiting for you.
- Servet, did you say something?
- I'll take care of it.
ACCOUNTANT SERVET
Will the court accept
all these as an evidence?
If it was that easy, there
wouldn't be anyone left out.
We have to catch
them red-handed.
Gökhan! My love!
- You said you didn't
want me, Pelin. - My love!
- My love! It's Servet,
I must answer. - Don't.
I have to. Hold it
close to my ear.
Gökhan, where are you?
This note says...
...you'll be back in 5 minutes,
but you aren't around for an hour.
Servet, I am coming.
- I am coming, bro. - He'll be
there in 5 minutes, Servet.
- Coming!
- I am coming!
- I am coming!
- Coming!
I came!
- Servet, what is the matter?
- Listen to me, carefully.
From now on,
watch out your actions.
- What? Did Necla find out?
- Fatma.
Last night we were
having dinner.
Usual family dinner.
Honey, you don't understand. I've
been doing this job for many years.
I've never betrayed my country.
So what? We are living in a
home no bigger than my ass.
Mümtaz has bought
a terraced house.
Mümtaz is a worthless
and dishonest man.
Do you want me
to be dishonest?
He is not dishonest at all.
He knows how to cover things up.
Can't you just
make an exception?
Honey, I can't have
ill-gotten gains.
Your honest gains
do not get us anywhere.
For 5 years, your honest
gains turned my life to hell.
I won't pocket that tax
money belongs to the state.
I didn't say that. You won't
pocket the state's money.
You'll pocket your
damned boss money.
My boss is not stupid.
Are you crazy?
Don't you know my boss? If he
finds out, he will burn me alive.
If you touch the flame
with your hands...
...of course you are burned.
You should use tongs
while dealing with fire.
My foolish husband.
Come closer, my little darling.
My pumpkin.
You know the passwords of the
internet accounts of company, right?
Right?
Right.
- Say "Yes" Servet.
- Yes, right.
If something goes wrong,
you'll blame hackers.
- Will I?
- You will.
- Can I?
- You can.
Come on, take it out.
Take it out.
- At this hour?
- Take it out.
- On the table?
- Take it out.
My husband, my man!
Fatma, I love you so
much, my precious.
What do you want me
to do exactly?
Bro, what is written there?
Bank account number and
password. - Yes, my company's.
What we are going to do is that...
...as soon as I call you,
you'll be online.
You'll transfer 300.000 TL from
our company's account to yours.
Then we'll share the
money and get lost.
Where? Maybe to Spain,
France, Holland, Germany.
- Russia!
- Yes.
Lithuania, Latvia,
Ukraine, Romania.
Don't be silly
are you crazy or what?
Answer me like a man.
Agree or not?
Adem, I know I am an idiot.
I shouldn't have
written that check.
Can't you support me a bit?
All right, Adem.
Good night.
I know 30.000 TL
is a lot of money.
I swear, I'll pay you back
in a month. I promise.
Aunt Mükerrem.
That's it.
I am hungry.
Get me double Kurdish pie
with plenty powdered sugar on it.
Aunt Mükerrem.
How are you?
My mom is at the hospital,
she has cancer...
...we need money
for getting her out.
Can you lend me 30.000 TL?
You are broke, too?
In that case, she
is not getting out.
All right, good night.
Mom is right to call
her Slut Mükerrem!
This yoghurt drink is too thick.
I do not like it that way.
Add some water in it.
I said I want it with a
plenty of powdered sugar.
Why did they packed
this sugar so tight?
The best meal ever.
What's wrong with me?
What did you do?
Hikmet, what did
you make me eat?
Hikmet is me. Necmi,
did you leave it here?
Did you put it all?
What did you make me eat?
Close the store.
My god, I feel hot all over!
Why the fuck am I running?
I am exhausted.
No, I am not. I am OK.
Bus stop.
I need to get on the bus.
When is it going to arrive?
- Does this bus go? - Yes, it
goes slowly from the right lane.
- To Kadýköy?
- No, Taksim.
- Oh, God. I am going to Taksim.
- Hold it, where is your ticket?
Ticket? Where is my ticket?
I'd better get off. Here it is.
What are you doing?
Are you crazy or what? Get off.
- I gave the ticket.
- Get off.
Don't want to. Please, let
me come with you to Taksim.
- I said "Get off".
- Let me go to Taksim.
Wait a minute,
my shoe is stuck.
Driver! My door is
stuck in your head.
- Necmi?
- What's up, Hikmet?
- Lokman, where is Necmi?
- No idea, he left half an hour ago.
He did not say anything?
What the fuck am
I going to do now?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.
All right, why are
you shouting at me?
Baker!
Bahattin, can I please
answer my phone?
OK.
- What is it, Hikmet?
- What am I going to do?
What are you talking about?
You left some stuff in my
store and I ate all of it.
What stuff, bro?
You left it on the counter
and I ate it with the pie.
I feel terrible as if
I am going to blow up.
All right, listen to me.
Go to my office.
You go through the door.
Open the last drawer
of the closet...
...near the table that across
the safe next to the door.
You will find a bottle
of cologne there.
Smell it and apply it
to your face and wrists...
...I am sure you'll feel better.
What the fuck are you
talking about? What safe?
- OK. Lokman, you get lost.
- OK.
Where is it?
He said "Table".
Table, table...
Fuck the safe, near the table!
The Devil's powder!
You ruined my life!
Necmi!
Please, stop.
Look how he is burning.
Bahattin, I swear I didn't touch
1 gr of that stuff this time.
Why do I give that stuff to you?
So you can deliver it. But last
time there was some lacking.
Yes, you are allowed to take
some of it for your personal use.
But you have gone too far, Necmi.
Never ever do it again!
- Deliver it properly tomorrow.
- All right.
- Is Babayiðit OK?
- OK.
What am I going
to do with these?
- Mum!
- Calm down, son.
Oh Lord, be gracious upon me!
Don't do it, son.
What kills an eagle is the
arrow made of its own feather.
Oh my God. What the
fuck is wrong with me?
My dear son, there is nothing
like a clear conscience.
The end of it seems...
Seems what, uncle? You
started the sentence, finish it.
Shitty!
I knew this would happen to me.
Bestami Hodja!
Thanks so much, uncle!
You are a saint.
Thank you very much.
- Bestami Hodja!
- Son, you stay out of it.
Bro, is Bestami Hodja available?
- What's it? - I have to talk to
him, it is very important.
- Come on in, he is inside.
- Thank you very much.
- Sorry to interrupt. May I enter?
- Of course, approach.
Thanks, Hodja.
- I am in trouble, maybe
you can solve it. - Go on.
I lent some money to a friend.
But he did not pay me back.
And now I am being
punished for this.
That's the way it is, fellows.
Every favor done for God
may not always end up well.
So what should we do?
Should we give up doing favors?
No. We will go on.
You are right, but
the mafia is after me.
Who is that mafia?
Bahattin Aða. If I don't pay
him back, they will chop me off.
I have fallen into
temptation and sinned.
May God mercy on us.
Yes, now I get it.
Leave me alone with Hikmet.
Son, we are trying to lead the
young ones to the right path.
We tell them to stay
away from 3 whites.
Drugs, alcohol and adultery.
So you mean those
are the 3 whites.
Of course.
Listen to me Del Piero...
I hope you did not touch these.
God forbids!
How could I?
But I have done
something unintentionally.
I found myself tasting it.
That's not good. I want you
to go back home right now.
Pray to God for forgiveness.
Throw up and forswear.
Then I will check if
God has forgiven you...
...and then I will
burn this all.
- All right?
- Whatever you say, sir.
By the way, you know I have
always served for the community.
I need money badly,
if you can lend me...
...30.000 TL for God's sake,
I will pay you back.
For God's sake.
Excuse me, then.
Good night, brother.
Sir, we hit the
jackpot this time.
If you let me, I want to go
deeper in this investigation.
Are you sure?
I hope this will not end up
like the transvestite operation.
Transvestite?
Come on, move it!
Hands up! Don't move!
Aynur, if I always meet
these handsome policemen...
I will not move for
the rest of my life.
That would be great, sweety.
Of course I am sure, sir.
The accountant we have tracked
down turned to be a gang member.
Gang member?
What gang?
A new one called, Babayiðit.
What do you think, Sinem?
Yücel is acting with
his instincts, sir.
But sir, the instincts
are very important.
- Right?
- Yes, that's why I agree Yücel.
I think we should go deeper.
- Why?
- Why?
Because they are
going to meet tonight.
That's what we found out
from the wiretapping process.
Sir, the whole gang will
come together tonight.
We must not miss
this opportunity.
Let me bust the gang.
I mean, let us bust the gang.
If you fail again,
I will give your mouth...
...a whistle and assign you
as a traffic warden.
How is it going?
Necla! I am fine and you?
Fine.
Are you going to the bazaar?
What bazaar? We are going on
a long holiday with Servet.
So I bought myself a bikini,
monokini, somethingkini etc.
- Really? Where do you plan to go?
- We have not decided yet.
I say "Majorca", Servet says
"Venice". Those kinds of places.
Has your husband robbed
a bank or something?
That is so funny!
What robbery?
I have to go, see you, bye.
Gökhan, don't make me crazy.
Tell me, did you do it?
I am in a bad mood, bro.
Fuck your mood.
Tell me, Gökhan.
I am cross with Necla.
Who cares your marriage?
Tell us about the mission.
Please don't get on me!
We were having dinner.
Are you trying to get
me crazy, you garbage!
You are still getting
the upper hand shamelessly!
I will rip you off.
Crazy woman!
You are making me crazy,
come here! Don't run.
Let me go, Hüseyin.
Stop it, what are you doing?
Hüseyin, I will blow his head up!
Yeah, right.
I want a divorce, Neco!
You go home I will talk to
him and you go inside.
Gökhan, that's not
the point, get to the point.
I know, that's not the point.
Servet, listen to me.
Gökhan, marriage is
like a castle.
The ones on the outside
want to go inside.
The ones in the inside
want to go outside.
Get it?
I missed my late wife,
Mualla so much.
May God rest her soul,
it was an untimely death.
What castle?
What Mualla?
Cut the crap.
Did you do it or not?
At that moment Servet called
me for getting me started.
- Did you do it?
- I used Hüseyin's computer.
You didn't say anything
to him, did you?
Don't be ridiculous, what am I?
A big mouthed housewife?
So you put it in your account
and mission accomplished.
- Yes, almost.
- What do you mean, man?
- Almost.
- What is it? Tell us.
- Bonappetit.
- Thanks.
Are you playing a video game?
No, I forgot to pay a bill.
I am paying it online.
- Stuttgart.
- Pardon me?
My cousin called me
from Germany.
He said "Stuttgart
will surely win...
...sell everything you have
and bet on this game...
...in favor of Stuttgart".
What are you saying?
3 times more. I bet 100 TL
and will get 300 TL.
That's my weekly
booze money.
We are talking
about Stuttgart, man.
- What time is the kick off?
- After half an hour.
In that case I can
bet on it online.
But please don't say anything
to Necla. She would screw me.
Don't get me wrong, you are
a little drunk now, you know.
What am I?
A big-mouthed housewife?
I withdrew the money and
bet it on to Stuttgart.
They had won the last
6 games, can you imagine?
We are betting 300.000 TL
and getting 900.000 TL.
We got it?
Stuttgart has started
the game so well.
They scored a goal
in the first half.
- 90th minute it was still 1-0.
- So?
900.000 TL was
almost in our hands.
Hamburg was attacking to score
a goal, Stutgart was defending.
- Then...
- Don't say that you lost.
Because of that faggot referee.
Van Nistelrooy threw
himself in the penalty...
...area and the referee
blew the whistle.
- That wasn't my fault.
- Gökhan, bro. My good friend.
- I will fuck you so bad.
- Me too.
- Fatma!
- Shut up, I will fuck you too.
God damn you, drunken shit!
I told you we should not
do business with this asshole.
Come here, don't run!
Unfortunately that was my destiny.
Loosing in the last minute
and beaten up by women.
I had only one safe port.
Nothing much, that's
life, you know.
Beard, Sinem, today may be
an ordinary day for our force...
...but it is a big day for us.
Come on guys, duty calls.
Here you are, Hadji.
Thanks.
I've heard that your team
is playing this evening.
Sinem, increase the volume.
They won last 17 games.
Although they played
against stronger teams.
Dereboyu fucked them all!
Look at my brave soldiers!
They are my lions.
- Bahattin, where is the game?
- At Babayiðit.
- Against whom?
- Wacko Recep's employees.
They screwed all the teams
they played for the last 12 games.
That's why the bets
are so high.
100.000 TL from me.
But just for the first half.
That's what my senses
are telling me.
Adnan, you don't seem interested.
I think this time you should do it.
Bahattin, I am a finance person.
If I bet on 300.000 TL
what will I get at the end?
If they lose, nothing.
If they win, you get 600.000 TL.
- 600.000 TL?
- I have won 3 million so far.
Do these guys
benefit from this?
Don't be so funny, Hadji.
Don't let small people think big.
Of course they get some
pocket money.
Team captains sort out
financial matters among themselves.
If they would have known
about these high bets...
...would they even
play like this?
Bahattin, I understand
all of this...
...but what if they
figure this out?
Do not awake sleeping
ducks let them quack...
...do not look a gift horse
in the mouth enjoy your ride.
As I've told you before, this
is just a simple betting gang.
Didn't you hear? He said
"My soldiers" and "17".
Why do you think he said "17"?
Because they haven't
lost last 17 games.
- Wrong. I think this is
a secret code. - Of what?
The date of a coup.
Sinem, why don't you understand?
Dereboyu, ducks, horses and
most importantly quack.
- Quack? He said "Quack".
- Quack.
And the crossroad they
will meet is Babayiðit.
Yücel, let me ask you something.
Have you lost your mind?
I am considering all the
possibilities, that's all.
Don't think too deep, Yücel.
When was the last time
you cried, Sinem?
I think, now.
I am addicted to this, grandpa!
Where are you, Meatball?
You handsome!
Move back to your place.
What the hell are you
doing here, jerks?
If you are a stapler,
act like one.
All right, let's get
back into business.
What is it?
The delivery.
Camera.
Fire!
I swear I did not take it.
I swear I did not steal it.
Someone must have taken it.
I did not sniff them.
Baker! This will be the
movie of the year.
Don't do it.
I am burning.
Bahattin, don't do this.
Necmi!
I am not worth it.
Please, don't do it.
- Lokman!
- Yes?
Where the fuck
are my packets?
- Where are they?
- What packet?
- Where are they? - Please,
don't hit me. What packet?
Why do you blame me?
I will fucking kill you,
I will beat you up to the death!
Where the fuck are my packets?
Please, don't hit my legs.
I have a game tonight.
Fuck your leg, fuck your game!
Where are the packets?
You broke my leg!
Tell me Lokman or I will
kill you! Where are the packets?
I swear I know nothing.
Lokman, I will fucking kill you!
Last night Hikmet was here,
maybe he took them. My leg!
Hikmet?
Hikmet!
Hey elders, hello children!
I have a new story for you.
If I stumble, excuse me.
A kindness is never forgotten.
One should content oneself.
Life is nothing more
than a short line.
Honesty, honor, dignity are
all good things, for sure.
But the most important
thing is honest gain.
Hikmet!
If you think the grass is
always greener on the other side...
if you throw out a herring
to catch a whale...
... you suck at life
with this point of view.
And one day you find
yourself as a nobody.
God, I don't deserve to live,
please forgive my sins.
I am coming to you.
Hikmet, open the door!
Hikmet, open the fucking door!
Thank goodness!
Open it!
You mercy me and sent
me the angel of death.
Thank you God.
Hikmet! I will kill you,
you maniac! Open it!
My dear brother.
Where are the packets?
What did you do with them?
Speak!
Where are the packets?
Choke me, my brother.
I can still breathe.
I couldn't do it,
but maybe you can.
What kind of a maniac
are you, Hikmet?
Choke me, kill me.
Stop it, you maniac!
Where are my packets?
Just tell me that.
If I tell you,
would you kill me?
If you tell me, what is the
point of killing you, you freak!
In that case,
I won't tell you.
I will fucking kill you.
Where are they?
I gave them to
Bestami Hodja.
- Choke me.
- Fuck!
Why don't you choke me?
Just kill me!
God damn you, Hikmet.
Don't curse at this house.
- Evils out!
- Evils out!
Sit up straight.
You, lucky guys! They are
all here, don't you worry.
Hodja, I thought you were
going to burn them all.
My son, you know we have
the ability to see the future.
- So we take measures in time.
- All right, Hodja.
What is all right?
Hodja, I know this fool
has made a fool of himself.
But I think we should not
make a big thing of it.
Let us get the
packets and leave.
Only God gives
without getting, son.
What do you mean?
Last night I had a dream, fellows.
Guess what my dream was about.
You are playing soccer.
I can't tell you enough
about the way you play.
Those shots, those goals...
My gifted boys,
the moment I woke up...
I prayed God and
made a vow that...
...if you win the first half
I will donate something.
What is to do
with our packets?
Son, just win the first half
and leave the rest of it to me.
You will have your packets.
Besides I will vouch for you
against Bahattin, God willing.
Thanks, Hodja. But still
this is so weird for us.
What is the first half
to do with this matter?
I couldn't understand.
Hikmet, son, if he asks this
question, I would understand.
But how could a religious man
like you demand an explanation?
Don't you know the
meaning of the vow?
Of course, I know.
I understand perfectly.
What the fuck did
you understand?
I will explain you later.
Excuse us, see you later.
See you, come with me.
I got it, Hodja.
How could you be so naive?
You spoil these jackals and
they boss us around like that.
Forswear!
Do not offend God!
Offend God?
Didn't you hear him?
He just made it up everything,
his dream and seeing the future.
He is so fake. You can figure it out
by just looking at his ugly face.
Cut the crap.
Go ahead.
- Move!
- What?
What is it, Mr. Adnan?
Servet, are you a womanizer?
No, sir. Never.
What about alcohol
or drug addiction?
- Never, I swear.
- In that case are you going to...
...stick the money you stole
from me to your ass, you animal?
You are insulting me,
Mr. Adnan, Shame on you!
Did you brought me here
to insult and break my heart?
How could you blame me?
I work so hard for the company.
From the early mornings
till the late evenings.
So do you want me to tell you
everything and upset you?
Hackers are unstoppable nowadays.
Passwords are so easy
to crack and you tell me...
How could you?
You motherfucker!
I will throw you down!
Want me to throw you down?
You are telling me bullshit.
gokhanyilmaz@gmail.com
He owns a liquor shop in Kadýköy.
He is your childhood friend.
You play football
every weekend, you liar!
You are so dead!
Please, forgive me Mr. Adnan.
That was all
because of my wife.
Fatma, you fucked me up.
Stand up!
What kind of a man are you?
You betrayed your
wife in 2 minutes.
Son of a bitch!
What should I do with you?
What?
Kill you or what?
For God's sake, don't kill me.
Forgive me, I am begging you.
I'll give you...
What?
- A last chance.
- Yes, sir.
- You are a goaly, right?
- Yes, sir.
Listen, no matter
what you do...
...don't concede a goal
at tonight's game.
- What?
- No goal.
- Goal?
- No goal in your goal.
- OK, no goal.
- Did you hear me? No goal.
Fucking asshole!
Faggot!
Who do you think you are?
What do you think
you are doing, Servet?
For once in my life I
am not thinking, I am doing.
Where are you going?
I am running away, I don't care
if you come with me or not.
So you think you will save
yourself by running away?
- You idiot!
- How could you say this, Fatma?
You got me in this deep shit
and now I will save myself.
Like you can fucking do it!
That man will find
you even in the hell.
Besides, how can you
leave me like this?
- Looser!
- Fatma!
- Imbecile!
- Fatma!
- Crappy!
- Fatma!
- You call yourself a man?
- Fatma!
What should I do now?
Where should I go?
We were standing
on our own feet.
Who are we to dance
with the jackals?
Fatma, I love you so
much, my precious.
My darling husband. You
always underestimate yourself.
You are not aware of
what you can achieve.
However, the truth is
you have huge balls.
- Are you aware of it, now?
- Yes, totally.
Servet, you are my man. You
can achieve whatever you wish.
- Can I? - You can, my love.
You can, my hero.
Listen to me, the best is to
settle with the other team.
That asshole wanted you
not to concede a goal.
He will benefit from
this, for sure.
Servet, don't you see?
Something is going on.
You will rig the game
and concede goals.
Concede goals.
Concede.
Then we'll get the money and
run away together, my love.
Fatma, what about the team?
Fuck the team.
Every man is for himself.
This accountant seems
to be an idiot.
Maybe, but still he might be
one of the leaders of the gang.
- Why do you think that?
- Look what he is doing.
He is a brave man.
I am brave, too
but he is illegal.
You've entered between
us like a black thorn.
Get your daughter and
put her in a sack.
Swing it over and
hit it to a wall.
You idiot, how could you break
his leg on the day of the game?
- Why?
- What else could I do?
He is supposed
to be my apprentice.
But he does not clean
the store like he should.
At the end I will be the
one that pays the fines.
- Servet is late, fellows.
- He has a bad mood.
- What is it?
- His wife is pushing his limits.
Servet is a very good man.
But his wife changes him.
Women are all your problem.
What kills you is women, fellows.
Look at me, no woman no cry.
No chat, today?
Are you cross?
I came to my senses.
I am playing hard to get.
Well done.
Keep between us...
Gökhan and I had a
serious quarrel last night.
We were disgraced
before our neighbors.
He had put the make on me
before, but I did not let him.
I wish I did.
A woman should be flirtatious.
Fun to hang out with.
She should shake a little
in front of her husband...
...and make him melt down.
Behlül, you made me look like
just like Marilyn Monroe.
I am so beautiful. May God
keeps evil eyes away from me.
Do you think you are
a desirable woman?
A woman should be
like a sand watch.
You should put on weight.
Else your husband will
find a chick like her.
Then you will drink
day and night.
- What's up, man?
- Where have you been?
- I've forgiven you.
- Really?
Are we ready for the game?
We are getting
1.000 TL each, net.
- Servet, we do have a problem.
- What is it?
- This idiot broke the kid's leg.
- I did.
Really?
Is that your problem?
Even your problem is
sweeter than honey.
Even your problem is sweeter
than honey, Meatball.
Look at his sweet moustache.
Stop it, are you high or
something, Accountant?
We'll go to Adem and he will
arrange us a black footballer.
Adem? They say he is in the
business of human smuggling.
No, that is not true.
It is only a rumor.
Del Piero kicks
the ball and goal!
Del Piero kicks the ball!
Del Piero keeps going
from the right wing.
Give him some water.
Let's get out,
I cannot breathe inside.
What on earth did this
black footballer come from now?
It is getting complicated
even more.
It is not getting
complicated at all, Sinem.
On the contrary,
the gang is getting loose.
What do you mean?
To catch the criminals,
you should think as one.
Murat, do we have
any shoe polish?
Are we getting into
shoe shine business?
Best thing to do
is stepping in the gang.
And even being one of them.
I am going to be the
black player they are seeking.
Business is different now
than it was, fellas.
It's the football,
that's the football.
That is what it is now.
Everyone is being followed.
- It is becoming uglier.
- What? Followed?
- What if we get into trouble?
- Stop it.
Don't get us confused.
He will come and play for an hour.
Then he will be paid, that's all.
Which position?
- In which position do you
need him? - Midfield.
And you are insisting
on the black.
Let me show you something.
Professional footballer catalogue.
For example, here it is,
he is Chinese.
Hong Li. When he plays,
he turns into Messi.
Adem, we understand.
But you know...
If a team has a black
player he causes...
...a negative psychological
effect on the other team.
If we get a Chinese guy
instead it won't be the same.
What is this obsession of
black guys like some woman?
For instance, Þah Muradov.
You know he is Chechen.
A warrior type.
Just like Gattuso.
Chechen works for me.
At least he is Muslim.
No, we need a black guy.
They play well and make
our life easier on the field.
You know so many Africans,
just find us a black guy.
Even a fake watch
seller work for us.
What do you think?
Is it OK?
No, it isn't.
- Why not? - It didn't match
with your bone structure.
- Is it the only problem?
- Blacks have broad nose...
...big eyes and thick lips.
- Yours are not like that.
- What about now?
I have a better idea.
- When and where is the game?
- At Babayigit, 20:30.
I'll come up with something.
You go now, I'll
send you someone.
Thanks, man.
What will be my share, Servet?
They say Adem is in the
business of human smuggling.
What if we get into trouble?
Don't be silly.
Everybody talks shit.
We won't smuggle anyone,
We'll just play football.
OK. Mustafa, God speed.
Good luck.
I am looking for Mr. Adem.
That's me. What is it?
- Hello Mr. Adem.
- Hello, welcome ma'am.
I am writing an article about
authentic coffee houses in Istanbul.
I heard your coffee is
very popular around here.
Thanks, which media?
The Side. It is a daily
political newspaper.
Let's make an interview with
you and take some photographs.
Of course, the fame of my
coffee is beyond the country.
No doubt.
Shall we do it here?
No, let's get the neighborhood
to our background...
...and take some beautiful
pictures. Shall we go?
After you.
Mehmet, I have photo
shootings, you carry on.
What is so funny, pig?
- How is business?
- Good.
Come this way, I can take your
photographs in front of the van.
- It'll be perfect.
- Of course, ma'am.
- Is it OK?
- Yes, I want a big smile.
- Great! One more.
- Is this good?
I have a photo shoot right now.
I'll take care of you later.
Should I wear my glasses?
Don't you recognize me?
I am Makoene Kuboni
from the police department.
You are coming with us.
But I have a photo
shoot with the lady.
I will take your photographs
there, don't you worry.
- Don't be so rough, be gentle!
- Get in!
Anyone hungry?
Darling, you will concede
all the goals, right?
All right, Servet? My love
will concede all the goals.
My hero will concede all the goals.
My sweet husband, my brave man!
I am addicted, grandpa!
We will smash up everyone.
We will smash up everyone
and win the game.
They are calling. Talk as
we said or I'll ruin you.
What's up, Servet?
We are at Babayigit,
where is the Arab?
Don't worry, he'll
be there soon.
- Who is he? - Makoene Kuboni
from South Africa.
- He is great, you will
like him. - All right, then.
I'll send your money
after the game... Hello?
Well done.
Take him.
Give it to me.
Don't push me!
Who do you think you are?
Adem has sent
us a South African.
I hope he know
the kickoff time.
If he is not an imbecile,
he will not be late.
Necmi, they say the other team
is good at passing the ball.
Don't play rough,
don't get red card.
OK, I get it.
Listen to me. You
pass them one by one.
Go from the right wing,
remember the last game.
Fellows, we play vertically.
From left and right,
long passes.
You pass the ball to Veli.
He is good at shots,
don't play by yourself.
All right, we play
with long passes.
Del Piero, shall I apply
starter oil on your calves?
No, thanks.
I am ritually clean.
What's it got to do with it?
Meatball, what about you?
If you will not touch me,
go ahead.
Hello guys.
Who the hell are you?
- Makoene Kuboni.
- Who?
- Makoene Kuboni.
- What is he saying, Servet?
- Adem sent me.
- You are not black.
I am South African.
White African.
I told you Adem would screw us.
There is no white African.
Come here, come closer.
- Are you a Muslim?
- Thanks to Allah.
- Do you play football at all?
- That's what I do.
- Are you good at it?
- Very good.
There is nothing to do.
He is all we have.
He has to play.
Wait a minute.
Hüseyin is our team Dr.
New players have to be
examined by him, ok?
He will examine you.
Go inside.
- Hüseyin, please. - I should apply
ointment on you. Follow me, son.
Doc, please go ahead.
Come on, let me
check your calves.
Lie down. Good.
We are at the field.
What about you? Over.
- Is that all, Hüseyin?
- Yes, that's all.
I am always ready to serve
for sports and sportive people.
My mission is over,
it is time to go.
I hope you'll win.
I have things to do.
Thanks, man.
His wife Mualla has died
at such an early age.
Arab, come here.
Listen, always pass
the ball forward.
Pass the ball,
get the ball.
If you lose the ball,
help your defense.
Always move back and forth...
The jackals are here,
chatting on the tribune. Over.
Their position is at 3 o'clock.
Have you delivered
the money, Recep?
Aða, we are not amateurs.
Just like we have agreed on.
The money is at bailee.
- What brings you here?
- I am a secret fan of yours.
Thank you, Hodja.
I thought I could support
you with my prayers.
Hodja, we have not lost
for the last 17 games...
...without a single prayer.
Our style is different.
I hope your prayers
won't have a reverse effect.
- Son, do you believe in God?
- Kind of.
Good, put that bottle down.
Come and line up behind me.
Go ahead.
Take this, come on.
They are sportsman too.
I start in the name of the God.
Lord of the universe...
...may these men get out
of this dressing room...
...walk along the
corridor and...
...arrive the field
safe and sound.
May this team be successful
technically and tactically.
Let them spread
on the field...
...definitely beat
the other team...
...at least during
the 1st half.
Aða, the dope is coming
at half-time, right?
Recep, just like we have
agreed on. We are not amateurs.
May our left and right
wingers be like a storm!
May Del Piero Hikmet header
the ball to the high corner.
May Lord of the universe
except our prayers.
Come on boys. Step the
field with your right foot.
Thanks for your prayers, Hodja.
Come on!
Dereboyu!
- Hello!
- Hello, welcome.
- I have some money to change.
- Of course.
Can you change this?
- This is fake, ma'am.
- Fake?
It is impossible. Check
again, maybe it is the light.
- Unfortunately, it is fake.
- Check this, too.
- The same.
- What about this?
I am sorry,
these are all fake.
I have to call the police.
Please stay here.
Don't be silly. No need to!
They don' belong to me.
I've found them on the street,
I'll give them back.
Hang up!
I like being rough in football.
1: Don't play like a girl.
2: I rarely blow my whistle.
So don't make me
take it into my mouth.
3: Don't even try to object
me or you will get the card.
After all, this is just a game.
Let's enjoy it altogether.
Mind your own play.
- What are you doing, you maniac!
- Look at the game.
I am going crazy. Why did
we stop? Move it.
What do you want me to do?
Fly over it?
Fly, do something.
Why don't you move?
Make the defense, Kuboni!
What did I tell you, Adnan?
You backed the wrong horse.
You suck tonight. You don't
even make an attempt to save.
What are you up to?
- We are playing with
no defense. - What?
- You are not marking any one.
- What are you talking about?
Where is the defense?
- That was a foul!
- No it wasn't!
Gökhan, get out now!
Gökhan, mark him!
Inglorious bastard!
Bastard!
What are you doing here?
Guess what? That bitch
has written to me.
You have been together
for 7 months.
Get her the fuck
out of here.
After the game I'll
explain everything.
Shameless! How could
you do this to me?
Do not touch me!
I will see you later!
Get her out!
Follow her!
C'mon put yourself together.
Meatball!
To the back pole!
That's it.
Well done.
Gökhan, play defensively.
- Easy, man!
- Shut up, you fag!
Arab, mark him.
Handsome, if you repeat it
again you'll get the card.
Gökhan, my love!
I am here!
Why didn't you
mark your guy?
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?
Yes, honey.
I am crazy for you.
Get her out of here, too.
You are playing with my life and
I am playing with yours, sweety.
I am trying to play
football here.
- I love you so much, my love.
- I love you too.
My love, my love!
Your love life has fucked
us all. You finished us.
What's me got to do with it?
It is all about Bestami Hodja.
He has prayed for us
and now look at us!
They are kicking
goals nonstop.
Fuck your love life!
The adulterer, the sinner!
Hey, Kumpampa. Come here.
Why don't you play man to man?
Let me play as a striker,
I assure you I'll score goal.
Do whatever you want.
You are the man, Arab!
What's wrong, Recep?
You are the one, Arab!
Yes, Yücel scored a goal,
the score is now 3-3.
Over.
- Penalty!
- Yes, it is penalty.
You have the balls, Arab!
Who will kick?
Del Piero?
Gay referee!
It wasn't penalty!
Faggot!
The score is 4-3.
Over.
Come on referee,
end the first half.
Look at the board, Recep.
I love your way of blowing
the whistle, ref!
Half time is started
Bestami Muco is departed.
I'll get the money and leave.
You have fun.
For God's Sake!
Bestami Muco,
you are under arrest.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Son, does your beard
need a prayer?
Goal-keeper, come here!
You got the money,
keep your promise.
Or I'll shoot you, bunny!
Concede the goals.
Shoot me!
Come on!
Pink panther, come here.
Yes, Mr. Adnan?
If you concede another goal,
you will concede my balls later.
Come on, then.
Hodja is taken care of.
Carry on the operation.
What did you do?
You asshole,
you made a penalty.
What else could I do?
If I let him,
he would score the goal.
He may still save it.
- Servet, come here.
- What's it?
The money is fake.
They have fooled us.
- What?
- The money is fake.
Goaly?
What's going on?
From every corner,
some lady turns up.
- Ma'am, please leave here.
- Sorry.
Sorry, something important
has come up. You are right.
We are waiting for you.
The money is fake,
don't fool yourself.
Come on, go and check it.
My lad! He is a
real panther, Bahattin.
Fatma!
What do you mean?
Are you leaving, Recep?
Aða, wait for me,
I'll come back to you.
Here it is.
- It is flour.
- Yes.
Didn't you check it before
taking it? Are you kidding me?
But this is not our
first deal with him.
We thought he
would not deceive us.
You are so dead, Bahattin.
Enough!
Screw you all!
- You are so fucked. - What goal?
Our goal-keeper is shot, you fag!
They shot Servet!
Everybody down, face ground!
What's going on?
Don't move!
Shit!
OK, calm down.
Do not move!
Don't move. Take them.
They shot Servet,
they shot him!
Officer, there is
something wrong.
Handcuff is not right.
What?
What did you say?
Take them.
When will you
buy me a dinner?
Should I buy you a dinner?
I saved you. You should
buy me a dinner.
All right, then.
Compassion, peace and trust.
Long live The Turkish Police!
After you.
Come on, spill it.
We were playing soccer. Suddenly
the jackals invaded the field.
If I am to blame for anything
it is to cheat on my wife.
Sinem, could you
turn on the light?
Look at them, Gökhan Yýlmaz.
Do you think these men
are capable of making a coup?
What coup?
Turn off the light, Sinem.
Don't tell me bullshit.
Gökhan Yýlmaz.
You are a small gang
belongs to Babayiðit.
My mission is to get
the enemies of democracy...
...like you out of the country.
Am I an enemy of democracy,
just because I cheated on my wife?
Shut up!
Can't you think anything
else other than your dick?
You cheated on your
wife and it is a matter...
...of time you will
cheat your country.
Well-said, Ms. Sinem.
My ear!
They are torturing me!
They blew my ear up,
it is bleeding.
Don't shed crocodile tears.
Stop it!
Illegal betting, drugs trade, fire
arms, human smuggling, prostitution.
You think we are fool?
We busted Babayigit gang!
Torturers! This woman
blew my ear up!
Take off that uniform.
I want clean football.
I won't.
You cannot even run.
They are torturing me!
I want a lawyer!
Worthless shit!
Breaking news!
Not a day goes by without
another gang is busted.
Today, under the operation
of Istanbul Police Department...
...crime evidence belongs
to Babayigit gang...
...has been captured in
a bakery in Kadýköy.
Have little respect to
enlightened people of this country.
Thank you, Mehmet.
Babayiðit, which is highly active
in and around sports clubs...
...where teenagers
drop by very often...
...seems like a
simple betting gang...
...but in fact is a
threat to our democracy.
Metin Gýcýr, whose code
name is Inglorious...
...is the leader of the gang
got caught in Bodrum.
Saving your presence, friends.
I have been feeling
like a shit lately.
If they throw me out to...
Marmara...
Aegean...
Black Sea...
...and even Mediterranean.
I would create an
environmental pollution.
It is not about being
the jackal, son.
What matters is to
dance with the jackals.
You are right, man.
Are you talking about
the jackals, again?
And you approve him.
Don't listen him. Is there
any cold beer around here?
What beer? Are you crazy?
This is prison.
You weren't complaining
while asking for advice.
The jackals are all outside.
And we are here.
- They are on trial, too.
- What trial?
They are released pending trial.
- God knows best. - But he is
not the judge of the court.
Forsworn, Servet or
you will offend God.
I am not. If I forsworn
am I going to be free?
May God forgive you!
The day I walk out of here
I am going to have endless fun.
Fatma, I love you so much,
my precious, I missed you so much.
Here it comes, again.
Fatma, I cannot do without you.
My nights are dark and empty.
Calm down.
People are honest
where I come from.
- We don't harm anyone.
- The same here.
All right, then.
Calm down.
- I am getting you out of here.
- Fuck you! How dare you?
I'll kill you!
God damn you!
Let go of me! Asshole!
What are you doing?
Pull yourself together,
be reasonable.
Look, we are all here.
This is our fate.
The universe is working
for us. This is a sign.
Gentlemen, let me
tell you something.
We have to unite.
Even if we'll be find
not guilty at the end...
...the trial itll
take at least 2 years.
Can't you say anything
positive at least for once?
Calm down.
Listen to me.
What do we need to survive?
Money.
Do you want to
earn money here?
Mostly.
Probably.
Absolutely.
Definitely.
That's what I thought.
I'll arrange soccer
games for money.
Tomorrow, at noon, at
12:00. At the backyard.
Five players. Get ready.
If we win the game...
...pedophiles, rapists,
then thieves...
...and politic criminals
will want to play with us.
It will rain money.
My palms itching so bad.
Itch it.
Are you in?
Works for me.
Me too.
What about you, Gökhan?
Come on, then.
Dereboyu!
- Where is the ball?
- I'll find one, don't worry.
If only I could have one beer.
Let's start practicing.
Fatma!
We are fit since the
minute we were born.
