Good evening, El Paso and Juárez.
Tonight at Ray's Auto Shop,
Gigántico will face El Topo from El Paso.
And then, the exótico you love to hate...
Big Beltrán!
Check this out!
Muscle as pure as fresh milk.
- Fresh milk? You're tripping, buddy.
- Screw you!
What's up, mi chavo?
Hey, Pete, what's up?
You say hello to your rival?
He doesn't want to prepare?
No, of course not. Okay.
Hey, Mole!
Do you like digging holes
or getting your hole dug?
What's with the shitty mustache?
The mustache?
I grew it for you, honey.
I heard you like the way it tickles.
Ooh.
You should take off your mask
and become an exótico.
Gerardo, why are you always late?
Talk some sense into him.
- Kiss! Kiss!
- No fucking way!
From the sacred lucha libre ring
at Ray's Auto Shop,
it's my pleasure to introduce
The Executioner of Tijuana... Gigántico!
In a spectacular mano-a-mano against a guy
who only goes out at night!
The most abominable creature
from Madrigal Street...
El Topo!
Topo! Topo!
Hold onto my shirt, buddy.
It's the only one I have!
Let's give them a show. Follow my lead.
Eat my ass!
Get him! Get him!
Listen carefully, little mole.
You strike me as the kind of guy
who likes to get down on all fours!
El Topo bites the pillow!
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner of this amazing battle,
The Executioner of Tijuana, Gigántico!
That guy has no poetry. None!
He doesn't fool around,
he gets to the point. Unlike you,
making an ass of yourself.
Pretty good, mi chavo.
Next week, we'll do it again,
you and Gigántico.
Again? With Gigántico again?
Come on, Pete, we-we always
do the same. Come on.
You want to wrestle or not?
Don't go to sleep yet, Ciudad Juárez.
The night is just getting started!
The rival in this face-to-face
draws his strength
from the flutter of butterflies
and brings his exótico style
into the ring.
Big Beltrán!
Fuck off!
- Get off the ring!
- Faggot!
Uno, dos...
Uno, dos, tres.
It's over, ladies and gentlemen!
The exótico has lost.
Hey, Saúl. Go ahead.
- Yeah?
- Go ahead.
Okay.
Look at those earrings.
And that nice, shiny ring.
Do you think that would look good on me?
The earrings, or the limp?
You!
The earrings, smart ass!
She's gonna kill him.
She'll cut off the oxygen.
Mom, is Jezebel fixed?
I got her running last night.
Just a broken hose clamp in the clutch.
Are you going to help me
drop off these clothes?
In a minute, but look.
I still need to mend all these.
Some are missing buttons...
My hard working son.
A boy will make you happy one day.
Just don't end up with someone mean.
Hi, sweetie.
Are you the new maid?
What's your name?
Count the clothes,
make sure nothing's missing.
It's all in there.
When has that happened?
What's your problem?
You've been so nasty lately,
what's the deal?
Come on, Mom. Let's go.
How much are they paying her?
Half what you make, probably.
That's why I told you
to keep your legs closed,
so you don't end up with a bastard son.
Let's go, Mom! Come on, hop on.
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right.
That's right. That's right.
Same time tomorrow. Good job.
Yeah, well done!
Wow.
Hey, you want to practice
or you just watching?
I've seen you fight at the coliseum.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Lady Anarquía.
- Sabrina.
- Saúl.
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.
You fight there, too?
No.
No, um, I've been doing
some nights at the...
Yeah.
My students fight there sometimes.
I don't think I've seen you.
How long you been doing lucha?
Since I was a kid.
But I've been doing real fights
since a couple of years ago.
But I'm gonna be fighting
Gigántico de Tijuana next week.
And I want to flip it.
I want to turn it around, you know?
I wanna get that bastard. Take him down!
Make him sweat.
You're hungry.
- You willing to work?
- Ey.
Come in here.
- Sure?
- Yeah, come on.
Come on.
Let me guess.
You're always cast as the runt?
Yeah. They don't see nothing else.
Yeah? What's your lucha name?
- El Topo.
- "El Topo."
So cute. Cool?
Fuck.
You okay?
Think I can work with you.
No, but I-I can't.
- I have no money.
- Shut up.
- We'll figure it out.
- No, I'm supposed to...
We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.
- Come back tomorrow.
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
Got to go pick up my daughter.
Do you know how-how many
sessions it'll take me
to be as good as you?
A hundred.
At least.
Okay.
"Topo."
Okay. Laps. Run.
I want four laps. Run 'em.
Faster. Come on.
Come on! Move it! Move it!
Faster!
What are you gonna do?
Come on, stand up.
Get up faster. Flip again.
Come on. Great, great, great.
Fall, fall, fall.
Stretch it out.
Stretch it out, Saúl. Come on, come on.
- That's right.
- One, two, three, four, five,
- six, seven, eight...
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Four, five... No. No.
- That's right.
- Till I say. Till I say stop!
- No. 13...
Cheers.
To men.
Do you think I'm gonna be able
to do something with Gigántico?
Ay, Saúl.
I mean, it's like you're-you're
trying to fight like you're...
Hijo del Santo or something.
And that's not you.
I mean, there's a lot of ways
you can fight.
You don't have to be the runt.
You ever thought about being an exótico?
No. No.
No, they don't let exóticos win, you know?
No.
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.
Are you gonna be much longer?
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Tell them to clean the ashtray.
Do you want me to order something?
Some tacos? Yeah.
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.
Do you know them?
No.
I've seen him around.
He's a luchador.
They call him El Comandante.
- Why don't you say hello?
- No, I don't know him.
- I'll introduce you.
- Mom, no.
- Come on. Let's go.
- No.
- Mom, don't!
- Come on, son.
Son!
Excuse me...
You're El Comandante, right?
Yes, that's me.
My son is also a luchador, a famous one.
- What a coincidence.
- Sure.
He fights as El Topo.
I've never seen him fight,
it makes me anxious.
Take it out of my tips, all right?
Yeah?
My mom's, too.
Bye.
Mom. Mom!
Where's yours?
I didn't see you go out.
All right, where's mine?
Look at your father.
You are just like him.
You have his eyes.
His mouth.
You even have the same hair.
What the hell are we doing here?
Let's go home.
He'd still be with us...
if you had listened to me.
The man
in the Silver Mask, the amazing Santo!
The audience welcomes him with such joy.
Mariachis, cheers!
He's the best, right? El Santo.
Here, son.
I got you a little present.
You know who was good
at doing her eyebrows?
Verónica Castro.
- Am I right?
- Few can do it like her.
Yeah.
I loved her hair most.
Sure, the hair!
- Really extraordinary.
- I'm running late.
I don't look like any actress.
It's better that way.
Much better.
You're good to go.
- I like it.
- Look at you!
Rapunzel has nothing on you!
Good?
Don't wait up, son.
Okay.
- Go to bed early.
- Sure.
Can I tell you something?
It's still a work in progress,
okay, so, you know...
That's an exótico.
But he wins.
It's so crowded tonight.
This is it.
Hey, you got this, okay?
Keep your chin up.
Don't worry about them, okay?
All right? And let me handle it, okay?
I'll just take care of it.
Just get your shit together.
You're up next, so get ready.
Yeah, hey, listen,
um, I just want to talk to you.
Things are gonna be
a little different tonight.
Yeah. Yeah.
- Who are you?
- I'm his trainer.
- Lady Anarquía?
- Yeah.
- I'm a huge fan.
- Yeah?
Um, here's the deal.
So, tonight, Gigántico
is gonna fight an exótico,
and that exótico is this guy right here.
But here's the thing.
The exótico's gonna win.
Yeah. Gonna turn the tables.
You got Gigántico to go along with this?
- No. No, it's a surprise.
- Okay.
Then stop wasting my time,
and, you, get dressed as El Topo.
I'm told that
there's been a change in the program.
This is about to get ugly!
Debuting tonight,
a luchador you've never seen before.
Coming to you from El Paso...
Cassandro the Exótico!
Hey, faggot!
Gigántico's gonna crush you!
You're nobody! Fucking faggot!
Fuck you, Cassandro!
How's that?
Cassandro! Cassandro!
No! Saúl!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The winner of this spectacular battle,
The Executioner of Tijuana,
Gigántico!
You better watch it, Topo.
Don't fuck with lucha libre.
We have our traditions, got it?
What?
El Comandante.
You saw me?
Let's talk on Saturday.
Saturday?
So, they're going out of town!
Shh, shh, shh. Two days, yeah.
Two days? Wow, that's a lot.
I got to go.
Okay. But you saw me?
It's better we talk about this
at my place.
You saw me?
Of course I did, honey.
I saw you.
Kill 'em! Kill them all!
Look who's here!
- Welcome!
- Thanks.
- We were waiting for you.
- Thank you.
Follow me.
My name is Lorenzo.
Welcome to my bar.
- Can I buy you a beer?
- Sure, thanks.
Hey, I'm Sabrina, the trainer.
- Feel free to order.
- Shit, there he is.
Commander Gómez Pulido, the police chief.
You know him?
No way. I only know him
from the newspapers.
Come with me.
Okay, I-I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.
- I'll see you in a bit.
How's it going, Lorenzo?
Our rising star.
- Hi, pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.
- Hello.
How are you?
Well, sorry to interrupt.
Let's talk over here. Have a seat.
Thanks.
Holy shit. What a performance!
You had us hypnotized.
- Do you mean it?
- Yeah.
In bullfighting, they say:
"Holy fuck! There's a god
walking among us."
It felt amazing.
People seemed happy.
They were happy all right.
I was about to book Gigántico
for a match in Monterrey,
but now I'm not so sure.
- You're a promoter?
- I wear many hats in this life,
but I want us to be friends.
- Can I be your friend?
- Of course. Friends.
I've never fought
outside of Juárez before.
The way I see it, lucha libre
is the same everywhere.
People are fucked up.
That's why they like it.
The world is fucked up.
For a brief moment,
the luchador offers escape.
From the ring, he tells a story
where good triumphs over evil.
It's the same everywhere.
China, Japan, Monterrey...
The same formula no matter where.
I want to fight everywhere.
- In Japan, China, Monterrey...
- I bet you do.
- Mexico City...
- One thing at a time, kiddo.
We gotta do it here first.
Felipe! Come here.
- Yeah, boss.
- Do you know this guy?
No, I don't think so.
Look again.
Well, this is...
Saúl.
- Cassandro.
- Cassandro the Exótico.
Exótico?
- You're a luchador?
- Yes.
- Cool.
- He's the one to watch.
I want you to show him around,
and make sure he has a good time.
- Sure thing, you got it.
- A fucking good time!
Are you feeling good?
If you need anything, just say the word.
Cool, thanks.
So you guys are in the lucha business?
- Whatever you want.
- Really?
He was talking about a match in Monterrey.
He's a mover and a shaker,
he has a finger in every pie.
Where did you get this?
It's pure vanilla.
Too bad you weren't there
to see Cassandro.
Who?
- Cassandro!
- Yeah.
I'm not really into lucha libre.
I prefer strip clubs,
stuff like that.
That's a shame.
It's too bad, because
it's a beautiful show.
- Real nice.
- Well...
- I like the masks.
- Yeah?
Yeah, they're pretty cool.
What's yours like?
Ain't got one.
Really? No mask?
No mask! None.
- You're different.
- Yeah, always.
- I like that.
- Yeah.
And you're cute.
Thanks.
If Cassandro were here,
he'd tell you many things.
- Mh-
- Yeah, for example...
that he wants to kiss you.
But Cassandro isn't here.
Good, 'cause I have a girlfriend.
Don't want any trouble.
- I have a boyfriend, too.
- Yeah?
Yeah. He's big. Really strong.
Really.
Sorry I came home late.
Did I wake you?
Did I wake you?
No.
The phone did, ringing all morning.
Yesterday was amazing, Mom.
It was a great night,
you should come someday.
It didn't cross your mind.
What's your father going to say
when he hears about this?
He's going to be like a ranch dog
when he finds out.
Saúl!
Son!
It's not just that.
You have to be careful.
Remember what those kids did
to Silvia's son?
Do you like it, Saúl?
Ey, dime.
Are you having fun?
Thank you, baby.
Eduardo, honey.
You should go.
- How's it going?
- Good, good, good.
- How are the girls?
- Good.
- They having fun?
- Yeah. Everyone's good.
I don't want the girls to see her.
I told her to leave.
I saw your mom in the crowd.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Are you ready?
Always.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to this lucha libre night!
Welcome to the fight night!
Facing Blue Flame tonight
in the main event...
Let's welcome Cassandro!
Sabrina, aquí.
Faggot!
Shut up! That's my son.
Faggot! Faggot!
Harder! Harder!
Homo!
Uno, dos...
Kiss! Kiss!
Cassandro wins.
Double the pay for everybody.
Screw you, gringo! Fucking traitor!
I don't lose to exóticos!
- Double?
- Double pay.
Uno, dos, tres.
My idol!
Did you see the crowd roaring?
- Mother of God.
- Praised be the Lord!
Now, picture me in a stadium
or in a real lucha libre arena.
We'll cross that bridge
when we get to it, son.
Are you worried?
You are!
You're worried about my dad.
I know you are.
Go have fun.
- Don't stay up too late.
- I won't.
I could drive you home.
- Nah.
- I'm serious.
I'm not senile.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Please remember what
the medicine man said.
- Drink the infusion.
- Okay, don't make a ruckus.
- I promise I won't.
- Stop it!
Come on, go have fun,
your friends are waiting.
- All right.
- Don't cause a scene.
Same goes for you!
I missed your mouth.
Hey, hold on. Hold on.
One thing at a time.
- Okay. Okay.
- First we eat.
Can make some drinks for us.
Okay.
- Okay.
- We need to celebrate.
Thank you, Universe,
for allowing me to be here,
all alone with Gerardo.
Just me and him.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I think Cassandro's a top.
He and I are so different.
I don't like when you talk about him
like he's a real person.
He's also very daring
and really fun
and sexy.
Don't you think he's sexy?
I mean, yeah, but...
I liked you better when you
were just a regular luchador.
He'll come around. He'll grow up.
I like you the way you are.
Yeah, 'cause you like fucking
little weak topos.
Where's Cassandro now?
I got to get a beer.
Okay.
Let's go, Mom.
- Let's go, scoot over.
- Leave me be.
I'm going to take you somewhere special.
Come on, let's go!
Leave me alone.
I'm telling you,
you're gonna love this place.
All right?
It's really lovely.
See that big house?
I have a huge crush on the guy
who lives there.
I used to do his laundry,
he smelled incredible.
- Is he single?
- Nah.
Married, with two kids.
- I'm doomed.
- No. Not again!
Look.
See that gnarly tree over there?
The woman who lives there is a bed-wetter.
Her bedsheets were always soiled.
- Gross!
- And her husband!
I'm pretty sure he jerked off
at least three times a day
because the towels were always stiff!
They stood up on their own.
Seriously? Damn.
It was gross!
I can't think of any other explanation.
- Look, Mom.
- Sorry for being so crass.
Check it out.
Here we are.
For sale.
But, son... We can't afford this.
Just you wait.
A few fights here and there
in different cities.
I'll get a loan.
We'll figure it out.
Let's go.
Come on, Mom!
I have a surprise for you
in the back, come on.
Come here!
Come on, hurry!
You're going bald.
Don't even say it.
No, don't say it!
When we get this house,
I'll make it a heart-shaped pool.
- Like a heart?
- Yeah.
Why?
Just because. Just to be faggy.
Son.
It's beautiful.
It's got a yellow kitchen.
I want to buy it as soon as possible.
Where's your dad?
No.
It sounds like a story.
No, there's nothing much to tell, no.
Yeah, I don't believe that.
So...
my mom met him at a party when she was...
she was very young.
And, um, and they started
to have an affair, instantly.
That lasted years.
But he had a wife.
And then he had many kids.
Oof.
My mom was so in love with him.
I think she still is.
So you-you knew him?
Yeah.
Yeah, he introduced me to lucha libre.
Took me to a few matches.
You don't... you don't see him no more?
No, not for a while.
I came out when I was 15.
And he's very...
He's a lot into Jesus.
So, one day, he just stopped coming.
Where's yours?
- Who's that, son?
- Just some migrants.
They've crossed over.
Tell them to come inside,
give them some food.
There are chili beans in the fridge.
They're already gone.
They must be hungry.
Thirsty.
They're gone, Mom.
Sometimes they have little kids with them.
Are these empty?
Are you taking them?
Yes, son.
I ran out last night.
Hey, blondie.
Looking to score?
Party in a bag? No?
Yeah, man.
Don't try to lowball me.
You know what's at stake here.
That's too much,
I can't make that work.
Good afternoon, Lorenzo.
What's up?
You know... just wondering
about Monterrey.
I'm a little short on cash...
No, man.
Monterrey fell through.
But check this out.
Palacio de los Deportes
in Mexico City, man!
Son of Santo wants to put on
a big fucking show!
He's looking for a rival
fit for the challenge.
Someone different, worthy of him,
and I thought you could be it.
Against Son of Santo?
The one and only.
You have your work cut out for you.
- I'm not fucking this up.
- Will he step up, or wuss out?
- I think he'll wuss out.
- So, that's how it is?
Good to know, man.
I thought you knew me.
Well done, Lorenzo. Good job.
Now that's a deal.
It's what you always wanted.
And the money.
Yeah, and like 22,000 people, they say.
Yeah.
That way, I can get the house for my mom.
I'm so proud of you.
Why don't you come with me, then?
Come.
No.
Come on. Be my man. Come on.
I'll still be watching you.
From home.
With your kids. And your wife.
On your sofa.
Big like in your home theater.
You don't understand.
- I don't...
- You don't have...
I don't have what? What don't I have?
I don't have a family?
- Fuck you!
- Saúl. No, the back door.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Come in here.
Saúl, get in here. Come on.
Fucking hell.
Everyone should see us! Everyone!
- Shut up! Get in the house.
- Everyone! Your kids!
Fucking idiot. What are you doing?
Shut up!
Come on, stop.
The other wrestlers
think you're getting too big.
What do you mean?
That's a good thing, no?
You're pushing things.
So it's my fault?
Are you saying it's my fault?
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm worried about you.
Things before were...
Everything had a place.
Yeah.
I was there when you wanted to fuck me
and out of the way when you didn't.
I want you to leave her.
You heard me.
Hello.
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
It was her heart, Saúl.
We didn't know what to do.
The burial will be tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.
Today is a good day to die.
Santo, the man in the silver mask!
She's gonna be watching over you
in Mexico City.
Everyone will.
You're gonna be all over TV.
Shit yeah?
Shit yeah.
It's huge.
Cassandro! Welcome, how are you?
- What's your name?
- Sabrina.
Nice to meet you, I'm Ricardo.
Come on.
My uncle is waiting for you.
Of course, Santo always wins,
you know that.
Your goal is to prove you're worthy
of fighting the king.
He's very excited to work with you.
Only the greatest artists
have played here.
He saw you in video or something.
You're gonna like him.
I mean... he's the Son of Santo.
- The legend!
- Exactly.
- A living legend!
- For now, get some rest.
Try not to party too hard
while in Mexico City.
No, of course not.
No, we're focused.
Two tequilas, please.
What's up?
- Oye.
- What is that?
Put it away. Put it away.
For after the fight.
Put it in your pocket.
Okay. Okay. Pocket.
- Okay, okay.
- Pocket.
- I love you. I love you.
- Okay. I love you, too.
- I love you, too. Yeah, yeah.
- Love you very much.
Here.
Saúl?
Hey, do you want some?
Sí. Eso.
You're from the north, right?
How did you know?
You have a thick accent.
Are you from Chihuahua?
I'm from El Paso.
So you're a gringo! Welcome, then.
Thanks.
What brings you here?
I was looking for you.
No, seriously.
Come on, tell me.
The truth is...
I'm a luchador.
I'm fighting Son of Santo tomorrow night.
- Yeah, right... Liar.
- No, I'm serious.
Well then, nice to meet you, I'm Selena.
My pleasure.
I saw that poster on the street, girl.
You're cute, really cute,
but that ain't you.
Lucha.
Lucha libre.
Lucha libre, libre.
Lucha libre.
I'm free.
Sabri?
Sabri.
Sabri!
They sold the house.
The one up the hill with
the heart-shaped swimming pool.
It's gone.
They bought it. Somebody bought it.
It's gone, Sabri.
My mom and I...
We were gonna be dancing.
Living room with a fireplace
and smoking in the kitchen,
the huge yellow kitchen that was there.
Fuck.
Ay.
That-that was
the only reason I wanted to be here.
But it's over.
I'm done.
Last one.
I'm done.
No more.
Saúl.
- No more.
- Don't.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Come on.
- No.
- Come on.
- Sí.
- I love you, girl.
- I love you too.
Twenty-two thousand people
are coming to see you, man.
I told you. We made it!
Yeah.
Do you have someone watching at home?
No.
You know, because...
Well, maybe my dad.
Yeah, maybe him.
I hope so.
Santo! Santo! Santo! Santo!
Yeah! Santo!
Santo! Santo!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to welcome you all
to the Palace of Lucha Libre!
Tonight's main event
features a terrific luchador!
He came all the way from El Paso, Texas.
And also straight from the beauty parlor!
Let's give a warm welcome to...
Cassandro!
Ready, Cassandro? Let me check you.
Gracias.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
let's welcome
the descendant of a legend!
He's the true heir of the Silver Mask!
Let's give a big round of applause to...
The Son of Santo!
Uno, dos...
Uno, dos...
Let me go!
Let him go, motherfucker!
Saúl, let go!
Santo! Santo! Santo!
Fucking exótico faggot.
Faggot! Faggot!
Come on, get him!
He carried me on his shoulders,
and everyone was screaming.
I was talking to Santo's team.
They want to set something up
in New York, or maybe Boston.
I don't remember which cities exactly.
So, just between us, what was he like?
- He's a nice guy.
- Did he take off his mask backstage?
No way, he's the real deal.
They say he never takes it off,
not even when he sleeps.
How much did you make?
A fair amount, yeah.
Get yourself a drink.
Get me another one.
Hey.
We can talk because
they think we're talking about El Santo,
so it's okay.
I think we have to be together.
I need you.
Did he show you his scalp collection?
What?
Santo. The scalps. Did you see them?
Okay, if you want to
keep it a secret, we'll keep it a secret.
It's fine.
It's just that, you know...
you can come to my place now.
That way, she won't know.
I promise I won't tell anyone.
Never. Never.
It's our secret. Ours.
She knows.
She says she's taking the boys
and leaving if it doesn't stop.
Do you think he'll give you a rematch?
Yes. I think so.
That's what he said.
I don't know when, but yes.
What else did he show you?
He showed me the scalps
and the...
the lock of hair he took from Ultraman.
Belts from the time
he fought Blue Demon Jr.
And Huracán Ramírez.
And his trophies.
It was full of trophies.
Like I'd never seen before.
They say he's a real stand-up guy
who treats everyone with respect.
Look at you, Saúl.
Rubbing elbows with royalty.
That's amazing, Saúl. You made it!
Congratulations, man.
Felipe.
- What's up?
- You got some?
Yeah, in the office.
Let's go.
- Are you fucked up?
- You know it.
Damn, Saúl's going to make out
with that little gangster.
I don't care that he bats
for the other team,
but why does he have to
rub it in our face?
I know, man. If he's in the bathroom,
I'm scared to pull my dick out.
- Wouldn't want to catch something.
- Don't flatter yourself.
See you, fellas.
I think I'll call it a night.
- Already?
- Yeah, good night.
Right from my hand, like a bird.
- There it is.
- That's good.
I really can't do this.
It's okay, don't worry.
Don't freak out.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
See you around, stud.
I want us to be friends.
Can I be your friend?
Listen, you can be famous!
You don't know your potential,
but I have a nose for these things.
Trust me.
EXPERIENCES WITH THE SON OF SANTO
Welcome once again
to Experiences with the Son of Santo.
I won this trophy a year ago
at Palacio de los Deportes
against a great luchador
who was unknown back then.
Although I defeated him,
that night, a star was born.
Tonight, he will join us
to look back on this time
and so I can pay my respects
and show my admiration
to a pioneer of the gay community
in the world of lucha libre.
He has changed the image
of exótico wrestlers.
Joining us tonight in
Experiences with the Son of Santo,
my dear old friend, Cassandro the Exótico.
- Welcome, dear friend.
- Thank you so much.
- Do you want to fight, or talk?
- No.
It's better if we talk,
please have a seat.
We will talk as friends.
Cassandro, you know that our audience
wants to learn new things
about our old friends.
Tell us something.
Well...
For me... my greatest source of
inspiration are women.
I was raised by women.
Women have helped me learn
who I want to be,
where I want to go, and where I come from.
I have great admiration for Mother Teresa,
Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Marie Curie
and for Princess Diana.
Lady Anarquía, my friend and trainer.
She's always been there. And...
My mother, of course.
My mother was the one
who made me who I am.
How have you overcome
adversity and strife?
What's your secret?
I just try to be myself.
Just being me.
I think that's how.
What's next for Cassandro?
I have the pleasure to announce
we're launching a world tour.
We're bringing Mexican
wrestling everywhere
because it's the best in the world.
That's right.
We're taking it everywhere.
Cassandro, if you allow me,
I would like to pass the mic
to a young man who has a message for you.
- Of course.
- Shall we?
- Yes, where is he?
- Right here, in front of us.
Cassandro, it's a dream come true
to talk to you in person.
I've seen all your fights
on the Saturday shows,
and I've seen you live
five different times.
I also collect your merch,
including your action figure.
A few... A few months ago...
I came out to my father.
I told him, and he...
he gave me his support.
He's here with me tonight.
I couldn't have done it
if it wasn't for you.
Bravo.
Thank you, Cassandro!
When Sara told me
you called, I didn't believe her.
I thought you never wanted
to see me again.
I thought you were the one
who didn't want to see me again.
People tell me you're really good.
I see your posters around town,
even in my church.
Last week, I see you on a mural.
How was it like
wrestling El Hijo del Santo?
You didn't see it?
I...
I didn't want to watch
what happened to my little boy.
I needed you.
At a certain point in my life,
I-I needed you.
But now I don't.
And it's okay.
Saúl...
Sometimes I think I didn't have a choice
about the person that I ended up being.
Neither did I.
It's my pleasure to introduce...
Cassandro...
- You ready?
- Yeah.
El Exótico.
Yeah.
