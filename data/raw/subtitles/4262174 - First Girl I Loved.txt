Clifton:
Are you kidding me?
 Mijo... mijo...
Clifton:
No, abuela , I have to
go to school.
Manuela:
Clifton:
Manuela:
Clifton:
Shut up.
Manuela:
Clifton:
 Abuela , I was talking
to the phone.
Manuela:
Anne:
Hello!
Clifton:
Yo! What's good?
Oh, damn! What do we have here?
A new bike!
Chromoly frame.
Matte black finish.
Okay, let me see this.
Oh, damn.
Yo, it's smooth.
Shopkeeper:
Clifton:
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I got it. I got it.
Anne? No...
 Putahombre...
What happened?
I think abuelita threw
away all the corkscrews.
She's trying not to
drink so much.
So, should we go buy one?
Oh, fucking pain, man,
all the way to the store?
So I'm just supposed
to sit here
and not drink this bottle
of four-dollar wine?
Well...
Jesus Christ! No! No.
Let's just get a pen.
Let's just get a pen
and push the cork down.
Cliff, do you have a pen?
We can push it down--
no, that's stupid.
It'll just taste all corky.
Doing something stupid?
Rule number one,
don't do stupid things.
Clifton:
So what's the occasion?
Oh, I just wanted to
talk about things.
Yeah?
You know, I've actually heard
quite a few things in my time.
Oh!
What? Oh my god, no! Cliff!
No. The glass, cliff.
What?
It'll get all ground up
in the wine. See?
Hm.
We just need something that's
going to take it off clean.
Oh, shit...
Whoaaa...
Cliff.
What?
One, two, three, ready?
All right, cliff, I am scared.
One...
Two...
Don't do it. Seriously,
don't do it.
Shit. I'm gonna do it.
Okay, cliff, I think this is a
really bad idea--
Clifton:
Cliff:
Um... what's a chromoly frame?
I just explained it to you.
Oh, please, tell me what a
chromoly frame is.
Look, I tried...
I tried to understand, I just...
You just didn't know how
to articulate it to me.
I know you're doing
that thing.
What thing?
The thing where you see how many
times I'll repeat myself.
Oh, fuck, man!
Now speaking of things
what were you going
to tell me?
Just hold on,
you're being way too loud.
Oh, come on.
I thought you had some
great news or some shit.
No.
Okay...
The other night I went to...
I went to cover a game.
Uh huh.
Um... fuck, this is
so weird.
Um...
Sorry,it's just like all of a
sudden my heart's just like,
ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.
Uh... you're my best friend
and I'm really worried that
you're going to think
differently of me.
And I don't know what I would
do without you.
I, um... I like... I like...
I like somebody or whatever.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Damn.
I mean, you're a great friend
and all,
but I kinda got a
girlfriend right now--
don't be dumb.
You're fuckin' dumb.
Please. Seriously, can we be
serious for a second?
Oh, wow, all right.
All right. All right.
All right.
Anne, come here.
Look. Seriously, okay?
What's good?
Do you know Sasha basañez?
Hm, no. Who's he?
Sasha basañez.
Sounds like some dumb-ass
baseball player
or something.
That's actually a
really good guess.
Oh my god, he is? Oh, so good!
Except it's... softball,
not baseball.
Anne:
Mom! I'll be back.
Anne. Where are you going?
Oh wow! What happened
to your head?
Sorry. That came out wrong.
They're pretty.
I have to go do a project.
Where?
Mom, it's right there.
Well, why is this the first time
I'm hearing about a project?
It's this thing. It's on acids
and bases, it's due tomorrow.
Actually, no, no,
it was due today,
but my stupid lab partner didn't
have her thing done.
So it's already going to be a
whole letter-grade off.
Every second that I'm standing
here makes the likelihood
of us finishing on time go down
just... just that much more.
Okay. If you keep your pants on,
I'll drive you. Ten minutes.
No, mom! I have to go to school
'cause I left my bike there
like an idiot.
Can I just go? Mom!
Before it gets dark, please.
Why do I feel like you're
lying to me?
Huh? Why am I getting that
feeling? Uh!
Because the world is out
to get you
and it's a big
fucking conspiracy.
Anne, you know, you sound like a
dummy when you talk like that?
Kids your age use curse words
like a crutch.
Obscenities belie an
inarticulateness
that characterizes your
entire generation...
And if you ask me--
the way you talk is so annoying.
Hm, that's not a very
nice thing to say.
Sat instructor:
All right, we've got five
answers to choose from.
Five answers, where do we start
on a question like this?
Anybody? Anybody. Somebody.
In the middle?
In the middle. Thank you.
Sasha:
Hey, mom!
Rita:
 Hey, honey!
I'm gonna hop in the shower!
Also, my friend's coming over.
 Okay!
Sasha:
 I got it!
Sasha:
 Hi.
Anne:
 Hey! Uh, I'm really
 sorry I'm late.
 I didn't know where
 you lived,
 so I parked somewhere
 else really far away.
 I dunno, I was gonna walk, but
 it's like why walk anywhere,
I have my own car, right?
Right.
Hello.
Oh, this is Anne.
Uh, she's from yearbook.
We're doing a project.
Oh! Are you from
the school yearbook?
Mom, I just said that.
Rita:
 Andi!
 You should ask her how she's
 able to balance school
 and athletics.
'Cause most kids can't do
that...
...but this one can pull it off.
Top 15% of her class!
Oh my god.
Andi!
Andi:
 What! I'm outside!
Did you buy superfoods?
Rita:
Uh, yes,
i bought the superfoods.
Thank you.
Rita:
 Fifteen percent of her class!
Okay, bye!
 Bye!
Your mom's awesome.
Yeah. Uh, come on in.
Sorry, it's like really messy.
Oh, my house is
a lot messier than this.
You're like the first friend
I've had over in like months.
Besides Amanda panda,
Trisha and Lexi,
but they're just like, whatever.
And I guess, "friend,"
I don't know if I would...
You know what I mean.
Uh, yeah.
Um, it's just so busy.
I never get to just like
you know what I mean?
Definitely.
Sorry. You probably think I'm
like, wah! Or something.
Oh, I'm going to get a
superfood, do you want one?
Okay?
It must be, like, really cool,
like, getting to do what you do.
What? What do I do?
You know, get to learn about
people and stuff.
No, I'm sitting in front
of a computer
doing boring layout stuff.
Like, you're the coolest
girl in the school.
Oh my god, no.
I'm so lame.
What? No. One, you're
like the star athlete.
Two, you're really good
at school, right?
I mean, you're in the... you're
in the top 15% of your class.
Yeah.
Uh, so was I supposed to do
anything for this?
I have, like, never been
interviewed before, so.
It's... it's really easy.
Uh, okay.
Question one...
Oh my god, I'm so scared.
Why?
I dont know, what if I say
the wrong thing?
We'll start with an easy one.
A softball, if you will.
Oh, I can definitely talk about
softball.
No, it's not...
Never mind. How old are you?
Eighteen? Yeah. Eighteen.
So you're a senior?
Yep.
Okay....
Do you have a boyfriend?
Um...
Uh...
This is one of the...
The standard questions.
Right. Um... no.
No boyfriend for me.
You just like...
You don't have the time or...?
Ha. I'm getting really nervous.
No. Yeah, of course. Of course.
Um, let's shift gears.
Let's just... shifting gears.
Here's a great one. Okay.
If you could have
dinner with anyone,
living or dead,
with whom would it be?
I don't know. Oh,
Michael Jackson?
Or no. That's stupid.
Um, say I said...
Teddy Roosevelt.
Teddy Roosevelt.
Anne:
...Whenever you can.
I don't know what's
good for you.
Oh, no. It gives me a reason
to get out of practice early.
I'll just tell them we have some
follow-up questions or whatever.
They basically let me
do whatever I want.
Because you're a goody-goody.
No, I'm not.
"No, I'm not."
You're so mean!
I'm sorry. I know.
That's a really bad habit.
No, I... I like when you do it.
I don't know why.
Are you sure you don't want
a ride to your car?
Canoga's like super sketch.
Been workin' out.
Oh. Promise you won't get
raped and get aids and die?
I promise.
Okay. Well... bye.
And good bye to you!
Should we do it like
they do in Europe?
How do they do
it in Europe?
Oh. Wait. Let me try again.
 Oui, oui, oui.
Nice.
Would you like a cigarette?
Would you like a cigarette?
Cigarette!
Okay. Uh, I'm going now.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Girls:
Sasha:
 Hey. I'm bored. Entertain me.
 Anne:
 Do be do, do be do, waaaa!
Sasha:
 I can totally imagine you
 singing that right now.
 Regionals,
 we're going to win for sure.
 It's more state I'm
 worried about.
Anne:
 Is it weird that I'm worried
 about it too?
 I don't even like sports.
Sasha:
 Getting to state is everything
 I've been practicing
 for since forever.
 But now if we lost I
 wouldn't even care.
 Except we wouldn't get to miss
 school.
 Do you think you'll play
 softball in college?
 Do you think you'll
 play football in college?
 Do you think you'll do
 synchronized swimming
 in college?
 Synchronized swimming
 is really hard.
 Don't knock it.
 One time I tried to do
 one of those
 twirly upside-down
 things in a pool
 and inhaled a big gulp of
 water and passed out.
 One time I wasn't supposed
 to go to batting practice
 but I went anyway.
 It was right after I'd already
 messed up my shoulder
and I popped my shoulder out of
 its socket.
 How come you're only now
 taking the sats?
 Did you take the sats
 when you were 12?
Sasha/anne:
 Do you have any brothers or
 sisters?
Sasha/anne:
 Nope. /yep.
 What do you want to be
 when you grow up?
Sasha:
 Sometimes I think I want
 to be a teacher,
 for really little kids.
Anne:
 I want to live in an apartment
 in New York City
and have a job where I take the
 subway to get there
 and have to change lines.
 It doesn't matter what I'm
 doing--
Sasha:
 What if your job is--
Anne:
 I guess it has to be creative.
Sasha:
 You're so creative.
 You're gonna be an artist.
Anne:
 And smoke a ton of cigarettes.
Sasha:
 By the way, that's gross.
Anne:
 I know. I'm trying to quit.
Sasha:
 I have to go play this game,
 one sec.
Umpire:
 Take your base.
Crowd:
Go, Sasha!
Alright, Sasha!
Man in crowd:
Come on, you got this! Three on.
Crowd:
Umpire:
 Ball one!
Umpire:
 Ball two.
Coach:
 Let's go, ladies!
Umpire:
 Ball three!
Coach:
 Sasha!
Clifton:
 Sasha basañez...
Sounds like some dumbass
baseball player or something.
That's actually a
really good guess.
Oh my god, he is?
Oh, so good!
Except it's softball...
Not baseball.
Shit... yo,
you know shit about sports, bro.
Girls play softball,
Anne.
How do you not know this?
I thought you were supposed
to be like some genius
or some shit.
I'm not a genius.
Ah, damn, I know.
I'm sorry.
I hate it when you call me that.
I know. My bad.
That's my bad.
No, Anne, Anne, Anne...
That's my bad, okay?
I'm sorry. Come here. Come here.
All right, so tell me how...
How you got to kick it with this
dude who's on the baseball team.
So you know senior goodbyes?
No, I'm in yearbook and I've
never heard of senior goodbyes.
Okay. Obviously. So Sasha
basañez bought a senior goodbye.
Uh... and you wanted to do him
because he looked good in a pic,
is that why?
I know it's so lame.
I... I took a camera
along to a game
and I acted like I had
to be there
for like "official yearbook"--
oh, no, no, no, no.
What a stalker, bro.
It's not
exactly "stalker".
"Not exactly stalker"?
You hit him with the cam.
No! Okay. It's kind of stalker.
But we were talking
after the game
and I pretended like
i had to do an interview.
Did you guys fuck or...?
No. Jesus.
You know I've never
done that with anybody.
I'm not like you.
Kiss or...?
No, we talked for like
two seconds.
But, seriously, I've never
felt like this before.
Just like...
It's just like what're
we doing here?
Anne, what are we doing here?
Look, you can't tell me about
you and this other guy, okay?
I'm sorry, that's...
That's just the way it is.
Okay. Uh, just...
Here's where it gets kind of--
you know... you know, right?
Know what?
Oh, come on, you're gonna make
me say it? You know!
Okay, uh, just, look,
let me finish my story?
Okay, can you please...
Can you please just not...
Can you not say anything
for a second?
Please, please,
just don't say anything.
You don't really like
this guy, do you?
Um...
Shh. Never mind.
Don't answer that.
Who is that?
Nobody.
Uhm?
 Do you want me to pause it?
Hey!
Hey.
 Are you okay?
No.
 What's wrong?
I don't know.
Sorry I'm bothering you.
 No.
I just totally let everyone
down.
 Oh, no.
Sasha:
I was feeling guilty
 'cause I said I didn't care
 about any of it anymore.
 And then... I shouldn't have
 swung but I swung anyway
 'cause I thought--
it's okay. It's okay.
I'm so sure everything is okay.
 But I swung anyway
 'cause I thought...
I don't know, I wasn't thinking.
- I wasn't playing smart.
- Sorry...
 I'm sure I sound so pathetic
 right now.
Can I tell you something?
 What?
I don't have a car.
What do you mean?
 Remember I said I parked...
...far away. It's 'cause i
walked.
So then why?
I was trying to impress you.
I kind of thought something
was up.
 I know.
I kind of felt like you
knew, too.
 Le cigarette?
 Cigarette?
Oh, oui, le cigarette!
Would you
like a cigarette?
Oh, but of course, I smoke le
 cigarette all the time.
No!
Cool bike.
Go fuck yourself.
Dude, I was trying to
compliment you.
Dude, why do you make it
so hard to be your friend?
You don't want to be my friend.
You want to call me a dyke,
which is so dumb
'cause I'm not even gay.
And I know why you do it and you
know that I know.
So don't even pretend.
Wait. Hold up. Pause. Pause,
pause, pause.
You're not gay anymore?
Hey, look,
i just want to know, okay?
Please get out of my way.
I'm just trying to collect
all the facts here.
Okay, here's a fact:
You're a homophobic asshole.
Anne. Anne, come on.
You really think that?
Listen, this is
obviously hard for you.
So if you need to cry again,
like last time,
this is a safe space. Go ahead.
Hm. Just doesn't have
that kid brother ring, huh?
Jesus. What do you want?
I'm declaring a truce.
Then why'd you steal my bike?
What?
Don't be stupid.
Dude, I really don't know what
you're talking about.
'Cause you're an idiot.
Or a liar, or both.
Jesus! Lady, I didn't steal
your precious dyke.
Anne/clifton:
What'd you say?
Aw, come on.
Mr. maldonado...
I know Julie doesn't work
there any more--
Mr. maldonado, can I talk
to you for a second?
...but I... but I explained to
her our printing situation.
Can I please talk to you
for a second?
I'm so sorry.
Can you give me one second?
Is this about you and cliff?
In a manner of speaking, yes.
But it's... it's less about us
than it is just
about generally not letting
people get away with
that kind of thing.
Mr. maldonado:
Okay, let me stop you.
I don't know what kind of drama
you guys have going on
right now,
but I feel like it's better if
you leave me out of it.
I mean, I'm not trying to be
insensitive, okay, I'm not.
But I just feel like
i would only be
a temporary solution, okay?
Do you feel me?
Cliff!
Yeah?
Stop being annoying.
Hello? You still...?
I'm so sorry. Um, it's really
about the...
Clifton:
You know, if you just
apologize to me we could
end this.
Me apologize to you?
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Uh huh.
Really?
Well, what did he do to her?
Well, I don't think she'd hit
her boyfriend for no reason.
Assistant principal:
 Again, ordinarily we'd let the
 student finish out the day...
...and not involve the parent,
parents, parent in your case.
But there was a violence
element involved
so we did have
to go ahead and ask
that you come collect
Anne for the day.
Sharon:
Of course.
Clifton:
Um, Ms. wiggins?
Yes?
Is it, uh... is it cool if I go
to the nurse now?
Go ahead.
Thankfully no one was
seriously hurt.
Again, uh, that's a good thing.
I just don't like doing this.
I'd rather have the student
finish off the day but,
you know, because there was a
violence element involved
and the official protocol, um,
is to call the parent
when there is a
violence element,
regardless of the level of the
violence element.
Oh my god, just stop saying
"violence element".
Uh, I'm sorry, Anne--
I'm just saying
nothing happened.
You're a chatsworth valley
panther. Don't forget that.
Anne, apologize right now. Anne.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Temperatures are running
high right now
so I do understand that.
Though, again,
the incident itself was a very
serious offence.
So, I think
it's appropriate that
Anne be suspended from school
for the next three days.
Anne:
Wait. What?
Sharon:
 Anne...
Will you tell me what's wrong?
I can tell something's wrong.
Did you guys break
up or something?
No, mom! I told you before that
he's not my boyfriend!
Okay! Then what can I do, honey?
I don't... I mean, you could
start by chilling the fuck out.
Nurse:
 Make sure you bring that back.
Clifton:
Yeah, I will.
Sorry.
Please.
Sasha:
I'm just going to yearbook.
Clifton:
Up this way.
Sharon:
 Why are you talking to
 me like this?
Anne:
 'Cause everything's about you,
 isn't it?
I thought you were in
some big hurry.
Fine. If you won't talk to me,
I'm calling Dr. bowman.
Fine. You know, let's do it.
Let's spend a hundred
dollars an hour
so I can cry to
brilliant Dr. bowman
about my poor putika madre
'cause I'm just so sad!
What does that mean?
What?
What does that mean?
What you just said.
Anne,
I know what madre means,
what does putika mean?
Hm?
It means like...
Means like little bitch, little
whore, it's like--
I'm sorry.
Sasha:
Are you going to yearbook, too?
Clifton:
Yep.
Sasha:
Great.
I guess I'll just keep
following you then.
Hold up, pause, pause, pause.
Uh, we should...
You're Sasha basañez.
Yeah.
You're gonna see Anne.
How did you know that?
Did she say something
about me?
You're really pretty.
Ms. totally checking
herself out--
oh my god, hi! Hey!
How's you? How are you?
How are you, Sasha?
Good. Good. How's you?
Good. I'm good.
Okay.
We should--
yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, hey, I, uh... I have a
humble request of you.
Sasha:
Yeah?
Can I stay at your place?
Um, I just like really don't
want to go home tonight.
Yeah. Sure.
You look awesome.
Yeah? I don't know.
I wish I was like...
Like that, you know.
Instead it's like... buhhh.
What? No. Here, put this on
right now.
Here, put this on.
Put it on, seriously.
Whoa.
Hm. Do I look stupid?
You look amazing.
It's depressing me how
good it looks.
Oh, I don't know.
That weird girl is like wearing
the exact same one.
Who?
Er, no. Don't look
at her. Just...
It's that girl. I don't know.
She's kind of weird.
Oh, guess who asked
me out today?
Who?
Cliff Martinez.
What?
He was just like,
"hey, you're pretty. You want to
go get frozen yogurt?"
I, uh, didn't know that you guys
knew each other.
Hm.
You're not mad, are you?
Or, do you like him?
Hey, I was supposed
to drop this off.
Oh, I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
 Hey, cliff!
What's good, Mr. q?
Come here, let's talk.
Yeah, I just gotta, um,
go live my life.
No, no, no. It's not a debate.
Let's go.
What? Why?
Oh, because I like you.
I want to see you succeed.
Oh, gross! You like "like" me?
Oh, I like you so much.
Here, take a seat.
Ooh, and you're all
touching me and stuff?
This how you talk to
the other kids?
Aw, I don't really talk
to the other kids.
I don't really like them.
Shit...
Um, no. Those go off.
So, uh... tell me,
what'd you do?
What?
Come on. I know this whole
thing's your fault.
I'm gonna let that one
go 'cause I like you.
Come on, man.
Listen, my back is killing me.
I wanna go home,
you wanna go home.
Can we just cut the crap,
you tell me what's going on?
Dude, why do you care so much?
Well, why do you care
about Anne so much?
Dude, why you always gotta be
answering a question with a
question, man?
That's what they teach me in
guidance counselor school.
Yeah?
Come on. Tell me.
Between you and me. Come on.
It's just like,
it's like there's no way
she'll forgive me.
Forgive you for what?
I mean, not "forgive"
'cause I didn't do anything.
Well, have you ever
thought of saying sorry
for this mysterious thing that
you can't tell me about?
Kinda.
"Kinda". So, no.
Dude, whatever you did that
you think you can't come back
from, you probably can.
Never underestimate the human
capacity for forgiveness.
What?
All right.
All right, yo, Mr. q, you gotta
keep this on the low, okay?
You gotta promise.
Okay. Yeah, listen,
whatever you say in this room
stays in this room.
You swear?
I swear.
I need you to swear on your
mother. Honestly.
Honestly, I swear on my mother.
Sit down and tell me
what's going on.
You don't really like
this guy, do you?
Um...
Sh. Never mind.
Don't answer that.
Oh, god...
Cliff...
Oh, god. Yo, take this off.
Take it off. Take it off.
Here.
Oh, fuck...
Okay.
Oh...
Are you on the pill?
What?
Are you on the pill?
Cliff. Cliff...
What? What?
Ah, are you fucking serious
right now...
Oh, shit, you gotta be
kidding me right now...
Fuck...
You okay?
No.
Did it hurt?
You can tell me. I'll listen.
I know the fucking difference
between softball and baseball.
Oh, hey, hey. Yo, yo,
chill, chill, chill.
You need me to say it? Look,
i like you, okay, whatever?
Just... please, just
stop talking.
Why are you being
a dick right now?
I'm being a dick?
You're being a dick.
Please don't call me a dick!
Fuck, okay, chill.
Just don't storm out of here
like some crazy bitch.
Don't call me a bitch!
Fine. Okay. Like a crazy young
lady or whatever...
I don't...
Why are you being so mean to me?
I thought you were supposed to
be... the only person that...
Fuck this!
Whoa, whoa, come on, Anne!
Anne! Come on, what,
you're gonna walk
out of your own house?
Sasha is a girl! Okay?
I don't like you like that.
I just don't!
I don't like you like that!
Sasha basañez is a girl and she
plays softball
and I wanna fuck her!
I don't wanna fuck you!
Are you
kidding me right now?
It's the truth.
What?
Oh... shit.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Cliff...
Cliff, what can I do?
Was that
just to mess me up?
Mess up your friend before you
go off running with some dyke?
Cliff, that is so unfair.
"Cliff, that is so unfair."
What the fuck is the
matter with you?
"What the fuck is the matter
with you, cliff?"
I can't believe that
you're mad at me.
You're the one fucking
leading me on!
I am not leading you on.
Oh, please!
How many times have we been on
the couch together, like,
all... all spooning and
snuggling and shit?
I come over every fucking day.
Dyke. I can't believe all this
fucking time I wasted on you.
Fuck you!
Oh, fuck me? Fuck me?
Yeah, fuck you!
No! No, fuck you! No, fuck you!
Anne:
This is my house!
Get the fuck out!
Fuck!
She... so she didn't
want to have sex,
is that what you're saying?
Cliff, do you feel like maybe
you had sex with Anne
against her will?
I don't know.
Clifton:
 Fuck you!
 Fuck you!
Rita:
 Hey, guys. I'm coming in...
Oh... look at you
two lucky girls.
Sleep-over on a
school night? Yay!
Anne, you called your mom and
she said it was okay, right?
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay...
Well, don't stay up too late.
Good night.
Good night, mom.
All right.
It seems like you've
done this before.
So what's your name?
Maria.
All right.
So are you guys here like every
night or--
oh, every night. Every night.
I live here.
I've got a sleeping bag and i
set it up right over there.
That would be my phone!
I'm giving you my number.
Bop beep, beep boop beep.
Hello?
Oh, it's for you.
Beer's gross, right?
God. Yeah.
Yeah. Here! Pure sugar.
Okay.
Sorry!
Sasha:
Hey. Don't look at them.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't tell anybody.
About what?
I'm really drunk.
No, you're not.
Promise you won't say anything.
Why would I tell anyone?
I don't know. I don't know you.
I don't know,
like, what you're about.
You don't know me?
No.
Hey...
Hey.
Talk to me, please?
Please. Please. Hey. Talk to me.
I'm not like you.
You're so confident.
Me? I'm not. I'm...
I'm really, really not.
I don't know what I'm doing,
either, at all.
Sasha:
Anne... Anne. We gotta go.
Come on.
Yeah.
Bye!
Manuela:
 Clifton!
 Clifton!
Manuela:
Whoa.
Um, I've decided that I'm cool
with us "going out".
Oh yeah, that's, uh...
That's fine with me.
You can tell whoever you want
I'm your boyfriend.
Um, what does that mean?
Look, I know. Okay?
Anne's like my best friend.
Anne? That yearbook girl,
what about her?
You guys aren't a thing?
Sasha!
Girl:
Come on, Sasha.
Hey, Sasha!
Hey! Can we talk for a second?
Hey, you're in yearbook, right?
Is it too late to buy
a senior goodbye?
Yeah, it's too late.
Frick, I knew it.
Can we um... yeah,
can we talk?
Okay.
Maybe alone,
for a second?
Okay.
That was weird.
So? So...
Would you like a
cigarette?
I mean, like what's
going on with us?
I've sent you like a
billion texts.
Um, I don't know,
you wanted to talk to me?
You're talking to me like...
Like you don't know me.
Oh, I know you.
So then say something.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
I... I just like...
You know, I felt like we should
talk. I don't know, obviously.
Well, we're talking.
Here we are.
Um, I'm gonna go.
I, look, I... fuck it.
I like you!
I like-like you.
I was thinking, you know,
it's just like,
why be weird about it?
Let's just keep
hanging out and...
And go out with each other
or whatever.
You and me... please.
Sorry, um...
I'm not gay.
Um, but good luck with that.
Sorry.
Girl:
What was that all about?
I don't know.
Students:
Speech! Speech!
Speech!
Mr. maldonado:
Hey! You guys
remember this, huh?
Students:
Booo!
Haha! Remember that?
Well, say goodbye!
Yeah!
Woo! That felt good, right?
Uh, so, you know,
I want to start thinking about
next year, fundraising,
what kind of themes?
But, for now, you know what?
Let's say goodbye to
the paper copy.
And hit me with the drive,
our finished product!
Look at this space-case. Cliff.
Cliffito! Cliff!
Cliff, hit me with the drive.
I hit... it was a big intro,
"hit me with the drive!"
Oh, my bad.
Here it is, everybody, the
fruits of our labour!
Girl:
What're we gonna do for the
rest of the year?
Boy:
We're not gonna do Jack!
Mr. maldonado:
You wish!
We're gonna do book reports.
Anne:
 Cliff.
Give me the drive.
Why?
Just give it to me.
You gonna do somethin' stupid?
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Hey!
Just wanted to say hello--
excuse me! Hi.
Hi.
I was told to see--
oh, good, you're here.
This way, please.
Rita:
 I understand
but I'm talking about something
 different here.
 I'm talking about a plan--
Mr. q:
 I'd just rather not
 repeat all this.
Sharon:
What's going on?
Assistant principal:
Please have a seat.
Okay, so we're all here.
Uh, so there have been quite a
few accusations and rumours
and accusations flying
around everywhere.
So, um, we did have to, uh,
get everyone together here
before things got out of hand,
and shed some light on the
issues at hand.
This is, again,
a very serious matter
so I did go ahead and bring in
our guidance counsellor,
Mr. quibodeaux.
So I will let him take
it from here.
Right. So Clifton Martinez has
already admitted to putting the
picture in the...
In the yearbook.
And, uh, he... there will be...
He will be disciplined.
Mr. maldonado:
He is definitely off yearbook
next year, that's for damn sure.
Nooo.
Manuela/clifton:
So, uh... so what I'm
hoping we can do
is come to some kind of amicable
agreement between Mrs...
Basañez.
...basañez and cliff and
Sharon...
I'm not... I'm sorry, I don't
know your last name--
first, we need to talk about
solutions.
I'd like to know how we're gonna
fix this,
that's what I would
like to know.
Who can tell me a plan?
Mr. maldonado:
Ma'am, there's no plan per se.
We've already spent thousands of
dollars in printing,
we've sold hundreds
of copies of the yearbook,
there's no possible way--
just tell everybody to bring it
back. How hard can that be?
How hard can that...?
They're kids.
If you tell them to
bring it back
they're going
to hold onto it more.
Josh. If this was something
truly egregious, I get it,
but it's just a silly
little picture.
Rita:
A silly picture?
Excuse me. What picture are we
talking about?
Rita:
What picture? That's perfect.
Anne, you haven't talked
to your mom about this?
Jesus!
Not to intrude but I think
the issue at hand,
apart from the
questionable content,
which is fine, actually,
is whether or not PDA should be
allowed in the yearbook,
regardless of gender or
personal expression.
Clifton:
What about lovebirds?
The whole kissing booth
thing at prom?
Mr. q:
This is a little different--
all these straight
people making out?
That's a little different,
they're groping.
Y'all are just
a bunch of homophobes.
You know what,
who is in charge here?
Who has the most authority?
That would be me, technically.
Okay, ma'am.
If you don't make sure that each
and every one of those books
that you've already sold,
if they're not returned,
then this is going to
become a police matter.
Whoa.
We will certainly look into the
feasibility of that.
But for the time being...
We will refund you the money for
the senior goodbye and we will,
uh, print a corrections page.
You think we care
about the money?
Well, I'm not saying that--
Sasha.
Rita:
Tell them. Tell them
what you told us.
It's okay.
Honey, it's okay.
No one's going to hurt you.
I'm right here.
Tell them.
I didn't want her to kiss me.
What?
Rita:
And what did you tell that girl?
What did you tell her?
Sasha:
I told her to stop.
Anne:
No!
Sasha:
I said stop. Stop. I said it.
No, mom, I...
No, I didn't do that, i--
assistant principal:
Hold on a minute.
Mr. q:
Okay, I'm not sure this is--
okay, I'm not
comfortable with this.
I feel like my daughter is being
accused of something here.
- No, that wasn't--
- Anne, don't say anything.
They were both drinking,
that's why she could take
advantage of her.
All right. One thing at a time.
My daughter is not even gay,
ask her--
excuse me.
Honey, what's your name?
Rita:
Her name is Sasha.
That's how little you know
what's going on in
your own daughter's life
you don't even know
the name of--
Sasha? Sasha? Are you doing this
because you're scared?
Are you afraid right now?
Is that why you're saying
these things--
she's not the one on trial here.
She's not the one on trial.
Listen, no one is on trial.
She's the one who did
something wrong!
And Sasha said stop and
she didn't stop.
Yeah, but did she want
her to stop?
Cliff...
No, this is bullshit!
Shh. Shh. Calm down.
Okay, she keeps saying,
"i told her to stop.
I told her."
Everybody in the whole...
In the whole school
knows that these two
hooked up, okay?
And then she's all...
Like that shit's for real.
You know what I mean,
like that's some real shit.
Mr. q:
I think what cliff is trying to
say, if we can--
yo. Yo, you gotta be real now.
On what happened. You have to.
I was drunk.
Clifton;
Oh, come on.
You know, this is ridiculous.
This should really be
a police matter.
Clifton:
Are you fucking blind?!
She's on the softball team!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Can everybody be quiet!
Thank you.
Now, Sasha... Sasha, it's...
It's very, very important that
you tell the truth.
You understand why?
Mr. q:
Now, did Anne
do something with you
that you didn't want her to do?
I don't know.
Come on.
Ma'am, if you just...
Uh uh.
Mr. q:
Um...
Sharon:
If you have anything else
to say to me,
you should do it in writing.
She's scared. That's why she's
not saying anything.
All of you ganging up on her.
You know, you should really be
ashamed of yourself.
Both of you.
Come on, baby.
Anne?
Anne, I made dinner.
Come on, let's eat.
 I'm not hungry.
Just eat a little.
Eduardo, you going on break?
Yeah, is that cool?
Absolutely. Just have Benny
watch the register, please?
Sasha?
That's me.
Okay, so the test is
super effective.
But I'm also going to ask you
some questions about your
sexual history
and factor that in before we
come to a diagnosis.
So let's just talk about the
last three years.
Number of sexual partners you've
had, that sort of thing.
Um, the first one was
this guy, my friend.
That was my first time.
But he's had sex before, so he's
the one that I'm worried about.
Uh huh.
Um, and the second one...
This is weird.
It's alright.
Just go for it.
I met this guy.
I don't even know his name, it's
just like cool guy from bar.
It was the second time
that I met him.
I don't know, he...
He took me outside
and I don't know why i
agreed to go, but I did.
Oh, god, you must just
think I'm like some stupid slut.
No. I'm not here to judge.
Okay. Um, here goes.
So, basically,
he took out his dick
and he wanted me to give
him a blow job
and I was like, "fuck that."
So he like took my hand and kind
of jerked himself off with it.
And then he splooged all over my
favourite jeans.
I know, I... I'm...
I'm being really paranoid.
It's stupid.
No, I'm glad you brought
this up.
Um, since that happened
have you noticed
any changes in your body?
Like itching or burning?
No.
Okay.
Well, um, your test results
are negative
for the HIV antibody.
So you're good.
That's it?
Yeah, that's it.
I don't have the
twenty-five dollars.
I know the sign says that the
suggested donation--
oh, it's okay.
No, I...
Here, I have...
I have twenty-three--
you can just buy something in
the store if you want to.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna sit here...
For a second.
It's okay.
Sit.
I'm gonna sit here with you.
I don't why I did that,
you know.
I... I went out of my way
to do something
that I didn't want to do at all.
Maybe you were upset
about something?
Yeah.
Okay.
What were you upset about?
This girl.
Okay.
What's her name?
Sasha.
Hah.
Why were you upset about Sasha?
Anne. Anne.
My name's not Sasha.
My name is Anne.
And I'm... totally gay.
