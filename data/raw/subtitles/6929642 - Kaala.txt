Land
In the evolution of
human civilization...
...land has played
an important part
As civilizations developed...
...humans wanted to
produce their own food
They converted forests...
...to agricultural lands
making it conducive for existence
Lands they toiled in
became their God...
...their religious rite and
a caste ritual
Land became power!
From our myths and epics...
to the present
wars fought to expand borders...
and to assert power...
...enslave the losing side
Even in Independent India...
land ownership and deprivation...
and the social status
associated with it...
...are all unwritten laws
Even after many centuries...
...this hasn’t changed much
in our villages and our cities
A considerable amount
of land in the cities...
...is retained by the slum dwellers
through their labour and numbers
We call them the ‘urban poor’
They face severe
oppression in this country
Corporate companies...
and land mafia feel that...
the land of these
under-represented people...
...is ruining the beauty of the city
That they are unclean...
...and are criminal hubs
They want these people to be thrown out
People are removed brutally
from their own land
They are either thrown
outside the city...
...or into match box sized
housing projects
They live and die, with no land
to call their own
This happens in all our cities
with all of us as the eyewitness
India’s financial capital...
...Mumbai is no exception to this
I am reporting from the open laundry
in Dharavi’s 90 feet road
The State assembly elections
are round the corner
Ruling Party Chief Haridev Abhyankar...
...announced 'Pure Mumbai’ scheme
in the last term
A plan to demolish huts
and build apartments instead
Keys to newly built houses
are handed over in many places
'Puja' for the first building in Dharavi
is going on now
‘Arise’, a people’s movement here
is opposing this project
Come along, you will see...
The ‘Bhumi Puja’
is happening on one side...
...and protests by 'Arise' movement
right behind
This first opposition to the scheme
has created a furore among the residents
Hey, what are you doing?
Move
Turn it off!
Stop filming!
Sir, Camera!
(slogan)
We wash clothes every day.
We wash clothes every day!
We work hard every day.
We work hard every day!
Our houses are ours to keep.
Our houses are ours to keep!
'Our land is ours to keep.'
'Our land is ours to keep!'
Start!
'Our jobs are ours to keep.'
'Our jobs are ours to keep!'
Damn!
Hey, Move!
- Our rights are ours to keep!
- Hey, stop
- We will never give it away.
- Stop I said
We are the owners and
we don’t have a problem
What is your problem?
Hey, you are the Secretary
You would have a plan
to mint money out of this
You will leave these people hanging?
Are you the authority here?
Dharavi is going to be
filled with buildings
Saving the ‘dhobi ghat'!
Hey!
This ‘Akka’ has been here for 20 years
What will she do
if there is no place to work?
'Our rights are ours to keep.'
- Brother is here. Come
- Let’s go
'Our jobs are ours to keep.'
I thought there won't be
any problems
- Yes
- Look what is happening
- Don’t worry about it
- Resolve it somehow
He will come here straight
Don't pick a fight with him
I warn you
Why are you all scared?
Huh?
We are just protesting right?
Start!
(slogan)
Our jobs are ours to keep.
Our jobs are ours to keep!
- Move them
- Yes, Sir
- 'Our rights are ours to keep!'
- Go back! Move!
'We will never give it away.'
'We will never give it away!'
We wash clothes every day.
We wash clothes every day!
Our rights are ours to keep.
- 'We will never give it away.'
- Shut up!
You will demand any damn thing
if it comes for free?
What did you give for free?
Is Dharavi your father’s property?
Your father owns this?
Tell me!
Huh?
'Anna', listen
It's unfair to give houses for some
and not for the others
In the name of 'Pure Mumbai'...
...you remove only the slums
Is that enough to make India clean?
Take everyone's consent
before you decide
Hey!
Aren’t you my relative's son?
What work do you have
on 90 feet road?
Hey, this is my Party’s project
Look!
Don’t create a ruckus
Take your people and leave
Ok?
I won’t spare you because
you are my relative
Go back to your work
- Go on, do your work
- Ey!
'Finish this before evening...'
- Sssh sssh!
I won’t be intimidated
by your rowdyism
I am a Marathi girl!
I live right here
Hey, shut up!
You know who you are talking to?
- I know. I can see!
- How dare you?
Get down!
Step down!
Don't you dare raise your voice!
Shut up!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- 'Arrest them!'
I give you 5 minutes
Get out of here. Understand?
Why are you bossing around?
You wag your tail for the
money they throw at you, right?
How dare you...
Devi Akka!
Hey! what the hell
Thrash them
Throw them out
Let go! Let go!
Lock your arms!
'Patil, 'lathi' charge them'
Hold hands
Lock! Lock!
(slogan)
Arrest them! Arrest them!
Arrest them! Arrest them!
Arrest them! Arrest them!
Chase them!
Vishnubhai! How dare you
demolish the dhobi ghat!
Let's see what becomes
of your arrogance in a bit
Stay right here!
I will go get him
Beemji!
Listen to me
Don’t go
Don't go
DON'T...!
EYYY!
Listen!
DON'T GO!
BEEMJI!
Listen Kaala,
2 runs out of the last ball
Hit it slow
I will take over
'Go on, big man!'
Ya right!
He will do it
- Let’s see
- He will!
Just 2 runs!
‘JUJUBI’
Anna, hit a six!
Watch my game now
Hey! Bowl
Bowl I said
Target the stumps
It is our game. Easy! Easy!
All Alert!
Hey, hold on
Now what!
Are you ready?
- Put it now
- Come on, Kaala!
BOWLED!
OU...!
'Hey! Not out'
'What is it Brother-in-law!
'No...Not Out'
Rajappa!
This is a No Ball
What is it Bawa?
No ball, see!
Pa, out!
No ball!
Wide
Wide ball!
Superb Umpire!
Bawa, what say?
'You are the best'
- WIDE
- You and your stupid cricket!
Wide!
'KAALA!
They are demolishing the dhobi ghat'
They beat up my mother
'Lenin and Bharathi are protesting'
'It’s Vishnubhai, Kaala'
Vishnubhai!
Siva!
'We want Justice!'
'Justice! Justice!'
'We want Justice!'
Siva Anna
We have taken up this protest
Don't deviate it
Take them all and leave
Justice! Justice!
We want Justice!
Justice! Justice!
We want Justice!
NO!
Siva Anna!
Siva!
NO!
Hey, what is this?
This is a Law and Order problem
I would have to ‘lathi' charge you
Go on, let's see
Let’s see you lay a finger
Shut up!
Do it
Let's see
Sir, just one second
'Saet'…Sir
Let’s compromise
I have sunk all my
investments in this
If this project doesn’t take off...
...my family will be
stranded on the streets
Please Saet
I will do as you say
Not bad huh?
A horse does eat dry grass
in desperation, huh?
You think we are...
...mediating for commission here?
One tight slap
you will get
They have hidden this
from Kaala’s knowledge
Then something must be wrong
300 families will lose their jobs
Out of them 200 families
will not get houses
Such culprits!
Here comes Vishnubhai!
What?
At the sight of you...
...we will tremble in fear, is it?
Anna!
If you were getting involved
why would I be here?
I thought he was
over-enthusiastic
I am gradually rising in
the ranks of the party
If I close this deal…
…they have promised a seat
in the upcoming MLA election
You have to...help me
Am I not your brother, anyway?
Hey!
When you need something
you call him your brother...
...shower him with love
These people should suffer
for your good reputation?
- That’s your plan, right
- Exactly!
When you become a politician
you lose all your dignity, huh?
Shameless people!
Having a field day
because you have support?
Don’t forget your rank!
Ey!
Shut the hell up!
'Hey Builder!'
Only you can talk
Anna, don’t create problems
Please stop
Kaala Saet!
They are trying to cheat you
We are people who wash clothes
Who will speak for us?
Where would we go, if not here?
'Aren't they doing this
because we have no support'
Anna, she is lying
We consulted everyone
Right?
'Didn't you threaten me?'
Everything is happening with
permissions and procedures, lawfully
HEY!!
Are you talking about the law to us?
We know how to respect the law
And if it oppresses us,
we know to....it too
You are going a bit easy on us...
...only because of some laws that favor us
If not wouldn't you have
thrown us 7 seas away?
Look!
If you want your work done...
...repair everything you've damaged
and change your design
They wash clothes for a living
They will do it right here
What she says, is the law
Got it?
S...Saet!
Get it!
Will we act against Anna’s words!
No sir!
Anna, we have to do
what you say, right!
Builder! Listen to him
I will leave now, Anna
Patil! Let’s go
Hey, Beemji!
- Kaala
'Who was it?'
He is the one
- Him, is it!
- Anna...
Devi...!
Hit him back
Ma, why are you hesitating?
Go beat him up, go
Anna...!
'Go, Akka'
Because she said
all those things...
Don’t listen to them
and do something stupid
'Lenin, let her go'
They can only rally with their flags
'They know nothing else'
You bloody...
Take it
'Superb!'
We know to hold a flag...
...and to hit back
Yes! Fantastic
You raise a finger again
I will thrash you
Hey, who are you messing with!
'Ey! why are you screaming?'
TAKE the hits!
You are the reason for this
You think I am a dud
to be beaten up by a woman?
One stab...
EYYY!
Stop...Stop
Who are you to
raise your hand against him!
Huh?
If Dharavi is a tiny India
with all castes, religions, languages
He is its King
He is its Counsel
If he gives you an order
shut the hell up and do it
Do it!
We are nobodies here
Nothing absolutely
He doesn't realise that
your flag is flying for too long
He doesn't
An out-dated flag
must be lowered, right!
Hey...wait till the elections
We will take care of this
Let's hoist a new flag!
'Searching for your sunglasses?
It has fallen off'
Hari Daada is watching you!
- Move!
- 'Hey, off!'
-'Run!'
- Leave all of you
Bawa!
Let me share your
magnificence on facebook
'Grew up in the waters of 'Tamirabarani'
Untameable, that's why'
Loafing!
When he was young
he went around picking fights, alright!
At this age...why can’t he just
spend time with the grandkids?
Instead…
“Groom from Bombay”
How proud they all were!
I am the one suffering now
Aunty, it is “Mumbai"
Ya right!
Look, you have put
too much salt in this
Add tamarind water
Your Uncle won't like it
As if she is the
only good cook around
Taking on other people's fights!
They have all agreed
to build houses
Why should he go and interfere?
Ma, is this the first time
this is happening?
Come here, I need
to speak to you
Listen, speak to your father directly
As if I don’t know
Hey!
Tell me this
You grew up right here, correct?
This salary and job became possible
from here right?
Now why do you find
Dharavi unacceptable?
Is your wife provoking you?
- Hey, What did I do?
- Why do you involve her?
Let Dharavi end with me
I don’t want it for my kids
Fine. Tell your wife
to stop watching Hindi soaps
Hey, which bone did you break today?
Nothing Ma
Like father, like son
Uncle was also fighting
He will fight, of course!
Let me see how long
Even the daughters-in-law
don’t respect me
See...
I can buy him some meat...
...and make some soup for my husband
What will I give this one?
"VIGITARIAN" he will say
Aunty! It is not "VIGITARIAN"
It’s VEGETARIAN
So?!
I can only say VIGITARIAN
So what?
Hey, why are you hurting my son?
- As if he is a child
- You know it only now!
He has no brains
Don’t you have aplenty?
Give him some
Kids!
Don’t fight when you play
- Soori!
- What is it, Ma?
Why are you letting the money fly?
Where?
Speak money and
he will be all ears
- Rajappa!
- Hold on Bawa
Yes Akka
A friend must give good counsel
Why are you provoking him?
- You are always right
- Maama, sit facing the east
Why now?
Just do what I say
You are the talk of the town
Everyone was like...
“Kaala said this...Kaala did this”
You were the centre of attention
Listen, evil eyes should be warded off
- Akka!
- 'Ok?'
You yell at him non-stop
But still ward off the evil eye
What an art!
- Go on!
- 'Hey! Shut up'
Akka, wait!
- ‘What is it?’
- Look, the revolutionary is here
‘Hello, Nephew!’
Did you wash and dry
the clothes clean?
You are trending on facebook
I know you find this funny
Don’t make me angry
Who will cast an evil eye
on the defeated one?
I am not incapable
I fight for my rights
and will get them
‘We saw what you got’
If your husband hadn’t come
we would have won
Well said, revolutionary!
He would have won, my foot!
You fed off my breasts
Wouldn't I know you?
My husband is a Black Panther!
Without him, they would have
washed clothes on your head
What say?
Please!
Leave me out of this
Tomorrow he will come with Bharathi...
...and protest outside my house
Hey...Ridiculing is it?
- 'Saw that slap?'
- Hey! Stop it
We will show them in action
Let's talk when you do it
Come
- Let me go
- Come
Hey, Mom is just joking
Why get worked up? Sit
Come. Sit
Come sit next to your pair
Don’t have to respect
your in-laws so much
- Just come
- OH
How should I show
my respect, tell me
Should I lower my eyes
like a bride?
Huh?
Kaala!
Your wife talks too much
- 'Me?!'
Not at all!
My wife doesn't
talk more than you
Ey! Chatterbox
Enough
Come sit here
Uh oh! What happened dear?
- He hit me
- What happened?
Who? Sweetie!
- Aadhi!
- Why did you do that?
Grandpa, she hit me first
It was him Grandpa
It is mine. Give it
Don’t fight ok?
Who beat whom?
Nobody did
Nobody he says
No one should fight. Ok?
Akka, include everyone
Alright
Kaala- Our Saviour
No harm should
befall my children
Make everyone happy!
What’s up Kaala?
Warding off the evil eye
and all that
Out in the open, that too
Romance, full swing!
Absoutely
I am romancing my wife
Who will question me?
At this age huh?
Carry on. Have fun
How old do you think we are?
As you age your love increases
- Am I right Maama?
- Exactly
We will do a duet and dance even
Hey! You start singing
The young couple will dance
I was just kidding
Why make it serious!
Let’s dance then

is seen as a major setback

To rejoice in victory

Will be the question

This defeat is equal to death
You have made an easy task...
...difficult
Still!
Rising after a fall is fun
There are many ways to win
I know them all!
'Tender for Dharavi rehabilitation...'
Give it here
Rajappa, look here
They have announced it!
What is it Uncle?
Dharavi is going to be
filled with buildings
The news is out
Perumalsamy
Lot more will happen now
Wait and watch
Dharavi is ours, Brother
Go tell everyone
Dharavi is ours!
(NEWS) 'That was live from headquarters...'
(NEWS) 'You were watching
the press conference live'
'The Govt. has agreed to implement
‘Pure Mumbai’ scheme in Dharavi'
'This scheme was stalled many times
earlier due to opposition'
There is going to be a tough
competition for tender
What are you looking at?
This will be the only news from now
It is getting late
Let's go
Come on!
Is someone going
to pick us up, Ma
It’s actually big
'Zareena Madam’
Ma!
'Namaste' Madam
How are you?
All good?
Fine! Fine!
Welcome!
- Lenin works with us
- So nice to meet you
My darling!
I saw you
when you were small
Live well, my dear
- Bhavani Akka!
- Namaste
Meet Zareena Ma'am
- She has come from abroad
- Are you good?
Here...
The person who has
come here today...
...is Zareena Madam
She has won many international awards
For the urban poor
in African countries...
to lead a dignified life...
...she has built
1000's of buildings
Her coming to Dharavi...
...was made possible
by Perumalsamy Anna
'Perumalsamy, Anna!'
'Super, Anna'
Good times are here, truly
As our first task...
...we have to get a quotation
ready for the tender
We need to mention
our fundamental needs
Attach it with the quotation
If the Govt. likes it...
...they will pass our tender
- Am I right?
- 'Yes, Yes'
Now...
Let's list everything
we need, one by one
When you hurry
to the toilet in the morning...
...is it possible to
squat peacefully?
Non-stop knocking
We should first put an end
to this public toilet nuisance
Right! A toilet in each house
will be good
But, how will you
meet your lovers then?
That is where I met
my husband first
My parents never let me
step out of home
I would meet my husband
when I went to use the toilet
- ‘Go now, too’
- Buzz off
What other things
do you need?
Akka, we need a playground
We need schools
and colleges here
I want a Gym
Hospitals, drinking water,
good roads!
No privacy in the house
for a couple to sit and talk
You stay up like an
owl to hold hands
By the time you kiss…
That’s it
Ya right! You say your
side of the story
Such a tiny space
with adolescent kids
You know how embarrassing it is?
A place to lie down comfortably
at least before I die
That’s all!
- Bro!
Fellow students say that....
...Dharavi is a dump yard, an ugly place
We must change the
name “Dharavi” first
You are right!
Say the name Dharavi...
...and the police
pull you in some case
We have to make
the 'Vinayak' Temple bigger
That is our identity, right?
What about the Mosque?
So many Telugu and Tamil Muslims
helped build it
Let's not forget that
Cross road, 90 feet, Kalyanwadi…
...people should stop living in
neighborhoods divided by caste, Bro
‘Absolutely. Well said'
Ma'am!
Please...a few words Ma'am!
Namaste
I...
I was born and brought
up in Dharavi
My family lived
right here in Beema Chawl
Whose family there?!
We are Muslims from Tamilnadu
When I was in school...
once...
...a riot took place here
That's when...
That's when we left
I have gone around
the whole world
Rio…in Brazil…
- The Olympics venue?!
- Yes!
That city has many big slums
There...
Even when I worked there
The place...
The place I was born...
...must also be like this
was my constant thought
But...
I couldn't come to Dharavi
It has happened today
I have come with a resolution
So...
But...
...I can’t do anything alone
It's our Dharavi
We must develop it together!
When Dharavi was a garbage dump
nobody worried about us
We are now the
centre of the city, right?
Everyone’s eyeing us now
- Rightly said
Govt. is backing them too
We have to be careful
If we stand together
nobody can do anything
-'Salaam'. 'Salaam'
- Sure Bawa. One tight slap!
- Yes Kaala
- We must!
Electricity Board, I tell you!
- Sister, good tea. See you
- Thanks, Anna
Bawa!
A new group has joined hands
with “Arise” Movement, you heard?
For every new building in Dharavi...
...Perumalsamy gets two flats free
Like a bribe
These people are
unaware of it
Why can’t they consult us?
- Haven’t you slept Bhavani?
- Not yet, Anna
Nobody's here, Bawa
Ya!
- Bawa...Bawa...!
- SSSHHH
'What's your name?'
- 'Tell her your name'
- 'Say it, dear'
- 'Come on, say your name'
- 'No, I won't'
'Say it'
BBBAAAH!
♪ My darling!
♪ My dearest!
Bawa, She gave us a shock!
Zareena!
You are the
Madam from Africa, is it!
How are you?
All good?
I am good, Anna
Karikaala!
'Fantastic!'
Only Zareena has the guts
to call you by your name
Even my sister doesn't!
'Am I right Akka?'
W-W-When did you come?
Did you e-e-eat anything?
- Are...you good?
- Why? What happened?
Is your mouth
typing a telegram?
'Calm down! Relax!'
'My Akka is making amends!'
Coffee or tea?
‘COFFEE, COFFEE!’
She drinks...
'Coffee, it seems
You haven’t forgotten?!'
Rajappa!
Akka!
Come in
Get up from here
You too
- Ok Akka
Hey, Akka is creating
a space for my Bawa!
Get in all of you
- Move
- ‘Are you all here?’
Go clean the jeep, go
Akka, give me a coffee too
'Bawa, You carry on'
Hey, Kiddos! Stop peeping
Get in
Bawa is struggling to talk
Staring at him!
(clears throat)
So nice Karikaala
It is so nice to see you
It's been so many years and...
You look...you look well
Wow!
You can talk so much, is it?
It has taken me so many years
to know this
So...
How are you, then?
Are you going to be here from now?
Why?
You want to send me back?
I am going to be here
I am going to work here
I need to meet builders
regarding the tender
I need your help
I will stand by anything
that is good
Lenin works with you, right?
Lenin…
Lenin is very supportive
You have brought him up well
Very active…Bold…
Just like you!

Those days…
'…this land was filled with
sludge and wild grass'
'When our people came here
for jobs, with their kith and kin'
'Veerayyan would
help them make huts'
'He was the centre of everything'
'Huts with 4 logs and a tarpaulin'
'Then half built walls and tin roofs'
'We owe our life here, today...'
'...to your grandpa Veerayyan'
'Every time...'
'...we tried to set up a place
there were so many problems'
'This Hari...'
'...big leader...my foot!'
'He was a nobody
compared to Veerayyan'
'Hari was supported by the ruling party'
They waited till we
took a space, readied it and built houses
Then they would come to...
...chase our people away
Brave Veerayyan!
He would not allow it
'Youngsters from the make-shift dorms
backed him'
'Hands that toiled in farms
Won't they know to take up arms?'
'Hari Daada couldn’t do anything here'
'Veerayyan ruled over Dharavi like that'
Hari couldn’t take it
Suddenly...
...Indira Gandhi declared Emergency
'Hari used the situation
and entered Dharavi with the police'
'To protect themselves
Veerayyan and Kaala...'
'...jumped into
Pathamadai Ayub’s house'
'There was no electricity back then'
It was pitch-black
Zareena came with a chimney lamp
and stood in front of Kaala
Wow! Just wow!
Bawa was swept away
Uncle's heart must have
skipped a beat, right?
Absolutely. Absolutely!
'Akka. Look!'
They had just started
SIWS Junior College
My College...
the water pump
at the coconut tree chawl...
at the toilet near the temple...
...Aurora theatre
I didn't miss out
on a single place
I followed her
like a madman
The news about our love
spread like wildfire
We never expected that...
his relatives and my relatives...
...would accept
our relationship so soon
A life with my favorite person...
...was starting and I was excited about it
Thinking about it
makes me happy still!
But…
In his desperation
to take over Dharavi...
this Hari Daada...
...was trying to finish
off Veerayyan somehow
He used Kaala’s wedding
as an opportunity
They killed anyone
who came their way
Our people didn’t know what to do
Hari Daada slaughtered Veerayyan
in front of Kaala’s eyes
The wedding stage was blazing
That day, that fire...
separated Kaala and Zareena forever
Our dreams went up in flames
To get to know
that Karikaaladu was fine...
...took me so many years
Fearing the riots,
my grandparents...
...took me to Nasik
At that age I couldn’t
decide what to do
A Pastor sent me
to the US to study
Showing riots as a reason
they banished Kaala
Almost like an exile
We didn’t know where
Kaala was so lost
with no information on Zareena
We couldn't find out
about her at all
He started growing the beard
Hasn’t taken it since
'I got married unaware of all this'
Hindi sad songs, all the time
♪ Between you and me ♪
It would go on and on
Will I be quiet?
I would even the score
with an "Ilayaraja" song
‘Zareena!’
He would call in a hurry
Then he will salvage it somehow
I used to curse my fate
Doesn't dad love you?
Go ask Kaala that!
He is a nobody
without this Swarna
'Aunty!'
I think Uncle is smitten by Zareena
Why wouldn’t he!
Doesn’t she look like "Madhuri Dixit"?
'Hey! My Akka is the best'
Come in, Zareena
No. I got some work
Lenin?!
Lenin?
Let me call him
Hey Lenin!
Where is he?
Hey, LENIN!
- Pa?
- Uncle?
- Wh..wh...where is he?
- What happened Uncle?
- WHERE?
- Up there
There!
Where the hell did he disappear?
- Hey! Come soon
- What happened?
- Zareena is waiting
- Who?!
Zareena is waiting!
Quick. Go
'Hello, Madam'
What is happening?
- 'Were you busy?'
'I was getting ready'
What's all this ruckus?
'Looks like it will rain'
'Ya.Ya.'
- Lets leave?
- Yes
- Bye - See you
Let's go Ma'am
- Ya

The first time
I saw your face...
…is still clear in my memory
I was so scared
The way you were
looking at me!
I know
You covered your knees
when I saw you
Threw a dupatta over yourself
You were wearing
a rose colour shirt and...
...a brown colour skirt
It hasn't left my eyes still
Wow!
How well you remember!
Do you like me so much?
Beyond words
Until now
I never thought...
...this would happen
But, this life…
…is so strange
It realises some dreams
And ruins some realities
Sorry!
Listen, how are you
so young still?
Very funny!
I am being serious
Look at me
Old and grayed!
But you?
Thanks
My daughter’s friends
say this too
Hey, I was just joking
You took that seriously
Don’t you feel that
you missed me?
I feel that a lot
That we will
meet again like this...
...never occurred to me
Swarna trusts me so much
I should make sure that
she isn't disheartened, even mildly
Because...
...I am her universe
Just me
Even now...
...she would know
that I am meeting you
But she didn't say a word!
Your life...
...will not be affected
even a bit by me
Don't ever fear that
I know
What is this, Karikaala!
I am not your Zareena
I have changed
Completely
To be that person
in your memories...
...is all I want
I...I...feel
a bit weird
Like, Swarna...
...is right...
next to you
Let’s go Karikaala
Please...
...don’t call me that
Ok!
I will leave now
♪ My darling
♪ My Dearest
♪ What is it...
♪ ...your eyes recite?
Haven’t you slept yet?
Sleeping with my eyes open
Can’t you see?
Hey!
I just went to have
a chat with her
Did you?
My eyes were filled with you
I couldn’t even look at her
Oh! What flattery!
Look! I am going
to my native place
Why?
You think only
you had lovers?
I was in Grade 8
at a Govt. school
Walked all the way
Drum player Perumal
Was behind me like a madman
I liked him as well
But you
brought me here
Listen, book a ticket
I will go
have a chat with him
Just like you
Rules should be the same, right?
Hey!! Swarna...
Swarna...!
She is not the Zareena
I had known
She seems like another person
She feels that
I have changed too
Really?
Why would I lie?
Then say that you love me
Hey!
You won’t say, is it?
Hey... No...No…
I love you my dear
I love you my darling
I feel like crying
But I won’t
Why should I?
No…No…
You shouldn’t cry my darling
I love you
So...
...were you really
in love with Perumal?
It’s raining. Wow!
-Good rains right?
- Ya right!
Bawa!
Same message is being forwarded
for the 9th year now
Idiots. I am receiving
for the 6th time
‘Really?’
We are going to do what
no one else could in Dharavi?
How you made fun always!
Watch what we do now!
- Is it?
- 'On my way Madam'
My dear Nephew!
Is Dharavi getting a golden makeover?
'Come to coconut tree chawl'
‘Arise’ movement
will lead from now on!'
'Nobody can criticize us anymore'
Ya, ya!
'Bring that hero
of your Asura clan too'
- 'OK?'
- Ya!
‘Dharavi: Now
Let’s see how this is going to change'
'First. Houses'
'225 to 350 square feet houses'
'Not for everyone
For those the Govt. qualifies...'
'...In batches'
'Then, Schools...'
'...Hospitals, Pubs, Golf Course'
'Your children will get
free education in these schools'
'Rich kids
will have a separate school'
'Hospital will be the same'
'You can avail free treatment
ONLY during weekends'
- Noticed the golf ground? - Superb
'Where do we get money for this?'
'Let’s sell the buildings
along the main road'
What do you think?
That's not our sector
- 'We don't need freebies'
- 'This side'
- 'Now you think!'
'Isn't this a silent revolution
for quality!'
- Thank you so much
- Thank you!
So kind of you!
Thank you
- Thank you so much, Sir
- Thank you so much
Wow!
It’s so overwhelming
Saw how our new Dharavi
will look?
Huh?
Our Architect sir...
...and our Builder
deserve a round of applause
Dharavi WILL have a new name!
Dharavi will be
truly liberated now
Yay! My friends will visit me now
Superb!
Sir, why do we need a golf course?
Cricket, football and kabadi
are our games, right
Hey! Quit blabbering
Lenin!
What’s wrong in what he said?
Why do we need a golf course?
Hey! It’s ok. It’s ok
Everything has to become
high- class
'Otherwise, how will your friends
respect you?'
- 'Huh?'
- 'Exactly!'
Your happiness...
...is our priority
Zareena Ma’am is here
to do exactly this
This is a victory
for all of us!
Ey!
Applaud for Hari Daada’s victory!
What are you looking at?
Idiots! Go on
Carry on! Louder
You will never understand!
What are you all talking about?
Because Vishnu
can’t do anything directly...
...you have come
in the name of change is it?
He appreciates you
and you praise him
You think we are mad!
Uncle, you have started
your nonsense, is it?
Hey! Why are you threatening him?
Isn’t that the truth!
Don’t you know
who Manu Builder is?
Shiva, why are you
saying this?
Good things are happening in Dharavi
Be happy
You want these people
to live in this muck?
Who came to us
when we were living in muck?
Now...
...because we have made it liveable
They come drooling!
We have Bandra Kurla complex
on one side
And 5 railway stations around
'Commuting from Dharavi
to anywhere in Mumbai is easy'
That's the reason
MLA sir, wait!
Don’t misinterpret this
This is not our motive
'Who is this half-wit?'
Stadiums and golf grounds
it seems
It takes 74 acres
to build a golf ground
Let's say you build it in 50 acres!
Why should we give all that land
and end up in 225 sq.ft houses?
Are we idiots to exchange
a goldmine for chaff?
Ey! Bharathi
Attached toilets in a house
is enough, is it?
Ya! You will raise buildings here
Won’t Kaala’s reputation be dented?
- Hey!
- Ey!
How will he survive then?
He needs a share, Madam
Give him that
He will be quiet
Come let’s go
-'Silence!'
Nonsense!
Stop it
Stop it, I said
So many Govts.
So many builders
But nothing has changed
Nothing has changed
since the time I left
You have concerns, you have problems?
Then give it to me in writing
KARIKAALA!
You create a ruckus and
leave without a word?!
Huh?
Listen, let me come
straight to the issue
This is our land
Land that our ancestors created
Ask the Govt. to help us
We will build our own houses
And keep it clean
I guarantee you that
We all do
What do you all say?
- (people agree)
Govt. will do everything, is it?
What will the Govt. do then?
Don’t say that the Govt. is in debt
Govt. officials and politicians
steal off welfare schemes and live comfortably
Where did that money come from?
'On the point!'
You sell this land now, right now
Just the land will fetch you
400 billion!
You want us to give it all up
and live like losers?
Hey, Rebel leader!
Shut this market and come home
Infuriating…!
Stupid people!
Give me that spanner
'Why are you breaking it?
Ma, don't interfere'
'What?'
Grandpa...Lenin Pa is
breaking something
Let's just do our job, alright?
Ey! Where are you going?
- Listen to me
- Let go off me
I am going to slap you now
Where are you going?
- Ey!
All that you broke now
are what I earned
What your brothers earned
I will break it all
So biased all the time
Say to my face that
I have no rights
Beating around the bush
Chi...why are you crying?
Why did I give you that
Revolutionary's name
I am unable to even yell at you
Did I ask you?
I will change that name
You keep quiet!
Don’t cry my darling
Let’s change that name
We will call you Veerayyan...
Not that name
Keep my dad's name
"Muniayya"
Ma!
I look funny to you too?
Ganging up
Hey, does it look like a movie hall?
Get lost, I warn you
It’s ok dear
What?
We gathered a group
to do some good things
He ruined it all
Only he knows everything
Ya...
We are the pawns for your rebellion?
Why not?
Are you the decision maker here?
Lenin, watch your tongue!
I am quite
because you are my brother
What will you do?
Lay a finger, and you will get no respect
What will you do?
How dare you talk back!
I will slap you tight
- Going on and on
- Wait! Relax!
This is between us!
Hey!
The girl you are in love with, Bharathi
Have you ever gone to her building?
15 people live in those houses, suffocated
Why do we need buildings
if we get only the space of a hut
So?
Show me a place wtihout problems!
He has come to construct apartments...
...not bungalows
They come with money in mind
not people's welfare
How will they build good houses?
Hari Daada that too…
When was the rich
concerned about the poor?
Show me one unselfish person
Let me see?
This is why...
...you shouldn't do anything
We shouldn’t do anything, is it?
And you? Rowdyism is all you know
YES! I am a rowdy
People you bring are good?
With money and power
rowdies become patrons!
No understanding
of the land and it's people
You read 2 books and go around
muttering change and revolution
Understand the basics first!
Yes sir, our heads are filled with clay
Siva Anna
You started it all, right?
Poor Zareena madam
So much blood
Let them rot here
All for them and...
Oh! Wow!
Everyone’s going to cry
that he is not leading their revolution!
Go on! Leave
I will, ofcourse
I have an education and a job
I will take care of myself
Slipper me if I ever
talk on their behalf
Imbeciles...
Muck-brains!
That's why they live in this dirt
Who do you call dirty?!
- Don't
- Maama
Dirt is it
Dei...Dei
Kaala is angry
Cry
Don’t talk to him Pa
'He has gone mad'
'Cry I said'
'Cry, you idiot'
Yes!
We are dirty and poor
You grew up comfortably right
That’s why these 'muck-brains'
appear low to you
According to you...
whether we like it or want it
We must live on the road you lay
Drink the water you pour
And eat the rice you give away
If we refuse, you will say
"Starving dogs..."
"...look at their audacity"
Someone like you has
no place in my house
Get out!
Only if you suffer
you will understand life
Ey! Send him out
- Send him I said
- Maama, wait
Where will he go?
Doesn't he have to think?
He thought we will
stop him from going
If you push him to leave
where will he go?
Poor thing
My sweet heart!
Dei
Go be some place good
Eat at the right time
Take care of your health
My dear one. Ok?
WHA...?
What is this crowd, huh?
My dear Nephew!
Going on a tour?
Huh?
What a swanky bag!
Long trip, is it?
Buy me a souvenir
when you come
Hey, cat on the wall...
I will kill you first
Why are you getting irked?
Get in. All of you
(religious chants)
Oh Lord Ganpathi!
'Moriya!'
Hey, isn't the elevator working?
'Where are you going?'
Hey!
Are we here or further up?
Come!
Where are you going, Akka?
To the Temple, Bharathi
Ok!
Come
Let's go out
Lenin!
Think about it, Lenin
I feel that Kaala is...
...doing the right thing
- Siva
- Ma, shall we move?
- Where is Dad?
- Back there!
Ey! Quick
You know Zareena's house
for sure, right?
I know, Kaala
Come, let’s go
Don’t drop me off
somewhere else
Kaala, I know every
nook and corner here
Why are you scared
like a kid?
Scared is it?!
Move
Why are you getting tensed Kaala?
Hurry up!
- Sit, fast
-Kaala is going alone somewhere!
Brother, Kaala is going via Sion
We got a call
What?
Kaala is going alone
We can finish him off now
- Sure, it’s him?
- Yes
- Confirmed?
- Yes!
He is right here
Quick! Quick
Take left!
This is the house, Kaala
Why are you scared Kaala?
I am here with you right?
Cool
Hey! Buzz off
See, didn’t I tell you?
Leave…!
Carry on! Have fun!
Hi...!
Hi...!
Kaeira, go to the other room
Kaeira, beautiful name!
Kaeira means Black in Greek right?
Yes. It means “Kaala”
Kaeira finish your homework. Go
You both talk
I'll go. Ok?
Errr...
I don’t know what to say!
If you were alright...
...none of this will matter
KARIKAA…
Sorry
I am totally fine
I heard that you were hurt
That’s why I came to see you
Thanks!
Thanks a lot Karikaala!
Sorry, Sorry!
I should call you KAALA
So much concern!
I am ok!
I will leave now
What good has come
to the people who trust you?
What were you doing
all these days?
Could you bring a single builder?
That poor Architect…
So...
What you say
must happen here, is it?
You know nothing beyond rowdyism
I am not the one
to get scared of all this
Don’t spill your words in anger
You don’t realise
who is behind all this
That’s the truth!
That Hari…
…can’t be involved directly
He comes disguised as a builder
behind your NGO
You are just crazy
refusing to see this
Stop it!
Don’t judge me!
Crazy, is it?
Am I crazy?
I know what I am!
Ok?
I was born here too
You treat me like
I support Hari Daada
You want to settle
your enmity with him
And you use people
as lambs to this slaughter
I won’t let it happen
I know how exactly
to implement this scheme
I will do it, Mr. KAALA
Hello…
"Africa- return" Madam
I will always be
selfish about our rights
My people are not lambs
to be slaughtered by anybody
You can't lay a single brick
in the name of Manu Builders!
Listen Kaeira’s mother!
You haven’t seen my
downright rowdyism yet!
You will!
Got it?
Please do!
Karikaala!
Hey! Don’t roam
the streets aimlessly, alright?
I am not doing that Kaala
Concentrate on taking care
of your mother, alright?
Ok!
Hey, why are you going this way?
Let’s- Let's go this way, Kaala
Why are you turning around?
We have to go this way
Kaala, wait…
Why this detour?
Why are you doing this?
- What happened?
- Kaala!
They have rounded us up
Stop the bike
I said stop!
Hey! Go
Kaala!
Step back, I said
What’s up guys?
Setup is it?
I, Veerayyan’s Son,
Am standing all alone
Come on, if you have the guts!
Let’s fight it out
Pa!
I will finish you off first...
...then your father
I will kill you
- Bro! Come let’s go
- Let's move
Beemji!
Come
Couldn't you have told me?
You sent our son
anyway, right
Even if you don’t utter a word
your every breath tells me...
...what runs in your head!
Oh!
Is it?
Tell me what I am thinking now?
I know, Mr. Karikaala!
'KAALA!'
'KAALA!'
What happened?
KAALA!
They killed my son!
My son is hanging dead!
My son is hanging dead there, Kaala
My son is hanging there
'BEEMJI!'
'Look what they have
done to you'
'Who else do I have?'
'Oh! Damn!'
Beema!
'When will I hear you
sing after this?'

Hari Daada has told you
not to surrender
It’s a matter of his prestige
His men will come now
Go with them
Nobody can touch you!

All ok?

Shut up! Is it enough to wear white?
He didn’t even drink water

I wanted to meet the person
messing with my dreams
Just came to take a look
Take a good look then
It was nice meeting you
and your family
Now, let Dharavi be
a memory of your past
Because from now
Dharavi will be mine
Just mine!
Sister, take care of him
Hari Daada!
I didn’t say
you could leave!
You could have
entered Dharavi at will!
But to leave
you need my permission
Let's move!
Take left
Ok! Right!
'Let me see'
Hello, Sir
They have blocked the entrance
We are trying
We are locked up here
What are you doing, huh?
Do something!
Patil, what happened?
Sunil just called…They are…
- Don’t tell me what’s happening there
- We are trying, Sir
Daada, we are trapped
It will be difficult to get out
We must shoot all of them down
Then we can leave
How many bullets do you have?
Hello
'Has the Minister arrived?'
'Ask him to call me'
'Hey!
Look here!'
What happened?
Lost your sense of
East and West in Dharavi?
Kaala’s house is right here
Apologise and go home soon!
Go!
Give him way!
Take permission and leave
Can I leave?
Kaala Saet, can I go?

Sir, this is Zareena
ZAREENA!
She is working towards
getting people's consent
Sir...
Sir, I am very sorry about
what happened in Dharavi
But...
If your company refuses...
...our people will really suffer
Actually sir, there are
only very few people...
...who are misguided in Dharavi
'Because some people oppose
everyone shouldn't suffer, right?'
I have always thought about
people's welfare
'Absolutely'
- What is his name?
- 'Who?'
Kaala
KAALA
Ya, Kaala
To err is human, right?
For one person's mistake...
...why punish another?
Get the consent
for the scheme
I will stand by you
I want to make this country, clean...
...and pure
'Ya. Absolutely'
'Thank you Sir'
We were hoping the same
And don't worry. We will get the consent
as soon as possible
You come all the way from Africa
and do all this
This is my land, my people,
my blood!
Shouldn't I do something too?
What does your husband do?
No...actually...
I am a single mother
I AM A SINGLE MOTHER

Come home tomorrow
If you don't
I will break your leg
Maama, you invite him too
Hey! Come
Ya!
When you come
bring her too
Bharathi...you too
Tomorrow there is a function at home
Come...Alright?
Be there early
(indistinct chatter)
(children chatter)
'Salam walaikum, Brother'
'Walaikum Asalam'
- Has everyone arrived?
They are all inside
(people cheer)
♪ And Kaala is his glorious name
Serve me some more meat...
...more
Bawa!
Come here
Just a minute
'Come Bawa'
Give me a good piece
- Hey Suresh!
- AAAYY!
It's me man!
It's just me
Wow!
Just wow!
Isn't this the ultimate wedding!
Who will believe
that you are 60?
You look just like the Actor NTR
Your youth is returning!
Me?!
Very funny!
The children insisted
I put this on
AKKA!
You don't match
my Brother-in-law's good looks
Accept it!
Hey! Why?
Why are you pulling her into this!
What's happening Maama?
What is he saying?
I am unable to hear
I was telling him that you
look like a gold statue
Well said Maama!
Hey Rajappa!
Heard that?
Of course, Gold Statue
Why get myself into trouble?
Even the Great Haridaada
is scared of your husband
But look how he is
around you
Live long!
Come and eat
Anna, eat some food
for my sake
Where is the meat?
- Here. Here.
- 'Feed him the meat'
Give him lots
Bawa here!
Drink it!
My gift for your wedding
Toddy from a single palm
An offering to our God
Bottoms up!
He will take care of it
Won't you drink for me?
Drink up!
Hey Rajappa!
You are making Kaala drink?!
Hey! Is this foreign liquor?
This is part of our cuisine!
Drink it Bawa!
Drink for my sake
Gulp it!
Like that!
Drink! Drink!
Ok?
Hey! Rajappa
Damn!
What are you giving him?
I didn't give him
He took it from me
You know he doesn't drink
Then why give him that?
- What a wastrel!
-Bawa! Stay steady
I am so angry, that I...
Maama
Maama, are you ok?
Say something Maama
Maama, why are you
looking at me like that?

- Was the food alright?
- Yes!
- Did you eat well?
- Yes! Yes!
- Visit us often. Ok?
- They will
- You leave
- I will walk you out
It's ok Anna
We will take care
Maama! quiet
- Kiddo, bye!
- Ok Uncle
You are high is it?
- Ey!
- Ey, is it?
Then...
Just one bottle of toddy
And you are sooo drunk
All that dancing and singing!
I have been watching
You are going overboard
- Overboard?
- Yes! Careful!
"What you are talking"
English, is it?
Pa, I want to talk to you
Go ahead, Son
You are my universe!
What do you want?
Go on
Kids! Go in and sleep
Why?
Kids are just playing
Why send them?
What do you want to talk?
It is so nice to see
you and mom together
You struggled to bring us up
We live well now
We have no other complaints
But...
Hey! Why are you hesitating?
Actually, Pa
Because you disrespected Hari Daada...
...his men are landing up
in this one's office
He wanted to leave home
I convinced him to
talk after the ceremony
Leaving?
Let us all leave!
We are doing well in our lives
Why compromise?
So many people have left Dharavi
after becoming Doctors and Engineers
Why live in this hell?
Atleast the next generation
can be peaceful, right!
Who lacks peace now?
Are you all scared?
If they both were scared, they wouldn't
have brought us all up so well
Have you forgotten?
Who is he?
Isn't he the one
who killed Veerayyan grandpa
Listen...!
You should never fear
Swarna...
Didn't you tell them stories
of our brave Vijayanagara women?
- What did you teach them?
- Like they will listen!
You have decided to leave, right?
Nobody here will stop you
Leave!
You can't stay a minute more
If you do...
I don't know what I will say
Hey! Stop!
Is this how you
speak to the children?
Hey, listen...
She is just joking
Aunty! Why are you getting angry?
We shouldn't say anything, is it?
It is for all our good, right?
Ey!
Staying united in tough times
is the nice part. Understand?
It is such a small problem
Why are you pushing him around?
One tight slap!
Uncle, just shut up
Such a drunkard!
I am talking to my father
- Mind your business
- EY!!!
How dare you
disrespect elders!
If you leave this place
problems will disappear, is it?
You will change your place,
your language...
...your food
Leave your land and people
to live like a King elsewhere is that life
If you want things to change
do it from here
He left this house too
But did he leave Dharavi?
He and I might have
a million differences
But I don't doubt
the respect he has for this land
I am a tree
who grew right here
Burn me or bury me
But right here!
- Actually...
- 'Ey!'
Another word and..
Get in!
Go!
Get inside
'Go'
'Let's talk in the morning'
Think they can
take me for a ride
Must show them my real self
now and then
Rajappa!
Bring that bottle here
- Huh?
- It is ready
- Right here
- Ey! Shut up
Maama, sit now
Maama!
Listen to me
- Sit, Please
- For your sake
Alright
Idiot!
Hey Patil!
Come! Come!
Sir!
Why are you late, brother?
The celebrations just got over
It's ok
'Rajappa!
Take care of them'
Come Patil!
Is half a bottle ok with you?
Uncle! Calm down
Hey! relax
A whole army is here
It's alright!
'Come! Come!'
'All of you must eat'
- Swarna!
- Huh?
Is there enough food?
Maama!
Keep quiet
What's happening?
What's up?
So many of you are here
There is a warrant for
Vishnu Bhai's murder
Murderer has surrendered right?
- Why are you here?
- Don't create problems now
Come to the Police Station
Come!
Try laying a finger!
Move back!
Move!
Grandpa!
SSSHH!
Relax
Don't worry
Kids will get scared
Let's not create commotion
- Patil
- Sir
You want me to come to the station
Right?
- Yes Sir
- Ok!
Bawa! Hold on!
What is this habit of
arresting at night?
He will come in the morning
Hey, Sivaji!
How are you?
Kids are good?
Make them study well!
Maama!
Maama!
Sir!
Hi!
Hi!
Yes Sir!
Hey, Sivaji
I didn't study
If only I had the chance to study...
WHOA!
We must educate the kids
Sure Sir. Absolutely
- Ok?
My father is there
I need to talk to him
Education
Very Very important
We didn't study
The kids must study well
- It's all your mercy
- EDUCATION
Hey...Kumar!
Who brought you here?
Patil...
- Sir?
Release him!
Huh?
Oh!
Couldn't handle
all the food you ate?
Took a stroll to digest is it?
One tight slap
they will get!
Actually, Minister's
people approached me
They wanted to settle
this by talking
That's why I arranged to
meet without further delay
Let's talk it out Anna
Minister, is it?!
Namaskar
Namaskar
Live long!
You have contacts
at ministerial level?
Crafty guy you are!
Can we fly
the peace flag now?
Yes Anna
Let's do that!
Why sit here for that?
Let's sit in front of my house
and resolve this matter
Swarna will offer us hot coffee
- What do you say, Kumar?
- Actually Anna
- Hey Patil!
- Sir?
Is this why you brought me here?
Couldn't you have told me?
Sir, wait...
Come
Let's go
- Hey, where are you going?
I need to talk
Sit now
Kumar!
Who is this again?
Anna, he is the Minister
Don't you know?
OH!
Minister?!
Namaskar!
Yes. Yes.
Sit
Are you good?
- Ok. Ok
Your wife and children are good?
Which is our Ministry?
Seeing good money?
Money. Bribe?
Anna, why are you doing this?
- Just asking about bribes
- Just sit, I said
Don't you know how to behave!
Hari Daada's words have
a bearing in the Govt
Ok?
Nothing can happen in Dharavi
without your consent, I hear
Is it?
Kumar was talking about it
Is it?
- Yes Anna
Hari Daada is a good, honorable man
He will forgive you
if you apologise
I will arrange for a meeting
Seek apology!
'Kumar!'
Who is this guy?
(man giggles)
Hey, get out
- What is that sound?
- Nothing
Why are you resisting Saet?
Such influential people...
I am doing this for our good
If you do something stupid
You will land us all in trouble
I am quiet only because
we have known each other
I will break your head, open
Step back you idiot
I thought you were a respectable man
I am trying to
resolve this amicably
Only because you have
people's support here
Let me talk to Hari Daada
Let's end this
How many children do you have?
Three, is it?
Four
- FOUR?!
A house for each of them
A house in your name
A place for your factory
All this...
For you
Just don't interfere in this scheme
(whispers)
Kumar...
I won't hurt you
Come close
(whispers)
What Anna?
- Kumar!
- Yes
Who is this idiot?
Why are you doing this Anna?
Are you kidding me?
You won't get out alive
Migrant dog!
You want to rule Mumbai?
Ey!
Get involved again and
I will crush you to death
What fun!
What absolute fun!
Go ahead if you have the gall
One more word and I will...
(indistinct argument)
Welcome!
Welcome!
Hari Daada!
Namaskar!
You are here too, is it?!
Tell me this...
Who is this?
Thug?
Blabbering nonsense
Who sends him for peace talks!
I told you already
No more talks about Dharavi
Bring it up again
You won't sparkle in white anymore
''Meeting over''
Ok?
"Over. Meeting"
You...I have my eyes on you
How dare...
Sivanna...
...they are beating your father
'They are beating up dad'
Apologise!
Do it
Touch Kaala's feet
Buzz off, Idiot
Kaala, this is not your mistake
Who I am
Where I am from...
...you don't seem to understand
People fear me
After all your mistakes...
...I am ready to forgive you
Release Kaala, right away!
Release Kaala, right away!
Release Kaala, right away!
I have a status in this society
Only I know the things I did
to arrive at this status
How many people I killed!
Right here in Dharavi...
...how many riots I engineered!
I am trying to forget it all
But you keep reminding me
When you killed Veerayyan, you didn't expect
his son to be the end of you
Right?
(slogans)
(slogans)
(slogans)
Sir...
Too many people have gathered outside
Media is here as well
Please...
It is not advisable
to do anything now
(glass shatters)
(people revolt)
Everyone gets a chance in life
to rectify their mistakes
I have a good opportunity
to do the same
You murdered Vishnu...
Defeated me in the elections...
Shamed me and...
Daada...!
Daada don't do anything now
Please...please understand
How dare you laugh!
You have no fear
The fearless and the idiot
are divided by a thin line
You won't understand
even if I tell you
Time will tell you
Proof and Justice
will not matter then
I won't do anything now
All those people shouting outside...
will put you on an altar, garland you
worship you and...
...make you into a God
That must not happen
Hey, let him go
Laid a finger on me right!
Ok dude!
OKAY!
Why is he such a fanatic?!
I want him to burn in hell
How dare he hurt you!
I am so angry that...
...I want to hack him to pieces
and go to jail
Hey! Shut up!
You think I would let him hurt me?
Wouldn't I have thrashed them all
That's what I thought too
Can he lay a finger on my Maama?
All that's fine
What is this on your face?
You punched yourself, is it?
A mark of your valour?
Stop laughing
'He will rot to death'
'Idiot!'
Why did you let go of him?
Of course I didn't
I broke his mouth open
I even brought a tooth
to make you believe
Really? Let me see
- Yes
It was right here
Where did it disappear? Where?
Are you looking for this?
-Is it?
- Let go! Stop!
Hey, why are you hiding that now?
It is all going beyond limit
She comes there
stands there and weeps...
...and when I see
she wipes off her tears
I don't know where
all this is going
I will wait to watch
Hey! Stop it
Was she there?
- Huh?
Look at your eyes widening!
If I wasn't there
you would have married her, right?
Tell me frankly
This heart can take it all
I love you darling!
Wow! Ppah!
Your words filled my ears
and went straight to my heart
Swarna!
Swarna
Are you ok?
MAAMA!
PA!
Siva!
Siva...!
Siva!
This house has lost its light!
My Sister, my angel that fed me!
Has left us forever
The guardian of this house is dead!
♪ She was the light of our lives
She has disappeared into the darkness
♪ This place filled with dance and song
Has now lost all its charm
♪ The place you lived
is now a graveyard
♪ Tears have swept
our dreams away
♪ We lost the one
who loved us so much
♪ Darkness has now
engulfed our world
♪ Remembering the love you showered....
My Brother-
all of you must have known
My...
My Mom-
Mom too
Lenin
Before one could understand
what is happening...
...so much happened
If I was also responsible
in some way...
...I will never
forgive myself
This...
This is not just
Lenin and Karikaalan's loss
This is a warning for all of us!
You question them
and they kill you?
That is just fascism!
Pure Mumbai Plan
must not be implemented
Don't get too emotional Madam
You don't get to decide
if this will happen or not
Do only what you came here for
Don't say unnecessary things
What the hell are you talking?
You will lose your respect...
Hey Perumalsamy...
You are the one talking unnecessarily
Go tell Hari Daada!
This project will not happen
This place is ours
Understand?
Get the hell out of here
Anna...get out of here
Hey! Get out
'Praise be to Lord Ram
My brothers and sisters'
'This is the voice of my heart'
'Voice of Mumbai'
'When Mumbai is hurt
even a bit...'
'...the people responsible for it
lose their arm'
'One doesn't know how'
Digital Dharavi...
...and Pure Mumbai!
I salute these Govt. schemes
The dirt that plagues these slums...
The poverty...The darkness...
I want to change it all
'March on Hari Daada
We stand by you!'
Some people want to
defeat this plan
You must root out
these anti-nationals
My victory...
...is your victory
Your victory
Is the Nation's victory!
'Long live Maharashtra'
'What happened?'
'There is no water'
It has been two days now
Bawa, he has begun his game!
One tight slap!
Sir, why are you locking it?
Why are you locking?
Hello, what are you doing?
Wait! Wait!
What Govt. order do you have?
There is a limit for everything
One tight slap!
We...
...must do something
Stop crying
I will get you crayons, ok?
Thank You
What are you doing, Grandpa?
A weapon shouldn't get rusty
It must remain sharp always
This belongs to our ancestors
Kaala is here!
Let him in
Come Kaala
Come!
Come
Come in
Sit
I wanted to kill you, actually
Things went wrong
The mistake wasn't mine, but God's!
Your wife and son...
I am sorry
Please, forgive me
Sit
Sit down!
(clock chimes)
Mangal dear!
Get some water
'Yes grandpa'
- 'Careful
- Yes! Yes!'
Hey...
Take Grandpa's blessing
Should I tell you all this?
No dear!
Namaste is enough
Namaste!
Sweet girl!
(whispers)
Grandpa!
He seems to be a very nice person
Don't kill him
Go!
She says...
...you are a very nice person
"Don't kill him!"
Why will I kill you
if you don't get in my way
You can't kill me
Because...
I am KAALA
God of Death
King "Yama"!
Let's see
Who the God of Death is!
KAALA...
What sort of a name is this man?
It disgusts me when I say it
This black colour...
...is ugly to look at
Irritates my eyes
White is pure
Black is dirty
Irritates you, is it?
What an ugly thought
The problem is in your perception
Black...
...is the colour of the Proletarait
Come see in my chawls
Dust scatters into a rainbow
Hygiene, clean and pure
These are your masks!
What do you actually want?
Land?
It was in someone's name yesterday
and will change hands tomorrow
When you die the six feet
will not be yours permanently
Why are you so maniacal?
Hey, tell me something new
I know very well that
everything will be right here
I can't take anything
up there with me
Six feet land is all I get
Nothing is permanent
Lord Krishna has spoken in my ear
I am not unaware of all this
Even then, that land...
for two days even...
...should be in my name
and I will be happy
Do you have any problem?
Yes I do!
To you, land is power
To us it means life
Get it?
And power is my life
Power is what I live for!
If I throw stones
at every dog on the road
I will never reach my destination
I am using my power
for good things
If it looks wrong to you,
it's your problem
Anybody who opposes me...
...will die
"Arjuna" stood confused in the war-front
What the Lord did that day...
...is what this Hari is doing today
If stealing my land is your dharma
and your God's dharma...
...I won't even spare your God!
I made a small mistake
Your wife and son
died because of me
I feel guilty about it
That's why I let you into my house
What right do you have
to sit in front of me?
You must know who you are!
I don't like to remind you constantly
Throw your pride aside
Come apologise to me!
Just two feet
Put an end to this
Come
The distance is the same
Touch my feet
I will decide if I want to
punish or forgive you
Hold on!
Hold on!
I didn't come here to fight
You mustn't think
that my loss has shattered me
You might have power
I have thousands of people
as my support, family and companions
You can't do anything in Dharavi
I came here to say exactly that, all alone!
Hear me out Hari...
My ancestors wish!
Kaala's promise
I won't spare you
Stab me in the back, if you will
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Thanks for not killing him
Nice person!
'How dare you!'
Go! Get in!
Did you tell everyone
to come fetch water?
One by one
Patience!
Patience!
Perumalsamy, what are you doing?
What is this nonsense?
Why are you doing this?
We don't need this
Who permitted you to issues tokens?
'Who are you to evict us?'
'We won't leave this place!
Get out of here'
Ey! Who cut the electricity?
Huh?
If you shut the electricity
we will get scared, is it?
My body is a power hub!
Hey you all
Come stand in queue!
Take as much electricity
from my body
I can supply power
to the whole of Dharavi!
Grandpa, isn't your name Karikaaladu?
That's right...
Why Grandpa?
Why don't you have a modern name?
Such an old name Grandpa!
Sweetie, it is a classic Telugu name
Oh!!!
Grandpa, why do they call you Kaala?
He is dark skinned right
That's why he is called that!
Hey! That also...
Remember our village festival every year?
Grandpa has been given
that God's name
KAALA...
...according to our people
is our saviour
Grandpa, are you a gangster?
No he is a rowdieeee!
Earlier, when you questioned a bad guy
you were called a rowdy!
Now it has all changed
When someone is unjust to you
and you hit back...
...they brand you as rowdies
My father questioned oppression
They killed him
I had a mad determination
to avenge his death
The blind rage was taking me nowhere
Swarna 'ma made me realise this
You are scared of Swarna 'ma right?
SOOO scared
She is my angel, sweetheart
My guardian angel!
The people who killed
our Uncle and Grandma...
...will kill us too
My friends were talking about it
But I said...
"We are Kaala's grandchildren
Nobody can harm us"
Shut up! Don't talk
more than you should
Why are you chiding them?
They are just...
Listen to me, my darlings
You have to be compassionate, always
Let all this fighting end with me
That...
That's why I lost my Swarna...
...my captain Siva
Damn that drink!
If I wasn't drunk that day...
...I wouldn't have
lost them both
If you keep mourning the dead
who will think of the living?
Aims and ambitions!
Siva didn't know any of that
"I will die for my father"
he would say
'That is all he knew'
It is painful, yes!
But we should lose nothing anymore
Be brave!
We will stand by you
That's right
We mustn't lose anything
We will support you
All of us
Uncle, please get up
Kids haven't eaten too
Come let's have dinner
(glass breaks)
Hey, who's that?
Nothing. Don't worry
They have set fire to our house!
Get out fast!
Kaala, my books are burnt
How will I go to school now?
Bawa!
Bawa!
Come take a look
Come
My wife's photo...
Bawa!
This is all I had left
This is gone too
Gone!
'PA'
Pa...
15 earthmovers...
200 policeforce...
...mercenaries in addition
They want to evict us all today
by burning or demolishing
Mani Saet is issuing eviction tokens
Zareena and Bharathi are fighting
Let's go!
There is no need!
You are the reason for all this
These houses are burning because of you
You burnt these houses down!
This is your responsibility
You are fooling all these people
Don't you dare raise a finger!
You are an Inspector
You haven't filed the FIR
'Why are you here?'
Listen, good thing
we didn't lose more
I am saying this as your MLA
Hari Daada is involving
the state machinery
'Don't do anything unnecessarily'
Kaala!
Stop it, Patil!
Shoot!
MOVE!
Shoot, let's see
Shoot me if you can!
Shoot me!
Shoot me first!
Do you have the guts to shoot?
Will you get out alive, if you do?
Shoot me, shoot!
(slogan) GET OUT OF HERE
GET OUT OF HERE
Hey...khaki uniform!
What audacity to point a gun here!
You are possessed by power
Run away before we exorcise you
I will return!
I will!
We are worried about
what will happen now
He has burnt the houses today
It will be us tomorrow
He won't
As long as we have
the strength to slog...
...he would want us to obey him
...and slave for him
He wants us
as his slaves!
He is threatening us
We must get scared
That is his intention
How long should we live in this fear?
We should just die, instead
Why should we die?
Our lives are beyond death!
We MUST live!
So...should we sign
the bond of slavery?
We are slaves to nobody
We created this city
We created Dharavi
We have a right over this
This city doesn't exist without us
We must make him understand this
We should stop working for him
(slogan) Yes we will!
Our body is our only weapon
The whole world
must know about this
Organise everyone!
Hey! Where are you?
Come to Dharavi. NOW!
Kaala has called for a strike
Let's leave, come on
They are asking everyone to come back
Strike is it?
Kaala has announced?
Come! Come!
Let's go!
Tell me, dear
- Kaala is calling you
It's a strike, Pa
Bro! Can you get down please?
I can't take you
Why?
- Strike
This is a protest
to prove ourselves
Where are you?
Are you here?
Wait! Who are you?
- Press, Sir
We are seeking rights
Not alms
One demand!
Let's say it loud and proud!
This land will belong to us
Let's say it loud!
Land is our birthright!
Land is our birthright!
Land is our birthright!
Land is our birthright!
Rajappa
- Bawa!
You are the first reporter here

I am Sivaji Rao Gaikwad
I grew up in a slum like this
I was born and brought up
in Bheem Nagar
It is not there today
They say
the Country has to develop...
...and hence you must sacrifice
Why?
The same sacrifice...
can be made by a rich man...
...or a politician, right?
I stand by you
in this fight for your right
Jai Bhim!
Praise be to Ambedkar!
You can't speak against the State
Don't you know?
This is for the people!
♪ The sky is not what we need
Neither those stars!
The same venue
had a protest earlier
People who opposed the struggle
are now supporting Dharavi

There is nothing to fear!
(NEWS) They are not worried about
the Rule of Law
(NEWS) Public TV has visuals of anti-social
elements blocking highways in the city
(NEWS) In a city that has
100s of acres of private landholding...
...can't the urban poor
have some land of their own?
My driver didn't turn up today
I took the local train
I have never taken a local train in
my life. What's this?
The lazy people of Dharavi
have made me lose 20 lakhs per day
Twenty lakhs loss!
Can you believe?

A good news for all of us!
We are going to win this struggle!
This is our victory
Government is considering our demands
This is OUR victory!
Your father runs this state!
Will you do as you please?
Who do you think I am?
I dreamt this
with my eyes wide open
If I show you my real self
you won't handle it
What right does Kaala
have over Mumbai?
Bombay was ours!
Bambai was ours!
Mumbai will stay ours!
People who closed
their noses in disgust
Will now look at Dharavi
with pride...
...after this project
And your Government
is hindering it?
Go tell them
The sun will rise tomorrow
only upon my word!
A night is all I need
I am born to rule!
YA ALLAH!
SILENCE
Stop!
Stop!
I will butcher you
for what you did in our Mosque!
Hey!
We treated you as equals...
...and you show your ugly side?
That's why we stayed away from you
'What is there to talk?
Hack him now'
Here...hold this...
Take it
Hack him!
Kill each other!
Go on!
Saw that!
Not one of my people
came forward!
Murali and Rahim
are kins here
Ganesh and Abdul are brethren
We live united here
Nothing you do
can separate us
Hari Daada's henchmen!
CHASE THEM AWAY
Ready!
'Look, the culprits are here'
- 'Move. Move'
- What's up Patil?
Your head is reeling in helplessness?
You thought you could
count the teeth of a tiger?
What you want
will never happen
Get out you...!
How dare you!
You police ...!
'PUPPY!'
Fire!
Let go off me
Take your clothes!
(announcement on PA)
Attention! People of Dharavi
'Section 144 is applicable
with immediate effect'
"Refreshing Rama's memories..."
"...Matali said as follows"
"O valiant one!
Why fight this battle..."
"...when you know ways
to kill Ravana"
Translation
Matali asked Lord Ram...
Daada!
Look at all these offerings to God!
There is only one thing missing
Go bring his head!
"The time has come
to destroy the demon kingdom"
"The time has come
to destroy the demon kingdom"
Nobody should come in
- Nobody will
(announcement on PA)
Agitators will be arrested!
"Both sides had only one agenda
To take each other's lives"
Hey, go that side
You come with me
(announcement on PA)
'Attention People of Dharavi'
Don't...Don't come out
Shut the door!
'Section 144 is applicable
with immediate effect'
Go look!
I saw 2 men near VOC tower
They are looking for us!
We have to be careful
We will!
Hari Daada's men are everywhere
Where?
- Round the corner
At the junction?
- What is happening?
- Nothing Pa. Just talking
Go look in the chawls
Look there
"The war between them
was escalating rapidly"
Hey! Who the hell are you?
Don't follow the language?
None of you should be here
Run away!
GO!
What are you glaring at?
One tight slap and...
Come on!
"The first time Rama...
...chopped off the head
of Ravana with his arrow"
"Just when that head
touched the ground..."
"...another head cropped up
on the shoulders of Ravana"
"The second head of Ravana
was cut off"
"Soon after that, another
rose into view again"
"Ram kept chopping the heads"
"But heads kept cropping up"
'Kill him, now!'
"A hundred of Ravana's heads
were chopped off at the war front"
'What's happening?'
'Karikaala!'
You are their target
One night!
Just this night!
We will win
Let's wait!
So what if I die?
Aren't you all there!
Each one of you here is Kaala!
KARIKAALA!
Wait!
Don't be scared
"As Lord Ram lifted his weapon..."
"...entire forests and
the humankind"
"...and all creations trembled
in fear"
It's ok!
"Let’s chant together
Praise be to Lord Ram"
Karikaala!
Go on!
Go. Quick
Kaala!
KARIKAALA!
"Let’s chant together
Praise be to Lord Ram"
"HAIL"
Kill him
"The weapon pierced Ravana’s body
and fell to the ground"
"Praise be to Lord Ram!"
Hail!
Born to rule!
Born to rule!
"The arrow that pierced
through Ravana’s heart"
"That glorious arrow"
"Got out of his body"
"Carried Ravana’s sinful soul"
"And disappeared in earth’s core"
During the curfew-riots
in Dharavi
Our reporter Praveen...
...collected footage risking his life
They reveal that
the police led the riot...
...and damaged public property
At the end of a
departmental enquiry...
...Dharavi Inspector Pankaj Patil
has been arrested
Kaala (aka) Karikaaladu
who led the Dharavi strike...
...died in a fire accident
reports the Police
'But when we asked the
People of Dharavi about the same...'
Idiot! What nonsense are you saying?
Kaala was sitting
near the Buddha temple
Get lost!
Karikaaladu will never die
Buzz off!
Jesus was crucified!
Didn't he rise from death?
There isn't anybody
who can kill Kaala!
This is Kaala's fort!
One tight slap!
The question of Kaala's death
doesn't rise in their minds
'After all this
with the support of the Govt....'
'and using his power...'
'Haridev Abhyankar...'
'...is hell-bent on implementing
Pure Mumbai scheme in Dharavi'
He is coming here
for the bhumi puja of this project
This has created doubts and uncertainty
among the people here
'This is Black Fort'

fistful of sand from here'

reclaimed their land and history
This struggle has inspired people
in slums all over the country
The urban poor of this country...
...have organised under
the slogan "Land is our right"
It has become
a People's Movement
(slogans)
Our land is ours!
Our land is our right.
Our land is our right!
Our land is ours.
Our land is ours!
Our land is our right.
Our land is our right!
Our land is ours.
