oh, Pike
Mrs. Cornwell ...
Good afternoon.
Now Pike, how many times are you
gonna make me ask you to call me Grace?
Good morning Pike.
I’m not going to take
up much of your time
This? Henry Hart,
Sam Hart's grandson.
But you must remember Henry
you went to school together
Anyway ...
Henry’s setting up
things at home for Sam.
and we need somebody
to cook dinner for them.
oh... I don't umm
I can't cook
you know, Henry's
been living in New York,
but we're not going
to hold that against him
I thought you might be
able to arrange something
that ought to be easy enough
Madeleine over at little's lambs
ought to be able to fry up something
Jim, you know Sam's in the
hospital because of his heart
right. sorry
what about the widow Thayer.
I remember her.
I do not know.
I can't have her over
there pestering these two
was going to ask you
to do me a favor, Pike.
you have to run the middle
you go and pick up the
dinners from the widow Thayers
and then you deliver
them to Sam and Henry.
alright?
I... I don't think I could..
I live right by the widow Thayers
I'll be glad to go
by... pick 'em up
I want Pike to do this for me
Relax, you'll do fine
now, I gotta get back to school
Excuse me Jim.
you got him honey?
I got him
alright
that’s good
Be humble is one thing,
let me tell ya, its another
thing all together to be shamed.
there's no shame in it Sam
now be still
isn't that what you're all
afraid of, me being still?
you have no idea how
little I'm afraid of Sam
I can walk.
no, no, no, no
oh, you can fly
right off the the Klingbeil's
roof in a single bound
got a mind to put
me in the lake...
What does it mean and how
long will you stay?
well, that depends
but if he's alright
he's in a wheelchair
Mary Margaret.
yeah? so am I
what are you talking about?
Good evening Mr. Dexter.
come on in
Good evening Mr. Hart.
Mary Margaret
that's totally ridiculous
Here a...
beans and ah...
biscuits
gravy's out in the truck
hey?
oh, I’ll go get it... hold on
now that's a dinner!
just how many strokes
was it you wanted to have?
you can't eat that
die if I don't
you'll die if you do
well, it will be your fault
hold on we're going to have
to be much more specific
oh, I thought you
were talking to me.
what does that say?
no salt
well, guess there's not
much point then is there?
- I stopped the caterer
- okay, you'll be back when?
like I said
that depends on ...
well ...
Dean's back.
How many years of
therapy to get over this
guy... This captain of the football
team, lumber jack team fantasy
he was never captain
of the football team.
oh, okay, I'm corrected.
just until he's back on his feet
so to speak
maybe this means you can
finally tell Sam that your gay
put some of that therapy to use
he knows you know
I don’t have to tell you that
you don’t imagine
he hasn't figured out?
it might be a
reasonable explanation
for the fact that the last
time you had a girlfriend
- you were [Pike - gravy]
also in the 3rd grade
look, I gotta go
I'll call you later.
do not hang don’t hang... don’t
he hung up on me
come on Mr Dexter
grab a plate.
Thank you but ah...
but I have my
own supper at home
You sure?
it's just gonna go to waste
thank you again.
It was a...
nice to see you Mr hart

Life is good
Man ... you really
gotta loosen up some
what'cha doin
Did you see that?
thank you
brother's and sister's
we gather this morning
in the house of our lord
We come in fellowship
to bear witness and to
celebrate god's
single message of love
Let us now look forward
Andrew, Andrew!
shhh
let us not look through this than this house -
[Andrew]hey that's the guy from the north pole
- or ourselves for evidence of this message
- the guy Sam sits in
let us look upon ourselves
and reflect on how we may
increase our commitment
to being servants
of this message.
how we, by deed and thought
can further open our
hearts and our arms.
so we may use our
hands and our mouths.
as instruments of articulation
in spreading this message
if we are to believe
that god is everywhere
then we must believe
this of ourselves as well
and understand
there are no limits
or borders or constraints
on our ability
to spread His love.
Everything we do ...
Henry!
Henry!
Henry!
Man
I can not believe you are here!
ah
Man, it's good to see you.
Mr. Hart, I want to thank

The beans alright?
Beans, I...
Yes. they seemed a little plain

if I'm told not to salt them
they just don't taste
right to me however.

you were in high school.
Now Henry, you know my
wife Didi, you remember her?

Though he wasn't
quite as handsome.
We've been hearing
a lot about you Henry
Oh, there's my boy!
Mrs Thayer
Well, it's nice to
see you again, too.
Now eat up good!
Okay
- Good to see you again.
- Hi Douglas
Where's Pike?
Pike?
Oh Pike don't go in much
for crowds you know?
Well he donates this
barbecue every year but...
I don't expect
he'll be coming
I imagine he's on his way over
to your place with that supper.
Oh shoot, you know, I guess I
should have told him
it was just going to be
Sam for dinner tonight.
You know, I couldn't get Sam
to come here with me, either.
Now, don't worry about all that.
Now look, we got your burgers rare,
we got 'em well done,
we got em with cheese,
we got em with
a little bit of chili...
what's your pleasure?
Forget all that Henry.
we got ribs, the best ribs...
and we'll give you
some extra sauce.
- Jenny'll see to it.
- You know I will.
It's very tempting.
A great country band
playing fine music,
Gonna have a clear
night... crazy dancing.
What more could you ask for?
I don't...
- Andrew Stewart, hello.

Ben said don't forget corn,
we gotta get corn on the cob
Okay, there's corn right....
The corn's right over here....
Stay girl

Evening Mr. Hart.
I'm afraid you caught me
down by one tonight
The boy's gone
out for the evening
Gone to town for the picnic
Well it's ah...
nice night for it.
I expect you'll be
joining the festivities.
Oh, I... I can do that. I
don't want to hold you up
It's no trouble
Would you like some water?
There you go.
- Do you mind?
- Oh no.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Hart.
That's right
I still am.
It would be an honor to have
you share this meal with me, Pike
These can wait
Come on
- Where is your brother?
- Oh, over there somewhere
Didi, don't neglect
your husband!
You will dance with him.
I've got my guy
Oh look at them go
Go boys!
Try to keep up there, Mayor.

It was great seeing everyone.
Wait, wait, wait, wait

Ten years you don't talk.
And now he just shows up and
starts putting the moves on you?
Yes, that's right.
And they had fireworks.
Making all of your high school
dreams come true, is he?
Did he ask you to marry him?
It wasn't like that
Oh my god! Secret, secret.
No, I mean it Stacy,
he likes you, likes you.
Henry, this is going to be
hard to hear, but Dean's straight
- I know but ...
- No!
No it. Straight,
Henry. Dean's straight.
Straight as an arrow,
Straight, straight like a ruler,
Son ...
straight, straight like...
what else is straight?
Oh! I gotta go.
I'll call you later
Oh, the baby's fine,
thanks for asking
I'm sorry!
Son?
Sampa?
Is there something
you want to tell me?
Not that I know of
Thank you so much
Henry, just do me a favor
and stop thanking me, alright?
Grace ...
What am I going to do?
This space is going to be
here all summer unused.
It's too much of a waste
And I have an artist who needs a studio.
Grace... Just...
Oh goodness
Come in
I gotta go
Go ahead, go ahead...
So we're both...
Hey Pike.
Henry...
I wanted to ask after Sam?
I missed his voice this morning.
Oh, he's fine,
just a little tired.
I'll let him know
you asked after him.
No, no, no. Don't do that
Nothing makes you feel worse
than people asking about your health.
Let's spare him that.
You know you out did
yourself again last night.
That was an incredible sorbet
Sorbet?
I don't know where you
found peaches this time of year.
Peaches this time, huh?
Oh Henry, can't
give away my secrets.
Where would we be
without a little mystery?
Bye.
There you go girl
hi
hi
uh...
Am I interrupting you?
no... ah...
no, I was just painting
um
oh
Thanks.
so? ah whats for eats?
looks good.
Where does she get
all this food from anyway?
There's no other
market around... ah
She must get it
all from you, right?
... I had a
delivery this morning
oh
Where's Mr. Hart?
Oh, he's a... sleeping
Just a little tired
oh
please stay for supper pike
I can't
Please ...
stay for supper Pike?
Why?
Look at the size of this trout.
gotta help me out here
besides
we haven't had a
meal together yet
I have to feed Frances first
okay
.... I have ta
stop by the house
okay
okay
okay
What are you doing?
Why'd you have to
cook such a big...
fish!
Oh, that one?
I can't seem to finish it
started in July
keep coming back to it though
it looks like...
Taurus
it is
The Pleiades’s
The seven daughters of Atlas
They were turned into stones
he felt...
such pity for them, that he
he turned them into stars
that's right
Ukuata.
they're also called
there's a ...
a myth in Onondaga tradition
please
okay, well, ah...
There was a...
a nation
a great nation
and...
they had set up camp
in the shadow of a mountain
near a lake
you see... the children
have this
nation
They had a favorite spot
this clearing in the trees
and
there they... they
danced a secret dance
that they invented
one day
a strange man appeared. he was
different then anything
they'd ever seen before
he had a
long, gray hair
flowing down his back
and this...
long robe
with white feathers
white as snow
he asked them
not ta
dance in this way
or they'd draw a terrible
occurrence upon themselves
but
they didn't listen
the dancing
always made them hungry
so they ran back
to the village
to ask their parents
for some food
to take up in the
mountain with them
but
they didn't believe
in wasting food on a...
children's picnic
so they left the
village with nothing
but still they danced
and danced
then...
mysteriously
they began to rise
and the emptiness... in their
bellies... made their heads light
the faster they danced
the higher they
rose into the air
they rose high enough that
their parents could see them
and they were terrified
they gathered up food...
in their arms and ran
towards their children
screaming and begging
them... to return and eat
but it was too late
the children already
belonged to the sky
they had flown too high
and their joy for dancing
on the air was too great
to have any memory of
the mountains
or the village
or the people who loved them
and kept rising...
and in time...
they reached the
ceiling of the heavens
and there they remain...
stars
dancing their secret dance
in a circle
yet, every now and then...
one of them
will remember his...
hunger
and love of his parents
who he can see beneath him
and his yearning...
grows so strong...
that he falls from the sky...
into his parents arms...
and returns home to his village.
Mrs Thayer? How's
