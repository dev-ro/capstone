{\an2}Driver's License.
{\an2}Take off your glasses.
{\an2}It's an 80 zone
and you were doing 116.
{\an2}My girlfriend's expecting me
for dinner.
{\an2}If I'm late, I'll be in trouble.
{\an2}Is it you who stinks of oil,
or your bike?
{\an2}Me, I've got a garage
up the way.
{\an2}I know.
{\an2}You eat with your girlfriend
smelling like that?
{\an2}She likes it.
{\an2}What, you smelling
like oil at dinner?
{\an2}She even starts purring.
{\an2}Hey!
{\an2}- My lion has a tummy ache.
- What?
{\an2}Your lion has a tummy ache?
{\an2}- Yes!
- Where does it hurt?
{\an2}There!
{\an2}That's where his tummy hurts?
{\an2}Show me, where?
{\an2}- There!
- Here? There?
{\an2}Ok, we'll take him to the hospital
for an operation, OK?
{\an2}Is it true that men are turned on
by words more than anything else?
{\an2}Say something
and see if I get turned on.
{\an2}Hello, my name is Julie,
I come from Paris
{\an2}and I haven't had sex for two years.
{\an2}Two years, no sex?
{\an2}- Oui.
- Why not?
{\an2}Went to jail
for indecent behavior.
{\an2}Is it working?
{\an2}Take off my panties.
{\an2}- You're not wearing any.
- Right.
{\an2}We can skip that nonsense.
Keep your hands where they are.
{\an2}Hello.
{\an2}Hello. I'm here to pick her up.
{\an2}Who are you?
{\an2}That's Top Lion.
{\an2}I'm Julia's boyfriend,
I came last week.
{\an2}Remember?
{\an2}You're not taking her
on the motorcycle, are you?
{\an2}No, we'll take the bus.
{\an2}But I want to go on the motorcycle.
{\an2}But that's illegal.
{\an2}Doesn't matter.
{\an2}It does matter.
{\an2}She's gone.
On you go.
{\an2}You can stay with us more often
if you want to.
{\an2}That's nice.
{\an2}Maybe I will.
{\an2}Mom thinks so too.
{\an2}Yeah? Did she say so?
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}Rosalie is hungry!
{\an2}What? Who?
{\an2}Rosalie is a princess.
{\an2}A hungry princess?
{\an2}Want to push and I'll ride?
{\an2}No.
{\an2}Grandpa!
{\an2}Sweetheart!
{\an2}My treasure.
{\an2}Dad, this is Erik.
{\an2}Erik, my father, Wolfgang.
{\an2}Oh yes. Weber.
{\an2}Keppler, Erik.
{\an2}He already wrote me a ticket.
{\an2}Great.
{\an2}Isn't it a bit impolite to offer
an oily hand to shake?
{\an2}Dad.
{\an2}What should I do?
It's less polite if I don't.
{\an2}You could have said, I'd like to shake
your hand, but mine is oily.
{\an2}Yes, I could have.
{\an2}Grandpa, I rode on the motorcycle.
{\an2}- I pushed the bike.
- But super fast.
{\an2}But I pushed it
and I washed my hands
{\an2}- even if it doesn't look like it.
- Are you hungry?
{\an2}- Well then. Bye Dad.
- Bye.
{\an2}- Bye Sweetheart.
- Bye Grandpa.
{\an2}- Well, I've got to go.
- See you soon.
{\an2}I think he likes me.
{\an2}Shit.
{\an2}So, that's my father.
{\an2}Usually he doesn't just show up.
{\an2}At least that's out of the way.
{\an2}I wanted to ask you a favor.
{\an2}Next weekend my dad is
in a Nordic walking contest.
{\an2}You know, with the poles?
{\an2}10 km in the woods and I wanted to ask
{\an2}if you would do it with him.
{\an2}He wants to do it with me?
{\an2}I think it'd be great.
{\an2}Next weekend?
{\an2}Maybe afterward,
you can sauna together
{\an2}and have a chat.
{\an2}If I asked you to...
{\an2}I would have done it.
{\an2}- No way!
- Sure I would have.
{\an2}Never.
{\an2}- Thanks!
- You gotta pay attention with a child.
{\an2}Linda, you can't just
run into the street, alright?
{\an2}You scared me. You can't
just run into the street, OK?
{\an2}- How was it at the playground today?
- Nice.
{\an2}You want another beer?
{\an2}Can you bring the olives?
{\an2}Everything OK?
{\an2}Erik?
{\an2}I'll be right back.
{\an2}A guy wearing a hooded parka
just came in here.
{\an2}Did you see him?
{\an2}No.
{\an2}The light was on.
{\an2}Can I come in?
{\an2}Wow.
{\an2}Nice bikes.
{\an2}Do you remember me?
{\an2}You were at the playground.
{\an2}Relax.
{\an2}We're on the same side.
{\an2}I know how it feels to be watched.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}What do you want?
{\an2}He'll find you.
It's only a matter of time.
{\an2}I found you too,
and I wasn't even looking.
{\an2}You can't hide.
{\an2}What's going on?
{\an2}You'll help me with Keitel.
You owe me.
{\an2}If not, I'll tell him where you are.
{\an2}Don't even think about it.
If anything happens to me,
{\an2}Keitel will definitely find you.
{\an2}Hey boys!
{\an2}Can you do me a favor?
{\an2}We don't talk to strangers.
{\an2}Did you say strangers
{\an2}since there are two of us
or in general?
{\an2}What?
{\an2}- Is someone behind me?
- Are you crazy?
{\an2}Do you think I'm crazy
because I'm asking
{\an2}or because it's obvious
that someone is there?
{\an2}Maybe he's invisible.
Does he make noise?
{\an2}- No, he's silent.
- Kill them.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}Kill them.
{\an2}- He spoke, did you hear him?
- No, what did he say?
{\an2}Is he there or not?
{\an2}Don't worry kids.
{\an2}Why should we be worried?
{\an2}Quick, let's go!
{\an2}Humor is not your thing, eh?
{\an2}Go away!
{\an2}Pile of shit.
What a joke!
{\an2}It's not working again!
{\an2}This crap!
{\an2}Shit!
{\an2}I've got a question,
{\an2}not for me,
a friend of mine.
{\an2}I'm really worried about him.
{\an2}He has hallucinations.
{\an2}He sees a guy following him.
{\an2}Only he can see him.
{\an2}I see.
{\an2}I wanted to know
if such an illness existed.
{\an2}He definitely sees him.
{\an2}It's not like he's partly clear,
{\an2}but like...
{\an2}- As if he were really right beside him.
- What do you mean?
{\an2}If such an illness exists?
What else could it be?
{\an2}I don't know.
{\an2}Why didn't your friend come himself?
{\an2}I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't like hospitals.
{\an2}The question is
what kind of therapy is there?
{\an2}I would send your friend
{\an2}to a psychiatric clinic,
{\an2}and then
{\an2}it would be diagnosed.
{\an2}Look at his socks.
He needs a doctor himself.
{\an2}- Can't you just give me some pills?
- No.
{\an2}You have to go to a psychiatrist.
{\an2}This man, does he talk to your friend?
{\an2}- Or tell him what to do?
- If you say yes,
{\an2}he can put you away
against your will, so shut up.
{\an2}I'd like to give you
{\an2}something to calm you down, OK?
{\an2}That's not OK at all!
He'll sedate you and lock you up.
{\an2}That's not OK at all!
{\an2}Listen,
{\an2}this won't go away on it's own.
{\an2}Instead of doing nothing,
{\an2}there may be another way.
{\an2}Tell her I sent you, OK?
{\an2}She's not a trained doctor, but...
{\an2}she has certain abilities.
{\an2}- The village hooker?
- Don't be shocked by appearances.
{\an2}I was also very skeptical.
{\an2}But maybe she can help you.
{\an2}Maybe.
{\an2}Hey, cool down, don't panic.
{\an2}Hey!
{\an2}I'm here to help!
{\an2}I'm Henry by the way.
{\an2}I don't know how to thank you.
{\an2}Hello.
{\an2}Do you have an appointment?
{\an2}- No. Dr. Weihe sent me.
- He's doing better?
{\an2}I don't know.
{\an2}Sorry...
{\an2}Can I ask what you do?
{\an2}We have a talent
{\an2}and we try to use it to help.
{\an2}What's she mean "we"?
{\an2}Are there more chicks?
We could do a gang bang.
{\an2}Please sit.
{\an2}Tell me.
{\an2}There's someone with me.
{\an2}And only I can see him.
{\an2}I want to know if
it's a ghost or only in my head.
{\an2}I want to get rid of him.
{\an2}- Is he here now?
- Yes.
{\an2}- Where?
- He's standing next to me.
{\an2}How long has he been there?
{\an2}For a few days,
farther away at first,
{\an2}but he comes closer.
He just sat down.
{\an2}- Do you know him?
- No.
{\an2}Have you seen him before?
{\an2}He seems familiar,
{\an2}but more like
I've dreamt of him before.
{\an2}Does he speak to you?
{\an2}- Yes.
- Is he speaking now?
{\an2}- Fuck you.
- Not now, but earlier he did.
{\an2}- What did he say?
- He said
{\an2}why is she saying "we"
and something about a group.
{\an2}Find a spot in my eyes.
{\an2}Focus on it.
{\an2}- What's your name?
- Erik Keppler.
{\an2}Relax.
How old are you?
{\an2}40.
{\an2}-What do you do?
- Repair motorcycles.
{\an2}Ask him what he wants.
{\an2}- What do you want?
- I want to rip off her leggings
{\an2}- and fuck Satan out of her body.
- He's not answering.
{\an2}Are you telling the truth?
What's your name?
{\an2}- I just told you.
- Answer if you want my help.
{\an2}- What's your name?
- Erik Keppler.
{\an2}Focus on my eyes.
{\an2}- Do you repair motorbikes?
- Yes.
{\an2}Have you ever caused
a person's death?
{\an2}What? No!
{\an2}Relax.
{\an2}Deep.
{\an2}Deeper.
{\an2}Don't let her do this to you.
It's no good.
{\an2}It's alright.
{\an2}What's your name?
{\an2}Erik Keppler.
{\an2}Look at him.
{\an2}Ask him what he wants.
{\an2}- What do you want?
- To help you!
{\an2}Go deeper.
{\an2}Tell him to go.
{\an2}- Go away!
- Order him.
{\an2}- Get out of my life!
- No!
{\an2}- Be stronger than him.
- You let this whore push you around?
{\an2}Can't you see what she's after?
{\an2}- Your arms are numb!
- He is manipulating you.
{\an2}- Your arms can't move!
- My arms can't move!
{\an2}- Your arms are fine. Deeper!
- You don't want this. Fight!
{\an2}- What did you say? My arms!
- Your arms are fine.
{\an2}- Deeper.
- Fight her!
{\an2}- Take the needle out!
- You have to endure it!
{\an2}- My arms won't move.
- You sad piece of shit! Fight!
{\an2}Why are you touching me?
{\an2}You don't exist.
{\an2}You can't hurt me,
{\an2}'cause you don't exist.
{\an2}Then everything's fine.
{\an2}Cheers.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}You could be a bit nicer.
{\an2}You think I like hanging out
in this shit hole?
{\an2}Erik?
{\an2}Fuck.
{\an2}I heard that.
{\an2}Why are you with
that bitch anyway?
{\an2}Want a drink with me?
{\an2}Or keep on pretending
you have to work.
{\an2}Sounds like you gonna hear
why you're a shitty husband, don't it?
{\an2}Hey.
{\an2}Quit screwing around with that.
{\an2}I'm sorry if it's been too much
with Lini and my father.
{\an2}It's not that.
{\an2}Of course it is!
{\an2}Is there something wrong?
{\an2}You're the best thing
to happen to me in a long time,
{\an2}and I want to be with you.
{\an2}God, this is sick.
{\an2}But right now...
{\an2}Yeah?
{\an2}I'm scared.
{\an2}Of what?
{\an2}Do me a favor.
{\an2}Fuck the bitch already,
you're boring me to death.
{\an2}Let's go for a ride.
{\an2}Hanging around here
is making you crazy. - Don't be mad,
{\an2}- I gotta finish up.
- We don't have to talk.
{\an2}Right, nothing to talk about...
{\an2}You know what happens
if you don't tell her? It's over.
{\an2}She obviously digs you,
but think about it,
{\an2}the bikes, the tattoos,
you're nothing
{\an2}but a distraction
from her boring life.
{\an2}Come on.
{\an2}Why let the dumb cow turn you
into someone you're not?
{\an2}Why?!
{\an2}When she learns you're nuts
she'll leave you anyway.
{\an2}Why don't you tell her
how Linda almost got run over,
{\an2}- 'cause you didn't watch her?
- Fuck off!
{\an2}OK.
{\an2}A very critical moment.
{\an2}Did you see how she looked at you?
She doubts your whole relationship.
{\an2}Is that the first time?
It's the beginning of the end.
{\an2}- What?
- Wait.
{\an2}Listen to me and trust me,
just this once.
{\an2}Listen carefully to this guy.
{\an2}If you do, I'll leave you alone
tonight for your reconciliation fuck.
{\an2}Still pretending?
{\an2}Or are you going to hear me out?
{\an2}I'm all ears.
{\an2}There's a club.
{\an2}Keitel just took it over.
You'll go there.
{\an2}I'll tell you where and when
and take care of the rest.
{\an2}- Ask him what club.
- Don't tell me what to do.
{\an2}Paranoid Keitel made
a list because of you.
{\an2}- I'm the only one left alive.
- I'm so sorry.
{\an2}- You leave me no choice.
- Don't let him do it.
{\an2}- I'll call him.
- Tell him you'll do it.
{\an2}Don't let him call.
{\an2}Do it.
{\an2}Call him.
{\an2}You goddamn idiot.
{\an2}- Yeah.
- Hansen,
{\an2}it's Gaspar.
{\an2}Give me Keitel.
{\an2}Why should he talk to you?
{\an2}Tell him Zille is alive.
{\an2}And I know where he is.
{\an2}It's your last chance.
{\an2}Tell him you'll slaughter him
if he doesn't hang up now.
{\an2}Now!
{\an2}Good.
Fine.
{\an2}- Klangendorf is the place.
- You've no idea what you've done.
{\an2}Meeting at Luisen Street.
In the empty building
{\an2}They're coming, tonight.
{\an2}I've listened to your nonsense.
Now, leave me alone.
{\an2}You act as if you've
never done this before.
{\an2}You remember the deal?
{\an2}If you get it up,
you get your money,
{\an2}if not,
you get hit.
{\an2}Got it?
{\an2}- I no understand.
- No understand.
{\an2}No understand German.
What do I do with her?
{\an2}Get out.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}Zille is alive.
{\an2}Get me out of here.
{\an2}Julia, I'm sorry.
{\an2}Let's ride and talk a bit, OK?
{\an2}- Julia.
- Only if I can drive.
{\an2}No way.
{\an2}Then, no.
{\an2}I went to the doctor today.
{\an2}That's why I came late
to the daycare.
{\an2}Why?
{\an2}I told you about
my nightmares, didn't I?
{\an2}They've gotten worse.
{\an2}I have problems in the day now, too.
{\an2}It's so bad that
I'm seeing things,
{\an2}things that aren't there.
{\an2}What kinds of things?
{\an2}I start thinking,
I'm being followed.
{\an2}OK.
{\an2}I can deal with it,
but I need to do it on my own.
{\an2}- I want to keep you out of it.
- No, no, no.
{\an2}That's exactly the wrong way.
{\an2}Don't think
you're scaring me away.
{\an2}I'm here.
{\an2}For you. OK?
{\an2}Sometimes it feels so real
that I can't tell
{\an2}what's real
and what's not.
{\an2}I'm real.
{\an2}What do you have for us?
{\an2}First, I want a guarantee
that my name's off the list...
{\an2}You have it.
{\an2}- From Keitel?
- Yes.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}Want a bouquet?
{\an2}It's all here.
{\an2}The garage's address,
{\an2}and his girlfriend's, Julia Weber.
{\an2}I've also got a note.
{\an2}A message from Keitel.
{\an2}I wrote it down.
I couldn't remember it all.
{\an2}It says,
{\an2}"You fucking rat,
{\an2}you think I'd do business
with a gypsy faggot?"
{\an2}Then, more insults.
{\an2}Blah blah, and then,
{\an2}"Beat him and make it hurt."
{\an2}OK,
{\an2}that last part was for me.
{\an2}You're pretty stupid, aren't you?
{\an2}Believing in words of honor.
{\an2}What kind of world do you live in?
{\an2}So sorry.
{\an2}You don't have to hide
your hand from me.
{\an2}- Hello.
- Hello.
{\an2}I think I understand
how you can get used to this crap.
{\an2}But, unfortunately, it's not real.
{\an2}And you know that.
{\an2}Let it go.
{\an2}You'll lose it anyway.
{\an2}- Yesterday was nice.
- Say it loud, horny milf.
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}Hi.
{\an2}Hey.
{\an2}- Our birthday girl!
- Happy birthday!
{\an2}- She won't take the costume off.
- I'm a Vicky and you're Halvar.
{\an2}Did you know there
was a cool Viking named Erik?
{\an2}No, you're Halvar the Top Lion!
{\an2}OK.
{\an2}Happy birthday, kiddo.
{\an2}- A present!
- Yep.
{\an2}It's a Paradont rabbit.
{\an2}He gets tooth aches
but he's still sweet.
{\an2}Look Rosalie, a rabbit.
{\an2}I also have a friend
whom only I can see.
{\an2}He's sitting there.
{\an2}I don't believe you.
{\an2}It's true, unfortunately.
{\an2}- What's his name?
- His name is Henry.
{\an2}Hello Henry.
{\an2}- Hello Linda.
- Want to play with us, Henry?
{\an2}You...
{\an2}- Then I'll be the ugly aluminum head.
- You're...
{\an2}You're the fairy pony.
{\an2}- I'm the fairy pony. Who are you?
- I'm Vicky.
{\an2}All this isn't real.
{\an2}It'll soon be over.
{\an2}Grandpa is here.
{\an2}- My rabbit is hungry, Henry.
- I don't care, so shut the fuck up.
{\an2}- Who is Henry?
- My new friend.
{\an2}- And Rosalie?
- She's dead. - Oh really?
{\an2}That's sad.
{\an2}So?
{\an2}What did you do in Berlin
before you came here?
{\an2}I was in gastronomy.
{\an2}Doing what exactly?
{\an2}Don't let him interrogate you.
{\an2}I was a cook
in a couple of restaurants.
{\an2}No good.
Not even your chick believes you.
{\an2}You could cook for us then.
{\an2}You weren't a mechanic in Berlin then?
{\an2}No.
{\an2}But you drove a motorcycle, right?
{\an2}What are you getting at?
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}I checked up on you a bit.
{\an2}- And?
- Since you moved here, you've had 15,
{\an2}no 16 traffic tickets.
{\an2}- That's a lot for two years.
- Could be worse.
{\an2}Could be worse, right?
{\an2}Yeah, but what's interesting
is before you came here.
{\an2}True.
{\an2}You don't like to talk
about the past, do you?
{\an2}I ran a red light?
{\an2}No.
{\an2}Nothing, not a single ticket.
{\an2}Then 16 in two years?
{\an2}So?
{\an2}That doesn't seem likely.
{\an2}A city guy like you doesn't
move out to cruise the countryside.
{\an2}A cook who opens
a motorcycle garage?
{\an2}- I don't believe a word you say.
- Dad stop.
{\an2}- Do you have children?
- The tension grows.
{\an2}Were you married?
{\an2}Were you married?
{\an2}Do you have children?
{\an2}No.
{\an2}Any family at all?
{\an2}My wife
{\an2}died in a fire
a few years ago.
{\an2}She was pregnant.
{\an2}This is my new start.
{\an2}I gave up everything
{\an2}and left it behind.
{\an2}I'd like to change the subject.
{\an2}I don't like remembering
or being reminded of it.
{\an2}I just want to forget.
{\an2}Chapeau.
{\an2}Customers of mine.
{\an2}What do you want?
{\an2}Calm down.
{\an2}We're moving tonight.
{\an2}This will get you in.
The address is on the back.
{\an2}Deisler is covering security
at Heaven.
{\an2}- The rest is like we said.
- Like who said?
{\an2}- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What do you mean?
{\an2}Like I said, I don't know.
{\an2}Look, I'm Erik Keppler.
{\an2}No one else,
no matter what you think.
{\an2}And now fuck off.
Leave me alone.
{\an2}You psycho really believe
what you're saying. Have a look.
{\an2}Just don't flip out.
{\an2}Maybe this will jog your memory.
{\an2}You are Zille.
{\an2}Thomas Zillewski.
{\an2}You did this.
{\an2}Had to happen.
{\an2}You'll be at that club.
Alzheimer's or not.
{\an2}We're in this shit together.
{\an2}Do you want Keitel
to show up in her living room?
{\an2}Do you want to watch your family die?
{\an2}You show up.
{\an2}Just be there.
We'll take care of the rest.
{\an2}Believe it or not,
I'm saving your ass right now.
{\an2}What's wrong?
{\an2}- Was I with you all last night?
- Yes, of course.
{\an2}All night, are you sure?
{\an2}Yes, I don't know.
You always get up at night.
{\an2}Erik?
{\an2}- I'm not right for her.
- Now, calm down.
{\an2}- What did they want?
- Look after her.
{\an2}- Leave for a few days.
- You shouldn't be afraid of those guys.
{\an2}- Where are you going?
- Do what I say.
{\an2}What did they say?
{\an2}Fuck, Erik! Stay here!
{\an2}Hey. You could thank me.
I did save your life.
{\an2}My life was fine
before you came along.
{\an2}Go on ignoring what you don't like.
You know what your life is?
{\an2}- A goddamn lie!
- Nonsense.
{\an2}Yeah? You remember so well, eh?
{\an2}Your wife died in a fire?
{\an2}- You know nothing.
- Then explain.
{\an2}I am only a part of you.
{\an2}I can't tell you
if you don't want to know.
{\an2}- You're an illness, not a part of me.
- Whatever you say.
{\an2}- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.
{\an2}This cunt can't help you either.
{\an2}I'll do anything,
just get rid of him.
{\an2}I can only treat you
by talking directly to him.
{\an2}How will you do it?
{\an2}You have to allow it.
{\an2}I'm scared to lose control.
{\an2}Lie down.
{\an2}Trust me. It'll be fine.
{\an2}Focus on the pencil tip.
{\an2}I'm not going away.
{\an2}I'm not going away.
{\an2}- See what happens.
- Trust me. It'll be fine.
{\an2}Focus on the pencil tip.
{\an2}I'll go look for him.
{\an2}Can you watch Linda?
{\an2}Stay here, it won't help.
{\an2}Dad,
{\an2}just shut up.
{\an2}Julia Weber?
{\an2}Yes?
{\an2}Are you awake?
{\an2}I want to wash my hands.
{\an2}Can you untie me?
{\an2}Who is speaking now?
{\an2}Your fucking travel guide.
{\an2}- Untie me now.
- Henry?
{\an2}You, witch doctor.
{\an2}Bondage usually turns me on.
{\an2}We both know you have no idea
what you're doing. Untie me.
{\an2}I'm going to put
more needles in your face.
{\an2}- Don't move. It'll hurt.
- No! Untie me!
{\an2}Untie me you dumb cunt!
{\an2}You want to exorcise the demon?
{\an2}How do you know I'm not sick?
{\an2}Maybe Erik's the demon.
Have you thought about that?
{\an2}You didn't.
{\an2}What now?
{\an2}What now?
{\an2}What happened?
{\an2}- Didn't it work?
- Yes, it did.
{\an2}But...
{\an2}You tell, the man does things,
{\an2}you cannot control,
{\an2}evil things.
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}That's your true character,
{\an2}your true soul.
{\an2}You are
{\an2}the brain disease,
{\an2}- not him.
- That's not true.
{\an2}For now, we have
placed one needle
{\an2}to serve as a blockage.
{\an2}If you pull it out, you will become
{\an2}what you really are,
{\an2}forever.
{\an2}It's your decision.
{\an2}You still don't believe it.
{\an2}Pull it out.
{\an2}Very bad idea.
{\an2}- I'm going there.
- Then you're dead.
{\an2}If I don't,
my family is in danger.
{\an2}Your family.
{\an2}You don't have a family.
{\an2}Forget the chick.
{\an2}You don't love her.
{\an2}You know why?
{\an2}Because you can't.
{\an2}Can you feel
the adrenaline?
{\an2}Boss,
{\an2}Zille is here, in Heaven.
{\an2}What do you think
is going to happen now?
{\an2}He said
all I have to do is be here.
{\an2}Get out!
{\an2}Don't let him out.
{\an2}Is this a tape or live?
{\an2}It's a tape.
{\an2}- Where's he now?
- Hiding in the WC.
{\an2}- Are there cameras?
- No.
{\an2}- Another exit?
- No.
{\an2}How many guys do we have?
{\an2}- 10.
- Get more.
{\an2}He's shitting himself in the toilets,
why do we need more guys?
{\an2}Because it can only be a trap!
{\an2}- Did he say what he wants?
- No.
{\an2}- You go talk to him.
- Just talk?
{\an2}He'll have a bargaining chip.
{\an2}If not, beat him up.
{\an2}But I want to be there
when he dies.
{\an2}Don't give me that arrogant sneer.
{\an2}- Wait.
- They're here.
{\an2}Bring them in.
{\an2}What the ...?
{\an2}- Who are these clowns?
-The girlfriend and her dad,
{\an2}the townspeople said.
{\an2}So little one,
{\an2}come here.
{\an2}- What's your name?
- Linda.
{\an2}- How old are you, Linda?
- Five.
{\an2}- What do you want from us?
- Don't talk unless I ask a question.
{\an2}Do you know him?
{\an2}- Is that your dad?
- That's Top Lion.
{\an2}So, he's not your dad?
{\an2}He doesn't live with us.
{\an2}Who? Top Lion or your dad?
{\an2}My dad doesn't live with us.
{\an2}Then that man there
isn't your dad?
{\an2}That's Top Lion,
he gave me this rabbit.
{\an2}But is he your dad or not?
{\an2}- He's not her dad.
- I didn't ask you!
{\an2}Is that your dad?
{\an2}What's so hard
about the question, Linda?
{\an2}Is that your dad or not?
{\an2}- Yes or no?
- No.
{\an2}- Good Linda, you're a great girl.
- Thank you.
{\an2}Would you bring Linda out of here?
{\an2}- Let me go! Where's he taking her?
- We're doing what you say!
{\an2}- A little girl shouldn't see this.
- I'll...
{\an2}Calm down.
{\an2}So, you're his girlfriend?
{\an2}Yes, and I'm a police officer.
{\an2}Oh, a cop.
{\an2}Your boyfriend,
{\an2}do you love him?
{\an2}Do you love him?
{\an2}He didn't even tell you his real name.
{\an2}The Zille that I know
{\an2}uses women like fuckdolls
{\an2}and throws them away
when he's done.
{\an2}For the rest of your life
you are going to suck 50 dicks a day
{\an2}in a whorehouse in the Ukraine.
{\an2}What did you do with her?
{\an2}Hands on the wall.
{\an2}Are you unarmed?
{\an2}Did that hurt?
{\an2}Help me.
{\an2}- I'll do.
- What did you say?
{\an2}You're such a whiny pile of shit.
{\an2}Please.
{\an2}Admit it,
{\an2}that your whole life is a lie.
{\an2}Get Julia and the little one out.
{\an2}OK.
{\an2}You promise?
{\an2}I promise.
{\an2}And now,
{\an2}admit it,
{\an2}that your life is a goddamn lie.
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}Who am I?
{\an2}You, my friend,
{\an2}are the bad guy.
{\an2}Latecomers
make the worst guests.
{\an2}Let me in,
we gotta talk.
{\an2}- You'll survive.
- You look like hell.
{\an2}But I'm doing great.
{\an2}What are you doing here?
{\an2}Is that how you greet
your brother-in-law?
{\an2}Glad to see you too.
{\an2}- I gotta talk to my brother.
- Go back to bed.
{\an2}Now I'm awake.
{\an2}- I'll make a tea.
- Two sugars.
{\an2}Let's go upstairs.
{\an2}Impressive.
{\an2}You've got a little kingdom here.
{\an2}Spare me the sarcasm.
What do you want?
{\an2}No thanks,
I don't smoke anymore.
{\an2}That's no surprise.
{\an2}Remember what dad said
when I beat you up?
{\an2}You beat me up?
I remember it differently.
{\an2}He said I shouldn't
because you're my brother.
{\an2}Brothers should
always help each other.
{\an2}Right, brothers should
always help each other.
{\an2}You remember the garage?
You can join in anytime.
{\an2}- Fuck your garage.
- What do you want?
{\an2}- I wanted to ask you a favor.
- What?
{\an2}- It's a bit heavy.
- What do you want? Money?
{\an2}I want to invite you on a trip.
{\an2}You, me, Karin...
{\an2}We'll find an island far away.
{\an2}Sooth the soul a bit, yeah?
{\an2}A trip? Are you nuts?
{\an2}I can't go on vacation,
I've got the garage.
{\an2}OK, the truth is
I underestimated someone.
{\an2}I didn't finish something
the way I should have.
{\an2}If he finds out I got a brother,
then you're in danger.
{\an2}You're pulling my leg, right?
{\an2}This is the best I could get.
{\an2}I'll get you IDs, too.
{\an2}- A ticket to a new life.
- You're an asshole.
{\an2}Get out.
{\an2}Get out.
{\an2}- Fuck off!
- Wait, you don't get it. Look, money.
{\an2}It's all yours. Fuck your garage.
You can get another,
{\an2}bigger, better, someday,
{\an2}but now we have to go.
{\an2}Karin is pregnant.
{\an2}I'm so sorry.
{\an2}- Asshole!
- I'm sorry. I fucked up. We have to go.
{\an2}Now!
{\an2}Is she alright?
{\an2}Is everything OK?
{\an2}Nothing happened?
{\an2}Is everything...
{\an2}It's alright, it's alright.
{\an2}Pull yourself together.
{\an2}Let's go.
{\an2}Get up.
{\an2}You can take it pretty good.
{\an2}Because you hit like a girl.
{\an2}Now I'm coming to get you.
{\an2}That's where talking will get you.
{\an2}Block the entrances.
He can't finish this alone.
{\an2}- How many are we?
- 15 are here 10 more are coming.
{\an2}What was your name?
{\an2}Deisler.
{\an2}So?
{\an2}How many of those guys
did that gyppo bring?
{\an2}Not a lot.
{\an2}Most of them are our guys.
{\an2}Maybe you can tell our guys
about the new situation then?
{\an2}Are you scared?
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}Me too.
{\an2}Now!
{\an2}The exits are blocked.
{\an2}What now?
{\an2}How should I know?
Sit here and chitchat?
{\an2}What if he doesn't
give a shit about her?
{\an2}- Then you've got a problem.
- Shut up.
{\an2}Zille.
{\an2}Keitel.
{\an2}Hansen.
{\an2}Before we all blow each other away,
{\an2}let's just relax and
I'll tell you how I see things, OK?
{\an2}I've got a new whore at home.
{\an2}She's from Bulgaria and
she massages my nuts like no other.
{\an2}I want to go home to her tonight.
{\an2}I'll let your girl and the family go.
{\an2}You live your new life with her.
{\an2}Does that sound
like a reasonable end?
{\an2}I don't believe it.
{\an2}- You want revenge.
- Zille, I'm almost 50.
{\an2}I can't walk right
since you shot me into a cripple.
{\an2}But you've paid
for what you did to me.
{\an2}The death of your brother
{\an2}and his wife
was enough revenge for me.
{\an2}Then you show up again
after five years.
{\an2}What would you have done?
{\an2}I wasn't going to wait
till you come to finish me off.
{\an2}We don't have to end this
in a bloodbath, Zille.
{\an2}His guys are everywhere.
{\an2}Yours couldn't handle them.
{\an2}I hardly know the girl
you're hiding behind.
{\an2}A pussy with no hourly rate.
{\an2}That's over now.
Do as you please with her.
{\an2}Quite honestly,
{\an2}- you got nothing.
- What do you want then, asshole?
{\an2}I want my old life back.
{\an2}With all the perks.
{\an2}Gaspar and I take over the business.
{\an2}Hansen keeps the clubs
and is a shareholder.
{\an2}And you,
{\an2}you retire.
{\an2}And get out of here alive.
{\an2}If you remind me of
my brother ever again,
{\an2}you'll eat your guts.
{\an2}What's with these two,
and the child?
{\an2}I don't care.
{\an2}Good.
{\an2}We take the woman and child,
{\an2}and the cop dies.
{\an2}One question
{\an2}you've got to answer.
{\an2}If you drink with me.
{\an2}I always thought I knew you,
{\an2}my soul mate.
{\an2}No one was as extreme as we were.
{\an2}We raised hell, didn't we?
{\an2}Was that the question?
{\an2}Why did you want to kill me?
{\an2}Greed.
{\an2}I wanted it all.
{\an2}That's what I thought
until you came in here
{\an2}and held your little speech.
{\an2}Then it dawned on me!
{\an2}You wanted to quit back then,
{\an2}but you were afraid
I wouldn't let you.
{\an2}Deep down inside,
{\an2}you were always
a boring normal fuck.
{\an2}She's not nothing to you.
{\an2}You love her.
{\an2}The show you're putting on here
{\an2}is one giant pile of shit.
{\an2}Now, give up and
let yourself be tortured to death.
{\an2}If you don't,
{\an2}you will watch while
{\an2}I hack your lady and
her daughter into pieces.
{\an2}Can I ask you something?
{\an2}Your Bulgarian whore,
{\an2}she can play with
your balls all day,
{\an2}but nothing happens, right?
Not a thing.
{\an2}Life is shit, Zille.
{\an2}Lini!
{\an2}I've had it.
{\an2}I know.
{\an2}Remember what dad always said?
{\an2}Tell me.
{\an2}He said,
{\an2}"The good ones can take it,
{\an2}and the bad ones are no loss."
