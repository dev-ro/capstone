Really nice butt. -Really
You think I have a chance? -No.

I have one, thanks.
Samaèki-life suits you.

Your mom loved this place.
-Michelle, do you see with what?
Good day.
Critic.
-Well, actually you have taken.
We do burgers and shakes,
just for you.
And I thought it would be British cuisine with
a touch of Provence and Tuscany tones.
Especially Thai
- Szechuanski impact and everything
is on the grill?
You must have ?tapiæe.
-Sorry.
No dose of Provence
or Tuscany tones.
No Catalonskih influence
and cantonal tones.
Danish elements.
Danish-elements?
No. No Danish elements, and even
California. Absolutely not ...
No rainbow effect. Whatever.
We serve the best British
ingredients
and treat them with the respected French techniques.
Is that right?
Is that so? -She said.
Then I was impressed.
-She is the boss.
Never work with a daughter.
Perfect.
Here it is.
The boss was still in the "boots".
-Great news.
It would be a disaster.
A bunch of people will overwhelm
the village of cars.
As your entertainment, Max.
-This is different.
And the last was for Kate.
It was?
We have 23 complaints
from the council.
New record.
It would be nice to have something local for otièi.
I would not be enough to cook.
It could make a good toast.
-This is more than you do.
I was a few weeks ago at his
restaurant in London.
I think the crowd will
not be a problem.
Now again, staring at my butt?
It is nice shape, huh?
What do you think
is good enough?
Do you want to compress it a quickie
to see if it is ripe?
Do you want a cup of tea?
Sugar cube. -I want one.
We'll miss the flight.
-I am going to just say hi.
Do it when you go back.
-Then it might be too late.
Move this lovely antique piece of equipment.
-It is very precious.
Damn.
Idiot!
I'm really sorry.
Are you all right?
-Almost killed me.
Sorry.
A little reorganizing.
Surely you all right?
I am Rob.
-Max Templeton.
I live around the corner.
Would you like to drink?
Cup of tea? No, thanks.
Kate told me all about your plans.
-Kate? -My daughter.

I do not know, it's all
luck and timing.
What should I do?

I will come in a minute.
Can I help you? -Rob Haley? -Yes.
-James Forrester.
I own a piece of land here.
Oh, sorry.
Well, gastronomic oasis, huh?
A good pot of English,
she said Kate.
Your friend?
-A little more than
that if we on this?
Well, the lamb in a sauce of mint and blackcurrant
syrup, something like that?
Can I add a spatula? Voæni-cake?
And the screws.
To keep away pests gmi?uæu?
That's the idea.
Then, using sound and proven
methods of the Gestapo.
I expect great things.
-So I hope that you will
not disappoint.
You will not. Goodbye.
Only a small reminder.
That's it. Start.
Almost.
Come on.
Well, that's pretty unequivocal.
NO DOGS OR Critics
So what do you think?
-No triflea?
Yes, what about trifleima.
I love triflee.

Where is Michelle? -Outside.
D you okay?
What happened?
-Nothing happened, Dad.
I drove down the road ...
-If you were not one of
those damned driver

they kill someone.
To get back to America, this would be a lot safer.
Come on.
Fast driving is a bit sensitive topic with him.
Calm will be zaèas.
No, I will not damn.
I'm not quite as fast vehicles.
You can consider me another stupid
American, but I am not so stupid.

It seems like a good
enough boy, for art.
To whom do you think?
-This type of boots.
Oh, Rob.
Yes, great. Really great.
I've read your criticism
of his shop in London.
I'm sure you will make out of
this mess that you wrote.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
-Of course it deserves.
The James, please!
Kate, we were damn
good together.
Oh, come on!
Look what you made.
These are just a slut for dry cleaning.

This is a disaster.
Are you looking for trouble?
No, but it is little
unable to move.
I am nowhere mièem.
You are the ones who'll
be removed.
Max. Traitors.
Take a minute, if you want, a man
shouted over his shoulder,
and disappeared in the murmur of
voices and a cloud of smoke.
Simpatièna I have,
is that right?
Anyway.
Good night.
Firmly to sleep.
Fleas and bitten all night.
Love me.
Hi. -Hi.

Keep your finger on the edge.
Short Cuts.
Look carefully, keep your fingers on the top plate

Do not make me look like this.

Ahh, paradise lost.

It is just a car anymore.
He is a great guy and a phenomenal cook,
and what gives results in pleasure.
Many of the people.
On my tab.
-It has always been
about you, do not.
What do you mean?
-It is always how you want or
how you want to look like.
Nonsense.
Before it was a rock 'n' roll and samaèki life,
and now the peace and to be my father.
So I have no ease.
You stepped on my mother side.
Are you serious?
I had twelve years, how's your
whoredom might be my fault?
You're gone.
I did not mean to hurt anyone.
-But you do that.

redeemed. -I know.
I'm going to walk back. -Yes.

little daughter.
Well, because ?????. -Good.
I need something to tell you.
It's been a long time.
Me too.

Good advice from technology? No.
Always critic.
What do I get? A few notes?
Assessment of up to ten?
Is is worth next visit?
Is it worth the trip?
Three.
-Three?
-Three stars out of five.
Believe me, you do not want five.
I do not want? -No.
Five stars of five,

This is not good in bed,
just terrifying.
But eight ...

It is much better.
So I need ...
You need some practice.

Well, come here.

Surely you all right? -It was the first place.
I should be.
Good.

What are you here for?
-We have a complaint.
What kind of complaints?
-I can not tell you.
Who was it?
-They should know better
than that, sir.
Would you like coffee?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
It's disgusting.
I will give you an official warning.
Violate the regulations
on health standards.
I do not want to let the public figure in London turned the
entire area around the parking lot and destroyed them all.
For myself, you mean.
-For everyone.
Change panels, dear.
You did not had a hit for years.
I guess boiled egg out
of the question?
Good morning, Daddy.
Good morning?
I have a surprise for you.

Across the open mouth.

Unbelievable, huh? -Absolutely.

a daughter Najsladi.
Then you happy here?
Are you okay? -Never better, dear.
Never better.
No.
I have a search warrant.
-Of course. For what?
Excuse me, sir, I can tell you.
-Of course you can. Come inside.
What the hell you think?
It is only 15 grams of marijuana.
I'm not sold.
How the hell knew?
-I have no idea.
The only thing I pljugao
with Kate.
What is it?
Closed-you, on behalf
of municipalities.
Call. There are many complaints.
You are no longer welcome.
You know, the guy who gets to deliver
or else £ 10 per hour.
I gave him 200 to allow
me to provide such.
The best money I ever spent.
And one more thing.
It is mine.
Miei hands with her.
Be a good boy.
Otherwise things will
really zagu?vati.
I almost forgot.
Have you ever wondered who wrote
the critique is in your kitchen?
Kate.
I see that you know.
Well done. Pametnjakoviæ.
See you next Tuesday.
Kate's boyfriend and her
father had locked us up.
Kate has a boyfriend?
Hi.
Good morning to you too.
Why is mrgud? -They closed us.
What?
Kate leave him alone.
They can not do. -Yes.
What can I do? -You already done enough.
-What do you mean?
Your father, Forrester appealed.
And your boyfriend left this.
Oh my God. -So, yours are?
He is my boy.
I swear that I do not
know where he got.
Who told them to lngovu grass?
-I thought it was funny.
It was absolutely bloody hilarious.
-I am so sorry.
And do you know anything about this?
-I was trying to tell you.
Of course you did.
Get out.
About Rob please,
does not make it.
Get out.
Cooked before you shit,
and you know it.
And if you think I screwed
up, you know me well.
Now I know the truth. Get out.
Just because a woman is dead and you have a sweet daughter,
does not give you the right to be an asshole.
Well, thank you.
Hi. Close the door on the
way out. And Kate.
Make me a favor.
Do not get rid of Michelle.
What the hell?
Hey!
Hey!
What the hell to do?
What is it?
Are you Rob Haley? -Yes! -Good.
His Majesty will be
here at eleven.
You need to be ready by then
or we will be hellish.
Which Royal Majesty? -Guy ...
Witherspoon.
Lars!
If we close, we have one great
moment, if we do not know.
Who will cook? You?
Too bad it's heated up
in the microwave.
This warm up.
And everything will be fine.
Did you see what the critics gave
the gastro-pub last week?
It was a cold-blooded murder.
Gonna be good.
-Of course I will. Will be good.
They would have been better
if Kate is here.
Michelle, sometimes adults stop.
Come on, come on and give me a hug for good luck.
Keep on truckin '.
So, a glass of wine can get when I finish?
Is that Tanya? -To Guy.
I hope you are all aware that this
kit keeps hanging in the closet.
You can do it.
-Of course you can.
-Gonna be great, really great.
I fucked up, huh? -Yes. Pretty.
Critics have which should impress.
-Thank God.
What about hearing?
Well, if you do not want us here, we can go somewhere where we want.
Can we?
Let's go!
For how long G.
Forrester?
-It should be here
within minutes.
At my signal, unleash hell.
Where is Mr.
Haley?
-You probably realized
that it lost the case.
I'm sorry I'm late.
-Kate, dear.
I'm so glad you came.
Oh, yeah?
How about dinner tonight? To celebrate.
-Ouu.
Could you reload it back
into your collection.
Gap is already behaving like this for ten
years, and I think a crush on you.
How do you know?
Mr. Templeton will not join us this morning, but
he wants to withdraw all their objections.
What?
And I am here on behalf of Mr.
Haley.
-Kate. You can not. -Look at me.
Can we start with this? Please.
Good.
Let's start with rats.
Oh, your favorite topic Mr.
Forrester.
There is a list of other complaints dugaèak.
-It's totally crap.
Sorry.
Can I say it?
-The parking problem?
What parking problem?
Miss Templeton?
The problem with drugs?
Hells Angels?
You're kidding, right?
Miss Templeton warn you if you disturb again,
we'll throw you out of the proceedings.
Oh, Rob Haley knows to be just
a great chef and a great dad.
If it is a crime, then
we're all fucked.
There were at least 100 cars that
tried to enter the village.
You could not breathe the fumes.
Even were the buses with tourists.
-A bus!
And it was not gourmet
hodoèasnici.
It was a bunch of drunken rugby players.
-Van.
If you think about it and you'll see he's lying.
-Get out!
Kate.
Sometimes discretion is the
better part of heroism.
You think that the heroism of the couch upholstery.
-Van, Miss Templeton.
Hi. Kate.
One last thing Mr.
Forrester, if I may.
To a Hells Angel.
What type of engine was it?
Here we are at this cool,
crisp spring day.
Barely an hour from the
bustle of London.
Deep in the beautiful Arcadian splendor
of British countryside.
And we are here on
the handles boots.
Here, it must be said.
Despite the surrounding splendor
and beauty that surrounds us,
we are in a culinary desert.
Culinary desert ...
weakened by Rob Haley and his team, who
have created a true oasis of ...
poslu?ujuæi British food, èestitoga heart.
Shall I come in?
Cut!
Unbelievable.
Clearly and without hesitation.
Now it looks good to eat. -Go.
A modest selection of small,
but very carefully selected.
Warm salmon mousse with a sauce of English asparagus.
I. ..
When you're done.
-Cut! -Who let him.
Are you completely mad? -Let.
What is going on about here ...?
Do panièariti, this
is apple juice.
Guy.
If you do not mind.
We have two more meals.
Tell us what you think.
Will you?
Action!
Perfect. Beautiful texture.
Excellent combination of flavors.
Inspiring.
So we had another excellent meal
in a sociable environment.
So, again if need be proved once again
to prove that in terms of cooking ...
look like our continental cousins.
As a pupil of the eye.
As good a guide said: "It's worth
visits." Enjoy your meal.
It's a song!
Incredibly, there is God.
For God's sake, sit
down, will you!
Drank a glass.
-Not for me, thanks.
I would not have brought
him to start ispoèetka.
Two years and 127 days.
Oh, well.
Why do not you take
a bite of this.
No Cherry, I guarantee you.
Absolutely incredible.
Nice.
Hi, Alfie!
Come to the farewell beer?
-Would you mind if
I call you Bertie?
More people, more fun.
Other half baèvice.
Oh, great, mysterious
Hells Angel.
Oh, very flattering.
-Prokletstvo.-Yes. Indeed.
I came to tell you that you can re-open.
-How? Why?
Well, I suggest you shut, sit in the car and ask Kate.
-No.
Why are men so funny sometimes naive?
-Excuse me?
Who do you think came in this morning
vijeænicu for your own good,
... And said how awful small asshole
Forrester to synchronize
and save your peèenjaru?
-Are you kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.
Yes, but still she wrote that terrible criticism.
-Rob. -Minutes. -Rob!
Jesus Loz.
Give a man a drink.
-Rob! -What is it?
Do not be a damned fool.
I made you a favor.
Oh, Christ.
And despite everything she still sviða?.
Really?
So go for it, immediately!
-Where is she?
She went to the airport.
Never drive faster than 30 miles per hour.
Must-going faster than that.
No way.
Well.
Better to pick a color.
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry.
You must be joking.
Kate! Stop!
Stop!
You see, I never hit anything,
although it deserves.
Thus, it is 25 miles per hour, or this?
-All or nothing.
The damage to the car, is not it?
-Sometimes you have
to take the plunge.
Is that a fact?
I was an idiot. -Yes you were.
And you were right.
I was terribly cooked
so terrible food.
She reminded me who I was and who I should be.
I could be who I am.
Another Briton was unable
to say what osjeæajno.
Like the majority.
But you should know that everything
has changed because of you.
I wanted to tell you
before you leave.
It is very sweet.
But you could not tell me and next Wednesday.
-What?
I'm going to Paris for a week.
I do not care whether it is a week or a
day or hour, it is worth the effort.
From now on ... I drive.
Why?
I think it went pretty well.
So we had another excellent meal
in a sociable environment.
So, again if need be proved once again
to prove that in terms of cooking ...
look like our continental cousins.
As a pupil of the eye.
As good a guide said: "It's worth
visits." Enjoy your meal.
What to watch all hell!
Go back to the damn job!
