Good morning sir.
- A very good morning.
Have a nice trip, sir.
- Thank you.
It's more crowded here than
for an India vs. Pakistan match,
Our boys love sports.
Nothing like that.
When girls play volley ball,
boys stand to ogle at them.
If it's tennis, they lie down
to ogle at them.
Our boys ogle at
even ordinary girls.
But today, Shalini is playing.
Just miss.
She hasn't even basket the ball.
Why are these boys shouting?
Forget about them.
Look at those girls jumping,
passing the ball
and basketting it.
You must understand girls'
psychology from this.
What psychology?
Like basketting the ball
after dodging the opponents,
they make boys go mad,
and dump them in the end.
How do you know that!
- It comes naturally.
It was 1 1 last night.
Shalini called me
on phone and said,
my walking style is beautiful,
my talking style is beautiful,
and I'm the lone
handsome guy here.
Why isn't she praising
you in front of me?
You don't understand
girl's technique.
What technique?
Girls move around us all day.
But they'll neither talk
nor look at us.
But at night,
their love breaks out.
They don't care parents
sleeping next to them.
They go under bedspread,
and talk to us secretly.
But they only make missed calls.
We get thrilled and call them.
But seeing the phone bill
makes us swoon.
Let anything happen,
I'll express my love to
Shalini after the match.
Excuse me, Shalini.
Express your love later.
Watch, who is giving
love letter to Shalini.
Who is that goat?
Wow! Simply superb.
I don't know what to say.
I can understand.
Nice.
But I can't accept its content.
What do you know about me?
We would've met 5 times.
Smrithi introduced you to me once.
We saw each other
at the signal once.
And again in the corridor once.
That's it.
What's this?
Shalini...
- Look Avinash...
As far as I know,
falling in love after understanding
a person completely,
is long standing love.
Got it...?
What you feel at first sight
is only a fatal attraction.
You fool! Saw that...?
If I had expressed my love
to Shalini on your advice,
I would've got the same result.
Let it take a year or 10 years,
I'll understand her fully
and express my love.
Thank god! I got saved.
Before you understand her,
and express your love,
someone else is going
to overtake you.
Come my leader,
We both are one
Though you're my fan,
you're my leader.
Come my leader,
We both are one
Though you're my fan,
you're my leader.
Winning once is not a history.
Win everyday,
the world is yours.
Never bogged down...
never bend down.
Keep climbing the
ladder of success.
Shoot...
At the world.
Shoot...
At the world.
Come my leader,
We both are one
Though you're my fan,
you're my leader.
Neither become a Hitler,
nor a Lord Buddha.
Be humane,
the world will look beautiful.
Neither be a God,
nor be a beast.
Be a fan and admire everything.
The sky never publicizes
the sunrise.
Never buy awards
with money.
Nothing is impossible.
And there are no limits.
Fight hard...
Shoot...
At the world.
Shoot...
At the world
Come my leader,
We both are one
Though you're my fan,
you're my leader.
Life... this life...
Life is a book of poetry.
Read to the last page
Earth... this earth...
Live life every moment and
enjoy all the pleasures.
Create your own destiny
don't believe in luck...
Fear no hurdles,
Be ready to overcome them.
Bamboo must be burnt
to become a flute.
Shoot...
At the world.
Shoot...
At the world.
Hey you... stop.
What did you do now?
- I jumped.
You couldn't even see
a man sitting there.
But you're jumping with joy...?
Sorry, I didn't notice
you watchman.
Watchman...?
Do I look like a watchman?
So, you're not a watchman.
Then, are you a gardener...?
A cook...?
I'm a student of this college.
What are you looking at?
What's it?
- Student...?
Thank god you told me.
I thought something else too.
You're capable.
What's your name?
- Sachein.
Spinning yarns.
Your name?
- Arnold.
Your original name?
- Ayyasamy.
Did he ask you?
Now that I know your name,
forget about it.
Why are you dressed
up so differently?
Young boys dress like this only.
Young boys dress like this only.
He says he is Young...!
Teasing me!
I heard a man is studying
in this college for 9 years.
It's you, right?
- Yes, it is him.
I've a reason for that.
Our teacher struggles
very hard to teach us,
but we leave the college
after passing our exams.
I'm not so unfaithful like you.
To be faithful to our teachers,
I'm still studying in the
same class for 9 years.
It's not enough if you
respect only love.
We must also respect
our teachers also.
I'm the only person in
this college to do so.
Great explanation to
cover up your failures.
Stop jumping and teasing others.
Come, study,
pass your exams and go.
That's how you show
respect for your seniors.
Bye, Ayyasamy.
Come here...
Move.
You said you thought
something else. What is it?
No.
It's okay, tell me.
It's bad.
Bad...?
Then, say that in my ears.
If you don't tell me,
my head will break. Tell me.
I thought you're
this area's pimp.
Bye pimp.
- Pimp...!
Do I look so cheap?
Still here...?
- We know that. We'll go.
Great insult!
What's your name?
- Preethi.
Preethi.
Preethi.
Preethi.
Do you know my name?
- Ball.
Not Ball, my name is Sachein.
Friends...?
- Friends.
You smile cutely.
Thank you sweet heart.
Take it.
Bye Sachein. - Bye.
The road is blocked.
Go this way.
Go.
Come. Go this way.
What's all this?
Come...
What's happening?
We must go to office...
The road is blocked.
Go this way.
We're helpless.
Just listen to me.
What do you think of yourself?
How can we go?
Minister is coming.
Why are you torturing us?
I'll inform to sister Jayalakshmi.
They've made me go
round all the streets.
Was I brought here to see you?
Give it to me.
Look, it's Sachein.
Stop him.
Are you dreaming?
Lorry traffic is heavy here.
I saw a girl.
- I expected.
I saw her 2 beautiful eyes.
Every girl has 2 eyes.
So sweet... so nice... so cute.
He's blowing horn on
his hips talking to him.
You give me laughs.
- You never laughed.
Don't go after any sales girl.
Come to college tomorrow.
I'll show you a portrait
known as Shalini.
Then you'll shut your mouth.
Brother, I saw a beautiful girl
and I was very happy.
Why do you torture me
narrating about a junky?
Actually Sachu...
- Get lost you...
He left unfinished something.
What was that?
I know that...
What did he say? Tell me.
Clear the traffic.
Very good.
Hey Mangala, why are so dull...?
Chorus.
Don't you've sisters?
She's very eager to
meet her sister-in-law.
Your mother is also a woman.
Wants to meet her
mother-in-law too.
Get their address.
We'll take them home some day.
They've no homes.
So, they live here only.
Then, why are you in a hurry?
I'll bring them here someday,
meet them then.
We've no honour, right?
- We're are used to such things.
Sachu, are you dreaming today
also like the other day?
You were mad about a girl
seen on the street.
If you see our Shalini,
you'll be stunned.
I beg you, please leave me.
I don't want junk girls.
I'm telling about her
and you're saying no!
We won't leave
even if you say no.
Today, you're going to see her
and get stunned.
Hey Sachu...
So, you're here.
Didn't I tell you about the
college beauty Shalini?
How is she?
Very beautiful?
Shalini... College beauty...?
- Yeah!
The Shalini, college goes mad after.
- Yes.
Dream girl...! Shalini.
Don't mistake me. - I won't.
- What does she have?
What does she have?
What's that she doesn't have?
I was expecting something more.
When she smiles,
her cheeks turn red.
I accept that.
Apart from that,
nothing seems so special.
Her lips are bit cute, sweet...
I accept that.
I'll keep watching her lips all day.
But you said, the entire
college is after her.
and beauty... what beauty?
Oh, College beauty,
calling her a dream girl.
That was too much.
Don't insult me in front of her.
Listen to me.
Ayyasamy, let this be
the first and last time.
How will I...
What are you saying man?
You don't worry, my dear.
No. Don't feel bad. Just joking.
Don't mistake him.
My god! He mustn't be spared.
What do you know about me?
You think you're smart.
You think you're smart.
You really don't know about me.
You don't know about my anger.
I won't spare you tomorrow.
I hate your smile.
I hate you.
I'll prove who I'm tomorrow.
I'm not so beautiful?
But, you can keep looking
at me all the day?
A ready smile on his
face all the time.
What did you say...?
I'm just an ordinary girl... please.
Will you watch my dimple all day?
Did I ask for this?
I can't believe it.
I won't spare you.
I will...
Dad, I was shouting
all this while,
but you are keeping quiet.
Kamala...
- Yes.
Coffee is good.
Balaji, I could see you clearly
when you were at a distance.
But as you come closer to me,
you fade away. Why is it so?
Fuse gone.
- What?
Eyes.
So, that's also growing old.
What should I do now?
Eat fish.
Eating fishing...
- Is good for your eyes.
If I don't eat fish...
- It's good for fish.
You...?
- Yes brother.
Look, I've been watching you.
You're trying to ditch me
by calling me brother.
What have I done to you?
That girl looks at me
only by god's grace.
But you spoiled everything.
Are you happy now?
It was just for fun.
- You call this fun...?
Calling it fun, you've
separated 2 love birds.
Love birds...!
Are you a bird?
- Why not?
Don't talk to me hereafter.
From now on, there is nothing
between you and me.
Don't get angry.
- I'm angry.
Let me seek your forgiveness.
- No use.
Then, I'll seek her forgiveness
on your behalf.
Can I trust you?
- Sure.
You could've done this
that day itself.
Go and seek her forgiveness
in front of me. - Okay.
Come here for a second.
While seeking her forgiveness,
add some more I'll tell you now.
- What's it?
Tell her that
"Sir didn't sleep last night."
"Sir didn't brush my teeth."
"Sir didn't go to toilet
in the morning."
"And Sir is always
thinking about her."
Just because I made
a small mistake,
you're addressing me
as "SIR" continuously.
You've touched my heart, brother.
Whom did I address as "SIR"?
He addressed himself as "SIR".
Got it.
Go.
Come here.
Add some more while
telling all this to her.
Whatever you're going to say
must hold her heart tight,
just like the anchor in the sea.
Go.
Now watch...
Why is he going this way?
- Very obedient.
He's shaking it too much.
Did you see that film?
Very crowded.
So what? Do what I say?
Okay.
That's good.
Nice song.
Excuse me. I want to talk
to you for a minute. - No.
Just a minute.
What's it about?
Isn't it the outfit worn by Manisha
in the film 'Indian'.
Very nice.
- Thanks.
Very cute.
- Thank you.
Very beautiful.
- Thank you.
I meant her.
It was very fine on her.
Eating cheese burgers,
cheese pizzas for free
you're like a 5.5 feet barrel.
He asked me to tell you
"Do you need such a dress"?
Ayyasamy.
He's flattering her to the hilt.
He's waiting there.
Go...
Boss...
I'm going to make her fall for me.
Watch.
Did he tell you?
Did he tell you everything?
Hey Shalu... why are you falling
at my feet now itself?
Do that after marriage.
I'm leaving you because
it's a college.
Or else, I would've beaten
you with slippers.
Beat with slipper?
Brother...
You spoke to her only for 2 minutes.
She was about
beat me with slipper.
You told me to add more.
I added many.
Was that as strong
as the anchor?
Like today, I'll add more
for you everyday.
Bye Ayyasamy.
Everyday...?
Whatever you said today made
her raise slipper on me.
If he comes tomorrow,
he would make her kill me.
He's planning to get me
killed by a woman. - Yes.
You come tomorrow.
Let's be careful.
I've work.
Where is she?
- There she is.
What shall we have?
Just a sandwich.
It's been 2 days since I ate.
Is Rs. 50 enough?
I'll buy him food.
I didn't beg you.
You raised your slipper on me,
so I didn't eat for 2 days.
I asked him to seek forgiveness.
But you insulted me.
Really?
- Yes.
It's okay.
I was bit haste.
It's alright Shalu.
But you must do me
a favour today.
I'll buy you Idly and chutney.
You must eat.
Shit, No.
You must eat.
- No.
You must eat.
You must eat...
You must have told her also.
Make 3 juices
Start with a juice.
Wait.
Why is he here?
- I don't know brother.
Hide it.
This physique appears familiar,
is he Ayyasamy?- It's him!
Oh Our Ayyasamy!
What has brought you here?
Forget about it, when did
you join service here?
Friends! What do you say?
Get together.
- That's it! Never decide hastily!
Friends? Our Shalu baby!
Baby?
Does she appear
like a baby to you?
Hi... hi... hi...
I think you spend more time
here than in college.
Who are you man?
What do you want?
Ask him like that my dear.
Who are you? Me?
How can you forget after meeting
me once? Is it possible?
Are you an amnesia patient?
- Shut up!
If you find a group of girls
will you join them?
Get up! - Up!
Any problem Shalini?
Will you solve the problem?
That man!
- Who is that?
Why am I here then? Shut up!
Shalini, I'm Sachein.
Will you go on your own
or shall I call help?
Shut up!
All your efforts are in vain.
Ayyasami is no loser.
Why did you do like this Shalini?
What's wrong in it?
He deserves it.
Over doing things
when I'm here.
You did the right thing!
- Thank you!
Happy?
How's that?
Will I get angry if you fail to
recognise and scold me?
This hero pops up in between
saying, any problem?
Waiting for an opportunity
to barge in.
I don't care your shouts
and whispers.
I'm telling you now,
in these 2 days,
won't you've talked about me
at least in anger?
Were you talking about him?
Sister! - Sister?
You said it right sister.
It was me who told she's not
beautiful and Manisha Koirala.
Whatever said and done,
Ayyasami's words came true.
What great hep girls!
They come with tongues
out for a free soda...
and you just sipped one now.
Is this enough for today Ayyasami?
Idiot!- Sister... you?
Stupid!- Have you poured on him?
When I opened my eyes...
like god appearing before me...
She appeared before my eyes...
Like caught in a heavy downpour
without an umbrella...
You drenched me in the rain of love
Till I met you...
All my days were listless...
After meeting her all days
have become festivals...
I've got involved in
a beautiful accident...
Though there were
ways to escape...
I willingly gave it up...
I don't know your name...
I don't know your place...
A beautiful bird doesn't
need a name...
I'm looking at you without
your knowledge...
Can the moon know the
image on the river water?
I'm carrying a life
inside my life...
Is this what you call as love?
The burden on my heart...
Is it love for you?
When I opened my eyes...
like god appearing before me...
She appeared before my eyes...
If you step on the road...
Even street lights will
wink at you...
Even Sun will refuse to set...
If you bath in the river...
even fish will get fever...
Rain will rush down
to touch you...
Even an earth quake can't
break my strong heart...
When a flower struck me,
it gave in easily...
When I opened my eyes...
like god appearing before me...
She appeared before my eyes...
Like caught in a heavy downpour
without an umbrella...
You drenched me in the rain of love
Hello! What do you want?
Nothing for now, I'll inform
when I need something.
What are you doing?
Always watching me.
I'm very uncomfortable.
You watch me walking on road.
You watch me reading books.
You watch me dancing.
What's all this?
I watch you in rain,
on steps...
What's your problem?
I like so I watch.
What?
Watching you is pleasure,
so I watch you.
There's nothing wrong in
watching beautiful things.
I'll watch if there's a
beautiful cloud pattern.
I'll watch if I find
a dew drop on rose.
Your way of talking
in tension is beautiful.
When little ice cream
stuck to your nose...
You did something...
it was very cute.
You tripped and fell on
steps the other day...
you watched around
if anyone had seen it.
Everything was cute.
I love your loose hair.
Your smiling eyes
are beautiful.
Your shivering...
even your teeth are beautiful.
The cute stomach you hide with
great difficulty is also beautiful.
Boys like this only.
Hips on the side of stomach.
No need of hips!
Once is more than enough.
No... I'm saying...
Your dancing legs which
never rest are beautiful.
Can't we keep watching it always?
I feel happy.
I'll watch...
keep on watching...
Did I come and talk to you?
Did I whistle at you?
Did I make any gestures?
I'm admiring from a distance.
You can't stop me.
If you don't like, wear a veil...
Nobody will see you.
Now also you're confused
over how to scold me...
Sweet... cute...
That's Shalini!
Rascal!
- Why are you abusing me?
Not you!
How dare!
I warned him not to watch,
he insists on watching me. - Who?
Always with a ready
smile on his face.
Let him come to face me again.
I'm here.
Hi... hi... Sister?
- No, mother.
Mother... please bless me.
- What's this? God bless you son.
My father told to me seek
blessings from elders.
Moreover you're like
Madurai Meenakshi Bhavan...
No... you're like
Goddess Madurai Meenakshi.
One more thing...
When compared to you,
she's just a patch of you.
I mean... beauty!
- Son...
You're inviting me
to your home, right?
Is you insist, then
I'll definitely come.
But Uncle must be at home.
Bye Mother Meenakshi.
Do you've such good friends too?
But you never talk
a word about them.
Oh Mother! I was talking
about him till now.
Great beauty! I must trap her.
Why is she staring at me?
What do you want man?
Why are you watching me?
Go and watch your mother.
Go and watch your sister.
He's blind.
Please help me... book...
Who is that?
I'm sorry.
- Were you talking to me?
Were you using choicest epithets
for me? - I'm really sorry.
No problem, it's a routine in my life.
God gave limbs, beauty
and intelligence.
But forgot to give me vision.
Come, I'll help you in crossing.
No problem, don't worry about me.
- Mom, I'll leave him and back. - Okay.
It's warm for this chill weather.
- Come...
Taking me...
- I'll get you into a taxi...
No, leave me in
the parking area.
My father too tells me
to control my anger.
He's a fool.
My mother suggested
Yoga for me.
She too is a fool,
ask her to do Yoga.
Unlock the third bike please.
- Okay.
I'm really sorry.
- No problem.
Thank god! She's getting so
angry for watching her.
It's good that I acted
as a blind man.
Why didn't I get this
idea yesterday?
Good idea!
- Idiot!
Rascal!
Were you waiting for the
Sunday to play cricket?
If the ball comes this side,
you are finished.
Don't get angry. Anyway crowd
isn't coming, let at least ball come.
Avinash is disturbing me everyday.
Avinash? He's a bad man.
Howzzat?
- Out!
Hey! It's Sachein!
Shalini, listen to me.
You'll scold him and he'll
retort sarcastically.
No... let's go from here.
We shouldn't have
left him easily.
Hey... My bag... move...
My bag...
- Is she 'love letter' Shalini?
What's so great to fall
in love with her?
Are you creating trouble
with your brother's help?
And she rejected you.
Do you need men with
distinct qualities?
Hey...
Play carefully boys!
- Sorry... sorry...
Anyone of them is okay for you?
Shall I send all of them
together or individually?
How do you like it?
Avinash, tell him to talk decently.
What will you do if I refuse?
Shut up! This is public place.
If I raise alarm,
crowd will gather.
Super!
Crowd? Let me see if
at least one will come.
I'll touch here... touch here...
Come on shout!...
Now I'll touch here...
Is the bat hot brother?
You look like a crook...
sorry a gentleman!
Gulp down few beers and
enjoy a fling at chicks.
You are disturbing us
and others here.
What if I disturb you?
What will you do? Beat me?
Come on beat me.
Whether it is love or anger,
I'll reciprocate it 100 times...
allow me to finish it brother,
my only punch dialogue.
Oh No! I never beat
anyone before noon.
There are 2 minutes
before it strikes noon.
If possible beat me before that.
- What if we fail?
At the strike of noon,
no one will be here.
Come on... come on...
Beat it to the pulp...
- Sorry...
The world...
Beat it to the pulp...
The world...
Haste... hasty in everything.
Beat it to the pulp...
The world...
Get up man!
- Brother is calling you.
Come on... come on...
Beat it to the pulp...
The world...
Beat it to the pulp...
The world...
Sachein, super!...

Leave me.
One girl and two men.
What will you do now?
One ball two wickets.
Leave me.
Okay... okay...
What shit is this!
From grannies to aunts,
they like my car, they love me.
But Shalini treats me
like a dummy doll,
and never respects me.
Marry the girl who loves you,
not the one you love.
Then, life will be beautiful.
A proverb!
Stop shooting proverbs.
Boys first fall in love with girls
like Mumtaz, Kiran, Trisha.
No girl respects them.
Just because they are
unable to impress girls,
they marry what they get.
Such proverbs are told
by people in pain.
Don't say such things to me.
Everyone looks at the heart
and not the body.
Attention please! You guys see
only the heart and fall in love.
...Tamil Nadu would be
in a disastrous situation.
You may try many tricks,
but Shalini will not fall to it.
I've a technique to
touch even Shalini.
What is the technique?
- Sacrifice.
Sacrifice!
- Means ...
I know what Sacrifice is.
- What's your plan?
Girls will not fall in your trap
even on shedding crocodile tears.
Finally they will use the
trump card of sacrifice.
They jump from a bridge, take poison,
cut their nose, tongue,
...that's why they fall in love.
Look there. - Wait.
Wait?
Looks cute?
- Very cute.
...When I jumped in joy,
I hit sky...
When I spread my wings,
I became a bird...
What's all this?
Yesterday a problem cropped
between love or money.
My useless father said,
"Marry your sister's daughter,
I will give you Doddabetta"
I said no.
"Marry your uncle's daughter,
I will give you Mettupalayam"
I again said no.
Because I love you so much.
Very good.
- Thanks.
Not only that, my father's
property, car, money,
my mother's old jewels,
I've gave up everything.
To be frank,
I own only 2 things now.
Your love and this dirty jerkin.
Very good.
A long time doubt
is cleared today.
What doubt?
- That you are a crack.
CRACK...!
How will you look after
me without anything?
Will you make me to work?
Don't get tensed.
Am I useless to
send you to work?
I've 2 kidneys.
Selling a kidney will
fetch Rs. 50,000.
Isn't that enough for us to live?
- Not enough.
Who'll love if you
talk like an idiot?
Wastrel!
What's this?
When I told my parents,
they called me a wastrel.
When I expressed to my sweetheart,
even she's calling me a wastrel.
Are lovers wastrels?
King... I'm the king.
What's your name?
Jothilakshmi or Jayamalini?
Shalini
Father met with an accident.
What am I to do with that?
Excuse me. It's your father
who met with an accident.
Where?
Here.
I meant the place.
Place...? Alankar theatre, Coonoor.
What are you blabbering?
Alankar theatre and Coonoor
are at 2 different ends.
Look,
Calling me out in the name
of my father's accident,
and later praising my beauty,
and inviting me to park, beach...
I don't like all this stuff.
You consider yourself Revathi
of film Mouna Raagam,
and I'm asking you to come
out to praise your beauty.
Get lost.
Came to inform about your father's
accident watching a Shakeela poster.
To hell with you, your father
and sister Shakeela.
Where is mom?
What did you say?
Sachein is a good boy.
He said my father met
with an accident.
He said that with a smile.
Tomorrow, I'll show him who I'm.
Why tomorrow?
Right now...
Bike accident. Sachein,
College mate, hospital, home.
Enough.
Shit!
I don't know how to tell you...
It's alright. Say that
with your mouth.
Thanks Sachein.
Thanks a lot.
Yesterday's incident...
I didn't know that...
Sorry for talking like that.
Forgive me.
Come on Shalini.
We are at loggerhead
ever since we met.
Suddenly, if I say that your
father met with an accident,
how can you trust me?
Not only that, I confused you by
saying Alankar theatre and Coonoor.
How is he? Is he okay?
Yeah. There is pain.
But he is okay.
Did he say why he ran
into the wall?
Or did he spin yarns?
You're a nice guy.
It's for fun.
I'm just acting like a nice guy.
I'm Sachein.
- Oh! I'm Shalini.
Shalini... for whom the college
boys go crazy.
Dream girl!
Oh! Is that you?
Shut up.
You're very cute.
- Shut up.
Sweet. - Shut up.
Those teeth...
Then...
- Shut up.
Bye.
- Bye...
I don't understand no matter
how many times I read this.
Hold the book properly.
You might understand.
Ayyasamy, ask that girl to stop.
- Which girl?
Who?
Which girl...?
Where is he?
- There he is, running...
Run...
Very kiddish.
Excuse me...
Sorry, I've a very bad habit.
If I like something,
I'll tell that person.
When you were praying to god
in the street corner temple,
you were whispering your prayers.
That was nice.
The ash you applied
on your forehead...
that was also nice.
Let neither of us tell our names.
Okay bye.
He has put the anchor.
Master, can't you do it?
Sure, I can.
Turn left. Move.
Move.
Why are you breathing hard?
Imitating just like him.
I've a very bad habit.
Am I right?
- Yes.
I'm always frank.
Am I right?
- Yes.
Don't mistake me.
Am I right?
- Yes.
Shall I tell you?
- Go ahead.
You are a very very...
- Yes.
a junk girl.
When you say what's in
your heart, girls smile.
When I say that,
they are hitting me.
From where did you learn
that technique?
You'll become a hero
if you know that.
Yes.
No, let me be like this only.
I don't want to be a hero.
Let's get drenched in the rain...
Let's get ill with cold fever...
Let's get wrapped up
in a bed spread...
With cool lies,
you win over me...
Even after knowing that,
my heart still yearns
for those lies...
I want you in my home all day...
While coming to college,
you close everything.
But in your room,
dancing so sexily...
Poor boys!
It must be a dress bought
when she was a little girl.
Get out.
Out.
It is you who invited me
for lunch and dinner.
But, is this the way
to come inside?
Go out.
When did you come?
This is a perfect question.
What did you ask?
When did I come, right?
"Let's get drenched in the rain..."
I came when you shook
your waist like this.
Wow! What a dance!
Reema Sen is nothing
compared to you.
A fan's request.
I couldn't see properly because
you were facing other side.
If you could kindly turn
this side and dance...
I will watch your dance and
go with a heart full of joy.
Go.
- Please.
Just once...
- Sachein, please...
Making fun of me?
- No.
Teasing you.
Go Sachein. - Just once.
Not today, tomorrow.
- Go.
Sachein, do not tell this to
anyone in college.
Actually this thought never
struck me till this moment.
But only after you told me,
I started thinking about telling.
Wow! Let anything happen...
Let's get drenched in the rain...
Stop it... stop it...
Happy?
Very happy.
Why you do that which
shouldn't be done?
Shalini...
Okay guys... he was right.
I was wearing short skirt...
and applied face pack.
- Oh no!
Coloured my hair too.
- Shalini please...
Yeah... I know...
I was dancing sexily to
'Vaseegara' song... - Oh god!
Any problem?
What's your problem?
When we were discussing about
next week's musical meet,
Sachein suggested this song...
Oh no!
You blabbered about
face pack and...
Short skirt.
- Yes. Hair colour...
You're talking bad about him?
Sorry... sorry please...
Sorry... sorry...
Madam, excuse me...
Did anyone die?
Why are you singing a sad song?
What?
If great people die, media will
telecast such songs only.
That's why I asked you.
Teasing me?
No madam.
This is Rock.
Whatever it may be...
Song should excite people.
That is called a song.
Even a handicapped
should feel like dancing...
You dance for a Tamil song
in your house.
Outside you proudly say
I like only English songs.
Hello...
- I know all your details.
What do you know about music?
What did you ask?
This madam doesn't know about me.
Now watch...
I'll show you!
Hey come on...
you're an untouched CD.
Hey come on...
you're an untouched CD.
My eyes are dazzled
like seeing a 1000 watts bulb.
In my song...
people will blow whistles
for my song.
people will blow whistles
for my song.
No need of your unknown music.
Hear this folk song.
Definitely, this will reach people.
No new form of music
can overshadow this.
Let any Michael or Madonna come,
Tamil folk song will
never lose its charm.
Hey come on...
you're an untouched CD.
My eyes are dazzled
like seeing a 1000 watts bulb.
Wow! What a chick!
Good challenge!
Excellent dance...
Hey Peter...
have this quarter...
Look, he's eloping with
your daughter!
Hey Ram...
Excellent buddy!
You're playing day and night game.
When you are 18, no wrong
if you talk to a girl.
Don't try to climb Doddabetta hill...
Shake if it's a bottle...
Solve if it's a problem...
This is Sachein's policy.
Follow it.
Hear this folk song...
This is medicine for your sorrows.
Come rap and jazz,
our song will never
lose its verve!
Come rock music
or break dance,
our Tamil folk song won't
leave its centre stage!
Hey come on...
you're an untouched CD.
My eyes are dazzled
like seeing a 1000 watts bulb.
Hey, raise your speed!
Beat the drums!
I think it's time to
come back to normal.
Why are you showing off Das?
Don't spend your dad's
money lavishly.
Hey Somu, why are you acting smart?
You lead a true life.
Why should we show-off?
Control yourself...
You're old bun of Nair shop.
Don't be arrogant.
Do you need Pizza?
Road side eatery is
meant for you.
Hear this folk song.
A song that will take you to
unseen and unheard worlds.
Intelligent and ignorant people,
can understand this song!
Both young girls and oldies,
can enjoy this folk song.
Hey come on...
you're an untouched CD.
My eyes are dazzled
like seeing a 1000 watts bulb.
Good attempt!
Nice beat!
Well done!
Good attempt!
Nice beat!
Well done!
This is called a song!
This is called a kiss!
Did you notice?
It's like an auto having
an extra wheel.
Look, how he is showing off.
He has come!
Everyday he's coming
in different vehicles.
But unable to trap one girl.
- He is coming...
Then, he is a show off!
- He has come.
I'm a Cupid... I'm a Cupid!
Stop your speaker and
come to the matter.
Ayyasamy, why are you
asking about it?
I'm not able to come
out with this car.
Beautiful girls are
asking lift on the way.
Hey, I've a doubt.
Did you borrow this
car or stole it? - Hey...
I can't imagine you as a owner.
I can only consider
you as a mad man.
You're right.
Look, recently a boy named
Sachein joined this college.
If you see him...
He's wearing dresses inside out.
With a junk bike don't know
if he's talking normal or kidding.
Moreover, he doesn't even
have my personality.
And Shalini is always after him.
Don't know how he charmed her!
Hey, try to trap such a girl.
Or else go around
with a tamarind tree.
Well said.
Watch my show tomorrow.
Sachein will get clean
bowled in my game.
What is he saying?
It seems he is going to bowl.
Shalini, do you know the news?
What?
What is scribbled?
SACHEIN LOVES SHALINI!
Move away...
let me see what it is...
Great insult!
He is telling about Sachein.
Hey, follow her...
I never expected that
Sachein will act so silly.
It's all because of you, Shalini.
Innocently you moved
with him friendly.
Did you see its consequences now?
A person tests liquor
also before sipping it.
Before moving with a man,
shouldn't you know about him?
How dare he writes
badly about you?!
Hey, stop man...
- Am I over acting?
Yes... control yourself.
Shalini, you don't worry.
For 4 workers, cement,
brush and cleaning...
How much it will take?
- Rs.2000
Let it be Rs.20000
I'll clean the entire wall
for my Shalini's sake.
You don't worry.
At least now you know who is local
and who is gentleman here.
Hey buddy, explain her...
You moved closely thinking
him to be a gentleman.
But he has shown his
low class behaviour.
That's why they say,
"Appearances are deceptive".
Do you want us to judge
seeing their backs?
You stupid!
How dare he writes bad about Shalini?!
- Hey, control yourself!
It's working out...
let's move.
Come on... come on...
Boss, you've trapped her!
Trapped?!
Stop!
What's all this?
Bike broke down...
that's why I'm walking...
I didn't mean that.
What's all this?
SACHEIN LOVES SHALINII...
Why there are 2 'I'?
Is it numerology?
Shut up.
I thought you're a decent man.
Sachein, but you behaved very cheap.
Like road side rowdies...
teasing girls...
Hey, cool down... Relax...
What do you mean by relax?
Wait Shalini... wait...
Look, if I want to tell
you something,
I've guts to tell that on your face.
That's me!
That is Sachein!
Instead, like this on the wall...
I'm not that type!
Look Shalini, if you face any problem,
first think deeply...
Whether that person
can really do this...
and then react.
What if you shout at me?
Don't just explode.
I take things lightly...
I know you'll become
hot suddenly,
and you cool down next moment.
But some people you know
they tend to get hurt.
Once again I'm telling you,
I didn't write this.
I'm not that type!
Okay?
Did you get my point?
You just shake your head!
Shalini, may be I didn't write that.
But what is written is 100% true.
Sachein loves Shalini.
What?
Yes...
Sachein loves Shalini...
That's true.
I don't deny that.
I'm in love with you, Shalini.
Are you joking?
No. I'm serious.
Not once, but many times...
When saw you first in rain,
I loved you.
I think you were in maroon dress.
You had a frill in this place also.
Then another day...
saying "why are you always
looking at me"?
When you angrily shouted at me,
I loved you that moment.
Then another day... after seeing me
dancing for 'Vaseegara' song,
you charged on me angrily,
after knowing the truth,
you felt shy and asked pardon
in a cute manner.
I loved you that moment.
Then...
Stop it...
Stop it...
Finally, you also behaved
like an ordinary person.
What do you know about me?
How long you have been
friendly with me?
According to me,
Love sprouts after knowing
each other deeply!
What knowing deeply and
understanding each other?!
How come?
Knowing his likes and dislikes,
Will he be a good partner to me...?
Will there be any dispute...?
Will you say 'Yes' after that
and start loving him, right?
This is love.
We can't plan in love.
It just happens!
Am I buying a motor bike?
To check about petrol consumption,
and resale value?
LOVE!
Love blossomed in my heart
and that's it!
I don't want to lie that
you're my dream girl...
You too have many defects.
Your short temper...
still I like you.
I love you.
I'm sorry, Sachein.
Whatever you say...
I don't believe in
"Love at first sight."
Love blossoming in no time,
will disappear in no time!
Don't have such ideas.
What to do?
Her childish argument
makes me still root for her.
It's a manufacturing defect...
Soon, you're going
to see her love me.
Till then a break!
When I was going out,
my friend phoned me.
After that my Professor...
He bored me...
What to do?
When I left after managing him,
Bike ran out of petrol.
Slowly pushing my bike
to fill petrol...
Is it unbelievable?
I know...
Sorry... sorry...
A hug?!
A kiss?!
Thank you.
Mother scolded me...
Why dear?
I don't want mother.
She's refusing to take
her medicine.
Hello madam, God gave us
a valuable gift in mother.
You'll get well
taking tablets, right?
Only then you can
play in the rain.
And only then you can
have ice cream.
Then only you can
get fever again.
What we think with brain,
our mothers will think
with their hearts.
Only motherless
know her true value!
Go and take medicine
your mother gives, go...
Hey lean fellow,
order as you wish.
Do you want Pizza?
Or these devils?
Order anything...
Ask your owner to come
and meet me.
Why are you very happy today?
Have you bought a car?
Not at all.
Sachein who acted too smart...
he considered me as proxy.
But I paid him back like Tsunami.
Why is he confusing me a lot?
Give me...
Will you ask a share in this?
Hey, what's the matter? Tell me.
I wrote graffiti on the wall
and blamed Sachein for it.
After reading he told her
that he didn't write it.
I appreciate his bravery...
after thinking deeply he told her
what was written is true.
I went breathless for a moment...
But Shalini gave
him a fitting reply...
He won't come here again.
If he is a human,
he won't come.
He has come...
- Hi girls...
Sorry guys...
Yesterday, I saw a song on MTV.
That is called a song.
It was really good.
It's alright if you mistake me...
Yesterday after getting
insulted by her,
if I were you I would've
taken poison instead of Pizza.
As if you've won a medal
in Olympics,
How come you're so cool?!
Hey what happened now?
She said that she doesn't like
'love at first sight' like me.
That's it, right? She didn't say
that she won't fall in love.
She will fall in love.
I spent many lakhs...
crores... - You rascal...
I spent lavishly...
and coming to college in
different cars everyday.
She considers me
a cartoon figure...
But you got second hand bike from
Military canteen bartender,
How can she love you?
That is love!
No one knows when
you'll fall in love.
This brings together unknown
people to fall in love.
You just watch...
before college ends,
If she doesn't come and tell
"Sachein, I love you".
She will say.
Did I woke up a sleeping
lion unnecessarily?
Wow! 100 years for you!
Shut up Sachein...
You're going to say
only this, right?
What? Are you challenging them?
Challenge?
Are you challenging that you
will make me love you?
Oh no Shalini!
I like you Sachein.
But don't try to challenge me...
you'll fail.
Okay, now I'll also tell
you one thing...
I too had many crushes...
First time, I had a big crush
on my Malayalam Teacher.
After seeing the movie, 'Dil se',
I had it on Preiti Zinta.
I was planning so many things...
But these are all just crushes...
When I saw you for the first time...
Some thing...
how to tell you...
I can't express it, Shalini.
Even if I tell you,
you can't understand.
That is...
Yes. We've seen!
Like this...
I think we've 30 more days
to leave this college.
Before that, you'll definitely come
and express your love to me.
Who? Myself?
Sorry Sachein.
It can never happen
even after 30 years...
I have faith in my love.
You'll definitely love me.
Do you believe that you
can never love me?
Certainly.
You're lying.
It's true.
Let's see.
30 more days...
Just 30 days...
See you...
Yeah! I'm fine.
How about you?
Is it so?
Are you free now?
Hello... Hello...
Shall we meet tomorrow then?
Why people have gathered here?
Any donkey died? Move away...
Again they've started...
They are cleverly utilizing
their chances.
Look... how that fruit
is getting crushed.
He has squeezed everything
and made juice out of it.
That girl is going that side...
but he's purposely pulling her...
Shit!
Playful boy!
Did he take so much
time to save her?
Thanks.
To hell with you!
Do you know to wear a Dupatta?
-How?
Go man! Go...
Wear dupatta like this...
Instead you tie it here or there...
Style?!
You would've died, if I hadn't come.
- Sorry...
Sorry? Use your brain.
You've everything other than brain.
Hi...
Any help?
No thank you.
Sachein...
You even know my name.
Have we ever met before?
Really, don't you know me?
I think I've seen you somewhere...
But don't know the place?!
She slipped and could've gone
home catching an auto...
In the name of saving her...
you touched her all over...
you gave audience
tense moments.
Are you asking now who is she?
Yesterday on the bike...
Bike?!
- Slipped...
Slipped... Oh god!
What happened then?
Hey look at me...
even god won't spare you...
Touch heart and tell me...
Hey don't take your hand there...
Swear touching your heart.
Haven't you seen her?
She is very close to me...
can't I see him?
Don't try to escape...
Yesterday, did you see her or not?
Anyway, even while lying,
you look handsome.
Nice to meet you.
- I too feel the same.
Bye... - I'm also handsome...
- Stop it man.
They're admiring even
when you lie or say truth.
How is it possible?
That is professional secret!
So are you professional?
Shalini...
Hi... Shalini, right?
I'm...
I know. No need of introduction.
Do you love Sachein?
No... no... who told you?
Who should say?
Don't think that I'm telling
this to you suddenly.
It's the nature of women.
Even when 100's of men
look at us...
If one man doesn't look,
our heart will crave for him only.
Yes it will.
I don't know why...
the way Sachein spoke to me...
the way he ignored me...
His smile...
Cute... just cute!
- His smile is a problem.
Let it start...
Somebody told me...
that between you and Sachein...
What?
- Love...
Love?! There is nothing
between me and Sachein.
I don't love him.
- Are you sure?
Very sure.
So I can very well
love Sachein.
What bothers me if you
love Sachein or not?
Okay, in 2 days, I'll make
Sachein love me.
I will!
Will Sachein love this girl?
Will he?
Sachein, how about we
dancing together?
Sir, cool drinks?
- Two.
As you please sir.
How many of them
do I've to handle?
Look, I've been watching
you for a long time,
you're looking at me only.
Since you're looking at me,
I'll also smile at you.
Then you'll return smile at me.
Then you'll slowly propose me.
I'll also say 'Yes'...
then it'll go on...
You appear a Christian.
If your family knows,
it may become a problem.
And you'll shed tears...
I'll also get tensed then...
Unnecessary problems...
So take your own sweet time
and come to a conclusion.
Will this work out?
Will I suit you?
Mummy...
Mummy?! Married?!
That's why I'm called as mummy.
If you had told me this earlier,
I wouldn't have wasted my energy.
Excuse me...
- Who is it?
If you remove your hand,
I can go with my wife and child.
Her husband?! Carry on...
May be, if I had seen you
before him,
what you said would've happened.
Bye.
Oh god! It's enough!
Please vacate the place.
Hello...
What's it dear?
When did you come?
I was here when she said 'Mummy'...
Do you need this?
Shaluma, I shouldn't blow
my own trumpet...
but still, I'll explain you...
what to do?
Little smartness is
always a problem.
Moreover, she is married...
has a husband also...
I struggled a lot to advice her.
Yes... I was watching it.
- Did you? Okay.
Don't know why they fall for me?
Take you as an example...
Can you stay without seeing me?
I came here to tell you it's
10 days since we challenged.
I've told you... see you.
10 days! Still I have 20 days...
She doesn't know about me!
How come in the morning?
- I've to go urgently.
If it's so, go...
why are you asking me?
I want to go to a friend's
house urgently. - Carry on...
My bike is broken. I didn't get
an auto... lift please...
Oh sure! Front side or back side?
Sachein...
Just joking...
It's better you sit on pillion.
Shall we go?
Always you complain that
roads are very bad...
Look, how helpful it is to us.
Anything happened?
- It has become hot!
Oh really?
- Yes.
Frequent use of brakes,
it became very hot.
Only last week, I got it serviced,
still it became hot.
I should change the engine.
- Engine?
Engine... bike...
Till now, were you talking
about bike? - Yes. Why?
What did you think?
- One day...
See you.
If a girl decides she can
cheat anyone easily.
How is this guy?
What happened to you?
Why are you pushing
her into the well?
Okay. What about this guy?
Oh god! She is like a child.
Why are you behaving
like a sadist?
This guy?
- Don't you conscience?
Mother if you fondle me like a child,
you won't find any groom.
Who is fondling you?
Till now, I was pitying
these guys...
Do they have to suffer
marrying you? Poor guys!
Very funny!
Manju, any help...
- No.
Sachein...
Stop...
What man?
- I want to know one thing...
Are you coming purposely
when she slips,
or did she slip
knowing your presence?
It's professional secret!
See you!
Oh God! This fruit has
fallen on the floor.
Do you want me to lift you up?
What's it?
- I like it.
Is this the right time to tell this?
Oh God! My hip has sprained.
Hip? - Yes.
- Got sprained?
Sachein, can you massage it?
What is this? You too?
Oil massage, Omelette etc.,
are old fashion.
My style is different.
The thing which I'm going
to do now...
will create sensation
for 10 more years.
No touching...
only blowing...
Without knowing these techniques,
I'm staying in the same class
for the past 9 years!
Look, how he is moving the coin!
He is torturing that girl!
He has so many techniques
in his mouth!
He could've applied oil...
it would've ended in one place.
Who asked him these things?
He is blowing non-stop.
Oh God!
It's enough man!
Come and hug me.
Join me like a paste.
I'm your terrace.
Come up, man.
Hey Bombay beeda, come on...
You're my soda.
I'm getting excited
and boiling up.
You come and eat me...
When you get hiccups, kiss me.
Keep me...
Keep me, my dear.
Stick to me...
You hug me...
You join me...
You join me, my dear.
I'm gruel and you're my dry chilly.
You drink me and I'll touch you.
Let's satiate our desires.
I'm wind-instrument,
and you are drums.
Let's play with each other.
Let's perform a musical show.
Oh lover, this is a maiden's palace...
Look how big is this!
You're my song...
come on handsome.
I'm ready to take pearls with you
and came to make paper boats.
Let us take bath together...
come on dear...
Keep me...
Keep me, my dear.
Stick to me...
Come and hug me.
Join me like a paste.
I'm your terrace.
Come up, man.
Seeing fish in your eyes,
cool breeze blew in my heart.
I'm becoming a kite
and flying in the air...
On seeing you...
I'm a golden duck...
I became restless seeing you...
Don't reveal it to anyone...
you incubate me...
near your gold chain...
Tell me, is there any
place to stay in?
I'll stay there...
Come on my dear...
No more I can tolerate
your mischievous...
I'll give you some other place.
Oh lover! Let us slowly
enjoy the show...
Keep me...
Keep me, my dear.
Stick to me...
Come and hug me.
Join me like a paste.
I'm your terrace.
Come up, man.
Hey Bombay beeda, come on...
You're my soda.
I'm getting excited and boiling up.
Now tell me...
Don't you love Sachein?
Why ego in love?
Sometimes you win,
when you lose.
It's pleasure to get defeated
to our beloved ones.
I did all these just to make you
understand the love on Sachein.
Sachein is really a nice guy.
You love Sachein.
I know.
If you've ego,
you can't win in your life.
When we lose the one we love,
I know how much it pains.
You can lose anything in life,
but not Sachein... okay?
After you express your love to him,
he'll give you a pleasant smile...
You call me on phone then.
Is it that?
Is it that?
Tell me what you want to...
You're thinking why we're not able
to take on challenge, right?
It's alright... forget about it.
It's all in the game.
Before your mood changes,
tell me what you want to tell...
my dear Shalini kutty.
Sachein...
- I know it is my name.
Next...
come to the point...
Still we've 10 days, 4 hours and 20 minutes
and 15 seconds to complete challenge.
Really?
- Remember that!
Are you challenging me?
God has given you beauty
along with arrogance.
I should take you and fix you...
...with advises!
Sachein... Hey Sachu...
What is Ravi's cell phone number?
Which Ravi?
- That lunatic man, Ravi...
Phone him and ask his number.
- Okay.
I'm asking his number...
how can I phone and ask his number?
I don't know.
Okay, tell Perumal's number.
Perumal's number?
12345...?!
Do they have such numbers?
Hello...
It is engaged...
do you've only this number?
You stupid... I gave you 8 numbers...
don't you have sense?
You're teasing me a lot...
No need of his number.
I'll meet him personally.
What is the time now?
I don't know to see time...
get lost!
Don't you know to see time?
Educated, still don't
know to see time?
Tell me where small
and big needle are.
I'll calculate the time.
Both are inside the watch!
Why are you torturing me?
Why?
Why are you drinking
beer in day time?
Is it okay if it's midnight?
People are seeing you...
Is it okay if I drink in a room?
People may mistake you...
What is your problem?
Why are you getting tensed
after seeing beer?
Hold this for a minute...
What I mean to tell you is that,
it's not wrong to drink beer.
Drinking liquor on road?
You rascal...
Shit! Oh god!
Abusing an innocent.
Have it man.
Hey, how dare you abuse me?
Mother and daughter are
coming together...
If they see him with beer,
they will rip him apart.
If we stand here,
he'll include me also with him,
and get me beaten up.
Let me escape...
See you then...
Where are you going?
Why are you bothered?
You're not replying
me properly.
And do I've to tell you
where I'm going?
Talking too much!
- Hey, wait...
Greetings...
Already it's confusion whether you're
Shalini's elder or younger sister!
are you going for a walk now?
Will I keep quiet?
I'm also watching you...
you're going to canteen... there...
- Mother come here...
First you saw, right?
You could've thrown outside, right?
What I had seen?
What should I throw out?
You never talk clearly.
I and my mother
came for a walk.
Yes.
You were having beer then.
Yes I was.
Mid day, you're having beer?
Won't my mother
think bad about you?
Why should your mother feel so?
Did she feel for not giving her?
Shut up Sachein.
Look Shalini, I can't act for others.
I had beer because yesterday's
climate was good.
After seeing your mother...
throwing beer out and
munching chewing gum...
See, I don't do all this.
This is our problem.
We lead half of our
lives for others.
Bothering what others
will think about us...
Is it necessary?
At least for a day,
live for yourself.
That happiness is unique!
Look Shalini, happiness that doesn't
harm anyone isn't wrong.
Even if a small smile hurts
someone, it's wrong.
This is our problem.
We lead half of our
lives for others.
At least for a day,
live for yourself.
That happiness is unique!
Shalini, what is this?
Why have you dressed up like this?
What's lacking in this?
New way of smiling!
Anything...
- Shut up!
Did you see Sachein?
Do you mean Sachein Tendulkar?
I meant my Sachein!
Come back once again...
What did you say?
Sachein...
Before that, what did you say?
Shut up... shut up... Bye...
Pick up... pick up...
If you say 'Yes',
I'll pick up right now.
Shut up!
- Thanks a lot!
Pick up... pick up...
Madam, shall I pick up now?
Get lost... go man...
- I'll go if you insist...
Come in...
You've come.
Then why do you hesitate?
Just like that, I came here...
I thought you're not well.
Oh god...
Is that so?
Don't think that I've come
in search of you?
No way! How can I think
like that about you?
You're such a great person!
Coffee?
Tea?
Why are you laughing?
Morning at 10,
you called me 8 times.
In the afternoon,
you called me 6 times.
Why no calls after that?
Didn't you get the line?
Or didn't have money?
What?
Even after knowing that
it was my call,
near the phone...
no... holding the phone
in the hand...
Relax... relax...
I just tested what will you do if
I don't come to college a day...
Not bad... 2 phone calls...
visiting here...
I'm really happy, madam.
I'm happy.
Though you scold me whole day,
you can't stay without seeing
me for a day, right?
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I don't get mood even
to eat today...
I'll be keep on laughing
thinking about this.
By the way, what is this?
Is it a new dress?
My favourite dress.
- Wow...
Very... very... bad!
Shalini cute!
You dress beautifully, don't you?
What happened today?
You came walking in this dress!
Didn't dogs bark at you?
You've come here
to show this to me!
I didn't come here for that.
Look Shalini, I'm not at fault.
Whenever I see you...
you do something or other...
and provoke me to love you.
What can I do?
Don't laugh...
It irritates me.
What can I do?
It's all manufacturing defect...
It's congenital...
I love you.
What?
- I love you.
Shut up.
I love you...
- Shut up.
I love you.
- Shut up.
I love you dear...
- Shut up!
I love you... - Shut up!
- I love you!
Shalini, I saw Sachein
in the hospital.
What?
Dear, are you okay?
One ice cream?
Yesterday I forgot to
tell that story.
Preethi...
Your smile is cute.
I know that I'll lose my child.
But still you made her smile
till her last breath.
I can't repay you!
Sachein, thank you...
Life is uncertain...
we'll try to make others
happy as much as we can.
I'll remember Preethi's
smile for ever.
That is enough for me.
Preethi dear...
He is a fool...
I was always with you...
If he had proposed me
instead of you,
I would've worshipped
him as god!
Shalini, don't lose him.
You should be very
lucky to get Sachein.
Don't lose him.
Hey come here...
Yes boss...
Last night, we ordered
for Parotta and Paaya.
You've given dosa and chutney!
New server...
he did it unknowingly...
Sorry boss...
I'll rip out your skin!
Fresh quails are there,
I'll get it.
Bring it...
You served coffee, where are biscuits?
- Wait man.
Didn't get what you
had asked for.
Hey ask him strongly...
Do you have to blow,
if you have a horn?
I'll cut your hand.
Stop it man.
He is creating trouble parking
vehicle on the road everyday.
If we question him,
he'll tear us apart.
Unbearable people!
Pour it.
Have they started?
We can't go further...
Please wait... dear...
Sir, please check
the problem...
My daughter is having
labour pains...
We've to go quickly.
No madam, you go and ask...
Wait... I'll go and ask...
Have patience, dear...
Excuse me...
A pregnant lady is
having labour pain...
Why are you hiding the way
and creating trouble?
Sir, please give us way... please.
They will elope with someone...
and as soon as they get pregnant,
they'll travel in an auto,
since it is free.
Hello, a lady fighting
for life there...
and you're talking nonsense?!
If you cross your limits,
then you'll get pregnant.
Get lost!
Why are you staring?
Get lost!
Shit!
I don't know what to do...
Oh god!
They are not listening...
They are abusing!
She is struggling a lot...
please bear it for sometime dear.
Greetings sir.
Yes...
Are you fine?
I've seen you in the posters...
The entire Ooty is cool
because of your grace.
After going home,
ask your wife to ward-off evil.
See you boss.
Keep the bottle inside.
- Okay.
Follow me...
Hey he is taking our bag...
start the vehicle...
Traffic is cleared...
take them quickly...
Take care, madam.
Please bear it dear...
Friend...
Friend, come on... if you go
straight, there's a hospital.
Start going...
- Okay sir.
You should live long!
Hey, welcome guys!
I asked you to ward off evil,
but you're following me?!
Oh! Do you want this bag?
If I hadn't taken this bag,
traffic wouldn't have cleared,
and wouldn't have sent
pregnant lady to hospital.
It's not possible, right?
That's why...
If brother's wife faces such situation,
then what would you've done?
We wouldn't have spared him!
That's what I'm going to do now!
Hey... leave me...
Boss, you had a great fight!
Okay. What about my biscuits?
I'll bring it now.
Wow! My favourite biscuit!
Why they're not even looking at me?
Do you look handsome?
What?
It's all your fate...
I meant those girls...
May be not a good personality?!
You don't have personality.
That's it!
What if you don't
have personality?
Boss, girls of these days don't
fall for handsome guys.
They fall only for talent!
Give me an example...
Is Sachein handsome?
Sachein?
Sachein Tendulkar, boss...
Cricket player. Audience spell bound
with his batting.
Forget it.
Is A.R. Rehman handsome?
He's moving around
with long hair.
Don't everyone dance
to his music?
Similarly... expose your talent...
- If I do so?
you'll be pulled down...
- What?
I mean to say that you'll
become talk of the town.
Good...
Now I'll show my talent.
Beat the drums...
Sprightly beat the drums...
Beat the drums this way...
Beat the drums!
I'll roam around
piggy back on you.
I'll close your eyes and
play 'hide and seek' game.
Is this gait enough?
Do you want more?
What's all this?
- Movements.
What movement?
-'Ghilli'!
To me?!
I can show it only to
the right person, right?
Shall I lie down?
- Control yourself.
I danced better than him, didn't I?
He is jealousy.
Do you've white dress?
- Why?
I had a dream.
Heavy cyclone...
mist has covered roads...
leaves are flying...
you came running in
a long flowing white dress.
Smiling like this...
You came running to
express your love to me.
You searched me in
the canteen, library...
You were very eager to
express your love to me...
You were coming...
you were coming...
Suddenly you disappear...
Yes... this can happen
only in a dream.
Sachein, do you know one thing?
I'll get married after
completing my degree.
When? After 5 p.m.?
Shut up.
My dad's friend is in Canada.
In a marriage album...
in a group photo...
that too out of focus...
they saw me and liked very much
and they called my father.
Shalini, what you are saying is...
True! Soon, they're coming here.
If everything goes well,
immediately marriage.
Next, I'll go to Canada.
That's why I'm telling you...
don't have false hopes.
Shalini, what are you talking?
Sachein!
Look, you should have
talent even to lie.
How is that?!
Group photo... that too, out focus...
If you lie like this,
will I believe you?
Won't you people like
guys happy? Great!
Women know what to
tell to flatter men!
But I'm Sachein...
you can do nothing.
Within 2 days...
making you feel shy...
and making your
cheeks blush red...
coming near me...
feeling your breath on me...
on seeing me...
I love you...
If you don't say
'I love you Sachein'...
You'll say...
Season sale is on the peak.
You've good collections here, right?
Hello...
Hello uncle...
why didn't come home
or call me on phone?
Are you very busy?
Not that...
How are you?
I'm fine. Sachein, I'm not able
to bear your torture.
What did I do?
She always talks about
you in the house.
But I'll tell you one thing...
She has controlled
her anger a little bit.
Come to my house.
Shalini will soon leave us.
Where?
Didn't she tell you?
We've fixed her marriage.
We two are friends
from our childhood.
My close friend's son...
They're coming from Canada
this evening. Ask Shalini...
If she agrees, they are ready
to fix the marriage.
I was afraid she may say
"I've fallen in love".
But she accepted it.
Most probably,
if everything goes well,
we'll perform her marriage
within 15 days...
Come home... okay?
See you.
- Bye.
I was afraid she may say
"I've fallen in love".
But she accepted it.
Sachein, wait...
It seems you met my
father yesterday.
At least now you
believe my words?
Hello...
What happened?
- Do you know what is today?
Birthday?!
The day which you were
eagerly waiting for...
The day which I was
afraid to face it...
30th day!
I was over confident.
Arrogance that you
were my Shalini!
But one thing Shalini,
These 30 day memories
are enough for me.
Even if I close my
eyes for a minute,
I can see you...
I can touch you... I can...
smell you Shalini...
In these 30 days if any of my
words or jokes hurt you,
just keep in mind, Shalini.
I haven't seen my mother...
Shalini, you're the first girl
whom I admired in my life.
If you ever had a thought
that I had hurt you,
I'm sorry, Shalini.
I'm extremely sorry.
Hereafter I won't call...
I won't come...
Definitely I won't face you...
It's paining me a lot...
Like... I've...
I'm not able to give
even a false smile.
Any way, bye!
It's like I'm seeing you
for the first time.
Before that...
I'll take leave, Shalini...
I feel like...
That's all, isn't it?
Shalini, what happened?
I can't believe it!
- What happened?
Sachein came to me and
accepted his defeat.
At that time, I was about to tell
'I love you Sachein' and hug him.
You could've told him, right?
- Come on man...
He challenged me saying
I'll love him within 30 days.
As he said, I love him.
I love him.
Then you could've expressed
this to him, right?
No... no... no...
If I go and tell him now,
he'll tease me all my life.
I'll go and express tomorrow.
I'll express my love publicly.
"I love you Sachein"!
You can postpone anything
not expressing your love!
Hey just one night!
Let him cry nicely...
tomorrow morning...
I'll say loudly that...
I can't live without you...
Inside a mango groove,
you entered like a crab.
Finding no one there...
you held my hands...
You entered like a crab
inside a mango groove.
Finding no one there,
you held my hands.
You entered like a crab
inside a mango groove.
Finding no one there,
you held my hands.
What's wrong in holding your hands?
Why are you making
noise like bangles?
You've lost a beautiful chance
and you're scolding me.
You are playing on my nerves.
You are cutting my soul
and throwing it away.
Like sweat in summer,
you're dropping down my chest.
You're looking at me
opening my eye-lid.
You entered like a crab
inside a mango groove.
Finding no one there,
you held my hands.
I'm going to pack you
inside my upper cloth.
I'm going to tie my hair
with your mustache.
I'm Courtallam waterfalls...
drop down from your body...
On your mirror like body,
I'm going to play my tricks.
Oh Thirupatchi, don't hurt me
with your sickle.
Your touch can never
hurt me dear.
Mango groove...
Mango groove...
You entered like a crag
inside a mango groove.
Finding no one there,
you held my hands.
Oh green parrot! You've come
to age on seeing me...
I'll flood your lips with kisses...
come with me my dear...
Oh daring tiger...
Don't roar at me, my dear...
You want my love or anger?
Tell me, tiger!
Oh deer! I'm going to stab with
my passionate mustache.
I'm going to carry you and
paint the town red.
Mango... Mango...
You entered like a crab
inside a mango groove.
Finding no one there,
you held my hands.
What's wrong in holding your hands?
Why are you making
noise like bangles?
You've lost a beautiful chance
and you're scolding me.
You are playing on my nerves.
You cut my soul into pieces
and throwing away.
Like sweat in summer,
you're dropping down my chest.
You're looking at me
opening my eye-lid.
Sachein, I love you...
Hey, sorry... are you okay?
A boy named Sachein...
And you...?
Actually, I know that rascal
from childhood...
Are you his classmate
or college mate?
He's my son.
Father...
At least now, will you tell
me where is he?
Come uncle, I'll take you to him.
It's a familiar face, right?
Familiar...? He's Gautam.
He's one of the
richest man in India.
He earns Rs. 5 lakhs a second.
Is it true?
What about the rest?
Hello sir. I'm Prof. Ravi.
Nice meeting you.
I've heard much about you.
An Indian doing a project worth
millions in New York is great.
What has brought you here?
My son Sachein is studying here.
Is Sachein your son?
- Yes.
But he is so simple.
I can't believe this.
Anyway, nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.
Come.
Hey Sachein...
- Father...!
You both...
She brought me here...
Shalini, my close friend.
I see.
What has brought you here?
You want to know
why I'm here, right?
I've been trying to reach you
for the past 4 days,
and you never picked
up the phone.
Any problem.
- Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
- Sure.
Though parents may
live miles away,
but when their children
are in trouble,
they'll definitely know.
Nothing like that.
You want me to call you, right?
Fine, I'll make a phone call now.
Is your phone switched on?
First switch on the phone.
What's it father?
Your mother's death anniversary
is due next month.
I'll be happy if you make it.
It's a small request.
- Okay bye.
Generally girls fall for
boys with hired bicycles.
Sachein's father owns 4 hotels,
a satellite in America,
100 crore project in Oman.
My love matters will
come to an end.
Girls fall to Sachein for
no apparent reason.
Now that everyone know
he is a billionaire's son,
every girl in the campus will
express her love to him.
But Shalini is very clever.
She has trapped the right man.
Sachein...
- What is it?
Are you a billionaire's son?
You never told me.
Even if I've one friend,
he should be mine.
But not for the sake that
I'm so and so's son...
I didn't purposely hide
it from you...
What happened? Told him?
What can I tell him?
Should I tell him that love
which I never had for him,
and has suddenly
developed in me today?
If he says I developed love for him
after meeting his father...
I would rather prefer death.
Now I can feel his pain.
I deserve this punishment.
I don't think Sachein
will mistake you.
I wanted to make Sachein
cry for one night.
Now Sachein is having
a good impression about me.
I don't want to spoil it.
I'll never do that.
Sachein.
How are you Shalini?
Are you okay?
Not feeling good?
Vow of silence?
No.
Your sweet smile with your
visible teeth is missing.
I came here all the
way to see that.
Even I thought everything
would become normal.
I feel as if everything
happened just now.
Wherever I may go,
your memories haunt me.
In all these days,
any day, any minute,
any second,
didn't you love me
for a second at least?
You didn't.
Bye.
A small smile.
Bye.
The flight must have left, right?
Even now its not too late.
Even if you start now,
you can catch Sachein.
Don't cry once the flight takes off.
He's leaving me alone.
Let him go.
Listen to me.
Go and meet Sachein.
I can't... Smrithi.
If I see his face once,
I would pour all
my feelings to him.
Shalini...
- He's leaving me.
He's leaving me alone.
Is that all Sachein...
Shalini, stop crying.
- Okay...
Please.
- Yeah.
Hello.
Smrithi.
- Sachein.
Yes Sachein, tell me.
Is Shalini there?
No. Any message for her?
Nothing...
I just wanted to speak to Shalini.
If Shalini comes there
or if Shalini calls up,
ask her to talk to me once.
I want to talk to her.
Please.
At least ask her to call me up.
Excuse me sir... thank you.
Shalini...
I'm leaving Shalini.
Don't know why...
While leaving this place,
I wanted to hear your voice.
Please Shalini, say something.
Hereafter I won't disturb you Shalini.
Please say something.
It alright even if you
don't wish me goodbye,
at least say "Shut up Sachein"
and hang up the phone.
Don't keep quiet.
I want to hear your voice.
Shalini...
Shalini...
- Please Sachein.
Think anything about me.
you said your eyes were pricking.
At that moment,
I wanted to hug you tight,
and I wanted to shout
"I love you Sachein".
But I didn't shout.
My ego stopped me from losing.
Shalini...
I won't mind even if you
think cheap about me.
I don't care about that.
You came to my house
and asked me,
whether I loved you
at least for a second,
and went riding your
bike all alone.
I wanted to shout...
"Don't leave me Sachein".
Shalini.
I won't mind if you think I'm saying
this after seeing your father.
A little while ago on the phone,
you said you wanted
to hear my voice.
I wanted to shout
"Will you come back or not?"
"Please don't leave me Sachein"
I can't live... I've lost.
- Shalini...
Shalini...
Yes Sachein, I love you.
I love you Sachein.
Go.
You were ready to
leave me alone and go.
Stop smiling... stop smiling.
Manufacturing defect.
Go.
It's getting late for your flight.
Oh! Can I go?
- Go.
Will you phone me?
- I won't.
Letter.
- I won't.
Email.
- I won't.
Or at least love?
When I opened my eyes...
like god appearing before me...
She appeared before my eyes...
Walking gracefully revealing
it as love to me...
All my days were listless...
After meeting her all days
have become festivals...
I've got involved in
a beautiful accident...
Though there were ways to escape...
