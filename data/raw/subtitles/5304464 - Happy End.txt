i'm mad sick of her
she just whines all day
pisses everybody off
dad bailed years ago
he couldn't take it anymore
now she unloads it all on me
there
seems to be working
she says he stinks
that's a lie
i always clean his cage
lise came by yesterday
she said fact
your mum doesn't talk to you
she asks you something
and when you answer
she acts busy or bails
its all about her
anything else doesn't interest her
how can you put up with that??
after lise left
I tried talking to her about it
she said idk what you want
jeez its easy to quiet someone down
imma call an ambulance
she's not the dumbass knowitall anymore
Fuck!
How does it look to you?
Should I turn around?
- I've already set off.
- No.
Holy shit!
I just wanted to let you know.
Which hospital is he at?
Here. Where else?
I called Thomas in Lille,
but he's operating.
And so?
You're there?
- Where?
- The hospital!
Yes.
- So?
- So nothing.
They can't say just yet.
But it's not looking good.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Djamila.
That will be all. We'll clear up.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, ma'am, sir.
A little restraint
would be nice, darling.
What?
Mum, please.
Don't I have good reason to say it?
No.
Sorry?
No, you don't have good reason
to say that.
Where are you taking this?
I'd be grateful if you could continue
your squabbling after dinner.
Would that be possible?
Yes.
It's not squabbling. I'm worried.
Sorry to be so wound up.
I apologise. You know what I meant.
Yes, I know, Mum.
This morning,
I went into Paul's bedroom.
He was already awake.
He looked at me, with a grin.
And he said, Daddy!
Isn't that adorable?
His second word.
Thomas will be thrilled.
Ages ago, when we went to Kenya.
It was maybe five or six years ago.
Why?
Did you take antimalarial medication?
I don't remember, why?
Our tests not only confirm
an overdose of antidepressants,
but also poisoning
by medication of that type.
It's available by prescription only.
Do you know
if she had some left at home?
Eve, did Mummy
keep stuff like that at home?
I don't know.
Ready.
Would you like anything else?
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Ready.
Do you want to sit with us?
No, thanks.
Come on, I'll show you.
Wait!
Goodnight, sleep well.
You'll see, everything will be fine.
Don't worry about a thing.
Goodnight.
Come in.
Put your bag down there.
Make yourself at home.
Sorry, it's a bit makeshift,
but we'll work it out.
It's OK, Dad.
Well then... I'll be going.
Try to sleep.
If you need us, we're just here.
Yes.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
You want the light off?
Where's the marmalade?
Morning, Rachid.
Morning, ma'am.
In case you didn't notice,
visitors arrived last night.
My brother's daughter by his ex-wife
will move in with us.
Ask Djamila to help Anaïs
make up the yellow room for her.
Of course, ma'am, I'll tell her
as soon as I get back.
Thank you.
And make sure the dog
gets to know the girl.
He's never seen her before.
Leave it to me, ma'am.
Thanks.
Come in!
Good morning, sir!
Morning, Rachid.
- Thank you.
- How are you, sir?
Couldn't be better.
Thank you.
Have you heard, sir?
About what?
This area is for storage only.
No work is done here.
- Why'd they come up here?
- To get something.
How many of them?
Four, as far as I know.
- So work's done here.
- Once again, it's a storage area.
Like any storage area,
people fetch stuff here.
How come the toilets are here?
Believe it or not, they're in storage.
It happens, right?
- Stop it, Pierre.
- What?
Why the questions?
Even in closed storage areas,
people need to work now and then.
So they're secured,
especially next to a hole like that.
It was secured, and the gate locked.
They unlocked it to fetch some gear.
Nobody could have anticipated
the collapse.
Nor that the idiot would use toilets
that were just stored here.
How would he know?
Because it's a storage area, dammit.
Any moron knows that!
Pierre, please.
Mr Van Thamen, our apologies.
My son is very shaken up
by this incident.
Clearly, it's a series
of unfortunate coincidences.
Of course, ma'am.
A collapse like that isn't caused
by a guy peeing in the wrong toilet.
There was no earthquake yesterday,
so there must be another reason.
That's exactly what we're checking out.
The area has mostly been cleared,
and the anchors inspected.
If you're insinuating
we were negligent, prove it!
I'm insinuating nothing,
just doing my job.
Until it all checks out,
work cannot resume.
We're doing exactly that.
Stroke of luck
the others stayed by the truck.
How's the guy doing?
I was at the hospital. He's conscious.
We'll know more this afternoon.
All this is so regrettable.
What more can I say?
Yes. It's dreadful.
You can be sure
we do everything by the book.
Of course, ma'am. I imagine so.
- We'll wait for the final report.
- Of course.
Until then, don't let anyone
access this area.
- Was that necessary?
- What?
Your behaviour.
Eve!
It was on my way.
I thought, your first day,
it'd be good to pick you up.
You're not at the hospital?
Only till 4.
Is it a problem?
No.
How did it go?
Not too tough?
The other kids are OK?
I don't know.
I can't say. Nice, I guess.
Sorry.
Eve?
Eve, honey...
Sweetheart.
I'm sorry.
It's over, it's OK.
Sorry.
I so wish I could help.
It's OK.
Really?
I'm not used
to having a daughter anymore.
I'm terribly clumsy.
Forgive me.
Can we go?
How old are you?
Thirteen.
I thought you were younger.
Eve will be thirteen
in two months. Right?
Yes.
- Why do you ask?
- I'm interested.
You've already been here?
- Here, in Calais?
- Yes.
We came on a visit here
when I was still in Arles.
You were too young, you were three.
Remember?
No.
Strange.
What's strange?
Her being here now.
Daddy!
Are you going to stay?
Dad!
Her mother's in hospital.
I told you twice.
Serious poisoning.
Eve will stay here
until she gets better.
I'm sorry.
I'm losing my marbles, I know.
So you won't be staying with us?
I've got it now.
All the same, welcome to the club.
I want you to destroy me,
your china doll,
to corrupt me,
to take me in my arse
and fuck me
until my whole body
is soaked in sweat
when it feels like you're dying,
you know,
except you don't die
your hand in mine
I want you to piss smiling on my face
I so love your smile
or maybe it would be me
doing all those things to you
or maybe
both of us at the same time.
Get the address and go.
It's important.
If we seem unconcerned,
they'll double down.
We have a terrible hand.
You dropped us in it.
Be so kind as to deal with it.
No, I called Maître Barin.
You can't rely on that.
I discussed it with the insurance.
Yes!
What is it?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Mr Georges is missing.
What do you mean?
When I took his breakfast up,
he wasn't there.
Wasn't there?
Maybe he's in the garden.
I've looked all over. He's nowhere.
Sorry, I'll call you back.
He can't have just vanished.
You asked Thomas?
Mr Thomas left very early for Lille.
Madame Anaïs is still sleeping.
Miss Eve likewise.
- You checked in their apartment?
- Of course, ma'am.
Hold on.
And your flat?
Yes, this is Anne Laurent.
Can I talk to my brother?
When will he be done?
Ask him to call me urgently.
Yes, thank you.
Did you check if his stick's upstairs?
Check out the hair. Horrible!
And it gets worse.
From 2011. Nasty!
Check out this child
gazing at infinite horizons.
And beyond!
Contemplating his future.
Looking like an arse!
No, who's that idiot?
Check out the Mohican.
A cockerel!
The joke from the year 2000...
Check out that look.
Creepy. Watch out!
Check out the awesome hip-hop move.
If you can call that hip-hop.
It was the only move I could do.
It's still my only move.
I thought
I was mad cool with my...
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.
How come you're still up?
I was waiting.
Has Dad called?
They're already in Calais.
They'll be here any minute.
Well?
Apparently, it's less serious
than we thought.
Which means?
I don't know.
Thomas didn't say much.
That must be him.
Anaïs?
Hi, darling.
- Hello.
- Hello, Dad.
Well then?
Like I said, not too serious,
but it could've been fatal.
I need to eat.
I haven't eaten all day.
He rammed into a tree.
The police think it was deliberate.
There were no brake marks.
You believe that?
I don't know.
Anne also thinks it was deliberate.
BUt Why?
Remember his Swiss escapade
in December?
What are his injuries?
Could you talk to him?
No, no.
He has a broken ankle.
Fractured tibia and fibula.
His shoulder's only bruised,
but two broken ribs are pretty painful.
They put him on painkillers.
What a mess!
Anne is beside herself.
I should go down and see her?
No, she said she'd take two Halcions
and go to bed.
Me too.
I have an early start tomorrow.
Where is he? Your department?
The emergency room.
The accident happened near Lille.
OK, sweetheart?
All this isn't too upsetting?
No, it's fine.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
Must be hard.
First your mother, now this.
Let's get to bed.
You're up early tomorrow.
Go ahead. I won't be long.
- Goodnight.
- Night, Dad.
Whatever happens,
even if you forget me one day,
I am YOURS forever.
I can't see clearly,
everything is full of tears, my darling.
I'm thirsty for your tears
and I don't want you to cry.
I want to see you piss in pain
so that I can console you.
I want to hurt you
because I can't be in you,
totally in you.
Don't conceal from me
any of your darkest sexual desires.
Use me.
A gift,
it must be used completely.
I'll use it, I promise.
I promise!!
Good, my love.
That's good.
THOMAS!!!
In your arms I spent
the three most beautiful days
given to me in my whole life.
I swear
in your hands
in your smell
in this insane desire
I am cleansed of my anxieties
and I am, at last,
nothing more
than skin flesh blood and bones.
Lucky to love you.
Lucky to give you
my heart, my arse and my soul.
Lucky to be alive.
Last night...
Are you all right? Can I help?
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
Yes. Thank you.
i was 5 when my brother died
pneumonia
he was 2 years older than me
it was horrible
i loved him a lot
i totally missed him
this could replace him
another brother
this time I'm the oldest
that's so cool
He grabbed her jacket and bolted.
She didn't fight back?
She told Mr Hougron,
who called in his parents.
He did?
Then what?
I heard they were super embarrassed.
Sure, he returned the jacket
but it still sucks.
Rough place you're at.
Yeah.
What do you want?
Don't know.
An ice cream.
Hello? Just a moment.
The hospital.
They're helpless without me.
Get whatever you want and a...
A lemon stick for Anaïs, if you have that,
and maybe some Evian.
That's four euros, please.
Makes five. Have a great day!
Hello.
Hello. One lemon stick.
And an orange ice, please.
And a bottle of Evian.
- I'm out of Evian. Badoit?
- Yes.
Here you are.
3.70, please.
Thank you.
That makes four.
And five.
Thank you, young lady.
Can we get a Magnum and...
- A Cornetto, right?
- Yes.
A Cornetto and Magnum?
Goodbye.
Here you go.
Five euros, please.
Sweetheart!
Sorry.
You got everything?
Yes. He was out of Evian,
so I got Badoit.
Perfect.
Daddy?
Do you love Anaïs?
Of course, I love Anaïs.
She's my wife.
Mummy was your wife, too.
True.
You're a smart cookie.
Why ask me that?
Of course, I love Anaïs.
Just wondering.
- And why?
- No reason.
You know how I met Anaïs?
Yes?
No.
No.
Jesus!
Stop it.
Well now...
I don't know what to say.
So say nothing.
You can't disappear like that.
Can't I?
Let me see you.
It could only happen to you.
Thanks, you're too kind.
I mean, it's great you went.
Who knew
that nutcase was skulking there?
Mum, please.
Why'd you run away like that?
Rather than go straight to the police.
It could have helped
if we want them to settle.
And why disappear from the site?
You're ashamed of a black eye?
You can't just take off like that.
As you see, I can.
So what happens now, if I may ask?
You have considerable credit, Pierrot.
You're my son, and the future boss.
But nothing's set in stone,
so if you don't mind,
just knuckle down.
Your extravagances and this accident
don't help me in my efforts
to save the company.
You do get that, right?
Can't you just stop, Mum?
Please.
What's going on?
When did you start drinking?
I never even noticed.
I don't drink.
What should I do?
Can't I help you?
You're overworked? On edge?
You need a doctor?
How should I know?
Since you left home, I can't keep up.
You have a girlfriend?
A broken heart?
Talk to me.
What do you do at night after work?
You're not talking to me?
I'm going to bed.
You're going to bed?
What else can I do honestly?
What do you do?
I work.
Pierrot!
Let me help you, my darling.
My love!
Mum!
I'm no use.
What?
I'm no use.
What is this nonsense?
You think so yourself.
Drop the act, will you?
You know I'll never take over
the stupid firm.
What else will you do?
Nothing.
Why should I do anything?
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Sulking like a schoolkid
who got bopped on the nose!
What is all this?
There, she's back,
my little Mummy darling.
Why don't you go home
and get back to work?
You're a hopeless case.
You said it, Mum.
Hello. Thomas Laurent.
My ex-wife Nathalie was admitted today.
I brought her daughter to see her.
- Outside visiting hours?
- I called ahead to make an exception.
I'm Chief Surgeon at Lille.
She hasn't seen her mum for weeks.
Who did you speak to?
Doctor...
I don't remember her name.
You'll find her.
Florence, at reception. I have Mr...
Dr Laurent.
Dr Laurent,
to see the patient who just arrived.
He asked a doctor for permission to visit,
but can't remember who.
Come on, Dad, let's go.
He's with the patient's daughter.
Yes.
OK, bye.
- You can go up.
- Thanks.
- Room 223, second floor.
- Thank you.
Come on.
Hello, I'm looking for Room 223, please.
- Down the corridor, on the right.
- Thank you.
Bathroom on the left.
Guest bedroom.
- Due south, right?
- Yes.
I'll lead the way.
Sweetie, can you stop a second?
My daughter's room, and Eve.
- Hi, Eve.
- Hello.
- Pretty room you have.
- Yes.
Very bright.
- You were happy here?
- Yes.
You're sad to be leaving?
Yes.
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.
8th grade next year, right?
After her mum died,
she moved to Calais with me,
and goes to school there.
Moving on?
Yes.
Bye, Eve.
A pleasure meeting you.
Goodbye.
I'll lead again?
Master bedroom.
Toilet.
And this was my office.
We can take these stairs down.
In fact, it's two houses joined together.
That explains the two staircases.
Do you have the plans?
Buyers always want to see them.
And photos.
Tricky, after so long away.
A friend might have them.
- How many square metres?
- Around 200.
You can go, Rachid.
That's all, thank you.
As you wish, sir.
If you need me, please ring.
Of course.
Now he's offended.
He shaves me daily
and hates another person
laying hands on me.
I'm hardly touching you, sir.
How are you?
Still plying my trade.
Your trade?
What does that involve, your trade?
As you well know, sir,
I cut hair.
I cut a lot of people's hair.
I cut Mr Delamare's hair.
I cut Mr Franck's hair.
Don't be annoying, Marcel.
Yes, sir.
I apologise.
What do you make per month?
One doesn't ask things like that, sir.
You don't need money?
- Everybody does.
- Precisely.
Well?
I don't follow you, sir.
How long have you been coming here?
Over ten years.
More like twenty.
You should learn to count.
I may be soft in the head,
but I know that.
I'm not such an old girl.
You can do me a favour.
Yes?
I'll pay you well.
Yes?
Stop this faffing around!
Sorry.
I'm stuck here.
I drove into a tree,
and I was too dumb to do it right.
I heard it was an accident.
It's not the done thing.
My son's an idiot.
I asked him.
For a doctor, it's a piece of cake.
But he's pigheaded.
Last year, I went to Zurich.
They turned me away.
Apparently, I'm too healthy.
Now I'm captive in this damn chair.
You understand?
With no hope of escape.
If you obtain for me a pistol
and ammunition,
I'll make it worth your while.
But sir...
A shotgun or medication
in sufficient quantities will also do.
I have money here.
I can make you rich.
Rich enough, at least, not to have to
cut the hair of elderly idiots.
Well?
Sir...
I don't know what to say.
How can I obtain that?
I know nobody.
- I'd be a prime suspect.
- God!
Why do you want to do that?
You've caught me quite off guard.
What would you do in my shoes?
I don't know,
but you're in good health.
Are you really so naive?
Or are you just scared?
Of course I'm scared.
How could I do a thing like that?
No, I can't do it.
No, really.
Don't wet yourself.
Marcelino.
Forget it.
It was silly of me to ask you.
I can't.
Keep going.
My dear friends,
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of our family
for accepting, at such short notice
and in such numbers,
our invitation to celebrate
Daddy's 85th birthday with us.
The last few weeks,
as many of you will know,
have been agitated,
but we're all delighted
that our birthday boy
is already so much better,
and confident he'll make a full recovery.
For, as you often say,
you can't keep a good weed down.
That's not all we have to celebrate.
Unbeknown to most of you,
after the birth of little Paul last year,
our family has grown again,
and this time quite unexpectedly.
Eve, Thomas's daughter
from his first marriage,
will from now on
be a part of our life.
Eve, we are very happy
to have you here with us.
I don't wish
to monopolise your attention.
Miss, my heartfelt thanks
for your sublime performance
that enchanted Daddy.
After spiritual pleasures,
I won't deprive you of worldlier ones.
The weather gods are smiling.
The air in the garden is exquisite,
to order for Daddy's birthday.
The champagne and buffet await.
I wish you all a wonderful evening!
How about we plunder the buffet,
little cuz?
If you want.
Aren't you hungry?
Come on.
What do you like?
I'll find something.
How old are you?
Thirteen.
Right.
Excuse me,
see what appeals
while I get a drink.
Look who it is!
What a great surprise!
Djamila and her rice tagine!
Whatever you do, taste this.
It's delicious!
Djamila is our Moroccan slave.
A real gem.
She's a godsend.
She cooks like Alain Ducasse.
We're so lucky
to have her working for us.
Bravo, Djamila!
Come along, will you?
I'd like you
to wish Grandpa happy birthday.
Come on.
Dad, sorry to interrupt.
Eve has something to tell you.
Yes?
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Don't I get a birthday kiss?
Who are you then, my dear?
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to thank you all
for coming today.
First, let me once more express
my clients' sympathy
with regard to the unfortunate accident.
As you know,
the Health & Safety investigation,
ordered immediately afterwards,
brought to light no indication
of malpractice or culpability
of the company Laurent.
We may assume therefore
that the Prosecutor
will abandon the criminal proceedings
opened as a matter of course.
Furthermore, to my mind,
no civil liability
can be attached to my clients.
But Mr and Mrs Laurent
are perfectly aware,
besides all other tragic aspects
of this accident,
of the financial difficulties
that this engenders for your family,
particularly with regard
to dependent minors
who will remain
a long-term responsibility.
In theory, you could attempt
to assert in court
your putative right to compensation
on the basis of civil liability.
Although, as previously stated,
I see no legal grounds
for such a claim.
Nonetheless, our clients
wish to offer their support
in this difficult situation,
in the form
of a payment of 35,000 euros,
to alleviate your financial difficulties.
I stress,
they are under no obligation.
You don't have to decide now
whether or not you accept this offer,
thereby avoiding legal proceedings.
Discuss it with a lawyer of your choice,
and notify me of your position.
As for the incident outside your home,
to which a witness has been traced,
Mrs Delorme,
a resident of the same building,
the Prosecutor remains
unaware of it so far.
It's within your power
for him not to know.
And for there to be
no claim for damages.
You follow me?
I don't know.
Why didn't you tell us?
- What?
- What do you mean, "What"?
That you're unhappy.
You miss your mother, you're lonely.
How should I know?
We can't be inside your head.
So?
So what?
You're so far off.
I love you a lot.
You have to believe me.
Maybe I'm clumsy, but I love you.
You'll take me with you
if you leave Anaïs?
- What?
- You'll take me?
What's this nonsense?
Why would I leave Anaïs?
I have four years till I come of age.
I'm not going in a home.
Where did you get that?
Why'd you go in a home?
What, OK?
Are you crazy?
I love you.
Nobody's putting you in a home.
Where'd you get that idea?
Will you take me with you
if you leave Anaïs?
I won't take you anywhere
because I won't leave Anaïs, OK?
Can we talk sensibly now?
I heard you on the phone,
at the beach.
And I read everything.
- What?
- I read your messages.
What messages?
Dad, please.
Drop the act.
I know you love no one.
You didn't love Mum.
You don't love Anaïs.
You don't love this Claire.
You don't love me.
It's no big deal.
I just won't go in a home.
Why'd you take Mum's pills?
There were enough left.
So you kept the rest, just in case?
Yes.
Darling, something terrible
has happened.
My daughter snooped in my laptop
and found our messages.
She made a suicide attempt.
Thankfully, it failed.
I had to delete all our messages
and from now on, I can't keep anything.
I've no idea
what she'll get into her head next.
We need to agree on times...
Dad said you wanted to see me.
No.
No, actually.
Some cheese?
No, thank you.
It's not bad.
I don't like cheese.
Well then...
Make up your mind. In or out?
Or you'll just stand there?
Shut the door, princess.
Sit yourself down.
Are you scared?
No.
So come here.
Come on now.
Fine.
Your father tells fibs.
I didn't want to see you.
He asked me to see you.
He says you don't trust him.
He's worried.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
Let me tell you a story.
Stand there or sit down,
it's up to you.
You never met your grandmother.
The time you came here, you were tiny.
You don't remember her.
Do you?
Wait.
Come here.
Come on.
Look.
A beautiful woman.
No?
When you came here, she was ill.
You never saw her.
She was paralysed, bedridden.
She couldn't speak.
I looked after her.
I handed the firm over to your aunt,
so I'd have the time.
Finally,
after three years of suffering...
repugnant...
absurd...
I suffocated her.
It was the right decision.
I don't regret it for a moment.
That's the story I wanted to tell you.
Will you tell me your story?
What story?
Why you took those pills?
You think I'm too stupid to understand?
Sit down then.
Once I tried poisoning a girl
in my class.
And?
I mean...
Not really poison her.
Mum sent me to a summer camp
when Dad disappeared.
They gave me Lexomil to keep me calm.
I was to take half a pill a day.
I didn't want to.
There was a girl I didn't like.
Every day I put my pill in her food.
It was funny to see her
getting calmer and calmer.
One day, she collapsed.
They ran tests and it all came out.
And then?
What happened?
Nothing.
I had to leave the camp.
And go back home?
Yes.
And?
Did you regret it?
Not much.
Yes.
Yes, I regretted it.
Later.
I didn't like the girl,
but it wasn't her fault.
The other day,
looking out at the garden,
I happened to see
some kind of bird of prey
tear apart a little bird.
It snagged the bird in mid-air,
shook it around and around...
Then tore it apart
on the ground with its beak.
Tore it to shreds.
Feathers flew
and fluttered back down.
It looked like it had snowed.
Then a car went by
and the bird of prey flew away.
Besides the feathers,
not much was left of the victim.
As far as I could see, at least.
It's odd. On TV,
things like that seem...
normal.
Nature in action.
But when you see it in real life,
your hands shake.
Why did you do it?
What?
The pills.
I don't know.
I don't know.
And there?
Does it hurt there?
He just nipped her.
How can you say that?
He bit her!
She ran away in tears.
They were playing, chasing each other,
and he nipped her.
It's nothing serious.
You should've been more careful.
Is it serious?
No, it's fine.
You're a brave little girl.
Now, don't worry.
I'll give your mummy some ointment.
She'll rub it in,
and tomorrow you won't feel it.
Well, it's not serious but...
Keep an eye on the mutt.
His job's not to bite us!
You have some paper?
I'll write up a prescription.
What's wrong with her?
Nothing much, just shock.
Here, for you.
Thank you.
Let me see.
Doesn't look too bad.
No?
Here, look.
Every time it stings,
eat a chocolate.
Then it won't hurt anymore.
All right?
Get some sleep now.
It's late.
Tomorrow will be another beautiful day.
Thank you.
I'm glad it's nothing serious.
I panicked when Anaïs called.
Yes, it was awful.
She cried her eyes out.
Rachid, keep the dog under control,
- or we...
- I told him.
This is the ointment.
Apply gently tomorrow
to prevent inflammation.
- I'm coming.
- What if she develops sepsis?
There's no risk of that.
Don't worry.
My warmest congratulations, ma'am,
if I may say so.
What for?
Madame Anaïs told me.
What did she tell you?
The engagement?
That's very kind.
- Won't we, Selin?
- All done?
Yes.
Twice a day, morning and night.
I'll call in tomorrow.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Ma'am?
- Yes?
You plan to move away?
Whatever makes you think that?
Ah! There you are.
I have to go into town.
I was wondering
if you could look after Paul.
What are you doing in Thomas's office?
Nothing, just...
My laptop crashed and won't reboot.
I wanted to find a workaround on Dad's.
But it didn't work.
He's changed the password.
- What?
- Nothing, it's too complicated.
Well, ask him when he gets home.
You'll stay here?
I won't be long.
In any case, he's sleeping.
I'll sit with him in his room,
no worries.
Thank you.
Do you need anything?
From the supermarket maybe?
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Ma'am, would you like us
to serve the main course now?
Or you'd rather a little break?
Good question.
Carry on. In this heat,
people don't want to sit forever.
As you wish.
All right, Daddy?
You feel well?
I feel just fine.
Perfectly fine.
Sorry to bother you...
We're leaving straight after lunch,
so I thought I'd ask now...
- What about?
- Can I borrow your babysitter tomorrow?
Mine's gone back home for two weeks
and the backup has a cold.
You know how it is.
There should be no problem.
Tomorrow's...
Hang on.
Yes, it's fine, but only tomorrow.
The day after...
Sorry, Mummy.
Apologies for my late arrival.
But I had to dress up
for such a special occasion.
I hope I'm presentable enough for you.
I'm sure your speeches were remarkable.
- I sincerely regret missing out on them.
- Pierre!
To make amends
for my indisputable blunder,
and give you a special treat...
I brought along a few extra guests
who'll be delighted to partake
in this celebration of your engagement.
Forgive me, ladies and gentlemen...
It's cool, Thomas, no need to get up.
If I can have your attention a moment.
Before the main course is served,
it'll all be over.
It won't take long.
I'd just like to introduce my friends.
- What are you doing?
- Don't interfere!
This is Mohammed,
all the way from Nigeria.
His wife and two children...
Can you take me out?
...were burned alive by Boko Haram.
- Sweetie?
- It took him a year to get here.
Every day for months, he's walked
from the jungle to the Tunnel
in the hope of getting across at last.
No luck so far,
but where there's life there's hope.
This is Yousuf.
If I've got this right, he...
Hello, Mummy.
Sorry, but what else could I do?
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm sorry you had to...
You had to witness this dreadful scene.
My son has problems,
he's receiving treatment.
Don't hold it against him, that's all.
But my son is a good person.
I am really...
profoundly sorry.
Please, take your seats.
In the name of our friendship,
I'd ask you to please sit.
Down there.
Further.
You can go now.
