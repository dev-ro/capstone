The falcon is a
one-of-a-kind hunter.
When it flies by before yur eyes
Like that.
You don't see it, but you hear it.
This son of a bitch...,
it's designed like a missile.
It's got a round head, doesn't it?
and it has modified nostrils
because, at the speeds it reaches,
when the air enters suddenly
it could explode it from the inside.
When it's hunting
the falcon goes up 400 meters
and when it's up there
it sees its prey
it folds up its wings
Like that.
At more than 300 kilometers an hour
and when it's at the right altitude
Look,
see this claw here,
This one, shaped like a hook,
...when it reaches the right height,
it goes...
And it's ready.
But the most important thing
for the falcon...
are its eyes. It couldn't hunt without
its powerful vision.
Ha, it was shat on.
You'll see it now.
What are you waiting for?
Send it up.
I need to clean its eyes, sir.
Let him go, now.
It's going to escape.
It won't get away, sir.
Look, look!
Yeah!
¡Aaaah!
Where could I see more
of your paintings?
At my house.
Can I see your house?
Ha, ha...
My name is Justine.
I'm Ana.
This is my dad.
Hi.
Hi.
He's German.
My God!
You're natives.
Can I?
Ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha...
Ana, are you in school?
Yeah.
Aside from your life.
Have you gone to school?
I have taught her
everything that I know.
... and more... Everything
that I've learned
...for her.
Not for me...
Mathematics, literature,
philosophy...
...history.
I can't handle history.
It's too tough for me.
But history is what unites us.
Each one of us is also a history.
We carry it inside, in the
deepest part of our memory.
Yes, I like history.
To know. And also to protect
myself from it.
The history of man is a chain
of atrocities...
...cruelty, and injustice.
I often feel ashamed of the human race.
Nobody is totally innocent.
But here we feel less guilty.
We don't hurt anybody.
Yeah, this cave protects you.
In today's world, living like this
is a poetic act.
Ha! We're not putting on
a show for anybody.
Of course.
Ana...
...I want to propose something to you...
I'd like to invite you to live at my
residency in Madrid...
...for the next 2 or 3 years.
There are other exceptional
young people there...
...that I have chosen personally.
I'm a patron.
You don't have to worry about
anything...
My residency will cover the
cost of living...
...and materials.
It's just like I dreamed it.
Almost exactly
Almost too much the same,
almost the same woman
But in my dream,
you ended up falling into the sea.
By yourself,
I didn't push you.
You're a brute of a father.
A total pain in the ass.
My father in the caves.
You're a total monster...
...of a father.
I'll write you.
Dear "Pain in the Ass".
Here in Madrid, I look like a native
gone off the reservation.
Well, yes, I get a lot of looks.
I'm laughing.
You know how.
I'm not afraid.
Of anything.
I feel free, and I like that.
But I still feel your hands,
holding me tight.
And I like that.
Thank you, my monster.
Justine's residency is like a
deserted palace.
And we look like a bunch
of squatters.
There's nobody watching
over us in the house...
...not even Justine...
...who lives in a house outside
of Madrid.
Every morning we have classes...
painting, music,...
...video. Everybody does whatever
he has chosen.
But they're obligatory.
If we're absent, they throw us out.
The guys are a drag.
A bunch of walking pricks.
They're only motivated by sex. Deep
down, they're all rapists.
Some of them control themselves a bit.
But that invasive instict is with them
until they die.
And we girls, what are we?
Us?
Well, a bunch of whores.
Come on.
See?
We're always trying to get them horny.
Turn them on, always from a distance.
And then we pick.
We're just selfish whores.
Us whores and them rapists.
Forever.
And them, what are they
They rape each other,
but they're whores like us.
And the ones who charge money?
The ones who charge?
They're the working whores.
And you, are you a dyke?
No, but I'd love to be.
You're the one from Ibiza?
Yeah, I'm Ana.
I'm Linda.
My favorite eye.
Because what I see with these eyes...
There's so much tyrrany in the world
that sometimes I hate living.
But that world is mysterious.
And there, not even God controls me.
I barely do.
You know something, Linda?
Your name fits you better and better
as time passes.
Whatever, nothing really fits me.
It's just that my name isn't mine.
Oh no?
Whose is it?
My father's boat's,
"El Linda".
You have the name of your father's boat?
The boat's not called that anymore.
He was a loner sailor. He fell in love
with my mother, 15 years...
...younger than him. He sold the boat
and bought a flat.
And when you were born, he
named you after his boat, Linda?
That sounds good, doesn't it?
On the outside. But inside, it's
total shit.
My father is an egoist.
He doesn't know how to love anybody.
And my old lady is
gullible and will believe anything.
Every day she becomes smaller.
She's about to disappear.
One day the wind will carry her away.
My mother left us when I was little.
I haven't seen her since.
That sucks.
And the boat?
Was it a sailboat?
Yeah.
Well, that's good.
But I'm from land, girl. Solid land.
I need to be careful...
...and catch myself every once
in a while.
You're very pretty.
Ana, daughter of Klaus...
...he's quite a man,
a monster.
Like you've never seen.
My dear monster.
Here I am open to collaboration
in everyting.
I'm liking performance art more and
more. It's impermanent.
Sir, how long will death prevail?
As long as women keep having kids...
until the two sexes become as one...
...the male like the female.
Neither male nor female.
God's adversary will move forward.
And you? Aren't you maybe a
real man?
I came to destroy the work
of the female.
You came to destroy my work?
You, female are lust.
You are what delays the
arrival of perfection.
That's a sexist thing to say.
Well, I'm the son of a god, but not
a goddess.
We jews turned our goddesses
into witches.
And since then, the heavens
have been a patriarchy.
I thought you were a socialist.
That too. The rich can't enter the
Kingdom of Heaven.
And women?
Can we enter or not?
Don't tempt me, female.
That's why I'm here isn't it?
You know, brute.
Here we're very free.
And we owe that to our French
mother superior.
He's Saharan.
But his mother was a Berber.
The Berber people, the amazigh,
is matriarchal...
...women transmit their cultural
essence.
Furthermore, they are monogamous.
They can even divorce.
Surely that's why so many Arab
countries hate them.
They've always been marginalized.
The amazigh women
educate their children very well.
They know how to raise good men.
I like that.
Yeah, but the video is missing
something, like it's not finished.
That's Said. He lives on the 3rd floor.
He lives in his own world.
He's a painter, like you. And he's
studying five majors.
He has special permission
from the government.
Said is a genius.
A prime male specimen.
Completely unique.
Does he turn you on?
Yeah.
Well, no.
This one's not for anybody.
How are you doing here?
It's the best place I could be.
As if it were waiting for me...
Ana...
...I think you should learn to paint
with oils.
The crayons give your work
a naive feeling.
You should free your subconscious.
Paint with more depth.
I paint to forget myself, to
get outside of myself.
I don't want depth.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Let's get out of here.
Do you want to come sleep next to me?
Next to you?
Yeah.
I sleep poorly.
I suffer.
I sleep really well.
I never dream.
Really?
Sometimes I daydream,
but never when I'm sleeping.
I must have some door closed.
I'd like that, to close
the door.
Well, let's stay inside.
I have another closed door...
...maybe it's the same one,
but I'd like to open it.
I've never fallen in love.
A house in the heavens.
Una casa en el cielo.
A garden in the sea.
A lark in your chest.
A new beginning.
A desire for stars.
The wing beat of a sparrow.
An island in your bed.
A sunset.
Time and silence.
Cries and songs.
Heavens and kisses.
Voice and breaking.
To be born in your smile.
To grow in your cry.
To live on your back.
To die in your arms.
Time and silence.
Cries and songs.
Heavens and kisses.
Voice and breaking.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry...
...I didn't want to wake you.
It's my nocturnal anguish.
We were going to sleep together
because I was going to help you.
You can't.
Yes, but right now everything
seems dark to you.
No, I don't live in the darkness.
I live in total light.
Sometimes I see the end...
...that's when I don't see anything.
Because there isn't anything!
Yes there is.
But living is useless.
It's a waste of time!
We met each other.
Just wait and you'll see that
this isn't a waste of time.
Hey, did you know that Justine is
keeping 60% of our work?
What do you think of that?
It doesn't seem so bad.
In the end, we're here because
of her.
Hey...
...what's up?
Something's not right.
I can smell it on you.
...fear of being in love
Wow!
And that smile, is a yes?
Okay, tell it to the 'eye'.
The prime male specimen.
No, I don't believe you.
No way, girl!
Well, well... How is he?
Well, he's not a walking dick.
You were right about that.
What a trick. Already in bed...
it doesn't get better than that.
It's more than that.
Oh? More than that?
So, what is it?
Now nobody else can try him?
Are you keeping him for yourself?
Yes.
Something happened to me too, with
somebody, and he's not a rapist.
Is the video yours?
Yeah, but it wasn't
an assignment.
I don't believe in God.
I believe in Woman, my only goddess.
So you're going to quit being
a whore to be a goddess?
Absolutely.
The truth is that Lucas
fits you well.
You think so?
Yeah.
Where is your "sultan"?
He's studying.
Studying or resting?
Pssst!
"Sahrawi Arab Democratic
Republic".
What's your country like?
I don't know, I've only seen
it on the map.
We Sahrawis can't live
in our country.
Why not, because it was
a Spanish colony?
Yeah, but 30 years ago...
...Spain gave us to Morocco, who
invaded...
...and pushed us out to the
Algerian desert.
And built a wall lined with
landmines...
...with the help of the United States.
And you?
Where are you from?
I grew up in a refugee camp
in Algeria.
In the hamada desert...
...one of the most inhospitable
areas on earth.
Winters are freezing.
And in the summer it reaches
60 degrees Celcius.
In my language, when somebody wants
to curse another to the worst hell...
...he says
"May God send you to the hamada".
Are these your parents?
No, look.
That's my mom.
She died with my dad in the
war with the Moroccans.
She was a Berber.
My father was a 'Bidant'.
My mother fought at his side
out of love.
And is that you?
Yeah, I'm an orphan of war, like
all those there.
And you haven't been in your
own country?
No, and that's approved by
the U.N.
Are you involved in politics?
Everything I do is so, one day...
...I can know how to help
my people.
I hope with all of my soul
that you will know how to do that.
With...
...your molecular biology, or with
whatever you want.
Without our biology, we aren't anything.
Our soul only makes sense
with our biology.
We need to discover a way
to make our biology last forever...
...dure siempre.
Well, back to your studies.
You want us to live forever?
You and me?
Yeah.
Sure!
How much time do we have left?
Finally, I found you.
Dear my monster of the caves.
I've finally fallen for a man.
Now I feel like I've always loved him.
It's what I was missing.
My Dear Daughter.
What you wrote is the most
wonderful and beautiful.
I repeat it to myself all day.
I celebrate that you have found...
...that love is an ancient treasure.
I don't have maternal instincts.
Why not? What do you think?
Because I love Said just for myself.
I don't need children as a medium.
For me, Lucas awakens my
maternal instincts.
Well, you can't tell.
That's live.
Telling stories.
Even more for women.
Lobster for five, and the same
wine as always. Thanks.
That is Jovoskaya, a psychologist who's
an expert in hypnosis.
In the United States, he's
one of the authorities.
Hello.
I was so interested by your latest book.
Thank you, thank you very much!
What are you doing in Madrid?
We just gave this great conference
about hypnotic regressions.
I have to go back to Los Angeles
tomorrow.
These young people are living
in my artist residence.
We are preparing a show
for Paris.
Those are my favorites
My Dark Beast,
you never told me about this.
Ana, what's wrong?
Breathe.
I'm falling, my love.
You look like you're getting
smaller and smaller.
I'm with you.
Don't let go of me.
¡No! ¡Aaaaaah!
Do you see that I'm not
letting you go?
Where are we?
This is a dream.
Linda.
I was dreaming.
No way!
How are you?
Good. What are you doing here?
Last night you flipped out.
Don't you remember?
The lobsters.
You were really messed up.
You were suffering a ton,
like somebody was killing you.
Why isn't Said here?
He left. Last night we went to look
for him and didn't find a trace.
I'm going to talk to Justine.
She'll know something.
Justine went to Paris.
I'll go to his room to see
if he left a note.
Ana...
...I already went. It's really strange.
He took everything with him.
I've been staying here to tell you.
I was dreaming about Said. It was my
first dream and it left with him.
That's a good sign.
Sure. Last night, the guy at
the table next to us...
...hypnotized you.
First, Jovoskaya, the psychologist
came over.
And said that her disciple was
the one who could help you the most.
He asked us to leave you
alone with him.
He said that he left you
in a hypnotic sleep.
Don't leave me like that, please.
I'll never understand it.
Ana...
...the guy who hypnotized you
is very interested in you.
He gave me his phone number
and that we call him.
Well, call him.
Maybe he knows something about Said.
Hi, this is Linda, Ana's friend.
The one that you hypnotized last night.
She just woke up...
I'd like to hypnotize her again.
It's fundamental, especially
for her.
Please tell her for me.
She says yes. When?
Right now, if she can.
The impression is very recent
and it would be easier.
Do you know anybody who
speaks Arabic?
Yes, Said.
Ana, don't worry. You'll
understand.
What am I going to understand?
Why did Said leave?
He was at your side during the hypnosis,
and he helped me.
Do what?
Even he got scared.
Why?
Ana, you have memories
that aren't from your own life.
Visions of things that you
haven't lived.
Do you believe that you lived
other lives before this one?
Before I met Said, never.
Last night you spoke in Arabic
with Said.
But he wouldn't translate for me.
Hey, hey!
I'm going to hypnotize you,
if y ou want.
Don't be afraid.
You can choose if you prefer
to be conscious...
...during the hypnosis...
...and remember everything,
or not be consicous.
No, I want to be unconscious.
Take me where you want to,
and then you guys can tell me about it.
I'm only interested in whatever
has to do with Said.
With his disappearance.
Ana...
...last night, you and I established...
...a hypnotic relationship.
I told you that whenever you heard
me count from 10 to 0...
...and only when you wanted...
...step by step, you would enter
a hypnotic sleep.
Ten...
...nine...
...eight...
...seven...
...six...
...five...
...four...
...three...
Ana.
Didn't you notice that you were
speaking Arabic?
What do you mean?
You spoke Arabic beautifully.
In the Hassaniyan dialect.
In Said's language, the language
of the Sahwari people.
We saw you die in the desert.
With him?
You spoke with him while
he died in your arms.
And what did I say?
I couldn't understand.
You were crying a lot.
A lot.
Look at yourself.
And me?
How did I die?
"The Birds".
Ana...
...I want to stay a while next
to you...
...to search your subconscious.
I can help you, Ana.
I think there's an abyss inside of you.
My Dear Cavedweller.
It's been a while since I last wrote
because a lot has happened to me.
Justine gave the third floor to
just Linda and me.
And for a friend of ours.
His name is Anglo.
He's from Los Angeles.
Said left in a blink.
Without telling me.
And left me empty inside.
Now I'm staying in his room.
Who better than me to live in
the desert?
Somebody's knocking at the door.
But I'm not going to open.
Somebody's knocking...
...and Anglo will open it for me.
I trust him.
Do you know anything about my doors?
My dear Ana,
It saddens me to see you like this.
But that's part of the risk of
leaving home.
I think that these misfortunes...
...will help you know how to live.
That's what it's about: knowing
how to live to know how to die.
And about coming to see me...
Wait, stay there.
Right now, I can't help you.
Nor should I. You should overcome
it yourself.
You don't want me to go?
Well, fine.
And I don't really understand
about your doors.
Explain it to me better
in your next letter.
I had never seen snow.
I need to remember to tell you about it.
This is the second tallest mountain
in the world, K2.
And this is Ana, a real
eightthousander.
A what?
70 years ago, you climbed
this mountain...
...that is more than 8,000
meters tall.
You were the lover of a
married man...
...who was always promising
to leave his wife for you.
And when you stopped believing
him...
...you went to the mountain
with four feminists.
So, the problem with guys is
always the same...
...there's no need to believe them.
And those with a conscience are
the worst, like Lucas.
He fucks everybody. I think he's
even fucked Justine.
I've seen some glances...
What are you talking about?
Not with her.
Why not? He's super horny.
He calls us goddesses to get to
fuck more. It's what they all want.
They all end up being
a bunch of rapists.
Deep down, yes. But every day we're
less and less whorish.
Well, I'm done with guys...
...and I'm going with you, my friend
to the mountain.
You were the first women in history to
reach 8,000 meters.
But you didn't come down.
I saw you freeze to death.
Ana, I have it recorded.
But this time, death is sweet.
¡Aaah!
I think that the horrible images
that you see...
...would go away if you saw
the videos.
Hi.
Hi, girls.
How's Ana's hypnosis going?
Well, each time, it gets easier,
but Ana doesn't dare look at herself.
Anglo can hypnotize me whenever
he wants, but I...
...want to see it less and less.
There's so much suffering.
There has been a lot of
the sexist rapist in your life.
Well, in your lives.
One day you'll wan to know everything.
And that will be good for you.
And you'll be able to see it.
The videos that we make
during the hypnosis...
...are yours, you know.
¿Can I see the last one?
Yeah.
I came to the mountain to forget you.
No.
I came to the mountain to
get your attention.
To meet up with you.
But you don't come.
I've already abandoned my life.
I came here to see...
if you had abandoned yours too.
You, woman.
Your children, for me.
Come!
I'm cold.
Now I'm alone.
I've seen my friends die.
Nobody will see us.
Calm down, Ana, it's me.
I came to rescue you.
But I'm going.
Pero te veo.
You smile at me...
It's really hard for me, Anglo.
Thanks for coming!
I can't handle it.
You're so sweet!
Ha, ha, ha!
What are you doing? Come on!
Hey, hey!
It doesn't surprise me that you're
still horny, if you stay faithful...
...to that asshole that left
you without an explanation.
Have I ever been a man?
To this point, you've always
been a woman.
A young woman.
That means that I've always
died in a tragic way.
Not a natural death, right?
Yeah. The less I know, the better.
Anglo, have you ever taken
advantage of me during a hypnosis?
With how many times you've
hypnotized me.
I'm talking about sex.
No.
Never, of course not.
I believe you.
But thinking about it, it wouldn't
matter to me if you did something.
Since I wouldn't remember it anyway.
If you want to, you have my consent.
I'd rather do it with you awake.
That's what I'd really like to do.
I'll only be yours through hypnosis.
My dear father in the caves,
You're right...
...I shouldn't go home until I
figure out my problems.
And don't worry about my doors,
I'm fine.
Ana...
...this has been the best hypnosis
session.
Your lives are getting older and older.
Not my lives, my deaths.
How long have I been here?
I'm hungry.
A day, but you ate lunch and dinner.
Not a lot, but...
I'm naked.
Last night I bathed you.
You were covered in sweat.
Two very important people
have met you.
Two true masters of hypnosis.
One came from Russia and the
other from Mexico.
They showed me some new paths.
Ana, your case is one-of-a-kind.
We found lives in you from
more than a thousand years ago.
You hardly say anything about some
of them, but others...
...are fascinating stories.
And we know that we can keep going.
I'd say let's keep going
until we reach the end.
Or the beginning.
Why is all of this happening to me?
I don't know, you have been all
of those women...
...or maybe just through you, during
hypnosis...
...we can make contact with them...
...or with part of their memories.
Sometimes they are only images.
But it's clear that they're part of you.
That's your chaos, Ana.
And who am I?
If I don't even have my own dreams.
Why don't I dream when I'm
alseep like everybody else?
Because you're scared, Ana.
Privately.
Since through you we can make
contact with other lives...
...that were lost in time...
...go back a bit and look at them.
I want to ask you something...
...something different.
I want a conscious hypnosis.
That's a good step.
But right now I only want to return
to the Sahara.
To when I lived there with Said.
I want to remember, not death,...
...but the happy times with him.
And I'll record it.
Don't record anything.
I'll record it here.
This is really personal.
Now, while I count
from 10 to 7...
...from 10 to 7,
con cada número...
...your body is getting rigid and heavy.
Ten...
...nine...
...eight...
...seven.
Your body is becoming rigid,
heavy, and hard.
But only your body is like that.
Your spirit is weightless.
If you want, you can separate them.
Leave the bed here in the bed.
Now, I'll count from 6 to 4...
...and you won't feel your body.
Six...
...five...
...four.
You'll have your eyes open
during the hypnosis.
The more you see...
...the deeper your hypnosis will be.
Now, I want you to imagine that
you're walking...
...next to a mountain.
To one side is the sea.
You're looking for the entrance
to a cave.
A particular cave.
You feel the breeze on your face.
And you hear the rumble of the waves.
Soon you discover.
It's your cave, Ana.
You enter.
You're completely alone.
You notice that the walls
are full of closed...
...doors.
Your subconscious is going
to choose a door.
You're going to stand in front
of the chosen door.
Now, you open it carefully.
You're going to enter...
...and when I count from 3...
...to 0, you will appear...
...in another time...
...and in another space,
that you have chosen.
Three, two...
...one, zero.
¿Are you in the life you wanted?
Yes.
I'm in the Saharan Republic, my country.
How old are you?
I don't know, I'm a little girl.
And what's your name?
Saida.
A man on a camel is coming.
It's my father. I'm lost...
...and he has come to find me.
Good, now we're going to move...
...forward in Saida's life.
I'm going to count again
from 3 to 0...
...and let your unconscious...
...choose an important memory.
Three...
...two...
...one...
...zero.
Now, where are you, Saida?
How old are you?
Something's happening to me.
We're at war.
I don't know what I have.
There are people taking care of me.
Are you hurt?
I've got it now...
I'm about to give birth.
Is your husband with you?
No.
I don't see him.
¡Aaah!
¡Yasir!
Aaah! It hurts a lot!
I had a child with him.
Congratulations, Saida.
Now, I'm going to count again
from 3 to 0.
And let your subconscious take us...
...to another chosen moment.
Please, wait.
A mother was just born too.
I'm the luckiest man.
Thank you, Saida!
Thank you!
Yasir!
This is the happeist day
of my life!
Three...
...two...
...one...
...zero.
Now, where are you, Saida?
In a prison camp.
Moroccan soldiers are
guarding us.
Why don't I have my son with me?
Now I remember.
A soldier took him away.
It's Yasir.
He's coming to rescue me.
Let's go!
No!
Get me out of here, please.
Calm down, you'll be out
in a moment.
Three. You return to the door
and enter the cave.
Two. Leave the cave.
One. Everything is black.
Zero.
And you're here.
Holy Shit!
My asshole father left my
mother in the fucking street.
He had an 'individualism attack'...
...he sold the apartment
and bought a sailboat.
I can't stand men!
I can't stand them!
I'm done with it!
I don't have anything left
inside to give to guys.
Not even a little handful.
Ana, you have to fucking give up
on the world of men...
...who rot us all from the inside.
It will just be us women, with
some conscience.
And fucking forget Said for once.
Worry about yourself a little.
Take seriously what you have inside,
because what you have...
...that you don't want to see,
must mean something.
I'm making a montage
with all of that.
to see if you understand
something.
You know what pisses me off
most about my dad?
The prick was able to buy
the same boat he sold.
"El Linda". He's getting it ready to
go to New York.
By himself.
¡Aaah!
¡Aaaah!
¡Aaaah!
Ana...
...I have news from your father.
He needs to abandon the house.
The cave?
Yes.
Who told you?
Some friends of yours,
from Valencia.
The San Juans.
Now he's living with them.
I have to go. My dad will
die outside of his cave.
He'll get used to it. Living alone
in a cave can't be good.
That's why he didn't let me
go see him. He must be fighting...
...with some politician and he didn't
want to worry me.
Ana...
...it's kind of urgent.
Your father needs you to go
as soon as possible.
I know that he'd never drive a car.
Not even yours.
No. Let's go.
Ana...
...your dad is sick.
Aren't they having the fair in your
town now?
That's why I didn't want you
to come...
...until he felt better.
But he has cancer, Ana.
And now he knows that
he's going to die.
It's because I left.
Don't say that.
Okay, I won't say it.
But I'll always think it.
He wants to dance with you,
like when you were a little girl.
Hold me tightly, Maria.
Hold me tightly...
...it's cold tonight...
...and I can't sleep.
Hold me tightly, Maria.
Hold me tightly...
...I'm scared...
...and don't have anywhere
to go.
Tomorrow when you wake up...
...I'll be far away.
I don't think it's anything...
...I've been through worse.
In case I don't see you again...
...forget that I made you suffer.
If I disappear, I don't want...
...anybody to remember who I was.
Hold me tightly, Maria.
Hold me tightly...
...the night is so cold...
...and I can't sleep.
Hold me tightly...
...My Ana.
Hold me tightly...
...I'm scared...
...and I don't know where to go.
I've been the happiest man
in the world.
Hold me tightly, Maria.
- Because I've had you.
Hold me tightly...
...I'll come back for you one day...
...and we'll escape together.
Hold me tightly, Maria.
Hold me tightly...
...I'm scared...
...and I don't know where to go.
I'm scared and I don't...
...know where to go.
I'm alone, I'm happy, dammit!
Free!
I'm free!
¡Yiaaaa!
¡Aaaah!
Linda!
Linda, is that you?
Are you trying to punish me?
Well, it worked!
Ismael, you don't know me.
I'm Ana.
What else are you?
Well...
...I guess I'm your stowaway.
That's how it is, but I'll
help you with everything.
I don't want a fucking stowaway.
Sorry, that was my fault.
I grabbed the rope as I left the cabin.
This is my boat. You've
snuck onto a part of me.
I know...
...I found out that you were going
to New York and...
Aaaah!
Linda!
I'm Linda's friend!
My dear cave monster.
Here I am in the Atlantic.
The souls of the dead
don't go anywhere, do they?
They only fly around
to enter the living.
I don't want to fly.
I just want to stay with you.
You're a friend of Linda's?
That's what you screamed in the water.
Is that why you came
back for me?
No.
Do you want to know what your
daughter thinks of you?
You shouldn't believe
everything she says about me.
I lived with her.
What time is it there?
I only want to know what
is happening here.
Me too.
From now on.
Hold on tight!
Hold on!
This is the first time that I've
spent so much time with a man.
A man other than my father.
Tomorrow afternoon we'll
enter the port at Manhattan.
I want to tie up for a few months
in Manhattan.
New York. New life.
Then I'll follow the coast.
To the south, unhurried,
until I get to Brazil.
I want to live by renting out the
boat with a crew.
If you stay with me, I'll teach
you to sail.
I don't have any idea what
I want to do.
Where to go.
A house in the heavens.
A garden in the sea.
A lark in your chest.
A new beginning...
I'm sorry I'm not your prince in blue.
Well, almost.
You're always close.
How did you find me?
Linda's dad.
I was just at the port.
I was on his boat.
Are you going to keep up
your game with him?
Why have you come?
I'm sorry, Ana, but it was very
important to find you.
We have studied a lot.
Oh yeah?
For the final hipnosis, to
reach the origin.
So what?
Look where I am now.
This is New York, the most
open city in the world.
And you're far from your life,
aren't you?
But you know what's strange?
You've never been closer to
yourself than now, here.
By trying to go away, you
got closer to your origin.
To your beginning.
And how do you think I'll
die this time?
Ana, look at me.
I really wanted to see you.
I love you so much!
You think that I'll see him
again, don't you?
We have entered the
indian reservation.
Look, my beast, it's a cave.
I really wanted to see you again,
Ana.
It broke my heart
when I found out...
...that you had left without
telling me.
I understood you, but I
also felt guilty.
So, why did you come?
To help you understand.
If you leave me.
What I have to understand
gets older and older, doesn't it?
Yes, about 2,000 years...
Aaah!
What's wrong, Ana?
It hurts.
Let's get out of here.
It's most important that you feel good.
It's because of something that happened
here to you that's still at the surface.
She has realized this too.
What happened?
We're not sure.
That's why I had you brought here.
Come on.
Mother! mother, mother...
of good men!
Of the good men!
She wants you to grab it, Ana.
You can do it, Ana!
You know that I'm no mystic.
Come on, Ana.
We're with you.
Don't be afraid, Ana.
We're together now.
Now I've given my name.
Say it!
"Oxtatziaca".
That was your name!
I got it right the first try?
And for your people,
goddes of life.
At what age was I killed?
22.
Oh no. I'm 21.
I'm alive now, inside of you.
Ten...
...nine...
...eight...
...seven...
...six...
We're getting you ready for
a surprise from Madrid.
Hi, Ana.
Well, first of all...
...I miss you a lot. You should
know that.
Now, there have been
some changes around here.
My mother is sleeping
in your bed now.
She says to thank you. She's
around somewhere.
She knows that you're
with my father on his boat.
On "El Linda".
But, well...
...she says that she's a lot better
without him, though she didn't know it.
So, good for her.
And I...
You're going to laugh, girl.
I got back together with Lucas.
So, I'm a goddess again,
shared of course.
But I haven't come to terms with it.
And you... "wind in my sails"
It's "wind at the stern"...
However it's said.
That.
What a wind.
Let the wind carry you,
my love.
My dear friend.
My best friend.
Who are you?
"Oxtatziaca".
Please stop that!
Ana, that was the man that you
loved. He dethroned you.
He killed the goddess...
...and a war between brothers
broke out among your people.
Put it at the end.
Take those feathers off, ritght now!
What's happening to the feathers?
She has dressed herself like a bird.
Her brothers are going to be angry.
I won't go with you if you're
dressed like that.
I'm disgusted by your pride!
Let go of the hatchet right now!
Don't be an animal!
If you hit me again...
...you'll lose me forever.
Ana! She shines when she's dying.
That's when she becomes wise and
speaks to you.
You need to listen to her.
I'm scared.
Be brave.
But I'm not.
Ana, deep down,
you are brave!.
The bravest!
Because your concsience of
humanity is deteriorated.
But because of the feminine...
...it's an instinct to live, not to die.
You have to open yourself and explore.
I don't have to do anything.
Whatever you say, princess.
I'm free.
I've never liked mothers.
The tape is yours, Ana.
It's up to you.
Your life must have some purpose.
You need to look for it.
I don't have a purpose. Period.
Anglo, please hypnotize me
for what's left of the trip.
Ten, nine...
...eight, seven...
...six, five...
...four, three...
...two, one...
...zero.
Now you're going to relax
because you've had a very hard day.
Don't think about anything.
I understand, my love.
I understand.
I'll open in two hours...
...you came late, there's nobody
to wait for you.
But I can make a crepe for you.
What kind do you want?
Sugar.
How did you get here?
Justine found me and told
me where you were.
Is this yours?
No, a friend's.
And how are things here?
Good, good.
I try to live my life,
if they let me.
I'm talking about the present.
And then you show up...
...and get in the way.
You're really screwing with me, Said!
No.
Stay where you were,
please.
This is the best place
I could be.
Yeah, as if it were waiting for me.
And you, how have you been...
...in Guantanamo?
In Guantánamo?
Yeah. Well, after you left without
saying anything...
I could believe that anything
happened to you.
Ana...
...I came to ask you to forgive me.
Five dollars, please.
Ana...
...after your attack, with everything
that we saw...
...I had another one...
...that nobody saw.
And I understood that
I couldn't help you.
I would have hurt you.
You spoke to me in Arabic.
What did you say?
What did I say?
That night, you realized...
...that when our biology ends,
not everything is over.
That our soul can fit
in another organism.
You said that in the end,
there's nothing...
...But it's the other way.
We're accumulating.
Death doesn't empty, it fills.
Let's take a walk.
So, have you found a way to make it
last longer? Our biology.
No.
Do you think that if we didn't die,
we'd be able to love...
...passionately?
I don't want to live forever.
I just want to live with you.
That's what I want.
That's my window.
Everything's okay, calm down.
I'm sorry.
Is there another woman?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't ask that.
What's important is that we
have found each other.
So, now we're going to start
a life together.
Where are we going?
To your desert?
Yeah, may God send us to
the Hamada.
Ghamada.
Yeah, even if we
die together again...
...devoured by birds.
Because you know what
happened, don't you?
What I'm saying is that
I'm going with you.
Wherever you want.
Come on, say yes, and today
will be the happiest day of my life.
Ana...
...I wasn't Yasir.
That sahwari
that you loved so much.
Why not, how do you know?
I'm Said, his son.
Also the son of Saida.
My parents were prisoners
in a Moroccan camp.
There, a soldier took away your son.
My mother was a well-known Berber.
From a long time before.
She possessed the energy of other
wise women.
Amazigh women...
...who came before her.
That's why the Moroccans left her
to be eaten by the birds.
They thought that that way...
...her soul would be dispersed
in the air.
The only thing of hers that they
returned to my village...
...was this ring.
So, I was your mother.
Your bete noire of a mother.
It's good that you weren't
with us.
Aaaaah!
I saw him, I'm sure it's him.
Who?
The fatty that's eating in the
side room.
He's one of those assholes...
...that started the damn
war in Iraq...
...that took our Paquito.
You're here, Ana. You're not scared!
Let's go, together!
We're all here...
with you!
Italian?
Italian-American.
Wait!
The other half is for you,
He sucked it.
I love Italians.
You're playful.
When I want to be.
What about you?
With women I like.
And with men you like,
what do you do...
Do you send them to war,
so they get killed?
I didn't invent war.
Wars were invented by
men like you.
But I'm sure that you
are good at heart.
You can't be that bad.
I feel it on my lips.
There was something good,
Even if you don't believe it.
Where are you from?
España.
Hispanic?
Yes, gorgeous.
But it doesn't matter to you.
In a half hour.
Suite 2000.
Wait for me at the door.
In an hour,
I still have work to do.
I'm doing it for you,
so they don't suspect.
And you, wait here for me.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Come here, you hispanic beauty.
España.
I'm Spanish.
In Europe, yes, below France.
Oh, you're European!
Yes.
In this life, but...
I've also been North American.
- Really?
- Yep,
a real North American.
Indian.
And...
a little while ago,
in another previous life,
- I was Arab.
- Arab.
I can speak Arabic.
You're...
not a terrorist, are you?
Do I look like a terrorist?
I'm a sexual terrorist.
So, blow me!
But I'm not a whore.
I'll pay you, if that's what you want.
No.
Your market isn't min.
I'm here because I want to be,
even though you don't believe it,
and I'm going to give myself to you.
Because,
you're obviously...
...not the kind that gives.
You're the kind...
...that takes.
All women are whores.
And all men are fucking rapists.
Yeah!
I just know that if I pay you, you'll
do it better.
If you want,
I'll pretend I don't want to fuck
and you can rape me.
You smell wonderful!
I'll taste better.
¿What...?
What is this!
Is this shit?
It's a poetic act,
it's not important.
Who the fuck are you,
you don't get to shit on me!
Fuck it, I'm sorry. I was mistaken.
I thought you had something good
inside you, but you don't.
Yeah?
Yeah, well fuck you, you little cunt!
Stop her!
Stop her, dammit!
Don't let her get away!
Don't obey him, let's get
out of here!
Turn her around!
Turn her around, dammit!
She's Arab. We've got a fucking
terrorist!
You fucking witch!
Even if you kill me 2000 times...
I'll be reborn.
You can never defeat me,
because I am the mother
of good men.
I will give birth to an army of boys...
who will become good men.
This column is Doric.
And I am Greek.
Ha, ha, ha!
A house in the heavens.
A garden in the sea.
A lark in your chest.
A new beginning.
A desire for stars.
The wingbeat of a sparrow.
An island in your bed.
A sunset.
Time and silence.
Cries and songs.
Heavens and kisses.
Voice, breaking.
To be born in your smile.
To grow in your cry.
To live in your back.
To die in your arms.
Time and silence.
Cries and songs.
Heavens and kisses.
Voice, breaking.
A house in the heavens.
A garden in the sea.
A lark in your chest.
A new beginning.
A desire for stars.
The wingbeat of a sparrow.
An island in your bed.
A sunset.
Time and silence.
Cries and songs.
Heavens and kisses.
Voice, breaking.
Cries and songs.
Cries and songs.
Voice, breaking.
