The Queen Mary, thegreatest
passenger Iiner in the world...
brings home the greatest human cargo
New York Harbor has ever seen.
Almost 1 5,000 troops
get an eager glimpse ofthe U.S. ofA.
Past the towers of Manhattan
steams the 83,000-ton British liner.
[ Ship Horn Blowing ]
These victorious G.I.s have done their duty.
They answered their country's caIl,
left theirjobs, their families,
their sweethearts...
and beat the Nazi tyranny
on a thousand battlefields.
For some- the psychological victims ofwar-
it wiIl be a long road back.
These men wilI need time to rebuild
the lives they set aside when Uncle Sam caIled.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
For others-
the G.I.s ofthe "DearJohn" letters-
it means starting over,
replacing what they have lost.
They faced one challenge and won.
They can win this one too.
Welcome home.
Let dancing replace marching.

[ Woman's Voice ]
I don't know how to tell you this.
I really don't want to hurt you,
but I just can't wait foryou any longer.
I know I promised to wait.
I really did try,
but it's been so much longer
than either of us expected.
So much has happened,
and you're so far away.
I hope you understand how I feel.
I know I said I loved you,
but I'm young...
and I have to Iive my Iife now.
And who knows how long
it wiIl be before you return.
I hope you don't hate me
for leaving you this way.
But perhaps, when the war is over,
we can be friends again.
PIease take care ofyourself.
I continue to worry about you.
Sincerely, Rosemary.

There's Tom Caldwell's Cadillac.
Well, I'll be dogged.
Say, who's he going
out with now anyway?
Linda Booth.
Do you believe it?
With Linda Booth?
[ Chuckling ]
I thought she was going out
with Georgie Wise.
Didn't you hear?
Well, I heard Georgiejoined
the air corps, all right, but-
Wait a minute.
Georgie didn't get-
They broke up.

Now let's have a big hand
for the band.
Swell job, fellas.
We were all saddened
by the great Glenn Miller's
tragic death...
somewhere in the skies
over France.
But he left us a wonderful legacy
in his music.
And now for all those
fine young men here tonight...
just back from overseas,
I'd like to ask the band to play
one of his best tunes.
Oh, look. There's Pat Kingsley.
[ Bandleader Continues,
Indistinct ]
Well, Pat Kingsleyjust-
just came home from the Pacific.
So?
Come on.
Let's go up to the point.
Oh, not now.
It's too early.
Come on. This place is dead.
We'll come back later.
[ Bandleader]
FoIks, I bet you never saw
a more sober group ofguys.
Hey! Keep your mitts
off my girl!
The drummer told me his wife
wouldn't let him in the house...
if he ever showed up again...
with that little brown jug.
δδ [ Rim Shots ]
So let's cheer him up,
and everybody swing!
δδ [ "Little Brown Jug" ]
Who is that creep?
Oh, that'sjustJimmy Turner.
He takes care ofthis place.
What does he do,
sweep it with his eye?
No, but I hear he sleeps
on an old mattress
in the basement.
[ Scoffing Laugh ]
Sounds like a swell guy.
[ Chattering ]
Oh, isn't it beautiful?
Ifyou really like it,
I'll buy it foryou.
Oh, Roy.

Looks a little crooked to me.
Oh, yeah?
How's that?
Maybe a little bit higher.
Like that? Is that better?
Yeah. It looks great.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.
Mark. How about this side?
WelI, if it isn't Deputy London
keeping an eye on things.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Hi, Pam.
Hi, Mark.
Well, I guess you don't
need me anymore.
Where you goin'?
Uh, to drop these off.
The graduation edition?
Yeah. Wejust finished
this morning.
You have a spare?
Yeah, but we had
to print these very small,
and I wouldn't want you
to strain your eyes
twice in one day.
Well, maybe you can
read it to me over lunch.
Okay.
All right. I gotta stop by
the office first though.
If I don't, the sheriffwill kill me.
They haven't had
a graduation dance since 1 945...
because Major Chatham
wouldn't allow it.
Well, he'd stop it now if he could.
But he can't. Since the stroke,
no one's even seen him.
You know, I feel sorry for him.
He's all alone in that house,
so close to where he found
his daughter and that boy.
State police called
about an hour ago.
Somebody robbed a market
up near Columbus.
Cut some kid up
and took his car.
They think he may
be headed this way.
Are you still gonna leave?
I can't start the summer without fishing.
You know that. I never could.
Besides, you've been here
for two years now.
You can handle anything
that might come along.
Here you go.
You were so anxious to read it before.
"Pam MacDonald."
I'm impressed.
Thankyou.
Check, please.
I guess with the, uh, sheriff leaving,
you'll be on duty tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Oh.
I was hoping maybe you could come by
the graduation dance a little later.
Well, maybe I can
come by for a while.
Mark?
Hmm?
You don't think the guy who robbed
that store might come here, do you?
I don't think so.
State police will get him soon.
Yeah, well, until they do,
be careful.
Okay?
Hey, Pam. Over here.
Hi, Carl.
Hey. I read your article.
Oh.
Wanna go make out
on the point?
[ Laughs ]
I don't know.
Is it worth the risk?
Are you kidding?
Did you taste the punch?
It's kind of, uh, bland.
It is now.
But as soon as "el chaperono"
isn't looking, we'll-
Shh!
Is the punch ready?
Yes, Miss Allison.
You're gonna
get us all in trouble.
Well, Captain,
ifyour men are after him,
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.
Yeah, my deputy will let you know
if he sees anything.
Mark.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
[ Chuckles ]
He's a good boy.
You're damn right
it's my fishing trip.
And ifyou bother me
about anything, Bill,
I'll kickyour ass
right across the state line, okay?
[ Laughing ]
Okay. Good-bye.
Now, ifyou need anything,
you got my number.
The worst you'll probably have will be some
ofthose kids from the dance running wild.
Now,just remember,
there's still some people
around here who, uh,
won't put up
with that kind ofthing.
Yes, sir.
[ Laughs ]
You'll do fine.
Come on down to Kingsley's
with me.
I've got some things
I gotta pick up.
Oh, no. Major's orders, Ray.
Otto, get out here!
I'm- I'm right
at the good part.
Now, goddamn it, the major
doesn't wanna be kept waiting.
All he does is wait...
and watch some girls.
Hey. Have you been
sneaking around again?
Now, I told you-
[ Door Opens, BellJingles ]
Now get movin'.
We got customers.
Well, afternoon, George.
Hi, Pat.

Hi, girls.
Hi.
Hey, you.

Yeah, we finally got that banner

What you doin', Deputy,

Yeah.
Gonna be at the dance,
won't you?
I'll try.
Try real hard.
Hey, how you doin', girls?
Now, what the hell you doin'
still out here?
[ Pat ]
I don't know, George.
Sometimes I wonder why
I've taken care of him so long.
Well, I- I gotta go
tend to the customers.
This time, uh, why don't you
use those minnows for bait, huh?
[ Snaps Fingers ]
Bye, Pat.
Are they graduating
this year?
Yeah.
They're friends
of Pam MacDonald.
They don't seem like her type.
Now, remember,
ifyou have any problems, call me.
Have a good time.
I will.
Hi.
Hi.
What do you think?
This one?
I like it.
Or how about this one?
[ Laughing ]
I don't know
what the difference is.
I mean, with Carl around,
it's not gonna stay on
too long anyway, right?
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
He is a real animal.
Any ofyou Pritcher girls
got any rolling papers?
Uh, I think I do.
Thankyou very much.
I'll roll you a couple
for later.
Carl gave 'em to me.
[ Chuckles ]
Hey, you're not gonna
mope around tonight, are you?
This is everybody's
last night together.
And some of us will never
see each other again.
Sherry.
I'm worried about Mark.
He'll come to the dance.
I know. It's not that.
It's- It's that guy who stabbed
that man in Columbus.
I thought you said
they're about to catch him.
Yeah, that's what Mark says.
[ Clicks Tongue ]
I wish the sheriffwas here.
Hey, Lisa.
I just spilled nail polish
all overyour dress.
Yeah, you do and I'll kill you.
[ Laughs ]
Lisa, you'd better cIose those shades.
You're gonna give old man Chatham
another stroke.
Are you kiddin'?
That old guy's harmless.
He can't even get
out of his wheelchair.
Yeah, but there's nothing wrong
with his eyes.
He's been staring at us all semester.

Oh, yeah?

What the hell was Major Chatham

Chatham probably hasn't even
been up there since his last stroke.
You find anything?
Look at this.
So what?
It's the major's daughter.
Francis Rosemary Chatham.
They must have called her Rose.
And look. See? I found
a pressed rose in the yearbook.
And the killer left behind
a rose in her hands.
Didn't you read my article?
They never found out who did it.
But it had to be someone in town,
someone who knew that she was called Rose,
and, Mark, that guy
still might be around here.
Oh, man. I don't believe this.
You're talking about something
that happened over 30 years ago.
Pam. The guy who chased you may be the one
the state police are looking for right now.
I say let's get the hell out of here
and go to the dance
and see that everyone stays inside.
Maybe you should call the sheriff.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Okay. I didn't mean that.

they use it all the time for parties and stuff.
Ha! Right!
What kind of people?
Come on, Sally. It's great. I'll show you.

Why don't we

You don't think
he'd still be there, do you?
It's all we have to go on.
Oh, but Mark,
what about Major Chatham?
I'm not gonna break
into the man's house
twice in one night.
Well. Lookee here.
Now, George left you in charge here.
Can't you keep them kids under control?
What are you doing here, Kingsley?
It's that damn graduation thing.
We haven't had any trouble out ofthat college
for more than 30 years, and...
now they have to
start that damn thing over again.
- What do you mean?
- There's a bunch of kids
over there in the cemetery.
I know what they're doin' in there.
Now, what are they
doing in there, Kingsley?
Hell, it was dark.
I couldn't see anything.
Well, ifyou couldn't see anything,
why don't you just go home?
Sure.
But that gate was wide open.

Why are we stopping here?
I want you to go inside
and see ifeverything's under control.
All right?

I want you to stay at the dance.
What?
I'm going up to Chatham's alone.
