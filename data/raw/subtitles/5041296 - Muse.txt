"Through me you pass
into the city of woe.
"Through me you pass
into eternal pain.
"Through me among the
people lost for aye.
"Justice the founder
of my fabric moved
"To rear me was the task
of Power divine,
"Supreme Wisdom,
and primeval Love.
"Before me things
create were none,
"save things Eternal
"and eternal I endure.
"Abandon all hope all ye
"who enter here."
And now you've listened
to that powerful reading,
can anyone tell me
why Dante's Inferno
is still so important today?
Am I to abandon all hope?
Lawrence.
Because he imagined hell.
Yeah.
Yeah, because he imagined hell.
He shared with us a version of
man's experience and
relationship to existence
to his sins, to his own mortality.
I mean, you all come here,
ladies and gentlemen
to get lost in the classics and
be inspired by the great masters
but also to begin and to
try to make sense of your own
descent into hell.
So, instead of the usual critical
analysis of Dante's Inferno,
I would like you
to provide me with an
alternative poetic proposal
to Dante's Hell.
Your own.
Your struggles,
your fears, your sins
whatever they may be.
Oh, and uh...
I want it by Monday.
Yeah, good weekend.
All right.
Thanks.
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes.
Oh, really?
Oh, hello, Susan. Thanks.
Aren't you the hippest
professor of them all?
Darling, I would never dare
take that title away from you.
Well, I didn't just publish a book.
That obviously helped.
Don't worry, by this time next week,
they would have forgotten all about it.
There's a rectoral dinner
at my place tonight.
Select professors only.
Please come.
Ah, I'm afraid I can't tonight.
I have plans.
-Plans?
-Mm-hmm.
I imagine they're not staying
at home correcting exams.
Not exactly.
-Have a good weekend.
-You too.
Do you mind giving me
a lift, Professor?
-Are you sleeping?
-Mmm.
Why do you smell so good?
I'd like to stay like this
forever.
Not move, just stay here.
I don't think my publisher
would be too happy about that.
He has other writers,
he'll get over it.
You'll have to give up
going to university.
-Mm, I wouldn't mind.
-You wouldn't mind?
No.
We'll never be able
to make love again.
If it's only for that, we'll move.
How long have we been together?
I don't know, um, almost a year?
Thirteen months.
-Thirteen months?
-Mmm.
And no one knows.
So?
Do you love me, Samuel?
What sort of question is that?
-Don't laugh, I'm being serious.
-Well...
I mean it.
If you loved me, you wouldn't be
hiding from everyone all the time.
No.
But then the entire university
would be gossiping about us.
Is that what you want?
Just, I don't want
this ever to end.
Neither do I.
Then promise me.
You'll love me forever.
Okay.
Say it.
I promise.
Not like that, say it.
I promise.
I will love you forever.
Bye.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
You hungry?
You still love me, don't you?

Baby, um
we've run out of cat food, so

No, no.
Oh, my God, what have you done?
Beatriz? Beatriz, come on!
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
Hold on!
What have you done? Shit!
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Baby, come on.
No!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
No!
Here you go.
Empty.
I know, but this is the reference,
that's what I'm saying.
I missed it, perhaps, ma'am.
You think you can manage?
Yeah, sure, I'll catch you later.
Hey.
Here I was thinking I would never
see you around here again.
Well, I'm sure there
are some people...
who'd be delighted
if that were the case.
I don't think that's true.
How are you?

Of course.

How long have you
been having them?
Every night
for the past... three weeks.
Are you seeing anyone
to help you with this?
First, I had a
a grief counselor but I decided
that wasn't really for me.
I'm sure it has
occurred to you that
these dreams might have
something to do with
what happened.
The woman in my dreams
looks nothing like Beatriz.
No, what I mean is like, y-your
head is trying to get rid of
the pain that's inside you,
like, you know, therapy.
It's got nothing
to do with that, okay?
Have you written anything?
I've got nothing to say.
Pfff.
Write about your dream.
Oh, sure. I'll become
a horror writer.
What's wrong about that?
Horror writers are sexy.
Come on.
Poets are starving, boring.
Oh, on that note,
I got that for your birthday
and then you disappeared, so...
better late than never.
Happy birthday to you.
Open it.
Now, that's what I call pressure.
Come on, use it for
your grocery list.
Or to correct exams.
You are a professor, remember?
And a good one, so.
Why don't you stop
biting your nails?
Fuck you.
You miss me already?
Are you at home? Samuel?
Yeah, just got back.
Switch on the TV.
The local news channel.
Quick.
-Why?
-Just do it.
-Do it!
-Okay, okay.
Do you have it?
Murder has shaken the quiet
-Yeah.
-sleepy suburb of Ballsbridge.
A Garda spokesman has said
that the badly beaten corpse
was found on the second story
surrounded by what appears to be a
makeshift white circle on the floor.
Gardaí believe the event has all the
hallmarks of a ritual-type killing.
Samuel?
-Further forensic investigation
-Samuel?
to establish the exact course of
events is currently underway.
She was killed
a couple of days ago.
And apparently a
cleaning lady found her
when she arrived in the morning.
Okay.
She was an Italian lady
and her name, uh...
her name is Lidia Garetti
and this is the woman
I saw in my dreams.
This is her. I am positive.
Samuel, do you realize
how incredible this is?
Yes.
You dreamt about something that
was going to happen before it did.
Before it did.
That's called a
premonitory dream.
But why me? Why?
-I-I don't even know this woman.
-I don't know.
There has to be an explanation.
We'll figure it out.
No, we will not.
This is not one of your
esoteric adventures.
This woman is dead.
This is real.
And I saw how it happened.
Really? What are you gonna do?
Who are you going to talk to-
the police?
What are you going to say?
"Hi, inspector, um...
"I know what happened to the
Italian woman in Ballsbridge.
"I wasn't there, but
I saw it in my dream."
Do you realize what
that looks like?
It's crazy.
Wait!
Wait!
Stop!
-No!
-Stop!
No! Please don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just tell me what
you're doing here.
Are y-you a policeman?
No, no, I'm... I'm...
Wait, who are you?
Were you stealing?
No.
No, I...
I saw what happened
to that...woman on TV.
Did you know her?
No. No, no.
Then why?
What about you?
If you're not with
the police, then...
I just know it.
You dreamt about it
too, didn't you?
You have to see something.
Follow me.
Jesus Christ.
Notice anything different?
I realized as soon as I came in.
Something was missing.
-There.
-Yes.
Those shelves.
There was a...
-There was a door.
-Exactly.
Be careful.
Oh, shit.
It's the battery.
-I've got some matches.
-Yeah?
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
Oh, Christ.
Why on earth would you
keep an aquarium up here?
Don't know.
There's...
There's something in there.
What is that?
Let's find out.
Some kind of inscription on it.
"You see the beast that
made me turn aside"
That's... that's Dante.
Yeah, that's right.
Whoever killed her was
looking for something.
You saw the house.
This could be what they're after.
But she wanted us to find it.
That's why we had
the same dream.
Think about it.
Shit.
Let's go.
Hurry!
Hey!
Stop there!
Stop!
Stop!
Tomorrow at 7:00.
There's a waiting list.
The White Ring was some
sort of experimental
literary circle that
used to meet there.
And it seems some of
their concerns were too
esoteric to be taken seriously.
Shakespeare.
The impossible sonnets.
Nobody's ever been able
to decipher them.
-Including Shakespeare himself.
-Mm-hmm.
He says they've been dictated
to him in his dreams
-by a dark lady.
-Mm-hmm.
Milton... my specialty.
He tells of his experience
of meeting a lady
by the name of Herberia on
the outskirts of Florence.
Mm.
According to him, she was the
inspiration for Paradise Lost.
Keats, Blake, the
references are endless.
They all hint at having had
some contact with the muses.
-Number one invites.
-Mm-hmm.
Number two invokes.
Number three lies.
Number four punishes.
Number five foretells.
Number six impassions.
Number seven hides.
The seven ladies.
Yeah, the mystery of the muses.
Is there more?
Well, your friends through the White
Ring took the subject too far.
For years they published
their theories
in all sorts of
specialized magazines.
First, in academic
circles, then in
marginal occult publications.
And in all of them, they
claim that they met them.
What is this?
Poetic inspiration taken from
nature in the form of a woman.
Supernatural beings
of inconceivable evil.
Immortal witches
invoking poetry
through the use of spells.
Okay.
Well, do you think
we can find these guys?
I could call Berkeley
through the department
but I'm kind of getting
tired of being a secretary.
You went to that house
without telling me.
You found a treasure in
some kind of aquarium and
suddenly a girl showed up
out of nowhere and took it.
If I had been there, that
would not have happened.
So, are you gonna help me
find these guys or what?
Mom!
What's that?
Nothing. Just something I found.
Are you annoyed?
What?
I don't know, you seem weird.
What do you mean?
No, baby, I'm just...
pfff, I'm just tired, is all.
You going to work tonight?
Just for a little while.
But I'll be back soon.
I promise.
And you know what?
What?
Tonight's my last night.
I'm not going back there again.
Really?
Ever!
He's in go noogie wig!
There's uh, five of them.
Lee Barlow, Matthew Osmen, Lawrence
Colbert, Barry Sutton, Herbert Rauschen.
Great. Um, can we reach them?
Wait.
Lee Barlow stabbed
himself six years ago.
28 times to be precise
in front of his family.
Matthew Osmen, a strange
degenerative disease
that rots the tissue until the
victim collapses to death.
Doctors still don't understand.
Barry Sutton was found
dead on a Portland dock.
He had been devoured from the
inside by an unidentified insect.
The interesting detail is
they found a verse by Baudelaire
scratched onto his body by a knife.
Lawrence Colbert went mad.
He stabbed several children
who were on their way
home at the school gates.
The police shot him down.
And you know what?
They also found verses
tattooed on his back.
So, it looks like we
have no witnesses left.
That's it.
No, no, no, no, wait.
You said there...
What about Herbert Rauschen?
Berkeley doesn't have
any records of him.
In fact, they didn't
even recognize his name.
Do what you're told.
Hey, Rachel,
what a nice surprise.
I heard you were late.
Again.
I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling too great.
Ah. That's a shame.
Neither am I.
Would you look at this.
Look at this, this crap
I have to take. Hmm?
Yeah.
But I'm never late, am I?
No.
You said that when
I got to 100 grand
you'd give it back to me.
That's the last of it.
And what am I gonna tell the people
that brought you here, Rachel, huh?
You don't know them.
They're...
They're bad news.
Hmm?
Hmm?
You wanna leave us?
You? Queen of the whores?
After all we've been
through together.
Don't we take good care of you?
You do.
We treat you well?
-You do.
-Hmm?
Don't be late again, Rachel.
Ever.
No, no, no, no.
Shh, shh, shh, shh...
And you're mistaken.
It's 150 grand you owe me.
That's the deal.
Have you found anything?
There.
That's no surprise.
Dunquin.
That's here, right?
There's a Dunquin in
County Kerry.
Can you still access the
Irish university's database?
He's dead, Samuel.
They all are.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but see for yourself.
They never found a body.
We need to look to see if he had
any link with the university here.
Doctorates, conferences,
PhDs, anything.
We need to see if we can get
a location on him, uh...
find an address
for him living here.
You better wait after me.
I love you.
Dino, come get it!
Come get it.
Dino?
Dino?
Dino?
Dino?
How the fuck did you
get into my home?
Through the drain pipe.
I can do incredible things.
You better get out
before I call the police.
We want the imago.
What you found in the aquarium.
It belongs to us.
Who the hell are you?
You took it out of the water.
You have to be the one
who gives it back.
Those are the rules.
Get out.
What the fuck have
you done with--
I'll touch
to where possible
after a long grief
and pain.
Tomorrow
before midnight
25 miles along the
road to the north
in Joy Hill
come out
with the imago.
Samuel?
-Sam?
-Shit.
Sam?
Samuel?
-Open the door.
-All right, all right.
-Just a sec. I'm coming!
-Sam?
-What's your problem?
-Sorry, sorry.
Are you okay?
Do you need help?
Yeah, I'm just gonna...
gonna clean it up.
Did you find anything?
You know, you were right.
In the mid 80s, Rauschen left his
chair at Brown to come to Europe.
Did various rotations
at English universities
and then he ended
up here in Cork.
Well, have you got an address
from the file in Cork?
No, they say he lived on campus.
There was an address in Dunquin
which he canceled
right before he quit.
What does it sound like to you?
Sounds to me like
someone who's hiding.
Who's running scared.
Have you got the address?
-You better let me drive.
-No, no, no, no.
-No, I'm going alone.
-What?
-Susan...
-I thought we were in this together.
Susan!
Look at all this. Do you think
this is all a coincidence?
People who get close
to this get hurt!
-I mean it! It's over.
-Okay.
You scare me right now.
Just do as I say, okay?
Good morning.
My name's Samuel Salomon.
I'm from the university.
And I was hoping to...
speak with Professor Rauschen.
The professor died.
I know.
Tell him it's about
the White Ring.
Come in.
My name is Samuel Salomon.
I need to talk to you.
About Lidia.
Lidia Garetti.
How did you find me?
I found this photo
from her house.
Lidia is dead.
She was murdered
three days ago.
What is it you want?
I want you to tell me
what you know.
About her.
About the White Ring.
The fake shipwreck.
What are you hiding from?
Seven ladies there are.
That's what you came here
to talk about, isn't it?
We spent years finding this.
It was an obsession.
What is that?
Lidia recorded this moment.
Just a little... demonstration.
A demonstration of what?
Of what they are.
Wait a second.
Are you suggesting that...
-That Lidia...
-Yes, Mr. Salomon.
She who foretells.
"Thus much and more
"And yet thou lov'st me not
"And never wilt
"Love dwells not in our will
"Nor can I blame thee,
though it be my lot
"To strongly, wrongly,
vainly, love thee still"
What the fuck is that?
It's what they do.
Muses play with words.
And they use poets to infiltrate
our world.
The inspiration.
These verses seem as beautiful
as any other, don't they?
But they're traps.
What is that?
It looks harmless, doesn't it?
But it kills
everything I love.
Friends.
A child.
And then another child.
And then another.
Everything.
Lidia is not your problem.
It's the other ones
you have to worry about.
Give them what they want
as soon as possible.
Do as I say.
I can't.
I don't have what they want.
Then...
Run.
Mom, this one is the biggest,
hardest, and most massive object...
Pack your things.
-We have to go.
-Where?
I don't know. We'll see.
But why? This is our home.
No, baby, it's not.
Please hurry.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
-I um...
-Hey.
We're closed.
Yeah, hi, uh...
I'm wondering if you can help me.
I'm looking for a girl.
Get out.
I don't want any trouble. I just
need to know where I can find...
What's your problem?
It's okay, it's okay.
-Who the fuck are you?
-I'm just looking for a girl.
I think she works here.
Dark hair, green eyes,
Eastern European accent.
Rachel, of course.
Rachel?
You think you're the first one
to come looking for her?
I don't know how she makes you
all lose your fucking minds.
No, no, no, no.
I've never been here before.
I met her a couple of days ago.
We...
Look, I really need to know
where to find her.
I need to talk to her.
Please, it's important.
You're the guy with the dreams.
Have...
She told you about me?
Look, she's in danger.
I just want to try and help her.
Please.
All right.
She lives in one of the apartment
blocks in St. Teresa's Garden.
I think it's the last one.
That's all I know.
Thank you.
-What are you doing?
-Packing.
I meant your clothes,
put your clothes in.
But I can't leave
my stuff here, Mom.
I'll buy you other toys, I promise.
But I don't want other toys.
Just pick one.
Your favorite, yeah?
This one?
No, that's too big.
This one, please?
No, baby, that's even bigger.
Put this on.
You ready?
Come on.
Shh.
Hello, Rachel.
Have you forgotten who
got you this shithole?
Go to the bedroom.
Now! Now! Go!
Very obedient, isn't he?
Didn't get that from you.
What do you want?
I was looking for your passport.
I wanted to um, I wanted
to keep to my word.
But you know what?
I couldn't find it.
Please don't hurt us,
don't hurt my son.
Darling, what do you
take me for, huh?
What do you take me for?
Tonight, I-I come in peace.
Tonight,
you come by the club,
we have a few drinks,
boogie woogie...
It's all forgotten about.
Yeah? Hmm?
First, Rachel, you and I,
we're gonna have a
we're gonna have a
little talk, yeah?
So we can straighten things out.
Please!
Please, please, no!
Fucking figure out how
things work around here.
Hey, boys.
I'm looking for a girl.
She's got short dark hair,
she's very pretty.
Are you a cop?
Do you know her?
You'll do as you're told, Rachel.
You'll fuck whenever I tell ya
or else your son's
gonna get hurt.
And you don't want that, do ya?
Do ya?!
You know now?
You're giving me too
much trouble, Rachel.
And I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
-I und...
-Get in there!
Rachel?
It's Samuel, the guy you
met at Garetti's house.
Rachel?
Rachel, I know you're in there.
Mom?
Rachel, I heard you.
I know you're in there, Rachel.
Rachel?
He tried to kill us.
What?
Help us.
Help us.
Are you a policeman?
No.
You're not the first
person to ask me that.
You think I look
like a policeman?
Mmm, not really.
Do you know what I want
to be when I grow up?
No, what?
A-An astronaut.
Well, or an astronomer.
To go to Jupiter...
on an expedition.
Did you know that they've never
sent anyone to explore it?
Well, maybe they're
waiting to send you.
So you can be the first.
Come on, buddy.
Time for bed.
Is he asleep?
Yeah.
Thank you.
-Listen, that man...
-I don't want to know.
I don't know who
you are, Rachel.
And it's fine.
I just want this.
And I've got it.
But you helped us.
You could've called the police.
You could've...
taken that and just left but
you brought us here.
You're a good man.
I'm a scared man.
That's what I am.
And a little sad.
Why is that so important?
All I know is that
there's someone
willing to do anything
to get it back.
The people who killed Lidia.
Doesn't matter.
That woman wanted us to find it.
I'm certain of it.
She wanted us to find it, great.
We found it.
And now I'm gonna give it back.
End of story.
And then what?
I killed a man.
They're gonna come after me.
Then leave.
I can't.
I have nothing.
I have nowhere to go.
You have your son.
You can still change your life.
What about you?
It's time.
You're not coming back.
Are you?
Stay here.
And don't open the door
to anyone.
-Hello?
-Mr. Salomon, this is Rauschen.
There's something
I didn't tell you.
Lidia sent me a letter
some months ago.
I hadn't heard from her in
years, so I was scared.
I thought there would be
something evil in her words.
Uh, Professor, I appreciate
you calling me, but...
You don't understand.
I think Lidia knew
you were coming to see me.
I think the letter was for you.
Professor, listen, it's over...
Hello again, Professor.
Pro--
Mr. Salomon.
Such a horrible day.
Welcome, Mr. Salomon.
We were expecting you.
Who are you?
She who invokes.
Some people call me Herberia
but it's a bit
pretentious, don't you think?
You can call me Jaqueline.
It's a French name.
Do you like it?
No.
You're an insolent man.
That does not befit a poet.
I am not a poet.
One who gave up writing.
What a waste.
If you only knew what
you were missing.
There's a line by Cavafy
that can produce
blisters filled with pus
and a high fever.
And a very brief Neruda that
explodes like a nuclear plant.
Boom!
Poetry can do incredible things.
I didn't come here
to see party tricks.
No, of course not.
We have matters to
deal with, do we not?
First, you have to
give me your word.
You will not harm us.
You have your own conditions?
You should stop drinking
whiskey, Mr. Salomon.
The girl and the child. No one.
If I give you what you want,
you forget about us
forever.
I want to see it.
Promise...
and I'll give it to you.
I promise.
This is not the imago.
Just a shell.
Did you by any chance come
here to trick us, Mr. Salomon?
Well, someone did. It's obvious.
It seems that girl of yours
is not to be trusted.
Bring us the imago, Mr. Salomon.
But do not expect mercy now.
Samuel?
Rachel, open the door.
Who is it?
You know who I am.
Please open the door,
they can't see me here.
Lidia.
You started to remember.
No, but...
No, that's impossible.
I saw you die.
They had to believe that.
Why?
You still don't remember,
but you will.
My baby?
No. No.
No, it wasn't
because of your baby.
That was an excuse.
It was because of you.
You-You're different.
You've always been different.
You can feel things.
They'll never
be able to feel.
That's why they envy you.
What about you?
I'm with you.
We have a plan.
That's why I'm here.
Do you want to remember?
We're so lucky that
insignificant man came along.
Samuel.
Jaqueline's puzzled.
Doesn't understand what
he has to do with any of it.
You called him.
With the dreams,
like you called... me.
Yes. Right.
How forgetful of me.
Who are you?
Gotcha.
Don't you remember me?
She who lies.
You can tell
I'm out of practice.
What do you want?
You know exactly what I want.
You can't have it.
You can't take it from me.
I remember the rules.
Of course. The rules.
The ones you don't follow.
But that's not why I'm here.
Mom?
Go back to bed, buddy.
Six. Where's the six?
She...who punishes.
I've been expecting you
for a long time.
Secrets must be kept, Professor.
You should have
learned that by now.
Don't exert yourself.
That's Yates.
It won't let you move.
Don't be afraid.
This one is very short.
But it's going to keep
you alive for hours.
We didn't want you to
miss out on anything.
What the fuck?
Six.
What did you do?
What the fuck did you do?
They took my son.
What?
I just wanted that thing.
-Why didn't you give it to me?
-Couldn't.
I remembered.
What are you talking about?
Remembered what?
What I am.
My imago.
Every lady has one.
It's our power.
Our memory.
This is eternity.
Without it, we're just
pieces of flesh.
I've seen them.
And you're not like that.
That's why they hate me.
They hate everything
that seems human
because they'll never
be able to have it.
But I can love.
They've been looking for a chance
to banish me for centuries--
any excuse.
Then it happened.
There are rules.
There are hundreds of rules.
A lady cannot bear children.
It's forbidden.
That gave them a reason.
They could have
just destroyed it
and let me to die like
any human, but no.
They wanted more.
They buried it
and they voided it.
I lost my power.
I forgot everything.
And then they
sold me to that man.
But my eternity would
remain intact.
So the punishment
would never end.
Then Lidia got it back.
She was different too,
in her own way.
She always wanted to help me.
They must've found out somehow
and that's why they killed her.
That can't be.
There is a way.
A ritual.
The White Ring.
Lidia could see the future.
She's been guiding us
from the beginning.
But why me?
Maybe she thought
I needed help.
She would never have chosen me.
I would have chosen you.
"Nor want
"Nor weakness
"Still conspires
"To bind us
"To a sordid state"
What are you?
She who impassions.
Give it to them.
No.
They've won.
They'll do the same
thing to you again.
And they'll kill me,
I'm sure of it.
As long as we have the imago,
they'll keep me alive.
I took it, I have to give it back.
Those are the rules.
This is the only thing
that's protecting us.
What?
Number Seven.
She who hides.
Not even we have seen her.
She's the cruelest,
the most dangerous.
But she's also the weakest.
If she dies, they all die.
That's why she hides.
Where?
The receptacle.
Nobody knows what it is.
Wait.
Lidia.
Maybe she knew.
No, if she wanted to help us,
she would have told us somehow.
Maybe she did.
Makes sense.
Lidia knew they
were watching her.
That's why she was
being so cryptic.
That's why she sent the
letter to Rauschen.
And hid the photo in the frame.
She knew it would
lead you to him.
You better stay here.
Professor?
Hello?
Professor?
Professor?

Professor?
Professor, is that you?
Professor, the letter.
Where is it?
Professor?
Now, listen, listen to me now...
"My heart aches,
"and a drowsy numbness pains"
Do you think they know
about the letter?
No, they they would
have taken it.
A key?
"They are all gone into
the world of light
"And I alone sit ling’ring here
"Their very memory
is fair and bright,
"And my sad thoughts
doth clear."
My sad thoughts doth clear.
My sad thoughts doth clear.
It's Milton. I'm sure of it.
-It has to mean something.
-I don't know.
But I know someone who will.
It's open.
Oh, fuck.
Susan?
Susan?
Oh, my God!
Susan, stop that!
Oh, fuck.
Fucking hell, what
have they done to you?
When did they do this to you?
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
Dammit! Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop!
What does it mean?
She's gonna devour herself.
Well, there must be some
way we can stop it!
There's nothing we can do.
You stopped the nurse,
maybe you can do it.
I didn't stop the nurse.
I killed him.
Do you want me to do that now?
Maybe we can cut it out!
-What?
-Go get a knife!
I don't think that'll work.
Down to the kitchen at
the end of the hallway.
Bring whatever you can find.
No!
Susan, please, stop it!
Stop it!
Rachel! Hurry, please!
Rachel!
I can't.
Help me put her on her back.
Hold her hand,
don't let her touch it.
Take her hands, hold her hands.
Are you sure about this?
No!
We're gonna have to
tie her down.
Stop her hurting herself.
Find us something to tie...
Tie her up.
I'm not gonna hurt you,
but I'm gonna have to stop you
from doing this to yourself, all right?
I'm so sorry...
I got it, I got it!
All right.
-Turn her round.
-Give me her hand.
All right, that's good.
Get it, get it.
We're gonna get you onto the
bed now, you'll be okay up there.
All right, shh now...
Here we go.
Shh...shh...
Okay.
All right.
Shh, shh, shh...
Try to breathe.
Breathe...
Breathe.
We have to call an ambulance.
They'll take her to a hospital.
They'll try to remove it.
They won't.
They don't know what it is.
As soon as she's free,
she'll start doing it again
and she won't stop. I'm sorry.
What if they keep her safe?
What if they sedate
her or something?
She can still help us.
You have to show her the verse.
They have my son.
You have no idea what
they're capable of. Please.
Call an ambulance.
Susan...
I'm-I'm sorry to have to ask you
this, but I need your help.
I need you to tell me
what this means.
"They are all gone into
the world of light
"And I alone sit ling’ring here
"Their very memory
is fair and bright,
"And my sad thoughts
doth clear."
It's Milton, isn't it?
-You're the expert, you tell me...
-No.
No.
Not Milton.
What?
Vaughan.
People mistake that...
The poem, Susan,
what does it mean?
-What does it...?
-Let me go.
-Let me go.
-Susan, please.
-I'm sorry.
-Let me go.
-Let me go.
-I'm sorry.
The poem, what does it mean?
Beyond the veil.
Susan?
They won't be long.
What'd she tell you?
Nothing.
Beyond the veil, is the
title of the poem?
Why didn't she just
write down an address?
If she wanted to tell us.
Wait, beyond the veil.
She did.
Bortrane Lunatic Asylum.
Room 1007.
This is the place.
It's indelible ink.
Lidia sent the letter from
there six months ago.
But it's been closed for years.
We have to go. Now.
No, no, no. We have to
wait for the ambulance.
We can't leave Susan like this.
She's my friend.
Then I'll wait outside.
There's an ambulance
on it's way.
They'll be here any minute.
Do you hear me, Susan?
Everything will be
just as before.
I promise.
I'll come back to the
university like you wanted.
I think I can help her.
I'm remembering.
How?
I'm not sure but I can try.
Leave me alone with her.
Okay.
Susan!
Got you.
I wouldn't go in there if
I were you, Mr. Salomon.
You won't like it.
No!
I want to hurt them.
I want them to fucking die.
The receptacle.
Whatever it is,
it has to be in there.
That's where she's hiding.
We'll have to be ready.
What happens when she dies?
They all will.
And you?
My son will live.
We have to hurry.
Won't take them long to find us.
Room 1007.
1000.
1006.
-Seven.
-Seven.
Stand back here.
There's nothing in here.
It has to be.
The message is clear.
-What if you're wrong?
-No.
No, no, no, no.
Promise.
Will.
Love.
Forever.
Promise you'll love forever.
What's wrong?
What is that?
It's you.
What is it?
The receptacle.
It's you.
What?
She's...
She's inside you.
Lidia knew it.
You were the only piece
out of place.
Now everything fits.
No.
-Samuel.
-No.
Samuel?
Face it, Samuel. Tell me.
Think about how you met her.
How she appeared in your life.
It was all part of a plan.
Stop!
She made you fall in love
with here, didn't she?
And then she left.
Why?
Because she knew...you'll
never be able to forget her.
You were the perfect
hiding place.
No!
No!
She's inside you, Samuel.
She's in your heart.
I want to get her
out of my heart!
I know how to do that.
But you have to tell me
how it happened.
You have chosen well, Rachel.
The saddest of all stages
for the saddest of all endings.
What is this place?
It's here.
It has to happen here.
What is it?
Lidia.
What are you looking for?
It's perfect.
What are you doing?
Help me.
Tear this off.
The White Ring.
Come on.
I'm gonna need you now.
Follow me.
What do you need me to do?
We'll trick her.
We have to smoke her out.
Yes.
Take off your coat.
If the receptacle is in danger...
If your body is hurt...
she'll be forced to come out.
Give me your arm.
We'll have to be quick.
When she comes out, she'll
sense that she's in danger
and she'll turn violent.
We have to put her in the circle.
That will immobilize her.
And that will be the moment.
Samuel,
you’re gonna have to kill her.
There's no other way.
Oh, fuck.
I don't want you to die.
Promise me.
You'll take care of my son.
Always.
Promise me you'll love him.
Please.
She's running.
She's coming.
She's coming.
Samuel.
You have to hang on.
Please.
Please, please please.
Hang on, please.
I have no wit,
I have no words,
I have no tears,
No tears.
Bring the boy.
Samuel?
Don't listen to her.
Kill her.
She's lying to you, Samuel.
She has no idea what we were.
Don't listen to her.
Kill her.
Look at me, Samuel.
It's me, Samuel.
Don't you remember?
Kill her.
No, don't do it, no!
Kill her.
No, don't listen to her, please.
Do it!
My love.
You're not Beatriz.
-No, don't say that.
-You are not Beatriz.
She was alive.
And my love, it's not that simple.
I'm a lot of things
at the same time.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
She's lying to you.
She's lying to you.
Kill her.
Look at me.
I could have chosen anyone.
She's lying.
But I chose you.
Do you know why?
Do it. Do it. Kill her.
Because I loved you.
No, no, no, no no.
-You know it.
-No. No.
She's lying. Look at me.
You promised.
Do you remember,
you promised me?
You will love me forever.
What?
-What?
-Kill her.
Kill her!
I must admit.
I didn't think you'd
get this far, Rachel.
Mom?
Oh, babe...
Please.
Let him go.
No, Rachel.
The rules are different.
You let her go
and your son will
live a little longer.
We've come for the
imago, remember?
He will never give it to you.
I don't think he'll
have much choice.
The end of this story
has already been written.
Give us the imago
and we can turn the page.
Mom!
Mom!
Accept your fate, Rachel.
I have incredible plans for you.
Samuel, don't do it.
Shhh...
You see?
You can't do it.
You won't want to leave your son
alone
in this mediocre world.
That wouldn't be a good end
for this story, would it?
I can't think...of a better one.
Kill her.
Now.
This is how that story ends.
The saddest story of them all.
And like all stories,
one day,
it will be forgotten.
All that will remain
will be a trace of black ink
on a piece of paper.
But I know it was real.
I know she was real.
Sam?
And I know that one day,
we will find a way
to bring her back.
Poetry
can do incredible things.
