Gentlemen...
-Hello, sir.
Oh ! ...Did I tell you ,during our last session ...
...of the codicil... suspended  by  your mother ?...
No.
-No, Why ? Is there something more ?
Well...following the  codicil, Is not the donator
stipulates expressively that after a delay
of two years after the death...
...If the inheritance candidates did not come forward,
the total amount was gained by the state
of Texas for the creation of an orphanage.
But your brave mother,
who I salute,...
...Left us 2 years ago...
...and 2 days...
On the other hand, for what is the second gain,
no problem, it is yours...
...it's a nice disk recorded
by your mother...
...On which you will pay no inheritance tax,...
I'll just add that concerning the fee,...
...notary expenses plus agency fee,
The total amount comes up to  13 250 francs
Let's round it up to 13 000 Fr .
There , You sign here !
hum... Sorry but I didn't get it...
The 13 000 hum...Is that all we get ?
Uh...no, no... Those are
the compensatory emoluments...
Uh... Sorry but... Where is the inheritance ?
-The 100 potatoes ?
I just told you...Following the codicil
suspended by your mother...
Sorry but...Can you explain yourself clearly
because I'm not really getting it...
Well 2 days ago...
-Yes ?
The inheritance...
-Yes ?
Was still yours...
-Yes ?
And Today... it happens that the usufruct of
your share has been entirely divided ...
Excuse me, but I just don't understand
that thing about the fruit juice ...
Usufruct.
-What is it ? What does it mean ?
Clearly, because we don't understand.
The usufruct of you entire share divided...
What's wrong with you ?!!
Sorry , It slipped, because
I don't understand...
Me neither, I don't understand.

-Yes.
Let's just say. there's no more inheritance.
Oh no ! Oh no that's not possible !How do I deal
with the car What do I do with Lulu ?

the money and today it's over ?
We don't have it ?

Are you crazy ! Those things are dangerous  !
-An acid !Dangerous ! Where did you hear that?
-But we'll be noticed !
The only people that get noticed here
are the ones that didn't take anything !
And anyway, as long as we don't solution the production tool,
we won't solution anything !That's it !
I agree, but I think, that we have to reposition
the whole logic of the company...
...If we want to simplify the synergy hyper faces, no?
-He is totally right !
Tchuss !
Bernard, Wait !
And that  ? What you got  ?
- What you want !
I have pyramids, Bart Simpsons,
Trolls...
Kangaroos.

Yes...The problem in France is that
everybody talks and nobody moves !
Talking about moving...

your eggs in the same basket, right...

200 grands in the company would be good !
What do you say?
-Uh... yeah...it's..interesting ...
Somebody want more sushi  ?
Come on let go, you'll see it'll come !
-If I let go, I'm going !

Ok where's the Casanova ?!
I'm here .
Oh you’re here .
Is it ok if I pay you cash ?
no, no...
You'll be in the next take ?
Yes it's exactly what the
customer is looking for...good resume...
...nothing to say about
your qualifications,...
...the only thing ,...is that you
are actually without a job.
Well...uh...that's
why I'm here ..
I understand, but for the customer, the term...
..."job seeker" has a
negative connotation...
I understand, but we have to be logical,
If I had a job, I wouldn't be looking for one...
You know logic these days...
I'll go get hired somewhere
else and I'll come back later..
And here it's a cata, it's a cata,...

"Hello" said Fox,...
"Hello" politely replied the Little Prince , ...
"Who are you ?",...
"I'm a Fox", said the Fox,...
"Come play with me !" proposed the Little Prince,...
"I'm so sad"
"I cannot play with you" said the Fox,...
"I'm not tamed"
"Oh sorry" replied the Little Prince,
"What does "tamed" mean " ?,...
"It's something often forgotten" said the Fox,...
"It means building relationships"
"Building relationships ?"
"Yes !", said the Fox,...
" You are still for me a little boy
just like 100 000 other little boys"
"...and I don't need you
and you don't need me either."
"I am just for you a fox
just like 100 000 others..."
"...but if you tame me
we will need one each other."
"You will be for me a unique, ..."
"...And I will be for you unique ."
Continue reading .
"The wheat fields don't remind me of anything",...
"...this is sad,..."
"...but you have golden hair."
More !
So the Little Prince tamed the Fox.
And when the time to go arrived...
And the time to go was close...
"Ah !" said the Fox, "I will cry !",...
"It's your fault" said the Little Prince,
"I did not wish no harm, but you wanted me..."
"...to tame you."
"of course" said the Fox,
"But are you going to cry ?" asked the Little Prince
"Of course !" said the Fox
"So you don't gain anything ?"
"I do..." said the Fox,
"...because of the color of the wheat."
This is all bullshit.
All bullshit.
Are you pregnant ?

But do you have a good
relation with Mr. Latour ?
Of course, Mr. President !
I've even proposed him an interesting...
...promotion.
But you fired him ?
Yes. You know Mr., President,...
...A company is sort of like...
a blimp.
A washing machine...
...if you want it to work...
...you have to take out some dirty laundry !
...Laundry, I mean...
Yeah yeah ! Just say that we're like stains !!!
What, we're like stains and
what are you going to do ?!!
You’re going to put some..
"UNSTAIN ITALL" on us ?!!
Vanilla stain, chocolate stain ?!!!
And you think it's going to be a mimi,
a rara...
It's going to be a... ???
...a miracle !

It's not because you wipe off the stains ....
...that they leave !!!
And it will always be a caca, a cata, a... ?!!!
...A catastrophe !!
Because I'll tell you where the problem is... !!!
...the problem Mr. President,
is not the stains... !!!
...it's the ones who make them !!!
Not bad, right ?
That was good !
Yes, they even put a pair
of underwear on my head !
Look, like this !!!
Yeah, yeah, it makes you laugh ?!!!
You have to admit, Sir,
that we don't have an easy job ?!!!
Especially when your
clients react this way  ?!!!
You can see, Mr. President,
that these bruises are tenacious !
Wait..., that has nothing to do with it...
it's a litigation with a client...
...yesterday, well...
What ?!!! So what ?!!! And I'm bailiff !!!
I'm protected !!!
Yes I'm protected !!!
I'm protected sir !!!
Yes because what does "protected" mean... ?!!!
It means that we can steal...
...and that we can be
pardoned just like that ?!!!
Just wait !!!
For me "protected"....
...you want me to tell you what it means ?!!!
It means "Fat....
...no, no... he's protected too...
...fat....
...fat...
...It uh fat...
fatefully means...
...that we should be worthy of our protection,...
...Sir...
...Like you...
...and like you Ms. prosecutor...

A great talent ! A professional !
A great actor, Mr. President !!!
I don't know if you've seen the movie...
...No... it's ok !...
...He takes Ingrid an d Pam !!! Wow !!!
Don't laugh !!! I swear !!!
Where are our morals , Mr. President?!!!,...
...France is in bad shape !!!,...
...bathing in their own contaminated water !!!,...
...just like my future son in law was...
...by his bad company !
bad company ?
Well yeah, an acrobat...
Uh...sorry but, we say comedian !
Mr. Rougemond, please continue.
So you were saying ... a comedian and..
... uh... well... uh... you see what I mean ?
Well say it, go ahead !!!
I know what he's thinking !!
Come on, tell me !!!
Say it !!!
It's nigger !!!
That's what he wanted to see Mr. President !
I know him well !
Nigger !!! Right ?!!
Yeah...Well you said it !...Not me...
It's like this since I'm little,
Mr. President !
And I’ve seen a lot !
So now I'm saying it out loud :
Yes I am Black and I am Proud !!!
And I'm talking to all the oppressed...
...all the outcasts,...
...Yes brothers !!!,...
...we must continue the fight !!!
...like once said the philosopher,
Timothy Gustave,...
...Our Montaigne !!!,...
...brothers, yes brothers !!!...
...cultivate no less,
difference the same !!!...
...We must cultivate our difference
and not indifference !!!
Bravo !
Who's Augustave whatever  ?
I don't know.
I don't know what to think ,
Mr. President...
Michael is not the same.
We can imagine, unfortunately...
no, no, no, I mean...
He eats better, sleeps better !
...and...he laughs.
Ok, I have to admit that his language is a little...
particular at times...
But he seems so happy...
...I'm even asking myself if we haven’t made a mistake...
Listen, that's up to you.
Uh...ok. Nothing to add ?
No.
But maybe to undo.
If possible...
Undo ?
Yes. My complaint against them, Mr. President...
Thank you Miss. You may go.
Thank you.
No no... No, no. no !!!
I’m responsible !!!
Yes !!! I'm guilty !!!
Yes, it's me !!!
Me too, it's me !
Yes, it's me, Mr. President !
I’ve just realized...
Christine, wait !!!
I'm the one who's responsible.
I played her, I played an orphan,
I...
...I thought I was a philosopher,...
...Only listening to myself, I...
We don't care about others ! That's what happens !
What ? What are you saying ?
Where are you going with this ?
uh no...I just...
... I just want justice to be served...
Because when we don't have our parents,
There are no laws to...
...to bring them back to Earth.
But, when a kid has
his mother and father,...
...Well there ...,
...There are laws to take them away...
And that would be it.
Holy shit !
Crap !
You should of been a lawyer !!!
No cursing !
So you say that Justice is not made well...
...and I will remind you, Mr. President,
that one of his claims...
...is to be the father of this child !
well, nothing proves that ?!!
It's my daddy ! It's my daddy !
It's my daddy ! It's my daddy !
Because of my but !!!
It's my kid !!!
The sitting is suspended !
"Dear daddy,
...dear uncle,...
...I am very happy because...
...I will see you soon...
...The little Juliette is growing...
...She's over nice !
...Mommy is not here .She works a lot...
...but Mary takes care of me...
...See you soon...
We send you 100 million Kissy kissy kissy kisses."

P.S. I'm behave well...
...And I hope that you behaved well too...
...and that you don't do any bad things.
Hey, the three kings !!! Hurry, it's going to get cold !!!
Would of preferred jail to this place  !
And why is he calling us the Three Kings ?
Come on Balthazar, don't try to understand !
CS is for "Community service" !
It doesn't mean to be lazy !
He's really getting on my nerves !
guys please !
Just 2 months to go !
And in the meantime, we should
try to find a father for Juliette ?
Why are you saying that ?
I don't know... I could commit,
for her balance !
What a balance !
And you're gonna put acid
in her oatmeal for her growth ?!!
Are you kidding ?!
No ! I think I'm the ideal guy for her !
I already have a child, experience...
I have no kids, but I have a career path.
Mary...
Mary...She needs a man like me !
I thought your ideal woman was
Michelle Pfeiffer on top...
...Kim Basinger in the middle, ...
...Aunt Jemima on the bottom...

She won't have a daddy !
Or 3 daddies.
There . And anyway,
it's so crowded today...
