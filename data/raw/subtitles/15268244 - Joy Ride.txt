Why don't you look

'Cause I'm adopted from China.
That's why I have a birth mom.
I'd be so mad
if my parents gave me up.

You close ChinaWave this week,
I'm puttin' you up for partner.

Well, come on,
Ms. 3,000-Billable-Hours,
you knew this was coming.
You know, if this works out,
you're gonna have
to move out to L.A.,
work out of headquarters.
That'd be amazing, actually.
You know, I've been thinking
it'd be nice to have a change.
-Oh, you're gonna love LA.
-Yeah.
I mean, there's a Chinatown,
a Thai Town, a Koreatown.
-I mean, it's basically Asia.
-Sure.
-(KEVIN GROANS)

It's a big account. Good thing
you're fluent in Chinese.
-(ZIPS BAG)

Since we're goin' to Beijing,
I slid in his DMs.
He's learning the language,

If you need help translating,
I talked to Kat,

This is chaotic.
That's what my art is
all about. Inspiring chaos.
Challenging fetishes that
Asian people have to deal with
around sexuality.
I mean, it's just a lot.
I hope someone likes it.
I could really use
a commission right now.
If you really need money,
you could pick up
some shifts here.
Your parents need the help.
I'm not tryin'
to be a sell-out.
-I'm a starving artist.
-Mmm.
I could bring one
of my pieces to Beijing.
Lolo, this is such
an important work...
-Work trip. Work trip.
-Right.
-Or... And just hear me out.
-No. No. No "or."
What if it's our first annual
best friends trip? You and me.
Romy and Michele.
Bert and Elmo.
-Ernie.
-Oh, my God,
I'm so embarrassed.
I love the idea
of an annual trip
but you're gonna have
to save some money.
-Yeah.
-You're saving money
by living with me.
And I'm so grateful.
And it's been really fun
but I don't know,
like, maybe I don't wanna live
in White Hills my whole life.
Why not? This is home.
Right, but...
Lolo... we told you to stop
bringing your art in here.
I ran out of space at Audrey's.
Put it away.

AUDREY: Guys, you didn't have
to throw a whole party.
We're gonna be back in,
like, four days.
We wanted to give you a nice
send-off. It's a big deal.
Going to your birth country.
It's a business trip.
And it's so great
you're taking Lolo with you.
-Anyway, we brought
Hong Dou Bing.
-Oh, yes.
-These are red bean buns.
-ALL: Ooh.
-MARY: Red bean.
-Audrey first.
-Thank you so much.
They look so good.
-JENNY: Yes.
JENNY: You got the blue one.
Those are special.
Will I like these?
No, no. Probably not,
to be honest.
-You're basically white.
-That's not true.
You have a throw pillow
that says, "Wine o'clock."
-Rose all day.
-You own a picnic basket.
They're very useful.
Name every character

Logan, Kendall, Shiv, Roman...
Oh, you got me.
So, I thought it would be fun
to look at some photos

she was in China.
Oh, my gosh. No. The Chens
don't wanna look at that.
-That's for us.
-Yes.
-No, I...
-(LOLO GASPS)
-Oh.
-Oh, honey, look,
this is the first time

-JOE: Oh, God.
-Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.
-So am I.
-No, I know. It's cute.
-LOLO: Who's this?
MARY: Look at that
head of hair.
Oh. Oh, that's my birth mom.
How have you never
shown me this?
I don't know.
It's not a big deal.
-MARY: Who was that actor?
-JOE: Yeah, she...
Your adoption agency's
on the back.
Yeah. (READING IN MANDARIN)
(IN ENGLISH) Should we call them
and maybe get
-information on your mom?
-No. I don't wanna do that.
I mean, we used to talk
about it all the time
when we were little, remember?
A grand adventure
to find your birth mom?
No. No. That was
because we were kids.
And we're adults now.
We've moved on.
At least I have, okay?
So let's not do that.
Anyway, why would
I need more parents
when I have the two best
parents in the world?
-Aw, honey.
-Oh, we love you, sweetie.
-You're the best.

-Yeah. Uh...
-Yeah. Let's fucking go!
Yeah, you're evens, okay?
Uh, you got this.
Close this fucking deal.
-(BURPS)
-That's my bitch!
(CHAO SPEAKING MANDARIN)
(CHANTING IN MANDARIN)
I won? I won! I won, right?
I won!
-(AUDREY EXCLAIMING)
-(ALL CHEERING)
I won! I won!
-LOLO: (CHANTING) Audrey!
-(CHAO GRUNTS)
-(BAR FALLS SILENT)
-(CROWD EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)
(CROWD MURMURING)
(WHISPERING) Oh, shit.
(CHANTING)
Audrey! Audrey! Yes!
You just nailed him
like Mike fuckin' Tyson!
I'm so sorry.
(IN MANDARIN)
Oh, no, you're good.
-AUDREY: Did I hit him?
-Yeah, yeah, he's fine.
-(CROWD CHEERING)
-Yeah! Yeah!
I'm just gonna... Yeah!
-(RETCHES)
-(CROWD GASPS LOUDLY)
I'm so, so fucked.
No, no, you're good.
AUDREY: Oh, thank God for Kat.
Look at her.
Chunhwa just schmoozing
with those businessmen,
salvaging our night.
God. I love her.
-God, I'm gonna be sick again.
-I'll get you a ginger ale.
Get me a new face or stomach,
or something.
-(IN ENGLISH)
Are you feeling better?
-I'm so sorry.
I... I usually don't, um,
have eggs like that and...
Wait. Uh.
Do you speak English?
Many Chinese people
speak English.
But most Americans
do not speak Chinese.
It's always fun to pretend.
By the way, I appreciate that
you would want to smash this.
Oh. (CHUCKLES) Well, I would.
I'd smash it really...
I can see it's your first time
in China.
Yeah. You know what? I'm...
I'm usually not like this.
I'm... I'm so sorry, I got sick.
But I'm... I'm very ready
to go over the terms
of our business proposal.
You know,
there's a saying in Chinese.
(IN MANDARIN)
(IN ENGLISH) It means,
you can tell a lot
about a person
by their family.
Do you have any relatives
in China?
Oh, uh, yeah, well, probably.
Uh, sure, yes.
Definitely, probably.
Um, I... I was adopted, so...
Oh, well, if you do not know
where you come from,
how do you know who you are?
Oh, God. (CHUCKLES) No, no,
I know where I'm from.
Actually, you know, I was
born here, but I am American.
So, you have no contact
with your Chinese family.
(SIGHS) That's a shame.
(IN MANDARIN)
(CHUCKLES) Uh...
What? What'd he say?
Well, she's actually really
close with her birth mother.
-Yeah. Like that.
-CHAO: Oh.
-(IN ENGLISH) Really?
-Yeah, yeah.
We're actually meeting up
with her this week.
(CHAO SPEAKING MANDARIN)
(IN ENGLISH)
My mother is celebrating
her 70th birthday this Friday.
-Oh, wow.
-It's gonna be a big event.
Her favorite performer's
gonna be there. DJ Tiesto.
We're gonna have gift bags,
oranges, Teslas,
Bitcoin, that kinda thing.
I would love for you to come.
Bring your mother.
My mother? Um, no... Oh...
Oh, you know what,
uh, we couldn't impose.
-No, no, I insist.
-You insist. He insists.
-Oh, yeah. This one.
-How are we supposed
to do business together
if we do not know
each other's families?
We can't do business
if we don't...
Come to the event,
and we'll close the deal there.
-Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
-(IN MANDARIN)
(BOTH MOUTHING)
(IN ENGLISH) Oh. Finally.
We'll be there.
It's... It's a mom party.
So, it's settled then.
(TOASTING IN MANDARIN)
I... Just give me a minute.
(GAGS)
(RETCHES)
LOLO: Hell yeah,
I'm not okay. (GROANS)
AUDREY: I can't feel my face.
Oh, fuck. (INHALES SHARPLY)
Fuck. That went
so fucking terribly.
Not to me. Uh, I feel closer
to you than ever.
-Oh, my God.
-DEADEYE: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, no, no, no. I'm good.
I'm good. Deadeye, I'm so...
I'm so sorry again that
I threw up on you. We got...
We better clean you up.
Okay, I... I'll find something.
(AUDREY SIGHS)
See, I knew
this was gonna happen
if I brought you on
this business trip, Lolo.
You're always doing
shit like this.
What about a "thank you?"
I mean, you were
sinking in there,
and I saved your ass.
Well, whatever you were doing,
you failed.
AUDREY: This is my job.
Why would you lie and tell
Chao that I knew my birth mom?
-That's insane.
-That is insane.
Are you her echo? Who the fuck
asked for your opinion?
Well, what do you expect
her to do now?
She could go find
her birth mom.
Just like we always said
we would.
AUDREY: That was hypothetical.
We don't even know
where she is.
What, you want me to search
all of China?
-DEADEYE: Give it to me!
-(WATER GUSHING)
-Great.
-So, the other day,
I may have called
the adoption agency
and pretended to be you.
-What are you talking about?
-KAT: Wow!
Apparently,
at the time of adoption
she agreed to be contacted.
She's open to meeting you.
Her address is on there.
She lives in Haiching,
which is super close
to Nai Nai's.
And we'll just stay with them.
Oh, no, no, no.
She can't handle it!
Wait, no. Why not?
I can handle it.
Nai Nai's like,
Chinese-Chinese.
Like, "super long hair
coming out of a mole
"and refuses to pluck it
'cause it's bad luck" Chinese.
"Forces you to overeat,
"and then comments
on your weight later" Chinese.
Like, literally,
"take her bra off,
wipe her under-boob sweat
"in the middle of
a Buddhist temple
"and make you sniff it" Chinese.
"Has a plastic bag full of
other plastic bags" Chinese.
Don't act like
you know my family.
You don't know
what we've been through.
Look at Deadeye!
Look at me! Look at me!
LOLO: It'll be fine.
We'll take the train and...
And go straight to Haiching
and we'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.
And I'm gonna close this deal.
And it'd be really nice
to meet your birth mother.
Okay.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Okay, will you guys
come with me?
Fuck yes, bitch.
-I'm here for you, Audrey.
-Oh, my God, thank you.
-LOLO: Really?
-I love a grand adventure.
-(MOCKS SILENTLY)
-Thank you. Thank you. Okay.
Okay, so were gonna go
to Haiching.
Okay, all right. Yeah,
we're doin' it. We're doin' it.
-Haiching, baby!
-Yes!
(SHOUTS IN MANDARIN)
Guys, guys, I'm a boy.
(LAUGHS)
AUDREY: Just so you guys know,
I have extra cash
in my money belt.
And also, our passports
are in there too.
-Why are you being paranoid?
-KAT: Don't worry.
I've got locks on my bag.
Just put it in here.
-Really?
-Of course.
AUDREY: Okay. Make sure your
bags are zipped at all times.
See? Zip it. Zip it. Zip it.
We're in China.
It's the safest place
in the world.
I heard that if you're short,
you'll get kidnapped to go
live on a gymnastics farm.
That's not a thing.
All I'm saying is
that as foreigners,
we need to be extra vigilant,
okay?
Just keep our heads on
a swivel. And watch what
-we eat and what we drink.
-Ooh, good call.
-Let's get some snacks.
-Nom, nom, nom.
-Squid on a stick.
-Okay.
Just come back here, okay?
-We have eight minutes.
-KAT: Okay, guess what?
Remember when I told you
I auditioned for that movie?
Sweet Home Orange County?
-Well, I got the part.
-You what?
I'm gonna be in LA next summer.
Oh, congratulations.
Isn't there a chance
you're gonna be in LA too?
Yeah. (LAUGHS)
-Hotties in La La Land!
-See,
this is why I have to close
this deal and make partner.
KAT: It's gonna be so amazing
to have a friend there.
I mean, you really...
(CLEARS THROAT)
You really know me.
-Yeah, I know.
-You've seen a lot.
I've seen a little too much.
(GIGGLES)
Do you think it's okay that
I haven't told Clarence
everything about
my past and...
Yeah, no, it's totally okay.
I mean, hey, can you...
-Okay.
-...not mention LA to Lolo?
I haven't really told her
about it yet.
Is there an issue there?
AUDREY: Yeah, no, I mean,
I'll tell her eventually.
But, uh, you know, she doesn't
have as much going on as I do.
(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT
THROUGH SPEAKERS)
(LOLO LAUGHS)
And I,
I just think it might be
great to have some space.
(CLICKS TONGUE) I get it.
It's between you and me.
-Thank you. Zip.
-Zip.
Where do we sit?
LOLO: Find any car
with open seats.
(APOLOGIZES IN MANDARIN)
(IN ENGLISH)
Those guys look shady.
-LOLO: Oh, there's room here.
-I'm not really...
We'd have to squeeze.
I hate the smell of oranges.
Oh, hi, um, is anyone else
sitting here with you?
No. Sorry. No.
They're not sitting here.
Oh, amazing. Hey, guys!
Guys, guys, come on.
I found one.
It's so nice
to see an American.
Where are you visiting from?
Oh, um,
I actually live in Beijing.
No way. She lives here.
JESS: Yeah.
I moved here, like,
I wanna say, five years ago.
I love it.
Also, looking like me here
-I get so much attention.
-Totally.
Asian people with me,
it's just... They've...
I... I'm Gisele.
AUDREY: Yeah.
So, you like living here?
I love it.
The people are great,
the food's incredible.
And it's safe.
Is it safe?
Because, I... I mean,
I just, I hear there's a lot
of pickpockets here, right?
And Chinese youths
are getting really into drugs.
Fuck yeah, they are.
(GASPS) Chinese kids
are cool as fuck.
They fucking party.
You can get anything
you want here.
I... It's...
It's so unbelievable.
I mean, anything you want.
China White, benzos,
bush, kush.
Uh, just curious,
what do you do for work?
-Hmm?
-Mmm?
Oh, I do import. I do import
-and then I... I also do export.
-That's so cool.
So like, like furniture?
Sure.
I have my period.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
(COUGHS) Oh, shit.
I'm bleeding.
(JESS GRUNTS)
Fuck.
-Oh, my God. She's so sweet!
-Are you serious?
-That bitch is so suspicious.
-What are you talking about?
-She's super nice.
-Okay, I know you chose her
because she's American
varsity blue corn-fed bitch,
but, like, no!
No, she's totally sus!
There's something
-wrong with her.
-Yeah, you're not my favorite,
-but I do agree.
-JESS: Shit! Fuck!
-Hey, are you...
-Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
-(SLAMS DOOR SHUT)
-AUDREY: Are you okay?
Pox is gonna kill me.
-I know it's hot in here.
-JESS: Fuck!
-You can't open that window.
-What are you looking at?
There's nothing
to fucking see here.
Don't look at me like that.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
-(POLICE OFFICER
SPEAKING MANDARIN)
-What is that?
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
It's the cops.
They're doing a bag check.
Um, yeah, there's a drug
dealer on the train.
-Oh, fuck!
-Who do we think it is?
The family with the oranges?
Audrey, get a fucking grip!
It's this bitch.
Oh, my God!
You're a drug dealer?
Of course, I am. I was trying
to sell you drugs.
Okay, you need
to get rid of that now.
Get rid of it.
We need to get rid of that.
'Cause if I'm going down,
you little dipshits
are going down with me.
We're American. They're gonna
come after all of us.
If the cops ask, we'll just
say we have nothing to do
-with her.
-(BLOWS)
(DEADEYE SCREAMS)
You're drug dealers now,
bitches!
LOLO: What the fuck?
Okay, that is good shit,
by the way.
Yeah, I only sell the best.
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-(DEADEYE SCREAMING)
LOLO: Oh, fuck. Fuck.
-KAT: No, no, no.
-Oh, shit.
We can't get caught
with drugs in China.
We'll get deported.
Or jail, probably for life.
Oh, my God, is this what
happened in Brokedown Palace?
That was Thailand!
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna get disbarred.
I am too famous for jail.
You guys need to
calm the fuck down
and you need to fuckin'
listen to me, okay?
Since that window's
not working,
we have two options.
We hide the drugs in our body,
or we do them, okay?
I need your help.
You look like you've done
a lot of drugs.
-That's correct.
-You look like you've
had a lot of things
in your asshole.
Uh, not a lot of things.
Just one thing.
But maybe different varieties
of that one thing,
um, which is dick. I mean,
no, no! (INHALES)
You don't understand.
Cocaine makes me really horny.
-It could get really weird.
-I know you two aren't
drug people and I know
you're super scared right now
but you're gonna
need to decide.
Are you gonna step up
for your fellow countrywoman?
You gonna plug
or you gonna play?
No. Neither.

I'm not ready to have sex!

I got it. I got it, guys.
I got it, got it.
Attention, Chinese policemen.
Oh, shit.
You're about to get lawyered.
Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi.
I know that you think
that we have drugs,
and we do not have drugs.
In fact, I'm a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer. I'm in fact,
a very good lawyer.
And so I just
want you to know that
we are citizens of Amer...
America.
And that is why
I rest my case.
-Bonk! Bonk!
-Mmm.

(BOTH ARGUING IN MANDARIN)

Okay, okay. We're good,
we're good, we're good,
we're good. Okay.
Every... Everybody, calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
Oh, my God! What the fuck?
That American girl stole
Kat's suitcase.
Our passports are in there.
Well, the bright side is,
we just got
kicked off the train.
We're not hanging by our
nipples in a meat freezer.
No, no, no, no. If we do not
have our passports,
then we can't go home.
And if we can't go home,
then we can't go to our jobs.
And if we don't have jobs,
we can't get more money
to get more coke.
I want more coke. Oh, my God.
Is anyone else itchy?
I'm sorry. I'm just,
I'm fucking itchy.
Fuck. Fuck.
Kat, honey, you good?
-Are they coming out?
-Yeah, but only seven.
-And I think I put in eight.
-If you get a clean one
could you just, um,
keep me posted?
I hate you so much right now!
Just push. Pull.
I mean, twist it.
It's not a Bop It,
it's my asshole!
Okay, just stick
your hand up there
like a claw machine tryin'
to get the stuffed bear.
-Okay.
-Deeper!
-KAT: Okay.
-Higher!
-Okay!
-Get that bear!
I'm getting the bear!
-(ROARING)
-How are you so normal?
You did, like, twice as much
stuff as the rest of us.
I think all the coke and molly
just balanced out my system.
I just feel good.
Like, "just watched a child
"fall through
a manhole cover" good.
(LAUGHING) You deserve it,
little shit.
You're a beautiful
silk kimono.
Is this a hot dog on a stick?
You know what?
Maybe I just miscounted.
It's probably seven.
(WHIMPERS)
(MUFFLED COUGHS, SCREAMS)
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)
Deadeye! If you find coke,
come back!
Guys, how have
we walked for hours
and haven't seen one car?
LOLO: It's all good.
I DM'd Baron Davis.
Fuck. The next town
is 27 kilometers away.
My basketball boo
is on his way, okay?
(CHUCKLES)
Oh. Although, at this point,
I don't even wanna be
rescued, okay?
I cannot be seen in public
-looking like this.
-(LOLO CHUCKLES)
Yeah, you look like
Hello Kitty
just got skull-fucked
by Grobie.
(LAUGHING) Oh, my God,
you're so funny!
-Fuck you!
-(CHUCKLES)
This is all your fault.
How is it my fault?
I'm not the one who
chose the train cabin
with the one
obvious drug dealer
just 'cause I'm a wee bit
racist against my own people.
-I'm not racist.
-Hey, "not racist."
But you don't like boba
and you've never fucked
an Asian guy, so...
-Damn. Still?
-No, no. Remember that
foreign exchange student
from Kazakhstan?
B... Bizi... Bizip? Uh, Bazid?
-David?
-David. David.
Is Kazakhstan even in Asia?
They look kind of
Asian sometimes.
-KAT: Oh, my God!
-Okay. Racist.
When I masturbate, I sometimes
fantasize about Splinter.
-He's Asian.
-He's a rat.
He's a good father.
Fine. Fine. I'm sorry, okay?
It's my fault.
(SIGHS) Oh, my God.
We're in the middle
of nowhere.
My phone is dead.
We don't have
any food or water.
God. I should have
never come to China.
Wait, there's someone
on the road.
No, there isn't.
You're probably hallucinating.
Okay, maybe because
I also see a giraffe
peeling off his spots
and throwing them
like a frisbee.
(SCREAMS) Oh, shit!
-(ALL SHRIEK)
-LOLO: Jeez.
Okay, but that's a bus, right?
(BUS HONKING)
(BUS BRAKES HISSES)

I knew you would come for me.
Ni hao, Lolo.
I heard y'all needed a ride.
Okay, so the team is going
to give us a ride to Haiching
first thing in the morning.
-And then we can...
-LOLO: Ooh, ooh.
AUDREY: Oh.
Audrey, are you eye-fucking

No. No, no. Don't. No. Lolo,
don't get us in trouble.
We're just, you know, just,

-Let's be cool.
-I'm cool. I'm very cool.
I'm gonna Jaws the fuck

Aah. Aah.
-Your mouth is so big.
-Oh, my God.
I know. (CHUCKLES) But, look,
without teeth, not as big.
-Why is mine so tiny?
-I'm all underbite.
KAT: Okay. Can everyone
just close our mouths?
Let's just be adults, right?
Okay, they're just
some normal, attractive men.
It's nothing to lose your
minds over. It's... (GASPS)
-You okay?

It was eight coke bags.
It was eight. I just

Uh, my name's not Kat.

That's... Hermione.
I'm Ron. This is Harry.
-Hagrid.

Okay. Yeah.

so much like you rode out
to the Grand Canyon

You used to bang this dude?
(MOUTHING) Yeah.
-No. I'm actually engaged now.

(CHUCKLING) Hoo-hoo-hoo.
So we know what's
happening tonight.
No, no. I'm not hooking up
with Todd, okay? Okay?
I am not horny at all.
The coke that literally just
exploded inside my butthole
has no effect
on me whatsoever.
Um, I am gonna go now.
Have fun DJing

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um...
No, but you should...
You should have some fun.
-Yeah.
-They seem really nice.
You should go...
Oh, my God. Wait, look.

You should go talk to him.

One more round of Yobo, please.
And I know China is supposed

I don't know.
Ever since I got here,
I just, I feel like I'm doing
everything wrong.
Firstly, there is no way
to do Chinese wrong.
-Right. (LAUGHS)
-But secondly,
what's the one thing
you've been saying the most?
-I don't know.
-"I."
You've been saying,
"I can't eat the food."
"I am doing everything wrong."
It's not about that.
The thing is, in China,
the collective is much bigger
than the individual,
all right?

It's nice that you have

I'm not really like my family.
Well, you and me, both.
Really?
I feel like you and your
parents are kinda the same.
I mean, you're basically white.
No offense.
I'm Chinese, I'm not white.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sorry.
I say so many stupid things.
That's why my family thinks
I'm socially awkward
and too weird.
You think I am too.

It's funny, all night
I kept thinking about
what it'd be like
if I'd grown up here.
-Mmm.
-I'd be like everyone else,
you know?
People wouldn't stare at me
at the grocery store.
Or ask my parents
where they got me from.
I wouldn't always
just be the Asian girl.
You know, I could,
I could be the smart girl.
Or... or the nice, funny girl.
I wonder if I'd still feel
like I had to be perfect
all the time just to belong.
I don't know. Maybe my whole
life would be different.
I don't think it'd be
that much different.
Wow, bitch.
It's nice, right?
China looks good on you.
I kind of love it. (CHUCKLES)

we were the only
Asian people in town.
So we still
would've been friends.

don't know the difference.

We all end up in the same place.

I don't actually give a shit

or a Chinese lawyer
or a fucking German lawyer,
because I'm a lawyer.
And I'm goin' to
finish this job.
This is all a lot, you know?
You don't have to
think about work right now.
This says
she's in Seoul, right?
-That's what you said earlier?
-KAT: Uh, yeah.
Okay. So, if we go to
Seoul right now,
I could still find her
and bring her back in time
-to go to Chao's dinner.
-But there are probably, like,
ten thousand Min Parks
in Korea.
Yes, but we have
all of her info right here.
We can hire
a private investigator
-to track her down.
-I'm so in.
Thank you. Thank you, Deadeye.
You're an amazing friend.
Lolo, are you in?
I mean, this is what
you wanted, right?
-I'm in. I'm in, yeah.
-Yes. Thank you.
Thank you. Let's go.

Where are our passports?
Oh, they are in my suitcase
that got stolen.
We don't need fuckin' passports.
Let's go.
Let's think.
No bad ideas. Let's go.
We could flash
our titties and just

-That's a bad idea.
We could take
a rocket to space
and then try to land in Korea.
No customs in the atmosphere.
I feel like that's worse.
Okay, uh, we become
mail-order brides,
uh, and then we...
We find a really big envelope
and then we could just...

Hi, Chao.
So good to hear from you.
My mother and I were actually
just talking about you.
-Do not bother coming.
-What?
I saw the video of you
and your friend's
-devil vagina.
-Let me explain.
It's actually, it...
It's so hilarious.
You're gonna love this story.
It's...
-Um...
-You lied to me.
You told me you're in Beijing
with your mother.
But that's clearly not true.
I cannot do business
with someone
who's not who they
say they are.
Please. Just...
Just hear me out.
No, I've already
made up my mind.
I will tell your boss
that we are not
-going to sign.
-But, when you talk to Frank
can you please
just not mention
-the whole video thing?
-I already saw it.
-Shit!
-FRANK: I didn't know
you were this shady, Audrey.
I mean, that is the last time
that I take a chance
on someone like you.
Again, I mean associate,
not an Asian.
-Anyway, you're fired.
-What?
Frank. No...
I... I can fix this.
I'm still an ally though.
I fired a white guy
earlier this week.
Did the exact same thing.
Okay, Frank. Frank?
Frank, don't hang up.
(CRYING) I'm gonna get fired
from my show.

And I'm never gonna go to LA.
It's okay.

I just got fired.

-Chao saw the video.
-Your video.
-Yeah, well, whatever.

You'll get a new job.
-It's not that easy.

You're still a fucking child.
Okay, my life is ruined.
Your life is ruined?
My life is ruined, okay?
You can always find another
fucking desk job, okay?
I can never find
another Clarence.
And whose fault is that?
Maybe you should've
been honest with him
from the beginning instead of
lying every single day
for the past three years.
Whoa, what the fuck?
That's her business.
And since when are you
the spokesperson for honesty?
Okay, so are... Are you two
best friends now?
What, like Lilo and Stitch?
(IMITATES STITCH)
You fuckin' suck
at impressions.
(IN KOREAN)
Go fuck yourself!
I'll knock
your teeth out, bitch!
(CURSING IN KOREAN)
I am an actress.
And even I am less
self-involved than you are.
Huh.
-Kat.
-You know what? Kat's right.
You've been a shitty friend.
This entire time,
I was helping you
so you could get
promoted and leave me?
-I was doing it for my career.
-Why?
I mean, you're always talkin'
about how you feel like
-you don't belong there.
-I don't belong anywhere.
I'm clearly not white,
but you're always
telling me that I am.
And I'm also not Asian enough.
At least not for you.
That's all in your head!
Your life is perfect!
How is my life perfect
when I spend all my time
babysitting a grown-ass
-29-year-old woman?
-I'm babysitting you!
I've been saving your ass
since we were kids
-on the playground.
-You've never, ever
applied yourself, Lolo.
You wanna be a real artist?
Then grow up!
Right now, you're just
a barnacle with a cute hobby!
Yo, I may be a barnacle,
but at least I know who I am.
You know what?
If we didn't grow up
as the only two
Asian girls in town,
we never would've
been friends.
(AUDREY GASPS)
-Sorry.
-WOMAN: Thank you so much
for waiting.
-(SIGHS)
-We found the record
-of your birth mother.
-Oh, my gosh.
I... I can't read this. Um...
So do I call her or...
I... I'm sorry, I'd...
I don't know how this works.
I'm so sorry
to tell you that...
she's passed away.
(QUIET BY KINA GRANNIS
PLAYING)
I have the address
of where she was buried
if you would like
to visit her.
No. I'm, uh, um...
Do you have friend here?
-Someone you can call?
-No. Uh, it's okay. Thank you.
Thank... Thank, thank you,
thank you so much. Thank you.

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.
I don't... I don't speak Korean.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(IN ENGLISH) That's okay.
My name's Dae Han.
I'm Min Young's husband.
You must be the daughter.
Wait. Are...
Are you my...
No.
But I'm glad
to finally meet you.
We were only married
a few years before
she fell sick.
I'm so sorry.
They were good years.
We never had
kids of our own though.
I'm very sorry
I wasn't able to introduce you
to a little brother
or sister today.
(CHUCKLES) It's okay.
DAE: She always talked
about you though.
You know,
she was just a teenager
when she got pregnant.
Her boyfriend didn't
want to get in trouble,
and he denied it.
So, her parents sent her to
China until you were born.
They're the ones who forced
her to give you up.
But she never stopped
thinking about you.
If I tried to find her sooner
maybe she and I could...
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
But it's too late.
There's something
you should see.
When she got sick,
she wanted to throw a party.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
So, we rented a boat
and we sailed out
to Yeouido Park.
Uh, that's right along
the Han River.
Several of us got seasick
-on the way...
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)
...which she thought
was pretty hilarious.
-(DAE LAUGHS)
-(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
But it was beautiful.
She got to say goodbye
to everybody she loved.
Except for you.
So she made you this.

talking about?
Your English is very good.
(MIN SPEAKING KOREAN)
(IN ENGLISH) I am sorry
I could not be
part of your life.
I want to very much.
But when you were baby,
you smile so big.
And you cry so big. (CHUCKLES)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
I wonder what
you are like now.
Are you doctor?
-Lawyer? Teacher?
-(SHUDDERING BREATHS)
But it doesn't matter.
I'm proud to be your mother.
DAE: (LAUGHS)
It doesn't matter?
-That's not what you told me.
-(MIN SIGHS)
-(SPEAKING KOREAN)

(SPEAKING KOREAN)
(IN ENGLISH) My daughter...
I love you.
(CHUCKLES)
(CRYING)
(CONTINUES CRYING)
I'm sorry.
Well, glad we got a chance
to spend some time together.
Me, too.
Really have to go so soon?
Yeah, but I'll be back.
Um...
Thank you so much again
for everything.
And honestly,
I'm just so lucky that you
happen to be
at her grave that day.
Well, I appreciate that,
but, uh, it wasn't quite luck.
Your friends messaged me.
Uh...
Lolo, Kat, and... I know
I'm gonna get this one wrong.
Uh, Deadeye?
Yeah. Oh, um...
Yeah, my... My parents
must've told them.
Yeah, they told me that
you were actually in Korea
and that I might find you
if I went to the graveyard.
They didn't tell you
any of this, did they?
Oh, no. We, um...
It's just, we got into
a little bit of a fight.
And, uh, I...
I lost my job
and I said some...
really terrible things
to all of them and, uh...
It may not be
any of my business,
but it seems to me that
what matters the most
is if your friends love
you enough to forgive you.
-Well...
-And if they went through
all this trouble,
I think they would.
Where are they now?
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-(DOOR OPENS)
Hey, Kat.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Listen, I... I'm sorry about
everything that happened. I...
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no. I...
I listened to your voicemail.
The whole three hours of it.
I appreciate the honesty.
Truth of it is,
I kind of figured
that you'd had sex before.
You know, you're just
so sensual, and worldly
and one time I saw your
browser history and...
It's not like I didn't
wanna have sex.
I was just so worried
that I wouldn't live up
to your expectations.
And then
when I saw your tattoo,
I just got
crazy intimidated and...
Look, Kat, when we kiss,
I have to leave
space for Jesus.
I gotta leave that God gap
because I'm gonna
ruin my pants.
Every time.
That's why I wear
three pairs of underwear.
Oh, honey. I love you so much
that I gave up the thing
I love second most for you.
-(SIGHS)
-And I love dick.
I can be dick.
And I can love you.
I can do both.
So, should we have sex
right now?
-Ah. Ooh. Ooh. Oh.
-Ah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
what's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
Ha... Save... No... (GRUNTS)
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Saved it.
-Saved it.
-Mmm.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Thanks, Jin Ho.
Heard you got into med school.
So proud.
Here you go. Hot and steamy.
Let me know
if you want hot sauce.
I'll get you the Chinese kind.
Pretty sure you can handle it.
-Hi.
-You had me at "Hi."
AUDREY: (CHUCKLING) Oh.
Hi.
I didn't know
you worked here now.
I don't. I'm just covering
'cause Jing's out sick.
I'm trying to match her vibe.
What do you think?
(SHOUTING) Number 32!
Number 32!
Party of two!
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, that's good.
-Lolo.
-Sorry. I'm so sorry. Um...
She doesn't wanna talk to you.
Yeah, I figured
when I left her, like,
ten messages and she didn't
call me back.
Sorry.
Family first. Have to do it.
Respectfully, of course.
Yeah, no, I know. I know.
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.
(OVER MICROPHONE) Lolo! Lolo!
No, no, no. Lolo! Stop.
No, no, no. Hey! Hey!
Break! Break! Stop!
-Sorry. I'm so sorry.
-(FEEDBACK WHINES)
Sorry, everyone.
Enjoy your meal.
Um, it's, it's just that
everything's a mess
and it's all my fault.
Ever since we were kids,
I was this scared little girl
who always felt like she had
to prove herself to everyone
except for you.
You were always
looking out for me.
With you was the only time
I felt safe to be me.
Even though I didn't know
who the hell I was. (CHUCKLES)
But you've always been
comfortable being you.
And you tried to make me feel
that way too.
You know me better
than I know myself.
I...
You were right. I hated
working at that law firm.
But... Thanks to you, I can do
something more meaningful.
Start my own practice.
Because I know that
I'm brave enough now.
Hell yeah.
She had a devil's threesome
in China.
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-MAN: Huh? What?
-(WOMAN LAUGHING)
-(SOFTLY) I did.
(IMPERCEPTIBLE)
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Lolo, it's so great
that you are working here.
And I'm so proud
of you for that
but you are an incredible,
true artist.
You cannot give that up
just because
I am a lying, hurtful,
stupid failure of a friend.
Audrey, I haven't given up.
Look.
My wall of licky cats.
I just sold one yesterday.
I'm only waiting tables
for now so I'm not
such a barnacle.
You've always been
a better friend to me
than I have been to you.
And I'm so, so sorry.
Just shut up. Okay?
You're the best friend
I could ever ask for.
The biggest support system.
And I'm sorry. I'm the one
that's fuckin' sorry.
I took you for granted.
So, does that mean
you forgive me?
(CHUCKLES) Come here, bitch.
-(AUDREY LAUGHING)
-(ALL APPLAUDING)
Friendship.
Party of three?
Oh, my God. Get in here.
-LOLO: Deadeye.
-(AUDREY CHUCKLING)
We're back, baby!
Wait, are we all back?
Have you and Kat
started talkin' again?
Yeah, I called her to apologize.
But wait, does that mean
you and Kat were talking?
We've been in touch.
-We're like this.
-AUDREY: Mmm.
So, we should all go on
a trip again, the four of us.
To beautiful South Dakota.
Home of the Corn Palace.
-AUDREY: Yeah.
-Bookmark it.
Kat and I actually
had a place in mind.
Bonjour!
Look at us! Look at us!
Our second
annual best friends trip.
This is gonna be iconic.
Let's start with some
art and culture.
KAT: Oh, I love Roldan.
LOLO: I gotta say, the French
know how to sculpt a titty.
DEADEYE: I love art.
AUDREY: Oh, that's gonna be
so much fun.
DEADEYE: Art. Art. Art.
So, is anyone hungry?
-Yes. Please.
-I am.
AUDREY: I want to try escargot.
LOLO: You know, we don't
have to eat French food.
-This is so good.
-KAT: I love this bulgogi.
AUDREY: Mmm.
LOLO: Mmm.
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-LOLO: Okay, okay. A toast.
To Audrey. Badass boss bitch
-starting her own firm.
-Yes, she is!
To our dearest Deadeye.
Because they host the most
incredible game night
specifically so I can
crush them at Catan.
-(KAT CHUCKLES)
-And to Kat
who's in a movie
directed by the Greta Gerwig.
-Yes, she is!
-(ALL LAUGHING)
Okay. And to our very own
Frida Kah-Lolo...
-Aw.
-(KAT CHUCKLES)
...whose lotus collection
is finally at the MOCA.
Well, it's not the Museum of
Contemporary Arts
but it is a cafe in Snohomish.
So ganbei to that.
ALL: Ganbei!
-AUDREY AND KAT: Mmm.
-I don't wanna hijack
our second annual
best friends trip
but Clar-Bear and I looking at
fall dates for the wedding
and I was just wondering...
will you all be
my bridal party?
-LOLO: Really? Of course.
-Of course, we will.
AUDREY: Duh!
LOLO: Ooh!
The bridal party should all get
matching tattoos like Kat.
Okay, very funny.
-Very funny. Ha-ha.
-(ALL LAUGHING)
ALL: Ganbei!
AUDREY: Mmm.
Mmm. Or we could get a tattoo
of the Chinese flag
to commemorate the motherland.
Or Princess Peach.
I haven't decided.
I think I'm gonna get
an Eiffel Tower.
LOLO: Because Paris?
AUDREY: No, the...
LOLO: Hmm. Yeah.
KAT: Yeah, like you all are
gonna get tattoos.
DEADEYE:
What if I already got one?
(ALL LAUGHING)
I already got one.
-KAT: You did not.
-LOLO AND AUDREY: What?
Wanna see?
(UNZIPS PANTS)
(ALL SCREAMING)
It lights up.
ALL: Ooh!
