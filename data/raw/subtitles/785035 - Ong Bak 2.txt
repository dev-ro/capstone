In the Buddhist year of 1974 (1421 AD)
During the reign of King Rama II of Ayuthaya
The Ayuthaya royal court became more powerful than Sukhothai
and expanded to the east
The Ayuthaya army seiged the City of Angels for 7 months
1 year and 3 month later...
Go catch the boy!
Hey! Stop!
Hey! Get down!
Get down!
Let go!
Let me go!
This boy is next
He is the next fighter
I will give you a chance little boy
To save your life
Let's start
Your life depends on you, young boy
Teean. Wake up
Because of you
I want to be as skilful as my father
When will you be back?
Is this the boy?
Yes, father Cheang Kla
There is a light in his eyes
when he fights
that reminds me of someone
Spirits will fear him
He has a powerful destiny
His hands!
When he uses a weapon
he will be the best of the best
I'm Cher Nung
I am the leader of Pha Beek Krut pirates
I am impressed with you
That you fight with the crocodile unyieldingly and bravely
If you want to learn about martial arts at my home
I will allow you to
Or if you want to go elsewhere, I will not stop you
Shoot!
Connect your mind and your body
Fuse with the weapon and use its power
That is the thing you need to practice
Every weapon has a different power
long and short
weak and strong
light and heavy
The weapon is power
Someone who can merge their mind and their body with it
will be a great and powerful person
The world and everyone will yield to their power
I’m Cher Nung, the leader of Pha Peek Krut pirates
who has given you a new life
From now on
you will always remember
that you are a Pha Peek Krut pirate
For the test of dexterity and cleverness
Teean passes
The next test is about fighting
It is very good
My son!
This place
is the place to prove the power of your mind
Torture...
Let me go!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Don’t be afraid of me
You don’t need to be scared
I will set you free
Come with me
I will help you
Don’t be scared
Don’t be scared
Your life depends on you
Killing and compassion
are the last things that a leader has to learn
My brothers, my sons and my grandsons!
Today,
the spirit god of Fah Mansong
has sent a black ivory tusk
from this king of elephants to us
as a sign of good fortune
This special mystical object
will bring prosperity
to our community
Now.
I, Cher Nung
announce that
now and after,
in future times
I give Teean
the position of second in command, after me
Why doesn't dad teach me to fight?
I don’t want to learn dancing
I don’t want to go
I want to be with dad
You need to go, don’t you know?
You will be a great person
Believe your mother
I respectfully ask you to teach my son
All of you have had a long journey
Let's go in the house
It is more than 3 months
since Ayuthaya started to expand their power
but the situation in Ayuthaya town
is still not under control
The heir to the throne
is anxious
and orders have been given to me
to suppress rebellion in the conquered towns
Why does Ayuthaya rush to expand its power?
Does the city administrator, Ratchasena,
seek to oppose the King's heir?
All of this is Ratchasena's idea
Power is dangerous
but a person who abuses power is more dangerous
This country will be aflame
People will rebel everywhere
The situation cannot be trusted
Only you and the master are trustworthy
It is in these circumstances that I will trust
to leave Teean here
Brother Bua
I'm so scared, I have lost all spirit
I leave him under your protection
I will try my best as much as I can
both of you need to be careful
Heung Sri. Klong Kri
Take us out now
Yes sir
My name is Pim
My parents are both dead
Master Bua has looked after me since I was very young
And you?
My father’s name is Singhadachoo
He is one of the four top military leaders of Ayuthaya
I told my dad I wanted to learn about weapons and fighting
I want to be skilful, like my father
But he sent me to learn about dance
How I can fight?
Maen!
Itch, itch. Itchy balls!
Spin too
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin
Gone!
Gone too!
Already gone
Teean
Do you think a person who learns about weapons
will lead this country to happiness?
I only think that
learning about weapons to protect myself
to help good people kill bad people
can help this country be happy
Good
What you say is good
Teean
There are a lot of weapons in this world
Which one will you use to help your people and country?
You don't need to answer me now
Take this
Let start business
Let me go!
Mother! Mother!
Son! Son!
Who?
You there!
You there!
Do you really dare?
Eat! Eat! Eat!
