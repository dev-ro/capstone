My name is Wesley Deeds the Third.
I grew up fifth generation
Ivy League graduate.
I can tell you my pedigree
all the way back to the tribe
that my greatest grandfather came from.
I was born into privilege,
groomed by my father to be a businessman,
to take over his company.
Groomed by my mother to be a gentleman.
I was told where to stand and how to dress,
how to cut my hair,
and what I would be doing
for the rest of my life
from the time that I was five years old.
And right now, I seem to be on track.
Whose track, I don't really know.
By this time,
my mother thought I should be married,
and according to my life schedule,
it's four months away.
I'll be marrying her, Natalie.
She's amazing.
We're perfect together.
(SIGHS) With a life like mine,
you'd think that I wake up happy every day,
but I don't.
My life is perfect.
But I often wonder, am
I living my own life,
or the life that I've been told to live?
This tie is too dark.
WESLEY: I think this tie is too dark.
Green.
WESLEY: Green. Green's better.
Maria forgot to put the shoe stretchers
in my shoes.
(WESLEY SIGHS)
Babe, you know Maria forgot to
put my shoe stretchers in again?
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'll talk to her.
MAN ON RADIO:
- I'll tell you who it won't be, Deeds Incorporated.
According to the rumor mill,
the software giant...
No, I've been listening to the radio.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Listen, this is what I want you to do.
Just get everybody, set
up a conference call,
I will figure it out when I get there.
John, don't panic. It's all fine.
I'm looking at the paper now.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Okay. Thanks.
Hello.
Yeah, I have a morning meeting.
Showing the Jones apartment. Right.
Hey, can you tell Jeffrey
to have something cool for kids?
- What do kids like?
- Toys, honey.
Toys. Toys.
Bye. See you soon.
What would you like for breakfast?
(QUIETLY) Egg whites and oatmeal.
Egg whites and oatmeal will be fine.
And don't forget the grapefruit juice.
- And grapefruit juice?
- Right here.
(SIGHS)
- I don't care, Walter!
- Fine.
It doesn't matter to me! Neither do you!
Get out of here, then!
You know what? Karma's a bitch!
And you're gonna get yours.
Walter!
You're crazy! You're a drunkard!
And you're a nobody!
- Trick.
- Oh, yeah, I'm a trick?
Don't look at me like that, just drive!
- Walter...
- Just drive!
Walter, how long before
you get your driver's license back?
You tired of driving me already?
You know what, I'll get a driver.
Don't you worry about me. I don't need you.
I didn't say I was tired of driving you.
I just asked you a question, that's ail.
I don't know.
Mom won't speak to the judge.
- Would you do it?
- No!
Come on. Please!
Why can't you just get your license back
just like everybody else
who's had several DUIs?
You know, Dad would've done it for me.
'Cause he loved me.
We all love you, okay?
WALTER: Well, Mom has
a weird way of showing it.
WESLEY: She's been through a lot
with you, man, she's tired.
Get a tie out of the glove box.
We're seeing her for lunch.
WALTER: Hell, no. Hell, no! I ain't going
Take me home, Wesley!
WESLEY: We're going to work,
then we're going to lunch.
WALTER: Okay, just shut up!
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
I'll have it later, when I get off.
Lindsey, you know, the owner could
have the sheriff here today.
Come on, Milton. Just
take one for the team.
She's already filed the writ of eviction.
(SIGHS)
- Will you just give me a couple hours?
MILTON: (SIGHS) - Give me a break.
Look, I'm saying I'll have it.
I just need...
I'll have it today. All right?
Just tell her that.
That's all I'm asking, just tell her that.
(SIGHS)
Are we gonna get put out?
I don't want you worrying about that.
How much more do we need?
Ariel, stop it.
Come on, let's get your shoes on.
We're gonna make a stop
before you get to school.
WOMAN ON RADIO:
We can expect light onshore wind
coupled with an upper level
low pressure drop off the coast
that will deepen the marine layer
across the coastline today...
LINDSEY: We got a spot!
You know what? Watch what you're doing!
You trying to kill me? Damn!
Lady! Listen. Hey, hey.
Look, you're in my parking spot.
Oh, really. Well, you know what?
I'll just be one second.
- Lady, I got a conference call I gotta get to...
- I haven't got time for this right now!
Excuse me? "I have a conference call"?
That ain't how you stop
no black woman in her tracks.
- Walter, don't you...
- This how you stop a woman. Hey, bitch!
WESLEY: Walter!
Who the hell are you calling "bitch"?
The man said move your car!
- Hey! Hey!
- Walter!
That mouth of yours
is gonna get you killed, man.
Hey, Kat. Yeah, man, this is Walt Deeds.
Listen, I need a tow truck in the parking lot.
Some lady parked in my brother's spot.
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks.
This woman left her child in the car, man.
So? That car and that kid
are about to get towed, man.
Just leave your car here,
Kat'll come down and he'll park it.
Call April, have her transfer
the conference call down to the car, okay?
You want to sit here and wait?
Yeah, April?
I don't talk to strangers.
Wes wants the conference call
transferred to the car.
Thank you.
WALTER: See? Little black girl
already got attitude.
And that little black girl gonna turn into
an even bigger damn black girl
with even bigger attitude, man!
Just get in the car, Walter.
Just get in the car, please.
You know I don't have a cell phone.
It's hard as hell trying to find a payphone
and you're not answering the phone.
Inventory.
Can I get my check?
And then I have to go someplace,
just for a couple of hours.
Your shift starts in 30 minutes.
I know, and I will make it up.
I just... There's something I gotta do.
Be back by 10:00.
- What is this?
- Your check.
No, I know that.
But I worked 80 hours this past two weeks.
So where's the rest of it?
Human Resources got a letter from the IRS.
They said you were behind in back taxes,
so they held most of your pay.
No. I need all of it.
Today. I have to have it today.
There's nothing I can do, doll.
Why don't you call the IRS
and see if you can't
make some type of arrangement with them?
Can you give me an advance on next week?
They're going to take most of your check
for the next six months.
I've been trying to talk to you
about that position from 4:00 to 11:00.
And who looks after my kid at night?
I'm sorry, doll.
- No, you're not.
- We gotta fill it quickly.
If you want it,
you'd better tell me about it now.
Do I have a choice?
I gotta take my kid to school.
With Dexter leaving,
where does that put us, John?
Not in the best place.
They were 75% of our profit.
Hold on a second, when did they get
to 75%? Last quarter it was 60.
When Walt offered them a 12% discount
on all new products, they upped their deal.
It was a good idea at the time.
Okay, it was!
WESLEY: Fine, we're in it now.
Get every financial bit of information
you can on Brunson.
I'll be burning the midnight oil on this
one, John, so I'll be up in a second.
LINDSEY: Wait a second.
Uh, excuse me. How much does this cost?
Mr. Deeds says it's free for employees.
- Everybody?
- Yes.
(SINGING)
WALTER: Wow. Fat Boy Harley. Nice.
(TRUCK ALARM BEEPING)
You just ought to do that, Wes.
Do what?
Get a bike.
Meet up with Rich, Josh, in Mexico.
Were you not just on this conference call?
I got a business to run.
I can run this company.
Oh, you don't think I can run the business?
- Walter.
- What?
Wesley, this wasn't even your dream.
It was mine.
- I can run this company, man.
- How about you show me?
Stop saying it, just show me.
LINDSEY: Oh, no. Hey. Hey!
- No, come on, please.
WALTER: - Here she comes.
I'm sorry, lady. You were parked illegally.
You made him tow my car?
You parked in his spot, lady.
I'm not talking to you, midget!
I'm talking to this ass.
- Ass?
- Yeah, you heard me.
WALTER: He's the ass?
LINDSEY: I was in there for a second.
Look, I don't know how much they pay you
for doing your job, but I can...
Look, I got $10...
- Go on, just take it.
- I'm sorry, lady. I told you I'm sorry.
Get your kid out, please.
- No, sweetie.
- Please don't let them take my mommy's car.
- Sweetie, come on.
WALTER: - It's your mother's fault.
Learn early.
You piss a man off, he will get even!
Don't you talk to my kid!
Don't you say a word to my kid!
- Sir. Sir.
- Walter.
He's a "sir" now, huh?
Gone from an ass to sir?
- Sir Ass ain't got nothin' to say to your ass.
- Walter, Walter.
LINDSEY: Please don't take my car.
"Please don't take." You
ain't got no choice!
Hey, Frank, get it out of here!
All right, you don't park in a man's spot!
See, that's what's wrong with women, man.
You want to start a fight with a man
and boo-hoo when he fight back!
Walter. Go. Just get the elevator.
Please.
Next time you might want to
find somewhere else to park.
Put it down, Frank.
Jillian, just park my car, okay?
I think my iPad's in the back.
You just sit down.
Ass!
- You see? Move, man!
- Walter, it's handled!
No! You ain't gonna handle it.
I'm gonna handle it!
- I ain't gonna let her call you an ass!
- Get on the elevator, man.
- Come on, man!
- Please.
You like getting walked on?
(YELLS IN FRUSTRATION)
(SIGHS) God.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
Ms. Wakefield! Ms. Wakefield.
I need to talk to you for a second.
- I'm running really late for work.
- This will only take a second.
If you get cold, put that on. I love you.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, baby.
- Hi.
- Ooh, I'm having a day! (LAUGHS)
- I just need to tell you...
- Mmm-hmm.
...you bring your daughter to school late
and you pick her up late
and her teacher has been complaining.
Well, I will bring her on time.
Okay, but I have to tell you.
This is a warning.
I'm not one of your students, Ms. Mackey.
I hear you.
Oh, isn't this exciting, Mrs. Deeds?
Very. Oh, I wish I had a daughter.
- Girls are a handful.
- Yeah. Boys, too.
Especially that son of mine.
- How is Walt?
- He's better.
I cannot believe the two of you
are finally getting married.
Do you have any idea
how much your mother and I
have wanted this for the two of you?
Yeah. I think I do.
Well, it's a good thing
they wanted it, too.
And pretty soon your little ones
will be playing with my little ones.
I'm beside myself
at the thought of having grandchildren!
Let's get through the engagement party
first, huh, kids?
- You do want children, don't you?
- Of course she does.
Well, you better get busy.
You're not getting any younger.
WOMAN: Looks like
mostly little girl's stuff in this one.
(TIRES SCREECH)
MAN: Isn't this nice? At least get $50.
- No! No!
MAN 2: - This, you might get $30.
This is my place!
No, I beg you, please. No! Give me...
Put that down!
- How could you do this?
- I'm sorry!
You let them do this!
I told you she would do this!
(CARS HONKING)
- No!
- I tried to talk her out of it!
- Yeah, sure you did.
- I did.
- Yeah, sure you did.
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me!
Yeah, what are you looking at?
(CARS HONKING)
Don't you help me!
MAN: - Move your car!
- Go to hell!
MAN: Lady, what do you think this is?
- Shame on you.
MAN: - Let's go!
All right, shame on you!
(SOBBING)
HOSTESS: - Good afternoon, Mrs. Deeds.
- Hello.
Oh!
(CHUCKLES)
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Mom, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Hmm.
Sit up straight. Rise and greet me.
Well, sit up or stand up,
what do you want, Mom?
- "Hello" will do fine.
- Hello, Mother.
Thank you.
- You look quite lovely.
- Thank you!
You should see the wedding dress.
It's not quite my taste,
but it'll work just fine.
I'm so proud of you.
You remind me of your father.
I told you, you shouldn't get married.
Natalie is a respectable girl
from a very fine family,
unlike that trailer-park cheerleader
you married.
Mother, if I remember correctly,
Dad met you at a trailer park.
Mother? The engagement party,
how's the planning going?
Mom?
It's going to be beautiful.
What is this, Walt?
A drink in the middle of the day?
Well, if I have to sit here with you,
you better be glad
it's not a mountain of cocaine.
You enjoy this, don't you?
Oh. Yes, lam.
You think it's funny.
Why can't you be more like your brother?
Mom, now look, what's going on?
I wanted to see you.
You insisted on inviting your brother.
Well, you said it was about business
and, uh, (CLEARS THROAT)
he is a part of the business,
so I thought he should be here.
Still going to your meetings?
Why?
Yes. Yes, he is. I make sure of it.
Mom. What's going on?
I read the newspaper. Are we all right?
This is just like I thought.
You're worried about yourself.
Your father worked very hard
to build this business,
and to lose it like this
would be unthinkable.
Don't worry, Mom, perfect little Wesley's
gonna work it all out for you.
Oh, yes, he will.
And you will find some way
to try to sabotage it.
Where are you going?
I'm going to have a cigarette.
Is that okay?
I can't drive.
Wesley has to drive me, Mom,
'cause you have my car locked up
in the office garage.
Okay? I'm going to have a smoke.
It takes the patience of
Job to deal with him.
Don't get worked up about it, Mother.
He's fine. It's all fine.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Okay, go on.
Now listen.
I need you to help Mommy and be a big girl.
- You can lay down...
- I'm scared.
No, listen, you can try and go to sleep, and
I'll be back to check on you in an hour.
I want Daddy.
Ariel, don't do that.
Don't do that "Daddy" thing.
Come on.
But you must not come out of the closet,
all right?
And I'll be back to check
on you in an hour.
Put the participation
and the operating profit,
and you take that from the gross...
I don't understand what he's doing,
or how he's doing this.
- Can we go home now?
- What?
Can we go home now?
I'm still working, Walter.
And you should be, too.
Did you finish the Brunson report?
Anything else, Mr. CEO?
(SIGHS)
I'm taking a cab home.
WESLEY: - Don't say a word.
- Ah!
You know, everybody around here
is talking about him, it's not just me.
He's not doing a very good job.
He's sleeping with several staffers.
John. My brother.
My father told me to take care of him
and that's what I intend to do.
Can you take care of this, please?
Make sure it's right.
Okay. Look, I gotta go.
Heidi's going out with Natalie tonight
and I get to play Daddy.
Oh. Okay.
Come on. Let's do this tomorrow morning.
No, no, I'm not leaving here
until I figure this out.
This one, I'm gonna burn the midnight oil.
Something's up.
All right. I'll talk to you later.
All right, yeah.
- Tell Heidi I said hi.
- Yeah.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
HEIDI: Okay, John, okay. I love you.
Kiss the kids for me, okay?
All right. Bye, I love you.
How amazing is it
that he's given me tonight off?
I mean, I can't believe it, we're out!
Yeah, I'm so glad you could come out, girl.
Me, too! I know, the kids keep me so busy.
Okay, Heidi, can we please not talk
about your kids today?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm a jerk.
It's just that all we ever talk about
these days are your kids.
I know, I'm sorry. It's girls' night out.
So we're here for Mark.
No kids, no husbands.
No future husbands.
In fact, I am turning this phone off.
Thank you.
- So how late we gonna be out tonight?
- As late as we wanna be.
Okay. Better call the
nanny and tell her... No.
You better call Wesley
and tell him it's gonna be a long night.
No, no, no.
We do not have that kind of relationship.
- What do you mean?
- We just don't check in with each other.
- You don't?
- No.
- What?
(LAUGHS) I just don't understand that.
No, I don't have to check in with him,
because I know where he is.
I can literally set my watch by Wesley.
Like, he always does the same thing,
and he's always gonna do the same thing,
so...
Like right now, I know that he's
working late in his office.
- Huh. Wow.
(MUSIC BLARING)
- What? What?
- It's just crazy.
(SIGHS)
JOHN OVER PHONE: - Hello?
- John.
Hey, listen, I am sitting at the office,
and I've gone through
all of these financial reports,
- and I see what Brunson is doing.
- What?
He's in dire straits.
He has got this other company
that is interested in bidding,
so he's trying to drive
up all of his prices.
That's why
he took the biggest client from us.
It is, uh, pretty evident
he can't afford to support him.
You sound pretty sure about this.
I know it, man.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at it.
It's pretty clever, but I knew I'd find it.
You know what, can you try and get
a meeting with him for me tomorrow?
Yeah, okay.
I'll call him first thing in the morning.
This is a message for Ms. James.
Uh, it's Lindsey Wakefield.
I need to talk to you about making
some kind of payment arrangements,
and I will call you at 10:00 a.m.
sharp tomorrow.
I'll be working,
so, uh, that's the only time I can call...
(CLEARING THROAT)
- Bye.
Uh... I'm sorry.
I didn't know that anybody was here.
You do know
that's grounds for termination, right?
Oh, you gonna run off,
tell massa everything what's goin' on?
Just give me a break, black man.
"Run tell massa"?
I know about the old white dude
that owns this place.
He's evil to all you employees.
Look, I get it.
I won't do it again.
Old white dude. What's his name?
I don't know. You don't know his...
Deeds? Deeds Incorporated?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna use the phone again.
"Ass."
You think you gonna get some ass
to keep your mouth shut?
What is wrong with you?
Lady, I wasn't asking for ass.
You called me an ass,
when you parked in my spot.
(SIGHS) Yes, that was me. I'm so sorry.
I really need this job.
I'm in all kinds of... Please.
When I saw your child sitting in that car,
she was afraid.
Reminded me of the time that my parents
took me to the Maldives one summer.
My father said, "Don't go into the sea, son.
I can't swim, so don't go in."
I didn't care. I grabbed the life ring,
soon as he turned his back I jumped in.
I almost drowned.
My father's standing there,
screaming, "Swim, son, swim!"
Children don't really know
what adults know.
You shouldn't leave her alone in a car.
And don't use the phone again.
How many kids you got?
How many kids have you got?
I don't have any children.
Yeah. That's what I thought.
So don't you lecture me
on how to raise my child,
Mr. Maldives.
How'd you get out?
Excuse me?
The water. Your daddy couldn't swim,
so how'd you get out?
My brother. He jumped in and saved me.
See, you should've kept your ass
on the shore.
What?
Are you following me?
Where'd you come from, beautiful?
LINDSEY: The babysitter
just dropped her off.
Ariel, can you get down from there?
You know, you really shouldn't be
sitting here on these side streets.
My secretary got mugged
going to her car one night. Pretty...
Thank you!
What? What do you want?
Are you okay?
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Are you okay?
You're just sitting here.
My car won't start, but it's fine.
I don't know much about cars, but I could
call a tow truck for you, maybe.
Yeah, you did that already.
I don't mind dropping you and your
daughter off somewhere if you like.
No, I have a friend
who's gonna be here soon.
- Somebody's on their way?
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll just wait, then.
- No! What?
I'll just find a spot here.
LINDSEY: He is not gonna park his car.
He is gonna... (SIGHS)
Ariel, just keep quiet, all right?
I don't know what this man wants.
LINDSEY: But...
I did not invite you in my car.
Hi.
What's your name?
- Ariel.
- I'm Wesley.
(CHUCKLES) You know
Ariel's the name of a mermaid?
Did anybody tell you that?
How do you know that?
I know something about it.
I got a friend who has two kids
and they love The Little Mermaid.
- Did you hear my name?
- Well, obviously.
Uh. Well, you just told her.
It's Wesley. I got it.
Wesley Deeds.
What?
(WHISPERING) I'm the Old White man.
Oh!
And you are?
- Unemployed, Fight?
- No.
LINDSEY: Oh, I'm so humiliated.
I'm so sorry.
And I called you an ass.
I'm Lindsey.
Good to meet you, Lindsey.
And you don't have to stay here.
It's all good.
No, it's fine, really. Uh...
My secretary was mugged.
I felt really bad when she was,
'cause I had her working really late...
- So you want to stay in the car.
- I'll stay here, it's all fine.
You work with my mom?
Uh, yes, I do.
- What floor?
- On the top floor.
- I was on the top.
- No, Ariel, don't...
Don't be bothering Mr. Deeds
with all that chat.
Sorry.
(SIGHS)
Got a lot of stuff in here.
We, uh...
We're in the process of moving.
Right, baby? We're done. Almost done.
What part of town?
I don't think you'd know it.
(STOMACH RUMBLING)
Is that your stomach?
Are you hungry?
What? Again? Sweetie, you
didn't eat with the babysitter?
You know, there's a pizza joint
right up the block here.
You want to take a walk?
Would you like some pizza?
No. I don't think I have my wallet.
WESLEY: No, I got it, it's fine.
Now come on.
Come on, honey.
Come on, let's go.
It's right around the corner.
- Come on, Ariel!
- Okay, that's what we're doing. Yep.
That's just perfect.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
HEIDI: Mark, I think she needs our help.
I need a drink. Is this me?
So, uh, what's going on with you?
What? Why aren't you guys dancing?
- Why have you not stopped dancing?
- Because I'm having a good time.
The last time you did this
was back in college,
- when you broke up with...
- Rene, right!
What are you guys talking about?
MARK: Why haven't I met
your future husband yet?
'Cause you're busy.
He's busy, everybody's busy.
MARK: No one is that busy, okay?
I met Rene the first week you met him.
You were in love,
you were falling all over him.
You talked about him all the time.
This man, you do not talk about.
He's amazing, okay?
He's fantastic and I am in love.
- Hmm. Am I missing something?
- Yes, a good time.
You Debbie Downers are blowing my buzz.
(WHOOPING)
You're really enjoying that, aren't you?
Yeah.
(VIDEO GAME BLEEPING)
You know, you have eyed that video game
five times in the last four minutes.
Do you want to play?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
My mom doesn't have enough money
to play fun things.
(SCOFFS)
No, fun things should be free. Come on!
I got a little money, come on.
Do you know how to play this?
WESLEY: Let's see what we got here.
WESLEY: This one? Here we are.
(BEEPING)
- Hey, hey.
She's a pretty special kid.
LINDSEY: Hey, I don't know
why she's so hungry.
WESLEY: Kids are always hungry.
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING)
Harley.
- Softail Deluxe.
- Deluxe!
What do you know about it?
Her daddy used to work at a place
called Baker Boy's Bikes.
- On Elm?
- Yes!
- You know it?
- I do, I do.
Well, small world.
I remember when I was a kid, boy, I
would spend hours there all the time.
You ride?
I did once. When I was about 17.
Hmm.
We'd hang out there all day. We all wanted...
It's so crazy.
We all wanted to get Harleys, right?
We just had this dream of riding our bikes
all over the world,
digging wells in remote villages.
So I started trying to learn how to ride
and my mom found out I was hanging out
down there and she hit the roof.
Crazy, right?
I don't think that is crazy at all.
It means you have a good heart.
That's what that means.
(WESLEY CLEARS THROAT)
So you ride?
You're looking at a pro.
Oh, come on. (LAUGHS)
That I would like to see.
Well, not on this salary, you won't.
Mmm-mmm.
So am I fired?
No.
But I gotta tell you, nobody's ever
talked to me like that before.
You park in my spot, you call me an ass.
Shoot, I mean, it's just been
a pretty interesting day, my friend.
- That is sad, if that is true.
- What's sad?
LINDSEY: Wait a second.
Uh, excuse me. How much does this cost?
Mr. Deeds says it's free for employees.
- Everybody?
- Yes.
(SINGING)
It means nobody's ever
told you the truth...
- No, I beg to differ.
- ...that's what that means.
People tell me the truth,
they're just not...
They're just not rude when they say it.
I wouldn't call it rude.
I was just being direct.
- Direct?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh. Okay, fine. If you say so
- Mmm-hmm. I do.
Direct.
Does that turn you on?
Hmm?
(LAUGHING)
- Now you got jokes.
- Look at your face.
Funny, too.
How long have you worked at the company?
A year.
So what is it, this Deeds Incorporated?
What do you do?
My father was a computer whiz.
And he came up with this great software,
sold it to the government.
It was top secret.
About 20 years ago
he got it declassified and went public.
Company went through the roof.
A little help from affirmative action,
because it was very necessary.
From there,
he started buying smaller companies,
taking their ideas, branding them with his.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did I lose you? Did I lose you?
Just talk to me like a real person.
What is it that you sell? Come on.
(LAUGHS) Okay, how about this?
We sell computer software.
All right.
My dad's dream.
And he did it.
Speaking of dreams,
was it your dream to be a janitor?
You ask a lot of questions.
I'm sorry. That's what an ass will do.
You said it.
No. I was in nursing school.
I had two years left. I was close.
Two years left? What happened?
Two years ago, her dad died in Iraq.
He was in the military.
So it all fell on me. I quit school.
But I needed a job, so I'm a janitor.
- I'm sorry.
- You know what?
My boyfriend was on his way over
to help with the car
and if I'm not there, or if you...
Oh, yeah, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I understand.
- You understand?
- I completely understand.
Forgive me.
I should be getting home anyway.
- It's getting late.
- You want me to get some of that?
No. Please, it's all fine.
Let's get out of here.
WESLEY: So, you enjoy yourself?
ARIEL: Yeah.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
LINDSEY: Yeah.
Sure hope your boyfriend gets here soon.
What boyfriend?
Good night, Ariel.
I guess I'll see you around, then.
- Yeah. Thank you!
- All right. Hope you enjoyed yourself.
That man is persistent.
(ENGINE STARTING)
I nearly lost my job.
All right, come on, let's get some gas.
(SHUSHING)
(LAUGHING)
MARK: Someone is Sister Sloshed.
- Wow!
- Somebody woke up mistah.
(LAUGHING)
HEIDI: She's all yours.
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye. Bye, precious.
- Tell John I'll see him in the morning.
- I will.
- Bye. I had a good time.
- Bye.
- Mark, you better not be driving.
- I have a driver!
What is this?
Oh, yeah, you're wasted.
Come on, I'll take you to bed.
Mmm. I might take you to bed.
- You gonna take me? Okay. Take me.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm gonna take you to bed on the couch.
What are you doing?
- Mmm.
- Oh!
All right, babe. Let me close the blinds.
You know how sick
the guy across the way is...
I know.
- Hey.
- Please stop it.
- Look at my ass! (LAUGHS)
- Babe, babe.
- That's not funny.
- Let him watch.
- He can learn something.
- Really, stop.
Just get the remote off the table.
Oh, my God. Really?
You can't do one spontaneous thing
in your whole life? Just one thing?
Who cares? Let him watch!
Come on.
Go ahead.
Mommy, I'm hungry
You're gonna have some breakfast
at school. All right?
WESLEY: We appreciate your seeing us
this morning, Mr. and Mrs. Brunson.
What's this about?
We'd like to buy your company.
My father worked his entire life
building that company.
So did ours.
WESLEY: That, I'm aware of.
But I've been looking at your quarterly
reports for the last three years
and things aren't looking too good.
You can't survive with those numbers.
Yes, I can, and I have been for years.
And with the pick up of Dexter Sky,
well, things are looking up.
Dexter Sky, yes, our biggest client.
You just pulled them right out
from under us.
But in order to do that, you had to make
some pretty steep promises, yes?
Puts you in a great position to sell.
It does, John, but you know what?
If I were in the same position,
I probably would've done the same thing.
That's really great.
You think that all these things were done
to get you to buy my company?
Come on. Of course.
Your father groomed the two of you
from birth to run his company
and he managed to raise
a stellar successor.
I admired your father.
He took one small computer company
and he turned it into all of this.
He was a brilliant man.
Yeah, well, too bad
you weren't man enough to say it
to his face when he was alive.
- Walt.
- No. All this man ever did was torment Dad.
- Walter...
- You'd rather climb into your damn grave
than watch two brothers
beat you at your own game.
Good day, gentlemen.
- Mr. Brunson. Sir. Wait.
- I've never been so insulted in my life.
Sir, if you could just give us a minute.
(SIGHS)
- What is wrong with you?
- What? All I said was the truth!
You want to see all of Dad's things sold,
everything he worked for, at auction?
Is that what you want?
Dad would not want to see his son
in here begging!
What are you... Who was begging?
He wasn't begging!
Shut up, John.
Well.
- Hey, how you doing?
- First name?
Uh, Lindsey. L-I-N-D-S...
You got it.
- Go on in.
- No, I can't stay right now.
Then why are you in this line?
Well, see, I was just wondering.
I know you have to be here by 5:00,
but I don't get off work till 11:00.
So I was just praying that you could
hold a spot for me and my daughter.
- It's against the rules.
- Please.
How old is your daughter?
Six.
Honey, have you ever been
in a shelter before?
- No, I haven't.
- You should try the Petrie House.
- They take women and kids.
- Yeah, I know.
I did, and they're full.
So this is it, you know?
Okay, knock around back at 11:00,
ask for Jerry.
Tell him Denise said
it was okay for you to stay.
And, honey, this is no hotel.
Keep your belongings close
and your daughter closer, you hear?
Thank you.
- First name?
- Lauren.
Go in.
- Lonnie.
- Go on in.
- First name?
- Renee.
You're upset, aren't you?
Where is your mother?
She'll be here.
When you come to school,
you're very hungry.
Are you eating at home?
Sometimes.
Why not all the time?
Something wrong with the stove?
No. It's...
You can tell me.
I don't want my mommy to get into trouble.
She won't get in any trouble.
We sleep in the car.
(CAR APPROACHING)
It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.
Thank you for waiting, really.
Can I talk to you for a second?
It's not a great day.
Ariel was telling me
the two of you are homeless.
What?
I don't know, she got an imagination.
And all that stuff in the car
is her imagination?
You know what? We're good. Thank you.
Ms. Wakefield, I will have to call...
I will have to call Child Welfare
if you don't talk to me!
- I gotta go!
(ENGINE NOT STARTING)
What's the matter with you?
Why would you tell her that?
I'm sorry, Mom.
I mean, do you want them
to take you from me?
- No.
- 'Cause I'm telling you
that is exactly what'll happen
if you go around saying
those kind of things to people, come on!
'Cause I'm only telling you
for your own good!
Now have you got it?
Yes.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Oh! Oh...
Damn it!
Where did you go, baby?
- Hey. Where you running to?
- No. I...
Please, please, listen. No, no, no.
I want to talk to you for just a second.
- Please, just let me go!
- No, no.
She's in my office. No, no, Lindsey.
Lindsey.
- Did I tell you not to move?
- Lindsey, Lindsey.
- She knows not to...
- Listen.
She didn't move, I found her.
I made her come with me, okay?
She didn't leave.
Oh, God, did you call Child Welfare?
- No.
(SIGHS) Thank you. Thank you.
But I should have.
Lindsey, what is wrong with you?
What kind of mother does this?
I don't understand what kind of mother
would leave her kid in a car...
I had to take this new shift
and I don't have a babysitter.
Sure, I get it. You don't
have a babysitter.
But there's surely someone in your family
who can be a caregiver to this child.
No.
No, we don't have family.
Don't you think
I would have done that already?
What about this boyfriend, the one
that was gonna help you with the car?
We broke up.
- Is that the truth?
- Can you let me go to my kid?
No, no, no. Look.
I had to drag her out of that closet.
She was scared to death.
Shaking. Because she was so worried about
what you would say
or what you would do to her.
How often are you hitting her?
I would never do that.
All right, we're just going through
a rough time right now.
And I don't like it,
but she has to learn to be responsible.
You see how ridiculous you sound?
She's six years old.
She's six!
How can she be responsible at six?
That's like my parents.
You're comparing her to you?
She doesn't have a silver spoon
in her mouth.
You just don't get it!
You're the kind of guy who leaves
a $10 tip for a $20 bill!
I want you to calm down,
'cause I've had just about enough of you...
- You just don't understand.
- ...this talk about me and my privilege...
- We live in the real world.
- ...and where I come from. And I don't?
No, you do not.
Tell me,
how much does a gallon of milk cost?
You don't even know.
Or a gallon of gas.
When's the last time
you worried about paying a bill?
Ariel.
You're not...
- Come on.
- I'm tired.
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)
(DOG BARKING)
(SIREN WAILING)
(HELICOPTER PASSING)
- Lindsey?
- Yeah, Jerry?
Yeah, come on in.
(WHISPERING) Just follow me, all right?
Look, it's lights out,
so you want to be quiet, okay?
Yeah.
All right, the rest room's
right down there, okay?
You guys are over here on this side.
There's your bed, right there.
All right?
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.
(WHISPERING)
Mommy, who are all these people?
Just lay down.
- All right?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You're up late.
- And so are you.
Yeah, there's a lot going on at the office.
You want to talk about it?
No. I'll get it all worked out.
You were pretty drunk last night.
Sorry.
Don't apologize. I was just, uh...
I don't think I've ever
seen you that drunk.
I don't think
I've ever been that drunk before.
Is there a reason why?
Work.
The real estate market is crap right now.
The wedding, the engagement party,
and it's all been
a little overwhelming, and I guess
I just wanted to let my hair down.
- Anything I can do?
(CHUCKLES) No, baby, I'll...
I'm gonna be fine, don't worry about me.
Dang it!
What's that?
- Really?
- What?
What?
A blonde hair? In our bed?
- There's no way.
- No. It's a long, blonde hair.
Looks like it's brown to me.
No, no, it's blonde, like a blonde woman.
It's a curly, brown hair.
- Like I don't know a blonde hair?
- Oh.
I know blonde women.
- I know they have...
- Okay.
I know what blonde hair looks like.
Blonde, brown, whatever.
And it's in our bed.
(LAUGHS)
You don't think I had some woman
in the bed, now, do you?
No. No, I was gonna say
Maria needs to tell the dry cleaners,
"Be more careful."
Hmm.
Babe, how much is a gallon of milk?
I don't know. You're lactose intolerant.
(GASPS)
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)
You're gonna wake that baby!
(SCREAMING) No! Stop!
Get up! Get up, baby, get up!
Come! Come on, come on!
(SHUSHING)
How can you be so sure?
What, baby?
That I'm not cheating.
You know, a little jealousy
might be nice, Natalie.
Baby, you always do the same thing.
Are you saying I'm boring?
No.
No, I'm saying that you eat
the same thing every day,
you go to work the same time every day,
when we make love,
you do it the same way every time.
I'm saying you're predictable.
- Wesley.
- Morning, John.
Hit me with it. What'd he say?
Well, he and his wife were
extremely offended by Walt,
but they have the offer.
Did he seem interested at all?
Uh, no.
As a person who's advised you
for the last few years
and your father for two,
I have to ask you something.
I hate it when you come in with
this advisory tone early in the morning.
You think your brother's
trying to sabotage you?
No. I don't.
Wesley, all I'm gonna say is
that he wants to run this place.
So if you fail, he can tell everybody
that he was right and your father was wrong
for giving you the position.
- Hey!
- What?
- You didn't pick me up.
I waited 20 minutes out there for you.
Well, just give me my damn keys
and I'll drive myself, Wes.
I'm not giving you your keys
and you know why.
I'll talk to you later.
You do that, John.
What are you trying...
Mr. Deeds, this was left
on my desk for you.
Who's Lindsey?
Thank you, uh, April.
Who's this? Hmm?
Who's Lindsey?
She's the night janitor.
Night janitor.
So why's she leaving you messages?
You screwing her?
Why don't you just go to work, Walter?
Wait, are you still mad at me
about yesterday? You...
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day, all right?
I can't stomach people disrespecting us
to our face, Wes.
Nobody was disrespecting you,
you were disrespectful to them.
I can do better. You want me to call them?
I'll call Brunson and I'll smooth it over.
That's the last thing you're gonna do.
All right, so then what would you
like me to do, CEO?
Why don't you just go to work, Walter?
(EXHALES)
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day, all right?
I can't stomach people disrespecting us
to our face, Wes.
Nobody was disrespecting you,
you were disrespectful to them.
