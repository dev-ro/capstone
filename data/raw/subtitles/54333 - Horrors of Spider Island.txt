[MUSIC PLAYING]
Here's Singapore in
the south of Malayer,
population
approximately 550,000.
University, shipbuilding,
important seaport.
Doesn't it say anything
about the 32 nightclubs there?
Have you already worked
down in Singapore?
Not to work.
However, I once had a
friend, an oil sheik.
He took me with him down there.
He was quite a guy.
Those are the guys that run
around in turbans, aren't they?
Listen honey, when they
take those turbans off,
they're just like any other man.
Got a light?
Uh.
Looking forward to
going to Singapore?
Mm.
I don't really
care where I dance
as long as the pay is good.
That's him now.
Hi.
Hi.
I've already been to Singapore.
And you look like it.
Oh dear.
Ah.
Hello, Gary.
Hi, Georgy.
You're looking
prettier every day.
How in the world are you doing?
Mike.
Yeah?
Have you told the girls
what this is all about?
Sure, Gary.
A tour for a dancing troupe.
First engagement Singapore.
I have 12 of them
here to pick from.
OK, Georgia.
Let the girls in.
We don't have much time.
All right if we start
now, Mr. Blackwood?
Of course.
Oh, but one at a time, please.
OK.
May.
Smile will you?
How do you do?
That's Mr. Webster,
the manager.
And this is May.
She's the finest dancer in town.
What was your last engagement?
With the Coquettes, one year.
Ah, one of the finest.
Hm.
Legs?
Pardon me?
Mr. Webster would like
to look at your legs.
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
You're hired.
Please wait outside.
Oh, thank you.
Hm.
May, Coquettes.
And this is Rhonda Hunter.
Dancer?
Not really.
But I pick things up real fast.
Hm.
Thank you.
We're looking for dancers.
But what's that got
to do with Singapore?
Come on.
Come on, honey.
Don't hold us up.
Babs.
This is Babs.
Her legs are worth
their weight in gold.
Can those golden
legs also dance?
I was solo dancer in
the Apollo variety.
And why did you leave there?
Well the boss
really went for her,
but his wife thought otherwise.
All right.
You can work with us, as long
as you don't have any affairs.
Mr. Webster doesn't
tolerate any fooling around.
I had all the boys I can take.
Come on.
Carolyn.
This little one's from
the National Ballet.
Could you dance a
little bit for us?
Glad to.
Would you put this
one on for me?
Sure.
Let's have a look.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Thank you, Carolyn.
You dance wonderfully,
but I'm afraid ballet
is not what we're looking for.
Hm.
Don't be sad, honey.
I tell you what, come
in again tomorrow.
Yeah?
Yeah, I've got
something else for you.
Oh thanks.
All right.
Here are Gladys and Dorine.
I told you to let
them in separately.
These babes been working from
the start as a duo number.
And we would very much like
to stay together if possible.
On this tour you'll be
dancing with other girls.
That doesn't matter as long
as we get to go overseas.
All right.
You can both work with us.
Please send the next one in.
Thank you.
See you.
Linda.
Hello there.
Mm.
You're a stripper?
At times.
Didn't I see you work the
Sapphire Club last month?
How observant of you.
How come you quit that place?
The boss wanted to.
I didn't.
Oh, are you always
so picayunish?
That depends on the boss, Boss.
Shall I dance for you?
It's not necessary.
You're hired.
Wait outside.
OK.
Next girl please.
My name is Nelly Hastings.
A new one.
I haven't seen her
work yet, but she's
always been with good troops.
Let's see her dance.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Thank you.
You're hired.
Please wait outside.
So Mr. Blackwood has supplied
all the girls we need.
Fine, Georgia.
Go and tell the
girls when costume
and dance rehearsals will start.
Will you please?
GEORGIA: All right.
Listen, Gary.
I thought you were
the boss, but you
let Georgia select
all the girls.
I select all the girls.
You?
But you didn't say a word.
Why should I?
I have a little trick.
When I keep my
legs apart like so,
it means I'm not interested.
When I cross them like
this, ah, then it's OK.
You always were a crazy guy.
When do things get under way?
Oh, 10 days.
10 days?
Well then, have a good trip.
Thank you.
PILOT (ON RADIO):
We are now flying
over the Pacific
Ocean near Honolulu.
Altitude is 15,000 feet.
May day.
May day.
May day.
Clipper 247.
Clipper 247.
We are 9,000 feet
and losing altitude.
Number two engine burning.
Rough weather.
Attempting emergency landing.
Present position is...
Repeat your position.
Repeat your position.
Damn.
I can't pick them up anymore.
Clipper 247.
[SCREAMING]
No, Mr. Hastings.
I can only repeat.
There's absolutely no reason
yet to fear the worst.
Until now we only know
that the plane caught fire,
and that we've
lost radio contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll let you
know immediately
as soon as I hear something new.
[PHONE RINGING]
Blackwood Agency.
No, Mr. Roberts.
I don't have any
further information.
But of course there's a
search party out there.
I tell you, rescuers are
looking all over for them.
There's still hope
even after four days.
Yes.
I'll call you as soon
as I hear something new.
[CRYING]
Will you stop that bawling?
You're driving us all nuts.
Water.
Just one swallow.
No more today.
Tomorrow you'll
get another ration.
Gary, give me some water.
Huh.
Who do you think you are?
The fifth night.
We can't hold out much longer.
You're starting
that too, Georgia?
A ship has to go
by here some time.
Or we've got to at
least see some land.
Water.
Please give me water.
Look.
A bird.
Where there are birds,
there must be land.
Are you crazy?
Give that to me.
Look there, Gary.
Over there.
Land.
There's land.
Help me paddle.
We've got to make it.
Paddle with your hands.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't stop now.
We'll make it.
It's not far now.
Then we'll be safe.
Oh, I can't go on anymore.
Oh, I'll help you.
Oh.
There you are, Georgia.
Lie down.
Thanks.
I can't go any longer.
Babs.
Kate.
There.
Georgia, darling.
Oh, Gary.
Oh, Gary.
Gary.
Water.
Ah.
Water.
Water!
Water!
Is that Gary?
Come on!
Come on!
Come one!
Water.
How wonderful.
Oh let's go.
Come on girls.
Water.
Oh wonderful.
Come on.
Fresh drinking water.
It's spring.
[CHATTER]
Oh, is anything more
wonderful than water?
OK, girls.
That's enough.
Let's go and have a look around.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Georgia.
Ready?
Let's go.
That was good.
Feeling better now?
Shoot.
Don't lag behind.
I'll help you.
Thanks.
Heels are too high for here.
Kate, your scarf.
Oh, keep it.
Coming?
Ow.
Ouch.
Careful girls.
Oh these branches.
Listen.
What a strange silence.
Well let's keep going.
I wonder how much further
we're gonna have to go.
Ouch.
My shoe.
Gary!
Look what I just found.
What?
A hammer.
There must be someone
on this island.
A hammer with a long handle.
It must be for the
purpose of excavating
some sort of metal,
most probably uranium.
Can you eat that?
Yeah, you could try it.
Come on.
Let's go and find out.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Look.
A cabin.
[CHATTER]
[SCREAMS]
Let's get out of here.
A dead man in a huge web.
Oh, Gary.
Hey there.
Do you think we should?
I don't know.
Come on.
The poor professor.
When he made the last
entry in the diary,
he didn't know how
horribly he would die.
Well his discovery of
the uranium deposits
didn't help him
any, even if it does
represent a tremendous fortune.
We must keep it from the
girls that Professor Green
had a premonition of his fate.
You see here in
the last paragraph?
He says he thought something
terrible was going to happen.
He just felt the danger.
I wonder where that
peculiar hissing
came from that he always heard?
Oh, Gary, I'm terribly scared.
I'm so afraid.
Don't worry, Georgia.
As long as I'm around
nothing will happen to you.
I promise.
Hi, Georgia.
I'm hungry.
I've made something
for you to eat.
Lucky there was some
canned goods here.
Mm.
Food.
It must have been a
really gigantic spider
to be able to spin
such a huge web.
Maybe there are more of them.
[DOOR KNOB TURNING]
[GASPS]
We found the professor's
trunk full of stuff.
They'll certainly be useful.
1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
OK.
If we divide the
provisions up carefully,
they should last for a month.
What did you say, Georgia?
A month?
Do you really think we'll
be here a whole month?
I don't know.
We have to go tomorrow
to the highest cliff
and light a smoke signal
to try and attract a ship.
10, 11, 12.
Give me that shirt.
No it belongs to me.
After all, I found it.
But my dress is in
worse shape than yours.
No.
I want to have it.
Give it to me!
That's mine!
Stop that fighting.
Give me that shirt.
Georgia.
Thanks, Gary.
I suppose we could have
guessed that Georgia
would be getting it.
Haven't you ever noticed
that Gary pampers her?
What's this?
Where did you get the pull over?
I found it here, if you don't
have anything against it.
Ha.
Now stop it, or I'll
take care of both of you.
Give me something
to drink, Gladys.
Hm.
Take it easy, Gary.
We're all a little nervous.
It's really no wonder.
Don't you think I'd rather
be in a bar in Singapore
with a nice cold drink, than to
be on this God forsaken place
drinking this horrible stuff?
Buh.
Darn heat.
Look out will you?
And stop making so much noise.
If you don't like it,
you can do the dishes.
Or do you think I'm doing
this for my own pleasure?
Stop blowing your top
and dry up, will you?
I simply can't stand this
frightful heat any longer.
How about throwing your
dirty blouse some place else?
I want to sleep.
I sure hope you don't
lose your lipstick.
You'd hardly be able to
get along on this island
without it.
[KNOCKING]
I'm through.
It's about time.
Now I'll shower.
Give it here.
Come on.
Come on, girls.
Let's go to sleep.
I'm going to sleep outside.
Me too.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Kate.
Good.
I found the
professor's revolver.
Get some sleep, Gary.
I can't.
I think I'll go out
for a little walk.
But don't worry.
I'll be back very shortly.
Gary.
Oh, Gary.
Gary.
Damned heat.
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore.
[THUNDER]
[GUN SHOTS]
Those were shots!
I heard them clearly.
Oh, I hope nothing's
happened to Gary.
Ah!
Ah!
I'm going.
And if you're not going
with me, I'm going alone.
Stay here!
Don't leave us alone.
You won't find Gary.
[SCREAMS]
Oh just leave
everything as it is.
We must find Gary.
Babs and Ann, you go
in that direction.
Where in the world is Kate?
Here, Georgia.
You two go in that direction.
Kate and May will
go along with me.
[CHATTER]
What about me?
You?
You remain here.
And put things in
order while we're gone.
Huh.
[WHISTLING]
Hey.
Gary.
Would you quit that whistling?
You're making me nervous.
I'm not afraid when I whistle.
Gary.
Gary.
Gary.
Gary.
Gary.
Gary.
Gary.
Come on.
We've got to keep looking.
Without me.
I'm staying right here.
[HISSING]
Did you hear anything?
No.
But there's something
moving there.
I don't hear anything.
Gary.
Hey Gladys.
Don't leave me alone.
Then hurry up.
Gary.
Gary.
Gary!
Gary!
Gary!
Gary!
[SCREAM]
I heard a scream.
I heard it plainly.
The scream came from there.
Linda!
How awful.
She's been strangled.
The spider.
[CRYING]
Ann.
Ann.
Oh it's horrible.
Oh Georgia, the
professor's been killed.
Gary's disappeared, and now
we've just buried Linda.
Which one of us is
going to be next?
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
Ann.
Ann.
Now stop it, will you?
Stop it, before you
drive us all crazy.
Not me.
Not me.
And I tell you
they'll never find us.
Never.
But I'm sure the
police is moving
heaven and hell
to find us, honey.
The police?
The cops I know, if they catch
you speeding a little bit
or find you drunk, they send
you right out to the cooler.
But you just let
somebody get lost,
and they won't lift a finger.
Do you believe that
they'll go running around
for a few broads who are lost?
But how were they to know
that we've been rescued
and on this little island?
Rescued?
Who's been rescued?
We perhaps?
Show me the island.
Show me.
Where does it lie in the ocean?
Show it to me!
By the time they find
us, we'll all be dead.
You, you, and you.
One after the other.
Babs!
Get a hold of yourself.
You're only getting all
the girls worked up.
Well, if it isn't Miss Georgia.
Of all people it has to be you.
Who has Gary and Linda
on her conscience?
Who?
Babs, do you know
what you're saying?
Exactly.
Through your jealousy.
You should never have left
Linda alone in the cabin.
Shut up, will you?
What can Georgia do
about Linda's death?
Take your hands off me,
or I'll break your arm.
Just you try that, baby.
Take that.
Ya!
Uh.
Stop it!
Babs, Milly, stop it!
Babs.
Stay here.
Let them fight.
[SCREAM]
Come!
Come!
Is the ship getting any closer?
I don't know.
Come on.
Throw it on.
Should I get some more?
No.
No that's enough.
That's giving enough smoke.
They must see us.
They can't just leave us here.
Hello!
Hello!
Stop all that screaming, Ann.
You're driving me crazy.
Let me go.
Hello!
Take us with you!
Hello!
We're over here!
Please don't forget us!
Yell with me.
They must hear us.
Hello!
Hello there!
Take us with you!
May, it sailed right by.
It sailed by.
We'll never get home now.
Never again.
28 days.
28 long days and nights.
And nobody even
knows we're here.
And today a ship
sales right by us.
Our rescue so close.
Ann, May.
Oh Georgia.
A ship.
There.
A ship.
Oh it's gone.
How terrible.
And we only have enough
food left for three days.
Ann.
Ann.
Come on back.
Come on, Ann.
Here.
You go ahead and
start unloading.
I'll take the oars up.
OK, Bob.
What are you carrying
the oars so far away for?
Afraid the mermaids
will steal our boat?
Huh.
Don't talk to me about women
on this God forsaken island.
Should have taken one along
as part of your ration.
I wanted to, but
it wasn't approved.
Hey, come on over here and
give me a hand, will you?
OK.
I'm coming.
Take it easy.
Easy now.
Boy that junk is heavy.
Bob, you know, I'm sort
of glad the professor
picked us out to help
him with his work,
even though it's
lonely over here.
Give me some whiskey.
If there aren't any chicks,
then at least some whisky.
You only think about
whisky and women.
You better change, or
you'll never get any place.
Get off my back.
I'm sick of your preaching.
Take the professor for example.
That guy's always been lucky.
Well we explore all sorts
of islands for six months.
He comes with us once
and find the stuff.
And of all places on
this miserable island.
Careful now.
Stop grumbling, will you?
Ah, go on.
I'll go look for
the professor now.
OK.
Get on out of here, will you?
In the meantime, I'll unload.
And have fun.
Yeah, sure.
[GIGGLING]
[SCREAMS]
Gladys!
Gladys!
Quick girls.
We're in danger.
Make for the beach.
We can't leave her here.
So that all of
us will be killed?
Let's go.
Come on.
Look over there.
How terrible.
The web in the cabin.
The gun.
Gary took it with
him that night.
And this is his bracelet.
But where is Gary?
Please Georgia, let's go.
I'm so afraid.
Perhaps there are
more spiders around.
Come and sit with me.
What do you want from me?
Well, give you three guesses.
I was going to ask
you for the time.
Georgia!
Georgia!
Here we are.
Gladys is gone
down by the lagoon.
We were swimming when suddenly
she was pulled into the reef.
Then she screamed badly.
Who was it?
Didn't you see anyone?
No, it all happened so quickly.
The scream?
And she'd already disappeared.
Maybe the spider killed
professor and Linda.
We found a gigantic spider.
Dead.
It was shot with the
professor's own revolver.
And Gary's bracelet was
laying there beside it.
[FOOT STEPS]
What's that noise?
That's him.
Get back.
Quiet.
Hands up.
Stop or I'll shoot.
Hey, Hey.
Hello, baby.
Hands up.
Anything you wish.
Get going into the cabin.
What a coincidence.
That's where I wanted to go.
I said, get going.
All righty.
I think he's handsome.
He doesn't look so terrible.
They're the really
dangerous ones.
Too bad.
OK.
Turn around.
Hm.
Where's Gladys?
What did you do with her?
Let me speak to him.
Where is Gladys?
Gladys?
No idea.
I don't know the young
lady, unfortunately.
We just got here
down on the lagoon.
You see, Georgia?
Where we were swimming.
And that's where
Gladys disappeared.
On the lagoon?
Ah.
[LAUGHING]
Don't laugh.
You'll be sorry about that.
Oh, I don't know.
Just look at what's
coming down the path.
Gladys.
[CHATTER]
Who's that?
My friend Bob.
We work together
for Professor Green.
Oh, he's a big
uranium research man.
I met him before in the reeds.
A researching researcher.
Then you had better luck
than I. I was nearly shot.
Hi there.
That is, if the
revolver had been loaded.
And you?
You here on a summer vacation?
Hm.
Fine summer vacation.
If we hadn't found
this island, we
wouldn't be here
to tell the story.
We crashed on our
way to Singapore.
Ah, then you're the American
dance troupe that got lost.
Yes.
Well, how do you know that?
Well all the newspapers in the
world have carried your story.
What?
I bet Professor
Green was surprised
when all these girls showed up.
Ha ha.
Professor Green is dead.
What's with the professor?
Dead?
What?
He was hanging in
a huge spider web.
That's how we found him.
Linda is dead, and Gary, our
manager has also disappeared.
Spider web?
Do you really believe that?
By the way, our ship is
coming back in two days.
We must radio information right
away, so that they can send
an agent to clear the matter up.
You mean it?
A ship's coming by?
Our expedition ship.
And it will take us with it?
Yeah, of course.
We're rescued.
[CHATTER]
Look, isn't this pretty?
The boys will be surprised,
when they see how we've dressed
ourselves up in our
island costumes.
And they promised us
real whiskey, kids.
I can hardly wait.
Hold this.
Shall I put this in my hair.
You look great just
like a real islander.
Well, I am.
Haven't I been here
for four weeks?
I can't believe
that we'll be back
in New York in a couple of days.
When we tell them at home
what has happened to us,
nobody's going to believe us.
Where are Georgia and Ann?
Outside on the veranda.
They're out there
with Joe trying
to make radio contact
with the expedition ship.
I wonder if a lot
of reporters will
be on board when we get there?
Hope so.
What's important for me
is that Jimmy's there.
Who is Jimmy?
My friend.
We're going to be married.
What if he's got
eyes for another?
You don't believe
that yourself.
I'd scratch his eyes
out, and he knows it.
Kids!
We made radio contact
with the ship,
and we'll be picked up tomorrow.
And tonight we'll dance
and really raise the roof.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Tell me, what kind
of a girl is Ann?
Usually quiet and
one of the nicest.
She's away from home
for the first time.
Her folks live in Minnesota.
I've never seen her so relaxed.
I'd like to dance with her.
Mhm.
Come on, Bobby.
I want to be all alone with you.
How about the house?
Not in the house.
Some place where
we'll be all alone.
You know what?
We'll meet at the lagoon.
OK.
But so that no one will notice.
Good.
We'll meet in 15 minutes in
the trail down to the water.
All set?
Of course.
Uh, but be on time.
I hate waiting.
Thanks.
[WHISTLES]
Having a good time
with the chicks?
Shut your mouth.
Falling for her?
Huh.
Thank you.
Tell me, are you
always so quiet?
You know, when you've lived
on islands for a long time,
you forget how to say
nice things to girls.
Well, try it once.
Well, I'm really glad
that your airplane crashed.
Well, that's a
nice thing to say.
I mean, I mean otherwise
I wouldn't have gotten
to know you, and
I'm glad about that.
Oh, you say that to everybody.
No, Ann.
I don't know any girls.
And when I think of the
ones I do, I'd rather work.
Well I must say,
you certainly are
a master at paying complements.
Perhaps you're,
perhaps you're right.
I should pay more
attention to young women.
Sometimes I envy Bob.
He's so uninhibited
and carefree.
Bob?
Any girl is good enough for him.
A real man is interested
in only one girl.
Then I'm a, then
I'm a real man.
How?
Because I'm really
interested only in one girl.
Who's that?
What does she look like?
Cute?
Elegant?
Elegant?
Mm.
On the contrary.
A little bit disheveled and
neglected, but uh, very pretty.
Her name's Ann.
Oh, Joe.
That's one of the nicest things
that's ever been said to me.
Well I meant it.
I'm really fond of you.
You know, when you leave
for New York, here,
so you won't forget
me too quickly.
But Joe, please don't
let me wait too long.
Come on.
I've got 12 minutes left.
What's in 12 minutes?
My next rendezvous.
Hello, big boy.
Well, I'll be darned.
That's not bad either.
Hey, all right.
You really don't know
where to start here.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Gladys.
Oh.
What's on your mind, huh?
Nothing.
In love?
Mhm.
And you really think that
Bobby's the right man for you?
I don't know.
I only know one thing.
I love him.
I hope he doesn't let you down.
I'd be very sorry for you.
Hello, Daddy-o.
How about throwing those lamps
on somebody else for a change?
Yeah, baby.
Like you swing too.
Come on, Gladys.
It's not worth it.
Don't bother me.
Hey, Georgia.
Get me a drink too.
All right.
Thanks.
Bobby.
Yeah?
Do you have to turn
all the girls' heads?
Who me?
They turn mine.
Hm.
Hi, Georgia.
Hi.
That dance sure
made me thirsty.
Georgia, aren't you at all
excited about going home soon?
Mhm.
OK.
Let's drink to that.
Yeah.
Well, here's to the trip.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Do you think people are
still talking about us?
Of course, now all the
more since we found you.
Will the papers
print our story?
Oh baby, will the
paper print your story?
The magazines will
carry your pictures.
And what do you think radio
and TV will do with you?
You'll be amazed
at the reception
you get back in New York.
Maybe they'll drive us down
Broadway with confetti and all.
Hm.
In any case, you'll become
a world famous truth.
And who knows?
Maybe you'll wind
up in Hollywood.
Oh Bobby, I might make it yet.
Thank goodness I still
have a few minutes left.
Because my next rendezvous
is very important.
And this time
who's the lucky one?
If you won't tell
anyone, Gladys.
Bobby, Gladys is a fine girl.
Up until now she's
been shy of men.
Please, leave her alone.
Exactly.
I've always yearned
for a girl like this.
And I've never found one.
Why am I telling
you all this anyway?
Oh, Joe.
I'm so happy.
Well that's what I expected.
Same old story.
You're nice to a man,
and before you know it,
he's getting fresh.
Ann, I must tell you
something right away.
Come on.
Hey, Ann.
Let her run.
They're all good for nothing.
They're all the same.
Come on.
Let's have a drink.
Well Gladys, it's just
as I told you earlier.
Well don't you see that Bob is
just the kind of man who wants
nothing else then to
play around with women
without a single serious
thought in his head.
You're right.
I don't want to see him again.
Good.
Look, Bob.
You can keep those remarks
about Ann to yourself.
Get it?
Don't tell me are
you're serious, fella.
You haven't fallen for that
little broad by any chance.
Well good luck then.
And what if I were?
Then I'd feel sorry for you.
What are dancers?
Hot goods for cold nights?
Or you think your
Ann is different?
For a guy like you the worst
girl in the world is too good.
No.
Not here.
Come on.
[LAUGHING]
I got to run.
I got a date.
OK.
Hello, Gladys.
Oh leave me alone, you.
What's the matter
with you, kid?
Have you gone crazy?
You ask me that?
No man in this world, even if
he belonged to your best friend,
would be safe with you around.
Are you talking about Bobby?
Who.
Else?
But you can keep him.
I'm through with him.
I've got news for you.
Bobby just made it clear to me
that you're the kind of girl
that he's been looking for.
Do you mean that Babs?
If it weren't true do
you think I'd leave him?
Babs!
Go to him.
He's waiting for you.
Bobby.
[GASPS]
[SCREAMS]
That was a, a scream.
[SCREAM]
It sounded like Gladys.
And Bobby's also gone.
I'll look for them.
You get dressed and follow me.
[GUN CLICKING]
You go up ahead and
try to help Gladys.
I'll go back and
get the ammunition.
Quick!
[SCREAM]
Bob.
Bobby.
Joe!
Georgia.
Where's the ammunition?
I don't know.
Maybe there.
Quick, or we'll all get it.
I found Bob, dead.
Was he strangled?
Where are the bullets?
It's too late.
He's here.
Gary!
Uh!
Uh!
All right.
Come on.
Come on.
We must surround him.
Two of you take that
path over there.
Two go through the bushes.
The rest of you, come with me.
Nobody should go alone.
Always go in pairs.
Come on.
Come on.
He's over there.
Come.
There he is.
Maybe we've lost him.
Stop!
The quick sand starts here.
Oh, Joe.
He's sinking.
Ah!
Better dead than
continue living.
