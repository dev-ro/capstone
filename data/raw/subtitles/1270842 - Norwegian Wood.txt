Company Esmik Ice Entertainment 
Presents
Norwegian Wood
Here, give it to me.
Naoko and Kidzuki were together
almost since birth.
And I was Kidzuki's best friend
So we were almost always together
I lost... I'll have to pay
After Kidzuki's death
...I decided to move away from this city
Somewhere, where I didn't know anyone
And forget about everything that happened.
The myth of Andromah tells
about an unbreakable love and the resulting
reaction of its tragic consequences.
University of Baseda is protesting, because
today, there is nothing more important than the liquidation
Of American bases on Okinawa
And the end of the Vietnam war!
We call to end the lecture and give
us time for political discussions!
We've collected too many problems
That are more serious than Greek tragedies
I don't think, that there are problems in the world
more serious than those in Greek tragedies.
But do as  you will.
After I moved to Tokyo, I for some time
got heavily into reading books.
Life stopped and became empty
like the field of pages before my eyes.
That will be ten thousand yen.
Vatanabe! It's already 6:30!
Instead of sitting with your books until morning
go to sleep earlier.
And when the sun comes up, you could exercise with me.
Nagasava!
Is it true that you fucked
already 100 girls?
Garbage
Maybe, 70, but no more.
I just want one right now.
Next time, you'll come with me.
No issue
Everything will work out for you.
Nagasava with a strange
way, pulled me in.
A refined nature, which
is impossible to catch with anything
Sorry,
Life is short.
There's no sense in wasting time on books
in a sense of time is absent.
What do you say, let's drink?
This guy managed to be
a sharp esthet
And at the same time a pervert
I... Sat over there, and...
What are you doing in Tokyo?
What am I doing?
How about we take a walk...
Is everything okay?
You're quiet.
I don't know how to talk a lot...
Sorry.
That's alright, I'm also not a talker.
Where are we?
Same place we came from.
We circled around.
You're tough!
Surprised?
Yea.
Can I call you
Say, this Saturday.
Of course!
Give student's defiance!
Yankee, get out of Okinawa!
Shame on war in Vietnam!
Away with the contract of security!
Away, away away!
Every Sunday we met and
Walked where our eyes looked
Like we performed some kind of a 
ritual of calming of our souls
And we still didn't talk about the past.
The name Kidzuki was never
mentioned in our conversations.
You can look now.
Now you can.
How pretty!
Can I blow it out?
Oh, sorry! I'll be one second...
- Blow
- Go!
This is for you.
- For me?
- Yes.
Thanks.
It's nothing.
- Can I open it?
- Of course.
What a dumb birthday
It's so stupid, when you turn 20
And you're not ready for it at all.
You know, it's so strange
Like someone is pushing you from the back.
I still have 7 months.
I'll try to get ready.
Lucky! You're still 19..
To me, it seems, people should
get stuck between 18 and 19.
18 ends, you turn 19
19 ends, you become 18 again.
If only you could do that...
If that was possible,
it'd be so... easy.
What is this, first time?
That means, you never slept with Kidzuki?
Why?
Sorry...
I shouldn't have asked.
Sorry, but... I have to leave
You'll still call
When the owner of the apartment told me, that
Naoko moved, I was stunned
Then I wrote her a long letter
to her address in Kobe
hoping that it'd get routed to her
wherever she was
"Maybe, I shouldn't have treated you
like that on your birthday
Never in my life I felt
anything like that
Answer me.
I want to know, did I hurt you?
Vatanabe!
Cut your nose hairs.
You look horrible
You know, we're late!
I know, so what?
Hurry!
Hazumi knew, that Nagasava did nothing
other than sleep with whomever
But never complained about it
She truly loved him and didn't
give him any conditions
So? Want to find some girls
for the night?
Come on, let's party 100%.
What's with you?
Are you serious?
Seriously. From all the body parts
the elbow feels the least.
Hm.. interesting.
Aha.
"Wait, some day
we'll meet again"
Sorry, that I didn't answer for so long
I needed time, before I could
write to you
Though I am still not ready
to see you.
I came back to my parents from Tokyo
and there went to a hospital
The doctor says that in the mountains by Kyoto
there is a good sanitarium for me
I'm thinking of going there
for some time...
I'm very grateful that you 
were close to me.
Don't worry, you didn't hurt me.
I hurt myself.
I know".
You are Vatanabe, right?
Yes, why?
Can I sit here?
Or are you waiting for someone?
I'm not waiting for anyone.. Sit...
We've met before.
Evripid.
We had an entire semester
Don't remember?
Oh yea! Except before the break
your hair was to your shoulders, right?
Yea, but this summer I decided...
Turn sideways.
That looks really good on you.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.
Listen... Do you lie often
in life?
I try to do it as little as possible.
Where did you get that tan?
I traveled on foot for two
weeks in a row.
- By yourself?
- Yup.
Do you always travel by yourself?
Yes... always.
So you like being alone?
Who likes that; being alone?
I just try not to make friends
by force.
So that I'm not disappointed later.
You should definitely write about that
in your autobiography.
Are you making fun?
I just really like
the way you think.
My name is Midori.
Why do you need dark sunglasses?
My eyes are tired today.
I didn't get enough sleep.
And this too...
Sorry that I couldn't come
last time.
Did you wait long?
It's nothing. I have plenty
of free time.
Really?
I'm ready to share it with you,
so that you can get sleep.
You're so nice.
Yes! Open!
Can I?
Come in.
- Hi. This is for you.
- Thanks...
I'll go put the water on.
Isn't it too early?
No, of course not.
Is there a bookshelf
on your first floor?
Yea. For almost a thousand years.
I'm so happy that
you like my cooking.
Very tasty, honestly.
Tell me honestly, you didn't expect that?
Based on how I look,
I'd make a horrible chef.
Where are your relatives? Did they go somewhere?
My mom is in a grave.
Sister went with her husband
to ride around in a car, my dad...
He went to Uruguay last July.
Uruguay?
His old military friend bought
in Uruguay some fertile land.
My dad suddenly decided
that he could start a new life there.
Got on a plane and flew to Uruguay
Wow..
After mom's death
he lived in constant shock.
Before he left he said:
´It's too hard for me now,
I would have rather lost
both of you, than one of herª.
No way!?
We were so dumbfounded
we couldn't even answer.
But still, it's great when two people
love each other so strongly, no?
And there were no more news from him?
Only sometimes
he sent a postcard in march
He didn't write anything interesting in it.
On the postcard - some dumb donkey
I guess he went completely insane.
I used to often think, what would happen to me
if all of a sudden I lost my parents
But now, that it happened
I feel nothing.
No grief, no feeling hurt, no
feeling that I was abandoned
Do you think they didn't really love you?
Not truly.
But I would like to, at least once
feel true love.
What's true love for you?
For example, I tell you
"I want a tartalet with strawberries"
You drop everything, run, buy it
Then run back, breathing heavily
and give it to me.
And then I'll say
"I don't want it anymore"
And you'll throw that damn
tartalet through the window
That, that's what I call true love.
To me, it doesn't seem like it has anything
to do with real love
It does! I want for this person
to answer me
"I get it, Midori, sorry, my fault
I'm a total ass, a blockhead
 a dog without feelings
I'm going to bring you something else.
What do you want?
Chocolate mousse?
OR maybe cheesecake?
And then?
Then I will love him.
Tired?
That's not the issue.
It's just that it's been a long time
that I let myself relax, like now...
Actually... I am seeing someone.
For some reason, I thought so.
- Do you have someone you love?
- Yes.
es.
"Doctor tells me I have to begin
socializing with people from the world outside
But I don't remember from it 
any faces, but yours
I also have to explain something to you
It won't be possible
to escape it anyway
It's been four months since I've been here
And this whole time
I thought a lot about you.
I feel the warmth, which you
feel towards me
and I'm really, really happy about it.
know, if I somehow wronged you -
it's not only your pain,
it lives in me too".
Walk straight and don't turn.
Isida-sensei will meet you herself
I understand. Thanks
You - Vatanabe? You can call me
Reiko
Very glad. So, you're Naoko's doctor?
Doctor? What makes you think I'm a doctor.
I was told I'd be met by a sensei.
Oh... I see.
I teach music here
so everyone calls me "sensei"
But really, I'm one of the patients here
I've been here seven years already.
Can I come in?
Please do
It's cozy in here
In my dorm there's only ceiling
and a window
Really?
Will you be sleeping here?
Of course!
Me and Naoko still
have to work in the garden.
Will you wait for us here, okay?
Yes, of course. I'll study some German.
Got an exam next week.
Oh and..
You can't stay here with Naoko
by herself. It's forbidden.
There's always going to be some guarding you
it will be me.
You'll have to get used to it.
Ok.
- So, I'm going.
- See you soon.
Cute!
Yes. Great peaches!
I wanted to say it was cute
how you give the peaches
What now?
You asleep?
Nah... So, how are you?
We don't have much time.
Really, I'm not allowed to be here
but I snuck in.
Listen...
My hair is really horrible now, yea?
Not at all, what are you talking about?
Very beautiful hair.
My mom said they were horrible.
I wanted to see you so much.
Not even to tell you something
Just to see your face
get used to it.
How long have you been here
Thanks for coming
I'm very glad
But if it's hard for you here
don't be shy, tell me honestly, how it is
I won't be mad
If anything - be honest
I have to go.
Vatanabe... Sorry, could you go
and take a walk?
You don't love me
Love you.
A lot
Wake up, we need to talk
You asked me, why I never slept
with Kidzuki
Are you still interested in that?
- It'd probably be better if I know
- I think so to.
The dead, after all
won't come back
And we have to, somehow keep living
I wanted to sleep with Kidzuki
And he really wanted it too.
But no matter what we did,
nothing worked
It didn't work, and that's it!
I don't know, why
And I can't understand now.
I loved him.
But nothing worked.
I was really dry,
couldn't open my legs
It hurt so much.
What we didn't try...
All pointless, so I
just caressed him, how I could -
with my fingers, with my lips
I don't want to, I don't want to talk about it
But there's nothing I can do
I have to talk about it, because
by myself I can't figure it all out
After all, when I slept with you
I was really excited, you remember
Yes.
That evening of my birthday
I was wound up as soon as I saw you
wanted for you to grab me
tore off my dress, caressed me...
Never in my life
have I felt that.
Why?
Why?
Why is all this happening with me?
I did...
I loved Kidzuki!
Are you trying to say
you didn't love him?
Sorry!
Just know one thing:
Me and Kidzuki had
a very unique relationship
Me and him were always together
from when we three years old
We talked about everything
always understood one another
We grew up together like that.
And kissed
first time in sixth grade.
It was all so great.
And when I got my first period
I ran to him
cried on his shoulder
We were so close.
And after he died
I stopped understanding, how
it is possible to be with someone
And what it is - love...
naoko!
Come on, admit it, what
did you two do?
This time, in the woods, and 
you came back completely naked...
I can't tell you that...
We tried,
but nothing worked out for us.
What do you mean?
Vatanabe was so huge
that he didn't fit inside me
It's been 7 years
that I slept with anyone.
And I was tight inside
A?
Reiko had a dream
right before you came
Was I in your dream?
No, not you
Some unknown man.
Don't forget, we all
aren't really normal here
Yea..
Do you want me?
Yes, of course.
Are you ready to wait?
Of course I'm ready.
It's just that before it happens
I won't to pick myself up.
Will you be able to wait?
Of course I'll wait.
Is it really hard?
What, my boot?
Stupid..
If you're talking about my erection, then yes, of course.
Maybe you can stop saying
"yes, of course" all the time?
Okay. I won't.
It must be difficult?
What?
When it gets hard?
A?
I want to say -
does it torture you?
Sometimes, yes.
Want me to help?
- With your hand?
- Yes.
How warm!
You're good.
Be a good boy, be quiet...
- How long have you been here?
- The entire way.
Why are you so powered off?
Just tired from traveling.
Hey, Vatanabe!
Do you know what I want right now?
I can't even imagine.
I want to lay down
on a huge comfortable bed.
So that you were close and undressed me.
Very slowly, and gently..
So relaxing, that I turn off
then come back and scream!
´Stop, Vatanabe!
Stop
I like you a lot
But I'm seeing someone else.
I'm asking you, don't!"
But you're not stopping and
you take out of your pants your aggregate.
So huge, and hard...
So, you want that right now?
Oh yes.
Say, do all the guys, that live here
masturbate?
Probably, could you 
speak quieter?
When they do it, do they think
about girls?
I doubt that anyone masturbates
While thinking of budgets
or the Suez canal
Have you ever thought like that about me?
Hey! Tell me!
When you're not in lectures
do you spend your time here?
Yea.
And then you look
really tired.
Really?
Why?
Dad! It's me, Midori
how do you feel?
Dad! It's me, Midori
how do you feel?
Dad, I have to speak to the nurse.
I'll be back soon, okay?
- Can you stay with him for a little?
- Yes, of course.
Hello?
My dad died.
Can I help?
I don't need anything...
Thanks. I just wanted
you to know.
You don't have to come.
I hate funerals.
And I don't want you there.
Okay.. I understand.
Will you take me to see a porno-film?
Yes, of course.
The most perverse one.
I'll find something.
I'd rather my dad went to Uruguay.
That's true.
Would you go there
to visit me?
Yes, of course.
We would make
a bunch of healthy kids.
That doesn't sound bad...
You're so sweet, Vatanabe.
I'll call you.
Good.
What's with your hand?
I cut it at work.
Uh-uh...
So, I passed.
Exams to MID?
Congratulations!
Are you leaving Japan?
First year of study is here.
And then some time
overseas.
What are your plans about Hazumi?
So many years overseas.
What will happen to her?
That's her problem, not mine.
What do you mean?
Well, basically
I'm not going to marry anyone
and she knows that.
If she wants to marry someone
she can do that.
If she wants to wait -
she can wait for me, that's the deal.
- You think I'm shit?
- Yes.
Next time I'll come with her
you can talk to her.
You'll see, you'll like her!
It's pointless. I'm too poor
for girls from your college.
Don't be stupid.
This girl is really easygoing and not pretentious.
In the student cafeteria
they make three different lunches: A, B, or C
Lunch A costs 120 yen
Lunch B  - 100 yen, lunch C - 80 yen.
When I eat lunch A, everyone looks at me
like an enemy of the people.
Do you think we'd find
a common tongue?
Yea, just talk to her
once, can't be too hard.
You don't have to fuck her the first time.
What are you talking about!
You can't do that with her at all!
She's still a girl.
Vatanabe already has a girl he loves.
He just doesn't like to talk about it.
Is that so?
Yes... But I'm not hiding it at all.
It's just a difficult situation.
It's not easy to explain it all.
Too bad.. I was really hoping
to make a double date.
So that you could get drunk
and swap partners?
What nonsense you're saying!
No nonsense. Say, Vatanabe!
One time me and him
swapped girls.
Vatanabe? Is that true?
Come on, tell her...
I want to hear this story.
it's so interesting.
We were really drunk...
It's not an issue. I'm not accusing you of anything.
I just.. want to hear this story.
One time we got drunk in some bar
In sibuya and met two girls.
They were freshmen at some college
they were drunk too
So, we all went to the nearest hotel
and slept together.
Nagasava's room number and mine
turned out to be near each other.
During the night he knocked on my door
and offered to exchange girls.
So I went to his room
and he stayed in mine.
It was fun.
Yea... It was nothing special.
Why did you do it?
I talked him into it.
I'm asking Vatanabe.
Why did you want that?
Sometimes you really want to
sleep with a girl...
Listen, Vatanabe...
I don't know all your
circumstances, but...
It doesn't seem like your type of fun.
You're not that kind of person.
Do you agree?
Sometimes I think so to.
So? Why don't you stop
See, in full, the picture is like this.
Vatanabe is in love with a girl
But because of some reasons
they can't fuck.
She sees as just sex
and fulfills her instinct on the side
But if you really love her
can't you wait, Vatanabe?
You're probably right.
It's just a game.
No one lies
No one is hurt or insulted...
I'm insulted.
Why am I never enough for you?
You're enough for me...
Tell me, what are you thinking
about me and Nagasava?
Whatever I think
doesn't change anything.
Stop
Just say, what you are thinking, that's it.
If I was you, I'd dump him.
Nagasava isn't someone
who dreams to be happy
Or to make someone happy
You, Hazumi, you could find happiness
with practically anyone.
Why are you killing yourself
on someone like him?
It's impossible to explain things like that.
They just happen
and there's nothing you can do.
- You love him so strongly?
- I love him.
That must be so great.
To love someone so surely,
without the smallest doubt.
Two years after Nagasava went to Germany
Hazumi married.
And two years later she opened the veins
on her wrist and died.
- Sorry for yesterday.
- It's nothing.
I made up with Hazumi
Not surprised
She said you advised her
to dump her
Just like you wanted, no?
Vatanabe! Phone call for you.
Sorry, I'll be back.
Welcome
Sorry, I got held up. What are you drinking
"Tom Collins".
Whiskey and soda.
- Something happened?
- I cut myself a little bit at work.
- Where did you go?
- To Nara and Aomori.
What's it like at home?
Did you get tired with the funerals?
Not really.. Me and my sister
are used to that.
We decided to do what we're supposed to
and then, go where we want to.
I decided to visit my boyfriend in Nara
so he could fuck me.
And? Was it successful?
No, we didn't fuck once.
We barely got into the hotel
and I started my period...
Why are you laughing! It was a week
earlier than it's supposed to!
All that's left is to cry!
Your whiskey, please.
Both of us were so bursting..
We almost exploded
In the end, we fought a lot
and I haven't seen him since.
Came back to Tokyo, hung around a couple of days
doing nothing, and went to Aomori
- You've never been to Aomori?
- Never
So, the entire way
traveling by myself
I thought about you
and dreamed that you were there
Why?
"Why"? What do you mean "why"?
Why did you think about me?
Because I like you, you fool!
What other reasons can there be?
You have a guy
why think about me?
Stop saying mean things...
Listen, Vatanabe,
Guess what I want right now
I beg you.
Don't forget where we are!
I didn't even dream that you would answer like that
Midori! Come to the phone!
Forget it!
You have someone in Tokyo.
No.
If you get someone
Tell me right away, okay?
Yes, of course.
Ooh. Look at that.
"Reiko is still not eating
just smokes cigarette after cigarette
Fall is ending, there is almost
no work left in the garden
Just birds and rabbits
are playing around, like always
We pick mushrooms and chestnuts
every day
We cook them with rice
it is so tasty, never get tired of it!
the news from the big world confuse me
I can't figure them out.
But your letters
somehow always relax me.
Interesting, no?
Why is that?
Judging by your letters
Midori is a very interesting girl
I have this feeling
that she really likes you
Happy birthday to you.
I pray that your 20th year
will bring you you happiness.
It looks like my 20th year
will end not very happily
I'll be very happy if you could
be happy for me too
This scarf me and Reiko
knitted together
The good part - Reiko,
the bad part - mine.
Will you come see me
when the first snow falls?"
No!
I can't...
Don't.. I'm asking you.
Why did I give myself up to you
You have to live your life
and not get involved with people like, isn't that so?
No.. you're wrong.
I don't think so at all.
Maybe, you're just
lying to yourself?
Dump me.
Do that, which you should have done
on the day of me turning 20
Don't touch me!
Pervert!
- Get your hands!
- Naoko! Calm down!
Get out! Leave! Don't touch me!
Calm down! I'm asking you!
It hurts me
that you exist in this world!
Why can't you understand that?
Calm down!
Why?!
I'm thinking of leaving the dorm
and rent an apartment
I'd find a better job
find a way to make ends meet
Would you want to live there
with me?
Thanks...
I'm so happy
that you're offering that to me.
In a place like this, it's better not to
stay too long.
Think about it good
One way or another, I'm going to
move out, as soon as possible
And you can join me
when you want
Why can't I get turned on?
That happened only once.
Why?
It's just psychology...
With time everything will work like it needs to.
You don't have anything to worry about.
What if..
I will never be able to get turned don?
And until the end of my life
can't sleep with you?
Will you still love me?
I am by nature
a big optimist!
Once I move to my apartment
I'll immediately come to you
Think about what I said, okay?
Ok, bye...
I thought I'd get out of here
before you...
Do you want a good advice? for the future.
Let's hear it...
Never feel sorry for yourself.
Only degenerates feel bad for themselves.
I'll remember that.
"It must have been hard for you
to wait for Naoko's answer...
But for Naoko too, this month
ended up being really hard
She once against started hearing voice
It's hard for her to hold
a normal conversation
She doesn't want you to see
her in this shape..."
Listen...
I have something to talk to you about.
I have an important meeting.
It won't take a long time
A couple of minutes will be enough
And I don't want to talk to you
Sorry, of course.
"I'll tell you truthfully, controlling
naoko is getting harder
I can't leave her alone
for even a minute
The voices in her head are getting louder
She shut off from the world
and went deep inside herself"
Kidzuki?
Kidzuki?
Naoko!
You know, Kidzuki...
Unlike you, I chose life
And I'll try to live it decently
as much as I can
I can imagine, how hard it was for you
But you too, imagine, how it was for me
when you died, leaving Naoko
basically in my arms
And I decided to never leave her...
Because I love her.
But now I'll be even stronger
Because for me, unlike you
it's time to grow up
Let's go?
After we met in the bar
I talked to him
And we broke up
I love you a lot.
With all my heart
But I can't do anything
right now
- Because of her?
- Yes
Tell me... Did you sleep with her?
Just once. 
Last year.
And since then we haven't been seeing each other
We met two more times.
But there was nothing between us.
Why?
Does she not like you?
I can't talk about it
It's a difficult situation.
One thing, that I know, is this thing
it's responsibility for people
And you can't just brush it off
Even if, let's say
I didn't love her
Even if, it happens
she doesn't love you?
I need time.
Forgive me...
But this is all, that I'm asking right now
Okay.
I'll be waiting for you.
Because I trust you.
But when you come to me
pick only me, do you promise?
When you hug me -
hug only me, okay?
Do you know, what I mean?
I understand you good.
You can do what you want to me
never hurt me, okay?
I've collected too much pain
I just want happiness.
Hug me?
Naoko died.
Nothing can heal us
from losing a loved person.
Not truth, not sincerity,
not strength, not kindness
All that we can, is to live
while hugging this tragedy
And learn that, no other new 
loss will be any less painful
So, this is where
you were planning to live with Naoko?
Sorry, I have to take a shower.
I want for you to always remember me.
For you to never forget
that I was by your side
Promise
Promise.
I'll never forget you
What are you planning to do?
I'll go to Asahikava
My classmate
started a music school there
And you don't want to meet with
husband and daughter?
Listen, Vatanabe.
A?
What do you think
do people fall in love in Asahikava?
Of course, don't even doubt it.
You'll definitely meet a decent 
person there.
It's important that you fall in love.
I have a request for you
will you do it?
Yes, of course.
Sleep with me!
Are you serious?
Yes, I think, it needs to be like that.
I'll go take a shower.
Do you really want it?
Finally, I returned to myself
what I lost 7 years ago
Thank you.
You don't have to walk me to the station
I'll find my way
I want to.
Really, it's not worth it.
Let's separate here.
Asahikava is a good city
I'll visit you.
Be happy. For me and for naoko.
- Hello?
- Midori, it's me.
Midori...
I want to see you and talk to you.
I want to start everything
with you from the beginning
Except you, in life
there's nothing left to want
I love you...
Where are you?
What?
Where are you right now?
Where am I right now?
Every new time of year 
I'm farther from my corpses
Kidzuki is still 17
Naoko - 21...
And that's forever
