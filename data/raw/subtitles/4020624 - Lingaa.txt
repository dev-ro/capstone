Politics is our best bet

Haven't got any matter, sir
Don't you knowabout this gang?
They won't share their spoils
No one will come forwardto bail them out either
Sir, why don't youlet us out, just like that?
Phrase 'just like that' doesn'texist in my dictionary
But you simply get paidfor sitting just like that?
I'll pierce this baton fromyour mouth to your back
Oh! You're a magician too?Show me a demo
It's not magic
If I really pierce youyour life will be a tragedy
You can never get married
File a report against him

What do you want, dear?
Take out on bail, sir
Bail, huh?
Who, Mahalakshmi?

The whole place knowsyou are the 'super star'!
Don't try to fool me
Listen, dear
Nothing happens herewithout Lakshmi, dear
- Without me?- I didn't mean you

Like a girl who has hiddennotes to copy in an exam...
...she's picking up notesfrom all parts of her body
Rs 10,000
Okay, dear
Release Lingaa alone
Lingaa won't come aloneIt's either all or none
He's a true-
...friend!
If you want me torelease everyone...
...Goddess of wealthshould be more generous
Ugh!

'With cameraman DevarajLakshmi from Public TV'
On your knees
All of youkneel down
Shut up
What's with you?
I swear when I see you, it's likeGoddess Lakshmi is in front of me

I'll disregard my Tuesday sentimentand return the money to you, dear
Give me the money
Here, sir
All yours
Short by 6
Is that so?
Who flicked that?
I took it assumingit is my share, sir
Just by the twist of a wristhe flicked 6 notes
He seems morecriminal minded than us
You tore my dignity to tatters
Can I take them, sir?
Please do, dear
Come along with me
Ma...ma...madam
What now?
Footage you filmed
Hear it in Public
The public will only thrash me
'Public' TV!
You want me to openthe temple in Solaiyur?
Are you trying to be funny?
If it has been locked for 70 yearsthe doors are bound to be stuck
Take a few carpentersand get the door opened
Why call him?
Ho...joke, huh?
Good joke, laugh out loudIf it's weak, turn a deaf ear
For a whole week, do youknow how many people...
...have been huntingfor you all over the place?
That's the stamp of a celebrity!
How did you find out?
I anchor a reality show
Instead of palaces, I looked for himin the cities he was born and raised
I never thought such royal bloodwill be holed up amongst rogues
Do you know your grandfatherwas the most revered king ever?
How can youresort to thieving?
Yes, agreedI am a thief
I've also heardall the tales
My grandfather built a temple,dug a pond, served the people
What did he do for me?
What did he give my father?
Not even a tiledor thatched hut!
My father was a teachertill his last breath
Do you have any ideahow much my parents suffered?
When I think of itmy blood boils!
My grandpa lived life royally,had his fun and passed away
I'm living in my dream world
Do you know how many daysI've stood outside the palace?
I wasn't even allowed in
He drained his wealth to the last paisaand left behind only his name
I'd have deletedLingeswaran too
But since it isLord Shiva's name...!
So I shortened it to Lingaa
Eat, manDon't gape
You don't respectyour grandpa one bit
Come to my village, you'll thenrealize how people worship him
Money brings name,fame and the whole works
But when you're in trouble,no one will lend you a hand
Holds good from mythological Karnato film comedian N.S Krishnan
All you want is moneyIsn't that why you steal?
Tell me how muchI'll give you
You thought the word 'money' willmake him flash his 'close up' smile?
Money it seems!
Okay, how muchwill you give?
Don't be cheap
Listen girl, I'll get involvedin a job only if my heart says so
Only if I've shed my bloodand sweat, I'll accept money
But stealing isno sweat for a thief!
Dear, ear, eye, nose, mouth, limbs,heart and brain work as a combo...
...only when it comes to stealing
Any job you can doand sleep in peace
But this is the onlysleepless profession!
They won't understand
Zip-zoom!
I haven't finished eating
Stuff the restin your pocket
Lingaa...please
You didn't let usfinish our meal
We are all downto the last penny
But style we have in plenty!
Why?
For getting us out
Can I hug you?
Will you come just onceto my village, please?
He'll tell only onceYou should take the hint
Shouldn't bug him like someonepestering for an insurance policy!
Job over?Zip-zoom!
'How can I take him home?'
Oh gawd!My chain?
Give Rs 8000
Who should give?
Me give
Say 'I will give'
Teach this moneylenderto speak proper Tamil
As if he'll ever learn!Bargain and close the deal
8000 bucks won't evenlast for 4 days, Sait
If you flick chains frommodern girls, that's all
How do you knowshe's a modern girl?
Because they preferchains light as feather
We would love toflick chunky jewelry
But such decked up women don'tshow up even in a grocery store
Will your wife be coveredin jewels head to toe?
Oh! She loves wearing them
But all coveringImitation only
Why do you give hersuch cheap stuff?
As if you don'thave real gold?
I have a gold mine!
But too many thieves around
Not you, man
He meant himself
Here...all yours
Why stress him outfor no reason?
Lingaa, why team up with thesepetty thieves and settle for less?
How do I hit the jackpot?
They all wear fake gold
I must only target a bank
You can't do all that
Even high tech men get caught
Listen, for 3 daysin a 5 star hotel...
...Lalitha jewellery is holdingan exhibition and sale
Just 1 necklace flicked from therehe will give you 15 million bucks
Huh?!
I will give you
That's a whammy1 necklace is 15 million?
That's not just gold
Gold necklacestudded with emerald
Wait, Sait
He's twirling his gray cellsto see how to pull it off
Is emerald that expensive?
Of course
Besides, the necklaceis an antique piece
We don't fancy aunties
Lingaa, before teaching me Tamil...
...help these morons tospeak proper English
- Come this side- Yes, my lord
Tomorrow Lingaa coming withthat 15 million antique piece
It isn't a walkoverlike you think
Nothing in life comes easy
But with effortnothing is impossible

Don't know, sir
Totally confused
(voices overlapping)
Don't miss a single spot
Cupboard, toilet
Every bloody nook and corner
He'll yell at melouder than thunder
Why is this sound piercingmy ear drums repeatedly?
Don't know, sir
Why did we stitch uniformswith 15 meters of cloth...
...and send a battalion behind you?
Height of inefficiency!
This sound is driving me deaf
Maybe a short circuit problem
It seems long circuit to me!
All the customersare badgering me
Shouldn't give 5 star hotelsfor exhibitions like this!
Urgent, switch it off permanently
Heard him?Switch it off permanently
Must switch off the alarmpermanently it seems
Whiz-king!
All this drama for the alarmto be switched off permanently
Yes, if you let go of mewe can attend to the next job
Why has it suddenly hung?
Seems like magicI'm clueless
Fatso is denyingthe short circuit theory
We can see itin the CCTV clearly
It's got stuck
I asked you to checkthe monitor, did you?
I'm lookingfor the mouse, sir
You're just repeatingthe same dialog
What are you doing here?
You said the mouse was missing
- I found it, sir- Very good
- Soooper- Here you are
Quick...rewind and check
Check where the soundis blaring from
Is this a wedding cassetteto rewind many times?
Even more important
'Narrow escape frombeing nailed to the cross'

Why is everyone coming this-
Crowd is rushing in, sir
Please visit the templein my village just once
Send them that side
Stop everyone
Excuse meDon't rush
Keep an eye on the jewelry

Where did you hidethe necklace you stole?
Look at your neck
When did you fix it?
When we rushed out now
How do your partswork so smoothly?
- Sir...?- What, man?
Look here
Wretched hoodlums!
They literally prayed tothis heirloom in Hindu fashion
Sanctified itand stole it
This is daylight robbery!
Do you really thinkit's a fair price?
Selling price isonly 30 million
Whoever buys outsidewill only offer 20 million
Shouldn't I getat least 1/4 share?
Okay, fish out the cash

Greetings, sirWelcome
This village is showering uswith so much respect
Not for 'us'But for the lead
All the grandmothersof this village are here
Your grandpa must havebeen quite a player!

Just walk along with me
Wherever he walkshe's got style-
Hype it up some more!

Raja, I have a veryimportant appointment
- I'll take leave- Please...okay
Greetings, sir
I'm a poet
Our clan's custom is to singin praise of the king who'll reward us
I want to followthat custom today
What does he want?
It seems he has beggedby singing for generations!
To beg is to takewith permission
That isn't wrong
My ancestors have said'to steal is a crime'
How does he know about us?
That's what puzzles me
Please sing
If he singsyou must pay him
- Got money?- He won't ask!
'What will he bestow?What will he endow?'
'Wondering though'
'He'll shower goldLavish gifts untold'
'If 'not enough' I declareHe'll pile more on a platter'
'If even these don't sufficehis own self our king will sacrifice'
'Even he'll forsakehis life for our sake'
'Lord of compassion!'
Just throw himand squash him flat
Poet!
Old man!!
Kothandam, I left my gold braceletin the car, please bring it for me
Shall I sing anothersong in praise of you?
Kots...come here
He wants to singanother song it seems

'When enmity eruptsa support will show up'
'After the dark nightdawns sunlight'
'There is a bright futurefor each and every creature'
Boring bee! Everyonehas a future, do you?
Yes, I can see itright before my eyes
Kothandam, I've kept a Rado watchalong with my bracelet, bring that too

Then all that you wanted to give?
- Poet...?- That's me...me
When you sangin praise of me...
...how happy I was
You should be
When I said I'd give youbracelet, watch, money...

Of course!
Then we are quits!
I never expected this from you
You'll borrow songs written by laureatesKannadasan, Vaali and Vairamuthu
And I should pay you, huh?
Get lost
Sir...!
Grandpa, you need nothave any doubts
He's our king's grandson
I have all the proof needed, fromhis birth certificate to DNA test
I don't needany of those, dear
His face is proof enough
He is from that king's lineage
The same laughterWelcome, my son
You should open the templethe next Full moon night
Shall I go aheadwith the preparations?
No rush, grandpa
We were planning torest here for a while
You can stay herefor many years
This is your place
This place is ours?How many acres?
Thanks a lot
Son, I need to talkto you in private
Shall we go in?
No need alone
Whatever it iswe can discuss here
It's very important
He's calling you in, right?
He might show yousome bureau
Check if we can line our pocket!
Signal from inside
Owning such a big bungalow,why do you work in a TV channel?
If you rent it for a TV soapyour bank balance will overflow
What can I doin this village?
At least in the city I cancheck out a few handsome hulks
Whaaat...?You go out on dates?
Why do you pouncelike a monkey for that?
So many girls end upin a drunken stupor
After all she's only dating!
This village is under the impressionthe 'linga' in the temple is ordinary
Let me share with you somethingeven my granddaughter doesn't know
It is made of emerald
Made with the mostprecious stone
After this temple is opened,with tight security...
...you should be the one toannounce this fact to our folks
Okay
This is a big matter, sir
Here, sir
Thanks a ton
You've saved mefrom a huge crisis
This is life and death for youThat is even bigger for me
Look over there
Next week, celebrating'Cancer awareness'...
...I'll ensure these hugeballoons float in the sky
When people are busylooking up in awe...
...we'll finish our job below
- Got it?- Understood, sir
It will definitelybe done, sir
'Linga' studded with emeralds, huh?
Yeah...!
If an emerald necklaceis worth 15 million...
...won't an emerald lingafetch about 15C?
15C and 21C are all busesparked in Mandaiveli terminus!
Cheapo!
Stop thinking at cow dung level
Junk piece!
It will be worthmore than 300 millions
"Cash, dough, dollar, rupee, money"
But we have to waitfor the Full moon night
You'll wait patiently till 10 p.mfor the wine shop to open
Can't you wait for this?
We can lift it only afterthe temple is opened
We'll do it todayWe'll do it right now
And then we canscoot from this place
Correct
Ideas and chips are same
If you delaythey lose the crunch!
Zip-zoom now
Hello!
Your latest planis to steal what?
Linga-
Don't blabber, she didn'teavesdrop properly!
We're telling Lingaa aboutyour height, weight and bright-
And the sunrises in the west!
- She isn't believing me- Then say it so she'll buy it
We were discussing who the chap isback in the city you intend hitting on!
As if he doesn't know
Tell and then touch
No time to announceIt's a spontaneous gesture
Heard that?
Even the stiff onebites the dust!
You angle to tangleI'm off to bed
I'm also not sleepy
Let's just strollaround the village
Why choose this time of night?
That's the fashion now
Day is too much disturbance
Yeah, it's likeA.R.Rahman style
But remember not to gonear the dam or temple
Why...why is that?
I believe ghostsfrequent that place
'Smash you with a slipper'
'Bash you witha broomstick'
My father used to sayghosts will fly hearing this
Yeah!Zip-zoom?
Landing in this remote corner...
...building a templewith an emerald 'linga'
...if your grandpa had chosen Madrasour job would've been eas-
Don't yell
Lord Shiva, guide us to-
Why do you carry this yellow baglike a gypsy who tells the future?
It's a retribution bag
If I carry it,no ghost can come near us
Liar! You're with us all the time
Your route is truly unique
All-ways!
Check if the wood is strong
Are you intending tomake it into door jambs?
Get in soonClimb up fast
Stop harpinglike a bus conductor
Who is that jumping intothe temple compound?
Come fast
Wait, my yellow baghas got caught
Come
It is so ancient
What if someone elsehas stolen it before us?
Why do you invitebad omen?
We've taken the trouble ofscaling this wall, we'll get it
- Get a stone- Here
Hit...hit
Hit harder
Are you breaking a betel nut?
It's a lock, give itone strong blow
Success!
Move aside
Did God know we were coming andlatched the door on the inside?
Let's push barefeetwith sanctity!
Well done
Is spider man living here?
So many cobwebs?
This temple doesn't look likeit has been shut for 70 years
More like 700 years
Lingaa, this doesn't looklike an emerald 'linga'
Then Abraham Lincoln or what?
Bring water from that well
You call the officersI'll go and call the villagers
Before you bring themthey'll escape
What to do now?
Snake!Do something
How did you pull this miracle?
Just one glare and you madethe snake disappear
Are you such a brave man?
Enough of pressing your footon the sewing machine pedal
No other go
I can hear the alarm
Come...come quick
Snake has slithered away
Come...come
Watch out
Your headBend down
Who sounded the siren?
See if we can escape that way
Look thereYou look this side
Did you seeface to face?
We both saw
Circle the temple
Go all around
Like crows diving for dried fish,they are zeroing in on us
No way out
We are dead meatThey will skin us alive
Are we boiled eggsto be peeled?
- Arrogant ass!- Don't bite me
Bro is grindinghis gray cells
He'll come up with something
Wait and watch
Move asideGive way
Greetings, sir
Who saw?
We did, sir
Do you know who jumped?
Our king's heir who has comefrom out of town and his 2 stooges
You nincompoop!He's of royal lineage
He's the grandson ofthe one who built this temple
Why do you get angry?
If we open the doorwe'll know the truth
Let's do that
If you give us permissionwe can open the temple door
If the heir whom I thoughtshould open this door...
...is now a suspect,what's the point in waiting?
Open the door
Let the entire village lend a hand
Come, let's open
Push...push
Push harder
Push some more
'From His thick forest-like hair agleamand matted, flows a clear stream'
'In His consecrated neck hangingis a splendid garland of serpent hissing'
'Damad damad damad damadTo this sound of the drum'
He danced His divine TandavaMay He shower prosperity, Lord Shiva!
'From His thick forest-like hair agleamand matted, flows a clear stream'
'In His consecrated neck hangingis a splendid garland of serpent hissing'
'Damad damad damad damadTo this sound of the drum'
'He danced His divine TandavaMay He shower happiness, Lord Shiva!'
'In the pan of His matted hair agleam'
Praise be to Lord Shivathe destoryer of all evil
'In the well of his hair-locksCelestial Ganges st(r)eams across'
'Dhagad dhagad dhagad flameson His forehead's surface'
'With crescent moonas jewel on His head'
'May I find joy alwaysin His constant Grace'
You gave me such a huge honor
I won't forget it in this birthand all my births to come
This village has been blessedeven more than you, son
Someone saidhe committed a misdeed
We were the oneswho made the mistake
We planned a Full moon nightto open Lord Shiva's temple
That was our biggest mistake
What's today?
'Holy night of Lord Shiva'
That's the day the Lordmarried his consort Shakthi
That's why we weremade to open it tonight
Even if what you say is true...
...why jump over the wallto open the door?
If they had told uswe'd have done this...
...in a grand, religious manner
He did so because the templeclosed by the entire village...
...should be openedin the same way
You may be unaware
Or some might have diedwith this secret to their grave
But he knows his grandfatherKing Lingeswara only too well
Just like him, one daythe king too came here
He came to our villagefrom some unknown place
Everyone is part ofa looting gang, huh?
No, we are freedom fighters
A brave man is onewho attacks his enemy
Not one who loots
Freedom is when onestruggles for his country
Not for your house
We are also patriotsfighting for our country
Then why did you jump on toa running train at midnight?
To kidnap you
Who?
We came to kidnapa British Collector
But I never expected himto be an Indian
Only the unexpectedis always interesting
What do you gain bykidnapping the Collector?
I'll hold him as hostage and freeour imprisoned freedom fighters
If you get them freed...?
We'll release the Collector
If they are arrested again?
Will you kidnapanother Collector?
Fool! If you're truly patrioticinstead of being so stupid...
...join the real freedom fightersand support their cause
If you want the non violent'ahimsa' way, follow Gandhi
If you want to take up armsjoin Subash Chandra Bose's force
Use your brain
Don't wear a hoodand fool yourselves
Go on...move it
Greetings, sir
I'm the Sub Collectorof this district
Lingeswaran
- How do you do?- Fine, sir
Johnson?
Leave themLet them go
No, sir
You rememberall that I told you
Careful
Don't get beaten up again
How far is Solaiyur?
6 miles, sir
Stop the train
Stop the train please
This has becomea daily ritual here
Move aside, man
Blocking our way
Wonder what troublethey will cause now!
Yov! Bone marrow!
Why didn't you stop?
What, man?
You're also huffing andpuffing just like your train?
Why did you come early today?
Aiyo! This is the right time
Oh! So you comelate daily, huh?
Don't mess it up
You'll make me lose my job
Yov! Start the train, man
You'll move from here, huh?
Try leaving withoutgiving us water!
My dear girl!
I can't give waterCollector is watching me
So what? Why shouldwe be bothered?
Each of us willgive you 2 tapiocas
Just give us on the slyand 'chug-chug' away
I have a familyto take care of
My job is at stake
Listen to me
- Collector sir- Gawd! He has seen me
Ask him to give us water
Okaaaay, sir
You'll break your insides,bone marrow!
This is for you,Bag-o-bones
My boss is watching
Collector sir'Tanks' a lot
No mention
Want a tapioca?
Thank you
Naughty girl!
Oh my Lord Easwara!
Greetings, sir
I'm the village chief of Solaiyur
This is Sammandham,once a wealthy man
He's Kavi BharathiBig shot in this village
He is-
A very good afternoonto everybody
Come to the point
We have handed over countlesspetitions expressing our troubles
We even sent telegrams
But it has all been in vain
If we submit100 petitions...
...Collector will comeHe'll meet all of us
And promise to lookinto it later and disappear
They were all BritishAnd they didn't lift a finger
You seem to be one of us
We are sure this timewe will be lucky
As a Collectorwhatever I can...
...I'll do my best
Tell me what your problem is
Water is our problem
See the river over there
Look how dry it is
This is how it is9 months in a year
We have to walk 6 to 8 milesdaily to fetch drinking water
Otherwise, know the rail engine?
Half the crowd will rush toget hot water from the engine
Suddenly rains from somewherewill cause a deluge in the river
The flood will washour village away
The boy standing therelost his father in the flood
This young girllost her husband
The flood will even wash awaythe goats we rear for our livelihood
In this drought seasonwe won't have water
Fields will be dryNo rainfall
But hunger alone is hereto stay in our village
In a nutshell,we are at a loss...
...whether this river iswith water or without
My God! An entire familyhas fallen into a huge pit
That isn't a pitIt's an old well
Poor souls!
Often our folks are forcedto commit suicide
Bharathi! Imagine their anguishto end their lives like this
God knows how many morewill die in this famine?
In a state of total despairunable to survive without food...
...they preferredto end their lives
This is the plightof our village
This kind of farmer's suicideisn't a rare incident
It is a daily occurence
Rather than live in miseryif we ask them to find work outside...
...they refuse sayingthey were born here
To die in hunger like thiswhat does it matter which soil?
Our pleas fall only on deaf ears
Wonder who will take totalresponsibility for this death toll
We don't know who will comeand prevent all this, sir
Hereafter, not even 1 life will belost due to famine in this village
I won't let it happen
Hasn't he eaten?
Not yet
Sir, why haven't youhad your dinner?
If I skip 1 meal in a dayit isn't the end of the world
Only if one is unable toeat even once a day...!
'If an individual is denied foodwe'll destroy this world, we would'
We have to build a damfor the people of Solaiyur
Yes, it is a dam
I want to build forthe people of Solaiyur
Damn it!
Mr Lingeswaran, you got no ideathe cost of constructing a dam
Not one of the Collectorspresent here is aware
Even I don't know
But you definitely do!
Why?
Because, you haven't passedjust the Indian Civil Service
But an efficient engineer who hasstudied Civil engineering in Cambridge
Yes, sir, I know as a civil engineerwhat the total expenditure will be
So how will we getsuch a huge amount?
Why can't you build itwith the taxes collected in India?
How does the British Govtbenefit by doing so?
If we block the waters whichwould otherwise reach the sea...
...and build a dam, how fertilethe surrounding land will become
Don't you know thatas a Collector?
And are you unaware ofthe increased income you'll get?
And how much tax tolevy on the farmer...
...should an Indian teachthe British Govt, huh?
We are fully aware
No necessity for youto teach our Government
Mr Lingeswaran, first approvemy plan that you objected
You see, if you laid a train trackfrom Madurai to Cochin...
...Govt.can see returns
Won't that cost money?
It will, but-
In spite of it, at onceyou'll gain multifold, right?
That's why you builtall these railroads in India
From gold, diamond, emerald, ruby,coral, pearl, lapis lazuli to pepper...
...countless products you planned tosmuggle from here to your country
So you laid these tracks
Or else to enjoy withyour family in hill stations
I am sorry
As Madurai CollectorI can't approve this
Yes, we won't sanctionthe approval either
You're also workingfor the British Govt
So don't plan on whatto give the people here
Think of what you cantake to Buckingham!
In fact you should think of whatyou'll take when you finally go up
You are lettingyour tongue run!
Yes, wishing to do some good formy motherland, I'm talking too much
You have to getyour salary from us
Don't forget that
I work as a Collectorfor the British Govt
Not for your salary
I want to serve the people
For the joy it gives meAnd for my satisfaction
What if we dismiss youfrom your post as Collector?
What's the use of beinguseless to everyone?
Why should you dismiss me?
I'll myself resign
By resigningyour Collector's job...
...you've already failed
I haven't failed
I've just postponedmy success!
I know where and how to getpermission to build the dam
See you soon
No use trusting this Govt
Even the newly appointed Collectorhas resigned his job it seems
Only God cansave us hereafter
My...fabulous!What a palace!!
Do you want one like this?
What a joke?
Hey Janet, never everunderestimate me
Oh! Bless you
- Madam?- Not for me, thank you
That is fantastic
It's Italian, sir
Collector, sir, he isthe landlord of Rayakottai
Nice to meet you
Evening
Governor is on the way
Be alert
Your Excellency!Maharaja is coming
Hey! He's Collectorof Madurai, right?
Not anymore
He was the Collector of Madurai
But always a king!
Ladies and gentlemenand my dear friends
As you all know, His Highnessthe Maharaja of Kodiyur...
Raja Lingeswaran has so graciouslyinvited us here tonight for dinner and...
...celebration of his birthday
And to him I wisha very long life
Everything is madeof silver and gold
He really is a very rich man
Yes, I've justcome to know
Well! I have been heremore than 10 years
I know TamilJust a few words
But I understand it very well
Was this your father's placebefore it was yours?
So you are followingin your father's footsteps?
Actually my ambition wasto become an engineer
So my dad sent meto study in London
But his last wish wasfor me to study ICS
And become a Collector
Why ICS?
My father used totell me quite often
Our ancestors had a lot of powerwhen they were kings
They could do what they wantedfor the people without constraints
But in your British ruleonly Collectors have the power
So he wanted me to becomea Collector and I studied ICS
Then why did you resign?
I couldn't do what I wanted
Go on, what did youwant to do? Tell me
I think this isn't the rightplace and time to discuss
It's always the right place and timeto discuss things between friends, right?
With my resources I want todo a lot of good for my people
Who is going to object?
This isn't about objection
I want your permission
What do you wantmy permission for?
I intend building a damfor the people of Solaiyur
You are going to buildthis dam on your own
I have enough resourcesto spend on my own and build
Permission granted
Thank you very much
I'm really honouredon my birthday
God bless you, my friend
Thanks a lot
Congratulations
Excuse me, sir
What is it, Lawrence?
If an individual builds a damin our British Govt...
...that's an insult to us, sir
Do you actually think he canbuild a dam by himself?
Impossible, sir
Then why botherarguing about it?
Right now, all these rajasare watching us closely
Already we are facing problemswith Gandhi in the north
Why create a new one here?
We also needIndia's support...
...in the 2nd world warwhich has just begun
We need the support ofeach and every king on this table
We can't oppose any of them
You understand he'll neverbuild that dam, don't you?
Absolutely not
Your Highness, my man here,Collector Lawrence, tomorrow morning...
...will bring to youthe orderyou desire
That's what we were discussing
We didn't consent, so you usedyour birthday dinner as an excuse...
...and in a devious, cunning mannergot the Governor to agree, right?
Didn't you comeinto India as traders...
...with East India companyas a smoke screen
...and deviously deceivedthe kings here to loot our country?
Was what I did worse than that,Mr Lawrence Hunter?
Anyway permission aloneisn't enough, Mr Lingeswaran
Without our support let me seehow an Indian can build a dam?
Haven't you seenthe Grand Anaicut in Trichy?
King Karikala Cholabuilt it 2000 years ago
Look at Kodiveri damin Coimbatore
It is strong even today
That was whenthey ruled as kings
All that a king needsis the support of his subjects
Always by God's grace I havemy people's support in all ways
I don't care who supports youYou can't build that dam alone
It's a challenge
To achieve a goalsupporters will be in plenty
But one man as enemy will bethe reason to make it happen
You'll be that reasonto finish building this dam
It will never happen
Wait and see
Is he coming?
No, he isn't
Coming?
Not yet!
Hey, give it to meYou're not lucky at all
I'll take a lookGive it to me
How long I've beenasking for your earrings
Give that to me first
Why are you alwayseyeing my earrings?
My father wears studs
But he refusesto buy me a pair
Okay, when my fathergets me another pair...
...I'll give thisto you, okay?
- Promise?- I swear
That's half a promiseYou didn't pinch!
- Is he coming?- Yes, coming
- Coming...what's coming?- Some 'pleasure' is coming
'Pleasure'?
Horse carriagethat the British use
Oh! See who's in it
Remember the Collectorwe saw in the station
He's coming
Why is the Collector coming?
- Hey, Collector is coming- Oh my God, Collector is coming!
Stop...!
Stop the car
Boss, some girl is runningin the middle of the road
- Stop...stop- Yes, I see her
Please stop
Stop...!
Bharathi, stone
Oh gawd!
Looks like someoneset this nail deliberately
Move a little bit
Look out...water!
I showeredin the morning!
Bharathi, I'm talkingabout being flooded
And you are simplywalking away like that?
I heard some noise
Let me go and check
Our boys would've usedexplosives to dig a well
Why waste time?
You cleaned the car that wascovered in dust in seconds?!
Drenched completely
Hmmm...who was it meant for?
- Math teacher- For what?
Because they didn'tdo the sums properly...
...look how he has hit them
Hey, show him
Seems quite a hard blowBruises are a ripe purple!
- Why didn't you show?- Why don't you...?
- Chee...!- Likewise
You saw the bruises
That's why
We did this to teacha lesson to the teacher
- So...whose idea was it?- Bharathi
You got the brainof an engineer!
Lord Easwara!
Hey! How can you callour boss by his name?
Good lord!
Didn't I tell you the Collectoris a good man and won't get angry?
Who told you...?
Of course you'll be punished!
Sir, hold tight
You seem to be a pro
What's that village?
Palaiyur
Rain water has startedflowing into the river
I don't know whenthis place will get flooded
I thin-
Do as I told you
When you do things on the sly,you do it happily, right?
You intend building a dam?
That would cost a king's ransom!
How much arethey spending?
Permission is theirsExpenditure is mine
Cooperation is your contribution!
You'll be doingour people a huge favor
Why won't they cooperate?We'll take care of that!
Thank you very much
By the way, how will youcollect that huge an amount?
I'm the only son ofking Parameswara of Kodaiyur
Lord Easwara!
Does that meanyou are a king?
I haven't come here as a king
But as an engineerto build this dam
You are a king not onlybecause of your wealth
Even your heartis made of gold
Finally good time hasdawned on our village
You've got the king himselfin the palm of your hand
You're something else!
Sir, because of the rainthe whole place is flooded
Won't it be difficultto build the dam now?
We must divert the riverand then start work
Won't it be too laborious?
If you want your wish fulfilledyou got to sweat it out

What's this, Sami Pillai?
Her people are hell benton ruling our country
I thought I could overruleat least one and show her hell!
So I married her
What did that girl say?
Get back to work!
Not 1 or 2...I've spokenwith all our village folks
Not even in his dreamscan he construct this dam
You might think I'm lying
By this time our people would havechased that king out of this place
What if they change their mind?
No, they won't
I've set up our menin every village around here
That's why our budgetexceeded a little bit
Bring me the good newsthat the king has left this place
I'll even bequest an entirevillage in your name
It's all in cash-
Subburaju, why is everyonesmiling from ear to ear?
You've chased the kingout of this place, right?
Come and look for yourself
Rangan
Murugan...go
Palanisamy...go
Maintain the queue
Ramasamy
Muthaiya
Ganesan...?
Kuppusamy...?
What happened?
We came just like you saidto chase him away from here
True, if we builda dam here...
...not 30 but 36 villagesto the east will submerge
That's what I've beensurveying all these days
Not to worry, 8000 acres of landin the west belongs to this man
Landlord of RayakottaiMy childhood friend
He has offered youthis huge extent of land
I thank him forhis good heart!
I'm not good hearted
He is golden hearted!
I'm not givingthis land free of cost
He has already paid me!
Whoever has land in the east,he has asked me to transfer...
...the same extent of landin the west in all their names!
If we construct a dam in the east,then in your land in the west...
...you can harvestfor 3 seasons in a year!
Thank you very much
Thank you so much
But on 1 condition!
You must transfer in my nameyour eastern land that will be flooded
Only when I ownall that land...
...can I build the damwithout any hassle!
You don't have todonate it free of cost
I'll pay you twicetoday's value
Are you willing?
You're giving us sugar caneand paying us to eat it!
Will anyone refuse?Of course we are willing
Aren't you okay with this?
- We accept- We agree
Hey! Stop it
All that can't be done
That land belongsto my grandfather
How can I transfer it to you?
All that can't be done
Tell him you can't
Listen, he's givinghis land to replace ours
And also offering to pay ustwice the value of our land
Why?
For our village to prosper
That's going over your head!
This is my ancestral property
I refuse outright
Is the welfare ofthis village important?
Or your dead grandfather?
You're keeping quiet whilehe's letting his tongue run
You better accept it
Otherwise the whole village will uniteand destroy your entire lineage
- What, man?- Of course
Say 'yes'
Or else we'll packall of you to hell
Lord Easwara...!
If we had protested further...
...our own folkswould've burnt us alive!
That's why we alsoaccepted their money
He beat us with his money
You can beat mewith your slipper!
What's the pointin beating you?
Dammit!
True! All dam's fault!
But he can't be stopped
The dam will bebuilt for sure
Lord Easwara...!
83, 84
Look at thisIt's pathetic!

Break it real hard
How can you askstudents to help?
Stop this
Get up

This was on his birthday
Boss...sir...?
- Hey! Who is this?- Aiyo! No 'mansion'
Subbu, ask themwhat they want
At once, sir
Eat well
What do you want?
Shall I serve you some gravy?
That's whyI warned you!
I told you, before startinga project of this magnitude...
...it's our practiceto sacrifice a goat
Do we sacrifice for famineand also to eradicate famine?
Well said!
Shouldn't there bea limit for superstition?
It's safer to sacrifice
If you kill 100 goats,villagers will be happy!
Even if we kill you,the whole village will rejoice!
Shut your gob
Listen, if we build this damwithout any mishap...
...I'll build a templefor this village
- There won't be any hitch- Glad to hear this, sir
Why are you back?Go and take rest!
It's just a small woundI'll get back to work

Planning to getyour daughter married?
She's still youngWhat's the rush?
- But she's in a rush!- What are you saying?
Look over there
- Get lost- Don't play the fool
They are just kidsplaying with each other
And you're makinga mountain out of a mole-
If you get them both married,you won't have any hassles later
How can you even say this?
You know very well that boyis from a caste lower than ours
Oh big deal!
How can caste bea criteria these days?
Look there
From barbarians to gypsies...
...castes, high and low
They are eating togetherwithout any discrimination
Can you differentiateby caste, creed or religion?
In those days even wells weresegregated according to castes
Aren't we building the damover there without hierarchy?
Tomorrow when we getwater from that source...
...people from all casteswill go and fetch water
We will all work togetherfor our daily existence?
How come caste comes into playonly when you start a family?
Hey Vasantha!
- Get up from there- Father?
You brainless nitwit!
You are eating along witha boy from a lower caste
Are you all bird brained?
Sit according toyour caste and eat
If you still want to eat,ask our caste to eat first
Then serve food toother lesser mortals
Hey! You think we arebeggars to eat leftovers?
You stupid numskull!
Your skull is the thickest
Hey! Shut up
- People, get up- He's demeaning us
If they have an ounceof pride, let them go
If I send a couple of men like youbehind Gandhi, we'll rule India...
...hassle freefor another century
Not 100 years, sirbut 1000 years-
Aiyo! Madam is coming!
What the hell is thisscoundrel always doing here?
Not 'Gounder', my ladyI belong to another caste!
Sir, how come there isn'ta single soul here?
Where have they gone?
Things are strewn all around
Bring it
Listen to me carefully
This is your life
This is the progressfor your children
This is your future,livelihood, labor, food...
...clothing, shelter,happiness, everything
Now, this very moment,to build this temple and dam...
...will you lend me your hand?
Or do you want to dieof hunger and starvation?
And turn this villageinto a graveyard?
Decide for yourself!
One more announcement
I don't want any Mudaliyar tocome forward to build this dam
Nor do I want Naidus
Chettiars, Gounders, Iyers,lower caste, higher caste
Hindus, Christians, Muslims
Not a single soul
Beyond the barrierof caste and religion...
...if one of youin this gathering
...if he or she is an Indian
...and if the Indian bloodis running in your veins
...I want only that Indianto come forward
I don't want anyone else
Sami Pillai, pull upa chair for me

Sir, chair?
I knew you'd comein search of me
Mr LingeswaranKing of Kodaiyur
Only now you're standingin the place fit for you
Our ancestors didn't put youin your rightful place
That's why I'm standingMr Collector!
What's the matter?
First, rain has floodedthe western Ghats
And before the floods target us,we need dam's shutter equipments
Otherwise are you worried, your damwill be washed away in the flood?
No, I'm worried this whole villagewill be washed away in the flood
How can I prevent that?
As District Collector, you haveconfiscated all the equipments
Why should I?
Ego
You suffer from a complexyou may lose this challenge
I have nothing of that sort
Then grant mepermission at once
Okay
What's your 2nd problem?
Not minePeople's problem
I transferred land from the landlordof Rayakottai to the people of this village
Your Govt has confiscated it
As per our Govt's orders, landlordscan own only a certain amount of assets
It isn't the landlord's propertyIt belongs to the people now
But our Govt already bought it
Thanks to your conspiracy
You predated the documentby 2 years and cheated my friend
You found out, huh?
The whole countryknows you inside out
So what?
What do you want me to do?
Simple
As a Collector, pass an order statingthe farmer owns the land he cultivates
Can do, but nowit is Govt. property
We can't lift our fingerwithout any proof
I know only too well
State your rate
Do you want twice or 5 timesthe present land value?
I want 100 timesthe present value
My God!
Thanks to the dam it is nowfertile and equal to gold
That will be its value tomorrow

This is atrocious!
Let's meet the GovernorGo to the High court
Or if need be, even toLondon High court!
We are runningout of time now
This is not the workof a mere individual
It's a joint conspiracy!
Okay, I'll pay
I'll pay your price
I need 4 days grace time
Why 4 days?
I don't have ready cashOnly immovable assets
To make final settlementfor the sluice gate...
...I have to sell gold andsilver from my palace
To pay your exorbitant rateI'm forced to sell the palace
I need time tofinalize the deal
Why sell it tosome random stranger?
I'll give you moneyto pay for the sluice
Give me the palace
With all the gold, silver,furniture and fittings
Done
Tomorrow I'll comewith my palace documents
Wait...!
Janet, can youplease take her inside?
If you want our dealto be implemented...
...2 conditions
You shouldn't tell anyonewhat transpired between us
Ettappan like Brutuswill hide behind you
2nd condition?
Accept the dam was not builtby you but by the British Govt
I'm prepared to go to any lengthfor the dam and my people, okay?
Will you keep up your word?
See you tomorrow
Very good, sir
I've prepared an order...
...stating the Rayakottai landbelongs to the farmer
Hand it over safelyat the Collector's office
Yes, sir
Come...comeCome fast
Look, he bought these landsfor peanuts from us
That's the land document
He's selling our landsto the British!
Holy cow! Look at thosepiles of currency notes
He's taken many moresuch boxes before
How do you know?
One of the cops here ismy nephew...he saw them
Why is the dog barking?
Security, checkif anyone is there!
Let's scoot
All the silveris in the car
How can you still smile?
You built a dam for the peopleYou lost your name and wealth
You lost yourtitle and palace
But I haven't lostmy peace of mind
How long will you livehoarding all this?
For what I did today...
...many generations will benefitin years to come, you moron!
Come, Sami Pillai
Why is this 'linga'green in color, sir?
It's made of emerald
Really costly
We'll tell your fatherto appoint tight security
Okay
We'll inform the village later!
Yes
- Hey Dubash!- What, ma?
Where are your wife and children?
Gone to her parents' house
Why?
For the next delivery
Where are all our people?
No idea
Everyone is aware we are openingthe temple on Lord Shiva's Holy night
Your majesty, pleasecall a chaste virgin
With goodness of heartlet her light the lamp
The whole villagewill be prosperous!
Bharathi, light the lamp
He'll soon want you tolight his heart and home too!
You took the callbefore me, huh?!
Go, dear
Leader...chief!
Why are youdragging him?
Chief...please listen to me
Go away
Better clear out of this village
Hereafter, you don't havethe right to step into this village
What are you saying?
You don't know
You didn't see
But we all did!
We saw him accept a box filled withloads of cash from the British Collector
Who...he did...?
Did he take moneyfrom our enemy?
Yes...see if he canrefute my allegation!
Your majesty, did you takemoney from that British Collector
Yes
Now do you believe me?He himself has accepted
Ask him why he did so?
How can he answer that?
How can he revealwhat happened there?
Blue blood it seems!
It's an insult to him
Hey! Why shouldhe be humiliated?
Sami Pillai!
As if we won't knowif he doesn't tell us!
He told usif the dam is built...
...then all lands to the eastwill be submerged
So he bought themfrom us for pittance
Then he sold it to the Britishfor a king's ransom!
And went to and fro collectingbox-load of money from the Collector
Isn't it the truth?Tell them
We saw him hand overour documents to the British Collector
Yes
Why did he giveour documents to him?
Land that may submerge in watershould only be with the builder
What are you saying?
Ask him that question
If the dam was built bythe British Govt or by him?
Sir, was this dam built bythe British like they are saying?
Yes, this dam was builtby the British Govt
Then all these days why did youact like you built this dam?
Forget that
He gave us the land ownedby the landlord of Rayakottai...
...which he bought to replace ours
Isn't that also a drama?
Show him the notice
Did you takea good look?
He has sent us a noticeasking us to return those lands!
British took those lands fromthe landlord of Rayakottai long ago
Read it
What's your answer?
We've lost our lands
What do we do now?
I know what to do
I will take him apar-
Stop there
Don't even dream of steppinginto this village again
Go away
Correct, how canhe tackle the British?
Let's all fall at the feet ofthe Collector and request him
He'll return all our landsI can guarantee you that!
Why should a kingstoop down to do all this?
Business, naturally
He has done the same wheelingand dealing all rich people do
He isn't guiltythe way you all think
I'm talking frommy experience!
Look at his face
Does his face look likehe'll harm anybody?
Old lady, you'll vouchfor him and leave this world
We have to live with it
Go...go and buildsome more palaces
What are you looking at?
Listen! It's hard to build
But easy to demolish!
After all this,if you still wait here...
...we'll ourselves destroy the damwe built with our sweat and toil
Want to see that happen?
HE will take careof everything
Thank you very much
He betrayed us and builta temple like he's a saint!
Let's first shutthe temple doors
Come on
"Truth will triumph one day whenthis world will glorify you then"
"Only you, this village will acclaimYou...you sure deserve that fame"

Stoppppp!
Please stop
Hey! That's our girlStop the train
Bharathi, what are you doing here?
Where are you going?Get off the train
How can you leavethe place you were born-
Train is moving
Will you get down or not?
Tell me to dieand I'll gladly do so
But I won't goback to that village
The people theredon't have a heart
But I lit the lamp withgood faith in my heart-
Who denied that, my dear?
If you don't like me...
...drop me in some othervillage, but not Solaiyur
Had it been like before...
...only the houses along the banksof the river would've got swept away
Wonder what will happen now!
What will happen?
Dam will break and the wholevillage will get washed away!
Kill-joy! Why are youalways negative?
If I'm positive,dam won't break, huh?
You foul-mouthed fellow...!
Hey! Our king studiedengineering abroad
He'd have built it real strong
If you believed thatwhy didn't you stay behind?
Why are you strugglingalong with us?
Shut up, man
Nothing has happenedto the dam, it is safe
Good time has finallydawned on our village
That golden-hearted kingwill only think of our welfare
I told you peopleDid you listen?
Brainless blockheads!
Hurray!
Good time has begun
Solaiyur can at lastenjoy a golden period
Greetings, sir
What's news?
The newly built damsurvived the storm and flood
It has passed the test
The king is a shrewd businessmanBut he's an engineer who knows his job-
All that's irrelevant
Sir, only you should maintainthe dam your British Govt has built
You should open the sluicefor our fields to be irrigated
To enable our farmersto cultivate their crops...
...please provide waterby opening the sluice
Your Govt should return the landbelonging to the landlord of Rayakottai...
...to us farmers, so thatwe can cultivate the lands, sir
You can levy whatever tax you wantJust give our lands back to us
- Yes, sir- Please, sir
If I should do what you wantthen embed a culvert on that dam
'This dam was builtby the British Govt'
...should be the wordsinscribed on it
Invite me formallyto cut the ribbon
Only then I'll allow it
Nonsense!
How can you take creditfor something you didn't do?
Are you not ashamed?
Go inside at once
Why should I?
Whatever you wanted to grabfrom that king, you did
Isn't that enough?
Like a coward you nowwant to usurp his name also
Would you changeyour father's name also?
Shut upYou cunning dastard!
All of you are stupid
You have no hang upslicking anyone's feet?
Who built that dam?
You don't know
But I do
'I want 100 timesthe present value'
'Okay, I'll pay'
'I'll give you moneyto pay for the sluice'
'You shouldn't tell anyonewhat transpired between us'
'For what I did today...'
'...many generations will benefitin years to come, you moron!'
'Come, Sami Pillai'
Hey! What are you doing, idiot?
Look! Your king soldhis palace to this man...
...to get the order foryou to be the legal owners
See my husband's-
Sorry
The Collector's signature on it
That man, that rajah is your God
Don't you ever come lookingfor this devil here again
Get out of here
Madam, even amongst the Britishthere are a few good souls!
You proved it today
We are deeplyindebted to you
Where are you going?
I'm ashamed to livewith you anymore
I want to leave you
I can't copewith this anymore
You are an embarrassment
Listen! But there isnothing wrong on my part
I just behaveaccording to the Govt
It's known to the world...
...our Govt has been lootingthis country for generations
But there is real justiceAnd even bravery in it
You are nothingbut a coward
And I will not livewith a coward anymore
But I did all this for you
For what?
For me?
You wanted to bury mein that palace
Janet!Please, Janet
Let go of me
I can't livewithout you
I can't livewithout our child
Please, Janet
Then do one thing
'Built from 1939-1944by King Lingeswaran'
I am sorry forwhat I have done
This dam was built byKing Lingeswaran only
Not the British
Thank you
Traitor
We won't spare your life
Stop! Trying to escape?
King LingeswaraForgive me
Why are youso deep in thought?
By mistake we closedthe temple he built
We will forgive onhis feet for that
Bharathi, we should throwourselves at his feet
And make only him openthis temple once again
We don't knowhis whereabouts
He sold this palace
When he left he gaveall of us land for our upkeep
Thanks to his generositywe live without any wants
The last we saw of him was whenhe took the 'linga' from this temple
He told us, 'Solaiyur is my villageand my relatives still live there'
'I plan on residing there'
He has many such palaces
Why don't you ask around there?
Let's spend the night hereand look for him in the morning
We can't go backwithout finding the king
Father, I'm hungry
Where will I find foodat this time of the night?
Please bear with your hungertill tomorrow morning
We are all as hungryas this little boy
Yes, chief
Sir?
Who is it?
We were toldwe can get food here
Come inside and sit
Come
Eat this 'puttu' firstFood is getting ready
You said you were hungry
Eat...why are yougetting distracted?
Please eat
Bharathi, dear
Welcome, father
Eat firstWe can talk later
Al of you eat
What's all this?I can't bear to see you like this
I am fine, father
You must be hungryPlease eat
Where's Collector sir?
He's in the backyard
You first eat
Oh gawd!
I have sinned
What I did was unforgivable
When did you come?
Please forgive me
Forgive this sinner
How can you say this?You're all big shots
More than you?!
Stop crying, pleaseWhen did they come?
- Just now, sir- Did they eat?
No
First serve them dinner
Okay
"A conch even if burntremains white, dude"
"There's an air about nobilityThey carry a definite dignity"
"Even if exiled by our societyour king will always be royalty"
"Even if fallen from gracehelping hand is never in disgrace"
"Even if he loses his landand everything in hand..."
"...no one can rob this engineerof his inimitable cheer"
"Truth will triumph one day whenthis world will glorify you then"
"Only you, this village will claimis a man worthy of name and fame"

"Don't give up hopeDon't lose faith and mope"
"Don't be low-spiritedDon't be brokenhearted"
"Trust in 'This too shall pass'It'll be the nightmare that was"
How was the dinner?
Was that dinner?It was a royal feast!
Feast, huh?
How is the dam?
It must have withstoodthe wind and stormy weather
UnshakableAs strong as you
No one can shake iteven for a 1000 years more
How are our people back home?
Forget all thatWhy are you like this?
You saw me as a king,Collector, engineer
And now you're seeing meas a cook, you mean that?
What work we chooseto do isn't important
But it is important tolove whatever we do
You gave comfort and stabilityto people in 36 villages
But now...like this-
What do I lack?
I have this hall built by my fatherto welcome tired travellers
I have the means to feedmy guests without saying 'no'
Didn't you see the cowsgiving us fresh milk daily?
What else do I need?
You sold your palaceYou lived a life of royalty-
I'm the king here too!Your daughter is the queen
Am I a king only ifI live in a palace?
Wherever one is, to be happyand to give people what they lack...
...whoever follows thisway of life, is a king
However much you may justify...
...we want to see youas king like we did before
This isn't good enough
We'll return the landsyou gave us villagers
You buy backthe palaces you sold
May you live as the king we lovefor 100 years majestically
Even now I can go backto my old life if I wish
I'm educated withample mental strength
And my bodyhas a firm backbone
But I've seen that side of life
I like my present lifestyle
I asked my wife BharathiShe said she's happy this way
If heart beatswith happiness...
...one can be happy anywhere
If that joy is missing herewherever one goes-
Sir, come back to our village
We'll treat you like royalty
In my lifetime I wanted to leavesomething memorable behind
Solaiyur dam is my identity
Having built itmy work there is over
Don't hold whateverhappened in your heart
Sammandham-
Why rake up the past?
Forget it
Son-in-law?
Can I call you so?
Can he call me'son-in-'law'?
Very funny!
At least come and openthe temple you closed
What's broken oncecannot be patched up
Please don't compel me
I'll take leave
See you, Bharathi'ka
See you, dear
Father...?
If I feel like seeingyou and my mother...
...I'll send wordWill you visit me?
Karunakara, come here
Tell the people back homethe king is happy in his palace
If you tell all this, they won'tunderstand and they'll feel sad
We toiled for their happinessPlease keep that in mind
But Your majesty, when you are readyto forgive us, come back to Solaiyur
The temple you builtwill until then be closed
This is a promiseI make on myself!
The promise madeby my father...
...has come true today70 years later, through his heir
Just as the king wished...
...the temple has been openedon Lord Shiva's Holy night
And the sacred offeringto God has been made
And the man who madethis happen for us...
...you're accusing himof being a thief?
Not just this idol
The temple, dam, green fields and100s of villages around this place...
...all belong to his family
They gave it to usgraciously as charity
Why would he stealhis own possessions?
Lingaa...?
Why Lingaa?
Don't call me Lingaa hereafter
Call me Lingeswara
I'm privileged to have beennamed after my grandfather
You said you weregoing back home...why?
I don't want to spoil his name
Wait, I won't stop you
Take it
My grandfather kept thisin memory of king Lingeswara
Son, hear me out
The king didn't tell mein my dream to open the temple
That was a lie
The chief engineerwho inspected the dam said
'If you want to save this villageopen the doors of the temple'
We've opened the temple nowas per the engineer's last wish
But we are in the dark aboutthe danger in store for this village
Villagers think the engineer waskilled by a wild deer, that's not true
I saw 4 men stab and kill him
When we thought our villagewill be totally destroyed...
...the king, your grandfathercame in time to save all of us
Once again our village isfacing danger 70 years later
Only you must protect us
To save the village, why didhe want the temple opened?
But we were the oneswho opened the temple
Hey! Give meyour yellow bag
'A very good morningto viewers of Public TV'
'In order to createCancer awareness...'
'...Mr Nagabooshan, MP of Solaiyurhas released a latex hot air balloon'
Greetings, sir
You're putting upyour price it seems
I can't do it, sir
I'm too scared to do it
Let me go, sir
This is exactlywhat he also said
I won't
I won't bow downto your vile threats
The dam IS strong
I've certified it faces no dangersealed and even signed it
That's what I want
Where is it?
It's safe and soundin the place it should be
Hey! Go in and search
Get hold of him
As soon as you gethis report, burn it
If I don't find it?
Burn the house down
Hey listen!
If Uthaman bore the bruntof the wild deer's antlers...
...remember you've taken15 million from me as advance
You'll end upas a mound of ash!
Don't, sir
Tell me what I should do
You'll come tomorrowfor the dam inspection, right?
You'll be drilling a holefor 50 meters, right?
In those small holes, place bombsgiven by my men and connect them
Certify the dam is weakand you can go your way
Will the bomb explode, sir?
I'll detonate them one by one
The explosion will be drownedby the sound of the water
But if the dam breaksbecause of the explosion?
Bomb is mineVillage is also mine
Will I destroymy own constituency?
Go...goSee you tomorrow
He wants to discusssomething important
He'll be here anytime, madam
Hey Latchu
Why did youwant to see me?
Sit inside
How much longershould I wait for you?
Did I ask you to wait?
You didn't
But you know this isa childhood bond!
I know
Even my beard is going grey!
You didn't have it dyedaspiring for a minister's post!
Look at that!
Come and talk tomy grandpa tomorrow
Is it raining or what?Today is my lucky day!
Luck always piles up in a heap
That's also said of troubleIt never rains but pours!
Call the contractor
Why are youblocking the road?
To find out whyyou've assembled here
As if you don't know!
None of you know?
We have come toinspect the dam
With the Court order
And police protection
Hey! Is he trying to scare us?
Are we thieves to be scared of them?As if we've never seen a cop!
You came and inspectedthis same dam last month
What happened to that?
Good question
This has becomea habit for them!
Tell him, he hasevery right to ask
True, our engineer cameto inspect the dam
But he died beforehe could submit his report
He didn't dieof natural causes
He was murdered
Look, that's a different case
If the engineer hadsubmitted his report...
...then our visit nowis totally unnecessary
Who told you thathe didn't submit a report?
Certifying this dam will bestrong even after 1000 years...
...sealing it with Govt stamp,signed and scanned
...it has been throwninside the temple
Everything insidethe temple was old
Only this 'rudraksha' was new
This new armor against negative vibeshas come to save our old dam
Insert this pendrive intoyour laptop and check
Get your laptop
Okay sir
Oh no! You deleted it
It's on its way alreadyon a worldwide procession
Too late to try andpush it under the rug
Sir, its already in Facebook,Email, Twitter, V-chat, I chat-
Enough!
They got the message
- Lingaa?- Sir
They've anyway come hereLet them do their duty and go
If the previous reportis endorsed again...
...it is to our advantage!
MP sir, they aren't hereto inspect the dam
But to place bombsto destroy the dam
Who said so?
You did
What do you mean?
Lakshmi sweetheart, you recordedall that he said in your OB van
Please play it for him
LED screen ready?
Look over there
She's a very bad girl, sir
See you
No one can guess whereshe will place the camera
Look thereYou can't miss it
Good news!
We'll get the certificate tomorrowattesting that the dam is damaged
You've paid meonly half the money
Transfer the remaining amount40 billion into my Swiss account
We just won't miss it this time
They aren't comingto inspect the dam
But to place the bombsin strategic points
Even if anyone files a caseto the Supreme Court...
...that the dam is strong
If they come and check,dam will obviously be weak!
Transfer the money tomorrow
Yov! Playing the foolwith me or what?
Did I use my party,office and influence...
...to build a new damfor 400 billion bucks
And got sanctionfrom the centre?
You're cribbing topay me a 20% commission?
You'll also earn25 to 30%, right?
Transfer the money immediately
Why glare at her?She's my girl
I had my doubts about you
That's why I sent Lakshmito your balloon function
- You...!- Hey!!
Scumbag!
You move 1 step forwardI'll burn you alive
Now I know you murderedthat poor engineer
You pride yourself in being...
...a Member of Parliament?
You tried to kill the peoplewho voted for you?
How can he kill us?
We'll squash him to a pulp
Come on
Hey Lingaa! You take 1 step forwardmy men will kill your innocent people
I'll kill this girl
Don't move
Is there only1 dam in India?
Your depositis safe with me
If not this contractI can get you another
Listen to me
You don't know aboutmy political connections
Crap!
Drive straightto Madurai airport
Speed up
With bashed up faces...
...are you tryingto blow up our dam?
Move itOr I'll shoot
What are you saying?
I'll convey the message to him
They've dismissed youfrom the party
I lost 40 billion
I lost my dignityamongst the villagers
I lost my post as MP now
The girl I wanted to marrybackstabbed me in every way
After everything is ruined for mewhy should this village alone exist?
Not just Lingaa
The dam that was of no use to meshould also be destroyed
Hey...hey...drive straightto the balloon function place
Get the nitro glycerinebomb we have stocked
Put it inside a balloon
I'm on my way there
How much longer?
We'll go upin a little while, sir
Go...go up fast
I don't know anythingabout this, I'm not involved
You think you can escape afterdoing all these villainous acts
Yeah...via Sri Lanka
There's a yachtwaiting for me
It won't happen
Who can stop me?
Look over there
Hello...!Bike is cool
But it has no wings,my dear fellow
How long will it taketo be right above the dam?
3 minutes accordingto my calculation, sir
Set the timer for 3 minutes
I'll strap the bombon to you and wheeeeeeee!
In another 3 minutes,you, your Lingaa...
...the dam his grandfather built,this village, everything
...will go up in smoke
What are you doing?
I will kill you
Switch on the burner
Get up andswitch it on
Strap the bomb on to her
Lingaa, are you ok-
Lakshmi
Hold
Hold on tight
You're a respected elder and howcan you bow your hands to me?
I feel I am seeingKing Lingeswara in person
Why don't you livewith us here, son?
This is your village
I'll take leave, sir
Let me achieve somethingto prove I lived in this world
And then I'll be back
In the last minutethey blew our cover
Our dignity and self respectwill be in tatters
I thought I shouldn't tarnishmy grandfather's name
Looks like that isa pipedream, Lingeswara
Oh! The mastermind, huh?
I was wondering why he hadn'tmade his special appearance?!
Do you know who he is?
He's 'Finishing Kumar'
Asst. Commissioner
However important a case, he'll onlygive his finishing 'Celluloid' touch!
Why are you saluting me, sir?
I came here to catch youwith proper evidence
But after hearingyour grandfather's story...
...I got a new foundrespect for you
Sir, what's the problem?
Don't worry
Since he saved the damand protected the people here...
...Govt is conferring an award
So I've come in person toescort him right royally!
My friend!
We are well known police
Still there's a minor enquiry
Will you get intothe jeep quietly?
Thanks a ton for savingour self respect, sir
Welcome
