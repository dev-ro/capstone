Where are yOu gOing?.
ThOught we shOuld all have a little
talk since we're bOth new at Our jObs.
Why did yOu gO
tO the gaMbling place, huh?.
We had the saMe arrangeMent Over
a lOng periOd Of tiMe.
No policeman ever go to gambling club.
FOOlish Man. Rude. I'M gOing
tO have tO tell yOur superiOrs.
Well, it won't be the first time,
Uncle Harry.
I'M glad yOu guys are here.
Saves Me sOMe lung pOwer.
This is it. I'll give it to you fast.
There's a new marshal in town.
Me. New marshal means new rules.
New rules means no more street
violence. You collar the gangs.
I dOn't wanna see their fucking faces
unless they're serving Me in a restaurant.
I dOn't care what yOu dO.
Get theM jObs catching cOckrOaches.
Get theM Off the streets.
- NObOdy can cOntrOl the gangs.
EverybOdy knOws that.
TOO big a prObleM.
Captain, ChinatOwn behind yOu
all the way.
In favor of what you do.
You take gang kid in the alley.
You put bag over their head.
You beat them with club.
ChinatOwn behind yOu 1 00 percent.
- one hundred percent.
GOOd, because l'M gOnna need yOur help.
I'm gonna put a stop to all this
bribe-paying and extortion to gangs.
I want the help of all 60 families...
...and Merchant assOciatiOns.
I want yOu peOple--
Wait a Minute, captain. This is
very difficult. Very, very difficult.
There's a long history.
FOr thOusands Of years,
Chinese dO nOt gO tO the pOlice.
If they gO tO the pOlice,
they'll get in trOuble.
SO I'll tell yOu straight.
NObOdy will cOMe tO see yOu.
You tell him what we mean.
NO disrespect is intended
tO the pOlice by Our reMarks.
But if the citizens Of ChinatOwn regard
what yOu call extOrtiOn and bribery...
...as part Of the cOst Of business, and have
felt that way fOr thOusands Of years...
...why shOuld yOu be sO cOncerned?.
What abOut the Ones
that dOn't wanna pay?.
You tell him.
When I first came to New York,
I worked as a waiter in a restaurant.
SOMething terrible happened
because My bOss did nOt want tO pay.
I signed a cOMplaint against
a gang leader whO was arrested.
Next day, he was Out On the streets again.
Now, six months go by before his trial...
...and the pOlice chief was transferred
tO the BrOnx.
This was, what, six Or seven
chiefs befOre McKenna?.
Seven.
And the new chief drOpped the charges.
Three MOnths later I
gOt stabbed right here.
ShOw hiM. See?.
YOu Must understand, captain. TO us,
yOur GOOd SaMaritan was a fOOl...
...tO risk the security Of his faMily
tO help a stranger.
You're too impressed with yourself.
Fuck you.
What did yOu say?.
- I said, fuck yOu.
I'm tired of all this
'Chinese this, Chinese that.'
YOu peOple, yOu think gaMbling,
extOrtiOn, cOrruptiOn are kOsher?.
Because it's 1 000 years old?.
Well, all this 1 000-year-Old stuff,
it's a lOt Of shit tO Me.
This is AMerica yOu're living in,
and it's 200 years Old.
SO yOu better get yOur clOcks fixed.
YOu're nOt special,
and yOu're nOt beyOnd the law...
...any MOre than the PuertO Ricans
Or the POlacks.
SO we're all gOnna Obey the law
the way it says.
SO start dOing sOMething abOut it,
and fast. or yOu're all gOnna suffer.
You can believe that.
How will we deal with this?.
Morning, Stan.
Morning, Stan.
- Hi, Stan.
Morning, Stan.
- Morning, Stan.
He's early.
- He's always early.
I got a complaint about you already.
- There's a line around the block.
Harry Yung is very upset
abOut yOu busting...
...intO his place Of business
On a day Of MOurning.
He says yOu're threatening
the arrangeMent we've always had.
What is this arrangeMent?. Is it carved in...
stOne?. Did it cOMe
Out Of a burning bush?.
What the hell did you rush in there for?.
You made them lose face,
you made us lose face.
They were just sitting there,
having breakfast.
What kind Of evidence
did yOu have tO gO in there?.
With these people, you won't have any.
- You're talking shit, Stanley.
Lou, I didn't buy this job.
You gave it to me.
I tOld yOu tO kick ass
On the yOuth gangs, nOt the Old guys.
YOu lay Off theM, yOu hear?.
The 5th Precinct's a nice,
quiet area, Stanley.
GOOd springbOard fOr prOMOtiOn.
Lou, l've been down there one day.
DOesn't take a genius tO figure Out
sOMething's gOing On.
BlOOd's gOnna flOw in the gutters.
They're gOnna Muscle acrOss Canal.
They're gOnna push the Mafia Out.
I'M talking banks, real estate, drug MOney--
Who told you this?. The DEA?.
They've been peddling that
Chinese Mafia theOry fOr years.
And they never Made a case
in ChinatOwn. I wOuldn't believe nOthing.
YOu dOn't knOw what yOu're talking abOut.
The mafia concept's not even ltalian.
It's Chinese.
It's Chinese.
It was invented in China 1 000 years agO.
They call theM triads.
That's what we have here. We have
the OffshOOts Of the HOng KOng triads.
You're letting your imagination run.
- No, Lou, like hell I am.
These peOple are the biggest Overall
iMpOrters Of herOin in this cOuntry.
And the fact that we dOn't have
One single bust...
...against One Of these guys
tells Me sOMething.
They're sMart, LOu. They're sMarter
than yOu and Kearney, this lrish Sphinx.
At least I didn't change My naMe, Wizynski.
What do you want?.
YOu want tO attack ChinatOwn
with the 82nd AirbOrne?.
You're not in Vietnam here, Stanley.
There, I never saw the eneMy. Here,
they're right in frOnt Of My eyes.
They gOt nO place tO hide, nO jungle.
This is just like the South Bronx.
You got a bunch of juvenile delinquents.
YOuth gangs. Call theM what yOu want.
SnOt-nOsed Chinks, scuMbags.
Now go and kick their asses.
You're good at it.
Youth gangs?. These are midget hit men.
- You know what your problem is?.
YOu MOve thrOugh this departMent
like heavy Machinery.
NObOdy likes yOu, Stanley.
They tell yOu yOu're a great cOp,
but they dOn't like yOu.
SO what?.
Just put my request through, will you?.
Kearney, talking tO yOu
is like One hand clapping.
All Of a sudden this jOb's
Made yOu an expert.
He's got a thing for Chinks.
COnnie, l'M hOMe.
- ln here.
Where yOu been?. I've been calling
fOr twO days.
You don't answer the phone anymore?.
COnnie?.
What the hell's gOing On here?.
DOn't ask. It's the washing Machine again.
And while I was at it, I fixed the sink.
Jesus. COnnie, why dOn't yOu
ever call the repairMan?.
You're living in the past, Stanley.
You find one.
Hey, look at this mess.
Buy Me a new Machine.
But dOn't break My balls, Stanley.
Been trying tO fix this thing
fOr three hOurs, and l'M nOt in the MOOd.
I didn't say anything.
- YOu were gOnna, weren't yOu?.
I can always tell.
What the hell's wrOng with yOu?. I walk
in the dOOr, yOu dOn't even say hellO.
YOu dOn't sMile. All yOu dO is say,
'Stanley, dOn't break My balls.'
What kind of relationship is this?.
- You don't care about our relationship.
I do care.
I do care about our relationship.
oh, cOMe On.
I just wanna knOw why
yOu're sO angry all the tiMe.
Well, Stanley, it's because you have
become an arrogant, self-centered...
...cOndescending sOn Of a bitch.
There's a lot to be arrogant about--...
oh, dOn't start, Okay?. I'M nOt
taking any MOre Of yOur shit, Stan.
You wanna fix the fucking washing
machine?. You go ahead and fix it.
You fix it. I gotta go to work.
Hey, lOOk, l'M nOt having
such a great day, either.
I thought you said you had the night off.
I thOught Maybe we cOuld gO Out.
- They shifted Me back tO nights.
What is biting your ass?.
Don't tell me it's the washing machine.
No. Nothing.
I don't expect anything from you.
- What is that supposed to mean?.
It means you bombed out.
You forgot. You weren't here.
You missed target practice.
What?.
- Wednesday.
Wednesday.
It's the day Of My OvulatiOn.
I guess I forgot.
Don't bullshit me, Stan.
I don't like it.
I'm getting the picture, okay?.
It's clear as ice.
lf yOu really wanted a kid--
- of cOurse I want a kid.
NO, nO. YOu'd take care Of yOurself a bit.
You'd sleep decent hours, you'd eat
regular, you'd take your vitamins.
YOu prOMised Me yOu'd
take yOur vitaMin E.
I paid 50 bucks for this.
YOu'd screw Me Once in a while
at the right tiMe Of the MOnth.
How do we stand a chance?.
Hey, l'M sOrry.
- I knOw.
YOu said that last MOnth
and the MOnth befOre that.
I'll tell you what, next month,
we'll take a weekend off.
We'll go up to that place in the Poconos.
The place yOur brOther-in-law's
always talking abOut.
The place with the heart-shaped tubs?.
We could try there.
Don't give me all that.
Don't treat me like an idiot.
It doesn't work anymore.
It doesn't work.
Shit.
GOOd evening, Miss Tzu.
- Hi. HOw are yOu?.
We're very happy yOu

Thanks.
- This way, please.
This is Miss Tzu.
How do you do?.
- Hello.
We're so pleased you've come.
- Thank you.
I didn't think you'd show up.
I wanted a closer look at the jerk
who insulted me on the street.
What would you like to drink?.
- Tea.
Why didn't yOu tell Me whO yOu were?.
- HOstile, aren't yOu?.
I showed up, didn't l?.
Why dOn't yOu have sOMe spareribs.
They have great spareribs here, but
lOusy lighting. Ever wOnder abOut that?.
Why the inside Of a Chinese restaurant
Makes yOu feel like yOu're at the DMV?.
Feel like l'm waiting for an eye test.
You know, the atmosphere is not the thing.
Besides, I like ltalian food better anyway.
I'M iMpressed.
Are yOu dOing yOur hOMewOrk?.
Scratching the surface.
YOu're frOM HOng KOng?.
NO, AMerican-bOrn.
San FranciscO, the Bay area.
HOw Many generatiOns
have yOur peOple been here?.
My great-grandfather caMe,
wOrked in the railrOads, went back.
My grandfather wOrked in a gOld Mine.
He alsO went back.
They went back because the law
wouldn't allow their wives to come.
My father Married a Japanese wOMan
and settled here in the '40s.
Yeah, I know the story.
It's a pretty sad one.
ThOusands Of yOu Chinese
caMe Over here...
...and died building the railrOads
in this cOuntry. Says sO right here.
Their bOnes are scattered all Over
the West. We dOn't even knOw their naMes.
There's a photograph here.
Promontory Point, Utah, 1 869.
That's where the UniOn
and Central Pacific first Met.
Take a look at it. What do you see?.
What dO yOu see?. YOu
see the bOsses. YOu...
see the pOliticians. YOu see the bankers.
YOu see the lrish wOrkMen. There's
nOt One single, sOlitary ChinaMan.
They weren't even asked tO shOw up.
They died anOnyMOus.
GOddaMn peOple,
yOu keep everything a secret.
I know the story, captain.
Most people don't. Because no one
remembers in this country.
NO One reMeMbers anything.
YOu sOund just like My father.
- He sOunds like a great guy.
What does he do?.
He's in shipping. Now what's your story?.
Me?. What's there to say?.
I'm Polish.
I'm from Brooklyn. I'm a cop.
But I happen tO be the MOst decOrated cOp
in the city Of New YOrk.
I'm talking action-decorated,
no desk citations here.
l'm sure about that.
- I saw you a few times on the tube.
I dOn't watch Much televisiOn,
but I think yOu're pretty gOOd.
And a whOle lOt sexier than
thOse brOads On Other channels.
Well, captain, very pleased
you've come. Hello.
Uncle Yung, yOu knOw Tracy Tzu?.
- oh, yes. Very pleased yOu've cOMe.
This is My wife, Su Shin.
Captain, dO yOu like Chinese chaMpagne?.
This is very gOOd.
This is On the hOuse, huh?.
Thanks, Harry, but no, thanks.
I pay my own way.
Fish stinks from the head, right?.
The Chinese eat the head, captain.
EnjOy.
Let's go.
Looks like champagne, anyway.
I think you upset him.
- I certainly hope so.
LOOk at it this way.
Harry Yung...
...is the head Of the richest tOng
in ChinatOwn.
He's gOtta be invOlved
in the Chinese Mafia.
Even if he isn't doing anything,
he's gotta be doing something.
And if I can nail the sOn Of a bitch,
and he's gOt face, I get face.
And if I get face,
I can win the war in ChinatOwn.
Captain?. Why did yOu call Me?.
What dO yOu want?.
I'll tell yOu what I want. I want
the rice tO bOil Over in ChinatOwn.
I wanna change things.
Why?. Is ChinatOwn sO bad the way it is?.
It stinks. Harry Yung's gOt this place
lOcked up like a jail.
GOt a slave pOpulatiOn Of sweatshOp
wOMen wOrking fOr 1 2 cents a piece.
YOu gOt shOpkeepers paying bribes
tO every punk that cOMes alOng.
You got 30 people living in a room.
YOu gOt the highest rate
Of TB and Mental illness...
...in any city neighbOrhOOd.
You got a male population--
Look, l'm a reporter.
I am not a crusader.
You're an actress. I can help you.
- How?.
I'll give you hard facts off the record.
You do one of those
exposés on Chinatown.
one week yOu dO
the gaMbling cOnnectiOn.
The next week yOu dO
the yOuth gang extOrtiOn racket.
YOu MOve up the ladder
tO the bOsses that Own the places.
You splash their faces on the tube.
Take a little journalistic license.
Each week we peel anOther layer
Off the OniOn.
If it was sOMe white brOad, they'd say it's
racist. But with yOu, it's On the up and up.
This is outrageous. There are
boundaries, captain. Ethics.
The press is independent,
nOt just anOther undercOver cOp.
What yOu're asking is absurd.
It's alMOst criMinal.
YOu wOuldn't knOw a real criMinal
if One bit yOu On the ass.
I dOn't think there's any pOint
in gOing On with this.
YOu sit dOwn. YOu get sMart.
And yOu listen tO Me.
GO fuck yOurself.
Stanley.
Didn't see nothing happen.
Two men. Ski masks.
Ran up the stairs.
It was all over.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all over now.
It's all right. It's all right.
StOp crying. StOp crying.
StOp crying.

our banking and shipping prOfits

GOld prices are sluMping,
Our stOcks are sluggish.
our cOMMOdities have slipped.
There's nO new MOney cOMing in,
gentleMen.
SOOn the VietnaMese will start cOMpeting
with Our gaMbling prOfits.
And this new pOliceMan...
...Making rude nOises abOut ChinatOwn
and justice, and all.
Right?.
Then there's the Matter with the ltalians.
It is perhaps tiMe tO cOnsider ending
the Old arrangeMent with theM.

I wouldn't bet on that information, sir.
- You know something they don't?.
NO, sir, but just that Our street infOrMatiOn

We're the last ones to know

And if I can get tO theM, and I will,

...and I'll penetrate these fuckers.
What are yOu talking abOut?.
You took this request to your C.O.?.
- Yes, sir, and it was ignored.
As was My warning that the gutters
were gOnna run red with blOOd.
The request is under cOnsideratiOn,
cOMMissiOner.
This kid he wants is a trainee.
He's already gOt six Chinese cOps.
I got six too many.
I got six Chinese cops down there...
...nO One talks tO. They're like lepers.
This kid, Herbert Kwong, he's from China.
No one knows him down there.
And he dOn't knOw shit frOM ShinOla.
He needs anOther 1 00 hOurs, MiniMuM.
We don't have another 1 00 hours.

And get sOMe results.
That's it.
NObOdy dOes what yOu did in here.

You will freeze in that position.
You will not move.

What about sleep?.
- Forget sleep.
But I got a second job.

You wanna be a cop or fuck around?.
What's the point of the exercise?.

Bullshit.
SOMe say it was an act Of revenge

In this Once quiet cOMMunity,
tOurists are beginning tO stay away...
...and the peOple here
are beginning tO ask:
'What's happening to Chinatown?.'
COnnie's waiting at the restaurant.

YOu Must've heard we dug up
thOse twO Midgets that hit Harry's place.
Found them in a soybean basement.
- No, I didn't.
My guess is, sOMebOdy didn't

You think it was the friends of the boy
who was killed?.
If yOu accept the surface Of things, JOey,
which MOst peOple dO.
Why the bOdyguard?.

Hey, what dO yOu want, JOey?.
Spit it Out.
Cigarette?.

Well, why don't you make it easy?.
I'll help yOu get
sOMe Of these renegade yOuths.
Witnesses, evidence,

You get headlines, your superiors

YOu understand what l'M saying

Yeah. I get the punks.
What do you want in return?.
Nothing.
Just work with us.
Chinese peOple cOMe here tO prOsper,

A peasant.
YOu gOtta Make things real clear tO Me.

This the way yOu MOved Out Harry Yung?.
How about your father-in-law,
Jackie Wong?.
RuMOr has it, it yOur hand that

You're a smart guy, Go Joey,

Kid frOM the sluMs Of KOwlOOn

That's the AMerican dreaM. Why dOn't
yOu shine a light On the sOn Of a bitch?.
What if he's involved in nothing?.
What if he's just a successful
businessman, like my father?.
The Chinese are always invOlved
in sOMething.
They're never invOlved in nOthing.
You remember that.
YOu're really cracked, yOu knOw that?.
The first time I saw you, I knew
you were cracked. And a racist too.
Were you in Vietnam?.
Yeah, why?.
- I knew it.
It ruined you.
The first tiMe I saw yOu,
I hated yOur guts.
I think I even hated you
before I ever met you.
I hated you on TV.
I hated you in Vietnam.
YOu wanna knOw what's destrOying
this cOuntry?. It's nOt bOOze.
It's not drugs. It's TV, it's media.
It's people like you. Vampires.
I hate the way that yOu Make yOur living,
sticking MicrOphOnes in peOple's faces.
I hate hOw yOu lie every night at 6:00.
I hate the way yOu kill real feelings.
I hate everything that yOu stand fOr.
MOst Of all, I hate rich kids.
And I hate this place.
SO why dO I wanna fuck yOu sO bad?.
Maybe yOu're right.
Maybe I gOt nO ethics.
I can't. StOp it.
- What dO yOu Mean, yOu can't?.
I spent all afternOOn here Making
lOve with My bOyfriend. I can't.
SO why did yOu invite Me here?.
What year are yOu living in?.
We're nOt in the back seat Of sOMe car

What is he, rich?.
You wanna know if he's Chinese, right?.
That's what you wanna know. So ask it.
That's the questiOn,
sO why dOn't yOu answer it.
He's white, all right.
He went to Princeton.
His name's Roger. And he's a lawyer.
Well, I hate lawyers.
I wOuldn't wanna Make lOve tO a wOMan...
...whO just gOt dOne screwing

What's he got, money?.
Roger Pumpernickel lll?.
And he's nOt a crackpOt racist.
He's a gentleMan.

He plays tennis and gOlf
and gOes Out sailing On a yacht?.
What's with all these machines?.
What are you, at AT&T?.
You got everybody in town jumping

You're acting like a child.
A great Man is One whO, in ManhOOd,

Why dOn't yOu gO hOMe?.
I can see this was a big mistake.
Yeah, it was a Mistake,
it was a giant Mistake.
It was a giant mistake.
I'm gonna go home to a woman
who at least acts like a woman.
If this ROger's sO great,
hOw cOMe he didn't he Marry yOu?.
He didn't want a little slant-eyed
Roger lV at Princeton?.
We've never discussed it.
We just meet here to fuck.
I wanna arrest the gang members for
loitering, spitting in the gutter, anything.
What about their civil rights?.
- Fuck their civil rights.
I want the hOnchOs arOund here
tO gO ape-shit.
I wanna disrupt the entire cOMMerce
Of ChinatOwn.
Do you understand me?.
I want chaos.
YOu knOw, yOu peOple, yOu're starting
tO lOOk like the ChicagO Cubs.
I'm not kidding.
YOu lOOk like yOu already lOst.
The wOrld has fucked yOu Over.
SO nOw yOu dOn't give a shit.
I know. I've been there.
I've been in the jOb 1 5 years.
I knOw all the stOries.
My heart has been broken 1 00 times.
I've got scar tissue on my soul.
But let Me tell yOu sOMething.
I give a shit.
I'm gonna make you people give a shit.
I don't care what you think of me.
YOu guys are gOnna gO
thrOugh the nuMbers
On this One. NOw, that's it. Get Out Of here.
Whoa. One last thing.
The next cop...
...that I hear abOut whO's
taking MOney in this precinct...
...I'M gOnna persOnally bust their MOuth.
Are there any questiOns?.
What if it's a woman?.
She better bend Over.
Mr. Wong, do you think Joey Tai is
responsible for the death of your father?.
NO way. I want My lawyer.
Double-parked cars have been towed.
Captain Stanley White, the MOst
decOrated cOp in New YOrk City...
...has declared war on Chinatown.
TOday there were 43 gang arrests...
...three gaMbling parlOrs raided,
six sweatshOps busted.
And nOw in an Opening blOw at the Man...
...whO's been called the GOdfather
Of ChinatOwn, JOey Tai...
...Captain White clOsed his restaurant
On a health viOlatiOn.
Needless tO say, a crackdOwn
is in the wOrks.
And althOugh the district attOrney
denies it...
...a MajOr drug cOnspiracy case
is ruMOred tO be pending...
...against variOus respected
Older MeMbers Of the ChinatOwn elite.
Mr. Tai, can yOu tell us if there is
such a thing as the Chinese Mafia?.
It sOunds very exciting.
Like a cOMic bOOk.
The existence Of triads is dOcuMented
by the Drug EnfOrceMent Agency.
Documentation without proof.
This farce is further evidence
Of the cOnsistent discriMinatiOn...
...against Chinese in this cOuntry.
Mr. Tai, are yOu saying there is nO
criMinal eleMent in all Of ChinatOwn?.
of cOurse nOt.
But why dO yOu Media peOple insist
On eMphasizing...
...this sinister Charlie Chan iMage?.
Why dOn't yOu talk abOut the chair
in Chinese histOry...
...Our assOciatiOn has endOwed
at Yale University...
...Or Our $1 2 MilliOn fund
fOr Our 1 0,000 MeMbers...
POsitive things.
- What is yOur cOMMent On Jackie WOng?.
Mr. Tai, dO yOu have any cOMMent
On Jackie WOng?.
I'm happy you could make it, Teddy.
I'M really happy yOu are Okay.
My dOctOr wOuld kill Me
if he knew I was here.
They just tOOk My vOice bOx Out.
They keep taking things Out.
I have nOthing left, Fred...
...but my brain.
My brain says I'd rather dO business...
...with a sMart thief than
an hOnest Man whO is stupid.
A stupid Man is dangerOus,
like a defective tiMe bOMb.
YOu never knOw when
it's gOnna gO Off On yOu.
But a thief, you can control what he steals.
I think, Teddy, yOu are gOing
tO find JOey a very sMart yOung Man.
Not cautious as Jackie or Harry,
but aggressive.
He wants power.
All yOung Men want pOwer.
That's what it Means tO be yOung, Fred.
I wanna see his face, his eyes.
I wanna knOw if he's reckless.
one lOOk in his eyes, I will knOw.
Bring him in.
But leave the nigger outside.
My esteemed friends are diplomatic.
- HOw's the sOund?.
A little backgrOund nOise,
but nOt tOO bad.
The point, Mr. Tedesco...
...is that we are happy to let you
continue the distribution of our software.
But, with a 50 percent reduction
in volume...
...and at a reduced fee.
SOMething like 1 7 Or 1 8 percent.
The rest stays with us
till we weigh Other Offers.
Jackie WOng Made these arrangeMents
with Me.
We were pioneers when you
were sucking your mother's tit.
And I dOn't see
why anything shOuld change nOw.
Because Jackie Wong is dead.
And Harry Yung has stepped dOwn,
and I aM the ChO Kun nOw.
Hey, JOey.
And I say we can't affOrd tO sell
tO Old Men the Old way.
You know, Fred, in all my years...
...nObOdy, and I Mean nObOdy's
ever talked tO Me like that. NObOdy.
No insult was intended, Mr. Tedesco.
But yOu peOple dOn't cOntrOl
Canal Street anyMOre.
We do.
I think when yOu think
thrOugh My Offer tO yOu...
...yOu'll see that it's nOt unprOfitable
tO bOth sides.
WhO yOu gOnna sell tO?.
The niggers?. The spics?.
YOu peOple dOn't have
that kind Of weight here.
They will bury yOu sO fast
like yOu never was here.
And if they dOn't, I will.
Don't talk like that.
- Don't sweat it.
YOu're flying tOO high, kid,
and the air is very thin up there.
We got anything?.
It seeMs tO be MOstly financial talk,
captain.
There is mention of some problem
in Thailand.
A Man in BangkOk is saying
sOMething abOut....
I'm not quite sure about what.
But he's very angry abOut a grOup
frOM TOrOntO called the NaM SOOng.
Sister, yOu gOtta be MOre precise.
That's gOing tO be very difficult,
captain.
It's been Many years since we've heard
the Hakka dialect spOken.
They're talking arOund things,
nOt abOut theM.
Damn it, Sister, that's the point.
They're nOt gOnna spell it Out fOr yOu.
This is drug talk.
You gotta use your imagination.
Listen.
YOu lOOk like yOu dOn't eat enOugh
tO keep a bird alive. Have sOMe real fOOd.
Captain White, I've Managed tO live
fOr 75 years withOut yOur help...
...eating precisely what l'M eating nOw.
My bOdy fat is 1 2 percent.
My blood pressure's 1 20/80.
My lyMphOcyte cOunt is 22 percent.
And if yOu want tO cOMpare white
blOOd cells and red blOOd cells...
...I Might even Outlast yOu,
captain...
...red-Meat eater that yOu ObviOusly are.
The perpetratOr is saying
he's flying intO BangkOk next week.
Under another name.
He's Making his MOve.
I want yOu tO get the DEA On hiM.
Call the BangkOk pOlice. Whatever yOu
gOtta dO tO eyeball this scuMbag.
I'm sorry, Sister.
I just wish the fuck I could go there myself.
COMe On. Back On the street.
That'll be the day. The N.Y.P.D.
springs fOr a ticket tO HOng KOng.
You guys are doing a great job.
Keep it up.
Rizzo, come on.
Hit Chinatown like Genghis Khan.
I want restaurant health viOlatiOns,
iMMigratiOn busts....
YOu were Meant tO shake up the gangs,
nOt turn the whOle city upside dOwn.
Let me make this real clear to you
right here and now.
JOey Tai gOes tO
the Manhattan bOrOugh president...
...whO he cOntributes
$1 00,000 a year tO, right?.
The borough president goes to the mayor,
who goes to me.
And the wOrd is, 'Lay Off.'
That is the way the gaMe is played, Okay?.
No more wiretaps on Joey Tai.
And yOu dOn't gO tO the DEA.
GOing tO Outside agencies
isn't yOur jOb, it is LOu's jOb.
What abOut the dead tOurists,
cOMMissiOner, huh?.
I guess they dOn't add up
tO a can Of sardines, dO they?.
YOu change yOur tune fast just because
that sliMebag has tea with the MayOr.
You can't link Joey Tai to that.
The point here is, you cease and desist.
What if I dOn't?. What are yOu
gOnna dO?. YOu gOnna suspend Me?.
What will that lOOk like
in the papers?. YOu tell Me.
First, yOu suspend Me.
SecOnd, yOu call Off...
an investigatiOn intO the Chinese Mafia.
What investigation?. What Chinese mafia?.
The investigation's in your mind.
What's it gonna look like?. You tell me.
Your department's gonna look
like shit, that's what.
ls this blackMail?.
- Call it what yOu want.
I've been swallOwing the bullshit arOund
here fOr 1 0 years, and l'M chOking On it.
You ever think about your pension?.
- Fuck it.
That's what's wrOng with this departMent.
EverybOdy's sO wOrried
abOut their pensiOn.
Stanley--
Never have I ever heard anything like this.
This is a fucking disgrace.
- No, Lou, this is a war.
I'M nOt gOnna lOse it. NOt this One. NOt
Over pOlitics. It's always fucking pOlitics.
This is Vietnam all over again.
NObOdy wants tO win this thing, dO yOu?.
Just flat out win, do they, Lou?.
YOu gO tO the press again, White,
yOu knOw what yOu're dOing?.
YOu're putting a gun tO My head, Stanley.
That's what we are.
We're fOur guys in a rOOM
with guns tO Our heads.
Kearney, will yOu step Outside
fOr a Minute?.
I can't listen tO this crap nO MOre,
Stanley.
I can't watch a good man piss
his career down the drain like this.
YOu never had any respect fOr anything.
YOu thrOw away yOur wife--...
Shut up.
- And nOw yOu're turning On us.
You got delusions of grandeur.
Sucking up tO this Chink repOrter
tO get yOur face On the tube.
What is it with yOu?. YOu gOne Chink
On us?. She dO it sideways?.
Take it back.
- Don't tell me that.
YOu gOt nO shaMe. COnnie was
the best thing yOu ever had--
That wasn't between cops, that was
between two guys from the old days.
Lou, l'm sorry.
Look, I don't know why we're fighting.
I love you, I love Connie.
When things aren't wOrking at hOMe, yOu
start Overreacting tO things On the street.
We all had flings when we were young.
I'm not a prude.
Why dOn't yOu at least sit dOwn with
COnnie and try tO straighten this Out.
Even if yOu walk away,
yOu walk away friends.
Because nO One's gOnna care when yOu're
lying in yOur grave but COnnie and Me.
Well?.
What are yOu gOnna dO, Stanley?.
I dOn't knOw.
All I knOw is that when I give up...
...the systeM gives up.
Tracy.
Tracy, open the door.
Tracy.
Tracy.

Tracy.
COMe On, Open the dOOr.
WhO dO yOu think yOu are?.
And what are yOu dOing with that?.
These are my Chinese books.
I'm moving in.

tO Me when I was On tOp Of yOu?.
Fuck you.
What's wrOng with yOu Chinese?.
Why dOn't yOu say what yOu think?.
l'M calling ROger.
- Call hiM. I've gOt things tO say tO hiM tOO.
GO away, will yOu, Stanley?.
YOu're cracked. YOu're really crazy.
DO yOu ever listen tO yOurself?.
Tell Me the truth. There is nO ROger,
is there?. YOu knOw hOw I knOw?.
It's because when yOu talk abOut hiM,
yOur eyes aren't real.
There is a Roger.
Tell Me what yOu see in this guy.
COMe On, tell Me, I wanna knOw.
I want yOu tO lOOk Me in the eyes,
and I want yOu tO say it.
What dO I have tO dO tO get yOu
Out Of here?. HOly GOd.
Nothing. It's hopeless.
Surrender.
Why aM I laughing?.
I'm becoming a crazy, like you.
I'm tired.
I think I need to sleep.
Maybe everybOdy's right.
I'M chasing sOMething that dOesn't exist.
I ought to stop.
Jesus, l'm tired.
It's the same thing as in Nam.
We lOst because yOu were sMarter than us.
And yOu cOuldn't even
have a decent parade.
A fucking Chinese parade.
They cOMe at yOu
in 1 5 different directiOns.
Fucking joke.
Stanley.
You can't stay here.
DOn't yOu have a friend I cOuld call?.
or sOMebOdy yOu cOuld
stay with tOnight?.
You're the only friend I have left.
I just wanna be with sOMebOdy
tOnight. I just....
I dOn't knOw anybOdy else.
Isn't that a real laugh?.
I dOn't knOw anybOdy.
I feel like such an asshole.
Tracy, l....
I love you.
Did you hear what I said?.
I thOught there was
nO Chinese wOrd fOr lOve.
I'm serious.
I know you are.
It was bad enOugh dOing business
with the Old general.
Ban Sung's even wOrse. But yOu lOse
all face by dealing with hiM direct.
Ban Sung's got an ego like an octopus.
- I know.
But I don't trust his agent here.
White POwder Ma knOws Ban Sung has
gOt a buMper crOp Of 1 50 tO 200 tOns.
Ma offered him 6000 a key,
plus a shipment of Kalashnikov rifles.
All right.
I'll see yOu tOnight.
- See yOu.
Thanks, bye.
Will you open the door?.
open the dOOr. What dO I gOtta dO,
break it dOwn?.
We gotta clear the air between us.
We gotta talk it out.
SO talk.
I dOn't knOw what gOt intO Me
with this Chinese girl.
I care MOre abOut yOu
than anybOdy in the wOrld.
I Mean, if yOu dOn't knOw that,
COnnie, then....
SO, what dO yOu want Me tO say?.
DO yOu want Me tO fOrgive yOu, Stanley?.
Is that what yOu want?.
The truth is,
I don't know what I want.
You wanna marry her?.
YOu wanna have babies with her?.
LOOk, I didn't plan fOr things
tO happen this way.
It just happened.
HOw dO yOu think that Makes Me feel?.
It makes me feel pretty low, Stanley.
I feel pretty low myself.
- lt's about time.
YOu used Me up, Stanley,
and then yOu burned Me dOwn.
And I was a rOck. I carried the crOss
with yOu in BrOOklyn and queens.
I lived in a fucking war zOne with yOu.
NOw yOu're gOnna gO Off and have babies
with a wOMan 1 0 years yOunger than Me.
I dOn't have any pity fOr yOu, Stanley.
I hOpe yOu feel bad.
Look, why don't we just
let things ride for a while.
Just let some time pass.
I don't have any time.
- I just need some time to think.
I'm out of time.
I'm 35, sliding into 40.
SO, what dO yOu want Me tO dO?.
YOu want Me tO just walk away,
just like that?.
Is that what you want?.
It's over, Stanley.
DOn't yOu get it?. We're nOt playing
frOM the saMe sheet Music anyMOre.
Now, will you get out of here
before I start to cry?.
And I dOn't want tO dO that.
NOt in frOnt Of yOu.
I got my pride.
Are yOu Okay?.
I'm washing my face.
Look, Connie.
I'd feel a whOle lOt better if yOu'd just
keep the hOuse and the bank accOunts.
I mean,
whatever's mine is yours.
I don't want the house, anyway.
Stanley?.
What the hell is gOing On?.
- They gOt COnnie.
Stanley. What are yOu, crazy?.
Stanley.
Stanley, get Out Of there.
Stanley.
Are yOu crazy?.
- He's evidence.
He's dead.
Long time no see, Joe Tai.
It's an hOnOr and a pleasure
tO see yOu again, general.
TiMe lOOks like it's been gOOd tO yOu.
- And tO yOu tOO, hOnOrable cOusin.
The last time, as I remember,
both of us were taking orders.
Now we give them.
HOw is the health Of Our Old friend,
the great SaO MOng Khawn...
...whO paved the gOlden rOad
Of Our success tOgether?.
Truly, he is One Of the great Ones.
He'll be happy to see you, Go Joey.
I think so.
COMe.
I think we'll surprise hiM.
Perhaps the general
dOesn't recOgnize yOu.
The general likes heroin in his soup.
Keeps him happy.
Thank all gods,
he feels no pain.
COMe, GO JOey.
A KalashnikOv.
Best rifle ever made.
The Russians used tO give theM
tO us tO fight the BurMese.
But now it's harder to get.
They want dOllars.
EverybOdy wants dOllars.
one bullet,
by the tiMe it gets tO Me...
...cOsts Me One AMerican dOllar.
Dollars are like small fish.
Difficult to catch.
But nOt tO be thrOwn back,
except as bait fOr sOMething bigger.
l'll make it 4500 a kilo.
- You give me 6500.
And I'll refine it tO nuMber fOur right here.
- NO, nO.
You'll have 200 keys
in Bangkok in two weeks.
We can't cOntrOl the quality unless
we refine it tO stage fOur Ourselves.
We've always bOught stage three.
YOu dOn't think My dragOn pearl is gOOd?.
I have the best chemists in the world.
- Maybe.
Better than yOur peOple in HOng KOng.
- Lin Shin SaO.
But then we wOuld be fOrced
tO uneMplOy Our cheMists.
GO JOey.
I Offer yOu the chance Of putting
yOur Old friend Out Of his Misery.
He was gOing tO betray us
tO the AMerican.
Hold him.
Save Me. Save Me.
No, don't.
Don't shoot me.
YOu dOn't have the bullet tO spare.
Each bullet can kill One BurMese sOldier.
Then yOu dOn't have tO use a gun.
Don't do this to me.
I'll buy hiM frOM yOu, $5000.
Buy?.
U.S. dollars. Cash. Now.
- Why?.
Why not?.
If yOu think this shit-faced Old wOrM
is wOrth $5000...
...yOu can have hiM.
- GOOd.
The food's been great...
...and yOur hOspitality has left
an iMpressiOn, general.
But time is pressing.
I must be in Hong Kong...
...before the banks close on Friday.
My final offer.
I'll Make it 4900 a key
fOr yOur nuMber three dragOn pearl.
I'll take 200 kilos deliverable
in Bangkok early next week.
AnOther 800 kilOs fOr the next
three MOnths. NOthing beyOnd that.
White POwder Ma's Offer
Makes yOurs insignificant.
Piss On hiM. NaM SOOng triad is like
dOg shit littering the streets.
They'll be extinct in twO years.
I think perhaps I put My MOney
On White POwder Ma.
I think so.
I think White Powder Ma
will be pleased to hear this.
Tell hiM yOurself, general.
I give to Ban Sung...
...in hOnOr Of Our assOciatiOn.
Let no motherless fuck ever raise
his head again between us.
COMe On,
let Me get a shOt.
COMe On.
Press. Come on, let us in.
I'M sOrry, Stanley.
She lOOks beautiful, Stanley.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Let me in.
Let me in now.
My deepest cOndOlences
tO yOu, Mr. White.
If it Makes yOu feel better,
she said it wasn't the Chinese girl.
COnnie was a bigger persOn than that.
She knew what was gOnna happen.
You should've listened to her.
You were talking to Connie
behind my back?.
Yeah, I was talking
tO COnnie behind yOur back.
I know Connie even longer than you.
Why shouldn't I talk to her if I want to?.
YOu and I dOn't agree On anything
anyMOre.
That's your problem.
You're fighting the whole world.
I'M sick and tired Of VietnaM
as an excuse fOr everything yOu guys dO.
YOu act like everyOne in WWll and KOrea
caMe hOMe tO a picnic.
Well, it wasn't.
We lost 50,000 men in Korea too.
NObOdy gave a shit.
But we fitted in.
Why can't yOu fit in?.
What is it that's sO different?.
I dOn't knOw what yOu're talking abOut.
- YOu knOw what l'M talking abOut.
YOu're nOt One Of theM
prOfessiOnal veterans...
...Making a career Of pissing
and grOaning abOut the war.
You made something out of yourself.
But yOu're still acting like yOu're
On a crusade.
YOu think yOu gOt the right
tO traMple Over anything.
We gOt an arrangeMent,
a treaty with these Chinese.
However tarnished it is, it works.
Life is arrangement, Stanley.
Life is getting alOng. That's why
this neighbOrhOOd is what it is.
That's why 8 MilliOn peOple
every day in this city can functiOn.
LOu, I dOn't wanna argue with yOu
anyMOre, all right?. HOnest, I dOn't.
Take it easy.
YOu need anything, yOu call Me,
yOu hear?.
There's always a bed at My place.
You know, your arrangement
is what killed Connie, Lou.
Mr. Tai?.
- Mr. Tai?.
Mr. Tai, people in Chinatown are saying
Ronnie Chang was your protégé.
And his invOlveMent in the Murder
Of Captain White's wife iMplicates yOu.
That was a terrible tragedy.
But I hardly knew ROnnie Chang.
ROnnie Chang represents Much
Of what is bad in ChinatOwn.
We are trying tO get rid Of this eleMent.
My sOurces say yOu're
back frOM BangkOk.
Was there a business
purpOse fOr this trip?.
I have interests there.
I import foods from the Far East.
I alsO have a cOMpany that distributes
filMs in Thailand. Why dO yOu ask?.
WOuld this business take
yOu intO the jungle...
500 Miles nOrth Of BangkOk...
...tO Meet with a reputed drug lOrd
by the naMe Of Ban Sung?.
Do you know there are ethical
boundaries, even for the press?.
Then does the name White Powder Ma
ring a bell?.
All right, cut it.
I knOw yOur sOurces. And l'M gOnna raise
the issue with yOur legal departMent.
I don't give a shit.
I got the new lady district attorney
behind me on this thing now.
DO yOu think the N.Y.P.D. is gOnna
lift a finger fOr Me?. NO.
I'm not gonna tell you where I am.
I'M gOnna Make this case with the DEA,
CustOMs and lMMigratiOn if I have tO.
The gOddaMn lnternal Affairs,
sniffing arOund again.
I'll bet yOu it's that fuck, Kearney.
Get Me Scappy Peck at CustOMs.
He owes me favors.
What did Tai say abOut White POwder Ma?.
What is all this?.
What's happened?.
I can't use my office.
The walls have ears.
I let you use this place,
but this is ridiculous.
Get Off the phOne.
And get these peOple Out Of here.
Right nOw.
Scappy Peck's On the line.
- NO. NO MOre calls.
Look at this place.
I give you an inch, and you take a mile.
I want these people out of here
right now. I mean it.
I dOn't have tiMe tO write thank-yOu nOtes.
I'M gOing fOr JOey Tai's thrOat,
and nObOdy will stOp Me.
SO just dOn't break My balls, all right?.
Just hang in there a little while, and
yOu'll be faMOus. That's what yOu want.
YOu ungrateful, Overbearing,
self-centered sOn Of a bitch.
Don't tell me what I want.
- That's it. Let me hear it.'lgnorant Polack.'
EverybOdy, get Out.
Sit dOwn.
What's so funny?.
YOu drive everybOdy crazy, nOt just Me.
But she's an aristocrat.
You can't push her around.
That's an aristocrat?.
From the North. Mandarin.
They're like that.
Call Wainwright back. This is bullshit.
We're nOt getting anywhere.
LOOk, that dOpe is between here
and Thailand. It's On the MOve.
We gotta get a tap in Tai's restaurant office.
YOu Must be kidding Me.
A white face wOuld never get in there.
lMpOssible, captain.
- COMe On.
YOu cOuld get in there as a busbOy
Or sOMething.
After that, plenty Of tiMe Off
fOr sleep, a prOMOtiOn....
NO way, captain.
- A tOugh kid frOM Kwangtung?.
Whose ancestors used to hang
in baskets in the Sierras...
...poking dynamite sticks in cliff faces.
All l'M asking yOu tO dO is
be a fly On the wall.
Your ancestors are rolling in their graves.
GOddaMn bullshit, captain. YOu're pushing
tOO Much. I'M nO slave.
I gave up my security job.
I gave up my chauffeur job.
I send less money home.
I'm tired all the time. I don't eat right.
I'M getting sick. I die, l'M fucked.
My faMily is fucked.
For what?.
- What do you mean?.
You don't care nothing for people.
You make us all die for you.
Let Me tell yOu sOMething, captain.
When yOur ancestOrs were living
in caves in POland...
...the Chinese were sailing their ships
acrOss the Pacific.
What dO yOu knOw Of My ancestOrs?.
- What dO yOu knOw abOut Mine?.
We were traders, shipbuilders, explorers.
We taught yOu agriculture. We gave yOu
the Orange, the irrigatiOn systeM.
We dug your gold and silver, Stanley.
We taught you how to fish the Pacific.
And still we were barred
frOM AMerican citizenship until 1 943.
We wOrked sO hard tO
build yOur railrOads,
then when Our OpiuM was late...
...we were so desperate,
we helped each other kill ourselves.
But l'M nOt gOnna kill Myself fOr yOu,
Captain White.
No more Chinaman Joe.
Those days are over.
He'll be back. He loves me.
LOOk, Stan, the kid's pushing it tO the liMit.
I dOn't knOw, Maybe we shOuld take hiM
Off the case.
NO undercOver has lasted
MOre than a MOnth in ChinatOwn.
Let Me tell yOu sOMething.
That kid is tOugh as nails.
And l'M gOnna Make it up tO hiM.
Mind your business.
YOu have tO reMeMber tO call.
Why dOn't yOu call nOw....
Watch what yOu say.
No problem.

Which new company?.
Shit.

I'M putting My life On the line,

You're like poison, Stanley.

Rape is rape.

Three boys.

It didn't happen tO yOu,

You don't give a shit about me, do you?.
l'm gonna kill him.
- Leave, Stanley.
GO away and leave Me alOne.
YOu shOuld take a lOOk

You're selfish, you're callous...

Your wife was right.
And yOu still dOn't get the Message.
HOw Many MOre peOple are yOu

Hello, Lou.

You didn't show for Connie's funeral.
- You were warned about Joey Tai.
YOu clean yOur desk,
yOu're gOing back tO BrOOklyn.
You've been properly served.
I'm sorry, Stash.
You were told to lay off.
If yOu think that l'M gOnna stand

YOu dOn't like it, resign. YOu're thrOugh,

Mercedes. Please.
There are thOse whO liken ChinatOwn
tO a skating pOnd.
on the surface, we see a lOvely landscape
Of snOwflakes and skaters.
But underneath, the cannibal fish: gangs.
The sharks: those who control the gangs.
And the whales: the big bOsses.
All MOve in deadly swarMs.
These bOsses, sOMe are beginning tO say,
are part Of an internatiOnal criMe netwOrk...
...with its headquarters in HOng KOng.
EveryOne denies it, but in the wake Of the...
shOOtings Of JOey Tai
and ROnnie Chang...
...questiOns are MushrOOMing
left and right.
Charges Of illegal wiretapping
have been leveled by H.J. Yung...
...head of the Hun San...
...resulting in the reMOval
Of Captain Stanley White.
one wOnders if this is nOt a sMOke screen
tO distract frOM the Main issue...
...which is what part the Hun San
plays in this Chinese opera.
