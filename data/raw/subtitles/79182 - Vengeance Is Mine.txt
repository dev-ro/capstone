To the Temple
The Temple of Paradise
How old are you, Detective?
Fifty-five.
I'll probably get
the death sentence.
If it takes 'em three years
to hang me, I'll be 40.
No matter how I fight,
I'll never live to your age,
that's for sure.
Fifty-five.
Ten years older than I'll ever be,
and you'll live longer still.
Life sure ain't fair.
A fine refrain from a man
who cut short five innocent lives.
I won't be here anymore,
but you will.
You get to stick around
and get laid.
Would you stop singing, Enokizu!
Come on!
I suppose it's gonna be cold
in the clink.
It's gonna be damn cold
in the clink.

Stand back, stand back!
Move aside! Make way!
Die, Enokizu!
I'll kill you, Enokizu!
Enokizu!
Good morning.
There's nothing good about it!
Just look at my field.
What happened?
It's always the same.
Some drunk Korean wandered in
and fell asleep again.
I'll go take a look. Sorry.
What's she want grated radish
with fish for anyway?
That daughter-in-law of mine
is just so clueless.
He's dead!
And he's not Korean!
He's Japanese!

So you flagged down the truck
at 2:00 p.m. On the 18th.
You're sure about that?
Tanejiro Shibata's
collection bag
contained ¥269,000
at that point in time.
You used this bill to buy a radio
when you were on the run. Look.
There's human blood on it.
Tanejiro Shibata's blood!
We've got hard evidence!
It's no use stonewalling!
Inspector, could you lend me
some nail clippers?
I haven't been convicted yet.
I'd like to maintain good hygiene.
Boy, it just keeps snowing.
Must be three years
since we had snow around New Year's.
January 9th.
He says he had difficulty sleeping
last night due to the cold.
He refused to cooperate all day
in preparing a statement.
He says since we already know his crimes,
we should write it up ourselves.
But it's our job
to extract a confession from him
detailing his 78 days on the run.
OCTOBER 18, 1963
CHIKUHASHI CITY, FUKUOKA
What the hell
are you doing here?
This is Enokizu.
Drives for Saikai Transport.
How many times did we drive together?
- Four or five.
- This here is Daihachi the Rock.
- There you go again.
His real name is Daihachi Baba.
As incorruptible as a rock,
so everybody calls him "the Rock."
I guess that makes
you and him opposites.
Keep that up
and you'll be hoofing it.
Sorry.
How many more stops you got?
- Three.
All in Karita?
That's perfect.
- Why?
Friend of mine runs a hog yard
behind the station.
That's where I'm headed.
Why not stop by with me?
- Drinks?
No way.
I may be nearing retirement,
but I'm still a proud employee
of the great Japan Tobacco and Salt.
What's going on?
Some kind of police incident.
This is Karita.
Search the area thoroughly!
Enokizu!
You think these persimmons are sweet?
If so, I'll take some
as a present for Daihachi.
That straightlaced Daihachi.
He's probably miffed at me
for slipping away to drink on the job.
But who gives a shit?
It'll be all right
if I'm back in half an hour.
Is he still on ahead,
this bootlegger you talked about?
Enokizu!
Goddamn it! What the hell!
Those ain't gonna make
no present.
Where did Shibata go off to?
Look how late it's getting.
He said to tell you
he's red in the face from the drink.
Wants you to wait
another half hour.
It's 4:00 already.
Yeah, so give him 20 minutes.
You can still get back by 5:00.
I'll go see how he's doing.
- How much for this?
- ¥650.
- This one?
- ¥430.
The cheaper one'll do.
You sure
he's drinking way up here?
I don't get it.
It's after 5:00 now.
Stop the truck.
Baba,
I killed Shibata.
Please don't kill me.
I beg you!
My daughter needs me!
I promise I won't tell anyone!
Don't kill me!
Do as I say!
I'll take you to the hospital.
This isn't a hospital!
What are you doing?
I swear I won't say a word.
I'd like this.
Mari? Is the madam in?
She's not?
Where'd she go?
I'll call again later.
A body has been found.
At about 5:00 p.m.
On the 17th,
the badly decayed body
of a woman
was discovered by a housewife
at a cement yard in Kitakyushu.
Is that the damn press again?
Just try and break me!
I ain't talking for no statement!
Have some respect
for a man's life!
This doesn't have to be so hard.
Just tell us
about how you killed Shibata.
Where'd you get the stiletto?
Listen here.
Be sure you get this down right.
Chiyoko Hata gave me the stiletto.
She told me
I should stab him with it.
That's not what she told us.
Did you check her story out
real well?
Here's what
she told us yesterday.
"The stiletto was
to stab him if I had to.
I wanted to break up with him.
If he refused,
I'd settle things with the stiletto. "
This is really
the last time, all right?
You want nori on yours?
You promised last time
that it was the last.
Eat.
Have some pickled radish.
"Delicious rice ball /
Shall we eat another one / A little later"
You and me...
let's go somewhere far away.
I can't live without you.
Let's live together.
And if I refuse?
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you first!
All right, all right!
I said all right!
I went to stab him in the balls,
but he cowered in the corner
and said if I felt that way,
we could break it off.
I didn't waste time
getting out of there.
What happened to the stiletto?
I left it there.
- In the apartment?
- Uh-huh.
The next night
I got a call from him.
The night of the murder?
He wanted me to go to Osaka
with him right away.
And?
I turned him down, of course.
- Why?
- Why?
I'm married, aren't I?
That didn't stop you before.
Besides, I could guess how things
would end up if I went with him.
Hey, they did it.
He trots into position and catches the ball.
The game is over, 2-0.
The Nishitetsu Lions have come
from behind to win the series.
The entire team gathers
on the mound.
Manager Nakanishi is on his way.
Fans pour onto the field.
TRUCK DRIVER SOUGHT
IN MURDER CASE
The sea sure is dark.
We must be about halfway
between Shikoku and Honshu.
If you jumped in here,
I bet they'd never find you.
I don't suppose they would.
Dear Mom and Dad, Kazuko,
Hiroko and Aiko,
forgive my untimely departure
from this life.
Sorry for all the trouble I've been.
I'm too choked up
to write any more.
Remember me for the fool I was,
and forgive me. Best wishes to all.
Aboard the Uko ferry,
Iwao.
So, from January
to August of this year,
you lived with Enokizu
in Chikuhashi?
Yes. He worked
for a PR firm in Beppu
and often stopped in at my restaurant
on his way to their Kokura branch.
He gave me these.
Konpira Lounge.
Were you working
as a stripper then?
I was taking a break from it.
I hope you don't mind
my asking...
but did you know
he was married?
Yes, I did.
But he said it was
a marriage of convenience,
for some kind
of religious reason.
He was good to me.
But he couldn't keep
his hands off me,
and since I have
a child to think about,
I got to be a nervous wreck.
I see.
This here...
this is something else
he gave me.
I was the one
who wanted to break it off.
Now I feel like I failed him.
We will soon
be arriving in Matsue.
All right.
If we have any more questions,
we'll come find you again.
I almost forgot.
They found a postcard
addressed to you on the Uko ferry.
Thanks.
"I have reached the final station
on my life's journey
and started down the path
to the next world.
Everyone I see
looks like the police.
I stand frozen
amidst the throng."
Detective!
Why didn't you show me this first?
It's a suicide note!
It's probably bogus.
Take it easy, Sachiko.
Calm down.
Why didn't you show me this first?
GOTO INN
I appreciate your coming
all this way to tell us.
Iwao has been no end of trouble
since he was little,
but I never imagined
he'd murder anyone.
I just don't know what to say.
For our investigation,
we need names of friends
and acquaintances he might turn to.
We'll help in any way we can.
How could this happen?
He was such a gentle child.
How could this happen?
- Kayo!
- How could this happen?
Mother.
Take her to the other room
so she can pray.
An evil spirit
lives in this house.
An evil spirit
lives in this house.
I'm so sorry.
Hello?
- Anyone back there?
- Coming!
We have guests!
Welcome.
Please come in.
Forgive the interruption.
Not at all.
We're sorry to intrude.
Is your wife ill?
Yes. It goes back 20 years.
She's had a weak heart
since when we lived in the Goto Islands,
and Iwao's always been
such a trial to her.
- So you're from Goto?
- Yes.
SUMMER, 1938
So you're Shizuo Enokizu?
Uppity bastard!
You Christians are the only ones
refusing to provide boats.
Nobody disobeys orders
from the military!
We don't mean to refuse.
But...
why should just us Catholics
have to give up all our boats?
It's not fair.
- Save it!
Stand up!
You gonna give us the boats?
Iwao!
Damn Christian!
Lowlife!
Don't!
Stay out of this!
Idiot!
Is that your boy?
Iwao!
Please forgive him.
Cut it out!
- You can have the boats.
- Good.
Now say, "With great pleasure,
I offer our boats
to the emperor."
"With great pleasure..."
"I offer our boats..."
"to the emperor."
Iwao.
Come home.
It's time to eat.
Come on, let's go.
Crap!
Dad's such a weakling!
You shouldn't
say things like that.
He let them have the boats
and apologized.
He got beat.
You're just a little boy.
There's a lot
you don't understand.
I know what I saw!
Let us go
Let us go
With what the navy
gave me for the boats,
I bought an inn in Beppu.
But Iwao's rebelliousness
just kept getting worse,
and he spent the whole war
in a reformatory.
FALL 1946
There's nothing
to worry about, miss.
Everything's gonna be fine.
When he stole
an American jeep,
he was sent to prison
for two years.
We thought he'd settle down
if he had a wife,
so we found someone for him
and arranged a meeting.
KANNAWA HOT SPRINGS, BEPPU
Hello?
Yes?
- I'm looking for Iwao Enokizu.
- Just a minute.
Can I ask who you are?
Kazuko Omura from Fukuoka.
Iwao's getting his hair cut.
He's meeting his prospective bride today.
- Prospective bride?
- Yes.
If it's important,
I can take a message.
That's all right.
It's great to see you.
What's the matter?
You're getting married.
Nah, it's just some broad
that my dad insisted I meet.
Ugly as sin.
No way am I marrying her.
In her picture
she looks like this.
Where are you going?
I want to meet your parents.
Not today.
We're meeting this other woman.
I pray, O Lord...
You idiot!
Bringing her here
the very day you're meeting -
I said I was sorry.
Fact is, I want to marry her,
not that other creep.
If you say I can't
because she's a Buddhist,
I'll get her baptized tomorrow.
All right?
I'll never allow it!
Shizuo!
I don't have anything
against this girl.
But I won't tolerate your attitude!
Excuse me.
I'm...
three months' pregnant.
So, what'll we do
about the other one?
We still gonna have the meeting?
- Don't be a fool!
What's that woman up to?
Maybe she and Enokizu
have it worked out.
Maybe she lets him know
we've got the place staked out
by standing there like that.
Eggs from
the hot springs of hell.
They're real hot.
Don't burn your fingers.
Don't worry, I'll remember
whose is whose.
Business seems
to be doing well, ma'am.
How much
do you make in a day?
- Have one.
- Thanks. Always wanted to try one.
Could you tell us
why you go to the pier every morning?
I don't know myself.
Do you think he'll kill himself?
Who knows?
I guess that would make things
easier for you guys.
Or am I wrong?
Do you need to take him alive
for some reason?
It's got to be tough on you.
I spend every day in hell.
When did you become
a Catholic?
After I got married.
I understand you left him once,
then married him again.
I found out he'd been
lying to me all along.
But Jesus says the worst sin
is to give up hope,
so I thought we should
face our difficulties.
And I have tremendous respect
for my father-in-law.
SPRING 1959
AKAGAWA HOT SPRINGS
Kazuko.
Come back.
Please. I'm begging you.
You shouldn't be slaving
in some backwoods inn.
Please come back to us.
Father.
Iwao's sins are my own.
I won't let him do it again.
Mother, too...
She misses her grandkids.
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
It's such a shame
you're out here in the backwoods.
Come home to Beppu
with Grandpa, okay?
Let's all three of us
beg your mom together
to go back to Beppu.
Father,
it took a lot for me to leave.
I can't just turn around
and go back.
But you and Iwao
are both baptized Catholics.
You know
God doesn't approve of divorce.
Shall I scrub
your back for you?
That's okay.
Please allow me.
Coming all this way
can't have been an easy trip.
It wasn't so bad.
I've been thinking it over.
I think I'll go back
to Beppu after all.
You will?
I'm so glad.
Mother will be glad, too.
And maybe Iwao can -
I'm not going back for Iwao,
or for Mother.
I know.
You want to please God -
Not to please God either.
I'm going back...
for you.
Let's switch.
It's my turn
to scrub your back.
You're tired.
So tired.
Does that hurt?
No.
My hands
are rough from grappling
with fishing nets
and pulling oars
so many years.
It's raining.
You poor thing.
It's cold.
Kazuko...
get right to bed
or you'll catch cold.
KOKURA PRISON, TWO WEEKS LATER
SERVING A 30-MONTH SENTENCE
FOR FRAUD
You look well.
Hey, stand up.
Never mind.
Kazuko was working in Shikoku,
but I brought her home
a couple weeks ago.
We're registering her
as your wife again.
Why can't you mind
your own damn business?
How can you say that?
You vowed before God
to stay together till death do you part.
Suit yourself.
I'll send the papers.
Put your seal on them.
What about Mom?
How's she doing?
Not so good.
Stay out of trouble
and stop giving her grief.
Where's my father-in-law?
He went out.
Said he had a meeting.
I thought the innkeepers' meeting
was tomorrow.
Bring some sake over here.
- One for you?
- Thanks.
I think the big man
was just being discreet.
What do you mean?
He knows
I'm crazy about you.
You mustn't, Mr. Yasuda.
You've had too much.
Come on, Kazuko.
It must be lonely with your husband away.
Have another drink.
Ah, you like it!
Have some more.
No!
Just relax.
You're hurting me.
So long as it's you and not me,
I don't much care.
Stop it!
I won't stop it.
Stop!
Look here.
Your body says
to keep it coming.
Stop it!
Come on, Kazuko.
I have
your father-in-law's approval.
Father.
Let us go
To the Temple of Paradise
SUMMER 1960- RELEASED ON PAROLE
Why didn't you come
straight home?
Congratulations.
Your long ordeal is over.
How's your health, Mom?
Not so good, not so bad.
How about you?
I'm all right.
Just found myself a job.
Really?
A PR company. This time
I'm gonna make an honest living.
Good for you.
Considering you're 36 already.
I asked a fortune teller
about you the other day.
She said you were destined
to stand above others.
Made me happy.
Some spending money.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Don't mention it.
Anytime you want to see me,
I figure I know why.
How's Dad?
Same as always?
Pretty much.
He killed a dog the other day.
Said the dog bit Kazuko,
so he got mad
and went and caught it.
Buried it up to its neck
and poured boiling water
over its head.
Dad did that?
It was Kazuko
who poured the boiling water.
She's so headstrong,
there's no telling
what those two might do.
Welcome home.
It's good to have you back.
How are the kids?
They're fine.
They're at school.
Come here.
Aren't you my wife?
Is something going on?
What's going on?
Nothing.
I was in the joint a long time.
I'd understand if you got lonely
and fell off the straight and narrow.
It's my own fault.
So I won't be mad.
Fess up.
Who was it?
Was it Dad?
How can you even suggest that?
Everyone thinks
there's something between you two.
It's not true.
When you think about it,
it'd be perfectly natural
if something happened.
Would you like that?
If it only happened once, maybe.
What kind of man are you?
You're not in prison anymore.
Give up your sick daydreams.
How exactly does a man of God
make moves on his daughter-in-law?
I'd have liked to see that.
Nothing happened between us.
I swear to God.
Then who was it?
Tell me!
Who was it?
Please forgive me.
It was all my fault.
Tell me!
Come on!
Assistant Stationmaster Yasuda?
I called last night.
Enokizu, from the Goto Inn.
Come with me.
Here's the ¥50,000
you told me to bring.
Please understand.
I had no idea she had a husband.
I'll never do it again -
Of course you won't,
or I'll burn your house down.
But it was your dad's idea.
What?
He practically asked me to.
He definitely approved.
You sure?
What are you doing?
Let go of me!
All aboard!
Did my wife know?
Not at first.
- What did she do when she found out?
- Train is departing!
It's gonna cost you 50,000 more.
I'll get it! I'll get it!
How low can you get?
What kind of father
pimps his son's wife?
What are you talking about?
I never did that.
- Can you say that in front of Yasuda?
- Of course.
I felt sorry for Kazuko
and happened
to mention it to Yasuda.
That's where you went too far!
Did you ever think about Kazuko?
She was your wife again,
but what did she have to live for?
The neighbors
all knew about you.
She had to protect the kids
from things they said.
She had to play nurse
to your ailing mother
and fill in for her
running the inn.
What's so funny?
We're all blood and can put up
with anything, but Kazuko's from outside.
That's got nothing to do
with what I'm saying.
What about how I feel?
Were you bopping my old man
every night I was in prison?
- Don't be an ass!
- Yasuda told me.
You spread your legs wide
and said "Father."
I never said that.
Don't lie to me!
Lay off her!
Damn it.
You act so pious, while you worship
the mole on your daughter-in-law's ass!
How dare you?
You're no man.
You're an animal.
Come outside.
You lay off Kazuko.
If you really don't believe her,
then take this ax to my head.
Here.
Do it!
You're my own son,
but I can't stand you.
Come on!
You gonna swing that
at your husband?
How much more
do you intend to make us suffer?
I wasn't born yesterday.
I see what's going on.
So you can stop
your playacting.
A guy I was with in prison
was doing his wife and her mother
at the same time.
Iwao!
I hope I'm born a woman
in my next life,
so I can be a bride
in this house.
OCTOBER 26- ENOKIZU SURFACES
AT A RESTAURANT IN OKAYAMA
NOVEMBER 18
ENOKIZU SWINDLES
¥80,000 IN HIROSHIMA
Hamamatsu.
Train for Tokyo
arriving on track one.
NOVEMBER 23- HAMAMATSU STATION
I'm looking for a quiet inn.
Something small and tucked away.
If I can get a girl, all the better.
- I know just the place.
- Is it far?
- No, it's pretty close.
Up this alley on the right.
ASANO INN
Hello?
There's someone at the door.
Welcome.
The driver said this was the best inn
around for letting my hair down.
- Must have been Nemoto Taxi.
- I'll carry it.
It's upstairs.
This way.
Sounds like another guest
has a bad cold.
That's my mother.
She's been in bed for three days.
- Let me do that.
- That's all right.
Much obliged.
I need you
to fill out the register.
Please fill it out yourself.
I'm afraid it's required.
I'm no good
at writing characters.
I teach microanalytic chemistry
at Kyoto University.
Equations are no trouble, but I can't
remember how to write my own name.
Kyoto University
is one of the national schools, right?
Would you find it strange
if a university professor
asked you to find him
some female companionship?
No, I'll send
for someone right away.
What would be your type,
Professor?
Fujiko Yamamoto.
No, Gina Lollabrigida.
"Even the scholar / Hard in pursuit of
knowledge / Wants a woman's touch."
Please pay the girl directly.
It'll be four bills.
All right.
Excuse me, then.
"When you're on the run / It's not a small
sum to pay / This four thousand yen"
Mother?
Shall I call Dr. Kadokura?
I hate doctors.
Not again, Professor.
You're insatiable.
I feel like someone's watching us.
The granny here
has that reputation.
The crone with the cold?
I thought she was in bed
with a raging fever.
I didn't wash my hands
after mah-jongg.
That's disgusting, Jun.
Could you lend me ¥100,000?
I'm tired of managing
a coffee shop.
I'm gonna subcontract
for Yamaha.
No way. Last time I loaned you money,
you blew it at the races.
Who told you that?
That damn Matsunaga.
Come on. Just ¥50,000, then.
Please.
I like this spot right here.
Stop it, Jun!
It's not the money
I'm worried about.
Get over your cold first.
Then you can go
to the boat races.
I'm already over my cold.
Unlike you, I don't have mah-jongg
and men to fool around with.
At least let me go to the races,
you cheapskate!
Ignore them.
They fight all the time.
See, you're still
coughing up phlegm.
So what if I am?
Is this any way
to treat your mother?
Stop acting so high and mighty!
You're just a kept woman!
Drop dead!
Calm down, Grandma!
With a cough like that,
you need to take it easy.
I'm so sorry.
We must have woken you up.
No, I was already up.
- She gets like this all the time.
- I'll teach you -
Now, now, Grandma.
Did I hear something
about boat races?
Here, take this and go.
Blow some money.
It'll blow your cold away too.
You mustn't, Professor.
You'll spoil her.
It's all right.
I have a mother in Kyoto too,
so I seldom get to do
anything nice for her.
Well, I need to get
to the university.
If you get a call
from a Professor Tomita,
please tell him
I'm on my way.
- Good morning.
- You're taking your time this morning.
The professor
kept me up all night.
Asano Inn.
The professor left some time ago
for your office.
Really?
That's very odd.
Oh, here he is now.
Let me put him on.
Ma'am, I missed a train
and had to wait for the next.
I'll take some butter
and corned beef.
When will you learn
to keep proper books?
You're real slick
with the secret accounts.
You said
to keep two sets of books.
There's a limit to what you can
get away with, dummy.
You had that young fellow here again
last night for mah-jongg.
You can't expect me
to play mah-jongg by myself.
There were
three young fellows here.
Welcome back.
I'll be right up with some tea.
Is that guy
staying several nights?
He's a university professor
from Kyoto.
Looks more like an assistant manager
for a textile company.
- You still got a thing going with that boy?
- You have such an imagination.
Don't give me that.
I had Wakasa check up on you.
Isn't that nice.
Look who's talking.
You get yourself a new woman
and take out a new mortgage
on this house without a word to me.
I hear you're financing
a bar for your new squeeze.
The man from the bank
told me everything.
Dumb ass.
After 16 years,
you should know how I operate.
An eye for an eye.
You promised
you'd pay off the mortgage
by the end of the year
and transfer the house
into my name.
First I have to fire some people
and dish out their severance pay.
You promised.
You have to.
The Olympics should help
the economy...
but there's no telling
if we'll see the benefits in textiles.
You have to keep your promise.
I'm getting a cramp in my foot.
Don't worry, I promise.
Professor,
I wish you'd tell my daughter
she should break up
with that young fellow.
I'm just passing through.
It's not my place.
But you're a university professor.
She'll listen to you.
That man of hers
still loves her.
If she got rid of that young fellow,
it'd be for the best.
Her sugar daddy
would keep paying her like always.
How's the inn doing
these days?
So-so.
I bet Miss Haru's got
a tidy sum stashed away.
I doubt that.
She's not all that clever.
I wouldn't mind if she were
cheating on him with you.
Please talk to her.
Good luck at the races.
I hope you win big.
I'm back.
Welcome back.
You drinking?
Will you join me, Professor?
Sure.
Please come in.
- Here's a little something.
- What is it?
It was supposed to be
some books,
but it might have
turned into something else.
It's a present.
Thank you.
You're so sweet.
Have some.
Too bad all men
aren't as thoughtful as you.
That's rather bold.
The sake?
No, you.
Maybe so, huh?
And the professor away from his wife
asks for a call girl every night.
I wouldn't have to
if you'd come to me.
No, no, hands off.
I don't trust men anymore.
Good evening. Mrs. Asano?
- Shall I get it?
- No, I will.
Sit down. I can get it.
You must be Mr. Asano.
I'd like you to put up
one of these "wanted" posters.
All right.
Have you noticed anything unusual
about any of your guests?
Nothing in particular.
If you do, please call us.
Sorry to disturb you.
We appreciate your trouble.
Was it a policeman?
Yeah. He gave me
a poster to put up.
Never mind that.
Let's drink some more.
Come on.
What took you so long?
I called the club ages ago.
How long does it take
from there to here?
I'm sorry.
It's that professor again, right?
He said he'd be here a week.
Sure is nice of him
to call me again.
Nope. Your customer
is the one in the bath right now.
Oh.
Where's Mrs. Asano?
In bed with a stomachache.
Oh, this medicine I have
works great for that.
Never mind.
She's actually with the professor.
The professor?
I see.
What are you looking at?
I travel a lot,
so I like to look at maps.
There's still a lot of places
I haven't been to.
I find it reassuring.
Small as Japan is, it's still a big place.
It's the opposite of you.
What do you mean?
You're tighter than I'd expect.
I can tell you haven't had kids.
You're such a letch, Professor.
Well, my lectures at the university
are finished,
so I have to get back to Kyoto.
What's your wife like?
Just an ordinary woman.
My parents chose her without my say.
Your mother's
an interesting woman.
Interesting?
I'd just say "different."
No, really.
She must have been through a lot.
She's certainly not ordinary.
There's something very unusual about her.
I guess that's why
you're a university professor.
You're a good judge
of character.
You think so?
This isn't exactly a secret,
but she killed someone once.
Killed someone?
The year the war ended,
she was being starved
and bullied.
DECEMBER 3-
IWAO ENOKIZU SPOTTED IN FUKUSHIMA
DECEMBER 8-
IWAO ENOKIZU SCAMS
¥22,000 IN HOKKAIDO
DECEMBER 12-
CHIBA DISTRICT COURT
Will the defendant please step forward.
Do you understand the charges
the prosecutor just read?
Then let me ask this.
To the charge that you stole
¥50,000 cash
from the Matsushita household
at 2-14, Minato-machi, Chiba,
how do you respond?
Say it's not true, Tsutomu!
The other guy made you do it!
Say something, Miss Wakita.
You must be quiet.
The defendant may be seated.
Will the prosecutor
please present the evidence.
Tsutomu will be released on bail
at 2:00 p.m.
I'm sorry.
I don't believe I know you.
Miss Wakita of the probation office?
I've heard a lot about you.
My name is Aihara.
I'm a lawyer specializing in bail matters.
Tsutomu's attorney, Mr. Kubota,
asked me to arrange his release.
Have we met before?
One can't belong to the Chiba legal circle
and not know you, Miss Wakita.
You flatter me!
There's Mr. Kubota now.
Has bail been set?
Not yet, but very shortly.
You needn't worry.
I appreciate your help.
How much
were you able to bring?
¥100,000.
May I ask where you studied,
Mr. Aihara?
Tokyo University.
My father was a judge
in the Tokyo High Court.
I wanted to go to Waseda University
and become a journalist,
but he made me study law
at Tokyo University.
- So you're one of the elite.
- Not at all.
About the bail amount -
With ¥100,000 you should be fine.
I'll try to bring them down.
Thank you.
Oh, before he's released,
it'd be good to pay
Tsutomu a visit.
Remind him how important it is
to adhere to the conditions of his release
and how much trouble it was
for his mother to raise bail.
- That's a good idea.
- Thanks for lunch.
Did Miss Wakita go
to see Tsutomu?
I just called the courthouse.
Let's step in here.
We'll know the bail amount
in five minutes or so.
I'll go pay it for you.
At that point a release form
will be issued,
and Tsutomu will be out in no time,
so you can just wait here.
Now, if you'd give me
the money.
Thank you so much.
Here it is.
I appreciate all your help.
I'll take care of it.
- Chiba station.
- Wait!
I was waiting first.
- Where are you going?
- The station.
We'll share then.
Please hurry.
What a stroke of luck,
meeting an attorney like this.
A meeting ordained by fate.
When it comes to buying property,
I'm on unfamiliar ground.
And with the seller in prison,
it makes things even worse.
Which bar association
do you belong to?
The Second Bar Association.
Where do you live?
In Zoshigaya, near Ikebukuro.
I live alone in an old apartment
and do as I please.
It can't be easy living alone.
I'm used to it.
Would you care to stop for sukiyaki?
I'd like to ask you some questions.
Sir!
My shoes!
Weren't you staying until noon, sir?
The call girl never came.
If she's not coming,
you could at least tell me. My shoes!
- Didn't you stay up, Mother?
- Shoehorn!
I guess I nodded off.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I thought the girl was with you.
How much for an overnight?
It's normally ¥2,000,
but 1,000 will do.
I'm so sorry.
I phoned the club more than once.
Why didn't she come?
You shouldn't have fallen asleep!
I was tired.
From the boat races?
Hello? Club Shiragiku?
This is the Asano Inn.
Why didn't your girl come last night?
We left the door open.
I hate to say this,
but the girls all say
they're scared of your mother.
And she peeps.
The three men are Iwao Enokizu,
Kenzo Nishihara...
Hey, that's the professor.
What professor?
The guy at the Asano Inn
a couple weeks ago.
He was all over me
all night long.
It probably just looks like him.
I don't know.
He's the spitting image.
If it's really him,
maybe the police will give you a reward.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
The police don't exactly
approve of our business.
That's true.
He was seen on October 26
at a restaurant in Okayama...
What can I get you, sir?
- This sukiyaki beef.
- How much would you like?
- 400 grams.
- 400 grams. Thank you, sir.
Can I help you, sir?
I'd like this.
And 30 short nails.
- Do you have some tape?
- Yes.
DECEMBER 15- ZOSHIGAYA, TOKYO
Sure does get messy lately.
It's because we have
so many more customers.
Everybody wants to see
where Iwao grew up.
People like to gawk
at others' misery.
Tongues are wagging about us sending
Mom to the hospital, too.
She's sick.
What else could we do?
She may not even make it
to the new year.
Then we can finally be together,
you and me.
You know they'll hang Iwao
if they catch him.
Watch your tongue.
You shouldn't say things like that.
I shouldn't speak plainly now,
but later it'll be okay?
Father!
Once things quiet down,
change your name and remarry.
Find someone who'll take
your children in too.
- I'm supposed to leave you all alone?
- There's no other choice.
How will you get by?
I'm ready for the old folks' home.
I'll sit there drooling in the sun.
Once or twice a year,
you can bring the kids to see me.
I'll come every day.
I'll lick the drool
clean from your lips.
The phone's ringing.
The Goto Inn.
Hello?
Damn it!
Hey, Gramps.
"The can opener / Where could you
have hidden it / Enlighten me please"
Come on in.
I brought a guest today.
Hey, Grandma,
she wants to take a bath.
This way, please, miss.
You know that young fellow,
Jun something-or-other?
I hear he's in Kagoshima.
- Kagoshima?
He got married three days ago.
He's on his honeymoon.
I don't believe you.
I had Wakasugi tail him.
The bride's from a good family
in the textile industry.
Didn't he say anything?
He's a world-class jerk,
but you were pretty stupid, too.
That's right. I'm stupid.
This auction notice came
for this house.
I may be stupid, but this is too much.
You broke your promise.
I have a lot of employees
to take care of.
I have to do a lot of juggling.
You always have
some phony answer.
I'll make good on it
before it comes to auction.
Stop whining like a baby
all the time.
Registered letter for Haru Asano.
Coming.
Mr. Ideike,
please don't abandon Haru.
After all, you're the one
who made her a real woman,
and when all's said and done,
she still loves you.
Please be good to her.
Here's your pay for peeping.
It's a naughty little thing
you taught me.
My, that's a very fine kimono.
Is it Oshima silk?
It's wool, dummy.
That girl may be young,
but her boobs sag.
I think flaunting her like this
is actually a sign
that he really cares
about you.
Mother,
the professor sent me
some money.
"I'm visiting a university in Tokyo.
We scholars are poor,
so I can't send much,
but please enjoy
some sake with this."
He certainly is
a kindhearted man.
The Asano Inn.
Professor!
I just got your letter.
Where are you calling from?
Ikebukuro? In Tokyo?
Will you take me
somewhere far away?
Why won't you answer?
The Temple of Paradise
Where's that song from?
The islands.
What islands?
I really don't know
much about you, do I?
Actually, when I think about it,
I don't know a thing.
And you know nothing
about me either.
But that's all right.
Two strangers,
like animals.
Animals...
Let's see this one.
Are you hungry?
This was John-John's third birthday.
He was prompted by his mother
to say his final farewell to his father
with a salute, bringing tears to every eye.
At Mrs. Kennedy's request,
the funeral procession
followed the form of President Lincoln's.
The route was lined
with 250,000 mourners.
And so the United States'
young and idealistic leader
was mourned by people
all over the world
and laid to rest
in Arlington National Cemetery.

ANYONE WITH INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS MAN
IS ASKED
TO CONTACT THE POLICE
LIBERATION, PART 3
THE GREAT SIEGE
Shall we die together,
Professor?
I'm serious.
I don't want
to drag you into this.
You were deceiving me.
I feel bad about that.
ENOKIZU'S WHEREABOUTS
STILL UNKNOWN
Haru,
what are you doing?
Fixing this.
Back from the races?
I could hardly leave the place empty
with you away.
Where were you?
Tokyo.
Why did you go there?
To see the professor.
The one who stayed here?
Uh-huh.
That man's a murderer.
There's a nationwide manhunt on.
You knew?
You knew and you still?
Where did you leave him?
He's here. Upstairs.
I'm not that hungry.
Once you lose your appetite,
you're finished.
Won't be long
before they get you.
Why'd you come back here?
Are you going to drag us into this
and mess up our lives?
Mother.
Get out!
I was in prison myself
until just a while ago.
After 15 years in the joint,
I finally get to lead
a normal life again.
I don't want anything to do
with cops or murderers.
Just when I thought I could
finally lead a respectable life.
A respectable life?
Those 15 years -
what do you think
I was doing all that time?
After what you did,
I had to quit the textile company.
Had to practically go into hiding.
I felt like I could hardly breathe.
You turned my whole life
upside down.
Until then, I was like any other girl.
I had dreams.
Now I'm a kept woman
and a procuress.
You call that a respectable life?
Haru!
And you're still messing
things up for me.
Lately the girls don't show up,
so customers don't come either,
and it's all because of you.
The call girls refuse
to come here...
because they all say
you give them the willies.
Did you know that?
I'll go.
Yeah, I'll go.
- Then I'm going with you.
- Why would you do that?
It's destiny.
Right, Professor?
He's no professor.
He's Iwao Enokizu.
Makes no difference to me.
Take me to Okinawa
or Taiwan or wherever.
You could get yourself killed.
I don't care.
What have I got
to live for anyway?
No.
I'll leave.
Shouldn't you go after her?
She'll come right back.
You think so?
What if she goes to the police?
Oh, no! What'll we do?
What the hell.
If she does, she does.
But -
What the hell.
Are you hungry?
I brought you
some sweet bean cakes.
How am I supposed to win
with a jinx like you next to me?
You put on sunglasses and come
right out in the open. You've got nerve.
You invited me.
I was afraid you and Haru
might skip out while I'm here.
What's your call
on the next race?
How about 3-4 or 3-6?
It's a bad day for the threes.
They've wiped me out.
How about a little loan?
Maybe you should pawn your ring.
You better treat me nice
or I'll call the cops.
Go ahead. Try it.
Here. Pick the ones I said.
I think I've got it.
Since the hard-luck man is stuck on them,
I'll avoid the threes like the plague.
I won ¥60,000!
Keep it.
No.
You take this money
and disappear.
I won't tell anyone.
You can have it all.
It's not about the money.
Don't try to kill me, Enokizu.
That's what you wanna do,
isn't it?
Ever since
you walked out last night.
So this is the second time?
And the third time's the charm?
Wipe that smirk off your face.
I suppose you think we're alike
as fellow killers?
Not really.
But I sort of feel like
you're a prison buddy.
Well, give it up.
This isn't prison.
It's the big wide world.
And it sure has changed.
No kidding.
The whole world's gone crazy.
But you know,
when I killed that old battle-ax,
I really wanted to.
So I felt great after I did it.
Is that how you feel right now?
No.
So you haven't yet killed
who you really want to kill?
Maybe not.
Then you're a wimp.
They'll hang you for sure.
What's going on?
Your mother
phoned me last night.
Pleaded with me
to make up with you.
You shouldn't make her worry so.
Did you come
just to tell me that?
I found some money
and paid off the mortgage on this place.
Satisfied?
That girl ran out on you,
didn't she?
Same old story.
I'm back.
Oh, Mr. Ideike.
Set your little girl straight!
It doesn't help a guy's reputation
to look after the daughter of a murderer!
I've put up
with a lot over the years!
Damn it!
And I'm looking after
the ex-con mother to boot!
If it weren't for me,
you'd both be beggars!
Fine talk from the brute
who sleeps in a beggar's bed.
What?
Goddamn it!
You...
Fucking asshole!
Who gives a shit?
You can't treat me this way!
Watch this, you old hag!
I'll screw her
right in front of you!
Mother, help!
Help!
- Shut up!
Give it up, bitch!
You know you want it.
Please help!
DECEMBER 20
Here you go.
According to investigators,
the victim, Kyohei Kawashima,
a 68-year-old lawyer,
was found dead
in his ransacked apartment,
and ¥50,000 has been
confirmed missing.
Based on witness accounts,
investigators speculate the killer may be
Iwao Enokizu, already wanted for murder.
Witnesses confirm sightings
of Enokizu in the Ikebukuro area.
He says he has a fever.
Oh?
When all's said and done,
Mr. Ideike just can't live without you.
Men and women get that way
when they've been together -
- Oh, shut up.
- No, I won't.
You're a grown woman.
You know you'd never get far with him.
His picture's plastered everywhere,
and all over TV.
The cops aren't stupid, you know.
Do you really intend
to run off with him anyway?
If I do, what will you do?
Well...
I really don't know.
I don't have anywhere to go.
I suppose I'll die
in the gutter somewhere.
Tomorrow's the 33rd memorial
for your father, you know.
Oh, that's right.
The other day,
I killed another man in Tokyo.
I know.
What'll you do...
if I die?
If they catch me
and hang me?
I'm not dying with you.
There's no way
I'm dying with you.
I want a child.
I want to have your child.
I could never get pregnant before,
but I will with you. I know it.
Haru.
I want a baby.
I will. I'm sure of it.
I want a baby.
I didn't know you were up.
Are you hungry? I'll fix lunch.
Where's your mom?
Visiting my dad's grave.
In about four or five days,
you'll get to enjoy
some very tasty
cayenne and garlic pickles.
Four or five days?
Sounds good.
My family used to be farmers.
We always had
lots of pickles.
So you still make them
every year?
You'll have to make them next year
and the year after that, too.
Every year, even after I die.
Can I have some too?
That glass is fine.
Tilt it for me.
That was good!
Give me some more.
Somewhere far away...
Thank you.
Marufuku Pawn Shop.
Next to Ushiyama Park?
The Asano Inn. All right.
Honey! We have a customer.
He needs cash and wants to pawn
some kimonos and furniture.
Where is it?
An inn next to the park.
I'll run right over in the truck.
Tell him I'll be there at 6:00.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm back.
Why don't you turn on a light?
Huh?
What's all this?
Where's Haru?
She wasn't feeling well.
She's upstairs in bed.
Hello! It's the sushi man!
- Here you are.
- Who ordered this?
The missus, I guess.
Premium sushi for three.
Say, Granny,
I heard you won big at the races.
It wasn't all that much.
Thank you!
I suppose
I should take one upstairs.
Kayo!
What are you doing
out of the hospital?
If I'm going to die,
I want to die at home.
- You shouldn't be doing this.
- You should be in bed.
I won't die yet.
I can't die yet. Hi, Aiko.
- You the pawnbroker?
- Yes. Marufuku.
Just up this way.
Turn here.
I'm a woman, too.
I won't give you up to Kazuko.
You shouldn't
say things like that!
Go away.
How about
the TV and refrigerator?
Not unless
they're brand new, sir.
Thanks.
I could lend you ¥100,000
for the phone
after I make sure tomorrow that
the line rights can be transferred.
We'll go together.
Have some sushi.
Thank you.
What I'm taking today
comes to ¥46,000.
¥4,000 more
would make it even.
Did you bring your seal?
MARUFUKU PAWN SHOP
Can I help you?
It's nothing.
Officer!
I suppose I get transferred
to Kokura tomorrow.
Take care of yourself.
At least until I get
the noose, huh?
After all this time,
I still don't get why you killed
those two women in Hamamatsu.
I don't suppose you do.
Can't say I really
understand it myself.
It was actually
three I did there.
Three?
Someone besides
the mother and daughter?
The woman was pregnant
with my child.
I'm positive she was.
She was positive too.
A tiny little me
was starting to take shape
in her womb.
KOKURA PRISON VISITING ROOM
I saw a magazine article you wrote,
with a picture of you and Kazuko.
Some drivel about
how you blame yourself.
You should forget that shit.
You've got nothing
to do with me.
I went to see the priest today.
You're being excommunicated.
It's about time!
So I can't bury you
in the family plot.
Yesterday...
your mother passed away.
But now when you die,
I can't bury you
next to your mother.
Forget it.
Just throw my bones
in some dump.
Is that all you have to say?
I'll never forgive you.
Who asked you to?
But I know
God won't forgive me either.
Your blood is my blood.
The blood of the devil
is in my veins too.
I wished you and your mother
would hurry up and die.
From my longing to sleep
with Kazuko, I wished for it -
As if you haven't already.
No...
I wrestled those animal impulses
to the ground.
I can't betray God.
You're so full of it.
To atone for that...
I asked the priest
to excommunicate me too.
I won't be buried
in the family plot either.
- What'll you do when you die?
- I don't know.
Iwao...
you've got to fear God,
even after you're excommunicated.
I don't need God.
I killed innocent people,
so I'll be put to death.
That's how it should be.
Can't be any other way.
Then why did you run
for so long?
I wanted to be free
as long as I could.
Now go home.
The visit's over.
Iwao.
Father and son,
connected by blood -
is this all it amounts to
in the end?
That's right. We'll always be separate,
even after we die.
You say
you'll never forgive me.
But I won't forgive you either.
If I was going to kill anybody,
I should have killed you.
You couldn't kill me.
You're not the kind
who could kill his own father.
You saying
I'm not man enough?
You can only kill those
who never harmed you.
Damn you.
Even now...
I wish I could kill you.
FIVE YEARS LATER
I got a letter from the warden.
He said Iwao went
to the gallows unafraid.
He died bravely.
I got a letter too.
From Iwao.
He said I'd better not find another man,
even after he dies.
It's so like him.
Still, I think you should seriously consider
that proposal from Chikuzen-ya.
Change your name
so you can remarry and -
That's why you asked Aiko...
not to abandon you?
- I never said that.
- Sure you did. You asked Hiroko too.
Nothing good can come
from you staying on with me.
After all, I'm an Enokizu.
Iwao used to say
you were dishonest.
I think he's right.
Maybe so.
But -
That's what I like about you.
You try.
Let us go
To the Temple of Paradise
Let us go
Here.
Go ye ahead along the path
To show us the way
