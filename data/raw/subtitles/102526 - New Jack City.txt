I just been doing a little
experimentation-type thing.
A little experimentation-type thing.
Like what?
At the clubs, guys step away
from the blackjack table or the bar...
...to buy $50 or $100 worth of sniff.
I set them up with a hit
of the base.
Fifteen minutes after leaving,
they be back with 2 and 3 people.
So what?
They ain't come back for the cocaine.
They came back for the base.
You sound like
this shit'll change the world.
I don't know about all that

And the bitches...
Oh, Lord! Them bitches!

Who?
Good. Because you got to rob

They running a strange program.
More poor and disenfranchised folks
than this place has ever seen.
They try to act like it don't exist.
- Meanwhile, the rich get richer--
- And the poor get nothing.
NINO: Times like these, people want
to get high. Real high and real fast.
And this is gonna do it.
And make us rich.
I mean, what?
People going crazy over this?
It look like cracked-off
pieces of soap.
NINO: The Colombians and Dominicans
have shown us the way.
The shit is large.
But we'll do it differently.
No more selling on street corners.
Change the product,
you change the marketing strategy.
I've seen the future.

They become loyal customers.
If they don't, it's like Beirut.
They become live-in hostages.
We gonna set up a lab here,

You hook up the computer, watch the

...to make a positive impact
on our nation.
OLD MAN:
Sergeant, I'm talking to you.
I want to know how drug pushers can
take over an apartment building...
...right under your noses.
If you lived in The Carter Apartments,
there'd be cops all over the place.
Hey, don't walk away. Listen to me!
I fought for this country. We pay taxes
and we're prisoners in our home.
Excuse me, excuse me.
I told the commissioner
you were running late.
STONE: You got those files?
PARK: Right here.
- Let's hope he buys it.
- All right.
COMMISSIONER: Peretti and Appleton?
No way, Stone.
Who else you got?
STONE: They're the ones I need.
COMISSIONER: You kidding?
Nick Peretti almost killed
his partner.
- Scotty Appleton's on suspension.
- Probation.
Semantics, Stone.
These two are trouble.
You and I know the system
wasn't ready for this epidemic.
Crack came on the scene
and spread like wildfire.
Now I got the mayor
and the governor on my back.
I need some results.
Fasﬂ
You get me Nino Brown!
Forget Peretti and Appleton.
The risk is too high.
With all due respect, sir...
...you still don't get it.
You're not giving me what I need
to win this war:
Cops that know these streets.
I need new jack cops
for a new jack gangster.
What you call a risk,
I think is our only shot.
Let's go.
Stone!
Okay.
You got your men.
But I don't want any waves.
Not a goddamn ripple.
SCOTTY: Who the hell is this
psychedelic, blotter-acid fool?
Be cool.
This is Detective Nick Peretti,
a motorcycle-freak, reject cop like you.
A wild man that no one wants.
He means I'm expendable.
Whatever, man. What did you
come here for? To watch me exercise?
I came here to lay a name on you.
Nino Brown?
His sidekick,
Gerald "Gee Money" Wells?
- The Cash Money Brothers.
STONE: Stuck up two-bit jewelry stores.
Yeah, thrill-seekers, wannabe
gangsters. I hate them. So, what's up?
What's up is this:
We need some evidence.
Evidence of murder,
drug trafficking...
...racketeering, tax evasion.
Anything.
We've never been able
to make anything stick on Brown.
SCOTTY: No shit. One-third of
the department's on Nino's payroll.
Other two-thirds don't care
unless it affects their community.
What you saying?
Listen.
I've been authorized to set up...
...an independent drug-fighting unit
and I'm picking you.
SCOTTY: Why me?
STONE: What do you mean?
You're from the neighborhood.
I can trust you.
And I know you give a shit.
So, what's the catch?
There's no catch.
Why you got to say that?
- Because I know your ass, Stone.
- Peretti goes with you.
This big, biscuit-head looking--
STONE: Listen! It won't be another
one of your wild-ass solo acts.
Peretti's the only cop I could find
crazy enough to team with you.
STONE:
This is my shot.
And you fuck up, it's all on me.
I want to thank you because you know
I want to get back in this war.
But this guy, man...
You in or out?
I'm in, all right?
NINO: What do you mean,
Frazier won't give up the apartments?
I'm not asking him, I'm telling him!
I'll handle that fat bastard myself.
NINO: We're honored.
FRANKIE: No, I'm honored. Really.
We understand you have
a new Peruvian connection.
NINO:
So, what of it?
We know you're centralizing
operations at The Carter.
And you didn't notify Don Armeteo,
who takes such things as an insult.
- Your point?
- My point is...
...you fucking guys are cutting us out
of our agreed upon 10 percent.
FRANKIE:
It's time we renegotiate.
I tell you what, message boy.
You go back and tell Don Armeteo:
"No renegotiating." Fuck that!
The Cash Money Brothers
are a self-contained unit now.
But you come see me next week.
And I'll hook you up with some
collard green linguinis and shit.

Maybe get a better suit!

He don't even deny it.
Nor does he accept
our partnership no more.

somebody cares about the needy.
Why don't you give me a turkey?
Look at your funky, black ass.
First you want to be a stickup kid.
But then you got shot.
Now you's a basehead.
You're messed up.
Your life is crap.
I know I look like stir-fried shit.
Hook me up with some food.

There's a line. You got to wait.
Give him something to eat.
Hook me up.

This all I get?
You want more?
I'm a veteran.
NINO:
Here. How's that, all right?
Clean yourself up,
maybe I'll give you a job.
All right, man.
Want to buy a turkey?
SCOTTY:
I'm keeping an eye on him.
POOKIE: You don't deserve that turkey.
I hooked you up for that last get-high.
Why I got to be owing you?
I was prom queen of King High School.
This is beneath me.
You used to be prom queen, now you're
the prom fiend. Look at you!
Hey what?! Didn't I hook you up?
Didn't I get that pipe from the Iranian
who tried to beat me out of $5?
Didn't I speak to your mother after
she called me a homeless bastard?
Add all that up...
...and the fact that I can beat
your ass. I say it's my turkey!
PROM QUEEN: Get away!
Get the fuck away!
Stop beating on her!
Stop it!
POOKIE:
Let go of me, man.

You're a poor excuse for a brother.

It's a cop! It's a cop!
SCOTTY:
Shut up!
Shut up or I'll blow your brains out.
Don't hurt me.
- Shut up!
- I know I was wrong to beat that girl.
Crack has got me.
I got no control over it.
I tried to kick...
...but the shit be calling me.
It calling me. I got to go to it.
- I need help, man.
- Come on, man.

- They'll hook you up.
- I'm gonna die!

I had pretty much
everything I ever wanted.
Everything I thought I wanted.
I always had a need for acceptance.
All my friends were doing it.
Thought I could quit anytime.
That's when I woke up in the hospital.
COUNSELOR:
It's a very simple program.
We only ask that you don't use
or drink, one day at a time.
Don't leave before the miracle happens.
This program has revolving doors.
But just because you go out,
don't mean you can come back in.
It's crazy, because...
...I did everything. I whored.
I ripped my family off.
I was so scandalous,
I would even sell my baby's Pampers.
I have a crack baby.
He was born blind.
I know why he's blind.
Everybody knows why he's blind.
I kept telling myself I was
gonna kick, but I never did.
I'm a junkie.
I'll be a junkie the rest of my life.
POOKIE: It's the first time
I've been away for so long...
...and personally, I hope I never see
you motherfuckers again.
When I get out, I'll just take
everything one day at a time.

It's not just a job.
You saved my life.

I'll take his money...
-...and report to you.
- I don't know.

if I stay on the streets.
I need to be a part of something.
If you don't believe in me, who will?

out the operations. Let's get down to business.
All right, Pookie.

Tell me what goes on in this dump.
It took me a while,
but I've been through the whole joint.
First, you got to show
a membership card to this runner.
PERETTI:
It's like a video club.
POOKIE: Nino's got it hooked up
like Mission: Impossible.
Walking through that courtyard's
like a nightmare.
It's a nation full of zombies.
On the 2nd floor, a worker
rings a buzzer and a code.
A little panel on the wall opens up,
you get the crack.
SCOTTY:
The code, the buzzer, where that go?
POOKIE: The call goes to the Drug
Store where they make the crack.
I heard they got everybody in there
butt-naked. Titties hanging. ...
Nino don't trust a motherfucker.
PARK:
Nino's one sick genius.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
What happens at the Drug Store?
You can take your goodies home,
or stay at the Enterprise.
SCOTTY:
What's the Enterprise ?
POOKIE:
What am I, your ghetto tour guide?
They got all this equipment
and you don't know shit.
When you're smoking crack, they say
you're "beaming up to Scotty. "
You're going to another world.
Crack is the "final frontier.
That's why they call that room
the "Enterprise."
People sit down and light that
glass dick and take a hit.
It's scary. Their eyes look like
a rocket, getting ready to blast off.
Nino has most of the apartments?
Man, are you deaf, or what?
The boy controls the whole place.
Nino Brown's a mad scientist.
Marvin said it. "The boy that made
slaves out of men." That's Nino!

I told you before she couldn't
make no babies!
SELINA:
I love you!
And now you're taking me for granted.
How can you do that?
This is corny!
This is soap opera shit!
- You act like I owe you something.
- You do.
I don't owe you jack!
Okay, you did give me
a couple of books to read.
And you helped build the brothers.
But I was your ticket out of boredom.
When your rich doctor daddy was
making house calls at Harlem General.
What's up with that? Right?
When your kleptomaniac mother
was housing shit in Bloomingdales.
Don't throw shit in my face--
You ever touch me again,
I'll--
I wanna sex you up
All night
Girl you make me feel good
I want to
I wanna sex you up
Make sweet lovin all night long
Yeah, I'm aware of that situation.
CHIEF:
Your man hired an ex-dealer.
I know it seems unconventional.
Appleton and Peretti report to me.
- Is it out of control?
- No.
Don't blow this.
- Does the commissioner know about it?
- Not yet.
Good.
I told you about
that new jack cop shit.
I give you a chance, and you hire
a craokhead. What's with you?
Why don't you get off my dick?
When you're ready to put yourself
on the frontline, let me know.
Excuse me. Is this a black thing?
It is, so keep your
toy Mafia-butt out of it!
Fuck the Mafia! I'll wax
your high-yellow, narrow-ass butt!
Cool it!
Relax, all right?
If you won't handle this,
send the white boy...
...inside The Carter with
the National Guard.
What we need is a videotape
of this whole operation.
We need evidence of the
financial records to make it work.
I'm the lookout there from
7 p.m. to 7 a.m...
...in one of the apartment windows.
I had to fill out an application.
Asked if I still got high.
They remember me from before.
I was one of their first customers.
I used to get fucked up.
Cracker barrel, cracker ass.
- I didn't give a fuck what it was.
- I got it, I got it.
Park.
This belt is really a video camera.
These wire transmitters will be
taped to you.
It'll send your
communication to us...
...as well as sounds and images
around you.
It will pick up shit
you can't hear.
PERETTI:
Don't worry, Pookie.
You'll be great.
You're the best man for this job.
You're a fucking genius.
Your mother.
PARK:
Pookie, we're counting on you.
You can help us bring down CMB.
Try this on.
STONE:
You with it?
I'm with it, man.
Let's roll with it.
Put it on.
KAREEM: Pookie, come here, man.
Come here.
You know, I told Gee Money
how good you been.
How you've been bringing in
lots of customers.
And you're just a lookout.
Anything that makes them
more money, they like.
SCOTTY:
This might be it.
We're promoting you.
Check it out.
GEE:
Soon. Let's get going with it.
Jackpot! System!
PARK:
He's inside! Yes!
KAREEM: This kid's been
bringing us business.
POOKIE: I'd like to take a shot
at one of those computer terminals.
- Can you program Pascal?
POOKIE: Can a white man dance?
POOKIE: I guess not.
But people lose interest.
Today's your lucky day, homeboy.
I'm promoting your ass.
SCOTTY: All right!
PERETTII Yeah, right.
GEE:
You still on the pipe?
POOKIE:
No way.
Good. Real good. Because you'll
be working in the Drug Store.
I'm glad you got confidence in me.
KAREEM: See you.
POOKIE: All right.
GEE:
Hold on a second.
- Keep an eye on that kid.
- Why? What's wrong?
He's light-fingered.
Keep an eye on the product.
I don't think Pookie's ready
to be in a room full of crack.
I'm ready. Don't I look ready now?
I was born ready.
PERETTI: Ready to be dead.
SCOTTY: Stay out of this.
He's already on the inside.
With a little more time...
...we'll have enough information
to put Nino away for good.
In my opinion, we get him out--
I don't want your opinion.
I'm against it.
STONE: But it's your call.
PERETTI: And your funeral.
We told them, man.
Ready? Shit.
You better be ready,
because you owe a lot of people.
You owe me. You owe yourself.
You owe the whole community.
You even owe my mother.
Yeah, that's right.
A junkie just like you
killed my mother in 1974.
Didn't take money or jewelry.
Just took her life.
I don't know what you got left
in your so-called rehabilitated body.
But you better find something,
because you owe a lot of people.
A lot of people. You owe, Pook.
POOKIE: You got skim milk
in them titties?
One and a-two and a-three
and a-four...
I'll give you something
to look at.
PERETTI: Superfly, there's something
wrong with your boy.
PARK:
What's happening with Pookie?
SCOTTY:
I have no idea.
PERETTI:
You should, he's your plant.
Cool out. You're jumping the gun.
Something's wrong with your guy.
POOKI E:
Fourscore seven years...
PARK: Is that code for help?
PERETTI: It's a black thing.
SCOTTY: I'm tired of your stuff.
I'm tired of this dude.
GEE:
What's wrong?
POOKIE: Just doing a workout. This is
a tough job. Got to stay in shape.
- This ain't no gym.
- A workout boosts worker morale.
You think I'm stupid.
GEE:
You're a high motherfucker.
You five-0?
- His cover's blown!
PERETTI: Let's go!
GEE:
Are you five-0?!
Take him out and kill him!
And blow the building!
Scotty help me! I'm gonna die!
Let's go!
Let's go!
[SIRENS]
OFFICER:
Freeze! Police!
[GUNSHOTS]
Let me through!
I'll do her!
PERETTI:
Clear!
SCOTTY:
Police! Get out!
Come on!
Shit!
Shit! Nothing here!
Let's get out of here!
Pookie!
[CHILD CRIES]
PERETTI: Come here. Hold on.
Keep your head down.
PERETTI:
Here we go!
PERETTI:
Scotty!
Where the hell are you?
SCOTTY: Shit!
PERETTI: Touch Pookie, it blows.
SCOTTY: Do this.
PERETTI: Too many wires.
SCOTTY:
Pick one.
SCOTTY:
Come on!
I can't see.
Give me a light!
Hold it there.
PERETTI:
Scotty, on three...
...I want you to slowly,
gently pull out the blue wire.
PERETTI:
Slow!
One, two, three!
PERETTI: One is the ground.
SCOTTY: Which?
PERETTI: I don't know!
Three seconds left!
Don't shy away from me, girl
You know I'll never leave you again
Through thick and thin until the end
I'll be here for the rest of your life
I'm still waiting for somebody
[PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
I knew it! You ain't nothing
but a high-priced ho.
Put Nino on, bitch.
It's for you.
Oh, man. Shit!
What's up?
I know you're having a good time,
but we were infiltrated.
We shut down The Carter.
Get your ass here now!
NOW!
S1:Op!
NINO:
What happened?
Don't nobody know nothing?
Don't everybody speak at once.
How the motherfucker get in?
Out of all you motherfuckers,
nobody knows jack shit?
The Duh Duh Man.
Duh Duh, what happened?
Keisha?
I'll be a motherfucker.
Don't nobody know nothing?
What up with this?
Somebody got to know something
was going on.
See what I'm saying?
Ain't that right, Gee Money?
I think Gee Money definitely
knows something.
Gee Money knows something.
You fucked up.
You fucked up bigtime.
You're incapable of running this shit.
Sit your five-dollar ass down,
before I make change.
Kareem brought him to my attention.
We got 300 employees.
I can't keep my eye on all of them.
If you was taking care
of business--
NINO: What? If I was what?
Say it again!
What?!
- Nothing.
- That's what I thought you said!
Because that's what I got, nothing!
A million-dollar-a-week business
reduced to rubbish!
It's your responsibility.
I never liked you anyway,
pretty motherfucker.
What's the matter, Gee?
What's up with you?
You're letting some shit like who
I'm laying the pipe to, fuck with you?
You're bigger than that.
Something like this
can never happen again.
Now...
...leave me.
Nino...
Get the fuck out.
GEE:
What Gee Money has brought together...
...let no man put asunder.
I now pronounce us man...
...and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
PRIEST: Be not deceived.
Neither fornicators, nor idolaters...
...nor adulterers, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind...
...shall inherit the kingdom of God.
May your soul rest in peace.
STONE:
Good bye, Pookie
The commissioner's been on my ass.
Washington is blaming us for losing
thousands of dollars in man-hours.
Not to mention all the cops
we got killed.
The operation was a failure.
We didn't arrest anyone.
No one, man.
We didn't get any evidence. Nothing.
No financial records, nothing.
We still could be out there
fighting scum like Nino Brown...
...except for two things:
I gambled on you,
and you gambled on a crackhead.
SCOTTY:
Fuck that!
PERETTI:
That's enough, man!
I'm sorry you lost your budget.
But I lost a friend.
Scotty...
Let it go. Operation's over.
It's over.
It ain't over.
Pookie didn't die for nothing.
SCOTTY:
Operation's gone...
...Nino's loose, Pookie is dead.
I got Pookie killed.
PERETTI: Cut out this self-pitying shit
about you killing Pookie.
If anyone killed him, it was me.
I could see it.
How you gonna tell me
you killed Pookie?
Remember when you said
I didn't care?
When what the hell was I doing
at Pookie's funeral anyway? Remember?
I used to be Pookie.
How the hell you used to be Pookie?
I was a poor white trash Pookie.
This whole drug shit, it's not
a black thing, it's not a white thing.
It's a death thing.
Death doesn't give a shit about color.
You don't have to like me.
I don't even know if I like you.
But we're in this together now.
You know, a drug dealer
is the worst kind of brother.
He won't sell it to his sister
or his mother.
But he'll sell it
to his boys in the street.
I don't know about you...
...but I'm ready to kill Nino Brown.
Are you with me?
I'm ahead of you.
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING
OVER CLUB SPEAKERS]
PERETTI: Behind door number one,
your head explodes like a melon.
SCOTTY: Behind two, you hook us up
with Gee Money...
...and get the prize, Nino Brown.
FRANKIE:
Let's make a deal.
FRANKIE:
We always had an understanding.
Besides, I needed a haircut.
[FRANKIE & PERETTI
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
My cugino and his friend
are hungry.
And I got a feeling
they'll out you a sweeter deal...
...than any Peruvian.
Enough to maybe throw in
a finder's fee for me.
If I swim with this--
You wanted to meet the main man.
From now on, you deal with me...
...and me only.
You will cut me a side deal.
Twenty percent.
And you will be obligated
to report to me...
...and me only.
Give me your number.
Oh, yeah.
Don Armeteo.
Nino is about to itch.
GEE: What the fuck is up?
NINO: What's up? Play ball!
NINO:
Check!
KEISHA:
Can I help you?
SCOTTY:
I'm here to see Gee Money.
GEE: What's up with these elbows?
NINO: Sucker!
KEISHA:
I don't know you. Yo, Gee!
You know him?
GEE:
Hold up. I know him. He's cool.
Ease back, playboy. Ease back.
SCOTTY:
How you feeling, Gee Money, my man?
What's up with your man?
Pat him down.
Pat him down!
SCOTTY:
It's like that?
What the fuck is this?
I don't know you, that's what.
I know you're my man's new contact,
but I don't trust you.
So since you're interrupting my game,
get the fuck out.
Mr. Money, please escort
Mr. Washington off the court.
Take him down the block.
And if this dreadlocked
bomboraas even blinks wrong...
...you lullaby his ass.
Don't forget what we talked about
before at Frankie's.
I'm definitely going to be
the next king.
Yo, Keish, I seen that boy
somewhere before.
KEISHA:
Oh, really?
GEE: That's right, I checked him out
myself. He cooler than a fan.
And the product is 60 percent cheaper
than what the brothers is paying.
That will free up
a whole lot of money
...to do a lot of other things.
Like, maybe take over
another city project?
All right, let's roll with it.
Rebuild and get stronger.
Most definite. Most definite.
Money, I'll tell you something.
If he's not who he says he is...
...I'll kill him.
Then I'll kill you.
N I NO:
I don't trust Mr. Washington.
I want him to stick to me
like flies to shit.
When I was young, I was a member
of a gang, the L.A. Boys.
- Lennox Ave.
- You know it.
The leader, Jughead,
told me to prove my loyalty...
...I had to snuff somebody out.
It was like, "No problem."
I said, "An enemy?"
He said, "No, that's too easy.
It's got to be an ordinary mo."
So I rode down to 23rd.
Copped me a bag of that
red devil angel dust.
I got so zooted.
I walked up on this lady.
She must have been a schoolteacher.
I was so fucking crazy,
I didn't even care.
I stepped to her.
PQW!
I didn't even stay
to see her drop.
I just ran.
You must think I'm a demon.
I guess what you was doing...
...it was like business, right?
It wasn't personal.
My brother...
...it's always business.
Never personal.
NINO: Tell your moms I want some pies.
BOY: Can I get some?
NINO:
Come on in, little man.
Two for you.
Two for you.
Two for you.
Junior!
- Hold up, Pop.
- Get out of here now.
NINO:
I can take care of you too.
Take care of yourself,
because you an ignorant bastard.
You committing genocide on your people
with your fancy suits and cars.
Step off, grandpa.
Idol worshiper!
Killing your people with the
white devils you put in that bottle.
You an idolater.
Reverend Oates,
why are you with this scum?
Shut up!
Nino, let me smoke this old dude.
Look at you. In two years,
they'll be marking your gravesite.
Me?
I'll be right here.
Kids, get out of here!
These kids...
All these people gather around you
like you God almighty.
Like you love them.
Devils ain't got no love.
You're killing your people.
What can you offer them?
Another I-have-a-dream speech?
Some of that same shit
you ripping off to me?
Look at us. Not a pot to piss in,
nor a window to throw it out of.
You's the fool, old man.
OLD MAN:
That's it!
Don't try it.
Don't even think about it!
You don't understand.
OLD MAN:
idolater, you reap what you sow!
NINO:
This is some fly shit.
Some George Raft,
some James Cagney-type shit.
You know what I'm saying?
SCOTTY: That's how you living.
NINO: Living large!
Good looking out this afternoon.
Gee Money should've seen it coming.
Old man really wanted to do me.
Old bastard.
But here's something
that's not so funny.
Gee Money tried to cut
a side deal with me.
You can't trust anybody these days.
You can trust me.
I got your back.
Thank you.
Now Reverend Oates will say
a few words to the happy couple.
REVEREND: You got to wait till
somebody else gets some too, okay?
Before we eat this cake,
we ought to toast...
...my daughter, my new son-in-law
and our gracious host...
...Mr. Nino Brown.
[ALARM SOUNDS]
[DOG BARKS]
Shit!
Fuck!
Good dog.
On, baby.
Come on.
How much I need you
There you go te/lin' me no again
There's nothing
Nothing in the world I would rather have
Than you, girl
[CHATTERING INAUDIBLY]
Thank you.
Yeah?
Held by you
I need, I need somebodyjust like you, girl
Yeah, yeah
There you go te/lin' me no, no, no
NINO:
I got something for you.
That's my business card.
Call me sometime.
GIRLS:
Thank you!
There you go te/lin' me no, no, no, no again
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hello, sweetheart.
GIRL:
Are we going home now, Mommy?
NINO: What's up?
You still mad at me?
- Fuck you, then. Gee!
- What's up?
- Where is the Duh Duh Man?
GEE: Probably after that skeezer.
GEE:
What's with Selina?
NINO:
I don't know. Losing her mind.
Think I care?
This is my world, my money...
...and that's my skeezer.
WOMAN:
You'll get it all over your dress.
GIRL:
Hi, Daddy.
KEISHA:
Hold up a minute.
GIRL:
Thank you, mister.
NINO:
Yo, Gee, it's a hit! Cover me!
[GIRL SCREAMS]
GEE:
Throw me a gun!
SCOTTY:
Get down!
Motherfuckers!
Bastards!
SELINA:
You're a murderer, Nino!
I've seen you kill too many people!
Cancel that bitch.
I'll buy another one.
I hate you!
I hate you, Nino!
[PHONE RINGS]
Don Armeteo's on the phone for you.
We made you. We gave you everything.
Shagazzy's, the Spotlite,
the street corners.
So you got cute.
You had to get spanked.
Now you listen to me.
I made this. Me.
I own this city, you slicked-back,
greasy-haired, son of a bitch!
You're fucked!
[MOTORCYCLE ENGINE]
NEWSCASTER:
This bulletin just in
In a scene to rival the famed
St. Valentine's Day Massacre...
...of 1920s Chicago...
...Don Armeteo, reputed crime lord,
and 10 of his henchmen...
...were gunned down this afternoon...
STONE: I put you two together.
You guys go off on your own.
Now you come back to me?
PERETTI: You're telling me
the disk isn't important?
I'm telling you
I hope it is important.
This is Hawkins.
We go back to law school.
She's the prosecuting attorney.
The son of a bitch used a little girl
as a bulletproof vest.
Watch your language.
Nino is gonna fall.
PERETTI: What about the Pookie video?
- It helps, but it's not enough.
HAWKINS: Nino isn't in the tapes
at The Carter.
He's Mr. Untouchable.
How many more got to die?
I could have smoked him myself.
Can we catch him in a buy?
Or get a witness to testify...
...and connect all the dots?
HAWKINS: Nino's got great connections.
Can we nail any and tie them to Nino?
Check this out.
We got it set up so the
CMB brothers will buy from us.
And I also got it so Nino Brown
definitely doesn't trust Gee Money.
And we'll get it on videotape.
SCOTTY:
Gee Money.
What's up, fellas?
Got the bucks?
NINO: Nice of you to make it.
Know what I'm saying?
SCOTTY:
What can I say?
What's taking so long?
Nino's not moving.
Shit.
- Let's do this.
- Open the briefcase.
NINO:
Easy!
- Very easy.
- I thought we was friends.
I told you, it's never personal, B.
Friends is friends. This is business.
Let's see the sample.
Whatever.
All here, baby.
I knew I knew Washington.
He's five-0!
NINO:
Suck-ass motherfucker!
Punch it! Just do it!
You out a deal
with that motherfucker.
Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Gee.
Fucking Cain.
My brother's keeper.
- Nino, I didn't--
- Was it this...
...glass dick you've been sucking on?
Was that it'? Now I see how you
let that motherfucker infiltrate.
He used you, Gee.
Whatever happened to
"Am I my brother's keeper?"
You know what happened to it.
"The world is mine."
Remember that?
"Everything is mine. Everything!"
Even my woman.
Is that what this is about?
That fucking skeezer?
You think I give a fuck about her?
Fuck that ho bitch!
I don't give a fuck about her!
It ain't about her.
It's about us.
I love you, man.
Nino...
You embarrassed me, man!
In front of all them people,
you treated me like I was soft.
You treated me like I was spineless!
We built this shit!
You didn't do this shit by yourself!
You forgot about me, man.
Your brother.
What has this done to us?
Keisha.
Dead.
The Duh Duh Man.
Dead.
Let's just make it like it was.
Let's be a family.
Let's make it like it was.
Fuck them cars. And them bitches.
And all that shit.
Fuck that shit!
Let's do us, me and you.
Let's be a family again.
I'm on the run.
It can never go back
the way it was.
But I'll tell you how
we can make it right.
CMB.
CMB!
We all we got.
Am I my brother's keeper?
Yes, I am.
You know where Nino Brown lives?
You heard my man.
I ain't telling you shit!
Last summer, we won
this basketball tournament.
Bought the whole team
new red scooters. So kiss my ass.
Kiss my ass with that.
You know something, B?
This dude is a cop. Five-0! B, out!
Come here, punk!
I know where Nino lives.
He beat this kid with
a baseball bat.
Poured gas on him,
set him on fire...
...after he shorted him $5.
I hope you kill his black,
hardened ass.
He's in apartment 6C.
But watch out.
He got bodyguards on the roof.
[TONY MONTANA OVER TV]
Say hello to my little friend.
PERETTI:
Buckwheat.
SCOTTY:
Punk!
WOMAN 1:
Kill him!
How can you wear this and sell poison
to our people? You ain't shit!
Toss him to me.
SCOTTY: That teacher you killed?
That was my mother!
WOMAN 2:
Kick his black ass!
You've squashed and killed
these people with no retribution.
Get your ass up.
This ain't business.
This is personal.
KID:
Do it! Do it!
I want to shoot you so bad,
my dick's hard.
STONE:
Coming through!
Come on, Scotty.
We'll do it the right way.
I'll testify.
Even if it means my life,
I will testify.
Come on.
We can't go out like this.
STONE:
Put the gun down.
Don't throw your life away
on a piece of shit.
MAN: Give me the gun.
I'll do it!
I'll be out in a week.
You're a dead man.
HAWKINS:
Miss Thomas...
Was the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown,
head of the CMB?
Yes.
BAILIFF:
Remove the hat and the sunglasses.
HAWKINS: Detective Appleton,
when you infiltrated the CMB...
...did the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown...
...attempt to buy two and a half kilos
of cocaine from you?
Can Michael Jordan slam dunk?
Of course he did.
He's a dope dealer.
That's what they do,
buy and sell dope.
NINO:
I'm not guilty.
You're the one who's guilty.
Lawmakers, the politicians,
the Colombian drug lords.
All you who lobby against
making drugs legal.
Just like with alcohol
during Prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty.
Let's kick the ballistics here.
Ain't no Uzis made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here
owns a poppy field.
This thing is bigger than Nino Brown.
This is big business.
This is the American way.
I'm sure that the court
was enlightened...
...by your geopolitical tirade.
Unfortunately, society at large
is not on trial here.
You are, Mr. Brown.
Were you or were you not...
...head of the narcotics consortium,
the murderously bloody...
...CMB?
Yes.
HAWKINS: I could not hear you.
Would you please speak up?
Yes, I was a member.
But I was forced into
this way of life.
I've been dealing drugs
since I was 12.
I didn't have the chances
that you have, Miss Hawkins.
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth, Miss Hawkins.
I wanted to get out,
but they threatened to kill my mother.
Who are you talking about,
Mr. Brown? What "they"?
They.
Look at him. Kareem Akbar.
The educated brother from the bank.
He's the head of the CMB.
The brains behind the whole thing.
This is bigger than Nino Brown,
and I got a list to prove it.
If I'm going down, I'm taking
a lot of people with me.
JUDGE: Order in the court!
NINO: Can I speak with my lawyer?
Your Honor, may counsel
approach the bench?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
What's the discussion?
[GAVEL RAPS]
JUDGE: The court is not pleased
with this application.
You understand that by pleading
guilty to a lesser charge...
...the court, under law, can impose
a sentence of three years to life...
...with parole eligibility
after 12 months. Do you understand?
Absolutely.
How'd you let this happen?
We wanted some of the crack
off the streets. I wanted Nino too.
He gave up his connections,
and Powell wanted to make the deal.
COP:
Let's go.
This court is now adjourned.
What? All he gets is a year?
SCOTTY:
This ain't happening.
I should have
killed you myself, bitch!
That's the difference between
you and me.
Don't get mad, Tito. It's the law.
Sucks, huh?
When this is over with,
you can come and work for me.
Did you turn state's evidence?
Did you sell out CMB?
- Are you pleased with the outcome?
