WOMAN: She's been asking to go home.
MAN: Well... well, did you tell her?
WOMAN: Not yet. I thought it best you do it.
MAN: No, she has to understand,
this is her home now.
WOMAN: I can't keep her here.
MAN: But we agreed, Aunt Ida.
You said you'd look after her.
- I am paying you to look after her.

Hello there, Charles.
- Sister.
- (CHUCKLES)
Good to see you.
That's a nice suit you're wearing.
- Oh, yeah.
- Perfect fit.
You're always such a spiffy dresser.
So you...
...come to take me home?
No. No.
Well, it's business, Maud, financial matters.
Oh, good. Well, I'm a natural at math.
Remember?
Always used to check your numbers
when you were in school.
Didn't I, Aunt Ida?
I wanted to drop off a few things for you.
Lordy.
You cleared out my room.
- Why?
- I sold the house.
What?
- Our house?
- Maud... Mom left it to me.
No.
You can't... you...
You can't sell our house.
Charles, you can't sell our house.
I'd... I'd... I'd look after it.
I'd be more than happy
to have my own place, Charles.
You can't look after yourself,
let alone a house and a yard and...
I'd get a job. I'd get a job or something.
- A job? A job doing what?
- I don't know, Charles!
- I'm sorry, Maud. It's done.
- No. Wait. Charles.
Charles.
Charles, wait.
- Don't. Don't.
- Goodbye, sister.
- You can't...
- You take care of yourself.
No, wait. Charles.
Maud.
Come get your tea.
Charles! Charles!
Wait!
Gonna do some painting out here.
Too messy. Why don't you put
your things away in your room?
Why don't you leave me alone?

You better not tell me
you were out at that club.
Wasn't gonna tell you that.
Where were you?
At the club. (CHUCKLES)
Wasn't gonna tell you that.
Only looking to meet friends.
That's what you said the last time.
Look what happened.
You should try it sometime.
You might like it.
This is new.
(DOOR BELL JINGLES)
Well, well, well, look who's gracing me
with their presence today.
- What can I do for you, Everett?
- I'm looking for a woman.
- A what?
- Uh, a... hou... housemaid.
- Looking for a housemaid.
- Not the kind of thing we sell.
Am I... am I an idiot, huh?
No, I wanna put up a sign, you know, a...
...what do you... what do you call them?
Well, I need you to write...
- CLERK: To write a sign.
- Yeah.
- EVERETT: Mm-hm.
- Okay.
EVERETT: Looking for a housemaid.
Must have her own...
Oh, shit! Her own...
what's the word I'm looking for?
- Sense of humor?
- No.
No.
Cleaning tools. Must have her own
cleaning tools. That's it. That'd do it.
- Yeah. And then you...
- Contact Everett Lewis.
Yeah, sign my name. Right.
Here. Give it to me.
That's it.
Need a hand, that's all.
(PIN CLATTERS ON FLOOR)
Hello, big boy.
Beautiful. You are.
(DOG BARKING)
Hey. Hey.
You a guard? You a guard dog? Hey, hello.
Hello.
Oh.
Hello.
Um, I'm Maud.
Dowley.
- Dowley.
- Yeah. That's right.
I was...
Got your ad at the store.
The one you posted, looking for a housemaid.
Yeah. Well, I'm answering it.
Looking for a woman.
Well...
...what do you think I am?
(CHUCKLES INCREDULOUSLY)
So...
Well...
Well, I...
...I walked here from Digby.
Wouldn't mind a cup of tea.
You can tell me what you're looking for.
Thank you.
So...
...this all yours?
This house?
- Nice.
- Used to be Captain John Ryan's.
But I moved it here from the wharf.
(CRACKS KNUCKLES)
Guess how many oxen it took to move it.
Two?
Not two. No. Seven.
- Seven oxen.
- That's a lot of oxen.
Mm.
It'd be nice...
...for you to have someone around here.
Yeah, must be hard to do it all on your own.
Yeah, you got that right, ma'am.
Got that right, you know.
- What is it you do?
- Sell fish.
Sell chopped wood. You know.
Work at the orphanage.
Lordy.
- How do you keep it straight?
- Got a lot on my plate.
- Got a lot on my plate.
- Yeah.
I'd like the job.
You walk funny. You a cripple?
- No.
- No? You're not sick or nothing?
No, I just... I just walk funny.
It don't stop me.
I can do the work of five women.
(LIGHTS MATCH)
You got an ashtray?
Flick 'em on the floor.
Thanks.
Ouch.
Many women apply for the job?
You finished with your tea?
Well...
...might as well say it.
I'll put it...
Well...
You do need the help. I can see that.
A long walk home.
I bet they'll throw rocks at me again.
Who throws rocks?
The kids. They don't mean it.
They don't mean it. I don't care.
Some people don't like it
if you're different.
It's a lot of work to break in a new shoe.
Heels are galled right off.
This is far as... far as we go.
- Huh?
- Far as we go.
Oh, okay. Uh... wait...
Come on.
Everything okay, Everett?
Thinking about hiring a woman
help around the house...
...but slim pickings applied for the job.
- Someone actually applied?
- Might be better with one of these boys.
These kids are too young, Everett.
Oh, when I was their age,
did the work of 10 men.
Cleaned this yard,
chopped wood, built that fence.
Yes, but you were here, around people.
Everett?
If someone applied for that job, hire them.
(CAR HORN BLARES)
Hi.
Nice day out.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
I suppose I'll give you a try. Mm.
- That'd be nice.
- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm. Be nice.
IDA: Maud!
- You gonna stand there all day?
- No, no.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Yeah.
Coming. Coming.
- IDA: You're neglecting your chores.
- MAUD: Yeah, I know.
- God in heaven.
- Yeah.
I'm a grown woman now.
I'll go off and find my own place.
- You can't look after yourself, Maud.
- I know you think that.
You are determined to put
a stain on this family name.
- Mm-hm.
- (CAR HORN BLARES)
If you leave now, you are never coming back.
- Do you know that?
- Yeah, I know. I know that.
Sorry. Got a job now.
You been good to take me in,
but I gotta go now.
He's waiting for me.
- Bye, Aunt Ida.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
Go.
Uh...
I'm assuming...
...assuming I'm working for room
and board, but...
...I was thinking an extra 25 cents
spending money as well...
...a week?
(GRUMBLES)
(DOG BARKING)
There you are.
Thought you left me for a minute.
What do you want me to do first?
If I stand over you all day,
I may as well do it myself. Hm?
No...
(DOG BARKING)
(DOGS BARKING)
You going through my stuff?
No. No, just...
...pretty.
Well, you think that's why I brought you
out here, so you could...
...go through my gear, huh?
No.
I made you soup.
What is that? Huh?
- Turnip.
- I don... I don't eat turnip.
Oh.
You haven't even cleared the table.
- I was just... I was just...
- You want me to pay you money...
...but you don't know a click about cleaning.
No, no, no. No, no, not gonna work.
No, no lazy arses around here.
No lazy arses around here!
You get your stuff and get out!
No! No! No!
Why you do that?
- Where do you want me to go, huh?
- Should've thought of that...
...when you were sitting here twiddling
your thumbs going through my stuff.
- I didn't know what you wanted me to do.
- I don't want to have to look after you.
I want somebody
who's gonna do the looking after!
Not some crippled-up woman. Now get out!
- I'm getting out!
- It's my house! My house!

The big one.
So...
...I'm gonna stay, where do I sleep?
Are you gonna follow my rules?
- Mm.
- Mm? You cleaned? Clean upstairs?
- No.
- No?
- There's only one bed up there.
- Oh, you're a princess, eh?
When I was at the orphanage...
...they put us six, seven to a bunk, hm.

If you're too fancy to pile in, then
you can take your little knickknacks...

No, I'm... I'm good up there.
I'm not too fancy.

MAUD: Bad dogs!
Down. Get down. Down. Yeah, good boy.
Who told you you could talk
to them dogs like that?
What... they gotta learn.
Them dogs been here longer
than you. More useful too.
I'm only... I'm only trying to feed 'em.
Let me tell you how it is

Would it make it more proper

Maybe people won't talk so much.
Aunt Ida?
You wanna come visit me sometime?
I wouldn't be caught dead.
I wouldn't even drive by that house.
(DOOR BELL JINGLES)
Suits me.
Love slave.
- What are you gonna do with all this, Ev?
- Sell it. Or just leave it.
Sell it? Who'd buy that?

Hello.
Uh...
- Hello there.
- Hello there.
It's a nice day.
- Everett got himself a woman?
- Mm.
- Get back in the house.
- What's this now?
Ah, she works for me. Need somebody
to mind the house, else I get robbed.
So you got yourself a tiny,
little woman to guard your house?
Couldn't you get a meaner dog?
Or a gun?
Wait.
Come here.
I'm Frank. I'm the fisherman
he tries to cheat every day.
He wouldn't cheat you. He's a good man.
Oh, so... so you don't know him well, I see.
Yeah.
I'm Maud.
Dowley.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
So you're working here, then.
- Yeah. I'm... I'm living...
- That's enough.
So you got yourself a live-in maid, do you?
Out all day. Work hard. I deserve to
come home to a clean house. Don't I?
Where do you fit?
There's more room in there than you think.
We find it cozy in there, don't we?
(LAUGHS)
Oh!
- Get back in the house!
- (MAUD SOBBING)

EVERETT: I'm in charge of this house.
If she don't know it, she'll learn it.
FRANK: Nobody in their right mind
would put up with that for very long.
Well, she's not in her right mind.
That's one thing I know.
Learned your lesson?
Do you want me here or don't you?
Hm?
Because I'll go.
I'll walk out right now.
Well, do you want me here or not?
I'd like my pay, please.
You haven't paid me yet, not once.
Two months.
Yeah, aye.

Hello?
Are you the fish peddler's wife?
Some snazzy shoes there.
Oh.
No. Sorry.
Well, is he around?
Uh...
...he's... he's out on his rounds.
I paid for fish, and he never delivered.
Oh, well...
- ...sometimes he forgets.
- I paid him, plus a handsome tip.
Now, I'm here from New York City
for the next few months...
...and I can give him my business or not.
You... you sure he never
dropped off the fish?
May... maybe a dog ran off with it.
- I don't have a dog.
- Or a cat.
- Cats love fish.
- I don't have a cat either.
Oh.
Well...
...well, I'll tell him you came by.
Say...
Yeah?
Did you paint that happy, little chicken?
Actually, yeah.
There was a chicken out in the yard.
Real fat.
I wanted to remember his happier days, so...
...painted him.
Well...
...I'll tell him to square up
with you when he gets home.
I'd appreciate that.
What's your name?
Maud.
Nice to meet you, Maud.
I'm Sandra.
Nice to meet you, Sandra.

...they comfy?
Ah...
...they're not bad.
No. They're not bad.
- All the way from New York City.
- (CHUCKLES)
Who told you you could
paint fairies on the wall, huh?
They're not fairies. They're birds.
Well, who told you you could do that, huh?
Well, you did.
- What?
- You said... you said...
"...Make the place look all right."
I think it looks all right.
No painting in this corner, huh?
I don't want paint on my boots.
No paint on my gear.
The rest is fine.
Birds or fairies, I don't mind.
I won't do that.
Good?
Long day?
Hm.
Must be hard running a business.
My brother Charles used to run
one of them jazz clubs...
...for a while.
People always on his back
for money he owed them.
I never owe nobody nothing.
Charles said the same thing.
Couldn't prove it, you see.
People are stupid.
- You're not.
- Mm.
You keep track of it all in your head.
Most people can't, you see.
That's why you gotta write it all down.
I can write it down for you, if you like.
I'm good at writing.
So...
...who...
...owes...
...Everett...
...Lewis?
Hm?
- Donovan.
- Donovan.
- Donovan.
- Owes me for six fish.
Six fish.
- What?
- That is a bird.
That, I don't know what that is,
but it's not a bird.
That is finished.
It's got a beak on it.
That ain't got no beak on it yet.
Are you gonna do that?
Are we ready to get married?
Costs money.
Foolish.
Only if you invite people and stuff.
Give them supper.
You gotta pay a fee for a license.
- Hm?
- Hm.
Yep.
Charles had a fancy wedding.
I thought I wouldn't do that.
I'd do it cheap.
Wouldn't invite anyone.
- Wouldn't do what Charles did.
- Why you talking about him?
Well...
...you plan on doing what you're doing,
think we should get married.
I don't wanna get
in that sort of trouble again.
What kind of trouble?
I had a baby.
Baby died.
She was real deformed.
They buried her when...
...when I was sleeping.
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
Here.
You wanted three fish.
I owed you for two. So...
- ...now you owe me for one.
- It's a card.
Well, we... we figured it out on the card.
We're rendering accounts. So...
...you know, it won't be a mix-up.
And how do I know this is right?
Because I said.
We could maybe start clean...
...from now on. Keep track.
Maybe.
SANDRA: Give me a moment.
I am the boss.
- Yeah, you. I know that.
- Who's in charge?
- You are.
- I bring in the money. Right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so who's in charge?
- Yeah. You are.
- Yeah. Right.
- Don't forget it.
- Yeah. I can't... can't forget it.
I'll pay you, if you make me
some more of these cards.
I don't know.
He's in charge, so...
...ask him.
Throw in an extra 5 cents?
How about 10 cents a card?
Sounds good. Suits me.
SANDRA: Good.
And I'll take my fish.
I look forward to these cards... very much.
Thanks. See what I can do.
MAUD: Wait up. You're good, Ev.
You know? Really know what you're doing.
Asking for that money.
Pretty house.
- Pretty house.

You got... got... got any boards?
EVERETT: Take a look around.
(DOOR BELL JINGLES)
MR. DAVIS: Good morning.
Mm-hm. Well, three more.
I don't know why people pay money
for these. My 5-year-old could do better.

Maybe he could, but he didn't.
Maud did. Brushes, please.
Well, you're an idiot.
MAUD: You're an idiot.
Stupid.

- MAUD: Would you like a bowl of soup?
- SANDRA: Oh, no, thank you.
Here. Sit down.
- Like a cup of tea?
- I'm fine, Maud.
The reason I'm here is...
...I'd like to see
one of your larger paintings.
Oh, well...
...well, I... I don't do larger paintings.
Just the little cards.
- I'm willing to pay your price.
- Mm. Yeah, she does.
Yup, we got some fine gobs of paint here...
- ...splashed on these boards.
- MAUD: No.
EVERETT:
Yeah, these will be right up your alley.
- Oh...
- EVERETT: There.
SANDRA: Look at that.
It's a lovely winter scene.
MAUD: There's some deer.
Well...
- Uh...
- Isn't she beautiful?
Yeah, I haven't finished it.
And this tree has red leaves.
This one has green.
- MAUD: Mm-hm.
- What season is it?
Uh, well, I guess it's...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
It's everything that's pretty
about all the seasons.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm-hm.
EVERETT: Well, how much, hm? How much?
- No.
- What's your price?
- Uh...
- Five dollars.
- SANDRA: Done.
- EVERETT: Done.
MAUD: No. No. Uh, I'm not...
I'm not selling it.
- It's all right.
- EVERETT: Yeah.
- I'm not selling that one.
- Already sold.
I haven't finished it.
MAUD: I have... I haven't finished it.
Well, I was just pulling your leg now.
It's a joke. This one's not for sale.
You know, I have an even better idea.
Why don't I commission you
to paint me something?
You can paint me anything
on a board, just like that.
Just whatever you want.
And I'll pay you for it.
You can send it to me in New York.
Show me how you see the world.
For five dollars?
Five dollars.
Uh, to New York?
That's a long way. Does that include postage?
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Maud.
- EVERETT: Sandra.
- Sandra.
- You guys are best friends, huh?
- (CHUCKLES)
S... sold a painting.
(CHUCKLES)
Better get painting.
Dishes come first, yeah?
- Six dollars.
- Yeah.
- Boy, she's an idiot.
- (LAUGHS)
- Give her one of the ones you already done.
- No, I wouldn't do that.
- Everett?
- Hm?
Do you like 'em? My paintings?
How am I supposed to know, hm?
- Do I look like a woman? Hm?
- No. (CHUCKLES)
- But I know what that is.
- It's a cat.
No. That's my name.
- Huh?
- Oh.
- What's my name doing there?
- Well, you know...
...figured we're in business together.
The painting's half yours.
Your name should be on it too.
Mm-hm.
(CHUCKLES)
Well...
...not forgetting about
your housework now, are you?
No. No chance of that.
I just gotta finish this one first.
- You don't wanna neglect your chores.
- I won't.
Well...
...I'll do the sweeping,
but I'm not doing everything. Hm?
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

Hmm.
Well...

...then you are stupider than you look.
We live together. We lay down together.
- Why not get married?
- (CHUCKLES)
Just because I don't have women
banging down my door...
...doesn't mean I gotta marry
first one comes along.
We've been living together for some time now.
That's what most people do.
- I don't like most people.

It's true.
I like you.

congratulations or condolences...

It's not crooked enough.
I'm still gonna be contrary tomorrow.

Yeah. Crusty and gray.

You never called me an artist
when we were young.

- No different now.
- Want a cup of tea, Charles?
- Oh, no, no.
- Thank you for asking, though.
- Mm-hmm.
So, uh, where's your, uh...
...your man?
Out on his rounds, I suppose.
Be back soon, if you wanna meet him.
Oh, I don't have much time.
I just wanted to...
...come by and maybe get one
of your paintings, huh?
Yeah.
Aunt Ida said you don't see a nickel
of money from these paintings.
- That right?
- Yeah.
What's he doing with your money, Maud?
(LAUGHS)
Why isn't he building onto the house?
Getting the place wired?
- Why would he wanna do that?
- (LAUGHS)
It's his house. His choice.
Yeah, but you're capable of making
decisions, aren't you, Maud?
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah?
Yes, I am.
You know, Maud...
...you need someone to give you advice
on how to handle your money.
Someone a little more savvy than him.
Someone who...
Like you?
- Well, I know money, yeah.
- You know debt.
Selling Mom's house.
You like money too much, Charles.

My brother, Charles.
CHARLES: Hello.
- He come to buy a painting.
- Mm-hmm.
Just, uh, which one, huh?
Big ones are $5.
Are you gonna buy one, or what?
(LAUGHS) Yeah. Just grab one.
That one's $6.
- Price gone up.
- Six?
I only...
- It's... it's lovely.
- Bye, Charles.
Goodbye, sister.
(CAR STARTS)
(FLY BUZZING)
Get out.
Got a letter today.
From Vice President Nixon.
What'd he want?
A painting.
- A painting?
- Mm-hmm.
Unless he sends money for a painting...
...won't send him any.
Good. That's good.
Maybe then we can afford a screen door.
Don't need a screen door.
I'm the one working 14 hours a day...
...so you can just sit there
in the corner and paint away.
Oh? My paintings earn money.
Yeah. Bring in a few pennies.
But I'm the one doing all the work.
- Right?
- (FLY BUZZING CONTINUOUS)
- Yeah.
- You can't even keep the fire going.
I want a cup of tea when I get home.
- Gets hot in here in the day.
- Yeah, so? Open the door.
Then the flies get in.
- That's why we need a screen door.
- No screen door.
(HUMMING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
(TRUCK ENGINE IDLING)
Can I get you to hold it up
a little bit higher, please?
Thank you.
All right. How long did it take you
to make this painting, Maud?
Two... two or three days.
Two days? Two or three days, yes?
Do you enjoy painting?
Oh, yes. I've been doing it all my life.
Mr. Lewis, come out, please.
Join us.
Can I get you to look towards
the camera this way, Mr. Lewis?
And smile, maybe? Nice. Thank you.
Now, you've painted most of the house.
Well, I started with the birds
and the flowers.
Over there.
And he didn't tell me to stop, so...
...kept going. (CHUCKLES)
Everett, you must feel very lucky
to have Maud as your wife.
Maud Lewis has been an artist
most of her life.
Her paintings have even been sold
to Vice President Nixon.
This happy couple, who only live
with the bare necessities of life...
...and yet somehow, they flourish.
EVERETT: I chop the wood. I do
the dishes. Now all she does is paint.
MAUD: Paint a picture a day.
Paint all seasons.
EVERETT: I told her a wife
is supposed to mind her husband.
She does as she likes.
REPORTER: Who would have thought
this little, arthritic woman...
...living on the fringe of society...
...would have such incredible
and far-reaching success?
You can find Maud Lewis still selling
her paintings from the front steps...
...of her little house here
in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- WOMAN: Take it easy there, Ida.
- IDA: Hold my arm. That's it.
There we go.
Door.
I'm good.
I saw you.
On the news.
You lucked into it with her, didn't you?
She's all smiles,
and you nothing but grumbles.
Wait.
I want you to tell her to come see me.
Please.
(BELL DINGS)
I can do it. I can do it. Go.
EVERETT:
Never you mind about how sick she was.
I asked you a question. What...
Oh, what?
Was I nasty on the TV?
No, Everett.
Well, everyone's giving me queer looks.
Talking about me behind my back.
Never mind what other people are doing.
Everyone thinks you're as sweet as pie.
They don't know. They don't know
what you're like to live with.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
- Get up.
- What? Where are we going?
- Get up.
- Where are we going?
- Aunt Ida's.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Putting my foot down.
- Huh?
- Not going.
What? Everett!
What if she dies and I didn't
get to say goodbye, huh?
What if I die and you're not here,
and you didn't get to say goodbye?
- You're being silly.
- No. Not taking you.
I don't need you. I can get there on my own.
You don't even...
you don't even know how to drive.
Well, no.
I know how to walk.
Give me that.
Good to see you, Ida.
I watched you on the TV.
Did you? What did you think?
You're the only one in our family
who ended up happy.
Well...
...yeah, suppose I did.
(CHUCKLES)
I don't wanna die...
- ...full of regrets.
- Yeah, I know.
I know.
I regret...
...not letting you hold her, at least.
What's that?
Your baby.
I know. You did it to protect me.
I know that.
You know, she was...
...real deformed, so, you know.
She wasn't deformed.
She wasn't deformed?
Why'd she die, huh?
She didn't.
What?
Charles sold her.
He did what?
He sold her to a good home. Older people.
We didn't think that you'd be able
to take care of a child.
Charles and...
...and I decided.
I was told she's...
...she's been well-loved.
(WHIMPERS)
Is she crooked or what?
She was fine.
I gotta go now.
Never asked for this.
Get up in the morning.
People.
Come home from work.
People.
Got my face on the TV...
...for all the world to laugh at.
- Everett, listen to me. Ida...
- No, you listen to me.
You think that you're too good for me.
That you don't need me anymore.
Well, that's fine. You go find someone else.
Fine. If that's what you want.
- My baby, Charles. They sold her.
- Give up on that goddamn baby!
Nothing but that baby, the brother, the baby!
Nothing but misery. My brother, my baby.
She lived.
I thought she died. She lived.
More pain.
Ever since you stepped into my life.
Nothing but pain.
I was better off without you.
- What, are you gonna get out?
- Yeah.
Well, good riddance!
(GRUNTS)
(EVERETT SNARLS)
(GASPS)
SANDRA: Come in, Maud.
Thanks.
Sorry.
I've made up a bed in the spare room.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Maud...
...can you teach me how to paint?
No one can teach that.
If you wanna paint, you paint, I suppose.
I don't go nowhere, so...
...paint from memory, I suppose.
I make my designs up.
I've known you four years, Maud.
- Yeah.
- It's true.
I know.
And I'm still trying to figure out
what makes you tick.
Don't know.
Don't... I don't want for much, you know?
As long as I got a brush
in front of me, I don't care.
A window.
I love a window.
A bird whizzing by.
Bumblebee.
It's always different.
The whole of life.
The whole of life already framed.
Right there.
Something up, pal?
Well, she left me.
About time, eh?
(KNOCKS)
(DOOR OPENS)
EVERETT: You'd never last here.
It's a seven-mile walk to the store.
I mean...
...harder to look after than a dog.
I'm better...
...I'm better than a dog.
- What?
- I'm better than a dog.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
Hey, see that cloud?
That one.
It kind of looks like a woman
with a big arse.
(SNICKERS)
Bald on one side of the head.
See?
You see her? She's looking right at you.
I don't see her. Mm-mm.
You don't see her?
I see you.
What do you see?
I see you as my wife.
I always have.
I just...
...I don't want you to leave me.
Why would I do that?
Because you can do much better than me.
No.
I couldn't.
I got everything I want with you, Ev.
Everything.
What are we doing here, Ev?
Why are we stopped here?
That's her house. The white one.
MAUD: Whose house?
Her.
Your girl.
- My baby lives here?
- Mm.
A woman now.
How'd you find her?
- She lives there?
- Mm-hmm.
WOMAN: Looks great.
MAN: I'm gonna go wash up for dinner.
WOMAN: Okay. I'll be in shortly.
She's so beautiful.
She's perfect.
(WIND GUSTING)
(SIGHS)
One...
You got a big bunch of mail there.
Oh, same as yesterday?
I can't go any further, Ev.
Can't go any further.
Here. Here.
I don't know what's wrong with my legs today.
(MAUD GASPS SOFTLY)
(CHUCKLES)
- MAUD: It's cold, huh?
- Yeah.
MAUD: Guess I won't be skiing this winter.
(LOUD THUD)
(WIND GUSTING)
(GASPS)
Everett.
Ev.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathe.
(WHEEZES)
Breathe.
You haven't given up smoking, have you?
Give it up sometimes.
You have emphysema, Maud. You can't smoke.
Won't be smoking anymore.
- MAUD: Yeah.
- I'll tell you that.
I have arthritis. It hurts.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
It's...
...hard to hold a brush now.
Can you get me anything
for my arthritis, please?
- I'll get you something.
- Thank you.
DOCTOR:
And, uh... air the place out a bit, Everett.
Air's too thick.
Is he gone?
Yeah.
He's gone.
Silly.
There you are.
- Tea.
- Yeah. Thank you.
- There you go.
- I got it.
(WHEEZES)
You should have kept more dogs.
Don't want any dog.
You like dogs.
But I got you.
You know...
...should get me some more dogs.
Hey.
- Are you drinking all my tea?
- Mm-hmm.
- There you go.
- Share it.
Yeah.
(LOUD CLATTER)
- Maud?
- (GROANS)
- Maudie? Whoa, now.
- (GASPS)
What is it? What is it?
(MAUD GROANING)
- Can you get in there? Yeah.
- Yeah.
All right. There you go.
Everett. Everett.
Everett.
- (GASPS)
- (CAR DOOR CLOSES)
(ENGINE STARTS)
NURSE: She's going to be all right.
We'll look after her now.
- MAUD: No!
- NURSE: You're gonna be fine, Maud.
(GASPS SOFTLY)
I knew you were getting sicker.
But every time I'd ask, you'd lie to me.
(WHIMPERS)
Wonder...
...how I ever thought
you weren't perfect. Huh?
(MAUD SHUSHING)
Come here.
Come here.
I was loved.
I was loved, Ev.
(SIGHS)
MAUD: The whole of life...
...already framed.
Right there.
