OK, shoo, go play.
I'm going to get you.
(GIGGLES)
How you doing?
- I want some of this pussy before you go.
- (CHUCKLES)
How about you behave?
I could have done with you coming back
earlier to help get the kids ready.
I was working.
Did you go training?
- Do I not provide for my kids?
- You do.
So what's the problem?
The problem is the kids need their dad,
not some guy who just works
all the time and gives them money.
Take them to the park or something.
Well, that's what you do, I work four jobs.
Memories are just as important.
You know I don't like being around
a lot of people and the jobs change.
Too often.
"The boss didn't like me, I had to leave."
(CHUCKLES)
Look, I'm temping in this office later,
if they like me it could become permanent,
you know, my job is to provide and
protect this family and that's what I do.
How can you protect us if you're never here.
(HUFFS) I'm a man I've got to pay my way.
You know law pays well, and when Mimi goes
to nursery full time I'm going back to work.
It doesn't make you less
of a man being with the kids.
No, I look after us, that's what I do!
Why do you push everyone away?
What if I spend too much time
with them and they end up like me?
I'd be proud.
You know what I'd love?
Every Sunday morning
I take the kids to the mall and
there's this little place
that we have breakfast in.
Every week I sit waiting and just hope that
one day you'll come in and surprise us.
Just us sitting there as a family.
That'd be nice.
I can button myself.
- Give Daddy a hug.
- Come here, Mimi.
Oh.
Thank you so much, that's so nice.

MIMI: I want that...
- Is that for me? Yes?
- Yes.

But you don't even look like you're ageing.
I feel like I'm ageing.
- How's the little ones?
- Yeah, good, yeah, we're...
We're all right, yeah.
Good.
And then the gun went off and I woke up here.
OK.

she's doing English, Art, Film,
she's really creative, she must...

- Absolutely not,
you were here six months ago, no.
Oh, please come on, let's not do this again.
You don't have to. I work.

I must have left my phone
at the hotel over there.
Can you come for me and put it in my maps?
No, babe, I've got somewhere to be.
Why don't you just ask reception

No.

We work our own hours.
You know how it is with a kid.
Although to be honest,
I don't think he's mine.
I think the missus played out on me.
You don't think your kid's yours?
He looks nothing like me.
- Do you play about on her?
- No.
Well not...
What do you want?
In the hospital you were
trying to tell me something.
Listen, I don't want to get involved but
I don't think what happened
to your brother was an accident.
I found this envelope
and it had your name on it.
- What are you talking about?
- Like...
Who was it from, where is it?
It's back at the flat,
I haven't even opened it.

Why, what have I done?
You got the address on the card.
Come and find out.
I'm not just going to go to
some random address
when I don't even know
what's going on, I just need to know
that my missus and my kids are not in danger.
Everyone's in danger around you, aren't they?
I think it's because
you have an air of unlikeability.
I mean I've only just got here
and I don't like you already.
Unlikeability.
Now I'm not sure that's a word
but I am sure that I'm going to cut you,
and when I'm done with you I might
even come back and cut your kids.
No, you ain't going to touch my fucking kids.
You ain't going to touch my fucking kids,
you cut them and I'll fucking...

I could have a night alone.

We're just asking and I'm curious.
Bruv have you got your passport on you now?
Did you see that wino walking about?
- He's a dickhead, man.
- Is that how you talk about your friends?
Well, he's not really a friend.
I don't know why that pussy got sent anyway.
Do you think I would have
got clocked finding the dons house?
Never. Never fam.
I'd appreciate
if you didn't insult other men by
calling them an albeit
now accepted colloquial word
referring to the female genitalia
as if we're somehow weaker than you.
- You are weaker, look at you.
- Child birth.
You ain't even got kids.

No, that's Alder's girl from the X1 crew, no?
If he fucks with me, I'm raping it.
Don't be so fucking vile.
What's the matter with you?
Really though why do girls do that?
Well, hang on,
I swear you hang with us, love.
None of you have fucked me.
Yeah, not yet you slag.
How many times have I said
don't stand out front?
Get inside.
Fucking hate that prick, man.
- Save it for the fucking test, bruv.
- Yeah, tell him.
- Yo, Hugs, Marshall hates you, fam.
- Shut up, man, I'll fucking punch you.

My legs, man, what's the fucking matter
with you cuz?
Get in the house, bruv, shut up.
Why are you still looking out the window?
They said they might
deliver the club card today.
What's wrong with you?
I don't want their club card, babe.
What, a man can't live in his own country
without being offered free things
that give him discount?
If I want to pay full price
because I've earned it, that's my right.
That makes no sense.

If we wanted him dead he would be,
now you, you I said I'd cut.
DALEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Mooks wouldn't want blood
on the Indian marble, would he?
It's Indian.
Right, you lot go
and do whatever it is you lot do.
Let me speak with our guest.
Now I've just done you a favour,
so I'm hoping you'll agree to behave.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Let's go for a walk.
Ever hear of the Daley family?
Mob out of Essex.
Used to be run
by all the birds in the family,
people used to call us the Daley Females.
I mean, never to our faces,
no they weren't brave enough for that.
And then I came along.
And do you know what that makes me?
Well?
A cunt.
(CHUCKLES)
The Daley Male.
Get it?
And now I run it all.
Well, me and Mooks,
and there's a reason I'm telling you
all this, but we'll get to that.
(LAUGHS)
Got a bit about you boy, ain't you?
I like it.
Now the one with the Stanley knives
is called Hugs
cos he likes to cuddle people
when he stabs them,
and he's a horrible little bastard.
Now he used to work for Mister
when he was younger.
Who are you talking about?
The Chakra.
Huh?
Never mind mate,
it's just something they used to say.
- (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV)
- (SIGHS)
Still thinking about that club card?
Huh?
Oh, oh, um...
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it was a good deal, you know.
Just go and pick it up tomorrow.
I think it was one of those
one day only things.
Yeah, you know what, I might just go
get one of them now, you know, I think.
Yeah, I think I might just do that now, be...
I won't be long, OK? See you later.
Anything that people want, we can facilitate,
and I need people to run it for me.
Imported foreign slags.
Do whatever I tell them.
- (SNAPS FINGERS)
- You.
You want to fuck one?
No? All right.
I fucked them all.
I love a foreign slag.
Mooks won't fuck them though.
He won't touch this lot.
He likes them high class escorts,
and he must have fucked
everyone in Kensington.
He fucks them,
then beats the shit out of them,
and I mean it's nasty
but what are they going to do?
I just want to know
who's messing with my family.
Scared, ain't you?
See, things have changed
since you was a fucking bad boy,
it's all about the money now,
and me, I've got a few million
in a safe at home.
So I ain't got to worry about which one
of my muscle is gonna stab me in the back,
cos I pay them well enough
to do what I tell them.
See people don't speak about
what they see in here,
cos well I might be smiling, boy,
but no one fucks with me or Mooks.
Anyway, back to my point.
Opportunity.
You come work for me
and I'll change shit for you.
Your kids, that little
chocolate wife you've got,
I'll make the madness stop.
So what do you think?
No.
All right.
Down the stairs, turn right,
through the double doors.
You remember me, boy?
I had a lot of time to think
about what I was going to do to you
when I got out of jail.
My brother was nothing to do with that.
So just tell me what I need to do
to make this stop and I'll do it.
(CHUCKLES)
Where are you?
Well I'm here, you made me come here.
No, no.
Where are you?
(JAMAICAN ACCENT) "Where gone? You get me?"
I don't talk like that any more.
- Why not?
- I grew up.
"Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose."
Remember?
Where is he?
I know he's still in there.
That's who I want.
I'm not playing this game with you
so leave my family alone.
It's interesting you say those words,
"My family".
Because I have no family
and that's your fault,
so now,
I have nothing to lose.
Everything you've take from me,
Trevor, everything else,
I want it back.
(CHUCKLES)
But I...
I don't want to take this on.
I want the rude boy back,
the youth that dared to take me on,
because this is only gonna end one way.
Look.
Times change.
People change.
No matter how many times you're told,
you never really get it
when you're young, but you learn.
People that were so important
in your life for whatever reason
disappear and new people take their place.
But, you know, it's weird how
through all of that you can do this one thing
that people think defines what you're about.
And it doesn't matter if you're sorry,
it doesn't even matter if you embrace it
as a part of who you are.
No matter how much you try to move on,
no matter how much you try to evolve,
no matter how much you try
to dull the memory of it
or explain to people
that you've improved as a person,
they always try and drag you back in.
And I remember what I said,
I remember I said,
"Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose,"
but I was wrong.
Because the only person more dangerous
than someone with nothing to lose...
Is someone who stands to lose everything.
(SLURPING)
Fuck me, this is great.
It's like watching two fucking
silverback monkeys waiting to fight.
He came to me couple of months ago,
arse hanging out,
I offered him a load of cash,
he didn't want it.
All he wanted was for me
to facilitate him fucking with you.
Well, I don't miss a bargain.
Please don't do this.
No, hold on.
I just offered you a way out.
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot, what am I like?
Janette?
Janette, get in here, love.
Hello, Sam.
Sorry, Mick.
How has your day been?
CURTIS: This is just the start.
I'm not done with you.
I'll destroy everything you love.
Fuck.
Fucking what are you like, bruv?
Go on, cuz.
What, you want to try that again
without your pool balls, cuz?
- Just let him go.
- Shut up.
Yo fam, you're old cuz,
go look after your grandkids.
- You has-been.

Just get out of my way, blud.
- Did you just say "blud"?
- (LAUGHING)
No one says blud any more cuz, like...
What year you living in?
Do you know what? I know,
he wants to fuck with the young'uns
like he's some fucking
Rolf Harris or something.
Fuck you.
Hey!
What, you'll get your chin lifted
around here bruv.
You can't do fuck all to me.
It was me who shot your brother,
what the fuck are you going to do about that?
Hugs! Hugs!
(GRUNTS)
Leave him.
Going to bang my mouth are you's?
Leave him. Get off.
He's just banged me in my face,
he's not going to hold a shot no?
He's got to hold a couple shots at least.
Oi, move, move. Oi, back up! Back up!
Get back. Or I'll heat up in here, yeah?
Mine's a shotter. A shotter.
Come on, come on, come on.
Is that a sonic hat?
Go, go, go.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
That's a shotter you know.
Fucking hell.
That was a mad thing, we fucked him up.
Why did you let him up?
Bruv he had a strap bruv,
I was about to get bursted.
What, the guy in the suede shoes
and the fucking lumberjack shirt?

Nah. Nah, nah.
What the fuck bruv?
Come here, come here. Come here.
Hey.
Did you give them the finger?
What about you?
Back up before I heat it up,
what are you fucking cooking?
I don't know what kids say these days.
- I just wanted to get you out.
- What kind of getaway car is this?
This is not a getaway car,
this is a family car.
I've got the child seat in the back,
a ninja turtle I pretended was a gun,
and this is my son's hat.
So how about "Thank you
for coming to get me," huh?
How about that?
Thank you.
By the way if your son's hat fits you
it's definitely your kid.
Are you trying to say I've got a big head?
Or you trying to say my son's got a big head?
Now my cousin Jerry, now he's got a big head.
- I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Fuck you man.
- Come here.
- No bruv you took it too far.
My bad, look I'm sorry,

You're one of my boys, please,

Bruv I know you've got

Am I a dickhead cuz?
I ain't got nothing in my hands,
I ain't got nothing.
Nothing in my hands. Give me a hug.
- All right man, all right.

Come on, that's it, yeah.
(SHUSHING)

- Oi, keep your head.

Get in the fucking Jeep and remember
why you're not on the pavement with him.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Get in the Jeep.
FYI, I don't like you either.
(ENGINE STARTS)
- SAM: Then I came straight here.
- OK.
They're the ones that shot my brother,
they told me.
Tell me something that gives me
a reason to visit Daley
and we'll look at Curtis as well.
OK, look, they had weapons there and drugs
and girls, like sex slaves
and a lot of other shit.
I mean, look I just need to know
that Kayla and the kids are going to be safe.
Can you do that?
You saw all of this?
Its run by some guy called Daley,
there's some guy called Hugs, there's Curtis,
and a guy called Mooks but I never met him.
We've been after that Daley for years,
just no one wants to talk.
You just can't tie it to me, Des.
I won't.
I promise.
So Marshall won't be joining us any more.
DALEY: As long as he remembers the rules.
What's this called again, Curtis?
He said Guinness Pineapple Punch, babe.
Guinness Pineapple Punch.
Don't have make some concoctions you lot.
What about Sam?
He's not gonna bite.
Maybe it's time to give him
a little more incentive.
- That's why you made me do it, right?
- (WHISTLES)
Poppy, come here.
I want you to do something for me.
I am not sucking your cock.
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.
(SIGHS)
What's up?
Did you get the club card?
Oh, uh, no, babe, it was crazy, yeah,
I couldn't even get to them.
Kids were crying,
women were climbing over stuff.
There were these two women fighting,
I swear, I see titties fall out and everything.
They just popped out. (MAKES POPPING SOUND)
- Sounds awful.
- It was.
(DOOR CLOSES)
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Where are the kids?
Want to tell me about this?
Girl just left it, said I should watch it.
Just turn it off.
Why would you do this to us?
- Please just turn it off.
- I want to finish watching it.
- Turn it off!
- No!
Get off! Get off me!
Get off me!
(PANTING)
Get off me.
I'm sorry.
Were you sorry when your cock was inside her?
(# RAP MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing?
- No, it's all right...
- No, you can't come in here.
Listen, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, listen.
The neighbours just complained
about too much noise.
Oh, what a coincidence
seeing all you lot here.
Well, since we're here we're wondering
if we could step inside
and have a little chat about a few things.
Like what?
A young man named Marshall Brevitt,
who we know you're associated with,
well, he ended up in A&E today.
You know anything about that?
Has he said anyone does?
No, the poor kid's having trouble speaking,
but he will though.
Don't you have anything better
to do, little girl?
Don't you, piggy?
Like shooting unarmed black men
so posh kids can loot shops
and let poor kids take the blame?
Well, maybe we think there's something
going on in here that we should know about.
DALEY: What's made you think that then?
Now as far as I can see
you ain't got a warrant
and you definitely ain't got
any evidence of anything untoward,
cos well there ain't nothing happening.
So... Evanesco.
- What?
- Never mind.
Just something they used to say.
Point is, you're trespassing
on private property,
little suggestion, I'd do one
cos Mooks won't like it.
Is that a threat?
Why doesn't Mooks tell us himself?
Oh, that's not a threat.
Get out of my house before I have you gutted
and spread on my sesame seed bagel.
That's a threat.
I'm going to get you, Daley.
Mooks, Hugs, Curtis.
I'm coming for you.
I look forward to it, son.
(# RAP MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)
You know the saddest thing?
I put so much into us.
All the people that said
not to give you a chance.
Am I just not good enough?
What's she got that's any better than me?
I fucking...
Oh!
They set me up.
I don't care if she fell off a rainbow
with a pot of gold,
pizza in each hand, legs spread,
beer coming out her arse.
Have some fucking respect
for yourself, for me,
the woman that's had your child
and does everything for this family.
For our little girl.
For your little boy that I raised as my own,
who had nightmares for six months
after playing in a room for hours
while his mum lay dead
with a needle in her arm.
Stop blaming other people for your fuck-ups.
You know it's funny you say
you want to protect this family,
who's gonna protect us from you?
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hugs.
Let's talk about the police
you brought to my house.
I didn't bring the police
to your house, Daley.
Uh, well, that Sam brought the police
to my house,
we know he did because
nobody we know would dare to.
Sam was here because of Curtis.
Curtis is here because of you,
so by default you brought the police
to my house.
Mooks ain't gonna be happy.
Well, tell me what you want done
to Sam and I'll do it.
If you want to draw this Sam out,
draw him out properly.
I'm done with the fucking games, Curtis.
He loves his family, hurt one of them.
Why you don't let me deal
with him the way I want?
The deal was I work for you,
you let me do what I want with him.
Listen.
Listen to me, you Planet of the Ape
monkey magic coon.
You said you'd do anything I want.
All you wanted was to get back
in the game and get this fucking Sam,
draw him out so he'd come for you.
Well, he come, and he broke my rules,
so now what I want is for you to find
one of his family and cut them.
Now you want the bad boy
he used to be, that'd do it.
Finish him like you said you would
or Mooks will finish you.
Do you understand me
or do I need to translate to fucking monkey?
(DOOR OPENS)

to take over, yeah?

You ready for war?
Go away.
Whatever happened to your white girl, Lexie?
I hear she overdosed
and they found her on the floor
with a vibrator in her arse.
I mean, that's what I hear.
It's not like I could have got people
to get out again.
How could I do that?
I was in my cell.
We's going to do this,
just let me know when.

Come on. Come on, come in here.

Tell me what happened.
Thank you.
I thought you said they took all your things.
They did, but I hid my phone,
it was instinct.
Well, they'll be gone now,
so, once you've finished your water,
I'll walk you out.
Thank you.

Hi, Mum.
Good morning, son, how are you today?
Yeah, I'm good, you?
Not bad.
I'm gonna go and see your brother in a while.
You all right?
Listen, I saw two men mugging a girl
outside on the walkway,
- so I let her come in for a bit.
- Why would you let her in?
I couldn't leave her outside.
What should I do?
- What does she look like?
- Sorry?
What does she look like?
Quite pretty, brunette.
Does she have an accent?
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- Hold on, it's the door going.
- I'll call you back.
- Mum, does she have an ac...
Mum!
What are you doing?
They used to treat me like the others,
but things are much better for me now.
What does that mean?
Don't you dare open that door.
I have to.
No!
(GASPING)
I have a little problem with your son.
And you think threatening his mother
- is going to get you what you want?
- You're right.
Threatening isn't going to do it.
Oh, my God!
No!
That should do it.
Hey. All or nothing, right?
We need to go. Get her.

We sent a unit to Daley's house.
They've all gone.
Sam.
Penny's pregnant.
There's something else.
Didn't know if this was gonna be
a good time to tell you,
cos I'm not sure when I'll see you again.
Penny's work visa for America came through,
so we're moving out there.
Connecticut.
We'd love to see you out there one day.
But I don't need to know what...
I know there's more going on here
than you're letting anyone know.
I wanna say I hate you.
I want to tell you I fucking hate you,
cos I don't understand how
Mum had to get involved,
but I don't.
You're my big brother.
So, if I could say anything to you now,
is that I want you to handle it,
cos that's the least Mum
and the rest of us deserve.
(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

(SOBS)
- What you doing?
- I'm gonna go back to my mums.
Got some fresh clothes for the kids.
What?
You thought because we had sex,
everything was forgotten?
Well, what was it then?
It was about me loving you,
despite myself loving you,
but for the sake of me and my kids,
I'm not coming back into this mess.
Baxter's my son.
Well, you can have me
arrested for kidnapping,
because I'm not bringing that little boy back
into whatever it is you're involved in.
So, when all of this is over,
when you can look me in the eye
and say it's done,
I'll think about coming back.

Isn't he moving to America though?
Yeah, but he'll be back.

Maybe I want to go solo.
And how can I miss the bargain

Are you lying to me?
Babe, come on, my little blackberry.

I do art. I like to draw comics.

Don't give up.

Do it independently, just don't do this shit.

- Who's cool?
He's cool, he's cool, he's cool!
Me and Carl were just having a conversation.
My wife does designing.
If you need anything just message me.
I'm not him, you know,
I don't want to ever see you near me again.
I hear you're jamming with Daley and Curtis,
you're gonna get what they get.
I hear you're around Mooks, you're gonna
get what he gets, you understand me?
Bro, that's not a problem.
I don't even know Mooks.
Never seen him in my life.
None of them have seen them.
Furthermore I'm starting to wonder
if he's even real.
Did you get what you need?
Yeah.
Might need some help on this one though.
I swear I heard you call me
a friend in there.
No, man, you must be mad.
- No, I think I did.
- You're smoking.
You're driving.

You didn't get to cut me, did you, bitch?
Armed police! Police! Clear! Nobody move.
Armed police. Down on the floor. Down, down.
Armed police, no one move.
OFFICER: Ambulance, one male,
with stab wounds to the chest,
unconscious, not breathing.
One detained. I repeat, one detained.
We know you weren't there by accident,
they're trying to tie you to a few things.
The kid you nail-gunned is in hospital,
wants to press charges.
The girl you punched, claimed she's a victim
of sex traffic and you're involved.
We also acquired some CCTV footage
of the day your mum died.
They were all on it, with Curtis,
so at best they think
it's a premeditated revenge attack.
DESMOND: I'm the only reason
you're not already in a cell.
I know the people that know the people
that can make all of this go away,
but we want Curtis.
Daley, Mooks.
Get me one, or all of them, this disappears.
Hey, no heroics.
You know where they are, you call us.
You might want to think of your family.
I am thinking about my family.
I've known you since we were 11 years old.
I'm telling you this as a friend.
This is your last chance.
We done?
(VIBRATING)
Yo, Hugs, let's get rid of that
fucker Daley, yeah?
Daley got away and the one
with the knives is dead.
So how do you want to do this?
West London waste ground,
in one hour.
Just you and me.
SAM: You happy?
CURTIS: Not yet.
I want you to lose everything
like I lost everything.
What the fuck did you lose?
I lost everything.
Lexie.
Kayla's left me, my kids,
my brother's leaving, my mum's dead.
I lost Trevor.
And I can't take that back.
For 16 years I've wished I could.
If I had one wish, that's all I'd do,
bring back your nephew.
He was like my son,
and then you came along.
The only way you leave here today
is by killing me. (CHUCKLES)
I'm not doing that.
I mean look at us, what are we doing?
Two black men just fighting
in the street again.
You don't kill me, I'll kill you.
If you wanted to do it,
why didn't you just do it?
- Why all of this?
- Because I wanted to earn it!
I wanted the bully that killed my Trevor,
because if he doesn't get to that gun
before me,
after I've killed him
I'm going to kill his family as well.
(GRUNTS)
Listen, I'm not trying to...
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
- (BONES CRACK)
- (SCREAMS)
(PANTS)
(SCREAMS)
Is this what you want?
Be careful what you wish for, cuz.
Finish me.
(SCREAMS)
Jeez!
Stay the fuck away from my family.
(GROANS)
(GUNSHOT)
Armed police! Armed police, get down!
DESMOND: Secure the weapon, secure the area.
Sam, you need to leave right now.
I told you to tell us where they were,
not have us follow you around.
- Hey.
- You are fucking nicked!
Hey, we promised, that's enough.
No, only if he told us where they were.
- I didn't promise anything.
- Rude boy. Rude boy.
The commissioner gave us the orders.
We know exactly what the role was,
- we've got our guy.
- I don't care. This is bullshit.
- Manor Road...
- Thank you.
- We don't need to arrest him.
- I'm taking him down.
I'm taking him down.
DESMOND: You're not taking
anyone down, all right.
(CURTIS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
DESMOND: Come on move, secure the perimeter.
PARKINSON: Man, this is bullshit.
Sam, run!
(GRUNTS)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
I want to know how you thought you were
gonna get away with this?
What you think you can have my mom killed,
you can hurt my brother,
you can threaten my fucking family
and I'm not going to do nothing?
Are you dizzy, blud?
What?
Never mind me.
It's just something I used to say.
That was all Curtis.
I can get you Curtis.
He told me how to find you.
- I can give you money.
- I don't want your fucking money.
Then what the fuck do you want?
Because I've seen your type before, mouth,
now you're not going to do anything to me
because if you do, you know,
you'll never see your family again.
So either start talking
or get the fuck out of my place
and we'll leave this where it is.
You're right.
I'm not going to do anything.
Even though I want to,
even after everything you did,
because you know what,
I love what I have too much to risk it.
You know what?
Not everyone's like me.
Hey, Daley.
Or should I call you Mooks?
You're so fucked.
(GUN COCKS)
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)
Mum.
Daddy!
(LAUGHS)
(SINGING INDISTINCTLY)
Would you like anything else?
Just the bill please.
So look, um...
I'm not perfect.
I'm just...
You know, I'm just one of those guys.
I'm not going to fuck us up again.
I just need to know that you're my guy.
If I know that,
I'll ride for you every step of the way.
There's nothing more important to me
than you and the kids.
Nothing.
And so all of the drama,
is it done?
Let's go. Let's go, come on.
- Daddy, funny.
- Let's go.
Ah, man.
(MAN SINGING)
OK, go listen to this guy.
Go, go, let's go...
Sam.
Just cleaning up some last little bits.
So this isn't a coincidence, is it?
No, no coincidence.
I knew you were here.
So what, are you here to take me in,
in front of my family?
I'm standing here after all these years
and I'm thinking about where our lives are,
and I'm thinking about how things seemed
so much bigger when we were young,
yet by actually doing this job
I see it meant nothing.
That...
That's all that means anything.
You're free to go.
I make a promise, I keep it.
Friends or not, you will not be getting
any more chances from me,
do you understand?
I don't want to see you again...
Unless,
Kayla makes that apple crumble
for my birthday, I wouldn't miss that.
Be good.
Come on. Come on, buddy.
Yeah, babe.
Yeah.
It's done.
