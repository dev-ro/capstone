Come on, move it, let's
go men, come on!
Go, go, faster, let's
go, men, come on, quick!
Do you
see anything?
Not a thing
What's
the alert for?
We'll find out.
Channel one is common,
channel two is for officers,
channel three is for command.
Report to the common channel.
Roger that.
You have multiple
hostiles approaching,
three kilometers away
and closing.
Any details?
They have a
heat signature,
and they're moving at
20 kilometers an hour.
They're much bigger
than a person.
What the hell are they?
They're the enemy, soldier.
What do you do with the enemy?
I kill them, Major.
Exactly, so be prepared.
Yes, sir.
So what do you really
do for a living?
I already told you.
Oh, come on, really.
Seriously.
All right, okay, you
voluntarily enlisted?
I sure did.
Come on, our military
has gotten better,
but not that much better.
Also, what are you doing
in Moscow then?
You're hanging out,
picking up girls all
over the place.
I'm on leave for two weeks,
I've been in for a year.
And?
Don't be confused
by the fancy restaurant.
I can afford it, my
family's rich.
My father has his own
plant in Samara.
He served for 15 years,
after that he went on to
start his own business.
Also, my brother was
special forces.
He was in Syria.
So, you made the decision
to honor the family legacy.
Well, you could say that.
Where did you serve?
The 45th Special
Forces Airborne Brigade.
Oh, Airborne?
So, did you go parachuting?
Of course, it's Airborne.
Tough guy, huh?
Cool!
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're beginning our descent.
We'll arrive at the
airport in 18 minutes.
Please return to your seats
and prepare for landing.
- Return your seat back...
- I just can't believe
- how beautiful it is there.
- to the upright position,
- You see, I can't wait...
- Fold up your meal tray.
- to go back there...
- Open your window blind,
- And see it all again.
- Lower the armrests
of your seat and please
fasten your seatbelt.
Fasten your seatbelts.
What is that?
I don't know, but I think
it's something serious.
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled TV program
to bring you this emergency
broadcast announcement.
We've lost contact
with the majority
of Russia's most
populated areas.
At this point, EMERCOM
centers haven't reported
any natural disasters.
We have not been informed either
if there are any physical
damages to structures.
God, Oleg, she's so scared.
Investigating
the possibility
of a nuclear attacks.
Did they say nuclear attacks?
Maybe it's a war?
Are today's events
just a series of accidents
or is this the result
of an attack?
Some experts assume
that terrorists may be
responsible for these events.
I don't understand,
what are they saying?
More questions remain
to be answered.
Some experts assume
that terrorists may be
responsible for these events.
Government authorities
ask that you remain calm.
I'm calling my father.
Okay, we've just
received a message.
It's not just Russian cities,
we have lost contact with
the rest of the world.
There is no response
at this time
from any phones, telegraphs,
radios, or internet sites.
All telecommunications
have been compromised.
Please stay tuned, we
are trying to learn more
as these events unfold.
Base, this is
Bro One, ETA four minutes.
This is a quick recon mission.
Our immediate target
is a large town
we have recently lost
contact with.
We've sent drones there,
none of them have returned.
Kolya, the first thing you
do is check radiation levels.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir!
All right, press!
Miss, don't go anywhere,
always remain behind the
soldiers at all times.
Try to keep your head down.
Don't make any noise,
don't say a word.
Major, we're
almost there.
I can't see anything,
there's no light.
There's a line, I
see a highway.
It's like it's been cut off.
It's starting, what do
they call it?
Quarantine.
This entire area has
been closed off.
We're right over
the town, we're landing.
Bro One,
this is Orlan One.
Do you read me?
Over.
This is Bro
One, loud and clear, over.
We're moving in,
cover us.
Copy that,
over and out.
She's been dead for
a few hours.
How did they all die?
Let's move out.
Let's search that building.
Bro One,
this is Orlan One.
We'll search the building
and come back.
Prepare for pick up
in 30 minutes.
Orlan One,
copy that.
You can move on in, the
street is clear.
Look at all this.
Dinner is on the table.
You see, it happened suddenly,
it caught people off guard.
This family was about
to have dinner,
the cashier, the customers,
also the drivers
behind the wheels.
Where are they then?
Where's who?
You said the family
was about to have dinner.
Where are they?
He took my rifle.
Fire, everybody, fire!
Hold your fire!
I don't get it, we had
to have hit him.
I was shooting right at him.
What was that?
Who the hell knows?
It was just a silhouette.
Yes.
Was it human?
Yes.
Kolya got lucky,
the vest caught all the bullets.
All his ribs are broken.
We need to carry him.
The chopper is on its way.
Let's go.
Don't worry, Kolya,
it'll be all right.
What matters is it didn't
get through the vest.
You'll be fine.
Hey, did you get to
see the shooter?
No, he came out of nowhere.
He took my rifle and
blinded me with a light.
I couldn't see anything.
He just started shooting.
Major, I have
HQ on the line.
HQ, come in.
This is Major Dolmatov,
C.O., Recon Team Seven.
We're returning to base.
There were no survivors
among the civilians.
We encountered an
unidentified hostile
in the quarantine zone.
It's been almost a month
since we've lost contact
with the quarantine zone.
More than one million
Russian citizens
are still considered
to be missing.
This information hasn't
been confirmed as of yet.
Meanwhile, the
authorities advise
that all citizens remain
calm and stay in their homes.
The government has no plans
to expand the quarantine
zone at this time.
However, the authorities'
appeals have been ignored
by some people of faith.
Thousands of Muslims have
gathered at Red Square today
in anticipation of the
upcoming end of the world.
Followers of the
Christian Orthodox Faith
gather in churches.
And a procession bearing
crosses marched
down New Arbat today.
Due to these occurrences,
the capital's authorities
advise you not to give in
to the panic and remain calm.
Yura, what
are they saying?
Nothing, Mom.
Everything's fine, life goes on.
Where's my lipstick?
Help me get ready.
Where are you going?
To the store.
Dad will be home soon,
and we have no food.
There's no need, Mom,
I already bought it.
The fridge is fully stocked,
don't worry.
Take this.
What's this?
Your pills, Mom.
What pills?
Mom, you take these every day.
Call your father.
Please tell him to be
home on time.
Mom, Dad died three years ago.
I'm off to work, I'll
be back late.
You need anything, call Sveta.
Sveta lives next door to us.
Do you remember her?
I asked him this morning,
"When will you be back?"
All right, take care.
Welcome to the new.
Your dreams and dreams and
dreams are our reality.
Dreams, Virtual Love
Chamber is waiting for you.
At your disposal there
are more than 1,000.
Hold it, kid!
Welcome to the new.
Luck Eight, good
morning, this is Dagger Four,
we're approaching the perimeter.
Permission to land?
Over.
Dagger
Four, permission granted,
proceed to Pad Two.
Copy that, landing.
And a
good morning.
We won't begin for
another 2 hours.
Attention,
soldiers!
At ease, soldiers.
Let me introduce myself,
Lieutenant Colonel Osmolovskaya,
Main Intelligence Directorate.
I apologize if I've come
at a bad time.
Hope everyone's put
their pants on.
And what if we haven't?
Then you'll listen
with a bare ass.
As we all know, something
happened 24 days ago,
and all contact was lost
with most of the world.
As such, the entire
quarantine zone is suddenly
in a total blackout.
Everything outside
this circle is
in complete darkness as of now.
It has been brought to
my attention,
that the majority of this
circle of life is located
in Russia, most of Finland,
Estonia,
Latvia, Belarus and Ukraine.
Recon teams sent out
along the inner edge
of the quarantine reported
similar situations
in all the populated areas.
We've had dead civilians and
several altercations reported
with an unidentified hostile.
One of the teams brought
some bodies back.
Autopsies showed that the
cause of death in each case
was poisoning by
endogenous neurotoxins,
as in, chemicals produced
by the human body.
Are you trying to
say that all the bodies
within this circle of life
just went ahead and
poisoned themselves?
Not me, the facts.
Our primary objective
is to collect
all the necessary data for
our scientists,
so they can properly determine
the nature of these events.
Our secondary objective
is to move deeper
into the quarantine zone.
The country's resources
are extremely limited.
We need to get our
territory back.
Having said that, we have to
be very careful as we proceed,
because there's more bad news.
Five recon teams that
were deployed deep
into the quarantine
zone are MIA.
I think many of you know this.
I heard from the guys
that some teams vanished,
toward the Kirov Region.
But I doubt you heard
that an entire company
of tanks was sent toward the
Kirov Region on the first day.
An entire company, along
with 70 tanks,
all contact
was lost.
This outpost is situated
at the very edge.
And most of the recon teams
that leave from here
do come back.
But everyone who's gone
deeper in hasn't returned.
We need to figure out why.
EMERCOM is taking
forever again.
I think we got a
medical supply delivery.
I don't like these woods.
It feels like someone is
always watching us from there.
Wish we had a flamethrower.
Hello, soldiers!
Looks like you're all
set with medicine now.
We brought you a doctor, too.
Where can we settle in?
Alyona?
Do you know her?
Take cover, Alyona, quick!
HQ, channel one is common,
channel two is for officers,
channel three is for command.
Report to channel one.
Roger that.
You have multiple hostiles
approaching from three
kilometers away and closing.
Any details?
They have a
heat signature,
and they're moving at
20 kilometers an hour.
They're much bigger
than a person.
Attention, strong
electromagnetic radiation
has been detected.
Everybody, hold
your positions!
Stay put, don't move!
The targets are closing in.
Major, they're
headed toward you.
500 meters.
Get ready!
300 meters.
150 meters.
Fire!
At five
o'clock this morning,
a military outpost in the
Kirov region was attacked.
The attack wasn't carried
out by a group of people,
but rather a group of
wild animals on a rampage.
- It's hard to believe...
- Men, we have another one!
But these facts
speak for themselves.
And this is what we
are up against.
- Check this out!
- There are casualties.
Live, from the outpost, Olya.
Come on.
And, up.
How are you, brother?
I thought we'd lost you.
Damn, it's really you, huh?
I thought I'd dreamt it
when I was out.
It's a small world,
especially now.
I would have never
thought you'd be a doctor.
You didn't tell me then.
Well, I didn't want to
ruin such a great night.
I know guys tend to
think that girls
in general are vulnerable.
All right, no hairline
fractures, which is great.
This looks very good, too.
Does this hurt?
Nah.
I'm sorry, I know it hurts,
but I had to examine it.
Watch your head.
Joint injury and a hematoma.
So, you're the Chief
of Medicine at the base?
Not even close.
The chief is from Burdenko.
He spent the morning
dissecting a bear.
I can't wait for them
to get it out of here.
It's insane.
Tell me about it.
You're on bed rest now,
but don't worry, you'll be
back in the barrack very soon.
I might drop by later
tonight for a check up.
How could
hundreds of bears
deliberately attack the outpost?
I know someone who
could help us get
to the bottom of this.
Well, I'd really like
to meet that person.
Have you heard
about the Sensors?
Are you talking
about the people
who supposedly got superpowers
after the primary events?
The Sensors do exist.
I actually studied them.
They don't bend spoons
or move glasses,
they're not superheroes.
But, they know
something we don't.
Their minds receive data
like radios receive signals.
However, we can't
decipher the data.
We don't know how they
became this way, either.
I've selected the strongest one,
but he was hurt during
the primary event.
He's in a military
hospital right now.
His abilities could be
useful to us.
Who are you?
I'm Zhenya, I was sent by Id.
And who is that?
You can ask questions later.
But listen carefully.
The first wave destroyed
all electronics.
The second launched the
self destruction
of all biological organisms.
The third one will make
anyone still alive
in the quarantine
zone attack us.
But, that hasn't happened yet.
We have time to stop it
from happening.
What do you mean?
Tell me who's out there.
There are 160
million of them.
People?
Not really.
Their free will is
completely gone.
And it'll never come back,
which makes them more dangerous.
However, Id knows how
to stop them.
And you will help him.
You'll help find the
one who controls them.
You must have seen him.
I don't want this.
I don't want this.
Leave, get out of here now!
Somebody, get him out of here!
Are you all right?
Arrest him!
How did he get in here?
Why'd you let him in?
Who?
What are you talking about?
This guy, are you
messing with me?
I'll get the doctor.
What's happening?
What the hell is happening?
Captain, but there's no
one else in here but us.
I didn't need to get
inside the hospital.
All I had to do was
get in there.
I think he's hallucinating.
He says someone else
is in the room.
I feel like I'm
hallucinating.
You're lucky you passed out.
It was ugly out there.
They aren't easy to kill.
No shit.
And we have no clue who's
in the quarantine zone.
It definitely wasn't a
bear that took Kolya's gun.
That's true.
How's your mom?
She's not answering me.
I asked a neighbor to
check in on her.
She says my mom's fine.
How's your family?
They stayed in Samara.
My parents...
I had a bad fight with Mom then.
She didn't want me to go, she
always hated the military.
How come?
My brother died in
combat in Syria.
Dad always compared me to him.
He raised him, and I'm
the mamma's boy.
So, I decided to prove him
wrong and went to serve, too.
Mom couldn't accept my brother's
death, and there I was.
When it all began a month
and a half ago,
I tried calling them, but
it was too late.
We never spoke again.
How are you feeling,
Sergeant?
A combat medic, huh?
Who would've thought?
Was that a compliment?
You tell me.
I'm getting ready to change
your friend's bandages.
It won't look pretty.
Will you excuse us?
All right, that
sounds serious.
How are you?
I'm fine.
I've just signed
your three-day leave
pass for Moscow.
You'll see a physical
therapist for three days
and be as good as new.
All right, let's
prepare to move out.
Everyone, get to your positions.
Let's do it.
Raven One, ready.
Raven Two, ready.
Raven Three, ready.
Vulture One, ready.
Vulture Two, ready.
Bastard One, ready.
Bastard Two, ready.
Hello, boys.
Good evening, ma'am.
Say hello to Moscow for me.
Have a good time for me.
Not with my leg!
I don't know what to say.
Why am I here?
Yes.
Because it's my military duty.
I want to help, to be
a part of all of this.
Do you have any rage?
Any desire to get revenge?
So many people have died.
Most of the population is
gone, we've all lost someone.
I didn't have anyone.
Well, except for my mother.
She's in Moscow, she's alive.
What did you do
before all of this?
I worked, cab driver.
Seriously?
Can you turn off the camera?
I don't want to say
this on camera.
I have a different opinion
about this whole thing.
I don't want to lie to people.
Well, can you tell me?
I want to know.
Perhaps I don't mind
that this happened.
In my case, it gave my
life meaning.
I was nobody as a civilian,
and here, I make a difference.
Don't you feel sorry
for the people?
No, I don't know them.
I bet you don't care, either,
unless your loved ones got hurt.
Only 0.5% of the
population survived.
That means that for every
survivor, there are 1,000 dead.
I'm one out of 1,000,
just like all of you.
Approaching checkpoint.
Prepare for deployment.
There's
total devastation ahead,
the convoy cannot move
any further at this point.
I see destroyed tanks,
one's turret was blown off.
The third wave has
already begun.
The recent footage from
the destroyed tank unit,
which was sent out to
study the quarantine zone
has completely
shocked the public
and led to a new wave of panic.
We repeat, please
back away from this area!
Even though there are no signs
of enemy presence or
any direct impact
at this precise moment.
Many experts are
fully convinced...
That we are currently in
a state of war.
The armored unit was
destroyed by weapons,
and clearly, someone
controlled those weapons.
Therefore, we have an enemy.
Frankly, this is a new
form of warfare
that hasn't been used before.
That makes this whole series
of events even scarier.
There's a chance the
government is hiding
who we're really fighting.
The only possible result of
this unfortunate situation
is complete panic and
total chaos.
Obviously, things aren't easy
for those who have survived.
People don't know
what to expect,
many have stopped going
to work altogether.
The situation is
worsening for us all.
I don't think it was
this bad even in the '90s.
I can't go outside without
fear of being robbed.
The
authorities say nothing,
they just keep sending
more soldiers.
Why won't they tell
us the truth?
We are people and we
are terrified.
The crime rates
continue to rise
at an absolutely alarming rate.
There are increasing
reports of store robberies.
As the population
descends into panic,
grocery stores are
being pillaged,
looting huge stockpiles of
food, and other sub supplies.
The population is going
utterly out of control.
Supreme High Command's
official position is
that we are currently fighting
a large unknown group of people.
After all that we've witnessed,
it is safe to assume they have
been using weapons they found
in the quarantine zone.
Considering the size
of the area,
the number of military bases,
and so on,
we believe they have access
to nearly every kind of weapon.
However, we haven't
detected movement
of any military hardware.
Therefore, we're preparing a
series of special operations.
We must take control of the area
and move deeper into the
quarantine zone
to determine the
location of the enemy
and their approximate number.
We have small recon teams
who will take on the mission.
Should they make contact
with the enemy,
reinforcements and additional
troops will be deployed
from our base of operations.
It will not be an easy mission.
They are to secure a foothold
and set up an observation post.
We will set up communications
and supply lines,
and they will remain
in the quarantine zone.
We can no longer afford
to sit and wait.
We must act quick,
despite the high risk
and potential danger.
HQ, this is
Explorer Seven,
we're 10 kilometers away
from the checkpoint.
Copy that,
hear you loud and clear,
Explorer Seven.
What if we run
into someone?
Why do you ask?
I want to know what to do.
In your case, scream.
Yeah, and in your case?
Do you want to go back
before we get too far?
Huh, you want to go back?
Tell me!
Lieutenant, relax, she
didn't mean anything.
We're all stressed.
It's okay.
Where's your helper guy?
The cameraman?
He went to Moscow to
see his family.
I can handle the camera.
Petrov, hold this.
Come here.
What about you?
Don't you have a
family to go to?
I guess I don't.
Put me down.
This is a small village.
Let's clear every house
before we dig in.
Then, we can choose the
best location.
Turn on the local channel.
Team One take the left side,
Team Two take the right.
What's wrong, Senchuk?
Spread out, keep your eyes open.
Did you see them?
There was no one, I
opened the container,
and this shit fell out, dammit!
Are you serious?
We need to take it out.
Take it out?
Wait, wait a minute,
don't do that!
It's getting dark, we should
continue this in the morning.
Let's find a good spot
to keep watch.
Let's move toward that building.
It provides a good view.
Check every door.
If they're unlocked or broken
into, check the apartments.
What are they doing?
It's a tracking radar, it
sees people through walls.
Like in Predator.
Clear.
Where do we go?
Ninth floor, it has
roof access,
so we can rappel down
if we need a quick exit.
Clear.
Major, Team Two
is clearing their location.
Team Four is in position.
Did they send a doctor?
He's leaving tomorrow.
Team Seven is
in Kirov on recon detail.
Who's the Lieutenant in Seven?
Kasatkin.
That's the one with the girl.
Yes, sir.
Make sure to keep
an eye on them.
Explorer Four,
come in.
Explorer Four here,
over.
We're approaching.
Copy that.
Alyona!
Yes.
So they sent you?
Yes, hi.
Ow.
Sorry.
Where is he?
Inside.
Come, we need help.
You did a good job cleaning
the wound, for a soldier.
Thanks a lot.
I still need to
bring him in, it's deep.
Wait a minute, bring me in?
It's not that deep.
Give me some painkillers,
and I'll dance for you.
Whatever you want.
Don't bring me in, they
need me here.
That is your call, of
course, you're the boss.
Sorry, man.
If it gets infected,
we'll need to amputate.
Freaking cripples.
Olya, get up.
How did you sleep?
Surprisingly well.
Is everything okay?
Yes, it's all quiet.
Sorry, I decided to wake you up.
Your breakfast is getting cold.
What, do we have
something hot?
It'll be the
best hot breakfast ever.
Hello.
Good morning.
It smells so good.
Have a seat.
It's good.
Do you always eat like
this in the Army?
Mm, it's just canned beef.
You wouldn't eat
this back home.
Here, when you're at
death's doorstep,
food tastes different.
And I would say the
same goes for sex.
I'm gonna have to take
your word on that one.
Listen, Mr. Pickup Guru,
your turn to watch the window.
Olya, Did you film when we
were approaching the building?
I did, why?
Let me see.
Which one is from last night?
Look, the door to the
store was closed.
Son of a bitch.
Could be the wind.
If the wind closed it,
sure, but it wouldn't open it.
I'm glad you're
feeling better.
Who are you?
Zhenya told you about me.
My name is Id.
I'm hallucinating
again.
I'm really here.
Zhenya only had a
mental connection.
I had connected your minds then.
We don't have much time, Sasha.
You were on the border
during the first wave.
You didn't become a slave,
but you're no longer a
regular human.
You're different.
You can find the one who
controls them.
You saw him, didn't you?
I did.
I didn't see his face, but I
know who you're talking about.
It was a dream.
Where is he?
I don't know, I can't
help you, got it?
You must come
with me now.
Sasha!
Step away from him, Sasha!
Who is that?
We have an intruder!
What do you see?
Clear, there's no movement.
What are they saying?
Nothing yet.
The building is clear.
Someone was here.
Looks like they come
here for the food.
What do you think?
I say we regroup, can't
miss this opportunity.
Set up an ambush.
That's smart.
Do you have grenades?
Set the traps.
I will not repeat myself,
step away!
What the hell are you doing?
If he moves, take him down!
I didn't have to
resort to that,
but a short demonstration
of power is more effective
than a long explanation.
Do you think I could make
them pull the trigger?
That's right.
Millions just like me
will be here soon.
They will all want the
same thing, to destroy you.
All of you.
I'm on your side.
We don't have much time,
but if you hear me out,
I'll try and convince you.
You're not human.
Who are you?
In your language,
I'm what you'd call a god.
I'm ready to answer all
your questions,
but we're running out of time.
Kolya,
what do you see?
Nothing.
I don't think we'll
see them today
if they already got their food.
How's it going?
It's going.
I don't understand
everything that's happening.
I'm trying to describe
it to the lieutenant.
I see.
What about your husband?
Is he worried you're
here, on the front line?
We have a complicated
relationship.
How come?
Sometimes, the love is gone,
but people are afraid
to break up.
And sometimes, it goes
on for too long.
Men, I see movement.
I think it worked.
- We're moving out.
- Okay.
What about me?
- Do I...
- You stay here.
If a firefight breaks out,
and we don't answer on the
radio, I need you to use this.
There are two signal
flares, purple and red.
Purple means we were
attacked and need help.
And the red one?
Red equals dead.
Team is destroyed and
don't expect help.
Here!
Holy shit.
He's alive.
Check for fractures.
What's happening?
Teenager, about 14, set off
the tripwire, limbs intact.
What the hell?
Is he alone out here?
Put the camera away.
I said there could be
civilians here, all right.
Did you hear me?
Put it away!
I heard you.
Hey, be quiet.
He looks fine, let's take him.
Are you saying
it's all due to some radiation
that apparently turned
160 million people
into mindless alien puppets?
To put it simply, yes.
I was supposed to give the order
to begin the irradiation process
once the moon was
above the ocean.
But, I gave the order
when the moon covered
this part of the planet.
The radiation didn't reach it,
that's why the circle of
life appeared.
Those beyond the circle
no longer have control
over their own minds.
They simply follow orders,
like drones.
Soon, they'll gather around
the circle and attack you.
It will begin the third
wave of colonization.
Why do you
need our planet?
Our star was
doomed to burn out.
We looked for a new
place to live.
Your planet is perfect, your
sun is a relatively young star.
This planet will be
habitable for a long time.
So in other words,
you want to destroy us?
And that's why you need
the colonization waves.
Actually, there was
also a wave number zero.
According to our race's
colonization system,
wave zero is a biological attack
that was supposed to
subdue the planet
while the ships were on the way.
Who do you
guys have here?
Cover us.
Our solar system is
quite a distance from yours.
I don't understand.
Since our
colonization ship is unable
to travel at light speed,
we first send a smaller ship
with bio weapons
through hyperspace.
It is capable of reaching
the target almost instantly.
Then, the armada moves out.
By the time the armada
arrives in 200,000 years,
the planet is ready for
new inhabitants.
So you're saying they're
only coming in 200,000 years?
No, they arrive tomorrow.
What have we here?
Didn't the recon team say
there was no one out there?
He has barotrauma, or
maybe just a concussion.
It's not too bad, we can help
him, I'll get the med kit.
Here, drink this.
How are you?
What happened?
I went to the store.
What do you remember?
I just went inside
the store to get food.
I do it almost every night.
Go on.
I didn't know anyone
else survived.
I thought everyone
else was dead.
Son of a bitch!
Had enough war, did you?
Fuck off.
How are the others doing?
I'm not sure, but I
think they're fine.
Be careful, okay?
You too.
Attention, movement detected.
This wave number zero,
the biological attack.
Did you prevent it?
Or did it just fail?
On the contrary,
it worked very well.
Our weapons are perfect.
Once it reaches the planet,
it starts spreading,
attacking all forms of
life present.
It either destroys them
or enslaves them.
That is how we first got rid
of the Earth's
developed species.
You mean us?
You don't actually think
that people built the pyramids?
And the underwater cities?
What are you saying?
Don't worry.
Look, what's your name?
Styopa.
I'm Maxim.
Are you in charge?
Yes, I'm a lieutenant,
I'm in charge here.
We will take you up to...
Mankind itself
is our weapon.
You are our perfect invaders.
The perfect virus.
You wiped out the original
population, making room for us.
Look how alike we are.
Two races from
different solar systems
can't be this similar.
We have the same DNA.
So, we are you?
God created man in
His own image.
But, to be specific,
you're the product of
our genetic engineering.
You're a truncated
version of us.
We took away your
psionic abilities.
We gave you your drive to mate,
which awoke your
primal instincts.
Combined with your
emotions and mortality,
this results in your need
to procreate thoughtlessly
and vigorously.
This way, the virus
spread faster.
As a result, you
completed the mission
thousands of years sooner
than expected.
Men, I repeat,
what is happening?
The Lieutenant was killed.
What? By whom?
The injured kid we
picked up, son of a bitch.
What kid?
Where is he?
The Lieutenant
is gone and so is the kid.
Get off the channel!
What the hell?
He was just a young kid.
Eyes open, eyes open.
I see a group of people.
How many?
A lot, and
they're armed.
You lack mercy
and compassion.
You're driven solely by
procreation and violence.
When it comes to destroying
lives, there's no one like you.
Movement detected.
That is why waves
one and two were supposed
to take you out, leaving
only the slaves.
Otherwise, you won't stop
until you destroy
absolutely everything.
Where are
the shots coming from?
From everywhere.
Suppressive fire!
Alyona, Alyona!
Hide, come, let's take cover!
No, he's hurt!
No, stop!
Let's get out of here,
now, now!
Stay there, lie still.
Radio in the attack,
one injured!
Yes, sir!
How is he?
Fragment wound, but no
signs of internal bleeding.
Motherfucker!
Take cover!
Okay, let's get out of here!
Get in the building!
You alive?
For now!
Did you see where
they fired from?
From the building
across from us.
Ammunition exhausted
Son of a bitch!
Give me a
status report.
Lynx was taken out completely,
the resupply team can't return.
And the injured?
Unclear, requesting orders.
Olya, Olya, get back!
Take cover!
David, find the RPG.
I see you,
there you are.
Get down!
This is ridiculous.
You have to believe it.
Because the sooner you
accept the truth,
the better the chance you
have at winning.
Well, not you, us.
Us?
Aren't you with them?
You control them.
Not exactly.
I arrived on that ship
with the virus,
someone else was with me.
That was 200,000 years ago.
We were supposed to
supervise your development
and welcome our kind
when they arrive.
I was certain I was the
only survivor by now.
But, I suppose I was wrong.
Men, the tank's gone.
If you have any ideas,
now is the time.
Lavrin, do it!
Yes, sir!
Cover them!
Let's do it.
The one who controls
them, he's the same as you?
Exactly.
His name is Ra, he's
their master.
Together, they're a whole.
We must kill him.
Then I can take control of
them and neutralize them.
But, first I need to find
him, that is why I'm here.
Because of Sasha?
He can see Ra.
We must take him to the outpost,
close to the quarantine zone.
My assistant and I are
going with you.
What if everything you
told me is just a big lie
and you're on their side?
You must decide
whether to believe me or not.
Yes, I'm listening.
Yes, yes, all right,
I'm on my way.
Our recon teams were attacked.
They went on
the offensive.
We are wasting time.
They killed Petya.
Kolya is dead, too.
They're coming
from everywhere!
Let's regroup!
They're at
the entrance.
Hold the door.
Yes, sir.
Olya, the signal flare!
Where is that?
Which team?
Looks like Seven, in
the direction of Kirov.
The war has begun.
We got a mortar!
Olya!
Yes.
Come with me!
Let's go!
Here, let's go.
They retreated.
Hold the door.
They won't
be back soon.
They're like ants!
They're not afraid to die.
I took out like 40 of them!
We got a few, too.
Why are they attacking us?
We don't know that yet.
We have a bigger problem.
We need to get out of here.
David, get the rope ready.
We can fasten it to that corner.
Hopefully, they don't
have us surrounded.
Which is highly likely.
Can't we call anyone?
No, we have short-range
communication.
We launched the signal flare,
they know we need help.
I saw more of those down there.
How many?
About seven or eight
purple ones and three red.
What the fuck?
So does that mean they're
not going to come for us?
Well, I guess what that means
is we shouldn't count on it.
Looks like a major attack.
All right, we're on our own.
I'll take the rope.
David, be on the lookout,
they're too quiet.
Are you even mortal?
There's no such
thing as immortality.
But, I will live forever,
if no one kills me.
We can alter the
structure of our bodies,
renewing our cells.
So then are you able
to cure any disease?
Yes, for instance,
cerebral palsy.
I couldn't walk, I
didn't feel my legs at all.
And is that how you
buy loyalty?
I don't buy anything.
I help.
And Zhenya helps me of
his own free will.
That is the advantage we
have over slaves.
I'm glad to see you,
but to be honest,
I would have felt much better
if you had stayed behind.
Who is that?
They can help us,
it's a long story.
So what do you need to find
who you're looking for?
We need a quiet place
where Sasha can concentrate.
What do you see?
Nothing.
The bodies are still
there, no one removed them.
Perhaps they left?
That's unlikely,
they're regrouping.
Do we really need to leave?
We'll die if we stay.
There, we have a chance.
A small one, but a chance.
The commander's?
It was, he won't
need it anymore.
All right.
How far to the outpost?
We won't make it to
the outpost.
David, where'd you see
the red flares?
Two there
and one there.
All right, judging
from the location,
that was either Team Eight,
Nine, or 10.
Or Teams Five and Six here.
There were no flares there.
This is Team Three and Four.
I say, let's go that way,
that way is definitely closer.
Well, no red flares
doesn't necessarily mean
they're still alive.
You already know that.
Maybe, they had no time
to launch them.
Let's hope for the best.
Men, let's get down.
- Your foot.
- What's this?
Life-saving panties.
Let's say they're alive
and out there, just like us.
We won't make it there.
Judging from the map we have,
we're moving in the opposite
direction of the outpost.
First of all, we
outnumber them.
Second, their radio
might be working.
If not, we'll move on to
the next team,
then the next one after that.
The more of us are out there,
the better our
chances to survive.
No, I'm not
going there, no.
Yes.
Let's go.
It's easy, you don't do
anything, I lower you down.
Feet against the wall
and don't crowd the rope.
Understood?
- Yes.
- Let's go then.
I can't, I'm scared.
Calm down,
it's all right.
No, I can't do this,
no!
- Hey!
- No!
Let's go.
I will help you
get in the desired state.
Try to remember how
your dreams began.
First, you heard the
voices of his slaves.
Their conversations and orders.
Try to hear them now.
You must listen for the
one who controls them.
Listen.
Everything depends on
you and only you.
Hear his voice.
What's that?
I don't understand.
He's there.
He controls them from there.
I know where he is.
He's in Kirov.
Well done.
You did everything
you had to do.
We need to mobilize
everyone and move out.
Can anybody here tell me
what the hell's going on?
Lieutenant Colonel!
It's hard to explain.
You were invaded
by alien forces.
About 160 million
people have survived
outside the circle of life.
From day one, they've been
gathering towards the circle,
collecting weapons, grouping,
and preparing for war.
Are you from military
intelligence?
Shit!
How did you...
I'm what you'd
call an alien.
But, I'm on your side.
For now, we still have a
chance to turn things around.
And we must take this chance.
The enemy is controlled
by someone like him.
We must take him out or the
circle of life won't survive.
Major, Moscow is under attack.
The connection's weak, HQ
in Nizhny isn't responding.
They've penetrated, sir.
That means we're
almost out of time.
I'll explain it on the way.
They're not that scary.
Miss, please help us.
What happened?
We were captured.
We were here.
Let me record.
- David.
- I beg you, please.
No, no, no!
Keep her back.
No, please, no.
Did you forget the kid
who killed the Lieutenant?
Did you forget that?
They can pretend to be anyone.
I don't give a shit anymore.
Is that clear?
Men, grab the ammo and the food.
Get down!
Come on.
Motherfucker.
Son of a bitch.
Let's go.
Wait.
I have to tell you something.
Go.
He saw me.
He looked me in the eye, and
it was beyond terrifying.
I've never been that
terrified in my life.
Don't be afraid.
I won't let him get to you.
But, you'll be better off here,
all right?
It will be safer this way.
We'll try
to make it in 24 hours.
I hope this isn't all bullshit,
and we can stop the attack.
Hang in there.
We'll be
fine, Major, good luck!
Are you hurt?
We need to reach Team
Four somehow.
Preferably, by car.
Check the cars, find
one that runs.
It's running.
There's still half a tank left.
Find the first aid kit.
Is Sasha in the other car?
Ra saw Sasha and
now knows where he is.
Being near him is an
unnecessary risk now.
Stop the car now!
We're going back!
What's the problem?
Outpost is under
a guided missile attack!
I repeat, missile
attack incoming!
What the hell?
You saw this coming.
They're dead because of you.
Do you even want to win?
Not like this.
If Sasha were with us,
these missiles would hit us.
Then, mankind wouldn't
stand a chance.
The death of everyone at
the outpost was
a necessary sacrifice
to save everyone else.
It's a meat grinder.
Stay here.
Yura!
Oleg.
How did you know it was me?
Why didn't you shoot?
I ran out of ammo,
otherwise, I'd shoot you.
I figured you'd get closer,
and I'd twist your neck.
I bet I'd twist yours first.
I'm glad you're alive.
Just the two of you?
Yes.
Not too many here either.
Are these all that survived?
Oh, the press?
Welcome!
I'd get up, but I'm afraid
my guts would fall out.
Do you have
any ammo left?
One magazine left.
Comms?
Nothing with the
outpost or HQ.
The hell with it.
They're here, stop!
Stop all the vehicles.
I know it was terrifying.
It will be all right.
What about
the other teams?
Thanks for picking
us up at least.
We will not be taking you.
What?
We're going to Kirov.
We must destroy their command.
Back to that hellhole?
We just came from there.
We have civilians, a doctor,
a reporter, some injured troops.
Are we taking them all with us?
There's nowhere to go to.
The outpost is destroyed,
contact with command is lost.
The circle of life is
under attack.
They broke through, and
we're everybody's last hope.
Well, actually, he is.
Freeze!
Weapons down!
He's on our side.
All right, let's move out.
You're all asleep.
But you, Yura, woke up.
It's war.
It makes a person who
he's created to be.
You awoke to your true nature.
That's what makes you
stronger than the others.
You'll help me kill our
mutual enemy.
We're
entering the city.
Are you okay?
Do you think they're
going to take Moscow?
For all I know, we're
all that's left of mankind.
Why the hell are they
not attacking us?
He thinks I died
at the outpost.
And besides, the main force
is in the circle of life.
I'm trying to keep us
invisible to them.
But, the closer we get
to Ra, the weaker I get.
I'm sure he took measures
to protect himself.
Major, there
are armed civilians ahead.
Let's go, let's go!
Heading straight to
the skyscraper.
He will throw
everything he has at you.
I need time.
I'll take a few
soldiers and him.
All right, they'll
be here soon.
Everyone, get in position!
Civilians, now take cover
and stay there.
Did I miss something?
He ordered us to
guard the entrance.
We will fight till the end.
All right,
I'm here if you need me.
I'll make a bet and assume
it won't be a long battle.
I'm not much of a gambler.
Fire!
Move in!
RPG on the right!
Dammit, they're insane!
I warned you about
these freaks.
Then we're freaks, too.
Son of a bitch!
They're everywhere!
Please excuse me, but
it's time for me to go.
You fart too much in
here anyway.
We need to take a small team
to the neighboring building.
There we draw their fire!
Relay that!
They asked for time, we
give them time.
Team, let's move out!
All right, let's fall back!
Someone needs to cover us!
My team and I are
staying, you're in charge.
Oleg, go with them!
But, Major...
That's an order!
Let's go upstairs,
we're better off there.
And the others?
The others will cover
us from here.
But we can't...
We can or it's all
for nothing.
Move it!
Attention, soldiers!
Let's take as many of these
assholes with us as possible.
It's been an honor to
serve with you, men.
Likewise, Major.
Concentrate
all fire on that truck!
This is it.
Now.
Are there many others
like you on that ship?
Yes, many.
Does that scare you?
No.
Don't be afraid.
Everything is how it's
supposed to be.
What do we do next?
You'll do what
you were created for.
To kill.
Wars have always made
you stronger.
So much stronger, that
you became a threat to us.
Ra foresaw that
and made up a religion
for you based on love.
He hoped the wars would stop
and that mankind would
remain in a state of infancy,
with love for those around you
and a total lack of technology.
But, you turned
religion into a reason
for more war and
endless conflict.
You continued to
kill each other.
This is what you're made for.
The nature of a virus
always takes over.
You don't feel love,
compassion or mercy.
Ra created all that for you.
When they arrive, you'll
kill them all.
And I'll show you how.
But why now?
Why didn't you come sooner?
Before eight billion
people died!
You could've stopped
the radiation poisoning!
I could have.
But that would disrupted
the original plan,
and the ship would have gone
into its defensive mode.
Right now, they don't have a
clue, and we have a chance.
So for you, this is
nothing but numbers?
Human life is just math?
You let them kill
people for nothing,
just to make your plan work.
Just like you let everyone
die at the outpost.
Enough of you
have survived,
there's no need for more.
Really?
So you mean there's no
need for my parents?
There isn't.
Don't you understand?
You and your offspring
will be the beginning
of a new civilization.
For centuries, you believed
in someone you'd never seen.
But now, your god will
always be with you.
But you're not God!
You're the Devil right?
Sent here to destroy all of us!
I am the god you deserve.
Fuck off, leave us alone.
Put your gun away, moron.
We need him alive!
A million more like
him are coming.
How are you planning
to fight them?
With this gun?
I'd rather take my
chances with the gun
than let him mess with my head.
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
This is what I meant.
Even in the weakest of the
species, such as this one,
the urge to kill is strong.
Come here!
Oleg, no.
We don't stand a
chance without him.
Yura, don't you see...
No!
Do not disappoint me.
Hello, son.
Do you want to kill me?
Go ahead.
You already did it once
when you abandoned your
mother and me.
You will never be as good
as your brother.
Now we're definitely dead.
Where are they?
Why isn't anyone coming out?
Let's go.
Come on,
finish me off.
We're all going to die anyway!
They're all sleeping.
This is oxygen.
It flows through these pipes.
Soon they'll wake up.
I guess Ra was supposed
to wake them.
What are we gonna do?
Step back.
There's a timer.
We don't have enough time
or ammunitions.
Let's make sure they
don't wake up.
There's gravity everywhere!
This is the last one!
Dammit.
Olya, throw me the ax!
What are you waiting for?
Stop!
Are these children?
