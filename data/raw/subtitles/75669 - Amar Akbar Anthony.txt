- How are you, Gangubai?
- I am fine.
Look at your house. Your family
is starving, your wife has T.B.
You're back!
Bharati, what's happened?
They said you had T.B.
- Haven't you eaten?
- We haven't eaten for days.
Did Robert send you any money
while I was in prison?
No. Anyway, I wouldn't accept it
My children...
...won't be raised
on dirty money.
Where are you going?
Amar, my son
What's up?
I'm hiding this pistol,
or Anthony will take it
Take her away!
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Kishenlal, your driver.
Have you already
forgotten that day...
...you ran from the police
to my house.
Is Kishenlal in?
- Sir, why did you bother?
- It's important.
I had an accident.
I ran over a man. He's dead.
I want you to take the blame.
As a loyal employee, you must
protect your boss' interests.
Don't worry. I'll look
after your children.
I took all the blame
because of you.
I was imprisoned
in order to save you.
Because you promised
to look after my family.
That you would send them money.
You didn't send a penny,
let alone double the wages.
Is that your word?
Why is this whisky so bland?
I forgot the ice.
The ice? How would you recall
a poor man's plight?
Come to the point!
I have no time to waste.
I've come here empty-handed.
My wife has T.B.
My children are starving.
I'm not asking for my wages...
...l'm begging for help.
I have no time for beggars.
Get a job!
Why hesitate? There's dignity
in all honest labor.
You want money? You'll get it.
Like a mirror.
You said I hadn't sent
your family even an anna?
One anna?
Did you expect 10,000 rupees
for shining shoes?
Robert, you mock the
need of the poor.
It will cost you dear.
You're drunk
with wealth today.
Some day, I swear,
I'll sober you down.
To hurt me, you need more
bullets than you'll ever have.
Follow that car!
It's filled with gold.
- Where's your mother?
- She left this.
"I'm going to end my life"
"I don't want you to spend all
your money on my treatment...
...use it for the children.
Your Bharati"
Get in the car!
- Where are you going to?
- Robert's men are after me.
They'll be here any minute.
The children are in danger.
Bharati's gone,
now you're off too?
Where's Kishenlal going?
The house is empty.
Looks like Kishenlal escaped.
Amar, stay here.
I'll be right back.
Father, don't leave us.
Are you hungry? I'll go
and fetch something.
The car's on fire.
Get down. Hurry!
What happened?
We don't know.
No one must go down. Get it?
Call the ambulance!
And the fire brigade.
Kishenlal and his children
were in the car.
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?
Whose child is he?
God, Yours is indeed
a strange world.
People have children they can't
raise, so they abandon them.
Don't worry, my child.
I'll look after you.
Look, I brought food for you!
Sister, are you badly hurt?
Get up...
I can't see.
I want to die. Let me die!
It's a terrible sin
to commit suicide.
Others have a right
on your life, too.
That's probably why God
took away my sight.
I will drop you home.
Why is this child crying?
He was deserted near Borivali.
Allah may have wanted me
to raise the infant.
May God bless you both
and keep you well.
Here we are.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
Take care of yourself.
- What happened to you?
- I've lost my sight.
Where are my husband
and children?
They died in a car accident.
I saw it all with my own eyes.
It seems his mother
has committed suicide.
Due to poverty, his father
has deserted him.
Put him in the car safely.
Amar! Where are my
children?
Father, I want to confess.
I sold my school books.
There was a dead man on the
street, I paid for his funeral.
It isn't for you to do.
You should call the police.
I won't go to the police.
I look like a trouble-maker.
They'd put me in the lock-up.
That would be good.
You mean you'd want them to?
You're forever getting
into a fight.
Who did I hit?
You hit an innocent man.
You mean Peter? Don't talk
of him, Father.
He makes unlicensed liquor,
and pours gutter water in it.
You'd die in 2 instead of
20 years.
You sell honey, do you?
I have a license, Father.
And my liquor's unadulterated!
Try some!
You don't drink.
I say this as your guardian,
not as a priest.
Give this up!
Or I'll tell the police.
Then lodge a complaint...
...against her, too.
I give her half my earnings
for charity.
You're trying to bribe her?
How can I do that, Father?
Whatever she gives,
I give back 50% for the poor.
We made a deal, didn't we?
I care about the poor,
just as much as she does.
You're quiet?
One day, you'll talk.
Anthony! There's been an
accident outside.
- How did this happen?
- A hit and run case.
Don't stare, call a taxi!
There's been an accident.
Who's accident?
A lady's hit.
- Where is she?
- Nanavati Hospital.
I'm on my way.
There's no need to pretend.
You're perfectly all right.
Your stethoscope isn't working.
Put your hand on my heart.
You'll know how this heart,
this body, is aching all over.
My heart is a storehouse of pain.
So your songs are failures?
That's why you're playing patient?
To ease this aching heart,
I've come to invite you.
Nice place to give an invitation
Where else can we meet? I've
to pretend to be a patient.
Ae your house. Your father
chases me with a stick.
It's of no use really.
Father won't let me
come to the show.
If he does, he'll insist on
bringing the whole clan.
Their blood isn't enough.
We'll need another transfusion.
Will we find
a RH negative type?
Well, I'd better leave
...here's the invitation.
Your blood group's
RH negative?
I belong to all groups. If your
father agreed, we'd form another.
Will you give blood to a
woman, for my sake?
Give blood? For you, I'll give
my life. Just say the word.
Nurse, take him to get ready
to give blood.
Sure. Come on.
- Let's go.
Their names?
I was in jail for 2 years.
Where's Anthony? He's taken over.
There's one bottle left.
Break it, then pay for the damage.
You've made this place
Anthony Ville.
The police put you inside.
So I called this place
after myself, and so?
Come on, pay up!
Your going to take money from me?
- Of course!
Dump him, along with
the rest of the rubbish.
Well done, brother Anthony!
You've cleaned up this area,
you've made it decent.
May Allah give you strength
and may he weaken the crooks.
I haven't seen you around.
It can't be helped.
I'm busy preparing my concerts.
I've come to invite you to
today's program. You'll come?
Of course I'll come.
I couldn't miss it.
Any unsold tickets?
I'll sell them.
With Allah's blessings,
we're sold out.
Be sure to come. Don't sell the
ticket on the black market.
Are you Akbar?
Yes, what are you
doing here?
My son, you saved my life
that day you gave blood.
I cannot give you much
except my good wishes.
I've brought flowers.
They're lovely.
Tie them around my wrist.
If your blessings are with me,
today, I will be a success.
Son, may God grant
you success.
Now I must go inside.
- Where can I get a ticket?
- It's a full house.
Where can I get a ticket?
There are no extra tickets.
Can I get a ticket?
What are you doing
in this crowd?
- Who are you?
- Anthony Gonsalves.
What are you doing here?
I came to give Akbar flowers.
I'd like to go in.
- Come with me.
- But there are no tickets.
Never mind.
I have a special pass.
You sit in my seat, I'll sit
at your feet. Come, mother.
A girl hitches lifts, then she
and her friends rob the driver.
A girl?
He is a photographer...
...they robbed him today.
He managed to take a
photograph of the girl.
Someone stole my purse.
I don't even have bus fare.
Can you take me to
the cross roads?
Get in.
- Where do you live?
- I have several homes.
I am even prepared to come
to your home.
A good idea, but I have
no home, either.
You look clever, may be
you can find somewhere to stop.
The police?
You get scared easily.
- Yes.
I'll take you where even
the police fear to tread.
All right. Ae least, I'll see
where the police fear to tread.
- This is the place.
- There is nothing here.
What are you doing?
Pay up, or I'll scream
you were trying to rape me.
- Shall I scream for help?
- Go ahead.
Help! Help!
What happened?
This man tried to rape me!
You look a decent sort.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Trying to rape decent girls.
Let's call the police.
Is it necessary? Can't
we settle this between us?
All right. Give us all you've
got and we'll say no more.
Arrest them all.
You didn't run.
You'd rather be arrested?
Arrest me. Ae least I'll escape
from this terrible life.
You're forced to do this?
What else can I do?
I'm an orphan.
My stepmother and brother beat me,
and starve my grandmother.
Arrest me, Inspector, so that
I can be free.
Very well, then.
Come with me.
The police have
arrested Ranjeet.
You go free and let my
son be arrested!
I've begged you not
to force me to help them.
You're named after the Goddess
of wealth. You must make me rich.
Go and get him freed somehow.
How can I get him freed?
I haven't money for bail.
I don't care how.
Get the money!
Money?
You! Old hag!
You've one foot in the grave,
yet you sport fancy jewelry.
Take off those earrings!
No, I've kept them for Laxmi,
for her wedding.
If girls like Laxmi wed,
all brothels will close down.
Do as I say, or I'll pull
those earrings off you.
- Let go of her!
- Who are you?
I've heard everything.
Let go of them.
Who are you?
You got him?
What better bracelets than
these could you find?
It's a mistake.
Tell him we're decent people.
Ask her how much I love her.
I've understood all.
What's this? You've had me caught?
I'll get my revenge!
God bless you, my son.
I don't care about myself,
but I'm worried about her.
When Ranjeet returns,
he'll kill my grand-daughter.
That won't happen. He escaped,
but we'll soon catch him.
Till then, the C.I.D. Will guard
the house. You can live in peace.
This house is theirs,
not ours.
They don't even pay the rent.
The landlord's after them.
Then come with me.
Where?
To my house.
You swine! You've
dropped priceless stuff.
You?
Where's my daughter?
Insolent fellow! You've
ruined my shoe. Polish it!
Like a mirror!
- It must reflect my face!
- Where's my daughter?
- What daughter?
- You stole her away one night.
- I don't remember a thing.
- Please try.
When I was asleep...
Remember?
Yes, now I've got it.
Why is the whisky so bland?
No ice!
Remember this anna?
It's the coin you flung at me,
years ago, to mock my poverty.
Forgive me.
Have mercy on me.
No, never!
Mister Robert! I've bought all
your men. I've replaced you...
...and you're at my mercy.
Tell me where
my daughter is.
You impoverished
my family for years.
You separated them
from me forever.
Inspite of that, I cared for
your daughter like my own.
I sent her to study abroad.
- She's returning this week.
- Let me meet her just once.
No! I won't let you.
You'll suffer as I've suffered,
deprived of my children.
Don't be so cruel.
Handle this stuff with care.
I know you'd try
to double-cross me.
But you can't.
Seize him!
Don't move or I'll shoot!
Twice in a life, a man
is in such a hurry.
An Olympic race,
or a police chase.
Biscuits?
From which factory?
Looks like imported stuff.
Hide me,
the police are after me.
Why should I?
I could get a big reward,
and have my photo in the paper.
I'll give you half this gold.
- Have you hurt a policeman?
- No. I swear it.
What about the loot?
We split it three ways:
You, me, and my partner.
Him up there;
we work together.
But three ways...
I'll call the police.
O.K. I agree.
I don't want any treachery,
or I'll get fierce.
I swear by Jesus!
How is my Superintendent?
As a child I was separated
from my parents.
He's like a father to me.
I won't be orphaned again.
If anything happens to
my Superintendent...
...l'll not leave
any of you alive.
Tell me who shot him.
- Do you remember?
- Yes. His name's Robert.
What's the name of the man
you worked for?
Inspector Desai would
like a word, sir.
Amar, this man
has seen Robert.
- Where?
- With Anthony in Anthonyville.
Make inquires there.
Yes you.
Come here.
My bar has a license; you
can see the number written.
A cold drink for the gentleman.
Who's Anthony?
He must be next door, sir.
Wait here, I'll go and see.
I've seen you somewhere.
I'm not surprised. In big papers
you'll find small photos of me.
When I gave blood to an old
woman, you gave some, too.
Aren't you Anthony?
But my name is not just that.
It's Anthony Gonsalves.
Where's Robert?
What Robert?
The fast bowler
Andy Robert?
He went back to the West Indies.
Now I must be on my way, too.
Look, I've lived around
here for 22 years.
I greet everyone important;
I even greeted you.
No one treats me like this,
this is the first and last time.
Where's Robert?
If it wasn't for the respect
I have for your uniform...
...you'd be in hospital
by now.
So you want to show off
to your people?
You're the big boss here,
isn't that it?
You won't fight because
you respect the uniform?
So you're through.
Brother, we had a shake
hands in the end, eh?
You know karate? May be
you know kung fu, too.
You should've told me; I must
be mad, fighting with you.
Those tricks are stale.
So, brother?
The trick worked, eh?
I don't hurt the police.
They're like family.
Let him go.
What happened?
You're the big boss. Get up!
What'll everyone think of you?
Partner, you're in this beating
fifty-fifty, too. I'm going on.
You got me, but by cheating.
It hurts a lot, Inspector.
I've never had
such a beating.
I've taken on ten at a time,
and they've never touched me.
I only gave you a couple of
blows, but they were solid.
Talking won't save you.
Amar, I've brought your
favorite flowers today.
They're beautiful. Why do
you take this trouble everyday?
Trouble, son?
Mother?
That sounds like Anthony.
Who else could have such a
solid voice? He really beat me.
- What's he doing here?
- He's in a lock-up.
But he's a good boy.
He gave me blood as you did.
He, too, is like a son to me.
What's that you say, mother?
If we're both your sons,
then we ought to be brothers.
Eh, brother?
Say yes.
Amar son, let him go.
He isn't the sort
to let me go.
Not even if I were
his real brother.
He's very stern.
He's not like that at all.
Constable, it's time
to take him to court.
It's my first time in court.
Give me a flower for luck.
I will give the judge the
flower and make him my father.
May God bless you.
Where's Anthony?
Open the blindfold.
Where am I?
Am I at home?
Yes. Ae your dear father's.
If you were, no one would dare
kidnap me and bring me here.
Isn't that so?
I told ma, if the judge was
stern, I'd make him my father.
- Do you want to eat?
- Why not?
If my father asks,
how can I refuse?
Where's Robert?
He's asking you.
I'm asking you.
Who? Me?
Why are you hitting me?
I want my mother's blessings.
Let him go.
You believe in God?
I believe in all faiths. I pray
at temples, mosques and churches.
Sometimes, I end up at
the police station, too.
O.K. I'll sit quiet.
For the last time...
where's Robert?
If you don't tell me now,
my men will make you talk.
That won't be necessary.
I've eaten your salt.
I won't lie.
I can't remember where
I last saw Robert.
I need some fresh air.
You'll get fresh air
right here.
Keep him still.
Feed him until he
tells us where Robert is.
I'm eating, I'm eating.
I've lost my appetite.
Some air, please!
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.
So many of you and he
still escaped!
I don't want to hear anything!
Search every corner
of the city. Find him!
You?
Lock up! Most prisoners
aren't as decent as me.
Brother, it seems I got myself
into this mess needlessly.
You asked for Robert. So did
the gangster who snatched me.
What gangster?
How do I know?
I gave him the slip.
When you had the chance to
escape, why did you come back?
If I didn't come back, your job
would be at risk, wouldn't it?
Mother said you and me
are like brothers.
So we're brothers.
How can one brother
cheat the other?
Anthony, you go on about us
two being like brothers.
Yet you refuse to tell me where
Robert is. He shot my chief.
Robert shot your chief?
Then he lied to me.
I'll show you where Robert is.
John, where's Robert?
He hit me and ran away.
Why didn't you stop him?
He ought to be in jail.
I've made a big mistake.
He didn't say he shot
at the police or I'd...
Put me back in jail,
if you like.
If we don't get him within
a month, you'll be inside.
So you'd better start
looking for him right away.
Didn't I warn you that if you
didn't behave better...
...the police would
surely come here?
I warned you. You got
into trouble, didn't you?
Will you obey me now?
Then get married.
Anything you say, but I'm not
going to marry.
Why not?
I must find someone on the
right plane.
Plane? What do you mean?
One who'd set the violin of
the heart to play automatically.
Bells of the mind to chime.
It should feel as though
an angle from heaven...
...has landed in a plane at the
airport of my heart.
Howll you know your daughter?
It's simple. You see that man
with the black hat?
The girl he greets
will be my daughter.
Welcome home. Don't you
recognize me...
...your late father's friend?
Come daughter.
- What is all this?
Don't worry. I'm your father.
He's my enemy, trying to kidnap you.
I'll explain everything
in the car.
- Uncle, what was all that?
- A little drama, to protect you.
The man who just left
is your father's murderer.
He had come to kidnap you;
I'll tell you all about it.
Twenty two years ago,
on 15th august...
...I was trying to escape from
that man.
I hid my three sons in Borivali
Park and ran away.
Those people pursued me.
I shook them off. When I got
back to the park, it was empty.
My children had been
separated from me.
God willing, you will surely
find your children...
...and that man will be
punished.
Don't move!
My life is in danger;
stay where you are.
Well done, Ranjeet! I did well
to take you into my gang.
It was nothing, Robert;
just a sample of what I can do.
You know what to do with her,
don't you? Take her away!
Jenny, this is Zebesko.
He's your bodyguard; he'll
accompany you wherever you go.
That's not mine.
Not your's? Then whose is it?
Now what?
That isn't mine, either.
No, this is mine.
Keep it, it will
suit you very well.
It's Easter. You and I...
Will you come
to a dance with me?
I'm going to the Catholic
Gymkhana with someone else.
Stay here. Don't go away.
Please come. The bells of
my mind have begun to chime.
Come along. Jenny
So you got a hammering?
That's why I've told you
not to drink.
Drinking is a terrible thing.
If you weren't drunk, you think
that fatso could've hit you?
You can beat up 10 men
at a time.
But you never listen to me.
Do you ever?
Look at your face.
How much he beat you!
You look a complete idiot!
Stand still.
I'll put some ointment.
Don't move!
Why are you moving?
Look man... it'll burn
a little.
Don't scream.
I'll get very angry.
It burns a little,
doesn't it?
That's why I tell you
not to drink.
Drinking is terrible.
I'll put on a bandage.
You'll be fine by the morning.
All right. I'm off to bed.
You'd better get some sleep.
Father, I have a
confession to make.
Anthony was beaten up
because of me.
I like him very much...
What are you doing here?
I was dusting the box. I saw you,
so I thought, I'd try my luck.
- It's a sin to listen in.
- I'll ask pardon.
- No, not in here.
- Then where?
Outside.
But Zebesko's there.
Why does he hover over you?
What can I do?
He's my bodyguard.
From now,
I'll be your bodyguard.
Look at what I got. A camera to
take your picture with.
Not today; father is at home.
Come back tomorrow.
To hell with your father!
We'll meet tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Tomorrow
never comes!
Bijli, why have you
come here?
You haven't been
to see me for ages.
So I thought I'd come
and see you.
So he's a Casanova!
Go away! If anyone sees you,
my reputation'll be at stake.
I'll photograph the father.
Just pay up
six months expenses...
...or in a flash I'll have
you branded a sinner.
It must have been lightning.
Not yet...
...when lightning flashes,
your timberyard will be destroyed.
Just go away and I'll
sent the money to you.
It'll be in your own interest.
So, Taiyyab Ali, you had
Akbar beaten up by thugs?
- Did you or didn't you?
- I did.
Stop him. Inform the police!
Just stay put!
Phone the police!
I've brought your father-in-law
and a priest...
...to get you and Salma
married.
Get on with it, priest.
Listen to me, Lofty.
- How high are you, Shorty?
- Four feet, four inches.
I'll reduce you to two
feet, two inches.
No, Anthony brother, I won't
get married like this.
Don't you play up.
I had to drag this priest away
from another marriage.
I could have become violent
if I'd wanted to.
But I wish to win people over
with love, not with force.
Don't talk of philosophy
and decency. I've heard enough.
And now you refuse
to marry?
Until he willingly gives me
his daughter's hand...
...I won't marry.
He'll be willing
after I sort him out.
I'm giving you a last chance.
You'll amount to nothing.
He'll marry her to someone else.
Then don't whine about being
crossed in love. I'll wallop you.
Go to hell!
Coming, shorty?
I don't find this insolence
very funny. Let me go.
Where are you going?
Who are you to ask me?
To meet that layabout Anthony?
Watch your tongue!
You're only my bodyguard.
I agree. I'm your bodyguard.
I'll guard your body
all life long.
So no one else touches it.
What nonsense!
I'm talking nothing but sense.
You will marry me.
If your arm had been steel,
I'd have bent it.
I need to talk to Robert.
Telephone for you.
Your daughter is with me.
Who are you?
What can you pay for your daughter?
I can pay anything.
If you say I can marry your daughter
then you can have her back.
I agree.
Then come to 325 Silverbeas.
Where's Jenny?
To meet her boyfriend.
Yes. The one that she meets
secretly.
Gracie is with her.
Are you her bodyguard or
is Gracie?
Don't let this happen again.
Looks like they are here.
The guy behind seems to
be in a hurry.
They only drive this fast
on 2 occasions.
It's an Olympic race.
Or a police chase.
Day and night, all you
think of is Jenny.
When I can, I'll stop the car,
Get out at once.
- What about you?
- Don't worry, I'll handle them.
Run over him!
You see to him
I'll look after Jenny.
Come along, father.
Sorry, there are no
empty beds.
Bed 102 must be empty.
Akbar is in bed 102.
That's me!
I left two hours ago.
He's badly hurt,
admit him at once.
What name?
Kishenlal.
Kishenlal's escaped again!
When'll I get my daughter back?
Don't worry, Robert,
You'll get Jenny soon.
You promised to let me
marry her.
I don't remember any such
promise.
Do you forget your promises
so quickly? Never mind.
I'll show you a man who'll
help you remember your promises.
Who is he?
So your men brought me here.
No I knew nothing about it,
brother.
We had the same parents, but
I'm not a smuggler and murderer.
He was abroad for 10 years,
with an International Bank.
I'll tell you why he's here.
For a World Bank Conference.
I met him by chance; since
then he's been my guest.
Robert, the police are
after you.
If they catch you,
you'll surely hang.
There's only one way out.
If you allow Jenny to marry me.
You can impersonate Albert
and fly to London.
What about Albet?
Albert? I'll take
care of him.
Kishenlal must be in hospital;
he'll tell us where Jenny is.
Akbar, son.
Where did the patient go?
He's gone for an operation.
But I have brought him
flowers.
Where is the operating
theatre?
Kishenlal, come round now.
Where is my daughter?
Answer, or else
I'll kill you.
He won't regain
consciousness like that.
You're a doctor,
bring him round.
So your strength lies in this!
This protects you!
I want to give the patient
flowers; open the door, doctor.
Open the door, doctor.
See who it is.
The patient's condition
is critical.
Kishenlal's wife!
Now I'll get my daughter.
Bring her along.
Just you sit quiet.
I can see again!
Son, are you Akbar?
Through your devotion and Sai
Baba's miracle, I can see again.
But why are you so
disheveled?
Some thugs are chasing me,
I've just escaped from them.
Don't worry,
come with me.
This is my father.
This lady sells flowers,
I've told you about her.
She can see again!
If I am not mistaken...
...you are the person I found
wounded, twenty-two years ago.
I led you to your home;
don't you remember?
Was that you?
I remember that black night
well; how could I forget it?
That night I was separated
from my husband and my children.
You had found a lost child;
it must be quite grown up now.
Yes, that child is
quite grown up.
Father calls him Abu.
You call him son.
Others know him as Akbar.
My Raju!
It's a photo of mine.
But that is a photograph of
Raju, my youngest son!
God, you are indeed great!
This is know as
God's glory.
When he took away your sight,
He also took away your children.
Now He restores your sight,
and your children.
This is my Raju?
Come, we've done our work
It's certain death to go in,
Father and daughter's trapped.
Father is trapped there.
I want to thank you, yet I'm
ashamed to thank you here.
No need to thank me;
I only did my duty.
I'm ashamed because I didn't
do my duty earlier.
But I shall do it today.
May God bless you both.
So much has happened today.
Father gives us his blessing...
...the husband of the lady
who sells flowers...
...was admitted.
The man you brought
in was her husband.
This tiny box contains all
the world's happiness for you.
What is in it?
See for yourself.
Sindoor?
But I shouldn't wear it.
You must put sindoor
on your head again today.
What are you saying?
It's the truth.
Your husband is still alive!
My father is still alive!
When you came to the hospital,
father was being operated on.
Really?
- Yes. Now put this on.
Son, take me there.
Kishenlal? He's left.
This morning his doctor came
and had him discharged.
- Where has he gone?
- I don't know.
There must be some mistake.
I said that he's gone.
Where could they have gone?
Don't worry, mother. Go home.
I'll report this to the police.
What name?
Where did he live?
Bandra Koliwada.
The name sounds familiar.
All right, I'll make
inquiries.
Sorry, sir, I made a mistake.
You made a mistake?
Kishenlal can forgive
a killing...
...but he's not Robert, he
won't forgive starving a family.
Take him away.
Sister, I have wronged you,
forgive me.
I'll give you your allowance
personally every month.
Nothing has changed.
But circumstances
have changed me.
Once Kishenlal and his
family lived happily here.
Kishenlal? He lived in
that house, over there.
God, take all I have.
Just return my
children to me.
How did you know that pistol
was buried there?
Twenty-two years ago,
on 15th August...
...my father gave it to me.
I buried it here to hide it
from my younger brother.
But why do you ask?
You remember the pistol
your father gave you...
...but you do not remember
your father?
Son, I am your father...
...Kishenlal.
The capital which God snatched
from me twenty-two years ago...
...was returned with interest,
my son has come to be...
...a police officer
Son, I left two younger
brothers with you.
I was reunited with the
youngest only this morning.
And the other?
I want a perfect fitting.
The skirt should be graceful.
Don't worry,
my father is an expert.
Who are you to talk?
You've never got married.
The frill should be from neck
to waist; absolutely beautiful
Akbar, ask your
friend to go out.
What happened?
He started the fight, so I took
a step back and swung my fist.
All right, we're going.
Be sure it's first-class.
- Hurry!
- I'll arrange for the band.
Before you go, I'd like
to make an announcement.
Tomorrow is a joyous
day for me.
I invite you all
to a happy occasion.
22 years ago, on 15th August,
Independence Day...
...when all were
celebrating...
...I found on the steps of
the Borivali church...
...a three year old child,
with a letter in his hand.
Someone had abandoned him.
That child grew up here,
under the Lord's protection.
You all know him by
the name of Anthony.
Tomorrow he will marry the
beautiful Miss Jenny...
...who is sitting with you.
Uncle, this is Jenny.
Are you well?
Yes, but where are you
phoning from?
St. Thomas's Church.
Congratulations, Uncle
Congratulations? What for?
You told me you had lost your
sons on Independence Day.
One has been found.
And it is him
that I am marrying.
What did you say?
Yes, Uncle, and his
name is...
Who're you?
I'm your father;
I've come to fetch you.
I'll scream for help.
What are you doing?
You take her. I'll be
right there.
Where are you taking Jenny?
No violence in God's house.
Don't interfere.
I'm not afraid of a knife.
Here they are.
Let me go!
Where do you think
you're going?
Just have a look
at my style.
All say; "You're handsome. Mind
no one casts an evil eye on you"
From today, I'll give up making
liquor and being a hoodlum
I'll be an honest man,
like you.
For the first time...
...I say it from my heart.
Who did this to you,
Father.
Do not make me an orphan for
the second time, Father.
Someone did this to Father
in your own house.
And You watched silently?
You should have called me
from this world.
There is no need for me.
But there is need for him.
Thousand of children like
Anthony are abandoned to die...
...on church steps
They leave a letter like this
with the children, then go away.
Who looks after the
children? He does.
Now if a child is abandoned,
who will look after it?
Today I ask
something of you.
Tell me where the man is
who did this to Father.
If You don't tell me,
I swear by you...
...l'll become so bad, no
power on earth will change me.
Look, I have sworn
by you.
Who's that man? Tell me.
This locket belongs to...
Recognize this?
It's mine.
Howd you get it?
It was lying near Father.
But Robert took it from me.
When he was trying to take
his daughter Jenny.
Jenny is Robert's daughter?
Yes, the daughter of
my greatest enemy.
What a quirk of fate.
Her father's out for
my blood...
...and the boy she is marrying
is my long-last son.
Jenny is marrying
your son?
I didn't know either, until
she told me on the phone.
Father and daughter
are so unlike
The father separated
my children from me.
Jenny will reunite
me with my son.
If the boy is your son...
Recognize this letter?
This is my wife's letter!
Where did you get it?
I cannot remember.
22 years ago I was left...
...outside a church, with
this letter in my hand
That means...
That means you're my father.
How fortunate I am today;
I've found all three sons.
Yes, Amar and Akbar as well.
I've come for Jenny's gown.
Who might you be?
Never mind who I am, go and
fetch Jenny's wedding gown.
This is fishy,
Akbar, do something.
What about alterations?
You'd better take my uncle.
Must he come?
It's vital. Wait here,
I'll rustle up uncle.
Be considerate! I'm old enough
to be your grandfather.
What a catch!
Catch?
Do I look like a fish?
You look decent but you're
insolent. I'm the master-tailor.
I've cut to size many
a fellow like you.
I'm the youngest. My older
brothers wield sharper scissors.
Get on with your work.
Then I'll go, I had to stop
work when he brought me here.
This is how you "catch" me.
See how rude you were?
Take him to Jenny, fast.
Let me measure you!
These people have brought
me here by force.
So you caught her, too! You
go around catching everybody.
Now I see what
you mean by 'catch'
I have had a 'catch'
Here's the master-tailor,
to complete the fitting.
I refuse to wear it!
Get out of here!
You won't wear it?
Are you going to get married,
or take up fisticuffs?
Never strike a woman.
Child, do as he says.
Get out, I said!
Figure it out.
Keep your distance; say what
you have to say out loud.
I say; you can hunt
high and low...
...but you'll find no one
as handsome as him.
He can marry
your daughter, then.
Please understand!
I'm Akbar.
Allah ho Akbar! She'll give
the game away in a minute.
- Now I must get going.
- What about measurements?
My eyes have taken in
every detail.
Master-tailor,
where are you going?
This order belongs to my older
brother, I'm going to fetch him.
You can't go until
after the wedding.
Do you expect me to give a
dance recital at my age?
I'm respectful and you
tell me to shut up.
It's Pedro.
No cutting, no fitting.
No fitting, no wedding.
Do the fitting here. We'll bring
all you want from the bazaar.
Bazaar stuff is only fit
for bazaar tailors.
Our machines date back
to the British...
...our needless to
the emperors.
Make a list;
we'll send it to your shop
Sir, I have a request.
Can you give me a chance to talk?
I talk politely and
you tell me to shut up.
Robert? Where have
you been?
I need a priest and a band.
You are marrying?
I'm not marrying; it's for
my daughter's wedding.
Meet me with those people
at Naaz Hotel at five.
I can't come there,
but my men will.
Making me write, at my age?
I'll write in Urdu; no one
will understand.
Jenny is in danger. Inform
Amar and Anthony at once.
Stay here,
I'll get the stuff ready.
Read this.
Inform Amar and
Anthony at once.
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry about me.
Where're we taking the stuff?
You're going nowhere;
I'll take it.
Oh, no!
I'll hand it over personally.
But who are you?
The master-tailor's wife.
Why are you here?
He can't do the job
without me.
He can only stitch if
I thread the needle.
He can only cut if my hand
holds his on the scissors.
Aren't I right?
All right, get the
gown ready.
- Do Amar and Anthony know?
- Yes, they're being told.
Are you Pedro's men?
Jenny, meet my dear sister,
Laxmi.
This is Jenny's gown, Dress
her. Wear this dress yourself.
She will be your
bridesmaid.
See that Jenny is ready
in ten minutes.
Or else...
you know your brother.
Please get dressed,
or he will kill me.
Why aren't the priest and
the band here yet?
Amarlal and Brothers
reporting.
But where are your
brothers?
Sir, we are three in one.
My brothers are here,
all around.
Be they Hindu, Muslim,
or Christian. All brothers.
Will you play alone?
Listen, man, by God's grace,
one is equal to twenty
To a merry tune, give a chance,
your feet will start to dance
- Eh, brother?
- God willing.
Where's that son
of a Father?
A Father is called a Father and
yours is standing before you.
Congratulations!
Father, I'm the bride's father.
The bridegroom is there.
I take back my kiss and give
it to him. He's so handsome.
God must have made you in
His spare time.
Just wait until I have
time to spare for you.
The bride is upstairs.
Tell her that Father Anthony
has come for the marriage.
How our eyes longed for the
sight of you. Where were you?
Brother Illahabadi,
how are you?
You know each other?
Between his youth and old age,
I performed 4 marriages for him.
- I've seen you somewhere.
- Danced to my tune, no doubt.
Do you take this woman
for your wife?
Do you take this man
for your husband?
Don't touch her,
you're only half married
- Fetch a doctor!
- I am a doctor
Your daughter is going
to be a mother.
Nonsense!
You were her bodyguard! That
was a fine way of guarding her!
But I didn't do anything!
Take her upstairs.
You rascal, I'll kill you!
Before you kill me, man, I'll
kill you and your daughter.
I wondered why he so readily
agreed to our marriage.
I'll ask the girl to confess
who is the father of the child.
Escape down this rope.
Phone the police. We'll keep
them occupied.
What are you doing here?
I've brought the priest
and a musician.
The men you sent
arrived long ago.
I didn't send anyone.
Then who's this?
Humbly yours,
Akbar Illahabaadi
Robert, you're the one
I was waiting for.
Long ago, you and I began this
story; today we'll finish it.
Bharati, why are
you crying?
You should be happy.
You had lost three sons...
...but today God
has restored them...
...and three daughter-in-law
as well.
Inspector, I wish to hold my
sons in my arms just once.
