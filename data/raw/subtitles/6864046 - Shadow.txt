May I speak with you, Sire.
Sire!
Sire.
Commander...
Him again.
What now?
He visited Jing City yesterday.
What?
He went to Jing.
For what?
To give Yang a birthday greeting.
He went yesterday
and you only tell me now?
Lu.
My most trusted minister.
This is how you serve me?
Has he returned?
Not yet.
Go, wait for him.
The minute he returns
bring him to me right away.
Yes, Sire.
"COMMANDER'S RESIDENCE"
What does it say?
This reading is about
masculine power.
No place for women here.
Qian, the male, origin of all things
shall rule the world.
This reading
is "Qian".
This is Heaven's will.
Brother.
There's been talk of this in the Palace.
The reading's also a positive sign.
When will the battle begin?
Summer, or autumn?
The reading says...
Our time will come in seven days.
Seven days?
After seven days of rain
we'll win when the waters rise.
The Commander enters!
Our brave lone hero has returned!
Sister.
Reporting.
Sire.
Sire...
I've heard
you went to celebrate Yang's birthday.
Yes!
I'm sure you gave a lovely speech.
I went to Jing to claim one thing.
The city YAN Kingdom has
occupied for 20 years.
Is he willing to return it?
No.
So you declared war?
Yang and I have agreed
in a few days, under the City Pass
to duel one-on-one
and see who wins.
Our two nations are allies.
A duel between our chief commanders
means war.
Don't you understand this?
He agreed to it.
Alright then.
Tell me.
Are you sure you can beat him?
Yes or no?
What are your odds?
3 out of 10 at best.
Absurd.
Were it not for our Peace Treaty.
Pei would have been lost long ago.
Great work.
You've ruined everything.
Jing City still belongs to Pei.
It's under YAN Kingdom's occupation.
Every righteous man of Pei
longs to win it back.
No ruler can oppose his people's will.
If Jing isn't reclaimed.
Pei will perish under your reign.
Commander.
How dare you say that?
I'd rather never take Jing back
than destroy the Alliance.
On your behalf I've
told them otherwise.
And would you also be King on my behalf?
What's done is done.
And my punishment?
Alright.
Let's not argue.
Father died too early.
My sister and I had only each other.
It was thanks to you, Commander
that I finally gained the throne.
Let's drop the subject.
Sire is right.
Let's just enjoy this rare gathering
I've long heard that
you and your wife play
the most exquisite duets
I've always wanted to hear you.
So...
Will you play for me?
Sire...
Our Kingdom is in distress
I'm... not in the mood.
Commander.
Don't disappoint the King.
Yes, please.
We'll all enjoy your music.
Come.
Bring the zithers.
Come.
Come.
Come.
Please.
What?
I, your King.
Can't get you to play for me?
Commander.
Sire I am guilty.
You haven't started yet.
What could you be guilty of?
I will not distract my husband
with beautiful sights and sounds
I've sworn to Heaven
that until the day Jing's reclaimed
I'll not play a note of music.
Otherwise.
Otherwise what?
I'll cut off my finger
to prove my resolve.
An impressive vow to Heaven.
But I am the Heaven of Pei
I've asked you to play.
Will you not obey me?
Fine then.
Don't play today.
Take them away.
Come.
No.
They will play.
Then I won't listen.
Commander.
Madam is ready for you.
Madam's vow
is mine as well
I'll cut my hair
to beg Heaven's forgiveness.
Commander, don't.
Commander, don't.
Don't do this.
Alright, don't play then.
No need to make a scene.
We'll take our leave.
Sire, why did you insist
that Commander play?
I was just trying to
deflate his arrogance
I'll have to clean up his mess.
There's only one option left.
Yang's son, Ping
has not yet married, right?
Sire means to say...
Marry off my wild sister.
Shouldn't we ask if she's willing?
I'm her elder brother.
No need to ask.
You must make Yang understand:
Commander doesn't represent me.
We don't intend to take back Jing.
Much less start a war.
My proposal
will show my sincerity.
All right I'll choose a good day
to go make the proposal.
You may leave.
Yes, Sire.
To play as one.
Two hearts must beat as one.
As is the case with you and Madam
I haven't even dared to practice.
I deserve to die.
Had you been exposed.
You would indeed deserve to die.
We'd both deserve to die.
You must master the zither
and suffer this cut.
Commander.
Please proceed.
These herbs are harsh.
In an hour.
The wound will rot and
look just like mine.
Whatever you're holding in...
let it out, you'll feel better.
Let it out!
When I was 8 I strayed from my mother
and drifted, lost, through Jing City.
I passed out from hunger.
Your uncle happened to pass by
I'll never forget that bowl of rice...
I've been here over 20 years...
Your days here
have indeed been hard.
I owe you both my deepest gratitude.
Uncle was a cruel man.
Every time you tried to escape
he beat you so hard you passed out.
This place
is your prison, your cage.
Press on it for me.
And after he died.
I put you through such brutal training.
You must hate me for it.
How could I hate you?
I'd be willing to die in pieces
to repay your gracious kindness.
It's Yang who should die in pieces.
If you kill him I'll
let you go home.
My Husband.
Uncle was so right to choose you.
Besides looking just like me
you're incredibly quick-witted.
Since making your debut a year ago
you've been so good you've fooled them all.
Sometimes I even wonder
if my wife can still tell us apart?
I've found your mother.
My mother.
She's still alive?
She's still right there in Jing.
Wandering homeless in the streets
I've bought your old house.
Had everything set up.
She's settled in there now.
How did you find her?
Does she know I'm still alive?
So you have a huge stake
in this battle.
After Jing's taken
you two can reunite.
Your zither needs tuning.
Yours is in the major key.
The strings need tightening.
Thank you.
You can go.
You've got just four hours
to put this ointment on the wound.
You can't be a moment late.
Your husband is the most noble,
most strategic,
most admired man in Pei.
And I?
But I'm nothing but a servant.
Nothing more than his shadow.
You're not a shadow.
You are you.
Who am I then?
You were born in Jing.
You yearn to go home.
Maybe your mother
is waiting at the lane's end.
Watching every passerby.
Waiting for your return.
Many years ago
my mother went blind.
She couldn't even see me.
If she were waiting there
she could only listen,
straining to hear the sound of my steps.
No earlier, no later
you've suddenly found her,
just in time to ensure I'll obediently
fight this battle for you.
You've kept me caged in secret.
Do you great, noble people
know what scares me most?
Darkness.
No one else.
No light.
No sound.
Only me in total darkness
I'd touch everywhere.
Touch everything.
Rub every tiny crack in the wall.
To keep myself from going mad.
To prove to myself I was still alive.
And so you always sleep on the floor
with the lamp lit all night.
It's time for you to go to Court.
"THE GREAT HALL OF PEI"
Who wishes to speak?
I, Sire.
Proceed
I've disobeyed your commands.
Went to Jing and declared war.
Damaged the Alliance.
Please, Sire, punish me.
And the punishment?
Beheading.
Brother.
You can't behead him.
Our Kingdom's great hero.
Our Great General.
You can't be beheaded.
How could we do without you?
My dear Lu.
What do you think?
He declared war on his own.
Put Pei at great risk.
A grave error indeed.
Lu.
All right.
Brother.
I hereby revoke Commander's powers.
Confiscate his sword and seals.
Henceforth he is a commoner.
No.
Sire...
Do it.
I have no other choice.
You see this "Ode to Peace"?
I wrote it and hung it here
as a reminder to us all.
The Alliance is our lifeblood.
Anyone who violates it,
lord or subject, will pay the price.
We will always keep the peace.
Never speak of a war you can't win.
From this day on,
anyone who speaks of this again
will be instantly beheaded.
Thank you for sparing my life.
I'm leaving.
Wait.
Brother.
What more do you want?
Nothing.
I'm just holding court.
The Commander.
Has fought countless battles
and suffered many wounds.
But the one that
concerns me most
is the wound from Yang's saber.
A wound few could recover from.
Indeed, yes.
It still hasn't healed
I've found a rare ointment
that can heal your wound.
After you leave today,
who knows when we'll meet again?
I want to see you've used this
so I'll know you'll be alright.
Why trouble yourself with this?
I'll go back and have my wife...
As I said.
I want to apply it myself.
Commander's wound
is Pei's as well.
Should any of you prove as loyal.
I would serve you the same way.
Commander.
This wound
looks fresh.
You're trying to trick me.
I beg Sire's punishment.
My old wound has healed.
This cut
was self-inflicted.
My loss to Yang is my greatest shame.
This cut is a reminder that
as long as Yang lives,
my wound will never heal.
Until we reclaim Jing
how can we speak of peace?
How dare you
brazenly resist my orders?
I'm a commoner now
I'll have my duel with Yang.
Why should that concern you?
At Court today
the King suddenly challenged him.
He handled it well despite the scare.
Quite impressive.
He's good.
But no one could tell that wound is new.
The King was testing him.
My "Ode to Peace"
is quite well-written.
Why did you demote Commander?
So tell me.
Why'd he have to go cut himself?
Why bother?
To remember the shame of defeat.
It was an honorable act.
He's not like you.
You wouldn't dare retake Jing.
All you do is compromise.
You've become a pitiful joke.
I do this all for Pei.
You think I don't know you?
You do things only for your throne.
Fine, for my throne...
Which has never been safe for a day.
Legend says Yang's Great Saber
was forged by a master blacksmith
on a night of a full moon.
It's destined to take hundreds of lives
as offerings to the Saber God.
It weighs 40 kilos.
Glows in the night.
Glints cold in the day.
And kills in three rounds.
Round One.
You're not focused.
Your mind is elsewhere.
Round Two...
My dear Husband.
You need to stop.
Again.
I fear your strength won't hold.
Why worry?
It's either you or me.
Come on.
Round Three.
That was exactly the blow.
I took from Yang that day.
Though I used only half its force,
you're already done for.
My dear Husband
I'll help you up.
Your mind's elsewhere.
A distracted mind
means shaky breathing.
Shaky breathing
means no firm steps.
How will you survive
without firm steps?
Have you forgotten who you are?
Tell me.
Who are you?
Jing.
What?
Jing.
You named me after Jing City
so I'd never forget our great cause.
I only need you because I'm dying.
Focus on your task.
Forget everything else.
Strokes with rhythm.
Words that dance.
My unique style.
How exquisite.
Wonderful.
Superb calligraphy.
Truly great.
Sister.
Look at the "Pei" I wrote.
What do you think?
Lu is here.
Leave.
Humbly reporting.
How was your trip to Jing?
Sire...
The Yangs have been told
of your marriage proposal.
They are quite pleased.
Good.
Good.
Brother.
Who's getting married?
You...
Without even telling me?
What do you think I am?
A single marriage
to make peace between two nations.
You're the Princess.
You should understand
this I won't do it.
Go yourself.
Continue.
However.
To thank them for protecting the City,
the King of YAN has offered his daughter
to Yang's son, Ping.
They can't refuse.
So... what do we do?
Well, Ping has an idea.
Which is...?
Sire, may I brief you privately?
What are you afraid of?
Speak.
Sire.
It's...
Everyone here
has risked his life for me.
In front of these men
there can be no secrets.
Ping proposes
to take Princess as a concubine,
thus fulfilling everyone's wishes.
Well that's...
also a way...
Ping has offered
his personal dagger
as an engagement gift.
Provided Sire does not object,
the marriage is confirmed.
Kill...
Kill those damn Yangs.
Sire.
Give me 30,000 soldiers
I'll bathe Jing in blood.
Sire...
Seize Jing City.
Hack the Yangs to pieces.
Win Jing back.
Don't you dare.
Have you forgotten my order?
Those who talk of taking Jing
shall be beheaded.
Sire.
This is spineless.
Humiliating.
Our Kingdom will perish
under your reign.
Tian,
how dare you defy the King.
Drag him out.
Strip him of his rank.
Guards!
I'll do it.
How dare he be so insolent.
Sire.
Does he still see you as his King?
Clownish King.
Sire, Tian's words
amount to rebellion.
Don't trouble yourself, Sire.
You...
Sire.
Step aside Princess.
Step aside.
I'll accept the gift.
Tell him I agree.
"JING PRACTICE GROUNDS"
You forced me back two steps.
Good tactic, son.
We Yangs are known for
force, speed and death in three rounds.
But responding nimbly to
a master fighter's moves
is the true essence of our technique.
Have you ever fought a true master?
No, not yet.
When the Pei Commander visited
what was your impression?
Just as I'd envisioned him.
Distinguished and strong.
That crippling blow I'd given him...
I was shocked to see
he's recovered completely,
good as new,
poised and gracious as ever.
He'd come just to see you, Father.
He wouldn't dare give offense.
Ping.
You've proposed to take the Princess
as your concubine.
Isn't that "giving offense"?
I want them to give up trying
to use a marriage to
win Jing City back.
But I've just been told
they've accepted your engagement gift.
Don't you think that's odd?
So what?
Their King dismissed their Commander.
Wounded Tian.
Forfeited two great generals.
They must all be demoralized.
And anyway.
If there's any sign of trouble there
our spy will tell us right away,
so there's no need to worry.
You're right.
Father.
Now that the City's stable.
His Majesty has again asked us
to redeploy troops...
The situation's quite tense there.
Let's do this.
Keep 800 soldiers here
and send the remaining 30,000
to support his Majesty.
Will we have enough left here?
We have strong natural barriers...
And in any case.
I and my saber are unbeatable
800 will suffice.
Let me try
I've often watched you.
I think I understand it.
Pei umbrellas are
soft and flexible.
They work best in the rain.
They are water weapons.
Water is yin.
Yang's moves are hard and fierce.
Like fire.
Fire is yang.
Yin counters yang.
Water puts out fire.
And so.
Wield it with feminine moves.
What do you think?
Feminine moves?
I designed this taichi diagram.
Why haven't I thought of this?
Watch us from the side.
Madam.
Come.
Madam.
Practice with Jing.
Teach him quickly.
What are you waiting for?
If we don't find a way to beat Yang
we'll have wasted all our efforts.
This will be another
Yang-style saber round.
Hug tight together.
If our minds can meld as one
you'll grasp the technique.
Quickly.
Madam.
Pardon me.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
Get up.
Though Yang's attacks are fierce
he loses stamina fast.
Jing.
If you apply Madam's technique
you can kill him.
Yes.
There's someone you must go see.
You can leave now.
Yes.
Your hearts and minds
were truly at one just now.
We were merely copying your moves...
Why speak of hearts and minds?
Can he win?
Your technique
can give Jing confidence.
He has to believe
he can win
in order to last three rounds.
And after three rounds?
I'll just need an hour.
That lingering, echoing melody
felt trapped, with no way out.
That must be
how you're feeling, Sir.
You know what lies beyond the forest?
100 convicts in hiding.
They live for fighting and killing
yet look strangely gentle
I've promised
to let them go free if they reclaim Jing.
I brought them there to train,
yet couldn't find a winning technique.
But now we have a way.
Learn it, train them.
Become their leader.
Yes, Sir.
Take this flute.
When you play it
they'll know you've been sent by me
and they'll obey you
I'll do as you say, Commander.
Commander wants to see you.
Commander.
I'm neither man nor ghost.
Not the Commander you've known.
You will always be my Commander.
In the Mang River battle
you killed a dozen men
to save my life.
Suffered over twenty wounds.
Lay in a coma for three days.
My little cut is nothing.
Come.
Sit.
When I was eight.
On the first day of Spring.
Father was assassinated.
It happened in Court
in front of all the ministers.
The killer
cut his head off with an ax.
Uncle worried I'd meet the same fate.
He searched everywhere.
At last, in Jing City
he found a boy my age
who looked just like me.
He brought him here for secret training,
hoping to shield me from palace intrigue.
To protect me.
That boy's become the "shadow".
My wound worsened last year.
My health failed
I suddenly aged.
No one is to know this...
So you started using the Shadow.
But Madam, does she...
Madam knows.
She pities him.
She's urged me
to let him go home.
I called you here today
so she can show you
how to defeat Yang.
I see...
That day the King inspected his wound...
Did he already
suspect he's a "shadow"?
What do you think?
Commander.
Why stay locked in this narrow cell
trying to read the King's mind?
Why not replace him
and become our King?
There's not a general or soldier
who'd hesitate to support you.
What impudence!
Sorry.
The King serves his purpose.
You...
are very good.
You've always been good.
To win Jing back
I'll need three people.
One is the Shadow.
One the King.
And the third is you.
From this tiny cell
I'll launch my scheme
and watch you each play your part,
reclaiming our land on my behalf.
Won't it be thrilling?
And then?
I will be King.
You'll be Commander.
Sorry.
You're more like the
Commander than he is.
For a moment there.
I didn't know how to react
I've been your Commander
I'll still be your Commander.
That's all there is.
Yang's saber technique
is hard and strong.
Wield your umbrellas
with feminine moves.
Borrow the slickness of the rain.
Using yin to counter yang
is our only way to win.
Nonstop clouds and rain.
We'll win when the waters rise.
It's rained for four days.
If it rains for three more
the river water will rise
and submerge Jing's storm drain.
Commander rightly chose
this moment for the duel.
Whatever happens, win or lose.
The moment has arrived.
False, true.
True, false
just like in a game of chess.
But who, after all
are the pawns?
So turning me into a concubine
was also a move in your game?
Just an improvised ploy,
a decoy move.
And the real move, then?
Tell me then, what is real?
To tomorrow.
To a swift victory.
You left home so young.
Do you know your way back?
I think so.
You'll be able to find it?
They say a pup taken at birth
can find its birthplace
by tracing the scent
I've been yearning to return.
I know I can find it.
Actually.
I also long to go home.
But isn't Pei your home?
Home has many meanings.
Jing.
To a swift victory.
I know.
I can't win tomorrow.
Actually.
You've had many chances to refuse.
You could have run away.
Why didn't you?
You've always seemed so obedient.
So willing to do this.
Because of you.
When I was young I
was being forced.
But since I've grown older
and come to know you
I've only had one thing in mind.
I would do
anything for you.
In tomorrow's fight
I'll be just a decoy.
No one cares whether a decoy lives or dies
I care.
Tonight
is the last you'll spend here.
Yes.
Madam.
Thank you.
Reporting to General Yang.
The Pei Commander has arrived alone.
Says he's come as agreed.
"JING CITY PASS"
Father.
How'd the ship slip through so easily?
Some sort of cheap trick.
General Yang.
Our foolish King has dismissed me
I've no power.
No soldiers.
Honor our gentlemen's agreement.
Duel with this commoner
to see who prevails.
Father.
Something seems odd.
That's a taichi diagram on the deck.
It could be a trap.
It's just hocus-pocus.
I'm curious to see
what game he's playing.
I know you've agreed to do this.
But you should still be cautious.
How about bringing a few soldiers?
We two have a gentlemen's agreement.
He's come alone.
If I bring soldiers
won't I look like a fool?
My saber.
Father.
Please be careful.
Guard the Pass.
Protect the banner.
Yes, Sir I'll guard
it with my life.
Watch how I teach him a lesson.
Go!
Princess?
Princess.
This is a Pei umbrella
made specially for this duel.
I humbly request the General's
teaching and guidance.
Round One.
I can see
you've taken great pains to prepare.
I couldn't dare do otherwise.
Round Two.
Each man's crossbow
has only 12 arrows.
So move right through, don't bog down.
Young General.
There are enemies in the City.
Remove crossbows.
Open umbrellas.
Fire.
Block.
Ping.
Round Three...
Well done.
Never in our family's history
has anyone survived three rounds
against the Yang saber.
Not bad
I'll save face for you.
Let's call it a
draw and stop here.
Let's go again.
We agreed to duel
to determine a winner.
If we keep going now
it will be for life or death.
Come.
Jing City is taken.
Why doesn't a girl like you
stay home where you belong?
Did you come looking to die?
You've insulted me.
Insulted you?
I don't even know you.
Said you'd make me your concubine.
That was you?
I...
I'm here to give this back to you.
What?
Dear Wife.
Using the Shadow.
Was I right, or wrong?
Some things
don't have a right or wrong.
What's done is done.
Dear Husband.
Here, now.
Let's play our music together.
Jing is taken.
Jing is taken...
- Jing is taken...
- Ping.
Mother.
Commander promised to let me go.
Commander promised to let me go
I've been ordered not to look at your face.
On whose order?
The King's.
He's told me to ask:
Would you like to go back?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Sire...
Princess
used Ping's dagger
to kill him.
Today we celebrate
the reclaiming of our homeland.
The first toast
must go to Commander.
Please wait a moment.
Pei's great hero
will arrive shortly.
As ordered by the King.
Behead him.
Commander has arrived...
Sire
Commander has arrived.
Welcome our Commander.
Humbly
reporting to Sire.
You've fought hard and well.
Please rise and be
seated next to Madam.
Thank you, Sire.
Madam.
You're back...
Yes.
Today Pei has retaken Jing City.
Our Kingdom rejoices.
Per the King's order
the first toast
goes to Commander.
Let's drink another day.
You may all leave now.
The King orders
all to withdraw...
Dear Lu.
You stay.
Come.
Take it.
To your achievements.
Know why I've kept promoting you?
Treated you as my closest confidant?
My deep gratitude for Sire's trust.
What trust?
You
have a special use.
Your secret reports to Yang
made our victory possible.
How much gold did he pay you?
Surprised I killed him myself?
It's because I'm truly happy.
When he conveyed my marriage offer
Yang paid him a bribe, and he came back
proposing my sister be made a concubine
I don't care whose idea it was
I had to take back that pound of flesh.
Now that you're back
my mind is at ease.
You
are a true talent.
Our Kingdom can't do without you.
Alike.
Very much alike.
Don't you agree?
You know.
There's been one thing
weighing on my mind
even more than retaking Jing.
It's been keeping me up at night.
But all I could do was wait...
...wait for you.
You've won my city back for me.
Now let me do something for you.
There's no one here but us.
Let me put this simply.
A fake couple is no
match for a real one.
I will make your wish come true.
And as for Commander.
He wants to be honored forever.
His wish will also come true.
A King's duty
is to make men's dreams come true.
When we step out of
this Hall the world
will know only one Commander.
The obedient and loyal one.
You and I, King and Commander.
The two of us.
What do you say?
I knew you'd come back.
Only a fool wouldn't have.
A young, vital husband
at your side day and night.
What do you say, Madam?
Good.
You've come just in time.
From now on I'll sleep well at night.
No.
Don't you want revenge?
For years
I've been misunderstood.
Finally...
we can both find relief.
Did you all expect
my head to be in the box?
There's something all in Pei know
that only he
never grasped.
It's I...
who am the Heaven of Pei.
Without the real there
can be no "shadow".
A principle no one's understood.
You...
sent assassins to ambush me.
You had Jing's mother killed
and put the blame on me.
How can someone so vile
be King of Pei?
Dear Husband... Never mind me.
I don't have much time left.
Leave all of this
to me.
Jing.
Jing.
Kill him.
Avenge your mother.
Then take Madam with you
I've spent my life
on power games and war.
Never tasted the beauty of the world.
Go live it for me.
Go.
The further the better.
Go.
Commander.
Without the real
there is still a shadow.
You should have grasped this long ago.
Sire..
I'll summon the Palace doctor.
Stay calm.
An assassin attacked our King.
The King is dead.
I, your Commander.
Killed the assassin.
On the spot.
