So you weren't kidding when you
said we were going fishing, huh?
That's what I said, darn it!
Look, this is boring.
Let's go swimming or something.
It's cold. Besides, we passed
a sewer outlet on the way here.
Please!
They don't dump the sewers in this lake!
- They get the water from it.
- Whoa! Hey!
There's something slimy down there.
I don't like it.
Oh, you're trying to scare me.
- Hey!
- Oh! Wayne?
Come on, Wayne.
Cut it out. You're crazy.
Wayne... Wayne?
Wayne, you're making me nervous. Come on.
Will you just stop kidding around?
If you don't stop,
I'm just gonna row away.
Come on, Wayne.
Move it, scumbag!
You son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Hey, hey, Case, come over here.
Come here, Casey.
You're a good dog.
You see that, Casey? Did you see that?
Them goddamn kids could've killed me,
but they didn't. I survived.
Come on, we'll grab a couple of snorts,
and you'll cry on my shoulder,
and I'll cry on yours.
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, oh, OK.
You want a swig, huh? You want a swig?
Come on in. What's the matter?
You don't like my house?
It ain't good enough for you, huh?
Oh, shut up, you goddamn mongrel!
"Eviction notice. Last warning."
You assholes.
Shit! Ugh!
No, no! No! Get off! Not at me! No!
Hey, don't spill any, buddy.
- Just in time.
- I'm very sorry, ma'am.
- Your beer, sir.
- Thank you.
- Mmm.
- Come on, Maureen.
Slow up a little, eh?
Excuse me for trying to have a good time.
- You wanna dance?
- Uh-uh.
What about you, Mike? Wanna boogie?
Oh, no thanks, Maureen.
I'm not much of a dancer.
- That's for sure.
- Terrific!
Another fun-filled night in Ashton. Hmm!
The armpit of America and centre
of boredom for planet Earth, right, honey?
- I think we better go.
- You know, I think you're right.
I've got to see Sheriff Reese
in the morning at Ron Bell's house.
- See you all.
- Bye.
- See you, Mike. Bye, Kim.
- Good night.
- Mike!
- Hey, Don! How are you?
I'm fine.
You guys aren't leaving, are you?
Yeah, I've got an early appointment
first thing in the morning.
Oh, Don, this is my wife, Kim. Kim, Don.
- How do you do, Kim?
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is my wife, Maria.
- Hello.
Hi, Maria. Nice to see you. Uh,
Don's our county sanitation supervisor.
Uh-huh.
Which is just a college-educated way
of saying that I crawl round in sewers,
and that I get paid about a quarter
of what I made as a plumber.
Good to meet you.
Funny, but you don't look anything
like the Wicked Bitch of the North to me.
What?
I'm Rick and Danny's mother.
Oh! Oh, oh. They're in my junior
and senior classes.
They don't like my homework.
- You're sure I can't buy you a drink?
- Oh, no. No thanks.
- We'll see you all later.
- Good night. Nice to see you.
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.
- Michael?
- Yeah?
Do you think Maureen's attractive?
She drinks too much.
That's not what I mean.
Do you like?
Yeah. Very much.
Mmm. Also, don't forget I'm known
as the Wicked Bitch of the North.
I won't forget.
- So, Teacher...
- Mmm...
What do you say we start our homework?
Mary Anne, I can't just drop everything
here, and come home to kill a few snails.
Snails, slugs. What the hell's the
difference? Baby, I'll see you tonight.
- Morning, Mr Brady.
- Good morning, Dobbs.
You're late, Brady.
Uh, go right in.
Give me a break, Sheriff.
It's two minutes after eight.
That's right, son. After eight.
Our appointment was for eight o'clock.
I got a lot more important things to do
than spend my time evicting drunks.
Great. I get your point.
Let's take my car.
Sheriff, you don't mind
if I smoke, do you?
I sure as hell do, Brady.
You can muck up your own lungs,
but don't mess with mine, goddamnit.
- Today's your lucky day, Brady.
- Oh, really? Why's that?
Littering's a $500 fine in this state.
Don't let me catch you doing it again.
Sheriff, you know what they found
in those candies you're eating?
Rat shit and maggots' eggs.
Oh, but Sheriff, littering!
It's a $500 fine.
Son of a bitch.
It doesn't even look like
anyone lives here.
We'll see about that.
There's an open window.
Whew. Look at all this shit.
Man, what stinks like that?
Oh, my God.
Saw nothing like it before.
Not even in 'Nam.
Something ate the sucker's eyes right out.
Not only that, the coroner said his liver,
kidneys and heart are all gone, too.
- Dobbs, get out of my sight!
- Huh?
I said get lost! Damn it!
Sheriff... I'm gonna go back in there.
OK, but don't touch anything.
So, Sheriff, what do you think?
I don't know. Wild dogs maybe. Racoons
driven out of the hills by the cold.
I don't buy that.
Something that big would've done a lot
more damage to the inside of the house.
What's your bright idea,
Mr Health Inspector?
Oh, rats maybe.
Rats?
You willing to go on record with that?
How can I do that?
I'm not sure that it's rats.
Well, there's finally something
you're not sure of. Fancy that!
Excuse me, Mr Brady. Sorry, but it's
that woman on the phone again for you.
- What woman?
- Florence Fortune. Called four times.
What does she want?
Something about the sewers
being backed up.
Oh, Jesus! Now since when are
the goddamn sewers my business?
Tell her to...
to call the Sanitation Department.
Those guys get paid just like we do.
I'm not an idiot, Mr Brady. I've already
told her that, but she won't listen.
All right, I'm sorry.
Put her on the phone.
Yeah. Yes, it's Mike Brady.
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am.
Why don't you just give me
your address then, OK?
- She called the Health Department, too?
- You got it?
- Come on. I'll show you how to do this.
- Great.
- It's gonna be a piece of cake.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hi, ma'am...
- You took your sweet time!
- Hi, Mike Brady. I'd...
- I don't care who you are.
I want something done about that smell.
I'm not on welfare. I pay my taxes.
Do you suppose
we could start at the beginning?
We can start anywhere you want, young man.
As long as we end up getting results!
Didn't you hear about it? It was awful.
Whatever got him
ate his eyes right out of his head.
Or what used to be his head.
His face was all bloody...
For God sakes, Madge, that's enough.
I don't wanna hear any more.
So, we're done. Are you going off
to the moon or going down in the sewer?
You'd be...
You'd be surprised at the similarities.
There's more methane down there
than there is on some of the planets.
Mmm. That's why you got on
the cute mask, huh?
That's one of the reasons.
I've got another suit in the truck
if you wanna come down with me.
Oh, no thanks.
I'm not big on the tight spaces.
Ah, well, I guess that's why
they pay me the big bucks.
I guess so.
And what exactly do you do, hmm?
Right, any thoughts on how Romeo and
Juliet might've solved their problems?
Pam.
Well, I think they should've talked
to their parents about it, you know.
Like, if they would have been honest
with their feelings,
maybe their parents would have understood.
- Fat chance.
- You have something to add, Donna?
Oh, no, Mrs Brady.
Well... parents never seem
to listen to their kids,
unless it's when we're agreeing
with something they've just said.
Hold on. Not so fast.
I want Act Ill read by tomorrow,
and be prepared for a ten-minute quiz.
The Wicked Bitch strikes again.
- Hi, beautiful. How are you?
- Hi, honey.
- All right.
- Where's for lunch?
Well, I had one hell of a morning,
and I'm not too hungry.
Besides, I've gotta check
these new houses after we eat.
Oh, I heard about Ron Bell.
Do you wanna talk about it?
Not if you wanna enjoy your lunch,
I don't.
# You're with me every single day
and every night
# I dream of when you're gone... #
- I got a C.
- You got a C? I got a D.
Those kids hanging around here.
I'm telling you guys. Are you listening?
Something evil got that old wino.
It was the goat killer, I'm telling you.
Don't start that goat killer shit again.
It's not shit. He really exists.
- Who exists?
- The goat killer.
He comes down from the hills at night,
kills people and then he eats them.
Oh, that's gross!
You're on drugs, girl, I swear.
Either that,
or you need professional help.
Laugh if you want, but he's real,
and he got Ron Bell last night.
- He got Ron Bell last night.
- I'm hungry, babe. Get me a burger.
- Will you get me a burger too?
- You wanna a goat burger, babe?
So what's on for tomorrow night?
Some kids are going to a Halloween party.
A Halloween party? I'm not going.
I don't like those wild parties.
- Count me in. Do you wanna go?
- Sure. Why not?
What about the midterm on Monday?
Mrs Brady's? Did you forget?
So? You gonna let that wicked bitch
spoil all your fun? Come on!
Well, we'll see.
Oh, I love the way
you commit yourself to things, Pam!
'Good afternoon. It's a bright
sunny day here in downtown Ashton.
'The birds are singing. The sky's blue...'
- Harold...
- What?
I would just like to know what are these.
Slugs' eggs.
- What?
- Slugs.
I don't care what they are.
Just get rid of them.
And all the plants on the porch
are the same.
Please take care of them.
Get off my back.
I can't stand to look at them
another second! Hmm!
Oh, boy.
Come on, Harold.
...never leave you alone. Women!
There.
Gets more like her mother every day.
Something's biting my hand!
Jean!
Jean!
Jean!
'And now over to the stadium
for today's big game,
'the Ashton Lions versus the...'
Jean!
Jean!
Harold! No!
- How are you?
- Fine.
Did you hear about Harold and Jean Morris?
No. Why?
- They're dead.
- Oh, come on now.
Yeah, I heard it on the news.
There was some kind of an explosion
in their greenhouse.
They were both inside.
Wait a second. How did this happen?
Nobody knows.
Oh, Jesus.
They were nice people.
I... I mean, I liked them a lot.
I know. I did too.
- So what are you doing out here?
- Working in the garden.
- Oh, I see! Now you call this a garden.
- Well...
- What's wrong?
- You see these slime trails everywhere?
Those new houses I was checking out
this afternoon were just full of 'em.
Slime trails. Oh, I saw the biggest slug
in the world before you got home.
Jesus Christ! Those things are big!
- I told you they were big.
- Big? They're gigantic.
Ah! Damn thing bit me!
What kind of a slug bites someone?
I don't know,
but he's living in your garden.
Go get something with a lid on it.
Hurry up! Quick!
Think your English friend
is still in his lab?
- Yeah...
- All right, I'm going.
No, wait!
Oh, shoot!
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.
What's for dinner?
I thought we'd eat light tonight.
Just a big healthy salad.
I was kind of looking forward to a steak.
Hmm... We've been eating
too much red meat lately.
I've got to keep up my strength.
Before you go any further,
you better decide if you want your dessert
before or after the main course.
I was kind of hoping
for some wild hors d'oeuvres.
- Got your keys, right?
- Yeah.
OK. Good. Let's go. Come on.
- John...
- Kim, Mike.
What are you two doing here, eh?
We're sorry to bother you, John,
but, um...
John, I wanna ask you
some questions about these.
What's this?
What is that stuff, anyway?
It's like mucus, you see.
Only the slugs use it as an irritant
for its natural predators.
It is also the way the buggers
get around. They travel on it.
It's like a... like a slimy carpet.
I read somewhere that
you can actually put a snail or slug
on the edge of a razor blade,
and it can crawl right across it
without ever touching the metal.
- Fascinating, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's terrific. How does it eat?
It has three or four rows of teeth
that it uses to grind up its food.
- Which is?
- Greens mainly.
Lettuce, cabbage. Things like that.
Anything that grows in the garden
is a feast for them.
- That's why gardeners hate them so much.
- John, do these things ever eat meat?
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you know, like, meat, animals?
But they're usually only
as big as your thumb, Mike.
However, there are some species,
which do eat tiny worms and insects.
Why do you ask?
John, let's say
I'll call you in the morning, OK?
- All right. Make it after lunch, OK?
- Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.
It's getting late.
What is it? What's wrong?
Just a cramp.
It's gone.
Um, David, I'm sorry for being a bitch
so much of the time.
You're not a bitch.
I think the real problem is...
My drinking. I know.
It's getting the upper hand on me.
Maybe I should see someone about it.
You mean it?
- I can't risk losing you.
- Mmm.
David, what is it?
Another cramp.
- I'm calling the doctor.
- No!
I'm all right. Really. It's past.
Oh... But I've got this strange taste
in my mouth.
Maybe it was the anchovies
that I put in the salad.
Maybe. The salad did taste a little salty.
I'm sorry.
Not your fault. Usually I love 'em.
Why don't you just go on upstairs,
and get into bed?
Soon. I've got to go over these papers
one last time.
I meet with the people
from Calgore tomorrow.
If all goes well, we'll clinch
the shopping deal over lunch.
Knowing you, it'll go terrific.
Hmm. Give me 20 minutes, and I'll be up.
You got a deal. I'll go take my bath.
Come on. Move it, you old farts.
I didn't think your folks
were ever gonna leave.
- Oh, God, you're good.
- Jesus!
What a stash!
Captain Jack. Hello, Captain.
- Do you want some?
- No, I don't.
- Bobby, don't drink.
- Relax! I just want a little bit.
I wonder what your old man
would say if he knew about us.
Oh, he'd probably have a cow.
Yeah, with pink spots.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Oh, Bobby... you know what I want.
Oh, Bobby! Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Oh, Bobby, what's wrong?
Nothing. I just have
to recharge my batteries.
What are you doing?
Nothing, goddamnit!
I just said I need a fucking rest!
Fuck! Something bit me!
Donna!
Fuck!
Donna!
Donna! Fuck!
Donna!
No!
- Bobby!
- Fuck!
Bobby!
Bobby!
No, no, no!
Bobby! Bobby!
Bobby!
Mike, someone on the phone
from the office. How'd that work?
They think this stuff is candy.
Why don't you try salt?
Hey, no, really, that's a good idea.
I'm serious. Good.
Oh, come on!
Hey, what's up? The Sheriff inside?
Yes, he's upstairs.
- Pictures of everything. Understand?
- Sure, Sheriff.
Don't "sure, Sheriff" me,
unless you know you're sure.
I'm sure that I'm sure, Sheriff.
You better be, Dobbs,
or I'll shove my boot so far up your butt,
you'll need a tow truck to get it out.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Who let you in here?
Oh, it's nice to see you too!
You ain't allowed here. What do you want?
Look, Sheriff, I know it sounds
crazier than hell, but I got this theory.
Now, maybe, just maybe we're dealing
with a... a mutant form of slug here.
A kind that eats meat.
Huh! That don't sound crazy, Brady,
that is crazy!
Killer slugs? For Christ's sakes!
What'll it be next? Demented crickets?
Rampaging mosquitos maybe?
All right, all right, all right!
So, you explain the... the slimy shit
on the floor and the dead bodies.
I will, I will. And let me just do my job,
and get out of here.
Yeah, do that.
What are you staring at, goddamnit? You
got nothing better to do than stare at me?
Hi, Julie. Any messages for me?
Don Palmer over at Sanitation
called twice. Says it's very important.
OK. Did a guy named John Foley call?
No, sir.
All right, would you get Palmer
on the phone for me, please?
- Julie?
- Yeah?
Hi! Would you get Palmer
on the phone for me?
Sure. Right away.
You don't have to bite my head off.
I don't bite your head off.
'Yeah, Mike Brady.'
I got some stuff
that you're gonna be interested in.
- What kind of things?
- 'Not over the phone.'
How soon can you get here?
- Jesus, Don! We're not the CIA!
- Half an hour?
- Don, look, I'm...
- 'Mike...'
Listen, my people
have been down in the sewers,
and they have found half-eaten rats and
chickens and cats and even a large dog.
OK, Don, I'm on my way.
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah, a little.
Maybe you should postpone your meeting.
No can do. The clients are coming up
here just for this meeting.
They'll have to sign today.
They're leaving after lunch.
This is the entire sewer map
of the Ashton area.
Now, this gigantic reservoir
takes all the waste from this area
down to Baker's Corner.
Right here is where the Sanitation
Department has its waste disposal plant.
Yeah.
My men were finding
dead animal remains here,
but we've been finding them here too.
Don, I still don't know
what you're driving at.
First it was Ron Bell.
Then it was Talbot and the Moss girl.
- The Moss' house is right here.
- Yeah.
Something's down there killing people.
And there's more you got to know.
Yeah, like what?
When I was researching these maps,
I discovered that in the '50s and '60s
that this entire area,
from the edge of Ron Bell's property line
to the town limits,
was a toxic waste dump.
Every plastic and chemical plant
in the area dumped into it.
Then about 20 years ago they filled it in.
You know, Don Palmer,
you're a fountain of good news.
I'll take mine rare.
- Here you are.
- Sir, would you like an hors d'oeuvre?
- Thank you.
- No, I'm not very hungry.
- Whiskey?
- That's mine. Thank you.
Thank you.
- Anything wrong, Dave?
- No, no. I'm fine.
I just have a blasted headache
that won't go away. Phew.
Maybe we should postpone
until you're better.
Not a chance.
You're not getting out of town
until we've all signed on the dotted line.
Cheers, Dave.
I'll be back in a minute.
- Feel better?
- Yeah, the aspirins are finally working.
- Good, good. Drink up, then.
- Excuse me.
Mmm. Shall we tell him now,
or wait until the cheque comes?
There we are.
Might as well tell him now.
Who knows? It just might clear up
his headache once and for all.
And yours.
We've decided to go full steam ahead
with the project.
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's terrific! Great!
You know you'll never regret it.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Uh, to the beginning
of all the great things yet to come.
Cheers.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
This is it.
This is where they've filled it in.
It's the exact centre of where
they plan to put that shopping centre.
Oh, my God.
See where it is in relationship
to Ron Bell's house?
Yeah, so?
There's a possibility that the bulldozer
broke through the landfill.
Who knows what poisonous gases escaped?
Jesus, Don, you could be right.
Yeah, Sanitation Department.
Um, excuse me. Just a minute, please.
It's for you. It's your office.
Yes, Julie, it's Mike.
'Your wife called.'
Oh, and Sheriff Reese called. He said
to get over to Trombino's right away.
Mr Brady,
the Sheriff's waiting for you inside.
Uh, I'll check with the guys in white.
You crazy? We got no worms here.
- We got worms here?
- Worms?
His mum has more worms...
- What's he saying?
- He says we got no worms here.
He wants worms...
I give him... right up in his...
Relax, relax.
The worms that killed that boy didn't just
roller-skate here and jump on his plate.
About time. I'm doing your job for you.
This is a matter
for the Health Department.
We found these on the plate.
My guess is they came from the food.
I got no worms in my food.
I got no worms here!
Sure, sure. Well?
Well, what? Who died?
I thought you knew.
A friend of yours. Dave Watson.
- What?
- Well, do I close this place, or what?
- I don't know that yet.
- Tell me if they came from the food.
How should I know?
Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.
Why don't you just give me five minutes,
and I'll figure it out?
Terrific! That's wonderful!
Mike, what did you find in there?
I don't know.
Maybe some kind of food poisoning.
Food poisoning?
Mike, I was in there. I saw that guy.
His face was eaten away.
His eyes were popping out.
- I'm not an expert...
- That's right.
We'll take it over to Foley,
and see what he has to say about it.
Good God.
Where'd you get these?
Come on, John.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
"The schistosomes are blood flukes,
"a particularly virulent
strain of parasite
"found in the blood streams
of... of slugs."
Now tell me where you got them.
Well, they came
from... Dave Watson's head.
Oh, God.
There's no end to his thing.
What do you mean?
First, they are carnivorous.
No doubt about that.
Their slime produces an irritant,
that given in large enough doses, kills.
After paralysing. And now this...
Parasites natural to them can be
transmitted and are lethal to humans.
On top of that, slugs are hermaphrodites.
Hermaphro-what?
Hermaphroditic. Which means
they can fertilise their own eggs.
Speaking of which, where do they breed?
Well, anywhere it is dark and moist.
They're primarily night creatures.
How about a sewer?
Well... Well, as a breeding ground...
Yes, it would be perfect.
- Thank God! I've been trying to find you!
- What's wrong?
Call Mrs Brady. She's called three times.
She's scared to death.
Hello?
Oh, Michael, where have you been?
- What's wrong?
- Please come home. Hurry.
Kim? What is it?
What is it?
Be careful!
- What is it? What are you talking about?
- There.
Oh, my God.
Be careful.
- Michael, who are you calling?
- Sheriff Reese.
He damn well better talk to me now.
Dobbs, it's Mike.
Put Sherriff Reese on the phone.
He ain't here. He's out at Ashton Farms.
We got us another dead body over there.
- You what?
- 'Amazing, ain't it?'
The most exciting thing we had
around here was a Saturday-night drunk
getting naked
and running down main street.
Now we got a new dead body
showing up every ten minutes.
Look, now, listen to me, Dobbs.
You tell that fast bastard
to get his ass over
to Frank Phillips' office immediately.
You got that?
Look, I have to go now.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Michael, I think I'm losing my mind.
Just hang in there. You'll be fine.
How? How am I gonna do that?
Tell Mr Phillips that
Mike Brady is here to see him.
- Hey, his office is closed.
- Yeah, watch me.
You can't go in there.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We have an emergency on our hands.
Should I call the police, Mr Phillips?
That won't be necessary, Miss Wiley.
Thank you. What is this, Brady?
I want you to cut off the water in the
south-end section of town immediately.
Is this your idea of a joke, huh?
No, it's not my idea of a joke.
Now, the water in that section of town
has been contaminated
by a mutated form of slug.
If we don't shut the system down,
and I mean now,
we risk contaminating the entire city.
Hold on. Mutated slugs?
Contaminated water system?
What the hell are you talking about?
Phillips, listen to me.
We're facing a disaster here.
You need a long vacation, pal.
This is no time to argue.
Who's arguing?
I'm telling you you're nuts.
We'll declare a health emergency.
I'll take full responsibility.
You ain't got the authority to declare
"happy birthday"! Not in this town!
Oh, you crazy son of a bitch!
What's it gonna take?
For starters, a request from the mayor.
Then my concurrence!
Now, get your ass out of here!
Mutated slugs...
Crazy asshole.
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.
Then can I go to lunch?
OK, go.
Everything Mr Watson promised
Calgore Corporated will remain.
That's the way Mr Watson did his business,
and the kind of man he was.
He'll be greatly missed.
God, you never saw anything
like what happened in that restaurant.
- Oh, put it out of your mind, Sue.
- How? His whole face was...
Uh, can I freshen your drinks?
I sure hope things like that
don't happen around here again.
Huh, what?
Uh, M-Miss Channing, I assure you...
- Forget it.
- Sue, I think it's time we got going.
Well, of course. I only thought you people
were prepared to sign the papers.
Why not? We might as well... do it.
- Yes?
- Sorry, Mr Mayor.
Mike Brady of the Health Department
is here. He says it's an emergency.
Tell him it'll have to wait. I'm in
the middle of an important conver...
Sorry, Mr Mayor,
but what I have to say can't wait.
We have a potential disaster on our hands.
Potential disaster?
Uh, excuse me. I won't be a minute.
Who the hell do you think you are
to burst in here like this?
Look, you've got to call Frank Phillips.
Tell him to shut down the water system.
- What?
- We have slugs in our water.
We've got to contain them to the sewers,
or we don't stand a chance.
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but you're gonna have
to listen to me and trust me.
What happened to Ron Bell, Donna
Moss and Dave Watson are all related,
and it's only the beginning.
Sure, Mr Brady, sure. Anything you say.
Look, goddamnit, don't patronise me.
I'm not insane.
Insane? I never said that you were!
Look, put down the phone.
Are you gonna start listening to me?
Sorry to interrupt,
but we have a plane to catch.
- Are you from Calgore?
- Yes, I am.
Get Sheriff Reese. I want him here now.
My name is Mike Brady,
and I am the county health inspector,
and like I was trying to tell the mayor,
we have a very serious situation
on our hands here.
Situation? What kind of situation?
This entire area used to be
a toxic waste dump,
and not only that,
we have a mutant form of killer slug
in our water system.
- A toxic waste dump?
- Yes.
That's bullshit! This man's nuts.
God knows what his game is.
My game is, like what you would call it,
is to save lives.
You mean to tell me
if I turn on the water tap,
a killer slug is gonna
come out and get me?
Well... let's just see.
We have nothing to hide in this town.
Shall we finish signing the papers?
Absolutely.
Well, there's no time like the present.
- Sure. Let's get it done with.
- OK.
You're not gonna sign this thing, are you?
Huh, now then, Mr Brady,
if you don't mind,
let us get on with our business.
You people are unbelievable.
Thank you.
Mr Phillips? I'm back.
Mr Phillips?
Are you OK there?
Mr Phillips?
Now, watch this.
- Well, what do you think?
- It's fantastic, Foley.
- What is that stuff?
- It's a lithium-based arsenic.
Lithium is highly combustible
when it comes into contact with moisture.
Yeah, but can you make enough of that
to kill thousands of slugs?
Well, making the stuff's no problem,
but to get all of them in one place
at the same time,
that's quite something else.
Well, I'm convinced that
their main nest is in the sewers
near Ron Bell's old house.
Now, the problem is, can we use this
without blowing up the whole town?
Well, I hope so.
You know something?
I think it's worth a try.
What do you say we meet at
the Sanitation Department in three hours?
It's going to take me some time.
John, just be there.
All right. I'll be there.
Ready... set... huh!
Come on, Dad!
- Mike, what's up?
- Uh, let's go inside, and I'll tell you.
Guys, we're gonna have to hang it up.
- We got to go anyway.
- Go where?
- To a Halloween party.
- What Halloween party?
- Some guys are getting together.
- Just make sure...
To be home early.
- What's up?
- Uh, it's not great news.
Don?
- Oh, hi, Maria. Mike just stopped by.
- Hi, Maria.
- Hi, Mike. Happy Halloween.
- Same to you.
Want some coffee?
Uh, no. No thanks.
We're gonna be in the den.
- So, what's up?
- Well, Don, I...
- I need your help.
- Sure.
I'm going down to the sewers
after the slugs.
Oh...
Yeah, I spoke to this guy, Foley,
and he found stuff that'll kill them.
What kind of stuff?
It's a chemical.
It'll... make them explode.
- Explode?
- Yeah.
It reacts to the moisture in their bodies.
Let me get this straight.
You wanna take something that explodes,
when it comes in contact with water,
down into the sewer?
- Mmm-hmm.
- You're crazy.
Don, we have no alternative.
I've been to the mayor,
and I've been to the Sheriff,
and nobody wants to listen.
Now, these things are coming out
of the water taps in my neighbourhood.
Right. You imagine
if they spread to the entire system.
Let's get started, partner.
You don't want any more time
to think about this?
I don't need to think about it.
I've got a wife and two kids too.
And I don't want what happened
to Watson happening to one of them.
Good.
Um... I'm... I'm gonna go out for a while.
- You'll be long?
- No, I don't think so.
Where are you going?
To tell you the God's honest truth,
Brady and I are gonna go
and kill some man-eating slugs.
Oh, I trust these so-called
killer slugs of yours
aren't 18 years old and speak French?
No!
But I'll tell you what...
when I do get back,
how about if we get naked and get crazy?
Hmm. I'll be here.
Kim?
Kim?
Kim, are you here?
Kim?
Kim?
- Mike? Where are you?
- Kim, is that you?
- Kim! Oh, God! Am I glad to see you!
- You too, honey.
- Where were you?
- I was at Maureen's.
Oh, Michael, she's in terrible shape.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't wanna scare you.
Now, I want you to go to your mother's.
- Wait for me there. I'll be there soon.
- I want you to go now!
Kim, this thing's turned
into a total disaster.
Do as I say. Go to your mother's.
I don't want to be without you.
Understand?
Yes, I understand.
See? They're all over the place.
Come on. Let's go.
OK, now everything's gonna be OK.
Just get your things. Let's go.
I still can't believe Bobby's dead.
- Don't think about it.
- It was that goddamn goat killer.
I'd like to get my hands on him.
What are you gonna do? Bore him to death?
OK, smartass, then you tell me
what happened to Bobby and Donna.
- Keep quiet! I'm leaving.
- Don't worry. He's upset about Bobby.
- You ready?
- Depends on what you mean by "ready".
Well, we should have enough to do it.
I hope so, 'cause we're only getting
one shot at this.
Is this, uh, my little suit?
There are miles of sewers down there.
Those things could be anywhere.
Right. That's why we're gonna get 'em
all in one place.
How are you gonna do that,
invite them over for a hamburger?
Something like that.
We're, uh, gonna give 'em a little bait.
I hope you don't mean
what I think you mean.
No. I got something better than that.
I told you
I didn't want to come to this party.
Come on. It's a Halloween party.
How can you not be having fun?
I feel awkward.
I'm hardly dressed for this.
- You look fine. Have a couple of beers.
- Have some pizza.
- I don't want any pizza!
- Try it!
- Bug off!
- Could we go?
Yeah. Punk!
- Stop it, Danny!
- I thought you liked me.
Well, of course I like you.
But liking you and letting you get into
my panties is a different kind of thing!
I wish you wouldn't put it that way.
How would you like me to put it?
That we have something special.
You do like me, don't you?
Well, not that much.
I said no!
What's the use?
All you wanna do is play mind games.
- Well, count me out!
- Fine!
So what?
OK, guys, this is it.
Now, we can go underground right here.
And from everything I can put together,
I have to guess that
their main body is right here.
Now, there's a manhole cover
right above this chamber.
OK, John, you position yourself
by the manhole.
You get ready to drop your stuff.
Any strays we see,
we push into that chamber.
Now, when we're ready to get out,
we'll signal you.
Mmm-hmm. Right.
- We're all set. Just one more thing.
- What's that?
Once we're in the chamber,
you give us two minutes to get out.
If we don't get out, you drop the stuff.
Understand?
Yes.
It's this way.
- I can't wait.
- I know. It's gonna be so killer.
- Want a beer?
- Nah.
- Where's Pam?
- I told her to get lost.
- You what?
- Yeah, she's a real bitch.
You're an asshole. Right down to steerage.
- Where are you going?
- None of your goddamn business.
- I can't believe that.
- What's up with him?
Son of a bitch.
They closed the entrance
without marking it on the map.
What do we do now?
There's another way in from section G13,
but it's a long way around.
- No other way?
- There's no other way.
Well, let's go then.
Sure this is the way?
Yeah, the entrance is right up ahead.
Pam! Pam!
Where are you, Pam?
Pam!
Pam!
Pam! Pam!
We're taking a right just up ahead.
Just watch yourself.
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?
Jeez, it's worse than I thought.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- No, no. I got an idea. Here. Hold this.
Oh, shit.
You're not gonna light that blowtorch.
You're crazy.
These sewage gases could be explosive.
Don't worry.
This section has plenty of ventilation.
I'm gonna electrocute the bastards.
We're gonna get fried. Come on! Let's go!
Come on!
Watch out for that pipe.
- Goddamnit.
- What?
This shouldn't even be here.
It isn't even on the map.
Best I can figure were about
underneath that... that old factory.
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing else we can do.
We just have to go on.
Let me call Foley,
and let him know we're on our way.
Foley, this is Brady. Come in.
Yeah, Mike. I'm here. I'm near
the rendezvous. Everything OK?
We're just about
at the entrance of the old factory.
- What?
- Meet us at the sewer entrance
at the old factory in just a few minutes.
We'll be there as soon as we can.
Right. I'm on my way.
Over.
- Are we out of here?
- Yeah. Let's go.
There's a million of 'em down here.
Come on, take out the torch,
and use it now.
Can't. There's enough methane down here
to blow us all the way to Kentucky.
Well, is there another way to go?
Not that I know about.
Oh, man.
It's getting real tight down there.
How much farther?
Not far.
What is it? What's wrong, Palmer?
- They're right up ahead.
- Come on now, Palmer. Move it.
- Maybe you didn't hear what I said.
- I hear you. I said move!
Come on, Palmer! Go!
Quick! Get out of here!
Mike, do you read me?
I'm at the old factory now.
I'll open the manhole.
Over and out.
My God! This has got to be it!
We're right underneath that old factory.
Foley... Foley, come in. This is Mike.
We've found their main breeding ground.
Now, get all that stuff ready.
We're gonna try to find a way out of here.
Mike, come on! I've found a way!
Will you drop that stuff? Come on!
Come on!
This is it.
Yeah.
But how are we gonna get over there?
The sack.
You're right. The sack.
I'll go get the meat.
I'll be right back.
This ought to distract them for a minute.
Toss the whole thing in.
Whoa!
- Now what are we gonna do?
- We gotta go back that way.
We can't go back. Look.
Take this. I got an idea.
Mike, get on the phone and call Foley.
Tell him to pour that stuff
down the manhole.
- We'll get out this way.
- Foley...
Foley, it's Brady. Come in.
Don!
Don, give me your hand.
Don, do you hear me?
Help me!
Don, give me your hand!
Don!
Don!
Mike! Mike! Help me!
Come on!
Mike, get out! Get out!
- Are you all right, Mike?
- Do it, Foley!
- But Palmer... Where is he?
- Do it!
Go on! Pour it in!
Go on, Foley! Do it! Now!
I'm sorry about your friend, Brady.
You... You can go to hell.
Mike... he knew the chances.
I could've kept him out of this.
No, I don't think you could. He knew that.
We could never have done it
without him, Mike.
That's a small comfort now.
- Mike!
- Kim!
