Then I got a job at Siba.
I stayed two weeks and then quit.
-Why did you quit?
-The boss was a fucking idiot.
He couldn't cooperate.
-And then you went to...?
-Elgiganten.
-I was there for maybe five...days.
-And why did you leave?
That boss was a total fucking idiot.
Impossible to deal with.
So let me guess,
next you went to Expert?
No, Media Markt.
That was kind of fun.
But I had a boss there
who was just...an idiot.
Try this. You draw what you think
your future is like in a year.
I'll go out a bit. If I'm not back
when you're done, draw two years.
-Sven? Do you have a minute?
-Yes.
Elin has resigned. She's starting
her own life coaching company.
So my question to you is,
would like to be head work coach?
-You're asking me?
-You're single, no family.
No private life to speak of.
You can put in long hours
and I want to give you a shot.
-Nice.
-You get a company car.
-Yeah. I'll take a shot.
-Good.
Then I want you
to take a couple of classes.
One to be a stress consultant and one
on clothing and body language.
I was considering
those classes anyway.
-And your salary adjustment?
-I'll have to get back to you on that.
Our motto here is not to put off until
tomorrow what we can do today.
Let me do some math.
Seven-eight thousand.
A bit much, perhaps. Five thousand.
Considering the current market,
I imagine that four makes sense.
I think we should
meet halfway and say two.
Yes, let me do the math.
I think we can meet at two.
-You're tough!
-You think so?
-Welcome aboard.
-Thanks. Sorry to be so tough.
You know how it is in this business,
you have to be harsh.
It warms my heart to meet people
who during Christmas have the guts
to go their own way.
A warm hand for Johan Påhlman.
Well, look at that! Johan Påhlman!
You'll be doing something dangerous.
Yes, I'll be BASE jumping.
Parachuting off the Kaknäs Tower.
-You're doing it for a reason.
-Yes, against violence.
Against violence, that's fantastic.
I've heard that when you're not
jumping, you've written a book?
Yes, I've written a book.
It's about a guy who leaves the
rat race and focuses on living life.
Of course you wrote a book.
He frees himself. He "Cuts the
Cords", like the title of the book.
-Sounds like it's about you.
-Indeed.
-Hi, darling.
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, sis.
-You look stressed.
-No. Did you already order?
-It's a Christmas buffet.
So, how is the love life?
You don't want to be an old dad.
-Did you see Johan Påhlman on TV?
-Yes, I saw that.
I knew he'd do well. Remember
playing together as kids?
-You were so cute then.
-Mom!
You're not allowed to smoke now.
I don't get that law at all.
-What's Johan doing?
-Everything Sven dreamed of.
-Traveling, exploring, writing.
-My dream at age 15.
Like your father said: giving up on
your dreams is giving up on life.
-And that's why he killed himself.
-He didn't! The gun misfired.
You know, I'm actually thinking
of writing a book too.
Yes. He can write a journal.
-Write a journal, Sven.
-No. I'm getting some food.
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.
-What could that be?
-I have no idea.
-Was it good?
-Look, you can swim there!
Okay, girls. I've looked over the times
and I figured
since the plane leaves at 4 PM
we'll meet at the airport at 1 PM.
And on Tuesday they have a great
cooking course on the beach.
-Are you in?
-I think I'll pass.
-But why?
-You're riding the elephants, right?
We can do that when the guys arrive.
-You'll want time with Fredrik.
-There's plenty of time.
Robert and I got engaged
our first trip to Thailand.
-Right, you did.
-Aren't you thinking of that?
No, we haven't.
The pressure is just constant.
I can't handle them being so hateful.
That they're angry
that I'm doing my job.
This doesn't suit me.
I'm too nice to be a traffic warden.
You need to take charge of your life.
The parking doesn't matter.
You need to do your job. You're not
some kind of wimp. Say it.
-You are not some kind of wimp.
-Except about you.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I am not a wimp. I am not a wimp.
I worked full time a while back.
That was in 1991.
That's when it happened,
the first time I just collapsed.
I had to stay at home for a while
then came back to work again.
I worked quarter time, but it didn't
take long for it to happen again.
But I didn't give in, tried again and
was working again a few years later.
And then I worked 10% of full time.
But that just wore me out completely.
If you could decide,
what would you do today?
I do want to go back to work,
maybe three or four percent.
Maybe from home.
-Hi.
-Are you leaving?
-I wanted to speak with you.
-Tomorrow.
-Hi, Bosse!
-Hello, Sven. Hello.
-What are you doing?
-Fine is 700 for stopping here.
Don't tell me how to do my job!
Right. Good.
-Tomorrow at 2 PM, then?
-Yes.
-Just hit "quick start".
-Oh. I was going to do intervals.
I see.
What are you reading?
Something you've written?
No.
-What is that?
-It's a script. I'm a reader.
-What does a reader do?
-Read submissions for the publishers.
Interesting, because I'm a writer.
I'm on my way to being one.
I have an idea for a book right now.
Please, don't do it.
-Here's the quick pitch.
-No, really. Don't.
It's about the man
in Sweden of today...
How hard it is to be a man today.
A gender in crisis.
A confused sex searching for its
place in a post feminist world.
No. Yes. More about the polarization.
Between the sexes.
The man is the new woman.
You know what?
I get that pitch twice every day.
The woman is the new man and you
don't realize what insights I have...
-Are you okay?
-What? I'm doing intervals.
-Hi.
-Hi, darling.
What's the matter?
Do you know what I feel when
I look at you? Unbelievable warmth.
Damn, I love you so much.
And you know what?
I have a surprise for you.
No surprises. I don't like surprises.
-We'll see about that.
-You're not pregnant, are you?
Of course I'm not pregnant,
I'm a man!
-So what's the surprise?
-Just wait, you'll see.
Are we breaking in?
Of course not! I'd never
break in somewhere.
-Welcome.
-Thank you... to what?
-To our home. Welcome home.
-What?
I've bought this house for us.
Darling, don't thank me.
I simply felt that someone
had to take control of our situation.
Hey, Anja.
This isn't what you want.
Reading submissions all day.
You could change the world with me.
Let's start our own company.
Fredrik and I bought a house.
So I can't afford to
change the world right now.
-Let's see, that's a lot of papers.
-You were a doctor, right?
Yes, at Södersjukhuset.
I was at Danderyd before.
I have something in my shoulder,
it clicks when I play golf.
I'm a gynecologist.
So, there's that.
-Do you want a pen?
-No.
-You need one to sign.
-Fredrik, I need a break.
Of course. I thought we'd go
celebrate a little later.
I want a break from you.
-What?
-She wants to take a break.
I'm sorry, Fredrik.
-What happened?
-She broke up with him.
She wanted a break.
Hell of a difference.
So what happens with the trip?
-What do you think? I cancelled it.
-Why? Come with us.
-You need it now.
-Alone with two couples?
The first week is just us three.
And the kids, of course.
You're just exhausted or something.
Take it easy and
make the most of the crisis.
You'll probably realize
that Fredrik's perfect.
And then you just commit.
You have to, sooner or later.
Adventurer Johan Påhlman died
today, preparing for a BASE jump.
This piece contains
some graphic images.
-Johan, get your parachute on!
-I'm just finishing the blog.
There, finished. Let's do this!
Johan? Johan!
Johan Påhlman was 35 years old.
Next, the weather report.
Mom, please put it out.
There are children here.
Påhlman's mom,
what do I say to her?
You don't need to say much.
-Look how old she's become.
-And you think you look fresh?
Few of us have the amazing energy
and appetite for life that Johan had.
How many of us have climbed K2?
I have not.
Johan was the first one ever
to climb Mount Everest-
-without any Gore-Tex
materials whatsoever.
God loves those he takes too young,
and God loved Johan.
Because he made the most of his life.
The Lord loved Johan
because he didn't let himself
be placed into some sort of system.
As Johan often asked his friends:
Do you live the life you want to live?
Johan did. And Christ did.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Sven Becker.
-Druve Lundelius... It's been ages.
It's good to...
Well, what can you say? It's sad.
We shouldn't mourn Påhlman.
He'd experienced so much.
-I think he was satisfied.
-Yes, but...
Johan used you as an example
when he spoke of choices.
He'd say that either you do
a Sven Becker or cut the cords.
-He said it with great warmth.
-Johan was always warm.
So, what is freedom, really?
To me, freedom is economic
independence.
Should you go right? Left?
Neither, Johan said.
He always found
the path going forward.
He didn't follow this.
He followed this.
That's something
that made me change my life.
I have one tiny advantage
over Johan.
-I am alive.
-Are you?
Are you okay?
How did you know Johan?
Old friend, I hadn't seen
him in ages.
He was a fantastic human being.
I work at his dive center in Phuket.
I'm going back to Thailand tomorrow.
I can't live in Norway.
Snow, ice and cheery attitudes.
-Do you understand me?
-No. Not a word.
But Mom is from Norway
and I don't understand her either.
-It's nice to be able to just go.
-So do it.
I just got promoted, so the timing
is bad. Otherwise I would do it.
Promote your life.
You have to follow your heart.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know
what's wrong with me.
Good luck.
Good, there you are.
Well, don't you look happy.
So? It was a lovely funeral.
Which is your fault. I'm fully aware
that it couldn't have worked out.
You could have told me
what kind of boss it was.
She was nuts. What a fucking idiot.
You know what?
I think you should just quit working.
-Yes.
-Yes? Of course!
-I had thought about that.
-Right? Do it!
-Where are you going?
-I'm quitting too. Good luck!
Good, Sven! This is Lena
and she's looking for a new job.
-No, I don't think so. Just quit.
-Sven?
Yes. I'm quitting. Here are
the Volvo keys and my cards
and there's a parking ticket on
the car, but I think you can handle it.
-Bye!
-What?
-Vacation?
-Yes.
It'll be nice to get there,
away from all this crap.
-Know what a beer costs there?
-No.
Five crowns.
Ten beers for 50 crowns.
Twenty beers for 100 crowns.
A hundred beers for 500 crowns.
A thousand beers for 5,000 crowns!
Right, Sven.
You'd booked a bungalow.
Of course you want a bungalow,
come with me.
-So, Sven. Did you bring your family?
-No, I'm on my own. I'm here to work.
-Adventurer?
-Author, actually.
-Mountain climbing is very inspiring.
-I can imagine.
-6: 30 tomorrow, a group is going up.
-Not for me, thanks.
You're worried about an accident.
That almost never happens.
Here are some forms to fill out.
Breakfast? We leave early.
You want climbing gear. Insurance,
in case of a serious accident.
Cancellation insurance. If you change
your mind about going climbing.
-But I don't want to climb.
-I see!
Sorry, it's my bad temper.
You remind me of my dad.
We had a really difficult...
Never mind. Number two.
Welcome, Sven.
-Thanks!
-Hey. Do you dive?
-Yes, I'm certified.
-Great! We go Friday at 6: 30.
I'll sign you up. If you don't want to
come, tell me before Thursday lunch.
Otherwise, there's a small fee.
Okay?
Hey, Sven! If there's anything
you need, talk to George. Welcome!
Number two.
-Hello!
-Hi!
-You came!
-Yes.
I was done with Sweden.
I had nothing left to do there.
It's great to take charge of
your life and follow your dreams.
-You think so?
-You're brave.
Yeah, well. Hey.
-I'm Sven, by the way.
-Sorry, hi. I'm Gitte.
-Nice shells.
-Let's go swimming.
-Last one in is a halibut!
-I don't want to be a halibut!
Now that's cool.
You'd never see that in Sweden.
Swedes are so terribly boring.
That's the kind of thing
you should live for, Sven.
Imagine if you left tourism and
immersed yourself in Eastern culture.
That's exactly what I want. I'll just
be positive and say yes to everything.
-Want to go climbing tomorrow?
-No.
That's not really my thing. I'm more...
Yes. Of course. Of course I'm going.
I really need a challenge.
What the hell? That's dangerous!
You have to have safety distance!
I'm sorry I got mad like that, I guess
I still have a Western mind set.
It's okay, you just got here today.
Sorry, did you see that?
-Yes, sarongs are sexy.
-Yes indeed. Cool outfit.
-This is my place.
-How nice!
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
-You make me woozy.
-Yeah? What's that mean?
-Oh, flipsy?
-Exactly. I feel the same.
See you for climbing
tomorrow morning. Goodbye.
-Sleep well.
-Sleep well.
-Nice sarong.
-Thanks.
-Is it new?
-No, it's one of my oldest sarongs.
You're late. You've missed
the entire safety run-through.
It's the most important thing all day.
You'll do it throughout the day.
That's good, Sven!
That won't work, try to use the whole
body, not just your arms.
Look at Gitte, you want your body
to be just that light.
Are you holding on firmly?
Hey!
Hey, are you paying attention?
Please! Focus on what you're doing!
I'm busy down here.
Oh, sorry.
-Are you okay? Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm good, thanks.
-Come up and get a kiss.
-Okay.
Sven!
You got a little ride there
on your first climb.
-What the hell are you doing?
-Just hold on, I've got it.
You can feel completely safe.
You didn't handle that well.
Do you feel you were in control?
Whoa there.
Are you questioning my safety
while wearing a picnic blanket?
-Sven.
-No.
I thought not. Sorry.
It kind of sounded like you did.
-Two questions for you. Are you hurt?
-No.
And did you have fun? You bet.
Come here, buddy. Come here.
Now I have to eat something.
Hands out and
then to the sides, Sonja.
-Have you heard from Fredrik?
-He texted me earlier.
I've said this before,
but I'll say it again.
You have to dare to commit. Once
you do, it becomes the right thing.
Like Robert and me. I just decided.
What I love most about him
is his sense of humor.
-Really?
-What do you mean, really?
I didn't realize that
was his strong point.
When he does impersonations
of funny characters, you just die.
"Shut up."
Well, he does it a lot better.
If you go through the resort,
the bungalow is on the right.
-You don't have to do that, kid.
-Right.
-Bye!
-Bye.
-Well, it's you!
-Hi there, girl from the gym.
-Are you staying here at the resort?
-No.
I'm a bit up the beach,
away from the tourists.
How's that man book coming along?
Well, I don't want
to talk about that with you.
Okay. Well, have a good time.
It's going well, I just haven't gotten
far. I'm waiting for inspiration.
-But I know what I'm going to write.
-Great. Good luck.
I'm sorry for saying this
but it's easy for you to have a
superior attitude, you're on vacation.
-What did you say?
-No, it wasn't about you.
That tone deaf idiot is starting again.
-Hi.
-Hello!
-Nice.
-Thanks. My grandmother taught me.
A little ditty about a girl
who lives on a farm
but is forced to move
and then everyone dies.
God damn.
-Want to get a colonic tomorrow?
-Why would I do that?
Do you know how much crap
there is in your colon?
But isn't that where it's supposed
to be? In the bowels?
Oh my god!
Hello, puppy.
Do you really want to...? I just...
Come on. The time has arrived.
Sven. You're going to do something
you've never done before.
Sit up.
It'll feel a little strange,
but you'll be reborn afterward.
Are you ready? Close your eyes.
Imagine that you are resting
comfortably in my womb.
No, I'm not doing that.
But you said you were ready
to try new things.
Open your mind. You lay there
and it's so warm
cozy and wet and nice inside
Gitte's fresh Norwegian uterus.
But you can't stay,
you have to come out.
You are born through my opening.
I'll push you out.
You are born again, Sven.
-That fucking hurts!
-You can do it!
Now cry like a baby.
Cry like a baby!
Should we call the police?
-Do you want to nurse?
-No, I don't want to.
I want to ride on that.
You can't ride,
but you can sit on it.
Oh, that's my phone. Wait.
- Hi, Karin!
Help!
-Anja, hello? Where did you go?
-I'm here.
-I'll fix this!
-Sonja can't talk right now.
No, she's just met up
with a friend here.
I'll call if...when she comes back.
Mommy!
Hello! Don't be scared,
I'm not dangerous.
Let go of the gas!
I said let go of the gas.
Stay there, Sven. I've got this.
-That was lots of fun!
-Thank you for your help.
It was nothing.
Sonja, we won't tell mommy.
It'll be our secret, okay?
-Thanks.
-I didn't do a thing.
-You tried, that's something!
-You're welcome.
I know, it's hard to be a man.
-It actually is.
-How's it going?
-Quite well, I have the foreword.
-That is good.
I've written the word "foreword".
-So who's daddy to that one?
-Zlatan.
-Really?
-No.
She's not mine.
Her mom's over at the resort.
-Let's go.
-Don't stress over writing. It'll come.
-What's your name?
-Anja.
-And yours?
-Sven!
...Becker.
Give me a hand here.
You take the handle bars.
-We rode a jet ski!
-What? You took her on a jet ski?
I went myself. It just started.
One guy came to save me-
-but he fell, so another guy
came and saved me.
We had some bad luck.
Sonja stole a jet ski and took a trip.
-Oh my god, Anja!
-It was an accident.
Are you crazy? Don't you see
what could have happened?
-I just looked away for one second.
-You don't do that with a child. Never!
Come on!
No, we're ignoring the animals.
You wouldn't know, without kids.
But it was a bit irresponsible.
Fruit?
-Hey, dude. Writing a masterpiece?
-No, not tonight.
Give me a hand. Kim stepped on
a sea urchin during night diving.
She needs to get
to the medical station.
-I can't leave the group on the boat.
-I see...
It's right behind the resort, with one
of those plus signs on the door.
Yes, the hospital symbol.
I've seen those.
-Sure.
-Great. Very nice.
-I'm Swedish too.
-Great, okay.
Poor thing. Here, this way.
-Let me carry you.
-Gladly. Thank you.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Where are you headed?
-I'm going to eat.
It's amazing how cheap it is
here in Thailand.
It's below freezing at home.
-See you later.
-Right.
-Why didn't you speak?
-I don't know her.
It would be nice if she knew
which language you speak.
-Oh, hello!
-Coming deep sea diving today?
Deep what?
I'm asking if you want to
come deep sea diving today?
Find out how deep we can go.
I don't want to do more dangerous
things, I'm here to write. Accept that.
Oh, the big author, Sven.
-Hello!
-Hi!
-Are you going diving?
-She is, I'll mostly snorkel.
-Come on.
-What?
-We were going diving, right?
-Yes.
Have you seen
Mahatma Gandhi over there?
-I have to tell you something.
-What is it?
Tonight, I will go into silence.
This means I won't speak for a week
to find my inner self.
And I hope we can be together even
if I don't say a word all week.
I'll have to try to live through it.
Sven, hi! Thanks for last night.
-No worries. How's the foot?
-It hurts a little, but is almost well.
-Pull it together.
-Yeah, yeah.
-You okay? Are you seasick?
-No.
I've done Afro Dance for five years.
I've got really excellent balance.
I don't get seasick.
But I can get a little woozy.
I'll get you some water.
-Do you have time for this?
-You've got to do research too.
-Who's the little girl?
-I helped her to the medical center.
-She'd stepped on a sea urchin.
-No, the other one.
That's my little...sister.
Must be fun to travel with your sister.
You must be close.
Yeah, we're pretty close.
What about you? Any siblings?
-Two, but we're not that close.
-No.
Excuse me, did you say 600 minutes?
Sorry, 60 minutes.
Sorry. So, half an hour.
Come with me, I saw
a hammerhead down there.
-Where?
-Right here!
-I'll start here on the surface.
-Okay, see you later.
Wait, I'm coming.
-Thanks for the help.
-It seemed mean to leave you there.
-Yeah, that was nice.
-Are you okay?
Where's the boat?
-Where's the boat?
-Did they forget us?
Help! Help!
I am shushing, I am calm!
-Hello!
-Quiet, that doesn't help.
-What is it in Thai?
-Breathe.
It's kind of cool to have this
as my workplace.
-I get that. Is this your boat?
-Yeah, or...you could say that.
What do you do?
Recruitment. Incredibly boring.
I would like to get away.
Didn't two people
die this way in a film?
Can we pick
a different film to talk about?
That's the only one I can think of.
That one and Jaws.
Sven, I'm sorry. It's my fault.
Anja, it's not your fault, not at all.
Don't say that. Don't think it.
But if we hadn't dived for so long
we wouldn't be in this position now.
Well, that's true.
It is a little bit your fault.
I'll get you a diving certificate
in about half a day.
You don't mean that.
It's private so there'll be
a small fee. Since it's just you.
-Have you seen Sven?
-Who?
-Sven.
-Yeah, down there.
-Not down there?
-No.
-With the dark girl?
-No, they're not there.
-Not again!
-What?
I'm getting a little cold.
I don't know you well, but can I say
something before we die?
Never mind. Alright, I'll say it.
When I first met you,
I thought you were an idiot.
And when I saw you again, I thought
you were so hot and sexy.
I just wanted to rip your panties off
and do it right on the beach
even though there were families
there and vendors and all that.
-Suddenly I was crazy for you, Anja.
-Yes!
-Did you feel the same way?
-Yes!
The boat!
You go. I'll stay right here.
Sven, I'm so sorry. It was really lucky
that we found you out there.
-Really lucky.
-Dyscalculus is a serious thing.
-No.
-It's a sickness.
I'm shocked it happened.
I'm very careful about safety!
I owe you a favor.
-No, you don't.
-Thursday! A free bungee jump!
-That is not necessary.
-It's the least I can do.
It is!
I'll pick you up Thursday at 6. Okay?
If you change your mind,
tell me Wednesday.
Otherwise I have to charge a
small fee. Thanks for today. Bye!
Goodbye!
Now I'm going into silence. Bye.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-How are you?
Fine, just having a beer. I do that
after a near-death experience.
-Can I join you?
-Yes, of course. That's fine.
-When are you going home?
-There's the book to do.
It's not gone well, so I'll be here
a while. And you?
On New Year's day. My friends' guys
are coming tomorrow for Christmas.
Cozy.
I'd like to ask you something,
and I'd appreciate an honest answer.
-Do you think I have a chance?
-Yes?
Perfect! The future
on a piece of paper.
Every time I get one, it comes true.
-No, really?
-Yup.
Excuse me.
What did it say?
Good. Now you know.
What did yours say?
-I have to go get some sleep.
-Is that what it said?
If I tell you, it won't come true.
New rules. You couldn't before,
but now it makes it even more likely.
-No. No.
-Please?
-Never. No.
-Come on.
-Here's my place.
-Right.
-A long way from tourists.
-As far as you can get.
-Would it be a cliché to kiss you?
-Pathetic.
We still have to ask. I'm worried.
It's weird to knock on the door
of someone you don't know.
This guy is also really shady.
Knock.
-It's your friends.
-Don't say I'm here.
-Why not?
-Just don't.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-Sorry to disturb you. Is Anja here?
-Anja? No.
-It sounded like someone was here.
-Yes, that's Gitte.
Your little sister?
I see. Well, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
Good lord.
-Good lord.
-Yes, that was gross.
We're having Christmas dinner.
Want to come?
And be with you? Okay.
-See you.
-Bye.
Oh, sorry. I have to write, bye.
No, but, listen. I don't have time.
I'm a writer and have a lot to do.
Bye. You have to go now! See you.
Are you just going to let me leave?
-Hey, darling. It's Mom.
-Yes, I can see you.
Merry Christmas! How is it?
Is it warm and awful?
No, it's wonderful. It's great.
-Have you met anyone?
-Maybe.
-No old dad!
-"Donald Duck" is starting!
-Okay, Merry Christmas!
-Bye.
Can we ride elephants tomorrow?
I've dreamed of that forever.
-With the kids?
-No, you don't bring them.
Yay! Daddy!
-Hello!
-Hi! So good to see you.
-Hi, Anja. Hi, baby.
-How are you?
Anja, we have
a little surprise for you.
Oh, wonderful.
I generally hate surprises, but...
What are you doing?
Anja, Estelle thought
that you deserve only the best.
So they brought
this little...package for you.
This is so much fun, I'm going to die.
Merry Christmas!
-What?
-I'll go buy some champagne!
-It was cool that you didn't know.
-I really didn't.
-But you didn't have a clue?
-No.
Congratulations, darling.
Merry Christmas.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
Anja, why is Fredrik here?
Aren't you on a break?
Ask your goddamned mother.
Oh, hello! Merry Christmas.
Are you sick?
Oh, sorry, I forgot. You're in silence.
I won't bother you. I've got into
a flow and will be writing all night.
So you can be silent in peace,
which is nice. See you, bye!
No, I don't want to be left in peace!
-Damn, now I have to start over.
-I'm sorry, I shouldn't have spoken.
-I want to ask about something.
-Okay, ask away.
I think that we should travel together
deep into Southeast Asia.
Really soak up the culture. Live there
and be like the natives. You'd love it.
Yes of course, but I don't think
I'm ready for that yet.
You've come so much farther
in your inner travels than I, Gitte.
Yes.
I will continue my travels tonight.
Just me. In silence.
You are so very strong, Gitte.
Goodbye.
We bought the box from
a tuktuk driver for a thousand baht.
-It's nuts.
-Don't drink the wine, Leonard!
-He's so... So cool.
-Hello.
-Hi!
-I'm Sven.
-Robert.
-Hi, I'm Magnus.
I am here for the dinner.
-Oh yeah? Nice. Welcome.
-Thank you.
So who is it that you know? Sven?
-Hello?
-What?
-You drifted away there.
-What did you say?
-Who is it you know?
-I'm a friend of Karin's boyfriend.
-Of mine?
-Yeah. Old friends.
-Who is that again?
-Fredrik, and his girlfriend Anja.
-Right. Anja's boyfriend Fredrik?
-Exactly.
-And you're here for dinner?
-No, thanks. I just ate.
-Bye.
-Nice! Thai champagne.
Sven! Where are you going?
-Home. Why?
-I didn't know he was coming.
-I didn't know he existed.
-We were on break.
-Thanks for letting me fill your break.
-Is that Norwegian girl your sister?
You know what?
This doesn't feel all that great
so I suggest we just give it up.
-Okay. Merry Christmas.
-Merry fucking Christmas yourself.
-What's with you?
-What do you think?
-Sven?
-Of course I will go with you.
-But you weren't ready.
-No. But I am now.
Sven. Oh, I'm so happy.
Do you know where
we are now, Sven?
We're at the heart of Eastern culture.
-This is the life, isn't it?
-Yes, lovely.
Sven, you have to try it,
you'll love it.
-I'm a bit scared of getting sick.
-No, you'll feel great.
You have to try it.
Sven! Sven! Sven!
Gitte, Gitte, Gitte...
Sven, stay completely still.
Sven, you're supposed to cry
like a baby. Come on.
-I'll get the tickets.
-Yeah.
-Sven Becker.
-Druve Lundelius.
Hey, buddy. We got here yesterday.
Are you living here in the village?
We took a little day trip here.
We're staying at Bang Tong Royal.
Nice to get away. 150 centimeters of
snow outside the office when we left.
-The office?
-I do life insurance.
Insurance?
What are you talking about?
-Come. We'll go see the chickens.
-Okay. Bye.
What happened to cutting the cords?
I realized you have to dare
to live the life you really want.
-Which was traveling...
-It can be, but not for me.
I was reckless and roaming.
You said it yourself at the funeral.
"I have one advantage, I'm alive."
Intelligently spoken.
You have to value what you have.
So what are you doing? Sven?
Sven? Sven Becker?
Sven, I've got two tickets to Masai
and I spoke to a guy
who will smuggle us into Burma.
I've already gone too far.
I'm far beyond where I should be.
Maybe I should just go back.
Yeah. Maybe you should do that.
Is that okay?
Yes.
To be completely honest, Sven.
It's no fun to travel with you.
You are a little old.
-And Western.
-Yes.
Keep being daring, Sven!
-Hello.
-Hello.
I think you're a bit ungrateful, Anja,
and this isn't just about Fredrik.
It's about us as well.
We put in a lot of effort for this.
That's nice, but it's
not what I wanted.
You don't want anything.
I thought you needed a little push.
I wanted a break from Fredrik,
why can't I get that?
-Do you need both of us in your life?
-No, it's because I know people.
I can tell it's not easy being
without a husband or kid.
-While we have these great things.
-Say "kids" again and I'll jump.
You're too self-centered for kids.
It's great having kids
to forget your own problems.
Stop it, you two.
This is bad enough as it is.
What a comment from someone who
can't have kids and won't admit it.
I did get pregnant. That's when I
knew I didn't want to be with Fredrik.
I'm sorry, Anja.
Isn't this cozy? Okay everyone,
let's have the highs and lows of 2011.
-Karin, you start.
-Okay.
The worst was Sonja's chickenpox
when we didn't have a sitter.
That was such a difficult period.
I didn't sleep for two weeks.
Hey...
The best was
when we finished the kitchen.
That was such
an unbelievably liberating feeling.
And you, Magnus?
It's going to sound boring, but I have
the exact same high and low.
Oh, yes, that's fine!
- Fredrik, you then.
Wow, yeah. My low was...
Well, I think you know my low.
When I didn't get that promised
promotion, that was no fun.
Of course, it was even worse
when Anja broke up with me.
And the high was
meeting you here in Thailand.
-Anja?
-My low was the breakup.
And your high?
It was...
It was when I met Sven.
Excuse me.
Sven?
Excuse me. Wait, wait...
Listen, Sven. Anja's boyfriend
is here and it's sensitive.
-You don't want to ruin things, right?
-Actually, I kind of do.
Who is that with Estelle?
Oh, that's Sven Becker,
one of my old friends.
Anyway, she's gone.
Probably to look for you.
-Are you Sven?
-Yes. Why?
-Have you been hitting on my girl?
-Never you mind.
-I mind what I want!
-What the hell are you doing?
-Fredrik!
-What is your problem?
-Come on.
-Come on yourself.
Do something!
Let him go. I said, let him go!
I've trained shoot fighting
for 19 years
and I've waited for exactly this
situation. Now it's up to you.
Take it easy, man. Take it easy.
-Are you okay?
-Shit, thanks for your help.
I didn't know you were a fighter.
I'm not. I've never
hit anyone in my whole life.
That was really hard.
-What were you fighting about?
-Anja.
-Where is she?
-I don't know.
-Go. Look for her.
-Are you okay?
-Just go.
-Thanks, George.
Good luck!
The buses are here now.
Are you thinking about him?
There's actually a reason why
we've been so negative about him.
Really?
You know, he's been
sleeping with his little sister.
No he hasn't.
He's been sleeping with me.
I'm ready to change the world now.
Thanks.
That took forever.
You don't really remind me of my dad.
You remind me more of my brother.
-You have a brother?
-Yeah...his name is Sven.
-You have a brother named Sven?
-I do now.
-Good luck.
-And to you. Thanks for everything.
Take care. And remember...
-Safety?
-Before everything else.
What is it?
Viktor? Hi, nice to see you,
I'm Jean-Luc.
-Nice to meet you.
-Have a seat.
Brancamontes. Are you from Spain?
No, from Täby. Actually, Vallentuna,
right on the border of Täby Kyrkby.
-But it sounds Spanish.
-No, it's a pseudonym.
Since I thought Sven Becker
sounded a bit boring.
It does. I think you
should go with Viktor.
Let me say it's really
great of you to meet with me
even if you think the book is bad,
I want the professional opinion.
I love it.
Right from page one I felt myself
drawn in and started crying.
-And that's very rare.
-Really?
Who hasn't felt the need
to disappear? I have.
I think it was genius
to use the rock climbing
as a metaphor for
human inconquerability.
It actually wasn't a metaphor.
And using the sea as a symbol
for loneliness and vulnerability.
And then the boat as the savior
that he hesitates to get on...
-It's absolutely fantastic.
-Yes, right.
But that bit
where they're on the beach
and are kissing and those little
lanterns...that's a bit sappy.
-A bit, yeah.
-But...I think it works.
With the broader audience,
which is really important.
I can change that part if you...
-Hello. Sorry I'm late.
-No problem.
-Anja, my partner.
-Colleague and part owner.
-Anja read your book in one sitting.
-Much of it resonated with me.
But I was wondering about
one character, this Tanja.
At the end
she goes back to her husband.
Yes, Frederico the scientist,
that's great stuff.
-I don't get it, why did she do that?
-She chose the security over love.
-That doesn't fit her character.
-It fits 100 per cent, it's fantastic.
-Can you get me a wine?
-Sure. Red, white?
Yes, please.
-What did you think of it?
-I thought it was good.
It comes through that you wrote
about what you find important.
About this Viktor,
if he's so in love with Tanja...
Why doesn't he fight?
He doesn't know
how she feels about him.
But he has to know.
Otherwise he isn't especially smart.
No, I know, Viktor is an idiot.
I wouldn't have handled it that way.
I'd have done it differently.
-What would you have done?
-I'd have gone up to her, of course.
I'd have gotten up, gone to her
and made her understand
I was absolutely in love with her.
-But Viktor didn't dare?
-Viktor is a fucking twerp.
Maybe the book needs a bit more
romance in some ways.
Something like that, maybe.
-Cheers.
-Cheers!
Sven! Buddy! What a bungalow.
You live here?
Hey, George.
Great to see you in Sweden.
I'm here now. You'll see more of me.
I sold the shop to Gang.
He took over all of it. I've met Åsa.
-Hi, I'm Åsa.
-I'm Sven. Welcome!
-Åsa is from Särna.
-In Dalarna.
Yes, that's correct.
We're moving to Dalarna
to run an adventure company.
We'll do waterfall jumps as corporate
events. 93 meters straight down.
-Good lord!
-Tell him, Åsa.
-George will design a parachute.
-Yeah, like a backward parachute.
-You should be the first to test it.
-No thanks.
-That's a promise from me.
-No, thank you.
It is!
We have a little surprise for
you here. - Hi, Anja!
And this is Åsa.
This is for you two!
You'll be mad if I
don't kiss you now, right?
Don't think you'll have time to.
Oh, that's so pretty.
What the hell is this?
Is that supposed to happen?
Yeah, that's supposed to happen.
-Good job, George.
-Isn't it nice?
I've got it under control,
it's supposed to do that.
