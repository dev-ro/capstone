Mumbai, It is said that people
spend their entire lifetime...
...to get their lives
from Slow to Fast track...
...but little did I
know that in two...
...and a half hours my life
will take a complete turn
...and shift from a
slow track to fast track.
I had 70 rupees and now I have
two and a half crores in my pocket.
I missed the last local
train and it changed my destiny.
They saying 'whatever happens
for the best' is really true.
I am glad I missed my last train.
'21/2 hours
- 21/2 Crores! Wow!
I appreciate this turn of destiny.
The 1.40 train is the last local.
It will halt at all the station.
The train on platform number one
is the last train at 1.40 to Kalyan.
It will halt at all the station.
You are not allowed to sit here.
But I missed my train
So?
So should I bring it back for you?
No. No.
- Don't stutter.
By the time you finish saying...
...what you have to; you
will miss the next one too.
I'll take the next one.
This was the last, the next
one Is Come back in the morning.
Only after two and a half hours.
Hey! Can't u tell
someone's asleep below?
Move. Get out. You too.
Don't spread filth.
This is a platform.
Come on leave the platform.
Get out! Don't mess the place.
People complain about
their days going bad...
...here my night
has turned miserable.
Friends and cigarettes,
both should be filtered.
If my friends hadn't
forced me to have a beer...
...I wouldn't be here.
You will get late.
Why you worried? Relax!
Rs. 70 won't be enough for a cab,
can't wait at the platform.
Listen Saajan let's not go today.
The city is on a red alert besides
its Saturday, it's inauspicious.
Let's go back. I assure you that
the payment will be made.
Saturday is a very
inauspicious day.
Yes, you were born
on a Saturday too.
Moron! Don't u remember Panva
came under a train on Saturday?
Even Deepak cut his finger on
Saturday and even Aslam Kharcha...
And now its your turn
to die on a Saturday.
You idiot!
Finally! Hey, will
you go to Vikhroli?
Will you take go to Vikhroli?
Driver. Driver.
Driver. Will you
take me to Vikhroli?
Very smart! On hearing a
woman he wakes up at once.
We are on strike madam.
Strike? But autos were working
in the evening? Weren't they?
The bomb blast took
place in the evening itself...
...and the driver in
whose auto the bomb blasted...
...his own family was arrested.
It's so unfair. We are guinea pigs.
Go ahead find another auto.
Ok. Ok. I didn't have them
arrested, come on lets go now.
Brother. I said no.
Find someone else.
You both want to go to Vikhroli,
share an auto together.
Middle class girls
and their attitude.
They see a decent guy
and start acting pricy.
I've got nothing to lose but she
surely is losing out on good company.
I knew she would come.
My charm is like a tube light.
Although late it works.
I am sorry.
Ya tell me. You told the
police about the location?
I told you not to!
Shut up! Just shut up!
If something happens
I will hold you responsible.
Ok. Understood. Stupid woman.
This is Bajaj speaking.
I was coming to BKC...
...but my wife informed the police
about the location by mistake.
No. No, don. I am not
trying to be over smart.
She made a mistake.
Please suggest another place.
Where? Vashi jetty?
All right. I will be there.
it's almost 2.00
I can be there in an hour.
I am carrying the bag.
Yes. It's for you. Ok. Thank you.
This is a great moment.
There is a faint intoxication.
A beautiful girl is my companion.
We have made each other.
Destiny has given you a chance.
You will regret if you miss it.
Who knows what
will happen tomorrow.
Who knows what will...
...happen tomorrow.
Who knows what will...
...happen tomorrow.
Who knows what
will happen tomorrow.
There is no auto in sight.
Look there's a taxi.
Come under the umbrella,
or you'll get wet.
Bombay rains!
Love is in the air and I
have beautiful company too.
What else do you need!
It's been ages since
I spoke to a girl...
...and even my night shift is
full of boys at the call centre.
Come on Nilesh, make
most of this opportunity.
It's 2:10 already? Meeting
with boss ended very late.
High post. High responsibilities.
Are you coming back from work too?
No, had been to a friend's
engagement party, got delayed there.
And they dropped me here.
I thought the last
train was at 1:45.
But it was at 1:40.
She smiled. Come on strike Nilesh.
If you don't mind,
can I know your name?
Name?
Your good name?
Madhu!
Nice name. I am Nilesh.
My friends call me Neil.
Hey Neelya!
I work at New York Max.
It's an MNC's call centre.
Call centre?
They collect payments
but in a foreign accent.
Mr. Donald. Your July bill is
pending. Please pay a. s.a. p.
In between I bring
in some Hindi too.
You idiot, if you didn't have
the money, why did u spend so much?
Nothing, sir. Just few words
of appreciation. That's all.
Hey! Bunty Babli!
Get out of the way.
That was close.
How will we reach
vashi jetty so soon?
Why this last
minute location change?
But... ok.
That guy was a complete hottie.
Why did you abuse him?
You've always been this way.
All you ever do is get angry.
Maybe it's because of tobacco.
Eat some bubblegum. Doctors say its
cleans your system. Do you want it?
Don't chew my brains! The
location has been changed...
...its Vashi jetty now,
another corner of Mumbai city.
We have on hour and the
city is on red alert too.
Never mind. Next time when I
step out, will buy gum for you.
Let's focus on work now.
Must be drinking and driving idiots!
Rich spoilt brats
flaunting their father's money.
In Delhi, I used to bring
these fools back on track.
Would enter their home and
beat the hell out of them.
Did u check the car number?
Let's go.
- Yes.
That's why Delhi is Delhi.
Not like this city. 1:40 is
your last local, 4:10 next local.
And look at the
condition of the roads...
...and they want to
convert Mumbai into Shanghai.
I don't understand. Vikhroli is 10
minutes from here by train and...
...you have to wait for 2 and a
half hours for the next one!
Why stop trains in the first place?
But they need time to
repair and maintenance too.
Then reduce the frequency.
But who cares.
Mumbai Dogs. Oh, no!
If they were from Delhi, you'd
enter the lane and beat them right!
It's raw and adulterated.
I take this path everyday.
Office is close by...
...taxi stand is around the corner.
We'll find a way out.
Do you have matches?
Wanted to spark off something.
Aunt will do.
You were left behind.
You should have called me.
They are druggies!
One blow and they'll crumble.
I had to control myself...
...because you are
around or else two chop...
...and
- you understand chops right?
You mean mutton piece?
No, not mutton piece. In karate,
a slap is known as a chop.
I've learnt it for 6 months at
Prakash karate coaching, Ghatkopar.
The moment you feel
angry... yeah yeah yeah.
You twisted it.
Are you making fun of me?
Yes
Auto!
Stop him.
- Thank God.
At least he stopped.
But he's entering the bar.
Make an attempt. Who knows,
he might be ready to go.
But?
But what? Once he goes in,
he wont come out.
Ok.
And listen, tell him
we'll pay him extra and...
...also say that you
have a woman with you.
Ok.
Look there.
Nana Patekar's duplicate?
I am the original. The guy on
the big screen is the duplicate.
He snatched it all away from me.
My destiny. My world.
What do you want?
Will you take us to Vikhroli?
Will you feel bad if I refuse?
Err... yaa
Let it be.
But I have a woman with me.
Who told you to loiter
around with a woman at this hour?
No autos. No trains.
Unpredictable rains.
Vikhroli isn't that close that
you can hop, skip, and jump.
Listen to me. Spend the night here.
One mosquito can turn
a man into a eunuch.
Not a bad idea.
We could kill two and a
half hours at the bar...
...catch the ext
local and head back...
...and I am in the
mood for some beer too.
What happened?
Let's go?
He didn't agree?
Never mind, there are
strange people around.
We are stuck. Don't worry. There's
an auto stand ahead. Let's try there.
Come under the
umbrella or you'll get wet.
No buses. No trains and Vikhroli
isn't close either to hop there.
I mean, we can't walk.
Then?
Well, if it's ok...
We could go to the bar.
In the bar? Are you crazy?
If I roam in the rain for 2
hours I could become crazy for sure...
What will I tell aunty
if I return in the morning?
Where am I returning from?
Aunty?
I am a PG. I am a paying guest.
Go a little later. Say your
friends had asked you to stay over.
And if you have any problem
then my house is in Vikhroli.
If it's ok with you then
you could come to my house...
...and freshen up and I
make some great coffee.
You must come and experience a
Delhi resident's hospitality.
We can be here on the road too.
She's thinking; but
if she decides to come
But I don't want to
cause you any inconvenience.
Inconvenience is inevitable.
You are very heavy. Will have
to carry you on my shoulders.
Shall we go in?
Come.
Never thought that
punishment would turn into pleasure.
Thank god Mumbai
didn't turn into Shanghai.
Step carefully and you
might end up getting married.
Or else you will stay
lonely in your house.
Eh! Why did we take a u-turn?
Brother Saajan. Tell me. Sonu.
Location has changed
From BKC to vashi jetty.
It's a trap laid by the police.
Brother Saajan, if we go
there we might be arrested.
Look police!
Where?
- Right in front.
Inspector is going to
shoot us, duck down.
Stupid coward!
Laugh all you want,
but if the cops spot us...
...we'll be flashed
in tomorrow's paper.
You will be shot in the abdomen.
Then you won't be able to laugh.
Talk now. Come on talk.
What did you do Saajan?
Killed your own man?
I missed the speed breakers.
Now look at what you've done.
I didn't see the potholes.
The trigger got pressed.
He is alive.
My ear
My ear
He was bugging us and
you pierced his ear.
Don't cry. Find it,
the doctor will fix it.
Will the doctor fix it?
Yes, Earlobes and shoe
soles are somewhat similar.
Cobbler fixes soles
and doctor fixes ears.
Help me find it.
Help him.
Look to your left. Isn't it there?
It's a peanut shell.
It looked like your ear.
Don't joke. Help me find it.
Look at the glass behind.
Hey! Hold it. Will
get dirty if it falls.
If you look into my
eyes you will go crazy.
If you look into my
eyes you will go crazy.
You love has cast its magic.
You love has cast its magic.
I have become crazy.
Because of your magical touch.
I have become crazy.
If you look into my
eyes you will go crazy.
You'll sit on my head or what?
Beer. beer
Exact. It's for 70 and I have
only 70 rupees in my pocket.
Today's my lucky day, even if I wish
for Katrina Kaif, she'd be there.
One... what about her?
Will you have something?
No. Thank you.
Get me a beer and you'd have
something to munch with it right?
Alright, 1 cold drink for me too.
Oh no
One cold drink for me.
One beer and one cold drink.
Which beer do you have?
Kingfisher. Foster. 5000. 10,000.
Do you have Mona Lisa?
There's no such beer.
I have it daily.
You don't get it in
the entire country.
Do you go abroad to have it?
Do you have it or no?
Then cancel my beer.
Just a cold drink?
Yes. We'll order later.
Now you can go.
Listen. I have money.
If it's because of money...
It's not about the money but
there is nothing like Mona Lisa.
I didn't want it that bad anyway.
How do I explain! That my wish
to have beer remains a wish.
It's all about taste.
My youth is restless.
Soothe it with your love.
The emotion has become dead.
The intoxication is increasing.
Damn! He came inside too
and he's staring at my woman.
Soothe it with your love.
I will become crazy.
Madhu! Come sit here.
Why?
Its hot that side.
Better.
You didn't get my AC.
...It's too hot here.
I will sit there.
Would you like to order?
Bathroom?
I'd like a bedroom.
Go carefully, the
bathroom is wet. It's shaky.
Soothe it with your love.
Wassup? Chaman Charlie.
My youth is restless.
Soothe it with your love.
If you look into my
eyes you will go crazy.
What will you have sir?
Give me a 36 size underwear. Moron!
What else will I come to a
bar for besides drinking!
Make an imported large,
haven't had one in ages.
God has gifted me with
a handsome face and...
...a glass of beer will
surely give it a glow.
Hmm. Should I ask Madhu for money?
I can give it to her
when she comes home! Wow!
Great idea. She will
have to come to my house.
Two birds with one arrow.
Wine and women both!
Good deal.
If you look into my
eyes you will go crazy.
If you look into my
eyes you will go crazy.
You will become crazy.
Duck. What is he doing here?
Madhu. Do you have...
What is this guy doing here?
Patrik.
C'mon, give me a hug.
You here?
What are you doing here?
Missed my last local train,
so came here to kill time.
Got a girlfriend or no?
Or still single.
Oh! Your girlfriend?
No buddy! She also missed her
last train. Madhu this is Patrick.
Pat. - Hi.
- Hello.
We've lived
together for a long time.
8 months.
We've shared it all like
buddies including our underwear.
We were very close.
And where's your glass?
He only drinks Mona Lisa
and its not available here.
What? You still are
playing that trick!
Madhu give us 2 minutes.
Pat! You've cleaned up good.
Yea! I've done well. See my Rolex
watch, my lancer, flat in Chembur.
All this in one year?
I am settled now. Tell me
if you every need anything.
One large more.
Pat you recall you owe
me Rs. 1500 because...
...you hadn't paid your
rent before you left.
Stop thinking small,
think big. Size matters.
There's a game going
on inside. Teen Patti.
Card game. Would you like to come?
I'll put the first 10,000
You are a genius at Teen Patti!
But Pat, how will I?
C'mon man!
Opportunity knocks only once.
In one night you can
change your destiny.
He's calling me.
Today's my lucky day.
Are you coming?
Forget it. Just return my Rs.
1500. That's enough.
Damn. You always talk small.
Alright, take it when you leave
and if you feel like it join me.
Hey waiter, look after him
well and make the bill in my name.
Ok. Bye.
He changed in one year.
What did I get?
An increment of 2500.
My life is moving slowly
while others sped ahead.
I have to dress up for my beloved.
For my beloved.
Feeling better?
Don't mess with me.
It's already 2:40
...we have to reach Vashi in
half an hour. How will we make it?
Call bhai and tell
him we are not coming.
They are in the lap of luxury...
...and are making us
run around the place.
Do you know what no means to them?
Am a woman; will be spared but you!
Mangesh Chilke will get you good!
Strange places the
city has doesn't it?
Like this one?
No like my call centre.
Should I ask for another cold drink?
'Take care of this gentleman.
I will pay the bill. ' - Sure.
One cold drink and one beer.
But we don't have Mona Lisa.
Get whatever you have and no
cold drink for madam. Get a juice.
Your friend seems
to be a wealthy man.
What rubbish! It's all black
money earned by wrong means.
I'd be rolling in crores
if I'd do whatever he did.
And he was offering me
10,000 for a gambling game inside.
I refused.
Very good. This is not a
stable source of income...
...and no one can be
happy with a load of guilt.
She's so sweet and innocent...
...and you are thinking of
fooling around with her.
You can order something if you want.
There is something on your shirt!
Where?
Towards the left?
Be careful. These
stains don't go easily.
So sweet. Mom has been
pressurizing for marriage.
Does my destiny
want me to marry her?
Now no excuses. Go to work.
- No.
My buttons are also loose.
What a night this is! Missed
the train, got myself a wife...
...met Patrick, and got some free
beer and then Patrick's offer.
He's right, opportunity doesn't
knock twice! Should I take it up?
If I win I will be
rich and if I loose...
...Patrick will have
to pay the money.
But she'll feel bad
about me gambling.
What will she think!
But am tempted too.
You are tempted to play cards right?
No. err...
There's nothing wrong with it.
Everyone does it, if
you want to, go ahead.
Ok. If you're ok,
then let's go play.
Listen, first you go and check,
if everything's fine then call me.
But how can I leave you alone?
Don't worry, I will be fine.
I will order another juice.
Best of luck.
- Sure.
Yes.
- Thank you.
Can't you see? Do you
want to crash into my car?
Money.
- Where is my child?
We will return him. We don't
want to raise him to be a goon.
Show us the money.
Money. We send a bag.
It's in it.
You open the bag of money while
we open the bag with the child.
You have put him in a bag.
We can't keep him loose
because he is a spoil brat.
He was showing attitude as...
...if he wasn't kidnapped but
he was on a picnic. Puppy.
Don't abuse him.
He has called him a puppy. A
child of a dog. He didn't abuse him.
Take your child.
- Come to papa.
Father, ice-cream.
Sure. I'll get you one Sonu.
Superb! We share the same name.
Let's shake hands.
Hurry up, I am in pain.
Here, keep this.
Now, let me drive.
He was more worried
about his car than his son.
Sorry dad. It won't
happen again. Ha, ha!
You bloody rascals!
Hey! Duck down! He's got a gun.
My ear.
Let's see what
cards I have this time.
Pack up.
Pat.
- Nilesh, you have come.
Come sit.
You look tensed
Ya. Just lost one lakh.
You have no money on you? I
ordered beer and juice outside!
Damn! You always think small...
...I have enough to pay for that.
Think big. Size matters.
Come again
Alright
Haha
I think I have seen him somewhere.
Who is this fathead?
Sachin Malhotra. He was
on TV the other night.
Cop's were taking him to court.
He's a big bookie.
Look, that's Karan Johar.
Karan Johar?
Can't there be more than one
Karan Johar in this world?
He owns 12 petrol pumps.
50% petrol. 50% kerosene.
And the guy next to him is Bhaskar,
a college principal.
Preaches in the day time telling
children how gambling is a vice...
...but at nigh he is
gambling away at Ponappa's place.
And you see that guy on the sofa
there, cockeyed, he is Bhujang.
He is Ponappa special man.
Who is this Ponappa?
You don't know Ponappa?
He is Aiyappa big devotee and
leader of the Shetty's in Mumbai.
He is a hunter. He does 2 things.
Prayer and murder.
He was eight years old when
he committed his first murder.
Since then he has killed 45
people according to the police.
According to him he has killed 56.
Come on get up.
Midget?
Sssssh. If anyone heard, you'd b
chopped down to the same size.
Poanna, this is Nilesh my friend.
He is a genius at cards.
If he plays on my
behalf would it be alright?
Yes
Come on let's go.
Rules of the game
And if anyone breaks the rules
Some walnut anyone?
Come on begin the game
Give the pack to the new boy.
Will you just keep shuffling?
Or play the game?
I haven't even started yet
Get everyone a drink from my side.
And make it large for this new boy.
Ten
Ten? That's it? The first
one must be atleast 100.
Eh! Neelya. Poanna said 10k.
Oh! 11000!
What is this Pat!
He is new to the game.
Hey! You can't be less than 10k.
O Duck!
10 more
1, 4, 7, 8.
10 lakh
15 lakh
Nilesh, 15 Lakh.
1, 4, 7, 8.
- Sometimes while walking around.
Someone steals our heart.
In a moment it feels...
15 Lakh.
...as if the destiny
has become bright.
Damn! Lost 25 laks.
I haven't shown my cards yet
Hey! Rao all drinks on me
and make it large for Ponappa
Hey! What are you talking?
Poanna is fasting today.
No cigarettes. No drinks. No girls.
But he gambles during his fast?
Never mind. He is new. Let's begin.
The desires are young.
The world is before you.
Make use of your brain.
Don't get too greedy.
Get out of this place or
else you might lose everything.
Great.
What! Pat! Your friend
seems to be your lucky charm.
1, 4, 7, 8.
These cards make you wonder
when you would win the game.
Begin the game, don't think.
23 lakhs in one night!
And I earn few thousands
slogging for an entire month.
If I hadn't missed my last local...
...I wouldn't be here
and winning all this.
All this is a dream. If it goes well
I might win 2-2.5 crore from here.
Free money, free beer,
and a woman! Oh no!
I have a friend. Can I bring her in?
Ya
Ya go.
I'll be back.
I'll get you good
Is this your shop?
Yes
I need some color paint
At this hour?
Don't you have any shame?
No!
The color will go after a shower.
Will you give me a shower?
Shut up! You are in
the wrong profession.
Should have been in a brothel!
I went there. But I
met your mother there.
She said to come when she retires.
Have you been to a whore house ever?
Shut up! The whole world
knows that I am a virgin.
Don't worry, at the rate you
are Going, you will remain one.
Did you see that
girl who was with me?
Waiter. - Yes, sir. - Did you see
the girl who was with me? - No, sir.
45 lakhs! What say Ponappa?
Did you see the girl?
Yes. - Where is he? - Inside.
You were with her too.
Not before at that time. Now.
I don't know
My car and house, altogether?
Still left with a Rolex watch.
Did you see the
girl who was with me?
My parents said
don't eye another woman.
Where is that guy who was with you?
First get us a beer.
Let's show the cards.
Principal. Your turn.
Play.
Let's show the cards.
Show your cards. Show it.
Here you go.
Ponappa.
You lucky S.O. B! 3 queens!
Today was my lucky day.
Ponappa you need to
have 3 aces to win.
You lost 1 lakh Patrick
You owe me money!
Sorry.
How dare you touch her?
Sorry.
- Nilesh.
Come you bastard.
Nilesh
Madhu. Come on. Let's go.
You murdered him?
I didn't. He was trying to
rape her! It was an accident...
...and he hit his
head against the sink.
He is dead!
You killed Topya?
Raghu. Rock. He is running
away after killing Topya!
Hit him on the face. Hit him.
I don't know how...
...it occurs in dream...
...in such a way.
I feel the shade of
your drape on my face.
The dream cast a
magic like a comet.
I don't know what
will happen tomorrow.
I don't know what
will happen tomorrow.
I don't know what
will happen tomorrow.
Leave me alone...
...Don't beat me. I am innocent!
Leave me. Leave me.
Where are you?
Mother Mary. Why
did I take the risk?
Nilesh. One minute.
I said one minute.
Who is he?
Who is he?
Does anyone want tea?
Duck. A tea-vendor.
Brother Bhujang. Beat
me but with respect.
Don't let any Tom,
Dick or Harry whack me.
Wait.
Bhujang don't you trust me?
I didn't bring him here.
He is not from our field. I swear.
He is very inauspicious.
I didn't kill him. He slipped.
Who do you work for?
Max York.
Who runs this place?
Mr. Aiyer is the CEO in
India and Mr. Donald in America.
Is it a foreign gang?
It's not a gang, it's a call centre.
He is an innocent
boy and not one of us.
He just wanted to save the
girl from getting raped.
Rape? Of this whore?
You are misunderstanding. She
also missed her last train...
...and she is a simple and
innocent respectable girl.
She is a prostitute.
She traps passengers
traveling in the last local.
Wherever they have to go, she
says she has to go there too.
Driver, will you
take me to Vikhroli?
Driver, will you
take me to Vikhroli?
But I am innocent. This
broke fellow was wasting my time.
Topya was calling me and I
said I'll come in some time.
He wanted to take me home for free.
Had to send him off and then I
went with Topya to the ladies loo.
We hadn't started doing a thing...
...and he entered and hit him
on the head with a bottle.
She is lying.
Yes. He did it. And I
got trapped because of him.
Sir, she is lying.
Sir, she is lying.
Sorry.
Give me the medicine
Sorry. I made a mistake.
- Mistake.
Have never seen Ponappa cry?
He cried like a child over
his brother's dead body.
Younger brother.
Of all people, you
found Ponappa brother?
Ponappa's brother.
Told you not to get
involved with women.
But you never listened
to your elder brother.
The guy is conscious
Didn't know he was your brother
Not my brother he was my son.
He hasn't committed just
one murder in his life.
He must have slept with over
400 women; but never raped any.
...and you killed
such an innocent guy.
Why are you surprised?
You bastard!
Police has come.
Who is this rascal?
It's me Malvankar.
To control the crime on this
earth and destroy demons like you...
...God has sent me Malvankar.
Had sent a packet with Tavde?
Didn't you share it?
He shares everything
with sir excluding his wife.
This is the only bar open in
Mumbai! Where is the rent?
What are you looking at?
Stop this habit.
Relax Naidu. Don't
do a Rajnikant now.
I need 50 now
That's a lot. Next time if we
are wrong will pay 1 crores.
You can't bargain with him.
He doesn't spare anyone.
Consider some
Give us some discount
If I make a mistake...
- You have made one.
There's no point arguing.
He said it once. That's it.
Give these dogs a 50
and ask them to get out.
Did you call me a dog?
Bastard!
I allowed you to work and
you're screwing me over!
Now see how these dogs bite you.
Naidu take action
and seal the place...
You'll be finished.
...and who is this girl in here?
She is a prostitute sir.
Have you opened a
whore house in here?
Come on get her in the car and
who is this boy all tied up?
He hasn't paid up his dues yet.
So you've opened up a
remand room in here?
Ponappa planning to
take law in your hands?
Sir there is a
dead body in the room.
What the hell is going on here?
And get that knife of his neck
Hey! He is mine. Dare you touch him?
Don't argue with me.
Inspector, you will be killed.
Don't threaten me. I
will beat you up...
...pretty badly.
Inspector!
You fool.
Arrest them all.
Arrest them all. Don't spare anyone.
Mumbai police saved me; they
are as good as Scotland Yard!
Here's one lakh.
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Put them in the van.
- Yes sir. Let's go.
Topya is dead?
How?
Ponappa is fasting for lord
Aiyappa so he cannot kill anyone.
You should deal with Ponappa.
Yes, so?
Last month you killed
Jugnu in Khandala, didn't you?
Jugnu was a ruffian.
Will give you 3 lakh
Where the hell are you going?
Behave, she is a woman
I know
What should we do with her?
I lakh for her
What did I do? He hit Topya.
Let me go
Women are responsible
for crimes and children
I'll pay you 5 lakh including her.
Make this pat witness
I'll sign wherever you ask me to.
But Pat
Request, I need Rs. 500 notes.
In bundles of 100 notes.
Sir I didn't kill.
It was an accident.
She is lying.
My name is Mala.
- Ask her. I am saying the truth
We are an hour away from Khandala.
There will be no population beyond.
Do you want live
quietly for a hour or...
...die talking
nonsense in ten minutes.
Sir give me a chance. I
killed 4 men in Chennai last year.
Only gents, no ladies!
You are still a fresher.
First learn from him.
He's getting to aggressive.
He doesn't understand.
Till then you junior me senior.
You are having old monk!
I live next door and I have some
Red Label whisky to offer you too
Lost the house in 3
Patti game with Ponappa
I will remove some costly items
for you until you have a glassful.
Whatever I have left?
Slow down a bit. We are quiet near.
There in this lane to the left.
Right here. You can take a left here
Not there. To the left.
Oh! Attitude! All
because I am requesting you.
Don't think I am poor.
I have contacts with DCP Mowgli;
you just watch what I do next
Wait and watch. Mowgli
will deal with you harshly.
Oh no!
Sir, the lady is crying.
He's getting it and you're crying
Is he your private customer?
I need to go to the loo.
Within half an hour
you will be free forever.
Come on go.
One of you accompany her.
Yes sir. Madam, shall we?
You're an officer you sit
Let's go.
This is very bad sir.
You can do it here.
Don't look.
- What if you run away?
Stop you bitch
She is escaping
Catch her! She has escaped!
You go!
- Yes sir. - She has escaped.
Hey stop!
- Go on! - Sorry sir!
You didn't take me seriously.
She gave you a clean sweep.
Sir, where are you going?
Just look at him.
I told you to stop
you didn't listen.
The girl said you
stopped and she tricked you.
Come on let me see your face and
how you are feeling at this time.
No birth, no death,
the spirit is immortal...
...the body is the
cloak and it's destroyed.
And if you talk too much,
I'll do the same to you.
Bloody hell!
Rascal! You are sitting here!
Tavde, she's here! She's trapped!
Hold this. - Tavde. - You
run too fast, don't you?
Tavde, let me go. I'm sorry.
You've made me run.
I'll teach you a lesson.
Tavde, what are you doing?
You are still too childish!
Tavde, don't!
- You've made me run too hard.
Tavde, let me go.
Tavde!
- Let you go!
Tavde, let me go!
Naidu!
- He will not save you!
Mr. Naidu!
Get off! Mr. Naidu!
Mr. Rajani, help me!
Mr. Rajnikant help me!
Tavde!
Madam, your drape!
Nilesh, listen to me, please.
Get lost you whore! I have had
enough because of you already.
Stop following me!
Sorry I was really scared.
I couldn't think of anything
at that time, please forgive me.
I told you to go your
own way and leave me alone.
Switch it off at once or
you'll get me caught as well.
I was scared the same way too.
I rescued you and I got trapped
and instead of being grateful
You were trying to get me trapped...
...and save yourself in the process?
Give me a minute it's a
customer on the phone.
To hell with your customer.
You idiot you broke my phone.
Shut up you fool, you'll
get me caught you whore!
You're the whore and
what about the fact...
...that you wanted to
sleep with me for free?
Stay in your limits!
Yes, I am a whore and...
...the men in this society
have given me this title.
I am illiterate
and when I tried to...
...work hard people still
wanted to sleep with me for free.
I have an old
mother to feed at home.
If you were in my place...
...you would have become
a porter, wouldn't you?
My body is all I have, it's
my strength and my skill...
...tell me what would I do?
Where would I go?
Have you ever thought...
Sleeping with prisoners,
diseased men...
...and all this because I
have to earn a living.
If a woman sleeps to earn a
living she becomes a whore...
...and if a man sleeps
for his pleasure he's not?
And you broke my mobile too!
Now don't cry, I'll
get you a new one.
Sorry I shouldn't have
raised my hand on you.
Hey listen I am going to Vikhroli,
will you come with me?
Tavde! You rascal! Come on!
The voice was coming
from this direction...
...but I can't see anything.
Now wake up the
Rajnikant in you and find her.
Shut up you rascal!
Then find her on your own.
- Tavde, you talk too much!
She's too smart! She's not here.
Let's go! - Tavde, is
she behind this tree?
She's waiting for you to show up!
Let's go!
- Come on!
Eh! Are you crazy? You bit me!
Are you angry?
They do the same
thing in Foreign movies!
You are out of your mind!
Once a whore always a whore.
Listen.
I don't want your handkerchief.
Can I offer you mine?
Let me handle this. She
was trying to trick you.
Let me take her in an encounter.
Tell me how much
Bhujang is paying for me?
I'll give you more
than that right now.
Give it to me whatever
that is you're giving.
You got one lakh for a dead body...
...I'll pay you 2 lakhs for a
living one, what do you say?
She's talking nonsense. If I lie,
you will shoot me eventually.
What do you say we go to...
...Sai-Siddhi chawl in Dharavi,
it's a little walk inside.
It's a late night
show going on in here.
Who is it at this time?
It's the police.
Don't make so much noise...
...the public is getting
disturbed in their sleep.
Hey, come on!
Who the hell is at
the door at this time?
Habiba, it's me.
- What is it Mala?
Habiba!
- What?
Have you brought the customers?
Oh my god! You've got
the cops with you. Why?
I'm in trouble.
- What happened?
I am in trouble.
Topya is dead! That
calls for a celebration.
That rascal, used to sleep with women
for free, wonder who killed him.
I did.
Just some sweets won't be enough.
We need two lakh rupees as well.
Ponappa has paid them
one lakh to kill me...
...and I have told them...
...that I'll give them two
lakh rupees to let me go.
We want it right now in cash.
You idiot! Did I ask
you to open your mouth?
She seems to be talking too much.
So, are you giving us the money?
Habiba, I'll repay you every penny.
Don't say a word. You are my child.
Check how much we have in there.
You are turning me on!
Wait, I'll switch on
the air conditioner.
'Cold winds, dark clouds. '
Wait.
Nobody's going to pay for you.
Ask Malvankar for his forgiveness.
Ask for his forgiveness.
Sir, please don't kill me.
Sir, please!
I'll do as you say.
Sir please don't kill me, ill
be grateful to you all my life.
Sir, ill repay you
every month from my salary.
Sir please, let me go.
Shut up you rascal!
Gratitude is less
valuable than 3 lakh rupees.
I will pay you. I will pay you the
amount you want. I will surely pay.
Please let me go.
You are free to go.
Sir, Ponappa will be
unhappy with what you are doing.
Shhh.
6 lakh rupees this very moment.
You can buy a scooter
with installments not life.
Habiba!
Habiba, sir I mean madam, please
give me 6 lakhs to save my life.
Habiba madam I'll repay every penny.
How will you do it?
She will sell her body
to earn every penny.
What do you have to sell?
I will repay your money.
- Get away!
You've loosened my sari.
Ba, can you come here for a minute?
If you want me to take his side,
then I am not a part of this.
I have been watching
you since you came here.
Habiba, he hasn't killed Topya.
Then? - He's losing his
life all because of me.
Pay for him as well,
I'll repay everything.
See I told you once that's it...
Then there's no need
to pay for me as well.
What was the outcome of the meeting?
Ba, all we have is Rs.
56,000 in here.
Hey! You fools!
You wasted our time...
...put them both back in the car.
Don't touch my girl or else...
A lot can be done
without touching too
Forget it sir. You want
two lakhs, I'll pay you and...
...if all goes well I'll
pay you 6 lakhs for the boy.
Come to Kurla with me
and you'll earn 8 lakhs.
You mean 2 lakhs for the boy
and 6 for the girl, total 8?
What do you say?
Eh! Can you take me
to a hospital first?
The pain is getting unbearable.
It's already 3:15! If we
don't take the money...
...to Poanna till 4 we
are in deep trouble.
Hey Saajan! He's lost his ear...
...I don't think he
can hear anything.
Yes, so?
Let's divide the money amongst
the two of us and will say...
...that Kanti took
it all and escaped...
...we'll shoot him
and leave him to die!
You bloody rascals! Stop the car.
Hey he can still hear with on ear.
Are you going to kill someone?
You're going to run into somebody.
He's going to kill somebody.
He'll remember it well.
You have the bottle, don't you?
Yes. - Get ready!
Give me the flowers.
Hey look ahead,
it's the same red car.
Did you bang into someone?
I told you he will.
He has hit and run away.
He should be punished.
Looks like a woman.
No it's a man.
It's a woman.
You don't know what you
are saying, it's a man.
It's a man.
- I think it's a woman.
Now say whether
it's a man or a woman?
Excuse me!
Murder! Murder! Murder!
Please let me go... don't
kill me... please let me go!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me. I beg of you.
Don't kill me. Let me go.
On one condition, do
you have a painkiller?
Comb flam,
Aspirin, Disprin anything?
No I don't...
...if I had one I would have
consumed it myself for my ear!
Why should we spare you then?
You don't have a tablet?
I've got one.
Have you had something to eat?
Then its fine, otherwise
consuming a table on empty stomach...
...can make you dizzy.
Are you feeling better?
No? Have one more.
Come on let's go.
Come on hurry.
I am coming. Why are you shouting?
Where did he come from?
Looks like he's calling the cops
let me kill him once and for all.
Leave him.
- Rafiq, we'll be trapped.
I said let him go.
- Let me kill him or...
...else we'll get trapped.
I will not spare him.
I want to go to Parel. You
know the way, don't you?
You have to take a U-turn.
Have you seen Parel?
Enough! Don't say it to me.
Sir was posted there.
Where are you taking us?
- I'll tell you later first get in.
All right. No,
doors! It's wonderful!
It looks like flying machine.
Can I drive your car?
No.
We've not yet received your money.
Sir can still kill you.
What are you laughing about? I
am trying to get the deal done.
For 6 lakhs?
And I can repay it
myself and I don't need you.
So, should I say no?
Sir, let's go.
There are cops behind us.
They must have told the cops...
...I told you we
should have killed them.
You'll get killed and
take me with you as well.
Apply some henna on your hands.
Decorate the palanquin.
Apply some henna on your hands.
Decorate the palanquin.
Apply some henna on your hands.
Decorate the palanquin.
Eat some bubblegum.
Give one to sir as well.
We don't need him to shut
his mouth, you need this more.
You are very sweet.
The jeep is all packed. They
have a lady inspector as well.
She looks pretty furious.
Drive faster!
Sir, my brother Lakshman
has worked in this movie...
' Dilwale dulhaniye le jayenge'
Really? - Yes, he was the
driver of the train that...
...Amrish puri and
Kajol travel to India in.
He works for the railway.
- We all saw him.
Sir have you seen
the film Ram Balram.
Dharmendra and Amitabh starrer?
Dharmendra...
Do you know who was in the bag?
- Tavde's uncle!
We all have seen him!
Don't irritate me! Look back.
They are getting close. What
have you thought about them?
Why you slowing down the car?
Come on speed up!
The city is on red alert. If I speed
up, the cops will come behind us.
Are you going to get
me arrested as well?
I am like a daughter to you.
Don't chew my brains.
Pick up the gun.
Meaning?
So how are you planning to divide...
8 lakhs amongst the 3 of you?
Four for you and two to each?
What's the point of counting the
chickens before they have hatched?
Who the hell was that?
All of you.
Get the car out.
You rascals!
Stop stop!
Hey what are you up to you have
got us to Mangesh Chilke's place.
So? - Last month itself sir

I'll get the money. Come on Mala,

Wait.
- But sir Chilke?
I don't have this gun for nothing...
...if he talks too much I'll

Come on. Sit down.
Don't trouble yourself.
What is it?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
Don't show off.
How are you?
- Take this
I have higher card.
Hey Jitya! Tell brother I am here.
Go tell brother. Come back soon.
Go on. He is with me.
I didn't want to kill him.
Its work, it happens.
He was a good man.
I couldn't sleep for two
nights after I killed him.
He's calling you all inside.
I'll just come back.
No police.
'You are foreigner. You can't
be my companion for too long. '
Come my darling, my Habiba.
How are you my sweetheart
You smell the same.
Like you have not
bathed since years.
Good.
He's a passionate man,
my Mangesh bhai.
Wont you offer us
something to drink?
Come on, listen.
Listen to this couplet.
I have a lot of bottles
of liquor in this gathering.
Take whatever you want. It's all
yours. It you don't want liquor
Then come and drink my blood.
Did you see?
Who's this?
This Mala is my child
and this boy...
...you wont believe me if
I tell you what he did.
He's the one who killed Topya.
Come here. Come here.
Come here! Come here!
He's just like a teddy bear!
How did you kill Topya?
Mangesh bhai will
you give us 8 lakhs?
All you have to do is ask...
...whether it's 8 lakhs or
8 crores it's all yours.
Thank you Mangesh bhai.
Jitya is sitting
outside; he will give it to you.
Habiba you bitch! You
forgot your promise.
You told me you will get me
something special for the night.
Where is my gift?
Mangesh bhai!
The Lord has made us eunuchs
but he has given us intelligence.
We do what we say. And I have done
what I had promised. I've brought it.
Mangesh bhai, of course here she is.
She's totally fresh and a virgin.
What are you saying?
Really! I have got
her especially for you.
Someone wisely said...
...the world is run by the woman...
...she runs the entire show.
She can get you into trouble and
then she rescues you right back.
Long live women!
You can keep her for as
long as you like. Let's go.
Thanks.
Habiba, where are you off to?
Vikhroli... err... home?
Hey come on! What are you
going to do at home. Wait here.
Me? Why me?
Wont you be here and
entertain Mangesh bhai?
He's totally fresh and a virgin.
A virgin? - I have paid 6 lakhs for
you. Be grateful and lie down here.
Habiba, me... me...
Don't hesitate. I know
Mangesh bhai's tastes.
You will be here for a month.
Live like a king and do all
he says and enjoy yourself.
Hey Habiba, he's a fresher in
this don't make him nervous.
It's between two men now.
Habiba please don't!
Come on stop your love story here.
Let's get out.
Let's go.
You wait here.
Habiba!
Come on.
Mangesh bhai?
- What? - Don't.
Hey, where are you going?
Come on stop.
Don't go away from me, let's play.
Hey! Don't be shy. Wait.
Now you are in the right position.
You like it? Hang on,
I'll be back in a minute.
He has agreed to 8 lakhs.
Where is the hero?
He has gone to play the heroine.
He is warming up. You are so
screwed, you must have thought...
...this is how you are
going to loose your dignity.
Only God can save you.
You are allowed to be scared.
It's your first time.
You should be afraid.
A little hesitation is good.
Or else the other guy
will not respect you.
He will think this guy is a regular.
But I promise you a good time.
Who the hell is it?
Mangesh bhai?
- Yes.
What is this?
- What?
That Malvankar murdered our Jugnu.
Instead of giving him
8 lakhs shouldn't...
...I shoot him with 8
bullets in his brain?
Give it to him. Let
Habiba and the girl go.
Later you can murder the cops
and hand them over to Ponappa.
Our money will come back to us
and Ponappa will be happy too.
Wow, that's an excellent plan.
Come on leave now. You
can praise me later.
Sorry for the interval in between.
Will you have a drink?
8 lakhs.
Sir, can we leave now?
- Yes.
Let's go. Let's go.
Hey, who did this to you?
Nobody. I am the one who
killed Ponappa's 3 men.
Meaning? Did you get the money?
Obviously, 2 crores!
Is the boss inside?
But wash your face
before you go in...
...or he'll be angry
to see you this way.
Don't think too much about him,
atleast he's alive now.
Hey! Stop it!
Come on have a drink. On the rocks!
Come on sit down.
Come on. Drink it.
I know why he's offering
me a drink. No Nilesh don't.
You are thinking
about something else.
What are you looking at? What are
you thinking about? Come on tell me.
Come on tell me!
There's a beauty spot on your face.
Beauty spot?
Did you like the
design of my beauty spot?
I have many more, should I show you?
Hey lollypops count them!
1.2.3.4.5.
There's one more. Shall I show you?
Have I become too fat?
Help me get this off.
I can see it.
- Did you see it?
Yes.
- The Lord has given this it to me.
This is to save me from the
bad vibes. So how many are there?
There are totally 6. There's
one inside. Should I show you?
No.
Are you feeling shy?
Come on now let's see yours.
No. - That's cheating. You
saw mine, now it's my turn.
That's enough. Don't
touch me or else...
Or else?
Oh my god! Jackie Chan!
Prakash karate
coaching centre, Ghatkopar.
I was there for a
year and a half too.
If you had cooperated I
would've look after you well.
Now our love story is
about to get violent.
Daag, the fire!
Will he shoot me?
Will he hang me?
Don't kill me. Please don't kill me!
I had told you, we shall play.
Now how can you refuse me?
Now no intervals, no hesitation.
Hollywood style love.
You must be feeling shy,
I am a little shy too.
No. No.
Lovely.
What the hell is going on here?
Boss it's done.
You got it?
2.5 crores.
You asked me to get something
done and I didn't finish it...
...has that ever happened?
You are my child... You
have dirtied your clothes.
No problem?
Is Rafique dead?
No. He is trying to
recover from a tooth injury.
This new boy looks pretty cute.
You liked him?
You can keep him for a day or
two once I am done with him.
Now empty the bag in the suitcase
and get the hell out of here.
There are cops outside.
Is there something wrong?
You don't worry. My
boys will take care of it.
Sir, shall we go?
Leave it Naidu. You
can't handle this.
Sir, I've done it.
You have put it with your hands.
He saw it too. Come on tell sir.
Come one tell sir the truth.
You rascal!
Come on you rascal stop right there!
Rascal! Will you kill us?
Don't lay your hands on me!
So you were the one who fired at me?
Will you shoot at me?
Will you kill Malvankar?
Will you kill me?
'These people! These same people! '
I must have not dreamt about
this in your worst nightmare!
Thank your stars that
there's no one around.
Now whatever has to happen
should get over and done with.
He killed my brother last month
and now I killed him and his men.
Now it's your turn.
Rascal!
More bullets?
Ponappa! Here!
You rascal! You backstabber!
Ponappa, what are you saying? I...
How dare you take my 2
crores and kill my men?
Poanna what are you saying I
have Worked under you for years.
What money? I am like your child.
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.
You have lived a life of dog.
But you will not die like one. I
am going to kill you but slowly...
...and softly by
torturing you step by step.
Shoot him on his hand.
You rascal Ponappa,
you'll die a pig's death.
On his leg.
You rascal!
All night I had been
running from my death...
...and now it's right
here in front of me.
I hope they don't see my face.
In exchange for our 2 and
a half crore information...
...that whore had taken a
promise from us that...
...we should rescue you from here...
You mean Madhu?
Are you crazy?
Can money ever be
bigger than someone's life?
And that too our
little brother's life.
Sorry we re not good
at keeping promises...
...and it's time for you to die.
That's it Nilesh. Pack up.
My friend's are responsible
for my death that made me sit...
...and have beer because of
which I missed my last train.
What should I call myself,
fortunate or unfortunate?
I don't know whether
luck was on my side today.
Ponappa, Bhujang, Mangesh,
police amongst all their bodies...
I missed the train, found a girl. I
lost the girl, I got my life back.
I was the only one
who was breathing and...
...then I noticed the
bag that had two...
...and a half crores
amongst the bodies.
Some one should take
care of the money.
The train on platform number
1 is a slow local to Kalyan.
Mumbai. I had heard people work
hard to come have a life of ease.
I had 70 rupees when I came here.
Now I have 2.5 crore rupees.
I missed the last
local and I got lucky.
Thank God, I missed the
last local of 1.40 am.
I have got 2.5 crore
rupees in 2.5 hours.
The train on platform number 1 is slow
local for Kalyan leaving at 4.10 am.
This train will
halt at all stations.
What is it?
Sorry.
Look at the way he
was staring at me.
Does he at all know what this is?
Two dangerous gangs, police,
encounter.
I have come out
alive from all this...
...and here I have my
two and a half crores.
2.5 crore rupees! I've earned it.
I'll have two houses.
Two kids and no job.
I will enjoy now.
Happy birthday Nilesh,
...this is like a new birth.
From zero to hero.
Open this and show me what's in it.
Yes check this luggage. Pavaskar? -
Yes sir. - Check properly. Come on.
What is in it? Move it. Check this.
- Yes sir. - Whose it this?
Come on open your bad
and show me what's in it.
What sir?
What what? There was a
bomb blast in Ghatkopar.
The city was is on a red alert.
We have got a tip-off for this
area as well, come on show me.
Nilesh you are screwed.
He is going to make you
open your bag as well.
What are you going to say...
...where did you get
all this money from?
What should I do?
Should I leave it? No.
Two and a half crores...
...that's a lot of money.
Don't be greedy.
You can work hard
and earn the money too.
Hey you! Whose bag is this?
Hey, come here! Does
this suitcase belong to you?
Not, it's not mine.
Is this yours?
No. It's his. He was
carrying it. He hit me with it.
He says, it belongs
to you. Come here.
I swear its not mine.
What happened sir?
Come ahead, a Gokhale, get him here.
No sir, this isn't mine.
Bring him here! Bring him here!
What are you looking at?
I say come here.
Catch him and bring
him here. Catch him.
There is bad luck, there is
no hope and I hadn't thought...
...that the worst is going to happen.
I had not thought I
would be so unlucky.
I lost the 21/2 crores
and injured my elbow too.
From hero to zero. I wish I
hadn't missed the 1:40 local.
If I had not dreamt so high my
dreams would not have broken.
Alas! No two houses, no cars,
no job, no women!
And the sweetest
memory of all that...
...happened was Madhu,
whatever she was, she was lovely.
Whose bag is this?
Whose bag is this?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
Sir, you threw the suitcase out?
There could have been a bomb in it.
It could also be a time-bomb.
It seems it is abandoned.
Ganya, pick it up.
It's mine.
Then come and take it.
If it is yours then take it.
- Wait.
It's mine.
- Why did you leave it here?
I forgot it here. Thank you.
What kind of a person are you?
My money, my life,
my houses, my cars...
...my jobs and my Madhu,
its all back.
Will you go to Vikhroli?
Mister, will you go to Vikhroli?
Mister, Vikhroli...
- Madam.
I knew you'd be here. I
missed the 1:40 last local...
...have a Rolex watch
and a house in chamber.
Lancer?
It's parked right here.
I have a beautiful girl with me.
We are sitting and have a laugh.
You have got a chance, if you
think too much you'll regret it.
Who cares about tomorrow? Who
knows what happens in the future?
I don't know what
will happen tomorrow.
I don't know what
will happen tomorrow.
