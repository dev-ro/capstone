Don't worry. Don't worry,
ladies and gentlemen.
That's just the Luftwaffe
giving us tonight's delivery.
But we'll keep on playing no
matter what those bastards do.
Keep your eyes open!
Over here!
As long as you abide
by the camp rules
you will be treated decently.
Break the rules
and you will be punished
in accordance
with the Geneva Convention.
As long as you are here,
you will be put to work
in the confines of the camp,
but also in local businesses
to compensate for the harshness
and suffering caused by the war.
Is that clear?
Jawohl!
"Jawohl"?
What on Earth is jawohl?
On English soil,
we say "yes, sir."
Yes, sir.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir!
Just in here.
Heil Hitler.
You're lucky.
We have Nazi discipline
in this barrack.
Appreciate how lucky you are.
Why the grin?
Because I'm so lucky.
Toe the line or lose your luck.
Keep away from those arseholes.
Or are you one of them?
If you snore...
I'll piss on you.
- Got a fag?
- Fuck off.
I haven't got any. Honest.
A paratrooper
of the Odenwald Einheit.
Now, which sort?
"A", forced into jackboots
at gunpoint?
"B", took a bit of persuading?
Or, "C", couldn't get
enough of it?
Are you a member of the NSDAP?
Hmm?
No?
What did you get this for?
I see.
We know what your sort did.
If it was up to me...
there'd be a mass grave
for you bastards out there.
Then I am happy
that it is not in your hands.
We're going to have a lot of fun
with you, Mr Trautmann.
Oi! Trautmann, get a move on!
I could help you
earn some fags, Holthaus.
Come a bit closer, guys.
My buddy in goal...
he's certain he can save
all your penalties.
Anyone who scores...
quadruples his fags!
Don't light it.
I'll be winning it back.
Over to you.
Dad, I know,
you've already told me.
Right, I'll go and sort
this out, you stay in the car.
Ready?
Ready?
Go for it.
Not bad!
Fags, please.
- Alright, Stan?
- Hey, Jack.
- How's it going?
- Can't complain.
These are for
the colonel's wife.
- Make sure she gets 'em.
- Will do, will do.
By the way, Jack, the colonel
says he'd love some cigars.
Yeah, well, they're not
that easy to get hold of now.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey. That blonde lad
in the goals
he's... he's not bad, is he?
He's not bad at all.
He's a bloody nightmare.
- Sergeant Smythe!
- Hello, Jack.
Did you manage to get hold
of any sugar?
The sugar... again?
Excuse me!
I want a go too.
Of course.
Ah, the ball!
- Have a go with me.
- Shut your cake-hole.
Please
show some respect for the lady.
Hey!
What on earth
is your daughter doing?
Stop!
Oi!
- What you doing?
- What?
Where do you think you are?
In a bloody holiday camp?
Come on, we're leaving.
Can't leave you alone for
a bleeding second, can I? Hey?
You know you've cost me
a load of sugar.
The camp's our bread and butter.
We've got a good thing
going here, Margaret.
Then don't drag me out
here in the first place.
Bloody women.
You're just like your mother.
And you! Trautmann.
If you wanna go back to
shovelling shit
you keep this up.
Give me that fucking ball!
Move! Go on!
Move!
Back to work!
Let's get a move on, come on.
Move! Come on!
What's going on?
Someone's trying to escape!
Right, get a move on!
Get dressed,
get your arses out here now!
Now! Chop-chop!
Get them out here right now!
Line up! Get your arses up!
Silence!
You've surrendered.
Capitulated.
Your 1,000-year-old Reich
has ended a bit early.
So have a drink on us.
Wash the foulness
from your mouths.
Now, don't start imagining
you're going home any time soon.
First, we have to identify
the war criminals amongst you.
And then there'll be
a re-education programme
for the rest of you.
You'd better watch out.
If it was up to me, gentlemen...
I wouldn't give you the steam
off my own piss.
- Run! Square it!
- Come on, lad!
To me feet!
- Faster!
- Hit it! Hit it!
Come on, Alf, you dozy bugger!
Shape up!
Fuck off!
You go in goal then!
I might as well. You couldn't
catch a bloody cold, you.
If we go down, Jack, I don't
think I can keep backing you.
Oh, don't give up on us yet,
Mr Roberts.
Don't worry,
it's not as bad as it looks.
Come on, Alf!
Looks bad enough
from where I'm standing.
Margaret!
See that then?
Bloody hell, I'd have stopped
that with me handbag.
D'you want me to take over
for you, Alf?
Get stuffed!
- Go play with your dolls!
- Oh, leave him alone, will ya?
He's got a cob on as it is.
Alfie was playing at Boyle's
wedding yesterday.
Aye, but he didn't get
his hangover playing trumpet.
Ryan!
Have you got your boots
on the wrong feet?
- Yes!
- Come on!
Your Bill is only showing off
to impress ya.
If you'd just flex your wrist
for him now and again
he'd leave my Alf alone.
That is, of course, if you
haven't already
done the dirty deed?
Betsy.
You'll be the first to know.
Oh, you puddin'!
Come on, hit the bloody thing!
Ta, Dad.
Night, night, love.
Have a good time.
Margaret! Make sure the lads
are out of there
for ten o'clock, will you?
I want 'em nice and lively
in the morning.
Dad, I'm not their nanny.
Tell 'em yourself.
Oi, oi, Jack!
- Good day.
- It was.
What about them sheep then?
- What about 'em?
- 30 quid.
Are these them
with the golden fleece?
Oh, come on, Jack.
I know you're sitting
on the bones of your arse.
I'm doing you a favour.
Look, that's worth 35 quid
of anyone's money.
35 quid, Thornton?
I'll do 20 and that's doing
you a favour.
I tell you what I'll do, Jack.
If that bunch of clowns that you
call a team win tomorrow
I'll do the sheep for 20.
But if they don't, it's 40.
Forty?

Arsehole.
Give us a minute, lads, will ya?
Sorry, boys. Yeah, I won't
be long. Just give me a minute.
Excuse me! Sorry.
Don't wanna spoil
anybody's night
but my lads need
to get home, now.
I've only just got here, Jack!
Yeah, well, save yourself
for next week, eh?
We've got a big match tomorrow,
a really important match.
If we lose this,
we're gonna be in trouble.
Give us a break, Jack!
I hope you're gonna come
and support us, everybody
but for now, lads
get home and get
a good night's kip. Bill!
Come on, you're the captain.
Take an example, get 'em out.
Think I have to go.
- I don't believe this...
- It's a big game, love, sorry.
Right, lads, come on! Let's go!
Big game tomorrow!
Alfie, come on.
Nobody gives
a rat's arse whether
you play the trumpet or not.
- Get yourself home.
- Oi!
The trumpet is the leading voice
in the orchestra!
Yeah, Jack. Gig here to finish.
Kiss my arse.
I'll kick your arse in a minute,
you stump!
I do this every Friday night.
I know you do it every
Friday evening, Alfie
because every Saturday
you've got an head full
- of cotton wool!
- Sorry.
For once in your life, think of
somebody else, will you?
- And get the fuck home.
- Er, what?
- Lads, we're waiting to play!
- Dad!
- Play the bloody music!
- Get yourself home or else.
Or you'll what? Today's today,
tomorrow's tomorrow.
- Yeah? Got it?
- Turn the music on!
Dad.
Dad, you're making a show
of yourself, come on!
What are you doing?
You can't just do that!
Was hoping you'd do it
for me but obviously
it was too much to ask.
What is wrong with you?
You're so embarrassing!
Come on!
You bugger.
Stan.
- Jack?
- Any chance I can have a word
with the colonel?
I don't know what agreement
you came to with the colonel
but if this had been up to me
you would not have
got permission.
Well, just let me have him
for a few days.
By the time I'm finished with
him, he'll be crawling back here
on his hands and knees.
Trautmann!
Come here.
You lot carry on! Come on!
Alright, you lot, back to work!
Right, shall we?
Now, whatever you do,
don't let him leave
the shop unless he's under
your supervision.
- Understood.
- And bring him back
before sunset.
Come on!
Look, I'm not your mate.
To me and everyone round here,
you're still the enemy.
You just do what you're told.
D'you understand?
Cos, tell you what, you fuck
about with me
and I will hang you out to dry!
Have you got that, lad?
Come on, get out.
Out! Get out!
Hey! Get that on your neck.
You play football.
Keep your gob shut.
Schtum. OK?
No.
What do you mean, no?
"What do you mean, no?"
What does "no" in England mean?
In Germany, "no" means "no."
Why should I?
Why should ya?
Why should ya?
D'you know you stink?
Do you like smelling of shite?
Do you like being
on the latrine detail?
Is that what you want?
Or would you rather
play football?
It's up to you, Fritz.
It's no skin off my back.
OK.
I'll take you back
to the camp now.
Get changed.
- What we waiting for?
- He's on his way.
At last.
- Where's your Jack, Clarice?
- Isn't he in the changing room?
He's probably crapping himself.
No, he wanted to go back to camp
to fetch summat.
Nana, you're mixing things up.
No, he definitely wanted
to go back there.
Jack! We gonna
get started or what?
- Paid good money for this!
- Come on!
Hey! Hey, there he is! Dad!
- Roberts is looking for ya!
- Yeah.
Who's that he's dragging
along with him?
Taking the piss!
Y'alright, lads?
Big day today, we up for it?
Bloody car. We'll have to get
rid of that bleeding car.
Telling you, I've had nowt
but trouble with it.
Right, lads! Er...
This is Bert from Bradford.
We're gonna
try him out in goals.
What's up with Bert
from Bradford's neck?
It's a war wound.
Poor lad can hardly speak.
And also I have a light cold.
Have you gone mad?
He's a fucking German.
You're not, are ya?
Yes, I am.
Thought we said schtum!
What you playing at?
Tell you what, I'm not playing
with no bleeding Kraut.
Jack, what the fuck
is going on here?
Oh, can you keep the noise down?
Look...
It's all or nothing, now.
It's shit or bust.
We can't afford to lose
another game
so I want this Kraut
to play for us.
I've seen him play
and I'm telling you, lads
he's the best goalkeeper
that'll ever stand between
them poles.
What's that supposed to mean?
Gonna drop me
for the fucking Kraut?
Eh, we are not his Kameraden.
You don't have to be
his Kameraden.
We're just trying him out
in the goals!
No, not with me here, you don't!
- Where's your loyalty, Jack?
- Loyalty?
You talking about loyalty,
Mr Fucking Friday Night!
Hey, what we waiting for?
You wanna concede the points,
then let me know.
We're coming, Ref. We're right
behind ya, promise ya.
Right behind you.
Come on! Get on with it!
What we waiting for, Ref?
So, lads.
What's it to be?
He's a fucking German.
Oi, Ref! What bloody time
do you call this?
- Come on!
- Come on, Ref!
They haven't even got
a team out yet!
Get a bloody move on!
What's going on?
And why is my Alf not playing?
Ref, start the game!
Get on with it!
Is that Ian from Warrington?
I thought Ian had been dropped?
No, no, that's not Ian,
that's, um...
I think that...
that could be, er...
Why is he waving at me?
- No idea.
- Betsy!
Come on! We're going!
Alfie? Alf...
Alfie! Where you going?
- What's going on?
- Alfie!
- I am going to kill Dad.
- Why?
Well...
never mind.
Come on, spread out!
Tackle it! Come on,
get in there!
Who's the bloody goalkeeper?
Oh, no, no...
Yes!
Spread out!
Come on, lads! Same again!
You see, in England,
a German "no" means "yes".
Ja!
Jawohl!
- Your dad'll be pleased.
- Yeah, he will.
Now then, Mr Thornton.
What did we say?
Five sheep, £20.
Consider yourself fleeced.
Attention!
Right, lad. Off you go.
In Germany, you say "thank you".
Thank you? I should thank you?
D'you know you nearly got me
lynched in there?
Why didn't you keep
your gob shut for one minute?
You know, you've got
two options.
It's either football
or hard labour.
I'm doing you a favour, mate.
We should be clear.
The reason you brought me out
was to help yourself.
And if you want me again playing
then you take me out
of the camp more.
You don't want much, do ya?

Y'alright, love?
How do?
I said how do, you lot.
Drove Hitler home, did you?
Hey. You was the one that wanted
to play football with him.
I wanted to show
the arrogant tosser
what's what,
not invite him to tea.
Dad, do you have any idea how
much Bill put me on the spot?
You could've said summat to us,
we could've discussed it.
Well, I-I-I...
Don't interrupt me, Jack Friar.
You've no right making decisions
like that by yourself.
How do you think that's made us
look in front of other people?
Oh, come on, Clarice!
When was the last time
- we discussed the team?
- Well, then from right
- now we'll discuss it.
- You're not listening, Dad!
- That's not the point.
- Spur of the moment thing!
You're fibbing! You knew you
were going back to camp.
- I had to do something!
- I heard that and all.
Well, don't you chip in.
Oh, thank you very much,
everybody, all of you
for your support.
I mean, what do you lot know
about football anyway?
Hey, when was the last time
we won 3-0?
Tell me that, any of you.
This lad could save us
from relegation.
This is not about football, Dad,
and you know it.
He's a German,
you can't just ignore that.
He's a bloody Nazi.
He raised his arm
like the others
and shouted "Heil, Hitler!"
But maybe you'd have
raised yours
if it'd stop the team
getting relegated.
Margaret!
I've got some news
for you, lady!
Not only is he playing
on the team
but starting Monday, he's gonna
be working in the shop!
So how do you like them fish?
Jawohl, mein Führer!
You need to have a word
with her. She's getting too big
- for her boots, Clarice.
- Did I ever tell you, Barb
I went to Germany once? It was
all sauerkraut and sausage.
It made me fart
like a bloody brewer's horse.
Did you hear that, Dad?
You've been farting ever since!
- Give my love to Maddie and Ben.
- Thank you, I will.
Right, lad.
This is the Friary,
as I like to call it.
That's the shop, there.
This is the entrance.
You can't go past there.
You understand? Verboten.
- Is that it? Verboten?
- Verboten.
Verboten.
This is my house.
That is out of bounds.
Private, that, private.
You go in there, there's a good
chance my Clarice will see you
you'll get a frying pan
on your head. Alright?
Come on.
Over there, that used to be
the stables.
And I keep petrol and oil
and paraffin
and stuff like that in there.
You'll not be going in there
for a sly smoke, OK?
Get that into the shop.
Hello.
I am Bert. I'm helping you.
- I know that, yeah, um...
- Um...
- Your father...
- You know you're not supposed
to come through here, that's
the entrance for the customers.
So, you, as you're
not a customer
you're not supposed
to come through
the customers' door.
So, if you need to put things
down in the cellar
then you use this door here.
We said not in the shop.
He's got to find his way
about the place, hasn't he?
Well, now he has.
What have you said to her?
Sorry. Where's the light?
It's on the left there,
above your head.
Get stuck in, lad. Get chopping
that wood, keep yourself fit.
- Yes, sir.
- The bottom line is
I want you fit for Saturday.
Focus on the football.
That's what it's all about.
Ugh...
Thought you could put one over
on me, did ya, Jerry?
You'll have to get up earlier
than that.
- So it's true?
- What?
That your dad's letting that
fucking German work here.
I know. I know, it's terrible.
- Why, what's happened?
- Well...
Nothing yet.
But it's hard enough
just having him here.
God, you poor thing.
Be careful your dad
don't leave you alone with him.
Do you think I'm daft?
I won't, don't worry.
He's probably dying
to get in your knickers.
Betsy!
You know, Lily Gloverns has
a German working
in the shop as well.
One of the girls told me
he's always
staring goggle-eyed at her tits.
Yeah, well, I'm happy he's
mostly away from me.
I better be going, anyway.
I'll see you later at dance
lessons, alright?
- Alright then.
- And Margaret...
- Take care.
- I'll keep me distance.
We don't want his German knob
exploding here in the shop.
When you've done that,
you can chop some more wood.
Ja, ja. I do it.
Do you want to help me?
Come on.
Please help me a little.
Can't you speak?
What now?
No, you cannot speak,
or no, you cannot not speak?
Are you not permitted
to talk to me?
So... you don't want
a present from me?
I see. So, when you shake
your head
it means you do want
a present from me.
Good. If you really want one,
then I'll make you one.
No, I don't want one!
Shh! Shh, you aren't allowed
to talk to me.
Barbara, you need
to leave for school now.
I said now!
Margaret, I'm not
some kind of monster.
Well, there's some folk round
here might say different.
Hating me is an easy way.
An easy way?
What are you talking about?
You think you just come in,
play some football
and everything's forgiven
and forgotten?
Forgiven that you lot
killed my friends?
Forgotten that you robbed
us of our youth?
You know, instead
of going out dancing
we had to spend our evenings
in a bomb shelter.
Hoping our houses are
still standing
and our family
and friends still alive
when we get home.
It's easy for me dad
to just see you as a footballer
because it's convenient for him.
But not for me.
I know what you really are.
I'd rather have danced with you
than stood on the battlefield.
But I didn't have a choice.
Wow!
Always look up.
Not on the floor.
Very small steps.
They were hiding from me.
Thank you.
Little bit more.
- Please?
- Yes.
Come on! I've gotta get you back
- to the camp.
- Dad, look at me!
Yeah, very good, love. Yeah.
Margie! Get out here!
Look what I can do!
Bert made 'em for me!
Come on, get ready!
Hey, Bill! Bert made 'em for me.
You never make me anything.
- Barbara!
- Hey, Margaret, that's nice.
Yeah...
Have a fag.
Have a fag, Bert,
forget half you owe.
Thank you.
What's all this, Thornton?
That's your sheep, Jack.
What? I want the carcasses!
What we supposed
to do with this lot?
Whatever you like, then, Jack.
Far as I'm concerned,
debt's paid in full.
This is not what we
agreed, you know that.
You can't just leave it
like this!
See ya, Jack!
Trautmann!
- Trautmann!
- Very sorry, I have to...
Oh, wait, no, no!
Don't open the door.
I'll get you for this, Thornton!
Trautmann!
Let me take care of it.
Trautmann!
Hey! Come on! Come here!
Stop them sheep!
I see you're really taking
good care of it there.
Trautmann!
Trautmann?
Trautmann!
Trautmann!
Didn't you hear me shouting?
I'm nervous.
Holthaus, don't miss your cue.
SOLDIER, IN GERMAN:
It's that swine Smythe.
Now, I know you're all
very excited to be here.
Very excited to watch
your, um...
- What is it?
- Comedy.
But before this, I've decided
to show you a little film
as part of the re-education
programme.
Right.
You now see
some of the people directly
responsible for these crimes.
A glimpse,
yet a sight that is too much...
for the human soul to bear.
But who is really responsible?
You, who permitted
your Führer...
to commit these terrible crimes
against humanity.
You, who failed
to take action...
to stop these atrocities.
You, who knew
about these camps...
Trautmann!
Trautmann!
Play with us.
Sure.
What?
You took the kid's ball?
You'll get it back!
Listen...
Fetch the ball and run away.
I'll count to ten.
Be gone by then
or the ball's mine.
He doesn't understand.
Right then. One...
two...
three...
See? He understands.
Eight...
nine...
What's up, Holthaus?
You used to enjoy this stuff.
You Nazi swine, Becker!
I'll kill you!
I'll string you up, Holthaus!
You'll pay for this!
Holthaus, you'll pay for this!
- Nana just made some lemonade.
- Thank you.
Presley.
Tsk, tsk!
Do you not like lemonade?
What is it with boys
and football?
Mindlessly kicking
a ball about all day.
What is it with dancing?
Well, dancing, it's easy.
It's like...
I'm floating.
When you get it just right,
there's no more gravity.
Well, I mean, not that my body's
actually floating, but...
more...
summat inside.
Like you're dreaming,
but without having to wake up.
It is the moment.
There's no before,
no afterwards.
When I'm playing football,
there's only the moment.
It's the same as dancing.
Yes.
You know, football is also
just a kind of dancing.
No, it's not,
it's bloody barbaric.
No.
Not if you look closely.
Football is like
a wonderful dance.
Margaret!
Margaret. Come on, love,
we're late.
Bert.
Fraternising with the enemy,
are we, Margaret?
Come on,
you haven't even changed.
What? Oh.
Oh, is it that late already?
Sorry.
I'll only say this once.
Margaret's my girl.
So if you don't want me
to punch your lights out
keep your hands
to yourself, yeah?
Come on, love!
- To the wing!
- Bert!
Bert! Bert!
Go on, get on with it!
Bert!
- What is this?
- Quit dancing about
ya nancy!
Jokers.
Hey, he's got some moves, him!
What's he doing?
What?
Now you have what you want!
You wanted us all dead!
Are you satisfied now?
Shut up, now!
You killed him!
You're no better than them!
Shut up!
You killed him!
What the fuck are you
on about, Trautmann?
Holthaus was strung up
by those bastards!
Oh, right, yes.
- Those bastards.
- He wasn't like them.
Have you ever asked yourself...
what Holthaus actually did?
In the war?
Now, get him away from me.
Get him out of my country.
The lot of them.
Alright, thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Gordon Bennett,
I don't believe this!
They're sending
the prisoners home
the week before
the relegation decider!
What am I gonna do?
Well, that's it.
He didn't even say goodbye.
Couldn't they wait another week?
How can they do this to me?
How can they be so selfish?
- Hi, Betsy!
- Hi, Barbara!
Margaret!
You won't believe
what's just happened.
- What?
- I just heard from Fred Brywick
the Lancashire camp's
getting closed!
Isn't that smashing, eh?
Isn't that wonderful?
You know, I mean,
it's a scandal.
All these criminals
are being set free.
But you're finally
rid of your Hun.
Eh? And Alf's back in goal!
What do you say to that?
Betsy, get lost.
What?
Out.
I want you out of the shop,
this minute.
Bye!
Bert!
You never left after all!
I gave your father
my word to help
the team and I keep my words.
But we didn't know
if you were lying.
Margie, Margie!
- Bert's back!
- Hmm?
Bert's back!
What?
Dad!
Mum, Dad! Bert's back!
Oh...
I, uh, I made up the bed
in Barbara's room for you.
Now, it's quite small, but...
I think it'll be cosy enough
for you for a week.
I'm sure it will be. Thank you.
You can stay
as long as you like.
But, um, I suppose
you'll be looking forward
to going back
to Bremen next week?
Oh! Coming through,
coming through!
Flippin' hot, these.
Come on, Bert.
Sit yourself down then.
Bert, sit next to me.
Oh, yes.
Is your, uh...
is your Bill knocking on later?
What?
Oh. No.
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Barbara!
No. No girl at home.
Take no notice
of this lot, Bert.
We need to concentrate
on the Burscough game.
Right. Well, enjoy, everyone.
It's my speciality.
Tripe and onions.
Oh, dear. We'll all be farting
like a brass band.
Mother!
Bert.
Thank you.
This is my room, Bert.
It's very nice, Barbara.
Thank you.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Be careful with my toys.
Yeah, yeah, I don't touch them.
I didn't say you couldn't touch
them. I just said be careful.
Goodnight.
Come on, come on!
Get on the ball!
Tackle him!
Bloody hell!
I told 'em about
the number eights, eh?
They're asleep, Jack.
Bloody hell.
Jock Thomson,
what's he doing here?
Aye, it is.
We can do this!
Come on, lads! Shape up now!
- Lovely to have you here, mate.
- Ah, pleasure to be here.
If you'd have passed it to me,
I would've scored! It was clear!
Knock it off, will ya?
You're all as bad as each other.
You're making a right show
of yourself, the lot of you.
And in front
of Jock Thomson and all!
Aye, that's got your attention,
hasn't it?
Jock Thomson
from Man City's out there!
Mind you, he's probably
come to watch Hudson.
Look, Tommo!
Get over their winger
will ya? Let him know
you're there.
Bill, you've not been
in their half yet!
I mean, they're all over yous.
What's the matter with ya?
I tell you what, if it hadn't
have been for Bert
we'd have been 3-0 down already.
But having said that, Bert,
your distribution's terrible.
It's no good saving it and then
giving it back to 'em, is it?
Look, I know you're going
home tomorrow, son
but just give me
45 minutes, will ya?
Just please concentrate
on the game. Alright?
Oh, come on, lads.
It's the last game of the season
and we have to win.
Show 'em your spirit,
get out there!
Do it for the town!
Do it for the North!
Do it for England, if you like!
Do it for anybody, just get out
there, lads, and fucking do it!
Come on!
Come on! Go on!
Yes!
Foul! Get him off!
Ref!
Come on!
Yes! Yes!
Well done, Jack,
you did us proud!
I told you we'd do it,
Mr Roberts, didn't I?
- That's all.
- Proud of you, man.
Yeah.
Well done, lads. Well done.
Good man, good man.
- Great footballer, am I?
- Great, David, now really good.
Nice one.
Alright? Well done, kidder.
Alright, Bert?
Mm.
Not bad, today, son.
Not bad at all.
Yes.
What did Thomson want?
He wants me to come
to Man City for a trial.
Frank Swift wants to stop.
What do you think?
What do I think?
I think you're pulling
my plonker, Bert.
Come on, get in here.
Get some of this beer
down your neck
before this lot drink it.

It took us a week to learn that
bloody German.
Right, Bert, we got this for
you, mate, to take home.
Come here.
Can't say I'm not happy
to see you go though.
I'd like to apologise
in advance for the next song...
but these three lovely ladies to
my left have asked for it, so...
grab your partner by the hand,
it's a little slow number.
Let me introduce...
"Bad Habits."
So, how often have you...
Bill?
Margaret?
Margaret!
Sorry.
- Margaret...
- Go home.
You stay here.
Margaret's my girl.
I've told you, haven't I?
Let's settle this once
and for all.
Go on!
- Bill, what the hell...
- Shut up!
- What are we doing?
- Three penalties.
- You save two, she's yours.
- Bill...
What the hell?
- You can't play for Margaret...
- Shut the fuck up, you!
You can't make eyes
at somebody else's girl
and expect to get away with it!
You get in that penalty box
or I'll fucking smash
your face in!
It's up to you.
One penalty.
- All or nothing.
- Fine.
You didn't even try!
Bastard!
It doesn't matter how many
penalties you take, Bill.
She'll never be yours.
You fucking what?
You fucking what!
Fuck off back to Germany then!
Fucking...
You fucking Kraut!
You fucking...
you lost the fucking war,
didn't you?
You lost the war!
You fucking German bastard!
Margaret?
Bert? What you doing?
I, um, I...
I... um...
- I...
- Come on, Romeo. Get to bed.
I think I can stay
and play for Manchester.
Yeah. Course you can.
Come on, get to bed.
Goodnight, Bert.
Goodnight, Jack.
Where've you been?
I been making sure
Bert keeps his gloves on.
Oh.
Well, that worked.
Margaret?
You've got to
understand, Bert...
that the world's been crazy
in the last few years.
It's gonna be a while before
anybody can think straight.
People have got deep wounds,
you know?
Lost people and family.
On both sides, I know, y'know?
Thing is, Bert...
You're talking about
my daughter.
My little girl.
I've looked after and protected
her all her life.
She thinks she knows everything,
Margaret, eh?
She's not seen anything
of what you've seen, lad.
Thank God for that.
Look, I like you, Bert.
You're a good lad. I know that.
I've had the benefit
of getting to know ya.
A lot of people haven't
and a lot of people
wouldn't want to, neither.
You can't argue
with the bereaved.
Knowing Margaret,
she'll carry that with you.
Is that what you want for her?
No.
Good lad.
Let's go, son, eh?
Goodnight.
You know
you don't always have to do
as me dad says.
What... what you doing?
I'm training!
It's eight o'clock
Sunday morning!
And I've still got an hangover
from your wedding.
Friar, would you stop
making all that noise!
- It's him!
- Get back to bed!
I'm gonna tell Margaret
she's married
a bleeding lunatic.
Alright, son? Let's go.
I'm ready for you.
Come on.
Gentlemen, here he is
the new Manchester City
goalkeeper
Bert Trautmann.
Now, feel free
to ask him questions.
Raise your hand to do so
and we'll get you all covered.
Y'alright, Bert?
Yes?
Did you ever imagine
as a German POW
that you would end up
as Man City's goalkeeper?
No, I still cannot believe it.
What do you want
to achieve here?
I want to win the matches.
And to take good care
of our family.
Where did you
learn to play like that?
When did you find the time?
I mean, you're very young
and you were a soldier
for a long time.
In my childhood,
there was nothing
I enjoyed more
than to hear my friends
calling for me to come
and play football with them.
My father was very strict
and I couldn't leave until my
household chores were finished
but then I ran down as fast
as I could to meet the others.
But I was mostly too late
and the teams had already
been decided on, and...
and nobody really wanted
to go in goal so I went in.
Lucky for us.
Manchester has
a big Jewish community.
How do you think they'll react
to you being here?
Let's keep the questions
related to...
Our readers are going to want
to know if your Jerry
- was involved in war crimes.
- The war's over.
You can't expect us
not to ask these questions.
Gentlemen, please.
Now, we're introducing
Bert Trautmann here
as a great new talent
for Manchester City.
I did what all soldiers
had to do.
There was no choice.
I had no choice.
You say
you didn't have a choice
but we've looked into you
and we found out
you volunteered for the army.
He was a young lad.
- Yes, I did...
- Hey, come on, lads.
- Back to the football questions...
- But I didn't know
what I was doing
or what it would be like.
And when I found
myself fighting
on the front line,
it was too late.
I...
I then just did my duty
as any soldier would do.
So, you didn't
want to be a soldier?
I didn't really have that much
of a choice in the matter.
You were awarded several medals
including the Iron Cross.
Is that true?
Is it true
you have an Iron Cross?
Yes, I have.
And you're a member of the...
Right, gentlemen. We request...
No, I'm requesting...
Did you have any knowledge
of the deportation of the Jews?
This is outrageous!
You have an Iron Cross?
There are thousands who have it,
it doesn't mean anything.
And what about volunteering?
You said you didn't have a
choice and then I have to hear
that you volunteered?
I need to know the truth.
- The truth about what?
- About you!
About what's going on
in that Kraut head of yours!
You don't want to know.
But I do!
I mean, how is this marriage
supposed to work?
It has to be built on trust,
you have to trust me.
I do.
Bert! Don't walk away from me.
I need to know who I married.
Tell me the worst thing
you've ever done.
The thing you're
most ashamed of.
Can you tell me that?
Man City goalie
has an Iron Cross!
Read all about it!
Extra, extra!
Goalie was a Nazi!
I want my money back right now!
Maybe it was a mistake
to sign him.
He didn't tell us
about his Iron Cross
or any of his bloody medals.
We never asked.
Nazi!
We have to see the team.
You got us into this mess, Jock
and you'll bloody well
get us out of it.
I mean, fucking hell!
Uh... Rabbi Altmann.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Uh, please, step into my office.
Listen to them, eh?
We're up against that
and Arsenal.
Now, listen to me.
I'll tell you how
we are going to deal with this.
Every one of you
will be supporting
every other player in the team.
That's our strength. Solidarity.
You keep that in focus.
The football will take care
of itself.
Come on.
There's no war
in this dressing room.
Come on, City!
But Rabbi, if your people
boycott us,
others will follow.
Some are already giving back
their season tickets.
The gates are down.
The gates are down
just because of a boycott
of these Jews?
Well, don't get me wrong...
You should have thought
about that
before you put
a Nazi in the team.
Go back to Germany
you murdering bastard!
Kraut scum!
Dirty bloody Kraut!
If you stopped booing
for a while
maybe I could concentrate
on the game.
Thank you.
Fuck off back to Glasgow!
You bunch of losers!
Kraut go home!
- Get back to Germany!
- Fuck off!
Go fetch him
out of the rain, love.
They're destroying him, Mum.
His presence here is an insult!
We're a football
club, not a revenge club!
It's time to forgive and forget.
Forgive and forget?
Fuck off!
You're dancing
on people's graves!
Mr Thomson, Mr Thomson!
Right. May I?
Jack Friar from St Helens.
- I used to train Bert.
- Get out!
Hey!
If you wanna keep your teeth...
Come here then! Big man, you're
collaborating with them!
Hey! Hey! Excuse me!
- Excuse me!
- Come on!
My name's Margaret.
My name's Margaret Trautmann.
For what the Germans did to us
they should never be
allowed to forget it.
But that doesn't mean
that we can't forgive.
- What is this, Jock?
- I mean, are we...
Are we letting women
run the show, now?
Dry your eyes,
for Christ's sake.
If a woman, a young woman,
has the courage to turn up here
and talk to you lot,
she deserves to be heard.
Now, shut it!
On you go, love.
Bert has only learnt how to do
two things in his life
that's be a soldier
and be a footballer.
Yes, he fought
for nearly four years
he doesn't deny it.
But he wasn't alone and...
you can't hold one man
responsible
for all that happened.
What's next, "he was
only following orders"?
I understand, I do.
I understand, really.
I didn't know him as a soldier,
I only know him as a man.
If you took the time to look
past the fact he's German
you'd see he's just someone
doing his best
to put the past behind him.
You're sleeping with the enemy!
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you!
You lot band together
and try and break
a man who's already broken
instead of helping him
find a future.
And all because it's easier
than forgiveness.
You know, you're no better
than the people you accuse.
Shame on both of ya!
You disgust me!
- What?
- You disgust me, all of you!
- Come on, Margaret.
- I am proud to be the wife
of Bert Trautmann!
Come on! Gentlemen!
Come on, City!
Rabbi Altmann writes open
letter! Extra, extra!
You seen the newspaper?
Have you heard
what Rabbi Altmann wrote?
Listen to this...
"Each member
of the Jewish community
is entitled
to his own opinion...
"...Jewish community is entitled
to his own opinion
but there is no..."
"There is no concerted action
to end our support
for Manchester City..."
"The crime
of an entire nation..."
"Despite the terrible cruelties
we suffered
at the hands of the Nazis..."
"We would be no better
if we were to persecute people
who are related to
but are obviously
not connected with
any such crimes of hatred."
"If this goalkeeper is
as they say, a decent fellow
I would say there is no harm
in him playing football..."
"Each must be judged
on his own merits."
Come on! Faster!
Hey, Jock!
Yeah, go on in! Go on!
Thank God it's a lad.
- Dad...
- Grand!
Got an house full
of bloody women. Bert!
Congratulations, son.
Now you'll be part of the family
whether you like it or not.
Aye, up.
- Hold his head! Hold his head.
- He knows, he knows.
Give over, he's a goalkeeper.
- There we go.
- There you go.
That's it.
Cupholders Newcastle United
in black shorts are at home
to Manchester City
before the 61,000 crowd
at St James Park.
And that's how it stays,
a goalless draw.
Tottenham Hotspur
in white shirts...
...and missed opportunities
though of course Trautmann
and the City's other defenders
are pretty stout.
Oh, my God!
Bert Trautmann
once a German prisoner
of war in Britain
had a vitally important job
defending the City's goal.
He rose to the occasion
magnificently.
In less than ten minutes
Bobby Mitchell took
a very nice pass
and beat Trautmann
from a sharp angle.
- The crocodile!
- I can't find my crocodile!
- Where is it now?
- Rrraaargh!
Everton try again and once more
Trautmann saves the situation.
Time and again,
they threaten the goal.
Only Trautmann's heroic efforts
keep the ball out of the net.
Nice one, Bert.
Great save, Bert!
The battle was on,
and battle it was
in a sea of Flanders mud.
Perden tries a sudden shot
at goal, but Trautmann saves
and narrows...
but unrattled, they swing into
a raid of their own with Hayes.
Hayes crosses
and Clark heads it home!
The only goal of the match.
Manchester go on to win here.

Typical scenes of a vast crowd
arriving at Wembley
open the story of the Cup Final.
Here are some
of the hundred thousand or so
who pack the famous stadium,
and Newcastle...
More than 100,000 spectators.
British Rail laid on 38 specials
to bring the fans to London's
Wembley Stadium.
Her Majesty the Queen had come
with the Duke
and Princess Margaret
to watch the big match
and there was an ovation
for them, of course.

Oh, look, there's your dad!
There he is!
Fine looking
lads, heads held high
each side hoping for a positive
outcome, but as we all know
there can be only one winner,
and my money's on Man City.
Each knows what the stakes are,
and are ready to fight for it.
Go on, Trautmann!
We need you, lad!
Referee Alf Bond
has just blown the kick-off.
Roy Clarke plays it back,
ooh, too short!
Govan and Brown are immediately
on the offensive.
Murphy... Murphy,
will you make an attempt?
He takes a long shot
but straight into
Bert Trautmann's arms!
What a way to set the tone.
You need to mark him!
And it's Paul
going to take the free kick.
Out! Out!
And Man City
are now finally on the attack.
Clarke gets the ball from
the left
plays it forward to Revie
on the edge of the box.
Right heel to Hayes, he shoots!
He scores! It's a goal!
It's a goal!
This is something completely
different to last year
when Man City were trailing...
We've been going
for only three minutes
and already one team's ahead.
And Little attempts
to clear the ball...
Christ's sake!
You need to mark him!
Passes to Kinsey,
takes his chance and scores!
Goal! It's 1-1!
Man City were caught sleeping,
Birmingham equalised.
- Absolutely thrilling game.
- WHISTLE BLOWS
And that's the end
of the first half.
I doubt the Man City manager
is going to be very happy
and I would imagine that he will
have some serious words
- to say to the boys.
- I think you're right.
So, we're 20 minutes
into the second half
and Manchester
really threatening
Birmingham's goal.
That's passed... pass...
and it's a goal!
Get right back!
Trautmann kicks the ball long
over the heads of the retreating
Birmingham players!
Dyson flicks it over
to Johnstone.
Johnstone runs,
he's gonna make a break for it.
And he scores!
Goal, goal, goal!
Yes!
3-1 to Man City!
This could decide the game.
Absolutely amazing!
Just look at the grin
on Bobby Johnstone's face.
The Man City fans
go wild! Fantastic.
- Absolutely wonderful.
- A great ball by Trautmann!
What a goalkeeper!
Trautmann!
Birmingham
attacking down the left wing.
They're really pushing
the boundaries now
with only 20 minutes left
to play.
Bert, you alright?
Trautmann's down...
It looks like Murphy's knee
in Trautmann's head.
What happened to Daddy?
I don't, um... nothing,
sweetie, he's just...
he's just, um...
he's had a little...
- Need the medic!
- Stay back, lads.
- Get up, Bert.
- Alright, Bert?
Just calling the medic over now.
There seems to be a problem
with his neck.
I don't think he's getting up
from this one.
Could be a serious injury.
Will they be down to ten men?
This could allow Birmingham
back into the game.
Looks nasty. Trautmann doesn't
seem to be moving.
The crowd have gone very quiet
here in the stadium.
On your side.
Oh, what's he doing?
During that tackle,
the fifth vertebra broke in two
and lodged against the sixth.
Oh! There's
movement from Trautmann.
He's getting back on his feet...
Which then held the fragment
in pieces and saved his life.
He's moving again!
He's back on his feet!
He's there!
Bert Trautmann is back!
I don't understand,
he carried on playing?
He gives the signal
and the audience
gives him the support
he deserves!
A sudden jolt could have
killed him.
He broke his neck.
He's gonna see it through
to the end of the game
until the thing is done.
Ooh!
Ooh, he saves it again!
Oh, but he's down!
This really doesn't look good.
No, this time he's...
He's not staying down,
he's getting up again!
Oh, no! He's down!
Trautmann is down,
he's clearly in a lot of pain.
The collision was obviously more
serious than we thought.
He's getting up again!
I don't believe it!
The fans are ecstatic!
What a man!
It's all over,
Man City victorious.
The FA Cup is theirs!
The whole stadium are
on their feet!
Man City fans going wild
Birmingham City obviously
saddened by this defeat
but both sides shall be very
proud, it was a wonderful game.
Trautmann, Man of the Match!
Trautmann, The Man
Who Played On!
Trautmann is
obviously still in pain
but Her Majesty
presents the trophy to Roy Paul.
Trautmann the hero!
Victory for Man City!
Bloody hell, Bert,
you look like a teapot.
Have you seen the papers?
You're all over 'em.
Traut the Hero.
The Man Who Played On.
I'm anything but a hero.
You daft lump! You could've
bloody well killed yourself!
Mind you, she does have a point.
- Give us...
- Would you lot give over?
He needs some rest.
Mum!
Who's that, John?
It's my dad!
- And you're proud of him?
- Yes! Yes!
And look, Grandad, I've got
a ball from the Cup Finals!
Is that the ball
from the Cup Final?
Right, over here, John!
- No!
- No!
Will you just stop it?
Stop! No...
Dad!
One...
Two...
Three...
See? He does understand.
Seven...
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
What?
Hyah!
Johnny!
Why didn't you pick it up
you lazy monkey?
Hello?
Hello, love, it's me.
Oh, hi, love!
How are you holding up?
I just wanted
to hear your voice.
What are you up to?
Uh, nothing much.
Nothing special.
- Ice-cream!
- Just a bit of cleaning
what about you?
Mum, the ice-cream man!
Do you have any change?
No, you don't need an ice-cream
it's far too cold outside.
Don't be so strict.
- Mmm...
- Let him have one.
Alright.
Hey, Johnny.
- There you go.
- Thanks, Dad!
There's something
I want to tell you.
It's something about the war.
Take care, now.
Lad! Lad, you left me too much!
Hello?
Margaret?
Hello?
No! No!
My boy!
"Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day
our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us."
I'm sorry for your loss,
Trautmann.
No one should have
to go through that.
Smythe.
Sergeant Smythe.
What are you doing here?
I come here too, every day.
Just like you.
My wife and two kids...
are buried over there.
They died when your lot...
bombed Manchester.
I hear...
that you don't want
to play football anymore.
Mm-hm?
Go out there and play, Bert.
Play for the people
who've accepted you.
For those of us...
who've lost someone
in the wartime.
Play for your son.
Go out there
and give something back.
Get lost!
It's my fault, Margaret.
It's my fault.
What?
Do you think you're
the only one in pain?
How do you think I feel?
I hear an ice-cream van...
and the world falls apart.
It's not always about you.
And I'll be damned if I let
you sink into self-pity.
I've sacrificed everything
to be with you.
Everything.
You don't understand.
This is my fault.
I am paying, we are paying
for what I did in the past.
I didn't save that boy and now
my son was taken from me.
What boy...
Bert?
What boy?
In the war, this boy got shot...
and I could've stopped it
but I didn't.
I am being punished.
He were my son too.
He was my son too
and I am not...
paying...
for your sins.
So stop it. It's not about you.
We can't bring him back.
So we move on.
We move on or...
or we bury ourselves.
