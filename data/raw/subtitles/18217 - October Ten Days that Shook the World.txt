Studio MOSFILM
OCTOBER
This film
was produced in 1927
by a group
of soviet filmmakers,
led by Sergei Eisenstein
for the Tenth Anniversary
of the October Revolution.
This film recreates
the events of October 191 7
with the greatest possible realism.
Many participants of
the Revolution,
Red Guards,
soldiers and sailors
appear in the film.
Among them is
Nikolai Podvolsky,
one of the leaders
of the armed uprising.
Leningrad and its streets,
the Winter Palace,
the corridors of the Smolny,
were the same as in that
fateful year.
Thus, OCTOBER 191 7 renders
a stirring ''eyewitness''
account of the early days of
the birth of the
Soviet Union.
A masterpiece created by
one of the world's greatest
film directors,
it's a welcome
gift to film viewers.
The original film premiered
in the era of the silent screen.
This sound version was made by
Eisenstein's associate
Grigory Alexandrov.
The music is by
Dimitri Shostakovich.
