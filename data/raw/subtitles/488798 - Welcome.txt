This is human trafficking.
One of the worst forms of
modern day exploitation.
From great individuals
and their communities...
...to countrywide organizations...
...governments, and
international organizations...
...like the United Nations...
...the battle is still
being raged on many fronts.
To combat an organized crime...
...we need to be organized.
All of us who believe...
...that no human
being should be enslaved.
No child. No woman.
No human person...
...deserves this.
Let us break our silence.
Let us break our tolerance...
...to such a crime and
strengthen the hands of...
...those of us who are...
...fighting this battle.
Come, join me...
...in this global fight...
...against human trafficking.
Scream loudly!
I'll charge the fees of
the patients who run away...
...because of your
screaming from you!
Scream!
'This is Dr. Ghungroo.'
'Ln spite of owning
such a large hospital... '
'... he could not fix his own neck.'
'Yes. That's his ailment.'
'His neck turns automatically
and people misunderstand it.'
'Now look at this.'
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
I'm here to apply for the
job of your personal secretary.
I see.
Rascal!
What a strange and foolish girl!
She's not foolish but a decent girl.
Ghungroo, whenever
a girl slaps you...
...you can be sure that she
belongs to a respectable family.
Shall we go?
'Today Dr. Ghungroo is
accompanying his wife, Payal... '
'... and the pundit to select a
bride for his nephew, Rajiv.'
'He has refused more than
500 alliances till date... '
'... because he wants a very
honest and decent family.'
'And he has his own style to
judge how honest a family is.'
Whether you accept our
proposal or not is up to you...
...but I can't deceive
decent people like you.
I'm a doctor by profession but I
also carry out some illegal work.
And my nephew is the
greatest loafer of all.
Liquor, gambling, races, drugs!
Frankly, we don't deserve
such decent family like yours.
What happened! Are you shocked?
This Jodhpuri coat I am
wearing to show you how decent I am...
...was too tight around my neck
and preventing me from speaking up.
You talk of illegal work!
We are neck -deep into all
kinds of illegal activities.
There's no greater villain than me.
Well done, pundit! Wonderful!
This is nothing!
My father is behind
bars since 6 years.
Do you know that minister's son?
What is his name? Whatever it is.
We used to supply drugs to him.
Mr. Haridayal?
- You're right!
Wonderful! Great!
- He is my real father.
Mother, tell him.
Great pundit! What a business! Wow!
And as far as
licentiousness is concerned...
...my daughter is
always on page three.
Now that's interesting!
Mr. Ghungroo, the
world has changed so much...
...that if a girl doesn't
have half a dozen boyfriends...
...then she is not
considered as a hottie.
You're right! But she
doesn't look so hot.
Don't insult me like this,
uncle. You want to see? Then see!
Look at her! Isn't she hot?
Why did you slap the pundit?
Because we want a
family whose relatives...
...have never been to a police
station let alone gone to jail.
Hey.
- Wait.
'He wants such a
decent family which... '
'... has a totally clean image.'
'That's why his nephew
is still a bachelor.'
Okay! Okay, try! Try, baby!
Try, try, try!
Try, try! Make an effort!
Very nice baby! Very nice!
Sir, you are great! I was
trying since two hours...
...but you made him
do it in two minutes.
The girl he marries
would be very happy in life.
This poor guy is ready with his
bat but nobody wants to bowl to him.
There are several who
want to bowl to him but...
...his uncle, Dr.
Ghungroo, is a terrible umpire.
He keeps refusing all the
proposals that come his way.
Why are you teasing Rajiv?
Come here all of you. It's
time to cut the cake. Come on!
Come on!
- Let's go!
Rajiv, take care of my children.
- Okay.
Hey no! No, no, no!
You're holding the
rocket in a wrong way.
It might hurt him. It
might get into someone's house.
Hold it straight.
Uncle, this is my rocket.
If I hold it with an angle...
...only then it will go straight up.
Look, if you hold it straight,
it will go straight up.
All right. I will light it.
Gopi, get back!
Uncle!
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Uncle, what have you done?
Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Help Sanjana!
She is trapped in the fire!
Is someone trapped in there?
Our friend is
trapped in there! Please!
Uncle, why don't
you too go in there?
You have caused the fire!
What?
- What?
He has caused the fire?
- He caused the fire!
What, he caused the fire.
- I am going inside.
I am going.
It's been so long! Why
haven't they come out?
I think he is coming!
He is coming!
Yes. Yes.
Oh God, he has come.
Sanjana, what happened?
Poor guy! Come on, let's go!
Why is there a
smile on uncle's face?
Uncle, what happened in there?
Hey. Hey!
Fire!
Fire!
Wait!
Sorry, aunt!
I have noticed since two days that...
...you've been thinking
about that girl a lot.
You are in love!
For the first time in my life
I've felt like this about someone...
...that she is made just for me.
I close my eyes and
she appears in my mind!
I open them and I see her.
I feel like thinking
about her all the time.
Aunt, pray that I meet
her just one more time.
You'll surely meet her.
But we should pray that
her family is very decent.
Brother, everything
is clear! Come over.
'This is Sanjana's brother,
Uday Shetty.'
'He wanted to be an actor
but he became a gangster.'
'But whenever he
looks into a mirror... '
'... the actor within him awakens.'
'His only dream is to get Sanjana
married into a respectable family.'
'But why will a guy from a respectable
family marry a don's sister? '
'So, they have their own style...
...to talk about the alliance
to respectable people.'
God has given us everything.
Wealth, fame and respect.
Our status in the
city is such that...
...if we go to a house with a
proposal we won't be refused.
All we want is a decent
family and a nice groom.
But the pundit didn't tell
us about your businesses.
Didn't you tell them
about our business?
What could I tell them?
Sanjana Airways!
Oh yes! Sanjana Airlines!
Sanjana Textiles!
Yes, Sanjana Textiles.
We're into a whole
lot of businesses.
It's widespread!
We handle the
businesses only over the phone.
Boss!
Boss, there's good news for you!
Not one, but two.
You will be happy to hear that.
He has ruined everything.
Sir, there is a good news.
Your one phone call worked.
The Dhansukh murder case
which was running against you...
...has been closed.
The witness knew that if
he testified against you...
...then you would wipe
out his entire family.
That man has withdrawn
the police complaint.
He wants an out of court settlement.
He has already paid 20 million and...
...he'll pay the
remaining 30 million in court.
Come on. Hurry up.
Sir, who were those people?
Go ask them!
They had come with a
marriage proposal for Sanjana.
They didn't come! I had
called them from Mumbai!
I had made you to lie about us.
Which decent family is
left in this city that have...
...not begged before me and refused?
Sorry, sir. I was so excited...
- What do you mean by excited?
Can't you understand where
I am, who am I talking to...
...and what I am
talking about? Control!
Control!
Ballu Prasad, tell him
what happens when I get angry!
I have an artificial limb.
I was a good hockey player.
Once, when brother Uday got
angry about something I said...
...he broke my leg
with my hockey stick.
But he's good at heart. He
took me to the hospital.
He got me operated, got me a
new foot, gave me this stick...
...gave me some money and...
- Enough! That's enough!
Now tell me what
should I do about you?
I had thought if I
gave you the good news...
...you would pat me on my back.
Sir, forgive me! Sir, he'll kill me!
Sir, forgive me! Control!
This famous painting was painted
in 1995 by Sumit Chatterjee and...
...we start the bid
at 50,000 dollars.
So can I hear
51,000 dollars? Can we?
51,000 dollars! 52,000 dollars!
55,000 dollars!
Perfect! 60,000, dollars!
65! 70,000! Anybody else?
Okay, so it's going for 70,000
dollars to bidder number 13.
And now ladies and gentlemen, I
present the last painting of the day.
Oil on canvas, by Ahmed Raza.
A world-renowned artist,
as you already know.
Burning desire!
Thinking of you.
Makes my heart peaceful.
O my beloved.
Thinking of you.
Makes my heart peaceful.
O my beloved.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
You're my life, my
love and my desire.
You're my life, my
love and my desire.
O my darling.
Thinking of you.
Makes my heart peaceful.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
My lonely moments are
lost in your thoughts.
How do I tell you how much
my heart desires for you?
My lonely moments are
lost in your thoughts.
How do I tell you how much
my heart desires for you?
Thinking of you.
Makes my heart peaceful.
O my sweetheart.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
You're my life, my
love and my desire.
You're my life, my
love and my desire.
Kola Laaka Vellari.
Thinking of you.
Makes my heart peaceful.
O my beloved.
Wait!
Come out!
Mister, what's going on?
Nobody move!
Come on, get out!
Freeze! Freeze!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Nobody will make a move!
Freeze!
Mister, what is going on?
Can't you see my
boss is painting? Boss?
What kind of nonsense is
this to cause an accident...
...and make a painting out of it?
Who is this crazy boss of yours?
Okay, okay! Sorry, sorry!
Oh my god! This is my boss, Majnu!
Who is this Majnu?
He is a big don.
You're very lucky!
The day I use the
brush I don't use the gun.
Or else you were a goner!
All I wanted to say was, what
was the need to cause an accident...
...because painting is a
work of one's imagination.
That's for the bad painters.
I paint it directly as I see it.
It is also called live painting!
Last week, he was stopping
everyone on the bridge and...
...asking whether
they knew how to swim.
The one who said he did
was thrown into the water.
Boss wanted to paint
a swimming person.
Don't move! Or else you'll be dead!
If boss' painting
turns out to be bad...
...then your family
will mourn over you.
He has no family!
They too are here?
Yes. He is still unmarried!
Do you want to die as a bachelor?
This is too much! He has made
a cartoon out of decent people!
Stay there!
- I'm slipping! Sleeping?
Not sleeping! Slipping!
I'm losing my footing!
I want a full
background of this decent guy!
Lmmediately!
Boss, forgive me now! How
much faster do I have to run?
Brother Uday, I've
been calling since long...
...but you have switched
off your mobile phone.
Today I have
finished off F.M. Hussain.
What?
Brother, look over there.
Looks like the party
from India has fled.
Brother, can I ask
you something? Yes.
Is Sanjana your real sister?
- She's more than a real sister.
Of course but is she
really your real sister?
You're enquiring because I'm dark
and she is very fair, aren't you?
Shankar Shetty, my father,
married twice.
Yes, father married twice but
Sanjana hasn't even been married once.
What do you mean? She
will marry only once!
You're right. She
hasn't even married once!
But now she will.
The solution to your problem
lies in that painting of mine.
Can you see that guy?
Which guy?
The one sitting on the bonnet.
Where is the bonnet?
Under the guy!
Yes.
That guy is very decent.
These decent guys are very bad.
They have no decency.
That's why I'll
solve this matter myself.
I will get the guy's
background tomorrow.
And I will talk to his
family in my own style.
You should not get in my way.
Then only God can help us.
Ever since we opened this boutique...
...you didn't show me
its account-book even once.
I'm going to the beauty parlor.
Go on! Whenever I
take up the accounts...
...you run away to the beauty parlor.
Squander my money!
Hello!
Mr. Ghungroo, how is
your business doing?
Business is good! Very good!
I'm sitting on a hefty profit!
Won't you share your profit with us?
Send 4 boxes immediately.
This is a boutique. You get
ladies dresses here not empty boxes!
You fool! A box
means 10 million rupees!
Oh I see! 10 million?
And you want 40?
Did your parents leave it with me?
You rascal! I'll send you to hell!
Do you know whom you are talking to?
This is brother Majnu! I hope
you have heard my name before!
Of course I do. You just told me
twice that you're brother Majnu!
So what should I do?
Hey smarty, have you gone mad?
Looks like I may have to kill you!
I am asking for protection money!
Do you understand?
All right! So you want protection?
Do one thing. Get me 40 million.
I will protect you.
And if you want to get
beaten up then call again.
If I don't change your gender...
...then I'll stop
calling myself Dr. Ghungroo.
Now hang up!
He is taking me on!
Get out of here!
- The shop's closed down forever.
Stop the work here.
Hey, get out!
What are you doing?
What is happening?
What going on, brother!
How dare you threaten brother Majnu?
Remove those clothes!
And you remove those drapes!
Take it out. Fast.
Yes! Now you do look like a woman.
Black, yellow and blue!
Come on. Take him away!
Brother Majnu!
Brother Majnu, I made a mistake.
I thought someone was fooling
around with me on the phone. Really?
If I had known you were on the
phone, would I talk like that?
What did you say?
What do you mean by that?
What do you think of me?
- Brother!
Brother, you are fine.
This is my problem.
Not just you, many
have such a problem.
Moreover, your
population is ever increasing.
Listen you fool!
I am listening. Tell me brother!
I want 50 million
by tomorrow. Get it?
But brother you had said
40 million over the phone.
That was over the phone!
Now boss has himself come to you.
Who will pay the traveling charges?
Brother, 10 million
traveling charges?
All right.
All right.
Thank god, he didn't
have any snacks on his way...
...or else it would
have been 60 million.
It can be 60 million!
If you don't deliver 50
million by 5 tomorrow evening...
...your family of three
would become family of 6!
Make him understand!
How is that possible?
If each one in the family of
three is cut into two pieces...
...then how many would that make?
6! Let's go!
"No entry in the lanes of love."
"No. No. No. No. No entry."
There has been one more murder
because extortion money was not paid!
Today morning, in broad daylight,
in a busy market, in public...
...the famous builder
Shyam Agarwal was...
...gunned down by three people.
We at Kal Tak news channel were
the first to break this news to you...
...that the infamous underworld gangster
Majnu is behind this massacre!
He has committed many
murders since childhood!
Not only children
and old people but...
...he has also not
spared the handicapped!
It's surprising. People earn so much.
They should give some
to these poor chaps.
Will they take all
the money to heaven?
Who will stop Majnu? Who
will stop this devil...
Will you cause me a heart-attack?
You were going to
cause me an attack!
You shouted as if brother
Majnu had threatened you.
He did! In broad daylight! He
came to my shop and threatened me!
Brother Majnu will
surely kill me by tomorrow.
Brother Majnu!
- Yes.
Our brother Majnu?
Majnu threatened you?
He's just a kid! Just a kid!
Do you know him?
He is like a son to me, Mr.
Ghungroo! - Really? - Yes.
Really?
- Yes!
Please sit!
You should have
uttered my name once!
Instead of demanding money
he would have given you some.
No, I don't want anything from him.
And neither do I want
to give him anything.
You are so naive! Come on,
get ready and come with me!
You'll see that the moment he
sees me he'll fall at my feet!
Why do you call me Majnu?
Do you think I'm indebted to you
since you got two of my men married?
Our wives have run away! He got
us married to such girls! - Yes.
Haven't you earned a lot of
money by arranging such marriages?
You too arrange for
10 million by evening.
And you?
- Yes.
Government hospital's broken bench!
Now you will not pay me
50 but 60 million! Get it?
Continue your game.
You've again brought
me to a wrong place.
I brought you here?
You brought me here.
Because of you I have to pay extra.
You brought me here!
Even I have to pay now!
Salutation! Salutation, sir!
Salutation, sir!
Salutation, sir! Salutation, sir!
Salutation, sir!
Why is he saluting
everyone like this?
Salutation, sir!
He is following boss' orders!
He didn't salute our boss once!
Boss has given him the punishment
of saluting everyone for six months!
Salutation, sir!
This is our boss' private jail.
They are undergoing punishment here.
What was his crime?
He got fewer
balloons on boss' birthday.
He said he finds it
difficult to inflate them.
His punishment is to inflate
balloons until the next birthday.
And what will boss do to him?
And this guy is a doctor, isn't he?
Boss will open a
dispensary for him here.
Yes, where he would be the
doctor and also the patient!
He will have a knife and
scissors in his hands.
He'll say he's operating on himself!
Brother, I could not run away.
But you still have time.
Go straight to brother Uday Shetty.
He is the only person
who can solve your problem.
Really?
- Uday Shetty?
He is well known in the city.
Everybody respects him.
Even brother Majnu!
Really?
He increased 10
million in our every meeting.
And the wrong thing is he
calls it protection money.
Protection money? I have
earned this money in many years.
Please save me from
these ruffians, sir.
I am in deep trouble, sir.
Get up. Get up.
Don't worry.
Do not cry.
Brother Shetty, did you call me?
Majnu, what are you up to? You
call up anyone and ask for money!
Mr. Ghungroo is my...
- Don't give me so much respect.
Why not? Even biscuits are
called Parle-ji these days.
And you are a doctor. You do
good service to the people.
I treat the poor free of charge...
...that's why my
hospital is running a loss.
Look! He's such a great doctor.
And you? What?
Sir, I didn't know
that you knew him.
Knew him? Doctor? He is my friend.
Then he is our provider.
It was a mistake.
What is going on?
I don't understand!
Your job is done. You can leave.
Shall I hit him? I feel like it.
I will always be indebted to you.
It's not a big thing.
- Yes, it is.
No! - Sir, you're my saviour!
There's still some
decency in this world.
It was nothing! But if
you are really grateful...
...then do something for me.
Just order me. Order.
I have a younger sister.
- Yes.
She's beautiful.
- Okay.
She's of marriageable age.
Now I got it.
God has given us everything.
Wealth, fame and respect.
People respect me so much that...
...if I go with a proposal to
any house they won't refuse.
All I need is a groom.
Who is decent, honest and
belongs to a respectable family.
Who can keep my
sister happy all her life.
Mr. Shetty! We should
have met long before.
I have a nephew. Yes!
He is decent, honest...
...and belongs to a
respectable family. - Wonderful!
I may not be as rich as you
are but we are very respectable.
Pundit, we'll think of
the wedding date later.
Let me find out what he thinks.
- But you have my consent.
You give your consent?
- Yes.
Then so do I.
You have given me your word.
Don't ever go back on it.
I am a respectable person. My
word is like writings on stone.
Congratulation!
Mr. Ghungroo! Wait, please!
I want to tell you something!
What will you tell me? I
have seen it with my own eyes!
He is not human but god.
Thank god, I found you here!
Come on pundit. Come along!
It's an auspicious day.
It's a very
inauspicious day. Take my word.
Uncle, what is it? You
look very happy today.
I have fixed your
marriage into such a family...
...if you hear about it
you'll be dumbfounded.
Right, pundit!
My god! What a great
person is Mr. Shetty!
If you ask me, he's the most
decent person I've ever met.
He's not a decent man!
He's a murderer!
His day starts with
the sound of gunshots!
With the sound of gunshots, sir.
And his night is not over
until he kills a dozen or so.
What are you saying?
- I swear!
Shetty is a don!
Don!
- Yes.
O god!
O my god!
Majnu and Uday have deceived
you to get their sister married.
You don't get it...
I am sick and tired now!
I don't know what to do!
I am so unlucky! So unlucky!
Rajiv, you've broken
the steering wheel!
O God! What will happen now, uncle!
Rajiv, do something, please!
I am so unlucky!
What can I do!
Aunt, what happened?
Leave you aunt. Where is your uncle?
Uncle!
- Where is uncle?
Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle is safe! He is safe.
Uncle.
Son, stop the car!
How do I stop? The
brakes are not working!
No brakes? I'll get a heart attack!
Aunt, I'll do something about it.
We will not move! We won't move!
We won't move!
We will die but not move!
They won't move!
We won't move!
You have to move! The
brakes are not working!
Move! Move!
Get up! Run!
Get up! Run!
Get up! Run!
Nephew.
Uncle!
Son, don't stop! Go faster!
Don't stop!
Damn this steering wheel!
Aunt, hold the legs!
Hold the legs.
Not yours, but his legs!
What are you doing!
Rajiv, don't leave my hand.
Rajiv, please.
My whole family will be wiped out!
Nephew, do something.
Uncle, don't worry!
I'll do something.
Be careful, Rajiv. Be careful.
Nephew, what are you doing!
What are you doing!
I will try to stop the car!
Be careful. Be careful.
Stop the car!
Nephew.
Stop the car!
Rajiv!
Nephew!
Uncle!
Boss is here.
My lips are as
soft as rose-petals.
My beauty is as
intoxicating as wine.
My lips are as
soft as rose-petals.
My beauty is as
intoxicating as wine.
People are crazy about my style.
And are willing to die for me.
Then come on.
Then come on.
Then come on, let's
live our lives together.
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
I feel like kissing you right now.
Your lips are inviting!
Wow! What a beauty!
It has driven me crazy!
Wow!
Wonderful!
"When this drink starts brimming..."
Whoever looks loses control.
"When this drink starts brimming..."
Whoever looks loses control.
There's a talk in the town.
Your beauty is so very vicious.
My style is so unique.
It makes every heart beat faster.
Everyone is
head-over-heels about you.
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
I feel like kissing you right now.
Your lips are inviting!
Your lips are inviting!
Aunt, don't look like this.
All these people have come to
enjoy, play and sing and dance.
Like us they are not here to
plan how to get away from gangsters.
Taunt us! You too can taunt us!
If we had stayed there,
either we would be dead or...
...you would have been
forced to get married.
He didn't think before fixing the
alliance. He is thinking about it now.
He has never been a
good judge of people.
She's absolutely right!
If I were a good judge...
...would I ever get married
to her? Good judge of people!
Stop this domestic dispute! Stop it!
I am in deep trouble and here
you are fighting with each other!
Just think what
would happen to me now!
How can I? How can I think?
I just can't think in her presence.
I have to go away
and think of something.
Ok, go.
We are losing so much
money and I can't concentrate!
I know when you...
I am so sorry!
No problem.
Stupid!
Dirty old creep.
- How shameless!
Listen to me...
Ghungroo, whenever
a girl slaps you...
...you can be sure that she
belongs to a respectable family.
Damn these half-naked guys!
Rajiv!
Rajiv!
I have thought of such a good
idea that they can do no harm to us.
What?
- Yes.
I have found such a girl who
I've been searching for since years.
Thank God.
You've found a new
problem for me, haven't you?
This girl is not a problem
but a solution to your problem.
Understand? Do one thing.
Light the candle of your
love in her heart and marry her.
I will apologize to Shetty!
I'll tell him I wanted my
nephew to marry your sister...
...but what can I do?
My nephew deceived me.
He had already got
married 3 months ago.
Even if he is the
biggest don of the world...
Will he get her sister
married to an already married guy?
Just take a look! Look at this girl!
Uncle, I don't want to
look at this ugly girl!
Aunt, you know why I don't want to
get married. Why don't you tell him?
Just take a look!
- How do I explain to him?
I don't want to listen to anything.
- I don't want to...
Look at the girl! Look at the girl!
The important thing is, she
belongs to a respectable family.
Brother, if Sanjana
looks at this painting...
...you will lose her respect!
Don't worry about Sanjana.
We're here for a
change and to enjoy.
If I don't enjoy with these
girls then what's the fun!
O foreigner, don't go away.
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
What a great song, boss!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Please do not move!
Please do not move!
We've just got news that terrorists
have planted bombs in this place.
Bomb!
Bomb!
Run!
Wait! Please don't run.
For god's sake... We don't
know where the bombs are.
Maybe one is under the table!
Maybe in that ball!
And because of you there
might be a blast in here.
The bomb-squad is on the way.
Nobody will move from
his or her place.
I see your eyes
in the morning sun.
Until you catch me
in the falling rain.
Sanjana, he's the same guy!
In the fire incident.
And you come to me
on a summer dream.
He will surely get us all killed.
Stop him.
Listen.
And it's me you need to show.
- No. No.
How deep is your...
How deep is your love.
I really need to know.
Cause we're living
in a world of fools.
Stop, you idiot! Stop!
"Let me kick this..."
Saw that! We made a
fool out of you so easily.
Sorry! Sorry!
Thank you, friend.
- It's okay!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Frankfinn, the world's number
air-hostess training institute...
...is organizing
Frankfinn Smart Woman Contest.
The girl who can
fool a guy three times...
...will get 50,000
dollars on behalf of Frankfinn.
And this glittering trophy!
So what's the wait for...
Your time starts now!
Can I help you?
Hi!
Sanjana, maybe you
didn't recognize me.
Why wouldn't I? Aren't you same
guy who pulled me out of the fire?
Sanjana, now you
are embarrassing me.
In fact you had saved me. I had
fainted and you had pulled me out.
And it's no fault of mine. Anyone
will lose his senses on seeing you.
You're so beautiful!
What's the date today?
1 st April!
Are you making me an April fool?
No, no! I swear, I'm
not joking! I'm really...
...Can I help you? I'm taller.
I will help you!
- Okay!
Whenever I get close to it,
a breeze blows it away!
It's a girl's drape. It
won't come to you so easily.
Really? I will not rest
until I get this drape.
Wow! Great man! Amazing!
This is nothing.
Miss. Sanjana, it's
Draupadi's sari? Draupadi's sari?
That's enough! You're too much!
You're too sweet!
Too sweet.
You are sweet too.
Look at this! Look! Uday Shetty!
Oh my god! Your nephew
can't even entice a girl and...
...this Uday Shetty is
calling me up continuously!
I don't know what to do with him.
What else can we do but pray to god?
O god, please help me!
What kind of help is this?
Hey, where did he disappear?
Listen!
Peter! Peter! Peter!
Peter!
- Sorry!
Help!
- Hey you!
Hey, you! What are you doing!
Come here!
- Come here!
Get him!
- Hey you!
Come on. Check.
Brother Uday!
- Yes, Majnu!
Is everything all right?
Trouble up there and
trouble down below!
I can't find Ghungroo! I
searched his shop, house and hospital.
And when I call him he
doesn't take my call.
I am getting nervous.
Come back immediately!
What are you saying, brother Uday?
Who will look after Sanjana?
Don't worry about Sanjana!
Her friends are with her.
They will look after her.
You come back immediately!
I'm going to kill this Ghungroo.
Save my shoe.
Let's go. Picnic over.
Who is it?
Hey you idiot! If you want
to commit suicide then jump!
Or should I help you with it?
Are you judging the
fall by throwing the shoe?
Why are you holding it?
Throw it in the water.
Let's look somewhere else.
Sanjana, get ready! He has come.
Where is he? Where is he?
Okay! Behind me?
I hope she doesn't
make me an April fool!
No, she is blindfolded. I
will pass her by quietly.
Left, left!
Right, right!
Grab him! Catch him!
Caught you! I caught you!
O god! It's you!
Actually we were just playing.
It's alright. It's alright.
Are you mad at me?
- No, absolutely not!
It looks like you are.
- Not at all!
And why wouldn't you? We
had made a fool out of you.
It's nothing like that. I
too like to play pranks!
I can also do it. But
I didn't do it on you.
Really?
- Yes.
Then we will get along well.
- Ok.
Come on, shall we have coffee?
- Yes.
No, I won't have coffee with you.
Come, let's go, please.
You have already made a
fool out of me! I can't go!
Come on.
- I can't go.
Sanjana, where is your necklace?
What necklace?
It was around my neck!
Was it a costly one?
It was worth 25-30 lakhs.
Let's search for it.
Search it. Search it. Search there.
Must be somewhere here only.
Did you get it?
Did you find it?
Did you get it?
Why don't you search there?
- Yes. - There.
Shelly.
Sanjana, look there. Your
necklace is lying there.
It's over there! There it is.
Thank god! You found it!
I will get it.
Hey! We won!
Where did he go?
Did he drown?
I don't know.
Come on, girls.
Sanjana! What are you
searching down there?
You!
Did you lose your necklace again?
Just look at him.
Say you wanna, wanna say
wanna love. - Say what?
Say you wanna, wanna say
wanna love me baby. - Why?
Say you wanna,
wanna say wanna love.
Say you got to got to go.
Say got to got to go.
You're so tall.
You're so beautiful.
You're so tall.
You're so beautiful.
And extremely
gorgeous and dazzling.
"I die for you."
"I die for you."
Your eyes are lovely.
"I gaze at your day and night."
Your eyes are lovely.
"I gaze at your day and night."
The moon hides behind
the clouds and sobs.
The moon hides behind
the clouds and sobs.
"O dear, shower on me..."
"...the rain of your love."
"You are unique."
"I lost my heart to you."
"You are unique."
"I lost my heart to you."
"You are unique. I
lost my heart to you."
"I can't spend a day without you."
"I die for you."
"I die for you."
You're so tall.
You're so beautiful.
And extremely
gorgeous and dazzling.
"I die for you."
"I die for you."
Uncle, I'm leaving.
Rajiv! Where are you going? Do
you want to put us in trouble?
Why? What happened? Nobody should
know we are back in town. Go inside.
Uncle, I am going to
meet Sanjana's brother.
You had said I should
get introduced to him.
Oh yes! Yes, yes!
You're right. You're right.
I have also found out
from Sanjana's friends...
...that Sanjana's brother
is a big shot of the city.
Once your alliance is
fixed with his sister...
...he will deal with Majnu
and Shetty. Why should we?
Go my son. Go on. Go from there.
Bye aunt.
- Bye.
God has given us everything.
Wealth, fame and respect.
All we need is a
decent and honest groom.
My search has ended today.
I like you very much and
your family likes Sanjana.
Nothing could be happier than this.
Brother, Sanjana's birthday
is on the 13th and I think...
...we should keep the
engagement on the same day.
How can we make all
arrangements so soon?
Arrangements? All you have
to do is print some invites...
...invite some people and
order two rings. What else?
Looks like you are in
greater hurry than me.
Brother, if there is some
problem then... - No problem!
No problem, sir. No problem.
Boss, you can never
have any problems!
Not one, not two but I
have three good news for you.
I'll listen to it later. First
meet Sanjana's future fiancé. - Okay.
Greetings!
- Greetings!
Meet me before leaving! Understood?
Yes sir!
What happened, brother?
What happened? It is very strange!
During our times, parents used to
lock us in but... No, it's no problem.
Brother, I'll introduce my
family to you whenever you want.
Two days later is the opening
of my hotel. I'm giving a party.
Bring them along.
- Yes, sure. I will surely come.
Who are all these people?
They are for my security.
- Security?
Yes, security.
If someone tries to harm you then
they will... - Lay down their lives!
They used to be in the navy.
Why do you ask?
Because brother, there was a guy...
Actually there are two guys.
They are giving me a lot
of trouble. - Who are they?
They are very big people.
Tell me, I'll bring
them down to our level.
Now that we are
going to be relatives...
...your problem is my problem.
By the grace of god, nobody
can trouble us in this city.
Tell me, who are they?
It's enough for me that
you are willing to help.
Now I will myself talk to them.
Talk to them. Or else let me talk.
I'll pacify them on the phone.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Majnu, if you had
come seconds earlier...
...l'd have
introduced you to the groom.
Who was he? The one
who Sanjana loves.
I have fixed the
engagement of the 13th.
What will happen to
the guy in my painting?
Remove him from the painting
and make a building instead.
What are you saying, brother Uday?
I worked so hard to get to that
guy. Now you want me to forget him?
But that does not mean you should
marry your sister into any family.
What are you saying?
I was not able you explain to
you properly how decent he is.
Look, Sanjana loves this guy.
And his family too likes Sanjana.
I have fixed the alliance.
You should forget that guy.
Sir, I just can't
control my excitement. - Don't.
I shouldn't ask this but I
can't help it. - That is right.
I don't understand which guy you...
...are selecting and
which you are rejecting.
Come on, I'll show you.
- Sir! I am sorry, sir.
Dr. Ghungroo, the
alliance is broken.
What are you saying?
Alliance broken...
What are you saying?
You're breaking the alliance?
You disappeared after fixing the
alliance with brother Uday, didn't you?
No, I had gone to make
arrangements for the engagement...
...and the marriage.
So I was a bit late.
Too late! My sister has
fallen in love with someone else.
I say sorry on
behalf of brother Uday.
Sorry? Thank god, I got rid of...
My nephew will be shocked!
Why did you abduct
my uncle like this?
Those who don't answer our calls,
we abduct them like this.
What do you think?
- Rajiv! Rajiv!
They have brought me here to tell me
that they have broken the alliance.
Broken the alliance?
- Yes. Understand the situation.
But uncle, they could
have said it to us politely.
They could've
easily said sorry to us.
Hey! - Shut up! Let him speak!
Let him speak! He has been hurt.
Come on speak up!
Thank god you broke the alliance
or else we would have done it.
Because I love someone else and
soon I am going to get engaged.
Rajiv!
- Uncle, just a minute!
Do you know who they are?
- Who are they?
They are very rich people.
They can buy you and
what is his name? - Shetty!
Yes Mr. Shetty! They can buy out
10 guys like you very easily! Yes.
Yes!
Brother Majnu, now
do you understand?
That's why we had disappeared!
In order to plan how we can
get rid of gangsters like you.
What would the sister be like
if the brother is a gangster?
And what would
their parents be like?
I wouldn't have gone with this
alliance even if I were dead.
Brother Majnu, you
abduct anyone you like?
Remember Mr. Majnu,
someone else can abduct you too.
Hey, you're talking too much!
Nobody can even touch my boss!
Nobody can touch him?
I touched him.
If anybody touches me
you'll be in deep trouble.
Don't try to touch me!
Here, I touched him again!
What will you do now?
Rajiv! Hey, who is supporting you?
Do you want to know? Would
you like to talk to him?
Take this. Here's my phone.
Should I dial his phone number?
Would you talk to him?
Do you have guts? What happened,
why are you tongue-tied now?
Hello... Look here!
I touched him for the third time.
Rajiv! Don't touch him anymore.
You'd be inviting trouble!
Listen Mr. Majnu! If you
ever try to cross my way...
...you're going to have it
from me and my relative.
And this is my first
and last warning to you.
Let's go uncle!
I touched him again. Hey!
Looks like a
big-shot is supporting him.
But who could be above
brother Majnu and brother Uday?
It could be only one person.
George Bush! - Yes.
Welcome! How are you Mr. Mir?
Greetings, sister.
Greetings, Mr. Uday, you've
built a magnificent hotel.
It's because of your good wishes.
It's very nice of you
that you came. Really.
Boss, there are only
decent people in the party.
Only white-collared
people have been invited.
So that amongst them...
...brother Uday and
I may also look decent. Very good!
Do you think you'd look
decent just by having a shave?
Sanjana!
- Hi!
How are you?
- I am fine.
I got an invitation for
the engagement ceremony...
...but where is Rajiv and his family?
- They might be on their way.
Aunt, can you see the grandeur?
Thank god, he got
rid of Shetty's sister.
Uncle, it is a bad thing.
One shouldn't make fun
of someone's misfortune.
More than the girl, I
feel bad for the family.
They will regret it for the rest
of their lives. - That is for sure.
Hey Ghungroo.
Aren't these the same people
whose proposal we had refused?
Kapoor's are Criminals!
- Leave.
Mr. Ghungroo? What are
you doing in this party?
My nephew's marriage has
been fixed with the sister of...
...the person throwing this
party and who owns this hotel.
Greetings.
- Is that so? - Yes.
Hey Mr. Ghungroo, this is amazing!
You've found a very decent family!
Absolutely!
If you had to accept this proposal
then what was wrong with ours?
Let's go! I don't know
what they think of themselves.
What did he say? What did he mean?
Nothing uncle. Just
don't pay attention.
He's just jealous. Let's go.
Kapoor's are Criminals!
Pardon!
Brother, Rajiv's
family is here. I See
Hello! Hello brother!
Sir, this is my uncle and... Uncle,
this is my brother.
Oh No Uncle! Are you okay, uncle?
Is there a doctor here? - Ambulance!
Aunt, why isn't he
regaining consciousness?
I don't know,
Rajiv. Ghungroo! Uncle!
What...
What would I do by
regaining consciousness?
The alliance which we
wanted to get rid of...
...is hounding us.
Sanjana is the sister of
the don, Uday Shetty! - What?
Oh my God, again.
- Rajiv!
Rajiv! Rajiv!
Dear!
Please check me!
That Ghungroo is a greater
villain than Uday and Majnu.
If he could, he would
make us dance to his tune.
He had to go unconscious.
Do you know what he said when I
had gone to break the alliance?
I wouldn't have gone with this
alliance even if I were dead.
What would the sister be like
if the brother is a gangster?
And what would
their parents be like?
That's why we had disappeared?
In order to plan how we can
get rid of gangsters like you?
Didn't he run away because he
wanted to get rid of a criminal family?
I will set him free.
Vallabh, come on! Get the ready!
Come on! Brother Uday! - Let me go!
Brother Uday!
- Let me go!
Hey Don't forget, it's the
matter of our sister's life.
She loves that guy!
If you kill his uncle, this
marriage won't take place.
She's not marrying his uncle!
You are just blabbering angrily!
Relationships are
going to get created.
You are his in-law!
But who am I? Nobody! I
can do anything. Anything!
Yes, you can do anything. Go, do
anything but make him understand...
...who Uday Shetty is and what I do?
What I'll do if I get really angry!
Look, shoot his head off,
like this! Brother Uday!
Take this! Take this gun!
...I have a gun!
I will handle him
in such a way that...
...he will come with his nephew's
wedding procession immediately!
You control yourself! Don't worry.
I'm going right away!
Control! Control!
Control! Control Uday! Control!
Control! Majnu sets
everything alright.
Control! Control!
Control! Control! Control!
Hey smarty! Get up!
Give me a gun!
Hold my coat.
I'm telling you for the last time!
Get up or else you'll sleep forever!
I won't get up even if I die.
You won't get up!
Where are the bullets?
In this coat-pocket.
- And the gun on the other pocket!
Have you taken a
contract to kill me?
If we get into trouble, you will
run away and someone would kill me!
Got it!
- Boss, who can kill you?
If I keep the bullets and
the gun in the same pocket...
...then you may go
on a killing spree!
Here are the bullets.
Boss has loaded the gun. You
still have time! Get up or else...
My name is Ghundroo, but
nobody can mess with me.
He won't kill me!
Boss, he is not responding!
But it is my
responsibility to wake him.
Remove his trousers! Strip
him naked! - All right, boss.
Yes, go on! There's no shame in
getting naked in front of a doctor!
Boss, he's already
an immoral person.
Even now he is doing like this.
Boss, forget this middleman.
Let's get the main guy.
If we are gangsters,
mobsters and thugs...
...does that mean our sisters and
daughters should not get married?
You love Sanjana,
don't you? Don't you?
Will you leave her in the lurch now?
Listen smarty! The
invites have been distributed.
The whole city knows about it.
If the engagement
doesn't take place...
...what will happen to
brother Uday's image?
To hell with Uday's image!
My image will be tarnished!
What?
He means his image
will be destroyed! Ruined!
Tell me, will you wake
up your uncle or should I?
Give him whatever drugs
you want. Do anything!
But come to the engagement
ceremony along with him!
Or else I will blow away
your entire family! Blow away!
How... will you blow
them away? Like this!
No... Hey!
Look at that! Look up!
You, your uncle and your aunt!
Will struggle like those pigeons.
Uncle!
Aunt!
And myself!
What am I hearing?
Did you fire at his uncle?
Brother Uday, what could I do?
The old man was acting unconscious.
Old man? Can't he
talk with some respect?
Will you call his
uncle as old man? Old man?
Don't forget that old man
is going to be my relative.
What was the need to shoot at him?
I thought if I scare him with
the gunshot, he might get up.
Ask him what if one of
them had struck my uncle?
What if one of them
had struck my uncle?
My mistake! Sorry!
He is saying sorry!
For how long should I face the
trouble caused by your mistakes?
Did I tell you to shoot?
Did I? I didn't, right?
Why did you fire?
And brother, what
about that matter...
...when he had threatened to kill
uncle and making these gestures?
What kind of
gestures were you making?
How are you going to
kill his uncle? Like this?
We have got an alliance
with so much difficulty.
We have found such a
decent and honest groom.
Will you kill his
entire family? Will you?
You can kill me! Kill me!
But brother Uday, I will not
spare the one who gets you worried.
What should I do with him?
What? What should I do with him?
I can't even kill him!
Because he loves me very much.
Ballu, tell him everything.
Tell him!
I have an artificial limb.
I was a good hockey player.
Once when brother Uday got
angry about something I said...
...he broke my leg
with my hockey stick.
But he's good at heart. He
took me to the hospital. Enough!
He got me a new foot!
- Heard that?
He's good at heart.
He can't see me tense. I
don't have much tension.
Sanjana's engagement has
been fixed on the 13th.
Rajiv is a sensible person.
He will bring back his
uncle to consciousness.
He'll pacify him and bring
him along. Don't worry. Okay?
Then ask him. Will he bring his
uncle to the engagement or should I?
Now you can bring him along, Majnu.
My uncle is like my father...
...I can't tolerate if
anyone insults my father
I love your sister very
much and I always will.
But I will not marry at gunpoint.
Excuse me, sir.
I am leaving. If you want to
stop me, you can shoot on my back.
Rajiv!
Rajiv, I apologize on his behalf.
What are you doing?
A brother has come begging
for his sister's happiness.
I apologize for all the bad
things we have done to you.
Being in this wrong profession...
...maybe I could not
understand peoples' sorrow.
I am repenting for those sins.
I am tired of being refused for my
sister's proposal from everyone.
This is my last chance to
bring happiness to my sister.
So please don't refuse.
It's really difficult to bring
tears in your eyes without glycerin.
Handle the drama from here.
Mr. Ghungroo, I have never
seen tears in Uday's eyes.
But after seeing tears in his
eyes I can say one thing for sure...
...if you don't stop these tears
there'll be floods in the city.
See there.
Now he won't be able
to live peacefully.
Control, Majnu, control.
If he doesn't survive then who will?
Who will!
Only you can stop this calamity.
Stop the time!
Our brother has already left
Italy to attend the engagement.
Which new brother is this?
Uday's and my elder brother.
He is our godfather.
RDX!
RDX?
If you see me coming,
better step aside.
