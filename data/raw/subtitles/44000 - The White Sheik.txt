THE WHITE SHEIK
Beautiful.
Porter! Porter!
Porter! Porter!
Express from Viterbo
arriving on platform 12.
Porter! Hey!
Careful! Is that how you were
brought up? Wanda! The cases!
Give me the hatbox.
There, take this.
And the hardboard suitcase.
Gently! Don't scratch it.
Be careful. It's fragile.
Be sure to stay near me, OK?
- Get off at this end.
- Yes. I'm coming.
Come on, darling.
We've arrived. Gently.
- Where to?
- Hotel Tre Fiori.
Hotel Tre Fiori. Go on, Bianchì!
- Cavoli?
- Cavalli. Ivan Cavalli.
- And the lady?
- Wanda Cavalli, née Giardino.
Furio, double number five
on the third floor.
- Would you like a postcard?
- No, later.
- I have to make a phone call. May I?
- There. 15 lire.
I'm ringing my aunt and uncle.
Excuse me, Reverend.
It's Ivan.
Yes, just this minute.
I rang you straightaway.
Yes, with my wife.
She's dying to meet you.
- Sir!
- I'll put her on.
Wanda wants to say hello
and thank you. Wanda!
Wanda!
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Oh, it's just opposite.
Or you can go that way.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Is Via XXIV Maggio far from here?
- Via XXIV Maggio? Excuse me.
It's down there, at the bottom
of that street.
It takes ten minutes. You go
down the alley, then turn...
- Ten minutes?
- Ten minutes.
By Jove, you're here. Was it a joke?
One, two, three. The hatbox?
It's there.
I was a bit confused when I couldn't
find you. I was saying you wanted...
The porter told me to come up.
Porter? It's not right,
a lady alone with a porter.
I didn't know how to explain it
to my uncle.
He's used to deferential treatment.
He's high up at the Vatican.
Who do you think you're dealing with?
With somebody, that's who.
He just has to do this in Rome
and all Altavilla Marittima dances.
I want to be town secretary
in two months.
And, by the way, he's already got us
an audience with the Pope.
This morning, at eleven o'clock.
At eleven, with the Pope.
- Do we have to talk to him?
- No, I don't think so.
Actually... No, I don't think so.
There are two hundred couples.
If we do, I'll do the talking.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to take my jacket off.
I'm pleased with the time
of the audience.
It doesn't upset my schedule.
In fact, it pulls it all together.
It's organised to the minute,
with no breaks.
7 am arrive in Rome, OK?
Rest in hotel until 10 am.
10 to 11, getting to know each other
and... family relations.
11 am with the Pope,
then lunch with my uncle.
Then it runs like clockwork.
Not a minute to spare.
Pantheon, the Colosseum,
Palatine Hill, Roman forum.
Meet the De Pisis cousins here,
then, together:
Appia Antica, catacombs,
Cecilia Metella, back to Rome.
In the evening, all lit up...
...AItare della Patria.
Then, of course,
dinner for two...
...a little rest...
- The towels.
- The maid.
If you want a bath, give us
half an hour's notice.
Yes.
- Hot water?
- Of course.
- Is there a surcharge?
- 200 lire.
Yes, there's plenty of time, darling.
It's 9. My uncle is coming at 10.30.
That's perfect.
A hot bath for my wife.
And tomorrow
I might have one myself.
And now, while you have your bath,
I'll have a nice little rest.
Have a nice bath, darling.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Fernando Rivoli, please.
Who?
I've an appointment with Fernando
Rivoli. I had to give him...
- He's never here.
- Just to collect his money.
- So, come on Saturday.
- But I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Can I leave him this?
- Leave it on the table.
- Good morning, madam.
- Boys.
Sorry, dear. Hold Antonio.
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Something for Mr Rivoli.
An admirer, so one of our friends.
Take them to my office.
- What's your name?
- Passionate...
- What?
- Passionate Doll.
Lovely. I am Marilena Alba Vellardi.
Marilena Alba Vellardi?
Crime on the Lake, Souls in Turmoil,
Sin in Damascus, Vortex of Love...
I wait all week
for my magazine on Saturday.
I get it at the station, then run
home, shut myself in my room,
then my real life begins.
I read all night.
The real world
is the world of dreams.
Yes. I always dream. There's
nothing else to do down there.
The people are vulgar. The young
men don't even know how to talk.
- When you go for a walk...
- Cigarette?
No, thank you, I don't smoke.
But may I keep it as a souvenir?
Of course.
- Madam, I should go.
- No, no. Sit down.
My dear child, you are right. Idone!
You need to retreat into your own
self, like the Contessina Lucilla.
- In Love and Fate.
- Well done! You remember?
I remember all your characters,
the Contessina, Felga the Gypsy,
Raniero the Adventurer
and that other one...
But most of all the White Sheik.
He's sublime, Fernando Rivoli.
His expressions!
- Good morning, madam.
- Come in, boys. Come in.
We've just sorted out
the page layout for the episode.
- Is it finished?
- Yes. Completely.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
More elegant each day.
- Do you like it?
- Very much.
So, dear. Three letters from Rivoli.
You came to see him. You can think
yourself lucky,
- as he'll be here in a moment.
- But it's late. Too late.
- I only wanted...
- Let's see. Are they photos? Thanks.
What are they? Let me see!
- Did you do it?
- Yes.
Very good. They're really like him.
Just look at this masterpiece!
- Beautiful.
- The turban's exactly right.
What spirit! An artist, too.
You'll see how happy he'll be.
Such a generous, sensitive heart.
- Who typed that?
- The doctor says we have to go.
We're doing it. Wait!
- Has Fernando Rivoli arrived?
- Yes, he's downstairs. We should go.
- Shut up!
- What was I saying?
Let's see. This line might work.
Listen, dear.
If you were in the desert at night
and knew your sheik was in danger,
- what would you say?
- Me? If I was Fatima,
alone in the desert at night,
what would I say?
I'd say, "Oh! I'm very uneasy."
Wouldn't I?
- Beautiful. What a human line!
- Well done!
- I'll write it down.
- Daniela!
It might be simple
but it's enchanting.
- Tell him we're sending it soon.
- I will.
- Dear child.
- We're sending it soon, boys.
Here we are.
Here, boy. These are for Dr Fortuna.
And take the lady to Fernando Rivoli.
Go, dear. Your sheik awaits you.
What's happened here?
Furio, look at the mess!
- Where's my wife?
- How do I know?
Where's my wife?
My wife! Where's my wife?
How do we know where guests go
when they leave the hotel? Postcard?
She asked about the Via XXIV
Maggio. She must have gone there.
- What's in Via XXIV Maggio?
- Furio.
- What's in Via XXIV Maggio?
- I don't know.
Listen!
Listen, tell me
what's in Via XXIV Maggio.
What is there? The Royal Palace.
- And where is it?
- That way.
- Wait here. I'll go and get him.
- All right. I'll wait.
Come on! Hurry up! We're off.
Oscar! Get a move on! We're leaving.
Felga, Oscar, we're off!
Come down, we're going.
Felga, and Oscar the Bedouin
is with you.
Get on! It's getting late.
We're leaving. Hurry!
Get a move on! Get in.
- I'm going in the car.
- It's already left.
- There's no room.
- You can go in the car tonight.
How come Rivoli's always in the car?
- Excuse me.
- Oh. They said you should get in.
- Oh!
- He needs to speak to you.
- Where are we going?
- Get in. It's not far.
Get in, miss. Sit here.
OK. We're leaving in a moment.
Sascali!
Let's be off! Go on! Go!
- Excuse me. Is this XXIV Maggio?
- Yes, from up there down to here.
But what?
Dear Passionate Doll, If you are
coming to Rome, come to see me.
We'll spend some unforgettable
hours together, Your White Sheik.
Fine. I'll see to it.
- Excuse me. Is Mrs Cavalli here?
- She hasn't come back in.
But some people have been waiting
for you for an hour in the lounge.
What? Do you feel ill?
- What's happened?
- Here. Take these.
What happened? Did you trip up?
You've got dirt everywhere.
- Here he is!
- Ivan.
- I'm coming.
- Isn't he elegant?
- Dear Ivan.
- Dear Uncle.
So, you had to get married
to come to Rome?
Dear Aunt.
- Dear Ivan.
- Dear Rita.
- My fiancé.
- Mevaglia.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Very pleased.
- And even Aroldino.
- Hi, my dear.
My dear.
- No. What are you doing?
- No, the lady isn't with us.
She's a guest here. So sorry, madam.
- So, Ivan...
- How's Granny Carolina?
- Very well.
- And Oreste?
- Fine.
- And Teresina, how's she?
- Fine.
- And poor Pasquale?
- Fine.
- But he's dead.
Well, Ivan, no time to waste.
Tell your wife to come down.
- Call Sandra.
- Wanda, Mum!
We should go. You're very lucky
because today's a national holiday.
The whole city's bedecked with flags,
a riot of colour.
It's a historic date for our country.
Can you hear the band?
Come on. Let's go.
The wedding sweets.
- Long life to the happy couple!
- Best wishes. Thank you.
- Thank you, Ivan.
- Thank you.
Well, Ivan? Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Aren't we waiting for your wife?
- For Wanda?
Wanda?
Wanda... isn't very...
A terrible headache.
I told her to take a tablet.
She took a tablet.
No good.
So I said, take another one.
She took another.
A lot of tablets.
Where's my aunt?
Aunt! Stop!
- The Cavallis' room?
- Number five, third floor.
- The Cavallis' room?
- Number five, third floor.
Aunt. No. Just a minute.
Stop the lift.
Aunt! Wait!
Aunt. Stop! I have to talk to you.
Aunt! Stop.
Furio! Bring me the bucket.
What are you doing?
Amalia, this is madness.
Are they all mad here?
- What's happening now?
- That's it.
Ivan!
- What's happening?
- Nothing. Everything's fine.
Wanda's just gone to sleep.
She's been up all night.
We should let her sleep
and see the Pope tomorrow.
Just a moment, Ivan.
Will she eat with us?
Of course she'll be there. Let's go.
Where are we?
ROME 26 KM
My goodness!
Everybody out. We're wasting time.
Where's Rivoli? He's never here.
What's up?
Sorry, but I've got a cold.
Can I keep my shoes on?
A Bedouin chief in shoes? No!
- Listen. I have to get back to Rome.
- So, go.
Get off, you're spoiling my costume.
Come on! The sea's beautiful!
Let's have a swim.
- If you swim you won't get a penny!
- Do you understand?
- Please.
- What do you want?
I want to go back to Rome.
Will you help me, sir?
- Again?
- She needs to get back to Rome.
- I have to get back.
- We all do.
Be quick with the make-up.
Get dressed.
That way! Everyone on the beach
when they're ready.
Tell me where the station is, please.
I have to go.
- There isn't one here. It's in Rome.
- What?
Little boy, where is there a phone?
The White Sheik.
Bonjour.
Hello.
Fernando!
Fernando!
Bonjour.
Mr Rivoli.
- Mr Rivoli.
- Yes.
- Fernando Rivoli.
- You know me?
- I am Wanda Giardino and...
- What is it?
- It's for you, from me.
- For me? What is it?
What is it? A cake?
- It's me.
- Yes.
Well done.
You've done it really well.
"Passionate Doll."
You wrote me a letter.
- Three.
- Three letters.
I remember. Well done.
- Did you think I would be different?
- No. I'm pleased.
It's beautiful. Thank you very much.
Can I... Can I get you anything?
There's a kiosk over here.
Let's go this way. I'd like to.
Here we are, then.
How strange our meeting like this.
I have a feeling, a strong feeling.
It's unreal. Truly, I have.
- Are you Fernando Rivoli?
- Yes.
- Will you sign my magazine, please?
- Of course. You're welcome.
How's The White Sheik
going to finish?
Why do you want to know?
You'll spoil the illusion.
- I hope you marry Felga.
- Let's hope so.
Excuse me. I've got company.
- Would you like this?
- No, thank you.
- I have to go straight back to Rome.
- To Rome? What?
Music. I have to go back to Rome,
too. Let's go together.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
May I?
- Are they shooting a film?
- Almost.
Let's go. Listen! I don't want
to shout. Today's not going well.
Giovanni, hurry up with that eye.
The weather's changing.
- OK. Get moving.
- Get it done now.
Everybody here. Come and listen.
"Assunta, the love of the chief of the
desert raiders..." What are you doing?
- I'm an admirer of the Tenth Muse.
- You can't stay here. Go away.
"...conceived a fiercely daring plan."
Felga, please!
"Oscar, the cruel Bedouin, landed on
the beach at the Harem of Mystery,
"with his legendary Moors from
the ports of the African coast,
"and led his demons to certain defeat
against the White Sheik."
Stop shouting like that.
Silence!
"The African night was at its peak.
"In the salons of the harem,
the beautiful ladies slept languidly,
"dreaming of the White Sheik.
"Only Felga, the mysterious Greek girl..."
Watch those veils.
"Someone else lay awake:
Fatima, the faithful slave girl."
"Oh, I'm very uneasy.
What danger awaits my sheik?"
- Make it more Oriental.
- Rivoli! Here's your horse.
You aren't here to get a suntan!
Bring me the diadem! Run!
"I'm very uneasy."
- Do you think I can do it?
- Of course.
"And the cursed ship sailed out
towards destruction, death and love."
To your places. Let's go.
- Ready Rivoli?
- Ready. My cloak.
Let's go. Quick, before the sun goes.
Hurry with the make-up!
- First camera ready?
- Ready.
- Second camera?
- Ready.
Everybody ready. Let's go.
Let me have a look at you.
Let me see.
Quick. Get on the camel, come on.
Like that.
Pick her up in your arms.
Put your arm behind. Go on.
Go back, back. There, stop!
Look here. Gaze at me. Like that.
- OK like this, sir?
- Bedouins further back.
- Sir, your hat.
- Thank you.
- The megaphone.
- Fine.
Everybody ready to go?
- This one rears up all the time.
- No, it's a statue. Don't worry.
If anything happens to me,
nobody gets to eat any more.
The parasols! Take them away!
Take away the parasols.
Oscar, where are you?
Take your place.
- Are you ready for the duel?
- Yes, I'm here now.
Everybody ready to go?
Bring the harem girl. Ready
with the camel? Bring it forward.
Further forward. Move it!
- Rivoli, get your sword out.
- Like this?
Further forward with the camel.
That's it.
Stop. That's enough. Ready.
Stop. Just there. Ready.
- Who's that cretin? Go away!
- Hey. You need to move.
- Go away! Moron! Go!
- Go away!
- Go away, fatso!
- Go away. We're starting.
- Rivoli, stop!
- I'm ready.
Stop! Snap.
Snap.
Snap.
Snap.
Snap.
Snap.
Don't laugh.
END OF ACT I
ACT II
- Yes, it's Ivan.
- Congratulations, Wanda.
It's Rita saying congratulations.
You're thanking her?
- What? This is Furio, the porter.
- We're off to the theatre later.
- Ask if we can call for her.
- You're not coming? Oh.
What a pity. We've got the tickets.
Rita's fiancé bought them.
He's gone out. And the lady.
There's nobody here.
The main thing
is that you're better tonight.
- We can go up?
- Do you want us to call later? No.
You're sure you don't need anything?
You don't want my uncle... OK,
I'll ring after the theatre... Bye.
- Bye, Wanda.
- It's Cousin Rita saying bye.
Bye. And a big kiss from me.
- Is she coming to the theatre?
- I don't think so.
She hasn't any appetite
at the moment.
- But maybe a little soup...
- For goodness sake, no. Diet.
- Total dieting.
- Yes, I think so, too.
You're right, Uncle. Total.
I was just telling him,
you're excellent at recitations.
Say that one you composed
for your fiancée.
Which? "She is graceful,
sweet and small"?
- An ode.
- A sonnet.
A sonnet.
"She is graceful, sweet and small
- "and everyone calls her..."
- Fettuccine, nice and hot.
Fettuccine!
A generous plateful
to restore your strength.
A cigarette?
I was looking for a hankie.
Thank you.
That must be Fernando's new
girlfriend. What taste!
- Do you like her?
- I like you.
Stop it!
- Haven't you eaten?
- No.
- Do you want it?
- Certainly. No problem.
For me, the sea...
...has an attraction.
I hear its call.
I have done since I was a boy.
I should have been a sea captain.
But instead...
Finished.
Get in. Don't worry. It's fine.
Sir, Nando's taking the boat.
Nando. Where are you going
in the boat? Come back.
Turn back, Rivoli.
- What's he doing with my boat?
- Rivoli. Come back!
Such confusion...
How strange. I don't feel like
myself any more.
The same thing happens to me
when I get into a boat.
A strange, bitter happiness
possesses my whole being.
A seagull.
A lovely seagull.
A happiness that comes from
a later life, a previous life.
Later or previous?
Previous. Who knows
what we were then?
Maybe I was a pirate,
and I've a feeling
you were a mermaid.
I'm so stupid. I'm nearly crying.
And yet I'm so happy.
I'm crazy and happy.
Do you believe me?
Come and sit here. For me, please.
Little girl.
You steer.
- Little girl.
- Here.
- Frightened?
- No.
- Disgusted, then?
- No.
- So?
- So, no.
- Why not?
- Because no.
- So, why did you deceive me?
- I can't listen to you, Fernando.
There are things that are bigger
and stronger than us.
- No?
- What?
I'm not free.
Why? What is it? Are you engaged?
So what, I'm married.
- Married?
- Married.
- Married.
- Are you sorry?
You needn't be jealous.
I don't love her.
Don't judge me harshly. You don't
know. That woman ruined my life.
Really?
- Tell me about it, Fernando, please.
- No, don't ask me to.
The thing is that I...
It's a long story.
- I loved someone else: Milena.
- Milena.
She was so beautiful. Like you.
You are much more beautiful.
I was to marry her,
but on the day of the wedding,
- with a dirty trick, a magic potion...
- What?
A magic potion.
The woman who's my wife
put me to sleep. I slept and slept.
She made me lose my memory.
I swear I was completely lost.
When I came round,
Milena had disappeared.
- Disappeared.
- Maybe dead.
- Dead?
- Who knows?
Poor Milena. A magic potion.
Let's not think about her any more.
Do you forgive me?
Am I worthy of your love?
Oh, yes. Yes.
Now that I've met you,
what does the rest matter?
The past doesn't come back.
Give me a kiss. Kiss me.
Give me a kiss. My God! My head.
The rope!
Encore!
- I'm going.
- Wait.
- Where's he going?
- How do I know? He needs to go out.
- Excuse me, where's the phone?
- Downstairs.
Quiet! Quiet.
Hello. Hello!
Hello.
Hello. It's Mr Cavalli.
- Who?
- Is she back?
- I said no.
- Oh no.
Still no.
Take a seat. Sit down.
Sensitive reasons. Well?
I'm listening.
Will what I'm going to tell you
be in the newspapers?
Why?
Because I have relatives
in high places here in Rome
and I'm very well-known
in Altavilla Marittima.
Sensitive reasons. Which are?
This morning, a lady...
...from the Hotel Tre Fiori,
at about half past nine...
From the Hotel Tre Fiori
she went to Via XXIV Maggio.
And she still hasn't come back.
What's more, they found a letter
in which they don't recognise...
- What?
- He doesn't recognise...
This lady's husband doesn't know
the sender or the recipient,
being sure that she didn't know
anybody in Rome.
So, based on these facts,
they should know... The investigating
authority should know how on earth...
How on earth what?
How on earth this lady
went from the Hotel Tre Fiori
to Via XXIV Maggio.
No, leave it, please.
"My Passionate Doll,
"If you are coming to Rome,
come to see me.
"We'll spend an unforgettable
hour together, Your White Sheik."
The Passionate Doll,
would that be you?
- Me?
- Right.
- Listen, I'm curious.
- Tell me.
Did you find this letter
on the woman in question?
- No. In some water on the floor.
- Oh, right.
The bath water was overflowing. The
letter was floating on top. I saw it.
I suppose she was getting ready
for her bath.
A most sensible supposition.
It makes sense of everything.
- Do you think, Mr?
- Cavalli. Ivan Cavalli.
Ivan Cavalli.
- Of?
- Of?
- Father's name.
- But what's that got to do with it?
- Paternity.
- Don't shout!
I'm not shouting. Your father's name?
- Luigi.
- Luigi Cavalli.
- The lady's name?
- It isn't really essential.
To help you, let me say that I've
been waiting for you for a while.
In fact I was getting worried.
"Why doesn't Mr Cavalli come?"
I asked.
- So, the lady's name?
- Giardino, Wanda.
Now Cavalli?
Please, don't ruin me.
No one must find out.
My father's a veterinary inspector.
My uncle works at the Vatican.
I understand, the Vatican...
Noble sentiments.
- So, is she now Cavalli?
- My career, family honour...
- Now Cavalli?
- Now Cavalli.
Just give me two minutes
and we'll sort this out.
In the meantime, keep calm.
Stay here.
Would you like a cigarette? Please.
Take a whole one.
Just wait here
and don't get worked up. Please.
Don't get worked up.
And you'll see we'll teach the sheik
a thing or two. You'll see.
- Call Dr Bonacci.
- OK.
These times we live in!
We'll all end up mad.
Young man, could you give me
a hand, please?
Thanks very much.
Cavalli, Ivan!
Ivan Cavalli!
Left, right. Left, right.
Right... turn.
About... turn.
To the right.
About... turn.
About... turn.
About... turn.
You thoughtless criminal!
Three hours you've kept us waiting!
We've wasted the whole day.
You've spoilt everything. Tonight
I'm tearing up your contract.
What I created I will destroy. You'll
go back to being a butcher's boy.
- Do you hear him?
- You peasant!
No, don't say a word. Shut up.
You have no idea.
You have no professionalism.
Look at the coward.
You're a certified idiot,
like all your admirers.
- Let me explain.
- Don't try to sweet-talk me.
It isn't my fault.
It's all her fault, this imbecile.
- You're not working any more!
- Let it drop.
What do you mean, let it drop?
I want to explain.
- Look at him.
- He's completely right.
- How is he right? Look...
- I've waited for four hours, you idiot.
- Look, what do you want?
- You should be ashamed.
Who sent him? Now he's starting, too.
Rita! When did you get here?
We're just joking. I went in a boat.
I won't go again!
I got a knock on the head. I was
trying to raise the sail. Bang!
It hit me here on the back
of the neck. Look where it hit me.
This is the new actress.
She's very good. My wife.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm so cold! I'll get dressed
and we'll go straight home.
Hey!
- Me?
- Yes.
Come here, you.
- You dirty tramp.
- What?
You tramp!
- Rita, be good.
- I'll deal with you next.
- You shameless hussy!
- Rita!
Let me go! I'll kill her.
I know all about you. It's terrible.
I know everything. Leave her.
He told me.
I know how you married him, how you
tricked him. It was wrong.
- What's she saying?
- It was a trap. He loved another.
- Another?
- Milena.
But you gave him a potion.
He went to sleep. Well done!
What are you saying?
Do you want to ruin me?
Rita, she's making it up.
I didn't say any of that.
You're telling the story you made up
on the boat?
On my word of honour,
I don't know her.
- Rita!
- Mrs Rivoli.
Mrs Rita!
Nando, she's waiting for you.
Here she is, Nando.
Rita, get on the Lambretta.
I've looked everywhere.
I can't find her.
- What's her name?
- I don't know. Ask Fernando.
- You're asking me?
- You don't know?
- Passionate Doll, she said.
- Passionate Doll.
He says she's called Passionate Doll.
Passionate...
...Doll!
- Let's go home.
- Leave me alone.
Give me a kiss.
I'll strangle you!
- Stop it.
- Bye, sir. Bye, everybody.
- Bye, Rivoli.
- Bye, Nando.
- Are we off? I've waited an hour.
- And that poor girl?
She'll have gone back on her own.
Come on!
Where can she be hiding?
To the cars!
Listen. This chap's clothes
have gone from his car.
- I've said, I don't know anything.
- How?
If you'd locked your car,
it wouldn't have happened.
What a way to think. Are we civilised
or in the jungle?
- Drop it.
- No. I'll go to the police.
Fine, go. Just leave us alone.
- Then I'll have the last laugh.
- Chubby, we don't give a damn.
- Let's go.
- Delinquents! Thieves! Scoundrels!
What are you doing here?
- Where are the others?
- They looked all over. They've gone.
Is this your coat?
I found it on the beach.
Yes. Yes, thank you.
- How will you get back to Rome?
- I don't know.
Stop.
The light's off in the window.
- Wanda must be asleep.
- Yes.
OK. I think that's enough for today.
- Tomorrow, then.
- See you tomorrow.
10 o'clock in the hotel.
- 10 am.
- In the hotel.
11 am audience with the Pope.
I managed to have it postponed.
- You and Wanda, of course.
- Yes, of course. Tomorrow.
1 pm lunch with the De Pisis.
Then Palatine Hill, the Senate, Parliament
and the metro works.
Wonderful.
- Let's go home.
- Keep still.
Well, goodnight. And to Wanda, who
we haven't been able to meet yet.
Goodnight, Uncle. Goodnight, Aunt.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Goodnight.
Goodnight. Thank you
for a lovely day. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodnight.
- Piazza Vittorio, coachman.
- Bye, Ivan.
And don't worry.
Tomorrow Wanda will be fine.
- Take care, Ivan.
- Good Night, Aunt.
Remember, 10 am we meet here.
We meet here.
Goodnight, Ivan.
But you're pining. Why?
- Good evening.
- Is she back?
She isn't back.
Excuse me,
but what can have happened?
Nothing.
The end of the first part
is fantastic.
He asks her if she loves him and
she says, yes, dance with me.
They both start to dance, like this.
I should have been a dancer.
Look. My God, look how drunk he is.
What? Are you crying?
He's crying.
He might kill himself.
Come on, let's go, Cabiria.
Hey, are you going to kill yourself?
Come and see!
- What's happened to you?
- My wife's run away.
- His wife's run away.
- Poor man, look how he's crying.
Listen, sir, have a cigarette.
Assunta, give me a match. Here, sir.
Poor man.
Look at what women can do!
Why did your wife run away?
Did you beat her?
No.
Go on, did you beat her?
- You've been nasty, haven't you?
- This morning...
What?
We arrived this morning, no
problems. On time. Took the carriage.
- What did they take?
- The carriage.
We went to the hotel, I phoned.
It was all set up.
- At 11 we were to see the Pope.
- The Pope?
Yes, the Pope. Why not?
My cousin's been, too.
Yes, he was waiting.
Then we were going out and about,
to the Altare della Patria...
...the Colosseum... But why?
Where has she gone?
Wedding sweets. Can I eat one?
- You were on your honeymoon?
- Yes.
- Yes, our honeymoon.
- My God!
- She's run off with her boyfriend.
- Maybe she's had an accident.
- No, it's no accident.
- You see.
Was she young, beautiful?
Beautiful. Take a look.
There.
What? Your wife's 13 years old?
No, that's her first communion.
This is last year, in April.
The day we got engaged. She's 20.
- She's a darling. Look.
- She's beautiful.
When she was six, at school.
Full marks, except for handwriting.
Two years ago, at the seaside.
Beautiful. Doesn't your wife look
good in a swimsuit?
6 months old, September 1932.
She'd just been born.
Oh! Isn't she sweet!
- Look who it is. Arturo!
- Who's that?
It's Cabiria. Go on,
do some fire-eating.
- No.
- Go on.
- I'm tired.
- Tired? Go on, cheer him up.
- Who?
- Why don't we go to a hotel?
- Him.
- Don't you like me?
Watch. Go on.
Shall we go, then?
You'll get some rest. OK?
Don't you like me?
- Again.
- No, that's enough.
Wait a minute, then.
- Watch! Hey, where are you going?
- Bye, Cabiria.
Again.
- There's the Tre Fiori.
- Thanks. Stop here, please.
So, you really don't want to come
and eat risotto with me?
There's nobody at home.
They're all at Cortina.
- You can stay over if you want.
- Open it for me.
It's a pity.
- No risotto, then?
- Thank you. Please don't insist.
Get away, then, you bitch!
Hotel Tre Fiori.
Hello. Is Mr Cavalli there?
The key isn't here. Wait a minute
till I call him.
No, don't call him.
Let him sleep, poor thing.
Just tell him
not to wait for me any more.
Hello. Hello!
Tell him a fatal destiny has made me
besmirch the honour of his name.
The honour of his name.
But I am innocent and pure.
Tell him...
...that I am stained,
but that I will get out of his life for ever.
Wait a minute while I write it down.
Hello!
Yes. Our true life is the life
of our dreams
but sometimes the life of our dreams
is a fatal abyss.
What? Abyss with a 'b' for boxer?
Can you repeat that, please?
Who's there?
What are you doing there?
Get up out of there!
Mr Cavalli.
This letter was left for you.
Uncle,
I have to talk to you.
- The name of the Cavallis...
- Hello, Tre Fiori.
Mr Cavalli. Just a minute.
Mr Cavalli. Telephone.
Take it here.
Hello. Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Yes.
Where?
Mr Cavalli!
Slowly. Be careful.
- Be careful.
- We must call a doctor.
- Maybe later.
- Go slowly.
Let's get him into bed.
Mind his head, there.
Open the door, please, porter.
Gently. Be patient.
No, stop! Let me go!
Calm down.
Let him get up on his own. Leave him!
Everything's fine.
Nothing's happened.
You can go now.
And we'll all go and see the Pope.
Wanda's ready. She's fine.
Wanda, hurry up a bit, darling.
We're waiting for you.
She says she's coming. You go on.
Don't frighten her.
You go on ahead to St Peter's,
to the Pope.
We'll meet you in half an hour
under the colonnade.
OK, that's agreed. In half an hour
under the colonnade.
Ivan, man to man,
what has happened?
You wait downstairs. Go away!
- Go.
- You're talking to me? Fine.
Talk to me.
I swear on the name of Cavalli,
nothing's happened.
Go to St Peter's.
Nothing's happened.
- In half an hour?
- Yes, at St Peter's.
- In half an hour.
- Yes, under the colonnade.
- Taxi! Where are the taxis?
- That way. No, there.
- Wait here. Don't move.
- No, pay me.
Let go of me.
- Ward Five.
- Straight down there.
Thanks.
Hey, are you mad?
Mr Ivan Cavalli? This is Ciriola,
the man who saved your wife.
It was two o'clock.
I was asleep on my boat...
Good morning, Cavalli.
See how we found her?
Now we're going to find the sheik,
too.
Your wife's in here. Keep calm
and don't get upset.
At 11 o'clock
we have to see the Pope.
You've got five minutes
to get dressed.
I don't want to know anything now.
The honour of the family comes first.
Get dressed!
Here you are.
Your shoes and your veil.
Get dressed quickly!
Quickly!
- Where are you from, dear?
- Caprarola.
- Good. And you too?
- Yes, sister.
Let's go. Quickly. Let's hurry up.
- They're going in!
- What can I do?
Reverend, listen.
Can I have a word, Reverend?
Here he is, Daddy!
Here we are, Uncle.
Tidy yourself up a bit.
- Here you are, Wanda.
- No, not like that.
- Let's go.
- My coat.
Yes. Her coat.
Here is my wife, Wanda.
My dear Wanda.
She's so pretty.
- This is Aroldino.
- Hello.
At last, Wanda, dear. How are you?
- Do you know my fiancé?
- Let's look at you, Wanda.
That bully Ivan wouldn't let me come
up to you, you know.
- Really?
- I wanted to give you some medicine.
You're so pretty,
such elegant clothes!
- And the money?
- How much?
Hurry, we have to catch up
with the other newly-weds.
Thank you. And good luck.
Have you finished paying? Come on.
We have to hurry. The others are
already going into the church.
Yes.
Take off your raincoat.
Your wife on your right.
You go on the right.
Give me your arm.
Give me your arm. That's right.
Are you ready? Let's go.
I didn't do anything wrong.
It's true, you know.
It was fate being perverse,
but I am pure and innocent.
Me too, you know.
You are my white sheik.
Come on, now, quicken up your pace.
THE END
