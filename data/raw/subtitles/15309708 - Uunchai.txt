EUNCHAE's fourth diary.
Friday, April 7th, 2023.
It's already April.
and it's already my fourth diary!
How time flies...
The star I'm meeting today has a very,
very special thing in common with me!
So I have tons of questions I want to ask!
I need to meet her quickly. So excited!
[EUNCHAE's Star Diary]
[The Baby Bank President appears]
Ta-da!
[(Manchae's energy is high today)]
Hello!
[For 4th diary! Who's the star of today's EUNCHAE's star diary...?]
[(Rushing) (Rushing) / She is...!!!]
[(The Baby Bank President is a Panda)]
APINK Bomi is coming.
[APINK is EUNCHAE's true love]
I really loved APINK when I was a kid.
I'm going to make the star diary with Bomi.
[The highest heart rate ever since EUNCHAE's Star Diary started]
I'm so excited. I've never been this excited before!
[(Baby lion is running around in nervousness!)]
What should I do!
APINK started pre-recording.
[(Congratulations APINK for D N D comeback!)]
There's a monitor here in the waiting room.
[(The side-track stage)]
[The Baby Bank President is endearingly monitoring]
Bomi.
[Happy panda is enjoying the performance]
They're so pretty!
[Jaw drops]
[APINK is the best]
APINK.
[With love / Off to cheer for APINK]
[The Baby Bank President's main job /
Visiting APINK's filming location!]
APINK is doing a pre-recording right now.
I'll go there today.
[(Me, Myself & I performance!!) / APINK's perfect live stage]
[Speechless]
[The best) APINK is (the best]
[Time to ditch the duty as Baby Bank President and enjoy]
[(Shining eyes)]
[APINK finished their first pre-recording with Panda]
[About to meet her favorite member!]
She's coming!
[(Maximum nervousness)]
What do I do?
[Holding tightly]
I think I'm going to faint.
[EUNCHAE said "What do I do?" for the 61110th time]
Oh, my. She's coming! She's coming!
Hello.
[Welcome APINK!]
[Bomi is coming]
- Hello!
- EUNCHAE!
[The Baby Bank President is nervous but polite]
You did a good job!
[(Eye contact succeeded)]
[(Bow) / Hong Manchae is so nervous she becomes a greeting robot...)]
Hello. Hello.
[APINK welcomed her even though their were so busy]
- Hello.
- Hello.
[Successfully cheered for the pre-recording]
I was so nervous!
My heart is pounding.
[EUNCHAE's Star Diary]
[Waiting for Bomi at the waiting room]
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.
- I'm a big fan of her.
[(The best) (the best)]
[Ready to welcome her!]
[Knock knock]
[Bomi appears]
[Welcome to "Music Bank" MC's waiting room]
- Hello!
- Hello!
[Awkward atmosphere]
- I'm very shy...
- Me too.
Let's get closer.
Okay!
[The Baby Bank President is a bit tall...?]
You're so tall!
[(Super thick heels)]
Look, I'm wearing bricks today!
[(Meanwhile Bomi is wearing slippers)]
No, you don't have to take it off...
[(Showing her seat after taking off the shoes)]
You can seat here.
[Bomi doesn't know how awkward she is...]
- Your face is so small.
- It's so awkward here...
[EUNCHAE's fourth star! / -APINK Bomi-]
[Starting today's Star Diary with applause]
It's Bomi!
Hello, I am Bomi from APINK.
Nice to meet you.
[Another awkward smile]
Even before I thought I wanted to be an idol!
[EUNCHAE's shy confession]
My first favorite idol was APINK.
[Bomi is so touched]
Thank you so much!
I know all of your songs!
Which one?
[Manchae is APINK's human dictionary]
All of them!
[Debut song]
From "I Don't Know",
[The first song to rank #1 - MY MY]
Do you know any of B-side track?
[Bomi's surprise question!]
If you know B-side track, then you're the real one.
- I have my favorite B-side track!
- What is it?
[EUNCHAE's most favorite B-side track]
"Sunday Monday".
[(So touched)]
[Manchae successfully certified as a true fan of Apink!]
Do you know LE SSERAFIM?
Of course! They're the hottest these days.
[(Really)]
The hottest?
[(Burden)]
Anti T T T fragile...
- Have you seen our performance?
- I think I've watched them all.
[APINK members watch LE SSERAFIM too!]
Our member too.
[A rookie group that looks cool from the senior's POV]
You're all so cool and doing great.
I'm so proud.
[Bomi and EUNCHAE found something in common!]
[The real interview starts now!]
How did you feel when you were invited to
EUNCHAE's Star Diary?
I was worried
because I was so shy,
but the atmosphere is more comfortable than I thought!
[(Phew)]
What a relief.
I'm shy, too!
We have the same MBTI!
ISFP!!!
[Suddenly formed mutual sympathy]
We really observe people's actions and expressions, don't we?
[(That's true)]
ISFPs are really kind, aren't we?
[The World's Nicest ISFP]
That's right.
[Good sync]
- Then we're so kind.
- Right, you really look kind.
[Peace-loving ISFP who dislikes conflict and discord]
- We're a pacifist.
- Totally!
[Let's see the characteristics of ISFP!]
- So I searched about ISFP.
- I really like things like this.
[Found a common interest even before starting]
I love it too!
So, I've brought some ISFP characteristics.
Let's see how many commonalities we have today.
First.
Out of all MBTI types, I spend the longest time
lying on bed doing nothing.
Of course!
Of course!
But not all...
[(Not everyone's like that)]
Really?
Then you're a J!
[No no]
Then, you're a T!
T?
[+ISFP characteristics: They don't like T(?)]
You don't like T people?
[(Bomi don't like T?) (EUNCHAE doesn't like it too)]
It's not that I don't like T type of people!
If people don't agree with me, I sometimes feel sad.
That's right!
I  get tired easily when I'm around someone
who is very extroverted.
I'm so tired right now...
[(Two introverts who want to hide)]
Me too...
I prefer messages over phone calls.
[Agreed for the 100th times!]
That's right!
Actually, I don't like messages either.
[(The 101th common things)]
Neither do I.
I wish I didn't have a phone.
Me too.
So this is how it works.
[Manchae can relate to anything]
I've never seen anyone like this.
The MBTI that best matches with ISFP is ISFP.
You're so right!
[Never endin common things]
But I really think it's true.
Wow, amazing.
[Another ISFP in APINK, Ha-young!]
Our youngest member, Ha-young, appears to be both
ISFP and INFP.
We have the same sense of humor.
[EUNCHAE and Bomi are perfect match]
It's really nice to meet you
Oh, right!
[What did you really want to talk to senior Bomi about?!]
- I have to ask you about this.
- Oh, what is it?
My father
really likes you.
[to. EUNCHAE's father]
Thank you, EUNCHAE's father.
APINK's D N D has been released.
Please check out the song.
Thank you so much.
[Why does Manchae's father like Bomi?!]
My dad and family really love baseball,
and that's why he really likes you.
[(Her Doorin era / EUNCHAE used to be a baseball fan]
My older brother also played baseball when he was young.
- He's an athlete?
- Yes.
You're the queen of the first pitch.
[APINK's Yoon Bomi, showing a perfect opening pitch,
she is indeed the queen of opening pitches]
That's right.
[Unbeatable skills of a baseball fairy]
I heard you're a fan of LG?
[Bomi became an LG fan thanks to her first pitching]
I'm a fan of LG.
I love The Doosan Bears...
[(LG vs Doosan) / It turns out they're rivals in Jamsil]
- Your families love The Doosan Bears?
- Yes!
[Bomi's fan is her rival?!]
But they still like me?
Because you're so good at first pitching.
[Bomi's perfect first pitching]
[Manchae wanted to look like Bo Mi, the queen of pitching]
I aspire to be like you!
I really wanted to throw the first pitch,
[Still have no experience]
but I couldn't.
[Baby Hong Manchae is a batter]
At least once...
[(Quick, quick)]
[Please let EUNCHAE do her first pitch]
Why didn't she throw the first pitch yet?
[(Thanks to Bomi, I feel secure)]
You are the best!
[(April 19th) APINK celebrates their 13th debut anniversary!]
April 19th is the 13th anniversary.
How did you know?
Is it in the script?
[That's what I studied!]
No, it's not written!
[How can you be such a good MC?!!]
Told you, I  really watched everything.
[(Proud) / She checked out all Bomi videos on YouTube]
I also watched Yong Jin's Health Center.
Wow, you're such a cool MC!
[She studied Bomi's variety show history]
You were on a lot of variety and TV shows. A lot!
The variety show that impressed EUNCHAE]
What I remember is...
"Running Man" and "Real Men".
[(I remember)]
[The reason why Bomi did great at these variety show]
Because as an ISFP,
[It's easier to do a variety show than a talk show]
I can't do a talk show because I can't jump in,
[(EUNCHAE can relate)]
and I have to have to be mindful of others.
[ISFP's sense of entertainment!]
That's why I have to make people laugh with my body.
But EUNCHAE's Star Diary is a talk show...
That's why
[It's not easy to be an MC]
it's a bit difficult for me.
I know right.
[(Senior)]
[Bomi has BbomBbomBbom YouTube channel]
- Since I'm doing YouTube.
- You also invite guests there.
[Bomi's talking skills are getting better]
As I tried it, I got better little by little!
[MC EUNCHAE is also growing!]
It's getting better.
What episode is this?
It's the 4th episode!
Ah, I see.
[Bomi's warm advice]
You'll feel better if you keep going.
Thank you.
[(Shy) (Shy)]
[I'll become a better MC in the future!]
I got advice from my senior.
Is there any variety show that you struggled with?
"Real Men"?
For me? It's "Sponge".
I was told to be funny.
[(Not Sponge but Vitamin)]
Ah, it's "Vitamin"!
[EUNCHAE fell silent]
Do you know Vitamin?
[(I don't...)]
EUNCHAE, you don't know "Vitamin"?
"Vitamin"?
[(Crying)]
[(The TV show broadcasted when EUNCHAE was 9 years old)]
How about "Sponge"?
"Sponge"?
[EUNCHAE, about Sponge]
It's a trivia show where you have to fill in the blanks.
I know "Sponge"!
[EUNCHAE knows "Sponge"]
[Relieved]
I know "Sponge".
How about "Star King"?
"Star King" is
a program where talented people come out.
[(Actual introduction text) / Regardless of gender and age!!
Star King is open to everyone with special stories and strong talents!!]
[EUNCHAE really knows!!]
Kang Ho-dong appears on that show.
[They're getting closer]
[EUNCHAE's Star Diary]
We received questions from Panda
[Gathering questions from Panda!]
because you're coming here.
[(I'm sure everyone knows...)]
Does Panda have any questions for me?
[(Tons of questions) / (Thanks to Panda)]
Of course! There are a lot of questions.
As an idol of 13 years, have you recently experienced
any shocking moments?
[Is there any change in your activities]
Shocked?
[(Latte) / Reporters who attended the music show!]
A long time ago, a lot of reporters came.
[(Really?!?)]
Music shows?
- They did a lot of interviews inside music shows.
- Wow, really?
[Important / An improved restroom]
The restroom seems to have become cleaner too!
[Ah! That one!]
That's changed a lot!
[The emerging culture of doing challenges!]
People do a lot of challenges now.
[(Automatic D N D player)]
- Would you do it for me?
- Yes!
[Please look forward to EUNCHAE X Bomi challenge]
[Just like a pro, our bank president
is ready for D N D challenge!]
Since Bomi is a shy person, I want to know
what she considers the most important thing
when making friends
and what she thinks a good person is like.
I have friends who come to see me
[Thankful for friends who give strength]
when I'm having a hard time.
[Friends who congratulate each others]
Friends who sincerely support me when things are going well.
Also I have the members who
- will always be by my side.
- Yes, I also have my members.
[My members]
What are you having for dinner tonight?
The fans sent me lunch boxes,
so I'll save some
and eat them for dinner.
Thank you, Panda.
[Is this right...?]
These days, people do this kind of heart.
[(Like this)]
This is our ending pose.
Oh my God.
[(Your palms go forward)]
Like this?
[(The back of the hand goes forward)]
Like this, like this.
[The heart is a bit... weird]
It's a bit weird...
Do you know a cheek heart?
I know cheek heart.
[Bomi the master of cheek heart]
I can't keep up with the trend either.
That's how ISFPs usually are.
[ISFP can't keep up with trends...]
It's true!
From user Binu.
Your new YouTube video "Let's Eat Together Today"
has good response.
If you have a chance, could  you invite EUNCHAE?
[(Instant invitation)]
Of course, I would!
[We'll give the honor to the questioner!]
Thank you, user Binu!
The concept of this show to become friends with
someone you're not close to?
But we're getting a little closer now, right?
[(Happy panda)]
We should get closer.
[Making sure]
You can't edit this out. She said she'll come.
[See you again in BbomBbomBbom]
- Please adjust the schedule.
- Really!
[It's time to finish the 4th diary!]
Thank you for coming here.
I'm really, really grateful that you're here.
I really
really had fun.
[I should bring all the members in the waiting room!]
I wish the member were here too.
[(Touched) / Manchae, recognized by her idol]
I think it's going to be so much fun!
It seems like you watched us when we debuted.
I sincerely support you.
[LE SSERAFIM is the best!]
LE SSERAFIM is so cool!
[(Yay!)]
You guys are doing great.
[(Are you watching this, my members?)]
I hope the members watch it.
[A good relationship between seniors and juniors]
- I'll continue to be your fan.
- Me too.
Now it's my turn to come to (BbomBbomBbom)!
[Let's eat delicious things together]
I'll be waiting for you.
[(I love it)]
Please invite me.
[The End of the 4th EUNCHAE's Star Diary!]
Thank you!
Friday, April 7th, 2023.
I spent time with Bomi.
I was so happy because we got along incredibly well.
I need to work even harder to become like her.
I'm a successful fan of her.
