[woman] For most
of human civilization,
we believed that we were
Earth's most dominant species.
-We believed that life...
-[creatures screeching]
...could only exist
on the surface of the planet.
Well, after a certain point,
you have to wonder
what else were we wrong about?
[intriguing music playing]
We have mapped
less than five percent
of Hollow Earth.
But our ecosystems
are linked in ways
we never could have imagined.
We are not
two separate worlds.
We're one.
[Ilene] Kong is settling in
to Hollow Earth.
So, the big guy likes
his new home.
We think so.
His species
was a very social one.
It's not natural
for Kong to be so alone.
He's the last of his kind.
-[Kong groans]
-Every day he searches
for a family
that he'll never find.
[roaring]
What about Godzilla?
[Ilene] Godzilla's
on the surface, Kong is below.
As long as they don't venture
into each other's territories,
we've got nothing
to worry about.
-Humanity is lucky...

[reporter on TV]
With some critics
calling out Monarch
for the billions
in taxpayer dollars...
going to Hollow Earth
and classified technologies
like the mysterious
Project Powerhouse.
Well, here to discuss,
Monarch's own,
Doctor Ilene Andrews.
Let's start with Godzilla.
He stopped the attack in Rome,
but he's still in the city.
Should we be worried?
[Ilene] It's clear to us now
that Godzilla is a Titan
who protects us
from other malicious
Titan threats.
Kong's heading in
for the night.
Looks like
it was another rough one.
That's the farthest
he's gone yet.
Maybe he was looking
for a date.
Good luck with that.
I hope he's up
for some interspecies romance.
-[alert beeping]
-[man] whoa.
[automated voice]
Sinkhole detected
in Sector Five.
[woman] That's Kong's
hunting ground.
[suspenseful music playing]
[signal glitching]
Whoa. It keeps doing that.
More electrical anomalies?
[man] Nah,
I don't think so, man.
I haven't seen anything
like this before.
Well, we should
tell Director Hampton.
[sighs] I'll type it up.
This whole place
is an anomaly.
-It's so weird.
-[signal glitching]
[dramatic music playing]
Tell the Italian military
Rome would be flattened
if it weren't for Godzilla.
They can threaten him
all they want.
Just tell them
to find another scapegoat.
Director Hampton, what's up?
Well, [sighs] Outpost One
is still a nightmare,
and they sent this over.
I thought you might want
to take a look.
Is this from the sensor array?
Yeah, we've been getting
some pretty weird spikes.
I mean, it could just
be regular interference.
-Yeah, but it keeps happening.
-Mm-hmm.
We should prep a survey team
just in case.
Okay.
And what about Godzilla?
Oh, he's still sleeping.
Like a big angry baby.
[Ilene] Let's hope
it stays that way.
-[school bell ringing]
-[indistinct chatter]
[teacher] Everyone,
eyes on your own paper,
all right?
Let's make sure
we circle the answers
[muffled]
really, really clearly.
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[muffled speaking]
[scratching]
[mysterious music playing]
[signal humming]
[music swells]
-[teacher] Jia!
-[music fades]
[students murmuring]
[slow dramatic music playing]
[teacher]
Your daughter is intelligent,
but she's not engaged.
Her grades are slipping,
she's not interacting
with any of her friends.
And these problems aren't
going away, Doctor Andrews.
They've been getting worse.
[sighs]
Okay, I'm sorry.
She's just still adjusting
to our world.
I understand that,
but we have
a number of students
who are
culturally displaced and--
Sure, but her culture's
not displaced,
she is her culture.
She's the last living member
of the Iwi tribe.
We're just trying
to reach her.
I know. Join the club.
[slow dramatic music playing]
[indistinct chatter]
[in sign language]
[sighs]
[Jia sighs]
Come on.
[crickets chirping]
[narrator on TV]
For centuries,
the Iwi tribe were
the guardians of Skull Island,
the ancestral home
of the great Kong.
But when
shifting storm patterns
destroyed the island,
the Iwi were annihilated...
-[sighs]
-...with only a single member
of the tribe having survived.
-A young girl...
-[Kong roars]
...found and rescued
amid the punishing storm.
Her fellow villagers
were lost to the tides.
Gone to history, just like
the great Kongs themselves.
Holy shit.
-The Iwi were unique...
-[breathing heavily]
...in the sense that they
had no spoken language.
Many believe
that tribe members developed
the ability to communicate...
[sighs]
[dramatic music playing]
[whirring]
-[footsteps thudding]
-[electricity crackling]
[growling]
-[inhales sharply]
-[objects clatter in distance]
[breathing heavily]
[continues breathing heavily]
[pensive music playing]
[in sign language]
[sighs]
We're gonna figure this out.
[slow dramatic music playing]
[man] Where will you be
when the next Titan attacks?
How will you protect
the things and people
that matter most to you?
Today's podcast
is brought to you
by Gargantua insurance,
the only insurance company
that provides Titan protection
for your home
and personal belongings.
'Cause Godzilla may not care
about your hopes and dreams,
but Gargantua does.
-Okay, Titan truthers!
-[tapping on table]
-Oh, we have got a lot...
-[sighs]
...to unpack on today's show.
[loudly] Recording in progress,
go away!
Uh, yes. I just want
to let everyone know
that there is no...
-[knocking on door]
-I'm gonna kill...
Unbelievable! What?
Uh...
Hi, Bernie.
Ilene Andrews,
we met in Hong Kong.
Oh. Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hong Kong.
Yeah, that was so long ago.
So, no, God, uh, yeah.
That was when
my hair was longer.
You cut your hair. [chuckles]
Highlights too, it's nice.
I was wondering if I could get
your help with something.
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.
Uh, sure.
Sure, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Come on in, Doctor Andrews.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
Just straight down
that hall there.
To the left. Okay.
Have a seat.
What can I help you with?
You know, mi casa es su home.
[Ilene] Okay, so.
The sequence on the right,
this is a signal
that's been interfering
with our equipment
in Hollow Earth.
-Okay.
-And, uh...
And these are drawings
by my daughter, Jia.
And you're gonna think
that I'm completely insane.
No, the patterns are the same
in the middle section.
Yes. Exactly.
[sighs] Thank you.
Look, our analysts,
they don't know
what to make of this.
They're talking in circles,
they're saying
"radio interference,"
"coincidence," but I...
I know that you think
outside of the box.
[chuckles] I didn't know
who else to turn to.
And they sent you
here because...?
No, no one sent me.
I came here on my...
You know,
that's what's ironic.
You know,
Monarch wouldn't confirm
my crucial part
in taking down Mechagodzilla,
which cost me thousands of...
hundreds of subscribers
on my blog.
Oh, and the trolls...
[chuckles]
the trolls online,
they question
every single thing
that I put up.
Especially this one troll.
This one troll named
ghidorastan64.
You ever heard of him?
-No, I don't think I have.
-Great,
because he's a trash bag,
okay?
I'm more qualified
than half of those people
that you have working
over there.
I knew what Godzilla
was going to do
before anybody
at Monarch said...
Which is why I am here,
Bernie. [chuckles]
I am here. Okay?
Can you help me or not?
That depends.
Are you the new boss
down at the Mess?
The what?
The Monarch
Hollow Earth Station.
The MHES, the Mess.
Yeah, nobody calls it that.
I run the Kong
research division
but technically
Director Hampton is in charge
-of general operations.
-Hmm.
Well, Director Hampton
doesn't have a kid
who can talk to Kong.
You want to go
to Hollow Earth.
[gasps excitedly] I'm so glad
I didn't have to say it.
I thought you were never
gonna ask
-but I really do need proof.
-No, I'm not asking.
I mean, that would help me
with my bona fides
for my blog. And I knew
that you would be the person
-to help me do that.
-[cell phone buzzing]
Okay. Well, if this happens,
and that is a big if,
then Monarch would need,
you know,
whatever you guys call it.
Final cut on anything in...
[Bernie] Whoa. I'm sorry,
final cut? No, no, no.
You know, that will destroy
my journalistic integrity.
Shit.
No really true, good
documentarian gives final cut.
I could make you a producer.
Okay, okay! Fine! Final cut!
Final cut! Fine!
Look, something is happening
to my daughter,
and I have no idea
how to fix it.
You work out what's going on,
and I will get you anything
that you want, okay?
That is a promise.
Well, anything is a lot,
but that's very generous,
but I...
-And we have to go. Right now.
-What?
Godzilla is on the move again.
[ominous music playing]
[dramatic music playing]
[roaring]
[roaring]
[distant rumbling]
[suspenseful music playing]
[Ilene] Okay, listen to me.
If Godzilla's on the move,
he senses a threat coming.
We don't know what it is.
[man on phone]
And you're not concerned?
Of course we're concerned,
Senator.
That's why we're monitoring
the situation.
[Senator] Monitor the fact
that if Godzilla heads...
What is it? You just...
-And I am telling you,
-We have a problem!
Senator...
that Kong doesn't
leave Hollow Earth.
Which is why Godzilla has
no reason to retaliate.
[alarm blaring]
[dramatic music playing]
[grunts]
[indistinct chatter]
-What's he doing up here?
-No idea.
-Well, does Godzilla know?
-Not that we can tell.
Yeah, well, it's only
a matter of time.
And what happens if Godzilla
starts heading this way?
Then we all run like hell.
[Monarch agent]
Get up, let's go!
Keep it up. Come on. Let's go.
[groaning weakly]

[Monarch agent 2]
Sedatives in place.
[man over radio]
All right, the good news is
it's just an infected tooth.
But luckily, you've come
to the best doctor in town.
["I Got'cha" playing

[mouthing] ♪ I gotcha ♪

[Monarch agent] All right,
Kong sedation at a 100%.
Vitals stable.
Trapper, you are clear to swap
the damaged tooth
with replacement.
[buzzer sounds]
Way-hey! [laughing]
Touchdown, Trapper.
[Kong snoring]
[grunts]
[Kong exhales]
Whoa. Fella.
What'd you have for breakfast?
["I Got'cha" continues playing]
[loudly] All right?
Yeah, this sucker's ready
to come out.
[whirring]
Whoa.
All right, let's roll!
[engine accelerating]
[tooth squelches]
[Kong groans]
[laughs]
[door hissing]
[intriguing music playing]
There she is.
Trapper.
Thanks for getting down here
so fast. Nice work.
You are most welcome.
It's not every day
you get to climb
inside a 300-foot ape's mouth,
is it?
Yeah. And you're sure it's
gonna be strong enough?
The tooth? Yeah.
That's the same
polymer composite
they use on the vehicle
heat shields.
[groans sadly]
[Trapper]
He could chomp through
the Eiffel Tower
with that thing.
[chuckles] Well,
good teeth aren't gonna help
if Godzilla senses
that he's up here.
Well. You can't have a Titan
with a toothache,
can you? [chuckles]
-No.
-Don't worry.
Couple of hours
he might be a bit groggy,
but he'll be good to go
back down.
You know, when I first heard
that you were gonna be a vet
I thought no.
That is way too boring
-for Trapper.
-[chuckles]
Then you go and become the
weirdest vet in the world.
Yeah, it's basically
me and Doctor Dolittle.
Except my animals are bigger.
I thought finally, someone has
made him grow up.
Nope. Someone tried that
back in college,
-but... didn't really work.
-Oh, yeah?
Yeah,
what was it she said to me?
"Trapper,
you are not a serious person."
Oh, she sounds very smart.
Yeah, ish. She got a PhD.
-Two, actually.
-[chuckles]
How's the kid doing?
[Ilene] You know. Struggling.
Trying to find her place
in the world.
Yeah, I know how that goes.
Don't worry,
she'll be all right.
She got a good mum.
[in sign language]
[groans softly]
[grunts softly]
Doctor Andrews. Your guest
has been asking for you.
[Bernie] Please don't take this
the wrong way,
but can I just say,
that your research library
has many glaring omissions.
I had to call in
some serious favors
from my Discord chat.
They were not...
Bernie, do you have something?
Yes, I've got something.
I do have something.
Whatever signal
you guys are picking up,
okay, we have seen similar
patterns repeating over time.
And each spike corresponds
with a specific Titan event.
Can you hold this, please?
Thank you so much.
Okay, check this out.
See this? King Ghidorah, huh?
First encounter with Godzilla.
-Mm-hmm.
-Here, uh,
discovery of Skull Island.
All right. So what you're
saying is that these signals
-aren't just random patterns.
-Yeah, it seems that way, yes.
And Godzilla's
picking up on it?
Oh, I can do you one better.
Now, look,
I've looked
at points of similarities
in each wave form
and I compared them
-to that pattern, and...
-Bernie, what are you saying?
It's a distress call!
It's a distress call.
A psychic energy SOS.
Now, if your daughter is
seeing these symbols,
then something down
there is calling for help.
[suspenseful music playing]
[Ilene] Regular soundwaves,
they can't propagate this far
without decay. This?
This is something that
we have never encountered.
-And it's getting stronger.
-You got a working theory?
Yeah,
telepathic alien language.
It's some sort of
distress signal.
Signal? From what?
Or from who.
Well, whatever it is,
this is why Godzilla's
on the move?
We can't say for sure.
But it seems that way.
[Hampton] Well, we have
to figure this out fast.
The wolves are already
at our door.
The government has been
looking for an excuse
to take over
Hollow Earth operations.
And the corporations
are licking their chops.
Yeah,
because who wants to be rich
and get rid
of all the monsters?
I mean, that'd be terrible,
right?
We'd better find the source
before D.C. gets wind of this.
[sighs] Okay.
I'm giving you
full operational oversight.
Take a small team.
Mikael, make it fast
and don't let anyone die.
We'll be in and out of there
before nightfall.
You, uh, you feel like
going for a ride?
Thought you'd never ask.

Hey. Hey! Doctor Andrews. Hey.
Come on, we had a deal!
Bernie, this isn't sightseeing.
It's a reconnaissance mission.
[scoffs] So, I see how it is.
When you need something,
it's all
"you're so smart, Bernie,
you're so capable, Bernie,
"I'll subscribe
to your Titan blog, Bernie,"
and when I deliver it,
you toss me aside.
Okay, look.
This could be dangerous.
[scoffs] Come on.
[chuckles]
I'm no stranger to danger.
I didn't mean to rhyme
that time.
Look, you owe me. Okay?
I helped crack this thing.
This could be like last time,
when we saved the world.
Remember? Hmm?
-Mikael?
-Yeah.
Prep a seat for one more.
Thank you, Doctor Andrews!
You will not regret it.
You're kidding, right?
I'm the plus one. Hello.

So, is there, like,
a in-flight briefing
that I should know about?
You know...
-Yeah, there is.
-He's very...
There's no parachutes,
no flotation devices,
you touch any of this stuff,
you lose your hand,
and if you die,
make sure
it's outside my vehicle.

Where? What?

Those are vertacines, Mikael.
They're called vertacines.
-Um, are they a problem?
-[mouthing]
[Trapper] No.
They're totally harmless.
Unless you get 'em riled up,
and then they pack
about a lightning bolt
worth of bioelectricity.

Predators know
to stay well away.
Which makes them
the perfect chaperone
if you happen to have
a cool biomimicry camouflage.
Which we do.

Well, there's
no heat signatures.
So much for survivors.
God, have some respect.
These people had families.

What could have done this?
I don't understand,
we've had this outpost
for years without incident.
So, why attack now?
What changed?
Hey, Doc.
There's a camera here.
You reckon you can pull
any footage off of that?
Oh, shit.

No, that's not Kong.

and one giant leap for...
Who are you talking to?
Are you kidding me?
Right down the lens?
It's a documentary.
You wanna be natural.
Just walk, if you just walk.
-All right, just keep...
-Yeah, just... Okay. Take two.

The Hollow Earth. A world...
[Mikael] All right, guys.
That ridge you pointed out
is about two miles
straight ahead.
[mosquitos buzzing]
I'm getting eaten alive
out here.
[mosquito buzzing]
Oh, look at that.
I must be tasty too.
Kill it.
Only female mosquitos
drink blood.
So they can grow their eggs.
[mosquito buzzing]
She needs it more than me.
[captivating music playing]
[Trapper] Wait.
-[Ilene] What?
-What's the holdup?
Not this way.
What? Why?
Yeah, we gotta take a detour.
There's something here.
Where, here? Like here, here?
[Ilene] Hey.
Nah. I'm not picking
anything up.
No. Something
doesn't smell right,
and it's not just you, Mikael.
Can you smell that?
It's like rotting flesh.
It's probably
just a carcass upwind.
-We keep moving.
-Mikael, hold up.
Listen, pal. I'm gonna trust
my state of the art thermal
over your
Ace Ventura
hippie-dippie sixth sense
all day long. You got me?
There's no need to call
people names. We're just...
Hey. And as for you,
freak show,
if you don't shut it,
I'm gonna take that camera,
I'm gonna shove it
right up your arse.
I'm in charge, we move.
Why don't we just listen
to somebody calmer?
I said I'm in charge.
I'm in charge! [yells]

-[all gasp]
-Run!

[Bernie] It was a tree.
It was a tree!
[Trapper] Wait, wait, wait.
We should be all right.
We should be all right.
Those things
don't reach that far.
He was just eaten by a tree.
-[Trapper] What you doing, Doc?
-[radio beeps]
[Ilene] I'm trying to call
the Base for extraction.
[Bernie] It's just, one minute
he was there, right?
He was right in my face.
And then, a tree!
-Outta nowhere!
-I know, man.
I know. That's heavy.
But that's
the natural world, man.
"Red in tooth and claw."
Tennyson.
You just watched a man
get devoured
by a topiary nightmare,
and you want to quote
Tennyson? Down here?
Yeah. Yeah, man.
He knew all about it.
"Let love clasp grief," man.
Come here.
[Bernie] Mm.
You know, humans,
we think we took
ourselves off the food chain,
but maybe, maybe the Titans
are here to remind us.
I think that
there is something
seriously wrong with you.
-Okay.
-Mm-kay.
-Okay.
-Mm.
-[radio beeps]
-[sighs] It's not working.
We better move on.
We'll mourn later.
Jia. Come on.
-Come on, bud.
-But the...
He was eaten by a tree.
I don't...
I don't want to die like that.
Not by a tree.
[crowd screaming]
[Godzilla growling]
[pilot over radio] Tower,
we can't get
any closer than this.
Godzilla's burning hot
with radiation.
Whatever he's headed for
has him really pissed off.
[roaring]
[Hampton over radio]
This is Base
calling Fifteen Alpha, over.
Fifteen Alpha responding.
Godzilla's current trajectory
is showing
[over radio] him heading
towards the Arctic Ocean.
[Hampton]
What Titans are in the area?
[alerts beeping]
[commander] Looks like
he's hunting Tiamat.
[automated voice]
Classified file three two four.
Titanus Tiamat.
Titan nineteen.
Extremely aggressive,
territorial.
Weaponizing her body
of razor-sharp scales...
Tiamat's Arctic lair
sits in the direct path
of electromagnetically charged
solar winds,
making it the largest
stockpile of energy on Earth.
If Godzilla takes down Tiamat,
he'll supercharge.
[gasps]
[Ilene] It's ruins.
Human civilization?
Down here?
[Ilene] Hey.
[in sign language]
Yeah.
The markings are older

on Skull Island.
Centuries older.
[Ilene gasps]
But the architecture is

-Jia.

-Wait, wait, wait.

What the...?
Now, that is a trip.
Great Mulder and Scully,

What could have created this?
Ancient alien astronauts.
Yeah.
[eerie music playing]
[Trapper] Look at this here.
The water's
running underneath.
And this is organic.
[crackles]
Yeah.
Some kind of bioelectric hub.

Wow.

Should she be doing that?
She shouldn't be doing that,

I knew I felt something.
Come on, then.

[Bernie] Oh, my God. [gasps]
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

It's going away. Okay.
[suspenseful music playing]
[tense music playing]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
[dramatic music playing]
[Ilene] What?
[Bernie gasps]
It's an entire
Iwi civilization,
protected within Hollow Earth.
[gasps]
These structures,
they look like they've been
carved from
some enormous quartz crystal.
That must be
their energy source.
I'm feeling the energy,
but let's just keep it
together, all right?
[in sign language]
Oh, my God.
It's an undocumented vortex.
Looks like several of them,
actually.
Routes to the surface.
These could lead
all over the Earth.
[Bernie] Oh, wow.
That's incredible.
You should make
eye contact with them.
It's considered polite.
[Bernie clears throat]
[splutters] Yeah, this is not
working for me.
-[bell tolling, echoes]
-Oh.
[bell tolling, echoes]
[mystical music playing]
How are they communicating?
Telepathically.
[Ilene] Okay. No, I, no,
no, no. You can't take her.
I think she's taking her
to the...
Well, let me come!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Bernie] Hold on, okay,
we're not resisting.
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't know where
she's taking her! Hey!

Thank you.
[in sign language]
Of course.
[Trapper]
What's she saying, Doc?
The beacon that we've been
following, it's...
It's the Iwi calling for help.
-[Trapper] Oh. Whoa.
-[Ilene gasps]
So, wait. They send out
this SOS, and then what?
Godzilla hears it?
Yeah. They woke him up.
An SOS for what?
They already live
in a nightmare
monster hellscape.
What could possibly
scare them?
Hey. She can understand
everything that you say.
-She understands me?
-Oh, good.
And a nightmare
monster hellscape
is a wonderful place
to raise a family.

[mysterious music playing]
[liquid chiming]

[Bernie breathing heavily]
[Bernie laughs]
[Trapper] Oh, wow.
[Ilene] This whole room
is covered in Iwi script.
It says that in the beginning,
Hollow Earth lived in harmony
with the surface world.
The Titans were
the guardians of nature
and the Great Apes became
the protectors of humanity.
But a great evil
threatened the peace.
A powerful and ruthless ape
desperate to conquer
the surface world,
led his tribe into war
against the one they call...
The Monster Who Ate a Star.
Godzilla.
[Ilene] There's more.
The war with the Apes
nearly destroyed Godzilla.
But after a great battle,
he imprisoned the apes
in a fiery realm
of Hollow Earth.
Their false king
remains obsessed
with reaching the surface.
The Iwi call him
the Skar King.

[Ilene] Trapped within
their subterranean realm,
the Skar King harnessed
a terrible power.
The ancient Titan, Shimo.
[Shimo screeching]
[Ilene] He controls her
with pain.
Her power covered the Earth
in the last ice age.
We brought Kong down here.
He's been looking
for others like himself,
going deeper
into Hollow Earth
and getting closer
to their prison.
The Iwi must have known
it was just a matter of time,
and that's why they've been
calling for help, and that's
why Godzilla's changing.
He's gearing up
for World War Three.
Okay, but he barely survived
last time.
What's Godzilla
gonna do on his own?
He won't be on his own.
The Iwi believe
that at the end of the world,
one of their own
will return...
and awaken Mothra,
defender of the Iwi...
and ancient ally of Godzilla.
They believe
that their savior will be
an Iwi from Skull Island.
That seems like a lot
to put on one kid.

We've closed the shipping lanes
within 300 miles.
Plasma readings indicate he's
absorbing everything in there.
[energy pulsing]
[Ilene] You know, I made
a deal with myself
when I became a mother.
I said to myself, "I don't care
what you have to sacrifice...
what you have to give up,
you will do right
by that little girl."
[children laughing]
I just never thought that
the thing I'd be giving up
would be her.
Look, you don't know that.
Really?
Trapper, before we came here
she said that
she didn't belong anywhere.
If this is the life
that she wants,
then I have to give her up.
[rumbling]
[Trapper] Am I having
a funny turn
or does everything feel
lighter down here?
[Bernie mumbles incoherently]
[Bernie] Wait, wait, wait.
[Bernie gasps, chuckles]
[Trapper] What are they doing?
That must weigh a ton.
[Bernie] Yeah. Yeah, see,
I don't know
how they can do it...
but somehow they're able to
move the pyramids' positions,
which disrupts the
gravitational pull
down here,
and that's how
they run their city.
An entire civilization
built off the manipulation
of gravity.
God, I wish
was streaming this live!
What you gonna do
with that, Bern?
Look, I know
what you're thinking,
but you don't understand.
Okay?
To have been through
what I've been through,
seen what I seen
and have absolutely
nobody believe you.
This place...
This place is special, man.
It's magic.
How long do you think
it'll stay like that
if you start posting that
about, hmm?
Like, you look at any isolated
tribe or community,
how many of them
survive contact with
the outside world, hmm?
You know I think
you're brilliant, don't you?
You already saved
the world once.
Can't take that away from you.
Could you say that all again?
The last part,
so I have it on footage.
What?

Oh, well, we have to find out
what that was, right?

at that arm, big guy.
[device trilling]
Trapper, he looks really hurt.
Yeah, it's not great.
I'm seeing nerve damage...
significant tissue loss.
[Ilene]
So, what are we saying?
He's not gonna last a day down
here with only one arm.
Yeah, communication
to the surface is still out.
If I can get back
to the outpost,
I think there might be
some supplies
that we can use.
I don't think a massive cast
is gonna solve the problem.
I wasn't talkin'
plaster of Paris.
I'm thinking
more along the lines of, uh...
Project Powerhouse.
[thrilling music playing]
You can't be serious?
Oh, I'm deadly serious.
That prototype
was almost finished
when they pulled the funding.
All right, well, what are you
still doing here?
I love you, too, Doc.
Project Powerhouse, what is...
what is that, exactly?
[Ilene] After Mechagodzilla,
we realized that there were
some threats that
even Kong couldn't face.
So, we started working on some
minor augmentations.
Oh.
Wait, what kind of
augmentations?
[Ilene] Making one of
the strongest Titans
even stronger
didn't go over so well.
So, we got shut down.
Lucky for us, the prototype
had already been transported
to Hollow Earth for testing.
It's stored in the armory
at Outpost One.

those two met up
it was almost the end of Kong.

He is taking a hell of a risk.
If Kong invades his turf,
could start a war.
Yeah, that's
a suicide mission.
But if Kong draws Godzilla
down here...
they can make their stand
in Hollow Earth
and then there's
a chance that
Godzilla can stop
