Young-goon before the incident?
For instance, did she stop
eating suddenly?
I'm afraid I didn't have time
to notice things like that
Visual Effects / LEE Zeon- hyoung
I'm so busy at the restaurant.
Truth is, my mother
was raised by Young-goon.
Pardon me?
No, I mean, my mother
raised Young-goon.
- That's why the young one talks
- Three, push metal plate 2 x 23 in...
- rather like an old person.
- and set it on the back case
Editors / KIM Sang- bum, KIM Jae- bum
Could I meet her grandmother?
She went to a home for Alzheimer's.
She ate nothing but radish
for six months.
- Radish?
- Like for pickled radishes.
- Bolt 1.7 x 4
- I see.
Yes?
70kg of tripe, did you get
the head meat, ears, liver, and womb?
No, we need to get at least 100kg.
You know it's hard to get nowadays.
When I was young,
Once when I was little, I came home
early from school with a bad headache.
- A head?
- Yeah, head meat.
No, get 60kg of tongue.
Yeah.
It hurt so much that
as soon as I got home...
I started calling from the yard!
Mom!
Mom!
Five, fasten the insulator to

to the home for eating radishes, too?
The smell was really bad
whenever she ate radishes.
10 to 25...
- Were they pet mice?
- Normal.
They were strangers to me.
- Seven, once the check is done...
- The check.
- Pull the antenna up high...
- The Antenna.
Turn the frequency knob to find
a broadcaststation.
Broadcast, brooadcast.
Eight, split the end of the wire
in two and take of the covering
My mother told me.
She had a secret that
she really shouldn't tell.
But she didn't want
to hide it anymore
That those mice were
my little brothers and sisters.
'As much as you're my daughter,
so are these mice'
'I am the mother mouse.'

- I see.
- Nine
- Cut left wrist with knife...
- Wrist... knife...
My poor mother.
Mother was always so timid...
- Put in the uncovered wires...
- Wires...
Did Young-goon know about
her grandmother's story, too?
Bind it with duct tape.
- Young-goon?
- Tape.
Of course not.
Mother probably felt a little
closer to the mice that day.

Ten, plug into an outlet.
Plug.
Did Young-goon ever say
Producer/ LEE Chun-young
she was something else, too?
Never, doctor.
Young-goon is a human being.
Her grandmother's thing
wouldn't have much to do...
with Young-goon's trying
to commit suicide, would it?
I'm a Cyborg, but that's OK
My girl will be okay, right?

I wonder if a kid like you
could take the food here.
What could your parents
be thinking of, sending you here?
After all, parents are always
the most important factor.
For girls,
it's especially the father.
Like for her over there.
They say 10 years ago,
a patient disappeared.
His name was Oh Dong- soo and
he was thin and pale like rice paper.
And he was plagued
by non-stop hiccups.
The staff, the military and police,
they searched everywhere for him
They even had the hounds up
in the mountains.
Said he was a dangerous psychopath.
About a week went by...
before they realized this clock
was making hiccupping sounds
He was comfortably
curled up in here, dead.
Listen.
That sound.
I can't live
like this anymore.
Come over here.
Look at here.
Believe it or not, kid.
This is crazy!
- Listen everyone, this is insane!
- Dae-pyong, calm down!
Who put you up to this?
You thieving bastards!
How dare you imprison a police
officer on duty! Bastards!
- Catch Park Il-soon!
- Calm down! Dae-pyong, please!
- Calm down!
- Police!
911!
Dr. Kim!
He did it again.
A police officer?
Who is he kidding?
He's just a uniform freak.
He put on a schoolgirl uniform,
killed his wife...
And burned his house down.
Let's change the subject.
That guy in the mask, they say
he used to be really handsome.
But after he was gang raped
in the army, he went mad.
He blamed his handsome face and
burned it with cigarette butts.
Then he sewed up his own anus.
That man over there.
He's a farmer from Kyung- san.
A nice, quiet bachelor all his life,
good to everyone in the village.
But he fell in love with a calf
that he delivered himself.
Its name was Jenny, I think.
He brought it into his room to live
It couldn't talk, didn't have hands,
but he would wash its face.
And listened to the radio with it,
and soon.
The town folk thought he was a freak
and had him put in here.
But he really only loved
Jenny platonically.
I'm depressed.
Who's this chick?
Huh?
I don't know.
Sul-mi! You're not supposed to
take a patient around like this.
Not my fault.
Someone left her with me.
Don't be that way with me, doctor!
You know I'm sick! You shouldn't
embarrass me like this.
Did she tell you many stories,
Young-goon?
The things she tells you...
That's right! They're all lies!
Yes, they're all lies.
It's called mythomania.
She has an illness that makes her
tell tall tales.
She loses all her memory each time
she gets shock therapy
So she makes up stories to
take the place of her memories.
What's wrong?
She won't talk.
Psychotic depression?
Her grandmother was schizophrenic.
Thought she was a mouse.
Was she afraid of her mother-in-law?
How'd you know that?
I once saw...
Two patients who thought
they were mice.
They both said they were afraid
of their mothers-in-law.
I don't know where to start with her.
She won't stir a finger.
Her eyes are out of focus.
Hey kids!
I'm here. You fluorescent lights.
No use pretending
you don't understand me.
Lights here aren't very friendly,
are they?
No matter how tired you are,
it's bad manners not to say hello.
How are you,
after working all day?
Really?
Then...
Perhaps some adlay tea, please?
Thank you kindly.
Maybe the lights in the wards
will be friendlier.
Since they rest at night.
So you knew from the beginning
that you're a light?
I only found out later in life
that I'm a cyborg.
The white 'uns came and took
my granny away in an ambulance.
You know the white 'uns!
They're all over the place here.
They wear white-doctors, nurses...
Granny!
Right, and orderlies!
- She took the radish.
- Granny!
But left her dentures.
So I ran after her with them.
Granny needs them to eat radish.
She's a mouse, you know.
Just then, a bike came up
and took me.
But a bike can't beat an ambulance.
Even a kid in knickers knows that.
So I bawled and you know
what the bike said?
'A cyborg can beat anything.'
'How come you don't know that
when you're a cyborg yourself? '
So I had to pretend
I had always known.
But the problem was I couldn't
catch up to the ambulance for real.
So, ask me what I said
to the bike then.
'Confounded fool,
I'm all out of battery, you moron.'
So I endeavored to recharge
by listening
to educational broadcasts
at the factory.
I'm only fully recharged
when it lights up to here.
But look, I'm almost on empty.
I did as the broadcast told me,
and the ambulance brought me here.
I'm a machine, but...
I didn't come with an instruction
manual or a label on me anywhere.
I still don't know what my purpose is.
What was I made for?
You didn't eat your lunch, did you?
You won't be able to starve
yourself to death that way.
The cafeteria ladies keep tabs
on everything you eat.
A girl like you once tried
to starve herself to death.
She was so enthusiastic.
But hospitals have
force-feeding machines.
Doctors and professors meet
to confer on how to feed you...
It's embarrassing to have them force
food up your nose in front of people.
So that girl is still eating,
and alive and kicking.
Sad, isn't it?
So I was thinking...
Want me to help you?
Broadcast, broadcast!
Brooadcast!
Listen. There are some
really good messages.
Time for meditation.
Get up and listen to the hum of
the fridge in the middle of night
On a cold winter morning.
Feel the sound of the boiler
that has been running all night
They move us to tears because
they have a purpose of existence.
Think of the lighthouse's holy
and beautiful heart of love.
To be continued.
If only I had just one
purpose of existence, too.
Il-soon, please, your mask!
Will the pretty Gop-dahn
please explain?
Our hospital has stabilizing rooms...
for those who cause discomfort
too thers or create safety issues.
And when it is deemed
a necessary treatment...
- With the patient's consent.
- What consent?
You told me to stay in
the stabilizing
room until I gave my consent!
I told you before that if you hit
others for no reason like that...
You have to go in the stabilizing room.
But Il-soon is a thief!
A detestable and shameless psycho,
anti-social and schizophrenic!
Isn't that an attack
on his character?
It's not an attack!
It's defense!
He stole something
very important to me!
Alright, what did Il-soon steal
from you, Dae-pyong?
They all point to me
if anything goes missing.
For the past 3 days, I can't
even receive a simple serve.
While Park Il-soon won 5 games
just yesterday!
With the unique service technique
that I developed 12 years ago!
There's no point not stealing.
They all think I did it anyway.
Come on, that's not true.
...12 years ago!
I see, you lost your ping-pong game.
It was about a month ago.
I suddenly lost my appetite
and couldn't eat.
Think of what it did to my skin!
Il-soon came and ate all my food.
He's the one who stole the elastic
band around my waist
for a whole week.
The elastic band
for your pajamas?
No, this skin colored elastic band
I was born with around my waist!
Look at this.
It's all stretched out!
Does he mean he was born
wearing pajamas?
Then is Il-soon the one who stole
my memory, too?
You bastard!
You thief!
- Give me back my ping- pong!
- You stretched my band!
Mr. Pajamas, please!
I told you your mother
didn't leave because of you.
Yeah, right!
Then how come she never
called but once?
To tell me not to forget to
brush my teeth before bed!
Fine! I'll admit it!
Last night, I stole Thursday.
Whose Thursday?
How can a person steal Thursday?
Look, Thursday's panties are missing.
Monday's are right here, where else?
I had no idea.
He's really good.
This is a fortuitous crossing of
paths, for sure.
I must find out more about this thief.
I have this thing
I want someone
to steal away from me.
I don't know how I'll ever thank you.
So sorry for being so slow!
Hello, everyone!
How are you?
- Have you had lunch?
- Sure.
Yeah, I have.
Have you had lunch?
Don't skip the meal.
Psycho.
I'm not a psy-cho.
I'm a cy-borg.
Ah, I let slip.
I promised Mom I wouldn't.
Mom, I think I'm a cyborg.
What's that?
I think it's kind of like a robot?
Have you missed a period?
Because you're a cybor?
Anything you want to eat?
Like radishes?
Then it's okay.
Now go get some sleep.
It's okay if you're a cybor.
It won't interfere with
the way you live.
Just don't let anybody know.
Who would come to eat at a shop
where the daughter's a cybor?
Cyborg, are you thinking of
your Granny?
I certainly am.
You aren't feeling sad, are you?
No, why of course not!
She's wondering about you, too...
And why you haven't killed
the white 'uns yet.
She wonders why you don't bag
the white 'uns that dragged her away.
And bring her the dentures.
But I...
I don't have enough power.
This charging method seems to
have its limitations.
I hope it's not
because of sympathy.
You know that sympathy is
the worst of the 7 Deadly Sins.
No, really...
It's not because of sympathy.
For your reference,
the other 6 are as follows.
Being sad.
Restlessness.
Hesitating about anything.
Useless daydreaming.
Feeling guilty.
Thankfulness.
The above was in
the order of evilness.
Yes
Useless daydreaming about whether
the white 'uns have grannies, too...
Sympathy for their grannies
if the white 'uns died...
And hesitating about killing them.
You must forego these sins.
Floriculture Therapy
Take your ping-pong back.
It makes my butt itchy
every time I play.
The right cheek.
Transfer!
- Go Dae-pyong!
- Go, doc!
He is very polite.
He's so humble he can't
even walk forwards.
Court etiquette, he says.
He thinks it's his fault
when anything goes wrong.
Are you there?
- Hello?
- What is it?!
Just wondering if it was
my fault you lost?
He happened to drive past
the scene of an accident...
And he was convinced
it was his fault.
He followed the victims around
apologizing.
When they couldn't stand it
any longer...
They reported him and
he was brought to this hospital.
I said no!
It wasn't your fault, Duk-chun.
It's my ping-pong!
It's too itchy to play!
Duk-chun is an expert at saying
redundant things.
Isn't ping- pong about
giving and receiving?
I don't think so!
Must one always receive
after giving?
Can't there be ping- pong
where we only give?
So it was my fault.
A cat is, above all,
a furry animal.
Actually, my wife is furry, too.
Isn't it obvious I'd become impotent
with a furry wife?
I'll hear from the judiciary soon.
I filed a suit against her.
She hid that she's a furry monster
when we got married.
Making a police officer impotent is
an obstruction of his duties.
Alright, transfer!
Hello, there!
How are you all doing?
Have you had lunch?
Hello!
How are you? Hello!
Have you had lunch?
Oh my god.
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
- How can I tell you how sorry I am?
- I'm so tired!
I'm sorry I made you tired.
Why do I always tire people out
like this? I'm sorry.
I had a dream...
To make amends to everyone
I've ever troubled.
People should make amends
whenever they've caused trouble.
But now...
I've had all my politeness stolen.
Now how am I supposed to apologize?
Do you remember
where you lost it?
You people don't know what
it's like to have troubled others!
You bitch!
Please steal it.
My sympathy.
Like Thursday.
Sympathy?
What's that?
The feeling that stops me
from killing those I should.
I keep thinking...
What if I killed the white 'uns...
And they have grannies, too?
The poor grannies...
Look, miss.
When you speak to a person,
You have to speak so that
the person can understand.
Well, sympathy is...
My mom, aunt and uncle
shouldn't have acted that way!
How could they have
so little sympathy?
No one's a mouse because
they want to be a mouse.
Don't even talk about moms!
I'm sorry.
And if you keep asking me
to steal something...
That's not stealing. It's just
taking what you're giving.
Then what should I do?
Well, when I...
When I set out to steal
something from someone...
I have to watch that person
stealthily for a few days.
Can you do that?
No problem.
I have to watch them stealthily
and find something I want to steal
Then I get the stealthy
desire to steal.
Are you really up to this?
You can trust me.
Once I have the stealthy
desire to steal...
It can only be completed if I steal
without the person's consent.
They have to hate
my stealing from them.
Can you do that for me?
promise to hate it.
I beg of you to do it.
Since I walk backwards
she can't follow me...
So she spends her time
talking to machines
with those dentures in.
She holds her hand out to doctors
and nurses to shake hands...
And she wants to very much
but then suddenly pulls away.
She loathes it so much
her hands tremble.
Why does she hold out her hand if
she dislikes shaking hands so much?
She hasn't done much,
why is she so exhausted?
Because she doesn't eat, no wonder.
Coffee.
Black.
Are you over your flickering now?
Lights, vending machine,
public phone, hiccup clock!
Have you seen my granny's dentures?
You can't understand me
without the dentures, can you?
Where are those dentures?
Young-goon doesn't eat her food.
Gop-dahn eats it.
Young-goon doesn't eat her food.
P.S. Gop-dahn eats it.
For today's gathering,
we're talking about
our most painful partings.
How about you Duk-chun?
Ready...
My most painful parting was?
My most painful parting was?
My most painful parting was?
Mother...
fucker!
How about me, doctor?
Sure! Ready?
My most painful parting was?
When I was 15 and my mom left home...
She took the entire family set
of electrical toothbrushes...
And left for good.
After that, I became a thief.
You damned thief!
Take your politeness back, mister.
Your walking backwards and
saying redundant things, all of it.
But why? I don't want to.
People can't follow me from behind!
Here. Transfer!
This news just in.
She was moved to a nearby hospital
but never woke from her coma
Granny is... critical?
In critical condition...
The white 'uns...
Granny... earring...
Oh... eating... radish...
They don't like it.
So...
They won't let me give
her the dentures.
My Granny... Ioves...
radish... so much...
I must... kill them... all.
Confounded bastards...
Please...
Steal...
My sympathy!
Stop crying!
Do you hate it?
No?
I told you that you must hate it!
I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!
I truly hate it!
I'm taking away your sympathy.
Alright, transfer!
When I count to five and
snap my fingers, open your eyes.
One, two, three, four.
Five.
No sympathy.
Young-goon!
Young-goon?
My battery...
Battery is...
Empty.
Young-goon!
Young-goon?
Young-goon?
Wang Gop-dahn!
Gop-dahn!
Tell me the truth
Did you really eat
Young-goon's food?
Beautiful Berne.
Where the clear stream flows.
How much more will
I have to practice...
to get into the Edelweiss
Boys' and Girls' Choir?
In my case, I have an elastic band
around my waist
I always feel reassured
even in strange places.
Stop, or our eyes will meet
and it will be scandalous.
Red alpine roses.
Blooming in the dew.
When my life reaches its end.
The elastic band will be
stretched to its limit
I've already been practicing for
31 years since I failed the audition.
Snap! And I'll just go back...
To where I started off originally.
Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan.
The beautiful mountains of Berne.
Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan,
Oh, my love Berne...
Do you think humans can
go against gravity?
Do you think...
humans can go...
against gravity?
I succeeded in my experiment!
Sleep flying!
Peppermint sherbet and
persimmon socks
They create static electrical tension.
And that makes the body float.
Like superconducting
magnetically levitated trains.
Watch. Here I go.
Should avoid eating things like
chicken right before flying.
Young-goon's always lying down
so I can't see her much these days
Can you see me, Sul-mi?
Partially, but...
Why don't you take it off?
What if I do and I'm invisible?
My mom and dad used to act like
I wasn't there,
even when I was.
That's why I'm good at stealing.
Because people can't see
me sometimes.
From the time I was 20,
I learned electrical wiring.
I made good money,
but I got caught stealing a motorcycle.
When I was being tried, the judge
said something only I could hear
Defendant Park Il-soon
will eventually vanish into a dot.
You shithead!
Oh dear!
I did all kinds of things in jail
Because I felt like I was vanishing.
I stole other people's
clothes to wear
And I brushed my teeth diligently.
Once your teeth start to go,
there's no turning back.
That's true.
I had a psych evaluation and...
They said I'm schizophrenic
and anti-social.
Anti-social?
Like stealing and fighting
for no reason.
And not having any sense of
guilt or sympathy.
But I don't know why
they call me anti-social.
I have my reasons for stealing.
I'm afraid I'll vanish.
I'm anti-vanishing.
They say there's no cure
for being anti-social.
But the doctor says to have hope.
Sometimes it goes away on its own
30 or 40 years later.
Though usually that 30-40 years
are spent in prison...
I see.
I admit myself here because
I don't want to go to prison.
Taxi!
When I feel it coming on,
I head straight back here.
This is my fifth hospitalization
in four years.
With steady labor, I can manage
the hospital and medication costs.
But do you think I can hold out
for 40 years like this?
Without vanishing into a dot?
What do you think?
Just...
Give up hope.
And...
Keep your strength up!
Strength?
But Young-goon has no strength!
I never thought you'd open up
about yourself like that.
Well, you're getting
shock therapy today.
Sul-mi?
People tend to think
that shock therapy is inhumane
But it isn't really, ma'am.
It's a widely used treatment for
depression or catatonia.
I see.
There are patients who don't eat.
