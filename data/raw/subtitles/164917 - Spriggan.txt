Hey!
This way!
Hey!
Oh, no!
Hey, are you ok?!
What's wrong?
Look!
It's...
What's happening?
This is a message plate.
It is a warning from a super-advanced
 civilization that came before us...
...whose scientific knowledge surpassed even
the most advanced technology of today.
One which perished as a result of it's
 own unchecked technological progress.
They said, "Return the art created in the
 infinite darkness to the darkness."
"Do so, and never awaken it again."
Based on this message, the organization
 known as Arcam was formed...
...to safeguard the technology of
 this advanced civilization.
The special agents that operate
 within it, are known as Spriggan.
Subtitled for the exclusive use of
 the Anime Club of Cape Cod!
This is "Fairy"...
"Red Group," reply.
 Repeat, reply.
Damn it.
I'm the only one left again.
So much for today.
Ominae...
If you keep falling asleep during class after
coming back from a long absence...
...you're going to end
 up our junior.
Really.
Yeah.
Wha, it's...
Huh?
Oh, Tanaka...
I heard he ran away from home, and his parents
 had to put in a missing person's report.
But he suddenly
 came back yesterday.
Did you want to ask me
 something, Tanaka?
You looked kind of pale.
Idiot, what're you doing?!
Help...me...!
STOP!!
Yu!
Ominae, are you alright?
Mr. Yamamoto, what is
 Noah all about?!
And what the hell is this
 supposed to be?!
"Yu Ominae, you are next."
Did you hear that 8 months ago, an entire Arcam
 research party was killed on Mt. Ararat in Turkey?
Yeah, I did happen
 to hear that.
Noah's ark was later
 discovered in that place.
Noah's ark?
Correct, as it was written through the 7th and 9th chapters of the book of Genesis in the Old Testament.
The humans that God made had
 grown to become incredibly evil.
God regretted his creation
 and decided to destroy man.
He allowed Noah, a man who's
 heart was right with God...
...to build an ark for his family and for
 two of every living animal on Earth.
What does any of that
 have to do with this?!
Let me finish the entire story.
Three weeks ago, a different research party was
 attacked by someone at another location.
That picture was taken after
 the attack at the ruins.
Three weeks ago?! Why didn't
 you tell me about this?!
Yu, it's obvious that
 they're targeting you.
That's too great
 of a risk for us.
Mr. Yamomoto, my friend
 was used as a human bomb!
Are you asking me to
 look away on this one?
For Arcam, Noah's ark
 is a very dangerous ruin.
I can't let you go there
 in the state you're in.
Besides, this mission is too much for
 the injuries that you've incurred.
For now, you get treatment
 for your body, and...
You must be joking!
A challenge has been
 directed straight at me!
I'll settle this myself!
Yu!
Here you go.
Thank you.
Concerning Noah's ark, Professor
 Mayzel is researching the spot.
Doc Mayzel is..?
This plane is now entering
 Turkish air space.
An unknown fighter of unknown origin
 has ordered us to change our course.
Our permission to land from at Devas airport
 from ground control has been cancelled.
We are now heading for Istanbul.
In Istanbul, agents from the Turkey
 branch of the Arcam Foundation...
...are working to make alternate
 travel arrangements.
Boy oh boy, what
 a tender welcome.
Did you come to
 fight a war?
Seize them!
I'm very sorry about that. We were
 supposed to have had an agreement.
Well, let's just take it easy.
By the way...
...did you make some agreement
 with the car back there?
Yes, of course...
That's because...
...they're my friends.
Your friends should be under the Bosporas
strait, packed in concrete about now...
I don't know where you're from...
...but it's way too early in the
 morning to be fighting.
From Japan, Spriggan,
Yu Ominae.
One of the special agents
 of the Arcam Foundation...
...which protects dangerous ruins of
 extremely ancient civilizations.
He has rare physical
 abilities and reflexes...
...and at the age of 17, his true potential
is number one in the organization.
His true potential really
isn't that much.
Ominae's cheap tricks won't
 have any effect on me.
That reminds me, I heard your unit
 was cruelly betrayed by him before.
Where is he now?
Unfortunately, we lost
 him after the attack.
No matter.
I know he'll be coming
here after all.
Arcam is just a
 private foundation...
I'll make this mountain his grave.
Right, Colonel Macdougal?
That's the mountain.
It's one of Arcam's.
Hey!
Damn!
Why are you so quick
 to start shooting?
How long are you going to
 walk me around like this?
Okay moronic spy,
 keep your mouth shut.
But it's like I've
 been telling you...
No one from Arcam
 dresses like that.
I couldn't help it!
Doc..!
Doc Mayzel!
Ms. Margaret is in
 on this too, eh?
Hey you, be quiet.
What are you doing?!
Are you alright?
Let me go!
What's this noise now?
It's me, Doc..! Me..!
Oh, it's Yu..!
What are you doing here?
I'm saved.
Do you know him, Doc?
Yes.
Yu Ominae, number
 one Spriggan.
It can't be...
Is he really?
Oh man.
Yu, I heard about your
 life being targeted.
Chief Yamamoto in Tokyo has
 been worried about you.
How hasty of you to run away from the
 hospital and to use Arcam's private jet.
Here.
It's the latest in armored
 muscle suits.
It's made partly of fibers of
 a metal called Omihalcon.
That battle suit was created by mixing metal Omihalcon fibers with an artificial muscle structure...
...that is resistant to both
heat and pressure.
It enables the user to draw more than 30
 times as much power as is normally used.
That reminds me, how long has it
 been since we've taken any vacation?
The last time we took one,
 was about two years ago.
This is a fighting knife also
 made of Omihalcon.
With a knuckle guard!
What's this?
Arm pad with wire anchor.
The length of the wire is about 50 meters,
 with a strong climbing claw.
Wow.
There's a heavy-duty motor inside, and
 it can lift up to two or three persons.
I can't believe you have to
 be armed with such things.
Emergency alert! An armed group of intruders
 have been spotted at excavation site one.
All defense units and medics
 are to report immediately!
So they've come.
I'm going to try these
 babies out right now.
What's going on?
Damn! He's a monster!
Run for it! Withdraw!
Why you..!
What happy people!
How dare you
 act so vulgar!
So you've come, Spriggan!
Yu Ominae..!
Bastard, you can't escape!
Fatman, I leave him to you!
Come back here!
Where are you going,
 you little traitor?
What?
You're still alive,
Major Fatman!
It's a pity Ominae..!
Did you lose your abilities
 when you joined Arcam?
How come? How come?
What's wrong with you?
Yes! Show me what you really can
 do, and what we trained you for!
Bastard!
Who the hell are you?!
My name is Jean.
Spriggan, Jean Jacquemonde.
Where is Mayzel?!
You want to pick on an old man?
I'm here.
I've got you.
My body became like
 this because of you.
Ominae!
Jean?
Don't move!
Though I sent that kid after you, brainwashing
 him with all the troubles of life...
...your abilities are still only this much.
I'm going to stop the source
 of your breathing now...
Ominae!
...with this machine body of mine!
You've finally shown
 your true colors!
That is ENOUGH!
He's already dead.
Both Little Boy and Fatman
 failed to obtain Mayzel.
They were just big talk.
It was predictable.
Well, that was all
 they could do.
But, Colonel, what if they
 continue to hold Noah?
Don't worry about that.
When our satellite probe
 was destroyed...
...the investigation into the magnetic field
 occurrence was quite significant.
This ancient stone manuscript we discovered in one of
 the ruins, along with the other message plate prove...
...that we are the ones who are
 holding the key to Noah.
What great confidence.
I will kill all who
 interfere with me.
All you people have to do is
 follow my orders, quietly.
You seem to be tired.
Who was he?
My former boss.
Ominae, what did you
 come here for?
Revenge?
You think they're the ones who
 made you like that, don't you?
Don't be so spoiled!
You were fascinated by the past,
 and forgot about the actual mission.
If you act like that, those who trust us, and entrust
 their lives to us will be exposed to danger.
Information from the satellite probe
 has revealed a shift in the magnetic field.
Mayzel's research has certainly been progressing,
 and it seems he's reached the heart.
There's no more time.
The situation is getting
 more and more difficult.
I think we need to take
 some kind of measures.
There is no need for that.
Macdougal will take care of it.
But General..!
I've been getting
 reports in, one by one.
Don't worry, because the consciousness
 of our nation has been instilled in his head.
So this is Noah's ark.
It's bigger than I thought.
According to the Old Testament, its length
 is 300 cubits, by a width is 50 cubits...
This is five times
 as big as that.
Actually, it's not made of any
 ordinary wooden material.
It's made of a strange substance, but we can't
 even put a scratch on it, let alone destroy it.
This is the entrance.
Can't you open it?
This is made of, so to speak,
 material that has no time.
What did you say?
Since this material has no stream of
 time to it, we can never destroy it.
It may not have even been
 created by human beings.
You're one of the American
 Machiner's Squad, aren't you?
Machiner's Squad?
Yeah.
It's a Cyborg unit
 under the Pentagon.
What's so funny?
He's coming, the man who
 has the Devil's own power.
What's that?
We have taken complete
 control of this base.
Please abandon your weapons
 and do as I tell you.
Who are you?
Bastard..!
What did you do to me..?
Yu!
You brat!
You'd better not, though it can't be
 helped if you want to die like him.
Idiot!
I'm not dead yet.
Wow! Still alive after
 taking that shock wave?
You have the life force
 of a cockroach.
I won't die from
 such a thing.
Cockroaches should
 crawl on the floor!
Stop playing around!
Let's protect Yu!
Stop it, you fools!
What good will it do for
 you to die needlessly?
Professor Mayzel,
and Ms. Margaret.
We finally meet I see.
"I am God of the sky."
"He who awakens me can freely make use
 of that which surrounds the Earth."
"When evil begins to spread
 across the world..."
"...turn the blessings of heaven
 to the curse of the Devil..."
"...and then create a
 new human race."
That's the message that was left
 on the stone manuscript we have.
Analyzing this with
 the Professors data...
The blessings from heaven are the ultraviolet
 rays of the sun which warm the Earth.
This system controls the gases which surround the planet, such as carbon-dioxide and the ozone layer.
Thus controlling the amount
 of ultraviolet penetration.
In other words...
Noah controls the
 atmosphere of the Earth.
What are you going
 to do with Noah?
What?
Why did you do that?!
That data belonged
 to our nation!
You two will go into
 Noah with me.
You can't say no, can you?
Not if you care about the
 lives of the people here.
Wait!
Your behavior goes against
 the will of the army's!
Go away.
Come along, doctor.
I see, so you're Macdougal.
Unbelievable, they put a magnetic
 field brain amplifer in your head.
Surely they realized such a device
 could kill you without warning.
Your lifespan is only a
 few years, isn't it?
You truly are great, Dr. Mayzel.
That's why the Pentagon tried
 so desperately to obtain you.
They justify every crime in
 the name of patriotism.
They endlessly repeated experiments
 on human bodies, until they created you.
That is why you are also a creature
 with the ugly ego of that nation.
That's old-fashioned
 sentimentalism.
I was not only chosen
 by my nation...
...but by God.
What did you say?
Serves you right, Spriggan!
Where did that brat go?!
Shoot him!
Shoot him to death!
That's far enough!
Such good intentions...
Hey! Don't you care what
 happens to your friend?!
Don't underestimate me!
It's resonating with him.
You had it.
I'll leave it to you from
 here on, Professor Mayzel.
Close the partitions,
 and seal off this block!
Bastard!
I think there is a meaning in the
 fact that the ark is in this area.
What was so special about the top of this mountain,
 that no other mountain around was suitable for?
If the legend of the first flood
 was caused by the ark...
...then the true power of the ark may be the
 ability to control the magnetic field.
This is it.
From here on, it is
 unknown territory.
We don't know
 what will happen.
Fine by me.
Well, let's go.
Die! Die!
Oh, no!
Damn!
Jean!
Are you ok, Jean?
Ominae...
...what did you do
 with that brat?
I heard he's headed
 for the ark.
Dr. Mayzel and his
 assistant are hostages.
That should be taken
 care of first.
Jean.
Go, quickly..!
Ominae!
Save those two
 by all means.
Take care of Jean!
How is it?
I see.
Hey!
The door is open.
The Doc..?
Probably inside the ark.
Why aren't you
 following them?
Well...
Look at that.
Light doesn't even
 penetrate it.
I've never seen or heard
 of such a thing.
This is the center of Noah.
This is Noah's control panel.
Professor, let's begin.
Are you alright?
Take care.
Professor.
The shield upon Noah
 is now undone.
Professor.
Yes.
It's..!
It's wonderful!
Today, while arms reductions are
 progressing over the world...
...the focus of our attentions
 is on environmental issues.
Acid rain, destruction of the
 ozone layer, global warming...
But with this "Noah's Ark," all of
 these problems can be solved.
Come out, Macdougal!
Our country must always be
 the leader of the free world.
So we wanted to obtain
 this by any means.
Why does the Pentagon
 have to have this?
If they use this, they could end up 
 destroying their own country.
What is your real
 purpose in all this?
Is it dead?
What's going on here?
Tracing back our history...
...the ice ages that wiped out the dinosaurs and other
 life forms were the result of Noah's power, too.
But, I think Noah has another function
 besides controlling the atmosphere.
But it was so eccentric, that no
 one would believe such a fact.
That just maybe the countless dinosaurs and
 other strange animals in stasis outside in the ark...
...were probably used in experiments for creating the
 life forms that would carry on the next generation.
What are these things?
What I mean is, Noah's other function
 is that of a life-creating device.
What do you think, Professor?
 Isn't it incredible?
The history of the human race was
 created within this "Noah's ark!"
Come now, let us build a
 new world with our hands.
Worthless.
That is your wish.
Mankind has progressed
 in the wrong way.
Man is the only defective
 work that God created.
Are you trying to put Man
 on trial in place of God?
We must do it now.
I want the two of you to create new life
 forms for the next generation using Noah.
That's the reason I brought
 you in, Professor.
Come...
...let's do it.
No.
Damn! Where the hell are
 the Doc and the others?
What did you just say?
I said no.
You're insane.
I see.
Then it can't be helped.
What are you going to do?
Get a fire extinguisher..! Quickly!
Run!
Run! An earthquake!
No! Look!
The ark has started to move!
What's all this shaking?
That brat is moving the ark!
I've activated Noah's
 global warming mode.
Ice from the North and South
 Pole will begin to melt.
And seawater that is warmed will cause abnormal
 weather conditions and swallow most of the land.
So, what will you do, Professor?
You can't turn back now.
This is the beginning of
 the second flood legend.
So cockroach...
...you're still alive!
If I can't do it from the outside,
 I'll destroy it from the inside.
Under these circumstances, I'll take
 this ark down with that brat.
Professor!
That's it!
That bastard!
That will be enough!
Silence!
Professor!
So there you are.
I'm taking the Doc and
 Ms. Margaret back.
Yu, there's no other way out,
 other than the door into Noah.
Doc, hurry and go!
The plate...
I won't let you go!
I gave the Professor the one
 chance to co-exist with God.
I'm your only enemy here.
Let's fight our way to
 the pits of Hell.
Entering this holy place with your shoes on,
 haven't you learned your lesson?
Why don't you stop
 playing with fire, brat!
Looks like you want
 a double suicide.
But you're going to make
 your trip to Hell alone.
Don't make me laugh.
Who could be beaten
 by a brat like you?
Don't you get it yet?
That armored suit is as good
 as a toy in front of me.
Why don't you stop profaning God's
 temple with your blood already?
God's temple?
Where is God in this room?
Noah, and the one who
 wields it is God.
Which part of this extermination
 equipment is God?!
As it has been since ancient times, the power
 that is given, is only given to the chosen one.
A person like you has no
 right to be on this ark.
You're just another person
 who's being used!
You're just an expendable item to your
 government! Don't you see that?!
My plans no longer have anything to do with
 the Pentagon or the Machiner's Squad.
I'll judge these rotten human
 beings with my own hands.
You've gotta be kidding!
Stay back!
You bastard..!
He's dead.
Project name... "Cosmos."
The Pentagon's special experimental unit in
 which elite killers are trained since childhood.
I'm talking about the organization
 you used to belong to, Number 43.
Don't call me by a number.
I am, Yu Ominae....
I've heard the rumor...
...that you alone betrayed the
 organization, didn't you?
Stop, Number 43!
Put down that gun.
Good, that's it.
What's wrong, Number 43?!
I am, Yu Ominae!
You are nothing more
 than a killing machine.
I'm...
You've seen the death of your parents
 on the people you've killed.
Such a thing must have
 drove you mad.
I am not a machine.
I am a human being.
I won't be a tool for murder,
 even if I must die.
A human?
Do you think a mere human can
 possibly fight against me, God?
You make me laugh.
Where on earth is a God
 who was made by humans?
Noah began to behave rashly, when
 it began resonating with your power.
What do you think you can do
 with that body full of junk?
I am God!
I will kill all of Man!
Before that though,
 you will already be dead!
Idiot.
Damn it!
A little more, just a little more... and my
 nightmare's would have been washed away!
A brats fairy tale dream...
...is over.
What are you doing?
I said that I wasn't going
 to be a tool for murder.
Noah's self-destruct sequence
 has just been activated.
What?
Now the inside of the ark, which
 was in different dimensional space...
...will be swallowed up by
 three-dimensional space.
Bastard!
We've discovered many magnetic
 fields similar to Noah's.
Ruins with artifacts that have this
 kind of power are all over the world.
The real battle has
 just begun, Spriggan!
What's that?
Look! The ark!
Damn...
It's over.
Wake up...
...Ominae!
Geez, don't go sleeping
 in such a place, you jerk.
Jean.
What?
Just like you said, I'm
 way too easy going.
I can still see that brat's
 dying face in my mind.
Yeah, you are too easy going,
 but that's what I like about you.
What did you say?
Just shut up hang on.
What's that?!
That is the true
 figure of the ark.
The ark is breaking up!
It can't be!
We couldn't even
 scratch the thing!
Something must have been
 activated to have caused this!
Four thousand
 years of time...
...has been destroyed, and
 returned to the void.
But, what about
 Yu and Jean?
Hey, look.
Yu!
You're alive!
