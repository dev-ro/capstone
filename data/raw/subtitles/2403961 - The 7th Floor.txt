It's morning in Buenos Aires.
It's a 64 degrees
in the city center.
Clear skies and 82% humidity.
A sunny morning, but...
fire in a warehouse.
A fire was reported this morning
in the district of Almagro,
police sources reveal.
The fire broke out a
little after 5 a.m.
Firefighters are on the scene
battling to contain the blaze
as police are sealing the area.
Report made public by
the Dept. of the Interior
on the increase of
crime in Buenos Aires.
In the last quarter
robberies with violence
and home and business
invasions have risen.
Now let's go to the traffic.
All routes into the
capital are congested,
General Paz at Libertador,
crossing Rio de la Plata...
SEVENTH
Go ahead.
Sebas, Goldstein wants you at the
door to the Court in an hour.
He's crazy, the hearing's at 11.
Apparently Ferruti's going ape-shit
and wants to go over strategy,
he has a couple of ideas.
I'm the ideas man, I'm the lawyer.
But he's the money man.
Goldstein said so, not me.
What else did he say?
If the Ferruti thing works out,
you'll score a Christmas bonus.
- You always out to the chase.
- It's my job.
In that case, do you
have any plans tonight?
Don't start.
What's wrong? You're
single, pretty, young,
I'm a free man now...
It's a perfect combination.
Sebas...
Divorced men are the worst,
all you think about is sex.
Sure. Is there anything else?
Cut it out. At the door to
the Court in an hour. Ciao.
- Hey, sis'. What's up?
- Hello? Sebastián?
Gabriela.
- Are you there?
- Hello?
Sebas?
Alberto just called me.
He says if I don't go
back to him I've had it.
- No. Again?
- He's stalking me.
I can't believe it.
I don't know what to do.
I'm soared. What do I do?
Ignore him, he's a dick.
Look,
record him next time and we'll
hit him with harassment.
We'll see who comes off worse.
What's that supposed to me?
- What if he comes here?
- Gabi, you're breaking up.
I'm kind of in a rush.
- I'm scared, Sebastián.
- Calm down, calm down.
I'll call you in a while. Ciao.
Bostero! We'll score
4 goals this Sunday.
Tell the old lady on the 6th:
next time she leaves her car
there I'm calling the tow truck.
She's old, and her eyes are going.
She should sell that car already.
Take the bus.
If you beat us by 4,
you can get my car.
- Otherwise I get your Harley forever.
- No way.
- Have a good day.
- Thanks. You too.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Yes?
- Where are you, Rubio?
Just getting to Court.
I'm so late, and I still have to take the
kids to school. Stall Ferruti, please.
Do I read him a story?
Sing him a bolero, whatever,
but he talks to no one.
Piñeiro is doing the talking.
He has a press conference at 11.
He knows what's coming.
Do you think so?
Maybe it's not related.
Shithead.
- What?
- Nothing.
See you in a while. If
anything happens, call me.
Doesn't the buzzer work?
I didn't hear it.
Sorry, I forgot. I'm in a hurry.
Right.
The kids?
Brushing their teeth.
What a fright!
You scared me to death!
- Did you bring my rollerblades?
- Of course. C'mon, we're late.
We're always late with you.
- Come home and we'll never be late.
- Brush your teeth, let's go.
- Can I take my PSP to school?
- Don't even think about it.
I'll be outside.
Lawyers for meat
tycoon Ernesto Ferruti
may have out a deal for
his testimony against
his ex-partner, now a
congressman, Santiago Piñeiro.
How the hell did they find out?
I don't know how you can
deal with these people.
Not again, Delia. They're clients.
They're criminals.
Even they have the right
to legal representation.
Yeah, sure.
You look nice. Are you going out?
I'm going to work. That's life.
Anyway, if some night you
want to go out for a drink,
and you need me to take care
of the kids, it's no problem.
My lawyer and notary did the papers.
It just needs your signature.
Sebastián, please,
it's been months, I can't take it.
I need to go back to Spain.
You know the kids love it.
They'll be better there.
They'll be better far
away from their dad?
You know my dad's ill and
needs me by his side.
Like I say,
your rich brothers are there,
they can hire a nurse.
- A nurse?
- Yes.
After all my father
did for you in Spain.
A good job, a good salary...
He also reminded me about
it all the time, didn't he?
Give Luca the phone.
And don't forget to give the
pill to Luna's teacher.
- I never forget.
- Then don't today either.
I put it all in her bag.
Luna, the authorization for
the excursion is in your bag.
Where's the most beautiful
thing in my life?
None of that game on the stairs.
They'll fall one day.
Oh, God, hurry up, you'll
be late for school.
- See you later.
- See you later.
Traitors, both of you.
Both of you.
So you tell Mom our secrets
in exchange for stickers?
Yes.
The cell phone is for
emergencies only.
No calling to say you're bored,
you're taking a leak, got it?
And the pill... Hold on.
Elevator!
Don't you want to know
one of Mom's secrets?
- Mom's got secrets?
- Lots.
- I have no stickers.
- If you let us play the stair game...
You heard your mother.
No running on the stairs.
But Dad, we're big now.
We'll beat you today.
If you tell me Mom's secret,
I'll let you take the stairs.
We'll tell you downstairs.
Please, be careful!
Do you hear me?
Go! Run, go!
I'm totally gonna own you today!
Not so fast or you'll fall.
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.
YOU'LL HAVE IT.
Dickhead.
Morning.
I win!
I made it!
Let's go!
Guys! Get down here, I'm late.
Come on, come down, I'll be late.
Guys!
I'm going up. If you
see them, stop them.
Where are you?
Let's go!
I'm late!
Luna! Luca!
- Hello.
- Morning.
Guys!
Let's go!
The number you have dialed...
Let's go!
Guys!
Luca! Luna!
Did you see them?
- They didn't go this way.
- Where the hell...?
Maybe they're with a
neighbor, with Natalia.
- Were you here the whole time?
- All the time.
Maybe you stepped out for a
minute and didn't see them go by.
Can you turn that down?
Guys!
I'll be right back.
Who is it?
- Natalia, it's Sebastián.
- What is it, Sebas?
Are my kids there with you?
Here? No. I haven't
seen them since Monday.
Alright, sorry.
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing, don't worry.
Guys?
Sorry. Have you seen Luca and
Luna from the 7th? My kids.
We haven't seen anyone.
- Out you get.
- Sorry. Thanks.
The number you have dialed is...
Guys!
Joke's over!
I'm starting to get mad, eh?
I'm starting to get mad.
Guys!
Guys!
Come on!
Where are you?
Guys!
Luca!
Come on, guys!
Please, I'm in a hurry!
The number you have
dialed is turned off or...
- What's going on, Rubio?
- We're waiting for you.
Ferruti saw the news
and he's freaking out.
- I'll be there in half an hour.
- Half an hour?
I can't go now, I'll explain later.
Sebas, this thing's going off
the rails. Ferruti's backing down.
Seriously, I can't come now.
Cover for me, please.
What the hell do I do?
Try to convince him
that everything's fine,
that this is all a stunt
by Piñeiro's lawyers.
- Please, Sebastián...
- I just need half an hour.
- Stay here, you can tell him.
- Yes, of course.
- Sebastián.
- What's happened?
Maria from the 6th saw them go by.
I was about to leave my
apartment and they ran past.
I told them to be
careful or they'd fall.
That's all you heard? Did
they stop to talk to someone?
No, I went inside to answer
the phone. That's all I know.
- Maybe something happened to them.
- Not in here, it's impossible.
This is completely crazy. How
can they suddenly vanish?
We can talk to the inspector on
the 3rd, he hasn't left yet.
Let's go.
- Can you wait a minute?
- Yes.
You talk to him. We
had a silly argument
on the residents committee
about the accounts.
Who is it?
Good morning. It's
Miguel, the concierge.
Coming.
- Morning, Rosales. Sorry...
- Yes?
- This is Sebastián, from the 7th.
- Yes, we know each other.
- Morning.
- It turns out that his children...
They were going down the
stairs, a silly game, and...
I don't understand what
happened, but they disappeared.
I can't find them. I've
searched the whole building
and I can't find them.
- They probably went to school.
- No, they never go alone.
Maybe they're upset
about something.
No, they're not.
You never know what's
going on in kids' heads.
My kids wouldn't just wander off.
Did you call the school?
Maybe they went alone,
and if they're not at
school, wait downstairs.
They might be playing hide and seek.
When they get bored they'll turn up.
Excuse me.
Okay, see you.
Yes, Luca and Luna Roberti.
Luca's in 4th year
and Luna's in 2nd.
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.
Have they seen them?
- Hello?
- Yes, I'm listening.
They're not here,
they haven't arrived.
Please, if they appear,
will you tell them to call me?
- Yes, of course.
- Thanks, you're very kind.
- Have they turned up?
- No.
- Did you call the school?
- Yes.
Class started half an hour
ago, but they're not there.
- They didn't go out this way?
- I didn't see them.
They didn't, or you didn't
see them, you imbecile?
No, I was here all the time.
I would've seen them
go out this way.
What are other
possible explanations?
They may be in the building,
but we can't rule out that they left.
I'll tell the station
to advise all units.
Excuse me.
Hello, Gómez, it's me.
INCOMING CALL: DELIA
I can't stand around,
I have to find them.
Good morning. Sorry.
I live on the 7th.
My kids took the stairs,
and now I can't find them.
- What is it?
- He's looking for the kids on the 7th.
- No idea.
- We just woke up.
Sorry.
- If you see them...
- Yes, we'll let you know.
- Thank you.
- Ciao.
Two of them.
In school clothes, with their bags.
I haven't seen them.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
No?
Thank you.
My two kids took the stairs...
- No.
- Thank you.
Sebastián!
Sebastián!
Come over here for a sec!
Come on.
Come on!
- What? Have you found them?
- No, no.
I have to go to work, but the police
are coming by to watch the entrance.
How are you set for money?
Sometimes they're held for a few hours
and released for 80 or 100,000 pesos.
- They must be in the building.
- We don't know that.
Maybe they were taken
out through the garage.
Here, this is my card.
I'll be at the station
checking out the residents:
priors, criminal records...
Listen. Don't talk to anyone.
Keep off your phone,
and if they call you,
call me, got it?
Got it.
I have to make one call.
Delia, their mother.
Good luck.
Delia?
I called you a while ago
and you out me off.
I couldn't talk.
Did you remember Luna's pill?
I have to tell you something.
I'm closing a sale.
Tell me later, okay?
It's important, Delia. The kids...
What about them?
They took the stairs
and when I got down...
I don't know what
happened, I don't get it.
I can't find them, I don't
know where they are.
What are you saying?
I spoke to the cop
on the 3rd, Rosales.
He thinks they were kidnapped.
What is this? If it's a
joke, it's not funny!
I'm serious, Delia.
The kids have disappeared.
This can't be true.
Yes, these things happen,
but it'll be sorted out.
Cut the crap. Where are
they? What's going on?
I'm doing all I can, I swear.
I'll find them, I promise you.
Unbelievable.
This can't be happening.
- On the 5th. The Bear.
- Yes.
He took the elevator with me.
He didn't open up when
I knocked, but he's inside.
- The Bear, you think?
- He's there.
He's an asshole. Always whining about
the kids: noise, any old crap.
Open up, we know you're in there.
Open up!
- What's wrong?
- Where are my kids?
- I don't know.
- You don't?
- Motherfucker!
- Stop!
Guys?
You're crazy!
What are you doing?
- Luna!
- They're not here!
Luca!
Guys!
You can't burst into my home!
- Where are my children?
- I don't know.
- You don't? Where are they?
- I don't know anything, I swear.
I don't know anything.
Sebastián, he doesn't have them.
Goldstein.
Where are you?
Ferruti is going crazy.
- No, I...
- The hearing! about to start.
If you're not there, it'll
be postponed and we can't...
This is an emergency,
but I'm coming.
I'll be half an hour.
I've got a lot riding on this case.
Don't screw it up.
I'm coming. Tell the judge
I'll be half an hour.
Okay, half an hour, or
you're history, you hear me?
"Looking for them"?
The kids were with him!
- Where's Sebastián?
- There.
We're looking everywhere.
Where are they?
Where are my kids?
How could they disappear?
- Let me explain.
- How could you lose my children?
- Where are my children?
- Calm down. Let me explain.
Listen, the police already
have all the details.
They're talking kidnapping,
we have to wait.
Weren't you with them?
Where were you?
They took the stairs,
I took the elevator.
I told you!
We've done it tons of times.
They'll turn up.
We'll find them, I swear.
Please, let them not be hurt.
Don't let them hurt my children.
Let's look for them,
we can't stand idly by.
Yes, I called them,
and there's no answer,
I asked the neighbors,
knocked on all the doors,
nobody saw anything,
nobody knows anything.
Natalia.
Natalia's obsessed with them.
- Delia...
- Yes, that woman's weird.
She'd never do anything
to them. Think.
She'd do anything to
look after them again.
- She'd do anything.
- Delia, please, think.
- They can't find them.
- They'll be in the building.
- Take it easy.
- Okay.
- Sebas, where are the children?
- I don't know, Natalia.
- They've disappeared.
- How?
- Where are my children?
- I don't know, Delia.
Luna! Luca!
Luna, honey!
Luca, my love!
Luna!
Where are you? Luca!
Where are you?
- I'm sorry.
- How could you...?
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
- Where are the children?
- What?
You know that sooner or later
I'm taking them to Spain.
I'm the one who looks after them.
The judges will give me custody.
Do you realize what you're saying?
You've lied to me your whole life
and you deal with criminals.
I'd never put our kids at risk.
I've told you a lot of lies,
but I would never... I have
nothing to do with this.
I adore them and want them to be
with me, but you're their mother.
I'd never dream of
keeping them from you.
Goldstein.
Why the hell aren't you here?
It's all about to turn to shit.
My kids have disappeared.
- What are you talking about?
- They've been kidnapped.
Right now I don't give a shit about
work, Ferruti or the hearing.
I need to find my children
and I need this line open.
Sorry.
Sebastián!
It came in your name, no sender.
Maybe it's important.
I'm calling Rosales to see
if he's found out anything.
News on the Ferruti case.
Sources close to the Prosecutor
say that today's hearing
may be postponed...
It's a trap.
It's a trap.
If I'm not at Court today,
the case gets dismissed.
If Ferruti doesn't testify,
Piñeiro buys time.
They'll pressure
people not to testify.
I don't get it.
They kidnapped them to keep
me away from the Court,
to blow the hearing.
- So what do we do?
- Tell them they've won.
Hernández.
Where are you?
You're causing chaos here.
- You know why I'm not there.
- What are you talking about?
I'm not coming, so
you can let them go.
Tell Piñeiro he's won.
I'm dropping the case.
After this, Ferruti's bound
to back down and clam up.
- You won. Congratulations.
- I don't know what you mean.
You kidnapped my kids.
Don't act dumb, you fuck!
I know it was you!
Your kids were kidnapped?
You're not going to show up?
I only wish we had thought of it.
Look, I don't know who did it,
but when you find out, tell
me so I can congratulate him.
Roberti?
What happened?
Who is it?
Gabriela.
Rosales.
- Did you find them?
- No, but we have something.
Pascal Marteau. He had
trouble in France. Kids.
- No, not that.
- The French guy, 2C.
Let's go.
Miguel, bring up the key to 2C.
- We can't without a warrant.
- Fuck that.
It's regulations.
- We do worse than that every day.
- What are you insinuating?
- You know.
- No, I don't. Why don't you tell me?
- I'm a lawyer, I know how it works.
- Sebastián, please...
Fine, maybe you're the only
decent cop left in Buenos Aires,
but I need this door open now.
They're our children.
Here it is.
Go on, I take full responsibility.
Go ahead.
Guys?
Luna!
Luca!
Guys?
Luna?
Luca?
I haven't seen him for days.
We have to search the
other apartments.
- We've looked everywhere.
- No, we haven't.
Not the vacant ones or
people out of town.
Get the key, we'll
search the others.
The kids aren't here.
You should wait at home.
They're bound to call you soon.
They're playing you
to get more money.
Motherfuckers!
Sebastián, calm down.
The hell I will!
Let's go.
What if it's not for money?
What if they want to hurt them?
I don't want to hear that.
My head's exploding.
I can't take any more.
Let's calm down. Panic won't
solve anything, okay?
Let's be strong.
Okay?
Let's be strong, okay?
The guy seemed suspicious.
Let's go home.
They shouldn't be here.
I knew it. The man's on a trip,
apparently he sells perfume.
I just talked to HQ.
Every patrol car in the area
is looking for your children.
And they're stopping and
questioning any possible suspect.
They'll turn up.
Did you tell the Prosecutor?
Don't worry about that.
It's being handled.
You'd better go home.
It's rough, but it's the
only thing you can do.
- Go on up.
- What about you?
I'll take a last look at
the garage with Miguel.
- I'll go with you.
- No, go home in case they call.
Luca?
Luna?
They're not in the building.
I don't know how, but they got out.
Sure you know how.
The show's over.
What was the deal, you fuck?
You did a nice job
on me, the works.
The elevator stops to stall me,
you take me to the cop, he tells
me not to talk to anyone,
you invent some suspicious
French guy I've never seen.
Please, tell me where
you've got my kids.
Tell me, I'm begging you.
I've got nothing to do with this.
Don't act dumb or I'll
bust you, you fuck!
- Let go, man.
- I'll bust you!
I didn't do anything! I've
been with you from the start!
I watched them grow up.
Really, man!
- Hello.
- Rubio?
Is it true about your kids?
- Listen, I need a favor.
- Where are you?
Is your guy still with the
Feds, or was he kicked off?
- Who? Cucho?
- Yeah, him.
He's still in. I saw him recently.
What do you want?
- I need info on someone.
- Okay. Who?
An inspector, name of Rosales.
He's in the 25th.
- Who is he?
- A neighbor. He maybe involved.
Okay, I'll call Cucho now.
Don't worry. Anything else?
- No. Thanks, Rubio.
- Okay. Ciao.
It's all my fault.
Since I got to Buenos Aires,
all I've thought about is work,
moving up and making money.
Then that thing with Marcela...
That thing?
A year cheating on me
with my best friend.
I was an asshole.
Do you remember how we met?
Of course I do.
- What a fuss you kicked up.
- What was I going to do?
I went broke in Buenos Aires,
and soon as I got to Madrid
I got mugged. My wallet was
stolen. I couldn't believe it.
You were out of your mind:
"fucking" this,
"motherfucker" that...
Good thing you took me out for a drink
or who knows what I would've done.
A lot more than one.
What?
Gabriela.
- What is it?
- Why won't you pick up?
- Gabi, listen...
- Alberto was here.
- What?
- He tried to open the door.
Gabi, listen. The kids
have been abducted.
What? What happened?
I've heard nothing for hours.
I have to keep the line open.
When all this is over I'll
come over, I promise.
Sebastián, wait.
What if it's his doing?
He's crazy, he tried
to break the door down.
He's told me a thousand
times that you'd get yours.
I got a message from him
this morning threatening me.
- So it must be him.
- What is it?
Gabriela's ex has it in for me.
He thinks I convinced
her to divorce him.
Where are you?
We should get together.
- No, stay at home, don't move.
- Sebastián, wait.
I'll send someone over.
I'll call you later. Ciao.
Tell Rosales.
What's wrong?
Alberto's too dumb to set
up something like this.
He could trash my car, hit
me, but kidnap the kids...
It's a possibility. Tell Rosales.
- I don't like Rosales.
- Let them look into it.
There's always a cop mixed
up in this kind of thing.
- Who is it?
- Rubio.
Go ahead.
He's in deep shit over some car
accident. He ran over some fool
and the Feds can't cover for him.
There's 50,000 dollars at stake.
- That's over a year's salary.
- Yes, it's twice.
- I can be there in 20 minutes.
- No, I need something else.
- Send someone to my sister's.
- What's up with her?
- Her ex is out of control.
- Again?
- Okay, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Rubio.
It's Rosales.
Are you sure?
Wait here for me.
I'm sorry.
You know you could
do time for this?
Where are my kids?
Tell me what you need to
sort out this shit of yours.
I know it's rough on you,
but you have to take it easy.
Alright, you drove me crazy.
Tell me how much you want.
You've got me wrong.
I'm not involved.
Give me a kidnapping
without a cop in on it.
If there is, it's not me.
- How much do you want?
- Cut it out.
- How much?
- That's enough!
Take it easy.
I'm just trying to
help you, dumb-ass.
Sebastián! Sebastián!
Sebastián!
What is it?
They called.
I was in the kids' room. When
I answered, they hung up.
Listen, the kids are fine.
Do everything we say and
you'll get them back.
Otherwise you'll never
see them again.
We'll call in a while.
- Hello.
- Are you their father?
- Yes. Are my kids okay?
- They're fine.
Please don't hurt them.
If you do as we say, nothing
will happen to them.
We'll do everything you say.
You have 2 hours to
get 100,000 dollars.
2 hours? 100,000 dollars?
- Don't interrupt me.
- Sorry, sorry.
- What's your cell phone number?
- 1559327525.
We'll call in a while to tell
you where to drop the money.
If we spot one cop you'll
never see your kids again.
Yes, yes.
2 hours, 100,000.
How do we get 100,000
dollars in 2 hours?
Your old man.
He has the dough and
they're his grandchildren.
- What?
- It's night-time in Madrid.
The banks are closed.
There must be another way,
a relative, a friend, someone.
In 2 hours?
- We can intervene.
- No, no.
We can't run any risks.
No cops, thanks.
Fine, I'll be down the station.
- Keep me informed.
- Alright.
- It's a lot of money.
- Yes.
- Wait here.
- Where are you going?
I'm going to get the money.
- Be careful.
- Relax, it'll all be okay.
Rubio.
I sent a guard to your sister's.
Any news on the kids?
Yes. They called. They
want 100,000 dollars.
They gave me 2 hours to
get it, so I need your help.
I don't have that kind of money.
I know, but Goldstein does.
I'm going to hit him up for a loan.
Goldstein's tough.
They're my kids, Rubio.
Help me soften him up, please.
- Right, see you at his office.
- Right, see you there.
Fucking hell.
Taxi!
Stop!
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?
- Where to?
- 25 de Mayo and Lavalle, please.
What route, boss?
Whichever's fastest.
Here.
Come on, man!
- What's wrong?
- Some jerk blocking the street.
Fucking traffic jams!
Just punch it!
How are you?
I feel like shit.
Let's go.
After today, he's got your
balls in a vise, so go easy.
What did Ferruti say?
He told us to piss off. He
says he wants a real lawyer.
Let's take the stairs.
- Sebas, how are you?
- Goldstein?
Inside, but...
- Counselor...
- What are you doing here?
I'll call you right back.
Because of you we've lost
one of our best clients.
They've kidnapped my children.
- They want 100,000.
- 100,000 US dollars.
I need the money, I'm begging you.
I only have one hour left.
You don't believe me?
I don't believe anyone anymore.
And you don't piss holy water.
They're my kids. Please.
I'll pay you back!
- I don't have that kind of cash.
- Yes, you do.
I know you do.
The union takings.
They give you 100,000 every week
and you don't trust banks anymore.
How the hell do you know?
I know if you don't give it to me,
it'll be all over tomorrow's news.
Imagine the stink: the Court,
the union, this practice,
all covered in shit.
How about that?
You're playing with fire.
This is about my children
and time's running out.
I have no choice, you decide.
You come back from Spain broke,
I open this practice up to you,
you shit on the case of the year,
and still you threaten me.
You're wasting my time.
Get out. Both of you.
Learn some manners.
Olga, call security.
- Open the safe or I'll blow your head!
- Stop! Stop!
I'll smash your head in!
Open it up!
- Stop. Let me go.
- Now!
Open it up!
Stop.
Stop.
Alright!
Sebastián.
You'll end up in jail.
- Where's your car?
- In the car park.
- Lend it to me.
- You're in no state to drive.
No, if they see you, we're fucked.
I'll call you.
- Hello.
- It's me.
I've got all the money.
Where do I take it?
Go to the docks, the esplanade.
Know where it is?
Yeah.
Leave the cash on the yellow
pillar. Someone will get it.
Alright... Wait!
I need to speak to my kids. I want
to know they're alright, or...
Please.
Hold on a moment.
Hi, Dad.
Hello, my girl.
- Are you alright?
- Yes.
Is Luca alright? How are you both?
We're fine. When are you coming?
Right away, don't worry.
I'll be with you very soon.
- Now keep your end up.
- Yes.
It's all here.
- Hello.
- That's that.
I left the money where you said.
Some kid just took it.
Perfect, that's it.
And my children?
The kids will be waiting...
No, no, no!
No, please, no! Fucking hell!
No!
- Have the kids turned up?
- It's all the same here.
Sebastián!
They turned up!
You were right, they
were in 4A all the time.
Your lady's taken
them to your place.
Stop fucking around. Go!
God!
Dad!
Don't cry, Dad.
We're fine.
It's so lucky...
you...
So lucky.
Her bags from the
store ripped open.
There was food and stuff
all over the floor.
- And you helped her?
- Yes.
- Did you know her?
- No.
Yes.
- Her face was familiar.
- She said she was your friend.
- A friend of mine?
- She was very friendly.
She gave us cookies!
She had a Wii, we showed
her how to use it.
- At any time did...
- Okay.
Guys, you've been good,
really, really good.
But next time, don't
talk to strangers.
- That's a promise.
- Yeah?
Alright, go have lunch.
- She took good care of us.
- She treated you well?
Good, then that's that.
Relax and have a nice lunch,
you've had enough for one day.
Eat up, alright?
Dad...
We didn't tell you the secret.
Sure, I forgot about that.
What's the secret?
You're the best dad in the world.
Eat up.
What are we going to do?
I mean us.
We could start over, couldn't we?
From scratch.
I know I was an asshole
and I threw it all away.
But I need you to
forgive me, Delia.
Please.
We were the perfect couple.
We could be again.
I just checked with the airlines.
There's a plane leaving at midnight.
There are still some tickets.
I don't want the kids to
spend one more minute here,
not after what just happened.
They'll be happy in Spain and
they won't want for anything.
You can come see them
whenever you want.
We'll talk about "us" later,
the kids are the main thing now.
Yes, of course.
Give me the papers.
Give them to me.
Why don't you come with us, Dad?
We want you to come with us.
I am coming,
but I have a bunch of
stuff to sort out here.
I'm coming.
I promise.
Come on, let's go.
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?
It's better this way.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
My bad.
Have the police finished?
Mr. Rosales said it was all over
and I could clean up in here.
- Excuse me, I need a broom.
- Yes, of course.
- Aren't going to answer it?
- Not at this hour.
Here we are.
- To Madrid?
- Yes, it's here.
- Sebas?
- Hello. Rubio?
Did they appear?
- The kids are fine. Listen.
- What's going on?
- Get me a contact at the airport.
- At Ezeiza?
Yes, Customs, the Feds,
Immigration, whatever.
- Okay, I'm on it.
- It's an emergency.
- But why? What's happening?
- I'll explain later.
Thanks, Rubio. Ciao.
AIRPORT POLICE, HERMAN CAPDEVILA
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Papers, please.
- How many bags are you checking in?
- One.
- Fine, have a good flight.
- Thank you.
That way.
Luna, I can't take
any more. Hold on.
Tired, aren't you?
It's Dad!
Dad!
Guys!
Luna! Luca! Wait!
- Dad!
- Luna!
Luca, be careful!
Be careful! You'll fall!
Daddy!
Are you coming with us?
No, there's been a change of plan.
Mom has to go, but
you have to stay.
Why? What happened?
There was a problem
with your passports.
You can't travel at the moment.
That's it, it's over.
- I'm not going without them.
- Yes, you are.
The children are coming with me.
You're boarding that plane alone or
I will tell them the whole truth.
I'm giving you a way out.
Think about it, you
committed a crime.
One call and you're in jail.
I don't care.
You don't care if your kids
see you in jail either?
You couldn't do that.
Now, put on a smile.
Show them your best smile.
Guys, a kiss for Mom,
she has to go.
Mommy!
Why don't you stay?
And Granddad, who'll take
care of him, my love?
I don't want you to go.
We'll see each other
very soon, honey.
Well...
You're what I love most in
the world, you know that?
Ciao.
We'll miss you.
Ciao, Mom. Come back soon.
It's okay, Mom's going to be fine.
Besides, we'll see her soon.
Now let's get going. Ready?
How about a midnight snack?
Or do you want to sleep?
How about a little PlayStation?
I don't even have the
strength to turn on the TV.
I'll play you at FIFA.
- A Spain-Argentina game?
- Yes.
You're on! As soon as we get home.
