Down there?
Dad?
Harriet priestly
Just called your mama.
Her husband
Drove by the store
And said the lights
Were still on.
What are the lights
Still doing on?
I'm cookin' the books
As usual, dad.
The sign, guy.
The sign is still on.
Are we open for business
All night now?
No. Sorry. I, uh,
I'll turn that right off.
Is that music playing on one
Of the store hi-fis?
I'll turn that
Right off, too.
"Turn that off, too."
Dang.
Ohh.
But I thought you
Already decided on the echoes.
Nah. Some band
In buffalo's the echoes.
Anyway, I wasn't
Wild about that.
Let's just...
Call us the...band
You're about to hear.
How 'bout
The corvettes?
Is that the corvettes
Or the chordvettes?
No. Corvettes,
Like the car.
Well, see, I was thinkin',
Like, the chord...
Chordvettes.
Like chords in our music.
No.
here you are.
That's 10 cents.
Is that
Skitch patterson?
- hi.
- hey there.
Mornin', everybody.
Mornin'.
Hey, guy.
Well, here we are.
Erie's lone beatnik.
Any others?
What about the tempos?
You know, tempos?
Not the tempos.
Tempos...
I was in a band already
Called the tempos.
We were...
Terrible.
Hey, guy, weren't
You the drummer in the tempos?
Heard that.
I keep comin' back
To the herdsmen.
How 'bout
The big tippers?
I like it.
Ok, skitch.
You wanna experience
Shame tonight?
We're playin' the mercyhurst
College talent show.
It's gonna be
Hilarious.
Jimmy and the herdsmen.
Chad gonna solo
On wipeout?
Oh, you know, every song
Is wipeout to chad.
Enjoy your breakfast.
See ya, faye.
I gotta pass,
But if you kids
Need any new wires or plugs,
Give me a call.
All right, well,
You're gonna miss it.
College giris, co-eds...
By the fistful.
Ooh, hey, my dad
Wants a roto-antenna.
Tell him to come by
The store.
He already talked
To a salesman at tele-mart.
That's a big mistake.
Lenny, those cats
Don't know squat about service.
Hey, hey, hey.
Lookin' good.
Hmm?
Morning.
Don't we open at 10:00
On saturdays?
Yes, we do.
And it's a good thing.
You know,
Like the flock that follows,
But it's like " herds"
With a e-a.
So it's like
Heardsmen,
- so it's one of
The six senses.
- right.
So it's spelled
Like that.
What do you
Think?
A big herd.
Heards.
I don't get it.
No, it's spelled like this,
So it's heards,
So it's one of the senses.
Music heards.
I don't-
I don't get it.
Yeah, do it.
Oh, heards,
Like hear.
Yes. It's, like,
Heardsmen.
Heardsmen.
Oh, no. Oh. Ow.
Guys.
Chad fell down.
Ok, venus?
Ok, steve.
Right.
Let's go.
Unh!
Oh, hey.
Look at this.
See this?
My grandma and i
Watched this.
Three weeks,
We've been watching it,
And last week, she realizes
There's strings.
They're puppets.
Yeah.
They're marionettes.
That's what they are.
What can I help you with
Today, gentlemen?
We have a big proposition
For you, guy.
You, uh, you still, uh,
Playing percussi√≥n?
I told you he was,
Didn't I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Every day.
We need you, skitch.
How 'bout sittin' in for chad,
Just for tonight.
Why?
Asshole...
Just broke his arm.
Let's check out these clock radios
Over here, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Would anyone notice
If chad busted his arm? Ha ha.
These are the clock radios,
Fellas.
So...what's this tune?
Well, it's an original
That I wrote.
Hey.
We wrote.
It's nothing
You can't handle.
It's just for tonight.
And if we win,
We split $100.
Um...
Wow.
Playin'
In a group again.
Man, that sounds
Like fun.
All right,
Here's the deal.
If you want
These magic hands,
You gotta buy two
New record needles.
And this radio.
Are you serious?
It's 14.95 on sale.
How 'bout
A washing machine, too?
Yeah, ok.
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go
Around with someone new
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing
And every day,
Just doin' that thing
I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do
Perfect, man.
Very good.
Took chad a week to learn that.
Chad. Who's ch-chad?
Just one song, right?
that's right.
One-derful.
I gotta go.
That's it...
Guy patterson.
That's it-
The one-ders!
And then, you know how,
Like the beatles-the beatles,
They use an e-a
As the beatles?
Well, we can use an o-n-e
Like the one-ders.
You're talkin'
Gibberish.
No, look.
The one-ders.
Lenny.
Yeah, it looks like
The o-neders.
No. The-the one-ders.
Got it. Looks like
The o-neders.
Oh, I can hear
The children laughing
I can hear
The children laughing
Yes, I hear
The children laughing
And it's not far
No, it's not
Far away
No, it's not far
And I hear
The river flowing
Yes, I hear...
Hey! You're drowning
In the river! You're drowning!
Hear the river flowing
And it's not far
No, it's not
Far away
No, it's not far
This is hardly
A date, guy.
I thought we were
Going to the movies
And dinner
At the club.
We're gonna cream
These ladies.
Well, how long
Is this going to be?
Guy, I've been looking for you
Everywhere. You got to set up.
Oh. Ok. Um...
Where are they?
Um,
Right straight back,
Through the door,
By the stage.
Great.
Tina, this is faye.
Hi. How long
Is this going to be?
Um...
You know,
I- I don't know.
I've never really been
To one of these things before.
Nice to meet you.
Whoo-whoo!
Cha cha cha!
all right, yeah!
Listen to that applause.
What do you say,
Miss talent show?
Extra good? No! Super!
Very good. That definitely
Makes the legends of brass
Of phi kappa epsilon
Way over there
At gannon college...
Our front-runners!

How are you, boys?
You-you ready?
No.
Emcee: oh, well.
Hey, how do you sell
A chicken to a deaf man?
You're
A jerkhead!
You say,
" hey, would you
Like to buy a chicken?!"
Eat my shorts,
Captain.
Shut up!
I'll kick your ass.
Are you ready?
Ready.
Oh, yeah,
Just one, please.
Hi. Have fun.
this next group,
They're all locals.
They call erie home.
The...o-neders.
all right,
Let's go!
That's "the one-ders."
1, 2, 3, 4.
That's too fast,
Guy. Slow down!
Come on, come on.
Slow down! Too fast!
Slow it down!
You
Doin' that thing
You do
Aw, come on.
That's too fast.
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces
Like you always do
And you
Don't mean to be cruel
You never even knew
About the heartache
I've been
Goin' through
And I try...
Aw, come on,
Guy. Aw.
But it's just
So hard to do
Every time you do
That thing you do
I
Know all the games
You play
I'm gonna find a way
To let you know that
You'll be mine someday
'Cause we
Could be happy,
Can't you see?
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you
And keep you here
With me
Yes, I try and I try
To forget you, girl
But it's just
So hard to do
Every time you do
That thing you do
I...
Man, what's
Goin' on here?
No one...
It's all right!
You're a lucky man!
An unhappy guy, girl
And I just can't
Take it anymore
'Cause we
Could be happy,
Can't you see?
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you
And keep you here
With me
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go
Around with someone new
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing
Every day,
Just doin' that thing
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do
Oh, my goodness!
That was fantastic!
That was way
Too fast, man.
It's a ballad!
You're right.
No, it was great!
It was great!
Oh, that's wicked!
That's sure wicked!
The o-neders
Are the champions!
Because they do
That thing you do!
That was great!
That was great, you guys!
Come over here.
I wanna talk to you.
You ever been
To villapiano's?
What, the spaghetti place
Out by the airport
That's been
In the papers?
Yeah. I gotta have ya.
I just gotta have ya.
I want you playin'
At my place next weekend.
What do you say, huh?
will there
Be money involved?
I'll pay you 100 bucks.
How's that?
we'll do it.
Yeah! Yeah, yeah!
Ooh!
I don't know.
It's like I could hear
The beat in my head, you know.
Pull over!
Hey! You guys are wicked!
You even drive
Too fast!
What are you doin' with him?
He's a drummer!
Hey, one-ders!
- whoo!
- whoo!
I don't know.
I haven't played in front of people
In so long,
So I was nervous.
But it sounds
Better fast.
Jimmy wanted it slow,
But he was wrong.
It's an up-tempo number.
And we won!
Thatjimmy fella
Certainly has a gal pal in faye.
They make
A cute couple, huh?
The only other band I was in
Was my uncle's band.
We played this wedding for free,
And then we broke up.
This one gets a paying gig.
So, what are you
Doin' next weekend?
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna see my boyfriend's
Music group.
Award-winning
Music group.
Yeah, and you're playing
At a restaurant
Out by the...airport?
Villapiano's.
And when i
Close my eyes
You'll be
Right by my side
If I could have
Just one request
Stay with me, girl
i confess
All my lone...ly
Dreams
Thank you.
Table 19,
Your pizza's ready.
Hey, when are you gonna play
That thing you do?
That's what we
Wanna hear!
Uh, has our fame
Preceded us?
Hey, we came here
To meet giris and dance,
And we can't meet giris
Until we dance!
All right, this is an opportune time
To pick it up a little.
All right, here's one
For the kid in the back.
Let's dance!
You
Doin' that thing
You do
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces
Like you...
Let it burn.
Let her burn.
Let her burn all night.
Bring me out here in the doggone
Middle of the night
To turn off the light.
Can't he ever
Get anything right?
"Oh, no. No, dad,
I'll-i'll be sure
To turn the lights off."
Hell, he couldn't
Turn a light off at the house.
Why would he ever
Turn one off down here at the store?
Know what that is?
Presidential
Flash cards?
A bonus.
Do you know why?
I have no idea.
To entice you back.
The word is out
On you o-neders.
Hey,
That's o-nedders.
The door went up
On your second set tonight.
People were callin' their friends
To come down to villapiano's.
Yeah?
I'm gonna make
A fortune off you.
I tell you- hey, don't even bother
With the fake i.d.s.
Villapiano's is closed.
Lance! Lance.
Like, so whatever
Happened to tina?
Um, she had
To help her mom
With a tupperware party,
Making food.
Well, she better get herself
Down here next time,
'Cause all the giris
Were talking about you guys
In the bathroom.
Yeah?
I almost slugged some girl
Called chrissy.
- chrissy thompkins?
- short brown hair.
Wait. What did I miss?
Who is she?
Oh, gray polka-dot dress,
Nursing a beer,
Over by the photo-booth.
Stayed for both sets.
Wait. Where was I?
Oh, playing songs
On my guitar.
Here you go, kids.
On the house.
She had her eye
On myjimmy.
Hey, three stooges,
Come on, out.
She had some fine things to say
About our drummer as well, though.
- get out. What'd she say?
- I don't know.
Hey, guys. I don't
Mean to interrupt.
I just wanna say that,
Uh, love your song, love that music.
I wanna know where I can
Get the record.
- outside.
- hey, pops!
Pops? I'll give you a pop.
Hey, wasn't
That our fan?
Hey, what do you guys
Think about that?
what?
Maybe we should
Make a record.
Like, actually
Make a record.
A record-record
Record?
Yeah,
That's what I mean.
Not one
That we'd play.
Yeah, I mean, we could, like,
Sell copies of them right here
For a buck apiece.
There's a sound booth
At tele-mart that we could use.
No, that's for,
Like, two people.
That's for
Birthday greetings.
You're talkin'
To spartacus here.
I happen to have a relative
In the record industry.
Ooh. Uncle bob?
Uncle-
Who's uncle bob?
He records church music.
Choirs, favorite sermons,
Stuff my mom listens to.
So could he
Record our music?
maybe.
Wouldn't do it
For free.
And we'd have to
Watch our language.
Wah!
'Cause we
Could be happy,
Can't you see?
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you
And keep you here
With me
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go
Around with someone new
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing
Every day,
Just doin' that thing
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do
That was swingin', man!
- swingin'?
- swingin'!
That's good, right?
Swingin' is good?
I think
It was still too fast.
Thank you, uncle bob.
Thank you very, very much.
Say hi
To your dad for me.
You got it.
Hey, what about
All my own dreams?
I got to be in buffalo
At 7:00 to record a children's choir.
I only got
That one take.
Hey, uncle bob, when are we gonna
Get these records?
Uh...
Luke 21:19.
"And your patience
Possess ye your souls."
Luke? Who's luke?
When are we
Gettin' the record?
Wednesday.

Come on!
Hey, these are
The o-neders?
No. It's the one-ders.
The one-ders. O-n-e.

Playing here tonight?

Neat-o.
Here, your change.
Thank you.

You can see me from up there?
Oh, crystal clearly.
You've been here
Every night.
You know, you guys
Are way better than anything.
I told my parents I was going over
To my friends'-
Bobbie and joanne-
To study, but I didn't.
I came here, instead.
I'm stooping to subterfuge
For you guys.
Hoo hoo. Subter-
Hey, uh, skitch,
Your girlfriend
Just walked in the door.
Oh, great.
Tina made it.
I'll handle this.
Don't worry.
Thanks.
Hi. I'm lenny.
Hi.
What's your name?
Chrissy.
T. Hey. You came!
As promised.
Hey!
And look.
New dancing shoes.
Ah. You look great.
Yeah, he's got a very
Pretty girlfriend, doesn't he?
Is it serious,
Do you know?
Very serious.
I'm single.
What about
The bass player?
He's married.
Is it always
This smoky?
Hey, ringo,
It's showtime.
Come on, you should've
Been on five minutes ago.
With them, I feel like
I'm wastin' my time
And you make me feel
Like I'm losin' my mind
Little wild
Queen
My little wild
One
Oh, I left
My girl, fine
But then I need you
All the time
Little wild one
I'll come back
I'll take one.
Little wild one,
I'll come back
Sellin' a lot of these?
I'll come back
Thank you.
To you
Thank you, erie, p-a!
Let me see that paper.
Let's see what tele-mart's
Up to here today.
Full page, of course.
Oh, get this.
Barbecue grills.
They got barbecue grills now.
For 7.89.
Good lord.
Oh, here's-
Here's somethin'.
Look here.
Shoe-polisher kit.
People can't even
Get a brush and a rag out
And shine
Their shoes anymore.
They gotta have
A shoe-polisher kit.
Man, oh, man.
" portable radio, 8.88.
"Open saturday,
10:00-10:00.
Sunday, 12:00-6:00."
Open on sunday
From 12:00-6:00.
You know, I don't believe
I wanna live in a country
Where you have
To stay open on sunday
To do business.
You shouldn't have
To work on sunday
To support a family,
Should you?
No, no. Hmm?
Let's put
That paper away.
Let's just
Take that right now.
Yeah, let's get it
Out of here.
Ok, let's get to work. Guy,
Quit fiddling around with those records
Up there in the window.
We're not selling
Records here, are we? Are we, mama?
This is an appliance store,
I believe.
It's called
Patterson's appliances.
Come on in. We're open.
Can I help you?
Y-you're the drummer,
Aren't ya?
Of that group I heard
Last night, uh...
Uh, uh,
Down at villapiano's.
Yes, I am.
Phil horace.
Guy patterson.
Do you wanna buy one of our records?
They're on sale.
I don't wanna waste
Any more of your time.
Would you step
Into my office, please?
You know, guy...
One of the good things about your group
Is there's a nice...
Natural, raw quality.
I like that.
Thank you.
And I wanna tell you,
I've been around.
And I think this...
Is a hit record.
And I found that a hit record
Is like a stew.
All the ingredients
Have to cook together just right.
Otherwise, it's just soup.
Not too early in the day
For one of these, I hope.
I'm thirsty.
I'm not sure about this.
It's a standard
Management contract.
It says if I do my job,
You guys make money.
How do we make money?
Yeah, how? You gonna wrangle us
Up some dances
At roller rinks,
Youth for christ jamborees-
Rock 'n' roll shows in steubenville,
Youngstown, pittsburgh,
Places like that.
- really?
- yeah.
- pittsburgh?
Steubenville.
Yeah.
And how would you like to hear
That thing you do on the radio?
I'd love to.
Um, sure.
Well, then,
Leave it to me.
And here's your guarantee.
If I don't get
This record going,
And I mean serious radio airplay
Inside of a week-
10 days at the most-
We'll tear this up.
I'm no longer your manager.
I don't know.
I'm reluctant
To sign anything
That has to do
With my music.
What, are you crazy?
A man in a really nice camper
Wants to put our song on the radio.
Give me a pen.
I'm signing, you're signing,
We're all signing.
Hey, do you have
Something to drink besides juice?
Yeah, I think there's some
Soda pop under that blanket.
The swelling will go down
In a couple of days.
Put cold compresses,
20 minutes at a time, all right?
I'll see you in
A couple of days.
Your new patient,
Tina powers, is here.
Hi, are you tina?
Tina? Yes.
Yes, I'm tina.
You see those ladies
Over by the stove?
Get that thing
Out of your ear and get over here.
And put the hamburger away.
You can eat anytime.
Come on!
Hi, ladies.

We-the mike's
Not working.
The mike's not working.
All right. Who am I not paying
Back here? Come on.
let's here it.
Come on!
come on!
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're the one-ders.
Would you play some
Friggin' music? Come on!
All right.
1...
2...
Forget it.
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
Right now!
Look, guy,
I keep telling ya.
You are the drummer.
You're the backbone,
The timekeeper.
You can't let a tepid reaction
From one matinee house
Affect your dedication
To the band.
I was playing like one of those
Wind-up monkey toys.
They booed us
Off the stage.
Jimmy couldn't even hear
How off-key he was.
You're gonna get it all back tonight,
I promise you.
You know what you need?
You need to sample
The exotic cuisine of the far east.
What do you say?
Come on. I'm buying.
Well, son of a gun.
We're right on time.
Here's somebody
I want you to meet.
Mr. White...
This is guy patterson.
Hi.
Sit down.
Mr. White is with
Play-tone records.
He just happened to be
In town this week,
And he caught the show
This afternoon.
Oh, great.
Nevertheless,
I think he wants to talk
Business with you.
Well, I have heard
Your record, guy, and I like it.
I like it a lot.
That thing you do,
You know, it's snappy.
Yeah, snappy.
It's a hit record.
We'd like to release it.
And add the one-ders...
To the play-tone stable
Of artists.
Just like that.
Well, some papers
Will have to be signed,
And you'll have to get me
The master recording tapes,
And you will have to say
Good-bye to phil here.
Wait. No.
Phil's our manager.
Not anymore.
My bird-dogging is done.
Play-tone's gonna take
Real good care of you.
Uh, what if we don't
Wanna be with play-tone?
I don't know, no offense.
None taken.
You want to stay
In pittsburgh
And play to the
Three rivers crowd,
Phil here
Is your man.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Guy...
Play-tone has a show
Touring state fairs.
This is the big time.
The full bore.
This is
A rock 'n' roll tour
That will feature
The one-ders
Provided you quit sitting
On your brain.
We'd be on tour?
Yeah!
A tour?
With other stars
Of the play-tone galaxy.
I have to talk this over
With the rest of the band.
See what I mean?
Smart.
Very good.
Next...this one-ders
With the o-n-e...
It doesn't work.
It's confusing.
From now on you boys
Will just be simply the wonders.
As in I wonder what happened
To the o-neders?
That's right.
Play-tone will release
The record nationally,
But you'll be doing
An awful lot of promoting as we go,
So be prepared.
All my only dreams
Is on the " b" side?
Mm-hmm.
We only got one take of that
When we did that in church.
Could we re-record that?
I don't think so.
I think it's great just the way it is.
We are gonna get you
Some new clothes.
Matching suits,
Nice suits.
Nice, because
You are nice boys.
Except maybe
For you.
So when do we cut
Our next record?
Touring is the priority,
Um,jimmy.
We're gonna meet up with the rest
Of the play-tone gang
In columbus as soon
As possible.
You'll be out on the road with them
Until labor day.
Not me.
Is this a mutiny
Already?
No, see, um...
Well, I joined the united states
Marine corps
Back at home.
So, um...
I have to report to south carolina
At the end of august,
Which means I have
To leave the band
At the end of august.
But you will stay with the band
Until the end of august?
Yes, sir.
Ok, next, uh...
Who is faye?
Uh...
Faye's sort of, uh,
Like my girlfriend.
Oh, that is
So sweet.
You want her
On tour?
She's your
Costume mistress.
All right, boys, do better tonight
Than you did today.
I'm gonna go up
And have a chat
With boss vic
Kosslovitch,
Make sure your mikes work
This time.
Ah! Guy...
See what the worid looks
Like through those.
And you...
Percussionist foster grant.
Well, you're an adult,
So go on.
Go on off then and bang
On your bongo drums as long as you like.
It's for the summer, dad.
I'll drop you a line.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah. You do that.
Tell mom I love her.
I'll tell her.
Well, mama,
Your son
Who loves you
Just left us
In the lurch.
Darlene, you just
Got promoted.
You mean, you're gonna
Start paying me?
I didn't say that.
Oh, hi, folks.
How're you doing today?
Hey, isn't it about time
You got going?
Special moment
For any recording artist.
It's our record!
Wow!
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow!
Ooh! It's got a hole in it.
It's got grooves.
It's a play-tone record!
Hey, you're missing somebody, guy.
Where's your bass player?
Oh, he went sniffing around
The chantrellines' bus.
Guess he's trying
To get a glimpse.
A big crush
On them sirens.
Diane dane!
Diane dane!
We love you.
I had my first
Boy-girl thing.
It was for a picture
Of you on a record sleeve.
Yeah, charming.
Excuse me.
Diane dane!
Really, honestly,
You were very important to me.
You the wonders?
We sure are.
And you're freddy
Fredrickson.
Aw, this is
Too much.
I heard your tune in sound check.
It's catchy, man.
Thanks.
First record
I ever bought
Was theme from mr. Downtown.
Darkness falls,
And the night's begun
Wow. You sing
Better than I do.
The river of lights
As bright as the sun
Ok. I'll see you
Out there.
Under the waning moon
There's danger
To be found
For the man with the badge
In the night
The man with the badge
In the night
What's his name?
Mr. Downtown
Mr. Downtown
Mr. Downtown
Mr. Downtown
Oh, you can't
Run away
No, you can't run away
When you're walking
Along with me
Guy, where are
Your sunglasses?
Where're your sunglasses?
Faye! Faye!
yeah?
Find guy's glasses,
His sunglasses, quick!
The portly gentleman
Sniffing his stogy is k.o. Bailey.
He's columbus' second most popular
Disc jockey.
Well, he's the biggest
Cootie I ever saw.
If he likes
What he hears,
He's gonna play that thing you do
Tomorrow morning
With 50,000 watts
Behind it.
It's very important
You don't stink today.
Hey, I make
No guarantees.
We bow, right?
In unison.
And we're off the stage
Before the applause dies out, right?
What if they
Want an encore?
You unplug and you run,
Run off stage...
Smiling,
Smiling of course.
Here you go. Here.
No encores! Guy,
Keep these with you.
Put 'em on. Put 'em on.
There you go.
From now on, you have them with you
Day and night.
They're your trademark.
You look good in 'em.
You guys look great
In red.
Have I told you that, yet?
You have your pick?
Right here.
Downtown
All right, this is it.
If the crowd doesn't
Go wild for you,
Don't worry about it.
They will tomorrow.
Thank you, ohio.
All right. Timing is everything
On the entrance.
Fix his jacket so it
Doesn't pouf up behind.
Let's give
A big welcome

On the drums, man.
What was it like to record
With del paxton?
Miss dane, hi. I'm james mattingly
From the wonders.
Oh, yes. Hi.
Nice to see you.
Did you know we became 21
In billboard?
Faye, what is jimmy doing
At diane dane's table?
He's showing her how the record made
Number 21 in billboard.
A record actually
Climbing the charts.
She'll be chartreuse
With envy.
I'll have another one of these
With no straw.
Yes, sir.
I've played
A lot of cards.
Obviously.
See my deck?
See? You gotta be quick.
You gotta be quick
With me.
I'm from erie, p-a.
Cheers.
Tell me something, faye.
How long have you and jimmy
Been you and jimmy?
21/2 years.
Whew. Now, that is
A long time.
He's amazing.
Amazing.
He is.
He's amazing.
Now, what about
Guy there?
Does anybody at home
Think he's amazing?
Well, he had a girlfriend
Back in erie.
Um, tina. I met her
A couple of times.
She fell in love
With her dentist.
Now, that's too bad.
Yeah.
Let's try maybe these.
Thinner frames.
Ok.
Take those off.
Put these on.
Ok, look at me, guy.
Look at me.
These are hip?
No. Something else.
Try these on.
Hide your cards.
Sit down.
Watch these guys.
They're musicians. They cheat.
So, we're gonna play
The 8,jack...
Your worid goes on
But for me,
My worid is over
Don't know where
I'm gonna go now
But I got to move on
Somehow
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Whoa, whoa
It hurts me so badly,
Deep down inside
When I think about
All of your lies
Oh
Your worid goes on
But for me,
My worid is over
You fellas look
Great in gold.
Have I told you
That?
You straight on
Those harmonies now?
Check.
Now, you boys have fun.
I think this is loose.
What is this?
That was diane dane.
There she is.
Diane dane.
Look at that dress, huh?
That's a-
That's a gold dress,
Like a wisconsin sunrise.
Get out of my way.
This next group...
Excellent.
You've all been
Waiting for...
Here they are...
Playing that thing that's
Racing up the charts...
Look out, wisconsin,
It's...the wonders!
'Cause we
Would be happy,
Can't you see?
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you
And keep you here
With me
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go
Around with someone new
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing
Every day,
Just doin' that thing
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do
Why do we have
To stand on stage
With those other acts at the end
Of the show?
Because we're members of the play-tone
Galaxy of stars.
Did you see
The cast of bonanza
Signing autographs
This afternoon?
I shook hoss' hand.
He had his gun on and everything.
Next weekend:
The beverly hillbillies.
Ah, miss elly may.
Miss elly may go skinny-dippin'
In the cee-ment pond.
Elly may.
I love her.
Inside, inside. Come on.
Change of plans.
We are leaving here
Just as soon as possible.
That thing you do
Is the fastest-rising single
In the history of
The play-tone label.
As of tomorrow morning,
You wonders-
You've got the number 7 record
In the country.
Aah!
- oh, my god!
- ohh!
Ha ha ha!
Watch the shelf.
Look, state fairs
Are small potatoes.
We are on a plane,
Flying to the coast...
As long as we make
The airport on time.
- to california?
- disneyland?
That's right.
California.
number 7 this week.
Number 1 next week.
If we become
Number one,
Does that mean
We get a gold record?
500,000 copies
For a gold.
Heyyyyy!
Put your glasses
On, shades.
Give 'em
What they want.
Ha ha!
Shades.
The horses
Are coming.
Where's the limo?

Isn't it?
No, you've
Got a fever.
You're warm.
Here, lie down.
Just gotta
Bundle you up.
Skitch, band meeting
With herr play-tone.
Ok.
There you are.
Now, sleep. No talking.
We're winging our way
To the coast.
Mmm, california.
Here we come.
You know, faye's
Not feeling very good.
I wanna know when we'll get
Into a recording studio.
First things first,
Fellas.
You have to go off
And pay homage
To mr. Sol siler.
He's the founder and chairman
Of play-tone records.
What hotel are
We staying at?
It's the place
Lucy and ricky stayed
When they came out
With fred and ethel.
And then we go
Into the studio?
Exactly.
'Cause the point
Of all this
Is to make
More records.
What would you fellas
Think about
Making an appearance in
A major motion picture?
Whoa-ho-ho!
What movie?
Then, something
Very grand on the horizon,
If I have worked
The phones correctly-
The hollywood
Televisi√≥n showcase.
Hmm?
we are gonna
Be on tv.
Man!
Then after that,
Sometime,
Discmaster studios
On sunset...
We cut another record.
Any questions,
Don't ask.
I'm tired
Of talking to you,
And I want to sleep.
Lenny, give me
That paper.
Give me the paper.
Lenny, why don't you
Go and see if you can
Visit the cockpit?
Tell them it's your birthday.
Go, go, go.
Hey, rose.
Hi, lamarr.
I don't have any cash.
Well, then charge it
To your room, cherie.
2242.
Excuse me.
Ooh. And I'll send you up
Some soup, too.
Oh, thank you.
My name is lamarr,
And this is my hotel,
And we take care
Of people here.
I'm faye.
Didn't I check you
In with a quartet of gentlemen?
And why aren't they here to take care
Of your needs?
They're off making
A major motion picture.
Oh, we got movie stars
In my hotel.
They're musicians,
Actually.
Even better.
Whoo!
rick! Anita!
The music stopped.
Yeah. Keep playing.
All right, anita,
I get the message.
It's about time
You noticed, rick.
Thanks, goofball.
Sure thing,
Anita sweetheart.

Now look out
At the ocean.
Say the line.
We're being
Invaded!
Run out of
The shot!
Playback!
Playback!
- cut!
- cut! Cut! Cut!
Print it!
Excellent!
Hey, guys,
Boots randolph!
Yeah!
We look like a bunch
Of chimpanzees.
No. We look like
A rock 'n' roll band
Playing
A rock 'n' roll song
During weekend at party pier.
We're not the wonders
Right now.
We're cap'n geech and
The shrimp shack shooters.
Hey, good news,
Fellas.
You get to keep
Your wardrobe.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, do we have
A top-10 record?
You sure do.
Then we shouldn't
Be here.
Would you rather be back
On that state fair tour?
They're playing
North dakota this week.
No, no, no.
I vote for weekend at party pier.
Smart man.
You should have told us about this
Rick and anita movie.
So mark that date-
Saturday and sunday,
August 20th and 21 st,
Pacific car showroom.
Just look for the kmpc
Hit caravan and me.
I'll be out there
Signing autographs.
If you want a picture of me
In my official dodge boys
Rally team windbreaker,
Well, then i
Just might oblige.
But hey! I got some exciting guests
On my show today.
Makers of a hit record,
Visitors from the east-
Oops! Hold on, giris.
Not those mop-tops.
Ha ha ha.
No, I'm talking
About america's own
Wonderful...wonders!
Say hello, fellas!
- hi!
- hi!
And here's their hit-
A big l.a. Fave rave at 10 minutes
Past 7:00 in the morning
On kmpc...los √°ngeles!
Thanks, guys.
Just leave the headphones in there.
That thing you do
Breaking my heart-
let me ask
You cats this question:
Who were your influences?
Which artists
Popped your cherry?
The chantrellines.
The chantrellines.
Dion and the belmonts.
Cap'n geech and
The shrimp shack shooters.
Uh...stan getz-
Anything he did on
The verve label...
Bill evans tr√≠o,
Ira sullivan,
Kenny durham,
John young...
Del paxton.
Yeah.
Time to blow.
My uncle gave me that record,
And we played it in
The high school band.
Del paxton in the high school band-
That's wild.
Yeah, we were pretty wild
In erie, penn.
There was this one time
When we stayed up
Way past midnight, and...
Smiling, smiling...
Wait a minute, gigi.
Hold on, hold on.
Let's have the label
Right side up, shall we?
Hey, how come you guys
Don't have long hair like the beatles?
Don't you guys
Like the beatles?
You, in the linettes,
Are those prescription,
Or are you just trying
To look cool?
Well, I am
The drummer.
Oh.
Where the hell
Is solly?
Sol siler is here!
- hooray!
- all right!
- solly!
- hi, gigi!
- hey, solly!
Billy, how you doing?
Hey, fran,
Is that you?
How was
Acapulco, sol?
Wonderful,
Wonderful.
Did mimi go with you,
Or did she have to stay home?
She had the flu.
Solly, how's your pals
In the sheriff s department?
You guys spend a little too much time
In the wrong places.
Solly, is it true don drysdale
Gave you a sock in the snooker?
Old news, fred.
Old news.
Business, gents.
Got to take care of business.
Wanna tell you about my new boys,
The wonders.
Top-10 and fastest ever
Teen sensations.
Caused the worst riot in texas
Since oswald got shot.
So, solly, saw you at chasen's
With suzanne pleshette.
Quit with that.
The wife works upstairs.
Let's go have
Some deli.
Lookin' good.
What about the
Dave clark five?
You think all this
British beat stuff is new?
Give us another month,
We'll be invading them.
Is that it?
Yeah.
I'll be sure to give him
The message.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Hi.
Hi.
How you doin'?
Good.
So, how long have you worked
Here at play-tone?
How long you been wearing
Such tight pants?
Wow, if that was
A pick-up line,
We're a match
Made in heaven.
Excuse me, mr. Siler.
James mattingly ii,
Lead singer ofthe wonders.
I wrote
That thing you do.
I wrote many other songs
That I think we should
Make an appointment and share.
What is jimmy doing?
arrghh!
Jimmy!
What in the bloody hell
Is this?
This is during
My lunchtime?
Yeah, like I got
Time on my hands-
You wanna get fabian
Away from me?
he doesn't know
Who we are.
To him, we could
Be anybody.
he knows who
The wonders are.
he didn't listen
To any other songs?
that guy hasn't even heard
That thing you do.
I don't think sol siler's
The person who listens to songs.
he's the guy
Who's in charge
Of the entire
Play-tone galaxy.
This is the man who's in charge
Of our collective fate,
Our creative destiny.
Oh...come on!
Diane warned me
About this.
Diane dane?
Diane dane.
What'd she say?
Never trust a label.
And I'm beginning
To believe her.
Lenny:
Oh, I agree.
Come on, they put us up
In a first-class hotel,
All expenses paid
While our record climbs the charts.
Bunch of lying snakes.
I'm sorry
I'm bugging you.
I guess I'm alone
In my principles.
Come on.
There he goes, off to his room
To write that hit song,
Alone /n
My principles.
Young squires,
Young squires.
Faye, I'm glad to see you're
Feeling better.

To show you the town.
God! Great!
Breath-good? No?
All right. See you guys.
Hold my calls.
Listen, have you
Kids had dessert?
Try the
Peach cobbler.
Best in
The southland.
Hey, I got you
Some flowers.
You gotta understand
Something aboutjimmy.
His-his standards
Are way up there
Because he's so smart.
He tested in high school
At genius level,
So that's why...
I feel terrible.
I'm gonna go back to bed.
Yeah, that's
A good idea.
Bye, faye.
Bye. Thanks.
- ma'am.
- thank you.
Ifjimmy's a genius...
I'm u thant.
Who's u thant?
He's the secre-
Forget it.
You wanna get
Out of here?
Go see some
Of the coast?
Yes, definitely.
Or maybe, um...
What's that theater
That the, um-
The movie stars put their hands
In the front?
Oh. Grauman's
Chinese theater.
That'd be fun.
Excuse me, sirs.
Um, I wanted to inform you
That I'll be joining your ranks soon,
And, um, I can already
Do 200 pushups.
Really, boot?
Yes, sir.
Why don't you give us 100

Yes, sir!
Count 'em off.

Young squire?
Um, yeah. Anybody
Calls for me,

With suzanne pleshette.
Gotcha.

Oh, you want good jazz?
Good jazz?

A question.

Oh, I got married
In portland. Yeah.
Oh, and then I left portland
For reno,
And then I got
Divorced in reno.
Then wised up and faced
The inevitable.
You know, I moved to l.a.
Is the tr√≠o
Going on again?
I don't know.
Looks like they're
Kind of busy
Doing the cock 'n' bull
With del there.
Del?
Yeah, del paxton.
One of the regulars.
Roving hands,
But good cock 'n' bull.
Del paxton.
Mm-hmm.
Del paxton's
Sitting over there?
Yeah.
Gabby, ha ha ha!
Oh, gabby?
He owes me money, man.
Oh...oh,
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Del paxton
Is sitting over there.
Oh, heh heh heh.
I just lost you,
Didn't I?
You wanna meet him?
What? No...no.
- ha ha ha!
- ha ha ha!
- ain't that the truth.
- that's gabby.
Marguerite,
What you got here?
You may not
Believe this, del,
But this kid has
Heard of you.
That right?
Well, sit down. Buy me a drink.
Del paxton.
Who are you?
I'm guy patterson.
I'm from erie, pennsylvania.
I'm in a band
Called the wonders,
And we're-we
Just cut a record,
And we're out here
On the coast,
And I play
The drums,
And I have
All your records.
Well, not all of them,
But a lot of them.
At least I did until
Some of them got swiped
When I was stationed
In germany,
And you were
Playing in germany
At the time I was
Stationed there.
But, you know what?
I couldn't see you
Because you were
Playing in hamburg
And I was stationed
In munich.
But I listen
To your records,
And I think
You're great.
You are
My biggest fan.
Heh heh.
Thanks.
I'll have another
Hennessey.
A hennessey for
Del paxton.
All right.
Ain't no way to keep
A band together.
Bands come and go.
You got to keep on playin',
No matter with who.
You guys any good?
Yeah.
Yeah, man, we got-
Jimmy and lenny
And me and...faye-
We got something
Snappy.
Really think we do.
I'm sure you do,
But sooner or later,
Something makes you crazy:
Money, women, the road.
Hell, man,just time.
Well, we've only been
Together for 2 months.
Some bands I been with,
That's 2 months too long.
Last call, lovers.
I'm gone.
You keep on playin'...
And watch your money.
You'll land
On your feet.
Thanks for
Your hospitality.
Thank you,
Del paxton.
Nice young man,
Huh, marguerite?
Oh, very nice
Young man, del.
Good night.

Thank you, del!
Just look at you.
You're no good
To me now.

Her apartment last night,

Some howling.

Our bass player?
Isn't he here?
No. I gotta call
The hotel.
How far a drive
Is it to las vegas?
'Cause I'm driving

Through the desert
With the top down.

Big live broadcast?
Huh? Huhhhhhh?

Of options here, guy.

But seriously, gus...
What is it like flying up there

Have to say
That flying

Latest movie-
It's out of
This worid.
Here's a question
I have...
Going back
To one.
How's the food?

Turkey product,
Processed succotash,
And a packet of concentrated
Prune juice-
Oh...that's gotta hurt.

Hi-fabulous in

I can just imagine
Guy backstage right now,
Just waiting to go on.
You think they'll show
A shot of him backstage, dear,
Waiting to go on?
No, honey, they won't show
Him backstage.
They'll show him
When he comes out to perform.
I wonder how many people
Are watching this.
How many people saw the beatles
On the ed sullivan show?
Excuse me.

Yeah, right there.

'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

Someone new
New-ooh
And if I know you
You're doin'

For you, babe
I'm lovin'
I'm lovin'
That thing you do
Oh, that's
Hilarious!
Oh, thank you.
Whoo hoo hoo!
So, it just
Appeared...
Like magic...
For the whole worid
To see.
I didn't
Say anything.
I was just as
Surprised as you.
"Careful, giris,
He's engaged."
Am I supposed to buy you
Some diamond ring now?
You're ruining this
Beautiful moment.
Where'd you get the idea
That we're engaged?
We're not!
That's the last thing
I need in the worid.
- we were great! What,
Are you kidding?
you're kidding.
You kidder.
Hey, man, you have a couple
Of hundred bucks?
I need some extra scratch
For the craps tables.
No.
No?
Come on!
Just a little bit.
This is my first trip
To vegas.
Try guy.
He's a sucker.
Well, that was
Very nice.
Whitey, can you spot me
Some blackjack cash?
That would be
Against my policy.
Mr. White,
It isn't true.
Oh ho
Ho ho!
Guy, can I borrow
Some money?
200 bucks.
How much you want?
Hah. Chump change.
Good lord, faye,
You look gorgeous.
Now, next up
For you kids...
You get to make
Another record.
Can I say
Something?
Hey, the fair faye
Wishes to address us all,
So it's...
Jimmy...
From now on,
You stay away from me.
I have wasted thousands
And thousands of kisses on you.
Kisses that I thought
Were special because
Of your lips and your smile
And all your
Color and life.
I used to think that was the real you
When you smiled.
But now I know that you
Don't mean any of it,
And you just save it
For all your songs.
Shame on me for kissing you
With my eyes closed so tight.
Should've dumped you
In pittsburgh!
Which one of you butts
Said we were engaged?
The same person who said
You had class,jimmy.
Let's blow, babe.
Get that desert air
In my hair.
Ok.
Do we really have to go
With the top down?
Take those stupid
Sunglasses off.
Why couldn't you
Have dumped her in pittsburgh?
We do my songs,
Or we don't record anything.
You got that, white?
Ok.jimmy.
I was looking forward
To working with you.
You know,
You're a liar, white!
You're a liar.
And you're in
A tough spot,jimmy,
'Cause you didn't read
The play-tone contract
That you yourself signed,
Because it says
You do what I say.
And I say you cover
These songs from
The play-tone catalog.
You record that thing you do
In spanish.
You get one cut
Per side of the lp,
But I don't want any of
This lover's lament crap.
I want something peppy,
Something happy,
Something up-tempo.
I want something snappy.
All right.
I...
I quit
I quit
I quit
I quit, mr. White.
Jimmy just quit.
Your band is
Falling apart, guy.
Where's lenny?
I have no idea.
I am so happy!
Oh, I can't wait
For tonight!
Oh, yeah!
Thanks so much.
I really-
Thanks a lot!
Thanks
For being here!
Thanks for
Sharing!
Oh, wow, I'm really so happy.
Well, I guess
You don't need me today.
Yeah. Wolfman,
Thank you very much.
You're a good man,
Scott pell.
Give me a call
Later on in the week.
We'll do something.
I can't believe this.
The wonders are
In breach of contract.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry,
Mr. White.
Well, don't worry.
No one's going to prison, son.
It's a very common tale.
Well, maybe for you,
But I was in a band,
And we still have
A hit record.
Yeah, you do.
One-hit wonders.
It's a very
Common tale.
My first time in
A real recording studio.
You want to hang
Around for a while?
Ok by me.
But you're out of the hotel
This afternoon.
Can't help that.
You know, guy, horace
Was right about you.
You are the smart one.
Lenny is the fool.
Jimmy is...the talent.
Faye is...
Well, now, faye is
Special, isn't she?
And you are
The smart one.
That's what
I think anyway.
How you been?
Doing all right.
How about you?
All right.
Hanging in.
what do you call that?
/ am spartacus.
Ha ha ha!
You wanna lay it down?
Nah. I was just
Goofing around.
Hey, my man.
Hey, del!
What's your name again?
Guy...uh,
Guy patterson.
Guy. Yeah,
That's right.
Hey, you're good.
Oh, you heard that?
Swing.
Thank you.
Uh, can I jam
With you a bit?
You want to jam
With me?
Why not?
Sure. Sure.
All right.
What are you
Doing here?
Recording some tracks in studio c
With willy walker.
Willy walker?
Can he jam
With us, too?
Nah, let's keep
This a duet.
Let's play that spartacus again.
Hey, ernie...
Roll tape on this.
You got it, del.
Go ahead.
Count it off.
1...2...3...4.
Hey!
Yeah. I'll talk
To you later.
Hey, hey, hey.
Slow down there, young squire.
Life is long.
I got to check out.
Oh, you're leaving us
Today, too, huh?
Yeah, well, that
Partner of yours-
The one with all
The attitude?
He left here hours ago.
And your little fifi
Is about to vamoose as well.
Wait, fifi-you mean faye.
Is she still here?
Yeah. She's sitting there
In the coffee shop.
At the counter. Alone.
Now, where I come from,
That just ain't right.
Take that.
lamarr here.
Yes, sir.
Blue impala.
Absolutely.
Uh-huh.
Thank you, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!
Now, that ain't your job.
Del says I got the chops to make it
As a drummer in l.a.
- oh.
- so I think I'm gonna
Give it a try.
Really?
So, you're-you're gonna be
A permanent west coaster?
Yeah, it looks
That way.
Wow.
So, what are you
Gonna do?
Hmm...
I'm gonna
Go back to erie.
Figured that's
What you'd say.
Guy...
Can I ask you
A question?
Shoot.
Were you in love
In erie?
You know,
I thought so.
With that
Tina woman?
She wasn't right
For you.
Was she
A good kisser?
Yeah.
Yeah?
It would be ungentlemanly
For me to elaborate.
Gentlemen- I forgot what you
Fellas looked like.
Well, sir...
If you ever
Come back to erie,
Please stop by
And see me.
Right. We'll listen
To records.
That'd be nice.
And here's good-bye.
You know that none
Of this would have happened
If you hadn't
Joined the band.
And I mean that
In a good way.
Bye.
So, young squire...
Before you go...
Let me ask you
One question.
Shoot.
When was the last time you were
Decently kissed?
I mean, truly, truly...
Good and kissed?
Dave gammelgard...
New year's eve...
'61.
Ok.
Mm!
Whoo.
Whoo.
We should have done that
A long time ago.
Yeah.
Lamarr, would you mind
Watching our things?
Oh, that's
What I do.
I never thought my life
Would end up
Quite this way
Sometimes
It's hard to figure out
What I should say
I tried alone
To mend this broken heart
I need you
That thing you do
When we're apart
I find it very hard
To smile
You know that
Other giris
Have never been
My style
Well, there's a feeling
That I get
When I'm near you
I need you
That thing you do
I could search
Around the worid
Only to find
The only thing I need
Is you right by my side
There's a feeling
That I get
When I'm with you
Oh, oh, oh
That thing you do
I could search
Around the worid
Only to find
The only thing I need
Is you right by my side
I never thought my life
Would end up
Quite this way
Sometimes it's hard
To figure out
What I should say
I've tried alone
To mend this broken heart
I need you
That thing you do
I need you
That thing you do
I've never known
Someone like this
She's got a look
I can't resist
I know
In just a little while
I'll be the one
That makes her smile
Her parents say
That I'm no good
I don't come
From her neighborhood
Ohh
Before too long
They'll see though
Just what
She sees in me
But when
She holds my hand
I think
She understands
She knows it
It's true
It might take
A little while
I'll be the one
That makes her smile
But when
She holds my hand
I think
She understands
She knows it
She knows
She knows
She knows
She knows
All my hopes and dreams
She knows
She knows
She knows
She means
Everything to me
Someday
I'm gonna make her see
How good together
We can be
It's true
It might take
A little time
One day I'm gonna
Make her mine
But when
She holds my hand
I think
She understands
She knows it
She knows it
She knows it
