Devin, I'm at the back entrance.
I'm going in.
Okay, it's me.
Daddy?
You're okay. Yeah, you're okay.
Okay, we're gonna get
out of this place now.
Come on, baby.
Okay.
Here we go. Hold my hand. Hold my hand.
Yo, Drummer, you copy?
Dev, made contact... Come here.
Back, back, back, back.
All right, you're okay. Come on.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on, come on.
We got away.
All right, we're going back in!
...land of opportunity
is offering just that to our enemies.
...the magnitude of destruction
our director of defense,
the United Nations,
and the Centers for Disease
Control warning us about?
I don't know the words to tell you
how I wish I could be where you are...
Protect you...
Hold you...
If there was a way,
I would save you from this war...
which has covered everything...
you, your mom...
our world...
Every morning, I see your face.
I hear your laugh...
your footsteps on the living room floor.
Every night I dream when you were born.
Now I wonder if you're safe.
You can fear for me as much
as I fear for you and your mom.
I won't stop looking, Johnny.
I won't quit.
They taught us that in the Corps.
Never give up.
Ever.
Come in.
Captain, missing debrief?
Corporal Drummer.
Lance Corporal, sir.
Ah. Captain Peyton.
Nice to finally meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept.
It's been a tough couple of weeks.
Please, my chateau.
Can I get you anything?
Just a water, a Coke.
Well, we have a mini fridge
for the court case.
That's a nice perk.
We get a few over here.
It's got cane sugar.
Mexicans do it right, don't they?
That your son?
Godson. Zachary.
You got kids of your own,
- or just the godson?
- Well, right now,
I'm here with you.
So, this will be more informal
than other meetings
you may have had over the incident,
but if you would,
I'd like you to tell me
a little bit about yourself...
your life outside the Corps.
It's not much.
I don't know, you probably got it
all in there, don't you?
Some of it. I'd prefer
to hear it from you.
Married eight years.
One child.
Yep. Jon.
Jonathan.
Jonathan Michael Drummer.
What about Corporal Roberts?
How would you describe
your relationship with him?
Most squared-away Marine I know.
Love him like family.
Trust nobody in the world
with family but him.
Pull one trigger,
regret the rest of your life.
Yeah, fuck it.
- You don't think like that?
- Like what?
Regrets. You ain't got no regrets.
Huh?
You ain't got no regrets.
I have regrets.
Name one.
Well...
I regret bringing you into this bullshit.
He carried me every step of the way.
I mean, I probably wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Roberts.
And how does that make you feel now?
Not sure.
Well, you must have
some feelings about it.
About how...
I mean, I don't... I don't know.
I'm just trying to get back to my son.
Of course you do. You miss him.
I don't see...
what the point of all this is.
Well, because this is mandatory,
until my local clock strikes seven,
you're expected to remain here, so...
we might as well make the most of it.
Roger.
You got all the power, sir.
But if you'd prefer, we need
not talk about your son.
I'd like that.
You motherfuckers think y'all Marines?
Yes, Sergeant!
I said do you motherfuckers
think y'all are Marines?
Yes, Sergeant!
Good Marines have bled for the Corps.
Good Marines have died for the Corps.
Do you believe you deserve
to die with that same honor?
Yes, Sergeant!
I said do you think you deserve
to die with that honor?
Yes, Sergeant!
Yeah. Y'all look scared!
You might be happy to be a Marine,
but you look scared!
And for that reason
I am inserted into your life.
The papers you're holding
are the serial numbers to your new rifles.
You will memorize these numbers
along with a whole slew
of other information
I deem necessary!
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Sergeant!
You understand you're holding
a piece of paper, Marine?
Yes, Sergeant!
How much does a piece of paper weigh?
How much does a piece of paper weigh?
- Nothing, Sergeant!
- How much?
- Nothing, Sergeant!
- Then why are your arms falling?
Why are your arms falling?
Why are your arms falling?
Why are your arms falling? Tell me why!
Tell me why! Tell me why!
- Tell me why!
- I don't know, Sergeant.
You don't know why your arms are falling?
- No, Sergeant.
- Keep them up!
Keep the piece of fucking paper!
Be prepared to be pushed to new levels.
Be prepared to be pissed off and on
until you become worthy of appearing
when the enemy says...
Again, keep them up!
Pick it up!
Welcome to the pain, rubes!
Welcome to the pain!
- Welcome to the pain!
- Welcome to the pain!
- Welcome to the what?
- Welcome to the pain!
Buddy up and move onto the course.
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Move! Move!
Move! Let's go!
Move it! Let's go!
Forget that fool. We got this.
Move it! Move it!
Let's go, bro! Let's go.
Hurry up!
Group two, hurry the fuck up!
Hurry the fuck up, brother!
Hurry the fuck up!
- Flank! Set!
- Move out!
Close our front!
- Move out!
- I'm up, he sees me, I'm down!
- Stay down!
- Move it!
Shut it off!
What the fuck are you saying, Marine?
Nothing, Sergeant!
- Was I talking to you, Marine?
- No, Sergeant, sir!
Then why the fuck
are you answering for him?
- I don't know, Sergeant.
- You two butt buddies, Marine?
- No, Sergeant.
- Get the fuck up!
Yes, Sergeant.
You got a mouthful of shit, Marine.
Sorry, Sergeant.
We need to go.
- Back to the top!
- Yes, Sergeant.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
I signed up for Greenpeace.
How the fuck did we wind up here?
Fucking dolphins dying, dude.
We could be saving the dolphins, man.
You should tell him that
when we're out there.
That's right.
"Sergeant Miller, I signed
up for Greenpeace, sir."
Stay.
Seriously, you're worse than Johnny.
Stop moving or I will cut you.
- Nat.
- "I'm-a cut you."
- That was good, right?
- That was pretty good.
All right, come on.
I'll stop fucking around. Go.
Ow!
- Ow.
- Okay, stop.
God, you're such a wimp.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just can't sleep.
I mean, I sleep but then I'm up, you know?
Just back and forth.
I'll take him today.
- You should take him today.
- Mm.
Talk to the teacher.
Kids giving him problems.
Yeah, you need to talk to the teacher,
and then talk to that one mom.
- Which one? Which one?
- I hate that woman.
The fat kid's mom. She...
I almost punched her the other day.
I mean, in my mind I punched her.
- You're a thug.
- Yeah, that's right.
Your wife's a thug.
- I'm serious. Come on.
- I love you.
Yeah? Say it to my face.
I love you.
You better.
You look good. You look like a Marine.
Good.
Get out. You gotta take him.
Yeah.
Let me just get it right here.
Tell that mom!
I see you.
You can't see me from there.
Yeah, I can. I'm looking right at you.
What are you talking about?
I see you right there.
Nope, still see you.
Now I can't see you,
but if I can't see you, you can't see me.
Why is that?
I don't know why is that,
it's just the rules.
What are you learning in school?
You learning fun stuff?
We read, do recess,
listen to music, dance.
Rec... What kind of...? Dancin' around?
That sounds very arty-farty to me, bud.
Speak of the devil...
- Dad!
- Oh, no!
What is that!
You'd better get the window, bud.
- I'm gonna die!
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Marines, clear out!
Medic, man down!
Uh, oh! Uh, oh! Is he responding?
- Is he responding? He's responding.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!
- What does that mean?
- Responding?
No, "man down."
Man down is a...
that's a military term.
It's what you say when...
one of your boys goes down
or someone gets hurt, or...
Let me take a wild guess of who that is.
Is that him right there?
All right, I'm gonna come in with you
so they don't mess with you.
- No! Please.
- Why?
- It's just...
- What are you embarrassed of me?
I can walk from here, really.
I know you can walk from here.
You're a grown boy.
How'd this start up?
You just walked in one day
and they started in on you?
- No.
- What happened?
They heard Mom say "I love you"
when she dropped me off.
She said "I love you" in front
of your friends, huh?
Mm-hmm.
All right, I understand. It's no good.
- And you told Mom?
- Yeah.
What'd she say?
She said she was gonna beat the mother up.
She was gonna beat the mothers up?
All right, look.
I'm not Mom, but I damn sure
am gonna tell my kid
I love him when he gets
out the car, all right?
- Yeah.
- So we gotta come up with
some kind of little middle ground,
like a secret word or something.
What about "man down"?
- Man down?
- That's pretty good.
- Huh? Yeah.
- Yeah, I like that. Man down.
I like it, too.
It's got the word "man" in it,
damn sure is manly enough.
You know, we'll just sneak it out
anytime we want to say it.
Nobody will know what we're talking about.
So anytime I want to say I love you,
what am I going to say to you?
- Man down.
- Like that, too,
with that little smirk on your face.
- Say it again.
- Man down.
Yes, good, man.
All right, get out of here.
Have a good day, bud.
You too.
Drummer. Yo, Drummer, you copy?
I got a tudy up ahead
approximately 100 yards southeast
of the main courtyard.
Right there.
What the fuck?
- How long's he been sitting there?
- I don't know.
And yourself?
I'm not sure. Come on, let's go.
What the fuck?
Don't move. Get up. Up. Move.
Down in that corner.
Down. Who are you?
United States Marines. If you
try anything, I take your head off!
- Got that clear?
- Who are you?
Answer the question.
Who are you?
- Charles. My name is Charles.
- Charles?
Hey, Charles. Take a breath. Breathe.
My name's Gabriel.
I'm looking for survivors, you understand?
Okay, man.
What do you know about what happened here?
What happened to...?
To who? The world. Everything.
How come you weren't affected?
How come you weren't affected?
- Oh, please.
- How is it the whole world is in shit
and you're not affected?
Save your compliments for someone
who'd want to hear them.
- This whole world's fucked.
- You're alone?
You got survivors with you?
I got my friends. I got my whole platoon.
Where are they?
- Hey! Stay right there.
- Don't move.
What is it?
You semper fi?
That was a long time ago, buddy.
Whole 'nother world,
but it don't matter none.
They all left us here in hell to rot.
Who did?
You did.
You.
Look, I've been analyzing or pontificating
on variations of this theme for years.
Today I'll state only facts.
There's a mini war in the Middle East.
Iran will most likely have
a nuclear weapon.
Putin basically running unchecked,
obviously a great cause for concern.
Dude, this little guy's gonna
jump out of the fucking box.
Well, put her down.
- Not yet, little buddy.
- Did you see this?
I've got some bowls
for water in the truck.
Oh. Nice present.
...Centers for Disease Control...
- He loves it.
- ...has downgraded the urgency.
While the term
"weapons of mass destruction"
has become a political taboo,
no one can deny that the CDC,
the Centers for Disease Control,
has been the lead story
more frequently than ever.
Okay, I'm bringing
the birthday boy in, all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That comes on again at 11, right?
- All right!
- Come on, pal!
Hey!
Now, what did you want more
than anything in the world, bud?
A year's supply of gummy bears!
- More than gummy bears!
- All right, listen, your dad...
What's that noise?
- That sound like gummy bears?
- No.
What's that noise, bud?
- Your daddy and I talked about all the...
- Hey, what's that sound like?
What's that sound like? A puppy!
Oh, my gosh! A puppy! So cute!
- Don't squeeze him too hard.
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.
What do you think?
- He's amazing!
- Oh, he loves him.
- Wanna show Luke?
- Mm-hm.
Go show Luke the dog.
- Be careful.
- Go show Luke the dog.
Everyone, look! It's a puppy!
- He loves it.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I wouldn't have done that without you.
Yeah. Be careful!
- Oh, don't tell me I missed that.
- You missed that.
What? He lose his shit?
Lost it. I'm gonna party with him.
There he is.
Okay. You gonna shoot me?
What are you gonna name the dog?
I was thinking Ichabod.
What do you know about dog hats?
What do you know about dog hats?
You want dog hats?
- You've never had a dog hat?
- Nope!
Hey, Luke, what do
you know about dog hats?
He'll be all right.
Close your eyes.
Do not rub your eyes
once I apply the application.
- Roger, Sergeant.
- Take a deep breath.
Turn around when you're ready. OC, OC.
Open your eyes. How many
fingers am I holding up?
- Open them.
- Two, Sergeant.
- Move, go!
- That's right, let's go! Let's go!
Let's go, move!
Get mad, Marine, get mad!
Get back, get back, get back, get back!
This is our push! Spread out!
Move! Move! Let's go!
Speed up! Speed up!
Let's go! Let's go!
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get back, get back, get back,
get back, get back, get back!
Let's go! Let's go!
What the fuck are you doing, Marine?
Why the fuck are you rubbing your eyes?
- I can't see, Sarge.
- Of course you can't see.
Your fucking eyes are closed.
What do you believe
the simple solution to that would be?
Open my eyes, Sarge.
Well, there you go! Figure this shit out.
And look how fucking easy that was!
Keep your head up and eyes on
the fucking target!
- Look at this shit, man.
- Keep moving.
Huh? Fucking beautiful!
You ask, "Why the pain?
Why the deprivation?"
Eh, fuck, man.
All right, come on.
Pain doesn't subside as your enemy listens
for sounds to fire towards.
Move, motherfucker, move!
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Hand over your rifle.
Roberts, help out your fellow Marine.
Looks like he could use some water.
Next!
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Come on, brother, push it out. Come on.
Push it out. Come on, brother.
Well, somebody gotta applaud
the Jamaican bobsled team.
Am I right, Marines?
Yes, Sergeant!
- Am I right, Marines?
- Yes, sir!
The fuck.
That burns like a motherfucker.
Like a motherfucker.
Like a motherfucker, man.
Hit that fan. All right.
You'll be all right, brother.
I love you, man.
- Yo, Sergeant Miller, how about a speech?
- Come on
They don't pay me
for speeches, little spoon.
- Hey, it's big spoon, man.
- Ain't what I heard.
Peek at you, snuggling.
Sir.
All right. In a few short days,
you guys will be assigned units,
and there you'll go where duty calls.
It's that simple.
So with not much left to say,
I will leave you with the words
of the late, great, Eleanor Roosevelt,
who so eloquently stated,
"The Marines I've seen around this world
"have the cleanest bodies,
"filthiest minds, highest morale...
"and lowest morals
of any group of animals I've ever seen."
Why are you looking at me, man?
Thank God for the United States
Marine Corps!
- Hoorah! Yeah!
- Let's give him one!
Eat up. I'm-a eat.
- What you want?
- Give me a hotdog, big spoon.
All right.
Hey, bring me one.
- Great speech.
- Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Nothing like an Eleanor Roosevelt quote
to get the crowd going.
- "Elyeanor."
- It's Eleanor, baby.
I'm just saying it 'cause he said it.
- Good throw, Jon!
- Hey, nice spiral, baby!
- Kid's got an arm, man!
- Yeah, he does.
Yo, peewee league, man,
that's all I'm saying.
That's a good idea, actually.
- Peewee league. Yeah.
- You think?
I guess it would be good for him
to be around other dads
and stuff while you're away.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
So, yeah.
Yeah, if it makes him happy, yeah.
It'll make him happy. Jon! Hey, Jon!
What do you think about peewee league?
Yeah! Yeah!
- Peewee league?
- Yeah.
- Sold.
- Sold.
Throw me one, Jon.
- Corporal Devin Roberts.
- Mm-hmm.
I'd like to understand the relationship
between you both.
There's not much to understand.
We grew up on the same block.
His parents kicked him out,
my parents took him in,
and right around the time we ran into
things in common, we shipped off.
To war.
To war.
He's my battle buddy.
We kicked in doors together,
we took enemy fire...
It's just not a relationship
you'd understand
if you haven't been through it, I guess.
Well, I've seen it discussed a lot,
so why don't you try me?
- "Discussed a lot."
- Something funny about that?
Just it's different.
Boots on the ground.
Yeah?
Yeah, it's not that,
it's just something you don't discuss.
What you saw.
My name's Gabriel Drummer.
I'm looking for my family.
Oh, well, fucking A.
Look at me. I'm going to show you, okay?
I need you to look at the photo.
Show you this photo, Charles.
This is my wife and son.
Gabriel the archangel.
- Can you look at the photo?
- There you go.
I don't know anything, man.
- Look at the photo, Charles.
- I don't know anything.
Look at it! Do you recognize the faces?
- Ain't nobody here, man.
- Have you seen these people?
- Ain't nobody here, man.
- Yeah, but you.
But you. You're here.
- And now you.
- Hey!
You think I won't kill you?
You think I won't kill you, Charles?
- No.
- No?
I mean, yeah, I'm...
You think I won't kill you? Hmm?
- No.
- Look at me.
Yes. I mean, yes, I will.
Yo, fuck this fool, man.
Let's just take his shit and go.
You need sleep, Charles.
You got shelter around here?
- Charles.
- Answer the question.
Where's home?
Over there.
Get your shit, Charles.
Hey, you almost done, little man?
I'm gonna go outside.
Hey, so I was talking to some of the aides
over at Johnny's school
about the little football program.
Peewee league?
Yeah, they said they're
gonna have it at night
with some other activities
when I'm at work.
That's perfect.
They're already putting together
all these care packages for you,
all kinds of sweet things.
I mean, I'm easy, you know.
Just peanut butter anything, and I'm good.
Right, Jon?
- You all right, pal?
- Yeah.
- Gabe.
- Hey.
Gabe, can I please just
have a minute with you?
Yeah.
What, so you're just going
to pretend like this isn't happening?
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say, Nat.
- I can't be a single mom, Gabe.
- You're not a single mom.
You know, there's a war going on,
I'm not making it up.
It's something we were
both aware of when we signed up.
- When you signed up.
- Okay, Natty.
And what. What does Devin get to do?
Why does he get to stay back,
'cause he broke his arm?
I mean, he gets to stay back for what?
Because we need a presence here as well.
Why? Who the fuck's attacking America?
You're gonna be okay, Nat.
Really?
Afghanistan, Gabe?
You think that I... that I
want to do this,
that this is something I want to do,
like I can't wait to go to war?
You know, I'd love to stay here
and just be here with you, Natty,
but I can't do that.
That's not an option for me.
Man...
I'm sorry.
You know, it's not easy for me, either.
You're mad and he's mad and...
No, I'm sad, and he's fucking sad,
and the whole neighborhood's sad.
Stop. Hey, come on. Stop, Nat.
Natty, I'm sorry.
Come on.
We're gonna be fine.
Hey, we're gonna be fine. Come on.
Don't look at me.
We're gonna be fine.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Hey, bud.
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.
You won't play anymore? Why?
You know, I was thinking about...
I was thinking about...
You know, in the old days,
we used to send letters.
I mean, way back, you know.
It was, like, a big process.
You had to, like, write it by hand.
You had a find a stamp, find a mailbox.
It was just this whole big thing.
Now, we don't have to do that anymore,
'cause now we got email and Skype...
It's almost like
I'm here already, you know?
And before you know it, I will be.
You know?
I could give you something.
Yeah.
What is it?
It's me and Mom.
Oh!
Mom know you have this?
You sneaky little weasel.
I love you, man.
I love you so much.
And when you get there,
will you do that letter thing with me?
Yeah, I'll do the letter thing
as soon as I get there.
Soon as I land,
I'll start with the letter thing.
In hand, every day. All right?
Look at me. Man down.
Man down.
All right.
Last stop.
You know, it was you that got me
into this shit.
Yeah, well, seemed like
a good idea at the time.
Hey, man, you could always
put your arm through a fucking window.
Yeah.
I can't believe this shit.
You're the only family I ever had, man.
All right, don't do that shit now.
Just watch out for mine, all right?
- You know I will.
- I know you will.
All right, send me pictures and...
I know what kind of pictures you want.
Yeah, all right.
Don't be a bitch out there!
You know me.
I don't know where he is...
I don't know where Johnny is.
What'd you say?
Hey, what did you just say?
- What'd you say?
- Nothing. I didn't...
No, you just said "Johnny," man.
You recognize the boy in the photo?
- What?
- My son?
- I don't recognize anyone.
- That's bullshit.
That's bullshit, man. He's lying to you.
He just said Johnny's name.
On my life, he just said
your son's name, man.
He said it.
Let's just get where we're going.
- Hello?
- Devin.
Yo.
- Hey.
- What the fuck...
Hey, sorry I'm calling late, man.
You doing something right now?
- No.
- Can you talk?
- Yeah, man.
- I was trying...
I was trying to get ahold of Natalie,
but I can't get her
on cell or Skype, so...
Yeah, yeah, no, of course, man.
Um... yeah, I think, you know,
I think she's been pretty hectic
with Johnny's, you know, practice,
and working late and whatever, so...
But I can go 'round and check
it out or whatever if you're worried.
- Yeah, can you do that?
- Yeah, man, of course.
- How's Johnny?
- Johnny's great, man.
He's good, yeah. He's killing it.
- Really!
- Man, he's murdering, bro.
Romo's got nothing on that kid, man.
No!
Not that Romo's got anything on anybody,
- you know how it is.
- Yeah.
So, it's pretty fucked up over there, huh?
Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.
But listen, good news.
I'm headed your way,
like, a week from tomorrow.
Get outta here.
- Yeah, for real.
- Wow.
Yeah, I got this thing
off my arm, bro. I'm coming.
That's great.
Yeah.
Anyway, you know,
I just want to thank you
for going to check on things.
Oh, come on, man, of course.
- Yeah.
- Of course.
If you see Natty, tell her I love her.
I will.
Tell her to pick up her cell phone.
- Yeah, okay, man.
- All right.
Your address...
2273 Minnesota Street, is that correct?
Yes, sir.
And that's where your wife
and child reside?
Yes, sir.
I don't really see what that
has to do with anything, sir.
Why you keep looking at that paper.
Would you rather I not?
I don't know.
Is there a reason you
asked about my address?
Just making sure you're you.
Okay.
Am I me?
I believe so.
Why don't we talk about Kamdesh?
I mean, that's the reason
I'm here, isn't it?
Okay.
Kamdesh.
Can they give the shit vehicles
to the Army next time? This is bullshit.
- Machines break down, Marine.
- Yes, they do.
We're all good up here.
This area is secure.
We're at war, Marine. Nothing's secure.
Yes, sir.
Candygram. Trick or treat.
They want a fucking hand delivery.
Yeah, that's why I don't bother.
How's the arm, Roberts?
- It's great.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- You've been whacking it?
How about Drummer?
You been whacking Drummer?
- Yep.
- How we doing down there, Jones?
Two minutes should be good
to pull her out, sir.
Let's keep our heads on, Marines!
Come on, it's candy! Everybody likes it.
They don't like the candy.
I can't get anything out of these kids.
You see him on the second deck?
They say gluten-free.
- Shut the fuck up.
- Just about good here, sir.
These kids must be on
the fucking Atkins Diet, or some shit.
Sir, we're just about good here!
- Sir, I got movement, second deck, 2-7.
- All right, back her up!
Ready to go!
Oh, fuck!
I.E.D.! I.E.D.!
Yeah!
What the fuck!
Pull that 50!
We've got troops in combat!
Troops in combat!
Go, go!
- Take cover!
- Yes, sir!
Pull the pin! Second deck! We're moving!
We're taking it!
Come on, sir!
Fuck!
Backtrack!
What the hell are you doing?
It's a carbine rifle! Fuck!
- Sir!
- Take it!
Keep it coming! Keep it coming!
We're good!
What the fuck.
What the fuck are we doing here?
Set!
Grenade!
Go, go, go!
Is there a reason you
don't want to discuss
what you saw in that room?
- What I saw in the room, sir?
- Experienced.
Gabriel, you've been through
a series of traumatic events.
I don't know.
I prefer if we just move on.
I'll be fine, sir.
I'd assure you, these are things
you do not simply move on from.
What do you suggest that I do, then?
That's what we're here to sort out.
Either way, we have
a mandatory date again.
Yeah, funded by a government who'd
like to see people like me gone.
Gone?
You know, maybe if you looked
into the spiked suicide rates
of military personnel in this country,
you'd know what you're looking for.
And what would that be?
Has that been a problem?
- Gabriel.
- Yes, sir.
You brought up suicide.
Is there a reason you did that?
I don't know.
I just don't want my kid to hurt.
Of course.
You want to kill me, don't you?
I just want to find my son.
You're a Marine, huh?
Hoorah.
You know where my son is, Charles?
I haven't seen anybody.
I'd tell you if I did.
What the fuck is that?
What is that?
There's people in that building.
- Who are they?
- I don't... I don't know. I don't...
- I don't see...
- Are they Americans?
Fuck if I know, man.
They might as well roll
the red carpet out on these borders,
people they let
into this goddamned country.
Holy fuck.
Still not concerned about what
your friend here is up to, huh?
That's a motherfucking cell phone, dog.
Dev, there's people in my building.
- In that building.
- What?
There's people.
You just said there was nobody here.
- There's people in that building.
- Who's over there?
They got kids in the building?
There are kids over there?
What you seeing, Drummer?
- They got kids in that building?
- Where you going?
Hey, motherfucker!
- Where you going, man?
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Where you going? Huh?
- I'm not going anywhere.
He's trying to run, man.
Who are you calling on this phone?
- I'm not calling...
- Who are you calling on this phone?
What?
- What is this?
- What do you see?
- What did you see, Drummer?
- How did you get this?
Are there kids over there?
How did you get this envelope?
How did you get this envelope?
- Listen, I don't know.
- How did you get this envelope?
It's an envelope addressed to my kid.
My fucking envelope.
- How do you have this envelope?
- It's addressed to Johnny?
What do you know about that?
- My envelope, it's not.
- What? What?
It's my envelope. How the fuck
did you have my envelope?
Wait, wait, wait! Fuck!
No!
Go left!
- To the right!
- Overhead check clear!
Team 4, Team 4!
We're moving to the second deck!
We'll take them!
So...
I'd like to discuss,
if you would, the incident.
I'd like to start
from your... your point of entry...
what you saw and what you experienced.
It was you and Corporal Devin Roberts.
Corporal Roberts, myself,
Second Lieutenant Taylor.
We entered the first floor,
cleared and neutralized
the first floor, and then...
We went to the second floor.
Where there was a room.
Yes, sir.
On the fucking ground!
On the ground! On the ground!
- Clear left! Shit.
- On the ground!
Boys, move it closer!
Come down! Get down! Get down!
On the ground! Get on the ground!
Hey, hey, come on! Get on the ground.
Roberts! Roberts! Hey, take a breath.
- Down. Down. On the ground.
- Are we clear?
Yeah, we're clear right! On the ground.
On the ground! Don't come at me.
Get on the ground.
Shit.
Shh. Down. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Drummer, we got this. Check that room!
Roger.
Keep time.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get off me! Get on the ground.
- Are we clear?
- Clear, Roberts.
It's okay. Hey. Hey.
- It's okay.
- Nice and easy.
Lance Corporal, are we clear?
- Drummer, are we clear?
- All clear!
Room's clear, just checking on dead.
I haven't checked those
motherfuckers over there yet.
- Oh, he's good.
- He's good.
Jesus Christ. Look at this fucking shit.
Flat screens...
Blue diamond... this is big bear actual,
building secure, four insurgents down.
Requesting immediate guys evac, over.
Gun! Down!
Come on.
Oh, fuck.
- You see that?
- I'm on it.
- Drummer.
- Little joy.
So...
About the incident.
You keep calling it "the incident."
How does it make you feel?
It makes me feel like shit.
Let's write that down.
Does that work?
I'm sorry, sir.
I felt betrayed.
Betrayed?
Yeah, I think if it was anybody but him,
I wouldn't feel like that.
It was him.
I see.
I... I thought we were talking
about the incident in the room.
What you call it... What is it?
You keep going back to that incident.
I thought the room was clear.
The room was clear.
Gun! Down!
Goddamn it! Fuck!
What the fuck...
Oh, fuck.
I got a civilian.
Oh, Dev.
Dev. Dev, I...
Dev. Dev.
Fuck. Where?
Corpsman up!
Johnny's great.
I need a fucking corpsman now!
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Fight, Dev! Fight, motherfucker, fight!
It was good to talk to you.
I can't wait to see you.
We'll see.
All clear!
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I thought the area was secure.
I thought it was clear. It wasn't.
There was a mother and a son in there,
and I can't take that back, you know?
I can't rewind, you know. It's just...
just one of them things.
Hey!
Johnny, let's go!
Hey, baby, let's go! I'm serious!
Gabe.
- Oh, my.
- Daddy!
Hey... hey, go back upstairs, okay?
Mommy's gotta talk...
Go back upstairs now!
Hey, baby...
Please...
Oh, my God.
I just feel like I'm dead, sir.
I don't give a shit anymore.
You think about dying often?
Oh, man, you just keep...
You know, I can't...
I'm sorry, sir, I can't do this anymore.
- Gabriel.
- I'm just trying to talk to you.
What is the right answer, "yes"?
Write "yes". What's the right answer?
Write the right answer.
Just give me the right answer.
- I'll say whatever you want me to say.
- The emails.
Did you know before or after the incident?
You keep calling it the fucking incident.
You keep going back
to that fucking incident.
The fact that another Marine was present at
the time is understandably cause for concern.
You need a fall guy.
That's what this is.
You just need a fall guy.
No, that's your paranoia speaking.
There's no agenda here.
I'm simply trying
to understand what happened.
You can't understand what happened.
You will never understand
what I'm going through.
- Maybe.
- No, not maybe.
No, maybe I can understand guilt.
I can understand regret.
I can understand betrayal.
These are all human conditions.
Now, you brought up suicide before,
and that concerns me.
Do you want to kill yourself, Gabriel?
Do you really want to kill yourself?
Yes.
Then what stops you?
This.
Pop the trunk.
So, what happens now,
I go home with this letter
that says I was weak
and I couldn't handle it,
- and everything's just fine again?
- No.
Again, no.
I'd like to offer up a few suggestions
toward dealing with
those feelings, if I may.
They're not feelings, sir. They're real.
What happened in that room is real.
What happened with my wife is real.
Listen, that's an important statement
you just made.
The physical world isn't a lie, Gabriel.
You believed the room was clear.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
It's not worth it.
They say 90% of people
supposedly regret it the second they jump.
Where they fuck they
got that statistic, I don't know.
Make it up.
Word is, they could
strike anytime, anywhere.
War's coming home.
No one called me.
What do you think I'm doing here?
Mom.
I don't know. What are you doing here?
Gabe!
- Listen...
- But, Mom, he's here.
I'll come get you in a second. Go on.
They're setting up
intelligence at our old base.
- That doesn't trouble you?
- What troubles me is
I got a mound of paperwork
saying I'm mentally incompetent.
That troubles me a fuck ton.
That got you home, didn't it?
Look, I don't care
what they say about you.
All right, this is end-of-the-world,
neck-deep-in-shit stuff.
- I need you in it.
- I'm done.
- You're never done.
- I'm done, Dev.
Your first meeting back will be critical.
For Jonathan.
And you.
I'd like to talk about
what you'll be returning to stateside.
I mean, I know what I'm returning to.
Yes, but in case it isn't
what you are expecting or hoping for.
I'm not hoping for anything.
I'm responsible for these
terrible things I can't change.
Hey, Gabe.
I just don't want the kid to hurt.
You know?
Hey.
Gabe, I need you to talk to him.
Okay.
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I mean, it's fine if you
need to punish me still,
- but I need you to...
- I'm not punishing you.
Tell me what...
Tell me what to do.
Take off your shirt.
Really?
Okay.
Okay.
Is this what you want?
No.
What can I do?
Nothing.
My watch says seven.
What's your world clock say?
- Seven.
- Seven.
Well, I guess our time is up, sir.
I have nowhere to be.
Would you like to continue?
Your time is up, my time is up,
but thank you for yours.
Drummer. Yo, Drummer, you copy?
Yes, sir.
The medication will be helpful.
It's gonna take a lot more than that
to get you through this.
There's no getting through
this, sir, admit it.
Gabe!
- Go back inside. Go back in side.
- But, Mommy, he's here.
I'll come get you in a second. Go on.
Why do they give a shit about me?
They don't give a shit about me,
I don't give a shit about them, you know?
Gabe.
We can make this work.
Come on, please.
Nat!
Where's my kid?
I'm not gonna talk
to you if you don't calm down.
You're not gonna what?
I'm not gonna talk to you
if you don't calm down.
I'm calm. Get my kid out here now.
- Gabe, keep your voice down, please.
- Nat, I wanna see my kid.
I know what they're doing
with the kids in school.
I wanna see my child.
I want to see my kid now!
I'm on the phone with the police
'cause you're scaring our kid.
- Johnny!
- Stop. Calm the fuck down.
- I wanna see my...
- Gabe, fucking stop! Stop!
I want to see my kid!
I'm a United States Marine.
I want to see my son!
I know what's happening to kids
inside the school. I see 'em lining up.
I want to see my fucking child!
Jon is in trouble.
Gabe, stop! Stop!
- Stop, Gabe!
- What'd you see, Drummer?
I need the police. My husband's got a gun
- and he's going to my kid's school.
- What's over there?
What do I do?
- Who are you?
- Answer the question.
- Who are you?
- Charles, my name's Charles.
Hoorah.
How did you get this envelope?
It's an envelope
addressed to my kid.
It's my fucking envelope.
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- How did you get this fucking envelope?
They're not feelings, sir. They're real.
What happened in that room is real.
What happened with my wife is real.
Gabriel.
Devin, I'm at the back entrance.
I'm going in.
Hey, pal. Hey, it's Pop. You okay?
- Daddy.
- Yeah.
I need you to be quiet.
We're gonna get out of
this place now, all right?
- Okay? You trust me?
- Yeah. Yeah.
I trust you. Come on, be a big boy now.
Here we go. Up.
Daddy. Daddy.
Hold on.
Dev, made contact. Coming out.
- Johnny!
- Back, back, back, back.
All right, you're okay. Come on.
Johnny!
- Watch your footing.
- Gabe!
He's shooing in the house.
He's got my son.
He's got my son. What do I do?
Police!
- Shit!
- Daddy!
Shots fired!
Go back in!
You're okay. Okay. You're okay.
All right, we'll go over here.
I'm going to go. Stay right there.
- You okay, buddy? Huh? You okay?
- Yeah.
Remember whatever happens,
you'll be fine, you understand?
Dev, come in, Dev. Dev!
The fucking thing, man.
What's wrong with you?
I'm scared.
Hey, no, you're not.
Huh?
- Okay?
- Yeah.
It's all right.
Don't cry. You'll be fine. Okay?
Yeah.
You're gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.
Johnny, you'll be fine.
Yeah.
You know, I got something for you, too.
Here. Remember that?
- Who's that?
- It's me and Mom.
She's your mom.
She's my everything.
She's your mom.
That's my everything.
Yeah.
That's my everything.
Jon, you'll be fine.
Be strong. I got you, son.
Police! Come out!
Go! Go! Go!
What's that?
Gummy bears.
Your favorite candy, right?
That's your favorite candy.
Yeah.
See, I remember.
- Is that your favorite candy, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- The red ones, right?
Johnny's favorite candy.
- Hmm?
- Yeah.
You eat them red ones.
I'll be back in five seconds, okay?
- Say, "Yeah, Dad, I understand."
- Yeah, Dad I understand.
- Police, don't move!
- Daddy!
Daddy!
Johnny, don't look!
- Johnny, don't look!
- Daddy!
Gabriel! Gabriel!
How do you know my name?
How do you know my name?
Drummer, we got this. Check the last room.
Okay. You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?
Devin, Team 2 here, Dev.
Dev, are you tracking me? Dev!
I'm in deep shit here. Do you copy?
Dev, do you... Fuck.
We're okay. We're okay.
Yeah.
I don't even have the doctor's number.
- Who are you?
- He's here. He's here.
Who are you? Who are you?
Stay right there, Jon.
- Who are you?
- It's me.
Who are you?
Who are you talking to?
It's me.
Mom.
I know what you're doing to the kids.
My kid was with his mother. Where is she?
Where is she?
It's me.
You aren't...
Gabe.
Where is she? Where's my kid's mother?
Where is she? Where is she? Down.
Get down, get down, get down.
Where's my wife?
Natalie Drummer is my wife.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Gabriel.
- Where is she?
- No, Gabriel...
Where is she?
- Where is she?
- I'm right here!
- Where is she?
- I'm right here.
- Natalie Drummer, where is she?
- Gabriel, please.
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is my fucking wife?
Don't. No, no, no.
Don't.
They're not feelings, sir. They're real.
What happened in that room is real.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay, Dad.
I didn't mean it.
I didn't know.
I was confused. I was confused.
I didn't know. I didn't know.
Natty, I'm sorry.
I was confused.
I didn't... I didn't... I didn't...
You know, I was thinking about...
I was thinking about...
You know, in the old days,
we used to send letters.
I wrote these for you.
It was, like, a big process, you know?
It was, like, impossible.
You had to, like, write it by hand.
So now we got email and Skype...
It's almost like
I'm here already, you know?
No!
I'm ain't Mom, but I damn
sure am gonna tell my kid
I love him when he gets
out the car, all right?
- Yeah.
- So we gotta come up with
some kind of little middle ground,
like a secret word or something.
What about "man down"?
- Man down?
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah, I like that.
- I like it, too.
Damn sure is manly enough.
You know? Nobody will know what we're
talking about when we say it.
So anytime I want to say I love you,
what am I going to say to you?
- Man down.
- All right, good.
All right, get out the car.
No! Johnny, no!
Hey, man down.
Man down.
You little cowboy, go ahead.
Have a good day, bud.
You too.
I love you.
How much?
