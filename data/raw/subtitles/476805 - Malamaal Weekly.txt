Listen, my beloved.
Listen, my beloved.
Listen, my beloved.
Listen, my beloved.
At the river bed, there
is one village.
Once there was such a storm.
That the shade of the
peepal tree was lost.
Listen, joy and sorrow
are a part of life.
'From here Laholi begins.'
'Lt is a small village
of 100-150 fields.'
'People here are quite na? I? Ve.'
'They lead a simple life.'
'Today in the lap of Manjira, the
water jumps like a naughty child.'
'The fields are lush.'
'But a few years ago,
it was barren.'
'Along with the water of Manjira...
...the sun had converted the happiness
of the villagers into steam.'
'People first sold their vessels...
then their jewelries.'
'At last the matter reached
to their house and land.'
'Boons were asked at temples.'
'At church, people kneeled
down like a stick.'
'But no God kept the hand of
blessings of the cloud on their head.'
'Only one hand came forward.'
'The village's Thakur's
wife's hand.'
'Not one, but she forwarded
both her hands.'
'Lf she distributed from one hand...
...then she gathered
from the other hand.'
'The villagers would mortgage
their houses and fields...
...to the Thakur's wife for money...
...and thus make both
their ends meet.'
'The Thakur's wife splurged
the whole village's wealth.'
'Then only did God open His eyes.'
'Then once again the
clouds gathered...
...and the water showered.'
'Manjira was filled with waves.'
'And the fields were again lush.'
'But Saturn didn't move from
the villager's horoscope.'
'The account of the Thakur's
wife is such that...
...forget taking back
the mortgaged land...
...nobody could even pay
the interest till now.'
'Nobody was free from the loan.'
'Now no festival is celebrated
in the village.'
'People crave for the sweets
during the weddings.'
'And God craves for the offerings.'
'Only the Thakur's wife
gets the offering.'
Baje!
'He is Baje, meaning Baj Bahadur.'
'The only real brother
of the Thakur's wife.'
'And the only alive relative
of the Thakur's wife.'
'He doesn't work, he
only does tricks.'
'At times even Leelaram is fooled.'
'But still he is proud that he is
the only person in the village...
...who has touched the threshold
of the college.'
'But his studies weren't
of much use.'
'He couldn't get a job.'
'Lt's not that he didn't
get a chance.'
'When he did get a chance,
then Leela...
...let that opportunity
slip from his hands.'
We've come here to record the
census of the population.
You're the only educated
person in this village.
So we give you this job.
What will I have to do?
You have to ask each
woman of the house...
...how many family members there are.
Whether they are married,
how many kids they have.
You have to write down the answers
of these questions...
...along with the house number
and give it to me.
That's it.
Fine.
What happened?
I want to ask you some questions...
...to know the census
of the population.
Are you married?
- No.
No. How many children do you have?
- Shameless!
Stupid! You should first have asked
how many children you have!
Greetings.
I want to ask you some questions...
...to know the census
of the population.
Do you have children?
- Yes.
How many?
- 6.
6. Are you married?
- Shameless!
'So when a person is unsuccessful
in finding...
...a white collar job, he starts the
business of selling the lottery.'
'Lt helps to make both
the ends meet.'
'The second special person
of the village is Balwant.'
'Balwant has magic.'
'From 20, 18 of his cows are
mortgaged to the Thakur's wife.'
'And Balwant supplies the milk
obtained from just 2 cows...
...to the whole village.'
'Some unlucky people who are
jealous of his decent...
...earnings say that Balwant sells
more water and less milk.'
'But nobody has the courage
to say this on his face.'
'Because Balwant is famous
for his bravery.'
'That incident was like this... '
What happened? What happened?
Help!
Are you all fools!
Why did you all allow the child
to venture so near to the well!
Help!
Throw the rope!
Father!
Pull!
Use your strength! Fools!
Hail Ballu! Hail Ballu! Hail Ballu!
Who pushed him! Who pushed him!
Hail Ballu! Hail Ballu! Hail Ballu!
'Whoever that person is.'
'But there is one person in this
village who loathes Balwant.'
'And he is Kanhaiya.'
'Ln spite of hating him
he is Balwant's servant.'
'And he works for free and
endures his abuses. Why? '
'Because this is the only
way to meet his childhood...
...sweetheart Sukhmani everyday.'
'So let us have a look at
the story of this village.'
Last night the village head
divided Chaudhary's house.
Yes.
- Everything was fine. - Yes.
But where were you?
I'd gone to Satpur, to sell
the lottery ticket.
I'd left early in the morning
and I came home late at night.
So your business is increasing.
What are you saying?
Selling lottery tickets
is not very lucrative.
Only when somebody wins
do I get 10o/o commission.
Otherwise it is nothing.
Last year, Birju Lohar
won 500 rupees. - Yes.
Then only did I get a commission
of 50 rupees.
That's it. After that
there hasn't been much.
Your business is good.
If you don't earn by selling milk...
...then at least you can drink
milk and satiate your hunger.
You are the lucky one.
- How?
A person will not stop running
after his destiny.
And your lottery business
will close down.
People will continue
to buy the lottery...
...with the hope that some
day they will win.
Look at it this way.
Look, that Thakur's
wife in the vehicle.
Stop! Where are you going!
Laxman!
- Yes.
Who told you to give water
to this unlucky female!
Since the last 3 months she
has not repaid her loan!
I'm pregnant, Thakur's wife.
If you are pregnant
then go and abort it.
Go and do some work and
give me the money.
She is a wicked woman!
- Wicked woman! Good one!
Where were you since the past
3 days? - I... father! Father!
Hey! Come here! Come!
I toil in the sun and bring the
water! And you waste water!
Now why don't you answer me!
Has the snake bitten you!
Is there a treasure
buried in the ground!
Go and get 3 packs of cotton
from Sukhmani. - Okay.
Hey, Sukh! Come down!
- What happened?
Come down!
Give me a kiss! - What are you
doing! Father is outside!
Father! He himself said to take it!
What! Father said it!
Not possible! Go away!
If he himself says, will you listen?
Then see for yourself. Hang on!
Sir!
- Hey! What are you doing!
Sir, shall I take it
from Sukhmani! Move!
Yes, I told you to take it!
Why are you asking!
Saw that! Saw that! Sir,
she is refusing!
Father, you said it!
Yes! - Really? - Why are
you asking so much!
Saw that! Now come on! Hurry up.
One more!
- No, go away.
Hey! Sir, Sukhmani gave just one!
Why are you measuring it so much!
It is not some gold or silver!
Give him 3! 3!
3. Give it! Hurry up!
One more!
- No! Now you go!
Fine, I'll ask once more! Sir...
Kanhaiya, tell me one thing.
How did you coax father!
Stop this rubbish!
Scoundrel! Idiot! And you shameless!
But father... you only had said.
I told you to give him cotton
and you're kissing him!
Wait, idiot!
You don't have money
in your pocket...
...and you want to love my daughter!
Hey! Why are you running, Kanhaiya!
Father, you too run! Ballu
is after me with the knife!
Why!
- He has gone mad!
I will handle the son later! First
I'll strangulate the father!
I don't have the money
to buy the betel leaf!
Then how can I repay your
1000 rupees loan!
And what is the use of running!
What is the use of running!
Fool! If I sell your empty skull
to the black magic fellow...
...in the graveyard then
I will get 2000 rupees.
I will at least recover some money.
Scoundrel! Do you sell milk or
water! You are a filthy man!
My Kanha has been serving
you since so many years...
...and what do you give him!
You are a thief! A wicked man!
I pray to God that your cow starts
giving water instead of milk!
And you drown in that water!
You are acting like a King, sitting
on the elephant, you pauper!
Come down! Come down! You idiot!
When your feet will
land on the ground...
...that day will be the
last day of your life!
You bat!
Hey, Bhima! Why are you yelling!
When the elephant goes
to the market...
...thousands of dogs bark.
Give me the way, Mangalia
want to go.
Move! Come on, Mangalia!
Come on, Mangalia!
You don't have the money
to repay my loan!
And you can afford a conductor
for the elephant.
The complainant is Satpur village's
Sutar Govind-bhai.
And the accuser is Lahori's Gulu.
Gulu met Rani in the market.
Both of them fell in love.
And Gulu promised Rani
that he will marry her.
Now Rani is now pregnant.
And Gulu is refusing to marry Rani.
You want this only to happen
that Gulu should marry Rani.
This won't happen.
I don't want to be the father
of another's child.
Gulu, you keep quiet. Let the
village committee do their work.
What is the proof that Gulu
is Rani's child's father?
Proof? From where do
we get the proof?
My daughter is saying the truth.
Yes. In these matters, a woman's
word is the proof.
Look at that! Now the
men are in trouble.
Tomorrow any female will point
her fingers on a young...
...man like me, then will
I marry and be ruined!
Silence! Silence!
I can't force Gulu to marry just on
the basis of your daughter's word.
The village committee is dismissed.
Gulu, you are free now.
Is this called justice!
This is my decision!
And my decision is the decision...
...of the village committee!
Then listen to my decision too!
I will get Gulu and Rani married
in the next full moon night.
If Gulu comes for the
wedding, then fine.
Otherwise we'll kill him!
If you are a true man,
then try to kill him!
If any person from Lahori
entered this village...
...then there will be bloodshed!
You too hear me!
If any person from Satpur
eyed anybody...
...there will be corpses everywhere!
Get lost! We'll see what you can do!
Come on! I will thrash all
of you with the shoes!
You all scoundrels!
Let's go, Gulu! Let's
see what they do!
Pandey, one glass.
- Yes.
People drink tea during the
day and you drink alcohol.
Anthony-bhai, this intoxication
ruined your house...
...field, harvest, everything.
Now at least come to your senses.
You had such glory once upon a time.
Even ma'am was jealous of you.
Neither wife nor children.
What will I do by saving the money?
And why do you worry.
Do I drink from your father's money?
Gulu.
- Yes. - Begin the work. - Yes.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Can't you see it, you blind man!
He drenched you completely!
Do one thing, Chunni. Go and clean
it in that restroom. Go.
You guys give her the water.
Go and clean it. Go.
Let them come! I will bash them!
They can't see anybody
walking on the road!
Hey, Pandey! One tea!
Come! Come!
Greetings, aunty!
- Greetings.
Wait!
- Let me also see.
All filthy people!
Greetings, aunty!
Tara, I'm leaving!
There is not even a morsel at
home. But what do you care!
You are going with your umbrella!
At least there is water at home.
Yes, plenty of water.
Shall I drown in that?
Did you forget!
There used to be a time when there...
...used to be no water at home.
And today when we have it,
there is no value.
Make water's lentil,
rice and vegetable.
We'll eat it with water.
Should I give water to Gattu too?
He is my only child. But
nobody pampers him.
At least worry a bit about him.
What is the use of yelling
at me! Pray to God!
Somebody should win at least
2000-3000 rupees...
...lottery in this village.
Then I'll get a commission
of 200-300 rupees.
It is fine if we don't
get food to eat then.
But your Gattu won't starve!
Gattu! Gattu!
My son is a burden on me!
Leela! Leela! Look,
I've won a lottery.
All the words are the
same! Have a look!
Not words, the numbers! Illiterate!
Your lottery has 666 and the
English version has 999.
It is wrong.
If we reverse it, it
will be the same.
If we reverse the ticket the
number too will change! Fool!
How! If I hang myself upside
down on the tree...
...still I will remain
the same person, Leela!
So how can these words change!
You illiterate!
I am trying to explain and
you can't understand!
You have not won the lottery! And
this is last month's ticket!
How many times I've said to tear
and throw away the old ticket!
Fool! Reverse the number!
The bat doesn't become a peacock
by turning it upside down!
'On behalf of Malamaal lottery,
you all are welcomed.'
Pandey, tea.
'We've again come to awaken
your sleeping destiny.'
This lottery is useless!
Which number comes and which goes!
All this is not my cup of tea!
You are the only one
who knows everything!
'And now time for the bumper prize.'
'The first prize of Malamaal
lottery is 1 crore.'
'And the number is PA 13765.'
'All lucky winners are... '
Take tea. What happened?
Did anybody won?
No. Nobody received anything.
Your tea.
- No, tea.
Come on! Come on!
You are a dirty child. You
don't want to take bath.
Tara! Tara! Tara!
Tara! Bring water! Bring water!
Here. What happened? Are you fine?
Give me more.
What happened? Tell me.
I'll tell you. Come here. Come.
Listen... I will tell you a secret.
Don't say it to anybody.
What?
Last week the lottery ticket that
I'd sold in the village...
...from that somebody has
won the first prize.
First prize.
- Really? - Yes.
Who is that lucky person?
- I don't know.
And nobody in the village knows.
And if I don't write this
number on the board...
...then nobody will come to know.
Write.
- No. No. I won't write.
Just imagine. So much money.
What if we get the whole
lottery prize?
How is this possible? How can
another's wealth be ours?
It is not another's wealth.
It is ours only.
If I had not sold the
ticket then how would...
...he have had purchased.
I sold only then he bought it.
Otherwise what would he
had bought, pumpkin!
And you know, how much
the prize is? - Yes,
1 crore.
- Oh God! So much of money!
Keep quiet.
Before anybody comes to know,
we have to seize the money.
Understood!
How?
I have an idea.
In the past 1 year, nobody has
won a lottery in this village.
To lift the spirit of the villagers,
I will invite them for a feast.
The one who shows the ticket,
he will eat.
And the one who doesn't show the
ticket, he will get nothing.
We don't have the money
for the feast.
There is no money...
There is no money.
But there is a way.
But you don't be angry.
Look, what I'm doing, it is
for our own good. - Yes.
You only think.
If we call 100-125 people
for the feast...
...the expense will amount
to 800-900 rupees.
Am I right?
- Yes.
Is there anything left in
our house to sell? - No.
There is. There is. There is one
thing. But you don't be angry.
Now do say.
What if we mortgaged our Gattu
to that wicked woman?
No, no. Never! I don't
want any money.
I can't sell my child. Do you
have a heart or a stone?
How can you even think of this?
You think that I don't
love my Gattu?
No, you don't. Otherwise you
wouldn't have had said this.
It is just a matter of a few days.
We will mortgage Gattu today.
Tomorrow we will organize the feast.
And by day after tomorrow, we'll
receive the lottery money.
And after that Gattu
will again play here.
And I'm mortgaging Gattu
only for Gattu's good.
This is the time to think, Tara...
not cry. Think. Think.
Think about it.
What should I do with this?
Do a show? You only keep it.
I am famished, ma'am.
Now I don't have the energy
left to play it.
Give whatever you want.
- Give him 5 rupees.
Feast and that too in our village?
Are you jesting?
The whole village knows
and you don't know?
But from where did Leela uncle
get so much of money?
Did he rob somebody?
I don't know. Your father
is not invited? - No.
Did he buy the ticket?
- No.
Father says, buying a ticket
means a blind man...
...shooting a dumb man an
arrow in the darkness.
That's why!
Those who have bought the ticket,
all of them are invited.
There is going to be wheat
pancakes and sweets.
There is a drama too.
Our villagers are furtive people.
They say that they don't have
the money to buy peanuts.
And they are going to
dance in the drama.
Tell me who had worn what jewelries.
Yes. Yes. This is 6.
Hurry up. It is so late.
Another 2...
Hey! Stop! Stop! I will pluck
out your eyes! Fool!
He ruined your attires completely.
There is a restroom there. Go
and clean it there. Go, go.
Come, Neeru.
- Go! You brute! Aren't you ashamed!
Hey, why are you standing here?
Some idiot splashed muddy
water on Sukhmani.
She is cleaning there.
Fool! Idiot!
Let me see it!
Scoundrel!
You raised your hands on me!
Scoundrel!
I will pluck out your eyes!
I will kill you!
Let me see!
- Don't let him go!
Leave him!
Scoundrel! Why are you
jealous when I see her!
I will pluck out your eyes
if you ogle at her!
She is my to-be wife!
You are just a servant!
Nobody honors a servant!
Let it be!
You fool! I love Sukhmani
since the time I was born!
I will marry her!
I am the only eligible bachelor
in this village.
Let me see who marries Sukhmani!
I will marry her!
- Leave it!
I will set the whole village ablaze!
Go home. Leave this quarrel!
Why are you fighting?
- You both go home.
Yes. Come. Come.
- Go!
You too come soon, brother.
You won't benefit from this land.
Within 6 months it will become
barren. It is futile to buy it.
Accountant, break the deal.
Sister! Sister! I want
marry right now.
Baje, look at yourself.
What happened? - Love.
When? - Half an hour back. And
I want to marry right now.
Don't jump like a monkey.
There is no girl, no auspicious
time, no wedding procession...
...how will you marry?
Sukhmani.
- What? - Yes.
That milkman's daughter?
- Yes.
Have you gone mad!
You will get only cow dung
and grass as dowry.
I will find a wealthy girl for you.
I don't want anything!
I just want Sukhmani!
Useless fellow!
I have raised you up by feeding
you milk and almond!
How will I recover my money!
Look, why haven't I
married hitherto...
...because I don't want
to share my wealth.
And you! You want to marry a pauper!
You didn't even match the horoscope!
What horoscope! I am head over
heels in love with that girl!
Ma'am, he has raised the
topic at the right time.
The Goddess will enter the house.
Ma'am, you? And in this
poor man's house.
My house has become pure.
Come. Come in.
What's the use? I have come
here for some reason.
Tell me, ma'am.
My brother Baj Bahadur
likes your daughter.
He wants to marry her. Balwant,
you are fortunate.
Be thankful to God. No dowry,
no good looks.
And on top of that
the increasing age.
I will talk to the pundit in a few
days and fix the marriage date.
Do you accept it?
Accept? Ma'am, I can't
even believe it.
My luck has awakened.
I will not find such a nice
alliance even if I try my best.
Fine, fine.
So accept this.
Ma'am! Stop! Bless the
girl and then go.
Sukhi! Sukhi! Sukhi!
Know that whatever I do,
it is for your own good.
I will not marry that fool!
Then will you sit here forever
as a noose around my neck.
Since the past 3-4 years...
...I have been saying
that your age is 21.
How long will I be able
to hide this lie?
As you are getting older, I
am getting sleepless nights.
Pity your old father.
But that useless fellow
has made you senseless.
And he is 1 year younger to you too.
No money and no land.
He takes an off every other
day during the monsoon.
Why? Because he has just one
coat and it has not dried.
The elephant is mortgaged
to that woman.
Only 4 hens are left. Will
you be happy in that hut?
Every man is the same
after marriage.
There is no difference.
Look, dear. I am your real father.
I want you to be happy.
If you become madam's
daughter-in-law...
...you will rule the entire village.
Rule!
Turn! Turn
Go ahead. We don't give alms!
No, Balwant. I have
made a good decision.
To repay my loan?
Yes. But for that there
is a proposal.
I'm giving you my son.
- Meaning.
Meaning, my son is ready
to marry your daughter.
And even you give your consent.
So you will have to
give us the dowry.
Nowadays such hale and hearty...
...young guys are worth
20,000 rupees.
And 2 kilos of gold.
It will be too much
for you. No problem.
I will reduce 5000. You can
give me 15,000 rupees.
How much is your loan? 6000 rupees.
Deducting 6,000 rupees, you
can give me 9,000 rupees.
Am I right? So my loan
will be repaid.
And you will get such a nice
groom for your daughter.
Is it acceptable to you?
Fool! You have nothing
in your house...
...and you have come to ask
for my daughter's alliance!
Wait! If I don't shoot both the
father and the son's skull...
...then my name is not...
He has gone mad! Mangal,
run! Mangal, run!
Mangal, run! He will hit stone!
He has gone mad!
You fool, wait!
'Kanhaiya... I had hopes
that some day...
...father will give his consent
for our marriage.'
'But today when he accepted
ma'am alliance...
...then my hopes crashed.'
'So we'll elope.'
'Tonight at 11:30 meet me at the
road going towards Satpur.'
'I will wait for you there.'
Neeru.
Give this to your brother. And
nobody should come to know.
Sukhmani.
This world is the puppet of fate.
It is all the game of fate.
This world is the puppet of fate.
It is all the game of fate.
I have come as your good luck.
Have a relation with me.
Make me yours, hide
me in your heart.
Make a move and take the risk.
Embrace me, make me yours.
Take the pleasure of my
intoxication, lock eyes with me.
I am quite expensive.
Let's see who gets me.
In the crowd of hordes of people.
Whose luck will shine?
Apart from me, there is nothing.
Good luck is where I am.
Come, my beloved.
Make me yours, hide
me in your heart.
Make a move and take the risk.
Embrace me, make me yours.
Take the pleasure of my
intoxication, lock eyes with me.
I am the love that
eyes search for.
I am the shower of happiness.
If you grab hold of me.
I am the sharp sword.
I have no control over myself.
Now I'm here, later I'm there.
Come, my beloved.
Make me yours, hide
me in your heart.
Make a move and take the risk.
Embrace me, make me yours.
Take the pleasure of my
intoxication, lock eyes with me.
This world is the puppet of fate.
It is all the game of fate.
I have come as your good luck.
Have a relation with me.
Make me yours, hide
me in your heart.
Make a move and take the risk.
Embrace me, make me yours.
Take the pleasure of my
intoxication, lock eyes with me.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Did you find it?
- What?
The ticket with 1 crore's prize.
I'd sold 105 tickets and
I got only 104 tickets.
One ticket has not arrived. That
must be the prize ticket.
Who didn't come for the feast?
What do I know who that person is!
But he must have found out that
he has won the lottery.
That's why he didn't turn up.
Who could that be?
- Anybody.
From 105, it could be anybody.
I don't know.
Because of your greed
we lost what we had.
Now arrange for 1000 rupees
from somewhere...
...and bring back my Gattu.
I don't want 1 crore! I just
want my child! Do you hear?
Yes.
I came to know. Who won the prize...
I found out. - Who?
Anthony.
That drunkard?
- Yes.
He always buys the ticket from me.
And he only didn't
come for the feast.
He is the only one.
Is any meal left?
Everything is over.
They just pounced on the food.
I have kept the sweet for you.
Tie it. Tie it and give it
to me. Tie and give me.
Anthony-bhai! Anthony-bhai!
'People of Delhi were
finally at rest.'
Anthony-bhai!
Today there was a feast at my place.
You might not be aware of that.
All those people who
buy tickets had come.
But you didn't come.
But you always buy ticket from me.
That's why I have got
some sweets for you.
Can I come in?
Anthony-bhai, so late in the night...
...I have come to give
you good news that...
...your lottery ticket has won
the first prize of 1 crore.
But I think you know
this from before.
You know it, right?
Here, have the sweet
and be happy. Take.
By the way 1 crore is a huge amount.
Don't forget my commission,
Anthony-bhai.
I take at least 10o/o commission
but from you I...
...will be taking only 5o/o because
you are from the village.
Are you feeling it is too much?
Then fine. It is your wish.
See, don't refuse. At least respect
the sweet, Anthony-bhai.
2. Now don't say 1.
This won't be fair.
You will have to give
me at least 50000.
Anthony-bhai! Anthony-bhai!
Anthony-bhai.
Anthony-bhai.
Anthony-bhai!
You? You... what are you doing here?
I... I have come to get the
loan that I had given back.
What are you doing here?
I...
Hey! What happened to Anthony-bhai?
Oh God!
You killed him by strangling
his neck.
No. No!
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.
- I don't want to hear anything.
I will call people. Hey people!
Will you kill me too?
- No!
I haven't killed anyone, Ballu.
He has won the first prize
of 'Malamaal Weekly'...
...and that too of one crore rupees.
And you killed him for that amount?
I haven't killed anyone.
I came here to congratulate him
on winning the first prize.
But I think he knew about
that from before.
So he died out of happiness.
I have seen people laughing
out of happiness but...
...never have I seen people
dying out of happiness.
Hey Leela, I haven't lost my senses.
How did your veil become
the noose of his neck?
I was trying to take the
ticket from his hands.
By putting your veil around
his neck. - No!
When I came here to congratulate...
...him then he was dead from before.
Lord Ram, didn't want that he must...
...get the happy news of
him winning the prize.
The same Lord Ram sent both of
us at the same time over here.
So this is Lord Ram's wish that
we share the prize money.
Understood?
So 50 lakhs is yours. And
whatever remains is mine.
Understood?
Look Ballu, the entire life of
mine I have spent in poverty.
At least I will be rich
when I die. Fine?
And you?
You can get your daughter
married with pomp and show.
And you will get yourself
married twice.
You are still young, Ballu.
Understood?
And look, look it will be a sin.
If we refuse the offering
from Lord...
...Ram then it will be a huge sin.
Who knows? Who knows?
Who knows about this fact
apart from the both of us?
We will say that we are the
owners of the lottery ticket.
That's it. Yes!
But won't this be wrong?
- Why will this be wrong?
Are we robbing? This is
not a case of murder.
And the lottery guy has to pay
off the money to someone.
Then? Why should we let it go?
And it is our right? Isn't it?
And what will we do
of this dead body?
That Sambhu and his wife
have seen me coming here.
Oh! So even I have announced...
...to Saturam that I
will be coming here.
We will get stuck in the
police issue very badly.
Then what should we do now?
Why are you staring?
We will do one thing.
We will very secretly go and throw
this dead body in the river.
The villagers will think
that he must...
...have drowned after drinking a lot.
Fine.
Come, Ballu.
The heavy part of his
body is towards me.
What should I do about that?
I will hang it.
Come on. Carry it.
You sell milk and you have
no strength. Carry it!
Leela, you are also turning pale.
What does he think of himself?
He just keeps blabbering.
Come.
Come on!
That's it. It's done.
Keep the stick down.
Come on now sit. And drive.
What is this happening?
What do you have to do? You
mind your business. Go!
The sword is hanging on our necks.
Stop worrying about the
small scars on it.
Leela, you don't know what
he did with my Sukhi?
Later! Later! Later!
When this junk starts moving then...
...the dead body will start
trembling and will fall off.
You sit inside. And
hold the dead body.
And see, if anyone asks then
say that he has not died.
He is just unconscious. We are
taking him to the doctor.
Stop giving me lectures. Drive
the car. Drive the car. - Yes.
Sit.
How will the car get driven?
I want to speak to you all.
Where are you all taking
Anthony-bhai and going?
To the hell. What do you
have to do, scoundrel?
Hey! Stop calling me scoundrel!
I am not your slave anymore.
By staying with you I have got
to know a lot of abuses.
Should I use them on you?
I won't respect your
age! Understood?
Hey! Why are you both fighting
in the middle of the road?
You go. Go!
- You explain him!
And where are you all taking
Anthony-bhai and going?
Nothing. He had become unconscious
after drinking.
That's why we are taking
him and going.
We are taking him to the doctor.
This happens everyday.
What is new in this?
Today it is a little too much.
He is fainting again and again.
That's why we are taking
him to the doctor.
To the doctor, is it?
What can a doctor do if you
take a dead body towards him?
Tell me!
Dead body. Of whom?
No. There is no one's dead body.
Look. Don't try to fool me.
I have heard everything.
I am going to report to the police.
Hey! Wait! Hey! Wait!
Leave my hand.
- At least listen to me.
I don't talk to killers
and murderers.
Who is a killer?
- Who is a killer? - You people!
We are not killers.
We haven't killed him.
He died by himself.
Means? - We will
explain you everything.
Come here. - Take him there.
Look at that. Look at it.
Just look at the happiness
on his face.
Does it look as if
we have killed him?
Have we strangled and
killed him? Look!
How much did you say that we
will get? - 1 crore. 1 crore.
But now we 3 will share
it between us.
Fine? You just accept it.
- No!
Wait! Wait!
- Why will he come in between?
There is no other option.
If he opens his mouth then
we will be in the prison.
There is no other option, Ballu.
Come here. - Yes. Tell me
what have you decided?
See. I neither want the money and
nor will I go to the police.
Then? - But... - Then what? - You
will have to agree to me. - What?
I will marry Sukhmani.
Hey scoundrel!
Since so many days you are having
these desires. Kill them.
As long as I am alive,
this won't happen.
Then I will marry Sukhmani
after he dies.
As it is the police won't spare
him until they hang him to death.
Listen! I might commit
one murder or 5.
I will be hanged once only. Then
I rather kill you and get hanged.
What are you all talking about?
Will you become a dacoit? - I will
not let this marriage happen!
Throw money on his face. And
the matter will be over.
If you want to throw 30 lakhs on...
...his face then give him
your daughter too.
Which guy who has 30 lakhs is
going to marry your daughter?
He just talks!
What are you thinking?
You are right.
Why didn't I think of this first?
He agreed! Your father-in-law
has agreed.
What are you talking? - Keep quiet!
I have already said it.
She is my daughter too.
Listen.
- Yes.
See now no one should look at the...
...dead body and we have to throw
it in the river. Understood?
Hold it carefully.
Or else you wont get married and
nor will we get rich! Sit.
Sit, Ballu. - Sit. - Catch it.
- Yes, I am holding it.
Wait! Stop!
It seems as if something is wrong.
It seems that it is Chinni, her
mother, her uncle the wood cutter.
But so late in the night, they...
I will see. Wait.
What happened?
- What happened?
Good that we found you both here.
We were going to your house.
- Why?
The village head has called for
a village meeting urgently.
He has sent a message to all
the village heads too.
We can't come now. We have to
go for an important work.
Why has he called for a village
meeting so late in the night?
What happened?
Her husband has given her
gold ring to that dancer.
And now we are asking it back then...
...she says that she has bought it.
And now we want the ring back...
...before her troupe starts
migrating to another place.
That's why we have called
for a village meeting.
And how will the village meeting...
...be held without you
two village heads.
Who is he? Anthony-bhai?
No. No.
There is nothing.
He was lying on the road after
drinking in an unconscious state.
So we were taking him to a doctor.
If we don't take him soon then
it will get really late.
Understood? Nothing else.
Fine. We all will come to
the doctor with you all.
Then we will go to the
village meeting.
See, that is not possible.
We will do something.
Ballu, come here!
His health is not fine.
He doesn't have a mother.
Move away! Let the air come in.
Move away!
Ballu, this will be horrid.
If they come along with us,
then we will be ruined!
So now what should we do?
There is only one option. Kanhaiya...
Go, Kanhaiya. Go to Leela.
Come here!
Ballu!
Tell him!
We will go with the villagers.
- Yes.
And you go and throw him in the
Manjira river. Understood?
And be careful that no
one should see you.
Understood? Do it tactfully.
And leave this vehicle at my house.
We will meet in the morning.
No. I can't do this
task all by myself.
Do something all by
yourself at least.
But... - He is a dead man.
He won't eat you away.
Listen to me!
- Take him to the doctor! Go!
Sir!
Father!
Sukhi! Sukhi!
Wait! It's me, Kanhaiya!
Wait! Stop!
What are you looking at?
How did you get father's vehicle?
It is a very long story.
Now we don't have to
elope from the house.
Father has accepted our marriage.
How is that?
Really? I can't believe it.
Then have a look at the dead body.
It is kept in the car.
Car? Where is the car?
The car is here.
Dead body? Where is the dead body?
The dead body is not here.
Where did the dead body go?
Tomorrow what will
I tell Leela uncle.
And your father will beat me up
and turn me into a dead body.
You wait here. I will go
down and have a look.
Kanhaiya, there is a jungle down
there. Don't go. Come back.
But I will have to
find the dead body.
Someone is coming here.
If that person sees both of us
together. Then there will be a chaos.
It makes no sense to find
dead body in the dark.
Let's take the vehicle and go.
Kanhaiya, come!
Hey Hariya! Did your cow give
birth to a calf or not?
Ballu! Ballu!
Kanhaiya.
- He is inside. - Then call him.
Brother!
He is there.
It seems that he eats,
sleeps, drinks...
...and does everything else
on an elephant only.
Tell me. Where did you
throw the dead body?
Dead body?
- Yes.
Where you had said. In the river.
And did you put the bottle
containing liquor in his pocket?
Yes. - In the pocket. - 
I put it in the pocket.
This scoundrel is lying.
Whenever he says a lie
he starts stammering.
I am saying the truth.
Then just prove it to us. Come on.
Show it us. - No, no. No.
I mean there is no point in that.
There was a lot of
force in the river.
Then in that the dead body must...
...have drifted to the
neighboring village.
Then it is fine. You are correct.
I have a few gunny bags.
Fill money in them and get them.
These are not vegetables that he...
...will fill them in gunny
bags and give them.
When the prize money is
more that 1 lakh rupees...
...then we have to inform
the lottery officer.
Then he will send his Inspector.
- Police Inspector?
No. Not the police.
An officer from the lottery
office will come.
He will inquire where was the
person living, what he used...
...to do, his parent's names,
ration card, etcetera.
And then we will get
the money. Only then.
Then what do we have to do?
We have to call up the
lottery office...
...and tell them that our ticket
has won the first prize.
Then come, we will go to
the 'Laxmi Dhan Bhandar'.
Come.
- Come.
I am giving the money
for the phone call.
Later we will add
it in the accounts.
Fine?
That is mine.
Take it, sister.
- Tell me the price. - 5 rupees.
Hello. Lottery office?
Hello, I am speaking
from Lahori village.
My ticket has won the first prize.
The number is 3...
What happened?
This ticket...
What happened? Why
are you perspiring?
Leela uncle, your face
has turned pale.
What happened? Say at least.
Not here. There is too much
crowd. Come, Ballu.
He is weird!
What has happened?
Wait! Stop! Stop!
Will you say something or not?
Or has a snake bitten you?
Now forget the money. Now
just save your life.
Why? What happened? Did you
tell the lottery guy or not?
He has said everything before
dying. - How? - What?
Anthony has said everything.
But Leela uncle, Anthony is dead.
He was not born dead.
Before dying he had said.
'Lottery office? Malamaal
Lottery Office? '
'I have a ticket. Bumper ticket.
Bumper prize. Of 1 crore.'
'Name? '
'Malamaal Lottery.'
'Oh! Anthony. Joseph
Anthony Fernandes.'
'Ticket number? One second.
PA1... Oh no! '
'PA13765.'
'House number 18.'
'Umaria village. No, no.
Lahori village.'
'Zilla is Umaria.'
'Ration card number?
I don't know, sir.'
'One minute. I will find.'
'I have jus drank till date.
Who has eaten? '
'Ration card, where are you?
Yes, I found it.'
'Write it, sir. Write it.
Write down. Write it.'
'225C687.'
'Yes! '
'Send the money right away.'
And not only this.
The lottery people had called
up again at Anthony's house.
For what?
- For checking. - What checking?
The lottery people know that the...
...prize money of the lottery
ticket is of Anthony.
What are you staring at?
Your marriage is now not happening.
- What?
You had discussed.
I had just discussed not promised.
Look, don't go back on your words.
- So?
Hey! Now be quiet!
Now how will we solve this
puzzle think of that.
What puzzle?
What we didn't have in our
fate how will we get that?
Fool! I am not talking
about the money.
Then what are you talking about.
That... lottery Inspector will come
here searching for Anthony.
And here Anthony's dead body will...
...be floating in the river
and will come up.
Now the police will think that
in the greed of 1 crore...
...someone has killed Anthony
and thrown him away.
And Devidas and Chunni
they will tell them.
That they had seen Anthony with us.
We were taking him to the doctor.
And the doctor will say
that no one came here.
Then the story shapes up that we...
...have killed Anthony and
thrown the dead body away.
If we had Anthony's dead body then...
How is that possible? That
has gone away in the river.
And the money also we won't get!
And we will go to jail.
Jail? I won't go to jail.
I will say that both of you
have killed him together.
Hey!
- Hey!
I didn't kill him.
When I reached Anthony-bhai's...
...house then I saw that there
was a knife in his hand.
And his veil was in
Anthony-bhai's neck.
I said... I said that I don't want
money. He said that 50 lakhs...
Greetings!
- Greetings!
Yesterday where had you
taken Anthony and gone?
I... I... I didn't. We
had gone with you.
He had taken him and gone alone.
Me? Me... I had taken him
to the doctor. - Then?
What then? He was unconscious.
He became conscious.
He started shouting that he
would not go to the doctor.
He jumped off a running
vehicle and he ran away.
Where did you see the dead body?
Which dead body?
Dead body?
He is not going to die so soon!
He is sitting on the banks
of Manjira river.
On the branch of the
tree. Go and see.
Scoundrel! You had thrown the
dead body in the river, right?
Then how did it go on the branch?
Did the river start flowing
from above the tree?
Or did it dry over night?
Don't fight like a mongoose
and a snake!
Now we have to see that whether
luck is on our side or not?
Come. Come.
Luck? Now who is this Luck?
Luck! He is the uncle of
my mother. Luck uncle.
Come sit.
Wait! Stop! Wait!
Where is it? - This is the place.
- Then show. - Come.
Come down.
Be careful.
Where did it go?
There is Anthony.
On the branch. Up there.
See, he is sitting on the
branch like a cheetah.
How did the dead body get up there?
Hey! Say the truth. What
did you do? - I will say.
I stepped out to pee.
Whenever you see he is peeing.
- No.
After that the car slipped down
and got stuck in the tree.
After that I tried to
find a lot but...
...I couldn't find the
dead body. - Yes.
The dead body must have flied
in the air like a ball...
...and gone and sat on
the branch of the tree.
You are right.
- I will slap you now.
And you will go and sit next to him.
Ballu, wait!
Go and get the rope. Why
are you looking at me?
Go and get the rope.
- Yes. I will get it.
If anyone sees him on the branch
then they will get us hanged.
Leela, come a little behind.
If the branch breaks then 100 kilos
of weight will fall on us.
See how he is smiling by
showing all his teeth.
He is smiling like Lord Krishna.
As if the damsels are in the water...
...and their blouses
are in his hands.
Now, let it be. Let me think.
Take this.
- Here it is.
Put it around my neck
and hang me too. Go!
Climb up.
Tie the rope around his waist.
You hold one end of the rope
and throw the other end down.
Go!
- Go!
Very good! Very good!
Is he a monkey or your son-in-law?
Stop selling milk
and start a circus.
Tie the rope over there.
Now throw the rope down.
Yes. Enough.
Now push him.
Kick him.
That's it. Make him sit.
It looks as if we are making a
scare crow sit in the field.
This is fine.
Come.
Put it down.
- Down!
It seems he must be drinking
with this hand only.
Sit on it.
Now we will sprinkle a little
alcohol on the dead body.
What is that for? - The spirit
won't let the dead body rot.
And...
And the drunken spirit of
Anthony will be at peace.
No, you fool!
Actually the smell of the
alcohol won't let the...
...lottery Inspector come
close to the dead body.
We will tell him that he has
passed away after drinking.
This means we have
to just lie partly.
He has passed away. This is true.
This opened. And he only gave
his lottery ticket to us.
Understood?
See this thing of his.
It must be the Inspector!
- So quick?
He came very soon.
- How can he come so soon?
Who is it?
Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother!
Who is she?
- She is calling out for a brother.
So she must be a sister.
She is not mine.
Is she yours?
- No, she is not mine.
He has a sister. But
she is not the one.
Who are you, sister?
You come into my house
and ask me who I am?
I don't know why have you come...
...and started buttering
up my brother.
Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother!
After so many years I
am seeing you happy.
Jesus! You drink too much!
Now at least let go of it. Now
we have become millionaires.
Brother! My dear brother!
What happened?
Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother!
You fools! What happened
to my brother?
He died.
- Who killed him? Who killed him!
No one has killed him.
He died on his own.
He passed away naturally.
Oh God!
Let it be. Where is the
ticket of the lottery?
It is with him. Give it.
What should I give? Should I
give away the entire thing?
We have a business of selling
lottery tickets.
Not a ticket! I have an
entire shop of that.
If you want to buy a ticket then
I will get my entire shop.
Don't try to act!
Where is the ticket of 1 crore
prize money of my brother?
We don't know.
- Don't you know? - We don't know.
You don't know, is it?
Actually the thing is
that along with...
...Anthony his ticket must
have also passed away.
Shut up!
Anthony's dead body is here.
And there is no one in the house
besides you three people.
And there is no clue about
the lottery ticket.
We don't understand all this.
We are not that dumb!
Tell me one thing. Who told you
about this lottery ticket?
Brother himself.
He said.
'Sister! '
'I have been lucky.'
'Jesus has given so much.'
'No! It's not alcohol.'
'Not alcohol. Money! '
'I have become rich.'
'Lottery! '
'I have got Bumper prize...
of 1 crore.'
'You come, I have spent your share...
...of the house and field's
on alcohol, right? '
'Before I die, you take
50 lakh rupees.'
That's why we have come here.
Come on. Give me the lottery ticket.
Give it to them.
Give it to the ticket.
And let's go back empty handed.
No! What will happen of my marriage?
Your marriage, I am not
concerned about it!
Ballu! Ballu! Wait! I will
make them understand!
Go.
- Listen, sister!
If we have a big heart and
give you the ticket. - Yes.
Then what will you do?
You can't do anything with it.
- What do you mean?
I mean to say that your
brother had called...
...up the lottery office
and told them his name...
...address, the ticket number
and everything else.
Now the Inspector will come
from the lottery office.
And he will come here
for the enquiry.
Oh God!
And he will see that a dead
body is sitting on the chair.
And you are standing with
the ticket in your hand.
He will take you to
the jail directly.
You will become an orphan.
Your parents will go to jail.
You mean to say that
the money has gone?
The money has not gone.
And will not go too.
If we use our mind then it
won't go. - You come here.
Move behind!
See, stop talking small things.
Go for the big thing. Go!
See.
We have to show in front of the...
...lottery Inspector
that he has not died.
Yes!
- He is alive.
How?
Come with me. Come. Come.
Lift him up and keep
him on the chair.
Ballu, go! - Come, Kanhaiya!
Get the chair straight.
Lift him.
Hold him from there.
- He is too fat!
He is fat!
Just see that he doesn't get hurt.
If the blood comes out then
it would be a problem.
That's it. Fine.
Keep it here.
Tell me, do you agree or not?
Now don't look here and there.
If you agree then say a yes or a no.
Or else 3 of us are there. - But
we don't have any other option.
Fine, they have agreed.
- But listen!
This money will be distributed
equally amongst us three.
Not you three. We four!
Yes! You will have one share.
He will have one. He and
one share of mine. Four!
What are you talking?
If it is 4 then how much will
come in each one's share?
Now each one would get
around 20 to 25 lakhs.
It is a very huge amount, dear.
- Fine then. Come on.
What is fine?
This means that my
marriage is fixed.
Yes, you can give birth
to a son too. Shut up!
First the death procession
will commence...
...then the marriage procession
will commence. Come on!
