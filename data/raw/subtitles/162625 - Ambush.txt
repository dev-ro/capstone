Our division crossed the frontier
and pushed the Russians eastward -
but our company was held back
on the Finnish side for half a week -
though others fought
in the wilds of Viena.
Many of my men had also
taken part in the Winter War -
so they knew what awaited them.
Another legacy of the Winter War -
was that we knew
how to live the soldier's life.
This included not being afraid until
there was something to be afraid of.
Jump, Tauno!
-Go ahead, jump.
Jump, Tauno!
It's not all that high.
-Come on.
Tauno, Don't do it.
You'll drown.
Come on down, Pa.
There's nothing to it.
How're you at swimming?
I'm no Weissmuller.
We'll toss you down from here.
Goddamn it, no, boys.
-You bet.
That's the system!
Oh, hell...
Somebody go help him.
-Lend a hand, boys.
Let's get a few more in the photo.
You too, Tauno, come on.
The order to report to my unit
came to my home.
I left Helsinki before midsummer.
Kaarina saw me to the station.
She didn't know
where she was being ordered.
War was in the air.
I had written
many letters to Kaarina -
but I had received no reply and I
didn't know if they had reached her.
Missing your fiancée, Lieutenant?
What do you expect, Corporal?
We're taking a picture, sir.
Close it up, boys.
That's right.
Here we go.
Orders from unit command.
Acknowledged.
So we're to proceed eastward.
We departed Lieksa
in the afternoon -
and crossed the border
early that evening.
We were preceded by
the 10th lnfantry Regiment.
There were no objectors
among us at the border.
The men felt that it was time
to take back with interest -
what the Russians had plundered
from us in the Winter War.
We officers were read
Mannerheim's order of the day.
The commander-in-chief said:
"We know what
Stalin's promises are worth. "
"We are strong enough
to uphold our liberty" -
"and defend our brothers
in Eastern Karelia. "
"We shall not sheathe our swords
until law and order prevail. "
"We need not accept
as charity that land" -
"which by blood bond
belongs to us. "
We're too late to join in.
The enemy's withdrawn.
I have this feeling Eero's nearby.
I have to ask if he's here.
But we can't leave the gear.
-You go on ahead.
Mist hangs o'er the shining shore...
Excuse me...
Has a Lieutenant Eero Perkola
been brought here?
Quit yammering.
I can't even hear my own voice.
Second Light lnfantry.
He's my fiancé.
We don't have time
for names here.
That's enough of that whining!
Hell, even more of them.
Haven't you seen the dead before?
Winter before last I stacked
frozen corpses at Kollaanjoki.
What is it?
Almost everything's been burned.
I guess our village
looks like this, too.
They said our own men burned it,
withdrawing in the Winter War.
Our house too. Ma still grieves,
remembering the apple trees.
When they blossomed, folks said
the garden was as white as rapids.
You'll plant new trees
when the war is over.
If they don't order us elsewhere,
let's set up the canteen together.
Lieutenant...
Where do we bivouac, sir?
Continue on with the platoon.
You'll be shown there
where we'll spend the night.
Hannikainen's detachment has
gained Pohjoisranta. -Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Perkola reporting.
I'll be damned.
I've been expecting you.
Welcome aboard.
The division's attacking
toward Rukajärvi.
All we know is that the enemy has
fallen back beyond Lieksajärvi.
Light lnfantry will
take point position.
Paasivirta, your company
has the honor of leading off.
How far do we go?
Belomorsk, the Murmansk line,
the shores of the White Sea -
even the Urals if they let us.
It's planned that far, is it?
What is it?
I keep having the same dream.
I was sure you'd be
among the wounded or dead.
I've often dreamed you were dead.
I was sure I'd never see you again.
It's no good talking like that.
We've got to get you back
across the Finnish border.
Let's go away together.
We will. Just as soon
as all this is over.
Do what you did before.
May I speak with you, Major?
Regarding what?
The women's auxiliaries here.
They should be sent back.
There are auxiliaries at the front?
They were ordered to Kolvasjärvi -
but they were brought
all the way to Repola.
What has that to do with you?
One of them is my fiancée.
What is your name?
-Lieutenant Perkola, sir.
I understand.
I'll see to it.
I'm much obliged, sir.
Perkola, I need a group of
volunteers for a special mission.
My platoon will go if requested.
You will advance from Repola
to Porajärvi and this creek.
Dig in there
and await further orders.
I'm going to say this to you alone
and it mustn't go any further:
We have no information on the
flanks of the enemy division.
We cannot advance until we know
how many of them the woods hold.
There's a hundred-kilometer
breach in the front.
They could put a hundred
thousand men through it.
That's a mere Russian per meter.
They won't bring up that many.
You just hold along that creek.
If the Russians attack,
hold them there and inform me.
Otherwise, await further orders.
-Understood.
Any questions?
-No, sir.
A convoy's leaving soon for Lieksa.
It'll take you away from here.
Promise me one thing...
No, forget it.
Keep this with you.
Order of march:
second squad starts at point.
Then first and third.
I'm on point with first squad.
What's our mission, Lieutenant?
We advance toward Porajärvi
and establish defenses there.
That's all I'm at liberty to say.
You two take point first,
and keep your distance.
Lieutenant, they're sending us off
alone into the jaws of death?
I wouldn't call it that.
Let's hump it, Karppinen.
We're the jaws of death here.
It's time we wolfed some Russians.
I'm supposed
to escort that maniac..?
My darling,
I will wait for you.
It has long been clear to me
that our future together -
does not depend
on the final outcome of this war -
on whoever wins or loses.
Our future together
depends only on the two of us -
on our hopeful wishes.
When we parted,
I tried to say -
that whatever happens to you
in this war, I will wait for you.
I will wait for our life together:
A life we will
not share with anyone.
Not even the fatherland.
"You have not crushed our resolve
nor our will to victory."
"Throw down your weapons
and return home to your families."
Not a hair turns here
without the Lord knowing.
Hopefully not.
Your squad can take point now.
Tell the men to fix their gear
to the bicycles properly -
so as not to make that
infernal racket. -I'll see to it.
Ville and Lukkari out front.
-Get a move on.
There was no need to put
your son on point first.
There are no sons here,
only Finnish soldiers.
If you say so.
Lieutenant Paasivirta.
Orders from the chief of staff.
We're to leave at once.
This very minute?
We can't just go.
We have fifteen thousand men
attacking Russia.
I'm not going
to quibble about this.
Louhela, take the girls
with the wounded to Lieksa.
You're to be gone by afternoon.
Is that clear? -Quite clear.
May I leave this letter with you?
-Better send it from Lieksa.
It's for my fiancée. Lieutenant
Perkola, Second Light lnfantry.
Make it quick,
the convoy's just leaving.
Remember that you represent
a grand patriotic organization.
Avoid doing anything that...
There's Russkies.
-They're evacuees.
Like hell they're refugees.
They've all got to be searched.
Let's take a look first.
Let's just take it real easy now.
Do you speak Finnish?
-No understand...
We're Karelian folks, all of us.
We don't mean nobody any harm.
You seen any Russians?
Far off gone to White Sea.
Search the men's belongings.
What you got there, old man?
What would he have,
an old geezer like that?
We search everyone.
No exceptions.
Hold your fire!
Goddamn it, hold your fire!
Just look what he was hiding.
Come here, Karppinen.
Come here.
Look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye, soldier!
This won't happen again?
No, it won't, Lieutenant.
Dismissed.
He got a pretty bad case of
shell shock during the Winter War.
He's had time to recover.
Snicker's lot's covering the creek
and mine are backing up, as ordered.
Good. Rotate the men
so they all get some rest.
Any word from supply on rations?
The men had nothing
but dry bread on the way here.
They said provisions would follow.
They won't let us starve here.
Care for some, Lieutenant?
-What it is?
Me and the boys
boiled some water.
You boys make strong soup.
Orders from division headquarters.
Acknowledged.
-They include this map.
I have another message for you.
A report to Repola said -
that partisans attacked
the convoy on its way to Lieksa.
And the auxiliaries?
Was there anything about them?
They were all killed.
All of them?
So I was told.
What was that all about?
What do you want, Corporal?
I though I'd come for a chat.
About what?
Sir, if you want to talk,
I'm here to listen.
I'm no stranger to sorrow.
I'm reminded of words of solace
from the gospel of Matthew.
No words are needed here.
Assemble the men for a briefing.
The hamlets run around the lake.
First Tusenya, then Tscholky.
That's Koroly, where we're headed.
From there we send information to HQ.
-What information would that be?
Whether there are
Russians beyond the lake.
The division will attack toward
Rukajärvi from the north.
That's Virta, where our boys
should be let through to attack.
We hold at Koroly
and await orders.
The Russians are already
a long way off by now.
If the village is empty,
signal us and we'll follow.
Have you got that?
-Yes, sir.
What's up?
ls there somebody in there?
Tell the men to prepare
to enter the village.
Goddamn it.
Let's go.
There's Russians there all right.
We'll wait a while.
There's no food around.
Someone's just been here.
The ashes are still warm.
What's with Ville?
There's a bride made ready there,
but she won't do for him.
There's a dead woman in there.
Why blubber over one carcass?
You'll see a deal worse in war.
Get up from there.
There you have our Russkie.
So it's a foal stoking the stove.
Eero..?
Don't you get it? I'll cook
the meat. It'll feed all of us.
You won't shoot a horse's child!
-Calm down.
So shoot both of us, damn it.
-Just back off, Jussi.
Step back!
-You are not shooting this foal!
I'll shoot both of you!
-Go ahead!
You're not shooting anyone!
-Help us out, sir!
Lukkari.
That'll do.
So, you can shoot
all the people you want to.
You're ordered to.
Then you cry over a single foal.
-Someone ought to clobber you.
Right, strict order on duty,
otherwise it's orgies.
Damn it, now he stumbled.
Watch where you stick your feet.
I've got other things to do besides
looking after you. -Let the kid be.
Don't you tell me how to raise
my son, you Red Guard whelp.
I beg your pardon.
My father raised me differently,
before your kind executed him.
So this is where you mean
to draw the border?
Where the hell
are these pyromaniacs?
Waiting on the other bank,
I reckon.
One guess what this means, gents.
I figure this is as far as we go.
We can't cross that, can we?
If this is as far as we go,
let's all set up house here.
We have to get across.
I need two volunteers.
Count me in.
Me, too.
-Let's get going.
Who's burning these bridges?
Whoever gets there first.
I thought that was obvious.
I guess they know
who they're up against.
What's it look like?
They're building a plank bridge.
It's like the woods over there
are crawling with Russians.
Death lies in ambush there.
-Just keep moving forward.
For Christ's sake,
don't stop here!
What's holding things up?
-It's that goddamn Karppinen.
My bike fell in the water, sir.
Goddamn it!
-Move it!
It just slipped out of my hands.
I didn't mean to...
Return to Repola on foot.
By myself? -Let Moilanen
and Leinonen accompany him.
We can't spare an escort
for chickenshit like him.
You'll have to walk back.
And while you're at it, think about
what really happened to the bike.
I could run along behind.
I could run along behind.
I doubt there's anyone there.
Raassina, go with Lukkari.
With that communist you'll
wind up in Red Square. -Get going.
You stay here and cover us.
If I decide I'm going in, I go in.
-No, you won't!
You can damn well be sure...
I'll shoot you!
You're not going in!
We wait for the others!
What the hell..?
What's the problem?
-Nothing, except that.
It's booby-trapped.
How? Martti, how's it armed?
They've mined it.
I don't see any wires
running from it.
The whole verandah
could be mined.
A line runs to the trigger
from a hole under the rifle butt.
Don't touch it.
Fetch some poles, boys.
We don't need any poles.
Jesus, Heikkinen!
The lock's even rusted solid.
So much for your booby-trap.
I consider this evidence of the
warped Russian sense of humor.
Goddamn lunatic...
Lay off it.
That's enough.
Go ahead and laugh.
Heikkinen!
Heikkinen!
Blessed are they
who dwell with you -
for they are forever grateful.
When they pass through
the Vale of Tears -
they change its springs to earth -
which the autumn rains
cover with blessings. Amen.
Seeing as you're
a singer, Knihti -
maybe you could sing something
in Heikkinen's memory.
If they have ears at all,
they heard the house blow up.
They're out there somewhere,
but they won't surprise us.
I'll make sure of that.
I'll make sure none of
the men sleep on watch.
And if they come -
they'll be up against more
than auxiliaries and the wounded.
I won't be sleeping.
Heikkinen's corpse has to be
transported before winter.
I drew a map which
shows the way to his grave.
But where is Kaarina's grave?
It's unlikely anybody's around.
I thought there was someone here.
Not all that long ago.
The food's just been put out.
We'll keep going.
And rest in Koroly.
What's bugging him?
Everyone's starting to see things.
The Finns are in the village.
Let's go!
What's going on?
The enemy's in the village.
What about me, Liosa?
-I'm sorry...
The Russians may be on the island,
so circle around it.
I can't spare the map,
so stick to the compass heading.
In Repola give
division command this message:
We encountered no Russians.
-Who to?
Just take it to HQ.
They'll know who.
Tell them its from Koroly.
Return here immediately.
I've requested them
to give you a boatload of bread.
If we're not here on your return,
follow the road to Virta.
What do we do with the bread?
Bring it here, of course.
But if you're not here anymore?
In that case,
the two of you eat it.
The whole boatload?
-Come on, let's go.
Wait. Take this along,
it's got an address.
I'm sending your mother a letter.
There's greetings from you too,
saying you've been doing just fine.
What barbarians' lair is this?
It could be a grade school
or secondary school.
No, I'd say a grade school,
judging by the smell.
You've a keen nose, Corporal.
For all I care,
it could be a university.
Corporal Ervert Rönkkö
heads University of Koroly
Make sure we're all
in the frame with the writing.
This isn't going to work.
-It's as easy as firing a rifle.
Is the range right?
Range? What range?
-Don't touch that.
Let's just take the photo.
A good-looking woman.
I doubt she knows
what you're up to here.
My son.
We christened him Gennady.
I know exactly how you feel.
My wife, Sonya.
Did I ask you a question?
Don't you look at me like that.
It's a big country, Russia.
As far as we've come, it's
still a good way to the Urals.
There's cigarette ashes here.
Out!
What the hell are you doing?
Target practice.
You should try it now and then.
Just leave him be.
Our neighbor doesn't show
much concern for their own.
Maybe he was left for dead.
You go right ahead.
You're doing goddamn fine.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of you.
We won't leave anyone here.
You want to carry him
to the hospital?
Carry him over by the fire anyway.
What's that?
-Artillery fire.
You figure it's ours? -Depends
on which you consider yours.
The boys made it through
with the message.
The division's attacking.
We head back
in the morning.
Are we continuing on from here?
Haven't we completed our mission?
We're not going
to set up house here.
But weren't we supposed to await
further orders here in Koroly?
That's no concern of yours.
What do we do with the prisoner?
That's not your concern either.
We must be merciful to others.
If we intend to continue,
we have to get rid of the Russian.
It wasn't necessary to kill him.
We're all God's children.
Even these poor wretches.
Saarinen, take point.
-Alone?
That should do it
on the final stretch.
Hit the deck!
-Shoot like hell!
Where's it coming from?
-The opposite bank!
Raise your fire!
Stay down!
Goddamn it, no.
Where the hell is it coming from?
-Aim this way, goddamn it!
Don't get up!
Hold your fire!
Rönkkö...
Two men down to get Saarinen.
How far do we go?
-Far enough to find him.
Kukkonen and Raassina, come along.
Let's try and make it to the bridge.
Goddamn it!
There's no way to get there!
We couldn't get to him!
-Retreat!
They have a message from Repola.
Orders from division headquarters.
Haven't we gone far enough?
Why go anywhere from here?
We're instructed to join the
division's offensive at Virta.
We attack the enemy rear
first thing in the morning.
That's the situation.
Any questions?
No. Couldn't be clearer.
What about the bread, sir?
Yes, what do we do with the bread?
Jesus...
-It's Saarinen!
We did go look for you.
You two see that Saarinen
gets to Repola safely.
Can't I continue on with you?
Just try to get him
tended to quickly.
Lieutenant...
You know what I saw?
Angels.
I was in heaven.
We attack the enemy's rear -
and push through
to our own lines.
There's a river
which we'll have to cross.
We're pounding
the hell out of them.
So that's where we're headed.
-Are you afraid?
Yes, Lieutenant, I am.
Are you others afraid?
No way.
You watch yourself in there.
Stick close to me, stay calm
and put your helmet on.
Don't stop until Virta.
Take some men
and cover the left flank!
Tauno, take the right!
I'll go for the center!
Ville!
Ville! Goddamn it!
Hands up!
Ville, take cover!
This way, fast!
Ville, over here!
I killed a man!
-Get across, move it!
You too.
Give me that.
Hold your fire!
Don't fire into the water.
They're on our side!
Father!
-Ville...
Who are you?
-The Perkola unit.
You had a close call there.
We had no idea that
some of our own were coming.
They're taking me with the convoy
tomorrow to the military hospital.
If there was some...
I hope there's no hard feelings.
Between us.
You have a cigarette?
No.
I could've smoked one,
now that there's time.
This was returned.
Unable to deliver.
I'm sorry.
It has long been clear to me -
that our future together
does not depend -
on the final outcome of this war,
on whoever wins or loses it.
Our future together depends
only on the two of us -
on our hopeful wishes.
Whatever happens to you in
this war, I will wait for you.
I will wait for
our life together -
a life we will not have
to share with anyone.
How long will the night
between us continue?
A week?
A month?
A year?
I am already living in tomorrow -
of which I dream of
while writing this letter to you.
I wait for you there.
