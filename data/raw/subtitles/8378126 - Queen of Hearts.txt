- Hi, Mom.
- Why haven't you left yet?
- We don't know.
- Where's Dad?
He is inside.
Why haven't you left?
They called from
Stockholm, the police.
They want me to come up.
Why?
I don't know.
- I'll go with you.
- No. Stay with the girls.
- They can sleep over at...
- There's no need.
I think it's better if I go alone.
Rebecca will be there, too.
- Shall I drive you to the airport?
- I've called a taxi.
- Will you call me when you get there?
- Yes.
- Mom?
- Put your clothes on.
- There's someone in the bathroom.
- It's just someone from work.
- Did you find your shoes?
- No.
Find another pair, then.
I thought we had an agreement.
No, we had a discussion,
where we couldn't agree.
I don't bring my patients home.
Because they suffer
from all sorts of infectious diseases.
This is our home
and we can't have all sorts
of people roaming around here.
It's not 'all sorts of people'.
It's people that need help.
We're not discussing
if they need help or not -
- but if they should be here,
in our home.
- I don't want to do this.
- It won't work when Gustav moves in.
No.
Can't we have just one place where
the girls can be free of your work?
One single place where the girls
get to have their mom to themselves?
Letting real life into our home
won't harm them.
Why can't you ever say:
"Yes, Peter, I understand, Peter."?
Why does everything have to become
an endless discussion?
- Come on, honey...
- No. I can say what I feel and think.
Okay, Peter.
I understand, Peter.
- No, no, no...
- Yes, you're right, Peter.
I'm so lucky.
You know that, right?
Yes, I know.
Did you drink any alcohol that night?
- Yes.
- How much did you have?
Two or three drinks.
- Two or three?
- Three.
How many men have you been
dating in the past year?
- Less than 10? More than 10?
- Less than 10.
And how many of them
did you have intercourse with?
Listen, you should be prepared for
the defense coming down hard on you.
They want to create an image
of a woman who asked for it.
So, how many?
- Seven, I think.
- You think?
No, I...
Seven.
Good.
You're going to do fine in court.
Do you think it's a lot?
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Not at all.
The rabbit hole went straight on
like a tunnel for some way -
- and then it turned so suddenly,
that Alice did not have a moment -
- to think about stopping,
and she fell and fell down a well.
Either the well was very deep,
or Alice fell very slowly -
- for she had plenty of time
as she went down to look around -
- and to wonder
what was going to happen next.
Mom?
Why can't I stay up
until Gustav arrives?
They'll be here very late.
I promise I won't tell Frida.
- He'll be here when you wake up.
- So are we his family now?
We always have been.
Then why hasn't
he been living with us?
He's been staying with Rebecca,
you know that.
- Why?
- Because she's his mom.
And he couldn't live
in two countries at once.
So Dad preferred to be with us?
It's not that simple, pumpkin.
- No more thinking. Time to sleep.
- Okay.
- Night-night.
- Night.
Hello.
Hi!
That was early.
- Welcome, Gustav.
- Thanks.
It's good to see you.
- Did you have a nice trip?
- Sure.
I made the key chain
for your new key.
I made the drawings.
You like them?
- Thank you.
- I made the wooden heart out of wood.
We have this workshop at school
with a machine to cut...
Go sit down, you two.
Dad, can you pick us up today?
No, Mom will pick you up.
I have stuff to do with Gustav.
- Can I come?
- No, it's just him and me.
That's not fair.
I know. The world isn't fair.
Frida, go sit on your chair.
- I wanna sit with Daddy.
- Come on, you're a big girl.
I thought we could buy some things
for your room today.
Sure. If you want to.
I thought maybe you'd like
to make it more your own.
Sure.
- Will you take this?
- Yes.
- I didn't think he wanted to see you.
- Nah...
He's been kicked out of school again.
Rebecca wanted him
off to boarding school.
We talked her into letting him -
- finish school down here instead.
He's starting after the summer break.
- Does he even understand Danish?
- It's almost the same as Swedish.
Either way he's
against the very idea.
You can't
blame him for that.
- He left all his friends and stuff.
- But it's not going to be forever.
I hope he'll move out again
at some point.
But still.
- How does Peter feel about it?
- He's looking forward to it.
But of course he's
a little anxious too.
I think it'll be
good for both of them.
Sure.
How's Mom doing these days?
She's been in the hospital again,
something with her lungs.
I'm sure a visit from you
would cheer her up.
Yeah...
It's completely unacceptable
that you drag out the case like this.
Yes, and I think you'll
agree that it's ridiculous,
if you give it a thought.
Sure.
Good.
You just call me anytime.
Thanks a lot. Bye.
Hey.
Sorry. I didn't know you were home.
I was just bringing some of your stuff
down and...
Thank you.
Is it any good?
What's it about?
- A man.
- Okay.
- Just a man?
- Yes.
Alrighty then.
- Sorry. I know it's really late.
- Did something happen?
I don't think it'll work out.
I know it's tough. But I will be
right beside you the whole time.
I can't do it.
I just can't.
I don't blame you for
just wanting to let it all go.
But you're not just doing it for you.
You're also doing it for
all the other girls out there.
I just wish I hadn't started all this.
- What are you afraid of?
- That they won't believe me.
I completely understand your concern.
And maybe he won't be convicted.
But if you don't testify,
you're the one that lets him off.
And I think you'll regret that.
Let me take that for you.
- Who showers first?
- Well, you went first last time.
Yeah, because the horse threw me off.
- Come on, your helmet, please.
- But that's not a good reason.
- I was really filthy.
- Yeah, well, today I smell the most.
Easy now, you both smell a lot.
We'll have to flip a coin, then.
I can't live in Sweden,
and I can't live here.
You're not old enough.
When you are, you can do as you like.
- That's a bad excuse.
- You're still a minor.
And until you're old enough,
Mom and I decide what's best for you.
- "Mom and you"?!
- Listen to me!
We don't think you're mature enough
to move out on your own.
- Because you and Mom are talking now?
- I won't debate this any longer.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out!
Damn it!
It's like we don't
even know each other.
It's the first time you live together.
It takes time to find each other.
- I have no clue who he is.
- It'll come.
I don't know. Maybe it was
wrong of us to bring him here.
Maybe a boarding school would've been
better for him.
- You know that's not right for him.
- But he doesn't want to be here!
- I can feel it. He hates me.
- Of course he does, you're his dad.
You'll just have to endure it.
You're the adult.
Rebecca has been giving
him a free pass for far too long.
Because she's so self-absorbed
and then she gives up.
And then he spins out of control,
and I'm left alone with all the mess.
That's not fair. Who was left
with the mess when you just took off?
When did you become Rebecca's ally?
I'm just saying she's been
handling him all on her own.
- But I wasn't allowed to help...
- Well, now you are.
It might be too late.
Maybe we should start demanding
something of him.
Right now, this place
is like a hotel to him.
I don't think that's very healthy.
We should involve him more.
Hello?
Yes.
No, no. I'll come in.
Absolutely. Bye.
- Have a good night.
- Good night.
Wait...
Just wait a second.
You did really well.
- I feel so stupid.
- Yes, but it's not your fault.
They didn't believe me.
And I told you that would be the case.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Are you having fun?
I'll call you right back.
Okay. Bye.
Does it feel real good?
An iPad, my bag,
your collection of watches, jewelry...
I'm not sure what more
is missing exactly.
Yes, I've called the police.
They're on their way.
Hang on.
Gustav, check your room.
We've had a break-in.
Okay.
Yeah...
No, luckily they're at riding class.
Good. Yeah, see you later.
Bye.
I didn't accuse exactly, I insinuated.
You approached a defendant
in a parking lot.
My client was being bullied in court,
and the defendant was having a ball.
If the Bar Association
believes him,
it's not over with
just paying the fine.
- They may require it publicized.
- I'll pay.
It's not about the money!
It's unprofessional. Don't you see?
- Why do you care what people think?
- Well, this is sort of my company, too.
Yes, but when we became partners,
you knew what you were in for.
You know me! You know what I'm like!
When did you become such a chicken?
Can't you just for once
admit you made a mistake?
- Come on...
- You must learn to control yourself.
- Yes.
- Yes.
I found this.
- I believe it's yours?
- Yes, thanks.
It's just that I found it
out in the driveway a while back.
And then I put it in my bag,
but I forgot to give it to you -
- and then my bag was stolen
in the break-in.
And then today I found it in your
pants when I was doing laundry.
You go through my stuff?
It's pretty advanced to break into
your own home, Gustav.
- What are you talking about now?
- Where's all the stuff you've stolen?
Are you kidding?
You'll have to tell Peter.
And then we can go
to the police later and explain.
Or I can tell him, if you prefer.
- Do what the hell you want.
- I doubt you mean that.
- You don't know me!
- No. But I know the system.
And I know it's tough to get out
once you get in.
Especially for
someone like you who
already has experience with the police.
But there is also another option.
And that is not telling anyone.
But that requires that you
lean into the family and step up.
I don't know
if you're capable of doing that?
So you have a decision to make.
What is your favourite dish?
- I only get to choose one thing?
- Of course.
Okay, chicken curry.
What is your favourite animal?
I've got rabbit, dog and horse,
but I can only choose one thing.
- So I choose dog.
- Nice.
- What's up with the tape recorder?
- It's my old one.
He found it in the basement.
I don't know what he's up to.
- Lucas now wants a brother, too.
- Go on then and have more kids, Lina.
Go on then and hook me up with a hot
young doctor from the hospital, Peter.
They're all sold out at the moment,
but I can get you an old doctor.
You know, a guy with lots of ear hair.
What would you bring?
Okay, my blanket.
Hi!
Hey. Sorry, we...
- This is Amanda.
- Hi.
This is my stepmom.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Amanda. Hi.
- Anne. Hi.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Have you been out?
- I guess you could say that.
We've just been hanging out
a little, you know...
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that you were up and...
No, no, I was just working.
Okay, then. Hello and goodbye.
We don't want to disturb you, so...
- And then what do you do?
- I throw the chair at the window.
- Why?
- I want to get out of there.
So why don't you
just open the window?
It's bolted.
- Why not use the door then?
- It's locked.
So, your foster parents
have bolted the window
and locked the door, correct?
Yes.
What do you do then, when your foster
father eventually opens the door?
I accidentally push him.
Why do you do that?
I just want to get away from there.
Thank you.
- That was late.
- I had to prepare stuff for tomorrow.
- I'm not quite finished here.
- Are you sure?
I just had a breakthrough on the
article I have promised to write.
You can finish it
during the weekend.
I can't, I'm going
on a conference.
- You are?
- It's in the calendar.
Oh, I didn't notice.
Look at this.
Let me just rinse it.
I found something!
A shell!
- No, it was just a twig.
- There!
- There, there, there!
- What did you find?
- Aren't you going to swim?
- No, I have stuff to do.
Boring.
Let's see what we can find.
- Look for the white shells.
- And clams!
- Are you going for a swim?
- Yes, I thought I would.
You never go swimming.
Is she completely out?
Do you miss Stockholm?
Yes... and no.
Feel free to invite people
to come and visit, if you like.
I don't have that many friends.
Right.
Me neither.
Where do you get those done?
- These?
- Yes.
Here and there.
I know someone who knows someone...
- I did these myself.
- I didn't know people still do that.
Sure.
It's easy.
- I can make one on you.
- No. I'm not having any.
- Why not?
- I'm just not.
It's just skin.
If I wanted a tattoo,
I could've gotten one a long time ago.
No.
Can I take a look at your arm?
Can I see your arm?
Yes, perfect. Right here.
A tiny one.
No. Not there.
- Okay. Where then?
- Nowhere!
A bit higher up. Hang on.
Right there.
The world's smallest tattoo.
Forget it.
Where, did you say?
- Do you like it?
- Mm.
Thanks.
- That was that.
- That was that.
I'll just take this out.
Argh, damn it...
Anyway, we're talking
thousands of dead toads by this lake.
And they've all exploded.
Caused by an
explosion down the lake?
- No.
- No. Listen instead.
- I am!
- First, they suspected a virus.
Coming from some South American
horses at the nearby riding school.
But then a biologist took a look
into it and discovered -
- that on the back of each toad
there was a tiny, tiny hole -
- and that all the toads
were missing their liver.
- So it was simply a toad massacre?
- The liver was ejected from the body?
No, it wasn't ejected.
It was taken out.
- By whom?
- Is it a delicacy?
- Who'd want to eat that?
- Birds, maybe?
Exactly. A bird.
- Am I right?
- But which bird?
- It's not just any bird...
- It must be a very...
Alright!
A crow!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Are you okay?
Sure.
- Want to come up and say hi?
- I'd rather not, if that's okay.
Sure, I don't blame you.
Where are you off to?
If you don't mind me asking.
I'm going out for cigarettes.
Would you like to come?
If you don't mind me asking.
It's going to be a lot of fun.
Yes.
Are you kidding?
You have people over!
Yeah.
How are things with Amanda?
What? Isn't that her name?
Anita? Amalie?
- Anna? Anthony?
- No.
Her name is Amanda.
It was just... the way you said it.
Is she nice?
Yes, she's nice.
She's very nice.
So, is she your girlfriend or what?
What does 'or what' mean?
Or maybe she's
not girlfriend material?
What kind of girl
isn't girlfriend material?
- I think you know.
- You think?
- How about you?
- Me and Peter?
We're fine.
- Yeah?
- I doubt you want to hear about that.
I for sure didn't want to hear about
my Mom and her...
- Did she have many men?
- Yep.
- And you?
- Me?
That's hard to say.
I probably wasn't
quite as active as you.
I've gotta go.
Amanda.
Anthony.
Well, thanks for the drink
and everything.
See you at home.
Where were you?
Did they leave already?
I tried to get hold of you, but your
phone was here. Where were you?
- I just went for a walk.
- A walk?
We had guests here!
Do you know how disrespectful that is?
Not just towards me, but to them!
Well?
And I was worried sick! At least take
your phone with you next time -
- so I can reach you.
Get a grip, please.
Here.
You can clean up the rest of it.
...5, 6, 7, 8 -
- 9, 10, 11, 12 -
- 13, 14...
Run!
Frida in the can!
Run! Gustav, hurry!
Okay. 1, 2, 3 -
- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
Hi.
- Do you need any help?
- Yes, I'm looking for a computer.
- Any particular computer?
- No, as long as it's all-around...
For heavy work or...
No, it just has
to be... really good.
Good. Yes.
It's for school
assignments and such.
How much is this one?
I bought Gustav a new computer.
- Why?
- He needed some proper equipment.
Is that a problem?
No.
Now he doesn't have any excuse
for not doing his homework.
Once he starts school.
But maybe we could've discussed it.
How can it be a problem
that I buy your son a new computer?
That's my point. He's my son.
Maybe I wanted to be a part of it.
Should I also ask your permission
to cook for him and do his laundry -
- or is it just when it comes
to the fun stuff?
No, no...
Right...
It was very kind of you.
I mean that. It was...
It was nice of you.
Forgive me.
Can I try?
Come here.
No, no, no...
- Not here.
- Why not?
- We'll wake them up.
- And so what?
I said, not here.
We'll wake up the kids.
Let's go upstairs. Let's go to bed.
Go, go, go.
Come on.
What the hell?!
He said I had ratted him out
to the social services.
Otherwise they wouldn't have begun
monitoring us again.
I told him I hadn't said anything,
but he didn't believe me.
Then he grabbed me
and then I just ran.
Does he do this often?
Hit you?
He's not nice when he drinks.
Does he drink a lot?
Every day?
I have to report this.
You know that, don't you?
He didn't do it on purpose.
I know.
But I have to report it.
He didn't do it on purpose.
No, I know.
But I have to inform the authorities.
I want to go home now.
- I can't let you go home today.
- I want to go home now.
- I understand, Sara...
- So let me out!
- Sara, it's for your own good.
- You don't get to decide for me.
- I want to go now.
- I know, but it's my duty to...
I want to go home!
We'll be on our way now.
- You were right to call us.
- Take care, Sara.
Bye.
He said, "let's all
move one place on."
And instantly moved on as he spoke.
Alice was the only one
a good deal worse off than before -
- as the March Hare had just tipped
over the milk jug into his plate.
Alice tried not to offend the Dormouse
and asked, "I don't understand..."
Okay.
Bye.
Hello.
Oh no.... no, no.
Why are you inside on a beautiful day?
Where's Mom?
- Hey, where's Mom?
- We don't know.
You're home early.
I couldn't concentrate
so I took the rest of the day off.
Come along, girls.
The sun's shining. Fresh air!
Let's go.
- Who are you?
- You know that.
What is the best thing
that ever happened to you?
Having the girls.
And the worst?
Losing my dad.
- How old were you when he died?
- 11.
He had a weak heart.
Who is your best friend?
Lina, my sister.
What is your biggest fear?
That everything will disappear.
What is your favourite dish?
- Cheese.
- Cheese isn't a dish.
Depends on how much you eat.
If you only could bring one thing
to a deserted island -
- what would you bring?
One thing?
Matches.
Clever.
Who was the first person
you had sex with?
- Do you ask everyone that?
- You have to answer all questions.
Someone it shouldn't have been.
Who?
I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
Because...
Sometimes what happens and what
must never happen are the same thing.
Like you and me?
This was fun.
I have to pick up the girls.
- Which ones do you want to open next?
- We'll open these ones.
Exciting!
- We just know they're gonna be good.
- Yes, because they're not soft.
Cool!
- They shoot water!
- Yes, it's water blasters.
- Awesome.
- So nice!
- Mom, can we try them now?
- Don't you want to open the rest?
- Afterwards.
- Please, Mama!
Okay. I'll get some water.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Not now.
- Come on...
Not here.
- What's up?
- Not here, I said!
- You're leaving?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Why do you think?
Please don't.
What the fuck are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- It's nothing.
Please stay.
He's a child! Lucas!
Now we're going to sing
the Swedish version as well, right?
First for Fanny.
Four cheers for Fanny!
And now for Frida!
Leave it. I'll do it.
What's going on?
We shouldn't talk now.
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone!
- What?
- Leave me alone!
- What?
- Stop that.
What do you mean?
Stop throwing that.
You could hit someone.
Shut up. See, I'm throwing it
at your friends, instead.
Watch out!
Gustav, come down.
You're ruining the birthday party.
- Please come down.
- What's the problem?
Stop throwing.
Stop throwing and come down
so we can continue.
- What are you afraid of?
- You're disturbing the party!
Are you afraid I'll fall and get hurt?
- Please come down.
- What is he throwing?
- Watch out! Stop.
- Stop it.
- What did you say to me?
- You could hit and hurt someone...
Gustav! Do you hear me?
Lie completely still.
Call an ambulance.
Don't move, Gustav.
- I can't feel my legs.
- Just lie still now.
- Call an ambulance!
- Have you got a phone?
Don't move. Did you
call an ambulance?
Dad, I can't feel my legs.
It's gonna be okay, Gustav.
Just lie still.
Wait... Sorry.
I was just joking.
- It was a prank.
- That's enough.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Let go of me.
Let go!
But...
What the hell's wrong with him?
We're doing everything we can,
but it doesn't get any better.
Maybe we should consider
some other options.
Like what?
Do you want me to send him away?
- I didn't say that.
- What, then?
- I don't know.
- You must have meant something.
- You said it wasn't working out.
- I can't give up on my own child.
- No.
- You just don't do that.
No. I was just trying to help.
We've known all along
it had to end sometime.
And that time is now.
Gustav. Do you understand?
Yes, I told you already.
I hope it won't ruin anything.
What do you mean?
We love having you with us.
And you mean a lot to the girls.
Sure.
- What about Peter?
- What about him?
You're not going to tell him about us?
- No, of course not.
- Okay, fine.
None of us can tell Peter
or anyone else.
- I hope we agree on that?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
We could spend some time together.
Think about it.
- Yeah, okay...
- Please.
- Hi.
- I'll consider it.
Hi.
I think I'll go up to the cabin with
Gustav and stay for a couple of days.
It would do us good to spend
some time together, just him and me.
We're thinking
about leaving tonight.
Okay?
- Wouldn't that be good?
- Sure.
You think it's a bad idea?
No. I'm just trying to understand
your priorities.
What priorities?
You've worked
all through the girls'
holiday and then
you take off with him?
- Do you want to come?
- No, we don't want to come.
- Lina called.
- She called you?
Yes.
What did she want?
She didn't leave a message. I guess
she wanted to get a hold of you?
"Take off your hat,"
the King said to the Hatter.
"It isn't mine," said the Hatter.
"Stolen!" the King shouted -
- turning to the jury, who instantly
made a memorandum of the fact.
"I keep them to sell,"
the Hatter added as an explanation.
- "I've none of my own. I'm a hatter."
- Mom?
It's just that...
Why couldn't we come along to Sweden?
Because Dad and Gustav needed
some time alone.
What do you think they're doing?
The things we usually do in the cabin.
They're fishing and cutting wood -
- swimming and making a bonfire.
Talking.
Are you coming?
We'll be late if we don't go now.
- Hi.
- Hi there.
- We're on our way to riding class.
- We brought a strawberry cake.
I tried to call but then we thought
we'd just give it a shot.
- The girls really miss Lucas.
- We've got other plans today.
- Oh...
- Okay.
But run along and say hi to him.
- I've called you many times.
- I know.
- Can't we talk?
- No, I don't really want to.
- You called Peter?
- Yes.
You're not going to tell him, are you?
Lina!
You're gonna cry now?
I won't feel sorry for you!
- It's over. It just happened.
- I don't want to hear about it!
Can't we please talk?
No, I want you to get out of here!
Girls, come along.
Come on, sweetie.
Can't we please
stay a little longer?
Today's not a good day.
Another time.
See you.
See you, Lucas.
- Bye.
- Bye bye.
Hi, darling, it's me. I just called
to see if everything's okay.
I just felt like hearing your voice.
Call me back, please.
- Are Dad and Gustav back already?
- It seems so.
- Off with your riding clothes!
- Gustav!
Hi.
- Daddy!
- Hi. Hi, girls.
- Why are you home already?
- Because I missed you so much.
- Where's Gustav?
- He went out.
- We took a taxi home.
- Why?
Mom's car is broken.
- Broken?
- Yeah, it suddenly just broke down.
We were the very last ones
to be picked up.
I'm thinking of going to the office
to fetch some papers...
You're not going anywhere.
Sit down.
I talked to Gustav.
He told me that he...
He wants to go to boarding school.
Oh.
Maybe that's a good idea.
You think so?
Well, if that's what he wants.
Yes.
I told him -
- that I was very happy to finally get
a chance to live with him.
How much I'd missed being with him
ever since he was little.
And then suddenly he broke down.
And told me...
...that the two of you...
...that you've had an affair
with my son.
Yes...
But that's insane.
You don't believe him, do you?
Right now I don't
know what to believe.
- Why say it if it wasn't true?
- Don't you see?
To get attention. That's why.
Why on earth would I want to have
an affair with your son?
It's an absurd accusation.
He told me details about the two of
you, things he can't have made up.
We're not finished yet.
I've put up with so much from him.
I've tried to treat him well -
- and I only get shit in return!
Hey.
But this I won't stand for.
I'm telling you!
- What are you doing?
- Packing.
I know he's had a rough time.
And I know he's been taught to hate me
because I stole his dad from his mom.
Stop this.
And I understand
if he wants to punish me -
- but this... this is sick!
Please stop this. Calm down.
Calm down and let's talk about this.
A normal person wouldn't make this up.
And if you believe him -
- you're not the man
I thought you were.
How dare you?!
I'll never forgive you for this.
I just told you what Gustav said.
Please...
And you'd rather
believe a boy you don't
know than the
mother of your children?
I don't know what to believe!
What am I to believe?
- Anne, please calm down...
- Don't!
Anne...
Ask your son who
broke into our house.
What?
- Gustav?
- Yes.
But I spared you because
I wanted to give him a second chance.
For the sake of both of you!
You don't understand
how people work.
You haven't got a clue!
You don't see the game he's playing.
He wants you to choose him over me
so he can have you to himself.
You're too easy to manipulate!
- Just explain to me how...
- Explain what?
I'll never convince you
it didn't happen.
You've already made up your mind.
I'll go away for a few days.
When I come back -
- I want you to move out,
and I want Gustav gone.
Please, can't we just talk about it?
There's no need to be so dramatic.
You think I'm a monster.
- What is your favourite season?
- Spring. It's getting hotter...
- Who are you?
- You know that.
What is the best thing
that ever happened to you?
We have to talk about the things
you told me in the cabin.
I know I wasn't there for you
when you were little -
- and I'm very sorry about that,
and I understand your anger, but...
It's not Anne's fault
that Rebecca and I divorced.
Our marriage had been rocky for a long
time. We were no good for each other.
We also understand it was hard for you
to come here and leave everything.
And perhaps we haven't done enough
to make you feel at home here.
And perhaps we haven't listened enough
to you and your needs.
But I just want you to know one thing:
We want to do better.
And we're here for you.
What's going on here?
Your accusations against Anne
are very, very serious.
No matter how angry you are, it's not
okay to make something like that up.
You cannot lie about
something like that.
But... Dad, I'm not lying.
Aren't you going to say anything?
Well?
- Well?!
- Gustav...
- Please.
- It's okay.
I understand that you're upset.
And that you think it's difficult.
But this...
- Why are you doing this?
- You know very well why.
No, actually, I don't.
This is...
Have you become completely deranged,
both of you?
You have lied to us.
You've stolen from us,
but enough is enough.
We're a family, Gustav, and we have
to be able to trust each other.
And if we can't, you can't live here.
It's as simple as that.
So how do you think
we should move on from here?
What are your needs?
Talk to me.
Say something!
Gustav...
He can't stay here any longer.
- We have to leave now, Fanny.
- No.
We can go visit
Gustav at the school.
No!
Yes. Come on.
- Fanny.
- Go to Mom.
Is there anything you'd like?
Excuse me?
I just asked if you needed anything.
No.
- Hi, Sara.
- Hi.
I just wanted to stop by with these.
Why are you giving me flowers?
I just want to
thank you for helping me.
But of course.
How is your dad?
I'm going to live with a foster family
until he gets better.
- They seem okay nice.
- That sounds great.
Maybe I'll call you some day
to tell you how I'm doing.
I'd really like that.
- See you.
- See you. Bye.
- And merry Christmas...
- Thank you.
Good morning.
It can seem extremely harsh
with the discipline and all.
- But I'm sure you'll find...
- Hi.
Good morning.
Shall we...?
Coming along?
Take care.
What are you doing here?
- You have to tell Peter the truth.
- That's not going to happen.
He has to know I'm not lying.
Or else I'm going to report you.
And what do you
hope to get out of that?
- Justice.
- Okay.
What exactly is it you think
I've done to you?
You're an adult.
And what are you, a child?
- Did I abuse you or?
- You're the expert. You tell me.
Did I misunderstand something?
- Didn't you want it?
- It's not about what I wanted.
What happened is illegal,
and you know that very well!
You of all people should know!
Well?
Why do you think
anyone will believe you?
Because it's true.
You haven't got a case, Gustav.
Have you?
No one's going to listen to someone
like you. You're not credible.
I think you should get over this.
Just tell your father you made it up,
and we can all move on.
And if you're not capable of
doing that, you should stay away.
4, 3, 2 -
- 1...
Go ahead and look.
A dog!
Open...
Good...
Open the door... open the door!
I want to talk to Peter.
Dad!
- You'll wake up the girls.
- Shut up... shut up!
- I don't give a shit... Move!
- No, no, no!
- Come on. Take it easy.
- Let go. Let go!
Let go! Let go of me.
I want to talk to my dad, not you.
Dad!
- Don't you come...
- Dad!
Don't you come here and wake up
the entire house, do you hear?!
Your dad can't take it anymore.
Do you understand?
Dad!
Your dad can't take any more.
Do you understand?!
You take up too much space.
You don't live here anymore.
Do you?
You should leave now.
Go away.
Dear Anne, dear birthday girl.
An old quote goes something like this:
Out of chaos comes order.
That is a fairly accurate depiction
of Anne's and my collaboration.
I think you can all envision
the distribution of roles.
Contrary to many of us, nothing
you have was just handed to you.
You have fought hard to give your girls
a better upbringing than you had -
- and the journey
you have made has
given you an
insight and a strength -
- that you apply to your work
every day -
- and which benefits everyone
lucky enough to encounter you.
Thanks.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Yeah.
It's nice.
I'm really glad you came after all.
It means a lot to me.
Thank you.
What did Rebecca want?
- She doesn't know where Gustav is.
- What do you mean?
He hasn't been at the school
since before the Christmas break.
And nobody's seen him?
No.
Has she reported him missing?
No, not yet.
- Should we send people home?
- No. Of course not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
This is your party.
- Hi, Mom.
- Why haven't you left yet?
We don't know.
Why haven't you left?
They called from
Stockholm, the police.
They want me to come up.
Why?
I don't know.
- I'll go with you.
- No. Stay with the girls.
- They can sleep over at...
- There's no need.
I think it's better if I go alone.
Rebecca will be there, too.
- Shall I drive you to the airport?
- I've called a taxi.
- Will you call me when you get there?
- Yes.
I was a hunter who found him.
Deep in the woods.
All the way up by the cabin, actually.
They think he's
been lying there for
a couple of months,
since the snowfall -
- and when the snow disappeared...
Probably he froze to death.
Maybe he got tired and...
just wanted to rest. I don't know.
I really don't know...
Maybe drugs and
alcohol were involved.
We'll have to
await the autopsy results.
They even thought that maybe he...
...that maybe...
That maybe he just
gave up and sat down.
When he lived with us... Gustav...
None of it was your fault.
It wasn't your fault.
I didn't know what to do...
Stop!
