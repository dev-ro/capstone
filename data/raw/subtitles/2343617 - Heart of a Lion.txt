HEART OF A LION
Teppo Salminen.
Teppo Salminen.
Teppo Salminen, shift supervisor?
I heard you have a criminal record.
Yes...
And how about your skills in English...
Would you consider yourself fluent?
Well...
No.
Yes.
You want more coffee?
I don't have money.
The second cup is 50 cents.
I don't have money.
Your hands are too tired to work?
My hands will do what
they need to...
but no one's going to hire them.
What will they hire?
- A head.
- You've got a head.
No, I don't. Nothing stays in it.
You mean hair?
No, knowledge doesn't stay in.
It runs in the family.
We're all boneheads.
We can't hold indoor jobs.
I did have a blow job once.
I was a glassblower
at a glass factory.
I had a colleague who was
a bit on the slow side.
His name was Kulmala.
The company wanted to sack him.
I told all my colleagues
to go on strike...
so that he could keep his job.
I was the only one
who went on strike.
- Did Kulmala get to keep his job?
- No. Neither did I.
These days I do temporary jobs.
Odd jobs.
Odd jobs.
I get off at six.
I'll take you out.
- I still don't have money.
- It's on me. It's payday.
If you play your cards right,
you'll get a piece of ass tonight.
Teppo, cum on my stomach.
Not on my bra.
How come there's so much of it?
I don't know.
I haven't had sex in
a couple of years.
Don't you jerk off?
Not really.
I haven't been in the mood.
- Who was she?
- Who?
A couple of years back?
I can't...
Tell me.
No.
Fucking hell.
- Sari?
- Get the fuck out.
Well, good morning to you too.
Hi.
Oh please.
- How do you know I don't have a man?
- Do you?
This won't work.
- Why not?
- Because I say so.
That's a shame.
Teppo.
I'm going home and
you're going home.
Take this shrubbery with you.
I'm not taking them home.
What are you doing Friday!
I'm going out with my friends.
- Are you going to Cairo or Oasis?
- Neither.
So you're going to the Barbarian?
See you there.
I'll go take a piss.
Next up: TWP...
This song is dedicated to Sari.
Would you cry out in delight
if I fucked you right
You tell me I'm too uptight to
drive with my eyes closed tonight
It ain't easy, Jack to
get that lost youth back
And that feeling is so sublime
getting drunk for the first time
Sometimes you've got
to make the choice
To listen to your own voice
Since it's so hard to
foresee in your dreams
who the winners will be
And how happiness on earth
is divided so unfairly
I'll go outside and
look at the stars...
and um...
...then I'll go home...
and I'll never disturb you
again if you don't want me to.
Thank you, Teppo.
Next up is...
What was that all about?
Get out.
I'm not serving coffee.
I'm just glad you didn't
beat me up this time.
The railing is loose.
It might be dangerous.
You have a hammer and a
couple of big nails?
And a screwdriver and
a couple of screws.
There you go.
Now it's good.
Nothing stays in your head...
but your hands seem to work.
You should have a tool
you can drill with.
- This is impossible.
- Why?
Because I have a son.
His dad didn't pull
out quick enough?
Was he a bit on the slow side?
His dick was so long...
he only got half of it
out before he came.
It's great that you have a child.
Your son can be my son.
It's not possible.
Man has been to the moon.
The US has a nigger president.
Anything is possible.
My son is a 'nigger.'
- That's a good one.
- You gotta go.
If nothing else...
you'll learn to jerk off so
that your blanket doesn't move.
For white Finland!
For white Finland!
The gearbox is fucked up.
Olli, dude. You told
me to buy a Hyundai.
I told you not to buy one
under any circumstances.
Buy a Mercedes.
Fatso, bring me a beer.
- You were checking out that chick.
- What?
You checked out at that
fuckin' mulatto chick.
Mulatto? She's just tanned.
- So you checked her out?
- She's just tanned, isn't she?
Shit!
You didn't ring it
up on the register.
You faked ringing it up.
You fucking refugee!
He doesn't ring up
beer on the register.
- He's not paying taxes.
- Olli, calm down.
Employer fees and pension fees.
Rent. And a salary.
He can't be paying all
that if a beer costs 3.50.
- Receipt. Receipt.
- What? 'Receipt. Receipt.'
He found a receipt.
A fire is a nasty thing if
you don't have insurance.
- It was water damage.
- Stay the fuck out of this!
- It was water damage.
- It was a different case!
Don't mess with my head!
It was a fucking fire.
- It was water damage.
- It was a different fucking case!
If there's a fire...
- Hey, darky! Give us a receipt.
- What?
- Give us a receipt.
- I'm out of receipt paper.
- Fucking hell!
- Calm down, buddy!
You have insurance?
There you are.
Are you afraid of me?
What do you want?
Okay.
Who I am and what I support...
- is crystallized into one thing.
- Race.
No. Honor.
You have to take care of things.
You take care of your
country, friends and family.
I just can't leave.
I told you your son could be my son.
And I mean it.
I swear.
What do you swear on?
Swear on your dick.
I swear on my dick.
Good. I'll tear it off if
you hurt my son in anyway.
Got it.
Where's the little man'!
You caught a break.
He's in Sweden with his dad.
Repetitive strain injury.
Have you been more sexually
active than normal...
in the past couple of days?
Yes, I have.
Past couple of weeks.
I need to shift.
Shoulder, arms!
Everywhere and in
all situations...
in war and peace...
I will defend the integrity
of my fatherland...
its government and parliament...
and legal authorities.
- Whoah, what's that?
- I shot well.
- Bullshit. You bought it from someone.
- What?
- C'mon. Stop.
- Right.
Don't wanna get your ass
kicked in front of your girl.
By you?
The pensioner will pay.
So, when will I become an uncle?
I gotta test-drive him first.
- You mean like, date him?
- No, bang him.
Your brother is a good fuck.
You knew that?
I never gave him any,
so I don't know.
But I hear it runs in the family.
You'll find out one day.
With some guy.
Shit. I almost got a
tear in my eye...
when that war veteran
read that oath.
Have you ever done something bad?
- In my life, you mean?
- Yeah.
Yes, I have.
Something really bad?
Yeah.
What?
I beat up a... Moroccan.
He almost ended up on a ventilator.
- Why?
- He raped this girl named Mirja.
He got probation and
I didn't think it was right.
I couldn't take it.
Did it help Mirja?
I don't want to think about it.
I want to think about you.
C'mon.
- Does my hair look good?
- Silly.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- Did you have a good time with Dad?
- Yeah.
- This is Bean.
- Morn.
This is Rhamadhani. That's Teppo.
- Teppo. Rhamadhani.
- Teppo.
Hi.
- I'll go say hi to your dad.
- Yeah.
- Are you hungry?
- No.
Why don't you eat something.
Have a banana.
I didn't mean it that way.
You can have an apple, if you like.
- Have a banana. Bananas are good.
- I'm not hungry.
Okay. I'm Teppo.
- We can shake hands.
- And I'm Rhamadhani, not Bean.
I'll go get a soda.
Alright. We'll call.
My dad said it's not worth fixing.
Oh, your dad said that?
Let's see.
I see.
This doesn't look so bad.
This is a work of top-class
German engineering.
Bean.
Hey.
Goddammit. You're grown men.
- That's the Lion of Finland...
- And a swastika.
Morning.
Manchester United vs.
Chelsea is on tonight.
- I want you to move away.
- Bean!
Why?
Only patriotic Aryan
people have lion tattoos.
It's the Lion of Finland.
- I'm proud of Finland.
- Of white Finland.
- Of Finland.
- Teppo!
- Change the subject.
- And talk about Nazis.
Talk about soccer.
- Move away.
- Bean, what did I tell you?
Great. A lovely morning.
- Thanks, guys.
- Well...
Since you like playing together,
why don't you take Bean to school
- Hey...
- Bye.
Wait.
Get in.
I can get it.
Hi.
Haven't seen you in a while.
I've been renovating the house.
The meeting's on Friday.
Everyone's coming.
I've got stuff to do.
You kind of have to come.
We got a speaker from Stockholm.
- We'll see.
- Cool house. Why don't you show us around.
We have a cat.
- You're allergic, right?
- No.
Dani, were you the allergic one?
- Reko?
- No, I'm not allergic.
- I mean I'm renovating the house.
- You should've asked for help.
- Thanks.
- Can I just take a quick look'!
There's the cat.
Could you help me with
a school project?
Sure.
- Somewhere here?
- Yeah. That's good.
We've been talking about national
symbols in the Philosophy Club...
and what they mean to people.
- Okay.
- Burn the ﬂag and I'll tape it.
A Nazi burning the Finnish
flag would be funny.
No way.
Okay, you film then.
Hey...!
What the hell are you doing, kid?
Or do you want to film a
Nazi hitting a black kid?
Bean said the basement
light is broken.
Uh-huh.
You know how to fix it?
Can you fix this?
- I'll just pop in first.
- Right.
- Sieg Heil!
- Sieg Heil!
- For white Finland!
- For white Finland!
Good job!
Foreign hot dog stand
owners are destroying...
the Finnish food industry
with their mafia-like tactics.
You didn't just stand
by and watch it;...
you defended your country.
Thank you for that.
I want to give you
something exquisite...
as a symbol of your brave battle.
Would your leader accept this?
- Teppo.
- Gum 'yob. TQM...
- For white Finland!
- For white Finland!
Islam is the real threat.
Have you heard of Eurabia?
Every Muslim living in Finland
is part of a conspiracy.
They want to make Europe Islamic.
- This dude is a real man.
- Get the fuck over here.
- He defended me when I got sacked.
- We both got sacked.
The most important thing is
that you did the right thing.
- Right, Seppo? Teppo.
- Teppo.
That's a fine statue.
Yup. I'm proud of us.
If you're going through
rough times...
remember that we'll always
help you. Always.
- Teppo!
- Be gentle.
Stop gaying around! Come listen.
Watch out! He's a virgin.
Sari.
Listen to me.
I'm telling you I'm full of shit.
And if there's something that
isn't shit in me, it's piss.
Sari.
I want to talk to you.
I don't know how to do
this dad thing at all.
You were right.
This isn't working.
Sari.
Hey, listen.
Rhamadabi!
Sari! Ramamami!
Where is she?
What happened?
- I don't...
- What happened?
They say I'm okay...
- but I can't move for a while.
- Okay.
The little baldie is fine.
Huh? The little baldie?
The little baldie. The
bald-headed son of a retard.
Sorry for not telling you sooner.
I was just so fucking pissed.
No contraception works with me.
It said that the Pill
is 99 percent reliable.
It can't depend on one
single fucking pill, can it?
I thought about getting
an abortion...
but I'm an old hag and don't
have that many years left.
I guess I might as well
have another kid now...
since he's already on the way.
What are you thinking?
What will...
What will... our kid be like.
What will he be like?
Beautiful, Beautiful like you.
And endlessly stupid like me.
But happy.
As long as he has your hands.
Teppo.
Promise me you'll
take care of Bean.
You have to take him to school
and get him after school
Make sure he's okay.
Promise me.
I promise.
So you decided to make me
an evening snack, huh?
But then your mom got hungry, huh?
It's all your fault!
We don't know if that
made her sick...
or if it was something else.
- She'll make it through.
- How do you know?
- The doctors know.
- They can be wrong.
Let's make a deal.
Neither of us tries
to kill one another...
while Sari's in the hospital.
I can move out...
when Sari comes home.
Deal?
Okay.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Wake up bright in
the morning light.
Goddammit!
Hi, Ramadummy.
- Monkeys walk on all fours.
- You slipped on a banana?
What was that all about?
My teacher says they're just
joking and that I shouldn't care.
- Why didn't you beat them up?
- All three?
It doesn't matter
how many there are.
You gotta punch first. In the head!
Then they'll stop.
They'll respect you.
What else can you do? Run off?
- It's a good alternative.
- Are you gonna run away all your life?
- When assholes like you push me around?
- Exactly.
When assholes like me push you
around, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Don't tell Mom.
We mustn't stress her out.
I'll take care of it.
I can ride in your car like this...
so you don't have to be afraid
someone's gonna see me.
Thanks.
What are they gonna do with
a piano in an apartment?
Look. Look, our boy from Africa.
This is going to be a fun night.
Pedal it hard! They're used
to running in the savanna.
They run from cheetahs.
Fuckin' cheetahs.
You get it? In Africa.
Get up.
Get up and attack me.
- Violence sucks.
- Sometimes it can help.
Get up.
Punch me hard.
Punch me.
Whoah. And that's how you fly.
Get up and try again.
And punch hard.
Not like this.
Punch straight.
You use your hip to ﬂip your
opponent to the ground.
Good.
Fight back for real.
Oh sorry. Did you get hurt?
No. Thanks.
Yeah.
You turned into a bookworm, huh?
Huh?
- You know how to read?
- Bro, goddammit.
What are you doing here?
Are you on leave?
- I took a hike.
- Uh-huh.
They're all faggots.
All of them.
- Except the lesbians.
- Right.
I'll make coffee.
- Who's that?
- He's my little brother.
He's a bit of a hard case.
Go upstairs to your room
and be quiet, okay?
- What if he comes in?
- I'll make sure he doesn't.
You have to go back.
You hear me?
You hear me?
Did you hear what I just said?
You have beer?
Oh, it's your girlfriend who
taught you how to read.
This is her grandma's house.
Harri, what the fuck?
Fucking hell!
What is this?
Harri, are you crazy?
- Come on.
- Are you crazy?
Come on, fat boy. Come on.
Huh?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What's that?
What?
Sari sponsors a kid in Africa.
Some charity shit.
- No fuckin' way.
- Yeah.
Where are you going
to spend the night?
At my dear brother's
place, of course.
I'll take you to the
barracks tomorrow.
I'll talk to them.
And you'll do what they tell you.
And you'll say 'Yes, sir.'
No fuckin' way.
"Yes, sir!"
- I won't say that!
- Yes, you will. 'Yes, sir!'
- Say it!
- Yes sir, sergeant Salminen.
Okay!
That sounds more like it.
You can sleep in the
sauna dressing room.
Okay. Let's go.
Where are the grenades?
- What grenades?
- The fuckin' hand grenades you stole!
- Get up!
- Go buy eyeglasses.
Let's go.
Our grandfather died on
the last day of the war.
Our father is a warrant officer.
I'm a sergeant myself.
It would be bad for our family
if he didn't get another chance.
Sir.
What does Private
Salminen have to say?
- I won't take orders from a Chink.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Calm down!
- What are you doing?
- You're both crazy.
- Answer him.
Tell him why you have
to finish your service.
I don't know.
Say it!
I'm a patriotic man, sir!
You're a nutcase and deserter.
We don't need people like you.
You'll be invalidated from
peace-time service...
due to maladjustment.
What...
Are you giving me C papers?
I'm not a fucking looney!
I'm not a fucking C man!
Fucking looney papers!
Give your looney papers
to the fucking Chink!
You may leave your equipment
here and then leave.
One, two, three.
Attention! Finger to the right!
Times have definitely changed.
Lesbians, gays and
immigrants in the army.
Where are the grenades?
I stuck them up my ass.
But that's alright...
'cause my dear brother has
assfucked me all my life.
I asked you where the grenades are!
Where did you put them?
Huh?
I detonated them at the sandpit.
I would've just gotten
into trouble over them.
You sure?
Who do you think I am?
- Hey, I have to tell you...
- Open the door. Open the fucking door!
I have to tell you something.
Goddammit.
Wait, for fuck's sake! Harri!
Rhamadhabi.
This is my brother Harri.
Harri, this is Ramababi.
Sari's son from her
previous relationship.
Seems to be.
He sure doesn't look
like our grandpa.
- Hello, hello. jambo, jambo.
- Hi.
Harri, I'll kill you
if you hurt that boy.
You won't say anything about him.
You won't touch him or his things.
You understand?
You'll use the upstairs bathroom.
This side is for whites.
That side is for non-whites.
You understand?
Peaceful coexistence.
Goosefoot.
There are other plants,
for example, pineapple weed...
field pansy and bittercress.
Who can learn all these?
"'I too once passed through
the Dimrill Gate...
said Aragorn quietly."
How long is your
brother going to stay?
For now.
He'll calm down. Don't
take it personally.
He's not used to this.
He'll never get used to it.
Well, it took me a while, too.
I'll kill him.
Don't kill him.
Okay, put your head on the pillow.
Whoah.
Were you thinking of
making salmon fillets?
I'm scared.
Are you gonna make
scars on his face?
Or will you stab him
in the stomach?
If you stab from above,
the ribs are in the way.
You have to stab from below.
Like this. Or like this.
You understand?
Good night, nigger monkey.
Good night, Nazi loser.
Nazi loser...
- You want to get your ass kicked again?
- Yes, I do.
And I want to invite the
guys over to drink beer...
and get to know my new nephew.
Or maybe I don't want
to get my ass kicked...
or invite the guys over.
What are we gonna do?
It should read "Pinks only"
on the bathroom door.
You can play with this.
How's everything?
- Everything's good.
- You sure? At school too?
Yeah.
- So?
- Everything's good.
- Is that his ass?
- No.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Do I get to go home?
- No.
- Not until your blood proteins are normal.
- Fuck.
And unfortunately it
might take a while.
- If that wasn't his ass, what was it?
- The head.
He looks like me!
- Let's go.
- Who ripped your shirt?
- I fell.
- Who did it?
I fell.
Where are you going?
- You just lost your superiority.
- We were just joking!
You see me laughing?
I have no sense of humor.
- I wasn't in it!
- Now you are. Give me your shirt.
Give your ripped one to him.
Give me your shirt!
Stop wriggling.
Make it quick!
I don't have all day.
Alright.
Don't let it happen again.
Hi. I'm Aleksi Rämö.
I'm here to get my son Aki's shirt.
Aki can keep the shirt he ripped.
No way!
You're gonna get your ass kicked!
Harri!
Harri!
Hold him!
What?
You fat fuck.
Let him go. Let him go.
What do you say?
Please, dear brother.
That's it.
Okay, weakling.
I'll show you one thing.
In case someone attacks you.
Get up.
- Get up.
- Harri.
Get up, will you?
Attack me.
No, no.
Attack me or you'll regret it.
Punch me!
Grab his arm, put it behind
his back and twist it hard.
Thanks for coming!
Better luck next time!
- Thanks.
- Sorry for being such a piece of shit.
You're a good stepdad.
You're not moving away, are you?
No.
Never.
It never even crossed my mind.
Hi.
We heard your stepdad
got beat up by Aki's dad.
- They said he's a loser.
- How do you feel about it?
What are you doing here,
little monkey?
A wuss like his dad.
Rhamadhani is a danger
to the other children...
and that's why he's
suspended for one week.
The school board will decide
about further measures.
Who else will be suspended?
Rhamadhani will be suspended.
That's not gonna happen.
- Excuse me?
- I fuckin' said that's not gonna happen.
As an educator, I must set
limits on our children.
You can suspend the bullies,
but Rhamadhani will stay.
Parents may often feel that
their child is being bullied...
and that the other
kids are bullies.
But is it really that simple?
Rhamadhani's dad
isn't in the country...
- so we'll send the papers to his mom.
- No, you won't!
It's that simple!
Write it down.
Listen, I'm sure we can
discuss this like adults.
I'm just doing what
you forgot to do.
How long are you
going to stay here?
Until college.
Dad!
What's up, dude'!
Nice to see you. Here you are.
Our Swedish colleagues
ruin everything.
- I constantly have to tell them what to do.
- I see.
Stockholm is a nice
place, isn't it?
Vegetable patties for you.
I also have friends in Stockholm.
- The women there are beautiful.
- I'm sure.
Rhamadhani, eat something.
I'm Salif.
Harri, say hello so you don't
look like a total retard.
Fuck off.
You're in the army, right?
Having the time of your life?
Okay, maybe boot camp
wasn't that fun.
But the Reserve Officer
School is cool.
- Alrighty.
- What's wrong with you?
Is he always like that?
He hates niggers.
Uh-huh. The master
doesn't like black men.
The black man isn't as
civilized as the master.
The black man can
only do buga-buga.
- Buga, buga. Homo, buga, homo, buga.
- Dad. Stop.
Finnish racism stems
from small dicks.
Shut the fuck up, refugee.
Soy sausages, anyone?
I was a refugee when I was a baby.
Now I'm a Finnish citizen
and a second lieutenant...
and I pay more in taxes than you
get from the welfare office.
You're on welfare, right?
Fuck. Stop fucking with me,
for fuck's sake.
I'm just joking.
Salif, eat a vegetable patty.
You can get better
acquainted next time.
If the distributor is broken,
the car won't start.
- Is this the distributor?
- Yes.
We'll put some of this and...
- Go wash your hands.
- Why?
If you have a sore on your hand...
you might get blood poisoning
from the oil and dirt. Go quick.
Wash for a long time.
With warm water.
Alright!...
We got some unfinished shirt
business from last time.
- I didn't say what I had to say.
- Say it then!
Put that away and I'll say it.
- Don't move.
- Put it away.
Put that axe away!
Get him!
- Where are you?
- Stop, goddammit!
At the club?
- I have a slight situation here.
- Fight, you coward!
Morons.
You should go home
while you still can.
Get the fuck out.
First we'll distribute
a little justice.
What kind of justice is it...
when he tore the shirt
off my son's back?
- We want the shirt back!
- Shut up, fatso!
Let him be. He'll shit his pants.
What's wrong with you?
As long as you have the
lion on your chest...
none of these garden
gnomes will bother you.
Hey, hey.
I think we got off on
the wrong foot here.
Who are you? Mickey Mouse?
I'm sure we can sort
this out like adult men.
I have 200 euros here.
What's your name?
Okay, let's forget about names.
400 euros.
I'm sure we can sort
this out with 400 euros.
I'll put the money on the ground...
and then we'll leave.
- 400 euros?
- Yes.
That means Tare and Hippo
can have a day off.
What?
Then we're even.
Get them!
- You fight with girls?
- No.
Fat fuck. Get over here.
Good night!
Just get out of here, guys.
Shit! Goddammit!
Harri, let it be.
- He kicked you from behind.
- Let it be.
What? What the fuck!
- For white Finland!
- For white Finland!
- For white Finland!
- For white Finland!
- For white Finland!
- For white Finland!
Goddammit, that felt good.
Those gypsies piss me off too!
Those fuckin' granny
purse snatchers!
Our grandmas built this country.
They gave everything.
They sacrificed the most precious
thing they had: their sons.
What's wrong with you?
And then those fucking
darkies come here...
- and steal their milk money. Is it right?
- No!
You want to tell the guys
why we beat those men up?
You're our leader.
They're rapists and criminals.
- What about Mirja? Huh?
- Don't talk about her!
- What about Mirja?
- Isn't it time they learned their lesson?
Isn't it time they
learned their lesson?
We'll teach them a lesson!
Get the fuck out!
Fuck yeah!
Fuckin' ay!
You freeloaders!
Teppo.
Can you read the lord
of the Rings to me?
Yeah. Yeah.
I made myself an evening
snack and brushed my teeth.
Good job.
You can call me Rhamu.
It's probably easier for you.
Give me a cigarette.
One won't hurt.
Rhamu, please go wait downstairs.
Whenever I get close to
people, everything breaks.
Mirja started acting weird.
When I touched her...
she trembled as if she was hurting.
She didn't want to look
me in the eye anymore.
She shut me out and
wouldn't let me help her.
Was she your girlfriend?
- It wasn't your fault.
- Yes, it was.
It was.
She was raped because of me.
Or because of what I am.
They...
The Moroccans...
raped her as revenge
against me. Or against us.
Against all the patriotic
people who beat them up.
And you retaliated?
It felt good.
Everything breaks in my hands.
All the people I
love have to suffer.
I'll plated you from it all
whatever you might fear
There's no darkness in this
world that my hand can't defy
Rhamu.
I'll never hit another
person again.
- I promise.
- No matter what happens?
No matter what happens.
I don't want you to
hit anyone either.
- Not even bullies at school?
- No.
No one. Not even them.
- Can I play?
- Yeah, take your shirt off!
The shirtless team is in deep shit!
Shoot!
There's two of us.
This is Rhamu.
He's my son now.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Take your shirt off, Rhamu.
Okay.
Rhamu, go up front!
Get in the box!
Good job!
A new game? 1-0.
He's my son.
A chocolate drop.
Let's go, for fuck's sake.
Will you play ball?
Harri.
I don't get you.
You got monkeys
disgracing your garden.
The only person
disgracing me is you.
- Are you ashamed of me?
- Yes.
And of me.
You have to move out.
You can go to Stockholm
and sell your ass.
Or kill yourself. I don't care.
- How's school?
- Good.
You sure?
- Yeah. I got 9 out of 10 in history.
- Good.
Put it there. You
know how to do it.
Oh hi, good old Nazi idiot!
I heard your service
didn't go that well.
Was counting to three
too difficult for you?
- Harri.
- Dad.
Harri.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Hey, just joking!
What's wrong with you?
Can't you white men laugh?
I also got a joke.
- Are you still laughing, nigger?
- Rhamu, go inside.
No.
- Put the grenade away.
- Go.
Sit down. Have a
beer and calm down.
Put the safety pin back
and give me the grenade.
Give me the grenade.
Harri, put the safety pin back.
Now!
Just joking.
Fatally funny.
Have a pancake.
Go eat on the hammock.
Alright.
Well, he's like that.
Rhamu, c'mon.
Show me how high you can
make the helicopter fly.
Okay.
- How fast is your car?
- 6 hours to drive across our fatherland.
Nigger, don't use the
word 'fatherland.'
Don't mess with me, loser.
You'll come in second.
- You're not the sharpest pencil in the box.
- Shut up, Salif.
You also think niggers
don't have a fatherland?
- I don't care. just shut up.
- Or you'll shut me up?
Go ahead. I'm not scared.
You're a coward and a wuss.
And a loser like your brother.
- Look, it's flying over the house!
- Good job! It's pretty powerful.
- Harri!
- Dad!
Dad!
Good morning. I've got
news from the hospital.
The boy's father is
going to make it.
He got a couple of scratches...
but I'm sure he'll be able to
pick coconuts next summer.
For the last time:
where's your brother?
You can't fix these buildings.
They're all moldy or collapsed.
Let's get a loan and buy
them back from the bank.
We'll tear them down and
build something new.
- You'd have something useful to do.
- Right. "Let's get a loan."
Our father's farm.
Our fatherland.
Our grandfather's stove.
Our grandfather's stones.
Don't your stones
look like grandpa's?
At least they're damn wrinkled.
And shiny.
And blue.
Shiny.
So, how's the...
How's the little weakling?
Well, of course he got scared.
But he's alright.
You want to go somewhere
before we go to the police?
I can buy you a blow job
from that Russian whore...
who lives above the pizzeria.
Gee, thanks. She's
like 60 or something.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to apologize to me.
You're my brother.
Half-brother.
Half a brother.
Half a man.
- Just a C man.
- Hey.
A pile of shit.
Funny I should mention that.
Our grandfather's land.
You would've done the same for us.
Who are?
Goddammit!
What the hell?
What happened? Are you alright?
Yeah, it's nothing.
What do you mean it's nothing?
Teppo, goddammit. Hey.
What the hell are
you laughing about?
Bean, there's nothing funny here.
Close your eyes.
Sorry for the mess.
