I got the Strangler. Wabash and Van Buren.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!
Jack, get the van.
Eddie, help me!
Eddie, Eddie, don't leave me! God, no!
Give it up, Ray. It's over.
Oh, God, I'm dying.
You hear this, you son of a bitch?
I'm gonna get you for it!
I'm gonna get you,
and I'm gonna get Eddie, no matter what!
I gotta find somebody.
I gotta find somebody.
I don't know. I gotta find somebody.
Gotta find somebody.
Give me the power, I beg of you!
I have no friends. No one will play with me.
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.
Hey, cheer up.
- Who are you?
- I'm a Good Guy.
I've just come from the Good Guy Clubhouse,
and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will? You mean you'll be my friend now?
Sure, I will.
Hidey-ho.
I saw this one.
Hidey hidey ho

Mommy, wake up.
Mommy.
Mommy, wake up.
Mommy, wake up.
- Wake up, Mommy. Wake up.
- Andy.
What time is it, Andy?
- Wake up.
- 6:30. It's only 6:30 in the morning.
But it's a beautiful day outside. See?
It certainly is.
- How long you been up, birthday boy?
- Since forever.
I made you breakfast in bed.
You did? Oh, God.
Well, thanks.
Well, this looks just excellent.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?
Mmm-hmm.
But first, I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.
Come here. Come here. Come here.
That's one.
How many years old are you today? Two.
Happy birthday, pumpkin.
Thanks. Can we open my presents now, Mommy?
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!
Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour,
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious
Lake Shore Strangler was shot and killed
shortly before 3:00 a.m.
this morning on Wabash Avenue.
Can I open this first, Mommy? Can I, can I?
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?
Okay, go ahead.
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.
I think they're gonna be okay. We'll just
have to take them up just a couple of inches.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Oh, I know. You want some toys, don't you?
Not boring old clothes.
Try the other one.
Well, what do you think?
- I want a Good Guy to go with it.
- I know you do, Andy.
But I didn't know about it
in time this month to save up for it.
- Karen.
- Hi.
You know that doll that you wanted for Andy?
- The one that costs 100 bucks?
- Yeah, the Good Guy doll.
There is a peddler in the alley behind
the store, and I think he's got one.
What? What would a peddler
be doing with a doll?
Who cares? Would you grab your purse
and come on? We can get a deal on it.
- But I can't just leave my counter.
- Do you want the damn doll or don't you?
- Of course I do.
- Well, then, come on.
- Come on.
- All right.
There he is.
Okay, show her.
Well, is it a Good Guy or not?
It is. It is.
- Yeah, well, I told you.
- How much do you want for it?
50 bucks.
- 10 and not a penny more.
- 30.
What, are you kidding?
That thing is not worth $30.
Enough. Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.
- I'll take it.
- Karen, it's too much money.
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.
But we don't even know
if the damn thing works.
Here you go, lady.
May it bring you and your kid a lot of joy.
- Thank you.
- Hey, hold on, you!
How do we know the damn thing isn't stolen?
- Steal this.
- Steal this yourself.
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.
Come on. We gotta get back to work.
Andy's gonna love it!
Mrs. Barclay, so nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?
I'm sorry, Mr. Criswell.
I was only gone for a minute.
Have a heart, Criswell. We were just downstairs
buying her little boy a birthday present.
We have specified break times
for activities like that, Miss Peterson.
Mrs. Howe has taken sick,
and we're shorthanded tonight.
You'll have to fill in for her.
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care center in an hour.
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Wait a second. I'll take over for her.
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.
You'll just simply have to do it.
Now, you can take off at 5:00,
but you'll have to be back at 9:00.
It's my son's birthday.
Mrs. Barclay,
are you happy with your job here?
Yes, of course I am.
- Then I suggest that...
- Hey. Chill out, would you, Walter?
- I'll take care of Andy for you.
- Maggie, you can't do it again.
Don't be silly.
It'll be the hottest date I've had in months.
I can't imagine why.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Good Guys are on TV.
Well, I may have something better for you.
What?
This isn't groceries.
A Good Guy! I knew it!
I knew you'd get me one.
Show me how he works, okay?
Hi, I'm Andy. What's your name?
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.
Wow! He's something, isn't he?
Oh, Mom, thanks.
You're welcome, honey.
See, that's how you build things.
...WDOL with a late breaking report.
Eddie Caputo,
repeated accomplice of Charles Lee Ray,
has just escaped
the Michigan Avenue precinct.
More details to follow
on the news at 9:00 next.
Hey, Chucky, you're not watching me.
Hey, wanna play?
Hey, it's time for bed, Andy.
No, sir. Never saw the little swab before.
Come on, Chucky.
We have to get ready to go to bed.
I'm not a stowaway. Mr. Ghoo brought me here.
And who might Mr. Apple be?
Aunt Maggie,
Chucky wants to watch the 9:00 news.
Sure he does.
Okay, kid, off we go.
Come on. There we go.
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.
You, too. Off we go.
Now, it's brush your teeth
and under the covers with you.
Okay? Agreed?
Good. Okay.
You yell when you're ready
for me to tuck you in.
Hey, Chucky, want to see my room?
Andy, are you brushing your teeth?
Yes, Aunt Maggie.
Good.
And now, Action News at 9:00.
In Washington today,
the mayor replied that he would study
the congressional findings carefully
and have the commission on gang-related
violence issue recommendations to him.
Back to you, Steve.
Thank you, Terry.
In other news,
police have now clarified the information
regarding the escape of Eddie Caputo.
Authorities say that
Caputo managed to elude his captors
while being transferred onto a prison bus
on his way to court. Of course...
Okay, mister, what do you have
to say about this?
- About what?
- Come on. Come on.
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it
when I told you it was time to go to bed.
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, no? What did Chucky do?
Walk into the living room
and turn it on all by himself?
Did you do that, Chucky?
Andy, stop it.
Now, come on, under the covers. Hurry.
- But, Auntie...
- Under the covers and not another word.
But I didn't put Chucky in front of the TV.
Enough. Okay?
Give me a kiss.
Good night, baby, and happy birthday.
Good night, Aunt Maggie.
I told you she'd be mad at you
if you watched the news.
I missed you, my dear.
I was afraid you weren't going to show up.
Too bad about the accident.
Yes. Papa told us they just found it.
How did you know?
I must have heard it somewhere.
I haven't seen you in so long, darling.
I mean, couldn't we take a little walk,
or something?
It looks as though you haven't had
a breath of fresh air in days.
- A walk?
- Of course.
The air outside will do you good.
Besides, you'll work up an appetite.
Please.
But, Janice, surely it's going to rain.
Andy?
Depends on whether there's an indictment.
Well, they don't always...
Andy, is that you?
How did that happen?
Uh... Hello?
Hi. How's it going? How's Andy?
Karen?
Yeah. Who else would it be?
Is something wrong?
Uh...
No.
Everything's fine.
Are you sure?
You don't sound like everything's fine.
No, I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies. You know?
Now, would you stop worrying
and give Criswell a kick in the pants for me?
You got it.
Hey, listen, Maggie.
Thank you for everything.
You're a real pal.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, yeah. Give Andy a kiss for me,
will you? See you soon. Bye.
What is wrong with me?
I'm scaring myself half to death.
Step away from this barricade.
Come on, move it back.
There's nothing to see.
Now, let's move this police line back here.
Go on home, folks, please.
She was on the sixth floor.
Miss, what do you think you're doing?
I live here.
Andy?
Oh, no. Andy?
Andy?
Andy!
Mommy!
Oh, thank God.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm so glad. I got so scared when I...
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?
- She had an accident.
- Accident? What kind of an accident?
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm Detective Mike Norris, Homicide.
Could I talk to you out in the hall?
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please?
I'll be right back.
Look, Mrs. Barclay...
What?
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.
Oh, no.
You all right?
- Yes.
- All right.
Come on.
Oh, Maggie.
Did you check over here?
Oh, Maggie.
You got any idea what these are?
No.
They look like footprints, don't they?
Very small footprints.
What are you implying?
I don't know.
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?
- What?
- Besides,
I already checked his closet.
None of his shoes matched these prints.
Mommy? Mommy?
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.
Andy, I want you to go to bed.
The detective and I are very busy.
- But, Mom...
- Right now, please.
Andy.
What do you got on your feet?
Good Guy PJ sneakers.
Wow. Come here.
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.
Look at this. There's a gun.
Is that a cowboy hat?
Andy, get into bed. I'll be in
in a minute to tuck you in.
- But, Mom...
- Right now.
Why are you treating Andy like this?
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those
footprints. If not Andy, then who?
I don't know, and I don't care.
All I know is that I've just lost my best
friend tonight to a horrible accident
and I would like some time alone with my son,
who I'm sure is just as upset
about this as I am.
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll clear everybody out of here
right away. Okay?
Hey, guys, you done? Let's go. Chop-chop.
Let's go, everybody. Out of here.
Let's clear this up over here. Come on.
Okay.
Let's go, Sid.
What do you think was so important
about my sneakers, Chucky?
You don't know either, do you?
Well, let me know if you find out
anything about those footprints.
Mommy, Mommy.
Mommy, I know who was
on the kitchen counter. I know, I know.
- Andy, I thought I...
- Who, Andy? Who?
Chucky!
Your doll?
Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.
Now, come on, back to bed. Now I mean it.
But, Mom...
Good night, Detective.
- What?
- Are you gonna call me?
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just... I hate loose ends.
And I hate people
who don't know when to stop.
Ouch.
- A spirited lady.
- No kidding.
I want that autopsy report on my desk
- first thing tomorrow.
- Yeah.
And anything you can find out
about Mrs. Barclay and her son.
You got it.
Anything else I can do for you, sir?
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.
No.
Come on. You're kidding me.
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?
'Cause she saw you walking and talking?
I guess there was no hiding from her.
Andy, who are you talking to?
Chucky.
Chucky, huh?
Yeah, sure, Chucky.
He's sitting right over there.
Chucky's been talking to you, too, hasn't he?
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray,
and he's been sent down from heaven
by Daddy to play with me.
He has, has he? Anything else?
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie was a real bitch
and got what she deserved.
Andy, how can you say something so horrible?
I didn't say it. Chucky did.
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up.
- But I'm not. Chucky's alive. Really, he is.
- Andy, Chucky... Chucky's a doll.
He's made of plastic and stuffing.
Look at him. Look at him.
Now, does he look like anything else to you?
Don't, you'll hurt him.
Andy, look!
Now you don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?
But he is.
Andy, stop it. Please.
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.
I'm sorry.
I'll stop making up stories.
Thanks, champ.
Do you wanna sleep in with me tonight?
No, it's all right.
I've got Chucky.
Come on, into bed.
Good night, sweetheart.
I love you.
Good night.
You're right, Chucky. She didn't believe me.
Hi. I like to be hugged.
Good. I'd love to hug you, too.
Hey.
You sure you're all right about last night?
No bad dreams about Aunt Maggie?
And Chucky's only a doll, right?
All right, off to school with you, then.
I love you tons.
43rd street. Next stop, 47th.
Is that Eddie's?
Look, you stay here. I have to go tinkle.
I'll be right there, Chucky.
Chucky?
Chucky?
Chucky?
Chucky?
Chucky?
Chucky?
Chucky?
Chucky?
Mrs. Barclay.
Detective Norris,
I came as soon as I got your message.
You haven't been to the school
to pick up your son yet?
- No. No, I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.
I...
I don't know how to tell you this,
Mrs. Barclay.
Tell me what?
Do you have any idea why
your Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?
'Cause she saw Chucky,
and it scared her so much, she fell out.
Oh, she did, huh?
So why did Chucky go to see Eddie Caputo?
Mommy!
Oh, Andy.
All right, sweetheart. Come on.
Now listen to me, okay?
Nobody believes you about Chucky.
Unless you start telling the truth right now,
they're going to take you away from me.
You hear that, Chucky?
They're taking me away
unless you say something.
Please, say something.
Come on, Chucky. Say something.
Tell me why you lied to me about everything.
Come on, Chucky. Say something.
Tell me.
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose.
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.
Mrs. Barclay, my name is Dr. Ardmore.
I'm from County General.
I've seen more than enough.
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.
Well, say something, you little bastard.
Say something, damn it!
Hi. I like to be hugged.
"He wants you for a best friend."
Yeah, sure.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
Talk to me.
Come on, talk.
I said, talk to me, damn it. All right.
Then I'm gonna make you talk!
I said talk to me, damn it,
or else I am gonna throw you in the fire!
You stupid bitch! You filthy slut!
- I'll teach you to fuck with me!
- No! No!
Stop!
No.
No.
No!
Detective Norris!
Mrs. Barclay, what are you doing back here?
Andy was telling the truth.
Chucky is alive and he killed Eddie Caputo.
- What?
- I took him home to my apartment.
I was about to throw away the box that
he came in when the batteries fell out.
Don't you see?
He's been moving and talking for days
without any batteries in him.
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll was alive.
See, I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace,
when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.
I dropped him, and he got up
and ran out of the apartment.
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
Wait a minute. I am telling you the truth.
- He killed Maggie. He killed Eddie Caputo.
- Look, Mrs. Barclay.
I sympathize with you. I really do.
I hated what happened in there today.
- But lying is not gonna help your son.
- Lying? Does this look like I'm lying?
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.
Oh, for God's sake.
All right, don't believe me.
- Where you going?
- To find Chucky.
How you gonna do that?
I bought him from a peddler where I work.
I'll start there.
That isn't a good part of town
to be in at this time of night.
Mrs. Barclay, do you hear me?
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night.
God damn it.
What's she doing here?
Hey, excuse me.
Mister.
Mister.
I'm not gonna hurt you. Do you remember me?
- No, no.
- I'm sorry. I bought a doll from you
in back of Carson's department store
with my friend yesterday.
- Doll?
- Yes, a Good Guy doll.
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?
I don't have much,
but you're welcome to whatever I have.
It's not enough. What else you got?
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?
- What are you... Yes.
- That's not all you got.
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.
No. No, no.
No. Wait. No, no!
Pig!
- Christ, he's a cop!
- All right. What about the rest of you?
You wanna party, too?
All right. Now, you want to answer
the lady's question now?
- Where did you get the doll from?
- I don't know nothing about no doll.
You're not gonna know nothing
about nothing in a minute,
unless you talk to me. Now talk!
A burned-out toy store on Wabash.
That's where I got it.
Get out of here.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Well, wait a minute. Something
the peddler said upset you. What was it?
I just told you, nothing.
God damn it. My son's life is at stake.
Now, what was it?
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.
Who?
The Lake Shore Strangler. The man
who's partners with Eddie Caputo.
- Hey. Where are you going now?
- Wabash and Van Buren.
There's nothing there.
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.
Why don't you believe me?
It was struck by lightning
the night that Charles Lee Ray died.
How do you know that?
Because I was there.
I was the man who killed him.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.
Come on, let me take you home.
You need some sleep.
Did he say anything? Anything at all?
- Who?
- Charles Lee Ray.
Yeah. He threatened
to kill me and Eddie Caputo.
I'm sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.
I really am.
But I did.
I found out that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.
- Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?
Look, please,
will you just get out of the car?
Hey, just tell me where he lived.
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.
930 Stoney Island, the south side.
But I've already checked the place out.
There's nothing there. Now, good night.
Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- Home, to get some sleep.
- No, you can't do that.
Don't you see? You just said it.
Chucky killed Caputo. That leaves you.
- That does it.
- Please listen to me.
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth.
Why won't you believe me?
Because I'm sane, Mrs. Barclay.
Sane and rational.
All right. All right.
Do you remember what you said
the first night you met me in my apartment?
- What about it?
- You said you didn't like loose ends.
Well, I'm a loose end.
You can't just let go what I said tonight
without checking it out.
For the last time, Mrs. Barclay, good night.
Good night, asshole.
Jeez, look out!
Hi, Mikey.
Won't do you any good, Mikey.
You can't hurt me.
Karen.
What are you doing here?
After I talked to you last night,
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky,
and he spent a lot of time with this man.
Now, all we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.
Hello, John.
Over here.
Hi.
It's me. Chucky.
What do you think? The grigri work?
You know, when I came here learning
all that stuff about how to beat death,
I thought maybe you were pulling my chain.
But not now. Not now.
- Only one problem.
- What?
This. I didn't think anybody could hurt me.
But last night, I got shot.
You know something? It hurt.
It hurt like a son of a bitch. It even bled.
Now why's that, John?
- You're turning human.
- What?
The more time you spend in that body,
the more human you'll become.
You mean I have to live out
the rest of my life in this body?
No fucking way.
You got me into this, you get me out.
- I can't do that, Chucky.
- Why not?
Because you're an abomination,
an outrage against nature.
You perverted everything
I've taught you and used it for evil.
And you have to be stopped.
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?
Your own personal mojo, doc.
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it? Broken leg?
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this, John.
Gets you in trouble every time.
Now how do I get out of this body?
- No, I won't tell you.
- Yeah?
Tell me or die, John. Your choice.
No, I'll tell you.
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll
into that of the first human being
you revealed your true self to.
You mean the first person I let in
on the fact that I was really alive?
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.
The first person I let in on my little secret
was a six-year-old kid.
I'm gonna be six years old again.
Well, John, it's been fun, but I gotta go.
I have a date with a six-year-old boy.
And you have a date with death.
So long, John.
Hold it. Wait, wait.
Oh, my God.
- Too late.
- What?
Must save the boy. Must...
Must get his soul...
into him like he got into doll.
What?
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.
Kill him before he can say it.
But how? How?
The heart. His heart is almost human.
It's the only way. Through the heart.
Help me! Help me! Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!
Help me! He's coming to kill me!
He's here. Chucky's here.
I don't see anybody.
But, Doctor, Chucky's here,
and he's going to kill me.
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!
He's going to kill me.
Please don't leave me. Please.
No!
- Andy, stop.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Stop him!
Check the north corridor.
Easy. Easy, it's all right, Andy.
It's all right.
You're not gonna
need this anymore, all right?
But I do. Chucky's in the room,
and he's trying to kill me.
No, Andy. It's gonna be all right.
I'm here now.
And I'm gonna protect you.
Andy. Easy, boy. Easy.
Come on, nobody's here.
- No, please. He'll kill you, too.
- Andy, now...
No, please. Listen to me. Please.
Andy, now this is just gonna
sting you for one second.
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop.
What happened?
Look, miss, could you just
excuse us for a minute here, all right?
What?
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine and then he escaped.
Escaped? Where?
We don't know, but I bet she does.
Chucky. You seen Chucky anywhere?
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.
The same one that was at the station house.
Have you seen him anywhere?
What am I gonna know about a doll?
Where are you going?
They think Andy did it.
I know, the girl said that Chucky was here,
and that he was looking for Andy.
- But where would Andy go?
- He'd go home.
I always told him to go there
if he was in trouble.
- Does he have a key?
- It's under the mat.
Come on. Come on. We don't have much time.
Look, George.
- Some child left their doll in the elevator.
- Leave it alone.
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.
Ugly doll.
Fuck you.
Surprise!
Batter up!
Give me the power, I beg of you.
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
- Andy!
Andy, can you hear me?
Andy!
Andy!
Andy.
Karen, Karen, are you all right?
Oh, Mike.
Just take care of Andy.
Karen, Karen.
- Take this. Take it.
- Mike!
Mommy.
What's wrong? Gun jammed?
Andy!
Andy, help me. The matches.
Andy!
Please! Now!
Andy, no, please.
We're friends to the end. Remember?
This is the end, friend.
Oh, my baby.
Karen? Andy?
You all right?
Andy, go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast. Okay?
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Chucky's dead.
Mommy, Chucky's gone.
Andy, hurry up.
Andy.
Hello, Andy.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy!
Give me the boy, and I'll let you live.
Do you hear me? Give me the boy.
Mommy!
Give me the boy.
What the hell's going on here?
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
- Karen.
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah, I got a cop down here.
Multiple stab wounds.
The Brewster Apartments
on North Grand Street. Make it fast.
All right, they're gonna be here in
10 minutes. Now, tell me what happened.
The kid was right. The doll's alive.
- He almost got the three of us.
- Come on, what are you talking about?
You don't believe me? All right,
well, go on. Check it out in the hall.
It's scattered all over the place.
But don't touch it. Do you understand me?
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right, look. Take it easy, okay?
Just relax yourself, all right? All right.
Okay, Mike. I'd like you to take a look
at this thing, okay?
Because there's no way this thing's alive.
- I thought I told you not to touch it.
- Mike, will you be sensible?
Come on, look.
It's as dead as they come. It's dead.
Choke him! Kill him!
I'll rip his throat out.
Kill him!
Kill him.
Kill him now! Strangle him! Don't let go!
God.
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!
The heart. Shoot him in the heart.
Hi, I'm Chucky.
Wanna play?
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.
But who's gonna believe me?
Come on.
All right. Ready? Here we go.
Come on.
Andy.
Come on.
We're gonna go to the hospital with Mike.
Let's go.
