THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS
A film by Theo Angelopoulos
The play you are about to see
in five acts
is Spyridon Peresiades'
immortal idyll
"Golfo the Shepherdess",
with a superb cast
of famous actors,
both seasoned players
and others who are young.
The love of Golfo,
tragic and profound,
deep in your heart
will resound.
In the fall of l952
we returned to Aegion.
A few veterans,
but mostly younger actors.
We were tired.
We hadn't slept for two days.
LONG LIVE MARSHAL PAPAGOS!
THE SAVIOUR OF THE NATION
If we don't want to see
our streets
If we don't want
another Red December...
We must all rally
around the Marshal.
With your vote you can make
this coming Sunday,
the l6th of November 1952,
a historic day.
A day of victory for
the national forces.
This is why you must vote
for Papagos.
By voting for him you vote for
the only national candidate.
For the man who led our
army to victory...
against the communist
rebels in l947-49.
A vote for the Marshal
is a vote for peace,
prosperity, law and order.
Tomorrow afternoon...
The Minister of Propaganda
of the Third Reich, Goebbels,
accompanied by loanis Metaxas,
our National Leader,
will pass through our town
on his way to ancient Olympia.
The National Youth
Organization
invites everybody
to welcome him,
suitably and respectably
dressed for the occasion."
Ioannina
Lefkada, Xanthi...
Leave it, father.
I'll do it.
Write down the dates too.
You will come back.
No matter how many years go by,
you will come back,
full of remorse,
to ask forgiveness.
One night in shame
you will come back.
It won't come out!
Why is everyone happy
and smiling, father?
Why don't you get
your little bastard.
Dammit!
Why is the sun so bright today?
Because on a golden day
like this, my child
the black tears stopped,
old wounds were healed.
The wheat grew tall.
And the stones turned into
flowers and golden streams.
Left turn!
Forward march!
Why? Didn't you like it?
You will come back.
No matter how many years go by,
you will come back,
full of remorse,
to ask forgiveness.
Broken-hearted,
you will come back.
Why is everyone happy
and smiling, father?
Why is the sun so bright today?
Why is the day so clear?
Because on a golden day
like this, my child
the black tears stopped,
old wounds were healed.
The wheat grew tall
and the stones turned into
flowers and golden streams.
You, this way.
In room 15, the others in l7!
The day has come and in the
dawn the morning star has set.
The peaks are drenched in
sunlight and nightingales sing.
Partridges bathe in the streams
but the proudest partridge
of them all,
the beautiful Golfo,
has not appeared.
But here she comes!
Good day to you, Tassos.
Welcome beautiful partridge
for whom my eyes languished.
Good day to you, Golfo.
They might be watching!
No one can see us
save the birds of the forest.
And the birds?
Not like that... scared... the
way your mother would say it.
No one can see us
save the birds of the forest
and the surrounding peaks.
And the birds?
From the beginning, comrade.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Hello, mother.
Don't look at me.
I look awful in the morning.
I'm on a 48-hour pass.
We leave for the border
in a couple of days.
At least you don't hate me
like your sisters.
Still the same obsession!
I knew you'd come.
- Again?
- I dreamt about it.
No, this was something
different.
We were in a garden.
It was summer.
You were three or
four years old.
The air was fragrant.
Someone was singing.
No, it was Mr. Kokinos playing
the violin. Remember him?
Then, I don't know
what happened.
You ran to me.
Hid between my legs.
I held you tight
until you started to sink
inside me
and disappeared.
I got up then.
Mr. Kokinos was still playing
the violin.
But I could feel you inside me.
Good day to you, Tassos.
Welcome, beautiful partridge,
for whom my eyes pined.
Good day to you, Golfo.
Orestes! Orestes!
Orestes!
How are you, father?
I am rotting!
The daisy told me
that you don't love me.
That you no longer adore me.
You cannot melt away
my sadness,
however sweet your caresses...
And then...
I saw another angel
descend from Heaven...
having great power.
And the earth was illumined
with his glory.
And he cried out
in a mighty voice saying:
Babylon! Babylon the great
has fallen!
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow morning...
for the border,
from what they say.
Then we'll soon be
at war here, too.
One night I crossed the river!
There can be no doubt for
any Marxist, that a revolution
is impossible without
revolutionary conditions.
What are the characteristics
of revolutionary conditions?
When a crisis breaks out
in the ruling classes
creating cracks in their policy
through which the discontent
and indignation of the
oppressed classes emerge.
When the misery
and suffering
of the oppressed classes
take a more acute form.
When as a consequence of
the above mentioned conditions
there is a great increase in
the activity of the masses
who in times of peace quietly
allow themselves to be robbed
but in revolutionary times
are forced by circumstances
and the crisis in the ruling
classes
towards independent
historical action.
We must explain to
all governments:
We know you are the armed force
against the proletariat.
We will march against you,
in peace, whenever possible,
with guns when i becomes
unavoidable.
Feasts! Bread! Gallows!
Tell me, girls...
How are you doing?
Where are you going?
Here comes Golfo
and there's Tassos, too.
Come in and see them.
Outside don't wait,
the play is great!
Don't debate,
it's already eight!
Tell me, you guys...
How are you doing?
Where are you going?
Here comes Golfo
and there's Tassos too.
Come in and see them.
The day has come and in the
dawn the morning star has set.
The peaks are drenched in
sunlight and nightingales sing.
Partridges bathe in the streams
but the proudest partridge
of them all,
the beautiful Golfo,
has not appeared.
But here she comes!
Good day to you, Tassos.
Welcome beautiful partridge,
for whom my eyes pined.
They might be watching!
No one can see us save the
birds of the forest
and the surrounding peaks.
And the birds?
What is it?
What's wrong, Golfo?
How can we be together when you
run from the eagle's shadow.
I was terrified.
I thought it was the shadow
of a man.
Don't be afraid.
Only God is here to see us
and surely it is His wish
that we love each other
faithfully and honourably.
Look around you Golfo at
the clouds around us
which like a mist, like a
blanket thrown from heaven
shield us from malicious gossip
and indiscreet eyes.
You are my only thought,
my only dream...
And truly I pray for you
and light a candle
to the Virgin Mary.
You will come back.
No matter how many years go by,
you will come back,
full of remorse,
to ask forgiveness.
One night in shame
you will come back.
When you realize
you were mistaken,
broken-hearted
you will come back.
In the meantime the Turks
occupied Karahissar.
It was August 1922.
The front was breaking up.
Our soldiers arrived,
threw down their arms.
The Greek Army no longer
existed. Disaster had struck.
I managed to board
an Italian ship,
swimming all the way
from Aghia Triada.
Thank God there were
the Italians.
They had designs
on Asia Minor too
but they were more human,
Ioading their ships with
refugees
and bringing them to
Greek soil.
While the French, the Americans
and especially the British
who helped cause the war as
it served their own interests
showed the worst conduct.
I boarded that ship
with nothing on but my pants.
Finally, we arrived
in Keratsini.
I was so hungry.
I longed for spaghetti
cooked in oil.
I kept saying to myself:
I wish I had something to eat!
I jumped into the sea.
The others jumped too.
When I got ashore
I saw an old shepherd.
He gave me an old shirt
to wear.
I set out for Piraeus with
a man from Chios.
We reached a country tavern
where they were cooking beans.
There was a couple inside.
I asked for some water.
"Where are you from?"
they asked.
"We are the first refugees
from Asia Minor," I replied.
"Sit down," said the couple.
"Give them something to eat."
We ate a whole portion
of beans.
They also treated us
to some retsina wine.
It turned out that they
were royalists.
"Don't worry," they said, "one
day we'll get our lands back."
And some nonsense about
the last king of Byzantium.
I said: "I've eaten, I thank
you, goodbye!" And we left.
I was furious.
We spent the night
in a church in Piraeus.
All the refugees
had gathered there.
I slept in a pushcart.
In the morning
I told my companion from Chios:
"We'll go find work."
"Where?" he said.
"Wherever we see a smoke
stack, we'll go."
We finally saw one.
I was barefoot.
I asked the guard
at the factory:
"Excuse me, we are refugees.
Are there any jobs for us?"
"Come in," he said.
They gave us 2 drachmas a day
and a place to sleep.
It was better than nothing!
In the meantime I wondered
what had happened to my family.
I saw an old neighbour.
How are you?
He was the brother of
Vassilis, the actor.
"Your oldest brother was lost,"
he told me.
"Your father, mother and
the kid got off at Mytilene."
I searched heaven and earth
to find them.
But I never did.
Black is the night on
the mountains,
On the cliffs, the snow
is falling.
In the wilderness,
in the darkness...
on the hills, on the rocks,
on the paths...
The Greek draws his sword!
At 5:30 this morning,
28th October, 1940.
the Italian Armed Forces
attacked our frontiers
along the Greek-Albanian
border.
Our forces are defending
the land of our fathers!
Our show tonight
is dedicated...
to this first army communique
and to victory.
The day has come and in the
dawn the morning star has set.
The peaks are drenched in
sunlight and nightingales sing.
Partridges bathe in the streams
but the proudest of them all,
the beautiful Golfo,
has not appeared.
But here she comes.
Good day to you, Tassos.
Welcome, beautiful partridge,
for whom my eyes pined.
They might be watching.
No one can see us save
the birds of the forest
and the surrounding peaks.
And the birds?
What is it?
What's wrong, Golfo?
How can we be together when you
run from the eagle's shadow.
I was terrified.
I thought it was the shadow
of a man.
Don't be afraid.
Only God is here to see us
and surely it is His wish
that we love each other
faithfully and honourably.
The daisy told me that
you don't love me...
that you no longer adore me.
I did it!
At first they didn't want
to take me.
I said: "Take me even
as an auxiliary."
In the end they took me.
Undress.
Are you coming?
Come, my love,
come today,
where everything in life
is fleeting.
Come and place a kiss
on my hair.
If we don't want to see
our streets
smeared once again with the
hammer and sickle.
If we don't want another
Red December...
We must all rally around
the Marshal.
With your vote you'll make
this coming Sunday,
the l6th of November, 1952,
a historic day.
A day of victory
for the national forces.
This is why you must vote
for Papagos.
A vote for the Marshal
is a vote for the only
national candidate.
For the man who led our
army to victory...
against the communist
rebels in 1947-49.
His victory will mean peace,
prosperity, law and order.
Is this where you said the
Englishman was hiding?
You!
I was terrified.
I thought it was the
shadow of a man.
You made me drunk,
you made me mad.
I lost my head.
I don't know what to say.
Oh, God! They'll kill
each other!
You can drop dead. Come what
may he will be mine.
And I'll scratch your eyes out,
you and that witch.
Take this bread
and cheese, child.
I'll go and tend my sheep.
Are you still standing,
you ingrate!
Kneel and ask forgiveness
from that angel!
The play you are about to see
in five acts
is Spyridon Peresiades'
immortal idyll
"Golfo, the Shepherdess",
with a superb cast...
It looks like the Englishman
managed to escape at night.
We have information he was
hiding on stage last night,
disguised as a woman.
His son is with the partisans.
Informer!
Bitch!
I came from beyond the sea,
from lonia. And you?
Fire!
I can feel your daughter
watching us like a dog.
Why don't you send her away?
Anyone who doesn't like it
can leave!
I escaped from prison
with six others.
When the front collapsed, they
handed us over to the Nazis.
The resistance movement
is growing, Electra...
I got a message from Orestes.
I'm leaving for the mountains
to find him.
How many ships have floundered
in your eyes blue as the sea.
Ships whose only purpose
was to dock
in love's harbour.
In your mischievous blue eyes,
my wildest dreams,
my sweetest dreams
were swallowed up,
Iike ships in the darkness
of the night,
hurling against the rocks
of your heart.
Never before in my life
have I ever seen such eyes,
so blue, so large, so bright.
Tell me, you girls...
Where are we going?
What are we eating?
How I love the girls...
a bit of thigh,
a bit of breast...
Don't debate.
Tonight at eight
come to the cafe..
with a wonderful play.
Such lips and eyes.
Such firm young bodies
you'll never hope to find
anywhere.
Everyone outside!
Me, comrade!
It's the partisans!
Turn off the lights!
They're gone!
They're gone!
Now is the time to forge
the public order...
and our democratic liberties!
Countrymen, let us unite
with the national army
and our allies
for the liberation of Greece,
under the leadership
of a government of
National Unity.
GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY
FREEDOM TO THE PEOPLE
And now happy at last,
free from fascism!
We can all go home, brothers,
together, all together,
now that the occupation
is over.
Enslaved people,
tortured people,
the wind of freedom is
blowing. Onward!
And all together let us cry:
Onward, brothers!
THE WIND OF FREEDOM IS
BLOWING. ONWARD!
AND ALL TOGETHER LET US CRY:
ONWARD, BROTHERS!
Partisans, soldiers of
the People's Army!
Break the bonds of slavery!
The bell of freedom is ringing!
Let all the slaves rise up!
THE BELL OF FREEDOM IS RINGING!
LET ALL THE SLAVES RISE UP!
Comrades, let's rise
and take to the streets.
Men and women,
with guns in hand.
Faithful always
to the red flag.
United with the party
which summons you.
Tear down the foundations
of palaces and thrones...
heavy chains, emblems and laws.
Shame to the worker,
shame to the slave
who doesn't drown such
a life in blood.
Till when the foreign boot?
Onward, revolutionaries!
Halt!
Tell me, oh Muse
of the much troubled hero...
No sign of Golfo as yet.
Perhaps some misfortune
has befallen her.
Tassos, my son!
Forgive us, father.
Golfo poisoned herself
and I stabbed myself.
A single grave I beg you dig
and bury us there together,
in each others arms.
My children!
Tassos! Golfo!
Dead!
The world kept them apart.
But here they lie
united in the grave.
Would you believe that
she refused to be my wife?
Me, the nephew of the richest
of shepherds,
grandson of the proudest family
in the region?
Golfo, know that
Kitsos is deadly serious.
If you love another
your fate will be black
and bitter.
Dogs will devour you and
vultures your lover!
My Golfo never insulted anyone.
What are you saying?
You're telling me these lies?
She insulted me to my face
and you're defending her.
I met her on the street,
I said good day and she,
drunk with rage,
hurled insults at me.
I couldn't catch her
for she ran away.
Or else I would have brought
her back to you dead.
Don't pay attention to
what women say!
They have the brain of a bird.
Miserable creatures!
Forget Kitsos.
I, who am his uncle
tell you plainly:
I will never consent
to Kitsos...
marrying Tassos' mistress!
You talk too much, shepherd.
Wait and see!
Take it easy, Master Zissis.
Get lost!
For God's sake!
Leave me alone!
My God, they'll kill
each other!
No!
The daisy told me
that you don't love me,
that you no longer adore me.
You cannot melt away
my sadness,
however sweet your caresses.
In vain, you look into my eyes.
I don't believe you any more,
I tell you!
The daisy told me that
you don't love me
and so I weep in despair.
No! No! No!
Who else was with him?
Where is he now?
In the mountains!
Who else was with him?
In the mountains!
In the mountains!
In the mountains!
After the Germans left
the country,
in the fall of 1944,
in October,
the British, under General
Scobie, entered Athens
and the first government of
National Unity was formed.
There were demonstrations,
enthusiasm.
Because we all believed
in the liberation,
because we had all given
of our best.
We even believed in
alliances and the allies.
So after the disagreement
and Scobie's ultimatum
to have the People's Army
disbanded,
after the resignation of
the communist ministers,
and when we saw the Nazi
collaborators,
free and armed again
by Scobie,
we felt betrayed.
They told us to take part
in the demonstration,
but in fact the people took
to the streets spontaneously.
But the British had planned it.
They wanted an armed
confrontation.
But we didn't know it.
The people took to the
streets carrying flags,
full of emotion, shouting.
The blow on that Sunday in
December, took us by surprise.
Many had brought their
children.
No one expected it.
The masses filled the squares.
It was indescribable!
They were on the roof
of the King George Hotel,
and on the pediments of the
royal palace.
We could see the barrels
of their guns all around us.
We were surrounded by police.
The crowd was shouting.
Suddenly we heard shots!
I was in the middle
of the square.
Someone was hit near the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
The people dipped a flag
in his blood
and raised it high up
and began shouting:
FREEDOM! FREEDOM!
NO MORE OCCUPATION!
And they kept firing at us
from the pediments.
Suddenly, someone else was hit
in the square.
We fell to the ground.
Near me a boy with a bugle.
He was wounded
but he got up and stood
on the sidewalk shouting:
"One more time, I want
to cry out, to blow my bugle!
He fell. They took him away.
I don't remember.
We regrouped and
marched forward.
At the corner further down
there was a group of policemen.
We surrounded and
disarmed them.
But the others kept firing
at us from the roof.
We kept marching.
Britishers and Americans
watched indifferently
from the windows of the
King George hotel.
We reached Omonia Square.
There they fired at us
a second time.
Some were taken to hospital.
Those less badly wounded
we took with us on stretchers
made from doors we wrenched
from nearby houses.
The victims were buried the
next day, December 4th.
We took to the streets again.
On the way back we were
attacked again
by the fascists and the militia
in Omonia Square.
The only thing I remember:
The crowd down on their faces
in the square and the barrels
of the guns protruding from
the hotel across the square.
In two days there were 28 dead
and more than 200 wounded.
That same night the People's
Army responded
with attacks on police
stations. Fighting began.
Barricades.
The battle of Athens lasted
33 days.
"Representatives of
the Greek government
and of the Communist
Liberation Front
after holding a conference
at Varkkiza
in order to examine in common
ways and means
of ending the civil war
and reconciling
the Greek people,
have reached the following
joint agreement.
Upon signing the Protocol
the chairman of the Conference
made the following statement:
On behalf of the government
and the Greek people
I wish to express
our gratitude
to the representatives
of the British empire
and to General Scobie, chief of
the Expeditionary Forces,
who by their presence
and sustained interest
in Greek affairs, have
given us
the firm and unshakeable
conviction that Great Britain
is sincerely concerned with
the future of Greece.
Long live Great Britain!
Article 1
The government will ensure,
according to the constitution
and established democratic
principles,
the free expression
of the political convictions
of the citizens,
abolishing of all pre-existing,
repressive laws.
Article 3
General amnesty is granted to
all political offences
committed between December 3
1944 and the present signing.
Members of the People's
Army
who fail to surrender their
weapons to the authorities
by March 15, 1945
are excluded from this decree
of amnesty.
Article 6
Upon publication of the
present Agreement,
armed resistance groups
and particularly the forces
of the People's Army,
are disbanded.
This procedure and the
surrendering of their arms
will be carried out according
to the special provisions
of the Protocol drafted
by the Technical Committee.
Article 9
Both delegations agree,
to invite the great
allied powers
to send observers in order
to ensure
the expression of the genuine
will of the people.
Athens, February 12, 1945"
THE INN AT GRAVIAS
One of the most famous
and heroic battles
in Greek history, was
the battle of Gravias.
The Turks were on their way
to attack Amfissa.
Then Panourgias and others
occupied the mountain passes
near Gravias.
Androutsos told his men
to follow him to the Inn
and asked who among them wanted
to join him in the dance.
One hundred and eighteen
fighters followed him singing.
Once they got to the Inn he
shut all the doors and cried:
Brave soldiers! Our country is
asking us to do our duty!
What do you want?
Who are you?
What do you want?
People of Greece,
by order of
British Imperialism,
on March 31st,
the most disgraceful parody of
elections will be staged.
The people are being led
to the polls,
under the spectre
of terrorism,
in order to legalise a
monarcho-fascist government
and ensure the return
of the King,
guarantor of British interests
and of foreign and domestic
capitalism.
The Varkiza Agreement
was a farce.
Greeks, the only democratic
stand
is to stay away from the polls!
Say "No" to these rigged
elections!
Long live the People's Army!
HAPPY 1946
For years now we've
been together
and we are a well-matched pair,
and to spite the wicked world
I'll never stop loving you.
I'll keep on loving you
and don't you worry.
And I'll build you a little
nest.
And when the dusk embraces you,
we'll pair off like two birds.
If they tell me to leave you
I would rather the sun
stop shining!
I'm so used to you
and I love you so!
Let them talk and
give me a kiss!
The British cannons
and the new decree
have forced the rebels
to run like hares.
The red bear has fled to
the mountains, oh King.
British cannons don't scare us,
or Scobie's new decree.
We've written these letters
in our blood.
Freedom not Occupation!
We want to and
we'll do it.
We'll bring back the King
who'll bring us our freedom!
Yupie ya ya,
yupie yupie ya...
We don't want the King.
We want the people to rule,
power to the people.
Yupie ya ya,
yupie yupie ya...
The boys of the militia,
hand in hand with the
British and the fascists,
will march on Moscow.
General Scobie's cock
is all tied up in knots.
He goes to a chic square,
to find young boys
waiting there.
General Scobie's cock is
all tied up in knots.
And if the knots come undone,
what will happen to British
policy then, Scobie?
There'll be more knots,
General Scobie.
You might have gathered our
weapons with a thousand tricks,
but you'll never succeed
in bringing back the King.
The people won't stand
for fascism.
They will again raise their
heads against British policy.
Come back, come back to your
ancient nest, our King!
Your people are asking for you.
Come back!
And when you come
you won't find any Reds here.
The nation's guardians
will protect you.
Come back!
Orestes hasn't turned in
his weapons.
His group is still
up in the mountains.
The war isn't over yet!
We shall not shed a drop
of Greek blood,
only the traitorous blood
of rebels and communists,
so that Greece can be saved.
You will have to choose
between two camps.
On the one side an assortment
of suspicious persons
and secret agents
working for Moscow.
On the other a movement
led by an honest fighter,
a heroic soldier,
Marshal Papagos!
When the communists violated
the Varkiza agreement
and tried to seize power for
the second time, our country
was in mortal danger. Two
years of communist rebellion
caused the death of thousands
of people.
It was then that we appealed
to the Marshal.
With the military and moral
backing of the United States
and the support of the king,
he crushed the rebellion
and saved Greece
for the second time.
Those communists who were not
killed
sought refuge behind
the Iron Curtain.
So peace was restored.
The Marshal returned home,
having done his duty.
Today he is asking for
your vote.
Let the 16th of November 1952
be a day of victory
for the national forces,
a victory for the Marshal.
Did you sign?
I was caught towards the end
of 1947.
We were taken to Vourla,
an old brothel turned
into a prison.
All the inmates were
political prisoners.
Then from Vourla to Lavrion
and then to the island
across, Makronissos.
The military prison of Athens
they called it.
Besides the rebels,
there were others...
soldiers, cops, thieves...
Jehovah's witnesses...
They searched us.
They took our watches, our
pens... all we had.
For some the torture began
at once.
The interrogations stopped
when you signed
a declaration against
the Communist Party.
I was to be tortured in the
guardhouse upstairs.
They told me: Listen, you
won't make it out of this place
unless you sign
the declaration.
I refuse to sign, I said,
even if you cut me to pieces.
Two or three hours later they
took me down unharmed.
We didn't beat you, but act
like you're limping
so it will look as if we did.
About 8 o'clock they took me
to the police station.
The sergeant turned me upside
down, like a goat
and beat the daylights
out of me.
When he got tired the others
started beating and kicking.
I fainted twice.
Then they took us outside.
It was winter, February...
There were other prisoners.
They made us stand ten metres
apart from each other.
Someone was standing guard.
In the morning
they beat us again.
Then we were taken to carry
large rocks from the sea.
We would take them up
the hill and down again
for no reason.
One of the tortured prisoners
suffered from tuberculosis.
He went up the hill but his
chest couldn't make it.
When he reached the top he
started spitting blood.
They took him to the hospital.
They would beat us from
5 to 7 or 8 each evening.
And at night they would keep us
spread apart from eath other
so that we couldn't communicate
when they went to sleep.
Our feet were so swollen
they burst our shoes.
I couldn't walk from
the beating.
A guard with a club in his
hand would yell at me:
Run, run! How could I run when
I was dragging myself along.
They tortured me for two weeks.
As each blow fell and
I groaned
the others held
their breath.
Little by little the others
broke down one by one.
There were only 5 or 6 of us
left who would not sign.
The put the pressure on us.
One evening in the twilight
I saw them coming.
Camp guards and torturers
from the other units,
Iike beasts of prey.
We were outside
on the wet ground.
They surrounded us.
This time, I thought, they'll
finish us off for good.
I turned to the guy
next to me.
Things don't look good
tonight, Vassilis.
I couldn't last any longer.
I dragged myself up and told
them I would sign.
The sergeant, delighted, asked
me if I wanted a drink.
I told them I didn't want
anything.
They took me to a tent
and left me.
Two hours later
they brought Vassilis in.
Not dead but crushed.
He hadn't signed!
My little lemon tree,
full of lemons,
woman of Vissani,
I still have not recovered
from your kiss.
My little one,
how you've grown
and here you are ripe for
marriage, woman of Vissani.
Come in!
One night he crossed
the river!
The last time I heard
you say that
was in the summer of '47,
in the resistance.
Three years ago.
How are you?
We heard you got out.
Orestes is in solitary.
They wouldn't let me see him.
Are you better now?
We thought of getting the
company together again,
going back on the road.
We'd like you with us
again, like before.
I'll go over the obstacles.
The intervention of events,
sounds, realignments,
the intervention of navies
from the raging open sea,
the popular speakers,
my breast, the cries...
the factories...
October 1917...
December 1944...
For all this I have chosen
to remain in rags
as the French Revolution
bore me,
as Mother spain bore me,
a dark conspirator!
When sometimes I hear
with my own ears
strange noises and
distant whispers,
when I hear trumpets and songs,
endless speeches, hymns
and noises,
when I hear speak of liberty,
of Biblical laws,
of an ordered life,
I always fall silent.
But someday,
someday, I'll open my mouth.
The gardens will fill
with waterfalls...
The same dirtyards
will become arsenals.
The young, elated, will follow
reciting verses, not hymns,
and never submitting to
the terrifying power.
Once again they promise
a weak freedom!
Come in!
Are you his sister?
We didn't have time
to notify you.
As you know he was condemned
by a military court.
His sentence has been pending
since November 1949.
I'm very sorry.
Good day to you, Tassos.
Let your lovely hair fly
in the mad south wind.
Now that your youth has
blossomed,
Iet your lovely hair down.
I was looking for you.
Aren't you dressed yet?
- Are you nervous?
- No.
Orestes!
In the fall of 1939
we returned to Aegion.
We were tired.
We hadn't slept for two days.
