Joe Blake and Terry Collins...
this is Lieutenant McCormick...
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...
with your hands in the air.
One last big heist.
What a great idea.
Yeah, Joe knows best.
Yes, sirree, Joe knows
exactly what he's doing...
exactly what he's doing.
And what does Joe get me?
Stuck in a bank
called the Alamo...
surrounded by the entire
Los Angeles Police Department.
Look out there.
Remember now, people...
these guys haven't been
prone to violence yet...
in any of these incidents.
So everybody just stay
real calm, all right?
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
have finally met their match.
l think they're running
out of luck very quickly.
They're gonna need
more tricks up their sleeve...
than Siegfried and Roy...
if they think they're gonna get
out of this one.
lf you're just tuning in,
we're in front...
of the Alamo Savings and Loan
right here in Century City.
The place looks like a war zone.
The, uh, the troops are
moving in here.
The SWATteam is moving in.
The helicopters are moving in.
Lao-tzu says that
even the softest of things...
can pass through a horse
like invisible water.
Thank you...
for that completely useless
bit of information, Joe.
You know what
your problem is, huh?
My problem?
Yeah. l'm trapped like a rat!
Destined for an early grave.
Kate Wheeler.
You remember Kate.
Traitor...
liar...
queen of double cross...
empress of deceit.
Hey, duchess, OK,
l get your point, all right?
Oh, do you, Joe?
Do you really?
Because as l recall...
l remember warning you...
in the strongest
language possible...
that taking on
a full-time hostage...
was an error
of epic proportions.
We had no choice, OK?
Yes, we did.
Shoot her and bury her body
in the woods.
That was a choice.
Hey, you brought her in, OK?
l recall that!
You know what?
lf we'd have let her go...
she'd have gone
right to the cops, OK?
Joe, look outside.
She did.
That's exactly what she did.
Kate Wheeler's gonna get...
the thanks
of a grateful nation...
not to mention a sizable reward.
We've got shots fired
in the location.
Good evening, everybody.
l'm Darren Head...
and tonight we have
an incredible story for you.
lt's a story that's part
soap opera, part crime drama...
a story of betrayal and greed.
lt's part Bonnie and Clyde...
it's part Barnum & Bailey.
lt's the story of Joe Blake
and Terry Collins...
the most successful
bank robbers...
in the history
of the United States.
Now, shortly
before the bloody shootout...
that took their lives...
l had the opportunity to
interviewthese men...
in an exclusive interview...
when they broke into my house...
and by gunpoint...
made me tell their story...
from their point of view.
Now, the reason
l bring this up...
is that the footage
you're about to see...
was shot on a home video camera
by my personal assistant Julio.
So it's a little shaky
and a little wobbly...
not exactly professional.
Now, what happened in
the wide-ranging exchange is...
Blake and Collins revealed to me
for the first time anywhere...
the inside story...
of the daring robberies
that made them so famous.
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead...
and we have an exclusive--
OK. Again.
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead.
So tonight
on a very special edition...
of ''Criminals at Large''...
the inside story,
the true story...
of the Sleepover Bandits.
And...fade to black.
That was great, guys.
We're gonna keep that one.
-All right.
-Cut it.
We'll use that
with the ''B'' roll.
Got it. Roll!
Don't quit on me, brother.
lt's ridiculous.
lf it's not one thing,
it's another.
lf it's not downright apathy,
it's just meanness.
Total meanness.
Can't get any support
from anybody.
Nobody else has to
eat this crap like l do.
You got to jab to spar, man.
Hey, Joe.
Joe...
may l have a word
with you, please?
Hey, Joe.
lt's a violation
of my civil rights.
That's what it is.
Cruel and unusual punishment...
expressly forbidden
by the Constitution, you hear?
Prison is supposed to be
cruel and unusual, Terry.
That's the whole idea.
That's not what
l'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
Garlic.
Warden Currier has banned
the sale...
of fresh garlic
in the commissary...
because he doesn't
like the smell.
You see, Joe...
it's like a--
it's a miracle drug.
High blood pressure
and arthritis...
and cancer...
emphysema...
allergies, anything.
Garlic is the first line
of defense, always.
Hold on one second, Mario.
You see what l'm saying?
And l've got symptoms.
l don't care what
that doctor says.
Maybe now's not a good time
to talk about garlic?
Hey, Joe.
You--you know,
don't worry about it.
Once you come down
out of the ring...
don't do what l think
you're gonna do, please.
You remember what l told you,
right, Joe?
Don't--don't--
uh, don't do the, uh--
You really chipped
my tooth, Mario.
Joe, for God's sake.
Joe.
Joe, wait.
Joe, hey.
Joe, anger management.
Anger mana--Joe!
Anger management!
Joe.
Calm down.
Breathe.
You ever read the ''Tao''?
l'm sorry?
You know, the guy, uh, Lao...
Lay, uh, Lo-wi...Lu...
-Lao-tzu.
-There you go. Lao-tzu.
You know, Joe, l begged you
to stay out of the library.
You begged me to work
on my anger management.
Yeah, well,
medication's quicker.
lt's much more effective.
You know what?
l would like to sleep
in a comfortable bed tonight.
l'd like to have me
a cheeseburger...
french fries...
a big old chocolate milk shake
for dinner.
Ancient Chinese wisdom?
No. Just hungry.
Hold up.
l definitely chipped my tooth.
For the love of God...
does no one else hear
that infernal ringing?
Oh, yeah, sure,
go ahead and laugh...
but according
to the latest research...
tinnitus, which is what
they call it--
that's what l've got
in my ear--
l don't make this shit up--
is an actual disease.
Go ahead and laugh...
play basketball, have fun.
ln the meantime...
l've got goddamn Quasimodo
going off in my head--
bell tower, you understand me?
l got a bell tower in my head!
Hey, you the driver
of this thing?
Yeah.
Pretty easy to drive, is it?
Pretty easy. Uh-huh.
Joe?
Oh, my God.
Joe, what are you doing
in a cement truck?
Joe?
Joe, what am l doing?
Why are we
in the concrete thing...
getting shot at?
Just keep your head down!
Joe!
Take it down!
Joe. Jesus.
There's, like, a truck!
Joe, Joe!
How long you been planning this?
Just sort of came up.
Hang on to something.
Deer!
Plastic.
Don't you think we should be
looking for a road?
Joe.
Stop. Stop, please.
-Ma'am.
-Uh-huh?
We're gonna need
to borrow your car.
-You are?
-Yes.
Would you just unhook
your seat belt, please?
Come on. Here you go.
Very nice.
Thank you.
That's a really lovely dress.
Thank you.
-Come on.
-Thank you.
Get in the car.
OK.
-Ma'am.
-Yes?
Don't forget your purse.
Thank you.
OK, first things first.
We need, uh--what do we need?
We need clothes.
We're gonna need money.
A place to hide.
We better get
a new car pretty quick.
l don't feel good about driving
down Main Street...
wearing clothes that say inmate,
you know what l mean?
Hey, why are we stopping here?
This is where they
keep the cash.
Hey! Stupid!
What cash?
Didn't you say something
about needing money?
Well, yeah, but, l mean,
not right now.
Look, Joe, let's just
discuss this for a minute, OK?
l mean, l knowthat money's
on the list...
but it's not at the top
of the list.
-Bingo!
-Bingo what?
What do you mean, bingo?
Are you gonna knock over a bank
with a magic marker?
l mean, what are you
gonna do, write on them?
We don't even have a plan.
You have to have
some kind of plan...
to rob a bank.
We're wearing matching
denim uniforms...
that say inmate on them.
Unless these people are blind...
l don't think this is
gonna work, you understand?
Don't move.
Take out your gun...
thumb and middle finger
on the butt.
Hand it to me slowly.
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be out of your way...
in just a second.
No phone calls,
no alarms, please.
Cash drawers open.
Take a bag, fill it with cash.
Cash, please.
Ma'am, is there any other cash
in the back?
-No.
-Don't touch that phone, sir.
-Are you sure?
-l'm positive.
Don't touch that.
Are you telling me the truth?
l'm telling you the truth.
You look very honest.
Quickly, please. Thank you.
He made no plan
whatsoever for this.
Here we go.
Put that right in there.
We'll take that. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
l'll take that. Here we go.
OK. Thank you very much.
Oh, there's just never
enough time when you're working.
Thank you for your cooperation.
No phone calls, no alarms.
Here we go. Come on.
Take that.
Take this.
Sir, in case you need
to highlight anything.
Here we go. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop.
Hey, hey. Whoa, ho, ho, ho!
What?
Sir, we need to borrow your car.
Find a bus, asshole.
Hey, come over here. This car.
You got the gun?
No.
Come back here, goddamn it.
Hold it!
Come on. Sit up and act regular.
Hold it right there.
Chest pain...
left arm a little numb...
accelerated heartbeat, spots.
l'm actually seeing spots.
Hang on.
l'm feeling nauseous.
Out!
Are you all right?
May l please go back to prison?
Not yet.
Oh, shit!
What's your name?
Cheri.
Zip up your pants, Cheri.
You, too.
l'm Phil.
So where's your mom, Cheri?
My mom doesn't
live here anymore.
And your dad?
Oh, he's fishing
for the weekend.
So your dad left you here
all alone.
Oh, no. He thinks l'm
at a friend's house.
And how about you, Scooter?
Oh, l told my folks
l had a soccer trip.
You lied to your parents?
Oh, you're kidding, right?
No, l'm not kidding.
l'm sorry...
who are you guys?
Hey, you're inmates.
What did you say your name was?
Uh, Phil.
You think there's
something funny...
about being an inmate, Phil?
We're bank robbers, OK?
So what's on our mind?
Parizo Del Mar.
Parizo?
Paradise.
My uncle owns this little hotel
on the water...
about 100 miles south
of Acapulco.
That's Mexico.
Right. That's where they keep
Acapulco, Terry.
But l have
sanitation issues, Joe.
We'll buy the hotel...
turn it
into a nightclub and resort.
l could wear a tuxedo...
sell margaritas
to the tourists.
We could have some fun.
You'd do that?
l mean, you and me?
Yeah.
Partners?
Partners.
Tuxedos and margaritas?
-Good, right?
-Yeah.
l can run the kitchen.
You can work the room.
lt's a high-risk business,
but, l mean...
considering the alternatives...
l got to say l think
that sounds really good.
l just have one question.
How do we pay for it?
Well...
we are bank robbers.
So where is it?
Below my belt
and above my knees.
You know what l mean.
You are gonna get us killed.
Maybe l'll save the day...
and we'll both be rich
and famous and on TV.
l think there's a way
to do it right.
l'm sure of it.
So, where is it?
ln Daddy's closet,
behind the golf clubs.
All right. l'm going.
What's the biggest problem
every time you rob a bank?
Getting caught?
Exactly.
There's guards to shoot at you.
There's tellers to hit alarms.
There's customers to get
in the way, right?
Right.
You need to control
the environment--
no guards, no tellers,
no customers.
Yeah, but if you
work at night...
you still got to deal
with the alarms.
But we don't work at night.
When do you do it?
Holidays?
No.
We do it
with the bank manager...
in the morning,
with the bank manager's keys...
and the bank manager's
vault codes...
because we kidnap him
the night before.
l mean, think about it.
We pick a town.
We pick a bank.
We find out who's in charge.
We pay him a little visit.
We spend the night with him,
like we are here.
The next morning,
we all go to work together...
before anybody else gets there.
And we take the money and run.
Tuxedos and margaritas, Joe,
just like you said.
Life will be like
one big sunset.
Want to see something neat?
Aim the shotgun at me.
What?
Aim it at me.
Freeze?
Pretty good.
But first you got to pump
a shell into the chamber...
like this.
Neat.
The conversation is over,
all right?
Well, l feel good
in this collar--
l've always liked this
kind of collar--
but you boned me
on the pants, Joe.
lt's really not fair.
lt's a low blow.
l picked those pants out for me.
l laid them out.
l specifically chose those.
Well, well,
look at you gentlemen.
Are the clothes all right?
Aren't we looking
a bit spiffy in plaid?
Oh, he likes plaid.
Two sugars, right?
Thank you very much.
Cheri, we're gonna
have to borrow Phil's car.
That's OK.
He doesn't mind.
The hell l don't.
That's a newtransmission.
So where are we headed?
Rufus.
Where's Rufus?
lt's up the road
a little ways.
What's at Rufus?
Pollard...
Harvey Pollard.
What?
Oh, you feel the need to shoot?
Well, go ahead and shoot, then.
What, you feel
the need to shoot?
Well, go ahead and shoot, then.
Oh, to hell with it.
Feel the need--
Draw!
Dog!
Joe!
Joe?
Joe.
What's up? l thought
you were still in--
No, got out early.
Terry...
say hello to my cousin
Harvey Pollard.
Glad to know you.
Any friend of Joe's, man...
Was it Harry?
Terry.
Those are wicked pants.
So, what are you doing?
Working?
Special effects--
well, stunt work, primarily.
Mostly training right now.
Damn squibs won't fire.
We're looking for somebody
who can handle a car.
l can do that. Why?
Banks.
You're fooling with me.
Well, hell, Joe, l'm just
the man you're looking for.
You want a beer?
Yeah, l'll take a beer.
Timer malfunction.
Draw!
l'm gonna get a beer.
He's honest...
and he falls real good.
Me, l'm gonna make a name
for myself in fire.
l've been practicing with gels--
you know, mostly on my hands...
but l need a suit.
Harvey, speaking of the job--
You ever wonder why a man
would set himself on fire...
and jump off the top
of a twelve-story building?
Gosh, no, l didn't, Harv.
Women love a man
who loves danger.
You guys were talking about
before--about the frontman.
You kept mentioning this guy.
Will you explain to the people
at home--and to me--
what exactly the frontman does
and who he is?
Well, Darren...
the frontman handles pretty much
everything else...
except robbing the bank.
He rents the rooms.
He gets the supplies, the food
that, you know, we would eat.
He drives the getaway car.
Joe and l maintain
what you call a low profile.
Right.
lf the frontman
is never seen in a bank...
we're never seen out of one.
l plotted all the banks
that we would rob...
from Oregon to California.
Our first bank on the list
was the Oregon City Bank.
So the schedules
and the routines...
and the bank guards,
the tellers, everything--
we got it all down...
but mostly we watched
our first hostage...
Darill Miller,
the bank president...
who didn't know it yet...
but he was about
to spend the night...
with the Sleepover Bandits.
That sounded good, right?
Yeah, it's pretty--
''Didn't know it yet, but he was
about to spend the night...
''with the Sleepover Bandits.''
lt's very newsworthy.
Look. lt's his job, all right?
l asked him to get me
a good mustache...
and he gives me something
that looks like...
it come out of
a Cracker Jack box.
This is not about the mustache.
We're going to work.
He got you a nice wig.
Look at you.
You look great.
Have you noticed the burns?
They're kind of flapping.
Hon, can you get the door?
Everybody, dinner
in a half-hour!
Howdy.
We're here to rob
your goddamn bank.
Now just get in there.
lt's OK, Mommy.
The important thing here--
The important thing
to remember--
The important thing...
is that we spend
a quiet night together...
and then tomorrow morning,
bright and early...
we all go down to the bank
together and--
it's really a reasonable
proposition...
if you think about it.
Sure.
Whatever you say.
That's the spirit.
Stop playing
with your food, Erika.
But it's too long.
Here.
Next time l want you to try
to wrap it around your fork...
just like Daddy does.
Cut mine, Mom.
Just a second, hon.
The sauce is too red.
lt's not too red.
Yes, it is.
The sauce is too red.
You know, actually,
Mrs. Miller...
this sauce is quite terrific.
-lt's delicious.
-lsn't it?
l hate it.
Thank you.
What time's the vault set for?
7:30.
Tomato lemon?
Lemon zest, oregano,
a little cream--
see, l cook a little.
Keys?
Two.
l have one.
The operations officer
has the other one.
There's something in here
l can't identify, though.
ls it basil?
Rosemary?
No, don't tell me.
lt's not that big of a deal.
lt's saffron.
Yes, it's saffron.
Bingo. l knew it.
You know, sometimes l put
a little sugar in mine.
lt cuts the acidity.
Sugar.
Thank you. l'll...
try to remember that.
Little tricks, you know.
Want to see something
cool that l can do?
Sure.
Monica.
What?
We've got guests...sort of.
You really think you're gonna
fool anybody in that getup?
l mean, you look like
Neil Young from that--
what was that album?
''After the Horses'' or...
lt was ''After the Gold Rush,''
and that's not the one.
lt's the one
where he's leaning...
against a tree in the snow
or whatever.
That's what l was
actually going for.
Getting out of the bank
is almost as important...
as getting into it.
The hostages were kept under
the strictest possible guard...
to prevent escape
or alarm of any type, you see?
See, we had to bring
their kids along...
the Miller children.
Butane?
Copy. This is Butane.
You're all clear and ready
to rock and roll.
Please turn your music down.
l can't hear a word you said.
You're ready to rock and roll!
Thank you.
OK, girls.
You just stay right here.
Everybody should be here
in ten minutes.
What's the all clear?
What's that?
Washington...on the inside.
What?
George Washington.
When it's all clear,
he's facing in.
Make it all clear, Darill.
Cool.
Three more.
Good morning.
Good morning, Darill.
Good morning.
Good morning, ladies.
ls this a joke?
No, ma'am.
This is a bank robbery.
Hurry it up.
lt's not a parade. Come on.
All righty, then.
Just have a seat
with everybody else.
lt's not gonna take long.
Monica?
l have to go to the bathroom.
No more juice boxes, Cloe, OK?
lf it weren't for the fact
that the kids had bladders...
the size of hummingbirds...
it would have been done...
Well, they drank a lot of juice.
One of these days,
you're gonna get caught.
lt's a very dangerous job.
Aren't you ever
scared and afraid?
When you know danger
the way we do--
l know it like an animal,
like a wild animal.
You know what they
call me in jail?
No, l don't.
The panther.
Ladies and gentlemen...
thank you very much
for your cooperation.
Please make no
attempt to escape...
because we will be monitoring
the police scanners...
and we'll kill you if you do.
When you're
a well-oiled machine...
you exude danger.
Sure.
People fear you.
They fear your presence.
The gun, really, is secondary.
Thank you.
Now listen.
We go our separate ways.
Two weeks from today, we meet--
-Klamath Falls.
-Klamath Falls, right.
You take this map.
lt's on there.
l want to go with Joe.
You can't do that.
You can't.
They're looking for two men...
and that's why
we're splitting up...
and going solo as planned.
What am l supposed
to do for two weeks?
You stay out of trouble.
Try that.
What about the minivan?
You leave it here.
l like the minivan.
lt's roomy.
l appreciate that,
but as it's a stolen minivan...
it's probably better
that you leave it here.
Let's go. We got to go.
Come on.
Well, what about my money?
There's yours right there.
We split it three ways,
nothing fancy.
l'm gonna buy me a fire suit,
first thing.
l bet l can mail-order
one out of L.A.
Way to go.
Good job, man.
You, too, buddy.
We did it.
Be careful.
Stay out of trouble.
What are you gonna buy
with your shares?
Paradise.
Two weeks.
Klamath Falls.
Be careful!
Joe Blake and Terry Collins...
this is Lieutenant McCormick...
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...
with your hands in the air.
This could be a bad time...
but l just want to point out
that l did warn you that...
that woman was gonna be
the ruin of us.
Right. Understood.
But as our future looks
rather bleak and miserable...
l suggest we figure out
what got us here...
in the first place...
which brings us
back to that woman.
The most common symptom
of vaginitis...
is an abnormal
vaginal discharge, often...
...probably from an allergic
reaction to mites.
Out of gas.
Shit.
What is that smell?
lt's a gratin
with Florence fennel...
new potatoes...
clam and sorrel soup
with cream and mirepoix...
and stuffed quail.
Kate, l have a dinner tonight--
clients.
Tonight?
Oh, well, it's just for fun.
l'm going to the gym.
See you.
Sweetheart?
Yeah?
Why don't you go see a movie?
We're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks
l really need you tonight
Once upon a time,
l was falling in love
Stop!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Are you OK?
Come on.
l'm so sorry.
Come on.
Hospital, hospital.
Cascade Memorial Hospital
is located at...
Can you wiggle your toes?
Voices.
22nd Avenue...
Hearing voices.
Where are the voices?
Are they--
Are those in my--
Hey, wait.
Uh, hey. You pull--
You pull--
You pull over and--
You pull over
and get out of the car.
You don't have to get
all huffy about it.
You need to pull the car over.
lt was an accident.
Listen.
l'll shoot you with this thing.
Oh, go ahead.
lt'll be an improvement,
believe me.
Will you listen to me, miss?
-Kate.
-Kate.
l'm a desperate man.
-Desperate?
-Yes.
You don't know
the meaning of the word.
Desperate is when
you wake up in the morning...
and you wish you hadn't.
lt's knowing that every time you
get behind the wheel of a car...
you're only a tree away
from ending the empty charade...
that your life has become.
So don't talk to me
about desperate.
Listen. On second thought,
why don't you just pull over...
and let me out right here?
Thank you for the lift,
but l'll be fine.
-No. No!
-l'll walk from here. Why?
l'm feeling very fragile
at the moment.
l don't think l should be alone.
You're insane!
l'm unhappy.
lt's not the same thing.
Hey. l'm a fugitive
from justice.
l'm a dangerous criminal.
Oh, well,
that explains the hijacking.
You hit me.
You can't expect to step in
front of a moving automobile...
and make it stop.
Yes, you can.
l've seen it done.
Would you not yell at me?
Well, can you slow down
or something?
l want to get out of here.
l'll jump.
That's what l'm gonna do.
How do you unlock this door?
Push a button.
Let--Let--
Unlock this door.
So where you headed?
l'll drop you.
l mean, you're
in no shape to drive.
So you're a fugitive, huh?
What did you do wrong?
Everything.
Alert. Your global positioning
system is rerouting.
Where is that coming from?
What is that?
Between the second set of trees.
The second set of trees,
right here.
Look at me! l'm on fire!
Just don't ask.
Lookee! Yeah!
What the hell is this?
Kate, Paul Bunyan. Paul, Kate.
Kate?
l ran out of gas.
And?
And she hit me with her car.
OK. She hit you with her car.
What the hell did you bring her
out here for?
Well, one, l had no choice.
Two, l may have suffered
a slight concussion.
And three,
she's mentally unbalanced...
to a spectacular degree.
l can hear you.
l tried to escape.
She wouldn't stop.
l almost jumped
from a speeding car, Joe.
Do you hear me?
l had double vision.
What was l gonna do?
Your left eye's a fraction
darker than your right one.
Nobody ever noticed.
l'm Joe.
l'm Kate.
Oh, what happened to your tooth?
All right. OK.
Why don't you just
get on your way, OK?
Act like you never met us.
Send us a postcard
from Crazy Town.
Can l stay here?
Just that l don't know
where else to go.
lt'll only be one night.
Please?
l'm not sure we can do that.
Absolutely no way. There's--
That's not possible.
l can't go home.
l can't.
l could go to the police.
l mean, what's to stop me
leading them...
straight to your hideout?
What are you
hiding from, anyway?
l mean, he wouldn't tell me.
He's very, very discreet.
Come here, Joe. Come here.
What are you--
What's with the pulling?
-l want to talk with you.
-What's that?
Jeez, this is
a very, very bad idea.
ln the history of bad ideas,
this is a humdinger, OK?
No. She's right
about the police.
Shoot her.
Bury her body in the woods.
What am l, invisible?
She said she doesn't have
anyplace to stay.
lt's none of our business.
lt is nowthat you
brought her here, isn't it?
Well, l needed a ride, OK?
l mean, there l was,
sprawled out on the asphalt, OK?
You knowthe hardest thing
about being smart?
No.
l always pretty much know
what's gonna happen next.
There's no suspense.
And don't think l didn't see...
the look in your eye
over there...
and feeling her little hair
and all that kind of stuff.
l'm implementing a 24-hour rule
from now on, OK?
lt's in effect.
Twenty-four hours.
Twenty-four hours and not
a minute longer, missy.
Thank you.
''Missy.''
Hey. l'll cook dinner.
l cook the dinners around here.
Sorry. Not familiar
with the outlaw code.
Does that mean l'm a hostage?
Well, l was in Las Vegas.
Don't get excited.
l'm not talking to you.
Well, Joe, you know the costs.
Hotel remodeling, real estate.
l've estimated $20,000
for the kitchen alone.
l mean, we're talking
about restaurant quality here...
and that's not to mention
the nightclub.
You know, l got a crippled
cousin up in New Hampshire...
that's going in for her seventh
operation on her leg, OK?
l got my mother's people
up in Ottawa...
the aunts and the uncles.
These bills add up, Terry, OK?
l'm duly impressed by any and
all charitable contributions.
How crippled?
Did you know you could bet
on lrish hurling?
Hey, hey, hey.
Excuse me, Harvey.
l'm trying to figure out
why my partner here...
when he wasn't
helping improve...
the Blake family
standard of living...
managed to spend $200,000.
l met a very lovely young
lady from the Netherlands...
down in San Diego...
Oh, color me surprised.
who took me
to this Oktoberfest deal...
and they had a big parade...
and she wanted to ride
on one of the floats, OK?
So l bought her one.
Now, we're drinking these
big steins of Holland beer...
and one thing leads to another,
and l'm throwing 50-dollar bills
out to the crowd.
The thing about lrish hurling...
is that it's like
football with sticks.
Stop it.
Stop it, please,
for God's sake, Pollard, OK?
OK.
You meet a girl.
You go to a festival.
-October festival.
-Oktoberfest.
You throw 50-dollar bills
to the crowd.
l notice you got
a new gold watch.
This is an 18-karat
gold watch.
l don't give a shit
how many karats it is.
Thirty-six grand.
lt's no big deal.
Did you ever think about
asking somebody for the time?
lt's a lot cheaper.
Anything else?
Well, yeah.
We stayed a couple days longer
than l thought we were gonna...
down in San Diego...
and l had to get her
back to the Netherlands...
so l chartered a private jet
to take her home.
Oh, of course you did.
-The Netherlands.
-Yeah.
Joe.
What?
Listen.
Let me try to explain
something to you.
Paradise doesn't
come cheaply, OK?
Now, l've figured this
down to the last nickel.
Now, and here's
the important part...
every nickel that we spend...
is a nickel
that we have to steal.
Now, that's a lot
of nickels, Joe.
l don't want to rob banks
for the rest of my life.
The stress level
is just too damned high.
Harvey?
Joe?
Dinner's almost ready.
Now, this is not bad.
lt's a little--
lt's a little chewy, but--
You boys ever eat and talk
at the same time?
We used to.
So, what sort of work
do you do, crimewise?
Bank robbery.
Well, they rob banks.
l drive the getaway car.
Harvey.
That's enough, Harvey.
Wait a minute.
You're not the--
the guys who go to
the bank manager's house...
you know,
the night before, and you--
They do.
l drive the getaway car.
Harvey!
For the love of God.
You're the Sleepover Bandits.
Oh, my God,
you're practically famous.
The Sleepover Bandits?
That's us?
Don't you watch
''Criminals at Large''?
You should.
They're watching you.
You're astounding, Harvey.
So...
you rob banks.
Well, that's impressive.
What, some little old ladies'
savings accounts...
and Cub Scout dues and homeless
orphan Christmas funds?
ls that what--
We never stole a penny from
anybody who earned it, lady.
That money's federally insured
by the government.
The government
steals money from people...
and we just take it
back from them.
Any more questions, Kate?
Got a spare toothbrush?
Didn't have time to pack.
God, nobody could be that sick.
Put that down.
May l?
What are you doing here?
Cleaning my teeth.
l mean, manic depression...
delusion, l understand
all of that.
lt's very impressive, but--
Do you know how many germs
are on your finger?
That kind of
defeats the purpose.
Well, if you don't
give me a toothbrush...
l don't have much option, do l?
l don't think you're crazy
at all, you knowthat?
l think you're bored.
l think you're bored
with your life...
and you're expecting
that some miracle's...
gonna drop out of the sky...
and suddenly make
everything better...
or at least hopeful because
you lost hope a long time ago...
and your marriage sucks.
But l'm sorry, Kate.
We can't help you.
You don't know me.
You only think you do.
You're joking.
Saw it in a movie.
How does it end?
With a wedding.
Beavers and ducks!
Suckers.
l'm not waiting for anything
to fall out of the sky.
l'm not bored. l'm angry.
Maybe he's right
about running out of hope.
lt's not entirely my fault.
lt's just that l picked
the wrong life.
The valley spirit is a woman.
Use her root
at the gateway of heaven...
and it will never fail.
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?
Not a clue.
l'm hoping that it means...
figure out what you want
and just take it.
Oh, please.
What, like robbing a bank?
Like that. Yeah.
lf only life were that simple.
Like a shadow on me
all of the time
l don't know what to do.
l'm always in the dark.
We're living in a powder keg,
giving off sparks.
Once upon a time,
l was falling in love.
Now l'm only falling apart.
Nothing l can do.
Total eclipse of the heart.
Once upon a time,
there was light in my life.
Nowthere's only
love in the dark.
Nothing l can do.
Total eclipse of the heart.
Oh, my God.
Give me a break.
Turn around, bright eyes.
l can't believe
you knowthat song.
Yeah. Bonnie Tyler.
''Total Eclipse of the Heart.''
lt's the ultimate
sappy chick song.
-lt's not a sappy chick song.
-lt's very sappy.
No, it's not.
Oh, please don't argue.
l'm having a really hard day.
This is the song
that all girls sing--
lt is an epic haiku to the--
A what?
lt's a haiku
to the complexity of love.
lt's also pretty
embarrassing for guys.
When that song was out, l used
to listen to it on the radio.
l have to admit,
l would get a little misty.
Really?
Yeah, a little...
and l would appreciate it if you
didn't mention that to anyone.
l won't tell a soul.
Thanks.
That's all right. l'll get it.
Oh, l'll get it.
No, no. Why don't you just
stay under the covers there?
You know what other song
jacked me up when l was a kid?
That song about the pony,
''Wildfire.''
You know that song?
Oh, l love that pony song.
-You do?
-l love all pony songs.
-Really? You know--
-Yeah.
lt's the one that goes...
Ride, pony, ride
That's ''Mustang Sally.''
Close. lt's a horse.
Wasn't the pony called Sally?
No. This pony
was called Wildfire.
He busted down the stall.
Busted down his stall
You don't remember that?
And they called him ''Wildfire.''
Joe?
Yeah.
l think l know what l want.
Amazing.
Joe, the 24-hour rule...
is all that stands
between us and chaos.
Are you listening to me?
We're at kind of
a crossroads here...
and l want you to be very clear
about my meaning.
l'm changing
the 24-hour rule, OK?
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
She's a missing person.
Missing, meaning that someone's
looking for her.
You get it?
l'm changing the 24-hour rule.
May l help you?
Oh, l'm sorry.
We're here to rob your bank.
What the hell is that?
lt's a disorder
that affects your ability...
to regulate
sleep and wakefulness.
l thought he was dead.
No. That's cataplexy,
a secondary symptom...
sudden loss
of voluntary muscle control.
l just have one question.
Why now?
ln Lare's case, emotional stress
is the primary ignitor.
Do you have a guest bedroom
here, ma'am?
Now we're just gonna ask you
to step right over here...
in the manager's office.
Go ahead.
You never know what's gonna
happen during a robbery.
-That's the thing.
-Sure, sure.
There's always a surprise
of some kind...
l mean, you know,
beyond your control...
but, l mean, the thing is that
you have to remain calm...
-under pressure...
-That's right.
and think on your feet.
No, no.
All l'm saying is it just seems
a little silly...
falling asleep
during a bank robbery.
Well, it may appear
silly to you...
but there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.
Done.
l'm sorry. l'm a little nervous.
lt's OK, Larry.
There's nothing
to be nervous about.
You see, my body chemistry
is extraordinarily sensitive...
to suggestion.
Any symptom can be manufactured,
given the right circumstances...
and that, by the way,
doesn't mean that it isn't real.
Jesus, this stuff is hot.
Go get Mrs. Fife.
So l met this girl...
and, you know, l wanted
to impress her, so l said...
''You want to see me
light my hands on fire?''
You know, because
l bet she'd never seen...
anything like that before...
and she said,
''Well, what about your head?''
-l said, ''Look--''
-Your head?
Yeah, my head.
Like, l don't have
the proper gear...
for that kind of stunt,
at least not yet.
l said, ''No way,'' but she
wouldn't listen, you know?
Flaming hands wasn't enough.
She wanted to see me
set my head on fire.
So what did you do?
Singed off half my hair.
Little bit more, sweetheart.
Here you go.
-ls he coming around?
-Yes.
Because--because we really
need him to come around.
He's coming around.
Do you understand?
We don't have much time.
This is ridiculous.
lt's the emotion thing.
Nervous breakdown here.
Guys, we have a problem.
We got multiple bogies
at nine o'clock.
What the hell is that?
lt's the drive-up window.
Someone's at the drive-up.
At 8:00 in the morning?
-What do we do?
-Nothing.
Hello?
l'm telling you,
you act too eager like that...
and Dottie's never gonna
give you a second look.
Women do not respond to need.
lt's the police.
Good morning.
Where's Dottie?
Who?
The drive-up girl.
Oh, l'm sorry.
Dottie. Of course.
Uh, she's sick.
Sick with what?
Vaginitis.
She's been suffering from
an abnormal vaginal discharge.
lt's a common symptom...
a viscous fluid usually
associated with, uh...
well, vaginitis.
This usually
is associated with--
All clear, Bubba.
You all right?
That was great.
lt's exciting, right?
Yeah.
Why a college parking lot?
Always lots of cars around...
even in the morning.
Leave the Jaguar here.
No gambling.
l'll see you in Tonopah
in two weeks, you understand?
-Yeah. All right.
-Two weeks.
You hear me?
He'll get tired of her.
lt just takes time. You'll see.
l don't know.
Kate's a special lady.
Kate is an iceberg
waiting for the Titanic.
Has anybody seen Kate Wheeler?
Local authorities...
are investigating
the possible connection...
between the missing woman...
and the latest in a series
of bank robberies...
committed by
the Sleepover Bandits.
Wheeler vanished just 24 hours
before the robbery...
of the San Andreas Bank.
Her abandoned automobile was
discovered a short distance...
from the automobile belonging
to bank manager Lawrence Fife.
But a much bigger question
remains unanswered, people.
Who exactly
are these mystery men?
ln a related development...
a federal task force
has been assembled...
to try to piece together
this whole mystery.
ls there a connection
between the missing woman...
and the Sleepover Bandits?
ls Kate Wheeler associated
with the Sleepover Bandits...
or is she part of the gang?
We'll keep you updated...
right here as this whole story
unfolds on ''Criminals at Large.''
Harvey?
Yeah?
Do you remember what l said
about conspicuous behavior?
Keeping a low profile.
Are you achieving it,
do you think?
You bet.
Good boy.
What do you think of my boots?
Very lifelike.
Hey!
Nineteen.
We'll be right there,
and just so you know...
l got a bee up my ass
about you two.
Congratulations, Kate.
You're a famous missing person,
practically a TV star.
Different for you, bad for us.
You see, we pretty much
try to keep ourselves...
out of the spotlight
whenever possible.
Nobody saw me.
We barely left the room.
Go home!
-No.
-Yes!
Joe.
lt's up to Kate.
What do you mean,
it's up to Kate?
Relax, Terry Lee.
We went shopping.
Bought me my first disguise.
You went shopping?
Yeah, we went shopping.
What's the big deal?
Man.
We have a wig.
We have a hat for those long,
sunny days on the lam.
What do you think?
l don't care about it.
l've told you.
Hey, what happened to Kate?
You made a joke.
Oh, that's cute.
They made a little love joke.
So, Joe, is she worth it?
l mean, in theory...
isn't one woman
just like the next?
So l was just wondering,
you know?
l mean, is she worth it?
She's got saliva
in her mouth.
Well, of course she's got
saliva in her mouth.
Everybody does.
lt's glandular.
She's got more.
Really? How much?
A lot.
A lot? Well, that sounds like...
some sort of tumor
in the parotid gland.
You know, rabies is transferred
that way--by saliva.
Terry...
no one has ever
kissed me like that before.
Ever.
Law enforcement officials
have finally discovered...
the identities
of the Sleepover Bandits.
Joe Blake
and Terry Collins escaped...
from an Oregon
State Penitentiary...
just three months ago.
Today for the first
time ever...
Blake and Collins were
added to both the FBl...
and the Federal Marshal's
top ten most wanted list.
And not only that, but
a half-million-dollar reward...
was offered for their capture.
The identities of these
modern-day Robin Hoods...
were first confirmed
by two teenage hostages...
who were taken after
the amazing prison break.
Darren, here they are.
Cheri Woods, wait.
Cheri Woods?
-Please get back.
-Are you hurt?
What was it like?
Did they tie you up?
No, they were really nice.
We ordered pizza
and played video games.
-Please back up.
-We need to talk to you.
Did they take anything?
Yeah, they took my car.
They didn't do anything.
They were very nice.
Please move back.
Ladies and gentlemen...
thank you so much
for your cooperation.
Please make no attempt
to escape...
as we will be monitoring
the police scanner...
and we'll kill you if you do.
Thanks again
for your cooperation.
Bye, Joe. Bye, Terry.
That's great.
''Bye, Joe. Bye, Terry.''
Did you hear that?
Harvey?
Harvey?
Harvey, aren't we supposed
to be following the guys...
to the rendezvous?
Pink.
-The girl?
-Pink boots.
Number one lesson on howto
get a girl--play hard to get.
Let's go, sweetheart.
You think she needs a ride?
-No.
-l think she needs a ride.
l think l need a ride.
Let's go.
Accelerate and go.
Go.
ls this the only road?
Don't worry. We'll find them.
You just rest your
little head, young lady.
There they are.
lt's OK.
We got them.
All righty!
We thought we'd lost you.
Go!
You are so cute.
You are really cute.
H-H-Harvey. The truck.
Harvey!
Dispatch, you better call 911.
We've got a major accident here.
We're probably gonna
need an ambulance.
l think the condition
of things is just...
l don't think they should
probably even move us.
l'm not sure we should
even be moving at all.
l mean, we should be,
like, restrained.
We're in Scotland
with a bunch of sheep.
l don't know what
this is all about.
Hey.
-Our hoses should be like--
-You all right?
Are you all right?
l need a stabilizing collar.
You probably do, too.
You can't just--we shouldn't
even be moving around...
and nowthere's
sirens in my head.
l probably have a concussion.
Wait. Shh.
-Do you understand?
-That's not your head.
-Listen. Those are--
-You hear them, too?
Yeah, it's the police.
We should go. Come on.
Let's go right now.
Oh, sirens!
Come on down here. Hey!
Listen. Yeah.
Like, real sirens.
You need to--
you need to go up.
Listen to me.
Pay attention to me.
Listen to me. You got to get
Kate and get out of here now.
l got--l'll get
the money, all right?
-l'm going with you.
-No. No.
Go now. Go. Go.
You OK?
Go with Terry
and get out of here now!
Get going.
You all right?
Kate, go with Terry now!
The police!
-l know.
-The police!
Just go with Terry now!
Go! Just go on!
l'm just gonna go put her
in Pollard's car.
Terry, that's Kate
right there. Take her.
The police!
No. We can't go.
We can't leave them.
Stop flailing your arms!
Do you hear sirens?
Because l still hear sirens.
Are they real or not?
Calm down.
Joe will know what to do.
Joe and Pollard
are long gone by now.
His car's still here.
Well, he can get another car.
As a matter of fact,
he can get another girl.
He wouldn't leave without me.
Kate, memo to yourself--
Joe is not exactly...
the flowers-and-hearts
kind of guy...
if you haven't noticed.
And when it comes
to running from the police...
you don't figure
into his thinking...
or mine, either, OK?
Well, l'm not leaving
without him.
Suit yourself.
Well, what are you gonna do?
What am l gonna do?
l'll tell you exactly
what l'm gonna do.
l'm gonna flee from
the scene of the crime...
in the nick of time.
That's what l'm gonna do.
And l'm gonna give
myself a couple of weeks...
to get my heart rate
back to normal...
and then l'm gonna join
Joe at the other bank, OK?
That's what l'm gonna do.
Well, l'm going with you.
You stay away from me forever.
Please don't make me beg.
You are one lucky fella.
l am?
l got the last room in town.
Oh, but that won't do.
l need two rooms.
No. No such thing.
You see all those
cars out there?
lt's a Debbie Day
cosmetic convention.
l've never seen so much
pink in my goddamn life.
lt's a hell of a thing
to do to an automobile.
Right. l don't care what it is.
l have to have two rooms.
Do you want the room or not?
You asleep?
Uh, no, this Weeble-Wobble
song or whatever it is--
it scared me half to death.
You?
l was just wondering
where Joe was.
ls.
Joe pretty much just likes
to have a good time and a--
a good time, basically.
Alone?
You know Joe--
cultural events, museums--
that kind of thing.
He's a very dedicated traveler.
He's not alone.
My husband is a terrible kisser.
That's random.
Like how? What do you mean?
Oh, the first time, you know,
he took me to a movie.
Well, he brought me home...
and l'm standing
at the front door, you know...
waiting for the inevitable...
and he looms, and l'm thinking,
''OK, it's about time...''
and then he...
he just comes at me
with his mouth--
it's just open so--
oh, God, it was really wide.
That's not funny.
l actually--l tried
to adjust to the kiss size.
lt was huge...
and l dislocated my jaw.
lt still clicks.
You can't hear that?
Kind of.
Can l hear it once?
lt's really loud.
Oh, yeah, baby.
That's, uh, l mean,
you know, that's loud.
He dislocated my jaw,
and l still married him.
Oh, l don't know
the first thing about love.
Oh, l know l look
like l do, but l...
l don't.
Not really.
Love is a wish
that hides in your heart...
and nobody knows
about it but you.
Love is blinding.
An eternity in a single moment.
A religion worth dying for.
And it's also time-consuming.
Yeah.
And, uh, you know,
a pain in the ass...
and a hole in the heart
and that sort of thing.
Not necessarily in that order...
but l'd like to think
it is that order, really.
Oh! Bless you.
Gesundheit.
Many happy returns--oh, gosh.
Oh, this is gonna be
one of those.
Really?
Do you--
Hey, do you want me--
you want me to scare you?
No. That's for, uh--this is--
Oh, no, it works. Aah!
No! Don't! That's not--
Now, don't be frightened.
What are you doing to me?
l'm just trying
to block the flow.
You're not helping!
You're not helping!
Good--ow! Jeez!
l'm sorry.
Did l scare you?
l'm sorry.
lt was a bit hard there.
You're dribbling a bit,
but you're not sneezing.
l have food allergies.
Tell me about it.
And other phobias.
Like what?
Like, uh, descrophobia...
which, is, uh...
-What's that?
-Well, l was in high school.
lt's a fear of getting smaller.
l lost two inches
in six months. l mean--
-That's quite significant.
-Terry, you're still here.
And antique furniture
scares me half to death.
What's that called?
Well, l don't think
there's a name for it.
l believe l'm the only one.
Oh, no, no, no.
Anything before 1950...
just gives me
the heebie-jeebies.
Uh, Benjamin Disraeli's hair.
There's a problem there.
l'm afraid of
Charles Laughton, actually.
-Black-and-white movies.
-Black-and-white movies.
Black-and-white movies?
l just can't eat
in front of them.
Oh, my God, l can't either.
You know what? l think
it's better to feel too much...
than feel too little.
l, uh--l never thought of it
that way, but, uh...
Oh, no. You're blinking again?
Well, that--that's just
a ventromedial anomaly.
Well, maybe if l, um--
is that OK?
You see, there's this
neural factory between the eyes.
Between the eyes?
lt's sort of right in--
-There?
-Exactly.
Oh, OK.
Oh, yes, uh...
Yeah. l can--
That kind of thing.
lt's a--oh, yeah.
Outgoing messages
to the nervous system--
that kind of thing. lt's a...
Embarrassment fear.
Oh, it's...big.
Love and hate.
That's a biggie.
Oh, my God.
There's a scientist in London...
who used electric shock...
to prove that cockroaches
have feelings.
Terry, you're not a cockroach.
You're more like a--
you're more like a beaver.
A beaver?
ln a good way.
ln a cute way.
l feel like a cockroach.
l mean, that's assuming
that cockroaches are capable...
of making mistakes that blow
apart the world they live in.
Well, if you're a cockroach...
what does that make me?
Dangerous.
They're here.
Well, were we ever wondering
about you two guys.
We were wondering
and wondering and wondering.
Hey, Joe.
Hi.
Welcome back.
Missed you.
-Yeah. We missed you, too.
-Yeah. We missed you, too.
Joe, can l talk to you
for a minute in private?
Be right back.
Because God knows,
it was a shock to me.
lt was more like
a revelation of some kind...
and yet shocking--
like a shocking revelation.
l was right about
Kate's kisses, wasn't l?
Hmm?
Let me keep her, OK?
l mean, even if you kill me,
l don't give a shit.
l just--l just want to know
what it feels like...
to have her to myself
before l die, OK?
l'm not gonna do that.
l can't do that.
Why, Joe? l mean, remember...
this is like a hobby to you.
lt happens to you
all the time.
lt sort of makes you feel
like a million bucks--
No way.
But it never happens for me.
Not once, Joe.
Not once has this
ever happened for me.
Do you understand
the significance of that?
Yeah.
You do?
So we agree?
We let Kate choose, right?
No, no, no. Of course not.
-That's a terrible idea.
-What's wrong with it?
Because she'll choose you.
Are you boys sure you don't
want to kick my tires first?
You could arm-wrestle.
Oh, that's--yeah.
Or, l don't know, flip a coin.
You know, if it was
best four out of seven--
Unless...
Unless you think that these are
incredibly shallow solutions...
to a complicated problem
that may require...
a little delicacy
and understanding.
Yeah, that...
the last part.
Maybe you're right, Kate.
You should choose.
So choose.
What's it gonna be?
Gonna be, uh...
Mr. Action Figure
hero guy here?
Or brains and sensitivity...
and a lot of other things
l can name.
ln other words,
me or that guy.
Yeah.
Good-looking or itchy?
What if l don't want to?
Don't want to what?
Choose.
You have to choose.
What are you talking about?
That's the point, right?
l know this is confusing.
l mean, believe me...
l'm a little confused myself.
You stole my girl?
You take her away
for two weeks...
and you brainwashed her.
Brainwashed.
You brainwashed her?
l was not stolen.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Would you stop it?
Stop it! Excuse me.
Would you stop this?
You're getting his coat dirty!
Coat?
l mean, look at me. Hello!
Would you look at me
just for a second?
l ran away with bank robbers.
Now, that's a--
that's a strange choice...
but it's understandable
given my state of mind...
but then what do l do?
l sleep with bank robber
number one...
because he's strong...
-And he--
-Handsome.
Handsome, and he--
he knows what he wants.
There you go.
Makes sense to me.
But l don't stop there.
Oh, no. Not this little red hen.
Due to circumstances
beyond the boundaries...
of any life l've ever known...
l sleep with bank robber
number two...
and he is sweet...
and smart and--
Cute as a beaver.
Yeah, and he deserves more
than he thinks he does.
Exactly.
Now, the heart's
a mysterious organ...
and it, you know,
plays by its own rules.
l don't want to choose.
You know, l don't think l can...
and, you know, if that's
scary or against the laws...
of, you know, man or whatever...
then...l mean,
you're outlaws, right?
So...
l guess l'm an outlaw, too.
OK. So, Harvey...
you should park in this alley
right here toward this end.
See? Near the corner
of this building.
You'll be hidden
by the building.
There's a door right here.
And l look up, and l see
these two cars headed...
you know,
right by each other--
Oh, guys.
They collide, right?
And there's this red-headed
woman that's there...
and she's getting hauled off
into the other car.
The Novato, California,
teenager...
had no way of knowing
he was about to capture...
this stunning footage
of the Sleepover Bandits...
and the missing woman
Kate Wheeler.
ln this ''Criminals at Large''
exclusive...
the missing woman's husband
taped a plea to the men...
who hold his wife hostage.
Please. Wherever you are...
return my wife to me.
Kate, if you're listening...
l want you to know that, uh...
l'm OK.
l hope you're holding up well.
l hope these gentlemen
are treating you correctly...
in the way
you should be treated...
and speaking of which,
l'm going to Spain next week...
so, um, if your kidnappers
would like to contact me...
they can get in touch
with my people...
and you know who they are...
and, uh, the house
is waiting for you right here,
where--where you belong.
And, uh...
And the house misses you.
l miss you.
l miss--
He has no idea where l belong.
You belong here.
Yeah, with us.
What are we gonna do
if the sun sets?
-Paradise.
-Yeah.
We buy the restaurant...
and turn it into
a nightclub and a resort.
-A nightclub?
-Yep.
And--and--and--
Joe will work the room...
and l'll--l'll run
the kitchen, naturally.
Have a spa or something.
What does a lady
like me do in Paradise?
Don't be rude.
You can do whatever you want.
-You do whatever you want.
-Whatever--whatever l want?
Drink margaritas,
get your toes painted.
You pick it.
What would you say--
lf you could do anything,
what would it be?
-Whatever l want?
-Yeah, whatever you want.
All right.
l want to sing.
To sing?
Well, we need a singer.
We need a singer
for a nightclub.
-We talked about that.
-All about it, yeah.
-Do you want to--
-You're gonna sing right now?
Do you want me
to sing for you?
Come on.
-OK.
-There it is.
All right, come on.
OK, oldie but a goodie.
lf you see me
walking down the street
And l start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by
Just walk on by
Make believe
That you don't see my tears
Just let me grieve
in private
'Cause each time l see you
l break down and cry
So walk on by
Don't stop
Walk on by
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Well, my system's been a flurry
of activity tonight.
First l--l had
a rapid heartbeat...
seeing spots...
had a prickly sensation
on my feet.
Then there's this sudden
hearing loss in one ear.
That's not what l mean.
Kate, there are
guys who leave...
and there are guys
who get left.
l don't think
it's any mystery...
as to which category
l fall into.
Terry Lee,
l'm not leaving you.
-You're staying?
-Yeah.
-Good night.
-Good night?
That's not staying, it's going.
Where are you going?
Did l get
the secret knock right?
Yeah.
Yeah, it was perfect.
l really missed you
when we were away.
Good night.
lf you want to talk
about headaches...
my brother Albert
had horrible headaches.
-Migraines?
-No. Brain tumor.
He smelled burning feathers
for a whole year.
-You're joking.
-No. His--some--
the tumor was pressing on
some gland or something.
Olfactory gland.
Olfactory gland.
Yeah, that's it.
And apparently it affects
your sense of smell.
Burning feathers?
Yeah. Weird, isn't it?
Did he smell them
all the time?
All the time. 24 hours a day.
Burning feathers. Great.
Were there
any other symptoms?
Oh! Hot damn, l knew it.
You're the boys from TV...
uh, the Sleepover Bandits.
l guess that means
l'm a hostage.
Oh, you better come on in.
We got to get started.
Come on. Come on.
Jeez.
Could you do me a favor?
Could you look at my pupils
and tell me if they're the same?
Are they different sizes?
Are--are they the same?
l'm not a doctor.
Please, humor me.
Well, the right one
looks smaller.
Jesus Christ,
don't tell me that.
You asked.
Do you smell burning feathers?
No.
Brain tumor--l know l do.
-What?
-Yeah, the guy there...
he told me my pupils
are different sizes.
-You're kidding.
-Uh-huh.
Jesus.
First my brother, now you?
God.
Pink.
Harvey.
Harvey.
Hey.
What do you mean, no?
That's what l said. No.
Good manners are no excuse
for criminal behavior.
l am not opening the safe.
l am not giving you the money.
You know we're armed, right?
Oh, you wouldn't
hurt a flea, Joe.
Everybody knows that.
l'm stumped. How about you?
Shit.
Just give us a little bit
of the money.
Be reasonable.
100 grand of it is already...
is--is--is insured
by the government.
Joe?
Hey, get--
just get back there.
Go on. Just get back there.
What the hell is wrong with you?
lt's my bank.
l'm guessing there's
a good reason for this.
Oh, it's the missing woman.
l'd almost forgot.
There's police outside.
-Where's Harvey?
-l don't know.
Will you get back there,
please, ma'am?
Look, look, look.
There's the policeman
right there.
Do you know
where the bathroom is?
Oh, yeah,
it's in the back.
There are home display
towels in there.
l can't believe this.
Hi. l'm sorry to
bother you, Mrs. Carver...
but it's after 8:00...
and you haven't
turned the sign on yet.
And l figured maybe
you'd just forgotten...
the all clear again.
Aww, Edgar, aren't you sweet?
Well, l'll get right on it.
Um, say, you know,
um, l was wondering...
l sure could use some cash,
and, uh, since l'm here...
Oh, sure. Since you're here.
Come in, officer.
Right this way.
Thanks.
Hello.
Uh, 50 bucks OK?
You've been very successful.
Uh, what do you
attribute that to?
Courage--
it takes a lot of that.
This is 500.
These are hundreds.
Oh, bank error in your favor.
Game board kind of joke thing.
Surprise.
You know, it's funny...
l--l think l've seen you
someplace before.
lt's my face.
l have--you know,
l have an average face.
You know how people think--
you look like everyman.
l don't know.
Thanks, Mrs. Carver.
Have a good day.
-All right.
-Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait.
l forgot my glasses.
-Come on.
-Coming.
Oh, shit.
Come on.
-What?
-Terry has the keys.
Terry!
Come on.
Get in the cop car.
Where are they?
Uh, that way.
lt might have been that way.
They're outside. Yes.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop the car.
Police emergency.
There's the car--
a police car. Look!
Just go. Followthat car!
Go! Go! Go!
We can't just leave him there.
There's nothing
we can do for him now.
He'd go back
for you if he had to.
Don't be so sure about that.
Joe, this is Terry
we're talking about.
Remember your friend Terry?
That's it. That's them.
Found Pollard.
You know, Darren...
l mean, l got to be
honest with you.
lt's not that difficult.
You walk in, you ask
for the money, you walk out.
Listen, l don't want
to rush you...
but this would probably
be a good time...
to make your getaway.
Let's go. Come on.
Get away from him.
Get away. Put that down.
Come on, let's go.
Get up. Come on.
lt's only money.
Thank you.
Drive carefully!
Now, let's go.
Dispatch, this is Lincoln Six.
We have an armed robbery--
ls it not enough that every cop
in the western states...
along with every mouth-breathing
reporter is on our ass?
Do you have to
sabotage us from within?
l didn't do it on purpose.
That's not the point.
The point is you're dangerous...
and you're dense
and you're stupid.
-You're fired.
-No way. l quit.
-Harvey.
-Call it what you want.
He's right, you know?
l'm not a bank robber.
l'm a stunt man.
Besides, you don't need me.
You--you got Kate.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
l quit.
You could have put us
back in jail, Harvey.
l'm sorry, Joe.
Maybe l'll see
you guys in Mexico.
OK.
Nice car.
lt's not mine. l stole it.
What are you gonna do now?
Drive it to Hollywood.
Yeah, why?
l'm a stunt man.
Oh.
Do you want to come with me?
No.
Aww.
-Hey, Terry?
-Yeah?
Remember what l told you
about my brother...
the one with the brain tumor...
who was always smelling
burning feathers?
lt's emblazoned
on my brain forever.
You know, he never quit...
never gave up trying,
right to the very end.
Hey, Joe?
l know just how he feels.
Good night, Joe.
Do you guys--do you guys...
You've been together
for quite a while.
Do you consider yourselves
good friends still?
-Oh, sure.
-Absolutely.
People say there's
no honor among thieves.
To--totally wrong. Right, Joe?
Totally wrong.
Darren, it's like, uh--
uh, Lewis and Clark.
You got Lewis,
he--he--he's stuck...
somewhere out there in Africa...
lost in the African wilderness.
And, uh--uh, Clark...
Al Clark,
l think his name was...
he--he drops what he's doing...
and he goes to find him.
He goes to find Lewis,
and you know why?
Because of friendship,
that's why.
For God's sake, Joe...
it was--was Stanley
and Livingstone...
not Lewis and Clark.
You see, Lewis and Clark...
tried to find
the Northwest Passage...
with the help of this
statuesque lndian lady.
-But you probably--
-But they were friends, OK?
Of course they were.
He was asking us
about friendship.
You always got to correct me.
l'm sorry. You're right.
You're up.
l--l couldn't sleep.
l was thinking maybe...
that you and l could
go to this place.
Where is Joe?
He's asleep, sound asleep.
Terry?
He is. He's sound asleep.
lf we could maybe
come down to this, uh...
bar down here at the thing...
and maybe just sit there...
and have a nightcap
or something like that.
lt's a little late,
don't you think?
Oh, no. Gosh, not at all.
What--it's the--
you know, live.
You know, act like
it's the last...
most important thing
you'll ever do in your life.
Please?
All right.
l'll just get a coat.
OK.
l love this song.
Actually,
l never heard it before.
l have to press A 1
on these things.
lt's an obsessive-compulsive
thing.
lt's a pretty song, though.
l played it six times.
Just run away with me,
Kate, please.
Let's get in the car...
and we'll just drive and drive
and drive and drive...
and then we'll stop
at the perfect place...
and we'll stay there
for as long as we want to...
and then we'll get back
in the car...
and then we'll drive and drive
and drive and drive...
and we'll find
another perfect place.
l'm just--
this is kind of
sudden, isn't it?
This is crazy.
Well, not to me, it isn't.
l need a whiskey.
Can l have a whiskey, please?
l'd like a vodka, please.
And a glass of milk.
Could you warm the milk?
Got a right side problem
of some sort.
God, l hope l'm not having
a brain tumor.
Hi, Terry.
How's it going?
Hi, Joe.
What's going on?
Not much. Just...
You're here by yourself?
You OK?
l'm having trouble feeling
my lips a little.
They're not numb, are they?
-A little bit numb.
-Oh, boy.
Joe.
Hi.
l thought you were asleep.
Yeah. l was asleep.
He woke up.
Anybody want to dance?
No, l don't think so.
Why don't you dance with Kate?
-Not me.
-Go ahead. Go ahead.
l'm not really a dancer.
Come on...Terry?
-Dance with her.
-l can't feel my arm.
l'd rather not, Kate.
Kate's got her
dancing clothes on.
Go on over there and dance.
-You all right?
-You kids have fun.
-You all right?
-Oh, yeah. l'm just fine.
You're kind of tilting.
Yeah, well, it's just
a momentary thing.
Actually, l'm very,
very light on my feet.
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.
l'm a pretty good dancer.
There you go.
You're an all-right dancer.
Looking good, Terry.
Such a pretty song.
Dance with me, Kate.
Oh, maybe you should do
most of the dancing.
-Happy?
-What, honey?
Mind if l cut in?
Yeah, sure.
l've lost the beat.
-Don't you think we should--
-No, he'll be fine.
Just take a little rest.
You guys sure, um...
Come here. Dance with me.
Run away with me, Kate.
We can get in the car and just
drive and drive and drive.
You know what?
That is a great idea.
What about Mexico?
Mexico will wait.
Well, what about Terry?
Terry will just
have to wait, too.
Come on.
l am so confused.
ln what way?
ln every possible way.
Just come on outside
with me for a minute. Come on.
-l've got a hot milk.
-What?
l got Terry some hot milk.
l'll just get him the hot milk.
l'll check on Terry.
You all right?
Here, l got you some milk.
Help you sleep.
l'm lactose intolerant.
You're what?
Lactose intolerant.
You're lactose intolerant?
Severe diarrhea.
Severe diar--
Right.
l'll just be outside
here on the porch.
Kate, can you smell
burning feathers?
Burning feathers?
Joe's older brother Albert.
He smelled burning feathers.
He had a brain tumor.
Joe doesn't have
an older brother.
l have no right side.
No right side?
ls that what Joe told you?
Can you feel this?
Yes, l feel that. lt hurt.
Joe doesn't have a brother?
-No brother.
-Albert?
No Albert.
So the burning feathers
was a lie.
Yup.
-You're sure?
-Positive.
Where is Joe?
Outside.
Joe, l've been thinking.
Yeah, me, too.
l've been thinking that
l don't have a brain tumor...
because you never had a brother.
And l can walk, too.
Did you notice that, Joe?
Look at me. l'm walking.
l'm walking around you. See?
Never cheat a pal.
Never cheat a pal.
lsn't that what you always say?
-You cheated me first.
-l did not.
You cheated me first!
No! Bullshit!
What about Paradise?
l don't give a damn
about Paradise.
l'm out of here.
Well, guess what.
Me, too, OK? Happy?
You won't make it a week
without me, and you know it.
l will with Kate.
Over my dead body!
That hurt!
You little shithead!
-You bit me!
-Stop it!
-You hit me!
-Would you stop it?
Oh, God.
This is over.
Not until somebody
is either dead or in a coma.
And l hope it's him.
No, l'm talking about us.
l won't watch you do this
to each other.
l just--l can't.
l'd rather see you in prison.
At least there you'd be safe
from each other.
And yes, l'm aware that this
is entirely my own fault.
lt's just that l...
l bit off a little bit more
than l could chew.
But l...
l've just never felt
this way before, and...
l...
l can't choose between you.
What if everyone
only has one big love?
l mean, l knowthis one's
a little bit...
bigger than usual, but...
what if we only have one?
And you know why
l can't choose between you?
Because together, you're...
you're the perfect man.
Kate.
Kate, we weren't really
gonna even--right?
Yeah.
l'm sorry, boys.
This is over.
Kate!
Kate!
Big, isn't it?
lt's just a bank.
Big.
Yeah. lt's big.
Oh, my God.
lt's them. They're here.
Oh, Mama.
Kate Wheeler may have
started out as a hostage...
but she's looking more and more
like a bank robber to me.
That's ridiculous.
There's no way you can calculate
the impact of her captivity.
This is Patty Hearst
all over again.
lf you recall,
Patty Hearst went to prison.
Which was a mistake.
Excuse me.
lt's long distance.
You're in love--
Hold on a minute.
Don't tell her
you love her right now.
Both of us...
Yeah, she knows it.
Listen. Listen.
l miss you.
And Joe misses you.
What l'm trying to say
is we both miss you.
Equally.
Equally.
We both miss you equally.
Hi. Hi. How you doing?
Well, we've been--
we've been, um, thinking.
l've been doing
some thinking, too.
What were you thinking?
l can't live like this.
l mean, that's the first thing.
Well...take it.
Which is entirely our fault,
and we take full responsibility.
Full.
Really.
Absolutely.
No, it doesn't matter
whose fault it is.
Not anymore.
Let me talk to her.
Listen to me.
What if l told you there
was a way out of this?
One more big score, OK?
Just one. Nice and safe.
Oh, l don't like
the sound of this.
Well, no, no.
No more tricks. No more tricks.
No more sleepovers.
We just walk in...
we showthem our guns,
we take the money...
You showthem your guns?
But we got it all figured out.
No, l can't let you do this.
Oh, no, please don't do this.
lt's a really bad idea.
Kate, Kate, listen to me.
Listen to me.
This will work. OK?
The reward for the capture of
Joe Blake and Terry Collins...
has been doubled
to a million dollars.
The question now
is how much longer...
the two can continue
their crime spree.
Their faces are known
to just about everyone...
-Good morning.
-How you doing? Let's go.
Outside. Come on. Go on.
Keep moving, shorty.
Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?
Shut up.
-Let's go.
-All right. All right.
Come on. You, too.
ln front of us.
ln front of us.
Here we go.
Good evening, everybody.
l'm Darren Head, and welcome
to ''Criminals at Large.''
We have a very interesting...
and unusual show
for you this evening.
lf you can look behind me,
you see that we're not here
on the set
of ''Criminals at Large.''
We're broadcasting tonight
out of my home...
out of my living room.
The Sleepover Bandits,
Joe Blake and Terry Collins...
are sitting with me.
They wanted to set the record
straight about Kate Wheeler.
l want to say to you,
to the American public...
to all of the law
enforcement agencies...
out there across America...
Kate Wheeler was never involved
in the bank robberies with us.
She was our hostage.
She was an unwilling hostage.
She was never, ever involved.
Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning.
You are about to be robbed.
l'm Kate Wheeler.
Keep your hands
where l can see them.
Where's the bank manager?
Very good, sir. Come with me.
OK, nobody move.
Right there on the corner.
Lay down.
l'd never heard them
talk like that before.
And they're armed
and they're dangerous...
and l think they're serious.
All right,
let's make contact with them.
The SWATteam
is standing around.
The helicopters are overhead.
lt's an incredible scene here
at the Alamo Savings & Loan.
lt's ringing.
Yeah? Let me tell you something.
This is Joe Blake, OK?
You will never take us alive.
Do you understand me?
Now, we want safe passage
to Burbank Airport...
and we want a plane to fly us
out of there.
No, no more phone calls, OK?
You just do what l ask you.
Hey, you are not
gonna take us alive!
''You're not
gonna take us alive''?
That's right.
Great thinking, Joe.
How about they
will not take YOU alive?
You know, l'm flattered
that you've included me...
in your little ''going out
in a hail of gunfire...''
kind of concept
and everything...
but l think
you've gone nuts, frankly.
The troops are moving in here.
The SWATteam is moving in.
The helicopters are overhead.
lf you look in the background...
you can see
Joe Blake and Terry Collins.
They're in the bank.
The hostages are still in there.
Everybody hold your positions.
l'm all through running, Terry.
Well, guess what. l am, too.
But l got a better idea.
l'm gonna throw down my weapon
and put my hands in the air...
and go back to
the federal penitentiary...
where Kate Wheeler wants us.
-Can't let you do that.
-Oh, really?
What if l don't give you
that option?
Everybody hold your position.
Guys, just hold on one second.
-Put that gun down.
-Make me.
-Make me?
-Yes, make me!
What the hell is this,
the third grade?
You can't do
any better than that?
l'm all out of well-turned
phrases at this point, Joe.
All right, the suspects are
in a standoff with themselves.
Put your gun down!
Hey, don't even think about it!
Don't you point
that gun at him!
Now, get out of here, mister!
The rest of you, too!
Don't move! Hey! Hey!
That's a hostage coming out.
That's a hostage.
lt looks like somebody's
coming out of the bank.
Somebody's come
out of the bank.
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
are in there.
Hold it down. Shut them--
Shut up!
Shots fired inside.
You shot me!
Stinking bastard!
Oh, God!
Be advised. The suspects
are shooting at each other.
You son of a bitch!
All right. On Terry.
Stand by.
Hold your position.
On red team.
Everybody just hold.
All right.
This'll be the shotgun on Terry.
Now.
Wonderful.
The suspects appear
to be down inside.
Applause.
Red team, go.
Secure them.
-What is she doing?
-Come on. Let's go.
This is unbelievable.
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
are down.
We can't tell if the police shot
them or they shot themselves.
And it looks like Kate Wheeler's
up on the stairs...
and she fainted.
And if you followed this story
the last couple of weeks...
you know that Kate Wheeler
is the woman...
that turned in
the Sleepover Bandits.
l need some help up here
for Ms. Wheeler.
Let's move. Now.
Pick her up.
Come on. Get a shot!
Get a shot of her, right there.
Ms. Wheeler, you fainted
on the steps there.
Was that--were you in shock?
What happened there?
Yes. l was in complete shock.
Ms. Wheeler, is it true that
you tipped off the police...
to today's bank robbery?
Yes, uh, l did.
But none of this was, um...
was supposed to happen.
l just wanted them to,
um, to stop.
l'm stuck.
Hey!
Good morning, sunshine.
Open the bag.
Come on. Let's go.
Great job, you guys.
Great job.
We're getting out of here.
OK. Let's go. Grab the money.
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
-Oh, my God!
-Go!
lt's gonna blow!
You gotta run.
lt's gonna blow!
...downtown area
with another stunning turn...
in today's big story.
The vehicle transporting
the bodies...
of the Sleepover Bandits
has exploded.
Apparently, the bodies
were wired with explosives.
The bodies were
totally incinerated...
with no trace of Joe Blake
and Terry Collins.
Here's to Paradise.
To us.
You better wait for me...
'cause l'm bringing
the sunscreen...
and the million-dollar reward.
And so ends the tragic tale
of the Sleepover Bandits.
Or does it?
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
captured the imagination...
of a nation.
And in death, their lives
are quickly becoming...
the stuff of legend.
Blake and Collins
weren't heroes.
They never claimed to be.
After the interview, people came
up to me and said...
''What were they really like?''
l know as much as anybody else.
They robbed banks.
They certainly kidnapped
the wrong woman.
And they shot each other
to death in cold blood.
The rest is rumor
and speculation--
the stuff of folk tales.
And in the end, maybe that's
the way we really want it to be.
l'm Darren Head.
We'll see you next week
on another edition...
of ''Criminals at Large.''
Fade to black.
That should do it.
...consented together
in holy matrimony.
Yhan testificado lo mismo,
ante Dios...
y todos los presentes.
And have witnessed the same
before God and this company.
And have pledged their love
to each other.
And have declared the same
by the joining...
and the giving of the rings.
Y por lo tanto, con la autoridad
del Estado...
los pronuncio esposo y esposa.
The groom may now kiss
the bride.
Hi, gentlemen.
So, why don't we start
from the beginning, all right?
How'd you guys meet?
Well, uh, lifting weights,
pumping the iron, you know...
in the usual way--
trading cigarettes.
Terry had imaginary
appendicitis...
and then he had, uh,
imaginary blood poisoning.
l was working in the infirmary.
The medical term is septicemia,
and it wasn't...
Anyway, one night
in the infirmary...
l'm hearing
this howling sound...
uh, Darren.
You know, like a--like a...
like the noise a cat makes
when a cat's in heat...
that ''Rrrr. Rrrr.''
That little sound, you know?
One of the things we always
like to remind ourselves...
before we'd run into any job was
expect the unexpected, right?
Right?
Always sounds like good advice.
Except, of course, if you are
expecting the unexpected...
then...well, then, it really
isn't unexpected anymore, is it?
And that leaves you vulnerable
to the truly unexpected.
Because you're not expecting it.
Everybody sawthe videotape--
it's kind of famous by now--
of Kate Wheeler,
the bank robbery.
Why don't you,
right here on this show...
set the record straight about
Kate Wheeler and your operation.
l mean, the girl was terrified,
you know, with us, l think.
Both as men and as bank robbers.
And didn't like us.
Never liked us.
-We never got along...
-No.
from the very first
moment we met.
Don't you guys ever get
really scared?
l mean, this job is
so dangerous.
l'm immune to danger.
l dance with danger.
l walk up to danger and tug it
on the ears and sneer at it...
and make funny faces at it.
l just, you know--
''You know what? Come on.''
ls what l'm saying.
You know what you
have to be like?
You have to have
nerves of steel...
and l have a nervous system
which, l mean, as a child...
God knows, l was a nervous kid.
l was a nervous kid.
But, you know, you get in there.
There's something
about the adrenaline...
and what are you laughing at?
You're immune.
l'm immune.
l'm immune to danger.
You're totally immune.
