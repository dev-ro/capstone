 ( instrumental music
 playing )
OKAY.
MM, THIS LOOKS GOOD.
THERE YOU GO, KITTY.
MM.
IT'S GOOD, HUH?
YEAH.
 ( thunder rumbling )
- ( mews )
- HEY HEY.
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- OKAY, LET'S GO INSIDE.
- ( mews )
OH, I KNOW.
* GO TO SLEEP,
LITTLE KITTY *
* GO TO SLEEP, LITTLE KITTY 
* DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES *
* TILL THE SUN'S
IN THE SKY. *
 ( thunder rumbling )
- WE'RE CLOSING NOW, ROGER.
- CAN I HAVE ONE FOR
THE ROAD, THOUGH?
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- JUST-- JUST ONE MORE.
- JUST FOR THE ROAD.
- NO.
FOR THE ROAD.
JUST ONE FOR THE ROAD.
THERE'S THE FUCKIN' ROAD!
NOW GO.
OH GOD.
- JESUS CHRIST.
- ( muttering )
( groaning )
 ( loud rumbling )
 ( New Age music playing )
Man:
 Welcome to the world
 of relaxation.
 By following
 my exercises
 you will enhance
 your ability to relax.
 Now I want you
 to touch your index finger
 with your thumb.
 This gesture
 is to symbolize
 the link between
 the body and the mind.
 Now close your eyes.
 I want you to take
 a deep breath.
 And now slowly exhale.
( exhales )
 You are entirely at peace
 with your environment.
( grunts )
 You feel calm.
 You feel tranquil.
 I want you to visualize
 the scene I describe.
 I want you to mentally
 recreate every detail.
- ( police sirens blaring )
- ( sighs )
 You are lying
 on an endless white beach.
 The sun is rising.
- ( sighs )
- Feel the palm trees
  swaying--
OOH OOH!
- ( barking )
- ( grunting, groaning )
- ( sighing )
- ( barking )
( hiccupping )
- ( hiccupping continues )
- ( footsteps approaching )
Woman:
THERE YOU GO.
JUST DRINK YOUR MILK
IN ONE GO.
THAT SHOULD TAKE AWAY
THE HICCUPS.
- AM I DEAD?
- NO, YOU'RE LUCKY.
OH.
OKAY.OKAY.
OH, JACQUES, NOT AGAIN.
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST DIE?
GOOD TO SEE
YOU TOO, OLIVIA.
( humming )
 ( gurney rattling )
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
THIS IS NOT MY WARD.
( with accent )
I HAVE TOLD YOU 100 TIMES--
THIS IS A HOSPITAL,
NOT A ZOO.
WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN
STRICT HYGIENIC STANDARDS.
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
A FUCKIN' WORD
YOU'RE SAYING.
 CALL THE FUCKING
 ORIENTAL EMBASSY
AND MAKE THEM SEND OVER
AN INTERPRETER IMMEDIATELY.
YOU HAVE TO GET RID
OF THE DOG.
IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO STAY HERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.
HE'S GOT A NAME, YOU KNOW.
HIS NAME'S ROCOCO.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT'S HIS NAME.
HE'S GOT TO LEAVE.
GO BACK TO THE THIRD WORLD,
YOU CHINKY CORIANDER BITCH!
I HOPE YOU DROP DEAD.
DO ME A FAVOR--
UNPLUG THE SMOKE DETECTOR.
WHAT?
UNPLUG THE SMOKE DETECTOR.
 NOW THERE ARE TWO BOXES
 ON THE LEFT ON THE WALL.
THE LITTLE ONE ABOVE.
TWO DOORS-- OPEN THEM.
NOW UNPLUG THE GREEN WIRE.
 YES, THAT'S IT.
 ( alarm blaring )
( groans )
 ( dice rattling )
SO WHAT THE FUCK
HAPPENED TO YOU?
SUICIDE... ATTEMPT.
NOT SUCCESSFUL.
JESUS.
EVERY SINGLE DAY
I'M FIGHTING
A BLOODY BATTLE
FOR MY LIFE.
AT THE SAME TIME, SOME MORON
IN THE PRIME OF HIS YOUTH
IS READY TO THROW HIS LIFE
STRAIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- HEART ATTACK NUMBER FIVE.
SO, LUCAS,
I HOPE THE HOSPITAL'S
BEEN TREATING YOU WELL.
( chuckles )
 I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
 TO SEEING YOU TODAY.
ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT
WE MAY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
SOME THINGS THAT
YOU MAY FIND UNPLEASANT.
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY,
BUT I HAVE TO ASK IT.
WHY DID YOU TRY SUICIDE?
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT COMES
TO SURVIVAL
OF THE FITTEST,
I JUST HAVE TO THROW IN
THE TOWEL, I GUESS.
 BUT YOU'RE NOT
 AN ANIMAL, LUCAS.
YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING.
YOU LIVE IN
A HIGHLY-DEVELOPED SOCIETY
THAT HAS ALL KINDS OF
BUFFERS AND SECURITY NETS
THAT ARE DESIGNED
TO BREAK YOUR FALL.
NO.I DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES
OF CIVILIZATION ANYMORE.
I AM OUTSIDE.
I AM AN ANIMAL.
( sighs )
TRY TO THINK OF LIFE
AS A COCONUT:
 IT'S HARD
 ON THE OUTSIDE,
AND IF YOU DON'T
HAVE THE PROPER TOOLS
OR THE KNOW-HOW,
IT CAN SEEM TOTALLY
USELESS AND FUTILE.
BUT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO OPEN IT,
THERE'S SWEET JUICE INSIDE.
 BUT THE KEY IS NOT TO KEEP
 THE COCONUT TO YOURSELF.
ONCE YOU LEARN
HOW TO OPEN THE COCONUT,
YOU SHARE THE COCONUT
WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS
NO COCONUT.
AND THEN YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPINESS IS.
- SHARE THE COCONUT?
- YES.
I AM VERY THANKFUL
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE
AND GIVEN ME
FOOD TO EAT
AND CLOTHES TO WEAR.
I WISH I COULD PAY YOU
BACK IN SOME WAY,
BUT I HAVE
NOTHING TO GIVE...
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- ...EXCEPT FOR MY SPERM.
I WOULD LIKE
TO DONATE MY SPERM.
NO NO.
I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
IT'S AWFULLY KIND OF YOU,
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT
DOING YOU A PERSONAL FAVOR
THAT YOU HAVE TO REPAY.
THIS IS A HOSPITAL.
WE'RE JUST DOING OUR JOB.
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IS THAT YOU SURVIVED.
PLEASE, THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO.
WELL, IF YOU INSIST
ON DOING SOMETHING FOR US,
I COULD SIGN YOU UP
AS AN ORGAN DONOR.
THERE'S ALWAYS
A BIG NEED FOR ORGANS.
MY WHOLE BODY.
I AM READY TO DONATE MY BODY
AND MY SOUL TO SCIENCE.
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO START WITH?
A KIDNEY?
YOU JUST TAKE
WHATEVER YOU NEED.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
AND HERE'S A LITTLE
FAREWELL GIFT FROM THE STAFF
TO HELP MAKE
YOUR NEW START
A GOOD ONE.
OH.
 ( car horn honking )
( mews )
( buzzing )
 ( buzzing continues )
- WHAT IS IT?
- WHERE'S LUCAS?
YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED
TO USE THIS BELL IN CASE
OF EMERGENCY.
WHERE'S LUCAS?
WELL, I SUPPOSE LUCAS
IS FREE TO GO WHERE HE WANTS
WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION.
SON OF A MOTHER FUCKIN'
LESBIAN BITCH.
LUC?
( laughing )
- WHAT UP, MAN?
- HEY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS.
BOY, YOU LOOK GOOD
AS A GOVERNMENT CHECK.
HOW YOU BEEN?
UH, I'VE...
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
A LITTLE ILL RECENTLY.
- YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
THE WEATHER, HUH?
- YEAH.
BUT YOU'RE BACK
ON ALL FOURS NOW,
AIN'T YOU, CAT?
YEAH, DOING MUCH BETTER.
THANK YOU, POET.
- I KNOW YOU'RE A STEPPER.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
TOUGH TITTY FOR A KITTY,
BUT THE MILK IS GOOD HOT.
- BUT IT'S FAIR
OUT HERE, MAN.
- YEAH, I KNOW.
A LITTLE GRIND,
TRYING TO KEEP
A FEW DOLLARS
OF THE LUNCH MONEY
IN THE POCKET.
- I KNOW. ME TOO, POET.
- IT JUST AIN'T EASY, BABE.
OH, HEY, I ACTUALLY FELL INTO
A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS RECENTLY.
- HEY, AIN'T THAT A BLESSING?
- MAYBE I COULD LEND YOU A FEW.
HEY, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER YOU CAN STAND, KID.
- I APPRECIATE THIS, MAN.
- THERE YOU GO.
SO EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT, HUH?
EXCUSE ME,
I WAS WONDERING
BY ANY CHANCE CAN YOU,
LIKE, GIVE A DOLLAR OR TWO?
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OF COURSE I CAN.
HERE.
MOST APPRECIATIVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, MAY I HAVE SOME,
PLEASE?
- YES.
- I'M HIS FRIEND.
- NO NO, I KNOW.
- HE'S MY FRIEND.
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU.
- THERE YOU GO.OKAY.
- HOW ABOUT ME?
- THAT'S FOR YOU.
- THANKS.
AND THAT'S FOR YOU.
ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY.
 ( footsteps approaching )
WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?
THESE FILES ARE
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
NOW GET OUT.
( sniffing )
- ( barks )
- LUCAS?
 LUCAS, YOU LITTLE PUNK.
- YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
- WHAT?
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
I APPRECIATE IT,
JACQUES,
BUT I-- I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO BE LEFT ALONE.
COME WITH ME, LUCAS.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
YOU COULD DO WITH
SOME HELP YOURSELF.
OH SHIT.
 OKAY.
BOMBS AWAY.
 ( revving engine )
AH.
( chuckles )
Lucas:
 HOUSE OF OYSTERS?
WHY IS IT CALLED
HOUSE OF OYSTERS?
WELL, WHEN I BOUGHT
THE PLACE,
BACK IN THE DAYS,
IT WAS AN OLD OYSTER BAR
RUN BY THE LATE
MR. SAVIOLA.
 BUT AFTER A CUSTOMER
 CONSUMED A LETHAL OYSTER,
 MR. SAVIOLA WAS FORCED
 TO CLOSE DOWN THE BUSINESS.
BUT I KEPT THE NAME BECAUSE
IT'S THE NAME OF THE BAR,
AND A BAR SHOULD NOT
CHANGE ITS NAME,
NO MATTER WHAT GOES WRONG
IN THE WORLD.
COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,
WHEN THE SMOG DISSOLVES,
YOU GOTTA TRUST THAT YOUR BAR
IS STILL GONNA BE THERE.
 WE'RE READY.
 SEND IT OVER.
- ( receiver clatters )
- ( Jacques sighs )
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- LIKEWISE.
CHIN LEE
IS MY EXCELLENT COOK.
- MONEYED SALE.
- THANK YOU, CHIN LEE.
Jacques:
MY HEART'S NO GOOD.
I COULD PASS AWAY
ANY DAY NOW.
I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY,
NO FRIENDS,
AND I'M NOT EVEN INTERESTED
IN ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN
IS THAT THIS BAR GOES ON
AFTER I'M GONE.
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME
INTO THE PICTURE, LUCAS.
WHEN I'M GONE, I WANT YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON'T LIKE IT.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
YOU USED TO EAT
OUT OF GARBAGE CANS.
BUT WHEN PRESENTED WITH
THE HEIGHTS OF GASTRONOMY,
YOU REFUSE IT?
SORRY.
YOU HAVE MANY THINGS
TO LEARN, MY FRIEND.
AND I'M NOT
GONNA GIVE UP
UNTIL I'VE TAUGHT
YOU EVERYTHING.
FROM NOW ON,
YOU'RE MY STUDENT.
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.
AND THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
HERE'S SOME PAJAMAS.
 TOMORROW'S GONNA
 BE A BUSY DAY.
 ( door closes )
OPEN UP!
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU MORONS?
WHY IS THE BAR
CLOSED, JACQUES?
- I'M TRAINING A NEW EMPLOYEE.
- HOW LONG IS THAT GONNA TAKE?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- COME ON.
GIVE US AN IDEA.
A DAY, A YEAR, OR WHAT?
FOR GOD'S SAKE, STOP WHINING
AND GO BACK TO YOUR MOTHERS.
- BUT I WANNA GET A DRINK.
- MY MOTHER'S DEAD.
YOU KNOW THAT.
 COME ON, JACQUES.
JACQUES!
WELL, LONG SEE
NO TIME.
- ( chuckling )
- AH.
 HOW YOU DOING?
 HOW'S THE OLD HEART?
TERRIBLE AS USUAL,
DIMITRI.
- I HAVEN'T FUCKED
SINCE LAST CENTURY.
- OH, NO.
THE CLOSEST I'VE COME
TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY
IS BRUSHING MY TEETH.
OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE,
JACQUES.
BUT YOU STILL MANAGE
TO GET A BONER?
- HARDLY.
- OH, I'M SO SORRY,
JACQUES.
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND?
- WHERE IS YOUR
BEAUTIFUL WIFE?
- ( chuckles )
- SARAH!
- YES?
JACQUES WANTS TO
SAY HELLO TO YOU.
 OKAY, COMING.
OH, SARAH!
SARAH, SARAH, SARAH!
( laughing )
- HI, JACQUES.
- ( sniffs )
 OH MY GOD,
 YOU SMELL SO GOOD.
- THANK YOU, JACQUES.
- OH GOD, YOU SMELL GOOD.MM!
- OKAY, JACQUES.
- IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, SARAH.
- JACQUES.
- OKAY, IT'S ENOUGH.
- HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
- JACQUES!
- WHAT?
- TAKE IT EASY.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, JACQUES.
- WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, SARAH.
- COME BACK SOON.
- VERY VERY SOON.
- WHERE WERE WE?
- I DON'T KNOW, JACQUES.
- WHY'D YOU COME?
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
- OH YEAH.
YOU SEE THIS
YOUNG GENTLEMAN?
I PULLED HIM
OUT OF THE GUTTER.
WE NEED TO GET HIM
PENGUINIZED.
JEEZ, WE'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.
WELL, BRING IT ON,
YOU FUCKING COMMUNIST.
WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.
- TAKE IT EASY, JACQUES.
- WHAT?
I MEAN,
YOU BURST INTO MY STORE,
YOU HARASS MY WIFE,
AND NOW YOU
START CRITICIZING
MY PAST AS WELL?
I'M NOT CRITICIZING YOU,
DIMITRI.
IT WAS A JOKE.
JEEZ.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
SO SENSITIVE ABOUT YOUR
COMMUNISTIC PAST.
CAN I CALL YOU
A CAPITALISTIC SWINE?
WOULD THAT WORK
FOR YOU, DIMITRI?
JEEZ.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
YOU GOT HEMORRHOIDS
OR SOMETHING?
THESE ARE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES
I HAVE EVER SEEN
IN MY LIFE, JACQUES,
- BUT THEY ARE SO STIFF.
- JESUS.
- ( organ music playing )
- Jacques: NO ARTY-FARTY
  FASHION BULLSHIT.
JUST A DECENT HAIRCUT.
CRAFTSMANSHIP, HONESTY--
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
YOU ARE IN
THE RIGHT PLACE, JACQUES.
I DON'T TRUST YOU.
( music stops )
OH, HERE.
WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES
OF WHAT IS GOING ON
RIGHT NOW
IN CASE YOU NEED
SOME INSPIRATION.
HEY HEY HEY HEY.
I SAID NO FASHION CRAP.
HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN
MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION
OF HIS OWN?
NO.IT IS I WHO'LL PAY
FOR THE OPERATION
AND IT IS I
WHO'LL CONDUCT IT.
SO PLEASE STOP
GETTING ON MY NERVES
AND JUST DO YOUR JOB.
MY JOB?
- HOW DARE YOU?
- FAGGOT.
OH-- OH DEAR, HAVE I--
HAVE I NICKED YOU?
OH NO, BLOOD.
I'M GONNA SUE YOUR FLAMING
WRINKLED HOMOSEXUAL ASS OFF,
YOU FUCKING MORON.
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
JESUS, JACQUES,
I FEEL STRANGE ABOUT THIS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- DON'T YOU TRUST ME?
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S-- IT'S LIKE PEOPLE TAKE
AN EDUCATION TO LEARN THIS.
- YOU KNOW, FIVE YEARS
OR SOMETHING.
- WHERE YOU BEEN?
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ROCKET SCIENCE, YOU KNOW.
IT'S A KNIFE--
THE OLDEST TOOL
KNOWN TO MAN.
OKAY.
- JUST BE CAREFUL.
- TRUST ME.
OH NO...
BLOOD.
( ragtime music playing )
 ( men chattering )
OKAY OKAY, LISTEN UP,
GENTLEMEN.
I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE LUCAS.
- HOW YOU DOING, LUCAS?
- HI, LUCAS.
Man:
 YOU ACT LIKE
 A WOMAN, THOUGH.
 BECAUSE THIS IS
 FEMALE BEHAVIOR.
WOMEN, WHEN THEY HEAR THAT
MEN LIVE WITH THEIR MOMMIES,
IT'S NOT SO SEXY.
- Man: BELIEVE ME,
  I DON'T TELL THEM--
- Man #2: YOU'RE VERY PASSIVE.
 I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
 MORE PASSIVE THAN YOU.
Man:
 WELL, THE TIMES THAT
 IT'S WORKED FOR ME IS WHEN--
Man #2:
 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
 YOU WERE ON A DATE?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
BUT, LIKE, IF I'M GOING OUT
OR IF I'M GOING TO A MOVIE,
LIKE I GOTTA GO
TO A MOVIE UPTOWN,
I'LL TAKE THE TRAIN.
( chattering continues )
( room falls silent )
OH MY GOD,
WE'VE GOT A WALK-IN.
WE'VE GOT A WALK-IN.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I'LL HAVE A BLOODY MARY,
PLEASE.
AND DO YOU HAVE
ORGANIC TOMATO JUICE?
SORRY, WE'RE OUT OF CELERY.
BUT THEN IF YOU
ARE GOING UPTOWN,
- YOU ARE TAKING WHAT?
- LUCAS.
WE DON'T DO WALK-INS.
WHAT?
- Man: EAGER.
- EAGER BEAVER.
- ( men laughing )
- LUCAS.
NEVER REMOVE
AN EMPTY GLASS.
IT IS THE CUSTOMER'S
HISTORY,
THE TRACK RECORD
OF HIS STATE OF MIND--
AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION
WHICH SHOULD NOT
BE FIXED NOR FALSIFIED.
HEY, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Jacques's voice:
 OVERVIEW OVERVIEW OVERVIEW.
 YOU HAVE TO KNOW
 WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
 EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER.
 WHO'S DRINKING WHAT?
 WHO NEEDS A REFILL?
 WHO WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE?
 EACH REGULAR HAS
 THEIR OWN ROUTINE
 WHICH YOU HAVE
 TO LEARN BY HEART.
 A DECENT BARTENDER KNOWS
 WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS
 BEFORE HE KNOWS IT HIMSELF.
( till rings )
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU TAKE
THE DAY'S EARNINGS
AND YOU PUT IT
RIGHT IN HERE.
- INTO THE FREEZER?
- INTO THE FREEZER.
I'VE BEEN BURGLARIZED
TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION.
AND I AIN'T LOST
A SINGLE DIME--
NOT SINCE I STARTED
FREEZING MY MONEY.
THIS IS ENRIQUE.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
 IN FACT,
 MY ONLY FRIEND.
 HE LIVES IN MARTINIQUE
 WHERE HE GROWS
AND HANDPICKS
MY COFFEE BEANS.
WONDERFUL PERSON.
AND THIS IS HIS MOTHER,
JOSEPHINE.
IF I WASN'T
IN SUCH BAD SHAPE,
I'D GO STRAIGHT
TO MARTINIQUE AND MARRY HER.
WHO'S THE LITTLE GIRL?
AH.
THAT IS ENRIQUE'S
BEAUTIFUL NINE-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER, FELICIA.
I WANT YOU TO MARRY HER.
WHEN SHE'S
A LITTLE BIT OLDER.
Jacques:
 FOR OVER 15 YEARS
 HE'S DROPPED BY
EVERY SINGLE DAY
FOR ONE CUP OF ESPRESSO.
 HE NEVER SAYS GOOD MORNING,
 NEVER SAYS WHAT HE WANTS.
 NOBODY EVEN KNOWS HIS NAME.
BUT AS SOON
AS HE ARRIVES,
HE EXPECTS YOU TO BRING
THAT ESPRESSO.
 HE'LL DRINK IT
 IN THREE SIPS
 IN TOTAL SILENCE.
AND HE ALWAYS LEAVES
THE SAME TIP.
- ( clicks )
- ( ragtime music playing )
SOOTY, THIS ISN'T
YOUR USUAL
CHIMNEY SWEEPING
UNIFORM, IS IT?
NAH, 'CAUSE SOOTY IS NOT
A CHIMNEY SWEEPER.
SOOTY IS A "CHIMNIST."
AND I AM LOOKING
PARTICULARLY DELICIOUS TODAY
BECAUSE I WAS OFFICIATING
AT A WEDDING.
NOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT IT IS LUCKY
FOR A BRIDE
TO BE KISSED
ON BOTH CHEEKS
BY A CHIMNIST?
YEAH.SO WHAT LUCK DOES
THE TRASHMAN BRING?
I AM A SANITATION ENGINEER
 WHO ONE DAY WILL BE
 THE FIRST GARBAGE MAN
 TO GO OUT INTO SPACE.
WE GOT TO GET RID
OF SOME OF THIS TRASH
THAT'S AROUND HERE.
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE GONNA BE
A "TRASHTRONAUT."
- EXACTLY.
- SO WHAT?
YOU STUFF YOURSELF
INSIDE THE RUBBISH BIN
- AND, SHHH, SHOOT UP
INTO THE STRATOSPHERE?
- IT'LL HAPPEN.
YEAH, I READ ABOUT IT.
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
ANY DAY NOW.
THERE'S A LOT OF RUBBISH
IN THE FLOWER BUSINESS,
ISN'T THERE, RODDIE?
I HATE FLOWERS.
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT FLOWERS.
- TOUCHY TOUCHY.
- WHY?
MOMMY'S-- MOMMY'S
UPSETTING YOU?
 SAY HI TO MOMMY
 FOR ME, WILL YOU?
I FORGET.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW?
THERE'S, LIKE,
A TECHNICAL TERM FOR IT.
IT'S, UM...
IT'S WHORE.
- OOH!
- OOH!
I AM NOT
A FUCKING WHORE.
I'M A STIMULATOR.
( laughing )
 ( footsteps approaching )
 ( loud knocking )
TIME TO WAKE UP.
- JACQUES, PLEASE.
- TODAY'S A BIG DAY.
TODAY'S THE DAY I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE COFFEE.
- ( sighs ) MAKE COFFEE?
- YEAH.
I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG
ABOUT MY PERSON,
BUT I THINK THAT MAKING COFFEE
IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW SKILLS
THAT I ALREADY MASTERED.
( chuckling )
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
AND DUTY IS TO TRANSFER
THE FULL RANGE
OF FLAVOR AND AROMA
OF ENRIQUE'S BEANS
TO THE CUP.
ANYTHING LESS
WILL BE A DISGRACE
TO THE CUSTOMERS,
MY BAR, AND ENRIQUE.
IN ORDER TO SUCCEED,
YOU MUST MASTER
A FEW TECHNICAL SKILLS.
THE FIRST INSTRUMENT
IS THE GRINDER.
NOW COFFEE CAN BE
GROUND IN MANY WAYS,
BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
THE RIGHT WAY--
NEITHER TOO FINE
NOR TOO GRAINY.
WHEN THE WATER
IS A LITTLE OVER 90°
AND ALMOST BOILING,
IT IS FORCED THROUGH
THE COFFEE
AT A PRESSURE
OF NINE ATMOSPHERES.
AND THIS SHOULD TAKE
EXACTLY 24 SECONDS.
IF IT TAKES MORE
THAN 24 SECONDS,
THE COFFEE IS TOO FINE.
IF IT TAKES LESS
THAN 24 SECONDS,
THE COFFEE IS TOO GRAINY.
YOU CAN PRACTICE
USING THIS STOPWATCH.
BUT IN TIME YOU WILL COME
TO LEARN BY HEART
THE DURATION
OF THE MAGIC 24 SECONDS.
- ( clicks )
- ( machine hissing )
( clicks )
- ( sniffs )
- WHY DON'T YOU
EVEN TASTE THEM?
IT WOULD BE AN OFFENSE
TO MY TASTE BUDS.
YOU JUST DON'T EXPOSE THEM
TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WELL, I CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
- IT'S BLACK, IT'S HOT--
- IT'S DISGUSTING.
 ( cow moos, dog barking )
- THIS IS BUTRAGUEÑO...
- ( mooing )
 ...THE FAMOUS BULL.
 BUENOS DIAS, BUTRAGUEÑO,
YOU CRAZY CATHOLIC FUCK.
LUCKY BASTARD--
FUCKING THOSE
BEAUTIFUL COWS
ALL DAY LONG.
( snorting )
- ( cattle mooing )
- ( moaning )
( quacking )
( quacking )
WHY THE FUCK
DID YOU BUY A DUCK?
 IT'S OUR CHRISTMAS
 DINNER, LUCAS.
WE'RE GOING TO FEED IT
WITH ORANGES AND GINGER
AND FRESH ESTRAGON
AND COGNAC.
WE'RE GONNA MARINATE IT
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
- WE CAN'T KILL A FELLOW DUCK.
- YES, WE CAN, LUCAS.
MY MOUTH'S WATERING
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.
( barking )
 WHAT THE FUCK'S
 GOING ON HERE?
 ( piano music playing )
OKAY, YOU LET ME KNOW
HOW THIS ONE IS.
- HERE YOU ARE.
- THANK YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A SHAME
TO LET ALL THOSE
ESPRESSOS GO TO WASTE
WHILE I MASTER
THE TECHNIQUE,
SO I THOUGHT
WE COULD TAKE IT
AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO HELP PEOPLE.
- HELP PEOPLE?
- YES, HELP PEOPLE.
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?
 ( piano music stops )
WE'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS HERE,
NOT A GODDAMN SHELTER.
 NOW GET THESE LOSERS
 OUT OF MY SIGHT!
FINISH YOUR--
JACQUES...
AREN'T YOU SOMETIMES
AFRAID THAT YOU'LL GO
STRAIGHT TO HELL?
CHRISTOPHER, YOU CAN
FINISH YOUR COFFEE.
IT'S FINE.
GO!
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
THANK YOU.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
CALL YOU?
ESTRAGON?
- ( quacks )
- OKAY.
ESTRAGON.
BAR'S CLOSED.
GET THE FUCK OUT.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
THE OWNER OF THIS BUILDING.
- ( faucet stops )
- CORRECT.
WE'RE BUYING BUILDINGS
IN THIS AREA
AND WE'RE INTERESTED
IN LOOKING INTO BUYING
THIS ONE TOO.
WELL, FOR A BILLION DOLLARS
I'LL GIVE YOU A SCENIC TOUR
OF MY ANAL CANAL.
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THEM APPLES?
IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO SIT DOWN FOR A WHILE--
GODDAMN, YOU'RE LIKE
A PIECE OF SHIT THAT
JUST WON'T FLUSH.
NOW GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE BEFORE
I GET RUDE.
LET'S GO, GUYS.
"A WALK IN THE MISTS
OF TIME AND SPACE."
- WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S THE TITLE OF MY BOOK.
I LIKE IT.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO READING THAT.
YEAH, WELL,
I'M STUCK THOUGH.
I'M BLOCKED.
COME ON, YOU GOT IT
IN YOUR BLOOD.
YOU'RE JULES VERNE'S
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDSON.
- YEAH, BUT THINK
OF THE PRESSURE.
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
YOU COULD DO IT.
YOU GOT IT IN YOUR BLOOD.
- JUST WRITE IT.
- OKAY.
 ( piano music playing )
- ( quacking )
- SHE GAVE ME HER NUMBER,
BUT AS SHE WAS WRITING IT OUT,
SHE GOES, "DON'T CALL ME
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS."
AND I SAID, "HOW COME?"
SHE SAID, "WELL, I'M GONNA--"
AH, I CAN'T
TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
WE ARE ALL ANIMALS.
ESTRAGON, YOU MUST
BE LIBERATED.
- Roddie: TAKE IT EASY.
- COME ON, DARLING.
OUT OUT.
COME ON, OUT,
SWEETHEART.
- ( speaks German )
- ( quacking )
 ESTRAGON, MY FRIEND,
 YOU MUST BE LIBERATED.
- ( quacking )
- ( speaking German )
 I'M OFFERING YOU FREEDOM
 AND YOU GO BACK
 INTO INCARCERATION.
( silent )
PHIL.
- THIS ONE, RIGHT?
- YEAH, MM-HMM.
LISTEN, LUCAS, I DIDN'T
BRING TOO MUCH CASH WITH ME.
CAN I BRING IT IN
TO YOU TOMORROW?
I HAVE A TIP
I CAN LEAVE YA.
- YOU THINK IT'LL BE OKAY?
- YEAH, SURE.
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
HOW'S-- HOW'S
YOUR MOTHER DOING?
SHE'S DYING.
SHE MIGHT BE
ABLE TO COME HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL
A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK,
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT.
HERE'S TO MOOTY.
- MOOTY.
- HERE'S TO MOOTY.
MY BOY, YOU'RE MAKING
ONE VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE BEING FRIENDLY.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
- REMEMBER WHAT I SAY:
NEVER BE FRIENDLY
WITH A CUSTOMER.
BE FAMILIAR,
BUT NOT FRIENDLY.
THAT'S THE GOLDEN RULE:
FAMILIAR BUT NOT FRIENDLY.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH FRIENDLY?
SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU
LEAST EXPECT IT,
FRIENDSHIP WILL STAB YOU
IN THE BACK LIKE A DAGGER.
THE CUSTOMER WILL
START TRUSTING YOU,
YOU'LL START TRUSTING THEM.
ONE THING WILL LEAD
TO ANOTHER
AND YOU DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN.
CAN I GET ONE
FOR THE ROAD?
NO, SORRY, ROGER.
WE'RE CLOSED.
WAIT, JUST ONE
FOR THE ROAD.
COME ON.
I THINK YOU'VE HAD
SEVEN FOR THE ROAD.
- THIS ONE
IS FOR THE ROAD.
- WE'RE CLOSED.
DAMN IT.
OH, WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO HUMANITY THESE DAYS?
FUCK.
YOU'RE DOING
ALL RIGHT, LUCAS,
BUT YOU STILL GOT
A LOT TO LEARN.
WE GOTTA WORK
ON YOUR ATTITUDE.
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
A NATURAL WHEN IT COMES
TO HOSTILITY AND ARROGANCE.
BUT YOU KNOW,
GIVEN TIME IT'LL COME.
( farting )
( sighs )
IT'S AMAZING
HOW BROCCOLI ALWAYS
MAKES YOU FART.
IN A WAY, BROCCOLI
IS THE EMBODIMENT OF FART.
IF YOU COULD CAPTURE
A PIECE OF FART,
MATERIALIZE IT,
I IMAGINE IT WOULD LOOK
PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS.
THE INCARNATION OF FART.
( farts )
LUCAS, MY BOY...
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
( chuckling )
HI.
THE BAR IS CLOSED.
( crying )
OH...
HEY, DON'T CRY.
DON'T CRY.
UH, EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.
HERE, HAVE A SEAT.
LET ME GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?
- CHAMPAGNE.
- CHAMPAGNE?
- YES, PLEASE.
- HERE.
- THANK YOU.
MM.
- ARE YOU A STEWARDESS?
- NO.
OH.
I JUST THOUGHT BECAUSE
OF THE OUTFIT...
- I GOT FIRED.
- WHY?
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID.
AFRAID OF WHAT?
I WAS AFRAID OF FLYING.
WELL, IT'S NOT
IN OUR NATURE TO FLY.
SO I DON'T BLAME YOU.
YOU ARE VERY KIND.
CAN I STAY
WITH YOU TONIGHT?
YOU MEAN LIKE--
I HAVE NO PLACE TO SLEEP
AND I'M VERY TIRED.
UM...
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
MAYBE NOT THE BEST IDEA.
- ( crying )
- OH, NO NO.
PLEASE, I AM SORRY.
I AM SORRY.
 DON'T CRY.
BUT WE HAVE TO BE
VERY QUIET
AND VERY VERY
CAREFUL.
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- I LIVE HERE.
WOW.
MY BOSS
LIVES HERE TOO
AND HE'S NOT
THE KIND OF PERSON
YOU'D LIKE TO WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
- I UNDERSTAND.
- ( pan clanging )
I'M SORRY.
- ( snoring )
- Man: You will be
  at peace with yourself
 and the people
 around you.
 I am going to wake you up
 at the count of five.
 One--
 you feel yourself
 awakening now,
 filled with energy
 and self-assurance.
 Two-- you are
 feeling good
 and glad to be alive.
 Three-- you are
 awakening now, feeling...
GOOD MORNING, JACQUES.
THIS IS APRIL.
SHE HAD NO PLACE TO STAY
AND NO MONEY, SO--
I WANT THAT WHORE
OUT OF MY HOUSE IMMEDIATELY
AND I NEVER WANT
TO SEE HER AGAIN.
 ( door slams )
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT
HE JUST CALLED ME?
- YES.
 ( water running )
CHAMPAGNE IS NOT
FOR WETTING PUSSIES,
YOU KNOW.
IT'S FOR CELEBRATING
MAJOR VICTORIES IN SPORTS.
( sighs )
LISTEN TO ME.
THERE ARE TWO WORLDS--
THE WORLD OF MAN
AND THE WORLD OF THE BITCH.
A BAR IS NO PLACE
FOR A WOMAN.
THEY HAVE THE CAFETERIAS
AND THE PATISSERIES.
THE BAR IS OUR SPACE.
IT'S A SANCTUARY WHERE MAN
CAN COME AND BE FREE
KNOWING THAT HE'S
PERFECTLY PROTECTED
FROM ANY INTERFERENCE
OF THE FEMININE.
BUT SHE'S GOT NO MONEY
AND NO PLACE TO STAY.
WELL, THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM
AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T MINE.
- WE CAN'T JUST THROW HER OUT
ON THE STREET LIKE GARBAGE.
- YES, WE CAN.
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE?
OH, JESUS CHRIST, LUCAS.
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
I AM JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL!
WE GOT EVERYTHING.
SHE'S GOT NOTHING.
WE CAN HELP HER.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
24 HOURS.
 YOU'VE GOT 24 HOURS
 TO GET RID OF THE BITCH.
 ( door opens, slams )
( tires screeching )
SO HOW ARE YOU
FEELING THESE DAYS?
DOUBT, FEAR,
PAIN, ANXIETY,
DISTRACTION,
NERVOUSNESS,
HORROR, FRIGHT,
PANIC, DREAD,
TERROR, TREPIDATION.
I FEEL LIKE
A GODDAMN THESAURUS.
COME ON, ESTRAGON,
EAT THOSE HERBS.
THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOU.
LOOKS GOOD.
WHERE IS YOUR LADY ROOM?
NO LADY ROOM.
 ( Jacques chuckles )
 ( door slams )
ESTRAGON?
WHERE'S ESTRAGON?
 ( quacking )
 ESTRAGON!
( quacking continues )
COME ON.
SHH.
- April: I LOVE FLOWERS.
- Roddie: YEAH?  YOU SHOULD
  COME BY SOMETIME.
- April: YES.
- Roddie: YEAH.
YOU NEED A LIGHTER?
IT APPEARS OUR BOY RODDIE
IS HAVING A HARD TIME
GETTING HIS FLAME UP.
WOMEN CAN SEEM CUTE
AND CHARMING ON THE SURFACE.
BUT UNDERNEATH
THEY'RE THE SAME
UNIVERSAL BITCH.
YEAH, FUCK YOU.
YOU LITTLE SISSY-BOY, HUH?
- FUCK YOU!
YOU COME AND YOU WHINE!
- WHOA WHOA WHOA.
( all shouting )
- COME ON, FLOWER BOY!
- DAMN IT, YOU FUCKING WHORE.
I'M NOT A WHORE!
I'M A STIMULATOR!
( buzzing, dings )
LUCAS.
 COME OVER HERE
 FOR A SECOND.
I'VE GOT A THERAPY
CLASS AT 9:30.
AND WHEN I GET BACK,
SHE'S HISTORY, OKAY?
 ( door opens, closes )
- APRIL.
- YES?
I WAS THINKING
IT'S BEEN NICE
HAVING YOU
AND EVERYTHING.
OH, THANK YOU.
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.
IS THAT ALL
YOU WANTED TO SAY?
YES.
I GUESS SO.
BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU WANT TO
TELL ME SOMETHING--
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.
HERE.
TAKE THIS MONEY.
 IT'S A BIT FROZEN
 AT THE MOMENT.
BUT WHEN IT MELTS,
IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO GET YOU BACK.
I'M SORRY.
 ( door slams )
Man:
 TAKE A NICE DEEP BREATH
 AND GO TO THE CENTER
 AND LET IT OUT.
All:
WHOOOA!
- THEN GO BACK.  OOH.
- ( men sighing )
* HA HA HO HO HO 
- All: * HA HA HO HO HO 
- ( clapping )
* HA HA HO HO HO,
HA HA HO HO HO *
* HA HA HO HO HO,
HA HA HO HO HO... *
( all squawking )
BAD GUY.
( all laughing maniacally )
 ( door opens, closes )
LET'S GET MARRIED.
- MARRIED?
- YES.
BUT WOULDN'T WE BE MOVING
A LITTLE BIT FAST?
YES.
PLEASE, LUCAS,
DON'T SEND ME BACK.
PLEASE PLEASE.
( chuckling )
THIS IS A BIG RELIEF
FOR ME, LUCAS.
 YOU KNOW, THE BITCH EPISODE
 WAS NOT SUCH A BAD THING.
 IT MADE
 THE ALARM BELLS RING
AND IT ALLOWS US
TO BE MORE ALERT FROM...
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
 DID SOMEBODY
 WIN SOMETHING?
DID I MISS SOMETHING
IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS?
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON, LUCAS?
I'M GETTING MARRIED.
LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT:
 I ASK YOU TO
 KICK OUT THE BITCH
 AND I LEAVE YOU ALONE
 FOR SIX QUARTERS OF AN HOUR.
AND WHEN I GET BACK,
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
TO THE BITCH?
WOULD THAT BE
A FAIRLY ACCURATE ACCOUNT
OF THE EVENTS?
I GUESS SO.
 DO I HAVE TO WATCH
 YOUR EVERY FUCKING STEP?
THIS IS MY WORSE NIGHTMARE
COME TRUE.FUCK!
 I SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE CAREFUL.
 I SHOULD'VE PREVENTED THIS.
 JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
STICK TO OUR PLAN?
WHAT PLAN?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ENRIQUE'S DAUGHTER?
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH HER.
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
YOU WERE GONNA MARRY HER.
YOU'RE CRAZY.
SHE'S NINE YEARS OLD.
I NEVER SAID THAT.
WE MADE A DEAL,
YOU UNGRATEFUL SON OF A BITCH.
I PUT ALL MY BETS
ON YOU, LUCAS.
 JESUS, MY WORLD
 IS FALLING APART.
YOU'RE CRAZY.
I WORK LIKE A SLEDGEHAMMER
IN HELL FOR YOUR FUCKING BAR.
YOU KEEP ME HERE
LIKE A PRISONER.
 IF SHE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
 FOR THIS PLACE, THEN I'M
 OUT OF HERE TOO.
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- YES, I CAN.
- NO, YOU CAN'T.
- YES, I CAN.
JUST TAKE A LOOK,
JACQUES.
I'LL GET IT FRESH.
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.
PSST.
( "Happy Birthday" playing )
Men:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACQUES!
( laughter )
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
- Men: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
- I DON'T DO BIRTHDAYS.
- WE BAKED THE CAKE FOR YOU.
 I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
 WHAT YOU BAKED.
YOU CAN TAKE THAT AND GET IT
OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!HEAR HEAR!
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACQUES.
LISTEN, YOU FUCKING BUNCH
OF "ANIMALOGICAL" FREAKS,
I DON'T WANT
A FUCKING BIRTHDAY CAKE
AND I DON'T WANT
A FUCKING BIRTHDAY!
SO TAKE THIS FUCKING THING
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
- ( voices overlapping )
- JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
GET THE FUCK OUT!
- ( Rococo barking )
- OUT OUT!ALL OF YOU, NOW.
GO!DO YOU HEAR ME?
GET THE FUCK OUT!
DON'T ANY OF YOU
FUCKING UNDERSTAND
FUCKING ENGLISH?
- GO, FUCK OUT!
- FUCKING CRAZY.
I TOLD YOU SCHMUCKS,
I DON'T DO BIRTHDAYS, OKAY?
NOW YOU'RE BANNED,
ALL OF YOU, FOR A WEEK!
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- FOR A FUCKING CAKE.
FOR A FUCKING CAKE
HE BANS US.
 ( piano music playing )
OKAY.
I'M-- I'M WILLING
TO COMPROMISE,
ALTHOUGH I HATE
COMPROMISE
MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE WORLD.
BUT WHAT ELSE
CAN I DO?
YOU STABBED ME
IN THE BACK, LUCAS.
YOU'RE KICKING ME
WHEN I'M LYING DOWN
AND IN NO POSITION
TO DEFEND MYSELF.
I WAS BEGINNING
TO LIKE YOU, LUCAS.
I MADE THE FATAL MISTAKE
OF TRUSTING YOU.
 WHAT DO I GET?
 BAFF.
AS SOON AS I SHOW
A TINY SPOT OF
VULNERABILITY,
YOU ATTACK ME.
YOU'RE A TRAITOR, LUCAS--
A FUCKING TRAITOR.
AND NOW I'M LYING HERE
CLOSER TO DEATH THAN
EVER BEFORE
AND FROM THAT
HOPELESS POSITION
I HAVE TO NEGOTIATE.
OKAY, THE BITCH CAN STAY.
 I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT,
 BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.
I HAVE TO KEEP
THE BUSINESS GOING.
AND IF THIS IS THE PRICE,
THEN THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.
IF YOU REALLY HAVE IT IN YOU
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF MY HOPELESS CONDITION,
THEN GO AHEAD.
BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME
BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.
( click )
 ( car horns honking )
 ( sirens blaring )
 ( jazz music playing )
THANK YOU.
IT SHOULDN'T COME
AS A SURPRISE
THAT YOUR HEART IS CLOSE
TO USELESS BY NOW.
SO WHAT I'M INTERESTED
IN DOING IS PUTTING YOU
ON A WAITING LIST
FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT.
WHOA WHOA WHOA.
WAITING LIST?
SOUNDS BAD.
I HATE WAITING.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.
THERE'S A REASON
WE CALL YOU A PATIENT
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.
HA HA HA.
VERY FUNNY.
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE
WOULD REALLY HELP A LOT
WITH GETTING YOU THROUGH
ALL THIS WAITING.
AND IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE
YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVING
A TRANSPLANT.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
YOU HAVE TO LIVE
A HEALTHY LIFE.
OKAY?
YOU CAN NEVER DRINK
OR SMOKE AGAIN.
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, DOC,
SEND ME BACK TO KINDERGARTEN?
YOU GOTTA REALIZE
I'M A DIRTY OLD BASTARD
WITH FILTHY HABITS.
A NEW HEART
IS A PRECIOUS GIFT
AND WE ONLY
GIVE THEM TO THOSE
WHO ARE GOING
TO TREAT THEIR GIFT
WITH RESPECT AND CARE.
I DON'T LIKE THE PATRONIZING
TONE OF YOUR VOICE.
TO BE FRANK, I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE AT ALL.
SOMEONE IS GONNA DIE
SO YOU CAN LIVE.
DO YOU GET THAT?
YEAH, I GET IT.
- NOW DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT
YOU ON THE LIST OR NOT?
- YES, PLEASE.
- AND YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IMPLIES?
- YES, DOC.
( labored breathing )
JACQUES, YOU OKAY?
HERE.
TAKE A LOOK.
THE DOCTOR GAVE ME
THIS PHONE.
HE'S THE ONLY
PERSON ON EARTH
WHO HAS THIS NUMBER.
WHEN IT RINGS IT CAN
ONLY MEAN ONE THING:
THAT A NEW HEART
HAS ARRIVED.
SO WHEN
THE CALL COMES,
I HAVE TO BE
AT THE HOSPITAL
WITHIN 20 MINUTES.
THAT MEANS
I MUST BE READY
AT ALL TIMES--
THE SUITCASE PACKED,
READY TO GO.
( snaps fingers )
JUST LIKE THAT.
 ( Muzak playing )
HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
( huffing )
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
JACQUES, LET ME EXPLAIN.
JACQUES, I'M SORRY.
JACQUES, I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU...
WE JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR BUSINESS
TO INCORPORATE
THE DINING HALL.
WE CAN EASILY MANAGE IT
NOW THAT WE ARE THREE.
YOU HAVE NOT
UNDERSTOOD A THING.
THIS IS NOT A CAFE.
THIS IS NOT A RESTAURANT.
THIS IS NOT A BISTRO,
NOR IS THIS A BRASSERIE.
THIS IS A BAR.
AND BY DEFINITION,
THE CAPACITY OF A BAR
CANNOT EXCEED 13 PEOPLE.
- THINK JESUS
AND HIS APOSTLES.
- I'M SORRY.
LUCAS, YOU MUST
CONTROL THAT BITCH.
JUST KEEP HER
OUT OF MY FACE.
- SO HOW WAS YOUR
DATE LAST NIGHT?
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
I CAN'T GET ANYTHING GOING.
I-- I CAN'T EVEN...
IT'S HARD ENOUGH
MEETING WOMEN.
COME ON, RODDIE,
YOU OWN A FLOWER SHOP,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
THAT'S A PRIME
POSITION TO BE IN.
NO, SEE, 
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT.
IT DOESN'T WORK
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE COMING
INTO THE SHOP-- WOMEN--
THEY'RE BUYING FLOWERS
FOR EITHER THEIR BOYFRIENDS
OR THEIR HUSBANDS.
SO, YOU KNOW,
ME HITTING ON THEM
WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT
IS JUST RIDICULOUS.
AND THEN WHEN
I DO GO ON A DATE
AND I BRING THEM FLOWERS
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY KNOW
THAT I OWN A FLOWER SHOP,
ANYTHING I BRING THEM
IS JUST NOT IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.
FORGET THE FUCKING FLOWERS,
ALL RIGHT?
YOU'VE GOTTA FIND
A NEW GROOVE.
Roddie:
 YEAH, IT'S EASY
 FOR YOU TO SAY.
- YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL.
- JUST TALK TO HER, RODDIE.
APRIL...
( clears throat )
UH, WHAT DO YOU
USUALLY DO AFTER WORK?
( laughing )
SHE'S SURE GOT
THE BITCH ELEMENT
DOWN TO A SCIENCE.
YOU SHOULD BE TAKING
NOTES HERE, LUCAS.
 YOU NEED TO BE MORE
 OF A BITCH YOURSELF.
 YOU'RE TOO NICE.
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE TO SAVE PEOPLE;
WE'RE HERE
TO DESTROY THEM.
 SCHNEKE, I BELIEVE
YOU HAVESOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ME.
- WHAT IS IT?
- MY BREATH.
YOU TOOK IT AWAY.
- ( April giggles )
- I CAN'T BREATHE
  WHEN I SEE YOU.
MY HEART STARTS TO RACE.
CAN YOU FEEL IT
GO PITTER-PATTER?
- I WAS JUST
TALKING TO HER!
- GET OUT.
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
AND DON'T COME BACK.
ROGER.
WHERE'S APRIL?
SHE LEFT.
THE BAR IS NO PLACE
FOR A WOMAN--
YOU WERE RIGHT
ON THAT ONE.
APRIL WAS MORE OF A MAN
THAN MOST OF THE SISSIES
THAT HANG AROUND HERE.
SO YOU LIKED HER?
I DIDN'T COMPLETELY
DISLIKE HER.
LUCAS, GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.
- WHERE'S APRIL?
- SHE'S GONE.
IT'S A DAMN SHAME.
THERE USED TO BE
SPARKS AROUND HER.
Roddie:
PSSH, YOU GOT
THAT RIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HEY, WHOA.
THERE'S SOME
SPARKS FOR YOU.
HERE'S TO YOU MORONS.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.
 ( door opens )
LEAVE ME ALONE, JACQUES.
LET'S GO FOR A SPIN,
LEAVE THIS CITY FOR A WHILE.
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- YOU LOOK MISERABLE.
 YOU NEED TO CHEER UP.
A JUNKYARD?
HOW UPLIFTING.
YOU'RE WASTING
MY TIME, JACQUES.
- ( clunking )
- ( chuckles )
Jacques:
 I ALWAYS DREAMED
 OF DOING THIS.
LIFE'S TOO SHORT
FOR LOUSY CARS.
- ( chatter )
- ( piano music playing )
 ( cell phone ringing )
( room falls silent )
 ( monitor beeping )
( engine revving )
JACQUES, I'M VERY SORRY.
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.
NO HEART?
NO, WE GOT THE HEART,
BUT IT WAS NO GOOD.
IT HAPPENS VERY RARELY,
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.
THE HEART WAS NO GOOD.
YOU MEAN YOU SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME
FOR NOTHING?
 I SHIT MY PANTS
 BECAUSE OF THIS.
- ( gasping )
- ( beeping quickens )
- Nurse: HEART RATE: 140.
- OKAY, CHECK HIS
BLOOD PRESSURE.
- ( gasps )
- JACQUES, CAN YOU BREATHE?
- CAN YOU BREATHE DEEPLY?
TAKE DEEP BREATHS.
- ( sighs )
BLOOD PRESSURE
HAS FALLEN TO 70/40.
LET'S GIVE HIM 2mg
OF METOPROLOL, I.V.
JACQUES, LISTEN TO ME.
CAN YOU LIFT YOUR HEAD?
- CAN YOU LIFT YOUR HEAD?
- ( grunts )
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO KEEP YOU HERE.
HERE YOU GO.
- WHAT IS THIS?
- WELL, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
A FUCKING HAMSTER?
HEY.
I DON'T THINK
WE'VE BEEN INTRODUCED.
MY NAME'S BEN.
I'M YOUR NEW ROOMMATE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
JACQUES.
WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU?
- O.
- O'S GOOD.
- NO THREAT IN O.
- WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU?
- FUCKIN' "A."
- ( chuckles )
 * CHRISTMAS BELLS 
 * CHRISTMAS BELLS 
 * RINGING LOUD AND STRONG 
 * FOLLOW THEM 
 * FOLLOW THEM 
 * YOU'VE BEEN AWAY
 TOO LONG *
 * THERE IS NO CHRISTMAS 
 * LIKE A HOME CHRISTMAS 
 * THAT'S THE TIME OF YEAR *
 * ALL ROADS LEAD HOME. 
Jacques:
 THROUGHOUT THESE EXHAUSTING
 MONTHS OF DOUBT AND PAIN,
MY ONLY CONSOLATION
HAS BEEN VISUALIZING
THAT DUCK
SERVED ON A PLATE.
( quacking )
HANG ON THERE, LUCAS.
 LOWER THE BLADE
 FOR A SEC.
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHAT WOULD
YOU BUDDHA PEOPLE EAT?
 SAY DURING
 THE FESTIVAL OF VESAK.
DUCK, PERSONALLY.
I THOUGHT BUDDHISM
AND VEGETARIANISM
WENT HAND IN HAND.
I MEAN, THE FIRST
PRECEPT OF BUDDHISM
IS TO AVOID KILLING
OR HARMING ANY LIVING BEING.
SO HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THAT
WITH EATING MEAT?
ACTUALLY,
THE BUDDHA HIMSELF ATE MEAT
 AND WAS THEREFORE
 NOT A VEGETARIAN.
IN FACT, IT IS THOUGHT THAT
HE DIED FROM FOOD POISONING
AFTER EATING ROTTEN PORK.
 HOWEVER,
 HE ADVISED THAT MEAT
 SHOULD ONLY BE EATEN
WHEN IT WAS NOT SEEN,
HEARD, OR SUSPECTED
THAT THE ANIMAL
HAD BEEN KILLED
SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE PURPOSE OF EATING.
 LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES
 TO DEATH HERE.
I MEAN, THE MEAT YOU EAT
IS OBVIOUSLY FROM ANIMALS
BUTCHERED FOR
THE PURPOSE OF EATING.
SO YOU'RE BREAKING
THE FIRST PRECEPT WITH
EVERY BITE YOU CHEW.
AS I SEE IT,
I'M NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED
IN THE KILLING
OF THE ANIMAL.
OH.
SO YOU FOUND THE MEAT
AT THE BUTCHER'S.
 YOU DIDN'T SEE
 NO ANIMAL BEING KILLED
AND YOU DON'T SUSPECT
THAT THE BUTCHER
KILLED AN ANIMAL
FOR THE PURPOSE OF EATING.
KIND OF.
YOU BUDDHA MONKEYS
REALLY OUGHT TO GET
YOUR STORY STRAIGHT.
- THIS IS FUCKING NONSENSE.
- CAN I KILL IT NOW?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
 I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
 EATING AN ANIMAL TONIGHT.
CAN'T YOU PREPARE
SOMETHING WITHOUT A FACE?
LIKE AN OCTOPUS
OR SOMETHING?
 ( door opens, closes )
- YOU'RE BECOMING
A SISSY, JACQUES.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
I'VE BECOME ALL SENSITIVE
AND SENTIMENTAL LATELY.
Jacques:
 WOW, THAT LOOKS WONDERFUL.
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.
- MERRY CHRISTMAS, JACQUES.
WILL I SEE YOU
TOMORROW?
NO, I'M ONLY ALLOWED OUT
FOR CHRISTMAS.
I HAVE TO BE BACK
AT THE HOSPITAL
BY MIDNIGHT.
HAH, LIKE CINDERELLA.
( chuckles )
 ( hip-hop music playing )
YOU KNOW, TONIGHT
I'VE BEEN GIVING
LOTS OF THOUGHT
TO SOMETHING.
WHAT IS IT, JACQUES?
LET'S SELL THE BAR.
SELL IT?
WHY?
WELL, AS YOU INTELLIGENTLY
POINTED OUT EARLIER,
I HAVE BECOME A BIT
OF A SISSY LATELY.
WELL, I WAS
ONLY JOKING, JACQUES.
- DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
- NO NO, BUT IT'S TRUE.
SINCE I GOT
THE FALSE HEART,
SOMETHING CHANGED IN ME.
I BECAME A SISSY.
IT'S JUST
A TEMPORARY THING,
YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE A BIT WEAK
AT THE MOMENT.
YOU'LL BE BACK
ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME,
INSULTING PEOPLE
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW.
WELL, THANKS FOR
THE ENCOURAGEMENT,
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE.
YOU SEE, LUCAS...
I'VE WITNESSED
A CHANGE IN YOU TOO.
 I MEAN,
 YOU USED TO BE
 SO OPEN-HEARTED
 AND KIND--
HOPELESSLY KIND
WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS TYPE OF WORK.
BUT SINCE APRIL LEFT,
 YOU'VE BECOME
 BITTER AND COLD,
 AGGRESSIVE EVEN.
AND...
IT JUST MAKES ME SAD.
DON'T BE SAD, JACQUES.
IT'S MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,
YOU KNOW.
 BUT IT'S A FAILED
 MISSION, LUCAS.
I DON'T WISH FOR YOU
TO COPY MY FATE.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BECOME
BITTER AND COLD.
 LIFE'S TOO SHORT
 FOR THAT.
I THINK WE SHOULD
THROW IN THE TOWEL,
LOOK OURSELVES IN THE EYES,
AND ADMIT THAT WE FAILED.
 LET'S GET RID
 OF THE FUCKIN' PLACE.
 WE'LL SPLIT IT 50/50.
I WANT TO SPEND
THE LAST DAYS OF MY LIFE
IN A BETTER PLACE
THAN THIS SHITHOLE.
YOU GO AHEAD,
BUT I DON'T WANT ANY OF IT.
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.
I CAME HERE TO HELP.
AND I'M SORRY
THAT I LET YOU DOWN--
YOU AND APRIL.
NO.
YOU OWN HALF OF EVERYTHING
 AND THE REMAINING HALF
 GOES TO ENRIQUE
 AND JOSEPHINE.
 ( motor whirring )
YOU'RE BACK.
YOU'RE BACK.
 ( piano music playing )
( quacks )
AH, THIS IS
A FANTASTIC CHOICE.
HERE IS TO
"AVRIL" THE GREAT.
Man:
 HEY, LUCAS.
 ( muffled dance music
 playing )
- ( harmonica music playing )
- ( ping-pong ball clacking )
( harmonica music continues )
I THINK I NEED TO GO
BACK TO MY ROOM.
OKAY.
CAN YOU DEFINE THE PAIN
ON A SCALE OF 0-10?
- HOW'S HIS PAIN
PRESENTING?
- Nurse: 10.
- RESPIRATION?
- LABORED.
LET'S GIVE HIM
.25 NITROGLYCERIN
AND 5mg OF MORPHINE.
 ( monitor beeping )
( quacking )
- Man: LUCAS.
- YEAH, I'M COMING.
I'M COMING.
- WANT CHAMPAGNE?
- YES, PLEASE.
- Lucas: ESTRAGON?
ESTRAGON?
- ( quacks )
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
 OH!
( honks )
