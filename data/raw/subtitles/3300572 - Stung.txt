- Fuck!
- Can we turn this down?
- I mean...
I only wanna little bit
of music.
How do you do that?
- Do what?
- Read in the car.
I get carsick as shit, you know?
Start getting all queasy,
burps start smelling weird.
And I'm puking projectile vomit.
It'll be violent.
You know what I mean?
Like, urgh-urgh.
Like, I'm eating it back
into my mouth. Can't see.
It splatters everywhere.
Little piece gets in your eye.
You're like, "Ah!"
So you open your mouth.
And it gets in your mouth
and then...
You're gagging, you're vomiting
all over the place.
And I crash into a tree.
- Could you please stop?
I'm... I'm gonna finish working
on my checklist, you know.
Did you bring the wine glasses?
- Yeah. Hmm.
- Uh, I'm gonna double-check.
- Whoa. It's okay.
- Really? Really?
- We're okay. Let me help.
There's a towel around here.
- No. It's everywhere.
Who paved this fucking road?
- Is that
a rhetorical question?
- Would you do try not to hit,
you know
all the potholes
and/or gardeners?
- You seem a little anxious.
- I am. I mean, I'm running
this business now.
If I fail the business fails.
If the business fails,
then I don't make money.
And If can't make money,
I can't pay you. You know?
It's all I know how to do is parties
and if I can't do parties then
what... what does
that say about me?
- I mean... I mean, I...
It's, uh...
I don't know. I mean, it sounds
like you were born to party.
I mean, not like, you... party,
but like party, like cater.
You were born to cater,
you know?
Do you smoke weed?
I think weed would be great.
- If I was a doctor...
- Paul.
- Yeah.
- Just stop.
Just stop.
- Really? I thought maybe
we were communicating there.
So, I'm, uh...
Yeah. No.
- Phone.
- What?
Look, I'm not a child.
I know not to use my phone
while I work.
Why do I have to give it to you?
- I don't want the guests
seeing you searching
for a signal like an idiot.
- There is no winning with you.
Yeah.
- Careful!
- I know, I know.
- Please don't fuck this up.
This year's been hard enough
as it is.
- I know. I know.
Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I mean... No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be perfect.
Wow.
This place is a piece of shit.
- You'll see it has its charms.
You're not gonna wear
that shirt, are you?
- Everything's gonna be okay.
Alright? Just relax.
- Flora!
Como estas?
- Julia! Darling.
-  So good to see you.
-  Ah.
- Sounds alright to you?
- Sounds damn good to me.
- I'm Lawrence.
Tonight's entertainment.
Friends call me Larry.
- Bartender Paul.
Friends call me Paul.
- Well, Paul, you seem awfully
glum on such a fine afternoon.
There's something I can play
to cheer up your spirits?
- I don't... I don't know,
why don't you surprise me?
Do you know anything
in the key of G?
- G like Greats?
- G like Great. That's funny.
Clever. Larry.
- Paul.
- Yeah.
- You'd think I'd outgrow
the onion cries, right?
Dad was always on chopping duty.
- I heard about your father.
I'm sorry, Julia.
- It's been tough, I'm just...
trying to hold
everything together.
- Uh... But you're just as good
at he was. Better, even.
Everything will work out.
- Oh, God.
Come on.
Jesus.
Fuck.
- He likes you.
- Yeah.
No.
I'm pretty sure I'd rather
jump off a cliff.
- Hey, there.
Put you in charge, huh?
- Uh. Yeah.
- Okay.
You got much experience?
- Sure. Yeah. I'm good
at serving drinks.
I'm good at consuming alcohol
so really I'm over-qualified
for the job.
- Umm, yeah, well, uh,
that's my personal stash.
So, uh, if you can
just keep them cold in a...
You know, don't give them out.
You put open bar
on these flyers
and people come running down
from the hills.
These, uh, cocksuckers
are expensive.
- Yeah, I'll keep them safe
for you, sir.
- You don't have to call me
"sir." I'm... I'm Sydney Perch.
- Paul.
- Yeah. Nice, Paul.
- Um, heh...
You wanna have a beer with me?
That's totally cool, just don't,
uh, you know, tell my mom.
- I really should wait
till I'm off the clock.
I'm gonna get you started.
There you go.
- Sydney.
Is little Percy down there?
He's run off again!
- I'd better go get him.
Uh, put that on ice, okay.
- Weird.
Fuck.
Ow!
Goddammit!
Jesus.
You see, you see that?
They're like this...
There fucking huge.
Avoid everything here.
It's... it's bad.
- Oh, poor baby.
I brought this for you.
I thought you might forget that.
Don't put it through your hand.
- I'm not gonna put it
through my hand.
Ow! Kidding.
Can you do me a favor? Can you just
warn that guy about the wasps?
They're just... I don't know.
They're really
making me nervous.
Cause if he's... if he's
allergic...
- Sydney?
- Yeah.
The guy with the Quasimodo.
- Was he drunk?
- Um...
I mean, I gave him a beer.
So it depends
what his tolerance is.
I mean, he did suck it down
pretty good.
- Just remember
these are our clients.
- Yeah. Aye, aye captain.
Why do I... It's not the fucking
White House, okay?
I mean, her husband was in
the pharmaceutical business.
Some corporate drug dealer.
They medicate the American
population into fucking zombies.
Alright? I don't need
to respect that.
- You should respect the fact
that we're doing a job.
- Yes, you're right.
Fuck.
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah, it is terrible.
Do you wanna kiss it
and make it better?
- First aid's in
the glove compartment.
Okay. Next to that is a spare
pair of pants.
You should put them on,
one leg at a time.
Alright? And while you're
at it...
move the van
to the back of the house.
Guests arrive in 25 minutes so,
chop-chop!
- Hey, Paul, I noticed that you
put up all these lights.
Climbed that tree, huh?
'Cause I know that I didn't get
you a ladder.
Looks really nice. I'm really
happy that you're here
and you're helping me.
Look good.
Jesus...
Ooh.
Oh, my God.
Little guy, you scared
the shit out of me.
- Percy.
- Oh. Huh.
Ugh, excuse me, Hi. Ms. Perch?
I'm sorry, I just, I couldn't
help but admire your garden.
It's beautiful.
- You're the boy they've sent
to tend bar.
- It's Paul. Um...
- You remind me a bit
of my late husband.
He was very fetching.
Oh, why, I do believe I hear
some guests arriving.
- Well, I better
get back to it.
- Come along, Percy.
Come along.
- Yes, little boy. Come on.
Here we go.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
- Hi. What can I get you?
- We'll have two reds.
- Alright, coming right up.
- You two newlyweds?
- Thank you.
- Would you like some?
- No. Thank you.
- Hello.
Enjoy.
- It'll ruin my scotch.
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?
Uh, what can I get you?
- Gin, with a splash
of flat water, please.
- That's a first for the night.
- You enjoying
the party so far?
- I am. I am.
-  So, how do you know
the family?
- Oh, we are friends of them,
my husband and I.
- Oh, your husband?
- Almost divorced.
- That's... that's sad.
- You know.
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
Reminds me of a joke, uh...
- Let's save the punch line
for later. Okay?
- Okay.
Alright. Heh.
Anyway...
- Having all the fun here
in cougar town, huh?
No, but seriously,
do you need anything?
- No, it's fine. I'm fine.
Everything's good, actually.
- Hey, Mr. Mayor.
Uh, everything, okay?
- Yes.
And this party needs an autopsy.
Oh yeah, give me a double.
No ice.
Who's responsible for these
little piggy thingies?
- This young lady right here...
What did I tell you?
It's, I, excuse my language
the best fucking piggy thingies
I've ever had in my life.
- Does everything taste okay?
- Oh, they're delicious.
-  Oh.
- Yeah.
- Do you have a card?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm gonna need
someone for my...
re-election party next month.
Thank you. I'll call you.
- Oh, we're keeping our
fingers crossed.
-  For you.
- Oh.
- You two make a good pair.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Wow.
- Hi, Ladies.
Have you tasted this?
They have a whole tray
of them up there.
- Oh, my God.
Uh, this is disgusting.
Argh.
Hey, man, you should really
watch out.
These fucking things are everywhere.
They're really fucking nasty.
Just in case you're allergic
or whatever.
- You know
what I'm allergic to?
- What?
- You bumming me out.
Care for a little relief?
I have a prescription
from Dr. Greenthumb.
Sweet party, dude.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's not bad.
They're super rich,
these people.
So if you just keep your
head down, you know, they...
I guess they tip well.
That's what Julia says.
- Julie, Julie. She's a hottie
with a body, huh?
Uh, she's not, um...
she doesn't happen to be
available, does she?
- I don't...
I haven't asked her.
- I totally get it, man!
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I'll have whatever
you're making.
I like the way you
hold that bottle.
- Thank you. That guy
was really creepy.
- He looks like
Ulysses S. Grant.
- Thanks for the invite.
- What?
- Uh...
Well, mother and I are... are
certainly delighted
you could... all be here this
evening to, uh, remember dad.
These gatherings have, uh...
certainly become a tradition
throughout the years.
- Sorry, I didn't think
you'd be so cool about it.
- Yeah, well, you mean
everyone can
smell it on you, so...
- Sorry.
-  And so, uh, everybody
enjoy themselves
and have a great time.
And... and stay as long
as you'd like.
And, uh...
um, uh...
yeah.
- Yeah.
- Thank you all for coming.
And for leaving
the kids at home.
- Really.
- It was funny.
- Oh, fucking shit...
- You see that?
- Help!
Oh, God, help him!
- I think something bit him!
-  No, no.
I couldn't possibly...
- You're a doctor! Help him!
- I'm a gynecologist
for Christ's sake!
- What the hell is happening?
- Oh, God, get away from him!
- I got a cold compress!
Oh, my God! Alright,
alright. Watch out!
Somebody call 911!
For fuck's sake!
Can you help me with this, sir?
- Yeah, I'll do the best I can.
- Roll him onto the cloth.
- One, two, tree.
- Oh.
- Everybody get
inside right now!
- Get off. Get off me!
Leave me! Leave me!
Leave me alone!
Don't. Don't. No...
- Shh, shh, shh...
Ugh-ugh.
Jesus.
- We're taking the party
inside, mother.
- Come on, home...
- Oh my God! What's happening?
- Shit! Come on, come on.
Goddamn it!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- What the f...
- Oh, God.
- J-J-Julia... Julia! Julia!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my...
Oh, my God.
- Hey!
Get the fuck off him!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!
- Are you okay...
- No, no, no...
- I'm going to find...
- You two! Julia! Come one!
Get in here!
Come on!
- Let's go.
- Guys, everyone is in
the kitchen. Let's go!
- Come on!
- Argh!
What the hell just happened?
Argh!
You made it.
- I feel sick, Flora.
- No, no. Mrs. Perch, you're
okay. Everything's okay.
- What are we gonna do now?
What the hell just happened?
- We just heard screams,
and all the people were just...
- Those're... those're bees.
- They're not bees.
Those are wasps.
- Who gives a shit?
Bees, wasps.
- We spray for wasps,
don't we, Sydney?
- It was mania.
It was hysteria.
- Oh...
- That's what it was.
- My puppy's out there.
- Fuck the pooch, ma.
- Who called 911?
- Uh, cell service is... is
virtually non-existent out here.
But there's... there's a phone
in the office.
- What did they say
when you called?
You didn't call?
-  Are you all insane?
- Nobody called 911?
- What am I supposed to say?
- You say the mayor has been
down. And that he can't retreat.
- Alright, listen, listen...
- Then you see what happens.
- Listen!
We need to find out.
Is anyone stung?
- I got him before he got me.
- Oh! God.
Well, that's good.
That's very good.
- Just hurry.
- No, Mrs. Perch. It's okay.
- Flora, it's not okay.
It's not...
You people don't seem...
You don't seem to see
how severe this is.
You need medical attention,
Mrs. Perch.
Everybody at your garden party
needs medical attention.
We need to move from the kitchen
to the front of the house
so when the EMTs arrive you can
easily get into the ambulance.
So why don't we do that?
- I'd rather just stay here.
- But you will show them
where we are.
- Okay. Can you please keep
an eye on her?
- Yeah, I will.
- Thank you.
-  Sydney, can you help me
find the fucking phone?
- My heart is racing.
Oh! Oh. Sydney!
You're just going to leave me?
- Flora will
take care of you, ma.
She's at least good at that.
- Hey, hey. I'm here.
- You're fuckin' kid...
What year is this?
What? What?
What the fuck just...
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck!
Okay, the phone's
not gonna work.
- Oh, that's great.
That's fuckin'...
Whoop-dee-doo!
- Help me!
Paul!
- How do I open
the fuckin' window?
- Need to open the door.
- How... how do we know
that he hasn't been...
- He's fine. He's right here.
He's fine!
- We have to let him in!
- Have you been stung?
- No. No. I tried to help them.
This is not my blood.
- Prove it!
- Prove it? He's fucking...
Listen, go around back
and I'll let you in.
- Save me.
- Fuck!
- Oh, fuck. Oh my.
Fuck!
Look out behind you.
- Oh, my God!
- What are we gonna fucking do?
- Get away...
- Fuckin'!
- Well...
- That's that.
-  That's that?
- We could have saved him.
- Want to let them suckers
in here too?
No thank you. Uh-uh.
-  Can't we just go around back
and go through the field
and then just keep going?
- That's the dumbest thing
I've heard all day.
Didn't you... Didn't you just see
what happened to that guy?
- Oh! Do you have
any better ideas?
- Both of you guys,
shut the fuck up!
Okay little wasps follow us
for fucking miles
if they're pissed off.
Sydney, we need...
We need a small area
that we can barricade.
Is there a cellar?
-  A basement.
What about the basement.
-  Basement?
-  It's like a fortress, right?
- You guys wanna hide?
- Yes!
- Let's hide.
- Yes. Wait, wait, wait!
Sydney, wait!
We need to get everybody
from the kitchen,
together we need to travel...
- Stop! Get away from her!
We gotta get her out of here!
- Help me grab her arm.
- Mom!
What? You wanna kill
me too now?
- Holy...
- Mother!
-  Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
- Come on.
- Let's go.
- Please. Help me.
- Oh, great! What we gotta drag
the Mexican around?
- I'm from fucking Argentina,
hijo de pu...
- Fuck!
Flora. Flora. Flora.
- Come on, let's go.
Come on.
- Sydney, wait! Wait for us!
-  Ah, Come on.
- They're inside.
They're inside.
- Open the door. Open the door.
Sydney, you gotta
open the door!
Right now!
You must open the door!
- Go! Go! Go!
- You have to open the fucking
door right now!
- Go... - Right now!
- Go, go, go!
- Get inside! Get inside!
-  Okay. They're
gonna break through.
-  No, the door's
to fire code standards.
Plus mom hates it down here.
She never comes
to the basement.
- She's not a she
anymore, Sydney.
- Oh, I found it!
- Ow! Fuck!
Oh, f...
Forgive my ever-loving mouth
but what the fuck
are we supposed to do now?
Anybody?
Oh...
What a wonderful selection.
- Uh, those are vintage.
- Really?
I see that.
It's a 1943 Bordeaux.
Excuse me. Hey.
- I forgot my bottle opener
upstairs.
- Can you help me open this?
Young man.
- Yeah, actually.
I have a trick.
You put the base in your shoe
so the glass doesn't break.
- What?
- You've blood on your face.
Ah!
-  It worked.
-  Ha.
- I could have saved
my last marriage
if I had a trick like that.
The dames must be dancing
all over you.
-  Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm swimming in putang
as my friends like to call it.
- Oh, God.
- They're not dames anymore.
Thanks.
- What?
- I don't know.
I think, you know...
You'd think she'd be grateful
that I'm here.
That I'm helping out.
I know she still treats me like
an employee, even now.
You know...
- She's holding up.
She's just afraid.
- I am, too.
- Yeah.
- I shot myself.
No, I mean it. I shot myself.
- Sorry.
- Work of art right there.
- It's not bad.
- You're kidding, right?
It looks like...
we're all taking a shit
or something.
When my, uh...
When my pops died...
my ma could barely even look
at that thing.
- You said there were good
times in your toast.
- Good times...
They both hated me.
To mom I was just a problem
and, uh, to dad
I was just some freak
he couldn't care.
And if there were good times,
I... I wasn't invited.
- You don't look so hot.
- Ah, you know, all those
people up there and...
Just all of the...
- I'm sorry...
about everything.
- You know, I just realized
if we all
make it out of here alive...
there's a great chance
I'm gonna get reelected
'cause I have
a hell of a lot to say.
Ah.
- Yeah.
-  With all that going on
out there...
How did you know what to do?
- Oh, I don't know.
I just, uh...
I just did.
I was a lifeguard
for a couple summers.
So, I guess it wore off.
- That must have been
a great gig.
- Last week I was there,
a little kid fell in the pool
and I just...
Instinct jump in. Saved him.
Got the water out of his lungs.
He was alive.
He said thank you to me.
You know, I put him
in the ambulance.
And a week later,
he died of pneumonia.
You know...
Saving people for what?
My instinct for what?
I never expected that shrimp
cocktails would sprout wings
and fucking eat people,
it's just...
God, I don't know.
- I've seen atrocities.
I was...
dug in with the ninth infantry.
Korea.
Saw thousands of bodies.
Hundreds of thousands of bodies.
As far as the eye could see.
I thought I'd take
those images to my grave.
Before I die.
You know what?
You really stood up.
Good work.
- Expensive.
- I know drinking on the job
is a big no-no.
But when people start losing
their limbs
and their eyeballs pop out
of their face.
I just, I find it... needed.
- Hmm. Well, I'd say
we're off the clock.
- Could you imagine
the overtime?
- I'm this close to a new oven
in the kitchen.
- I'd get an old VW bug.
Not to be ironic,
but just to be cool.
And I would just drive
the whole country,
all fifty states.
- All fifty states?
Even Hawaii?
- Oh, God. Hawaii? First.
- I mean, how're you gonna
get there?
- I-I would air lift it,
probably.
- It's gonna be a lot of money.
- Yeah, well, that's why
I need the overtime.
- Hmm.
- I know a joke.
- Good for you. Just one?
- Mm-hmm. Do you wanna hear it?
- Ahem, not really.
- I'm gonna tell you.
- Okay.
- What is a bee's favorite
movie?
- That's a tough one.
No idea.
- How the hell can
all of this be happening?
- Mu-mutations.
- What?
- Mutations, the-the fertilizer
for the garden
came from God only knows where.
- But my mom...
-  You're kidding.
Are you fucking kidding me?
- My mom didn't like the stuff
from the Garden Depot.
So I-I took my dad's leftover
growth hormones
and-and I mixed it
with the fertilizer.
- I'm sorry,
you're saying that you...
You spiced up some fertilizer?
- And now we're sitting
in a giant ball of wasp shit.
- You're saying you knew?
Those people are fucking dead
because of you.
- I didn't know about the bugs.
-  What the fuck
are you talking about?
- You're fucked up!
- They knocked the lights out.
How do they know
how to do that?
What are they,
electricians now?
- There's a back-up generator.
-  We'll wait till the sun
comes up.
And then we'll make a run
for it in the morning.
-  We have to drive the hell out
of here right now.
- Where are the keys?
Keys, keys. God, I lost
the fucking van keys.
- Alright, I'm gonna
retrace my steps.
I'm gonna find the keys
to the van
and we're gonna drive
'til we run out of gas.
- No! I won't let you go alone.
- Will you just shut the fuck
up and trust me, please?
I'm the only one who goes.
-  Don't, do-don't go
out there.
'cause the wasps will come in
here and lay eggs in me.
- How do I know
when you'll be back?
- You don't.
"Singing in the Rain."
The bee's favorite movie.
I mean, I know
it's a dead joke but...
I like it, I don't know.
Close the windows behind me.
Oh, Jesus. Fuck me!
What the fuck am I doing?
Okay, okay.
- That young man
has balls of steel.
To be a man
you have to be a man.
Yeah.
If you don't mind, I'm gonna try
that shoe trick again.
You alright?
- Hmm.
- Oh.
Percy.
Percy.
God damn it.
Percy...
- What's the matter with you?
Get away!
The weenie. He got bit
and didn't tell us.
- Percy.
- Oh!
- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God. Oh...
Oh, God! Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God!
- Help us.
- What is going on?
Alright.
Are you okay?
- Did you find the keys?
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- Is it still safe?
- No, it's not.
We have to go through
the house. Come on. Let's go.
Okay.
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, come on.
- Shh.
Alright. Just gotta go.
Shh.
- No.
- Okay.
- I got this.
Damn it!
This stuff's harder
than granite.
Shit.
Fuck!
I'll go.
- Come on! Quick!
- Hold on.
- Get out of here.
Kiss my ass!
- Come on.
Fuck!
Fuck!
- They're nailed shut. -It's
like fucking Fort Knox in here.
I don't wanna be here anymore.
I wanna be at home.
I gotta feed my dia...
my diabetic dog Ace.
Then, I'm gonna take a bath,
and I'm gonna go to bed.
That's what I need to do.
- I need to sell my business.
I mean, nobody's gonna hire
me after this.
Are you kidding me?
- I might need to get
a new job.
- As do I.
- You could be a good teacher.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You'd have little boys
giving you apples
and flirting with you.
- Oh, come on.
I think you'd be
a good janitor.
- I would be a good janitor.
I'm really good at cleaning.
- Not really.
- Are we gonna work
at the same school?
- If it's in Hawaii.
- I'm down with that.
I need to be warm.
- Ah. I love being warm.
I like cuddling.
- You know, you're a man. You're not
supposed to admit that, right?
- It's sexual.
There's touching involved.
Spooning. It's fu...
