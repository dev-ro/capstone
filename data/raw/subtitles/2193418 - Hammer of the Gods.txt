( waves crashing )
( seagulls cawing )
( flute music playing )
( thunder crashing )
( kisses )
( chuckles )
( shouting )
( screams )
( screams )
( growls )
YEAH!
( thunder crashing )
Grim:
STEINAR...
( chuckles )
YOU WERE RIGHT.
SOME OF THEM
DO HAVE BRAINS.
MORE THAN
CAN BE SAID FOR YOU,
YOU FUCKING ANIMAL.
( growls )
GOOD THAT WE WET
OUR BLADES SO QUICKLY.
THEY WERE JUST FARMERS.
WELL, NOW THEY'RE
FARMING IN HELL.
THE REST OF OUR BOATS
WILL BE IN BY NIGHTFALL.
BRING UP THE HORSES.
HALFDAN CAN FOLLOW
ONCE THEY'VE LANDED.
MY FATHER'S NOT
A PATIENT MAN.
GRIM, JOKUL.
IF HE'S A SAXON, HE'S GONNA
HAVE A FUCK OF A SURPRISE
- WHEN HE RIDES INTO US. 
- THAT'S NO SAXON.
SO THIS IS OUR WELCOME.
VALI, WHAT'S HAPPENED?
THE OMENS PROMISED VICTORY
IF WE ATTACKED EARLY.
THE GODS WERE
AGAINST US.
YOUR FATHER'S BADLY
WOUNDED, STEINAR.
TAKE ME TO HIM.
( men shouting,
groaning )
( men groaning,
coughing )
( screaming )
STEINAR.
BETTER LATE
THAN NEVER.
I CAME WHEN I SAID
I WOULD.
AND THIS IS THE ARMY
YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU?
HE WAS FED GRUEL
AT FIRST LIGHT.
THE ONIONS CAN
ALREADY BE SMELLED
THROUGH HIS STOMACH.
IF HIS GUTS ARE PIERCED,
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
WE CAN DO.
HOW LONG?
A WEEK, MAYBE LESS.
LISTEN, STEINAR,
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T
ALWAYS SEEN EYE TO EYE,
BUT WE'RE STILL
BROTHERS AFTER ALL
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT WHEN I'M KING
I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU'RE TAKEN CARE OF.
THE OMENS
DECEIVED US, STEINAR.
AN ARMY OF 500
ARE ONLY HOURS BEHIND ME.
ALL THIS TALK OF REASON...
SOUNDS LIKE A COVER-UP
FOR WEAKNESS.
WE LIE HERE BECAUSE
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
WE NEED LAND!
WE EITHER TAKE IT
OR OUR PEOPLE PERISH.
WE MAY HAVE LOST
THE BATTLE, FATHER,
BUT WE CAN STILL
WIN THE WAR.
( chuckling )
AND WHO'LL LEAD THEM?
YOU?
IN ALL YOUR
FUCKING FINERY?
I WILL LEAD
OUR ARMY, FATHER.
YOU'RE NO MORE FIT
THAN HE IS.
ONCE, MAYBE.
BUT AFTER
YOUR MOTHER LEFT...
YOU CHANGED,
TURNED YOUR BACK
ON THE GODS.
THOUGHT YOU KNEW
BETTER, HUH?
I AM STRONG ENOUGH
TO BE KING.
THEN PROVE IT.
YOUR HALF BROTHER--
MY BASTARD SON--
REFUSED TO ENTER
THE FIELD OF BATTLE.
I MADE HIM SWEAR AN OATH
TO WAIT TILL I RETURNED.
YOU KNOW THE PUNISHMENT
FOR THOSE THAT TURN THEIR
BACK IN COMBAT.
SEE IT'S DONE.
( hisses )
( sword tings )
I WILL DO IT, FATHER.
LEAVE HIM, HARALD.
LEAVE HIM!
GET OUT, NOW!
NOT YOU, STEINAR.
THERE'S A MAN
WORTHY OF THIS CROWN,
A MAN WITH FIRE
IN HIS HEART,
BRAVE ENOUGH
TO WIELD THE HAMMER
OF THE GODS--
MY FIRSTBORN.
YOU SAID YOU'D KILL ANYONE
WHO MENTIONED HIS NAME.
THE TIME HAS PASSED.
NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE HE IS.
HE HASN'T BEEN SEEN
FOR YEARS.
FIND YOUR BROTHER.
FIND HAKAN.
RETURN WITH A KING
WHO WILL LEAD US TO VICTORY.
I AM NEEDED HERE.
I MAY BE DYING,
BUT I'M STILL YOUR KING.
DEFY ME AGAIN,
AND I WILL CUT YOUR
HEART OUT MYSELF.
NOW SWEAR
ON THE MEMORY
OF YOUR MOTHER.
I SWEAR.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR
FUCKING MIND.
- I SWORE AN OATH.
- OATHS ARE HORSESHIT,
STEINAR.
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.
I WILL NOT BREAK IT.
HAKAN IS ALMOST CERTAIN
TO BE DEAD BY NOW.
AND IF HE'S NOT,
HE WAS FUCKING INSANE
BEFORE HE WAS BANISHED;
HE'LL ONLY BE
MORE SO NOW.
ANYWAY, WHO KNOWS
WHERE THE FUCK HE IS?
- YOU DO.
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
DANGEROUS, IS IT?
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
WHERE HE IS.
LISTEN,
SAY I DO KNOW--
WHICH I DON'T,
BUT SAY I DID--
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'D COME BACK?
IT'S THE KING'S WISH.
THE KING WILL BE
DEAD IN A WEEK.
BIDE YOUR TIME.
BE CLOSE AT HAND
WHEN HE DIES.
AND WHEN THE MOMENT'S RIGHT,
YOU TAKE THE CROWN
FOR YOURSELF.
WE'D ALL BACK YOU
AGAINST HARALD.
THINK ABOUT IT.
( insects chirping )
( birds chirping )
WHEN I SAID I DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE HAKAN WAS,
I SPOKE THE TRUTH.
BUT I DO KNOW
HOW TO FIND THE LAST
MAN WHO SAW HIM.
WHETHER HE'S
CAPABLE OF HELPING US
REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
- GOING SOMEWHERE?
- IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU, GRIM.
LET US PASS.
- LIKE FUCK.
-  YOU'D THINK DIFFERENTLY
IF YOU KNEW WHERE
WE WERE GOING.
WE'RE HEADING FOR
THE BLACK MOUNTAINS
IN SEARCH OF IVAR
THE BONELESS.
( chuckles )
THAT FAT FUCK?
LAST NIGHT I HEARD
HE CHOPPED HIS OWN
HEAD OFF.
WELL, I HEARD
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF
INTO A BEAR.
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH THAT COCKSUCKING
MANIAC ANYWAY?
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN LEAD US TO HAKAN.
IT'S A TWO-DAY RIDE
THROUGH SAXON COUNTRY,
AND WHO KNOWS AFTER THAT?
YOU THINK WE'RE COWARDS,
IS THAT IT?
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT
TO ME.
'CAUSE IF IT IS,
YOU CAN KISS MY FUCKING AXE.
I LOOKED AT THE BONES,
STEINAR.
IT'S ALREADY BEEN DECIDED--
WE'LL TRAVEL TOGETHER.
- THE BONES SAID THAT?
- AYE.
HOW FAR DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL GET?
TAKE US WITH YOU--
YOU DOUBLE YOUR ODDS.
( sighs )
NOT YOU, VALI.
WELL, WHY NOT?
'CAUSE YOUR SWORD'S
AS LIMP AS YOUR
COCK, BOY.
( chuckles )
STEINAR, TAKE ME
WITH YOU.
WATCH HARALD, HMM?
REPORT TO ME
WHEN I GET BACK.
THE SUN IS SINKING.
LET'S FIND A PLACE
TO REST.
YEAH.
Hagen: THERE WAS
A TIME WHEN THEY DID
EVERYTHING TOGETHER--
HAKAN AND IVAR.
Grim:
MY FATHER WENT
RAIDING WITH THEM--
FUCKING CARNAGE.
AFTER HAKAN WAS
BANISHED,
PEOPLE WERE LESS
WILLING TO TOLERATE
IVAR'S BEHAVIOR.
( animal hoots )
HE KNEW WHERE
HAKAN HAD GONE,
SO HE SET OFF
AFTER HIM.
WHY DO THEY CALL HIM
BONELESS?
( laughing )
BECAUSE YOU COULD
NEVER SEE HIS COCK,
'CAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS
RAMMED TO THE HILT
UP SOME YOUNG BOY'S
ASSHOLE.
THEY SAY HE FELT
NO PAIN.
WHICH IS MORE
THAN CAN BE SAID FOR
THE YOUNG BOY'S ASSHOLE.
( laughing )
I FOUGHT BESIDE HIM
A COUPLE OF TIMES.
WHATEVER PEOPLE
THINK OF IVAR NOW,
HE WAS SOMETHING
TO BEHOLD IN BATTLE.
THEY BOTH WERE.
WHY DID MY FATHER
BANISH HAKAN?
HE WAS CURSED.
YOUR FATHER HAD
HIS REASONS.
MAYBE IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HE DID.
IT DOES IF HE'S
GONNA BE KING.
- ( twig snaps ) 
- ( horse neighing )
STEINAR, IT'S ME!
ARGH!
YOU'LL GET
YOURSELF KILLED.
I DID AS YOU SAID.
I FOLLOWED HARALD.
HE RODE OUT ALMOST
THE MINUTE YOU LEFT.
HE CROSSED THE SAXON LINES
AND SPOKE TO THEIR KING.
FUCKING SNAKE!
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.
YOU DID THE RIGHT
THING, VALI.
YOU SHOULD HEAD BACK NOW,
BEFORE THEY NOTICE
YOU'RE GONE.
NO, IT'S TOO
DANGEROUS.
VALI CAN RIDE
WITH US.
GRIM, GET HIM
SOME FOOD.
HE CAN GET HIS OWN FOOD.
WE TURN BACK,
CUT HARALD'S BALLS OFF
AND RIP OUT HIS SPINE.
NO.  WE CONTINUE
OUR RIDE NORTH.
STEINAR, HARALD'S CUT
A DEAL WITH THE SAXONS.
OUR MEN WOULD NEVER
BACK HARALD.
IT'S ONE THING TO WANT
THE CROWN, ANOTHER TO TAKE IT.
YOU'D RATHER WE HAVE US
CLIMBING MOUNTAINS
ON SOME FUCKING BEAR HUNT
WHILE YOUR CUNT FUCK
OF A BROTHER
SELLS OUR WOMEN
TO A BUNCH OF FARMERS!
OUR WOMEN ARE MORE
THAN A MATCH FOR HARALD.
GRIM,
NOBODY FORCED YOU
TO COME.
NOBODY'S FORCING YOU
TO STAY.
( growls )
OH, I KNOW YOU STRUGGLE
WITH YOUR BELIEFS,
THAT YOU DENY THE GODS
AND THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF SIGNS...
BUT A LONE RIDER
ARRIVING UNDER
A FULL MOON?
EVEN YOU CAN'T DENY
WHAT A BAD OMEN THAT IS
FOR ALL OF US.
HE'S YOUNG.
HE'S GOT GOOD INSTINCTS.
HE BRINGS DEATH
WITH HIM.
I'M NOT ABOUT
TO TURN AGAINST HIM
FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR
SUPERSTITIONS.
IF A MAN DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN OMENS,
THEN HOW CAN HE KNOW
WHAT HE BELIEVES IN?
HE CAN BELIEVE
IN HIMSELF.
( thunder crashing )
( woman screaming )
NO!
WE SHOULD RIDE ON.
- Man: YOU BITCH!
- ( stones thud )
( screaming )
YOU'RE RIGHT.
STOP!
( screaming continues )
STOP.
- LET HER GO.
- FUCK YOU, HEATHEN.
ARGH!
( growls )
( moans )
( screaming )
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- CRAZY FUCKING BITCH.
LET'S GO.
THE HORSES WON'T MAKE IT
MUCH FURTHER.
THEN WE CONTINUE
ON FOOT.
VALI, YOU WAIT
WITH THE HORSES
TILL WE RETURN.
DON'T LIGHT
A FIRE.
FIRES ATTRACT
CAVE TROLLS.
DON'T WORRY.
THEY ONLY EAT VIRGINS.
( snickers )
THEY'LL EAT ANYTHING
IF THEY'RE HUNGRY ENOUGH.
SPEAKING OF CAVE TROLLS,
HOW IS YOUR SISTER?
FUCK YOU, GRIM.
SHE CERTAINLY DID.
STILL HURTS
WHEN I PISS.
WE'LL BE BACK
BY FIRST LIGHT.
STEINAR.
THANKS.
WE'RE BROTHERS.
( creature growls )
WHAT WAS THAT?
( creature growls )
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
WAIT TILL NIGHTFALL.
SOME CREATURES
FEAR THE MOON.
IT WOULD BE SAFER.
( creature growling
softly )
( yelling )
( chuckles )
IVAR, IT'S ME--
HAGEN GRETTISON.
MY NAME IS STEINAR,
SON OF BAGSECG.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
DOING HERE, PRINCE?
- YOU WANNA FUCK WITH ME?
- ( Steinar panting )
I'LL BET YOU DO.
I'LL BET YOU DO.
IVAR, THE KING IS DYING.
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
EVERYONE DIES
SOME TIME.
HOW ABOUT YOU, PRINCE?
DO YOU WANT
TO DIE TODAY?
WE SEEK THE NEW KING--
HAKAN.
( moans )
( inhaling )
SO YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR YOUR BROTHER?
KNOW WHERE HE IS?
WHY THE HELL
WOULD I TELL YOU?
( exhales )
OUT OF RESPECT.
( laughs )
RESPECT IS NOT
A BIRTHRIGHT,
LITTLE PRINCE.
YOU WANT
SOMEONE'S RESPECT,
YOU'VE GOT TO EARN IT.
YOU WANT TO EARN
MY RESPECT?
YOU'D BETTER BE STRONGER
THAN YOU LOOK.
- THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY.
- HE FEELS NO PAIN.
THE ONLY WAY HE'LL TELL US
IS THROUGH CHOICE.
THREE CUPS FOR YOUR
THREE CHANCES.
YOU WIN-- I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.
I WIN-- YOU DRINK.
YOU DRINK ALL THREE--
YOU LOSE
AND YOU'RE MINE
FOR THE NIGHT,
TO DO WITH AS I SEE FIT.
AH. ( laughs )
FIRST TO FOLD OR BREAK.
BEGIN!
Hagen:
COME ON, STEINAR.
- COME ON, STEINAR.
- Grim: PUT YOUR SHOULDER
 INTO IT.
- Jokul: TAKE HIM, STEINAR. 
- Hagen: COME ON, STEINAR.
- Grim: COME ON. 
- Hagen: TAKE HIM.
( laughs )
DRINK UP,
LITTLE PRINCE.
THAT'LL PUT HAIRS
ON YOUR BALL SACK.
TELL ME
YOU HAVE A PLAN.
SHALL WE GO AGAIN
WHILE OUR COCKS
ARE STILL HARD?
- FIRST TO FOLD OR BREAK.
- ( Ivar growls )
- BEGIN.
- COME ON.
- PUT YOUR SHOULDER INTO IT.
- COME ON.
Grim:
COME ON!
COME ON.
Men:
COME ON, STEINAR.
( men continue shouting )
- OH, FUCK!
- FUCK.
TWO DOWN,
ONE TO GO.
WHAT CHANCE NOW,
PRINCESS, HMM?
( laughs )
( distorted sounds )
JOKUL, YOUR BELT.
GIVE ME YOUR BELT, QUICK.
YOUR BELT.
GOOD, STEINAR.
THE SERPENT WILL
PROTECT YOU.
WITH THE GODS
ON YOUR SIDE,
YOU CAN'T LOSE. HMM?
YEAH.
WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK.
YOU KNOW THAT.
BUT THE ONLY WAY
WE'LL STOP HIM IS
IF WE KILL HIM.
Ivar: AHH.
I AM LOOKING FORWARD
TO MAKING A WOMAN OUT
OF YOU, PRINCESS.
OH, DON'T LOOK SO SAD.
YOU MIGHT EVEN ENJOY IT.
( laughing )
FIRST TO FOLD OR BREAK.
BEGIN.
COME ON, STEINAR, PUSH!
COME ON, BREAK HIS
FUCKING WRIST.
( men yelling )
COME ON! COME ON!
OH. OH. ARGH!
( men giggling )
OOH OOH.
OOH.
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS?
STEINAR.
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE,
STEINAR.
I LIKE ASSHOLES.
I DIDN'T LEAVE
OUT OF CHOICE.
I BECAME
PERSONA NON GRATA.
THAT'S LATIN.
HAKAN TAUGHT ME THAT.
HE'S A PRODIGIOUS MAN,
A GREAT MAN REALLY.
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
WITH HIM NOW?
YOU KILL
PEOPLE IN BATTLE--
THEY LOVE YOU FOR IT.
MAKE A MISTAKE
WITH A COUPLE OF BOYS--
THEY TREAT YOU
LIKE A LEPER.
( distorted sounds )
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE,
PRINCESS.
FEELING
THE 'SHROOMS-S-S-S?
( laughing )
AH, HAKAN'S NOT
THE MAN HE WAS.
NOT A MAN AT ALL
REALLY.
YOU SEE, WE'RE--
WE'RE ALL THIS,
BUT HE--
HE'S ALL THAT UP THERE,
ALL AROUND US.
DO YOU THINK
HE IS JUST GONNA PACK UP
AND FOLLOW YOU,
RULE THE PEOPLE
THAT BANISHED HIM?
WHY WOULD HE EVEN SPEAK
TO YOU, LOOK AT YOU?
HE ALREADY KNOWS
YOU'RE COMING.
THEN HE WON'T MIND...
IF YOU TELL US
WHERE HE IS.
BUT IF I DO THAT,
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.
WELL, EVERYBODY HAS TO DIE.
( laughs )
OH.
OH, FUCK IT, PRINCESS,
I'LL DO BETTER THAN
TELL YOU WHERE HE IS.
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE
MYSELF.
WHY THE HELL NOT?
WHY THE FUCKING HELL
NOT, HMM?
( all laugh )
AH.
( breathing strongly )
HELPS YOU SEE
THROUGH THE CLOUDS,
TO FIND THE SUN.
- IS IT MAGIC?
- NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC.
IT'S INSCRIBED.
YEAH.  WHO TAUGHT YOU
TO READ?
I WAS AT A MONASTERY.
THEY TAUGHT ME...
MANY THINGS.
HERE, HERE YOU GO.
HAVE THIS.
YOU BLOW IT.
( both chuckle )
( Hagen sighs )
BONELESS SAYS
THERE'S A RUNESTONE
TWO DAYS FROM HERE
AT THE EDGE OF A FOREST
AT THE FOOT OF
THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS.
SAYS HE'LL TAKE US THERE
AND THE RUNES WILL
LEAD US TO HAKAN.
- AND YOU TRUST HIM?
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE HE'S A MANIAC.
-  OH YEAH, THAT HE IS.
BUT HE'S
OUR MANIAC NOW.
VALI!
FIRST THE SUN,
AND NOW THE ASHES
PAINTED RED.
VALI!
VALI!
- STEINAR.
- VALI.
- STEINAR. 
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
WHAT HAPPENED?
MEN CAME.
LAST NIGHT.
I HEARD VOICES.
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
HOW COME THERE'S NOT
A SCRATCH ON YOU?
IT'S ANOTHER OMEN.
WE SHOULD TURN BACK.
THE GODS ARE AGAINST US.
WHO DID THIS?
THIEVES?
THIEVES WOULD HAVE TAKEN
ALL THE HORSES.
SOMEONE TRYING
TO FUCK WITH YOU.
YOU WANNA FUCK WITH US?
COME ON.
COME ON!
IVAR, HOW LONG
WILL IT TAKE US
TO GET THERE ON FOOT?
DEPENDS HOW
DETERMINED YOU ARE.
DETERMINED.
WE SHOULD WAIT
FOR THE MOON
TO GUIDE US.
SHUT YOUR MOUTH
ABOUT THE FUCKING MOON.
-  ( twig snaps ) 
-  ( running footsteps )
( whispers )
LISTEN.
VALI, YOU TWO,
WAIT HERE.
( swords unsheathing )
FUCK THIS.
LET'S FIGHT!
GRIM!
ARGH!
( growls )
FUCK.
( men yelling )
STEINAR!
( groans )
( panting )
ARGHH!
- ( distant men shouting ) 
- ( swords clashing )
( panting )
( chuckling )
( yelling )
( gurgles )
( grunts )
WE SHOULD GO AFTER THEM,
FINISH THEM OFF.
WE MOVE ON.
I TOLD YOU TO WAIT.
I'M NOT A CHILD,
STEINAR.
GO AND GET THE GIRL.
NOW.
Jokul:
STEINAR!
STEINAR!
HE DIED A GOOD DEATH,
WITH HIS AXE
IN HIS HAND.
VALHALLA WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT THEM.
( crows cawing )
THERE'S A CLEAR VIEW
ON THE HILL.
VALI, GET UP THERE,
SHOUT IF YOU SEE
ANYTHING.
HOW'S IVAR?
NEARLY DONE.
WE NEED TO MOVE ON
AS SOON AS WE CAN.
WE HAVE TO REACH HAKAN.
THEY WERE
NO ORDINARY SAXONS.
THEY WERE
TOO WELL ARMED,
TOO WELL TRAINED.
THEY DIDN'T JUST
RUN INTO US.
YOU THINK
WE'RE BEING HUNTED?
IF HARALD MADE AN ALLIANCE
WITH THEIR KING,
THEN GETTING RID OF ME
WOULD BE PART OF THE DEAL.
THEY'D NEED TO KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK FOR YOU.
MAYBE SOMEONE'S
HELPING THEM.
DON'T TELL ME YOU BELIEVE
IN ALL THAT CRAP ABOUT
MOONS AND OMENS.
I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE
WITH MY OWN EYES.
RIGHT.
HERE.
VALI DROPPED IT.
LOOK AT THE MARKINGS.
IT'S A SAXON COIN.
YOU THINK VALI IS
A SERVANT OF OUR ENEMIES?
IF HE SERVES HARALD,
WHO HIMSELF SERVES THE SAXONS,
IT AMOUNTS TO THE SAME THING.
ALL FROM
A PIECE OF SILVER?
HE'S MY BROTHER.
HALF BROTHER.
HIS MOTHER'S A SAXON.
- LISTEN TO YOURSELF.
- YOU SAY YOU BELIEVE
IN REASON
AND LOGIC.
WHEN IT'S PRESENTED
TO YOU, YOU TURN
YOUR BACK ON IT.
IN WHAT WAY
DO MY ACTIONS BETRAY
A LACK OF REASON?
YOU RUN WHEN YOU
SHOULD FIGHT.
YOU SET OFF ON THIS
MEANINGLESS QUEST
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE
LEADING YOUR PEOPLE.
AND THEN YOU SIDE
WITH A BASTARD TRAITOR
WHO WOULD STICK
A KNIFE IN YOUR BACK,
RATHER THAN
YOUR OLDEST FRIEND.
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO, HUH?
HMM?  KILL HIM?
BETTER IF YOU DID.
HE'S A CHILD.
THINK ABOUT THAT.
THINK ABOUT
YOUR TWO DAUGHTERS.
DARK TIMES
CALL FOR DARK DEEDS,
STEINAR.
YOU'RE WRONG, HAGEN.
THEY CALL FOR LIGHT.
STEINAR!
COME ON.
HURRY UP!
( horses neighing )
- WE CAN'T OUTRUN THEM!
- I'LL SLOW THEM DOWN!
( screaming )
DAMN.
( groans )
( growls )
WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?
COME ON, YOU MUST
HAVE A NAME.
GO FUCK YOURSELF.
THAT'S DISAPPOINTING.
I HAD EXPECTED MORE
FROM A PRINCE.
WHATEVER DEAL YOU STRUCK
WITH MY BROTHER,
IT WON'T LAST.
( chuckles )
BROTHER.
RIGHT NOW
WE'RE IN A POSITION
WHERE WE CAN HELP
EACH OTHER.
I COULD HELP
MAKE SURE
YOU BECOME KING
OF YOUR PEOPLE.
WE COULD FORGE
A REAL ALLIANCE
THAT COULD LAST
GENERATIONS.
- UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS?
- UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF A BENEVOLENT KING
AND A CHURCH
THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE
EDUCATION AND LEARNING.
WELL, I CAN SEE THE BENEFITS
IN EDUCATION AND LEARNING,
BUT WHEN YOU START
TALKING ABOUT YOUR GOD,
REASON
DOESN'T REALLY
COME INTO IT, DOES IT?
THINK ABOUT IT.
( smacks lips )
COME ON, JUST A SIP.
( man screams )
CUT MY ROPES.
- ( man growling )
- WATCH OUT!
STAB HIM AGAIN.
- ( screaming )
-  AND AGAIN.
AND AGAIN.
AND AGAIN.
( gurgles )
( girl sobbing )
( panting )
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
DIDN'T LIKE
BEING TIED UP.
TOOK ONE OF THE GUARD'S
EARS OFF.
WHERE'S VALI?
HE WENT WITH THEM
TO MEET THEIR HOLY MEN
AND BOW DOWN
BEFORE THE WHITE CHRIST.
KEEP HIM ALIVE.
WE NEED HIM TO TELL US
WHERE WE'RE GOING.
- I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT VALI.
- LOOK, STEINAR.
HE DENIED THE EXISTENCE
OF THE GODS.
HE BEGGED
TO BE CONVERTED.
LET THE BOY GO.
YOU DARE BREAK THE SANCTITY
OF THE HOUSE OF GOD?
YOU TALK OF REASON.
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
YOU'RE JUST
AS SUPERSTITIOUS
AS THE REST OF THEM.
NOW LAY DOWN
YOUR WEAPONS
AND LET THE BOY GO.
OH, WE WILL
HUNT YOU DOWN
AND KILL YOU
LIKE THE GODLESS
ANIMALS YOU ARE.
YOU GO TO SUCH LENGTHS
TO BUILD THESE CHURCHES,
MAKING SURE
THEY STRIKE TERROR
INTO THE HEARTS
OF ALL WHO COME NEAR.
IT'S JUST A ROOM
WITH A DOOR...
NO DIFFERENT
TO A PRISON.
Woman:
STEINAR!
SECURE THEM INSIDE!
GET IN!
DO WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED
TO FIND HAKAN?
YOU WERE TRUE
TO YOUR WORD.
REMEMBER ME
TO HIM, PRINCE.
WHEN YOU SEE HIM,
HIS EYES PIERCE THE SOUL.
HE KNOWS
WHO YOU TRULY ARE, HMM?
LIKE A GOD...
SEES MEN.
YOU BELIEVE IN THE GODS,
DON'T YOU, HMM?
YOU BELIEVE IN...
VALHALLA?
YEAH.
OH.
- VALHALLA, I'M COMING.
- ( gasping )
- ( woman sobbing )
- SHH SHH.
WHOSE WAS THIS?
- IT BELONGED TO MY MOTHER.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?
SHE WAS
SWALLOWED UP
INTO THE DARKNESS.
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.
( people screaming )
- ARE YOU FINISHED?
- THE BOY.
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?
- HE WENT WILLINGLY,
PREPARED TO ACCEPT
THE WHITE CHRIST.
IT WAS THAT OR DEATH.
YOU DIDN'T YIELD
AND NEITHER DID WE.
AND I WON'T NOW.
VALI HAS BROUGHT US
NOTHING BUT BAD LUCK.
IF WE OFFER HIM UP
AS A SACRIFICE,
THE GODS WILL LOOK OVER US
FOR THE REST OF OUR JOURNEY.
IT'S WORTH IT TO SAFEGUARD
THE FUTURE OF OUR PEOPLE.
SO LONG AS THERE'S
MEN WHO THINK LIKE YOU,
OUR PEOPLE HAVE NO FUTURE.
HE'S A TRAITOR AND A COWARD.
AND HE DESERVES TO DIE.
- STEP ASIDE, STEINAR.
- DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.
THEN YOU LEAVE ME
NO CHOICE.
( yells )
YIELD!
( gurgles )
( wheezing )
NO!
NO!
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
IN THE CHURCH?
( distant screaming
continues )
( exhales )
( crashing )
( thunder rumbling )
WAIT.
Jokul:
NO, WE SHOULDN'T
TOUCH IT.
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS ISN'T JUST
SOMEBODY'S HEAD ON A STICK.
THIS IS A SIGN.
THIS IS TELLING US
TO STAY THE FUCK AWAY.
Vali:
WELL, WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A RUNESTONE.
THIS IS WHAT IVAR WAS
LEADING US TO.
THIS ISN'T GOOD, STEINAR,
I'M TELLING YOU.
TO FIND HAKAN, WE HAD
TO FIND THIS FIRST.
WHAT DOES IT SAY?
THIS ISN'T TELLING US
HOW TO FIND HAKAN.
IT'S A WARNING,
SAYING WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IF WE TRY.
WELL, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
IT MEANS WE'RE CLOSE,
NOTHING MORE,
NOTHING LESS.
I CAN'T GO IN THERE,
STEINAR.
I JUST CAN'T.
- NOTHING TO FEAR, JOKUL.
- I KNOW THESE THINGS.
IF I STEP FOOT IN THAT
FOREST, I'M DEAD.
YOU'LL BE DEAD
IF YOU DON'T.
( heart beating )
JOKUL.
( echoing )
AGNES!
( echoing )
( heartbeat echoing )
( grunts, rock thuds )
YOU'RE NOT DEAD...
NOT YET ANYWAY.
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU'RE NOT DEAD?
HUH?
HUH?  HUH?
BECAUSE HE CHOSE IT.
HE DECIDES WHO LIVES,
WHO DIES.
WHO ARE YOU, HUH?
I AM
ULRIC THE CHRONICLER...
A HUMBLE SERVANT
OF THE GREAT MASTER.
WELL, ULRIC,
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
TELLING THE GREAT MASTER
THAT HIS BROTHER'S HERE
TO SEE HIM.
( chuckles )
HE HAS NO BROTHER,
NO FATHER, NO MOTHER.
I'LL TELL HIM
WHAT YOU SAID THOUGH.
IT MIGHT AMUSE HIM.
( distorted voices,
screams )
( sword unsheathes )
( laughing )
( panting )
( breathing heavily )
VALI?
( exhales )
VALI, UNTIE ME.
VALI, WHERE'S AGNES?
WHERE'S JOKUL?
VALI?
( Steinar moaning )
( crowd shouting,
cheering )
( drums beating )
- ( grunts )
- ( cheering, drumming stop )
( speaking foreign language )
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM HOME, STEINAR.
SO IS HE.
THIS IS HIS HOME.
OUR FATHER'S DYING.
WHAT DO YOU SEE...
WHEN YOU THINK
OF HOME?
I THINK OF THE...
THE BLUE OF THE SKY,
THE GREEN
OF THE FOREST.
THE SMELL
OF THE PINE TREES.
I SEE NOTHING.
NOTHING...
BUT DARKNESS.
WHY HAVE YOU
COME HERE?
OUR FATHER SENT ME.
HE SENT ME
TO BRING YOU BACK...
TO LEAD YOUR PEOPLE
AS KING.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU ASK,
BUT YOU WILL.
( speaking foreign
language )
LET THE FEAST BEGIN!
( cheering )
( drums beating )
FRIENDS,
- THIS IS A MOMENTOUS DAY.
- Man: YEAH!
THIS IS A TRULY
MOMENTOUS OCCASION.
- COMMENCE THE FESTIVITIES!
- ( cheering )
THE PEOPLE I ARRIVED WITH--
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?
( crunches )
( speaks foreign
language )
( laughs )
( speaks foreign
language )
( sniffs )
( speaking foreign
language )
( crowd laughing )
( speaking foreign
language )
HEY,
HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN HAKAN LEFT?
10, 11.
WERE YOU NEVER CURIOUS
AS TO WHY?
I ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
I NEVER WANTED US
TO BE SEPARATED.
NO MOTHER WOULD EVER WISH
FOR SUCH A THING.
BUT THAT'S ALL
GOING TO CHANGE NOW.
NOW IS THE TIME
FOR THE WORLD
TO BOW DOWN
