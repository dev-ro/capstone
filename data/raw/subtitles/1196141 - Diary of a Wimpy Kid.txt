RODRICK: (WHISPERING) Greg?
GREG: (GROGGILY) Mmm.
(IN SINGSONG) Greg?
What?
Greg !
Huh?
What?
What are you doing?
Get up!
Mom and Dad
have been
calling you for an hour.
You're about to be late
for your first day
of middle school.
What?
Oh, geez!
How did that happen?
Go, go, go!
Mom's about to flip out!
She sent me to get you
while she waits in the car!
(EXCLAlMS)
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Getting ready for. . .
(HOOTlNG)
. . .school.
Are you insane?
School doesn't start
till next week.
And, FYl,
school doesn't start
at 4:00 in the morning !
You woke up Manny.
And if he doesn't
go back down. . .
Good morning !
There is no way
he is going back down.
l just wanted to
sleep till 6:00.
Bubby!
FRANK: Go to bed.
l got him.
Greg, what are you doing up
making all this noise?
lt was Rodrick!
He woke me up!
He changed my clock!
(SNORlNG)
But l swear,
he was just. . .
Go to bed.
What is that smell?
l can't
even identify it.
Bubby!
(GRUNTS)
(GlGGLlNG)
KlDS: Happy Birthday!
Here, Bubby.
GREG: Wow! Look at the size
of that flamethrower!
Okay, first of all,
let me get
something straight.
This is a journal,
not a diary.
Yeah, l know
what it says
on the cover.
But when my mom went out
to buy this thing,
l specifically told her
not to buy one
that said "diary" on it.
This just proves
Mom doesn't understand
anything about kids my age.
Huh?
Sissy!
The only reason l agreed
to write in this thing
is because
when l'm rich and famous
l'll have
better things to do
than answer
people's stupid questions
all day long.
Gregory, tell us
about your childhood !
Were you always so smart
and handsome?
Here's my journal.
Now, shoo, shoo.
SUSAN:
That's our boy up there.
Why did l ever say
no to him?
Mom got me this thing
so l could write down
my feelings about
starting middle school.
But l'm gonna be fine.
lt's my best friend,
Rowley Jefferson,
l'm worried about.
He's definitely not
middle school ready.
Geronimo!
(WHOOPS)
He's not quite clear
on the concept
of growing up.
l want a puppy, a kitty,
a gumball machine. . .
But anyway, this is
about me, not Rowley.
l always figured
they'd make a movie
about my life.
But l didn't think
they'd start
the story here.
Because, seriously,
who wants to see a movie
about a kid
who's stuck in middle school
with a bunch of morons?
(ALARM BUZZlNG)
(GROANS)
(RODRlCK EXCLAlMlNG)
Three days, no shower.
Smell the love!
Let me go, Rodrick!
(GROANS)
Come on.
We're just having
some fun, right?
No, okay. So, look.
Mom asked me
to give you some advice
about middle school.
lt's real simple.
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't look at anyone.
Don't go anywhere.
Don't sit down.
Don't raise your hand.
Don't go to the bathroom.
Don't get noticed.
Don't choose
the wrong locker. Don't. . .
Who am l kidding?
You'll be dead
or homeschooled by
the end of the year, anyway.
And don't be seen
with Rowley.
(EXCLAlMlNG)
Manny, stop it! Mom !
RODRlCK: Thanks for
the eggs, Mom.
Frank?
Greg?
l think it's gross
and undignified
that l have to eat breakfast
next to him on the potty.
Okay, well, it's your fault
he's still potty training.
Don't look down, Manny.
The potty monster
doesn't like it
when you look at him.
(SCREAMS)
l was just joking with him.
Okay. Kiss him you're sorry
and then let's get a move on.
Can't be late for
your first day of school.
(SCHOOL BELL RlNGlNG)
GREG: Let me just say
for the record that I think
middle school may be
the dumbest idea
ever invented.
You got kids like me
who haven't hit
their growth spurt yet
mixed in with gorillas
who have to shave twice a day.
There's juvenile delinquents
and weirdos.
I'm smaIIer than about
95% of the kids
at my school...
CHlRAG:
Give it back! Stop!
...so thank God
for Chirag Gupta.
lt's mine! Stop!
Can l have
the backpack?
You got to jump higher.
lt's not yours!
He's an exceIIent buffer
between me and these morons.
Hey, Greg.
Hey, fella!
SeriousIy, I don't know
what happened to these kids
over the summer.
Was there a nucIear accident?
Science experiment
gone bad?
Thank God there are a few
normal people or this place
wouId be a totaI freak show.
lf you're as discriminating
as I am,
it can be tough to figure out
where to sit on your first day
of middIe schooI.
One bad move
and you're stuck
next to some idiot
for the rest of the year.
(SNlFFLlNG)
ROWLEY: Greg !
Remember how I said
Rowley wasn't
middle school ready?
Well, there you go.
(SPEAKlNG SPANlSH)
What are you wearing?
My family just got back
from Guatemala!
lt's my serape!
Nice, huh?
All right, class,
l'm Mrs. Flint.
Everybody take your seats!
(GROANS)
Welcome to your first day
of middle school.
Remember your seats.
You'll be sitting here
every day.
Rowley, if you
had to say where
you were ranked
in terms of
popularity
from one to 200,
where would you
put yourself?
ls 200 good or bad?
l'd say you're somewhere
around the 1 54 mark.
l'd put myself
around number 1 9 or 20.
l might even have a shot
at the top spot
by the end of the year,
if things go the way
l think they will.
Well, who's at the bottom?
Hey, guys, wanna see
my secret freckle?
(BOTH GROAN)
GREG: Fregley.
Sent home for hygiene issues
at Ieast once a month.
Check it out.
lt's got a hair in it!
What color is that?
You wanna help me name it?
All right, ladies!
Gather around !
Come on,
put the knitting down !
Let's go!
All right, everybody.
l'm Coach Malone
and l am your gym teacher.
P. E. is as much
a part of my life
as waking up in the morning
and going to the bathroom.
l live and breathe
Physical Education.
Now, who's with me?
Are you ready to have
some fun out there?
Yeah !
MALONE:
All right, outstanding !
So we're gonna
divide you up
into two teams.
So you two, over here.
You, you, you, this way.
Yeah, you three,
this side. Good.
You guys are going to
be Shirts!
And you will be Skins.
Why are we Skins?
l hate this.
He's just trying to make
kids like us feel bad.
What do you mean,
kids like us?
l just don't want
to get a sunburn,
right, Rowley?
(lN ROBOTlC VOlCE)
My name is Bell E. Button.
What's yours?
Okay, let's start off
with a little game
l like to call Gladiator.
(BOYS EXCLAlMlNG)
BOY 1 : l got this one!
BOY 2: No!
BOY 3: Take that!
(GRUNTS)
(NEVER MlSS A BEAT PLAYING)
Cover me!
Oh, God.
Not good !
We're never going
to be able to
outrun these guys!
We don't have to
outrun them !
We just have to
outrun Chirag !
Take a Iook,
take a Iook,
take a Iook
At the kids on the street
No, they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Think they saw us?
No way.
They were focused on
getting that kid
with the limp.
We'll hide here
for the rest
of the class
because l'm not
playing that game.
lt's not fair.
He's got all
the Neanderthals
on the same team.
lt's barbaric!
ANGlE: lt's completely
barbaric.
This place is an
intellectual wasteland.
But, you know,
it's nice to
meet someone
more interested
in his mind
than in his body.
You girls get to jump rope.
What are you doing hiding?
Avoiding the pain.
lt all starts
in middle school,
you know?
You're not a kid anymore.
The coddling has stopped.
Kids are now separated
by intelligence.
The weak are picked on.
And girls you've known
since kindergarten won't
even talk to you anymore.
Okay, well,
sounds like you got it
all figured out,
so go back
to your book.
This place is
a glorified holding pen.
MALONE: All the way!
All the way!
You're like a machine!
ANGlE: lt's where
adults put you
as you make that
awkward transition
between child and teenager
so they don't even
have to look at you.
Hi. l'm Angie.
Great story.
We're gonna go now.
Why? This is
a good spot.
lt's a perfect spot.
l survived all of
the sixth grade here.
And l would enjoy
some like-minded company
to get me through
the seventh.
ls that the whistle?
l think l hear the whistle.
We need to go.
MALONE: No showboating,
all right?
Why are we leaving?
We could get killed
out here in the open !
Put your shirt on.
They'll think
we're on their team.
Besides, getting crushed
is better than being seen
with that freak job.
Trust me, you can't
recover from
social suicide.
l never talked to a girl
that long before.
Whoa!
Check that out.
ls that cheese?
Stop!
Good God, man !
You almost got
the Cheese Touch.
The what?
The Cheese Touch.
Nobody knows
when or how,
but one day that cheese
mysteriously appeared
on the blacktop.
Nobody knew
who it belonged to.
Nobody touched it.
Nobody threw it away.
And so there it sat,
growing more foul
and powerful by the day.
Then one day,
a kid named Darren WaIsh
made the biggest mistake
of his Iife.
Darren touched
the cheese!
No, l didn't!
l just looked at it!
Really!
CHlRAG: Darren had
the Cheese Touch!
It was worse
than nucIear cooties.
He became an outcast.
(CRYlNG)
The only way to get rid
of the Cheese Touch
was by passing it on
to someone eIse.
(SCREAMS)
And so began
the Cheese Touch Frenzy.
Friend turning on friend.
Brother turning on sister.
It was madness.
Until a German
exchange student named
Dieter Muller took it away.
Dieter has
the Cheese Touch !
Ze Cheese Touch?
Vat is it?
Vat does it mean,
ze Cheese Touch??
Sadly for Dieter,
that fact
was lost in translation.
Nooooooooo......!
Thankfully, he moved back
to DÃ¼sseIdorf and took
the Cheese Touch with him.
And so the cheese sits,
patiently waiting
for its next victim.
Wow.
Wow.
This is
a terrible place.
No doors?
None.
l'm not pooping
until l'm in
high school.
GREG: The cafeteria,
possibly the cruelest place
on Earth.
But I was about
to make some kid's day
by sitting next to him.
That seat's saved.
For who?
lt's saved.
That one's saved, too.
So not happening.
Uh-uh-uh.
Taken.
Where are we
supposed to eat?
l guess this is where
all the cool guys hang out.
(SNEEZES)
Fregley must have bumped
his head when he was IittIe,
like, really hard.
(BURPS)
Okay, okay,
so my first day
could have gone better,
but at Ieast
I wasn't humiIiated.
Hey, Greg !
You want to come over
and play?
(KlDS LAUGHlNG)
What did he just
say to you?
Oh.
l think my ride's here.
Hey, guys.
So this guy
says to that guy,
"You wanna
come over and play?"
Yeah ! Do you guys
wanna play with us?
(BOYS LAUGHlNG)
See? This is the probIem.
Right now l have to take abuse
from these morons.
But in 20 years,
Quentin here
will be working for me.
Greg, please don't fire me.
l really need
my measly, pathetic job
scooping your dog's poop.
Whatever.
l'll think about it.
No, no, no.
Vanilla on the bottom
and chocolate on the top!
l can't eat this!
"Play," Rowley? "Play"?
l've told you, like,
a billion times
that guys our age say
"hang out," not "play."
Oops.
Seriously, if you're not
gonna listen to me,
just tell me,
'cause if you
pull another stunt
like that,
we'll be stuck on
the cafeteria floor
for the rest of
middle school.
l found half
a Snickers bar
down there.
l can't be the guy
who eats off his lap
in the cafeteria.
l should be at the top
of the food chain by now.
Something's got to
change, fast.
My mom told me
to just be myself and
people would like me.
That would be good advice
if you were somebody else.
(LOUD ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG)
Hey, little brother.
Was your first day as crappy
as l said it would be?
No. Not at all.
You were wrong.
lt was actually
better than l. . .
Worse.
(CHUCKLES)
You didn't listen to me,
did you?
l told you not to talk,
look or go anywhere,
and what happened?
He had to eat his lunch
on the floor.
Rowley.
(LAUGHlNG) Perfect.
And if nobody wants you
sitting at their table,
you think they want
Chummy Buttons over here?
l was right. You're not even
gonna make it
out of there alive.
The only chance you have
of making the yearbook is
when they dedicate it
to your memory.
So you wanna play
Twisted Wizard?
No. l have
a better idea.
lf he catches you in here,
he will kill you.
Literally, kill you.
Don't worry.
As long as we hear the music,
we're okay.
(LOUD MUSlC PLAYlNG)
Whoa. Yeah. Wow.
l didn't know Rodrick
was into motorcycles.
l found it.
Found what?
Rodrick's middle school
yearbook.
This thing holds
all the answers.
Rowley, this thing
is like a bible.
See this? This is where
a person like me
needs to be.
The class favorites.
They're the best
in their class.
These people
aren't nobodies.
They're famous.
They don't have to worry
about getting a seat
in the cafeteria, either.
Check this out.
There's tons of things
l qualify for.
"Most Likely To Succeed,"
"Best Looking,"
"Class Clown."
They should just
give that to me right now.
Don't you have to be
funny for that?
Hey! We could try
for cutest friends!
What did l tell you
would happen if you ever
went in my room again?
But your band
is still playing.
lt's the bass solo,
Turd Burglar!
Don't you know anything
about music?
Now, l came up here
to get a new drumstick,
and now, Greg,
since Mom and Dad
are gone,
l'm going to kill you.
Literally, kill you !
l told you.
Beat it.
Okay, but l just want
to say one thing !
Run, Greg, run !
What?
Let go, Baby Hippo!
(LAUGHlNG)
You're gonna have to
come out sometime, loser!
l'll wait here
as long as it takes.
And then, you're dead.
Time out, Rodrick.
l have to pee.
(CHUCKLES) No time outs.
Only death !
But l really
have to go.
Don't care.
(WATER GURGLlNG)
(GURGLlNG)
(EXCLAlMS)
(SlGHS)
(HUMMlNG)
Move over!
l'm dying.
(SlGHlNG DEEPLY)
Got you !
(SCREAMlNG)
Greg, did you throw
Manny off his. . .
What is going on?
Greg started it.
l just came in here
to take a shower.
He's lying !
He was gonna kill me
'cause l was in his room !
And so you peed on him?
Yes. l mean, no.
l mean. . .
Yes.
(WHlSTLlNG)
(ALL CHATTERlNG)
(SCHOOL BELL RlNGS)
Wow, there's a lot
to sign up for.
You could be class favorite
in a bunch of things.
Jazz dancing !
We could do
that one together!
l can't believe
all these activities.
They're all so much work.
Staying after school,
meeting before school,
on weekends.
What kind of
extracurricular activities
are these?
Out of my way.
Who let you into this school,
Greg Heffley?
l was thinking
the same thing about you,
Patty Farrell.
You listen to me,
Greg Heffley.
l'm running for
student council president
and l'm warning you,
if you get in my way,
l will beat you up,
just like l did
in kindergarten
and fourth grade.
Fourth grade?
That one was ugly.
What's her problem?
What did l ever do to her?
Patty, Patty is a fatty,
has a face just like a ratty!
(CRYlNG)
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
Come on,
that was pretty funny.
She needs to get
a sense of humor.
And l need something
to make me a class favorite.
ANGlE: What about
class favorites?
Don't you ever say
hi or hello
before you start talking?
Hi.
Hello.
Oh, Greg's only here
because he really wants
to be something. . .
Rowley!
l was just saying that
l would really like to
nail these people
because it's
so obvious that
they're only doing
these activities
to get in the yearbook.
You know, l like
your point of view.
You should sign up
for the school paper.
We're the voice
of the people.
Well, the people
are mostly idiots,
so l guess,
technically speaking,
we're the voice of the people
making fun of the people.
Thanks, but l can't
be on the paper
because l'm gonna be
in the paper a lot.
So that would be
a conflict of interest.
You're the people.
Got it.
Do you believe me now?
That girl is crazy town.
Look! They have wrestling !
That's it! l'm great
at wrestling.
l've watched it for years,
l know all the moves.
Tombstone piledriver.
Chair shot.
Vader Bomb.
AUDlENCE: Heffley! Heffley!
Heffley! Heffley!
Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!
Okay. Something
is very wrong here.
These don't look like
wrestling costumes to me.
Welcome to wrestling,
you future Olympians!
So, just to make sure
we all get off
on the right foot
and nobody gets
seriously injured,
we're gonna teach you
a few basic moves.
Remember, this is about
learning the sport
and having fun !
All right. lt's not
a competition
because everyone here
is already
a superstar to me.
Coach Brewer,
can you step over here
for a moment,
please, give me a hand?
Thanks.
(GRUNTS)
(ALL EXCLAlM)
That's known as
a speed takedown.
Nice job,
Coach Brewer.
Can you get up and
come behind me?
Put one arm
over my shoulder?
Let's go, yeah.
You got it, walk it off,
come on.
That was known
as the arm drag.
Let's give Coach Brewer
a hand, everybody!
He's fine.
Yeah, Heffley.
What about piledrivers
and Vader bombs?
That is fake wrestling.
This is real wrestling !
Let's go!
lf l have to wrestle
Benny Wells,
he'll kill me!
MALONE: Let's move! Come on !
Okay, to keep things fair,
l've divided you into weight
categories by your size,
so Rottweilers over here.
Bulldogs, you stay
right there.
And we got two
Chihuahuas. Yeah.
Nice head gear.
Thanks. My mom
let me borrow it.
All right, let's see
what you got.
(WHlSTLE BLOWS)
Don't worry, Fregley,
l'll take it easy on you.
(EXCLAlMlNG)
Hey, l wasn't ready!
Nobody's keeping score,
but that was a sweet
speed takedown, Fregley!
This is fun,
Greg Heffley!
Get off me!
ALL: (CHANTlNG)
Fregley! Fregley! Fregley!
Blow the whistle,
blow the whistle!
All right! Fregley!
Outstanding !
And let's. . .
Let's hear it
for our other winner.
Yay, Greg !
l can't lose
to Fregley again.
lf l get beat by
the weirdest kid
in school,
nobody's ever gonna let me
sit at their table.
How are you
going to beat him?
lt's like he had
superhuman strength !
l'm not gonna beat him.
l'm gonna gain
1 0 pounds this week
so l can move up to
the Bulldog weight class.
And then you and l
can wrestle each other.
Ready?
Can l throw at you now?
Later.
You're better at riding
than l am,
and l'm a better thrower.
(SlGHS)
Greg, save some
for everybody else, honey.
GREG: Can't.
l need to bulk up.
Why?
l think your body
looks beautiful
just the way it is.
l heard he got his butt
kicked at wrestling.
Now what is wrong with you?
Why would you sign up
for something
you don't have to do?
You signed up for wrestling?
Kind of.
You never sign up
for anything at school.
You fly below the radar.
That way you never raise
anyone's expectations.
Thank you, Rodrick,
for those words
of motivational wisdom,
but perhaps
a better way
to look at it is that
it's a chance
to learn to excel
at something.
Well, what could
l learn at school that
l can't teach myself?
Well, Greg, l think
it's great that
you took the initiative
to learn something new.
This is like the first step
to responsibility!
My boss's son Will
was smaller than you,
but he built himself up
with the weights!
Yeah.
We could get you
the same equipment.
You could train,
get the right
nutrition, cardio.
You'd be in tip-top shape
just like Will.
And it would only take,
like, three months.
Three months?
Yeah.
l'll just stick to eating.
Well, l don't know where
you put it, Heffley,
but you gained 1 0 pounds
and joined
the Bulldog class.
Yes.
l thought
you didn't gain
any weight this week.
My mom's
ankle weights.
All right, bulldog Heffley.
Meet your new opponent.
What? But this is
boys' wrestling.
Ever hear
of Title lX?
Her parents
threatened to sue,
so you show her
what it's like to wrestle
a real live boy.
(GRUNTS)
Come on ! What you
waiting for, huh?
Don't be such
a wuss, Heffley.
Make your move!
She's a girl !
Where do l grab her?
Stay down !
Patty, over here!
Get off of me!
Can l wrestle
somebody good now?
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
Well, look who's
in the paper.
Greg ! You're famous!
Right on the front page!
And if l would
have pinned her,
which l could have
done easily,
you know l would have
gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl.
Why does she even
want to wrestle?
Who knows?
Girls are very confusing.
Like today,
l heard someone
in the hallway say
that Bryce Anderson
has a cute butt.
What does that even mean?
A butt can't be cute.
lt's a butt.
l know, but that's what
they were saying.
l don't see why
girls our age can't talk
just like regular people.
So how are you
gonna become
a class favorite now?
Two words.
Best Dressed.
How are you
going to do that?
Fashion is easy.
You wear a shirt and a tie,
and kids are impressed.
l'm telling you,
this is gonna work.
(SlNGlNG) l light 'em up
before the motor starts
l go so fast
that l could never stop
Look under the hood
but you don't know what l got
l'm a moving violation, baby
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Ta-da!
l told you
l was wearing this.
l know!
l wanted to be matchers!
BOY: Check them out!
ALL: (SlNGlNG)
Greg and RowIey
sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes Iove...
GREG: You know,
maybe Rodrick was right
about Rowley.
Maybe l do need
a new best friend.
But l can't just ditch him.
l mean, if anybody
has a better idea,
I'd Iove to hear it.
NARRATOR: ln this school,
much like your own,
one boy is about to learn
an important lesson
about seIf-worth and esteem.
Gag me with a spoon.
That guy is so unpopular,
I'd hate to be him.
(SlGHS)
Why doesn't
anybody like me?
BROCK: Maybe because
they don't know
how awesome you really are.
Brock Branigan P.l.!
What are you doing here?
I'm here to soIve the case
of the boy who just
needed to be himseIf.
So go for it!
Show them how awesome
you really are!
Hey, guys.
Do you like break dancing?
(UPBEAT MUSlC PLAYlNG)
That is totally rad!
Wicked.
You shouId sit with us
at Iunch, friend.
Sweet!
lt really is awesome
to be me!
Thanks, Brock.
Okay. Let's talk about
what we've learned.
GREG: l don't know
about anyone else,
but I know what I Iearned.
It is awesome to be me.
The problem with Rowley is
that he's not enough like me.
I can't ditch him
'cause he'd be Iost
without me.
But maybe l can fix him.
Because that's
the kind of friend I am.
What are you doing?
Making your clothes more
middle-school friendly.
Look at this stuff.
Too babyish and weird.
Too "Why don't you
just punch me now?"
What are you,
a foreign exchange student?
Oh, man.
This one we burn.
That was a present
from my mom.
Well, then your mom
is trying to
get you killed.
Ready?
Steady. Go.
No, no, no.
You look like one of
the Seven Dwarfs.
You only need one strap.
One strap is cool.
But there's two straps.
Why would they
put on two straps
if you're only
supposed to use one?
Because the guys
who make backpacks
aren't cool.
lf they were cool,
they'd give it
one strap,
like the cool
one-strap guys do.
You know what has one strap?
Machine guns.
You know what else?
Electric guitars.
You know what else?
Purses?
But Joshie is cool.
Rowley,
Joshie is not cool.
He's a lip-synching pop star
whose fans are
eight-year-old girls.
You're just jealous
that l was the one
who discovered him.
Who are you
gonna listen to, Rowley?
Me or Joshie?
Joshie says to
respect your parents
and follow your dreams.
Then Joshie must get
beaten up a lot.
You actually almost
look as good as me.
Am l great at this
or what?
There's Bryce Anderson.
Just be cool.
Hey, Bryce.
Yeah, hey, Bryce!
Cute butt!
You're killing me,
you know that?
Look, Rowley,
tonight's Halloween,
our favorite night
of the year,
so, just promise me
you won't wear, do
or say anything weird.
(DOORBELL RlNGS)
You're kidding me, right?
(SlGHS) My mom wanted me
to be visible at night.
From space?
So, we'll hit a few houses
on the way to the North Side,
which is where we'll do
most of
our trick-or-treating.
Why are we going
all the way over there?
lt's where
the rich people live.
They hand out, like,
two, three pieces of
big candy to each kid.
Not that
candy corn crap.
l'm talking about
full-size Milky Ways
and Nutter Butters.
Plus, if we time it right,
rich people get tired
of answering their doors
and just leave the bowl out.
We can clean up.
ROWLEY: Wow, you're lucky.
My mom doesn't let me play
with makeup anymore.
Shut up, tool.
LÃ¶ded Diper's
got a gig tonight.
Mmm.
Going to
the North Side, huh?
Takes you right past
the Devil Worshiper Woods.
The Devil
Worshiper Woods?
You know about
that story, right?
Well, there used to be
this house right here
where these woods are.
They had to tear it down
because what happened there
was so terrible.
What happened there?
Well, a long time ago,
two kids who were,
l don't know,
maybe in middle school,
they trick-or-treated
at that house
on Halloween night.
But the house was full
of devil worshipers
who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens.
And they cooked them
and they ate them.
But they forgot
to turn off the ovens.
So the house burned down
with everyone in it.
How'd the trees
get there?
And then they planted trees.
Oh.
And to this day,
on Halloween night,
you can still hear
the demonic laughter
of the devil worshiper ghosts
as they roam the woods,
looking for more kids
to sacrifice!
Hey, Rodrick.
l need you to
help me out. Like. . .
(DOORBELL RlNGS)
Are you wearing eyeliner?
KlDS: Trick or treat.
Susan !
l'm on door duty!
GlRL: Thank you.
Bubby!
Mom, can you tell him
to stop calling me that?
What if somebody hears?
Then they'll know
how much he loves you.
Frank, Frank,
honey, honey,
can you go with them?
No, l can't.
l got to
guard the house
in case someone
tries to T. P. us.
They're gonna get
drenched from the roof.
(LAUGHS)
Honey, for goodness sakes,
don't do that again.
Remember what happened
last year?
l got you !
(CRYlNG)
Hi.
l thought
they were teenagers.
And l couldn't see
through the bushes.
My legs, they hurt
from the squatting.
So, that's why
l'm doing it from
the roof this year.
So l can see
when they're coming.
Can we go now?
(DOORBELL RlNGS)
Yes, go.
But stay
in the neighborhood.
KlDS: Trick or treat.
And no North Side!
We promise!
GREG: We got to stay
in this neighborhood
the rest of the night.
That guy gave me
two full-size Snickers!
Did l tell you
or did l tell you?
These people have
money to burn !
(LOUD ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG

ROWLEY: l can't believe
we got this much candy.
This is, like,
the best day ever.
CARTER: Hey, reflector dude,
nice costume!
Thanks!
My mom made it. . .
(EXCLAlMlNG)
(BOYS LAUGHlNG)
CARTER: Oh, that was awesome!
l saw your plates!
We're calling the cops!
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Run !
CARTER:
Hey, they're going

Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!
Where are we going?
We're totally exposed !
My grandma's house!
Quickly!
They're coming !
(RlNGlNG DOORBELL)
Hello?
That's not helping !
She's not home!
Bingo night.
CARTER: Okay,
you guys are dead.
ROWLEY: Open the door!
Get the key!
GREG: Okay. Okay.
ROWLEY: Open the door!
Get it!
Come on, let's get them, boys.
ROWLEY: They're coming !
ROWLEY: Now!
CARTER: Oh, l got you now!
PETE: Hey, hey!
Come on, you babies!
l'm gonna
kick your butts!
Yeah? You and what army?
Whatever.
(BOTH BABBLlNG)
You guys are so lucky
you can hide in there
behind your mommy!
No, we aren't!
lt's not our house!
lt's his grandma's
and she's not even home!
(LAUGHlNG)
What? Why would
you tell them that?
CARTER: (SOFTLY)
Did he just say that?
Oops.
Now they're
never gonna leave.
You need to
call your mom
to come get us.
Mine'll kill me
if she knows
we're here.
Mine will, too.
She thinks
you're a bad influence.
She's right.
Then we're gonna have
to bust out of here.
PETE: You have any threes?
Go fish.
(CREAKlNG)
Hey, what's that?
(DANGER! HlGH VOLTAGE PLAYING)
Danger, danger
High Voltage
(LAUGHlNG)
Danger, danger

Just back off!
l don't want to

we just want to

this ever happened.
Nobody needs to be
a hero! Whoa!
Are you kidding me?
l'm gonna rip off your arms
and punch you in the face
with your own fists!
They're gaining !
This way!
The Devil Worshiper Woods!
No way!
PETE: Hey! Stay right there!
We're gonna get you !
(PANTlNG) They're going
into the woods.
(PANTlNG) No, no way l go
into Devil Worshiper Woods.
Uh-uh.
This isn't over!
ROWLEY: l'm really scared !
Just keep running !
(ROWLEY PANTlNG)
(LOUD LAUGHTER)
ROWLEY: Did you hear that?
lt's the devil worshipers.
(LOUD LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER CONTlNUES)
(BOTH SCREAMlNG)
Guys?
Are we safe?
Yeah.
And we made it with
still a ton of candy.
Sorry. l was. . .
l thought
you were teenagers.
BOY: Maybe next year, Pops!
Hey!
(SNlFFlNG)
(GROANS)
So anyone eIse
exhibiting symptoms
of pink eye
shouId contact
the nurse immediately.
ln field trip news,
consent forms
are going out today
for our annuaI
History of Plumbing excursion.
ln sports news...
I think Shelly is looking hot today.
BOY: Yeah.
Are they
talking about me?
l don't know.
l don't speak Russian.
(TEACHER SHUSHlNG)
And finally, some positions
have opened up
for the Safety PatroI.
lf anyone is interested,
see Mr. Winsky after homeroom.
GREG: Now that's what
l'm talking about.
Safety PatroI.
The cops of middle school.
You boss people around,
report the jerks,
and miss cIass
three times a week.
MR. WlNSKY: Safety Patrol
is a sacred trust.
When you put on this vest
and that badge you become
a protector of the weak.
You become
an enforcer of the laws
of this school,
because today's litterer
and jaywalker
is tomorrow's
window breaker
and graffiti vandal,
and it's our job
to stop it.
So l ask you,
are you up for the job?
Yes!
Yes!
Then welcome
to Safety Patrol.
Just remember,
with great power. . .
Whoa.
. . .comes
great responsibility.
Now, you get
your first assignment
just after lunch,
so you'll be excused
from the first 20 minutes
of sixth period.
But that means
we'll miss Algebra. . .
Ouch !
Do we get
free stuff?
Free hot cocoa.
Could this day
get any better?
Whoa, is that cocoa?
Sorry, Safety
Patrol only.
Sorry.
You rejected
the school paper,
but you joined
the Safety Patrol?
Look, are you working
your way down
the evolutionary ladder?
What?
Look, Safety Patrol
is the lowest of the low,
the geekiest of the geeky,
the lsland of Misfit Toys.
You're just jealous
they don't trust you
to keep our school safe.
Now if you'll excuse me,
l need to
secure the perimeter.
GlRL: l'm hungry.
GREG: Keep it
straight, people.
Single-file line,
one by one.
(ROCK MUSlC BLARlNG
ON CAR RADlO)
Greg ! lt's those guys
from Halloween !
What do we do?
Come on, man,
just pull my finger.
l swear to God,
l'm not gonna
do anything.
Everybody,
shoulder to shoulder.
Shoulder to shoulder.
GREG: Go. Go!
Whoa, whoa.
That was close.
Too close.
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
GREG: lt's times like these
that make me reaIize
Rowley's pretty lucky
to have me as a friend.
ROWLEY: And l got
Twisted Wizard Two,
and a new bike!
And we're going to take
a family trip to New York City
for New Year's Eve!
What did you get?
My dad got me
a weight-lifting set.
Do you know
how many video games
l could've gotten instead?
l had to get out of there
before he expected me
to, like, use it.
Anyway, let's play
some Twisted Wizard Two
at your house.
Probably not a good idea.
My dad's
still annoyed at you.
For what?
Remember that secret language
we made up last week?
Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa
like-pa a woman-pa.
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
l think
he cracked our code.
We should probably
do something outside.
Why can't you ride
and l throw
at you first?
My legs kind of hurt
from walking over here.
(SlGHS)
(SCREAMlNG)
(GRUNTS)
Okay, Rowley.
Come on. Get up.
(ROWLEY GROANlNG)
Shake it off.
Are you sure
the doctor was right?
lt really didn't look
that broken to me.
Yeah, it's broken.
The X-ray never lies.
Oh, my gosh.
What happened?
l broke it.
SHELLY: How?
Big Wheel accident.
You're funny.
Can l sign your cast?
Me, too.
l wanna sign it, too.
Why, sure.
Hey, l'm the one
who broke his hand.
Then you're a jerk.
(WHlSPERS) Sorry.
GlRL: Does it hurt?
(EXCLAlMS)
SHELLY:
Rowley, you're so funny.
After l stood. . .
GREG: l couldn't believe it!
Rowley was eating
at an actuaI tabIe
because of something l did!
Where's my credit?
And he's right handed!
He can feed himself just fine.
So, how's that
class favorite thing
working out for you?
Great.
(WHOOPlNG)
I reaIized
Rowley's injury thing
was a pretty good racket.
(SCHOOL BELL RlNGlNG)
MARLEY: lt's gonna be
so much fun.
Hey, guys.
Check it out.
Oh, my gosh,
what happened?
lt's a raging infection
caused by a splinter
that was left untreated.
Want to be the first to sign
my sympathy sheet?
No.
l'll sign it, Greg Heffley,
if you'd let me
look at your infection.
ROWLEY: And on the X-ray,
you could see where the bone
just snapped right in half.
l had the exact
same break last year,
and it got all purple!
ROWLEY: Cool !
Mine, too!
Hey, Gregory,
want to sign the card?
You got
Rowley a card?
What? No, it's for
Bryan Little.
You know, the guy who writes
the Wacky Dawg cartoons
for the school paper?
He has mono
and he's going to be out
for three months.
That really stinks.
So, just out of curiosity,
who's gonna do the cartoon?
They're having tryouts,
but the important thing
is Bryan gets better.
Absolutely.
GREG:
Bryan Little getting mono
was destiny.
I draw cartoons aII the time.
l'm gonna win this.
l decided to go ahead
and forgive Rowley for milking
the broken hand so hard
and I toId him
he couId work on the cartoon
with me.
So, l was thinking
we could do
something like this!
Oops, I stepped
in a puddle!
At Ieast it's not
an acid puddle.
Oy, oy, oy!
lt is an acid puddle!
Zoo-wee Mama!
lt's the same joke
every time.
Yeah ! Zoo-wee Mama!
We can't just do
the same thing
over and over.
We can if it's
Zoo-wee Mama.
lt has to be
a little more
sophisticated.
GREG: (lMlTATES CRElGHTON)
I wonder what is in
this cute IittIe box.
GREG: (lMlTATES
CRElGHTON'S FRlEND)
It's not a box,
it's a brick,
you dumb moron.
GREG: (lMlTATES CRElGHTON)
Oops! I've been
trying to open it all day!
Can he say,
"Zoo-wee Mama"?
No, it's not funny.
Well, l think it is.
l like Zoo-wee Mama.
You know what?
lf you like it so much,
then why don't
you go do it yourself?
Okay. l will.
See you.
(SCHOOL BELL RlNGlNG)
Hey, l forgot my raincoat,
so l'm gonna need you to
walk the kids home today.
l can't. l can't
get my cast wet.
You can borrow
my coat.
GlRL: Where's Rowley?
He couldn't
get his cast wet!
He walks us better!
Oh, no.
Oh, my gosh !
Space monsters!
They're going to eat us,
unless we can
get into that hole!
Come on, people, move it!
Now, people!
We're gonna get eaten !
Come on ! Don't worry!
l'm right behind you !
Whoa!
Go!
Hey!
Rowley Jefferson,
is that you?
Yes, Mrs. lrvine!
Sorry, kids!
Are you going to
eat us?
And though doctors assure us
that Mrs. Cheznik
is no longer contagious,
the cafeteria nachos bar
wiII be cIosed
for the remainder of the week.
And now, what you've all
been waiting for.
The facuIty, Student CounciI
and editors have aII met
and seIected
the new cartoonist
for the school paper.
And the winner is
"Zoo-wee Mama"
by Rowley Jefferson!
(ALL CHEERlNG)
What?
That is funny!
BOY: Great job.
Zoo-wee Mama.
GREG: l couldn't believe it.
Am l the only one
who gets comedy?
Rowley, will you
put me
in your cartoon?
Sure.
And me, too.
l want to be the one
who says, "Zoo-wee Mama."
You got it!
Hey, Rowley,
congratulations.
Thanks.
No problem.
You know, l read
all the submissions and yours
was by far the best.
l read yours, too.
BRYCE: Hey, Rowley.
Hey, Bryce.
Yeah, hey, Bryce.
Hey, fella.
Wow. Everyone knows me now.
lt's like l'm famous!
lsn't this great?
Yeah.
Rowley Jefferson?
l need to see you
in my office, now.
(SCHOOL BELL RlNGlNG)
MR. WlNSKY: l just took a call
from a Mrs. lrvine
about what happened
to the kindergarteners
last week.
She was very upset.
And so am l.
What?
You violated
the sacred trust.
This. . .
This badge is supposed
to mean something,
and you just spat on it.
l can barely even
look at you.
l really don't. . .
Just save it.
You are officially suspended
from Safety Patrol.
And l expect a full apology
to the kindergarteners.
Yes, sir.
Hey. What did
he have to say?
l'm kicked off.
l don't even know
what he's talking about.
Rowley?
What?
Nothing.
You've been home for an hour
and haven't badgered me
for any snacks.
Are you feeling okay?
Well, l'm kind of
in a tough situation.
l know something
and if l tell
the truth about it,
it could hurt somebody.
But if l don't,
it could hurt
somebody else.
Well, you have to
trust your gut and
try to do the right thing,
because it's our choices
that make us who we are.
Okay.
GREG: l was up all night,
tossing and turning,
thinking about
my mom's advice.
And l finally decided
to do the right thing.
l'm sorry
l terrorized you, children.
What?
l decided to let Rowley
take one for the team.
But l'm not entirely sure
that was the right call.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, l was pretty upset
about being suspended
from Safety Patrol,
but then l just started
drawing a bunch
of Zoo-wee Mamas
and l felt better.
Look. l put you
in this week's cartoon.
And you even get to say,
"Zoo-wee Mama."
Wow. That's really
nice.
So, listen.
lt's kind of funny, you know,
the whole Safety Patrol thing.
Yeah?
Ready for the funny part?
Well, l'm the one
who terrorized those kids!
What?
Yeah,
and l think we can both
learn some valuable lessons
from this.
Like, l should be more careful
what l do in front of
Mrs. lrvine's house.
And you, well,
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to.
You know what, Greg?
You're not
a good friend.
Whoa. How could
you even say that?
l'm a great friend.
lf you were a great friend,
you would have told
Mr. Winsky the truth.
Okay, one thing.
You can't get mad
about just. . .
You only care
about yourself.
You hated my cartoon.
You made fun of my clothes.
You disrespected Joshie.
You broke my hand
and you didn't even
seem sorry.
That broken hand
was the best thing
that ever happened to you !
Don't call me.
Don't come by my house.
We're done.
l thought the whole thing
wouId bIow over.
But Rowley was still giving me
the siIent treatment.
Even when I tried to
make the first move.
Yeah.
So, anyway, l was
so angry at him,
l didn't know what to say.
MR. WlNSKY:
One of the kindergarteners
finally told their parents
the whole story.
Greg? You're relieved
of your Safety Patrol duties,
effective immediately.
Rowley,
for showing dignity
under false suspicion,
l am promoting you
to team captain.
Now, that's a position
that l held for two years.
l know you'll honor it.
(YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE MY FRlEND PLAYING)
Okay
You're supposed to
be my friend
We're supposed to get along
Hey, you're supposed to
be my friend
Hey, Rowley, my mom says
it's okay for me
to sleep over tonight.
Awesome!
GREG: The whole thing
with Rowley is, l was willing
to let bygones be bygones.
But then he made friends
with CoIIin
just to mess with me.
As if I even care if he...
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.
There's no
going back, Sergeant.
l need to board
the helicopter.
Do you have my back?
l will always
have your back, Captain.
Yeah, maybe l'll meet up
with some friends
Yeah, maybe l'll meet up
with some dogs
'Cause you're supposed to be
You're supposed to be
Supposed to be my friend
You're supposed to
be my friend now
Hey.

So, l was thinking
maybe you might
want to have a sleepover?
Yeah. With who?
Me.
Yeah, when?
Now.
Greg Heffley,
l love you !
We are going to be
best friends forever!
Wanna have
a tickle fight?
Okay.
Let's get inside.
FREGLEY: l can't believe it!
Greg Heffley's in my room !
Greg Heffley's

What do you want to do,
Greg Heffley?
How about Twister?
GREG: l'm not really
that much of a Twister guy.
Candy!
Wait!
No, no, no!
Fregley, come on ! Really!
l really think
we should save those
for later!
Maybe we should
go outside and. . .
My mom doesn't
let me have sugar.
She says high glucose
in my diet
induces hyperactivity.
But it's so good !
Greg Heffley, you want
to jumpety-jump?
Yeah, you know
what, Fregley?
l just remembered,
l have an appointment,
a really important
appointment.
lt's a homework appointment.
Yeah, and l really
should be going.
Get away from me!

Greg? Greg?
(BANGlNG ON DOOR)
l hear you breathing,

FREGLEY: Dear Gregory
l'm very sorry l chased you
with a booger on my finger.
Here, l put it on this paper
so you can get me back.
What?
All right.
GREG: Okay, enough.
l'll show Rowley
I don't need him.
When he sees me
in the yearbook
as Most TaIented,
he's gonna come running back.
Okay, since there are
so many of you
here auditioning,
to save time,
we're gonna do a group sing
of one of my favorite songs.
Please refer to the lyrics
on this handout.
l will pick out
the best voices
and place you accordingly.

l'm stunned !
Maybe you should be Dorothy!
No, no, l can't be. . .
No!
Greg Heffley was suspended
from the school
Safety Patrol !
How can you trust him
with the lead role
in the play?
He can't be Dorothy!
l'm Dorothy!
All right, Patty,
calm down.
l'm Dorothy! l am !
My mother

She can ruin your life!
Just an idea.

All right, well, Greg,
your voice is too high for
any of the other male roles.
Perhaps you can be a tree!
A tree?
No way.
(SCOFFS)
(WHlSPERS) The trees
get to throw apples
at Patty Farrell.
Haven't you
seen the movie?
(PATTY BLOWlNG KlSSES)
Wait, we don't
get arm holes?
How are we gonna throw apples
at Dorothy without arm holes?
You don't need arm holes
because nobody's
throwing any apples.
We're not doing the movie.
ln my version,
the trees sing.

l think you should go.
l think
it'd be a lot of fun.
GREG: Fun?
That's the exact opposite
of fun!
This entire year
has been terribIe
and nobody even cares!
My family, my best friend.
WeII, I'm sick of it.
Somebody needs to pay.
Okay, Manny, l'm putting
this Tootsie Roll
in Rodrick's backpack.
lt's for Rodrick,
so whatever you do,
don't touch the Tootsie Roll.
Mmm-hmm.
Greg? Coaster.
Where's he. . .
Manny?
Where did you get that?
Oh, my.
That's offensive.
(PLAYlNG HEAVY METAL MUSlC)
Rodrick? Rodrick!
l need to talk to you
inside! Now!
Go ahead and talk.
We're a band
and we have no secrets.
Okay, fine.
What is this?
lt's not mine.
lt was in your backpack.
No, it was in my room.
(EXCLAlMS)
Does owning this magazine
make you a better person?
No.
Did it make you
more popular at school?
(LAUGHlNG) Yes!
No.
How do you feel
about having owned
this type of magazine?
Ashamed !
BAND MATE: Nice.
Hmm.
Do you have anything
you wanna say to women
for having owned
this offensive magazine?
l'm sorry, women.
Yeah, women.
Yeah.
You're grounded
for two weeks.
Okay, settle down, Susan !
l think one week is plenty!
Make it four weeks
and l'm gonna need
the keys to your van !
My van?
Yeah ! Yeah.
Yeah.
ROWLEY: Hello?
HeIIo?
(LE FREAK PLAYlNG)
PHOTOGRAPHER:
All right, smile.
Look at this place!
Wanna dance?
Mom, stop dancing.
You're embarrassing me.
Come on.
l'm just keeping time
to the music.
l'm begging you,
please stop it.
Okay, okay, okay.
Thanks, honey.
Hi !
Well, if we're
not here to dance,
maybe you should
go talk to Rowley.
l think it's time
you two made up.
l can't.
Sweetheart,
he's your best friend.
And sometimes,
when somebody's worth it,
you just have to
put yourself out there.
l wouldn't know
what to say.
Well, l could go
for an ice cream
after the dance.
Maybe you could
invite him to join us.
Yeah.
Hey, Rowley.
Hey.
So you want to go
get some ice cream after?
l'm sorry.
We already have plans.
Yeah. We do.
Oh, fine.
My mom wanted me to ask.
So l did.
l didn't even want to go.
Well?
Honey, l'm sorry.
(lNTERGALACTlC PLAYlNG)
Yeah !
(SlNGlNG) Well, now,
don't you tell me to smile
You stick around
l'll make it worth your while
Got numbers
beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because
I'm so versatiIe
StyIe profiIe, I said
lt always brings me back
when I hear, Ooh, ChiId
From the Hudson River
out to the NiIe
I run the marathon
till the very last mile
lf you battle me
I wiII reviIe
People always say
my style is wild
You've got gall,
you've got guile
To step to me,
l'm a rapophile
lf you want to battle,
you're in denial
Coming from Uranus
to check my style
Go ahead,
put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exiIe
GREG: You have
got to be kidding me.
BOY: Hey, what's up?
GlRL: Hey.
Hey.
So, l left
my racing game
at your house
and Collin's
sleeping over tonight.
So l need it back.
What? No way.
Finders, keepers.
You didn't find it,
l left it.
Fine, then leavers, losers.
That's not even
a real thing.
lt is if l say it is.
lt's my game.
Do you know what?
You wouldn't even
have that game
if l hadn't told you about it.
You wouldn't have
half the stuff
you have without me.
Yeah, like
a broken hand !
That was
a million years ago.
ROWLEY: lt clicks now!
Hear that?
Click, click,
click, click.
And it's all
your fault!
lt was an accident!
Kick his butt,
Rowley! lt's easy.
Guys, Greg and Rowley
are gonna fight.
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
PATTY: Come on,
what's wrong with you guys?
Start punching !
You start.
You start it.
No, you !
Quit copying me!
This has got to be
the worst fight ever!
Do something !
(ALL EXCLAlM)
Well, well, well.
Look who we have here.
You're so
freaking dead.
All you guys better scram
or l'm gonna
kick your butts, too!
(ALL SCREAMlNG)
Not you two.
You guys have no idea
what l'm gonna do to you.
Oh, um. . .
What are we gonna do?
l don't know.
We need to move this along.
My shift at Cinnabon
starts in half an hour.
l know what we're gonna do.
Give me the wide one.
That's you,
let's go.
Pick it up.
But. . .
Pick it up.
Now eat it.
No!
Eat it or l'll shove
the entire thing
down your throat.
(GAGGlNG)
GREG: l don't even want to say
exactly what happened
because if Rowley ever tries
to run for President
and someone finds out
what these guys made him do,
he won't have a chance.
PETE: Now you.
But l'm allergic
to dairy!
l'll die, and then
you'll go to jail ! And. . .
MALONE: Hey!
What are you doing
on school property?
WADE: Go, go, go!
CARTER: Shotgun !
Pete Hosey,
is that you?
You boys okay?
Yeah? All right.
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Oh, my God.
Rowley Jefferson ate. . .
l ate the cheese!
Yeah. l ate it.
And you know
what, people?
l just did
you all a huge favor.
l ate the cheese
to show you all how stupid
this whole school is.
The wrong friends.
The wrong lunch table.
The wrong butt?
lt's all meaningless.
Just like this cheese.
l know it.
You all know it.
So come on.
Everyone else
who's sick of it,
step forward and join me!
Cheese Touch !
Greg Heffley
has the Cheese Touch !
ALL: Run !
BOY: He's got
the Cheese Touch !
Not bad, Heffley.
Not bad at all.
So you want to
come over
after school and
play?
Yeah.
Okay.
(lNDlSTlNCT CHATTERlNG)
PATTY: Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.
Thanks!
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.
Thanks, Patty.
Here's your yearbook.
You're not in it that much.
Maybe try to get out there
a little next year.
You know what, Patty?
One day middle school will end
and become high school.
And after that,
it just becomes life.
And all those things
you think are important now
won't be anymore.
(SCOFFS) You wish.
(EXCLAlMlNG) As if!
Handing it to you
is like touching you
and l am way too smart
to touch somebody
who ate the cheese.
Rowley!
Have a great summer!
Stay cool.
Yep, you're way too smart
for me, Patty Farrell.
(SCOFFS)
(LAUGHlNG)
So the year
turned out pretty good.
My goal was to be
a class favorite,
and l made it.
Even if it wasn't exactly
the way l planned it.
Zoo-wee Mama!
(WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME
PLAYlNG)
Hey! Oh!
I don't wanna
waste my time again
By getting wasted
with so-caIIed friends
'Cause they don't know me
But they pretend to be
part of my social scenery
Hey, maybe l'm a critic,
a cynic
Or am I jaded
or am I afraid of it?
'Cause It's dragging me down
lt's bumming me out
lt's making my head spin
round and round
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right,
what do you want from me?
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right,

l say jump
and you start jumping
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right,
what do you want from me?
Just another day
in the Iife of me
It's 3:00 am,
and l can't sleep
Maybe l'm a critic, a cynic
Or am I crazy?
Do they all hate me?
'Cause they pick me up
and throw me down
lt's making my head spin
round and round
(EXCLAlMS)
Can you say, "Hey?"
