If only that moment...
If...
only that moment, I...
If...
only that moment, Nazuna...
Nazuna!
Today is Moshimo Shrine's festival and fireworks display.
If only...
Do I have to swim, too?
Norimichi-kun
Fireworks, Should We See It from the Side or the Bottom?
Norimichi, hurry up get out!
Even though this is vacation, do not skip, you know.
Noisy, this is still out, know.
For breakfast is left-over curry from last night.
Stop it.
Next, we'll give you news about local weather.
Katsuma-san at Moshimo's temple.
Hello, good morning.
Right now, I at Moshimo's temple, place for fireworks display for tonight.
For today weather, the circumstances are very bright and clear.
No noticeable changes until tonight...
It's so annoying.
Why do I have to enter?
You're still no good.
Huh? Why?
I and dad won't be here till afternoon.
Have lunch with whatever there in the fridge, okay.
Stop it.
Where are you two going?
She collected the wasted trash to sell at flea market.
At the festival today?
Who's going to go there?
I will bored to dead till wait the shop close.
Did you say something?
I'm going!
Dad, if you don't like it, just say it.
Yo!
Yo!
What's the wager today?
The loser will have to sexually harass Miura-sensei!
Seriously you guys.
I'm serious!
It's bad.
Riding the bicycles is still relaxing.
Shortcut.
Seriously?
Not fair.
Wait, Norimichi.
I won't lose.
Crossing.
Ah, noisy.
Wait for me!
Wait for me, guys!
Please don't make a fuse.
You're slow!
Alright!
Damn!
Minoru, can you do it?
You already know that I can't do it, right?
Maybe you can.
Just try it.
Good morning.
Mornin'.
Good morning.
Morning.
Sensei, good morning.
Yes, good morning.
They're jiggling today as well!
D? E?
F? G?
H? I?
Here!
J?
J...
Junichi...
By the way, what you say?
Nice receive!
Nice!
If it world competition, you will win.
You right.
Then, when going out...
That thing...
Good morning, Nazuna.
About what we talk yesterday...
Hey.
It boring, right?
Isn't Nazuna cute?
O-Oikawa?
Which part?
Well, I will confess to her.
Just do it.
I wonder where I'd want to go with her this summer vacation.
Like going to the fireworks display.
Like I say, just confess already.
There's no way I will do it.
What will I do if I'm turned down.
It'll be embarrassing, you know.
Like I care.
Okay, take a seat.
Today is Moshimo Shrine's festival and fireworks display.
I think there will be a lot of people there.
If you go with your friends, make sure you're not late.
Sensei, who are you going with?
Isn't it with your boyfriend?
Tajima-kun...
You should stop responding with your sexually harassing answers.
Then, I will respond back with my strong sexually harassment.
You're really need to stop doing that!
Oh no, she come here.
Hey, get down.
Hey!
Hey, there is teacher that waiting there!
What you say?!
There is someone that waiting about the shrine.
Get down already!
Oh, no.
Geez...
What happened today?
The students are asking me if I'm going out with someone.
Seriously?
I see.
Maybe it's time for us announce it.
Stop that.
That time, we both drunk and-
Sensei.
Yes?
Ah, Oikawa-san.
What's wrong?
What is this?
Mama...
My mother told me to give this to you.
Eh, moving away?
Eh? Oikawa?
Not to say, it's between the summer vacation too.
For real?
It's very sudden too.
Oh, her mom is getting married again.
How should I say...
It's hard to react to this kind of situation.
You're right.
I wonder if it okay?
That is the privilege of having pool cleaning duty, right?
You bet.
Is she also on duty today?
No, it's just us, right?
Ah, the swimming club.
Are there any club activities today?
Dunno.
Well...
I'm off to the toilet.
Huh, why?
After seeing Nazuna, I feel like taking a dump.
You're not making any sense.
Club activities?
Nope.
Then, swimming?
I don't.
Then, why?
I wonder why.
Oi.
What is it?
Dragonfly...
On your face.
Take it.
Catch it.
What is that?
Ah, I picked it up at beach this morning.
A stone or a glass?
I don't know.
But for some reason,
it's just so pretty.
The poop won't come out.
Ah, I see.
Say, let's do a 50-meter race.
Oh, let's do it.
Do we wager something?
What you think?
Then, ah, if I win, gimme the latest volume of One Piece.
Oh, good.
Then, what about you?
The, if I win,
I will confess to Nazuna.
What's with that?
Not fair, you're cunning bastard!
I'm just kidding.
You don't want Nazuna to be taken away from you, right?
Huh, what do you mean?
What?
50 meter?
I want to join.
Do we have to wager something?
Ah, well...
That right.
Then, if I win, please listen to whatever I say.
What do you mean by that?
Isn't it fine?
The, let's start.
Get ready...
Start!
What?
Azumi-kun, will you go to the fireworks display today?
Let's go together.
Why?
How do I put it...
Because I love you.
I will get you at 5 in front of your house,
please don't go anywhere.
It hurt.
I hit my feet so hard.
Who won?
Give it back.
That's mine.
It's round.
No, it's flat.
There's no doubt it's round.
Then, think about it,
the fireworks exploding, you know.
It's clearly that the shape is round.
Say, do you think if fireworks are seen from the side, won't they look round or are they flat?
What's this about?
Rocket fireworks?
No.
It's about the big fireworks.
Aren't they flat?
Hey, you see?
Cut the crap.
They're always round.
What about you, Yuusuke?
I don't know.
You guys are all idiots.
The wire fireworks were round, right?
About the big fireworks, we don't know yet.
Then, have you guys ever seen a flat fireworks before?
I have.
See.
Somehow, we can't count on Minoru's words.
I'm serious.
Last year I saw a flat fireworks from my gramp's house garden.
From there, gramps also said that the view was bad.
See, if gramps say so,
then no mistake at all.
Your gramps is just senile.
No, he's not.
Then, let's cast a vote.
Alright.
That's not the problem here.
Who's chose flat?
Me.
Then, let's make a bet.
What you gonna to bet?
Well, if they're flat,
you have to do all of our summer homework.
Oh, that sounds nice.
Let's do it.
Then what if they're round?
I will get a flash of Miura-sensei's panties for you.
But how to get it?
I will get it.
How?
But,
how can we see the fireworks from the side?
Helicopter?
That's easy.
Here, from the Moshimo Lighthouse.
Isn't it located just right beside the coast.
The fireworks will be lit on this Moshimo Island.
That means you can see the fireworks from the side, right?
Oh, I see.
Eh? Then, who'll go?
I'll go.
Why don't we all go.
Ah, then I will go too.
Let's go, let's go.
Won't be more interesting that way?
Then, let's go.
With this., let's have a fun summer vacation.
Yay!
It's not for fun.
What about you, Norimichi?
Eh, I wonder what should I do...
Let's tag along! Aren't we buddies?
Then, let's meet at the shrine at 5.
Yeah!
Okay.
Say,
will you really take the panties flash?
Oh, this is bad.
It will be fun.
See you at 5.
That guy... Why is he so high-spirited?
Who knows?
Ouch.
You startled me.
Oh.
Don't "oh" me.
Why are you even here?!
You're so careless.
The back door is always open.
Even so, you can't just barge in as you wish.
Isn't fine?
Either way, you're free until 5, right?
It is such a coincidence.
I'm also free.
That's not the problem.
That's already dead.
I'm home.
Welcome home.
You should say your greetings properly.
Huh, you still in?
Today was so hot, wasn't it?
Since I'd bought some ice-cream, let's all eat it together.
Which one do you want, Nazuna-chan?
Nazuna?
I'm sorry.
It's okay, don't worry.
How's her school?
Have you take care of the formalities?
Yes. Today I've told her homeroom teacher.
But, won't it be lonely to be separated from her friends?
No, that kid doesn't have many friends.
Don't worry about it.
What about her boyfriend?
Like she has one...
You never know, about girls nowadays.
You're so sly.
So lame.
Oh. It's already 5 o'clock.
Isn't it okay if we're a little bit late?
By the way,
about the fireworks, aren't they always round?
Eh? Is that so?
Yeah, they are.
Eh? Are you serious?
Nope, well... Um...
Are you an idiot?
Where in the world would flat fireworks even exits?
When the fireworks light, no matter where you see it from, aren't they always round?
I see.
But, if they are flat, what will you do?
Like that will ever happen.
The, why didn't you say it earlier?
Huh?
I just did it so I can go with this bunch.
Seriously?
Yeah. It's flat.
I thought so too.
Sorry for the wait.
Oh.
Eh, what wrong with you?
What's with that getup?
Don't I look like an adventure?
What is it?
Ah, that right.
Kazuhiro, the fireworks surely are flat.
Huh?
Let's welcome an active fireworks master who will answer anything.
It's fireworks master saying so, then no mistaking it.
Ouch!
It's hurt, you know.
Uwah, it's better if you go see a doctor through.
It's not a big deal.
We still don't know, right?
If it turns out to be tetanus, you might dead.
Is that so?
Go to my house and
ask my father to examine it.
I'll will tell Junichi and the others.
Eh, no, let's go together.
I will be late for the meet-up.
Just go.
Damn.
One more thing.
Huh?
If Nazuna is there, please tell her that I can't go.
Huh, what's that about?
Somehow, she invited me to go to the fireworks display.
When?
A while ago.
A while ago?
At the pool.
Isn't it okay to go?
Don't you like her?
Huh? What are you talking about?
There's no way I like her.
When did I say such a thing?
Haven't you been saying all the time?!
Huh? How?
Like you like her, and you wanna confess to her.
It's a gag!
There's no way I will like that ugly girl.
Are you idiot?
Ah, so helpless.
Umm...
Yes?
Is Azumi-kun here?
Yuusuke-kun?
I don't think he's back yet.
Maybe he went to the fireworks display?
Is that so?
Hey, where did you buy it?
It's not a problem, right.
Oi.
Sorry for the wait.
Eh?
Where's Norimichi?
Ah, he's bit injured, so I told him to get it checked with my father.
Well then, let's drop in and get Norimichi.
Dash.
Oi.
Not a problem.
Kazuhiro, you're slow.
Walk like always.
One more chuuhai, please.
It is okay if you don't go?
Eh?
Fireworks display.
Is it okay to say such nonsense?
Eh?
About the fireworks being flat.
Who even said such a thing?
Ex-cu...
Excuse me, I came here referred by Yuusuke-kun, but...
Tetanus?
It's not minor with that amount of injury.
Ouch.
Please don't move.
By the way, where did Yuusuke go?
Maybe to the fireworks display.
Geez...
What fireworks display?
He's all about playing. That's why I sent him to a private school.
Is a firework round, or is it flat?
Ah, no. It's nothing.
Then, for the time being, wait here for your medicine.
Okay.
Are you waiting for Yuusuke?
He won't come.
Ah, I see.
If it...
If it were you that I invited, what would you do?
I guess, you would run away?
I wanted to invited those who won.
I suddenly thought of that.
I thought that you would win.
Why did you lose?
It's because you're fast.
And I can't keep up with you.
Then, it's my fault?
Was it is my fault?
Say, what's that?
What?
That.
What do you think of this?
I don't know.
I ran away from home.
Are you serious?
Yes.
I will go away from this town.
You're kidding, right?
That right, I'm kidding.
Huh? Which is it?
I wonder which.
Why? I thought that you would win.
Did you know that?
Nazuna!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Let me go!
No!
Stop it!
Let me go!
I said stop!
Let me go!
Norimichi-kun!
Save me!
No, I don't want to go!
I won't go!
Oi! What happened?!
Is that Nazuna?
Did something happened?
It's that too bad?
Her mom is so scary.
What's with her?
It's too dangerous.
I never seen Nazuna like that.
Ah, you right.
Is her mother always whack her.
Physical punishment?
Don't know.
Stop it!
Enough!
What the hell are you doing?!
That time...
If I...
If only I had won that race...
That time...
Oi, Norimichi!
Why did you do that?!
Damn it!
If only I...
What?
50 meter race?
I will do it too.
If it's my win, please listen to whatever I say.
If only...
I...
had won that race.
That time...
What is it?
Norimichi-kun, will you go to the fireworks display today?
Eh?
Let's go together.
Why?
How do it put it...
Uwahh, stop it.
I will get you at 5 in front of your house.
Please don't go anywhere.
I feel like taking a dump midway.
Eh, where is Nazuna?
It's round.
No, it's flat.
There's no doubt it's round.
Then, think about it,
the fireworks exploding, you know.
It's clearly that the shape is round.
Say, do you think if fireworks are seen from the side, won't they look round or are they flat?
What's this about?
Rocket fireworks?
No.
It's about the big fireworks.
Aren't they flat?
Hey, you see?
Cut the crap.
They're always round.
What about you, Norimichi?
I don't know.
Then, have you guys ever seen a flat fireworks before?
I have.
See.
Somehow, we can't count on Minoru's words.
I'm serious.
Last year I saw a flat fireworks from my gramp's house garden.
From there, gramps also said that the view was bad.
See, if gramps say so,
then no mistake at all.
Then, let's make a bet.
Alright.
What you gonna to bet?
Well, if they're flat, you have to do all of our summer homework.
Oh, that sounds nice.
What about you, Norimichi?
Norimichi, let's go home.
Ah... okay.
See you at 5.
Yo.
Don't "yo" me.
What's up with you?
You're so careless.
The back door is always open.
But, you can't just barge in as you wish!
How's her school?
Have you take care of the formalities?
Yes. Today I've told her homeroom teacher.
But, won't it be lonely to be separated from her friends?
No, that kid doesn't have many friends.
Don't worry about it.
What about her boyfriend?
Like she has one...
You never know, about girls nowadays.
Oikawa?
Ah, no, it seems I can't go with her.
Nah, I had a promise with Yuusuke and others too.
I can't break my promise between men.
Hey, what if I don't go to the shrine.
Eh?
About fireworks,
whether it's round or flat, isn't it okay?
Let's just see it normaly on the beach.
Ah... Yes...
Besides,
isn't it always flat from the beginning?
Eh, really?
That right.
Are you seriously say that?
Ah, like that.
Hey, fireworks explosion blow like this, you know.
If you see it from side,
wouldn't it be flat?
Ah, I see.
So, we don't need to bother ourselves to go to the lighthouse.
Let's just not go.
Well then...
I think you're right.
Ah, that's already dead.
Really?
Ah, then...
I'll go buy something to drink.
Eh, seriously?
Thanks.
Well, then I want something carbonated.
Okay, okay.
What's wrong?
Yuusuke is here.
Then,
you won't go?
Not like that...
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Let's me think first.
Norimichi.
I thought we should go together.
I'll come down now.
Or I'll feel bad for everyone.
About that...
What will you do?
Get on!
Eh?
Just hurry up.
Eh?
Nazuna?
Why?
That shit...
Ow!
Hey!
Eh?
Where are we going?
I don't know.
What's with that?
You're so late!
Shut up.
Huh? What are you getting mad at?
I'm not mad!
What we gonna do now?
Eh?
Won't you go?
To see fireworks.
Are you want to go?
Then, you...
Ah, this?
It all mess up.
Say,
where should we go?
Tokyo?
Osaka?
Anywhere is good.
You're running away?
Am I right?
You're running away from home, aren't you?
I'm not running away from home.
Then, what is it?
It's a kakeochi.
Kakeochi = run away secretly with one's beloved, usually to get married.
Kakeochi is...
Where you die together?
It's "shinjuu".
shinjuu = lover suicide
So tiring...
Say, let's rest for a bit.
Are you kidding me?
Weren't you the one who asked us to go?
I can't go anymore.
By the way, what did you put in that bag?
What are these?
Are you intending to set up a shop?
Hey!
Eh?
Hurry up or we won't make it.
What's wrong with him?
Wherever girls go, I think they can work.
They just have to lie that,
they're 16 years old.
They will know.
Is that so?
Besides, where will you work?
At a night market?
Cabaret club?
Girls Bar?
It's impossible, right?
How does it looks?
My sixteen-years-old self?
Here, see this.
I picked this up at the beach this morning.
What's that?
I don't know,
but somehow...
When I found this, I decided that
I will leave.
No...
If Norimichi-kun wins...
Right.
If Norimichi-kun won the race, I had decide to leave the house.
That's right.
So, take responsibility.
Eh?
Would you like to come with me?
Nazuna!
Eh?
Hey, stop it!
Let's me go!
Stop it!
No!
Norimichi-kun!
Save me!
I said stop!
Let's me go!
Hey!
Save me!
Norimichi-kun...
Norimichi-kun...
Norimichi-kun...
Norimichi-kun...!
What?
What's wrong with you?
Norimichi-kun!
That time...
If only I...
If I were to board the train with Nazuna...
What if...
Norimichi?
Norimichi, right?
Oi, what are you doing over there?
By the way, why didn't you come to the shrine?
Ah, um...
I had to do something...
Well,
why didn't you just go after it was finished?
Eh? Ah, yeah...
Well, whatever.
Anyway, let's go to the lighthouse.
By the way, whether or not the fireworks are round or flat, I don't even care anymore.
Me too.
You've got to be kidding me.
Why did we walk so far to get here, then?
What about Nazuna?
Eh?
Where did she head off to?
I mean, why did she show up at your house?
Well...
That's, at the pool...
What is it?
No, I can't properly explain, but...
That...
Eh?
Are you two going out?
We're not!
Then, what is it?!
Erm, that's...
You're really annoying.
We finally arrive!
Which is it?
Round or flat?
They're still ascending, you know.
But, it's already proven that they're round.
If they're flat, you'll really have to do all our homework.
Ah.
Huh?
It's open.
Whoa, amazing.
Are we climbing this?
If we don't, then how will we see it from the top?
Oh, fine, let's go!
Have we arrival yet?
There are so many flights of stairs.
It's ascended.
Which is it?
As I said, it's definitely round.
When summer vacation ends, I'll confess.
Eh?
I will absolutely
say that I like her.
It so high.
What you gonna to do?
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Wow, it high.
Which one?
Round or flat?
See, it is flat.
Yeah!
Why?
Gramps, thank you.
We did it!
Yeah!
We win!
This can't be happening.
All my homeworks, done!
Easy.
It's absolutely weird for fireworks to be flat.
By the way, aren't fireworks always round?
Eh? Is that so?
That's right.
Eh? You're seriously saying that?
Nope, well... um...
Are you an idiot?
Where in the world would flat fireworks exits?
Firework explosives, no matter where you see it from, they're always round.
I see.
But,
if it were flat, what would you do?
Like that will ever happen.
It's as you've said.
Eh?
This thing can't be happening.
Yuusuke.
Huh?
I'll...
Get Nazuna back
If only...
Me and Nazuna were...
To get on that train!
Wherever girls go, I think they can work.
They just have to lie that, they're 16 years old.
How does it looks?
My sixteen-years-old self?
I picked this up at the beach this morning.
I don't know,
I decided that...
If Norimichi-kun won the race, I had decide to leave the house.
So, take responsibility.
Huh?
Res-pon-sibi-lity.
Eh?!
Would you like to come with me?
Nazuna...
What?
What's wrong with you?
Wait...
Let's go.
Eh?
Stop there!
Nazuna...
Ah, that was fun.
That was amazing, Norimichi-kun.
You know how to fight.
I was wrong about you.
Nah, it just a lucky.
By the way, who is that man?
Mama...
want to married again.
It was great, right?
Marriage...
For the third time.
The first husband, that have been divorced with her was my dad.
But, when I still in the worm...
My mom "kakeochi" and came to this city.
Like drama in the television.
That's why, I was daughter of couple that "kakeochi".
Amazing, right?
But, my dad has disappeared.
But, not even 1 year pass,
but my mom has got a new man.
Unbelievable.
Because of that, you want to run away?
We have already do it, right?
Run away sound like child play,
so can you stop saying it?
Ka-
ke-
o-
chi.
We are "kakeochi".
Bad blood of my mom running into my vein.
What will we gonna do?
Let's go to the Tokyo and live together.
Eh?!
If we can't work at night club, what will we gonna do?
Maybe try into entertainment business?
Are you want to became idol or what?
Impossible, right.
I think we maybe can live like that.
Eh?
yoake no konai yoru wa nai sa
"There's no night that doesn't have a sunrise,"
anata ga potsuri iu
You say, standing there alone
What was that?
Song that my mom always sung when she karaoke.
Sing by Matsuda Seiko.
When I was young, my mom always sing it to me, so that why I remember.
yoake no konai yoru wa nai sa

Our azure planet, Earth
I already know.
I can't run and can't "kakeochi".
But, before I been transfer to another school,
just for today,
I want been with Norimichi-kun.
That?
Azumi-kun?
Eh?
This is bad!
Eh, that was Norimichi?
Nazuna is also with him, right?
Eh, what's that mean, Yuusuke?
Why did they're together?
They're going out together?
Damn!
Wait, where did you thinking you're going?
Wait!
Eh, wait a minute.
They knows.
They saw me with you.
Why?
Shouldn't we still low?
Ah, not that what I mean.
Because, Yuusuke like you.
Wait!
Huh? They chasing us!
Huh?
Nazuna!
Nazuna, wait a second!
Wow, Mama?!
Eh?
What should we do?
Let's get off!
Eh?
We will get off at the next station
Nazuna!
This ways.
Norimichi!
What's going on?
What should we do?
Jump.
Eh?
Hey!
Where are we going?
I don't know!
What's with that?
But,
Eh?

If only...
If only you will go...
I only want be with you today.
That?
Yeah?
Shimada-kun, Oikawa-san?
Good evening.
Good evening...
Wow···
Wow...
Just as I thought, you two is couple.
We're not!
Please wait a while.
Wait, what are you all doing?
Research about shape of fireworks is it round or flat!
Huh?
Nazuna!
What is this about?
Eh?
Is Haruka's breast is this small and flat?
What's you doing? Pervert!
Hey, Narimichi-kun.
Is fireworks shape round or flat?
Huh?
That what you talking about with everyone in the class, right?
Of course, it's round.
Is that so?
Absolutely.
No way...
What is it?
Beautiful.
Nazuna.
Yeah?
No.
This world is wrong.
What's it?
Fireworks can't been seen like this.
That's not a problem.
Eh?
Even if it round or flat,
even if it shaped weird like this.
If I can been with you together,
I don't even care about this.
Eh...
There're they.
Norimichi, what are you doing?!
I found the door.
This ways, hurry up.
Nazuna!
Nazuna, please get down here!
What should we do?
If only...
Huh?
If only Yuusuke and your mom don't find us...
Can we be alone together?
Throw it.
Norimichi!
Damn, you!
Let's go to the Tokyo and live together.
Huh?
If we can't work at night club, what will we gonna do?
Maybe try into entertainment business?
Are you want to became idol or what?
Impossible, right.
I think we maybe can live like that.
yoake no konai yoru wa nai sa
"There's no night that doesn't have a sunrise,"
anata ga potsuri iu
You say, standing there alone
toudai no tatsu no misaki de
You looked out at the dark ocean
kurai umi wo mite ita
On the cape where a lighthouse stood
nayanda hi mo aru kanashimi ni
I've worried some days
kujikesou na toki mo
And sometimes I felt crushed by my sadness
anata ga soko ni ita kara
But because I had you at my side
ikite korareta
I lived through it
Is we not there, yet?
By the way, if it round or flat, it is not important, right?
Shut up, hurry up move.
Eh, what wrong?
As I thought.
What is "as I thought", huh?
Mama...
What should we do?
They maybe will waiting at the next station.
I think it is okay.
Eh?
Eh?
Why are it running over the sea?
What's with that marble?
What?
The marble that you always carry with you.
Marble that I throw at the lighthouse.
I don't know.
Maybe, that marble is,
will grand all you wish,
what are you going to use it for?
That's impossible.
It if only "maybe".
By the way, I really throw it at that time.
When?
After school.
You were at home, have been caught and have been force to go home.
Huh?
I thrown it at that time.
What are you talking about?
Don't you remember?
Don't know.
When it happen?
Today.
Today?
At evening.
Right now is evening.
No that what I mean.
Today, have been to many repeat of day.
Don't you remember?
I don't know what do you mean.
The moment I throw that marble, I...
Do you believe it?
Maybe not, no one gonna believe this bull shit.
Really, I lose the race to Yuusuke.
And then you invited Yuusuke to see the fireworks display.
I don't want to go with Azumi-kun.
It is impossible.
But you invited Yuusuke, not me.
But, Yuusuke broken the promise.
Then you were caught by your mom.
At that time, I pick up that marble,
and throw as fast as possible.
I thought, if only I can beat Yuusuke...
Then the surrounding become "guaw", or something like that.
Guaw?
"Guaw" like that...
"Guniwauwau" like that...
You say the weird word.
Shut up!
Even so, when I wake up, I was already at the pool.
But this time, I win and you invited me...
Maybe you can't believe story like this...
I believe.
Eh?
If you say so, then I believe.
I know this is maybe impossible.
But, if...
I have to leave this town,
only for today I want be with you.
We have back.
Let's go.
Eh?
This or this.
It seen in this world, to many thing that still unknowns.
Well then, this is the world that you create.
I don't know...
I only hope and it all have been like this.
It's really weird, right.
Weird, huh?
If only...
If only I...
throw that marble once again while wish for us to back to the real world.
what is going to happen?
You will return, right?
If that is the case, you...
will go far away, right?
If I do it,
I won't ever seen you again...
I don't want that way!
If that so, it more better if I still in this weird world,
together with you!
In this world, only you and me!
Hey, do you want to swim?
Let's swim.
Let's go.
Are you really want to swim?
Did you say that you want to swim?
Oi, are you seriously want to swim?
Hey, what wrong?
Eh?
Oi...
Nazuna!
Oi!
Please don't do anything crazy.
Hey, Norimichi-kun.
What is it?
When will we able to see each other again?
Nazuna!
Damn it!
Even through, today is festival,
but why we have to keep working?
Why, the fireworks ball can be here?
Damn it! Who is drop it?
For fireworks worker, to drop fireworks ball here is not got at all.
Well, I have light it!
What?
Say it.
I think if Nazuna...
Huh?
Huh...
Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
I'll be near you
Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
I'll be near you
I in love with Nazuna!
Some people handle love and never try
I also in love with Nazuna!
I really, really love her since the ceremony!
I can almost fly with your wings to set me higher
Don't joke around, you bastard!
I wasn't joke around!
Miura-sensei, I love you!
Some day we'll see the world
Mizuki-ojisan, I love you!
And through the grey have faith in our hands
I just tired of listen to it!
It's not a problem, right?
I was he grandchild.
Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
We'll always be forever friends
Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
I'll believe you
When the river flows
Off to part us both
Only heaven knows
I'll be a boat to sail around you
Melody never say goodbye
I'll be near you
Some people handle love and never try
I can almost fly with your wings to set me higher
One day we'll see the world
And through the grey have faith in our hands
Till the river ends...
When we see each other again,
what kind of world it will be?
I'm looking forward.
