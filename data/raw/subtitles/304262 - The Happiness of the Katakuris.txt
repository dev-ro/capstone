Yummy! Let's eat
My uvula!
Asshole!
Go go go!
Got ya!
I hit it, Pochi! Fetch!
Around then I started to wonder,
What makes a happy family?
We say family but each is an individual.
With their own dreams and problems.
It's said that nature and
nurture influence how we grow up.
With my family, I know I'll
grow up to be really cool.
You made fun of my divorce.
Did not.
You did, just now.
Did not
Did so
Don't push!
Grandpa was a department
store shoes salesman.
Working hard, planning his retirement.
Stop, you two! Act your age!
Then, just like that, he was laid off.
When he was really down, someone told him.
They're going to build a major road.
When it's done, tourists will flock here!
Sold on the idea, he bought this place.
And practically forced us all
to run it as a guest house.
Hey
He and Grandma Terue
met and married at work.
Sometimes, for the sake of
her husband or children.
an ordinary housewife can
do the most unexpected things.
Ouch! No wonder you divorced.
It's not like I wanted to either!
Shizue!
Idiot!
Before I was even born,
mom was back with her folks.
Then the whole family moved here.
But mom's still waiting for romance.
Uncle Masayuki worked at a stock company.
It's a long story, but he got canned.
He's got a short fuse and goes mad sometimes
Asshole! Jerk!
Look at great grandpa, proof that
it pays to live an easy life.
I hit him! Pochi, Pochi!
Incredible!
Peak season and not even
a stray cat's come by.
We should never have done it!
Masayuki!
What are you saying!
The sky's blue.
The stars are plentiful, the air's so pure!
I can't do it. I'm leaving.
Hey, wait.
Don't say that.
After coming all the way.
To this wonderful place.
We've worked hard expecting guests.
Someone better show up.
You'll pick up the first
handsome guy who comes.
How dare you, you short-ass ex-con!
Stop it!
Goody-two-shoes.
Stop it!
I've had it!
I bake cakes, I clean and still no guests.
They'll come.
I'm sure they'll come if we keep this up.
I'm doing nothing until they come.
Masayuki! Shizue! That's enough!
They'll come. I'm sure.
It's wonderful here, look.
The magnificent guest house.
Even got a swing.
You fixed it?
Go on, sit on it.
You have to come here to appreciate it.
The swing feels so good.
It's great. Guests are bound to come.
They'll come. They've arrived.
Hello there.
Welcome.
Hiking?
Some tea on the terrace?
Help!
I'm scared of the darkness.
Why did you come here?
Excuse us.
We're on a spiritualist training trip.
Don't mind us.
Spiritualists have training trips too?
I wonder.
I knew they weren't guests.
People really do come this far.

Thank you god.
Let's eat.
What looks good?
It's not the season for stews, is it?
Stews are great for leftovers.
If you don't like it, don't eat it.
It'll give you energy.
Full of goodness.
That's why sumo wrestlers eat it.
What happened to the deer's body?
Its body?
Well...
Once it happened.
Some guy with a rifle, not grandpa.
Bang bang bang!
Shot it and ate the body.
Did I spit something out?
A pickled plum?
Spit!
Ah, the spit.
Ok, Ok.
You saw it?
The body's in the wall.
Buried in the wall.
Masayuki.
It's not dead.
Well, if you think so, it's probably not
Now, eat some tofu, blow on it.
The other day, he took 5 hours
to fix a hole in the wall.
Dad?
This place is everything to him.
Dad likes tofu, so leave him some.
Not you Yurie.
So it's not dead.
At one Karuizawa guest house.
Cute little animals help
out carrying luggage.
Serving coffee and doing other chores.
This cute animal service became famous.
And all the rooms are booked up.
From now until next year.
It all started when
the guest house's owner
Mr. Sukeyoshi Honnoura
Put the animals to work
Along with his family.
To cut labor costs.
Look, a bug.
The pigs thought, it's either
work or become sausages.
So now they carry bags,
And serve coffee.
And that's why...
They work like mad.
It's not coming out.
...The animals...
Leave it, don't change the channel.
Oh, let's see that.
Isn't that actress the same age as you mom?
Look at the state of her.
A blackout?
Mom
White Lovers' Guest House
What is it?
What are you surprised about?
You scared us to death.
Idiot!
Idiot?
Hey.
Someone's outside.
A guest.
Want a room?
Thank you.
Would you care for any dinner?
Uh, just a beer.
We'll bring it up to your room.
Breakast is from 7:30 to 9:00
in the dinning room
Checkout is 10am.
Your room is upstairs.
Uh, sir.
My underwear...Please use it, if you like.
Enjoy your stay.
Enjoy your stay.
And when I get there, it's a dead end.
Darkness creeps up in wispy shadows.
Even the slightest warmth.
Deserts me, it hurts me.
Even the tears I cry are dry.
At least smile when you go.
Sayonara.
Your beer, sir.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
Squid guts?
Tomorrow.
Yes?
If you were going to die tomorrow...
Huh?
If the world was to end...
What would you do tonight?
Masayuki, it's your turn to mop.
Well.
I'm off.
See you.
Take care.
I will.
Hey, Shizue.
That really suits you.
Thank you.
As always.
Well she likes it.
Shouldn't we wake up the guest now?
You're right.
Good morning.
Breakfast is ready.
Uh, excuse me, sir?
Sir? Sir!
Masayuki.
Get the key.
Dad!
Suicide?
Is that our key?
Oh my god
Dad!
My god.
Should we call the police, dear?
Calm down.
Calm down.
Where's the will?
He brought a knife.
Why didn't he use it?
Probably too desperate.
Why?
Why did he have to die?
Why did it in our guest house?
Where's the will?
At least leave a will, you bastard.
A will. A will.
Come on. You must have a will.
Why'd you have to die here!
There's something written on it.
A peach?
A wallet. He had a wallet.
Maybe there's something in it.
His wallet!
Not here.
Nor here.
What are you looking at me for?
We haven't said anything.
But you're looking at me like that.
You used to collect wallets.
That was long ago.
You think I killed him for his wallet?
No one's said that.
You might as well have.
Masayuki.
What?
Bring some plastic sheet and rope.
Just do as I say.
We really should notify the police.
Don't! Hold on.
Say the police let it out that our
first guest committed suicide.
Nobody will ever come to stay here!
If I lose this, I don't know what I'll do!
This is the end for me.
Just look...Does it look
like a regular suicide?
Look at it.
Masayuki.
Bring the plastic sheet and rope.
Maybe it's better, if we stop this, Masao?
I had nothing to do with it.
It has to be done for everyone's sake.
What in the world...
Are you doing?
My time will come soon too.
But I pray I don't see you lot there.
On my own, I remember.
The days when I was in love.
La la la, la vie en rose.
La la la, my unruly heart.
La la la, just one more time.
La la la, even though.
It hurts.
Cast your magic love spell on me.
Cast your magic love spell on me.
Yurie.
Yes.
Would you be happy,
if a new papa arrived?
I love you
A bug?
the feeling of love.
The wonderful moment that comes to all.
When god whispers I love you.
In the busiest moment, a feeling of joy.
No more pain.
Just longing to hear your voice.
Desire.
All I need are your words.
The magic of love envelops me.
When you fall in love.
Everything shines brighter.
When God sings I love you.
These long nights I sleep alone.
At twilight, I wait for you,
it's all so delightfully.
Heartrending.
I want to hold your smiling face.
I'm so thankful I fell in love.
The magic of love envelops me.
Are you a serviceman?
I'm with the U.S. Navy.
To be more precise, Britain's Royal Navy.
Really?Your Japanese is excellent.
Yes, my father was Japanese.
Are you here on duty?
Yesterday...I took up my post in Morioka.
I wanted a break so I came here.
I'm happy.I could meet someone like you.
What an adorable little girl.
Your husband, I envy him.
Actually, I'm single.
Dad had an affair with a highschool girl.
Well, just between you and me.
I'm also a British secret agent.
By order of Queen Elizabeth.
Give me your cell phone number.
Cell phones are out of range here.
I'll be here.
My name is Shizue Katakuri.
I almost forgot
the most important thing.
I'm Richard Sagawa.
Richard Sagawa?
Who is it?
A few more days passed
without any arrivals.
But no one said a word.
Let's go.
Ah, this looks delicious, see.
Look, mm, oh yes.
How are the soba noodles?
Masao, you have to eat something.
Delicious!
You have to eat to keep your strength up
This is good. Really good
How can it be so good?
Maybe cos I'm hungry.
Maybe the dog wants some?
Hey, this is really good.
You want the fermented beans too?
You gourmet.
Pochi! Pochi!
Hey, know what this is?
Do you know what that is?
What is it, then?
Good, eh?
Rough! You got it.
Right! You got it.
Why?
Why? Well, how do dogs bark?
Ruff!
And what's he eating?
Noodles.
So, ruff noodles!
I'm done.
Huh?
Keep going.
Wow. Our first star guest
Wasn't he on Athlete's Singing Contest?
This is your room.
We've found a really nice place.
No one will find us.
Darling.
Still suspicious?
Aren't you?
Me?
How many times has he deceived us?
He was the last one to see the guy,
when he took up the beer.
The guy's wallet is missing.
If the police come in
and start investigating.
His past would come out,
complicating everything.
But he's such an honest, gentle soul.
You said you'd disowned him,
but when he came back from jail.
YOU said, Let's all work together
for the guest house.
It's only natural!
When his only son is hurt,
What father wouldn't lend a helping hand?
See, you two are exactly alike.
He's too nice, that's why he's popular.
Just like you.
Hello, White...
Hello?
Yes?
Yes...
It's hard to hear you.
Shizue?
Hold on a minute.
Go over there.
Yes?
Shizue?
Yes, me, Richard.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
I am currently flying over lraq.
This call is being bounced
via Yokota Airbase in Japan.
Yokota?
Look out!
Be careful! I'll be waiting.
Seen like this.
He looks even bigger.
He's inflating
Where's the girl?
She's disappeared.
Maybe she ran off.
P-police.
What?
We have to call the police.
There's no need.
What are you doing?
Masayuki! Sheet and rope!
We should call the police...this won't work.
We can't get him through the hall.
Maybe lower him down from here?
Chop up?
What do you think?
Do you realize what you're about to do?
Let's not.
It could expose the other one.
What?
Not over!
Just do as I say.
How come we only get guests like this!
What's the deal with these dead bodies!
Listen!
We must save our guest house.
You're crazy.
Guest house, bullshit!
This place has no future.
Masayuki! Stop it.
I started this
so we could all work together.
I'm not going to let this ruin it.
You always say for everyone's sake.
But your selfishness
dragged us all up here.
Don't you feel any responsibility?
I didn't drag you here.
You don't know my dreams,
how dare you!
If you want to leave, then go.
Masao!
Stop!
There's no going back.
Nonsense, idiot!
Masayuki! Apologize!
Asshole! I have thought about it!
We have to do this for everyone's sake!
If you're going to do it, do it fast!
You got an idea?
This one's stiffer and
heavier than he looks.
Popped out!
She's buried underneath!
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
See?
What's going on?
Why's this happening to us?
Why do you all come out here to die?
What's wrong with you?
Anyone home?
This is Officer Miyake.
Hello?
Mr. Katakuri of the
White Lovers' Guest House?
Be right there!
You go!
I'm Officer Miyake.
Welcome.
To our remote area.
I just came up the mountain on my bike.
Thank you.
With a little one too!
Well well.
I'm Officer Miyake.
Would you fill out this form please.
I will.
Thank you.
Er...
Yes?
Um...
Shizue.
Truth is...
She had a very difficult birth...
But thankfully recovered.
Hurry up and fill it out.
A difficult birth, eh?
She's popped out!
A guest?
- Yes! - No!
What was that noise?
We were just about to tidy up.
Who should do what...
Something fell over.
How many guests have you had?
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have asked.
But some people like these quiet places.
Yeah, can't complain.
It's great to see a family pulling together.
Oh, there's this too.
A wanted poster.
I'll leave it here.
Thank you
Pochi?
That's your dog?
Yes.
Well, goodbye.
Thank you, bye
Keep it up!
This'll do.
I've never done anything like this before
Hey, he's massive!
Ok.
Shizue!
Yes!
Dad!
What?
It's not like he's breakable.
The poor thing.
Hello?
Are you from the guest house?
Yes.
Do you have any cake?
Can we get something to eat?
Yes!
Ordinary people.
They're ordinary people.
[Really] ordinary.
Mom, mom...where's the sugar?
In the cupboard.
Ok, hold this.
Hurry! Hurry!
Grandpa, you've got
something on your face!
That's alright, I'll eat it.
Here you go.
It's all home made.
Please. Here's the sugar.
Enjoy!
Under one roof and sky,
laughing and sleeping...
My dream of living together.
If you want to go, just go.
When you get lonely, just come back.
Let's live here.
Let's start here.
In this new place.
There's a big new road coming.
Will it bring happiness?
Happiness is made by all.
That's right. By the whole family.
Let's live here. Start here together.
On this road to happiness and health.
Let's live here. Start here together.
On this road to happiness and health.
Let's live here. Start together here.
On this road to happiness and health.
Let's live here. Start together here.
On this road to happiness and health.
What?
Is that so?
Thank you.
Near the lake.
Yes.
We've been praying for a big road.
We're jumping for joy.
Yes, thank you.
Don't do that!
What is it?
That road construction.
That date isn't decided yet.
But they're digging
the whole lake area.
So.
We have to move them.
Richard
I think about you everyday.
What are you up to?
I was on the phone.
Someone was making an inquiry.
Welcome home.
I'm so happy that you're safe.
I missed you.
Are you thirsty? A drink.
Or something to eat?
I want to eat you.
Stinks of disinfectant
2,21 2 YEN!
How lucky!
After shampooing, I cut my hair.
Maybe I messed up.
We should have marked the location.
When did you make this?
Just now.
You planned to put it here?
