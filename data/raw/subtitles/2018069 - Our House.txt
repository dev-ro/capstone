Listen, I have been fixing
this stereo
since before you were born.
Okay. Move. Move.
Let me get back there before you
blow someone's eardrums.
These guys are coming.
On my way.
Oh, shit!
Mommy, you didn't change
the calendar yet?
Oh! Well, I was waiting for you
to help me. Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
- One, two, big jump!
Oh-ho-ho.
Go for it.
Perfect.
Your, ah, your ideas definitely
gave us a head-start but
you know,
it feels good to be..
kind of doing our own thing.
See anything?
No. Just proof you guys haven't
dusted in about ten years.
Mom says you have to
set the table.
Yeah, after this level.
Your sister will play for you.
Or do you want me to?
I'm coming!
Hey, Dag.
- You know how to play?
- Nope.
Ah!
Dinner bell!
- That should do it.
- What you don't want to..
You don't want to test it first?
No. We're good.
I suppose you're gonna
wanna gloat now.
No, I don't do this
for the recognition.
It's enough for me
that you know.
I can hold my breath under water
for 30 seconds.
- No way.
- Are you kidding me?
But her goal
is an entire minute.
Then you can perform
underwater heists.
A minute,
which her teacher thinks
she's gonna be able to do
by this spring.
Are you guys staying over
till tomorrow, Ethan?
Oh, I wish. We actually
have to head out in a little bit
and get the lab ready
for tonight.
Uh, what's tonight.
Well, with the kind of
energy draw
that we need for the project,
the only safe place
that we can really do it
is at the A.I. lab
which is conveniently
empty tonight.
What about my swim lesson?
Can we have a moment?
- Ethan?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
Listen, I get why you're upset
but please try to understand
where I'm coming from here.
We were just looking forward
to having you home.
Okay. But I'm only an hour away.
It's not like I'm...
We haven't seen you in months.
Months.
Okay. Well, I can..
I'll try to be better
about that. It's just..
I mean, you know
how I get when I...
What about your Aunt Susan?
Who's gonna pick her up
tomorrow?
Ah, I don't know.
You guys gotta figure something
else out, I guess.
You need to get
your priorities straight.
That's exactly
what I'm doing, Dad.
Trust me, classes are over
on the 12th.
And then you guys have me
for the rest of spring break.
But tonight,
you've gotta let me go.
I mean, this is the first chance
we've really had
to test this thing out.
- Please.
- Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. I guess
you better go then.
Thank you for understanding.
Uh, I think
we're gonna head out.
- Don't go yet.
- Mom, thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, don't go, Ethan.
See you guys soon, okay?
- I'm sorry.
- You're welcome. It's okay.
We'll see you soon.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No, it's my fault, too.
Hey.
Let's do this.
Hey, tonight's the night,
huh, Lightman?
Keep walking.
Break a leg, bitches.
- Where's the shunt motor?
- The other case.
Careful. Careful.
We call it ELI. Short for
Electromagnetic Induction.
Imagine a world where
your phone never dies
or appliances
come without plugs.
You know,
we have wireless internet
so, why not
wireless electricity.
Our method should have
wireless electricity
in every home within
a decade.
I mean, the same basic
principle we've built upon
has been around
for quite some time
but it's never been
successfully implemented
until tonight.
Here we go.
Signal's looking good.
Starting at 100 RPM.
Come on.
Should something be happening?
Just give it a second.
Come on.
Are you sure the bulb works?
Yes, I'm sure.
Give it a minute.
The signal's all over
the place.
Alright.
Do it..
Now!
- These readings are all wrong.
- What is going on?
Boosting the signal.
Come on. Come on.
Wait.
Do you hear that?
Come on.
Ethan, be careful.
Ethan!
Oh, shit!
Ethan, we've gotta go.
Shit! Shit!
Blackout is campus-wide.
Please respond to building B.
I hope we don't
get in trouble.
- What happened?
- I've no idea.
Okay.
Time to go.
- You see anything?
- I think we're clear.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Can't take a break?
Well, um, not right now.
I have to figure this out.
Stop obsessing.
I'm not obsessed.
What are you doing?
Mean.
Well, figure it out later.
I want to figure it out now.
Let's do something fun.
Okay.
Let's make a tent.
- A tent?
- Yeah.
Alright.
What? One second.
Oh, weird.
- Hello?
- Ethan.
You gotta come home.
There was an accident.
- Yeah. Hold on.
- A truck..
I don't know, a truck crashed
right in front of Mom and Dad.
What.. What..
W... what do you mean?
Matt!
Okay!
Matt, come on.
I mean it!
I need caffeine.
Let's go!
Come on!
The bus is leaving.
Here we go.
I'm in gear.
And, ah, if you have any
problems with it
just let me know.
- All good?
- Yeah.
Just a quarter-inch splitter.
- This came in for you today.
- Oh, thanks.
Oh, thanks.
- See ya!
- Bye, Matt!
See ya!
- Hey.
- What's this?
Nothin'.
Just a part for work.
- School good?
- Yup.
And will he help you
with your homework tonight?
Okay, make sure
you ask him, okay?
- Okay. Bye, Ms. Nash.
- Okay.
Okay. Bye, Becca.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey. Ready to go?
- Yeah.
- Alright.
Ah, can I talk to you
for a minute, Mr. Lightman...
- Ethan's fine.
- Okay.
I just wanted to talk to you
about Becca.
Uh, yeah.
What about Becca?
It's just that lately
she seems to be
having some trouble interacting
with the other children.
Look, I just want to help.
Oh, we don't need it.
But thank you.
Ethan!
Hey, Tom.
How're you doing?
I'm alright.
How've you been?
I haven't
seen you around much.
Yeah. They're keepin' me pretty
busy at the power plant.
Yeah.
You guys holdin' up okay?
Uh, yeah. You know, it's..
It's been a..
- It's been rough, but..
- Yeah.
I think we're hanging in there.
But, uh, I should probably
get back to them.
Sure, alright.
Hey.. Hey, listen.
When Karen died a while back,
everybody always said
"You'll get over it."
That's, that's the lie
that people will tell you.
But, uh, it gets better.
I promise.
Anyway, you guys need anything,
you, uh, just let me know, okay?
Yeah, we will.
- Alright, well, um..
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Alright.
- I'll see you later.
- Uh-huh.
Why was Ms. Nash sad?
What do you mean?
When you talked to her,
she looked sad.
That's 'cause I wasn't
very nice to her.
You should be nice.
I like her.
Matt!
Okay.
- Have a good day.
- You got it?
Don't forget your bag.
- Bye.
- See ya.
Okay.
Don't forget, um,
you've got to..
You've got to go to
your sister's swim practice.
I'm going to pick you both up
there later today, alright?
- Please don't forget.
- Okay.
Please don't touch
my leg next time.
Just say "Okay".
- Okay?
- Okay.
Come on.
- Ah, what's...
- This happened before.
I got it.
- There..
- Perfect. Alright.
Uh, you're all set.
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.
- Is everything okay, Ethan?
- Yeah. Sorry, just, um..
Why don't you head home?
Get some down time.
No, I'm fine really. I..
I need the hours,
so I'll stick around.
Are you serious?
It's not even noon yet.
Tuesdays are dead anyway.
Alright.
Ugh..
Hey, Matt.
Milady.
How was school?
Good.
Ready?
Set.
Come on, come on, come on..
Yes.
Just come on,
come on, come on..
No!
Agh!
Okay.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Guys, I am so, so sorry.
- How was swim practice?
- Good.
You know, I thought
we'd maybe switch it up tonight.
Maybe make something
for dinner, huh?
How's that sound?
- Can I help?
- Sure you can. Yeah.
That's not how Mom does it.
Okay. Well, then,
what's next?
Too much.
Hey, Matt, can you grab some
sodas from the garage, please?
I want a Doctor Pepper.
Did you hear that?
Then I looked back, and she was
still half the pool away.
What?
That's amazing.
My coach says
I might be part mermaid.
You never know. You could start
growing a tail or something.
Matt, I already apologized,
I don't know what else
you want me to say.
How about apologizing
for why you were late?
Becca, why don't you
give us a second?
You can finish your dinner
in front of the TV if you want.
Okay.
How can you go back to working
on that thing?
This is important to me, Matt.
I'm not just doing this
for me, Matt, okay?
Everyone's gonna want this
technology, okay.
This could really
change things for us.
It did change things. Okay?
- Mom and Dad are dead.
- It was an accident.
They wouldn't have been driving
if you didn't leave
to work on that machine.
Are you saying you,
you preferred
if I died, is that it?
No! You wouldn't have!
Okay, they died
because the truck
crashed right in front
of them.
If... if they'd left earlier,
or later, they'd have been fine.
- You can't know that, Matt!
- Yes, I can!
There's no possible way
you could have left
the exact same time
gone the exact same way,
and... and at the exact speed.
It's impossible. If you'd
stayed, we'd all be here.
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.
Alright, bath time, Bec.
Just wash up and then bed.
I'll meet you in your room to
tell you a story or something.
You mean your room.
Well, you can't sleep
on my floor forever, you know.
Tonight, I can though, right?
Yeah.
Okay, tonight you can.
Aw, jeez.
Hey, Marie.
I saw your light
and I thought
you and the kids might want
a little home cooking.
- Anytime.
- Ethan!
Okay. That's my cue.
Um, I gotta go.
- Goodnight.
- Thank you for this.
Goodnight.
What happened?
You okay?
Quit spying on me, Matt!
Are you spying on her?
Oh yeah, I was spying on her.
- I saw you, Matt!
- Okay.
Come out of there.
Let's go get ready for bed.
"But still, others say
the queen kept it"
"to remind herself
of her son's wisdom."
"Still, he couldn't find
a real princess."
Come on.
Please.
Stupid!
Goddammit!
Matt, I'm supposed to be the one
to change the calendar.
Don't look at me.
Well, somebody changed it.
Good morning.
Morning.
Excuse me.
Look, there's Tom.
Oh.
Hey.
More parts for your project?
I wanna see your project.
Yeah?
Okay.
So... imagine walking
in the house
and right away the phone
in your... in your pocket
starts charging.
Or, or powering a light bulb
without a socket.
That's what this machine does
or will be able to do.
It's wireless electricity.
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.
I know.
But how does it work?
Well, we gotta turn it on first.
Do you wanna do it?
Okay.
So just press those two buttons
at the same time.
- These two?
- Yeah. Just like that.
Good. Now this one.
Good. Now, there's one more.
Let me do this.
Um... press that yellow one
for me.
- This one?
- Um-hmm.
Okay, last bit.
Here we go.
Does it work?
Well, yeah.
It's not... it's gonna work.
Very, very soon.
Very, very soon.
I'm calling back later.
Alright. Well, I think
it's time for bed.
You can help me with this
tomorrow, though. I promise.
- Okay.
- Lots of work to be done.
Okay.
Hey, it's me again.
Um, I hope you're also
doing okay.
If there's anything you need,
please let me know.
I'm here for you, and you don't
have to go through this alone.
I'm here whenever you're ready.
That was the play at my school
last year.
This year it's same.
You have to be
in grade four to do it.
Hi, Matt.
Hey... hey, Bec.
Who were you talking to?
Just Mom.
I'm telling her
about the school.
You were talking to Mom?
Maybe.
What do you mean?
Did you see something?
No. Just... playin' around.
Okay. Cool.
Don't... don't stay up
too late, okay?
I won't.
I'll tell you more later.
I love you too.
But when can I tell them?
Ethan!
- Hmm? Oh.
- It's like 7:30!
What?
Oh. Did you eat anything yet?
No, I... I..
Okay, well,
there's not really time now.
Can you just, uh,
just go get dressed?
Is... is... is Becca awake?
I don't know. Can you just
check on her, please?
- Did you change this?
- Um-umm.
- Alright. Go, go, go, go.
- Bye.
Sorry
- Hi, Ms. Nash.
- Hi.
Good thing Ms. Nash loves me.
Are you alright?
You look kinda pale,
like you might be getting sick?
Okay.
Last night, I was
in Mom and Dad's room..
...and..
...I felt something weird.
And then I saw something.
Well, what?
What did... what'd you see?
I think I saw Mom and Dad.
And it... it wasn't just my
imagination or whatever, okay?
I know..
Weird things have
been happening in the house.
Like, last night,
I... I swear to God
there was somebody in my room.
And the date on Mom's calendar
keeps changing by itself.
How do you explain that?
Alright, Matt, Matt,
just stop it, okay?
You can't live in that house
and tell me you don't feel them.
Mom and Dad are still here.
I... I think the minute
you turned on that machine..
Have you ever thought
it might be giving out
some sort of signal?
Yeah! I know it's..
I know it's giving out
a signal, alright?
I'm glad you didn't say any
of this in front of your sister.
You would have scared
the shit out of her.
Becca told me she was talking
to Mom last night..
...right after I saw them!
I think Mom and Dad
are trying to tell us something.
Don't you think
you should listen this time?
Just got to school, Matt.
Weird.
Becca, did you move
Dad's toolbox?
No!
- See you later, Lightman.
- Oh, yeah. Peace.
I wanna sleep in
my room tonight.
Okay.
So, what brought this on?
I'm not scared anymore.
They watch me while I sleep.
Hey.
- What did you say to her?
- What?
Why'd you put that stuff
into her head about Mom and Dad?
What are you talking about?
She brought that up to me.
Matt, don't lie
to me, alright!
If you didn't say anything,
why is she
suddenly sleeping
in her own room?
Isn't that a good thing?
That she's deluded?
No, Matt, it's not!
Ethan, she's not deluded!
Jesus, when are you
gonna wake up and realize..
Mom and Dad don't like it
when you fight.
Ethan, don't be so hard
on your brother.
Sorry, Bec. Yeah, we'll try
to be more quiet, okay?
Just go back to bed.
...are amazing.
What would you expect to pay
for this fine piece
of exercise equipment?
Coming up after the break,
we got "Six In A Row."
Those who believe
in the holy spirit
shall find the path
of righteousness.
It's Mom and Dad.
Now do you believe us?
It's Mom and Dad.
Oh.
Oh!
What happened?
Nothing.
Just dropped something.
It's really good to see you.
Sorry I haven't called.
It's just been nuts.
You know, I drive a mini-van now
and go to PTA meetings.
It's pretty ridiculous.
But, uh, I actually
I wanted to talk to you
about our machine..
...about ELI.
What about it?
Well, I figured since we
practically made it together
you're the only other person
that knows
the technology as well as I do.
You know, our focus was always
on trying to get enough power.
But I think we took for granted
that the signal actually worked.
Well, if you don't
have a signal
you don't have anything.
We... well,
I think it does work.
Just not on light bulbs.
Like, when you feel a presence
or... or when someone says
they see a spirit
and they have
a physical reaction to it
like the hairs on their arm
pricking up
or on the back of their neck.
What if there is a scientific
explanation for that?
Like, a shift in the
electromagnetic energy levels?
Matt, Ethan told us not to turn
it on without his permission.
Well, Ethan's not here.
I'm in charge.
That's not how you do it.
You know our consciousness
has a frequency
so, where does all
that energy go when we die?
I know this sounds crazy.
But, Hannah, there's...
there's stuff
going on in my house, okay?
Stuff that I cannot explain.
It all started
when I turned on the machine.
Ethan, listen to me.
You have to talk
to someone about this.
Look, I came here to have
a serious discussion with you
not to be psychoanalyzed.
A serious discussion
about what, ghosts?
Yeah, this was a mistake.
I gotta get back anyway.
- Ethan.
- Bye, Hannah.
- In here! In here!
- Ethan, watch!
Go again. Go again.
It's so cool!
This is awesome!
Do you see this?
Isn't this amazing?
I know that was
a lot of fun today
but... you guys
have to promise me
you're not gonna
turn on the machine
when I'm not here, alright?
Okay, I promise.
Alright. Goodnight.
- Ethan?
- Yeah?
I really want to see them.
Mom says the signal
needs to be stronger.
- Hey.
- Hey.
For now, we keep this
top secret.
We can't tell anybody
what we're up to, not even Dag.
Okay?
Yeah.
And I'll talk to Becca too.
I don't know how
this is gonna affect her
but... I've opened
some kind of door
whether I like it or not.
But if there's a chance
we can talk to Mom and Dad
we gotta try.
There's still a long way to go.
I can't really seem
to strengthen the signal.
Every time I try cranking up
the power, I trip the breaker.
Shit.
So, what are you gonna do?
Welcome to my workshop.
I was half expecting
to find a DeLorean in here.
- I wish.
- How much is it pullin'?
Uh, a lot. A lot.
I just, I can't seem
to get enough juice
without blowing the breaker.
And I thought maybe
you'd have some..
...secret tricks
that you could show me.
Well, there's lots of ways
of nabbin' power
from your neighbor's houses
but, uh, it's pretty complicated
super illegal.
Right.
We could probably rig
somethin' up temporary.
- Yeah?
- Let's hit the basement.
Hey, Bec.
Were you talking
to Mom and Dad again?
Yeah, I was just telling them
about my new friend..
...Alice.
They don't think
I should talk to her.
Really?
So, do Mom and Dad
actually talk to you?
Like, full conversations?
Kind of.
W... why don't,
why don't they talk to me?
You're not ready yet.
What does that mean?
- That's what Mom says.
- And Dad?
What does Dad say?
I don't know.
He just wants us to make
the machine work better.
- That should do it.
- Alright.
You'll have access to most
of your house's power with this.
You're gonna wanna
re... replace it
with something more
permanent eventually
but should be fine
for now.
No. This is, this is perfect.
I knew you'd have something
up your sleeve.
Just remember, you wanna ramp
this thing up
you turn most of the things
off in your house.
Even a little bit
of an overdraw
it's enough to trip
the whole system.
You're gonna wanna make
a few adjustments
inside there too.
Make sure it can handle
the power, huh?
Yeah, I've definitely
got my work cut out for me
that's for sure.
Maybe some day you'll tell me
if this time machine of yours
actually works, huh?
Well, I'll need a
few more gigawatts for that
but I'll let you know.
Well, I'll, uh, see you around.
I'll walk you out of here.
Okay.
What do you think?
Modified the design,
made it a little bit simpler.
Bec, look!
What do you think?
Huh?
Does that mean
it'll work better?
Yeah, I hope so.
- That's the idea.
- Can we switch it back on now?
No, not yet.
Very soon, though.
I need extra help on cash.
Ah, here we go.
That's what we need.
One, two, three, four.
That's probably good, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.
- Yo, yo!
- Hey.
What happened in here?
You forget to pay the bills?
Uh, new house rule.
Use as little power as possible.
Okay.
I'm not supposed to tell you
but..
...I think my Mom and Dad
might be back.
Yeah, right.
I'm serious.
- A... are they here right now?
- Yeah.
Where? Show me.
Well, the machine's not on.
- I think he's working on it.
- Convenient.
I'm telling the truth, Dag.
I swear to God.
- Mrs. Lightman?
- Shut... shut up!
Come on. I'll show you
how to beat that level.
Becca!
Becca!
Show time!
I'm in the bath!
Quicker. Quicker.
Here we go.
Why'd you do that?
Hey. You okay?
Where's Lulu?
I gave her to Alice.
Oh.
I don't think
I've met Alice yet, have I?
She's shy.
I'm her only friend.
Oh, okay.
Um... alright.
Well, goodnight.
Ethan?
Hmm?
Does the machine work?
Not yet.
But it will. I promise.
Oh, hello.
Dude, check this out.
- You know your hot neighbor?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she's changing
in her bedroom
and curtains are wide open.
What?
Where?
She... she was, she was
right there. Um..
- You idiot!
- What?
Dude... dude, I swear.
- Come on. She was..
- Yeah.
What? You were getting turned on
by a hat rack?
Dude, it was
a woman's rack, okay?
Yeah, right.
Whatever. I'm gonna go
take a leak.
Yeah, make sure
that's all you do.
Ha, ha. Very funny, asshole.
Dag?
Dag!
Dag!
Jesus! Tom! Tom.
God, you scared me.
Hey.
I need to know.
What's that machine of yours
really do?
Well, um..
...the technical term
is electromagnetic induction...
Ethan!
Do not lie to me.
Your machine..
...has a radius beyond
this house.
I thought it was
some mental thing.
Leftover guilt from,
from having moved on.
What have you seen?
My wife.
She killed herself..
...right here in this house.
Truth is..
...I've always felt
like she was still here..
...watching me.
Turns out I was right.
She never left me.
- Alright. Have a good one.
- Bye.
See ya.
Hey, Ethan, do you have a sec?
Oh, yeah.
She's doing a lot better
since we last spoke.
Good. Yeah, she told me
she made a new friend.
Someone named Alice.
Oh. Yeah, she's mentioned Alice
to me too.
I, I assumed
she was a relative.
Why's that?
Well, Becca said
that she lives with you.
Hey, Jacob, uh..
...do you believe in ghosts?
I... do... not.
Hey, Bec, can you tell me
a little bit more about Alice?
Well, she's really nice.
She used to live where we live.
- You mean at our house?
- Yep.
Did she start visiting after
Ethan turned on the machine?
I think so.
She's always hiding on me,
though.
Why?
'Cause she's afraid of Henry.
That's why I gave her Lulu..
...to protect her.
Who's Henry?
I don't know.
I haven't met him yet.
Hannah!
Hey, Bec!
Come here.
I missed you.
- Hey, what's up?
- I missed you.
Hey, Matt.
Can you please take that inside,
and Becca?
- Come on, Bec.
- I'll be in there in a second.
You're staying for dinner,
right?
It's up to you.
- Yeah.
- Yes!
Um, I need
to show you something.
I had Adnan send me the video.
After watching it a few times,
I noticed something.
Okay, that'd be my shadow.
Yours, and what's that?
So, it's always done this,
since day one.
More power seems to intensify
the signal.
Oh, God. Hannah, I think the
signal's reaching beyond the house.
And since I've realized that,
I... I've been too afraid
to turn it back on.
I mean, Tom saw his dead wife.
It's one thing
bringing my parents back
but I'm pretty sure
everyone else
would rather
their loved ones stay dead.
But what makes you so sure
you're interacting
with your parents?
I mean, what if the machine
isn't bringing
people back exactly
just amplifying the energy
that's already there?
We're not just encountering an echo,
if that's what you're saying.
I mean, Becca's had entire
conversations with my parents.
- And Alice.
- Alice?
You just gave me an idea.
Who's Alice?
Let's find out.
Uh... hm.
Your parents bought
the house
from a family..
Oh. It's..
The Szerbiaks.
And they moved to Michigan,
I think.
And before the Szerbiaks
it was..
Hm.
It was Diane and Frank Evans?
Frank worked
at my father's practice.
Do you remember anyone
ever living there named Alice?
Where did you hear that name?
I haven't looked at these
in so long.
That's me, Jo-Jo Gold
and Alice.
Alice lived at your house
with Mr. and Mrs. Gifford.
She was their foster child.
One day..
...she disappeared.
The police looked for her.
We all did.
But she was never found.
There was never any evidence
to prove anything
but the police
were convinced
that Mr. Gifford
had done something to Alice.
Dag?
Technical difficulties.
I'm re-spawning.
Do you remember
Mr. Gifford's first name?
Oh.
Uhm.
Henry!
Henry.
Found you!
Help!
Becca!
Becca!
Stop!
Ethan!
Hey, are you okay?
- Hey. Hey, where's Becca?
- Yeah..
Ethan, Matt, help!
- Becca! Where are you?
- Becca?
- Becca!
- Becca!
Becca, where are you?
- Becca!
- Bec!
- Becca!
- Becca, are you okay?
- Where are you?
- Becca!
Ethan!
- Help!
- Oh, God.
- Help!
- Why are they doing this?
It's not them.
It's not Mom and Dad.
- What do you mean?
- It's not Mom and Dad!
No.
Ethan, help!
She's in here.
Help!
- Becca!
- Where am I?
Becca!
Becca!
It's a tunnel.
Becca!
Matt!
- What do you see?
- Bec!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Matt!
Are you okay?
Tom?
Matt, can you see Becca?
Becca!
Where are you?
Tom?
Becca?
Becca?
Matt!
I found her!
Do not come any closer.
I mean it.
Look, you don't know
what you're doing.
- Walk away, Ethan.
- Move.
Hey.
Becca.
Turn around.
Let her go!
Becca!
- No! Stop!
- Ah!
Becca!
- Hannah!
- Ah!
Hannah!
Becca, who's doing this?
Henry.
Hannah! Hurry!
Please. Tom!
I can't lose her again.
No. You can't go back!
Remember?
You can't go back! Argh!
Becca!
Becca, wake up.
Please wake up..
Becca..
Listen to me, Tom!
Listen to me.
They're gonna kill Becca.
They're gonna kill her!
That thing's not Karen!
She's gone!
Ethan!
Matt! Becca!
Gentle.
Hey. Becca. Come on.
- Becca.
- Becca.
- Becca. Becca.
- Hey. Becca.
- Becca.
- Come on.
- Matt? Hannah?
- Hey.
Okay.
Well, well, well..
We're finally all done here.
Great. Okay.
We'll follow you.
- You got the address, right?
- Yepper. Um-huh.
And guess what I found upstairs?
This.
And I'm guessing that this
belongs to you, little lady.
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.
Alright, boys.
- I'll help you unpack later.
- Alright. Sounds good.
Um..
So, I just wanted to say
thank you.
Any time.
- I'll see you at 8:00.
- Bye.
Oh! Ethan, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Wait.
Oh, I couldn't believe
you'd go.
Bye. Bye, bye.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Bye, Matt.
Becca, sweetheart.
- You be safe now.
- Okay. I will.
- Okay.
- Alright. Take care.
Bye.
Alright.
This place is going to be
amazing for you guys.
Yeah, and only ten minutes
from school.
- Ethan, guess what.
- What?
Matt says there's a pool
two blocks away.
- Did he really tell you that?
- Um-hm.
After I told him
that was gonna be a surprise?
Are you serious?
Dude, come on.
But, yes,
I'm also a psychopath.
Have you guys checked
for secret rooms yet?
Matt..
Matt, no.
Too soon.
Dr. Phil says humor is
a healthy method for recovery.
- Is that show still on?
- Who's Dr. Phil?
Dr. Phil is...
She doesn't even know
who that is.
Can you get the door?
