Trigun Movie: Badlands Rumble
Alert! Alert!
We've received a tip on a bank robbery!
Eh?
Good luck with that.
If you catch him, contact me.
This isn't the typical robber.
It's him!
Gasback!
What?!
I'm counting on you for backup.
One squad... No, two squads!
I'm sending an entire platoon your way!
It's a rat race!
In the end, the world is really a rat race.
Hey!
Their things belong to us.
Our things belong to them.
Everyone thinks only of their own share.
Isn't that right?
That's not true!
Everyone here works—
You're the same.
It just so happens that in your village there's enough to go around.
You just haven't realized that your wealth is stolen from others.
No, I'm not blaming you.
I said it, didn't I? The world is a rat race.
Women and men, the old and the young.
Anyone can participate in it!
My nose...
Cain.
I think you should really do something about that thieving nature of yours.
Stealing behind other people's backs is no good.
It doesn't suit me.
And swindling is out of the question.
That's not something a human should do.
That being said, a proper profession is even more taboo.
Why?
You can't see the faces of the people you steal from.
I wouldn't be able to see your flabbergasted faces, right?
It's because we're face-to-face that this is a rat race.
Boss, it's good to go!
Yeah!
It's over.
Once Gasback got involved, it was certain that not even a single scrap would be left behind.
Let's think of it in a different way.
If we don't resist, at least we'll keep our lives.
Cheer up.
See, if it wasn't Gasback, if it was the Humanoid Typhoon Vash the Stampede instead...
Forget about scraps, not even a single hair from our heads would be left.
You're right.
I see. It's better than being confronted by that guy.
I'm glad it's Gasback, I'm glad it's Gasback,
I'm glad it's Gasback, I'm glad it's Gasback...
The last... one...
That's truly a nice expression.
I'm satisfied.
Hey Cain, you done yet?
This is the last one!
It's time for us to part.
I hate to go, but I'll be pulling out.
You'll be staying behind, Gasback.
That wasn't a misfire, was it?
That was the final volley for you and your work.
I can't keep up with you!
Like an idiot you keep aiming for big things
and then sink all of the cash you earn into the next big operation!
You'd do that this time too!
That's what robbers live for.
What would be the point if robbers didn't take robbery seriously!?
Quit joking around.
If you'd rather take things seriously then why become a robber?
That's right!
I see. You've roused these two dimwits.
We want to live an easy and luxurious life.
Today's your last day as the leader of this operation!
Is that so?
I've had enough of your weak ambitions too.
Would you be surprised if I said that we tipped off the authorities for tonight's job?
Relax, we'll take the cash.
And we'll blow your corpse away cleanly too!
Do you intend to take me out on your own—
Whoops. I didn't think you'd notice.
There's no way I could take you unarmed.
Bye bye, Gasback.
If you pull that trigger, it'll be your end, not mine.
Don't act tough.
Then go ahead and do it.
Don't shoot!
You'll hit him!
I don't know what just happened, but it seems luck is on my side!
Calm down? I am calm.
I'll just break your head open in one shot!
Stop it...
I was wrong...
Forgive me!
You've done the one thing you shouldn't have.
You've tarnished the robbery! My robbery!
It's a shame.
After I blow your head off, I won't be able to see the face I stole your life from!
Ahhh! My donuts!
Quickly! Quick, move away from there!
Hurry!
My donuts...
You're so mean!
I was saving the best one for last!
I can't eat them like this!
Do you wanna die? Quit moving around.
When I was eating my donuts, you guys came through, and I got caught up in this whole mess!
You should have tied me up!
Were you dropped on the head as a child or something?
Or are you naturally like this?
Or were you—
Anyway, compensate me for these!
Shut up!
Compensation—
If you're gonna interfere...
What's with you?
Get away from me, you idiot!
Compensation, compensation!
It can't be...
Food grudges are scary.
The Japanese sure had it right.
Shut up.
I don't know what I stole from you...
It's Vash the Stampede!
Ah! Save me!
Shut up!
If you start spewing nonsense, you'll go first!
Compensation...
Could you have be the one that's been disrupting me from the beginning?
Just what are you trying to do?
Why is it your business to save either me or them?
Well you see..
Isn't living better?
That's not something I would think the Humanoid Typhoon would say.
Ah, well it isn't really...
I'm not impressed.
To give freely, even if it's life, is to rebel against the way of the world.
But if you give it freely then it can't be stolen, right?
One can't take back the dice once cast.
Huh?
You've cast another's dice.
I hope you don't regret it.
See ya.
Isn't that overdoing it?
Could you have...?
Huh? Do you mean the Plant?
It seems it's all right.
More importantly, look.
This is bad!
Adios.
Vash is the mastermind?
I'm the mastermind?!
The red coat fluttering in the blistering sand...
...turning towns into ash.
The Devil's envoy.
Vash the Stampede.
The man with a $$60 billion bounty on his head, known as the Humanoid Typhoon.
Voztot's the same as ever.
He laid low for a while, but now he's got a $$100 million bounty on his head.
This morning it went up to 300 million.
300 million?!
I'd like to aim for that too.
Nice, you'd come back as just a head.
What? You can't do it either.
I wouldn't try in the first place.
Ugh, what bad taste.
It's taken five years to construct that for Mr. Kepler, the man who rebuilt Macca City's Plant twenty years ago...
To erect a statue of yourself... Seems like he'd be a difficult guy to talk to.
It's all right! We've brought presents!
And they're a bit bigger than usual!
Hey ladies!
If you're free, wanna get some drinks?
The kind with alcohol.
We're fine.
And we're busy.
Hey, hey, wait up.
Just for a little bit?
Come with us. Even the big one.
Okay?
Oh dear, it broke off again.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm so sorry.
That was quite rude of me.
Why are there bounty hunters gathered here?
Haven't you seen this?
This is?
Gasback.
There are rumors of him targeting this city.
Mr. Kepler is gathering bodyguards.
Meryl?
Now I get why the main office suddenly sent us out to confirm the insurance contract.
That statue's insured for $$5 billion!
5 billion?!
Our Bernadelli insurance agency is in grave danger!
You tricked me!
It's over. Leave.
Here you go, 75 cents.
Tomaku—
Hey. Tomakun for me.
Please observe the order of the line.
Make it quick. 200 onku.
If you're going to eat it, pay first!
Tomakun and sausage.
There's been so many mannerless pigs lately.
Gasback just doesn't die.
Isn't he like an old man?
The $$300 million bounty should be easy to get.
Is that so?
Don't let your guard down or the the tables will turn on you.
Cowards wavering in the wind might as well leave right now.
Right, bro?
Are you... a woman?
Let me see your face...
Don't touch me.
I found a little birdie in this dump!
Hey lady, are you alone? Wanna eat together?
Move!
Hey lady, come here!
Hey, I found her first!
Won't you travel with me? It'll be fun!
Hey, lady?
Oh, she's a beauty.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Eh? What did you say?
Seems like he's unwelcome. How pitiful!
Didn't you hear me when I said, "Don't touch me"?
Making such a fuss over a woman, are you guys virgins?
Well this is quite the authoritative woman.
I love women like you.
The way you force people to listen to you—
It isn't good manners to hold a knife inside a ship.
Move.
Too late to apologize, you bitch!
He got his ass kicked twice now!
Don't underestimate me, woman!
You haven't been kicked around enough yet?
I won't listen to your bragging!
This girl's got a bad habit with her legs.
Nice. Go around and we'll hold her down.
Um, before...
...you used a knife, right?
Didn't you drop it around here?
I was thinking of eating some toma,
but I misplaced my knife.
Can I borrow yours?
I fucking hate idiots like you. I'll kill you!
There it is!
I found it! This is it!
That other guy dropped it here, right?
Just let me borrow it for a bit.
Now then... let's try out a bit of this toma.
Is that okay?
No.
Oh, come on.
So I can't have my snack?
Here.
Hey, idiot.
Yes?
You fucking moron!
No, don't!
I'm sorry, I was wrong! I apologize.
Shut up, move!
Don't say that—
Right, like this!
Let go of me you bastard!
Just calm down, okay?
I got it, just let go!
Okay, thanks!
What an idiot.
Twice too. But did you see that?
Yeah, I did.
I won't forgive either of you.
Especially the woman!
He's finally snapped.
This isn't a joke!
Idiot!
Didn't you say something like, "Don't touch me?"
I'll make you regret it!
I'm going to torture you.
Even if you cry, I won't forgive you.
I'll make you cry your eyes out.
Do you know what it means to piss me off?
It means I'll rob you of all your freedom!
Kneel.
Kneel!
I've changed my mind!
You mustn't make a fuss.
And if you shoot this, it'll be bad, right?
Please stop applauding.
It makes me feel weird.
Those guys shot their guns!
Not firing guns inside the ship is rule number one, isn't it?
We've got to observe the rules!
Ah, well let's treat them with a forgiving heart...
You can't go against it either.
I can't stand to be grouped with thugs like you!
Here!
Those are your guns!
Here!
That's your food and your water!
Be grateful!
And this is to remember us by!
If we ever change our minds, we'll come pick up your remains!
Well, this is where we part.
It's pretty ostentatious.
The guards look dangerous but gorgeous!
I've kept you waiting. I am Kepler.
Ah, yes!
I apologize for coming at this busy time.
You're from the insurance company?
Yes, we are.
But first...
It's nothing special...
Hey, what are you do—
It's fine. There is no danger.
I see. You may go.
I apologize. We're in a high state of alert right now.
Still frozen.
Revise the contract? Why?
Well, you see...
I should have given you time to explain the contents and decide on the amount.
Do you doubt my sincerity?
No, it's just that the assessed property is still under construction,
and we must confirm that there are no mistakes before its completion...
That's the symbol of this town.
You can't put a price on that.
Yes, it's wonderful!
Then there shouldn't be any problems!
Not just the statue, but I'd actually like to insure the Plant too.
It's because of that Plant that the townspeople and I can make a living.
Won't the money keep coming in even if you don't do anything?
I'm so sorry! Insuring the Plant is impossible.
We can't possibly cover damage insurance.
And our handling...
I get it.
But the coverage amount for the statue must remain the same!
Meryl, is it okay not to assess it?
Our company is the strongest one in the business.
It was determined that 5 billion be the correct amount.
There's nothing we can do at this point.
I see...
The reason we were dispatched was not to assess the claim, but rather to guard it against the possibility of us having to pay for it.
But...
In a place with this many people, how could a thing that big get stolen?
It's not just a question of whether or not it gets stolen.
If Gasback appears here...
5 billion!
Milly!
We've got no choice but to defend it.
If you don't want to be in the care of unemployment insurance, that is.
Roger!
Hey there!
Hey, let's talk!
We didn't talk at all inside the ship!
I wanna know more about you!
Nope. There's nothing to talk about.
You're so cold.
So where are you from? What's your name?
First time in this town?
I thought I already thanked you for saving me, so why are you following me?
Because I feel that fate brought us together.
Huh? Didn't you feel it?
You're getting on my nerves.
I felt it on the back of my neck like whoa!
Surely you felt it too.
Like this...
Cut it out!
Please, tell me your name!
Are you all right?
Its an allergic reaction!
This is what happens when idiots like you touch me!
Even a good guy like me?
Good? All men are the same!
Then you shouldn't have come to this town.
It's full of idiotic male bounty hunters.
Don't lump me in with those guys.
This isn't inside a Sand Steamer.
But I really want to know your name.
I'll kill you!
What's wrong, Meryl?
I just saw a bad omen.
No, it was a mistake. It must be mistake.
Cain...
Idiot. I told you not to come out!
So he'll be coming here.
There's no way he'd be satisfied with only stripping you the bone.
I... lost everything.
Just when things were going well.
Next is either me or Michio.
Shouldn't you run-
Throw it all away while I can?
I've finally made it big!
I won't stand for it being all stolen away!
Fire!
Cease fire!
It's my job.
Sorry.
Money!
Give me back my money!
Can't I pay you back with tonkatsu?
You promised you'd get it back!
Don't let them get away, officer!
Bro, you're an excellent bodyguard.
Way above the rest.
W-why?
It won't take...my bills!
You're in the way, bro.
If you're dying, head for the graveyard up ahead.
P-please.
Church...
Huh?
Boss..
To think I wouldn't steal from a stranger.
This is the second time I've done it.
Well that makes you a generous man.
Keep livin'!
I'm planning another big job.
I'm returning the favor for saving me.
But as I told you, I won't participate in robbery.
I'm just a bodyguard.
Hey now, you can't just say you're not participating in this rat race after firing a cross like that.
Even so, I'm a man of the cloth.
It's against my principles to get involved.
So I shoot my cross.
Never heard of a priest like that!
Going to eat?
Shall I accompany you?
Hey lady!
Yo!
A woman?
For sure.
She won't come if you do that!
You again?
Don't follow me.
We boarded the same Sand Steamer and came to the same town; It's clearly fate!
You should treasure things like that.
If that's so, then you've got much more of a connection with those guys.
You came for the bounty on Gasback too, right?
Me?
Aren't I right?
I understand now. The reason I came was to meet you.
Miss Amelia.
How do you know my name?
I saw the hotel register.
Are we at the same hotel?!
Don't you mean, the same room?
Itchy!
Amelia~
Let me throw one more! You got in my way!
Sorry.
It's my turn.
Not fair!
Lame!
Move it!
Let me try!
See, I'm guaranteed to win.
Bingo!
Give it up!
All right, pay up, pay up!
Forget it.
Welcome. Two?
No, one.
Would it be too much trouble for us to get a quiet table?
One!
Table for two please!
One is fine!
Huh, coincidence isn't it?
It's been a long time—
Well this is a coincidence.
I have some friends over there!
And they happen to have two seats open!
Lets sit with them—
Hey, I'm looking for a single seat, please?
There's no room but over there.
Cheers!
Good work today!
So Amelia is after Gasback? That's great!
If you ever happen to think about life insurance, we have a really nice plan.
Shall I explain it to you?
N-No, I'm fine.
That ill foreboding is no good!
She's strong! Right?
And what about you?
Huh?
Did you come here for the bounty too?
Nah I happen to be here for some sightseeing.
Is that really true?
You won't have anything to do with Gasback?
Well, maybe...
"Maybe" is a troubling answer!
Even without you, the statue is steeped with danger, and now even the Humanoid Typhoon—
In any case, won't you please leave?
Eh? We just met up after so long, and this is what you say?
Just by you being here trouble will surely follow.
Don't say such a cold thing.
I'm just sightseeing.
I can't trust you.
Actually trouble is around the corner already..
Could you and Gasback...
Hey, I just got here today.
And I thought I wouldn't have to see you girls again so soon, why are you here?
It's company orders; Our priorities have changed.
It's our job.
She's as strict as ever.
Yes! She's reliable!
Ah, enough!
Do whatever you want here, just leave soon!
Since you're a liability, after this job is over we'll just end up following you around again!
Eh? So insurance people are stalkers?
Stalkers? Are we that bad?
Oww-w-w! What are you doing? That hurts!
Today's the day. Even if you act like this, I wont let you have your way.
That's even worse, it'll come off!
It'll come off!
Shut up, shut up!
Vash!
Vash the Stam—
Is it okay for this town to be in a panic?
There's nothing good that could come from you being here.
Hey you!
You can't do this to Vash the Stampede and get away with it!
Hah, with a face like that, you couldn't be Vash!
No, it could work!
It's fitting for an idiot to say something like that!
Hey lady, are you his babysitter? Must be rough.
It's cosplay isn't it? A bad outfit like that suits you!
Here he is! Vash the Stampede!
I get it, I get it. You're the real thing.
He doesn't look like him at all.
Come up with a new stage name and try again!
Ah, thank you, thank you.
Amelia, you fell for it!
Are you a true idiot?
I'm the legendary bounty!
So scary!
Nobody believed...
That turned out well but... at this rate...
Look.
Doesn't it just scream "Steal me"?
You've got bad taste for sure.
To think you'd really aim for that.
I've got a little score to settle with the owner.
I knew where he was but I was delayed a bit.
Even so, this robbery will be the best one I've ever pulled off.
Instead of messing up when I wasn't ready, I waited... waited... waited.
So I could snatch it away at the ideal time.
The act is the same but the aftertaste of it is completely different.
Robbery is the same.
To reach the peak and steal every last thing.
The victim will taste absolute despair that no one has ever tasted before.
Half-assed robbery is no good.
Isn't that right?
I'll pull off the best robbery this world's ever seen.
That's what I'm aiming for.
Stick with me to the end, bro.
The contract lasts 'til we get to his mansion.
I'm indebted to a suffering wretch, aren't I.
It's the guy that can't hold his liquor again.
Don't tease me. I love this atmosphere.
Then I won't turn you away.
Well, just one glass.
I'm telling you...
That statue is trouble. If there's a claim, Gasback will make our company go poof!
I see.
A guy like Gasback... like Gasback...
Bathroom.
Have fun!
Yo.
What?
Like I said, that statue is big trouble.
And Gasback will...
What did you just say?
Like I said...
Women and money can't be obtained with only brute force.
I thought I heard something that sounded like "shit" after that.
Did I mishear?
Oh no it's just a misunderstanding.
If you didn't hear me I'll tell you again.
You bag of shit.
What did you say?!
You bitch!
A fight!
If it's a fight, let me join in!
I'll kill you!
Fight!
Uninvolved guys should butt out!
Fight!
Meryl...
There seems to be some kind of trouble.
Don't praise them, stop them!
This is it, a real bar room!
How's that?
Shit!
You!
Hey everyone calm down!
This is everyone's fun watering hole, so let's get along and drink!
Alright!
I won't forgive you!
Huh? Why?
Where did the bullets go?
You!
Give me back my ammo!
Well we're in this hotel.
See you later then.
Good night!
The coverage amount is $$5 billion!
Insurance workers sure have it hard.
Let me down. I can walk.
Don't put on some false show of bravado.
It's fine. I won't touch you.
I'll only touch you in bed—
Hey did you know?
Once Gasback was cornered and on the verge of being captured.
20 years ago.
He was about to be killed by his comrades, and some idiot let him get away.
Really, there's a limit to being a nuisance.
If he had died then, how many people would have lived?
That man is partially responsible for the deaths of those people.
By him... I...
Did something precious to you get stolen by him?
Perhaps it was... a maiden's first kiss—
You drank my beer!
Jeez.
I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about!
What did a guy like you come here for?
Dunno.
It feels like I'm chasing cast dice.
Huh?
In other words...
The dice have created a lover's paradise for me and you!
You...
Are you gonna puke?
Tell me if you are, okay? Okay?!
I'm okay...
Really?
We're heading up the stairs!
Hey, let me down!
Stop, you—
Hey wait!
Mommy, what's that?
It's a precious secret.
A precious secret?
When you grow up, I'll tell you one day.
Mom! Mom!
Mom!!
I'm sorry, Amelia.
For not being able to be beside you... while you grow up.
Even though I promised... to tell you about the precious secret...
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom.
Hey you guys!
If you don't hold back, when it comes time to work you won't be able to!
I'd say the same for you.
Let's return to the office.
Let's continue the rounds!
I'm on patrol!
Is everything in order?
Ah, good evening.
No problems.
It'll provide this town's electric power for several hundred years more.
That's amazing.
$$5 billion...
Let's get going, guys!
It's Gasback!
Unable to confirm ID.
Vacate the premises immediately.
If you do not comply within two minutes, you will be eliminated.
Furthermore, if you make use of weaponry, you will be eliminated.
Ah, you're pissing me off. Machines shouldn't speak.
Eliminate.
Nice one, bro.
You've got some bizarre stuff going on there.
It turns them black instantly
Usually it takes ten lives to destroy just one of those things.
Boss!
What? Michio's factory?
He says, "Please hide me."
Fine.
Just let him come.
Hey, I heard that Gasback attacked Denna City last night!
Seriously?
You... got... me...
Yay! We defeated Gasback!
I'm going to get you back! Roar!
Oh, well if it isn't Vash.
Good morning.
Huh? You two seem perfectly refreshed despite drinking so much yesterday.
We just received great news.
We heard that Gasback attacked a factory last night in Denna instead of here.
His target was most likely not here.
I thought it was weird for him to target such an unfashionable bronze statue like that.
Don't you think you're saying too much, Meryl?
Now then, we have to go contact the main office.
We'll excuse ourselves now.
Please excuse us!
So, the news about Gasback attacking here was fake.
We were toyed with.
Hey, hey! Where are you going?
I'm going to a different town, since I've gathered enough information here.
So, the fact that Gasback was attacking this town was just a rumor.
He was probably the one who spread the news.
I don't really thi—
Yeah, you're right.
There's no way he would attack a remote town like this.
See ya.
It'd be great if we met up again somewhere.
You're really bad at acting!
You still think that Gasback will attack this place, don't you?
Do you know something I don't?!
And why do you keep trying to drive me away?
No, I'm not really...
It's just like him to gather all these weaklings together.
But with this, I can pull off an even flashier robbery!
It's Gasback!
Amelia.
Shit!
He came this early in the morning?
I'll be the one to take his head!
Old men shouldn't be out this early!
Move!
Gasback is mine!
To the strongest, $$300 million!
Let's do our job!
Gasback has attacked.
Shit, my head hurts.
He really came, Meryl!
What should we do?!
Well that's obvious-
We have to protect the statue!
I knew it!
Meryl...
Do you understand, everyone?
We can't let him lay a single finger on the statue!
Who's she?
I don't know.
He came!
I can't wait anymore!
Aren't you gonna protect him?
What are you going to do about the contract?!
Cain!
It's going to be okay, right?!
Wouldn't it be better if we ran away now?
Shut up!
My fortune isn't something worthless that's easily abandoned like you guys and yours!
What do you mean by worthless?!
What kind of end do you think it'll come to if we're captured?
Shut up!
That guy is coming here to get revenge!
Revenge for what we did to him 20 years ago!
He's going to steal everything.
Anything and everything...
Anything and everything!
Ah, my fingers are numb!
Are you the guy who's been doing those petty things?!
Petty?
Is that how it looked to you?
You mustn't pass through here.
It's you.
Are you planning to stick your head where it doesn't belong again?
I don't understand.
But, I'll be passing through.
If possible, could you retreat?
I have some business with the people inside.
Business? You want to kill them.
You can say that!
No, then I can't let you through!
No, you'll be letting him through.
Wolfwood.
Spikey, can you stand back?
When did you turn into a robber?
Don't joke around with me!
There's complicated reasons as to why I'm doing this!
Move!
Wait! I can't!
I won't move!
This isn't funny!
I'm serious.
Me too.
Contract complete.
He's here!
You...!
Gasback!
It's all their fault!
The betrayal from 20 years ago too!
Please...
Forgive me with this!
Please!
At least, accept my sincerity.
Please...
Please, please!
Cain.
You were always a piece of unsalvageable trash.
But it seems you've gotten worse as you got older.
Stop...
Stop!
Stop!
Hold it right there!
Gasback!
Amelia?
This is as far as you go!
You're finished.
Oh, this is some authoritative girl we've got here.
It's become quiet, hasn't it?
Could it be... that it's over?
Then, that means we were saved!
Why are you being so easygoing?
Don't let your guard down.
Yes...
Give it up, girl.
You're going to get hu—
Don't move!
Your weird abilities won't work on me.
Oh, that's some confidence you've got there.
If you were that serious, you should've shot me in the back with no hesitation.
You won't defeat me if you can't do that much.
Timeout.
Why don't you wait a second, since this is our long awaited reunion?
Huh? Wa—
Let go!
Stop it!
We should say something like a "nice to see you again" after 20 years, right Mr. Gasback?
We met earlier out front.
You're unexpectedly observant.
You're fooling around as always.
How is it that your appearance hasn't changed after 20 years?
It must be my spirit.
Do you want me to blow off your finger?!
No.
Then, let go!
No, because you'll shoot if I do!
Of course I will!
Then no!
Shit!
Gasback will run away as well!
So, let go!
I don't want to.
I'm really going to shoot if you don't stop fooling around!
I still don't want to.
Hey, Vash!
Are you trying to save me like you did 20 years ago?
Jeez, I'm tired of hearing about the "Humanoid Typhoon."
Humanoid?
Are you...?!
The legendary guy...
...from 20 years ago?
Vash, I said to you back then.
I wasn't impressed by you saving a single life in this world of robbery.
Do you think the dice you cast turned out well?
Who knows...
See ya!
Wait!
He got away.
So, you were the idiot from 20 years ago.
Why...
Why did you do such a thing?
From the first time I met you,
And at the bar too, right?
Why?
Some kind of religion?
Because...
Isn't it unpleasant?
Being alive after all.
Since you're like that, you may be able to satisfy yourself with the lives you save,
But do you know that there are people crying because of that?!
If you didn't save him back then, there would be people still alive!
There are people who could have lived without any suffering!
Even...
Even my mom!
Gasback...
I will definitely kill him!
You're a difficult man, as always.
What can I do?
It's my nature.
I'm the one who cast the dice.
The worst number came up, though.
Like I'll ever hand it to that bastard!
My 20 years of hard work!
I wonder about that, Cain.
Your life isn't enough to settle the score for what you did to me 20 years ago!
I need to steal everything that's yours!
I'll show you!
This is the best robbery in the world!
Detonating that near the Plant, are you insane!?
My boss made me do such troublesome things.
What?!
It was fun while it lasted.
What did you do?!
What did you do to my Plant?!
Just be a good boy and watch!
The Plant is...!
The town will...!
Meryl...
No way!
What's this?
It's rolling down!
What should we do now, Meryl?
Well, um...
We have to run of course!
While there's life, there's hope!
What a relief.
It didn't break, right?
$$5 billion...!
It's that face, Cain!
I wanted to see that face of yours!
You tarnished my robbery.
This is the price.
Boss!
It's connected!
Start the engine!
The Plant...
Could this be...
The Plant was taken.
No way!
So, it was made for that cargo.
This town is done for!
Amelia!
Hey, Spikey!
Move!
Or we're going to run over you!
We're not going to let you get away, Gasback!
Hurry up and go after him!
Let's go as well!
We won't let you get away!
You're hopeless!
Drive properly!
You know that I suck at driving!
I can only do this much!
Switch with me!
Switch with me now!
Stop!
Hey, look forward!
Wait!
Destroying the Plant is something you don't want to do!
Letting Gasback escape is more of a problem!
Move out of my way!
I said move!
You can't!
Are you an idiot?!
Wait!
Just wait a second!
Don't do it, Amelia!
Vash, move!
Don't get in my way as well!
Saying that won't...!
Amelia!
Calm down first!
Look out!
Spikey!
Girl!
Spikey!
Why?
Just why?
Even though I told him to die...
...how can he make that kind of face?
Why?
His face said...
"It's all right".
What do you mean?!
Is that all?!
So, it's okay for him to die...
...when he tells others not to kill?
That doesn't make any sense.
My mom is dead.
It's because he saved Gasback.
Not just my mom.
Many more people would be alive if he didn't save him.
Saving those who don't need to be saved.
Dying just like that.
I really don't understand!
Does it make sense to you?
Is there a meaning behind him dying?!
His rhetoric...
His ideals...
They disappear once he dies!
True.
He really struggled through it.
Well, casting the dice like that...
If there was meaning behind it...
No, maybe it's the fact that we want there to be meaning to it.
But it's as you said.
Nothing is gained through death.
Nothing moves without the Plant!
The electricity is gone!
Will we have enough water?
The elderly at my house will die without a heater!
Calm down.
We're asking for emergency help from another town right now.
And we're already looking into renting a new Plant.
Tonight! We need it tonight!
I know, but water comes first!
Without the Plant, we can't get any water!
Please save us!
Our son was in an operation and stopped breathing just now!
The doctors are doing their best.
But, who knows how long he'll last...
My brother will...
Shit!
To think that Gasback would steal the Plant!
At this rate, the town is done for!
Wait! Destroying the Plant is something you don't want to do!
Letting Gasback escape is more of a problem!
Move!
I...
...am the same.
The same as Gasback...
The idiot.
Mommy, what's that?
This is a precious secret.
A precious secret?
I'll tell you one day when you get older.
I'm sorry, Amelia.
For not being able to be beside you...
...while you grow up.
The precious secret that I promised to tell you about...
I'll tell you—
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
What is it, mom?
What is it?!
Mom!
Meryl.
Meryl!
We have to tell the main office about the end of Vash the Stampede.
Let's hurry up!
Look out, Meryl!
You worked as Gasback's bodyguard, right?
It looks like my popularity is at its end.
I'm free right now.
Then, will you work for me?
So you're going to do it after all?
You and Vash live by the same principles?
Give me all you've got as an advance payment.
And why don't I add breakfast to that as well?
I'm the type that needs to eat breakfast.
Boss!
The bodyguard bro. .
And that girl again?
Coming by themselves is a joke.
We'll take cover on the left.
Run to where I shoot!
All right.
One.
Two.
Three!
Go!
Over there!
Now then.
You missed on purpose, didn't you.
You're not going to take my bullets?
But anything more than this is an eyesore.
I'll be taking back the Plant.
What?
That's as far as you go.
In this world of stealing and being stolen from, to steal from a robber means we're in the same business.
If that's so, if I steal your life you should have no complaints.
You've tarnished my robbery!
Glad you came, bro.
Don't move!
Sorry for you. That's as far as you go.
I'll be taking your life too.
Adios, bro.
Did you use blanks or something!?
It can't be! I properly...
Amelia, are you all right?
Hey... wasn't that a bit too sloppy?
What if you hurt Amelia?
More importantly, you died!
Well I thought I was dead too, but look!
There's nothing better for a man of the desert than hard tomakuns.
But the insurance girls passing by....
Ah, I thought I was gonna die.
You...
I'm going to wring your neck later.
Eh? You're not glad?
Shall I wring it now?
Please don't.
So is there anything else I should tell you?
Any more than this is tough.
Vash!
I want to settle this with you.
Ah, let's not...
Shut up!
I'm moving forward. After I take your life.
Won't you answer the call of the dice?
Wolfwood.
Don't interfere.
You're too nice.
Amelia.
It's not exactly a duel, but...
When this hits the ground...
That was overwhelming.
I see now that the legend of the Humanoid Typhoon wasn't just "bad luck."
Sorry.
I have to apologize to you.
Yes.
If you hadn't saved Gasback 20 years ago, my mom might have been saved.
I'm sorry. Really.
Not yet... Not... yet...!
Wait!
Your lives... I'll...
Steal them!
What?!
You... that glove is...
Where did you get that glove?!
I made that, and she...
My mother.
My mother left it to me.
What?
Yes.
The person you entrusted this to 20 years ago.
Then, you are?
After you disappeared, Mom gave birth to me alone.
She suffered and suffered.
It can't be.
I gave her something so that she could live an easy life.
A man like you stole it!
Stole everything!
No one would help Gasback's wife and kid!
You knew...
Doctors ignored her as well.
She... gave that to you...
She didn't say the reason.
And you...
That's not it.
That's not it, right.
That's not what mother wanted to say.
I guess this means I've cast the dice too.
I can't laugh at you.
Gasback!
Don't think you'll get away like this!
If I don't kill you I can't live as I like!
Tch. So he lived.
Ah, how troublesome.
After all that, he's here?
Wow, what a design.
Wolfwood, I leave the rest to you.
Idiotic nonsense!
Won't you stick through till the end?
It's thanks for hitting me with your car.
I don't need this!
Everyone should disappear!
Everyone besides me!
Hey Spikey!
Fine.
Hey, is it all right?
Hey, let's go.
But really...
Even if they couldn't pay the full amount, they could at least have given us a bonus or reward.
That's not something a mercenary should say.
You could have collected the bounty, right?
Why'd you turn it down?
If I went to the police there'd be a fight!
Also don't rely on my wallet.
Are you still saying that?
I'm walking with a lump of $$60 billion.
Maybe I should have stayed a robber's errand boy.
Don't kid me.
Get away from me.
I'm so unlucky.
We'll be going on ahead.
We have to get back to the office as soon as possible.
It's good we didn't have to pay the insurance for the statue!
Oh, good for you.
Since the insured was a criminal under a fake name, of course we didn't have to!
With this, we can report about you too!
Lively girls.
Come with me. That will protect you.
Thank you.
But I can't tag along with a robber.
I'll keep this.
If I give it back, all our ties would be cut, right?
And, the next time we meet...
I lost to him.
Did you know that girl was nineteen years old?
I figured she was somewhere around there.
In other words, you knew that twenty years ago, if you hadn't saved Gasback she wouldn't have been born?
Well, that's not all.
The roll of the dice wasn't all that bad.
Yeah.
Hey where are you going?
The nearest town is that way. Straight ahead.
Hey. Wait a minute.
Show me that paper!
Hey!
Escaped from their 270 year prison sentence, the Dodongo Brothers...
Hey...
Are you... involved?
With these complicated-sounding guys?
Which is it?
Hey answer me?
Are you involved?
Or not?
Hey wait!
