FOUR YEARS EARLIER
Good job, Angelito. Perfect, keep it up.
Uh-huh, guys.
Here ya go. Should run now.
- Look, she's over there.
- The one with the ass?
Nah...
- one with Estrella and the other chick.
- Damn...
On Saturday I banged her
in the bathroom at Space.
You already knew that.
What are you talking about?
I didn't see anything, bro.
So, you weren't banging
on the door, asshole?
Yeah, uh,
'cause I had to take a leak, bro.
Look, man,
those girls are laughing at us, dude.
- You gonna say hi or what?
- Nah, fuck that, bro.
The other one's hotter, right?
- Who?
- Estrella, dude.
Forget about her,
she's with Poli.
- Wasn't that prick in prison?
- No, he got out after four days.
And that same night
the nutjob was already robbing some store.
That guy's gotta have a permanent hard-on
with that chick, yeah?
Bet she's always suckin' him off.
Yeah, dude, she'd get her mouth around it
and suck it right off.
Could you guys shut the fuck up?
- Ah, shit, Angelito's getting pissed.
- Ooh!
- Oh, no.
- What's up, Angelito?
You hot for Estrella?
- Fuck both of you.
- Where you goin'? We're talkin'.
Aw, come on, chill, bro.
Hey, just one thing.
Next time, just say it to my face, okay?
You got it?
You two good with that?
What's with her?
I like that, traps shut.
Grandpa, how's it going?
What?
Are your plants already bug-infested?
Don't talk to me about bugs,
I'm sick to death of these bugs.
This right here, though,
this is gonna mess with 'em.
Okay. Don't overdo it, all right?
Or no one'll eat them.
How's Chico?
How's he doing?
Your boy Chico's
turning into a little punk-ass
'cause that Gitano
doesn't have a fucking clue about dogs,
and neither do you.
What's up, Chico?
How's it goin', bud?
Tell me, did you miss me,
you little twerp?
Hey, what's up, my bro?
Gitano, what's up, dude?
Whatcha doin'?
Just here, with this guy.
- Hey, he looks good, yeah?
- Good.
- He's gotten fat.
- What are you talkin' about?
I keep his intake in check, bro.
You gotta watch out
because he eats everything he sees.
Don't feed him any of that shit
my Gramps brings over.
I'll never give him
what your Granddad gives me.
That shit's more radioactive
than Chernobyl, man.
Any old shit he finds
ends up in his garden.
I'd rather he do that
than be cooped up at home all day.
Shall we take him for a walk or what?
Where'd he go?
Dude, I have no fucking idea
where he went.
Where the hell is that dog?
He always does this.
- Think he ran to that road up there?
- Ah, no. He'll be back.
Chico!
Chico!
Chico, come!
- There he is. Chico!
- Chico! Come!
Chico, come on!
- Come!
- What's up, Chico? Come on.
- Hey, hey. Hey.
- Come here.
- Come here.
- Aw.
Nice goin', buddy.
Where did you run off to,
you filthy mutt?
Asshole.
You know, from up there,
we must look like--
- Like tiny ants.
- Right?
That's what I'm sayin', bro.
Well, guess what, if they can see this,
I shit on their worm-eating ancestors,
- rich-ass motherfuckers.
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey Chico, what's up?
- What an idiot.
Huh?
- What can I get you?
- A rum and cola.
Hey, can I ask you a favor?
Of course.
Can you tell your friends
that they're douchebags?
I mean,
I already tell them that every day.
Yeah, but I'm sick of them talking
about how they're fucking my friend.
If they want to brag about something,
they can brag about their adult acne.
You're talking about Manuel, aren't you?
That guy there.
He's always had a complex
about his acne.
It's better now, though.
Better?
Yeah. You should see him
when he breaks out.
You can't tell his nose from his face.
He looks like a potato.
- Really?
- Swear to God.
You're havin' fun, no?
He was telling me about his friend.
Huh?
We know each other, bro?
We don't.
You sure?
Your face looks familiar.
Maybe from the gym.
Oh, shit, you're right.
How 'bout you come by the gym
tomorrow and we can chat?
What do you want to talk about?
We can talk about how hot Estrella is.
- Sound good?
- Relax, will you? Don't get all macho.
What? Isn't that true?
It's true, I am hot.
But that's for me to say, so shut up.
Okay, fine, chill out.
What's your name, buddy?
Ángel.
Angelito.
Is she hot or isn't she?
Why don't you cut the bullshit? My God!
- Relax.
- I'm very relaxed.
I'm just asking the kid a question.
Is she or isn't she hot?
Yeah.
She is hot.
- She's super hot.
- I'm done with this!
Why don't you idiots
go fuck each other up.
Okay, then, Angelito.
Tomorrow, I'll be there at the gym,
ready to kick your ass!
Be there! Don't be a pussy!
So, you wanna tell me why we're here?
- Did I ask you to come?
- What do you expect me to do?
Leave you alone to get your ass beat?
Well, my other friends
were fine with that.
'Cause they're dicks, man.
I'm your friend,
and I don't want them to fuck you up.
Well, it's my business.
After that guy
smashes in your face,
you really think
Estrella's gonna take care of you?
I guess that motherfucker
didn't even show up.
If he's not comin',
I guess we're done here, no?
We're done?
- Getting a little ahead of yourself, huh?
- Fuck you, dude.
All right, Angelito, get in.
No?
Got something better to do
like jerk your friend off?
No, don't do it, bro.
Look, Pintas, that one's hot.
The four-by-four, okay.
- You brought the jimmy?
- Got it, man.
You really threw a punch yesterday,
huh, Angelito?
I wasn't expecting it.
What's this?
What do you think?
Mm-hmm.
If you want out...
just tell me right now, okay?
Don't you fuck it up for me later.
We've got three minutes
before the police arrive.
We've gotta go all-out. You with me?
I'm with you.
Awesome.
Angelito, you're with me.
Go, go, go!
Let's go, quick!
Come on, last one!
Come on, guys, let's go!
Shit, shit.
Come on, guys! Someone's coming!
Come on, let's go!
Put the bags in the trunk! Hurry!
Man, fuck this!
Hey, the car!
Take the M-30 Highway.
Turn here! Turn right here! Go! Go!
Why aren't they following?
They're waiting on the other side!
- The fuck?
- Let's go!
Here! Up the ramp!
Go, go, go!
Guys, go, go, go!
- Have fun at the wedding, okay?
- Of course we will.
I'm off, ladies.
- Encarni, remember to pay Saray, okay?
- Okay.
Have fun, girl.
See you tomorrow.
- What the hell is up with you?
- With me?
- Wanna tell me?
- Tell you what?
That you're hooking up with Estrella.
What the hell? Are you stupid, bro?
I'm stupid? Then, what's that chick
hanging around the garage for?
Thought you settled everything with Poli.
Don't fuck around and get
my uncle's garage burned down.
Shut up.
No way, girl.
I don't know.
Who knows, hon? Why don't you ask her?
Okay, then, tell her to go for you.
Look, I'll call you later.
Yeah.
See you.
What's up?
'Sup?
Are those the cleanest overalls they had?
It's his.
How'd you know I was here?
You know, people talk, quite a lot.
And how'd you know
about the hair salon?
Same reason.
I'm sure Nando's telling
half the neighborhood about this.
Not like there's much to tell.
Yeah, I know.
It's all pretty clear, right?
What makes you say that?
Because I got in his car?
- For example.
- Well... I'm here now, right?
Yeah, now you're here.
I have no idea what's going on.
And you? What's your deal?
First, you fight like two macho shitheads.
Two minutes later,
you're robbing a store
as if nothing happened.
- Yeah, it happens.
- Yeah.
Then, why did you roll up to the salon
looking all stupid?
I was looking stupid?
Do I look stupid to you?
Are you gonna play
with the doll or the ball?
You've gotta choose, as they say.
Yeah.
And if I need the ball
so the doll'll want to play with me?
Oh, my God!
All right...
make a stupid face.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Very good, perfect.
Need to be careful.
Always.
Why don't you ask
one of your buddies for my number?
I'll send you the photo.
Okay?
Asshole.
Hard times are finally over, Angelito.
We're goin' for the quality shit now.
What's the deal, Ángel?
You know you've messed up big-time, no?
Robbery, attempted escape,
resisting arrest.
- Not resisting.
- No?
Crashing into two patrol cars
doesn't count?
But I didn't crash into anyone.
Really?
So, how come your friends
are saying otherwise?
You still don't get it, do you?
They rope in some sucker like you,
and when things go bad,
the newbie takes the fall.
And it's the newbie who gets caught
on camera with a stolen car.
What do you want?
For you to wise up, man.
You give me a good statement here,
and the names
of everyone you were with,
explaining they were the ones
who put you up to this.
All right?
It says here you don't have any parents.
That so?
Live with your grandpa?
That sort of thing?
Judge'll definitely
take that into consideration.
I'm not saying you're gonna
get off easy, but, who knows?
Things could turn out pretty well for you.
This funny to you?
What's so funny?
That you've only got me.
Which means you ain't got shit.
He's got 20 arrests, two prison sentences,
three robberies pending trial.
I don't even need to see his face here.
I know it was him
just by the way he walks.
You want to be like that?
'Cause if that's what you want,
you're on the right path.
And by keeping your mouth shut,
you're just screwing yourself.
Got a smoke?
Psst! Hey, Cosme,
take a walk, you're being a pain.
Take a hike, you're always messin'
with the fuckin' newbies, man.
Get out of here, bro.
Was he asking you for money?
Don't mind him, the dude's fuckin' crazy.
Like half the guys in here, I guess.
Being alone messes with you, bro.
My name's Motos.
Well, my real name's Matías,
but my friends say
I'm always takin' people for a ride.
Maybe 'cause I know
how to explain things and they don't.
And you?
Ángel.
You know Poli, no?
Relax, my bro, I know him too,
we've worked together before.
And?
He wants to get you out of here.
Look, here's what you gotta do.
Got a lawyer?
Court appointed.
Might as well not have one.
Go call your lawyer right now,
and dump his weak ass.
Once you've done that,
you're gonna take this here
and call this number.
Her name's Mercedes and she's legit.
She takes care of us.
Okay? Just trust me.
- Later, bro.
- Thanks.
Hello, Ángel.
I'm Mercedes. Pleasure.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Well...
we were not so lucky
with the camera at the gas station.
Unlucky, yeah.
A coincidence that only I got filmed, no?
What do you mean?
Maybe one of these assholes
needed someone
to show their fucking face
at the gas station.
Don't know. Maybe.
And maybe someone
should've thought carefully
before playing with the big boys.
Don't you think?
Yeah.
Ángel, I've seen
the footage from the gas station.
You might as well
have waved at the camera.
Okay?
I mean, I don't know what the police
told you or what you told them...
I told them nothing.
Perfect. Awesome.
You don't have to say anything.
What matters is those images tie you
to the unauthorized use of a vehicle.
But since you were never
inside the jeweler's...
they have nothing to connect you
to the other charge.
Understand?
The car's one thing, jeweler's another.
That means another inquiry, case report.
Mmm?
- Make sense?
- Yes.
If you haven't talked,
they don't have anything on anyone.
Okay?
I'll request bail
when we go to court.
Money's not an issue.
Your friend's got it.
- So, what now?
- There's nothing else.
And you'll be out of here soon.
Just keep your head down
and stay out of trouble.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Come on, get in, little bro.
Check it out, Angelito, the guys and I
got a little homecoming present for you.
Here you go. Try it on.
Come on, bro,
stop fucking with me, okay?
I'm trying to stay out of trouble.
Hear that, Pintas?
He doesn't want any trouble.
Yeah, yeah, stayin' out of trouble?
- Damn, bro.
- What's this guy's deal?
No fucking idea, but it smells
like someone's diaper needs changing.
Yeah, smells like shit,
but we'll sort it out in a sec.
- Go ahead, put that shit on him.
- Hey!
Stop fuckin' around, dude.
- You with me or what?
- For fuck's sake!
What the fuck are you doing?
- Calm down, Angelito.
- Easy, Angelito.
What the fuck?
- You got your ID?
- Yeah, I have it.
Get ready,
we're goin' on a trip, Angelito!
Yeah!
That jewelry store,
we cleared them the fuck out.
Hey, in two days,
if you have even one bill left,
I'm burning it, okay?
Oh, yeah, baby!
What the hell are you doing out here, bud?
Not happenin'.
No, no, no, no.
Get over here. Get over here.
Get over here. We're gonna have fun.
You don't remember me, do you?
- Sole, from high school.
- Sole?
- Soledad Manchado.
- Holy shit! Manchado!
Oh, shit, of course.
I mean, it was pretty rough for me too.
You used to be so scrawny.
- You've totally changed, huh?
- Well, you've changed too.
We have to pay, right?
I didn't know you worked here.
- Sometimes, they call me up.
- Right.
And the hairdresser's?
They're closed at night.
Didn't know that?
What's wrong?
Are you mad at me?
- No, not at you. Why?
- I don't know.
You said I had to choose.
Yeah. And you obviously
chose really fucking great, dude.
Yeah.
And you?
And me?
I heard you broke up with Poli.
Your friend is psycho, dude.
Thinks I have to be with him.
Not gonna happen.
He hurt you?
No.
He didn't hurt me,
if that's what you're thinking.
- Better not find out--
- You'd better not find out?
God, help me.
- Hey, it's your buddies.
- Yeah, I see them.
- Off you go.
- I wanna stay, though.
What's up, Nando?
- Hey, what's up, girl?
- How's it goin'?
Hurry, get in. Come on. These phones
aren't gonna boost themselves.
See you around.
You're a pain in the ass, dude.
Let's see...
- Here we have 300, huh?
-350.
You sure?
I counted 300.
Julio.
Do me a favor
and count those phones again.
The white ones.
We're just gonna assume it's 350,
like you were saying.
Well, there are 350.
Mmm.
Here's what I can offer you.
Nah, come on, Marcelo.
What the fuck is that?
Okay, little Poli,
look here.
You see all those boxes over there?
They're phones too.
And you wanna know what?
In a month, they're gonna come out
with new ones that are better,
and these won't be worth shit.
Not even Gypsies will want 'em.
See what I'm sayin'?
Marcelo!
One second.
Who's that guy?
- Hey, there.
- That's Rogelio, bro.
He runs this whole thing.
He's got this-- this scrapyard,
car inspection garage, a strip club.
And who knows what else?
He's the fucking don.
- What happened?
- Francisco...
You know that girl?
From school.
That's his daughter, dumbass.
Did you fuck her?
Let's go say hi.
Dude, don't do it. Ángel.
Damn, Ángel.
Who's he?
Good afternoon.
Mr. Rogelio, right?
- Ángel.
- Pleasure.
Pleasure's mine.
You saw how he looked at you, huh?
He's not fuckin' happy
that you know his daughter.
Maybe we should try
striking out on our own, though.
Nah, bro, you heard them,
they're up to their ass in phones.
- So, we'll take 'em elsewhere.
- No can do, okay?
Not gonna fuck with this guy.
He's the buyer.
What if he's not?
That motherfucker's got contacts, bro.
He's got eyes everywhere.
Highway patrol, policemen...
You try and mess with this guy,
and they'll be on your ass forever.
You follow?
Come on, cheer the fuck up, man.
We're gonna score
some real good shit tonight.
I can't tonight, bro.
Hello!
How are you, Chico?
Hey.
Here, take this, he really loves it.
Tastes good, Chico?
So handsome.
Amazing he's letting you pet him.
Greyhounds are anti-social.
He must like you.
How 'bout that, Chico?
Prettiest girl came to see you, huh?
I can't believe it, dude.
What's that?
That you're going to prison tomorrow.
Well, then, tell that to the judge,
see if he listens to you.
Maybe your little angel face
will get you off.
What face is that?
That face you have
when you look at Chico.
You make that face,
they'll drop the whole thing.
You know?
Would you do conjugal visits?
In prison?
I think you have to be married, no?
You always get this romantic
after the first fuck?
Hold on.
What's up, Ángel?
I'm over here at the lot.
So, what now?
- You're there?
- I am, but they want 1,000 more.
Fucking assholes.
So, what now, bro? We doin' it?
What do you think?
Okay, I'll call you back.
This is it.
Could you give it a fuckin' rest?
- I'm not doin' anythin', dude.
- Come on now, man.
You're basically laughin' in their faces.
Trust me, bro, I'm very tempted to.
The thing is, we checked...
Ángel.
The fingerprint evidence from the car
hasn't come in yet.
It hasn't come in?
- They didn't do it?
- The car's missing.
It's not in the warehouse.
So, what now?
What do you think?
I don't know.
- But if the car's not there--
- No car, no case.
AG's office has dropped the charges.
You're fuckin' free, my dude!
Ángel, a minute?
This kind of stuff
really pisses them off, okay?
They'll get you next time.
Be careful.
Fuckin' yes!
Tomorrow, they're gonna come
looking for at least half.
Gotta be tonight.
And the keys?
- They're in the safe.
- Well, fuck me.
I'm putting everything on the line.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, man!
Come on, hurry. Everyone, take one.
Estrella!
Down here!
Shut up, douchebag!
Come on! Come down!
Lady, go down there, already!
So the rest of us can get some sleep!
Go for fuck's sake!
Hey, what's up?
You fuckin' crazy?
God, just come down!
- That's right, girl, go down!
- Go fuck yourself.
Come on.
What's up with you, dude?
- Just wanted to see you, girl.
- Yeah, well, me too,
but you could've just used your phone.
- Come on, man, shut up!
- Shut up!
Hey, Lusito, shut the fuck up.
Leave me alone.
Didn't know you lived here.
You trying to be the big man
in the 'hood, or what?
Come on, hop in.
And what if I don't, asshole?
Say you're sorry.
Sorry.
Shh-shh, shh.
What's that?
A lotus flower.
It's pretty.
It grows in garbage,
in the sewage, in stagnant water.
But she never gets dirty.
I'm going to tell Poli about us.
As of tonight, I'm going solo.
Well, that's really
gonna piss him off a lot.
Okay, well, then, fuck Poli.
Don't get too cocky.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm not gonna get hurt.
I promise you.
Hey, Angelito.
What's goin' on?
Tell me where the fucking cars are.
Rogelio heard about it.
He thought it was me.
You set up a side gig?
The fuck's going on?
Somebody gave me the code.
So, who did you go with?
You used my guys without telling me?
Your guys?
It's every man for himself.
"For himself"?
Fine, tell me that next time
I get Mercedes cash to bail you out.
Okay, smart-ass? Had you forgotten that?
It's you who put me there.
Had you forgotten that?
Yeah, I put you there,
and I did everything else.
I taught you everything, dumbass.
Well, then...
we can keep on working together.
If something comes up.
You can go fuck yourself.
Is that what you want, Angelito?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Fuckin' fine, bro.
Fuckin' fine.
If I were you, I'd watch out.
Remember what I told you?
It's not good to piss off Rogelio.
And he doesn't fuck with guys
who go it alone.
Police!
Police!
Go!
Clear!
Clear!
Clear!
Damn Rogelio!
Did you see the bullshit
that motherfucker did?
They went to Nando's place too.
- Find anything?
- Couple of watches.
God fucking damn it!
I told him, if he wants something,
he needs to buy it.
This ain't legit. We can't work like this.
- We gotta hold back.
- Hold what back? Fuck that!
We're gonna go beat that fucker's ass--
We can't do that, Gitano, okay?
That guy's fucking untouchable.
Untouchable? He's not untouchable.
Let's go burn down
his supply unit and scrapyard.
I'm telling you, you can't do that.
The order didn't come
from the cops here.
The order came from the top,
from the head honcho.
God damn it, that jerk Rogelio
really does have a nice little setup.
- What the hell's going on here?
- Three months of surveillance...
You've fucked up the operation.
Who authorized the search?
Mm-hmm.
Okay...
totally screwed.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Come in.
Mercedes,
I really need him, okay? Yeah?
They're two fucking watches.
Can't we say
they didn't come from that jewelry store?
Ángel, these pieces
are worth over 3,000 euros, okay?
They've got registered serial numbers.
They know which jewelry store
they're from.
Just make something up.
Tell 'em it was
an illegal search or something.
I'm sorry,
but they've really got him by the balls.
Don't you know anyone
in the courthouse to talk to?
No, Ángel, no. They wouldn't allow that.
This is my job, you know?
Ángel?
Is this how you're gonna get her back,
huh, by beating her up?
Don't fuck with me, you prick.
Why's that? 'Cause you think I owe you?
I basically sucked your dick,
you fuckin' faggot!
You think I'm gonna stop, huh?
You wanna fuckin' bet on it, faggot?
Don't move!
I said, don't move!
Come on, get up!
Where is he?
He just went out, about five minutes ago.
You've really lost your head.
He'll lose his fuckin' head
if he touches her.
What are you, a couple of kids?
You're gonna go screw everything up?
For what?
For a girl? Don't be stupid, Ángel.
We're talking. Where are you going?
Look, I've gotta go figure my shit out,
so can you get off my ass?
- Ángel.
- Okay, Mercedes,
just tell that dipshit
to leave me alone.
Tell him to stay the fuck out of my way.
Jesus!
Here we go!
Hey, man! Fancy seeing you here.
I need to ask a favor.
- Good evening, Mr. Rogelio.
- Good evening, Manolo.
I'm working
with one of my friends, and we're...
- trying to break into the trading thing.
- Huh.
Didn't know you were coming,
so we started.
- Don't worry, I already ate.
- Look, Sole's friend is here.
Ángel, is that right?
- Oh, you know each other?
- A little.
"Rogelio, check this out,
could you give us a hand
with all this gear?"
"Hey, Rogelio, how much
would you give me for this cologne?"
And Rogelio handles the cologne.
He handles it all, even if he hates it.
Even if cologne's
coming out of his fuckin' ears.
Or sports gear or whatever.
And why?
You've gotta work with people.
That's just how it is.
Every man gets his day.
- Yes or no?
- Yes, but Rogelio--
But then...
Then, suddenly,
something big, something good...
You get an amazing deal.
And Rogelio's fucked over.
Now, it's worth trying to see
if the deal works out better.
And that's not good.
Because in this life, Ángel...
as my father said,
one must be grateful...
but above all...
you must not be another asshole.
Mr. Rogelio,
I didn't sell the cars to anyone.
Perfect, then, bring them to me,
problem solved.
I need them.
You need seven luxury cars?
- Trying to have a car show?
- That's why I'm here.
To discuss what we're going to do.
Ah, you think
that you're going to tell me what to do.
No.
You're going to tell me.
I'm sick of going out
and hustling every night.
What do you spend on warehouses,
storing these products that don't sell?
- Or on security?
- That's my concern.
Well, mine too.
If, from now on, I bring you
exactly what you ask me to get.
- What I ask you to.
- That's right.
You tell me what they're asking for...
and I'll bring it.
By the time you get it, it's sold.
Deliver, get paid, and done.
That simple.
That simple.
That simple.
Cheers.
Come on!
Let's get out of here!
Let's go! Don't shoot! Hurry! Let's go!
Just-- Just stay calm.
Stay calm. I'll call the police!
Trip the alarm!
Let's go!
Hands in the air, bro. Get back!
What's going on?
Now! Right now! Now! Now!
Hands up! Up!
Back against the wall!
Where are the keys?
The fucking keys!
Don't move a fuckin' finger.
I'll blow your brains out! Don't you move!
The keys! Give me the keys!
Come on! One minute!
Go, go, go! Fuckin' hurry!
Hey! What the hell is-- What's all this?
Come on, hurry!
Up against the fucking wall!
Let's go.
Come on!
- Move! Fuckin' move!
- The hard drives!
Just stick 'em in the bag.
Okay, let's go!
Let's go!
Worked out.
Oh, man, that was fuckin' sick!
- You see that?
- So dope, bro.
WHAT'S UP?
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIDE NOR HAIR OF YOU...
Hurry!
We look fuckin' cool!
I GOT IT CUT
Isn't this awesome?
What a fuckin' entrance!
HAHAHAHA
- Hang on. Rewind a little.
- Thirty seconds!
Okay.
Twenty seconds!
What the fuck
did you just put in your pocket, bro?
What's wrong, Motos? A ring for my girl.
No big deal. I'll give it to her today.
We said we weren't gonna take anything.
Not a damn thing.
If you want something,
go to the fucking store and buy it.
- I know you got the money.
- I do have it, more than you.
- And?
- If I want something, I take it.
You know I'm still facing theft charges,
and you pull the exact same shit.
See? I'm not the only one who's done it,
so why's he got a problem with me?
Shut your fuckin' mouth.
Let me tell you, know what happens now?
- What happens, Motos?
- Know what'll happen?
You realize, those fuckin' rings,
they've got registered serial numbers.
Those numbers don't matter,
'cause I live in one house,
she lives in another.
You think the police is stupid?
How do you think they catch people?
Which people?
People like you? What'd you pay?
"People-- " You stupid motherfucker,
I'll kick your ass!
- Hey, stop! Hey!
- Fuck you!
Calm the fuck down right now!
- Come on.
- Calm down!
And you're a fucking asshole, okay?
You're gonna leave the fucking ring here.
Got it?
Is that clear?
- Yes.
- That's right.
All this for a ring? You're up my ass?
- Because of a fuckin' ring.
- Leave the ring. Get over it.
WHATCHA UP TO, CUTIE?
MEET UP?
COME AROUND TODAY
Tomorrow is my sister's Communion.
Mm-hmm?
And, well, you're coming, no?
My dad's invited you.
Your dad wants me there?
Come on, fine,
- I'm the one who wants you there.
- Ah, I see!
But my dad said you could.
He thinks you're awesome.
Of course he does.
With the money I'm making him,
why wouldn't he?
- My cousins think you're hot.
- I hope they don't hit on me.
Well, if they hit on you,
I'll rip out their lashes.
Who's that with your dad?
- He's a cop.
- A cop?
- Mmm.
- Haven't seen him.
Yeah, because he's a police chief,
from Canillas.
- He's not on the street.
- Yeah.
I'm going to see my sister.
- Okay.
- One minute.
- Yes?
- Mercedes.
I just heard the news that they got Poli.
I told you,
I'm not discussing this with you, okay?
Yeah.
But did he call you or not?
I can't get him out
'cause he doesn't have the money for bail.
Wanted to hear that?
- Now you have it.
- What's that?
What I said, you have it.
I'll bring it today.
- Tell him it's your money, an advance.
- Don't fuck with me.
Ángel, come on.
- Yes, Mercedes. I love you too. Later.
- No, don't--
- How are you?
- How are you, Mr. Rogelio?
- Thank you for the invitation.
- My pleasure.
Hey, one other thing.
This is important.
Do you still have that lawyer?
- Mercedes?
- Yes.
Well, if you could get another lawyer,
that would be fantastic.
You know what I mean?
At least, don't talk to her on the phone,
if you catch my drift.
They tapped her phone?
Some court official is saying
that she was given money
or something like that.
This is between us.
Okay.
Look.
That's how I like to see her...
with a smile on her face.
Do you know what I mean?
Don't screw that up, okay, Angelito?
Okay? I'm asking nicely.
Don't let me see her cry.
Mmm?
WE'RE GOING ON A TRIP
WHERE TO?
IT'S A SURPRISE
What's this?
You know that I don't like surprises.
You're gonna like this one.
What's wrong?
You've been acting weird.
What's wrong?
- Who? Me?
- Mmm.
I don't know,
like you had something to tell me.
Are you sick of me?
No, I couldn't get sick of you.
Then, what?
Hey.
What's wrong?
There's a girl.
Are you fucking her?
We're gonna get married.
Mmm...
You brought me here to tell me that?
- Is she pregnant?
- No, she's not pregnant.
So, then... you want to fucking get married.
I'm screwed.
Really screwed.
I don't know how the hell I got here.
I have no fuckin' clue.
But it's too late to go back now.
- Why? Are they threatening you?
- No, not that.
They don't need to threaten me.
I've already been on her father's bad side
and that can't happen again.
Her father?
He has loads of contacts, okay?
People who can destroy you in a second.
But if they're on your side...
- Understand?
- No. No, I don't.
Come on, it's not hard.
What do you mean, "It's not hard"?
You scared of them, need them--
Without her dad's help,
it could take years to get where I want.
- Get to where? Where do you--
- To the top.
As high up as I can.
Sky-high, huh?
Sky-high.
You motherfucker.
The fuck do you want me to do?
I want you to understand.
And what else?
And to keep fucking me, right?
That right?
Is that it?
You fucking asshole!
You motherfucking son of a bitch!
What are you lookin' at, bitch?
Son of a bitch!
Son of a fucking bitch!
Estrella!
No.
And you take me to this pretentious
fucking place just to tell me that, huh?
- Listen to me, please.
- Listen to you? I fucking listened to you.
What?
Open up!
- Estrella, please.
- You have no fuckin' sense of shame.
Come on, man.
Let's go.
Let's go!
Damn it!
They go to every club on the island,
one after the other.
What are you sayin',
they carry two mill in there?
Two mill.
On a good weekend,
it could be closer to ten.
How long
does that thing take to reach Valencia?
Five hours.
We've got five hours
to pull this whole thing off.
- Way out at sea?
- Just like Sandokan, bro.
- What's up, buddy?
- Hey, Compi.
I got a pretty sweet setup this week,
and I wondered if you were free.
Nah, I can't do it, bro,
I'm not in Madrid.
- You serious, man?
- Actually, I'm in Ibiza.
- I'm working. I can't go anywhere.
- Working with that bastard?
Who the fuck cares who I'm working with?
Don't worry about that.
Money is money.
- Work's work.
- What, stealing jewelry from an old lady?
What old lady?
Turn the news on tomorrow, you'll see.
You're gonna lose your shit.
You can't stay down here.
Stay up on the deck
until we've docked.
And now we just wait.
They'll have to make a move at some point.
Angelito, I saw some cops on either side.
And there's gonna be more,
but don't worry.
Don't worry? I think we're fucked, man.
We're stuck on this boat
with a bunch of cops.
You need to chill, okay?
We're going ahead with the plan.
Okay.
Let's see if I can get
any money from this thing.
- You're not gonna get shit.
- It's empty, man.
There's a pool up on the top deck,
so maybe we can check it out after lunch.
Fernando, they're headed toward the stern.
- Are these cameras for the cargo?
- Yeah.
Something's up.
- What?
- He's talking to some hippie guy.
I'll give you 200 for the backpack.
Three hundred.
Okay.
He gave him a backpack.
God damn it. What's the other one doing?
He's in the gift shop.
- He's leaving with the backpack.
- Follow him.
Let's bust them right now.
No, stay there and remain calm.
We gonna bust him for takin' a backpack?
Better not be doing this
for four watches.
No, no. I don't think so.
Head up to the bridge now.
See that?
- They're both there.
- Uh-huh.
The car's gone.
What do you mean, gone?
The car we came in was right there,
and now it's gone.
Sit down.
Pull out this camera's hard drive.
God damn it!
Stay here. Don't move.
Come on, come on!
To the cargo!
The rest of you arrest Ángel.
Fuck those motherfuckers!
Vehicle's coming soon.
Let me know when it arrives.
I'll bring it over.
- Did the security guard recognize them?
- No.
He said they paid him 10,000 euros
to use the last week's footage,
but it wasn't them.
He gave us a description,
but there's no match.
Go with the other guy,
see if you can get him to talk.
You know, I warned you.
Warned you when you still had time,
but you didn't listen.
I must be an idiot.
Exactly.
That's what you are, a fucking idiot.
Another idiot who only cares
about robbing and fucking around.
But you know the worst, Angelito?
You think you're smarter than everyone,
and, well, you're not.
Gotta be hard for you, huh, Duque?
What's that?
Showing up every fuckin' day,
having to watch those so-called idiots
living the high life,
driving around in their fancy cars
and buying houses you can only dream of.
That said, you get your kicks,
'cause once in a while,
your boss comes over,
and gives you a little pat on the back,
and says, "Well done, Duque,
you're doing an amazing job
holding down the fort, you're a machine.
Keep it up, okay?"
But in the meantime...
we're getting all the ass...
and getting fucked up,
and we're laughing at you
right in your stupid fucking face.
Enough, take this clown away
before I beat his ass.
Please, Mercedes...
write this number down or memorize it.
Okay?
Then call it
and tell Estrella what happened.
They're being really strict
about calls this time.
I already spoke to her.
She has nothing to say to you.
- Did she call you?
- No.
I called her.
I didn't know where you were,
and I had to find you.
I'm an asshole.
Yes.
We agree on that.
You have to tell her to come see me.
I need to talk to her. I need to fix this.
Ángel, she asked me to make it very clear
that she's done with you.
Yeah, but were those her exact words
or your interpretation?
"Tell him to let me move on with my life...
and to go fuck himself."
Her exact words.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
You have to think of yourself.
This is a messy situation.
It really is.
How is it messy?
They still have nothing on us.
A guy can't go to Valencia?
Look, they're pissed off, okay?
You've really made them angry.
As of now,
the judge is admitting the evidence.
But, I mean, I don't think
this is going to go anywhere.
There's something more important, Ángel.
That Gitano called.
It doesn't look good.
Hey.
Gitano, you've been in there
a fucking hour.
Coming.
Don't move!
Hey, hey, come on, relax!
Get down!
God fucking damn it!
- Calm down.
- Don't move!
Calm down, asshole. Calm down.
Well, did you see their car?
We didn't see it.
They tied us up.
It took hours to get the ropes off.
They knew about the house
or they followed you.
No. Nobody followed us.
We're not that fuckin' dumb.
We drove around
40 times before goin' in.
Then, think a little harder, God damn it.
When we were getting ready,
they must've paid us a visit.
Those assholes must've been
watching us the whole time.
So, that must mean
that anywhere we've been--
They've been there too.
Oh...
The cameras at the port.
We have the hard drives.
Right there, that's us.
That goddamn motherfucker!
- Fucking damn it!
- He is fucking dead, that motherfucker!
Mercedes, you've got to find Poli.
No one's seen him anywhere.
Must be hiding.
Talk to him.
Okay?
Tell him we're gonna work things out,
that we're gonna split the money.
Ángel, I can't.
Both of you are my clients.
Yeah, Mercedes,
I know we're both your clients, I know.
But either we do things my way,
or I'm gonna kill him.
You understand?
Ángel...
you shouldn't talk like this,
especially in here.
Listen, I'm getting out of here.
And I'm getting married, okay?
I don't want bad blood.
But if that motherfucker's
trying to go to war against me,
I'll give him a war.
I'll give that motherfucker
such a fuckin' war
that he'll wish he never knew me.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
We have
two suspects in custody.
Okay.
Poli, he was in on the heist.
He's in Ibiza.
I talked to Mateo, he's tapping
the lawyer's phone for another case.
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.
Get the unit together.
One sec.
What is it?
Business.
Won't let me have my wedding day in peace.
- Oh, no, Ángel, come on.
- I won't be long.
I gotta sort shit out.
I'll be back, though.
Stop the car.
Sorry, okay?
I love you.
What's this about, Ángel?
I just had to see you.
On your wedding day?
I'm a dick.
I really fucked up, but I still--
- No.
- Please.
I can't stop thinking about you.
- Let's get away from here.
- No.
- Let's just go.
- No!
- Shut up!
- Estrella...
- I need you.
- Now you need me?
- Yes.
- Now you need me?
What about her dad?
- I don't care about him.
- Now you're not scared of her dad?
Let's go where he can't find us.
- You want to run away?
- I do.
No. You say this now,
you wanna run away,
but once we're there,
you'll suddenly remember all the reasons...
She's calling you, can't you hear?
She's calling you,
and you're telling me this childish--
- Then, why'd you meet me?
- What?
- Why'd you come--
- Don't do this to me.
I've worked my ass off
to get to where I am,
and I'm not just gonna give it all up--
- You should go now.
- I can't, Estrella.
- You have to go.
- Not without you.
Promise me that we'll talk again.
Please, just promise you'll hear me out.
Go on.
- Go on.
- Promise me we'll see each other again.
Or I'm not going.
Yes?
Hold on, say that again, please.
We have a lot of new shipments coming in.
We'll see how it works out.
Damn it, where the hell were you?
I'm sorry. I-- I'm really sorry.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
Jesus...
They got Poli.
The police got him.
- They accuse him of the ferry robbery.
- And the money?
- They don't have it. They can't find it.
- What are you going to do? Go to Ibiza?
I don't know, Ángel.
I don't know what to do.
What should I do? Tell me.
You asked me to make that call,
didn't you?
- He's been arrested now.
- And?
How long have you known?
Known what?
They're tapping my phone.
And you know it,
and you said nothing, asshole.
If that's how you wanna see it,
that's not my problem.
You didn't want to make a deal.
You wanted
the police to do the work for you...
to arrest him.
You're using us all,
and worst of all, using me.
No, Mercedes,
I'm not using you at all, I'm paying you!
So, why don't you get off my ass...
and remember who pays you.
'Cause that's what you want, right?
To keep getting paid.
That's it, right?
Ángel.
What?
Your name came up
in that conversation.
They don't like you.
They're coming for you.
Now you know.
Thanks a lot, Mercedes.
- I'll call you later to settle this?
- No, do not call me.
I'll be calling you.
Just trust me, okay?
As you wish.
- Poli!
- Get down!
Watch out!
- Please, no... No! Please!
- Come on.
- Please, no. Please, stop!
- Get back!
Don't!
Oh, shit!
Come on!
Go, go!
Shit!
Damn it!
7363...
7363...
7363...
I can't hear him.
Fucker won't spend three days
kicking and screaming.
In the sun with no water, gotta be fried.
Open it, let's see that face.
You fuckers!
Fuck you, you motherfuckin' piece of shit!
Fuck you!
Rot in hell, asshole!
Choice is yours.
Grab it.
TWO YEARS LATER
Who's the cutest little guy
in the whole world?
Here, little guy.
That's it.
- Ugh.
- Here.
Here.
Hey, what's up?
- Oh, baby.
- What about your dad?
Probably mad.
You know he's not into the shop thing.
No, of course not.
Strip clubs are more his thing.
Ángel.
I'll talk to him.
Go, Ángel!
Whoo!
- It's really good to see you, Mercedes.
- Angelito.
Thanks for inviting me.
Are you still mad?
It's all good, Ángel.
Or, I wouldn't be here.
It's so good to see you.
You too.
This is what you wanted, no?
Legit business.
It's all legit.
You'll need a few places
to give you an out from you-know-what.
- Bit by bit.
- Yes.
If you need any help,
I've got someone who could lend a hand.
Powerful people,
people who move money for a living,
who launder it.
That would be really amazing.
Right.
Can I call you on Monday?
Yeah, Monday's perfect.
Hold on a sec.
What the hell is going on?
What do you think?
Stay calm. This party is not for you.
You don't have shit on me.
Oh, yeah?
Go ask your bank's branch manager that.
- But you can't open a bank safe--
- Shh.
You sure can
if you've got a court order like this one.
Charge is possession
of undeclared capital,
possible money laundering...
We've got it all.
You've certainly got a lot
to answer for, Angelito.
- What do we do?
- Nothing, don't worry, go home.
- I'll take care of it, okay?
- Okay.
I'll see you at the station.
Couldn't have picked
another time to do this?
Yeah, we could have.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
This can't happen.
I've got the store packed--
I'll go see the safe now.  Hang on.
Hey, listen...
Put down your cameras!
Put away that camera!
What's good, Angelito?
It's been a while, huh?
Man, that's a cool tattoo.
I didn't know you were in here.
Pretty weird
that your lawyer didn't tell you.
Hey, uh...
is it true what they're saying?
I have no fuckin' clue
what they're saying.
The police...
they say they found all the money.
Now, you're here for hiding it.
What the hell do you want?
To talk.
Tell your buddy to leave,
and we'll talk about whatever you want.
Wait for me outside.
Can I sit down?
You really fucked me over, you know?
- You're the one who robbed me after I--
- After you what?
After you bailed me out of jail?
And not just that time, right?
All those other times
Mercedes loaned me money too...
Fuckin' bitch.
- She shouldn't have told you anything.
- Yeah.
You know, it was 'cause she was scared
that once I found out,
I would come for you.
And was she right?
I'm going to pay it back.
All of it,
down to the last fuckin' dollar.
How's that?
From my share...
of something you're gonna
help me out with.
How's that sound?
Marcos.
These guys are the ones
I told you about.
Limón told me
you guys wanna talk business,
- but there's one problem, bro.
- What's that?
I don't ever do business with strangers,
and I don't know you, so, see ya.
500 million.
The same amount the cops took from you.
Where did you hear that?
Limón told me...
that someone had a big mouth,
and that the cops ended up with the cash.
But he also told me something else,
something that got me thinkin',
right, bro?
I told him the truth,
that those motherfuckers burn it.
- With what it costs to get it here--
- It's true.
And it fuckin' sucks.
But they only do it
in three places in Spain.
Until it reaches those places,
it's stored in warehouses
in the middle of nowhere...
like the one in Valencia.
Good evening.
There's a small warehouse
in the port in Valencia.
It's where they store
all the smuggled goods.
- But it's all guarded by the police, no?
- No.
It's all guarded
by a private security company.
And it's only guarded on weekdays.
No one's there Saturday or Sunday.
All that's there are cameras and alarms.
And we can easily take care of that.
- Seems way too simple, man.
- It's not.
But... with the correct strategy,
it can definitely be done.
Damn, I'm good.
Then they dump it all in a truck
and get the fuck out of there.
Have a good night.
See ya.
Marcos' friend? Get in.
Gitano's there outside.
He's waiting to get the car.
He'll handle everything.
I can do it.
Sole, don't fuck around.
You've done your job.
They're watching Gitano.
How do we know he wasn't followed?
If they were really following Gitano,
someone would've intervened already.
I'm in the clear.
Just tell me where to take it.
Sole, you need to stop fucking around.
I won't beat her ass,
if that's what you think.
I know you meet there.
You make up a story
and go fuck her there for a few days.
But that doesn't matter now.
Give me the address,
or I get out of the car and it's over.
Write down the address.
Don't enter it in the GPS.
Just heard you were coming.
The hideaway?
Over there, by the dogs.
Come here.
This way.
Here.
So, here's one...
...and the other.
You're so pretty.
Thank you.
He's got your photo on his phone.
It doesn't do you justice.
I'm not surprised he loves you.
But he married you, Sole.
Why do you think he did?
I don't know.
What do you think?
I would die for him.
Him and my son.
And he knows it.
Yeah, he does.
He made out good, huh?
ONE YEAR LATER
- Mercedes.
- Álvaro.
- How are you?
- What's up?
- All good.
- Thank you so much for seeing us today.
No problem. That's what we do.
Wait in there.
I'll be with you in a moment.
- Hang on.
- Okay. No worries.
- Can I bring you a cup of coffee or water?
- No, nothing, thanks.
Ángel, would you like anything?
We're good, thank you.
They're like ants.
All right, Ángel...
let's say you have some capital
from a certain source,
and which, for now, we'll just say
is difficult to account for.
- Would you agree?
- Yes.
Good.
You'd be able to divert it
to an offshore account?
Yes, we arrange it in such a way that
the money trail is completely untraceable.
Right?
We set up different companies,
which you wouldn't be named the owner,
and we conduct a series of transfers
across different locations
in order to obscure the trail.
And that's that. It's all there.
Shitloads of your money in Singapore,
the Bahamas, or wherever you want.
Minus the commission.
You'd only pay
for the financial engineering.
Fine, not a penny more.
I'm not gonna con you.
Just to be clear, if I want my money,
I have to go to Singapore?
- Uh, no. No, Ángel.
- Tell him about the Chinese, mmm?
- Okay.
- They don't pay taxes, Ángel.
They have so much dirty money
they don't know what to do with it.
Let's see if I can explain. Look.
So, these guys generate
huge amounts of capital
every month. Dirty money, okay?
They have it here and want
to move it to their country
without paying any taxes at all.
So, of course, we tell them...
"What you can do,
instead of doing these transactions
every month,
making these individual withdrawals,
bit by bit, which gets tedious,
and you'll end up getting caught,
so you could leave them with me,
and I give them
however much they want, as needed.
The clients make transfers
from their accounts,
which are set up outside Spain.
You just send an email and that's it.
That amount's already in China.
- The Chinese give you the money in cash?
- That's right. Every month.
Then, all I do is send over to my clients
the money that they've requested.
No taxes, no transfers.
Tell them what you want,
they bring it to you.
Like ordering pizza.
Isn't it great?
Great?
It's fucking awesome.
- Look, that's them right there.
- We've been able to ID this guy.
First guy is, uh, Zou Xian,
and the other is Hai Zou.
Two convictions for laundering.
How do we know
they're making a move today?
- Could be scoping it out, like last month.
- No, it's today, we have intel on that.
Well, who've we got here? Hey!
Who loves Rogelio, eh?
He's a chubby guy, eh? Getting bigger.
I mean,
the little guy eats more than his dad.
Anyway, you bring the car?
Yeah.
Follow me.
- Where's Ángel?
- Park.
Don't trust the tracker.
He might've lent the car.
Confirmed?
It's him.
It's him. I see him now.
He's with his father-in-law.
Who's that one guy? The short one?
Nobody, some employee, a lawyer.
A confidante of the top guys
overseeing things.
- Have we got a room number yet?
- The reception manager told me it's 550.
Look, I know I said this a while ago...
Remember when I told you
to get rid of that bitch?
You didn't listen.
You think you're smarter than everyone,
- but you fucked up.
- If you lay one finger on her--
Hey, I think you're confused,
I'm not talking about her.
I'm talkin' about the other bitch,
the lawyer.
Mercedes?
What's going on with Mercedes?
She just left for Paris.
Doesn't want to be around
over the next few hours.
- Why's that?
- I don't know why. Do you?
Maybe it's got something to do
with that call she made.
They've still got her phone tapped
because of the case.
Really sloppy.
Talking on the phone
about the scheme with the Chinese,
the hotel where it'll happen, all of it.
And it gets worse.
Worst part is she seems to think
you're gonna try to rob these guys.
If something happens to Sole
because of your fuck-ups, Ángel...
I swear, I'll kill you.
See you later, bud.
Say bye to Grandpa, okay?
He's on the move now.
Suspect is on the move.
- No image.
- What do you mean, no image?
The camera on the fifth floor is down.
It's not working.
Go up to the fifth floor.
Autodial Sole.
Now calling Sole.
NOW
NOW
Shit!
Pick the fuck up!
Yes?
- Sole!
- I can't find the briefcases.
- Doesn't matter! Just get outta there!
- What?
Get the fuck out of there!
The police are on the way!
Found them.
No, Sole, get out!
Sole!
NOW
Motherfucker.
- A woman just left the room.
- A woman?
She's heading to the elevator
with a suitcase.
It's his wife.
She's in the elevator.
Three guys came out.
Stop them now.
Don't move! It's the police!
Put your hands against the wall.
Ángel will be here in a minute.
Let's go!
We've gotta arrest them all now!
Don't move! Hands up! Do not move!
You're now under arrest!
Detain him.
Put your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back!
We gotta keep looking.
Anything?
Look, it's gotta be here.
Well, they found her...
in the elevator, empty-handed.
You have a son.
What the hell were you thinking? Hmm?
And what are you gonna tell your father?
Are you gonna cooperate?
Did he trick you? What?
Hmm?
I want to make a call.
That's my right, no?
Yes?
Hey, Estrella,
you know who this is?
Yes.
Listen to me, we don't have much time.
I'm at the station, arrested, with him.
Go to Hotel Miguel Ángel
and pick up two suitcases.
I'm not getting involved
in all that crazy shit.
Do you want to help Ángel or not?
Like this, no.
There's gotta be another way.
Do you think I'd be calling you
if there was?
We're completely fucked
if they find that money.
Yeah, well, none of that's my problem.
He'll go to prison.
And it'll be for a long time.
What do I have to do?
Okay. When you get there,
go to the garage.
Cops will have finished their search,
so they should be gone.
There's a closet where they store
suitcases for people who've checked out.
I left an access card
by the extinguisher next to the closet.
Okay.
Inside, there should be two briefcases
on the top right.
- What then? I take 'em to the hideaway?
- Yeah, hide 'em there.
Hey, Estrella.
What?
When he gets out this time,
I want you two to leave, okay?
Take the fucking money
and then disappear.
Sole...
if I do this, that's not why, okay?
It's what he always wanted, no?
From the day we married.
That's right...
but just so we're clear,
I'll keep one part of him.
And he'll be mine.
And he has his eyes,
which is his best part.
Before you leave the parking garage,
destroy your phone card.
They could be tracking you.
The police?
My father.
