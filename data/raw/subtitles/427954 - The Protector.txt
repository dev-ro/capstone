The Jaturungkabart
were sworn to protect
the mighty royal elephants.
Why?
Elephants are so big,
who could hurt them?
The king sits on top of them.
So they must beware
of things from below.
Beware of what, Dad?
If they lost their swords,
they would use their bodies as weapons.
Throw, crush, grab and break.
What do they need
to be careful of?
I cannot tell you yet.
But I'm going to be a Jaturungkabart.
I have to know.
Not yet, Kham.
One day you will know.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Splash him, son.
Splash him.
Come on, splash him.
Splash him all over, son.
Splash him, son.
Splash him.
How do you feel, Por Yai?
Por Yai, you're so naughty!
Dad, look at him.
How was it?
Was Por Yai up to his old tricks again?
Why did Por Yai do that to you?
Oh! Splash him, come on.
Dad, I'm here.
Father, Father, Father.
Where's Por Yai going?
Let him go, son.
Pull... Pull... Pull it tight...
Lasso it.
Come on, pull. Pull it.
If I ever had the chance
to present Por Yai to the King...
...it would be the biggest
honor of my life.
At the very least, it would mean that
I upheld the name of the Jaturungkabart.
Korn...
I have something to show you.
Nice, huh?
I reckon this Songkran Water Festival
is going to be fun.
Mr. Suthep is taking care of everything.
He's throwing a huge party.
Well, his son's now a member
of government.
Hopefully he can give us back
some of our profits.
Koi, I heard they are going to check
the elephants for royal status.
Aren't you going to take your elephants
to see if they're in with a chance?
Say goodbye to Por Yai, Kham.
After Por Yai has been checked...
...we might not have the chance
to see him again.
This could be
a great opportunity for you.
There's no reason to worry.
Annual Songkran Water Festival
Mr. Koi,
...this way, please.
Hello.
Welcome.
Dad, they're here.
Hello, Mr. Koi.
- Please, come inside.
- Yes, sir.
Everything's ready.
Come in.
Go on, Korn.
Wait outside for a while.
Your father should go in alone.
This is Supoj, a friend of mine.
Hello, sir.
He takes care of this place.
He will take care
of everything for you.
Young man, would you like
a bell for your elephant?
Do you want a bell?
Do you want one?
It's for good luck.
Do you want one
for your elephant?
- How much is this one?
- That one is 40 Baht.
It's not expensive.
Buy a bell for your elephant
and get good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Let me take a look.
That's lovely.
Let's go.
BLIND BOXING
Thank you.
Come on.
Bring it here.
Wait! Wait!
Are you taking him away today?
Yes, today.
You can go back home and wait there.
I will let you know what happens later.
But...
Come on. Quickly.
Move it.
Come on.
Quickly.
Come on... Come on...
You can't take him.
Not yet.
I won't let you.
You can't.
You can't.
You can't take him.
I said you can't take him.
Force it to go.
I said you can't take him.
You old fart, I told you!
Move it. Quickly.
Look! Elephants.
Didn't you see the truck?!
Father!
Father...
What happened, Father?
- Father...
- Kham.
Check on Por Yai.
I said move!
Oracle Ceremony - To Find Por Yai
Baby, we belong together
enjoying the forest with a joyful heart.
The waterfall pours down
as if heaven was before our eyes.
Birds coo like my loving words for you.
Who the hell are you?
Do you want my foot in your mouth?
Go on. Get him.
Go get him!
My teeth!
Wait for me!
Where are Por Yai and Korn?
- Where are they?
- I don't know!
I don't know.
You don't know?
You don't know?
Johnny...
Johnny took them.
They're in Sydney.
Where is he?
Father!
Shoot!
Shoot him!
Enough.
You're hurting me.
Come on. Quickly.
Move it.
Sydney, 2 Weeks Later
What beautiful mangoes.
Hello. How are you?
They look lovely.
How much?
Do you want some?
Take some.
Take them. It's no problem.
- How much?
- Forget it.
- Are you sure?
- Just take them.
Well, okay, then.
Can I take two more?
Take them. Go on.
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.
You look like you're constipated
or something.
Hey, Tui.
You stupid prick.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
How did you know, Sarge?
You idiot. With a face like that,
who wouldn't be able to spot you?
Put the damn gun down.
Put it down!
Stay away.
If you come any closer, I'll shoot.
Shoot me if you want,
but don't forget your mother.
When she gets here,
you're in deep shit.
Don't lie to me.
My mom isn't here.
She is. Look behind you!
Come on, imbecile.
Go on, run.
Don't be such a wimp.
You idiot.
Just forget it. You idiot! Go! Go! Go!
Shit! When did that happen?
Why didn't anyone tell me?
If the NGOs truly understood
the elephant situation here,
then they wouldn't be against us.
From all the exits to the meeting room,
guards have been placed
at every 10 meters.
Uncle, I have
arranged everything for you.
I've hired Sydney's top chef
to make abalone soup.
I made it for all of you.
I hope everyone will enjoy it.
Especially you, Uncle.
You should have more of it.
This is good for your health.
It will keep you strong.
With good health,
you'll be able to look after
the family business forever.
Are you sure this is abalone?
It's bland. There's no aroma
and no sweetness.
It tastes like earthworms.
You know earthworms, right?
Slithering insects
which have 2 genders...
without being either.
So what about it, Rose?
If you can't even
provide proper food for me,
how do you expect to protect me?
For security,
it's better to let Cheng handle it.
I think this is better.
When your father was alive,
Cheng was in charge.
What you do shows
no respect to our clients.
We are negotiating
with representatives of the government.
If we unite with them,
our business will grow rapidly.
Concentrate on the restaurant
I gave you.
That's enough responsibility
for you, Rose.
That stupid old man made me lose face
in front of everyone.
You don't need to be angry or impatient.
You already have this, don't you?
I think this new fate of mine
will finally rid me of that old man.
A tricycle is faster than this.
God, you drive like a pensioner.
I didn't do anything wrong.
What are you doing here?
Oh! Are you Thai?
I'm speaking Thai.
Do you think I'm Burmese?
Did you come to Sydney
to break the law?
No, sir. I've come here to find Por Yai
and my little brother.
- You're looking for your relatives?
- Yes, sir.
- What do they look like?
- Like elephants.
Elephants?
Elephants?
Who's like an elephant in Thai town?
Come on. Let's talk about this
back at my office.
Mark!
Hello.
How's it going, Goong?
- Are your clients keeping you busy?
- Not really.
It's your fault.
You never visit my restaurant.
I'm really busy.
- There's a new promotion on.
- Yeah?
Special price at lunchtime.
- I'll go if I have time.
- Okay.
It's a Thai restaurant.
Tom Yum Goong is Thai food.
So why did they hire
a Vietnamese guy like Johnny
to be the general manager?
- Johnny! Johnny!
- Shut up!
- Okay. See you later.
- See you.
- Work hard.
- You, too.
Follow them quickly. Hurry up!
- Don't start any trouble.
- Follow that car quickly!
Quiet down! Quiet down!
Those are the people
that took Por Yai and Korn.
Don't say that.
You can't accuse someone
without any evidence.
I have a photo, but it's in the taxi.
Don't waste my time.
We'll talk at the station.
Let him go!
Where are my elephants?
Where are my elephants?
Johnny!
Johnny!
Give me back my elephants.
We are both Thais. So I'll warn you.
Don't get involved with them.
I know.
You're an ugly son of a bitch.
Kings sit upon the elephants.
Vital areas are underneath.
Enemies aim for those areas.
Soldiers protect the 4 most vital areas
of the elephants.
What are the vital areas, Dad?
One day you will know, Kham.
Tui.
What the hell are you doing?
He forced me to do it, Sarge. I...
Mark.
This is Goong.
Where are you?
I just watched the news,
and I'm worried about you.
Don't say anything.
Someone might be listening.
Can we meet?
Pla's just called me.
She has evidence which can prove
that you're innocent.
She won't see me unless I see you first.
No problem. Where?
Mark?
I'm sorry.
Ever since Johnny came here...
it has been hell for everyone.
Everyone from the waitresses
to the manager.
I don't know what to do.
They built a secret entrance
at the back of the restaurant...
for their VIP clients.
Everyone wants to know...
what goes on up there.
Maybe the relative you are
looking for is up there.
Where's Johnny?
Where are my elephants?
Where are my elephants?
What's he saying?
Where are my elephants?
Korn!
Korn!
Have you found your brother?
Korn!
Korn!
Korn!
Shit! An elephant!
A real elephant!
- How did you get here?
- Korn!
Rose, the heir to the business
should be Sim's son.
But Chao is only 13. He's still a child.
He doesn't yet have the ability
to run the family business.
Then the most suitable person
should be Kang.
He is the son of Third Aunt,
who is the younger sister
of both Sim and your father.
Um, that should be good.
Kang has just graduated
in Management from England.
He should be able to take good care
of the business.
Why don't any of you think
about how I feel?
I am also my father's child.
I have devoted everything
to this family.
I would always help Uncle
when he was still alive.
Take a good look at yourself.
You're neither a man nor a woman.
How do you expect us
to let you run the family business?
We wouldn't be able
to show our faces in public.
Kang! What's wrong with you?
Please don't scare me. Help! Help!
You! Why did you do this?
The most suitable person is dead...
What's wrong? Tell me, Chao!
...and the second is dying.
Is there anyone suitable left?
In that case,
I accept the responsibility.
I promise you all...
I will make the family business
better than ever.
I won't let you down.
I won't let my father down.
And I hope for the utmost cooperation
from you all.
Be patient, Korn.
We'll find Por Yai together.
Hey, Kham.
We can't stay here anymore.
I think we've disturbed you
enough, Father.
Thank you very much
for your gracious assistance.
Once you have stepped on fire,
no matter how far you run,
your feet will still burn.
At least we won't cause you
any problems.
I must go now, Father. Come on, Kham.
- What are you going to do now?
- I must find Por Yai.
I think that transsexual
knows something.
I think we should
go back to the temple first.
Father!
Someone, help!
Get out quickly. Go on.
Kham!
You should take the elephant
back to Bangkok.
I have connections at the port.
It would be easy for you to go back.
What about you, Sarge?
Don't worry about me.
Where's my elephant?
Where is he?
You piece of shit!
Korn!
You're scum!
Your mother's a dirty whore.
This majestic elephant...
...will enhance your dominion.
All will bow to you...
...and the power which you hold.
Korn! Korn!
Korn! Korn!
An elephant is most vulnerable
at its tendons.
If its tendons are severed,
it will fall.
Wait.
Are you okay, Goong?
Somsak, sir.
- God, are you Thai?
- Aren't I speaking clear enough?
You sarcastic piece of shit!
Elephants have represented Thailand
for many years.
We respect them as if they were
our own brothers, our family.
Thai people don't appreciate it
if anyone tries to hurt an elephant.
Actually, Thai people like peace.
But we don't like it
when people take liberties.
Kham, we have to go.
