April!
Janet!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
APRIL: You did it!
My condolences, Janet.
Because once you've reached
the top of the mountain...
Oh, shut up, Gottfried.
Spare us the aphorisms.
You're a star, Janet,
I'm proud of you... even though
I think democracy is finished.
Oh, thank you, April.
At least you're consistent.
Actually, I'm not drinking
alcohol at the moment.
Do you feel
different yet?
(CHUCKLES)
Not really.
You do look slightly
ministerial in that pinny,
in a 21st-century,
postmodern,
post post-feminist
sort of way.
- It hasn't really sunk in yet, I've been so busy.
- (PHONE RINGS)
Oh.
Hi, Mum.
You did.
Yes, you always did.
Yes, he's very proud.
He has. He's... He's been
really supportive.
Mm, I am lucky.
Listen, Mum, um,
I've got guests over.
Can I call you
a bit later?
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)
Are you sure
you don't want a...?
You are, um...
Gottfried.
Yes. Yeah.
Yes. Yes, I'm Bill.
I think.
Or I used to be.
(LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
That's... very funny.
It wasn't a joke.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
I hear you.
Please tell me you're not
meditating, Gottfried.
- Pull yourself together.
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
JANET:
April, can you?
She's so beautiful.
- Who?
- April.
- JANET: Martha.
- Oh.
I'm a very lucky man.
- Where's Janet?
- Doing a Thatcher.
Proving she can still
rustle up a canape
in the kitchen when necessary,
despite her political prowess.
Oh, Janet,
it is wonderful
and marvelous.
And it's a triumph
for womankind.
Well, for any kind,
for that matter.
At last your ailing party has
a person at the helm of Health
with principles
as well as ambition.
Well, thank you, Martha. You
look as if you really mean that.
Well, of course I do,
ya fool.
I am very proud of you.
As I know Bill is.
Letting Janet do the catering, are you?
That's good of you.
I suppose you're exhausted from all
these years of being so perfect.
- Arguable.
- Well, it was worth it, you brilliant bastard.
She's made it to the top.
- Congratulations, you old failure, you.
- (PHONE RINGS)
Behind every successful
woman, there is...
Shut up, Gottfried.
Your clichés are unbearable.
JANET: Just a few close friends,
which you are, absolutely, too.
- How about tomorrow?
- Everyone's gonna want a piece of Jan now.
They're gonna eat her alive.
Oh, don't worry about her.
Looks like a girl.
Thinks like a man.
Androgynous soul.
Always had true grit.
Sounds like me, actually.
But the difference is,
Janet actually believes
change is achievable through
parliamentary politics.
You're rather quiet
this evening, Bill.
(WHISPERING) Will you
please stop calling?
Stop it.
It's impossible to talk.
People keep coming in and out.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
(NORMAL VOICE)
Terrific! Well, um,
I'll see you tomorrow morning then.
Looking forward to it.
- (WHISPERS) Bye-bye.
- (KNOCKING)
MAN OUTSIDE: Hello?
My job. I am the gatekeeper,
by order of the minister.
- Jinny.
- Hi, April. Hi.
- You still look pretty slim.
- Has Martha arrived yet?
She's in there,
thumping your old pal.
Janet's in the kitchen,
if you want to...
No, thanks. I really need
to see Martha now.
You're missing her
that much?
Marriage really is an
insufferably smug institution.
- I like it.
- Well, Gottfried and I are separating.
This is our last supper.
Hey.
What's up?
- Excuse me?
- (WHISPERS) Three, Martha.
- Three!
- Excuse us.
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
APRIL:
So, who else is coming?
- Just Tom and Marianne.
- Hmm.
The beautiful Marianne,
the queen of spin.
And that ridiculously handsome
husband of hers.
Too bad he's a wanker banker
with mysterious ability
to make millions out of
others' misfortunes.
Why on earth
have you invited them?
She and I will be working
together from now on.
You mean
you'll be her boss.
Well. I don't actually
use that word,
but yes, I suppose so.
So she will be your underling,
taking copious notes while plotting
how to take your place one day.
She and I are on
very good terms, actually.
We'll be sharing an office now.
She's on my team.
Lucky you,
gazing on all that
genetic good fortune.
April...
Do you think
Bill's all right?
I mean, this is what
we have always wanted.
And he's always encouraged me.
But now he just seems...
- Drunk?
- Depressed.
Look.
If Dennis Thatcher
and Prince Philip
could trail behind their female leaders
without complaint, then so can Bill.
(PHONE RINGS)
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Hello?
Well, thank you. Thank you
so much for calling.
Oh, April.
Ahh. Lovely to see you.
It's been...
It's been too long.
Possibly.
Uh, are you alone?
Where's Marianne?
Marianne's been delayed,
unfortunately.
She sends her apologies.
She's gonna try and get here
for dessert.
Oh.
Marvelous.
Or-Or cheese.
- Terrific.
- Uh, coffee, perhaps.
Smashing.
Um, April, where's
the bathroom, please?
Lavatory. Kitchen.
Hostess. Host.

Oh, I hope Gottfried

Oh, yes. Marianne...
Marianne will be delayed just...
Oh, she works so hard.

- That's nice.
Um, a drink?
A drink, Tom?
No, no, no, no, no. You're busy.
Stay where you are.
No, um, can I help?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Okay.
- Where's that marvelous husband of yours, Janet?
- Well, h...
Right. Got it.
Congratulations again,
Janet.
Martha.
Look at me.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
It's wonderful,
isn't it?
- Jinny.
- (CHUCKLES)
I guess... I guess we're about
to become a collective.
Just when I'd got used to
the idea of us being a couple.
Martha...
we're going to be
a family.
Will you tell them, please?
Will you tell them
how happy we are?
(LATIN JAZZ PLAYS)
(MEN SINGING IN SPANISH)
Could you come help me
for just a minute, darling?
Are you all right?
We have an announcement.
Bill, I know you adore
that thing, but could you?
(VOLUME DECREASES)
So, everybody,
it seems that
we are expecting
not one, not two,
but three babies.
- Oh!
- MARTHA: People.
Small people.
Congratulations.
Wow!
(LAUGHING)
Wow!
- Thank you!
- Wow.
Was that a boast
or a cry for help, Martha?
I couldn't quite tell
from your tone of voice.
The miracle of conception.
Shut up, Gottfried.
Listen,
I'm going to propose
a toast to my oldest, dearest,
and... most loyal friend,
who has achieved
a rare thing, which is
why we're all here this evening,
in case anyone forgot.
Babies...
excuse me Jinny, Martha...
but babies get born every day
in extremely large numbers,
to the point of endangering
the planet and all our futures.
It's not every day, however,
that one of us
becomes a minister
in your entirely rotten
and useless opposition party.
Fuck you, April.
- Though, of course, you're right.
- What? Martha!
- (GLASS BREAKS)
- Oh!
I have never seen
that happen before.
Oh, neither have I.
God, I hope
it's not an omen.
It's just a broken window
in a door
and not a window
into anyone's soul.
(GROANS)
(PHONE RINGS)
Here.
Take mine.
I'm not really drinking
- in the circumstances, you see.
- Thanks.
Oh, perhaps
just a symbolic sip.
- What do you think, Martha?
- You're a free woman.
Am I?
To Janet.
I may not believe in
parliamentary politics,
but I absolutely do
believe in you.
- (TOM CHUCKLES)
- Thank you.
Bill.
Come on, chum.
What is it, darling?
I-I have an announcement.
Oh?
Another announcement.
Good God.
(BILL CLEARS THROAT)
Uh, turns out that...
I'm not well.
Bill.
What do you mean?
What's the matter?
I've had a diagnosis.
Um...
it's not too good, actually.
(CHUCKLES)
What kind of diagnosis?
Terminal.
Bastard.
Oh, poor ba... poor bastard.
- Yeah, I know.
- Poor bastard.
Terminal?
Did you say terminal, Bill?
Yeah. Uh,
it looks like I'm done for,
medi... medically speaking.
Why didn't you tell me?
(SOBS)
Oh, God.
- How long have you known?
- (PHONE RINGS)
(PHONE FALLS TO FLOOR)
Hmm?
What is it, exactly?
What's... What's wrong with you?
Lung, liver, leg...
- take your pick.
- So how long have you got?
Uh, no time.
No time at all.
No one knows how long
they live, Bill.
And Western doctors
know nothing at all.
So if they...
(CONVERSATION CONTINUES,
MUFFLED)
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck!
(GASPS)
I'm going to resign.
Immediately. Now.
Well, tomorrow morning. As soon as
they can find someone to replace me.
- I'm going to look after you.
- No, Janet, no.
Yes, Bill. Yes, Bill.
Of course I will.
You've supported me
every step of the way.
You gave up everything, and now
I'll do the same for you.
More! I'll do more!
(GROANS)
(COUGHS, GAGS)
Oh, Janet. Fuck.
- (GAGS)
- (DOOR SLAMS)
(RETCHING)
APRIL: You don't
really want to resign.
After all these years
of tedious effort
to get to
the so-called top...
Fuck!
(PANTING)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Needed some air.
(MUTTERS)
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
What is it
you do, again, Tom?
I work in finance.
Oh, yeah.
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, grand. Good. Good.
- You?
- Sick.
Actually...
(DISTANT HELICOPTER FLYING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(HELICOPTER APPROACHES)
Is this true? Really?
Bill?
(SNIFFLING)
I'm so sorry.
- Oh, God.
- MARTHA: Look.
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Yeah.
Let's get practical.
Bill?
- BILL: Yeah?
- Who have you seen?
Harley Street
specialist.
Hang on, hang on.
You... You went private?
- You saw a private doctor?
- I did, yeah.
Because our GP couldn't see me
for two bloody weeks.
Oh, Christ.
What did you expect, Bill?
Special treatment?
Queue jumping?
This is England!
You can't make an exception for
the husband of the minister,
especially not the husband
of the Minister of Health.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Shadow minister. But anyway, who cares?
- You do.
- No.
No, April.
This is Bill.
We must do anything we have to.
Anything. Doesn't matter.
It's only your principles.
(SNIFFLES)
BILL: Well, a specialist
saw me straightaway.
All the tests... done.
And he's sure?
He's definite?
Definite.
He said
I'm definitely done for.
Western medicine
is voodoo, Bill.
Voodoo?
Voodoo.
Hey.
I am with child.
Children plural, wasn't it?
Yes, children. Thanks entirely
to Western medicine.
Extremely Western, extremely
private, and extremely expensive.
Yeah, and worth it.
Worth every penny.
It's not all bad, Gottfried.
IVF is basically a miracle.
And I thought it was a procedure
involving a petri dish.
JINNY: Well, they give
you a load of hormones,
which is not much fun,
actually,
and the whole thing can be
pretty painful,
but it's amazing
that the procedure,
as you put it, April, can result
in new life, don't you think?
Please, stop it.
Bill says he's dying.
Not yet.
Soon.
(SNIFFING)
Listen, Bill.
Doctors are not prophets.
They are cursing you with
their so-called science,
their so-called
statistics.
Can they predict death?
No.
What do they really understand
about illness?
Nothing.
MARTHA: Oh, come on,
Gottfried, you've gone too far.
This is the land that invented
the National Health Service.
Free medical care for everyone!
- It changed the lives of millions for the better,
- (PHONE CHIMES)
and we are in the presence of one
of its most passionate guardians.
GOTTFRIED: What-What
exactly is she guarding?
These so-called doctors
do not look
at the whole man
when he's suffering.
They just try to eliminate
the symptoms of disease
with poisonous chemicals sold by pharmaceutical
companies who want to make money.
- Only money!
- TOM: Yes, yes. And why not?
Why not?
The Western medical
establishment
is ignorant and corrupt.
(PHONE CHIMES)
They're killing people
with their so-called cures.
Janet, I apologize for
my so-called boyfriend.
I cannot tolerate dogma,
even when it's partially true.
- But it's totally true.
- You can see why I'm separating, definitively,
from this... German.
Now, what does his nationality
have to do with it?
Everything,
when you know what the Nazis
did with medical ethics.
I am not a Nazi.
You're very attached
to dogma.
I am working
on my attachments.
Work?
You call that work?
Oh. You see?
Tickle an aromatherapist,
and you find a fascist.
GOTTFRIED:
I am not an aromatherapist.
I am a life coach...
and a healer.
Oh look. Let's face it:
when you're in a car crash,
you don't want a life coach,
you want an ambulance.
But even so, April, I really think
you shouldn't use a word like Nazi
as a form of abuse
on the second generation.
We are not responsible
for the sins of our parents.
Sin? You actually believe
in sin, Martha?
How very Christian of you.
I mistakenly thought you were
one of those atheists
always arguing with a God you don't
believe in, just in case he's listening.
She does argue a lot, actually.
Mostly with me, though.
Please.
Stop it, all of you.
This is about Bill.
The man who stood by me
through everything,
who gave up
a professorship at Harvard...
- Yale.
- Yale. Yes, of course.
In order to support me
so that I could fulfill
my purpose, and...
Oh, Bill.
I'm-I'm so sorry.
(SOBBING)
Why didn't I notice?
Why didn't I see
that you were ill?
Please, Bill.
Look at me.
Say something.
Don't you think we should
leave them alone for a minute?
What for?
Personal space.
Right now they need us.
They need our attention.
What they need
is our friendship
and some clear thinking.
Burning.
I-I smell burning.
Oh, it's the vol-au-vents.
I'll deal with it.
Isn't Jinny the chef?
A very good one, actually.
Runner-up on MasterChef last year.
Did you watch it?
Two smears of parsnip and a grape coulis.
How could I forget?
So, Jinny, could you?
Ten pounds. You've gained
at least ten pounds, Martha,
since the extremely
touching ceremony.
- Oh. And the matching hats...
- (SCOFFS)
- (COUGHING)
- JANET: Stop being mean to Martha.
APRIL:
All right.
(EXCLAIMS, COUGHING)
MARTHA: Hey, you...
don't just sit there.
- TOM: What can I do?
- Help me.
I can't help anyone.
I can't even help myself.
I am burning.
It's the pastry cases
that are burning, Tom.
Could you turn
the light on, please?
(COUGHS)
Do you think...
Yes, my friend?
Do you really think that
a terminal prognosis
is a-a form of curse?
Yes, I do.
You see, I...
I'm a materialist.
And an atheist.
My worldview
has been formed
on reason
and observation,
cause and effect,
logic and deduction.
I've always been
a rationalist, haven't I?
You have, Bill.
And from a statistical
point of view,
as Janet's
very often reminded me,
it is your...
class background
and economic status
that will determine
your general health
and expected lifespan
infinitely more than
diet or exercise.
That's why health is
a political issue.
We've always agreed about that,
haven't we, Bill?
So words like
"curse" and "voodoo"
have never really featured
in my vocabulary.
But now...
everything looks different.
Perhaps everything
is different.
BILL:
Maybe it is.
But the worst of it
is this:
I'm asking myself
an unanswerable question,
even a metaphysical question.
And what question is that,
my friend?
"Why me?"
When a person becomes sick,
there is always a reason.
If not in this life,
then in a past life.
APRIL:
Oh, Gottfried.
You're an embarrassment.
Possibly, but at least
he's trying to help.
Oh, you're defending
Gottfried now?
April, I too
am frequently described
by Internet trolls as
an embarrassment or worse.
Much worse, actually. Is it a
crime to be an embarrassment?
Martha, you're
a first-class lesbian
and a second-rate thinker.
Must be all those
women's studies.
April, really.
I am a professor
specializing in domestic labor
gender differentiation
in American Utopianism.
My point exactly.
(SMOKE ALARM BEEPING)
JINNY: Oh, shit! (COUGHS)
(BEEPING CONTINUES)
- What do I do?
- I don't know.
Just turn it off or pull
it off or something.
Oh, fuck!
You're really sweaty.
Are you ill too?
I told you, I am burning.
- I have to protect my babies.
- Yes.
You do have
to protect your babies,
like I have to
protect my marriage.
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.
You are very fortunate, Jinny. Myself
and Marianne, we have not had any babies.
Neither has anyone at this
party, as far as I know, but...
So you're definitely
not ill, then?
Tell me who is sick.
Okay? Sick!
Then why aren't you
turning that thing off?
MARTHA: Jinny, are you
doing all right in there?
Yeah, no, I'm fine, thanks.
Tom's helping me, thank you!
(BEEPING CONTINUES)
- (COUGHING)
- (EXCLAIMS)
- (BEEPING STOPS)
- Can I ask you s...
Did I see you out there...
Were...
Were you getting
something out of the...
APRIL: Right.
Let's get to the point.
Listen, Bill,
have they suggested
chopping a few bits out?
Or off?
Because if they have,
I think you should
seriously consider it.
W-What do you say,
Gottfried?
Surgery a good choice
for Bill,
yes or no, from
a life-coach standpoint?
Despite my criticism
of most modern medicine,
I believe surgery
can sometimes be...
healing, April, as you know.
Karmically cleansing.
Yeah, okay. Won't argue, because
Janet doesn't want me to,
but you're full of shit
about karma.
Martha, I need to talk
to you about something,
and I'm starting to feel
really queasy again.
Oh, it's probably
because she's pregnant.
- (DOOR SLAMS)
- Genius.
(VOMITING)
(JIMMY COUGHING)
- (KNOCKS)
- Jinny?
Where's Martha?
She's in there.
She's in there with him.
(COUGHING)
Well, could you tell her
to come here?
I want to say
something to her.
TOM: Wait.
Jinny, no.
You need to tell me
what it is that
you want to say to Martha.
Okay? I need to know
what it is.
Is there something
you have to say about me?
Wait, is there something
that you think you saw?
Maybe.
What do you think
I want to say to her about you?
JINNY: What do you think
I saw?
(SIGHS)
Knowledge, Gottfried,
- Yes.
- is mutable...
and culturally specific.
That's true, but where is this
line of thought heading, chum?
Well, maybe Gottfried
has a point.
What once seemed like medical
science now looks like superstition,
does it not, Martha?
I mean...
And then there's the mystery
of the placebo effect.
The so-called mystery
of the placebo effect
is in fact proof
of the innate ability
of the body
to heal itself.
Wish I didn't agree
with your analysis.
But you do, my darling.
So what have you found,
Gottfried,
with your, um...
healing thing? Uh...
Can, um...
...can f-faith do it?
Faith? You?
Why not?
Bill is growing
extraordinarily fast,
from a spiritual
point of view.
Concerning spirituality,
Bill has debated with
leading rabbis, bishops
and Imams, and he's won.
He's even written
a book about it:
Reason, Roads, and Religion.
Is there a connection, Martha,
between roads and religion?
Bill specialized in Roman
history, as I think you know.
Didn't he supervise
Marianne's PhD?
Yes, he did. He did supervise her PhD.
Yes, her fucking PhD.
And roads link more than cities.
They also link ideas.
Well, thank you, Martha. Thank you for
illuminating me on the question of roads.
Please!
The only one road
that matters now is the road
to Bill's recovery.
- BILL: Do you believe in recovery, Gottfried?
- I do.
Even in a case like mine?
I do.
So you think
I have a future?
As surely
as you had a past.
Isn't this
going too far?
Gottfried may have his good points,
but is not, repeat not, a guru.
Jin?
(TOILET FLUSHES)
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm absolutely not.
Apart from this vomiting,
which is vile,
my least favorite thing, and if it continues,
my pregnancy will be a nightmare...
I'm a little bit concerned
about Tom.
GOTTFRIED:
Listen, my friend.
The truth is very simple.
You just have to listen
to your voice within.
If you seek,
you will find.
Jesus!
Right. And since
we're talking about truth,
Bill, do you think there's
something you might want to add?
I think you know what
I'm talking about, Bill.
You know, truth?
Truth?
Is that a concept that
any of you have heard of?
- Tom. Come on.
- No, Martha. No, please.
- Yes, I do have something to add...
- Yes.
Tom.
What is it, darling?
I'm sorry, Janet.
This is it.
I'm leaving you.
No. We'll beat this
together.
I'll be by your side.
No, Janet. I think he means he's
leaving you in a different sense.
- Tom, come on. Let's just go out...
- No. Martha!
What's going on?
Oh, God. Just...
Bill, just tell her.
What have you to lose, huh?
BILL: Whatever time
I have left, Janet,
which is, uh...
debatable, depending
on your point of view...
I intend to spend...
Together.
We'll be together.
in the company of...
another woman.
(LAUGHS) What on earth
are you talking about?
Another woman?
What other woman?
(EXHALES)
What are you saying
exactly, Bill?
What other woman?
Who?
Who?!
Marianne.
Marianne?
APRIL: The lovely Marianne.
With you, Bill?
- Yes.
- Fuck.
Oh, what am I doing?
I don't do this.
- APRIL: You just did.
- No, no, no. This isn't me.
I shouldn't have hit you.
I shouldn't have hurt you.
I shouldn't have hit you. I'm-I'm sorry.
But I could kill you!
Why!
Just tell me why.
Why now, of all days...
and why... her?
Hmm?
(SOBBING)
Oh, stop me, April. Stop
me from hurting Bill.
- What for?
- Because he's sick. He's dying.
Why don't you tell Janet
how long you've been sleeping
with my wife, Bill?
Or perhaps Martha,
perhaps you would like
to inform Janet,
as I believe
you have on occasion
lent your attractive shabby
chic femme-nest apartment
to your good old pal Bill.
Martha, you knew?
Sounds like she was an
accomplice in this heinous crime.
What a surprise, Professor.
JANET: Marianne and Bill
in your flat, Martha?
Yes.
For how long?
A year.
A year?
What, a fucking year?
Well, two.
- Or so.
- What?
The whole time?
During the campaign,
while I was on the road
when we spoke every night on the phone,
and you kept telling me I could do it?
- You did do it.
- And you were doing it
with Marianne in Martha's
flat while I did it.
Oh!
I thought you were a friend.
I thought you were a sister.
Oh, that dates you, Janet. Sisterhood
is a very ageing concept, sweetheart.
I do consider myself
your friend,
and I really thought about
saying something, but...
But what?
You were...
You were so busy.
Yes, I was busy.
Incredibly busy.
I was working day and night
for the party.
For our party.
Yes, Martha!
I was working for all of us!
Why didn't you
just tell me?
You didn't seem
to want to know
about anything
except politics.
And because I was so dedicated
to saving our country
from profiteering butchery,
you decided to let them
do it in your flat?
Well, I thought better
than in your house,
from-from your
point of view.
Yeah, that's
some kind of friendship.
She was my friend first.
We shared a house
at university together.
(PLACES NEEDLE ON RECORD)
In fact,
we shared everything.
Everything?
Everything?
(SOFT JAZZ PLAYS)
Oh, Jinny.
Did you know too?
Uh, only a little bit.
What, like being
a little bit pregnant?
Martha, don't you think
we should be going?
This is all getting
very physical.
What exactly did you share
with Bill at university?
A house. Digs. Just... That's just...
Don't start!
No. Don't talk
to me like that.
I am a woman with child,
and I am...
- Children. Three.
- Yes, three. Triplets.
- One, two, three.
- I can count. And by the way,
you could've waited till
we got home before you told me.
You should have come to the scan.
You're so unsupportive, Martha.
That is not true. I've been
to nearly every support group.
One.
And there have been three.
- Which makes two...
- I can count, as I just mentioned.
Don't patronize me. And you still
haven't answered my question.
- What else did you share with Bill?!
- Stop this.
So you both knew. Right.
Who else knew?
- April, did you know as well?
- No, I did not.
Although I expect the worst of
everyone, in the name of realism.
I was too preoccupied
with Gottfried's
screamingly obvious faults
to notice this unfolding drama.
Why should
you have noticed?
Janet didn't.
In fact, she hasn't noticed
anything about me for years.
How can you say that?
Because now I know
what it feels like
when somebody does notice.
And likes
what they see!
A lot!
Go on. do it, do it, do it.
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
At least it shows you're
capable of some passion!
- What's happening?
- Revenge.
No. No. No.
No, I don't believe in revenge.
I never have. No.
I've given speeches about it all over
the world. Truth and reconciliation.
I believe I believe
in truth and reconciliation.
(SCREAMING)
(JANET WAILING)
(CRYING)
I believe it's better to hit
a cushion than to eat yourself.
Cushion? She wants to
smash his face in,
not ruin
her soft furnishings.
You need to let
the anger out, Janet.
- It's only natural.
- JINNY: Yes, that's how I feel.
I'd like to let
some anger out too.
What else did you share
with Bill, exactly?
- I already told you.
- No. You never told me about Bill.
He was my best friend at
university. You know that.
What kind of best friend?
Did you sleep together?
BILL: Once.
Or twice.
It was a mistake.
I think we agreed, though,
at the time, didn't we, Martha?
- It was fun, though.
- No.
JINNY: Oh, so you have had
a man inside you after all.
And it was fun.
That is so disgusting.
I'm disgusted.
APRIL: It sounds like you might
have three little men inside you.
(CHUCKLING)
(HELICOPTER HOVERS OVERHEAD)
(SIGHS)
(REGGAE MUSIC PLAYS)
It's good.
It's good that
this is all coming out.
Very good.
But now I think, uh,
you need to
protect yourself
from so much
negative female energy.
Gottfried,
you are surpassing yourself.
How?
How do I do that?
I'll help you.
I seem to remember,
Bill,
that you called yourself
a feminist in the old days.
Everything's changed.
Change is good.
Why is change good?
Tom.
Come. Sit.
Try to relax a little.
(EXHALES)
(PHONE RINGS)
Yes. Oh, it's very kind
of you to call.
Yes, just a little
celebration.
- Well, yes.
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
It has been
quite a journey.
Mm. Well, yes, looking forward to it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
(SOBBING)
Janet.
It's me. Come on.
Let me in.
Darling...
Listen to me.
One of the reasons
I have never believed
in parliamentary politics
is that the procedures
are so slow.
So bureaucratic. You can't always
vote your way out of conflict.
APRIL: Direct action,
swift, decisive moves...
that's what gets things done.
Remember when I used to be
an idealist like you?
All those marches...
we went on together,
thinking someone
in power would listen.
Well, now I'm a realist.
And I do believe,
under the circumstances,
that although it might have
a deleterious effect
on your career strategy,
you could consider murder.
(SOBS)
I just can't believe
that you slept with that...
hairy old man, that...
disgusting,
randy old rapist!
It was over 30 years ago.
It was...
It was nearly 40 years ago,
and you were still
in kindergarten.
And you know what? He is not
particularly hairy, as a matter of fact.
And furthermore,
not all men are rapists.
I really think that we have
moved beyond that position.
What position? What are
you talking about, Martha?
Men are not the enemy. That debate is over.
It is finished.
(TOM ROARING)
(GLASS SHATTERS)
Tom, my friend. Tom.
Now that you've
expressed your feelings,
let's put a stop
to all this violence
and talk together as men.
Huh? The three of us.
This is a crisis
that can become a moment
of deep personal
transformation.
But I don't want
to transform.
I just want
my wife back.
I just want...
Gottfried, I just want things
to be the way they were before.
Why do you people always
want everything to change?
Everything is changing
whether you want it or not.
We cannot fight impermanence.
I'm not fighting
fucking impermanence!
I'm fighting for
the love of my life!
For life!
So am I.
Life. Life!
This is good.
You share an impulse.
No, I do not share anything
with him, especially not...
Tom, I think someone
in your profession
is perhaps not familiar
with losing.
I never lose.
Gottfried, I do not lose.
I... I am a winner.
Do you understand? I am a...
I'm a winner.
And I also think
you are in shock.
Yes. Yes.
Tom...
when exactly
did you discover...
Today.
I found out today.
She told you at last.
Oh, Marianne, I...
I knew you would.
She did not tell me.
I read your texts,
and I read your...
your fucking emails.
Look at this. Wait.
"Let us live
and let us love."
Catullus.
"Let us too
give in to love."
Virgil.
"You who seek an end
to love... love...
"You who seek
an end to love,
love will yield to business."
What the fuck is that?
She wants love and ideas,
you see, Tom?
Not money and business.
Such a...
Such an intelligent,
such a sensitive woman,
such a... passionate woman.
Brothers,
you have something
beautiful in common.
We have nothing in common.
GOTTFRIED:
Yeah, you-you do.
You both love Marianne.
And love is
a very powerful force.
Gottfried, you do realize
that Tom is one of those
amoral money men,
strutting about
in his City suit.
Here we go.
Oh, you fucking
English intellectuals,
you think you're
so superior, huh?
Even you
need money, Bill!
Money bought this house,
not fucking ideas!
Not with your dirty money!
No money is clean, Bill.
It all comes through the
system and into your pocket!
Into your
grubby little pocket!
That's real money.
Cash, Tom.
You trade
in fictional profits
stolen from workers'
hard-earned pension funds!
Stolen?
From the mouth of the man
that stole my wife!
You stole my wife!
She chose me.
She did not choose you.
She did not choose you.
- Not you.
- But she did.
She chose me.
We're in love.
(SOBBING)
No.
I'm finished, April.
Nonsense.
Listen.
I realize I risk sounding
uncannily like Gottfried,
but I believe what you are
experiencing is a feeling.
It's a horrible feeling.
I can see it's unpleasant.
But like all feelings,
it will surely pass.
And then what?
Oh, fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Is he alive?
Gottfried, is he alive?
Shit!
God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Gottfried, what do I do?
What do I do?
- Just wait and see.
- Okay.
- Gottfried... (EXCLAIMS)
- (CHOKING GASP)
- He is alive.
- (GURGLING)
I'll put on some music.
He likes music.
I'll put on some music.
(ELEGIAC BAROQUE MUSIC PLAYS)
(CHOKING GASPS)
(SNIFFLES)
I adore you, Janet.
But if you really want
to run this country,
and we both know that you do...
actually, you must,
for all our sakes...
you will have to do
something about your hair.
Did they tell you
that they were boys?
No, we agreed.
We agreed not to know.
I know, but...
but did you...
did you see on the screen
their little legs
and toes and things?
No, I didn't want to look,
and I felt sick.
But three boys...
Almost a...
a football team.
Don't you want them?
Have you changed
your mind?
Bill! Bill!
Tom, this might be
the wrong piece of music.
Okay.
(NEEDLE SCRATCHES RECORD)
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYS)
Oh, my God.
(CHOKING GASPS,
GURGLING)
I'm so sorry.
It's going to be okay.
Bill...
Come on, Bill.
It's all right, Bill.
Bill.
It's gonna be okay, huh?
Gottfried?
- April.
- Janet.
We've known each other
a long time.
I want you to be
truthful with me.
Have I ever been
anything else?
Well, you disguise yourself
as a cynic, so...
Everyone's in disguise,
including you...
all that fake
political certainty.
It's not fake.
It's just, sometimes you have
to pretend in order to win.
Well, it hasn't worked
for your party for a while
and it won't work
for you.
You're lost,
aren't you, Janet?
Incredibly competent...
but lost.
(SHUDDERY BREATHING)
I have to think.
Don't think.
It might ruin everything.
It usually does.
Well, someone has to
do the thinking,
especially now that you're...
you're taking care of
the animal side of things.
Animal.
Is that what you think
I've become? A...
A few more hormones
flying round my body to support new
life, and suddenly I'm an animal?
- (GYPSY JAZZ PLAYS)
- This? Gottfried?
Martha, after this evening, I never want to see
you again. I'm going to do this on my own.
Don't be ridiculous.
I-I would rather give
birth alone than with you.
If this is what you
really think of me, I...
After ev...
After everything you said.
Have you forgotten
our beautiful vows, Martha?
(LAUGHS SADLY,
SNIFFLES)
It's over, isn't it?
We're through.
I'm just afraid, Jinny.
That's all. I'm just...
I'm just afraid.
(SIGHS)
I'm afraid of losing
everything that we had.
And I'm... I'm afraid
of losing each other.
And I'm...
I'm afraid of...
of losing you
to our sons.
TOM: Come on. Come on!
Bill!
Come on!
Come on, Bill!
Oh, this is not
a very good situation.
Please don't leave me.
I love you more
than life itself.
Martha, could you
come here for a moment?
I think possibly
there is a problem.
Bill! Bill!
(SOBS)
(SIGHS)
Tell me, April...
truthfully.
Anything.
Have I wasted my life
on a mirage?
No.
You're the only one of us
who's tried to do something
really big.
Hmm.
But in the process, is it
possible that I may have...
(SIGHS) contributed in some
way to Bill getting sick?
I mean...
have I been
emotionally neglectful?
That's not a productive
line of thought.
Because...
um...
well, April, I do have
something to tell you.
I was wondering about that.
(EXCLAIMS, VOMITING)
APRIL: Oh! Oh, dear!
MARTHA: April, could you
come out here for a moment?
But perhaps without Janet?
(BLOWING AIR)
(BILL GURGLES)
- (GOTTFRIED EXHALES)
- Bill! Bill! Bill!
(PANTS)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- (BILL GASPS)
- (EXCLAIMS)
(BILL BREATHING RAGGEDLY)
Janet...
How has it...
come to this?
APRIL: You know, Gottfried,
our relationship is starting
to look remarkably healthy.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
(GASPS)
Marianne.
Janet, please don't kill me!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Please don't kill me! I'm a good person!
I'm a good person!
You told me you loved me.
Me!
You traitor!
