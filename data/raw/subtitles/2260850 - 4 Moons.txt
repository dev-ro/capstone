So, did you like the movie?
- So so.
- I did liked it.
- You don't know, you didn't even see it.
- Of course I did.
You went outside for half an
hour to be on the phone.
There was something urgent from
the office I had to take care of.
I just don't get it. why do we come to the movies
if you never get to see the whole thing.
What should I do then? Stop talking
phone calls even though it's urgent?
Let's just stop talking.
You have a Playstation, don't you?
Yes, If you want we can play
Street Fighter when we get home.
- Do you have the new one?
- Yeah.
Are you always the last
one to get picked up?
No, I do not know why they're late
today. Sometimes I walk home.
What Street Fighter character
do you pick to play?
- Honda.
- Nobody picks Honda.
- Which one do you pick?
- Chun Li.
- That's gay. It's a girl, dude.
- So what?
She's fast.
- Hi.
- Hi...
It is you, right?
I'm Adolfo, and you?
You cocky Fito. I'm Leo
from Tepic, dude.
- How are you?
- How are you?
4 MOONS
So you guys knew each other?
Yes since we were kids. We lived
two blocks away from each other.
And I just ran into him.
- So, you're from Tepic too?
- Yeah.
Another one? Dammit, these
tepiqueans are invading us.
We're not called tepiqueans, fucker.
Don't listen to him,
he's always like this.
You always want to find other people from
Nayarit so you won't be the only weird one.
Shut up, dude.
This is a big deal. He was my best friend
when we were eight years old.
- We used to hang out every day.
- Yeah, we went to school together.
And so? You got into a fight
with eachother or what?
No, but my dad got a job here. And we said
We were going to stay in touch but...
Yeah, that usually happens...
You meet cooler friends and
then you forget old ones.
Hey ...
- This is not the cool one.
- Why not?
This is the regular one.
There is a "super" version now that came
out and it has six new characters.
I didn't know that.
- But you still want to play, right?
- Yes.
Kids, lunch will be
ready in ten minutes,
so you guys come on
down then, okay?
Yes tell me...
Very good.
I will tell the teacher and
we'll call you back.
Have a nice day and
thank you very much.
- Who was that?
- From the Santa Catarina University.
They want to hold a ceremony,
to pay homenage to you.
Which one is that?
My dear, I don't know. But it's a
homenage, just for you.
And they want to read
some of your poems.
No, no...
- No.
- Yes. It would be so nice.
I'm going to fix up your suit,
you'll look so handsome.
Hi...
Do you change?
- How much?
- 1500 pesos.
- Why so much?
- That's the price.
And no, it's not for anyone.
Don't you talk to me like that.
You're not even that hot,
fucking stupid.
Fucking poor.
Isn't that one that
tasted funny last time?
No, it was good.
Remember it's for everyone,
not just for you.
You know Andrés? It's so annoying that
everything I choose is wrong for you.
- What did you pick?
- I can't think of anything.
Really, it's not necessary.
Come on, Fito, we're going
in the same direction.
Okay, but drop me off
somewhere in your route.
Nah, right to your doorsep,
like a pizza.
Well, more like a cold pizza, we're not
gonna make it in less than half an hour.
So I'll have chance to say hello to your
parents. Let's see if they remember me.
My dad died.
I'm so sorry.
- Hi Mom.
- Hi.
- How was your day?
- Fine.
Guess whom I ran into
at school today.
No way, I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't want to think about that.
I just don't.
Look, we're not going to be this
young and beautiful forever.
Well, by young I wasn't
meaning Danny.
For starters, we need to make a selection
of the people that will be there, right?
Something like a casting.
No trashy people.
And there has to be a creek.
Yes, yes.
Tell me something, does this retirement
community have a name?
Yes, I have one, I hope you like it...
- WonderVille.
- Yes, I love it, I love it.
Because the houses in the village have
to be super luxurious, super fancy...
You moron, are you doing the
cleaning everyday or what?
No, you're the the moron. I'm
not doing any cleaning.
We should have waiters to
bring food to the houses.
Or how about a sushi-go-round?
That's a good idea, that way the
sushi can go through each houses.
and you try it, if you don't like it,
you can just let it go through.
You spit it out and on to
the next house. Gross!
And drinking fountains!
Not with water...
but with wine or scoth, right?
Or with fondues. Drinking
fountains of foundues!
- Yes of course. Chocolate fondue.
- No, not chocolate.
I mean cheese fondues.
Not too hot so we don't
burn our tongues.
I'd also like to have a movie theater in my
house. You know I love movies, right?
And also to have a huge staircase
where I could place a picture...
for every year Hugo and I
have been together.
How long have you
guys been together?
- Almost eight years now.
- Ten...
Ten?
Well, and we'll need a nurse to
give this sir his memory drugs.
Oh yes, drugs!
Another kind of drugs for the rest of us.
How do you like that?
Yes, drugs, drugs!
Cheers. To the community.
To the oldness.
Are you sure you're
okay in this one?
I can sleep in this one and you
can take my bed if you want.
No, this one's fine, thanks.
There's barely any room left.
I'll have to buy a bigger fridge.
They're so much. You have such a
huge collection. Congratulations.
Thanks.
It's been a long time
collecting them.
You know what? I have some very
nice frigde magnets at home.
- I'll bring them to you.
- Really? Thank you so much.
And thanks for coming.
Hey, baby.
- I'm kind a drunk.
- Yes, I can see that.
I laughed a lot.
I hadn't laughed like
that in a long time.
- They were laughing a lot too.
- Yes, they were laughing a lot. At you.
No, with me.
- Is that what you think?
- Come on, baby.
Hey, baby...
- I want you to do things to me.
- I don't feel like it.
Baby, do me.
Do things to me.
- Don't you want some of this?
- Andrés I'm tired.
Do you remember what we've
talked about your mannerisms?
- What?
- That I like manly guys.
I don't know if you realize it, but when we're
with our friends you act too feminine...
and I don't like it.
I see they all notice it.
I think you could take
it down a notch.
Oh, it bothered you.
Fine then, if you prefer,
I'll say no more.
You go out and keep
being the funny queer.
I'm just saying I don't feel like having
sex with someone like that.
And I didn't want to say this but it's very
embarassing how keep the fridge.
It's too faggy.
The house has great sense of style
to have something like that ruin it.
Héctor, breakfast is ready.
Sit down, I'll fix it for your.
No, I'm late. Isaac
is picking me up.
- Bye, son.
- Bye.
Be good, okay?
You guys are late too. Hurry up.
Are you done?
- Yes.
- Almost.
Oliver, go get your stuff.
Mau pick up your plate when you're
done. I'll go take the car out.
What are you doing?
Are you done?
Yes, I was just...
Hey wait. Here's
your backpack!
Well, you fucking drunks,
I'm outta here.
- Does anybody want a ride?
- I do, "Furry".
Fito...
Do you want a ride?
No thanks. It's a ten
minute walk to my house.
- Damn it!
- What?
Fuck! I forgot the damn keys
and there's no one home...
they all went to Cuernavaca.
- Really?
- Yes.
- You can stay at my place.
- Really?
Sure, no problem.
There's enough room.
Alright, cool, we're
all set up then.
Take care. See you.
Damn. You were like this
when I met you.
- It's funny, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Now I'm all emotional.
- Moron.
Well, I'll leave you now.
- Make yourself at home.
- What about you?
I'll sleep on the couch,
in the living room.
Come on dude. Stay here for a
while, so we can catch up.
Weren't you sleepy?
Well, yes but not
anymore. And you?
I wasn't sleepy at all.
- Do you want to borrow a T-shirt?
- Yes, please.
Wait.
Why did you come
to Mexico City?
- When my dad died...
- No, sorry. I didn't mean to...
My dad has been sick
for several months.
With medication and the hospital
there were lots of bills to pay.
When he died, my mom didn't
have a job or any money.
She couldn't find a job there...
so my aunt who lives
here, got a job for her.
Fito, seriously, if it's painful you
don't have to tell me anything.
I got the scholarship for college.
I've been telling my mom that I'm gonna
hurry up and finish so I can help her.
She tells me it's all fine
but I know it's not.
Things are pretty bad.
And my dad death...
still hurts a lot for both of us.
I'm sorry...
I shouldn't have asked.
I'm such an idiot.
When my dad died I didn't
have any friends...
nothing...
Dummy, you should've called me.
It would've helped me a lot.
It's alright. Don't cry...
I didn't mean to get like this.
Don't be silly.
I'm fine. Are you comfortable?
Or am I holding you too tight?
I'm fine. I'm really comfortable.
I'm fine too.
Very comfortable.
Sleep now...
Did you sleep well?
Didn't crush you
or bothered you?
You have such nice skin.
Seriously.
It looks super smooth.
I even feel like kissing your cheek.
What?
You tickled me.
I can tickle your lips?
Are you gay?
I don't know.
But you liked it, didn't you?
Kissing.
Yes, a lot.
And you?
- Are you gay?
- No.
But you liked it...
Don't you think your
mom may have noticed?
Not at all. She
sleeps in on Sundays.
Okay, see you, then.
- Good to see you.
- Listen, I want a favor...
I don't want anyone to
know what happened.
I won't tell anybody.
Fine, dude. See you.
I want to buy the new
"Street Fighter" game.
- That's the one we just bought, isn't it?
- No.
I have the old one. There's a better one
now and it has six new characters.
But isn't it the one you wanted?
The one you were asking for?
Yes but I didn't know there
was another one coming...
and it's a special edition.
Those things are very expensive, son.
I can't right now.
- But mom, I really want it.
- What's your problem?
Don't you get it?
I don't like it when you
throw a tantrum. I said no.
Stop bothering me.
But I get good grades ...
Why dont you sell the one you already
have and save the rest of the money?
How am I supposed to save money? And
besides, who's gonna buy the old one?
Well, if you help me out with some
chores in the house, I could...
Not in the house...
There is the utility room.
It needs to be tidied up.
You can help with that.
How much?
I don't have a lot.
- Two thousand.
- How come?
Yesterday you said
fifteen hundred pesos.
Yesterday it was fifteen hundred.
Don't be a jerk.
- Is he coming?
- Yes, yes...
Do you like it, fucker?
What's going on?
I've met someone.
I wanted to tell you but
I didn't know how.
What are you saying?
It is not just sex, is it?
What is it then?
Hugo...
Look at me in the eye.
Hugo, look at me.
Hugo...
I love you.
And I love you very much.
I know.
And I'd like to know
what to do, but I don't.
Just tell me one thing...
Tell me you won't go,
tell me you're not leaving me.
Tell me you're not
going to leave me...
that you'll stay here with me.
I can't.
I wish I knew what to do.
I do know.
You're confused, Hugo.
This is just a matter of time.
I want you to do me a favor.
Give me a chance.
I don't know if that's
going to fix this.
I just need you to stop seeing him...
and to stop talking to him,
for two weeks.
- Please.
- I can't.
Please.
Please, please...
What if nothing changes
in two weeks?
Then I leave.
Just like that.
No complains, nothing.
Yes?
Hi.
Hi.
Look what I made for you.
What is it?
It's a board.
Something like a schedule,
I made for you.
Everyday of the week we'll
do an activity you like.
Today, for example,
I'll give you a massage.
You always say I don't want to give you
massages. Well, I'm giving you one today.
Tomorrow night
a special dinner.
And that's how it works.
What do you think?
It's fine.
"What bookworm!"
- Hey, what's up?
- How are you?
- Ready to go?
- Yes.
- Do you want some?
- No thanks.
I do not like mushrooms.
Do you want some salad?
No I don't eat olives,
but thanks.
So, what kind of music
do you like?
Electronic. You?
You'll say I'm such a nerd.
I like pretty much anything. Nothing too
trashy, though, like reggaeton.
I can't stand it anymore.
But my favorite music are pop
ballads from the 50's and 60's.
- Also latin rock. That's it.
- Cool.
Books?
What books do you like?
I love reading Oscar Wilde...
but my very favorite book since
I was a child is "The Little Prince".
- Have you read it?
- Yes.
I love it.
Hail Mary.
Full of grace.
Tell me your sins.
Tell me...
I believe I am a bad person,
because I do bad things ...
And I thinking of ugly things that
are going to hurt Jesus a lot.
Is it a sin to be a homossexual?
Don't you worry.
It's not a sin?
I mean, it does constitutes
a sin, and a very grave one.
But you have nothing
to worry about.
You're not a homossexual, Mauricio.
How could you be a homossexual?
... Cry no more,
that from now on,
I will never...
... make you cry.
Sleep and don't cry.
my sweet Jesus.
Sleep and don't cry.
My sweet love.
My girlfriend brought strange.
- What do you mean?
- We were making out, the usual stuff...
"Draw me a sheep ..."
"In the very moment when you
read this, whenever that is....
you can be sure
I'm thinking of you".
I made your favorite.
To us.
How are you feeling today?
How am I doing?
How are we doing?
Fine.
May I?
Otherwise he won't stop calling.
Don't take long or it will get cold.
Do you want to?
Yes. Do you?
- But who does what?
- I'm doing you.
What if it hurts?
I better do you.
Fine.
Alright, if you want,
you can do me.
No?
Lower or what?
I think you need to be higher.
Try with the pillow.
Hold on, lift it up.
there, like that.
- There it is.
- Okay.
What?
- Easy, dude!
- I think it's not slipping in.
- Got any lube?
- No...
Some vaseline...
or cream?
- Be careful, please.
- Yes.
Wait.
- I think it's going in this time.
- Damn ...
It feels so good, but I don't
know if I'm hurting you.
It does hurt but I kind
a like it too.
Wait ...
- Try again.
- Wait, I'm going soft.
Fuck, it's so complicated.
Okay, there it goes...
- I like this very much.
- Me too.
- You're not liking it at all, are you?
- No.
But keep going.
I might get used to it.
Do you rather want me to
pull it out and jerk off?
Take it out and I'll kick
your ass, motherfucker.
Hey...
I want to tell you something,
but I'm a bit afraid.
Tell me...
I don't bite... I just fuck.
And really good.
I don't want you to
freak out, okay?
Oh, boy! What are you
gonna tell me?
That I'm falling in love with you.
Dude...
I thought you were going to
tell me something harsh...
like  "I don't like you anymore"
or something like that.
You're such a moron.
Not you're the moron.
You know what?
I'm falling in love with you too.
So, I'll bring the salt cod, mom...
but ask Marianna to
pick up the turkey.
Yes please, because
it's hard for me now.
Yes I'll go.
But the spaghetti
I'm making it for sure.
So we agreed we're having
secret Santa, right?
Yes.
Fine, but you'll give something
to your grandkids, right?
Just to little ones. We're going to
give money to the older ones.
Because, as I said told your dad, they
don't really like what they get.
Yes, mom. don't worry.
Some cash is fine.
Yes, some money is perfect.
Hey Dad, why are you so quiet?
Dad, why so quiet?
It's still a long time before
Christmas. Too long.
No wait. That's not what
your dad is excited about...
He's excited about
something else. Tell them.
What? What is it?
There's going to be a ceremony
to pay homage to him.
Oh, Dad!
Wow! They had taken
too long, though.
I bet they'll soon have more
ceremonies for you.
From your lips to God's ears.
And while he's still alive,
which is what matters.
Mom!
What's the point of doing it
afterwards, when they're dead?
- Mom!
- Don't you start crying.
Mom, where is
this happening?
At some University...
The University of... What?
- I wrote it down somewhere.
- Santa Catarina!
- Yes that's the one.
- Yes.
It is a very good college.
Very prestigious, right?
- Sounds very good.
- Yes.
We'll be there with you, dad.
Count us in.
Hey ...
Just asking...
Are you guys a couple?
- What is that, fucker?
- Nothing, just saying...
I think it is pretty cool
when there is love.
When there's fear it's not so cool.
But if you guys are gay, that's great.
- I 'm cool with...
- No, asshole.
Cut the crap.
Alright. No, then.
All I'm saying is why the
hell does he care?
I'm not saying anything.
- Listen, this isn't about you.
- I'm not saying it is.
What is it Fito?
It just doesn't feel nice that when a friend
or ours notices and talks about it...
you get like this.
You and I talked about this already
I don't want anyone to know.
I know, Leo, that's why
I'm not complaining.
Do you really want
everyone to know?
So everywhere you go people will point
at you saying: "there goes the fag"?
- I don't know anymore.
- What do you mean?
I just do not know.
A lot has happened in the
last two weeks, Leo.
- I'm starting to see things differently.
- Anyway you put it...
Fine.
Mom?
Could you turn down the volume
during the commercials?
What for, son?
I want to tell you something.
Mom.
Commercials...
I've been thinking a lot.
and with everything that has
happened, my dad and all that...
Well, I don't like that there's stuff
I can talk to you about.
I'm really scared about telling
you what I have to say...
Adolfo, please, don't.
What do you mean? What is it?
That what you have to tell me...
I beg you not to.
I don't understand.
Your dad is gone.
and there are certain things...
I can't handle by myself.
Things I don't like.
What should I do then?
Keep them for yourself...
and let me out of all that.
It's starting now.
I am here.
And I do want something
serious with you.
So do I, Sebastián.
But people are not like tissues which you
get to use and throw away just like that.
- Don't give me that bullshit.
- I've been with him for ten years now.
And how many of those
have been wort it?
But he asked me to give him time and
he's always been loyal with me.
I owe it to him.
You let me fall for you.
- Yes, I know. I'm an asshole.
- You didn't tell me you were with someone.
Alright, take your time.
But you know what? I'm a hot
guy and people come to me.
No, asshole. I'm just asking
you to give some time.
You are the asshole.
You can be with him...
and I have to be here, waiting
for you, like I'm your whore.
I'm sorry.
Sebastián was upset that I
hadn't called him and...
- We had an agreement.
- I know, I know...
It won't happen again.
Promise?
I promise.
Come to bed, here with me...
But take a shower first, you stink.
I've got the money.
I could only get fifteen
hundred pesos.
No, I told you two thousand.
- That's all I have.
- Then no.
You really have no idea.
You treat me like garbage...
But you don't know me.
I'm an important person.
People even hold ceremonies
to pay homage to me.
Don't be a jerk.
I got fifteen hundred.
But we'll do it my way.
Yes.
Let's go to the locker room
and I'll give it to you.
- But it will happen tomorrow.
- Why?
I just gave service. I can't do it
twice in a row. It hurts.
- I'll pay you tomorrow then.
- Look, man...
If you don't pay me today, I can't
warranty anything for tomorrow...
if somebody else comes before you.
Alright, then.
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.
- My aunts are over there.
- So what?
If they see me here, what
am I supposed to say?
That you came to see a show.
- Yes, a show for gays.
- Of course not, don't be silly.
What if they tell my mom that
they saw me here, with you?
They are here. What are they?
Lesbians?
- I feel really uncomfortable.
- Just because they're over there.
Maybe for you this is dumb,
but it really frightens me.
- Well, what should we do then?
- Let's go.
But it hasn't even started yet.
This was supposed to be our celebration.
Besides it took me a lot to save for the tickets.
Are you seriously going
to mention the money?
You're not in a gay bar, it's a theater.
I don't want my family to suspect
anything, not even the tiniest clue.
And what's the point of staying
if I'm not going to enjoy it.
I'm uncomfortable.
Mom, did I do well?
You did very well.
Your aunt and uncle are here, Mau.
Would you open the door, please?
- Hi, Mauricio, how are you?
- Hi, uncle.
- Hello.
- How are you doing, boy?
- Hey, cousin!
- What's up?
I have something to show you.
I almost thought we were
gonna wait until breakfast.
What's up, boy?
My friend, what's up?
This is now how I imagined
this night would be.
My parents have worked really
hard to give me everything.
- And I will not upset then like this.
- Upset them...
I'm not ashamed about this.
I'm proud of being with you.
- I even told my mom already.
- What?
What did you tell her?
Why the fuck it is so hard for you to
understand that I don't want anyone to know.
I can't go back to your house now.
I hope your aunts don't come out right now so they
don't see the little gay husband scene you're making.
God dammit, motherfucker.
Stop pushing me.
I love you but I am not
going to hurt my family.
I'm sorry, but I just won't.
How much was it? A thousand
for both, right?
Here.
So you're going to Quebec?
Yes, to spend Christmas with my mom...
and we're staying for
a few more days.
So you're spending New Year's Eve there?
Yes, we'll stay there for some
days, then we'll come back.
How nice.
-It's going to be pretty cold, right?
- That's true...
But with some wine we can
keep ourselves warm.
I've been asking and...
by Christmas, we'll be at least fifteen
or twenty degrees below zero.
No kidding!
- Guess what?
- What?
- Look! I got it.
- It's cool.
Do you want to play?
- No! How do you do it, dude?
- Pratice.
- This one is cool.
- Yes.
- You can borrow it if you want.
- No, I rather buy it later.
To be honest, I don't
play much. Take it.
But I don't know when
I could give it back to you.
It's fine. That way you'll get to pratice.
so you can beat me next time.
So, how's school?
Fine, I guess.
Hey...
Can I ask you something?
Do you know what
circuncision is?
- Are you circumcised?
- Yes.
I'm not.
So? Re-match?
Have you seen an
uncircumcised one?
Yes, at the club. In the showers.
I've never seen a
circumcised one.
Come on, let's play.
Hey...
Would you show it to me?
What for? Don't be a fag.
Just saying...
If I show mine,
you show me your?
Alright, then.
There.
Your turn.
Lock the door.
It's locked.
There it is.
Well, it looks prettier that way.
It's the same.
Hey...
Can I touch it?
Don't be a fag.
Look how it got.
You're such a fucking faggot.
If you want to do military service
before your time, you can.
That's what I did
- So, that's what they call "advanced".
- I did it at seventeen instead of eighteen.
That's advanced.
They call for your generation,
people born the same year as you.
But when he was told "turn left"...
- ...he went to the right.
- Of course.
"Of course", he say proudly.
But I wasn't the only one,
I felt protected.
I said very ugly things...
I was rude.
I freaked out and I didn't
know how to react.
Can you forgive me?
Well, yes.
My parents would prefer
me to be anything but a fag.
I get really scared.
We all get scared.
I've got an idea. Every year
my family throws a party...
lots of people come.
Would you like to come?
Are you awake?
Are you feeling alright?
Yes, why?
You've been restless all night.
I don't feel sleepy, that's all.
You've haven't been taking your medication,
you always forget about it.
It's because you're nervous, right?
is it about the homage?
Don't be silly, woman.
Sleep already, sleep.
Sweetie, do you love me?
You say such nice things to me.
Hi, Mau. How was your day?
Is the tie fine?
What a fancy party.
No, it won't work.
This one was your dad's
He was very good at choosing ties.
What time are they picking you up?
At 7.
It's already, isn't it?
It's 7:20, but I'm sure
they'll be here soon.
I'm not going out...
why don't you take the car
so you don't have to wait?
No.
They'll be here soon.
I've been waiting for you
for over two hours.
What took you so long?
I'm here now. Do we get
a room or what?
- Yes, let's go.
- Let's go.
I liked it very much.
Next time, it's gonna
be two thousand.
And hurry up, I'll be gone soon.
I don't think I can get it.
You had it this time.
Yes...
but I paid you with the
money for my gandkids...
or their Christmas gifts.
What about you?
Where will you go?
I'm saving money to
get across the border.
My wife and my baby stayed there.
How come? Then...
You don't like men?
No.
- I think I should go now.
- No, no...
I need a favor.
I write, poetry.
And they're having a ceremony
to pay homenage to me.
The first one...
And the last.
Why?
I'm sick, everything in my
body is shutting down.
What I want ask you is how much
would you change me to attend?
A thousand pesos.
Fine.
Then you go and, when it's finished...
I'll pay you.
No one can suspect a thing.
My wife and everyone
is going to be there.
And they can't know.
Alright, my friend. I get it.
Dear, It's almost 9.
Why don't you call then again?
Hello?
What's up? Yes, yes...
So, you're downstairs already?
Okay, I'll be right out. See you.
Mom, they're downstairs already.
I'm leaving now.
- Have fun.
- Bye. Thanks.
"I'm sorry".
Easy...
You're way too good for this.
If he isn't the one...
There's going to be someone else
who will appreciate you, son.
I will support you.
And I will accept
whomever you love.
But make sure he
loves you back.
Because who doesn't love
you, doesn't deserve you.
Remember that.
This feels nice, doesn't it?
You, holding me tight.
I told you it was just
a matter of time.
I love you, kiddo.
I love you.
I love you too, so much...
I love it when you call me "kiddo".
I want you to make love to me.
As soon as we get home.
Hang on, let me brush my teeth.
Is everything alright?
Yes, everything's fine.
I just got a message from Sebastián
telling me something urgent came up.
Give me five minutes to
see what happened.
I just wanted to tell you
I'm with someone.
Why are you telling me this?
I thought it was fair to
let you know first.
You said you were going
to wait for me.
Come on, man, don't be an ass.
We agreed on something.
Go fuck yourself, you fucking
faggot, piece of shit!
I gotta go.
Don't you fuck him,
son of a bitch. Don't...
I'm fine, Andrés...
- Calm down, please...
- I'm fine, Andrés...
Andrés, leave me alone! I'm fine...
Leave me alone!
- Fuck!
- Calm down!
Calm down already!
Calm down... Calm down...
Easy now, please...
He's a son of a bitch.
There... There...
Easy, please... Easy...
Calm down...
- Forgive me.
- Easy, Don't say anything...
I didn't know you had an
agreement with him to wait for you.
It was just an expression,
Andrés. I was really pissed...
I'm going to take care of you...
I'm going to take a very
good care of you...
This is my home, isn't it?
This one right here, with you...
This is your home... I am your home.
I don't know how you can
love someone so stupid...
That's what I'm afraid of, Hugo...
That some day, just like
that, I'll run out of love...
That I won't know how
to love you anymore.
- Hey! How're you doing, dude?
- What's up?
- What's up?
- Not much, just hangin'...
What are you doing here? I thought
I was the only one who had to come.
No, me too.
Everyone else is on
vacation already...
Hey, have you seen Fito?
I think he's mad at me and I haven't
heard from him in a while...
I haven't seen him in a while...
Do you want some?
No.
I remember now, I just saw him...
- He's gay...
- Fito?
- What?
- He told us...
- He didn't tell you?
- No...
That's weird.
Yes, he came out of
the closet for good.
He goes to gay places now
and has new friends...
He's going out with a guy already.
It sucks, you know? Because I think
you guys made such a nice couple...
Oh, no, but you're not gay...
I was kidding, sorry.
No, you're straight, dude.
- Everything alright?
- Yes, yes...
- This one's cool, isn't it?
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I like it.
- No. I mean, who was that?
- Nobody.
- Sure?
Really, it was nobody.
"Exclusive intimate party (Men only)"
- What's wrong, Fito?
- Nothing...
You're not getting it because you
missed the soap opera yesterday.
And it will end this week.
What happened yesterday?
That dumb Rosita is
marrying Ricky...
But she doesn't love him.
How do you know?
because it's obvious,
you can tell...
She's still in love with Lalo...
That's why I don't like her...
She's very pretty but
sometimes she's really dumb.
And what's with that Ricky anyway?
She's with him just because
she doesn't want to be alone...
Poor thing...
But you'll see they're
getting back together.
And they better. I've been
here just for them...
those Lalo and Rosa...
They better end up together.
Morons...
Why do you go to the
men's restroom?
You should do to the
woman's, or fag's...
You went to the men's restroom to see if
you could grab it to someone, right?
Do you wanna grab it to me or
you rather jerk one them off?
I'm talking to you faggot.
You hear me, fag?
Leave me alone...
- Leave me alone!
- Leave me alone, you said?
Let go me. Leave me!
Fucking faggot!
Oliver, did you hit him?
Yes.
But ask him why.
Why?
Why, son?
Because he's a fag...
He's a faggot, that's
why we hit him.
Why do you accuse him?
Why are you saying that?
Ask him. He knows why...
Mauricio, why is
Oliver saying that?
Tell them...
Tell them what you did to me
that day in your house.
Mauricio?
- I think we should end this now, shouldn't we?
- Yes, please. Can we...?
Mauricio!
He grabbed me, down there...
Tell then how you grabbed it,
all the stuff you were doing to me...
But he wanted it too...
Dad, he wanted it too...
Oliver, let's go.
- I already have the tickets for the play.
- That's good. Where do we meet?
If you want I can meet you there, because
I'm pretty close from the theater.
- Should we meet around 8?
- Sounds perfect.
- Okay, kisses.
- Bye.
It's an honor for us
to pay this homage,
humble yet very honest
to Professor Cobo,
- whom we admire and respect greatly.
- Thanks.
Here, at the University of Santa Catarina...
we believe he hasn't been given
the place he deserves...
amongst the greatest mexican authors.
That's why we're having this
ceremony in his honor...
so we can give recognition to
his work in our humble abode.
It makes me very proud...
to be able to read some of
his best-known poems,
like "Northen lights",
"The Caterpillar"...
" In Paradise"...
Oh, and a new one...
he wants to share with us tonight.
I have it here.
"Fly within, golden feathers that
follow the sun.
The one that never was. Sudden
night dressed in moons.
Feathers pour down as
they follow the sun.
Fly away, I will smile.
Anywhere. May it be North.
May it be East.
Anywhere as long
as you fly within me.
Fly away, golden feathers,
bits of sun.
Meanwhile I will dream.
The night is here.
May your wings not
fall while I sleep.
I love keeping you in.
Are we going to have dinner?
I'll be back in a minute...
Congratulations.
You bought it?
Sign it for me.
I don't know your name.
Gilberto.
I already have what I needed.
I'm leaving for Tijuana tomorrow.
- But we said...
- Its okay.
Thank you.
Thanks to you, man...
I will read it on the road.
Héctor...
Mauricio is still in pain...
- I don't know if we should...
- Leave him.
Why?
He's fine...
- Let him hurt.
- How can you say that?
Look at the big deal you're making
about a fucking headache.
That's why he's a fag, because
of those things you do.
Héctor, you should sleep now.
I really can't hear you say that.
Hello? Hi.
It's one hundred pesos.
Your name?
Javi... Javier.
Let's get out of here.
I've got something to do
and I really have to go.
Why did you come then?
To get out of here. Let's go.
Seriously. I have to go.
And then?
You're going to leave.
I really have to go.
And so do you.
Please, do it for me.
Ask me to be your boyfriend
and then yes...
I will go with you anywhere you want.
You, imbecile...
Alright, stop.
Stop now, dude. Stop now.
- Didn't you hear him say stop?
- No, no...
No, no, no. Don't...
Andrés...
I had a problem. Please,
come pick me up.
Alright...
No, he's lying down
but he can't sleep.
No, he doesn't have a
fever, he's just in pain.
Very well...
and, if it doesn't I'll call
you again, yes...
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Have a good night.
What did he say?
We have to give him some
medication and ...
see how he's feeling in
the morning.
Give it to me.
Give it to me, I'll go...
Andrés...
I'm home...
Are you feeling better?
Well...
Keep resting...
Mom?
Why are you crying?
You are sad because I am
like this, aren't you?
No, no...
No, I swear.
I love you any way you are.
Is my dad very angry?
With me?
No...
He's angry but...
He doesn't know with whom.
Not with you.
Give him some time.
Your aunt's!
Bravo!
Unwrap it! Unwrap it!
- How nice.
- Wear it...
Wear it... Eat it...
Mauricio!
Mauricio!
Come here...
Listen to me.
About what happened, I don't
want it to happen to you again.
I don't want you to be the
first one to punch either...
But if they do it, you have to learn
how to defend yourself, okay?
- Listen...
- Don't speak. Hit it...
Harder.
No, look...
This is face of the one
who punched you.
Like that.
What's up?
- I want you to be with me again...
- I can't.
- Because you're with that guy?
- I can't because I can't...
Because I just don't feel
like hiding anymore.
I miss you very much, Fito.
You miss me because you
saw me with someone else.
I came here to invite you to
have dinner at my house.
Thank you, but no, thanks.
I won't let you down...
I told them already.
- And what happened?
- They didn't throw a party about it...
And there were a couple
awkward days, but...
My mom knows she has to place one
more plate on the table for you.
Thanks.
There is one condition, though...
That I want to introduce
you as my boyfriend.
Do you want to be my boyfriend?
Do people still say that?
You're such an asshole...
You know I do.
Good morning, Love.
4 MOONS.
For TRAPI (My House),
With all My Love.
