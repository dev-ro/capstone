STARRING
I've always wanted to become
a singer in spite of the fact
that Brian Jones died when
he was just 27 years old,
Elvis was 42 when he passed away,, not to mention John
Lennon who was not that old when it occurred to him, too,
I live in a country
that is still very young -
in GDR and if it wasn't that
I would have never had any problems.
I'm listening to a forbidden song right now.
Well. It's not officially forbidden,
but everybody knows it is anyway.
There is a certain department in our neighborhood
where they think all the time about
what they can forbid next.
To tell the truth, they forbid lots
of things and they do that pretty often.
My name's Michael Ehrenreich
and I'm I 7.
There is another wall behind this one:.
A wall that divides Berlin to Eastern and Western part.
The Golden West is in the grasp of a hand.
My street, longer part of which lies in the West,
and the shorter in the East
is called
SUN ALLEY
People who live in the West built terraces
so that they would humiliate us.
You see that GDRer standing over there?.
He's so sweet that you could
fall in love with him.
Come here. Want a chocolate?.
I'll drop you one.
Don't feed the animals!
- Where did you get those awesome clothes from?.
- How's it going?.
It wasn't that bad
but I didn't feel the urge to boast of it...
Besides, it was forbidden to talk,
There were no homeless or hungry people
in our country,
we've had enough food supply
and the prices were stable.
This is Mario,
- Get your hands off it.
- Here's the money.
He's my friend and he also
lives at the Sun Alley.
We mostly spend our time having fun
but today we were tallking about one thing only.
Have you already decided what you're going to tell them?.
Not yet.
I'm going to say "No" for sure.
- Hey, red light.
- So what?.
Hi, Misha,
Hi, Jutta.
- Maybe one day we'll be standing there too?.
- If you say "Yes" then I bet it.
Guys, The Stones are amazing.
I've just heard a track from their new album,
- What are you going to tell us tomorrow?.
- Talke a loolk.
Real Jeans from CiA.
Boaster,
Hi,
Let me tell you something about my new GF.
Give yourself a break.
I asked you if we were going to accept
a three-year-old cantonment.
It's relatively simple for me.
I'm going to study and I think you're going too.
Sure - secondary school certificate and college.
In case we agree
we're going to get into trouble.
Oh, you're such a shirker.
Wasn't it yesterday that you planned
to organize a rebel group
and now you're going to serve the Army for three years?.
Are you nuts?.
This is my father.
Careful, Sabine.
I can see everything.
My mom,
"Careful" is her favorite word.
And that's my sister.
She gets a new boyfriend every week.
This one comes from a political party
Who turned on that blasted telly?.
Lay the table.
- What?.
- You were supposed to lay the table.
But be careful,
Twist the crank,
Eastern shit,
Too high.
That's because it was produced in the East,
- Don't say so. Georg doesn't like it.
- So let him go see his friends in the party.
Moscow, Moscow,
That's forbidden, isn't it?,
Moscow, Moscow,
That's forbidden for sure,
Push the "play"' button, you punk,
That's what I did,
Why is it forbidden?.
Don't you get it?.
Because of the lyrics.
- I knew that.
- It's forbidden anyways.
What is forbidden?.
Put the play,er here, please,
- You didn't understand it the right way, Mr. Sergeant.
- Sergeant Major.
Being forbidden means something totally
different in the youngsters' language.
That's one of our favorite ways to say...
- That something is cool...
- lndeed.
- What is this song about?.
- We can't understand it.
- The only language we learn at school is Russian.
- Thanks God.
I wish I could study in Moscow one day.
- That's why we're listening to this song.
- How do you turn this thing off?.
That's her, Miriam,
Coming right out from a fairy-tale, wonderful, adorable,
unattainable Miriam.
And... I love her.
I'm confiscating this.
I'll listen to it later.
That's a great song.
I collect vinyls myself.
I don't seem to, huh?.
Sometimes I play such songs to my
comrades
so it gets really hot.
You punk.
You may go.
Are you afraid?.
No,
We're hungry.
Those boys, just like those boys
in Africa.
It's so sad,
Herbert, look,
German Democratic Republic border, passport control.
I've lost my passport.
Our relatives from the West.
That's my uncle Heine, who passes the
border a few times in a week.
He's a smuggler,
continuously improving his methods.
Show me your suitcase, please.
Still, my uncle does not smuggle forbidden
magazines, vinyls or pornography.
What he smuggles
is actually absolutely legal.
What do we have here?.
I'm sorry, I've forgotten to take it out.
You must be really poor
to eat such things.
Are you a member of a fascist party?. Yes.
No,
- Did that hurt?.
- I'm going to throw you out, you...
Unlay the table
because it takes up the whole room.
I'm coming.
Come in, Heine.
We've had a small accident.
Did you bring everything?.
Come in, you communists hunter.
That's our regional.
Meet my daughter and her friend.
He's a member of the party,
Is that your forthcoming son-in-law?.
You must be in a hurry...
Please, sit down.
Multifunctional table?,
Has Misha brawled again,
Mr. Sergeant?.
What?.
Sergeant Major.
Next week I'm going to be promoted to an
ensign - that's an officer military grade.
But today you're still a Sergeant Major,
Mr. Sergeant Major?.
That's a subofficer grade, and an ensign
is an officer grade.
Next there are general grades:.
General-ensign, general-major...
- It's different in the NAVY.
...general-colonel...
- Marine, lance-marine...
...and the army general.
...boatswain, lance-boatswain,
frigate captain, corvette captain,
seafaring captain...
then you have the rear-admiral,
vice-admiral...
...and admiral.
- Stop babbling.
That's true,
I've got to go.
There's a lot to be done.
I'll see you out.
Has Misha really not brawled anything?.
Yes, I mean: No.
But I came here officially.
One of the FRG citizens lost her passport.
- I'd like to kindly ask any finder...
- Of course.
If I find it I'll bring it right away,
Mr...
- Sergeant Major.
...Horkefeld.
Good bye...
and lock the door well, please.
68 years old...
I'm sorry, does Miriam Sommer
live in this house?.
Do you live here?.
Sure I do.
Do you happen to know Miriam Sommers?.
That's my sister.
What do you want from her?.
Your sister.
I'll pay, you for a piece of information,
- The "Schachtel Club" single.
- Where am I supposed to get it from for you now?.
You're out of luck, dude.
- You must be Hein's uncle.
- I know, the new Sabrina's boyfriend.
At last.
We were getting really impatient.
You old communists hunter.
You're doing a striptease?.
Only for the housewife.
Don't you think they're too big for me?.
Your size doesn't fit me.
Maybe they'll shrink after boiling.
- Don't you have anything for me?.
- Not this time.
- Nothing for me too.
- Blasted table, I'll make a complaint.
This place is filled with asbestos -
you're going to suffer from a lung cancer.
Maybe at your place.
It's just a matter of time,
Just wait ten years and...
- Ten years?.
- Yes.
We've lived here for such a time actually.
You've got to make a complaint, then.
Misha, I've got something for you.
I smuggled it.
Pants! Great,
Sit down and be more happy.
You probably had a lot problems with those.
No problems at all,
What are you doing?.
A request for party admittance?.
Which one do you want to join?.
Isn't it that you've got only one party here?.
My daughter in the party?.
Never. That's out of the question.
- Is she supposed to fail her life?.
- Georg is in the party as well.
Did I fail my life?.
A Communist Manifest Anniversary is not
a celebration.
I know about it.
Why?.
Leave her alone and better think of
what you're going to say tomorrow at school.
- I'm not going to the Army for three years. That's insane.
- I assume you don't want to study in Moscow?.
A certificate from Moscow is way much more
important here.
What did you just say?.
The boy should either study in Oxford
or Sorbon.
Only mental cripples go to Russian schools.
Do you know who you are?.
You're nothing but a retaliator and inciter.
What's going to happen to you if I go away?.
Where to?.
I don't know,
What is she trying to say?.
Nobody's ever getting out of here.
How come?. We often go to Turinge.
Who was the first to be on the Moon?.
- Leica.
- Camera?.
- Dog.
- We're not talking about dogs here.
- You came from the rotten West.
- From Germany.
I've already explained that to you.
- All of us live in Germany.
- I disagree.
We're all German.
Do you want to serve our national army
for three years?.
I guess that's clear, Misha?.
In such moments one feels so lonely.
Yes.
So now, tell me, in which countries
do children feel very bad?.
In America, France, Scandinavia,,,
We've got to learn how to spoof the girls.
I can't see any problem with that.
Wuschel is going to teach us.
Give me a break.
I'm too young.
Excuse me, young lady...
Can you tell us...
Let me show you.
There's a disco in our school
and with the help of my friends...
Where's the Sun Alley one?.
Actually I don't really know
but it's seventeen there so...
I won't let you have fun of me.
With the help of my friends we wanted...
You want to dig her and you don't
have the slightest idea what to say?.
- What did you tell her?.
- As usual.
She's not going to the disco?.
She doesn't have the time.
Here's the last chance,
- Michael, your turn.
- Why don't we do it later?.
Not those school witches again...
Make me feel better,
- What a disgusting music.
- Can I bring my own vinyls?.
Everything needs to clear out tonight.
Sunglasses.
Wanna dance?.
Excuse me?,
Do you want to dance?.
Can't you see I'm smoking?.
Well, at least he tried.
If that jerk played "The Stones",
we would have surely made it.
Whose red Ford Taurus has got RES 538
registration number?.
Mine,
Follow me, please,
Are you coming or not?.
Who let the class enemy into the school?.
Leave this place, please!
You can do everything in the West.
See you.
- That's Miriam,
- I can see,
- Please.
- Ciao, Bella.
At the next FDJ meeting
we'll take severe action.
Miriam and a guy from the West.
A kiss does not mean anything.
I've got to think of something.
My kids collected recyclable materials
worth I 30 DM.
Mine are worth more than 200,
Together we exceeded the norm.
I painted sunflowers for Angela Davis,
We're so proud of you.
Think of how many sunflowers were
collected in the whole country.
We'll free our friend Angela for sure.
I used to have such a canvasser,
Watch out, she's coming.
Hello,
Why are you so bored?.
It's no Bundestag.
Sit down.
Today we're going to discuss...
Thank you.
THE PARTY AS A PREPUCE OF THE LABOR CLASS
Who's done that?. Franziska?.
- Mario.
- Of course.
It's so sad to see you
behave like a class enemy
and to see that you have absolutely
no respect to our nation
which - under the guidance
of the labor class...
Yes, Misha... what
do you think about it?.
I did it,
You did?.
I'm so disappointed of you,
Misha should be punished as well,
don't you think, friends?.
I'll deliver a self-critical lecture
at the next FDJ meeting.
That sounds like a proper punishment
and an honor for you, simultaneously.
Mario, you've been redeemed.
Where's my Kamil?.
I'm practicing my act,
all for Miriam.
That's Sabina's new boyfriend.
He works in a theatre.
Be serious. You're going to play
Lucile in the school theatre.
Being an actor is no fun,
you've got to treat it seriously.
You'd have to be severely sick to
have your phone line enabled.
Make a complaint,
- You need to have diabetes.
- I can get some sugar.
- He meant people suffering from diabetes.
- I can't smuggle that.
Dear friends,,,
Ieading role and
meaning of a labor party...
...or have a paralyzed child,
like the Meisners.
Your neighbor works in security forces
and also has a phone.
- How come you know where he works?.
- Because he has a phone.
- Then why doesn't he hang out the flag?.
- Because he works in security forces.
But you do hang out the flag.
I'm trying to explain to you that
he works in security forces.
What can we do about it?.
- Do you have to hang out the flag?.
- That's what I was talking about.
Party... Iabor class...
Could you please stop for a while?.
You have to behave like Saint Juices
at the moment of Danton's death
and show to everyone
how you're feeling deep inside.
Or like Brutus:
Rome, citizens, friendship,
There's no proper acoustics but,,,
Dear friends,,,
- What's going on here?.
- What are you asking?.
- Why do you look like that?.
- Yeah.
And just how do you look like?.
It's just an attempt,
If I were you I would be happy to have the
possibility of looking at her in this age.
You've got asbestos here everywhere.
Enough of the problem of the revolution,
now for my personal after-thoughts.
Every member of the FDJ
has got to have his honor.
I'm sure that if my very own boyfriend -
though I have to admit
I have none at the moment -
Ihad gone to the Army for three years,
I would have been loyal to him.
I promise,
We'd like to thank our friend,
Miriam Sommer for her speech.
Do you have any questions?.
I've had enough of Lenin...
party and the labor class.
I never cheated anyone about that
and I landed in some...
real problems,
Today we host a guest from socialist
republic country of Vietnam, Ling Weng
who's going to deliver a speech
about American aggressor.
God dey, comerades...
I doo no speek god Germanish,
only Vietnamese...
Tank you match.
Let's thank Ling Weng for her speech
and let's listen to Michael Ehrenreich.
Dear friends,
Enormous role of social ideology,
labor and party theorists
is unquestionable today.
Marks, Engels, Lenin and... Iove.
You're saying it as if she had undressed
only for you back then.
You're going to get addicted to
a woman first, and then to the system.
How come you know she doesn't have a boyfriend?.
She said herself that even if she had had one,
but she doesn't, don't you understand it?.
You are such a fool.
- Give me a kiss.
- Better not.
- Just for a good-bye.
- No.
Why are you so happy?.
Just take a look what he is wearing.
Soon I'll be going to the Army for three years
and I'll blast all of you off the Earth.
Let's go back.
Your identity card.
Not him again.
Something must have happened... but what?.
I'm watching you, Ehrenreich.
Do it one more time and you'll be dead beef.
And now for the latest hit
from your Sergeant Hokerfeld.
Strictly prohibited.
- Have a good day.
- Get out!
You can buy everything that is forbidden
at the black market.
You can get everything there.
He looks scary.
That guy trades vinyls.
I need something unique.
"Tangerine Dream".
For my exhibition.
Bravo,
- With Alice Cooper's poster?.
- 20 DM.
Why so expensive?.
- Do you have naked ladies?.
- They're down the street.
Let's go.
- Wuschel, your turn.
- I'm not going anywhere.
Don't be scared,
- And?.
- Next time.
I can't do business here,
Hessego vs. Sartre.
- I think I overrated you.
- Wait.
- Saturday Night Fever?.
- I don't do disco music.
What about Kate Bush?.
- Wow-Album?.
- Right.
Terrible wailing.
Get lost. Next.
Original release of "Exile on Mainstreet".
Sure it's original.
Ever thought I was selling crap?.
Have you ever read Sartre?.
You bet, he's great.
We could discuss that.
I'll leave you alone.
Here you go.
I've been waiting for
this moment my whole life.
Originally packed.
- How much?.
- 25.
I'd have to work three months for that,
The Stones recorded this album
in two months.
Go listen to Zappa.
If it wasn't Brian Jones you
would simply forget about the Stones.
I had it in my hands
but I didn't have enough money.
Be it weeks or months,
eventually you'll buy it.
Where's Mario?.
- For instance let's take Hesse,,,
- That's pure insanity.,
- Hesse is metaphysical, esoteric...
- Exactly.
For example "Steppenwolf"',
Steppenwolf is good.
"Born to be wild".
That's a song,
and "Steppenwol" is a rock band.
You will never be free unless
you free the others.
Do you understand what I'm saying?.
What Jean meant?.
Who?.
Jean Paul.
Sartre.
You will never be free...
until you free the others.
Now do you get it?.
So you're going to shoot somebody now,
are you, you blasted fools?.
That's our neighbor from
the security forces.
- Good evening, do I disturb you?.
- No.
- I wanted to ask you about something.
- Good evening, Mr. Fromm.
- Where do you actually work?.
- We'll talk about it some other time.
The reason I'm asking you this is
because of your irregular working times...
Misha, come home,
Don't disturb that man,
- Your son is very interesting.
- He wants to study in Moscow.
The wall must go down.
That's my indocile immediate from the West.
Could you lend me two blankets of yours
for our guests who came to the youth congress?.
- I'll see what I can do.
- We've brought a few people to put up.
We have to support FDJ.
Now wasn't that clever?,
I bet he's writing a delation about us
to his leading officer.
What are you doing?.
Why are you whistling?.
This world is crazy.
I don't want to be buried here,
It can always be worse.
What is actually going on in here?.
You're no longer wearing your glasses...
And who's that?.
- That's Uwe, my love.
- What?.
Good day.
He's a catholic
and he's been to the seminary.
I'd always dreamt of being a grandmother.
I no longer want to and
I'm fed up with all of this.
I can't take it any more.
That's for Boris,
A phone.
You can even find us in a phone book.
Thanks God,
God had nothing to do with that.
It was a doctor, not him.
I got a testimonial
that I'm seriously ill.
That I suffer from epilepsy,
There is some truth in this,
Shut up.
Who knows our number?.
It's in a phone book,
It's quite voluminous,
What now?.
You've got to pick up the phone.
But be careful,
Don't worry.
Ehrenreich family's flat here.
Misha, it's for you.
Miriam?,
- I didn't expect it'd be for you,
- Don't confuse him,
- Ask him whether she can hear you clearly.
- From a phone book?.
He's got a girlfriend.
What's her voice like?.
- Dad, stop it.
- Can she hear you well?.
I'll call back in a sec,
Bring her here!
- The best form of attack is defense.
- Ask her whether she could hear you clearly.
Don't make an asshole out of yourself.
Damn,
Eastern shit,
Not at the border neighborhood.
- A spy?.
- Fugitive.
Cheers.
Just you wait.
One more time.
It's going to begin soon.
Miriam,,, I couldn't talk,
I'm in the phone booth
right under your window.
- Come to me.
- What?.
I'm coming.
Your identity card.
Wait, I'll bring it.
An identity card is a document you always
have to carry.
Whoever does not have it at the border
neighborhood
is to be brought to the post
for identification purpose.
- Arrest him.
- He should be shot.
I've warned you, Ehrenreich.
For a minute I've felt as
if I were a real artist.
Mario... did you like it?.
Do you think Sartre had exactly
this on his mind?.
Sure, he's a Frenchman.
That's a point,
My shoes are all wet.
So after ten hours
my mother finally came for me.
For me you're a hero.
Oh, spare the words.
I've been thinking about Miriam all the time
and thanks to that it was easier for me.
I can understand you.
I can think about her all day long,
it's a wonderful feeling.
Just like with that Stones' album.
I guess it's kind of different.
That's Sabrina,
- We're both keen on art.
- We're together.
- Are you getting addicted to the system?.
- What?.
We've had a tiny row.
That's something completely different.
- Do you want to get married?.
- What are you talking about?.
My parents are going out tomorrow
and I'd like to make a party.
I'll bring some drugs along.
Where are you going to get them from?.
From the chemist's,
I've got to go.
Is your sister home?.
She was waiting for you yesterday.
It was a political matter.
I'd like to invite her to
a party, here's the address.
These are asthmatic's herbs
but we make drugs out of them.
I've got a question.
What's inside?.
Datura, horsetail and deadly nightshade.
We give everything away into a glass...
We want to see Sabrina.
Damn her, she's got a real house.
And now we add some cola.
This is Birgit.
We're lesbian.
You've got a problem?.
- Did you bring some vinyls?.
- I'm privately here.
- Is it tasty?.
- That's not what it's for.
You're right.
Careful, these are antique instruments.
If something happens to them,
my father is going to be really pissed off.
Is Miriam home?,
No, but go to the kitchen.
Sabrina will serve you with drugs.
Whipsters.
What did you say?.
Can't you smoke on the balcony?.
My father will be angry.
- Hey, is that for your mom?.
- What?.
- Aren't your parents home?.
- If they were we would not make a party.
- I need a room for my happening.
- What?.
- This one is ideal.
- Are you Sabrina's friend too?.
Now for the drinking.
What's crucial is that you have
to drink to the bottom.
Cheers.
What's the problem?.
I don't know if I should...
Miriam's coming soon.
You're going to feel relaxed.
It's really nice in here.
- Did you like that blonde?.
- I didn't say anything like that.
I saw a glare in your eyes.
Can you feel anything?.
No... you?.
Nothing.
I'll go to the balcony.
I was looking for you.
There's got to be a bath somewhere here.
Damn, a spot came out on my face,,,
and Miriam has not come yet.
Can you feel anything?.
No.
I'll check at the balcony
whether Miriam's coming.
Do you think she's going to come?.
It's time for a protest,
Urine knows no limits.
That's Miriam,
She's coming.
What am I going to do
about that blasted spot?.
I've got to think of something.
Let's rise to the heavens,
I can see double,
Everybody's gone mad.
It's superb,
Hi, Misha,
Make a squaw out of her,
That's my work of art.
I've had some balance disturbances
but they're gone.
I'm fed up with your babbling,
I can really understand the reason
you did not want to stay there.
We're so similar to each other.
I can feel exactly what you feel.
As the years passed I used to write all my
reflections to countless diaries.
And suddenly you emerge,
out of nowhere, thinking
exactly the same way I do.
- I'd love to read them.
- What?.
Those countless diaries,
There are times everything is against you.
I'll talk to the head-master myself.
Sure.
She really likes me.
- I wouldn't utter a word anyway.
- Let me speak.
I don't feel well,
A visit from the Safety Department.
My duties include reading hostile
newspapers. On a daily basis.
There are worse things.
You will never be free unless
you free the others. That's what
Sartre used to say.
Now he's an existentialist, isn't he?,
The toilet clogged. We had
to pee somewhere, didn't we?.
Besides, hostile newspapers lie,
you read it every day.
That must be some sort of a trap,
We've made a mistake
and we're asking for your forgiveness.
Right?. Can't you see?.
We did apologize.
You peed on our antifascist wall,
you peed on our country
where Ernest Halmann comes from,
not to mention thousands of his comrades.
You have not shown respect to graves of those
thanks to whom you can live and learn
in a free country.
Mario Naujoks is no longer
a student of our school.
Get out of my sight.
And you, Ehrenreich...
are getting a reprimand.
Leave,
Back then Mario was experiencing
the best moments of his life.
He was getting the taste of freedom
with Sabrina.
They were always on the road
and it actually didn't matter to them
that their motorcycle was so slow.
Hi, Misha,
Remember I asked you to lend me
your diaries?.
Well, first I have to find them all,
especially those from the childhood.
I'm waiting.
- Are you sick?.
- Give me a break, I've got lots to do.
Need a hand?,
I don't want anyone to disturb me.
- Good day, I'm Olaf from Drezno.
- I'm Udo.
Our guests are here.
I'm Olaf from Drezno,
I came to the youth congress.
- That's our new tenant.
- We're from the same union.
He's quite pale. Aren't you afraid
to live so close to the border?.
Here's the kitchen,
Good day, I'm Olaf from Drezno.
These are our tenants. Register in
the registration book, please.
Western TV.
Dear diary.
At last I can write about everything I think,
now that I know all the letters.
Today I learnt how to draw the
h letter and I can write a very important word
that I use very often:
Shit.
The player has to recognize objects,
lying on the tape.
If she manages to do so,
she's allowed to take them home.
Seriously?.
She failed again.
A cafe express, globe...
I turned I 4 today and I was given
my first identity card.
Starting from today I'm a number...
A number... yes, a number.
A personal distinctive number...
of a system... of an inhuman system.
Great.
I turned I 4,
It actually receives three channels.
We don't have that.
- I'm going to watch it till the end.
- Ditto.
Move, please,
What is it?.
What are you waiting for?.
We don't want to spend
the night on the border.
I'm going to sleep.
Now I'm going to write
about the country I live in.
- I haven't done anything.
- Let's go.
Follow me, please,
Of course.
I suspect you of something,
Do you know what one can be suspected of
when he or she visits us so often?.
Of course, that you are
a friend of our system.
Here, hi-fi, Japan.
Someone tried to smuggle it
but you can't play tricks on us.
What do you think?.
Have a closer look,
it's very complex.
Here's our good ol' radio:
It's got a switch,
a speaker,
plastic casing,
tones controller.
It takes too much space,
Absolutely unnecessarily.
I'm sorry but you can get a cancer,
using it -
you've got asbestos everywhere in here.
In the West they say that you can get
a cancer from those fillings as well.
And, actually, I've never had one.
While we're building socialism,
they're afraid of cancer
and build radios that they even
don't know how to use.
They're bound to lose.
Everything is so gray.
Like an ash,
This country hurts you like
a shoe that's too small.
You can't move in it, it's only
dreams that you're left with.
Maybe I should try to escape?.
At last.
Nobody's going to take it away from me.
No wonder everybody ran away from here,
and everybody that stayed dreams of escaping,
and if somebody does not
then he's going to do so soon.
Two systems.
I decided to flee to the West,
Darkness,
Increased risk of decampment.
Alert.
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
Shoot the flares.
You're going to leave me alone here?.
Or our baby?.
Yes, Sir, increased readiness.
I was terrified by fear
when I glazed into the barrels
of soviet machine-guns.
Wuschel, what's wrong with you?.
Say something.
It's broken,
Both of them,,,
It was a double album,
I'm waiting for something
that is never going to take place.
I decided to find a resistant group
which would consist of my friends
who knew what life is all about
and who treat it seriously.
Order disobeying.
Do you know what it means?.
Yes.
We'll show you the dictatorship of proletariat.
- I already know it.
- That's what you think.
I'm happy to see you,
comrade Gumprecht.
Mario?,
What are you doing here?.
Here you are.
We've been waiting for you.
I was put through too much,
I had muck past,
I had no work,
and I'm going to be a father soon.
It was you who said you need to
mix everything from inside.
Who's that Suzi?.
Suddenly you become an adult,
partings and misfortunes multiply.
I yearn whole-heartedly.
Just imagine that Mr. Fromm works
in a funeral company.
- Uncle Heine's dead.
- He died of cancer.
Poor dear,
Can l?.
He's going to be so alone
in that wooden box.
You're going to be let go, he's your brother,
for God's Sake - first generation kinship.
Had he lived here,
he could have lied next to our mom,
I whole-heartedly yearn.
He was a good man,
a friend of our system.
My mother finally found herself
in the Golden West.
Just coffee.
I appreciate your sincerity.
but we are not going to hassle
about a coffee can.
I'm back,
I thought that I was going to wash
my socks to the end of my life.
I'm telling you, it's so colorful in there.
Here's a surprise - I smuggled it for you.
Coffee is quite legal,
I didn't even have to smuggle it.
Wasn't there any other?.
Take a peek inside,
That's not a coffee,
No - that's uncle Heinz,
You smuggled uncle Heinz?.
Without any formalities.
He fit right into.
He's become kind of small,
Here we come,
Can I help you?.
No, I'm fine,
- Is your sister home?.
- How can I know?.
- Can you go bring her here?.
- Go by yourself.
Here's my life, lying under your feet.
50 DM.
Is that enough?.
Sure.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
50 Western is equal to
250 Eastern.
Thank you, God.
And I thought that those from the West
are better at kissing.
I'll show you how you can control it.
Please say: Open the boot.
When he does you look right into inside and...
Comrade Orlowski, please come here.
Alert.
Combat alert.
Sometimes you are so lucky
that you cannot even imagine.
I work at the hotel,,, please,,,
I'm only parking my car.
Look, I bought it for I 50 DM.
People need music,
Take a look at this,
Stones' maiden album.
- Is that Keith's guitar?.
- It's going to be introduced in a minute.
No shit, this can't be Stones,
Pay attention.
What a great solo.
A sensational Stones' song
that no one has listened to yet...
Seriously.
That's so not true,
That bastard has deceived me,
he has stuck false labels on,
Bullshit.
Let me show you.
These are the Stones.
Unreleased songs.
We're the first to hear them.
They're forbidden.
Come on! We're hitting the road!
Comrade Lieutenant,
something's happening at the balcony at the
second floor in the border neighborhood zone.
A proper evaluation of the situation
is not yet possible.
What are you saying to this net?.
I'm not talking to my net,
my lady.
Are they allowed to do so?.
Well... We can't do a thing.
There used to be a country
I had lived in.
I've spent the most memorable
moments of my life there.
It was the time I was young and in love.
STARRlNG
Your identity card.
You've got asbestos everywhere in here.
It seems to me that you've got some questions.
I've thought exactly the same thing.
We've got to talk.
Get lost, asshole.
I whole-heartedly yearn.
Rome, citizens, friendship,
Be always prepared!
