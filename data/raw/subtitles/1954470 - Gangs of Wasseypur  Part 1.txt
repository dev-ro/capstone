Let's go! It's clear.

Come out asshole!
Come out fucker!
Fuck your mom!
C'mon!
Open the door!
He has locked it.
Wait!
- Get the bomb.
- Give me the bomb!
Wait!

Stick a gun in every window.
Turn this fortress into ruins
Give me the bomb!
Get down Jabbar!
Kill them all!
Come out Faizal!
Where are you holed up?
Come out!
Come out you son of a bitch!
Yes, Qasim!
I have found the back door
Give me the order!
Orders? Just fucking kill everyone!
Understood! Kill everyone
Fix a bomb.
Stick a gun in the
windows and shoot.
Fire upstairs.
Come fast.
Kill every last one
of the sisterfuckers.
Fire!
This damn door!
Fire!
Whose call it is?
The phone is ringing.
No one is picking it up.
Ring is over.
Fucking sons of bitches are dead.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Faizal Khan is dead!
Let's go.
The "villain" is dead.
We'll read it in the papers,
who died and who survived.
Would be fun to read!
Qasim!
Move!
Let's go back.
How did you kill Vinod?
I was about to shoot Vinod
on his ass but he came to my front.
Lets call J.P. and tell him
We'd have got him with us.
That looks like Definite's car,
let's kill him.
Leave him, let him pick up the bodies.
Anchor asked our representative on TV
Tell me our national anthem
So he started singing.
Vande Matram!
Vande Matram!
Thats our state representative for you.
So you tell me the right one?
- Hello!
- Mr J.P., Faizal Khan is dead
We riddled his fortress
with grenades and bullets.
Brother!
Stop the car!
It's a police check post
Hey J.P., why this police
check post is here?
What do we do now? Shall we go?
J.P. disconnected the phone.
Leave it! Let's go.
This check post is for us.
- Jabbar!
- Yes.
That sisterfucker.
What are you doing?
No, don't shoot!
Fire!
Die!
There are two kind of
people in this world.
Dicks and Assholes,
and this is a
game that these two play
Now when will some dick
start acting like an asshole,
or when some asshole
starts fucking around...
you never know.
The tale of Wasseypur is complicated.
On the outside...
Wasseypur looks like a normal place.
But on the inside...
it's full of bastards...
They may end up
as either dick or asshole,
but as long as they are alive...
everyone wants to be a big dick.
Us Muslims have been
fighting each other for centuries...
But in Wasseypur this fight
was not between Shia and Sunni
All of us were Sunni here.
This fight was between
Qureshis and other muslims...
It turned into a war pretty late,
used to be one sided earlier.
Qureshis were butchers,
and people shat their
pants when up against them.
Qureshis dominated Wasseypur...
when this village
was just outside Dhanbad
and Dhanbad used to be
a part of Bengal
After freedom
Dhanbad went to Bihar
and Wasseypur was
swallowed by Dhanbad
Now Dhanbad is in Jharkandh
And Wasseypur is
in the centre of Dhanbad
Anyways!
The fued is still on!
But it all started...
when around Dhanbad...
British took over
the paddy fields
and started mining coal
At that time trains
ran with coal...
and so did all the
factories and machines.
Sultana Dacoit used to
live here at that time...
and he robbed their trains
That man attacked on british
trains and robbed their goods
One train was carrying
soldiers instead of goods.
when Sultana
attacked that train
the British arrested
him and sent him to blackwaters
My Moulvi told me that
the British executed him Calcutta
Shut up!
Your Moulvi is a fuckwit.
Actually Sultana was a Qureshi
And one of the two men to
escape blackwaters, ever!
- Sultana Dacoit?
- Yes.
Is he alive?
- Yes.
He is here, in Wasseypur.
The brits are still
looking for him...
and he's still
robbing their trains
C'mon!
Get in!
We have stripped
the tracks old man.
If you will try to move, you'll die.
There is nothing
In train but food bags
I don't mind.
We are not Dacoits
who came to rob the money
We have quit robbing the treasury...
Now Sultana only steals food.
May I go?
Look old man,
You have a train.
and I have a bullock cart.
So until I return
and ask you to leave
you stay the fuck here...
Sit down!
Sit down!
Quick! Hurry up!
Don't slack off like
those skinny Qureshis
Hurry up!
- Why is the train already stopped?
- I don't know
- Check the wagons...
- Okay.
Hey Driver,
Why did you stop the train?
Sir, the train is empty
Why are all the wagons empty?
Sultana Dacoit came...
he took it all...
There is someone who is
impersonating me.
Who could he be?
Who?
Shahid Khan!
He is only person with a horse around here.
- Salaam!
- Salaam!
But he used to drive a carriage?
Used to...
but now he sells foodgrains...
How is your business?
Entire market is screwed up...
He is selling the stock dirt cheap.
Says it's subsidised.
We'll go broke trying
to compete with him...
5...6...7...
Hey Shahid!
When is your wife
expecting a baby?
About 2 months.
Rest is upto Allah.
11...
Train track passes through
the Qureshi neighbourhood
Only Qureshis live on
either side of the track
So Qureshis have the first
right on every train,
not Pathans.
Look here Shareef!
I just want to tell you one thing
Whatever you do...
there shouldn't be bloodshed.
Shahid also belongs
to Wasseypur
But he isn't one of us...
If we'll get caught we'll
apologize to Mukhtar Sahab
He won't kill us
What if he does?
He won't do it
I know him
A Dog never changes it's breed
If you don't flog a horse
it will never run
Shahid was
just as stubborn.
His life was in danger
Everyone knew that who
was robbing the trains...
But he never gave a fuck.
Insolence was in his blood.
Dark clouds were on the horizon...
it had to rain someday
Are you scared?
Do you know who is Shareef Qureshi?
You are using his name
The real Sultana died in black water
and the rest are just urban legends...
- He is a butcher
- So what the fuck will he do?
Us pathans kept thousands
of them as servants.
Qureshis are fucking skinny
as the goats they slay.
And tomorrow we will stop
the train before it reaches the signal.
Hit it hard.
It's not coming out.
Those bastards are here!
Run for your lives
Let's go.
Don't spare anyone alive.
Kill every last one of them.
How are you feeling?
- Better.
- Lie down!
Chief!
Where is everyone?
Only I survived.
They killed all of them!
You said they wouldn't
have done anything.
Tell him to leave
Wasseypur with his family.
We'll leave...
but ask him how I will feed my family
beside the fuck I have done to him?
Son of a bitch impersonates me and
talks shit, motherfucker!
Get the fuck out, son of a bitch.
One bag of grains, from every train
will reach to your
home from within a week of robbery.
Yeah right...
I won't give him shit.
Shahid Khan
left to save his life.
but he was'nt a coward
He knew that Qureshi
won't spare him
We settled down in Dhanbad.
Shahid's wife made
him swear on his unborn child...
that he will quit crime...
and find a job.
Bear a little pain.
Bear it, my dear.
Bear it!
Call her husband.
Please stop the work
Water is pouring inside...
Everyone will drown
Fuck off! Do your work!
Barely 9 hours in a 12 hour shift...
But... everyone will drown...
Everybody is working.
Then whats your fucking problem
Fuck off!
Son of a bitch.
Excuse me!
What?
Shahid Khan! He works here.
His baby is stuck
in his wife's womb
So?
Please give him news.
It's important.
No need to, piss off now.
Nobody will stop
the work before 12 hours
If anyone does
then I will fleece his skin
and hang it in butcher's market
Please, Shahid Khan's
wife is serious.
Please give this news to him.
What are you blabbering?
Do your work! Don't talk!
What the
fuck are you looking at?
I have to go.
Kid is stuck in wife's womb!
Well it ain't
stuck up your ass.
Get back to work!
Please, let me go!
You don't get it, do you?
Don't worry.
Have patience!
Have patience!
Open the gate!
Why?
Are you the fucking Governor?
I am not one of those people
who will take shit from you.
I have done my work honestly.
If I get late today...
I swear I will gut you
and shove burning coal inside you.
Open it.
Open it.
How is she?
- She is in pain!
- So why the fuck are you late?
I wanted to...
he won't let me.
It's been 6 hours
but kid is not coming out.
Motherfucker!
What were you doing for 6 hours?
I was coming but...
he pushed me away.
Why didn't you kill him!
She's dead.
She had heavy bleeding.
She was in great pain.
She gave birth to a cute son.
Take care.
We can't blame God
for life and death
We give life with our
wish and sometimes by mistake
but people
die from our mistakes
It wasn't
that Henchman fault
who didn't let me come in
It was my fault...
that I was weak...
and only I have to suffer
for my weakness...
Sir! Shahid Khan will kill our man.
Shahid Khan who?
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
When the world...
will sleep,
at the stroke of the midnight hour...
India will awake to life.
The real war began
after the freedom.
After the British
left, all the mines...
were distributed to Tata,
Birla and Thapar.
But there were very
few who understood the industry
And Ramadhir benefited
the most by this decision.
He became a big shot
And he started
supervising a few mines...
But without the
Henchmen neither the British...
nor these businessmen,
not even Ramadhir, could run the mines.
Will you work for me?
I'm already your employee.
Will you be my Henchman?
You won't lack anything in life.
- Yes.
- Now, I've got the contract of these mines.
All the coals produced
here will be mine.
Profit, loss, everything is mine.
After the British left,
labours think that...
the workload will reduce
and they'll get more wages.
But it can't be done.
We've to increase the production.
For which we need more coal.
We've got to dig it more.
We've got to dig a new mine...
on the place where
the labours live.
Get lost!
British had money.
So they provided salary
as well as shelter.
We're don't have funds for that.
We'll pay them by which they can
arrange their shelter on their own.
What happened?
Why aren't you working?
Sir, we've been met with injustice.
Our houses are set on fire.
We've got families.
I'm going inside to take a leak.
I shouldn't see anyone
here when I come out.
C'mon, get back to your work!
Get lost! Join your duty.
But you're one of us.
Get lost!
C'mon!
Do you want an invitation? C'mon.
- Shahid!
- Yes.
You think...
you're treating
your friends correctly?
No one is a friend here.
British had left a piece of bread.
And monkeys are fighteing over it.
And what do you think?
Ramadahir Singh
inherited the mines?
First British ran a cartel...
and now Ramadhir Singh.
And in future, I'll own the
mines by killing Ramadhir Singh.
Shahid Khan!
I'll see!
Yes!
Boss wants him.
He's in the jeep.
Yes, I'll send him.
Ramadhir Singh is waiting
for you in the jeep.
Why is he here?
It's very special delivery.
It has to reach Benares this night.
Varanasi?
A train will leave from
Dhanbad station in 20 minutes.
I've got your ticket.
Let's go.
I didn't inform my son,
he'll wait for me.
I'll send a message.
C'mon Let's go to sleep.
Whose umbrella it is?
It was lying here.
Really? Show me.
Ramadhir Singh?
Fuck! they ran away!
- The child?
- He's dead.
And the dead body?
Chopped and buried.
Mr Yadav? Shahid Khan.
Mr Ramadhir...
has sent money.
It's pistol, right?
Can I have a look?
Running and rattling...
playing with the rocks...
changing it's side every now and
then, what's made of water drops?
That has four letter name?
Ganga!
Shahid Khan didn't return.
We knew he will never.
Sardar grew up
with my nephew Asghar.
One day he asked me...
about Shahid Khan.
I told him that Ramadhir
Singh had his father killed.
After that
Sardar's childhood ended.
He started thinking
about Ramadhir only.
Since then he took an oath...
that he
won't grow hair...
until he'd avenge
his father's death.
C'mon, anyone for Girdi...
Jaliya.
Dhanbad! Ranchi! Wasseypur!
- Will you come?
- No.
C'mon, anyone for Girdi?
Girdi! Jaliya! Ranchi!
Dhanbad!
Girdi!
Jariya! Dhanbad! Wasseypur!
Girdi! Ranchi! Dhanbad! Wasseypur!
Girdi!
Saradar Khan, son of Shahid Khan...
your marriage with Ms Nagma,
daughter of Imtiyaz Ahmed...
has been fixed
over a gift of Rs 500...
Do you accept this marriage?
Yes! I do...
- Do you accept this marriage?
- Yes! I do...
- Do you accept this marriage?
- I do.
Do you accept this marriage?
Do you want water?
Sardar!
Coming!
10 trucks of Ramadhir
Singh will leave from Jariya.
Let's empty them.
He killed my father
My father sat in his
car and left with him
he never came back
My only mission in life is...
Revenge!
I can't see Ramdheer Singh
live up to old age.
I have to finish that bastard
I won't shoot him
I will taunt him as I screw him.
I will show him his place and...
slowly I will take his every thing.
Motherfucker will die on his own...
Respectable Mr Ramadhir Singh.
Long live!
Long live!
Long live!
I am standing on this
stage and promise you
that we'll defeat the opposition.
In 1952, Jagjivan
Raam became Labour Minister
and he announced Coal
Welfare Association for labour issues...
as per that the...
National Trade Union was founded
following which the
Owners were driven out of business...
by supervisors under
the leadership of Ramadhir Singh.
This trade union
became the first face of Mafia.
Union Leader
became contractors
and forced labours
to become union members
They gave money on interest
and kept their
salaries as installments...
What will I eat from this?
New contractors came one by one
Ramadhir Singh was
already a contractor.
He became a politician
and won the election, too.
My dad, Ramadhir Singh,
ran coal mines for many years.
Mr S.P. Sinha, I know how...
other contractors and labours...
steal coal and
sell in black markets...
I won't do that.
but I want a
greater piece of pie...
Coal is a great thing
It looks like stone
but it's not dense like stone
it's lighter...
if you will immerse it in water...
it will soak it up.
and become... heavier...
- 16 Tons...
- Is it?
- Yes.
- Come in.
This nationalisation of mines...
has been hard on labours.
Our own union...
the Union for labours.
It's lending us money and
taking our salaries as interests.
And how it's happening
It's all happening under
Coal India Chief...
Stop, where are you going?
I have told you
that my share should
be same like other contractors
I am sending the
stuff as demanded...
You're sending it J.P. Singh...
but it's not reaching there.
As long as S.P. Sinha lives...
we will struggle
to make a living...
What do you think?
S.P. Sinha is just a paper pusher...
scribbling in his office...
Has no fucking idea
how people steal...
We don't have food to eat.
And he is gardening
outside his house.
You shouldn't break the flower
Just play with it. okay?
Hey, Ramadhir!
Catch him!
With nationalisation, government
took the mines back from Ramadhir...
and handed them over to Coal
India, headed by S.P. Sinha.
Ramadhir was downgraded
from owner to contractor.
And after killing S.P. Sinha
Ramadhir gained a reputation...
which made him
the first don of Dhanbad.
Your father was a great man.
Move.
Where is Sardar Khan?
Sardar Khan, seen him?
Bald guy?
Sardar Khan!
In the opposite room.
Who's it?
What do you mean?
Bitch said that she is Nagma.
She said she is Nagma?
And you too think she is Nagma.
You think I am a fuckwit?
I was wasted, I didn't realise!
Did you imagine this was your house?
Were sleep walking?
Seriously. I was wasted!
She took advantage of me!
No...
What are you doing? She will die
Let her die
- There'll be a murder.
- Move.
Leave it. She'll get hurt.
I said move, or else I'll kill you.
Listen to me.
I won't spare you alive
Leave it.
Nagma!
Stop!
Where are you running coward!
Some day you will
come home bastard!
Fucking whoremonger!
Calm down!
Have patience.
Push!
Get lost!
My son!
My prince!
Smile!
Smile for me!
Smile for me!
Smile for me!
Take him!
My child!
My prince!
My child!
Please forgive me
- What is it?
- I don't know.
What is it?
Just there's something.
Nothing could happen right now
Why?
I am pregnant again...
So, I am not taking him out.
Don't you feel any shame?
You will make your kid dirty?
Son, this is not right...
When your wife is pregnant...
you should control your self
You're right.
I'm tired of telling him.
He was born horny.
He should be a lone stud
in a stable of mares.
When Danish was to be born...
nine months passed away.
Even after his birth,
one month passed almost dry...
And now she's carrying again.
C'mon, the food is ready.
Coming.
What should I do?
Should I live my life or not?
I have lived a celibate life...
That doesn't count as living.
You want to quench your lust...
go anywhere you want.
Just don't bring anyone home.
Otherwise, I'll kill her.
And wherever you go,
shower before you come here.
Who's going out?
Shut up and eat your food.
You'll get vigor from it.
You wouldn't want to be
embarassed in front of whores...

You pay for fuel...
and monthly salary...
You can fill the tank from my pump.
When not in your service...
can I use it on rent?
Fill the tank.
and this too. Okay?
J.P. gave Asghar
contract for driving his jeep.
He used to get the tanks full...
and sell it to other drivers as well.
Sardar became J.P.'s chauffeur.
Uncle... did you read this?
Yes, and I read
between the lines as well...
All these five petrol pumps are in
the names of Radmadhir's wife...
and his daughters and sons-in-law.
Eat it first and then talk.
Asghar!
Shall we go and fill the tank?
Listen! Fill the tank.
Where shall I fill it?
There's no tank mouth.
You need to turn the jeep around.
How many trucks would
usually come here?
Around 100 or 200?
500!
500!
Is it? Really?
Yes.
Hey! 500 trucks fill
the tanks from here.
Damn!
What are you doing, sir?
Fuck off son of a bitch!
Where's the key?
This is Ramadhir Singh's pump.
What did you say?
Ramadhir Singh's pump.
It's our representative's
petrol pump.
Hey, you're lucky.
Free petrol for everyone!
Take as much as you want.
Now don't be shy!
Hey!
Did you kill him?
Don't know.
Let's go.
Start the jeep.
Fucking sandals!
C'mon, let me go first.
Yes, get in.
C'mon, start.
The last compartment of
the goods train is in my name.
My men will load it with iron.
We'll unload it here.
You look after the documents.
Slowly!
Careful!
Come, let's sit here.
- Hello, Guard.
- Hello!
Sir, aren't you in-charge
of that goods train.
Yeah...
Don't move.
Or else I'll rip you open...
Uncle, signal the driver to stop
and while I handle him.
Don't kill him.
C'mon...
it's our train.
Start unloading the last two wagons.
Quick!
C'mon, hurry up.
- You got some water.
- Yeah.
Open it.
You see this land?
From there upto the mine...
Who owned
the land we captured?
Fuck it...
We took it anyways...
Wicked plan...
Where have you brought me?
Someone is...
encroaching on your land
Who?
Who's is it?
Sardar Khan!
Sardar Khan who?
The one who drives Asghar's
jeep at the station.
Works as our chauffeur...
From when did he get the balls?
Call him to my office.
He won't come.
Why?
I told him to.
But he said you must come
to him to make a deal.
And what will he do if
we put up our henchmen here?
Till now, he was our driver.
And now he'll deal with us?
- J.P.! - I'll kill him.
- J.P.!
That guy wants to troll you...
Let him do it.
If he wants to troll,
let him troll.
You shouldn't be feeding him.
So, what do we do?
Use all legal means
at your disposal.
Dhanbad falls in your
constituency, right?
Invite the police chief for lunch.
We'll feed this fucker barbed wire,
string it from his rectum
and fly him like a kite right here...
Okay...
Ward off the evil eye off us.
We need all the luck.
- Give it to me.
- Salaam!
Dad?
Ramadhir Singh didn't
recognize Sardar
Perhaps not even me,
I think he
saw me with Shahid.
But he did
recognise his umbrella.
It was an age...
when rich
people forgot their names
but they never
forgot their belongings...
Do you have papers
for your land?
If it's your land
then show me the papers.
Land belongs to my people.
I have already made a deal
Stay off it fuckwit...
it won't be good for you.
Think and speak!
Learn the difference between
owning and encroaching.
Here's the land papers
I have bought it for mere 10 rupees
10 rupees?
Do you know what's your worth?
Son of a bitch!
I'll bury you right here!
- Shut up!
- J.P.!
Hey chief, it would be better for
everyone if it doesn't escalate.
Move... move out.
Move!
Dear state representative
No matter how big the balls get...
they always hang around a dick...
You don't know me!
How dare you hit a
state representative
You don't know who I am?
When you'll go home and
scratch your daddy's bunghole
ask him who am I?
How many days will I be imprisoned
for assaulting a representative...?
And I too would like
to get jailed, sir.
How dare you?!
Father!
Why didn't you?
Start the car!
Did you understand?
Did you get it now fuckwit?
Son of a bitch!
You will appoint anyone
without any background checks!
I'll kill you.
I didn't know...
Look! Everyone look at your
representative being assaulted!
He was petting a snake
What are you doing?
Why are you beating him?
If you will interfere,
I'll slit your throat.
You gave birth to this useless cunt!
Wants to be a
representative, fuckwit!
Forget it.
I smashed representative J.P. Singh
in police chief's office!
In front of his father.
My name is Sardar Khan
Let everyone know...
What did I do?
Smashed him.
In the police chief's office.
In front of his father.
- Salaam!
- How are you?
Please come.
Here Ehsan, sit here.
Come! Sit here.
Last night I saw a nightmare.
Do you remember Shahid Khan?
He used to work for me.
He came to your dreams.
Did he come in your dream?
His son
His son's ghost came to my dream.
Whom you chopped and buried.
Where did you bury him?
Where?
Do you remember?
Yeah, somewhere...
Do one thing...
dig up his grave...
and bring his bones.
Priest was saying that...
his body is still alive.
And he is haunting me.
Okay.
Son of a bitch!
At least stop lying
now, Son of a bitch.
Otherwise I will
kill you and bury there.
I made a mistake.
You have no idea about the drama
your mistake has caused...
He is Pappu,
from Punjab.
He is expert in bombs...
- Will you make bomb?
- I will...
What do you need?
- Potash. - And?
- I will need Sulpher? - And?
- Coal powder.
- Will you make it? - Yes.
Where?
To deliver food.
- Who?
- To my dad.
Open it.
- What did I tell you?
- Stop hitting me!
Do it properly.
- Where to?
- I've brought food for my dad.
Will you squeek like that?
You have balls, haven't you?
You are my son, not of a two
rupee whore your dad fucked.
I am Sardar Khan's son.
I've got food for him.
- What?
- Food!
Open it!
Why? Do you want to taste it?
Potash!
What's this?
Broken glass and nails.
This is shrapnel.
How much time it will take?
I am making bomb not tea.
It will take time
Celebrate your next Eid here
Wrap it fast.
I will have to tie it
tight otherwise it won't explode.
Guards will smash our
faces if they see us...

Hurry up.
Come, fast Pappu!
Throw the bomb on the wall
What?

Can't be found, can't be found,
can't be found...
21 convicts escape Dhanbad Jail.
Here.
Enough!
Getting the shivers again?
Shamshad!
She has come from Asansol.
Some people don't teach
any etiquettes to their women
She walks around like a slut.
Some day butchers will
see her then they will rape her
But what is she doing here?
Sultan brought her here to make her a hooker.
She hid in mosque last night
And then came here.
- Food is tasty.
- Yes.
Where shall I wash my hands?
What kind of family are you from?
Do you know me?
Are you mute?
Are you married?
You've grown up.
But haven't married as yet?
Let me help you carry this.
Look at me.
Look at me once.
Why are you shivering?
Never been touched yet?
Listen!
Take it away.
Hey... Hey!
Hey...
Four marriages are
allowed, Allah said so.
How can I refuse Allah?
There must be some reasons
why He wants me to have four wives?
So that four families will prosper.
Yes.
This is your fucking problem.
You just think about yourself.
Selfish!
Yeah right, I am the
one being selfish.
You're right.
Danish!
Danish!
Danish!
What's it? Why disturbing me?
Look! Who's banging the door?
They don't even let us sleep.
Who's it?
Why do you disturb us in sleep?
- Is Sardar Khan inside?
- He's in jail.
- Make way.
- I said he's in jail.
Who's there? What's it?
This is my house and not a garden.
Where's Sardar Khan?
Why? Was he amongst
the 21 absconding?
Who else are there inside?
My kids. Come in the morning,
I'll introduce you.
- Make way.
- Hey. Move back.
I said...
come in the morning
like the decent people.
Otherwise, I'll gut you.
Get lost.
You go and sleep.
I'll deal with these pimps.
I've an effective
remedy for your illness.
Everyone is sleeping.
What's her name?
Durga!
Is she Hindu?!
Yes.
What happened?
What's this?
Why didn't you call me?
Open your fist. Open it.
Show me. Has your father given you?
- Open your fist.
- Why do you hit me?
What else do you expect?
Why don't you say anything?
What do I say?
I'mjust a servant.
I've served his father.
I've fed him.
Whatever he does is right...
because he is a man.
Then why don't you do the
right thing for yourself.
No...
Will you eat ice-cream?
Do get one for me.
Who is that?
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Where are you going? Wait!
Until I am alive,
you will never have to
pay for ice cream.
Next time, I'll get you another.
Who is that?
Uncle! can I see the movie?
Uncle! can I see the movie?
Qureshis ruled in Wasseypur
since Sultana Dacoits time
It was sultana at that time
Now it was Sultan
And Sultan's Butcher
Goons could do anything here
They kidnapped any woman
They had a free run
other muslims
were shit scared.
Qamar Makhdoomi
decided to fight for their rights
But Qureshis made a mockery of him.
Salaam!
Wassup! You don't
order home deliveries anymore?
Want to fuck Durga
all by yourself, eh?
I want to meet Sultan.
It's dog's meat, take it away.
Sultan is the son of
Sultana Dacoit's sister
whom Ehsan Qureshi
has brought up at his home.
He carved an entire
buffalo when he was 12
and carves 60 buffaloes
a day by himself.
That's why others
are scared of him.
Something needs to be done
about these Qureshis.
We tried to reason with them,
we requested them.
And did everything we could.
But they don't care.
Your name is still a terror there.
Everyone knew about
your dad's legendary
Now you just come back.
That house was empty
in neighbourhood
I bought it.
Now Sultan has occupied that house.
His goons gamble all day long there.
They booze up,
they kidnap women in night.
What do we do now?
Let's go!
Run!
Go to hell!
Let's go! Run!
How do I go to the college?
He stands there everyday
If I change the lane
he will stalk me somehow.
He looks at me like
he never saw a woman before.
It seems that he will eat me.
He is a henchman from Dhanbad.
If you will kill him in
Wasseypur then there is no problem.
He must be J.P. Singh's man
Now if we do something...
police will be after us.
Wassup big guy?
Piss off, asshole!
Son of a bitch!
You!
Hold him!
Stop!
Get lost!
Run!
Follow him.
Get in!
Run asshole!
Is he dead?
Not dead? Check him!
You motherfucker!
Sardar lived in Wasseypur
for one year after the jailbreak
He killed a henchman there.
J.P. Singh's henchman,
whom nobody had touched yet.
Wasseypur was muslim's area
And that man was Hindu.
He chopped his body and
threw it in the Slaughter house.
Qureshis had the contract
of the slaughter house...
and Qamar Makhdoomi was
not their favourite man...
That girl had nothing
to do with the Qureshis.
But the Qureshis
didn't say anything.
And their cheif,
Sultan, remained quite
Political Emergency was over
It was the 80's...
and Wasseypur had become
a part of Dhanbad
where Sardar was living two lives
One in a house in Wasseypur
where the Qureshis were his enemies
The second in a house in Dhanbad
where Ramadhir Singh was his enemy
There was only one advantage
of living in Wasseypur...
that the police never
came to this area.
- Get up.
- What the...
Are you new to this area?
Why did you come here?
This is Wasseypur. Understood?
Is there any drama going on?
Sardar Khan killed a henchman
in Dhanbad's market.
I heard the body parts are here.
When Sardar comes out of his hiding...
catch him. Alright?
This is Wasseypur.
Here a pigeon flies with one wing.
and protects his arse
with another wing.
Got it? Now piss off...
Hey, leave that finger here.
That's evidence!
Here it is.
Let's go. Bye!
So, how is it?
Are we good?
I want you to make me a pistol.
I have pipes from a cycle.
Cycle's pipe is weak,
the barrel will flower up...
- Will it?
- Yes.
- So what should I bring?
- Truck's steering pipe.
How much pipe I will have to bring?
What is the range?
It'll be enough.
- What would be the barrel life?
- Around 6 rounds...
From how much distance I can
shoot and man will die?
- 20 feet will do.
- Sure?
Qureshi!
Catch him!
Catch him!
Holy shit!
Catch him!
- Move!
- Hey, stop! Stop I say.
Catch him!
What is this piece of shit?
look at the fucking recoil.
Shoot someone in butcher market
and it hits someone in Calcutta.
Do you think I am a fuckwit?
Hey Badoor, wassup?
You son of a bitch, it didn't explode!
Stop!
Catch hold of the bastard!
Catch him!
Catch him!
Yes, that's right.
Run! Run for your life!
Throw!
Throw!
C'mon!
Who was that?
- What was that?
- Sardar Khan!
Everyone had gone to a mourning.
I was sleeping upstairs.
I wasn't feeling well today.
I heard a blast outside.
When I came out...
I see destruction everywhere...
What?
We should kill him.
Sardar had started to
take over Wasseypur.
He got so busy that
he almost forgot...
that his wife Nagma and
his sons were still alive...
Shall I turn off the light?
Let it be...
I will turn it off
Does he kick?
I felt it, too.
I think J.P. and his dad
have got cold feet now...
Not at all.
They are waiting.
Bhumihars are cunning like mongoose...
they like to strike with an ambush.
What happened?
Doctor has adviced against it.
Doctor doesn't know anything.
Like you know more than the doctor...
So what should I do then?
what you always do...
Get lost!
Good excuse!
Get pregnant and avoid your husband.
Like I wanted to do it
As if God left your child in my womb.
My mom didn't had 4 kids.
- Are you trying to compensate for that?
- I am not!
You really enjoy being pregnant.
You don't stay at home much...
always getting into troubles.
At least I keep busy with the kids.
- If I will bring another wife?
- What do you mean?
Like I didn't know
about your bengali chick.
Did you make her pregnant as well?
Why are you staring at me?
Drama.
I am leaving.
Give me the keys.
Wake him up.
Where are you going?
Sardar!
But, Sardar! Sardar!
- Who's it?
- It's me Sardar!
Where you have been?
She is in pain.
Okay. Let me see.
You stay here! I am coming.
Okay.
Durga!
What happened?
You are feeling pain.
Leave me! Leave me!
Leave me!
- My God!
- Leave me!
Leave me!
Enough!
Will you kill me?
What happened?
Leave me!
What happened?
I'm back.
- What happened?
- What you have done with me?
You wanted to treat
me for my illness.
You have tied me
here like an animal.
Why are you cursing me?
I don't want to be a
child making machine like your wife?
So who is making you?
So what is this?
This is love.
This is my love.
Faizal!
Salaam!
Where is your mom?
- She is unconscious!
- Is it boy or girl?
Boy!
So smile!
What's wrong? Do you need money?
Share it.
You don't want to meet mom?
Now she is unconscious
so what's the use?
Tell her that I came in new shirt.
I don't want to wear this.
- Shut up!
- I don't want to wear it.
Why?
I feel ashamed.
What will you do
by going to the school?
Your dad has stopped sending us money
Find a job and earn some money.
Faizal!
Tell me where are you going?
Who you are going to kill?
Whose house is this?
Shall I help?
What?
How much you got?
- 20 rupees.
- That's it.
You will give 10 rupees to me?
I will give all of it to mom.
Danish!
Did you recognize me?
- What?
- Ramadhir, I'm a state representative.
Come I will drop you home
When did your dad
come home last?
An year?
Or more?
He earns millions
and he spends his money
on that Bengali and her son.
You both are cleaning train
toilets instead of going school.
Don't you feel angry?
It's 1000 rupees. Keep it.
Keep it.
Tell your mom...
Ramadhir is with her.
Mom!
- Who gave you?
- Ramadhir Singh gave me
He said if you need more
money then come and get it.
He gave you and you keept it?
Are you a beggar? Is your dad dead?
Why dad doesn't come home?
Why he doesn't send money.
Now you want to kill him.
Will you kill him?
Will you make me a widow?
Wait, I'll show you.
Why did you take the money? So
what if your dad doesn't come home.
We get ration on time.
You are walking around with his respect.
- Rogue!
- What are you doing?
You take money
from Ramadhir Singh?
Move! Move, I said.
- I said stop.
- Move away.
I said move away.
Move away.
Move away.
Don't rub it!
I am not injured.
Don't rub it!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Faizal!
Faizal! Faizal!
Faizal!
Faizal! Stop my child.
Faizal!
Faizal didn't return
home that night.
That thing settled in
his mind to such an extent...
that his growth stopped.
Physical as well as mental.
He started withering.
He was younger than Danesh...
but looked elder.
Doctors and physicians lost hopes.
He also started taking drugs.
And he never talked about
that night with anyone.
Neither he said anything,
nor Nagma, nor did I.
Neither he nor I looked
into each other's eyes...
But he didn't know, what couldn't
happen between Nagma and myself...
that day, never happened in life.
Hide the bottles.
Why?
That's a hot chick passing by...
Brother! Take me at the crossroad.
Excuse me, will you come to Girdi?
No. I don't want to go. -
Few men were following her in jeep.
The jeep was from Hirapur.
They abducted the girl.
Must be Ramadhir's men.
At what time did they come?
That's enough...
Attention everyone!
A Carnival is necessary...
it's a festival, not a funeral.
A girl was abducted
from Wasseypur yesterday.
If the girl doesn't reach home
safely in the next 3 hours...
we'll smash this entire
area with grenades...
and we'll make representative
Ramadhir Singh's...
entire family do a
strip dance in public.
Attention everyone!
Salaam! Hit the music.
Let's go.
Close the door.
How much will you humiliate me?
Find out who's that bastard?
Who can't keep his dick in his pants?
Yes, father.
Sir, I have some work.
It's okay.
Take out the jeep.
- Sir, please get my file passed.
- Get lost.
Listen, excuse me.
- Are you from this locality?
- Yes.
Is any girl abducted
from around here?
Yes, she was Mr Khan's daughter.
A girl was abducted from Wasseypur.
Did you see any drunk
guys last night?
- Was it Mohsin?
- Mohsin?!
Wake up the motherfuckers!
Get up!
Are you mad?
Did you forget the what
happened to your henchman?
They were too drunk.
Will they abduct any girl...
walking on the road?
Send these bodies and
the girl with respect.
Okay.
What happened, uncle?
They sent only 2 dead bodies.
Actually they were four.
Open it.
- This way.
- Where are they hiding?
Where are they?
Here...
Oh, they're having a party.
I looked for you everywhere.
Who's is Muslim among you two?
He is.
Nice to meet you. Hello.
Come with me.
- Where?
- Come, I said.
Brother!
Brother!
- What?
- So much happened.
You're still here? Now go.
It's over.
The matter is over. C'mon.
Get up!

You'll spoil your health. Come.
Come here.

Watch carefully!
Watch carefully!
Watch carefully!
Here... look!
Chop his dick!
Chop his dick. Yes, look!
Can you see? See!
They chopped off
the body...
the body has disappered...
Didn't even leave a finger.
there is no evidence!
Father!
Your wedding, is fixed...
with Sabrina Khanam,
daughter of Sohail Khan...
with a gift of 100,000 rupees.
Do you accept this marriage?
- Yes, he does.
- He has to say that.
- C'mon! say that.
- I accept.
Do you accept?
I accept.
Salaam Mr. Representative. Priest fixed...

All the butchers...
of the butcher ghetto.
Ehsan Qureshi!
- Where?
- Inside.
Sir, Sultan is here.
Sit on the sofa.
No, I said sit on the sofa.
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.
I heard about
Wasseypur's incident.
Won't you eat food?
Yes, but look who has come.
Sultan! Did you recognize him?
Yes, you told me once.
- Greetings!
- Bless you!
Shall I set the china plates?
Yes, definitely. For all? Okay.
- How many dead?
- 12 of my men up till now.
He lobs grenades.
It's not a fair fight...
Sardar is nothing.
You didn't know his father.
He used to work for me.
Men used to piss their
pants at his sight.
Sardar is not even
an inch of his father.
Definitely.
We'll provide you the arms.
Gather your men.
They've got bombs.
We'll give you pistols.
Kill each one of them.
Find everyone of them
and shoot them in the ass.
- Here, take this.
- OK.
Can you do it?
Yes, sir.
- Get some automatic guns.
- You will get everything.
Learn something from him.
He doesn't have anything to do.
Just warming his chair.
Go and help your mom. Go!
Time had come that stealing
coal was a small business
Coal Labour themselves
were getting into it.
Big business was Contractorship.
Contracts for supply of timber...
or sealing unused
mines with river sand.
- It's written 32 trucks here.
- So 32 trucks are parked there
- Where?
- Look over there.
- That's only one,
- That's the 32nd truck...
I have to fill entire mine
Otherwise land will sink.
Let it sink.
How else will they start open cast mines.
Whoever dominated,
got the contracts.
Now we started stealing
sand near riverbank.
Sardar got the contract
to fill the mines with sand...
and became the lord of Wasseypur
After killing Qureshis
and blowing up their houses...
Sardar drove them
away from Wasseypur...
and started scrap iron
business with Asghar
Coal chapter had become
history for Dhanbad Mafia
A tender for old machines in the
paint factory is coming up.
Yes, I heard about it.
- Asghar!
- Yes.
My boy has grown up!
Come here.
- Salaam!
- Salaam!
Will you work with us?
Yes.
What say uncle, should we let him join us?
Go ahead. But where?
On a job or on the business?
Get aside.
C'mon, hurry up.
Hush!
Make a line and everyone
Will get money. C'mon.
Don't give money to anyone
who breaks the line.
Hey Danish!
How is your mom?
Fine!
Where is Faizal?
I want to ask you something.
What?
Come home, please!

Ramadhir couldn't harm me
But if his mom wants...
she can fry my liver
- Got it?
- Father!
Bring the gun.
Get the guns.
Bring the guns.
Why you didn't keep a gun here?

Idiot doctor! Stand up!
Get inside.
This is wrong!
Asghar, turn on the lights.

Will he die if he lies down by himself?
C'mon, lie down.
- What is this? Asghar, hold him.
- Remove the shirt!
Remove the shirt!
What happened?
- I think its a powercut.
So what? Operate on him.
I can't do anything in the dark.
Don't tell me that asshole!
So what if electricity is gone?
Operate on him.

Hey...
- See that car over there?
- Yes!
Chop it up.
- Alright.
Ali, Jameel, c'mon.
We are just chopping
up your car right now...
If something would have
happened to my son Danish...
I would have fired so many bullets
that your driver
would get rich just by
selling the bullet casings!
Are you enjoying it?
Are you enjoying it?
Asghar!
Smell him and tell us what
he had for breakfast?
- A thrashing from his wife!
- What?
This is not good.
Come here!
there is nothing
worth saying anymore...
What's the problem?
You live on one floor and
she will live on another floor.
If you want you can
have separate kitchens.
Durga!
Durga!
- Do you want your daddy?
- Yes!
Let's do one thing
Lets chop you from the middle.
I will have one leg... and
she will have another.
Give me one butt cheek...
And give her another.
Lets chop your dick in half as well.
You can pee from your mouth then.
Durga, listen to me.
Get lost from here
- You won't come.
- Never!
Fine!
I will come later
- Where is daddy?
- In hell...
Give your right to someone else...
Long live, Amitabh!
He is so hot!
Marry me!
Vijay! You set off
dynamite and walk off...
as if you're strolling
in a garden.
Aren't you afraid of dying?
One who has closely seen
his mother die everyday for 25 years...
why would he fear death?
Now Playing: Yash Chopra's Trishul
That tall actor really makes me crazy.
Let's watch the movie once again.
C'mon, let's go. Please.
Please.
We don't have money for tickets!
- Do I look ok?
- Yeah, like a pretty damsel.
Allow us to see one more show.
Please, let us in!
Please, let us in!
- I watch movies everyday. Can we?
- Tickets please.
No, we don't have tickets.
Please, can we?
Will you eat something, Faizal?
- Yes.
- Let us in please!
Come with me.
Why do you want
to go to your father?
As long as the villain lives...
he's everything.
We can't face real pistols
with garage made guns...
- What?
- Stop it.
Go out. let me work.
We are also talking business.
Do you have only this
place to sit and talk?
Go out and talk.
Stop it, Please!
Go out, please!
- Stop it.
- Go out!
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning.
What were you saying?
Not many people know you.
I'll give you an address.
Mr Yadav will meet you there.
He'll give you 6 guns for 200,000 rupees.
Real guns, but second hand.
Each one costs more than 150,000 rupees.
6 guns forjust 200,000 rupees.
Why is he giving it to us for peanuts?
Shall I go?
His wounds haven't healed yet.
And no one knows me either.
Yes, send him.
It's open.
46...47...
49...
- Hey...
- What?
- Where to?
- Home.
Where to?
What's the matter?
Answer me!
- Where's your home?
- Dhanbad.
How much luggage do you have?
One bag.
- Where's it?
- Below the seat.
- Pandey! Check his luggage.
- Yes.
What's this? Tell me.
Get up!
Are you traveling in the
train or a bloody armory!
I saw Fazlu and his
friends robbing a store.
Everyone has a pistol in hand.
Time has changed.
Everyone wants to be a bigshot.
Who kept this dish and bowl here?
Things were not like that in past.
Then, it was Ramadhir Singh on
one side, and I on another...
Can it cool a brain down?
Rather it freezes it...
if you have one...
Enough of this bloodshed.
Let's start another business.
Like?
Protection.
- What?
- Protection.
People respect me.
People won't refuse my protection.
Bengalis have shifted here in
large numbers, they eat fish, a lot.
I'll talk to few local fishermen...
of course lovingly.
To look for another business...
so that we can jump into it.
In that case there's a pond...
outside Wasseypur.
It belongs to the temple authority.
If you call them, they'll
give it up for you.
Why call them up?
Should we talk business on phone?
Nagma! You better lock yourself in the fridge.
I'll sell both of you.
You as well as the fridge.
Okay.
The fishes that you're catching here...
now belongs to us.
We've bought this pond.
Henceforth, if a single fish
is stolen from here...
we'll kill the culprit. Understood?
Salaam.
Salaam.
C'mon, give your share...
- Is it full?
- Count it.
She's Sultan's sister. Shama Parveen.
Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!
Uncle Badoor!
Why do you want to piss me off after a prayer?
Please listen to me!
Lets stop this fight amongst each other.
Your father started it.
Listen, uncle. Your grandpa drove away my
grandpa from this village.
We can't get to the root of this fight.
We have to unite someday.
What do you mean?
That our religion is same.
Even our occupation is same.
Let's co-operate and live.
What will one gain,by this bloodshed?
Will your father agree?
Open it!
Ali! Ali!
Open the door.
What's happening here?
Fuckers!
This is not right!
Open the door.
Have one!
Give him one.
This is wrong, uncle.
This deal will be bad for both of us.
Where are the fucking bullets?
He's taking a small piece.
- Won't you take some?
- Uncle!
- Are you feeling ashamed?
- Uncle! Uncle!
Next month, I'm getting married.
We're waiting for your release.
And you know what? We've,stopped
this bloodshed business.
We started dealing in fishes.
It's doing well.
Where are you staring at?
Listen, I'll come to pick
you up before marriage.
Understood?
I'll come on my own.
O Youth.
Poverty shakes up the weak relations.
Poverty shakes up the weak relations.
And even the strangers become,our well wishers
when we've money.
Not every friend is loyal.
Not every stone is shinning.
Many flowers blossom in the forest.
But not every flower is fragrant.
Salaam Mr Yadav? Please, come...
Did you get the bullets?
I met your old friend in the jail.
Last time when father sent me with money...
I didn't understand...
