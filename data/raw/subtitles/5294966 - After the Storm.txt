Now for a report on the latest typhoon
Please
The powerful typhoon, Number 23 is...
Number 23?
That's way too many typhoons for one year
I remember her name now
Janet, Janet Lynn
Oh, the blonde. With hair like this...
She fell on her butt,
but got a perfect score
Figiaskating makes no sense
It's pronounced, “figure“
This, Mr. Yanagida, did he work with Dad?
He was his boss, at the factory
Your father used to borrow money
from him all the time,
and I'd have to beg my big brother
for help
Well, thank goodness, those days are over
It was always up to me...
Sounds like you miss arguing with him
Not at all
I feel so liberated
You'll go senile, spending time alone.

New friends at my age only mean
more funerals
Right
The flavor sinks in to
the ingredients if you
cool it down slowly
and let it sit overnight
Just like people
Nicety put
I'll put some in Minori's lunchbox
tomorrow
What about dinner tonight?
I still have that leftover chicken
That's not enough.
Your husbands still young
Young? He's turning 50 this year
But he needs to “sit“a little longer
before his “flavor“sinks in
Look at that word,
it looks like it has slumped shoulders
I've always had bad handwriting.
I took after you
I'm not as bad as you
In that case, you address all these
But my hands won't move
They're moving just fine
Knock it off, you're not some comedian
But Dad sure had good handwriting
That was his only pride
Even when everyone started having their
New Year cards printed,
he kept grinding his own ink...
Right, right
Hey, did the Shibatas move?
Their son bought a house
in that housing development
Wow, I'm impressed
He was never bright in school
They say, “Great talents bloom late“
We have a “great talent,“
in our family, too
His height is surety great

What would you like?
Tempura soba, with eggs
Here's your side dish

AFTER THE STORM
Ryota?
How have you been? What brings you here?
I'm here sorting stuff out
after Dad's funeral
I heard. My condolences
Say, didn't you move out?
I moved back home
An elderly man died all alone last year
Realty?
Yes, realty. The one in apartment #5-3-5
No one knew for three weeks
That made me worry about my parents
You're a good daughter
You're the good son, Ryota
Yoshimi and I were saying
how you're the star of our class
NO---
Your folks must have been so proud
of your award
Hardly
My old man never read a single novel,
his whole life
Yoshimi, huh? I remember her
She's gained weight
A lean, elderly man, 170cm tall,
wearing silver-rimmed glasses...
has gone missing
He is wearing...
Shinoda
Anybody home? Coming in
Lottery Tickets
Pawn Tickets
He even pawned my stamp collection
Ryota? Is that you?
Oh, you're home
You should tell me when you're coming
Sorry
What now?
I wanted to find something of Dad's,
to remember him
Like what?
Look, I brought your favorite cake
You want money?
You've got powder on your chin
Say, whatever happened to that scroll?
The one Dad said would be appraised
at 3 mil yen on that antiques TV show
We never had that
Are you in trouble?
No, I'm not I got a bonus, too
How much?
Whatever
You're a bad liar
Unlike your father
Are you sure about that scroll?
It was in a box like this
I threw away all his things the day
after his funeral
What? You threw them away?
YES
Everything?
They only take up space
Are you serious?
I am
I can't believe it...
After 50 years together, realty?
50 years together is exactly why.
That's how it is.
That's deep Yes, it is
So, there's no Sesshu scroll...
It's so hot, today
Glad I wore short sleeves
See, I knew I had two of these left
Forget it, summer's over
But it's over 30 degrees today
Something's wrong
It's too frozen to eat
Buy some real ice cream. You get a pension
when I do, Chinatsu's kids eat it all up
You can't eat these so fast
So Sis comes here a lot?
Why?
I saw the rice cake on the altar
The discounted one
Whenever she wants me to
cook dinner for her
Be careful
Of what?
You never know what she's up to
There's nothing left around here to
sponge off of
This has that refrigerator smell
If you just shave off the top,
you can eat the bottom part
Classical music? Whose influence?
Ms. Nagaoka?
What do you care?
You used to love that nasty radio show
That's one thing, this is another
Get a better radio.
That looks like a robot
I can take this one into the bath
Waterproof?
Yes, I mail-ordered it It's perfect
Frozen solid?
Too little syrup
They deliver groceries now?
To residents above the third floor
That's so convenient
To compensate for the inconveniences
of old age
It's so quiet here
No more children playing these days
We used to fight over the fields,
just to play baseball
We threw balls onto the verandas of
the girls we liked
Remember this tangerine tree?
That's the one I planted from seeds
when I was in high school
It's grown so much
It doesn't flower or bear fruit,
but I water it everyday, like it's you
That's not a nice thing to say
But it feeds the caterpillars
The other day,
one of them turned into a butterfly
with a blue pattern...
I'll show you a picture, later
Don't bother
So it's useful for something
I'm useful for something, too
In that case, the typhoon's coming,
so please move the pots over to the wall
Sure thing
That's easy enough
Oh, dear
I definitely took care of that on Saturday
I'll go back to the bank tomorrow
and ask them
Knock, knock
No, I'm not lying
I really... Hello? Hello?
Knock, knock
Yeah, what?
What is it?
I'll make coffee, let's eat that cake
Oh, sure
What were you doing?
What? Nothing
Why lock it then? What was the call about?
The new guy at the office is so useless...
It must be tough, eavesdropping
and sneaking into homes
I saw it on TV
We're not cops, so it's easy
Don't risk your life.
You're my only son, after all
I'll be fine
I'm just conducting research for my novel
Fine, then...
But I can't even tell my big brother
what you realty do...
I know...
Staying for dinner?
I wasn't expecting you,
so I only have noodles...
I better get going
Oh, please don't go
You sound like you're about to die
Is it work?
Yeah, I'm in charge, after all
One for you
What's that?
Spending money.
Buy yourself some classical CDs
It's OK. I've got my pension.
I get by just fine
Come on, take it. Let me do this, for once
Are you sure? In that case, I accept
While you're at it, buy me a condo.
The Shibatas moved out of their 3 bedroom
Don't push it
I know you can't afford it
I'm the “Great talents bloom late“ type
You're taking too long to bloom
Hurry up or I'll haunt you...
Stop it
That 3 bedroom You don't need it
Thanks for helping
Climbing up and down four flights of steps
makes me wheeze
I'll open it
But today's not the day
for paper recycling
Don't worry, no one's looking
Yes they were... Staring at me
Oh, Mr. Niida
Oh, hello
This is my son, the novelist
Oh yes, hello
How do you do
I've been taking classes from him
Thank you
I read your book... “No One Home...“
The Empty Table Yes, yes, Table
Is that based on a true story
from your life?
No, it's fictional
Oh, I see
The depiction of the older sister
was so realistic
And her fights with her mother-in-law
Thanks, you're too kind
He always had good grades
in Japanese language class
Genius is apparent at an early age.
You have real flair
See you on Wednesday, then
We'll cover Beethoven
Yes, Opus 131
So, that's what that CD was about
It's just a small group
I'm just preparing
Where does he live?
Number 2-2-6
I figured. One of the upscale condos
His family? He's married, right?
Apparently, she passed away,
three years ago
Why?
There were women's clothes
in the dry cleaning he was carrying
They must be his daughter's
You detectives don't miss a thing, do you?
No, you're wrong
The eagle eyes of a novelist
When I was walking here the other day,
a butterfly kept following me
The blue one?
I thought it must be your dad
I said, “Is that you?“
And it landed right there
So I told him,
“Fm perfectly happy without You, “
so don't come for me for a long time
And it fluttered away
I expected a better ending
Too bad
Why is the slide in the park
all fenced up?
A child fell, and the community board
fenced it up
Isn't that silly?
It was the clumsy child's fault
Right
Do you get to see Shingo sometimes?
Yeah. He started playing baseball
Baseball? That boy?
I'm thinking I'll buy him
a baseball glove...
Is Kyoko well?
She's the same
Busy with her job
A woman with her own career...
It doesn't always work...
They aren't broken, are they?
They're in good shape
I can offer 3000 yen, no more
Fine, I'll take that
Say, aren't you Mr. Shinoda's...?
Yes, I'm his son
I knew it
Father seems to have been here a lot
One time, he gave me such a hard time
He said he was desperate for money to pay
for his son's surgery,
and brought in a tattered scroll
surgery?
Yeah, he said you had a tumor
I've never been hospitalized
Right? That's what I figured
Hey Dear!
That scroll... Was it a Sesshu?
Yes, it was
But it was only a print
A Print?
Only the box was authentic
He even demanded money to
celebrate your recovery
He was out of control
Dear?
I guess she stepped out
We're having so many typhoons, this year
“Wanna?
Yes, there's another one coming
Sorry, the parking lot was far
I ordered your coffee Thank you
Did you already...?
Not yet
There's never an excuse for
being in a love hotel
You husband will use this evidence
to get a good divorce settlement,
so he doesn't have to pay you alimony
What a stingy jerk
It happens a lot
Your coffee
Why did my life turn out like this?
But why are you showing me this?
Of course we could just deliver it
to our client,
but if you prefer not...
Of course I prefer not
We could simply disappear the evidence
You can make it disappear?
YES
Just between us
For how much?
We have to deliver our client something,
so we'll give him a fake,
like this... You were at a planning meeting
Fine, I'm in. Sounds like fun
Thank you
Listen, as long we're here,
can I hire you for another job?
At your service
For an additional fee
You didn't deposit the money?
What is this area known for...?
Oh no, not now
I can't be in this sacred place
and not stop by
I'm sick of going to loan sharks for you
I'll double this and pay my rent,
and buy a glove too, a Mizuno
Didn't you buy it with
the cash I lent you?
Things happened, I spent it
What about the scroll?
It wasn't there?
I wish life were that easy
I told you it was too good to be true
Hold it, Yoshida, not yet!
Now go! Make a move!
Catch 'em, you fool!
Let's go
Cmon
He was supposed to be hot! What the hell!
What a joke. He was pathetic
Don't be a pussy, Yoshida
You gotta go for it!
What? 10,000 yen
Fine, 5,000
We agreed before, that was it
Those bikes don't come with brakes
How I can I put on the brakes,
when they can't?
You're not making sense
I'll double it
The boss will chew you out if you don't
write up that report
It's bullshit anyway, you do it
Going for a trifecta
Yamabe Detective Agency
We had to chase him around, in the river,
wearing rubber boots
Right?
We stank for days
Thank you so much for finding her
No more running away, OK?
When I hear those clanging bells,
I just feel so alive
We only have chunky chili oil
This one might be old
Stock up on yuzu peppers like
at that ramen shop
Get it yourself. This isn't a cafeteria
Manami
Don't you feel that way
about something else?
I mean, you're only gambling
How can it make you feel alive?
You just alienated all 60 million
bike racing fans in Japan
There aren't that many fans
Not everybody loves dogs
Manami, get me a wet towel
That's an impressive fruit basket
She doesn't even know
I padded her bill by 10 days
What's going on with your case?
What's going on?
No sign of an affair yet
And the ex-boyfriend
the husband suspected?
We looked into him, but nothing.
The husband probably imagined it
He can't even trust his own wife
I think every year,
men are becoming less manly
It's true, all the stalkers these days
are men
You're right
But we make a living off guys like that
We'd better thank the times,
this petty age we live in
Ohtani Real Estate
Why did my life turn out like this?
The Empty Table
Rvota?
It's me, Machida
Tell me it's you, before you knock.
You gave me a heart attack
What did you think I was here to collect?
Your gas bill? Electricity?
Could be any
It rained?
In the morning
Good thing it cleared up
That little pitcher can throw
You can do it, Shingo!
Look at them,
already sitting together like that
Yamanouchi Real Estate is a huge company
He makes 15 million yen a year
Probably from sleazy speculation deals
The pitcher's scared of you!
Think those two have already done it?
I'm asking you
The high school he went to
excels in baseball
They beat our team my first year
Strike three!
You gotta swing at it! Swing!
Don't worry
He was trying to draw a walk
Oops, her boyfriend already bought him
a glove
A Mizuno...
Go for it
Again
Yes! Now it's your turn
My turn?
Okay, watch me
Swing with your hips
Go for it
Watch my hips
Wow! Yeah!
As pinch hitter, you have to swing the bat
You can't lose that chance
You'll try harder next time, right?
I was trying to draw a walk
You can't be a hero if you get on base
like that
I don't need to be a hero
You don't?
Your table's ready, sir
Shall we?
Who's your hero?
Who do you respect, Shingo?
Grandma
She's very wise
Alas, you can't list a relative as the person
you respect on those entrance exams
Oh, realty?
Bathroom?
You know where it is?
I'm fine
You two visit his grandma often?
Yes, sometimes
Do you still have to?
No, but Shingds so fond of her
Look at you,
you've gotten bigger down there
What are you doing here?
Is that your mom's new boyfriend?
Yeah...
What's he like?
He has a loud voice
That must be embarrassing Yeah
Is she marrying him?
I don't know...
Ask her, soon
I have to go
Okay, see you on Sunday
Do you have the money?
No problem, don't you worry
It's not good for Shingo, either
I'm sorry to be so blunt,
but he shouldn't spend time with
such an untrustworthy man
But he used to be a novelist,
it's just that right now, he's...
I read his award-winning novel.
Got it on Amazon
Realty? What did you think?
I won't say it was a waste of my time,
but I just didn't get what
he was trying to say
I don't suppose you would
You think so, too?
I thought so
He touched his head
He's laughing
He sure is
Get lost
Weren't you better off not knowing
about the other guy?
Why did she have to choose a guy
like that?
I'm sorry, I asked you here and
now I made you wait
I just got here
Thanks for that steak dinner,
even though I was of no help
The steak was too fatty
No, it was delicious
Listen, I'm wondering if you'd like to
write the story for a manga
A manga?
The rising star manga artist, Ishijima,
has been hired to illustrate
a manga series about gambling for our
Comic Punch series
He asked me to introduce him
to a gambling expert
Sure, I'm a gambling expert...
What do you think? We could pay you well
Would my name be on it?
If you don't want your name on it,
use a pen name,
so it won't harm your career
Actually, I'm in a rush to finish
my new novel
Hasn't your colleague told you?
Oh, I see
In that case,
I'd rather read your new work
Sorry for losing faith in you
Damaged rice cakes: 50 yen each
Thank you
Thank you
Hey, did you read my e-mail?
You said you wouldn't do this
I know, but I realty feel like
I can write again
I'm ready quit the detective agency
Don't you dare write about us again
You're invading our privacy
My freedom of expression
Listen to me, our family memories
aren't your private property
Why don't you just give UP?
It's been 15 years since you won that
Shimada Shinsuke Award
You said that on purpose, Sis.
It was the Shimao Toshio Award
Not even close
I'd remember it right,
if you'd won that famous award
Why did you give Mom money when
you're broke?
She was so excited, she called to tell me
But now you want to borrow money from me?
I don't want her to worry over money
Given what Dad put her through
Dad came here, too
One month before he died
He stood there, just like you,
“Please loan me some money“
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
You hate being likened to Dad
I do, but my situation is different
No, it is not
You're exactly like Dad
If Dad had worked hard all his life,
Mom would have moved out of that
housing complex years ago
Probably
She'd be living in a huge house
in a fancy neighborhood
That's right, her long, unfulfilled dream
When we lived in Nerima,
Mom used to roll up the bank passbook
and seal
in her stocking and hide it
at the bottom of the rice jar
But Dad found them and dug them up anyway
There were grains of rice
on the kitchen floor
Mom flew into such a panic
And after she got rid of the rice jar?
The space above the closet
With his bad legs,
Dad couldn't reach that high
what?
Right, right
Right, right
Of all his music, Beethoven was
most satisfied with this one
Upon hearing this composition,
Schubert is said to have reflected,
After this, what music can we write?
I saw that scene in a film, right?
With that actor who died,
Hoffman something or other...
I don't watch films...
Sir, didn't Beethoven write this the year
before he died?
That's right, he was 56
In today's world,
he'd be considered elderly, like us
When he was writing this...
His daughter...
Oh, she plays the violin
Apparently, she quit
We're still too far young to be elderly
I feel younger already
I wish there was a program
like this on television
I'd watch it every week
When I was younger, I did get an offer,
from the education channel
Wow, how amazing
But I thought that would be
disrespectful to the gods of music,
so I turned them down
What a shame
But we're thrilled to have you all
to ourselves
See you next time
See you next week
There's no way a guy like that
can make Noriko happy
We'll start investigating tomorrow
Please, I'm depending on you
We'll be in touch
Machida, do you want to work
this case alone?
Go for it, young man
It's a standard background check
If you need help, take Manami
Fantastic
You're on a job, man
They're already divorced.
She should be able to date whoever she wants to
Why envy the future?
There's a guy like him, sitting here
What are you talking about?
I'm not jealous
Realty? What is it, then?
Responsibility
No, you're still besotted with her
Do you even know what “besotted“means?
I do
How do you write it?
It's written like this...
One line too many No, it's not
You see, men only realize they're in love
after they've lost their beloved
Shinoda here,
probably hugs his ex-wife's picture
and cries himself to sleep
Maybe you do, too, Boss
One for each ex-wife
I'd rather hug you, Manami...
No thanks
Why am I out looking for a lost cat?
You loved them that much?
Of course, they're my family
what?
But you never even mentioned them
before you got divorced
That's not true
Let it go. If she remarries him,
you won't have to pay child support
But then,
I won't be able to see my son anymore
when he wants to see you,
he'll come to you
He will?
YES
No matter who stops him
You saw yours?
Yes, when I turned 20
I can't wait that long
He's dating his tutor?
Pro bably
I took this high school's entrance exam
I didn't pass
Still pissed?
What did you want to be, in high school?
I forgot
Ask me
How about you?
A public servant
So conventional
I didn't want to turn out like Dad
Life is complicated
Hey, that must be him
what?
To see my son, I'll cross any tightrope
It's “Any bridge“
Any bridge...
A bridge is a kind of tightrope
If you say so
I'm not forcing you to stay
I can do this alone
I'm in
I OWE YOU ONE
You owe me? What?
It's no big deal if you don't remember
Here
Don't play with fire, Kid
I'm not playing with her
She's playing with you
Whatever happens,
I'll never grown into a man like you
Listen, it's not that easy growing up
to be the man you want to be
You just sponge off your folks
Flower Shop
A bouquet, of red and pink flowers
He's not going on any business trip
She probably won't like it,
but his wife was right to suspect him
But she won't be sad, either
You never know
They've left the shop,
walking to the hotel now
Just follow them in, if you can...
Don't worry, you look like a professional
That's a compliment
Hi there, it's me, Sumire.
I'm in the lobby now
The other day, you said,
“Don't envy the future“
Yes?
Don't most girls
delete the past,
once they start a new relationship?
Is this about your ex?
No, no, just in general
You know what I think...
Using painting as a metaphor,
girls paint in oil rather than watercolors
New oil paint covers up the old painting,
even though it's still there
So, it never goes away
Of course not
It's not like replacing data
Right
Such awful taste... And those pathetic roses
Look at him grinning like that
You made a fortune because of me, right?
You can make it all back from your husband
And more, thanks to these
Do you wish you hadn't found out?
Not at all
For better or worse,
it's all part of my life
See you, thanks
Watch your step
No gambling it away this time
I know that
This will pay for child support
and his cleats
Not enough for rent
Can you believe it? She was a friend
who had attended her wedding
That's awful
Under her very nose...
I know a girl who stole
her friends boyfriend
What's with you two?
Something happen last night?
I am single, for now
Good morning
Isn't today your day off?
That was the plan, but...
That typhoon is definitely on its way
Typhoon #24 is going to land
on Kyushu today
Hey, Shinoda
You've gotten used to this work
Why don't you forget
researching your novel
and make this your fulltime job?
I'm just here for my writing...
Let me read it. What's it about?
Is the detective the lead character?
It's not like that
Is it about a realty bad detective
who shakes down high school kids
for money?
That high school kid is my boss's son,
from my days as a cop
Are you trying to ruin my agency?
That's not my intention...
Is it because
I didn't pay you a summer bonus?
Yes, no, well...
You want to see your son that badly?
Of course, I am his father
You, a father?
Hand me the envelope
How much did you take off of him?
30,000 yen
There's more in here
I stopped by the racetrack...
Listen, stop seeing your son
It takes real guts to accept that
you're not in their lives anymore
Got that?
Good thing you set aside 30,000 yen
Right
Are we still a bit short?
Right
You know, Ryota,
I still have the baseball glove my dad
bought me when I was nine
So...
Use these
to buy him cleats or a bat
Right...
But stop being so nice to me...
You'll make me cry
A used book fair
We used to come to these together
Why are you always late?
I had a meeting with my publisher
On a Sunday?
Always working...
Where's my 100,000 yen?
I got back late last night and
couldn't get to an ATM
And the bank's closed today
I couldn't find Dad's book
You should have just told me.
Let's go, Shingo
I look forward to our monthly visit.
Don't cancel it over a minor detail
A minor detail? That's what you agreed to
You know I'll pay
When?
Later today
5PM sharp, here, you pay in full.
And don't be late
Can't we all have tea together?
I have to go to work.
I'm always working, too
See you later
Later
I'd like these
Don't hold back
I'll buy you the Mizuno
You sure?
You bet
You're a size 3.5?
Wait here, OK?
Excuse me May I help you?
I want this, but it's soiled here
I'll check the stockroom for another pair
That pair is fine,
but can I get a discount?
So, what did you ask her?
Do you like him?
And she said?
Yes, I do
Go on
You don't want me to date another man?
Thanks for waiting, here's your burger
Enjoy
Where's yours?
I'm not hungry
And what did you say?
If you realty like him, it's OK
That's when you have to say,
“No,“loud and clear
And?
Do you like him or Dad better?
What did she say?
That's so long ago, I forgot
Want to buy a lottery ticket?
Mom will get mad
Don't worry
Let's buy one to remember
what?
To remember our...
bond
Hello, sir
You pick
I can? Sure
Your grandpa and I bought tickets
starting in kindergarten
But I'm paying for the ticket,
so we split the winnings, deal?
Sting?'
Don't talk to your father like that
There are two kinds of tickets
Singles are more fun to check
if you've won
I'm getting singles. How about you?
Let me see...
Thank you, please enjoy
Hello, it's me
What are you talking about?
I'm not Dad's ghost
Can I come over now? Shingds with me
He has something
he wants to show his grandma
He» S c or“. lng.)
With the typhoon approaching?
He's bringing Shingo along
This feels great
Right? My co-workers love it
Be careful Of what?
He's up to something
He never used to visit,
not even on New Years
Maybe he wants help
Financially, you mean?
No, with his ex-wife
It's too late for that
People give up so easily these days
I think she put up with a lot
A decently educated woman,
can support herself
I think that's great
Can't they get back together?
I think this will hold for now
Oh, thank you
Thank you so much for your help
He likes helping out like this
She's right
The truth is, this is what
I wanted to do for a living
Don't do it
Do what?
Don't take them out to sushi
Why not? We're friendly
I don't think Kyoko likes it
If you do, take them where the sushi isn't
served on a conveyor belt
That's where I took abacus lessons
Hey, the Chinese restaurant is gone
Next stop, Housing Complex Center
Stopping next
One time, I snuck inside that thing to
eat snacks during a typhoon
With your grandpa, late at night
Wasn't it dark?
We had flashlights
Did you get into trouble?
With whom?
With your mom
Your grandma?
We snuck out and snuck back in
Once, my friends and I climbed all the way
to the top of that tower
One of them got too scared
to climb back down
Why did you climb it?
Because, it's the symbol of
this housing complex
That's weird
It's not weird. Don't you do that stuff?
NO
What are you doing here?
Have I ruined your plan?
I didn't say that
We came to fix the glass door you broke
The perfect daughter
I work extra hard, doing your part, too
Look who's talking
Can't you cook dinner for your family?
Stay out of it
Grandma, sweeten mine
What now?
She wants something to drink
Why can't you drink plain water?
I'm going to take figure skating lessons.
Grandma's paying for them
That's great, you must be thrilled
That explains it
Explains what?
Figia skating? Who's princess is she?
It's pronounced Figure
So, we commoners can't skate?
Not by paying for it with
your mother's pension, poor Mom
And who was the kid who used to take
very expensive violin lessons?
Don't you take advantage,
of me or Mom
We're going home when you're done
Staying over?
I'm going home
What about Shingo?
Kyoko said she'd pick him up. I called her
Kyokds coming?
Let's stick around a little longer
Stop grinning like that.
She's your sister-in-law
Exsister-in-law
Hey, now
We're going home. The typhoon's coming
You want to see my “ex-wife“that much?
Kyoko, how have you been?
Oh, hello
The typhoon's coming, better hurry
Thanks, I will
Good luck with your entrance exams
I'm going for a private school
Don't be silly
I'm gonna be a figure skater,
pronounced “ur“
See you
I'm sorry, Mother,
this wasn't the original plan
Don't be. The more the merrier
Hi Mom That was fast
Don't wear shoes inside the house
Take them off, you're scratching the floor
They're cleats, not shoes
The floor's been scratched for years,
just like me
I'm so sorry
Come inside, Kyoko
You're soaked! I'll get you a towel
Don't make me worry like this
Shingo insisted on coming
Blaming your son
Come inside, both of you
Just for a bit, then
Don't cut your fingers
You're doing a great job
Throw in some green peas too, for color
I know, I know
He loves his peas
Are you the fifth shortest
in your class now?
Third shortest
Your dad didn't start growing
like that until Junior High
You're 146 centimeters now?

Let me see your legs
Look, he's got firm knees
He's not a dog. You can't tell that way
It's true for all animals
See? You'll be taller
You will, you will, you will
Three times, sounds like a lie
She made a kimono for me,
sewing it herself,
and everyone is thrilled when I wear it,
which makes me happy
But it is a little embarrassing,
when they say I look adorable in it
I'm so happy that you do
so many things for me,
but working so hard,
I'm sure you get tired, so please rest
Please keep living for a long time,
Grandma
You realty wanted to read it
out loud to her, right?
That makes me so happy
But if you're going to respect someone,
you should pick someone like Mother Teresa
or some astronaut
This one, there
Beautiful, you can still find these?
There's still a lot of greenery
around here
Amazing
That one, was on my tangerine...
Your tangerine?
It was on the leaves,
the caterpillar... How old was Shingo?
About three, I think...
A larva...
Oh, three...
Is that strawberry field gone?
Yes, they built a house over it, last year
If I'd known,
I would have visited it more often
Seconds?
Yes, please
You were realty hungry
I haven't tasted it in a long time.
It's great
Shingo, you have seconds, too
Seconds?
Even as a child he always loved my food,
whatever I cooked
That was his only virtue
What do you mean, “My only?“
The curry flavor infuses everything
Right? I use fish broth for the soup
His father loved this, so I made a lot
and kept it in the freezer
what?
This is six months old?
Oh, don't make such a fuss.
Besides, it's too late now
Men pay too much attention to
expiration dates
Of course we do
You do too, right, Shingo?
Look, there's curry on your shirt
Hey, did you just lick that cloth?
That's disgusting
Who are you calling disgusting?
I can do it myself
I've wiped your poo and pee
Oh, m';
He may be a grown man, but he still needs
someone to take care of him
Is it gone?
Please spend the night
You're leaving Grandma all alone
in this storm?
There she goes again,
like she's on her deathbed
I have extra futons and
I just washed the sheets
But Shingo has school...
The schools will close
But if he has to go to school,
he can leave early tomorrow morning
I didn't bring a change of clothes...
Oh, I see
It's a 30 minute wait for a taxi
If you get home that late,
Shingo will get to bed too late.
It's not good for him
OK, then... Great, I'll heat the bath
No taxi, then
Shingo needs pajamas
Can you still fit into your pajamas
from two years ago...
She comes right back to life
Incredible...
See, your father was also wrote well,
even as a child
Maybe you've got flair, too
What's flair?
Don't make a face, it's nothing bad
It's not?
That's right
It's a wonderful talent
Not everyone has it
You don't want to be like your father?
NO
Why not?
Mom left Dad because
she didn't like him, right?
They got married because
they loved each other
That's why you were born, Shingo
Do you think Dad likes us?
You know he does
If we win the lottery,
could we all live together again?
Well, maybe. Maybe you can
If we do, let's build a big house
so you can move in and live with us
Your invitation makes me so happy
Please, do make that happen
Hey, Mom, let's play a game
At this hour?
Yeah, Game of Life
OK,
but only one round
Thirteen, fourteen...
who won?
I did
Good job
The bathtub here is too small.
I hadn't been in it in awhile
A bath, Shingo?
Can't decide
Take a bath, it'll feel great
Mom, you need to clean the drain
There were dust fluffs in the bath
Oh, those dust bunnies?
Dust bunnies in the bath?
Sure... Only in the bathwater
Who's winning?
Let me play, too
The three of us, then
I'll sit out this round.
You two go right ahead
In that case, I'll go take a bath.
I want to see the dust bunnies
Good, go take a bath
If the water's too hot,
right is cold, left is hot
I know
Shall we play a round?
Not a chance. Playing Game of Life
with you is like a bad joke
Are you mad?
What did you and Shingo do, today?
I bought him cleats,
we ate burgers
Not McDonald's, the better place
What else?
Please don't drag him into
that “hobby“ of yours
What harm is a lottery ticket?
I want raise Shingo to work hard
Not make money gambling...
The lottery...
The lottery isn't gambling
Of course it is
No, it is not
What is it, then?
It's a dream
A dream you buy for 300 yen
That's gambling
You just alienated all 60 million
lottery fans in Japan
I'm happy to alienate them all
Say, Mom...
Mom, that's not...
This was your fathers futon,
but I had it cleaned, so it doesn't stink
That's not what I mean
We're not like that anymore
Please don't
Shingo can sleep between you two
A rare family reunion
He's got real talent
It's rare for a child in grade school
to structure an essay like that
You think so...?
You should give him lots to read
Like what?
For instance, books by E.T. Seton
and Jean-Henri Fabre...
And “Doctor Dolittle“
I'll send him a selection of books
Thank you
Well,
that's all I can do, now
Are you writing?
Me?
You know, these days,
literature is out of fashion
It's all “light“ “pop“ fiction
Same old complaint
Speaking of which,
I got an offer to write the story for
a manga series
I'm thinking I should give it a try
I kept trying to tell you to do that,
but you never listened
If I take that job, I'll be able to
pay monthly child support
You don't have to work so hard
just to visit him
I realty want to see him
I'm taking responsibility as his father
Taking responsibilityis acting like
his father once a month?
Wait a minute, don't call it “acting“
That's all it is
Well...
I'm happy to see him every week
You know you can't
If you're that interested in
being a good father,
why didn't you try harder before?
You're right
We're divorced now
But it's not over
what?
I'm always going to be Shingds father
Whatever happens between us,
as his parents
Wait
You're already in a new relationship?
Well, yes...
Oh...
Realty?
Another man?
Why?
Did Shingo say something?
So it's true
Have you...
Already...
Done it?
Don't talk about it here
Have you?
YES
You have...
So, you have...
Of course we have, we're not teenagers
Are you going to marry him?
I don't know yet
You did it before you decided?
Can't you wait?
I can't decide before I sleep with him
What are you talking...
Don't talk so loud
Why did you have to choose that guy?
Did you say that 90V?
You already know?
Know what?
You saw him with me?
Who? Where?
Oh, right, right, right
You're Mr. Detective, of course.
How can you stoop so low...
Are you, going to have kids?
Yes, we might
That's why you're in such a rush
I am not in a rush. Don't be so mean
You're so calculating
No, it's called “planning your life“
Well, it's not love
Grownups can't live on love alone
Hey, what are you doing?
We're both adults, why not?
Adults... Your mother's right there
If Mom wasn't here, it's OK?
Mom's trying to bring us back...
Wait...
Are you two in on this scheme?
You set this up from the beginning?
It wasn't like that.
Don't make it sound crude
Mom, which one's my toothbrush?
I'll be right there
It's OK, I'll go
More importantly, where's my 100,000 yen?
I'll pay
I'll pay, I'll pay
You said it three times
You always visit him and never pay.
This is your last visit
Your towel, Shingo
Thank you, Mother
Happy to
Dry off, Shingo
Glad I bought some big towels
Too bad! - Your sister
Latest typhoon news
You're still up?
As you get older, you fall asleep
but not for long
Ask your doctor for sleeping pills
I have, and he prescribes sleeping pills
now and then
That wind is fierce
Something just flew by
They said it'll blow over by morning
I love typhoons
They're so refreshing
You're strange
when we lived in that house in Nerima,
every time a typhoon came,
I worried it would tear the roof off
At night, we packed up our things
and took shelter in the church
at the kindergarten
Right, right
I only ever saw the church during the day,
so the stained glass looked
extra beautiful
When we moved in here,
I was so relieved I wouldn't have to
be afraid of typhoons anymore,
but I never imagined I'd wind up
living here 40 years
I'm sorry I'm such a useless son
I am going to die
What? Don't talk like that, it's bad luck
Luck has nothing to do with it,
I will definitely die someday
And probably right here
what?
Are you sick again?
No, I'm not
Listen, as I grow weaker and weaker,
I'm going to need you by my side,
taking care of me
That's not for me
They say that it's easiest for the dying
and for those left behind,
if you die in your sleep
But that's not true
It isn't?
That's how your father died
But he shows up in my dreams
You have dreams like that?
Every once in awhile
What do you dream?
He's always alive
I feel like he's still alive, too
which is better?
To have me bedridden for years
and unable to die,
or to have me die quickly but keep
appearing in your dreams?
Neither
Oh, no, you have to choose
Which is it?
Bedridden, then
Your “Final
“Swem
That's such an old show...
Yes, my final answer
The singer Teresa Teng is known
by her fans
for her songs, “Atonement“ and “Beloved“
But my personal favorite “Wakare no Yokan“
I wonder what Dad...
Realty wanted
From what?
From his life
I never could figure him out,
to his final day
His life didn't work out like he wanted...
So many things,
because of the times
He blamed all his weaknesses
on the times we lived in
Why are you so grave?
Do you think that incense is your dad?
Missing him after
he's gone will not bring him back
You have to deal with people
while they're alive
I know that
I wonder why it is that men
can't love the present
Either they just keep chasing whatever
it is they've lost,
or they keep dreaming beyond their reach
How can you enjoy life if
you keep doing that?
If you say so
You can't find happiness,
until you've let go of something
Deeper, even than the sea.
Bluer, even than the sky...
I've never loved anyone deeper
than the sea,
even though I've made it to this age
Don't sound so depressing
Have you?
Me?
In my own way...
No, not most people
But we still live our lives,
enjoying every day
Actually, we keep on living
because we haven't...
So, we manage to find joy,
day after day
That's complex
No, it's simple
Life is simple
I just said something realty deep,
didn't I?
You can use it in your next novel
Write it down, or you'll forget it
It's okay
Where's the notepad?
I remember it
which part?
You can't find happiness...
The typhoon's still around?
Yeah
It's intense
The toilet? The light switch is
the middle one, on the right
I know
Shall we go?
To the water tower?
No, the park
Rice crackers, cookies, candies...
A feast. We'll get drinks there
They're not climbing up the tower,
are they?
I think they're going to the park.
They mentioned the slides
They'll be fine, then
I'm sorry to ask you, at this hour
I'm wide awake, anyway
Would you like a snack?
No, I'm fine
I'll make some coffee,
then I just hope you aren't picky
It's late, I'm realty fine
You're right
You have such beautiful handwriting.
I envy you
You're too kind
Your mother had good handwriting, too?
Yes, she was a calligraphy teacher
If I had been a little smarter,
I wanted to be a home economics teacher
I studied teaching, too
What a coincidence. What subject?
Language. I even practiced teaching
You make me nervous,
staring at me like that
I just wonder...
If the two of you are completely over...
You treat me like your own daughter
and I realty appreciate that
But Ryota isn't cut out to have a family
I hoped having a baby would change him
In that sense,
he turned out just like his father
I'm sorry
No, I owe you the apology
The subject is closed
So, no more sushi parties
No, let's have another one
Can we?
Let's go to a sushi place where
they don't serve it on a conveyer belt
Yes, next time it's my treat
That makes me so happy
This...
His umbilical cord

Shingo I kept it after we took
him on his first shrine visit
You're right
From now on, you should keep it
I will
I realty, just can't...
understand why things turned out like this
And look at his terrible handwriting
We should have asked his father
to write it
He only inherited my bad handwriting
Something just flew
A plastic bag?
An umbrella
Someone's there
Realty?
Just kidding
Shoot
Time for a snack?
YES
A little stale
But still tasty
Shingo, do you remember your Grandpa?
Yeah, he was nice to me
But you didn't like him, right?
Why?
That's what Grandpa told me
That's not true
It's just that...
We had a fight
Why?
Because...
Probably because I became a novelist
What do you want to be when you grow up,
Shingo?
A public servant
Not a professional baseball player?
I could never be that
Why not?
You don't know if you don't try
I'm sure
What did you want to be?
Are you who you wanted to be?
I'm not,
who I want to be, yet
But you know,
it doesn't matter whether
I've become what I wanted
What matters,
is to live my life trying to become
what I want to be
Is that true?
It's true
It's true, it's true
It's true
Shingo, are you in there!?
It's Mom
What are you doing?
Come on in, Mom. You'll be dry in here
Come on in
My favorite umbrella, ruined
Let's go back, Grandma's worried
So soon?
This isn't how it was supposed to turn out
That's right
We were supposed to go right home
That's not what I'm talking about
It's realty true
This isn't how it was supposed to turn out
Don't fall
I already made up my mind
Let us move on
Do you understand?
I understand
I always understood
Coffee at this hour will
keep you up all night
I won't sleep anyway
That's not good for you.
You're still a child
Not fair
Sometimes I'm a kid,
sometimes I'm a grownup
when did I say you're a grownup?
The other day, you told me,
You're not a child anymore.
Pretend to enjoy yourself
After your date
That's confusing, isn't it?
You, shut up
Did you have to bring that up now?
What's wrong?
I can't find my lottery tickets
Maybe I dropped them
Oh, just forget about them
They're for 300 million yen
Cut it out! You're not going to win,
anyway!
Silly you. You always win at least 300 yen
What? Realty?
Find them?
Found one!
How many, Shingo?
Two
Two down
Kyoko? Found one
Four more!
...Typhoon #24 has headed north,
and is now over Hokkaido...
More than 120 people
were injured across the nation,
and public transportation
was impacted as well
At 9:30 pm last night, the river in the...
See? You were right to spend the night
Yes, we were
Here
What's that?
It was your father's
Your shirt hasn't dried yet.
Wear this instead
I thought you threw them all out
It's just, one I forgot to throw out
It might be a little small for you but...
It will look good on you
Seconds?
Yes, please
I thought it was a lottery ticket
Look, it's Grandma
Time to get back to work
This is worth...
300,000 yen
It's a fine ink stone
Dear, could you bring me that?
Coming
Your father gave it to me
He said, “It's a first edition that
will be worth a lot someday“
My old man? Yeah
He must've been so proud
The Empty Table
I heard he handed out free copies to
all the neighborhood shops
Dear, let's ask him
You're right
Could you autograph your book
with this ink and brush?
Sure
You've got yourself a fine son
Dad's here
He's here?
There
Sorry to keep you waiting
The lottery tickets are all yours
Realty?
Yeah
See you here again, next month
By then, you'll pay me 150,000 yen,
three months' worth
Don't worry
Take care, Shingo
See you
BYE, then
Let me carry the cleats
At your next game, hit a home run,
not a walk
I like drawing walks
You do?
What kind of future Was I dreaming of
So long To myself from yesterday
I look above and see
A vapor trail streaking by
Where should I go home to?

Maybe I haven't lost a thing at all

So long To myself from yesterday


I close my eyes and call out

I see your face from days long past
Hey, hey I still remember you
Hey, hey I'll never forget you
I thought I heard someone Call out my name


I turn around But you're not there
Hey, hey I still remember you
Hey, hey I'll never forget you
Hey, hey Even in times
When I couldn't believe in myself
You were the only one
Who believed in me
What kind of future Was I dreaming of
Hello again To myself of tomorrow
I won't be able to let myself go
So I'll take another step forward
Another step forward
Just one more step forward
