Hey. Hey, Larry, look.
I'm sorry I got behind.
You said that last month.
Well, business has
been slow this past year,
but it's starting to pick up,
and when I get back,
I got at least
three jobs lined up,
so... so can't you
just cut me some slack?
We did that last month
and the month before that.
What can you pay me now?
Nothing. I'm tapped.
Well, I can't help you.
Wait. Larry.
Been a while, Joe.
How's business?
Just ring it up, Ricardo.
Can I interest you
in our dessert cart?
Keep the change.
Hey!
You don't understand.
We don't hurt women down South.
Oh, please stop!
Stop!
You all right?
Stop!
Please stop!
Next time, why don't you
wrestle a man gator?
Stop! Oh, shit.
What did you do?
I saved you.
No, you screwed it up.
Hey. Hey!
Hey, buster,
the State Troopers are coming.
I'm gonna need you to explain
what just happened.
Okay.
- Hello.
- You hear me?
Speaking. Yes.
W-When? What...
Oh, thank God.
Thank you so much.
Okay. I-I will be there
as soon as possible. Yes.
My daughter's out of the coma,
but it's still touch and go.
What? Coma?
Hey! Hey...
Wake up!
Look, you want
some No-Drowsy?
No. No, no, no.
Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor,
keeps the blood vessels
from opening back up.
Do you have kids?
Do I have kids?
I don't know.
Family?
Wife and daughter.
You like?
Oh, beautiful.
Oops! They're dead.
That's terrible.
I mean I'm sorry.
Well, I-l have
an 18-year-old daughter.
Her name is Billie,
and this morning,
she had a terrible accident.
I got the call, like, an hour
before you showed up.
What the hell does that have
to do with getting strangled?
Look, I don't expect you
to understand this, okay,
but it was the only way
I could help my daughter.
Oh, God.
I'm so woozy. Shit.
Oh, I don't know.
Could you give me
a lift to Mobile?
Is that a siren?
That was a siren, wasn't it?
I don't know.
Billie's such a gear-head,
loves to ride.
Says it's like flying.
Dumb kid.
When I heard
that she was in a coma,
I found that guy
at the truck stop.
Look, I understand what
this all feels like.
I mean, I really do,
and I-I'm very sorry
about what happened
to your daughter,
but this strangling
business is insane.
You are aware of that, right?
You think so?
Did I say something funny?
Look, I haven't
even gotten to the crazy part.
Here it goes.
When I was a teenager,
I almost drowned.
I was sliding on this
frozen lake with my friend,
and the ice broke.
Seconds later, these guys
that were driving by the lake,
they stopped,
and they pulled us out.
You're saying
you left your body?
Yeah.
I've done it a few times.
It has to feel
like I'm drowning,
so I asked this boy
who I knew to choke me.
He thought it was a sex thing.
What did you mean when you said
that I screwed things up
back there?
- What did that mean?
- It's okay.
She found her way back
all by herself.
How can you know that?
How can you be sure
about something like that?
How can anybody be sure about
something like that?
And what if she didn't?
I can't be sure, but it's
exhausting to leave my body.
I don't... I'm not sure
I could do it twice in a day.
You know, I was only
trying to help back there.
I know.
Thanks.
Who knows what is
or isn't possible?
If you could save somebody
like that, that would...
be a miracle.
Hey, Mama.
How you doing?
Mama's here.
Who's that?
Oh.
That's Joe.
He's my friend.
Mama...
I don't know
what happened. I...
But I don't wanna go back there.
Uh...
- Why is she...
- Ma'am. Ma'am.
Step outside.
- Get the crash cart.
- Come...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
I need to get through, please.
Come with me, please.
Maybe here. Okay?
It's okay.
Let's just...
Can we...
Can you do it?
Do it?
Now? Please.
It's just I-l don't
have a lot of time.
I can bring her back,
but I need your help.
Okay? Please.
You'll be fine, okay?
Just do it, okay?
Okay?
Clear.
You know what I remember most?
You know what I remember most?
That when he left,
he walked all the way
out to his car without
ever looking back, not once.
Now you do not
know your daughter.
- Do you?
- No.
You okay?
Did it work?
I don't know.
- Is she okay?
- She's stable.
You did good.
She's back where she belongs.
She will not leave again.
I... Thanks for
looking after her.
Keep an eye on her.
She has been to the other side.
Okay.
Julie, you want some coffee?
No, that's all right.
Thanks.
That's right.
Caffeine's a... a constrictor?
So... So when you go
to the other side,
do you just see people you know,
or are there other people there?
Uh-
Uh, sometimes.
A-And can you
talk to them?
I mean, can... can you
give someone a message?
Ow.
Did I do something wrong?
Oh, no. I just...
I just have a headache.
I'm just tired. I...
I've never done it
twice in one day.
Actually, I-l might just
lie down for a minute.
Do you want me to stay here?
I can let you know
if she wakes up.
Really?
You don't have to go?
Oh, I-I have to get
the load to Biloxi,
but I could stay a couple hours
and still get there by noon.
Ah, wow.
That... That's so nice.
Um, that will be awesome.
Cool.
Thanks.
Um-
I'll... I'll let you rest.
Thanks.
Why do you leave me alone?
You know I don't do good alone.
I don't want to,
but you married a truck driver.
What can I do?
Don't you ever
leave me alone again.
Hey, Julie.
We came to see
how Billie's doing, but, um...
They said just family.
Is she okay?
How is she?
"How is she?"
She's in a hospital.
How do you think she is,
you moron?
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.
She could have died.
You all could have died!
You know what?
Get the fuck out of here!
Get out of my face!
It's gonna be
different, right, Joe?
It's gonna be different.
We can rebuild.
We can make up for lost time.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I'm a friend of your mother's.
Joe. Remember?
Of course I remember.
I'm gonna get your mom.
No. Wait a minute.
- Yes?
- Just...
I just wanna look at you.
Okay.
It's been forever.
Okay.
I'm gonna let your morn
know you're awake.
Don't be gone too long.
I won't.
Julie. Julie?
- Huh?
- Billie's awake.
Oh, okay. Oh.
How... But how is she?
She's good.
Mom?
Yeah.
How do you feel?
Did you see the doctor?
How long was I asleep?
I was...
I'm okay.
It's just...
It's so bright in here.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, I was so scared.
You're still here.
Oh, I-I can go.
No.
Just thought I dreamt you.
It's so bright.
Do you want me to get the nurse?
No.
Don't leave me alone.
I don't do good on my own.
Oh. I-I won't go anywhere.
This is me.
Why don't you come in
for a cup of coffee?
It's still
a long haul to Biloxi.
I missed you, Majors.
Hey.
It's all I ever did.
You're gone so much.
Just sitting in that house.
I miss you.
I told you that I'm
not good on my own,
not with our child.
Not by myself.
It was dangerous to do that.
Oh, man!
Oh, shit. Sorry.
- Coffee.
- Oh.
Smells good.
I made it.
Oh.
Oh, no, no.
If I drink that,
I'm so tired, I'll never
make it out the door,
- let alone Biloxi.
- Just a little bit.
You deserve it, just a little.
Cheers.
You're a strange bird.
Where are you from?
Oh, multiple places.
And somehow
you showed up tonight.
You know, without your help,
my daughter would be gone now.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
Yes, you did.
You're a good man.
Really.
I-I smell like
three days on the road.
I like it.
You know, I haven't...
I haven't really
been with anyone
since my wife and daughter,
you know...
I-I don't even remember
how to have sex.
- Sex?
- Well, I remember.
- You remember?
- I could show you.
Oh, really?
You wanna have sex? Huh?
- I was...
- I could stop right now.
- No, I don't think so.
- Are you sure?
I don't think that's necessary.
Okay. Mmmm!
So how did a nice
German gal like you
wind up in the U.S. of A.
driving a big rig?
I, um... I married
a Marine in Germany.
His name was Chuck,
and, um,
we came here and moved all over.
I liked it.
Billie was born,
and life was great.
And then he got sent
to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Ah, shit.
Yeah.
And when he came back,
he, um...
he didn't really, you know,
until he left for good.
Why?
It was all my fault.
I-I shouldn't have
told him about my...
Ability?
Yeah. And he, um,
wanted me to look
for his friends,
and I did, but I couldn't...
I couldn't find them.
And it didn't matter
anymore at some point,
because he started
seeing them himself.
That's when he left.
I'm so tired.
Where's your room?
Where's her room?
Down the hall on the right.
You know, the more you rest,
the more you'll heal,
and the more you heal,
uh, the better
you'll feel, so...
So eat your beans
with every meal.
I'm sorry.
I thought we were
doing a rhyming thing.
Let us know
if you need anything.
Don't leave me.
You're always leaving me,
and I don't do well on my own.
Sorry?
No kiss goodbye?
Try and get some rest.
She's in bed.
Oh, thanks.
All that?
I know.
It... I know it'll be hard
to keep it all straight,
like, what is she taking
and how many
and when, you know?
Just feel like after three days
of sleeping in a chair,
I don't have enough brain
to even deal
with one of these
childproof caps.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Joe,
for everything you did.
I couldn't have
done it without you.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I'm very glad I could help.
You really went out
of your way to help us.
You know, nobody does that.
We don't have family here.
You know how hard it is
to be on the road
and try to make a living.
Well, I don't know much
about raising children,
but it looks
like you've done a... a good job.
I don't know.
I wish I would have
been here more,
you know, kept an eye on her.
Maybe she would be
taking college classes now
instead of racing
with those idiots.
She's a kid.
You have to make stupid mistakes
when you're young.
Otherwise, you won't
regret anything when you're old.
That sounds terrible, like
one of those
inspirational cat posters.
That's how I let myself
off the hook.
I just feel like
this accident was my fault.
If I had been around more,
she wouldn't have fucked off
with the wrong crowd.
Baby...
do what you have to do.
Working's not optional.
Hmm?
Can you stay
a little bit longer?
Oh, I'd love to, but I really
gotta get the load to Biloxi.
I'm already three days
behind schedule.
They're gonna kill me.
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.
It's not your fault.
I mean, I...
I know what you
are going through.
I know what it feels like
to lose someone,
but you brought her back.
Now just... just being a tiny,
little part of that
makes everything feel
a little less dark.
Hold me, baby.
Mmm.
Hold daddy tight.
All right. Well, I really
gotta hit the road.
But I'll check in on you
when I'm heading back. Okay?
Okay.
- Get out of here.
- Giddy-up.
So you're not gonna pay me?
Heh. Yeah. I'm gonna pay you
what you got coming
minus the late penalties.
That's dog shit.
That's not even bullshit.
- Now, look...
- That's just dog shit.
You have been a boil on my ass
ever since
you walked in this door.
MY company says
' gotta pay you $18.46,
so I tell you what.
Keep the change.
Hey, Joe. Joe,
you need to come outside.
They're taking your truck.
What the hell
are you doing? Huh?!
- All right. Okay.
- Huh?!
Here we go.
This is the part where I say
"I wouldn't do that,"
you ignore me,
and then my partner here,
he hits you so hard
we gotta contact next of kin.
All right. Okay?
Just... Just hear me out.
There was an accident, okay?
This woman,
her daughter was in a coma,
and I had to drive her
to a hospital in Mobile,
so just have a heart, you know,
- kindness, charity?
- Sure.
Well, that's a very elaborate
sob story there, buddy.
You should sell that shit
to telenovela.
- You're gonna take my truck?
- Mm-hmm.
A man without a truck
isn't a man.
You know that, right?
I'm taking your truck.
Sorry, buddy.
At least just...
Okay, just let me...
let me get my personal
belongings in the box.
- Can I get that?
- No.
First you pay your past due.
Then you square up with Larry.
Then maybe you get
your truck back.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey...
We came to see
how Billie's doing.
Billie's okay, for a girl
that almost got killed
in a terrible wreck.
I know, right?
I'm surprised she's not
smeared all over the highway.
She fell in
with the wrong crowd.
- Bunch of assholes.
- She means us, Rick.
Oh, really?
I mean, we kinda suck,
but I don't think we're
really that influential.
All right, look, I'm sorry.
It kills me,
what happened to Billie,
but it was an accident.
- It wasn't anyone's fault.
- Really?
We try to watch out for her,
for each other,
but you can't
keep up with Billie,
not on a motorcycle.
Nobody can.
Say hi. Take her lunch.
Not while she's on real drugs.
Hey.
Hungry?
You're lucky.
Really lucky.
What do you remember
about the accident?
Not much.
I remember after.
But before, not much.
What about getting
on the highway?
Nope.
Do you remember anything
before the accident?
Not really.
Really?
Do you have amnesia? What...
What did the doctor say?
I don't remember.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
I've been okay.
What about you?
How's Billie?
She seems better.
You need some help?
Let's just say
that would not suck.
At all.
Everything all right?
Oh, um, well...
Why don't you come
and stay with us?
I could use the help,
the company.
Okay?
Thanks, Julie.
Uh, that's a...
that's a real big
help right now.
Okay.
See you soon.
Bye.
Nobody has this many friends.
You're texting your friends?
Look, I don't mind
waiting on you,
but maybe you could, uh,
pick up the trash, huh?
It's right here, right here.
Yeah.
What do you want?
I don't know.
Why don't you be
my Billie again?
You know, help like you used to.
We are a team, remember?
We have so much
to be thankful for.
Yeah, you're right.
I thought I lost you.
You're all I have.
I don't know what
I would do without you.
Hey, I'm back.
- You're in a good mood.
- I'm happy to be back.
Yeah. Come in.
All right.
You got a drink?
- A beer?
- No. I like bourbon.
- Oh.
- Everybody asleep?
How you doin'?
- I'm great.
- I missed you.
- You know I missed you?
- Yeah. Whoo!
Roll in. Roll in.
No, I said roll in.
- Oh. Oh.
- Yeah.
So, like, fall... fall in now.
Roll this way.
- In, in, in.
- Oh, oh.
Whoo!
Mmm. Beautiful weed.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it should be.
I-I took it from
Billie's friend,
and Mike is a dope dealer.
- Ah.
- Know what I mean?
- B-Billie's good?
- Huh?
- Billie's good?
- Uh, yeah, you know,
she's getting better,
like, physically.
But, um, I don't know.
She's... She's not really
her old self, you know.
- I don't know.
- Huh.
But she did take
a pretty good knock on the head.
Wh-What? What?
- I don't know.
- Wait. What?
- Oh, but you...
- Oh, my God. It's so wrong.
- It's so wrong.
- You... You don't ju...
You don't just recover
from something like that,
bounce back, even if
she is a teenager.
Right. Well,
I think that you think
that I'm overthinking it,
but you didn't know her before.
- Uh, no, no.
- Right, so...
According to her,
we're old buddies.
- You know, it's weird.
- Well...
Don't be surprised if she's
making goo-goo eyes at you
just to piss me off.
"Goo-goo eyes."
You know. You know
what that looks like.
Shh! Shh!
Shh!
"Goo-goo e..."
So... So where am I slee...
Where am I sleeping tonight?
Where am I sleeping?
Where am I...
On the couch.
On the what?
On the couch.
C-ouch!
That hurts.
Heh. Well...
I am...
My daughter is at home,
and I never bring men here.
- Okay?
- No, I-I understand.
She, uh... She asleep?
Um...
yeah, she took,
like, a Percocet or two,
like, three hours ago.
Should be, uh, sleeping longer.
So probably, uh, I'll start
hitting the couch, then.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Oh, I hope you don't mind,
I like to sleep in the nude.
Hope that's not a problem.
Is that a problem?
That's actually a huge problem.
- Why is that?
- That's a huge problem.
Like, this is
just a huge problem.
It's a problem?
Just a problem.
I don't...
Shh. You're too loud.
You're so...
Don't yell.
You're yelling.
Remember that movie,
"The Exorcist"?
Remember "The Exorcist"?
Remember Linda Blair,
when she had the crucifix?
- Who?
- She's going... Fuck me!
- Fuck me!"
- Shh!
I want you say, "Fuck... " Can
you say it like her? "Fuck me."
- What? Okay. Okay. Yeah. I am.
- Say it.
- Shh!
- Say it. Say, "Fuck..."
"Fuck me!" Can you?
Like Linda Blair, "Exorcist."
- "Fuck me!" Say it.
- No!
Come on.
Whoo!
Shh, too loud.
You're too loud.
...really
working it up here.
I know you'll soon be...
You know,
it's like, "What?"
I want to take you to a movie.
Yeah, awesome... Like,
what would... what would we see?
Whatever's playing.
I like having me
some air conditioning.
Air... Air conditioning?
I like going
into some air conditioning
and watching a movie...
- Okay.
- ..In a dark room.
- Oh.
- Ow!
- Oops. Sorry.
- Wh-What's the deal?
Are you mad at me,
or you just clumsy?
I'm sorry. You're
making me nervous.
You all right? Sorry.
Well, she ought
to make it to Memphis.
That's awesome.
Is it gonna make it back?
Ah, ah, ah.
I take that as a yes.
- Do you want a beer?
- Oh, yeah. That'd be great.
Well, I'm gonna drain
the main vein.
So do you want a beer?
Does the Tin Man
have a sheet metal cock?
Oh, hey, baby.
Do you need anything?
Not yet.
You guys, this is...
this is good.
This is... I like this.
It's so nice to have
you guys here. Love it.
The animal's
instincts in killing
often mimic
their sexual behaviours
which can become violent,
sometimes resulting
in injury or death
to the female partner.
This is all part of survival
in the animal kingdom.
Hey, Billie,
can you help me?
Billie, come help me.
What?
- Can you help me?
- I'm sick.
What's going on?
Are you okay?
I felt dizzy when I stood up,
so I'm just gonna sit here
for a while.
- I can help.
- No. That's okay.
Are you guys okay with okra?
- Man, okra's real nice.
- I hate okra.
Since when?
Since always.
Just didn't want
to hurt your feelings.
Well, apparently
you're done with that now.
Hey, no fixing that.
She's not riding anymore.
You want it in selling
condition, don't you?
I hope you didn't ask Joe
to fix your bike.
Didn't have to.
He offered.
- That's nice.
- It is.
You should ask him to stay.
You're not good on your own.
What are you talking about?
I remember when Dad left.
It was nighttime,
but I was still awake.
You were crying.
I was crying.
And it was raining,
so it felt like the whole world
was crying.
You know what I remember most?
Is that when he left,
he walked all the way
out to his car
without ever
looking back, not once.
What's wrong with you?
Ah, fuck.
No, I don't give a goddamn
what the law says, Larry.
This is extortion,
blackmail, whatever.
Okay.
I'll tell you what.
You go to hell.
Sorry.
What did he say?
If I don't pay
at least 500 bucks,
they won't give me
my personal property back.
I'm guessing it's not
just a pair of underwear?
No, no. It was all my photos
of Mary and my daughter in a box
and these little cards
Mary would make me
for birthdays, anniversaries.
Her ring was in there, too.
- A wedding ring?
- Yes.
What happened to her?
I'm sorry.
Maybe you don't...
I was doing
a three-day run,
and Mary and I
had been fighting,
'cause she... she'd hate it
when I had to leave.
And the last night,
the last night I was gone...
I would have been home
by noon the next day.
Her stupid cigarette
lit the couch on fire,
old piece of shit, and
the fire spread into...
Her...
The fire spread into...
I'm sorry. I can't say her name,
'cause I get very upset.
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's my little girl.
She was five.
She was five.
Well, they say that
the, uh, smoke got to her
before the fire did,
so... but I
should have stayed.
I should never have left.
Work's not optional.
That's what
I kept telling myself
when I walked out the door,
but this time, it was different.
She was scared.
She was crying.
I said, "Baby,
I gotta go. I got...
"I gotta pay the loan
on the truck.
I gotta pay the mortgage
on the house."
Now the truck is gone,
house is gone.
I shouldn't have left.
I-I should have stayed.
And... And they took
the last little piece
of them I-I had.
I'm sorry. That's terrible.
Mama. Papa.
Girl, you really
mangled this thing.
You're lucky to be alive.
Where's my mom?
She said she had to go
into town early.
Said she
had to run some errands.
So it's just us today?
Yeah. Looks like
it's me and you.
It's open.
- Hi.
- Hey.
There you go.
Hey, Joe.
- What?
- Come here.
You okay?
Yeah.
How's it going out there?
That's my shirt.
Used to be.
So... how's it goin'?
Eh, I got it started.
Cross your fingers,
I can keep it running.
You can fix anything.
Yeah, but somewhere
your mother's
crossing her fingers
it won't stay running,
so you gotta
cancel out her vote.
Well, back at it, I guess.
You're fucking her, aren't you?
- Who?
- Who?
There's only three of us
here, Majors,
and you're certainly
not fucking me.
Don't call me that.
Why?
That's what I always call you.
How do you know my last name?
Because it's my last name, too.
Don't do that.
I missed you, Majors.
I said stop it!
It's all I ever did.
You're gone so much.
Just sitting in that house.
I miss you.
Billie's gone.
It's me, Mary.
You don't know
what you're saying.
Mary's dead, so you... you
have some respect for my wife,
or I'll spank it into you.
You never hit me.
You never did,
even when I dared you...
even when I hit you first.
When Billie was
in the hospital...
her spirit left her body...
and mine came in.
I'm here, baby.
Why are you fucking her?
Huh?
I know what you really want.
Why are you doing this?
We could have
what we've had before.
We could have another child.
Don't you miss Sarah?
Don't you miss our baby girl?
I was with her
right until I came back to you,
and I miss her
every second that I'm here.
How...
How do you... How did you
know her name?
I know everything
about you, Joe,
about your dad,
how he used to beat you.
I'm your wife,
and I'm Sarah's mother.
You believe that woman can
bring people back from the dead.
Why can't you
believe that it's me?
Because... Because I
don't deserve this.
I'm here.
Oh, Mary.
Mary.
Mary.
Mary. Mary.
I missed you.
- Mary. Mary.
- You miss me?
Honey. Honey. Something...
Shh. Shh. Somebody...
- You got it.
- Hey.
Told you I would.
How's Billie?
Thank you.
A-Asleep in her room,
I think.
I-I don't know.
I haven't seen her.
I know everything
about you, Joe.
How did things go
while I was gone?
Good. Nothing...
Nothing happened.
I fixed her bike.
Good. I'm gonna
get that thing
sold on craigslist
before she wakes up.
That your wife?
Yes.
Pretty.
Whoa!
Oh, yeah. Okay, wait.
Wait. You get me.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa. All right.
Cold shower!
You believe that woman
can bring people back
from the dead.
Don't you miss Sarah?
Don't you miss our baby girl?
We could have another child.
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
It looks like
invasion of privacy.
Joe's not gonna like it,
that you're going
through his stuff.
You don't know
anything about him.
Well, I know him
better than you think.
And I might ask him
to stay a little bit longer.
Why?
Because I like him.
You're just gonna fuck it up...
like you did with your husband.
My husband?
Your father, young lady.
Yeah.
That's what I meant.
You're so distracted.
Why? Why?
What do you wanna do?
- This?
- I-
 was just... I was...
Uh...
When Billie was in the hospital,
her spirit left her body,
and mine came in.
What are you doing?
She's gonna come between us.
She's the reason
we're back together.
You can't hurt her.
You'd be surprised
at what I can do.
I was.
I'm not gonna let it
go wrong this time.
Hi.
You tampered in something
that was not your business.
But my daughter was dying.
That was our business.
Now you do not know
your daughter, do you?
No. No.
Every soul leaves
its body eventually.
That is the way of things.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God, you sexy little tart.
Sexy little tart.
We're gonna stay together.
Wh-What if she
finds out?
You're not gonna pussy out
on me this time.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You're not gonna pussy out
on me this time.
Babe, you gonna talk to me?
Let's talk dirty.
Read to me from "Memories," Joe.
Again?
Oh, yes.
"They enjoyed
the Arc de Triomphe."
Oh, yes.
"You rode your hap-penis,
"and she straddled my mouth,
"your tongues
joining above me."
But I found Billie.
I brought her back.
You brought someone back.
These spirits linger
around people they have lost.
Who was with you when you
cross over to the other side?
Uh...
Joe.
Joe was with me.
Did he lose someone?
Yes.
Um, his wife and his daughter,
they died in a fire.
Spirits that leave this world
unexpectedly and horribly
are the ones
that hold on the longest.
Okay. H-How do I fix it?
You have done enough.
The spirit may be confused.
It may be weak.
It may go back where it belongs.
It-It may?
No. No. This is...
It's not leaving.
Well, please, come on.
Th-There's gotta be a way.
That way is the way
you are walking now.
But if you want my advice, stop.
When you try to change
the way of things,
you never know what will happen.
"Your peach juice cascaded
"over and upon
my golden cock." Agh!
"I knew then that we were
a family, a tribe." Agh!
"Our heat melting the snow
beneath us on top
"of the mountain
as the Inuit applauded."
Oh! Oh, yeah.
Oh, God! Fuck!
Don't you ever
leave me alone again.
What was that?
W-What was that? What was that?
- It was the cat.
- Huh? Cat?
You don't...
You don't have a cat.
You don't have a cat!
Ahh! Ahh!
Whoo!
- Oh, my God! Oh, God!
- Come on, Julie.
Julie, wait. Wait. Julie?
- Julie?
- Oh, my God.
Julie.
That... That is Mary, my wife.
You brought my wife back.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Who you just fucked,
Th-that's Billie.
That's my daughter.
I'm sorry to say this.
Billie is dead.
That is Mary.
No, no, no, no. She's not dead.
She's lost, okay?
And Th-that thing
hijacked her body,
and I need you to help me
get her back and fix this!
- Ugh.
- Oh, really? How?
I-I don't know how.
Fuck!
Julie.
- Fucking...
- Julie.
- Julie.
- Where is she? Where is she?
She locked herself in her room.
- Now, I am so sorry, but...
- Shut the fuck up!
Your voice is disgusting to me!
You took advantage of me
and of her.
You fix this.
You better fix it!
What do you expect me to do,
kill my wife?
Put your fucking pants on!
You're gross!
Well, I don't know
what makes you say that, but...
Okay.
So we're going to...
Okay. And then
you'll choke me
so I can get Billie.
Y-You hit her.
Julie? Julie?
She'll be fine.
She's a tough bitch.
She was gonna kill me, Joe,
and I'm not ready to die,
not again,
not until you're ready
to come with me.
Did you have to hit her so hard?
We have to get out of here.
Go? Go where?
Home.
I wanna take you home, Joe.
We need some money.
I got it.
I have an idea.
Are you coming with me?
You feeling better?
Kinda. I just had
to get out of there.
My mom wouldn't stop hovering.
You're looking better.
Yeah.
All to clean living
and Oxycodone.
- You staying?
- You guys got anything to eat?
Yeah. I think we have
some leftover waffle fries
and Miracle Whip
and some Fruit Roll-Ups.
You can help yourself.
Cool.

Get him, Joe.
Hey, man.
- I think he's dead.
- Baby, are you okay?
I didn't mean to.
It was... It was an accident.
Hey. Hey, man!
Baby...
it was him or you.
Let's get out of here.
Maybe he's not dead. Maybe
we should call an ambulance.
It's too late.
Oh, God.
Um, hi. Um...
I just wanted to repor...
Um, my daughter, sh...
Actually, she...
It's okay. She's fine.
- Put your fucking hands up!
- Mike. What happened?
- Put 'em up!
- Put the gun down, Mike. Mike.
Sit the fuck down!
Sit the fuck down!
Okay. Okay.
I'm sitting down, okay?
Please put the gun down, Mike.
Why did Billie
and that friend of yours rob us?
I can explain.
I can try to explain.
Why? Explain!
They fucking shot Rick!
- What?
- They killed him!
- They almost killed me.
- Oh, my God. Fuck.
- That guy is your friend.
- No...
- What's he done to her?
- That wasn't Billie.
It wasn't, okay? I know that
nothing has made any sense.
And I'm gonna explain it to you,
but nothing
that I can say
is gonna make any sense.
How hard did they
fucking hit you?
You remember this, right, baby?
Sure, I do.
I didn't mean
to burn this place down.
It all happened so quickly.
I told you that I'm
not good on my own.
I wanted you to find us.
Let's go Play.
Let's go Play.
A ghost is taking over
Billie's body
like some sort of hermit crab?
Mike, we can't call
the police, okay?
I want Billie home.
I don't want her in jail.
Well, the cops are the last
thing I wanna deal with.
- They shot Rick with my gun.
- Right.
I'm sorry about Rick, okay?
How do we find them?
You have to choke me.
Wouldn't just...
just shooting you be easier?
You're not happy, are you, Joe?
I'm just taking it all in.
Why'd it have to be cloudy?
I wanted to see the stars.
No stars where you were?
I don't remember any.
It's all starting
to fade away now.
All I remember is missing you.
You want the stars, baby?
I'll give you the stars.
You gonna give me
the stars, Joe?
I always said I would.
You don't fool me, Joe.
What does that mean?
You never wanted any of this.
I wanted you.
I wanted our little girl.
I was just on the road so much,
I-I didn't think
I deserved you.
Did you deserve Julie?
I don't deserve anybody.
- You remember the plan?
- Plan.
That's a cute name
for this insanity.
It's gonna be different,
right, Joe?
It's gonna be different.
We can rebuild.
We can make up for lost time.
- You mean that?
- I do. I-I really do.
I mean, I-I don't
understand how it happened,
but the universe giving me...
And me.
A second chance, it's...
I wanna believe you, Joe.
No, I'm not going
on the road anymore.
I'm staying here.
You're stuck with me.
You're not
gaslighting me, are you?
- What is it?
- What? What?
Uh, I heard something.
That was your conscience. It
thinks you're a piece of shit.
- Aw, fuck!
- Stay where you are.
Man, that guy came after me.
Mike, it's me.
No, save it.
You're not Billie,
and it makes me sick
that something like you
is crawling around inside her.
Mary, I just want
my daughter back, okay? I...
How bad?
Drop the fucking gun,
or I'll blow his head off.
Nobody's shooting
that sad bastard but me.
Is she another one of
your fixer-uppers, Joe?
I told you that I'm
not good on my own,
not with our child,
not with myself.
It was dangerous to do that.
Sarah was dead before the fire.
- It was harder than I thought.
- Y-You...
She was little,
but she didn't wanna die.
Y-You'd never hurt her.
Not her, baby, you.
I wanted you to find us.
I didn't mean
to burn this place down.
It all happened so quickly.
You killed your own daughter?
How 'bout I
just shoot you, Mama?
Then I don't have to worry about
Billie repossessing her body.
- Drop it now!
- You wouldn't shoot Billie.
You're so in love with Billie,
it's fucking embarrassing.
- Drop the fucking gun!
- Mike.
Mike, drop the gun, please.
Let's go play.
Let's go play.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Let's go play.
Sarah.
Let's go Play-
Let's go Play-
- Sarah.
- Joe. Baby, don't...
- Sarah. Sarah.
- Baby.
Joe.
Mary, I just want
my daughter back.
Come on. Come on.
What have you done?!
You are where you belong.
No. It's too late.
You're dying.
You can't keep me here!
Mommy?
You came back for me, Mommy.
Stop.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
S-Sarah.
Okay.
Hey.
Who are you?
I am... I am Billie.
What's going on?
- Where did we meet?
- I am...
- Where?
- What's going... Are we...
Huh?
Shop class.
Do you have amnesia, dumb-ass?
Wait. Where am I?
Mama!
Mama! Mama!
What happened to her?
- Mommy.
- Billie.
- Mama. Mama.
- Billie. Billie.
- We have to help her!
- I know, but we can't.
- All right? Billie.
- What the fuck did you do?!
He sort of smiled
and kissed me goodbye.
The tears were
beginning to show.
As he drove away
on that rainy night,
I begged him to go slow.
Whether he heard,
I'll never know.
Why can't Joe
do the fucking dishes?
He doesn't do shit around here
but sit on his ass.
He can't even cut
the lawn worth a fuck.
And what do you do?
You mommy him and baby him.
Stop it, please, Kirby.
No, you fucking stop it.
Fuck! Stop sucking
the life out of me!
You guys are like two
fucking fleas, draining me.
Well, I'm sorry you're so
disappointed in the both of us.
Oh, you're fucking
disa... Really?
- Stop.
- Jesus.
Should burn this fucking place
to the ground,
- is what I ought to do.
- Joe. Joe.
- No, honey.
- A backbone.
Joe. No, he's drunk, Joe!
- Shut up.
- Don't listen to him!
- Do it.
- Please, please.
Both of you
please stop. Stop!
