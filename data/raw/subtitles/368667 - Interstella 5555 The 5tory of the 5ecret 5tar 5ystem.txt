Les musiciens sont des magiciens.
C'est ce que je dis toujours.
J'ai toujours eu ce rêve,
ou plutôt cet espoir
depuis mon enfance, et...
Le rêve lui-même est venu vers moi.
Comment l'expliquer...
J'ai toutes ces lumières
qui clignotent dans ma tête.
Quelques paroles de Discovery
fait par un fan pour d'autres fans....

"Aerodynamic"
"Digital Love"
Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long
Don't stop come a little closer 
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger 
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun 
We were dancing all night long 
The time is right to put my arms around you 
You're feeling right 
You wrap your arms around too 
But suddenly I feel the shining sun 
Before I knew it this dream was all gone 
Ooh...I don't know what to do...
About this dream and you 
I wish this dream comes true 
Ooh...I don't know what to do...
About this dream and you 
We'll make this dream comes true 
Why don't you play the game ?
Why don't you play the game ? 
"Harder Better Faster Stronger"
Work it... make it... do it... makes us...
Harder... better... faster... stronger... 
More Than ... Hour
Hour ... Never
Ever ... After
Work is ... Over
Work it... make it... do it... makes us...
Harder... better... faster... stronger... 
Work it harder, make it better 
do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after hour 
work is never over 
Work it harder, make it better 
do it faster, makes us stronger
Work it harder, make it better,
do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after hour
work is never over 
"Crescendolls"
"Nightvision"
"SuperHeroes"
Marvel Super Hero ?
"SuperHeroes"
"HighLife"
"Something About Us"
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
Cause there's something between us anyway
I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life
"Voyager"
"Verdis Quo"
"Short Circuit"
"Face To Face"
What's going on 
Could this be my understanding
It's not your fault 
I was being too demanding 
I must admit it's my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different 
There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face 
I turned away cause I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion 
I realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion 
It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face 
It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face 
"Too Long"
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is getting strong
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is in my bones
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is getting strong
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is in my bones
Too long, can you feel it,
too long, oh can you feel it
Too long, can you feel it,
too long, oh can you feel it
At last the long wait is over
the weight is off my shoulder
I'm taking all control
My mind is set so free
I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me
Too long, can you feel it,
too long, oh can you feel it
Too long, can you feel it,
too long, oh can you feel it
I see, you feel the way I do, the feeling all so true
the good feelings coming thru
My mind is set so free
I'm where I want to be, to get the best of me
Too long, can you feel it,
too long, oh can you feel it
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is getting strong
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is in my bones
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is getting strong
It's been much too long, I feel it comming on
The feeling is in my bones
Too long, can you feel it,
too long, oh can you feel it
At last the long wait is over
the weight is off my shoulder
I'm taking all control yeah
My mind is set so free
I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me
Too long, can you feel it,
too long, oh can you feel it
You know you need it,hey I need it too but alright

We're gonna move
