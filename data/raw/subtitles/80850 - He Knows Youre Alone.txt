- What's that?
- What's what?
I heard something.
I don't hear anything.
Maybe it's my boyfriend.
Hey, come on.
That did it.
What you going to do?
You just wait here.
And if it's him,
I'm going to break his neck.
Don't hurt him, Don. Please?
Don?
Don, is that you?
Please, answer me, Don.
I'm not letting you back in.
Come on, Don.
Don't play games with me.
Don?
Donnie?
Donnie?
I can't take this anymore.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Is that you, Ruthie?
Is somebody there?
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Where have you been?
This is great.
Somebody's following me.
Will you watch the movie?
But when I was down
in the bathroom...
- Come on.
- No.
I really don't like this.
Can we go home?
She's going to get it.
OK, you can look now.
You OK, Marie?
You still want to go home?
Marie?
Marie?
Oh, God.
Weapon went
right through the vertebrae...
severed the spinal cord,
and pierced the heart.
The guy's an animal.
The knife went right
through the chair.
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard to do.
Gamble's here, Frank.
Are you kidding?
Back of those chairs are metal.
Len, how are you?
This better be good, Frank.
Well, I just thought
you might like to see this one.
Couldn't it wait till morning?
Yeah. Yeah, it could've.
But I don't think you could've.
Come on. Come on.
She just told me
the whole story.
All right. Can we hear it again,
sweetheart?
She came back
from the bathroom...
and she said something
about someone following her.
But I thought
she was imagining it...
that the movie,
you know, it got to her.
I don't know.
Maybe if we'd have left...
she'd still be alive.
Frank, come here.
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Frank, why'd you get me
out of bed for this one?
She was getting married, Len.
Next week.
I bet it's him.
Now, wait, wait.
Don't jump to any conclusions.
I mean,
it might be a coincidence.
- Coincidence?
- Yeah.
No, Frank. He's back.
He's giving me a second chance.
He's giving me a second chance.
What do you call that?
Hey, this is
"Doll of Manhattan."
Yeah? I'm putting
all my trust in you.
You like it?
You look like
the Statue of Liberty.
What's your favorite song?
Come on and tell me.
I'll play it.
Well, it's a big day.
Big day for you, Len.
What are you doing here?
Look, I think you should leave.
Ray, listen, I'm sorry things
worked out the way they did.
I didn't plan any of this.
It just happened, OK?
Now, come on.
Would you leave, please?
Ray?
Ray, come on. Get...
Ray...
- Hey, Amy.
- Yeah?
You going to miss me?
Oh, probably not.
Hey, I was only kidding.
Of course I'm going to miss you.
I love you.
You're always so serious.
Are you going to miss me?
- Sure.
- Yeah?
Hey, while I'm away,
do you think you could...
pick up that couch
I wanted for the living room?
Oh, it's so exciting.
Gosh, you go away
for a bachelor's weekend...
and I get to pick out furniture.
Come on, watch your step,
you guys.
Just what are you
going to do this weekend?
Well, I don't know.
I mean, Joyce and Nancy
are sleeping over.
OK, you ready to sing
that song I taught you?
Yeah.
Don't let me catch
that Marvin hanging around...
- or I'll...
- What?
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Stepped on a turtle
and down came her girdle
Here comes the bride,
all dressed in white
Stepped on a turtle
and down came her girdle
What's wrong with you guys?
I can't count on you
for anything.
Hey, Bernie!
- How are you?
- Hi. How was it?
OK. We had a good time.
How's everything?
- OK.
- Fine.
What'd you think of my present?
Don't we get money?
A stack of ones at the wedding.
Hey, private!
Come on.
- Hi there.
- All right.
Hottest pornos in town.
And we pick up the women
on the way.
- Mary?
- And Evelyn and Ginny.
- All right!
- It's gonna be good.
Hey, you guys.
What's going on down there?
Come on, let's get going.
I want to get there before dark.
All right.
Come here.
Have a good time up there, OK?
- I'll try.
- Yeah?
Don't drink too much beer.
You know what it does to you.
Bye.
Watch out for
lions and tigers and bears.
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Be good.
Bernie, there really aren't
any bears up there, are there?
Sometimes.
How can they have a good time
without us up there?
Let me count the ways.
If there's a woman up there,
Tommy will find her.
He's got a sixth sense
about that.
All men have that sense.
It's the only sense they got.
All right, let's go through it
one more time.
It's like I've been telling you.
We were sitting there
watching the movie...
and this chick,
she just started screaming.
Everybody was screaming.
You didn't see anybody
leave the theater?
No. Uh-uh.
You're sure?
I was watching the movie, man.
How about you?
I... I had my eyes closed.
All right, you can go.
Look, I'm sorry
we couldn't be any help.
I hope you catch him.
Yeah.
Was that the last of them?
One, two, three, four.
Up, two, three, four.
Stretch, two, three, four.
Up, two, three, four.
Over, two, three, four.
Up, two, three, four.
Down, two, three, four.
What time is it?
Quarter to 1:00.
Oh, thank God.
Only fifteen more minutes.
Quit dogging it, Joyce.
Sometimes
I think I'm a masochist.
It's good for you.
It relieves frustrations.
I prefer sex.
Come on, girls. No talking.
OK, legs off the bar.
Fifth position.
Ready, and...
Kick, plié, kick, plié.
Kick, plié, kick, plié.
Higher, plié, higher, plié.
Up, plié, up, plié.
OK, girls, take five.
Two more weeks, Amy.
Yeah, I know.
You sound thrilled.
It's just happening
so fast, you know?
And I'm not sure
I want to get married.
I mean, not just to Phil...
to anybody.
Personally,
I always liked Marvin.
One of your few failures.
I tried hard.
The guy's got willpower.
Phil doesn't even want me
to have a career.
He's hinting
I should quit school.
Not exactly your liberated male.
Mm-mmm.
Now, you take Bernie...
I'll take Bernie.
She will take Bernie.
Don't you dare.
Bernie has lots of money,
and he'll do anything I say.
What about that professor?
Yeah. Hmm?
Darling, that's lust.
Pure lust!
Give me a break.
Well, it's a chance
to ace philosophy this weekend.
It's too bad they don't
give anything higher...
than an "A,"
like a double "A."
Or a triple "A."
My average could sure use it.
- That's for sure.
- Who asked you?
Everybody up!
Oh, shit. Come on.
Hey, Amy, you don't have
to get married, you know.
Ready, and...
You going to stay the night?
Your parents
are away for a week, right?
- Right.
- I'm staying a week.
- Good!
- Look who's coming.
Hey, he's really cute
when he's not teaching.
- Is that his wife?
- Doesn't she know about you?
No, no.
Oh, right. The party.
- I have to go back on Tuesday.
- That's right.
I'd like to go
on Wednesday, too.
What's the matter?
Hello, Professor.
Hi. Do I know you?
We're in your class.
Oh! That's right. My class.
Right.
They're in my class, honey.
Yeah.
The introductory class, right?
- Right!
- That's the one.
That's right. Beginners.
That's nice.
We thought so.
Oh, this is my wife,
and this is...
I'm sorry. I seem to have
forgotten your names.
I'm Joyce.
How do you do, Joyce?
This is Nancy.
- Hello.
- Hi, Nancy.
- And that's Amy.
- Hi.
I think you girls
should hurry home...
and study for Monday's final.
You wouldn't give me an "F,"
now, would you, Professor?
I think that's
the right idea, Professor.
Bye. Nice to meet you.
Good-bye! See you Monday!
Study hard.
What was that all about?
These kids...
Sometimes they really seem
a little foolish.
I'm gonna bust his balls
tonight.
- Joyce.
- Well, I am!
Come on, you guys.
I'll be late for my fitting.
- Yeah, right.
- OK! I'll see you tonight.
- All right.
- Bye!
God damn it.
Watch where you're going!
Can I help you?
Yeah. An ice cream cone,
please.
What flavor?
That one.
- Sugar cone?
- Sure.
One or two scoops?
Well, just one.
Raspberry!
You're really enjoying that,
aren't you?
Delicious.
Sprinkles?
- Huh?
- Sprinkles?
Oh, no, thanks.
That's all right.
That's fifty cents.
Oh, I'm sorry.
There. Thank you very much.
Hey! Will you watch it?
- Marvin!
- This is my favorite shirt.
What are you doing here?
This was my favorite shirt.
I'll probably have to give it
to one of the stiffs at work.
I thought somebody
was following me.
Probably
one of Phil's watchdogs.
Will you look at my shirt?
lt'll come out, Marvin.
It won't. This stuff stains.
It's like blood.
Come on.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Could we have some water,
please?
- I spilled some...
- How'd you know where I'd be?
You have a fitting
at Renaissance...
followed by a rendezvous
with Father McKenna.
You've been cross-examining
my little sister again, huh?
Me? Never.
Thank you.
She told me that turkey left
town for his bachelor party.
Phil's not a turkey.
OK. He's an asshole.
Don't say that, Marvin.
How about the time he beat me up
and stole my yo-yo?
Marvin,
that was in the sixth grade!
I don't forget things like that.
At least this time
he didn't beat me up.
And I wasn't stolen, Marvin.
You just lost me.
I left town
for one lousy summer...
and Phil sweeps you
off your feet?
Well, you shouldn't have gone.
You shouldn't marry somebody
on the rebound.
Rebound?!
This is such a pleasant place.
Why are you looking like that?
I'm the one
that ended our relationship.
That's all right. I forgive you.
Did you just come
from the morgue?
Yeah. They got me on days now.
The regular guy died.
I gave him our best freezer.
Why are you still working there?
I like it.
It's fun, cool in the summer.
Very educational.
Are you still going into...
What's that called?
Forensic medicine.
You know, like Jack Klugman.
- Amy...
- Boy...
Don't marry Phil.
Two weeks from Sunday.
You coming?
Well, I thought
it was very mature of you...
to invite your old boyfriend
to your wedding...
and to show you
how mature I can be...
I ain't gonna be there.
Suit yourself.
You're too good for Phil, Amy.
Look, marry me!
Phil's weird.
He's got insanity in his family.
He's a closet...
Ralph, where's Roz?
Out of town.
Her sister got sick.
She's a beauty, isn't she?
Come on, let's put it on.
Try not breathing.
That's what Roz does.
Ralph?
Yeah.
Is it worth it?
Huh?
Well...
getting married, I mean.
Get dressed, kid.
I'll tell you the truth, though.
Sometimes
I wish I never got married...
but other times, I wouldn't
trade Roz for anybody.
Marriage is like that.
Good times, bad times...
you learn to live with it...
but it's better
than being alone.
- Ralph?
- Yeah.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Come here. Hey.
- Good.
- Yeah?
OK, there you are.
Now turn around.
- Yeah. What?
- I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I'll get rid of it.
Yeah. Lift.
Good. There. Just one more.
It's all right.
Just think of me as your father.
Yes, now...
You put it on.
Turn. That's beautiful.
Finished. OK, take it off.
Is anybody there?
Ralph?
Run away with me.
We'll move to New York...
and exist on our intense love
for each other.
What do you say?
How about it?
Get out of here, Marvin.
I want to talk to you.
Well, not now.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
- What time tomorrow?
- 7:00.
Good. Bye.
You didn't say good-bye.
- Good-bye, hard head.
- That's better.
Thanks, Ralph. So long.
So long, kid.
Oh, Ralph, here.
And tell Rozalind I hope
her sister feels better soon.
She better feel better soon.
I haven't had a good meal
in three days.
Anyway, I'm not so hot
on customer relations.
You're not so bad.
Tell Rozalind
I'll see her next week.
Bye-bye.
- Amy.
- Oh!
Hello, Father.
Is this
what's bothering you, Amy?
Yes.
You see, this is rusty water
from a very leaky pipe.
If I ever remember,
I'm going to have...
to call a plumber
and get it fixed.
Gosh. Oh, but the organ.
Oh, yes, the organ.
Well, that's Mr. Smith, my cat.
You see, he's very fond
of playing the organ...
and very good, too.
Anything else?
No, I think that's quite enough.
Amy, are you still having
second thoughts?
More than ever.
Well...
You know,
that's not so very strange.
I know a lot of people who
have been married for years...
and they're still having
second thoughts.
That's encouraging.
But they should've never been
married to begin with.
They just made bad decisions
and picked incompatible mates.
Are you trying to tell me
something, Father?
Me? No. I don't meddle.
I just want you to be sure.
So, tell me...
when are your parents
coming home?
- Next week.
- That's nice.
I'll be glad to see your father.
Surprise!
All right. Hey. Smile.
Wait, wait. One second.
OK.
What's in here?
It's probably very expensive.
I bet I know who that's from.
My God. Phil won't be able
to keep his hands off me.
You need it.
I got to go.
You're seeing the professor.
Have a good time.
I'm so nervous.
I need that "A."
Leaving so soon?
Right. Look, cover for me
if my folks call.
I told them
I was going to stay over.
Sure, absolutely.
Don't be surprised if you don't
hear from me until Sunday.
Oh, my God. I won't be.
- Bye-bye.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
- And thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye. Good-bye, Joyce.
Oh, God,
he's going to love this.
What do you got?
You got something?
Yeah.
Middle-aged man...
Killed and robbed
over in Westfield.
So?
I'm not interested
in middle-aged men, Frank.
This guy kills brides...
young brides.
All right, Frank,
give me the rest of it.
It was at a bridal shop.
That's him. I'm on my way.
I'm going to call them
and tell them you're coming.
You tell them I'm coming.
Don't tell them anything else.
Len, I got to tell them
something.
Frank, give me some time.
Now, wait a minute.
I'm looking
at trouble here, Len.
You know what I'm saying?
And you know how badly
I want him.
What happens
if you don't get him?
- I'll get him.
- What happens if you don't?
I'll get him!
Thirty-six hours.
Thanks, Frank.
Tell 'em not to touch anything.
Not a damn thing.
What's going on here?
Sit down.
You remember the Carlton case?
Joann Carlton?
No, you wouldn't remember.
You weren't even here.
A bride was killed...
an hour before her wedding.
Len was going to marry her.
Now, he goes nuts
for quite a while.
He spends three years
tracking this psycho.
The guy's leaving a trail
of bodies behind him.
Sure you made it?
You seen Marvin around lately?
Seen him around?
I can't get rid of the guy.
You know, the closer
it gets to my wedding...
the bigger pain he gets to be.
Tell him to get lost.
I can't. I like him.
Maybe you should marry him
instead of Phil.
And spend the rest of my life
joking about dead bodies?
No, thank you.
There's this real cute guy
I see jogging every morning.
Yeah?
He stares at me all the time.
So why don't you let him
pick you up?
No, I couldn't do that.
Why not?
You think I should?
Definitely.
I don't know.
OK, I will.
Good.
So, here's to you
and the jogger.
No! Stay away from me.
I won't do it in the kitchen.
Come back in here.
You shouldn't have done that
this afternoon.
Done what?
Don't you play
Miss Innocent with me.
You could've gotten
my wife suspicious.
You know,
I was thinking about...
what you were telling us
in class last week.
You mean you actually
learned something?
I sure did.
I think we ought to have
a Platonic relationship.
You're kidding.
No.
Don't believe that bullshit.
- But you said that Plato...
- It's all bullshit.
- Plato was bullshit?
- Philosophy is bullshit.
- Oh.
- Now, this...
is what it's all about.
Joyce.
Joyce!
Where are you?
I don't like the dark, Joyce.
You come any closer,
and I'll jump.
We've been playing around
for an hour.
Aw, poor Carl.
Damn right!
Poor Carl will start playing
with himself in a minute...
if you don't
stop fooling around.
I thought you wanted me
to start fooling around.
You know what I mean.
Come on,
let's do it on the table.
I told you,
the table's too hard.
No, it's not.
That's easy for you to say.
I'm the one on the bottom.
- I got you now.
- Carl...
What are you going to do?
Huh?
What are you going to do?
Come on,
it's spooky out here!
Oh, yeah? I'm going to leave you
out there a little longer.
What are you going to do now?
You going to cut it out?
- Yes!
- Yeah? You promise? Promise?
- Yes!
- Promise?
Gonna do it on the table?
I'll do it on the table,
you son of a bitch!
You sure?
Oh, I'll kill you.
I'm going to give you an "F"!
Bitch.
Oh, that hurt.
Now...
All right.
Hold it.
What now?
Now, you wouldn't
give me an "F"...
would you, Professor?
Well?
An "A" plus.
Come on up here. Come on.
Did you hear something?
- No.
- Maybe it's your wife.
She won't be back until Monday.
You sure?
What was that?
The darkness.
- Stop it, Carl.
- Oh, brother.
What happened to the lights?
It was probably just a fuse.
Come on.
- Go see what it is.
- I don't want to!
- Go check it out.
- It's dark out there!
Listen, brave one,
you ain't getting nothing...
until the lights get back on.
Nothing?
Zilch.
Oh, shit!
You better be here
when I get back.
What happened?
I fell.
Don't hurt yourself!
Thanks.
That's it.
Forget it.
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.
It's too damned dark down there.
No lights. Weird sounds.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
I've come to suck your blood.
Hey...
What the heck?
Who is it?
The bogeyman.
Marvin.
Marvin.
Joe sent me.
What are you doing here?
Well, you said come by at 7:00.
Not 7:00 in the morning.
There you go, Syd.
It's your new home.
Give him room, you guys.
I just got off work.
They got me
on night shift again.
Why are you
still bringing me fish?
Remember what I told you
when I gave you this tank?
Mm-hmm.
Every time you visit me...
you're going to bring me a fish.
Correct.
Well, I'm visiting you...
and that's a fish.
That's dumb, Marvin.
That's really dumb.
Besides, I'm sick of goldfish.
Marry me,
and I'll bring you a piranha.
That's a tempting offer,
but I'll pass.
How about if I cried?
Oh, Marvin.
You know, there are
plenty of other girls...
that would love to go out
with you. Lorna, for one.
She only wants me for my body.
How about if I begged?
Please?
Just give it a rest, Marvin.
So, tell me...
is it true what
I've been hearing on campus?
What have you been hearing
on campus?
That you dumped Phil.
You don't give up, do you?
I did once.
January 5, 1973.
You remember Mary O'Connor?
The Virgin Mary.
That's the one.
I took her
to the drive-in movie.
She said no, and I stopped.
I believed her.
But you've always
been a gentlemen, Marvin.
It was the biggest mistake
I ever made.
Later I found out she was
saying no to everybody...
a couple of times
before giving in.
But I've said no
more than a couple of times.
Well, maybe I haven't asked
the question enough.
Would you like some coffee?
No, not for me.
It's no good for you.
You ought to see
what it does to the liver.
It makes me sick
just to think about it.
You know El Exigente...
the guy
that drinks all the coffee?
He has no liver.
It's a liver destroyer.
We had this one stiff
we opened about a week ago...
Marvin?
His liver looked like
it'd been punched...
- Marvin!
- What?
- Don't you want to hear...
- Marvin? Look outside.
OK, I looked.
He's gone.
Who's gone?
That man.
What man?
That man who's following me.
He's gone.
Amy, why would anybody
want to follow you?
I don't know.
But now he knows where I live.
Wait just a second.
Oh, Marvin.
I didn't see anybody.
I'm scared, Marvin.
Hey, if I'd have known
it was this easy...
I would've scared you
a long time ago.
You don't believe me.
You think
I imagined the whole thing.
Amy, there wasn't anybody
out there.
Yes, there was.
No.
Can't a girl get any sleep
around here?
- Hello, Marvin.
- Hi.
Did somebody die?
How you doing, Nance?
I've got an awful hangover.
Are you making coffee?
- Yeah.
- Good. I need it.
We're not going
to run today, are we?
Yeah, of course we are.
We've got to meet
that friend of yours.
Oh, yeah. I'll probably
throw up all over him.
What's wrong with you?
Hey, Marvin.
I think I ate
too much cake last night.
This is some lively group.
I think I got to go.
We're going to
the amusement park later.
Would you like to come?
Oh, I wish I could...
but I'm dissecting a cat
in biology later this week.
I need to pick up a few strays
so I can practice.
That's what everybody says.
Amy, if you need me,
you know where to reach me.
Thanks, Marv.
You haven't
called me that since...
Take care.
I'm Gamble. "Daily Globe."
Oh, yes. They're in the back.
They're waiting for you.
Are you Gamble?
Took you long enough.
I'd like to know what the hell's
going on around here.
I got the guys from the lab
hanging around doing nothing...
the reporters
crawling all over my back...
and I gotta wait for you.
Look, we didn't touch nothing.
The guy cleaned out
the cash register.
I don't understand
why the hell...
you're so damn interested
in an open and shut case.
It's a simple
robbery and murder.
Look, pal, you wouldn't be
holding back on me, would you?
Detective Thompson, you got
a mess of people outside.
They want to know
what's going on.
Take care of them.
Let's go out there.
"Amy Jensen."
Those guys are
always down my throat.
- Listen...
- The name's Thompson.
Thompson.
Anybody else work here?
Yeah, the dead guy's wife.
Find her.
She might be able to help.
And what are
you going to be doing?
Sleeping. I had a long drive.
He's a big help.
You know I don't have
the time now.
There he is! See him?
That's your victim?
- Yeah. Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go get him?
- Go on!
- OK. I'll see you later.
I'm too tired to scream from
the pain you just caused me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
I stretched out an extra foot
to make sure I'd trip you.
Why'd you do that?
Well, it seemed
the best way to meet you.
- Oh.
- My name's Elliot.
Hi. How do you do?
I'm Nancy.
I hate jogging.
So do I.
I know who
the next girl is, Frank.
Never mind how.
I just know who it is.
All I have to do is wait for her
to lead me to him.
Frank, it's my case.
Leave them out of it.
Too bad they don't have
a roller coaster.
Thank God for small things.
Don't you like to be scared, Am?
No.
Most people do, actually.
I mean, like to be scared.
It's something primal,
something basic.
Horror movies
and the roller coasters...
and the House of Horror rides.
I want to go on that next!
And you can face death
without any real fear of dying.
It's safe.
You can leave the movie...
or get off the ride
with a vicarious thrill...
and the feeling
that you just conquered death.
One hell of a first class rush.
Don't tell me.
You're a psych major.
Good deductive guess.
I'm most interested in fear,
the emotion of fear.
For example,
why, after seeing "Psycho"...
were so many people afraid
to take showers?
Not me.
I never saw the movie.
You were afraid, right?
You bet.
Fear fascinates me.
People pay to be scared.
And when you think about it...
it's really ridiculous.
Give me some.
Ridiculous. That's the word
I was looking for.
Amy's been a little edgy lately.
She's getting married
in two weeks.
And she thinks some maniac's
following her around.
Oh. Guilt.
Freud would have
a field day with that.
You see? Now you have
a professional opinion.
- Thank you.
- Is he a big man?
Let's just forget about it, OK?
No, no. Answer my question.
Is he a big man?
Yes.
Definitely sexual.
Let's just change the subject,
all right?
Have you seen this man
while you were with us?
- No.
- And you won't.
The hallucination
will only manifest itself...
when you're alone.
How far are you in psych?
Psych One.
Introduction to Psychology.
An expert.
Want a Goober?
No, thanks.
Come on.
Come on, Am.
- What do you want?
- I want cotton candy.
Cotton candy.
OK, one cotton candy.
- Hey, you got any change?
- Are you serious?
Here you go.
You like that?
No, all I have is a five.
- How much is this?
- $4.00.
We'll take it.
I want you to have this.
Thank you.
And I want you
to have this, too.
- Now I owe you four.
- You sure?
Come on, let's go
No, thank you.
Hey, Amy?
I think we'll skip this one.
What, do you want to leave?
Yeah.
I'll meet you back home, OK?
Sure. Have a real good time.
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.
Say, have you got a dime?
What for?
Well, I want
to call my roommate...
and have him
vacate the premises.
Why?
Well, I thought
we'd play a game of backgammon.
I don't like to play games.
Oh, god. That was scary.
Come on, Am!
I have two more tickets!
No, really. This is silly.
Come on, let's go.
Please? Come on.
- It's just a ride.
- All right, come on.
If you're scared, Amy,
you can hold onto me.
Oh, my God! No!
Oh, my God! No!
Oh, my God!
Boy, that was great.
Let's do it again.
Huh?
No, let's... Come on.
Amy, come on!
Now, come on.
Hey, Phil, come on!
We're waiting for you!
Let's go!
Hey, Phil, get me a beer.
Hey, did you get that thing?
Come on! Hey, put it back!
Come on, put it back.
Hey, Phil, come on!
Come on, Amy.
Answer the phone.
Yeah, he's on the phone.
Hey, Phil, come on!
Hey, Phil, I'm waiting for you!
Are you really
going to marry that turkey?
I don't like Phil.
Marry Marvin. I like him.
He makes me laugh and helps me
with my homework.
Sometimes Phil helps me
with my homework...
and he gives me
the answers all wrong.
Besides,
Phil's younger brother...
is even a bigger asshole
than he is.
Hi, Nance. How's Elliot?
He's fine.
- We saved you a burger.
- No, thanks.
Elliot's taking me out
to dinner tonight.
Why don't you run upstairs
and get your knapsack?
It's almost time for me
to take you to that party.
Oh, OK.
I saw him again, Nancy.
- What, that man?
- Yeah.
When?
Today at the amusement park.
He must've followed me there.
I saw him
after you and Elliot left.
Amy, are you sure
this is the same man?
Of course I'm sure.
Look, I'm gonna cancel my plans
with Elliot tonight.
Oh, no, that's silly.
You don't have to do that.
I know I don't have to,
but I want to.
Amy, I'm worried about you.
I'm ready!
You'll be here when I get back?
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
- Just hurry back, OK?
- I will.
Amy? Diane?
You two forget something?
See you tomorrow.
You goddamn idiot!
Can't you see the one-way sign,
for crying out loud?!
You come down the street
any way you like? You're a dope!
I'm a cop, for Christ's sakes!
Here, here!
Come on, you idiot!
Ah, jerk bastard!
Shit!
Amy?
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, God.
No! No!
The keys... Where are the keys?
Oh, no!
No! Oh, my God!
No! Keys!
Get the fucking keys!
No!
The keys, the keys.
God damn it!
He scores!
Yeah, it's a tie ball game
once more.
And now looking
for the 2-3 zone.
- Oh! Marvin!
- Amy!
Amy, what is it?
What's the matter?
He's after me, Marvin.
He's trying to kill me.
He killed Nancy.
Wait, wait.
What are you talking about?
The man that
I saw through the window.
Do you remember?
He's after me.
He's trying to kill me.
Amy, we've been through
all this before.
Nobody's after you.
Nobody's trying to kill you.
There's nobody...
Oh, shit.
You mean this whole thing's
been on the level?
Yes. What are we going to do?
Do?
You call the police,
and I'll go check it out.
- I'll be right back.
- Marvin, please be careful.
You don't have to tell me that.
I'll be right back.
Call the cops.
Sure.
Marvin?
This is Gamble.
Get me Thompson.
I'm at the residence
of an Amy Jensen.
That's at 242 Warden.
There's been a homicide.
- Did you say Jensen?
- That's right.
An Amy Jensen
just called from the morgue...
and said that someone
was trying to kill her.
Where the hell
is the goddamn morgue?
It's on Walnut and South Street.
All you have to do...
Marvin?
Marvin?
No!
No!
No!
Get out of here.
Go on, get out of here!
Come on.
Come on, you're all right.
Get out of here. Come on!
Go, go, go. Get out.
Get out of here!
Go on! Go on!
He's in there!
He's downstairs!
It's OK.
It's all right.
It's over now.
She's so cute.
All right. Now just...
Hi.
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold it.
OK.
Nervous?
Nah.
Don't worry.
Hey, I'm ready.
Phil...
what are you doing here?
