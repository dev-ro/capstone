But he knew                     
all about Santa Claus.

    It's almost 4:30, honey.    
    We're gonna be at Grandpa's 
    pretty soon.                
- What time                     
  does Santa Claus come?        
- Not until everyone is asleep. 
            Can't I stay up     
            and see him?        
    I wouldn't if I were you.   
    It's naughty to stay up     
    past your bedtime.          
    What if we don't get home   
    by my bedtime?              
We will, hon. Don't worry.      
Santa Claus is gonna bring you  
a big surprise tonight.         
You just wait and see.

- Santa Claus!

             Come on.           
             Let's go back now. 
             Andy, stop it!     
             Please, Andy. No!  
[ Screams ]                     
                    [ Laughs ]  
        - No!                   
        - [ Screams ]           
                [ Shouting ]    
                Naughty!        
     [ Gagging ]                
                 You bastard.   
                 You're crazy.  
    Get the hell away from me!  
        Did you hear something? 
I didn't hear anything,         
Mr. Simms. Must have            
been your imagination.          
        - [ Screaming ]         
        - Punishment is good!   
    I heard something, by God.  
            [ Whimpering ]      
            No.                 
            [ Gasps ]           
        Anybody in here?        
[ Bells Jingling ]              
                [ Jingling ]    
            Mr. Simms.          
        [ Train Whistle Blows ] 
            Mr. Simms!          
Come out here and see this.     
This is lovely.                 
        Mr. Simms, are you      
        hiding in there?        
        [ Screaming ]           
                Answer.         
        Operator.               
                Thank God.      
                    [ Screams ] 
             No!                
        [ Screams ]             
    But it wasn't his fault.    
        It couldn't be.         
    Then whose fault was it?    
    It was that bitch Superior. 
    - She made him do it.       
    - Was Billy being naughty?  
            No.                 
        They were naughty.      
He punished the bad ones.       
[ Bloom ]                       
How did he know                 
who the bad ones were?          
[ Ricky ]                       
He didn't have                  
to look very far.               
            Oh, shit.           
    What?                       
    [ Sighs ]                   
    Sorry, Tommy. I gotta       
    go upstairs for a minute.   
    What for?                   
        Um, the cat             
        wants to come inside.   
How do you know?                
        I heard her collar      
        jingling at the door.   
        Uh--                    
- [ Cat Meows ]                 
- There you are, you bad kitty. 
        - Punish!

                 [ Grunting ]   
    What are you doing?         
    No! No!                     
[ Crying ]                      
        Punish. Punish!         
[ Cat Meows ]                   
        Holy shit.              
            Denise?             
        Are you okay?           
    If this is some kind        
    of joke, I'm gonna kill her.
            [ Grunts ]          
[ Dialing, Ringing ]            
Operator.                       
        Operator!               
Operator, I need the police.    
Dial 911 for emergency--        
[ Operator ]                    
Sir, is this a joke?            
        Punish.                 
            [ Gasping ]         
[ Grunts ]                      
        Punish.                 
                No!             
[ Bloom ]                       
But the others were innocent.   
[ Ricky ]                       
Oh, no. They deserved it.       
    But no one understood.      
    Not even the police.        
[ Man ]                         
Can you believe this?           
It's Christmas eve,             
and we got orders               
to bring in Santa Claus.        
            Hey, look.          
            What are you doing? 
            What do you think   
            you're doing?       
         Hold it!               
         Stop right there!      
            Daddy.              
        Daddy?                  
[ Ricky, Narrating ]            
Daddy almost got                
his present early.              
[ Siren Wailing ]               
But Billy was miles away.       
It was something to see.        
Cops stopping every Santa       
between here and the state line.
[ Siren Wailing ]               
But that didn't matter          
to Billy.                       
He knew the roads--             
the shortcuts.                  
He knew exactly                 
where he was going.             
And nothing was gonna stop him. 
At least not for long.          
Look at this hill.              
Virgin, man.                    
                The only kind   
                you'll ever get.
I'm going down first.           
    What's the matter?          
    You afraid?                 
        Be quiet for a minute.  
I feel like somebody's          
watching me.                    
                Like who?       
            Well, if it isn't   
            Bob and Mack.       
Now why don't you guys just     
get the fuck out of the way?    
            Glad to, little man.
            But, uh, we're gonna
            go sledding.        
Oh, that's the plan.            
                    Yeah.       
                    [ Grunts ]  
All right.                      
 All right. I'm sorry.          
            Now get out of here!
        Come on.                
                Go on.          
                Get out of here.
                Yeah.           
All right.                      
 All right. Let's go.           
                You go first.   
        Oh, okay.               
[ Bells Jingling ]              
    - Hey, what if I hit a tree?
    - Just go.                  
Yeah.                           
    Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!           
Whoa!                           
         All right.             
         Now watch this.        
[ Shouting ]                    
        [ Shouting, Laughing ]  
    [ Screaming ]               
            Aaah!               
            Oh, God!            
[ Ricky, Narrating ]            
Billy hated bullies.            
But he was starting             
to leave a bloody trail.        
    Three more murders.         
             I'm alerting my men
             all night.         
    Kid may be nuts,            
        but he's not stupid.    
There oughta be a way           
we can predict his next move.   
        Oh, my Lord.            
         Sister Margaret had it 
         all figured out.       
     She always knew the score. 
            But Mother Superior 
            called the shots.   
It's fairly obvious             
where he was going.             
    Really?                     
    Well, maybe you were        
    just jerking off here then. 
        - Huh?                  
        - If you say so.        
You're good, Doc,               
but I know all the moves.       
I could squash you              
like a bug.                     
    - You don't scare me.       
    - [ Chuckling ]             
      Not yet.                  
            [ Chattering ]      
            I want those papers 
            folded and stacked. 
And I want each one of you      
to write a nice "thank you"     
to Santa for his visit later.   
         [ Siren Wailing ]      
If any of you get wet           
or start to feel cold,          
come back inside.               
[ Children Chattering,          
  Laughing ]                    
                Wow.            
            Cut it out!         
            See who's coming?   
            Billy?              
    [ Siren Wailing ]           
This is Officer Barnes.         
I'm approaching                 
the orphanage now.              
                Shit!           
        All right, hold it!     
        Don't take another step 
        or I'll shoot!          
        - Billy.                
        - Get away from him!    
        Billy.                  
Oh, my God.                     
Children, inside!               
Hurry!                          
[ Children Chattering ]         
    Ricky!                      
Come away from there.           
        - One problem.          
        - It wasn't Billy.      
It was old man Kelsey,          
the janitor.                    
Poor, deaf son of a bitch.      
Mother Superior                 
was pretty pissed off.          
I guess the cop kind of         
felt bad about it too.          
I couldn't give a shit.         
I knew Billy'd                  
take care of him.               
            He was dressed      
            as a Santa Claus.   
I'm sorry for what happened,    
but there is a killer           
on the way here.                
            Oh, the children.   
            No harm must come   
            to the children.    
            Do you understand?  
- That's why I'm here, Sister.  
- I am Mother Superior.         
     And so far,                
     all you have done is harm. 
I'm gonna check out the grounds.
In the meantime, make sure      
everyone stays inside.          
    Don't let anybody come in   
    unless you know             
    exactly who it is.          
    No one is going to get in   
    that doesn't belong here.

     [ Siren Wailing ]          
    Poor things.                
    They're scared to death.    
        Hmm?                    
Oh, yes.                        
    They need something         
    to keep their mind off it.

        - [ Girl ]              
          It's Santa.           
    - Chrissie, stay away!      
    - But Mother Superior--     
        - Chrissie.             
        - It's Santa Claus.     
             Stay away from him.
Come here.                      
Andrew,

    - There is no Santa Claus.

        Santa Claus...          
        is gone.                
     [ Adult Ricky's Voice ]    
     Naughty.                   
        Very naughty.           
So,                             
this is me, huh?                
[ Scoffs ]                      
    They closed the orphanage   
    after that.                 
        You bet.                
But kindly Sister Mary          
was able to find me a family.   
    The Rosenbergs.             
    [ Scoffs ]                  
They definitely did not         
get involved with Christmas.    
[ Projector Whirring ]          
The sister gave them my...      
background.                     
And they treated me okay.       
I was finally able              
to act like a kid.              
Not some freak show             
with a killer for a brother.    
It wasn't bad.                  
Hell, what did I know?
