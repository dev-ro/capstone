Leo...
Leopoldo!
Juan José...
Leo!
Leopoldo, who did this?
Come...
...come honey.
Do not be afraid, come.
I'll take care of you.
That's it. Come.
There you go.
No!
Blood of Christ,
blood of Christ protect me...
...blood of Christ protect me,
blood of Christ protect me...
...blood of Christ protect me, blood of Christ,
blood of Christ protect me.
Leopoldo!
Leo!
Oh my God! My dear God.
The House of the end of the times
Dulce Alida de los Angeles,
due to the charges and evidences against you as
the murderess of the citizen Juan José Hernandez
And his son Leopoldo Hernéndez you are found guilty
and sentenced to the maximum prison sentence.
30 years later.
November 2011.
Thirty years and it still the same.
I took the time to tidy it up.
Inside you have food, electricity, water.
At least you will be more comfortable here
Dulce face it, this is a benefit
that law gives women your age.
Enough! Stop running!
Slow down!
Breathe!
Rodrigo hurry up!
Well. Why are you guys in such a hurry?
Do not fool around. Do not forget to
do your homework! Did you hear?
And don't you dare to be late.
And do not come all dirty,
because the one who
washes and iron is me!
And I don't want neighbors to walk around saying:
Look, that lady has two little animals. No way!
Oh if you dare to be late,
I swear on my mother's holy that I will...
Hey you kids...!
Blessing!
Blessing!
God bless you!
Good afternoon.
How are you doing?
I am the Father's Parish.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I heard the news that you were coming back,
so I came to welcome you.
Thank you.
May I come in?
I'd like to talk to you.
Why are you here for father?
I stopped believing long time ago.
I came to bring the word
of God to this home.
Let's get to the point.
Tell me,
what are looking for?
Do you know what I love the
most about being a priest?
Living without touching a woman?
To see the kids smiling.
Five years ago we founded
the Hand of God Orphanage.
To see the smile of a child that has
just tried the flavor of garbage,
is like looking God with our own eyes.
Mrs. Dulce...
I know all the sins they said you
have committed here, in this house.
But God has spoken to me
and I refuse to believe that
a mother who has seen her children smile,
could be able to take their lives away.
What is this place?
I asked myself that same question
as soon as I get in this house.
Here is where all happened?
Here is where I saw one of
my children for the last time.
Who did this?
The police found you near your husband's body
and it was also blood of the child.
Your fingerprints were on the knife.
Who did it Dulce?
Come on...
...you can trust me.
The house did it.
What?
I did not touch that knife...
...they did it. The intruders.
They kill my husband
and took away my child.
The police could never find him
and they think I killed him.
Did you bring the stuff?
Did you drink the water?
Come on, let's go!
One, two, Three!
It is so little!
Run! Take the base! Take it!
Gut!
Sir, Sir... Do you know where is...?
Where is what girl?
Where is...?
- Where is the son of a bitch!!
- Run!
Sarai! Sarai! Sarai!
Get the hell out of here!
You are stinky!
- What is wrong with you?-What is wrong with what?
Whoever messes with Sarai,
messes with me.
And what about you?
Now you have a crush on Sarai?
Because you are too little kid
So what?
Are you jealous, fool?
You crossed the line!
Get it! Get it!
Move! Get it Rodrigo!
Get it Rodrigo! Get it Rodrigo!
And now what?
Now get those buttocks ready.
What did I say?
What did I say to you Leopoldo?
It is time get you homework done.
Do you want to tell something?
Tell me! There's something you
want to tell me Leopoldo?
You let Rodrigo
sleep over in your room...
Don't you dare to answer me!
You are the older one and
you must be the role model.
Mommy...
Tell me.
I love you so much.
Mommy...
Tell me...
I am hungry.
Now I have nothing cooked.
Tomorrow I'll prepare something.
When I finish, I can get to your room?
You are a big boy now Leopoldo.
But mommy...
I have told you so many times,
that the only ones here are
your little brother, you, me... and dad
What is it?
A moon, a magic stone.
Yes, sure...
Yes, it is.
And what is this for?
Whenever you feel afraid,
hold it tight and I'll take care of you.
Really?
Have I ever lie to you?
Are you going to do it?
The blessing?
Bless me mom.
God bless you, protect you, do good for you
and make you a good man, strong, big, intelligent.
And baseball player!
And baseball player.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Put out that thing .
Today Cheo asked me
to help him with the truck,
we had to stay up late,
sorry I didn't tell you.
Do you know what I don't forgive?
What?
That my children go
to sleep empty stomach.
I brought some for the week,
sleep quietly.
I am doing my best Dulce.
You know it's not easy
for an old man to get a job.
More excuses.
Let's wait for that job.
Things will get better
More promises?
Give me a chance.
It is not me Juan José.
It is your children.
Let see if tomorrow you can
fix the light, or do something.
I miss those days Dulce.
And I miss those days that never came.
Get out of here Juan José!
Leopoldo! I told you already
to get your homework done!
Who is this?
Daddy?
Leo!
Leopoldo stop being annoying!
Who is there? Who?
Who is there?
I am calling the pélice!
Leopoldo!
Leopoldo open the door!
Leopoldo open the door!
The other key!
What did just happen?
Tell me! What happened?
Who did you see? Tell me!
Why did you scream?
I didn't do it!
Rodrigo!
What happened?
Nothing mommy.
Why did you scream?
Leopoldo scared me.
Now tell me the story once again.
Who got into the house?
I do not know.
Someone tried to get into my bedroom sir.
Did you see his face?
Any detail that you can remember?
I did not see anything.
I was locked up into my bedroom.
I did not see anything.
And you never came
out of your bedroom?
Yes.
And what happened?
It wasn't there... It was gone.
Do you think I am crazy?
Come down lady.
These are routine questions relevant to the case.
Now, how much time do you
have living in this house?
Five years.
Five years living on
this roof that is falling apart.
Why did you move here?
This house was long time abandoned,
the Government put it on sale,
and I got it for a good price.
And now we are paying that price.
It's amazing how people lose
the gift of gratitude just like that. Isn't it?
And this is the first time
something like this happen?
I think my son saw something last night.
But he doesn't want to talk.
What happened kid?
Did you see someone in the house?
Leo...
The inspector is asking you a question.
Do not be afraid, we'll take care of you all.
Leopoldo.
LeolJ°lP°!
Do not worry lady, don't push him.
Tell me something,
Do you have problems with somebody?
Do you know about someone
wanting to stay with the house?
No, no... We have never had
problems with anyone in town.
And where were you last night?
I was at the bar next to the corner.
A last question.
Did you know the people
who used to live here?
Do you know something about them?
Well, I think it is enough so far.
Here is my card.
Thank you.
Mommy...
I did see her. She talked to me.
Who?
Who did you see?
She asked me to tell you something.
What I?
But do not be afraid.
Tell me!
She said I can not play with Rodrigo.
What else did she say?
Tell me, what else did she say?!
But do not get scared.
All right, I am not afraid. Tell me!
She asked me to give you this.
What it says?
What it says mommy?
Nothing.
Mom...
Why can't I play with Rodrigo?
What happened honey?
Mom and dad will take care of you.
Do not worry.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,
...deliver us from evil.

Woman kills his family
in mysterious house.
Family disappears in their house.
Police investigate the odd disappearance
of the Eckhart's family.
Saturday, November 15th, 1921
Missing José Avilez and Soraya Rodriguez.
The neighbors are scared,
thirty years ago similar events occurred when the
Eckhart's an English family resident in our country,
disappeared under strange conditions.
Police!
Get out of my house!
Gut!
What happened?!
The great architect eye.
House founded by lrahim Eckhart.
Title deed.
Good afternoon.
Bless me father.
May God bless and protect you.
What are you doing?
It is going to rain cats and dogs.
Did you hear me?
I know today is not visiting day brother, but in
the name of the Lord I need to talk to the prisoner,
it will only take a couple of...
Do not worry, you can come any time you want.
You know what that lady need is help.
Why? Did something happen?
She is losing her mind, now she says
she can see dead people.
A ghost, a fucking ghost.
He was the one who wrote that on the mirror?
How he looks like?
An old man... with a knife in his hand.
The damn man had a knife in his hand.
I do not know what to say.
You come to my house to talk about a God,
but you have no head to hear ghost's stories right?
I was researching about the house Mrs. Dulce
and this house was built nearly a century ago.
The founder of this house,
lrahim was an English Mason,
as I read, the man came from Europe, obsessed
about building this house specifically in this place
because he said that here he will
find the absolute truth of our creation.
And then what happened?
One by one, lrahim and his family were disappearing
of this house without explanation.
With passing of time, the Government's claim it as
property, and began to offer it to people in need,
but sooner than later, they all disappear again.
Mrs. Dulce...
...tell me what happened here.
Do you want coffee?
Are you mad at me Juan José?
Why do you ask?
For nothing.
Did you see the kids downstairs?
Yes.
I let them go out and play on the block.
No!! They shouldn't be together Juan José!
They just can't!
Dulce...
Can you tell what the hell is going on?
Tell me!
I told you already...
Something is happening here!
Something very evil!
Dulce! We have five years now living in this house,
and I have never seen anything!
Leopoldo saw her too!
She gave him this!
JUAN JOSE WILL KILL YOUR SON
Who wrote this?
I thought you were going to tell me.
Don't you give me that look.
I didn't write that!
All right!
Whatever!
What are you doing?
I can not stay here any longer.
Stop making things up and
stay in your house okay?
I want to get divorced.
And what are you going to do?
Where do you want to go?
Do you have money?
We sell the house and you give me the half.
Today I'm leaving with my kids.
What did I do wrong?
Tell me.
What did I do wrong?
You are making this entire
thing up, aren't you!?
Look Juan José,
we are over long time ago.
I will see what I can do,
I'll start to sew, I'm not sick, I'll see!
My kids do not leave this house.
If you want take your bags and sleep
under a bridge but my children are staying.
Let me go... Let me go!
Do you think they're going to give you the custody?
Huh? Do you think so?
Keep on believing!
And do you know why?
Because the only one who has put a piece
of bread on the mouth of those children is me!
Let me go!
I'll let you go,
but if you take away my boys, and swear by
your holy mother I find you.
And you're not going to see them any more!
Do you understand?
Do you understand?!
Well, so what for did
you bring me here?
I brought you a gift.
Hey you! This is not my birthday!
But you have to close your eyes
What is this?
This is a little moon. If someday you feel afraid
hold it tight and I'll take care of you.
You look prettier this way
Rodrigo!
- What?
- Come, let's play!
- I'm coming! Do you want to come?
- You go first. I'll catch you later.
Rodrigo!
What?
Do you want to be my boyfriend?
We are already, aren't we?
Yes? Go on then! All right!
Look who is coming there!
The little one!
Go! You are strike out!
You are strike out jerk!
One two three! One two three!
Run! Come on, come on! Get it!
Aha! Throw it!
Stay!
Excuse me Lady; do you know
where the house of the fortuneteller is?
This is Victoria.
She wants to meet you.
Nice to meet you Dulce.
She cannot see me?
My sister should have died
many years ago in an accident
but thanks to the divine work,
she got caught between two worlds.
Now her eyes cannot
see anything material,
but they can see beyond time.
Victoria knows you need us Dulce.
Now tell us.
What brought you to this house?
Mrs. Dulce, give me that paper.
Mrs. Dulce, listen to me very carefully
it is very important,
it's very important that
you close your eyes
and whatever you listen, do not open your eyes.
Do you understand?
Why?
Sometimes our own eyes
are our worst enemies.
Why do you say that?
Because it doesn't
let us see beyond.
Victoria will connect with the dead
and with me and you must help us.
What should I do?
You must believe only on what you listen,
if you open your eyes, the dead will go.
Now...
It is so cold.
Quiet; do not open your eyes.
What?! What was that?!
Do not open your eyes Dulce.
Just listen but do not open your eyes.
Calm down...
Daddy... What are you doing?
Who?! Who is that?!
It is Victoria. She made contact.
I am not your dad.
Daddy don't say that.
I told you already, you're not my son.
- Daddy forgive me.
- Shut up!
I told you! Don't call me dad again!
My only son was Rodrigo José Hernéndez!
And you...
Daddy forgive me,
don't kill me...
Don't kill me!
Get out of my house!
Mrs. Dulce!
Out! Get out of my house!
Calm down Mrs. Dulce! Breathe!
You are! You want to scare me!
Get it! Get it!
Come on Leopoldo!
Come on, come on!
Cheer up, come on!
Get it Chuo! Throw it, throw it!
Get it, get it!
Gut!
Well done Sarai!
Rodrigo! Rodrigo! Stand up!
Boy gets some help! Run!
Help! Ask for help! Ask for help!
Don't stand still there, help me! He's your brother!
There is a time for everything,
and a time to every purpose under the sun.
Today...
November 11
there is a time to be born,
and a time to die,
a time to kill and a time to heal,
a time to tear down and a time to build,
a time to cry and a time to laugh,
a time to embrace and
a time to break away,
a time to keep silence,
and a time to speak,
a time to love and a time to hate,
a time for war and a time for peace.
Mario...
Now you are my only brother.
Do not leave me alone.
Never, I swear to God, never.
2011, November.
There is no need Dulce. Don't do it.
Thirty years father, thirty years ago
I buried one of my sons.
Thirty years locked up in a jail tolerating blows,
insults,
humiliations.
And I survived, I survived with the
only hope to find my other son alive,
but I have nothing to seek,
nothing to find.
Why?
Why did all this have to happen?
Some people say that the ways
of the Lord are mysterious.
Bullshit.
Father, today is not visiting day.
You hear?
True words.
Good fellow,
the other officer let me get in.
Yesterday was not a visiting day and
I let get in right? Do not abuse of me.
The lady feels very bad and in any time
something can happen to her.
No can do father.
If it depended on me, thing were different
I am afraid I can not
reconcile with God father.
Today is 11th Dulce, it is just a date,
November 11th two thousand eleven,
at the eleventh hour, eleven minutes
and eleven seconds.
One more day...
...just one more day.
Why?
Because a mother is God
in the eyes of her children. That is why.
I have just a few days to leave this world,
but my heart does not stop breathing
without the happiness you gave me.
Give our son my name but give him your
husband's lastname. Juan José is a good man...
...do not leave him.
He will be the good father that I ever will.
Every time you read this,
remember I'll be dreaming of you from the
near and distant place in the universe.
The Paradise of your heart
Leopoldo Rodriguez.
Dad!
Who is there?!
Who?!
Who is there?!
I am calling the police!
Leopoldo!
Don't be afraid.
Leopoldo open the door!
Leopoldo open the door!
The other key!
Leopoldo, look at me.
Look very close my face and listen carefully
to my voice. It is me Leo, your mom.
What is wrong Leito?
You scared me.
Have you changed your clothes,
but you smell like pure pee you pig.
Did my mom hit you?
Rodrigo little brother
A day just like today
I gave you that moon
and I told you if you ever were
afraid I was going to come and take care of you.
Don't you remember?
You are old.
Too many years passed Leito, many years.
I want you to listen to me very carefully;
I need you to do something for me.
Mommy... What is wrong?
You cannot play with Rodrigo!
Whatever it is, you cannot play with
your brother, just for three days.
Do it for me, I came here to take care
of you and your brother too.
Here, give this to your mom and
don't tell her I gave it to you.
And you cannot read it,
do not read it Leopoldo.
Your brother does not have to know about it either.
Do you promise? Do you promise?
It will be our little secret, right?
Mommy... When I grow up what I'll be?
The best baseball player ever.
Mommy when will you come back?
What happened?
Tell me! What happened?
What is this? A glass ball?
It is a little moon, hold it tight whenever you
feel afraid and I'll be here to take care of you
Can you give it to me?
Yes, yes, but come
so mommy can see you, come.
Leo!
What happened?
Nothing mommy.
Why did you scream?
Leopoldo scared me.
Who are you?
Where are you going?
Daddy I saw Rodrigo
in my bedroom, he was alive
No daddy, don't.
What are you doing?
I am not you father.
No daddy!
Don't say that!
I told already!
You are not my son!
- Daddy forgive me
- Shut up!.
And don't you ever call me father again.
My only son was
Rodrigo José Hernéndez.
And you...
Daddy forgive me.
Don't kill me! No, don't kill me!
Juan José.
Leopoldo, his name was Leopoldo.
Let's have a talk. Come.
So long time ago and he was not my son.
He is your son, come on, let's talk, come.
He is not my son, he is not my son.
Yes, yes, yes he is your son, is your son,
stop it, stop it, put that away.
Don't you touch me
What do you want ha!? Tell me!
Stop it dad! Stop it!
Blood of Christ protect me,
blood of Christ protect me.
Stop it! No, no!
Stop it daddy!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Stop it daddy!
Tell me! Who are you?
Look at my face very well Dulce,
listen well to my voice.
It is me, your son, Leopoldo.
Stop it daddy!
I come from the year 2071, I have my whole life
waiting for the house to take me to you.
How? How is it possible?
Neither the science nor the religion
has been able to find the truth.
What truth?
We're just puppets of this house
where time has come to an end.
What happened that day?
What happened to you?
That day you saved me, that day Juan José
was about to kill me, but you came just on time.
I don't understand, I didn't get on time.
Today is November 11, today the house
will take you to the year 81.
No! Why are you giving that to me?
Are you asking me to kill Juan José?
You did it once and that
was the only way to save me.
No!
There is no time left!
Just tell me how I can get back,
I could save Rodrigo too.
It is impossible to dominate
the power of this house,
this house will take us simply
to the time which is its will.
No, no!
I miss you so much.
I am so afraid, very afraid.
Listen to me my mother.
The families and masons who formerly lived in
this house appeared in the future.
They now live in a time
where they don't belong.
It is enough Leopoldo.
You must listen to me! Hold on to this knife and
it will become a part of you and your time.
When I was twelve years old, the first signs of
the disease that killed my real father appeared.
In the eighties there was no treatment
that could save me. Today you should save me,
today you must hold on to me.
Today you should take me to the year...
Who are you?!
Look my face very well,
listen carefully to my voice.
No... no.
I don't have too much time,
I have to go.
No!
Take care of your mother,
take good care of me.
Be good, always.
Leopoldo!
Mommy don't go!
Leopoldo get out of here!
Go with your other mom,
I can not take care of you any more.
Leo!
Leopoldo. Who did this?
Come, come honey.
Don't be afraid, come,
I take care of you.
I was twelve years old; the first signs of
the disease that killed my real father appeared.
In the eighties there was no
treatment that could save me.
Today you should save me,
today you must hold on to me.
No!
Blood of Christ protect me,
blood of Christ, blood of Christ protect me.
Oh my God, my dear God.
I caused all this.
Do you think I did the right thing?
Do you think God can forgive me?
Come with me.
Be careful, he is still very fragile.
Calm down Leo, calm down.
After all God has not
forgotten this house father
But I can not take care of my son any more.
The time, the time has running out of my hands.
How could an old woman take
care of her son locked up here?
Hey Father! Hey!
Hey you, Father!
Something wrong?
And that boy?
He is the son of the prisoner, he has traveled
through time and we found him in the house.
He is one of the children from the orphanage.
ls there any problem?
Can I go now?
You can go.
The symptoms have not yet appeared, but Leopold is
sick. He has inherited a heart disease.
Thirty years ago I wouldn't be able
to take care of him but now I do.
Please help me to take him to a place where he
can be adopted, a place where they can assist him.
I know the perfect place.
I miss Rodrigo.
Do you think we'll see him again?
Sure Leo.
Maybe in life, surely in death,
just when the day of Judgment arrives,
the day of the end of times.
Make him to know the beautiful
world that's out there of this house.
Make him laugh again.
Tell my son to wait for me,
I have a little time here left
Amen.
A Diony and Mamalida
the best mothers of all times.
The House of the end of the times
