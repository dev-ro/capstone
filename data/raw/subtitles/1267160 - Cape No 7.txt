December 25th, 1945
Tomoko, the sun has set
I can't see Taiwan now
Are you still waiting for me there?
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Taipei!
We can't pass through
Yes, we can
Yes, we can
No, we can't. Too low
Yes, we can. Really
Let's give it a try
Try what?
We'll get stuck. Try your ass!
Are you getting in or what?
Tomoko, come on!
Wait a minute...
Come on! We don't have all day here
Tomoko, out!
OK, sorry
Back off please
Got good light. Keep it close together
Tight together. Come on. Excellent!
Good. Keep it close. Thank you
That way!
Now, come on! Keep it close now...
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
Come on! Jeez!
Tomoko, we're trying to shoot here
What do you think you're doing?
All right, ladies. Never mind
Let's do it professionally, all right?
I want everybody in and smiling
Good!
Old Mao...
Old Mao...
Registered mail!
Come on!
A healthy young man has to work
Don't force me, please
There's no vacancy
How could it be?
Old Mao is 80 and he refuses to retire
He doesn't see you waving hands
nor hear you calling him
He can't be a mailman anymore
Hey...
You can't go swimming
You have work tomorrow and later on
What if you got sunburn?
What we want is a dip in the water
What are you hollering at?
Don't be a bitch!
Stop looking at the girls! Watch the road!
Hey! I'm also a model!
How can you do it to me?
Watch out!
What the hell are you doing?
Damn it!
I told them they'd get sunburn
They wouldn't listen. What can I do?
You don't care about anything
But you want me to be responsible
What do you want me to do?
Hey, you!
You smoked in my bathroom?
Don't you think I'll tell the manager?
Just paint it. Don't waste your time
Come on. It's done
Grandpa, he's here!
First day at work and you're late
You too
You're late for school
From Hengchun Professional School...
...to Junior High through Hengnan R. And
to Elementary School through Beiman R...
...to Zhongzheng R. And then Hsinhsing R.
This is the returned mail
Give it back tomorrow
Any question?
That's it. Go!
You're late already
Hey! You forget this!
Fuck! You're dead!
Jerk! So late on the first day!
Damn! Got me out and left me here
Where are you from?
Post office's motorcycle broke down
Fuck! I thought you were mute
Why aren't you wearing the helmet?
Driver's license, please
What about him?
And them?
And her?
And she ran through a red light too!
There are plenty of them. Why me?
Because you're in a bad luck
Driver's license!
Don't have it?
And driving without license too
What's your name?
What's your name?
What the fuck is your name?
Shameless!
Fuck!
What are you doing?
I'll kill you!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rauma, stop it!
I'll kill this motherfucker!
You're not in SWAT team anymore!
Come here!
Sorry...
You! Maintain the traffic!
Goddamn it!
What the fuck?
I'm sorry
He's in a bad mood
Are you all right?
Why don't you listen to me?
Come on!
Come on! Don't be a fool!
What's wrong?
Can't start it!
It's tricky
Why is it wrapped like this?
Wow! It's convertible!
Do you have our mails?
No!
Can you fix it or not?
All my tools are in there
Then go get it!
My owner has the keys
You arrived just now?
When'll your owner be here?
He lives in there!
Then why don't you ring the bell?
Amitabha, please...
Amitabha. I'm not Police
I'm Frog, and I have no money
I replace you?
I've been in politics longer than you
I don't replace you
I let you be the mayor first
Mayor, excuse me. This needs your stamp now
Put it on my desk
All right. Put it there
Stamps? Everything needs my stamp
Japanese singer's concert at the beach
It's Mayor's most important job
You have to learn how to do it
Mayor, if you approve this...
...all the representatives will kill you
Tomoko...
Please forgive my cowardice
I dared not admit we were in love
I even forgot how I became obsessed...
...with that rebellious girl...
...who upset me all the time
Tomoko...
You were stubborn and vain
But I couldn't help being crazy for you
You graduated from the school...
...when we lost the war
We're losers
Our aristocratism is no more
I'm nothing but a poor teacher
Why should I be the scapegoat?
I have nothing to do with the war
I'm but a poor teacher
I love you, but I have to leave you
O, Lord, let us praise together...
...and call thy name
A...
...men!
Everybody, let's pray together
Malasun!
Miss, how are you?
I have an appointment with Mr. Huang
Can you tell him I'm here?
Wait a second, please
Hello? Is Mr. Huang available now?
Miss, it's a new brand
We repackage the aborigine's millet wine
The goal is to go international
Thousands years of history with new sensation
We named it Malasun
I'll pour one for you
No, thanks...
Yes? I have a Mr...
Malasun! Ma-la-sun...
...Mr. Malasun, who says
he has an appointment with you
OK. The B1 office
B1 office. No problem
The elevator is there
Where's the general manager?
You...
Mr. Representative, can I help you?
Have a seat, Mr. Representative!
What is love?
It's nothing but a game
Honey, darling, baby or pumpkin
Whatever you call me
Which floor?
The basement
Can't you walk?
Don't you have legs?
5th floor!
Oh, I'm scared of nothing because I love you
But if you love someone else
I'll kill you for sure
Oh, I'm scared of nothing
because I love you, baby
Please indulge me to show your love
Amen!
Who says Hengchun has no talent?
Dada, why are you here?
The church is done?
Not yet
Then why are you here?
Lord kicked me out of there
Mr. Representative, why so mad?
The hotel is yours, but the sea is ours
You think rich people
can make everything BOT?
What are you talking about?
We have to go global now
It's a global village
What global village?
You outsiders build up hotels here
The lands BOT. The mountains BOT
Now the sea BOT too
What about us natives? Be employed?
- Are we living on the same Earth? - Hey!
Where are you going?
Here it is!
Open the door then!
The sea is so beautiful
Why can't people see it?
Why?
Because rich people bought it too
They left us nothing
The annual Spring Scream is in Hengchun
What about us natives?
What do we get?
We can only cheer with the crowds
And all we get is garbage everywhere
Come on! We have nothing
to do with Spring Scream
This year we invite...
...a famous singer from Japan
What's his name again?
His voice is like the sea...
I don't care if your Japanese singer...
...is going to be a doctor or a sailor
What I'm asking you...
...is to have a local warm-up band
Do you understand me?
But there's no local band here
I want gaiety this time
That's why we need killing bands
You have no such talents here
What are you talking about?
You? We?
What happened to your global village?
What do you mean?
I mean...
All right, whatever
I assure you that I can get...
...a great local band for you
No. It's impossible
Yes, it's possible
No, it's impossible!
Yes, it's possible!
Believe me when I say it's possible
Or let's run for the Mayor next year
Wait and see who will be elected
Come on! Please!
I promised those people in Taipei
Why don't you cancel it?
We've paid them. How could it be cancelled?
- Yeah! - Listen, it's all right
If you don't want a local band...
...I won't let you party at beach...
...even if I have to kidnap the Mayor
Let's go!
Wait a minute...
Listen to me, please
Do you know how much money I've spent?
I even get lots of foreign models...
...for people to take photos with
It's Integrated Marketing, you know?
I'm running for the Mayor next year
Think about it. I'll give you 1 minute
Have you heard of Kousuke Atari?
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
Wait... Wait a minute!
All right!
I'll have your band
I'll have your band
No... our band
No... our band
Ma-la-sun
Try it...
What do you think? Is your mouth...
...filled with the beautiful flavor?
Wow! You really can drink
Let me get you one more
Why?
OK. I'll be right there...
Yes?
What? They're leaving!
OK. I'll be right there!
What the hell?
I'm a model too
Why can't I go on the runway?
Why do you always ask me
to be a caretaker and an interpreter?
You're good looking
But the current fashion doesn't suit you
You look good actually
You're still young, you know?
I'm old!
I'm so upset that I age early
I stay here in Taiwan after graduation
because you said that I was special
Now you say I'm not in trend...
...and that I can only be an interpreter?
Please, don't start with me
It's an emergency. We had no choice
But it's a lifetime chance
The Japanese label doesn't believe...
...they can get proper musicians...
...in such a place like Hengchun
Do me a favor, please
Supervise everything there
Be a caretaker
Anyway, you can't ask me to stay
without asking for my consent
You can't do that
The key to Miss Tomoko's room
You know the Japanese are so picky
We don't know how to deal with them
When you speak ill of the Japanese...
...don't forget I'm Japanese too
Why should we cancel our plans?
You're late every day. Lazybones!
What do you think you're doing?
I don't work here
Schedule your route today
I'll see if it's appropriate
The 3rd day
How could I stop myself
from thinking about you?
You're a student from the sunny South
while I'm a teacher from the snowy North
We're so different
But why do we love each other so much?
I miss the sunshine and the warm winds
I remember you were upset by the ants
I know I shouldn't laugh at you
But the way you stamped on the ants...
It fascinated me
It's as if you were dancing...
...with anger and airing joyfulness
That was when I fell in love with you
Attention, everyone
We have an audition at 7:30 this evening
All those who can play any instrument
are welcome to attend
Your ID card, please
My ID card is needed?
Don't you have it?
Then how do I know if you're native
Move! Don't you see I'm limping?
Get out of my way!
This kid is impossible. Move!
Hsiang, eat it by yourself
Number 10? All right...
All right...
You're the best. Eat it by yourself
Ma'am, my friend registered for me...
...to play the drums in an audition
Okay, you're free to go
Do you want to see me performing?
Who would take care of these kids?
Take them with you then
- Do you want to go? - Yes!
Hey, you! Stop!
Stop...
Ask your people to be quiet, please
Stop the racket!
Quiet!
Quiet! Do you hear me?
Where are those 3 kids from?
Get them out of here!
Let me tell you something...
Be quiet when someone's performing
Otherwise it'd seem so rude
Old Mao!
Finished already?
Finished?
Applaud!
Number 10, it's your turn
Number 10? Shit! It's me!
Number 10...
Take care of these kids for me please
Number 10...
Number 10!
What are you doing?
Number 10! It's me!
Who's spraying water?
Sorry...
That's not water. It's saliva
You're disgusting!
I didn't think you would come
Take it
Or I will crash it
How dare you?
Well, go ahead and do it
See that?
There goes Hengchun's drum player
Go with me
Are you going on stage?
It won't hit you...
See? I told you. What are you afraid of?
Hey, Mr. Postman
Playing guitars is supposed to make you happy
Old Mao, please!
Put it away!
My wife and your father died early
My kids are working elsewhere
Your brothers are away either
Only your mother and I are left here
We're so lonely
The house is big...
...and the bed is large...
Come on!
Speaking about the house makes angry
Why should you mention the bed too?
The priest says...
...that it's not good to be alone
That was why their God created women
People are meant to be social
That's all I can say
I hope you understand
He's the only one who can play drums
You can't ask him to because of that
You don't think he's good enough?
That's not the point
What matters is
how he charms the audience on stage
But...
He looks like an insect
What insect?
You look down upon him already
Frog!
The rehearsal is 7:30 at the Hotel basement
I picked you among others
Don't let me down
Remember, put your feelings into it
Come on!
This aborigine is good at mouth organ
Mouth organs are not for a rock band
Says who? He played drums yesterday...
...and guitar and mouth organ. It was great
Everyone loved it
Ask him to play the bass guitar then
What does a mouth organ player
know about the bass guitar?
Goddamn it!
Those DoReMis are the same anyway
I bet he knows how to play them both
You think I know nothing about music?
What the hell are you doing?
You play the bass guitar
Your son plays the guitar
I don't know how to play bass guitar
It's OK. Everything will be fine
All right, that's it then
And the lead vocal...
Go get Mr. Representative's... that kid!
Wait a minute... Who's that?
Was he there yesterday?
The one who got mad playing the guitar
Can he sing?
Don't look down upon him
He was a lead vocal in a Taipei band
He can write, play and sing
How often do you meet a talent like him?
What are you complaining about?
Did I say anything?
This is men's talk
What are you moaning about?
Your tooth aches?
Why don't you see a doctor?
Ignore her. Come on...
The one who plays keyboard is too old
Old? How about this one? She's 40
Look how beautiful our sea is
Why can't young people stay here?
Tomoko, take a look at our sea...
I don't understand your dialect!
Excuse me...
7 o'clock tonight at Chateau Hotel
You'll join the band on our behalf
What about my grandpa? Is he in?
Come on! It's a rock band
Old Mao can only play yukin
Son of a bitch!
Malasun!
What did you say?
It's Malasun
Damn! It's 7:30 now
Till 9 o'clock? What's wrong with you?
Enough! I want to talk to your manager
Frog!
- Have your feelings with you? - Yeah...
Put your feelings into it, all right?
You're in it too?
I'm Frog
The drummer
Frog!
- How are you? - Frog!
When were you back?
My daughter
She's so cute
Leave her alone
I'm the drummer, your mom's friend
How do you do? I'm Frog the drummer
Insect! Go back where you came from
I'm sorry
Where's Aga?
God knows!
Forget it. Let's start the rehearsal
Rehearse what? It's our first day
Yeah, we don't have the score
and we don't know each other
Hi, I'm Hong Kuo-rong
The town council chairman
Hi, I'm Frog the drummer
I know! I picked you personally!
I'm the town council chairman
I'm 170 centimeters tall
I weigh 75 kilograms and I'm 60 years old
What I love most to do is...
...quarrel, fight, kill people and set a fire
And my ambition...
...is to burn down Hengchun...
...and to ask all the young people...
...to come back here to rebuild it
We'll be the employers, not the employees
Do we know each other now?
Yes! It hurts!
All right already! Calm down!
Yeah, calm down...
You said something too!
What are they doing downstairs? Band?
Mr. Malasun?
Can you lower your voice?
You scared me!
Here!
Do you clean the cup before
it's passed on to someone else?
Yeah
They're rehearsing now
I see
I'll report to you in a couple of days
I've informed our Taipei Office
Yeah
Yeah, I see
What the hell are you doing?
Mind your tempo
Stop fooling around!
Take your call outside!
You're getting nearer and nearer
It's next to me today
I've had enough!
Malasun!
I have and appointment
with your general manager...
Mr. Representative...
I'm Hakka in Baoli. Here's my calling card
This is our new product
Revolutionary millet wine
It's called Malasun
Age-old tradition with new sensation
This is for you. Try it please
He's waiting for you upstairs
Thank you
Mr. Representative...
I'm the only salesman in Hengchun
I'm wondering if you can help me...
...and introduce me to other hotels
My boss wants this new product...
...to be high-class
Please. Do me the favor
Baoli belongs to Checheng
This is Hengchun here
Why should I help you?
Have some pride, young man
Stop kissing someone's ass for money
Yeah, not bad
I've been watching them rehearsing
Yeah, the first song will be ready this week
The second one by this weekend
The weather's gone mad and the sea is boiling
That's why I want to seize the day
Stop wasting time
Be a skywalker...
Stop...
What?
I'm adding something here
Be a skywalker...
Amen!
All right, whatever. As you wish
One more time!
- When the sky is empty... - Wait...
After that...
...I'll try something cool. Come on!
Hey!
Can you try it after we do it once?
It's been 3 days
We haven't finish anything yet
You, with the keyboard!
Mind your tempo
The bass guitar is lagging
Drummer can't stop criticizing
What the hell do you want?
What? Stop moaning!
You look down upon us, don't you?
You're the best, all right?
Only you can say anything
What do you want?
What? Wanna fight?
I'd like to point out 3 things
First, the keyboardist is too young
...while the bass guitarist is too old
We have to find someone else
Second, you're a mess
We should rehearse more often
Third!
They want you to write 2 songs
But there's only one now...
...written by you a long time ago
But what matters is the other song
Can you do it?
Can you do it if I can't?
I'm not in charge here
Ride to hell!
Aga...
When are you normally off duty?
Around 5 o'clock
5 o'clock?
You're fast, aren't you?
Put the mails inside the mailbox
to avoid them being stolen
I've got complaints about losing mails
Hey, girl!
Who do you want?
Excuse me... Is Aga here?
He's off to work. What do you want?
He won't be back until late afternoon
I'm the coordinator of the band
This CD is for his reference
Please give it to him
So, you're that Japanese girl?
Come on. Come in, please
No, thanks. I'll write him a note
Won't you come in and have a seat?
No, thanks
You're Japanese...
...but you write well in Chinese
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
I didn't mean to hurt you
My betel nut...
What is it?
I'm fine
Are you all right?
I can't see
Wipe them clean! I can't see...
Help him up
My legs are fine
Get on!
Wipe them clean!
Excuse me... well...
Thank you
What happened? Are his hands hurt?
Damn!
What happened to your nose?
He's hurt already
and you put an X on his nose?
His wound is right here
I have to avoid his eyes and nose tip
What else can I do?
What are you laughing at? He's in pain
The staircase is too steep
You really know how to play this?
Can you do it?
It's not what you're thinking!
Aga!
Aga...
Please! Don't tell anyone!
He's young and ignorant
Why don't you help him?
Don't I have anything better to do?
I'm old and limping
and you want me to help him?
How many times have I told you?
What if it's notifying someone's...
...wedding, giving birth or death?
We have phones. Who writes letters anymore?
Damn you!
Are you working for the post office
or the phone company?
Old Mao, don't tell anyone please
Come on. I don't need money
Buy whatever you like with it
I like playing music
Buy a new instrument then
Who am I playing for?
Who wants to listen to...
...us old people playing?
The newspaper says I'm a gem
Who gives a damn?
If I'm a gem, I should go out and show them...
...instead of staying at home
All right...
Only hundreds of them
They won't give you so hard a time
I heard someone got in jail
for opening private letters
I told you it's not that!
What is it then?
Porno?
Yeah, yeah...
How I wish a storm would come now...
...and drown me in the ocean
between Taiwan and Japan
Then I won't have to be
responsible for my cowardice
Tomoko...
I've been sailing for several days
The weeps brought by the sea wind
age me already
I don't want to leave the deck
or go to bed
I've made up my mind
Once I land...
...I'll no longer see the ocean
Sea wind, why do you always bring the weeps?
They weep for being in love,
for marrying someone
or giving birth
I weep when I think of you
marrying someone else
But the sea wind dries my tears...
...before they drop
I can't cry any tear, which ages me even more
Curse the wind!
Curse the moonlight!
Curse the sea!
I told you already!
The bass guitarist was too old
Now you have someone even older
It was not me who asked him here
I'm not in charge here
You're not in charge?
All right, I'll see
how you're going to sing on stage
I love my girl
I love you so much
When we were in the park...
...do you know what happened?
I saw the moonlight...
You...
You really want him
to use that as a bass guitar?
I bet that old man...
...never touched a bass guitar
Our Japanese singer will be here soon
What can we do now?
What about your other song?
I haven't seen anything!
Have you listened to the CD I gave you?
Look at him!
Don't tell me writing songs
is not your job
What are you doing?
Look!
It's salt!
He spent his time at the beach
You've been late everyday
I thought you were busy writing songs
Now I know that you were at the beach
How can you be so mean?
I quit!
Get out of my way!
Why didn't you say anything?
Do you understand anything she said?
Wow! The Japanese eats everything!
I see the moonlight sprinkling
I have something to tell you
Please think about it, girl...
What are you doing?
Play this
How do you play this thing?
Hey! Are you leaving?
Hey! Japanese girl!
Your job is not done. Why are you leaving?
Miss Tomoko, what's wrong with you?
Miss Tomoko!
Miss Tomoko...
The grandson of my younger brother
is getting married today
We have the reception this evening
Please come and enjoy with us
We'll be waiting for you
Congratulations
I'm the bass guitarist of the band
I want to practice a little
Look, Mr. Representative!
This Hakka is so diligent
He works day in and day out
Diligence is the only strategy he knows
The bottles of wine he's sold today...
...are more than the mails at Aga's
Shit!
Nothing...
Hey! Malasun!
Chateau Hotel. May I help you?
60 bottles?
OK... Thank you. Bye
Let me show you one more time
Why can't I do it right?
What can I do?
Malasun!
What the hell?
Let me show you. It's...
Malasun! You hit the jackpot!
Mr. Representative called...
...and asked for 60 bottles of wine
For the wedding reception
60...
I'm sorry...
60! 60 bottles...
Malasun, you know Mr. Representative well?
Please give this old man a chance
Don't tell him you can play, please
Malasun! Hi, everyone!
It's on Mr. Representative
Our company's new product Malasun millet wine
Aga!
Come on... Bon appetit!
Miss Tomoko...
This is Aga's mother
I've seen her. She visited us once
Sit there!
Harder!
Next! Mr. Chen Kuang-hui
Here I am! I'm Chen Kuang-hui
Dad, my head aches! Stop!
All right!
I don't need help!
Idiot!
Wow! You really can drink!
Why are you dressed like this?
I don't know. Well...
Sit there...
There's no seat here
I'll... sit there instead
Hi, Ma'am
Why are you dressed like this?
Uncle Frog, you're handsome!
Thank you, Mr. Lin
You're so cute!
Stop, you chicken! I'll get you!
Go on... Cheer for Daddy
Go on, cheer for Daddy
Now..."Whirling Neon Light"
You have suits like this one?
The boss is drunk again
This is for you
The December sea is filled with anger
I tolerate the shame and regrets...
...accompanied by uneasiness
Not sure I'm going home...
...or leaving home
Hey, friend...
This is my princess
Isn't she pretty?
If you see her, please tell her...
...that I no longer take risks
I'm back here for a peaceful life
Please?
Mr. Representative...
It's the last bottle. Cheers!
No, I have more
I'll do it
I'll leave it here
Enjoy yourself. Thank you
This Hakka is really...
It's all right. I'll go. You eat
He always gets drunk and falls
Come on. Drink...
Mr. Representative!
How are you? Long time no see
Fine. I'm great
This is my wife
Is she pretty?
Yeah...
Here. Propose a toast over there
They're waiting for you. Go ahead...
I'm sorry...
He was at the SWAT team in Taipei
You know them, always taking risks
Sometimes they were gone all day long
His wife left him because of it
He's always in a bad mood
Once he fell from the 3rd floor
while he was chasing the perpetrator
I want to sing
He was hurt badly
Stayed at the hospital for six months
Then he was reassign here, back home
Tomoko?
- Tomoko? - Get off me!
- Tomoko! - I said get off me!
First love is filled with emotions
I flush when she says she loves me
The girl is happy
But she pretends to be angry
Oh... yeah... she's pretending
First love is filled with emotions
I flush when she says she loves me
Fuck! I'm looking at the characters!
Your owner's wife is older than you
And she has 3 kids too
What matters is her husband is still alive
What the hell are you thinking?
Have you seen breeding frogs?
A couple of male frogs
get on one female's back
Those male frogs...
Do they fight one another?
No!
Then why should we human beings...
...insist on monogamy?
Right on!
Aga! Come out!
Come out!
Why don't you come out?
You're too proud!
Why did you treat me like that?
Aga!
You're so cocky!
Why did you do this to me?
I'm simply doing my job
What are you laughing at?
Damn you!
I got you!
Look at this
This is my princess
She's pretty, isn't she?
Isn't she pretty?
If you see her, please tell her...
Why did you do this to me?
Why did you do this to me?
I'm a girl...
...away from home
I'm working here
And I work very hard
Why did you do this to me?
Why did you do this to me?
Evening. We're on the Sea of Japan
My head ached badly earlier today
I hate this thick fog
It blocked my sight during the day
But the stars are beautiful
Remember when you were in 7th grade...
you challenged my lunar eclipse theory
...with the myth of Moon being eaten?
I'll tell you another scientific truth
Do you know the stars we see now...
...are lights reflected...
...from billions of light-years away?
Wow! Billions of light-years away!
And we haven't seen them until now
In billions of light-years...
...what will Taiwan and Japan become of?
Mountains and seas will still be there
But the people will be gone
I want to take another glimpse at the sky
In this changeable world...
...I want to see what eternity is
I met a school of grey mullet
heading to Taiwan for the winter
I trust my love to you to one of them
May your fisherman father catch it
Tomoko, though it tastes bad...
...you have to try it anyway
You'll understand...
...that I didn't mean to leave you
I'm moaning on the deck at night...
...that I didn't mean to leave you
You really expect anything from us?
But after 15 years...
...I fail after all
Though I'm not really that bad
A new day dawns, but who cares?
Sunlight only brings thick mist anyway
I saw before dawn...
...the aged you from the future...
...and the aged me from the future
The morning mist covers
my wrinkles on the forehead
The sun scorches your black hair
I've lost you completely
Tomoko...
Please forgive the cowardly me
You...
Those letters are very important
You have to give them to that girl...
...whatever it takes
Oh, Jeez!
Who did this?
You idiot! You'll be put into jail!
I told you to return the mail
but you opened it instead?
Cape No.7, Hengchun
Kojima Tomoko?
I don't remember this person
We're about the same age if she's still alive
It's 16 degrees Celsius here...
...with a 12-knot wind
above the 97-meter-deep sea
I've seen a couple of sea birds
We're landing tomorrow night
Tomoko...
I left you all my photos taken in Taiwan
I gave them to your mother
But I took one of them with me
It's you playing at the beach
The sea in the photo is so calm...
...and your smiles fascinate me
Whoever your new lover will be...
...he can't be good enough for you
I thought I packed all my beautiful memories
Now I realize that all I can take away
is emptiness
I really miss you!
Wow! Rainbow!
May the rainbow bridge the two ends of ocean
...and bridge you and me
When sunshine returns
To the rainy southern country
I'll try to finish
The love story in the past
When sunshine...
So many strings. I can't do it right
It's a love song!
It's easy. Only a few chords
Come on!
Let me tell you something
Come earlier to practice tomorrow
All right...
I never use these two strings
Can I cut them off?
No, you can't!
Say it nicely. Why did you shout?
Have you found that girl?
I tried, but didn't find her
I'll try harder
The lyrics...
I know. I'll revise them
So... I have to go
I need to turn off the lights
I'll do it
All right, it's up to you guys
Yeah, I think he can do it well
I think so too
Damn!
You were so quick to answer
I'm senile!
You hurt my feelings
It's you who brought him here, not us
Yeah! We don't even know him
Never mind me, Old Mao
Come on! I know what you want
You're cocky only because
you can play the bass guitar?
Why can't we have two bass guitarists?
Any instrument is all right for me
I have to be on stage
Damn! They say I'm a gem!
Tomoko, I've landed safely
After the seven-day voyage...
...I finally step on my homeland
But I miss the sea already
Why is the sea standing for...
...the two extremes of hope and death?
This is my last letter to you
I'll mail them later
This sea can't tolerate love
At least it can tolerate lovesickness
Tomoko, you must receive my lovesickness
So that you'll forgive me a little bit
I'll bury you in my heart forever
Even when I'm getting married...
...or at some turning points of life...
...I'm bound to think of you
The girl who ran away from home...
...standing alone in the crowd...
...wearing the white hat...
...which you'd worked so hard to buy
You wanted me to recognize you
in the crowd, didn't you?
I saw you... I saw you...
You were standing there silently
It's an old address. Anyone knows?
You're like the July sun
I dare not glimpse at you any longer
I saw you standing there silently
You lit up my chilled heart
I was sad, but had to hide my feelings
I didn't speak anything
I know that my lovesickness...
...is like the shadow under the sun...
...chased by me and chasing me...
...for the eternity
Why are you so sad?
Because of love? Of work?
Or is it because of us?
I'm afraid it'll still be raining tomorrow
Miss Tomoko...
Aren't you expecting the rainbow?
Tomoko...
I wrote my guiltiness in my last letter...
...to show my apology to you
That's how I can forgive myself
Hey, you two!
No singing for you tomorrow on stage
Can you live with that?
I was sleepless last night, thinking
I've played yukin for more than 50 years
I'll be on stage for the first time
tomorrow and I'll be shaking this?
Hey, you!
You can sing very well
Don't you want to sing on stage?
I think...
Shut up! No one asks you anything
Hey, slam-dunker...
Red hair is not trendy now
Aga is home revising the lyrics
He asked us to rehearse without him
Today, I bought something
for each of you at the airport
Dada, this is Ancestors' Eyes...
...to protect your health
Thank you
Malasun!
This is Bead of Butterfly Pupa...
...to bring you fortune...
...for your diligence
Thanks. Fortune is all I need
Frog!
This is Bead of Hands and Legs...
...to improve your craftsmanship
Rauma...
This is Bead of Peacock...
...to guard your love for your wife
This is Bead of Tears
It's my lifelong aching for my wife
But I bought it. Wear it anyway
You're aching because of love
Thank you...
Thank you...
Old Mao!
Duck's grandpa is playing the timbrel now
Playing the timbrel is good as well
Old Mao! This is Bead of Sunshine
It represents your nobility
I have Mazu too. Won't they fight?
No, they won't!
We're all family. Why should we fight?
Speaking of family...
Actually I have something for you
We need unification...
...because we're all part of the band
I had these custom-made earlier
And I'll give them to you right now
This is my own design
It's our uniform actually...
...for us to wear on stage
Uniform?
Malasun
Thousands years of history with new sensation
The uniform for family
Sorry to bother you
Make yourselves at home. I'll be in my room
The breeze informs of Spring's coming
The fragrance of blooming flowers...
...reminds me of you far away
You're like a blooming flower
in the sunshine of Spring
The light of hope will lead us
well into the future
We're stepping on the roads we chose
Now I know...
...why people said I sang too hard
Aga, I...
Are you all here? It's your turn
All right?
Atari, all right?
- OK! - Yeah, I see
Please
Do me a favor
I'll make a DVD
Project our logo on that big screen
It's the best way of promotion
Don't ask too much!
You've got the T-shirts
Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot!
Let's have a rest in the hotel
Tomoko, can you ask them
to prepare the meal?
That policeman is the band's guitarist
Policeman?
You're very popular in Taiwan
Miss Tomoko...
Rainbow!
Can I have a cigarette?
Don't tell me you don't speak Japanese
After today...
...you don't have to see us anymore
I'm in love with Aga
I've been in love before
But this is different
I don't know if it's love or not
You Japanese don't know what love is
Have you been hurt by any Japanese?
Why are you so prejudiced?
Is it Dada's father?
He must've hurt you really bad
My heart died long ago
I'm looking for a girl in Hengchun
whose heart died too
She's probably 80 years old now
Her name is also Tomoko
I saw a package at Aga's place
A Japanese package with an unknown address
Or more aptly put...
...there are seven love letters in it
When the Japanese old man died...
...his daughter found them in his closet
She mailed them on his behalf
Unfortunately, no one remembers
an old address 60 years ago
I read those love letters
Never seen anything more beautiful
It'd comfort the lovesick old lady
What's the matter with you?
Send the package to this address
That Tomoko lives here
How do you know that?
She's my grandmother
Then... I'll give the package to you
I did something bad to her
She doesn't want to see me anymore
Go ahead!
Go!
Aga!
Aga!
I found the owner of the package
Can you go now?
That urgent?
Aga...
When the concert is over...
...I'll go back to Japan...
...with the Japanese staff
They offered me a job in Japan
And you accepted?
Don't forget to tell me...
...what that Tomoko looks like
This is Bead of Warrior...
...to guard your honor and bravery
I'll pretend that you forget me...
...that you send your love to me away...
...like a migrating bird
...and that you throw the past away
I'll pretend...
...until I believe everything I imagine
And then...
...I'll wish you all the happiness
Anybody home?
Anybody home?
Hey! What did you say to Aga?
Those near the sea water...
Please come closer!
The tide is ebbing
Please come closer!
Please come closer!
Thank you!
Be careful! Come closer!
What were you thinking?
You asked him to send a mail?
What's wrong with you?
Mr. Manager...
...wanna contact Mr. Representative?
He may be in the crowd
What good will it do?
Do something! Do you hear me?
Miss Tomoko...
Is there anyone who can sing?
I can sing very well!
Ask him if you don't believe me
Ask him
Aga's here!
Come on! Get on stage...
What took you so long?
Didn't they hate each other?
Stay...
...or I'll go with you
Don't be nervous! Relax!
Who's nervous? Idiot!
I wanna collect the warmth of Summer
Wanna cross the river named Happiness
Wanna be a snake swallowing elephant
It sounds stupid, but why not?
I wanna write a song
When the sky is empty and the earth is dry
I'm pouring passion for you
Make you crazy and make you thirsty
I want the whole world to know you're mine
The weather's gone mad and the sea is boiling
That's why I want to seize the day
Stop wasting time
Be a skywalker...
An angel like you
Should have wings and name
Should have fatal beauty
Should belong to me for once
When the sky is empty and the earth is dry
I'm pouring passion for you
Make you crazy and make you thirsty
I want the whole world to know you're mine
The weather's gone mad and the sea is boiling
That's why I want to seize the day -Grandpa!
Stop wasting time
Be a skywalker...
When the sky is empty and the earth is dry
I'm pouring passion for you
Make you crazy and make you thirsty
I want the whole world to know
that you're mine
The end of the world scares me not
I'll keep on enjoying myself
'Cause loving you makes me happy
Be a skywalker...
Be happy, oh...
Relax! What are you afraid of?
Here. Take this
If Sea can talk
and if Wind falls in love with Sands
If my longing's lost in vacancy
I'll listen to the waves
Let the wind blow my hair
My love for you grows with time
Summer's here when Spring's away
I finally realize on retrospect
When sunshine returns
To the rainy southern country
I'll try to finish
The love story
In the past
When sunshine leaves
The too sunny southern country
Will you give me back
All the love you took away
Before you said goodbye
Sea is blue. Stars shine bright
My arms are empty without you
Sky is endless at my lonely nights
Please forgive my hesitancy
To confess that I love you
This is Bead of Peacock...
...to guard your everlasting love
When sunshine returns
To the rainy southern country
I'll try to finish
The love story
In the past
The rainbow... Thank you very much
Don't mention it
Will you give me back
All the love you took away
Before you said goodbye
It's all right. Let them sing one more
No, they only have two songs
Come here!
Old Mao!
Rauma!
Rauma...
A boy sees a wild rose
Ah! I know that song too
It blooms so early in the morning
He rushes to see it clearly
The rose makes him happy
Rose, rose, the red rose
The rose in the wilderness
Miss Tomoko...
These are the letters my father wrote
I accidentally found them
in my father's bedroom closet
My father died in January this year
I read every one of the letters
How the beautiful secrets...
...hidden in them broke my heart
I mailed these letters he wrote...
...which he was supposed to send...
...60 years ago
Sorry for keeping you waiting for so long
