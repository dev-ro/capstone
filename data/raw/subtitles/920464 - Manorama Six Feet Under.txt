Lakhot. Maybe the
name sounds familiar...
It figures in the
papers at least twice a year
First in summer...
When, about a 100 people
drop dead in the scorching heat.
Then in winter when another 100
or so are claimed by the cold.
A small, sleepy, desert town,
which has a world of it's own.
Before last Diwali, who
would have thought that...
everything here
was about to change.
Like they say, creation is
preceded by destruction.
It hadn't rained a drop
in three years and this...
town was starting to feel
like my life - dry, withered...
Ineffective and thirsty.
And just like my life, work on
the new canal had also stopped.
Maybe, that's how deserts are born.
This is a dream...
This is a betrayal...
This is a game of life...
The path of lies...
Even life partner is a betrayer...
The caravan of this world is farce...
Millions of people
are traitors here...
Even today it is sold...
Here's a truth about the desert
many things lie hidden
under the surface here.
Often, what seems like an illusion
turns out to be real and what seems...
real turns out
to be an illusion.
Like there under a grey, cloudy sky;
right in the middle of the road...
Seducing me Yana Gupta.
Love is life...
Friend is a betrayal...
The whole world is betrayal...
Nobody belongs to anybody here...
Nobody belongs to me...
Satya Veer-ji
Yes Bihari-ji...
You wanted something?
New motorcycle?
What do you think?
Loan or instalment?
Single payment.
Single payment! just what I thought.
Congratulations.
Listen... Babloo's
messed his pants again!
- Coming.
- Come and help me.
What was Bihari Lal saying?
Nothing... Just.
Where's Raju?
He's gone for a birthday party.
I closed the parlour
early today... Tea?
No.
Your editor called.
Something about some deadline
Oh. And...
your press card arrived.
Did they publish your story?
Yes, page 22.
Is something wrong?
Come, sit...
What happened?
Did the suspension
order come through?
This afternoon.
For how long?
Pending investigation.
You are so gullible.
The whole department's on the take.
And you are the only
naive idiot who gets caught.
Where's the remote?
Mummy-ji had warned me, I should
have married that boy from Jaipur.
The family had four sari stores.
But I had to get stuck with
a junior engineer in the PWD.
Why does your press card
say; Surendra Mohan Upadhyay?
It's my pen name.
Pen name? Why do
you need a pen name?
And go easy on the water.
Your in-law's aren't
gifting us a water tanker.
There comes an age in
every man's life when...
he can't recognize
himself in the mirror.
As a kid, I thought I'd
be really famous some day.
Not a famous film star or detective.
Just a famous writer.
And 'Manorama'- my 'great' novel,
my grand chance...
my one last hope
my one last hope
The biggest washout in
the history of writing
only 200 copies sold.
And a year later, where am I?
Neither here nor there...
In the middle of this
god-forsaken desert...
Leading a petty,
nameless existence...
With petty problems,
taking petty bribes.
Are we going to
Rohtak for Diwali or not?
Brij can't go either...
all because of
this canal issue.
You know, I think that
astrologer was right about you.
What did he say Papa?
Quiet. Which astrologer?
That fellow your mother took me to...
he said that you've been
pursuing me from a previous life.
Don't try and change the subject...
Are we going to Rohtak or not?
We'll have to wait
till the enquiry is over.
That means no.
You promised we'd
play snakes and ladders
I didn't promise snakes and ladders
Yes. You did.
Really? It must have been Ludo.
Snakes and Ladders.
- Ludo.
- Ok. Ludo.
- OK. Tomorrow.
- No. Not fair.
Who said life's fair. Later... ok?
It's all because of your new bike.
It just drew attention.
You are acting as a very rich man.
But do you ever listen to anyone?
Can we go for a
ride on the motorbike?
Come, Raju... it's time for bed.
My TV show's going to start.
You know what she says?
If Iravati was so bothered,
she wouldn't be sitting in Delhi.
I am seeing. This
house has become hermitage.
Why don't you go write or something?
Don't feel like it.
You never feel like it these days.
So, you are here, Iravati.
And not just your writing...
Is Satya Veer
Randhawa-ji there, please?
Satya Veer-ji?
I need to talk to you...
alone.
It's very important.
Come in.
This way.
Please, sit.
- Sorry!
- No! Please, it's ok.
Excuse me.
Yes, tell me?
Nimmi, keep your voice down.
She'll hear you.
So? I don't care.
Who is she? What does she want?
Nimi, Please. I don't know.
Look, she's a stranger.
She's waiting, I'm going back in.
So go! Were you
looking for permission?
- I'm going!
- Go!
I can't see your book anywhere.
Oh sorry. I don't have a copy.
Not a single copy for yourself?
No...
Please... sit.
Your photo on the book's back cover...
You look just like it.
Manorama is one of
my favourite books.
Your hero Detective Raghu...
He must be based on you?
Uh, no.
Anyway he's just a character
And one can't hire characters,
but creators...
I'm sorry I don't understand you?
Have you heard of P.P. Rathore?
The MLA...? The state
minister for irrigation?
The Ex-Raja of Lakhkot?
Do you know of his wife?
I'm Mrs. P. P. Rathore.
And I need your help.
How could I help you?
It's a matter of some delicacy...
Yes I think my husband
is having an affair.
I need proof and I want
you to get me this proof.
I want you to follow my husband
Catch him red-handed and take photos
But, why me?
It's obvious. This is a small town...
I can't get a private investigator.
The closest I can get is you...
the man who
created Detective Raghu. You.
I will pay you for
your services, of course.
Ten thousand.
Once the job is done,
I'll pay ten thousand more.
Is twenty thousand enough?
Yes.
I've written down all
the relevant details.
When the assembly is in recess,
my husband spends his weekends
alone at our ancestral home.
I suspect that's the
only opportune time for...
him to conduct his affair.
Can I ask you a question?
How come you don't have
a copy of your own book?
Just that
It reminds me of my failure.
Now you want to play detective?
Are you nuts? I want to go to
Rohtak, not the loony bin in Agra.
You know, I had some
great marriage offers too.
Oh great - at least we'll
get to see the Taj Mahal there.
Down with the Irrigation minister!
Down with P.P. Rathore!
Long live the Peoples United Party.
The canal is a death trap.
Down with the canal.
The canal will kill us all.
Down with the Irrigation Minister.
We agree that the
region needs water...
But what will be gained
by fleecing poor farmers?
When we all know that
the water will never come...
Why are they taking our land away?
These feudals just want
To lord over us again.
I've taken some photos of
your husband with the woman
They were having
some sort of argument.
I was too far away
to hear the details.
Well then...
There was one other thing...
Was there something else?
The photo studio was shut...
So I couldn't get the
photos developed. Sorry
That's all right.
Don't mind me! I'm just the maid!
Quarter Kg carrots.
And half kg peas.
The whole world stands one side
and wife's brother goes to Malpur.
It's said that there was a
time when the people of Lakhot...
believed in love, not war.
The world may have changed...
But there's one man who
has kept the tradition alive.
Every morning, a big
bite of a sweet pancake...
finds its way into his mouth...
- And two words of love spill out.
- Ass-hole!
Are you trying to feed me left-overs
from your father's wedding?
What are you saying inspector?
You know my pancakes
are my best-selling item.
There's no question
of them being stale.
The question has already been raised.
Are you calling me a liar,
a cheat, a fraud?
Why don't I just arrest myself?
Come now, Inspector. Try one more.
So this is Sub-inspector Brij Mohan
My brotherin-law and best friend.
Oye, Brother-in-law, on for tonight?
You know the trouble with women?
If they can't snare a good husband,
they'll cry for a lifetime.
But if they are lucky
enough to get a good one,
They'll make him cry for a lifetime.
Know why I haven't
tasted the fruit of marriage?
So that I could savor
the sweet pancakes of life!
No woman, no problems.
Single and happy.
Nimi's not that bad.
Really? You've married a demon.
That makes you a
demon too, doesn't it?
So, have I ever claimed to be a god?
Did I ever say it? Never.
She's just been under a lot of
stress, lately - And so have I.
Go away for a day or two with Nimi...
take her for a - what's it
called? - a second-hand honeymoon.
Second honey moon.
Yeah that's what I mean.
It'll make a world of a difference.
I'll keep Raju.
Did the astrologer really say that?
Astrologer? About our past lives?
He did. Your Mummy-ji
told you, didn't she?
So we've been together
for two lives, at least?
No. He said you'd been
pursuing me in the last one...
You only managed to
get me this time around.
Oh really? Stupid!
Show me that blue one.
You won't find a Sari like this...
- anywhere else in Jaipur.
- I'm just going outside.
Ok... and don't smoke.
- Show me that one...
- Yes.
One pack, please.
Madam... Meenakshi-ji...
See! I bought the blue one.
- Doesn't the colour suit me?
- Yes.
Were you smoking?
Um. Just one.
Naughty boy! You
promised you wouldn't.
That Reshma will be so envious!
See, feel it, it's so soft!
- See!
- Yes...
He has been chosen for
the post of prime minister.
Now we have to wait
to see who will be...
appointed as the
president of India...
In Raiasthan's Lakhot district,
the construction of a new...
water-sports complex
for children commenced today.
The State Minister for Irrigation...
Mr. P.P. Rathore was
present on the occasion.
The foundation stone was laid by...
the Minister's wife Mrs.
Meenakshi Rathore.
Mrs. Rathore is rarely seen in
public due to health reasons.
However, she said that
any development efforts...
for children must be
supported in every way.
We'll give Mummy and
Papa this tea set on Diwali...
They'll be so happy.
I wonder what Brij's
been feeding Raju...
Or teaching him. He
himself barely scraped...
through school by cheating...
Poking your nose in
affairs of the ministers...
and messing up with a
dog is not a very good idea.
If you do, then in the
first case you have to inject...
yourself for 14 times
and the second, you are ruined.
But since the entire
incident is in the past tense and...
the lady in question has
paid you for your services.
I suggest you forget the matter.
It doesn't matter who she was.
There was something else...
What?
I think someone saw me that night.
Papa!
Raiu! Come here... How are you?
Brij. Not in front of the kid.
On the contrary, I am
of the opinion that...
children should be
exposed to the realities...
of life as early as possible.
Right, Raiu?
Yes Uncle!
But who was she?
What do they say in English?
Curiosity kills the cat.
Is there another bottle
or did you drink it all?
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.
Do you remember that condom ad?
Yes.
A little bit of
caution goes a long way!
A little bit of
caution goes a long way!
Satya Veer! Satya Veer, please stop!
My life is in danger. Please if...
Lust a minute.
Just making sure you're real.
Been imagining all
sorts of things lately...
Please. If something happens to me...
You know, there's this girl I see
No it's a woman
No, a girl. I see her.
I need you to remember my name
My real name is Manorama...
lust like your book...
Hold on. Sorry for interruption
But did you really like my book?
Did you even read it?
Manorama. And I am 32...
Please. Remember
Please remember if
anything happens to me. Please.
32? It that your age
or your waist size?
Nimi, I'm going out. Need anything?
Manorama.
The name I was trying to
forget had come back to haunt me.
This time not a heroine in a
novel but a living, breathing woman.
And she betrayed me once again.
Raiu, want some jam on your toast?
Mummy-ji had called...
Are you listening?
Death of a social worker...
Manorama Shukla, who
was part of an organisation...
campaigning against
the Rajasthan Vikas Canal...
was killed in an
accident on the highway.
Preliminary investigations
haven't indicated any foul play
though the police
suspect it could be suicide.
It's her. She committed suicide.
Nimi
If you were committing suicide...
would you kill yourself by
jumping in front of a truck?
I should tell you I don't have
much inheritance coming my way.
It's all going to Brij,
unfortunately...
What's wrong with you?
The paper said suicide.
You believe everything
that the papers print?
You lied about a college education,
didn't you?
Social worker killed... if
anything happens to me...
Please remember my name...
Campaigning against the canal...
My name is Manorama
and I'm 32 years old.
Who would be against
bringing water to this desert?
But we believe that the
Irrigation Minister Rathore is...
using this promised
canal only to win votes.
The 1981 water
agreement between Punjab...
Haryana and
Rajasthan is in dispute...
And the other states are
refusing to release water...
I'm sure I'll find all
that in here. - Yes.
So, Manorama Shukla, was she
also part of this protest?
Yes...?
Manorama Shukla was
working in your organisation?
I'm sorry but I'm confused.
What's your article about?
It's about your
organisation but we need to...
have a human
interest angle as well.
Like the suicide. It
attracts the general audience and...
this way we can get the readership
for our socio-political views.
Yes.
So, did she have any family here?
She was from Jaipur.
She lived here with a room-mate...
The room-mate's name? Maybe
you have it written somewhere...
Thank you.
Ah. Here it is. Sheetal.
Sheetal... and their address?
- Remember the readers...
- Yes. Sure.
House 105, 1st Floor, Talati Haveli...
Sheetal-ji?
And you are...?
Satya Veer. Sorry. I
needed to talk to you...
You're not some kind
of salesman, are you?
Because I have a bus to catch.
No. No. It's about Manorama
She was a client of mine.
I'm sorry but whatever you're
saying doesn't make any sense.
Look, I can't tell you more here.
Manorama came to meet me
the night she was killed.
She was in a state of panic.
What do you mean?
Manorama's suicide
is not what it seems.
I'm sorry but I'm
really getting very late.
My bus.
Was there anything
unusual in the last few days?
Did she say anything?
Please try to recollect.
This is my home phone number.
If you remember anything...
Anything at all, call me.
It's very important.
Satya Veer Randhawa... the writer?
Yes.
Your stop, get down.
Come on, get in. let's go.
Yes. That's right. I'm her father,
- Gyan Chand Shukla. 1990
- Year of graduation. Correct.
Are you sure? There's no
Manorama Shukla in your records?
Could you check 1989 or 1991?
I'm sorry, there seems
to be some confusion.
I'll call you back. Thank you.
Mrs. P.P. Rathore.
Meenakshi Rathore.
Manorama Shukla.
And now - apparently there's
no Manorama Shukla either.
Who the hell was she, Nimi?
Take this. Come let's go.
Catch hold of him. The Bastard...
Get him!
You scoundrel!
Hey, wait! Stop there.
Hey wait or I'll shoot you.
Stop there. I am
telling you to stop!
I'll shoot all the
six bullets in you.
- Yes, tell me.
- Soldier.
You know peanuts are bad
for your asthma, right?
Yeah! I know.
What did that woman
tell you that night?
Speak the truth.
Were you banging her?
What woman?
Remember now?
Not so easily.
Can't hide your stomach
from the midwife, jerk.
Won't talk? Won't talk?
Was she telling you a joke?
We want to hear it too!
- Yeah, we want to hear it too.
- Tell us!
- Nothing, she didn't say anything.
- Speak up.
She said nothing?! Asshole!
What did she say? Talk!
Your turn. You question him.
I don't know anything.
Can I shoot him?
Are you nuts?
- Listen.
- Just this one time... Just once.
- Three here... At least three
- Please!
Idiot, If you kill him, how
will we find out anything?
Here - break his fingers.
Snap them in two.
- I don't want to. You do it.
- What?
I won't break them.
Do your own dirty work.
You're just scared.
Wanna talk?
She just...
All she said was that
her name was Manorama.
And that her age was 32.
That's all. I swear.
32?
32?
Why would the bitch tell you her age?
You weren't filling in a damn
application form for her. Were you?
How should I know! I
told you what she said!!
Give me your right hand. C'mon!
I don't know anything else.
I think he's telling the truth.
You shut up! Stupid Chicken!
What do you have?
What do you have there?
Hey. Catch
Bike keys.
You mind your own business...
from now on. OK?
And with full honesty.
Let's go water the canal.
What did you call me? Chicken?
Yes chicken, come let's go.
Had a wild night, huh?
You know why tourists go to Jaipur?
Because it's the pink city.
That's what we need A pink city.
Nimi kept calling all night long.
You owe me one brother-in-law.
Doctor can't we hurry this up?
The entire state
machinery is waiting for you.
Done doctor? Thank you Doctor.
And You know what's
the icing on the cake?
What?
Because of you, I'm not
getting any pancakes today.
Those two. Why don't you
find who they work for...
What's the point?
The maximum charge would
be assault and battery.
They'd be walking free in 15 minutes.
Brij. We're not talking
about an extra pancake here.
A woman's been murdered!
Really? And what proof do you have?
Any evidence? Anything?
As of now, the only provable
crime is one of criminal trespass
Slowly sneaking into the minister's
house illegally and spying.
Now, should I register a case?
We cremated her body yesterday.
No family members came forward.
Look, I'm still
telling you she was murdered.
Brother-in-law...
And I'm still telling
you this is stupidity.
Go write a novel or something
and stop playing detective.
And for your kind information,
we released the truck-driver
involved in the accident.
It was a simple accident case.
She ran out in the
middle of the road.
It was dark. He didn't see
her and she got run over.
Sir, the commissioner is on air.
What does he want now?
I'll be right back.
Jayesh. Jayesh Pathak.
LIC and General insurance agent.
In today's world, one needs
adequate insurance coverage.
One never knows with life.
Anything can happen.
That's why I say
A little bit of
caution goes a long way!
What are you doing?
What do you want?
You could have asked me.
What do you want?
The Truck driver's name? His number?
I'll give it to you.
But one last time
Then forget all this nonsense.
Look, I'll file a report for
the stolen motorcycle, OK?
You won't even have to
come to the police station.
No, thank you. It's ok.
Come on now, don't sulk.
It's not that.
What is it then?
The thing is...
I - Uh - It was a 'gift'
from Sima Construction.
It's still registered in their name.
And with this department inquiry on...
Listen!
This isn't for little
fish like us. Understand?
These politicians are big fish.
And what do big fish like to eat?
Little fish.
That's right. Tell
Nimi she owes me big time.
You know what Mummy-ji told me
when we were getting married?
What?
If you keep your man happy
in bed, he'll never stray.
You think that's true?
Is that ceiling fan
more interesting than me?
SV, what have you got involved in?
OK. Whatever it is, it has to stop.
They could have killed you.
Or me. Or Raiu.
I'm going to Rohtak with Raiu...
With you or without you.
It's not like you're
ever here for us anyway.
So go then...
without me.
You're going to ride
this bucket of bolts?
I thought you said you
were going to Rohtak.
What do you care?
I called the insurance company
office a million times Mr. Pathak.
We work 26 hours a day.
We run a very tight ship here.
You, come here!
Hey you, you think
you're paid for smoking?
You know smoking is not
allowed near those drums!
What's your salary?
800.
800... Here!
You're fired. No
room here for your type
Go. Go on get lost.
That boy, how long has
he been working here?
That boy? He doesn't work here.
He just brought
lunch for Fateh Singh.
Shyam Lowry!
This is Mr. Pathak
From the insurance company.
Tell him about the accident. Ok.
We were coming back from a delivery
On the old Jaipur highway.
Suddenly this woman - she just
came running out of the dark
straight in front of my truck.
I jammed the brakes
But it was too late.
Every thing happened so quickly
. My cleaner, Bhura
and I got out to check.
We checked her pulse.
She was still alive
We put her in the truck
and took her to the hospital
But She died on the way.
Was there anyone else there?
No.
Where exactly on the highway was
this? - Just before Sobara village.
Near the canal site?
This means we are not safe too.
This is astonishing.
- Satya Veer-ji!
- What's wrong?
Some men were trying to
break into your house.
Luckily I noticed
and raised an alarm.
Nimi and Raiu?
Nimi had gone to
the market with Raju.
Aren't they back yet?
Actually...
Nimi said she was leaving for Rohtak.
You weren't at home so
she left a note for you.
Men realize the truth
about marriage too late
That its not a single word,
it's an entire thesis.
Mr. Editor
Yes sir, the story's almost ready.
Just a few days more.
No... Not later than that.
Seriously, without fail, yes.
Hello!
Hello? Satya Veer-ji?
This is Manorama's room-mate Sheetal.
I'm sorry to be calling so
late but I'm really scared...
Someone just tried to kill me.
What happened?
I came home early... and there
must have been someone inside...
I opened the door and
someone hit me on the head.
When I came to...
Did you know Manorama well?
Just as a room-mate...
It'd been only a year
since she'd come from Jaipur.
I've never met a writer before...
Where do you get story
ideas from? Your cases?
I'm no detective... this is just...
That's pretty nasty
but it'll be fine.
Still, maybe you
should see a doctor...
No. I'll be fine.
Shakuntala! Where's Shakuntala?
Shakuntala?
Shakuntala.
Did they take anything else?
No but all my papers from work, my
college degree, etc., are ruined.
Is this your first case?
Somebody may have seen something.
Manorama and I lived alone.
The rest of the rooms are empty.
Where do you work?
At the Rathore Orphanage.
I teach the kids.
Rathore? Any
connection to the minister?
It's part of the royal trust.
Mr. Rathore is our head
trustee and chief donor.
That day - you said
something about Manorama...
That it wasn't suicide.
I don't think they
came here to kill you.
They were probably searching for...
something You just walked in on them.
Your mind is just like
detective Raghu's - razor sharp.
What if something had
happened to Shakuntala?
What if they come back?
Do you have family or friends here?
I I grew up in the orphanage.
Maybe I could stay with you?
No. I'm sorry. I'm sure
you have family at home
It wouldn't be right to trouble them.
I'll take that.
Looks just like a writer's home.
New friends.
My son Raju's...
He's in Rohtak... with my wife,
visiting his grandparents.
How old is he?
Four.
My wife Nimi.
And Brij Mohan Her brother.
Your moustache was quite splendid.
She's very pretty, your wife.
I'm sorry I've put
you in a tight spot.
What will your
neighbours say? And your wife...
A woman A stranger in the house...
Snakes and ladders! I love
snakes and ladders!! You?
Sure. I play with Raiu all the time.
So, I think Manorama
was trying to blackmail...
the minister with
those photos you took
And those people must have
come to search for those photos.
But what was in the photos?
Was it something illegal?
- I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.
- Professional ethics.
Hey Fauji! Fauji!
At night, people
play bedroom games and
this idiot here is playing Ludo.
And we are watching
a dull reality show.
Shhhh Chhaila.
First learn the damn difference
between Ludo and Snakes n Ladders.
Oh I'm sorry. Did
the TV wake you up?
I just love Cartoons.
What are you doing? Please,
you don't have to do this.
It's no big deal, I
do it at home anyway.
Did you sleep ok?
I was a little scared.
You're safe here...
I know.
Breakfast is ready.
You didn't even call
before leaving, Nimi.
I'm sorry for leaving so suddenly.
When are you coming back?
Why don't you come here for Diwali?
I can't come.
I spoke to Mr. Sharma in
the department. He said
there was no reason you could
not leave while on suspension.
I'm sorry I lied about that.
At that time...
I couldn't bear the
thought of Daddy-ji and Mummy-ji and
all the things they would say
About my suspension.
Ok forget that... just take
a train and come here today.
And remember that tea set we
got for Mummy-ji from Jaipur?
Get that along too,
I forgot it there.
Nimi, I said I can't come.
You can't come, or
don't want to come?
So you can prove she was murdered?
No Nimi. So that I can prove myself.
It's the first time I've
taken a decision in my life.
My career
Uncle decided that. Marriage?
Uncle decided. The Kid
You decided.
The kid? My decision? Really?
Raiu was born 9 months after the
wedding. That was my decision?
Have you ever asked
me how I feel about...
Running that stupid beauty parlour?
And running about after Raiu?
Have you ever thought that maybe
I had dreams and ambitions too?
Why will you think about me?
Or are women not allowed that?
My decision, my foot.
You should have used a
condom that first night!
Sorry, I broke your tea set.
Was it very expensive?
No... it's ok.
Today is our Annual Diwali
function at the orphanage.
I don't have to get
to work till later.
What time will you leave for work?
I don't have to go.
I'm on leave for Diwali.
Then why didn't you go
to Rohtak with your wife?
I had some writing to do
and this Manorama case...
The breakfast was very good,
I ate too much.
Please, let it be.
Shall we play Ludo now?
Uh - I need to get
the scooter repaired.
Satyaveer-ji!
Where's your new bike?
It's at the mechanic's.
Nimi's left rather
suddenly... without informing you
ls everything allright at home?
Yes. Daddy-ji wasn't feeling well.
But he's better now.
This is...
Sheetal. Satya Bhaiya's cousin.
From Jaipur. Hello.
Hello.
Listen! Last night there were
some men outside your house...
Thank you.
Are you sure you'll be safe?
Here? Yes, of course.
Please don't worry. Bye.
Bye.
My esteemed friends in
the opposition forget that
We live in a democracy...
And in a democracy, real power
lies not with the ruling party
or the opposition
But with the people.
Our government is here
because of the people.
I remember an old song.
If you listen to the
poor God will listen to you.
If you give a little, He
will give you in abundance.
Due to my wife's
unfortunate accident...
She could not bear a child.
We have... no child of our own.
Considering this as God's will.
We tried to immerse ourselves in
community work for our people.
And God, in his infinite wisdom,
has blessed us...
With the love of
these innocent children.
This gave us the strength to start...
work on the
Rajasthan Vikas Canal
So that not just these children...
But every single child
of this state may have
a brighter future ahead of them.
Thank you Honourable Minister for
sparing your valuable time for us
And for your inspiring words.
We are very fortunate and
honoured to have you as our patron.
As you know, Minister sahib has
a place for these little children
not only in his heart
but also at his home.
Now, if I could request you
all to pray for little Deepti,
who has been missing for some days.
The prayers are
coming out as my desires...
The prayers are
coming out as my desires...
Let we burn like the candle
which gives light to others...
Let we burn like the candle
which gives light to others...
The prayers are
coming out as my desires...
The prayers are
coming out as my desires...
You were supposed to
do something, right?
What about the journalist?
Wasn't he coming this morning?
I called him. The bastard
was sleeping out a hangover.
He said he'd come in the afternoon.
You all stay out.
What was she doing here? I
told you to keep away from her.
What do you want?
I need to get my dressing changed.
Come tomorrow.
Okay.
Dr. Poddar?
He's at the Orphanage clinic.
I know, Madam. Actually,
he asked me to speak to you.
Are you the journalist?
Yes.
Early, aren't you?
I need the media's help.
I want to be recognized By my father.
Your father?
My name is Sameera Rathore.
P.P. Rathore is my father.
But I thought he
didn't have any children.
Well... I didn't know
until a few months ago either.
Quite convenient to
run an orphanage...
where you can
hide your 'accidents'.
Please wait in the Doctor's office.
I'll get the tea...
And your mother? Where is she?
She died when I was three.
My mother was his mistress.
Please excuse the crude word.
You have good taste in books.
- Books? They are all Anil...
- Dr. Poddar's.
Give it to me.
I noticed he had hurt himself...
An accident?
Nothing major. Please sit.
He cut his hand at work.
And his leg?
Polio since childhood.
I'm sorry. Perhaps
I'm probing too much.
No. Please. It's your job.
Journalists Always probing about
Sugar?
One spoon.
So how did you find out?
I fell in love.
- In Love?
- With Anil.
My father brought Anil from
Jaipur about five years ago.
He is my father's personal physician.
And he also manages the
clinic at the orphanage.
He told me the truth about myself.
And how did he know?
He stumbled upon the
records in the orphanage.
Anil's family - they -
they are conservative people.
They are opposed to the
match because I am an orphan.
That's why I
approached my father but...
he's worried about a scandal...
Not just that. My
mother was Muslim and...
My father, well, as you know,
is one of the star politicians
of a right wing Hindu party...
What did he say?
What would he say?
He's refused to accept me.
He rejected me
Didn't even let me call him Papa.
The very next day the
orphanage records were destroyed.
Now let the public decide...
If I deserve the right to
my father's name or not.
Will you do that
for me, Mr. Uphadyay?
- Sameera
- Yes, she grew up in the orphanage.
I know her - but - I wasn't aware
of her connection with Rathore.
Sameera herself only
recently found out.
But Manorama had nothing
to do with the orphanage.
I'm sure she didn't know Sameera...
or her connection to Rathore.
And in any case why
would Rathore kill Manorama
for some photos of
him arguing with...
His alleged illegitimate daughter.
It doesn't make sense.
Are you sure there was
nothing else in the photographs?
Yes.
Do you realize what my
eyes are trying to tell you?
My eyes are talking, I
know you are aware of it...
My life is incomplete without you...
I can't live without you...
The desires are melting...
they are guest for
couple of minutes...
Let the fire of love...
burn in the eyes...
Shakuntala will miss her new friends
so much when she returns home...
My Diwali vacations start today.
So the next time you go out...
Investigating or whatever.
Can I come along?
You'll get bored.
Really? I think it
would be exciting.
I get it. You're worried -...
what if someone sees us together.
Isn't it?
The sickeningly small
mentality of small towns
Here, a woman's life
Or death is less important
Than who she may or
may not be sleeping with.
Sir, tell me.
The canal work is going
to start again real soon...
I can guarantee that.
They've released two new
land blocks for auction today.
The prices will
double in just two weeks!
The canal will make
this desert the new Dubai.
Sir, you don't have to worry.
Just say the word and
I'll hold a plot for you.
Sir, where are you going? My money!
Where are we going?
I got a tip.
A tip? Are you a waiter?
Sorry, bad joke.
Gentlemen, Plot number
302I4 is now Open for bidding.
The reserve price for this
plot is Rs. 2 Hundred Thousand.
So come now, bid for the plot.
Who will bid 2 Hundred Thousand?
I came to this auction today...
Two hundred thousand One.
Two hundred and ten thousand. Two.
Three Lakhs!
Three Lakhs.
Three Lakhs... one.
Three Lakhs... two...
Three hundred and
twenty five thousand.
Three hundred and
twenty-five Thousand! one!
Three hundred and
twenty-five Thousand, two!
Three hundred and
twenty-five Thousand, three! Sold!
Where are you headed, grandpa?
What can I say? We
are just moving along...
We'll go where our hunger
takes us. Our land is gone.
What happened to your land?
I'm just a peasant, son. All
this land belongs to Rathore.
Our families worked this
land for many generations...
eked out a living
from this dry dirt...
But now this canal's coming - the
Raja's barren land will yield gold...
There's no room for us
or our hunger here now.
May God have mercy on us!
Shut up old man!
Don't talk too much.
I told you it would be boring.
Who said I got bored?
I was just passing by...
Thought I'd drop in and
see how you were doing.
This is Sheetal. My
cousin from Jaipur.
She's here for a few days.
From Jaipur?
Why, Forgotten me, already?
But I remember you from
the wedding very well.
In that handsome
pink turban of yours,
you looked like you were the groom.
I don't remember...
It's been many years.
And anyway, marriages are
hardly things to remember...
Isn't that so?
I was just going to leave...
To get my hair cut.
Okay then. I'll come along and
get some trimming done myself.
Brother-in-law, lose you hair.
Just don't lose your pants...
Hail Lord Ram and Goddess Sita.
Hail Lord Ram and Goddess Sita.
Hail Lord Ram and Goddess Sita.
Hey wait!
Wait!
Scoundrel escaped!
Those goons were Rathore's men.
I saw them coming out
of the party office.
Manorama knew that he
was in the canal scam.
He would've tried to blackmail the
minister with those photographs.
So that the canal is not constructed.
It is clear that water will
not pass through the canal.
Or the canal wouldn't
be constructed at all.
Only the people will hope about it.
If there is hope, then the land
around the canal will hike in price.
Most of the land is
in minister's name.
He will sell all that
and move away from here.
Manorama knew everything about this,
so she became a danger to them.
Rathore moved her from his way.
Yes, but the truck driver said that...
nobody was present there.
I think you are right.
You need to think
this over with a clear mind.
- Hello Nimi.
- Who? Oh. Brij.
Remember my aunt in Jaipur.
Her daughter.
Wake up! There's call.
It's the doctor.
Doctor? What doctor?
Dr. Poddar, the one
from the orphanage!
Why would he call me?
How did he get my number?
Hello?
Dr. Poddar?
Sameera-ji?
Dr. Poddar?
Is anyone there?
Sameera-ji.
Dr. Poddar.
I hear there's been a
fire cracker of a murder?
Double murder! A
doctor and his fiancée.
Happy Diwali! Happy Diwali!
Happy Diwali!
The maid saw the murderer.
Damn idiot must have
been counting his loot.
Left his fingerprints all over!
And don't forget the bike!
Yes! The Idiot ran away on foot!
Left his motorcycle
behind in his panic.
Scoundrel would've
pissed in his pants.
Please tell Brij Mohan,
I had dropped by.
Excuse me.
The office is closed for Diwali.
Please come back in two days.
I need to meet Ms. Sheetal. Can
you tell me where I can find her?
- Ms. Sheetal?
- Yes.
Why?
I know her. I have
some personal work.
Don't you know? She...
She's dead.
When did this happen?
Eight-ten days ago...
Eight-ten days ago!
Yes.
Such a happy girl, but
she committed suicide...
There she is... Look at that smile.
That's Sheetal?
Yes.
Why?
Is there another girl
named Sheetal who works here?
No, why?
It's all your fault.
Mine?
I was only sent to Manorama's
flat to search for the photos...
If you hadn't
mistaken me for Sheetal,
I wouldn't have had
to play this game.
You are pretty good at games.
You used me for your purpose.
Look - Rathore just wants the
photos. You are in big trouble...
But...
You needn't be if you
just return the photos.
He has the proof with him.
They can prove you
tried to blackmail...
the minister with
the photos for money.
You then tried to involve
Sameera in your little scheme.
And when that didn't work
You killed her and the doctor.
Your motorbike was
found at the scene...
You're doing this for
the money aren't you?
Not everything is done for money.
Happy Diwali, Chief!
Left high and dry are we?
Humpty and Dumpty are here too?
You'd better return
those photographs...
I gave the roll to Manorama.
You know that!
Fond of playing detective,
aren't you?
So go and find the damn photos...
Otherwise, I'll put a
memorial photo of you on the wall.
Understand.
Hello? Nimi?
Happy Diwali.
Oh well. At least you remembered me.
Happy Diwali.
I Know it's late - but I just -
I just wanted to hear your voice.
What's wrong?
Nimi.
I I think I'm in deep trouble.
I told Daddy to have a word
with Mr. Sharma in the department.
No, Mr. Sharma can't do anything.
SY I'm missing you very much.
I wish I was there with you.
Do you remember our Jaipur trip...
Our second honeymoon?
Yes... SV, please come here.
Nimi, I can't come.
Please take care of yourself.
I'll call later. Bye.
Jaipur?
Did you understand, Jaipur?
Please check... Under the
name of Manorama Shukla.
Around the first of November...
Yes, I remember her.
The lady wanted to
process the rolls herself.
Said the photos were private.
Personal.
I loaded the rolls
and then went outside.
That's 350 for two rolls
minus the advance. So - 200.
Two rolls?
She took one with her.
Didn't your wife show them to you?
No.
So, Mr. Randhawa, how was Diwali?
Fine.
Please sit.
I'm trying to quit.
As should I. Nasty habit.
Yes.
Well, I believe you're a
writer of some repute.
I like people like you Who can think.
I think for my people too.
And Sameera...
Any thoughts for her?
Sometimes, personal sacrifices
have to be made for the common good.
Like building a canal that
will never carry any water?
You're a fine one to talk.
Suspended from work
For taking bribes...
Anyhow, let's talk
about other things.
How are Nimi and Raiu
enjoying their holiday in Rohtak?
Like I said, I'm always
thinking about my people.
You disgust me!
You just don't get it,
do you Mr. Randhawa?
You're a small, petty man...
With petty dreams, taking
petty bribes, living a petty life.
The world is divided into
two halves, Mr. Randhawa...
The rulers and the ruled...
The strong and the weak...
The hunter and the hunted.
Now, you can close your
eyes and will it away but
That's the way it's always been
and that's how it always will be.
Call it natural selection
or the law of the jungle.
This is the natural order of things.
And who are you to try and change it?
And what gives you the moral
authority to preach to me.
Truth be told, You remained a
part of the system as long as
it seemed to serve your interests!
Neetu.
Nice, isn't she?
Want her?
Power and money.
It's all about that.
Is this your idea of a joke?
While these photos are
certainly interesting - On the whole
I'm not too amused.
I don't understand...
Don't test my patience, Randhawa.
Now - stop messing with me
and get me those photos.
Manorama wanted me to
take Some other pictures.
The photos that were
in the second roll...
that Manorama took along
with her from the photo studio.
Those photos hid a darker truth
But what was that truth?
Where were those photos?
And what was she trying
to tell me that night?
My life is in danger...
My name is Manorama and I'm 32.
Please remember if
anything happens to me. Please.
Thirty two.
32. Thirty two.
32.
32.
She wasn't filling in an
application form, was she?...
Manorama... just like your book...
Manorama!
32... Page 32.
The Hotel Manager's leery eyes
were glued to
Manorama's voluptuous body.
Grabbing the keys, Manorama started
towards Room 101 with quick steps.
What she didn't know was that
this very room of Hotel Natraj
was going to prove
to be her own coffin.
Today in Rajasthan,
the controversy over
the Rajasthan Vikas
Canal came to an end.
The Opposition parties
have reached an agreement with
the ruling coalition over
the construction of the canal.
In a statement, the leader of the
opposition, Mr. D.K. Saxena said
that the construction would
soon resume keeping in mind
certain objections
that the opposition had...
The fog in my head began to clear.
Manorama's room-mate, the real
Sheetal, worked at the orphanage.
She noticed that little
girls from the orphanage
were being sent to Rathore's house.
Sheetal sensed that
something was wrong...
in the way the minister
interacted with the children...
Not only that, but the orphanage
was an accessory to the fact.
Sheetal voiced her
suspicions to Manorama who decided
to use this information to stop
the construction of the canal.
She hired me but I took
the wrong photographs.
The next day, she went
herself and clicked the photographs
of the minister with
that young girl, Deepti.
That night, something
went horribly wrong and
the little girl died while
at the minister's house.
She was buried in the safest place...
At the canal construction site.
The truth was before me...
the canal construction had stalled.
Then what was that fresh
concrete block doing at the site?
Sheetal knew the truth
so they got rid of her.
Manorama tried to blackmail the
minister with the photographs.
But he was too smart for her.
He faked a meeting to
discuss an amicable settlement...
but instead set his thugs
on her to retrieve the photos.
To acquire the photographs from her...
they beat her mercilessly...
but before they could
locate the photographs...
Manorama escaped and
accidentally died under the truck.
Meanwhile Sameera was
threatening to go public.
And even I was becoming
a headache for Rathore.
The Minister killed
two birds with one stone.
The Minister may have
bought out the opposition,
but if these photos reach the press,
he will be finished Forever!
You're really slow on the
drinks today brother-in-law...
Here, have one more.
There's just one
thing that doesn't fit
How did Manorama...
and Dr Poddar...
Know each other?
How many times did I try
to make you understand...
A little bit of
caution goes a long way!
But you just don't get it.
Hello. Sacred Heart College?
Records department, please.
Let me in.
I have something that
belongs to the Minister.
You can't go inside.
Sir, there is somebody who
wants to meet the minister...
Let him in.
Nimmi had called
She's returning with Raju today.
I saved your life, SV.
They would have killed you.
And your family.
Try to understand. I had
to do it for all of us.
Welcome Mr. Randhawa.
What can I do for you?
The safety catch is on.
Actually, do you even
know what a safety catch is?
You forget Mr. Rathore...
I write detective stories.
Mr. Randhawa, using
your pen is one thing,
Using a gun quite another.
I don't need to use this.
Your fate is already sealed.
Wait in my office. I'll be there.
How's Shakuntala?
Alive.
And you?
I am standing in front of you.
I was eight years old...
This is the only life I've seen.
You could have left
anytime and started afresh.
Who else do I have besides Mr.
Rathore to call my own?
It wasn't ever about
the canal, was it?
Manorama and Dr. Poddar
were brother and sister.
I called the college again.
Manorama Poddar - Batch of 1990.
Manorama also
worked for the Minister.
He needs his 'eyes' and
'ears' inside these NGOs.
But she became obsessed with getting
her brother and Sameera married.
What was it you wanted to tell me?
That she was Manorama
Poddar and not Shukla.
That she didn't
really work for the NGO?
In fact I was the one who...
planted her there. I know.
Neetu told me.
Sit.
So Neetu still takes care of you.
Neetu, show me how
you take care of him.
Show me.
Show me!
Leaving already?
Let me know if you change your mind!
Hey engineer! Look
Superman.
You know that Manorama
was trying to blackmail you
To make you acknowledge
Sameera as your daughter
So that Dr. Poddar and
Sameera could get married.
So?
Even though you beat
Manorama mercilessly for the photos,
She still didn't tell you...
that Dr. Poddar was also
involved in the blackmail plan.
They knew something
about you that you don't.
What?
Your property.
Being the sole heir,
everything would go to Sameera.
And by default, to the
Doctor and Manorama.
They were in a rush...
And the reason for their hurry was
your last health
check up, Mr. Minister.
You have been silently
dying for the last six months.
Cancer. Lung cancer
You really should have quit smoking.
Your doctor knew
but didn't tell you...
He told you that you were suffering
from a minor breathing disorder.
Those injections you were getting...
They just cover up the
symptoms of your cancer.
They wanted to let you die...
You were right.
It's all about power and money.
The natural order of things.
And now?
It's already too late now.
What is it?
Why? What happened?
Spit it.
Spit it.
The big fish doesn't always win.
Sometimes
The little fish, it gets away.
Or an even bigger fish turns up.
The wheel of life
It just keeps on turning.
It just keeps on turning.
Fauji! Fauji's dying!
Fauji!
And that's when I realized that,
in this whole sordid mess
There was only one innocent
just one - and though she was
under six feet of concrete...
She too had a god...
A god who's there for all of us.
And If you really
knock hard and say loudly...
Hello is there anybody home?
It may take a long time,
sometimes a very, very long time
but eventually
somebody's going to answer...
Another wild night?
Eyes...
are thirsty...
thirsty...
Rain is coming...
In the rain of tears there
is a story of happiness...
The flower of happiness has bloomed...
Beloved who was lost in the crown,
I've found him today...
This is a story of love...
Oh darling, let me drink...
the peg of happiness...
Sometimes it rains in November, Nimi.
