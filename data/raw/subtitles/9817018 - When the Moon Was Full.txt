Based on actual events
When the Moon was Full
Set aside ten lipsticks from
Mecca for me.
It has many takers.
Just make sure they’re not old.
- Nothing’s old here. It all goes
fast.
- Give me a discount.
We don’t have discounts on
original items, sorry Mrs.
Mansouri.
- You’re stricter every time I
come back!
- Go get a box from storage.
People usually strike a deal
with their regular customers.
Border agents are stricter.
I don’t have a choice.
- You’ve become strict too.
- Do you want me to play you some
music?
- Finish dealing with me first.
- He went to get them from
storage.
- It’ll take ten minutes.
- How much is this?
You’ve got to be patient.
- You can’t try that on.
- I’ll just draw a line.
- The tip will wear off and no
one will buy it.
- Fine, I’ll take it.
- It’s just that no one will buy
it.
- I’ll take it.
I sold all the L’Oreal hair
dyes.
But you don’t have all the
colors...
Was the lightest one a N-10?
What was the lightest one?
Do you have nail polish too?
- Is that your daughter?
- What?
What do you want with her,
bastard?!

A film by Narges Abyar
Tehran, 2002
Hi. Welcome.
Sorry I’m late, I was training.
How are you?
So one year of talking on
the phone finally paid off?!
Yes.
Welcome, welcome.
Excuse me.
I brought this for Faezeh.
- Thank you.
- It’s nothing.
“My solemn gaze roved
over your innocent face,
it shifted away in shame,
seeking your affection.”
I wrote the poem myself and
had a friend carve it in wood.
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.
- Wonderful! You’re a poet too?
- It’s just a hobby.
I went through something too
and said a few lines like,
-“You said I love you, I said it
soothes your pain...
- Yes.
-“I said I’m broke, she said
what a useless bloke!”
-Shahaab, let us talk.
- We were talking about poetry...
- Your siblings didn’t come?
I would’ve had to rent a bus
there’s so many of them!
- An army from here to there!
- Bless the lord.
- I don’t know what to say...
- Go ahead.
I don’t know how it happened.
I can’t marry off my daughter
faraway.
I only have this one daughter.
It’s hard, we’re from different
cultures.
- My daughter was raised in
Tehran...
- Don’t worry. She’ll get used to it.
- There are many Tehrani brides
there.
- No, it’s just that...
I’m a merchant.
I take things to Pakistan, and
bring things back for
Abdol-Hamid’s store.
My sister Ghamnaz has done
a lot for her children.
We’re worried about
the distance too.
But they want each other.
What can we do?
Abdol-Hamid’s driving us crazy!
They’ve been talking to each
other for a year
and Abdol-Hamid comes to Tehran to see her.
- Do you want them to elope?!
- It’ll be like in Swan Song.
- God forbid!
- Remember the film Swan Song?
Faezeh made that.
All these doilies, the one on
the TV,
the one on the wall, the
cushions,
it’s all made by Faezeh.
- Wonderful!
- My daughter is very talented.
Very nice!
- I don’t know what to say...
- Go ahead.
We don’t have any cases
of divorce in our family.
It’s not nice speaking about
divorce
when you’re here to ask for her hand,
we believe a girl should marry
in white,
and return in a white shroud...
We don’t believe in divorce
either.
The prophet says,
“The most hateful thing to Allah
is divorce.”
- Sir?
- Yes?
Every time someone’s come
to ask for her hand,
I’ve said she can’t leave my
side.
At the most, they can get
a house at the end of the
street.
Yes.
When their father passed away,
may God rest his soul,
I went through great hardships
to raise them.
Until Mousa came into our lives
and took on their
responsibility.
I have always said God sent him
to us.
- He’s been a true father to
them...
- God bless you.
- There’s something else I need
to say.
- Go ahead.
My daughter has a birth defect,
it’s her foot.
Hamid knows, but you should know
too,
because we have nothing to hide...
- That’s okay.
- But she has beautiful eyes.
- Shahaab dear!
- Don’t mention her defect
without her strengths.
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
His mom won’t say a word!
- Girl?
- Yes.
I want to wash up.
It’s the second door to the
right.
My son is no good for you.
Mom!
Mom!
- Yes?
- What did you tell Faezeh?
Do you want to crush me?
Why did you tell her about
Abdol-Vahab?
Why not?
You don’t have a sister.
If you did, I’d thank the person
who’s honest with me.
When she finds out
your eldest brother was killed,
won’t she wonder why we didn’t
tell her?
She’ll never forgive you then.
- What did she say when you told
her?
- Nothing. You’ve stolen her heart!
Mom, look at me.
If this girl doesn’t work out,
I will runaway and get lost.
Zahedan, 3 months later
Buy some lace for
the ceremony in Tehran,
but wear one of these
for the ceremony here.
- How much is it?
- This one?
This is better...
When it’s made into
a dress you’ll look so
beautiful!
I’ll write you a song.
Cover your hair...
Look at that cat.
That’s me, singing for you.
- Should I get it for you?
- No thanks.
Hello?
I’ll be right there.
- Who’s that?
- His younger brother,
Abdol-Majid.
- Should we go say hello?
- No, forget about him.
Why don’t you understand?
It’s below us...
Below us?!
- They’ve agreed. She’ll be my
wife.
- Abdol-Hamid! Abdol-Hamid!
She’s the most important thing
in the world to me.
If you insult her, you’ve
insulted me.
Do you understand?!
You’ve lost the path.
“You, who are so proud of your
name,
if you are not in love, then shame”.
- Get lost.
- When you began playing music,
when you started selling makeup,
I thought you’d become vain,
but I didn’t think you’d sell
your
religion too, for a woman, for the world.
Do you think you’re God’s
only pure creature?
That everyone else is bad and
filthy, but you’re good...
I don’t want to waste my time
arguing.
- I’m saying this for your own
good...
- Yeah, right...
- Love is fleeting...
- Fine.
It lasts six months.
Then you begin to see her
faults.
Especially this one!
She’s not married yet and wears
makeup!
You have no right insulting her.
Don’t mention my wife.
You’re the filthy one...
I got this for you.
Why was it in Shahaab’s room?
I didn’t give it to him.
He borrowed it.
Faezeh shut the door.
Take off your scarf.
I wanna see your hair.
Why not?
- Let’s get married first.
- I really want to see your hair.
My mom says it’s long and curly.
Like a waterfall.
Really?
How wonderful!
I’m so lucky!
Have you washed the tomatoes?
Faezeh where do you belong?
Where?
- What do you mean?
- You belong right here.
-Where?
-Congratulations!
Congratulations!
- Do you want some help?
- Don’t follow everywhere I go.
- Everyone’s looking!
- So what?
It’s not like I’m stealing.
You’re my wife.
I’m gonna stay right here,
let them say what they will.
- Go inside.
- Give it to me.
Go inside!
I’ll soak you!
You’ll catch a cold
on your wedding night!
You made me wet?!
Stop that! Hamid!
What’re you doing?
- Get up!
- She started it.
You shouldn’t do it.
Be the adult.
Take this.
Dry your shirt.
Go behind the wall.
You’re gonna be bride and groom!
- Go behind the wall.
- Sorry!
I almost choked!
“Love sometimes turns into your
hue,
bringing the moments of life in
view”.
- Like it?
- Did you just make that up?
What eyes you have!
They’re like dogs.
- What does that mean?
- They’re like dogs.
They’ve grabbed hold
of my heels and won’t let go.
Like that day at the store.
You grabbed hold of me
and drove me crazy...
- You’ve got a cellphone?
- Saved by the bell!
Hello?
It’s your mom.
How are you?
How’s Mr. Noureddin?
You haven’t left yet?
I know him.
He’s a shopkeeper.
We know.
- We realize it’s a bad time.
- Mousa?
- What’s going on?
- They want to talk to Hamid.
- I’ll be right down.
- His wife will be right down.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- I am Ahmad Abdollahi.
- They want to see Hamid.
We know it’s not a good time.
We didn’t realize.
- We need to ask some questions.
- They were only married a few
hours ago.
It’s an emergency.
- Ms. Mansouri, ask him to come
down.
- How do you know me?
Tell him we just have a few
questions
about Abdol-Malek.
- Who’s Abdol-Malek?
- He knows.
Abdol-Vahed, go inside.
Go dear!
I will help however I can.
- Congratulations on your
wedding.
- Thanks.
- Congratulations Ma’am.
- Thank you.
And about the other thing...
That issue has nothing to do
with him.
We just wanted to see if he could help.
Thank you.
Tell me what’s going
on with your family!
- Please tell me the truth...
- I told you everything.
I am honest with you.
Have I ever lied to you?
It’s my family. What can I do?
- They weren’t like this, but
they changed.
- I have to know what’s going on.
- You’re brother’s called
Abdol-Malek?
- Don’t ask...
- He ran off to Pakistan?
- Don’t ask me...
- Why?
- They told me in there not to
say anything.
Otherwise I’d tell you.
Believe me.
If you don’t trust me I won’t
insist.
But if you want me the way I am,
I’ll do everything for you.
Otherwise I’ll leave.
It’s not too late to separate.
Faezeh...
get in.
It’s delicious.
Have some.
These dresses...
No thanks.
I don’t want any.
- Hello.
- Come in please.
How are you?
So you are Moones.
See what we brought you.
We thought you’d
probably bought a walker,
we brought one in case
someone could use it.
My mother-in-law sent one of
them.
Thank you.
We are alone and poor.
The kids made these.
See if this fits her.
It’s beautiful.
How pretty you look!
- How are you?
- My legs hurt.
God bless you.
Do you like your dress?
Uncle stop! Stop!
Stop that!
- You are our guest.
- We don’t want you to kill it
for us!
But you’re our guest.
They have one goat
and want to cook it for us!
- Are you two sisters?
- How could you tell?
You look alike.
That one’s Preity Zinta’s
choice.
- Who?
- Can I have a tissue?
- Preity Zinta. You don’t know
her?
- No.
She was in that film with the
guy.
What was the name of the film
where they fall in love in
school?
- “Heart”! Have you seen it?
- No.
You’ll laugh for half the film,
and cry at the end.
- Do you watch a lot of movies?
- Yes. It’s my job.
Don’t look at me here.
- I’m into arts. Art, cinema,
camera...
- Hello?
Yes?
How are you?
Do you work in television?
Really?
I’ll be right there!
I want to save cinema...
- Shahaab, close up!
- Why?
- You’re an uncle!
- What?
- You’re an uncle!
- Really?
Thanks ladies!
Excuse me, I didn’t get you
name...
- I’m Golnaz.
- I’m Shahaab. Ask for me when
you call.
- But we want to shop...
- Ladies, cut, straight to
maternity.
- His name’s Saeed?
- Yes.
It’s nice. But if you name him
Amir, Shahrokh, Salman,
when he grows up you can call
him
Amir Khan, Shahrokh Khan, Salman Khan...
- It’s out of my hands. She’s the
boss.
- He’ll be Saeed Khan! It’s gangster!
I wanted my mom to see the baby.
- I haven’t been back home for a
year-and-a-half.
- Don’t give me a guilt trip!
I didn’t say you couldn’t go.
I just want my daughter to be
around.
You can come and go as you
please.
Faezeh should go too.
After all it’s your mom.
- You’ve turned into a man.
- Hi. How are you?
Hello mom.
Hi Ghamnaz,
- hello Noureddin. How are you?
- Hello.
I can smell the wood oven!
You’ve made bread.
- How are you?
- Thank God. How about you?
- Good. And you uncle?
- How are you?
- You didn’t come to Tehran!
- Hello bride.
Hamid, what did you do to
your traditional clothes?
Lose them?
Why didn’t you get a crew-cut?
Here, take some silverware
townie!
You’re an uncle now.
Behave yourself!
What’re they saying?
Tell me?
Behave yourselves.
We have a guest.
- Drink daughter.
- Thank you.
This is for Abdol-Sattar.
Will you give it to him?
- Thank you.
- You don’t deserve it!
- This is for Abdol-Vahed.
- Keep the wrapping paper.
This is for you Ghamnaz.
I looked all over for it.
- Thank you.
- This is for you uncle.
It’s praying beads,
good for everything.
For your health,
kidneys, liver, everything.
- Yes. Thank you very much.
- You’re welcome.
Thanks so much.
It’s beautiful mom.
Thank you.
Try it on and if it doesn’t fit
I will exchange it.
This is for Abdol-Majid.
Excuse me,
this one’s for Abdol-Majid.
Hopefully he’ll repent and come
back.
And this is for Abdol-Ghafoor.
He’s not here.
Uncle! Uncle!
They’ve brought
Abdol-Ghafoor in handcuffs!
What’s going on?
Why won’t you answer?
- Abdol-Ghafoor what have you
done?
- What’s going on?
- I’ll tell you.
- Why’ve you arrested him?
- I’ll tell you.
- What’s he done?
What the hell have you done?!
Calm down.
You won’t let me live
in peace with my family!
- Calm down!
- I’ve had it with you all!
- You were supposed to inform us.
- Do you have a warrant to come
in?!
- Did you forget our deal?
- What’s he done?
- Stockpiled money and weapons.
- What money? What weapons?
Where is it?
There and there.
It’s okay.
Move over.
Higher, higher...
Lower it.
That’s good. Slower, slower.
Don’t cry sweetheart.
Faezeh dear?
Faezeh?
- Faezeh dear?
- Let’s leave right now!
- Right now!
- I swear I didn’t know anything.
- Please don’t say anything to
your family.
- Who are these people?!
- Why are all these weapons in
your house?
- Calm down!
- What’s your family into?
- For the sake of the child.
What I’ve done to deserve this!
You haven’t done anything!
You don’t deserve to be hurt by
my family.
It’s my brother who’s hidden
all these weapons in his yard!
- It has nothing to do with us!
- I don’t know what’ll happen!
I’m worried!
Abdol-Majid called.
He didn’t say anything.
He didn’t say where he was.
- Why didn’t you tell the
agents?!
- It was 18 months ago! What could I say?
- You were supposed to inform
them.
- To get myself in trouble?
I didn’t know anything.
- I’m not a rat. I can’t sellout
my own brother.
- So what did he say?
- Just asked how you were?
- He asked me to send the family
to Pakistan.
- What did you tell him?
- I didn’t agree. I said he was
only trouble.
But now with the situation here,
I think I have to send them.
What about us?
- Sooner or later they’ll come
after us.
- What’s it got to do with us?
-Our life’s got nothing to do
with Abdol-Majid.
-One of your brother’s is dead,
the other ran off to Pakistan,
and
this one’s been arrested for hiding weapons!
You can rest assured your
brother’s troubles will engulf
us too!
What do you want me to do?!
I don’t know!
We need to leave Iran.
The agent said we have to get
away
from Abdol-Majid if we like our life.
Abdol-Hamid, they want you
outside.
Bride, I told you not to come
here.
I didn’t want you to come here
for the birth of the child.
I would’ve sent you your gift.
Don’t come back if you like your
life.
Do you have anything else to
say?!
I apologize.
They’re celebrating the new
office.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
We want to immigrate abroad...
- To Europe.
- To Europe.
We came here to use your
expertise.
We know many people there,
from Baluchistan and Pakistan.
Many of our relatives have gone
to England.
My wife just mentioned
they are doing well there...
Listen, it’s different from
Pakistan.
It’s difficult, you need money,
and it’s unpredictable.
Do you know any English?
- No... a little bit.
- That’s bad.
- England has the toughest asylum
laws.
- What if we apply from the UAE, from Dubai?
It’s no different from Iran.
It’s still close by
and your family can show up.
Sir, we are different from the
others.
One of his brothers has been
killed,
one has run away to Pakistan,
and the other is awaiting
execution in prison.
We are in a dangerous situation.
We’re not makin
it up just to go abroad.
I’m afraid.
I’m afraid for my family.
We want to go
somewhere no one can reach us.
- Which UN office do you want to
apply from?
- Pakistan.
Not Pakistan.
You wanna go straight to your
brothers?
- Then where?
- No way.
I know people there.
I don’t know anyone in Europe.
Listen, given what you’ve told
me
I think you should apply from
Pakistan.
Want some yoghurt?
- Is that all you’re eating.
- Mom stop giving me a hard time.
- He wants to watch his figure.
- What’re you talking about?
A boy as tall as you needs
to eat until his jaw goes stiff.
- You’ve got to eat like a hog.
- Then I won’t have a six-pack
anymore.
- A what?
- Six-pack.
You need an asset to make money.
It’s not working out like this.
As soon as I start making some
money
and getting established, I’ve got to move.
I need to talk to my mom to
give me my share of the house.
I’m going to Pakistan to see
if my uncle will allow it or
not.
How was that?
I brought up the subject.
- My mom’s very smart.
- I didn’t want to lie to her. I
had to do it.
What excuse could
I give for going to Pakistan?
- We’ve got to change our SIM
cards.
- What for?
It might be hacked.
If they learn we’re leaving Iran
or going
to Pakistan we may get into trouble.
She won’t believe you’re going
to Pakistan for your uncle’s
permission.
I’m worried
about you crossing the border!
It’s dangerous!
I’m nervous!
- I was born on the border!
- Stop joking!
Do you want me to stay?
I’ll do whatever you say.
Leave that and come here.
Do you know how difficult it is
for me to part from you?
- We’ve been together since our
wedding.
- How long will it take?
- How long will you have to stay?
- I don’t know.
But it’ll be easier for me in
Pakistan.
The worst thing is that Majid is
there.
I’m scared.
What if it turns out bad for us?
Don’t worry about Abdol-Majid.
And don’t worry about me.
We’ll get away from them
and go to Europe.
Smile for me and let me look at
you.
Give me a smile.
Smile.
Where do you belong?
No, show me,
where do you belong?
Faezeh can’t we do something
so I can come with you?
You’re not going anywhere! No
where!
You have to stay with mom. Hear me?
Put it out of your head.
Are you planning on killing
her?!
I have to go for certain
reasons.
I know why and
you don’t need to know.
I have to take my husband
and son and leave this
continent.
The continent?!
Hello? Hamid?
How are you?
- What?
- I talked to a lawyer.
He says you need to be here
to make things work.
Stop that Hamid!
That wasn’t our plan.
You said you knew someone
and could get it done.
You have to come to the UN
office in Pakistan.
I wrote in the forms that
we escaped together from Iran.
They wouldn’t believe me if I
hadn’t.
The agent asked where you were
and
I said you were home with the child.
He says you have to come for an
interview.
- Listen Faezeh...
- Hamid I can’t!
- I can’t get mom to approve.
- I’ll deal with her.
I’ll make arrangements at the
border
to safely cross you over.
I’m scared to come.
- Pack up! Let’s go! Let’s go!
- Wait a second.
- They’re terrifying me!
- Mom, wait a second.
I’m going!
- I’m not listening to this
stuff!
- Mom you don’t need to burst a pipe!
- Mom, what’re you doing?
- Why’re you so against it.
Let them try and go, maybe
I can go with them to study...
- Stop talking!
- Maybe we’ll come back and take
you!
I went through hell to raise
you!
We want to leave for the future
of our child.
Maybe things will be better over
there.
Who knows if we’ll even get
refugee status?
- So you planned to trick me with
Hamid?
- What trick?!
- Where’re you going? The
concrete factory?!
- Went to Pakistan to get his uncle’s approval!
None of my friends who left have
regretted it.
I said my daughter had to stay
nearby!
- I said you’d stay in Tehran!
- Yes you did.
- And now this?!
- It was my suggestion.
- Nicely done!
- Mom!
- I won’t forgive you if you go!
- Mom!
We’ve made up our minds.
You lied to me.
- You have to get her consent.
- She doesn’t know about Hamid’s
brothers.
She’ll raise hell and
get your divorce if she finds
out!
She shouldn’t find out.
If she does, she’ll never
forgive Hamid.
- Mom has to deal with it.
- How?
- You’ve got to go.
- I say you shouldn’t go.
- Listen to me for once.
- I want to go.
- I’m worried like this.
- There’s only one way.
Call her from Pakistan
and say you’re there.
She’ll never forgive me!
I’m too scared to go...
- I’ll come with you.
- I can’t.
This way mom will be less
worried too.
What do you think?
- It makes sense.
- You can’t come.
- What’ll my husband think?
- Listen to her! She doesn’t want
me there.
He’s not gonna stay there.
I’ll hand you over
to your husband and come back.
It’s Pakistan, it’s not like
you’re going to Paris!
Pakistan, Quetta, 2005
Look at that!
You’re only one and travelling
abroad!
Welcome!
Come in Faezeh.
If this is Pakistan,
imagine what Canada’s like!
Look at this house!
- It’s like Amir Khan’s in
“Heart”.
- It’s big isn’t it?
- Yeah.
- Not like the beehives in
Tehran.
It’s cool.
Give that to me.
That’s the kitchen.
It’s a bit messy.
Why did you get a place so big?
- We’re not staying long.
- It belongs to a relative.
They left Pakistan
and said we could stay here.
And this is our place.
Looks like a sports stadium!
They knew we wouldn’t stay long
so it’s not fully furnished.
Shahaab come here.
- There’s a small bed in here for
you...
- I’ll sleep in front of the TV.
- Noureddin’s praying. I’ll show
you later.
- You’ve got a VCR...
- You can’t.
- And a hookah pipe too!
You’ve got to go in there at
night.
We don’t have a bedroom.
The rooms are locked.
They’ve built a wall and
my brothers are downstairs.
- It’s got plenty of space.
- Your brothers? You mean Majid?
- No Abdol-Vahed and the others.
- Why did you grow a beard?
For the sorrow of being away
from you.
You don’t like it?
No.
Oh no! Give me your phone.
I’ve got to call mom!
- Have you got any Bollywood
films here?
- Don’t touch those. They’re not mine.
It’s personal films?
How does this work?
Pull up its antenna.
I’ve got a child, a husband.
I’ve got to think about my own
life.
Stop screaming!
Please stop mom.
It would be nice if younger
folks
listened to their elders.
Ghamnaz!
What’re you doing here?
You’re so covered up!
Did you all come here?
Why didn’t Hamid say anything?
Why didn’t you listen to me?
I told you not to come here.
I didn’t know you were in
Pakistan.
I called several times
but you didn’t answer.
- Have you moved here for good?
- I don’t know.
My sons brought me here.
I don’t know if we’ll stay or
go.
Hi mom.
- How are you? Where were you?
- I went to visit the sick.
Why didn’t you tell me your
family was here?
I didn’t think it was important.
Of course it makes a difference!
I wouldn’t try so hard to come
here.
I’ve been through so much for
you!
You can’t give it all up so
easily.
Let’s go out.
Come have some tea
when you’re done.
I didn’t meet this brother.
What happened to him?
He was martyred in Afghanistan,
fighting the Americans.
They said we’ve got to wait.
But how long?
- I wish they’d tell us.
- We don’t have a choice.
But it’ll be great if we can go
to England.
We’ve got family there.
What’s this smell?
I’m going to get sick!
They’re cooking Beryooni.
You used to like it.
I’ll go back to Iran in a day or
two.
I’ve imposed on you enough.
I’ve been here a month!
- You’re like a brother it’s not
an imposition.
- Thanks.
If you stay we may be able
to immigrate together.
No, he’s got to go. Mom is
alone.
Don’t even mention it!
Moussa is with your mom.
And if he goes back he’ll have
to go do his military service.
This is a small town.
He’ll get bored soon.
He can go to Karachi.
I’ve got a friend there.
He sells cosmetics and is doing
well.
He can go work there until
our paperwork comes through.
- Cool! High five!
- High five!
- Bro!
- Don’t do this.
- I’ve got to tell mom first.
- Tell mom what? What’s she gonna
say?
- She wants my progress doesn’t
she?
- Progress?!
Yes progress!
Anil Kapoor was a doorman,
Raj Kapoor was a guard,
Jim Carrey was a construction
worker...
- Shahrokh Khan?
- no, Shahrokh Khan was a
rich kid...
- Really?
- Yes, I’ve done the research.
Help him.
Empty the cars.
Abdol-Sattar, hurry,
come here
What’re you doing?
Come here!
- Saeed’s sleeping.
- Why’ve you locked the doors?
I didn’t want anyone to walk in.
Don’t worry.
My brothers won’t just walk in.
They know we’re here.
You look pretty.
You looked like a pearl before,
but now you’re like the full
moon.
Let me go wash up.
- What news of the UN?
- Nothing.
Don’t go outside looking like
that.
Not for anything.
I can’t bear being apart.
God has given both life and
death,
it gets decided on the battlefield brothers.
All those who speak
of other gods, of dissent,
of blasphemy,
will not be able to withstand
Allah...
Come here! Come here!
Do you know what your sons are
doing?!
You know and you keep silent?!
Look at this! Look!
They killed two soldiers just
like that!
You can’t change anything.
I couldn’t.
You can’t either.
A woman’s words are worthless,
whether a mother or a wife.
- This was my fate.
- Why didn’t you warn me?!
Why didn’t you tell me
not to come into this hell?
I thought his brothers were into
drugs!
I had no idea it was this
stuff...
I don’t have a phone!
They didn’t give me one.
I told you not to come.
What else could I say?
Please, tell me.
Is Hamid like Abdol-Majid too?
Whose house is this?
Abdol-Majid’s?
It’s Abdol-Majid’s house,
but he never comes here.
He has his own house.
He’s changed.
He’s become wild.
At first he studied religion.
Then he joined Al-Qaeda.
He knew the border and
smuggled Al-Qaeda forces into
Iraq.
They gave him money
and he bought guns.
The Iranian government found out
so he escaped here.
Now he’s somebody for himself.
He’s separated from Al-Qaeda.
They call him Malek.
Abdol-Malek.
Even God can’t
stand up to him now.
Hamid wasn’t like this.
He was different from his
brothers.
He’s still different.
Noureddin thinks Abdol-Majid’s
a drug smuggler.
I’m afraid to tell him.
Take your child and go away.
Who knows how Abdol-Hamid will
turn out?
Abdol-Majid does everything for
him,
and makes him indebted.
I’ve buried three sons so far,
and one’s in prison.
With what Abdol-Majid’s doing,
I’ll lose the rest of them too.
The most innocent of them died
in front of my eyes.
There’s nothing worst in the
world
than knowing your children are in the wrong.
I’ve become disgraced in the
tribe.
You’re their mother.
You brought them into the
world...
I am God’s helpless creature.
Al-Qaeda believes a woman
is less than the dirt you walk
on.
Abdol-Majid and his brothers
have been brainwashed.
They believe in these things.
They believe they are soldiers
of God.
It means they have to sacrifice
their mothers, fathers, wives
and children.
They have violated Islam.
They think everyone is wrong
except for them.
They believe it’s a good deed
if they kill others.
There is unemployment
and poverty here.
The young are unemployed.
They have nothing to eat.
So they turn to smuggling drugs.
But no one asks why they turn to
drugs,
or why they become fanatics...
They put a bullet in the
soldiers’ brains.
- They killed them...
- You and I don’t understand
these things.
- You have to go back to Iran.
- We’re trying to get paperwork
to leave...
Who knows when that will happen,
and what’ll happen to
Abdol-Hamid by then.
I will arrange everything.
Don’t say a word until I tell
you.
And don’t call anyone.
They’ve bugged the phones.
Faezeh dear, get my towel.
There’re two babies on the way.
Congratulations.
Congratulations dear!
You’re having twins!
-It’ll make our immigration more
difficult.
-No,
it’ll make things better.
It’ll make it easier.
This is for you.
A lady who makes beautiful
babies
should wear a gold watch.
- Where did you get the money?
- This place is a family hangout.
We know the owner.
Do you believe I used to work
here?
Before selling cosmetics...
Where did you get the money
for the watch?
My brothers owed me some money
and gave some of it back.
They’ll give the rest before we
go.
- Hello?
- Faezeh, hi.
Hi mom. How are you?
How’s Moussa?
- Give her my regards.
- Hamid says hello.
What’s wrong sweetheart?
Are you unwell?
No, I’m okay.
Hamid’s brought me to a
restaurant.
Saeed’s fine, he’s with Ghamnaz.
The news keeps showing bombings
and killings in Sistan and
Baluchistan.
They say it’s Abdol-Malek Rigi.
Moussa said he might be Hamid’s
relative.
Is that true?
- Their last name is Rigi too.
- I don’t know mom.
The Rigi’s are a big tribe in
Baluchistan.
And they’re all nice people.
You can’t blame them all for one
bad apple.
Hamid is careful.
He’s against Abdol-Malek.
All the Rigis are against him
too.
Don’t worry.
- Hamid’s family is very nice to
me.
- I’m worried honey.
It’s okay mom.
Hamid is careful.
He’ll take care of us.
He’s very excited that I’m
pregnant.
Send Shahaab back.
I keep telling him but he won’t
listen.
He says he’s making good money.
- Okay sweetheart, I’ll call
later.
- Okay, bye.
- Did you hear what she said?
- How could I hear?
Is Abdol-Malek Rigi your
brother?
Is it Majid?
Say something!
I’m scared.
I never imagined your brother
would be a member of Al-Qaeda!
Did my mom tell you?
Hamid are you involved with him?
- What if he comes after you?
- He’s not Al-Qaeda!
He’s his own man.
Everyone here respects him.
All I care about is leaving.
You’re holding my leash thank
God!
We’ll go live in peace
in a corner of the world.
Can you arrange things
so I could go back to Iran soon?
What?
Are you threatening me?!
I just want to eat my damn
lunch!
My brothers are behind that
wall.
You don’t need to go there.
That’s your room.
I’ll show you.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- How are you mom?
- Good.
Hi Faezeh.
I’ve brought help.
Her name’s Asil.
She’ll come in the mornings
until 5.
That’s good with my aching leg,
she can help take care of the
place.
She can’t talk. She’s a mute.
Are you okay Faezeh?
This is my mom.
She’ll tell you what to do.
I’m going to Karachi tomorrow.
I’m taking a letter to the UN
office there.
I may check up on Shahaab too.
- Give that.
- Hello.
Thank you.
- When are you leaving?
- When Behrouz tells me.
- I’ll buy some cigarettes.
- Stay here.
Don’t get out, even if Saeed
cries.
- I’ll go get you some snacks.
- Thank you.
Let’s call your uncle.
Abdol-Majid what are you doing?
Stop! Wait!
Get out!
Let her go!
Hamid!
Open the door!
Ghamnaz! Open the door!
Why have you locked me in?
Hamid, open up!
Open the door!
Open it!
Open it!
Open it!
Faezeh! Are you okay?
Son, take your wife and leave.
Don’t destroy yourself.
Don’t follow Malek.
He’s insane.
He’s a murderer.
He thinks he’s doing the right
thing,
but he’s killed innocent people.
Don’t you believe
in Mowlana Abdol-Hamid?
God says he will let you
in heaven for your deeds.
If you commit murder,
you will not get in...
-You’ve been like a father to
me,
-Listen to me!
But you wanted to take my wife
away from me. I won’t forgive
you.
Thank God.
- What happened?
- It’s because of stress.
It’s dangerous for her and the
babies.
She shouldn’t get stressed.
She’s okay now.
Nothing to worry about.
Bye.
Mom, take Saeed.
- Are you better?
- How is Noureddin?
- They shot him in the leg!
- Don’t worry about him.
- It’s just a scar.
- Why do you lock the door?
- Because my wife’s trying to run
away.
- Don’t you wonder why I want to run away?
I don’t know.
I’ve provided everything for
you.
I don’t know why you want to run away.
- What have I done to you?
- I don’t want this comfort!
I just want a quiet life.
Without any hassles.
- To raise our children.
- What hassles?
I’ve agreed to everything you’ve
wanted!
- You wanted to leave Iran, and I
agreed...
- Let’s go back to Iran.
I’m not your plaything!
We’ve gone this far...
Tell me why you wanted to run
away
and take my children from me?
- Abdol-Malek knew you better
than I did.
- Malek!
- He told me not to trust you.
- If he knew anything
he wouldn’t kill people!
He wouldn’t murder his own
countrymen!
- He wants to defend the
Baluchis.
- Defend the Baluchis?!
Isn’t your uncle a Baluch?
And all those people who’ve been
killed?
And you repeating his words!
The Baluch are kind, don’t you
remember
how they treated us on our honeymoon?
They had one lamb and wanted to
cook it for us.
They honor their guests.
- They don’t murder people in
God’s house.
- You wanted to steal my children!
To rob me of what I love!
Why didn’t you ask yourself why
I wanted to get away from this
hell!
- Hell?!
- Why your mother took my side!
- Have you asked yourself that?
- Is this a hell to you?
Someone who kills innocent
people
can also kill me and my children!
Malek didn’t kill anyone.
They were all infidels.
How can you say such a thing?
My brother Malek.
Just see how many followers he
has.
You’re inciting me against my
brother.
You think you can do that
just because I love you?
Malek has proof in the Quran
for everything he says.
He has studied religion.
He was in Al-Qaeda and studied
Islam.
He didn’t just recite the Quran.
Listen,
I’m not part of Malek’s group.
I don’t have the guts for it.
I wish I had a bit of his
courage,
or was as strong as him.
But I’m thankful just for a gulp
of water.
All I do is for the sake of our
children.
I’m selfish enough to think of
myself.
It’s best if I go live with you
abroad.
I know myself.
Try to be good.
Don’t cry.
Look at me.
Look at me.
See what you’ve done to
yourself.
But your eyes are even
more beautiful when you cry.
Cry for me.
A bit more.
More.
Now get ready,
let’s go out to lunch.
Don’t get upset but
I don’t have an appetite.
You have to eat.
Think of the babies in your
belly.
Eat, it’s good.
Put some of this one it.
You like it.
Put some of this on.
Maybe you’ll eat then.
Can’t we apply for refugee
status
from Turkey instead of Pakistan?
For the love of God,
let’s eat in peace!
Eat.
Take a bite.
You’ve brought the prisoner for
a break?
- She was trying to run away!
- She wasn’t running away...
- What if she’s an enemy agent?
- My wife is totally honest with
me.
Did you know Iranian
Intelligence
has been to see them?
After your wedding?
They came to see me.
You were already in Pakistan.
- Don’t you believe me?
- So why was she trying to run
away?
She’s been home the entire time.
Think about what you’re saying.
Noureddin planned it.
Our mom put it in her head,
encouraging her to run away.
Why doesn’t our mother
run away herself?
It’s not Faezeh’s fault.
Are you insane?
Enemy agent!
She was stupid,
but forgiveness is a virtue.
- Mowlana Abdol-Hamid says...
- His path is separate from ours.
We follow our own path,
do you understand?
This is not the place to talk.
We’ll meet and
I’ll make you understand.
Hamid!
Hamid!
Ghamnaz!
Asil!
Hello?
- Hamid? Where are you?!
- Is that you Faezeh?
Saeed isn’t here!
I woke up and saw he was gone!
- Where are you calling from?
- Downstairs.
- Why are you there?
- I looked everywhere!
My son’s missing.
He’s disappeared!
Don’t worry.
He’s with me.
You were sleeping so I didn’t
wake you.
He’s with me.
He should be around men a while.
And you’ll be able to rest.
We don’t want him to get spoilt.
Faezeh, don’t worry, he’s safe.
Yesterday a 15-year-old
suicide-bomber
did an operation in Zahedan.
Ghamnaz!
I am responsible
for the blood that is shed.
It is not a joke.
You can see the film.
I put it by the TV
Take a look and see how his
friends
sent him away with joy,
so he could join
the Prophet in heaven.
- But I don’t have the courage.
- Asil!
I’ll keep my word and
build a comfortable life for
you.
But I don’t deserve this
comfort.
More and more I believe
what Majid says is true.
I don’t have the courage for
Jihad,
but I shouldn’t be against it either.
How will I answer
the martyrs in the afterlife?
Where’s Ghamnaz?
Where’s my mother-in-law?
Talk to me!
Where is Ghamnaz?!
Where is Noureddin?!
Talk!
Are you pretending to be mute?!
Are you one of them?!
Are you?!
Are you?!
Approaching the area 30 minutes
before the operation.
Preparing for the greatest
attack
by Jundallah, led by Abdol-Malek...
Jihad, war, and killing
God’s enemies are a necessity.
We have to fight old and new
infidels.
Islam is a religion of war, not peace.
Those who want to combine Islam
with
liberalism, democracy, and peace, are infidels,
it is our obligation to kill
them.
The war with infidels is between
good and bad.
The world is with us or against us.
A world of infidels or Islam.
Those who pretend to be
believers,
but sit at a table with infidels,
it doesn’t matter if they are
Fars or Baluch,
they are all infidels at the tip of our swords.
Ask God to accept every bullet
you fire.
Brother, don’t allow fear to get
into you.
Let’s praise Allah and begin our
work.
[Operation by Jundallah forces
led by
Abdol-Malek Rigi in Tasouki]
Get down! Get down!
Hurry!
- Women to the right!
- Women and children on this
side!
Hurry!
Hurry!
You used to sell CDs on street
corners!
- I don’t need to answer you.
- You are not one of us! You are
not a Baluch!
- I am defending the Baluch.
- You are defending us with a
gun?
Shut up.
I won’t do anything to the
women.
- Do you love your country?
- We are defenders of the
country.
You are an infidel!
Get down!
Hurry!
Down! Down!
- I said get down!
- Get down!
Tie him!
This one too!
- What do you do?
- I’m a student.
- What do you study?
- I’m a student.
But you’re as old as my dad!
- Where is your father?
- My father is dead.
Why are you going to Zahedan?
What’s your name?
What do you do?
I’m a worker.
I want some meat.
My phone is out of charge.
Can I call?
Hello? Shahaab?
I don’t have time.
I’ve sneaked out to call you.
I’m locked up in the house!
I’m a prisoner!
They’ve taken Saeed from me...
They are dangerous people.
Hamid has joined them too.
They’ve taken Saeed from me
because
they know I can’t leave without him.
Don’t do that!
They’ve got many supporters.
Don’t tell anything to your
boss!
Get back to Iran however you can.
They’re very dangerous.
They have weapons.
They smuggle and have money.
I’m trapped because they have my
son.
Just save yourself.
If you see mom and Moussa,
tell them to pray for me.
Help!
Help!
- Get him out.
- Hurry!
Walk!
- Bring him here!
- You’ve made a mistake!
I swear you’ve made a mistake!
Listen to me!
Why’ve you tied up my relative?
Untie him.
I’m Abdol-Majid.
Your sister’s brother-in-law.
Get him some water.
How’s work?
How’s Karachi?
Getting paid well?
They didn’t know we’re family.
If you want I can punish them.
- No.
- Believe me.
They didn’t do anything.
I miss Saeed.
I’ve bought him a ton of toys.
All guns.
Military stuff.
He has to practice,
get used to guns.
- Do you want anything?
- A cigarette.
- They emptied my pockets.
- Who?
Who took his cigarettes?
- Give them back.
- It was him.
Here.
- Did I take them by force?
- Yes.
Thanks.
I don’t want any.
I know you said you’d kill us
because
you were upset about your sister.
You wouldn’t kill your sister’s
husband,
making her children orphans.
I know it’s not like that.
The entire world knows me now.
Everyone wants to meet me.
Why?
Because they believe in what I
do.
They believe in me.
As you can see, when your sister
called and you planned to kill
us...
- No.
- But we found out.
I swear.
My sister called and was crying.
- I got upset when I heard her
voice.
- Shahaab, Hamid and I like you.
You’re family.
We think you can turn
into a true fighter for God.
We’re all Muslims and
must fight our true enemies.
You’re not a prisoner.
I told them to bring you here
so we could talk.
I want to tell you
we’re not dangerous.
We only obey God’s rules.
You wanted to go to the
Consulate?
We control everything here.
I can even send you to Germany.
I have people.
I’ll do it for you.
- My sister and her children?
- With her children,
and her husband Abdol-Hamid.
He insists on going
and living among infidels.
Let him go, I don’t care.
I believe you can be a fighter
for God.
But if you want to leave,
that’s okay.
I’ll send you.
You just have to do one thing
for me.
Five people were martyred,
and 120 injured.
I had to collect two brothers,
15 and 17-years-old...
- Where’s this cream from?
- I don’t know?
- Does it clump on the face?
- Not if you apply some
moisturizer first.
Their operations
will destroy Baluchistan.
- How much for the lipstick?
- Which one?
- 1,500.
- It’s expensive.
It’s the last of Hamid’s
supplies.
Some people have been
martyred...
- How much for the nail polish?
- Which one?
550.
Hello?
Hello?
- Can you speak a bit louder?
- How are you?
- You don’t know me?
- You are?
I’m Abdol-Majid,
Hamid’s brother.
How are you?
How come you’ve called me?
Any news of Faezeh?
She won’t pick up when I call.
I’m very busy
and haven’t seen Faezeh.
-But I have news of Shahaab.
He’s fine.
-Thank God.
Neither Faezeh nor Shahaab
answer their phones.
They’re probably so happy
they’ve forgotten all about
their mother.
Shahaab is fine and says hi.
He’ll be on TV tonight at 8.
- On channel Al-Arabiah.
- What?
Watch Al-Arabiah tonight,
they’ll be showing Shahaab.
Has he acted in a film?
Hello?
Majid?
I will say these things
so my sister can go back to
Iran.
You promised me.
I’ll feel better when she
returns.
You can send me afterwards.
- And you’ll send Saeed with her?
- Rest assured. What I say goes.
Thank you.
Tell him to connect the
satellite.
Let’s see what they’ll show.
I’ll keep Ghodrat’s wife and
kids.
His sister? It’ll by five of
them,
and four more.
That’s okay.
I’ll make a stew.
If I say something wrong,
stop and I’ll do it again.
If I wasn’t good, I’ll go like
this
and we can do a retake.
We can do as many retakes as you
want.
You’re ready.
One …
Two, Three, go.
In the name of God...
You should’ve waited
before serving the food.
We could watch the news first.
I didn’t want the rice to get
cold.
- Go ahead and eat.
- We could’ve had dinner 20
minutes later.
- I’ve already served. Please
eat.
- How come Shahaab’s going to be on TV?
- Is he an actor now?
- I don’t know. He said it’s an
interview.
- Hopefully it’s good news.
- Hurry, it’s starting.
I’m coming.
Take this.
It’s starting.
I, Shahaab Mansouri, and my
sister
Faezeh Mansouri, live in Pakistan.
We are spies. Our intention was
to spy
on Jundallah for the Iranian government.
- What’s going on?
- We came here to kill this
group’s fighters.
But thankfully we were captured.
- I repent and ask God’s
forgiveness.
- What’s going on?!
Oh lord! Oh God!
- It’s my son! It’s Shahaab!
- Oh God!
Oh God!
My son!
My son! Stop!
Stop!
Hello.
Where is he?
God save us.
What’ve you done?
Why did you kill him?!
How can I look at Faezeh now?
- You’ve committed a sin. You’re
cruel!
- What did you expect me to do?
The Baluch are good people.
They are honest.
You are evil!
You’re not one of us!
You took it out on him.
He wanted to come to Europe with
us.
He didn’t think this would happen to him.
You hated that family form the
start.
They gave me their daughter.
- That confession was your
excuse?
- Why do you keep defending them?
I’ve made you my
second-in-command.
You’re my replacement.
You want proof?
Shahaab had said he’d kill us.
He said he’ll rat us out.
I saved your life.
Do you still need a reason?
The hell with him, the bastard!
I’ll kill him.
- I swear I’ll kill him. Just
wait and see.
- Listen to me!
What did we ever do to them?
Was there an Abdol-Malek among
his brothers?
Run away.
Don’t stay there a minute
longer.
Don’t worry. Don’t worry
sweetheart.
I’ll take care of everything.
- I’ll go to the consulate.
- Don’t! They have many
supporters...
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Sweetheart!
I missed you!
My love!
You’re giving me the cold
shoulder?
It’s me, the one you used to
love.
You used to make me cards.
Remember?
Faezeh?
I love my life,
I love my wife, my children.
- I’m not cut out for Jihad.
- Stop lying!
I saw you in the film.
You were absorbed by Malek’s
words.
- I saw with my own eyes.
- I didn’t do anything. I swear.
I didn’t kill anyone.
I just went because Malek asked
me.
- It doesn’t make a difference.
- He ordered me to go.
Ordered you?
What’s that mean?
- Who does he think he is?
- He is the Amir. Everyone calls
him Amir.
- You participated in the
slaughter...
- No I didn’t. I swear.
- I didn’t do anything. I didn’t
kill anyone.
- I don’t understand Malek’s God.
We have grown distant from each
other.
You have grown distant from me,
from your life, from Islam, from
humanity.
- I am ashamed to love you
anymore...
- Please don’t say that!
Let me call my mom and
hear her voice.
Don’t worry them.
Don’t leave me alone
with these guards.
Let me leave.
Let me go back to Iran.
I don’t know how these babies
will turn out with what I’ve
been through!
Or just kill me and get it over
with.
Prove to your brother that
you’re no less than him.
Some of my brother’s guys
have American residency.
I’ve talked to them.
They’re going to help us go to
America.
- We’ll go away and live in
peace.
- You talk like a child.
I won’t be happy even in heaven.
If you really love me
come back to Iran with me.
Let’s go before your spill
any more innocent blood.
I’ll be executed in Iran,
with the things
Abdol-Malek has done,
I can’t stand this anymore!
4 months later
We can get here.
Is it good?
They have to be careful...
Be careful.
-Yes?
-I sent three teams of two to
Iran yesterday,
they were arrested by Iranian
Intelligence.
- Really? Will they give them
information?
- No they won’t.
Most are only working with us
for money.
- I use them as smugglers.
- They don’t believe...
- I think we have an informer.
- Why’re you telling me?
Maybe you think it’s me?
Are you pointing at her now?
She’s been locked in the house.
How can she give you away?
You killed her brother and
now it’s her turn?
She’s about to give birth!
I haven’t let her find out
about Shahaab or she’d die of
grief.
I won’t kill her. You will.
It’s an order.
We’ve been ambushed!
It’s an ambush!
Go!
Bastard!
Go!
Don’t let the government forces
in!
Abdol-Vahed hurry!
Hurry!
Go!
Bastards!
Infidels!
Abdol-Vahed!
No!
You killed him!
Jihad is for the obliteration of
governments that don’t follow
God’s laws.
Every government outside
Islam is infidel,
and its only path to salvation
is Jihad.
Muslims must never give up on
Jihad.
Friends sometimes ask,
why I violate, hang, decapitate.
The answer is we do all this to
draw
greater numbers of enemies to the field.
With more enemies
we can kill more people.
This will please God
and anger the infidels.
The ignorance now is
greater than it was before
Islam.
The world is filled with
corruption.
The world is filled with sin.
People commit sins without fear
of God.
We can either have a world
of sin or a world of Islam.
They cannot go side by side.
They are in complete
disagreement.
Muslims must fight infidelity
with all their might.
They must fight with their
beliefs.
Without purity,
God will abandon us.
And if God abandons us
victory will be difficult.
Don’t be afraid of martyrdom.
Don’t be afraid of death.
It is the moment when
you will join God and the
Prophet.
I have lost three brothers on
this path.
The last one, my youngest
brother
Abdol-Vahed, was martyred yesterday.
You left our brother behind?
Don’t say anything to Ghamnaz.
She shouldn’t find out.
What did you do to Noureddin?
What does one do
with an insubordinate?
I didn’t want to see him.
Blood is being shed every day
and we’re still asleep.
Abdol-Hamid, three people
want to meet me in Morocco.
No one knows I am going there.
I have told everyone that
you are in charge.
You are the commander.
I don’t have any other
brother that I trust.
After your children are born you
won’t
have an excuse for not killing their mother.
Is Saeed homesick?
- No, he’s not like you.
- I’ve made up my mind.
I’ll send Faezeh to Iran.
She’s the mother of my three
children.
I will forgive her.
She has information about us.
Once she gets to Iran we have
to wait to die at our home.
Your wife knows
you took part in my missions.
Just imagine if she finds out
we killed Shahaab.
She will want to kill you,
to destroy you.
Trust your Amir.
I only want your good.
Yes?
What?
When did they take her?
They’ve taken my wife to the
hospital.
No.
I’ll leave now.
Bye.
You can’t go anywhere today
and tomorrow.
We have lots to do.
Send Ghamnaz to be with your
wife.
Bring our mother back soon
so she doesn’t do anything.
Assign some men to guard the
hospital.
Ghamnaz!
I’m glad to see you.
- There’s no one else I can
trust.
- It’s okay.
Everything will be okay.
The babies are two months
premature.
But they’re okay.
They are in the incubator.
What news do you have?
Where did they take you and
Noureddin?
How is my son?
Noureddin’s disappeared.
They took him away.
But don’t worry about it.
Think about yourself.
They haven’t allowed me
to call anyone for months.
I couldn’t.
They took away my phone,
and my TV.
Can you give me my phone
so I can call my mom?
- To let her know how I am.
- I don’t have a phone. They took
mine too.
- Someone is waiting for you in
the lobby.
- I’ll be right there.
Please don’t go!
Can’t you stay?
No.
I’ve been here since last night.
They’re afraid to leave me with
you.
Why do you care about me so
much?
I never did anything for you.
You stood up to your son for me.
What’s wrong is wrong.
It doesn’t matter
if it’s your son or a stranger.
I feel shame toward you.
I didn’t do anything for you.
You were a guest but
I didn’t take care of you well.
I was a prisoner myself.
You’re the only reason
I haven’t tried to runaway from
here.
Yes?
Hi.
At dawn?
The children are in incubators?
I’ll come, tomorrow.
You have to change your room.
Get up on this.
- Where are you taking me?
- We’ll talk outside.
I’ve seen you before.
We have to get out first.
Then we’ll explain everything.
Don’t show any reaction.
There are cameras.
- What about my children?
- They have to stay in the
hospital.
I don’t understand.
You’re not bringing my children?
- You won’t bring my children?
- No.
Malek is going to kill you.
We’ve risked our lived to save
you.
- My children?! Sir?
- They won’t do anything to your
children.
Please be quiet, we’ll talk when
we
get out of here.
It was you in the bazaar that
day?
- We’ve been after them all this
time.
- You’re lying!
- Then why haven’t you captured
them?
- Abdol-Malek was at the pizza place you went.
- So why didn’t you do anything?
- I had him in view.
I don’t believe it!
Why didn’t you do anything?
- His brain would’ve splattered
all over his son.
- Why didn’t you tell me at Ghamnaz’s house?!
- I wouldn’t be here now if you’d
told me!
- I didn’t have permission.
I don’t want to leave my
children.
Be quiet!
Let me go!
My children!
- They’ll turn my children into
Bin Laden!
- Come when I tell you!
- Let’s go. Come!
- Take her behind the wall!
- Let me go!
- This is your last chance. Trust
me!
Let me go!
They won’t do anything to your
kids.
But they’ll kill you.
- Get up! Get up!
- Let me go!
- You’re not coming?
- She won’t come.
Leave her.
I didn’t want to tell you,
but they’ve killed Shahaab
and will kill you too.
Faezeh?
Faezeh?
The Iranian terrorist was
identified from the hospital
cameras.
I finally got them after 20
days.
His name is Ghodratollah
Khoda-Sefat.
A fake name.
He’s a sharpshooter.
He was captured in the war,
and they cut off his trigger
finger.
He entered Pakistan
with an Afghan passport.
The government
of Afghanistan says it is fake.
Look son.
Look.
Take it.
Watch and learn.
Faezeh didn’t accompany
the Iranian terrorists.
She stayed because she
wants to take revenge.
She doesn’t know anything about
Shahaab’s death.
We’ll all die when she finds
out.
Me, you, Ghamnaz.
- She is very dangerous.
- I know she stayed behind for
her children.
You are naïve
and will pay the price.
She will finally kill you.
I hope you have finally accepted
me.
Obey your Amir’s orders.
This is your obligation.
Are you worried about your
children losing their mother?
A true fighter has to sacrifice
everything,
his wife, children, belongings, everything.
God will provide you with the
best women in heaven.
Faezeh is an infidel.
You have married an infidel.
The enemy will inform on us all.
Don’t doubt this.
Her brother confessed.
I can take revenge on Faezeh,
but I want you to have the
blessing.
You deserve it.
A true fighter should
overcome his emotions.
You have to begin Jihad
on those closest to you.
I don’t want to call you an
outsider.
Today we will have a ceremony
for you.
Stop that!
I don’t want my
second-in-command
to show weakness.
I want to be alone
with Faezeh tonight.
Watch the children for a few
hours.
I’ve bought her a necklace.
Pearls.
For the twins she’s given me.
Let’s see if she’ll forgive me.
Abdol-Hamid I won’t forgive you.
- She is innocent.
- What’re you talking about? Stop
it.
Abdol-Majid has left our
religion.
Don’t listen to him.
You are older, better, wiser.
Don’t be fooled by him.
- He isn’t the Amir of dust, let
alone you and I.
- Let me go.
I want to be alone with
my wife.
She was pregnant, then she gave
birth,
and her 40 days are over now.
Can’t you see she won’t talk to
me?
She’s my wife.
The mother of my children.
She’s my life, my heart.
I went through hell to get her.
Forget about Abdol-Majid.
He can say what he wants.
I will send her to Iran.
I’m not crazy.
I’ll let her go.
Don’t worry.
Why are you so pale?
My lady doesn’t need this stuff.
But tonight that we’re alone,
she can be prettier.
Not so pale.
Pretty and glowing.
Faezeh, I have always done
the right things too late.
But I did emotional,
thoughtless things very early in
life.
See what I’ve bought you.
Do you like it?
Faezeh I hurt you very much.
Please forgive me.
But you know
where you belong, don’t you?
Where is it?
Show me.
Where is Shahaab?
Where is he?
Where is Shahaab?!
- Where is he?!
- It wasn’t my fault.
- Where is he?!
- It wasn’t my fault.
- Where is he?!
- It wasn’t my fault.
- Where is he?!
- I didn’t do anything! I swear!
- Where is he?
- Where is Shahaab?
- Where is he?
- I didn’t do anything!
- Shahaab! Shahaab!
- I swear I didn’t do anything!
- Shahaab! Shahaab!
- I swear I didn’t do anything!
- Shahaab! Shahaab!
- Please stop that!
Please!
Where is my brother? Where is
he?
Two months later Abdol-Malek
expelled
Abdol-Hamid from Jundallah. Abdol-Hamid
was arrested by Pakistani forces
in May 2008,
and handed to Iranian intelligence.
Abdol-Malek Rigi was arrested in
Iran’s air space
as he was flying from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan.
- Did Behrouz send you?
- Yes.
