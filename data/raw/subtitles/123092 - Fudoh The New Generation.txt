No other creature is like a human being...
Even wolves do not prey on each other...
...but humans will eat each other alive.
Hey...
Riki, catch like a man.
It's a little hard, Ryu.
Hey!
Sir, it's a call from our dealer in Kobe.
It's me.
Got anything?
Hell, way more than just anything...
Sounds like Kobe has a deal with Korea...
Mountain.
River.
Hey!
Old man!
Old man!
Sir...
Our dealer was killed by the Yasha gang.
So, they got the jump on us.
That Nohma bastard!
An eye for an eye.
Kobe City
Yasha Gang fifth grand
successor: Daigen Nohma
Excuse me.
Come in.
We have a package from our dealer in Hakata.
Nioh Temple (a.k.a. Dope Temple)
It's bad.
Really bad, indeed.
I have no excuse for what my son Ryu did!
The people there are insisting
on a full scale war against us.
If the Yasha gang comes to Kyushu now...
... we'll be finished, eh?
The Nioh family is finished.
What are you going to do about it, Mr. Fudoh?
I will...
I will take full responsibility.
This feast celebrates the Fudoh Family's raid,
Ryu...
Father, the Yasha made the first move on us.
So, you say there's no way to avoid the war.
Ryu...
Don't die no matter what.
Hey.
Eat.
Thank you for the food.
Fudoh, you said you would be fully
responsible in front of the chairman.
Tell us what you're going to do.
Where is he?
I don't see him here!
Since it's your own son, you
may let him get away, no?
If that's the case, it's going to cost
a lot more than your pinky finger!
My finger?
No, your arm!
It's going to cost your whole arm
to make an apology to the Yasha!
No need for that.
What?
This should settle the conflict between us.
Are you going out, sir?
I'm meeting with the mayor.
I see.
Did I forget something?
The anniversary of Ryu's death is coming soon.
Is that so?
I forgot.
It's the tenth anniversary.
Ten years?
It has been ten years since then, huh?

Hey, kid.
Is it a school holiday today?
It ain't good...
You've got a bright future...
Here.
Let's go.
Ryuji Komoku, one of four executive
council members of the...
... Kyushu Nioh Group, died
on July 13th at 7:42 AM.
Officers...
Doing this is such a waste of tax money!
Shut up!
Sir.
Yes?
We're getting gas, okay?
Okay.
Welcome!
I gotta pee.
Welcome!
Complimentary coffee...
Here you go.
Tastes awful.
Hey.
Hey, what's wrong?
Hey!
Hey, are you all right?
Hey!
What the hell?
Hey!
What's wrong?
Hey!
What is this?
Hey!
I don't know!
What's going on?
Oh, my...
Akira Jikoku, one of four executive
council members of the...
:: Kyushu Nioh Group, died
on July 13th at 10:05 PM.
Bastard, are you going to run away?
Thanks, it was delicious!
What the hell do you mean by that?
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, you think you can get away with this?
Nakasu Commercial High School
You, moron!
How dare you listen to such trash during class!
Fudoh...
Come to the counseling room later.
Yes, sir.
Stand.
Bow.
Mr. Aizome, I hope you get
used to the school quickly.
Who's that guy?
That's your classmate, Riki Fudoh.
Sounds like a wrestler's name for a skinny boy.
He's the best student in
our school, so be friends.
Here's three million yen.
Please take it for now.
I'll pay the rest within a week, no matter what!
I'm sorry!
Ten million is a lot of money for a teacher and...
...I just couldn't get it all at once!
Say, Mr. Arita, it was you who wanted the drugs.
I don't mind if you commit suicide.
What's the fucking matter with this shop?
Shut up, monster punk!
Every massage parlor in Nakasu
knows what happened last night!
What happened?
You bilked paying...
...and sent all the women to the
hospital with your huge eggplant dick!
You want to go, too?
Who the hell is that kid?
Watch your mouth.
That's the young Fudoh
who runs the Nakasu area.
What?
Young?
Yakuza?
She's a babe, isn't she?
So many strippers are porno star drop-outs...
...but she's really talented to do that.
Tenkai Zocho, one of four executive
council members of the...
...Kyushu Nioh Group died
on July 14th at 8:25 PM.
"If you wish to live in idleness
for the rest of your life..."
"Free yourself of your worldly possessions..."
This phrase comes from
classic "Thurezure gusa"...
As you recall, in this book...
They're really good this year.
Hello?
Boss.
Boss.
It's Uncle from Ehime.
What's up?
Is that so?
Who's that?
Can you spare me some purifying water?
Very well.
Go.
Good morning, sir.
Your blood is the purifying water.
Bishamon Tobatsu, one of four
executive council members of the...
...Kyushu Nioh Group died
on July 15th at dawn.
Very bad...
Really bad...
However, it is such a shame that we
can't have a proper funeral for them.
I prefer not to call the gangs from the
mainland for such a reason, either.
Those four knew that better than anybody.
Right, Dad?
I wanted to call for an emergency meeting...
...but the only ones we can
truly trust are the two of you.
It's about time to stop guarding
those old guys like statues.
Yes.
Even if it's just for decoration, those Nioh-god
statues at the shrine are scarier than them.
Whoever killed the four council members
must be thinking the same as me.
History is created.
Everything is in place.
The strong always win.
This is the rule of the world.
Fudoh!
Every time you make a call,
somebody dies in Hakata.
What the hell are you planning?
Akira Aizome...
Born in Osaka on April 1st, 1976.
Sent to reform school for two and
a half years for violent behavior.
First charge was murdering your own parents...
But it was dismissed because of your age...
Wait!
Hey!
Answer my question!
Get out of my way.
I said move!
What a chick!
Sorry.
My period just started.
If you want to know more, follow me.
You want me to play soccer
with these kids here?
The English teacher!
Cool.
Here I go!
It's splattered all over.
It's no fucking joke.
Go!
It's kind of fun actually.
I get the picture now.
You guys got rid of the four council members.
A body becomes stiff unless you
keep changing old blood with new.
The Nioh Group is finished since
it's content to stay in Kyushu.
Sounds boring.
I'm leaving.
Bang!
If you wanted to kill me,
you could have anytime.
Why don't you?
You can see a big tree in front of
you but you don't see a big forest.
Needless to say, you can feel
the wind, but you can't see it.
Soon, the blue wind will blow, and
the big forest will start moving.
I don't know what you're after...
...but it seems like it's not
just about a local gang war.
Aizome, want to see fireworks?
Fireworks?
It's a raid.
A raid?
The Yasha Gang?
To Nioh Temple.
Good evening!
Young Fudoh...
What's with the sword?
It's the anniversary of my brother's death.
I came to put his keepsake at his grave.
Very well, sir.
Who's there?
Oh, it's Riki boy, what's going on so late?
Fudoh's kid.
What's going on?
Dad's balls are mine...
Die!
Now, Kyushu is completely mine.
Mr. Fudoh...
Aren't you in a rush?
I'll be substituting for Mr. Arita
I'll be your new English teacher.
What do you mean?
If you speed things up too
much, you won't get a turn.
Don't go in circles.
Be direct, will you?
Be careful not to get your own neck ripped off.
If you speed things up too much,
you can't see things around you.
Jun Miroku.
Nice to meet you.
Ever since I was born, "get them before
they get me" has been my motto.
So the day you and I will take over this
country is not far away, Mr. Nohma.
You know, my goal isn't just this country.
Ms. Miroku, you got a bad one.
He's a genius.
AV Room
Now, the Nioh Group and the Yasha
gang are completely hand in hand.
What's Nohma's ultimate goal?
He's been to North Korea many times.
His organization is gathering military
data from the Japanese government.
It's not just for himself.
It's for North Korea.
Nohma made a deal with them to
start a war with the Americans.
My old man has just been
brainwashed by Nohma.
He's dancing on Nohma's palm.
I won't let Nohma do whatever he wants!
You're a very enthusiastic teacher.
Your older brother?
Revenge calls for more revenge.
Ms. Miroku.
Ms. Miroku...
What is it you want?
What do you mean?
My brother's blood is running in this sword.
I won't let more new blood be wasted!
Wasn't that a fabulous gift?
Maybe I will join your team after you
take care of what's getting in our way.
Right away.
I'll take care of it right away.
You'd better think carefully
before going into action.
It's not going to be like it
was with your older son.
I'm looking forward to it...
Young Fudoh's severed head.
Aboji.
Thank you.
I need to ask you a favor.
I'm honored if I can be of
any help to you, Father.
Gon.
Actually, it's not the Yasha
who killed Nioh's council.
All I planned was to unite with the Yasha.
But somebody's getting in the way.
Who is that?
My son.
He must be in school now.
You want me to eliminate your own son.?
You want him dead, a blood relative?
In other words, to kill my half-brother...
I'm counting on you.
Eat, eat.
Excuse me, sir...
Sir!
You can't come in here!
You call this kimchee?
We marinate it the Japanese way...
Whoa...
It's too much!
Oh, he passed out!
What a wimp!
Hey, you!
It's quite adolescent, huh?
Adolescent?
Shut the fuck up!
Go away!
I am the gym teacher for this
semester, Akihiro Gondo.
Nice to meet you.
You...
Where is the teacher's office?
On the first floor.
Thank you.
Mr. Fudoh, please report
to the counseling room.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
Aizome's bike got bombed.
He's at our regular doctor.
Mr. Gondo, isn't it?
What are you doing here?
Korean pickles.
Say, Mr. Gondo.
Forget everything you saw or...
...jump from here.
Which do you prefer?
What's so funny?
After Aizome is you, Touko Zenzai.
That's gross, bitch!
This morning, we have some very sad news.
Ms. Touko Zenzai of Class 2-E died last night.
Why did such a popular and good
student like her take her own life?
It is such a shame..
One after another.
More victims.
Right, Boss?
It's just like an ordinary Yakuza gang.
This is for Ms. Zenzai.
A moment of silence.
Don't worry about a thing.
Act normally.
Okay?
I was surprised to know you have such a job.
What about it?
I came to ask you about the
relationship between you and Fudoh.
Who are you?
Before that, I'd like to show you something.
May I use your shower?
Shower?
It appears only when the skin is warmed up.
This is my secret.
Nobody knows my secret.
Ms. Miroku...
Would you like...
...to know my secret?
Surprised?
You're...
Yes, I'm a hermaphrodite.
I'm both man and woman.
I should decide how to live by myself.
Ms. Miroku...
I know I can't be happy.
That's my Mika!
Mika!
Mr. Fudoh...
Mika, don't talk.
G-Go... Gondo...
Gondo...
Fudoh!
Where's Fudoh?
Mr. Aizome...
You're all going to die.
By the way, Ms. Miroku, who the hell are you?
It's late, Mr Gondo.
What's wrong, Mr. Fudoh?
I'm checking up on you.
It's unusual for a student to do that.
It's a great apartment.
For a teacher's low salary, I shouldn't
have such luxurious tastes.
Mr. Gondo...
My old man must have sent you...
Your real name is Won Myonbak.
A former special agent of the Korean Army.
Love child of Iwao Fudoh.
I don't mind if you call me "big brother".
Mr. Gondo...
Do you know the "Moon River"?
Moon River?
Since ancient times, nobody can cross
the Moon River more than once, alive.
The body that will floating in
the Moon River will be yours!
Too bad, I'm going to cross the
Moon River more than once, alive!
This beautiful teacher is the
Kanto Ashura Group's...
...fifth grand successor, Junko Ashura.
You knew.
You came to kill me, so more blood
would not be wasted, right?
Like brother, like brother.
You're just like your brother.
I know that you are the only
woman he loved in his life.
I've started thinking more like you.
I am so sick of the old Yakuza society
that killed your brother just like that.
That's why we started the
fireworks of this festival.
Now, the Fudoh Family will
go west into the mainland.
Will you be our navigator on the mainland?
But before that, I have
something to take care of.
Father...
Riki...
You...
Old man...
The era of a child sacrificing
himself for a parent is over.
Not yet.
It's not over yet.
Old man...
Riki...
Father...
Can you see that the blue wind is
blowing and that the big forest moves?
What are you doing here?
You've got some guts!
Hey, Nohma!
Shoot me if you want.
It's going to make you look ridiculous,
attacking an unarmed guest at a funeral.
What was that?
Stop that!
Stop that.
Treat our guest...
...with the proper respect.
So, this is to celebrate your take-over
as well as being your father's funeral.
Mr. Nohma...
You're next.
The festival...
...has Just begun.
"Free yourself of your worldly possessions..."
