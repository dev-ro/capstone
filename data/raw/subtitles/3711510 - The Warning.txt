A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM
-Hello, Andrea.
-Hello, Jon.
Are you with David?
He's not picking up.
No, I'm waiting outside.
I think he was in a meeting.
What nerve.
If he's not out in five minutes,
drag him out by the hair.
Okay.
And can you get some ice
from the 24-hour store?
Your buddy can't do without
his gin and tonic.
Whatever you say, boss.
Go on, don't be long. Big kiss.
See you soon. Big kiss.
That's it, Jon. Let's go.
Thirty-two minutes late.
Sorry. I'll tell you later. Go.
I need some ice
from the 24-hour store.
And champagne.
No shit. You're going to ask her?
Tonight?
Sure, with you there.
Fuck, no. I'll tell her we're spending
the weekend in Paris.
That's great. Paris.
Yes. I'll propose to her in Paris.
She'll love it.
I'm happy for you. For both of you.
I know.
And you know who's going to be
my best man?
-If she says yes.
-Shit, man. Can you imagine?
Kneeling under the Eiffel Tower like:
"Will you marry me?"
"Well, no.
Fuck off!"
Stop kidding!
I'll go.
-Want anything?
-Don't forget the ice. Thanks.
24-HOUR STORE

David!
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

David...
10 YEARS LATER
A guy was killed in there ten years ago.
There was blood
and bits of brain on the floor.
I heard it was a shooting.
And two guys died.
Look.
He's gonna piss himself.
For me.
Now go inside the store
and get us a porn mag.
Go on, move it!
-Move it!
-Go!
Nico, what are you doing here?
I waited for you at school
for half an hour!
Are you all right?
Sorry, Mom.
Go on, get in.
Where's your bag?
At school, I don't have any homework.
This is the last time you leave
without telling me.
Go on, put on your seat belt.
Okay.
How is he?
In a coma. They're going to do
some brain activity tests on him,
we'll have the results in the morning.
My brother's not going without a fight.
-Can I see him?
-One second.
Did you see who did it?
I saw someone leave,
but not his face. It was so fast.
He ran off?
No, he got in a car.
-Anything else?
-There was another man inside.
He was... I don't know,
from the East or Russian.
He had a tattoo here and he was hurt.
He pointed a gun at me
and left.
We'll get the fucker who did this.
-Let's go.
-Yes.
My love... My darling...
You have to fight. Please.
Don't leave me alone. Please.
Please hold on.
Please hold on.
He can't die.
He's not going to die.
You owe us a mag, asshole!
Hey!
Don't forget it, dickhead!
Mom!
Mom, let's go. Let's go.
-You have to defend yourself.
-They're older than me.
If they insult or hit you,
tell the teacher, or I will.
I'm not a snitch, Mom.
Please don't talk to the school.
Unless you defend yourself,
they'll keep messing with you.
And they'll take your backpack.
I have to get gas.
Go get a shake, I'll be right there.
What are you doing?
Aren't you a bit young
to be stealing porn mags?
How old are you?
I'll be 10 next week.
Please don't tell my mother.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Nico, did you get the shake?
Not yet.
What are you waiting for?
How much is it? Number 7.
That's 30 euros for the gas
and the magazine.
-Thanks.
-Thank you.
Do you come to this store a lot?
No.
It looked like the owner knew you.
What were you talking about?
Did you know a guy
got killed in there ten years ago?
They blew his brains out.
-Who told you that?
-Some kids from school.
Is it true?
The same ones that were picking on you?
I'm sure they made it up to scare you.
It's a positive response.
We're optimistic.
But we have to wait.
-It's too soon to tell.
-Excuse me.
The doctor said that a vein
is blocking the temporal lobe
and that may be why
his brain's not reacting.
Can they save him?
Yes. It's a difficult surgery, but yes,
there's a chance
he could come out of the coma.
That's great news.
-When are they operating on him?
-I don't know.
He's still very weak.
They've given him blood transfusions
and they have to watch his progress.
Excuse me.
Marta.
Listen... did you get my message?
SHOOTING IN 24-HOUR STORE
He's still very weak.
Don't tell Mom and Dad yet, okay?
No, don't worry. I'll keep you posted.
TERRORIST ATTACK BY ETA
IN SAME PLACE 32 YEARS AGO
Bye.
Jon.
Jon.
Thirty-two years ago
there was an attack in the same place.
In the 24-hour store?
Go home and get some rest,
you must be exhausted.
No, I'm fine.
Shall we get some dinner or...?
No, I want to spend some time
with David's mother.
Relax. If anything happens
I'll tell you, okay?
-Okay.
-All right.
Thanks.
-Bye.
-Bye.
SAVING A LIFE
LISANDRO LÓPEZ, 10
Ten, 32...
Ten, 32...
GAS STATION
32 YEARS AGO
...A 32-YEAR-OLD MAN
WITH TWO GUNSHOT WOUNDS...
Ten, 32...
Nico, your snack.
Eat up and then finish your homework.
Nico, your snack.
What's wrong, Nico?
Are you all right?
Bastards.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
It's just a sick joke.
Get up, you've had an accident.
Sorry, Mom.
I didn't notice.
Never mind. It's fine.
Go to the bathroom.
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
DON'T GO TO THE 24-HOUR PLACE
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL DIE.
It was in his bag, inside that envelope.
They're making his life impossible.
They pick on him, take his things,
hit him. No one does anything.
I saw it myself the other day.
And now this.
Lucía, we do all we can
to avoid these situations.
I'll find out who these boys are
and I'll talk to them.
It's not about talking.
I won't allow that they do this to my son.
I want them to be punished, expelled.
I understand, but this is a state school.
We can't do anything
without being totally sure.
First, I'd have to talk to Nico.
He won't tell you anything.
He keeps it to himself,
and he's having a rough time.
They're scaring him with the story
of the man killed in the gas station.
And now this letter?
They're harassing him.
Those are harsh words.
Harsh words?
"Whatever happens,
don't go to the 24-hour store
on your birthday, April 12, 2018.
If you do, you'll die."
When Nico read this letter,
he wet himself.
That's never happened to him.
Let's do this. Leave me the note, please.
If they bother Nico again,
he needs to report it.
To the teacher, the head teacher or me.
Otherwise, we can't help him.
Take a good look.
There.
The bullet came from that fucker's gun.
-Did you find out anything else?
-No.
But we'll catch him.
It's a matter of time.
How are the others?
The store guy and the boy.
The owner's all right.
He got a good scare, but...
I'm worried about the boy, he's only 10.
Ten? Yes, why?
Did you know that in 1976
there was an attack there?
And there was a boy, too.
Ten years old.
That's strange. Isn't it?
Pure chance.
Fucking bugs.
What's wrong?
My mom went to talk
to the principal yesterday
and I'm sure I'll get into trouble
with Luis and his friends.
Look.
Let's go.
Whose idea was it?
We didn't do anything.
Sure, the note wrote itself
and magically got into Nico's bag.
Maybe.
Fine. We'll do a handwriting test.
And if the writing on this note
matches any of you,
I'll open a harassment protocol.
And if I find out
you've laid a hand on Nico,
I'll expel the three of you.
Is that clear?
What does the note say?
That if I go to the 24-hour store
on my birthday, I'll die.
-Jon?
-Jon Zárate.
-How are you?
-Nice to meet you.
-Come in.
-Yes.
I made some copies.
Thank you.
See? In 1976 there was no store,
just the pumps and an office.
The official car was here, filling up.
The general was in the back,
reading the paper.
I was with the general's escort
cleaning the windshield.
A beautiful black Dodge.
Then I heard the sound
of a motorbike approaching.
With two men.
Suddenly, the passenger
pulled out a machine-gun.
It all happened so fast.
The escort jumped on me
and covered me with his body.
Meanwhile, the terrorist shot at the car.
When the magazine was empty...
he yelled, "Long live ETA,"
got on the bike and they left.
I tried to move, but I couldn't.
The escort's body was on top of me.
He was dead.
The general was shot several times,
but he was luckier and survived.
I went to the funeral.
I'll never forget it.
The escort's mother came over...
and made me promise
to make the most of my life
so that her son's death
was not in vain.
I'm not a genius or a scientist
or anything, but...
what I make from this business
allows me
to finance some soup kitchens
and some summer camps
for underprivileged kids.
I think I kept my promise.
Why do you want to know all this?
The person who was shot
is my best friend.
I'm sorry.
Don't you think it's strange?
What?
That there were two shootings
in the same place.
In both, five people were present.
In both, a 10-year-old boy.
Yes, it's strange.
PASSIONATE CRIME DURING THE SALE
Because in 1955,
there was a murder there.
And it happened on April 12.
SEE YOU IN THE LOCKER ROOM
IN THE GYM, IT'S IMPORTANT
Sara?
You thought you'd scored, huh?
You made up that shit to fuck us over.
I didn't make up anything.
-You wrote it yourself!
-I didn't!
We could get expelled
because of you, dickhead!
Take off your clothes.
Take off your clothes
or I'll beat your fucking head in!
Strip!
Smile. Listen to me.
Fuck us over again,
and we'll post this photo online.
Got it?
Do you want to see the picture?
How come you have a picture?
Nico, what's up?
He looks terrible.
I've got a picture, guys.
Let's see it. Why do you have it?
JON ZÁRATE,
WINNER OF THE MATH OLYMPICS
Hello, this is Jon Zárate.
Leave a message. Thanks.
Mr. Zárate, this is Social Services.
The renewal of your temporary leave
is up for revision.
We need to do a complete check-up
to reauthorize it.
Hello?
Yes, I'm coming down.
LOOK FOR A PATTERN
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
How old do you think the Russian is
from the 24-hour store?
Forty... 42.
Forty or 42?
I don't know, 42.
Forty.
How long have they been now?
David was taking me
to Paris this weekend.
He left the computer on
and I saw the tickets.
He's not good at keeping secrets.
Right.
He told you everything, huh?
-Right after I got out of the hospital.
-Jon, those were six tough months.
These things happen.
I was in for a long time,
you two spent a lot of time together.
-They've finished.
-And?
The surgeon says it went well.
We have to wait
and see how he progresses.
-Let's grab something to eat.
-Yes.
We've caught the man who did it.
Aren't you happy?
Yes, of course.
Sure, but if he's a minor
and gets away with it...
No, he's not a minor. That's for sure.
He's around 20.
Twenty-one, he's 21.
What I'm going to tell you
may sound strange, but listen, okay?
I've been looking into some things.
Look,
the night David was shot,
there were five people:
the owner, who is 53,
a 10-year-old boy,
David, who is 32, the Russian, 42,
and since we don't know
the assailant's age, a question mark.
Right, on April 12, 1976,
this same place was attacked.
There were also five people present:
a general, 53, his escort, 21,
a 10-year-old boy,
a terrorist, 42,
and the other terrorist was 32 exactly.
Do you see the sequence?
-That's insane.
-If you think that is, check this out.
In 1955, in the same place,
there was another shooting.
-Also on April 12.
-At the gas station?
But in 1955, it was an inn.
It was a crime of passion.
Apparently, the owner had a lover,
and when she wanted to break up with him,
he went crazy
and showed up with a shotgun.
At the time, the man was exactly 53,
the woman, 42.
A nephew who worked at the inn, 21.
A customer having a glass
of wine there, 32.
Who else was there?
The woman's son, who was, of course, 10
That's why I say that David's killer
has to be exactly 21,
because the numerical sequence is perfect.
Amazing! Jon, people don't die because of math.
-This makes no sense.
-Yes, it does, Andrea. Here's the proof,
numbers don't lie. Three times,
and every time a person dies. It's math!
David's not dead, damn it!
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
It's true.
It was a stupid idea.
Jon,
David was shot on April 2, not 12.
That's true.
Where'd you get that date from?
You're saying I'm making it up?
I'm not saying anything. You tell me.
April 12 is your birthday.
And?
-Have you stopped taking your meds?
-I can't take them.
They make my head fuzzy
and I need to be lucid.
But you can't stop taking your pills.
Does your doctor know?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Twenty-one-fifty, please.
I don't give a fuck about your family.
You're not going to any birthday!
You know I was excited about it.
-You're staying at home.
-Why?
You're going home
to look after your kids!
Please, not here.
Please.
You're not going anywhere
with your slutty cousin.
Relax. I'll take care of it.
-Sir, you have to leave the store.
-Don't touch me, fat-ass!
-Sit down.
-No, thanks.
We've spoken to the three boys
we think might've written the note.
-They deny it all.
-What else would they say?
We did a handwriting test on them
and the writing on the note
doesn't match any of them.
Look, see it for yourself.
HANDWRITING EXPERT REPORT
But someone had to write it, right?
According to the test,
it's an adult's handwriting.
Lucía, I don't want to pry,
but I think it's my duty to tell you.
Maybe this matter is related
to your family situation.
I don't understand.
We know that your ex-husband
has a restraining order.
We've dealt with this kind of thing before
and maybe Nico's father is involved.
This is too much.
Lucía, listen, please.
The note mentions his birthday.
Maybe he wants to be with him.
-I'm reporting this to the police.
-Lucía, please.
I'm sorry if I offended you,
but we can't rule out the possibility.
All you care about is your fucking record
and this fucking school.
I care about my students.
Then keep them away from him,
fucking do something!
They won't touch your son again.
I assure you.
You said that last time
and nothing's changed.
--and the paper napkins.
There you go. Here's your change.
-Thanks.
-Bye.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
I was here the other day with my son.
We bought a magazine.
Someone slipped an envelope inside
with a threat,
that if he comes here
on April 12, he'll die.
Maybe it's not a threat.
Maybe it's a warning.
This is ridiculous. Did you do it?
Look, there was a shooting here
years ago on April 12th.
Don't let your son come here
on that day... end of story.
EMPLOYEE, 32
KILLER, 53
Hello, this is Jon Zárate.
Leave a message.
Thanks.
Mr. Zárate,
Dr. Ortiz insists
that you contact us immediately.
The therapy is vital for controlling
the progress of the medication.
Please, call us.
BLOODY INCIDENT AT HEAD OFFICE
OF CRÉDITO AGRÍCOLA BANK
Don't blink, please.
The left one.
Good.
Are you okay?
Yes. I haven't slept much lately.
You have eyestrain.
I'll prescribe some drops.
I didn't come here about my eyes.
Why, then?
I wanted to know if you were
the son of Mercedes Vizcay,
the woman who died
at the Los Molinos inn.
I'm sorry, but I have patients waiting.
You were 10 when it happened,
weren't you?
Are you a journalist? No, I'm not a journalist.
In that same spot, a few days ago,
a friend of mine was shot.
I read about it in the papers.
-I'm really sorry.
-Thanks a lot.
Also, in that place,
there was an attack in 1976.
And another murder in 1913,
I don't know if you knew that.
-What do you want from me?
-Whatever, any information.
I couldn't find out much
about what happened in 1913.
That place is cursed.
It was a massacre.
Do you know what happened?
Listen to me, leave it alone.
Forget that place.
I need to know.
Please, I need this.
Ask for Verónica,
maybe she can give you more details.
Hi, this is Verónica.
I can't come to the phone.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
Hello, this is Verónica.
I can't come...
Hey! You idiot!
Asshole!
Can I help you?
Excuse me, are you looking for something?
I know you.
You were here the day of the shooting.
What do you know about this place
before it was yours?
Nothing, it was a gas station.
I bought it from a guy.
That's a lie.
Look, if you're not buying anything,
you'd better go.
I don't want any trouble.
Leave or I'll call the police.
Other species avoid these difficulties
developing a totally different behavior.
A couple is working here.
Leave me alone. What's wrong?
You know very well.
I had nothing to do with it.
How can you even think that?
You're not the only one
who got the warning.
...into a large chamber
which is more than a half-meter deep.
Now, the priority is to stock up
enough food, and to do it,
they don't have to go outside...
Martín Vallet received it, too.
How do you know?
Her mother told mine.
The silence of the subsoil is broken...
He got a note?
No, the day Martín was born,
a man showed up
at the hospital and warned them.
What did he say to them?
That if he went to the 24-hour store
the day he turned ten, he'd die.
That's why they won't let him
leave the house that day.
-Nothing's going to happen.
-How do you know?
It'll be a wonderful day.
You can't be sure of that.
Honey, it's your birthday.
We'll go to the movies and get a burger.
I don't want to go
to the 24-hour store.
Nico, we'll go there together
-and I'll buy you a present, okay?
-Are you crazy?
I'm not going there on my birthday.
You can't live in fear, honey.
It's the worst.
I don't care, I'm not going there!
-You'll go.
-You can't make me.
I'm not, I'm going with you.
I'll be there with you.
My dad wouldn't do this.
-Any good father would do it.
-That's a lie.
Another boy from school got the warning.
And his parents won't let him
leave the house that day.
OUR LADY OF PILAR
CARE HOME FOR THE ELDERLY
Jon, David's getting worse.
The doctors fear the worst.
He's not responding to the treatment.
Call me, please.
She's deaf in her right ear.
Sometimes she confuses places and people.
Otherwise, she's fine.
There she is.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for seeing me.
Do we know each other?
No. I'm here on behalf of
your granddaughter, Verónica.
She spoke very highly of you.
She said you're incredible...
and have a great memory.
She's a historian,
she loves old things like me.
But... why did she send you
to this stopping place for mummies?
She told me that you could tell me
what happened at the branch
of Crédito Agrícola Bank.
That was a long time ago.
I was barely two years old.
But you heard about what your father,
Ezequiel González, did?
What happened?
What was your father like?
My father was a desperate man.
He'd spent a long time in the African war.
He suffered...
from all kinds of diseases there.
When he came back...
he infected me with one of those...
African viruses.
I was dying.
And my father had no money
for the treatment,
so he went to that bank
and begged the manager...
to give him a loan.
But since we were poor
and had no property...
the manager refused.
My father was so desperate
watching his daughter die...
that he decided to rob that bank.
But something went wrong.
It all went wrong.
The bank manager had a gun
and tried to stop the robbery.
The other people started screaming...
and he acted as if he was in the war.
He went crazy...
and started shooting.
He killed four people.
Then he committed suicide.
He committed suicide?
Who could live with the death
of four innocent people on his conscience?
I won't bother you anymore.
Thank you for everything.
Are you sure...
we don't know each other?
No.
Thank you.
April 12, 1913.
April 12, 1955.
April 12, 1976.
Always April 12.
APRIL 2, 2008
No, not always.
Not always.
No, but he's still alive.
He's alive physically,
but the latest tests indicate
that he's in phase four,
an advanced phase.
There's no hope of recovery.
I'm very sorry.
Is there nothing that can be done?
Unfortunately, no.
I think the most humane thing
would be to turn off life support
-and let him go in peace.
-But...
some people have woken up.
There have been cases.
-The probability is one in a million.
-That means there's hope.
David could be that one in a million.
Let's go.
It's over.
No. We can't let him die,
please.
Hello, this is Jon Zárate.
Leave a message.
Thanks.
Jon, they want to unplug him.
I need you to help me. Come here or...
call me back or something.
BOY
10 YEARS OLD
Go!
Go!
The one with the whistle out.
The ref's a slacker.
-Excuse me.
-Hello.
-Martín Vallet's father?
-Yes.
I'm Lucía, the mother
of Nicolás, a classmate.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
-What, did they fight?
-No. It's not that.
Is Martín not going to class on Tuesday?
Yes. Why?
My son received a note, a sort of warning
or threat...
-And you think it was Martín?
-No.
But he told me that you also got one
in the hospital,
when your wife was giving birth.
I don't know what you're saying.
Martín's not going on Tuesday
because he's seeing the doctor.
Of course.
-Sorry.
-It's okay.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
What did he say?
He's not going to class, is he?
Because he has to see the doctor.
Yeah, right.
Stop it! Okay?
I don't want to hear
another word about this.
Got it?
Fasten your seat belt.
-I've been calling you.
-I lost my cell phone.
Sorry, it's a disaster here. How's David?
They're unplugging him tomorrow.
Pablo and his mother have decided it.
Jon, I need you to talk to them.
-Tell them he's still alive.
-They're unplugging him tomorrow?
Tomorrow is 12.
Now it makes sense.
What does?
It's always on the 12,
do you understand?
April 12, Ezequiel killed four people,
then committed suicide.
Exactly 42 years later,
a woman aged 42 dies.
Twenty-one years later,
a man, aged 21, dies. And 32 years later,
a man, aged 32, will die.
You see?
The pattern has repeated four times.
Every time one dies, the next one is born.
It only needs to repeat once more
for the circle to close.
So, in ten years,
a 10-year-old boy will die.
Do you hear yourself?
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.
You're saying that these
are all the same people,
that every time one dies,
the next one is born,
that this Ezequiel, or whatever,
reincarnates again and again.
It's a numerical sequence.
You're saying that David
and this killer are the same person!
Andrea, are you listening to me or not?
David is going to die.
When he does, a boy will be born.
In ten years, that boy will be shot.
But now that we know it, we can stop it. I know you feel guilty
about what happened.
It had to happen.
David and I had to be there that night.
You went there because I asked you to!
David had to go there
for the circle to close.
No, you had to go
into that fucking 24-hour store!
I asked you to get the ice!
Don't you see that you're the one
who should be dying?
Maybe, but I'm the one
here talking to you.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Nico
Happy birthday to you
Make a wish.
Great!
Happy birthday, honey.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
You're welcome, sweetie.
Go on, get changed, or you'll be late.
Jon, they're going
to unplug him this afternoon
and I'd like you to be here with me.
Happy birthday.
Big kiss.
APPROVAL FORM FOR
CEASING LIFE SUPPORT TREATMENT
Your mother's going to make you go?
David was going to ask you
to marry him in Paris.
I kept it in case he recovered.
Thank you.
I do.
I couldn't save you in this life...
but I will in the next.
-The maternity ward?
-Behind that door.
MATERNITY
The mother is very happy.
Hey, you're not allowed in here, okay?
Listen to me. It's very important,
or your son will die.
Listen to me, whatever happens,
don't let your son
go to the 24-hour store
on April 12, 2018.
-What are you saying?
-Twenty-four-hour store, April 12, 2018.
-Let go of me.
-Fontana street, 24-hour store.
-Let go of me!
-I just want to help!
-Let go of me or his son will die!
-Get out of here!
I just wanted to help! Please!
I just wanted to help!
Hey!
Let go!
You have to listen to me!
Please!
How are you, honey?
Go to the car.
He's not in school.
We've looked everywhere.
He couldn't have gone
without being seen.
Could he have gone home alone?
No, it's his birthday.
He knew I was picking him up,
I told him to wait.
Take it easy, we'll find him, okay?
We'll search the school, call his friends
and do whatever it takes to find him.
-Keep calm.
-Thanks.
Excuse me.
-Hello, good afternoon.
-Hi.
A boy has disappeared.
What's wrong with you?
Unless you tell me, I can't help you.
Have you taken any drug or medication?
I need my pills.
Good, what pills do you take?
In my pocket.
I just wanted to warn them,
their child is in danger.
These are pills for schizophrenia.
You have to believe me. April 12, 2018.
It's going to happen again.
I'll give you an injection.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah.
Poor woman's scared to death.
I'm sure Nico's fine.
Let's go, you'll be late for Music.
What were you thinking, Sara?
Do you know how scared I was?
And the embarrassment?
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
It was my idea.
I'm so sorry. Let's go.
He's still alive? Yes.
He doesn't want to go.
ANDREA CALLING
Mom, please...
-Javi, I have to pee.
-Okay, hurry up.
Get out.
I'm not going in.
Get out right now! I'm sick of this!
Listen to me, son,
I was once like you.
I thought if I hid my head
and looked away, it'd all go away.
But it never goes away.
It got worse.
The fear never left me,
not even when I was alone.
Until one day, I decided
to put an end to it
and face the situation.
Then it was all over.
Do you see
why you have to go in there now?
Look. Here.
Get a shake and the latest issue
of that magazine you like, okay?
When you come out, I promise
we'll never mention this again.
Okay, honey?
Go on.
-Andrea, I can't talk right now.
-Jon, no, wait.
David is one in a million.
What?
He's alive. He's very weak,
but he's alive.
It's like he resurrected, it's a miracle.
Do you hear me? You have to come.
Then you were right.
What?
I was the one who had to die.
No. No one's going to die.
I have to go, Andrea.
Jon, no, wait a moment.
I love you very much.
