I think I'm in a state of shock.
I know the tour's over,
but it's--
Last week in Spain, I really felt like
I was gonna have a nervous breakdown.
I couldn't take the crowds,
do the shows. It was too hot.
Everything was getting to me.
And I thought...
I think I'm getting ready for
the depression for when the tour's over.
But I really didn't feel emotional
last night.
I know everybody else did...
but I didn't feel emotional because
it was like it already ended for me.
It's like when you know
someone's dying...
you have to make your peace
before they die.
I've done this with
close friends of mine.
I make my peace with it
before it happens...
so I don't get really hurt.
And then when it happens
it's like...
I don't feel anything.
But I know I'll feel
something later.
I just don't know
when that's gonna be.
I guess it's a protection device.
I hope I'm in a safe place
when it happens.
What's wrong with me?
I'm freaking out.
I have 'Japanitis.'
Let's walk.
Papa don't preach
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Keith, you motherfucker!
Hello.
The level up here
is not that loud...
and there's no reason
for all this feedback.
If we can't get it to sound better
than this, then I'm not doing a show.
Some someone who knows about sound
better come up here and explain it.
- I'm waiting.
- She's getting pissed.
Why can Donna and Niki
not hear themselves?
Where's John Draper?
She sees me and the smile is gone.
- It's because it's raining, Freddy!
- I know.
You think it's funny.
I don't think it's funny.
Get out. I'm having a business talk.
Good-bye.
Who does she think she is, my mama?
Snatching my head.
I only look white.
She's really Mabel. Remember
What's Happening? That's her.
I was born a poor black child.
No rhythm.
Look at her hair.
Fuckin' pickaninny lookin' shit.
I don't wanna do no makeup
on Madonna, master.
I got rhythm.
Do it the way it looks smooth.
Do you like it over your head?
No. The great thing is your hidden
and then you pop out.
That's why I asked you if I'm gonna
do it over your head or not?
I don't think so.
Take a poll. Ask everybody.
- Take a pole?
- Yeah, and ram it up your ass.
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding, Ollie.
No, you said it.
Every goddamn day, you throw
this little fag stuff on me.
- Don't you know what a poll is?
- Where is a pole? That's a pole.
A poll is when you go around
and take--
Did you say poll?
You're forgiven, Ollie. Everything you
don't know you're forgiven for.
Now let mama get her makeup done.
Oh, God. I love having children
to watch over.
You're not filming me getting an
adjustment. I won't be able to relax.
I'm serious.
Alec, no. No way.
We talked about this in L.A.
About me getting an adjustment.
Just tune it out.
Julie, shut up
and don't tell me to tune it out.
It's cold like
a New York winter day.
It's snowing weather,
that's what it's like.
All of you put black tights on.
Put the bowed costume on.
Put your jacket on, and that's
your costume for the night.
This is so wild.
I'm panicking right now.
Belgium stress.
Five minutes, everybody.
Show time.
Good evening.
I don't know about you,
but I'm freezing my ass off.
But we're gonna do
a good show for you anyway.
For some strange reason...
I failed to realize the first leg of the
tour was during Japan's rainy season.
So, for three straight weeks
we performed the show in a blizzard.
But the dancers are so excited to be
performing for an audience...
the world could blow up
and they wouldn't care.
I, on the other hand, was not
in the mood for Eskimos on ice.
The only thing that kept me
from slashing my wrists...
was the thought of coming back
to America...
and doing the show
the way it was meant to be.
All right, America!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
and it goes like this.
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know you got to
Make him express how he feels
And, baby, then you know
your love is real
You don't need diamond rings
Or 18-karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen
on a throne
Make him love you
till you can't come down
Long stem roses
are the way to your heart
But he needs
to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens
when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right
then move on
Second best is never enough
You'd do much better, baby
on your own
Express yourself
You've got to make him
express himself
So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Baby, ready or not
And when you're gone
he might regret it
Think about the love
he once had
You've got to carry on
but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
so please
Express yourself
So you can respect yourself
By the time we left Japan,
I was getting attached to the dancers...
and I started feeling like
a mother to them.
Gabriel, since you never give me
attitude, you get the oldest one.
Thank you.
When we got to America,
I got to meet the mothers...
of all the children
I temporarily claimed as my own.
And the parents were usually
as colorful as their kids.
It's Mama Make-up.
- Is that it?
- Don't we look alike?
Happy Mother's Day.
Carlton's mom is in the hallway.
I just heard her.
- There she is.
- Hi.
I want one with her. I must.
She is so tiny and cute.
Ooh, baby
do you know what that's worth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Do I have to listen to this?
That's why I want my radio on.
Those girls annoy me.
It's Donna imitating
Belinda Carlisle.
Niki's mommy is singing.
I know. I know.
That's the one.
You know it's a bad sign...
when they want you to go on
a half an hour early.
Everything's fine.
But we're in a conservative town.
And that is another reason
to not wanna live in Chicago.
Beside for the fact
that Oprah Winfrey lives here.
Do you want a T-shirt?
I think I have unconsciously...
chosen people that are
emotionally crippled in some way.
Or who need mothering in some way.
Because...
I think it comes natural to me.
It fulfills a need in me
to be mothered.
Wait a second. You guys.
Does Jose love me
more than I love him?
- It's not possible.
- Yes.
You know what it is?
After rehearsal in our hotel room...
and guess what this child pumped?
Get up off the floor.
Don't ever leave me.
The innocence of the dancers
move me.
They're not jaded in the least.
They haven't been anywhere.
This was the opportunity
of their lives.
And I know that they've suffered
a great deal in their lives...
whether with their families
or just being poor.
And I wanted to give them
the thrill of their lives.
I wanted to impress them.
I wanted to love them.
I'd like to leave a message.
Someone is coming. My father
is coming from New Orleans...
and he's gonna be here
in 20 minutes.
So when he comes,
could you please let him--
I haven't seen him in five years. This
is not important to you. I don't care.
Let him park in the front, please.
No valet. Just let him park.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
Now that I think about it,
I don't want to meet him.
I'm just joking.
I'm looking for
a black Cherokee Jeep.
Wait, hold up.
There's a Jeep leaving.
Bye, Daddy.
Hello.
Thank you.
He's on his way up.
Oh, my God.
How you doing?
When I saw him, I was disappointed
because we didn't look alike.
Not anymore.
When I saw him, it was like,
'This was my brother Lance.'
- When is your birthday?
- You acted just like Lance.
My God, Daddy, if you saw Lance,
you would trip. He acts just like you.
- Really?
- This is a trip.
I'm disappointed.
You can't meet Madonna now.
Ollie, are you okay?
What's wrong, baby?
Wait a minute.
How's your dad?
I believe you.
Please tell me--
- How was it?
- Yeah.
- Were you nervous?
- Oh, no.
- Is he coming to the show?
- Yeah.
Will you bring him backstage?
- After what?
- The show.
Bring him back to my room.
Now, the reason why I haven't
seen him in five years...
and talked to him much
is because he told me...
'Oliver, you're not gonna make it.
I wish you'd stop dancing.'
When he got to Houston,
we had a talk about this.
Then he asked me to forgive him...
which I never heard from him before.
And I forgave him.
I guess he felt happy.
Oh, Father
If you never wanted
to live that way
If you never wanted
to hurt me
Why am I running away
Maybe someday
When I look back
I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
And somebody hurt you too
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good
About myself
- Hello?
- Dad?
- Yes!
- Hi, it's me.
- Hi. How are you?
- Listen.
I realize I haven't talked to you
in a while and I hope all is good.
But I have no idea what night
you guys are coming to the show.
And all that stuff.
So, what's going on?
Your nights were changed.
Who wants to come? And when?
Whatever--
I'd love it if you'd come
to both shows.
It's pretty racy. I don't know
if you could take it two nights.
You had to get racy on me?
Dad, I'm not getting racy.
I've been racy.
- Can't you tone it down a bit?
- For you?
That would be compromising
my artistic integrity.
Of course. Do you undress
in this performance?
No! Of course I don't.
Whatever you can get tickets for.
Dad, I can get you tickets
any night you wanna come.
- That would be great.
- How many tickets do you want?
But you gotta tell me now
and who they're for.
- Martin and a friend.
- How's Marty doing?
- We took him to--
- Did he go to the rehab center?
He's there.
He's getting out on the 25.
- The 25?
- The reason I called...
is he wanted to know
if he could do this?
Do what?
- He wants to have a party.
- Dad, I'll tell you something.
This is really grueling show
and tour.
It's not like when I played stadiums
where I do one show then have days off.
These are back-to-back.
I don't like to go out and party
because I lose my voice.
Halfway through 'Get lnto The Groove,'
the monitors went off on stage.
I cannot hear myself! And he's
standing there like he doesn't know.
I don't think I really anticipated
how draining the show was gonna be.
My brother Christopher warned me
I was gonna regret it.
But by the time I realized
he was right it was too late.
Definitely, one of
the all-time worst.
It wasn't just the physical aspect.
There were so many technical things.
So many little things that could
fuck up and, boy, did they.
Never want to turn your back
The monitors have
never done it before.
Something going on in the building
we didn't have at sound check.
I wanna check everywhere to make sure
this doesn't happen again...
'cause it happened in
'Where's the Party .'
You don't understand
there's no way of checking things--
How come it's not happening
to Niki and Donna?
I have no answer because there's
something close to your frequency--
If you don't find an answer--
I'm singing a cappella
and my headset goes out...
and everybody thinks the show
is over with.
How come it didn't happen
to the girls?
We're all on separate frequencies.
Put me on their fucking frequency.
And you know.
Motherfuck!
Ouch!
Somebody stuck some big fat man
up in the front to give me dirty looks.
I swear to God.
And don't hide back there, Warren.
Get over here.
- Freddy?
- Yes, ma'am?
- You lied.
- What did I lie about?
There was only industry people
in the first two rows.
- I didn't like that.
- You said there wasn't gonna be any.
- I don't how they got there.
- They totally bummed me out.
They sat there with their arms folded,
dirty looks on their faces.
I swear to God. Do something else.
Do my eyebrows.
It was so distracting
and so depressing to me...
to have two rows of people looking like
they weren't there to have fun.
- What's the point?
- Everyone in the pit was dancing.
Freddy, fuck you! There was not.
There were three rows of assholes
and then a space.
I tried to change it, and
I'm trying to change it for tomorrow.
I want it changed.
And John Draper.
- Hi.
- Please give Keith a new asshole...
because he's in charge
of my show, the sound of it.
- Are you talking about the very end?
- It wasn't the very end.
It was in 'Causing a Commotion'
and 'Open Your Heart'...
and 'Keep It Together'
and 'Where's The Party' and 'Vogue'...
my sound kept coming out
on my headset.
- Kept cutting out?
- Don't tell me you didn't know.
- In 'Keep It Together.'
- No. Yeah.
- You were particularly awesome.
- I thought it was killer.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you.
- Awesome.
- People could see it.
- See how good I am when I'm pissed off?
- If that's what it takes.
- No, please, Freddy.
I thought you were in the greatest mood
because you were really putting out.
- The crowd was--
- The crowd was tough.
It was a tough crowd on the sides
because it's L.A.
Look, everyone looked like a goddamn
William Morris agent in the first rows.
Okay, that's it, Freddy.
You stink.
You pussy, man.
Get over here.
What is with you?
Can you believe
I have to do this every night?
Are you gonna be
nicer to me now, Warren?
What?
Where are you going?
Bring some people back because
I have to go home and go to sleep.
Liz, you look
really well rested... not.
I'm trying to turn Warren
into a vegetarian.
I told him I wouldn't have his baby
unless he was a vegetarian.
Not!
- The lights are good here. Don't worry.
- It's good if you lie down.
- That's AI Pacino.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- That's Mandy Patinkin.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.
Los Angeles was hard that way.
I've found it weird for celebrities
to assume a friendship with you...
because you're a celebrity.
It can get kind of awkward.
Warren thanks you all for coming.
Hi.
- You were great.
- Thank you.
Thanks for having us.
It was really generous.
- Thanks for coming.
- We thought it was neat.
- 'Neat?'
- Really neat.
No one's ever described it as that.
Have fun. We won't be making
that other deal.
- Not neat enough for you.
- Not quite.
We've gotta get the kids.
And give them this.
- Thanks.
- God bless. Thanks.
Neat? Anybody who says my show
is 'neat' has to go.
He loves me.
He loves me not.
He just wants to fuck me.
He really cares about me.
- Uh-oh.
- What?
I ended on a 'He loves me not.'
Does this little one count?
- Not if you don't want it to.
- There's two there.
- There are not two.
- Make it not count.
It's one. He loves me all right.
Warren told me Edie Sedgewick
wanted to meet him.
He said, 'Okay,'
'cause he was curious...
as any red-blooded American male
would have been.
She came over, and he said she had
a completely see-through raincoat on...
and nothing on underneath it.
Isn't that funny?
He didn't fuck her.
Isn't that unusual?
- Do you really like them?
- What do you think People will say?
I remember when I told Warren
to bring me a present. He did.
He brought me this really cool
shirt from Dolce and Grebano.
See? I get what I want.
May I speak to Warren Beatty please?
He doesn't even have
a fake name.
Warren, you're supposed to be here.
It's 5:30.
If you don't get over here now,
I'm leaving without you.
I did too.
I never said that.
What an asshole!
Ow.
I had a dream last night...
that Gorbachev came to my show.
My first reaction was...
that Warren was gonna be so jealous
I got to meet him first.
Anyway, it was a good dream.
The police are here.
You can't do the masturbation scene
tonight or you'll be arrested.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, good, let's see what happens.
- They will do it.
- What, jump on stage?
- They'll wait till after the show.
- They'll arrest you after.
- Are you guys serious?
- Totally serious.
Clay is down there with Freddy.
- So what's considered masturbation?
- Sticking your hand on your crotch.
But then another one of our options
is to cancel the show.
- If you choose that, we won't play.
- It's your choice.
We're asking for that, and it's
your choice. It's in your hands.
- We'll have to pay a fine?
- We'll have to cancel the show.
They'll probably take you
to the station.
Write you a ticket. You'll pay for it.
You'd be in every paper.
Yeah! I'm not changing
my fucking show.
I think I need some legal advice
from a Canadian attorney...
before I make a decision.
- You're lying.
- I am not lying.
I swear to God. The police and a
representative from the D.A.'s office.
Two plain clothes policemen
saw the show.
- Really?
- Yesterday.
- And they said--
- Immoral live performance.
You shouldn't have told me.
It might prepare you for this
with the police standing there.
Did you guys hear?
- What?
- That the police are here.
-Why?
-If I touch my crotch, I'll be arrested.
Are you serious?
They arrested Bobby Brown
for fucking on stage.
- That's called jealousy.
- I hope he's in jail when I get there.
My question is
does it help legally--
Strictly as a legal question,
if we go on stage...
and someone says, 'This show
may contain graphic material--'
Doesn't work. Not here.
We are going to jail.
I'm so excited.
Dear Lord...
this is our last night
in Toronto...
the fascist state of Toronto.
All my babies are feeling fragile,
and I want you all to know...
I love you all and I appreciate
everything you're doing for me...
and I'm here if you need me.
I want you to go out there tonight
and give everything you have.
Have a great show. Remember,
in the United States of America...
there is freedom of speech.
And let's kick ass.
Are we gonna go to jail or what?
I ain't changing my show.
I'll give you the options.
They just told me that
there's been complaints...
that there are simulated orgasms,
blah, blah, blah.
It's against their rules
and regulations.
I am not changing my show.
I know you're not, but can you wait five
minutes for me to straighten it out?
- What's to straighten out?
- Hopefully we can change their mind.
All you have to do is tell them
I'm not changing my show.
I am an artist and this is how I express
myself. What do you have to tell them?
We shall overcome
She has told me that this is
artistic freedom. This is her show.
It's gone in several countries
in major cities across the world.
In Canada, if you choose
to do that...
I'm sure it will be
an international scandal.
God, everything's gonna have
a whole new meaning in the show.
Like when I say 'God,' I'll be praying
that I don't get arrested.
Where else am I nasty?
Everywhere.
We're gonna realize tonight
how many places we do this.
Say, 'Toronto, you believe in freedom?
I got something to say about it.'
- Chris, don't let them take me.
- They won't.
Celebration
Come together
In every nation
- That's right.
- Holiday
Get arrested for that.
Consequences is they may detain her
after the show...
and charge her with indecency.
Last time I was on tour,
Sean was in jail. I guess it's my turn.
She'll do it, but she won't--
Bet she does it more.
- How much you wanna bet?
- I'll bet something small.
I'll trust you.
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat
Incomplete
I'd been had
I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong
Yeah, you make me bold
'Cause your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold
You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I'd nothing to hide
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me
Spokesman for rock singer Madonna
say Metro police...
and Crown Attorney's office threatened
to arrest the star last night...
for lewd and obscene behavior.
However, the police department tonight
has a different story.
Headquarters said officers checked out
the show on complaints...
found nothing wrong
and left without incident.
Madonna released a statement
from Michigan saying...
she would rather cancel the show
than alter it.
Detroit was definitely the hardest
place we went to on the tour...
at an emotional level.
God, going home is--
Well, it's just never
that easy for me.
People always talk about
how stardom changes you...
but they never talk about how it can
change the people close to you.
Hi, Marty.
- Who is that?
- How you doin'?
How's it going?
- This is my brother Martin.
- Hi, Marty.
This is Donna.
Don't pay any attention to her.
- Niki, you gonna say hi to Marty?
- Hi, Marty.
I feel that there is a pressure.
Because of my sister people say...
'How come you're not that?
How come you're not the manager?
How come you're not this,
the other?
You should be this, that.
There is something
they measure against you.
And sometimes I cop an attitude.
But I deal with it.
Well, she's available.
Why don't you talk to her?
She's taking a nap now.
I'm gonna be back here probably
around 7:00.
I can't see anybody
till after the show.
Sounds good. See ya, hon.
We're tight. We talk and stuff.
She gives me advice
and I give her a few tips...
and she gives me a few tips.
We really have
a give-and-take relationship.
We can get past that star bullshit.
She knows what time
it is with me...
and I know what time
it is with her.
Dear Lord, it seems like every time
I'm standing here before the show...
I'm asking for something extra special,
but I'm here again.
They say, 'Ask and you shall receive.'
So, I'm begging You to give me
a voice to sing with this evening...
and the girls too.
This is my hometown,
so I'm extra nervous.
And even though
it's not supposed to matter...
it does matter what they think.
And so I ask You...
to give me...
that little extra something special...
to show everybody here
that I did...
make something out of my life, amen.
Have a great show.
I said it last night,
and I'll say it again.
There's no place like home.
In addition to that...
there's nobody like this man.
There's nobody like my father...
who is here tonight.
And I worship the ground
that he walks on.
And it's his birthday tonight.
I was wondering if I could sing 'Happy
Birthday' in front of 20,000 people?
This is my dad.
I was wondering if
you would all sing it with me.
Ready?
Happy birthday to you
I can't hear you.
Happy birthday
Dear Dad
Happy birthday
To you
Dad, I love you.
Detroit, I love you.
Good night.
Thank you.
So, did my father disown me?
- He looked so happy.
- Really?
Oh, God, I was so afraid
to do 'Like A Virgin.'
- I could tell you were.
- I was like--
Okay, I'm done with that now.
Oh, my God. It was harder
to do that show...
than the police in Toronto.
I was more afraid of what
my actions would result in.
Are you ready for Dad?
Dad, you can come in,
but I gotta get dressed. Come in.
Hi. I better take off
my sweaty clothes.
- You're soaking.
- Sorry.
Let me change.
Did you like the show?
- It was great.
- It was very good. Wonderful.
A little touchy in spots,
but it was great.
I didn't expect 'Happy Birthday.'
Oh, man. I tried not to start
bawling in front of everybody.
It's hard to sing and cry.
Now you know why I'm wiped out.
It's exhausting just watching
everything that's going on around.
I can't do this
for another two months.
I'm sure you're relieved it's over.
That one's over.
That was a big one.
I'm so tired.
The minute you turn your head,
the stuff is all lit on the stage.
Hi. I'm getting a touch-up.
You take a shower already?
I never thought I'd see you
bow at your father's foot.
- I thought that was great.
- I never thought I would either.
I was honored.
A little taken back, but honored.
I thought I had to make up since
I didn't get you a birthday present.
Weren't the sets beautiful?
Didn't Chris do a great job?
Aren't my dancers great?
It was all great.
Some scenes there were...
- X-rated?
- burlesque.
Dad. You don't understand.
They all lead to something.
- Art.
- It's got nothing to do with art.
It's a journey that you go on.
You get on this train,
you have to stay on to the end.
Exactly. You take a journey.
It's cathartic.
You can't get to one place
without going to another place.
It's like growing up.
That's what my show is like.
She's growing up on stage.
My brother's gonna come.
If he has a few friends,
that's fine.
But if he brings a lot of people...
then I want you
to come in here...
and be the chaperon...
because my brother's crazy.
- I know.
- You have to be nice too.
He can't help it.
Thank you.
What's my fart poem?
Should I say it?
Which one?
The one about the beans?
I'm replenishing my fluids.
A fart is a chemical substance.
It comes from a place
called Bum.
It penetrates through the trousers...
and lands with a musical hum.
To fart is no disgrace...
for it gives the body ease.
It warms the blankets on cold winter
nights and suffocates the fleas.
And. Angie said...
'You're not gonna stay
and see Marty?'
Don't leave me alone.
- I'll be here in spirit.
- Bastard.
We went out to get the limousine
and the driver was gone...
because the guy who owned the service
locked his keys in his car.
So I had to wait.
He probably stopped at a bar
for 12 drinks.
No, he didn't.
He's cleaned up.
Oh, yeah.
Dad says he went to alcohol rehab
to escape going to jail.
'He went there
for the wrong reasons.
It wasn't proper motivation.
He doesn't wanna heal himself.
Did Martin come yet?
Did he show up yet?
Oh, well. Thanks.
Martin was supposed to come...
but he didn't.
Big deal.
I think Martin's not coming.
I'm going to bed.
C.
If my brother comes,
you just tell him...
that I'd like privacy, please.
- Hi, Martin.
- How you doing?
- Listen to that low voice.
- I made it lower for you.
- You been crying?
- My Visine.
My eyes got sore.
Where are you going?
- Have a drink with my family.
- You coming back up?
- I'll be back up.
- Where's she at?
She's probably sleeping.
Most likely.
401 I got to find.
I'll be right back.
- What are you looking for?
- 401.
- It's right there.
- It's right here?
It was right in front of me
the whole time.
She's probably sleeping.
Good night.
Sharon, I beat up girls like you
when I was little.
It's true. You know who
she reminds me of?
- Who?
- Of the McFarlands.
Maureen McFarland.
- Hello. Hi.
- Are you Maureen?
You guys.
They're a nice family.
If you think our family's wacky.
I won't say anymore.
There was a time about ten years ago
that I was in Colorado...
and I was gonna go to New York
to see her 'cause she was there...
and I never made it.
I was a dancer on the road.
Different kind. I was topless.
I was really into drugs.
But Moira McFarland taught me
how to shave my legs.
Let me borrow her stuffed bra.
- How old were you?
- Showed me how to use Tampons.
Not very well, I might add.
And taught me how to make out.
Madonna, I did not teach you
how to insert a Tampon.
And if we got in bed together naked,
I don't remember that.
She said she was never in bed
naked with me? She's a liar.
She's got an active imagination.
She's a liar.
Did she say she finger-fucked me?
I remember looking at her bush.
I know.
See what happens when you take drugs
and alcohol. I lose a lot of stuff.
I remember the crack in her parent's
bed because it was two beds together.
I remember I fell through the crack.
We were naked jumping up and down
on the bed too much.
The last time
I really saw her before...
before she became a star...
was when I was in tenth grade.
Where's my idol?
I don't know if I'm nervous.
I just wanna see Madonna.
- You didn't recognize me?
- I didn't know you were coming out.
- I don't have my glasses on.
- So, how are you?
When you see the show, you'll forgive
me for not talking to you.
It's really difficult.
I know. I got five boys.
I gotta ask you something.
Can we sit down?
I can't sit down. I'm sorry.
What's up?
About four years ago,
I wrote you a letter.
You never received it. I asked you
if you would be Mario's godmother.
- I remember that.
- Did you read it?
I got it a long time
after the fact.
Well, very unexpectedly.
Real unexpectedly,
I'm pregnant again.
Really? Oh, my God.
I want you to be
the baby's godmother.
- Really?
- I really do.
You're coming tonight?
And Melissa has all your phone numbers?
- This is too rushed.
- I know.
I'm really flattered that you're asking
me, but I have to think about it.
- But that's really sweet.
- It's nothing to do with religion.
- I know.
- It's spirituality.
Do I get to decide on the name?
As long as it's the same as yours.
Except you've got to bless this child.
-Bless this and say, 'She needs a girl.'
-I would bless it anyways.
Have a girl, Moira.
I gotta go. Come out a girl
and we're gonna call you Madonna.
- All right, gimme a kiss and hug.
- I love you.
- I hope you like the show.
- I have something for you.
Is that the painting?
I'm gonna put it in my room.
Clay, come on.
I love this painting.
Thank you.
Thanks. I'm gonna put it
in my room. I love you too.
- And you call me after the tour.
- I will.
- Promise?
- I promise. Bye.
- I love you, Madonna.
- I love you too.
You little shit.
Look. Moira made
this painting for me.
- She did it herself?
- She did.
It's a Madonna and Child,
no pun intended.
It's not bad, really.
That's me breast-feeding.
Yeah, I got that.
Did you hear me dedicate
a song to her?
- I didn't hear that.
- I did.
In 'Where's the Party.'
I said, 'This one's for Moira,
my childhood idol.'
I remember praying to Madonna,
to her mother Madonna.
It was the closest thing to God.
When her mom died,
I was a little girl and I couldn't--
I remember feeling...
really sad and...
really awful.
But I don't know that anybody went--
I don't remember hugging Madonna
and telling her I'm sorry...
'cause I didn't understand.
I was seven and she was five.
So I just wanted to go back
and hug her.
Little girl
Don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one
who felt all the pain
Little girl
Never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try
But it's not the same
I hadn't been to the cemetery
since I was a young girl.
We used to go
right after she died.
My mother's death was a big mystery
to me when I was a child.
And no one really explained it.
What I remember most about her...
was that she was--
She was very kind and very gentle
and very feminine.
I guess she seemed
like an angel to me...
but I suppose everybody thinks their
mother's an angel when they're five.
I also know
she was really religious...
so I never really understood why
she was taken away from us.
It seemed so unfair.
I never thought that she
had done something wrong...
so oftentimes I wondered
what I had done wrong.
Does she hear my voice
In the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears
It's gonna be all right
I fought to be so strong
I guess you knew
I was afraid
You'd go away too
I wonder what she looks like now.
Just a bunch of dust.
I'm going to fit in right here.
They're gonna bury me sideways.
You've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try
But feels like a lie
Don't let memory
Play games with your mind
She's a faded smile
Frozen in time
I'm still hangin' on
But I'm doin' it wrong
I don't want to stay here anymore.
Can't kiss her good-bye
But I promise to try
This is a show...
that I have no idea
what is gonna happen to my voice.
I don't know where it's gonna
come from, but give me a voice...
and let me put on
a great show tonight.
And let everybody do the same, amen.
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
Let the choir sing
Stand back, please.
Now say--
Breathe.
Good.
Great. Take a breath.
- Good.
- This is crazy.
- Nobody talks about this on film?
- Talks about what?
The insanity of doing this
all on a documentary.
- Why?
- This is a serious matter, your throat.
Why should I stop here?
- But does anyone say it?
- Who's 'anyone'?
Anyone that comes
into this insane atmosphere.
You realize they feel it
when they come into this atmosphere.
When they come to wherever you are,
they feel crazy.
- Now, do they talk about it?
- No. They accept it.
- Why don't they talk about it?
- 'Cause.
- You want to think about that.
- No, I don't.
Let's get back to my throat.
Do you want to talk at all
off camera?
She doesn't want to live off camera,
much less talk.
There's nothing to say off camera.
Why would you say something
if it's off camera?
What point is there, existing?
Eventually, I had to admit
that I was a human being...
and agreed to cancel some shows.
What did she say?
I was told by the doctor
that I couldn't speak...
and I had to write
everything down on paper.
Melissa, my assistant, became...
my only link
to the outside world.
In a lot of ways, New York
and the time I spent there...
while I was sick
was the hardest on her.
Since I was staying in my apartment
in New York...
I lost contact with the dancers.
I had to give
all my messages to Melissa.
Through Melissa I heard they were
finding a lot to keep themselves busy.
I guess I was a little jealous
their lives were going on without me.
Donna Delory,
Madonna's backup singer...
also dancer on the tour.
- Donna, good to have you with us.
- It's great to be here.
Who choreographed
that 'Like A Virgin' number?
Who do you think?
Warren Beatty.
So, Warren.
You know, Donna,
I was reading the radio bible...
which I happen
to have a copy of here.
That thing is so wrong.
Let me read this first,
then you can comment.
'Madonna Dumps Beatty
For a Black Dancer.'
It talks about Slam.
'Madonna Swaps Beatty
For Dancer 31 Years Younger.'
First of all,
that guy's name is Oliver.
These guys are so wrong,
they didn't get the name right.
This is my first time
ever working with fags.
I'm the only straight guy,
and it's six of them.
We're here. We're queer.
Get used to it.
Oh, my God.
You know what else I hate?
Have you ever seen...
Luis walk in just underwear...
in front of
a whole bunch of people?
Just walk around in bikini,
just underwear.
Don't have no respect
for these people.
We know that he's a fag, or gay,
or whatever you want to call it...
but you don't have
to show it to everybody.
- We know you're happy.
- Hi, boys.
We know you're glad to be it,
but you don't have to show it...
Iet everybody know
that you're a fag.
Work, girl!
It was scary. It really was.
They wanted me.
And their thing was:
On this tour, we're gonna get him.
That's what they told me.
When the show started up again,
everything felt different.
There was so much tension.
I blamed myself.
I felt like a mother
who'd deserted her kids...
then comes back home to realize
how much trouble they've gotten into.
Don't touch my man, okay?
If you're going with that property,
you're wrong, baby.
'Madonna Swaps Beatty
For Dancer 31 Years Younger.
Madonna has dumped her lover,
Warren Beatty, for a young dancer...
with the body of a Greek god
and the stamina of a super stud.
The new love in her life
is 22-year-old Oliver Crumes...
also known as Slam.
I just want to tell you that...
I don't think you're guilty
for that thing in the magazine.
I'm not worried
about the magazine.
Oliver, look.
There are always going
to be queens on the rag.
You have to expect that of me.
You got some press,
and they're jealous.
'The fact that he's black
means nothing to Madonna.
She's attracted to him,
body and heart.
But not mind.
All that matters
is your relationship with me...
and not what you do
onstage every night.
I think it's silly.
- You know it's all bullshit.
- I know.
Then why let it bother you?
I'm not letting
them guys bother me.
A lot of crazy shit
is happening right now.
Everybody's gonna have to get over
their ego and pull this group together.
Please try to rise above it, okay?
Don't let it get to you.
All right?
And please don't give me attitude,
because I won't tolerate it.
Is that it?
I understand.
I'm just asking, is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
'During auditions for
her Blond Ambition tour...
she flirted with him openly
from day one.
He wasn't the best of the hundreds
of dancers auditioning.
- That's right.
- You can say that again.
Sometimes I think...
'Oliver, can you really dance?
Should you be on this tour?'
That's the way I feel sometimes,
and it's not good.
It gets to me.
Listen, you guys,
I just want to reiterate...
this thing about Oliver
and stuff.
Please don't pick on him.
I'm not protecting him.
To tell you the truth, I haven't
said a word to him since I got here.
But he's gone.
I don't know where he is.
He's hiding. You three together
can be pretty ferocious.
So be nice to him.
He doesn't have
the thick skin that you have.
He doesn't have the survival
techniques you guys have.
And I want him to perform
in the show.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
I don't believe that you
don't remember things like that.
How could Sharon not know
what happened to her?
She thinks someone drugged her.
She said she was
at the club dancing.
The next thing she knew
was that she woke up...
in her room, nude,
and her stuff was stolen.
She went to the bathroom.
Her butt was bleeding.
I'm sorry I'm laughing.
It's so--
That's all she remembers.
She said she wasn't drinking.
She had cranberry juice.
That's all she had.
They drugged her ass.
All I can think of is
that she started talking about...
how she's on tour with me,
she's staying at the Ritz Carlton...
and those guys got it in their mind
they were going to fuck with her.
I never thought that something
like that would happen to me.
I was fine. I was normal.
I was with the--
Most victims do.
They never thought--
I never thought something like that
would happen to me.
It was a nice club.
It was really nice.
I was just dancing
with these boys.
We were just like--
Like this, and--
I was totally sober.
You can ask my friend
and these other girls I saw.
Then the next thing I know--
I wake up this morning--
I ain't never gonna go out
by myself again.
Never going out by myself again.
I'm going to stick with you guys.
It was days like that...
that I was reminded just how young
the dancers really were.
What was really strange
was that this last show in New York...
was an AIDS benefit
in memory of a friend of mine...
a really good friend of mine...
who had died--
Here I was,
getting ready to go onstage...
to supposedly convince and inspire
thousands of people...
to get unified
and to fight the prejudice...
you know, that--
I couldn't even inspire
seven dancers.
All right.
I think everybody's feeling
a lot better...
today than they were
a couple of days ago.
I'm not worried about the show.
What I am worried about
and want to say a prayer about...
is the way people
have been behaving.
I don't care what you did
with your life before this tour.
I don't care what you do
with them afterwards.
But while you're working with me
and doing this show...
you will treat everyone
in this group...
with kindness, compassion
and respect.
I don't want to hear about it anymore.
There's too much pain in the world.
I want you to treat yourselves
with kindness and respect.
A lot of crazy shit
has been happening.
We have to start
looking out for each other.
And we have to start loving ourselves
a little bit more...
and loving the person
standing next to us a little bit more.
Seeing how this is our last show
in New York...
and our last show...
in the United States...
and we are dedicating it
to Keith Haring...
who doesn't have the luxury
of being alive, like we do...
I beg You...
to let me and everybody in this room
rise above all of our problems...
and go out there
on that stage tonight...
and give the best performance
of our lives.
Do this one for Keith.
Amen.
That's all.
Everybody, have a great show.
Places, please!
Prayer's over.
Places. Have a good show.
- Why did I do that?
- That's all right.
- It's gonna be a great show.
- I hope I can sing.
I hope we all can now.
Do I have mousse in my hair?
One more time for the States?
Should we try to have a holiday?
Yeah, right.
Holiday
Celebration
Come together
in every nation
Holiday
Celebrate
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
Holiday
It would be
It would be so nice
We can turn this world around
And bring back
all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
Come on now
It's time to celebrate
Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together
We can make things better
We need a holiday
All right, everybody!
Do the bus stop!
Oh, yeah!
Let me hear ya!
Now let me hear you scream!
You sing.
If we took a holiday
Everything would be okay
All right, everybody.
Let me hear you say 'Ho'!
All together now.
When we finally got to Europe...
there was such
an overwhelming sense of relief.
After all the tension and darkness,
Europe just felt so glamorous...
and new and exciting.
- Don't make her strike a pose.
- I've been living for Chanel.
Shopping can really
cheer a girl up.
Now, you boys better do what I say.
- Second grade teacher.
- Miss Crabtree.
Or Miss Brooks.
That's a perfect fit.
It's very
'obey everything I say.'
Yeah, it's like very
Janet Jackson, Rhythm Nation.
Bite your tongue.
Do you have any simpler earrings
than these?
They make you look beautiful.
Earrings don't make people
look beautiful.
Money makes people look beautiful.
Hello. Gautier,
listen, I told you.
Hi. Who's this? I'm fine.
Can I help you?
Would you like
anyone in particular?
What's your name?
Chanelta?
Chanelta needs a salesgirl
downstairs now.
Bye-bye. Thank you.
Bye. Thanks.
Happy birthday
Dear Melissa
Yo, Mel.
This is your birthday poem.
'Way back in the beginning...
when I started
all of my sinning...
I needed a partner in crime,
you could say...
so I went on a search
and I started to pray.
I walked into
my manager's office one morn.
I was mouthing out loud
in my usual form.
As my eyes toured the room,
my poor heart skipped a beat...
for there in the corner
was the picture of sweet.
She was glued to the phone.
She was bathed in pastels.
Her Lee press-ons were setting.
They were longer than hell.
I turned and I winked
and I said...
Hey, Miss Muffett, you think
you can work for a bitch?
Can you tough it?
I'm gagging! No way!
Get me outta this dump!
I said, Hey, Freddy,
find a new girl to pump.
So the rest is like history.
Legend, okay?
You want to hear dish?
She don't play it that way.
How can I thank you,
my sweet Melly-Mel?
You pick up my shit
and my undies that smell.
You shield me from assholes
and take all their calls.
You buy me my Tampax
and rubbers and all.
Size large.
'Now, you can't count on much
in this life. I should know.
But I guess I got lucky.
I found me a pro.
She still lives in the Valley...
but her press-ons are gone.
She still goes out with jocks...
but she sips Dom Perignon.
But without you, I'm nothing.
I'm gagging, Miss Thing.
If you ever leave me,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill myself.
Those first few weeks in Europe
were almost perfect.
It felt like
the Partridge Family world tour.
Sort of.
Congratulations!
Don't do it!
He's a tramp!
He's a slut!
Suck it.
Come in only if you're a man.
Girls, I'm here.
Mama Makeup.
Tell Jai Winding that
he doesn't come into 'Prayer.'
When I ask him to play the record,
I'm going to say--
- Voulez-vous will you kiss my dick?
- 'Will you play my record?'
One-track fucking mind, okay.
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Oh, that's really good.
I just pray I remember...
that I have to speak
French and English.
World tour in the year 2025.
Like a virgin
I got the moves, baby
You got the lotion
They don't even let
Zsa Zsa Gabor in this hotel.
- Why not?
- Because she's a cochonne.
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I was sad
I was hurt and blue
But you made me feel
The audiences have been great.
Every show just keeps getting
better and better.
So let us just have
one more great show...
where everybody kicks ass
and has a great time.
I'm fuckin' pissed, okay?
Okay, what are you
fuckin' lookin' at, huh?
When I'm pissed off,
I gotta express myself.
You know
what I'm fuckin' saying?
Sorry about that, Lenny.
Halfway through Europe,
my bubble burst.
I started hearing reports
from ltaly...
that the Vatican was trying
to ban the show.
I am an ltalian-American,
and I am proud of it...
proud of being an American...
because it is the country
I grew up in...
the country that gave me
the opportunities...
to be who I am today...
and a country that believes in
freedom of speech...
and artistic expression.
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard
To hide it well
I was not ready
For the fall
Too blind to see
The writing on the wall
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
I hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
Till then
It will burn inside of me
Truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret
I knew then
Will I
Ever have the chance again
My show is not
a conventional rock show...
but a theatrical presentation
of my music.
And, like theater...
it asks questions...
provokes thoughts and takes you
on an emotional journey...
portraying good and bad,
light and dark...
joy and sorrow...
redemption and salvation.
I do not endorse a way of life...
but describe one...
and the audience is left to make
its own decisions and judgments.
This is what I consider
freedom of speech...
freedom of expression
and freedom of thought.
Every night,
before I go onstage...
I say a prayer...
not only that my show
will go well...
but that the audience
will watch...
with an open heart
and an open mind...
and see it as a celebration...
of love, life and humanity.
If I ran away
I'd never have the strength
To get very far
How could they hear
The beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide
Will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know
The controversy stayed with me
all through ltaly and...
eventually I had
to cancel two shows.
I got my period
suddenly early this month.
Look. This is my gym.
You want to use it?
- If you ever do, you can.
- Sandra--
Born-- Boin-- Or something.
I forgot her last name.
Sometimes I can't pronounce it.
- You know who I'm talking about.
- Try pronouncing it.
Bornhard.
Whatever her name was...
that's one of her best friends.
I had those dreams
when my mother died.
For like a five-year period after that,
that's all I dreamed about--
that people were jumping on me
and strangling me...
and I was constantly screaming
for my father...
and no sound would come out.
What happened when you woke up?
You were crying?
I'd be sweating and afraid
and have to go sleep with my father.
Was that before he got remarried?
How was that
when you slept with him?
Fine. I went right to sleep
after he fucked me. I'm just kidding.
Was he sweet to you?
Of course.
Barngard. Barnyard. Something.
Anyway, you know, she's scary.
So, I had a little fling
with another art world person.
Oh, should I guess?
An art dealer?
- A gallery owner.
- She's pretty sexy.
There's something about her.
She looks like if she was
having sex with someone...
she looks like she'd get a rope
and strap you to the bed.
Ooh, baby! Ow!
- I saw her before I left.
- Really? How unfortunate.
I'm like a drug addict,
you know?
Are you still sleeping with her?
Are you still fucking with her?
- Once in a--
- I don't like her.
I don't either.
Believe me, it's sickening.
I don't like the people
I sleep with either.
That's why you sleep with them--
'cause they're hideous.
By the time this comes out,
it won't matter anymore.
By the time this comes out,
she'll have fucked you over.
She already did.
You know, when I got to meet her
and whatever...
you know, she was pretty cool.
I'm so desperate.
- For what, honey?
- For some fun. It's all work.
- What kind of fun do you want to have?
- This is fun to me.
All I do is hang out
with everybody in the show.
- After a while, it gets boring.
- Who do you want to meet next?
Who do I want to meet next?
Who would really blow you away?
I think I've met everybody.
Just tell me one person.
That would really blow me away?
Who would really rock your world?
The guy that's in all of
Pedro Almodovar's movies.
- Antonio Bandares.
- I know him.
Antonio Bandares
was this Spanish actor...
that I've had a crush on
for two years.
He's in all of
Pedro Almodovar's movies.
I love Pedro's movies.
I've seen every movie
Antonio's ever done.
I have to say he's one of
the few actors...
that I was really dying to meet.
We get to Madrid,
and it turns out...
that Pedro wants to throw
this dinner party for me.
Of course,
Antonio's going to be there.
And so here I am.
I spend the whole week
psyching myself up for this party...
and I've got it
worked out in my head.
I'm going to make Antonio
fall madly in love with me.
Only there is this one obstacle
that I'd never counted on:
- his wife.
- You want?
I've been wanting
to meet Antonio for years.
I finally get to meet him,
and he's married.
-I am.
-That's one of life's little fuck-overs.
Don't worry. I'm just kidding.
Not.
- Oh, wow!
- This is Juan, Spanish star, too.
- Actor, singer.
- Nice to meet you. Are you married?
- Dancer.
- Are you married?
Bye! Bye-bye!
Hey, knock it off, fellas.
- What's wrong, baby?
- I've got to go drown my sorrows.
- Girl, you're ready to snatch him.
- I'm putting my head in the toilet.
Don't do it till we get home.
I said to Ricky, 'Fuck. This is
such a disaster. He's married.'
He goes, 'ln Spain it doesn't matter.
You can have whatever you want.'
- Just like in ltaly.
- Good thing I don't live here.
I would be a fighting bitch.
Is that man beautiful, or what?
There's gotta be
something wrong with him.
He probably has
a really small penis.
There's gotta be something wrong
with him. Nobody's that perfect.
I'm gonna go back in the room,
and who am I going to flirt with?
- I know who.
- That little shit.
The guy next to us.
Oh, my beautiful men.
I will sue them both. Go!
- Yes.
- You have to call me.
I'll call you.
- Tomorrow, right?
- Yes, yes, I'll call you.
Bye-bye.
Needless to say, I never saw
or heard from Antonio again.
I don't think he's such
a good actor after all.
Were there any messages?
No messages.
Madonna! Madonna!
My sleeping pill
didn't wear off yet.
So...
if I start acting like
Joey Heatherton, you'll understand.
Even when I feel like shit,
they still love me.
I think Madonna's a lot happier now
than on the last tour.
She's happy with
the effect she's had.
But I think there's a part of
her life that makes her unhappy.
I don't think
she takes enough time...
to appreciate and enjoy
her success.
She only thinks of the dance steps
she might have missed or--
Madonna does feel
more in control...
when she doesn't extend
her personal emotion...
her love, her exposure
to sensitivity too much.
Madonna's very difficult to reach.
She's put up many barriers.
I'm sure she's going through
a lot with these things...
'cause there's not many people
she can trust and get close to...
'cause I'm sure everyone
wants something from her.
She's fishing for affection.
I suppose she's fishing for people
who can be real and honest with her.
I don't really think
anybody is honest with her...
except for maybe me.
I'm certainly not honest
all the time.
We're all seeking Madonna's approval
to some degree.
Sometimes I feel like
she really trusts me...
and sometimes I feel like
she's not really looking at me.
Madonna has a hard time
connecting...
and giving herself away
to any one person.
I feel like she's--
Madonna's very in the moment.
She's very impatient.
Madonna's quite impatient.
It's just 'cause
she wants things done.
She has a lot to do.
She has a busy life.
She's definitely
in a race against time.
Everything is subject
to her approval...
or disapproval.
Everything has to do with what
she wants, what she doesn't want...
how it should look,
where it should go, what it should be.
It's very tense.
She's unhappy a lot of the time.
She's a bitch sometimes.
Madonna can be mean, if she wants to.
We all can.
A nice, relaxing morning.
- I love it when she's mean.
- She hasn't been a bitch to me.
She knows what she's doing.
She knows how to work.
That's probably why
she's such a big star.
I feel like she's a little girl
lost in a storm sometimes.
There's just like
a whole whirlwind of things...
going on around her and...
sometimes she
gets caught up in it.
Strike a pose.
Vogue, vogue, vogue
Look around
Everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go
Look around
You try everything you can
to escape
The pain of life that you know
When all else fails
and you long to be
Something better
than you are today
I know a place
Where you can get away
It's called a dance floor
And here's what it's for
So come on, vogue
Let your body move
to the music
Hey, hey, hey
Let your body go with the flow
You know you can do it
All you need
is your own imagination
So use it
That's what it's for
Go inside
for your finest inspiration
- Your dreams will open the door
- Open up the door
It makes no difference
if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
The music's pumping
It will give you new life
You're a superstar
Yes, that's what you are
Let your body groove to the music
Groove to the music
Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you
bump and grind it
Soul is in the musical
That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical
Life's a ball
So get up on the dance floor
To a roomful of people
that I admire...
that I appreciate,
that I adore...
that I love...
and that I would all separately
at one time or another...
Iike to smack the shit out of.
Anyway, cheers.
To fashion.
To love. To I'amour.
Grace Kelly, Harlow, Jean
Picture of a beauty queen
Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire
Ginger Rogers
dance on air
They had style
They had grace
Rita Hayworth gave good face
Lauren, Katharine, Lana too
Bette Davis, we love you
Ladies with an attitude
Fellas that were in the mood
Don't just stand there
Let's get to it
Strike the pose
There's nothing to it
You got to let your body move
To the music
You got to just
Let your body go with the flow
Truth or dare, Madonna?
- Want to play?
- Right now?
Have you ever
been fucked up the ass?
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.
You fucked up.
Unzip your pants
and take your dick out.
You have to do it!
Oh, bravo!
Oh, my God.
Come on!
You could sit down and do it.
- No way!
- Way!
Dare. Come on.
That's what she told you to do.
I'm afraid to look.
It's fucking blue!
Slam, truth or dare?
Dare.
French kiss Gabriel.
He's up and he's ready!
Look out!
Work him!
They want this.
They want this to happen.
- Grab that head!
- Oh, yes!
Get it done.
Get the job done.
- Goddamn it!
- Oh, my God!
I'm getting a hard-on, okay?
Just beautiful.
There, buddy.
Madonna, truth or dare?
- Dare.
- Dare?
Show us with that bottle
how you give head.
Stand up and come down on it.
You're not asking
the question, motherfucker.
You're not performing either.
Oh, my-- Oh, my God!
Bravo!
Encore! She swallows!
- Madonna, truth or dare?
- Truth.
Who has been the love of your life
in your whole life?
My whole life?
- Sean.
- Your mama.
I'm in my dressing room sometimes
and I think to myself...
'Who do I think I am,
trying to pull this off?'
And sometimes I'm very much--
I can only allow myself
to think it once in a while...
because if I do, I'm gone.
And that is,
I think of you guys...
sitting in
your dressing room going...
'Who does this bitch
think she is?'
I got the moves, baby
You got the motion
If we got together
we'd be causing a commotion
I know I'm not the best singer
and not the best dancer...
but I'm not interested in that.
I'm interested in
pushing people's buttons...
and being provocative
and political.
It doesn't matter
if you win or lose
It's how you play the game
so get into the groove
You both could have anything
you wanted, if you want it.
That's where I'm at right now.
I don't know if I want it.
It ain't all fuckin' hunky-dory.
I hope you find
what you're looking for
Is it mine
Walk through that door
We're wasting time
Make up your mind
Get into the groove
- You knew you wanted to be a star.
- But don't you?
You wanted to say
what you wanted to say.
You don't want to be in touch?
Oh, yeah,
pick on the little girl.
Get over here!
Carlton, come to Mommy.
Get in bed.
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.
I'm finally alone
in bed with you.
- Slam, take your shirt off.
- You want me to take it off?
Pull the sheets up
so it looks like you're naked.
Yes, of course.
- Oh, I'm so shocked.
- Oh, my God.
I'm gagging.
- Why are you wearing your underwear?
- Why not? I'm in bed.
- Did you walk here in your underpants?
- You're acting like me.
If he doesn't sleep with--
Wait. I'm talking.
You know what that means.
I just think life is unfair.
Here I am.
Everybody thinks I have everything I
want, but I want you and can't have you.
You shouldn't have any more sex.
You should build an altar to me
in your home...
and worship it daily...
and call me collect.
- I've called him insane.
- You're the only woman I love.
You lied, Luis!
Now I'm going to beat you up.
I wouldn't hire fags
that hate women.
I kill fags that hate women.
In fact, I kill anybody
that hates women.
In fact, I'll kill anybody
that hates...
because I hate people
that hate.
Ollie, I hate you.
I hate you because you're beautiful
and you're a fuck.
I hate you.
You're sweating, and you smell!
Oh, your dick is big.
Come on.
My aunt wrote a book called Men Who
Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them.
- You should read it.
- I think I helped her write it.
- All right. You want it.
- Pupils.
Did I hurt you? Good.
Get out of my bed.
Don't come back
until your dick is bigger.
See how you
won't get away from me?
Don't leave me.
Get out now,
or I'm calling the police.
What's wrong?
- My life is really complicated.
- If I have to leave, hand me my pants.
I'd rather die!
Get out!
Get out, you bastard!
Smell them.
I'm outta here.
I'm leaving.
Oh, look.
Does anybody give a shit?
Don't ever come back.
I hate you. Next.
- I'd give you the shirt off my back.
- Take it off, girl.
Take if off!
It's not time for a feeding!
Get away!
She's been trying to feed the boys.
Feel better now?
Madonna's Vegas show.
What do we think of people
that have body parts that aren't real?
But we love you anyway, Madonna.
Honey, my titties
are the real thing.
Who said anything about titties?
You mean my hair?
Keep going.
- What's not real?
- Everything's real on you.
- They just don't think so.
- I think so.
- I'm real, you guys.
- Except for the pearls.
- They are, too, real.
- All of them?
Madonna can't afford real pearls
I can so! I'm rich.
I can have anything I want.
She sleeps with boots!
Do we want to be accepted
by Hollywood?
Do we care
what people think of us?
Do we want people
to kiss our ass?
Yeah, we do.
But do we want to have
an 'R' rating or an 'X' rating?
'X'!
'X' for extra fun!
One child grows up to be
Somebody who just loves to learn
And another child
Grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn
Mom loves
The both of them
You see
it's in the blood
Both kids are good to Mom
Blood's thicker than the mud
It's a family affair
Keep people together
It's a family affair
Hi, hi, hi!
- Hello.
- Hello, love.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my lovely family.
Aren't we just having
a lovely time?
A lovely time.
'Cause I've got something
to say to you.
Keep people together
Keep people together
forever and ever
We're a wild and crazy bunch.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, love.
Take me where I'm going.
This is what I call
traveling in style.
Yeah, that's right.
Thank you, Ollie.
All right. Formation.
I've hit the big time
But I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger
City life can get to you
People can be so cold
Never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something
Always wanting something back
When I get lonely
And I need to be loved
for who I am
Not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters
They've always been there for me
We have a connection
Home is where the heart should be
Keep it together
in the family
They're a reminder
of your history
Brothers and sisters
they hold the key
To your heart
and your soul
Don't forget
that your family is gold
When I look back
On all the misery
And all the heartache
that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it
for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker
Than any other circumstance
All right, time for a little bit
of the old in-out, you know.
The family that plays together
stays together.
Here we go.
One!
Two! Come on, love.
One, two.
One, two, three. Hit it!
Unfortunately, Europe...
it's time for us to say bonsoir.
To all of our families.
You're my family.
Yeah, that's right.
And never forget...
that your family is your friend.
Yeah, that's right.
And never doubt
that without them...
you are nothing.
Yeah, that's right.
But most of all
and most importantly...
never doubt yourselves.
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, ladies.
On your knees.
Aren't they lovely?
It's okay.
Thanks.
- What are you thinking about?
- You.
Bye. I love you.
You're so big, Carlton.
And you're such a lady.
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, you guys.
Don't get into any catfights
on the way home.
- Ready?
- Yes, Mom.
Let's say our good night prayer.
All right.
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die
before I wake...
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.
God bless:
- Did I forget anyone?
- Carlton.
- That's right.
- He's an adopted child.
- It's time to say good night.
- Am I adopted?
Time to say good night, everybody.
I want some ice cream.
- I want some vanilla ice cream.
- Shut up, Carlton.
Close your eyes.
Dream some dreams.
I gotta pee.
Just pee in bed.
- You know what he's doing?
- Not on me.
Don't say anything.
Good night, boys and girls.
Good night, Madonna.
Good night, Niki-Ellen.
Good night, paupers.
Good night, Chita.
Good night, Lou.
Who farted?
Shut up! Shut up
and go to sleep!
She smelled it.
She smelled it,
and she dealt it.
You stinky.
You stinker.
Somebody farted boots.
Somebody farted!
Nuclear testing!
Oh, gross.
I smell boots!
We're smelling boots!
I think I got my period.
You guys. Shut up!
Ow! She hurt me!
Sleepy time.
I said shut up!
I'm going to press this thing.
I'm going to press power.
When I press it, the camera's
going to go off instantly.
Go away!
Cut it. Cut it, Alec.
Cut it, goddamn it.
