It's dark here.
What happened?
It's so dark here!
Then turn on the light.
Where's the switch?
I'm scared.
Nothing could be more romantic
than in here in all Goa.
Nobody will find out.
Who's bungalow is this?
In such a big empty house is
me, you and...
a GHOST.
Have you brought any food or not?
Offcourse I have,
You know what I've arranged?
Candle light dinner and champagne.
So you prepare the dinner, I'll go
get freshen up. Okay me too.
I'll go get freshen up,
You prepare the dinner.
You're still here!
Please let's go downstairs,
I'm very hungry.
But you were standing
here just now.
Why would I be standing there?
I was downstairs preparing dinner.
Then who was that?
Now you're trying to scare me.
Please close the window or
the candle will blow.
Close the window.
Someone's there.
I just saw someone.
You're delusional.
Why are you shouting?
It's just electricity.
Tina, there's no electricity.
TV can't be on.
Let's see.
I saw something.
Is there anyone?
Look here.
Hey give me the key.
Hey Anthony, get up.
Leave.
I'll live here,
I'll take care of it.
Can't take care of himself.
Going to take care of the bungalow!
Come on get up.
Leave.
Hey bungalow is mine.
No one can dare to live here
except me.
A ghost live here.
Who's going to live here?
Where's our house?
There.
That isn't our house.
How would you know? You were a
sleep when we came to look.
They were just fighting for it,
what happened?
No will take you there.
Why?
I'd say, It's better if you don't
go there too.
If you don't want to go, fine.
We'll take another taxi. Come Banku.
Listen Sir.
I'll take you.
By the way the other taxi drivers,
Why didn't they want to go NathVilla?
Are you related to Mr. Nath?
No.
We've rented that bungalow?
Get another bungalow,
Why are you taking the risk?
Why?
What's wrong?
They say a spirit lives there.
A ghost lives there.
Ghosts aren't real.
I think car won't move forward.
So,
Do we have to walk?
Yes,
You'll have to walk from here.
It's not far, come Banku.
Let's carry your mommy.
We're at the NathVilla.
You're Mr. Aditya, Right?
Come down, Monkey.
It's so big.
It's even bigger than grandpa's
house.
Let me show inside of the
bungalow.
It's jam.
How long has it been close?
Not long,
I just had it cleaned up.
I had it cleaned when I heard
you were coming.
It's cleaned very well!
It's cleaned allright.
You'll do the rest anyway.
Seems like have to break the
glass.
Banku, What are you doing?
Uncle just said so.
No worry,
We'll get another one.
Then I'll break the whole.
I don't know how am I going
to handle all of it.
Will you open the door now
that it's broken.
Wow,
Such a big house.
Old people made houses very
well.
You're company...
Couldn't they find a medium size
house to give us.
There's a terrace too,
Wow, Really!
Banku be careful, stairs.
Sister, Water comes 24 hours here.
Do laundry anytime you want.
Your sister need just an hour
to do laundry and other washing.
Go see the kitchen.
Listen.
I have to ask you something.
I've heard rumors about this
house.
Even taxi driver was saying
that here...
Ghost.
It's all rubbish.
Actually the owner lives in America.
All responsibilities of this house
are on me.
That's why they're joulous,
and talk rubbish about this house.
Believe me sir,
It's nothing like that.
What happened? Banku.
What happened Banku?
Papa, lt'll be so much fun playing
cricket here.
Then Why were you shouting?
You know your mom got scared.
I wasn't scared.
But I was scared.
Your son is very naughty.
Come downstairs.
Kids have to be naughty.
By the way, How many children
you have?
I have two daughters,
They're very peaceful.
Whole day I have to stay out
because of work.
Offcourse, Have to stay out
because of work.
Now take me for example.
I usually out for months.
Months!
Meaning?
I'm a chief engenier on a cruise liner.
So I have to go where ever
the cruise goes.
And he leaves us alone.
That's why I want a house...
where they both are safe.
They are safe here,
You don't need worry at all.
Yes, I almost forgot.
So, what else I had made?
Nothing,
Sandwiches are our favorite.
Sandwich in lunch,
Sandwich in dinner, Sandwich.
Will mom give sandwich in Tiffin
here too?
No, she'll make noodles too
sometimes.
I can hear everything.
When's your cruise leaving?
In two days.
No, Not at all.
You won't go anywhere unless
this house is all set. Yes papa.
No son,
I have to go.
I don't want to eat this sandwich
anymore.
Don't be mad.
Look don't stay bed in the morning.
Wake up when the alarm rings.
Or Banku will miss his school.
First straighten that little thunder
of yours.
That he'll control his misbehaving.
We can only ask him to do
what he can.
I'll tell him.
Banku look.
New trouble in new school, Okay.
Not the old ones.
And look.
Don't trouble your mom at all.
I've told him,
He's in control now.
The kid understands English.
Don't scold me in front of him,
he won't respect me when he's older.
Banku, close your eyes,
I'm going to kiss your mom.
Who cooks food in your house?
Actually we just moved.
So I cook for now but...
You cook by yourself.
It's good for taste.
It's good for the child's health,
It's good for all of us.
What is your name?
Banku.
Banku!
Actually his real name is Aman.
We call him Banku with love.
Banku, I'll also call you Banku
with love, Okay.
Such a nice kid.
He just seems nice.
He's not.
Such innocent eyes he have.
You'll come to school everyday,
Right?
You'll bring Tiffin everyday, Right?
Kid's often get scared on first day.
He's not one of those.
After Tommorow other kids will
cry.
I like naughty kids very much.
You and me will do the mischief's
together.
I'll show you your classroom.
She's speaking to you.
Children, Say good morning to sir.
Bread and scacks?
Don't know sir.
But do you know what do
I have for you?
A new friend.

I'll see you in the recess.
Why did you laugh at my name?
Why did you laugh at my name?
Look Jojo is fighting again.
We'll see him in the recess.
Trying to be smart.
Stop.
You're the ghost of the house!
I'm not the ghost,

But no child have done something
like this to me.
If you tell me anything...
You're facing the other way.
You want to look!
You're laughing!
You're looking so funny that
I couldn't control.
Please control.
Mrs. Sharma control your laughing...
...and this boy too.
He's not innocent,
He's a devil.

So, You're Jojo.
You changed the ink.

There's a ghost there.
Mom,
What is ghost?
When you don't do your homework.
The one who will come to straighten

Everyone says that.
Son,
Ghosts aren't real.
A theig was hiding in our house.
Anthony, He used scare people off.
I beat him today and ran off.
Did you beat him!?
Yes.
He was stealing things from
the kitchen.
I took all of his ghosts off.
You mean the ghost was inside him!?
Ghosts aren't real.
Angels are.
Angels!
What are they?
When God is happy with someone.
So he makes them Angel.
Like your Grandpa.
When your Grandpa went to God.
So God said that
You're Banku's Grandpa!
I will make you a star.
That you can see Banku forever.
Have you ever seen an Angel?
I have.
And his name is Banku.
What will I do If I find an Angel?
Make him your friend.
Tell him your stories.
How will he look?
If he's been sent by Grandpa...
...then he'll look like him.
Then I'll recognize him.
Papa's phone!
Banku, be careful,
Stairs.
Papa.
Wow, Rascal!
How did you that Papa's calling?

I never let anyone live in this house.
Then he came.
He changed me.
I forgot that i am not alive.

Now only you will live in this house.
Banku will live here.
You cant go from here.
Cant go.
Is he still here?
Where he is right now?
Kelash Nath use to love his
son a lot.
So him he made several prays
in this temple.
Now he heart is attach to your son.
That's what i am worried about.
What if he do anything to Banku...
no, Kelash never harm anyone.
He wont do any thing.
Then what we should do now?
Sherd (pray)
For his peace, we need to pray.
But only his son can do it, right?
Yes he should do it.
By the way after Kelash died, never
made prays for his peace.
Who would do, son was overseas.
I have heard he is here nowadays.
Then, i will talk to him for once,
i think!!
Your son can make Kelash peach.
Even God listen to the kids.
God will full fill his prays difinetly.
When ever i come to Goa i come
here definitly.
You come to Goa, but don't come
to own house.
You are staying there...
and you want to let us out from there?
I am demolishing Nath Villa.
This after saleing the land i will left
Goa for ever.
So then there wont be any house
more any ghost.
Not ghost, sole.
Your father's dissatisfied sole.
Dissatisfied?
Dissatisfied...
father always was dissatisfied with me.
He never understood me.
Or maybe you, never understand him?
You father's heart is attached to
his home.
He don't wont to break the house
full with your mother's memories.
Maybe that's why his sole is still
wandering.
I don't believe in all this.
My father's sole disturbed everyone
except me.
Not disturbing...
just proving his appearance,
you know a lot about my father.
When you were about to left
the house.
Your father tried to stop his son.
His foot slip, and he fall, and may be.
May be called for help.
But his son didn't look back even
for once.
That was an accident.
That's what you think.
What do you mean, i killed my
father?
You know nothing.,
i was not wrong, he didn't understand,
that...
and you are not understanding
very small thing.
Vijay, you only have appoligise...
and with you father...
for once ask for appoligise at house.
So you came to tell me what i have
to do?
I have come to tell you...
that for your father's sole we
made prays,
we are make pray.
They don't made prays in America,
even people get peach there.
Father's pray should made by son.
You do it, what ever you want.
I will come to collect the key of
house next day.
All right.
I will left Parsad for you.
By the way i don't believe in all this
too,
but i believe that...
some work always left undone.
This pray will left undone without you.
We are making prays tomorrow,
for your Bhoothnath.
Yea, is it his birthday?
For his new birth.
For his peach,
mukti (peace) what is that?

My eyes will stick on you.
Promises me you will look at me
every day.
Promises, but what if clouds come?
Even God cant come between us.
Promises you will not bother your mother?

Promises me you will not leave
your parents.
That much promises at once?
Bhootnath you are only getting peace,

All right, last promises...

to anyone.
And you will always forgive everyone.
I will not forgive anyone.

It is essential.
Just like by washing dirty cloth it

You were right.
Some work always left undone.
With father...

I am sorry, because of me your
Bhoothnath has gone.
You tell him, this house will be

And from now on, it will be yours.
And tell him that he forgive me.
