My name's Griffith, what's yours?
Guts.
What is this place?
Band of the Hawk.
I want to build my own kingdom.
Guts, I will tell you how to live and when to die.
Is there no one able to defeat those
Black Tudor demons?
Stand back! This man's my- my-
Beware that when this man's dream collapses...
...death will come upon you...
...from which you won't be able to escape.
Behelit.
It's said that in exchange for his own flesh and blood...
...its bearer will become the ruler of the world.
Murder?
It's a filthy request, will you do it?
All this talking is unusual from you.
Your words, my command.
The life that seeks to live another day...
...is unacceptable.
A friend... in my mind...
...won't follow another's dream.
He picks up his own dream and stands for it...
...against anyone in the path.
Even if it were me...
For me, a friend is...
...someone I would consider my equal.

The life that seeks to live another day...
...is unacceptable.
The Band of the Hawk have become crucial.
They managed to push back the enemy on their own.
Griffith, you really are incredible.
Count Julius' murder is a tragedy.
It is indeed a great loss for our army.
The Band of the Hawk's support is crucial.
Damn... Not now.
Here's the woman leader of the Hawks.
I can't understand why a woman would dress as
a knight.
You must have earned this title...
...due to your skills in bed with your leader Griffith.
Arsehole.
The battlefield is a sacred place in which
women have no place.
I, Blue Whale Elite Knights' commander
Lord Adon, will make you pay for this!
Leader!
Commander Casca!
No! Don't come any closer!
Out of my way, losers!
That's the fate that awaits such cowards.
Take this!
What's happening? Are you numb?
A woman commanding an army, what a joke!
This whole Hawk group is just a joke!
Oh... You actually look pretty good.
I'll give you one more chance.
What do you say about joining us Tudors?
What?
Don't worry. Not as a commander as
you lack the required skills.
But you could be the main Tudor army whore.
You're disgusting!
Do you reject?
Farewell... then die!!!
Guts!
You aren't yourself...
Bastard...
Come on!
I feel I'm going to enjoy this battle.
You did well avoiding my attack,
but your luck ends here!
You're going to suffer a fighting skill
passed down the Boscovich family for 140 years!
Take this! Rock Cutter Whirlpool!!!
Rock cutter whirlpool? Right?
What are you doing?
You're not like usual.
If you're not careful during the fight and you...
Casca!
Pull yourself together! Cas...
Damn...
Commander! Captain! Guts!
Guts!
Casca!
That's the last time I swim in a goddamn armour.
She's burning hot, a strong fever.
I need to find shelter quicky.
Guts and casca...?
Falling from this high could be lethal...
...and Guts was hit by an arrow.
We must dispatch a rescue team!
Lord Griffith, it's only two soldiers who fell
in the middle of a war.
We can't afford that!
Furthermore, aren't they the Hawk's commander
and raiders leader?
They should make it through without help.
Yes... Indeed.
I'll have to remove her clothes.
Going to war with such a fever.
Was she serious?
Damn she's hit? But where?
That's what was behind it.
Being a woman must be hard.
Come back!
If you have something to protect, take this sword.
Where are we?
In a cavern near the river.
We were lucky enough to fall in it.
The river?
Idiot, keep it low.
You still have fever.
I didn't had much choice.
You were frozen, shaking and your clothes were wet.
Why are you staring at me?
Ahh... Don't you thi-
What's wrong with you?!
Damn, will you stop yo-
Goddamnit will you stop your madness?! Fool!
You're so self concerned you didn't even
notice that I saved your life!
I had to swim with my armour to get you out of water
and this is how you thank me? If you weren't a girl,
I would have crushed you!
A woman.
You're so hot tempered, especially during those times.
That's why women aren't fit for battle.
What?
I didn't choose to be born a woman!
What a shame! To think you're the one who
rescued me.
I would have wanted anyone else but you.
Hey , go easy.
She really hates me.
Do you remember...
...what Griffith on said on the hill?
I want you Guts.
Griffith never said such things...
...to anyone.
Why are you, so selfish, able to make him say that?
Why?
I only mean to protect him and become his sword.
I see.
So this is your dream.
Are you sure it was here?
Damn sure.
They must be dead...
...no way they could make it through.
Lord Adon will promote us if we find them.
Let's go check futher down the river.
We should move soon to get back to the band.
But... what's yours?
What are you fighting for?
Keep your mouth shut. You'll run out of breath.
I'd like...
Seems like I finally found you, smartarse.
Kinda persistent, old man!
Him again.
Shut up! Let me enjoy your slow death!
Thanks to the secret Koboritz torturing technique,
passed down for 200 years...
called the "Secular Boscovich Slaughter" you will be
ripped apart, bones and flesh!
And my men will take care of this female.
Quite frankly, I wouldn't recommend it...
...as she might tear you to pieces!
Don't underestimate me! I'll show you!
I'm gonna contain 'em, just run off the forest!
What?
Quick! You're losing your time!
Who do you think I am? I won't leave you behind!
Don't misunderstand me!
You're still recovering, and would be a burden.
Archers, aim for the girl.
Fire!
Guts!
Fool.
Protecting a woman, what a great sense of honor.
Why? Why?
You told me you wanted to become his sword, and protect him.
You must go back to whom you belong, back to Griffith.
As for me... I'll think about what you asked me.
What are you afraid of? They're only two!
Surround them and crush them!
Go! Go! Don't waste your time!
I'll come back with reinforcements so...
...don't you die!
Don't let her run! Take her down!
Before you think of chasing her...
...you'll have to deal with me!
Don't die...
He can't use his left hand anymore...
...so he won't be able to swing his huge sword!
It's finally begun to get interesting.
Not pretty fast, lady.
You son of a-
Easy now!
Can't move my arm.
Don't think of biting your own tongue,
I won't enjoy it if you die now.
You must go back to whom you belong.
I won't bite my own tongue...
...but...
...there's no way I'll let you take me!
Bitch!
You're going to pay!
Are you ok, Casca?
Quick!
Guts! To allow me to escape, he stood against
a whole battalion of the enemy!
Hurry up everyone we have to rescue him!
What am I doing here...
...risking my life...
...in such a place.
What's the point?
A dream which is his.
A dream he'll reach for himself.
The life that seeks to live another day...
...is unacceptable.
A friend, in my mind, is my equal.
You cowards! You're Tudor soldiers!
I don't have time to think.
To fight... To kill.
Nothing else matters.
Hold on, we're almost here!
This way!
Incredible.
All of them, he-
at least 100 of them!
Guts? Are you here?
Answer me Guts!
Guts!
Capitain!
Capitain Guts!
He looks bad.
Guts! Remember, you promised not to die!
I kept my word, so keep yours!
Guts!
Shut up.
And stop shaking me...
...or you'll end up killing me.
Amazing!
The captain's a beast!
Who thought he could die?
Damn!
Guts, the 100 man slayer of the Hawk!
Captain, the 100 man slayer!
Fire!
It's unbelievable no man could breach their defences.
Doldrey really is invulnerable.
The Purple Rhino Knights, Boscogn, and his cavalry.
This fortress really matches her reputation.
Boscogn's Elite Knights keep the walls, and
charge on the battlefield.
The Purple Rhino Knights crushed everyone in their path.
The White Tigers, our army elite, was destroyed.
We suffered three times more loss than the enemy.
What's new? We already know that!
Doldrey was once Midland's impenetrable fortress.
It won't fall so easily.
Seems a civil war is building for the Tudor's Throne succession.
Despite their strength, they might not be able to strike
with all their force.
And they can't afford to make this war longer.
We must seize this opportunity!
Doldrey is Tudor's Empire main door!
Should we win this war...
...we would recover our lands, and end over 100 years of conflict.
A golden opportunity that will not last.
But...
Tudor is surely planning a strike back.
Would you like to attempt an all out offensive?
I'm opposed to that.
The army's morale is eroded,
and there are some reports of soldiers deserting.
The remaining White Tigers few and wounded.
Not forgetting that we're in an offensive campaign.
We might get stuck between two conflicts...
...and would have to capitulate.
Should we keep going on with this war,
we would need to increase the tax on the civilians...
...which could lead to their rebellion.
I suppose the Band of the Hawk has no better idea?
With the order we could...
Obviously that's impossible.
Even for a genuine strategic warchief,
there are limits none can break. Unless...
Should it be his Highness' command...
..it wouldn't cost the entire army.
The Band of the Hawk alone should be enough.
What did you just say?
Don't be foolish!
How could your few Hawks overrun Doldrey?
Even the elite White Tiger Knights failed there.
Are you serious?
This means 5,000 knights against 30,000.
Bullshit! He's lost his mind!
No one has ever been able to take over Doldrey
in the last hundred years.
There is no way you could win alone!
Lord Griffith.
Are you certain you can do this?
I command the Band of the Hawk to besiege Doldrey!
Band of the Hawk?
Yes, 5000 soldiers are coming this way.
5000 to besiege Doldrey? Are they nuts?
General Boscone!
Yes!
I want you to spare Griffith's life.
What?
I want you to bring him alive to me.
But.
Should their leader be held captive, the Hawks...
...no, the whole Midland army would attack us.
General Boscone!
Is that clear?
Yes!
Damn, we got to deal with the assault.
The fort has two heavy wall layers.
Mounted with at least 20 brand new cannons.
Not to mention the oil, arrows, and boulder falls.
It's almost too much to summarise!
You forget to mention the Purple Rhinos!
Can we really win this?
Guts?
Yeah?
Nothing to worry about! It's just a bigger castle!
Everything will be fine as long as we follow
Griffith's command.
Isn't it strange?
Attacking with the river behind means no retreat option. Does he even know the art of war?
Whatever his plan is...
...they don't stand a chance being outnumbered like this.
But still he dares attacking frontally.
Griffith...
...I'm so impatient.
Lord Adon, safe and sound!
Hi!
Nothing to report?
Be ready!
First group, prepare yourselves!
Raise your swords!
First group, charge!
The enemy's moving.
Griffith's leading around 2000 men.
Despite his little army, he split it in two?
Exposing himself in the front lines.
Interresting, I will accept his challenge.
Soldiers, charge! Crush everything on your way!
Follow the captain!
How? This didn't stop them!
They went through the Rhinos lines!
The enemy is way too fast.
General... the enemy is still coming.
Don't worry.
They're taking advantage of their light
cavalry over our heavy cavalry.
But our archers will pierce through them like paper.
My experience will prevail on them!
It was going too well.
They're trying to break our formation.
Boscone, what are you up to?!
You'll end up killing Griffith!
First group, retreat! Fall back to the group!
Come on guys, follow him!
What? They're coming back!
The enemy is retreating!
With such a simple rush, a counter attack is too obvious.
These are the so called invincible Hawks?
What's this mess, Boscone?
Governor Gennon!
The enemy is running away and here you are!
Shouldn't you go after them?
But...
Listen to me soldiers! I command you to bring me
Griffith, the Hawk leader, alive and...
...I promise you'll be well rewarded!
But be sure nothing happens to him, understood?
Governor, such words will only confuse our army.
General Boscone, if it is too hard for you...
...I, Gennon, shall take command.
You Purple Rhinos, the Blue Whales, and Black Wolves...
...everyone go after them now...
...and we'll make sure we make it back with him.
He's emptying the castle's forces.
What's happening?
Will you disobey, General Boscone?
General?
Don't worry.
We'll just have to get rid of the Hawk leader!
I won't put victory aside for his delusional thoughts.
Very well.
Follow me! We're going for them!
Well...
...seems pretty serious this time!
Back in position!
There's no way out! It's the enemy or the river!
Let's defy death together! This is our chance!
Those who live shall celebrate victory!
The enemy is overwhelmed.
Drive them back before they react!
No... We must keep our positions!
You won't push me in the river! I'd rather
die by the sword!
Hey, Rickert's all crazy!
Who are you?
First line Hawk's raid leader, Guts!
No way to see what's happening with this dust.
Doesn't matter, we will win for sure!
I'd love to leave just for a cup of wine.
Rumor says the governor offered a reward
for capturing the enemy's leader.
While we just waste our time here.
What? Is there a problem?
How... the enemy? Enemy troops!
This is bad.
Lord Adon, intruders are in the castle!
Hurry!
Hurry, shut those doors!
No one should leave the castle!
Kill the remaining soldiers, follow the plan.
Every second matters!
Everything is going as Griffith planned, amazing!
This is the opportunity I waited for, woman!
If you think you'll have it your way, you're wrong!
This time, you won't escape me!
Commander Casca!
Leave it to me.
We have a score to settle!
Prepare yourself!
Amazing.
So strong.
Boscone... why are you wasting your time?
Keep it up! They're falling back!
How can this be possible?
Last time, you were so much weaker!
If I hadn't been sick, a worm like you
wouldn't have been a problem to deal with.
Boss, you really are the best!
They is still undone business here,
get everything ready!
Guts!
Damn Boscone.
I'm hitting with such strength and momentum...
...that your arms are suffering...
...and your sword's going to break.
Well, seems your not talkative anymore.
Uh? The assault forces captain?!
Got you!
I won!
This trick has passed over generations
of the Boscovich family.
I fooled you!
Boss! Commander Casca!
It's ok, stay out of this!
Hum! Still playing brave...
...humiliated in front of your men.
Will you try a desperate move?
I will delight myself of your skin...
...and teach you how a male can please a woman.
Delight yourself with this!
As expected from Commander Caska.
She mastered him.
We're late, hurry up!
We're coming to help you!
Let me take him!
No! You're no match for him!
Out of my sight!
Now it's your turn, raid leader!
General Boscone has been... No way.
The best Tudor warrior, defeated.
Damn bastard... he did it.
Bo... Boscone.
Don't panic!
We still have the advantage...
...everyone hold position.
How...
...that flag is...?
No... impossible.
Then, the castle...
No... that's insane!
You're so slow.
Your general has fallen, the fortress is ours.
Isn't it obvious?
You're finished!
Everyone!
Shout our victory and cry out loud!
Finally!
Kill the ones that offer resistance.
You cowards! Who told you to withdraw?
You'll be executed for desertion.
Get back in formation!
Do you disobey my orders?
Oi, traitors!
Come back! Come back here!
It's been a long time, Lord Gennon.
Oh... Griffith!
I've waited for this moment for so long.
Come... Let me have a look on your soft face.
As I expected, your beauty didn't fade at all.
What? Why do you remain silent?
Despite us being enemies...
...I can't forgot about that night together.
I've tried to find you ever since that moment.
Hey? Griffi...
Griffith.
What does this look mean?
Don't tell me... you hate me?
I have no such hatred against your Excellency.
I would say it is the opposite.
By taking advantage of sinful people like you...
...I could afford to maintain the Hawks...
...without putting them at risk in unnecessary battles.
You can boast yourself of being their savior.
Griffith... You...
As for the people who gave their lives for my dream...
...the least I could do was...
...to win and be victorious!
To achieve that, I would do anything.
You were only a rock on the path to my dream.
A mere tiny rock.
Son of a bitch...
Lord Griffith!
Long live the Hawks!
Defenders of Midland!
For all you've done, a million thanks!
Lord Griffith! Lord Griffith!
Impressive!
I would never have thought there were so many people.
Come here!
Oh, you're so bold sir Corkus!
Well... well...
Me too!
Miss Casca!
It's he assault troops.
And captain Guts!
The strongest Hawk!
It's wonderful.
Make them a sign, captain...
...you're the hero of this campaign after all!
Captain?
What's happening? You seem so distant.
Lately something seems to absorb your thoughts.
This is normal...
...I mean who would have predicted this 3 years ago?
True.
I want to build my own kingdom.
But this man.
Thank you.
This is really amazing!
All of them here!
Band of the Hawks' elite soldiers
Protectors of Midland.
Now we're famous, we'll have to pay
attention to our look!
Welcome, Lord Griffith!
I was so worried about you.
I prayed everyday for you.
Will you invite me to dance?
Please tell us about your battles as the Hawks leader!
A topic such as war brutalities would not
be an interesting story for ladies.
I bet it would!
Sound so exciting!
He's made for this.
He should save some for us!
Are you one of the Hawk's captain?
What?
We'd love to hear about your heroic battles!
You look so powerful.
Well... Of course!
Oh, please... Tell us all!
One night surely isn't enough to explain it all,
do you think you'll have more time?
Plenty, for sure.
Are you the raid leader?
We've heard you slaughtered a full battalion alone.
Really!
He's the one responsible for Boscone's fall.
Whoa, who's stronger? Lord Griffith or you?
His muscles are so big.
Ah... it's so hard.
Truly fascinating.
You're so cute! Are you from the Hawks too?
Hee... Yea... Indeed!
That's when I found myself with the terrific
General Boscone...

I need some air.
Help me, Guts!
Seriously... What a joke!
No, I am...
No one asked you yet?
It would strongly seem...
Ah... Such an exceptionnal woman as you
must have impressed them.
If that is so, would you grant me a dance?
No! Please be my partner for the next dance.
Well.
Wait please, I dedicated this song to you.
Please!
Well then, later?
Why are the nobles so boring?
Hey, do me a favor!
Those nobles over there won't let go of
me, please stay with me.
Cas...
Come on!
I'd feel better swinging my sword on the battlefield.
I agree.
I know nothing of this world, never had the chance...
...and it's been years since I last wore a robe.
I'm too muscular.
I'm ridiculous, I guess.
Not a bit
I'd even say you're beautiful.
Really?
Sure.
Why don't you ask Griffith for a dance?
I wouldn't know how to... and I'd probably
walk over his foot somehow.
But, tell me, what are you doing here?
Usually, you would have fled from such an event.
I wanted to see it with my own eyes.
What Griffith's Band of the Hawk fought for...
...and see how he would make his wish come true.
And there's something I must find as well.
Guts, what do you...
I can't keep on...
...being a part of his dream...
...living only for that purpose.
I want him to see me...
...as his equal.
Wait... Don't tell me you're...
All of you here, have endured atrocities of this now ended war!
From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.
As we all know, this victory is...
...mainly due to the skills of Lord Griffith's Hawks.
What they achieved with Doldrey was considered impossible
for the last century.
It is thanks to their great bravery...
...that they won this decisive battle.
I hereby grant Lord Griffith the highest
distinction of Midland's Army: the title of "White".
Also knighthood and a noble title for all of the Band, without exception.
Oh... White General.
White knights.
Impossible.
Those people... our equals?
I'm not dreaming.
We are... nobles now!
Long life to the Band of the Hawk!
Brrr... What a freezing breeze!
Guts, despite all our disagreements...
...we're brother in arms, why are you leaving?
The Band of the Hawk finally earned what we wanted.
Everything begins now.
So.
My decision is made.
But come on...
Guts.
Why are you leaving the Hawks?
Sorry.
Apologizing won't explain it!
The Band of the Hawk is our family.
Why do you wanna leave?
Why do you abandon us?
We're going to be nobles.
Our dream finally came true...
...what's wrong with you?
His will is set.
You must let him go.
But, but...
...don't you feel concerned at all?
Guts is vital to the Hawks!
Pff! If the Hawks are strong, that's not because of him.
But...
Cut the crap!
I'll take the opportunity to tell you this:
I never liked you...
...since the first day.
Today I finally understood why.
It's because of your fucking face...
...as if you were suffering everyone's pain alone.
Like you've been through things we would't understand.
But you're no exception here.
We have been through hell to come this far.
This guy is useless.
You want to spit on all this and leave?
To walk down a road of sorrow and pain?
Well, do as you please.
What do you want in the end?
Whatever you do, never will you be like Griffith.
Never ever!
Watch your back should we meet again on the battlefield.
Ah, what a relief!
Thanks guys for coming.
Wait, Guts...
I remember having told you that you're mine.
Why would that have changed?
You'll earn your freedom by the sword.
Griffith.
Can't we just say goodbye?
It appears not.
Wait, you really wanna fight again?
Griffith, just reason with him!
Casca, don't interfere.
Pippin! What are you doing, let go of me!
This fight can't be avoided.
He's going to lose an arm, that'll teach him a lesson.
What are you guys saying? We must stop them.
Did castle's life and nice robes make you forgot?
What's taken by the sword, can be earned back by the sword.
Isn't this the way of the mercenaries?
But...
But...
He stands for his dream...
...against anyone on the way...
...even if that person is me.
Do you really want it that much?
To get out of my hands?
Never. Never...
...will I allow such a thing!
Griffith!
Farewell.
Griffith.
Guts!
Guts...
You're wrong, no princess should frequent low people.
But Griffith earned his title with this war.
He has the highest grade of Midland's army.
He is still not to be officially invested until next month.
Come on Anna.
Princess, please discipline yourself.
If that is so, it'll take two months before I can see him.
I am alone while the world is at peace.
Who is it?
Lord Griffith!
My apologies.
How did you get here?
You will have trouble if someone find out you're here.
Please excuse my vulgar manners.
I shouldn't have behaved like this.
I'll leave.
I wanted to see you so much.
Since my Lord Griffith left for the campaign...
...I've lived in fear.
Worrying all the time...
...that one day bad news would come to my ear.
I prayed thousand times for your safety.
Seems that God listened to me.
I'm sorry for crying in front of you.
No.
Are you afraid?
No.
No, you have nothing to fear.
Whether it is sadness or happiness.
All will be engulfed in flames.
The storm is growing bigger.
Have you seen Griffith?
No, not since this morning, with Guts.
I see.
Farewell...
Farewell.
Well, look at who we've found here!
Wouldn't he be Midland's army first general?
What could you be doing here so early?
You must know that this is no place for someone like you.
Depending on what kind of incident it involves...
...you might be condemned for high treason to the crown.
Seize him!
What was on Griffith's mind?
To all of a sudden want to meet here?
Military maneuvers? How the hell would I know?
Then why without equipment?
Maybe he wanted us to go for a picnic.
Since Tudor fell...
...we haven't really fought.
Maybe he just wants to assemble the army for some reason.
He didn't came back yesterday night.
It must have been a shock to Griffith.
Bullshit, Griffith wouldn't give it up to such a loser.
But...
You should shut up!
The guy chose to leave, if something happens to him,
well, he deserves it.
Griffith is a war hero.
He's not dumb enough to let something like that overwhelm him.
But...
But... But...
Enough!
From now on, you just keep your mouth closed!
Stop acting like a stupid, stubborn child!
I wonder what is taking Griffith so long.
Enemy ambush!!!
They attack us from behind?
Are those Tudor's remaining troops?
No... wait.
This is...
Midland's army!
Really... abject, you dirty bastard!
I gave you protection, promoted to the highest rank!
And that still didn't satisfy your ambition!
Be cursed! You and your band will go to Hell!
I understand now... It was curious indeed.
During wartime, political weddings are common.
Yet, rumor said that Charlotte wasn't promised
to such a plan... and she never would be.
Wh... What are you insinuating?
Would you like to kiss Princess Charlotte?
Or rather... Would you like to make love to her?
Shut the fuck up!
Damn, why are they attacking us without any reason!?
Hey! What's happening exactly!?
Griffith, where are you!?
We should split to avoid the arrows!
Wait! Corkus!
We can't just scatter.
A lone rider won't stand a chance to go through their lines.
All in battle formation!
Don't let them surround us in one place.
Everyone, prepare to charge!
Charge!
Griffith...
Torturer!
Yes!
You can do whatever you want to him, show no mercy.
He's a sinner, and a traitor to Midland.
Are... are you sure?
Make sure you keep him living...
...as he severely sinned...
...I want him live long enough to regret.
Yes
The Hawk is now broken on the ground, he will never fly again.
You really are something.
Despite all those tortures, you don't even moan.
Makes me shiver.
Ha? What's that?
Seem nice! Mine!
Ahh, poor me...
...it fell.
