Is Godzilla your favorite?
He's a superman!
Come on, Ken, time for lunch.
Okay.
Darling.
Darling!
Good afternoon.
Oh, good afternoon. Got something
interesting for my husband?
Some kind of strange fish
that looks very weird to me.
Well, professor,
what kind of fish is it?
It's a tadpole, isn't it?
It's much too big to be a tadpole.
Anyway, they don't live in the sea.
Oh, yeah.
Where did you catch this?
Down on the point,
where I usually get the shrimp.
I didn't catch a single one today.
With the fish getting worse every day,
Suruga Bay is done for.
What in the world
is this monster...
... that appeared at the accident site
in Suruga Bay?
Could it be some kind
of sea monster...
... or was it some kind
of new military weapon?
Whatever it was...
... it has enough frightful power
to destroy two ships,
Oh, that was a monster tadpole.
Papa, it's the same fish
the old fisherman brought here today.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- That'll be 2:00.
- Right.
Now, set your watch. Bye.
Man, it's empty.
Papa! The tadpole! Papa!
Papa. Papa...
Papa. Please come back, Papa.
Ouch!
Papa!
Papa!
The monster that attacked you
was smaller than the one...
...that sunk the tanker.
- Right.
There isn't just one Hedorah.
They come in different sizes,
right, Papa?
Hedorah?
That's just a name
my son dreamed up for them.
They come from the sludge.
Sludge? Professor, is it possible
that's the reason?
Well, maybe. I'm not sure.
It's too early to say.
Excuse us.
Oh, no. No pictures, please.
Yes, I want pictures taken.
I want people to see this
on the television.
They need to realize
how big the threat is.
Go ahead.
Hedorah got me too.
Since the first tragedy in Suruga Bay,
other tankers...
... have been involved
in similar accidents,
The survivors tell us...
... that in each instance,
they saw a dark-colored monster,
This could be the work of Hedorah,
Cheerful
The atomic bomb,
the hydrogen bomb...
... cast their fallout into the sea,
Poison gases, sludge,
Everyone throws them into the sea,
Even sewage,
Godzilla would really get angry
if he saw this,
He would do something,
Class A, second grade, Ken Yano,
Oh, darling,
what are you doing up so late?
I put some muddy water
in one of those test tubes.
Stop this.
You should be resting.
This the strangest thing
I've ever seen.
This so-called fish
is actually a mineral.
It's the same as diamonds
and other crystallized carbons.
Papa.
Ken, what are you doing up?
Don't you know how late it is?
Papa, Godzilla's coming to save us.
Godzilla?
He's gonna come and kill Hedorah!
I saw it happen in my dream.
He'll come, won't he?
Mama, what do you think?
If you saw it in your dream,
I'm sure he'll come.
Now it's time to go back to bed.
Papa.
I understand now.
This water is just muddy water.
Hedorah comes to life
in polluted water, just like you thought.
Cool! Look, Mama.
Now, these will join together too.
No wonder it can grow so quickly.
They combine
when they meet each other.
So the Hedorah I saw,
and the one that sank the tankers...
...grew big this way.
This means they can reach
an enormous size.
- Bigger than Godzilla?
- Yep...
...as long as we keep feeding
the ocean with sludge.
If this thing came up on land,
it would be a disaster!
But would a tadpole be able
to come up on land?
You never know.
This is a new and unusual mutation.
We have to do something
before it's too late.
Did you say Hedorah?
Knock it off!
Hedorah is a sea monster.
It's Godzilla! Let's take a closer look.
Why is Godzilla here?
If the two monsters start fighting,
they'll destroy the entire port.
Thirty-five people are dead
and 81 have been injured...
... in the fight, on land,
between Hedorah and Godzilla,
Three hundred and twenty-two
buildings have been lost,
In areas that Hedorah
passed through...
... metal objects have been completely
corroded as if by some form of acid,
Is this terrestrial Hedorah the same
monster that sank the tankers?
Where did Hedorah come from?
Why was Godzilla here?
There are still many
unanswered questions...
... regarding this strange event,
He doesn't know anything.
Godzilla came to beat Hedorah.
Right, Papa?
You know everything,
don't you, Ken?
Is that your Godzilla impression?
- Brother, are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yukio seems to think
you can be of some help.
Well, I might be able to find out
what Hedorah really is...
...with the help of Yukio and Miki.
Is this where you saw the sparks?
Yeah, that's right.
Papa.
This is it. It's burnt.
It's ash from the sparks.
- You want me to pick them up?
- All that you can find.
It's exactly like the tadpole.
So it came onto land
after it changed...
...like a frog does.
That may be the case...
...but is it possible
for a living organism...
...to be made up of minerals?
You're sure you saw sparks
coming from it?
Yes, without a doubt.
It was very beautiful.
And it didn't eat the cat it captured...
...but inhaled smoke
from the smokestacks instead.
That smoke should be toxic
to any living animal.
I know.
Hedorah is completely different
from all other life on Earth.
The colored, gooey stuff
is waste material.
The white, shiny stuff
is the crystallized carbon.
It's a mineral called hedrium.
What you see there is the eyeball
of the tadpole ground into powder.
I gave it the name hedrium...
...and I think that is the key
to the life force of the monster.
If its body is formed by minerals
and waste material...
...it wouldn't have a nerve structure
as we know it.
It wouldn't be unusual for it to spark
if Godzilla breathed fire on it.
If Hedorah lived off of our smoke...
...wouldn't that end
our air-pollution problem?
Don't be ridiculous.
Hedorah is much more dangerous.
Why did all that metal corrode?
Take another look.
That yellow substance
you see there...
...that's sulfur.
The hedrium is probably a catalyst...
...that produces sulfur
when it reacts with other substances.
Sulfur is a component
of sulfuric acid.
The burns on my face...
...are very similar to burns
caused by sulfuric acid.
The small particles
in sulfuric acid...
...create a sulfuric mist
that corrodes metal.
If Hedorah consumes our smoke
and releases a sulfuric mist...
...it wouldn't clean our air.
We'll be enveloped
in a poisonous smog.
The appearance of Hedorah, believed
to have formed in polluted bays...
... has placed the entire country
in a state of terror,
Hedorah appears to avoid daylight...
... but the threat of another landing
remains on rainy or foggy days,
Residents within one kilometer...
... of rivers or the ocean
should stay on alert,
Especially along
industrial coastlines...
... where pollution is a problem...
Forget all this Hedorah talk
until you get better.
Fine.
I was just watching the news.
Papa, if Hedorah isn't from this
planet, then how did it get here?
Ken, do you know what a meteor is?
M 82 Nebula which has exploded
- A shooting star that falls to Earth,
- That's right,
Hedorah must have been
on a rock that landed on Earth,
I wonder what kind of planet
it came from,
It probably came from
a sticky, dark planet far, far away,
Now, let's go to sleep,
- Stop! Stop!
- Careful!
Be careful!
I saw Godzilla.
Hedorah must be here too!
Hedorah wouldn't come
on a nice day like this.
Ken!
He's so hard to keep up with.
Yes.
- What? Godzilla?
- It's true!
Right, go to your mother's school
and come home together.
Ken?
What's wrong? Ken!
Hello? Hello?
One, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven, eight.
Teacher! My throat!
What was it? Girls! Michiko!
Quickly, come along, girls.
We must go inside. Hurry!
Everyone, help each other.
Gas tanks at the
Japan Oil Company have exploded,
Residents in the area,
evacuate immediately,
The fire may spread,
Residents,
please evacuate immediately,
- It'd be faster to walk.
- Now, don't get impatient.
Something wrong?
I don't know.
What is that?!
Run for it!
Ouch!
Anti-Hedorah Oxygen Masks
Now on Sale
The southwestern area of Fuji City
has virtually been destroyed.
So far, 1600 people
have been killed...
...while the number of people injured
exceeds 30,000.
Hedorah has left a trail of
very high levels of sulfuric mist...
...ranging from 2000 ppm
to 2800 ppm...
...affecting rescue workers'
eyes and throats.
Dead bodies are reportedly
piling up in the streets.
It was so frightening
when the students started collapsing.
That's no learning environment.
If this continues,
there's no telling how bad it will get.
Will Hedorah just get bigger
and bigger, Papa?
If we don't get rid of the pollution,
he'll just keep growing.
As it gets bigger...
...it'll absorb more pollutants
into itself...
...and it'll be able to go anywhere.
Will it climb Mount Fuji?
It might.
Ken, do you know
what a nuclear explosion is?
- The atomic and hydrogen bombs.
- Yes.
Atomic nucleus
When the atoms of a substance
undergo nuclear fission...
Neutron
... they create different atoms and emit
a tremendous amount of energy,
The Nuclear Explosion
of an Atom of Silver
In space, there are explosions...
... much bigger than atomic bombs,
even bigger than the sun,
Bang! That's wild.
Hedorah is probably flying by means
of its own nuclear power.
After all, it is a space creature
made up of metal components.
There's no telling what kind of
destructive power it may develop.
Could it become more powerful
than Godzilla?
It's possible.
But, you see,
there's only one Hedorah.
If everyone pulls together,
we can defeat it.
Can't we do something?
The next time the monster lands...
...we must have something ready
to destroy it.
It has to have a weakness.
Why don't we dry it?
It's only sludge.
Hedorah has won after all.
Everything produces waste.
We humans created Hedorah
with ours.
Down with Environmental Pollution!
The March of One Million People
Sponsored by All-Japan
Youth Federation
A million people...
...on the go.
How about that?
We'll get all the young people.
Then we'll throw a huge party
on top of Mount Fuji...
...before Hedorah gets to it.
1. Aquatic Phase
When Hedorah first appeared,
it looked like a huge tadpole...
...sinking tankers left and right.
This is its aquatic phase.
2. Terrestrial Phase
On a foggy night, it transformed into
a creature like a four-legged reptile...
...absorbing smoke from
smokestacks, growing steadily.
This was its terrestrial stage.
3. Airborne Phase
It transformed
into a saucer-like flier...
...and spread large amounts
of sulfuric mist...
...over the city in broad daylight.
This is its airborne phase.
The question now is:
What terrifying form
will the monster take next?
Professor, what do you think?
Its growth rate is frightening.
I have no idea what it will do.
Then what is Hedorah's weakness?
Well, you see...
...Hedorah lives in a world in which
no earthly creature can exist.
A negative world of death.
That is to say, it lives in sludge
and polluted air.
So it's possible that oxygen
might deter its growth.
- Give them oxygen! That'll do it!
- Yeah!
Who gave birth to Hedorah?
Neither the land nor the sea
is suitable for life,
What will Hedorah do next?
Oh, thank you.
One positive electrode
and one negative.
Feed the electric current and anything
between them dries instantly.
It's been tested in Hokkaido
as a way to dry out the fields.
Well, let's try it.
- You'll use this to dry out Hedorah?
- That's right.
Good. We just need to increase
the size of the model.
Call the Self-Defense Force.
Orders have been given
for the entire Self-Defense Force...
... including the reserve forces,
to guard the main industrial cities,
The government issued orders
for all factories to cease production...
... and placed restrictions
on movement of vehicles,
Over 10 million people in Tokyo,
Osaka and other large cities...
... are suffering from the effects
of the sulfuric mist,
I thought a million people
were coming. There's only 100.
Why complain about it?
Green pastures exist
only in our hearts now.
Let's sing. Let's dance!
Let's at least use our energy
to make a stand!
All right, let's do it!
It is 5;40 p, m,
This is a special news bulletin,
Hedorah has made a landing
and is heading north,
It seems to have grown to a size
of at least 60 meters long,
Self-Defense Forces along the coast
have fired at Hedorah...
... but the bullets shot straight
through it with no effect...
- ... as it continues in its destruction,
- Toshi!
Toshi!
Darling!
Make a phone call for me.
I can sense it. Godzilla is here.
- That means Hedorah is here too.
- Are you sure?
Good, it's Godzilla! He's here!
Get him, Godzilla!
Hello, Self-Defense headquarters?
The electrodes. Have you finished
making the electrodes?
What?
You're constructing it in Sakaigawa?
Hedorah's in the Mount Fuji area?
Please do your best.
Ken is in danger.
He's not the only one.
Every living thing is in danger.
Toshi, we must go to Mount Fuji.
You're in no condition to travel.
If the electrodes fail...
...there's no way
of stopping Hedorah.
The survival of this planet
depends on those electrodes.
Look!
The fire. Get your torches!
Drop the oxygen!
Here we are. Are you all right?
Professor, the electrodes
are ready.
Good.
We've set up the electrodes
one kilometer apart.
They are 40 meters tall
and 60 meters wide.
How do you plan on getting Hedorah
to come between the electrodes?
We bait it with artillery
and helicopters.
When it's close,
we'll use blinking headlights...
...and supersonic waves.
- What's the voltage?
- Three million volts.
We're rerouting all the electricity
from the Kanto and Chubu areas here.
The power lines are down!
Repair them immediately!
Headquarters! Temporarily stop
current transmission!
Unit one! Unit one, report!
- We've lost contact.
- What about unit two?
- It's on its way, sir.
- Hurry!
It's coming.
The headlights. Use the headlights.
You've got to get its attention.
But we still don't have power.
If you don't use them,
it'll leave here.
- Hurry!
- Please do as he says.
Hey, blink the lights!
- Aren't the repairs done yet?
- Almost.
- When will you be finished?
- In about 10 more minutes.
How close to us is it now?
About 100 meters.
It's stopped.
Stupid bastard!
It's coming.
- Is it ready yet?
- Another five minutes.
We don't have time!
You've got one minute.
- You've got 30 seconds!
- Okay!
Is it ready? Do we have any power?
Hurry, we need the power now!
- We've got full power now!
- You damn fool! It's too late!
Hey, they're coming right for us.
All right, turn it on!
Open circuits!
- Now what?
- I think we blew a fuse. It's no good.
Why can't anything be done right?
Godzilla!
Godzilla!
Godzilla, goodbye!
