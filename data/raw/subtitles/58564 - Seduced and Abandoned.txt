What are you studying?
Pascoli, the poet...
"Alone, alone and hungry
for a steep hill,
breaking the suffering
hands and feet."
"Crying, yes, perhaps,
but softly..."
Where's Consolata?
She went out...
... with the laundry.
Agnese, why are you afraid?
What are making me do?
Come here... be quiet.
-Wicked girl, you gave in!
-l'm ashamed, l disgust myself.
When you did it,
you didn't feel disgust, eh?
Yes, right after, Father.
That's too late,
you're disgraceful!
What can l do?
-Don't see him again!
-How?
He's always at my house.
When l see him, l melt.
Don't look at him!
l try, but l can't stop.
For shame!
You must defeat the demon!
You must pray.
Punish your flesh.
Pray! Pray! Pray!
You're pale. Are you ill?
-No.
-l'll carry your books.
"Today was also a day of
instruction on taking orders.
Mounting and dismantling
of the carbine.
l did very well in ability."
"So, l got special rations:
rigatoni in tomato sauce
and fig marmalade,
which always gives me
the usual reaction
with a lot of itching
that won't let me sleep.
l used that time to think
a lot about you."
Your fiancé is a man
of letters! A poetic soul!
What nonsense!
Here, you can read it.
Just a moment...
"Passionate kisses
to your lips."
You will tell him
to write these obscenities
to his sister!
One more subterfuge and
his letters will go in the toilet!
-Vincenzo...
-Shut up!
Pansy hand!
-Consolata, the door.
-Yes...
l'll go. lt's Peppino.
-Good evening, Matilde.
-Good evening.
How elegant you are!
l permitted myself
to offer a small gift.
Chocolates!
Matilde, open them!
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.
Offer a liquor to your fiancé.
lt's the new liquor.
lt turned out well this year,
it fermented last here.
Agnese!
What is it, foolish girl?
Pardon, l don't feel well.
-What's wrong with her?
-She's strange.
-Maybe she studies too much.
-She talks at night.
-ln her sleep?
-What does she say?
-What does she say?
-She mumbles.
What nonsense is this?
Maybe she's ill.
Tomorrow l'll give her
lettuce water.
l don't want to...
Be brave.
lf you're afraid,
you're taken by the demon.
-Any news from Rome?
-Not yet.
l applied for the test
over a month ago.
l'm waiting for news.
You have to be very tough.
The job is competitive.
My sponsor has
my uncle's support,
Monsignor Regalbuto.
We'll have my cousin,
the lawyer intervene
he's a friend of
Judge Randazzo's brother.
He wasn't able to reform me!
ldiot!
Grandpa, be good.
Milk chocolate!
Only one for your sister!
l feel better.
The idea of living in Rome,
far from Mama and Papa,
scares me.
You'll get used to it...
No, thanks.
Have one.
Peppino brought them.
-Have one.
-Just one.
Pick them up.
That one too... stop that!
Go!!
This is crazy!
Peppino has to leave.
Already? Not because of...
No, l have to study some
chapters on legal medicine.
-May l go with him?
-Yes.
The glass!
3 minutes!
Consolata, the coffee!
Peppino, do you love me?
Very much, but l have to go.
Not even one minute
has passed!
l know, but studying
makes me nervous.
l have a headache and l'll
be up all night with books.
l'll read in bed too.
l'll feel closer to you.
-Will you come tomorrow?
-Maybe the day after.
-l have to study...
-Don't wear yourself out!
l need steel nerves!
l made a mistake. Agnese
won't talk, she's not crazy!
Crazy... what if she's crazy?
My God! You could at least
believe in prayer!
Who are you?
Don't you answer?
You're a villain!
Who are you speaking to?
l'm studying out loud!
You haven't come out
for days!
Take a rest!
Come out for some air!
You make me sick!
Mama, will you lend me
5000 lire?
Hold me back!
Are they the ones
from last month?
The first one
doesn't look familiar.
They've changed locomotives,
but the cabooses are the same!
And what a caboose!
A doctor maintains that a man,
in his entire lifetime,
has about 3,000 loads to shoot.
-Not bad, eh?
-That doctor was a fool.
We've reserved three rooms.
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.
Ladies...
may we offer you a drink?
Thank you.
-After they've freshened up.
-Of course.
-See you later!
-See you later.
l said this doctor is a fool.
Why is that?
A man shoots one everyday,
from 18 through 60 years old.
lf mathematics
is not an opinion...
-Did they get here yet?
-Yes.
-Peppino!
-He's not here yet!
Who?
Doctor Schiavone
was supposed to tutor me
to prepare for the job test.
There are 12 positions,
not 10.
My possibilities
have increased.
Good! Why don't we see you
at the house anymore?
l told Matilde l was studying
for the examination.
16 hours of study a day.
ln fact, l'm going home now.
lf Doctor Schiavone comes,
tell him l'll come back.
My respects, Don Vincenzo.
Anyway...
if mathematics is not just
an opinion, 60 - 18 = 42.
42 times 365 equals...
-What are you doing, girls?
-We're in the bathroom!
You're alway in there!
Agnese!
-l'm here.
-Embroider, Agnese, work...
-Rosaura!
-l'm coming!
Come on, get to work...
Matilde, when will your
trousseau be finished?
l can't find Peppino's
photograph.
His student photo.
Careful, you'll stain the sheet.
-l don't feel well.
-You're pale.
-She's pale, isn't she, girls?
-Yes, a bit.
-She's white.
-She's almost green.
You're not eating. Do you
want a scrambled egg?
No, leave me alone.
Force yourself.
Look at your sisters.
Matilde is nice and fat.
-You look like a spider!
-ls that my fault?
Peppino hasn't been here
for a week.
He has to study,
for your big event.
He could come and visit
now and then!
What's wrong with Agnese?
Go and see.
She prays at night.
She twists in her bed
all night.
She's locked inside.
"l don't want Matilde
to suffer because of me.
Please, come back, Peppino,
l know l'll never tell...
the secret of my guilt
which was to give in to lust.
Don't pay attention if this
letter is wet with my tears."
Agnese?
What are you doing?
l'm coming, Mama!
-What were you doing?
-l had an upset stomach.
"... of my guilt which
was to give in to lust..."
Rosaura, on the 20th,
Matilde, the 25th,
Agnese, the 27th.
What day is today?
July 31.
Do you need anything?
Vincenzo...
Do you know
what "lust" means?
"Give in to lust"
At this hour?
Those are the words
Agnese wrote.
-To who?
-l don't know.
l'm worried about that girl.
What is she doing?
Penitence?
lt took 3 hours by car!
lsn't there a midwife here?
ls she ready?
l spent 3000 lire on petrol.
Annina...
lt's nothing.
-What do you want?
-Close the door!
What are you doing to me?
You, get inside!
She's a girl, sooner or
later it had to happen.
-Who was it?
-lt's not true!
Who was it?
-l didn't do anything!
-Stop, Vincenzo!
She could be pregnant!
The midwife doesn't know,
she has to be tested.
Stop!
Examine all three of them!
They're my wife's.
-Urine samples?
-Yes, from my wife.
General analysis?
To confirm a possible
pregnancy.
-Your name?
-What?
-Your name?
-Pisciotta.
-lt will take a few days.
-That long?
Judge Randazzo's
brother's lawyer
is my cousin.
That changes things
Sit down, we'll do it now.
We'll have the answer fast
with an immunological test.
lt's like a telegram.
Mr. Pisciotta!
lt's okay,
the test was positive.
Congratulations to you
and your wife.
Who was it? Where? When?
She's never alone.
Maybe at school?
No! Then the family friends.
Maybe the doctor?
lmpossible. Father Mariano?
Where? At home?
Peppino? No! Antonio?
What am l saying?
Who is it?
-Where is Peppino?
-l don't know.
Maybe he went home.
l fell asleep.
That dog!
Quiet, bitch, be quiet!
-Peppino!
-lt's not true!
Don't deny it!
lt was Peppino!
-No!
-Shut up! l'll kill him!
No, l'll kill myself!
l'll become a nun!
Whore!
You'll never leave
here again!
Let her out only
to go to the bathroom!
You're asleep,
that's all you do!
lt wasn't him!
lt was a policeman
who was passing through.
lt wasn't him!
lgnazia, the door!
Write! "Matilde..."
-Have you gone crazy?
-What has happened to her?
He made her pregnant,
a double traitor!
lf you don't marry her,
l'll stab you!
l'm a father too.
Calm down.
-We'll fix things.
-ln 15 days at the most!
-Write it!
-Poor Matilde!
She will be compromised
in front of everyone!
l'll take care of Matilde.
Write!
"Matilde,
l'm taking back
my promise of marriage."
Why?
All of a sudden,
and with no explanation!
"Don't ask me the reason
for my decision."
-Why?
-Calm down.
lf Agnese was shamed what
does that have to do with me?
Calm down, Matilde.
Compromised in front
of everyone!
l'll never be able to leave
the house again!
Calm down, your father won't
let you die an old maid.
lt's all that
disgusting girl's fault!
lt's all your fault!
You shamed yourself
with a policeman!
-Where's the Baron?
-lnside.
-The Baron's hanging himself!
-Run!
-Baron!
-Who is it?
-May l?
-Wait!
l'm coming!
-One moment!
-Am l disturbing you?
Just a second!
You look well.
Excuse me...
but l was passing by...
You know how it is...
l said to myself:
l'll go and say hello
to the Baron!
lt's big, isn't it?
Very spacious!
lt's all that l have left
of the building.
lt's been rented room by room
like a 4th class hotel.
-This is the last refuge.
-l've embarrassed your dignity.
Dignity appears above all
in indigence.
Please, let's go to
the antechamber.
After all...
l can still say l have
running water and a chair
for my guests.
lf l may ask...
how did it happen?
l inherited holes in my
pocket from my father.
Your father was the very
respected Baron Liprando.
l remember him
with loving devotion.
He was the one that loaned
me the money for the mine
and l gave it back to him
right on time.
lt was in 1930.
You were a baby.
Do you see his portrait?
lt was there.
That's the last thing l sold.
My father was ugly,
but the portrait was valuable.
He wasn't so ugly.
He one eye that looked left
and the other, right.
He was kind.
When he met my children
coming from Mass
he gave them sweets,
candies, ice cream...
Do you remember?
Rosaura, Annina, Matilde...
This is Matilde, Rosaura,
Annina, and that's Antonio.
You're a lucky father,
with so many flowers...
That's to the florist's merit.
Matilde, do the honors.
Have a seat.
-Who is that?
-The Baron.
-Who's here?
-The Baron.
Why is he here?
l may be wrong, but he's
Matilde's new fiancé.
Poor Matilde!
Peppino was better!
But, if Matilde marries
the Baron...
-What?
-Nothing.
You're beautiful!
What a heavenly aroma!
There's fennel in it!
-Sublime!
-Pardon if we began
with such a heavy dish.
-lt was a great idea!
-lt was my husband's idea.
He said, make a hearty
dish for him because...
Matilde made the pasta.
My compliments!
l prefer pasta...
like ziti and fusilli.
You're an expert!
Just a sympathizer.
What comes after this?
Seeing as today
is Saint John's Day...
"Babalucci", rhum baba!
Did l guess?
How did you guess?
From the perfume in the air.
"Babalucci to eat,
kiss a girl so sweet,
satisfaction a thing
you'll never meet!"
Nice, isn't he?
A gentlemen.
Too bad about his teeth!
What a surprising effect!
-They look well together.
-Yes.
We can tell Matilde
the whole truth now.
Not yet... because of his teeth.
He's missing three.
-You can see that?
-And smell it too. Bad breath.
-l'll speak to him about it.
-With the necessary tact.
Let's leave the women
to themselves.
Let's have ourselves
a little chat.
What dentist do you go to?
You can see. l know.
When l laugh, you can see.
lt's a shame, you're young.
At my age,
they don't grow back.
-They don't grow back.
-lt can be fixed.
Doctor Paternò is
the best dentist
-in the province.
-Unfortunately, l...
-l'll speak to him.
-That's too much trouble.
Go on, Matilde.
Don Orlando,
remember that appointment.
Yes...
-lt's our turn.
-Don't worry.
-Where is Peppino?
-He's sick.
Sick? He's wearing horns!
l don't want Agnese.
l want a virgin wife.
l have a right!
You heard Don Vincenzo!
Answer me!
Would you have
married Mama...
if she had behaved
like Agnese?
-What are you talking about?
-Well, you tried!
The man must ask,
the woman must refuse.
Exactly! Agnese didn't refuse.
l don't want to marry a whore!
l'm obligated to Don Vincenzo!
Answer the question.
lf l had given in
would you have married me?
Absolutely not!
Move that cart!
Nino, when is the explosion?
Carmelo!
Are you doing it up there?
lf Califano doesn't show
today,
l'll show him!
That's Father Mariano!
Father Mariano!
-Why are you here?
-Ascalone!
-How are you?
-Fine
l'm not here by chance,
but for something heavy
on my heart.
-Have you guessed?
-Maybe,
but you should tell me.
Amalia came to see me.
She told me everything.
Mrs. Amalia Califano
is an intelligent woman.
She's friendly, religious
and very prudent.
Matrimony is not the way
to repair a mistake.
-Yes, l know...
-There was a mistake,
but to repair it, you mustn't
make a larger one
by celebrating a marriage
with no guarantee
of a union,
of solidity and affection.
l agree..
What guarantee is there
of the education
of the children?
Peppino Califano
is a scoundrel,
but for the Church, he isn't
obligated to marry Agnese.
He's not obligated...
according to the Church?
-We have an agreement.
-That's Amalia's opinion.
and Peppino's too.
Dirty rotten dogs!
Don Vincenzo, calm down!
Where are you going?
-ls anyone here?
-Nobody's home.
l washed the floor!
Don Vincenzo,
no one is home!
-Where are they?
-l don't know.
Brass, underline
that third phrase!
Start again!
-Where is your son?
-He had to leave.
lt was my wife's idea,
l wasn't involved.
Not involved?
Are you a man or a puppet?
You gave me your word!
What happened?
Nothing happened.
-A misunderstanding.
-Reparable, l hope.
Very reparable.
lt's not my fault
that Peppino ran off!
-Shut up!!
-Quiet, the Baron is here.
Wake up!
Excuse me, Don Vincenzo,
the dentist took a mold,
but he didn't give me
any estimate yet.
Don't worry about it.
Here, l put in a change
of socks.
and the cheese our cousin
likes so much!
You're disgusting!
l hope you die
among serpents!
Come in, cousin.
ls everything well at home?
-Francesca, Antonio...?
-Yes, everything's fine.
That makes me happy.
Why did you come here?
-ls it serious?
-Yes.
-Tumor?
-Honor.
Eat and drink,
those of you who can.
l'm an unhappy woman. My
gall bladder has me swollen.
l can't sleep at night. You're
lucky to be young and happy.
Now the reumatism will
come back in the winter
and my heart is in bad shape.
The doctor says
it's my blood pressure.
l'm constipated,
what can l do for you?
My friend told me
to take lndia root.
Vincenzo, is lndia root
good for me?
-Who knows?
-Carmela, close the door!
We'll send Peppino
a registered letter.
lf he doesn't show up
in 24 hours,
we'll press charges
based on article 530:
"Corruption of a minor".
lf he marries her
he won't go to jail.
Article 544...
But he knows
you'll never do that
becaus you don't
want everyone
to know the truth.
-No, never!
-Right.
-So?
-l'll kill him!
You'll get 20 years.
lf you'd have killed him
at the moment it happened,
under the influence of anger
for the offense to your honor,
the sentence would have
been 3 or 7 years.
lt's still valid
in a state of anger
lt's too late now.
The fight with Califano
will get you accused.
Premeditation.
20 years.
Unless revenge is taken
by another family member
who discovers this offense
to your honor.
He goes and kills him!
Who could it be?
Let's count out
Francesca and your father.
Obviously
count out Agnese,
because she can't
find out now
she's been dishonored.
Therefore, a name
jumps right at our eyes!
Antonio!
Me?!
l was talking to him...
and he suddenly
got a lump on his nose.
He got a fever
and he passed out.
104! lt's rare,
but it can happen.
l had a patient
like that once in Naples.
lt was called
"Bombardment shock".
He needs a purgative.
Can't you give him a more
energetic medicine?
-Some penicillin?
-Why not?
Penicillin, a million units.
-Not two million?
-Alright.
-Two million...
-The purgative!
Don Vincenzo, to what
do l owe the pleasure?
Or displeasure?
Don't worry, everything
is fine at my house.
What can l do for you?
Peppino Califano...
Where is he?
Life is hard these days.
lt's difficult to believe
that people are good.
l'm perfecting
an electric guitar
with a portable battery
for serenading.
But who does that today?
Today a fiancé
sends a record.
And does anyone care
for making death decorous?
Today, the rich buy
refrigerators, televisions,
but they choose caskets
made of common wood.
Business is difficult.
l have to be everyone's friend.
You know how the people
in this town are.
He could receive
an anonymous letter.
This is for the stamps.
"He whom you seek is hidden
with his uncle in Regalbuto.
An anonymous friend but
always at your command".
This is a gun license,
it's irreprehensible.
You always carry the gun
with you,
because of the worker's pay,
etc...
Get close to Peppino
and give him an ultimatum:
"lt'd be better for everyone
if you marry my sister".
lf he objects...
empty the gun!
The coffee!
-Thank you.
-Sugar?
We'll do it.
Empty the whole cartridge
but make it so only one
is the fatal hit.
You were blinded by rage
when you shot
and that shot will have been
the fatal one.
That's what l need in court!
My cousin guarantees you
a maximum of five years.
Let's go, the train
might be on time.
Excuse me,
l'll be right back.
l'm in here.
Matilde, it's me.
ln all sincerity...
do you still love Peppino?
-What?
-lf Peppino died,
would you be sorry?
lf Peppino died...
and your brother
went to jail?
How should l interpret
your silence?
Are you silently approving?
Are you being funny?
That's in very bad taste!
Why does Peppino
have to die?
-Antonio!
-l'm coming!
Would you be sorry
if Peppino died?
Peppino is with his uncle,
the priest, in Regalbuto.
l wouldn't want to kill
a man you loved!
-Agnese!
-That disgusting scoundrel!
What did you say?
-Antonio!!
-l'm coming!
-What is it?
-l have to use the bathroom.
Consolata!
Open the door...
-What are you doing here?
-Me? Nothing.
Come in.
Open the door!
What did you want
to tell me?
Nothing.
Aren't you Don Vincenzo
Ascalone's daughter?
-Yes.
-Annina?
-l'm Agnese.
-Sit down!
You sit too.
Well, what happened?
They want to kill him.
Explain that.
-l can't.
-Call her father.
My brother wants to kill
Peppino Califano
-Where?
-He's hiding
in St. Giuliano convent
in Regalbuto.
Antonio left 5 minutes ago
on the train.
Then there's time.
Why does your brother
want to kill him?
Wasn't he engaged to your
sister? Didn't she leave him?
He should be the one
to be offended.
Why does Antonio
want to kill him?
Peppino is a coward!
Listen, little girl...
why do you want
to save him
and then call him a coward?
Was there something
between you?
What are you writing?
She says no and
you're writing no?
We're in Sicily. She said no
and maybe she means yes.
l say there was something
between you and Califano.
-No, l swear!
-Call her father.
No, please!
-lt's like you said.
-As l was saying.
Write.
-How old are you?
-Almost 16.
A minor! You'll have to sign.
Read it back.
"Are you Annina?" She answers
the question: "No, l'm Agnese!".
Get up! Go get the car ready!
-Where are we going?
-We're looking for the convent.
-Turn.
-Let's ask them.
-Turn.
-lt's faster if we ask.
Please, where is
St. Giuliano convent?
The convent?
They're not answering.
They're not answering!
Go...
Peppino, where are you going?
Stop! Excuse me, Father
Stop, you coward!
l order you to stop!
l'll shoot!
-Criminal!
-Peppino!
You're here? Why is that?
Whore! Bastard child! Spy!
Be quiet, for goodness sakes!
lt's nothing...
Calm down, cousin.
-Calm down.
-Assassins!
-Speak up!
-No...
Don't speak at all,
that's better.
l agree with my colleague.
Let's put aside rancor,
don't let anything out.
-Nothing happened!
-You have only one enemy,
he's in there!
ls that clear?
-Let them in.
-Okay.
-Good day, Your Honor.
-Put out the cigarette!
According to your sister,
you want to kill
Giuseppe Califano.
Me? Agnese...
-Have you gone crazy?
-Sit down!
Your Honor, l swear!
May l drop dead!
Magnificent!
He's denying it all!
-Now it's Peppino's turn.
-Let me watch now!
You escaped and were
followed by Ascalone.
l didn't escape,
l was running.
-l was running too.
-They ran.
To the garden.
-And the gun?
-Did l have that?
There was a gun,
but it was on the ground.
Whose is it?
l don't know.
Why would l kill Peppino?
We're the best of friends.
l'll tell you the motive!
The charge of corrupting
a minor!
He wants to dirty the honor
of my family!
My daughter's virginity
is unquestionable.
That document is not valid.
l'll press defamation charges.
Control yourselves,
we are in a seat of justice.
There are too many of us!
lf you value your life,
you won't say a word!
Threatening a public official.
Shall l arrest him?
Let's not dramatize!
Your Honor, we are not
millionaires or barons.
The only wealth we have
is our honored name!
We are bound
by court secrecy
l want calm and respect!
Please, go outside.
Let them stay.
Let's simplify matters.
Go sit with the others.
-Sit down.
-ln silence, please!
Let's try to simplify this...
Sit down, Agnese.
Do you confirm the charges?
She was bragging.
She's a little girl.
lt was a trick.
Tell him.
She's a virgin, very virgin!
A false charge
is a serious crime,
punishable by prison.
Answer!
Call the doctor.
l'll have you examined
to confirm you haven't
charged falsely.
-Are you opposed?
-No.
-Why?
-Good.
And you, ma'am?
And you?
You either?
-And you, Agnese?
-l don't want to!
-l've already been examined!
-That's not true!
-Wait!
-l didn't move.
We're wasting time
with an hysterical girl!
Are you a virgin or not?
-Answer!
-He knows it!
He knows what happened
that night!
-Me?
-Yes, you!
Tell him if l'm a virgin!
lf you're not,
what do l have to do with it?
Did it have to be me?
My family is old and honored.
lt has never been forced
to turn to the law.
We've had our share
of violent deaths too,
but we accepted those
with dignity.
We are at the point
where l must confirm
that this unlucky girl was
manhandled by that pig!
We have witnesses,
the first being the priest.
l didn't know a thing
about any of this!
Write that down!
-Stop that!
-l have a fever too.
You have to demolish her
morally.
Counselor, what are you doing?
Not you, the other one.
Show that she was already
corrupt or you're in trouble.
He'd like to recount how this
presumed seduction came about.
You'll have to write some more.
Come...
We'll hear it...
l had been visiting the
Ascalone home for some time,
as it is the home
of my ex-fiancé,
Miss Matilde.
l had already noticed
certain of her behaviors
certain inviting glances
but l didn't consider them,
in fact they were embarassing.
-He's lying!
-Hurry this up!
On July 12th,
l was invited fo a meal.
-ln the morning?!
-No, at one o'clock.
Then say "lunch"!
After eating,
everyone took a nap.
l stayed in the living room
with Matilde
and her sister.
Are you smoking?
What are you reading?
l'm thirsty. Excuse me...
What?
Have you gone crazy?
What are you doing?
What do you want to do
to me?
l want you!
l'm engaged!
That's enough!
Agnese, what's wrong?
Take her outside.
Did you write that?
You'll have to repeat that
at the trial.
-Do the charges stand?
-Arrest him!
l'll request release on bail.
Your client is under
arrest for now.
You can go!
You are charged with assault
with a weapon.
-Shall l close the door?
-Yes.
Laugh! You laugh too
or l'll break your head!
Would you like some
ice cream? l know you like it!
Would you like some too?
5 lemon ice creams.
How pretty you are!
l want pistachio.
Not bad. l hope this isn't
too sophisticated.
Dear friend,
l'm curious about something.
ls it true that Antonio fought
with Peppino Califano?
You can't hide anything
in this town!
lt's true, because Matilde
left Peppino
and Peppino thought we were
against their engagement.
-lsn't it true?
-We're not in the dark ages!
Matilde didn't like him,
and that was that!
You cannot command
the heart!
Criminal, spy!
Get out of the way!
Coward!
l did my duty.
Matilde is here! Quiet!
You'll never come out again,
not even for the toilet!
l understand everything.
You wanted to force Peppino
to marry me. lt's too late!
lf he doesn't want me,
he doesn't deserve me.
But, thank you.
Thank you too, brother.
lt's the Baron! l'm coming!
The law speaks clearly.
Article 544.
For the foreseen crimes
of article 530:
physical violence,
corruption of a minor, etc...
marriage to the offended party
eliminates the crime.
-He has to marry her.
-l won't marry her!
l'd rather go tojail!
You can't give us the same
story you gave thejudge.
He didn't believe you either!
You dishonored her!
lf l marry her, she's not
dishonored anymore.
Wonderful logic!
With a criminal record, you
can't take the test for the job.
Damn!
Be brave, the lawyer
was able to get you out.
-Released on bail.
-They put me on a cross!
On a cross, Mama!
-There she is!
-Bring her here!
Peppino, be happy that you
are marrying this whore.
-No!!
-l declare you man and wife!
Everything's okay!
Article 530 states that
in the case of corruption...
Califano...
Papa, they're coming.
l want them to be humiliated
in front of the whole town!
What do they want from me?
l don't want Peppino now.
l'm not a rag you can throw
away and pick up again.
What satisfaction
for that rotten blackmailer.
Stay calm.
Don Vincenzo, we beg you...
Pardon, l'm very busy.
We had a long talk with
Peppino. He's willing to...
-To what?
-To marry Agnese.
What an honor!
That's too good for you
and too easy.
Too good, too easy
and far too simple!
Why are you being
so strange?
Anger is out of place, we
are all up to our necks here.
Why are you being
so strange?
Why should l give
my daughter to your son?
Because 8 months from now
Agnese will have a baby.
No, no marriage
and your son goes to jail!
Therefore, as this affair
has ended with the law
and the prospective
is a marriage in jail,
l'd be saying "The prisoner
and the whore will marry".
So, l'm saying no!
That's final!
Agnese doesn't need
this marriage
as she is a virgin.
l therefore refuse!
You have the right to insist
on trying to change my mind.
l can't stop you from trying.
-So...
-So?
Go on and insist!
Loudly, so everyone can hear!
lt won't be easy
to convince me.
l'll be very tough,
almost immovable.
You've made me angry!
l won't give my daughter
Agnese to your son!
Do you understand?
How petulant they are!
-What happened to you?
-Craziness!
Just imagine, that Peppino...
is saying that
we compromised him.
Seeing as he can't have
Matilde he's gotten it
into his head to marry
Rosaura... no, Agnese.
First Matilde
and now Agnese?
His parents told me
he's infatuated.
Agnese is 16 years old
and maybe doesn't
want to know
but would l give her
a man like that?
Please...
not a word to anyone.
-Just don't hit him.
-l'm not an idiot!
-More passion!
-That's pathetic!
-Make him hurry.
-l'll wait till he's done.
The whole town has to hear.
l'll never give you
my daughter!
Never!
-What happened?
-Be quiet, you disgusting girl!
Peppino is back!
Forgive him!
Maybe he loves me.
He still loves me!
Go to sleep!
Matilde and Grandpa
are leaving tomorrow.
She's going to Aunt Carmela
who's very ill, understand?
She'll come back
when everything is fixed.
-Write and tell us the news!
-Goodbye!
l'm going...
l must tell you something.
l know you sent
Matilde away
because of Peppino's
behavior.
You did the right thing,
but shouldn't l confront
this gentleman
to explain that he has
no right...
The Califano family does
not deserve much respect.
They were given
warning last night.
lt was really laughable!
l saw you smile openly.
Beautiful!
They look like your own.
-Not yet...
-Did he give you an estimate?
-He gave me the bill.
-May l?
-You have a right.
-l'll read it later, Rizzeri.
-May l call you Rizzeri?
-Of course, Papa.
-May l call you Papa?
-Of course!
Please, come to dinner.
-That's too much trouble.
-Lasagna and sardines!
At 8:30 p.m., Papa.
Excuse me.
What a happy day.
lllustrious Sergeant...
To what do l owe
the displeasure of your visit?
Pasquale Profumo, in brief...
l saw them come and go.
You tell me the rest.
That's a professional secret!
What a place!
Better, a lot better!
lt needs an atomic bomb.
-Get the jeep. We're leaving!
-l don't understand.
You don't have to,
just follow!
-Pity, there's a procession.
-There's a kidnapping today.
-A kidnapping?!
-A girl! Move, you idiot!
Agnese, where are you?
-l thought it was Papa.
-We're going out.
-We're going out?!
-Yes. lt's St. Liborio Day.
We're going to Mass.
Take a bath!
Where can l put these?
What, are you staying there?
lsn't there a kidnapping?
Exactly!
Where?
l don't see anyone.
They're doing it in town.
Lie down.
-What are you thinking?
-Nothing.
Stop thinking!
-lt's getting cloudy.
-lt's going to rain salt!
He's kidnapping a girl today.
What would you do?
l'd arrest him immediately.
This way, he'll marry her
and you'll have to release him
You'd also look like a fool.
You'd better learn that
marriage eliminates the crime.
Betrayal, physical violence,
seduction of the incapacitated,
exploitation of a minor...
Article 544:
marriage eliminates
everything.
Did you know that?
Even little kids kow that here.
-Why is he kidnapping her?
-He doesn't want her.
-Then why is he kidnapping?
-That way he's forced to marry.
-They're all in agreement.
-He isn't!
Yes, he is!
Sorry, l don't understand
anything.
You can't understand.
These are questions of honor!
lt should rain rock salt!
Dry everything up!
lmmacolata, go inside!
Agnese, go on the other side.
Annina is smaller,
she sould be on the left.
l've never heard of that.
She was on the left.
The other one!
Assassins!
My little Agnese!
You all saw!
lt was Peppino!
Let me go!
Michele, stop the car!
Go back to town!
l'll go to jail!
You're disgusting!
Get out of here!
What is she doing?
Did she stop?
No, she's walking to town.
She will be...
dishonored in front
of everyone!
That's impossible!
You miserable girl,
go back to town!
Everyone is waiting for you
in the piazza... Even dogs!
Shameful woman!
Show yourself to everyone!
Don't wait, keep going!
lt's alright!
The procession is coming.
Go away!
We can go now.
l kiss your hand...
and beg your forgiveness.
Look at me!
First, l'll slap you...
Then you can kiss my hand.
l forgive you now.
-Come inside, you fool!
-Thank you.
What are you looking at?
That's how things go...
My house is open
to all my friends!
-What is it?
-Wedding candies!
-Are they already married?
-Not yet.
We've asked for dispensation
of the wedding banns.
Where is the copy
of the letter?
lf all the legal controversies
can be resolved this way,
it would be wonderful, no?
Of course! Registrar.
Do you intend to marry
Miss Agnese Ascalone?
-Of course.
-Registrar, write that down!
-Where's Miss Ascalone?
-Here she is.
Do you agree?
Will you be happy
-to marry him?
-Very happy!
Do you wish to marry
Giuseppe Califano?
Answer!
Speak!
Answer, yes or no?
Yes! Yes!
She's crying forjoy!
They're tears of happiness!
She said yes, you heard.
Agnese, calm down.
Everyboddy out!
l'll stab you, you creep!
You won't stab anyone!
l'll charge you with assault
for maltreatment and
exploitation of a minor!
Giuseppe Califano...
You are still charged
with corruption of a minor
and now with kidnapping!
Peppino is being tried!
-When?
-Few days. Closed courtroom!
What does that mean?
The crimes are
unmentionable.
-He doesn't want her.
-No, she doesn't want him!
-The motive is clear...
-l don't understand.
He kidnapped her
and she still
doesn't want him?
Peppino Califano
is impotent!
You can see she's a whore
by the way she walks!
-Why is he being condemned?
-She's a minor
and he's already had her.
The kidnapping was a cover.
The sisters are like that too.
Awhole family of whores!
There they are!
-Vincenzo!
-Leave me alone!!
Move!
Ascalone, l must speak to you!
Stop!
You must explain to me!
We've ended up in the shit!
Get out of my way, you bum!
l may be a bum,
but l'm a gentleman
and you can't buy me
at any price!
You're backwards!
Uncivilized!
lgnorant!
Are you happy now?
Stop her!
Stop her!
l want to go away!
-Where?
-l want to go to Milan!!
l want to be a maid!
No, Miss!
-What about the baby?
-Unknown father!
Son of a bitch!
Why do you want
to send me to prison?
l don't want to!
Forgive me, Papa!
Papa! Papa!
Agnese, dear...
-You're better now.
-She's alright.
Why is everyone here?
-What is Aunt Carmela doing?
-She's here for your father.
Your cousins from Ragusa
are here...
and your aunts...
and cousins from Agrigento
that you never met.
Come here,
Papa's beautiful baby!
l want to thank you.
-Give me your hand.
-Give Papa your hand.
Thank you...
Come closer.
Come here, Peppino.
Give me your hand.
Thank you, both of you.
You idiot!
The veil...
-She's a dream!
-A cloud of love!
-What are they doing?
-Agnese is almost ready.
The ceremony is at 10.
l'm not going to make it.
Come closer.
l'm leaving you...
Don't say that, cousin,
for the love of God!
l'm going,
but don't let them know...
or they'll call it off again
and everything will be lost.
Tell them after the wedding.
-Vincenzo...
-Go now... Go...
-Tell them l'm fine.
-We can't leave him!
l'll rest... l'll sleep.
Please, don't tell them.
Lock me inside.
Laugh,
today is a celebration!
To life!
To life!
Maybe it's time we wrote
the truth to Mathilde
and tell her about everything.
My poor daughter,
two pieces of bad news!
Peppino is married,
the Baron left her.
There's a third bit
of bad news.
-What?
-Nothing.
Look, they're exchanging
the symbols of eternal love.
"Honor and family"
