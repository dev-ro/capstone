"After visiting Monsieur de Treville,
"d'Artagnan, in a pensive mood,
"travelled the long road home.
"What thoughts could cause
such a lengthy diversion,
"looking at the stars in the skies,
"now sighing, then smiling... "
About d'Arrtagnan,
what was he like?
Physically, I mean,
to have this beautiful woman?
He's nothing much, I don't think.
I've never visualised him.
It should be at the beginning.
- Here we are.
- Intelligent, I'm sure, but...
It says, "Long, dark face...
"prominent cheekbones... "
OK, he's a man.
".. a sign of cunning.
"Enormously developed jaw muscles,
"a clue to recognising a Gascon,
even without his beret.
- "Wide eyes, intelligent. "
- He certainly was.
"A hooked nose. "
Beaked!
That's it for me, I don't like him.
I don't like men with beaked
noses at all.
Shall we go on, Mum,
or leave it there...
Yes, go on reading,
I like it, you brighten these hours.
Of course.
"His dreams fly so fast
on the wings of imagination
"that d'Artagnan
already sees the approach
"of a messenger from the young woman,
"who would give him a missive
for a rendezvous
"a gold chain or a diamond.
"Young nobles would receive,
without embarrassment
"gifts from their sovereigns.
"Let us add that
in those days of loose morals
"they felt no shame
as regards their mistresses either,
"who would leave them
precious mementoes
"as if trying to conquer
the fragility of sentiment
"with the solidity of gifts. "
Gianni?
Sweetheart?
Right here. Coming.
- Viking!
- Hi, Gianni.
I'll be out in a sec.
- Hello, Biagio.
- Hi, Gianni.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Let me have a nice glass of white.
- What have you given me?
- A Ribolla Gialla.
Wow. Great.
What else?
Tonic water for Mum
and two Chablis.
- The usual?
- Yep.
What's the tally now?
Total's 46 euros.
Shall I put them in a bag?
Write it down, please,
- then when this...
- You'll pay later.
Yes, once we're over this...
- Bye, thanks.
- Bye.
- So, Viking?
- Feel how hot it is?
You're not wrong.
Cheers.
You aren't leaving town, then?
No, with my mother...
where can I go?
- You?
- Staying here.
After all, it's not so bad here.
Not at all.
What's new? Nothing?
Everything as usual.
- It's not quite chilled, this.
Ah, well. - No?
Well, it's hot.
- It's always hot in August.
- True.
So...
Not a soul around.
No one.
Look at that.
Here we are.
What you saying? Nothing?
You'll be off to see your mother.
Done the shopping,
even got her a cake!
Well, it's my job.
I know.
There's a tourist or two about.
Yep, some just went by.
They're all so white.
They're so white.
Like they've been bleached.
Hi, Gianni.
Here, I'll give you a hand.
I wasn't expecting you.
I rang the bell,
but no one answered.
Mum doesn't open the door.
She's wary.
Nowadays...
She does right.
But the situation hasn't
changed, Alfonso.
Don't worry, we'll talk it over.
We already have.
May I come in?
On you go.
Have a seat.
Just a moment, I'll tell Mum.
Take your time.
Just a moment.
- The administrator's here.
- I know.
He rang several times.
I'm worried.
So am I. I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to him and...
- we'll face the situation.
- Do what you can.
See what you think is the best way...
I wonder why he rang so insistently.
And why today of all days?
I can't understand why.
I couldn't say. I'll go through.
Would you like a beer?
No, thanks.
I need one.
You have the usual papers
and it's Ferragosto.
I'm sorry, but the situation
has got worse.
I don't know what to do.
The condominium has decided
to take legal action against you.
- The condominium?
- All of them, yes.
But who?
Especially the De Matteis.
Son of a bitch.
They all agree.
They want a lawyer because...
you don't pay.
- I know...
- You need to get moving.
I know, but how can I with Mum?
I'm always busy, my hands are tied.
We all have problems, Gianni.
I have dermatitis.
Dermatitis is nothing serious.
It can have very serious consequences.
I have to go to the thermal springs,
I need mud packs...
My wife and kids are already there
and I can't go.
Why not?
Because my mother
doesn't want to come.
She doesn't want to come?
What do I do, leave her
at home on her own?
- No, of course not.
- I can't leave her.
Of course not.
- Would you leave your mother
on her own? - Of course not.
Listen...
could she stay here for two days?
- Who?
- My mother.
- Two days.
- Your mother?
Are you mad? No!
I'm already loaded to the hilt.
Your share of the maintenance,
and extra work on the terrace
I could erase it.
I never use the terrace.
I've seen you there.
Then there are the gutters.
That's another thing.
I don't have to pay for them.
You don't make that decision
it's the condominium.
I'll credit you, I'll pay for you.
Two days, put her here.
Look at the electricity bill,
1,600 euros.
What an exaggeration!
You haven't paid in three years!
They'll cut you off.
Then there's the lift.
What lift?
The key for the lift.
That's nice, for my mother...
for me as well.
But use it when they can't see you,
- with a little discretion.
- Of course.
Otherwise they'll blame me.
No... Certainly.
So, two days, then, what do you say?
- Two days...
- Will you do it?
The work on the roof, the lift
the light!
- It's important.
- Very...
I'm pleased,
but his way of going about it...
It's how he is.
A bit crude.
We'll welcome her.
We'll be ourselves and welcome her
in the best way possible,
because when it comes down to it
it's well worth our while.
Absolutely.
- May I?
- Hello, Gianni.
- Come in.
- This is my mother.
This is for you.
Thank you!
- For you.
- What is it?
Wonderful! A cake!
Aunt Maria?
Come in, this is Gianni.
- Shall we go through?
- Let's.
Let's go.
Go right in.
It's lovely.
Here we are.
Mum, come and see
what a nice view there is.
Look at the panorama.
Pretty.
Your mother?
She'll be right through.
So we can all get to know each other.
Fine. I'm glad.
Gianni, where will Mum sleep?
Right here, it's very comfortable.
- It's good?
- Yes, it opens up.
No point opening it,
I don't need a double bed.
It's fine as it is.
Sure, but it's comfortable
opened up.
So in here it'll be...
- My room.
- ... your room, yes.
Could I try it?
I have a bit of a hard time sleeping.
I don't need a big bed...
Of course.
Try it, please, go right ahead.
Can you come and give me a hand?
- Pass it here.
- There we are.
Alfonso, will you give me hand, please?
Gladly.
- On you go, try it.
- May I?
Please do.
If it's no good, we'll change it.
Lie down.
Comfortable?
He's a great cook.
- I get by.
- And the menu?
We'll choose the menu.
Meat, fish...
Hello, my dears!
Welcome!
And this lady?
Aunt Maria.
How nice to meet you!
- What is it?
- A ring cake.
I love ring cakes.
- Mum makes marvellous ones.
- How lovely!
No, I'm sorry.
I... It's not... Your aunt...
I really don't feel up to it.
Where can I take her on August 15th?
Do I leave her on her own?
I can't bring myself to do it,
it's humanly impossible.
Should I drop her at the train station?
I understand, in human terms, but...
Here.
- For the trouble.
- What can I do with this?
I have expenses.
They eat like little birds,
they'll cost you next to nothing.
With all I took off
the maintenance, the extra work...
- Her health?
- A rock.
She just forgets things sometimes.
- She has hardening of the arteries?
- Sooner or later we all do.
Let's get this ready.
- Her nature?
- She's docile.
She stays put.
Remember, at 10pm an aspirin each.
One each.
Aunt Maria, don't get up.
Here's hoping.
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.
- Lovely to meet you.
- And you.
Goodbye.
- Come back soon.
- Tomorrow.
Goodbye.
- I'll see you to the door.
- No need, stay with them.
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.
Bye, everyone.
Sorry, is your son bringing some Coke?
I'm really thirsty.
- Wait.
- Maybe he forgot.
Gianni!
You're wearing an apron,
that's going overboard!
Aren't you going to sit
down with us today?
Not today, maybe tomorrow.
You're invited tomorrow.
- Or else it's not a holiday.
- OK.
He's been working so hard.
Your son can cook really well.
Maybe better than you.
What do you know about it?
I was the one that taught him, you know.
Teach a skill
save it for a rainy day.
- Is your son married?
- No.
He's had his relationships,
affairs of the heart
but they didn't end happily.
- Your fault, right? Jealous mum.
- No, I...
Aunt Maria!
I'm getting your bed ready.
I'm getting your bed ready...
You're good.
You'll be fine here.
Do you want your pillow here or there?
The pillow there.
OK.
- Do you have children?
- Yes, two.
Two?
Where are they?
One lives south of the city...
and one in Rome.
- Good.
- In Via Cesare Baronio.
I see.
What are they up to,
are they on holiday?
The younger one is,
the older one, not yet.
I see, that's nice.
Here you are, look.
- What do you say?
- Good.
Do you want to sit on it,
see if it's too soft?
- Have a seat.
- It's fine.
It's soft.
Good stuff.
Now you're all set.
Mum, I have to ask you a favour.
The administrator's mother
wants the TV.
Yes, yes.
Still got that apron on?
I'm working, give me a chance.
It's too much.
Let her have it.
I'm pleased, because...
that way they're together by themselves,
watching television
and I'm less involved.
I mean, we're doing this gladly, but...
gladly up to a point.
There needs to be give and take,
but it's a little demanding.
- Why, is something wrong?
- Listen...
just between us...
Nothing's wrong exactly, but...
I have to tell you...
that Aunt Maria is a bit hard to take.
She says the same,things
over and over
about these two children
it seems that one is...
the mayor of Frascati,
the other's a postman,
but what a postman!
Then there's that other little aunt.
She seems very nice.
She is, just a little funny.
She brought us that cake,
I thanked her very much,
but it was covered
with a bidet towel!
I was about to tell her...
You're right,
but let's not get snippy,
this is an emergency.
Let's not get snippy, because I'm...
But we can comment
just between the two of us.
You'll see, with this...
Let's see what you can do.
OK?
- Look.
- It doesn't look good!
In five minutes it'll have warmed up.
you'll soon get a good picture.
- Trust me, just wait five minutes.
- All right.
Have faith.
Look at the state of that.
Marcello.
- Come in.
- Hi.
- Thank you for coming.
- Don't mention it.
There's a situation here...
that's a little...
Let's go in here
where we won't be disturbed.
Cough.
Harder.
Again.
Nothing.
You haven't got a hernia, Gianni.
Do you know where you've got one?
Here.
The minimum is 110.
Is that serious?
No, it's not serious, but...
Let's say...
you should consume less salt.
And that pain you told me about?
Slight pain, I don't always have it,
only when I...
run or climb stairs.
It's a little pain, here.
- Down your arm?
- Sometimes.
- To your fingers?
- Sometimes.
Which fingers? Show me.
Here.
- These?
- Yes.
It's a stable angina.
Stable, don't worry.
Thanks, Marcello.
After the holiday
come and see me.
No one's in the hospital at the moment.
We'll do a check-up,
make sure everything's in order
so you can relax.
Thank you very much.
No, don't thank me.
I have something to ask you.
What's that, Marcello?
My mother's Romanian carer
has gone back to Romania
and I've got the night
shift at the hospital.
You have to take my mother
for the night.
Please.
Say you will.
- I will.
- How's your mother?
Fine.
Could you take a deep breath
with your mouth open?
Thank you.
And again.
Again.
- All right?
- Another breath.
- All right?
- Don't worry.
I'll ask you to breathe.
Another deep breath.
Fine.
Is the Parmesan OK like this?
Yes, just a little more.
Now this mozzarella.
- You add it.
- This wasn't cut up.
All right, let's cut it by hand.
We're like family now anyway.
- Don't use it all.
- Don't we want a crust?
It takes the right oven
to get a crust.
We have to see that it doesn't burn.
I see.
Would you like a drop breakfast?
It's good wine.
- Like some?
- Just a bit, though.
A tiny bit.
With a little water?
Yes, with a little water.
It's a shame, but I'll do it.
Here we go.
At breakfast Mum takes Amlodipine
for her blood pressure,
half a coloured pill,
her medicines are in the suitcase.
20 minutes before lunch
for digestion,
a Domperidone tablet
and the same before dinner
twenty minutes before meals,
Domperidone for digestion.
Before bedtime
the other half of the Amlodipine.
Foods which must
absolutely be avoided -
they're poison for Mum -
milk, cheese and dairy products.
She's intolerant
she gets terrible headaches.
Note - no tomato sauces in the evening.
Cooked tomatoes give her an acid stomach
and she can't sleep.
- OK?
- Got it.
I'll leave you these notes,
please heed them.
- Don't worry.
- Thanks again, Gianni.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at noon.
Thanks. Bye.
Thanks again.
Bye. Don't worry.
Please, go right in.
- See you tomorrow.
- At noon.
Here we are, make yourself at home.
May I introduce a lady, Maria.
I'm Grazia.
Pleased to meet you.
Come with me. I'll show you...
We're making baked pasta,
I'm waiting for it to cook.
Baked pasta?
You've made baked pasta?
I love baked pasta.
I'll show you your room,
then we'll be back.
OK.
It's lovely, so green
with all these tall trees.
This room is very nice, thank you.
- It's simple.
- No, it's very nice.
I like it.
Thank you very much.
Settle in, call if you need anything.
- I'll call you in a bit when it's
time to eat. - Thank you.
Grazia's here, want to say hello?
Honestly, if I could avoid it,
I'd rather stay here.
Actually, I wanted
to ask you something.
Of course.
Could you bring back the TV for a bit?
I'm used to watching the news.
- Of course.
- Can you do that?
- I'll try, of course.
- Be...
Maybe say, "My mother is a little... "
Don't worry.
Thanks. Bye.
With Parmesan, mortadella
sauce, until you've used it all.
- Then you put it in the oven.
- What a wonderful smell!
Marina, listen.
- I have to take it.
- Again?
I'm very sorry,
but I have to take it.
Are you serious or are you joking?
I'm fed up with this,
take the TV and get out!
My children don't want it
with white sauce.
It's nice.
There was a woman
my neighbour,
who wanted to teach me
to make it with white sauce
- but my children don't want it.
- Well, then...
They say, "Make it your way
because we don't like white sauce. "
Every time they come to my house,
they want baked pasta.
Grazia, sorry,
you can't eat that,
you can't eat it, Marcello...
In a while I'll do you
a plate of cooked greens,
some delicious carrots.
Please, you can't eat this.
She can't even have
the baked pasta?
No baked pasta,
you'll have vegetables.
- Me?
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You don't know how good
my baked pasta is.
Don't tell me that!
Marina?
Open the door, please,
I have to set the table.
We'll all eat together,
open the door, please.
No, I want to be on my own.
What?
Come on, let's work this out.
- I don't want to.
- You're not eating?
I said no. I don't want to eat
this evening, I'm staying here.
Grazia, here you are.
These are steamed
delicious and very light't.
Thank you very much.
They're vegetables nonetheless.
I'm having baked pasta,
I don't want that.
- Don't rub it in.
- I know.
My son is so good,
I have to be careful, it's true.
Rather than eat that
I'd go without eating.
You're supposed to take that pill.
It's Domperiz...
That one there, you need to take it
20 minutes before meals.
I'm sorry, I was late.
That's all right, take it now.
That's fine.
Your mother's not coming?
I'll call her now.
We'll wait for her.
Dinner's ready!
Excuse me a moment.
Are you hungry?
I can't wait to have baked pasta.
- Lucky you!
- I just love it.
Why in the kitchen?
Because that other lady...
Never mind
I've set the table in the kitchen.
The two of us can eat there
but not with guests.
I know, but it's an emergency,
let's not be snippy.
I'm not snippy,
but I have to say,
it's really not on.
Today is a little unusual,
dear ladies.
Excuse me, but...
someone's a bit snippy.
At least you're both good-natured.
- Excuse me just a moment.
- On you go. Don't worry.
Blast it.
Good boy.
Yes, but I told him
I make it with sheets of pasta,
but he bought another kind.
- Let's hope it's good anyway.
- It looks wonderful.
I can't eat it, but...
Marina?
Sure you won't eat?
I'll bring you a tray.
Would you like a drop of wine?
I can't drink it, I'd better not.
Maria can.
- Sip it.
- Thanks.
- I'll have a drop myself.
- Call your mother!
I've already told you, dig in!
It's impolite to eat without her.
Yes, we're sorry.
- We can't...
- Call her again.
I just can't,
have a sip of wine.
First we eat, then we drink.
Here we go.
- You liked it though, eh?
- Yes.
Yes, I did.
Listen, Gianni
I have to confess
I was too drastic in my...
- in my reply, I feel bad.
- That's something.
I'd like to do something
to set things right.
Of course. That's good.
Let's invite them to watch TV with me
that way we might
patch things up by talking.
Good idea.
I'll try to be as conciliatory
and kind as possible.
Look who's here.
You've brought them, thank you!
The ladies would like
to watch some TV.
- What a pleasure.
- I'm so glad to see you.
Listen, is it just them? Marina?
Marina...
doesn't feel well. Have a seat.
What's wrong?
She has a slight headache.
Is that true or don't we know?
Can't we do anything?
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
- Really?
What would you like, a camomile tea?
- I'd gladly have one.
- Yes, me too.
Right you are.
Will you make it?
Careful with the flame.
- It's like being there.
- Yes, they're done very well.
- Here are your camomile teas.
- Here's Gianni with the camomile tea.
How sweet of you.
Thank you.
Your table...
We're...
- We're quite taken by this programme.
- Good.
Right...
My dears, let's see...
- Would you like some sugar?
- Yes, thanks.
- How many, two?
- Yes.
- You?
- How kind. No sugar for me.
Would you like
a nice cup of camomile tea?
You had a pleasant childhood,
which you carry with you.
Show me the staff of command.
This staff has always been crooked.
You were forced
to swallow some things,
you were a strong person.
We had a disastrous financial blow
and then Gianni died
my husband, my great love.
- I'd loved him since I was 15.
- That's nice.
That's how we saw each other
from one courtyard to the other,
that's what things were like then.
- That's nice.
- But then we...
I stood up to my parents
and got married,
it was a wonderful marriage.
- It shows.
- You're so good, thank you.
You know, I feel lifted.
You'll reach a hundred, you know.
But not with a carer.
No, you're not the type.
That's no fun.
Don't think about it.
No, because I see so many like that.
- Don't think about it.
- Thank you.
Right, now read mine.
What a tiny hand!
You're such a dear!
You are very lucky.
- Yes?
- I'd say you're lucky.
I don't know if your life really was,
but you have a nice life,
you've been able
to keep things in check.
At least, I think that's what I see.
Show me the staff of command.
It's not crooked
it's nice and straight.
It's nice and straight.
At 80 Granny Maria still makes
the best baked pasta there is
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Paolo and Agnese
Maria?
Are you hot, are you all right?
- I'm a little hot.
- I'll turn this on for you.
Grazia, have you seen Marina?
No, I don't even know her
I'd have noticed.
You haven't seen anyone?
I've been here the whole time.
- OK.
- Bye.
Marina!
Have you gone mad, wandering off?
You scared me to death!
What's up? What happened?
- You just got up and left the house.
- Of course!
On a evening like this,
I want to be outside.
What do I say to Alfonso?
I'm responsible for you.
Never mind that.
I'm my own personal responsibility.
I feel good here
and I want to enjoy this evening.
You can go now,
just the same way as you came.
Please, come home with me!
No chance! For goodness' sake!
I'm drinking, smoking,
you want to take me home already?
Cheers.
- Come on, please.
- No.
Please, I'm tired.
No, you can say
whatever you like, but I'm...
I'm tired!
I'm fine here, thank you very much,
and I'm staying.
I'm smoking, drinking,
if you'd like to join me,
don't think twice.
- Want a drop?
- I'm too angry.
Have a drink, it'll calm you down.
Listen, now...
Don't worry, you're sleeping here.
Leave it, we'll do it together later.
What do you mean?
We have to sleep, it's late.
- You don't understand.
- Later.
Now let's play cards,
you'll forget you're tired...
My dear, look...
One to one, sit down.
Will you sit down, please?
I didn't want to come home so soon.
I know, but you're...
a young girl,
but I can't take any more,
I'm dead tired.
I've been working, did you see?
- And now you rest...
- I'll rest...
I'll sing you a lullaby.
- No, you go to bed, my dear.
- Come on.
- I'll tuck you in.
- No...
I want to see how you sleep.
I can't even stand up.
Look, my dear...
- What are you doing?
- You don't need these.
- What are you doing?
- Off!
Marina, that's enough.
Why?
- I'll give you a kiss and leave,
because... - What good's a kiss?
Come on.
In that case I'll go out again.
Then let's play cards.
- We'll finish our cigarettes.
- And then?
- And that's it.
- And I sleep alone?
- And you sleep alone.
- I'm afraid.
Sweetheart, I can't help that.
Me too.
- You have to understand me...
- Good night.
You're stronger than me,
you're a rock!
Go on!
Marina...
- Let's see.
- Mercy.
Out with the truth, you're not tired.
I'm dead tired. Fit to collapse.
- You're pretending to be tired...
- Not at all...
I see it in your eye.
You have a tricky little eye!
- I'll go make you a camomile tea.
- For you.
Camomile tea, for me?
Camomile, at my age?
What kind of idea is that?
Come on, sit down.
Come on, give me five minutes.
- Five minutes.
- That's it.
- Right...
- You even took my shoe off.
Grazia!
You're eating all the baked pasta!
Give it here.
I can't leave you lot on your own.
Another little bit.
I see that I can't leave
you on your own.
That's the truth of it.
I have wonderful memories of Assisi too.
We live on memories.
It's true, Grazia, dear.
Without memories, what would you do?
You think of the house you lived in,
your grandmother,
who had to be helped...
down the hall when she went to bed
because you had to help her
take her stockings off.
So many wonderful memories.
It's really cold in Assisi in winter...
I used to get chilblains,
I'd almost forgotten.
I was always scratching my feet
because of the chilblains.
And when he came, he'd take me out...
I had to get up at T,
- I'd get up at T to go to Mass.
- Grazia...
Now... Listen.
Now let's try to sleep,
at least for a quarter of an hour.
I've always lived in beautiful homes,
now that I think about it.
The one in Bologna
was very beautiful too,
it was a grand building.
I like thinking about my childhood
because old age offers so little,
so you wander back through the years.
I love remembering.
They made tortellini in Bologna...
and lasagne.
See how beautiful it is!
Yes, but I don't want it so fancy.
We desire this at every age,
but especially at ours.
A close friendship, which is better
than one you go to bed with.
It's a close friendship,
a nice person
who takes you for dinner,
who invites you to the theatre,
one you can go away with.
He's intelligent,
but not a young person.
Maybe you already know him,
I don't know.
- No, I don't have any friends...
- It's important that you want it.
I'd like to, why not?
Good morning.
See how pretty she is,
our friend with the hat!
What a pretty hat you've picked!
- Isn't she sweet?
- Very sweet.
Listen, Gianni
I came in here to find out
where the tablecloth is
for the Ferragosto lunch,
we have to do something
a little more special.
- What lunch? Today...
- The Ferragosto lunch!
But today's the day...
- Today...
- Today, what?
Today the ladies are leaving.
- There have been some changes.
- We've invited ourselves.
But there's nothing to eat,
I have four eggs and a salad.
You've always done the shopping,
haven't you?
Valeria? Don't take this the wrong way.
I'd like to pay for the dinner,
I have the money.
My treat.
If it's not enough, I'll give you
the difference when you get back.
OK.
We want to contribute.
Thanks. OK.
If they want to contribute, let them.
I'm looking for some fish,
but there isn't a soul around.
Let's see if that one's open.
- There?
- It's August, what's on offer?
Let's go and see.
He'll be expensive.
We'll talk to him.
It's August, what do you want?
Let's go and see.
- I told you.
- I know.
Now, for the fish?
We'll see down there
let's take the scooter.
We'll see if anyone's about.
Someone must be open.
We can try.
We'll see what there is.
Let's see what they've got.
Is that all you've got?
No, I've got more.
Where are they?
- Over there.
- Let's have a look.
Here they are.
See?
See what nice fish.
Look, little mullet.
Have you got a corkscrew?
Yes.
It should be here.
Here it is.
- Open it.
- Let's have a little wine.
Have you got glasses?
Yes, I have.
I've got everything here.
Cheers.
Good thing there were some potatoes.
On you go!
Keep cutting.
Take it steady, we're in no hurry.
- Can I take the fish?
- Take it.
It's boiling hot.
Let's add the pesto.
The last drop.
- We'll eat this up, and how!
- Sure will.
- This looks fine to me.
- So that's...
ten euros a plate.
You'd ask for ten euros a plate?
- How old do you think he is?
- I don't know.
He's got beautiful eyes,
he's interesting.
- I said the same thing.
- Nice eyes, but I don't know...
But you gave it a thought, though?
For a good friendship,
nothing wrong with that.
- She's dangerous, you know.
- She is.
Like that, all bubbly, you see?
It's Ferragosto,
let's do something that's fun.
I'll put you next to each other,
that way you'll get to...
Happy Ferragosto!
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Here you go, Maria.
Drink up, Viking, this is good.
Excellent, I'd say.
Just a drop for me, because...
- Just a little, don't worry.
- I can't...
I get tipsy. Right.
Raise your chalices
to our lovely Ferragosto friendship.
Hurrah for us!
And for this delicious meal.
So, listen, do you have
plans for the summer?
Is your son still at the hospital?
Good, at least you can eat relaxed,
he'd have kept you from eating.
Right!
That's the truth.
He's such a good boy,
and I love him
but I'm glad that today...
I'm going to freshen up.
Why, are you that hot?
It's hot.
That's a little odd
he needs freshening every minute?
You know Viking...
You don't think it's because...
He's hot because...
Peut-être.
Peut-être, maman, oui.
To us!
We've had more toasts this Ferragosto
than at New Year.
Makes up for when you had too few.
Have you had too few?
Let's just be glad of these.
Mobile's ringing.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hi, Marcellino.
So, what are you doing?
Marcellino will be by soon.
Yes, I'll get her suitcase ready.
All OK. Fighting fit!
She's had her tablets and not only that,
she kept to her diet.
OK.
He'll be here in half an hour.
OK, see you soon.
- You're leaving?
- What do you mean soon?
- He'll be here soon.
- You're leaving?
Marina, I have to call Alfonso as well.
No, please!
- But we're all having such a good time!
- I know.
But the deal was that...
OK, but the day's not over.
- It's not over...
- No.
but in the meantime, I...
He benefits too.
Let's let him have his Ferragosto.
- It's all so sudden.
- It's all so hurried.
It's how it is. That was the deal.
So he'll take Aunt away too?
Yes, it was all part of the deal.
I'm going to...
But all so suddenly?
OK, you're right.
Slowly, slowly.
I'll wait a while
but then...
I've lost the party spirit.
After all our toasts...
What a shame.
Marcello...
I've prepared your suitcase.
I'll see to Marcello.
But this evening
we'll have something light,
vegetable broth.
Yes, with Parmesan.
