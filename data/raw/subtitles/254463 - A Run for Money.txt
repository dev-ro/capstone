- How much?
- 2,750,000 liras.
Won't you give me a reduction?
Sales have started
everywhere else.
Goodbye.
Ma'am.
- You think money comes by easy?
- Thank you very much.
Money comes by easy?
Did you deposit my pension?
I didn't have time. 
I will tomorrow.
It would be better if
you had done it today.
I'll do it tomorrow.
What's the difference?
- The interest would have started.
- A day later, does it matter?
A day is one more day.
Did you bring Nükhet's shirt?
There.
Just what she wanted. You're
giving her a reduction, aren't you?
Ten percent.
How much is that?
- 250,000 liras.
- Good.
Daddy, I'm ready.
Hello, Selim.
- Hi.
- How's Ayla?
Fine.
Business must have opened up
with this fine weather.
I guess it did.
I'm thinking of coming to
the shop.
We only have men's clothing.
I know, but this year the fashion
for woman is men's shirts.
This belongs to my brother, see.
I found it Daddy...
No, I found it.
You should be ashamed of
yourselves. You're big kids now.
Let's see what it is you found.
Money!
How terrible! You shouldn't
fight over a few coins.
But it's foreign money.
It's a hundred dollars.
It's really 100 dollars!
- It's lots of money.
- What do we do now?
Tell us the truth,
who found it?
- I did!
- No, no, we should return it.
We don't know
whom it belongs to.
- Well...
- What should we do? Actually...
We don't know which
one of them found it...
- It's the three of them together.
- They should split it then.
No. It's somebody else's money.
Maybe they'll look for it.
Well, we can't just
leave it here and go!
Let's exchange
it in the bank.
Just a minute. Hey!
Come over here.
Yes.
Have you lost a hundred dollars?
I'll take a look.
He wouldn't have
a hundred dollars!
If you ask that way,
of course he'll say it's his.
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No sir, it's not mine.
Shameless!
Come on, the banks
will close soon. Come on.
Come on. Aren't you coming?
Selim you're so honest!
New goods are arriving.
Shall I remove the flannels?
You can do it when
it comes in.
Shall I prepare
the new price tags?
The shop window
should be cleaned today.
- Do you sell towels?
- No.
Socks?
- No, try the shop next door.
- You don't sell scarves either?
We sell them in winter.
Not now.
We sell shirts, ties,
hats, and sweaters.
- Are they on sale?
- No.
- What kind of a shop is this?
- You don't intend to buy anything.
- I don't! Do you have white shirts?
- Yes.
- How much?
- Long sleeves or short?
Long sleeves for
the price of short.
The short-sleeved
ones aren't cheaper.
You take me for a fool?
I'll give you a long sleeves.
It's cheaper.
You merchants, you're all thieves!
Get out of here!
Listen man, you can't
order me out of here.
I pay my taxes!
Do you? Of course not.
We have to pay your taxes!
You cheat the people,
you cheat the government!
You're assaulting me!
As if it's that easy...
He said: "Money is
all you think about."
He's not even ashamed
of his children.
- The bill.
- Sure.
- Are the puddings ready?
- I'll bring them.
He said "I'm not getting
divorced in that case."
I've waited years
to get a divorce...
...he tells me
"I've changed my mind!"
What's his proposal,
did you ask?
He says "I'll provide
for the children."
The house is probably his?
He inherited it from his father.
What can we do?
- To get a divorce?
- No, for the money.
Or I'll take the apartment's
worth in cash.
That's asking for a lot.
- I'll get off here.
- You're not going to the wharf?
I've changed my mind.
I'll get off now.
Your bag!
Your bag!
What's up Selim?
What are you doing in the dark?
Nothing. I was too warm,
I took it off.
Why don't you turn
the light on?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
- I couldn't find a taxi.
Dinner's ready.
Did Daddy come?
Yes, he's inside.
Come on Selim!
The food's getting cold.
Daddy, please!
No, sweetheart, don't insist.
You'll be in bed in an hour.
Besides, children aren't
allowed to watch TV every night.
Other children do.
Not until midnight.
I'm asking Daddy.
Daddy may I watch a little?
Honey, why do you insist?
I said no.
Father, some pudding?
You look tired.
Daddy, will you get me a dog?
Of course, but when you grow up.
Are you worried about something?
No.
Daddy, did you earn
a lot of money today?
No.
- What are you looking for Selim?
- Nothing.
What time is it?
Go back to sleep.
It's not morning yet.
What were you doing there?
I was looking for
an old account book.
Are you in some kind
of trouble with fiscal agents?
No, honey, where did
you get that idea?
The old books aren't there.
I'll find it for you in the morning.
No, don't bother,
it's not really necessary...
Go back to sleep.
- But you'll sleep too.
- Okay.
Nothing, I just called to
hear your voice.
Oh, dear Ayla,
why do you say that?
So what are you doing?
Really? Gülsev's?
You're leaving right now?
All right, you'll be there
all afternoon then.
Fine, have fun.
All right. Yes. Me too.
Give me my coat.
I've some business to see to.
I'll be back in an hour.
- Wasn't the new stuff coming?
- No it won't. Tomorrow.
Sir, I couldn't have
the meter adjusted yet...
...the fare has gone up,
don't say I didn't tell you.
It's all right.
We've been waiting for
the raise for six months now...
Finally we have it. Price of gas
has gone up 40% in six months...
...raise in fares is less
than twenty percent.
We're robbed sir.
It's the government doing this.
What are the people supposed to do?
So the people steal.
You seen today's papers?
Yesterday, another bank cashier
made off with $500,000.
Good for him pal!
The guy's clever. He doesn't take
Turkish Liras, it's dollars!
Poor guy, he just tried to lower
the difference between...
...all the money he handles
every day and what he gets paid.
Did this happen yesterday?
Yesterday. That's what
the paper says.
Can you imagine the fun he
must be having right now, pal?
500,000 dollars! Wow man!
It's certainly a lot of money.
Mr. Selim, I sold exactly
six shirts while you were out.
Four of them winter shirts!
I sold them at the new price.
I put it down in the account book.
Are you looking
for something?
No.
You must sell
everything at its price.
After 11 years of employment as
Parabank cashier A.R...
...disappeared yesterday with
approximately 450,000 US dollars.
Bank authorities stated that A.R was
among the bank's most trustworthy staff.
Police declared that investigation
was under way...
...but that so far no trace
of A.R. could be found."
"CASHIER RUNS AWAY
WITH BILLIONS-... "
No photo!
If you're looking for the
lottery numbers I've got the list.
Exactly nineteen million.
Do you have any
change, neighbor?
- None.
- How about you?
I'm broke.
Do you accept credit cards?
- No.
- Oh, why not?
We don't.
- They accept them everywhere.
- They make you pay for provision.
- Oh! I've never heard of that.
- We don't accept credit cards.
I'm just asking mister,
why are you mad?
Mr. Selim.
My week's pay. You said
you would give me a raise.
If you were happy with my
work, you said. It's been six months.
- I'm not happy yet.
- Well, what more do I have to do?
- It's what you have to be.
- What do I have to be?
You only think about money.
I work for money.
You work in order to
learn a trade.
Half of what I earn
is spent on transport.
All you think of is money.
You ask for a raise just
because you sold a couple of shirts.
- Six.
- Hush. Only money.
God bless you sir!
Help a hungry man.
I want you to come too.
I can't. We'll all go together
in August. You go now.
Even if it's only for a few days,
it'll do the three of you good.
You're so generous.
I'll get your train tickets tomorrow.
We'll meet at the station.
- We'll be home Wednesday evening.
- Is this enough?
More than enough.
Thank you honey.
We have enough money,
don't we Selim?
We do.
If your beloved hears you'll be alone,
she'll crawl all over you.
Who's my beloved?
Nihal downstairs!
She really mustn't
know you're going away.
Consult Ihsan
about the house loan.
Don't forget to pay the last
installment for the fridge.
Your wallet! Your wallet!
436,200.
450,000 US dollars.
May I go out for lunch?
It's twenty past one.
I've got a watch.
Hello.
I want a summer shirt.
Plain or printed?
Where are the prints?
- Here. What size?
- I don't know.
Size three.
- How much are they?
- Three million.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
He doesn't intend to buy.
It's the policeman
on the avenue.
- Traffic police?
- Yes.
You may go out.
For heaven's sake don't eat
garlic again, the shop stinks.
- Yes Ma'am?
- Hi.
Welcome.
You go out.
Be back at two o'clock.
Ayla's not here it seems.
They've gone to the seaside
for a few days.
So you're alone. I'd have brought
you some food if I had known.
No, no. Ayla has cooked
and left a lot of food.
You've been kind
of funny lately Selim.
Funny how?
You know, funny.
Well, what kind of shirts
do you have for me?
- We have nothing for you.
- I want a man's shirt.
Can I try this one?
No, there's no place
for you to try it on.
This is my favorite shade of blue.
How does it look?
It's your choice.
Come on, get dressed now.
A customer might come in.
Are you scared we'll be busted?
"A handsome shop owner".
Even the words are provocative.
Nihal, for God's sake...
Oh, don't get mad, I'm leaving.
I'm buying this shirt but I don't want
to carry it around.
Please bring it when you come home.
I'll pay you at home.
- You better take it now.
- Come on. Do me this little favor.
Don't tell me you
don't like money...
I like it, but...
But what?
Are you scared of
living a poor life?
Yes.
How much money
would you like to have?
- Enough.
- Enough for what?
For my wants, for my needs.
There's no end to that.
Have you ever stolen anything?
When you were a kid?
Once I threw a hotel towel
into my suitcase.
I've never stolen anything.
Years ago, I had bought shoes,
and by mistake they gave me back...
...as change, three times
the amount I had given them.
- What did you do?
- I took it and left.
You stole it you mean.
I was in high school. One night
my uncle's family came to visit us.
My uncle had this beautiful lighter.
I couldn't take my eyes off it.
At one point he dropped the lighter
in the armchair.
It slid beneath the cushion.
I waited quietly all night.
First thing I did in the morning
was to pocket the lighter.
That's also stealing!
Is there a limit to what
you would do for money?
Ihsan, I should be going now.
Of course there is.
I wouldn't harm others.
That's a little difficult.
When will the linens arrive?
Any day now. I'll have them
delivered to you. It's very good stuff.
Am I fired?
Why?
Just because.
Sorry... Did you get hurt?
You tore my shirt.
It's not my fault,
you jumped on the road.
It could be worse.
Besides, my car is scratched.
My shirt is torn.
You can buy 3 shirts for the price
I'll pay to get that scratch fixed.
I don't complain and
you tell me "my shirt".
- Who is it?
- Nihal
My brother went out, I thought
I'd stop by. The dolma is for you.
Thank you. I had
already finished eating.
- When is Ayla coming back?
- Tomorrow morning.
So you're alone tonight.
I was about to go to bed.
I'm tired.
Okay. I won't force my way in.
I'll take my shirt.
That's right.
Sorry, I was
getting ready to sleep.
- How much?
- We'll take care of it later.
It's the first time I've seen you in a
stylish shirt like that. Sleep tight.
I would like to pay
as soon as possible.
All right. Good night.
Hello.
Four white shirts, size one.
Three white shirts, size three,
two short sleeves, size one.
- For our waiters.
- Will you buy all of them?
Are there any blues? One blue,
large, largest you've got. Make it two.
I forgot Hasbi.
How much for the lot?
38,400,000.
That's 160 dollars.
You accept dollars?
No.
Dollars man!
Okay.
Good. That's short 30 dollars.
130 dollars, plus 22 pounds.
- 10 pounds. And for 12 pounds...
- You're like an exchange office.
Here's a 100 francs.
We're 2 pounds short.
- You'll accept Turkish lira?
- It's okay.
No, no, I have Italian lire.
Here.
Take these.
Be careful, there's a lot of
fake dollars around. Goodbye.
Yes?
What is it?
Empty the cash register.
Come on, empty it.
Empty it.
- There's not much at this time.
- I said empty it! Hurry.
Empty it. Quick.
Come on.
Give everything.
Empty it. Quick.
Empty it. Asshole.
Asshole.
What's wrong Selim?
- I was robbed.
- Was he armed?
- How much did he take?
- Around 70-80 million.
Really? Let's notify
the police right away.
Don't bother.
But why Selim?
It's a lot of money!
Never mind.
Are you nuts?
You need a police report
to get reimbursed.
Forget it.
Good heavens!
There's nothing to fear.
Maybe they'll catch him. We shouldn't
let these thieves get used to this.
No.
But why?
There's another reason.
What reason is that?
I can't tell you.
Because...
Well... I mean...
The robber...
...was my helper
whom I dismissed yesterday.
Really?
The son-of-a-bitch!
That's even better. You know
who it was. Let's call right away.
No. Never mind.
Did you owe him any money?
No.
Well why don't you
have him caught?
He's just a poor guy...
You're really something Selim. The
guy comes and robs you one day...
...after he's dismissed
and you forgive him.
Only if he makes this into
a habit we'll be ruined.
I'd get him caught if I were you.
Or if you like we can get him
and get the money back.
You probably know
his whereabouts.
Thank you Celal,
I'll take care of it.
Do you know his address?
Well, how will you find him?
The police can trace
him from his name.
They sure can.
Just forget the police.
You're some compassionate guy.
Excuse my saying so but
I think this is stupidity.
You know best.
God bless you! I'm hungry.
Thank you very much.
Please sign here.
Safe number 148 is yours.
Do you want to use it now?
Just a minute then. My friend
here will help you. Mr. Hüsey in!
You haven't even touched
Nihal's dish.
She says, 'I insisted but
he didn't want'.
She had to force
the 'dolma's on you.
She must have invited you
to her house too!
- No. She came to the shop.
- Well, how about that?
She bought a shirt.
- For her brother?
- No, for herself.
A man's shirt?
She had something else in mind.
Oh, how vulgar!
It wasn't this bad. She got
worse after the divorce!
- Never mind.
- Did she pay for it?
Belma has built a very nice
house on the shore.
I loved it. I say, people
have got fortunes.
I went and looked at
our piece of land.
One of the olive trees has gone dry.
Belma said, 'Sell it, we'll get
a small place for you here...
...on the shore and you can build a
house.' I said you wouldn't want.
So what do you say?
But first we should buy this flat.
Everybody thinks
you've got a lot of money.
Well, well, I see
you've fired the helper!
Isn't that right?
You fired him, didn't you?
What did this one do?
He looked okay.
They're all the same.
The new generation.
You should hire somebody
right away.
You can't leave
the shop for a second.
No, I'm not hiring anyone.
It's better like this.
- You're a terrible boss.
- Sit down.
No. I don't have time.
Yesterday I found
two incredible paintings.
I couldn't make out the signature.
I'm sure it's a Russian painter.
The antique dealer doesn't
know how valuable they are.
- I would make a fortune.
- That's what you said last time.
That was furniture.
I'm positive about these!
- How much does he want?
- 180 for both.
But I'll get him to go down.
Even this is ridiculously cheap.
If you have money,
give it to me and I'll pay you...
...back in a week adding
ten percent to it.
I don't.
If you want, we'll
buy together.
You've squandered away
all your money this way.
- Forget about it.
- How much can you give? Nothing?
I don't have any money.
You'll regret it.
Just let me get the money.
Say hello to the family for me.
Bye.
What's up Selim?
Going out to lunch.
Lunch? So early!
You keep closing shop and going
off these days. What's up?
I'm going out to purchase
new merchandise or something.
By the way,
is there any news?
News about what?
The robber helper of yours.
Did you do anything?
Forget it.
Unbelievable!
Can't you be a little more careful?
You ruined my clothes. You can't
hold a plate properly.
- Give me the bill.
- You have no bill, sir.
- No, bring me the bill!
- No, sir, I swear I won't!
I said bring the bill!
I'm sorry, sir.
- Yes sir?
- I'll have it exchanged.
There are so many fake dollars.
Oh, of course, please!
Don't mention it!
26,350,000 liras.
What brand would you like?
I don't know, a good one.
This is the best.
It's more expensive.
This doesn't rub off.
Not even when you kiss.
Do you have a red one?
There are all kinds of reds. These
here. Do you want a flashy lipstick?
A red one.
You like red. Scarlet.
This one for instance.
Would you like me to put it on?
No. It's fine.
For your girlfriend?
For my wife.
Do you like it?
It's supposed to stay on.
About the flat.
Okay, I agree with you.
Let's not pay rent anymore. But
it doesn't seem right to buy this flat.
Well?
- Why should we buy this flat?
- It's been our home for years.
It's a good place.
The neighborhood is
getting very expensive...
If not this one, another place.
The thing is to stop paying rent.
You'll say again, 'Why should
we have our own property?'
No. I'm saying let's buy a flat.
But why are we buying this one?
Why don't we buy a better one?
Don't we deserve a better one?
Look at you, you've always
said we can't buy, let's not buy...
and now you look down on
this flat! I wouldn't mind...
...I wish we could! Selim,
you're funny. I wonder why.
Did you inquire about the loan?
No, I just thought about it.
Thought and made a decision.
Selim, are you joking, honey?
Weren't you the one who
was always saying...
...'I can't go into that kind of
commitment?' What about money?
He must have
taken care of that loan...
We'll take care of it.
We'll take care of that too.
The time will come for that too!
The last time you bought me
a present was when Esma was born.
- Six years ago.
- A long time.
You're still doing the dishes by hand.
We should first take care of that.
- A dishwasher.
- Yes, right away.
Selim, we shouldn't
overdo it.
You always say, 'Money isn't easy to
earn'. Let's not overspend.
- The money belongs to all of us!
- Of course it does.
Hello Mr. Selim.
I've brought the linen.
Mr. Ihsan said hi.
He also said to tell you not
to squander away too much money.
He meant it as a joke.
Good day to you.
200 dollars.
Would you like some dessert?
Have you got rice pudding?
Unfortunately, we don't.
But let me get you the menu.
No, thank you.
I would like the bill please.
Selim! Selim!
What's up? Why are you
loafing here at this hour?
I ate too much.
I'm taking a walk to digest it.
I saw these leather
couches and stopped.
Ayla has been talking
about a new couch.
Leather couches cost a fortune man.
Where will you get all that money?
Actually leather is so durable,
it's like an investment.
Considering a couch an investment
proves you're a bad tradesman.
What's a good tradesman
doing here?
You're right actually. But you
know, I'm sick and tired of it.
I don't feel like
staying in the shop.
I'm always telling you man.
Hire somebody.
Somebody you can trust,
a proper, experienced person.
Pay him well. Let him take
care of the shop.
Well, anyway,
that's harder for me.
What about those paintings?
Are they still for sale?
Selim, are you serious?
I'm sure they are.
I thought you didn't
have any money.
I received a large payment.
Check it out if you like...
...we'll go together
to look at them one day.
You're great.
I'm dashing off right now.
Right. Hey, Ahmet.
So you're coming tonight?
One thing, nobody should
know about the paintings.
A dishwasher's so practical.
You did well to buy one.
- Did you buy it on installment?
- No, cash.
That's best if you've got money.
Oh, no! In a country where
the inflation rate is so high...
...it's best to be in debt.
- Why, if you have money?
- To earn more money with money.
You say if you have money,
that's such a weird thing.
You can't spend it.
I mean, not like you want...
...because it's always for something.
Well that's not having money.
I don't know. If you ask me,
you pay your rent, you provide...
...food, then the rest you should spend.
Money that's spent
doesn't bring pleasure.
And then there's
spending and spending.
You'll spend it for your pleasures.
I'll spend it by investing.
- I'll buy a house, some land.
- That's not spending.
We mean different
things by spending.
I think that has to do with
how the money is earned.
It's easy to spend money
that's earned easily.
There's spending the
money you saved...
...and spending the money
you got from the lottery.
That's what you think
until you hit the lottery.
After you put the money in
your pocket...
...it's as difficult to spend
as the money you've saved.
Now, Eser is not the
type to spend easily...
Well of course there are limits...
Ahmet spends as he likes
when he has money.
But what has he saved
over the years? Nothing.
The thing is not to be
miserable for money.
Won't we all end up
in the same place? Is it worth it?
It certainly isn't!
You're absolutely correct pal.
You know Selim, something
has come over you.
You're more relaxed, easier.
I think because you understand
that money that's spent feels better.
He realized that he won't
become rich some day.
So why not spend it,
he thinks.
This Selim. How can
a tradesman be so weird?
Listen to this. The year we got
licenses at Yildirim Genç.
The year... twenty
years now, right Selim?
Selim is playing right-back.
I'm at left-field.
We're playing against Kuledibi.
The score is 2-2.
- No, 3-3.
- That's right, 3-3. Anyway.
Selim steps into the penalty
area and falls down.
The referee whistles for penalty.
So he gets up, he isn't hurt,
but he's pulling this long face!
He says 'I fell down on my own'
I say quietly,
'but the referee called a penalty.'
'But I fell down on my own'
he says again.
Kazim The Bear is getting
ready for the penalty kick.
He heard what Selim said.
He looked at Selim.
He whispered 'Shut up'
in his ear threateningly.
I tried to take this guy aside but
he walked right up to the referee.
Selim said softly, 'I fell
down on my own.'
The referee looked at him, pretended
not to hear and went ahead...
...with the penalty kick. Kazim
The Bear kicked that ball so hard.
The ball went over and out
and the game ended up 3-3.
So Kazim The Bear came and
slapped Selim in the face real hard.
I never knew this! I can't believe
you played soccer anyway.
- It's not like you at all...
- Selim is so honest.
But what he did there, I don't know
if it's being honest or rather stupid.
Kazim made you pay
for the goal he missed.
He's not either. This man's weird,
that's it. But an honest weirdo.
This is salsa.
What a night!
I'm tired. But we had a lot of fun.
You were a little
embarrassed too...
...weren't you, because
we've spent so much lately?
The dishwasher, new furniture.
We're going to purchase
a house. If only they knew!
Knew what?
I mean, business is
going very well lately.
So we started to spend a lot on
everything, compared to before.
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.
But confess that you were.
That's why you said you bought...
...the TV on installment. Actually
you paid for it in advance, didn't you?
Well that's not being dishonest.
Eser is in favor of buying
everything on installment.
I said it so he wouldn't
start preaching again.
I didn't say it was dishonest, honey!
Can anybody be as honest
as you? Everybody says so.
Come on, let's go to sleep.
My purse is gone!
Where can it be?
My whole salary's in it! Help!
They've stolen it right now!
Let nobody out! Close the doors!
Calm down Ma'am!
I just checked it a minute ago.
It happened this minute!
A brown purse!
Everybody stay inside.
Call the person in charge.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Please all of you stay inside.
The police will conduct
a search at the first stop.
Lady, there's something
under that seat. Is it yours?
Oh, it's my purse!
Is it all there?
Thank God! It's here!
Be sure about
yourself before you blame others.
How can a purse drop off
from a closed handbag?
Even if it did, how did it get so far?
If it's so valuable,
keep your eye on it!
Shut up! How do I know you didn't
take it and throw it away?
Officer, I'd like to make a complaint
about this woman!
She calls all these people 'thieves'.
Aren't you ashamed to accuse these
honest working people?
How dare you?
Okay. Lady, you found your purse,
so you leave it at that too.
Okay folks, curfew is over!
You can go out if you like.
Goodbye.
Hello. The paintings are still there.
Nobody's onto the fortune lying there.
Are we going?
- Hey are you sick?
- No. I'm fine.
You're pale. You're not
very cheerful either.
Look Selim, I hope you're
not worried about this.
No! So what happens? Are you
going to buy the paintings?
Aren't we buying them together?
Have you changed your mind?
No, I haven't. Let's go
look at them if you like.
Are you out of money?
There's no money problem.
I don't know, if you want to...
Let's go.
We can wait till lunch hour.
No, come on. Let's go.
I was going to close any way.
Let's go.
What do you say?
He was an incredible painter.
Can you see the
sharpness of that dark?
It's okay. It's just that my blood
pressure dropped. Nothing important.
There's nothing wrong.
You're okay, aren't you?
Are you buying them?
You've bought two fine paintings, if you
ask me. But this is all it's worth.
Maybe some amateur would be
willing to pay a little more.
What I mean is: don't
expect too much.
The man is obviously a good
businessman. A skilled merchant.
He's Russian, isn't he?
- Russian.
- The signature is.
Why do you say he's a merchant?
It's evident from the brush strokes,
that it's mass production.
Is it bad, if he's a merchant?
No. But paintings made for sale don't
bring in as much money...
...as the ones that weren't
painted for money.
I don't think these paintings
were made like that.
Well, if I say more,
you'll raise the price.
No, I'm just asking
what they're worth.
Can we pay right away?
Tomorrow.
Good evening Selim.
The kitchen fuse went off.
My brother's not home. Mother and
I don't know what to do.
Have you got some
fuse wire? Electric wire.
I wouldn't know.
There's some stuff in this box.
Would you mind looking?
I liked your shop a lot. I'll come again.
My mother liked the shirt, too.
You went to a lot of trouble.
Thanks a lot Selim. Won't you
come in? Have a cup of coffee.
No, thanks. Good evening.
Greetings to your mother.
Good evening. Sweet dreams!
Selim, honey, it's past eight.
You'll miss the boat.
- I'm not taking the boat anymore.
- Why?
It's too crowded.
It's exhausting.
But otherwise it's
even more difficult.
I'll open the shop
half an hour later then.
No customers that early anyway.
You know best honey.
What about your boat tickets?
Never mind.
I think we need a car anyway.
Let's buy one Daddy!
Hurrah! Let's buy one.
I don't believe this.
Last year we didn't talk to...
...each other for
a week because of this.
You said
'What do we need a car for?'
Will you exchange this?
I want to exchange.
Do rich people always talk quietly?
Look around. But it's beautiful.
Selim, how our life
has changed. It's so nice!
I want to say something, but don't
get mad. Just so I'll feel confident.
Why are we spending so much
money? Rather, how can we?
I robbed a bank.
Selim, please!
I'm not joking. I'm curious.
I robbed a bank. It's a lot
of money. We're spending it.
- It's impossible to talk to you.
- Why won't you believe me?
Selim.
We're still what we were.
Nothing has changed.
Only this: I didn't think then
that we could afford to live like this.
What do you mean? You
either have money or you don't.
Let's say I've received
all payments at once.
You're a retailer.
How can people owe you?
Did you loan somebody money?
Why are you so curious?
I don't know.
I'm really very happy.
But there's this uneasiness
I feel. I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm scared that it
might be temporary.
Look around you.
Is anyone scared?
I'm very happy.
What's wrong?
- Guess what.
- The paintings?
I'm sorry Selim.
It's my fault.
I showed them to three people.
All of them said the paintings
were very recent.
The worst part is, one of them said
these paintings were made...
...by that old antique
dealer himself!
The scoundrel!
Let's take them back.
I'll go and bring down his shop.
Let's take them back.
He won't take them back.
He won't. He didn't say they
were old. It's you who said that.
But still, he said "Russian".
Did he say "I paint this
rubbish my self"? He didn't.
The guy tried to warn us.
We were stupid.
It's none of your fault.
All the fault is mine.
Wasted all the money.
Well, I'll go to his shop
and take it down.
I'll take the police there.
Because that's fraud, isn't it?
Never mind. Don't bring
the police into this. Poor guy!
Why? Once he sees the police,
even the TV cameras, he'll know...
I'll take care of this!
- Stop! Getting angry won't help you.
Let's go together and have a talk.
You are an antiques dealer.
The stuff you sell has got to be old.
Everything we sell is old.
Your paintings are worth
what you paid for them.
I had already told you that you
might not get anything higher.
We're returning them.
We want our money back.
That's impossible.
We don't accept returns.
You can only sell the paintings back.
That's all I can do.
It comes to the same thing.
But I'm a second-hand dealer. I buy
things for much less than their worth.
Meaning I'll buy them back for one
third of the price you paid for them.
That is fraud!
No, it's trade. It's the basic
rule for second-hand trade.
Buying old things at junk price,
selling them at their worth to amateurs.
That's how I make my living.
There's no crime in it.
The crime is elsewhere.
What if I told you I knew the painter?
That won't make any difference.
Isn't it a crime to sell
your paintings as antiques?
I didn't sell you any antiques.
I sold you two paintings.
- Is this honest trade?
- Certainly.
For money. It's not worth this many
tricks. You will pay for it.
So, where's the studio?
Where's your antique workshop?
Okay Ahmet, stop it, let's go.
You know what,
I like those paintings.
I'll keep them. Don't worry about
the money. What's done is done.
Come on...
Okay. Goodbye.
Selim, quick!
We caught that helper of yours.
I called the police right away.
He was just passing by here.
Mr. Selim, say something, please...
Shut up or I'll...
Mr. Selim, tell them
for heaven's sake!
They say I robbed you
with a gun! Tell them please!
Cut it out!
Is this the person
who robbed your shop?
What did I ever do to you?
What you did is worse than theft,
you son of a bitch...
...robbing the person who fed you!
Was it him who robbed you?
Mr. Selim, for God's sake,
it's a sin. I didn't do it.
Well, what's done is done.
It's not important.
If it was armed robbery, it's not
enough for you to pardon him.
Let's go to the station.
You will tell us there.
Please give a detailed account.
It's just like I told you...
How were you robbed?
Was it him?
You talk as if you're not sure.
Did he have a gun?
Tell it in detail.
We will make a report.
Why don't you say it man? Talk.
First of all tell me this. Was it this
young man who robbed your shop?
Yes.
Mr. Selim, why do you lie?
Go and ask my family!
My mother!
I wasn't even in Istanbul after
I was dismissed.
You be quiet now.
I'll ask you too. Wait. Yes?
After I dismissed him...
...one day he came to the
shop and... robbed it.
Did he have a gun?
Yes, a hand gun.
Did you see it?
No, not exactly. Mr. Selim here
told me. I went in afterwards.
Did he have a gun?
I don't remember.
I'm not making a complaint.
If it's armed robbery, it makes no
difference if you make a complaint.
Plus, if he had a gun,
how can you not remember?
Selim, why don't you say it?
He robbed me holding a gun.
I guess it's new. Enjoy it!
I wish father was with us.
Actually it's fun to go on vacation
like this, as if we're running away.
Especially when you've got a car.
Why should we run away?
Mom, look at the lambs!
Well, did you decide
where we're going?
I don't know.
To a beach?
The shop will be
closed for two days.
So what?
Careful, girl.
Crazy beasts they are!
They're all killers.
They'd poke your eye out.
They're fighting roosters.
I train them.
I'm a rooster engineer.
People all around, up to Bursa,
know me. Ask and they'll tell you.
Ask if they know Ali,
the blind rooster guy.
I not only train them,
I do the operations too.
The salt-and-pepper one here,
I shortened his gullet yesterday.
It was infected.
Clipped it off.
Why do the roosters fight?
It's like wrestling.
It's a sports for roosters.
Some sports! The loser dies.
They fight till death.
Why?
For money, my girl, money.
There's big money in this.
Do the roosters get the money?
No, my girl! What should a rooster do
with money? With its tiny stomach.
It's all so that men like us
can fill our stomachs.
"Forgery creek".
Daddy, what does forgery mean?
Ayla, please give me that.
Daddy, what does
forgery mean?
It's making false money.
How do they make it false?
They make something
that resembles money.
Why do they make it?
Do you need any help?
Thanks. Flat tire.
I changed it.
Is there a tire repair
shop close by?
Right after the first village.
Two kilometers away.
- To the market?
- No, slaughterhouse.
The animals got a disease.
We sold these before they got
it too. Sold them at a loss...
- To a butcher?
- No, to the sausage factory.
Will they cut them up
because they're sick?
Oh no.
Our sheep aren't sick yet.
But they pay less than
the price of sick sheep.
I swear we sell them for the
price of dead sheep.
Well, good-bye now.
Daddy, why will they cut the lambs?
Esma, you ask so many things!
Come on, we're going.
You're worried about something.
We can go back if you'd like.
I'll go check to see
if the newspapers have arrived.
FUGITIVE CASHIER
COMMITS SUICIDE.
A corpse found two days ago near
the Arnavutköy wharf...
...has been identified as A.R. (37),
the cashier who ran away with...
...450,000 dollars last month.
The autopsy report points
to the probability of suicide...
- Shall we go?
- To Istanbul?
Bad news in the paper, Selim?
Nothing wrong, is there?
No. I'll go and get the car.
Esma!
Mommy, please.
No, honey. Don't even ask.
We can't take him. We can't take
care of a dog in a flat.
Mommy, please.
I said no. Come on, we're going.
Selim!
Forgive me honey.
Tell me why?
They beat me and beat me.
How did you get me out?
I was very scared.
Me too.
But I'm not guilty.
What did I ever do to you?
What's this?
It's yours.
What for?
Money heals all wounds.
And then you'll have me
caught for stealing it!
Leave me alone!
I don't want it!
This is your share of the robbery.
Forget me and what happened.
And don't pass by the shop again.
I always feel like I'm using you.
I always feel guilty towards you...
What's up? Some new antiques?
Ayla says, "These paintings scare me
in the night. Please take them down".
The fraudulent antique dealer
had to teach us a lesson too.
It doesn't look like you
learned your lesson.
You obviously have
a new project in mind.
Yes, I have a new project!
But this time I don't think you'll
be interested in the least...
...because it's a project
for making big money.
It's not for someone broke like you.
I've had enough.
I want to make money too.
I'm going into the historical
objects business.
Don't you protest Selim.
I've made up my mind.
There's not much difference
between that and antiques anyway.
I know, you'll say
'This is outright theft.'
It isn't. It's just turning an unowned
object into a trade object.
And no harm is done
to the historical object.
It may be against the law
but it's not a sin. Nobody is harmed.
What's the difference?
What's the difference?
A tombstone more,
a tombstone less.
- What difference does that make?
- Don't you try bringing me in on this.
I already told you,
'It's not for you'.
I just wanted you to know.
Your friend will soon be
playing around with billions.
Yes.
I'd like a short-sleeved white shirt.
- What size?
- Size one.
But it has to have
an unbuttoned collar.
Unfortunately,
this is the only one we have.
- How much is it?
- 2,800,000 liras
- How long till you're discharged?
- Two and a half months.
It's almost over.
You serve in Heybeli?
No. Coast Guard. Good-bye.
Bye.
One of those
who'll get you one day.
Don't worry, I'll be okay...
Smugglers always live by turning
each other in, you know that.
You can't make money if you don't
take risks. You know that. Goodbye.
- Where are you headed? Daydreaming?
- Nowhere. I just had lunch.
I thought I'd take
a look at the shops.
But everything's so expensive
I just looked.
It's summer heat today.
Terribly hot.
I love this, look.
Have you tried it on?
No. Can't you see
the price tag? How can I?
Try it.
Now?
Together?
If it won't take too long...
Selim! Brother!
How do you like it?
Nice.
It's very becoming.
I'll take it off.
Thank you.
It didn't fit me...
The gentleman said it did...
- He even paid.
- Thank you.
People have got
fine brothers!
I've got four. All they
know is to beat me.
He's no brother. He's just
a rich guy she's ripping off.
But she said brother.
That means the guy is married
and she knows his wife.
Really... the bitch!
Even so, I'm very embarrassed...
I'm late. There's one more
place I've got to go to. Good-bye.
Selim, thanks again, but just
between the two of us, okay?
Sorry! Are you okay?
It's okay. It's okay.
Good day. Do you sell sweaters?
Do you have an idea where
I can find one? Good bye.
Selim, these are worth
a fortune! Are they real?
Daddy, let's go to the park.
I'm tired, honey.
You don't do exercises
with me anymore either!
I'm very tired sweetheart.
Today my stomach hurts too.
Your stomach?
I probably couldn't
digest my lunch...
I'm very worried.
How did you buy these?
I'll tell you a secret. But even
my father shouldn't know, okay?
I've been wanting to tell
you, but I couldn't find...
...the opportunity, let's say.
A while ago, I hit the lottery.
But you never play
the lottery!
Well, the one time that
I did, I got lucky...
Well how much?
A lot.
- How much?
- A lot.
It's not something to be sad about...
Why aren't you glad? I bought you
jewels and you're questioning me.
Selim, it's true, isn't it?
So all the expenditure...
I kept it secret because --
You're right honey. They
wouldn't leave you alone.
That's why you were tense then!
You're such a patient man.
I couldn't have kept it.
Let's buy a flat first thing.
We shouldn't squander
away that money.
Where's the money? In the bank?
Something's bothering you
about this money, Selim!
Why should anything bother me?
You want to spend it all and finish it.
You want to get rid of it.
I'll help you do that!
- I don't want to leave without you.
- Where?
To the island, don't you remember?
Selim, please come with us!
I can't... I have to make
the inventory in the shop.
You're a lucky man, Selim!
I'm a lucky woman!
Come on, honey! If we miss the
eleven o'clock boat, we can't go...
...we'll have to come back, hurry!
Did you take the thermos?
I can drive you to
the wharf if you'd like.
Too much trouble.
We'll take a cab.
We won't worry about the cab fare!
Oh my God.
You scared me, Selim!
I brought you your electricity bill.
They get lost downstairs.
You were going out, I guess.
So Ayla is not home?
They went to the island.
Why didn't you go with them?
The island is so nice in this season.
I have to work.
I'll do the inventory...
So hot...
Well, don't let me keep you.
I hadn't seen this couch.
It's so nice!
Leather. I love leather.
Did they go to Büyükada?
I'll go now.
Selim... thank you for the dress...
Oh, Selim!
One would think they were
always on time! How stupid!
- How much?
- 2,750,000 liras.
