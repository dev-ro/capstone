All right,
bowl bid ridin' here for ESU.
Fourth down on the Georgia Tech 18.
Four ticks left.
- Set!
- Kane sets 'em down.
Blue 80!
Blue 80!
Hut!
- Arrgh!
- Uuh!
- Huuh!
- Aah!
Uuh!
Shit!
Coach, this is the second year in a
row you've failed to go to a bowl game.
Do you feel your program's
in decline?
I think we have a young team
on the verge.
We'll be goin' to
a major bowl next year.
Coach, there are rumors
that you might be replaced...
- if you fail to get to a bowl game again next year.
- Hey, Joe.
Good throw.
It was there.
Another year home
for Christmas.
Next year...
Next year we sell out.
Next year we dominate.!
You still need a deep threat or a
breakaway back to go with Joe Kane.
So, what are you gonna do
to address this need?
Well, stop wastin' my time
talkin' to you guys, for one thing.
Coach, any media...
I'm not going to lead you
into the fog here, Sam.
I'm concerned
about our program.
It's always been a source of pride
to our students and alumni.
Two so-so seasons is having a
damaging effect on our fund-raising,
both public and private.
Just let me get this straight. What
you're trying to say here, Grant...
is that after 12 years,
my job's in jeopardy.
I'm not prepared to discuss
your job right now.
I just want you to be aware
of the situation.
The alumni and the legislature
are unappy...
and they vote
with their checkbooks.
I don't pretend to be
an expert on football, Sam,
but I do know
we need to win next year.
Tickets are in your bag.
Itinerary and player profiles
are in your briefcase.
You've got a 9:00 tomorrow
morning in Philly with this kid,
Darnell Jefferson.
Damn. Looks like I lost
some weight.
This kid could be the game-breaker
we're looking for.
He had a 108-yard
kickoff return against Taft.
Michigars been down
to see him twice.
- What was the name of that high school again?
- Taft.
Taft.
Now, Darnell, you have the potential
to start for us as a freshman.
That 108-yard kickoff return
you made against Taft?
That was probably
one of the greatest runs...
I've ever seen
a high school player make.
Now,
Michigan, they're set.
A tailback for two years.
But with us and Joe, here,
getting you the ball
in our thunder right.
Ah, hell... Excuse me, Reverend.
You could be an All-American
by your sophomore year.
Yes, but I'm more concerned
with Darnell's education.
He came here late.
He's got some catchin' up to do.
Well, education is the first
priority of our program.
That's why all my players are
smarter than me.
Merry Christmas, Mama.
It's very pretty, Alvin.
When I turn pro, I'm gonna get
you the house to go with it.
Thank you, son.
Runnin' low on brew.
Didrt expect you
home this year, Joe.
- Wort be here next year.
- Yeah, well, we won't rent your place on the couch.
Merry Christmas, Dad.
Yeah,
merry fuckin' Christmas.
Woo, hey, ESU
Wejust wanna welcome you
Darnell, ESU Wejust wanna welcome you
Darnell, ESU We just wanna welcome you
Darnell, ESU We just wanna welcome you
Darnell, ESU We just wanna welcome you
- Hey, man, good to see you again. Welcome to ESU.
- Glad to be here, man.
I got somebody I'd like you
to meet. This is Autumn Haley,
and, uh, she'll be
showin' you around.
- Hi, Darnell.
- How you doin' ?
- It's nice to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.
This is it:
Wolf Den Stadium.
Damn!
Now for the starting lineup
for the ESU Timberwolves.
At tailback, number 20,
Darnell Jefferson.
They got that right.
Yo, thanks for showing me
around the campus.
I don't get the chance to meet
too many girls like you.
You got a lot of class.
Real efficacious.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Hope I can see you
in the fall.
Me too.
Good night.
ESU is where I'm goin' 
I'll be number 20, but we're
indubitably gonna be number one.
- Hey, man, good to see ya. How you doin' ?
- What's up? All right.
This is Bud-Lite Kaminski,
DarnellJefferson.
- How you doin' ? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's head out.
- Hey, I got a question for you, man.
- What's that?
- What happened to the band and the dancin' honeys...
and all that good shit y'all
used to make me come here?
Oh, yeah, well, uh...
Uh, regular students don't come
back for another two weeks, so, ah...
Not that they
would be here anyway.
See, ah,
we got you now, so, ah...
- Just another wormshit freshman, man.
- Oh, I see how it goes.
- Welcome to college.
- Ha-ha!
- Hi!
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Mary.
- Hey, Joe!
- Goddamn, the lead dog is back.
- How's it goin' ?
There goes my cover
of the media, guys.
- That's DarnellJefferson. Bobby, Lat.
- Hello.
Hey, Josie, can I get
a couple ofTequilas? Thanks.
Hey, Joe, you know, I was hoping you might've
rolled your bike or something this summer.
You know, nothing serious, just
enough to keep you out for the season.
Well, no such luck,
backup man.
But, um, perhaps could engineer a few
blowouts, give you a little mop-up time.
Much obliged, Joe.
My God, Lats,
you put on some weight, huh?
- Gained about 35 pounds.
- Shee!
Tried of watchin' you guys play, so I spent my
summer in the gym. I intend to start this year.
You get any bigger,
you can play offense.
Yeah, but don't I have
to get dumber then too?
Is that really possible?
Here's to a new season.
- Come on.
Hey, you still seein' 
Louanne?
Uh, yeah. Now and then,
you know, when the tide rises.
Don't want her thinkin' it's some
kind of exclusive deal, now, do I?
Coach finds out your nailin' his daughter,
you're gonna be playin' dorm ball, buddy.
I'll bail before that. 'Sides, that's
what coach gets for not startin' me.
- You never learn, do you, Collins?
- Heh! See you boys.
- It's pathetic.
- Alvin.
- Hey, dog, have you seen this?
- Oh, my God!
- You must be one badass motherfucker.!
- Like you didn't know!
I knew there was gonna be an article.
I just didn't know it was out already.
Shit.! We do all the work
and you get all the pub.
Too bad we ain't allowed
to hit you in practice.
Be fun to kick the shit
out of a Heisman Trophy candidate!
- Yeah, maybe you'll get your shot
in the pro's, huh? - Uh-hoo! Damn!
Hey, beer boy, gimme some peanuts.
- Are you serious?
- Does it look like I'm serious?
This is one of those
rookie things, right?
Listen to this.;
"ESU has a solid nucleus
returning. But the Timberwolves,
"coming off two disappointing
seasons, will only go as far...
as the strong right arm of Heisman
candidateJoe Kane will take them. "
Is that right, Joey? You gonna lead
us to the promised land like that says?
Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna lead.
- Question is, can you
boys follow? - Ooh-ooh-ooh.!
Autumn!
Yo, Autumn, wait up!
- It's me, Darnell!
- Hey, Darnell.
Whatcha doin' here? I thought the
students hadrt come back for two weeks.
- I came back early to see a friend.
- That's cool.
And if I may say so myself,
you are looking good!
You look like the package of pulchritudinous,
girl. Let's get together later tonight.
Let's get some pizza, let's
kick it, let's just hang out.
- I can't tonight.
- What about tomorrow night then?
Darnell, I don't think it's a real
good idea that we see each other.
What, I'm not good enough for you all
of a sudden? I'm too young, that's it.
I'm not as young as you think I am.
They held me back a year, you know.
- That's not it.
- What is it then?
I have a boyfriend.
Did you have this boyfriend
when you showed me around?
Yes.
Well, um, it didn't seem
to bother you then.
- I'm willing to overlook it now.
- I was mad at him then.
- For what?
- I caught him with another girl.
- A white girl.
- A white girl?
You're still with this nigger?
You won't gimme no play?
Look, Darnell,
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to lead you on in any
way, but I'm really glad you came here.
See ya.
Wait, hold up,
hold up, hold up!
I can at least walk with you, can't I?
Ain't no crime in that.
- I'm in a hurry.
- I can keep up. I run the 40 in 4.3.
- Woo-ha-he!
- Hey, Autumn.
- Hey, Ray.
- Where you been?
I was just talking to a friend of mine.
Ray, this is...
DarnellJefferson,
tailback.
Ray Griffen,
starting tailback.
Yeah, I know.
That's why they recruited me.
The two boys they recruited
before you are washing cars now.
- You better start strengthenin' your wrist.
- Huh!
This guy's kinda funny.
Listen, man, just make sure and give
your best to Miss Lily for me, all right?
Stay black, bro!
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?
Twenty-one minutes remaining
in math section two.
Twenty-one minutes.
Hey, when are we gettin' them
scores back on our placement test?
Who cares?
I flunked three times before I got in.
Long as you in the program,
they'll get you through.
Maybe not with a degree, but
they're gonna keep you eligible.
Just don't do nothin' embarrassin'
they can't cover you for.
Hell, they even give Alvin here
copies of his test in advance.
Sells 'em for 100 bucks a pop
to people in his class.
'Course he, ah, still gotta have
somebody read 'em to 'im!
Fuck you, doughboy, I can read!
See that shoe? It says "Adidas. "
I taught him that.
Still, don't know, man.
Promised the Rev I'd get a degree.
I don't wanna
let him down.
What do you think, nigger?
You gonna be on the Supreme Court?
All you need to know
is how to sign an NFL contract.
- Period.
- Yup, yup.
I think both Joe and the
university are best served...
by a straightforward Heisman
campaign; nothing too gimmicky.
In order to capitalize on the momentum
created by the Sports Illustrated cover,
we've compiled a mailing list
of around 1,300 opinion makers:
Newspapers, football writers,
sports anchors.
First we send them a packet
on Joe and his achievements:
Bio, stats,
plus human interest stuff;
committed to academics,
charity work, etc.
Then we update it each week with a postcard.
Heisman voters hate opening envelopes.
You really think
this is won'th it?
I mean, you think I got a shot
at winning this thing?
Certainly.!
Plus, it's a good thing
for the program.
Publicizes the school,
gives a boost to recruiting...
And it's a great thing for you.
Jumps up your draft position,
the size of your
first contract, everything.
- It's a great opportunity.
- And all you gotta do is back it up on the field.
And we have no doubts
about that, 'cause we know...
"Kane is Able. "
Break!
Play Ball!
No, no, no. Keep that index finger
on the ball. On the ball, all right?
Joe's too pumped up, tryin' to win
a Heisman on every damned throw.
- I don't think he's ready for all this hype.
- Little late to worry now.
If we don't do
something to follow up...
that Sports Illustrated cover, it's gonna
look like we don't believe in our peers.
Hey, you let me worry
about it, please?
Yeah!
Set! Blue 80!
Blue 80! Hike!
Hah!
Uuh!
Huuuuhh!
Too high, big boy.
So long, sucker.
- Yeah!
- Comin' to get ya, field boy!
- Come on. Yeah!
- Lights out, baby!
Lattimer.!
Whaddya...
You cut out that
necktie tackle crap.
What're you tryin' to do, make a highlight
reel, huh? That man left you huggin' air!
You take this helmet and you put
it right in his numbers, okay?
Drive it through his guts. I don't wanna
see nothin' but snot bubbles in his nose.
All right, let's move that drill down
15 yards, let's go. Come on, boys.
All right, let's go.
Let's move it guys.
- Jefferson, are you injured or are you hurt?
- What does that mean?
Well, if you're hurt, you can still
play. If you're injured, you can't.
So are you hurt
or are you injured?
Uuuh,
think I'm just hurt.
That's good.
Then get up.
Oh, shit!
Now, that was a hell of a run
you just made.
Think how good it would have been
for us if you still had the ball.
This is a football. I want you
to carry this with you always.
Never let it out of your sight.
Hey, boys, listen!
Jefferson here's gonna be carryin' 
this football on campus.
Anyone of you guys see him, I want
you to try to slap it out of his hand.
All right, try to knock it out
and recover it.
Anybody but you...
return this ball to me,
you'll wish you were never born.
All right,
let's step it up.!
Welcome to thejungle
we got fun and games
We got everything you want
How do we know
Just 'cause we are
the people that can find
Whatever you may need
Whenever we're together,
honey
Grows thatjungle seed
Jungle
Welcome to thejungle
Wort you come along
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Please, please
Welcome to thejungle
won't you pass here every day
Learn to live like an animal
who's noble when we play
Got you locked up
with what you see
Tag it and you leave
You can have
anything you want
But you better not
take it from me
In thejungle
Welcome to thejungle
Wort you come along
Waah
I'm gonna watch you bleed
Shit, Lattimer's an animal all
of a sudden. He's gotta be on somethin' 
Steroids? How come you always think
my guys are the ones juicin' , anyway?
He's on
the punt return team for three years,;
then he gains 35 pounds of rip
in one summer...
- and an attitude to go with it?
- Gentlemen,
we're not doctors.
The NCAA has a testing program
for this kind of thing.
I suggest
we let them handle it.
And it's not that hard
to gain 35 pounds over summer...
if you hit the gym
real hard.
Uuh! Uh-Uuh! Aah!
Hey, how's your arm, man?
- It's pretty good for the first day.
- Cool.
- Hey, Bud?
- Uh-huh?
- How come you never ask me about my arm?
- You have an arm?
Wanna hold this for me?
I'll meet you outside.
No problem.
Don't strain yourself.
How ya doin' ?
Fine.
- It's a little late
to be workin' out, isn't it?
It's the only time I could get in here
when the football team wasrt using it.
Yeah, well, if it wasrt
for the football team,
you wouldn't have
all this nice equipment to use.
So what, are you firmin' up,
or what?
I don't need to firm up. I'm strengthening
my knee. I had orthoscopic surgery.
Yeah, I had my knee
scoped once too.
So, uh, you wanna go out for a
beer or something after you're done?
I don't go out with football players.
They're all full of themselves.
I saw you on the cover of Sports Illustrated,
so you're probably worst than most.
Huh! So you won't consider
doin' anything with me?
No.
All right, well, at least tell
me what happened to your knee?
What'd you do, fall out
of your convertible?
You know what?
There is one thing that I
might consider doing with you.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Shit!
Uh...
Thanks for the game, Heisman.
You took it real well.
I want a rematch.
- A rematch?
- Yeah, that's right.
Some other sport. I took my
beatings. You owe me one, right?
Either that
or you go out with me.
I'll think about it.
Give me a call.
- How'd I do?
- That was a real good date, Joe.
Remind me to take her out sometime!
Ha-ha!
Damn! Fuck.
Yo, my man. Can you tell me
where Gaines Hall is at?
- It's at the end of Douglas Quad.
- Thanks a lot, yo.
Where the hell
is Douglas Quad?
Darnell, I've reviewed
your placement test...
and I'm afraid you've failed
to meet our requirements...
in several areas.
Does this mean
I can't play ball?
No, it means you're going to have
to take some remedial courses.
Specifically,
Math 0, English 0,
plus an American history
survey course.
You won't get college credit for them,
but they will help you prepare to take...
the placement test again
at the end of the quarter.
If you pass at that time, you'll be able
to take regular college-level courses.
But first things first. To start,
I'm approving a tutor for you.
Tutor?
I don't need no tutor.
Any tutor.
And yes, you do.
What's up, Autumn?
Hey, Darnell.
What are you doin' here?
Hey, nothin' 
I'm just kickin' it.
I was talkin' to my advisor
and he seems to think I need a tutor.
Just to get me over
a couple of rough spots, that's all.
I was lookin' on this list
right here and I saw your name.
I figured if you can't keep
my attention, nobody can.
I'm sorry, Darnell,
but you're going to have to get yourself
another tutor because I've already been assigned.
- I'm tutoring Scott Sherman.
- Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters to switch us.
- Coach Winters wouldn't do that.
- Yes, he would.!
Yo, I'm a much bigger prospect
that Scott Sherman.
Would you look at him?
Look.!
He ain't nothin' but a big, fat, pork
rind-eatin' lineman on the scout team.
Come on, now, girl. You could teach me some
real erudition. You know what I'm sayin' ?
Will you stop using those big words?
It makes you sound ridiculous.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm improvin' myself.
Every day I learn a new word
out of the dictionary.
Mendacious, pejorative,
antithetical, commensurate...
And you don't even know
how to use 'em right!
Pretending to be smart is not
the same thing as being educated.
It's just a con
that makes you sound stupid,
no matter how big
a prospect you are.
Okay. But that's even more of a reason
for you to be my tutor.
You just
taught me somethin' .
Oh, Mr. Heisman?
- Joe? We got a present for you.
- Oh, no.
Carryin' you, as usual.
Kinda looks like you,
but not as skinny.
Joey, you're our hero.
Uhh.
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Joe Kane.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
I wanna know
what you decided.
I don't know.
I couldn't think of any other sports
I could beat you at.
Then I'll pick you up
tonight at 6:00.
Wha...?
- We're goin' on that?
- Yeah, I thought we might take a little ride.
I promised my Dad
I'd never get on one of those.
What are ya, one of those
trust-fund princesses?
It's okay for me
to play a game I don't know,
but I ask you to try somethin' different
and you hide behind your daddy?
Okay. We go slow.
No cowboy stuff.
- Am I goin' too fast for ya?
- What?
Am I goin' 
too fast for ya?
- Oh, no, this is fine.
- Good. Let's get it!
Stop!
- Slow down! Goddammit, slow down!
- Yeah!
Where are we going?
This isn't even
a real road.
Joe, are you
listening to me?
Joe, slow down!
Joe, look out!
Jo-o-o-o-oe!
Uuh!
Goddammit! You crazy?
How could you do that?
- You could've killed us!
- Woo!
Uh, that could've been ugly.
- Goddamn!
- I've done that 100 times before.
- Never with anybody on the back,
but it was fun, wasrt it?
You just wanted to scare me.
Are you happy now?
Yeah. Actually, the scream
was even better than I thought.
You got just about every dog in hearing
distance wantin' to mate with you.
Do you come here a lot?
Now and then.
Why?
Well, it's not exactly
a campus favorite.
This is more like
hidin' out.
Nice shot.!
I like to go places
where nobody knows me.
Why, is this
too low-rent for you?
No, no.
- My father owned a place like this.
- Your father?
- Mm-hmm. - What, you mean
he owned a chain of these?
No. You know, not everybody who plays
tennis grew up in a country club, Joe.
My dad could never afford
to send me here.
When I hurt my knee I was afraid
I was gonna lose my scholarship.
So, you're a full-ticket jock,
just like me?
Yeah.
Are you disappointed?
No, I just never went out
with a jock before.
Huh! Is that what's goin' on here?
We're goin' out?
What do you think?
Come on.
I think you're, ah, crazy for
jeopardizing your scholarship...
and a pro career by jumping
motorcycles off of highways.
Just tryin' 
to keep my edge.
- If you don't know me by now
- Hmm!
See, the guys, they...
They look to me 'cause they think
I'll do anything.
If I lose that,
then I'm just another guy.
Then we'd get
the shit kicked out of us.
If you don't know me by now
If you don't know me, baby
you will never, never never know me
- No, you won't
- You scare me, Joe.
Ah-hey
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never
never know me
The keys.
Look, I told you. During the season,
no unnecessary risks.
Any guy that's up for the Heisman
should be able to remember that, no?
Thanks. Good night.
Now, using the things we worked on
yesterday, I want you to write...
a two or three page essay about
some aspect of your life...
other than football.
What's in my life
besides football?
I don't know.
Your father.
You could write
about your dad.
I don't know
much about him.
He was off in Detroit workin' 
in a car plant when I was born.
Got laid off.
Tried to rob a liquor store
to get us some money.
Got caught.
Died in prison.
Some kind of heart problem.
Well, maybe you can write
about your mother.
She was usually
workin' two jobs.
One night she stopped at a grocery
store to get me some root beer.
She got caught
in gang cross fire.
Shot three times.
Died on the way
to the hospital.
Want me to write
about that?
No.
That's good,
'cause ain't none of that true.
Gee whiz, Darnell!
What kind of a thing is that
to do to somebody? It's not funny.
I had you goin' ,
didn't I?
No, you did not have me goin' ! Why
would you make up something like that?
Sounded more interesting
than the truth.
I never knew
who my dad was.
When I was 12, my mother took a
vacation in Chicago and never came back.
Well, then, maybe just this once,
you can write about football.
I've seen a lot of
shitty things in life, Autumn.
That's why I know
when I see something good.
Okay, let's review the chapter
I read you yesterday.
Which two city-states
fought in the Punic Wars?
I don't know.
Detroit and Buffalo?
- Oh, come on, Alvin.
You're gonna be tested on this.
Rookies, you pay attention. This is what
I expect out of you. Alvin, you ready?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, this is Mississippi State's offensive set.
Second and two on our own 24.
What defensive set might we call?
Eagle, zipper, hero,
unless the setback shifts into the I.
Good.
Third and seven.
- Oakie, thunder, lion.
- What's your assignment?
Kill the quarterback.
Hit the tight end so hard
his girlfriend dies.
- Kill everybody.
- There you go.
Ready?
Uuh!
Very nice game.
Well, you owe me a dinner.
But you're takin' it real well.
Now, George Washington
won a few skirmishes,
but he never actually
won a real battle.
- Still, he won the war...
- Shit!
Fumble.! Fumble.! Fumble.!
What the hell's goin' on?
- It's mine!
- I got it, man!
- I got it, I got it!
Return to your seats, gentlemen,
this is unacceptable behavior.!
Gentlemen...
- Gimme the ball!
- Got it, punk! Get yo' butt outta my face!
You lucky, chump.
Catch you slippin' 
Sorry.
I lost my ball.
You in there, buddy.
Yes! Yeah!
Starting defense!
Place at the table!
Woo-oo-oo!
Woo-oo, yeah!
Looks likeJoe's comin' around.
He should be ready for Saturday.
Place at the table!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Woo!
Jesus! You think
we oughta tell coach?
Hell no, he don't
wanna know about this.
Woo! Yeah!
Make sure you tell Lattimer that
the NCAA will be testing on Saturday.
Yeah, baby!
Starting defense! Woo!
As my upperclassmen know, we have Pride
Night every year before our opening game.
So I'd like each of you to talk about
what you like best about football,
and what you're most proud of
off the field.
Now, I've asked some
of my veterans here to start.
Lattimer?
I don't know.
It's the battle.
The goin' to war
with the other guys.
- Set.!
- Hangin' together.
- Blue 80.! Hut.!
- Havin' our own dorm.
Stayin' in hotels
the night before the games.
Settin' ourselves apart.
Bein' different
than everybody else.
Havin' a chance
to be somebody.
To do somethin' that people
look up to you for.
Your strength.
Your courage.
Not everybody
can play football.
We're the lucky ones.
The thing
that I'm most proud of myself for...
Just that I'm here...
and not in jail
or dead.
I ain't no statistic.
Well, the great thing
about football is, uh,
that you can lose yourself
in it.
There's no time to think
or to worry.
You just, ah,
you just move and react.
Hell, everything else
fades away.
Best thing
is when you get a guy.
Know it's... killin' him.
But you feel great.
It's just him and you...
and he's the one
that's hurtin' 
- Yeah!
- Game's on.!
Don't be late!
- Hey! This big enough for you, baby?
- Hell, yeah, I'm with it!
Welcome, everybody,
to the Wolf Den...
where the ESU Timberwolves, led by Heisman
Trophy candidate Joe Kane, open their season...
against
the Mississippi State Bulldogs.
The Bulldogs have won the toss,
so the T-wolves will be kicking off.
And we are underway.
Kick coming down to
Tyler in the end zone.
He's gonna bring it up.
Back to the 15...
to the 20.
- Brought down at the 22-yard line
by Powell and Ellswon'th.
- Now we'll see
how the ESU defense,
Led by All-American linebacker
Alvin Mack does...
- in its first test of the season.
- Yeah! All right!
- Hit squad is in the house!
- Yeah, it's party time, baby!
- All right now, baby, all right. Sixty minutes, balls out.
- Yeah!
Let's open up the whole can of kick ass
and kill 'em all.
- Let the paramedics sort
'em out. - Yeah. - Right.
- Razor, bear claw, stinger. Ready...
- Break!
Bulldogs coming to the line of scrimmage,
T- wolves in their standard 4-3.
Hey, 23! Don't think I don't recognize
you, you poo-butt motherfucker!
Hey, pay attention
when I'm talkin' to you, nigger!
- What?
- You're the guy who shot my mother, aren't you?
Shut up, man.
You know I never knew your mother.
- Hut!
- You were tryin' to steal her fuckin' car, you cocksucker!
You didn't think
I was gonna find ya, did ya?
But I got you now, nigger. I'm gonna
bust your gut open and watch you die.!
Hut!
- Lock pitches to Tyler, sweeping left.
- Say your prayers!
- Mack cuts 'im off.
- Aw, shit!
Come back here,
you little pussy.! Uuuh.!
- Oh.!
Tyler crunched by Lattimer.
- Fumble.!
- No! It's mine! It's mine!
It's our ball, it's our ball, it's
our ball, it's our ball, it's our ball.
They unstack 'em and...
ESU has got it.!
- Hell yeah! Hell yeah!
- All right!
Beautiful thing, baby!
Gettin' your nose in there!
Atta baby, B.A.!
Good pop, Lats.
Stay it, buddy.
Joe, Joe, come here.
Joe!
Let's go up top. Take the team
right away. Z-3 motion, let's go!
So we'll see
what Kane does here...
as the Wolves attempt
to capitalize on the turnover.
- Come on let's go. Let's do it, now.
- Let's take it to 'em now.
Trips right, motion Z-3.
Let's put the women and children to bed
and go lookin' for dinner, boys.
- On four. Ready?
- Break!
Yippee ki-yi-yo
Git along little dogies
It's your misfortune
and none of my own
Shut up, snowflake!
You think you're on Star Search?
Nope. We're roundin' dogies into the end
zone and the trail runs right over your ass.
Bullshit! You gonna be my bitch!
You gonna be my punk bitch, baby!
Kane fades back to pass.
Ha-ha! You'll never be
half the man your mama was! Aaah!
It's your misfortune now,
fat boy! Take this! Eat it!
Looking down field...
Ward has a step on his man.!
Kane going for it all.
Fires for Flea Ward
in the end zone...
Great catch.!
Touchdown, ESU.
- Yes! Yes!
- Hold on!
Get off me!
Stop it! Get off!
- Play is over.!
- 'Scuze me. My dogies just reached the end zone...
- and I gotta do some celebratin' .
- Fuck you.!
- Yeah! That's it, Flea!
- It's on the money, right there!
Hell of a pass, man.
Wish I'd seen it.
2.;05 left in the game.
Wolves up, 28-20.
Jefferson,
get in there for Griffen.
DarnellJefferson making his first
appearance at tailback.
Kane brings him up
to the line of scrimmage.
Hike!
Pass toJefferson up the middle.
Out to the 35-, 36-yard line.
Nice game for the freshman who had a
little bit of fumble-itis in fall practice.
Hey, hey...
Hey.!
'Scuze me, son, but we're gonna be needin' 
that football for another couple of minutes.
Right, right.
Huddle up.!
Eight seconds left.
Last chance for Mississippi State.
Hike!
Lock fades back to pass.
- U-u-u-uh!
Lattimer coming
from the left side... Oh.!
- He almost takes Lock's head off.
- Looks like you lost your bonnet, baby!
Yeah! Yeah!
Woo!
Yeah! Aha-ha!
Woo!
And that'll do it.
The game is over...
as the '93 season gets off to a
good start for the Timberwolves...
with a 28 to 20 win over
the Mississippi State Bulldogs.
- Get to keep the car,
got the house for another week!
One at a time. Go ahead, Rhoda.
This performance today, two
touchdown passes, another you ran in.
Where do you think this puts you
in the Heisman race?
Well, I really don't know about
that. That's up to you guys.
This way.!
And now, let's turn
to our Heisman watch.
We begin with Sports Illustrated
cover boyJoe Kane of ESU,
who led his team to an impressive
victory this afternoon.
Though the real test will come
in four weeks...
against Michigan and their
Heisman hopeful, Tim Waymen,;
Tim "he could go
all the" Waymen.
He'll be lookin' to do so
against the Timberwolves.
And of course, the "able"
Kane will be looking to do so as well.
Hey, Darnell. Did a really
great job out there today.
- Way to hold onto that pigskin.
- Thank you.
Little something for ya.
Keep up the good work.
- Played a hell of a game, son. Proud of you.
- Thank you.
- Let me talk to you for a second.
- Thanks again.
- Yo, some guy just gave me $50, man.
- Don't worry.
You'll get about $500 or $600 once
you start, dependin' on how you play.
But I thought we werert supposed to
take any money. Ain't that a violation?
You cannot live on no $500
a month scholarship money.
The NC-double assholes
won't let us havejobs,
so you take your money
where you can get it.
As a matter of fact, let me hold
this for you 'til you see the light.
Shit, oughta be
payin' us anyway.
Athletic department gets $3 million
just for goin' to a bowl game.
Pretty little funky thang
nothin' like I ever I seen
Woo.!
Pretty little funky thang
bouncy little play by play
Pretty little funky thang
nothin' like I ever I seen
Hey.
Forget it, nigger.
No chance for you there.
How do you figure?
Griffers goin' 
to medical school.
She likes that light-skinned
respectable shit.
You? You just
a ghetto toy.
- Can I have this one?
- Hey, I don't think so.
What you worried about, boy? You
haven't lost your startin' job just yet.
- Hey, you got a problem, buddy?
- Ray, just one, okay?
All right, just one.
Take it easy, Darnell. You are putting
me in a very awkward situation here.
I had a little encouragement
along the way.
Listen, I want
to see you, Autumn.
Not in a study hall;
not like your student.
- I want to be taken seriously.
- Darnell, I do take you seriously.
But if you haven't noticed,
I'm still with Ray...
and I cannot just go paradin' around
town with you.
We don't have to go paradin' .
We can go someplace different;
someplace that nobody'll see us.
Why am I even considering this?
It's crazy.
Hey, genius. You all caught up
on your arithmetic?
Yeah, yeah. You only gained,
uh, 37 yards on 12 carries.
- Hey, hey! Come on!
- You want some of this? Come on!
- Hey!
- Easy.
- Come on!
- Cool.
Just calm it,
buddy, Darnell.
So much for
team unity, huh?
- Yeah.
- You didn't have anything to do with that, did ya?
- Hell no! You know me.
- Chshh! Right!
Come here.
We need to talk.
Look, I'm gettin' a little
sick of that asshole, Autumn.
I don't like you hangin' out
with him. It's embarrassing.
- I don't hang out with him. I tutor him.
- Then have him get another tutor.
I can't do that.
I promised him I'd help him pass...
his qualifying exam, and I
can't go bailin' out on him now.
What the hell difference does it make? They'll
grease him through no matter what he does.
Nobody's ever gonna see
that boy graduate.
Hey, don't tell me
you've fallen for this guy.
He's nothin' .
He's just another gangbanger with speed.
I'm tryin' to help him out.
What're you more afraid of, Ray?
Losin' your girl
or your position?
Maybe you better think a little bit more
about what you're in danger of losing.
Well, maybe I will.
So, where you
wanna go?
Whatcha find?
Now, you gotta make it all the
way around at least once, girl.
You're right, Darnell. I don't
think anybody would find us here. Ha!
Hey, I figure the key is to
go places only white people go.
I think next time we'll go bowling.
Plus, I saw this on
Rocky, you know.
I always used to wonder
how a guy...
who's supposed to be such a
great athlete was skatin' so bad.
Nice form, Jefferson.
You all right?
Thank you, Darnell. This is fun.
Well, sort of fun.
Nah, you were good
for your first time.
Well, actually,
this isn't my first time.
My dad took me skating once
when I was little.
- Hey, your pops used to play ball for ESU, didn't he?
- Yeah. How'd you know?
I saw his picture
on the Wall of Fame.
You know, you got his eyes.
Luckily, you didn't get his thighs.
I know!
Make sure you mean it,
all right?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
What's your name?
Bobby Collins.
Could I see
your I.D. Please?
You took someone
else's test? Damn it, Louanne.!
I mean, how could you be
so stupid, stupid!
- He was behind, he needed help. I'm sorry, I just...
- Sorry?
I mean, you weaken my authority
with the players.
It looks like I'm runnin' a dirty pro...
And Bobby Collins!
Of all people,
Bobby Collins! Why?
I don't know.
I thought
that he loved me.
Loved you? Loved you? This guy
loves anything that wears a skirt!
This little rat bastard.!
Now you're both expelled.
If I tried to use my influence
to get you back in,
it just destroys my credibility
with the university.
- I just can't!
- I don't want you to. I'll get in someplace.
Come in, Collins.
Come in.
Coach.
Listen, I just want you to know that I'm real
sorry about this whole thing with Louanne.
I was real glad to hear she's gonna
be goin' to junior college here...
Shut up.
I could, uh, pull some strings
to help you out here.
But I won't.
You've embarrassed the school,;
you've embarrassed me,;
and you embarrassed
my family.
So, as of now, you are no longer a member
of this university or its football team.
Now, go clean out
your locker.
You get outta here before I knock
the piss outta you!
Have you seen this?
You got a "D" on your math test.
I kinda figured that.
I had some trouble on the last part.
Darnell, we went over this
entire chapter last week.
Look, I thought you wanted to learn. But if
all you wanna do is fake your way through,
then you're gonna have to find yourself
another tutor and waste her time.
Autumn, we just had a good time. Why
you gettin' all riled up about one test?
- So far it's the only test!
- Shh.!
Look, I don't wish to be cast
in a pejorative light.
Therefore, I am
dedicating myself...
to achieving on a level
more commensurate with my abilities.
Hmm! You're amazing.
Joe, relax. Look right at me.
Pay no attention to the camera, okay?
- Okay.
- You ready?
All right,
here we go.
Joe, this game is being billed
as a potential Heisman shoot-out.
Did you feel any additional
pressure this week, knowing...
- that you'd be going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?
- Set! Hike!
Oh, I'd be lyin' 
if I said I didn't, um...
The, uh...
I mean, you try to block it out
but it's basically impossible.
Everybody seems to be
talkin' about it.
The radios, the newspapers
and all the interviews, you know?
Then there's the TV, always tryin' 
to get some sort of hype goin' .
- Hold it, hold it!
- Sharon, what're you doing?
What you're saying is true, but I don't
think it's the message you want to send.
It makes you seem a little nervous, like
the pressure might be getting to you.
This game is nationally televised,
so most Heisman voters will be watching.
I think a more casual approach
is better.
Controlled, modest, casual.
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.
I'll make this take two.
Here we go, Joe.
Joe, this game is being billed
as a potential Heisman shootout.
Did you feel any
additional pressure this week,
knowing you'd be going head to head
against Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?
Well, to tell you the truth, Lynn,
I hadrt really thought about it.
So there you have it, folks.
Joe Kane remains unfazed...
before his battle against
Heisman rival, Tim Waymen.
Odds makers have installed Michigan
as a three-point favorite,
but the Timberwolves will have
the advantage of playing...
in the friendly confines
of Wolf Den Stadium.
Hello, Dad? No, I was
just callin' because, uh,
Michigan game is on TV tomorrow
and I thought you might wanna watch it.
It's broke?
Well, can't you go over toJackie B's
and watch it with Jerry?
Oh.
No, fine. Well then uh...
I hope you feel better.
Yeah. Bye.
Are your parents coming
to the game tomorrow?
My mom died
when I was young.
My dad's never
seen me play.
Why not?
I don't know.
I guess he doesn't like football.
- You're one of the best players in the country.
- He's just not into it.
Okay?
Okay.
Kane fades back...
sees his man...
Bad hands.
What's goin' on,
Joe?
You asked me out here like you wanted to talk
about somethin' , but you're not sayin' anything.
Are you worried
about tomorrow?
What do I have to be worried about?
I'm a Heisman candidate, remember?
Joe, why are you thinkin' 
like this?
You're havin' a great year. You've got
millions of dollars waitin' for you in the pros.
How do you know
what's waitin' for me?
You don't
even know me.
I don't know you?
How could you say that?
'Cause if you did,
you wouldn't be with me.
You only know the guy who's supposed
to be makin' millions in the pros.
That's what you think?
That I'm with you for the money?
- I don't know why you're with me!
- Fuck you!
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I don't know you.
Joe!
Joe, what are you doin' ?
Get off the track.
Joe!
No!
Joe! Joe!
Oh, my God!
Joe!
Oh, God, Joe.! No.!
Joe!
Joe, are you all right?
You okay?
Yes.
- Just lettin' off some steam.
- Why do you do this crazy shit?
- You should've got away from me
while you still had the chance.
I don't wanna get away from you.
What's wrong, Joe?
I'm a Kane,
Camille.
We're just a bunch
of drunks and fuck-ups!
It's what we do.
It's in our blood.
My dad, my uncles, my brothers. We all
drink and sooner or later, we all fuck up.
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm waiting for my turn.
You don't have to be like them.
You can give all that up.
Then what?
Then what would I be?
You'd still beJoe.
And that's enough.
4.;29 to go and it's been a great one,;
two undefeated teams
goin' after each other.
Michigan up by four,
24-20.
But the lead has changed
hands three times.
And, Bo, you get the feelin' that whoever
has the ball last is gonna win it.
Well, it's been billed as a Heisman Trophy
shoot-out. And it's been all of that.
E- S-U, E-S-U, E-S-U!
Third down and eight,
ESU at the Michigan 20.
- Slot right.
- Set!
Blue 80! Motion, motion!
- Blue 80! Hut!
- Watch the blitz.
Kane back to pass.
Can't find anybody.
Gets away.
Gonna run it himself.
At the ten...
the five.
Touchdown, ESU.!
What a run by Kane.
And Kane is still down.
He took quite a shot from Ryan.
- You all right?
- Sit him up.
You sure you feel okay?
- Yeah.
- He probably just got the wind knocked out of him.
It was a hell of a run, man.
- How's the head?
- Fine.
- ESU in a eight-man line looking for
the run on third and short. - Ready!
Hey, powder puff. You're the white
boy who ratted my brother out.
Sent him tojail. Kept that fuckin' money
though, huh? Left the blood to do the time.
Yeah, you're
the little bastard.
On the count of you, my brother's dating
his cell mate. I'm gonna make you pay!
You hear me, powder puff?
I'm gonna make you my cell mate.
- Mayday, mayday.
- You're gonna have 250 pounds of pissed off nigger up yo' ass!
Hut-hut!
- Mack on the blitz.
- Uuuh!
- Pass! Pass!
Waymers goin' for it all.
Hunt's got a step. He's got it.
Touchdown, Michigan.!
- This is our house now!
- Steve, that was a great clutch throw under pressure.
You just can't do it
much better than that.
- Is he all right, Doc? You ready to go?
- Yup.
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah, just got a little headache. Let's go!
- Let's get 'em.
Come on now, let's go! Let's get
it back! Get it up, come on, man!
We can get it back.
Now, come on, let's jack it up!
Get out there.
Let's go!
Ray, come here.
Jefferson, in this series.
What the fuck is...
Pick that up. Pick it up!
Ball at the Michigan 47.
1:02 to play,
as Kane brings 'em to
the line of scrimmage.
- Set.!
- They shift to the I-formation.
Brown 34!
Brown 34!
Hut!
Kane back to pass.
Aaah!
Setting up the screen.
It's to Darnell Jefferson
who has blockers.
Right there.
Right there!
Come on.
Bumped out ofbounds at the 20.
Great run byJefferson.
No stick, baby. You ain't got nothin' for me.
Hit me harder than that. Come with it, baby.
There wasrt nothin' .
There wasrt nothin' !
Yea!
Go, Wolves, go!
All right, bring it in.
Nice run, baby, nice run.
Okay, listen up.
L- right, P-25,
Tailback-C.
Let's put the women and children to bed
and go lookin' for dinner. On two, ready...
Break!
ESU, first and ten at the 20.
Just 34 seconds remaining.
Hut!
Kane, play action.
- Aaah!
- Pressure from the backside.
Looking forJefferson.
Eee-aaah!
It's intercepted. Intercepted by
Whitney. And that should do it.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
It was everything we expected it to be.
Fine performances on both sides of the field.
The edge in the much ballyhooed battle of
the quarterbacks would probably have to go...
to Michigars Tim Waymen.
Joe Kane accounted
for two ESU touchdowns...
but had that crucial interception
in the waning moments,
and that proved
to be the difference.
Where's Kane?
Where's Joe Kane?
Take care,
all of you.
- What's up, Autumn?
- Hey, Darnell.
- How you doin' ?
- Good.
- This must your father.
- Yeah, this is my dad, Lou Haley.
Hi.
DarnellJefferson.
Jefferson. Nice run you made
on that screen pass.
- Another block, you might have scored.
- We'll get 'em next year.
How do you and Autumn know each
other? You a friend of Ray's?
No. Actually...
- I tutor Darnell.
- Oh, really.
- In what?
- In math and English.
Ah. Well, stay on top of that,
Darnell.
I'd have been in real trouble if I hadrt
gotten my degree. I played ball once.
I used to put a copy
of my report card inside...
my helmet to remind me that college
was more important than football.
That's a good idea. If you'll
excuse me, I gotta get goin' .
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you, Darnell.
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey, Mr. Haley. Good to see you.
Still havin' dinner
with us tonight?
- I wouldn't miss it.
- That was a tough loss today, man.
Yeah, yeah,
I thought we had 'em.
Wait. I think we better
get back downstairs.
- Leslie, we're just gettin' to know
each other. - No, I-I-I better...
- You didn't come up here to stop.
- What are you doing?
Aaah!
Aaa-aaah!
Stop!
- No! No! No!
- What were you doin' ?
Leadin' me on?
- Aaah!
- Come here!
You're not goin' 
anywhere!
Somebody help me!
Help me! Aaah!
Jesus.! Get off!
Please!
Ah! Aaah!
Get off of me!
- Get off of me!
- What the fuck are you thinkin' ?
- Get off of me!
- Lat, goddammit, chill!
Well, it looks like this
will all blow over.
The girl's father's
a big booster,
contributes a lot of money, so he
says they won't go to the press.
- He said that, the father?
- Yeah.
I mean, he's not exactly happy about all
this but he doesn't want to hurt the program.
We're still gonna have to
suspend the boy.
He's never tested positive.
If we suspend him now without any proof,
he could sue us for jeopardizing
his draft status.
What am I supposed to do, sit around
and wait until he kills somebody?
Three games.
Why so many?
So many?
You're lucky I didn't suspend you
for the whole season.
What are you gonna
give as a reason?
I'm gonna tell 'em
you pulled a hamstring.
- Thank you, Coach.
- Don't thank me. You got three weeks.
Three weeks to kick these 'roids 'cause when
you come back it's not gonna be any NCAA crap.
I am gonna personally test you before
every game. Watch you go in the bottle.
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about all this.
Go on.
Go practice your limp.
Well, to a couple of real
college heroes, huh?
This is the first time I lost a game
and a girl on the same fuckin' day, man.
Guess when you think about it,
I never really had the girl.
- You know that guy?
- Not really.
- Then why you smilin' at him?
- I don't know.
He looks like that ESU quarterback
guy, Joe what's-his-name.
- So what? So you go and smile at him.
- I wasrt really...
I feel like an ink spot in a bowl
of milk. Let's get outta here.
You lookin' 
at my girl?
- I don't know. Which one is she?
- Wise guy, huh?
Mr. Big-time quarterback.
- The one who choked his ass off today.
- I'm really not in the mood.
What, you got nothin' better
to do than look at my girl?
Hey, Heisman,
I'm talkin' to you.
I said, I'm talkin' 
to you, Heisman.
- Are you too good to talk to me?
- Yeah, but I'm not too good to tear a hole in your townie ass.
Think you're a bad ass, huh?
You think my girl's hot for you?
- Probably.
- Let me tell you somethin' , take off your pads,
you're nothin' 
but another pussy.
- Oooh!
- Eee-uuh!
Aaah!
Come on, let's get the fuck outta
here! Get the fuck outta the way!
Come on, try to get him up.
Hey, Joe, could you do us a favor
and slow your drunk ass down?
Damn, Bud wouldn't like
you driving his truck like this.
- Bud won't care.
He doesn't know I have it.
Shit!
Aw, shit!
Perfect ending to a fucked up day!
It hit every newspaper, every wire
service. The guy had to go to the hospital.
And to make things worse, you
get picked up for drunk driving.
Now, I just can't
clean this stuff up.
I, uh... I had to agree...
to send you to rehab.
Rehab?
Oh, that's fucking...
I'm gonna be a fucking joke!
- Why don't you fix this like you fix everything else?
- No, I can't.
It's the only way I can get 'em
to drop the DWI and the assault.
We risk a definite
NCAA investigation.
You go to trial,
I'll lose you for a whole year.
You know how many athletes
have gone to rehab?
Not in the middle
of a Heisman campaign.
So you miss... You miss four games.
You come back in time...
for the last one against Georgia Tech
and then possibly a bowl game.
Then you got
your whole senior year.
Jesus.
You make the best of this, Joe.
I mean, stuff happens.
Darnell. Darnell.
Darnell,
wait up.
Hey, I been tryin' to call you.
Where ya been?
- I've been busy.
- Hey.
If it's about Saturday, I-I'm sorry.
It was just a real awkward situation.
No, it wasrt awkward, Autumn, it was
educational. I realize how you see me now.
I'm good enough to tutor, to go places with
but not good enough to tell your father about.
Darnell, that is not it. My father expects
me to be with somebody like Ray, all right?
- He wouldn't understand us.
- Why?
'Cause he's a good student, I'm not.
'Cause he acts right, I don't.
'Cause he doesn't need football, I do.
'Cause he's class and I'm not, right?
- Darnell, I didn't say that.
- You don't have to say that, Autumn.
I'm everything your father used to be
and don't want you fallin' back into.
- Darnell...
- Look, you was right from jump.
I should've got
another tutor.
Thanks for everything
you did for me.
Well, here's your room.
Just let us know if you need anything.
Thanks.
Hey, Bud, is it true what I'm
hearin' ? Joe's out four fucking weeks?
- Yeah.
- Shit.
Defense is gonna
have to pitch shutouts now!
And you're gone for three? What
the hell did you take that shit for?
Nobody seemed to mind
when I was layin' people out.
Shit, I bust chops too.
You don't see me all fucked up!
Not everybody has your ability, Alvin.
You do what you have to do to play.
Well, you're not playing
much now, are you? Shit!
Whole fuckin' season
down the drain.!
Yeah?
You have a phone call.
A Camille Schaeffer?
- She says she's your girlfriend?
- I don't want to talk to her right now.
Okay.
I'm sorry, he doesn't wish
to speak to you right now.
- What's he sayin' now?
- With Joe out, everything could be up for grabs again.
What is that you're
trying to say?
- We gotta get Bobby Collins back.
- Wait a minute.
- Did Wilson say that?
- No, no, the pressure's coming from the alumni.
- Wilsors not gonna stand in the way though.
- Yeah, well, forget it.
I know he's no all-star but he's good enough
to give us a split over the next four games.
This is my program
and I'll decide who plays.
Don't give me that high
and mighty bullshit.
There are a lot of
people on the bubble.
Four straight losses
and we're out of bowl contention.
How the hell is that
gonna make you look?
Therefore, members
of the board,
I respectfully submit that Bobby Collins
should not be given special treatment...
just because
he's a football player.
Would a regular student get a reinstatement
hearing if they'd been caught cheating?
Nobody's talking about letting the
young woman who took the test back in.
I think it's also instructive to look at
some of the courses this young man has taken.
Beginning Golf,
Voice And Speech Improvement...
I would like to point out that Mr. Collins was
still right on schedule to receive his degree.
In what...
Swimming Pool Management?
Old pompous ass.
I'd like to take his...
- Would you like to respond, Coach Winters?
- What's that, sir?
Would you like to respond?
Oh, yeah.
Um... yes. Um...
I don't know a whole lot
about this stuff here.
But I do know
that the, uh...
the punishment
should fit the crime.
Now,
cheatin' s bad.
And, uh...
I- I don't believe that...
you know, it deserves
a lifelong sentence.
Now, here we have a student
athlete who's taking...
college level courses,
wants to graduate.
Uh...
He's-He's made a mistake.
Bobby here's made a mistake. And uh...
he's been suspended for several weeks,
so I-I think he's served his time...
- and deserves a second chance.
- Like Alvin Mack?
We gave him a second chance.
Since, he's had five incompletes,
four withdrawals and still reads
at a fourth-grade level.
If you don't reinstate Bobby or you hadrt
admitted Alvin, you were taking away their futures.
And in Alvirs case, that could cost
him millions of dollars in the pros.
But this is not a football vocational
school. It's an institute ofhigher learning.
And when was the last time
80,000 people showed up...
to see a kid do a damn
chemistry experiment?
- Why don't you stick the bow tie up your ass?
- Gentlemen, please.
- S-Sorry. - Let's get back
to the business at hand.;
Bobby Collins.
As you know,
I played football here.
And I remember how hard it was to practice
and then study when you're dead tired.
So, I have some sympathy for this
young man. But I never cheated.
So the real question is
his character.
Since you know him better
than anyone else in this room...
and having talked to him and observed
him over the last several weeks,
do you think
he's learned his lesson?
In other words,
can you vouch for his character?
Sure...
Yes.
Uh, yes I can.
So the Wolves,
despite a sputtering offense,
edge the Boston College Eagles
today, 14 to ten.
ESU stayed mostly on the ground as the
passing game was largely ineffective.
Be all that I can be
Yeah, yeah
Say I can say...
That'll do it from here
as ESU was blanked this afternoon...
by a very tough Texas team,
13 to nothing.
The Wolves defense led by Alvin Mack kept
'em in it but turnovers led to both...
Longhorn scores.
- Wanting love is all
that I feel
When you're passing by
Wanting love
is all that I see
It's there in your eyes
Well, ESU on the strength
of a 62-yard touchdown run...
by steadily improving
freshman Darnell Jefferson,
squeaks by the North Carolina
Tar Heels today, 14-13,
keeping their once-fading
bowl hopes very much alive.
Hey.!
How you doin' ?
You suitin' up today?
All right!
The man is back!
Lattimer's back!
What's up?
ESU hoping to get past
a tough Iowa Hawkeye's team...
in their last game
before the return ofJoe Kane.
All set to go now.
Thigpen, the remaining setback.
Damn, I know you, motherfucker. You're
the one who got my baby sister pregnant.
Where you been, huh?
- Aw, come on, don't punk out
behind that mask now.
Answer me, motherfucker,
before I peel your cap!
Dixon pitches to Thigpen sweeping left.
Mack chasing the play.
- Thigpen cuts back.
- Oooh!
- Mack pursues inside.
- Aaa-aaah!
Oooh.! He's leveled by Morgan.
And Mack is down.
He's hurt.
They're gathered around him.
The doctor is coming out.
We can only hope this is not serious.
- It's all right, Alvin. Hang in there.
- Oh, shit!
Stretcher!
You're gonna be okay, Alvin. The doctor's
gonna take a look at you. Just relax.
Oh, my, this does not look good.
They're bringing the stretcher out.
Twelve seconds left. Iowa driving
for the winning touchdown.
Fourth and goal
at the one.
ESU trying to hold on without their
star middle linebacker, Alvin Mack.
- Dixon calling signals.
- Yellow nine.!
Go.!
Turns, hands to Thigpen
straight ahead off right tackle.
Lattimer meets him at the goal line.
Thigpen bulls his way
into the end zone.
Touchdown, Iowa.
Lattimer had him
butjust couldn't hold him...
as Iowa pulls out a
last-second victory, 14 to ten.
Coach, you've lost two
of your last four.
Why do your teams seem to nosedive
at the end of the last couple seasons?
Tonight was a tough loss,
but it wasrt a nosedive.
We've had a few key players out.
We lost another great one tonight.
But I thought you would know
that if we won next week,
we'd still be conference champs
and go to a major bowl.
See, I always knew you guys couldn't write
but I thought at least you could count.
Yo, Alvin.
Hey, Coach.
- How you feelin' ?
- I feel all right.
- You're lookin' pretty good.
- Yeah.
Hey, uh, any of the guys
come down to see you?
They called.
You know... how football players
are about hospitals and injuries.
Yeah.
I'm never gonn...
I'm never gonna play again, am I?
Doctors aren't always right.
Either way,
I want you to know that, uh...
you're the best damn defensive player
I ever coached.
No problem.
Hi.
How ya doin' ?
How's Ray?
I don't know. I haven't seen him since
the last night I saw you.
Well,
I just came by to see
how your studying was coming.
- Ready for tomorrow?
- Hope so.
I been studying
pretty hard.
Good.
I talked to my dad
last night.
- How's he doin' ?
- Fine.
Tell him
I said "hello. "
We talked about you.
What'd you say?
Well... I told him
that we'd gone out.
And that...
I wished I could
still go bowling.
Hey.
- How ya doin' , man?
- Hey, Joe. How ya doin' ?
- It's great to see you.
- What's up? Good to have you back.
- Good to be back.
- What's up, brother? Next game we blow some people up.
- You get any throwing done in there?
- Nah, all they got is Ping-Pong.
Let's get a picture.
Hey, hey...
Here, get
an aerial view.
Hey, Joe.
Lats, watch your boots
on the truck bed.
Hi.
How ya doin' ?
- Fine.
- Good.
You all right now?
Yeah, I think so.
I got a few loose ends
to tie up but, uh...
- Good, I'm happy for you.
- Hey.
I'm sorry that I, you know,
that I didn't wanna...
That I couldn't
see you.
You couldn't even
talk to me.
I was embarrassed.
I cou...
That's enough of the outs.
Let's run some deeper digs.
All right, quarterbacks, run your
deeper crossing patterns next.
Hut!
Aw, he's rusty, Sam.
I doubt if we can start him.
Yeah, his head's
just not back into it.
Boys, I thought we'd try
something different this game.
Maximize our speed.
Keep you both in the lineup
at the same time. So, Ray, uh...
we're moving you
over to fullback.
Darnell, you'll be our startin' 
tailback. Now, not everybody can...
handle the transition
like this, Ray.
You think you're
up to it?
Yes. Yes, sir.
Good. That's good.
- How ya doin' , Dad?
- Joe.
What's this,
they throw you out?
No.
- Heard about your little set-to.
They had it on the news here. - Yeah.
So, what are you doin' here?
- Just thinkin' about things.
- That's what the damn rehab will do.;
make you think about a lot of things
you can't do nothin' about.
I'm wonderin' why you never
came to any of my games.
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't wanna
make you nervous.
You might've tried too hard
and screwed up.
Yeah, or I might've
done real good.
How would that've
made you feel?
What do you mean?
It might've made you feel bad like maybe you
could've been something more if you tried.
Maybe I didn't wanna see you get all excited,
all pumped up with pride, when I knew one day...
- it'd all come crashing down... just like it did.
- Yeah.
But I'm still here,
ain't I?
I got one more game
left this season.
I don't how much I'll play... or if I'll
play at all, but I'd like you to be there.
How will you feel about introducing
your drunken dad to your friends?
Did you think about that?
I could deal with it
if you could.
This is a plane ticket,
a ticket for the game,
a 50-yard-line seat.
If you don't come,
I'm never going to, um...
ask you again.
Bill, what's this
doin' again?
Takin' the doped urine out of your
bladder and puttin' clean back in.
Call it an oil change.
- We are gonna
get it done today.
- We're gonna
ring the bell today.!
This is what you guys been workin' for.
I need 60 minutes.
- 60 minutes of mean!
- You got it, Coach.
60 minutes, no prisoners, no mercy.
Nothing but snot bubbles, snot bubbles!
You got me?
We're gonna ring the bell!
We're gonna ring
that championship bell!
Ding-motherfuckin' -dong!
Wolves moving
left to right on your radio dial.
They've had trouble scoring
with Bobby Collins at the helm.
DespiteJoe Kane's return,
Collins gets the starting nod.
All right, let's get this off to a good
start. L-28, thunder right, second blue.
Ready, break.
Wolves in the I
with a new look.
Set!
Jefferson now starting at tailback.
Griffen at full.
Hut-hut.
Blue.
- Collins pitches toJefferson sweeping on thunder right.
- 46, 46!
Griffen leading
the blocking and... Oh.!
Pugh goes right by him.
Oooh, fumble.
It looks like...
Georgia Tech has the ball.
And a tough break
for the Wolves...
as the Yellowjackets will have
excellent field position.
All right, let's go,
defense.!
Put your helmets
in their belly!
Goddammit!
Shit.!
Punk-ass Griffen.!
Defense!
Okay, offense, tough break.
It was there, wejust didn't execute.! You
gotta finish your blocks. Finish 'em all.!
Next time we get it, we take control.
Jefferson.!
You gotta squeeze the ball.!
You gotta put it away.
So the Wolves'defense
has held after the fumble...
and the Yellowjackets
will opt for the field goal.
It's around a 34 yarder.
Here's the snap.
Ball is down. It's away.
It's long enough...
and it's good.
The Georgia Tech Yellowjackets
jump out on top, three to nothing.
Twenty-five seconds left
in the half.
Collins is gonna go to the air if the Wolves
hope to get on the board before halftime.
- Collins fades back to pass.
- Don't throw the flat!
Looking in the flat for Ward...
The ball is tipped,
batted around,
intercepted by Wooley.
Down the sideline,
20... 15...
ten... touchdown,
Georgia Tech.
And it looks like the Yellowjackets
will go in at halftime...
with a ten-nothing lead.
Come on, guys, we're only down ten.!
Now let's get our fuckin' shit together
and kick some fuckin' ass!
Come on, guys, now, we got
30 minutes of football left.!
- Thirty minutes.! The second half is ours.!
- Yo, motherfucker!
You missed that
block on purpose.
Hey, you full of shit!
You fumble, you try to blame me.
- All this shit is over Autumn.
- Fuck Autumn and fuck you!
You just can't take a hit,
punk.
Fucker!
- Hey, hey, hey!
I'll fuckin' kill your ass!
Break it up!
Come on,
let him go!
Get up!
Come here!
Come here! I don't wanna hear about who
started it. Save it for the field, understand?
- Do you understand me!
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, the rest
of you guys,
you play that second half
the way you did the first,
this is what the rest
of the seasors gonna look like.
- Don't ever let me see you miss a block again.
- Yeah, Coach.
Joe, warm yourself up,
you're startin' the second half.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, Joe.
Oh, Collins.
Yeah, Coach?
Get a mop and clean that mess up.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
E... S... U!
Ready to go with the second half
now. Wolves trailing ten-nothing.
We're told Joe Kane
will be starting at quarterback.
Listen up, now.! It's time to call
in the Wolves to piss on the fire.!
Let's go.! Let's go.!
Ready, break!
Kane calling signals.
Blue 80!
Hut!
Fumbles.
Griffen recovers.
Come on, Joe.
Green 25! Hut!
Kane looking forJefferson
in the flat.
Under-throws it badly.
Kane fading to pass.
Oooh.!
Hit and sacked.
And Kane's return
is a rocky one so far.
Joe's too tentative, too cautious
out there. He's flat, Sam. Maybe we...
- He's gonna be all right. He's gonna get his feel back.
- But we can't afford to...
I said, he's gonna
be all right.
5.;51 to go,
Georgia Tech up ten to nothing.
The Wolves are gonna have to
find some offense in a hurry here.
Their defense has been
keeping them in it.
Come on, Joe.
You're not lettin' it go, man.
Where's that wild man
that used to take charge of this team?
Hell, I know
you ain't lost that.
You are the only one
these guys are gonna follow.
It's time to sit
at the head of the table.
Let's forget rehab.
Forget your dad.
There's ten guys out there waiting
for you. It's your family now.
Look at me, boy.
We need ya.
We need ya.
You're the man, Joe.
Now you go out there
and you play like I know you can.
- Come on.
- Come on, Joe, let's go.
So let's see what the Wolves come up
with here as time continues to tick away.
We've held these guys up
long enough now.
All right, the masked man is back.
Hi-ho, fuckin' Silver!
Gimme some time back here and I'll pick
'em apart. Strong left, brown right,
60 pass, on three.
Ready, break!
Set!
Gray 22!
Hut!
Kane back to pass.
Good protection.
Throws to... Jefferson
on the sideline. He's got it...
and out ofbounds
at the Yellowjacket 32.
Hut!
Kane fades again.
Fires for Griffen.
Leaping catch at the 21 as the
Timberwolves are beginning to roll.
Kane... looks
into the end zone.
Can't find anybody.
Gonna run it.
Tucks the ball.
20...
15... ten.
Hit... and finally
brought down inside the five.!
Kane gets it to the four
where it'll be first and goal.
And there's no doubt about it,
with 3.;45 remaining,
they've gotta score here
if they wanna get back in this game.
Hey, Coach, give it to me up the gut.
They've been ignoring me. I can score.
- Not now, we're going with the sweep. 28 thunder right. Go.
- Go offense!
- Coach wants?
- L-right, 28 pitch.
All right. Thunder right,
28 pitch on one. Ready...
Break.!
On your left!
On your left!
Red 21!
Red 21!
Hut!
Kane pitches toJefferson...
sweeping thunder right.
Griffen, the lead blocker,
falls down.
Oh, shit.
Jefferson hemmed in
at the sideline.
- Tries to cut back.
- Now you're mine!
Whoa.! What a great block by Griffen.
Jefferson driving for the end zone.
Comin' at you! Come on!
Touchdown, Timberwolves.!
Yeah!
All right! Yes!
All right, baby,
we're back in it!
Hey...
nice block, man.
Hell of a run, rook.
Hell of a fuckin' run.
Let's take it to 'em, baby.
We're takin' it to 'em.
Okay, defense,
let's get even.
Let's kill 'em all.
Let the paramedics sort 'em out.
1.;11 and counting.
Third and one. The Wolves have to stop them on
this play if they're gonna get the ball back.
A first down and it's all she wrote.
ESU is out of time-outs.
All right, defense,
let's stuff'em one time for Alvin!
- Four-three stack. Ready, break!
- Yeah, yeah!
Georgia Tech over the ball.
Thom calling signals.
Eight-one-eight.!
Oh... yeah.
Hut!
- Hands off to Garrett.
- Aaa-aargh!
You're a dead man.!
Stops Garrett for a two-yard loss.
I don't think you got it, pal!
Ha-Ha!
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby!
And the Wolves will get the ball back.
Great individual effort by Lattimer.
All right.
Come here.
All right, guys,
here we go!
Georgia Tech in punt formation.
Here's the snap.
Langdom... puts
the foot to it.
- Jefferson... settles under it.
- Show time, baby.
Come on.
- Starts right.
- Bring it to me.
No place to go, reverses his field.
Comes back left.

Kane back to pass.
Forced out of the pocket.
Running right.
Kane on the run, fires.
Complete to Griffen
at the ten-yard line.
Out ofbounds stopping the clock
with seven seconds.
A field goal here
ties it,
but a tie may not get
the Wolves into a bowl game.
This'll be a tough decision
for Winters.
- What do ya think, go for the three?
- Just gimme the goddamn ball.
Brown right motion, tail slant.
You're the man, Joe.
We're about to win!
- You ready?
- Come on, baby, come on.

All right, everybody, now's the time.
Brown right motion, tailback slant.
Let's put the women and children to bed and

Thanks a lot.
I got somethin' for you.
It's my placement test.
I got an 89.
I believe

- I asked Coach Winters to look it up for me.
- I'll kill him.
Let's get outta here.
Hey, Coach.
Hey, Joe, that was a great throw.
Way to hang in there. I'm proud of you.
Thanks for everything.
Thanks for everything
you did for me.
Next year,
the Heisman, huh?
Well, uh...
Don't make an idiot outta me,
okay?
An amazing conclusion
to a great season.
We can see Steve Lattimer down on
the bench weeping tears of joy...
as ESU goes back to a bowl
for the first time in three years.
Hi.
What are you
doin' here?
Just waitin' for you.
I know I'm not your favorite
person in the world right now,
but um... I need your help
with something.
All the pressure's startin' again,
you know. All the Heisman talk and...
I just... I feel like I need to go out
and blow off some steam and I was...
I was just wondering if you'd...
go share a six-pack with me?
Tickets are in your bag. Player profiles,
itinerary, they're in the briefcase.
Now, we've got a 9 a. m. Tomorrow with
that uh... big linebacker from Park High.
From there we go to Atlanta. Need
to check out this defensive lineman.
He might be our replacement
for Lattimer next year.
