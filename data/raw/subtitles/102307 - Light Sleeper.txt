Labor Day weekend.
Some time for a garbage strike.
Everybody crazy to stock up.
They want to score at the last minute
and they want it now. Never fails.
The faces look alike.
You gotta use memory tricks:
each has some peculiarity.
It keeps you sharp.
A D. D. told me, when a drug dealer
starts writing a diary he should quit.
I started writing after that.
Not every night. Now and then.
Fill up one book,
throw it out, start another.
Darling!
- Ann...
Have we made New York
safe for another weekend?
Get a job. - Sad what 10 years
Got any hundreds?
- Twenties.
And some tens.
- Tens? - Goddamn cash machines!
Did what's-his-name give you
a hard time? - No. "CBD".
Fucking investment bankers!
"Cash Before Delivery. "
To these Wall Street kids cash
is like some theoretical concept.
I mean, we see'em at 2, right?
9 o'clock, I shudder to think,
they're buying and selling! It has
turned me off the stock market!
Tell me about it.
I've thought of investing many times
but it's just too damn crooked.
These people...
- It's late.
I gotta crash.
Or try, anyway. You stayin'?
It's over.
- It's okay? - Yeah, sure.
You look like you're coming down
with something. Take some C's. Go on.
I'll take care of anything
that comes in. - Thanks.
Sleep tight.
- Pick up the trash!
See you tomorrow.
- Big kiss.
"Labor Day".
"Union Movement".
There's a contradiction in terms.
I know about long hours.
It's worse when I'm off.
I just walk and walk.
There's an element of providence
to it all. Like rolling numbers.
Luck.
Some guy that looks a little like you
does a stick-up 4 hours ago.
A cop pulls you in because
he's cold and wants to go inside.
They grab your stash.
Your number's up.
You're busted for nothing.
For bad luck.
I like your jacket. - Thanks, man.
I got it in a trade. Is that it?
Are they "faced"?
- Don't bore me.
Is it so much work to face them? If
you don't do it, I got to. It's time.
You're too much. - We've been through
this. This 19-gram shit is a drag.
We pay you more, you put up with more.
White drugs for white people.
Twice the price, twice the safety.
I can't believe Ann's never been
busted. She's something.
Never made any big money either.
She blows it.
You believe that? What'll you do after
she quits? How long you been with her?
She's always saying that.
We'll see, Jealous.
She's out. You pick up her trade, man.
You're too old to be a go-fer.
No way.
I'm not the management type.
If I take charge,
I'll start using again.
It's not for me.
I know some music people.
I'm gonna get into recording.
Tour?
Yeah?
This wouldn't matter to you,
but you may get hassled.
Why? - Don't you read the papers, man?
The Park murder is all over the Post!
Mariah Rangel, 19-year-old Barnard
co-ed bitch, dead in Turtle Pond.
Coked to the fucking gills. Suddenly
they're hot after mid-level dealers.
You know her?
Who knows?
Thanks for the warning.
You pick up from Jealous? - Yeah,
I had to make 4 trips last night.
We're certainly not his favorite people.
- Well, we don't make the laws.
19 is carrying, 20 is dealing.
Let him be stupid!
He took my hundreds.
Take over for me a while.
I'm getting contact high. - P. P.?
Yeah. 7-3.
So who's Her Majesty talking to?
- The ecstasy connection from Arizona.
She's trying to get them
to come up here. Or better, Europe.
That's where the money is. - Yeah, all
mark-up. Could be the big one, Jack.
Don't dress.
You really think she means it
this time? - That's what she says.
New Year's Eve. She had her chart
done. New Year's Eve and out.
No Acid House,
no product, no delivery.
That's just her mouth talking.
- Next year: strictly "Akasha".
Cosmetics. That's what she's calling
the company now. - I don't get it.
Why would anyone want to pay
to put weeds on their face?
Why'd anyone pay
to put 'em up their nose?
Robert, you got a point there.
I like cosmetics.
I need cosmetics.
You should come in with us.
You forget she hasn't asked me.
Johnny! Robert!
Get your butts in here!
Coming!
Plant 2 big kisses on me, boys.
1, 500 Ex, 30 each
and the delivery is here!
Thanks. How do you like it? - Great!
- No, I mean the face cream.
Marigold, chamomile, almond, aloe, egg.
I remixed it. - Nice. - You like it?
Thanks. Which reminds me, get me some
almond oil but not the California.
What do we have to eat? - We haven't
had Thai in a while. - Indian!
Sweetheart, it's Saturday.
Thai...
I'm gonna start with "Mee Krob".
Ann, this is Ed... - Answer that,
he'll call back every 5 minutes.
The night begins.
Curry,
"Po Tak", the bouillabaisse is
awfully good. Or "Ped Srilom":
duck in plum and ginger sauce.
- I'm gonna go veggie. "Puk Ob".
That's not gonna be enough for you.
- Do you want "Puk Ob"?
You use it for facial cream.
- Remove unsightly hair!
You laugh! You're gonna be watching me
on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel.
Forgive us.
- All right.
Eddie wants "now".
- Now!
His place. Top Lady. God knows
what happened to his shit yesterday.
You take it. Check in. - I thought
we were supposed to be light tonight.
Don't you watch TV?
- I don't have one. - You don't?
Well, if you had a TV,
you'd know it's supposed to rain.
- It's good for the trees.
Some farmer whacked his numerology
on us. - Yep, it's starting!
Raining?
The Famers' Almanac is based
on numerology. - Take your jacket.
You better clean up the parlor
in time for dinner...
Le Tour! Finally! What took you
so long? - Traffic. It's raining.
How's things?
I need a quarter. You got it?
Robert sold you a quarter yesterday.
That was an eighth. Some friends
came over. How much is that?
1,400, right? Hey, you wanna buy this?
Eddie, sit down. Sit down!
I've known you how long?
8 years? Knew you from the other job.
The one before
the last one you fucked up.
I knew your wife. She was great.
We used to sit around and talk...
- You didn't know what she was like.
This is no good. You gotta cool it.
Go to bed, sleep it off.
I'll sell you a gram and some downs
but I won't put you in hospital.
You charge 200 bucks
for what goes for 90 on the street
and you're not gonna sell?
- So go out on the street!
I'll call Ann. - Go ahead. The phone's
over there. You know what she'll say.
I'll tell the fucking cops!
Fuck you. That's it. You're out.
- I'm sorry, Tour, I was kidding.
You were right. I'm quitting anyway.
I'll take the gram. I'm sorry.
You gonna cool it?
Go to bed, sleep it off?
You got downers?
200, right?
Where was I? All right,
so if there's no God,
then how can we conceive of him?
I mean, the idea of God
presupposes the existence of God.
That is the Ontological Argument.
That's Anselm. That's 1200 or 1400.
Don't leave, Tour, stay.
Listen, this is the good part.
If the idea of God
is implanted by God,
the "Sensus Divinitatus",
the sense of the divine, you know?
Then what is
the role of human thought?
Not faith. Thought.
Everybody wants to talk.
It's like a compulsion.
My philosophy is:
You got nothing to say? Don't say it.
They figure,
you can tell a D. D. anything.
Things they'd never tell anyone else.
Of course they're stoned to start.
Do you think that all of our thoughts
are on a prerecorded tape
and planted in our brain at birth?
I do.
Carlos,
pull over to the far left corner.
You see the woman with
the umbrella, with the trench coat?
You got it.
Marianne! Hop in.
I'll give you a ride.
John?
- Get in.
You're getting soaked.
Where are you going? You know,
I didn't know you still lived here.
Maybe this is... I should get out.
- No, don't be crazy! It's pouring!
I'm not supposed to be around...
- Former drug associates?
It's 4 years I'm clean.
There's no drugs, no alcohol, nothing.
I heard. I'm happy for you.
It's still not easy.
- I know.
You don't have to avoid me.
I'm straight. Yeah, 2 years now.
It just came that time. I tried
to tell you. I wrote. I called.
I should get out.
- Honest.
You're dealing.
- No, I stopped.
What's in the bag?
- Almond oil.
Go ahead, check!
Shit! - What's that for? In case
anyone needs almond oil late at night?
Okay, I deal a little.
But I'm straight. That part is true.
Stop the car. Right now. Stop it.
- I won't say any more. I promise.
I'll just sit here, give you a ride.
Right over here.
Bye, John.
83rd Street.
How did you hear about me?
- I don't know.
I just decided to come.
I look at you
and I give you my impressions.
I feel your vibrations.
I hate that word.
It sounds so phony, doesn't it?
But I can't think of anything better.
You're anxious.
More than usual.
Your livelihood is endangered.
You're worried about the future.
You don't have much money saved.
I see a woman who has betrayed you.
My mother?
Will betray you.
No, I don't think so.
- Keep it in mind.
I have a strong feeling about
this woman, a woman close to you.
She will betray you.
You're in the entertainment business,
aren't you? - Yeah.
But you're not happy there.
You want to do something else.
It's music, isn't it?
You're still drinking, aren't you?
You have a drinking problem?
- No, I don't think so.
I feel it's interfering with
your health and with your life too.
You've had other problems.
Drug addiction.
This was very important in your life.
Teresa, I'm 38 years old.
40.
- You're still young.
I have trouble sleeping.
Look. What are you seeing?
What is around me?
Is it dark?
Have I run out of luck?
Is there luck for me?
Everything you need is around you.
The only danger is inside you.
Love this machine.
- Amazing.
Excuse me.
- Sweetheart, your pay's on the table.
I'm happy to change
large bills for small, for 1 percent.
Is this the latest model?
I think another one just came out.
- You look like a doctor.
Same time?
- In 2 weeks. But don't go. Stay.
We'll order kosher.
I'll tell you dirty stories.
We'll talk Zionism.
I gotta go. I'm late already.
I only come here because I like you.
- Oh, please.
Are you sure you're not Jewish?
- What do you mean? My nails?
I don't want to see you get hurt.
- I'm fine.
You should do something else.
- Like what?
Like find a man. - God, you're so
Jewish! Of course you're Jewish!
Wait a minute, I have an idea,
how about investing in my cosmetics?
It's a great investment.
- Never mix business with friendship.
Just let me show you the prospectus.
- I gotta go, I'm sorry.
God bless you.
Don't eat any hotdogs!
See you in 2 weeks. - Goodbye.
Hello, this is Ann.
Please leave a message.
This is Karen...
Jealous mentioned a yuppie murder in
the Park. Heard about it? - Sure.
It's on the 5 o'clock news.
- He said to be careful. - We are.
We're too small time. Anyway,
she's not one of ours. Not directly.
Tis is at St. Luke's.
- What? What happened? - No big deal.
He's in the waiting room and he wants
one of us over there right away.
But can't it wait till he gets home?
Take it, will you? We have to stay
on his good side to set up Arizona.
Second floor waiting room.
You want to leave first?
You wanna have lunch
with me tomorrow?
Me?
One o'clock. "Côte Basque".
Too early for you?
No, I'll be there.
Doctor Shell,
please come to the emergency room.
Doctor Shell,
please come to the emergency room.
I couldn't find the place. - Thanks
for coming. - I came right away.
What's going on? - Got some valiums?
- Yeah, and 'ludes.
Just a valium. A ten.
What is it? - You won't believe it.
What a nightmare!
I brought in this chick.
She O. D.'d. I didn't even know her.
I didn't have to bring her in.
The cops're coming back to talk to me.
I'm hyper. I gotta come down. This
would never happen in Zurich. - Here.
Make it two.
Thanks.
Is she okay?
- Who? - The girl.
Yeah. Met her last night.
A walking vacuum cleaner.
What a nightmare. Underage.
- You need a lawyer?
He's here.
Thanks.
- Anytime.
Randi?
- Oh, my God! John!
Oh, my God. I can't believe it!
- It's good to see you.
Marianne's here too. She flew in.
What are you doing here?
Is there a problem?
Mom. She's back in. You didn't know?
Something serious?
- More chemo.
Can I see her? - She's sleeping.
She sleeps most of the time.
She'd like it though.
She still talks about you.
I'm so sorry.
Your Mom's a terrific woman.
I was always crazy about her.
It's John. What a coincidence.
Randi told me about your mother.
I'm so sorry. - Thanks.
She's sedated? - You know, she'd be
happy to see John, don't you think?
I'd like that.
- I don't think that's a good idea.
You both look tired.
One of us has to always be here.
- They let us stay in her room.
Could I buy you a cup of coffee? We
could go downstairs to the cafeteria.
You go. It's my turn with Mom.
- I shouldn't. - Yes, you should.
Go!
Black?
Kiss your mother for me.
You know it's gonna happen someday.
But when it does...
Your mother, that was a shock.
Has she been sick long?
- A year.
What about your father?
Not this time. His new wife.
He'll make it to the funeral.
What have you been doing?
Where do you live?
It's been...
I don't want you to know
about my life. - Anything?
You married?
You got kids? A dog? House plants?
Nothing?
Details just open the door.
- Open the door to what?
It's not like we're strangers,
after all. We were married.
We were not!
- There was a ceremony.
He wasn't even a minister.
He was an astrologer!
He was also a minister.
The Church of Universal Harmony.
He was a Pisces. - You're a Pisces!
- It wasn't legal.
In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're
married. - I was born on the cusp.
We were happy.
- We were miserable.
We were either scoring or coming down.
Mostly coming down.
We had good times.
Area.
Out on the street,
dancing with friends...
We were magical.
You took off for 3 months
without telling me and called once.
That's how magical we were.
You were an encyclopedia
of suicidal fantasies. Every one.
I mean, nobody
could clear a room like you, John.
And the friends, you may have noticed,
turned out to be mine, not yours.
I envy you. A convenient memory
is a gift from God.
You exaggerate.
In rehab it's called
"Euphoric Recall"... - We were happy.
I was drowning.
- It wasn't me.
You did nothing. I wasn't your
business. You still think like that.
Actions have consequences.
So do inactions.
I meant well.
You always meant well.
We were in love.
We were happy.
You bought it for me.
It's inscribed inside.
Ann's quitting,
I've gotta find something else to do.
I'll believe it when I see it.
- No, it's true.
Are you really straight?
Yes.
- Let me see your eyes.
Eyes are deceiving.
Congratulations.
If I could do that, I could do
anything. - What does that mean?
We could do anything.
We could start all over again.
I have to get back.
- You didn't touch your salad!
Okay, I'll walk you back.
May I help you, sir?
What's on for tonight?
- Just some party.
Have fun. I gotta get going.
- See you soon. - Bye-bye.
I can always find
another way to make a living.
I never planned this
in the first place. Not like Ann.
She came up to sell,
have parties, make contacts.
She was glamorous.
I just wanted to be around her.
She'd sit up
listening to coke stories.
Now it's me and Robert.
The whole crowd was the same
age then. Everybody's younger now.
She made me.
You have any money saved?
- There's some. One or two thousand.
Maybe more. - What do you do with all
your money? - It's not that much,
as you know.
- It's tax free.
The rent, Con Ed, phone, CD's...
tips, just clothes, regular stuff.
How about your money?
Kitty Ford said: "The only person who
lives better than you is my Grandma!"
I don't know.
All the money I make I spend.
It just never adds up.
And then the last 2 years this
cosmetics thing has taken everything.
I wish I could help.
You still going to meetings?
- No, but I'm okay.
What are the odds of meeting someone
that you haven't seen in years
twice in 2 days?
If it's indicated in your house
of relationships, it's pretty high.
You should have Robert do your chart.
Who is the person?
- Just a contact. You don't know him.
So what's the plan?
What? The plan?
The future. - My future?
- Why? Is that too conceptual for you?
We had this conversation 2 years ago.
We're gonna have it again in 2 years.
No, this time it's for real.
I'm thinking about taking some music
courses. Sound editing, mixing...
Didn't you already do that?
- No, that was acting.
No. That was modeling.
Yeah, you're right. I guess it was.
You should try these berries.
They're flown in from someplace.
Everything's flown in from someplace.
- Ann,
is there something you want to say?
What's up?
I guess I'm a little worried.
Everybody thinks I'm so tough.
And you gotta be tough.
Especially in this business.
It's one thing to look tough,
it's another to...
I've seen Zipporah twice this week.
Did she help you?
- She harmonizes and she...
She's encouraging me to shift from,
you know, to the cosmetics thing.
But if it doesn't work, is she gonna
pay for these berries? - Montrachet?
It's a cash world!
I know what I'm gonna do.
Maybe you should see Zipporah.
No, I'm not into that stuff.
- What stuff?
He's a big producer.
Nominated for an Academy Award.
Best Picture.
I used to know every girl he fucked.
Who, how. He couldn't take a shit...
We were like this.
His wife told him to get straight
or else she'd cut him off. Old money.
I remember
the last thing he said to me:
"We'll keep in touch. " Right.
That was 5 years ago.
Thanks.
You'll still talk to me won't you?
- You?
Of course I will.
It's gonna be so weird
without you around.
It kinda just hit me.
We'll always have Paris.
Ann, you want me, just call.
Write a letter, tell a wino,
I'll be there.
I'm sorry.
I always thought
my father would die first.
He would die, and then my mother and I
could reconcile. - It's like a joke.
It's not a real feeling.
- My old man bawling in the hospital,
me popping in and out of the john
getting loaded.
I miss you.
You tried to kill me.
You took 10 years off my life,
one way or another.
I couldn't hate my mother.
I was too busy hating you.
I thought I was just killing myself.
Selfish.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Excuse us.
Let's go.
Come with me.
Have you ever had sex
totally straight?
Not with you.
That's quite an erection!
I never had anything like it stoned.
It's weird.
I'm dripping.
Let's disappear.
You gotta go back?
This is the end.
It was wonderful
and I'm glad it happened this way.
It will never happen again.
You will not call me.
You will not see me again.
I'm happy for you.
I wish you the best.
I'm leaving. I shouldn't have left
the hospital, but I don't regret it.
Please get dressed and leave
as soon as you can. I have a key. Bye.
It's my fault.
I love you.
Johnny, what is this?
Your beeper broke?
You getting Shiatsu?
2 hours! Where the fuck have you been?
There was a mix-up. - How the hell
are you going to survive on your own?
The UN has some conference in 2 days.
The holiday is over.
Peacemakers all over the place trying
to score. UN security at every hotel.
Even I have been out. Okay?
Look, this is where our business is:
Europe, Asia, not the fucking streets!
But you wouldn't know crack
from Cracker Jacks.
Where's Robert? - He's out
busting his ass doing your job!
It was a confusion.
- Well, get confused on your day off!
And when is that? - Don't get wise
with me! What do you want me to do?
Suck your dick? Fine!
You want a raise? Forget it!
John, come here.
Here are the call-ins.
Get your ass out of here
before I kiss it!
I'm sorry.
Le Tour! Take a rest.
You know Thomas. This is Gabri.
Tasha. And I don't know who he is.
How did it work out?
- What? - Saint Luke's.
No problem.
Can you believe it? She's out of the
hospital 1 day, wants to get together.
Some people are just born for losing.
You want to go in the back?
Not now. Look at the bar.
Dark-haired guy,
late twenties, brown suit.
He's casing you.
Undercover, whatever. He's on you.
You been a bad boy?
- Fucking Nazis!
You know him?
- Just a feeling.
Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway.
Make it tomorrow. A half,
no, 3 quarters. - 19 is the top.
I can make 2 trips.
- 19 is fine.
Okay, "a domani"! See you.
- Take care girls. Ciao!
I feel my life turning.
All it needed was direction.
You drift from day to day,
years go by.
Then a change comes.
I am able to change.
I can be a good person.
What a strange thing
to happen halfway through your life.
What luck.
Paramount Hotel.
- Marianne Jost, please.
Just a moment.
Welcome to the Paramount.
Your party is out.
If you'd like to leave a message
for... - Marianne Jost.
...please do so after the beep.
Paramount Hotel.
- Marianne Jost, please.
Just a moment.
Welcome to the Paramount.
Your party is out.
If you'd like to leave a message
for... - Marianne Jost.
...please do so after the beep.
Are you looking at me?
- No.
Can I help you, Officer?
- What?
I'm not making a mistake.
You are a cop, aren't you?
Can I see your badge?
Bill Guidone.
- What is it?
You think you're invisible, don't you?
You think we don't know you, Le Tour?
That's the name you use, right?
My father's a partner
in a very powerful law firm.
If you have anything in mind,
do it by the book.
Who the fuck gives a shit about you?
I could grind you right here.
In fact, maybe I will.
What do you think about that?
Nobody would give a flying fuck.
I look like narcotics? I'm homicide,
investigating the murder in the park.
I don't read the papers.
Downtown's interested how a
19-year-old student with fancy parents
got a quarter of uncut coke on her
when she was found murdered.
This ain't the type of girl we find
cruising Alphabet City to score.
Know what I mean? Somebody sold her.
Somebody upscale. You're classy.
So I hear.
And maybe somebody knows
something we need to know.
You understand?
Delivery boy!
Here's my card. You ask around.
Take a week or so. Call me.
Tell me something
I don't already know.
It's either that, leave town,
or get your ass busted
day in, day out.
Got it?
Loser!
Paramount Hotel.
- Marianne Jost.
Just a moment. I'm sorry,
Miss Jost checked out this morning.
Did she leave a forwarding number?
No, she didn't.
Thanks.
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.
- Mrs. Joanne Jost. She's a patient.
Just a moment.
Who is this calling?
Skyline Floral.
We're checking on a delivery.
Mrs. Jost passed away last night.
Are the funeral arrangements local?
- Just a second.
Yes, Plaza Memorial.
- Plaza Memorial. Thank you.
Get out!
Every time you come into my life
something terrible happens.
I thought I was rid of you.
What are you...? How did you...?
I don't want you here!
I don't want you around!
I don't want you around my mother!
Damn you! Just get out!
Get the fuck out of my life!
Get out! Get out of here!
I'm sorry, John. You shouldn't
have come. That's the way it is.
She's been up all night crying. She
wasn't there when mother passed...
...died. She blames herself.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
She just slipped away.
Marianne's... I'm worried about her.
- What do you give a shit about?
God. Okay.
It's...
- Don't try.
How are you?
- Me? - Yeah, you.
I can't think of anything, but if
there's anything I can do. - I'm okay.
We've been expecting it.
It'll hit me later.
I saw her.
- Who?
Your mother. I came into the room.
You were sleeping.
Well, I gotta get back because
Marianne's probably flipping out.
Sweetheart! "Shu Mai" just delivered.
It's fabulous! Have a snack with us.
No, thanks.
I told Ann you'd be on time.
Tis called. He said before 10.
He said you were right. - About what?
Undercover cop, not a narc.
The Park murder. Jealous was straight
on that. Hear anything more about it?
Remember the time that cop came here?
Wanted to know if we had "nose candy"?
And Ann says: "John Candy?"
What's wrong, Baby?
You look like shit. Something's wrong.
No, no, it's nothing.
- You can't fool me. I can read you.
There's nothing to say.
You're leaving me.
After a few more months:
"Sayonara!" You too.
John who? What the hell was his name?
It's not like I got a pension plan.
Is that what you think?
You hate cosmetics!
I know... - Who knows what'll happen?
- I got a friend. A D. D.
Got into lapidary. I'll introduce you.
- What the hell is he talking about?
Gems!
Crystals, diamonds...
- Anything more about the Park murder?
What is it with this?
- Stay away!
If you want to come in with us, fine!
We can make room.
It's no big deal. There's room.
- It's not what I want.
Well, that's what I said.
- This is Ed. You gotta come...
Damn it! Don't answer it! I don't want
to deal with it. - I'll handle it.
If he gives you any shit, fuck him!
- I'm sorry. - Forget it.
Don't forget about Tis.
Ann needs that contact.
- Give it a rest.
Eddie, come on!
- Fuck you, you scum!
Fuck you!
- You low life dealer!
Personally, I don't give a shit.
You can go kill yourself.
I don't care. But you O. D. in here,
it's a problem for me.
I put a hex on you, man!
- Fuck you! - Fuck you!
What are you doing? Gotta get
permission? Gotta check with Mama?
No, I'm calling your brother.
The lawyer up in Bronxville.
I'm gonna tell him to come here.
You told me so much about him.
Tour, you can't do this. Please!
I'll give you anything! Money...
Martin Jeer, please. Thanks.
- He doesn't understand!
I recommend Hazelton. It has the best
program. - Why are you doing this?
You're such an asshole! - Martin Jeer?
I'm here with your brother Ed.
There's been a medical emergency.
You're gonna have to come.
Yeah, he'll be here.
Good evening. - Good evening, sir.
- I'm here to see Tis Bruge.
Your name, sir?
John Le Tour.
A mister John Le Tour
is here to see you, sir. Certainly.
Penthouse, sir.
- Thank you.
Tour!
- Thomas!
Evening, Tis. - Just in time.
We were out. 19, right?
That's 38, right?
You got any hundreds? - Some. Not
the whole thing. - You got hundreds?
I like that about Ann.
Always takes the time to grind it.
If you're going to do it,
do it right.
Looks like you could use some help.
Mari, this is Tour.
You got any hundreds?
Not the talkative type.
Haven't seen her for years.
You know her, don't you?
Why they call me...
What a nightmare!
You want it or not?
- Yeah.
See you later?
Tell Ann I made that phone call
for her. It's all set up.
Marianne?
Where to?
What?
Where to, sir? Where are we going?
Nowhere just yet.
Let's just wait.
You want to wait here?
Downtown.
Yes, sir.
All news, all the time.
This is 1010 WINS.
You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.
Here's what's happening:
Seven people made off with 600, 000
dollars from the city program meant
to renovate old buildings. The money
renovated their bank accounts instead.
More arrest warrants may be issued.
And this just in:
A woman has fallen to her death.
Police are withholding identification.
The incident happened about 10 p. m.
According to the sources on the scene
there was no one else in the exclusive
Grace Towers apartment at the time.
Is the sanitation strike over?
A successful conclusion
of the negotiations is imminent.
Who is it?
- It's John Le Tour.
Can I see you? - What time is it?
- It's important, Theresa.
You should call. Make an appointment.
- Open the door. You're up anyway.
Do I know you?
- We had a session last week.
What do you see?
Look at me.
What do you see?
Okay, just a minute.
I see death.
- Someone I knew died tonight.
This was not an accident. This person
was murdered. - Am I in danger?
The danger's around you.
It's very close.
God, I'm tired.
- What should I do?
I don't know. I can't see it.
- Please.
Is this it?
Has my luck run out?
No.
No, you're fine.
Don't be afraid. Come on, go home.
What do I owe you? - Nothing.
Forget it. Just let me sleep.
You're fine.
Ninth precinct.
- Bill Guidone, homicide.
Guidone.
- This is John Le Tour. Remember me?
Yeah, laundromat.
Your father's got big connections.
You told me to tell you something you
didn't know. It ain't much, but still.
A girl died last night. Lexington
Avenue. - Yeah, the jumper. Druggie.
The news said she was alone,
but she wasn't. It's a cover-up.
There was someone else there.
- Who?
Who owns the apartment?
You there?
That's all I know. You told me to tell
you something. I told you something.
Manny!
Le Tour. Jealous, "Jell". SOB's.
Burning Spear.
How did you get in?
- C.C.
You buying?
- How's product?
How much?
No, I got a problem. I need a piece.
Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy?
A gun. - When?
- Now, anything.
Am I talking too fast?
How much you spend?
- The rate.
What've you got?
We got trade. Detective Special.
Nobody wants 'em. Got it from a cop.
How much?
Four, including me.
- You're fucking me! - So what?
Where is it?
Come on.
The hundreds. Franklins.
How do I use this thing?
It's a gun, man! - Yeah, but is there
something special I gotta know?
I've never used one of these before.
How do you do it? - Simple.
Put the bullets in. Point it at the
bad guys. Pull the trigger. They fall.
Are you okay?
Did you go to the police station?
- She was back on drugs.
Really back.
They're gonna bring her here too.
I thought she was playing
for attention. - I didn't know.
You're not to blame.
You're not responsible.
Look.
Recognize anyone?
- That's Tis. - You know him?
His father's a lawyer. He did Mom's
taxes. He was at the hospital.
What is that smell?
- It's me. Cologne.
I'm a sucker
for that cheap airplane-stuff.
Did she mention him yesterday?
- It was his apartment. Why?
I don't know.
- She jumped.
I know you loved her, but...
I know this is gonna sound terrible,
but she was... she ruined everything!
Bad luck.
Sorry about last night.
Our prodigal son!
- Something came up. T.C.T.E.
T.C. what? - "Too Complicated
To Explain". I gotta show you this.
I'm 400 short from last night.
You can take it out of my pay.
Look, this is family. Do you want to
hurt my feelings? It's not money.
We had a graphic artist make it up.
You know Billy. Five Towns.
Oh, sure. Classy! Very Katmandu.
- Kath-mandu! - Whatever.
Well, it's good. I like it. It's nice.
Tis called twice. He wants you
to come by. - I don't want to go.
The suicide and all.
I think we should stay away.
Can't. He's the connect. I don't
wanna fuck with this. - Oh, come on.
Johnny, it's business.
Let Robert go. - Tis doesn't deal
with fags. - Since when?
Since always. So he's a bigot!
So what? So's everybody!
I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe.
He said you.
Why?
You go. He's your contact.
He is.
- You giving orders? - No, Missy.
Come with me. The two of us.
Sure.
Why not?
For old times' sake. Ann and Johnny.
Stop it!
You're breaking my heart.
Robert, call the car.
It's gonna be strange not doing this.
I've had it, I'm fed up, but...
You're really gonna do it? You're
really gonna quit? - I think so.
I'll seal this thing with Tis, turn it
over and put everything in cosmetics.
You gotta take chances in life.
No risk, no gain, as they say.
Anyway, I've got my retail connections
here and in Europe.
It was great when
we started out, though, wasn't it?
Greene Street years.
Before deliveries.
When you were still using.
I should write a book.
Did It tell you somebody asked
actually to ghostwrite my story?
But...
My lawyer freaked. I even took the
meeting. Of course it was impossible.
Everybody thinks
I've got such a glamorous life.
But they don't know.
I mean, you know. Glamorous, yeah.
It was, actually. Once, before
crack came and fucked everything.
I gotta stop at my place for a second.
It's out of the way. You're expected.
- I got a bad vibe about Tis.
Chill on this, will you? It's routine.
- I wanna get my lucky jacket.
Did you douche while you were
at it? - You got some mouth on you!
You don't want to know
where it's been.
You got cologne on? Smells like the
stuff on airplanes. - It's for you.
Don't use it. It's got chemicals
in it. It's terrible for the skin.
What are you doing?
Do me a favor. - What?
- Don't ask why. Promise?
Promise?
- What?
If anything should happen to me
write her and tell her.
She's my sister.
Her husband's in San Quentin.
She worries.
I thought we were going to Tis'.
He's here. You can't expect him to be
at his apartment after what happened.
Mathis Bruge, please.
Tis? This is Ann.
Yeah, I'm here with Tour.
Tis there?
Voilà!
So where's Tis?
Ann.
I told you greasy fucks, no guns!
When I see a fucking gun, I walk!
How fucking dare you? I don't know
who you are, but kiss my fat ass!
Tis, you shitball!
Where are you? I know you're in there.
Goddamn it! If you want to deal with
me, you owe me a fucking apology.
Let's go.
- Hold it. Stop right there!
No.
Sorry about the guns. - What the fuck
are you doing this macho shit for?
For emphasis. To make a point.
- Oh, please! - My fuck up.
I apologize.
Assholes. - Really?
- What a nightmare!
We'll take care
of that thing tomorrow. Same terms.
Sorry.
Go on, leave. You're upset. I just
need to talk to Tour about the police.
Tour and I
need to get our stories straight.
Somebody's talking to the police.
I'm sorry, Ann.
I just have to talk to Tis.
Go down. I'll meet you at the car.
We came together,
we're leaving together. Come on.
Thomas.
Don't be stupid. Get out! Leave!
I had nothing to do with Marianne.
She jumped.
She was there and she was gone.
Nothing will happen to Tour.
Go on, Ann.
Fire!
Don't be crazy.
Stop now. Stop, please.
Believe me.
I...
I didn't have anything to do with...
Teal.
Jones.
And Le Tour.
We got 20 minutes.
You look terrific.
- I look respectable.
So what's the news?
Sentencing's
supposed to be in 10 days.
Because of circumstances and our
cooperation, no more than 5 years.
Maybe 7.
It hasn't been so bad.
It's a relief in a way. So far.
I've been writing.
And reading.
- I love your letters.
Good. - I didn't know
you could write like that.
How's business?
Is it still "Akasha"?
- It's still "Akasha".
Robert quit. He went back to dealing.
I guess he thought
he'd make more money and work less.
It's lucky I'm involved in the
enquiry because now I have to quit.
It's cosmetics after all.
Did we ever fuck?
What?
You know, make love?
There was the Christmas party.
Everybody got so stoned...
No.
You crashed at my place once and we
slept together. - We were naked?
But?
We tried.
I was thinking about it
and I realized we never really did.
It's one of the things I think about.
One of the things I look forward to.
I've been looking forward.
Me, too.
Strange how things work.
