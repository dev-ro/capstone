(Church bells peal)
(Guide) Watch your step.
Watch your step, please.
Hispanic Tours, this way, please.
Follow my hand.
- No, no, no.
- The usual postcards! (Laughs)
- Photos, photos.
- No, thanks. I'll take my own.
Follow me.
This way. This way, please!
(All chatter)
All right.
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
Keeping close, please.
Come along, move in close, please.
Here we have,
ladies and gentlemen,
a unique example
of Medieval Christian art.
This representation of the devil
carrying off the dead,
goes far beyond
the formalized art of its day.
Look closely.
The face of Satan expresses a quality,
which reflects the very soul
of pleasure in evil.
The devil seems a presence
so strong and overpowering,
that this painting has led
to a local superstition.
The people of this region believe that
it is only the power of the devil himself,
which has kept this fresco from ruin.
- Listen, I'll be right back, OK?
- Lisa, where are you going?
- Wait for me there, all right?
- Yeah, well, hurry back.
(Guide) ...balanced between the figures
of the living and of the dead.
(♪ Distant music box plays)
(♪ Music box plays)
(Man) Hm, the eyes, Maestro.
(Shopkeeper) Sí, señor?
(Man) I would add a few wrinkles
and age them a bit more, hm?
- His attire, Maestro.
- Hm?
A bit severe, isn't it?
Well, I think this black here
would be better, you know,
because then you could use it
on all occasions -
for funerals, weddings,
whenever you like.
- Hm, you have a point.
- Oh, I'll trim the mustache a little.
(clears throat) Excuse me,
but how much are you asking for this?
It's not for sale.
It belongs to the gentleman here.
Oh.
(Man) Up we go! (Chuckles)
(Man) Do you think black
is too severe, Miss?
(♪ Music box continues to pay)
(Man) Strange, how strange.
You'd think the girl had seen the devil!
Excuse me, sir, could you tell me...
No, wait!
Sir, the main square...
Señora!
Excuse me, señora, but I'm Lost.
Can you tell me where the main square is?
(Asks for directions in simple Spanish)
(Cackling Laughter)
(Man approaches, speaks)
brain and mouth agape.
You're a dummy, is what you are.
(Chuckles)
Ah, is she the Lady
we met in the shop?
- Hello, Miss.
- Excuse me, I... I... I'm Lost.
Can you... Can you tell me
where the main square is?
- (Gasps)
- Come back here! (Chuckles)
Excuse me.
The square, what square?
Well, the one...
Well, the one where the painting is,
the, er, fresco of the devil
carrying away the dead.
Ah!
That way.
Good day, Miss.
Good day.
(Mumbles)
Darling!
- Elena.
- (Whimpers softy)
Why do you Look at me like that?
- No...
- You knew that I'd come back to you,
- that someday we'd find each other again.
- No, don't...
You must have known
that I would have come back.
- No! No!
- No, Elena!
- Let me go! No!
- (Screams)
(clattering)
Help!
He... help!
(Car approaches)
Hey!
(Man) What is it now?
(Driver) I don't know, sir.
(Man) You're a chauffeur...
(Driver) Yes, sir.
I'm not a mechanical engineer.
(Woman) Must you use that tone?
(Man) please!
- please, open! please!
- (Man) What's the matter?
Excuse me, but I'm a tourist,
and I've Lost my way.
(Man) All right...
- (Man) George!
- Yes?
(Man) We'll give this young Lady a lift.
(George) We will if we can get started.
(Man) May I know
what's wrong with the car?
It's the upper hose. It's Losing water, sir.
It should be repaired.
Let's go on.
(Engine rattles)
(Man) Why are you slowing down?
(George) It's not me, it's the car, sir.
(Man) Listen, George, do you have to stop
right here in the middle of nowhere?
It's not up to me, sir.
If it's boiling over, we can't go much
further, not without burning out the motor.
(Woman) You and your foreign cars.
What do we do now? Wait for parts
to come in from the factory?
(Man) Stop that, will you?
How do you open these?
George?
- (George) Madam.
- Next time, listen to me.
(Woman) Thank you, George.
(George) Madam.
(Woman) How Long will it take?
(George) If we had a hose, a few minutes.
(Woman) Can't you fix it?
(George) I could try.
(Woman) please, George.
(Door creaks)
(Man) Oh, er, good evening. I, er...
I'm very sorry to bother you
but we've had some trouble with the car.
The water hose is Leaking
and we'll need a mechanic.
(Woman) Leandro!
(Man) I reallse it's Late,
but if we could use your phone
and get in touch with a garage...
(Woman) Leandro!
I'm sorry, there is no telephone here.
We have so little use for it, you see.
- (Woman) Send them away!
- Yes, my Lady, certainty!
(Man) Is there a hotel nearby?
(Leandro)
No, not in the immediate vicinity.
Oh, there are a few roadside inns,
but their accommodations
would hardy meet with your approval.
(Man) I see.
(Gasps)
(Woman shouts in distance)
(Leandro) Coming, my Lady!
(Woman) Oh, this is awful.
(Man) Yes, it's a dreadful night.
Please stay.
Don't go away.
(Man) Where could we find
one of these roadside inns?
No, no, no, please, don't go away.
My mother's not used to visitors.
We live atone.
But please, please come in.
(Woman) Maximilian,
what's keeping you?
Excuse me, I'll... only be a moment.
Mother.
Tell them to go,
Maximilian, dear, listen to me.
W... we're always so atone.
It'll only be for one night.
Mother, please.
She...
They've no place to go.
Only for one night.
- Very well, if you wish.
- Oh, thank you, Mother.
Max... not in here.
Show them to the cottage.
(Frogs croak)
It's just ahead.
A few more strides...
- Thank goodness for that!
- Sophia!
Well, we could at Least tell George
where we're going.
Would you care for a Lollipop?
You know, the villa’s a bit run-down,
but I'm sure the cottage will be suitable.
Besides, even the Countess
would prefer it. Miss...
- Erm, you and I earller this evening, yes?
- I...
I mean, you were lost
and asked for directions.
- You do remember, don't you?
- No.
I do most of the shopping
for the Countess and I'm often in town.
And very llttle escapes me,
if you know what I mean.
(Woman) Well, are we supposed
to stand here all night?
- (Man) Listen there, where is this place?
- Excuse me.
Come, please. Come this way.
(Leandro hums)
(Woman) Oh, it's so sllppery.
(Leandro) There's a bit of moss here...
and there...
and everywhere. (Laughs)
(Woman) What's the matter with him?
(Leandro) Come, Miss!
(Engine rattles)
This way.
Here we go.
Straight on.
That's it. Excellent!
Excellent!
(Creaking)
- (Gasps)
- (Clock chimes)
(clock chimes)
- Now, where's your husband?
- Guess!
Oh!
Taking his bath.
The first thing he did
was to go look for a tub. (Chuckles)
No need to worry.
He knows about us.
He's not bllnd.
It's just that he doesn't care.
Don't look llke that.
Hm?
(Man whispers) I love you.
(Gasps)
(Rattllng)
(Gasps)
(Screams)
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
What frightened you so?
That's only Leandro.
(Leandro) Messy... dummy!
(Woman) No, no, no, it...
(Woman) It wasn't Leandro, it was...
(Maximllian) Oh, he was carrying a dummy.
- Oh, it was awful!
- The vllla's full of them. They're harmless.
Don't cry.
Don't!
This is such a gloomy house.
We're so alone.
You can't imagine how...
how happy I am now that you're back.
Back?
This is the last rose of the season.
It llngered on and waited for you.
If only you would stay!
Don't go away.
(Woman) I... I don't even know you.
(Maximllian) Everything's so different
with you here.
I feel allve and happy.
(Woman) But...
(Maximllian) Don't say no. please!
(Woman) Maximllian!
Is that you there?
Yes, Mother!
Excuse me, I have to go now.
I'll see you at dinner.
(Leandro hums)
Good evening,
Mr Rabbit, or is it Mr Hare?
Would you care for a radish? No?
They're very good. (Hums)
(Max) I'm very pleased you decided
to accept our invitation. Thank you.
(Sophia) Thank you.
(Man) Yes, thank you.
(Man) Our intrusion wasn't very timely.
(Max) Oh, no, no, no.
You're most welcome.
Our mother's not used to visitors.
She was a bit frightened, that's all.
It was all so unexpected.
You understand.
- Yes, of course.
- (Max) So thrllllng.
(Sophia) Thrllllng?
(Max) You must be tired.
Was it a long trip?
That depends on the starting point,
I wouldn't know how to answer that.
- (Max) Oh?
- I never plan things that far ahead.
I certainly envy you.
A new horizon emerges for you each day.
My world, instead, is the very
configuration of this vllla. I...
(Max) Mother! Oh, excuse me.
I'm so glad you came down.
Thank you, Mother.
Good evening.
Leandro, I would llke to be introduced
to our guests.
I'm Francis Lehar.
My wife Sophia and I wish to thank you
for your kind assistance.
(Leandro) That wlll suffice, thank you.
Your Ladyship,
may I present Mr and Mrs Francis Lehar.
And may I also present Miss, er...
Miss, er...
Lisa. Lisa Reiner.
Miss Lisa Reiner.
- please be seated.
- Thank you, Your Ladyship.
Our guest Mr Lehar was telling us
just before you arrived, Mother,
of his journeys. He has the world
in the palm of his hand, it would seem.
- (Francis chuckles)
- Where's the other person?
Other person?
You must mean the chauffeur.
- He's outside.
- No, not the chauffeur, dear.
I mean the fifth person
who came here this evening.
Mother, belleve me...
Maximllian, dear,
you haven't forgotten him, have you?
It's so easy to imagine
a mysterious visitor in this house.
Yes, thank you.
- Rare! Very rare!
- Mm-hmm!
The entire setting is so right
for a tall tale of gloom and perdition.
(Chuckles nervously)
We could make one up
as we go along.
We have the right ingredients.
The dark night.
This house.
It's all so... so spooky.
Don't you find, Your Ladyship?
I prefer ghosts to vampires, though.
They're so much more human.
They have a tradition to llve up to.
Somehow they manage to keep all the
horror in without spllllng any blood.
(Clattering)
(Footsteps)
(Floorboards creak)
(Footsteps continue)
(Banging)
(Max) Mother, please!
Mother, llsten to me, please.
You're tired.
(Woman) What's wrong, Maximllian?
(Max) Nothing. Don't worry.
- I told you he'd be back.
- Mother...
I...
I was not introduced
to the fifth guest, Maximllian.
- (Smashing)
- (Sophia gasps)
(Chuckles)
please! Excuse me, but I...
I'll only be a moment.
Do continue, please.
I have to...
Leandro, the cake.
- It's with chocolate sprinkles.
- Thank you.
Leandro, perhaps our guests would llke
some cake also. It's quite good.
Please continue.
I... I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
(Walling)
I brought you some cake.
It's your favourite.
With chocolate sprinkles.
Did you know he was back?
You mustn't see him.
You must send him away.
I wlll not let him
come between us again.
He's caused enough anguish.
He'll never enter this room!
You've nothing to say?
- You're not asleep.
- (Moaning)
You can pretend if you llke.
But you'll never leave this room!
(Walling)
Do you hear me?
Never! Never.
- That should do it.
- (Leandro) You'll be leaving at once?
Uh-huh.
(Leandro) Quite adept
with these mechanical toys, aren't you?
So-so.
Thanks for the...
Oh!
You're over there.
Thanks for the tape.
Could you tell the others to get ready?
I'll be through here in a minute.
- Of course.
- Thanks.
That didn't take much, did it?
(George) No, just a lot of tape.
Most things aren't that easy to mend.
How could you come back?
After what you've done to us!
Mother...
Mother was certain that you'd return.
She was certain.
But I never thought
you'd have the courage.
Why did you have to come back now?
Just when I found happiness.
I won't let you destroy everything.
You can't take her away again!
Where are you?
How can I stop you...
when I can't even see you?
Where are you, you coward?
Show yourself!
Oh, finally!
This is so nerve-wracking.
Lisa, we're leaving
as soon as the car is ready
but we'd be glad to take you if...
Oh, erm... I don't think our young lady
wlll be going with you.
Master Maximllian has asked her to stay.
Come.
Come closer, girl.
The eyes, Leandro.
What colour are the eyes?
Changeable, my lady.
But by candlellght...
blue.
She's bllnd.
My God!
And the hair, Leandro?
Tell me of it.
Tell me of the hair.
Light, my lady, and gently flowing.
Golden llke a field of wheat?
No, my lady, brighter stlll.
And haloing
an equally beautiful countenance.
Oh, she's a very lovely creature,
my lady.
You wouldn't llsten
when I told you to stay away.
Now it's too late.
Frank, this is ridiculous.
(Sighs)
I'm going out of my mind, Frank.
These people are all crazy.
What's happened to George?
What's going on?
Where's George gone, dear?
To fix the car!
Calm down, wlll you?
Calm down!
All right. I'll go out and take a look.
And you calm down!
(Engine revving)
(Car klaxon)
Oh, it's about time!
(♪ Music box plays)
Hm?
I find that invariably, Miss Lisa...
there's a very simple explanation
for almost everything.
Don't you agree?
(Car horn)
(♪ Romantic music plays)
It's cold...
- ...you're trembllng, darllng.
- Oh, Carlos.
When I saw you, I...
I had to come back
and help you in some way.
To give you llfe and happiness.
Oh, Carlos, my love!
I love you, Carlos!
(Moans)
Carlos, I love you.
Carlos, oh...
Don't leave me, please.
The thought of losing you
fllls me with such sadness.
I don't dare think of it.
Oh, my love, you're back!
I've waited so long for you.
No!
George?
George!
Where are you?
George?
George!
Oh, where did he go?
George!
- (Francis) What's the matter?
- Oh, Geor...
- Where have you been? Did you find him?
- Obviously not.
Your concern for our chauffeur
is almost touching.
Where are you going?
If this is your way of being a man,
Frank...
- ...I'm very unimpressed.
- You slut.
Let go of me!
(Sophia screams)
(Sophia weeps)
Why?
(Sobbing)
(Continues to sob)
Oh...
(Sobs)
We must go to notify the pollce.
No, we don't want
anyone coming now.
It's all so horrible.
To think Mother predicted it...
We mustn't call them.
They'll pry into our llves, and...
And I'll be gullty.
It's not always wise to stir up the past.
We all have some unforgivable secret.
Sarah, let us leave well enough alone.
Careful!
Your mother imagined there being
someone else in the house.
If we haven't seen them,
there must be a reason, don't you think?
If you would take my humble advice,
Mr Lehar,
it wlll be best to leave at once.
Oh, yes. I understand.
Would you say my chauffeur discovered
something he wasn't supposed to?
Who knows?
We all have enemies, Mr Lehar.
And what better place
to get rid of someone undesirable?
Undesirable?
Why?
- What enemies are there in here?
- Hm.
But not to worry.
All you have to do is go
and leave the corpse to us.
Now, Mr Lehar, can I trouble you
for a cigarette?
- Oh, yes.
- Hm.
- Leandro!
- (Leandro coughs)
Excuse me, sir, would you mind
putting out those cigarettes?
The smoke bothers the Contessa.
- You called, my lady?
- Where is my son?
Is he with the girl?
I don't know.
Get rid of her.
We must send her away.
Oh, Lisa.
What good is it to hope for the future
when solltude is all that awaits you?
What else is there to llve for?
What else matters after having felt
the joy of your presence?
- When I...
- Hm?
When I think of my llfe and on what
poor stuff my dreams were fed!
I feel such futllity in growing old.
If you were to leave me, I'd...
No. No, it is I
who shall never leave you.
Oh, Maximllian.
What evll spirit forces you
to utter such words?
- Have you no pride?
- No.
I have no pride
when it comes to words,
what things I do.
I only have the greatest regrets
for what I have not done.
Mother, please.
Try to understand.
If you knew how desperate I feel...
We both know
how it wlll end, Maximllian.
No, you're wrong.
You're wrong this time, Mother.
(Contessa) No, my son.
(Max) It wlll be different.
You can't stop me, Mother.
(Contessa) Oh, my poor chlld!
(Max) I'm no longer a chlld.
Let me llve my llfe.
(Contessa)
Come, Maximllian, come...
No, don't shout.
Be quiet! Don't make a sound!
Shh! Quiet!
Quiet, my love!
You must belleve me.
I want to help you.
For years I've waited
for this moment, trust me.
We must flee from here.
Wait for me here.
I'll go and see what he's doing.
Wait for me, my love.

Newly moulded this morning
and already it's spllt!
Must be that synthetic glue.
Mm, that's what it is.
(Hums)
Hm.
Neither glue nor spllntered heads
can stop the funeral.
The ceremony must go on.
The Countess is waiting.
Waiting... to bury the dead.
(Chuckles)
The poor Countess isn't so wrong, really.
Wanting to get rid of him.
He's not...
a very pleasant memory.
A man...

(Laughs) That's pretty good.
A man losing his head.
Hm.
A husband.
A husband losing his head...
over a woman?
(Tuts)
Shame on you. But stlll,
the Countess wants his body repaired.
She wants it put in working order
for the burial.
Tradition, she says.
More work, I say!
All this tradition.
I wouldn't mind if I had any.
But what does tradition mean
to a poor devll llke me?
Work and fatigue,
that's my inheritance.
They break, they snap,
they pop, they crackle,
and I'm the one who puts their tradition
back together again.
(Gargles)
Hm!
And now I've got
another puppet to make.
Lucky for me,
you look just llke her.
Because... you won't be around tomorrow,
that's for sure.
I knew you'd be back.
Everything's been ready.
We were only waiting.
But you didn't come back here for me,
your wife.
You came back for her.
You saw her.
She was in that body.
And you came back for her.
(Leandro) Gently.
Ever so gently.
Ah!

Oh, blast!

Hm.
Hmm.

But... but it... isn't possible.
Oh, be careful. please don't touch.
The glue is stlll wet.
- Size... six and a half.
- But he can't be! He spoke to me!
Hm? Well, that's no reason
to faint dead away.
It's quite possible that he spoke to you.
I mean, this is Señor Carlos.
That's the Countess's husband.
Maximllian's step-father.
I mean, why shouldn't you have seen him?
He was here. (Chuckles)
No, don't you see? It can't be.
I... I know he's dead.
I saw him in his casket in the chapel!
In the chapel?
No, no, no, no.
You saw this dummy in the coffin.
You see, it's a dress rehearsal
for the funeral ceremony.
Oh, by the way, I dropped it
and it broke on the way here,
but please don't tell the Countess.
I mean, I fixed it.
You can hardly tell, can you?
Hm?
Then Carlos is... is allve.
Isn't he?
Oh, no.
Señor Carlos... is dead.
Hm.

Oh, yes. Oh, yes, my lady.
She is Miss Elena in person.

Maximllian!
Your mother is after me.
We'll go away... the two of us.
I'll help you escape.

My mother is jealous beyond reason.
I don't want to spend the rest of my llfe

Are you searching, Leandro?
Answer me.
We must find her

(Contessa) Leandro!
You're so beautiful.
I didn't think there could ever be a girl
as beautiful as you.
You're even more beautiful than Elena.
Elena?
Come.
- Come.
- Where are we...?
No, I don't want
to think about her now.
She brings back
so many sad memories.
I loved her deeply,
yet she deceived me.
- Come, I'll show her to you.

It's true, she wouldn't.
She wouldn't.

What wlll that change?
It's all my fault.
- I should have stopped you.
- No!
- I should never have let you meet her.
- Quiet.
After what you did to Elena.
After what I did to Elena?
- Maximllian, please.
- And what about what she did to me?
- She ran away with your husband.
- Maximllian, I forbid you to talk that...
Your husband!
Yet Carlos never knew
why she didn't join him.
I avenged myself and you
at the same time.
No, it's not as simple as you think,
Maximllian.
Now they'll come looking
for all those people.
Why did you do it, my chlld?
Why?
- They were going to take my Lisa away.
- That would've been better for all of us.
That stupid driver.
I had to stop them!
That girl wlll be the end of us.
You must get rid of her.
No. No!
If we cover every trace of what happened
here, there'll stlll be a chance.
Otherwise they'll take you away,
and you wlll be punished, my love.
I can't go on llke this!
I can't llve llke this
in your shrine of death!
- It's all around me!
- Maximllian.
I want to llve.
I want to be free.
I want to be with people!
- I understand, poor chlld.
- Don't call me that!
I'm your mother.
No-one can understand you as I do,
or protect you as I do.
Listen to me.
You wlll be saved
only if Lisa disappears.
- Lisa.
- Listen to me, my chlld.
Lisa.
Go.
- Get out.
- Don't talk that way to your mother.
You are very cruel with me today,
but I forgive you.
I know you don't mean what you say.
Do you, my darllng?
Say that you love me.

(Max) Lisa!
Lisa!
You shall never leave me.
We'll always be together.
Don't go...
Don't go!
(Chlldren chanting) One... two...
Hey, come back!
She's a ghost.
Everyone knows that.
No one's llved there
for a hundred years.
- She's a ghost.
- A ghost!
- Let's run!
- Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Hm...
Here you are, Mr Leandro.
It's the best I could do.
I had such a short notice.
I do hope
you think it's all right, sir.
Oh?
I'm afraid it's all too late, my friend.
All too late.
The airport, right away, please.

(Sobs)
Help! Open up!
Someone, please!

(Sobs)
- please, Captain.
