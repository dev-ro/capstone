Lee Yongnam, is not accepted
as a new employer.
I can't see anything.
In front of me.
Open you eyes.
I don't know what to do,
and where to go anymore.
When I was a kid,
I had a dream.
Now, I'm not sure anymore.
Your dream that you had...
is in the past and now...
we are only trash.
The other is ready to work

There is something bothering me.
The kids don't want to eat
without their grandmother's kimchi.
What time is it now?

Mom cannot say anything
even though she has a lot in her mind.
Unbelievable.
It is her 70th birthday,
many people will come to the party.
She wants to brag about her son.
I have nothing to say.
Even there is nothing to brag about
at least you should look nice, shouldn't you?
Stop it, please.
I can't live because of you.
What is this?
You want to open a thrift shop here?
You haven't thrown this things away?
Put it back to its place,
while I'm asking nicely.
What will you do with all this things?
Ah, I'm shouting again.

Her strength is no joke.
Asshole.
She is very strong.
It must be hard for my brother-in-law
to live with her.
My poor brother-in-law.
Is he got beaten every time?
<b>5 years ago-</b>
First, before climbing
what we should do is...
route finding.
What is route finding?
It's looking for a way.
You can set your goal,
but if you don't know the route and the method,
you won't be able to proceed.
Analyze route that you choose from the very beginning to the end,
think about the difficulty and safety in your head.
Calculate all possible way to reach the end in or head,
that is what we called route finding.
You can do it!
Keep climbing.
-Good job, good job.
-Yeah, like that.
Almost done, keep up!
Hey stupid!
Mind your step!
You really...
You are almost there!
You did it!

Will you like it
if I touch your hair carelessly?
This kid.
Are you crazy?
I just want to make you look handsome.
Are we not go?
You has been saying "just one minute"
for one hour.
Just don't go. Let's not go.

We should have arrived first
to greet the guests.
Stop grumbling,

Let me fix your tie.
The kids will take care everything.
Just do what you are told to do.
Will you drink a lot today?
I won't drink.

Okay.
Mom.
Don't run.
Why they haven't arrive?
That's them!
-Grandfather.

It has been years since you live like that.
Lately you like to have a fight, eat and sleep.
Bro, She is really pathetic.
Shut your mouth and eat.

I am addicted to kimbab.
I study really hard.
I need something to eat.
Yeah, eat a lot.
What are you doing lately?
Yongnam said he only eat and sleep all day.
I'm so jealous.
Is he a poor man?.
There is no one who live like that.
You call that human?
Bro, don't worry.
It's just temporary ,
everything will be okay.
Is that a new trend?
People easily said "everything will be okay".
Hey, people hate you, right?
But you don't know.
No, I know it.
There is someone who even wants to kill me.
Look at the camera.
1... 2... 3...

How do I know what kind of smoke is that?
Now everywhere is filled
with that white smoke.
Here? The address...
What is the address?
Here, what is the address? Hurry.
The address is...
...street
AmGil Street, 32-1 Lion Building, 'Cloud Garden' Building.
Please hurry.
Remove her clothes
rub his skin with water.
Water...
Hey, take some water.
This, wet towel.
Pour the water slowly.
Mom will be okay.
What is that actually?
The smoke is rising.
Everyone, to the roof.
The gas is spreading
from the crossroad of Central Station.
My goodness.
What kind of crazy person
who leak this gas?
Hold on.
Hurry, hold her.
What are you going to do?
Yongnam, do something.
She can't breathe.
Yongnam.
Mom.
Brother-in-law, move her.
1... 2... 3...
Dad, mom, what are you waiting for?
Tell everyone to go to the roof.
Jiho, you go with me.
Listen...
Let's go to the roof.
Don't you hear me?
It's dangerous here.
Please listen to me.
Warning!, Poisonous Gas is spreading
in Central Station of new International Future City,
go to the roof and wait for evacuation team.
-Roof.
-We need go to the roof.
Multipurpose Hall
'Cloud Garden'
Open the door.
What's wrong?
Why the door won't open?
-What's wrong?
-Please move.
This is an automatic door.
You need key...
Why the door can't be opened?
No way.
Mom, are you okay?
Hey, kid.
The key is in the security room,
first floor.
Go there, and get the key.
Hurry up!
Me?
The gas is rising,
how can he go there?
Is the door really can't be opened?
What about the spare key,
you have it, right?
-No.
-What?
I don't bring the key.
There's no key?
What are you doing?
Why are you still here?
The door is locked
he said he didn't have the key.
What?
Hurry up...
From Central Station to
AnGil Station is about 500m.
The Gas is spreading.
It will be difficult to do the evacuation
in location.
There's no other way than using helicopter.
Have they figure out what kind of gas is that?
They have sent professional,
but still no answer.
Here's the condition from above.
We should figure out what is that first,
so we can take action.
What kind of disaster is this.
Let me do it.
Do something!
You are liable for this, aren't you?
Why me? It's my dad, not me.
How can we open the door?
The key is not with me.
Someone should open it from outside.
Don't just stay here, let's look for the key.
Just say that the key is missing.
Let's go down and find the key!
-Jung-Hyun.
-Still can't be opened.
We can't do anything without the key.
The white poisonous gas,
can cause skin burn, blindness also respiratory failure.
Inhaling too much gas can be fatal.
We still cannot figure out what kind of gas is that.
According to the professionals…
We inform you,
You can avoid the gas by using mask,
available in public building
For those who are in contaminated area,
Use mask filter which is in the purple bag.
Cover yourself with plastic
to avoid contamination.
The mask filter can be use...
for 15 minutes if breathe slowly.
If you breathe fast, it can last for 10 minutes.
After that, you won't be able to avoid the gas,
unless you replace the filter.
How can it only last for 10 minutes?
Who can last that short in this situation?
Is there no masks here?
Please wait.
Manager?
Do you see the masks in the drawer?
No, i don't see it.
I'm sure we have 3 here.
Hold on.
The evacuation by helicopter has started.
Someone sent me a picture.
Bro.
What about this?
Tom Cruise can open the safe
with this...
Hold on.
Evacuation will be hard for people in short building.
Firefighting helicopters are equipped with
a gondola...
that can carry 20 people in one go.
However...
aren't we only have 10 helicopters?
-It based on priority.
-See.
I told you!
The Helicopters are limited.
Thank you for the interview.
So, who send SOS first, will get be evacuated first...
Also the one that can be seen by them
will get rescued first, right?
What should we do now?
Hey, hey, hey...
Where is Yongnam?
If we have the mask, we can go to first floor
and find the key.
Who can guarantee if the key is there?
Yongnam?
-What are you doing there?
-Ui-Joo.
The door can be opened from outside, right?
What?
I mean...
You sure it can be opened from outside, right?
Yeah, I'm sure.
GAS MASK
It's here!
The masks are in here.
This are the masks.
I found the masks.
You can run, right?
I'm sure I saw the key
in the first floor.
I'll let you know the location.
No...no...
What's in your hand?
<b>TROPHY AWARD</b>
It's nothing.
Wait.
Get ready..
Shit.

This is the detail of the terror attack.
Last night, 11:00 PM, in Central Station,
new International Future City.
The truck used by the perpetrator caught in CCTV nearby.
At 11:10, the truck stopped at
'ANSWER Chemical' new building.
From that truck, the poisonous gas was released.

'Yang' is one of the co-founder at 'ANSWER Chemical'
He was also the chief of R&D.
The Police have found the materials and ingredients
for creating that gas
in a place where was used by 'Yang'.
Investigation shows, after being fired...
'Yang' lost all of his patents, and sued the company for that.
However, he lost in trial.
Insider said, 'Yang' threatened the executives of the company.

even with the smallest chemical reaction
a large amount of gas can be produced.
It will also last for quite a long time.
The way to neutralize the gas hasn't been found yet.
