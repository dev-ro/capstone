- Hi, Tony! Two or three?
- Two. Give me two. That's good.
Do you do lay-away?
lf it doesn't turn into
a 20-year mortgage.
Here's five dollars for the blue shirt
in the window. Hold it for me.
- Wait for your receipt!
- l trust you.
Please don't trust me.
- What did he charge you?
- 7.98.
Wait until he runs out.
You know what to tell her?
- Got a second?
- Just a minute.
- Look what l've got. Carnival Gold.
- l've waited half an hour for this paint.
l'll make you a deal.
l'll make you a nice deal on this.
A dollar off.
1 0.98 on this special gold paint.
- How do you like that?
- Thank you.
- l'll take a gallon of this.
- You got it. Let's go!
That's all right. Customers like that.
lt gives them a sense of power.
- l need some brushes.
- How much painting do you plan to do?
After this l wouldn't paint
my wife's ass purple.
- What colour is it now?
- You ask me about my wife's ass?!
- You brought it up.
- lt has no colour, just stretch stripes.
- What about the brushes?
- The second display counter there.
- Mr Fusco, can l have an advance?
- Payday is Monday.
l know, but every place else
pays on Friday or Saturday.
And they're broke on Monday. Booze,
whores, pissing away their money.
This way you've got money all week.
You can save for the future.
- Fuck the future!
- No, Tony, you can't fuck the future.
The future catches up with you, and it
fucks you if you haven't planned for it.
Tonight is the future, and l'm planning
for it. There's a shirt l have to buy...
Sorry, Tony. No exceptions.
Just wait until you need
an advance, bigshot!
Thanks, Tony!
Where have you been?
Your mother wants to know
where you've been.
- Where have you been?
- Your father asked where you've been.
Dinner will be late. Things had sold out
at the market. Normally you'd be late!
- Hey, Tony!
- Hot stuff, give me a kiss.
- Look what l made for you.
- That is beautiful.
- Like it? Will you put it in your room?
- Yeah, l'll put it in my room right now.
- Dinner's on the table.
- l'm not hungry.
Just because you're kicking in for food,
doesn't mean you don't eat.
- l've got my shirt on.
- So?
- l don't want to get anything on it.
- You don't have to worry.
Your mother's spaghetti sauce
doesn't drip or taste.
Let's go!
lt's always the same.
You say l'm late for dinner, but l work
until six and can't make dinner in time.
You should've been a priest, like your
brother. You wouldn't worry about a job.
Yeah.
- Must you always cross yourself?
- He's a priest. Father Frank Junior.
She doesn't have much to cross herself
about these days.
- You're so jealous of Frank Junior.
- Shut up!
- Hey, watch the shirt, stupid!
- Basta! Mangia, mangia!
- Eat. l've got more pork chops.
- More pork chops? l'm out of work!
As long as we have a dollar,
we eat good. l might get a job.
Like hell! 25 years in construction
work. l've always had a paycheque.
For 6, 7 months l'm out of work,
and all of a sudden you hit me.
- And talk back. Talk of getting a job.
- OK, no hitting at the dinner table.
- You were the one who was hitting.
- You never hit me before. Never.
Not in front of the kids.
- One pork chop!
- Hey, Frank!
lt's disgusting.
Would you just watch the hair?
l work on my hair a long time,
and you hit it. He hits my hair.
Take care of his hair.
l'm going to take a walk.
- Will you walk me to church?
- Haven't you been today?
- Confession. l must go back and pray.
- For what?
- For Father Frank Junior to call me.
- Why not call him?
- A son should call his mother.
- You'll ask God to make Frank call you?
- Right.
- l don't believe it.
You're turning God
into a telephone operator.
You scumbags! Get back here.
- Assholes.
- Come on, fuckhead!
The stubborn fuck won't budge!
- Put your hands on the wheel.
- l have!
- You almost broke my pussy finger.
- You wouldn't know which one it was.
Have some. Tell them what we have.
We have ups, downs, three ludes,
two jays and half a bottle of vodka.
You get a bigger high from a fart!
- You want something?
- We're not dropping until l say so.
- Why not?
- l've got my reasons.
- What's wrong with you?
- Give me the vodka.
Get some new tapes. These are old.
l got them in the bargain basement.
lf you don't like them, l'll get new ones.
Looking sharp, huh?
- Any sharper and you'd be a nigger.
- Or a spic.
Would you put your dick in a spic?
Does it get bigger in a nigger?
- l don't know.
- l've got to score tonight. l'm horny!
Yeah, l know what you mean.
Anybody who scores
gets ten minutes in the car.
- Make five and you get the Pope's ass!
- The Pope doesn't have an ass.
Shape up. We're the Faces.
Tony, how's it going?
Hey, Mark!
Tony, have you seen Pauline here?
- No, we haven't seen Pauline.
- Have you seen Pauline?
- What would you like?
- Give me a ''7 7''.
- A beer.
- A vodka and tonic.
Are you seeing the Knicks on Tuesday?
Tony.
- Yeah?
- What do you mean ''yeah''?
l mean, l can dance with you, but
you're not my dream girl or anything.
You want a dream girl?
Then go to sleep and have a nightmare.
- Gus, here's the speed.
- What are you doing? Take this.
Hello! This is Monty, your delicious DJ,
reminding you about the disco
sweepstakes. Get in line to get the prize!
What a trip! A good trip!
Feel the music, baby.
l want to dance with that chick.
- Which one?
- Just there.
Come on, Tony, dance!
lt's so beautiful, man. l like your new
haircut. l like that polyester look.
Tony, you're the king out there.
You're a great dancer.
- You'd be as good if you practised.
- Could l be a good dancer?
- Sure, why not? No.
- No?
- Won't you ask me to sit down?
- No, you'd do it.
- But you'd ask me to lay down.
- No, you would not do it.
Double J, move over.
Meet my friend, here.
Tony, do you want some speed?
lt's really good stuff.
- Can't you guys get off on dancing?
- Tony, can l wipe off your forehead?
Why not? Go ahead.
lt's no blow job.
You don't know fuck about women. You
get a blow job easier than you get that.
l love to watch you dance, Tony.
l love it. l love to watch you dance!
l just love it. Watching you dance.
Why don't you take her for a dance?
That's a good idea.
Would you like to dance?
Any dressing with the lace on the side.
Weirdest chick l've ever seen.
l love to. l love to watch you dance!
l just love it. Watching you dance.
Doreen, move up a little bit.
You look like you're doing two-step.
Get your head out of his belt!
Oh, Jesus!
You can't dance to this shit!
- Monty, why are you playing that shit?
- What?
Look at that chick.
She's dancing, she's moving.
Joe, you know that girl?
- No.
- Seen her before?
No.
Yeah, l saw her here
about a month ago.
She can dance.
She's got the wrong partner,
but she can dance.
Ask her.
- Fuck you.
- Which position?
Who's that guy?
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, Tony!
- How are you?
- OK, and you?
- Will you dance for me?
- Sure, why not?
- Hello, Lucille.
- Nureyev, how are you?
- Do you have a ''7 7''?
- Sure, doll.
Give me one of your butts, too.
- They're having another sweepstakes.
- l know that.
lt's double the prize money, $500.
Are you going to enter?
You'll need a partner.
- We won before.
- We're going to have to practise.
- We'll have to practise.
- People are coming from Manhattan.
- Revelation Gazebo, you know?
- We'll have to practise.
Let's practise, Annette. l don't mean
dating or socialising. l mean practise.
- Why not? We had a date.
- Yeah, once. And once was enough.
- Why?
- Why?
You only talked about your married
sister. And your other married sister.
And your third married sister. l felt that
you just wanted to be a married sister.
Look, l told you l'd take care of it.
Double J has been in the car
25 minutes with some chick.
l can't get the selfish prick out.
These guys can't do nothing
without me.
- You gonna make it with Annette?
- l don't think so.
lf you make it with some chicks,
they think you'll dance with them.
Get out! You've been in there
20 minutes.
- 25 in the car, 20 in the chick.
- Get out before we pull you out.
- She hasn't come.
- Since when did you care?
Come on!
OK, it's happening.
lt's happening, it's happening!
l'll be out in a minute.
Harder! l'm coming, l'm coming!
What was your name?
Kiss me.
Kiss me!
l just kissed Al Pacino!
l don't look like Al Pacino.
l could look like him. Al Pacino.
Yeah. Al Pacino.
Al Pacino!
Attica, Attica!
- Attica, Attica, Attica!
- Give me the ball!
- Wanna see the Bruce Lee picture?
- He's dead, so l don't give a damn.
Have you no respect for the guy?
- See what the Knicks pay Frazier?
- We'll never make that much money.
- Hey, douche, douche!
- lt's all right.
- Why don't you kill fags on Sunday?
- 'Cause then they'll go to heaven.
Hey, sweetheart! You're terrific!
Hey, double dirty!
- This is a drag.
- What's with you today?
- l'm not sure l'll do 2001 tonight.
- Fucking do it!
Do you have 20-30 bucks
to blow twice a week?
Come on, Tony!
- l'm going to get one of these.
- You'll never have that kind of money.
- That's your favourite speech!
- We'll never have that much money.
Get it together before it's all over.
A Caddy Seville.
My uncle has one, plus a Mercedes.
He got them by forcing
his partner to sell out.
- lt's a dog-eat-dog world.
- lt's true.
They have it all locked up.
Nobody will give you a chance.
- Nobody gives you nothing.
- lt's every man for himself.
lt's a stinking rat race.
- Best vinyl l've ever seen at that price!
- l told you. You just listen to me.
You saved me a bit of change. lf you
ever want to be a painter, let me know.
You make twice as much as here.
Are you interested?
l don't know.
You make twice as much,
but break your back!
- No advances, nothing...
- l gave you a raise.
- What?
- A raise.
- Are you kidding?
- Come on, see how much it is.
- Thank you. l can't believe this.
- You better look.
- lt doesn't matter. You gave me a raise.
- lt's only 2.50.
- So what?
- $2.50 ain't much.
- The important thing is that it's a raise.
- l'll give you 3.50 next week. A dollar...
Shut up, will you? Four.
l'll make it an even four.
Never seen anybody so happy
over a crummy 2.50 raise!
Two? You just said $4, didn't you?
- What the hell are you doing?
- l feel like it.
- Girls do that.
- l got a raise today.
Why didn't you say that during dinner?
Put them down. How much did you get?
lt will be $4.00.
lt was 2.50, but he raised the raise
when he saw l wasn't disappointed.
$4.00?
Shit! Do you know what $4.00 buys
today? Not even $3.00!
- Has Unemployment given you a raise?
- $4.00? Shit!
l knew you'd piss on it. Go on, piss
on it! A raise means that you're good.
How many times has somebody
told me l was good? Two times.
This raise and dancing at the disco.
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole!
$4.00. Shit!
- Why aren't you waiting inside?
- l wanted to watch you walk.
Shit.
Tony, listen...l've been thinking.
- Maybe l'll make it with you.
- You call that thinking? Jesus Christ!
You're too much, Annette.
lf you say we're going to make it,
then we'll make it? So l have no say?
lt's time we went out. You wanted to.
You told me how horny a man gets
at 1 9. His balls ache if he doesn't get it.
How do you remember those things?
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together practising.
lf we were balling, we'd be going
together. l don't want to go with you.
- Are you a nice girl or a cunt?
- l don't know. Both?
You can't be both. A girl has to decide
early on what she's going to be.
- Hi, Pete.
- Tony, my man!
- Do you have a free studio?
- Two.
- How are you doing?
- Steady at 65%.
Pete! He's always busting my onions.
- l send customers and get free studio...
- What's 65% ?
That means that he...
He scores with 65% of the chicks
that come in here.
One-two-three, two-two-three.
One-two, one-two-three, one-two-three.
Good!
Good. That's it. Do it again.
- That's it. Good. Again.
- Tony, it's only dancing!
lf you're not going to take this seriously,
l don't want to dance.
- Don't get mad.
- Don't get mad?
l think we've done enough dancing
for today.
- So let's dance on Wednesday?
- Yeah, sure.
- Are you going home now?
- No, l'm going to talk to Peter.
And work on some stuff myself.
See you later. You were good today.
Hi. How are you doing?
You're a very good dancer,
you know that?
l would like to meet you.
- Would you mind just going away?
- What?
Don't be hurt. l want to be by myself,
you know?
- l saw you at 2001 .
- So?
You looked at me and l looked at you.
l look at a guy for a millionth of a second
and he gets delusions of grandeur!
- l'm going to tell you what you are.
- l bet it begins with a ''C'', Mr P.
Fine, fine. That's...
l know the type. Fine.
Why are you up so late? What is this?
Don't you have any criticism of me?
- Your brother's upstairs.
- You're kidding!
- Frankie! How are you doing?
- How are you, kid?
- lt's good to see you.
- You, too.
- You look good.
- No, l don't. You look wonderful.
- Checking out my trophy?
- That's you? First prize.
- Looks just like you.
- What did you say to them?
They look like zombies,
like somebody died!
- l think they're in shock, Tony.
- Why would they be in shock?
- l'm leaving the Church.
- Yeah, sure. Leaving the Church.
- Tell me another one.
- l'm leaving the priesthood.
Frank, don't fool around like that.
Do you think l'm losing my hair?
lt looks very thin right here and here.
Are you serious?
Can l borrow your clothes until l buy
some? l don't want to wear the uniform.
- l'm really sorry, Frank.
- What are you sorry about?
- You got fired, right?
- No, l quit.
- You quit?
- Yeah, you can, you know?
Well, what did Mom say about it?
''Dear Lord, what am l going to tell
Theresa and Marie?''
- What did Dad say?
- They're ashamed. Both of them.
Are you ashamed of me, Tony?
Yeah.
- Didn't they ask why?
- No.
l think they're afraid to.
Like l might say, ''Celibacy''.
But...
Are you going to sleep here tonight?
ln my room?
- Yeah, l thought l would.
- All right, l'll get blankets for you.
Frank, how come you left, really?
lt's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.
One day you look at a crucifix, and
all you see is a man dying on a cross.
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.
They turn you into what they wish
at the time.
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.
All l ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest, so...
l guess we'll have to take your picture
down from the mantle.
You know what's weird? l always felt
l was the shit and you were perfect.
Now that l'm the disgrace to the family,
l'm not so perfect any more.
So maybe you're not shit any more.
Yeah, maybe if you're not so good,
then l'm not so bad.
Yeah.
- Give me the groceries.
- Don't take my groceries. Come on!
- Don't eat the apple. Give it back.
- Here.
Jesus! What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?
My brother quit the Church.
l feel wild. l've got all this energy!
l'll call you tonight, all right?
See you later, Gus!
Higher with the arms! Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, do it to me!
- She come in?
- l told you she comes in on Tuesday.
- So is she here?
- What is today?
- lt's Tuesday.
- Yeah.
Hey, Tone! Watch it. That one's
practising to be a bitch. Come on!
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.
l'm Tony Manero.
We both have the same last initial.
When we get married l don't have to
change the monogram on my luggage.
Somebody said you're practising
to be a bitch. ls that true?
- What do you want to ask me?
- Will you have coffee with me?
- ls that it?
- l think you're a very good dancer.
You know that 2001 Odyssey
has a dance contest now?
l think that we could be
a dynamite team together.
- How old are you?
- l'm 20.
l'm 1 9 at the moment,
but l'll be 20 very shortly.
l think there's a world of difference
between us.
Not just chronologically, but emotionally,
culturally, physically, every way,
and this world would get bigger
and worse with every passing week.
- What shit is that? Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee?
l work with very remarkable people.
They're not like Bay Ridge people.
- Snobs instead of slobs?
- What?
Nothing. Bay Ridge isn't the worst part
of Brooklyn.
- lt's no hellhole.
- Well, it ain't...isn't Manhattan.
Right over there, across the river,
everything is completely different.
lt's beautiful! People are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.
The secretaries all shop
at Bonwit Teller.
The lunch hours are beautiful, too.
They'll give you two hours for lunch
to do something related.
We saw Zeffirelli's ''Romeo and Juliet''.
''Romeo and Juliet''?
l read that in high school.
That's Shakespeare, right?
No, it's Zeffirelli, the director
of the movie. You know, the movie?
What l never understood
about ''Romeo and Juliet''
is why Romeo took
the poison so quick.
l feel like he could have waited.
lt's the way they took poison
in those days.
- Are you eating? Here's the menu.
- No, l'll just have tea with lemon.
l've started drinking tea.
lt's more refined.
Oh, yeah?
All the women executives drink tea
with lemon. They notice that l do, too.
- l like coffee. l drink coffee.
- Yeah.
l've only been with this agency
a short time,
but over there l'm functioning
in a kind of public relations capacity.
l fill in for the agents.
This week l had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at the Côte Basque.
- And Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Far out!
You heard of those restaurants?
No, l don't know those exact
restaurants, but l know the type.
- But you must have heard of the artists.
- No, l don't know... Not really.
- Why did you say, ''Far out''?
- lt sounded like far out. Wasn't it?
- Yeah.
- We'd like a lemon with some tea.
l'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.
Know who came in the office?
Laurence Olivier.
- Who's that?
- You don't know who he is?
Laurence Olivier is the greatest actor
in the world! You know who he is.
He's the English actor on television,
who does those Polaroid commercials.
Oh, him! He's good. He is good.
l did a few errands for him.
He tells everyone in the office
that l'm the brightest, the most
vivacious thing in the entire office!
Could you get a camera from him
at a discount?
- l didn't ask him about a camera!
- 'Cause you have one, you sly fox.
- Are you enjoying what l'm telling you?
- Sure.
Maybe you can't handle hearing about
a kind of life so different from yours.
- You mean better?
- Yes, sure, it's better.
Ketchup, please.
l'm out of this Bay Ridge scene.
l'm getting my own apartment
in Manhattan.
l'm changing as a person. l'm growing.
Nobody knows how much l'm growing.
Why don't you go on a diet?
Listen. l like you.
We could dance together, nothing more.
l don't want you coming on to me.
- Why not?
- l don't dig guys like you any more.
You're too young, have no class,
and you don't have your shit together.
lt's easy to get your shit together.
Take a salad bowl and potato masher.
Get your shit together.
Shall l tell you what l do?
- lt's not necessary.
- l'll tell you.
l work in a paint store, and l got a raise.
Right, and you probably
live with your family,
hang out with your buddies, and
Saturday nights you blow it all at 2001 .
You're a cliché. You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.
- Do you have a stairway to the stars?
- Maybe.
l'm taking a course,
and next semester l'll take two.
- You didn't go to college, did you?
- No.
- Did you ever think of going to college?
- No, did you?
- Not back then...
- Then why bug me about it?
Why didn't you want to go to college?
Tell me.
Jesus Christ! l didn't!
The high l get at 2001 is just dancing.
lt's not being a bastard or anything.
But l'd like to get that high
someplace else in my life, you know?
- Like where?
- l don't know where. Someplace.
Dancing can't last forever.
lt's a short-lived kind of thing.
But l'm getting older, you know?
But so what? Does that mean l can't
feel that way about anything else in life?
- ls that it?
- We have to split here.
- No, l'll walk you the rest of the way.
- No, l'll meet you at the dance studio.
- Stephanie, l can walk you home.
- Nothing personal, right?
Come on, Stephanie! l can walk you.
Jesus Christ! You know...
- Where is he? Did you call him?
- No.
- What's the matter?
- Gus is in hospital. The spics got him.
- Barons?
- Barracudas.
- That's my fucking car!
- Give me the keys.
- You're asking for it.
- l just saw him!
- He could have run, but that's Gus.
- Don't worry about it.
l visited him. He has a broken nose,
ribs, leg and four teeth knocked out.
He was carrying his groceries
and three of them jumped him.
They spilled his groceries.
So he said, under his breath, ''Grease-
balls, spic-dicks,'' and they got him.
Check it out.
Nobody in there.
We're going to cruise around until
there's enough of them we can handle.
- We'll pick off a couple on the street.
- That's pussy!
- You're fucked up!
- l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
Forget it, we'll get them tomorrow.
Dream good, jerk off better.
- Tony, l'm getting married.
- Will you cut that shit.
l just wanted to let you know.
lf you get married, we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?
- Take it easy.
- Bobby, get in the car!
We should go to the hospital tomorrow,
you know?
You cool off. You know?
All right. Goodnight.
- What did you say to Father Frank?
- What?
- What did you say?
- Yeah?
- What do you mean?
- You must have said something.
You sleep in the same room,
and then he stays out all night.
- l've said nothing.
- A priest staying out all night.
He's not a priest now,
so he can do what he wants.
- You said something!
- Are you trying to blame me?
- You've been writing to him.
- You're trying to hang this on me!
He called, he called.
ln time, he'll see he's wrong.
He's going through a trial of the soul.
He's going back to the Church.
- No, he won't...
- Yes, he's going back to the Church!
- He's going back!
- No! You don't have a priest any more.
You've got nothing but three
shit children now! Good, good.
l'm sorry, Mom.
l didn't mean that. l'm sorry.
- l love you, Mom. l really do.
- Go away. Get out of here.
- How are you?
- OK.
Look, Annette,
l have to tell you something.
lt's very hard to tell you this, but...
...l changed my mind about us dancing
together. l have another partner.
lt's professional. Things like this happen
when it's professional.
Jesus Christ. First my mother, now you.
Why do you hate me so much?
All l ever did was like you.
Give me a break.
- Hi.
- You're late.
Only five minutes.
How long have you been here?
- Six, seven minutes.
- Pete said you'd been here 1 5.
Who's he?
l've got some records. l don't know
if you like them. You like these guys?
Yeah, super.
You do the New York Hustle
or the Latin Hustle?
New York, Latin, l do it all.
Follow me this time.
- That's nice. Did you make that up?
- l saw it on TV first, then l made it up.
- l learned one. What l do...
- Wait, let me check something out.
- Come on.
- What are you doing?
Stay right there.
- Now we can dance!
- Let me show you the Latin step.
Take your hand like this and count.
One-two-three, two-two-three.
Three-two-three, kick-two-three.
l've got it. lt's good.
l like that.
- Do you know the Tango Hustle?
- Yeah.
Let's try that.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, l gotta go home.
l like you when you're like this.
When you're quiet
and not laying all that shit on me.
Guess who l had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.
- l had to open my big mouth.
- lt was interesting. Very interesting.
- A very intelligent fellow.
- You cream over that word interesting.
- What's wrong with interesting?
- Something. Let me tell you something.
- l think you're full of shit.
- Oh, you do?
But l don't know how much is shit
and how much is bullshit.
When you figure it out,
let me know, all right?
We should practise a couple of more
times. Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.
- Would Saturday be good?
- Maybe.
Stephanie, l want to ask you something.
l don't know how to say this.
Do you think that l am
either interesting or intelligent?
lnteresting, yeah.
lntelligent?
l don't know. Maybe.
l've got to know you better. You've got
a way of seeing things a certain way.
lnteresting, yeah.
lntelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.
Well, what do you know? All right!
Stephanie, why don't we talk about
how we feel when we're dancing?
- Goodnight and thanks.
- Could l walk you the rest of the way?
No.
You shouldn't have asked,
you should have just done it!
Hot stuff. Jesus!
- What's happening?
- This is my brother Frank.
Our table is over there.
You guys have a Moses effect!
The crowd parts like the Red Sea.
- They know the Faces.
- Do you like it, Father?
Do l look like your father? Please don't
call me that. l never could stand that.
But, yeah, l think the place
is energising!
Hey, Tony.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Are you as good in bed
as on the dance floor?
Are you? Are you as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor?
He never made it in a bed.
Watch this. This isn't
my regular partner, but you'll see.
- What are you going to have to drink?
- ''7 7''.
Where is she?
So, when is Connie going to get
her answer?
- You know, Connie?
- Yeah?
lf you're as good in bed as you are on
the dance floor, you're one lousy fuck.
Why do they always send flowers
the next day?
Some guys don't know a lousy fuck.
Or maybe they thought you were dead!
Father, listen.
My girlfriend is such a good Catholic,
she says she loves Communion wafers.
- Mr Manero, can l talk to you?
- What's he doing?
Forget this!
Give the kid some room.
He's taking over again!
- He's very good.
- He's the king out there, Father.
- He's the best.
- He's great, he's great.
- Can l talk to you, Father?
- Call me Frank.
Frank, listen. Do you want
to hear something? My girlfriend...
Can l tell you something?
Come here for a second.
l have a lot of ideas. l was reading
about the Pope. Father!
- Frank.
- Frank. Yeah, Frank.
Listen, Frank. l have a girlfriend.
Her name is Pauline, and l...
- What? Did you get her pregnant?
- Yes, l did. Yes, l did.
She loves Communion wafers.
l have ideas swimming around in my
head. l've been reading a lot of stuff.
- l heard the Pope can give a special...
- ...dispensation.
Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?
- A dispensation for an abortion?
- Yeah, do you think he could?
- l don't think so, Bobby.
- Maybe he could for me.
- Maybe?
- Sorry, Bobby. l don't think so.
Have you talked to your priest about it?
Yeah, l've talked to everybody about it.
l mean, l've talked to a lot of people.
Thank you! Thanks a lot. You play,
you pay, you know? lt's funny, right?
Don't forget, everybody.
You could win, too, man!
Disco Universe Sweepstakes
are just a week away.
- Do you know Stephanie Mangano?
- No.
- l do.
- Has she come in?
- No, not yet.
- Are you sure?
- Tony! That was great.
- You liked it?
- l'm going home now.
- Home?
Stay longer. The night's just beginning.
lt's not my scene.
You didn't expect me to stay all night?
No, l didn't. Yes, l thought that
maybe you'd stay a little...
- No, it's not your scene.
- l'm sorry.
Don't worry about it. lt's nothing.
Come on, l'll walk you to the door.
You know, your dancing
is really marvellous. lt's exciting!
lt's exciting to watch you.
They can't keep their eyes off you.
- l have to go now.
- Have a good night. l'll see you later.
- Has she come in?
- You just asked me. She isn't here.
- ls your brother OK?
- He's fine. He just had a stomach thing.
Let's move.
We could make it now. We aren't
practising, so we could make it.
We make it when l decide, all right?
When l say so.
- l'll just make it with somebody else.
- Who?
- Somebody! Anybody here.
- Somebody here?
- Double J, Joey...
- The fuck you will!
Bobby, we're going to the car.
When l get back, we'll go to the bridge.
Are you fixed?
- Are you fixed?
- What do you mean?
- Are you on the Pill, or what?
- No.
No?
- What have you got? The lOU thing?
- No.
- No diaphragm? Nothing?
- lt doesn't matter.
- Nothing?
- Tony, l love you.
Are you kidding? Forget it.
Fuck! Just give me a blow job.
Come on.
- Just a minute.
- Hey, Tony!
Forget it. Fix yourself up. Everything
was cool, you had a good time.
Annette, cigarette?
Guess not.
Stupid screw-offs!
Annette, can you dig it?
l knew that you could.
- Joey!
- Fuck, Double J !
Tony! Let's get the motherfuck down!
Let's push him off!
- You're going in, you big fucking hunk!
- `sto cazzo, man!
Come on, Tony! Let's get him!
Come on, let's go.
- Honky!
- Let's get the motherfuck off!
Hey! Tarzan!
Double J !
Don't look! l'm coming!
You fuckers!
- Can you dig it?
- l knew that you could!
You stupid bitch.
l wish you were staying longer.
Ex-priests don't stay back home.
Everyone's too disgraced.
When a family raises a priest, they think
they've scored points in heaven.
We'd better get going. l have
to pick up some people on the way.
- We have to keep in touch.
- Will you like this settlement house?
lt'll do until l figure out my next move.
- And you?
- What?
- What will you do about the dancing?
- People ask me all the time.
All my life l've been told
l'm the no-good in the family.
The only way you'll survive is
to do what you think is right.
Not what they try to jam you into.
lf you do that, you'll end up miserable.
Have a good trip.
- l left you something in your room.
- What?
- A souvenir.
- Money?
Leave money!
- Hi! Why are you standing there?
- Why didn't you come on Saturday?
- l didn't say l would come.
- The fuck you did.
l said maybe.
l didn't think you'd get upset about it.
l'm not upset, but we needed
the practice. You should've been there.
Let's practise, then.
l didn't bring records.
l didn't think you'd be here.
So why did you come?
- `sto cazzo. Do you know `sto cazzo?
- Yeah, l know `sto cazzo.
We'll use this.
''lf you're not of your mind
to break up...''
- What's up?
- We've been waiting, man.
- Pete said you were practising.
- We've been cruising you-know-who.
We'll talk about it later.
Stephanie, this is Joey,
Double J and Bobby C.
- How are you? Are you a dancer?
- Yeah.
- Hungry?
- Yeah.
Where do you want to eat?
l'm going to change, and then...
- What maracas!
- They're nice tits.
l'm going on promotional tours
with authors and performers.
l'll hate leaving Manhattan and missing
certain ballets and concerts.
Tell them about the people
who come to the office.
You know who came in today?
David Bowie, in an astrakhan coat.
- He's a faggot.
- A half-faggot.
- Relax. Let's sit down.
- You mean he's bisexual?
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys. What's so funny?
Joe Namath came in today.
You know him?
He wanted some coffee, so l brought
him some, and he asked me to join him.
- Joe Namath?
- Yeah. We were talking a little.
He asked what it was like to be 21 .
l said l didn't know, because l'm just 20.
- What else?
- That's all.
- lsn't that enough?
- Don't you ever chew, Tony?
- When my mother dies, you get the job.
- Your throat is full of hamburger.
Big gobs, like dog food. Dog Friskies,
Yummies. He's going to turn into a dog!
Stephanie, can l talk to you?
You seem to know a lot of people
and a lot of places and things.
l have a friend. He's a very good friend,
and he got a girl pregnant.
lf you had to choose between abortion
and marriage, what would you do?
Who would l have to marry?
You'd have to marry me.
- l'd get an abortion. So long, Tony!
- lt was very nice meeting you.
- What did you think of her?
- l thought she was nice.
- She's a snotty bitch.
- She's cool when you get to know her.
- Did you fuck her yet?
- What do you think?
- l don't think so.
- You guys need to grow up.
You're babies.
l need the afternoon off.
Sam's out, Harold's sick. Take these.
- But l have to.
- Sorry, Tony.
l've been here almost eight months
and haven't missed a day!
- Not today, Tony.
- Come on, Mr Fusco!
When those old farts miss days,
you say nothing!
- Cool off!
- l'm taking the afternoon off.
- Then you're fired.
- l'm doing it.
- You're fired!
- Fuck you, asshole!
And the horse you rode in on.
- Cocksucker asshole!
- l don't want to marry Pauline.
- Then don't.
- l have to! She won't have an abortion.
- Everyone says l have to marry her.
- Who?
Her fucking parents, my fucking
parents, the fucking priest,
her fucking guidance counsellor.
Tony, l'm paralysed.
You and me have been friends
a long time. l'm hurting.
Shit! You're always together and l'm
always fucking up. You're always OK.
Everybody fucks up. Really!
Don't worry about anything.
- You're great!
- l'm in a rush. l hate to leave you.
l appreciate this.
The car is really important today.
- Call me tonight?
- Yes. Don't worry.
- Take care.
- Talk to you later, then?
- You'll call tonight?
- Yeah.
You'll call me tonight?
- Stephanie, this got me fired.
- What?
You couldn't do it on Sunday,
so my boss fired me.
l wanted everything in,
so l could fix it up on Saturday.
Nobody bitched at my office.
l got the whole day off.
- l'm sorry.
- lt's all right. l can handle it.
Come on in.
Put that over here.
- Hey!
- l thought you'd be out of town.
l postponed the trip.
Jay, this is my friend Tony Manero.
This is Jay Langhart.
Unspecified status. How do you do?
- l'm leaving you all the furniture.
- Are you kidding?
You picked out most of it anyway.
- Well, super.
- Nobody says super any more!
- Can l get you a beer, a glass of wine?
- No, it's all right.
- l read that book you told me to read.
- Kerr or Lawson?
- Kerr.
- You should've read the Lawson.
lf l can help you guys move in,
l'll be glad to help.
l'll get the rest.
- Who is that guy?
- He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films. He's moving
to a more expensive apartment.
l met him at the agency.
He didn't want his wife to know what
money he had until after the divorce.
- Come on, let's go.
- l meant, who is he to you?
He's a friend of mine. He's a friend.
l was living with him for a little while.
Are you in love with him?
Tell me the story.
No! We had a thing, it didn't work out
and it's over now, but he still likes me.
He likes to have you around
for a quick piece.
He helped me! lt's crazy at that place.
You don't know shit!
l didn't know how to do stuff,
so l'd ask him and he'd tell me.
And it would be all right.
Otherwise l'd be like an idiot,
saying, ''l don't know.'' He helps me.
Does he help you
get in and out of the sack?
He helped me. What the hell do you
expect me to do? What do you expect?
He helped me.
Don't cry about it. All right,
so he helped you. That's good for you.
Let's get out of here.
l`m sorry.
lt`s all right.
Don`t worry about anything.
Don`t worry about that.
Stephanie, don't.
- We'll stop here for a while.
- No, don't stop. Just take me home.
No, we'll just sit here for a while.
Don't worry about anything.
lt's pretty, isn't it?
Sit down.
Do you know how tall that bridge is?
That tower goes up 690 feet.
40 million cars go across a year.
1 27,000 tons of steel is involved in that.
lt's almost three quarters of a million
yards of concrete. That's right.
The centre span is 4,260 feet long.
With the on-ramps,
it all totals two and a half miles.
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?
l know everything about that bridge.
Know what else?
There's a guy buried in the cement.
Really?
Know how it happened?
While they were working on it,
pouring the cement,
he slipped off on the upper part
of the bridge and, you know, fell in.
Dumb fuck.
- What a way to go.
- l come here a lot. l get ideas.
What kind of ideas do you get?
l dunno...daydreams.
l daydream a lot.
Mr Fusco, l've come
for what l've got coming.
- Things got hot under the collar.
- What do you mean?
l don't want to lose you. You're a good
kid. The customers like you. Stay.
- l'm not fired?
- No. Come on.
- Unbelievable!
- You've got a future here.
Harold's been here 1 8 years,
since l opened. Mike, 1 5 years!
Give Harold a hand.
He's making a mess of it.
What are you doing?
- Trying to get up to 70% ?
- Whoa, man!
l didn't know
you hung your label on her!
That guy's the biggest cunt hound
in Bay Ridge.
- My God, l've been in serious danger!
- lt's no joke. He's a sleazy whore.
- l was dancing with him. Dancing.
- No, no, forget it.
- Let's dance.
- You disgust me.
What do you mean?
l was just dancing with the guy!
- Tony!
- What do you want?
Just look.
Jesus!
Beautiful! There are six,
seven of them and chicks.
- Let's wait until there are three or four.
- One or two?
- Tony!
- l'm thinking.
- Tony...
- Shut up!
- Back up.
- What are you doing, Double J?
- Backing up.
- Are you crazy?
- l'm getting married.
- Shut up!
Come on, fuckers!
Tony!
- Joey!
- Tony, help me! Please, God!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Tony, come here! lt's me. Come on!
- Let's get outta here!
He chickened! Where is he?
Go, man, go!
- Where the hell were you?
- l was just driving around.
l was looking for you.
- Did you get the number of the truck?
- Don't make me laugh.
- Look. We don't love you, right?
- We got them.
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.
- Did you really kick their asses?
- We got them, ltalian style.
That's great. Except, you know,
l'm not so sure it was the Barracudas.
- You said it was.
- No, l said it probably was.
Don't pull our legs.
We can get into trouble for that.
You said it probably was.
Yes, but it could have been
the Spanish Barons.
Stupid bastard!
We almost got our heads busted.
Yeah? Not you, lover.
- You've got some fucking pair of balls!
- l had to lay somebody out for it.
- Are you stupid? Didn't you see them?
- lf l didn't say who, they'd gotten off!
Fuck you, Gus! Do you know what?
l feel like breaking your broken leg!
Oh, God, l can't believe it!
- l could have killed him.
- You couldn't kill crab lice!
- Do you think l'm a coward?
- What do you think you are?
Enough of that shit!
l'm bored with it, all right?
Hey, look at this. You're beautiful, babe!
We've got the winners here.
Let's get a table.
- How are you doing?
- l'm all right.
- What happened to your face?
- l cut myself shaving.
- With a switchblade, huh?
- Come on.
A big hand for Shirley Charles
and Chester Bronson!
Be cool, everybody.
No way! No good!
Now we have Stephanie Mangano
and Tony Manero!
- Joey, give me another one of those.
- You've had enough.
- All right, get high. lt's your head.
- That's right.
Hey! Hey, be cool!
Now we have couple number 1 5!
The Puerto Rican couple.
María Héctor y César Rodríguez!
- Wrong neighbourhood!
- Tony, you'll take the prize.
- They're so fucking good.
- They're spics!
Look at them, greasing up the floor.
Número uno!
- No contest!
- Bullshit. They were better than us.
- No, they were just different.
- Bullshit.
Folks, we have the judges' decision.
ln third place we have Elizabeth
and Joseph Cursa. Give them a hand!
Second prize! From Puerto Rico,
César Rodríguez and María Héctor!
- You're doing them a favour!
- You'll take the prize.
Don't spend it in one place.
ln first place, the coolest, Brooklyn's
Fred Astaire, the boogie-woogie man.
He was hot! He was right on!
Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero!
We won!
Come on. Come on!
Come on, let's boogie!
- You put them down!
- You phoney bastards!
You know who should have won.
My friends can't be straight with me!
- Up your ass!
- We won it.
lt was rigged. That's like family.
They can't give it to a spic, a stranger!
- We were just as good, and l know it.
- You think so?
Come with me.
Excuse me.
Congratulations. l'd like to give you this,
because l think you deserve it.
- lf the spics are good, they deserve it.
- But we won!
This is a fucking shithole!
The assholes l hang out with.
l can't believe them sometimes.
Everybody has to dump on somebody!
Nobody can do it straight, right?
My pa gets dumped on at work,
so he dumps on my mother.
The spics dump on us,
so we have to dump on them.
Everybody's dumping on everybody.
Even the humping is dumping.
- All right, tell me what's wrong.
- Get in. Get in!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Stop it!
- Leave me alone. Get away!
- You're such a fucking cockteaser.
- Don't call me that!
- Why do you hang around with me?
- Dancing.
- Dancing? Why else?
You want to know? lt's bullshit!
l've been dumping my bullshit on you.
Selling my act on you. Making
you think l love you. lt's all bullshit!
- You fucking cunt!
- You stop it! Don't!
Get off me!
Oh, Stephanie.
- l'm mad at you, Tony.
- Annette's giving everybody snatch pie!
- The fuck you are.
- What are you doing?
What is with you? And you, you punk?
You little fuck!
- What is it?
- You don't give a shit about her!
Annette, get in the car.
Go on. Do it.
l told you.
You can fuck all night on speed.
- Joey, what are you doing?
- The first is always the best.
Come on, Double J. You're up.
See you guys later.
Come on! We'll have a good time.
l don't want to do it.
Fuck!
Shit! With me she cries.
- Goddamn, Annette.
- No, don't. No, no.
Yeah!
Double J !
Come on, Double J !
A beer!
With no pants and no hands!
Beer!
Fuck you, Manhattan!
Come to Brooklyn!
- Mine's so big l have to strap it down.
- Anita says mine is the biggest in town.
Are you proud of yourself, Annette?
ls that what you wanted? Good.
Now you're a cunt.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Come on, Annette. l'm sorry.
- l said l'm sorry.
- l didn't want to do it.
- Look at this guy! Bobby, you punk!
- Tony!
- Look at me!
- Bobby, get down! lt's too dangerous.
Look at me, Tony!
Look at me! Hey, Tony!
- l'm not kidding. Get down from there.
- l'm all right.
l'm all right, Tony. l'm all right.
Watch me.
- Tony, look at me.
- Now you're being crazy.
- Look at me. l'm doing it!
- lt's dangerous.
Look at me!
Oh, Jesus.
Give me your hand. Come back in.
- Watch!
- Don't! You're making me nervous.
Don't do that.
Get over here right now. l mean it!
Jesus, no!
- l did it.
- What?
- l did it.
- What?
Get over here right now. Come on.
- Don't be upset. We'll talk in the car.
- You didn't talk to me before.
How come you never called me?
- l didn't want to fuck up.
- You didn't. We'll talk.
l didn't want to fuck up this time.
Any of you think
maybe he killed himself?
There are ways of killing yourself
without killing yourself.
You can go now.
Forget the number, Chief.
We won't find anything tonight.
Shit.
Tone?
Hey, Tony!
Stephanie?
- ls that you?
- Yeah, it's me.
- l'm really sorry about last night.
- You're sorry?
Yeah, l'm sorry.
lt won't happen again, l promise.
- l really need to talk to you.
- What do you mean by that?
Just like l said, l need to talk to you.
lf l open the door,
you won't pull anything on me, right?
No, of course not.
First time l've let a rapist in.
l'll just stay right here. That way
you don't think l'm going to jump you.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing. l'll tell you later.
You can't just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.
l've been up all night, walking around.
l'm going to get myself my own place.
l'm getting my money and coming back.
Why don't you sit down? Come on.
- So what are you doing?
- l'm not going back there.
- They're assholes. l'm fed up with it.
- OK. What are you going to do?
You get a job. Do what you do.
Get a nice apartment.
OK. What kind of job?
l don't know. What did you do?
You couldn't do anything.
l could type.
l'm an able person.
l can do these things.
Of course you can.
Tony, l want to tell you something.
You know, l said all that stuff
to you about...
...using you, practising my act on you.
lt wasn't true. There were other reasons
why l was hanging around you.
- What do you mean?
- You made me feel better.
You gave me admiration, you know?
Respect. Support.
Stephanie, maybe now,
when l'm going to be in town,
maybe we could see each other.
l don't mean like that. l know you're
thinking l'm promoting your pussy.
l mean like friends. Like you said:
we could help each other.
- You want to be friends?
- l'd like to be friends with you.
Do you think you know how?
Do you think you could be friends
with a girl? Could you stand that?
The truth? l don't know.
l could try. That's all l can say.
OK.
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.
All right.
Friends, man.
