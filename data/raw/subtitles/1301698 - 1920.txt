It's a  saying that man
can avoid his shadow.
.. but not from his past.
He can avoid his doings
but can't avoid his destiny.
Avoid unfortunate events but
can't avoid fortunate events.
You can't set off fortunate
events. Neither do I.
That's another thing to understand this circle
of like I have to go to the brinks of death.
Maybe you can't believe this thing..
.. but I believe in it.
Yes I believe in this.
No see..
I'm 1000 miles away from here..
.. but who can say by looking at
the wilderness of this mansion.
That what is about to happen over here
today, can affect my life and death.
Is there anybody?
The rope is hanging sir.
Bring sahib's luggage.
Okay.
Greetings sir.
Since years ago somebody check the
king but king refuses to surrender.
- I'm the owner of this mansion.
- Owner..
I'm not the owner call me the servant.
Owner is Ather Singh JaisawaI.
.. few year ago he
purchased this mansion.
Now he lives in Calcutta  like a king and I
are obeying his orders like infantry soldiers.
Now king ordered, send a letter
to the biggest architect company
of Delhi. So I ask Athar and
Machanda and called you here.
Don't you face any problem
in the way Mita I Sahib?
No.
I hadn't face any problem.
By the way you have
such a lofty mansion.
You only have to convert
it into a lofty hotel.
For the foreigners who'll pass from here.
Hotel will be that much excellent M.K.
Sahib. So foreigners should pass from here.
Wow! Excellent sir.
You this sentence laid the
foundation of our hotel.
By the way I heard that some other
architect visited here prior to me?
Yes, he visited but he didn't
have the guts like you have.
Okay, I'm leaving.
If you need anything,
this is Balwant. Ask him.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
And yes when you will
going to start the work?
From tonight.
Who's around?
Balwant.
Dear Lisa  that was my
biggest mistake to come here.
Nothing has been changed over here.
I came here in search of a
father but I met with a hood.
Since years baring the weight of
his family and principals, a big hood.
Love can be taught to
humans not to hoods.
If you want to avoid cuffs
that no need to argue with them.
.. have to cut them.
Today I'm coming to pick you up..
.. and we can't get
blessings of my father.
.. but as we'll reach to Mumbai
we'll get Lord blessings and marry.
Love.. Arjun.
Grab him.
- Bhaiya .
- Arjun.
- Get out.
- Bhaiya listen to me.
Bhaiya .. Bhaiya listen to me.
- Come out.
- No Bhaiya .
Arjun.. Arjun.
- Leave Arjun.
- Leave me Bhaiya .
- You already did too much.
- Bhaiya listen to me.
- Arjun.
- Bhaiya nothing goes wrong with her.
- Arjun.
- Bang him more.
- Arujun.
- Bhaiya do nothing with Lisa .
Arjun.
- Arjun.
- Bhaiya .
Arjun.. Arjun stop.. Arjun.
Listen.
Stop.. Stop.. Arjun.
Stop.
Will you raise your hand on
your uncle for this abject girl?
If somebody do the same with my mother
in front of your then what you do?
Stupid, you are comparing this
a bject girl with your mother.
You are comparing
religion and love, Babu-ji.
I just want to marry only.
- With that girl, whom I'm in love.
- Don't shout loud.
If somebody will hear this then nobody from
7 villages will come to own your sisters.
Our family, our respect, our
status will ruin to the ground.
What do you need most your son's
happiness or your family respect?
That a bject magic is talking..
It's our fault. The day we
found out her mother went with
.. some foreigner, we socially
boycott her and anathematized her.
.. and pay mercy to the baby which she
have in her belly. we left her mother alive.
lf, same day we kill that abject so today
that abject blood hasn't showed its colors.
Enough Babuji.
You are disgracing my would be wife.
You are disgracing your customs.
You forget that our religion
is different. Doing are
different. Preaching is different.
Even our Lord is different.
For the Lord I asked
you with due opulent..
Will you disgrace that Lord?
Will you displease the same Lord?
Yes.
If some religion..
any custom..
any Lord..
will take away my love so I
don't need that kind of Lord.
That Lord whom I accept my all and
all and exercise him day and night..
If today, he come in-between my love
than I don't need that kind of Lord.
That Lord who assist a person with his
name to allow him to take somebody's life..
.. I don't need such kind of Lord.
Accept it like this father
that today, you lose one son.
And for that Lord one man has
died while trying to kill him.
That's nice you come.
Look this, this royal blue will
work with this wall. Won't it be?
- Do such like this.. Royal blue..
- What are you doing? What happen?
Come, you sit here.
To, Mr Arujun Singh.. As
you have been informed..
.. that Rai Bahduar Athar
Singh Jaisawal mansion
in Palum Pur has been
transformed into a lofty hotel.
And Rai Bahadur sahib granted
this responsibility to our company.
.. that's why you name has been
suggested in committee meeting.
and in accordance to that a 20%
increment in your salary has been decided.
Shiyam Lal Sosodiya .
Can you believe this?
I'll design that complete
mansion according to my style.
Its interiors..
.. its exteriors..
I'll make a II of them.
always wanted something like this.
You know Lisa you are
really lucky for me.
Just a minute hang on.. stop.. stop..
Why somebody want to do that?
What?
Why somebody want to destroy
that such a beautiful mansion?
Lisa why do you want to kick my job?
Lisa  right now you see this but you haven't
seen that what I'm watching from here.
You'll see Lisa such a beautiful
hotel will come out from
here and you'll forget that
ever a mansion stood up here.
Let's go.
Lisa .. hello.
Lisa .
It's our custom to receive
our gust but M.K sir had an
urgent piece of work so that's
why he's unable to hit station.
But he asked for forgiveness.
I heard that weather stays
same from the place you belong.
But its different
over here on mountains.
If it's Lord will then sun come out early in the
morning otherwise it don't come out for weeks.
and there is too much cold during this.
But I stocked too many woods in the store
so you don't have to worry for 2 months.
And electricity isn't
present over here, isn't it?
It's coming and will
be here in one year.
It's already been at Chawa I over here.
It'll hit soon.
- This one.
- What are you doing?
I apply all the keys of this
mansion and this door isn't working.
Try in the light of the morning.
Maybe It open.
Okay, Balwant serve the food.
Okay.
Who is it?
Who is it?
What are you doing here?
There.. there is somebody up there.
- Is there somebody up?
- Yes.
Who will come over
here so late at night?
Lisa  again you dream
something, isn't it?
No Arujun, I heard
somebody voice in reality.
- Like somebody is in so much pain and he..
- Please this is hilly area ..
.. strange kind of voice come out
when air rushes through at night.
Now go to sleep.
I have to get up early in the
morning and go to meet M.K. Sahib.
Lets go.
I love you Lisa .
Don't miss me too much.
- I love you too.
- Bye.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
I'm tell you this door is open.
I went into it.
I saw each and everything inside.
There is a wall with a big painting.
There is a big piano in front
of it and I play that piano.
Arjun you know that
I speaking the truth.
Lisa who is saying that you are lying.
It's an old door, yesterday
it work and today it isn't..
What is the need to be so shocked in it?
If everything is fine in this mansion so
what is the need of construction over here.
I accept it that you went there and you
saw the painting and you play the piano.
I believe on your every word.
You aren't understanding Arjun since we come
here strange things are going on with me.
There is something in this home,
which I can sense but I can't touch.
sometime I want to follow him and
sometime I want to run away from him.
Are you getting what I'm saying?
Lisa .. come.
Lisa  I know since we come
here you aren't happy.
Your body is here but your
heart always stay in Mumbai.
Lisa, this job is very important for me..
But not more then you.
If you want then stay for few
more days otherwise we'll go back.
You are out of your mind.
You are getting money for your
efforts not for your advice.
Do you know how much money Rai
Sahib has spent on this job?
I only know that these
people life is in danger.
Previously you didn't agree with me. Just because
of your stubbornness two people lost their lives.
This mention don't want
to be demolish, master.
This will not spare them too..
There is some super natural..
some sprit in that house.
Shut up Balwant.
I'm not illiterate like you.
I don't believe on such kind of stuff.
If you don't believe on it then why
you live over here instead of there?
You know everything and you are
pushing those people without any reason.
You also live there, why that
sprit hasn't bother you till now?
Because I don't want to
demolish that mansion, master.
Last time hear it Balwant this mansion will be
demolished and Hotel must be constructed on it.
.. and if you open your mouth so remember,
this place is small and people need jobs.
Excuse me father.
Yes.
Father that cross.. a bit.
This is the outcome of last night storm.
Stairs are already broken so I can't do
anything and when Peter and Simon will
come in evening then something will be done.
Sorry.
I felt that you haven't
saw it that's why.
No, that's perfectly alright my dear.
I never see you before.
Yes, few days ago we come here.
- That's Rai sahib's mansion, isn't it?
- Yes.. yes.
My husband is going to demolish
it and build a new hotel there.
Oh I see!
What's your name my dear?
Lisa Singh Rathod.
Lisa Singh or Rathod.
That's very interesting.
So will you come alone on Sunday mass
or your husband will come along with you.
What happened my child?
When I woke up at hospital then
everything was been changed.
For me Arjun left everything.
His parents, his home, his everything.
Even his Lord too.
Whom Arjun exercise since childhood.
First time I saw love and
hatred together in Arjun eyes.
At that time I wasn't been able explain
anything to him so I understood everything.
Don't know we did good or bad.
Don't know God already
forgive us or not.
- Greetings, Ma'am.
- Greetings.
- Greetings Ma'am.
- Greetings.
Lisa you were saying right, painting
and piano is present over here.
But that door isn't here
which was disturbing you.
Look how much I take care of you.
This door was disturbing
you so I break this door.
Now this mansion will disturb
you I'll demolish this house too.
Thanks, smile come on your face.
I told you that you'll feel
good when you go outside.
Is it good?
Please..
Since I come here I'm not feeling well.
Do you know why?
Because since I come here
you haven't hug me properly.
That day when I hugged her I wasn't aware
of that she was standing miles away from me.
I hug her but I couldn't
felt his inner silence.
I wish I can understand her properly.
Lisa.. Lisa.
Lisa .
Lisa .
First I felt that all
this is my illusion.
But after yesterday I believe that
somebody is living in that mansion.
Yesterday I heard him.
I saw him.
He was standing in front of me Father.
I'm very scared.
I'm really scared.
Do you tell all this to Arjun?
No Father, if won't trust
on me that I'll mind it.
And If he believe then he will mind.
He'll leave everything
and take me to Mumbai.
He loses in his life after getting me.
First time he gets
happiness by coming here.
If don't want to steal his
career and joy from him.
I understand that you don't have
any other way except to live there.
That's why I come to you.
Can you please help me Father?
Stay here.
Good morning Lisa .
Good morning Father.
- Father Arjun is out only for 2 hours.
- Okay. You stay here.
- What happen, Father?
- Lisa, old mansions are like old people.
.. who stays quiet for years and see
so many things with their own eyes.
Something good and something bad..
Something very bad.
Sometimes evil leave by
leaving his shadow in eyes.
Maybe that mansion saw so many things.
Suffered so many things.
But now you have no need to worry.
I blessed this house my dear.
Now you and your husband
can live here peacefully.
Thank you father.
My pleasure.
MOAS TU'YA VETA MIYA
This is Latin phrase..
and meanings are, 'your death my life'.
Means sprit is threaten
us in our language.
It seems that some old enmity
is between this sprit and
that girl and she don't want
anybody to come in-between them.
Lisa Ma'am is not around at home Father.
She left for Delhi with sir.
- When she'll be back?
- Within a week or so.
Look listen to me carefully..
.. as your ma'am come back from
Delhi tell her to come and meet me.
I have to tell her
something about this home.
If she spent one more night in this house without
meeting me then her life will be in real danger.
Understand?
Yes.
Why you stop over here?
Just a  minute.
Yes.
You can't go ahead.
Why?
Ahead British soldiers and
freedom fighters are in a battle.
It'll be dangerous for you.
Ma'am you haven't left..
No there was some problem in the
way so Sahib has to leave alone.
Balwant I'll take my food in my room.
Ma'am.. after you left.. some..
What happen Balwant? Was somebody came?
No I turn off the stove.
So that's why food takes some time.
No problem.
Devendierji what is
the need to do all this.
Don't you worry, you'll get
the cement and iron contract.
This isn't the matter of business,
it's a matter of hospitality.
Absolutely Arjun..
And whenever you visit Delhi
and hasn't seen Bichwa's
dance show then Delhi will
have a complaint with you.
If you say then I'll call him again.
go quick,
Okay.
Mrs. Rathore!
Mrs. Rathore!
flu is very high.
After normal examintaion it seems
that she has a influenza .
but we have to check there is not
any other infection.
we'll check till tomorrow morning
rather you have to admit her.
and you were saying that she didn't
anything since 2 days, Yes.
feed here anyhow otherwise infection
could be increase.
Lisa !
Lisa !
Lisa ! Balwan!!!!
Mr. Arjun!
Yeah!
Who are you?
I'm the common man sent by God.
who have seen today in church what
is really not a common thing,
God is bleeding for one of his
children.
I don't understand,
But I understand God's messages.
He wants to save his child, and that
child is in this house.
Lisa!
Can I meet to Lisa?
Lisa!
Yes, Lisa.
You don't know but I already met Lisa,
I want to help her,
May I?
You shouldn't pay attention to him,
your wife needs medical attention.
As soon as possible we have to take
Lisa hospital.
I am asking just 5 minutes.
I just need to meet Lisa once.
Lisa!
I told you,
I told you to came into your house,
tell me didn't I told you,
tell me why did you came here,
get lost from here, get lost,
There is a devil inside her body,
Look! I am not against medical
science,
but this time she don't need doctor's
help but of God,
Look! I respect you, whatever you want
to do then do it
I won't interfere but let me do my
job,
But I am not interferring anyone.
I am just trying to save that girl's
life, her life is in danger.
And as long I've seen the world
as long you've seen that's just inside
your church,
come outside from there watch,
On other side people like Sigman fat
who are working on person disorder,
and another way people like you,
who always talks like frog of wall.
In this condition many times patient
behaves like two people and it's also
happening with Lisa.
But why she makes two voices, and
one voice is devil's,
because there are two vocal cords
in human body.
Primary and Secondary, and human
uses one both of them.
Because of Personality disorder...
Lisa...
There is a devil inside Lisa's body.
because when I touch that cross on her
forehead she... she's cluttered.
Yes!
because she has a high flu.
And in that condition if you touched
a wood instead of cross then she must
do the same.
Why you poeple don't listening to me,
Excuse us, father.
Mr. Arjun. she is your wife and you
have to decide.
Ambulance is waiting outside and if
we wouldn't take her hospital at a
moment then even I can't help you
anymore.
Leave us on our condition.
It's good that I brought her here.
Flu is much less and I think she will
be normal till next morning.
You mean I can take her home till
tomorrow evening.
The condition is that priest shouldn't
come again.
Lisa!
Lisa! what's happening to you?
hold her, hold her.
hold her tight,
hold her hand tight.
What are you doing Kalan?
Shocked?
You shocked to hear your childhood
name,
Not just yours I knew your entire
family name.
Your father Ramnath was a gardner
in Bari Baghiya.
Your mother Kaushaliya.
She was a sweeper in Gober Mal's
palace,
Your Grandpa Harkisandas,
who was cleaning a shit of Ghore's
horse,
and one day he was caught in bed
with Ghore's daughter.
Ghore make him tied with horse let
him seven rounds of palace,
You are also the blood of him,
So what if you didn't get caught,
You also did the same thing with you
Big Boss's daughter,
You brought her here,
and here on this very bed,
to gave her injection,
you did thrice with her....
My fight was with my God,
but what was Lisa's fault, If
something happened to me instead of
her, then will she pray to God for
me,
Maybe Yes,
Maybe Lisa was doing to make me
happy that she didn't ask to God,
But I knew it,
She still kept a God inside her heart
If she would be on my place,
then she wouldn't take out Father
Thomas,
I knew it,
I will never beg to my God,
But how could I snitch this right
from Lisa.
Before coming here I made a promise
with her that I'll never come between
her and God a d now the time has
come to fulfill.
I'm sorry Father, I didn't behave
well with you that day,
Lisa needs your help today.
Whoever you are?
I know you're listening me,
What do you want?
Why did you came inside this girl's
body,
four days,
just four days more,
after that this body won't be useful
for me,
If something happened to Lisa then
I won't spare you alive too,
Tell me what more you know about
that house,
I'm telling you,
Mr. Rai bought that house two years
before.
that time one old lady lived here.
Possible she would tell you something,
But where she's gone,
Naya Nagar no, Nawanagar.
Lisa needed me this time,
But I needed to know the truth to
save her life.
that's why I left her responsibility
on Father Thomas.
and I went out for Nawanagar.
Where this Radhama lives,
She lives here.
I came from Palanpur.
Can I talk to you?
after two days there is a full
moon night.
If you didn't help me.
then I couldn't save my wife.
You have to tell me,
that what is the truth of that palace,
What happened there?
But it seems God is angry,
Palanpur's fortune
has written be evil's own hand,
I don't understand,
some
It's a story of 60-70 years before.
Year of 1857.
everything was getting change rapidly.
down to the entire Hindustan's golden
veil,
against the injustice of English men,
slowly slowly a voice was creating,
voice of Revolution.
Gayatri's father Rai Bahadur Pratab
Singh.
Like other Indians, to leave his
house and prope
was busy in the battle of freedom,
Rai Sahab has gone with other men to
left his house responsibility on my
Mom,
My mom was suppose to be a servant,
but after Rai Sahab's wife death,
She grown up Gayatri like mother,
That time in that big palace only
we three people lived,
My Mom,
Gayatri and me,
He is also a putschist soldier,
Like your father,
He is also fighting for freedom,
After get shot his courage didn't
get low,
He wants to go back in his area when
he'll become fine,
but till then he needs hideout,
He wants that....
There is a place in this house for
every soldier.
who wants to see freedom of India.
He can stay here as longer he wants,
Thanks.
I brought a message,
Rai Sahab has sent a letter,
He will take more time,
Bad news,
In Dolatpur, English men attacked our
sleeping soldiers
and captured that area ,
Once again someone betray us.
some our own man give them information
about his own soldiers.
and our 90 soldiers become mar.
We will never win,
We will win,
We will must win.
Who are you?
Maybe some glass has broke,
I am going to call Kaisarma,
She is not here.
Actually, I wa s bringing her messa ge
to you,
Unfortunately she have to go to city
for 2 days.
Some relative of her was ill.
You were sleeping, that's why
she left her message to me,
But Kaisarma didn't....
But whatever I want to say,
I will definitely say before leaving,
after 2 days.
I will go for Dolatpur.
But after leaving
you people
I will miss you very much,
Whatever you have done for me,
I will never forget.
What happen?
Soldier Mohan,
Luetant is very happy for what you
have done,
if you didn't inform us on right time,
then Dolatpur's Putschist will be
succeed in their plans,
We can't go like this,
If we will go,
then he will safely go,
What else we can do?
not us,
Me,
I will stop him,
You know the Bismal Chacha's palace.
give this letter to him,
and tell as soon as possible raise it
to Baba.
But what you will do?
When human fell down so much
and it's hard to get him up
then to stop him
sometimes we have to fall down
with him,
Go! Radha,
Go!
after that day,
Rai Sahab locked that room forever,
And send Gayatri to her grandma 's
house.
what sacrifices Gayatri gave for
country.
she have to bear that's punishment
for life time.
because of that night to spent with
a traitor
she have been forced to live alone,
Nor she get someone's love,
neither she got married.
I lived in that palace for 35-40 years,
one day I found this letter there.
It was written in that
Gayatri has died after long illness,
18 Nov 1996.
that same day Lisa was born,
Why somebody wants to demolish such
a nice house.
there.
there is something what I can't touch
but I can definitely feel that.
Lisa is not someone else but she is
Gayatri,
She reach to palanpur to take second
birth,
And that roaming spirit is soldier
Mohan.
Spirit recognize spirit,
Devil change the nature.
we have only 24 hours.
tomorrow is a full moon night,
which spirit waited 60 years to take
revenge,
there is only one way to stop him,
and what's that?
Exorcism,
What is that?
With God's power to take out devil
from human body.
It's not so simple,
You knew it,
We have to write a letter to Bishop,
have to explain him complete situation
have to wait for his permission,
But it will take two weeks and we
have only today's day,
whatever,
Without Bishop's permission we can't
do exorcism,
But this time if we didn't save that
girl's life then it will be a big sin
You don't understand me,
To do Exorcism,
it's out of our reach.
To fight with devil, we need strength
You are taking this step against our
religion,
and if something happen to that girl
then you will be only responsible for
her death, At this time
I'm just thinking about her life.
Before we enter inside we have to
care about one thing,
Our fight is against devil not with
Lisa.
Devils is inside Lisa's body.
He will try to make us fool.
he will distract us,
Possible Lisa will cry on fornt of us
beg to us,
shout on us,
try to make us weak,
but we have to be strong.
and we have to remember that he is
a devil.
not Lisa.
We have to tie her hands.
Father!
don't take it out,
if it will stay then blood will be
stop for awhile.
don't worry about me you go and
save Lisa.
he will kill her,
but father you...
nothing will happen to me,
My God is with me.
Give me my stole,
cure was already useless,
and now there is no more priest,
I am going to my Gayatri along,
How would you save your Lisa?
with my love's strength.
Have you seen your love's strength.
Your love is going so far to leave
you forever.
Would you like to meet her last time.
Would you like to meet her last time.
He will take me along.
I don't wanna go leave you alone.
Save me to do something.
Please save me please.
that day to save my love from human,
I fought with God,
there was no mistake of human
nor God,
mistake was devil like you,
who came in the human face and trying
to snitch my love,
and you still doing the same thing
today,
But you can't cheat me this time,
If today I have to achieve my love,
then I have to correct my that day
mistake,
I won't let you snitch my Lisa.
from which God I always fought.
today I understand his one thing
very well.
He sent us all here for one moral.
Lisa didn't get her true love in her
last birth,
and to searching that love she came
in this birth,
but now maybe her goal is complete,
I have to save Lisa to went in her
past birth,
and have to fulfill promise her to
spend my life with her,
Maybe my goal is complete too,
Gayatri is going forever,
but before leaving she gave me the
finger of lisa in my hand.
Maybe her goal is complete too.
