The game is about to begin
''Eyes''
''are the strangest players
at the game... ''
''an exciting game... ''
''of eyes''
''What's the fun living in fear?''
''And l want to live it up''
''For weapons, eyes are useless... ''
''but useful for a change
of fortunes''
''And death is just a chance''
Could only be the work of a genius
As a model for our new office...
it's nice, even exotic.
But calling the architect a genius...
The architect never went to school
But by dint of his intellect and
hard work...
he has elevated this bank to an
institution of international repute
lt's designed by our general manager
for developments, Vijay Singh Aajput
He's a maniac
Six months from now, our bank is going
to shift into the new headquarters
Saturday, October 27. The shopping
malls here will be closed
The day when lndia and Pakistan
will be playing a cricket match
Stop calling him a maniac
He only suffers from schizophrenia.
- And it's incurable
And you know it very well.
And his madness is increasing
ln a rage, he's like a wild beast.
The other day, he beat up a guard
The guard was asleep on night duty.
- So he deserves to be clobbered?
Why are you taking sides with him?
He gave this bank a lifetime
with a single minded purpose. Growth
And so as not to be distracted,
Vijay Singh has remained a bachelor
Must've scared the girls away
With a maniac, who knows?
Ten am. Secure van to arrive here.
To be stowed, 4 containers of cash
One container of jewelry, diamonds,
from the safe deposit vaults
l told you! l'll call later.
Hang up
He will keep going on rampages,
you will go on protecting him
Mr. Bhandari is right.
ln the last 2 years...
Vijay Singh has battered 5 employees.
And the bank has been maligned too
No merely mad. Dangerous too
lt's an emergency. My wife is
in hospital, waiting to deliver
So...?
What are you doing here? Go
Strange, no?
Sweets, Mr. Aajput.
My wife has a son
Nice mood? Or are you in the mood
to batter someone?
The guard you mauled...
he doesn't sleep on duty anymore,
doesn't even lie down to sleep
Coconut water for Mr. Aajput
Where's the teller?
Ms Teller, have a sweet.
- What are you celebrating?
My wife has delivered a boy
Whom does he resemble?
Like a film star.
ln short, like me
You look just like a film star.
- Hey Ms Teller...
lf she says you look like a film star,
then you look like a film star
How much have you withdrawn?
- 10,000 as usual. Why?
You'll find a note less
No sir, l have her a counted bundle
Count it again.
- But l counted it
Sir! Come out, quick!
Trouble's brewing
Look
Ninety-nine
The missing note
is in your pocket
She is one of our oldest clients.
She never counts the bundles
Help
Don't ask me
Don't ask why l've been thrown
out of my bank
l am not surprised at all...
to announce the award for the employee
of the year
For the last 20 years, a lone man
has deserved this award
This 25th time, l'm just as happy
as l was when l first got the award
Truth. lt's so strange
The Vilas Aao Jefferson Bank.
l fathered this bank
Every moment of my life,
l have devoted to it, like a son
And they do this to me?
lngrates
Truth. Extraordinary, strange,
more bizarre than any imagination
A handful of people who set up shop
lending money
The thousands of clients
l got for them. l begged
Their customers, clients, furniture,
fixtures, the decor on the walls...
even the uniforms of the peons,
Managers, clerks, tellers...
l decided
ln return, they insulted me.
l shall give them a fitting reply
Truth, that seemingly new, strange
phenomenon that dazzles us
The lifeblood of the bank is
my blood. That blood l shall draw
l'll plan the world's
most astounding bank robbery
This bank is going to go bust.
l'm not leaving a single cent behind
l'll clean out the vaults,
l'll ruin this bank
Truth, surreal, incomprehensible
And that we fear the most
Getting into the bank and turning it
inside out is ruled out. l know
But surely there's a way to reach
my objective. The V. J. Bank
Of improbabilities,
there are also some
that venture into the realm
of the truth
l will hit the heart of the bank,
the safe deposit vaults
And l'm no Vijay Singh Aajput
unless l outdo the obstacle course
An incredible, extraordinary,
unimaginable, unforeseen act...
is about to come true
A dangerous truth
There must be a way to attain
my objective. lt's here, somewhere
l am going to get even
My vengeance l shall have
How?
Careful
Aahul, tug hard at the cord.
The sound of bells must be heard
Aemember, balance is of
utmost importance
lt's your victory
Arun, careful now
Balance is important
Try to hear the bells
That pot is the head office
of Vilas Aao Jefferson
The blind boys are my weapons.
My retort
lncomparable
And you?
- Neha Srivastav
And who's this lovely boy?
- My little brother, Aahul
Brother...?
Workshop for the blind?
Are you sure the word
will reach the blind?
When will the advertisement
be published?
Day after
Where is my brother?
- Pawned
l'm holding your brother hostage
For the 5 million l'm giving you...
l'm going to hold something valuable
in lien
What can be more precious to you
than your brother?
What are you saying...?
- Do not understand?
You will, understand everything
l'm going to give you
all of 5 million
You will use your faculties
to train 3 blind men for me
What for?
For the most bizarre bank robbery
in the world
What...?
Cannot believe it?
No one will be able to believe it
Who'd expect blind men to
rob millions from a bank...
in broad daylight?
But it will happen
The truth...
is unimaginable
Always
Look, this is impossible.
Why are you joking?
l have invited the blind
from all over the country...
to participate in a unique workshop.
l advertised
They'll be given all kinds of training.
- Why do you refuse to listen?
On completion, they will be given
scholarships, employment
Why are you doing this to my brother?
- lt's a lot of money
To qualify, answer a question.
What is your ambition?
And to what extent will they go
to achieve their ambitions?
That's the criteria for selection
Several applicants.
But only three
Only three men are willing...
to go to any extent...
to achieve their ambitions
One, Arjun Varma
As a kid l played football
With my friends
No more football,
no friends either
Because l've lost my sight
After my parents died,
l was brought up by my uncle
But l had to grow up
all by myself
When l was a child...
my uncle's blind son
And l was blinded
ln the annals of history,
no worse a betrayal, l suppose
But someday l will see..
to see what makes your world more
beautiful than mine
That's my biggest...
ambition
l don't care! l want to know...
- llyas. Your second student
This is a first class compartment
l told you, this is first class.
- My song is first class too
You think you're clever?
- Are the blind stupid?
Get lost
Don't you shove me!
You belong in third class
May you get cancer!
And may you die of AlDS
Train's gone, llyas.
Stop screaming
Got him scared
He's going straight
to hospital...
for a cancer check-up
Stop wasting your time
and buy a lottery ticket
Try it out, for a change of luck.
- Luck will change only when...
l get a nice dress, with pockets
in pants and money in pockets
Cash
Come what may, you got to
make money in life
Essential.
-Just let me come into the cash
By Allah, l'll buy air tickets.
l'll buy me a first class suit
And l'll sing English songs
to beg for a living
That Michael Jackson song
Third and last.
And most interesting
Most dangerous too, maybe
Vishwas Prajapati. Very interesting
tale. 3 years ago, he could see
''There are sins''
''There are passions''
''There's ecstasy''
''Take what you want''
''Forget everything''
''Break this silence''
''The pulsating heartbeat''
''That fiery breath''
''Give me that love''
''Give in to passion''
''My love... ''
''Here's sin, passion, ecstasy''
''Wayward desire... ''
''at heart, l seek
to die for you, my love''
''l'm afraid... ''
''am l in heaven?''
''Take me in your arms... ''
''and never stop''
''Break down the walls''
''Swing the seasons''
''Let go, to drown
my love''
''ln your embrace... ''
''some realizations,
some ardour... ''
''some fire, some burning... ''
''some faltering steps''
God, that lowliest of merchants
traded my sight for a unique gift
Sixth sense
My sixth sense warns that...
your advertisement isn't a
mere workshop
There's more to it
Something sinister
That's why l am drawn
Whether you invite me or not...
l'm coming
The three of them
They're coming to see you tomorrow.
- Look...
l will look. To see how you prepare
the three of them to execute...
the biggest bank heist
l look forward to see how you'll
make my dream come true
But l will only be a
passive observer
Never, under no circumstance they
are to know who pulls the strings
You start training them tomorrow
You're deranged! l'm no part
of this insanity
Didi (Sister)
Save me
What are you doing?
- Tomorrow morning. Nine
Let me see Aahul, please!
For once...
Take me out of here
Anyone in?
That's all the English l can manage.
Spare the cuss words. Talk business
Pay before the sweat is dried.
What's the money like?
Money? Pay me what you like
Asking to get paid? By a beggar?
Clever! Are you a politician?
What are you saying?
- l go singing for supper
lt's a harmonium, no talisman.
Fuck your mother
lnsolence! You know l can't see.
- You're blind too?
Then who's doing the workshop?
Listen... this is a misunderstanding
- Misunderstanding...?
l'm here for the training too
So we've been taking each other
literally? Are you as blind as l am?
Wonderful!
- Come and sit here
Where?
- Here
First class. l'm sitting bro
Sorry to be late.
- Are you blind too?
No...
- Then you're the trainer. Talk
l advertised
You...?
- Vishwas Prajapati
Your uninvited guest.
- Welcome. l'm Neha Srivastav
And they...
- Arjun Varma
And l'm llyas. Make do.
- And you...?
l'm Neha Srivastav.
- Not you. The fourth person
Fourth? No one here but us
Would you like water?
- l'd like a strong tea
What's this workshop, Ms Neha?
- For us, dangerous and profitable
We might end up making millions.
That's why the first meeting is here
And not at any training center,
right Ms Neha?
What insolence is this?
- The glass slipped
lf the fourth one is satisfied about
my blindness, may we talk business?
Shall we talk
at the training center?
Come, please
Ms Neha, either you are unaware
or you are pretending
What do you mean?
- My sixth sense never fails me
l know
Aight now, amongst us
there is a fifth person
''The game is exciting''
''Death is an enticing prospect''
''Every moment is exciting''
This is where...
- Tell me about the job
You got to...
- Sing...?
l'm paying you 5 million
to rob a bank for me
Did you hear me?
- But how is that possible?
Why miss the forest
for the trees?
Done. How about an advance?
A hundred thousand or two...?
Arjun, try to understand.
- First, see a shrink
Arjun, stop. Try to understand
But l said yes! Why are you
shooting me? Are you mad?
Arjun! Listen! You got to do it.
The next shot will be aimed
Go to him! Talk to him Vishwas!
He has no options
Why did you shoot?
- lf he walks out, our game is over
You promised there wouldn't
be any bloodshed
And because you want to see your
brother alive, you promised...
that you'd make this plan succeed
So go and talk him into it
Else, he's dead
and your brother too. l promise
Arjun, it's 5 million or death.
- l won't commit a crime for money
Do it for a cause.
Give me your share
And how do you get out of here?
On shoulders, like a corpse.
She won't let him walk out alive
l can try, can't l?
Stop
Next step, you were over the cliff
Arjun stop! Or l'll shoot
- Out of no-gun?
lf you wanted me dead,
you'd let me fall off the cliff
Arjun, listen! l'm begging!
lf you ditch me, l'm in a mess
lt's an innocent life...
- lnsanity! Am l to rob a bank?
To keep you out of trouble?
- All l can tell you is...
if you're determined to walk out,
an innocent life will be lost
lf not for your own sake, do it for
the sake of someone else. Stay back
Before you is a near-identical
model of the bank's headquarters
lt's close to the original
l'll familiarize you
with a walkthrough
How is that possible?
- This guy will bring us bad luck
When they get to know we're blind...
- lf they get to know
Not like a blind man.
You're going in like any other man
During the robbery, no one except you
will know you're blind
Why don't you use men who can see?
- Ominous, again. Neha, kill him
Arjun is right
Why did you choose us?
Because sighted men do not possess
your faculties. Your blindness
After the robbery, by chance
if anyone suspects you...
all you got to prove
is you're blind
Who'd believe 3 blind men robbed
a bank in broad daylight. Trust me
Your weakness
is your greatest strength
Now. First the geography. Layout,
dimensions, angles. What's where
Get the feel, get the touch,
etch it in your minds
Who fell?
- My teeth fell out
Sightless, mindless, moron! Looking
for your lost marbles on the floor?
No, checking out the floor
lnside the bank, will you crawl?
- l said sorry, didn't l?
After l've kissed your wife
would you take a sorry from me?
l'd strangle you and say very sorry
Strangle me?
- With one hand
l see! Just one hand...?
- Want me to show you how?
Who wants to kiss your wife?
l only want to kiss my girl
Just let me make my 5 million.
Then l'm marrying her
Neha, forget this blind bat.
Give me the training
Try marching with your feet tied
every morning
She ought to sew your mouth too.
Come on, practice
Been at it for4 days!
Even without the ropes my legs
won't come unstuck
l sleep with my legs akimbo. Useless
- Unless we fall in step...
how can the plan work? Where might
you end up after 3 steps?
lnside the bank, we use our legs
for eyes. So we got to fall in step
That's why Neha insists on
the ropes
Hear that?
Neha... Neha...
Vishwas, what's the time?
- 302 minutes past 45 hours
What have you got to do? Walk.
- The poor thing is in trouble
Friend of mine is in trouble too,
shits pitfalls
Will you rob a bank for him?
But the sob story comes from Neha!
Arjun please, rob a bank!
Off he goes
Arjun stop! Pitfall ahead
Arjun!
- What happened?
What happened, Vishwas?
- Arjun, are you all right?
lnside a pit? Vishwas! Bury him!
- Shut up
Give me a hand.
- Not to someone in the pits
Take my hand.
llyas, hold my hand
Take me back.
Come on, up
He's out? Throw him back inside.
- With you, come on
l hope you aren't hurt Arjun?
- Neha...? No, l'm fine
Find me a doctor.
- What for?
l want to break his bones
Neha look! He's trying to strip me!
Blind man's rape! Help
l forgot to tell you about...
- The graves you dug. Three, for us
The main entrance is behind you
Three strides ahead
Four steps leading down
Aight.
- Turned
Three steps ahead
Here's the enquiry counter.
Take a left past it
Five steps
Seven strides to the pillar
Got a jungle in there too?
llyas, seven steps ahead.
To the counter
Take a right.
- Puppet turns
Sofa at four strides
Aeverse.
- Aeverse...?
This way.
- Say about turn
Here, about turn. Now?
- Four strides to counters
This way. Seven strides
What's this?
- Savings counter
Five strides ahead,
one step up
The receipts counter.
- Aeceipts?
Here's where you get paid.
- ln Allah's name, give
Aeverse
About turn.
- That's toeing my line. Clever
One step down.
- Here l come
Eight strides ahead
l'm at eight
l'm waiting
One step up
Three strides ahead
Turn left
Twelve steps up
You got it?
One minute...
Etched that sketch.
Here's a replay
What's ahead? Door. What's behind
the door? Something sinister?
Concentrate on
the sound of marbles
Went awry?
- Yes. You got to work on it
Here, work hard on her
What happened?
- Never used a gun before
No Arjun
What's the matter?
- l never used a gun before
Damn
Okay listen
First, place your hand on mine.
Like this
Hand-in-hand...?
- The other arm goes here
What's going on?
- Hold tight
Tight...? What's this?
Some sexy movie?
Shut up!
She's showing me how to shoot
He minds?
Vishwas, the wheel is 12 strides away.
Aoll it down
Listen for the sound
Got it? l got it?
- Everything except the bottle
Who named you Arjun
after the legendary archer?
Vishwas, now that l've found myself
pallbearers, l can die in peace
Man is such a wretch,
afraid of death
They die every day, all their lives
they're working towards death
And yet they're scared of death.
What do you say to that?
He's dying for Neha, dying to
get on with life. And you...
you're dying for the life you lost.
- What do you getting at?
As if you don't get me? Melodrama
l know, every evening you mourn her
Photo-in-hand
There you put it away, didn't you?
Hey, my sixth sense works a bit too
Whose photo?
Tell me. Come on,
if you're a friend
Look, it'd be nice to know
you're sad
Like having company in misery.
l'm not the only one who's finished
Aaina. That was her name
My fiancée. Was.
- Was meaning what?
She married someone else.
You went blind,
she kicked your butt?
No, l'm not sad because she left me
Just because l'm blind, l don't
expect her to wear a blindfold
But she could've come to see me,
at least for once, even as a friend
l would've refused her.
Only thing that makes me sad is...
she never gave me a chance
to tell her how much l loved her
Curse lady luck
Here's one jilted lover.
Another one is asking for it
He'll shoot the Moon out of the sky,
but he'll never hit the bottle
This is a dangerous game.
lf you miss, you're going to hit me
So, careful
llyas, step forward
llyas is holding the plate.
- May l pass the gun to Arjun?
What...?
What do you mean?
- Arjun shoot the plate
Are you insane?
You're giving a gun to a monkey
Arjun, bless your mother.
Don't shoot me. Put the gun down
By my mother,
l'm not gunning for the plate
llyas keeps asking you who named you
after the legendary archer. Tell him
You're true to your name. Shoot
Get him on the butt
He's a rotten shot! You know that.
He can't even brush his teeth
Arjun! lf l get shot,
l'm going to thrash you
Come on, give up your ghost
l'm out of here
Take that and that...
- For Neha's sake Arjun...
lf Arjun is the train Neha is
the chain. l'll keep tugging
Stand here
Careful
What happened?
Act two
He's bleeding in the eye
Are you hurting?
- What's wrong?
lbrahim used an overdose of
the chemical in my eyes to blind me
Happens every three or four days
l told the bastard
l'm blind already
lt was a wounded eye,
not food cooking
But he kept rubbing it like spice
into my eyes
Let's take him in
Vishwas, after the first hurdle
you must defuse the burglar alarm
lf activated, the alarm will alert
every police station in the vicinity
ln five minutes the police will be
inside the bank
20 seconds after the alarm
is defused...
the vault door shuts automatically
Come what may Vishwas, you must
stop the door from locking
Else, the jewelry container
will be locked in
Did he fall?
He'll make it the next time
He'll fall again.
- You bet?
l'm not so blind as to bet blindly
on a blind man. Silly
Get the ball
Don't hit me with the ball
Where's the goal?
- Who named you after the archer
l'll tell you
Neha, why is your boyfriend
after me?
Shut up llyas,
don't let him hear you
You talk too much.
l said, shut up
He'll talk till he drops dead
How about flying to see your girl?
Throw the ball at me
Arjun, hold him.
l'll get the ball
Take back my wealth...
snatch from me my youth...
but give me back...
the rains in my childhood days...
the paper boats, the pouring rain
Wonderful llyas! You sing very well
Been singing ever since l was a kid
That day l even sang happy birthday
to myself
Mummy went out to buy
a birthday cake
Was my fifth birthday
l couldn't wait for Mummy to
get home. So l went out after her
After a while, l realized l was lost
There l stood and l cried,
waiting for Mummy to come...
pick me and take me home
lbrahim came by
Took me to the slums,
far away from Mummy
Mummy told me...
whenever you're afraid, whenever
you're in trouble, call Allah
l set my sights on the nearest
shrine and l drifted off to sleep
When l came awake, the sleep
wouldn't leave my eyes
He blinded me in my sleep
The dream of a heaven
cast me in hell
This is my Mummy's handkerchief.
lt still smells of her
Of my childhood
When l'm dead,
use this for my shroud
l'll feel as if l'm asleep
in my mother's lap
Hey llyas,
let's talk something else
Do you got to hear he movies? l do
l got to. To find out which
songs they whistle to
ln trains l got to sing those songs
And you Vishwas?
- Why should he? His sixth sense...
must be laying out the full story
for him, beforehand. Yes wizard?
Something new cooking
in your brains?
Two things. Neha isn't what
she makes herself out to be
Absolutely right. The poor thing...
Goodness! Poor thing?
And l'm a beggar caught between
a Aomeo and a wizard
But she is a poor thing?
- Shut up
Hey, are you going to marry her?
Want to father her babies?
Make sure you feed the babies
through their mouths, not their ears
We just got to stick together,
like this. As friends
During and after the robbery,
we got to stay close
lf blindness is our weakness,
unity is our shield, our might
We should never desert each other.
- One is the other's walking stick
That's what we're to each other.
- And as a threesome, we'll succeed
We shall overcome...
we shall overcome some day
Arjun and llyas
and Vishwas...
we shall overcome some day

Stop singing out of tune
These mannequins can give you only
a feel. When you're in the bank...
guessing who is approaching you
and assessing why is left to you
Okay, so here's the bank and here
are the people inside. Start
Even inside the bank,
he's singing for alms
Your phone is ringing
Nice. Feels as if l'm walking on
an empty railway platform
Hey, someday l must bring
the gang over to bank
lt'll be fun
This plan is impossible
and l'm right
One small mistake and
the entire plan is dashed
Just like this
lf we can't manage with mannequins,
what will we do inside the bank?
Ms Neha, try as much as you will
but three blind can't rob a bank
October 27th is an auspicious day
for moving into the new offices
For the last 30 years, l have
performed the holy ritual
lf l may be allowed to perform
the rituals for a last time...
Okay Aajput. You're doing
the ritual this time
But remember...
- That day...
Come the day...
it being the annual ritual...
l will not let anything go wrong
You have my word
A shopful of dreams!
ln one fell sweep...
l'm leaving tonight.
- Where?
Where! Do l own this mansion?
What are you asking?
Where do whores end up?
ln brothels
My brothel is the local train
Why are you crying?
We tried, didn't we?
So what?
We can go back to our lives.
l only feel bad for the poor thing
Off he goes again, after Neha!
Will someone talk sense into him?
No llyas. Just think,
what will happen to her?
You saw. l tried my best, sir!
Left nothing undone
For the last 30 years, l have
performed the holy ritual
Mr. Aajput, you saw.
llyas made one mistake
The mistake was mine
lf l may be allowed to perform
the rituals for a last time...
Mr. Aajput, won't you listen to me?
- Very well Mr. Vijay Singh
You're doing the ritual
this time too
You still don't get it?
On the day, l will be there
inside the head office
Do you know where you are?
No
This token machine isn't working.
Maybe
l'm in front of the water cooler
l'm at counter number 10
Which means you'll be there...
- l'll be performing a ritual
After supervising the robbery,
l'll leave
When it's done,
they will take me hostage
And l will lead them here
May l have a form for
a new account?
Aemarkable painting,
particularly that cap
Where did you buy it from?
- Sorry, l don't know
Orjust a minute,
we bought it from so-and-so place
lt's okay or all right
or thank you
l'm coming from Aaheja & Aaheja.
l want a form for a safe deposit box
Go to counter number one.
Mr. lngle, please give him a form
Excuse me, water...?
- The water cooler is in that corner

Besides, your man will be

Arjun, you need to wear that.
- Why?

The guard will say,

Only after the guard is bent over
Hands in the air! Everyone queues up
in front of counters nine and ten

Last day for us in the old office
We're all a little nervous
Naturally. This is where you

Beginning and end too.

What is the matter?
He stole my purse. Call the police.

He's a customer

Shall l call the police?

- Hey, none of my fault
l was told to ask about the painting.
What's this? Am l a thief because...
l asked about the painting?
- When l turned, you took my purse
lt was the one you gave me.
- The one l gave you?
By my harmonium, l didn't steal
the purse. Frisk me if you will
Frisk him! Now!

lf she says frisk him, frisk him
Hey stop
What do you take me for?
You'll find it tough if l frisk you
Now what is the matter?
- lf she says frisk him, frisk him
To satisfy you, l'll frisk him.

He won't listen, will he?
What are you doing here?
Get back to yourjob
Listen, let me frisk you...
- Today is Friday. l'm fasting
No one touches me
Trust me. lf l frisk you
nothing will be found on you
Are you sure? Then why are your
hands inside my pocket?
Look, there are only ten minutes
before the security van arrives
- We have very little time.
- No, l can't let you.
Please! Why don't you tell him?
Let me talk to him
Let him frisk you
No, you'll get me killed
Please, let him frisk you.
He's a nice guy

Hands up. Ouick
You're here?

You.
- Who me...?
Yes, by the count of ten,
get the jewelry container...
and place it on this handkerchief.
- Please count till twenty
- lt's heavy.
-Just do as he says
lf she says it's heavy, it's heavy.
- Then you go with her
What are you doing?
Don't try to get past
the enquiry counter
You think you're smart?
- l made a mistake
What were you trying to do?
- l wanted to check my car
Car! Want me to clean
your carburetor?
l'm my father's only son!
- And you got only one dad?
Only one father, only one mother.
- Are you clever? Open your mouth
That's your toothbrush
Have you brushed your teeth today?
What fell down?
- Gun
Pick it up
Pick
Put it in your mouth
ln your mouth
Done? Now stand still
Do you see? New toothbrush
Put it down!
On the handkerchief
The jewelry belongs to our
clients. Please, don't take it away
Number Three, take it away
You won't be able to sell it.
- Shut up
We'll wear it
Can we sit down and talk this over?
- We don't want to talk
Listen! You are committing a crime.
All the jewelry is marked
Listen to me,
where are you taking me?
Shut up!
- You can't get away
Ouick
Get out
Out
Fast
Open the door
Where is your car?
- Over there
Just drive, to Byculla. Ouietly.
- Who's this?
Shut up. l'll tell you later.
Drive
Are you blind? Do you push cars?
Shift the gear
This is no good.
Whom have you brought?
How about going back?
- No way, straight ahead
Vishwas, drive back.
- Arjun, you're out of your mind
The two of you are
out of your minds
You can't deceive Neha like this
Turn back.
- Okay
No way.
- Turn back
Straight ahead.
- Turn back
Just keep shut and keep driving.
- Sure
Don't deceive Neha like this.
- l'm not deceiving Neha
We aren't getting away
with the loot
We're going to the training center
Why did you have to do this?
Neha assured us
l trust Neha. l don't trust the man
who was with her
l did this for our security.
That's why l changed the plan
You never found it necessary
to tell me?
Nice friends.
- Arjun try to understand
What do we do with him?
- He's harmless. We'll let him go
Straight to heaven.
- Don't kill me
- l'm a godfearing man
- That's why l'm sending you to God
Name?
Dilnaz.
- l'm her friend
Give me the gun.
And the box
Get out
Hail a cab, quietly.
- How can l do it quietly?
Then sing for a cab.
- Shut up llyas
You stay put. People will faint
at that voice coming from a burqa
Hail a cab.
- How...?
Say something.
- What do l say?
To hail a cab, you don't scream
helicopter-helicopter, do you
Say taxi-taxi
You'll end up hailing a matchbox
with that squeak. Scream
Taxi, Daddy.
- He drives a cab?
Where to?
- l want to go home
l mean, Shamim Street.
- No Borivli
You said we're going to the
training center. What's going on?
We change cabs to evade the police.
Let's go
You know Pandurang Naka in Borivli?
You don't know? Take us there
What do you mean?
- Drive, l'll show you
You mean the three men...
Two men and a woman in a burqa.
The man who asked for a new account
He had a strange name.
What was it?
They used number, not names
lf she said he had a name...
- A name beginning with E
What was his name?
For the sake our love, Delnaz!
- Yes, ldiot
Keep the change
Neha here. Where are you?
- ln the bank
The whole town knows
about the robbery
See me at the parking lot
at Fountain
Looks like he's coming around.
- And l'm going to faint with joy
Looting a bank was such fun! How
about another bank? ln partnership
Partnership? With you? Never
You were supposed to ask if the bag
was imported. And what did you ask?
ls this gun for real?
Thank your stars that
no one found out we're blind
Come on llyas.
Neha will be here soon
Where's the container?
- Here you are
Hide it somewhere safe.
- l know this great place
Once l've hidden it there,
even l ever know
Don't trust him.
- Of course l'll remember, you fool
Stop quarrelling. Go!
Neha will be here soon
And listen, don't get drunk
Maybe they made a mistake.
l was the one who told them...
You...!
- ln case something went wrong
l told them to go to the training
center. They might be there
lf they did this on purpose...
- No, no Mr. Aajput
Alms for the blind
l will pray for you
Blind man? Who will pray for me?
- Yes
Vishwas, what do we do with him?
- Let's see
He isn't here!
- What...?
Don't move!
You know l'm a crack shot
Where is he?
- Shut up Arjun
Let me listen to his footsteps
What have you done?
- l didn't do anything
Who else? You killed him!
- l didn't shoot
The who shot him?
- l did
Neha, you...?
You killed him?
Just go and bury him in a pit.
- You killed this poor guy?
Do as l say. Else...
- What will you do?
Arjun! Don't argue!
- But Vishwas...
Time...
bide for our time
Come on Arjun
What happened to your sixth sense?
lt didn't tell you he'll get killed?
Get a hold on yourself, Arjun.
- How? l'm putting someone...
in his grave. And you tell me
to get a hold on myself?
l can understand. But Neha
could never have done this
And you know it.
- l know it, but...
You promised me Mr. Aajput,
there wouldn't be any bloodshed
lf you do not give unto me what is
mine, l shall kill you, in turns
l won't renege on this promise
l don't understand anything, Vishwas.
- You'll get to know everything
Just let me confront him
You'll come to know everything.
Let's bury him
Arjun! Please tell me where llyas is.
- Else? You'll kill him too?
l didn't
Yes, l killed him!
And you're responsible for it
You deceived me! You took
someone else hostage at the bank
We have deceived no one
lnstead of coming here,
we could've escaped
Get this clear Neha. Until we're
assured that we aren't threatened
The police and you including,
we hold the container
Yes, we have sent llyas away.
To hide the loot
Where have you sent llyas?
Where is llyas?
You're my fire
Come to me, my love
''The swill... ''

''Take me to your lips
before the spill''
''Enjoy the drink
before you get drunk''
''Drink secretly if you wish''
''But drink in amour of me''

Next MAC 7625.
Mahim to Shamim Street? Aight?
Get the cab drivers.
lmmediately
Yes what?
- This wallet was found
Come with me
Near Pandurang Naka in Borivli.
They behaved strangely
One of them bumped into me.
His nose...
One minute...
- Yes?
Check this wallet carefully.
- Yes sir
What about his nose?
- He was wearing a disguise
l took a look at him, up close.
- So you saw him for real?
''Opened the bank locker''
''One was a rustic''
''One was a bastard''
''One was a singer''
Can you describe him?
Yes sir
''Bottles, waste.
Fix a lock. Aob a bank''
How long for the sketch?
- Nearly done
lf your man identifies him,
my work is over. Your work begins
l'm just a small drink
He's the one!
The man who bumped into me
He's the man
lf l'm correct, he must be
somewhere in Shamim Street
Put up this poster on every wall
in Shamim Street
We'll comb every house on
Shamim Street
l want him in 24 hours
Move it
Every shop, every nook and cranny.
Look everywhere
Must solve this case tonight
Stop it
Aren't you ashamed?
- l'm not thieving, am l?
Just relieving myself
lt's past 12:30 am. Where is llyas?
- He escaped
He's going to sell the jewelry
to buy himself a train
To have the train all to himself,
to beg and he'll pay himself
Don't ever see us.
And her, never
No
Let him shoot
At least
it will bring him out
Step forward, coward
l'm right here.
ln front of you
The one at the bank...?
- Yes
Here
There
Everywhere. l am the maker
of this game
Now, where is llyas?
- He has been identified
The police is all over
Shamim Street
Posters of llyas
are everywhere
llyas is in danger.
l can see
They must be here
Everyone is lying!
- Someone is misleading you
Trust me.
- l don't trust you
Everyone is lying! You don't know?
Why such a big lie?
You don't know Aajput.
You don't know him
My Aahul
Who is this Aahul?
- My little brother
He is holding him hostage. Even
if l have a gun l can't kill him
What might he be going through?
Neha listen, listen to me
l became part of the plan
to save somebody
Who he was, l didn't know
But l know you.
And l love you
Trust me, nothing will happen
to Aahul. We're getting out alive
You spirited him away
But l'm not going
to let you succeed
Where have you been?
Where is the container? Tell me.
- Are you scared?
Say nothing! Keep shut
Where have you hidden the container?
- She has a hoarse voice now?
He's bleeding in the eye again
Again! Not again...
High fever and the bleeding won't stop.
We ought to do something
He'll die! Unless
he gets medical attention
No! Where's my booty?
- l'll tell you
But on one condition.
Get him medical help
l want my booty first!
- We'll give it to you
But right now,
llyas is in danger
Get me a doctor
DrSiddiqi. Shamim Street
Don't argue with me.
Make sure you get an ambulance
A getaway will be easier
in an ambulance
Have you searched the house
on the hill?
No sir
- Leave the witnesses here
The rest, come with me
Vishwas has a strong sixth sense.
llyas is in danger
The police has identified him.
He must die
What are you saying?
- You laugh at everything, don't you?
You promised me, Mr. Aajput...
- Where is the box? Tell me
Leave him, spare him.
- llyas, tell me where it is
You'll die laughing.
- Let go of him
llyas is in danger
Tell me.
- No
Tell me where you kept it
and l'll let you go
You've killed him!
- No, l didn't kill him
You killed him!
- Accident! You saw that
Don't be insane
Neha, don't go mad
l'm going to kill you!
- Your brother...
is still with me.
The police will be here soon
And l'll tell them the truth
lf the police arrive here,
you are finished
You're finished, Neha
You were the one who trained
the blind men
l advertised in the papers
using your name
And the woman who was part of
the squad that hit the bank, you are
That's what l'm going to depose
if the police questions me
You are in a fix.
Also the two guys
You can't kill me
You're my shield
As long as you are alive,
nothing can happen to me
What if l'm no longer with you?
- Meaning what?
l'm your shield.
As long as l'm alive...
Arjun and Vishwas
can't get out of the fix
Look Neha...
l might not be able to save Aahul...
but l'm going to save
the two of them
Look Neha... listen to me.
- You were right Aajput
Who'd believe that three blind men
robbed a bank in broad daylight?
For Vishwas and Arjun, the strongest
defense is their handicap
And my death
The police might be here
any moment
l... l didn't kill her
What are you doing?
The police are coming
They might be here any moment
''l have a gun, but l can't kill him.
Only he knows where Aahul is''
Vishwas, you can only hear.
l can also see
What little time we have,
we are losing. Listen to me
lnstead of five l'll pay
each of you 10 million
Just let me have the container.
- You won't ever find it Mr. Aajput
Only llyas knew where it is.
- No! No Arjun!
lf you really don't know
where the container is...
Farewell
Want to play hide and seek?
So no lights
Vishwas! lt's me, Arjun
Come on, quick
Arjun, are you all right?
- Yes, how are you doing?
Okay
Arjun, there's a window ahead
Open up
Open the door
How good of you to come here!
- Mr. Aajput, what are you doing here?
l... come inside
The robbers have been nabbed.
The constable told me
That face... l noticed something
peculiar at the bank
l told you l'd find the man
who robbed my bank
Here's the man you identified
Call an ambulance, quick
And who's this woman?
Who killed her?
What's going on here, Mr. Aajput?
She planned the robbery.
- What nonsense...
Can you explain how she was murdered?
- She had three accomplices
They robbed the bank. One, this llyas.
The two others, they killed him
Aight now, they're locked
inside that room
Where are you going?
They're dangerous
We ought to surrender.
And it's best to tell the truth
ln her death, Neha wanted to tell us
something. Think Vishwas
Yes, she wanted us to come out
with the truth
Open the door.
Come out
Surrender to the police
Something peculiar, something strange
happened when he stole my purse
They...?
Mr. Aajput, the two of them?
- Yes they are the ones
l heard you're just a little crazy.
Not this wild
What do you mean to say?
- You mean to say that they...
these blind men robbed the bank?
- Yes
What...? We robbed a bank?
Luckless as we are, robbed of even
a moment's joy, how can we rob a bank?
Sir, please save us.
He is a madman
He keeps threatening us,
he'll kill us
Fate hasn't been kind to us.
- And he said something about...
implicating ourselves in some robbery.
Else, he said he'd shoot us
Mr. Aajput, what they are saying...
- l can hear. l hear them...
the poor helpless scoundrels.
Now you listen to me
The three of them... don't laugh
l'm going to prove this
Please go on.
- This one, llyas
He was involved in the robbery,
you accept that, don't you?
Without doubt.
- But he was blind
Was he? But from the sight of him,
the eyes were gouged out, recently
Gouged out, to prove that
blind men can rob a bank
llyas could see perfectly well
What?
- What else?
llyas was blind.
Arjun was the one in a burqa
ln a burqa? l'm not a pervert.
- You didn't wear the burqa?
The teacher wore the burqa.
Neha, who is no more
Another lie! llyas wasn't blind,
Neha wore a burqa. And the third?
lbrahim. He vanished with the loot.
- Who's this lbrahim?
l don't know any lbrahim.
lt was the three of them
Vishwas, llyas, Arjun.
- Neha, llyas, lbrahim
lbrahim! He's llyas'boss!
You hear him?. Moments ago he said...
l don't know any lbrahim. And now?
- What l meant to say was...
Decide Mr. Aajput. Did you know him?
Did you not know him?
Look...
please come with me
ln a warehouse in the rear...
you'll find a perfect model
of the bank headquarters
See for yourself. You will know
the wheat from the chaff. Come
Get Delnaz, her boyfriend
and the taxi driver
You wanted to frisk him.
- And he refused
Afterwards... he was frisked...
- Come on, the boss wants you
Come in. Look
The logs are rotten.
Burn them right now
Mr. Aajput, l'm waiting for
the wheat and the chaff
The model was right here. l saw it.
- Aeally?
Where is the model?
- What modeling are you talking of?
There was no modeling here.
- lt's only the workshop
Here we were taught how to
weave baskets, make flower vases
Clay toys...
- Horses, elephants, monkeys
Yes, also classical dance.
Shall we show you a dance?
Bless us Lord
The poor things are blind.
- They aren't blind
They're frauds!
Pretending to be innocent
During the robbery,
you saw them, didn't you?
Take a good look.
Aecognize them?
Tell him.
- One minute Mr. Aajput
Take a good look at them.
Could they be bank robbers?
This one might be
And you?
- lf she says might be, it maybe
What if l tell you they're blind?
- Blind...?
ln that case, impossible
What do you think?
- What did Delnaz say, sir?
Did you suspect that the passengers
in your cab were blind?
Who said?
- l said
Are you raving? Are you blind?
On the way from Byculla to Borivli...
they showed me the shortcuts.
They knew all the roads
Blind? No way, not even partially
You may leave
Don't fall for what these fools say.
- Am l to fall for you instead?
The one in a burqa.
- Eyewitnesses said, it was a woman
How? Did they unveil the woman?
- Did you?
l'm the one who sent them
l remember! When he frisked that man,
he found nothing. The next moment...
out came a gun. This man
was in league with them
Where is the jewelry, Mr. Aajput?
Will you tell me here
or at the police station?
Listen to me, give it a good thought
Hear me out
Let me tell you
You are coming with me.
- Listen to me...
l know...
- No you don't know
The three of them can rob a bank.
- l can understand
You can't! Three blind men can walk
into a bank and they can rob it
Let's talk in the police station.
- l'm coming, but give it a thought
Three blind men can walk
into a bank and they can rob it
Neha didn't die in vain.
Aahul has been rescued
And no one believed him
Neha is gone, llyas is gone
and with them...
For the first time in my life
my sixth sense failed me
Lost the money, lost good friends
too. Let's go away
l don't like it here anymore.
- Yes, pick up llyas'harmonium
He told me to take care of his
harmonium in the eventuality
One minute...
- What happened?
My sixth sense hasn't failed me.
- What do you mean?
llyas! We won
l hope Aahul adjusts to
Bit difficult for him perhaps, but...
Arjun, he's somewhere near.
- Who?
Mr. Aajput.
- What are you saying?
He's in jail.
- No he's here
What kind of a joke is this?
You threw me out of the bank,
l threw you out of the bank
Why did you do that?
You had your own bank robbed?
They have all the evidence
This man is a lunatic!
He planned a clever heist
Decide! You call me a lunatic
and a clever planner?
