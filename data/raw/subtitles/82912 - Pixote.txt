This is a district of São Paulo...
a great industrial center
in Latin America...
responsible for 70% of the gross
domestic product of the country.
Brazil's population reaches
120 million people...
and around 50% of them are under
21 years old.
Of those, approximately 28 million
children...
live in conditions different
from those...
regulated by the Children's
International Rights.
Also, there are some
3 million children...
who are homeless...
who don't have a family
structure.
Their situation is even more
chaotic...
as they can only be arrested for
any crime after they're 18...
allowing adults to attract these
children...
so that they can commit
any kind of crime...
and not be punished.
They will be sent for a couple
of months to a reform school...
and will be released, due mainly
to lack of vacancies.
In this neighborhood...
live the families of workers
of large industries.
The parents go to work, leaving
their children at home...
and usually the older daughter
cares take of the others...
or some neighbor gets paid
to do that.
Fernando, who plays the role
of Pixote in this film...
lives here with his mother and
9 brothers.
The children acting in the film
belong to this social category.

Ok, love, Ok...
It's crazy in here!
Want me to give up the job?
Please, I've been waiting an hour.
Just a minute a longer, please.
I'll give you a call later on,
all right? Bye.
My son's been missing for over
a month.
That's another thing.
Just give us his name for now.
-José Maria...?
-José Maria da Silva.
Get going, all of you.
Go on, move!
What's up?
They're picking everybody up.
They killed some old guy
and are pinning it on us.
Pedro Sócrates. Father: Julio.
Mother, Ambrosia, 15 years old.
Diego Emanuel, 13. Marcolino dos
Anjos, father unknown, right?
João Henrique, 10. Maria da Costa,
father unknown, right?
-My father's dead!
-Father unknown, right?
Anastacio Pereira. Father: Roberval.
Mother: Severina.
17 years old, right?
José Altacilho. Father: Fortunato.
Mother: Julia. 16 years old, right?
Edmundo Pires, alias Marilyn.
Parents: Luis, Esmeralda. 17?
Raimundo de Souza.
Father: Pedro.
What a mess!
Everyone up!
Line up!
Back again, eh?
You know the routine.
You don't get hit for nothing here.
Let's have a bit of order!
In here you're a man.
Any trouble and you'll answer to me.
Any questions?
No questions.
Sunday's visiting day.
No whores. Just family.
Get them to the dormitory.
Come on, quick!
Keep quiet!
We fancy your ass.
Shut up!
It'll be ok if you keep quiet.
I won't ask who's responsible.
No one will come forward.
But hear this,
I'm not your father.
I don't put up with
any fucking around.
You want to kill each other,
do it outside. Not here...
Or I take the rap.
This is a respectable house.
You tell me everything or...
I'll smash your heads in!
-You saw who did it?
-Not me. I was asleep.
Fucking hell!
Get him to sick-bay.
You're gonna look great.
Watch out for Lilica.
Stop that. You get ants
in your pants?
Frightened you?
Wanna a drag?
Breathe in and hold it.
Right on!
This is the smoke that satisfies.
Go on, again.
That's it...
Shit, man, I'm so hungry.
I'm spaced out!
It don't get to old hands like
me so easily.
Let's split.
Pixote!
Fucking sexy chick!
Chick, my ass! She's a fag.
Lilica... but I'd fuck her.
How's your memory?
That guy's Almir.
A motherfucking cop!
You pushed an old guy
under a car the other day.
He's dead!
You did it just to get his wallet!
The guy was some judge.
You know what that means?
We sure fucked it up!
How could we know he was
important?
The Comissioner's get the screws
one me.
The Chief Comissioner's put
the screws on the Comissioner.
How does that grab you?
I want to know who did it.
Nothing will happen to you.
Here, the law protects minors.
You're untouchable.
But I'm not taken in by this
business of minors.
If you won't collaborate...
I'll just pick on one of you
and then where will you be?
The old man died on the corner
of Ipiranga and 24th of May.
Who hangs out there?
The guy doesn't know anything.
He died on the block,
not on the corner...
like this jerk said.
Go on then, you faggot!
Speak up, you whore!
Hey, bro,
keep your mouth shut, ok?
Mind your business.
One good turn deserves another.
When we get out of here there'll
be no stopping us. Ok?
-You've got it.
-Alright.
Start scrubbing, you pigs.
Let's get this dirt off you.
Disgusting!
Get rid of the lice.
And you, darling!
Get your ass nice and clean.
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing!
You like it?
You want to touch it?
Sit down, then.
Are you new here?
Boy, I was coughing all night!
Drink up, before it gets cold.
You'd better drink it.
You'll have to drink
it tomorrow, anyway.
You're gonna be nice and
strong when you grow up.
Earth...
is... round...
like... an...
orange.
Have you written that?
Pixote, why aren't you writing?
Go on!
Open your book.
Too tired to do it?
Well, you got to learn to write,
got to know things.
Come on, write it down.
Stop wasting time.
Start writing.
A... write it...
Fess up!
-I know nothing.
-Come clean, you son of a bitch!
How can I tell you what
I don't know, shit!
No swearing allowed here,
asshole!
You'd better talk.
I can wait all day.
I'm in no hurry.
You'll tell us in the end anyway.
So, talk!
Ok, Ok... I'll talk.
It's like this...
I met two guys on the street.
They asked me for a cigarette,
and I gave him one.
-Grass, right?
-No, just a plain cigarette.
Then they asked me if I was ever
involved in a stick-up.
Said I was...
they asked me go along...
They gave me a gun
and we went to a bank.
There were two guys there...
taking money out.
-May I help you?
-I'd like a loan.
-How much do you want?
-800.
How are you going
to pay for it?
With my savings account.
It's for my engagement.
Thank you.
Congratulations!
Hand over the money!
-We need it.
-There isn't much. It's too early.
What do you care? It ain't yours.
Hand it over or die!
-Quick, before someone comes.
-Please don't kill me!
I'll blow you away, motherfucker!
Quick, or I'll blow
your brains out!
The cops, Dito!
Shit, I'm not playing anymore!
Why not?
Pixote screwed it all up.
He burted out my name.
Kiss off!
I've got something
more interesting for you.
Naked women!
Imagine taking down her pantie:
and putting it in her.
Pixote's blushing.
-Enough, that's not for kids!
-Aw, shit, Lilica!
It's getting hard, you see?
There it is, you jerks.
That's all you think of.
You act like big men but you
got dicks this size.
You're still too close
to the nipple...
but you can me a favor.
Stop it, only Big boy can do that.
I don't mean that, silly.
It's something else.
On Sunday your relatives could
bring me some...
-Grass?
-What else? Soap?
-Don't want much, do you?
-I don't want any trouble.
It's easy for you, isn't it, Pixote?
Beats me!
I know someone who
could bring it.
But what's in it for me?
No one will rape you.
Nor beat you up.
We'll make sure of that.
What more could you want?
Ok.
There's just one more thing...
-I want cash.
-Bag off, fairy!
Let's play soccer.
Think about it, eh?
Lilica, I just told you I don't
want no trouble.
If you want a copy of today's
message...
ask for number 1720...
and for the theme: Jesus,
the king who bestows happiness.
Go and talk to the judge, mom.
I will, son, but I'm sure he
won't let you out.
And what for? So you can go
back on the streets again?
If anything happens to me in this
hell hole, it'll be your fault.
What could happen?
Pixote, if your Granpa turns up,
will you talk to him?
-I sure hope he doesn't!
-Why?
He pisses me off.
Come here, Roberto.
Fancy outfit!
Nervous?
Today's my big day.
See Fumaça's mother?
Never misses a visit.
You'd think she likes it here...
That's right. Ugly old bat!
Looks like she brought him
something.
Maybe it's cuscuz.
That last one was great.
Your mother wants to see you.
-Come on.
-I don't feel like.
-She's come all this way...
-I didn't ask her to.
Come on.
Sapato told me to get you.
Tell that cow I won't see her.
You won't talk to your mother?
She makes sacrifices and that's
the thanks she gets?
-Can I go?
-Yeah, go on.
When did he arrive?
About two months ago, I guess.
They caught him purse-snatching...
almost killed him.
Why didn't you ever
come visit?
-You don't turn me on anymore.
-Really?
He's good.
He really sounds like
Roberto Carlos.
When he gets out he'll he a star.
And what about you?
Look, I'm in a jam.
-So what?
-Can't you help me?
-What sort of jam?
-I need a few joints.
What do you mean by "joints"?
Just a few...
I won't get you anything.
Don't make trouble.
You watch out for yourself, boy!
Why can't you be like him?
I can't sing.
You'll have to get me
out of here!
Just hang on a bit longer, Pixote.
It's even worse out there.
Now, let's watch the singer.
Since you won't get me the stuff,
how about getting my mother?
If you find her before I do,
let me know.
-Keep still.
-Any other questions?
Why did you leave home?
Granny started naggin', so I left.
Look, I'm only trying to help you.
But you have to trust me.
Tell me everything.
If I do you'll turn me over
to the cops.
I'm not a cop.
I'm a doctor.
Promise you will tell the judge!
I told you I want you with
the others.
I forgot.
-What happened?
-He's moving.
I haven't assessed
his character yet.
Not my problem. Let's go.
I still haven't told her everything.
If she don't know, how will the
judge let me out?
Go, Pixote.
You can tell it to the other
lady there.
Everything you said is held
confidential.
Pixote, obey Mr. Sapato.
Almir, I don't want any trouble.
I want those kids back in 3 days.
Take is easy.
I always bring them back.
Sure, but some of
your colleagues haven't.
And I take the rap.
Don't panic.
If anyone asks...
they're on vacation.
Let's go.
I don't know.
Could be any one of them.
I only remember he was blond.
They all look the same.
How can I be sure?
You say he looked like
that blond one?
He's already committed
one homicide.
Could be, but I only saw him for
a second.
-I can't say for sure.
-It's him alright. He's wild.
That's what you say,
I can't be sure.
Let's go.
It won't bring father back.
I know it's painful,
but it's part of our job.
-What's your name, kid?
-Pixote.
Have you seen my son?
You know him?
Fumaça?
Yes. Do you know
where he is?
Is he sick?
Has something happened to him?
-We're winning.
-You, lady!
They took away a bunch of guys.
And Fumaça hasn't shown up yet.
You'd do better to
inquire further.
Better find yourself another son.
Cause that one's had it!
The bodies of 2 boys of about
15 have been found.
The victims were riddled with
bullet holes.
The authorities are
going around...
all the reform schools
in the city.
The only clue is the drill
uniforms they were wearing.
Let's go! Quick!
Get dressed and out!
We've got visitors.
Don't lie, or you're
back here.
This is the dormitory wing.
We work miracles with
our small budget.
That explains the conditions.
Are the children kept locked in?
It's not like that anymore.
This is our chief supervisor.
He's dedicated to his boys.
Excuse the mess.
It's difficult to keep clean
all day long.
And that boy?
-He's not studying?
-No, he's sick.
Infectious hepatitis.
Son, how are you getting
along here?
The doctor comes twice a week.
Did the mother see the boy in
the infirmary, or not?
She said she was here Sunday.
-They told the boy had run away.
-She's crazy.
I took her to the infirmary myself.
She was shocked, naturally.
Considering the state he was in.
She knew the police had
been here...
...and had taken the boy away.
-But the police never come here.
When boys fight,
they're worse than adults.
Could one boy attack
another with such violence?
Only if he was King Kong.
When he's better
you can talk to him.
We'd like the Press to spend
some time here.
To acknowledge the valuable work
we're doing.
Pixote! You're here!
Where's Fumaça?
They took us away somewhere
and worked him over.
-Why?
-They said he'd killed that old man.
His mother was here on Sunday,
she made a fuss.
She blew up when she found out
they'd taken Fumaça away.
She'd tell it to the papers.
It's gonna get rough.
So, tell us everything.
Almir, that son of a bitch...
drove off with some of the kids.
He made Carlinhos and Mirandinha
get out and finished them off.
-And then?
-He took us back.
And stuck us in solitary.
We were there for a long time.
Sapato came and got me out
and put me in fatigues.
-I gotta get out of here.
-Me too.
I saved a bit of glue for you.
-Where?
-Here. Go for it.
-Get rid of the can.
-Right. Thanks.
Let's split.
The kid doesn't look too good.
If doesn't eat, he'll "croak"...
Isn't that the way they say it?
He's dead, internal hemorrhage.
As I suspected.
How could something
like this happen?
He was turned over
to me all beaten up.
I did what I could.
Don't try to blame me!
You bastard! This will cost you
your job, I promise!
-Why did you turn the hid over?
-The cops came and took him.
Yell at them, not at me.
Why did you accept
the boy in that state?
I wasn't on duty.
He was here when I came...
-Who took him in then?
-What could I do?
Nothing!
Nothing!
Go fuck yourselves!
The press'll come down on us like
a ton of bricks!
God, that's all I need!
Any others like that?
What's that kid doing in here,
next to this one?
He's out of it.
He won't remember anything.
I'll not be blamed.
I'll put the blame on you.
Pixote, make your own bed.
Everybody's go to pull together.
Come on, get dressed.
The doctor says you can go.
Snap to it.
Where's Fumaça?
He was in that bed.
-Who?
-Fumaça.
That's nonsense, kid.
I don't know any Fumaça.
Drink this.
...drawn up by
President Figueiredo...
and on the bond of friendship
which unites...
Brazil and Uruguay.
Violence on the streets of
São Paulo increases daily.
At dawn, the body of
L.C.B. was found.
He had been missing for two weeks.
The Director of the Institute
explained to our reporters:
Fights are frequent between
the children...
mostly due to their social
background.
Concerning the boy who
was found dead...
I have been informed...
that he had been brutally
beaten up...
by one of his colleagues...
and that the attacker has been
identified.
His assailant, a minor,
has a police record...
of armed robbery,
assault and one homicide.
A typical juvenile delinquent.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I went and he wasn't there.
Then they told me had run away.
They told me he was
in the infirmary.
Then a boy told me that was a lie.
That the police had got him.
I don't know who's to blame.
I just want my son.
I think this institution's
pretty mysterious.
The boy's mother saw it.
And I did see the boy
in a terrible state.
He couldn't have taken a step.
How could he have run away?
It's enough.
Everyone get to bed.
Son of a bitch!
You want to set me up?
But it won't be like that.
You scum, you think
you can get rid of me.
But you're wrong, you hear?
That's quite enough for today!
Sapato, you son of a bitch,
I want to talk to you.
Everyone to the dormitory.
-Dinner is over!
-Everyone stay put!
Shit down, motherfucker!
Come on!
I'm gonna bust your guts.
I'll cut you in pieces.
Sapato, you swine,
get your ass here!
What's up?
What's the problem?
I didn't hurt Fumaça.
He was my friend.
It was you and your gang of friends.
You're stoned!
Stoned!? You want my skin!
Don't get carried away.
Even if you had done it,
nothing would happen to you.
You'll be 18 soon
and everything will be fine.
No one will bother you.
You don't even exist.
I didn't mention your name.
I wasn't even on duty yesterday.
Keep cool and
everything'll work out.
Now everybody get to bed.
Why the rush?
Let go!
You wanna whack me!
What's going on?
Who's there?
What have they done to you?
They got me, Lilica.
They finished me off.
They took me to the box.
They let me have it...
-Really worked me over.
-Tell me.
Are you hurt?
Where did they beat you?
Everywhere... Lilica.
They beat me with an ax handle.
-Help me, Lilica.
-I will.
I'll help you.
I promise no one'll lay
a hand on you again.
No one'll harm you.
-He's dying.
-No, he's not!
You're my man.
You're my life.
You're everything.
I promise I'll always stay by
your side.
He's dying!
He's not dying, you fuck!
You're not dying.
You're gonna stay with me.
I love you. I do.
You'll pay for this,
you fucking swines!
I'll kill all of you!
I may be the next one.
Let's split, Dito.
Open this door!
Let's break up this shit hole.
They want to kill me.
I may be the next!
Another one, Mario,
I am really worried.
What do you mean?
Was it really a kids' fight?
What was the dead kid up to?
He was a deviate. Liked fags.
If there's no suspect,
find one.
This'll blew the whole shit
wide open...
This is the second death
in less than two weeks.
You can ask Almir
about the first one.
You know...
why this country won't evolve?
Because it's full of idiots!
The judge has just arrived.
Well, let's get it over with.
Tonight a boy was killed.
Tell me everything you know.
As if you were telling it
to your father.
I am here to help you.
Why all the destruction?
Isn't this your home?
A home we all ought to care.
What's all this fighting about?
And killing each other?
You're here to reintegrate
into society...
as useful citizens.
You're missing the chance of
a lifetime.
Why?
Can anyone tell me?
Why?
Can you?
I'll only leave here until
I know the truth.
Only God can give or
take away life.
You may leave.
They're all blind,
deaf and dumb.
Terrible!
They're covering up.
Because they all feel guilty.
You're almost 18, aren't you?
Were you a friend
of the victim?
I knew him.
Tell me about him.
I know nothing.
I don't have anything to say.
Would you like to talk
in private?
What?
You can talk.
The judge will protect you.
-What are you saying?
-Why did you do that?
Did he betray you?
Were you jealous?
Go ahead. Tell us.
Liar! You're setting me up!
You started!
Had to do with queers, right?
He hit you and that's
how it happened, right?
You crook!
-You killed him, you fag!
-Enough!
Get out! Leave!
Get out!
You can tell me, son.
Don't be afraid.
My God!
That's the window!
Freedom's outside.
Let's go!
Go on... go on.
Come on. Let's go!
I'm staying.
It's worse out there for me.
Asshole.
Stop. Thief!
Help!
They took my purse!
That's my wallet!
I love lying here in the sun.
When I'm with you, I feel so calm.
And you?
What do you think?
Picture us in Copacabana.
Beautiful beach...
the sun shining...
Take us there, Dito.
I promise you, Lilica...
When we make the big time,
we'll go, all four of us.
Great.
I want to ask you something.
Do you like me?
Of course I do.
Then say it:
"Lilica, I love you."
-Cut it out, Lilica.
-Say it.
Don't screw around.
I certainly will!
Long time no see!
What a surprise! Pop in.
I thought you'd forgotten me!
How could I forget you?
Fine, wasn't it?
You took your time!
We've been here since 9.
Go on, Lilica.
The pipe of peace.
It's all yours, Dito.
No, I don't do grass.
Don't do grass?
Don't do grass?
You only took a small hit.
I don't care for non-smokers.
If you think you're just sitting
there looking on...
Get out! Get out!
-I just don't feel like it.
-Don't feel like it, my ass!
Pixote, show this asshole
what it's all about.
Suck in, man.
Your car's really great, Cristal.
Thanks, Pixote.
It is mine and my friends'.
But only for my close friends.
Piss off! Do you think
I'm your pussy?
-Leave the kid alone.
-What's on your mind, girlie?
What do you think this is?
-I'm sorry.
-My ass!
You ain't gonna watch anything.
You come here,
drink my booze...
mess all around,
watch this shit...
What do you think I am?
A whore?
You got it all wrong, Cristal.
Dito's just a kid.
He doesn't know about this sort
of thing. Give him a break.
A break, my ass! I'm wasting
my time with these idiots.
Wanna know something?
I won't make no deal.
So you can get out... now!
I said, beat it!
You can't do this. Dito worked
his butt off to get the dough.
That's not my problem.
It's yours!
Do us this favor, Cristal.
No, I won't...
Let me talk to him for a while.
You assholes.
There's some missing.
Where is it?
As soon as I sell the snort,
it'll be ok.
And where are you going
to deal it?
In Rio, I know the spots.
I'm gonna save you some time.
I don't do this for anyone,
but, I like you.
When you get to Rio,
go see my friend Debora.
A fine chick with
a big clientele.
Take it to her because Rio's
a pretty bad place.
If you can't find her, look for
Raulzinho at the Cowboy Club.
-You know the place, don't you?
-Yes, I do.
Get going then.
And don't forget.
You owe me five more grand.
It's a lot.
And no double-crossing.
If you mess things up,
it'll cost double. Double!
This is your break.
Either you deal...
or you'll get dealt.
Boy, I am hungry!
Just pretend you're eating
and you'll be ok.
Do you think we're
on the wrong train?
Never mind, man.
If we are, we'll get the right one.
We'll get there sooner or later.
When I get my share...
I'm gonna get me a board.
I'm gonna slide like this...
I'm not into that, Pixote.
I like seeing the bottom of things.
I spoke to the lady.
It's nearby.
Me and Lilica'll go.
You two stay here.
What's up? We came together!
-Why can't we go too?
-That's it.
I want to see the lady.
What if she's sexy?
Ok, let's go.
Come on, Pixote.
It's good. I'll take it.
-How did you get here?
-By train.
What are you staring at?
-You think I'm pretty?
-Yes.
Cristal still alive?
I thought he'd vanished.
Is this your first trip here?
Yeah, the first.
That'll be 13,000.
Did she say she lived here?
Where does she sleep?
-No telephone, no nothing.
-That right, kid.
This is just for business.
Why? You don't trust me?
No, it's not that.
Let's be friends.
I'll take you home.
I've got a son
about your age and size.
Wouldn't you like to
play with him?
This is for food and the
rest will come later.
No way!
What? Don't you trust me?
You've got my number.
It's plain like this...
I take the stuff to my friend,
he pays me, I pay you.
That's how it's always been.
Or do you think I walk around
with all that money?
-Alright.
-No, get the money.
-I said yes!
-You're gonna get screwed.
-She seems all right.
-Shut the fuck up!
Ok, you know best.
This is the way I work.
Either you want it or you don't.
I've got a lot of things to do.
How long would we have to wait?
I'll be back an soon as I can.
Leave half the stuff,
just in case.
If the man finds out you stole
his short, you're screwed.
-The water's great, Lilica.
-Don't splash.
You look like a pet.
Didn't they teach you any
manners at home?
What home? The brothel?
Watch your mouth.
My home was no brothel!
Will you two quit fighting!
Shouldn't Debora be back by now?
Maybe we'll better go back.
Dito'll be pissed off.
We just got here.
Why do we have to go now?
I want to know if Dito's got
the dough.
I saw some great threads today.
When I get my share no
motherfucker will mess with me.
I won't die like Big boy.
Stop bragging. No one knows
what's gonna happen.
When I get my share
of the take...
I'm gonna buy a nice new .38
and know what I'm gonna do?
This is a hold-up!
I said get up, you bastard.
That's how I'll treat those idiots.
Everyone'll respect me.
Chico, the King of the Trigger.
You know who'll be the first?
That cop who beat me up
at the station.
And I didn't even know why
he was hitting me.
But his day will come.
It sure will.
He'll pay for that.
Roberto should be here with us.
It would be great if he was here.
Only he couldn't go in the water.
His leg would rust and...
I'll be 18 next month.
Getting old, eh Lilica?
Then things will get rough.
I'll have to cool it.
If I'm caught I'll be beaten
and locked up forever.
When I'm 18, I'll split.
I'll see if Roberto'll let me
join his group.
For me, things will be the same.
They'll always be on my back.
They'll always find a way
to screw me.
"Right, you damn faggot".
What can a fag expect
out of life?
Nothing, Lilica.
I saw a boy running
I saw time
Playing around the life
Of that boy
I plunged my feet
In the stream
And I never took them off
The sun still shines on the road
And I never began
I saw the woman preparing
Another being
Time has stopped so I could
Stare to her belly
I knew she'd double-cross us.
Shit!
Fucking shit!
How did we ever get into this?
-You got us into this.
-Did I?
Did I give her the stuff?
Wake up, will you!
Yes, you. Aren't you the lady
of bastard Cristal?
What he's got to do with it?
Everything. All you wanted was
to fuck with him.
You took us there just
to show off.
Baby's jealous, isn't he?
I didn't do it to show off.
I did it for you.
Listen...
One thing I hate is people
cheating me.
Business is business,
it's yes or no!
That depends. Some business
requires a little cheating.
Some business is all cheating.
Kiss off, Lilica! I never want
to see your face again.
What's wrong with you?
Now it's done.
Just go!
Really want me to go, Dito?
Just say it once more...
and you won't see me again.
Go on, say it!
Say it... Say it again.
Pixote, Chico, come here.
It's ok. Raulzinho's waiting.
-You'll take it
-Not me I wouldn't feel safe.
Why not send Pixote and Chico?
If they catch them,
they can say...
they're begging.
I'll do it.
Here you go.
Ok. Let's go.
Don't hand over the stuff without
getting the cash. You hear?
No, I must go to São Paulo...
on business.
I'll be back in two days.
Who are you?
What do you want?
We called you up.
Cristal sent us.
Yes I know...
No, no, it's just that...
Come in...
No, I'll be back soon.
Hang on a minute.
Let me see, come on!
Put the shit over here.
No, it's a private matter.
I'll tell you later.
How much?
8,000 cash.
Ok. Hang on.
Why the hell did
you give it to him?
Didn't you hear
what Lilica said?
Shit, Pixote.
What could I do?
-He asked me!
-And you gave it to him!
Hi! Everything ok?
See who's there?
That cow Debora...
-Let's call Dito.
-No way.
We'll take care of this ourselves.
Come on.
What about the stuff?
We'll get it later.
Come on.
Mrs. Debora... are you ok?
What's up, boy?
We came to get our money.
We waited all day.
I was held up in the traffic.
Glad you come... I've got it.
You wait outside and after
the show I'll pay you.
No way.
We ain't gonna buy that.
We want it now, ok?
Piss off!
Leave or I'll call the police!
Then your bag goes with us.
It's my handbag!
Speak to me, Chico!
Please, say something!
You don't even know how to play!
Play with only one.
This is Dito, this is Pixote.
All real nice people.
Hey, take a look...
at that one over there.
-What do you think?
-Not bad at all!
She's a love machine, man.
1,000 a day, at least.
I'll hand her over to you
because I'm going away.
It is a bargain.
Let's get to the point.
Turn it off.
We gotta talk.
Close your eyes.
You think I'm stupid?
I was nice to you, wasn't I?
Sure, but you know
I've gotta go.
Only for a while.
They're ok.
Believe me.
And you said you'd agree.
What am I going to do
with these kids?
It's only for a while.
I'll be coming straight back.
Don't want to make trouble,
do you, Sueli?
Ok, Ok, forget it.
I just want to get some rest.
All set.
Hand over the cash.
-Look.
-Take it easy, brother!
This gun's great.
Brand new.
You only need some bullets.
Another 1,000 and it's yours.
You'll need it.
I already got one.
Like it?
-Do you want it?
-Of course I do.
I'll take it for Pixote.
What are you peeking at?
Are you hurt?
Are you sick?
Yes... I may be.
What are you staring at?
Should I have kept the baby?
What baby?
This one, damn!
What do you think that is?
A steak?
Didn't you mother tell you
how you were born?
Even looks like you.
Look at him.
Stop staring at me!
Get out or I'll stick you with
the same needle!
Out!
This god damned fever.
Won't it ever go away?
There was blood in the bathroom.
I think she's hurt.
No, she's just having her period.
Didn't they ever tell you?
It's women's sickness.
Quiet! I don't want any
trouble here.
Why are you so quiet?
Looks like a funeral.
I'm sorry but I'm not
myself today.
Anyone want some?
I'll just give it to Lilica.
You're of age now, right?
Now I can see you better.
If you know how to do it,
everything will be fine.
We'll split the money in half.
-In half!
-Shut up, will you!
-You've got a deal!
-This could put you in jail.
Don't worry... we're minors.
There won't be any trouble.
Yeah, right.
You're safety itself.
Right?
Spare me, kid. The macho number
doesn't add up with me.
The last one left me a souvenir
in the bathroom.
You saw it, didn't you?
What's your name again?
Pixote.
Pretty name.
Don't be angry with me, Pixote.
I'm feeling a bit edgy today.
They told me you're nice people.
Pixote could be the man for me.
How about it, Pixote?
We're here.
-Isn't it nice?
-What a hole!
-I didn't expect this.
-It's cheaper.
Anyway, for making love
it's the company that counts.
What are you waiting for?
I thought you couldn't wait.
Lean back. Let me help you
with your pants.
Shall I put some talc on it?
Give me the whole number.
-Are you in love?
-You're so juicy!
You too!
Never seen anything nicer
than you.
I'm crazy about you too.
Ok, you motherfucker...
-Hand over the money!
-Take the money.
Please don't kill me,
I have a family!
-See if this makes you come!
-Stinky oldie!
Take everything but
don't kill me.
-Hey, pal, give me a coke!
-Make it two, please!
What did you think of
our performance?
It was really great.
Give your meat if
you don't want it.
Go on! Take it all.
You're like pigs!
She pissed off?
Why?
-They're a couple, aren't they?
-Lilica likes cocks...
but Dito doesn't.
I know him.
I can assure you.
Now, I'll have a big chocolate
ice-cream. Just to top it off.
What about you?
Cognac and marshmallow.
Enjoying it? Goo, huh?
Well worth the money, eh?
-How much is a car like this?
-None of your business.
Pretty rich, aren't you?
I want one...
I want a car like this.
This car will be mine!
This car will be mine!
Easy now or I'll blow your
brains out!
-Quiet!
-Or I'll cut your balls off.
Nice and quiet.
Go on, get in there.
I think he shit in his pants.
And the money?
Better and better.
He beat me so hard
I ended up in the hospital.
I told him: "shove your money
up your ass".
I'll have a house and a car,
all my own.
Then I went to São Paulo.
On my own.
I worked in a nightclub.
It was really great!
I felt like a queen.
I would dance all night.
Pixote, change this song.
Hey, I was enjoying that!
Sueli told me to.
She's nice, huh?
"She's nice, huh?"
That's all I needed!
Like it?
Like it, Lilica?
What you did there?
I was a go-go girl.
I had a bikini like this.
All covered with glitter.
Smashing! Sort of heart-shaped.
I loved dancing.
I used to dance all night on
a stool. Like this.
Why did they throw you out?
That's a long story, Dito.
Come!
This car's much nicer
than Cristal's.
Do you think the guy back there
is hungry?
Just leave me alone, Pixote.
What's the matter with you today?
-You're being so difficult.
-Nothing's the matter.
I hate drunks!
Look, she's drunk.
So what?
Right?
-You're just being so stupid.
-I just don't like it.
-Give me some money and I'll go.
-You silly faggot!
Don't treat me like this.
I'm gonna split.
No one's leaving.
Come on!
Don't you like it here?
Something scared you?
Don't spoil the party.
Ever give anyone
a French kiss?
God, she's vulgar!
No one likes to dance?
Did he have to do that to me?
Prevent me from entering
the nightclub.
With everyone looking.
Whenever I recall that,
I can't control myself.
Wake up, Pixote.
Where's Lilica?
She split.
Just as well.
She was pissing me off.
Don't talk about her like that.
-She was nice.
-Go after her, then.
You'd make a lovely couple.
She was fine. It's you who's
the son of a bitch!
Look, if you don't like it,
just get out!
The fewer we are, the better.
You can't say that.
This isn't your house!
-Screw you, son of a bitch!
-Your mother is the bitch.
I saw her giving
her ass to Sapato.
Son of a bitch!
That goddamn whore!
Think I didn't know?
I told you she'd be number one
in my book.
Keep your nose out of other
people's business!
-Do your hear, you asshole?
-Let me go!
What time is it?
Up we go!
Fucking gringo!
Let's go and make babies.
Sit there, gringo.
Drink it!
Wait a mom.
I'll soon finish you off.
Let me give you a kiss.
Don't push!
Don't do that.
Let me kiss you there.
You scumbag!
Keep still, creep.
Or you're dead!
Get him, Dito, get him!
I told you not to say my name!
Look out, Dito!
Shoot, Pixote, shoot!
Let's go, Sueli.
Dito was a nice guy.
I know.
Don't talk about him.
Dito's dead.
I was getting to like him.
Lilica was right to fall for him.
My family lives in Minas.
We could go there.
Come with me.
Don't go away.
I can't live on my own.
What's the matter, Pixote?
Come with me, will you?
What's the matter?
Don't be like that, Pixote.
Everything's ok.
Sueli's here.
It's all over.
Suck it, my baby.
Mummy's with you.
Let go, Pixote.
Let go! I don't like it!
Take your dirty mouth off me!
I'm not your mother!
You hear?
I'm not your mother!
I don't want a child!
I hate children!
Go live your own life!
We'll all get by on our own.
Scram!
Go!
