Those are the Beatles,
those are,

formally known as Britain,
where an epidemic
called Beatlemania
has seized
the teenage population.
MAN: Usual

Hundreds and hundreds
of young Beatles fans.
The younger generation
is going to hell.
Just gorgeous.

Their haircuts and clothes,
they're setting a new fashion.

They sound different.
They're confident,

PAUL: By the end,
it became quite complicated,
but at the beginning,
things were really simple.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you very much!
PAUL: A lot of
people thought we were
an overnight sensation.
We weren't.
People didn't realize
we had all this development.
They just saw these four things
that looked alike
with this haircut,
and they knew how to play.
And they were a bit
of a laugh, you know,
because that's
what we'd been doing
all those years previously.
JOHN: I had a group.
I was the singer and the leader.
I met Paul, said do you
wanna join me band, yeah,
and then George joined.
We were great
live performers then.
I don't think anybody
in the world saw us
outside of Liverpool
and the few places
where we traveled to,
because that's when
we had to perform live
to a small audience
in the dance hall.
We had to hold them.
PAUL: We were
just playing all the time.
Then we went out to Hamburg,
and that was a real slog.
We were playing, sometimes,
eight hours a day.
I was right in the middle
of the naughtiest city
in the world at 17 years old.
It was kind of exciting.
RINGO: I was with Rory Storm.
We were like
the top band in Liverpool,
and for some reason,
this guy in Hamburg
decided to come to Liverpool
and take
all the bands
to Germany to play.
Well, we went to see these
punks, and that was it.
PAUL: I still remember
that moment the first time
Ringo played with us.
Bang, he kicks in.
And it was an Oh My God moment.
I remember looking, and we're
all looking at each other
like, yeah, this is it.
Whoo, I'm getting
very emotional.
JOHN: Once we got
Ringo, we started to do better,
and sort of
do it professionally.
You know, for me,
I'm an only child.
I felt like I suddenly
had three brothers.
RINGO:
We just wanted to play.
Playin' was
the most important thing.
GEORGE: Hamburg was
a bit messy, I mean, to sleep
all huddled together
in one room.
There were no bathroom
or anything,
but then we'd had
practice because
we didn't have a bathroom
at home.
JOHN: We used to have this
saying that I used to chant,
and they would answer.
When they were depressed,
you know,
when the group was going nowhere
and this was a shitty deal,
we're in a shitty dressing room,
I'd say, where we goin' fellas?
And they'd go‐‐
GEORGE: To the top, Johnny.
JOHN: And I'd say,
where's that, fellas?
And they'd say,
GEORGE: To the toppermost
of the poppermost, Johnny.
JOHN: I'd say, right,
and we'd all say, cheer up.
We were always kinda
a little nervous
before each step
we went up the ladder,
but we didn't realize
what was to come.

I was living in Sweden,

I remember, I went day after day
and stood outside
the hotel at the end of school,

their figures on a balcony.
Once a day, the Beatles
would come out and wave.
PAUL: Hello,

GEORGE: Hello, people there.

CURTIS: They were like a gang.
Do you know what I mean?
They each had their
little characteristic.
I mean, John was
surprisingly fearless.
Paul was surprisingly cute.
Ringo was cheeky

At one time the queue

PAUL:
It was disturbing for us.
It was a mixture of all
these sort of strange things,
you know,
where the world was at.
It was scary.
But in all truthfulness,
we were more in our own heads,
you know, being in a band.
You know, we were lads.
It was like,
this is our journey,
and things have been
falling to place
outside of our consciousness.
Even the first trip to America.
There was no plan.
You could not plan it.
PAUL: I'd been very fussy

British Elvis Presleys?

Are you going to get

That's no lie.
The Beatles were cheeky, kind

Yes, long distance calling
for the manager of the Beatles.
May we have his name, please?
WOMAN: Their manager's
name is Mr. Brian Epstein.

PAUL: Looking back now,
it was Brian Epstein.
He was the guy
who got us famous, really.
Brian was class.
That was what Brian was.
He was like Liverpool class.
When Brian was 27, he was
a grownup, and he had a car.
(laughs)
The Beatles' parents
were Liverpudlian,
working class people that
had been through a war.
Our playgrounds were bombsites.
His parents ran a record shop.
VINTAGE REPORTER:
Seems a funny sort of world
for a young man
like you to be in.
How did you get into it?
How did you start?
I heard about them
through a lad
who was asking
for a record by them
in one of my stores,
or my family's stores,
in October, 1961.
Growing up, my mom always
wanted me to talk proper.
You know, all of us, really.
You know, like, I talk
like I'm from Liverpool.
Fuck you, I'm tellin' you,
don't give me any hard time.
PAUL: Whereas Brian
was very well‐mannered,
very well‐spoken, so we
felt we could trust him.
EPSTEIN: I went down

at the Cavern Club.
EMCEE: The Beatles
will sing "Some Other Girl."

EPSTEIN: They were fresh,

was a sort of presence,
and there's this terrible
vague term, star quality.
Whatever that is, they had it.

PAUL: He was looking
at our stage presence.
The early days,
it was clear that he had
a vision of us
that was beyond the vision
we had of ourselves.
(classical music)
EPSTEIN: Backstage,
they were playing
around the clubs in Liverpool.
Rather scruffily dressed,
black leather jackets and jeans,
and rather untidy
stage presentation,
but having great fun.
But I don't think
they would have bothered
to do anything about it,
because young,
inexperienced people
are not really very good
at presenting themselves
properly
in the right sort of quarters.
He took us to a tailor...
and we went to this guy,
and he made us up suits,
you know.
I'm not sure exactly what time
we'll be back in Washington.
We're going
to Washington tomorrow,
and we'll be coming back
on Wednesday.
Bye.
PAUL: Brian
kept us together as a team.

We wrote on the road.
Mainly me and John.
George developed
as a writer later,

an unbelievable writer,
but at the beginning
it was mainly me and John.
So we'd be in a hotel
room with two twin beds,
and he'd have his acoustic
guitar, I'd have mine,
sit opposite each other,
and because
I was left‐handed,
he was right‐handed.
It was like
looking in the mirror.
And we'd just start something
and ricochet of each other.
He'd do a line, I'd do a line,
we'd just write it down.
And when we were finished,
we didn't have a manuscript,
but we had a sheet of paper
with the words,
and we remembered the chords.

Thanks.
But we'll see you, you know,

My relationship
with John was very close.
Musically, you know, we looked
after each other, really.
It's like someone you kind
of looked up to a little bit.
When I first met him,
I talked to people in my life,
and they say,
what do you like to do,
What are your hobbies
and stuff?
And I sort of said,
I like songwriting,
I've written a couple of songs.
And they'd all go,
Oh, yeah, great.
What did you think
about the football?
And I'd go, oh, okay,
nobody interested.
When I said that to John,
he said, oh, so am I.
I go, wow, wait a minute,
big connection here.
I'd never met anyone
who'd written songs.
So that's how we started.

about Hard Day's Night,

This is Larry Kane,
on tour with the Beatles.
Let me give you
a little description
of the dangers of being
with the Beatles.
When we drove up
to the stage door,
the Beatles were
almost crushed completely
by youngsters
who will mash themselves
against the wall,
broke about 50 windows,
throwed rocks, jelly beans,
undershirts, sandals.
The situation
was one of sheer havoc,
even though the police
did their best to stop it.
The first couple of days,
there was a bewilderment.
There was a wondrousness.
Is this really happening to us?
One girl stuck
her hand through the window
and grabbed at my face.
I'm okay, don't worry,
people, I'm all right.
Four cities later,
in Vancouver, British Columbia,
7,000 kids rushed the stage.
Thank you, folks!
Before we do the next song.
DEREK TAYLOR: Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,
the Beatles have come
a long way to do this show.
We have to cut it short
unless you move back.
They're very worried about
the situation in the front.
Back, back, back.
240 kids wound up
in the hospital.
None of the police
in any of these cities
were prepared for this.
Nobody was prepared for this.
Wouldn't you say, Derek,
that police departments
don't realize how bad it is?
DEREK TAYLOR:
I think that's true.
They've all seen crowds before.
I mean, they all say,
we know our own people,
we know the police potential,
and we're going
to be able to handle it.
But what they've never seen
is a Beatle crowd.
This is the biggest thing
that's ever happened.
There's no question about it.
It's like nothing before.
It's not like Presley,
not like Sinatra,
it's not like the late
President Kennedy.
It's the Beatles,
and they are without precedent.
(crowd screaming)
Thank you!
Thank you very much,
everybody, ciao.
You're wonderful, thank you.
Singin' a song from the first
album that we ever made,
a song which
was originally recorded
by a group
called the Shirelles,
just a little chicken.

putting my hair in beer cans

GEORGE: I'm very well,

LARRY: Fine, you glad
to be back in America?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's great.

about the crowds
at Indianapolis.
Back and forth again. The stage
set for Milwaukee tonight.
You can hear the buzz
and excitement
here at the Chicago
Amphitheater.
Now in Detroit, Michigan.
The Beatles really shook
up the crowd in Toronto.
In Montreal, Canada.
Hi, this is Larry Kane,
travelling with the Beatles.
Let me explain to you
the type of feeling
that you get
after 15 performances
watching the Beatles
in action,
and watching the crowds.
It's a chilling feeling
inside
because you know
you are experiencing
a phenomenon that is
the only one of its kind
in this century thus far,
and it probably
will go down in history
as the greatest
show business example
of music and admiration
in many, many hundreds of years.

Remember, too, that in 1964,
there were riots
throughout the South
because of
the civil rights movement.
You started to feel
a social change happening.
‐ Civil rights or civil war!
‐ This is Larry Kane.
The big question mark
still with Jacksonville
not knowing whether
they will be able to perform.
I had received a report from
my station that the Gator Bowl
in Jacksonville
was gonna be segregated,
so I mentioned it
to them in the interview.
What about this comment
that I heard about
concerning racial integration
at the various performances?
PAUL: We don't like it
if there's any segregation
or anything, because
it just seems mad to me.
LARRY: And I could see
Brian at the corner of the room
goin' like, oh my God.
Well, you're gonna play
Jacksonville, Florida.
Do you anticipate any kind
of difference in that opinion?
PAUL: I don't know, really,
it'd be a bit silly
to segregate people
'cause you know, it's
really stupid, isn't it?
You can't treat other
human beings like animals.
GEORGE: That's the way
we all feel.
PAUL: That's the way
we all feel,
and a lot of people
in England feel that way,
you know, because there's
never any segregation
in concerts in England,
and in fact if there was,
we wouldn't play 'em, you know.
During that same summer,
we had the three civil
rights workers in the South
who were missing,
and then found dead.
I was 15,
living in segregation.
It was an apartheid
that's probably difficult
for a lot of people
to even picture.
The only white person
I would even have contact with
was a salesman who would
come into the community.
It was ripe for something
different I think,
at the time I heard that
the Beatles were coming to town.
All of them, by the way,
were very emphatic
about Jacksonville.
They said that if there
was going to be segregation
of any kind, we're not going.
We play to people,
that's what we did.
We didn't play to, like,
those people,
or that people,
you know what I mean?
We just played to people.
It was amazing
that the four of them,
young men seeing the world,
started to act up
and blow back on this
very, very hot
and sensitive issue
knowing that it would really
irritate a lot of Americans.
We had to all decide,
we agreed on a thing,
before we'd do it.
That is one of the classic
things about the Beatles.
Four votes had to be carried
for any idea to go trough.
JOHN: Instead of going
for an individual thing,
we went for the strongest
format, for equals.
That was one thing
to be said about us,
we were very, very close
to each other.
We'd always stick together.
PAUL: We all had to agree,
so there is a strong decision.
You know,
the proof's in the puddin',
it worked really well.
(rock music)
It was my first concert,
and I went by myself.
The only catch in my breath
that I got
was when I went to my seat,
and there were
all those other people
around me,
and I still can feel that
to this day,
that there were all these
white people around,
but I remember standing up
with everybody,
and just yelling
as loud as I could
and singin' along.
That was
the first experience I had
where it was possible
to be around people
who were different,
and at least for a while,
those differences
could disappear.

The people
who ran the Gator Bowl
integrated
for the first time ever,
which from my historical
perspective and study,
ended all that in most of
the big stadiums in the South.
And the next eight days
are probably
the most grueling of the tour.
It looks like the Beatles
are holding up strong.
Every night on the airplane
they would go up,
up to the front of the plane
where the opening acts were,
and kneel down and talk to them.
Every single night,
they would ask them
if they were okay,
because they were
being ignored by the crowd.
This is Larry Kane
traveling with the Beatles,
and they're looking forward
to going back to England,
because they'll be there
for two weeks,
where they'll record records,
and do music,
and that's believe it or not,
another month‐long tour,
this time
in their own country,
sometimes just by bus,
and that's pretty hard.
My mother died
in the summer of 1964,
and somehow or another,
it got to them
that she had passed away,
and Paul and John
both consoled me.
PAUL: John and I,
we both lost our mothers.
Mine had died of cancer,
and his had died
in a terrible road accident,
so that kind of
pulled us together a lot.
You know, bein' teenagers,
we each needed
to do something
that would get us away
from this tragedy, and so
songwriting was it, really.
♪ 'Cause I couldn't
stand the pain ♪
They were very, very sensitive
to other people's feelings.
All four of them.
They were intelligent people
who cared about other people,
who had a sense of themselves.
They also liked
making fun of me.
John, last night
you were very kind,
and Derek was very kind to
invite us up to see the movie,
which we have seen twice.
JOHN: I never
invited him at all.
I just saw him sittin' there
listenin'.
LARRY: Well, anyway.
(laughs)
JOHN: Only kiddin', Larry.
LARRY:
This has been Larry Kane
traveling with the Beatles.
It's extraordinary,
when you think about it
that they were touring
in this kind of circus of life.
The sort of madness
of all that jamboree
of excitement and hysteria.
And yet,
they were able to express
the way they were feeling,
the weirdness of it,
because inside
those Beatles suits,
were composers.
They were writers.
(indistinct voices)
RINGO: Comin' in the wrong,
half way through the song.
Well was it a 12‐bar?
(guitar playing)
The studio was like
our little haven.
Once we got back there,
we knew we could experiment.
Hear ourselves.
And we would write songs
that would be a progression,
and that would be fun to record.
(amplifier static)
GEORGE MARTIN:
Brian Epstein and I
worked together very closely
planning their future.
We agreed that we should put out
a single every three months,
and an album every six months.

DEREK TAYLOR:
I was under pressure
because I got sucked
into the time difference.
I would say to Brian,
you know,
I need more time in the studio,
and he would dole out time,
like giving scraps to a mouse.
One of the great things
about our recording
was the schedule.
You go in at 10 o'clock
in the morning,
tune up, have a ciggy,
have a cup of tea or something,
and then John and I, mainly,
would present the song
that we'd written to everyone.
(guitar music playing)
Just go through it, anyway.
Make mistakes,
just to practice it.
Try to remember,
John, and if I don't,
well, it's just too bad,

comedy actors.

GEORGE MARTIN: Oh, you're

JOHN: I know.
On the early record,
George Martin was a god.
GEORGE MARTIN: To begin with,
I was very much in charge.
I was the kind of schoolmaster
teaching them everything,
and they had to do
what I told them.

one‐and‐a‐half hours

The thing
about the scale is that
writing lots of songs
is not particularly difficult.
Volume is not the thing.
The extraordinary thing
about the Beatles
is the amount of great songs.
Schubert wrote about 800 songs,
of which probably 100 are
absolutely beautiful melodies.
The other 700, pretty good.
The only comparison with that
kind of level of melody
may be Mozart.
Very, very, high volume
of very good melodies.
You have to wait
a long time, then,
'til you get someone
who's up in the hundreds,
and that's when
you hit the Beatles.
Which is why I think you can
compare them in some ways,
because of the sheer
volume of the invention.

There were people coming

And then the press
were getting aggressive.

John got fed up first.
He became agitated
or frustrated
about what was being written,
particularly from 1965 onward.
Richard Lester had said,
we need a song.
And John started it.
So by the time I came
to see him, he had a lot of it.
And it said to me,

kind of autobiographical.
You know, "When I was younger,

This was massive.
The first big stadium tour
in history.
And the biggest show
of them all was New York.
There was the announcement
of this concert,
and I was like, can we?
And my mom was like, We don't
have the money for this.
And then something,
I don't know how she did it,
I don't know,
I don't know how she did it,
but she got two tickets.
And she didn't tell me.
So this is what happened.
She said, "We need to go."
I said, "Where are we going?"
She said, "I'll let you know
when we get there." Okay.
So we're on the train, and I'm
not paying any attention.
And we get up, and I say,
where are we?
And she said,
we're at Shea Stadium.
And I said, why?
And she held up two tickets,
and all I remember
is my head going poof.

GEORGE: It was just amazing,
we don't believe it.
Biggest thing ever,
56,500, someone said.
It's fantastic. It just
knocked you out, you know.
Shea Stadium
is an enormous place.
I mean, that was
the first time it was used
for a rock concert.
Vox made us special,
big amplifiers for that tour,
and they were, like,
a hundred watts.

It just obviously,
you know, wasn't enough.
Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Beatles!

Hello! Hey!

One of the most
remarkable things about
the Beatles playing live
is how in tune they are.
Because, they can't possibly
hear themselves.
I don't think
they had monitors.
They don't sound very big,
even if they were
cranked to the max,
they're not that loud.
I mean, Shea Stadium
being the most extreme,
because I don't even think
there's a P. A. at Shea Stadium.

I remember George bringin'
up the subject with Brian.
Hey, is this touring
gonna be an annual event?
And I think
he was the first one
that brought up the idea of,
Hey, I've had enough of this.
That was the good thing
about being four together.
We're not like Elvis, you know.
I always felt sorry for Elvis
'cause he was on his own.
He had his guys with him,
but there's only one Elvis.
Nobody else
knew what he felt like.
But for us,
we all shared the experience.
They came back to England
late summer of '65.

awards of honor,
a ceremony hallowed
by a tradition
going back over the centuries.

MAN: Do you think the Beatles
should have been
awarded the MBE?
MAN #2: Well, I think
the Beatles have probably
done as much for popular music
than people like Rodgers

The only difference being,
the Beatles have done it
in a matter
of two or three years,
where it took most
other people a lifetime.

JON SAVAGE: They had
achieved something,
and there were,
if you like, influencers,
but at the same time they
were prisoners of their fame.
And I think they were
beginning to chafe
at people's expectations.
The first three months
had been lopped off
to do whatever the Beatles'
third film was going to be.
And then it didn't happen.
And so for the first time
since they'd
become successful and famous,
they had three months off.

looking around.
I got involved
with a gallery owner.
We'd go to Paris
and we'd buy paintings.
We'd go to the dealer.
So it was very exciting.
Of course, George had developed
an interest in Indian music.
(sitar music)
GEORGE: I just wanna carry
on progressing with music,
you know, writing more
and just learning more about it.
I've written so many songs
that I've just thrown away
as I've been writing
them, because I've wanted,
when I finally
recorded one of mine,
I wanted it to be

I feel now I've got more idea
about how to write songs.

We bought this house
in the country
on this estate,
Maureen and Zach, my son,
and John was up the road.
We started to grow up,
and we started
to have families,
and we started
to put less energy
into the Beatle bag.
We all, kind of,
were very aware
that we didn't live in
each other's pockets anymore.
We all had separate existences.
There's an interview
that John Lennon gives
to Morning Cleave,
which is publish in March '66
where he talks
about his reading.
He says I'm not really sure
what I'm going to do next,

they were doing a photo shoot.
JOHN: By then, we were really

John was
not mechanically minded,

and the tape would run off
to the other reel,
and he put it on
like it was the start,
but it was the end of the song,
and that's when the guitar came.

Slow down

making up music as you go along.
"Tomorrow Never Knows"
breaks so many barriers,
musically speaking,
and does so many things
that no one had done before.
It's got a drone
all the way through,
which is something that
happens in Indian music
and used to exist in Western
music in the 12th century.
So it sort of triggered
a whole movement
that popular music would
start to bring in these
other records
from the avant garde,
put them into mainstream songs,
into an album that millions
of people would hear.

JOHN: Hello, this is John
speaking with his voice.
We're all very happy to be
able to talk to you like this
on this little bit of plastic.
This record reaches you
at the end
of a really gear year for us,
and it's all due to you.
When we made our first record
on Parlophone
towards the end of 1962,
we hoped that everybody
would like what would already
been our type of music
for several years already.
But we had no idea of all
the gear things in store for us.
It all happened, really,
when "Please Please Me"
became a number one hit,
and after that, well,
cor' the blimeys,
heave the mo'.
Our biggest thrill of
the year‐‐ well, I suppose
it must have been top of the
bill at the London Palladium
and then only
a couple of days later
being invited to take part
in the Royal Variety Show.
This time last year,
we're all dead chuffed
because "Love Me Do"
got in the top 20,
and we can't believe, really,
that so many things
have happened
in between already.
Just before I pass you
over to Paul,
(Paul barking
like a small dog)
I'd like to say thank you
to all the Beatle people
who have written to me
during the year,
and everyone who sent me
gifts and cards for my birthday,
which I'm trying to forget,
in October.
I'd love to reply
personally to everyone,
but I just haven't enough pens.
In the meantime.
PAUL: This is Paul here.
Everything that John
said goes for me, too.
Especially the bit
about birthday cards
and the parcels, 'cause
all our homes and offices
got sacks of mail last June.
Ow! (laughs)
When it was my birthday.
Anyway, we're all dead pleased
by the way you've treated us
in 1963,
and we're trying to do
everything we can to please you
with the type of songs
we write and record next year.
Oh, yeah, lots of people
asked us what we enjoyed best:
concerts and television
or recording.
We like doing stage shows,
'cause it's, you know,
it's great to hear
an audience enjoying themselves,
but the thing we like best‐‐
I think so, anyway‐‐
is going
into the recording studio.
JOHN: Yes, we enjoy it
very kindly.
PAUL: To make new records.
Which is what we'd
been doing all day
before we started on this
special message.
Well, what we like to hear
most is one of our songs
taking shape
in the recording studio,
one of the ones what John
and I have written.
And then listening
to the tapes afterwards
to hear how it all
worked out, you see.
Ja, Ringo.
RINGO: Hello, Ringo here.
As you know, I was the last
member to join the Beatles.
I started to play drums
in the group 1962.
(laughs)
I've been in a couple
of other groups. Ow!
PAUL: Just wish the people
merry happy.
Go on, for Christmas.
Christmas.
RINGO:
Merry happy New Year,
and folks, happy Christmas,
and may everything
you wish be granted.
PAUL: Sing us Wenceslas,
King Wenceslas.
RINGO: Wenceslas.
♪ Well ♪
(spirited cheers)
GEORGE: Thank you, Ringo,
we'll phone you.
(laughter)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else
has said anything yet
about our fan club secretaries,
Anne Collingham
and Bettina Rose.
(laughter)
Not to mention,
Freda Kelly in Liverpool.
JOHN: Good old Freda!
GEORGE: So on behalf of
us all, I'd just like to say
a great big thank‐you to
Anne, Bettina and Freda
for all the hard work
that they've done,
and we just hope we can go on
pleasing you for a long time.
It's your reaction
to our records
that really matters.
And I'd just like to say...
♪ Brightly was
the shone that night
♪ Though the winter cruel
♪ When a pork pie came in sight
♪ Gathering winter gruel ♪
THE BEATLES:
Merry Christmas, everybody!
