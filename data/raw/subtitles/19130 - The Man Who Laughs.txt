Please! Take me with you!
Hey! Take me!
Hey!
Lift up the ramp.
Do not leave me here, dad!
Save yourself, Gwynplaine!
You can't come with us.
Your presence would cause us trouble.
But I'll be back.
I promise!
Please dad,
don't leave me here!
You will survive!
And I will find you!
You are a part of me.
Hello there!
Open the door!
Help us!
Don't die! Please don't die!
Be quiet damn wolf!
What are you doing there?
Have no place to go?
Oh, not everyone can be happy. Keep
walking, you will find another village.
There you'll find better accommodations.
- I�m just coming back from there.
No one helped me.
- Oh, but listen to this...
there great Christian charity.
Well, come inside. Come on.
It's cold.
Come on!
What are you hiding
there?
Ah, great, that was missing.
Where is she from?
- Not far from here.
Her mother died from cold.
Died? At least she's happy.
Hmm ...
The snow made her blind.
For her is always night.
Dea. Let's call her Dea.
What about you,
what's your name?
Gwynplaine.
- Gwynplaine?
Who did this to you?
The Doctor.
Monsieur Jean ... Pablo.
Is the Doctor Hardquanonne?
The head of the "comprachicos"?
You don't remember anything, do you?
- No.
Not even your parents?
What have they done to me?
Have you never seen it?
Your face looks like
one from a Gargoyle.
But don't worry.
It doesn't make you less human.
rheumatism, insomnia, tuberculosis ...
Every evil has its cure in a leave,
in a root or or in a herb.
Even leprosy or the plague...
Sir, I see you suffer from gout.
Do you know that there is a tree
that could heal you?
You talking about lime tea?
He's not gonna understand you.
To those magical words?
It has no use!
I see the lady
knows herbs as well.
Lime tea but with which
kind of flower?
Queen of the meadows?
The Queen of the meadows!
This name fits with you.
But against gout is the
elderberry flower.
Plants have no secrets with me.
The consultation is free.
But do not forget,
tomorrow at dawn,
will be too late.
I will be gone by then.
Do you think it will work here?
I hope so.
We need money.
Come on, move!
Hmm .. a cat?
No.
And this?
What is it?
You know.
A. .. a wolf?
Almost.
Small, long ...
A fox.
Bravo.
Gwynplaine, he is hungry.
Don't worry, he will be
done in a minute.
There is a farm near the village.
Give them this and they will give
you six eggs and a bottle of milk.
Can I go?
No, it's too dangerous for you.
Go now, run!
Don't forget your scarf.
The scarf!
Do you have a cleft lip?
Thank you, ma'am.
Take off the scarf.
We want to see your cleft lip.
Did you hear? Take it off.
Take this off!
- Stop!
Come on, get him!
Monster! Monster!
Monster! Monster!
Monster!
You should not leave the house!
Leave him or I send the wolf!
Get out of here, you bastards!
Gwynplaine, Gwynplaine!
Gwynplaine, are you okay?
Are you okay?
- Yes, allright.
People are not necessarily bad.
Only when they are afraid.
Everything that is different, unusual,
scares them.
As you grow older your smile
will become more visible.
And people will be more scared of it.
And they will reject you.
That's why you have
to always wear the scarf.
Understand?
Do you think I never had
reason to cry?
However, this one you see
now in front of you,
never, never cried.
I cooked a stew.
Don't need to eat the roots.
It's only to take off the bitterness.
Mmmm!
Mmmm!
God protects only our souls.
But the well-being of our body
is a matter for nature.
Gwymplaine, I'm hungry.
For all evils there are cures.
Infusions, potions, inhalations ...
poultices, gargles.
Knowledge passed down from father to son
since the time of the druids.
The consultation is free. The price of
herbs depends on its rarity.
That having been said,
as a nomad, I know the value of a
piece of bacon or half a dozen eggs.
Observe the face of this child.
Look! He was possessed by the
devil and  he was exorcised.
The devil was cast out of your
body with a large explosion.
This laughter was indelibly marked
in your face for eternity.
Since then, this boy can fight
against the evil eye.
A single strand of his hair is enough
to end any big eye.
Five cents for a piece of his hair.
Come on, there's enough for everyone.
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!
A ... five cents!
Five cents!
The capital of the kingdom.
If there's people in all those houses
it'd take a lifetime to meet them.
But why did we have
to come here?
Fame.
The success of "The Man Who Laughs".
The country became small
for us.
No shame in
admitting that.
The most frequented places are those
offering a bigger chance of success.
You decide, Gwymplaine.
Let's go!
Come on, speak up! 
What do you see?
It's ...
It's wonderful!
What is it?
- A musician.
He is playing with a saw.
A saw to cut trees.
Thank you.
My dear public, the man
you are about to see,
is called Gwymplaine.
As a child, Gwymplaine was abducted by
"comprachicos".
who mutilated his lips.
He had never seen his face.
From that day on, Gwymplaine decided
to hide his face forever ...
in order to not insult
the daylight.
It's starting to get full.
On a stormy day ...
- More and more people.
the carriage of a Prince got lost
in the forest and fell inti a ravine.
Only his daughter, blind,
has survived.
Then came the spring.
As she was blind, he was not
afraid she could see his face.
For one good thing,
another bad one.
They participated in the universal
law which is ...
to please oneself ...
to seek oneself...
and to find oneself.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Can you hear it? It worked! It worked.
- Yes, it worked.
Go back, they're waiting.
Go! Go!
Gwymplaine! One portrait,
just one portrait!
Great for him!
You will see, soon he's gonna be
overimpressed by this success.
Hi there! I would love to have
my neighbors for longer!
What you mean? - I imagine you will be
sailing off tomorrow,
But you're coming with us.
You are part of the show now.
I can't stay there anymore.
I need fresh air.
Come with me.
We leave through the back.
Go.
This way.
Thank you.
Are we close to the water?
Yes, it is a river.
The moon is 
reflecting on it?
Yes.
Must be nice.
It is very ...
very romantic.
It looks so beautiful.
The water shines like
a clear mirror.
Gwymplaine.
I'm afraid.
Of what?
- Fear of losing you in this city.
There are too many people.
Many things that I do not understand.
Do not worry.
No one can separate us.
You notice that we don't spend
much time together anymore?
Like when we were kids.
That's because ...
we are no longer children.
Sometimes I think on
certain things ...
Thoughts that I
shouldn't have.
Why?
Thoughts that a brother
cannot have for his sister.
But you are not
my brother.
And I have these thoughts, too.
You wouldn't have these
thoughts if you could see how ugly I am.
Ugly?
What does it mean to be ugly?
Hurting is ugly.
And you just make
me good.
In our shows ...
when you hear people laughing,
they are laughing at me.
Because of my face.
It's disgusting.
You are wrong.
They laugh because
you make them laugh.
You also make them
feel good.
I can't sleep.
Can I sleep with you?
Hm-hmm.
Dea.
Hm?
What happened between us
was not a good idea.
Let's stay as before.
We have always been happy together, no?
There is nothing better in the
world than to be with you.
I think so, too.
You know what is most important
in the world to me?
You are at the same time
my sister and my daughter.
I like to think like that.
Are you sleeping, Ursus?
Like it was easy.
Don't you think we look happy,
the three of us together?
I have never been happy in my life.
Not even about myself.
I'm only proud of my dry eyes.
I never cried in my life.
Never.
Not for me, not for others.
And you are happy, right?
See that no one sees you. Be discreet,
try to be smaller than you already are.
Happiness will shine through
your ass, then.
What are with these caresses?
And also I'm tired.
Looks like a goddess.
It is more than a goddess.
It's a duchess.
Attracting the royalty
is the first step towards glory.
We should excel ourselves.
- What for?
Well, she knows princes, 
princesses. Even the queen!
The crowned heads have always been
the best clients of "comprachicos".
The court loves the monstruous. Be
monstruous and you will excel yourself.
In her castle, Dea fell
more and more in love with Gwymplaine.
And with Gwymplaine, was the same.
He loved her.
They could not live without each other.
Night after night he could be
seen wandering along the river.
One night he managed to infiltrate
in the palace gardens,
Dea, feeling his presence,
left her room and went downstairs.
Gwymplaine!
Finally!
Gwymplaine was for Dea a brother,
a friend, a guide.
Where everyone could only see
a monster,
she saw an Archangel.
You are so beautiful!
Her blindness could in
fact see
his soul.
If you had eyes to see me,
you would be scared of my ugliness.
The view is something
that hides the truth?
I see nothing,
I feel.
How do you dare to provoke
the Duchess like this?
Whether to ban the show?
And what about that endless kiss?!
They can censor us because of it.
Do whatever you want behind
the curtains, but not in front of them.
A lot of things we do in front of the
curtains we do because you tell us to.
This has nothing to do with censorship.
And also I am the author.
It was the Duchess who provoked me,
with her air of contempt over everyone!
The world is like that.
There's no point in making a scene.
Go give attention to the public.
And let the duchess alone!
Everyone is excited about Gwymplaine ...
but, for me, you were radiant.
They are all talking about the Duchess.
- She must be very beautiful, no?
More than that.
So that's why.
- How so?
I am blind but I know when
you are looking at me.
And you weren't looking at me
earlier when I was talking to you.
Dea, I spend my life looking at you.
As soon as I open my eyes
you are the first thing I see.
Well, I'm gonna have a
walk by the river.
Take this. It will be good for you.
You shouldn't get so attached to
Gwymplaine.
Men are hard to be understood.
Especially when they are successful.
It is dangerous to live only
by one person.
Happy are those who can be happy
only with themselves.
You'll feel better in a minute.
Gwymplaine!
When you were with "comprachicos",
don't you remember seeing a girl
she's about two years.
Redhead with some problem
in her eyes.
No.
I don't remember.
Sir.
Someone is waiting for you.
Follow me, please.
Come on in, Gwymplaine.
Because of you I had a
wonderful evening.
You made me laugh ...
You touched me ...
and disturbed me.
You were less shy early
on the scene.
Had more spark in your eyes.
What do you want from me?
- Your smile.
When I look at you ...
I feel inside of me a fingernail
scratching a blackboard.
I love it.
I've heard the court
loves the monstruous.
It is true. Do you know why?
- So they forget themselves?
Not only that.
The uglier the more fascinating.
You fascinate me.
You attract me.
Don't you think I'm disgusting?
- On the contrary.
I like you,
Gwymplaine.
No man has ever looked at
me like you do.
When you look at me I feel pure.
No one can hear us,
no one can see us ...
Kiss me.
Kiss me as if I were Dea.
Madame ...
I'm glad you enjoyed our show.
I'm yours.
Sorry, Dea.
I could never make you happy.
I just can't.
Only you can make me happy.
Maybe not.
What about Sylvain?
I really like him.
But if I can't hear your voice ...
or feel your presence ...
I will have no more reason to live.
The love of a Princess for a monster
coming from the obscurity.
In vain the two lovers tried to hide.
But they were discovered ...
and Leviathan was punished.
Gwymplaine.
Because God took from them the
small piece of paradise they had,
they could only be together
on the other side.
They left behind them
a trail of pain.
That's the lesson of this fable.
Life is but a long
loss of those we love.
Goodbye, Dea!
If I had been rich ...
and noble as you,
they would have allowed us to love.
The princes, princesses,
the duchess,
can fall in love with their
servants.
But what if a servant dares to
love someone of a higher class?
You will punished!
The hell of the poor is the
paradise of the rich.
What has gotten into you?
Want to get us in trouble?
I say only what you taught me!
If what you want is to insult who
you feel attracted to, just forget it.
I knew you would come back.
So?
Will you dare to get what
you came after?
That's not what I want.
Oh, Gwymplaine.
No man has ever made me feel this way.
You are the solution to my boredom.
I will bring you to the Court.
You will present your show
to the Queen.
You will be rich in a matter of days.
These fairs will be only a
vague memory.
No, ma'am.
The court is not a place for me.
I belong here, to these fairs.
I offer you the Court and
wealth and you refuse?
Yes.
I offer myself to you
and you say no?
Here is where I belong. Your presence
here is an insult to poverty.
Go back to your paradise.
And please,
don't ever come back.
Ursus?
Gwynplaine?
Who's there?
What do you want?
Where is Gwynplaine?
He left.
Do not hurt Gwynplaine.
Who are you?
I'm just a ...
I'm his father.
You're not his father.
- And you are not his sister.
What difference does it
make if there's love involved?
You are not welcome here,
Doctor Hardquanonne. - Ursus!
I am here because of
a promise.
What promise?
Of one day come back
for him.
He will never leave us.
He hates you.
I cast his flesh, shaped his spirit.
He is my work, my creation.
My son.
- Never! He will never be with you.
He loves Dea and "The Man Who Laughs".
He loves success.
He loves to see the shining
eyes of the public.
Especially the eyes from
the beautiful duchess.
You also noticed it, didn�t you?
Ursus!
Hello, Gwynplaine.
It's him!
It's him.
He is Dr. Hardquanonne.
The head of the "comprachicos".
He kidnapped my daughter.
Where is my daughter?
Killer!
Where is my daughter?
His victory will be brief,
Ursus!
Gwynplaine will lose,
just like you.
Gwynplaine!
Think about it again. Let's not waste
this chicken with golden eggs.
It's already decided.
Right Dea?
Yes, I'm looking forward to
going back to our old life.
Listen to the wind hitting
against the trees.
But it's not worth to leave now.
Just when Boucharet started ...
To attract the court?
We have more to do than to
entertain the duchess.
Enough, Gwynplaine.
Stay with Dea, marry with her.
Have a child with her. Two, three!
To educate them, bathe, put to sleep ...
And they will scream and
run around you.
Because our creations are alive!
Think about all of this!
Who among you answers to
the name of Gwynplaine?
I am Gwynplaine.
On behalf of Her Majesty the Queen,
please follow me for a hearing
in the Supreme Court.
He is my kid. 
I�m coming too.
No, sir.
Any attempt to obstruct
this will be punished.
Gwymplaine.
Once again I'm leaving you.
Only this time I
won't be back.
It is him.
Lord Marquis of Clancharlie ...
I'm Barkilphedro,
your valet.
I served your father.
I saw you being born.
And your father, God rest his soul,
went against the king.
The monarch thought he could make your
father surrender by kidnapping you.
You were only two years old.
Your father refused to
give in to blackmail...
And the king, in retaliation, sold you
to Dr. Hardquanonne ...
so he could make you ...
Gwymplaine.
I lived all my life,
Gwymplaine,
surrounded by children.
And I've never got attached
to any of them.
With you ...
I always felt there was something...
different.
I will be available to your lordship,
day and night, in order to help you
have your kingdom back ...
Excuse me ... Gwymplaine.
The young man you brought here earlier.
Where is he?
You can close your business,
Gwymplaine is dead.
Gwymplaine.
Why he had to say those things? Why
to be such a rebel? What imprudence!
He was supposed to stay hidden,
not to expose himself!
They found him in the end.
He's dead!
He is dead! They killed him!
Gwymplaine, my boy, my son!
My son is dead!
Is your Lordship looking
for something?
Yes, the exit.
The exit?
I want to go home, tell my
family I'm fine.
We are in the castle Clancharlie.
As the sole heir of the Clancharlie,
you are at home.
This is your home.
My name Barkilphedro, I'm your ...
- Valet, I know.
Is there any law that forces me
to accept this heritage?
Hmm .. no.
So I rather go back to my old life.
- I respect your choice ...
but I'm not sure you ...
really understand what you
are about to give up to.
Come and see.
All this is yours.
The vineyards, but also the hills
back there.
From the river to the border
with the kingdom,
everything belongs to you.
Castles, forests, farms
and villages included.
And all this is mine?
- Yes, it is.
And the title and privileges.
What do I do with all this?
Whatever pleases your lordship.
No. My place is on
the stage next to mine.
You are not only rich.
You are powerful.
Powerful?
Why powerful?
You have a seat in the parliament.
In the Parliament?
Can I change the laws?
- Yes, like any parliamentarian.
I must have a carriage too.
- Indeed, several.
Wanna know the exact number?
- No.
I want you to prepare me one.
I will get Ursus and Dea
at the fair.
They need to know that.
I'm not sure here would be
the place for such people.
They are my family.
I will never leave them.
I'm gonna get them.
- It's not possible.
Not possible?
I have the power to change the laws ...
but not to leave my own house.
But you can't leave. The Queen is
coming tonight with all the court.
You have to get ready 
for her.
The Queen comes to visit me?
Of course.
And if you want to take your
seat at the Parliament,
before you must officially
receive your title.
And when is the next session?
- In a few days.
If we send a carriage to
your friends ...
they could attend to
the reception tonight.
Very good!
I'm counting on you,
Barkilphedro.
I am here to serve your Lordship.
Sylvain is there.
Good morning, Sylvain.
Morning.
Can you play a bit?
Yes.
More.
Wherever he is right now,
he is living like a prince.
He's waiting for me next to
a marble staircase.
Dea, Gwymplaine will always be
in your heart, as well in mine.
But he didn't turn into a prince.
He is not waiting for you in a castle, 
nor he's coming with a carriage.
Sir Ursus and Madam Dea,
The Marquis de Clancharlie,
known to you as Gwymplaine,
invites you to join him in his
Castle Clancharlie.
A carriage is waiting at the
entrance of the fair.
Your mother.
My mother?
Is she still ...
- No, she died giving birth ...
when the Lord came into the world.
She looks sad.
Your father!
Member of Parliament!
A painting of you shortly
before the kidnapping.
If memory serves me, the painter
almost went crazy,
because it was hard
to make you stand still.
So, how is the castle?
- If that's the one...
looks wonderful.
It is almost as great as the
palace of the Queen.
Must be immense, as in fairy tales.
There will be guards in uniform,
with flags all the way.
It's exactly like that.
I saw it in my dreams.
It looks just like your dreams.
Look at me.
And the queen?
I introduce myself to her?
The Queen has just informed that state
affairs have retained her in the palace.
Ah ...
What a pity.
I had so much to tell her.
I was gonna tell her about
all the misery I saw in the kingdom.
I'm sure she has no idea.
With your permission, your Honor.
I will go to my room.
Your Lordship
the Marquis of Clancharlie.
How ugly!
Is the scarf covering his mouth?
No, his face is uncovered.
Looks like the ass of a monkey.
Unclean!
Repulsive. Abject.
I think it's horrible.
I miss you so much!
I have so much to tell you!
I'm a Marquis now! 
Can you imagine that!
Come with us.
Do not stay here with these people.
They pretend to respect you.
- You are wrong.
They are sufficiently educated
to accept me as I am.
You're the blind one.
They are sufficiently educated
to hide what they really think.
Inside they all think the same
as our public. Even worst.
The duchess has just arrived
and wants to see you.
You should come see her.
Here my title gives me the right
to show my face.
In the Court or in the Parliament.
My son,
you bit the golden fruit.
You'll end up spitting ashes.
So, my cousin?
It seems that now we are cousins.
Should we follow the protocol?
I enjoyed "The Man Who Laughs" in
the fair. I really did.
Girl, you look like what all women want
to see on the other side of the mirror.
The image of purity.
I'm sorry to have to take him ...
but royal life is filled with
tedious obligations.
Come, my cousin.
It's time for the toast.
To fate, that gave me back my title,
my family, and my possessions.
To my father, who always trusted me.
In all circumstances.
To my cousin, who we missed so much.
Finally he is with his real family.
You are so beautiful.
As much as Dea?
It's not the same thing.
- I know.
Dea is pure and intact.
She is beautiful like an angel.
Untouchable.
I am beautiful like a woman.
A woman you want.
You want to touch,
you want to caress.
Gwymplaine ...
we were made for each other.
The monster that you are outside,
I am inside.
I was looking for you.
We wait our driver to
take us back home.
Ah!
The Marquis finally escaped from
his obligations.
And he is resting now.
If you wish to go and
meet him ...
Oh no! Only Dea is
requested by your lordship.
For now.
You can go.
Walk a few steps ahead.
The Marquis, or rather Gwymplaine
will be waiting for you.
Just behind the bed.
Oh, Gwymplaine ...
I love you.
Say it again!
I love you!
Hey, guys!
Look at what we got here!
Stop! Are you looking for the exit?
Yes!
- Then follow me.
Follow me, milady.
Come, come on.
Come, come ...
No, no, here, here ...
This way.
Over here!
Just do not lose anything.
Let's have some fun.
Let's dance.
Let her go!
Stop it!
I will smash your heads!
Cowards!
It's with the weak that the mean
show his worst side.
Come, Dea.
Cowards!
Even when we don't see you
you are present anyway, Barkilphedro.
Something I have in common
with the ghosts.
Or with the rats.
- Do not be so severe, Lady Duchess.
We have common interests.
Common interests?
If Gwymplaine renounce to his title
you lose your yours of chamberlain.
If he leaves you will be nothing.
This is your interest.
What would be mine, in your opinion?
I noticed lady feels something ...
different for your cousin.
You may not like very much to see him
back with the young Dea.
I do not need you,
Barkilphedro.
And I never asked you to serve
me this young lady's head on a tray.
I would offer you her soul.
But I wasn't asked to.
Your servility disgusts me.
I don't want to harm Gwymplaine.
His fate now no longer interests me.
I received this from the coachman
who drove the artists.
He was told to deliver it
to the Marquis.
Gwymplaine,
I know you have to do
what your heart says.
We will wait as long as it on Thursday.
I know you will come back.
I know that your tenderness, 
your trust and your love
are the most important parts of the
fortune you will always have.
Ursus and Dea.
Give a good money
to this driver ...
and tell him that his
duty was accomplished.
Hey!
No one disturbs the Marquis.
I hope that Your Lordship
slept well.
I wish you a great day.
Your breakfast will be served
in a minute.
Take it as you get ready for the day
as there are several hearings scheduled.
Are Ursus and Dea comfortable?
Oh, your lordship did not know?
They returned last night.
Despite of our insistence.
It was my fault, I should have taken 
care of them myself.
Well, I'm going to see them.
Ursus left you a letter.
Gwymplaine,
We don't belong to the
same world anymore.
Each must live in his.
You found your destiny,
and we must follow ours.
I prefer to be among artists
than with the royalty..
Dea can not compete
with a duchess.
Let's leave it like this,
it will be better.
Be happy if you can. 
And forget us.
It's not possible.
I'm going to talk to them.
They will understand.
They left the city this morning.
No one knows where to.
I'm sorry your lordship.
Thank you, my cousin, for this
deliciously melancholy concert.
My cousin, I need to talk to you.
Unfortunately
I do not have time to hear it.
Last night you had time.
Last night I wanted everyone to know
how abject I am.
Today they all know.
I know you loved me...
in your own way.
I can have the man I want.
The most beautiful, the most brilliant.
But a man grotesque and ridiculous
a disgraceful man,
was great.
Do not forget that I am just like you.
Better, you are my mirror.
If my soul could talk
it will laugh.
Now I see your true face.
And I love as you are, anyway.
Do you love me?
Your laughter is sadder than mine.
Gwymplaine.
The Marquis de Clancharlie.
Your Majesty ...
members of the parliament.
I am the Marquis of Clancharlie.
But my real name is a name
from the poor:
Gwymplaine.
Some of you knew my father.
I've never met him.
I am a miserable,
made from a great man,
by a king for his work and grace.
But my heart is not here.
But I felt I need to
address myself to you.
Why?
To warn you.
Gentlemen, I'm here to tell you
the latest news!
The human race exists!
Lower the look.
Look around you, beneath you.
You are marching on
thousands of heads.
Observe the laws you create.
Yes, people are terrible.
There is unemployment everywhere.
We want grimace, not speeches.
Minstrel! Shaker!
Clown! Get out of there!
Idiot!
Laugh, yes laugh louder!
I've already suffered all
contempt one could.
I grew up in the poverty.
And shivered in the winter.
The hunger, I had a taste of it.
I drank the shame.
And I will vomit it on you.
Enough Sir Clancharlie!
Stop immediately with this,
unworthy of a gentleman.
Honor your position!
Majesty!
What they have done to my face,
you do with people.
They are mutilated.
You deformed their rights,
their justice, their truth,
and reason and intelligence.
As I am deformed because my mouth.
Look at me.
I am the people.
Take care, Your Majesty!
The real lord will come
knocking at the door.
Clown!
Laugh as much as you can,
gentlemen!
One day you won't be masters anymore.
No more kingdom!
No more unequality.
No more ignorance!
And courtisans, and ballet,
and the king!
Only freemen and the light!
Go back to your cage!
And you go back to your wealth!
To your indigestion!
One day we'll eat your guts!
We will eviscerate you. With our teeth
we will rip your hearts off.
My dear.
My child.
If you could leave behind an illness
the same way we leave a city ...
you could hear the breeze
knocking on the trees.
Unfortunately Gwymplaine left.
And here you are.
Laying in the arms of death.
Calm down. Everything is gonna be fine.
Gwymplaine?
Oh, Gwymplaine ...
Forgive me, Dea.
We are together.
All evil is over.
No need to be afraid anymore.
Oh, Gwymplaine ...
My love.
What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.
I felt a blow, a blow of happiness.
I felt something pounding
in my chest.
What's wrong with you?
She took arsenic.
There is nothing else to do.
I will die, Gwymplaine.
You can not die.
You're all I have, Dea.
It's too late.
How difficult it is to be happy.
Remember when we were kids?
And we slept under the bearskin?
I need to say it again:
I love you, Gwymplaine.
Do not forget my voice.
Take me to the river.
It was there where we first kissed.
It was like we would stay
together forever.
What a beautiful life we had.
I would like to have lived longer.
Gwymplaine!
Will you remember me?
I will need it when I will be dead.
Do not let me waiting
for you too long, Gwymplaine.
Kiss me one more time.
The light!
I can see it ...
