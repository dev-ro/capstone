I won't talk to you.
You will also leave me.
Grandfather too is leaving.
When you grow wings,
you too will fly away.
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya
has embraced Jainism...
for which he is abdicating,
giving up his throne...
his kingdom and his people.
Grandfather, Asoka has taken
your sword. He says it is his.
You are leaving me,
but the sword is mine.
Asoka, my son, this
is not just a sword.
It's a demon.
When drawn, it hungers blood.
It doesn't see friend or foe.
It sees only blood. Just blood.
Before it can do more harm,
let us get rid of it.
"This is not just a sword.
It's a demon.
It doesn't see friend or foe.
It sees only blood. Just blood."
The Takshila army is mightier
than ours.
Half our army has not reached.
General Shivrath, hasn't reached...
or my brother Susima
has not let it reach?
We will not lose. For even if
wars are fought on battlefields...
they are won by the mind.
Takshila army, keep moving.
Prince, Takshila army is advancing.
Stop them, General,
by force or by deceit.
Their army has been halved.
Now they want to surrender.
The enemy deserves a chance.
Don’t you agree, General?
Takshila's flags are down.
We want to surrender, Prince.
Our army has laid down their weapons.
Takshila kneels before Magadha.
Surrender to me.
The weapon is with me.
That is no weapon.
This is a weapon.
The head that won't bow to us
will be cut off.
What are you taking with you?
Nothing.
All that and you say it's nothing?
Give us some of it.
Should I?
That's too much.
Want more?
- No, we'll share it.
You better smarten up.
Prince Asoka is arriving,
victorious from Takshila.
The stars never lie.
- Damn your stars.
Susima's mother is King Bindusara's
favored queen.
With her around no one will
dare eye the throne.
And what of Asoka’s mother,
Queen Dharma?
She is less of a Queen
and more of a slave.
Only Prince Susima
can claim the throne.
Where is Susima?
General Shivrath.
The great General Shivrath.
It is you who suggested that
Asoka be sent to Takshila.
You said he would lose, didn’t you?
"Send him with half the army
and he won’t return alive."
You said so, right?
Then what is this?
What do we do with you now?
You have failed.
What is the fate of a defeated soldier?
Let me be sentenced to death.
Defeat hasn't crushed the warrior's
ego. He still holds his head high.
I want him to lower his head.
These arms and medals
belong to Magadha's proud army.
Do you think you deserve all this?
No.
Take them off.
Strip him naked.
Here, brother.
The General is now ready for war.
He has lowered his head.
Now you can kill him.
You don't know Asoka. I have tried
to kill him all of eleven times.
Don't worry.
Asoka will die for sure.
You know your job well.
I advise you to attack him while
he is bathing in the river...
when he is most vulnerable...
emerging out of the water, then...
All I want is to know who sent you.
Long live King Susima.
You missed. Again.
See, there isn't a scratch on me.
I want you to leave Magadha.
- Why should I?
The coming six moonless nights
are not auspicious for you.
My good or bad luck rests
with my sword.
Is that your wish? I run away?
I'm no coward.
I'm not afraid of anyone, Mother.
- But I'm afraid.
How can you know a mother's pain?
9 months I nurtured you in my womb.
I am your son, Mother.
I will understand your pain.
Even if I have to carry you around
for nine months.
Let me know your pain, Mother.
You are right, Mother.
Nine moments maybe...
but for nine months, you're too heavy.
Don't change the subject,
will you leave or not?
I heard you. I promise, Mother.
Asoka.
- I promise, Mother.
I promise, pundit-ji.
How are you?
We've not met since your return.
I heard that someone tried to kill you.
Someone did try to kill me, yet again.
Who would want that, Asoka?
A fool that misses each time.
Beware, Asoka.
One shouldn't underestimate the enemy.
He who faces me with a sword
Not someone who lunges from behind.
Either way, the one who survives
ascends the throne.
No, Susima.
The throne belongs to the one...
who has the courage to sit on it.
That's a childhood trait of yours.
What I want, what I like...
is your desire too.
You even took Grandfather's sword.
Get off the throne, Asoka.
Make me do so, Sugatra.
Not like this, Sugatra.
If you must have the throne
then fight for it.
In front of everyone.
Meet me tomorrow morning
and I'll fight you, before everyone.
Tomorrow morning...
in front of everyone.
Sleep well, Asoka.
Tonight is your last night.
You are finished.
I will fight him.
Go ahead... fight him.
He dared to sit on the throne today.
Tomorrow, he may raise the sword
on me.
Your Majesty, it is my belief that
we analyze the situation...
Prime Minister, my belief is
that you stay silent.
It's you who has encouraged him.
- Why blame the Prime Minister?
Asoka is under Dharma's control.
Stop him, Dharma.
If something should happen tomorrow...
the blame will be entirely yours.
What's happening here?
Mother is taking a vow of silence.
- That will not happen here.
Everyone, leave.
What childishness is this?
A vow of silence, for life?
You won't talk to me ever again.
Why, Mother?
She won't speak to anyone.
Mother says why speak
when her own child turns a deaf ear?
Mother wants you to leave Magadha
and strive to live an ordinary life...
Give her your word that no one will
come to know you’re Prince Asoka.
I must go? Leave?
So that others can laugh at me
for running away scared?
You don't want your son to sit on the
throne? But I wanted it for you.
Here. I give in. Now speak to me.
Vitasoka, tell Mother to greet
an ordinary man.
Mother's like you, brother.
She won't speak till you leave.
All right, I'll go.
Even if you ask, I won't return.
Speak to me.
Brother won’t be here.
He has gone, leaving Magadha.
Gone? So he's scared.
The brave Prince has fled
to save his life.
Idiot. Change your tune.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Friends like us have nothing to hide.
Last night, when I went home,
my wife was not there.
Where did she go?
When I asked her in the morning...
she said she was
with her friend, Kamini.
Silly. She must have been with Kamini.
You idiot, I was with Kamini.
No, I was with Kamini.
I was there too.
You must have gone after me.
Strange. My wife’s name
is also Kamini.
That dark one?
- Yes.
Have you heard? Prince Asoka
has gone leaving Magadha.
He must have gotten scared
of Prince Susima.
When Jupiter enters
its twelfth position...
every great man must go into exile.
- Really?
Like Rama, Pandavas, Princes.
Strange.
You're not from here. Who are you?
An ordinary traveler.
The sun remains the sun
even behind clouds.
Your destiny indicates
that you are in no way ordinary.
What lies in my destiny then?
That I am a prince?
One day I will be enthroned?
Be an emperor?
Even emperors are ordinary.
Your destiny transcends the throne.
Whose destiny can surpass
that of an emperor's?
A traveler's... when his journey
has been completed.
Eat, child. In Kalinga no one
goes to sleep hungry. You eat too.
Here, Pawan. It's good food.
Pawan, eat this. It's tasty.
Why should you eat? You too
miss Mother's hand feeding you.
No fuss. I'm an ordinary man.
You an ordinary horse.
No royal palace
or sumptuous dishes for us.
Now, it's the ground to sleep on...
the open sky above...
and pretty princesses
who now exist only in our dreams.
Go, you searching wind, go away
Go seek out my beloved
One good enough for me
It cannot be...
If there is...
Then maybe we can be together
Go... go...
The sky is a poet's page
And I its poem
Someone like me...
Is rare in this world
Touch me not...
That's a dare...
It would start raging fire
Go... go...
I didn't see a thing.
I was just listening.
You swim...
I mean you sing very well.
What's your name?
I don't talk to strangers.
- Stranger?
Do you not feel
that we have met before?
In some other place, in another time...
somewhere?
Who are you?
Pawan (the Wind). And you?
Why are you following me?
Your voice drew me.
I am warrior blood. You risk death.
I am dead.
My warrior.
Pawan, this place is unfit for a horse
like you. Wait here.
Look, another one in search
of the same thing.
You won't find...
Nobody will.
Who?
- Not who, 'What'.
100 shining, clinking gold coins.
Reward for finding Prince Arya
and Princess Kaurwaki.
You’re very pretty.
And you're the prettiest, Meghna.
Meghna? My name's Urvashi.
- Doesn't matter, you're all pretty.
Who is there? Will someone dare
to take up my challenge?
Friend, you seem new here.
How about you?
Come, show us your mettle.
Go... go.
Brave youngsters these days
parade around with twigs.
Give it back.
- Sit. Win it back.
What's your name?
- Pawan (the Wind).
A horse's name.
His father must be 'Badal' (cloud).
Look behind...
There's no one.
You won by cheating.
- Either way, I won.
You must fight me again.
- Let go.
I will not.
No way out.
You'll have to fight.
Where were you last night?
I've been waiting for ages.
Who are all these people?
Come home now, I'll show you.
You are the first to defeat Virat.
Come with me.
You've not been drinking, have you?
- No.
You take over the bullock cart.
It's dangerous to drink and ride.
He's right, let's go.
Woke up, finally? Will you just
sit around? Or will you work?
What work?
- You must work if you want to stay.
If not, you should leave.
I can do any kind of work.
This work I cannot do.
Greetings. I'm new to this.
You could face some discomfort.
Even so, please don't move.
And please don't kick.
Your eyes too are beautiful.
You? Why are you following me?
I am following you?
Yesterday I was in the forest and
you emerged from the waterfalls.
Now you're here on the pretext
of getting milk.
And what were you doing in my dream
last night?
At least tell me your name.
Give me the milk.
- Look, over there.
Hey, Warrior.
Stop. Princess Kaurwaki.
Yes, we found her.
The 100 gold coins are ours.
100 gold coins for her?
Back off. She is ours.
- Know how to swim?
Yes, of course.
And you?
That's good.
Lets go.
You crazy? If you can't swim then
why jump into the water?
What's wrong? Seems all of Kalinga
is after you...
Princess Kaurwaki.
You're among them. For you,
all I mean is 100 gold coins.
I couldn't put a price on you.
The earth doesn't have
enough gold for that.
Stay with Arya. He is alone.
Stop. Who sent you?
Drink up.
When I'm king,
there will be food for all.
Don't tell anyone.
Who is this? Is he dead?
- It's just an injury. Go back inside.
How did he get hurt?
- Bheema hit him. Go inside.
Did he come to kill me?
Arya, go inside.
Why did you bring him here?
You know it's dangerous.
Why did you hit him?
- Arya, go inside.
First tell me, why you hit him.
- Arya, go inside.
Why did you bring him here?
He could be anyone,
a murderer, an assassin...
He saved my life, Bheema.
- Don’t you know why?
He's after the same thing:
100 gold coins.
You may take your life lightly
but Arya is my responsibility.
Arya is my brother, General.
- Let's go then.
I can't leave him in this condition.
- You'll have to.
We are leaving from here.
- General, are you ordering me?
No. I'm just trying
to make you understand.
The rest is up to you.
Forgive me, Prince.
Please have your meal now.
Here, I'm Prince?
Inside you scold me?
Scold me then after eating.
- I don't wish to eat.
I want to go home
- Yes, Prince. We leave tomorrow.
Not tomorrow, today.
- I said tomorrow.
It's always tomorrow.
When I am king everything
will be settled today.
No tomorrows.
Kaurwaki...
Kaurwaki, give it to me.
Mother, look at Kaurwaki.
Mother.
It's all right.
It was only a nightmare.
I want to go home.
- Yes. We will go.
Where is Prince Arya?
I assure the senate that
Prince Arya will soon be with us...
to take the royal place
of his late father.
I have announced a 100 gold coin
reward to anyone who finds him.
It's not just a matter
of finding Prince Arya.
The King's assassins roam free.
What's happening in Kalinga?
Answer me.
There is a conspiracy brewing
in Kalinga.
The person involved is here
in this senate amongst us.
Who is he?
- You.
Or you. It may even be you.
- Me?
It could be anyone.
Suspecting each other is futile.
It's your responsibility to find
the culprit, Prime Minister.
We trust you.
Kaurwaki...
Kaurwaki...
Now Kaurwaki? Last night
another name was on your lips.
Is that so?
And what were you doing
so close to me last night?
Don't go. It still hurts...
If you leave, the pain will get worse.
My Warrior, listen.
- I don't want to hear.
But I want to say it.
- Fine. Say it.
Can I come close and say it?
- What are you doing?
Nothing?
- I saw him trying to tell you something.
He was telling me a story.
- I want to hear it too.
But I don't know any stories.
- I order you. Tell me a story.
Prince, don't get angry.
I will tell you a story.
Once, there was a prince.
- Like me?
A little older. He left his kingdom
and roamed the jungle.
Like us? Then what?
- One day he heard something...
Someone was singing.
The voice drew him to a waterfall.
He saw a princess, bathing...
Her lovely body, head to toe,
glistening with water drops.
And the prince fell in love.
At first sight.
- I knew it. Then?
Said the prince to the princess,
"You sing beautifully! '
The princess got angry,
picked up her sword.
Why? The prince didn't do anything.
He watched her bathe, you see.
- So? I too bathe in the open.
You're different.
The Princess had no clothes on her.
Arya, supper's ready. Come eat.
- But I want to hear the story.
First eat. Then the story.
How are you now?
- I 'm fine.
I must find the rascal
who hit me from behind.
This rascal. He hits everybody.
We should leave now.
- By the way, where are you headed?
Kalinga.
That's where I am going too.
We won't trouble you. Let's go.
Tell me the story.
Rascal.
What is this?
Left your work without warning?
Work when you please. Leave
when you please. This won't do.
She went away.
She didn't even look back.
Is it done?
Come, get ready.
Come, get ready.
Let's catch the evening boat.
Let's get on it. Come, let's go.
There will be an anchor, somewhere...
Somewhere there 's a shore...
Let's go. Let's go.
Prepare yourself, then let's leave
Whether we swim or we sink...
We have to get across
The evening will be so pleasant
The words will be mine.
But the thought yours
The talk will be innocent...
sweet, diluted with honey
What is this surge of love?
Do I drown to experience it?
Can 't you tell what it is?
Where could it lead?
The heart will burn,
the eyes will fill
You fight very well.
Here, straighten this.
I ' II be leaving too.
- Wait.
The fight is not over.
- I warn you.
I have learnt the art of battle
from the great texts.
I know 18 tactics of fighting.
I do too.
All 18?
- All 18 of them. Come, fight.
Tell me, friend.
Do you know the 19th tactic?
Which is this 19th tactic?
The 19th tactic?
In the 19th tactic the warrior
fights his foe blindfolded.
Like this.
Pawan, Pawan.
Quiet, everyone.
What's new in that?
Even I know this tactic.
Prepare yourself.
Have you got the blindfold on?
- Yes.
You can't see anything?
- Not a thing.
You hit first.
Try again.
Keep at it.
Friend, remember... the '19th' tactic.
Quiet.
Will he be back?
Who, Pawan?
Yes, Pawan. I want to hear the story.
Here you go, prince. Eat some fruit.
Bheema, know any stories?
No.
No for everything.
Tell us, who are you?
What are you doing here?
Princess, hide.
Were you looking for me?
When you left you did not look back
even once.
Take care of Arya.
Don't leave them, Bheema.
He will kill everyone.
Well, what's this?
The sun pendant.
It is our Prince Arya, isn't it?
Look, our Prince got scared.
Don't be afraid, Prince.
We won't do anything to hurt you.
You fight well.
Where did you learn?
I'm a soldier in the Magadha army.
You, soldier of Magadha army?
And I'm the General of Kalinga.
That makes us enemies.
Enemies.
How long?
How much longer will it take?
Do I have to wait for eternity
to ascend the throne?
Find Prince Arya and kill him.
As proof, hand me the sun pendant
he wears around his neck.
Go.
Why a sword in such beautiful hands?
I want to be as skilled as you
in wielding the sword.
To fight the evil ones.
- Who are they?
The ones who killed my parents.
I'm with you, Kaurwaki.
I will always be close to you.
I don't want to depend on others.
Then, hold the sword like this.
Let it be a part of your body.
Let it connect to your soul.
No fear, no hesitation...
No sense of life or death.
Focus only on your target.
Not like this.
Eye to eye...
Never shift your eyes
from your enemy.
I just touched my warrior
and she took offense.
Just imagine, she pushed me.
You men. You could not have said
or heard anything.
Probably grabbed the girl's hand.
- I did. So?
You need to be gentle with girls.
Some love, some flowers...
say some words of love.
Say what? Love speaks for itself.
Are you afraid of expressing love?
- I 'm not afraid of anything.
Nonsense. Tell me, how does one
go about this love talk?
Here. Hold these flowers. Take it all.
Go tell her...
I love you... you alone.
I can't think of anything but you.
After meeting you
my world has changed.
I have changed.
I can't understand anything.
If I keep silent, I'll go mad.
All that? I can't do it.
Hold this? You have to say it.
I'm In love with you
- Right.
Only you.
- Perfect.
Keep at it and
I'll get some more flowers.
Ever since I have met you,
everything's changed.
I have changed,
you seem changed.
I can't think of anything
or anyone else but you...
You.
Your love story brings tears
to my eyes.
Now your tears will flow.
My friend, not today.
Somebody is waiting.
They'll have to wait a lifetime.
Virat, my friend...
- Nothing will work today.
No blindfold, no 19th tactic.
Today nothing will work.
What if I say
there's someone behind you?
I won't look back.
There's someone behind you.
- I know there's no one.
Virat, somebody is there.
You're cheating again.
Telling me lies?
I'm leaving, my friend.
So? You promised you'll be
with me forever.
After that day, I see you today.
I won't speak to him ever,
didn't even tell me before he left.
Are you crying?
First, you fight with Pawan.
Then you sit here and cry?
Why should I cry?
What have I to do with him?
- Look, Pawan's horse.
You glass doll...
Sealed in your lips
is the lilt of love
But you won't speak
Or utter it
It lingers on your eyelashes
And lurks on lowered eyes
Come, listen.
Sweeter than sugar
are your veiled eyelids
You don 't open your eyes
or reveal what they say
If you wish to cross the hills
I'll move mountains for you
If you seek shelter in the clouds
I'll ward off the monsoon rains
A bird in the sky will guide
you to the hill where the sun rises
Please introduce yourself, beautiful
Your smile is sweetness
You are a foreigner, will forget
me easily. Give me your promise
So I can wear it like a jewel
The prime minister of Magadha
has sent a message.
Please continue with the story.
The story... where were we?
The Princess's clothes...
She wore them, walked away,
and the prince followed her
Why?
Lovely princess,
alone in a dark forest...
What of wild animals?
Any wild animal seeing a
lovely princess would follow.
Then what happened?
The princess turned around
and said, "I am a princess...
lf you follow me you
will get a tight slap".
The prince left then?
No, he was shameless.
Is this your story or mine?
You tell it then.
No, you tell it.
Why would our prince who braved
death bother over a slap?
He kept following the princess.
Suddenly, three monsters appeared.
Where was the prince from?
The prince had no kingdom.
It was stolen from him.
Just like us.
Someone stole our land as well.
Someone stole our Kalinga.
So what?
The sun is yours, the moon too.
All the stars up there are yours.
No one can take that away from you.
Really?
- Yes.
What's more, no man can
take your land away from you.
I'm there with you.
I'll get your land back for you.
Hey, warrior.
I... listen to me.
I have not told anyone this before.
Kaurwaki... listen.
Please listen.
Tell me.
Kaurwaki, I love you, only you.
I can't think of anything
or anyone but you.
Ever since I have met
you everything has changed.
I have changed.
I don't know what to do.
If I didn't tell you,
I would lose my mind.
I love you, only you.
I can't think of anything
or anyone else but you.
Ever since I have met you
everything has changed.
I have changed.
I'm glad you told me.
If you didn't,
I would lose my mind.
That's exactly what I said.
But you should say it like this.
Where were you?
With Pawan.
What were you doing?
Is this the way to behave?
That too with an ordinary soldier?
Bheema, don't forget who
it is you are talking to.
That's why I am speaking out.
It is not right for you
to associate with Pawan.
Careful, Bheema. I love Pawan.
You love Pawan?
Who is Pawan?
Where does he come from?
He says four nice words
to you and you think it's love?
How do you see it?
You think I don't know what love is?
You don't.
You don't know the difference
between love and a commoner's lust.
Don't forget
that you are just a General...
and I'm a princess.
You are my servant.
A slave to my royal family.
Yes, I'm a servant.
But who are you?
You think you are a princess?
The family you are so proud of...
What did you say?
What about my family?
Tell me, Bheema.
You were found by a fisherman.
Your origin is unknown.
No one knows your lineage...
The king adopted you.
Who am I then?
Nobody knows.
My warrior, why are you here alone?
I know what you are thinking.
Me, a princess. He, a mere soldier.
Arriving with his heart,
horse and sword.
Warrior. What happened?
What's wrong?
I am no warrior, Pawan.
Those who I thought
were my parents...
I am not of their blood.
They found me, Pawan.
They raised me as an orphan.
I have no identity, Pawan.
What difference is there...
between the blood of a warrior
and that of an ordinary man?
Nothing's changed. I love you.
Who do you love? Who am I?
You are my warrior, my princess.
Come with me.
Look. Look at the flame.
Are you going to push me away again?
Not so quick.
Tell me, what's my wedding gift?
I've given you my heart. What more?
Your horse.
He's yours.
Your sword.
- That too.
Your clothes.
Not in front of the horse.
What are you doing?
My Warrior... no... no...
I'll be right back.
Stand upright, don't bow.
Greetings, Prince Asoka.
Embrace me.
Why are you here?
Your mother wants to meet you.
Tell Mother I will not return.
She is very ill.
You may go.
What's the matter?
Mother's unwell.
You should go to her then.
What about you and Arya?
We'll be fine.
We'll stay here till you get back.
Please go.
You're leaving again?
I won't let you go.
Prince Arya, a matter of two days.
I'll return soon.
You did not even finish the story.
- Where were we?
Yes... the three monsters died.
The prince killed them all.
The Princess's anger turned to love.
The prince asked for
her hand in marriage.
She said yes, right?
Instantly.
Then?
Then the prince left.
Where to?
To his mother who was ill.
This is a sad story.
No way. The prince will return with
hundreds of horses and elephants...
...to take his princess away.
Tell the prince to return soon.
His princess will be waiting.
The prince will come back
with hundreds of horses and elephants.
You take care of Kaurwaki.
Greetings, Prince.
Where is Mother?
- Come inside.
You lie to me and then want
God's forgiveness?
Had I not lied how would I see my son?
Seen me? Now I must leave.
Someone is waiting for me.
Who?
Someone.
As lovely as a lotus,
a heavenly creature.
She is so beautiful.
Anyone who sees her...
Will become a poet?
No... a lover.
You forget the white hair.
White hair?
She is someone else but
you'll always be my first love.
Mere words. Who is she?
Kaurwaki.
- Kaurwaki? What of her family?
All here. You, Vitasoka, me.
We are her family.
Mother, I have married her.
- Married?
Why didn’t you bring her?
- Not like this.
When I do, Magadha will welcome her
ceremoniously.
The streets will be lit with lamps,
decorated with flowers.
Then I will tell her who I am.
- You've not told her yet?
I told a lovely white-haired lady
that I won't tell anyone.
Silly.
Take the blessings of the King.
Praise the lord.
General, the rumor all over Kalinga
is that Prince Arya has been killed.
The senate has decided to place
someone else on the throne.
I know that's why it's important
that I go to Kalinga.
It's unsafe for Arya to go there now.
Princess, give me your anklet...
Arya, your necklace.
No one should know
they are hiding here.
Don't worry, General.
I will guard them with my life.
He's served the royal family for years.
You'll be safe here.
Don't go anywhere until my return.
Yes... now I have to listen
to the General's orders.
Greetings, Susima.
Greetings.
Where were you all these days?
Just wandering around.
Tomorrow morning,
in front of everyone.
I was just scaring you.
I don't want to fight.
Susima, I don't want
the throne or the crown.
I don't want anything.
Have you ever loved someone?
Love?
- No? You should.
Brother, he is trying to trick us again.
So, you've returned?
You remembered Magadha?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I wanted to...
A rebellion is threatened in Ujjaini.
Go there.
Any problem?
No, Your Majesty.
Are you missing Pawan?
- Yes.
He said that should I think of him
I should call his name out loud.
Then, he'll appear.
Should I call him?
You call out as well.
Prince...
I must go.
- His highness has ordered...
Don't worry. You go to Ujjaini.
I will meet you there.
Despite the talk,
I was sure you were all safe.
Who would want to kill Prince Arya?
At first I suspected you.
And I suspected you.
At times like this friends
suspect one another.
Bring Prince Arya here at the earliest.
I cannot contain the senate any longer.
You are right.
Don't go alone, General.
I need no one.
- You do.
