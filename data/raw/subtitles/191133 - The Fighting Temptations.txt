Church bells tolling

That's why I’m makin'

To meet
He-e-e-ey
The Lord
A woman came up to me one day...
Thanks, Darrin.
You're welcome.
She said I’m not ready...
I’m not ready to give up
my wicked ways...
You want to be
my girlfriend?
Sorry, but I want to marry
Michael Jackson.
Darrin, Lilly,

...he gives me a hard time
Yeah, yeah
I told that woman
I told that woman how

That stone, that
Flew down the mountain
I’m looking for that stone

Oh, alleluia
I’m looking for that stone,
yes, I am
Flew down the mountain
And it's coming

-Yes, it is

We're near it,

Oh, yeah, and the Lord

At any time

-Coming all down
-To redeem a dying world
-To redeem...
Yes, it is
...a dying world
-A dying world.
-World!
Bless you.
Oh, my goodness,
there she goes again.
Wouldn't be a normal Sunday
if Faye didn't get
slain in the spirit.
Uh-huh.
Oh, Maryann.
Pastor.
This boy is growing like a weed.
You must be feeding
him fertilizer.
And his teachers say
he's the smartest in his class.
There she is.
Hold her, Reverend.
The nerve.
Standing in the house of God
and all the while
singing the devil's music.
Paulina, what's this all about?
I found this down
at Robinson's store.
It's Maryann,
singing that R&B sex music.
Oh. Oh, uh, uh,
uh, Maryann. Maryann!
What you got to say
about all this?
I finally got my chance
to become a singer.
I didn't think
anything was wrong.
Reverend, the church bylaws
clearly state
that no member shall partake
of fornication,
Amen.
Gambling.
Amen.
And drinking, which
is all going on down
at that juke joint
where she sings.
Just take a look at this.
“Do it to me again.”
My, my, my, my, my.
Now, we all know
what “it” means.
Paulina.
I’m surprised you'd
even remember what “it” is.
and besides,
what were you doing
down at the record store
looking through
“the devil's music”?
I got the Lord on my
side with this one.
Paulina, you need to hush.
Tell her, honey.
Because this girl
ain't doing nothing
to hurt nobody.
Amen, sister Sally.
Need I remind you
of the church motto?
Tell her, sister!
“Beware of brief delight
and lasting shame.”
That must be them kids
on that organ again.
I'm-I'm gonna go.
Stop stalling, Paul.
You know the church rules.
-You're supposed to handle this.
-Paulina,
I’m the pastor here.
Leave it to me, please?
You do your job, boy,
or I’m going to go and get Mama.
Now, you know you're supposed
to call me “reverend”
around here.
I’m going to handle this
my way, okay?
Now, Maryann.
It’s like this.
It’s like she says.
You stop singing
that secular music,
or you're going to have
to leave the choir.
I’m sorry.
It’s your pick.
Make up your mind, child.
Think about what
you're doing, sister.
Wave good-bye to Aunt Sally.
Darrin, here's that
market research you wanted,
and I know you're real busy,
but there's something
you should know.
Yes... I’m going
to blow them away.
I’m a player.
I’m in the zone.
Corner office, huge window.
Take care of these
credit card bills for me.
All right.
Use this one
to pay off this one, okay?
-Okay.
-And, uh, do a balance transfer
from-- oh, excuse me--
from here to here
for that one, all right,
and cover this one
with that one.
So, what were you
trying to say earlier?
There's a private investigator
over there looking for you.
Why?
Who's trying to find me?
I’m double checking--
is Darrin Hill around?
What did he say?
Did you tell him anything?
Does he know what I look like?
No. Chill.
I told him you're not in,
-so he's leaving a message.
-Uh, tell him I’m out of town.
I did.
Good.
Time to climb
the corporate ladder.
By our projections,
this plan will increase
the market shares
of Lincoln & Gerald Liquors
by a whopping eight percent
in as little as two years.
We were hoping to see
faster growth.
We can give them
double digit growth.
As I said, it is
the company position that
eight percent growth should be
the goal.
-Now...
-If there's a different opinion
that'll lead to better growth,
we want to hear it.
Now let me ask you
which demographic consumes
the most malt liquor?
Go ahead, you can say it.
Black people.
There you go.
Very good.
However, I noticed
in your company report
that you don't have
a malt liquor division.
I noticed that, too.
I propose
a new ad campaign
for a malt liquor division
that maximizes exposure
in the African-American market.
Place positive images
of your product
in areas
where black people live.
By tapping into
the buying power
of this consumer base,
you'll pass single-digit growth
faster than a pro athlete
can get his criminal charges
dropped.
That, my friends,
is not thinking outside the box.
That's realizing
there is no box.
Now, those are the kind of ideas
we hired this company for.
Where have you been hiding
this one, Fairchild?
He's one
of our junior executives.
This man needs to be
on the team.
I mean, he was a junior
executive... before today.
Congratulations.
You've just been promoted.
Thank you, sir.
Where'd you learn
that kind of thinking?
-Yale.
-Oh, I’m a Princeton man myself,
but I see we let one get away.
Okay, well, we better leave
and let them get started
on this interesting idea.
Well, I guess I’ll be giving you
a corner office with a view.
Thank you, sir.
Cigar?
Well, this is France's finest.
I first encountered it
growing up in Monte Carlo.
Please, you're a New York boy
if I ever saw one.
No, I lived there
until I was 1 7.
Wow, I have never met a brother
who grew up in Europe before.
Actually, I was born
in South America.
Where?
Home Video.
That's in Peru, right?
Venezuela.
My father was in oil.
You sound so American.
Well, I went to prep school
here... at Andover.
Money was no object.
-Cool.
-Mr. Hill,
I’m afraid your credit card
has been declined.
R-Right, that was, uh,
not activated yet.
Okay. Uh... try this one.
Darrin, Mr. Fairchild
wants to see you
first thing in the morning.
Great.
Great, great, great.
As you can see,
there is nothing
in my refrigerator but water,
water and wine.
This is the dining room.
We don't spend a lot of time
in here so it looks
very nice and well-set.
Like this chandelier--
it's not just
a normal chandelier.
It’s just kind of funky and fun.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Darrin.
What I have to say
is very difficult.
We have a, uh... situation.
A situation that involves
deception,
a lack of candor,
and an unbridled passion
to get what one wants
at any cost.
I think you know
what I’m referring to.
Of course, sir, company policy.
No, no, no...
well, yes, of course it is,
but in this case
it's something more personal.
Darrin, you're fired.
Fired?
But why?
A representative
of Lincoln & Gerald
has an annoying habit
of checking up on things.
It seems that you were
thrown out of Yale
when it was discovered
you faked your high school
diploma from Andover.
How long did you think
it would take
before your deception
caught up with you?
But, sir,
I’ve been doing such good work.
Mr. Hill,
we cannot be represented
by people who tell lies.
We're in advertising.
You obtained this job
under false pretenses,
and now you've caused the firm
great embarrassment
in front of important clients.
I’m sorry.
I have to let you go.
You're good, you're smart,
but you broke
the Eleventh Commandment--
“Thou shalt not get caught.”
Now...
Sir, please,
you're making a big mistake.
I’m here for you.
I’m smart, I’m ambitious...
Have your things
out of here in half an hour.
I’m disappointed in you.
I expected more
from a congressman's son.
Darrin Hill?
Yes.
You've been a tough one
to track down, Mr. Hill.
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,
but this is for you.
What is it? A subpoena?
Summons?
Ploy to distract me
while you repo my stuff?
Sure, those are fun,
but no.
Oh, my Aunt Sally died.
“We request your presence
at the funeral
and reading of the will.”
Oh...
The funeral is tomorrow.
Maybe you should
ask your boss
for some time off.
You know you just cut
a brother, right?
Oh.
Hurts when you do that, man.
Sorry.
Come on, baby.
Make me happy.
Cash advance.
Be a winner.
Be a winner.
Whoo-hoo!
Thank you, Bank of Piscataway.
Heaven only knows
How much I love you, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
oh, oh, oh
Heaven's in your eyes...
Baby, please
Please don't take
your love from me
I am yours forevermore
Till eternity
Silently
Listen to the words
I say
Now I’m not talking
just for play
Listen to me, please...
I told you kids ain't got
no business playing
a man's game.
Funny, that's the same thing
someone told me...
oh...
two hours ago.
Don't you know
Don't you know,
don't you know
Love is all I need
'Cause I love you
and I need you
Yes, I want you,
gotta have you
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
Spent my whole life
On the way
to someplace else
Thinking right around
the bend
I might find myself
But the search goes on
I won't quit
till I get home.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I get something
to eat around here?
Reed?
Coming right up.
Better make that to go.
I need a taxi.
Reed's only got two hands.
Wait until he fixes
your dinner.
Right.
No signal.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh!
You must be Darrin.
Damn, word, get low.
What's up?
Darrin, I’m Lucius, man,
I’m your welcome committee.
Oh, well,
how'd you know I was here?
Man, word travels
fast, and Aunt Sally
always bragged she had a
successful nephew from New York.
Let me get your stuff, man.
Really?
Come on.
Oh.
Monte Carlo didn't change, man.
It used to be a one-horse town.
What, did the horse die?
No, see, see, now you'll see,
you'll see, you'll see.
We got everything to offer
that a big city does.
Oh.
I’m happy to have another
player in town, man.
I’ve got tired of
holding this down solo.
Hey, man, reach over there
and pull this handle
from the inside.
It only open from the inside.
Okay.
-Appreciate that.
-Sure.
So you came by train.
That's cool.
I was trying to meet the bus.
Going to the Canaan Inn.
Okay, that-that Canaan Inn,
that's straight down this road
about five minutes.
Oh. Whoa.
Your door won't open,
and mine won't stay shut.
But it opens.
Oh.
Yes, it opens.
The next hour of programming
is brought to you by
Mitchell's Funeral Home,
where the caskets are so nice,
you'll wish you were dead.
Now for the news.
Like to give a shout out
to Darrin Hill,
in town for Sally's funeral.
Welcome home, little Darrin.
That's news?
I’ll be right back
with traffic.
There is no traffic.
There is no traffic.
This is easy.
I could do this job.
Oh, I wonder what
the temperature is.
The temperature is 85.
Thanks.
Boy, you done got up there
in New York and got soft,
and this ain't nothing compared
to July and August.
That's when you can take an egg
and just fry it on the sidewalk.
Well, you can keep that.
After the funeral, I’m going
straight back to New York City,
where we don't have eggs frying
on the sidewalk.
Why? Because it's cold?
No, because it's civilization.
There's too much urine
on the sidewalk.
See, boy, see, you don't
know what you're missing.
Now I’m telling you,
now the hotter
it get down here,
the less and less
the honeys start wearing.
You know, they got to
let that booty bo...
...got to let
that booty breathe.
Now I’m telling you,
I know you got all your
Naomo Campbos
and your Holle Berrys,
and your Teary-Eyed Banks,
all them models
and junk up there,
but for the booty, you
got to come down south.
We booty experts.
Booty-ologists.
Booty is in the eye
of the beholder.
No, booty gonna be in my hand.
Check it out now, you see,
now your Louisiana booty,
it gets its renowned buoyancy
from its heavy seafood diet,
while your Alabama booty,
it's characterized
by its density.
You're talking
about a quarter-bouncing ping.
And as for your
Mississippi booty,
it's been an ongoing debate,
but consensus say that the
Indian-genetic contribution
gives us its beautiful tone.
And as for your
Georgia booty,
it's been known for ages
that the Georgia sun
bakes and seals
all the booty juices
into a slow roast.
I see I’m dealing
with a connoisseur.
Oh yeah, for sure.
A booty connoisseur.
Oh. Who's that?
Lilly. Please, hurry up.
That's Lilly.
Forget all of that booty stuff.
She's in a spectrum
of fine as the energy
is so potent, she got
a class-action suit
against her right now
for reckless endangerment, man.
Sounds like
a special kind of woman.
Well, holler at me
later on tonight.
I’ll hook you up with her.
This is where you're staying.
I thought they were
putting me up in a hotel.
This looks like a house.
It’s a boarding house.
It’s the only place
that has room.
The prison officer's
convention is in town.
Hey, Jimmy B.
Hey, what up, Smooth L?
His grandmother
owns the place.
You Darrin?
Yes.
You're late.
Yo, come on, everybody
is already at the funeral.
-Um... uh...
-Get in.
Mama catch me put a whuppin'
to my backside
And even as a crack fiend...
Hey, man, now, come on, look.
That's inappropriate
music for this occasion.
Show some respect.
This man's auntie is
about to be maggot food.
At any moment, the funeral
is beginning
of Sally Walker.
Let us have a moment of silence
to pay our respect.
Uh, uh, sorry 'bout that.
I guess I was celebrating
her life
a little late, uh,
into the night.
Oh, Simon. Sarah,
how are y'all doing today?
This is Aunt Sally's nephew,
Darrin.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry about your aunt.
Oh, yes, we all
loved Miss Sally.
Why, she was little
Nicholas' godmother.
Hey, little man.
You know I’m your daddy, right?
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.
I’m in the friggin'
twilight zone.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Oh, Sally!
Why'd it have to be her?
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.
Good Lord, Faye!
Couldn't you find someplace else
to be slain in the spirit?
Grandma, get up.
She's your grandma?
-Yeah.
-Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.
They've got a lot of nerve
showing their faces
in the House of God.
I’m glad my dear departed
husband James
isn't here to witness
this abomination.
You can't keep people
from a funeral, Paulina.
Besides, they all love Sally.
They're a bunch of heathens.
I don't even know why she cared.
Move down.
Brothers and sisters,
we are gathered here today
to pay tribute
to a great woman...
Yeah!
...Sally Walker.
And we will now be blessed
with a selection from the choir
and their lead singer,
Reverend Shirley Caesar.
Oh...
I got a signal. It’s a miracle.
Son, if that ain't Jesus
calling, shut it off.
Sorry. Go on.
l, uh... l...
cell phone's been out of range.
Has Mr. Fairchild
changed his mind?
l...
What?!
They've already started
repossessing your stuff.
Not my TV!
Nothing can replace Aunt Sally!
Not my TV, not my Bose
home theater system...
Yeah, let it out, son,
let it out.
Mm, yeah. Mm.
Keep stalling the creditors,
I’ll call you back.
It’s all right.
Gonna be all right, man.
The church is in mourning
Mourning
Glory to God
The church is in mourning
Mourning
Oh, yes, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
The church is in
Mourning
Mourning
Good God almighty
Another soldier
A true born soldier
Has gone...
Gone home
Hallelujah!
Well, we're here today
For the home-going
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
And the celebration
of a wonderful woman
Aunt Sally
Everybody loved Aunt Sally
She took the young people
And carried them under her wings
And she cared for the elderly
I just want to say, listen
We might not have this chance
Sleep on, Aunt Sally
Sleep on, Aunt Sally
And take your rest
We loved you, Aunt Sally
But God loves you best
lf you see my mother there
Tell my mama I’m on my way
I’m on my way
Our hearts are in mourning
Mourning
Glory to God
Yes, to lift our hearts
in mourning
Mourning
Good God almighty
Good God almighty
Yes, to lift our hearts
in mourning
Soldier
Another soldier
A true born soldier
A Holy Ghost soldier
A heaven-bound soldier
Has...
Gone
Gone, gone

Gone on home
Gone home
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Yeah...
Hallelujah!
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah...
Let the church say amen.
Amen!
Let the church say amen.
Amen!
-Yes, Lord...
-Amen.
Yes, Lord!
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, well, well.
At this time,
we'd like to give
some of Sally's
family and loved ones
an opportunity
to come up here
and say how much
she meant to them.
And it's only fitting
to start with the person
that came the farthest way
to be here.
That's her great-nephew, Darrin.
All right, Darrin, all right.
Oh, yeah, brother Darrin.
Yes, my brother.
Come on.
Oh, yeah. Amen.
Hi.
Many of you don't remember me.
The one that had the phone.
Yeah. But before that,
I was Aunt Sally's
favorite nephew.
Hmm!
I thought we'd see forever,
but forever's gone away.
And it's so hard
to say good-bye
to yesterday.
Boyz II Men.
I got one amen.
can I get another?
Amen.
My mom passed away
a few years ago
in a hit-and-run accident
when I was still a teenager,
and it's the talks
I had with her
I cherish more than anything.
I remember her telling me...
that it was Aunt Sally
who took us in
when I was just a baby,
after my father died in Vietnam.
I’ll always love her for that.
Your mama dead, too?
He just said it.
Young man,
I’m so glad that you came
for your aunt's funeral.
Yeah.
She was always telling us
how well you were doing
up in New York.
With your important job.
What was it?
What was what?
Your job.
It’s funny, she never mentioned
what it was.
Boy, I haven't seen you
since you were knee-high
to a grasshopper.
Reverend, um, have you seen
this very pretty lady--
I think her name is Lilly?
She ain't no lady.
Oh, now, Mother Cooley.
All sinners are welcome
in the house of the Lord.
Sinner? She's a sinner?
What kind of sinner?
Unrepentant.
Really.
Well, Darrin, I just come
to offer you my condolences
and to just let you know
that to be absent from the body
is to be present with the Lord.
You got to understand
that she's in
a far better place, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
You know, I got to tell you,
you and that choir--
boy, you're pretty good.
Pretty good? Huh.
And to my neighbor
and best friend, Faye,
I leave all my favorite recipes.
Thank you, Sally.
Now, Faye, depending
on what I die from,
you might want to divide
the Crisco measurements by half.
Don't change
that Chicken Supreme.
And to Paulina Pritchett,
I leave my collection
of church hats
that she always
complimented me on.
She should really enjoy
wearing them,
unless, of course, she was lying
to me all those years
but criticizing my taste
behind my back.
I’ll wear them every Sunday.
And now,
for my only surviving relative,
my great-nephew, Darrin.
To Darrin, I leave the box
containing the letters
his mother sent me
after they left Monte Carlo.
I also pass on to him
the charge of returning
to Monte Carlo
to continue the family tradition
of... directing
the Beulah Baptist Church Choir.
-No!
-No.
l-It’s her dying wish.
I was next in line
to get the choir.
I been waiting years
for Sally to die.
God rest her soul.
Listen, lady, you can have it.
I’m not staying, let alone
leading some small-town choir.
Good.
O-On the condition that Darrin
gets the choir accepted
into the annual Gospel Explosion
in Columbus,
and performs there,
I also leave him
my entire stock
in Georgia Telecom,
currently worth $150,000.
I was just kidding
about that small-town stuff.
And the church bus.
How much that worth?
No way! Mm-mmm!
I don't care
what Sally's dying wish was.
We all know she was losing it
these last few years.
Besides, Paul,
it's your church,
and you have final say
over who leads
the choir.
It’s in the bylaws.
Well, I guess
that would seem kind of odd
to have someone
with no musical experience
leading the choir.
No, no, I have plenty
of musical experience.
Now, you all
don't know this,
and I didn't tell
anyone, but, um...
I’m a music producer.
Oh.
Yeah, that's what
I do for a living.
Ooh, looks like Sally
might have been onto something.
W-W-W-What kind
of producing have you done?
Well, I’ve worked with, uh...
P. Diddy.
Dre, Dark Child--
all of them.
-Who that?
-That's the gangsta stuff
that's polluting
my grandson's mind.
I was the one that put an end
to that whole East Coast
versus West Coast thing.
Yeah, I just sat them all down
and made them watch Roots.
I think
I read about that.
So, what
is this Gospel Explosion?
Oh, it's the annual event
where choirs
from all over the southeast
come to Columbus, Georgia,
to compete for the best
gospel performance
and a $10,000 cash prize.
Yeah, a prize that could pay
for some much-needed
church repairs...
...if a certain musical producer
would bring it home, yes?
Paul Lewis, have you lost
your natural mind?
I wish Mama was alive
to see how you turn
on family like this.
Sally was as close to family
as anybody can get,
and I intend
on honoring her dying wish.
Now, Darrin,
the choir is yours.
You have six weeks
until the Gospel Explosion.
Whatever you need,
we're at your disposal.
But you're going to have to talk
to the church treasurer
about logistics.
Let me guess.
You're the treasurer.
Yes. Everything you need
is at my disposal.
Great.
Take it easy.
Oh, oh, uh, Paulina,
can I get a ride
back to my room?
Oh, Darrin.
Since you're going to be here
for longer than I thought,
let me give you
the extended stay rates.
Great.
There's an extra charge
of $1 .50 for every
bar of soap you use,
from now on,
$2.00
for any clean towel you require,
and $1 .00 a minute
for all calls made.
You get one
free 9-1-1 call.
I suggest you use it wisely.
Air conditioning?
You're charging me
for air conditioning?
It gets 100 degrees at night.
What is that?
It’s a Monte Cristo.
It’s a cigar.
Obviously.
Cuban?
Of course.
Cool.
Hey!
That-That cost me $20.
This is a no-smoking house.
It’s a no-smoking,
no drinking, no fornicating,
no point of living at all house.
Why are we here?
You'll see.
A little Southern delight.
Now the honeys in here,
they make them girls in Atlanta
look like somebody hit them in
the face with a sack of nickels.
And I don't mean that
in a sexy way.
There she is.
You're on your own.
I see somebody
that owes me some money.
Hey man, don't run away from me.
Man, I told you
I was going to get...
-Ooh, hi, sexy.
-Hey, baby.
Oh...
You give me fever...
Fever... oh...
Oh...
You give me fever
Fever in the morning
Fever when
it's late at night
You give me fever
Fever
Fever when you kiss me
Fever when
you hold me tight
You give me fever
Fever
Fever when you're with me
Fever when you love...
He's so sweet
He's so good to me
He's so intelligent
He's so confident
Baby, so damn sexy
Baby, put the fever on me
Give me a fever... oh...
Never know how much I love you
Never know
how much I care
When you put
your arms around me
I get the fever
that's so hard to bear
You give me fever
Fever
When you kiss me
And fever when
you hold me tight
You give me fever
Fever
 In the morning
And fever
all through the night
Baby's so damn sexy
But baby
put the fever on me, uh-uh
Baby knows just what to do
Got me boiling past 102
Give me a fever
Ooh...
Everybody's got a fever
That is something
you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
And Juliet felt the same
When he puts
his arms around her
He said, “Julie, baby,
you're my flame”
Give me fever
When we kisseth
Fever with a flame in you
Fever... I’m on fire
Fever, yeah,
I burn and soothe
Now that you listened
to my story
Here's a point
that I have made
Chicks were born
to give you fever
Being Fahrenheit
or Centigrade
They give you fever
When you kiss them
And fever
if you live and learn
Fever, until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn...
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to...
Burn...
Fever.
Whoo!
Tea with honey.
Here you go, Lilly.
Thank you.
You really know how
to connect with your audience.
That was hot.
It’s a part of my act.
I pick out the guy
who's drooling the most,
and I make him sweat.
Well, it worked.
Can I buy you a real drink?
I’m Darrin.
You really don't remember me?
That Lilly?
You kept asking me
to be your girlfriend.
And you kept saying no.
Yeah, I was determined to be
Mrs. Michael Jackson.
And how's that going?
Ah, turns out
I’m not his type.
I can't believe you
remember that stuff.
I left town when you
were what, five?
Four.
Man, we heard about you
all the time.
Every week in choir rehearsal,
Sally would tell
us poor country folk
how well you
and your mama were
doing in slick city.
She was very special
to all of us.
Yeah.
When I talked to her
on the phone,
just before she passed,
she kept saying that
she wanted me to come back
and be with her
friends, like you.
You spoke with Sally that day?
Oh, yeah.
She went on and on.
I suppose she hung up
the phone and, uh...
And her dying wish
was for us to hook up?
God love her.
Sally was in a coma
two weeks before she died.
That's right.
It was...
must have been a couple
of weeks ago...
Right.
Anyway, I’m back
amongst all you
wonderful people
who need consoling
as much as I do.
How long are you in town?
Just tonight.
Hey, how about being
my girlfriend,
for old times' sake?
I’ve got a man.
Oh.
Dean is big and strong
and has a real big
jealous streak.
Sometimes he watches
from the back.
Excuse me,
I got a show to do.
Uh, okay.
Hey, knock 'em dead.
Your act is terrific.
Yours needs a lot of work.
I know I missed your call, Rosa,
but this is the only place
I get a signal.
More charges came in,
more late fees.
You're up to 44 grand now.
Okay, listen, I just came
into some money, all right?
And I’ll be able to take care of
everything in just a few weeks.
Just, uh, make sure they
don't know where to find me.
I’ll do my best.
You're a doll.
Kick ass.
Sorry.
Okay, when
everyone gets here,
we'll begin rehearsals.
I was thinking
we should just
stick to that number
you did at the funeral.
Should be good enough to get
into any gospel competition.
That was Shirley Caesar, fool.
She hasn't gone
to this church for years,
but since she loved Sally,
we let her and her choir
sing at the funeral.
She's gone?
She's gone.
Well, where's our choir?
You're looking at it.
This is it?
Six measly people.
Actually just five.
Um, I’m just here 'cause
my wife's family's in town.
They're staying at my house.
Too late.
You're in the choir now.
Well, actually there
are two or three others.
Yeah, but they never show up.
Man, this is busted.
Why do I have to be here?
Oh, Brother Darrin?
When are you going to get us
our first record contract?
I want to hurry up
and get a Benz.
Hey, I didn't know we
were going to be famous.
You know what?
Definitely count me in now.
Um... let's do, uh...
“Amazing Grace.”
Amaze...
Maze...
Amaze...
Ah-amaze...
...zing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop, please.
Okay, okay, okay,
let's not panic.
Um...
I’m open to suggestion.
Hey, when you get us
that record deal,
and they do one of those
VH1 Behind the Musics on us,
I think it's best
if we don't talk about
me trying to leave the group.
You know?
They'll just make it look ugly.
Everything I do
is just for you
Counting every second
till we rendezvous
You want
to rendezvous
Ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Oh, and I want to give it
to you, baby
Give it to me, baby
I want to give it to you
Oh, give it to me, baby
Hey...
'Cause everything I do
is just for you
'Cause everything
I do is just for you
All for you
Come on, give me your love.
Uh, hello, there.
I just had
to see you again.
Aren't you supposed
to be gone?
Yes, but, uh,
I was feeling bad
about our little
misunderstanding last night.
No misunderstanding,
just using Aunt Sally's memory
to hit on me.
-That's low.
-Come on.
Can I at least
buy you a drink?
Is that Dean?
No.
Okay, you can buy me a drink.
Oh, I’m sure you heard
-about Aunt Sally's will.
-No.
It seems she wants me
to take care of
the choir down at Beulah.
Why did she put you
in charge of it?
I’m sorry,
that came out wrong.
Oh, no, no, no.
It’s okay,
it was a shock to me, too.
Yeah, it's a big job.
That's why I’ve cleared my
schedule for the next six weeks,
put some business deals on hold,
so that I can focus
on getting the choir
into the Gospel Explosion.
No.
I been there and done that.
Look, if it's Paulina
you're worried about,
I’ll take care of Paulina.
I’d love to see that one.
I’m the choir director now.
Yeah, for six weeks.
Listen, if she starts getting
all Christian on you...
-Christian?
-Yeah.
She is not a Christian.
My mama said hollering
in the church
don't make you
any more of a Christian
than standing in the garage
makes you a Cadillac.
No, man, I can't let
those hypocrites
look down their noses at me
just because l...
Sing sexy songs for a living.
Exactly.
And just because l...
Dress like that.
What's wrong with
the way I dress?
Oh, no, no, I’m just
finishing your sentence.
I was going to say
because l...
Cheat on your boyfriend
with hot choir directors
from New York City?
Stop...
-Finishing your sentences?
-Look.
I know your kind.
You came here last night
'cause you wanted something.
You came back again tonight
'cause you want something else,
and tomorrow you're going
to want something else.
I can smell when a man
is trying to use me,
and mister, you stink.
Okay, is that how
you feel about it?
Fine.
This town is full of singers.
I don't need you anyway.
And remember, everybody,
Handy's Funeral Home
offers limousines
for all occasions.
Why not get in one
while you're still living?
Well, now that we done
paid the bills...
Ladies and gentlemen,
sitting directly
across from me,
I have Mr. Darrin Hill
all the way from New York City.
So Darrin,
tell the good people
of Monte Carlo
what brings you
down here with us?
I’m responsible
for rebuilding the choir
down at Beulah Baptist Church.
 In fact, I’m holding auditions
tomorrow morning,
and anyone with any musical
ability can come by.
As long as they are,
as we say at Beulah,
fully committed to God's work.
Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
Whoa!
Forgiving my sins
Baptized in the water
Freed by the Holy Ghost
Washed in the blood
of the lamb
Forgiving my sins
Baptized in the water
Freed by the Holy Ghost
Washed in the blood
of the lamb
God's going
to move this place
God's going to move
this place
God's going to turn the world
upside down
Auditions for the Beulah Baptist
Church Choir are still open.
Applicants need not be fully
committed to God's work,
but shouldn't be against it.
I’m the hottest shit in
New York since Air Force Ones
And from the borough that
brought you Chris and Pun
Yeah, a lot of cats rhyme,
but not like some
I make it hard, like breathing
with a slug in your lung
Blow, blow, now you got
to deal with me
Isn't she lovely?
Isn’t she wonderful?
Isn’t she precious?
Isn’t she precious?
Just one minute old
You got to be kidding me!
I never thought
true love would bring
One that's has lovely as she
But isn't she lovely?
Made from love.
News update.
Auditions for the Beulah
Baptist Church Choir,
atheists may now apply.
Oh, thanks for coming, Lucius.
No problem.
Where to?
Oh, I just need to print
up some more fliers.
Paulina won't let me use
Jimmy B's printer anymore.
She says it's running
up her light bill.
Oh, well, you know
old folks in the south
believe some crazy stuff.
Tell me about it.
When it's storming,
she doesn't even
use the electricity.
You don't play with God.
Right.
You don't sing, do you, Lucius?
Do I sing? Y-Yeah.
They say I sound like
a black Al Jarreau.
Great, you're in the choir.
Oh, whoa, wait a minute.
What'd you say?
Pump your brakes.
I’m not planning on
joining the church
until I have sown my wild oats.
Then I’m going to get me
a young virgin and settle down.
Say no more.
Besides...
word's out.
Paulina's bad enough,
you done pissed her off.
Don't nobody want
to be a part
of that mix
made in hell.
Now the only way
I can join is...
is if... is if you paying.
How about the prize money?
50/50?
Done deal, 50/50.
Hello, are you Joseph?
Yeah.
Can I line you up, son?
Actually I just came by
to post some fliers
for my choir auditions,
if that's okay.
Sure.
Seeing how you're new
in these parts,
it's going to be kind of hard
for you
to attract people.
Most folks around here,
they don't trust an outsider.
It was years
before I told anyone
I’m not from Mississippi.
I’ve got a guy here
who needs his ears lowered.
Hey, Lilly.
Dean, my man.
Come on,
I’ll get the seat.
That's Dean?
He's big, strong and jealous,
so watch yourself.
So I see you done met
the big-time music producer
from New York, huh?
Music producer?
Lilly has the best
voice in town.
I know.
You don't have to wait with me.
No one else's mom
waits for them.
He'll be fine.
Okay, I’m going to be
next door, all right?
Dean, don't talk to strangers.
Yo, big man.
You want us to sing you
a song like we did last time?
Yes, please.
It'll cost you.
I’ll give you
a thousand money.
Deal.
Ooh...
When I was a little boy
When I was just a boy
And the devil
would call my name
When I was just a boy
I’d say “Now who do,
Who do you think
you're fooling?”
-When I was just a boy
-I’m a consecrated boy
When I was just a boy
I’m a singer in a Sunday choir
Oh, my mama loves me
She loves me
She get down on her knees
and hug me
Oh, she loves me like a rock
She rocks me
like the rock of ages
And loves me
She love me, love me,
love me, love me
When I was grown
to be a man
Grown to be a man
And the devil would
call my name
Grown to be a man
I’d say “Now who do,
Who do you think
you're fooling?”
-Grown to be a man
-I’m a consummated man
Grown to be a man
I can snatch a little purity
Oh, my mama loves me,
she loves me
She get down on her knees
and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock.
Lilly.
You know, at first I was
afraid you'd follow me here,
but I actually feel a lot safer
knowing you're not
in the same room with my son.
And to answer
your next question, no...
You're not married.
Don't finish my sentences.
That's why you're
a sinner.
Stay far away from me.
No, no...
No, I’m saying, that's no
reason to treat you badly.
I mean, how dare they?
It’s not your fault.
Well, it's 50% your fault
because it takes
two people to...
Well, you know what I mean.
No.
I’m saying it's a pity
that you don't have
a complete family,
but it's still no reason...
Oh, don't talk to me
about family,
Mr. Didn't Call Aunt Sally
For 20 Years.
Hi.
Hi.
I’m sorry.
I’m starting to see how
tough things are for you.
Oh, yes.
Boo-hoo for the poor,
black mother
stuck in her hometown
without a man.
Whatever shall I do?
I didn't mean it that way.
Excuse me, Lilly, I’m sorry,
but your card
is maxed out again.
I forgot to put
my paycheck in.
Thank you.
-Excuse me.
-Hmm-mm.
Hey, try this one.
Sorry, Dr. Hill,
yours is declined, too.
Dr. Hill? You a doctor?
No, that's just my music name.
You know, like Dr. John,
Dr. Dre.
Try this one.
Well, that's cleared.
Of course.
Sign here.
Thank you.
That was really nice.
You didn't
have to do that.
That's what I’m saying,
I’m a nice guy.
I don't know
what the problem is.
I usually get along better
with beautiful women.
Okay, I’ll...
I’ll give you a check
tomorrow, first thing.
Oh, um, cash.
Cash.
Reverend.
Oh... Darrin.
Thanks for meeting me here.
Uh, how's it going
with the choir?
Well, I’m still having trouble
recruiting the members.
Son, it's at times like these
I suggest listening
to God's voice.
Sorry, Rev, I’m not
into the spooky stuff.
Oh, just open it up.
And these people can sing?
Oh, yes.
Please don't tell my sister.
Hello, everyone.
I’d like you to welcome
the new members of our choir.
So when is this competition?
 In a few weeks.
And our new organist.
You touch my keyboard
and I kick your
drunk 'bama ass.
Oh, oh, wait, Homer.
Now, if we stand any chance
of getting into
the Gospel Explosion,
we could use
all the help we can get.
Shoot.
Bringing all these drunks
up into the church
with hats on
and drunks and everything.
Okay, everyone, please.
Okay, good.
Good. Uh...
I’d like to...
I’d like to try a new song.
Um... uh...
Tasha?
Can you, uh, get rid
of the gum, please?
Sure.
Okay.
That was nasty.
Uh... “Swing Low,
Sweet Chariot.”
Oh, ah, uh, Homer, please.
Scooter.
Swing low
Sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me
home...
Wait-wait-wait,
wait, wait, stop, stop.
Stop, wait, um...
this is not working.
Um...
You need to pick
a lead singer.
You'd know that if you knew what
you were doing.
Oh, oh, could-could I maybe try?
Bessie...
would you, uh, like to try?
No.
My dear departed
husband James said
that when I sing, it
made him think of heaven.
Probably meant he wanted
to blow his brains out.
Paulina,
you've sung lead
-before?
-I have,
and it gave me great joy.
Oh, good. Then it'll hurt
that much more
when I find someone else.
Be careful, Dean, baby,
don't hurt yourself.
Oh, let the boy be.
He's already wearing
more protection
then they gave me
when I fought in the war.
Oh!
-Hey.
-Hey.
You're the pain in the butt
from the barbershop.
He must have heard
that somewhere.
Hi, there, young man.
I’m Lilly's grandfather.
Hello, sir.
I’ve been waiting
for a nice, strong young man
to come and whisk Lilly away.
Somebody did that already,
remember?
She shouldn't be wasting
the next 25 years of her life
taking care of no old man.
No, she should go off
and have a life of her own.
Cool!
Sammy Sosa.
What do you say?
He said cool.
Dean?
Thank you.
Look, Granddaddy.
-I got Sammy Sosa.
-Oh, okay.
So have you changed
your mind about the choir?
Why should l,
'cause you gave Dean a toy?
No. Yes?
Why is this so important to you?
Because it's what
my Aunt Sally wanted me to do.
Every time I pack my bags
to leave,
I get that image
of her helping my Mom out
when I was little...
and because
it was her last wish
to get into the Explosion,
and because...
And because
you're getting $150,000.
I thought I’d finish
your sentence for you.
That is the truth, right?
Yeah. Yes.
Thanks for being honest,
but I can't.
What?
You mean, I just told the truth
for nothing?
Thank you for the loan
yesterday.
I know you want cash.
You know, this truth stuff
is highly overrated.
I don't care who started it.
You both should be ashamed.
Okay, let's try it
once more from the top.
Hey. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.
I’m not doing this for you.
The truth is I’m doing this
for Sally.
Well, thank you anyway.
Choir, I’d like you to meet
our new soloist, Lilly.
-What's your last name?
-Tramp.
I knew this would happen.
No-no-no, wait, wait,
wait, please, please.
Let me handle this. Please.
Have you forgotten that Jesus
loved Mary Magdalene?
She was a ho.
“Let him who is without sin
cast the first stone.”
Thank you for handling it.
No, no, no, no, no,
I-I don't mean it.
I’m just saying it
for effect. Please.
It is your duty
to help fallen women.
I’m willing to help.
-Hi.
-I agree. It’s about time
we get some young Baptist booty
up in this choir.
Ask her how come she has to keep
so many husbands
away from their homes down
at that old sin hole
she be working at.
Would Aunt Sally
have been this harsh?
No.
No, Sally would've wanted Lilly
to stay in the choir...
-Amen.
-unlike some people.
-Amen again.
-That's right.
lf she was a respectable woman,
she would have
a respectable job.
The last thing we need
is another loose woman
up in the choir stand.
Now she should just
go on home, take care
of that little bastard baby...
Leave my son out of this.
Talk to her. Tell her.
Dean is a gift from God.
So is snow and rain,
but we still have
to wear our rubbers.
You know what Sally
told me once?
She said,
“When life makes you
have to put up
“with mean and hateful people,
“just think of them
as sandpaper.
“They may scratch you,
rub you the wrong way,
“but eventually...
you end up smooth and polished,
“and the sandpaper--
it's just going to be
worn out and ugly.”
Lilly, you don't need my help.
Now if I could get you all
to sing as well as you fight,
you'd be the baddest choir
in all of Georgia.
Now, Lilly is a member
of this choir
like everyone else.
lf you don't like it, well...
you can just leave.
Oh, well that's my cue.
Y'all coming?
Uh, Paulina,
I thought you were leaving.
The choir, yes,
but I’ll stay in this church
as long as I want.
I’m the treasurer.
Fine. Fine. Then we'll rehearse
with Lilly as our lead.
-Watch it, bro.
-Hey!
-Get down.
-That's mine. Right there.
Aw, man!
The Lord is good.
The Lord bless you.
Mr. Clean!
You know, I always
liked church.
There's a hell
of a lot more action
than in the barbershop.
Okay.
Ready?
Hold it.
Do I come in on the upbeat
or the downbeat?
Suit yourself. You're the pro.
Try the downbeat, honey.
I usually let the Neptunes
program on my upbeat, so...
Let's try it again
from the top.
Wait.
Aren't you going to arrange us
for the performance?
Right, right.
Lilly, Lilly, please, up.
Ladies, all three, up.
Okay, Tasha,
Tasha, please, down...
and, uh... oh,
please, yes, Bessie,
Alma and Miss Stringer.
Yeah, cute. Yes, yes,
there you go.
Okay. Young and foxy
in the front
and weird and funky
in the back...
but we love you.
All right. Ready?
From the top.
I’m... going...
Home!
Great! Yee-haw!
With a little more work,
I think we've got a real shot
at the Explosion.
And after that,
maybe even a record deal.
Then we'll tour on our own bus
with a clean bathroom.
A tour? Girl, like I’m going
to leave my granddaddy behind
by himself? Uh-uh.
Well, thankfully
all my family's dead.
That wasn't half bad.
It saddens me that the deadline
for entering the Gospel
Explosion has passed.
What?
“All audition tapes
are to be submitted
to audition judge
Luther Washington by...
yesterday afternoon.
She had something
to do with this.
I mean, you know, she...
Why didn't you say something?
You're the director now;
deadlines are your problem.
It’s been posted for weeks.
Where?
On the back
of the ladies' room door.
I sure as heck never saw it,
and I use that door every day.
You need to check
the girl's bathroom more often.
You mean we did all this work
-for nothing?
-Yeah.
And my best friend Keno
taught me how to do
the African Boot Dance.
Heck, I even stopped drinking.
Uh, I know that's a good thing,
-I-I’m just saying...
-Wait, wait, wait, listen, hey,
listen, everybody.
Just go home and don't worry.
Taking care of problems
is my specialty.
I’ll be back
in a couple of weeks,
and if I don't get a job,
I’m a dead man.
Yeah, I used my credit card
down here to fix a bus. Why?
They traced it. It was reported
to a credit bureau in Atlanta.
Well, what does that mean?
Felony, interstate fraud.
Just lay low, and stay away
from law enforcement.
Mr. Washington
will see you now.
Mr. Hill.
Lucius.
As a Christian man,
I do believe in mercy,
but as a prison warden,
I’m a stickler for the rules.
See, without rules,
society breaks down.
Sorry.
Listen...
Let me handle this.
Did I say you can talk?
-Look...
-Did I open my mouth
and say you could talk?
But I-I-I... I took
assertive tenderness.
I took assertiveness
training.
Look, Washington,
we're giving you an opportunity
to be a part of the
Belie Baptist...
Beulah.
The Beulah Baptist
Gospel Choir business.
Me, an opportunity?
Now, you need BBGC more
than BBGC needs you.
We're selling, not buying.
We're not selling.
We're... we are...
We're buying, not selling.
Now, you got 30 seconds
to m-make an offer,
or it's, you know?
We-we...
Let me think about it.
No.
Oh, come on.
Please, man.
-We'll pay you.
-Listen, listen.
Sir, you don't understand
the challenges my choir
and I have faced.
Please, just hear us sing.
We can be ready in a half hour.
No.
And I’m putting my foot down.
It’s a big “N” and a little “o.”
Sir, the entertainment
for today canceled.
And you know what happened
last time.
You said a half an hour?
Will you let us
into the Explosion?
Only if you guys can pass
the mustard with my prisoners.
Mustard's passed.
We'll blow them away.
Look, we got to do it,
or we won't get
into the Explosion.
Darrin, Darrin.
-Darrin, Darrin.
-Just relax.
They all look so scary.
Look, we're here now,
so I’m going to sing it.
What? Huh?
-What?
-Huh?
Swing low...
Join in, join in,

Sweet Lord

Take me home, Lord
I’m going home.
So look here, I guess that, uh,
your choir's
in the Gospel Explosion.
Don't let anyone know
I gave you any slack.
I have a reputation
as a hard ass
in the choir community.
Do you think
we have a shot at winning?
Hell, no.
You made it
through the audition, but...
I got prisoners that can sing
better than your choir.
Really?
Single file now.
Stay in line.
Guns in church.
The abomination that
causes desolation.
Guns ain't allowed?
Somebody should have told me.
Hey, big guy,
what's your name?
Oh.
My name is Johnson.
What are you in for?
Beating down somebody
for making fun of my high voice.
Okay, so let's take, uh...
Let's take it
from the top, shall we?
Uh, our felons first.
Up. Up, please.
Up.
Okay.
Um...
Gonna lay down my burdens...
Um, Mr. Briggs,
is there a problem?
It’s one thing for the state
to force us
to make license plates,
or work in chain gangs,
but to make us sing
in a choir?
That's cruel
and unusual punishment.
Mr. Johnson?
I used to be in a group,
and when we used to sing, uh,
“Down By the Riverside”--
there's a part of the song
where I used to
Wail.
You know, right at the end
with the sword and shield part.
People really liked that.
Would you like me
to do that for you?
All right.
What group did you sing with?
It doesn't matter.
They're dead now.
Right.
Okay, um...
Great.
And now, news time.
The Beulah Baptist Church Choir
now includes some
talented inmates
from our state prison system.
This could turn out
to be the breakout choir
of the year.
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I’m gonna lay down
my burdens, child
Down by the riverside
Yeah, down
Down by the riverside
Down
Down by the riverside
-Say, I’m...
-Ee-oop
I’m gonna lay down my burdens
Down by...
Down by the riverside
Say, I ain't
Study war
-No, no, no, no
-No more
Study war no more...
No more
Say, I’m going down
to the river
Gonna put my foot in
Gonna let it go up
to my knees
Gonna let it go down
to my thigh
And I ain't gonna
study war no more
No
Study war no more
-No
-Study war no more
l, l, l, l, l
Study war no more...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All that street-corner
barbershop harmony
That's cool, right?
We got some new hip-hop
in Monte Carlo, Georgia,
for y'all tonight-- yo, Briggs
I’m sick of packin'
all these nines
Slingin' dimes and smokin'
all the marijuana
Chillin' with pretty mamas from
Havana in the Bahamas
Most demons tryin' to see me
hot, like I’m in the sauna
And I’m just tryin' to get you
loose, kinda like Madonna
Call up everybody I know,
tell 'em it's time to go
Me and Bee-Z in the 6-4
sittin' real low
Got the roll to the riverside,
put that liquor to the side
Ain't no need for getting high,
stay alive, in touch
Helps you die, that cocaine,
get me trippin', y'all
Never been lickin' that,
none of my burdens
Because I don't wanna
be left and burnin'
Flirtin' with death
And they promise
my last breath
Dressed in prison blues
Holy Spirit got me under arrest
I used to be a thug,
sold drugs
Might have stalked you
Stepped up in the church,
got converted at the altar
And I fought 'ya
Fell back and he caught you
Out tryin' to floss,
better live what he taught you
Goin' down
We goin' down to the river
Take it to the river
Goin' down, baby
Yo, yo
Down to the river
Take it to the river
And lay down
Haulin' my glocks
and automatics
I’m charismatic,
like crack addicts
You wreak havoc like
road ragers in bad traffic
It gets drastic,
but He's fantastic
 In attracting no one packing,
now we're fasting
Has the passion, how can I get
this life everlasting?
Sick of blastin' and dashin',
flashin' like Charles Manson
Give me the ransom, now
we're glory, holla, dancin'
I’m flippin' and rippin'
to come up with lyrical styles
Y'all never heard
Tryin' to reach you
climb the stair
Beyond all of this
trippin' birds
Forget the English but rhymes,
but I’m the jefe
They bust the rich, bringin'
beats like Tito Puente
Salsa, merengue,
repos calientes
Azucar sabroso
para ti and para mi
Goin' down
Oh, as long as they
praising God's name,
it's all right with me.
The congregation is going to be
in for a surprise come Sunday.
Yeah, let me
know how it goes.
I expect you to be there, too.
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
I’m goin' down, baby
We goin' down to the river
We
So
Hot
We
Don't
Stop
We take it to the river
You know, we go down, down
We goin' down to the river
Take it to the river
Goin' down...
Glad you're here, Reverend.
I suppose you've noticed
how the choir has grown.
I-I was just seeing
how good they are.
I also suppose you plan
on enforcing the rules
and the bylaws
that says all members
of the choir
must be baptized
and take Bible-study classes.
Oh, now, Paulina.
You can't change that.
It’ll change everything.
She has a point, Darrin.
What point is that?
lf you change things,
then they'll be different?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I’m sorry, Darrin.
But if they're going to stay,
they're going to have to abide
by the church rules.
I can't swim.
Uh, don't worry, Mr. Johnson.
It’s just a...
just a little sprinkle.
I won't do it.
We're broadcasting live
from down by the riverside
where three lost souls
are trying to find Jesus.
Although personally,
I don't think
this is where he fell in.
I baptize you in the
name of the Father,
and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost.
Burns.
It burns.
Oh, brother, it's just the waste
from the refinery upstream,
you see?
Well, guess that about does it.
Oh, funny thing, Darrin.
I don't remember
you being baptized.
Do you, Paul?
Oh, uh... uh... uh...
Well, you know l...
-Paul?!
-No, I don't.
I am not getting
in that water.
Uh-huh.
I am not getting in there.
-Uh-huh.
-Shit.
Must be crazy.
Praise the Lord.
Yeah, yeah,
come on, come on, y'all
We about to get our praise on
in this piece right now
Y'all know how we do it
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

and I don't want to let it in

Every time I praise His name

It rains down on me.
Thanks for coming with me.
Alma gave me the key,
but I felt kind of creepy
coming here by myself.
Just got to get
this box of letters
before everything
is packed away.
They said it was in a trunk.
I didn't even know Mama
was writing these.
I always thought she lost
contact with everyone here.
1985.
“Dear Sally, I think
this will be my big year.
“We're settled
into our apartment
and the rent is covered.”
She has “Thanks” in parentheses.
Sally.
“Here's a picture of Darrin.
Doesn't he look like
a future doctor or lawyer?”
Eww.
This one was actually
addressed to you
from Aunt Sally.
It says “Return to Sender.”
It’s because I moved
around a lot.
Oh, my God.
Not that funny.
Dear Darrin,
I’m worried about you.
All the different addresses
and phone numbers.
The people calling here
looking for you.
You seem to be lying
about who you are.
Why can't you accept
who you are?
God accepts you.
New York is so dangerous,
criminals, crazy people, and me
if I have to come up there
and whip your ass.
Up there acting like
you ain't got no home training.
It’s my fault.
I never should have let Paulina
run your mom out.
I love you, Darrin.
I’m the only family you have,
and you're the only family
I have.
What does the letter say?
Something in my eye.
What does the letter say?
Oh, just stuff, stuff
I probably should have known.
Let me see your eye.
-Huh? Oh.
-Let me see your eye.
She looks kind of disapproving.
