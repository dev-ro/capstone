Bowen Tyler: I do not expect
anyone to believe
the story
I'm about to relate.
It even seems
incredible to me
that all that I have
passed through...
...all those weird
and terrifying experiences,
should have been encompassed
within as short a span
as three brief months.
It must have been
a little after
3:00 in the afternoon
that it began.
The afternoon
of June 3, 1916.

Besides...
these were civilians.

We were torpedoed.
Looks like we're
the only survivors.
Will they find us?

Where are you?!

Man #2: There
on the port bow,
Mr. Bradley.
Bradley: Rest oars.
Up you come,
me darlin'.
Welcome aboard,
Miss Clayton,
Mr. Tyler.
Sinclair, if you
look in my bag,
There's some brandy.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Tyler.
Did any of the other
boats get away?
I'm afraid not.
We were sure lucky
to find you.
Olson,
take the tiller.
Not quite so lucky
I'm afraid.
We've only got about
a half gallon of water
And no food.
Young Whiteley managed
to get through with an SOS,
but had no chance
to tell them where
our position was.
As far as they're
concerned, we...
...we could
be anywhere.

To surface and

It can't be

We're too far

( GURGLING )
It's a U-Boat.
It must be the one
that sunk us.
We'd better take cover
until it submerges.
No, wait. if we get aboard,
we can surprise them
As they come
through the hatch.
We wouldn't
stand a chance.
It's the only
chance we have.
I know these boats
like the back of my hand.
Now, we've got
about two minutes
Before that hatch opens.
Right.
Let's try it.

Good work, Bradley.
Well, commander,
now that you have us,
What do you propose
to do with us?
Are you all right?
I'm fine, thank you.
I'll tell you what we're
gonna do with you, captain--
Put you in the nearest
British port.
And you expect me
to take you there?
Captain von Schoenvorts.
Schoenvorts.
I'm afraid
you have no choice.
And how will you know
if I'm coursing
For England or Germany?
We're all seamen,
captain.
We know how to
read a compass.
Oh, and
von Schoenvorts...
I don't suppose
you've heard
Of the Tylers
of Santa Monica?
Well, I'm Bowen Tyler,
And my father was
building these submarines
Before you even
thought of them.
Bradley:
stop him, Jones!
( SMASHING SOUNDS )
Hold it!

( EQUIPMENT BUZZING )
Now there's no chance
of contacting Allied shipping.
von Schoenvorts:
may I suggest,
Mr. Tyler, that--
I'll suggest.
I suggest, captain,
Captain von Schoenvorts...
...that you tell your men
that we're in control,
And if you don't...
You'll find
you and your crew
Where you found us--
in the water.
achtung,
von Schoenvorts...
this boat is now
under command
of our enemy--
Mr. Tyler.
You will obey his orders...
for the time being.
Lock him up, Bradley.
Bradley, is that
a British warship?
It is indeed.
we're in luck.
We think we've spotted
a British warship. Stand by.
Keep signaling.
A few more of those,
and they'll have our range.
It's no good!
they don't read us!
Or they don't believe us.

Tyler: there was only
one thing we could do--
head the U-Boat
on a western course
and try to reach
a neutral American port
before our fuel ran out.
Bradley...
We've been going due west
for six days now...
...yet in all this time
We haven't seen
one single ship.
And having crossed
the Atlantic,
We should have sighted
The North American
coast by now.
This sure as hell isn't
North Atlantic weather,
Not this time of the year.
Dietz.
Either the sun
is rising in the south...
Or our compass
has been tampered with.
We've been going south
for six days.
( SIGHS )
My guess...
is right here.
But that's
South America.
Exactly where
I wanted to go.
Schwartz,
take the helm.
Did you think that as
commander of this ship
I would not have
a master key?
Now, there is
a German supply ship
Operating
in this area...
...and we should
rendezvous within the hour.
And you, commander...
Will be
transferred to her
And shot as a pirate.
I apologize for
disturbing you,
Miss Clayton.
Might I collect
some of my papers?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Well, are you making
yourself comfortable?
Yes, thank you,
captain.
Good.
Did you know that
Mr. Tyler was planning
To take us to New England?
I find his
Yankee ingeniousness
Almost frightening.
You know,
I'm a biologist, captain.
I study the structure
of living things,
Their motivations,
and their behavior,
But I don't
understand you.
How can anyone who is
so interested in life
Follow a profession
which is devoted
To destruction
and killing?
The study of nature,
Miss Clayton,
has taught me
that life is founded
upon killing
and destruction.
The sea swarms
with living things
That prey on one another
to survive.
But human beings needn't.
The ship you torpedoed
contained nothing
But innocent passengers--
women and children.
And a hold full
of arms and ammunition
That would be used
to kill women and children
in my country.
Oh, yes.
How else would it have
exploded so quickly?
Anyway...
We will talk again,
Miss Clayton.
Good-bye.

Let's give them
a surprise.
Tubes flooded.

Nice shooting, Mr. Tyler.
She had fuel,
supplies, fresh water.
We have enough supplies
for one week.
what do you propose
to do now, commander?
Bradley, put
Captain von Schoenvorts
Back in the cooler.
Take him with you.
Get on the helm,
Dietz.
We conserve our fuel,
we go on half rations.
And we'll see where
the current will take us.
Precisely.
Against my
better judgment,
Your instincts have
proved to be right so far.
I can handle my crew.
You understand submarines.
I consider that to be
our good fortune, commander.
Mr. Bradley.
Icebergs.
No.
There are no icebergs
north of 14 in these waters.
That much I know.
Then we must be
south of 14, Dietz.
Impossible.
Hello, sir.
Hello, Sinclair.
Open the door.
Right, sir.
Captain.
Mr. Tyler.
Come on.
Sit down.
Would you like a drink?
Captain von Schoenvorts,
I, uh...
I need your help.
You need my help?
How?
We're lost.
I will help you.
No tricks.
No tricks.
What do you make of it?
Did you ever
hear of Caproni?
An early
Italian navigator.
He followed Cook
about 1721.
People scoffed
at his claims,
But I remember
reading in his book
In which he describes
a new continent
In the south seas--
A rockbound
inhospitable coast
Without beach or harbor
Where he could
make no landing.
He saw no sign of life.
He called it Caprona
and sailed away.
I believe that we are looking
at the coast of Caprona--
Uncharted and forgotten
for 200 years.
Well, we'll have to
do what he couldn't do--
Find a place to land.
If we don't...
...we'll die.
It seems
there's no way in.
It is warm.
Mr. Bradley.
It's warm water, sir.
What is it?
What'd you find?
Well, this is fresh water,
and it's warm.
There must be a river
flowing into
the sea near here.
von Schoenvorts:
Mr. Tyler!
There is your river.
Olson:
An underground river?
We'll need
the wings of angels
to find out
where it starts.
I don't think so,
Mr. Olson,
Not with this submarine.
If that tunnel's
as big as it looks,
We might get through.

Is plesiosaurus
a common dish
In the British navy,
Mr. Olson?
Ah, no, ma'am.
The chef confessed
complete ignorance
of how to cook
such a beast.
This is an old
Irish recipe
I dreamed up
for the occasion.
Thank you, Olson.
Bon appétit.
Thank you,
Mr. Olson.
Should one drink
white or red wine
With plesiosaurus,
Herr von Schoenvorts?
( CHUCKLES )
Mmm. Excellent.
Commander, I have
a proposition for you.
For us here,
the war in Europe
Is meaningless, yes?
And I suggest that we
forget those differences
And work together
for our mutual survival.
That sounds good
in principle,
Captain
von Schoenvorts,
But what if
we were to find
Some means of escape?
In that event,
We will take the submarine
to a neutral port
And surrender
to the authorities.
All right.
But who's
gonna command
Our little force
in Caprona?
I will command my men,
Mr. Bradley his,
The three of us
will make the rules,
And you, Mr. Tyler,
as a sort of neutral,
Will be in charge.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Our time together,
gentlemen,
promises to be
extremely interesting.
Well, gentlemen,
what do you make of it?
Lisa: I'd say Caprona
was a volcanic crater.
A volcano,
Miss Clayton?
Mm-hmm.
But it's at least,
oh, 200 miles across.
I'd say it could be
the largest volcano
in the history
of our planet.
Ah, good.
Gentlemen,
will you excuse me?
I want to analyze
these samples
From a very
remarkable river.
Lisa: the water's
absolutely alive.
von Schoenvorts:
they're not like anything
I've ever seen before.
They almost seem
to have a purpose.

Until we find

That is free of them,
We will have
no drinking water.

Now we should go.

Can we take him

He may be of use to us.

was right.
the creatures of Caprona
were like those
that existed
in prehistoric times.
and the further
we followed the river north,
the more highly-developed
they became.

what do you make of it?

And the simpler.

that we divide the men
into groups,
and each group
takes turns
hunting,

And the spawn we looked at

how life begins on Caprona.
That's the secret.

must lay eggs in this way.

spurned by even
the highest--the Ga-lu.
so we have to go on
in the way of Caprona
till we find peace.
I would rather
live here with Lisa
than to live elsewhere
without her.
And she says the same of me.
If God wills it,
we shall live our lives here.
However,
we are determined
to move ever northward,
ever forward,
toward the greater mysteries
that lie ahead
of this Land that Time Forgot.
